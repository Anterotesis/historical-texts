<P>THE MUSICAL TOUR OF <HI>Mr. DIBDIN</HI>; IN WHICH&mdash;PREVIOUS TO HIS EMBARKATION FOR INDIA&mdash;HE FINISHED HIS CAREER AS A PUBLIC CHARACTER.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to announce, by way of adverti&s;ement, that on account of the prodi|gious circuit this TOUR comprehends; the unavoidable alterations as to the time of its pub|lication; and a variety of other concurrent circum&s;tances&mdash;the whole of the &s;ub&s;cribers' names were not received in time to <HI>extend</HI> the number of this impre&s;&s;ion, which, from the uncertainty of what might be its reception, I have to lament was fixed <HI>ab origine</HI> at <HI>&s;ix hundred.</HI> The following li&s;t contains names for five hundred and fifty-&s;even copies&mdash;the re|mainder of the impre&s;&s;ion I mean to take with me to INDIA&mdash;which I flatter my&s;elf will not be deemed an offence by tho&s;e who have &s;ub&s;cribed and cannot be &s;upplied, as it will be im|po&s;&s;ible, my engagements being already made, to wait for the &s;econd edition, though it is already begun.</P>
<P>It would be departing from every principle I have profe&s;&s;ed, to con&s;ider the overplus &s;ub&s;cribers&mdash;who I am proud to notice already amount to nearly two hundred&mdash;as <HI>chance customers</HI>; it would be as unfair not to act upon the plan of <HI>first come first &s;erved</HI>; tho&s;e ladies and gentlemen therefore&mdash;many of who&s;e names have been procured through the con&s;pi|cuous patronage which gives &s;uch lu&s;tre to this work, and would con&s;equently HEIGHTEN AND ADORN IT&mdash;are reque&s;ted to ob&s;erve, that in &s;ix weeks, a much larger impre&s;&s;ion will be publi&s;hed, when they will be &s;upplied with copies, and their names added to the li&s;t. It is proper al&s;o to &s;pecify&mdash;to put every thing upon an equitable footing&mdash;that no per&s;on will be con&s;idered as a non &s;ub&s;criber till the 12th of June&mdash;previous to which day &s;ub&s;cribers names will be received by Mr. PRESTON, at his Mu&s;ic Warehou&s;e, No. 97, in the Strand.</P>
<P>I cannot fini&s;h this adverti&s;ement without lamenting that a prior engagement obliges Mr. GALES to relinqui&s;h printing the &s;econd edition of this publication; in con&s;equence of which it is begun in LONDON&mdash;where even if the original &s;hould be improved upon, it will be no triumph, as there will not be the &s;ame di&s;advantages to encounter.</P>
<P>For all further particulars, the public is re&s;pectfully referred to &s;uch articles in the new&s;papers as will be publi&s;hed through that authority I &s;hall leave behind me.</P>

<HEAD>To T. S. E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am perfectly aware that no man ought to obtrude him&s;elf unnece&s;&s;arily on the public&mdash;but when chance has thrown in the way of even the meane&s;t individual occa&s;ion to remark on a variety of matters that lead to &s;uch information as may afford general or particular in&s;truction and amu&s;ement, I know no rea&s;on why &s;uch a labour &s;hould not a&s;pire to popular notice.</P>
<P>Upon this principle&mdash;I addre&s;s, to the be&s;t judge I know of all general &s;ubjects, whether natural or acquired, my MUSICAL TOUR. In which I have had opportunity, at different times, to laugh, to deplore, to pity, and applaud&mdash;it has excited, in &s;ome in&s;tances, my a&s;toni&s;hment; in others, my indifference; it has called forth my warme&s;t gratitude, and moved my ineffable contempt.</P>
<P>The provocation of the&s;e different feelings, of cour&s;e, had its ri&s;e from my different public and individual reception. I have been lo&s;t in admiration
<PB N="2" REF="9">
at the benignant liberality of one man in power, and obliged to &s;helter my&s;elf under a &s;ort of contemptuous compa&s;&s;ion at the ignorant importance of another. I have been charmed to wonder at profe&s;&s;ional candour, and I have &s;miled, un|moved, at profe&s;&s;ional envy. I have warmed to delight at in&s;tances of private friend&s;hip, and have beheld with unhappine&s;s, and forgiven, wanton attempts to do me private injuries.</P>
<P>As for my public reception, it has been flattering in the extreme, as far as it relates to applau&s;e. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the &s;ame as to profit. One advan|tage I have certainly reaped from it&mdash;my country experience has given me a more competent view of popular opinion than all I had before done. I believe it may be owing to my having conver&s;ed with my audience, and taken them at the moment I made them feel. Among the number, however, who have at|tended me, I &s;hall not ea&s;ily forget the few who are firmly convinced I am a mo&s;t impudent impo&s;tor&mdash;for that Mr. DIBDIN ama&s;&s;ed &s;o large a fortune by the <HI>Padlock</HI> and the <HI>Jubilee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the truth of this matter &s;ee the &s;tatement of my profits for dramatic pieces.</NOTE> as to be perfectly independent; whereas I &s;troll about the country; that I am a &s;tout, jolly young man, in my own hair, whereas Mr. DIBDIN is a tall, thin man, and wears a wig<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more curious than popular prejudices. I know a clergyman who, having enjoyed for &s;everal years the world's good opinion, was turned off, through a ridiculous pique, by a young no|bleman to whom he was preceptor. After his di&s;grace every vice and folly that could taint a man's character was attributed to him. He drank, wenched, and was &s;o complete a gambler, that, had he kept his old &s;ituation much longer, he would have ruined the principles of his pupil. I know him well&mdash;and am convinced he is free from all the&s;e vices, and in particular as to play.&mdash;I declare I once &s;aw him, in a &s;ingle game at whi&s;t, <HI>revoke five times.</HI></NOTE>. On this &s;ubject I have a large &s;tock of Anecdotes, which you will get in their place.</P>
<P>This TOUR al&s;o will, as far as opportunity has permitted me, give the public &s;ome u&s;eful hints relative to inns, manufactories, natural and artificial curio&s;ities, the &s;tate of the country as to cultivation, and &s;uch other particulars as have cur&s;orily &s;truck me&mdash;and, really, Mr. PATERSON ought to &s;ub&s;cribe
<PB N="3" REF="10">
hand&s;omely&mdash;for I &s;hall be able to improve his road book, which, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, is very erroneous. Having al&s;o had many opportunities of conver&s;ing with men of genius, I &s;hall communicate my remarks on tho&s;e conver&s;ations; in which, in particular, will be compri&s;ed my &s;entiments on MUSIC in all its points of view; for, to tell you a &s;ecret, while I merely con&s;idered my&s;elf as a public man, I held up di&s;dain as a &s;hield to ward off the &s;hafts of envy, and conceived my&s;elf under no obligation to blunt that malignity which neither gave me pain, nor injured me in the opinions of the candid and liberal. Hav|ing, however, made my election to cramp my&s;elf no more in the trammels of public drudgery, I mean, without favour or affection, hone&s;tly to point out, that mu&s;ic neither is, nor ought to be, what it is repre&s;ented; that a know|ledge of it, &s;ufficiently competent for all common purpo&s;es, is to be ea&s;ily at|tained; and, in &s;hort, to &s;hew the world how to beware of counterfeits, for &s;uch are abroad&mdash;and, as I pledge my&s;elf to do this fully and fairly, I have no fear of &s;ucceeding to the di&s;comfiture of all &s;uch as have maintained that I am no mu&s;ician, that I do not know the nature of harmony, a &s;ingle method in modulation, or a rule in compo&s;ition. Another object which peculiarly de|mands my attention is the THEATRE. Nor will a fair expo&s;ition of its arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication. An ac|count of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my compact with the public, and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatrical tran&s;actions&mdash;be&s;ides, a recent corre&s;pondence with Mr. HARRIS ac|tually comes within the meaning of the TOUR, and as I con&s;ider my&s;elf under an examination&mdash;and, what ought to be &s;erious indeed, a &s;elf-examination&mdash;would it not be unpardonable to conceal any part of the truth? which, for my comfort, will infallibly be credited; becau&s;e, cea&s;ing to be a public man, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any intere&s;t in what I do.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters, together with a prodigious number of ob&s;ervations, both of my own and others, on all general &s;ubjects&mdash;anecdotes, and the e&s;&s;ence of what I have delivered, at different places, under the title of READINGS and
<PB N="4" REF="11">
MUSIC, will make up a &s;eries of letters which, as they are to contain the re|marks of a man long in the habit of admini&s;tering to the plea&s;ure of the public, will, I tru&s;t, with the advantage of your &s;entiments on each &s;eparate letter, be found to excite and &s;atisfy public curio&s;ity. Thus, you &s;ee, like Othello, I could take a hint&mdash;no &s;ooner had you &s;ignified a wi&s;h that I &s;hould addre&s;s the&s;e letters to you, than I plumed my&s;elf upon that opportunity of introducing them eligibly to the world, and I hope you will &s;u&s;tain no di&s;grace in this liberty taken by,</P>

<HEAD>To T. S. E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A mea&s;ure, without a motive, is a &s;uper&s;tructure without a foundation. There has been as much &s;peculation on my becoming an itinerant, as might, in France, have procured me the honour of a <HI>lettre de cachet.</HI> Vainly I &s;ay, at the bottom of my bills, that, having received a long and liberal patronage from the public, I come to thank that body for having amply requited my &s;ervices. Say the cavillers, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'your argument makes again&s;t you. Had you drawn &s;o much money as you report, the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure would not have been worth your while; and if you are &s;uch a favourite, why not continue in a &s;ervice that has procured you &s;uch reputation?'</Q> Some few I have &s;et right in the&s;e particulars&mdash;the re&s;t are referred to this very letter, which &s;hall <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a round, unvarni&s;hed tale unfold."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then&mdash;I certainly have received more public applau&s;e than any En|gli&s;h compo&s;er, except ARNE; nor was it lea&s;t when I could boa&s;t of that glo|rious competitor's friend&s;hip. Can any other than my&s;elf count upwards of ninety &s;ongs of his own compo&s;ition, that have been encored? and yet I never in my life wrote a &s;ingle puff on my own account&mdash;but, on the contrary, con&s;tantly reprobated that contemptible &s;upport of imbecility, and rotten prop
<PB N="7" REF="14">
of debilitated reputation. Out of nearly &s;ixty pieces which I have written and compo&s;ed, and which, before I have done, I will enumerate, no one has been actually damned&mdash;three only have been withdrawn&mdash;<HI>The Shepherde&s;s of the Alps,</HI> which was mi&s;erably performed&mdash;<HI>The Chel&s;ea Pen&s;ioner,</HI> which was actually &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to have four &s;ongs encored on the la&s;t night it was repre&s;ented&mdash;and <HI>Amphytrion,</HI> which I was compelled to write on a plan I never approved. Many of the remainder have been performed more than thirty nights, &s;ome more than &s;ixty, in the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on&mdash;not to mention tho&s;e which con&s;tantly keep the &s;tage, and are favourites all over the kingdom; and yet, among the&s;e I have not included the <HI>Padlock,</HI> the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> nor any of tho&s;e pieces which, though compo&s;ed by me, are not of my writing. A reception like this is evi|dently a liberal one, and mu&s;t have brought an immen&s;e &s;um of money&mdash;but to whom? To the managers of the theatre&mdash;who have con&s;tantly the oy&s;ter, while the poet and compo&s;er divide the &s;hells. Thus, uniting both tho&s;e cha|racters in my&s;elf, I have been encumbered with two &s;hells in&s;tead of one&mdash;for fame, after all, like a theatrical banquet, though very <HI>fine,</HI> is not EATABLE. The&s;e rea&s;ons, which, I tru&s;t, bear no marks of vanity, &s;ince they are plain facts, and I offer them only in my vindication, will &s;hew that, though I have been hand&s;omely paid, yet it has been in a coin advantageous to no other being than a camelion; and, as I am no air eater, but, on the contrary, love, as well as any body, the good things of this world, my intention is certainly to go where I am informed they are to be found.</P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, I have made the matter fairly demon&s;trable, without the &s;malle&s;t depreciation of the public liberality. <HI>They</HI> gave the money, and <HI>I</HI> the plea&s;ure; and, therefore, I have not the lea&s;t doubt but they had rather I had received the profit.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s&mdash;I &s;hould have made the be&s;t of the&s;e bad bargains, and jogged on in the old way, had it not been evident that my unfortunate con|nection with the Circus barred the doors of the theatre&mdash;or rather, left them
<PB N="8" REF="15">
a little open, that they might &s;queeze me the harder. I have had no piece &s;ince <HI>Amphytrion</HI> but <HI>Liberty Hall,</HI> which, after having <HI>nine</HI> &s;ongs encored the FIRST night (&s;ix of which were repeated, and the other three excu&s;ed, out of compa&s;&s;ion to the performers) was <HI>hi&s;&s;ed by a party</HI> on the <HI>tenth,</HI> and immediately withdrawn. This cannot po&s;&s;ibly be attributable to Mr. LINLEY&mdash;for, though, eleven years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance de&s;erves to be told. I had certainly no expectation at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> after GARRICK retired from it. Poor BRERETON, however, to whom Mr. SHERIDAN was under obligations wi&s;hing me to remain at the theatre, made his friend promi&s;e that I &s;hould return to my old &s;ituation. As Mr. BRERETON is dead, I &s;hould not venture to a&s;&s;ert this as a po&s;itive fact, had not Mr. SHERIDAN con|fe&s;&s;ed he had made &s;uch a promi&s;e; not, however, without &s;aying he was &s;orry for it; as he was &s;ure my being at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> would cau&s;e a heart-burning between Mr. LINLEY and me. He had, neverthe|le&s;s, he &s;aid, done &s;omething that would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well&mdash;having prevailed with Mr. HARRIS to engage me as compo&s;er to <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> At his de&s;ire I called on Mr. HARRIS, who a&s;&s;ured me, and I &s;incerely believe him, that he had never <HI>any conver&s;ation</HI> WHATEVER on the &s;ubject. His words were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;urely Mr. SHERIDAN's mad."</Q> No engagement of cour&s;e took place, and I went to France.&mdash;While I am on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall mention, that there are moments when mean men are a&s;hamed of their own littlene&s;s. At my return from France I made a verbal engagement with Mr. HARRIS, to the exclu&s;ion of all others, as compo&s;er to the hou&s;e. Let it be remembered I do not &s;ay this to accu&s;e him of incon&s;i&s;tency&mdash;it was certainly his intention not to have a compo&s;er, till the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Poor Vulcan</HI> induced him to alter his mind. It was at this time the theatrical coalition had taken place, and Mr. HARRIS and his colleague were never a&s;under. One morning I came to a rehear&s;al rather before the time, and found the&s;e gentlemen talking on the &s;tage. Mr. HARRIS, to whom I had that morning &s;ent the hunting &s;ong beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"give round the word di&s;mount di&s;mount,"</Q> came to me very eagerly, to thank me for my expedition in getting it ready. Mr. SHERIDAN, who could not avoid &s;eeing me, &s;eemed not to know me. We talked a good while, on different &s;ubjects, during which time, to do his mode&s;ty ju&s;tice, with all his con&s;ummate eloquence, he knew not what to &s;ay. At length, finding he mu&s;t &s;peak to me, he called Mr. HARRIS a&s;ide, and a&s;ked him who I was&mdash;and, being informed, he came up to me to make an apology for, as he &s;aid, not knowing me. I might be altered, but &s;o was he&mdash;for, when I before &s;aw him, he was as remarkably &s;pruce, as, at the time I mention, he was remarkably &s;lovenly. Said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. DIBDIN, I beg your pardon a thou&s;and times&mdash;I had not the &s;malle&s;t recollec|tion of you. I don't know how it is&mdash;but&mdash;you are &s;trangely altered.

<PB N="9" REF="16">
a promi&s;e he had made of giving me the &s;ituation of compo&s;er to the hou&s;e, which I had &s;even years held under Mr. GARRICK, by telling me that a connection with <HI>Drury-lane</HI> would certainly cau&s;e a heart-burning&mdash;though in the affair of <HI>Liberty Hall</HI> Mr. LINLEY protracted the benefit till it was no benefit at all&mdash;though Mr. LINLEY po&s;itively accu&s;ed a friend of mine as the author of the above &s;upererogate damnation, which friend has given me many &s;trong and unequivocal proofs that he is no dealer in words only&mdash;though I had the honour of kicking my heels in Mr. LINLEY's hall about thirty times in one &s;ea&s;on, concerning a farce which was cur&s;orily read, liked, re|vi&s;ed, and at length returned through the medium of the under prompter&mdash;which farce, by way of parenthe&s;is, I afterwards &s;ent to Mr. HARRIS, who returned it, writing me word I had better get it performed at <HI>Drury-lane</HI>&mdash;though, notwith&s;tanding all this, I &s;ince &s;ent two pieces to Mr. LINLEY which were returned <HI>unread</HI>&mdash;and, la&s;tly, though Mr. LINLEY, to put the matter upon a footing, wrote me a letter, &s;aying they did not want <HI>my talents</HI> at <HI>Drury-lane</HI>&mdash;yet, Mr. LINLEY's character as a fair, candid, hone&s;t man; free from littlene&s;s, and above all <HI>envy</HI>&mdash;his diffidence of his own merit, which he has often confe&s;&s;ed to me did not at all qualify him for dramatic compo&s;itions&mdash;in &s;hort, his amiable private virtues, his wonderful public abi|lities, which are &s;o real that they are ten times over repeated almo&s;t every day in almo&s;t every new&s;paper. All the&s;e abundantly prove that the above-related circum&s;tances, though &s;elf-evident, have, &s;omehow or other, like a &s;ham flaw in a good indictment, a &s;ort of apparent defection; and can, by &s;pecious and ingenious arguments, which are a great deal better, becau&s;e more fa&s;hion|able, than plain truth and common &s;en&s;e, be made to qua&s;h the charge; and not only &s;hew the accu&s;ed immaculately innocent, but gro&s;&s;ly injured. But to drop all plea&s;antry&mdash;are not the&s;e fardels of the mind? and if &s;o&mdash;are they not incomparably more galling and ponderous than tho&s;e of the body? Mine, however, will always be relieved by the reflection that I have a friend like you, and the plea&s;ure I take in a&s;&s;uring you that I am unfeignedly yours,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Tri&s;tram Shandy was a long while employed on writing his hi&s;tory before he was born, &s;o I &s;hall be &s;ome time getting on with my MUSICAL TOUR before I &s;et out. My motive which I talked of in the la&s;t letter is like a quantity of vivid quick&s;ilver, which, being touched, &s;eparates into a number of &s;maller globules. The&s;e, in order to go on with preci&s;ion, it mu&s;t be my ta&s;k to &s;weep again into the original ma&s;s&mdash;or, to &s;peak le&s;s circularly&mdash;it will be proper to touch on all that train of &s;ubordinate events which induced me to mu&s;ter up the <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary re&s;olution of roving into foreign parts. To do this without a retrogade motion, for I hate every thing ungraceful, I &s;hall not go regularly back, but at once &s;kip to that period when, in con&s;equence of a difference of opinion with Mr. HARRIS, about the mode of altering <HI>Amphytrion</HI>&mdash;which, being done his way, was, as I predicted, performed without &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;that gentleman and I &s;eparated. At that time I applied to a friend of mine to enter into &s;ome &s;cheme with me, who prevailed on &s;everal other gentlemen to join him in building the Circus. The hi&s;tory of that place&mdash;the infamy of its pre&s;ent occupier&mdash;the blindne&s;s of the Surry magi&s;trates&mdash;the ill treatment of the proprietors&mdash;and my incorrigible
<PB N="11" REF="18">
weakne&s;s and folly in tamely &s;uffering &s;o many impo&s;itions, would make up matter for a much larger work than this I am writing&mdash;but, as I will not pay your patience &s;o ill a compliment as to require that you &s;hould rake in a jakes, and as al&s;o I mean, in my public decea&s;e, to die in peace with all men, I &s;hall only &s;ay that, having laboured four times more during three years than any other man ever did, I found I had nothing for it but to regain the theatres. This was certainly a forlorn hope, and I &s;truggled with it as long as I could. In particular, I had the plea&s;ure of kicking down about 290l. by building a ca&s;tle in the air near Pancras, by virtue of an agreement with the famous&mdash;I had almo&s;t added another &s;yllable&mdash;JACOB LEROUX, E&s;q. architect, brick-maker, and trading-ju&s;tice in the di&s;trict of Clerkenwell. This gentleman, with a da&s;tardly &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s for which a Hyena might envy him, promi&s;ed me a licen&s;e in the name of &s;everal magi&s;trates <HI>who oppo&s;ed the motion,</HI> and know|ing, I &s;uppo&s;e, the actual value of the prote&s;tations he had made, erected the &s;keleton of a building, which was blown down by the fir&s;t high wind after the licence was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Foiled thus in every attempt at independancy, I did my utmo&s;t to get reconnected with the theatres, but to no purpo&s;e. One manoeuvre, which I practi&s;ed to accompli&s;h this, de&s;erves notice. I got a friend to pre&s;ent a co|medy to <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> without naming the author, who had &s;o much intere&s;t, that Mr. SHERIDAN him&s;elf read about half a dozen pages, and prai&s;ed them. The re&s;t of the piece was read by Mrs. SHERIDAN, who liked it very much. It was then referred to Mr. TICKEL, who referred it to Mrs. TICKEL, who read and approved it. After this, Mr. TICKEL pronounced that, with a few alterations, it would do; and &s;omething was in agitation, though never com|pleted, concerning an accommodation for 100l. till the piece &s;hould make its appearance. My friend is &s;ince gone abroad&mdash;and &s;eeing I had nothing el&s;e for it, I wrote to Mr. TICKEL, &s;etting him right concerning the author of the comedy, and de&s;iring to have it returned. Though I took a great deal of pains to get an an&s;wer to the letter, I have never yet received one, and the piece of
<PB N="12" REF="19">
cour&s;e remains in their hands. As I &s;hall certainly, throughout the whole of this work, be very tenacious of advancing what I do not po&s;itively, and from my own conviction, know to be fact. I &s;hall remark upon the above&mdash;that, as I had no communication whatever with Mr. TICKEL concerning this &s;ame co|medy, I could come at what I have related through my friend's account only. I have a pretty &s;trong <HI>pre&s;umptive</HI> proof, however, that it is literally true; for, during the tran&s;action, to clench the bu&s;ine&s;s, which the readers &s;ee it did with a vengeance, a near relation of Mr. TICKEL had a curacy given him of two liv|ings, not an hundred miles from <HI>Bedford,</HI> by the very gentleman who pre|&s;ented the comedy. Another friend, in the &s;ame manner, &s;ent an afterpiece to Mr. HARRIS, who returned it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though it had great theatrical merit, it would not do on the &s;tage."</Q>&mdash;Hear this, ye would-be-witlings, and rejoice! theatrical merit is no longer a dramatic requi&s;ite! This piece is now in the hands of Mr. COLMAN, who, by agreement, was to have per|formed it during his late &s;ea&s;on&mdash;but, whether he did not wi&s;h to ri&s;que the principal character with any body but Mr. PALMER, which is the rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igned to me, adding, that the piece was &s;o well written it de&s;erved good actors, for that it was in the &s;tyle of the <HI>Guardian,</HI> but more delicate&mdash;or, whe|ther he was &s;hocked at the cruel and inhuman murder of <HI>Harve&s;t Home</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;tatement of pieces.</NOTE>&mdash;or, in &s;hort, whatever may be his rea&s;ons, it &s;till lies in his hands. I even, to leave nothing untried, made an agreement with Mr. DALY, the Iri&s;h ma|nager, which, after being broken, on his &s;ide, three times, yielded me, in three years, about 120l.&mdash;whereas, had it been properly kept, I mu&s;t have received &s;ix times that &s;um.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf therefore in the &s;tate of ADAM, with all the world before me, where to chu&s;e&mdash;for I have pretty well proved that the theatrical paradi&s;e was &s;hut again&s;t me&mdash;it &s;truck me that the warm and fo&s;tering climate of ASIA might revive a drooping plant that had been neglected in its native &s;oil; but then, as Mr. BAYS &s;ays, came in the <HI>Quomodo</HI>&mdash;how to procure the ways and means. I had never travelled much in <HI>England,</HI> and I thought it would be no bad thing
<PB N="13" REF="20">
to pay my per&s;onal re&s;pects to my old patrons, to thank them for their libera|lity, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;ent them with &s;uch an entertainment as &s;hould not only in&s;ure me their good wi&s;hes and intere&s;t them for my pro&s;perity, but &s;upply me with the means to accompli&s;h my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Determined however to make &s;ure of every thing in my power, I wrote to Mr. HARRIS, telling him my intention, and offering to &s;ale &s;uch materials as I conceived might be u&s;eful to him. I received a letter encouraging me to fur|ni&s;h him with pieces of any de&s;cription; and I have actually from that time to this, at my lei&s;ure, been hard at work for him.</P>
<P>But I know not how it is&mdash;my mind mi&s;gives me on this &s;ubject. I have &s;ince &s;een Mr. HARRIS at BRISTOL, and heard from him at YORK. However, I &s;hall anticipate nothing&mdash;all matters &s;hall come in their proper order&mdash;and, if you have the patience I wi&s;h you&mdash;for patience you mu&s;t have if you jog on with me through my TOUR&mdash;indeed, if I was to follow the examples of &s;ome mu&s;ical travellers, I &s;hould exerci&s;e no other virtue in you&mdash;you will permit me to place the banquet I have invited you to, in what manner I plea&s;e. In|tere&s;t forbid, having &s;uch work for my own imagination, I &s;hould not leave the reader as much room as po&s;&s;ible for the workings of his. It has been affirmed that the plea&s;ures we fancy, are completer than tho&s;e we enjoy; and, if this po&s;ition be founded, who knows but, by con&s;tantly keeping curio&s;ity on tiptoe, I &s;hall receive credit for having furni&s;hed a good fea&s;t, even though half the merit lay in exciting the appetite. There is more art, &s;ay the pain|ters, in concealing than &s;hewing. Would any one read an epigram if the la&s;t line were taken away? Not to gratify, would be to to make a TANTALUS of the reader; but &s;till let us remember that <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> ea&s;ily attained, is but another word for SATIETY.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not in the dull month of November, when Engli&s;hmen hang and drown them&s;elves, but in the &s;prightly month of March, when they rou&s;e from their lethargy, when citizens and tom-tits begin to in|hale the bracing influence of the ea&s;tern breeze, and ponies and country-lodg|ings are &s;martened up for cu&s;tomers. You who are perfectly, correctly, cri|tically erudite, will not &s;urely blame me for being particular as to dates. Some readers remember nothing but the chronological parts, and it does not &s;ignify three-pence by what means this Queen happened to be ravi&s;hed, or that Em|peror flayed alive, &s;o that they can give a faithful account of the time &s;uch an event took place. Mr. SHERIDAN marks the time in the commencement of his <HI>Duenna</HI> by making the clock &s;trike four, though he ridicules that very cir|cum&s;tance&mdash;forgetting of cour&s;e that he had u&s;ed it&mdash;in <HI>The Critic.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth of March, 1787, I left <HI>the regions of &s;moke</HI> for the <HI>regions of accompli&s;hment.</HI> Nothing pa&s;&s;ed on the road worthy your notice. The con|ver&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;tage-coach was in the u&s;ual &s;tile. Almo&s;t every object brought with it &s;ome remark. We admired, as u&s;ual, the entrance of <HI>Sion-Hou&s;e,</HI> the convenient &s;ituation for &s;tar-gazing of Mr. HERSCHEL&mdash;we
<PB N="16" REF="23">
&s;ighed, as u&s;ual, to think on human depravity, on contemplating the gibbets upon Houn&s;low-Heath; and we lamented their fate who were poi&s;oned at Salt-Hill. The very dinner was as u&s;ual&mdash;&s;ome &s;oup which might have been mi&s;|taken for a do&s;e of &s;alts reli&s;hed with leeks, and a boiled leg of mutton &s;carcely warmed through. At length the maje&s;tic view of lofty &s;teeples, towers, and turrets demanded our admiration&mdash;and we pre&s;ently arrived at Oxford.</P>
<P>The next morning I called on Dr. HAYES. If you have never &s;een this gentleman, I mu&s;t tell you that he is the very kind of man that of all others intere&s;ts you &s;trongly in his favour the moment you &s;peak to him. I believe no human creature ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a better or a more blamele&s;s heart, and never was a countenance more the index of a mind; for whatever fancy can picture of benevolence, mildne&s;s, and benignity, is written there, in characters &s;o le|gible that they cannot be mi&s;taken. If he &s;hould &s;ee this portrait of him&s;elf, and from his diffidence wi&s;h I had blotted it out, let him forgive me in the re|flection that I am only ambitious to do him that ju&s;tice which he has &s;o much plea&s;ure in rendering to all mankind. Nay&mdash;you &s;hall your&s;elf confe&s;s I am not a flattering painter. Can you tell me, my dear Sir, a character &s;o near perfection as he who, a profe&s;&s;or him&s;elf, knows not <HI>profe&s;&s;ional envy?</HI> This man then is Dr. HAYES&mdash;and he is &s;o very different from JOSEPH SURFACE, that all the world &s;peaks <HI>well of him,</HI> and yet all the world &s;peaks TRUTH.</P>
<P>After we had talked over my bu&s;ine&s;s, in the cour&s;e of which conver&s;a|tion I told him that I had a very &s;trong wi&s;h to &s;tart my entertainment at the Univer&s;ity, to give it a proper &s;anction, he referred me to THE VICE CHANCEL|LOR, and gave me an introductory letter. I a&s;ked him if Dr. CHAPMAN was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and he told me I &s;hould find him the mo&s;t chearful, amiable man I had ever conver&s;ed with. This report was &s;o true that I mu&s;t try my hand at another de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD is a tall, well-made man, with all the ea&s;y grace and native &s;implicity of a plain country gentleman&mdash;and yet a de|meanour that might &s;hame a courtier. His eye is &s;o piercing that it &s;eems to penetrate your very intentions&mdash;and yet &s;o mild that it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern his only &s;olicitation is to know your wants, and &s;upply them. His conver&s;ation is as &s;imple&mdash;yet as elegant as SWIFT's <HI>Drapier's Letters.</HI> His di&s;cernment re|markably acute; and his di&s;crimination preci&s;ion it&s;elf. This gentleman, if he &s;hould &s;o far honour me as to read this book, may wonder how I can venture to affirm &s;o much from the little opportunity I had of conver&s;ing with him; but I will be ingenuous enough to declare that I went to him pre-determined to make my ob&s;ervations&mdash;and tho&s;e ob&s;ervations went not more to any other part of his conduct, than his invincible integrity&mdash;of which as well as the re&s;t you &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t premi&s;e however, I would not declare what pa&s;&s;ed between us, could I for a moment &s;uppo&s;e it would create the mo&s;t di&s;tant chance of belief in the brea&s;t of any young gentlemen of the Univer&s;ity, that Dr. CHAPMAN is not as anxious to give them plea&s;ure as they to receive it. He certainly debarred them at that time of what they afterwards did me the kindne&s;s to con&s;ider as a very high gratification. I told him the nature of my entertainment, and his words were the&s;e: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am very &s;orry I mu&s;t refu&s;e you my con&s;ent. Your profe&s;&s;i|onal abilities de&s;erve a different an&s;wer; and I dare &s;ay you would perform nothing that could di&s;credit either your&s;elf or the Univer&s;ity&mdash;but I am, at this moment, particularly circum&s;tanced. There have been lately many riots; and though I am very de&s;irous of plea&s;ing the &s;tudents, they &s;ome|times put it out of my power. Here was a Mr. COLLINS, and I could not with propriety let him perform. He went away&mdash;and the young gentlemen took the matter &s;o much in dudgeon that they encouraged &s;ome Italians to &s;ing here, without my permi&s;&s;ion. I was in con&s;equence under the painful
<PB N="18" REF="25">
nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending them to pri&s;on;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The riotous conduct of the &s;tudents upon this occa&s;ion went &s;o far that one of them &s;truck the mayor, and it was expected at the time I was there that a &s;entence of expul&s;ion would pa&s;s again&s;t him at the end of the term.</NOTE> and it is more than probable, were I now to tell you&mdash;which I wi&s;h I could&mdash;Mr. DIBDIN you may perform your entertainment&mdash;they might think I &s;et you up again&s;t their favourite Italians, and it might turn out a &s;erious quarrel&mdash;for, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, your profe&s;&s;ional reputation would be of no avail&mdash;and they would re&s;ent in their anger what in a cooler moment they might be convinced they had rea&s;on to thank me for."</Q></P>
<P>Nothing could be hand&s;omer than this rea&s;oning. I felt my&s;elf &s;o influ|enced by it that I was more plea&s;ed at &s;uch a refu&s;al than I &s;hould have been by an unconditional permi&s;&s;ion. This gentleman took a great deal of pains to prove him&s;elf right in a matter wherein, had he been &s;o minded, he had no|thing to exerci&s;e but an <HI>ip&s;e dixit.</HI> The di&s;charge of his duty as <HI>vice chancellor</HI> did not &s;atisfy him&mdash;he cho&s;e to di&s;charge it as <HI>a man.</HI> In fine, as he &s;aw no|thing that he could di&s;approve in the nature of my entertainment, he could not bear that I &s;hould come to Oxford for nothing; and thinking very probably that his apparent refu&s;al might be of public di&s;advantage to me, he gave me his word that I &s;hould perform my amu&s;ement in the following term. Thus I took leave of Dr. CHAPMAN, a character, were it more imitated by the <HI>clergy,</HI> religion would be more revered by the <HI>laity.</HI></P>
<P>To prove however that I have no further intere&s;t in what I have &s;aid above, than that fair and candid ju&s;tice I am determined to do every man I mention in this &s;eries of letters, I declare I did not put ten guineas in my pocket by my performance at OXFORD, on my return&mdash;and I neglected what would have been a con&s;iderably greater advantage to me. I can therefore have no other rea&s;on for what I here advance, than a regard for truth, unbia&s;&s;ed by any &s;er|vile

motive; and as that &s;hall hone&s;tly actuate me upon all occa&s;ions, you will by and by get the portrait of another vice chancellor who had his <HI>motives</HI> for refu&s;ing me too&mdash;but they were not exactly of the &s;ame complexion as Dr. CHAPMAN's.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday, March 20, I arrived at that mixture of lowline&s;s and grandeur, pride and meanne&s;s, politene&s;s and impertinence&mdash;BATH&mdash;the region of fa&s;hion and dullne&s;s&mdash;of elegance and vapidity&mdash;of public reputation and private intrigue&mdash;of extravagance and impo&s;ition. Where dre&s;s is the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of all virtue&mdash;where a graceful minuet is con&s;idered as the height of human perfection&mdash;where good-breeding is carried to &s;uch a pitch of refinement that doves and rooks mix <HI>&s;ans fa&ccedil;on,</HI> and the foxes and gee&s;e are all of one family&mdash;where the buildings, like the vi&s;itors, are grand, heavy, and &s;moke-dried&mdash;where Iri&s;h gentlemen of high families and low fortunes lay in wait for opportunities to amu&s;e tho&s;e mi&s;&s;es who pa&s;s their whole time in con|triving how they &s;hall mo&s;t conveniently leave &s;ick mamma to the care of the old nur&s;e&mdash;and where convivial lords who have worn out the cellar, the larder, the waiters, and them&s;elves in London, are wheeled down, with about &s;ix months to live, to drink the waters, hobble cotillions, pick their teeth, qualify Burgundy with &s;pruce beer, faintly revive expiring nature by the admini&s;tration of &s;timulatives, beat fal&s;e time, &s;cream bravo, <HI>mal apropos,</HI> and hiccup out <HI>non nobis domine.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Tue&s;day, the twenty-&s;econd, at noon, I made my public appearance&mdash;if performing an entertainment before eight and thirty per&s;ons can be called &s;o&mdash;for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time during twelve years; and, if I had not a per&s;everance beyond any other man, it would have been my <HI>la&s;t.</HI> Hea|ven defend me from &s;uch a &s;et of in&s;ipid, vague, unmeaning, countenances. One of the number I have &s;ince performed before at MONMOUTH, and another at WAKEFIELD, both of whom in&s;i&s;ted upon it that the performance was much better than at BATH&mdash;when the fact was they were only in company more di&s;|po&s;ed to be happy. All tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which to your knowledge have kept the audience in a roar, were received with a vacant gravity, an unfeeling &s;tare, a milk and water indifference. Enough, as I &s;ay of my poet, to make a man for&s;wear ever taking a pen in his hand&mdash;yet; I found afterwards that they were all plea&s;ed&mdash;it was only their manner of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves. It was BATH, and therefore it would have been vulgar to laugh or give way to any emotion that indicates plea&s;ure &s;uch as the heart participates. This I had occa|&s;ion
<PB N="25" REF="32">
more minutely to remark by paying a vi&s;it to the catch-club&mdash;where even the gla&s;s, which never circulated more freely&mdash;nor all the toa&s;ts that accompa|nied it&mdash;the &s;ongs that relieved it, which were pretty well fraught with that reproachful &s;ub&s;titute for humour that men who are &s;trangers to real wit find &s;o much plea&s;ure in, could &s;carcely rai&s;e a &s;mile&mdash;the broad bottoms of the gla&s;&s;es, as if in&s;tinctively, re&s;ounded a peal of applau&s;e at the end of every &s;ong, but till the end of the next, all was &s;ilent as death. I note this as an in&s;tance of fa&s;hionable gravity, beyond credibility&mdash;for, that a meeting, profe&s;&s;edly convivial &s;hould apparently be held without mirth, is a kind of exi&s;tence without a &s;oul&mdash;a mental death&mdash;but it may be reconciled by &s;aying that it is a refinement on politene&s;s, re&s;erved alone to grace the luke-warm court of the luke-warm KING BLADUD.</P>
<P>As the&s;e remarks on the affected &s;tupidity of the BATH auditors natu|rally lead to audiences in general, I &s;hall, while I am on the &s;ubject, &s;peak a little of the different feelings of different &s;pectators. Some have been in rap|tures about nothing&mdash;others have applauded without di&s;crimination&mdash;&s;ome have intruded their opinions on every body, and others have not dared to feel till they had a&s;ked the opinions of their neighbours. But it is not BATH alone&mdash;every &s;eparate place I have &s;een has its peculiar mode of indicating its plea|&s;ure. You may remember, in a letter written to me &s;ome time ago, you wondered at my adverti&s;ing my entertainment at BIRMINGHAM, when it was notorious that at one of the meetings, where <HI>L'Allegro il ed Pen&s;oro&s;o</HI> was per|formed, the audience was unmoved at every part of it but the line
<Q>"Drew iron tears down PLUTO's cheeks"</Q></P>
<P>At BRISTOL&mdash;which place, to a proverb, is remarkable for hoggi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;they did not con&s;ider &s;o much the quality as when they had enough&mdash;and &s;o of the re&s;t&mdash;the particulars of which local ta&s;te will come in their place. I cannot, however, refrain from noticing the delight that <HI>Grog</HI> has given all

I &s;hall conclude this letter with an anecdote of GARRICK and old CERVETTO.</P>
<P>When GARRICK returned from ITALY, he prepared an addre&s;s to the au|dience, which he delivered previous to the play he fir&s;t appeared in. When he came upon the &s;tage, he was welcomed with three loud plaudits, each fini&s;h|ing with a huzza. As &s;oon as this unprecedented applau&s;e had a little &s;ub&s;ided, he u&s;ed every art of which he was &s;o completely ma&s;ter to lull the tumult into a profound &s;ilence&mdash;and, ju&s;t as all was hu&s;hed as death, and anxious expec|tation &s;at on every face, old CERVETTO, who was better known by the name of NOSEY, anticipated the very fir&s;t line of the addre&s;s by&mdash;aw&mdash;a tremendous yawn. A convul&s;ion of laughter en&s;ued, and it was &s;ome minutes before the wi&s;hed-for &s;ilence could be again re&s;tored. That, however, obtained&mdash;GAR|RICK delivered his addre&s;s in that happy, irre&s;i&s;tible manner in which he was always &s;ure to captivate his audience; and he retired with applau&s;e &s;uch as was never better given, nor ever de&s;erved. But the matter did not re&s;t here&mdash;The moment he came off the &s;tage, he flew like lightening to the mu&s;ic room, where, collaring a&s;toni&s;hed NOSEY, he began to abu&s;e him pretty vociferou&s;ly. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Wha&mdash;why&mdash;you old &s;coundrel&mdash;you mu&s;t be the mo&s;t infernal'</Q>&mdash;at length poor CERVETTO&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh!

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had &s;carcely returned home after my fir&s;t perfor|mance at BATH, when two ladies knocked at my parlour door. They were u&s;hered in; and, having thanked me for my entertainment, and profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves extremely &s;orry that I had been &s;o thinly attended, they proceeded to a&s;&s;ure me that as apparently I was a &s;tranger to the mode of conducting an amu&s;ement at BATH, they, who were leaders of fa&s;hionable matters, could not refrain from calling to &s;et me right concerning &s;ome particulars, and offer me &s;uch advice as might be condu&s;ive to my intere&s;t. After a good deal of conver&s;ation, it was agreed that I &s;hould &s;u&s;pend the performance, to give them an opportunity of enquiring when a repetition of it would be mo&s;t agreeable to the company then in the town. The&s;e preliminaries adju&s;ted, they went away; and one of the&s;e ladies actually took the trouble of advi&s;|ing me, by letter, of what &s;he had learnt, and a time was at length appointed which would, according to her advice, procure me a full audience. The morning came, and I had the honour of meeting only <HI>&s;ixteen per&s;ons</HI>; but what mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed me was, that my <HI>two patrone&s;&s;es</HI> did not appear among the number. It immediately &s;truck me that they had played me the <HI>&s;econd part</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="36">
of the <HI>&s;ame tune</HI> through which I had been &s;o completely <HI>hummed</HI> by the <HI>Iri&s;h Jolmon.</HI> But why?&mdash;wherefore?&mdash;from what motive? They wanted no &s;ong &s;et to mu&s;ic; and yet there mu&s;t be &s;omething in the wind, or el&s;e why call on me and write letters? Not to tire you about &s;uch a &s;tupid bu&s;ine&s;s. I at la&s;t learnt for a certainty that they were &s;upporters of the <HI>Old Rooms,</HI> and had taken every po&s;&s;ible pains to decry the entertainment&mdash;to repre&s;ent me as an impo&s;tor&mdash;and appoint a time when nobody would attend&mdash;not becau&s;e they had the &s;malle&s;t objection to me, but&mdash;becau&s;e I performed at the <HI>New Rooms.</HI> Thus, at BATH, I fell a &s;acrifice to a &s;tupid caprice in which I had not the &s;malle&s;t concern.</P>
<P>At length my eyes were opened by Mr. DERHAM, the ma&s;ter of the <HI>New Rooms,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured me it would be the height of folly to attempt another per|formance. I clo&s;ed with him in opinion, and offered the money I had agreed to pay for the rooms, which he refu&s;ed with the&s;e words&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. DIBDIN, how|ever you may have been treated by others in BATH, you &s;hall meet with no|thing illiberal from me. I have no &s;ort of objection to getting money, but I never yet got any <HI>dirty</HI> money&mdash;and I am &s;ure I will not begin now. If you think I have done you any kindne&s;s, the only return I require is, to hear of your pro&s;perity, which I &s;incerely wi&s;h and &s;hould be happy to promote.'</Q> I &s;hall make no comment on this kind conduct of Mr. DERHAM, his dome&s;tic and general character is too well known to need my panegyrick; and I am &s;ure, though my regard to ju&s;tice would not permit me to do &s;o, I &s;hould have better plea&s;ed him, had I been totally &s;ilent on this head.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters pa&s;&s;ed at that notorious moment when the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. TWYCROSS's E O tables engro&s;&s;ed all the conver&s;ation of the place&mdash;when the dove-hou&s;e exulted and the rookery &s;hook to its foundation. That building however I am afraid is erected upon too permanent a footing to be overturned &s;o ea&s;ily. Tho&s;e are temporary convul&s;ions, and only &s;erve to di&s;cover the damaged parts that <HI>at a proper expence</HI> they may be the more &s;ecurely &s;topped.
<PB N="30" REF="37">
At this time&mdash;for things fall out generally pretty <HI>apropos</HI> with me&mdash;I received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. DALY's agent, who happened to be at BATH to engage a performer.</P>
<P>You may remember, in Letter IV, I mention an engagement I had made with Mr. DALY, and this is a proper place to go into the particulars of it. To do &s;o I mu&s;t &s;tate the &s;ub&s;tance of a hand-bill I was compelled to publi&s;h in the month of February la&s;t. It mentioned that I had entered into an article, under a penalty of 200l. with Mr. DALY, for three years, to furni&s;h certain pieces and certain mu&s;ic for the Iri&s;h theatre; that Mr. DALY had broken this arti|cle in three &s;everal in&s;tances, two of which I had overlooked, and was willing to qualify the third, if Mr. DALY would let the whole matter go to a reference. This&mdash;being then in England&mdash;he &s;eemed to con&s;ent to. A gentleman on each part was appointed; but as it was evident his friend was too clo&s;ely connected with his intere&s;t (being afterwards his agent, and indeed the very gentleman who &s;ent to me at BATH, as above) my appointed referee, &s;eeing all this, wi&s;hed to have an umpire. The bu&s;ine&s;s was however trifled with. Mr. DALY would not &s;ign the bond of arbitration; and in &s;hort nothing had been done when my friend was obliged to leave town, and Mr. DALY on the eve of his departure for Ireland. In this &s;ituation I was determined to bring him to rea&s;on; and for that purpo&s;e commenced an action again&s;t him&mdash;but re&s;olving to treat him with every kind of delicacy, I would not &s;uffer it to be &s;erved. This he was informed of by my attorney, to whom he acknowledged that I had treated him &s;o hand&s;omely, and with &s;o much lenity, that he engaged his <HI>word</HI> and HO|NOUR not to leave England till I &s;hould be fully and fairly &s;atisfied. He thought proper however to forfeit his promi&s;e, and my friends urged me to publi&s;h an account of the matter, as a warning to others.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;tood over from February till the above me&s;&s;age. I met the gentleman, and after a fruitle&s;s attempt to obtain my due, fearing that &s;ome trick might be played me&mdash;as the article was not at that moment cancelled&mdash;I
<PB N="31" REF="38">
agreed to receive <HI>forty pounds</HI> for TWO HUNDRED, and exchange general relea&s;es, &s;o charmed was I to get rid of &s;o &s;candalous a bu&s;ine&s;s; and as it was repre|&s;ented to me that much inconvenience might accrue to Mr. DALY from the above hand-bill, which &s;till &s;tood out again&s;t him uncontradicted, I voluntarily offered to give a declaration under my hand that I was &s;atisfied with the conclu|&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e matters premi&s;ed, the proper writings were put in hand I received <HI>thirty pounds</HI> in CASH, a note at two months of <HI>ten pounds,</HI> and a promi&s;e <HI>in writing</HI> that the pieces of mine then in Mr. DALY's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould be delivered into the hands of a friend <HI>as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI> Had the&s;e pro|mi&s;es been fulfilled I &s;hould have conceived my&s;elf prohibited by my written declaration from publi&s;hing this tran&s;action&mdash;but as in TEN months, in&s;tead of <HI>two,</HI> the payment is not made, nor the pieces returned, I look upon the au|thority I gave to &s;ay I was &s;atisfied in the light of a defea&s;ance on the back of a warrant of attorney, which is done away if the conditions annexed to it are not literally complied with&mdash;the bond therefore, as far as it relates to Mr. DALY's having behaved unhand&s;ome and di&s;honourable, remains yet in <HI>full force</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> and if any per&s;ons after this chu&s;e to engage with Mr. DALY, without a proper &s;ecurity, I think a &s;tatute of lunacy might be taken out again&s;t them without much impropriety.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be wanting to my&s;elf and common ju&s;tice, if I did not &s;ay, before I quit the &s;ubject of BATH, that with particular plea&s;ure I &s;aw my old friend KEASBURY, with whom, twenty years ago, I have heard <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the chimes at mid|night."</Q> He was well and happy, and may he long continue &s;o! Nor mu&s;t I omit that I witne&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t re&s;pectable performance at his theatre. The farce, which was Mr. SHERIDAN's <HI>St. Patrick's Day,</HI> was acted infinitely bet|ter than ever I &s;aw it in London. Indeed this is one excellent property of a <HI>regular</HI> company in the country, the minuter parts&mdash;which a town actor thinks &s;o little of, and which by the bye are remarkably material, witne&s;s GARRICK's attention to them&mdash;are paid much more re&s;pect to; but however this applies more immediately to BATH, where my old friend's veteran judgment and gen|tlemanly

deportment will always in&s;ure from the performers a proper re&s;pect and attention. But le&s;t it &s;hould be thought that I am applying the motto at the head of this letter to any intere&s;ted purpo&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you I only wi&s;h it to tell again&s;t the ladies and the Iri&s;h manager; for I aver with the true&s;t &s;incerity, that I de&s;ire no favour at Mr. KEASBURY's hands, and only wi&s;h I may &s;ee him alive and hearty many years to come, and that &s;o far from <HI>wheedling</HI> you, I mean nothing but truth when I a&s;&s;ure you that I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS indi&s;pen&s;ably incumbent on me to &s;ay &s;ome|thing concerning the manners, mu&s;ical ta&s;te, &amp;c. of the inhabitants of all tho&s;e places in which I have been, or may yet pa&s;s through. This however I &s;hall not be even tolerably qualified to do, till I come to where I re|turned to Cambridge, having before that time made no re&s;olution to publi&s;h my TOUR, and therefore of cour&s;e many matters which I have &s;ince trea&s;ured were almo&s;t forgotten as &s;oon as pa&s;&s;ed. Indeed I do not conceive it at all my province to point out market-days, fairs, wakes, and &s;tatutes, the number of inhabitants, or talk of corporations, charters, grants, and privileges, unle&s;s in|deed it &s;hould &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary for the illu&s;tration and e&s;tabli&s;hment of any particular fact which common opinion has gros&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented. Thus, I will not call BRISTOL the &s;econd town in England, in point of the number of inhabitants, when I am &s;ure SHEFFIELD contains as many&mdash;and I believe MAN|CHESTER, but certainly LIVERPOOL double the number. I &s;hall however give &s;uch cur&s;ory hints as I have promi&s;ed in my fir&s;t letter. At pre&s;ent I have not quite done with BATH&mdash;which, as a city, is like a Frenchman's &s;hirt&mdash;the ruffle is very fine, but the body very coar&s;e. Place a man in his &s;leep in the Cre&s;cent, and he might upon waking conceive him&s;elf in an amphitheatre,
<PB N="34" REF="41">
erected by the &s;ame workmen who built the Temple of Solomon; but in&s;tead of this, place him in one of tho&s;e blind alleys&mdash;for there are no other commu|nications&mdash;which &s;eparate the old town from the new, and fancying him&s;elf in Field-lane or St. Giles's, he would immediately &s;earch for his pocket hand|kerchief. In &s;hort, as I ob&s;erved before, all is either &s;plendidly dull or dirtily vulgar.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WOULD one think it po&s;&s;ible that a di&s;tance of only twelve miles &s;hould make &s;uch a difference in manners, as to pre&s;ent you with two di&s;tinct &s;pecies of human beings? At BATH every thing is <HI>&s;uperfi|cial</HI>&mdash;at BRISTOL every thing <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial.</HI> At BATH every thing <HI>gay</HI>&mdash;at BRIS|TOL every thing <HI>grave.</HI> In BATH they live in <HI>fine hou&s;es,</HI> and are <HI>poor</HI>&mdash;in BRISTOL in <HI>&s;habby ones,</HI> and are rich. At <HI>carele&s;s</HI> BATH nothing is thought of but the <HI>pre&s;ent moment</HI>&mdash;at <HI>provident</HI> BRISTOL no &s;tep is taken but with a view to the advantage of <HI>po&s;terity.</HI> In &s;hort they are both actuated by an equal, though different &s;pecies of folly; for, one flies off from the rea&s;onable part of human pur&s;uits, and &s;eeks for plea&s;ures that have no place but in the imagination, like a volatile body which leaves the earth and lo&s;es it&s;elf in &s;pace, while the other is buried in the muck and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, till the wearied appetite is &s;unk in gorged &s;atiety, without capacity to know di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>On my arrival at BRISTOL, which was on Monday in the pa&s;&s;ion week, the fir&s;t objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves, when I alighted from the coach,
<PB N="36" REF="43">
were three living turtles, lying on their backs. This circum&s;tance &s;oon pro|duced me an account from the WAITER, that, on the following week, the DUKE OF PORTLAND was expected there, with a large body of the minority; and that &s;hips had been di&s;patched to fetch good cheer on the joyful occa&s;ion. Their only fear, it &s;eems, was, that as his GRACE laboured under an indi&s;po|&s;ition, and was obliged to eat by pre&s;cription, he could not be able to cut any capital figure at the noble exerci&s;e of the knife and fork. Mr. Fox, Mr. SHE|RIDAN, and their facetious colleague Capt. MORRIS, who it was reported was hired on purpo&s;e to abu&s;e the mini&s;ters in a new &s;ong &s;et to an old tune, were however expected to fill up the principal parts in the gormandizing concert, which was to fini&s;h with a capital duetto between burgundy and di&s;affection. But &s;o fallacious are the hopes, and precarious the expectation of turtle-eaters, as well as all other &s;ublunary beings, that the&s;e glorious pro&s;pects vani&s;hed like a dream, for the DUKE OF PORTLAND came almo&s;t alone&mdash;no one adherent of con&s;equence having accompanied him but LORD STORMONT, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion in no way leaning from the line of a perfect gentleman, and a true bred man of fa&s;hion, the poor dear BRISTOL MEN felt awkwardly throughout the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and were even, &s;ome &s;ay, heard to groan when they pre&s;ented the DUKE&mdash;not with his <HI>freedom,</HI> for that co&s;t nothing.&mdash;but with the <HI>gold box</HI> and <HI>five pounds a year</HI>&mdash;for, though this la&s;t was not &s;terling, yet a promi&s;e with a merchant is the &s;ame as money&mdash;the &s;alary annexed to the high office to which they did his GRACE the honour to call him.</P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;&s;ion week</HI> being ob&s;erved in BRISTOL with great exactne&s;s, by way of balance in hand, to an&s;wer the expected di&s;bur&s;ements during the fea&s;ts after <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> nothing like amu&s;ements could be thought of. In the <HI>Ea&s;ter week</HI> every moment was appropriated to the DUKE OF PORTLAND, therefore, of cour&s;e, I could not get my entertainment in edge ways. On the week follow|ing, when I did perform it, and heaven knows to very little purpo&s;e, the con&s;tant cry was&mdash;that &s;o much <HI>more</HI> money had been expended on the above occa&s;ion than was expected, that they were obliged to pull up a little&mdash;but if
<PB N="37" REF="44">
I would &s;tay a fortnight longer, and perform upon more rea&s;onable terms, there could be no doubt but I &s;hould find it worth my while. Never having been fond of any thing &s;o rigidly methodical, and fearing it would not an&s;wer my purpo&s;e&mdash;the con&s;tant maxim of a BRISTOL MAN being to take care that no|body &s;hall <HI>get any thing by him</HI>&mdash;I gave the matter up, and devoted the re|mainder of my time to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>re&s;t</HI>&mdash;for the fir&s;t time I had ever &s;een any thing written by Mrs. INCHBALD&mdash;I attended at the performance of <HI>Such Things are,</HI> and <HI>The Widow's Vow</HI>&mdash;the fir&s;t of which I &s;hould have known belonged to a lady if it had been only for <HI>the wig,</HI> which I will venture to &s;ay outdoes every thing in Mrs. BEHN's <HI>Rover.</HI> The parts were many of them incomparably well played. I never &s;aw Mr. LEWIS in <HI>Twineall,</HI> but I &s;hould think nothing could &s;urpa&s;s BERNARD in that character. Mr. DIAMOND was very correct and able in <HI>Ha&s;well</HI>&mdash;and, indeed, where there would otherwi&s;e have been any defi|ciency, perfectne&s;s and good di&s;cipline gave the whole an air of re&s;pectability which I could wi&s;h to &s;ee imitated on a LONDON Theatre&mdash;where, frequently, in a game of romps, the author is kicked and buffetted about in a mo&s;t un|merciful manner. In the&s;e particulars, my old, valuable friend JEFFERSON&mdash;who, hearing I was at BRISTOL, came from BATH on purpo&s;e to &s;ee me&mdash;perfectly agreed with me. What can be the rea&s;on JEFFERSON is not engaged in TOWN? This que&s;tion I did not a&s;k him, but it has twenty times occurred to me. Surely the man whom GARRICK took delight to perform with cannot but be an object to the <HI>Theatre.</HI> He was con&s;tantly, as every body knows, the <HI>Colonel Briton</HI> to his <HI>Dox Felix</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Claudio</HI> to his <HI>Benedict</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Aimwell</HI> to his <HI>Archer</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Frederick</HI> to his <HI>Don John</HI>&mdash;and I could name many other &s;imilar in&s;tances&mdash;nay, when he left off walking as <HI>Benedick</HI> in the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> he cho&s;e JEFFERSON as the only per&s;on that could repre&s;ent him. JEFFERSON is like GARRICK in the face, and he gives you a &s;trong idea of him altogether, only larger. Nor let it be &s;aid that GARRICK u&s;ed him <HI>as a &s;oil.</HI> It is well known at the <HI>Theatre</HI> that GARRICK was particularly careful to have tho&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="45">
plays well got up in which he appeared him&s;elf. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions he had recour&s;e, wherever he could, to JEFFERSON, PARSONS, WESTON, and DODD. Did not then GARRICK's judgment rank JEFFERSON re&s;pectably? It is true he &s;hrunk a little from the very fir&s;t-rate abilities. He would never couple with BARRY in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and very reluctantly indeed with KING in <HI>Comedy</HI>&mdash;and, if the common cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s made it indi&s;pen&s;ible&mdash;for where is there a play in which KING has not &s;ucce&s;sfully performed?&mdash;you will always &s;ee that the two characters wear &s;o very different a complexion that no auditor can draw a comparative view of their merits. And here I cannot refrain from noticing, that there was no man whom Mr. GARRICK openly care&s;&s;ed and &s;e|cretly hated &s;o much as Mr. KING.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I'll bring this fact home to Mr. KING's recollection. Mr. GARRICK prepared a pro&s;e Dialogue, which was &s;poken by him&s;elf and that gentleman at the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> immediately after the <HI>Ode</HI>&mdash;a time when there was not the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of receiving attention to any thing. But this was not enough&mdash;What part did Mr. KING act? Why, truly, in the place where about twelve hundred people were in enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration of SHAKESPEARE, he was to find out a thou&s;and faults in his writing. Nor was this ungrateful ta&s;k fairly &s;et about&mdash;for, written by Mr. GARRICK, the objections were all pretended&mdash;the better to &s;hew his defence of the poet, by way of an&s;wer.</NOTE> I know this fact, or I would not a&s;&s;ert it; and I believe it may be ea&s;ily reconciled, when we con&s;ider that Mr. KING, added to his uncommon merit as a performer, is an <HI>independent man.</HI> Yet, with all his faults, &s;hould the memory of GARRICK be revered. I have an en|thu&s;ia&s;tic reverence for his merit as a performer&mdash;and, as JEFFERSON was at lea&s;t his faithful and approved companion in his theatrical career, let us no more neglect him when we think of GARRICK, than we would <HI>Pylades, Achates,</HI> and <HI>Patrocles,</HI> when we think of <HI>Ore&s;tes, Aeneas,</HI> or <HI>Achilles.</HI> Perhaps, how|ever, as my intere&s;t at the <HI>Theatre</HI> is not very &s;trong, I had better have let alone this recommendation of my friend&mdash;but it cannot, at any rate, injure him with the world&mdash;and as his ideas at lea&s;t, like mine, are independent, he mu&s;t content him&s;elf&mdash;for no man, through the wonderful &s;erenity of his di&s;|po&s;ition, is more ea&s;ily contented&mdash;with being <HI>re&s;pected,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>affluent.</HI></P>
<P>My opinion, however, of my theatrical influence was &s;omewhat different at the time I mention&mdash;for, on that morning, I met Mr. HARRIS, who was,
<PB N="39" REF="46">
for the benefit of his health, at the <HI>Hot Wells.</HI> This gentleman &s;o corrobo|rated the contents of the letter I formerly mentioned, that, during the play, I took mea&s;ure of BERNARD and BLANCHARD&mdash;and they may remember I told them &s;o&mdash;for tho&s;e parts I intended to introduce for them in a <HI>new Opera,</HI> which has been long &s;ince fini&s;hed, but I fear will never be performed.</P>
<P>In this letter you &s;ee I have &s;tuck clo&s;e to my motto&mdash;for whether men perform the farce of greatne&s;s, zeal, fa&s;hion, or gormandizing, in real life, or on the &s;tage, as FOOTE &s;ays <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the purpo&s;e is the &s;ame, and the place im|material."</Q> As I have not, in the writing of tho&s;e letter, a &s;ingle document to con&s;ult but my memory, how naturally have the greate&s;t part of my quo|tations been from SHAKESPEARE! VOLTAIRE, meaning to abu&s;e him, pays that wonderful poet a mo&s;t elegant compliment. He &s;ays <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Engli&s;h, becau&s;e they find in SHAKESPEARE many pa&s;&s;ages fraught &s;o &s;trongly with force and nature that they get them by heart <HI>in &s;pite of them&s;elves,</HI> think him a great writer."</Q> If they wanted a better proof, I am &s;ure it was not in Mr. VOLTAIRE's power to give it them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS &s;o many procra&s;tinations threw &s;ome time on my hands, I improved it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by cultivating the friend&s;hip of a gentleman who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional abilities and private virtues endear him to all who have the plea&s;ure of his acquaintance. A better proof, I think, of his <HI>private worth</HI> need not be given than that he pa&s;&s;es from eight to twelve hours, out of twenty-four, in fagging at teaching, that mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all drudgery, and the remainder cheri&s;hing his wife and improving his children. Nor need I hold him up better as a model of <HI>profe&s;&s;ional excellence</HI> than by remarking that he has genius, judgment, ta&s;te, and, what is better, good &s;en&s;e to regu|late them. His compo&s;itions, which are many of them models for harp&s;ichord mu&s;ic, never &s;ink to mediocrity, and often ri&s;e to perfection. He has not the folly to &s;ub&s;titute ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s for nature, but contents him&s;elf with <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;urpri&s;ing.</HI> As a performer, he &s;hall take any man's &s;tile, and excel him&mdash;and I will demon&s;trate it in a moment. Fir&s;t, there is no pa&s;&s;age ever &s;o difficult but he can execute&mdash;and what no other player I ever heard could attain&mdash;I mean keeping regular time&mdash;he has in the highe&s;t perfection; for, let the pa&s;&s;age be ever &s;o rapid or interwoven, a child, with an ear, may as ea&s;ily mark the accented parts as of the mo&s;t familiar tune. I beg, however, I may be under&s;tood to mean that my friend is no conjurer, nor performer
<PB N="41" REF="48">
of impo&s;&s;ibilities&mdash;for three-fourths of harp&s;ichord mu&s;ic have neither plan nor motive, nor indeed any drift but difficulty&mdash;in particular tho&s;e unmean|ing, &s;en&s;ele&s;s rhap&s;odies in mu&s;ic that, were they executed by APOLLO, would have no better effect than a Dutch concert. For the &s;ake of &s;implicity, that beautiful ground-work of all &s;ublimity, I hope I am under&s;tood&mdash;and yet, is not that hope, like many of mine fruitle&s;s? I &s;hall make my&s;elf clear, however, by &s;aying there are two po&s;itions in mu&s;ic, which common &s;en&s;e &s;ays mu&s;t ever be kept &s;eparate and apart. The&s;e are the different di&s;tinctions of time&mdash;one is to count <HI>four,</HI> and the other <HI>three.</HI> Yet, the mu&s;ic-mongers&mdash;again&s;t common &s;en&s;e&mdash;with no other remedy for their imbecility than ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s&mdash;no other &s;ub&s;titute for their &s;terile and unprofitable imaginations than extrane|ou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;pretend to make one hand play four and the other three <HI>in</HI> and <HI>at</HI> the SAME TIME. Cannot the mo&s;t common under&s;tanding, without the &s;malle&s;t knowledge of mu&s;ic, &s;ee, in one moment, that this is an impo&s;&s;ibility? If you &s;hould go to BRISTOL, call on Mr. BOYTON&mdash;the gentleman to whom I have alluded above&mdash;and he will, for my &s;ake, be glad to &s;ee you&mdash;unle&s;s he &s;hould be offended&mdash;which I entreat he will not&mdash;at my endeavouring to do him a piece of ju&s;tice, which he will think more than he de&s;erves, though I well know my utmo&s;t prai&s;e is inadequate to his merit. The &s;ubject of this letter has given me &s;o much plea&s;ure, that I will not mix it with other matter. I cannot flatter&mdash;but 'tis like winning ones own heart to &s;peak the prai&s;es of the de&s;erving. 'Tis hard you will not write to me&mdash;yet, were you never more to do &s;o, I could not cea&s;e to be,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>I have ever conceived it the utmo&s;t height of extrava|gant folly to deal with even the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in any appeal to the public. The truth is &s;o ea&s;ily told&mdash;and, be&s;ides, it brings with it &s;uch a &s;aving of trouble, art, and duplicity&mdash;all which are mighty di&s;agreeable things&mdash;that&mdash;exclu&s;ive of the comfortable conviction that a man's argument cannot fairly be controverted&mdash;'tis in every other way his intere&s;t to keep that hone&s;t, manly monitor in view. Thus, to give fairly up the mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance of double dealing, I &s;hall addre&s;s no more letters to T. S. E&s;q.&mdash;Not that I have altered my &s;entiments in any re&s;pect relative to that gentleman&mdash;I know his admirable talents, nice di&s;cernment, and correct judgment&mdash;I know the&s;e letters would have been greatly benefitted by his remarks&mdash;I know his erudition is profound, his ta&s;te elegant, and his &s;tile beautiful. Nor do I at this moment believe he has altered his opinion in relation to me; and, as one &s;trong proof of if&mdash;though I confe&s;s I have yet received no an&s;wer to my <HI>&s;econd</HI> letter, which introduced the <HI>five</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ones, as will be &s;een by comparing their dates&mdash;he very lately told a particular friend of mine that my <HI>&s;even</HI> fir&s;t letters&mdash;I u&s;e his own words&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are wonderfully well written."</Q> The fact is, I hope to leave England by the beginning of April, and chance having thrown

this gentleman and I &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, were I to wait for an|&s;wers re&s;pectively to my letters, it would now be morally impo&s;&s;ible for this publication to come out till I had lo&s;t the INDIA &s;ea&s;on. I therefore&mdash;as I have frequently done, and I never repented it&mdash;throw my&s;elf upon the candour of the Public; not, however, in the paltry manner in which their indulgence is too frequently &s;olicited on the &s;tage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my mind a whim&s;ical anecdote, which I cannot avoid giving a place. TOMMY HULL, who is well known to have been the <HI>apologi&s;t-general</HI> at <HI>Covent Garden Theatre</HI> for about five and twenty years, took it into his head at the time of the di&s;pute between KEPPEL and PALLISER, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h him&s;elf as a <HI>lad of liberty.</HI> On the night when all LONDON was illuminated on KEPPEL's acquittal, he undertook, not only to light up his tenement in <HI>Martlet-court, Bow-&s;treet,</HI> but treat the populace with <HI>&s;mall beer.</HI> They had drank all but one barrel, which out of wantonne&s;s&mdash;becau&s;e it was rather &s;tale&mdash;they left running. The door was now &s;hut, le&s;t &s;ome of the <HI>liberty boys</HI> &s;hould take a fancy to the <HI>&s;ilver &s;poons.</HI> At this they grew clamourous, and bawled out very outrageou&s;ly for <HI>more beer.</HI> TOMMY&mdash;as was his cu&s;tom&mdash;thinking it high time he &s;hould now make his appearance&mdash;popped his red night-capped head out of the window, and there was immediately a cry of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hear him&mdash;hear him."</Q> When he thus began:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ladies and gentlemen, I have the misfortune to tell you&mdash;that the &s;piggot is out of the fau&s;et, and the &s;mall beer is run about the cellar&mdash;<HI>and we humbly hope for</HI>&mdash;YOUR USUAL INDULGENCE.</Q></NOTE>&mdash;but, backed with an a&s;&s;urance that, though the front of my army cannot come up, yet I am winged with particular literary friends, and well flanked with ca&s;ual ones; add to which, I have &s;e|veral out-po&s;ts&mdash;well &s;ituated&mdash;of well-wi&s;hers, and an admirable <HI>corps de re&s;erve</HI> of&mdash;<HI>the lovers of mu&s;ic</HI>; nor am I yet without hope that I &s;hall derive &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the main body. Thus, when all my forces are mu&s;tered together, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall not fail of a complete victory over my enemies, whom I &s;hall deliver up to the public to be <HI>admoni&s;hed</HI> and FORGIVEN.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, when he &s;wore an oath, would &s;ay&mdash;God forgive me&mdash;which he called rubbing out as he went. Thus&mdash;by way of clearing my ground, or, as the &s;ailors call it, bringing up lee-way&mdash;I &s;hall make this letter one entire digre&s;&s;ion, into which I &s;hall collect all extraneous matter. And, fir&s;t&mdash;being <HI>figuratively</HI> at one place and <HI>literally</HI> at another&mdash;it may be a&s;ked why I did not &s;et down tho&s;e tran&s;actions I celebrate at the time they hap|pened. I have already &s;aid that at my fir&s;t &s;etting out I had not the &s;malle&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="51">
idea of writing any account of my TOUR at all. Again&mdash;Circum&s;tances, at the fir&s;t blu&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed in the delu&s;ive charms of novelty, have a &s;trength and fal&s;e glow, which, upon a nearer inve&s;tigation, meliorate into &s;ober truth, and wear off the influence of primary prejudice. Thus, had I &s;poken of my friend BOYTON in the moment I was witne&s;s of his wonderful performance, I might have injured him by exaggeration; and in this I give the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible in&s;tance&mdash;becau&s;e language can &s;carcely produce an hyperbole on the &s;ubject. To give a contrary in&s;tance&mdash;Had I not waited till contempt had died away, and given place to indifference, I could not probably have told my &s;tory of the <HI>Iri&s;h Jolmon</HI> with that triumphant coolne&s;s which will never cea&s;e to make a much more uncomfortable wound than the keene&s;t &s;hafts of ha&s;ty re&s;entment.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU who &s;o largely contributed to make BRISTOL agreeable to me, de&s;erve in preference to any other this letter, which I take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing to you&mdash;e&s;pecially as it comes where I am to de&s;cribe tho&s;e beautiful &s;ituations with which that place abounds, and which would for ever have been unknown to me, but for your kind &s;olicitude. You taught me to admire the exten&s;ive and picture&s;que views from DURDHAM DOWN, CLIFDEN HILL, COOK'S FOLLY,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;trange anecdote related of this place. One COOK dreamt that he was bit by an adder, and it &s;o preyed on his mind that he built this place, which is very lofty, and re&s;ided wholly in the upper apartment. One cold day his &s;ervant brought in a faggot that concealed an adder, which, upon being di&s;turbed, flew at Mr. COOK, bit him&mdash;and he died of the wound. The reader may give what portion of credit he plea&s;es to this tale.</NOTE> and KING'S WESTON. Nor had I more plea&s;ure in the charming variety the&s;e &s;weet places afforded than in your conver&s;ation. What a number of circum&s;tances it called home to my recollection, as you pointed out the former theatre to me, where POWELL, HOLLAND,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">What I am now going to relate I know to be fact, and it conveys nearly as &s;trong a pre-&s;entiment as the above. The la&s;t time HOLLAND ever performed he was in unu&s;ual &s;pirits. During the evening, he related a number of anecdotes&mdash;but it was remarkable he continually alluded to POWELL. He re|peated the lines written by Mr. COLMAN, and which he had &s;poken on POWELL's death. At length I heard him repeat the&s;e extraordinary words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The fir&s;t time I ever &s;aw POWELL was at a <HI>&s;pouting-club,</HI> where he and I performed <HI>Po&s;thumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI> The fir&s;t time we ever played on the &s;tage toge|ther was <HI>Po&s;thumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI> The la&s;t time we ever played together&mdash;and, added he, with a &s;igh, it was the la&s;t time HE ever played&mdash;was <HI>Po&s;thumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI>"</Q> What makes this matter &s;ingular, almo&s;t beyond belief, is&mdash;that the time he made the&s;e ob&s;ervations he was performing <HI>Jachimo,</HI> and he died a few days after.</NOTE> and &s;o
<PB N="48" REF="55">
many of the old &s;chool were &s;uch favourites! Poor POWELL! Poor HOL|LAND! The one a &s;acrifice to youthful impetuo&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POWELL was a well di&s;po&s;itioned young man; but he was weak, and his profe&s;&s;ional and per&s;o|nal vanity got the better of every tie or con&s;ideration. He was hand&s;ome, lively, and pre&s;uming; to which, if we add that he was a manager, it will be &s;een that it was an ea&s;y matter to make <HI>his</HI> terms with many of the actre&s;&s;es, provided he acceded to <HI>their's.</HI> Indeed his amours were not confined to the thea|tre, kept-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and demireps were continually &s;ending him letters to the &s;tage-door, none of which &s;olicitations he had the courage to re&s;i&s;t. The con&s;equence was fatal and inevitable&mdash;he died a martyr to his plea&s;ures; for what head could even a robu&s;t con&s;titution make again&s;t the wa&s;teful conflict of mer|cury and &s;timulatives. His acting was &s;trong nature, as luxuriant as a wilderne&s;s. It had a thou&s;and beauties and a thou&s;and faults. He felt &s;o forcibly that in any impa&s;&s;ioned &s;ituation, tears came fa&s;ter than words, and frequently choaked his utterance. If GARRICK had never gone to Italy, and we can &s;uppo&s;e he would have <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> in&s;tructed him&mdash;there was certainly no height of perfection in tragedy, to which &s;uch abilities could not have reached; but GARRICK's performance in real life was not the wor&s;t part of his acting. POWELL, as an actor, vi&s;ibly declined from the moment his tutor turned his back on him&mdash;&s;o much does nature want a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the &s;tage.</NOTE>&mdash;the other, a proof that the mo&s;t rigid prudence is no &s;afeguard again&s;t the grim tyrant.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>HOLLAND was extremely different from POWELL as an actor and a man&mdash;he kept as re&s;pectable a public &s;ituation, and his company was more courted. He had not received a liberal education, but his intellects were of that &s;trong, clear, and decided kind, they performed for him the ta&s;k of a tutor &s;o well, that his de|ci&s;ions, upon all occa&s;ions, were founded in &s;ound judgment and experience. He was free, good-natured, cheerful, and generous&mdash;nor had he an unkind wi&s;h to any human creature. He indulged him&s;elf as much as any young man rea&s;onably ought&mdash;yet, with his pur&s;e and his heart ever open&mdash;though &s;prung from ob&s;curity, which he had too much good &s;en&s;e to conceal&mdash;at the age I believe of thirty-three he le&s;t his family &s;ix thou&s;and pounds. As to his acting, what he wanted of POWELL's natural requi&s;ites, he made up in &s;trong di&s;crimination. One was &s;u&s;ceptible&mdash;the other critical. Whoever remembers their playing tho&s;e favourite parts <HI>Po&s;thumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo</HI> will feel the truth of this ob&s;ervation. POWELL made the &s;tronge&s;t fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. HOLLAND plea&s;ed you mo&s;t upon repetition. POWELL, though he often charmed, &s;ometimes di&s;gu&s;ted you. HOLLAND, even where you could not admire him, gave you no pain. In &s;hort, POWELL owed to nature&mdash;what HOLLAND owed to him&s;elf; and if after all we are obliged to admit &s;omething of pre-eminence on the &s;ide of POWELL, and thus regret his lo&s;s as an ac|tor, we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper &s;igh when we con&s;ider that in HOLLAND we lo&s;t an hone&s;t man, and a valuable member of &s;ociety.</P><P>Before I quit this &s;ubject, I &s;hall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of POOR HOLLAND. He was one of FOOTE's greate&s;t favourites, perhaps in &s;ome mea&s;ure becau&s;e the world &s;aid he was the retailer of his wit; but there was no occa&s;ion, HOLLAND had wit enough of his own&mdash;be&s;ides, Ari&s;to|phanes dealt in the retail way him&s;elf. GEORGE GARRICK, being one of HOLLAND's executors, with his u&s;ual good nature&mdash;for no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more&mdash;undertook to manage the funeral in a way &s;uitable to his friend's circum&s;tances, for which purpo&s;e he went to CHISWICK, and ordered a decent vault, and &s;uch other preparations as he thought nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;HOLLAND's father was a baker. FOOTE was invited to the funeral, which he certainly attended with un&s;eigned &s;orrow; for, exclu&s;ive of his real concern for the lo&s;s of a convivial companion, whenever he had a &s;erious moment, he felt with very &s;trong &s;u&s;ceptibility. While the ceremony was performing, G. GARRICK remarked to FOOTE how happy he was, out of re&s;pect to his friend, to &s;ee every thing &s;o decently conducted.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what a &s;nug family vault we have made here."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>Family vault,</HI>'</Q> &s;aid FOOTE&mdash;with the tears trickling down his cheeks&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Damme, if I did not think it had been&mdash;<HI>the family oven.</HI>'</Q></P></NOTE> From the

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I thought the be&s;t way of thanking you for your let|ter, would be to in&s;ert&mdash;and an&s;wer it. It &s;hall be printed however without your name&mdash;nor &s;hall I publicly u&s;e it at all, though out of kindne&s;s you have &s;tipulated for no &s;uch arrangement. My rea&s;on is, that though <HI>I</HI> may find it nece&s;&s;ary to go to loggerheads with witlings and crotchet-mongers, it would be unhand&s;ome to bring you in as my &s;econd, or even bottle-holder. Thanking you heartily for your zeal and kindne&s;s, and a&s;&s;uring you that I &s;hall take every care to merit your attention to my letters, and by that means in&s;ure my&s;elf the good opinion of the public, I &s;hall fir&s;t, an&s;wering your only remaining &s;cru|ple, proceed on my TOUR. The prejudices of general opinion, from which I believe no man is wholly free, incline one naturally to form ideas of a long voyage, a foreign climate, a &s;trange race of people, and new laws and cu&s;toms, that after fairly and maturely con&s;ulting our rea&s;on we really find do not exi&s;t. The&s;e beget a repugnance to leave our native land, which, were it examined, would be found to originate in folly and ignorance. I am &s;ure there is not more danger in a long voyage than a long journey. I have my&s;elf been overturned, during this TOUR, in a chai&s;e, and was within a very little of breaking my neck. Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t contained, &s;ome time ago, an account of a gen|tleman who having been two voyages to the Ea&s;t-Indies, returned, and in taking
<PB N="52" REF="59">
a &s;hort journey in the mail-coach&mdash;was overturned and killed. As to a foreign climate, can it be wor&s;e than the month of November in England? For &s;trange people&mdash;they are to be met with every where. New laws cannot certainly be better than the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of tho&s;e in this country&mdash;but the <HI>letter</HI> and the <HI>execution</HI> cannot any where be <HI>wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to animadvert a little &s;tronger on this &s;ub|ject. It is very true I leave England, becau&s;e I think I have not been well treated; but &s;urely this is paying a compliment to the liberality of INDIA. They love plea&s;ure&mdash;it is in my power to give it to them. The compact is a fair one; and if they find me capable to take a review of their amu&s;ements, regulate them, &s;upply them with novelty, put them upon an eligible and per|manent footing, and at length leave them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch materials as will induce them to encourage me while I &s;tay, and remember me afterwards&mdash;what will it be between us, but a mutual obligation? And yet, though I ar|gue &s;o coolly, and I hope rea&s;onably, I had till very lately every one of the above vulgar prejudices and ab&s;urd notions&mdash;for which no man alive can invent a rational excu&s;e. Nay, I had eight years ago gone to INDIA, could I have conquered the&s;e &s;cruples, which&mdash;though I had in great mea&s;ure got the better of&mdash;returned with irre&s;i&s;table force, upon receiving the news of my brother's death. My election however is now made; yet, believe me, I go not like an exile. I go to give and receive plea&s;ure and advantage&mdash;to earn hone&s;tly a com|petency, and return with it to my native country. If there be any difficulties to encounter, I &s;hall hope to &s;urmount them, by the means of unconquerable &s;pirits and a &s;trong con&s;titution; and, if after all&mdash;it &s;hould &s;o happen that I am beckoned there by the finger of fate, I could not better obey the &s;ummons than in believing, with our immortal poet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that there's an e&s;pecial providence in the fall of a &s;parrow."</Q> I am not however foolhardy enough to court the accompli&s;hment of this; nor will I &s;ay, with the philo&s;opher, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ungrateful

I could not help fancying that &s;ome public occa&s;ion had in|vited all the inhabitants to a di&s;tance. No &s;uch thing. It aro&s;e from nothing more than&mdash;as the re&s;idents in other places get out, and mix with each other, and thus enjoy the comforts of &s;ociality and good fellow&s;hip&mdash;tho&s;e at GLOU|CESTER &s;tay at home, in their own hugger mugger way&mdash;and form no ac|quaintance but with the cats and crickets, by the fire &s;ide. Without exagge|ration&mdash;'tis &s;o remarkable for its dullne&s;s, that you may, upon an average, look from one end of the &s;treet to the other, twenty times, and not at any one time &s;ee twenty people. This gave me but poor hopes of GLOUCESTER. Nor were my expectations more &s;anguine when, in a conver&s;ation with Mr. RAIKES, I found the town was as much in &s;ackcloth as if there had been a general mourning. Four or five unexpected bankruptcies had thrown them into a con&s;ternation not to be de&s;cribed; which, added to their natural gloom, made GLOUCESTER, at that time, the mo&s;t unfit of all places for making an ex|periment
<PB N="55" REF="62">
with my entertainment. I therefore got into a chai&s;e, and po&s;ted away to CHELTENHAM; but there were yet arrived only a &s;ick lord, an old maid, and a monkey:&mdash;&s;o I &s;tayed all night, &s;lept in a damp bed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is infallible if any one &s;hould &s;leep there in the month of April.</NOTE> and went on to WORCESTER. Of this pretty and very &s;prightly town&mdash;I own&mdash;I au|gured well. Nor was I deceived in my expectations. I found the inhabitants, however, very tardy; and, had it not been for a reverend and honourable gen|tleman&mdash;who never fails to countenance public amu&s;ements whenever he can with propriety&mdash;I &s;hould never have had a &s;econd night. This owed its ri&s;e to a report&mdash;which &s;omebody had very good naturedly propagated&mdash;that I was an impo&s;tor. When one con&s;iders it has been affirmed that a man took thirty pounds to be &s;hot for ADMIRAL BYNG&mdash;and that FOOTE had his leg cut off on purpo&s;e to procure a patent&mdash;or&mdash;as &s;ome have maintained&mdash;to give him a graceful hitch in his walk&mdash;is it wonderful that a &s;tranger &s;hould have &s;ome difficulty in proving his own identity? They were, however, rea&s;oned with in the following manner. 'Tis true this man may po&s;&s;ibly not be Mr. DIBDIN&mdash;in which ca&s;e, tho&s;e who attend his performance would be &s;ubject to &s;ome kind of raillery; but it is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible he may be the very identical man&mdash;and, that admitted, would not his departure in dudgeon bring a &s;tronger ridicule on the place? <Q REND="inline">'Suppo&s;e,'</Q> &s;aid a few&mdash;who really were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;omething like rea&s;on&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the fir&s;t performance &s;hould be watched with a critical eye, and a report &s;pread as to its merit, and the originality of its fabrication&mdash;if he be an impo&s;tor, it will be then time enough to give way to our re&s;entment: if not, &s;urely he de&s;erves &s;ome apology, and future attention&mdash;for having paid us the compliment to come among us.'</Q> So &s;aid&mdash;&s;o done. I was attended by eleven critics, who, I am &s;ure, had made up their minds before they came&mdash;for it &s;o happened that they had good &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee there does not exi&s;t a man who could have performed what I promi&s;ed and yet have been an impo&s;tor.&mdash;I plainly perceived the drift of this <HI>manoeuvre,</HI> and went through my enter|tainment with a &s;pirit that &s;urpri&s;ed my audience. When I had fini&s;hed&mdash;an
<PB N="56" REF="63">
apology was made me, in the name of the city of WORCESTER&mdash;and, to be brief, I had afterwards four very decent nights; and, that not &s;atisfying them, they exacted a promi&s;e from me to return in the race week.</P>
<P>The report of my being an impo&s;tor originated from an unmarried lady, who had &s;een me, &s;he &s;aid, at BIRMINGHAM, and who&mdash;as &s;he did not confe&s;s her&s;elf a member of the tribe of old maids&mdash;was not a little nettled, as I after|wards under&s;tood, when I remarked&mdash;upon hearing this &s;tory&mdash;that her love of ju&s;tice had got the better of her <HI>amour propre</HI>; for, that by mentioning BIRMINGHAM&mdash;where I had not been for twenty-five years&mdash;&s;he was tacitly obliged to agree to an age rather more ancient than it was her u&s;ual cu&s;tom to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak of WORCESTER more fully on my return&mdash;and, in the mean time, beg the favour of your company to BIRMINGHAM&mdash;whither I went in the &s;tage coach, in company with a plain, agreeable man, who I could very &s;oon perceive was intimately concerned in &s;ome large manufactory. As I am, upon all occa&s;ions, ju&s;t as willing that the laugh &s;hould go again&s;t my|&s;elf as another, I here inform you of a matter in which I conceived my&s;elf to be wonderfully &s;agacious. About ten months before the period I &s;peak of&mdash;or, as Mr. BAYES has it, long before the beginning of this play&mdash;I went, with a party, to dinner at the ISLE OF WIGHT, where a genteel man &s;ent in his compliments, and reque&s;ted he might dine with the company. Our own being rather a promi&s;cuous meeting, he was readily admitted. He turned out to be a plea&s;ant, chatty companion&mdash;&s;eemed to be very ready on every general topic&mdash;but the whole of his conver&s;ation appeared purpo&s;ely to allude to his being a man of property. I took it for granted that he was &s;o&mdash;and did not te&s;tify a little &s;urpri&s;e when the landlord told me he was a rider, or what they call in York&s;hire&mdash;<HI>a bagman.</HI> I was determined afterwards to take care who I believed to be men of property&mdash;and this Journey from WORCESTER to BIRMINGHAM was the fir&s;t time afterward that my &s;u&s;picions were awakened.
<PB N="57" REF="64">
Every time the gentleman was talking of bills of parcels and bails of goods, I could not get rid of the idea of&mdash;<HI>bagman</HI>; and, before we arrived, I had actu|ally &s;et him down for a vain, empty pretender to property&mdash;a pattern carrier&mdash;a &s;tirrup holder&mdash;in &s;hort, the very &s;hadow of what he appeared to be. Dur|ing the interval between our arrival and dinner, he went out&mdash;and the waiter a&s;king if I knew who that gentleman was, I an&s;wered carele&s;&s;ly&mdash;&s;ome bagman I fancy. <Q REND="inline">'Bagman!'</Q> cried the waiter, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the gentleman is worth eighty thou&s;and pounds!&mdash;a great clothier, near CHELTENHAM.'</Q> This incident may &s;erve to &s;hew how deceitful are appearances! and it &s;hould teach us this le&s;&s;on&mdash;to pay every object its proper degree of re&s;pect:&mdash;for as there is no rank, ever &s;o high, but vice may deba&s;e&mdash;&s;o there is no &s;tation, ever &s;o low, but virtue will exalt. Both the&s;e men behaved very properly. One kept a little higher than his real rank, like an able amba&s;&s;ador, to demand re&s;pect to his ma&s;ter&mdash;while the other, like a king, conde&s;cended a little&mdash;to &s;hew he had no pride.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUT of three times that I adverti&s;ed my entertain|ment at BIRMINGHAM&mdash;I performed it only twice. The&s;e fuliginous &s;ons of Vulcan were, at my arrival, too bu&s;ily attending to feats of hor&s;eman&s;hip&mdash;a &s;pecies of amu&s;ement ever fatal to my intere&s;t&mdash;to take any notice of me. One thing completely di&s;gu&s;ted me. At WORCESTER it was &s;ugge&s;ted to me that, as my price was three &s;hillings, the trade&s;men and others in middling &s;ituations could not afford to pay that &s;um, or mix with the company who could&mdash;and, therefore, I made a di&s;tinction; and, partitioning the town hall&mdash;which is very large&mdash;admitted company at three &s;hillings and eighteen-pence. The &s;pirit of the people was rou&s;ed at this circum&s;tance&mdash;and very few indeed were to be found in the back &s;eats, while tho&s;e in the front were crowded. Upon making the &s;ame experiment at BIRMINGHAM, it was exactly the re|ver&s;e&mdash;for as the inhabitants of WORCESTER, of middling property, made a point of paying three &s;hillings, &s;o people of very con&s;iderable property in BIR|MINGHAM, &s;kulked in at eighteen-pence. One circum&s;tance, I own, made me look upon BIRMINGHAM as a very likely place for &s;ucce&s;s. It was the fir&s;t town in which I appeared as an actor; and, as I &s;ignified this by a para|graph in the hand bills, and made&mdash;what I there &s;aid&mdash;a &s;ort of invitation, to witne&s;s the maturity of tho&s;e abilities which they had &s;een in their infancy,
<PB N="59" REF="66">
I naturally &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould awaken their curio&s;ity&mdash;and that they would be pouring in by hundreds. Not a bit. The people of BIRMINGHAM were too much taken up with hobnails and hor&s;eman&s;hip to pay me the lea&s;t atten|tion. Upon mentioning my &s;urpri&s;e to a Frenchman, he exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>Mon dieu que e&s;t ce que voulez vous? Comment agir pour faire un cheval vuider l'avoine q'il n'ai jamais mange</HI>'.</Q> I confe&s;&s;ed the ju&s;tice of the remark, and comforted my&s;elf with a letter I had in my pocket from Dr. HAYES, enclo&s;ing one from THE VICE CHANCELLOR, which gave me leave to come to OXFORD for three days in the following week.</P>
<P>Thus I left BIRMINGHAM&mdash;without being able to &s;ing the glee of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Smiths are good fellows."</Q> Of my journey to OXFORD, I can give you no farther account&mdash;having travelled in the night&mdash;than, that at the <HI>White Lion</HI> at STRATFORD-UPON-AVON&mdash;that very Inn which I &s;aw in &s;uch confu&s;ion at the JUBILEE&mdash;we had the mo&s;t &s;candalous &s;upper that ever was &s;et upon a table. But as, on my return to WORCESTER, I &s;hall have &s;omething to &s;ay further of this hou&s;e, you will now, if you plea&s;e, attend me to Dr. HAYES, who received me with his accu&s;tomed cordiality and politene&s;s. We &s;ettled the mode of commencing the entertainment, and I waited on the VICE CHANCELLOR to thank him for his kindne&s;s, and reque&s;t that I might &s;ub|mit the copy of my amu&s;ement to his in&s;pection. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;he had a particular plea&s;ure in obliging me; and&mdash;as he did not &s;uppo&s;e I would offer any entertainment to the &s;tudents unworthy my reputation or their attention&mdash;he tru&s;ted the matter wholly to me, and thought a peru&s;al of the copy totally unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night was announced&mdash;and with every care and circum&s;pec|tion I prepared for it. I cut out <HI>Grog,</HI> and introduced&mdash;for the fir&s;t time it was ever &s;ung&mdash;<HI>The Siege of Troy.</HI> I took occa&s;ion&mdash;merely becau&s;e I felt it&mdash;to introduce an oblique compliment to Dr. CHAPMAN; which afterwards, as
<PB N="60" REF="67">
I under&s;tood, was in&s;erted with &s;ome hand&s;ome remarks in the OXFORD paper.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The compliment was this. I &s;aid SOLON was no enemy to plea&s;ure. He only condemned tho&s;e fictitious repre&s;entations which concealed the deformity of vice, and gave countenance to lawle&s;s enjoy|ments. He went one night to &s;ee one of the&s;e performances, which THESPIS conducted. When it was over he a&s;ked the comedian if he was not a&s;hamed of him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What harm have I done?'</Q> &s;aid THESPIS <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">''twas only in je&s;t'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'true'</Q> &s;aid SOLON&mdash;but approving vice in je&s;t is the &s;ure&s;t way to make it admired in earne&s;t.</NOTE> In &s;hort, I performed the three nights, for which I had permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;and was granted, at the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tance of many members of the univer&s;ity a <HI>fourth</HI>&mdash;and I may truly &s;ay, as to applau&s;e, no man ever experienced han&s;omer encou|ragement. The profit, however, was only what I have before mentioned.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at OXFORD I became more intimate with Dr. HAYES&mdash;and, as our conver&s;ations on <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> were very frequent, he could not help tell|ing me what trouble he had been put to, at different times&mdash;though he had never &s;een me&mdash;to defend my reputation again&s;t the malignity of the ignorant and the invidious. The&s;e conver&s;ations fini&s;hed with my making him a &s;ort of half promi&s;e to put a &s;top to the tongue of envy, by compo&s;ing the proper exerci&s;e and taking the complicate degree of <HI>Bachelor</HI> and <HI>Doctor</HI> of MUSIC. This promi&s;e, however, &s;o given, I fancy I &s;hall not keep. I de|&s;pi&s;e envy too much to fear it&mdash;and, therefore, cannot conde&s;cend to &s;ilence it. As to the exerci&s;e, it is compo&s;ed&mdash;and&mdash;be it known to the mu&s;ical critics&mdash;though it is a ta&s;k infinitely more complex than any thing I had before done&mdash;I never &s;et my&s;elf an ea&s;ier le&s;&s;on in my life: &s;o much le&s;s difficult is it to work by <HI>method</HI> than <HI>fancy.</HI> As, however, the &s;ong of hope is a part of it, one half of the kingdom will witne&s;s for me that melody and harmony may be blended; and, as I &s;hall, previous to my departure, make a pre&s;ent of the overture to &s;ome of the fir&s;t concerts&mdash;particularly tho&s;e of LIVERPOOL, MANCHESTER, and LEEDS&mdash;the mo&s;t rigid theori&s;t &s;hall be obliged to con|fe&s;s&mdash;that the fir&s;t <HI>&s;ugue</HI> I ever thought it worth my while to make, is one of my be&s;t compo&s;itions: for it does not wrong my own-e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim&mdash;of never lo&s;ing &s;ight of melody&mdash;yet it extends and expatiates through all the wide
<PB N="61" REF="68">
field of modulation. If the cavillers take up this, let them con&s;ider it merely as a whet&mdash;by and by they &s;hall have a full meal.</P>
<P>At OXFORD, I received a letter from a friend, informing me, that my little piece of <HI>Harve&s;t Home</HI> had been performed, and received with very great applau&s;e. To corroborate this account, I &s;ent the next day for the <HI>Morning Chronicle,</HI> where I found it &s;poken of in the highe&s;t terms.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I will not leave OXFORD, without noticing the civility which, in addition to that of Dr. HAYES and the VICE CHANCELLOR, I re|ceived from that fine, hearty, friendly character, Mr. JACKSON, the book&s;eller; nor mu&s;t the great attention &s;hewn me by that able arti&s;t, Mr. ROBERTS, pa&s;s un&s;ung&mdash;who&s;e paintings, and in particular his &s;mall whole lengths are remark|able for &s;pirit, expre&s;&s;ion, good drawing, and exact &s;imilitude. No &s;tronger in|&s;tances of the latter quality in them can be given than the following circum|&s;tance. When I was at WOLVERHAMPTON, a gentleman came into the room, and being mu&s;ical, chatted with me &s;ome minutes before the performance. I thought I had met with him before&mdash;but it turned out that I had &s;een only his portrait at Mr. ROBERTS's&mdash;that di&s;tance of time was at lea&s;t three months; and as I never &s;aw either original or portrait more than once, and that for a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, the re&s;emblance mu&s;t have been not only correct, but very &s;triking indeed. This gentleman's name is SPENCE, and he is a &s;tudent at the Univer&s;ity. Mr. ROBERTS does not want my recommendation&mdash;if he did, I &s;hould &s;trongly advi&s;e tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pre&s;erve their likene&s;&s;es, and po&s;&s;e&s;s at the &s;ame time good paintings, to apply to him.</P>
<P>Before I &s;et out for London, I &s;ent a letter of thanks to the VICE CHANCEL|LOR,
<PB N="63" REF="70">
which I &s;incerely wi&s;h I could remember, as it would &s;erve admirably well, by way of contra&s;t, to one that will appear in the next letter, which I kept a copy of&mdash;the transaction that occa&s;ioned it having fixed in me a firm determination to publi&s;h this work.</P>
<P>OXFORD is &s;o well known that it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay but little about it. Every child knows that it has thirteen pari&s;h churches, twenty col|leges and five halls, which being intermixed with the hou&s;es, give it an air of &s;uperb magnificence not perhaps to be equalled in the world. As to its <HI>mu&s;ical ta&s;te,</HI> I need not &s;ay more in its prai&s;e than that Dr. HAYES is their profe&s;&s;or of mu&s;ic. The inns are, in term time, filled con&s;tantly with riots&mdash;which render them very uncomfortable to &s;trangers. Nor can this be re&s;trained. The autho|rity of the mo&s;t powerful, or the examples of the be&s;t man upon earth&mdash;and it will be difficult to find out a better than Dr. CHAPMAN&mdash;can avail but little, while fathers, in&s;tead of a mode&s;t &s;tipend &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a &s;tudent, &s;end their &s;ons to the Univer&s;ity, one would think, to plunge them into extra|vagance, and di&s;qualify them for every &s;tudy&mdash;but <HI>profligacy</HI> and <HI>brutality.</HI> And now, in my u&s;ual way, mu&s;t I break off to throw together &s;ome of tho&s;e thoughts which have often &s;truck me on this important &s;ubject. The young gentlemen of the Univer&s;ity have generally &s;eparate tutors. I do not &s;ay the following re|marks apply to every tutor; but do they, generally under&s;tood, con&s;ider any thing but the plea&s;ures of the pupil? Nay, are they not often commanded to do &s;o? Is not his vanity gratified? Are not his wi&s;hes anticipated? Is there an incentive to idlene&s;s, a &s;timulative to di&s;&s;ipation, but it is their &s;tudy to procure? Are mi&s;demeanors to be inve&s;tigated?&mdash;they wrack invention to find an excu&s;e. Is plea&s;ure the word?&mdash;the tutor is the jollie&s;t fellow in the throng. In &s;hort, would you teach your &s;on to trample upon rea&s;on, violate decorum, de&s;troy every &s;ocial trace of virtue, and to fini&s;h&mdash;in his own language&mdash;knock down order, give him a tutor that will pa&s;s mu&s;ter among the re&s;t; if he be of any other de&s;cription, he will be hunted down with unde&s;erved calumny till he &s;hall be obliged either to take refuge in a &s;chool, or behind the reading-de&s;k
<PB N="64" REF="71">
of a country curate. And the mi&s;chief is&mdash;it is &s;o difficult to make a choice. Sanctity is no more to be tru&s;ted than the grief of an actor, which con|tinues only till the curtain drops, to make room for the farce that is to follow it. Thus fools come in as large &s;hoals from the Univer&s;ity, as knaves from church. Your right collegian can give you vices of an hundred years &s;tanding a new-cut to bring them into fa&s;hion&mdash;but, as to books, they are the &s;ame to him as drugs to an apothecary&mdash;both are pre&s;cribed and both taken; but neither the <HI>phy&s;ic</HI> by the DOCTOR, nor <HI>letters</HI> by the SCHOLAR. A &s;et of unintelligent terms &s;erve the purpo&s;e of both, and one admini&s;ters to the body and the other to the mind, while they tru&s;t to chance for the &s;ucce&s;s of the operation.</P>
<P>Of natural curio&s;ities&mdash;I believe there are none at OXFORD. Artificial ones manufactured there may be &s;een in many of the pulpits throughout the king|dom.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay I am &s;omewhat too hard&mdash;for this &s;hould &s;eem to imply that our univer&s;ities produce nothing but dunces. I allow, which is a great deal, that, once in ten times, they may turn out a man of tolerable abili|ties&mdash;two thirds of the remainder are but at be&s;t <HI>Pedants</HI>&mdash;fellows who go over a whole library&mdash;book by book&mdash;as faithfully as a MOTH; but who&mdash;after they have both <HI>read</HI> and <HI>retained</HI> every thing&mdash;have not &s;ufficient ta&s;te to di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;ingle literary beauty. The re&s;t&mdash;as I have de&s;cribed above&mdash;are either pretty fellows, or jolly dogs&mdash;a &s;et of beings comparatively le&s;s obnoxious in propor|tion as they approach to in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>I returned to LONDON on Monday the twenty-fir&s;t of May, exactly in time&mdash;as I mentioned in my la&s;t letter&mdash;to &s;ee <HI>Harve&s;t Home</HI> on the <HI>fourth night</HI>; from which circum&s;tance, I as po&s;itively predicted its downfall, as Mr. WOOD|FALL had done its popularity. That very evening I formed&mdash;what I thought amounted to a re&s;olution of drawing my pen no more for the &s;tage; but &s;o much was I mi&s;taken, that three days afterwards I caught my&s;elf fini&s;hing a &s;eene in
<PB N="65" REF="72">
I think the be&s;t piece I have ever written. But any one would have done the &s;ame.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the &s;eventh of June I quitted LONDON for CAMBRIDGE. In the coach happened to be a gentleman of &s;ome medical con|&s;equence in the city, who not only turned out a very agreeable companion, but made &s;ome of the be&s;t general remarks I ever li&s;tened to. The&s;e, though I may avail my&s;elf of &s;ome of them in the cour&s;e of my work, I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing of here. I cannot refrain, however, from giving his opinion&mdash;which I earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, as that &s;ubject came up among a number of others&mdash;con|cerning the execution of DONNELLAN. I could not withhold my&s;elf from re|probating, in pretty &s;trong terms, the pre-judgment in that bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;the rigour &s;hewn from the bench&mdash;where the pri&s;oner &s;hould never want an advocate; and, in particular, the remarkable circum&s;tance&mdash;that the charge to the GRAND JURY, <HI>previous to the trial</HI>&mdash;contained the <HI>very</HI> words of the &s;entence of CON|DEMNATION; all of which, I believe the public have but one opinion of.&mdash;This gentleman's &s;entiments of the matter, as a phy&s;ician&mdash;&s;etting a&s;ide all the non&s;en&s;ical controver&s;ies that have happened concerning the quality of <HI>laurel water</HI>&mdash;he very &s;en&s;ibly confined to this: That poi&s;on of any kind could not effect death &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly&mdash;the &s;horte&s;t period between the &s;wallowing of poi&s;on and the con&s;equent death, that he had ever heard of in all his practice,
<PB N="67" REF="74">
was nearly <HI>four hours,</HI> and SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON is &s;aid to have died in le&s;s time than <HI>one minute.</HI> In &s;hort, &s;aid he, if that phial contained any thing of DONNELLAN's invention which actually cau&s;ed that &s;udden death &s;worn to by the mother, he di&s;covered what no other ever did. Unle&s;s it was one of tho&s;e &s;ecrets which Dr. MEAD is &s;aid to have kept from the world, le&s;t, knowing human depravity, he might be the in&s;trument of providing them with a novel opportunity of perpetrating the dictates of a cowardly and diabolical revenge. As to Dr. RETRAY's killing rats and dogs to prove he had been mi&s;taken when he &s;wore SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON was poi&s;oned with ar&s;enic, we laughed at it as it de&s;erved; but when we came to con&s;ider that Dr. HUNTER was pinned to a &s;ingle que&s;tion, namely, whether the decea&s;ed died of poi&s;on or not&mdash;which no man could have po&s;itively an&s;wered&mdash;we agreed in a &s;incere wi&s;h that the learned interpreter of the law&mdash;who acted the part of judge and jury upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;was in his own mind clearly and fully convinced of the pri&s;oner's guilt; and &s;o with that laudable and upright dete&s;tation&mdash;with which his lord&s;hip is well known to accelerate the extermina|tion of murderers&mdash;he re&s;olved that the victim then in his power &s;hould not e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I was unfortunate enough to lo&s;e this gentleman's company after we had travelled together about &s;ix and thirty miles. On my arrival in CAMBRIDGE, where I cannot refrain from noticing, that though the coach from <HI>Gray's Inn Lane</HI> is bound to the <HI>White Hart</HI>&mdash;yet the pa&s;&s;engers will far every di&s;agreeably, if they are obliged, as I was, to &s;tay all night. As &s;oon as I could, the follow|ing morning, I got into a lodging, and began to make my preparations in form. I delivered a letter to Dr. RANDALL, who begged to be excu&s;ed from taking an active part in the bu&s;ine&s;s, on account of his age, and the re&s;olution he had made not to concern him&s;elf but as little as po&s;&s;ible with public matters. I afterwards called on a gentleman of Trinity College, to whom I had a very friendly and pre&s;&s;ing letter from a man of fortune in town&mdash;but unluckily the gentleman was not then at CAMBRIDGE. My next application was of cour&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="75">
to the VICE CHANCELLOR; and as every other channel was&mdash;as the reader has &s;een&mdash;dammed up, my only reliance was on the permi&s;&s;ion I had received from Dr. CHAPMAN, and &s;ome other documents which I put in my pocket for his in&s;pection. But as this interview, and the re&s;ult of it, make too marking a part of my TOUR not to have every po&s;&s;ible advantage&mdash;I &s;hall give &s;o &s;ingular a tran&s;action a letter by it&s;elf. I have &s;hewn, in this letter, a judicial cur in office&mdash;in my next I &s;hall give you the portrait of a clerical one:&mdash;but all the&s;e are the foils that &s;et off the brilliancy of true friend&s;hip, and the value of &s;ter|ling worth&mdash;for the knowledge of the&s;e kind and e&s;timable qualities in you, give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you that I am,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have often wondered that in the common tran&s;ac|tions of life men meet with &s;uch continual rudene&s;s, when civility is &s;o cheap, and &s;o becoming. If hackney coachmen and waiters made a point of u&s;ing a little of this good quality, they would find them&s;elves richer, and lead more comfortable lives. But if rudene&s;s be unpardonable in tho&s;e we rule, for hea|ven's &s;ake what is it in tho&s;e who rule us! A man in a high and re&s;pectable &s;ituation can add nothing to his dignity &s;o truly great as complacency and gentlene&s;s of manners. Thus, the VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD, who is an ab&s;olute monarch for the time being&mdash;like a little Emperor of GER|MANY&mdash;di&s;pen&s;es his decrees with &s;uch impartial even-handed ju&s;tice, and tender regard to his own honour and the &s;u&s;ceptibility of individuals, that a man mu&s;t be &s;elf-condemned before he puni&s;hes him; and, I will venture to &s;ay, that if any con&s;ideration could induce a di&s;tinction in his conduct or carriage to any different de&s;criptions of men who, on various accounts, have occa&s;ion to apply to him, the benevolent affability which &s;o eminently characteri&s;es him, would be con&s;picuou&s;ly extended to the mo&s;t unfortunate
<PB N="70" REF="77">
among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;aw once a noble in&s;tance of this triumphant philanthropy in the conduct of the late Sir JOHN FIELDING. A man was examined before him upon a charge of a high-way robbery, in&s;tituted by a gentleman of di&s;tinction, who &s;wore po&s;itively to every circum&s;tance of the robbery, yet could not identify the per&s;on. In the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, the right honourable witne&s;s &s;eemed extremely of|fended that Sir JOHN FIELDING &s;hould pay the pri&s;oner &s;o much re&s;pect, and him, as he thought, &s;o very little&mdash;for which di&s;content he received the following rebuke. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am heartily &s;orry that you are offended at my &s;oftening the rigour of ju&s;tice with a little humanity. The pri&s;oner is entitled more to my attention than you are&mdash;becau&s;e he is unfortunate. If he &s;hould be guilty, the law is &s;evere enough without any exaggeration on my part; but if innocent, how could I excu&s;e my&s;elf&mdash;by adding in&s;ult to misfortune?'</Q></NOTE>. What then can be &s;aid of a VICE CHANCELLOR OF CAM|BRIDGE, who has equal power, and who&s;e haughty and imperious deport|ment, &s;ullen a&s;pect, and premature determination, &s;eem&mdash;contrary to all ac|knowledged ju&s;tice&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e every man guilty till he is proved innocent? Such a VICE CHANCELLOR mu&s;t &s;urely be unfit for his &s;ituation. He mu&s;t be uncandid, ungenerous, and unju&s;t; and&mdash;what are terrible qualities in that high character&mdash;ignorant and incapable of di&s;crimination. Le&s;t it &s;hould be thought I had Dr. ELLISON in view when I drew the above portrait, I will entreat the reader to attend minutely to what pa&s;&s;ed during my interview with that gentleman&mdash;and afterwards, in con&s;equence of it&mdash;and it will be plainly &s;een whether he meant any thing more than a faithful di&s;charge of the duties of that office committed to his care.</P>
<P>I had waited on Dr. ELLISON, who was not to be &s;poken with&mdash;I therefore, by way of breaking the ice, entreated Mr. WYNN, who keeps a mu&s;ic &s;hop, to call and leave &s;ome of my bills. That done&mdash;after four vi&s;its to no purpo&s;e&mdash;I was at length admitted; and my memory&mdash;which is pretty faithful&mdash;a&s;&s;ures me what follows was the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAMBRIDGE having detained me a week to no purpo&s;e, I was per&s;uaded to try HUNTINGDON, which place was &s;aid to have a very &s;pirited neighbourhood. LORD SANDWICH not being then at HINCH|INBROOK, none of the mu&s;ical tribe would &s;tir a peg without their fir&s;t fiddle&mdash;and having performed <HI>one night</HI> to an audience of about twenty-five, who were not in the habit of following a leader, I flattered my&s;elf by the &s;atisfac|tion tho&s;e few received, a <HI>&s;econd</HI> would be worth trial. But I had not con|&s;idered, that on that very evening MADAME MARA performed at CAM|BRIDGE, or I &s;hould not have been &s;o ab&s;urd as to expect that any lover of <HI>mu&s;ic,</HI> within twenty miles, would lo&s;e the opportunity of hearing her. I was &s;o thinly attended that I would not perform&mdash;and the next day &s;et off, with a view of going to NORWICH. I cannot refrain from mentioning a &s;en&s;ible remark of the MAYOR, to whom, as commanding officer, I as u&s;ual applied. <Q REND="inline">'Sir,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it is not in my power to give you permi&s;&s;ion: on the con|trary, I am expre&s;&s;ly ordered by the late proclamation, as MAYOR of this town, to prevent every exhibition not authorized by a regular licence.&mdash;Now, as according to the pre&s;ent laws there cannot be a licence to tolerate any &s;ort of amu&s;ement at HUNTINGDON, nor indeed at any other place more
<PB N="76" REF="83">
than twenty-one miles out of LONDON; and, as it is certainly unfair that we &s;hould be denied rational amu&s;ements, I &s;hall, as long as my office con|tinues, take the liberty to make this di&s;tinction. Whenever an entertain|ment pre&s;ents it&s;elf that, like yours, promi&s;es to give plea&s;ure without being immoral, although I give no leave as a magi&s;trate&mdash;I will certainly, as a man, recommend it to the attention of my friends. If, therefore, you &s;hould think proper to perform, I dare &s;ay nobody will inform again&s;t you; and if you wi&s;h for the Town-hall, the man who takes care of it will, no doubt, let you have it for a mere trifle.'</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;ure you will pardon me for noticing this gentlemanlike conduct. I &s;hall, in the cour&s;e of this work, go into a full de&s;cription of the laws re|lative to public amu&s;ements&mdash;to which I am very competent, having had as much public and private legal advice as any man.</P>
<P>HUNTINGDON&mdash;which gave birth to OLIVER CROMWELL&mdash;is a pretty town. It lies, however, on a flat, and the pro&s;pect near it is remarkable for nothing but a number of hand&s;ome &s;pires. The road to CAMBRIDGE is very fine. The hair-dre&s;&s;er gave me a long account of the number of pari&s;hes it formerly had&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'but alas Sir,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'they are now dwindled&mdash;and we have only four <HI>church yards,</HI> three <HI>&s;pires,</HI> two <HI>churches,</HI> and one PARSON.'</Q></P>
<P>When I came to NEWMARKET, in my way to NORWICH, upon hear|ing the races were to be the following week at IPSWICH, I changed my de&s;ign, and went to that place. I found it in glorious confu&s;ion, and trying to get a lodging, I di&s;covered a <HI>manaeuvre,</HI> the mention of which may &s;erve as a cau|tion to tho&s;e who mean to vi&s;it any place in the <HI>race-week.</HI> The landlord of one of the principal inns had adverti&s;ed his beds at a guinea a-piece; and fear|ing, on account of the exorbitant demand, that vi&s;itors &s;hould be induced to take lodgings, he procured, with great cunning and indu&s;try, a promi&s;e from the other inhabitants that they would a&s;k the &s;ame price. What was the con|&s;equence?
<PB N="77" REF="84">
IPSWICH is very large, and the &s;trangers naturally &s;aid, If we can get lodgings no cheaper at private hou&s;es than at inns, we had better be where our hor&s;es can be taken care of. Thus, few private lodgings were let&mdash;the inns were full&mdash;and the landlords laughed at the credulity of their neigh|bours.</P>
<P>At IPSWICH I gave my entertainment twice before I went to COLCHES|TER, and once at my return. The two fir&s;t times I was as well attended as, con&s;idering the number of amu&s;ements that poured in from all quarters, I had a right to expect. The fourth night, however, was to make me large amends; but, like my dependences in general, turned out a rotten one.&mdash;An unfortunate and truly ridiculous circum&s;tance happened to give a fort of tacit umbrage to many of the company there. It was this. I was invited to &s;up with about eight of the leading gentlemen; and as they had a ball that evening, and it was very unlikely that the&s;e eight &s;hould &s;up away from the general meeting, where as &s;ort of &s;tewards their pre&s;ence &s;eemed to be ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;u&s;pected &s;ome artifice in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Now it is a rule with me&mdash;as I was once under the unplea&s;ant nece&s;&s;ity of hinting to one of my auditors&mdash;that when I am &s;tuck up in my temporary orche&s;tra and playing my tricks, I am unconditionally at the devotion of the audience, but before or after my performance&mdash;as there was never any thing either imperious or pre|&s;uming in my deportment, of which I am &s;ure I &s;hould have witne&s;&s;es enow were I to a&s;k it&mdash;I cannot con&s;ent to con&s;ider my&s;elf in an ineligible light.&mdash;Whether this rule &s;truck the&s;e gentlemen and ladies as fal&s;e con&s;equence, improper pride, or what, I will not determine, but certainly the invitation to &s;upper, meant nothing more than that I &s;hould relieve the <HI>pipe</HI> and <HI>taber,</HI> by doing my utmo&s;t&mdash;to <HI>entertain the company.</HI> And here I cannot, for the life of me, avoid pau&s;ing to tell two &s;tories of poor SHUTER.</P>
<P>This child of humour was at a dinner one day, in a promi&s;cuous com|pany&mdash;and, as &s;oon as the cloth was taken away, one of them got up and
<PB N="78" REF="85">
entreated, as a particular favour, he would begin, to be comical. <Q REND="inline">"God,"</Q> &s;aid SHUTER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I forgot my fool's dre&s;s&mdash;but, however, I'll go and fetch it, if you'll be my &s;ub&s;titute till I return."</Q> The man thought this very comical, and declared he would. SHUTER then took his hat and cane&mdash;went away&mdash;and did not return at all.</P>
<P>Another time&mdash;a &s;et of warm citizens, who had been u&s;ed to the com|pany of BENNET&mdash;an actor of very mediocre abilities, at <HI>Covent Garden The|atre</HI>&mdash;got SHUTER to a tavern in the city.&mdash;No man's intellects were ever &s;tronger, nor did any utter brighter &s;allies of wit and plea&s;antry. At every good thing the gaping citizens were in raptures. SHUTER could not con|ceive the rea&s;on of &s;uch <HI>very</HI> lavi&s;h prai&s;es&mdash;till, at length, hearing one of them exclaim, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh that's great!&mdash;that's charming!&mdash;that's &s;o like BENNET!'</Q> He was immediately let into the &s;ecret. BENNET was, with them, all that wit and humour could comprize; and they had not the &s;malle&s;t idea of pay|ing him an ill compliment by comparing him to their favourite. But to return.</P>
<P>Having given a pretty &s;hrewd gue&s;s at what was going forward, I went to the Coffee-hou&s;e&mdash;in BOOTS. The gentleman who invited me was evi|dently di&s;appointed at my appearance&mdash;and this confirmed my &s;u&s;picions.&mdash;I told him&mdash;as the party was private, and con&s;i&s;ted only of gentlemen&mdash;I had taken the liberty to come with no ceremony; e&s;pecially as I &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of going to COLCHESTER early in the morning. He he&s;itated&mdash;and we were joined in the Coffee-room by other gentlemen, through who&s;e enquiries, after &s;upper, the murder came out. I immediately wi&s;hed this gentleman a good night&mdash;&s;aying&mdash;it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to mix with the company in that trim&mdash;and gave a &s;trong hint that I could not con&s;ent to be a performer any where but in my own entertainment. The ju&s;tice of my re|mark was admitted&mdash;and I retired. At my return from COLCHESTER, this gentleman told me it was impo&s;&s;ible to blame what I had done, but that it
<PB N="79" REF="86">
threw an univer&s;al gloom over the company&mdash;every expectation was balked, and they never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o unplea&s;ant an evening.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was not the only time. The &s;ame trick was attempted to be played me at WORCESTER. At ten o'clock at night, a gentleman&mdash;in white gloves, and without a hat&mdash;catched me bu&s;ily writing&mdash;with a long beard&mdash;and would fain have me&mdash;becau&s;e a lady, whom he afterwards married, took &s;uch a whim in her head&mdash;go with him to the a&s;&s;embly-room, to eat &s;upper, and &s;ing catches and glees.&mdash;I was obliged to tell him, in a few &s;hort words, that I could not think of any &s;uch thing; and if I had not been convinced&mdash;as it afterwards turned out&mdash;that every body di&s;approved of his conduct&mdash;but what will not a hot pur&s;uit after a large fortune make a man do?&mdash;I would have left WORCESTER the next morning&mdash;but I had the plea&s;ure to find what I had done extremely approved of; and though I had no more of that gentleman's company, my numbers were not le&s;&s;ened by my refu&s;al to comply with his caprice.</NOTE> Thus was I expected, like SHUTER, to be comical, or jump over a &s;tick at the word of command; but I was determined to convince them I had not &s;o much docility. Be&s;ides&mdash;after all&mdash;there might be &s;ome BENNET or other who&s;e comic abilities I might not have been able to equal.</P>
<P>How far the gentleman I here allude to had a &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s, I will not pretend to &s;ay. I have given a faithful relation of it&mdash;and as, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, he was very attentive to me&mdash;though there certainly was a blunder &s;omewhere&mdash;it would be ungenerous in me to &s;uppo&s;e he meant any thing more than my intere&s;t. I ought not, <HI>ab origine,</HI> to have been deceived&mdash;and a worthy baronet, with whom I conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, at BURY&mdash;and who was to have been of the party&mdash;agreed I had been di&s;ingenuou&s;ly dealt with. However, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as old birds are not caught with chaff,"</Q> I took care&mdash;though it affected my intere&s;t a little&mdash;it &s;hould not make me ridicu|lous.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO COLCHESTER I po&s;ted&mdash;and being recom|mended by the ingenious Mr. MOORE&mdash;who&s;e <HI>clock</HI> and other curio&s;ities all the world has &s;een, and wondered at&mdash;to the <HI>White Hart.</HI> I there received a hearty welcome to&mdash;as he &s;aid&mdash;the land of Oy&s;ters, Baize, and Eringo, from Mr. REYNOLDS, who is known among his <HI>&s;uperiors</HI> by the title of <HI>hone&s;t George</HI>&mdash;by his <HI>equals</HI> as a kind friend and AGREEABLE COMPANION&mdash;and among his <HI>inferiors</HI> as a <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>liberal benefactor.</HI> Indeed, both he and his &s;on, in under&s;tanding and demeanour, give you an impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome|thing con&s;iderably above inn-keepers. He &s;hook his head at the idea of a mu&s;ical entertainment at COLCHESTER&mdash;but, as the a&s;&s;embly-room was in his hou&s;e, I re&s;olved to try it. My &s;ucce&s;s turned out neither good nor bad, and he and I &s;ettled the matter as men &s;hould do who mean fairly by each other. One circum&s;tance, however, rendered my jaunt to COLCHESTER very plea&s;urable. A gentleman, who has every thing within him&s;elf that can con|&s;titute the enjoyments of a country-life in the true&s;t and mo&s;t delectable &s;tile, laid him&s;elf out, with the unaffected and hearty kindne&s;s of old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality, to charm away every moment of my time. Were I to mention every particular of his flattering partiality in terms it de&s;erves, I mu&s;t invent
<PB N="81" REF="88">
new ones&mdash;as no idea but the kind attention of this gentleman, and the be|nevolence of his family of love engro&s;&s;ed me&mdash;I &s;hall only &s;ay of COLCHES|TER&mdash;that the applau&s;e was exce&s;&s;ive&mdash;the profit &s;carcely any thing.</P>
<P>On my return to IPSWICH, my night was &s;poiled by the intervention of that little pique which I have &s;o fully mentioned in my la&s;t letter. I there|fore got away to BURY ST. EDMUNDS, at which place, as I pa&s;&s;ed through in my way to IPSWICH&mdash;as the players call it&mdash;I <HI>took the town</HI>; that is to &s;ay, made my enquiries, and &s;aw how the land lay. Before I &s;it my&s;elf down at BURY, I &s;hall &s;peak of &s;ome characters at IPSWICH. Among the foremo&s;t, I anxiou&s;ly &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity in my life of noticing two members of the law of liberal and gentlemanlike manners&mdash;and, that &s;o extraordinary an event may be fully proclaimed, whether the&s;e gentlemen will or not&mdash;their names are Mr. KILDERBEE and Mr. SQUIRES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I a&s;&s;ure the reader I &s;hall have, in the cour&s;e of the work, more characters of this de&s;cription; and they &s;hall be placed among my catalogue of WONDERS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hionable and friendly Mr. TROTMAN certainly &s;trove to &s;erve me as indu&s;triou&s;ly as ever the BUSY BODY did to &s;erve Sir GEORGE AIRY; and, notwith&s;tanding, it has been &s;aid the la&s;t &s;torm was of his <HI>brewing,</HI> yet, I really would try my hand at his panegyrick, if my pen was not re&s;trained every time the idea comes acro&s;s me, by a recollection of the following lines in PRIOR.
<Q><L>"To John I owe great obligation&mdash;</L>
<L>"But John unhappily thought fit</L>
<L>"To publi&s;h it to all the nation:&mdash;</L>
<L>"Sure John and I are more than quit!"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89">Nor mu&s;t I forget that &s;on of LINNEAS, Dr. COYTE, who had&mdash;when he did me the honour to conduct me to his botanic plantation&mdash;arrived to &s;uch a pitch of perfection in improving upon nature, as to deprive the &s;un of the power of maturing a <HI>Magnolia</HI> for a whole fortnight, that it might bloom for the gratification of his friends in the race week. The father of this gen|tleman is &s;aid to have been one of the fir&s;t botani&s;ts in Europe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o &s;peak of another gentleman, who repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed a very &s;trong de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at my entertainment, but a foreigner&mdash;which too often happens&mdash;attracted him with &s;uch magnetic force, that in &s;pight of his own wi&s;hes, he had not the power to turn from the charm that fa&s;cinated him.</P>
<P>But la&s;t&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though not lea&s;t"</Q>&mdash;I &s;hall &s;peak of PUNCHARD and JERMYN, who&s;e kindne&s;s was fraught with &s;uch unaffected attention, that it will not ea&s;ily be era&s;ed from my remembrance. One thing, in particular, marked a &s;trong de&s;ire to plea&s;e, which is one of the be&s;t recommendations of a trade&s;|man; though heaven knows the trifle I paid them was &s;carcely worth an acknowledgment. The receipt was thus worded. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Received the contents of this bill&mdash;with thanks."</Q></P>
<P>I have before expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e that civility, being &s;o cheap an ac|commodation, &s;hould be &s;o little attended to. It is, indeed, &s;o winning, that it in&s;ures attention to the meane&s;t trifles. A good introduction does wonders; and though an in&s;inuating prologue cannot &s;ave a bad play, it may &s;often con&s;iderably the rigour of its &s;ate. Is not a fine lady cheated by a &s;hopkeeper with all the willingne&s;s in the world, if he compliments her per&s;on while he palms on her his damaged goods? Appearance&mdash;like the fir&s;t blow in boxing&mdash;is half the battle. What a figure would a judge look if he were to try a cau&s;e in a black bob wig and a pair of jack boots. I was once witne&s;s to a farmer's abu&s;ing a pair of young, &s;pruce, unwigged coun&s;ellors
<PB N="83" REF="90">
for &s;poiling his ground, in the afternoon, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he had&mdash;on a trial in the morning&mdash;trembled from head to foot. But to &s;ettle my account with COLCHESTER and IPSWICH.</P>
<P>Both of the&s;e places &s;eem to have been formerly of con&s;equence, but are now greatly declined. The manufactory of baize, as well as mo&s;t of our &s;taple commerce is getting north. A &s;tronger proof of which cannot be given than that LIVERPOOL is in&s;en&s;ibly drawing away the trade of BRISTOL, and HULL all the coa&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s, except YARMOUTH, from IPSWICH to SALTFLEET:&mdash;and thus it will be found inland. Manufactories that begin about the center of the kingdom, pu&s;h on to the north; till&mdash;having taken up their re&s;idence in York&s;hire&mdash;they expand to the ea&s;t and we&s;t; but par|ticularly the ea&s;t, in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing way. Thus, from LEEDS to LI|VERPOOL&mdash;through BRADFORD, HALIFAX, ROCHDALE, MANCHESTER, WARRINGTON, and PRESTON&mdash;the population is wonderful. The work|men are like &s;o many ants employed about their heaps; but they are &s;o dif|ferent from tho&s;e in London, that while the ants of the north labour for the <HI>general benefit,</HI> the other pi&s;mires work hard for the GENERAL CONFUSION.</P>
<P>As for the inns&mdash;the <HI>White Hart</HI> at COLCHESTER is one of the be&s;t in England. It is large, hand&s;ome, and convenient, and has admirable ac|commodations. I was witne&s;s to Mr. REYNOLD's &s;ending out&mdash;with &s;ome company who had been to pay a vi&s;it to Mr. RIGBY&mdash;two and twenty pair of hor&s;es in one morning. I cannot &s;o correctly &s;peak as to the inns of IPSWICH, for when I was there they were all in confu&s;ion, and it was fir&s;t come fir&s;t &s;erved. Provi&s;ion &s;eemed to be very good, and the &s;oles they get from ALD|BOROUGH are incomparable.</P>
<P>I acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and thank you for your re|marks. It is true I have yet &s;aid nothing of the country as to cultivation. It mu&s;t have been owing to a want of diver&s;ity in the &s;ubject. The face of
<PB N="84" REF="91">
nature, at the time I am recording, appeared to me like a &s;erene day, fair and full of &s;miles. The only change was from arable to meadow land, and from meadow to arable; and this you may di&s;tingui&s;h with your eyes &s;hut&mdash;for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ripe harve&s;t of the new-mown hay gave it a &s;weet and plea&s;ing odour."</Q></P>
<P>Pray do not fail to give me your &s;entiments fully, as I a&s;&s;ure you nothing can give me more plea&s;ure than the attention you are plea&s;ed to pay.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING &s;at my&s;elf down in a lodging at BURY, I paid my re&s;pects as u&s;ual to the <HI>commandant</HI>&mdash;who is there called THE AL|DERMAN&mdash;the re&s;t of the magi&s;tracy being twelve feoffees. This gentleman made not the &s;malle&s;t objection, except to the u&s;e of the Guildhall, which was a part of my reque&s;t, and this he could not, according to con&s;tant u&s;age, grant without the con&s;ent obtained in writing of the feoffees. I a&s;ked him which among them was the mo&s;t mu&s;ical, and he an&s;wered Dr. NORFORD; which intelligence was &s;o true, that having waited on that gentleman I found him &s;urrounded with friends who were li&s;tening to a morning concert. He came to me into the hall&mdash;and, upon hearing my name, in&s;i&s;ted on my entering the room, where the IPSWICH gentleman and the foreigner mentioned in my la&s;t letter made a part of the company. Some in&s;trumental things were per|formed, and I was at length reque&s;ted to play a le&s;&s;on on the <HI>piano forte.</HI> I felt all the di&s;advantage of having no <HI>foreign attraction,</HI> and therefore knew that I &s;tood but little chance of being ranked with my pre&s;ent competitors, un|le&s;s I could in &s;ome arch way turn the tables. I therefore &s;aid I thought a &s;ong would be a kind of relief to what had gone before, and played <HI>Pompo&s;o,</HI> which
<PB N="86" REF="93">
hit exactly as I wi&s;hed it &s;hould. This circum&s;tance&mdash;for you know I love il|lu&s;trations&mdash;brings another to my mind which al&s;o told very &s;trongly in this way.</P>
<P>I was a&s;ked to dine at one of Mr. Fox's annual meetings, were there were about two hundred We&s;tmin&s;ter electors. Before I gave my con&s;ent, I &s;tipulated with my friend that I &s;hould not be a&s;ked to &s;ing. This indulgence he &s;aid he could in&s;ure me; but, upon reflection, I placed very little reliance on the promi&s;e. I therefore was prepared with my famous <HI>Jew's &s;ong,</HI> which will be found in <HI>The Readings</HI>; and it is not in the power of language to de|&s;cribe how wonderfully well it hit. That &s;ine veteran, MACKLIN, was in raptures, and I &s;incerely believe it was the &s;ole cau&s;e of his burning his wig, which made &s;uch a noi&s;e the next day in the new&s;papers. But to return to BURY.</P>
<P>The con&s;ent I wanted was ea&s;ily obtained&mdash;and in my life I never expe|rienced hand&s;omer or politer treatment. One reverend gentleman however was &s;crupulous&mdash;but it is a becoming thing for the clergy to be con&s;ciencious&mdash;and though the Rev. Dr. WOOLASTON's readine&s;s to forward a rational amu&s;e|ment, which he did me the honour to attend and highly approve, had certainly nothing reprehen&s;ible in it, the other reverend doctor was &s;urely under no obli|gation to do the &s;ame. 'Tis true, if others had imitated this wonderfully &s;aga|cious, prudent, and wary foreca&s;t, BURY would have been deprived of what they were &s;o kind as to think a plea&s;ure. What then! Prevention is a wi&s;e thing; and upon the &s;ame principle&mdash;a little more rigidly exacted to be &s;ure&mdash;that it is better to let <HI>twenty</HI> guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape, than that <HI>one</HI> &s;uffer inno|cently&mdash;&s;o the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of fifty harmle&s;s amu&s;ements is meritorious, rather than run the &s;malle&s;t ri&s;k of giving encouragement to vice and immorality.</P>
<P>After the performance was over&mdash;which I had adverti&s;ed but for one night&mdash;I was obliged to promi&s;e a repetition of it; and as I wi&s;hed very much to go
<PB N="87" REF="94">
to NORWICH before the players could get there, I appointed a late day in the following week, and packed off. I have really had the luck of meeting with friendly printers. Mr. STEVENSON, the valuable and worthy partner of Mr. CROUSE, &s;hewed me a thou&s;and civilities. Among the re&s;t, his friendly re|commendation to YARMOUTH, rubbed off all difficulties in the way of my performing there&mdash;yet would it be inju&s;tice to Me&s;&s;rs. DOWNES and MARCH, not to &s;ay that their attention for the &s;hort time I remained at YARMOUTH, was very gentlemanlike and perfectly liberal. But let me fir&s;t &s;peak of NORWICH. On the fir&s;t night&mdash;though I addre&s;&s;ed upwards of an hundred letters to the principal people&mdash;I had only five per&s;ons. I did not perform, in cour&s;e; and indeed I was doubtful whether I &s;hould give them the trouble, or my&s;elf the expence of another night. Having however under&s;tood that I was there al&s;o con&s;idered as an impo&s;tor, I in&s;erted a paragraph in the bill which I expected would have its effect; and indeed I was &s;timulated to this by the very hand&s;ome conduct of a gentleman pre&s;ent on the fir&s;t night, who &s;aid every thing he could think of to palliate the matter. I drove him however into a corner, by &s;aying that I was very willing to &s;tand or fall by the merit of the entertain|ment, and it would give me particular plea&s;ure if they would pitch upon twelve critics, who &s;hould be men of real under&s;tanding, to report the matter, and let it be decided upon according to their judgment. He an&s;wered that it was a fair offer, but that it never could be &s;ettled, for there was not any &s;uch num|ber as twelve critics in NORWICH. At the &s;ame time he &s;ugge&s;ted that the &s;ucce&s;s might be better&mdash;that the number of nights I had adverti&s;ed, I ought to con&s;ider as a compact with the public. This la&s;t argument rou&s;ed me. I determined to perform every night I had engaged for, at all adventures. I did &s;o; and though no opportunity was neglected, and tho&s;e who attended were greatly plea&s;ed&mdash;according to the Iri&s;hman&mdash;<HI>I gained a lo&s;s.</HI> Enough therefore of NORWICH; at which place however&mdash;as at almo&s;t every other&mdash;I found &s;omething to counterbalance my di&s;appointments. The attention and civility of my friend STEVENSON, made me large amends for the vapid, un|meaning languor that pervaded the place it&s;elf; not but I have many acknow|ledgments
<PB N="88" REF="95">
to pay tho&s;e who attended the performance&mdash;for they one and all agreed that I could not, in painting my TOUR, throw NORWICH too much into the back ground.</P>
<P>At YARMOUTH I had two nights, which&mdash;though not <HI>numerous</HI>&mdash;were <HI>brilliant.</HI> There is a gentleman at YARMOUTH, to whom the fa&s;hionable people look up&mdash;and well they may&mdash;as the arbiter of their amu&s;ements. His attention to me&mdash;could I conceive I really merited it&mdash;might make me vain of my&s;elf indeed. To &s;hew however that nothing can win me on a pecuniary &s;core, be it known, I rather lo&s;t than gained at YARMOUTH. But Dr. COO|PER's anxiety on that account&mdash;his &s;olicitude for my accommodation&mdash;his hand&s;ome, well-bred conduct, gave me &s;o exalted an opinion of him, that I was not at all &s;urpri&s;ed when Mr. ROUPE (to whom he is a &s;ort of patron without his own knowledge&mdash;for he confers to oblige him&s;elf) a&s;&s;ured me that there is not a human mind fraught with more worth or di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence. And here Mr. ROUPE mu&s;t forgive me, if in order to illu&s;trate his and my po&s;ition, I &s;peak a little of his own comfortable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This gentleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a competent fortune, &s;ubject to alienation at the death of a relation&mdash;which relation being dead, he is deprived of it till the de|cea&s;e of another. Upon his lo&s;s, by the advice of his friends&mdash;and Dr. COO|PER at the head of them, he made what had been his amu&s;ement his profe&s;&s;ion, and having an admirable mu&s;ical turn, he is now organi&s;t, and has all the prin|cipal teaching of YARMOUTH. I never had the plea&s;ure of hearing him play, but have heard a great account of his performance. I however chatted with him &s;ome hours on mu&s;ic, and he &s;eems to be of my own &s;entiments. He has a &s;trong fancy, and de&s;pi&s;es every <HI>rule</HI> that is not reconcileable to REASON.&mdash;May he long be happy! which there is little fear of; for through the benig|nant influence of Dr. COOPER, and his own mild and amiable manners, he feels him&s;elf as independent, and is as much re&s;pected, as when he ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine of fortune, and had no right to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a profe&s;&s;ional man.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96">You mu&s;t under&s;tand that I performed at NORWICH and YARMOUTH alternately&mdash;which circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned the appearance of a paragraph in the BURY paper, &s;aying, that it was a wonderful thing&mdash;&s;etting a&s;ide all con|&s;iderations of the merit of the performance&mdash;that Mr. DIBDIN &s;hould be able <HI>at all</HI> to perform an amu&s;ement in which he &s;ung twenty four &s;ongs, and de|livered an adequate quantity of &s;peaking, on <HI>Monday</HI> at NORWICH&mdash;<HI>Tue&s;day</HI> at YARMOUTH&mdash;<HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> at NORWICH&mdash;<HI>Thur&s;day</HI> at YARMOUTH&mdash;<HI>Friday</HI> at NORWICH&mdash;and <HI>Saturday</HI> at BURY. This circum&s;tance however would have been attended with more plea&s;urable con&s;equences to me, if every one of the&s;e nights had been equal to the la&s;t, which I &s;eriou&s;ly declare was more than the other five put together.</P>
<P>NORWICH is a large city&mdash;but the &s;treets are &s;o narrow and &s;o alike, that a man would &s;ooner learn to be his own pilot in LONDON than in that place. There are &s;o <HI>few &s;pires</HI> in NORWICH, that the view of the town and cathedral from the YARMOUTH road acro&s;s the river, has a mo&s;t beautiful and pictu|re&s;que effect. Not &s;o very &s;triking as that bird's-eye-view of BRISTOL, from <HI>Cliffden Hill,</HI> but neat and well grouped. The &s;treets of YARMOUTH are yet narrower than tho&s;e of NORWICH, but the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Quay</HI> makes hand&s;ome amends. The fir&s;t has all the heavy &s;tupidity of a city where the manufactory is on the decline, and the other the &s;prightline&s;s of increa&s;ing trade, varied by an influx of commodities from every part of the world. I never beheld &s;uch a wonderful &s;cene as the prodigious fine, large, rich fields of corn exhibited for a &s;tretch of eight miles together, between NORWICH and YARMOUTH&mdash;and yet go where you would the farmers grumbled; but it has been well ob&s;erved, that Engli&s;hmen are never rolling in wealth &s;o much as when they complain of the weight of taxes, and the impending ruin of the nation.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT my return from NORWICH to BURY, which was on the la&s;t day of the a&s;&s;ize week,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saturday, July 28.</NOTE> I found every thing prepared for my performance, at which a very &s;plendid audience attended, and among them one of the learned judges. The applau&s;e was prodigious, and never did better humour prevail in an a&s;&s;embly. I felt my&s;elf however rather awkward at having announced the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wolf who had been a lawyer."</Q> I intimated this ridi|culous di&s;tre&s;s to a gentleman who &s;at near me, and the &s;ubject &s;o got about that no member of the law went uncon&s;ulted, and it was re&s;olved <HI>nem. con.</HI> that I &s;hould cut at the lawyers. You will find the pa&s;&s;age in <HI>The Readings.</HI> My feelings however were too prophetic; for though many of the gentlemen&mdash;particularly him I con&s;ulted, and the judge&mdash;enjoyed the &s;atire, yet were there many chop-fallen on the occa&s;ion. I mention this circum&s;tance to &s;up|port that con&s;tant opinion I have ever broached, that in the practice of the law there are &s;o many temptations to knavery, that every lawyer who does not feel a &s;everity of this kind as a po&s;itive reproach to him&s;elf, mu&s;t be hurt at having been bred up to a profe&s;&s;ion that &s;tigmatizes nine-tenths of his brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98">On Sunday I &s;et out for WORCESTER, and on the following Tue&s;day arrived there. I have mentioned that before I left this place, I made a promi&s;e to return to it, and I now put my&s;elf to the expence of travelling po&s;t one hundred and forty-nine miles to keep my word. Having at BURY purcha&s;ed Mr. PATERSON's Travelling Dictionary, I &s;hall now begin to point out a few of its errors. He &s;ays from BURY to WORCESTER is 138 miles; and his mi&s;take originates from calling it 15 miles from AULCESTER to WORCESTER, whereas it is 23. From AULCESTER to DROITWICH is 14, and from thence to WORCESTER 9. He is wrong a &s;ingle mile in three other places, which makes the di&s;tance in all 149 miles from BURY to WORCESTER.</P>
<P>My going this long journey was the more inconvenient, having received a letter at BURY, telling me that a gentleman at HULL and BEVERLY could accommodate me with a room, and had no doubt of my doing extremely well at tho&s;e towns&mdash;but of the&s;e places in their turn. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find a much colder reception at WORCESTER than formerly. Except from one or two friends, I never experienced more <HI>milk and water</HI> treatment in my life. I adverti&s;ed my entertainment however and was tolerably attended. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Very tolerably,</HI>"</Q> as Te&s;ter &s;ays, and I &s;incerely believe, had it not been for the interference of a friend, I mu&s;t have u&s;ed the word INTOLERABLY. To this gentleman, who is no other than T. S. E&s;q. I &s;hall beg leave to &s;ay, that if he meant his friend&s;hip and attention to my intere&s;t &s;hould fini&s;h where it ap|parently has&mdash;God forbid I &s;hould load him with more trouble than he is will|ing to &s;uffer! So far from it&mdash;I here, in the face of the world, acquit him of any intentions in relation to me, but tho&s;e of &s;erving, obliging, and plea&s;ing me; and &s;hould it &s;o happen that neither upon paper, nor any other way, we again exchange a &s;ingle word, my wi&s;hes towards him are, may he enjoy a long life of health, happine&s;s, and pro&s;perity! And I hope he retains &s;o much of his former good wi&s;hes for me, as to return an equal portion of e&s;teem, with equal &s;incerity.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99">My &s;ucce&s;s at WORCESTER was little worth the pains I took to get at it. Dr. EVANS, the <HI>archdeacon,</HI> who was very partial to the entertainment, &s;aid my reception was a reproach to the place; and really as they diverted my cour&s;e in a mo&s;t expen&s;ive and inconvenient way, it would have been but hand&s;ome to have let me known in time that they had changed their mind, or have paid me &s;ome attention when I did come. I will not quit this &s;ubject without &s;peaking of that friendly and goodnatured creature Mr. SMART, who I &s;incerely believe was as anxious for my &s;ucce&s;s as my&s;elf. Nor mu&s;t I leave DIGLEY un&s;ung&mdash;the heartine&s;s of Mr. PEACH its owner&mdash;nor the beauties of that charming place, watered by the Severn, and bounded with a view of <HI>Malvern-hills.</HI> Mr. SHENSTONE would pre&s;ently have knocked you off half a dozen &s;tanzas on this &s;ubject; wherein he would have told you in ver&s;e that goes <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"trippingly o'er the tongue,"</Q> that the hills are blue at a di&s;tance, more di&s;tinct when near&mdash;that the river has the property of reflection, and that you may &s;ee in it imperfect trees &s;tanding on their heads&mdash;with many more poetically &s;elf-evident images. I once parodied <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My banks are all furni&s;h'd with bees."</Q> The fir&s;t ver&s;e ran thus:
<Q><LG>
<L>My banks are all furni&s;h'd with bees,</L>
<L><HI>Quick&s;et Hedges</HI> my <HI>fences</HI> adorn,</L>
<L>My <HI>woods</HI> are all crowded with <HI>trees,</HI></L>
<L>And my <HI>fields</HI> yellow over with <HI>corn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I &s;eldom have found any <HI>tares,</HI></L>
<L>Of &s;uch u&s;e are my <HI>harrow</HI> and <HI>plough</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>In my <HI>orchards</HI> grow <HI>apples</HI> and <HI>pears,</HI></L>
<L>In my <HI>dairy</HI> there's <HI>milk from the cow.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>In this manner one might, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, run on, without any great &s;tretch of difficulty, till all the wonderful variety in the whole round of rural objects were enumerated.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I recollect &s;omething like the following, in a French author, though I cannot at this moment tell who. An old fellow is buying an e&s;tate, and the &s;eller puffs it off in all the flowery, de&s;criptive extravagance of an auctioneer's adverti&s;ement. To which this is the an&s;wer. 'Tis in ver&s;e, and I have imitated it.
<Q><L>"If for &s;even years you were to chatter,</L>

<L>"All have their whims, and to tell mine t'ye,</L>
<L>"<HI>One</HI> country &s;een&mdash;one has &s;een <HI>ninety.</HI></L></Q></NOTE> Yet&mdash;let me not be profane&mdash;SHENSTONE's
<PB N="93" REF="100">
eclogues and many other of his things have great poetic &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;but, hav|ing an inveterate aver&s;ion to in&s;ipidity, I never could feel any other &s;en&s;ation than drow&s;ine&s;s at that famous ballad which is &s;aid to contain all the beauties of pa&s;toral poetry. But this will always be the way&mdash;the generality of man|kind give an author credit for what, in all probability, he con&s;idered in the light of an in&s;ignificant trifle&mdash;&s;uch as the ballad above-mentioned&mdash;while his higher-fini&s;hed and more beautiful works&mdash;&s;uch as the &s;chool mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;is little known, and le&s;s ta&s;ted. But there is always this comfort:&mdash;men of real ta&s;te will &s;eparate the gold from the alloy, the applau&s;e of one of whom will outweigh a whole crowd of inferior critics.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not quit WORCESTER without mentioning a mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary in&s;tance of the fal&s;ity of that vulgar po&s;ition&mdash;that fortune is inattentive to virtue. There is a gentleman I would name if I did not fear to wound his well known mode&s;ty, who made his fortune by the exerci&s;e of that one &s;ingle virtue&mdash;<HI>forbearance,</HI> I do not mean that he has not all the re&s;t in as great perfection&mdash;but this happened to be put mo&s;t to the trial. And, to &s;hew that I am determined, whenever I have an opportunity, to celebrate the virtues of profe&s;&s;ional men with the &s;ame willingne&s;s as any other de|&s;cription, this gentleman was originally nothing el&s;e than a mu&s;ician&mdash;a mere thrummer of wire, and a &s;craper of catgut. He taught a young lady who fell in love with him, and even went &s;o far as to propo&s;e an elopement. Did he, think you, give way to the tender impul&s;e, and, while his heart beat high, &s;natch &s;weet occa&s;ion, and become happy! No &s;uch thing. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh fie

Having fini&s;hed this laconic re|proach, he left the di&s;appointed, love&s;ick fair one, and &s;ought her father&mdash;when&mdash;fir&s;t &s;tipulating that the young lady &s;hould not be ill treated&mdash;he mi|nutely acquainted him. To do which, it &s;eems, he was obliged to relate a tale that might be called the hi&s;tory of the Sabines inverted, with his daugh|ter's &s;hocking violation of her duty. What was the con&s;equence? This amiable young man's unheard-of prudence &s;aved the family; the daughter became prudent, by de&s;pi&s;ing the man &s;he had courted; was married &s;oon after to one of equal birth, and I hope equal impetuo&s;ity; the father pru|dently rewarded the author of his dome&s;tic happine&s;s; and that author prudently put the reward in his pocket. After this, our mu&s;ical Jo&s;eph fell in love him&s;elf&mdash;but, with his u&s;ual patience and forbearance, he de|termined that time alone &s;hould prove whether the object of his affection was worthy of it. The lady, however, being a little in the &s;tile of the other&mdash;not quite of that pa&s;&s;ive temper which contents it&s;elf with <HI>imaginary</HI> bli&s;s&mdash;was fir&s;t unea&s;y&mdash;afterwards <HI>unhappy</HI>&mdash;then ILL&mdash;and at length DIED.&mdash;Our mirror of prudence, having lo&s;t a fortune by her, had nothing for it but to con&s;ole the mamma. He con&s;idered him&s;elf as her &s;on&mdash;&s;he con&s;i|dered her&s;elf as his mother&mdash;and, that nothing might be left undone to con|firm this ideal con&s;anguinity, &s;he died, and left him all &s;he was worth&mdash;which turned out to be no trifle.</P>
<P>Is there a fortune-hunter, who reads this, but will, in future, change his battery&mdash;and cea&s;e to tear forward children from the arms of indulgent parents; &s;ince&mdash;by imitating the excellent example before them&mdash;the fortune&mdash;which is always the object&mdash;may be gained without the lo&s;s of honour, or&mdash;which is a more material con&s;ideration&mdash;the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wife?</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM WORCESTER&mdash;having been joined by an intimate and valuable friend&mdash;I &s;teered my cour&s;e, on the eleventh of Augu&s;t, for GLOUCESTER, BRISTOL, and MONMOUTH; my plan&mdash;while he &s;hould remain with me&mdash;being, to make the matter a mutual intercour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and call at tho&s;e places that might be mo&s;t convenient to both. Nothing in <HI>my</HI> way was to be done at GLOUCESTER&mdash;for though the gloom of the bankruptcies before mentioned was worn off, yet the place looked as melan|choly as ever; we therefore proceeded to BRISTOL, &s;pent three or four happy days with my friend BOYTON, and pa&s;&s;ed on from thence to MONMOUTH, being the fir&s;t place where I intended to di&s;play my &s;tandard.</P>
<P>The current account of places remains un&s;ettled ever &s;ince NORWICH. BURY, which is the picture of cheerfulne&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;together with its vici|nity&mdash;of people who &s;eem determined to be happy. The &s;eats of Mr. SY|MONDS, Sir CHARLES BUNBURY, Sir CHARLES DAVERS, and many others, mo&s;t charmingly enliven every morning ride; and its proximity to NEW|MARKET
<PB N="97" REF="104">
occa&s;ions frequent vi&s;its from many people of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. The corn-market alone gives you a very re&s;pectable idea of the place. Of the inns, the <HI>Bell</HI> is a remarkable good one&mdash;if civility, good cheer, and a rea&s;onable charge are the right di&s;tinctions. If you would meet with the rever&s;e in every re&s;pect go to the <HI>Angel.</HI></P>
<P>My journey from BURY to WORCESTER, was performed in &s;o &s;hort a time, that it would be a farce to talk of making any material ob&s;ervations. The roads are charming from CAMBRIDGE to WILLINGBOROUGH, and then very indifferent till you get four miles beyond WARWICK, in the way to STRATFORD-UPON-AVON; afterwards they are good all the way to WOR|CESTER. I promi&s;ed to &s;peak of the <HI>White Lion</HI> at STRATFORD, and com|mon ju&s;tice obliges me to &s;ay, that the in&s;olence of the people who keep it exceeds all example. I &s;hould pa&s;s by the contempt with which they treat travellers in a &s;tage coach&mdash;which is hard, by the way, for they mu&s;t go there or nowhere&mdash;and al&s;o their wanting to put me into a return chai&s;e, and make me pay full price for it. All this is in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s. But when you are in a hurry to have the very wor&s;t hor&s;es picked out, and be told <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the others are for your betters, and you may have them or none"</Q>&mdash;though they do not know you&mdash;and, if they did, your betters do not pay a farthing more&mdash;is a &s;pecies of contemptuous impudence that I hope will, by &s;omebody more competent than my&s;elf, be taken down. I have a great deal more of this &s;ort of conduct to complain of, and I &s;hall &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;e the re&s;pectable inhabitants of capital towns&mdash;for at STRATFORD I know not if it would be worth while&mdash;for their own private benefit, for the benefit of tho&s;e who in vi&s;its of bu&s;ine&s;s to them, pamper the pride and fatten the&s;e in&s;uffer|able inn-keepers, and for the benefit of the public in general, to imitate the &s;pirit of the DUKE OF NORFOLK, and as completely curb the haughty im|pertinence of the&s;e &s;ervants out of livery&mdash;which in general they are&mdash;as he has&mdash;as far as its influence extends&mdash;by building the <HI>Tontine,</HI> at SHEFFIELD, and placing in it a man who&s;e &s;olicitude for the convenience of his gue&s;ts
<PB N="98" REF="105">
&s;hould be quoted as a precedent for every one in his &s;ituation. The ground from WORCESTER to BRISTOL I have gone over already. I promi&s;ed, on my return, to give an account of the mu&s;ical ta&s;te of BRISTOL&mdash;but, upon the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, I do not find they have any at all. The road is all the way delightful, and from TEWKSBURY to GLOUCESTER remarkably &s;o. It wanted nothing but a few &s;cattered Romi&s;h chapels to have fini&s;hed &s;ubjects for the pencil of CLAUDE. From BRISTOL we cro&s;&s;ed the Severn, in a dung barge, and proceeded to CHEPSTOW&mdash;where we were offered our choice either to &s;tay, or have four hor&s;es to take us on; and all this becau&s;e the landlord of the other inn was ju&s;t become a bankrupt. Let me caution all travellers to make any &s;hift rather than &s;ubmit to be drawn by four hor&s;es. They make no more expedition than two&mdash;and, exclu&s;ive of the expence in them&s;elves, po&s;tillions, o&s;tlers, and turnpikes, you have a great deal of difficulty to &s;hake them off again, and your bill is in proportion to your <HI>oetelage.</HI> The&s;e four hor&s;es brought us very &s;lowly&mdash;for which I was obliged to them&mdash;over one of the mo&s;t uncommonly beautiful hills that can be imagined&mdash;the whole country every where abundantly rich with corn&mdash;to MONMOUTH; where, for the pre|&s;ent, I &s;hall bid you adieu&mdash;a&s;&s;uring you that I am ever,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONMOUTH was not worth a printer. To make my intentions known, therefore, was a matter of no &s;mall difficulty. A few re&s;pectful letters, however, to the principal inhabitants of the town and its vicinity, did the bu&s;ine&s;s pretty well, and I was tolerably attended a fir&s;t night (Augu&s;t 17) and much better a &s;econd; and, as a general good humour and inclination to receive plea&s;ure was the predominant &s;en&s;ation, I felt almo&s;t as happy as if the advantage had been equal to the applau&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s by &s;ome particular civilities that I received at MON|MOUTH. The Rev. Dr. DAVIS, who was then the <HI>Mayor,</HI> paid me very great attention; and&mdash;what made it more welcome to me&mdash;it was very much in the &s;tile of Dr. COOPER, of YARMOUTH. For this kindne&s;s I then re|que&s;ted him privately&mdash;and do now publicly&mdash;to receive my thanks. Nor will I have the ingratitude to forget the anxious heartine&s;s of my good friend OWEN TUDOR, the book&s;eller, who, though not a <HI>printer,</HI> was &s;o good a <HI>publi&s;her</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, that much more intelligence was received thro' his kind a&s;&s;iduity, than I am &s;ure would have been conveyed by means of hand bills. I left him&mdash;and may he long continue &s;o&mdash;comfortable in him&s;elf,
<PB N="100" REF="107">
beloved by his neighbours, and &s;urrounded by that be&s;t of happine&s;s&mdash;dome&s;|tic felicity. In fine, I gave and received great &s;atisfaction at MONMOUTH; but, as it is the lot of human beings to do nothing perfect, I under&s;tand there is one gentleman for who&s;e ca&s;tigation I was &s;uppo&s;ed to have written the bu&s;ine&s;s of inventing quotations. Nay, &s;ome went &s;o far as to &s;ay, he will never be able to <HI>invent</HI> another <HI>undoubted</HI> fact as long as he lives. If this be the ca&s;e, how unfortunate am I in having deprived a good &s;tory-teller of the greate&s;t embelli&s;hment his talents can derive advantage from. Should it be &s;o, I can only &s;ay&mdash;which I entreat the gentleman, if he read this, to believe&mdash;that it was written many months before I had the plea&s;ure of his company at my readings, and always highly approved as a <HI>devili&s;h good thing.</HI></P>
<P>From MONMOUTH&mdash;which, though an <HI>ancient</HI> town, is a very <HI>&s;prightly</HI> one&mdash;ju&s;t as a rea&s;onable old man (MACKLIN for in&s;tance) in &s;pight of his years, re&s;olves to be merry&mdash;we jogged on to <HI>&s;tupid</HI> HEREFORD. I have made this remark in my TOUR, that the cities in general&mdash;as I &s;ay of the Dominos&mdash;are <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"grave, elegant, genteel, and&mdash;<HI>&s;tupid</HI>;"</Q> to which if I was to add poor and proud, the phra&s;e I think would apply pretty well. For if we except BRISTOL, which, being a &s;ea-port, is naturally a bu&s;y and indu&s;trious place&mdash;WORCESTER, which has a manufactory for gloves and porcelain&mdash;tho' both are on the decline&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any thing &s;o phlegmatic and in&s;en&s;ible as are the re&s;t of the cities I have &s;een. Thus &s;hall I always &s;ay <HI>&s;tupid</HI> HEREFORD, <HI>melancholy</HI> LICHFIELD, <HI>pitiful</HI> LINCOLN, and <HI>frothy</HI> YORK. This la&s;t place, however, being the LONDON of the <HI>North,</HI> has ex|actly as much of it as a <HI>&s;hadow</HI> has of a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI>; and, upon the &s;trength of this, it pre&s;umes to be courtly, and make promi&s;es, which&mdash;like the non|&s;en&s;e of a Frenchman&mdash;are PLEASING, and <HI>mean nothing.</HI> They buoy you up like an air jacket, but the &s;malle&s;t inlet&mdash;even a &s;ingle pin hole&mdash;can evapo|rate the air, and down you go. They will take care to promi&s;e nothing

but trifles, and even tho&s;e they take as good care not to keep.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my mind an anecdote of a POOR PLAYER, who had run up an ale-hou&s;e &s;core to the enormous extent of <HI>two &s;hillings,</HI> for which he had been &s;o often dunned that he kept away from the hou&s;e. One day meeting the LANDLORD, and being clo&s;ely importuned to &s;atisfy him, this &s;troll|ing ROSCIUS a&s;&s;ured him that he might depend, in the cour&s;e of the week, on being paid in &s;ome &s;hape or another&mdash;Shape!&mdash;&s;aid the LANDLORD&mdash;well, I think I'll take your word this time, but&mdash;harkee!&mdash;pray let it be as much in the &s;hape of&mdash;<HI>two &s;hillings as you can.</HI></NOTE> I am, how|ever, not yet at YORK, therefore I may as well keep what I have to &s;ay of that place till I get there. I &s;hall neverthele&s;s &s;o far digre&s;s as to fini&s;h my remarks on cities.</P>
<P>Some have averred that this vapidne&s;s is owing to the Cathedral, which nurtures &s;o many <HI>drones</HI> as to make all the re&s;t of the hive lazy. I hope this a&s;&s;ertion is more invidious than true. I have, literally &s;peaking, had no op|portunity, at the four places above mentioned, of taking per&s;onal cognizance of this fact. At HEREFORD I did not perform; or if I had, their cathedral had ju&s;t tumbled down, and of cour&s;e&mdash;like rats, which never fail to leave a &s;inking &s;hip&mdash;the black gentlemen were &s;heltered in &s;ome &s;afer a&s;ylum. I could not refrain from remarking, that though the <HI>church</HI> lay in ruins, the <HI>chapter-hou&s;e</HI> &s;tood &s;miling at the danger&mdash;all the rent-rolls, tythes and commutations were &s;afe:&mdash;as &s;afe as the iron che&s;t of a mi&s;er who has in&s;ured his hou&s;e&mdash;which de|fies the &s;preading flames, and keeps its &s;terling value in &s;ecurity, though bu|ried under a load of rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>At LICHFIELD they were providentially repairing their cathedral, le&s;t, unable to bear the ravages of time, it &s;hould al&s;o tumble down&mdash;the clergy therefore were again ab&s;ent upon furlough.</P>
<P>At LINCOLN indeed, where the cathedral &s;eems to have the &s;tability of a rock, and yet the lightne&s;s of a temple built with cards, the clerical gentlemen &s;eemed to be on full duty. And here, though nothing but my compact to
<PB N="102" REF="109">
&s;peak the truth &s;hould force it from me, I cannot help &s;aying that the above re|mark obtained a little&mdash;but this I &s;hall &s;peak to particularly when I arrive at LINCOLN.</P>
<P>At YORK, who&s;e &s;tately and maje&s;tic min&s;ter looks magnificently &s;tupen|dous at a di&s;tance, and when you are near it as petite as the Lord's prayer, the creed, and ten commandments &s;tuffed into a walnut &s;hell. I know nothing more of the clergy, than that their &s;ituations are generally &s;inecures, and that whether their cathedral &s;tand or fall&mdash;which latter there is no great probabi|lity of&mdash;they may be ab&s;ent when they plea&s;e. I know however a prebend of YORK whom my heart warms to think of. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>As to NORWICH, di&s;gu&s;t was my predominant pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore, like the father who would not di&s;inherit his &s;on becau&s;e he was angry with him, I will pa&s;s by that &s;ubject. I &s;hall al&s;o for the pre&s;ent have done with all other conjectures concerning the clergy; and content my&s;elf with offering my own ob&s;ervations relative to cities, which are, that having in general no manufactory or other public object to engro&s;s their attention, they are divided into people of tolerable fortunes, &s;mall fortunes, a few adventurers&mdash;by way of <HI>Cicesbeos</HI> to the wives and gallants to the daughters&mdash;and the remainder are &s;uch trade&s;men as furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and pick up a livelihood by the expenditure of the money circulated by tho&s;e before de&s;cribed. The attor|nies and medical gentlemen are in number according to the &s;ize of the place. A tolerable large city will maintain you&mdash;about thirty of the fir&s;t, and fifteen of the latter: &s;o much dearer in this country is property than health.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dearer paid for.&mdash;In every trifling village there are three or four decent hou&s;es, which you may be a&s;&s;ured belong to the par&s;on, the apothecary, and the lawyer.&mdash;It has been a remark that when one LAWYER cannot live in a place&mdash;<HI>two</HI> CAN; for in that ca&s;e, if the people are peaceably di&s;po&s;ed, one can <HI>provoke,</HI> and the other <HI>palliate.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Over all the&s;e, of cour&s;e, are placed the clergy, who can certainly give
<PB N="103" REF="110">
a &s;ort of <HI>Ton</HI> to the place; and if they ever happen&mdash;which all the world knows is very rare&mdash;either to be ignorant, overbearing, or void of ta&s;te, the&s;e pe|culiar qualities will be as &s;urely predominant in their influence on the re&s;t&mdash;<HI>and indeed ought,</HI> even as the whi&s;tle of the &s;hepherd brings the &s;heep into the fold.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee how I throw my ideas about at random, which indeed is all that can be expected of me; for manners and men can no more be deve|loped by a cur&s;ory view, than can a &s;ingle glance determine the colour of a <HI>cameleon</HI>&mdash;which mu&s;t have &s;hade and &s;un&s;hine, night and day, and every other adventitious opportunity, to di&s;play its different hues; and after all, &s;o blind is human judgment, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to fix on that particular &s;hade that is proper to it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All is not gold that glitters,"</Q> &s;ays the proverb.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;k me when I mean to &s;peak of mu&s;ic; and hint that my ob&s;ervations on poetry, painting, the theatre, and other matters, might be well intermingled with the narrative of my TOUR. I thank you for &s;aying exactly what you feel, as you read my remarks. I have not been unmindful of any of the&s;e &s;ubjects; but I &s;hall have &s;o much loo&s;e ground to run over for three or four letters to come, that I would willingly &s;hake it off my heels, before I come into the company of men of &s;cience and genius. In &s;hort, I &s;hall not begin my critical attack till I get farther on my journey; for, to give you a pun in the place of a better phra&s;e, one cannot be too far <HI>north</HI> for them.</P>
<P>From HEREFORD I went to LEOMINSTER, where I was told the inha|bitants were very anxious to &s;ee me. Mr. PENE, the organi&s;t&mdash;to who&s;e civi|lity I am greatly indebted&mdash;took much pains for me, previous to my arrival, and I had one very decent night. The old &s;tupid objection however took place. I was an impo&s;tor&mdash;and my performance was to be watched very nar|rowly:&mdash;my audience were &s;o much entertained however that they encored nine &s;ongs.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">Neverthele&s;s Mr. EVANS, a <HI>clergyman,</HI> propo&s;ed to Mr. GEARY, a <HI>&s;urgeon,</HI> a bet of ten guineas that I was an impo&s;tor. The wager was accepted, and Mr. KIRKMAN, a <HI>country '&s;quire,</HI> was to decide between them. This la&s;t menti|oned gentleman very gravely determined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that to be &s;ure of all the impo&s;tors that ever lived, I was the clevere&s;t&mdash;but that certainly I was not Mr. DIB|DIN, whom he knew perfectly well&mdash;that not long before he had been <HI>pub|licly</HI> in his company, and heard him &s;ing &s;everal jolly &s;ongs&mdash;and that he was <HI>a tall, thin man,</HI> and <HI>wore a wig.</HI>"</Q> Mr. GEARY having lo&s;t his wager, query whether he &s;hould not have appealed to me as a court of equity; or in|deed when this TOUR &s;hall come out, may it not be con&s;idered &s;uch &s;trong, legal evidence as may entitle Mr. GEARY to the recovery of his money&mdash;nay more, to a remedy through the medium of that act which makes it felony to obtain money by fal&s;e pretences; for it was certainly a fal&s;e pretence in Mr. KIRKMAN to &s;ay he had been publicly in my company. Had it &s;o happened, I mu&s;t have known it&mdash;for his per&s;on could not have been mi&s;taken, being remarkably like a ninepin with the addition of &s;ins. The&s;e premi&s;es therefore duly weighed and con&s;idered, I would advi&s;e Mr. EVANS to refund the mo|ney, and Mr. KIRKMAN to give a hand&s;ome treat&mdash;which he &s;eems very fond of&mdash;and pledge him&s;elf over the fir&s;t pint bumper, never&mdash;in imitation of the long-eared gentlemen&mdash;to de&s;cribe the <HI>roaring of a lion,</HI> le&s;t, by exerting his own voice, he di&s;cover the <HI>braying of an a&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>From LEOMINSTER we went to that pretty, clean-looking town, LUD|LOW&mdash;who&s;e appearance, from the di&s;tance of two miles&mdash;with the church in the center towering above the hou&s;es&mdash;forms as picture&s;que a <HI>coup d'oeul,</HI> as imagination can conceive.</P>
<P>At LUDLOW I would not perform, becau&s;e the players were there. I &s;hall not &s;o far lift Mr. MILLAR, their manager, into con&s;equence, as to make him a party in this TOUR; nor &s;hall I pay the reader &s;o ill a compliment as to relate the particulars of a low, contemptible plot, which&mdash;as every thing founded
<PB N="106" REF="113">
in fal&s;ity ought&mdash;recoiled, and &s;everely wounded the above pretty gentleman its contriver. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A lion preys not upon carca&s;es"</Q>&mdash;out of pity&mdash;for I found by &s;ome conver&s;ation with one of the magi&s;trates, that the &s;tory had made him as contemptible at LUDLOW as at WORCESTER. We dined, and went on to BRIDGENORTH, which place, and COALBROOK DALE, we had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee. As nothing but plea&s;ure engro&s;&s;ed us for &s;ome time, I &s;hall go on with my account of places, roads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From MONMOUTH&mdash;which commands a beautiful view of both the Wye and the Munow&mdash;we pa&s;&s;ed to HEREFORD; the whole time beguiled by exten|&s;ive, rich, and variegated pro&s;pects. Brown CERES every where had &s;pread her golden &s;tore, and plump POMONA half &s;unk under the weight of her abundant horn. My friend, who&mdash;till he took this journey with me&mdash;had never been forty miles out of LONDON, felt as if he had been tran&s;ported to Ely&s;ium; and as our journey from MONMOUTH was on a Sunday, we took occa&s;ion to remark on the decent cleanline&s;s of the villagers, and the &s;ober, thankful appearance which nature that morning wore. We did not go to church, but I think we had as much the glow of religion in our hearts as tho&s;e who did. You know, among my amu&s;ements, I practi&s;e painting; and I declare mo&s;t &s;acredly, that in delineating the form of a tree&mdash;&s;weeping with my pencil over hills and vallies&mdash;reflecting the various tints of fleecy clouds on the &s;mooth bo&s;om of an exten&s;ive river;&mdash;but more than all this&mdash;rolling in the aetherial expan&s;e, and commanding the winds to &s;hape a collected vapour into a graceful form&mdash;HERVEY never had more delicious contemplations in his flower-garden, than I in tho&s;e moments. An adoration of the author of nature thrills through my &s;pontaneous fancy, and the expan&s;ion of my mind lifts me above the dazzling &s;plendour of emperors. All this I felt on our journey&mdash;and for four hours could talk of nothing el&s;e. I lamented the evils that per&s;ecutions, dogmas, and &s;chi&s;ms have introduced into the world; and how often the milde&s;t and mo&s;t charitable name that ever dignified human nature has been wickedly u&s;ed&mdash;by abominable prie&s;ts&mdash;to enforce &s;laughter,
<PB N="107" REF="114">
exaggerated by cruelty! How much more con&s;onant to the <HI>e&s;&s;ence,</HI> would be the <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of a SUPREME BEING, if&mdash;without a &s;ingle reflection on what others do&mdash;it were comprized in an obedient thankfulness of heart, and a &s;in|cere and grateful acknowledgment of the imminent favours and di&s;tinctions we &s;o bountifully receive from his gracious hand!</P>
<P>HEREFORD &s;eems to be as in&s;en&s;ible of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings as a gorged alder|man of true flavour. The views continued with very little variation, in point of beauty, through our whole route, till we got to WOLVERHAMPTON; when the country became <HI>flat,</HI> and the &s;oil <HI>&s;andy.</HI> About five miles before you reach LEOMINSTER&mdash;which circum&s;tance I mention as a remarkable in|&s;tance of erudition in the commi&s;&s;ioners of the highway in that part of the world, of which body I hope 'Squire KIRKMAN is not a member&mdash;there is a board placed up with the following words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever drives of this road &s;hall be informed upon."</Q> For my part, I would not make any impertinent remarks on any thing I meet, but perhaps they hold &s;ome charter in this part of the world, by u&s;ing this &s;ort of orthography. It is full as &s;en&s;ible&mdash;and much more innocent&mdash;than baiting the bull, at STAMFORD; as however&mdash;though it was incomprehen&s;ible&mdash;it mu&s;t imply &s;ome caution, my friend made a very admi&s;&s;ible alteration, and it read thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever drives <HI>on</HI> this road &s;hall be <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> upon."</Q> Which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, after the four hor&s;es from CHEPSTOW, and an extravagant bill at the <HI>Beaufort Arms,</HI> at MON|MOUTH, we con&s;idered as no unwhole&s;ome hint; and it was pretty well con|firmed when we &s;et out from LUDLOW: going from which place to BRIDGE|NORTH&mdash;if the traveller do not take great care&mdash;he will be &s;ent twenty-five miles, in&s;tead of eighteen. You are a&s;ked if you chu&s;e to make it one &s;tage or two, and told that the road is very hilly. It is more likely therefore you will prefer&mdash;as we did&mdash;the two &s;tages, that the hor&s;es may be fre&s;h and draw you with more &s;pirit, eighteen miles being really a long &s;tage in that country. Thus, without &s;aying a word more, they take you to CLEBURY&mdash;for in the direct road over THE MOOR, and through ASTON and DOWN, there is no
<PB N="108" REF="115">
place to <HI>change hor&s;es.</HI> CLEBURY is <HI>twelve</HI> miles from LUDLOW, and BRIDGENORTH <HI>thirteen</HI> more from CLEBURY. Thus, according to my friend, it is plain, tho&s;e who drive on that road&mdash;if they are not wary&mdash;will be <HI>im|po&s;ed</HI> upon.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over the clay hills in Shrop&s;hire, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t &s;tu|pendous and wonderful in&s;tances of extent and fertility that nature has in all her domain. The objects are &s;o innumerable&mdash;their forms &s;o varied&mdash;and their colours &s;o beautiful, that the eye is&mdash;if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;agonized with enjoyment. Every hundred yards pre&s;ents a new &s;cene, and every &s;cene more charming than that which went before it, till the rapt fancy ri&s;es to &s;ublimity, and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure is lo&s;t in mute wonder! Nor are the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions too &s;trong for the &s;ubject. The hills were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cloud capt,"</Q> and no air balloon could be better &s;ituated for a good pro&s;pect than was our chai&s;e.</P>
<P>In the whole of this journey, I was lo&s;t in plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment; and could not help exclaiming in the text of this letter&mdash;which you may call a &s;ermon, if you plea&s;e, for even in this age I am not a&s;hamed of moralizing&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I con&s;ider the heavens and the work of thy fingers!"</Q></P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING wound&mdash;like the worm of a cork-&s;crew&mdash;round that natural fortification that renders BRIDGENORTH a little GIBRAL|TER&mdash;we arrived there, and &s;upped on the wonders we had &s;een&mdash;for as to the mu&s;ty chickens and high-flavoured ham, there was no eating them. The next morning we explored all the beauties of that uncommonly picture&s;que country; and after dinner, while curio&s;ity was on tiptoe, went on to COAL|BROOK DALE, where we intended to &s;tay the night, and &s;ee every thing wor|thy of ob&s;ervation. This however was not in our power&mdash;for the &s;tench of the &s;ulphur was &s;o potent that we were taken ill; and I prote&s;t&mdash;though I have as few &s;queami&s;h &s;en&s;ations as mo&s;t people&mdash;I never felt my&s;elf &s;o over|come in my life. Indeed, the day was in&s;ufferably hot; which, added to the mon&s;trous piles of coal burning to coke&mdash;the furnaces&mdash;forges&mdash;and other tremendous objects of fire and &s;moke, which &s;pread round us to an immen&s;e di&s;tance&mdash;might probably cau&s;e that &s;uffocating &s;en&s;ation, of which I can give no adequate de&s;cription, but by &s;aying that&mdash;as far as conception can picture&mdash;it mu&s;t have a faint re&s;emblance of being placed in an air pump.&mdash;And yet, though we laboured under this difficulty of re&s;piration, the inhabi|tants
<PB N="110" REF="117">
&mdash;and the workmen e&s;pecially&mdash;feel no inconvenience; but, on the con|trary, as we were told, are remarkably healthy, and live to a great age.</P>
<P>Some particulars relative to the place we were determined, however, to a&s;certain. The tar-&s;pring, for example, was too curious an object to be pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed. We went into the mouth of a bricked arch-way, which reaches three hundred yards; and when we had got about thirty yards, we began to &s;ee the tar ooze from between the crannies in the rock. It mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that from the top of the rock, a pit had been &s;unk, which went to &s;uch an immen&s;e depth, that it would have been very expen&s;ive, and in|deed almo&s;t impracticable, to work it. But, finding the coals of an admira|ble quality, it was thought worth while to form the arch-way, above de|&s;cribed, at the foot of the mountain, and very near the Severn, that the coal might be drawn out in carriages; which mode of getting at them&mdash;in&s;tead of the u&s;ual way&mdash;it was thought would be &s;o much more expeditious and con|venient, as to make a &s;aving&mdash;in a &s;hort time&mdash;equal to the expence of hav|ing formed the arch-way. In the pro&s;ecution of this &s;cheme, the tar made its appearance&mdash;at fir&s;t oozing as we had &s;een it, and afterwards pouring like an inundation, fairly flowing into the Severn. The di&s;covery was made known, and the cour&s;e of the tar diverted by means of iron pipes, which, I a&s;&s;ure the reader, are nearly as large as tho&s;e which convey the water from the new river in LONDON. Large pits were immediately dug, and caldrons of a prodigious magnitude &s;unk; and, by boiling in tho&s;e, it hardened into pitch. There are three &s;prings; one of which emits an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity. The fir&s;t, when we were there, was nearly dried up; which induces the work|men to believe that, in time, the whole will cea&s;e. But who can &s;ay in <HI>what</HI> time. The &s;ame rock may be traced &s;even miles&mdash;and every body knows at that di&s;tance they are now extracting tar from coal, which very probably is a dro&s;&s;y part, of the very tar, that&mdash;about half a mile from the iron bridge&mdash;runs thicker than treacle, but as pellucid as Burgundy.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">I have &s;ince conver&s;ed with a chymical gentleman, who has bought a great deal of it, and he a&s;&s;ures me it has the &s;tronge&s;t &s;imilitude of any thing he ever &s;aw or read of to the famous black pitch u&s;ed by the Egyptians for embalming. This tar is remarkably free from impurity, is as bituminous as a&s;phaltum, and has an agreeable odour, not unlike benjamin.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not leave COALBROOK DALE without &s;aying &s;omething of the famous iron bridge. That &s;tupendous <HI>pattern card</HI>&mdash;for it may well be called &s;o&mdash;is in every re&s;pect one of the mo&s;t <HI>artful</HI> and ingenious contrivances that ever was conceived or executed by man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It con&s;i&s;ts of one arch&mdash;and the river is, in that place, an hundred yards over.</NOTE>&mdash;for at the &s;ame time that it proves the du&s;ky inhabitants of that gloomy region are equal to any thing in the way of iron work&mdash;though ever &s;o ponderous and immen&s;e&mdash;it is a &s;ource of continual profit&mdash;a con&s;tant toll being kept up; which cannot be for the repair of the bridge:&mdash;for, though it looks like net-work wrought in wire, it will apparently la&s;t uninjured for ages.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I offered Mr. HARRIS&mdash;as will hereafter be &s;een&mdash;a number of ideas, wrought into complete &s;cenes, which might in future, &s;upply matter for different Pantomimes.

<P>This place wants nothing but CERBERUS to give you an idea of the hea|then HELL. The Severn may pa&s;s for the Styx&mdash;with this difference&mdash;that old CHARON, become a turnpike-man, u&s;hers you over the iron bridge in|&s;tead of rowing you in his crazy bark. The men and women might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for devils and furies&mdash;and the entrance of any one of tho&s;e blazing caverns for the approach of TARTARUS. Je&s;ting apart. If an athei&s;t, who

never heard of COALBROOK DALE, could be tran&s;ported there in a dream, and left to wake at the mouth of one of tho&s;e furnaces, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with &s;uch numbers of infernal objects&mdash;though he had been all his life the mo&s;t profligate unbeliever that ever added bla&s;phemy to incredulity&mdash;he would in|fallibly tremble at the ju&s;t puni&s;hment he was, in imagination, going to receive.</P>
<P>My friend's fir&s;t remark when he &s;aw the&s;e dingy gentlemen was&mdash;that he &s;hould be &s;orry to meet any of them in a bye lane. Having made the very &s;ame ob&s;ervation to my friend BOYTON upon the colliers at KINGSWOOD&mdash;and being by him &s;atisfied as to the fallacy of it&mdash;I was able to refute his appre|hen&s;ions, by &s;aying that I made no doubt but &s;ome reformer had done the &s;tate &s;o much &s;ervice as to have reconciled the&s;e people to their &s;ituation&mdash;by an a&s;&s;urance that, if they would be hone&s;t, they &s;hould only have a hell in <HI>this world.</HI> This turned out to be the ca&s;e.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING wa&s;hed the &s;ulphur out of out throats by a di&s;h of tea, we &s;et out for SHEFFNAL, and afterwards for WOLVER|HAMPTON, where it was &s;aid we &s;hould find the be&s;t inn in the kingdom&mdash;namely, the <HI>George.</HI> Arriving there, however, at eleven o'clock, and find|ing every body in bed, did not give us an idea of the mo&s;t watchful inn in the kingdom&mdash;and getting no &s;upper till one o'clock, and then a very bad one, did not prove it was the be&s;t provided larder in the kingdom.</P>
<P>The next day we moved to the <HI>Red Lion,</HI> where we were really well treated&mdash;and, the a&s;&s;embly room being in the hou&s;e, I adverti&s;ed my enter|tainment for one night, which was a very indifferent one indeed; as however it was an unfavourable time, and the notice was &s;hort, I &s;incerely believe I &s;hould have mended my &s;ucce&s;s if I had &s;tayed longer. I have in the little time which I was there, to thank Mr. LANE, a merchant, and Mr. SMART, the book&s;eller, for &s;everal civilities&mdash;and I believe this is all I have to &s;ay of WOLVERHAMPTON, except that we &s;aw the proce&s;s of working up that very iron, which at COALBROOK DALE was in &s;o crude a &s;tate, into every po&s;&s;i|ble kind of form&mdash;with the addition of all that belongs to the art of japanning.
<PB N="114" REF="121">
I mu&s;t not forget to remark, that the wonderful di&s;covery of the tar &s;pring was at WOLVERHAMPTON&mdash;though at &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance&mdash;con&s;idered as a mere fable.</P>
<P>Leaving WOLVERHAMPTON we went to BIRMINGHAM, and from thence to LICHFIELD. Here I re&s;olved to give my entertainment, and procured for that purpo&s;e the vicar's hall, which requiring the con&s;ent of a certain number of gentlemen, it came out, among my enquiries, that Mr. PETER GARRICK was living, and in good health. As the new&s;papers long ago&mdash;indeed ju&s;t after the death of his two brothers&mdash;had been inhuman enough to kill him, I never was more &s;urprized at any thing in my life; for, never having &s;een the account of his death contradicted, I own I firmly believed him at re&s;t with his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The moment I found where Mr. GARRICK lived, I ha&s;tened to pay him my re&s;pects. He was very glad to &s;ee me, and we chatted together I believe an hour. The old times of the <HI>Jubilee</HI> and the levees of HAMPTON made great part of our conver&s;ation, and we felt mutual plea&s;ure and pain at the recollection. There were &s;o many points of &s;uperior abilities about GARRICK, that though hi&s;torical ju&s;tice, obliging one to be <HI>faithful,</HI> impels a retro&s;pect of <HI>little</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the mo&s;t &s;triking of the&s;e is, I believe, the following. GARRICK, one day&mdash;ju&s;t before the <HI>Chri&s;tmas Tale</HI> made its appearance&mdash;went into the painting room, and &s;eeing, as he imagined, a prodigious quantity of gold &s;trewed about the floor, began to abu&s;e fir&s;t the man who was grinding the colours, and afterwards to bawl out lu&s;tily for FRENCH, the painter. FRENCH made his appearance, and was thus acco&s;ted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Wha&mdash;why&mdash;hey&mdash;damme&mdash;why you Mr. FRENCH&mdash;is not it&mdash;ey&mdash;the cur&s;ede&s;t thing&mdash;that you will in this harum &s;karum manner&mdash;he&mdash;a&mdash;damme&mdash;ruin me!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God ble&s;s my &s;oul,"</Q> cried FRENCH, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what is the matter Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The matter Sir&mdash;why where are you&mdash;with your damned lack-lu&s;tre eyes&mdash;don't you &s;ee the ground all &s;trewed with gold.

<PB N="115" REF="122">
of a <HI>recorder,</HI> we can mingle a little the ta&s;k of a <HI>panegyri&s;t.</HI> I certainly had many differences with GARRICK, and they aro&s;e from nothing but this&mdash;I would never flatter him. Indeed, had I been capable of that creeping adula|tion, without which no man can arrive to a re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituation in the the|atrical cabinet, or at lea&s;t keep it&mdash;unle&s;s perhaps he be independant&mdash;I might certainly now have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a decent appointment&mdash;roundly a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the bye&mdash;together with the &s;uperlative happine&s;s of being puffed in all the new&s;papers.</P>
<P>GARRICK, notwith&s;tanding, I &s;incerely believe had as good an opinion of me as of any man he ever was connected with; and, on my part, I de|clare that nothing ever gave me more plea&s;ure than my reconciliation with him before he died; which happened&mdash;and it is a remarkable circum&s;tance&mdash;at the la&s;t rehear&s;al of my pantomime of <HI>The Touch&s;tone,</HI> on the night before he went to LORD SPENCER's, from whence all the world knows he returned to the ALDELPHI to breathe his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. PETER GARRICK attended my performance&mdash;and, for one, te&s;tified much &s;atisfaction. The company however, in general, were extremely grave, which I could not po&s;&s;ibly account for, e&s;pecially as Mr. SAVILLE&mdash;who made me many profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s and &s;ervice&mdash;took minutes of the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;erious &s;ongs, with a view of &s;inging them him&s;elf. The truth, however, at la&s;t came out. It &s;eems Mi&s;s SEWARD was there&mdash;without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion nobody at LICHFIELD dares to judge of any thing literary. My entertainment, therefore, coming in &s;ome degree under this de&s;cription, and that lady&mdash;angry I &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould burle&s;que the <HI>Siege of Troy,</HI> or con|jure up the &s;pirit of an <HI>old maid,</HI> or for &s;ome other notable rea&s;on no doubt&mdash;did not chu&s;e to wear a &s;mile the whole evening. What was the i&s;&s;ue?
<PB N="116" REF="123">
The DEAN looked grave&mdash;Mr. SAVILLE looked grave&mdash;every body but Mr. PETER GARRICK looked grave. I announced the &s;econd evening&mdash;every body looked grave. I attended the &s;econd evening&mdash;NOBODY CAME.</P>
<P>It has been confidently &s;aid to me, that a mu&s;ical man at LICHFIELD was very indu&s;trious fir&s;t to prevent, and afterwards&mdash;finding that impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;to decry my entertainment. If this be not a fact, the man I allude to&mdash;un|con&s;cious of ill&mdash;will &s;uffer nothing. If it be, let him reflect&mdash;for I will not give my&s;elf the pain of &s;aying more&mdash;that illiberality was never yet the com|panion of real genius.</P>
<P>Before I quit LICHFIELD I mu&s;t not forget to mention Mr. GREEN's mu&s;eum&mdash;which certainly, for its &s;ize, is one of the complete&s;t in the king|dom. The ores, of various &s;orts, are remarkably curious. The coins, me|dals, and impre&s;&s;ions, large&mdash;in point of number&mdash;and valuable&mdash;in point of neatne&s;s, correctne&s;s, and pre&s;ervation. The di&s;play of the force of magne|ti&s;m is &s;ingularly worth attention; but, indeed, to enumerate every particular of this cabinet of curio&s;ities&mdash;which is wonderfully well filled&mdash;would go far beyond my limits, and yet fall infinitely &s;hort of what the &s;ubject de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Adieu LICHFIELD&mdash;and adieu Mr. GARRICK&mdash;may he long enjoy that &s;olicitous attention he &s;o amply receives from his friends; nor may the dart of death or any other human ill, for years, have more power to hurt him than the ineffectual calumny of a <HI>new&s;paper.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE came to DERBY a day after the races, which might be &s;aid to be&mdash;for me&mdash;a day after the fair:&mdash;for though during two nights that I performed there I was not &s;o thinly attended as at WOLVER|HAMPTON, yet it turned out nothing of con&s;equence. Here we &s;aw that wonderful effect of human ingenuity, the <HI>&s;ilk mill.</HI> We purcha&s;ed &s;ome of the productions of the <HI>Peak,</HI> and we were witne&s;s to the whole proce&s;s of forming, drying, painting, and burning porcelain.</P>
<P>It has happened, among the uncommon circum&s;tances which have at|tended this TOUR, that&mdash;like Sir ROGER DE COVERLY with his watermen and hackney-coach men&mdash;I have employed, by way of bill-carriers, &s;carcely one who has not had &s;ome natural infirmity. At OXFORD, I had two men who had not an arm and a half between them; at another place, I had a &s;ailor with a wooden leg. I have had men with one eye out of number; but here, at DERBY, my <HI>factotum</HI> had been twice &s;crewed up in his coffin. He gave the account of it him&s;elf&mdash;and de&s;cribed, that having lain &s;o long in the cold, had given him ever &s;ince &s;uch a pain in his bones, that&mdash;as HAMLET &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"mine ached to think on't."</Q> He had had from his cradle a lethargic
<PB N="118" REF="125">
habit, and the fir&s;t time he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, he laid in a profound &s;leep for &s;everal days; the &s;econd time longer; but&mdash;being aware of the pro|bable con&s;equence of nailing him up too &s;oon&mdash;they kept him till they were convinced he was actually dead, and having &s;crewed him up&mdash;being nearly &s;uffocated&mdash;he knocked as before, and was let out. His &s;en&s;es were con&s;ider|ably impaired after this&mdash;yet, as far as they went, they were &s;o acute and collected that he never made a &s;ingle blunder in all the me&s;&s;ages I gave him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though human calamities are the la&s;t &s;ubject on which I &s;hould chu&s;e to be facetious, yet I cannot here refrain from recording an anecdote&mdash;but little known&mdash;of THE. CIBBER. This &s;trange, eccentric wag, in company with three other <HI>Bon Vivants,</HI> made an excur&s;ion to FRANCE. THE. had a fal&s;e &s;et of teeth&mdash;a &s;econd a <HI>gla&s;s-eye</HI>&mdash;a third a <HI>cork leg</HI>&mdash;but the fourth had nothing particular except a remarkable way of &s;haking his head. They travelled in a po&s;t coach&mdash;and while they were going the fir&s;t &s;tage&mdash;after each had made merry with his neighbour's infirmity&mdash;they agreed that at every baiting place they would all affect the &s;ame &s;ingularity. When they came to breakfa&s;t they were all to &s;quint&mdash;and, as the countrymen &s;tood gaping round, when they fir&s;t alighted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'od rot it'</Q> cried one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'how that man &s;quints!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why dom thee,'</Q> &s;ays a &s;econd, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here be another &s;quinting fellow!'</Q> The third was thought to be a better &s;quinter than the other two, and the fourth better than all the re&s;t. In &s;hort, language cannot expre&s;s how admirably they &s;quinted&mdash;for they went one degree be|yond the &s;uperlative. At dinner, they all appeared to have cork legs, and their &s;tumping about made more diver&s;ion than they had done at breakfa&s;t. At tea, they were all deaf; but at &s;upper&mdash;which was at the Ship at DOVER&mdash;each man rea&s;&s;umed his character, the better to play his part in a farce they had concerted among them. When they were ready to go to bed, CIBBER called out to the waiter&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Here you fellow!&mdash;take out my teeth.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Teeth Sir!"</Q> &s;aid the man. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, teeth Sir. Un&s;crew that wire, and you will find they'll all come out together,'</Q> After &s;ome he&s;itation, the man did as he was ordered. This was no &s;ooner performed, than a &s;econd called out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here you&mdash;take out my eye.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the waiter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your eye!"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, my eye. Come here you &s;tupid dog&mdash;pull up that eye-lid, and it will come out as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible.'</Q> This done, a third cried out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here you ra&s;cal&mdash;take off my leg.'</Q> This he did with le&s;s reluctance, being before apprized that it was cork, and al&s;o conceived that it would be his la&s;t job. He was however mi&s;taken. The fourth watched his opportunity, and while the poor frightened waiter was &s;urveying, with a rueful counte|tenance, the <HI>eye, teeth,</HI> and <HI>leg,</HI> laying upon the table&mdash;cryed out, in a frightful hollow voice, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'come here Sir&mdash;take off my head.'</Q> Turning round, and &s;eeing the man's head &s;haking like that of a mandarine upon a chimney piece, he darted out of the room&mdash;and, after tumbling headlong down &s;tairs, he ran about the hou&s;e, &s;wearing that the <HI>gentlemen</HI> up &s;tairs were certainly all <HI>devils.</HI></P><P>This is a proper place to notice that at WORCESTER a <HI>madman</HI> took a great liking to me. He is perfectly harmle&s;s, and &s;uffered to go to all their public entertainments. He promi&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe five thou&s;and pounds towards building me a room, and &s;aid Mr. PITT would repay him out of the overplus after &s;aving the million a year. I &s;hould not have mentioned this man but for one circum&s;tance. He calls him&s;elf Sir EDWARD MASON, Knight of the poker&mdash;carrying a large one con&s;tantly in his button hole&mdash;and has badges of di&s;tinction &s;ewed all over his clothes. A&s;king him how he came by a fine &s;tar upon his &s;leeve&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Sir,'</Q> &s;aid he, the KING OF PRUSSIA&mdash;the KING OF PRUSSIA&mdash;la&s;t battle&mdash;mark of <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'honour&mdash;he and I&mdash;fought the whole army&mdash;killed, conquered, and plundered&mdash;tied the commander to a tree&mdash;robbed him of <HI>forty thou&s;and pounds</HI>&mdash;and his WATCH.'</Q> Thus, how naturally he con&s;oli|dated the characters of <HI>warrior</HI> and <HI>thief.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Having been on a flat &s;andy &s;oil ever &s;ince we left Shrop&s;hire, we be|gan to look about us in our way to NOTTINGHAM&mdash;where there are cer|tainly many picture&s;que views&mdash;and, for people not ju&s;t come&mdash;as we were&mdash;from the borders of WALES&mdash;for I affronted a Welch waiter in Monmouth|&s;hire, by a&s;king him if we might not call our&s;elves in WALES&mdash;to which he
<PB N="119" REF="126">
an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Cot ple&s;s hur and luff hur, to be &s;ure it is <HI>Waales,</HI> but it is not <HI>Welch Waales</HI> look you.'</Q> NOTTINGHAM ca&s;tle is a very hand&s;ome object, and the uniformity of the piazza in the market-place, gave me an idea of its being a very likely town for my purpo&s;e&mdash;but I was born to bear and laugh at di&s;appointments&mdash;as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>We are told that NOTTINGHAM was, by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> called SNOTTING|HAM; upon which word one might &s;o pun as to make it truly de&s;cribe the inhabitants; for they are a kind of <HI>mucus,</HI> which, though u&s;eful in the ge|neral work of commercial circulation, cannot avoid being in it&s;elf <HI>na&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>After having con&s;ulted with Ma&s;ter BURBAGE, the printer, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee Mr. MAYOR, who pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;hop door as we were talking, and, at BURBAGE's de&s;ire, walked in. I do not recollect the gentle|man's name&mdash;but, having told him my bu&s;ine&s;s, he exclaimed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"niow, you actor man, what would you <HI>hay?</HI> I hope you don't coom with ony

Mr. DIBDIN with drums and trumpets! Good God, Mr. MAYOR! Sir!&mdash;why Sir!&mdash;drums and trumpets!&mdash;do you know the price is half-a-crown?&mdash;you don't know Mr. DIBDIN&mdash;how could you&mdash;Lord have mercy! Mr. MAYOR&mdash;drums and trumpets!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, well, well, well"</Q>&mdash;cried the MAYOR <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not know about the&s;e things, but I don't want a hooboob in the tiown. Will you on&s;wer that it wawnt corrupt the morals of the prentices and the work folk?"</Q> BURBAGE undertook for me&mdash;but not till he had completely gone over the bu&s;ine&s;s of the drums and trumpets once more.</P>
<P>After Mr. MAYOR had retired&mdash;quite &s;atisfied no doubt with having &s;hewn his con&s;equence, and great regard to the morals of the SNOTTING|HAMITES&mdash;I enquired of my friend, little BURBAGE, how the ta&s;te of the town &s;tood in relation to entertainments, and he very hone&s;tly told me that if I would adverti&s;e to &s;wallow pins or eat burning tow, I &s;hould &s;tand a better chance than by furni&s;hing any thing that appealed to the under&s;tandings and liberal feelings of mankind. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Or &s;uppo&s;e'</Q>&mdash;&s;aid he&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you was to let them come in gratis at a &s;hilling a-piece.'</Q> I could not po&s;&s;ibly conceive what he would be at. Upon a&s;king him to explain&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Oh,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the CHEVALIER TAYLOR practi&s;ed &s;uch a <HI>manoeuvre</HI> with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;He wrote a letter indi&s;criminately to every inhabitant of NOTTINGHAM&mdash;&s;aying&mdash;that he would give a lecture on the eye <HI>gratis.</HI> His room was not only thronged, but every lady made a point of dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in her be&s;t, in return to the CHEVALIER's politene&s;s. They were fir&s;t admitted into an outer room, and attended by a kind of ma&s;ter of ceremonies, who in|formed them, with great good breeding and deference, that as the lecture the CHEVALIER meant to give was very ab&s;tru&s;e, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be rendered familiar to the comprehen&s;ion of &s;uch as did not anatomically under&s;tand optics&mdash;his employer, the CHEVALIER, had with great conde|&s;cen&s;ion and good nature cau&s;ed a book to be printed which would clearly
<PB N="121" REF="128">
explain the mo&s;t difficult pa&s;&s;ages of the lecture, even to the meane&s;t under|&s;tanding; that, indeed, this book was worth <HI>half a crown</HI>&mdash;but the CHEVA|LIER, determined in all things to &s;hew his candour and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s&mdash;would have the very great kindne&s;s to &s;ell it at no more than <HI>one &s;hilling.</HI> Some few murmured, but the major part bought the book; and thus the crafty CHEVALIER put in his pocket about five hundred &s;hillings, through an impudent &s;tratagem, when, by the common mode of adverti&s;ing two &s;hillings admittance, he would have been a fortnight receiving five pounds. God,'</Q> &s;aid little BURBAGE&mdash;for he is a talkative, goodnatured fellow&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I'll tell you another &s;tory of the CHEVALIER. He be&s;poke a wig, Sir&mdash;a tie wig&mdash;of a poor, harmle&s;s fellow&mdash;a barber here in our good town of NOTTINGHAM&mdash;and went away to LOUGHBOROUGH without it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE old contemptible bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uppo&s;ing me an impo&s;tor was brought up at NOTTINGHAM. The report had gone out, and one WISE gentleman a&s;&s;ured me that he had &s;een Mr. DIBDIN, in <HI>a black wig,</HI> three years before, at the <HI>Circus.</HI> Finding matters were taking an un|plea&s;ant turn, I adverti&s;ed that&mdash;as I under&s;tood &s;uch a rumour had prevailed, and as it was a very &s;erious thing for me that it &s;hould be cleared up&mdash;if any at the end of the entertainment &s;hould feel the &s;malle&s;t difficulty to believe that I was in no re&s;pect an impo&s;tor, their money &s;hould be returned. This brought me a good room, and ten minutes had not pa&s;&s;ed before I plainly &s;aw all their doubts were vani&s;hed. At the place I generally pau&s;e, many apologies were made me; to which &s;ome &s;pirited officers pre&s;ent an&s;wered, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the be&s;t thing they could po&s;&s;ibly do was to be totally &s;ilent, for the utmo&s;t in their power to &s;ay would rather aggravate than le&s;&s;en the ab&s;ur|dity of their conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I introduced, upon this occa&s;ion, in the <HI>Readings,</HI> what follows. The poet related a whim&s;ical di&s;tre&s;s he had once laboured under. Said he <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I once took it in my head to deliver a little entertain|ment, at different places, which I called <HI>Readings</HI>&mdash;and, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good profe&s;&s;ional reputa|tion, it was &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected that a man of my &s;tanding would not think &s;uch an experiment worth his while&mdash;and, in con&s;equence, I was now and then treated as an impo&s;tor, for&mdash;as one may &s;ay&mdash;per&s;onating my&s;elf. This induced me to relate, to my next audience, the following poetic tale.'<Q><LG>
<L>IN ROME, where arts &s;pring up, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
<L>As &s;pawn &s;hoots in a mu&s;hroom bed&mdash;</L>
<L>Two theatres of &s;ome renown</L>
<L>A&s;pir'd alike to plea&s;e the town,</L>
<L>Both&mdash;on the plan of ours in LONDON&mdash;</L>
<L>Were &s;ometimes rich, and &s;ometimes undone;</L>
<L>Were &s;ometimes empty&mdash;&s;ometimes cramm'd&mdash;</L>
<L>And prais'd and cen&s;ur'd&mdash;puff'd and damn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alike their fortune and their fame</L>
<L>Till, as we hear, one ROSCIUS came,</L>
<L>At a high &s;alary engag'd,</L>
<L>The wond'ring town to &s;ee him rag'd;</L>
<L>Actor did ne'er &s;uch numbers draw&mdash;</L>
<L>For, was his part to kick a &s;traw,</L>
<L>Or frown his fearful monarchs dead,</L>
<L>Or dance&mdash;or &s;tand upon his head&mdash;</L>
<L>Fame &s;poke him the theatric king,</L>
<L>And all the world came in a &s;tring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'What can be done'&mdash;&s;aid th' other hou&s;e,</L>
<L>'We play&mdash;but don't receive a &s;ou&s;e;</L>
<L>'Our la&s;t new thing no &s;oul would &s;it it!'</L>

<L>"Let us &s;tick up in large black letter,</L>
<L>"That we can <HI>do the pig</HI>&mdash;MUCH BETTER.</L>

<L>So &s;aid, &s;o done&mdash;the bills are &s;tuck,</L>
<L>The town with con&s;ternation &s;truck,</L>
<L>Better than ROSCIUS! In&s;olent!</L>
<L>But 'tis a &s;tep they may repent!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The night arriv'd&mdash;and in a &s;warm,</L>
<L>The audience throng'd&mdash;a boding &s;torm</L>
<L>Hung hov'ring on each &s;ullen brow&mdash;</L>
<L>The hou&s;e is &s;till as death&mdash;and now,</L>
<L>While fearful preparation's making,</L>
<L>The humble actor comes on quaking&mdash;</L>
<L>Thrice low he bows&mdash;then &s;ilence breaking,</L>
<L>In&s;tant the audience hear a &s;queaking.</L>
<L>But what's heard next!&mdash;groan, hi&s;s, and &s;coff,</L>
<L>The &s;tunning catcal&mdash;off&mdash;off&mdash;off.</L>
<L>Noi&s;e follows noi&s;e&mdash;&s;hout echos &s;hout,</L>
<L>And all the ladies are turn'd out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, by dint of right ability,</L>
<L>Patience&mdash;mild ge&s;ture&mdash;and humility,</L>
<L>After an hour's &s;tout per&s;evering,</L>
<L>Th' intrepid actor gain'd a hearing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His words were; "Gentlemen, don't grudge,</L>
<L>"In this ca&s;e, for your&s;elves to judge.</L>
<L>"If he in whom you &s;o delight</L>

<L>This &s;aid&mdash;he takes, to crown the joke,</L>
<L>A pig from underneath his cloak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he had better &s;av'd the trouble,</L>
<L>The clamour in&s;tantly was double;</L>
<L>Sconces were broke&mdash;benches pull'd down,</L>
<L>And planet-&s;truck, throughout the town,</L>
<L>Wailing, ran routed kings and queens,</L>
<L>While in a bonfire blaz'd the &s;cenes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To men, who will per&s;i&s;t in error,</L>
<L>Say, who &s;hall dare to hold a mirror.</L>
<L>From hone&s;t common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on,</L>
<L>All arguments were out of &s;ea&s;on;</L>
<L>And while the frenzy rages high,</L>
<L>Fair truth it&s;elf &s;hall &s;eem a lie.</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT HULL, my friend left me, with a view&mdash;as his affairs in town pre&s;&s;ed his return&mdash;to pro&s;ecute the remainder of his jour|ney with more expedition than my &s;cheme would permit. From HULL I went to YORK, where I performed, by way of e&s;&s;ay, without mentioning any &s;pecific time. I was tolerably attended, and a gentleman&mdash;in the name of the re&s;t&mdash;advi&s;ed me, as the oratorios at DONCASTER were to be in the following week, not to do any thing more at YORK till they &s;hould be over. I took his advice, and went to MALTON and SCARBOROUGH. At the fir&s;t place, I received many promi&s;es, which, as they were made by the par&s;on and the attorney, it is not wonderful that they came to nothing. At SCARBOROUGH nobody would &s;tir without the DUCHESS OF RUTLAND; and as I had neither time nor intere&s;t to conciliate her patronage, I returned with my jaunt for my pains. At my next e&s;&s;ay at YORK, the company were to be &s;ure returned from DONCASTER&mdash;but they were not recovered from their fatigue. I there|fore&mdash;to give them a little more breathing time&mdash;was coaxed into another ex|cur&s;ion, and promi&s;ed great things on my return.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136">My intention was to have a few nights alternately at LEEDS and WAKE|FIELD. Having however a very thin audience indeed at the fir&s;t place, and being out of temper with YORK, I went, by the advice of a clergyman at WAKEFIELD&mdash;in who&s;e company I had the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome happy hours&mdash;to SHEFFIELD. Having however very little time to &s;pare&mdash;this being the fifteenth of October, and my adverti&s;ements &s;tanding for the eighteenth at YORK, I performed two nights&mdash;one of which was a very decent one&mdash;and received &s;o much private and public civility, that I promi&s;ed, when the players &s;hould be gone&mdash;which was not expected to be till after Chri&s;tmas&mdash;to return. Coming back to WAKEFIELD, I had a third night, which was a very good one. At SHEFFIELD I met with Dr. MILLER of DONCASTER, and Mr. F. SHARP of GRANTHAM, both of whom gave me warm invitations to their re&s;pective towns, which you will find, in the &s;equel, I accepted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;ay a word at pre&s;ent of the&s;e different places&mdash;having to touch at them again&mdash;not even of YORK, to which I returned to wor&s;e purpo&s;e than ever, and left it in di&s;gu&s;t. From thence I went to BEVERLY, to call a council of war with my friend SOUTHERN, to whom I &s;hall introduce the reader. This gentleman has the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of HULL and BEVERLY as a dancing ma&s;ter&mdash;a character not always worthy a con&s;picuous &s;ituation&mdash;but here, and in the in&s;tance of Mr. SOUTHERN's &s;on, at WAKEFIELD&mdash;who I could not place before his father&mdash;remarkably &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. SOUTHERN is no foreign impo&s;tor, of which de&s;cription&mdash;to the di&s;grace of our &s;chools, the injury of the &s;cholars' morals, and too often the de&s;truction of family peace&mdash;this kingdom &s;warms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never feel any thing like &s;atisfaction at the di&s;tre&s;s of others, except when the&s;e frontle&s;s gentlemen meet with men as crafty as them&s;elves. There are in&s;tances, however, when foreigners are as much impo&s;ed on in ENGLAND, as ENGLISHMEN are in FRANCE&mdash;and the following is one of them. FIERVILLE, who, wallowing in Engli&s;h riches, did not&mdash;like his countrymen in ge|neral&mdash;retire and laugh at his patrons; but gave into every extravagant folly he could devi&s;e; had, among the re&s;t, a MENAGERIE, and would give any &s;um for extraordinary objects to fill it. This a certain dealer in wild bea&s;ts and foreign birds&mdash;not far from the top of the <HI>Haymarket</HI>&mdash;hearing, he de|mined to make &s;omething out of FIERVILLE. For this purpo&s;e, he called one day at his country hou&s;e&mdash;accompanied by a man with a large ba&s;ket&mdash;and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. Being &s;hewn in, he ac|co&s;ted FIERVILLE&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Servant Sir, hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curio&s;ities, I have brought you two of the mo&s;t beautifule&s;t birds in the whole world.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am very glad to &s;ee you Sare,"</Q> &s;aid FIERVILLE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vill you plea&s;e to tell me vat it is."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why you mu&s;t know Sir I have had a lord or two after them, and &s;everal fine ladies, and I believe one duche&s;s&mdash;but I loves the foreign gentlemen d'ye &s;ee, by rea&s;on all my goods come from abroad&mdash;and &s;o Sir I had rather you &s;hould have the&s;e PINK GEESE of mine than another.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PIG GEESE!

I mu&s;t have the gee&s;e&mdash;but I got no monies."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">O Lord never mind that! I don't want 'money. There is two &s;ine cows and a calf under the window, I'll take they for the <HI>gee&s;e.</HI>'</Q> FIER|VILLE, who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acqui&s;ition, exclaimed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ple&s;s my &s;oul well tought&mdash;you &s;hall have dem. Here Chon! Go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe."</Q> In &s;hort, the man drove away the cows and the calf, and left the <HI>pink gee&s;e</HI> behind, which were depo|&s;ited in an outhou&s;e till a proper place could be prepared for them. The next morning a friend of FIERVILLE&mdash;a blunt hone&s;t fellow&mdash;came to vi&s;it him, on whom he opened immediately&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah my teer friend, I haf de mo&s;t crate curio&s;ity ever was &s;ee.

Come along vid me."</Q> He then took his friend to the outhou&s;e, which having carele&s;&s;ly been le&s;t open, the gee&s;e had made their e&s;cape. After a clo&s;e &s;earch for &s;ome time, they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock, but it having rained in the night, the <HI>pink gee&s;e</HI> were become as <HI>grey as a badger</HI>&mdash;and nothing could have di&s;covered they were the &s;ame but now and then a little red &s;pot under the wings. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why damme'</Q> cried the friend, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you have been impo&s;ed upon&mdash;the&s;e are nothing but a couple of common grey Lincoln&s;hire fen gee&s;e.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By cot,"</Q> &s;aid FIERVILLE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he vas ferry fine ret indeet la&s;t night.

What did you give pray for this pretty bargain?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Two koes and a kofe."</Q> After reprobating FIERVILLE's credulity in pretty &s;trong terms, his anger all turned on the bird merchant, who he &s;wore &s;hould &s;mart for this impudent fraud. To put his de&s;ign in execution, he went immediately to him, and having threatened to take him before Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT, procured a re&s;titution of fourteen pounds&mdash;the &s;um for which it was pretended the cows and calf were &s;old.</P><P>There is another anecdote of this &s;ame mon&s;ter-monger.&mdash;He &s;old to a lady of di&s;tinction a number of what he called JAVA SPARROWS, which were of cour&s;e no more than common ENGLISH SPARROWS &s;tained a fine blue. At the time of their moulting they became exactly like other SPARROWS, when, being &s;ent for and taxed with the impo&s;ition, he had the addre&s;s to make it believed that it was the climate and the common food of birds in this country that made them degenerate; and, that if they were carried back to JAVA, they would infallibly recover their former beauty.</P></NOTE> He is an hone&s;t, plain,

<P>GO to INDIA&mdash;dig in mines&mdash;tempt any danger&mdash;do any thing to better your fortune&mdash;to place your&s;elf beyond the power of &s;uch humiliation! I declare to heaven I could not <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI> the mortifications that you have <HI>&s;miled</HI> at, let what might be the con&s;ideration. The na&s;ty <HI>Snottinghamites</HI> alone would have &s;ickened me to &s;uch a degree, that when I appeared before them, it would have given me all the qualmi&s;hne&s;s and have produced all the effect of an emetic.

<P>What &s;hall I call you? That you are &s;u&s;ceptible&mdash;quickly, vividly &s;o&mdash;I am convinced; and yet, where &s;en&s;ibility might laudably, hone&s;tly take fire, you exhibit a &s;toici&s;m beyond all example. I cannot comprehend you. I have traced you now, &s;ince you fir&s;t corre&s;ponded with me, nearly fourteen hundred miles. What to do? It is impo&s;&s;ible it can have been worth your while. Can the conver&s;ation and attention of a few individuals of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, approach any thing near to an amends for all the contumely heaped on you by the &s;u&s;picions of a &s;et of people who have placed you in

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t letter is &s;o pointed that I &s;hall &s;top &s;hort my narrative to an&s;wer it, and that the world may be in better po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, I have a printed proof of it before me.</P>
<P>You have taken more pains to abu&s;e me than I have to de&s;erve it, and I could &s;ilence all that warmth and vivacity in which you calumniate me under the title of a &s;u&s;ceptible &s;toic, by &s;ingly a&s;&s;erting that I am a PUBLIC CHA|RACTER. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Good God!'</Q> &s;ay you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>&s;o am I.</HI>'</Q> Have patience. <HI>You</HI> can dictate to your audience; you can win them, by hone&s;t and fair per&s;ua&s;ion, to a di&s;charge of that duly without the exerci&s;e of which they can neither be good men nor valuable citizens. But&mdash;admirable as your doctrines are&mdash;do you think no pulpit oration of yours has been critici&s;ed? Did you never &s;ee a guttling alderman a&s;leep&mdash;while &s;ome fortune hunter was making love to his daughter&mdash;in one of your very be&s;t &s;ermons? When you have &s;trove with benevolent mildne&s;s to inculcate the principles of rea&s;onable religion, and blend public wor&s;hip with private morality, were you, upon your honour, never blamed for tamene&s;s and in&s;ipidity, and cen&s;ured for not frightening your hearers into a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;erable &s;inful condition, by lowering out damnation with uplifted hands?</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="142">A field preacher is not fairly inducted into his calling till he has been forty times &s;tunned with brick bats and blind puppies. But this is nothing to what is every day &s;u&s;tained by men in much more con&s;picuous &s;ituations than you or I. Is Mr. Fox's poi&s;oned bag forgot? the difficulty with which Mr. PITT made his e&s;cape from the grocers' company? or the dingy appear|ance of Lord JOHN CAVENDISH after he had been rolled in the kennel at YORK. Be&s;ide, the&s;e matters fluctuate. What is a mark of di&s;grace at one time, &s;hall, at another, be a badge of honour; and it has been often &s;een that a man who has been pelted with dead cats to-day&mdash;by the hands of the MOB&mdash;has, to-morrow, received a ribbon at the hands of his SOVEREIGN.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French author&mdash;by way of commenting on general manners&mdash;carries &s;everal different charac|ters to a variety of parts; and, among the re&s;t, places them among a horde of &s;avages. Doubtful what may be their reception, they con&s;ult together what to do&mdash;le&s;t, by &s;ome mi&s;take in their mode of addre&s;&s;ing the natives, they my get murdered. At lungth a CARTHUSIAN MONK&mdash;who has ob&s;erved that in their ceremonies they u&s;e among one another are mixed many extravagant actions and ge&s;ticula|tions&mdash;goes up to their chief, and having &s;worn at him in a good round hand, brandi&s;hed a cudgel over his head, kicked him in the guts, and &s;pit in this face, the whole troop pay homage to the &s;trangers, and they are treated with every po&s;&s;ible civility while they remain among them.</NOTE></P>
<P>Shew me the mo&s;t ful&s;ome puff you ever &s;aw to prop a &s;inking play, or recommend a faded actre&s;s, and I will &s;hew you an adverti&s;ement from a par|liamentary candidate to match it. How completely has CHURCHILL written a lampoon on him&s;elf in the <HI>Conference.</HI> I think it is the paragraph which begins with that non&s;en&s;ical di&s;tich

In another place&mdash;and I believe ano|ther poem&mdash;he pants for fame, and fondly fancies that &s;ome one &s;traying in

the church-yard where he lies buried, &s;hall read his works over his grave, by way of <HI>epitaph.</HI> No bad &s;troke of vanity by the bye for the <HI>manly</HI> CHURCHILL. But how would his du&s;t feel if the gentleman by accident &s;hould hit upon&mdash;<HI>the above quotation!</HI></P>
<P>Every man has his motives for his public conduct; mine are&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding the conjectures of a few unbelieving individuals&mdash;neither more nor le&s;s than tho&s;e I announce. I will be free to acknowledge that, in the pro|&s;ecution of my &s;cheme, I have met with &s;ore di&s;appointments: but the&s;e are the very &s;purs, the very incentives to a further pur&s;uit. If I had retired upon meeting a rebuff or two what would have been the conclu&s;ion of my enemies? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This man fondly fancied him&s;elf a favourite of the public, but they have convinced him they do not care three-pence about him.'</Q> Having per&s;i&s;ted, they will &s;ee that it has procured me &s;uch friends as will &s;ilence the tongue of envy, and blunt the poi&s;oned arrows of malignity. If CHURCHILL gloried in his WILKES, what mu&s;t I do when I can name more than twenty who <HI>really po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> tho&s;e valuable mental requi&s;ites which in his favourite he <HI>doatingly fancied.</HI> The firm attachment and per&s;evering kindne&s;s of that gentleman alone who made with me a circuit of more than &s;even hundred miles&mdash;fir&s;t left me at HULL, and afterwards took his final leave at YORK&mdash;is more than enough to compen&s;ate for all the arrogance, ignorance, and empty con&s;e|quence that have di&s;graced tho&s;e who could not di&s;tingui&s;h between a fair and liberal compact with the public, and the dirty impudence of a depredating itinerant. It is true I did not acquire this gentleman's friend&s;hip in con&s;e|quence of my tour; I have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that plea&s;ure for &s;ome years; but it con|firmed and &s;trengthened it. So many mortifications has he been witne&s;s to and &s;o much has he pitied and commended me for a temporary per&s;everance&mdash;as the foundation of ultimate independence&mdash;that I am &s;ure I have &s;ecured his valuable e&s;teem upon &s;o firm and permanent a ba&s;is, that nothing can &s;hake it. Let me here a&s;&s;ure him that the many and hand&s;ome in&s;tances of broad and generous liberality that I have repeatedly received, both at the hands of

his father and him&s;elf, neither time nor di&s;tance &s;hall era&s;e from my memory, and that I never employed any moment to more grateful or plea&s;urable advantage than that when I have endeavoured to promote their intere&s;t; which, after all, is but a mutual obligation between them and the public. Many other very marking traits of friend&s;hip and attention you have already &s;een, and many more are to come; among which I cannot help noticing the kindne&s;s of a &s;mall number in LONDON, where I prote&s;t I began to fear I had &s;carcely a friend. The many &s;truggles I have there made to enfranchi&s;e my&s;elf from the &s;hackles of dependence&mdash;the general, hurtful, falacious opinion, that I have often had fortune in my power, but have wantonly and prodigally &s;purned the courteous benefit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The truth of this will he &s;een by an e&s;timate of my pieces, which having explained to a friend, he a&s;&s;ured me he thought it an information of a mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> nature to the PUBLIC.</NOTE> laid &s;o firm a foundation for the dexterous exertions of &s;lander, that, like the mutilated picture of PRAXITILES, I con|ceived my&s;elf, in LONDON&mdash;where any man's fame can be murdered with impunity&mdash;to have been all <HI>one blot.</HI> Happily however, through the filth and dirtine&s;s of all the malice &s;puttered out by irritated dulne&s;s and bur&s;ting envy, a cho&s;en few have been able to di&s;cern the neglected condition of an inoffen|&s;ive traveller, and&mdash;like the good Samaritan, opened their hearts to a &s;en&s;e of his ill treatment. Not that I mean to paint my ca&s;e as a deplorable one. No, pride and my good &s;pirits forbid it; but there is&mdash;as I have remarked before&mdash;&s;omething for me &s;o winning, &s;o warm, &s;o exhilirating, in &s;pontaneous good|nature, that I receive from it the &s;ame cheering and invigorating ray of genial comfort that a plant imbibes from the cheri&s;hing influence of the &s;un. I &s;hall hereafter particularize &s;ome of the in&s;tances to which I here only allude; and will conclude this letter, while my heart is full of the kindne&s;s of my <HI>friend</HI> and <HI>fellow-traveller</HI> above, with &s;aying, that though I con&s;ider <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fame as an echo,"</Q> and&mdash;as much as SHAKESPEARE&mdash;hold it ridiculous to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;eek the bubble reputation in the cannon's month;"</Q> yet I hope demeaning my&s;elf with proper humility, as a public character, will not render me unfit for the

duties of private friend&s;hip, or induce me to make an ill u&s;e of fortune, &s;hould it ever be in my power. Tho&s;e will be&s;t command who know how to obey, is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim; and I believe the be&s;t command and obedience within the exerci&s;e of the human mind, is a peremptory &s;ubduction of all feelings but tho&s;e which tend to the expan&s;ion of the heart, and promote the wide and be|nevolent circulation of univer&s;al liberality, and an implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all tho&s;e moral duties which &s;often the manners, humanize the &s;oul, and impel us to beneficent acts of general fraternal kindne&s;s that can alone <HI>dignify rea&s;on,</HI> and lift us into MANLY PREEMINENCE.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING pretty well&mdash;I hope&mdash;quieted your &s;cru|ples in my la&s;t letter, I &s;hall now proceed in my narrative, which&mdash;like the man with a black and white coat in the ma&s;querade&mdash;&s;ometimes pre&s;ents you with one colour and &s;ometimes another. You have &s;een the black &s;ide too much, I confe&s;s, but in future the white will be predominant. I have men to introduce you to, who will convince you that hone&s;t-hearted liberality is not extinct;&mdash;but they are &s;tars that can &s;hine without any borrowed lu&s;tre, and therefore let them come in their place.</P>
<P>At BEVERLY I fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued my propo&s;als for printing this work; after which&mdash;taking one night at HULL&mdash;I pa&s;&s;ed on to LINCOLN, where my friend SOUTHERN was told&mdash;on his return from LONDON&mdash;they would be glad to &s;ee me. On the fourth of November&mdash;falling on a Sunday, and be|ing exactly ninety-nine years &s;ince the memorable revolution&mdash;the wind being almo&s;t due &s;outh, very &s;trong and &s;qually, accompanied with a &s;evere and in|ce&s;&s;ant rain. I &s;et &s;ail from HULL to BARTON. Nor is all this preparation unworthy the occa&s;ion. I am &s;ure I &s;hall endure nothing in my voyage to INDIA that will exceed what I then experienced; for if it did, we &s;hould be all pa&s;t endurance. ANSON, it is &s;aid, was in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and was
<PB N="140" REF="147">
heard to exclaim, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he feared, after having been &s;afely round the world, it was his fate to be drowned in a fi&s;h-pond."</Q> But he e&s;caped, and &s;o did I, which I believe is all we can either of us &s;ay. But to proceed.</P>
<P>As we were getting out of the harbour, a man fell overboard from a brig which lay very near us, and di&s;agreeable as the weather was, three or four boats ha&s;tened immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but will it be believed that when they found he was an exci&s;eman, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty they could be prevailed upon to afford him relief. I declare to God I never felt &s;o wretchedly in my life. That private piques between admirals and generals &s;hould re&s;train their public exertions, and &s;o tarni&s;h the glory of nations one does not wonder at: that a judge &s;hould recommend a jury to find a man guilty, rather than break through an e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>etiquette,</HI> or lo&s;e his dinner: that the <HI>ax</HI> &s;hould now and then be poi&s;ed, and the <HI>halter</HI> frequently &s;tretched, and the executioner glory in his dexterity: that a mercile&s;s attorney, for the &s;ake of thirteen and four-pence, &s;hould coolly advi&s;e his client to ruin a whole family: none of the&s;e &s;urpi&s;e one. But that a &s;et of wretches &s;hould mock the agony of an expiring fellow-creature&mdash;merely becau&s;e he was di&s;charging a di&s;agreeable office by the king's authority&mdash;is a wanton cruelty &s;o unnece&s;|&s;ary and &s;o di&s;graceful, that I &s;incerely hope it never was practi&s;ed before, nor will ever again. The poor exci&s;eman, through much earne&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, was lodged &s;afely in one of the boats; and I had the plea&s;ure, before we got out of the harbour, to &s;ee him &s;tanding upright. At fir&s;t, however, he &s;eemed quite gone. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Damme, the exci&s;eman's dead'</Q>&mdash;cried one&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'So much the better'</Q>&mdash;cried another&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he is gone to his father the devil then.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, no'</Q>&mdash;&s;aid another&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he &s;tirs, he is only drunk.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, ay'</Q>&mdash;&s;aid a <HI>genteel man</HI> on board our <HI>&s;loop</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he could not help <HI>ta&s;ting</HI>; he has been gauging you &s;ee the good liquor below.

<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck my attention was a di&s;pute between the &s;ailors, whether they &s;hould take in two or three reefs in the main&s;ail and fore&s;ail, the majority however&mdash;being two to one, for our &s;hip's company con&s;i&s;ted of no more than three&mdash;was in favour of the two reefs, and pre&s;ently we were a mile from land. It now blew and rained very hard, and three &s;ailors, who happened to be pa&s;&s;engers, came down into the cabin. They were a&s;ked by the re&s;t many que&s;tions&mdash;for an univer&s;al terror had began to prevail&mdash;and they all agreed that we carried too much &s;ail, but refu&s;ed to interfere&mdash;for they were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not afraid of weather&mdash;be&s;ide, it was no concern of theirs."</Q> The di&s;&s;entient voice upon deck was continually heard to exclaim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"don't you &s;ee what &s;hort &s;eas &s;he &s;hips.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the coach which carried me from BARTON to LINCOLN were two of tho&s;e &s;ailors who came pa&s;&s;engers, and who had been &s;ent from LONDON to HULL, and now were returning back to LONDON, in &s;earch of a little prize-money, which had been due to them ever &s;ince the la&s;t war. They &s;aid they did not know how &s;uch things came about, but it had always been the way to &s;end poor fellows&mdash;who earned their little at the ri&s;k of their lives&mdash;from agent to agent, till what they received was not worth hav|ing. To be &s;ure they might have &s;aved their journey; but they thought it was better to &s;ee into it them&s;elves than tru&s;t their affairs in the hands of tho&s;e land-&s;harks, the <HI>lawyers.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Sir ELIJAH IMPEY was on his pa&s;&s;age from INDIA, he continually kept in the cabin from indi&s;po&s;ition, while her lady&s;hip was in very good health and con&s;tantly on deck. One fine day &s;he coaxed him out to enjoy a little air, and as he was walking the deck&mdash;it having blowed pretty hard the preceding day&mdash;a <HI>&s;hark</HI> was playing by the &s;ide of the &s;hip. Having never &s;een &s;uch an object before, he called to one of the &s;ailors to tell him what it was.

<PB N="144" REF="151">
when his maje&s;ty&mdash;God ble&s;s him&mdash;came to know how the poor, hone&s;t fel|lows were &s;erved who manned his wooden-walls, &s;ome of the under&s;trappers would get a <HI>&s;alt eel.</HI></P>
<P>This was one in&s;tance, out of a great many, in which I have had oppor|tunity to notice the &s;trong intellectual feelings of &s;ailors. They are hone&s;t and liberal, to a proverb; and it has been remarked, that public depredators, who have gone to church to pick pockets, have been converted into good ci|tizens on the foreca&s;tle of a man of war. A friend of mine &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their ho|ne&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e are fully accounted for, by con&s;idering that they have very little commerce with mankind; owing to this they de&s;pi&s;e money, and therefore have no inducement to become knaves; and as their wants are few, and tho&s;e &s;oon &s;upplied, they have no occa&s;ion to rack imagina|tion to keep up a con&s;tant deception in their words and actions.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I lay I am &s;ure half an hour before I could form the mo&s;t di&s;tant conjecture of what this noi&s;e could proceed from. Bells, ket|tles, horns, hallowing, hooping, huzzaing, by men women and children, conveyed to my drow&s;y fancy a noi&s;e more horrible than did the angry billows which la&s;hed the yawning cavern of the &s;ix mouthed SCYLLA to the affrighted mariners of ULLUSSES, for I will not &s;uppo&s;e but that HE <HI>delighted in the danger.</HI></P>
<P>At length, by a few oblique words which catched my ear, I was let into the &s;ecret. It was the <HI>fifth of November,</HI> and the mob were carrying about a figure of GUY FAUX, which they informed me, when I came down to breakfa&s;t, was a ceremony performed on this day at LINCOLN with great <HI>regularity</HI> and <HI>&s;olemnity</HI>; and that there was al&s;o to be a bull-baiting at twelve o'clock, and another at four. I enquired particularly <HI>where,</HI> and was told if I wanted places to &s;ee it I mu&s;t be very expeditious, for they were not only dear, but perhaps all be&s;poke. My an&s;wer was, that I only a&s;ked that I might avoid &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ight. I received nothing but a contemptuous
<PB N="148" REF="155">
look for my declaration, and was extremely mortified to find that I unfortu|nately run into the very predicament I was &s;o &s;tudious to avoid; for though I did not &s;ee the bull <HI>baited,</HI> I was by accident &s;o hemmed in that I could not avoid witne&s;&s;ing the mi&s;erable lacerated condition of the poor creature afterwards&mdash;and they were then leading him to where he was to be again baited in the afternoon. Heavenly God! I have heard of &s;avages who have tortured their pri&s;oners and afterwards eat them&mdash;but I could find &s;omething like a motive for this. A bull is baited we are told to make him eat tender&mdash;let him be hunted then!&mdash;let him become the fair victim of the chace!&mdash;let us feel nobly like our ance&s;tors, nor degenerate from the brave EARL OF WARWICK by <HI>cruelly, cowardly</HI> tying a noble animal to the &s;take, and &s;timulating a number of peaceful dome&s;tic creatures to worry him, that human brutes may reli&s;h their dinner! I am told at STAMFORD they let the bull loo&s;e after baiting it&mdash;if &s;o, I mo&s;t &s;incerely hope the next time that event takes place he may to&s;s the fir&s;t man who &s;ets a dog at him. Lions <HI>tear</HI> their prey, Hy|enas <HI>betray</HI> it&mdash;but the&s;e are provoked only by the calls of hunger. But a wanton unnece&s;&s;ary cruelty&mdash;to which there cannot be a po&s;&s;ible incentive, but &s;avage hardne&s;s of heart&mdash;is a <HI>refinement</HI> on brutality re&s;erved alone for the ANIMAL OF REASON; and, to make the ca&s;e more lamentable, this mo&s;t contemptible of all unmanly pa&s;times is the peculiar di&s;grace of the brave&s;t nation upon earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>TOM CLOUGH&mdash;an under &s;trapper for many years at Drury-lane theatre&mdash;was the man of all others who had the true&s;t genuine ta&s;te for the Engli&s;h amu&s;ements.

<P>I performed at LINCOLN three nights&mdash;the &s;econd of which was tolera|bly well, but the fir&s;t and la&s;t mi&s;erably bad. Dr. KAYE was unfortunately,
<PB N="149" REF="156">
while I &s;tayed, but a few hours in town. He attended me, however, and had the goodne&s;s to &s;end me afterwards a polite invitation, which I am &s;orry I could not accept. Mr. MONEY, to whom I am almo&s;t wholly indebted for the little company I had, gave me proof of as liberal attention as I have any where met with. In &s;hort, I believe through that gentleman's means every body was a&s;ked, though &s;o very few cho&s;e to come. In the round of invita|tions, however, it would be an unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion if I neglected to men|tion the excu&s;e of one gentleman, with whom I <HI>think</HI> I had the honour of riding in the &s;tage coach to NEWARK. This gentleman was pre&s;&s;ed very hard to go to my entertainment, and would have been there, he &s;aid, with great plea&s;ure if there had been <HI>no mu&s;ic.</HI> I hope this gentleman is a <HI>bull baiter.</HI> At length, being very clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you know my <HI>dete&s;tation</HI> of <HI>mu&s;ic,</HI> and if you will only prevail on Mr. DIBDIN to introduce &s;omething <HI>to abu&s;e it,</HI> in order to give colour to my appearing there, I will go with all my heart."</Q> I hope it will be allowed that this is one of the mo&s;t cu|rious anecdotes I have yet recorded.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="157">I here pay my acknowledgements to Mr. VANEIL, to whom my friend SOUTHERN introduced me by letter, for his very kind attention to me both at LINCOLN and at NEWARK, in which he did honour to his friends recom|mendation, and to me particular &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t endeavour before I leave LINCOLN to account a little for the ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s I experienced. There is a <HI>high town</HI> and a <HI>low town,</HI> and they are as much at variance as the MONTAGUES and the CAPULETS. Thus, the place having &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and, taken aggregately, &s;tanding upon a very limited circumference, and containing but a &s;canty number of inhabitants, it is madne&s;s to think of an entertainment there. A playhou&s;e at LINCOLN I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t be in this predicament: if it was &s;ituate on the hill, it mu&s;t be all <HI>boxes</HI>&mdash;if under the hill, all <HI>gallery</HI>&mdash;and if in the mid-way, all <HI>pit</HI>&mdash;and as a playhou&s;e cannot live but by <HI>box, pit,</HI> and <HI>gallery</HI> COLLEC|TIVELY, I &s;hould conceive the la&s;t place for the drama in this kingdom is LINCOLN.</P>
<P>From LINCOLN I went to NEWARK, where I performed one night, to a very thin audience, who promi&s;ed great things if I would return in the cour&s;e of another week. This being in my power, I did &s;o, and met with no better &s;ucce&s;s. Upon &s;oliciting LADY LINCOLN, however, I received a mo&s;t generous and elegant an&s;wer, appointing a night, and giving me the liberty to make u&s;e of her name and LORD LINCOLN's. This produced me as good a night as I believe the place can afford, and manife&s;ted one in&s;tance&mdash;among many I have experienced&mdash;that <HI>real</HI> di&s;tinction dignifies it&s;elf by ea&s;y and amiable affability, while all the pride and o&s;tentation of affected con&s;e|quence&mdash;like a deformed figure con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;ituated&mdash;&s;olicits contempt; when, by a decent con&s;cious humiliation, it might command re&s;pect. But, it is the nature of folly to expo&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have ever remarked that the crooked women are always the fir&s;t to go without cloaks, the uglie&s;t to expo&s;e their faces, and tho&s;e with thick legs
<PB N="151" REF="158">
are &s;ure to wear &s;hort petticoats. I am returning to NEWARK, when I &s;hall illu&s;trate this and &s;ome other po&s;itions; in the mean time, beg your com|pany to NOTTINGHAM, where your warm wi&s;hes for my ill &s;ucce&s;s will be fully gratified; where little BURBAGE&mdash;after receiving a <HI>good price</HI> for the bills&mdash;could not help remarking that it was a damned &s;habby bu&s;ine&s;s. But I believe there is no more cau&s;e in nature for <HI>thick heads</HI> than <HI>hard hearts</HI>&mdash;therefore, let us blame not tho&s;e who do not enjoy the plea&s;ures of good-fellow&s;hip and &s;ociality equal to our&s;elves, but rather thank providence for giving us the charming enjoyment of that &s;ort of &s;en&s;ation I feel when I tell you I am,</P>

Who, for in&s;tance, would have believed that <HI>genteel</HI> DERBY &s;hould, on my return, have &s;erved me as &s;curvy a trick as <HI>&s;habby</HI> NOTTINGHAM. I had the folly to linger on three nights, each of which was to be great things, and turned out nothing at all.</P>
<P>Let me, however, before I mention the particulars of the&s;e matters, bring you up&mdash;as the &s;ailors &s;ay&mdash;as to the time and place. My fir&s;t night at NEWARK was on the tenth of November. I then went to NOTTINGHAM, had one night, proceeded to DERBY, and returned to NEWARK to perform on the <HI>&s;eventeenth</HI>&mdash;then, to give opportunity for the night be&s;poke by LADY LINCOLN, I went to GRANTHAM, and returned to NEWARK for the per|formance on the <HI>twenty-fourth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="160">I found DERBY &s;plit into factions in con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new a&s;&s;embly, the etiquette of which could not be &s;ettled to the general &s;atisfaction. One lady was de&s;irous of being queen or conductre&s;s, and this gave offence to the re&s;t. Thus, the partizans of Mrs. A. turned up their no&s;es at the friends of Mrs. B. while Mrs. C&mdash;who&s;e adherents were al&s;o nume|rous&mdash;retorted the contempt upon them both, and in her turn was &s;aluted with a whole volly of gibes and &s;arca&s;ms by the &s;taunch abettors of Mrs. D. A decent poet might have picked up &s;omething tolerable among them for &s;atires and lampoons. How it operated with me is very apparent. Water and oil&mdash;fire and ice&mdash;modern mu&s;ic and genius&mdash;could not be more inimical than were the&s;e parties to each other. If I would have performed four times in the day, I might have had them all &s;eparately; but together! no con&s;ideration upon earth could have induced them to mix. One lady certainly did trifle with me in a &s;trange kind of way&mdash;but as no longer ago than ye&s;terday I received intelligence that &s;he &s;ub&s;cribes for four copies, I &s;hould hope matters were mi&s;repre&s;ented to me; for as to her unea&s;ine&s;s le&s;t I &s;hould introduce her into my TOUR&mdash;which has al&s;o been hinted&mdash;I cannot &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has any apprehen&s;ions on that account. To be &s;ure her conduct was a good deal like the ladies at BATH; &s;he did appoint a time for me when nobody could be there, and afterwards made me keep a company waiting more than an hour, under an idea that &s;he was coming at the head of a large party&mdash;and, at length, &s;ent word that neither they nor her could attend me&mdash;though &s;he knew the performance of that night was an additional one in compliment to her.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t curious treatment I met with at DERBY was from old &s;urly DREWRY, the printer. This gro&s;&s;ly ignorant <HI>man of letters</HI> took it into his head&mdash;becau&s;e I thought proper to pay &s;ome attention to Mr. PRITCHARD, who was once under him, and to whom he cannot have the &s;malle&s;t objec|tion, except that he begins very fa&s;t to take away his cu&s;tom&mdash;to be offended; and the method he took of &s;hewing his re&s;entment was to charge half-a-crown a hundred for the &s;ame &s;ort of bills which he had printed the fir&s;t time I was
<PB N="154" REF="161">
there for eighteen-pence. I really thought an <HI>advance</HI> of forty per cent, even in &s;o trifling a bu&s;ine&s;s, was worth a remon&s;trance. This was what he wanted. He boiled with rage, and the truth came out. I a&s;ked him how he would like to be put in the TOUR. <Q REND="inline">"Damme,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"clap me up in your <HI>Tower</HI> at your peril."</Q> I told him I always did what I was dared to; and here he may perceive I am as good as my word. My di&s;covery, however, has nothing new in it&mdash;his overbearing, pur&s;e-proud ignorant con&s;equence, are as much known in DERBY, as the accommodating, mode&s;t, and obliging behaviour of MR. PRITCHARD&mdash;the object of his envy&mdash;and it will have this operation: in proportion as one grows malicious, the other will be pro&s;perous. I mention this circum&s;tance with &s;ome regret, as it is the only in&s;tance of incivility I have, to this day, met with from printers. To <HI>all</HI> I am indebted for &s;ome kindne&s;s; to MANY for much civility and kind attention; and to SOME FEW for a liberality and friendly &s;olicitude which will ever make the warme&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion on me; even little BURBAGE&mdash;as far as it con&s;i&s;ts with a <HI>money get|ting man</HI>&mdash;I &s;incerely believe would do any thing to &s;erve me.</P>
<P>I returned to NEWARK on Friday the twenty-&s;ixth, and took up my abode with hone&s;t, worthy JEMMY WALLIS, who keeps the <HI>Wing Tavern</HI> and makes <HI>monuments</HI>&mdash;being at once employed on <HI>fea&s;ting the living,</HI> and <HI>com|memorating the dead.</HI> Nor is he more inadequate to one than the other: his <HI>cellar</HI> is as full of <HI>good wine</HI> as his <HI>head</HI> of <HI>ta&s;ty</HI> and <HI>neat ornaments.</HI> But as no man is better beloved, or &s;tudied to do me more friendly offices, &s;o my panegyric, even were it twenty times as &s;trong, will an&s;wer no other pur|po&s;e than that of doing common ju&s;tice to a valuable character. Some indeed may blame me for telling the world of the merits of a man only particularly known at NEWARK&mdash;and cry out&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what is Mr. WALLIS's wine to me, who &s;hall never drink any of it.'</Q> Sir RICHARD STEEL had his ESTCOURT, and why &s;hould not I have my WALLIS? No ESTCOURT upon earth ever de|&s;erved to be better &s;poken of. The only difference is, the two pens are not alike equal to the ta&s;k, which certainly is not an unworthy one, for it has
<PB N="155" REF="162">
drawn from the editor of the <HI>Spectator</HI>&mdash;in that nervous touching eulogium which he concludes with &s;aying the pen drops out of his hand&mdash;one of the brighte&s;t effu&s;ions of his genius. It is true this beautiful glowing tribute of warm friend&s;hip to private worth deplores the <HI>death</HI> of ESTCOURT, while WALLIS&mdash;though every day recording the decea&s;ed virtues of others&mdash;keeps a &s;tate of robu&s;t health that &s;eems, like a towering elm, to defy the depre|dations of time.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of my jaunt to GRANTHAM&mdash;during the preparation for LADY LINCOLN's night&mdash;was this: I took a letter to a gentleman, who told me he could do me no manner of &s;ervice; and in particular, that he could not be pre&s;ent on the fir&s;t night of my performance. Finding, how|ever, that LORD and LADY BROWNLOW and &s;ome other people of di&s;tinction were there, he came al&s;o; but advi&s;ed me not to have another night till the following week; to which I did <HI>not</HI> con&s;ent. He, however, propagated that I <HI>did,</HI> and in con&s;equence nobody attended. This gentleman's kind conduct was owing to his being director of the GRANTHAM concert, and it is evi|dent he feared that if I drew too much company, <HI>his</HI> appearance would be but thin.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT GRANTHAM, on the 22d of November, I received a letter from Mr. HARRIS, the contents of which I &s;hall defer mentioning till I go over that matter regularly. Before I left NEWARK for GRANTHAM, in order to accommodate LORD and LADY LINCOLN, I made an application re&s;pectively to the corporation for u&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly room; and having obtained leave <HI>individually,</HI> I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find, on my return, that <HI>collectively</HI> they objected to it. In con&s;equence of this, I found my&s;elf unplea&s;antly &s;ituated. I was relieved, however, from my anxiety by Mr. MIDGELEY, who keeps the <HI>King&s;ton Arms</HI>; the hi&s;tory of which hou&s;e, in a former letter, I promi&s;ed to give in its place. Mr. MIDCELEY offered to let me have his large room gratis, and I accepted the offer; in con&s;equence of which I fancy he expects to be &s;poken very well of in this publication, and hand&s;omely recommended to the notice of <HI>people of fa&s;hion,</HI> who&s;e ac|commodation&mdash;to the great annoyance of <HI>&s;tage-coach travellers</HI> and <HI>bagmen</HI>&mdash;he very anxiou&s;ly &s;tudies. I &s;hall, however, go no &s;tep further than the truth to oblige all the Mr. MIDGELEYS upon earth. And the truth is this: When I fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through NEWARK&mdash;as I mention in its place&mdash;I ate a dinner re|markably
<PB N="157" REF="164">
well dre&s;&s;ed, and in con&s;equence returned to the &s;ame hou&s;e. I then found that the landlord had been cook to the PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES, and that the hou&s;e was famous for culinary excellence. I therefore indulged my&s;elf in two or three favourite di&s;hes, the merits of which I &s;o loudly chaunted the prai&s;e of&mdash;having eaten them in perfection in FRANCE&mdash;that he, I &s;uppo&s;e, fancied me UN MY LOR. Finding, however, I was&mdash;according to the mayor of NOTTINGHAM&mdash;only an <HI>actor man,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, by what followed, he was determined to be revenged of me for being in|nocently the cau&s;e of his paying me a little re&s;pect. He therefore gave me a mi&s;erable bad pair of hor&s;es to NOTTINGHAM, one of which fell down, and detained me half an hour on the road; and though he promi&s;ed that he would very faithfully take care of any letters that might be directed for me to his hou&s;e, yet he refu&s;ed &s;ome that were brought in my ab&s;ence, which, but for the kindne&s;s of JEMMY WALLIS, I &s;hould not&mdash;without great difficulty&mdash;have received. When he found LORD and LADY LINCOLN had be&s;poke a night, the tables were turned again, and it was impo&s;&s;ible, with all his con&s;equence, to put on a more ful&s;ome &s;hew of adulation. If he thought this was the way to procure my prai&s;e, he will find, by reading the above, how far he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>NEWARK, like MALTON, in &s;ome degree failed, owing to my having imprudently placed my dependance on a <HI>par&s;on</HI> and a <HI>lawyer</HI>; but, in return, I became acquainted with another attorney, who paid me much attention, and without an intere&s;ted motive; I therefore record the circum&s;tance accord|ing to my promi&s;e, as one of tho&s;e which in all my life&mdash;much le&s;s during my tour&mdash;I have &s;eldom had the good fortune to meet with.</P>
<P>On Sunday the twenty-fifth I arrived at DONCASTER, and that evening paid my re&s;pects to Dr. MILLER. I own I had nohopes of this place, and if I had entertained any, they would have been baulked&mdash;for it was like DERBY,
<PB N="158" REF="165">
divided into parties: each of which &s;eemed determined to deprive it&s;elf of its own plea&s;ure rather than not di&s;turb the tranquillity of its neighbour.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance in country towns of de&s;troying that &s;ociality which they &s;eem &s;o peculiarly &s;ituated for the enjoyment of, is a&s;toni&s;hing. Some au|thor mentions a circum&s;tance of four per&s;ons who were going to the land's end in a &s;tage coach. The fir&s;t twenty miles they all &s;poke together; further on they were the be&s;t friends in the world, but were content with &s;peaking one at a time; pre&s;ently they all yawned; by and by fell a&s;leep; and, before they parted, cordially wi&s;hed one another at the devil. Now all this is natural enough. The&s;e people were never to meet again. But the fir&s;t idea of &s;ettling in the country is a &s;ociable neighbourhood; and, as tho&s;e who are &s;o &s;ituated mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be near each other during a number of dull months, common policy would induce them, one &s;hould think, to give and receive as much rational plea&s;ure as po&s;&s;ible. But pride attends every &s;ituation in life. Mrs. DOUBLE TRIPE, the cook, looks with contempt on the &s;cullion. Mrs. HANDY, my lady's maid, addre&s;&s;es Mrs. DOUBLE TRIPE by the title of <HI>good woman.</HI> Mrs. CRINGE, the toad-eater, &s;neers &s;upercili|ou&s;ly at Mrs. HANDY; while &s;he, in her turn, is huffed and dinged about by My LADY, and blamed for putting her out of humour, &s;poiling her complexion, and lo&s;ing her lovers. A <HI>corporal</HI> is as proud of relieving a <HI>centinal</HI> as a <HI>general</HI> of commanding an <HI>army,</HI> and a <HI>&s;trolling actor</HI> is as much a monarch for the time being as the EMPEROR of GERMANY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fooli&s;h <HI>&s;tage-&s;truck</HI> young man ran away from his friends, and got among a mo&s;t low and mi|&s;erable &s;et of &s;trollers. A relation, after a time, di&s;covered him ju&s;t as he was going on to the &s;tage in KING RICHARD; and, on reading him a pretty &s;evere lecture on his folly and di&s;obedience, received an an&s;wer &s;uitable to all the ridiculous con&s;equence and a&s;&s;umed pomp of a mock monarch. To which he an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the&s;e are fine lofty words but 'tis a great pity, Mr. KING RICHARD, that you could not afford to buy a better pair of &s;hoes.'</Q> The actor looking at his toes, which were &s;taring him in the face&mdash;without loo&s;ing his vivacity&mdash;cried out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hoes!&mdash;Oh damme, &s;hoes are things we KINGS don't STAND UPON."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">At DONCASTER the ladies of independent fortune had e&s;tabli&s;hed an a&s;&s;embly, and finding on a former occa&s;ion they were intruded on by others of inferior di&s;tinction, they came to a re&s;olution of admitting no trade&s;|man nor any of his family to the a&s;&s;embly. This of cour&s;e gave umbrage to the major part of the place, who, in return, determined to have an a&s;&s;embly apart. Here for a little time the matter re&s;ted, and it mu&s;t have been no un|plea&s;ant thing to &s;ee the lower hou&s;e mu&s;ter numerou&s;ly, when the upper hou&s;e could get &s;carcely any members to attend it. At length this &s;econd a&s;&s;embly began to divide. Mi&s;s LATITAT, the attorney's daughter, made Mrs. FRIZ, the barber's wife, no <HI>return</HI> to her curt&s;ey; while Mrs. PTISIC, the phy&s;ician's lady, &s;neered at the up&s;tart con&s;equence of Mi&s;s BUMPER, the innkeeper's daughter, and wondered that &s;he &s;hould have the impudence to <HI>precribe</HI> rules of good breeding to her.

All this would have been the con&s;equence at NEWARK, which LADY LINCOLN very &s;en&s;ibly fore&s;eeing&mdash;with an ami|able complacency truly noble&mdash;headed the a&s;&s;embly, and di&s;pen&s;ed her favours with &s;o equal a hand, that it cau&s;ed every where an emulation&mdash;not to a&s;&s;ume fal&s;e con&s;equence, but imitate true greatne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOGENES being a&s;ked how he could live in a <HI>na&s;ty tub,</HI> when he might ba&s;k in the favour of a <HI>court,</HI> replied&mdash;It is true I am deprived of the &s;miles of KINGS, but I don't find the <HI>&s;un</HI> is more a&s;ham|ed of my <HI>tub</HI> than a <HI>palace.</HI></NOTE></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall trouble you with nothing concerning the en|tertainment at DONCASTER, which I did but twice&mdash;each time to a lo&s;s. Not, however, to be incon&s;i&s;tent, I &s;tick to my a&s;&s;ertion, that my plan began to brighten up at DONCASTER. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ub&s;cription went on pretty fa&s;t, and I received &s;uch good intelligence from WAKEFIELD, LEEDS, and other places, that I could no longer doubt of good &s;ucce&s;s. Be&s;ides, DONCASTER introduced me to the intimacy of Dr. MILLER and the counte|nance of Mr. DRUMMOND, who I &s;incerely hope will not be offended if, according to my pur&s;uit of common ju&s;tice, I take the liberty to &s;peak of him. It is not, however, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much&mdash;for, when it is known that a clergyman is venerated by his neighbourhood&mdash;that the poor among his pari&s;hioners look up to him as a father&mdash;that he is the benefactor of merit&mdash;the comforter of the helple&s;s&mdash;that born largely to enjoy the promi&s;cuous ble&s;&s;ings of life, his &s;ole delight is the rational and enchanting plea&s;ures centered in the amiable duties of a hu&s;band and a father&mdash;and then add that this ex|ample of human perfection is no more than <HI>twenty-&s;ix</HI>&mdash;I believe it will be pretty difficult to advance any thing &s;tronger on the &s;ubject. I cannot, however, debar my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of relating one circum&s;tance&mdash;in corro|boration
<PB N="161" REF="168">
of the above&mdash;which happened while I was there. The &s;mall pox&mdash;of a confluent and fatal kind&mdash;had raged very violently and was continually &s;weeping off numbers of the inhabitants&mdash;Mr. DRUMMOND having attended &s;everal burials, determined to &s;top, as much as in his power, the progre&s;s of this alarming evil, preached a &s;ermon full of good &s;en&s;e and &s;trong feeling, in favour of inoculation, and afterwards proclaimed that tho&s;e who cho&s;e to have their children inoculated might do &s;o at his expence. So blind, however, is human folly, that but nine applied while I &s;tayed. One poor woman being a&s;ked why &s;he did not avail her&s;elf of Mr. DRUMMOND's goodne&s;s, an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I thank God, my children are all ble&s;&s;ed angels in heaven!'</Q></P>
<P>I was in the whole a week at DONCASTER, which I pa&s;&s;ed very happily, in the company of Dr. MILLER. I know no man of more liberal &s;entiments, nor who&s;e &s;tudies are applied to more worthy purpo&s;es. His public letter concerning the <HI>mu&s;ical fund,</HI> and advice towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch an in&s;titution in the country, is full of generous, &s;pirited, and &s;en&s;ible re|marks; and it will do him la&s;ting honour that his plan has already been in &s;ome mea&s;ure adopted. His in&s;titutes are another proof of his wi&s;hes to make his abilities of public u&s;e. They are a work calculated to reduce the &s;tudy of mu&s;ic to &s;omething like rule, in the nature of a grammar; and for a fir&s;t attempt in this way&mdash;for he was very con&s;cious that any thing of &s;uch a kind would be con&s;idered as a dangerous innovation&mdash;has great per&s;picuity, and may be made generally &s;erviceable. But here I mu&s;t tell Dr. MILLER and the public a &s;ecret. The ma&s;ters, as they are called, fearing their my&s;teries &s;hould be revealed, which, like the glorious uncertainty of the law, is the &s;ource of emolument, decry this work of his whenever they can, and make their &s;cholars believe it is only capable of teaching them a few &s;uperficial rules; whereas their whole fear is, le&s;t it draw a&s;ide the veil of impo&s;ition, and di&s;cover that deception by which they contrive to lead on a &s;cholar, in the cour&s;e of two or three years, to the knowledge of what they might, upon a plain, ea&s;y, &s;imple principle, accompli&s;h in a few weeks. His elements of thorough ba&s;s is ano|ther
<PB N="162" REF="169">
ingenious work. He &s;eems to have kept RAMEAU &s;trongly in mind, and he could not&mdash;tempered with his own ob&s;ervations&mdash;have had a better model. I am only &s;orry he did not keep to tho&s;e u&s;eful po&s;itions which &s;o dumb-found theori&s;ts, as they are called&mdash;&s;uch as maintaining that there is not in the &s;y&s;tem of harmony any thing more than the common chord and the &s;eventh&mdash;&s;ince by &s;hewing how ab&s;tru&s;e re&s;olutions may be made, every man will not take the matter upon the ground of its being a &s;evere &s;atire on <HI>mere</HI> profe&s;&s;ors, but &s;uppo&s;e he countenances the introduction of &s;uch chords. It is certain his book would have tended more to &s;implify harmony without it. But then he would have had all the cavillers, in full cry after him&mdash;and every man is not obliged to &s;et him&s;elf the Herculean ta&s;k of a reformer. He therefore gave them two roads, which&mdash;like tho&s;e of virtue and vice&mdash;one is flowery and the other rugged. Perhaps he did wi&s;ely. Tho&s;e who would be plea&s;ed with little trouble will chu&s;e <HI>&s;implicity</HI> for their guide&mdash;tho&s;e who would &s;earch and never come to the end of their journey will follow <HI>difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot introduce <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> &s;o well&mdash;for I confe&s;s to you I mean now to dwell &s;ome time on that &s;ubject&mdash;as by a de&s;cription of <HI>mu&s;icians</HI>; nor <HI>mu&s;i|cians,</HI> as by &s;peaking of the <HI>mu&s;ical fund.</HI> This in&s;titution is too well known to need a &s;tatement of its origin, ri&s;e, and progre&s;s. The new&s;papers give frequent accounts of the thou&s;ands which are continually pouring into its coffers. But does any one know what becomes of them? Is &s;uch an in&s;titution worthy the benevolent contribution of hundreds, and the augu&s;t patronage of a great, powerful&mdash;and what is more, incomparably more&mdash;a good and bene|ficent monarch, which &s;uffers the neglected du&s;t of the matchle&s;s ARNE to lie without a &s;tone to tell where it peri&s;hes? Who can &s;uppre&s;s his indigna|tion when he con&s;iders that the widow of this great man&mdash;old and friendle&s;s&mdash;applied to this &s;ociety&mdash;&s;o &s;upported, &s;o patronized&mdash;and went away with the tear of di&s;tre&s;s on her check, &s;tarted by the language of reproof? And what think ye was the excu&s;e for this unfeeling refu&s;al? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Dr. ARNE had been, it was true, one of the mo&s;t ancient members of the mu&s;ical fund; he had

<P>The widow of MICHAEL ARNE applied with as little &s;ucce&s;s. There was &s;omething in this ca&s;e whi&s;pered about difference of opinion in religion. If it be true, it can only be &s;aid that the be&s;t names may be pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es. It is curious, at any rate, to talk of the religious &s;enti|ments of mu&s;icians. Harmony, in its exten&s;ive and univer&s;al acceptation, is certainly allied to a contemplation of that great and expanded &s;ymmetry and grace which &s;o wonderfully qualify and knit together the various contra|rieties on the face of nature, through the influence of contending elements, into one concordant whole&mdash;but for the members of the mu&s;ical fund to draw an inference from the &s;imilitude of mu&s;ic to moral or revealed religion&mdash;li&s;ten to the calls of humanity&mdash;or, indeed, make any u&s;e of their &s;tock except to relieve their tools and gratify their own luxurious plea&s;ures&mdash;would be a &s;pecies of harmony beyond their capacity; for it is founded in <HI>nature,</HI> it opens to <HI>benevolence,</HI> and <HI>modulating</HI> through all the fine and exqui&s;ite feelings of nice honour and &s;miling philanthropy, it clo&s;es in that be&s;t of <HI>keys</HI>&mdash;the HEART.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DR. MILLER addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, in his fir&s;t letter, to the noblemen and gentlemen managers of the different fe&s;tivals in comme|moration of HANDEL, praying that the mu&s;icians in the country, as well as tho&s;e re&s;ident in LONDON, may be entitled to &s;ome relief from that fund which their labours help to accumulate. He truly &s;ays, that charity ought not to be confined to any particular place; and urges a variety of &s;trong argu|ments to &s;upport his laudable purpo&s;e. His &s;econd letter is to the directors of <HI>the fund</HI> it&s;elf&mdash;whom he advi&s;es to admit regular country mu&s;icians as mem|bers. He &s;trenuou&s;ly appeals to their feelings as men and profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame art&mdash;in&s;tances the numerous charities for who&s;e emolument mu&s;icians perform gratis. He exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unfortunate profe&s;&s;ors of a noble &s;cience! Unhappy &s;ons of an unnatural parent! who, while &s;he procures wealth and comfort to others, &s;uffers her own children to pine in mi&s;ery and want!"</Q></P>
<P>This effort to procure relief for country mu&s;icians is however as extrava|gantly ab&s;urd, as it is nobly liberal. What have the noblemen and gentlemen to do with di&s;pen&s;ing the profit of the Abbey fe&s;tivals? It is &s;ifted as often
<PB N="166" REF="173">
as flour, and&mdash;according to hone&s;t JOE&mdash;it would be wonderful if &s;ome of it did not &s;tick by the way. I have had very particular opportunity to notice, that if nothing el&s;e di&s;graces the king's patronage in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fe&s;ti|vals, the paltry haggling bargains that are made with the country mu&s;icians&mdash;and all in the names of the&s;e noblemen and gentlemen who know nothing about it&mdash;are a &s;candal to any &s;et of men who boa&s;t the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to exerci&s;e a liberal profe&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, it is&mdash;like every thing of that kind&mdash;a job. And how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? In&s;tead of placing at the head of it &s;uch men as Dr. HAYES and Dr. BURNEY, the power is ve&s;ted in &s;ub|ordinate mu&s;icians; who, like COLONEL COCKBURN, never get rid of the <HI>black hole,</HI> the <HI>gin,</HI> and the <HI>cat-o'nine-tails.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>noble commander,</HI> becau&s;e he could not conceal it, was continually boa&s;ting of his ri&s;e from a private man. His con&s;tant expre&s;&s;ion was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"did you ever &s;ee me do &s;o and &s;o when I was a private &s;oldier."</Q> One day, in the i&s;land of St. EUSTATIUS, as he was reviewing the troops, he took no|tice of a man in the ranks who was very dirty. Going up to him&mdash;&s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How dare you appear in that na&s;ty condition&mdash;your &s;hirt's as black as ink! Did you ever &s;ee me with &s;uch a dirty &s;hirt?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, your honour'</Q> an&s;wered the man, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to be &s;ure, your honour, I never did&mdash;but then, your ho|nour will plea&s;e to recollect, that your honour's mother&mdash;<HI>was a wa&s;her woman!</HI>'</Q></NOTE> And the&s;e, by this appointment, are to dictate to men under who&s;e command common policy &s;ays they ought to march. Can any thing therefore be &s;o futile and ineffectual as an attempt to turn &s;uch a tide as this&mdash;over which the&s;e men are the moon, and con|trive to influence it into that channel where it can ebb and flow at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As to the letter to the directors of the fund it&s;elf, how could a man of Dr MILLER's good &s;en&s;e expect to have it noticed? Will a mi&s;er &s;pare a &s;ingle guinea out of his iron che&s;t to &s;ave a life, or a drunkard a &s;ingle drop out of his pint bumper?

I have always thought that there is nothing like making a man tell his own &s;tory. It is the moment of all others when his heart is mo&s;t to be &s;een. His habits, manners, affections, and foibles, are then &s;o expo&s;ed that a tolerably &s;agacious ob&s;erver may very ea&s;ily di&s;cover the &s;pot where he is mo&s;t vulnerable; be|&s;ides, it is unfair to rob a man's expre&s;&s;ions of any of their brilliancy.

The in&s;tance above is one of the &s;tronge&s;t I &s;hall have the nece&s;&s;ity to adduce. There is a language or lingo in LONDON, in the opinion of rhe|toricians, of a very beautiful kind&mdash;for it is entirely figurative&mdash;called SLANG. This PATTER&mdash;which is another of its names&mdash;is frequently in the mouths of mu&s;icians, who, by imitating the inhabitants of St. GILES's&mdash;whence this elegant improvement on the vulgar tongue boa&s;ts its origin&mdash;in their man|ners, debaucheries, and even the <HI>compilation</HI> of NEW MUSIC, adopt al&s;o their very mode of expre&s;&s;ion. I will not pretend to &s;ay that I &s;hall always make my&s;elf perfectly clear; but when I find I cannot, I &s;hall have for con&s;olation the recollection that one of the&s;e St. GILES's birds once &s;o confounded LORD MANSFIELD, that he was obliged to let him go, without being able to gather any thing from his evi|dence;&mdash;but then this gentleman was an <HI>adept,</HI> whereas mu&s;icians, neither in language nor any thing el&s;e, a&s;pire to more than <HI>imitation.</HI> The trial was concerning &s;ome quarrel in the &s;treet, and the KIDDY&mdash;the gentleman's <HI>&s;lang name</HI>&mdash;was to give an account of all he knew. <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> &s;aid he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my Lord, as I was coming by the corner of the &s;treet, I <HI>&s;tagged</HI> the man."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pray,'</Q> &s;aid LORD MANS|FIELD, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what is <HI>&s;tagging</HI> a man?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Stagging,</HI> my Lord, why you &s;ee, I was <HI>down upon him.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well, but I don't under&s;tand <HI>down upon him</HI> any more than I do <HI>&s;tagging</HI> him.

It was moved and carried that Mr. SMART had endeavoured to get admi&s;&s;ion as a member of the <HI>mu&s;ical fund</HI> by &s;urreptitious means, and, therefore &s;hould never be entitled to any benefit from it.</P>
<P>It was after this tran&s;action that Dr. MILLER's letter got into Mr. SMART's hands; he con&s;ulted a few others, and, by dint of a laudable per&s;e|verance, a NEW FUND is actually e&s;tabli&s;hed, which already con&s;i&s;ts of a decent &s;um, and has the &s;anction of many gentlemen of both worldly&mdash;as well as profe&s;&s;ional&mdash;rank and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>This letter will rou&s;e the charitable mu&s;icians more than all the rods with which I mean to tingle them hereafter: but I defy them to controvert it. Dr. HOWARD has an hundred times declared that it was an iniquitous

<Q>"<HI>From harmony&mdash;from heavenly harmony&mdash;the univer&s;al frame began!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEAVING DONCASTER, I went, by invitation, to WAKEFIELD; where, having &s;ome lei&s;ure, I threw a few loo&s;e thoughts on paper concerning mu&s;ic&mdash;which can no where come &s;o properly as in this letter.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers truly &s;ay that even the minute&s;t objects have place on the &s;cale of univer&s;al harmony; and&mdash;&s;pite of VOLTAIRE's PLATO's <HI>Demiurgos</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is almo&s;t unne&s;&s;ary to &s;ay I allude to PLATO's dream on general good and evil, which having related to his &s;cholars, and harrangued them for a con&s;iderable time, on the &s;ubject of it, till he and they are tired&mdash;one of them yawning, cries out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and &s;o then I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;<HI>you awoke.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>&mdash;nettles and toads are not without their u&s;e. But it does not follow that men are to be continually peeping into the holes and corners of nature for objects that cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;atisfy a &s;ingle &s;en&s;ation but curio&s;ity, which even in its gratification will be accompanied with di&s;gu&s;t. The&s;e po&s;itions mi|nutely hold good in relation to mu&s;ic. Di&s;cords are &s;aid to be the &s;oul of harmony; which&mdash;if this declaration be admitted&mdash;mu&s;t be, according to POLONIUS, very unlike <HI>wit</HI>; di&s;cords being the very rever&s;e of <HI>brevity.</HI> So much indeed are they the limbs and outward flouri&s;hes, that one would think they were introduced to <HI>bewilder</HI> what they ought to <HI>elucidate.</HI> Yet fear not,
<PB N="172" REF="179">
ye mere harmoni&s;ts, but I &s;hall allow that di&s;cords have their u&s;e; but dare not to think of them otherwi&s;e than as the <HI>&s;piders</HI> and <HI>hemloc</HI> of mu&s;ic, or that they are more material to the <HI>&s;oul of harmony</HI> than tho&s;e noxious objects to the univer&s;al <HI>&s;y&s;tem of nature.</HI></P>
<P>Speaking to men of common &s;en&s;e, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to addre&s;s my|&s;elf to more than one out of twenty mu&s;icians. Nor am I a&s;hamed or afraid of making the declaration. No man need be a&s;hamed of telling the truth; and for the fear&mdash;the whole twenty will re&s;pectively believe them&s;elves alluded to by the above exception; in which ca&s;e I &s;hall be thanked rather than blamed: for where is the man&mdash;a mu&s;ician e&s;pecially&mdash;who will not chuckle at even an imaginary hit at his neighbour.</P>
<P>To expre&s;s my&s;elf le&s;s archly, and probably more to the point. What I am going to &s;ay relative to harmony &s;hall, or I have lo&s;t my aim, apply to all men who have under&s;tandings, be they mu&s;icians or not mu&s;icians; and as it is a &s;ubject on which a great deal has been both &s;aid and done to very little purpo&s;e&mdash;as it has opened, as far as it goes, as many doors to impo&s;ition as law or prie&s;tcraft, and as been as conducive to picking of pockets as a &s;emi|nary at St. GILES's&mdash;I conceive it my duty at lea&s;t to attempt a reform.</P>
<P>If ever term had a po&s;itive implication, the etymology of the word mu&s;ic is&mdash;to <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> to <HI>charm,</HI> to <HI>delight.</HI> Mr. HERON, the critic, if he felt what I do at this moment, would &s;ay&mdash;I will &s;purn at common rules, and change&mdash;the better to expre&s;s my&s;elf&mdash;this <HI>&s;ub&s;tantive</HI> mu&s;ic into a <HI>verb,</HI> and conjugate it through all the moods and ten&s;es. It is true, mu&s;ic may excite horror, but then it is a mimic horror, which has its delectable effects. The <HI>ear</HI> is the door of the heart&mdash;and I will venture to pronounce there is no <HI>perfect</HI> mu&s;ic but that which is <HI>plea&s;ing.</HI> The demonstration is clear: nothing can be <HI>perfect</HI> that is <HI>incomplete.</HI> Mere <HI>harmony</HI> is incomplete, for it is a BODY to which <HI>melody</HI> is the SOUL. <HI>Ergo&mdash;mere harmony</HI> is not <HI>perfect mu&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">The Engli&s;h, from their natural goodne&s;s of heart, take upon hear&s;ay a man's abilities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am no judge&mdash;I can't &s;ay I heard any thing &s;triking in &s;uch an air&mdash;but the man has great reputation, and of cour&s;e his mu&s;ic is good&mdash;though I mu&s;t confe&s;s it does not &s;eem to me to be very plea&s;ing."</Q> Let this for ever decide upon &s;uch &s;ort of judgment&mdash;</P>
<P>If a man have a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with mu&s;ic&mdash;though he be totally ignorant of it as a &s;cience&mdash;if he can point out what air has ever given him real plea&s;ure&mdash;which he mu&s;t be qualified to do if he has heard the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> or <HI>Comus</HI>&mdash;if &s;uch a man &s;hould li&s;ten with attention a fir&s;t, a &s;econd, and a third time to an air, and yet cannot feel a delight capable of the cleare&s;t explanation&mdash;and heaven knows that may ea&s;ily be now a days!&mdash;that mu&s;ic de&s;erves to be burnt, even though HANDEL were the compo&s;er. This rule, however, is liable to &s;ome correction. <HI>Original</HI> mu&s;ic will never &s;trike at fir&s;t equal to what it will upon repetition; &s;o that original com|po&s;ers&mdash;and indeed &s;o do writers&mdash;run the mo&s;t ri&s;que. Care therefore ought to be had to examine whether it is from the &s;tile of the mu&s;ic the hearer can|not immediately decide. The infallible way, however, is to hear the air repeatedly&mdash;and if at length it catch hold of the heart, the trouble is well recompen&s;ed by the plea&s;ure it will ever afterwards afford.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame token, let not the auditor form a <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> judgment. A fami|liar air jigging upon the ear may be <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> but it will, mo&s;t probably, be <HI>&s;tolen</HI>; in which ca&s;e, it can be entitled only to an illegitimate reputation; and&mdash;like a pre&s;ent imitation of GARRICK&mdash;though ever &s;o perfect, &s;erve only to make us regret that the incomparable original&mdash;<HI>is no more!</HI></P>
<P>Any man with an ear and a heart, made rather of more penetrable &s;tuff than the gentleman at LINCOLN, may venture to pronounce his opinion on MUSIC. I do not, however, mean tho&s;e carping, cavilling critics, who, as it were, take the dimen&s;ions of &s;ounds, and go about to explain their excellence
<PB N="174" REF="181">
as methodically as they would to bore a cylinder or weigh air. The&s;e have <HI>ears</HI> too, but they are, like that of DIONYSIUS, <HI>expanded</HI> to di&s;cover&mdash;<HI>all the faults.</HI></P>
<P>Let not, therefore, any one be deterred from freely giving his &s;entiments, after having con&s;ulted his heart. Harmony is not intended to conceal the beauties of mu&s;ic, but to round and perfect them; and men may as well talk of a <HI>picture</HI> without an <HI>outline,</HI> as <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> without <HI>air.</HI> In &s;hort, all the labyrinth of harmony may be mechanically explored, but melody is that charm from which mu&s;ic receives animation, which cannot be attained by the art of man, but is an intuitive principle derived from nature. I do not un|der&s;tand the text&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"from harmony, from heavenly harmony, the univer&s;al frame began."</Q> It could not be harmony till it was completed. From a chaos of &s;ounds men of brilliant fancy and good ta&s;te &s;elect a certain number, and model them into form and order:&mdash;for it cannot be denied that a &s;ong is as perfectly under&s;tood with a &s;ingle voice as accompanied by a band.&mdash;<HI>Harmony</HI> &s;erves to <HI>ornament</HI> and <HI>&s;et off</HI> the <HI>melody,</HI> but cannot do more. In &s;hort, <HI>melody</HI> is the <HI>naked figure,</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> the <HI>dre&s;s</HI>&mdash;which now a-days is as fanta&s;tical and ridiculous as the clothes of men and women&mdash;and believe I need not &s;ay any thing &s;tronger to prove that harmony &s;hould contain nothing but what is <HI>neat, convenient,</HI> and <HI>graceful,</HI> which every body under&s;tands. <HI>Ergo</HI> every body is mu&s;ician enough to be a mu&s;ical critic; and thus the &s;tupid non&s;en&s;e of theori&s;ts ought for ever to be &s;ilenced:&mdash;but there would be as much difficulty to do that, as to prevent me from telling you how much I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall drop a little the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic, to tell you. how I &s;ped at WAKEFIELD, and introduce to your notice &s;uch characters and incidents as are now ripe for your ob&s;ervation. Among the&s;e let me fir&s;t &s;peak of one of the mo&s;t intelligent, cheerful, plea&s;ant men I have met with. I mean Mr. CLEMENTSHAW, who is by every body admired and re&s;pected, and who&s;e conver&s;ation&mdash;for indeed it is very de&s;ireable&mdash;is every where de|&s;ired. He is the organi&s;t&mdash;was a pupil of Dr. MILLER&mdash;has all the neigh|bouring teaching&mdash;and is in a very comfortable and reputable &s;ituation. His performance on the harp&s;ichord is &s;econd only to BOYTON; nay, when we con&s;ider that this happy, ea&s;y man&mdash;who&s;e face is never without a &s;mile, nor I believe his heart without a benevolent &s;en&s;ation&mdash;is blind&mdash;which I would not declare did I not know his perfect good &s;en&s;e and &s;trong philo&s;ophy&mdash;he may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be con&s;idered as BOYTON's equal. No man's conver|&s;ation is more agreeable, for no man has a more per&s;picuous and decided judgment on all general &s;ubjects. But his great forte is a rational laugh. He &s;hall make you more and better extemporary puns in an hour&mdash;with a view to <HI>laugh at punning</HI>&mdash;than Mr. O'KEEFE would &s;tudiou&s;ly introduce in a whole

O'KEEFE and SHIELDS.

In &s;hort, I know not any man in who&s;e company I have felt more plea&s;ure; no wonder therefore I take &s;o much in repeating it. Mr. SOUTHERN, of WAKEFIELD, who is a fine young man, and much beloved, is al&s;o entitled to my acknow|ledgements; and the Rev. Mr. VINCENT will, I hope, pardon me if I take this opportunity of thanking him with great &s;incerity for the many kind &s;ervices he did me. Nor &s;hall WALLER the printer, that well-mean|ing kind creature, go without my hearty good wi&s;hes, for I am &s;ure I have his.</P>
<P>I had one very good night at WAKEFIELD&mdash;Saturday December 8th&mdash;and after &s;pending the Sunday mo&s;t agreeably with CLEMENTSHAW, went on the Monday to LEEDS. On Tue&s;day I performed to a very decent number, among which were &s;ome of the principal people, who, at the end of the entertainment, begged I would give it again on the Thur&s;day. One gentleman, in particular, took a great deal of pains, procured me the a&s;&s;embly room, was in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of its being well filled, and gave me a hand&s;ome letter to a gentleman at MANCHESTER.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="184">I mu&s;t not pa&s;s by an incident which very &s;trongly proves a po&s;ition&mdash;not a bad one by the bye&mdash;of Mr. ASTLEY, the rider. Says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your SHAKESPEARE there, upon the &s;tage, &s;ays that all the world's a &s;tage.&mdash;Damme, I &s;ays, &s;ays I, all the world's a puppet &s;hew. Why now d'ye &s;ee ben't every body &s;hew-men? Don't the king, good ble&s;s him, &s;hew his lions at the tower?"</Q> But to proceed. There happened to be at LEEDS, at the time I mention, a full grown gentleman, &s;ix and thirty inches high; and about an hour before I began my performance, an amba&s;&s;ador from the <HI>little man</HI> was di&s;patched to negociate with me the terms of an itinerant alliance. I li&s;tened to the propo&s;al with great coolne&s;s, and a&s;ked if it was the wi&s;h of this man in miniature to be produced out of my pocket, or ex|hibited on my finger while I &s;hould &s;ing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ay little fooli&s;h fluttering thing."</Q></P>
<P>At LEEDS I became acquainted with Mr. WARBURTON, an independant profe&s;&s;ional man, who has it amply in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the amu&s;ement of the public, without the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to humiliation. His &s;pirited and &s;en&s;ible conduct in a bu&s;ine&s;s that happened ju&s;t before I came to LEEDS, as above, gives a &s;triking proof of this. I had heard at WAKEFIELD that it would be impolitic to apply to Mr. WARBURTON, for he was <HI>out of favour.</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How out of favour?'</Q> Why he had neglected to attend one of the concerts.&mdash;My an&s;wer was, that I &s;uppo&s;ed he was better engaged. The fact however was this.&mdash;Mr. WARBURTON was cho&s;en by the managers of the concert as commander in chief: for it would have been an affront to his &s;ituation in life to have con&s;idered him in any other light. Notwith&s;tanding this, he was continually thwarted, and though out of pocket by the concert, expected to be at their beck and call upon all occa&s;ions. This he overlooked with the con|tempt it merited&mdash;determined to go on as &s;moothly as he could till the end of the &s;ea&s;on; but being ill&mdash;<HI>they</HI> &s;ay, through having drank too much the day before at a turtle-fea&s;t&mdash;he thought it could be no &s;uch great matter if they were for once to make a trial of &s;pelling out the <HI>concertos</HI> and <HI>&s;onatas</HI> by them|&s;elves. A re&s;olution was immediately formed&mdash;and immediately repented of&mdash;
<PB N="178" REF="185">
to admit Mr. WARBURTON no more: who, on his part, very properly de|termined to have nothing more to do with them. What is the con&s;equence? It never would have given him any plea&s;ure to have his ears tortured with the di&s;&s;onance and fal&s;e time of <HI>gentlemen players,</HI> who, after all, he mu&s;t not dare to command&mdash;for they were in the &s;ituation of <HI>Trinculo</HI> in the <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;hall be king, and I'll be viceroy over you."</Q> He mu&s;t therefore &s;ecretly rejoice at being rid of a trouble, which nothing but his own good nature&mdash;of which no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a larger &s;hare&mdash;ever induced him to give him&s;elf; and they repine at their non&s;en&s;ical folly which has deprived them of the only means by which their concert could &s;tand the &s;malle&s;t chance of flouri&s;hing, or being re&s;pectable. As to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the turtle-fea&s;t, 'tis too illiberal to talk about it; but, admitting it were true, it only proves that Mr. WARBUR|TON cannot &s;tand liquor quite &s;o well as them&s;elves. I have &s;o particularly mentioned this circum&s;tance, that it may &s;erve as a hint to the <HI>diletanti</HI> in the country, who&mdash;and they may take my word for it&mdash;becau&s;e they can <HI>&s;crape</HI> upon the <HI>fiddle</HI> out of tune, <HI>toot</HI> a little upon the <HI>flute,</HI> or <HI>growl</HI> upon the <HI>vio|loncello,</HI> are neither qualified to command &s;uch men as Mr. WARBURTON, nor give the <HI>ton</HI> to the MUSICAL WORLD.</P>
<P>My TOUR has already pretty well &s;hewn that I have as much patience as any public man need; but I declare, were I in the affluent &s;ituation of Mr. WARBURTON, which&mdash;as he truly de&s;erves&mdash;may he long comfortably en|joy! I &s;hould content my&s;elf with the eligible and di&s;tingui&s;hed attention paid me by LORD MEXBOROUGH, SIR GEORGE ARMYTAGE, Mr. FAWKES, &amp;c. and feel very little inclination indeed to be at the devotion of a &s;et of <HI>mechanics</HI> who think them&s;elves of prodigious con&s;equence, by having taken it into their heads to become <HI>gentlemen fidlers.</HI> Among the&s;e, God forbid I &s;hould have the ingratitude to rank any of tho&s;e who attended me.</P>
<P>LEEDS is a town of great trade; &s;o much &s;o, that a gentleman belong|ing to one of the banks a&s;&s;ured me the whole returns of the place could not be

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING in my la&s;t letter but one &s;poken gene|rally of <HI>harmony,</HI> and &s;hewn that it is the mere <HI>wood</HI> and <HI>&s;tone</HI> of MUSIC&mdash;which might as well have lain dormant as a part of the original chaos, if <HI>me|lody</HI> did not lend it order, &s;ymmetry, and proportion. I &s;hall, in this, in|ve&s;tigate it &s;omething more minutely, and &s;hew that what is called harmony is now <HI>refined</HI> into &s;uch a pitch of barbari&s;m&mdash;which, though it may &s;eem a paradox, is literally truth&mdash;that the ear would be better gratified by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t violation of the rules of compo&s;ition, as they are called, than by &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubdivi&s;ions of tones and re&s;olutions of di&s;cords as&mdash;according to <HI>theori&s;ts</HI>&mdash;are the very e&s;&s;ence of <HI>harmony.</HI> Nor am I unable or unwilling to prove what I advance.</P>
<P>Every rule of compo&s;ition, except avoiding con&s;ecutive fifths and octaves, are&mdash;in the hands of men of genius&mdash;to be violated with con&s;iderable advantage; el&s;e, the great HANDEL&mdash;the ma&s;terly CORRELLI&mdash;the charming, natural, ea&s;y ARNE&mdash;the graceful GALUPPI&mdash;and almo&s;t every body of real con&s;equence mu&s;t be excluded from among the adepts. To the&s;e two &s;tanding rules how|ever the bolde&s;t &s;ons of nature have paid &s;ome re&s;pect; and it is true that two
<PB N="181" REF="188">
major fifths &s;hould never be con&s;ecutive. Upon this I ground my argument. Let any man play two &s;en&s;ecutive fifths&mdash;which would be a mu&s;ical &s;acrilege&mdash;and it &s;hall &s;ound more plea&s;ing to an indifferent ear than the introduction of the chord of the thirteenth, ever &s;o well prepared and re&s;olved&mdash;which is a <HI>mu&s;ical excellences.</HI> But who &s;hall an&s;wer when I go further and &s;ay that the very harmoni&s;ts them&s;elves have only to play on a full organ, and they will infallibly add to the charms of their own ingenious modulation, all the&s;e complicate violations of harmony!&mdash;for the <HI>diapa&s;on, principle,</HI> and <HI>&s;e&s;qualtra</HI> compounding the very di&s;tances which mu&s;icians are commanded to avoid, the beauties and faults are blended together, and how mu&s;t the under&s;tanding be &s;hocked by the admi&s;&s;ion of error into a &s;y&s;tem of perfection! How then &s;hall this be reconciled? The organ is a noble in&s;trument. Some <HI>poet</HI> &s;ays it is calculated to in&s;pire holy love. The <HI>mu&s;ician,</HI> therefore, cannot lay the fault on the <HI>in&s;trument,</HI> as the <HI>devil</HI> did upon the <HI>water</HI> becau&s;e he could not &s;wim. This will be found to be the fact: Let a &s;imple, unadorned melody be accompanied only by &s;uch modulations as ari&s;e from the general and per|fect nature of the &s;ubject, and&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the violation of the rules in con&s;equence of the complicate con&s;truction of the in&s;trument&mdash;my life for it the right effect upon the pa&s;&s;ions will be produced; without which <HI>harmony</HI> is no longer <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> and con&s;equently no longer <HI>mu&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P>One &s;hould think the&s;e dogmatic mu&s;icians knew their own defects and encouraged them&mdash;like callous hearted lawyers, who dare not indulge the &s;ofter feelings le&s;t they &s;hould incline them to pity and compa&s;&s;ion. I am told there is a certain great harmoni&s;t who wears the <HI>hind</HI> part of his &s;hirt <HI>before,</HI> by way of armour again&s;t CUPID&mdash;fearing le&s;t any thing <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> &s;hould get into any of his compo&s;itions; and as to Mr. BAUMGARTEN, who is at this moment &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t <HI>theori&s;t</HI> in the kingdom, he has &s;o wonder|fully <HI>improved</HI> upon fuguing, that he never <HI>leads</HI> the band at <HI>Covent Garden</HI>

Thus, in time, we may have lively hopes&mdash;when the bagpipe &s;hall have done &s;queaking&mdash;that theatrical mu&s;ic, like theatrical government, &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed by its di&s;cords; that a knowledge of thorough ba&s;s &s;hall be the indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ite in a comic &s;inger; that clowns and chambermaids will &s;putter out their non&s;en&s;e in fugues, and dying lovers warble their di&s;tre&s;s in counterpoint.</NOTE> Indeed, were I to enumerate all the tricks of the&s;e profound theori&s;ts, it would take up a larger portion of time and pains than I am willing to allow &s;o unprofitable a &s;ubject.

If this country had produced nine HOOKS, and they had divided among them the manu&s;cript of HAYDN's compo&s;itions&mdash;or, indeed, were to work upon them now they are publi&s;hed, which is ju&s;t as fair play as times go&mdash;there would be materials enough to furni&s;h each a mu&s;ical reputation:&mdash;and yet, is there a fair, well-wrought-up movement in his whole works? Do they con&s;i&s;t of any thing more than &s;trong effu&s;ions of genius turned into frenzy, and labouring as ineffectually to be heard as a flute in a belfry, or equity in a court of ju&s;tice?

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY account of places, manners, &amp;c. is of a long &s;tanding&mdash;therefore I may as well give you time to dige&s;t my arguments con|cerning mu&s;ic, and clear my ground as far as I have gone&mdash;as gardeners dig in the old cabbage &s;talks to make the &s;urface of the bed the fairer on which they are preparing to plant a new crop. Indeed I have generally &s;poken of every place, but I would willingly leave nothing undone. To &s;et about this completely, I believe I mu&s;t go back as far as BIRMIGNHAM, the ingenuity and populou&s;ne&s;s of which place are wonderful. The increa&s;e of buildings, both for convenience and plea&s;ure, has extended the place to a &s;pace at lea&s;t as large again as when I knew it twenty-five years ago. The fir&s;t, however, is as prai&s;e worthy as the la&s;t is ridiculous. Not that I would not have men enjoy the money they have earned&mdash;let it be procured through whatever me|dium it hone&s;tly may&mdash;but the country hou&s;es of the BIRMINGHAMITES are embelli&s;hed to as little purpo&s;e as a chimney-&s;weeper wa&s;hes his face, and as awkwardly as a Guinea-pig imitates a &s;quirrel. As to their manners, I am &s;ure they are not <HI>good</HI> ones. A tenacious man mu&s;t infallibly, in BIR|MINGHAM, be affronted ten times a day:&mdash;for even if you go to <HI>buy</HI> any thing, it is fifty to one if you receive a civil an&s;wer:&mdash;and this rudene&s;s ex|tends
<PB N="185" REF="192">
to the mo&s;t opulent among them. A man who is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s two hundred thou&s;and pounds u&s;ed me with a &s;tyle of incivility that would have di&s;graced a porter in Thames-&s;treet; and I called upon another man of the fir&s;t con&s;equence there, whom I could not &s;ingle out from the journeymen black&s;miths that &s;urrounded him. Indeed ma&s;ter and &s;ervant is confounded among them, for each leads the &s;ame life, works as hard, drinks as much fat ale, and undergoes as much drudgery as the other; nor do I &s;ee that one has more felicity in counting u&s;ele&s;s guineas, than the other in carding buttons. I really &s;peak here without acrimony, and it may be &s;een by this: I had no better &s;ucce&s;s at WOLVERHAMPTON than at BIRMINGHAM, and yet there I found civility not incompatible with trade.</P>
<P>I have been trying what to &s;ay more of LICHFIELD, but can find no|thing&mdash;unle&s;s I were to go over the old ground of the ma&s;&s;acre of DIOCLE|SIAN&mdash;in which a thou&s;and chri&s;tians were martyred, and their bodies ex|po&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts. For this cruel event it &s;eems to have mourned ever &s;ince; for it is &s;o melancholy, that one would wonder Mi&s;s SEWARD could write ver&s;es that have &s;o many charms for the reviewers, in a place appa|rently calculated to engender only the vapours; but, indeed, tho&s;e gentle|men in general &s;eem to have a peculiar knack of &s;peaking <HI>eloquently</HI> upon <HI>dull &s;ubjects.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to the antiquity of DERBY, but only mention it as a clean, pretty-looking, genteel town, where I &s;incerely believe the in|habitants want neither &s;pirit nor ta&s;te. As to what happened to me, it was one of tho&s;e &s;trokes&mdash;a <HI>traver&s;e</HI>&mdash;that have attended me all my life, and which, like the mi&s;take of a figure in the &s;olution of a mathematical prob|lem, in proportion as you expect to come home to your point, carries you out of your way.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193">NOTTINGHAM, as I have before &s;aid, has &s;omething charming in its &s;ituation; the ca&s;tle has a beautifully romantic effect, and the <HI>Trent</HI> breaks the country near it in a mo&s;t delightful and picture&s;que manner. Indeed I know not, at times, whether the mind does not as &s;trongly pant for objects that derive their grandeur from &s;implicity, as for tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing natural effects which as it were pain and giddy the &s;en&s;es, till &s;ober reality is lo&s;t in intoxicated imagination.</P>
<P>NEWARK is &s;omething in the &s;tyle of DERBY. I do not think the in|habitants are &s;o rich, but they do not want &s;pirit. NEWARK is a very de&s;irable place for per&s;ons of &s;mall fortune to &s;ettle at. Hou&s;e rent is rea&s;on|able; and the corporation being, for the &s;ize of the place, rich&mdash;paving, high|ways, public building, and repairs, maintaining the poor, and many other nece&s;&s;ary but heavy charges are defrayed without a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the inhabitants; and yet, they are better paid than in any other town of its &s;tanding that I have &s;een. The <HI>town-hall</HI> and the <HI>poor-hou&s;e</HI> are, in <HI>proportion,</HI> I believe I may venture to &s;ay the be&s;t in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>If it be true that LINCOLN formerly contained fifty two pari&s;h churches and one thou&s;and and &s;eventy one hou&s;es of entertainment, it is certainly very much fallen into decay. The &s;ituation from the hill is wonderful, and the clergy, who are a&s;toni&s;hingly numerous there, &s;eem to have got on as high a <HI>pinnacle</HI> as they can, with a view, I hope, to evince how idle to them are all the vain pomp and glory of this world. I am not honoured with the know|ledge of the&s;e gentlemen, nor had I the lea&s;t conver&s;ation with any except Dr. KAYE, who, though a certain new&s;paper is extremely angry that he &s;hould be prai&s;ed at the expence of the re&s;t of the clergy, has in the opinion of many others, as well as my&s;elf, &s;et an example in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>tithe child,</HI> that we &s;hall &s;tand very little chance of &s;eeing imitated. The manners of LINCOLN &s;eem to be a con&s;tant internal enmity, and a remark|able &s;hyne&s;s to &s;trangers. Their mu&s;ical ta&s;te I have given an in&s;tance of.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="194">HULL, originally a &s;mall fi&s;hing village, is now a very con&s;iderable &s;ea port; and, lying between YARMOUTH and NEWCASTLE, is remarkably con|venient either for homeward or outward bound &s;hips. The increa&s;e of their commerce is apparent in the new dock already made, and that lately applied for to parliament. Round the dock is formed a kind of cre&s;cent, con&s;i&s;ting of magnificent hou&s;es, which form an appearance of extraordinary novelty, by being the boundary of one of the dirtie&s;t places in the kingdom. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the dock is a row of warehou&s;es, to a prodigious extent, very &s;pacious, and admirably well &s;tored. As to their ta&s;te, I do not think they reli&s;hed much of my entertainment, except <HI>Grog</HI>; and for their manners&mdash;being all &s;eamen&mdash;they are blunt, hone&s;t, and carele&s;s. I mu&s;t not forget to mention the kind attention of Mr. MARLEY, whom I &s;hould have been happy to have know better, that I might have &s;poken of his profe&s;&s;ional merit with the &s;ame certainty as that of BOYTON and CLEMENTSHAW. It is univer&s;ally allowed to be very brilliant, and I am &s;ure, if it bear any proportion to his kind and obliging private conduct, his friends&mdash;who are a very large num|ber&mdash;cannot &s;peak too highly of it. Nor will I neglect to record the kind|ne&s;s of poor HUDSON&mdash;how no more&mdash;who died like the wife of BONIFACE&mdash;but in this life we have need of CORDIALS&mdash;&s;o peace to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poor HUDSON puts me in mind of a brother-in-law of GRIFFIN, the book&s;eller, who was kill|ing him&s;elf by drinking.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THEORY in mu&s;ic, and the empty non&s;en&s;e of its profe&s;&s;ors being the &s;ubject of my la&s;t letter&mdash;in which I think I have plainly &s;hewn that a &s;ingle air, with &s;implicity for its object and expre&s;&s;ion for its effect, is infinitely preferable to the mo&s;t laboured production that can be worked up mechanically&mdash;I &s;hall proceed to remark on the pernicious effects of following a doctrine &s;o very fal&s;e and delu&s;ive, and point out that it has &s;tep by &s;tep perverted and vitiated the Engli&s;h ta&s;te. Fir&s;t of all, <HI>theori&s;ts</HI> content them&s;elves&mdash;indeed they want invention to do otherwi&s;e&mdash;with very indifferent, and in general <HI>trite</HI> melodies. Thus, having acquired great repu|tation by the pomp annexed to their being profe&s;&s;ed mu&s;icians, their mu&s;ic is li&s;tened to, and at length liked, upon the principle of a man's eating bi&s;cuit at &s;ea becau&s;e he can get no bread. The human mind is &s;o prone to the re|ception of plea&s;ure, that it very often takes it upon credit, and is &s;windled into a belief of the reality of what upon examination turns out to be only counterfeit. Thus the manly, and I will venture to &s;ay correct ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h, which admired the works of PURCELL, ARNE, and BOYCE&mdash;and &s;urely they have among them &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t melodies that ever &s;poke
<PB N="189" REF="196">
to the heart&mdash;is now dwindled into an admiration of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ipidity. It &s;hould &s;eem as if mu&s;ic had expired with the &s;ingers who uttered it, and that LEVERIDGE and BEARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mean to &s;ay BEARD is literally no more&mdash;I am informed he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, at this moment, all his faculties in full vigour: may he long do &s;o. I was very young when Mr. BEARD knew me, and he mu&s;t remember, through the er&s;ua&s;ion of others, he treated me very unhand&s;omely; but I acquit him of all intention to do &s;o, and take this public opportunity of a&s;&s;uring him that I never had of any man a higher opinion, nor for any a greater value.</NOTE> having given way to the u&s;e of effeminacy and falcetto, the &s;tyle &s;hould &s;ink in proportion: otherwi&s;e, how can it be ac|counted for that the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hark forwards"</Q> of the pre&s;ent day &s;hould be ten times more in circulation than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With horns and with hounds,"</Q> or <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The early horn?"</Q> Has not a &s;ingle in&s;ipid &s;ong, called the <HI>Man&s;ion of peace,</HI> brought &s;ix times the profit to the compo&s;er that the whole <HI>Chaplet</HI> did to BOYCE?&mdash;though to mention the comparative merits would be like talking of a Scotch bank note and the riches of the trea&s;ury. Nothing in nature can be more beautifully delicious than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vain is every fond endeavour"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What med'cine can &s;often the bo&s;om's keen &s;mart?"</Q>.

But to enumerate other in&s;tances. Is it not true that, at this moment, were the beauties of ARNE collected together, headed by all the melody, &s;weetne&s;s, &s;pirit, character, and expre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Comus</HI>; the charming, peculiarly natural airs to which he &s;o enchantingly &s;et the Songs of SHAKESPEAR&mdash;which ta&s;k I will venture to &s;ay no man in the world could have executed equal to ARNE&mdash;and made up of tho&s;e innumerable charms which pervade his volu|minous works, would they not be all neglected for that mi&s;erable, unmeaning imitation of <HI>La virginella,</HI> and twenty other things&mdash;called <HI>Ma cher ami?</HI> And to give yet a &s;tronger proof: Were all PURCELL's duettos brought forth&mdash;who had, beyond all que&s;tion, a more vigorous mind than HANDEL&mdash;were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let CESAR and URANIA live"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To arms"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I &s;aw fair CLORA"</Q>&mdash;and in &s;hort all tho&s;e admirable compo&s;itions which &s;o honourably mark the

&s;trength of Engli&s;h genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORELLI is &s;aid to have vi&s;ited ENGLAND on purpo&s;e to &s;ee PURCELL, but hearing, at ROCHES|TER, of his death, he did not even vi&s;it the CAPITAL, but returned, &s;aying&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There can be nothing worthy my curio&s;ity &s;ince PURCELL is dead."</Q></NOTE>&mdash;would they not be de&s;pi&s;ed for that mo&s;t execra|ble of all apologies for MUSIC, the <HI>Duetto</HI> &s;ung by Mr. KELLY and Mrs. CROUCH?</P>
<P>I beg I may not be under&s;tood to mean, by what I have here advanced, that the compilers of &s;uch contemptible &s;tuff are the <HI>theori&s;ts</HI> of whom I have &s;poken above. The&s;e are only the dabblers, who take advantage of the bad ta&s;te of the times. But to come more clo&s;ely to the point, and &s;atisfy every enquirer what are the &s;teps which have cau&s;ed this gradual declen&s;ion in the public ta&s;te? I an&s;wer, in great mea&s;ure, a blind predilection for the works of HANDEL, and an indi&s;criminate avidity for German compo&s;itions. What! &s;hall any man dare to make &s;o bold a declaration? I do&mdash;but let me have fair play. HANDEL was a compo&s;er of wonderful abilities; his conception was &s;trong, his imagination immen&s;e, his knowledge of mu&s;ic, as a &s;cience, clear and profound&mdash;and tho&s;e ma&s;terly combinations of &s;ounds which make up many of his choru&s;&s;es abundantly prove it; but, like hounds led on by the hunt&s;man on a fal&s;e &s;cent, he is admired in ENGLAND for his very errors.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">HANDEL has been frequently compared to SHAKESPEARE, though nothing can be upon more oppo&s;ite grounds than the admiration which has been re&s;pectively paid them. SHAKESPEARE has been always prai&s;ed for his genius, and HANDEL for his judgment. He who wi&s;hed &s;o much of the writings of SHAKESPEARE obliterated, would, I fancy, have been at a lo&s;s where to have laid his finger: whereas, it were very ea&s;y to point out which half of HANDEL's works might be con&s;igned to oblivion, and yet leave all that is plea&s;ing in his compo&s;itions behind.</NOTE> When I &s;ay errors I do not &s;peak as to his knowledge as a mu&s;ician, but to his ta&s;te as a man of genius. The&s;e errors in HANDEL relate to ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which was &s;ometimes fal&s;e, like tin&s;el in poetry; &s;ometimes ridi|culous, like bomba&s;t; often begun upon a principle which &s;unk in the end to
<PB N="191" REF="198">
ab&s;urdity&mdash;making exactly the bathos; and very frequently indeed &s;ound without either meaning or expre&s;&s;ion, an&s;wering exactly to non&s;en&s;e ver&s;es.</P>
<P>I believe it will be allowed me that the parts of any thing which offers it&s;elf to human ob&s;ervation are complete only as they regard the whole. In mu&s;ic no man ever did or will greatly &s;ucceed who takes up <HI>particular</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>general</HI> expre&s;&s;ion. HANDEL was a &s;lave to this&mdash;but to adduce my proofs.</P>
<P>His fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ion was this: If the &s;ubject happened to be joy, he toO frequently invetend &s;omething <HI>&s;prightly</HI>&mdash;without con&s;idering <HI>time, place,</HI> or <HI>occa&s;ion</HI>; as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Rejoice oh daughter of SION"</Q>&mdash;which &s;urely &s;hould convey a holy joy, expre&s;&s;ive of religious, &s;oul-felt rapture; in&s;tead of which, this &s;ong was fir&s;t a <HI>jig,</HI> and afterwards a <HI>hornpipe.</HI> Another in&s;tance occurs in <HI>Judas Maccabeus</HI>&mdash;in the &s;ong <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let honour with de&s;ert be crown'd".</Q> The word trumpet here happening to be introduced, he has taken &s;uch an <HI>advan|tage</HI> of it that the whole &s;ong &s;eems as if it was &s;et to di&s;play the effect of the trumpet, in a key which does not belong to it, and where of cour&s;e it has the <HI>wor&s;t effect</HI> that can be imagined; and as if this was not enough, the words &s;eem to be written as a burle&s;que on the mu&s;ic; for they run thus&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The trumpet ne'er in vain &s;hould &s;ound."</Q> I have heard this &s;ong prai&s;ed as the be&s;t in all his works.</P>
<P>The &s;econd in&s;tance which I call ridiculous, or bomba&s;t, is a wor&s;e fault than the other&mdash;and yet it occurs as frequently. Who can li&s;ten to &s;uch a pantomime tune as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The land brought forth frogs,"</Q> and call it any thing but burle&s;que?&mdash;and yet this is a popular favourite. I heard a man in the gallery &s;ay, while the chorus was performing which begins <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And he &s;pake the word, and there came all manner of flies and lice in all their quarters"</Q>&mdash;that he itched from head to foot. Would the gentleman have been obliged to HANDEL for giving him this &s;en&s;ation if he had lived in the days of JAMES I. who is &s;aid to have prohibited &s;cratching? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THAIS led the way"</Q>
<PB N="192" REF="199">
and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The king &s;eized a flambeau"</Q> are again of this complexion&mdash;for they both convey a kind of drunken gaiety, and give you more the idea of their going up &s;tairs to bed together than to &s;et the Per&s;epolis on fire.</P>
<P>As to the bathos, it occurs in &s;uch in&s;tances as the chorus in the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All we like &s;heep are gone a&s;tray"</Q>&mdash;which profanes the words it &s;hould expre&s;s, and might with great propriety be put into the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Peep behind the curtain"</Q>&mdash;where the &s;tory of ORPHEUS is burle&s;qued.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEVERLEY is &s;aid to be one of the prettie&s;t towns in ENGLAND. To this I cannot wholly agree. It is a &s;nug decent town; has a &s;pacious market place; and its min&s;ter&mdash;which is very ancient, and was formerly a &s;anctuary to bankrupts and criminals&mdash;is yet a very hand|&s;ome church; but I think it inferior to many towns in York&s;hire as to beauty, con&s;equence, or &s;ituation. The inhabitants, however, appear to be independent; and, by mixing &s;ocially together, promote very plea&s;antly all that is nece&s;&s;ary or agreeable towards forming a friendly and comfortable neighbourhood. This town has many advantageous privileges, among which is their being exempt from toll and cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>I know not what to &s;ay of YORK, except that it fell infinitely below my expectations in every point of view. I expected to &s;ee a large, oppu|lent, populous place&mdash;&s;econd to nothing in ENGLAND but LONDON&mdash;in&s;tead of which, except the <HI>church</HI> and the <HI>gaol,</HI> there is no one object that con|veys an idea of &s;uperiority to the other towns around it. It is not near &s;o populous as LEEDS, nor half &s;o much frequented. Talking to a gentle|man at LEEDS, I told him YORK put me in mind of a man in conver&s;ation,
<PB N="194" REF="201">
who, though rich in volubility, fini&s;hed as he began&mdash;having impre&s;&s;ed no one with either truth or rea&s;on in his argument; whereas LEEDS put in only a word now and then, but always to the purpo&s;e. YORK is, <HI>in proportion,</HI> the poore&s;t place in the whole county of which it is the capital. Its &s;ituation being in the very center of all the great north roads, which are now very fine, and a&s;toni&s;hingly frequented, it is continually <HI>bu&s;y,</HI> without having <HI>any thing to do</HI>; and though con&s;tantly <HI>crammed,</HI> thinly <HI>inhabited.</HI> The inns alone &s;eem to thrive there. In &s;hort, it has many churches and but little <HI>devotion; fine clothes</HI> and <HI>&s;pare pur&s;es</HI>; a <HI>magnificent pri&s;on</HI> always <HI>full</HI>; and a <HI>theatre royal</HI> where they perform <HI>at a con&s;tant lo&s;s.</HI> As a proof of their mu&s;ical ta&s;te, they think Mr. KELLY and Mrs. CROUCH's <HI>duetto</HI> comprizes all the excellence of all the ma&s;ters that ever bowed at the &s;hrine of APOLLO. It mu&s;t be re|membered I have one exception to the&s;e general rules&mdash;and I believe when I &s;ay I have <HI>but one,</HI> I write as &s;trong a &s;atire as words are capable of conveying.</P>
<P>MALTON is a &s;habby town apparently in every re&s;pect&mdash;I will therefore leave it, and go on to SCARBOROUGH, which is one of the prettie&s;t &s;eaports I have &s;een. Every body knows it is maintained upon the principle of BATH. One thing, however, &s;urprized me; though I was cautioned again&s;t the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of their charges, I found them &s;o much the rever&s;e, that I paid le&s;s for better things than at any place on that &s;ide the HUMBER.</P>
<P>WAKEFIELD I confe&s;s is one of my favourite places. There is &s;uch a &s;prightly cleanline&s;s about it, that the inhabitants &s;eem as if they were born for the real purpo&s;es of life. The village of HEATH, near it, is one of the &s;weete&s;t &s;pots for neatne&s;s and &s;implicity that imagination can form. The vicinity of WAKEFIELD is filled with opulent and re&s;pectable inhabitants, all of whom inherit or have accumulated fortunes by trade. Their manners appear to be &s;imple and unaffected; their conver&s;ation is poli&s;hed, and in their mu&s;ical pur&s;uits they go my way to work, and prai&s;e every thing that plea&s;es them upon reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="202">DONCASTER has all the neatne&s;s of a quaker, and on a fir&s;t view be|gets very &s;trongly your &s;ober admiration; but when you come to con&s;ider that they have no &s;oul, no ta&s;te, no characteri&s;tic but in&s;ipidity&mdash;after having admired the <HI>church,</HI> the <HI>man&s;ion hou&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>guildhall</HI>&mdash;you wi&s;h your&s;elf any where but at DONCASTER.</P>
<P>As to the roads to all tho&s;e different places, there are now no bad ones but what are nece&s;&s;arily &s;o through &s;ituation and &s;oil, and near manufacturing towns, where time can be more valuably employed than in mending roads&mdash;though one would think that work would contribute to their convenience, &s;ince the goods mu&s;t be <HI>carried</HI> after they are <HI>made.</HI> Thus, almo&s;t every where in <HI>&s;wampy</HI> LINCOLNSHIRE the roads are generally very di&s;agreeable, e&s;|pecially in winter; and great part of DERBYSHIRE, on account of the hills, render your journeys unplea&s;ant, and not always very &s;afe. I mu&s;t not for|get, in particular, to mention that the nine miles from WAKEFIELD to LEEDS is &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly neglected, that even in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and in the middle of the day, you expect every moment to be overturned.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of all tho&s;e places to which I &s;hall not find it nece&s;|&s;ary to return, except perhaps for &s;ome general ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall go on from LEEDS to HALIFAX, where I was advi&s;ed to perform a night or two previous to my touching at MANCHESTER. When I came there, however, they had a company of players, and were otherwi&s;e &s;o full of amu&s;ements, that after &s;itting down a few days, and writing a part of this TOUR, I went on to MANCHESTER&mdash;promi&s;ing, if I could make it convenient, to call on my return.</P>
<P>On my arrival at MANCHESTER, I not only found that the theatre was open, but that Mr. ASTLEY was figuring away in great &s;tyle with his <HI>hor&s;e|man&s;hip,</HI> to which amu&s;ement I have the &s;ame aver&s;ion&mdash;and perhaps for better rea&s;ons&mdash;that &s;ome men have to a CAT. I therefore enclo&s;ed a letter
<PB N="196" REF="203">
I had brought with me to an opulent gentleman&mdash;informed him I would take another opportunity to pay him my per&s;onal re&s;pects&mdash;and po&s;ted away to LIVERPOOL.</P>
<P>As my &s;ucce&s;s at this place, and the &s;ubjects on which it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily induce me to &s;peak, will make a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and intere&s;ting part of this work, I &s;hall introduce them as con&s;picuou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible in the following letter but one; and, in the interim, &s;upply the next with the remainder of my argument re&s;pecting HANDEL and German mu&s;ic, which ideas I threw loo&s;ely on paper at HALIFAX, which is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t mu&s;ical &s;pot for its &s;ize in the kingdom:&mdash;for there Mrs. BATES received her mu&s;ical education&mdash;there Mr. BATES has &s;o planted a veneration for the works of HANDEL, that chil|dren li&s;p <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For unto us a child is born,"</Q> and cloth-makers, as they &s;weat under their loads in the cloth-hall, roar out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For his yoke is ea&s;y and his burden is light."</Q> I have been a&s;&s;ured, for a fact, that more than one man in HALIFAX can take any part in the choru&s;&s;es of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and go regu|larly through the whole oratorio by heart; and, indeed, the facility with which the common people join together throughout the greate&s;t part of YORK|SHIRE and LANCASHIRE, in every &s;pecies of choral mu&s;ic, is truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE in&s;tances of HANDEL's total neglect of ex|pre&s;&s;ion occur much more frequently than any of his other faults. How many of his oratorio &s;ongs con&s;i&s;t of a complex accompaniment&mdash;ingeniou&s;ly worked up indeed, but without the &s;malle&s;t relation to the &s;ubject of the words&mdash;while the voice drawls out an unmeaning train of &s;ounds, de&s;titute of melody, or any power of conveying a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation. Sometimes in the&s;e &s;ongs, that the voice may have no rea&s;on to complain of having le&s;s to do than the in&s;tru|ments&mdash;for in this &s;pecies of mu&s;ic every thing is upon a footing&mdash;it floats away upon a long divi&s;ion, and often &s;uch a one as no voice upon earth can execute. This is &s;urely the very rever&s;e of what <HI>vocal mu&s;ic</HI> ought to be, where every thing manife&s;tly &s;hould be &s;ubordinate to the <HI>voice</HI>; and, even in a hautboy &s;ong, or any other where a particular in&s;trument may have an <HI>obligato</HI> accompaniment, the voice ought to be every where <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted,</HI> but no where <HI>eclip&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Vocal MUSIC is clearly the e&s;&s;ence of whatever can render &s;ound delec|table; that which is &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive is the be&s;t vocal MUSIC; and, I will add, that a &s;ong perfect in all its qualities is the utmo&s;t height of
<PB N="198" REF="205">
excellence to which MUSIC can arrive. This po&s;ition I &s;hall hereafter more fully go into, as I mean to leave what I advance on this &s;ubject unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>In &s;olo &s;ongs&mdash;where one point of expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be ob&s;erved, where a &s;ingle, unembarra&s;&s;ed &s;ubject &s;hould be well <HI>begun, followed,</HI> and <HI>fini&s;hed</HI>&mdash;HANDEL very often falls below mediocrity. This proves that he is a better <HI>in&s;trumental</HI> than a <HI>vocal</HI> compo&s;er; for in the major part of his choru&s;&s;es where the expre&s;&s;ion need not &s;o much depend on the voice&mdash;for there it acts only as a kind of in&s;trument to fill the parts&mdash;he is much more happy; and in his other works, where the voice has no &s;hare at all, he is incom|parably greater than any where. Who can deny this when they recollect the minuet in Ariadne? There is not a &s;uperfluous note in it, and being made up of one &s;imple, and yet grand, object&mdash;regularly pur&s;ued, and greatly worked up&mdash;nothing in MUSIC, for what it is, can exceed it. To which if you call in the other minuets, together with the marches and gavottes which make up the la&s;t movements of his overtures, the balance will be con&s;ider|ably in favour of my argument. And yet, while we whi&s;tle all the&s;e with the greate&s;t facility, without con&s;idering to whom we owe this &s;atisfaction, we get crowded at the abbey&mdash;to the tune of <HI>two guineas</HI>&mdash;to be <HI>&s;tunned</HI> with the <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e&s;t</HI> of his works, which, if the heart has any thing to do with MUSIC, is the <HI>wor&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To prove this, let me a&s;k any man in his &s;en&s;es, not a mere <HI>theori&s;t,</HI> if he ever felt &s;o much real plea&s;ure in hearing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The hor&s;e and his rider,"</Q> as in the la&s;t movement of his famous coronation anthem of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God &s;ave the king?"</Q> where there is &s;carcely a di&s;cord that might not be admitted, without wounding &s;implicity, into the mo&s;t familiar &s;ong. After a tedious and tire&s;ome reiteration of di&s;cords, placed unnece&s;&s;arily in every point of view, how are we charmed in the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth!"</Q> Why? Becau&s;e it is full of grandeur and &s;implicity. The &s;oul is &s;truck with the &s;ublime greatne&s;s and beauty of the expre&s;&s;ion, and we feel the DEITY <HI>in our hearts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="206">Thus I think I have proved my po&s;ition without injuring the reputa|tion of HANDEL. He his certainly left behind him &s;ome wonderful MUSIC, but it cannot be denied that this <HI>ore</HI> is plentifully &s;urrounded with <HI>dro&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Let us therefore&mdash;which would be infinitely more to his honour&mdash;take his MUSIC upon credit of our own feelings, and not blindly and implicitly from tho&s;e who, living in a labyrinth, wonder how any one &s;hould prefer a direct road.</P>
<P>As to the other <HI>Germans</HI>&mdash;as they have no <HI>opera,</HI> &s;o they import no vocal MUSIC; and thus by torturing &s;ounds into new po&s;itions, to make old ideas wear a novel &s;hape, <HI>difficulty</HI> is the only characteri&s;tic of their compo&s;i|tions; and by this means the ear gets accu&s;tomed <HI>not</HI> to what <HI>plea&s;es</HI> in MUSIC, but to what <HI>&s;urprizes.</HI> I will venture to &s;ay <HI>&s;olos</HI> and <HI>&s;olo concertos</HI> have done but little good to the cau&s;e of MUSIC. LA MOTTE's great merit was to figure away in <HI>alt,</HI> till at la&s;t, approaching to the bridge, he played him&s;elf, as it were, out of &s;ight. The <HI>dexterity</HI> was <HI>wonderful,</HI> but for heaven's &s;ake where was the <HI>plea&s;ure?</HI> This is a &s;olid fact&mdash;and to prove it, let me a&s;k how came GIARDINI and BARTHELEMON con&s;tantly to call in <HI>Lango Lee, The Dargle,</HI> &amp;c. to help out their concertos.</P>
<P>The human mind cannot pay proper attention but to one object at a time. ZOFFANI's admirable portrait of the gallery of FLORENCE&mdash;at which one might look a month and not di&s;cover half the beauties&mdash;though it con|tains more grand objects than any twenty pictures that ever were painted, has the meane&s;t <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> that can be imagined. It is a chaos of exqui&s;itely charming objects, which cannot be properly di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e one con|founds the effect of the other. There is a &s;oberne&s;s in real plea&s;ure that can|not bear the impertinence of tickling and teazing. In architecture it is the &s;ame. Mr. WOODFALL may remember, as he and I were near each other in HENRY <HI>the &s;eventh's</HI> chapel, to &s;ee the ceremony of in&s;talling the knights of the Bath, he took notice of the wonderful <HI>labour</HI> that had been be&s;towed
<PB N="200" REF="207">
in ornamenting that place; that there was &s;uch a variety, and the parts were &s;o minute, that the eye was at a lo&s;s where to fix. I &s;aid if this was the ca&s;e, he mu&s;t confe&s;s it was <HI>labour in vain:</HI>&mdash;and the ob&s;ervation holds good in every thing that appeals to the &s;en&s;es. And, as to MUSIC, if a man in|vent a tolerable melody, and prevent its effect by complex accompaniment, he will have no better &s;ucce&s;s than the Iri&s;h painter who, undertaking the portrait of a gentleman going a &s;hooting, hid the figure behind a large tree, for fear he &s;hould frighten the partridges.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand there has been already much curio&s;ity concerning what I can po&s;&s;ibly mean in my propo&s;al by an expo&s;ition of <HI>mu&s;ical quackery</HI>&mdash;by the time the crotchet-mongers &s;hall have read this letter they may perhaps &s;mell out what I am diving at. I have yet, however, &s;poken only of impo&s;itions on the &s;en&s;es; I mean hereafter to mention, under the article of teaching, &s;omething concerning de&s;igns on the pocket. I &s;hall fir&s;t, however, place the different merits of dead compo&s;ers &s;ide by &s;ide, in which ta&s;k I have no doubt but I &s;hall prove to the &s;atisfaction of every rea&s;onable man that had not ARNE all his life been di&s;couraged, and HANDEL con&s;idered as another APOLLO, the fame of the ENGLISHMAN would have exceeded that of the GERMAN. This will nearly involve all that it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay&mdash;and, without mentioning a &s;ingle name, throw the merit, or the want of it, if you will, of many living compo&s;ers into that point of view in which it is but common ju&s;tice to have it &s;een. Then, as the bu&s;ine&s;s of teaching is a &s;erious evil, I &s;hall lay it open as bare as po&s;&s;ible, and give a receipt to heal the wound; after which, if the public chu&s;e to be gulled with it, no teach|ing tickets ought to pa&s;s between ma&s;ters and &s;cholars without a &s;tamp, that thus <HI>mu&s;ical quacks</HI> may be at once upon the footing of <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> ones. Strange, &s;ays SWIFT, &s;o much difference &s;hould be 'twixt tweedledum and tweedledee. The world is more impo&s;ed on by trifles than is generally imagined.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO LIVERPOOL I went, without the &s;malle&s;t re|commendation, except indeed a letter to Mr. PYE, who keeps a mu&s;ic ware|hou&s;e there, and to who&s;e attention and indefatigable pains to oblige and ac|commodate me, I confe&s;s my&s;elf greatly indebted. The difficulty I had to get at the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and the doubtful reception I at fir&s;t met with, had at one mo|ment nearly worked me up to a re&s;olution of returning from thence as I went. On my fir&s;t performance, however, which was attended by about thirty-five people, and greatly reli&s;hed, &s;everal gentlemen made &s;trenuous application to me to repeat it, and propo&s;ed a better room for the purpo&s;e. The next evening I had a very hand&s;ome audience, on the third a better &s;till, and on the fourth&mdash;though it was chri&s;tmas eve, and a concert night&mdash;I had the very be&s;t room I have experienced, at any place, &s;ince I fir&s;t began my rambles. Having done very hand&s;omely at LIVERPOOL in relation to my entertain|ment, and mu&s;tered &s;o many more names to my &s;ub&s;cription than at any other place except LONDON, it may be &s;u&s;pected, by the uncandid, that I am induced on this account alone to &s;peak well of that truly &s;pirited place. Tho&s;e, however, who think liberally, and who, by the way, are of the only de&s;cription I care three-pence about obliging, will &s;ee&mdash;as I have every where
<PB N="202" REF="209">
been ju&s;t&mdash;that I give to LIVERPOOL, as I do to BIRMINGHAM only its due.</P>
<P>Throughout life it holds good, as an infallible maxim, that the mind will be influenced by its employment. <HI>Able financiers</HI> have &s;eldom, in any country, been <HI>great mini&s;ters</HI>; becau&s;e their mea&s;ures have been con&s;tantly clogged by the cold regularity of mere calculation. Retired trade&s;men live &s;till in the mi&s;ery of fearing to &s;pend a &s;uperfluous penny; but merchants, though expert at every qualification for the accumulation of profit, are in their minds, like their traffic, exten&s;ive and expanded. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to witne&s;s the difference between a <HI>counting hou&s;e</HI> and a <HI>counter.</HI> For my part, I look upon merchants to be the fir&s;t of characters, and an Engli&s;h one to be the fir&s;t of merchants. VOLTAIRE having drawn a paralleled view of different di&s;tinctions among men, after mentioning the good &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h, in intermarrying their nobility with commercial characters, goes on, and &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After all, it were worth while to con&s;ider which is the more truly noble, he who knows to a moment when the king ri&s;es, or goes to &s;leep, or&mdash;&s;omething el&s;e&mdash;or he who trades to every part of the globe, thereby con|tributing to the comfort and convenience of human nature."</Q></P>
<P>Nothing &s;hews an object &s;o well as a contra&s;t; therefore, as I am not yet come to MANCHESTER and NEWCASTLE, where at one place they mea|&s;ure <HI>&s;erret</HI> by the <HI>yard,</HI> and at the other <HI>coals</HI> by the <HI>bu&s;hel,</HI> I cannot to my &s;atisfaction dwell on LIVERPOOL. On my return to that place I &s;hall be more competent to di&s;play that open-hearted liberality which, in &s;o &s;hort a time, I might only have <HI>imagined</HI> they po&s;&s;e&s;s. But my ob&s;ervation cannot but be well founded, as they have le&s;s of hypocri&s;y than any &s;et of people I ever met with in my life.</P>
<P>A compact with any part of the public is with me a very &s;erious thing; therefore&mdash;though I was offered very hand&s;omely to &s;tay&mdash;I left LIVERPOOL,
<PB N="203" REF="210" MS="y">
and returned to HALIFAX&mdash;where my adverti&s;ements &s;tood for Thur&s;day the twenty-&s;eventh.</P>
<P>On chri&s;tmas-day, therefore, I left LIVERPOOL for MANCHESTER, and the following day&mdash;after being nearly lo&s;t in the &s;now, near ROCHDALE&mdash;arrived at HALIFAX. I think it would be doing inju&s;tice to &s;o well known a character, if I were to omit mentioning that in the diligence from LIVER|POOL to MANCHESTER I was accompanied by Mr. ASTLEY, who at that time was returning from LIVERPOOL, after having taken the town. From eight o'clock in the morning till five in the afternoon&mdash;for &s;o long is that dili|gence crawling thirty-&s;ix miles&mdash;I am &s;ure he did not cea&s;e, I will not &s;ay <HI>talking,</HI> but BAWLING; for this gentleman being eternally on his hobby-hor&s;e, always fancies he is holding conver&s;ation with Mr. MERRYMAN. In the cour&s;e of this curious rant, he was &s;o kind as to oblige me with his idea of improving the theatres, the courts, the parliament, and the nation. He wi&s;hed he had known what I was about, he would have given me &s;uch hints for my entertainment! In &s;hort, if I would but have li&s;tened to him, I &s;hould have had new rules for making mu&s;ic, writing, &s;inging, playing, and &s;peaking Engli&s;h. <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> hallowed he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is no talking to any of you. Now, there, about law&mdash;LORD THURLOW told me in my riding hou&s;e&mdash;but that's no matter. There now you &s;ee, there's that there PAL|MER, if I had a mind I would have &s;hewed him a trick that would have laid them all flat on their backs. For you &s;ee&mdash;to be &s;ure I knows nothing about <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> but I knows <HI>law</HI>; for I ca&s;t SIR JOSEPH MAWBY, and I have had &s;everal <HI>&s;uits,</HI> and I have been twice <HI>took up</HI>; but you &s;ee nobody won't be ruled by me, &s;o I goes on by my&s;elf&mdash;and what does I do? Why I cuts and contrives. Why where will you find &s;uch another <HI>monooverer?</HI>&mdash;learnt it in the army&mdash;under my particular friend and acquaintance GE|NERAL ELLIOT. Why don't you &s;ee what I am about now? I thinks our licences will carry us through&mdash;but if they &s;hould not you know&mdash;I am at a heavy charge&mdash;&s;o you &s;ee I goes about and gets the profit of a &s;ea&s;on
<PB N="204" REF="211" MS="y">
before the &s;ea&s;on comes."</Q> And good general&s;hip it has turned out, for I am credibly informed&mdash;at BIRMINGHAM, MANCHESTER, and LIVERPOOL&mdash;he cleared nearly two thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>While I was at LIVERPOOL the bu&s;ine&s;s or the <HI>&s;lave trade</HI> began to be agitated, and out of curio&s;ity I learned &s;ome particulars concerning it. The&s;e, however, I &s;hall defer till I mention what I gathered afterwards on that &s;ub|ject at MANCHESTER, and add the rejoinder of the people of LIVERPOOL, on my &s;econd vi&s;it to that place.</P>
<P>Whether any thing be done in this important bu&s;ine&s;s or not, the na|tional character of the Engli&s;h will derive an additional lu&s;tre from the hu|mane endeavours that have been exerted to annihilate a traffic which tho&s;e who have petitioned again&s;t it think cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive. Perhaps an inve&s;tiga|tion of the abu&s;es under the line may lead to an expo&s;ition and an amend|ment of tho&s;e at home.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to &s;peak of my &s;ucce&s;s at HALIFAX, and my return from thence to SHEFFIELD, which MOUN|TAIN (for I love to u&s;e <HI>hackneyed</HI> expre&s;&s;ions to <HI>mediocre</HI> &s;ubjects, notwith|&s;tanding LORD CHESTERFIELD to his &s;on reprobates them as vulgar, that he may keep them to him&s;elf I &s;uppo&s;e, for nobody has more) brought forth <HI>A MOUSE.</HI> But fir&s;t for HALIFAX.</P>
<P>I had two nights at this place, and con&s;idering the inhabitants of the <HI>neighbourhood</HI>&mdash;for this black, di&s;mal town has <HI>in it</HI> very few people of any con&s;equence&mdash;were locked up in their hou&s;es by the fro&s;t and &s;now, they turned out decent, but that was all. My audience, and indeed all HALIFAX and its environs, men, women, and children, being mu&s;ical, and, as &s;ome think, &s;quall in tune&mdash;ju&s;t as the negroes &s;wim&mdash;as &s;oon as they are born, my performance was <HI>critically</HI> attended to, but I am afraid not much liked.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MANZOLI and GUARDUCCI were competitors in ITALY; the public were to determine which &s;ung be&s;t;&mdash;MANZOLI had the voice of the <HI>&s;pectators</HI> and GUARDUCCI of the <HI>mu&s;icians</HI>;&mdash;what was the con&s;equence? MANZOLI made a fortune, and GUARDUCCI did nothing.</NOTE> I am, however, not very &s;orry this circum&s;tance occurred, for it gives me
<PB N="206" REF="213">
an opportunity, which will be more &s;trongly confirmed when I get to MANCHESTER, of noticing that the <HI>cono&s;centi</HI> ever receive the lea&s;t plea&s;ure, and, in fact, are the lea&s;t infallible. I &s;incerely believe, however, having pau&s;ed on the &s;econd night, and con&s;idered whether it was right to be plea&s;ed or not, they would have attended with more &s;atisfaction a third.&mdash;While they were deliberating, however, I was gone; for having received a letter from Mr. GALES, who was &s;o kind to make the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries concerning the entertainment, I got away to SHEFFIELD, on Monday De|cember the thirty-fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Of Mr. GALES I &s;carcely know how to &s;peak. He is the printer of this work: if, therefore, I &s;hould u&s;e &s;light language, it will look like a compact between us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GARRICK and LACY had this compact between them&mdash;whatever one prai&s;ed the other abu&s;ed.&mdash;When I made my article for &s;even years, immediately after the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> GARRICK was for giving me a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> and LACY for beating me down in every thing.&mdash;They &s;o well carried their point by this&mdash;GARRICK having previou&s;ly promi&s;ed me that whatever I con&s;ented to through LACY's whims, he would, through his own genero&s;ity, amply make up to me&mdash;that I agreed to receive &s;even pounds a week for what was worth more than double that &s;um. LACY having always had a regard for me, I could not help, a few days afterwards, telling him that he had been very hard on me in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the agreement.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What the devil would you have,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'twas DAVID's doings&mdash;he prompt|ed me."</Q></NOTE> and if I am lavi&s;h in my prai&s;es of him, &s;ome may be apt to quote from SHAKESPEARE, and &s;ay <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a little flattery &s;ometimes does well."</Q> I &s;hould therefore feel my&s;elf awkwardly &s;ituated but for one circum&s;tance, which has <HI>major,</HI> MINOR, and CONCLUSION in its favour, as <HI>clearly</HI> as any problem in EUCLID. <HI>Before</HI> I ever &s;aw Mr. GALES I had re|ceived numberle&s;s civilities at the hands of different <HI>printers,</HI> from many of whom I have had offers to print my TOUR&mdash;<HI>after</HI> I knew Mr. GALES, I pre|ferred him to all the printers I had &s;een.

<PB N="207" REF="214">
to have printed it unknown to his ma&s;ter; for &s;o diffident is he of his own worth, that I &s;hould never have prevailed on him to let that i&s;&s;ue from the pre&s;s which would have been as great a credit to the public as any thing that ever did or ever will pa&s;s through it. Another circum&s;tance will by and by oblige me to &s;peak in Mr. GALES's favour in &s;pite of his teeth. Among my general &s;ubjects, it will be very proper to take up new&s;papers, in which ca&s;e it would be very <HI>improper</HI> not to mention the <HI>Sheffield Regi&s;ter</HI> with that de|gree of prai&s;e it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>My <HI>fir&s;t</HI> night at SHEFFIELD, notwith&s;tanding I had beat about almo&s;t expre&s;&s;ly for ten weeks, with a view of properly paying them a vi&s;it, was a very bad one; and feeling my&s;elf a little let down, I &s;hould not have an|nounced a &s;econd but for the per&s;ua&s;ion of two or three gentlemen; and the conditions I made were, that my continuing the performance for any length of time at SHEFFIELD, &s;hould depend wholly on the degree of &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;econd evening, which turning out but very little better than the fir&s;t, I gave the matter up&mdash;nor could any per&s;ua&s;ions induce me to re&s;ume it. I can &s;carcely account for that &s;trange kind of caprice through which people take &s;o much pains to manife&s;t the in&s;tability of their minds. Nothing could be warmer than the apparent heartine&s;s with which I was entreated to return to SHEFFIELD, nor any thing cooler than my reception when I did return. My welcome, to a &s;tranger, would have &s;eemed as if I had been &s;ent away with contumely, and they had wondered at my impudence at intruding my|&s;elf among them a &s;econd time. I looked down upon it, as I can do&mdash;heaven be prai&s;ed&mdash;when I ought, with a calm and tranquil mixture of pity and in|difference; and, though not one of all the number who te&s;tified &s;uch &s;atis|faction at my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> vi&s;it came near me on my <HI>&s;econd,</HI> I contented my&s;elf with a reflection, that as it is the lot of mankind to be fickle, and this worthy quality is generally influenced by local prejudice, it mu&s;t have ari&s;en, as the French &s;ay, from <HI>L'air du pais,</HI> and I have only to con&s;ider that the <HI>iron</HI> which was <HI>hot</HI> when I fir&s;t went there, had <HI>cooled</HI> in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215">To &s;hew, however, that I have a plea&s;ure in being ju&s;t, I here publicly thank the inhabitants of SHEFFIELD for bringing me back, even with all this obloquy, for through it I acquired the friend&s;hip of Mr. GALES, and the &s;atisfaction of employing him to print this work.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY labour-in-vain expedition to SHEFFIELD hav+ing trifled away that whole week, a non&s;en&s;ical bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tarted up which lo&s;t me the next. From the little town of ROTHERHAM, a propo&s;al was &s;ent me which, to this moment, I can &s;carcely make head or tail of. My inten|tion was to have performed at MANCHESTER on the Tue&s;day, I however received a me&s;&s;age that it would be a profit to me, and a plea&s;ure to the people of ROTHERHAM, if I would give them a night there, and that LADY EFFINGHAM had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to that effect. The inhabitants of that place, after putting me to &s;ome expence, and making me lo&s;e my time, cho&s;e, however, to affect a perfect indifference about the matter, and no night took place.</P>
<P>The following letter, which I wrote to clear my&s;elf from any &s;u&s;picion of di&s;re&s;pect to LADY EFFINGHAM, who &s;uffered me to &s;ay in the bills that the entertainment was at her particular de&s;ire, will elucidate this curious bu|&s;ine&s;s a little better.</P>

<P>I &s;carcely know in what words to apologize to your LA|DYSHIP for making &s;o ill a return to your conde&s;cen&s;ion as to di&s;appoint you of my performance at ROTHERHAM. The actual rea&s;on, however, which I &s;hall briefly &s;tate, will infallibly exculpate me from any intention of abu&s;ing the very generous and hand&s;ome liberality with which you did me the honour to permit the u&s;e of your name; which circum&s;tance, had I not been precluded from circulating it, mu&s;t have procured me an ample attendance.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al, through Mr. WEBB of SHEFFIELD, came to me from YOUR LADYSHIP and Mr. WALKER; and Mr. WEBB went &s;o far as to a&s;k what &s;um would &s;atisfy me for my trouble of going to ROTHERHAM. My an&s;wer&mdash;as it has con&s;tantly been whenever I hear of liberal names and liberal intentions&mdash;was, that I was certainly &s;afe in relying on whatever the gentlemen of ROTHERHAM, influenced by your LADYSHIP and Mr. WAL|KER, might think proper to do; and as I am very tenacious of not being con&s;idered merely as a common exhibiter&mdash;my entertainment having been fabricated &s;olely with a view to te&s;tify my gratitude to a generous public, previous to my embarkment for INDIA&mdash;I told Mr. WEBB that if the night failed, there would be abundant opportunity of making me amends, with|out any extra-pecuniary gratification, by promoting the &s;ub&s;cription of my MUSICAL TOUR. Mr. WEBB undertook to procure me an an&s;wer by <HI>noon</HI> on Sunday, and I promi&s;ed not to go &s;o &s;oon to MANCHESTER. On Sunday night, however, hearing nothing of Mr. WEBB, I wrote to him, and re|ceived a verbal an&s;wer that I mu&s;t wait on Dr. WAINWRIGHT. Determined to know &s;omething more of this bu&s;ine&s;s, I called at Doctor WAIN|WRIGHT's in the morning. I &s;aw only Mrs. WAINWRIGHT, who corro|borated all that Mr. WEBB had told me; adding, that the Doctor had com|mi&s;&s;ioned Mr. WEBB to treat with me, that he would be on that day at
<PB N="211" REF="218">
ROTHERHAM, that there would be a meeting of the gentlemen, and her advice was that I &s;hould immediately go there. This I fully intended, had I not by accident &s;een your LADYSHIP. This circum&s;tance determined me to &s;tay at SHEFFIELD, and &s;olicit your name to my bill, which reque&s;t you did me the honour &s;o hand&s;omely to grant. In the interim, however, I wrote to Dr. WAINWRIGHT, and &s;ent &s;ome general bills for circulation; but Dr. WAINWRIGHT, having left ROTHERHAM before the arrival of my letter, it was referred to the gentlemen at the meeting, and they agreed to write me word that they were ALL ENGAGED on Tue&s;day even|ing, and could not attend me. This letter not being given to the man till pa&s;t nine o'clock in the evening, he did not return to SHEFFIELD till ye&s;|terday morning, <HI>after</HI> I had &s;et out to ROTHERHAM, prepared for the per|formance.</P>
<P>On my arrival there, the woman at the po&s;t-office informed me that Mr. WALKER had written me a letter, and if I had not received it, Mr. TUCKER would tell me its contents. I waited on Mr. TUCKER, who blamed me for not giving more notice, and letting the gentlemen know <HI>my</HI> intention &s;ooner. I repre&s;ented that I had but one intention about it&mdash;which was, <HI>not</HI> to go to ROTHERHAM, had I not been &s;trongly &s;olicited&mdash;but, that, hearing your LADYSHIP's name and Mr. WALKER's &s;o repeat|edly mentioned, I had been induced to comply with what was extremely inconvenient to me. Mr. TUCKER informed me that if I performed no|body could be there&mdash;but, to comfort me, that gentleman was &s;o good as to &s;ay that, even if he did not come him&s;elf, he would &s;end his half crown. I &s;miled at the compliment, but could not help &s;o far feeling for my&s;elf as to &s;ay that half a crown was probably no more an object to me than to him. He advi&s;ed me, at all adventures, to &s;ee Mr. WALKER, for whom I immediately &s;ought, but finding he was gone to SHEFFIELD, I &s;aw I had nothing for it but to wait on your LADYSHIP, make my apology, and in|form you hone&s;tly of what had happened&mdash;but, on coming to the inn, I found that, in my ab&s;ence, the landlord had put the hor&s;es which drew me to ROTHERHAM to Mr. WALKER's carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="219">Thus, prevented every way from paying your LADYSHIP that defe|rence and re&s;pect which are not more your due from your high and di&s;|tingui&s;hed &s;ituation than from your affability and conde&s;cending benevo|lence, I have nothing to re&s;ort to but this letter; which will, I doubt not, &s;ufficiently convince you that I have in no re&s;pect been to blame; but, on the contrary&mdash;as this tran&s;action has put me to &s;ome expence, and prevented my receiving advantage el&s;ewhere&mdash;I have a right to con&s;ider it as as a piece of very unhand&s;ome treatment; which I feel the more &s;everely, having through it, though not wilfully, di&s;appointed your LADY|SHIP, and given you &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary trouble.</P>

<P>As I could have proved lo&s;s of time and money in this tran&s;action, I think it would have been no bad hit to have propo&s;ed to Mr. TUCKER&mdash;who, be it known, is a worthy member of the law&mdash;an action again&s;t Mr. WEBB; for if one may judge by the liberal offer of the half crown, he would have joined i&s;&s;ue in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s with me.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday, January the 12th, I went from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER, by the way of CASTLETON, and of cour&s;e over tho&s;e tremendous hills which form the mo&s;t romantic part of the won|ders of the Peak&mdash;but the&s;e I &s;hall more particularly de&s;cribe hereafter. On the Sunday I waited on two gentlemen of con&s;equence in MANCHESTER, and came away &s;o &s;atisfied, that I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould find equal &s;ucce&s;s there to that I met with at LIVERPOOL. In the highe&s;t &s;pirits, therefore, I adver|ti&s;ed, at a venture, three nights&mdash;Tue&s;day the fifteenth, Thur&s;day the &s;even|teenth, and Friday the eighteenth&mdash;and on tho&s;e three nights I received almo&s;t <HI>one half</HI> of the &s;um which the <HI>la&s;t night</HI> yielded me at LIVERPOOL. The re|ception of the entertainment &s;macked a little of HALIFAX, the judges <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"bore a <HI>wary</HI> eye,"</Q> and people, holding tight the captive half crown, made &s;trict enquiries into the value to be received before they could mu&s;ter up re&s;olution to liberate the coin. To &s;ay the truth, I was at la&s;t a&s;hamed of them, and, out of pity, relieved them from their unea&s;ine&s;s, by bidding MANCHESTER adieu.</P>
<P>To rever&s;e what I have &s;aid of LIVERPOOL, let me not be cen&s;ured if&mdash;faithful to my promi&s;e of telling the truth&mdash;I &s;hould be obliged to place MAN|CHESTER
<PB N="214" REF="221">
in an unfavourable point of view. My di&s;appointment there will tell the &s;tory for me. At LIVERPOOL I had no previous recommendation that could influence the leading people. At MANCHESTER, a gentleman of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in the town introduced me per&s;onally to all whom he could devi&s;e might be of &s;ervice to me; and, on my account, gave a &s;upper, to which he invited a large number of his particular friends, on the night <HI>before</HI> the fir&s;t performance. Nor did they want a reporter, and a very able one, of what they were going to hear. One of the gentlemen pre&s;ent had been at the amu&s;ement the la&s;t night at LIVERPOOL, and &s;poke in the kinde&s;t way, not only of the thing it&s;elf, but of the liberal treatment I had received; in&s;tancing in particular, that as the concert had been on that very night, many who had indi&s;pen&s;ible engagements there, ju&s;t made their appearance, and then devoted the remainder of the evening <HI>to me</HI>&mdash;a kind of attention he wi&s;hed to &s;ee imi|tated at MANCHESTER. Neverthele&s;s, the fact was as I have related. At my coming away, I might have had any thing if I would give them a night or two more, which I took as it was meant&mdash;a mere promi&s;e&mdash;and declined it as it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>It was allowed, on all hands, I had been very ill treated, and it was &s;aid, as I had failed in the <HI>entertainment</HI> it &s;hould be made up to me in <HI>&s;ub&s;crip|tion</HI>; and they hoped, if I found that to be the ca&s;e, I would yet in the cour&s;e of &s;ome weeks pay them another vi&s;it. This I promi&s;ed to do; but pa&s;&s;ing two months afterwards through the place, and finding that there was not a &s;ingle <HI>additional</HI> name to my <HI>&s;ub&s;cription,</HI> I forewent my intention of calling on any per&s;on be&s;ide the book&s;ellers&mdash;and left MANCHESTER with an opinion which I am very &s;orry to be convinced it merits.</P>
<P>Let me not however be &s;o ungrateful as to neglect &s;aying that from one gentleman&mdash;who&s;e name all MANCHESTER will recollect without my menti|oning it&mdash;I received a warm and friendly attention beyond my abilities to de|&s;cribe. If he had intreated for a favour to be conferred on him&s;elf, he could not have been more &s;olicitous, more anxious, or more indu&s;trious. Indeed I
<PB N="215" REF="222">
wi&s;h I had never gone to MANCHESTER; for I am &s;ure there are many of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves his friends, whom&mdash;after this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;he can never cor|dially think &s;o. I take leave in this place to thank that gentleman, and to a&s;|&s;ure him that no length of time or change of &s;ituation &s;hall ever efface his kindne&s;s from my memory.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s would have turned out better if it had been undertaken by any body but this gentleman; and will it be believed why? He knew no|thing of mu&s;ic. 'Twas in vain that he held out, with the greate&s;t good-nature, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Am I obliged to learn <HI>&s;ol fa</HI> to receive plea&s;ure when I hear an agreeable &s;ong!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. DIBDIN ought to have been taken up by the cono&s;centi,"</Q> who I would lay my life would be the very fir&s;t to pick a hole in his coat.</P>
<P>This and the promi&s;ed plea&s;ure of the en&s;uing week, when a new organ was to be opened at their concert room, deprived me of all the <HI>gentlemen</HI> mu|&s;icians. Mr. GREEN, who was putting up the organ, was a deity among them. Have you &s;een him? What &s;ort of man is he? Oh &s;ir, he is a won|derful creature! In &s;hort, they were &s;o full of it, that I expected to &s;ee a portrait of the organ and organ-maker in the next MANCHESTER <HI>print</HI>; and yet, with all this fu&s;s, when the grand day came, they had not&mdash;after &s;uch an expence and &s;o long a notice&mdash;two-thirds of the number that u&s;ually attend a common concert at LIVERPOOL.</P>
<P>The narrowne&s;s that characteri&s;es the people of MANCHESTER is not con|fined to their plea&s;ures, it is evidently apparent in their trade. Con&s;idering them as a community, they are like an army of MERCENARIES. At their head are a few individuals of con&s;equence, under whom all the re&s;t are doomed to &s;erve in perpetual &s;ubordination; but LIVERPOOL is a corps of volunteers in which any may ri&s;e by indu&s;try, merit, and per&s;everance, to the highe&s;t po&s;ts. Some few at MANCHESTER mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be immen&s;ely wealthy, but it is impo&s;&s;ible that it can boa&s;t, within a prodigious &s;um indeed, the ag|gregate riches of LIVERPOOL. As therefore the wealth falls comparatively
<PB N="216" REF="223">
into a few hands&mdash;the trade&s;man-like plodding routine of who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to pay weekly wages and &s;ettle &s;hort credits&mdash;there cannot be the &s;ame exten&s;ion of ideas, the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for a large &s;cale of calculation, for a competent knowledge of the comparative intere&s;ts of nations, for clear and well-dige&s;ted general intelligence, and all tho&s;e other important mental requi&s;ites which make up the broad, comprehen&s;ive pur&s;uits of a merchant. In &s;hort, MANCHES|TER, where a &s;mall number hoard con&s;iderable wealth, and the re&s;t are merely paid for their labour, cannot, on the &s;cale of commerce, be put in competi|tion with LIVERPOOL; where the tide of trea&s;ure&mdash;like the &s;ea that produces it&mdash;rolls in a wide and expan&s;ive circulation; nor is it more conducive to pri|vate and partial advantage than general convenience.</P>
<P>Men however of the&s;e contracted principles generally are &s;trictly hone&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the le&s;&s;er virtues with as much punctuality and exactne&s;s as they honour a bill of exchange; and there can be no doubt but from the timidity attendant on the common moral duties of life, and an anxiety to comply as far as men can with the letter of that religion they punctually attend the cere|monies of&mdash;by way of example to their children and &s;ervants&mdash;the humanity &s;o evidently manife&s;t in the pre&s;ent efforts to aboli&s;h the <HI>&s;lave trade</HI> had its ri&s;e, The motive beyond contradiction is laudable.</P>
<P>After examining, in my next letter, whether the people of MANCHES|TER get or lo&s;e by &s;etting them&s;elves up rather as <HI>judges</HI> than as <HI>lovers</HI> of MU|SIC, I &s;hall proceed to inve&s;tigate their arguments relative to this important &s;ub|ject, place tho&s;e of LIVERPOOL by the &s;ide of them, and &s;ee whether their ge|neral policy merits that attention from the legi&s;lature they expect, or whether it has proceeded from that ruling pa&s;&s;ion which POPE &s;ays time it&s;elf cannot tame; and he might have added, had he known my friend&s;hip, any more than it can the &s;incerity with which I profe&s;s to be</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME years ago there was a party of critics who con&s;tantly made a point of attending the <HI>theatres.</HI> They were always headed by a chief, whom they di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Mr. TOWN; and this gentleman being cho&s;en for his &s;uperior adroitne&s;s at di&s;covering the faults of authors, very gravely&mdash;in the name he had the mode&s;ty to a&s;&s;ume&mdash;pronounced the fate of many a trembling poet and compo&s;er. It happened however after a length of time, that indifferent people, who really went to the <HI>theatres</HI> to be plea&s;ed, and to judge for them&s;elves, thought proper to take up the bu&s;ine&s;s, and a few ineffectual &s;truggles over, Mr. TOWN and his partizans were obliged to leave the field in di&s;grace, and withdraw to pot hou&s;es, their ma&s;ter's offices, or &s;uch other ob&s;cure retreats, from which they originally i&s;&s;ued, in arrogant expectation of giving the ton to an opulent metropolis in an enligh|tened age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mo&s;t ludicrous in&s;tance of the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of an actor, through the <HI>fiat</HI> of Mr. TOWN, happened in Goodman's Fields. A GENTLEMAN was announced for the character of MACBETH, and went thro' it with &s;o much reputation that it was agreed to give it out for the following night. A Mi&s;s BUDGEL played LADY MACBETH, and it &s;o happened that during his acquaintance with that lady, at the dif|ferent rehear&s;als, he fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with his <HI>theatrical</HI> wife&mdash;which misfortune might not have happened to him had &s;he been his <HI>real</HI> one. During the time of the performance he was more enrap|tured than ever. After it was over, &s;tanding near her, by the &s;ide of the &s;cenes, receiving her warm compliments and congratulations, an actor, who had per&s;onated one of the witches, was &s;ent on the &s;tage to announce a repetition of the performance on the following night. The audience, the moment the man appeared, bur&s;t into a loud laugh. MACBETH could not conceive whence this aro&s;e, till, looking on the &s;tage, he &s;aw the actor who had began to arrange him&s;elf for the farce, with his hair &s;inely dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome of the witches rags hanging about him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God ble&s;s me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis mighty ridiculous to &s;end this &s;tupid fellow on the &s;tage&mdash;what &s;hall we do?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My dear Sir,</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s BUDGEL, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you have nothing for it but to give it out your&s;elf.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear creature,"</Q> returned the charmed MACBETH, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll do it&mdash;my &s;weet Mi&s;s BUDGEL!&mdash;dear, charming Mi&s;s BUDGEL!"</Q>&mdash;On he ru&s;hed, full of the idea of Mi&s;s BUDGEL, and, as &s;oon as he could be heard, he thundered out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ladies and gentlemen, to morrow evening&mdash;Mi&s;s BUDGEL will be <HI>done over again.</HI>"</Q> Mr. TOUN found &s;omething indelicate in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and poor MACBETH was bani&s;hed from the theatre.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225">This party has never been entirely quelled, their fury however now vents it&s;elf only in bickerings at coffee hou&s;es, &s;narling in the box lobby, or now and then a &s;quib in the new&s;papers; but this la&s;t never happens, unle&s;s inte|re&s;t be made with the under&s;trappers when the editor is out of the way&mdash;for free tickets, the performance of now and then a farce, and other douceurs, have locked up the new&s;papers from the admi&s;&s;ion of any &s;trictures relative to the theatres, but &s;uch as are within the de&s;cription of Mr. SHERIDAN's li&s;t of <HI>puffs</HI> in <HI>The Critic.</HI> Le&s;t this la&s;t policy however &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to in&s;ure to the <HI>managers</HI> all the &s;ucce&s;s it may be <HI>convenient</HI> to command&mdash;for that it has been &s;ometimes thought expedient to accelerate the damnation of pieces I <HI>know</HI> to be a fact&mdash;a formidable phalanx of <HI>orderly</HI> people are &s;tationed to cru&s;h in its infancy every attempt at a riot.

<P>Scions from this old &s;tock of party &s;eem pretty freely to have &s;pread them|&s;elves over mo&s;t of the towns of con&s;equence in this kingdom. Playhou&s;e critics however have in the country very little to do; for by then they have &s;een <HI>Macbeth</HI> two or three times break his truncheon&mdash;<HI>Richard</HI> &s;tart at the gho&s;ts, all the men have fallen in love, and all the women envied &s;ome <HI>bloom|ing</HI> actre&s;s of <HI>&s;ixty</HI>; and a few of the fir&s;t rate having gone to LONDON for orders, and &s;een the performers there, have pronounced the country actors to be <HI>damned &s;tuff</HI>&mdash;expended curio&s;ity dies away, and the unfortunate &s;ons and daughters of <HI>The&s;pis</HI> having &s;tamped, roared, grinned, and &s;qualled as long as any 'prentice boys are to be found to make up their gallery, are obliged to take to their cart and undergo the &s;ame humiliation in &s;ome other place.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;ical critics</HI> have a great deal more to do. An attorney's clerk who can play WEIDEMAN's minuet joins a mercer's apprentice, who, from fre|quenting hops has learnt to &s;crape a little of one of the city waites. The at|torney decamped&mdash;perhaps after being pilloried for perjury, and the mercer become a bankrupt, the clerk and the apprentice are in bu&s;ine&s;s for them&s;elves. Perhaps one becomes an alderman and the other a town-clerk. A &s;ub&s;crip|tion is now propo&s;ed, a concert-room is built, where the MERCER <HI>leads,</HI> and the ATTORNEY <HI>plays &s;olos.</HI> The plan is at length extended, till in the race-week, at the a&s;&s;izes, or &s;ome other public &s;ea&s;on, whatever &s;inger happens then to be popular is invited, an oratorio performed, and Me&s;&s;ieurs LATITAT
<PB N="220" REF="227">
and REMNANT quit the <HI>red tails</HI> and the <HI>quality binding,</HI> to emulate&mdash;in noi&s;e at lea&s;t&mdash;the fe&s;tivals of the Abbey.</P>
<P>I really mean no more by my MERCER and ATTORNEY than the latter would by A and B did he put a ca&s;e. What I have in&s;tanced is virtually the fact; and it has this operation. If it &s;o happen that the <HI>lovers</HI> of mu&s;ic out-number the <HI>judges</HI>&mdash;as they call them&s;elves&mdash;every thing will be conducted upon a broad, liberal plan, and the concert do honour to the place, by giving encouragement to men of abilities and refining the ta&s;te of the inhabitants; if on the contrary the <HI>judges</HI> have a majority, it will be carried on upon a nar|row, jealous, contracted &s;cale. The mu&s;ic will be injudiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, an unnece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence a&s;&s;umed; and at length, what was meant as an har|monic meeting will become a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, till the gentlemen players have no opportunity to di&s;play the brilliancy of their &s;uperior talents, but thro' the mortifying medium of private meetings at each other's hou&s;es. At LI|VERPOOL, the <HI>lovers</HI> have the majority <HI>twenty</HI>&mdash;perhaps <HI>fifty</HI>&mdash;to one: At MANCHESTER, I am afraid it goes as &s;trongly in favour of the <HI>judges.</HI> Let them therefore take care not to follow the example of LEEDS; where&mdash;and I have already &s;hewn why&mdash;there will not, in all probability, next year be a concert at all. None of this would however be worth a comment, if the &s;ports of the&s;e children&mdash;like the others in the fable of the frogs&mdash;was not the death of genius, and con&s;equently the cau&s;e of &s;tagnating that profe&s;&s;ion they pretend to encourage.</P>

<P>That it is a di&s;grace to humanity, and a reproach to a nation which boa&s;ts the milde&s;t government, and profe&s;&s;es the ju&s;te&s;t religion upon earth, to buy and &s;ell our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>That the Engli&s;h, not contented with the pri&s;oners taken in tho&s;e wars among the different powers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the coa&s;t of AFRICA, which are provoked by their own jealou&s;ies and other private motives, irritate the natives to commit partial depredations on each other, and thus unnece&s;&s;arily are the cau&s;e of &s;pilling human blood, and laying wa&s;te the habitations of harmle&s;s and peace|able individuals, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying &s;laves for the markets in the WEST-INDIES.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="229">That the&s;e poor wretches are treated with the mo&s;t inhuman cruelty; that on board of &s;hip they are &s;tived down in the hold, without the &s;malle&s;t re&s;pect to &s;ex or age, or any regard to common decency; and that if they re|pine, chains, whips, and thumb-&s;crews, bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;erable condition, and the &s;cene often ends with their embracing death to free them from a wor&s;e calamity; that this cruelty extends throughout the whole term of their &s;lavery, which&mdash;unle&s;s they can rai&s;e a &s;um, generally impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;is for life; that they are cart-whipt and treated with much other cruelty, under which a white man would expire, for the mo&s;t trivial faults; and that four years generally wear out&mdash;owing to this reiterated torture&mdash;the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions among them, when they fall willing victims to their dreadful fate, which becomes a &s;tanding and indelible reproach to the name of Eng|li&s;hman.</P>
<P>That there have been &s;ome in&s;tances to the contrary, &s;ince all the world is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame want of feeling; that indeed they have been rare, but when they have happened, the planter has found his fir&s;t &s;tock become &s;ufficiently numerous to an&s;wer all his purpo&s;es&mdash;for by gentlene&s;s and kind treatment they have increa&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hingly, and, as his humane endeavours have been evidently vi&s;ited by a ble&s;&s;ing from heaven, he has ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e riches&mdash;while the negroes have extolled <HI>him</HI> as a <HI>benefactor,</HI> whom they ex|pected to find a grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive <HI>ta&s;k ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>That a planter may take away the life of a &s;lave without being in the &s;malle&s;t degree accountable for his actions.</P>
<P>That the GUINEA trade, over and above the other evils which attend it, is the de&s;truction of many brave Engli&s;hmen, ina&s;much as that the flower of our intrepid tars find a grave upon the coa&s;t of AFRICA.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="230">That the abolition of this unnatural traffic would be rather a benefit than a di&s;advantage as to the con&s;umption of our commodities, for that we might then have returns in articles the produce of that country.</P>
<P>That a total abolition of the &s;lave trade, and nothing le&s;s, would go to a reform of the grievances ari&s;ing from it; for, by being convinced that they could no longer recruit their &s;tock from the old market, planters would cea&s;e to be wantonly cruel, and naturally turn their thoughts to the care and pre|&s;ervation of the &s;laves then upon their hands, imitating the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the merciful We&s;t-Indian before mentioned, which would produce many great and &s;alutary effects. The planter, contenting him&s;elf with the &s;laves already in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would, as the negroes are naturally prolific, increa&s;e his &s;tock every year; al&s;o having no more purcha&s;e-money to pay, he could in a &s;hort time be enabled to part with his &s;ugar and rum cheaper than formerly, and thus we could afford to under&s;ell all the other We&s;t-India i&s;lands. That the&s;e de&s;irable ble&s;&s;ings would perpetuate the merciful reign of GEORGE the Third, and finally, to the end of time, &s;tand forward as as an example of hu|manity unparalelled in the annals of the world.</P>
<P>Many other inland towns having caught fire at the long enumeration of <HI>grievances</HI> &s;u&s;tained, and advantages that would ari&s;e from the extirpation of the cau&s;e of tho&s;e grievances, have, to their honour, taken up the &s;ubject, and in a variety of petitions&mdash;among which that of SHEFFIELD is one of the be&s;t written&mdash;be&s;ought parliament to interpo&s;e their authority, and put a &s;top to this growing evil; and they hold out what appears to be a &s;trong proof of the hand&s;ome di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of MANCHESTER, namely, that their goods go now to purcha&s;e the African &s;laves, whereas they are willing to forego all ad|vantage as <HI>dealers,</HI> rather than be remi&s;s in their duty as <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e petitions look forward to the happy con&s;equences that they &s;ay would be derived from &s;o noble an exerci&s;e of Engli&s;h philanthropy. In them
<PB N="224" REF="231">
is introduced every argument that genero&s;ity can dictate, and the mo&s;t power|ful language u&s;ed to intreat the legi&s;lature to protect the &s;avages, and to in|duce the merchants who have an intere&s;t in that trade nobly to throw it up with the &s;ame greatne&s;s of mind in which they have been &s;et &s;o laudable an example by the benevolent inhabitants of MANCHESTER.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the petitioners, a number of &s;ocieties have formed, who &s;plit the different que&s;tions into every po&s;&s;ible divi&s;ion; but as this would take off from the &s;olemnity of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eem as if I wi&s;hed to &s;upply LIVERPOOL with opportuity to introduce palliating &s;ubterfuges, I &s;hall, in my next letter, let them meet the que&s;tion on its pre&s;ent ground. After which, the reader and I will fairly compare both arguments&mdash;which done, I &s;hall leave him as a jury to decide upon the merits of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mercy upon poor LIVERPOOL, if the arguments of MANCHESTER be found as infallible, as that I am,</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN reply to the&s;e charges, LIVERPOOL &s;ays,</P>
<P>That if there can be no rea&s;on, &s;upported by &s;ound policy, legi&s;lative nece&s;&s;ity, or any of tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able urgencies which in all politics occa&s;ion|ally introduce a partial and apparent oppre&s;&s;ion for the &s;ake of general conve|nience, the African <HI>&s;lave trade</HI> is as it has been repre&s;ented&mdash;an infamous traf|fic, and a di&s;grace to the national character of the Engli&s;h; but if it be made appear that it is perfectly expedient, and al&s;o that it is a ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;in&s;tead of a misfortune&mdash;to the &s;avages, who&s;e Situations are &s;o loudly and vehemently de|plored, they conceive the various petitions for its abolition ought to be thrown out&mdash;though certainly originating from benevolent intentions&mdash;as frivolous and vexatious.</P>
<P>That &s;o fal&s;e is the report that the Engli&s;h provoke wars up the country on the coa&s;t of AFRICA, for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing &s;laves, no Engli&s;hman ever yet returned who ventured five miles from the &s;hore. That were the Engli&s;h &s;o inhuman as to meditate any &s;uch thing, it is perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary. The nations on the coa&s;t of AFRICA are remarkably prolific, and naturally
<PB N="226" REF="233">
lazy, cultivation is &s;carcely known among them, and fi&s;hing and hunting procure them the only ble&s;&s;ings of life their &s;avage nature is capable of enter|taining a conception of. There are among them many tribes, and they are never without being in &s;ome place or other at war. The pri&s;oners made in the&s;e wars are doomed &s;ome to be <HI>&s;acrificed,</HI> &s;ome <HI>eaten</HI>&mdash;for they are cannibals to a man&mdash;and &s;ome <HI>&s;old.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t are purcha&s;ed by the ENGLISH, the DUTCH, the FRENCH, the PORTUGUESE, the SPANISH, the DANES, and, as all the world knows, by many other nations. Do all tho&s;e go up the country to provoke wars? Or do they lay in wait for the poor captives who are tricked by the in&s;idious arts of Engli&s;hmen into unnece&s;&s;ary quarrels? Bravery, and all the genero&s;ity attending on it, is the characteri&s;tic of Engli&s;hmen. Why then &s;hould their fellow country men load them with &s;uch unworthy &s;u&s;picions? But the wars alone do not furni&s;h the &s;laves &s;old upon the coa&s;t of GUINEA. If a negro have thirty wives, they are his &s;laves, &s;o are their children; and it is not uncu&s;tomary to &s;ee a man &s;ell his whole family. Of the poor devoted wretches taken in war, tho&s;e who are &s;old are the happie&s;t, unle&s;s it can be proved that they are treated with all that cruelty which again is rather har&s;hly laid to the charge of Engli&s;hmen; in which ca&s;e indeed, <HI>death</HI> were de&s;irable. The&s;e poor wretches are brought forth&mdash;&s;uch a number are put apart to be EATEN at the public &s;acrifices, the re&s;t are carried to market&mdash;the refu&s;e of whom, which always amounts to a con&s;iderable number, are beheaded, and then&mdash;or perhaps alive, as a prey to the &s;harks&mdash;thrown into the &s;ea. A gen|tleman, from who&s;e mouth this is taken, &s;ays that a Captain FARRER, after having purcha&s;ed as many as his &s;hip would conveniently contain, &s;aw tho&s;e he had refu&s;ed to buy, beheaded before his face to the number of &s;ixty-two.</P>
<P>That on board of &s;hip no &s;lave was ever treated but with the greate&s;t mildne&s;s and lenity, unle&s;s he were mutinous, in which ca&s;e common policy will make it nece&s;&s;ary to be a little rigorous. That the accommodations are &s;tudiou&s;ly laid out for their convenience,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I am competent to &s;peak to, having my&s;elf examined a Guineaman with the mo&s;t minute attention.</NOTE> and every effort exerted to pre&s;erve
<PB N="227" REF="234">
them in health and vigour. Indeed, if Engli&s;hmen had all that ferocity at pre&s;ent attributed to them; if they could be hardened enough to gall a poor de|fencele&s;s &s;lave with chains, flog him into &s;ickne&s;s, and invent new horrors to increa&s;e the calamity of his &s;ituation&mdash;their intere&s;t would forbid it. They mu&s;t be madmen to brave an unhealthy clime, and expend immen&s;e &s;ums to purcha&s;e a &s;et of mi&s;erable objects merely to exerci&s;e on them &s;o much wanton barbarity. When the &s;laves come to the We&s;t-Indian, by being re-purcha&s;ed at a higher price, it &s;till more behoves their ma&s;ters to attend to their treat|ment. They are certainly &s;et to work, but their labour is not within any de|gree of compari&s;on equal to that of a farmer's man, who, at the harve&s;t time, has not a &s;ingle hour's ce&s;&s;ation from binding and carrying, from three o'clock in the morning till nine at night&mdash;whereas a negro can never work but from &s;ix to &s;ix. In &s;hort, any Engli&s;h labourer is worked much harder&mdash;but then the climate! Why it is congenial to their nature&mdash;but the cart whip! Is nothing. They are lazy beyond any thing that can be conceived; and if they were not &s;timulated to it, would do nothing. But it is a mi&s;take that a planter can whip a negro to death&mdash;he mu&s;t receive but thirty-nine la&s;hes; and if every one of the thirty-nine were ten, they would be &s;till nothing to a dozen at the gangway. That &s;o far from the planter's treating them with any thing but general kindne&s;s&mdash;for he mu&s;t not &s;uffer them to get the upper hand of him, unle&s;s he chu&s;es to have his throat cut&mdash;every negro has his little &s;pot of ground, from which the markets are &s;upplied with vegetables on a Sunday, with the produce of which they make little parties of plea&s;ure, have their balls and different pa&s;times, and, unle&s;s it be &s;ome few moody malecontents&mdash;which are to be found in all &s;tates&mdash;are as happy as any people under the &s;un. Nei|ther is this ground taken away from them&mdash;as &s;ome a&s;&s;ert&mdash;when they have brought it to perfection; for if this were the ca&s;e, where would they get the money to purcha&s;e their freedom, which happens every day.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, a negro's idea when he is purcha&s;ed is, that he is to be eaten; and as nothing can induce him to drive this idea from his imagination&mdash;for
<PB N="228" REF="235">
per&s;uading him to the contrary confirms it the &s;tronger, as he thinks he is only told &s;o that he may become <HI>chearful</HI> and get <HI>fat</HI>&mdash;therefore they generally come to market very thin, which probably has given ri&s;e to the report of their being cruelly treated at &s;ea&mdash;but when he finds he is only to work, and &s;ees him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of his countrymen, who have wives and families and are happy, only upon condition that they labour a little, he, like them, buckles to his &s;ituation, and finds that the bread he regularly earns by indu&s;try, is &s;weeter than the precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tance he before picked up&mdash;which perhaps was not procured till his poi&s;oned arrow had drank the blood of his countryman.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE objections of LIVERPOOL to the a&s;&s;ertions of MANCHESTER, go on thus.</P>
<P>That certainly tho&s;e who treat the &s;laves with the mo&s;t lenity &s;tand a chance of being be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their &s;ervices; but the in&s;tance adduced that they are likely, through good treatment alone, to grow &s;ufficiently populous for the WEST-INDIES to need no further &s;upply of them, is a mo&s;t extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion. It is well known there are very few women brought from AFRICA, and many of the&s;e, through their connections with white men, get their li|berty. This is certainly a &s;ubject not to be defended upon rational principles, but it is a worldly ble&s;&s;ing which the negroes have a very &s;trong reli&s;h for; and that the fact exi&s;ts, witne&s;s all tho&s;e degrees of complection under the titles of Mulatto, Mu&s;tee, &amp;c. who at la&s;t enjoy the immunities of Engli&s;hmen, and become planters them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, it can never be credited that, if there were any po&s;&s;ible means of keeping up a &s;ufficient &s;tock without a fre&s;h &s;upply, that men would lavi&s;h away large &s;ums to purcha&s;e new &s;laves merely for the plea&s;ure of treating them ill.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237">That a planter cannot take away the life of a &s;lave without being account|able for his actions. The laws formerly were very loo&s;e on this &s;ubject, and murder of this kind has been committed&mdash;and &s;o it has in ENGLAND&mdash;with impunity. There was always however a heavy fine for this crime, and in aggravated ca&s;es the puni&s;hment was never le&s;s than death; and what is this but our di&s;tinction of man&s;laughter and murder? The&s;e laws however, be|fore MANCHESTER &s;aid a word on the &s;ubject, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to render more rigid, and JAMAICA has already determined to make this crime death without benefit of clergy;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An act to this effect has &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> but even if the&s;e laws did not exi&s;t, there is an unfeeling cruelty beyond de&s;cription in a man's coolly &s;itting down and &s;uppo&s;ing that his fellow creatures&mdash;his countrymen&mdash;can depart from tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations by which alone they de&s;erve to be linked to &s;ociety, and deliberately commit murder, to their manife&s;t di&s;advantage, in the moment a poor wretch needs mo&s;t his pity and compa&s;&s;ion, merely becau&s;e that wretch is in his power. No animal in the circuit of creation ever took a life, but to gratify hunger or &s;atiate revenge. To the latter ignoble propen&s;ity man mo&s;t a&s;&s;u|redly is too much addicted&mdash;but not more in the WEST-INDIES than in ENG|LAND, or any other part of the world; nor indeed are Engli&s;hmen more re|markable for this &s;avage brutality than the inhabitants of any other nation; why then, in a moment of forward and unnece&s;&s;ary zeal, &s;ingle out the Eng|li&s;h We&s;t India planters, in particular, as the perpetrators of unprovoked and u&s;ele&s;s barbarity?&mdash;which, were they capable of, they would de&s;erve to be &s;wept from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>That nothing can prove &s;o decidedly the &s;uperficial and fallacious princi|ples upon which the inhabitants of MANCHESTER ground their arguments, as their a&s;&s;ertion that the GUINEA trade is the de&s;truction of &s;ome of our brave&s;t &s;eaman. It is well known that when king's &s;hips are paid off, unhappy &s;ailors, who have &s;o nobly maintained during a war the glorious naval &s;upe|riority of Engli&s;hmen, take to bad cour&s;es for want of employ, and that the
<PB N="231" REF="238">
gallows groans with tho&s;e neglected objects of bravery, who perhaps, a few months before, were the dread of their enemies. Is it wonderful then, that tho&s;e who have the re&s;olution to with&s;tand the temptations which &s;educed their companions, &s;hould leave their country&mdash;which they mu&s;t do or &s;tarve&mdash;upon <HI>any terms?</HI> But this object is &s;carcely worth contending for:&mdash;the &s;ailors who man the Guineamen are very few of them of this de&s;cription&mdash;they are mo&s;tly &s;uch wretches as, having e&s;caped ju&s;tice in this country, are obliged to fly; for it may be fairly averred, that the ve&s;&s;els bound to AFRICA, by taking &s;uch pe&s;ts of &s;ociety with them, go more to the prevention of de|predations on the public than all the watchfulne&s;s of the Engli&s;h police. To &s;ay the truth, the&s;e ought mo&s;t to be terrified at the chains in which they are &s;ure to be manacled, whenever they treat the &s;laves with cruelty.</P>
<P>That if the a&s;&s;ertion be founded&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it would be rather a benefit than a di&s;advantage to aboli&s;h the &s;lave trade, becau&s;e we might then have re|turns for our commodities in articles the produce of AFRICA,"</Q> it contra|dicts that which went before; for, in this ca&s;e, would not the &s;ailors be as likely to find a grave upon that coa&s;t in any common <HI>trading voyage</HI> as by <HI>bartering for &s;laves?</HI> Be&s;ides, this holds out a &s;ort of argument that the di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s of MANCHESTER is not quite &s;o clear as upon the fir&s;t blu&s;h it appeared; for if a mutual commerce of produce for produce could be brought about, the MANCHESTER goods might in that ca&s;e, not only be &s;old in as large quantities, but probably to much greater advantage. But, after all, what is the value of the produce of AFRICA? What of con&s;equence have we ever done even with SENEGAL? If we could <HI>colonize</HI> indeed!&mdash;but then, would not the death of the emigrants be an improvement on the cruelty which it is &s;aid has &s;timulated us to carry &s;o many &s;ailors to their graves in that unwhole|&s;ome country?</P>
<P>That a total abolition of the &s;lave trade would &s;hake the very exi&s;tence of our WEST-INDIA po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; for there cannot be a fal&s;er argument than that
<PB N="232" REF="239">
a &s;tock of &s;laves is to be kept up without a con&s;tant &s;upply from AFRICA; and as to the vi&s;ionary notion of putting them on a footing with hired &s;ervants, 'tis too ridiculous to de&s;erve a thought. In &s;hort, were the &s;lave trade put an end to, the French, and others, who at pre&s;ent participate with us upon an equal footing the advantages ari&s;ing from the produce of the Caribbee I&s;lands, would then come at their produce upon better terms, and in greater abun|dance; and thus would one exertion of humanity, perfectly laudable in private &s;peculation, in its public operation, train with it the mo&s;t pernicious and de|&s;tructive con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments have branched into a multitude of others, to which MANCHESTER has <HI>replied,</HI> and LIVERPOOL <HI>rejoined</HI>&mdash;the material points how|ever are contained in what I have already &s;et down; but this controver&s;y has drawn from LIVERPOOL a que&s;tion of certainly much greater magnitude than the &s;lave trade&mdash;and it is this: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were it not wi&s;er, and even more humane, before we carry our clemency to AFRICA, to exert it a little for the relief of that oppre&s;&s;ion under which our fellow &s;ubjects groan <HI>at home?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Some of their ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject, which are very pointed, &s;hall make up a part of the next letter&mdash;this I fini&s;h without any farther comment, &s;ince this important &s;ubject is a pending one, and will no doubt undergo a full and &s;atisfactory inve&s;tigation. Then to &s;ay that, at any rate, the exertions of MANCHESTER are prai&s;eworthy, and if their prayer had gone no further than to a correction of abu&s;es, not one word would or could have been &s;aid again&s;t it; for in that ca&s;e, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their demand would have been as evident as that I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;peak to the grievances which exi&s;t at home, and are &s;aid by LIVERPOOL to have thrown &s;uch a &s;hadow over the pre&s;ent <HI>&s;oi di&s;ant</HI> philanthropic exertions, as almo&s;t totally to eclip&s;e them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are comprehended in a general abu&s;e and wilful perver&s;ion of the &s;pirit of our laws. Hence all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to harmle&s;s and indu&s;trious families, by kidnapping and pre&s;&s;ing for the army and navy, through which de&s;erted wives and children are committed to the care of mercile&s;s over&s;eers, and un|thinking boys, in time of peace, flogged to death for de&s;ertion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An in&s;tance of this kind lately occurred, which plainly evinces that if the <HI>laws</HI> of this country are mild, the <HI>execution</HI> of them is cruelly rigourous. In the cour&s;e of la&s;t month, at DOVER, a lad of eighteen was &s;entenced to receive a thou&s;and la&s;hes for de&s;ertion. They had given him five hundred, when&mdash;in terms of the mo&s;t moving &s;upplication&mdash;he implored a re&s;pite of the remainder of his &s;en|tence, crying out, in accents &s;carcely utterable, through the violence of his agony, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that his heart was breaking, and he &s;hould die under it if they flogged him any longer!"</Q>&mdash;regardle&s;s however of his en|treaties, they continued their unmerciful work, till at the end of &s;ix hundred and fifty la&s;hes&mdash;perceiv|ing him actually dying&mdash;they removed him to the guard-hou&s;e, where he expired the next morning! Query, whether this is not at lea&s;t a march for any cruelty that has been practi&s;ed in the WEST-IN|DIES? There is certainly great opportunity for abu&s;es to creep into martial laws, and it originates from this: Tho&s;e who are mo&s;t likely to commit crimes, cannot be tried by their peers. Thus private &s;oldiers and forema&s;t men are generally puni&s;hed with rigour, and the <HI>crimes</HI> of officers too often palli|ated and &s;oftened into <HI>errors.</HI> My brother a&s;&s;ured me the following is a fact. A &s;trange, eccentric fel|low, who was a cook's mate on board a man of war, among other &s;ingularities, u&s;ed to amu&s;e the &s;ailors with tricks on the cards, cups and balls, and other feats of <HI>legerdemain.</HI> The captain&mdash;who was not ble&s;t with a very brilliant under&s;tanding&mdash;in&s;tead of &s;eeing this matter in the harmle&s;s light it de&s;erved, found in his idea &s;omething very reprehen&s;ible in it. The &s;ailor was ordered into his pre|&s;ence, and told that he had heard &s;trange things of him. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Have you indeed, your honour,'</Q> &s;aid JACK, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what are they &s;ir, if I may be &s;o bold?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> &s;aid the captain, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they &s;ay you are a <HI>conjuror.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lord ble&s;s your honour,'</Q> an&s;wered the tar, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'why then, if that's the ca&s;e, they &s;ays &s;trange things of your honour.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of me, you ra&s;cal, why what, you impudent dog, do they &s;ay of me?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why they &s;ays, and plea&s;e your honour, as how your honour is <HI>no conjuror.</HI>'</Q> This, tho' there was no offence in it from the heart, ought to have procured the &s;ailor at lea&s;t a reprimand, if not a &s;light puni&s;hment&mdash;for certainly the barrier of &s;ubordination ought never to be overleaped. The captain however determined upon a more complete revenge than was then in his power, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a &s;mile&mdash;but, from that moment, privately &s;et him down in his black book. No effectual oppor|tunity occurred to gratify this &s;mothered revenge, till the &s;ailor having got drunk a&s;hore neglected to return at the appointed time with his companions. This being the moment the captain wi&s;hed for, poor JACK was tried for de&s;ertion, and &s;entenced to be <HI>keel hauled.</HI> When he was brought forward to &s;uffer his &s;entence, he begged leave to &s;peak to the captain&mdash;to whom he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am &s;entenced, your honour, to undergo a very heavy puni&s;hment, though I have done nothing to de&s;erve it; but I have been tried by a court martial of <HI>captains</HI>&mdash;had I been an officer, my tricks upon the cards would have been a <HI>genteel amu&s;ement,</HI> my <HI>crimes</HI> all <HI>errors,</HI> and my <HI>&s;laying a&s;hore</HI> a <HI>frolic.</HI> God ble&s;s you &s;ir, and all the harm I wi&s;h you is, that for the next crime your honour commits, you may be tried by a court martial of <HI>forema&s;t men</HI>&mdash;and now for DAVY JONES's <HI>locker!</HI>'</Q> Saying which words, he jumped over|board.</NOTE> Hence all

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER expedient, however wi&s;e, however &s;alutary may be the <HI>political</HI> JUSTICE of the laws re&s;pecting debtor and credi|tor in this country, nothing can teem with more <HI>moral</HI> INFAMY than their execution. A deten&s;ion of the per&s;on has been thought, by every wi&s;e man, to be oppre&s;&s;ive, and even impolitic; but I will not go upon that, the laws <HI>war|rant,</HI> or at lea&s;t <HI>tolerate</HI> it, and I &s;hall hardly betray &s;o much folly as to offer a &s;entiment on what will never be effected till law lords cea&s;e to dictate on &s;ub|jects that wholly apply to their own intere&s;t, though the very &s;ame plea is at all times &s;ufficient to render the te&s;timony of a witne&s;s inadmi&s;&s;ible in the courts.</P>
<P>Any man who will make oath to a debt of ten pounds, may arre&s;t ano|ther, and if he cannot give bail to the action, put him in jail. It is not nece&s;|&s;ary that there be &s;uch debt in actual exi&s;tence; for if any accounts have pa&s;&s;ed between the two per&s;ons, and there &s;hould be only a balance of twenty &s;hil|lings, an oath may be <HI>legally</HI> made of the <HI>whole,</HI> let the amount be ever &s;o large, and when the debtor is once in jail, it will take <HI>five terms</HI> to bring the matter to a final i&s;&s;ue, provided the creditor chu&s;e &s;o long to procra&s;tinate the
<PB N="238" REF="245">
di&s;pute. Thus a man who only owes <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> may, in this country, be impri&s;oned a year and a quarter, lo&s;e his time and reputation, pay fifty pounds for law, and emancipate from his confinement a beggar&mdash;whereas common rea&s;on &s;ays, that the creditor ought to have been compelled in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to &s;tate the account fairly, and receive his due, without having it in his power to indulge an indignant and implacable revenge, from which motive alone could &s;pring a wi&s;h to harra&s;s a fellow-creature, for the plea&s;ure of contemplating his &s;ufferings. But it will be a&s;ked whether creditors in ge|neral are &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily oppre&s;&s;ive; and if they are, what can induce them to it? My an&s;wer is, there are three times the number of attornies that can hone&s;tly get employ in this kingdom. From this it ari&s;es, that when one of them is con&s;ulted, in&s;tead of <HI>healing</HI> a breach&mdash;which is his duty&mdash;he makes it <HI>wider</HI>; for indeed he mu&s;t do &s;o, or &s;tarve. Vengeance is always advi&s;ed in&s;tead of compa&s;&s;ion, and this mu&s;t be gone about in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive way po&s;&s;ible, that they may more completely hamper the poor devil who has the misfortune to come under their hands. The action commenced&mdash;the next object is to &s;erve it in as di&s;graceful and inconvenient a manner as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;for lawyers as naturally &s;tudy the intere&s;t of bailiffs as phy&s;icians do that of the apothecaries. By this means, they look out for red letter days, and &s;uch other adventitious means as may put it as much as po&s;&s;ible out of the power of the poor debtor to e&s;cape, till&mdash;to u&s;e their own words&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every man has had a leg or a wing."</Q> To explain my&s;elf. We will &s;uppo&s;e Saturday and Monday red letter days&mdash;the defendant, in this ca&s;e, is always arre&s;ted on a Friday&mdash;but not before &s;ix o'clock in the evening. Thus, though he be pre|pared to give bail or pay the money, he cannot be relea&s;ed till the following Tue&s;day&mdash;becau&s;e the intervention of the two holidays and the Sunday, pre|clude all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;earching the office, though at the moment of the cap|tion fifty to one but they know that there is nothing el&s;e again&s;t him. Dur|ing the four days he is in cu&s;tody, to a certainty every art is u&s;ed&mdash;nine times out of ten by the attorney, but always by the bailiffs&mdash;to induce other credi|tors to lay detainers again&s;t him. At length, after accumulated di&s;grace, mor|tification,
<PB N="239" REF="246">
and expence, by &s;igning notes, cognovits, and warrants of attor|ney, he purcha&s;es a temporary liberty, at an immoderate di&s;advantage&mdash;and after finding it impo&s;&s;ible to fulfil the&s;e engagements &s;o extorted, he goes to pri&s;on for life, at the will of the creditor. If he be advi&s;ed to re&s;ign him&s;elf to exonerate his bail, he is told that if his creditors do not proceed in &s;uch a number of terms, he can get a complete relea&s;e from their power, by &s;uper|&s;eding their actions. This advice taken, and a relea&s;e obtained, after a tedious impri&s;onment, he is ju&s;t where he &s;et out, and may be &s;ued again on every debt for which he was impri&s;oned, which is &s;ure to happen, if he have any thing to pay the co&s;ts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the creditor go on to execution, the pri&s;oner is certainly locked up for life; and the in&s;tances of di&s;ea&s;e, famine, and &s;uicide in con&s;equence (which are apparent in more than that of JOHN SMITH and his wife, who cut their children's throats and hung them&s;elves) prove pretty &s;trongly that in this country a creditor may have a virtual power over the life of a debtor, in which ca&s;e I do not &s;ee why he &s;hould not be like SHYLOCK, not only obliged to relinqui&s;h his demand, but forfeit a part of his own property for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate. Then in vain might he retort, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nay, take my life,"</Q> and all he would be an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How &s;halt thou hope for mercy, rendering none!"</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>At the time LORD EFFINGHAM&mdash;with a benevolence that will reflect on him la&s;ting honour&mdash;ineffectually, owing to the interference of the law lords, attempted a reform on this &s;ubject, he gathered together many well atte&s;ted ca&s;es to &s;trengthen his arguments, and prefaced them by &s;aying that every ca&s;e was a deep tragedy&mdash;more were in preparation for him, and one of them I know to be truth. It was this. A man in the year eighty-three, was five hundred pounds in debt. An attorney, a partner, and a bailiff, by fal&s;e re|ports, brought all his real creditors again&s;t him, and added fictitious ones, till having been in pri&s;on two years, he obtained a relea&s;e upon &s;uper&s;edea&s;es from debts, for which he could again be &s;ued, and having paid upwards of &s;ix hundred pounds <HI>for law,</HI> he found him&s;elf between &s;even and eight hundred pounds in debt, though in the interim he had not contracted a &s;ingle new one. One of the&s;e fictitious debts is worth notice. This man was arre&s;ted for a
<PB N="240" REF="247">
debt he <HI>did not owe.</HI> The account on which it was pretended to ari&s;e having long before been liquidated&mdash;he went to trial, and obtained a verdict in his fa|vour, the plaintiff, when an execution came to be &s;ued out for the co&s;ts, was in pri&s;on. The defendant, therefore, was obliged to pay his own co&s;ts in this unju&s;t action, which amounted to &s;eventeen pounds. In &s;hort, when a man delivers him&s;elf implicitly into the hands of an attorney, there is no advantage that may not be taken of him, and with &s;afety, for let the attorney undertake what he plea&s;es, the client is obliged to acquie&s;ce; and for God &s;ake what man of common, plain under&s;tanding, unacquainted with all the different and equivocating con&s;tructions of the law, can guard again&s;t the con&s;equences that are &s;ure to attend even a winning <HI>cau&s;e</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A plain, well-intentioned farmer, who appeared to be ble&s;t with &s;trong intellectual faculties, once &s;et this matter very clear in the court of King's Bench.

In the cour&s;e of the trial, LORD MANSFIELD having taken notice of &s;ome &s;trong pointed ob&s;ervations, which had fallen from the farmer above mentioned, he begged leave to a&s;k him a few que&s;tions, merely for information, concerning the cu&s;toms of over&s;eers, and other officers, who manage the pari&s;h money.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM MANCHESTER I returned to SHEFFIELD, where, on the following week, this TOUR was put to pre&s;s&mdash;the dates of the letters will &s;hew how much of it was at that time written. Having in&s;pected the fir&s;t &s;ixty-four pages, which&mdash;except one or two half &s;heets&mdash;is all I have had opportunity to examine, I went to LEEDS; where, with the advantage of LADY MEXBOROUGH's name, I had a very good night at the a&s;&s;embly-room, on Monday February the eleventh. My friend WARBURTON al&s;o acquainted me it was very much the wi&s;h of Mr. FAWKES that I might have another night at YORK. This, I confe&s;s, I had no great reli&s;h for; but knowing well the powerful influence of Mr. FAWKES, and how much the inhabitants of that dull region are obliged to the ta&s;te and fa&s;hionable elegance of Mrs. FAWKES, for teaching them how to di&s;tingui&s;h what ought to amu&s;e them, and &s;et them examples of poli&s;hed manners and fini&s;hed good breeding, I did my&s;elf the honour to call on that gentleman, who a&s;&s;uring me his utmo&s;t in|tere&s;t &s;hould be u&s;ed to make a night worth my while, it was fixed for Thur&s;|day February the twenty-eighth; and in the interim, I went on to DURHAM and NEWCASTLE. Pa&s;&s;ing DURHAM, I arrived at NEWCASTLE on Friday the fifteenth; and the next day, after delivering a recommendatory letter to a gentleman of &s;ome con&s;equence, who, like the Iri&s;hman at BATH, promi&s;ed
<PB N="243" REF="250">
GREAT THINGS and did <HI>nothing,</HI> I waited on the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and began my attack in form. I performed four times with very nearly as bad &s;ucce&s;s as at MANCHESTER. The kind way, however, in which Mr. HODGSON, the printer, te&s;tified his concern for what he was plea&s;ed to think want of ta&s;te in the people of NEWCASTLE was truly flattering and obliging. He put a para|graph in his new&s;paper to induce a better attendance, and he was indefatigable in promoting the &s;ub&s;cription. I here thank him for his hand&s;ome and gen|tlemanly treatment of me.</P>
<P>I had trifled away ten days at NEWCASTLE, when I was determined to repa&s;s DURHAM, and get on to YORK. For this purpo&s;e I &s;et-out on Sunday the twenty-fourth, but the weather being remarkably di&s;agreeable, I went no farther than DURHAM that night; and, having &s;een Mr. EBDON, the organi&s;t of the Cathedral, who&s;e candid and <HI>untheoretical</HI> &s;entiments greatly plea&s;ed me, I re&s;olved&mdash;as I had to play with my time till the following Thur&s;day&mdash;that I would &s;tay and &s;ee what Monday night would produce. It not only greatly exceeded my expectations, but I was entreated to perform a &s;econd time, which turned out to be nearly as productive as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>During the time I was at DURHAM, I had many kindne&s;&s;es &s;hewn me, which I would more particularly notice but that my TOUR is ha&s;tening to its clo&s;e. Tho&s;e that were public I received from Dr. COOPER&mdash;which has been a fortunate name to me&mdash;Mr. BIRD, Mr. SMITH, and &s;everal others who&s;e names are in the li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers; the private ones, from Mr. EBDON&mdash;for I never acknowledge any thing as kindne&s;s but what is meant as an unaffected intention to plea&s;e and oblige. As to familiarity, unnece&s;&s;ary and ill-a&s;&s;umed con&s;equence, and invitations to dinner, merely to &s;port a &s;ideboard, it never yet had any attractions for me, and therefore, if any per&s;on at DURHAM &s;hould recognize this for the portrait of his conduct, let it be a &s;ecret between him and me&mdash;but let him al&s;o endeavour to per&s;uade him&s;elf that every man who ac|cepts his acquaintance upon tho&s;e terms laughs at him in his &s;leeve.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251">Ma&s;ter HOULT, at the <HI>Red Lion,</HI> &s;eemed anxious to be celebrated in this TOUR. I am willing to tell the truth, which I dare &s;ay is all he de&s;ires. He appeared very anxious to plea&s;e, and undertook to give his &s;i&s;ter at NORTHAL|LERTON a caution how &s;he treated me on my return, as that lady had been &s;o accommodating on my road to DURHAM from YORK, to put me into a damp bed. What the caution was I will not pretend to &s;ay, but certainly &s;he gave me hor&s;es that knocked up between NORTHALLERTON and EASINGWOULD; as to him&s;elf, he &s;aw I had two tolerable nights, and thought, I &s;uppo&s;e, he had a right to his &s;hare of them&mdash;for having left the bargain concerning the room to a &s;ort of eventual deci&s;ion, though there could be no &s;uch virtual con|&s;truction put on it, he adhered to his bond as rigidly as SHYLOCK. I had a part of the TOUR with me, which he read, and I remember appeared charmed with my account of JEMMY WALLIS, at NEWARK. If he conceived he me|rited a &s;imilar panegyric, he will now &s;ee he and I are of different opinions.</P>
<P>On my return to YORK, the bu&s;ine&s;s of Thur&s;day night was &s;o &s;poken of, that I really thought, out of compliment to the lady who had taken &s;o much pains&mdash;and in obliging whom the inhabitants, by the way, would have paid them&s;elves a compliment&mdash;that I &s;hould have found rea&s;on to change my tone. I remember it was &s;ugge&s;ted to me that I &s;hould be obliged to re|write that letter where, &s;peaking of cities, I put YORK in &s;o unfavourable a point of view. Not a bit. The night, though it proved to the cleare&s;t de|mon&s;tration the weight and con&s;equence of Mrs. FAWKES's name, only con|firmed me the &s;tronger in my belief of their general &s;habbine&s;s, for I had not a promi&s;cuous audience, but a <HI>party</HI> of <HI>ninety-nine per&s;ons,</HI> which is an a&s;toni&s;hing number to be brought through one intere&s;t to an a&s;&s;embly-room in the country.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary adventure happened to me at this time. A decent man came into the parlour in which I was &s;itting at the Inn, and after the mo&s;t confu&s;ed, unconnected preface that can be imagined, told me I had been
<PB N="245" REF="252">
innocently the cau&s;e of injuring him with the people of YORK. I begged to know how, and he informed me that his bu&s;ine&s;s in that place was to deliver an entertainment &s;omewhat &s;imilar to mine, but that of cour&s;e he was &s;ilenced by my arrival. He then entered into a de&s;cription of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in mo&s;t pathetic language, calling him&s;elf a ruined clergyman, &s;aying he was driven to the la&s;t de&s;pair, and that he had frequently been on the point of &s;hooting him&s;elf; at length, calling me out of the room, he &s;aid the &s;malle&s;t trifle would be of infinite &s;ervice to him, and entreated I would lend him <HI>half a crown.</HI> This I gave him without he&s;itation, and at his reque&s;t al&s;o a ticket for the performance, and he went his way. When I came to examine his bills, I found them &s;o worded that he might have been mi&s;taken for me. He had followed exactly in my track, and announced nothing more than that the gen|tleman who had &s;ome time before, at &s;uch and &s;uch a town, given his <HI>Read|ings</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> meant to repeat that entertainment; and I afterwards learnt, that at HULL and BEVERLY, he entertained his audience with nothing more than the &s;ame lively picture of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, till they con&s;ented to go home, and leave their money behind them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have mentioned this here, or at all&mdash;e&s;pecially the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>half crown</HI>&mdash;had not Mr. BLANCHARD, the printer&mdash;who is another of my favourites&mdash;come &s;oon after into the room, when upon giving directions for &s;ome bills on the morrow, &s;omething induced him to notice that there was a &s;trange kind of man who had made &s;ome application to him to print bills&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"but,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he made u&s;e of an odd recommendation, for he &s;aid he was in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s."</Q> In &s;hort, li&s;tening to Mr. BLANCHARD's account, I heard every word that had ju&s;t been repeated to me by the ruined clergyman, which ended with the old reque&s;t of the half crown, which was of cour&s;e given to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my recollection an anecdote of Dr. JOHNSON, which has certainly e&s;caped all his biographers, though it be neverthele&s;s truth&mdash;at lea&s;t if I may believe Dr. GOLDSMITH, who told me &s;o on the very day that he &s;aid it happened. GOLDSMITH, and DAVIS, the book&s;eller, called one morning on Dr. JOHNSON, and found him in company of a man, not only very worthle&s;s in his cha|racter, but one who had been forward in abu&s;ing the doctor him&s;elf. They &s;aw him, as this man went away, put &s;omething in his hand&mdash;upon which GOLDSMITH expo&s;tulated with him, &s;aying, no won|der &s;uch vipers got a living when they could be fo&s;tered by the very hand they wounded, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Fie, doctor,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'this man is one of the mo&s;t infamous ra&s;cals that ever exi&s;ted.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have nothing, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid the doctor, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to do with the man's <HI>vices</HI>&mdash;he a&s;ked me for <HI>half a crown,</HI> and I <HI>gave it him.</HI>"</Q></NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. BLANCHARD, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hould have let the half

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING returned to SHEFFIELD, and given di|rections for adverti&s;ing three nights at LIVERPOOL, I repaired thither, and ar|rived on Tue&s;day the fourth of March. As I nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;ed through MANCHESTER, I thought I might as well make &s;ome enquiry concerning the &s;ub&s;cription, which would of cour&s;e &s;et me to rights as to the attention that had been paid me in my ab&s;ence. Finding, as I before repre&s;ented, that not a &s;ingle name had been added to the li&s;t, I thought it would be a folly to &s;ee MANCHESTER any more.</P>
<P>At LIVERPOOL&mdash;the only place in all my <HI>tour</HI> to which I <HI>returned</HI> to any good purpo&s;e&mdash;I had &s;ix hand&s;ome nights, taking the average of them, and it gave me plea&s;ure to announce that I &s;hould fini&s;h my career in that &s;pirited town. My reception was certainly flattering to an exce&s;s&mdash;if I could have dined in ten places at once,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LIVERPOOL is remarkable of cour&s;e for fine turtle. A gentleman who is well known for di&s;|tingui&s;hing the be&s;t mor&s;els, received two cards of invitation, to dinc on a turtle, the &s;ame day, at the &s;ame hour. After balancing for &s;ome time which he &s;hould accept, he determined to dine at both places. To manage this, he waited on the &s;tewards of one fea&s;t, and repre&s;ented what an awkward hour they had cho&s;en for their dinner&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What an ab&s;urdity,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to dine at <HI>three o'clock</HI>; peo|ple who are on bu&s;ine&s;s all the morning will be &s;tarved; be&s;ides, all the world is getting into early hours now."</Q> The &s;tewards, in &s;hort, con&s;ented to have the dinner at <HI>two.</HI> This point gained, he po&s;ted away to the other &s;tewards&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good God,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what could po&s;&s;e&s;s you to appoint your dinner at <HI>three o'clock?</HI>&mdash;we &s;han't have done upon 'Change&mdash;our appetites won't be half up&mdash;be|&s;ides, how unfa&s;hionable!&mdash;all the world is getting into late hours. In &s;hort, when people meet at a fea&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is over, and therefore you &s;hould always have it as late as you can."</Q> Here al&s;o he carried his point.

kindne&s;s of this &s;ort came &s;o thick, that I was obliged to decline all invitations, le&s;t I &s;hould be incapacitated from affording that entertainment for which pur|po&s;e I went among them.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the eleventh, I attended at their concert, and declare that I heard two acts from the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> performed much more re&s;pectably than I could have conceived. Mr. MEREDITH and Mi&s;s HARWOOD are known to have much merit in this &s;tyle of &s;inging. Mr. WILTON's preci&s;ion and care in leading the band cannot be too much prai&s;ed; and Mr. WAINWRIGHT conducted the choru&s;&s;es in a very able and &s;pirited &s;tyle, and al&s;o, in a very delicate way, gave us the &s;econd of HANDEL's concertos. I have already no|ticed how expert the &s;ingers of YORKSHIRE and LANCASHIRE are at choru&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e who performed them the night I &s;peak of at LIVERPOOL, did HAN|DEL as much credit as if they had been drilled by Mr. JOAH BATES, which between &s;even and eight hundred per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent can te&s;tify.</P>
<P>Were I to &s;peak fully of the attention paid me at LIVERPOOL, I &s;hould have nothing el&s;e to &s;ay. As, therefore, tho&s;e who were &s;o forward to plea&s;e and &s;erve me are the lea&s;t con&s;cious of it&mdash;the whole &s;um of their kindne&s;s being no more than the common exerci&s;e of that liberality which &s;o remark|ably characteri&s;es them&mdash;I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with feeling that which I can|not properly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="256">I quitted LIVERPOOL on Friday the fourteenth of March, having the night before exhibited my&s;elf as a public character for the <HI>la&s;t time,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed on through BIRMINGHAM, in my way to BRISTOL, whither I went on pri|vate bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;pent three or four days with my friend BOYTON, and finally, arrived in LONDON on Saturday the twenty-&s;econd.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU already know the nature of my application to Mr. HARRIS, in March, 1787, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the an&s;wer I received. From YORK, in the following October, I &s;ent that gentleman a mu&s;ical farce, telling him that I had a fir&s;t-piece nearly ready, and three other after-pieces, which in a very &s;hort time I could perfect, and al&s;o &s;ome good materials for pantomimes.</P>
<P>I will confe&s;s to you, that I cho&s;e to &s;end the piece I &s;et the lea&s;t &s;tore by fir&s;t&mdash;for I have, unfortunately, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, a &s;ort of <HI>pre-&s;enti|ment,</HI> and my feelings at that time, I am free to declare, did not very much lead me to place any great faith in Mr. HARRIS's &s;incerity. It was however a farce that, as times go, <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> need not have been a&s;hamed of. Mr. HARRIS returned one act of it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was taken from the French, and like Sir JOHN VANBRUGH's <HI>Country Hou&s;e,</HI> therefore it would not do; but that whenever I would &s;end any thing <HI>completed,</HI> that would be of &s;ervice to the theatre, he &s;hould be glad to treat with me; but not for hints, or de|tached mu&s;ic, for that they were crowded with unappropriated mu&s;ic, by
<PB N="251" REF="258">
the <HI>be&s;t compo&s;ers.</HI>"</Q> I wrote him an an&s;wer to his letter, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I &s;hould be glad of <HI>the other act of the farce</HI>&mdash;that I was &s;orry he thought indifferently of it&mdash;that I certainly took partly the idea of it from a French piece, but I had not literally tran&s;lated a &s;ingle &s;peech; nor had I ever read VANBRUGH's <HI>Country Hou&s;e,</HI> therefore it could not be &s;o like either as to make his objection a &s;ub&s;tantial one; for it was very ea&s;y to &s;hew from whence almo&s;t every piece that had appeared for &s;ome years was taken, and one might venture to add, the &s;ame of tho&s;e which would appear for &s;ome years to come. I went on &s;aying, that I hoped he and I &s;hould agree better on what I &s;hould next &s;end. I begged however that he would explain him&s;elf in one point. If he meant by the word <HI>completed,</HI> that he expected me to &s;end mu&s;ic, as well as words, I certainly could not con&s;ent to it, as I thought I ought to be con|&s;idered as perfectly competent to decide on its merits my&s;elf&mdash;that I de&s;ired fairly and honourably to be under&s;tood to mean exactly what I had a&s;&s;erted that I was going to INDIA, and wi&s;hed very much to leave &s;omething behind me, to have my fame remembered&mdash;for which I &s;hould never &s;tand candidate again. I &s;aid, that when I wrote to him, &s;ome years ago, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, he thought that <HI>hints,</HI> or <HI>any thing el&s;e</HI> from ME, would be valuable to him, and that I really did not believe my rivals had &s;ince given him rea|&s;on to alter his opinion. I had a variety of materials which would certainly be u&s;eful, and indeed he mu&s;t think &s;o, otherwi&s;e why <HI>crowd</HI> his theatre with <HI>unappropriated mu&s;ic</HI>&mdash;for I flattered my&s;elf I had no right to be con&s;i|dered as an <HI>inferior</HI> ma&s;ter. In &s;hort, I told him, if he thought I could leave him nothing that would be of advantage to him, it would be a folly for us to have a &s;ingle moment's further trouble on the &s;ubject.'</Q></P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of my letter; to which, at GRANTHAM, five weeks afterwards, I received an an&s;wer, and the &s;econd act of the farce.</P>
<P>Mr. HARRIS &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was &s;orry I had the trouble of &s;ending again for the &s;econd act&mdash;it had been mi&s;laid by an accident."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="259"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He had only to repeat to me, that any work I might &s;end completed, &s;hould be read with attention, and without delay, and if found likely to &s;uc|ceed, he &s;hould readily treat with me for the purcha&s;e of it&mdash;but not for any unappropriated or detached mu&s;ic."</Q></P>
<P>This letter determined me to let nothing out of my hand till I had come at a fair explanation of the word <HI>completed,</HI> and to do this, I once more wrote to Mr. HARRIS, telling him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that till he &s;hould plea&s;e to explain that word matters mu&s;t &s;tand in <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> for that I could not con&s;ent to &s;end mu&s;ic for <HI>in&s;pection.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having received no an&s;wer to this letter, not even when I arrived in LONDON, the fir&s;t thing I did was to take my final leave of Mr. HARRIS, in a letter, a copy of which &s;hall be tran&s;cribed for your peru&s;al, after I have once more &s;ub&s;cribed my&s;elf</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To THOMAS HARRIS, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have waited three months&mdash;which is &s;omething more than good manners allows&mdash;for an an&s;wer to my la&s;t letter; but as that qua|lity makes no part in the <HI>etiquette</HI> of a MANAGER, your &s;ilence excites in me no wonder. It &s;peaks, however, pretty emphatically, and tells me&mdash;which I really did not think in this in&s;tance&mdash;that you have been near a twelve-month laughing at me. In the month of March la&s;t, I wrote to you of|fering to &s;ale &s;uch materials as I had by me or could fini&s;h before I &s;hould quit ENGLAND. You encouraged me, in an&s;wer, to &s;end either panto|mimes, fir&s;t-pieces, or after-pieces, <HI>completed.</HI> Of this indefinite expre&s;&s;ion I have &s;ince repeatedly entreated an explanation, telling you, that if you ex|pected me to &s;end mu&s;ic for in&s;pection, I could not agree to it&mdash;nor would, I believe, any man in his &s;en&s;es advi&s;e me. The only an&s;wer I have re|ceived from you is, a reiteration of the word, without any elucidation of it; and upon my pre&s;&s;ing you, three months ago, for a <HI>final</HI> an&s;wer, you
<PB N="254" REF="261">
think proper to drop all corre&s;pondence with me. I &s;hall therefore take the liberty, in this letter&mdash;which you will be charmed to hear is the la&s;t you will receive from me&mdash;to &s;ay that it is impo&s;&s;ible but you mu&s;t have a pre|determined re&s;olution not to accept any thing of mine.</P>
<P>Had I gone upon the exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word completed, I mu&s;t have &s;ent you models for pantomimes, as well as the &s;tories and the mu&s;ic&mdash;and to what end? To have had my pains requited by a refu&s;al, and hints taken from the materials. Not by you however. I acquit you of any &s;uch idea&mdash;but your people, barren of genius, would have been happy to catch at any thing original. As to mu&s;ic&mdash;I mu&s;t have been mad to have &s;ent any&mdash;that would have been a glorious fea&s;t indeed for your compilers&mdash;&s;till with|out your knowledge; for they would find no difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing it on you for theirs. I once impo&s;ed on you as <HI>completely,</HI> though not &s;o <HI>nefariou&s;ly,</HI> my&s;elf. I certainly, the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on after I returned from FRANCE, took a particular plea&s;ure in implicitly complying with every reque&s;t you made me; and this is, I &s;uppo&s;e, what you meant when, at the end of that &s;ea|&s;on, you &s;aid &s;omething very hand&s;omely in a letter of my <HI>zeal</HI> for the in|tere&s;ts of the THEATRE. During the getting up of the <HI>Touch&s;tone,</HI> you de&s;ired me to remove a tune, and make a new one in its &s;tead. It was my full intention to have been as complai&s;ant in this in&s;tance as the re&s;t, but having an engagement, I forgot it till the next morning. There being no time to get it ready, when I came to the THEATRE, before the rehear&s;al, and in FOULES's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The copi&s;t.</NOTE> room, I made &s;ome trifling alteration in the accompani|ments, and marked the tune to be played a tone higher;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I frequently did this with GARRICK&mdash;for why &s;hould one be dictated to by the ab&s;urd ob&s;erva|tions of men without cars, who give unnece&s;&s;ary trouble to &s;hew their own con&s;equence.</NOTE> as to the melody there was not a note altered, and every body but your&s;elf knew it to be the &s;ame tune. Thus, <HI>their</HI> remarks that it was better&mdash;meaning the alteration&mdash;<HI>your</HI> coinciding with them&mdash;thinking it a new tune&mdash;and <HI>my</HI> acquie&s;cence
<PB N="255" REF="262">
with both, made as good an equivoque as ever Mr. O'KEEFE introduced into any of his pieces.</P>
<P>You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have known that I meant not to have &s;ent you mu&s;ic &s;ubject to in&s;pection, but that you &s;hould take it upon my promi&s;e that it would be original, and the be&s;t I could make. Nay, I particularly marked, that in what I left behind me, I &s;hould look to my profe&s;&s;ional fame in the &s;tricte&s;t manner. Upon this footing, you certainly did not think proper to receive my productions&mdash;otherwi&s;e you would not have trifled with me.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion is, you either think my abilities impaired, or that I have not now &s;o much <HI>zeal</HI> for the intere&s;t of the THEATRE as I had ten years ago.</P>
<P>'Tis evident I cannot now write any thing to plea&s;e you, for you return every thing I &s;end you; whereas, formerly&mdash;and I can &s;hew your own hand writing to prove it&mdash;you admit the merit of &s;ix pieces &s;ent at one time&mdash;all of which it is true had &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;tatement of pieces.</NOTE></P>
<P>Will not the world be apt to think that the decay is rather in your judg|ment than in my abilities? You very well <HI>know,</HI> and I believe have <HI>al|lowed</HI> that I have as little of arrogance, as to my productions, as any man; and yet I cannot but be alive to what I hear every day. It has been my good fortune, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t twelvemonth, to &s;ee the public a lit|tle face to face, and it happens to have been that part of the public which in great mea&s;ure makes up your boxes&mdash;and they a&s;&s;ure me, to an indivi|dual, that I greatly improve both as an author and a compo&s;er; you will, therefore, excu&s;e me, if I rather credit my benefactors than you.</P>

<P>I &s;hould not have written this letter, but have let the whole bu&s;ine&s;s die away&mdash;for it otherwi&s;e had been &s;carcely worth a thought&mdash;had I not been accu&s;ed, by many opulent and re&s;pectable characters, of having in &s;ome way &s;o deported my&s;elf as to have made it impo&s;&s;ible for MANAGERS to treat with me, otherwi&s;e I could not &s;et up as an excu&s;e for going to IN|DIA my having been driven from the THEATRE.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure you will allow that I have fairly &s;tated the matter, and that there is nothing between us but a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of a very common word, which, like TOUCHSTONE's <HI>if,</HI> has &s;o operated as to prevent any thing coming of our negociation; in the cour&s;e of which we have both acted in our &s;ituations: <HI>I</HI> have, as dependants &s;hould, entreated&mdash;and <HI>you</HI> have not deigned to an&s;wer.</P>

<P><PB N="258" REF="265">This matter has thus terminated, and through you I give to the public a &s;trong fact&mdash;which is worth a thou&s;and arguments. As a proof that every man who thinks independently mu&s;t lay his account to having no concern with the THEATRE, Mr. SHERIDAN has the boldne&s;s to &s;ay in <HI>The Critic,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that very few go through the fatigue of thinking for them&s;elves."</Q> If &s;o, we have only to lament that &s;tage manoeuvres are not as <HI>hone&s;t</HI> as they are IN|GENIOUS, and that the fir&s;t dramatic writer of the day holds out fallacy as the principal ingredient in a theatrical compo&s;ition. That he has as little of ori|ginality in the plots of his pieces as Mr. CUMBERLAND&mdash;again&s;t whom he &s;eems to head the whole force of his &s;atire&mdash;is certain. I do not mean howe|ver to accu&s;e him of imbecility&mdash;he has genius equal to any thing; but the generality of Engli&s;h audiences have been &s;o u&s;ed to <HI>cayenne</HI> and <HI>high cookery,</HI> that he knew plain nature would &s;tand no chance among them. He is how|ever the only man who has ventured to impo&s;e upon them, and tell them &s;o in the &s;ame breath; but the Engli&s;h have &s;uch a redundancy of good nature, that if a man arrogates a &s;uperiority, &s;upporting his preten&s;ions at the &s;ame time with any formidable &s;hew of ability, their characteri&s;tic benevolence is at once appealed to, and they implicitly give him credit for the very merit he a&s;&s;sures them he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Few words on Mr. SHERIDAN's dramatic works, and adieu to the <HI>Theatre</HI>&mdash;except &s;uch circum&s;tances relative to it as will ne|ce&s;&s;arily come out in my &s;tatement of pieces.</P>
<P><HI>The Rivals</HI> has had the lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and yet it is the mo&s;t original of all his pieces. It was nearly damned on the fir&s;t night, and Mr. SHERIDAN&mdash;profiting by the experience with which its reception furni&s;hed him&mdash;withdrew it with this remark. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now got the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and it &s;hall be my fault if I don't make the &s;hoe to fit next time."</Q> His labour however being only cobler's work, it required too much of method for his volatile genius to buckle to, and we may venture to pronounce, without any great outrage on probability, that had not Mr. SHERIDAN &s;o much influence in the <HI>theatre, The Rivals</HI> would never have made its appearance a <HI>&s;econd &s;ea&s;on.</HI> It is a neat, well written piece, but has that &s;ort of cold correctne&s;s which will not go to the galleries. The incident, from <HI>The Nut-brown Maid,</HI> though written with great &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy, is no more proper for the <HI>theatre</HI> than the fine &s;trokes of a miniature painter would be in the fini&s;hing of flats and wings.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">All this perhaps inducing Mr. SHERIDAN to think with the chairman in relation to POPE, he produced <HI>The Duenna</HI>&mdash;where there is not a &s;ingle new &s;ituation from beginning to end. The whole plot of turning the daughter out of doors, and pa&s;&s;ing the maid for the mi&s;tre&s;s, is conjointly the <HI>Scicelienne</HI> of MOLIERE and <HI>Il Filo&s;ofo di campagna</HI>&mdash;where every circum&s;tance is to be found, from the &s;erenade at the beginning to the marriage at the end. The other plot is <HI>The Wonder</HI>&mdash;which, the moment it is told, mu&s;t be obvious to every body&mdash;becau&s;e every body knows both pieces. Not even any &s;ingle &s;ubordi|nate circum&s;tance is original. <HI>Father Paul</HI> is MARMONTEL's <HI>Philo&s;ophe &s;oi di&s;ant</HI>&mdash;who, as he eats delicacies, talks of the roots of the earth&mdash;and, as he drinks burgundy, prai&s;es the whole&s;ome chry&s;tal &s;tream. The dialogue is by no means brilliant; but Mr. SHERIDAN was determined it &s;hould penetrate every where, and in particular the <HI>a&s;ide</HI> &s;peeches of <HI>I&s;aac</HI>&mdash;&s;hewing beforehand how clearly he &s;hall him&s;elf be taken in by his different attempts to deceive others, is the mo&s;t artful &s;pecies of anticipation that ever was practi&s;ed, and &s;hews a judgment of theatrical effect powerful, new, and extraordinary.</P>
<P><HI>The School for Scandal</HI> is no more original than <HI>The Duenna.</HI> The <HI>&s;chool</HI> it&s;elf is CONGREVE's <HI>Cabal,</HI> and the play may fairly be called a &s;equel to <HI>The Way of the World.</HI> The &s;candal has all been detailed in different pieces, but principally in <HI>The Plain Dealer.</HI> When in NOVEL, <HI>Lord Plau&s;ible, Olivia,</HI> and <HI>Eliza,</HI> will be found <HI>Sir Benjamin Crab, Lady Sneerwell,</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Can|dour.</HI> The brothers have been in a variety of things, from <HI>The Adelphi</HI> to Mr. CUMBERLAND's <HI>Fa&s;hionable Folly</HI>&mdash;but the <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia</HI> on the &s;tage, and <HI>Blifil</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones</HI> in the clo&s;et, are the clo&s;e&s;t re&s;emblances. The uncle lately returned from abroad, and introduced to the drunken company, is ex|tremely like the <HI>The Intriguing Chambermaid.</HI> The circum&s;tance of the uncle's picture is in a French piece called <HI>L'ecole de la Jeune&s;&s;e</HI>; and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Lady Teazle</HI>&mdash;are <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Lady Brute.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="268">Mr. SHERIDAN has &s;aid that there is not a new character or incident&mdash;and all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel appearance. Had he &s;aid that it is &s;afer to do &s;o, I would join with him; for certainly when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been before familiar, or rather congenial to it, without con&s;ideration, we give credit for its merit on the &s;pot, whatever we may do upon reflection&mdash;and having once prai&s;ed a thing, a fal&s;e pride prevents us from di&s;covering that we were de|ceived. The dialogue of this piece is as accommodating as the re&s;t of it. Mr. HERON points out the tin&s;el &s;cattered up and down by way of &s;entiments, which, by the theatrical people, are known by the name of <HI>clap traps</HI>; and Mr. SHERIDAN cannot take it ami&s;s, if in ju&s;tice to his abilities and our own di&s;cernment, one is obliged to &s;ay, that he can&mdash;whenever he plea&s;es, write ten times better.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monody,</HI> which &s;eems written expre&s;&s;ly to de&s;ire all the world to <HI>forget</HI> GARRICK, has again very little of originality in it. LLOYD's <HI>Actor</HI> furni&s;hed the outline, in addition to which Mr. SHERIDAN certainly has touched in &s;ome beautiful &s;trokes; but, after all, it is but a &s;ketch, and much more likely to be forgotten than him who&s;e memory it laboriou&s;ly profe&s;&s;es to prove ought to be buried with his a&s;hes. My great quarrel with Mr. SHERIDAN in this bu&s;ine&s;s is, that he has with great &s;kill and ability &s;poken of all the arts, except <HI>mu&s;ic.</HI> He has &s;hewn that the &s;ame of the &s;tatuary is mo&s;t perfect when the &s;tatues them&s;elves are broken to pieces&mdash;that RAPHAEL and SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS are cotemporaries,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I once &s;aw, at Blenheim-hou&s;e, what would make this line pa&s;s for &s;atire. It was a portrait of the DUCHESS OF MALBOROUGH and her CHILD, in which the colours were all flown, by the &s;ide of the VIRGIN and our SAVIOUR, by RAPHAEL, in which the tints were in as high pre&s;ervation as if it had not been painted &s;ix months.</NOTE> and that the&s;e arts are &s;ubordinate to <HI>poetry</HI>; but he has not once even hinted that there is any &s;uch &s;tudy as mu&s;ic&mdash;to which, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, none of the arts are &s;uperior. I beg to a&s;k Mr. SHE|RIDAN a que&s;tion. Does he believe if&mdash;added to his own con&s;ummate know|ledge of &s;tage effect&mdash;he could borrow the pen of SHAKESPEARE, and by
<PB N="261" REF="269" MS="y">
blending &s;uch talents, form a play beyond all conception the mo&s;t perfect: that ever graced a theatre, that the audience would not&mdash;&s;pite of their anxious &s;u&s;|pence&mdash;&s;pite of their brui&s;ed hides in crowding to the hou&s;e&mdash;hi&s;s down the curtain, if they were deprived of the fir&s;t mu&s;ic. But indeed whatever may be the con&s;cious haughtine&s;s with which this gentleman may think proper to look down on an art, to which I hope he owes no grudge, he had good &s;en&s;e enough to court its alliance before he thought proper to put his <HI>dramatic</HI> fame to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> trial.</P>
<P><HI>The Critic</HI> is &s;urely nothing equal, as a &s;atire, to <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>&mdash;and when we talk of <HI>The Rehear&s;al,</HI> it &s;inks to nothing. FIELDING and BUCKINGHAM have taken in the whole round of tragedy, and properly conceived that DRY|DEN, LEE, and the old &s;tandards, were fair game. What has Mr. SHERI|DAN done? Why truly, except indeed where he chu&s;es to ridicule SHAKES|PEARE&mdash;which, by the bye, I do not think an Engli&s;h audience would have &s;uffered in any body el&s;e&mdash;he has expo&s;ed the puerile, modern &s;tuff, which if it be deficient in merit, he&mdash;as a manager&mdash;mu&s;t bear his &s;hare of reprehen&s;ion for obtruding it on the public. The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Sir Plagiary</HI> is &s;evere enough; but, unfortunately, the very words he intends &s;hould give the deepe&s;t wound, recoils on him&s;elf&mdash;for they are a <HI>plagiary. Puff,</HI> is full of pointed ob&s;erva|tion, but that part of the piece is the fir&s;t in&s;tance&mdash;as I before ob&s;erved&mdash;where an audience have quietly &s;at down and con&s;ented to be laughed at by an author. As to the drift of the piece, it appears to be written with a view alone to di&s;|courage writers of tragedy; for there is no po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation that can excite pi|ty, terror, or any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tragedy pecu|liarly to call forth, but this work, which <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"profe&s;&s;es to be critical,"</Q> attempts to laugh at&mdash;and really not always with &s;ucce&s;s; for, if figure and imagery may at all be introduced in this &s;pecies of writing, the critici&s;m it&s;elf is more an object of ridicule than the thing it profe&s;&s;es to critici&s;e. In &s;hort, I defy Mr. SHERIDAN him&s;elf to write a tragedy &s;o as to &s;teer clear of his own la&s;h; and how ab&s;urd mu&s;t a man appear who provides a ca&s;tigation for him&s;elf!
<PB N="263" REF="270">
The matter relative to the clock, at the beginning of <HI>The Duenna,</HI> &s;hews evi|dently that he is vulnerable, as well as his neighbours; and as the circum|&s;tance goes to a reprobation of the unities, it were as mode&s;t to propo&s;e &s;ome better criterion before he invited us to explode the admitted &s;tandard: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but one man may &s;teal a hor&s;e better than another look over the hedge,"</Q> &s;ays the old proverb. Mr. SHERIDAN can write in any &s;tyle, and to any degree of perfection he plea&s;es, but his public writing, like his public &s;peaking, is more <HI>catching</HI> than CAPTIVATING; it <HI>dazzles,</HI> but does not IMPRESS&mdash;it <HI>charms,</HI> but does not CONVINCE. In &s;hort, as that gentleman's aim is popu|larity, he does every thing for the moment, and it is a que&s;tion, after he has &s;unk into ea&s;e and independance, from his natural indolence of mind, whether he will ever again be known but by a few eminent trifles written to grace the private cabinet, and make up the <HI>delices</HI> of the elegant and euridite.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN having mo&s;t probably done with the &s;tage, as an author, it is but fair to examine how far, in that capacity, he has been an acqui&s;ition to the public; and when we con&s;ider that he has deprived the world of the be&s;t &s;inger, beyond all compari&s;on, that we have ever heard, it is very doubt|ful whether what he has given be adequate to what he has taken away&mdash;and, admitting this, the public would rather have gained than lo&s;t had Mr. SHE|RIDAN originally kept to politics, and have had nothing to do with the theatre.</P>
<P>This gentleman, from his earlie&s;t youth, re&s;olved to be at the top of his profe&s;&s;ion, be it what it might. May his integrity equal his abilities, and there is no &s;ituation but he will adorn!</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING in LONDON the mu&s;ical world up in arms at what they had heard concerning this book, I cannot re&s;ume the &s;ubject better than by taking them while they are warm. I am only &s;orry the &s;mall re|maining portion of room which I can dedicate to this &s;ubject will prevent me from going into it &s;o fully as I could wi&s;h&mdash;for it is prolific, and cannot, for the &s;ake of the public, be too clo&s;ely in&s;pected.</P>
<P>I have advanced that PURCEL had a <HI>&s;tronger mind</HI> than HANDEL, and that had ARNE been encouraged, he would have been a greater man. At the time PURCEL lived, mu&s;ic was in its infancy in this kingdom, and all the perfection compo&s;ers had an idea of, was to &s;hackle them&s;elves with rules, and thus they dared not give way to the brilliancy of their genius&mdash;for there was as much good &s;en&s;e in this practi&s;e as there would be in tying a man's legs to make him run the fa&s;ter&mdash;but where, in &s;pite of dull cu&s;tom, the ima|gination of PURCEL beamed forth. It had a maje&s;ty and a re&s;ulgence, like the &s;un breaking from a cloud. How beautiful is that heavenly bit, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I call you all to WODEN's hall!"</Q> What a bar or two will be found in, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let not a moon-born elf!"</Q> Can any thing, for exqui&s;ite &s;implicity and &s;weet|ne&s;s,
<PB N="265" REF="272">
exceed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lovely i&s;le?"</Q> Nor will I go out of this very piece to prove my po&s;ition relative to HANDEL. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, if you dare, the trumpet &s;ounds,"</Q> gives me a fine opportunity to throw down my gauntlet, and I challenge all the world to &s;hew me any thing in mu&s;ic that can go beyond it. HANDEL had a glorious opportunity, had it been po&s;&s;ible; but, in his attempt to excel it, he has fallen to an immen&s;e di&s;tance indeed. The words for both are written by DRYDEN, and tho&s;e which HANDEL &s;et, for grandeur, has the pre-emi|nence: one runs
<Q><L>"Come&mdash;if you dare&mdash;the trumpet &s;ounds,</L>
<L>"Come&mdash;if you dare&mdash;the foe rebounds;</L>
<L>"We come, we come, we come,</L>
<L>"Says the double, double beat of the thundering drum."</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot correctly remember the remainder&mdash;but this will be enough for my purpo&s;e: the other words are,
<Q><L>"The trumpet's loud clangour</L>
<L>"Excites us to arms,</L>
<L>"With &s;hrill notes of anger</L>
<L>"And mortal alarms;</L>
<L>"The double, double, double beat</L>
<L>"Of the thund'ring drum</L>
<L>"Cries, hark! the foes come;</L>
<L>"Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat."</L></Q></P>
<P>PURCEL's expre&s;&s;ion, is one great, &s;oul-felt effu&s;ion of &s;imple &s;ublimity; and as it ever will be the ca&s;e with great minds, at the &s;ame time that the&s;e few bold notes carry us to the rough manners of the court of King ARTHUR, there is a natural ea&s;e and irre&s;i&s;table grace in them that will vainly be imitated by all the &s;tudied poli&s;h of the Italian &s;chool; and indeed &s;o &s;trongly from ge|nius did PURCEL po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;ymmetry in fancy, which&mdash;like the native dig|nity of &s;ome forms&mdash;cannot in any po&s;ition be ungraceful, that the very error Dr. BURNEY reprobates in HANDEL&mdash;which he qualifies, by the bye, &s;aying that it was not reformed till <HI>lately</HI>&mdash;is here in PURCEL, who lived in ruder
<PB N="266" REF="273">
times, better than <HI>corrected</HI>&mdash;it is <HI>avoided</HI>; for his great conception&mdash;while others <HI>labour</HI> to improve <HI>nature</HI> into <HI>ea&s;e</HI>&mdash;derived <HI>ea&s;e</HI> from <HI>nature.</HI> What I allude to is, the accommodating the melody of the capacity of the trumpets&mdash;which HANDEL &s;carcely ever does&mdash;and &s;urely there is &s;omething like barren|ne&s;s of invention in this. But to examine what HANDEL has done with the other words&mdash;and here I am afraid integrity obliges us to &s;ay he has &s;ervilely imitated PURCEL. I &s;ay &s;ervilely, becau&s;e the time and the con&s;truction is the &s;ame, but&mdash;like a clum&s;y tran&s;lation&mdash;the literal intention is barely pre|&s;erved, and all the beauty and correctne&s;s left out. Indeed the curious mode of accenting the beginning of every bar&mdash;for it runs thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>trumpets</HI> loud <HI>clangour excites</HI> us to <HI>arms,</HI>"</Q> the <HI>lovely</HI> introduction of the <HI>fourth</HI> for the trumpet, and the lamene&s;s of the double beat of <HI>the</HI> thundering drum&mdash;though thundering happens to be of three &s;yllables, and thus there can be no excu&s;e for it&mdash;&s;hews that though HANDEL came <HI>after</HI> PURCEL&mdash;which is ad|mitted to be an advantage&mdash;it was in &s;uch a <HI>hobbling</HI> kind of way, and he was at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that he never was able to come up to him. The words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Charge, 'tis too late to retreat,"</Q> though they are materially hurt by the continuation of that ba&s;tard kind of minuet which accompanies them through|out, have much of HANDEL's natural grandeur which certainly characterized him, wherever he is helped out by in&s;truments, but which &s;eems perpetually to for&s;ake him when the <HI>voice</HI> &s;hould convey the MIND.</P>
<P>PURCEL&mdash;though probably very uncon&s;cious that he had &s;ucce&s;sfully challenged all the world to excel him&mdash;follows up <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come&mdash;if you dare,"</Q> with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To arms,"</Q> which harmony HANDEL has twenty times played upon, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Britons &s;trike home"</Q>&mdash;and if any man will &s;hew me a &s;uperior &s;elec|tion from any one piece compo&s;ed by HANDEL&mdash;as no man is more open to conviction&mdash;I will confe&s;s that PURCEL and I are conquered.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER is &s;aid to have emulated ACHILLES, and CHARLES XII. ALEXANDER. It has al&s;o been remarked that SPENCER had only the
<PB N="267" REF="274">
ANCIENTS to con&s;ult&mdash;DRYDEN the ANCIENTS and SPENCER&mdash;and POPE all the&s;e&mdash;and that we may by deduction pronounce that SPENCER was the greate&s;t <HI>poet,</HI> DRYDEN the <HI>next,</HI> and POPE the <HI>mo&s;t inferior.</HI> It is certain whatever DRYDEN and POPE have come in contact&mdash;witne&s;s, for example, the <HI>Ode on St. Cecilia's day</HI> and <HI>Alexander's fea&s;t</HI>&mdash;POPE has con&s;tantly been wor&s;ted, and probably all the fancy in DRYDEN's works together bear no pro|portion to the wonderful imagery in the teeming imagination of SPENCER; let me therefore be allowed, when I &s;peak of PURCEL, the time in which he lived, the little information he could have gathered from what went before him, and the many di&s;couragements he laboured under, and I am not afraid but every man who has the candour to take up my arguments upon this liberal ground, will allow me that this wonderful compo&s;er had a <HI>&s;tronger mind</HI> than HANDEL.</P>
<P>My next ta&s;k will be to prove my po&s;ition in relation to ARNE, and this I &s;hall endeavour to do in my next letter. In the mean time, I cannot either introduce <HI>that</HI> or fini&s;h <HI>this</HI> better than by remarking, that when ARNE came to alter the mu&s;ic of King ARTHUR for <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> with that good &s;en&s;e and philanthropy of which no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a larger &s;hare&mdash;though he introduced &s;ome charming things&mdash;&s;o far from mutilating PURCEL, as a modern compiler would have done, with proper reverence for &s;uch great abilities, his whole &s;tudy was to place his idolized predece&s;&s;or in that con&s;picuous &s;ituation, the brilliancy of his reputation demanded; for ARNE&mdash;and I well know it&mdash;had as much of the harmony of <HI>humanity,</HI> as of <HI>&s;ounds.</HI> His latter excellence I am now going to examine.

<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any of the lovers of HANDEL were to open this book exactly at this page, they would think it was written in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and immediately, pitying the poor maniac of an author, &s;hrug up their &s;houlders, and lay it down. As to their opinions, who&s;e minds are &s;hut again&s;t convic|tion, I am perfectly indifferent&mdash;but I will not let them pa&s;s without remark|ing, that tho&s;e who admire one man of genius to the exclu&s;ion of all others, mu&s;t naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch narrow, contracted &s;entiments, that their very blandi&s;hments are tainted with poi&s;on, and de&s;troy that reputation they profe&s;s to cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;tart ARNE again&s;t HANDEL, by &s;aying that HANDEL has not produced a piece &s;o complete, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, as <HI>Comus.</HI> As a man of <HI>genius,</HI> by in|finite degrees, <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI> is HANDEL's be&s;t work; and I will venture to &s;ay, but for that piece, he could not have borne that great rank, notwith|&s;tanding all that has been vaunted of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> among men who know <HI>really</HI> how to di&s;tingui&s;h. <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI> contains a number of beautiful me|lodies; and what li&s;ts it into great con&s;equence is, that the &s;ubject is every
<PB N="269" REF="276">
where <HI>pa&s;toral,</HI> and yet HANDEL has contrived, without injuring it, to make it every where <HI>different.</HI> Even <HI>Polypheme</HI> and the <HI>octave flute</HI> are <HI>con|&s;i&s;tently</HI> coupled together. The famous trio, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The flocks &s;hall leave the mountains,"</Q> is a compo&s;ition replete with &s;weetne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wretched lovers,"</Q> is an a&s;toni&s;hing chorus. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hu&s;h! ye pretty warbling quire,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Love in her eyes,"</Q> are delicately pretty, though if there were not &s;o great a maze of modulation in the latter, it would be more plea&s;ing. In &s;hort, there is prodigious merit in <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> and yet I am not afraid but ARNE can &s;tand fairly up to his competitor. I would not wi&s;h to match my HERO with a <HI>pigmy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Comus</HI> has one character as well as <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI>; and the <HI>bacchana|lian revels</HI> of ARNE is every where <HI>equal</HI> to the <HI>pa&s;toral &s;implicity</HI> of HANDEL, and in many places SUPERIOR. ARNE has diver&s;ified his &s;ubjects, and in a very peculiar way given them a <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> and a <HI>feminine</HI> colouring. Among the fir&s;t are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When Phoebus &s;inketh in the we&s;t,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By the gaily circling gla&s;s,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fly &s;wiftly ye minutes,"</Q> and &s;everal others; and among&s;t the latter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By dimpled brook,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Would you ta&s;te the noontide air,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, bid adieu to fear,"</Q> and many more. Nay, he has contrived to <HI>blend</HI> this colouring in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Live and love, enjoy the fair,"</Q> which is a mo&s;t happy com|po&s;ition indeed, and fairly equal, in its kind, to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The flocks &s;hall leave the mountains."</Q> All the&s;e &s;ongs are full of rich and plea&s;ing melody, and in them there is not a &s;uperfluous note. There ARNE takes the lead of HANDEL&mdash;becau&s;e mu&s;ic does not want alone fancy to <HI>conceive,</HI> but judgment to <HI>com|plete</HI> it; and in many of the &s;ongs of <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Shepherd what art thou pur&s;uing,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Con&s;ider fond &s;hepherd,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cea&s;e to beauty,"</Q> and &s;ome others, the &s;ubject is <HI>worked</HI> on, till the ear can bear it no longer, and the compo&s;er &s;eeming to be aware of this la&s;&s;itude, takes his advantage of it, and comes any how to a clo&s;e while the &s;tupor prevails, that &s;o the hearer may not with preci&s;ion judge of his de&s;ects.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="277">So far, <HI>Comus</HI> is at lea&s;t upon a par with <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> and when we call in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor on beds,"</Q> that heavenly melody, &s;o greatly conceived, &s;o delicately pur&s;ued, and &s;o exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On every hill,"</Q> which is a &s;pecies of pa&s;toral mu&s;ic peculiar to ARNE, and being in a minor key, and con&s;equently of a more primitive nature, e&s;pecially as its &s;implicity appeals wonderfully to the heart, may be &s;aid to be &s;uperior to any other. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sweet echo,"</Q> which <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"takes the rapt &s;oul and laps it in ely&s;ium,"</Q> and many of inferior kind, &s;uch as that pretty &s;ong, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By the ru&s;hy, fringed bank,"</Q> there can be no doubt but <HI>Comus</HI> is a greater effort of genius than <HI>Acis and Galatea.</HI></P>
<P>But there are more complete pieces to a&s;&s;i&s;t this argument. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> is a mo&s;t powerful performance&mdash;there the <HI>hearer</HI> may be gratified with every &s;tyle of &s;erious mu&s;ic, and yet the whole is managed with &s;uch judgment&mdash;which outgoes Mr. SHERIDAN&mdash;that though perfectly in nature, the <HI>&s;tage boxes</HI> are not more &s;atisfied than the <HI>upper galleries.</HI></P>
<P>If we &s;earch further, we &s;hall find <HI>Judith,</HI> an oratorio, that does honour to Engli&s;h genius&mdash;where we may &s;ee &s;acred ideas, without burle&s;que accom|paniments&mdash;&s;weet air and forcible expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;capital &s;ongs, perfectly <HI>vocal</HI>&mdash;and a&s;toni&s;hingly brilliant <HI>choru&s;&s;es,</HI> without a <HI>fugue.</HI></P>
<P>If we have &s;till to &s;hew&mdash;for I would willingly &s;atisfy every body&mdash;whe|ther ARNE knew mu&s;ic <HI>&s;cientifically,</HI> I'll beg leave to in&s;tance the choru&s;&s;es in <HI>Abel,</HI> which, it mu&s;t be admitted, explore the regions of harmony with a lati|tude as bold and as ma&s;terly as any thing in mu&s;ic. And now I think, if ARNE had been equally patronized with HANDEL; if he had not been obliged to hu|mour managers; to con&s;ult the caprice of actors and actre&s;&s;es; to witne&s;s the arrogance of Italians, who&s;e ba&s;e metal became a fa&s;hion, while his &s;terling coin was di&s;regarded; to do jobs for now and then twenty guineas; and dance attendance at catch clubs to make up an annual benefit, he would have had better rea&s;on to think him&s;elf properly encouraged, and perhaps been &s;timu|lated
<PB N="271" REF="278">
to the accompli&s;hment of various other works, for which his exalted ge|nius &s;o eminently qualified him. This alone has made him apparently inferior to HANDEL, and this induced him to keep within the limits of his mediocre &s;ituation, contenting him&s;elf by the exerci&s;e of his own cheerful and even temper, with that precarious pittance which is too often allotted to real merit in this country.</P>
<P>Certainly ARNE's faults were <HI>few</HI>&mdash;HANDEL's <HI>innumerable</HI>; and when we con&s;ider that HANDEL compo&s;ed when he was in the humour, and to plea&s;e <HI>him&s;elf</HI>&mdash;ARNE when he could get a job, and to plea&s;e his <HI>employer</HI>; that HANDEL was rich, and ARNE was poor&mdash;our wonder ought rather to be, that he left &s;o many and &s;uch admirable compo&s;itions behind him. But DRY|DEN is &s;aid to have been prevented from writing an epic poem by his engage|ment with the theatres, which obliged him to write four plays in a year; and thus are we con&s;tantly deprived of the be&s;t efforts of Engli&s;h genius by lavi&s;h|ing that on foreigners&mdash;who laugh at us&mdash;which is &s;o honourably due to our own countrymen.</P>
<P>My next letter will &s;peak of teaching&mdash;which will be all I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;ay <HI>generally</HI> of mu&s;ic. I am charmed that I have opened your eyes relative to Mr. SHERIDAN. ARNE is a favourite of yours, and therefore this la&s;t ta&s;k has not been &s;o hard. I hope you believe me ju&s;t to every body; is I were not &s;o, I &s;hould not de&s;erve the plea&s;ure with which I &s;ub&s;cribe my|&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Shall now &s;peak of that my&s;tery by which &s;o many young ladies, at a great expence, in the cour&s;e of &s;even years, attain the &s;upreme felicity of expo&s;ing them&s;elves by playing MALBROOK out of tune, and hammering out unmeaning, progre&s;&s;ive le&s;&s;ons, by which the ta&s;te of whole families is vitiated, through the ignorance of mere &s;trummers and octave players, through which the foundation of genius is &s;apped and de|&s;troyed, and through which pretenders to a liberal profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;mere <HI>quacks</HI>&mdash;are lifted into con&s;equence, and permitted to vilify and <HI>traduce</HI> tho&s;e produc|tions they have not the ta&s;te and judgment to <HI>under&s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>teacher</HI> nur&s;es a <HI>&s;cholar</HI> as an <HI>apothecary</HI> does a <HI>patient</HI>; and a <HI>&s;low &s;e|ver</HI> and a <HI>dunce</HI> are much about upon a par: it is not the intention that one &s;hould <HI>recover,</HI> or the other <HI>improve</HI>&mdash;the bu&s;ine&s;s is to keep them in hand as long as po&s;&s;ible; and if a <HI>robu&s;t con&s;titution</HI> in one, and <HI>&s;trong intellects</HI> in the other, manife&s;t &s;igns of <HI>health</HI> or <HI>merit,</HI> 'tis wonderful to what &s;hifts the poor devils are put&mdash;to curb <HI>nature,</HI> in order to &s;well out the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="280" MS="y">Good teachers&mdash;like good lawyers&mdash;are very &s;carce. Tho&s;e who are really good ones, will fir&s;t of all inculcate the principles of mu&s;ic to a certain degree, prove tho&s;e principles in every po&s;&s;ible manner, and &s;trongly root their efficacy in the &s;cholar's mind&mdash;and nothing in nature, to men of real inge|nuity, is ea&s;ier than this.</P>
<P><HI>Bad</HI> teachers &s;warm all over the kingdom, and their practice is to their &s;cholars immediately to the in&s;trument, to explain nothing but as it oc|curs, to make a my&s;tery of every thing, and at length&mdash;&s;ome wilfully, and others out of ignorance&mdash;to confirm in their &s;cholars &s;o many bad habits and perplexities, that they are further from the real mark when they leave off, than when they began.</P>
<P>A third &s;ort of teachers&mdash;who are certainly bad ones too, but not &s;o mi&s;chievous&mdash;are tho&s;e who go about every thing &s;cientifically, and teach <HI>thorough ba&s;s, fugue, and counterpoint,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Foot's minuet.</HI> One of the&s;e had taken a young lady in hand, and taught her, in the cour&s;e of three quar|ters of a year, every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation of the &s;ixth, and fourth, and common chord. Dr. MILLER and <HI>I</HI> had a laugh about this, for we calculated that, taking in all the concords and di&s;cords, with their proper and inverted rela|tions, this young lady might entertain lively hopes, in the cour&s;e of two and thirty years and a half, of accompanying a concerto.</P>
<P>Both &s;orts of <HI>bad</HI> teachers do equal mi&s;chief&mdash;for tho&s;e who wilfully im|po&s;e on parents, decry the works of genius <HI>out of envy,</HI> as much as the other de&s;cription <HI>out of ignorance</HI>; and the con&s;equent evils are, the lo&s;s of time and expence, and the introduction of bad ta&s;te. From this la&s;t abu&s;e &s;prings half the mu&s;ical folly for which this country is &s;o celebrated, which, like Ve&s;uvius, is frequently breaking out, bearing down ta&s;te, genius, and every cultivated object in its way; for whether a human voice an octave above a
<PB N="274" REF="281">
blackbird&mdash;a French-horn that plays every thing but what is natural to it&mdash;a fugue, or an Iri&s;h jig&mdash;a double drum, or a bagpipe&mdash;be the object, this mon&s;ter, this devourer, rages like the <HI>Minotaur,</HI> and ta&s;te is the bleeding &s;a|crifice devoted to appea&s;e his ravages. Alas, that &s;ome mu&s;ical The&s;eus would but de&s;troy this pe&s;t, and rid our country of its barbari&s;m! But a clue to the labyrinth where it is concealed, will hardly be found while there are &s;o many to participate the golden fleece.</P>
<P>There is no coming to the end of this &s;ubject, e&s;pecially circum&s;cribed as I am. I can therefore only &s;ay, in addition to the above remarks, that a practical knowledge of mu&s;ic, as far as it can be nece&s;&s;ary for common pur|po&s;es, is very ea&s;ily attained; for it con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than learning the gamut&mdash;the names, lengths, divi&s;ions, and mea&s;ure of the notes&mdash;di&s;tinc|tions of all the major and minor keys&mdash;the &s;ituations of the &s;emitones, and the doctrine of u&s;ing the &s;harp &s;eventh to modulate into the fifth of the key, and the flat &s;eventh to return to the original key. The&s;e, with all colateral matters, are nothing like &s;o difficult as the fir&s;t four rules of arithmetic, with the fractions relative to them; and yet, upon the &s;ame principle that Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Divi&s;ion comprehend the whole &s;tudy of figures, &s;o do the&s;e rules in mu&s;ic comprehend the whole &s;y&s;tem of harmony; and all there is more to be done is, to blend, &s;eparate, diver&s;ify, and in &s;hort, u&s;e them in every po&s;&s;ible point of view. Let not a &s;cholar then learn more than this, let it be learnt perfect, and then put in practice&mdash;which done, it is a thou&s;and to one&mdash;if there is any genius to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;tudy&mdash;but the whole &s;cience will lay clearly open to view:&mdash;if it &s;hould not, by the union of what has been learnt, it may be ea&s;ily attained; and it would be as ab&s;urd to teach mu&s;ic upon any other plan, as to &s;et a &s;um in the <HI>Rule of three</HI> for a &s;cholar who had not learnt his Numeration Table.</P>
<P>With all this, great care mu&s;t be u&s;ed in the choice of a ma&s;ter; and as to teachers decrying good mu&s;ic, and introducing fal&s;e ta&s;te, I &s;ee no cure for

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>Such marches and countermarches!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS a dramatic writer collects all his matter toge|ther at the beginning of the la&s;t act, in order to introduce his <HI>Coup de Theatre,</HI> which, as it may &s;uit him, either leads to, or fini&s;hes the cata&s;trophe, &s;o &s;hall I immediately carry into one general account all the remains of places, inns, and other &s;ubordinate matter, in order to introduce &s;uch a <HI>Coup de Theatre</HI> as &s;hall command applau&s;e at the fall of the curtain.</P>
<P>I have mentioned already the opulence and populou&s;ne&s;s of LEEDS, and &s;hall take my final leave of the inhabitants as a &s;pirited, manly, and enlight|ened people, who have the indu&s;try to get money, and the liberality to &s;pend it, It has two very large cloth-halls, and the a&s;&s;embly-room is by far the hand&s;ome&s;t I &s;aw in my tour, for a &s;ingle room.</P>
<P>HALIFAX is an a&s;toni&s;hing trading town for its &s;ize. I &s;aw the cloth-hall on a market day, and it gave me an idea of a bee-hive; the prodigious number of cells, and the porters coming in and out with their bundles of cloth, were exactly the loaded bees. The pari&s;h contains twelve chapels of ea&s;e, and is &s;aid to be worth about twelve hundred a year.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284">MANCHESTER is a charming town, and I have &s;een nothing &s;uperior to <HI>Mo&s;ely-&s;treet,</HI> but <HI>Portland-&s;quare.</HI> The number of people on a market day is a&s;toni&s;hing, and the entrance into the town from STOCKPORT&mdash;which is to MAN|CHESTER what WOLVERHAMPTON is to BIRMINGHAM&mdash;is very magnificent. The choir in the Collegiate church is beautiful, and the progre&s;s of the ma|nufactories, and in particular the cutting fu&s;tians, and pa&s;&s;ing even the fine&s;t mu&s;lins over a red hot iron, are matters a&s;toni&s;hingly curious, and which, if time permitted, I &s;hould have great plea&s;ure in dwelling on.</P>
<P>LIVERPOOL is beyond all que&s;tion the fir&s;t town in the kingdom after LONDON; its capacious docks, its roomy &s;torehou&s;es, its enten&s;ive and well-filled harbour, the prodigious plenty in its markets, particularly of corn&mdash;its &s;pacious &s;quares, its magnificent public buildings, of which the Change is a mo&s;t capital one&mdash;its churches, and indeed all that great variety of edifices for duty, bu&s;ine&s;s, and plea&s;ure, to which by act of parliament they are now making con&s;iderable additions, abundantly prove the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. I did not &s;ee the theatre at MANCHESTER, but that at LIVERPOOL, which is altering upon an admirable plan, under the direction of Mr. TAYLOR, is &s;pa|cious, convenient, and hand&s;ome. I counted in the directory nearly an hun|dred &s;treets, and this circum&s;tance obliges me again to &s;peak di&s;advantageou&s;ly of MANCHESTER, which place has, unlike LIVERPOOL, neither <HI>directory</HI> nor <HI>hackney coaches.</HI></P>
<P>DURHAM, in &s;ummer, mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ituations in ENGLAND. The river, the ca&s;tle, the cathedral, the bi&s;hop's palace, and the &s;traggling &s;uburbs, pre&s;ent you with a new and picture&s;que view wherever you turn. It is remarkable for a good choir of &s;ingers; indeed the &s;alaries are higher here than any where, and in con&s;equence&mdash;for encouragement wonderfully nurtures genius&mdash;our concerts have been well &s;tocked from thence. The more genteel part of the inhabitants are more a community than a neighbourhood, a family than a &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="285">NEWCASTLE is ancient and romantic, and the inhabitants &s;eem to reli&s;h of both. They give you an idea of a man who piques him&s;elf on his birth and extraction, though his man&s;ion is mouldering and his e&s;tate falling to de|cay. I do not mean to &s;ay that NEWCASTLE is not rich&mdash;it is remarkably &s;o, and I am informed ho&s;pitable. However, there mu&s;t be a manner with me&mdash;it is not the &s;ize of the di&s;h, but the &s;tyle in which it is dre&s;&s;ed; not the number of eatables, but the mode of their being put on the table; and, after all, it is not the wine, but the conver&s;ation that accompanies it. NEW|CASTLE &s;eems to have very little ta&s;te. There is a new and remarkably hand&s;ome <HI>theatre,</HI> which is a hobby-hor&s;e at pre&s;ent, and will, in all proba|bility, be thrown away next year for &s;ome other bawble. In &s;hort&mdash;for I am always obliged to have recour&s;e to LIVERPOOL when I would make an advantageous compari&s;on&mdash;NEWCASTLE is proud, LIVERPOOL indu&s;trious&mdash;NEWCASTLE is near, LIVERPOOL liberal&mdash;and one may pretty well conclude, that if they did not dig their riches out of the bowels of the earth, and un|load them in the river Thames, they would not count on their riches; for they would never have the &s;pirit and courage to adventure for them, with any degree of intrepidity, to the farthe&s;t corner of the world. The road from YORK to DARLINGTON is beautiful. It is a heavy &s;tage from DAR|LINGTON to DURHAM, and, on account of the hills, &s;till heavier from DUR|HAM to NEWCASTLE.</P>
<P>For the inns I mu&s;t go back again to BIRMINGHAM, where there are &s;everal good ones, but all immoderately dear. At LICHFIELD, which is in the public road from LONDON to LIVERPOOL, they are pretty good and to|lerably rea&s;onable. At DERBY much better for accommodations, but much the &s;ame as to their charge. At NOTTINGHAM, the <HI>Blackamoor's Head</HI> is an inn where travellers will be &s;hewn every civility, get good entertainment and accommodation, and upon moderate terms. I have &s;poken of NEWARK.&mdash;At LINCOLN I would recommend the <HI>Spread Eagle,</HI> which is a decent, civil hou&s;e, and rea&s;onable. At BARTON, where it may &s;ometimes happen that
<PB N="279" REF="286">
you are obliged to &s;tay &s;everal hours, and where you generally arrive wet from HULL, there is but one mi&s;erable inn, the &s;malle&s;t accommodation or any thing decent by way of eating and drinking. BAKER's, at HULL, is a very good inn&mdash;and &s;o is the <HI>Tyger,</HI> at BEVERLY At YORK, and every where in the north road, there are good inns, but in general very dear&mdash;the <HI>Angel,</HI> at DONCASTER, in particular. At LEEDS there is not a real good inn in the town. At HALIFAX they are not remarkable for appearance, but they are for decent neatne&s;s, and good eatables and drinkables, and the lowe&s;t charges any where in York&s;hire. At WAKEFIELD, the <HI>Stratford Arms</HI> is a very good inn, and they pay you attention, and charge pretty rea&s;onable. At MANCHESTER there is not a &s;ingle good inn, and the treatment is in&s;olent beyond de&s;cription&mdash;at lea&s;t where I have been. Only &s;ee the gradation&mdash;at HALIFAX I paid <HI>four</HI> &s;hillings for the &s;ame tea, &s;upper, and breakfa&s;t, which at DONCASTER co&s;t me <HI>nine,</HI> and at MANCHESTER <HI>thirteen</HI>;&mdash;but this la&s;t was at the <HI>Hotel,</HI> which exactly gives you the idea of a bagnio in LONDON.&mdash;This <HI>Hotel</HI> belongs to the man who keeps the <HI>Bull's Head,</HI> at which hou&s;e I had a room, and an indifferent one for the performance, yet were my friends under a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king it as a &s;ort of favour, though the man was hand|&s;omely paid, and the accommodations were very contemptible indeed. As to DIXON, at the <HI>Swan,</HI> the la&s;t time I was at MANCHESTER I was from &s;even o'clock in the morning till eleven getting away in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and during that time, having a letter to &s;eal and a parcel to tie up, after&mdash;in the cour&s;e of an hour and a half&mdash;intreating the favour of a wafer and a bit of pack thread; I was at length obliged to go to a &s;hop to buy it, and the man told me he did not wonder at it, for it was a remark that the innkeepers of MANCHES|TER &s;pit in people's faces in return for their favours. As far as my experience goes, this u&s;age extends al&s;o to lodging-hou&s;es. Every body knows where I lodged at MANCHESTER, and I paid there for board and lodging full <HI>four times</HI> as much as I was charged at LIVERPOOL for <HI>better living.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I did not think, when I was mo&s;t &s;hamefully impo&s;ed upon in FRANCE, I &s;hould have an op|portunity of celebrating a more &s;candalous piece of knavery in ENGLAND. At NANCY, in LORRAINE I lodged in the hou&s;e of a Mr. VILLEMETTE, and having experienced a few of their tricks, I had pre|viou&s;ly determined to be on my guard. I paid him at the end of every week, and took his receipt. When I came to a final &s;ettlement, he gave me the week's receipt as u&s;ual, but begged I would &s;ettle the remainder. I a&s;ked what he meant, for that I had paid him every thing. He &s;aid it was true that I had paid him every thing, &s;uppo&s;ing our agreement to have been in money of LORRAINE, but that it had been in money of FRANCE, and, reckoning the difference of the currency, I was then in his debt ju&s;t thireen guineas. I an&s;wered that fortunately I knew &s;o much of their laws as to be well convinced that all bargains were good only for money of LORRAINE, unle&s;s made before two witne&s;&s;es: this he &s;aid he had taken care of, and immediately produced the witne&s;&s;es, whom I had never &s;een before. I &s;aw I was to be tricked, and a&s;ked them if they would go before the general of the police, and &s;wear it. VOLUNTIER MONSIEUR, was the an&s;wer. I put them to the te&s;t, and they &s;wallowed the oath with all the calmne&s;s imaginable. I a&s;ked the general of the police what he thought of the bu&s;ine&s;s: he &s;aid he knew them all to be infamous &s;coundrels, that it was a pity I could not &s;tay to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice; but if I would leave ten guineas in his hand, he had no doubt but he &s;hould give me a good account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ine&s;s. I however contented my&s;elf with my fir&s;t lo&s;s, and went away without even thanking the ge|neral of the police for his politene&s;s.&mdash;The impo&s;ition at MANCHESTER was proportionably more &s;hameful than this.</NOTE> The inns
<PB N="280" REF="287" MS="y">
at LIVERPOOL are pretty rich, and therefore of cour&s;e pretty con&s;equential. Ma&s;ter FORSHAR, in particular, who&s;e room I had, has a good deal of con|&s;equence, but he has an idea of re&s;pect, and would be the fir&s;t to reprove his waiters for the &s;malle&s;t incivility to &s;trangers. As to their charges, the diligence took me to the <HI>Cro&s;s Keys,</HI> where I was very comfortable for a day or two, upon very rea&s;onable terms. The roads in Lanca&s;hire are, in gene|ral very &s;andy and bad, but this is &s;ometimes remedied by paving them, and in great part of York&s;hire there is a &s;tone cau&s;eway, which is a very agree|able recommendation to foot pa&s;&s;engers.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT had long been my ambition to bring out this work under the protection of the PRINCE OF WALES. For this purpo&s;e I &s;olicited the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t generous friend I have, who frequently has the honour of being where his ROYAL HIGHNESS vi&s;its, to do what he could with propriety to procure me this high and flattering advantage. Indefatiga|ble to oblige and &s;erve me, he did not let the matter re&s;t a &s;ingle moment, but watching the fir&s;t opportunity to mention it with proper decorum; the PRINCE, with all that amiable affability which ever di&s;tingui&s;hes the truly noble, conde&s;cendingly &s;ignified a wi&s;h to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>By his ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious appointment, I had the great honour, at the hou&s;e of a gentleman where my kind friend is very intimate, of playing and &s;inging in his pre&s;ence tho&s;e &s;ongs with which&mdash;not le&s;s as a correct and per|fect judge of mu&s;ic, than of nature, expre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;crimination&mdash;I thought he was mo&s;t likely to be entertained; and though I did not perform fewer than twen|ty, I had the &s;ingular &s;atisfaction to find I did nothing but what received perfect approbation, nor for nearly two hours did the time &s;eem to wear&mdash;even tho'

<P>My friend took an opportunity, before the PRINCE retired, to reque&s;t the honour of his name to my &s;ub&s;cription; to which his ROYAL HIGHNESS thought proper to an&s;wer <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I might u&s;e his name in any way that I thought would be of &s;ervice to me."</Q> No terms can convey a panegyric adequate to this noble conde&s;cen&s;ion; what could induce it but that true greatne&s;s of mind which, as PORTIA &s;ays of mercy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becomes the throned monarch better than his crown."</Q> But the genial &s;un cheri&s;hes not more the <HI>&s;pread|ing</HI> ROSE than the <HI>humble</HI> VIOLET.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall now, as faithfully as my memory will permit me, proceed to &s;tate the &s;ucce&s;s, both in profit and reputation, of every piece I have produced to the public. I am afraid, however, I &s;hall not be very ac|curate in my account of the more &s;ubordinate kind; for were I to be put to the torture, I could not enumerate &s;ome of the interludes and pantomimes which have been done at <HI>Sadler's Wells</HI> and &s;ome other places; nor can I place tho&s;e I do recollect in accurate order, as to their dates; I &s;hall, how|ever, be as correct as po&s;&s;ible, and where my intelligence is uncertain, I will my&s;elf &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s rather than fill up the blank by exaggeration.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Shepherd's Artifice,</HI> performed in May 1762, and 1763. This piece, which I wrote and compo&s;ed at <HI>&s;eventeen,</HI> was only got up for my own benefit. It has a thou&s;and faults, and in particular, as at that time I did not know how to put my mu&s;ical thoughts upon paper but by mere &s;trength of imagination, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the number of its inaccuracies. The&s;e however the &s;ame force of fancy enabled me to correct, and, without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, I produced the &s;ame piece in a perfect &s;tate, by only li&s;tening to the faults as I heard them in the band. It was performed at two of my benefits,
<PB N="286" REF="293" MS="y">
and each time brought a tolerable hou&s;e&mdash;but it never came forward in the com|mon bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>theatre.</HI> The mu&s;ic was very much applauded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will not here be improper to remark that I never learnt more of mu&s;ic than the gamut and the table which points out the divi&s;ion of the time. Mr. FUSSEL, the organi&s;t of WINCHESTER cathe|dral, I am told, &s;ays I owe my mu&s;ical education to him&mdash;which a&s;&s;ertion contains &s;o much truth, that five or &s;ix very common tunes, which I now have in his hand writing, are all I ever was taught. Mr. KENT had afterwards the credit of having taught me&mdash;but, except &s;ome anthems which he compo&s;ed for me, and which I learnt by ear, I never received the &s;malle&s;t in&s;truction from him. The mu&s;ic I have was &s;trongly in my mind from my earlie&s;t remembrance, and I do not think any ma&s;ter would have been of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ervice to me. It lay quietly, a hidden &s;park&mdash;which, in the country, found nothing to vivify it&mdash;but, coming in contact with that proper fuel for it, the different mu&s;ical per|formances in town, it at once expanded, and nothing could keep it within bounds. I &s;carcely knew this my&s;elf till being pre&s;ent at a rehear&s;al of <HI>Thomas and Sally,</HI> all that pa&s;t &s;o tenaciou&s;ly adhered to my memory, that I went home, drew out a &s;core, and, after attending another rehear&s;al, filled up the accompanyments. It was certainly incorrect&mdash;but, for &s;uch an effort, in a very trifling degree; for I was not then &s;ixteen. I found, however, I was in the &s;ecret, and immediately took the concertos of CORRELLI, in &s;ingle parts, and put them into &s;core. Here I went, upon good authority, through every turning and twining in the labyrinth of harmony. I next got hold of RAMEAU, and having proved theoretically by one, and practically by the other, the difference between pa&s;&s;ing and emphatic notes&mdash;the nature of &s;uppo&s;ed ba&s;&s;es&mdash;and found, by a fair trial of the&s;e matters in every point of view, that two chords comprehend the whole &s;y&s;tem of harmony, I determined fearle&s;&s;ly to give a loo&s;e to my fancy:&mdash;to what purpo&s;e is pretty well known.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Love in the City,</HI> performed in the year 1764&mdash;a piece written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed but &s;ix nights. In this I compo&s;ed the <HI>overture,</HI> the <HI>fir&s;te horus,</HI> the <HI>finales</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd acts,</HI> and three &s;ongs. <HI>Love in the City</HI> has &s;ince been altered into the farce of the <HI>Romp,</HI> in which the <HI>chorus,</HI> the <HI>quintetto,</HI> the <HI>boxing trio,</HI> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear me how I long to be married,"</Q> are mine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot here omit an anecdote which tells greatly to the honour of Dr. ARNE. SIMPSON, the hautboy player, and &s;ome others per&s;uaded Mr. BEARD t at my mu&s;ic would do his theatre di&s;credit, and that in particular the overture and a &s;ong beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah why my dear,"</Q> were written entirely again&s;t the <HI>rules of harmony.</HI> This Mr. BEARD&mdash;who had more goodnature than any other quality in the world&mdash;was ea&s;ily brought to believe. Hearing what was going forward, I took the copy of the overture and &s;ong and prevailed on hone&s;t TOMMY BAKER&mdash;whom all the world knows&mdash;to accompany me, waited on Dr. ARNE. The Doctor, after looking carefully over the &s;cores, &s;aid there was nothing again&s;t the rules of harmony, that it was a pity Mr. SIMPSON would not &s;tick to his hautboy, without pretending to judge of what he was not at all acquainted with, and that if I would privately inform him when there was to be another rehear&s;al, he would him&s;elf attend. This I &s;ailed not to do&mdash;and finding tho&s;e pieces altered by &s;ome other per&s;on, the Doctor begged to hear the original copies. The&s;e were pro|duced, and played over, when he pronounced the whole bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;candalous attempt to injure the repu|tation of a young man, whom, if they had had any liberality, it would have been their duty to encou|rage. In con&s;equence of the Doctor's deci&s;ion, my mu&s;ic was re&s;tored and performed with &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> This mu&s;ic I made Mr. BICKERSTAFF a pre&s;ent of.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="287" REF="294">3 <HI>Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a</HI>&mdash;written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed in the &s;ea&s;on of 1767 and 1768. By looking at the index it will be &s;een that, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, I compo&s;ed for this piece about twenty-five things, for which trouble I received, at different times, forty-eight pounds&mdash;giving up the copy|right. The &s;ale of this mu&s;ic did not yield much, till it came out under the title of <HI>The School for Fathers</HI>; otherwi&s;e I think I &s;hould not have been &s;o completely overreached in the following agreement.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>The Padlock</HI>&mdash;written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in October 1768. The &s;ucce&s;s of this piece is pretty well known all over the kingdom; it may not, however, be ami&s;s to mention that no con|ception can be formed of the &s;ale of the mu&s;ic. <HI>Comus</HI> is known to have &s;old very exten&s;ively, but after upwards of thirty years, three fourths of the ori|ginal plates are &s;till in u&s;e. What then will be &s;aid when I a&s;&s;ure the public the <HI>Padlock</HI> had, <HI>&s;even</HI> years ago, nearly worn out three entire &s;ets! But how will their wonder be augmented when I declare, upon the faith of a man, that I never received, in the whole, for compo&s;ing that mu&s;ic, but forty-five pounds; though I dare &s;ay the &s;ale of the mu&s;ic alone yielded Mr. BICKERSTAFF nearly five hundred pounds. In addition to this, his benefit yielded two hundred pounds, Mr. GARRICK made him a pre&s;ent of one hun|dred pounds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;ome times a private compact from <HI>managers</HI> to <HI>authors</HI> to give an extra benefit on the twentieth night of a piece.

<ITEM>5 <HI>The Maid the Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>&mdash;performed in the &s;ummer of 1769, at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. Having made an agreement that &s;ea&s;on to compo&s;e for <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and occa&s;ionally &s;ing, for which trouble I was to have an hundred guineas, this piece comes within that article, and the mu&s;ic has never yet been publi&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6 <HI>The Recruiting Serjeant</HI>&mdash;performed the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, on the &s;ame terms. I publi&s;hed the mu&s;ic on my own account, and found it un&s;ucce&s;sful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7 <HI>The Jubilee</HI>&mdash;written by Mr. GARRICK, and performed in October 1769. It would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k to go through the variety of circum&s;tances which di&s;tingui&s;h this memorable bu&s;ine&s;s; but nothing de&s;erves notice more truly than that SHAKESPEAR might have laid very quietly in STRATFORD church&mdash;nobody would have di&s;turbed his a&s;hes&mdash;had not &s;uch a popular mea&s;ure been the probable means of in&s;uring a plentiful harve&s;t to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="297">
on the following &s;ea&s;on. And yet, it was <HI>managed</HI> with &s;o much caution, &s;o much warine&s;s, that, according to the repre&s;entation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it, there did not appear any &s;uch thing in agita|tion. This cautiou&s;ne&s;s an&s;wered two purpo&s;es&mdash;it not only drew many to STRATFORD who would otherwi&s;e have &s;u&s;pended their curio&s;ity till they &s;hould &s;ee it in LONDON, but it &s;erved as a fea&s;ible excu&s;e for reque&s;ting every body's trouble and attendance for nothing. Thus, among the re&s;t, I took unwearied pains&mdash;not &s;eeing that I &s;hould materially a&s;&s;i&s;t in filling the coffers of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> trea&s;ury&mdash;without any emolument to my&s;elf. All this, however, I could have forgiven, if I had not been obliged to &s;u&s;tain fifty hu|miliations. I will venture to &s;ay that had it not been for <HI>my</HI> mu&s;ic the audience would have &s;hewn much more di&s;&s;atisfaction. They were not in very good humour as it was. They heard certainly Dr. ARNE's beautiful Oratorio of <HI>Judith,</HI> and his charming mu&s;ic of the Ode&mdash;and what was the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite and inexpre&s;&s;ible treat that ever tran&s;cendent abilities could convey, or longing ears experience, they heard GARRICK repeat that Ode. Yet, being di&s;appointed of the Pageant&mdash;being wet through at the Ma&s;querade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The booth being built on a &s;wamp clo&s;e to the river, and nobody having con&s;idered that &s;ome|times in the month of September it rains, the company had &s;carcely a&s;&s;embled, when the wet began to ooze through the crevices; in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet; five minutes after that it was over their &s;hoes, and pre&s;ently they were obliged to take to the benches, then to the orche&s;tra, and then to the windows&mdash;thus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that e&s;caped be|ing wet through.</NOTE>&mdash;they were certainly very much di&s;contented; which di&s;&s;atisfaction would more than &s;ilently have manife&s;ted it&s;elf, had not <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Warwick&s;hire Lads, &amp;c."</Q> brought them into good humour:&mdash;yet was that very &s;ong privately &s;et by Mr. AYLWARD, and the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mulberry Tree"</Q> by Dr. BOYCE, and had not my kind friend, Mr. GARRICK, been told at a rehear&s;al, where I was <HI>not pre&s;ent,</HI> that mine were &s;et the be&s;t for effect, he would have waved all delicacy to me, and have had theirs performed. GEORGE GARRICK, who, where DAVID's immediate intere&s;t did not cla&s;h, could be ju&s;t to all the world, informed me
<PB N="291" REF="298">
of this fact.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GEORGE GARRICK, who I have &s;aid before was warmly attached to his brother, was remark|ably attentive to all his little whims and caprices upon this great occa&s;ion. Indeed he had &s;o many ad|mirable traits of real goodne&s;s that it is no wonder, partly from gratitude, partly from the amiable wor|thine&s;s of his heart, he &s;hould con&s;ider DAVID as a being who had a right to exact an extraordinary de|gree of attention from every body, but particularly from him. The other, who never failed to encou|rage adulation wherever he found it, improved the influence he had over GEORGE, till he brought it to &s;omething &s;o very like meanne&s;s, that it could not be palliated but by the real motives to which I have a&s;cribed it. In con&s;equence of this &s;lavi&s;h attention, GEORGE was always in anxiety le&s;t in his ab&s;ence his brother &s;hould have wanted him, and the fir&s;t que&s;tion he con&s;tantly a&s;ked on his return was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did DAVID want me?"</Q> GEORGE GARRICK died about three months after his brother, which circum|&s;tance being mentioned in the green-room, and marked as &s;omething extraordinary&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Extraordinary!"</Q> aid BANNISTER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not at all&mdash;DAVID <HI>wanted him!</HI>"</Q></NOTE> In &s;hort, GARRICK, in relation to the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> manoeuvred every where, and with every body. He procured abu&s;e to be in&s;erted in the papers, which he got all his friends to an&s;wer. He enli&s;ted a prodigious num|ber of volunteers, who&s;e exertions he pretty liberally extracted, at their ex|pence; and at length performed the &s;ame entertainment ninety-five times, in one &s;ea&s;on, at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> which he &s;ent people an hundred miles <HI>not</HI> to &s;ee. The mu&s;ic of the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> having &s;old it, previous to the performance, at STRATFORD&mdash;except &s;ome trifling part of it&mdash;yielded altogether about forty-three pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8 <HI>Damon and Phillida</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on. This piece I was de&s;ired, by Mr. GARRICK, to alter and new &s;et. I was told that there was no &s;ettled price for &s;uch a job, but I might make out a bill. I conceived this a good opportunity to make me amends for the trouble I had with the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> and did it cheerfully. The piece was not often performed, but before the time arrived to talk of &s;ettling for it, Mr. GARRICK propo&s;ed to enter into an article for &s;even years, at &s;ix pounds a week for the three fir&s;t years, and &s;even pounds for the other four; and in making the agreement he contrived&mdash;or LACY, in&s;tructed by him, as I mentioned before&mdash;to include every thing that was yet unaccounted for; &s;o <HI>Damon and Phillida</HI> went for nothing, except fifteen pounds, for which I &s;old the copyright of the mu&s;ic.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="292" REF="299">9 <HI>The Ephe&s;ian Matron</HI>&mdash;written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. The &s;ame ar|ticle went over to a &s;econd &s;ea&s;on at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> where this piece was performed, and under this article I compo&s;ed it. The publication of this mu&s;ic was &s;old on &s;ome eventual agreement, and I think yielded me only a few pounds&mdash;but I cannot at this moment &s;ay what. This piece was performed about thirty times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10 <HI>The Brickdu&s;t-man,</HI> a little mu&s;ical piece, performed at <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. This trifle had great &s;ucce&s;s, and introduced an engagement which I entered into with Mr. KING, which though no great matter as to emolument, was as good as <HI>Sadlers Wells</HI> could afford, and one of the plea&s;ante&s;t I ever made. Indeed I am happy to have this opportunity of acknowledging my great regard and re&s;pect for this gentleman, which I hold from principle, and the re&s;ult of many years experience of his manly, liberal, and uniform conduct; and he mu&s;t forgive me if, feeling thus, I here make a public acknowledgment of the letter I received from him at MANCHESTER, wherein he &s;ub&s;cribed to this book, and gave as a rea&s;on, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;hould be &s;orry to be left out of the li&s;t of my well-wi&s;hers."</Q> This friend&s;hip, dear &s;ir, is of the complexion of yours&mdash;for which, give me leave to &s;ay,</ITEM>

<ITEM>11. <HI>The Pigmy Revels</HI>&mdash;a pantomime which was performed in the &s;ea&s;on of 1770 and 1771, with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. I know not who wrote the words, I only &s;et the mu&s;ic, and it produced me no emolument, as it came under my article.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12 <HI>The Wedding Ring</HI>&mdash;the &s;ea&s;on of 1771 and 1772. This piece I wrote and compo&s;ed&mdash;but fore&s;eeing the difficulties I was likely to encounter, had no intention of making my&s;elf known as the author. The world recol|lects the ignominy with which Mr. BICKERSTAFF left this kingdom, and an invidious public print had the audacity to attribute this piece to him. Finding the attack a very &s;erious one, I immediately made an affidavit that Mr. BICK|ERSTAFF was <HI>not</HI> the author, and publi&s;hed it. This oath was called a preva|ricating one, becau&s;e it did not &s;ay <HI>who was</HI> the author, and a whole &s;tring of paragraphs of a mo&s;t abu&s;ive kind were immediately levelled at me, in the &s;ame paper. I did not wait for the tedious forms of law, but endeavoured to take that &s;ort of revenge which men perhaps imprudently endeavour to do, when the offence is beyond legal reparation. The printer however had as little <PB N="294" REF="301">
courage to meet my anger as he had principle in &s;eeking to wound my charac|ter. He left town to avoid me, and for &s;ome time was not to be &s;een. I therefore moved the Court of King's Bench for him to &s;hew cau&s;e why an in|formation &s;hould not lodge again&s;t him for printing a libel. The rule was <HI>granted,</HI> and afterwards <HI>made ab&s;olute</HI>; and there is no doubt but the gentle|man would have been publicly exhibited, had not my attorney taken it into his head, to decamp to FRANCE with the money, which, to the great credit of the <HI>Drury-lane</HI> performers&mdash;who in&s;i&s;ted upon taking up this attrocious matter as a public cau&s;e&mdash;was rai&s;ed by a &s;ub&s;cription among them&s;elves to defend the action. On the fir&s;t night of this piece, I was called on the &s;tage, and required to declare the author, which I did without he&s;itation; and the matter taking this turn, I re&s;olved, in&s;tead of concealing my name, always in future to an|nounce it, and rely on the public for the event. I had a benefit for this piece over and above my article, which yielded me upwards of an hundred pounds. The publication of the mu&s;ic I undertook my&s;elf, and got nothing by it. In|deed I have always made this remark, that the mu&s;ic I have &s;old has yielded but very little, except to the publi&s;hers; and that I have publi&s;hed on my own account has con&s;tantly brought me in debt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13 <HI>The In&s;tallation</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on&mdash;written by Mr. GARRICK, and compo&s;ed under my article. This I &s;old, with a &s;et of harp&s;ichord le&s;&s;ons, for a conditional &s;ixty-five pounds. The conditions were fulfilled, and I re|ceived the money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14 <HI>The Ladle</HI>&mdash;a little piece for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> in the &s;ea&s;on of 1772, written and compo&s;ed by me.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15 <HI>The Mi&s;chance</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame place, and al&s;o written and compo&s;ed by me. For the publication of this piece, <HI>The Ladle,</HI> and <HI>The Brickdu&s;t-man,</HI> I received thirty guineas.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16 &amp; 17 Two pantomimes&mdash;the names I cannot recollect. The publi|cation of one of the&s;e I &s;old for ten guineas.</ITEM>

<ITEM>20 <HI>Trip to Port&s;mouth</HI>&mdash;written by G. A. STEVENS, and performed at the <HI>Haymarket</HI> with good &s;ucce&s;s. I received for the compo&s;ition and the pub|lication of the mu&s;ic nearly fifty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>21 <HI>The De&s;erter</HI>&mdash;altered from the French, and performed at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> in the years 1772 and 1773&mdash;the mu&s;ic partly retained, partly &s;upplied from <HI>Philidor,</HI> and partly mine. For this piece I had a benefit, which yielded me about ninety pounds&mdash;the mu&s;ic turned out a very trifle&mdash;I got by the publica|tion of the words about thirty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22 <HI>The Chri&s;tmas Tale</HI>&mdash;written by Mr. GARRICK, and performed the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on. The intrin&s;ic value of this compo&s;ition being equal to my whole &s;alary, I expo&s;tulated with Mr. GARRICK&mdash;who &s;aid he con&s;idered it in the &s;ame light, and I &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain. My trouble on this oc|ca&s;ion was inconceivable, and I expected my extra reward would be propor|tionable; but when the end of the &s;ea&s;on arrived, in the office were found two promi&s;&s;ory notes of ten pounds each, which I had given by way of memo|randums at two different &s;ettlements, and the&s;e were &s;ent me by GEORGE GARRICK, as a valuable con&s;ideration for my additional trouble. The publi|cation of the mu&s;ic I &s;old for twenty-five pounds down, twenty-five pounds on the twelfth night, twenty-five pounds on the eighteenth night, and twenty-five pounds on the twenty-<HI>fifth.</HI> The piece was performed twenty-<HI>four</HI> times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>24, 25, 26, 27, 28 &amp; 29 Two pantomimes, and four little pieces for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> under my article.</ITEM>

<ITEM>37 <HI>The Waterman</HI>&mdash;performed the &s;ame &s;ummer, 1774, at the <HI>Hay|market.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s of this piece is well known. The benefit yielded me but thirty-five pounds. The publication of the words about forty-eight, and the mu&s;ic I believe about thirty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>38 <HI>The Cobler</HI>&mdash;performed in the &s;ea&s;on 1774 and 1775. Mr. GARRICK would in&s;i&s;t upon having this piece. I had taken to him <HI>The Seraglio,</HI> which was afterwards performed at <HI>Covent Garden</HI>&mdash;and which if I had been on the &s;pot I am convinced would have had better &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;but he had conceived great di&s;plea&s;ure at my bringing out <HI>The Waterman</HI> at the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> though under different pretences he refu&s;ed to perform it him&s;elf, and therefore I mu&s;t write, he &s;aid, a direct <HI>farce,</HI> and nothing el&s;e, which the more I altered the le&s;s I liked, though the alterations were to plea&s;e him. At length, I under&s;tood he did not intend to perform any thing; but having urged him pretty &s;trenuou&s;ly, he &s;aid it &s;hould be done if I would get it up in a week. This I did to his a&s;toni&s;hment; and the next news was that the Lord Chamberlain would not licen&s;e it. Upon my talking of waiting on Lord HERTFORD about it, as there was nothing immoral in it, all of a &s;udden a licen&s;e arrived, and the picce came out.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR BRERETON's benefit in 1775, I brought out <LIST>
<ITEM>39 <HI>The Quaker.</HI> This piece meeting with &s;ucce&s;s, he bought it of me for &s;eventy pounds, and &s;old it afterwards to GARRICK for an hundred. Had I not parted with it in this way, however, I might have kept it by me, for GARRICK had for &s;ome time determined not to produce any thing of my writ|ing, if he could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it. He had no idea that I intended to dabble in this way, when he &s;igned the article, and therefore conceived my whole em|ploy would be to &s;et words of his writing; and a ble&s;&s;ed time I &s;hould have had on't, if I had never done any thing el&s;e. For this purpo&s;e, he was &s;chem|ing to get rid of Mr. BICKERSTAFF as fa&s;t as he could, and the very particular civilities he ju&s;t then &s;hewed that pretty gentleman, to cover his intention, probably procured him that &s;candalous and unde&s;erved poem from Dr. KEN|RICK&mdash;his wi&s;hes however were anticipated, as the world knows. When I produced him the <HI>Wedding Ring,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>De&s;erter,</HI> he found I could make &s;ome &s;tand in this way, and his di&s;content from that moment was evi|dent to every body. He was like <HI>Captain Plume,</HI> he would not have a man who could write in his company. Indeed, the mo&s;t tremendous weapon in
<PB N="298" REF="305">
the world to GARRICK&mdash;was <HI>a pen. The Waterman</HI> following up the <HI>De&s;erter,</HI> and becoming al&s;o very popular, my bu&s;ine&s;s was done. I have &s;hewn how he behaved in the affair of the <HI>Cobler</HI>; and as to the <HI>Quaker,</HI> he would not have &s;uffered it to be got up at BRERETON's benefit had not the latter in&s;i&s;ted upon it as his right. Even then, the copy was &s;ubmitted to his in&s;pection, and he returned it with a &s;neer, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he wi&s;hed him &s;ucce&s;s, but he was rather afraid the &s;pirit would move the audience to damn it."</Q> BRERETON took fire at this, and &s;hewed it to his friend Mr. SHERIDAN, who &s;poke of it in terms of commendation. All difficulties were now at an end, Mr. SHERI|DAN's pen was more to be feared than mine. The next &s;ea&s;on. Mr. GARRICK purcha&s;ed it, as I mentioned before, but not with a view of performing it, for this piece did not make its &s;econd appearance till the management of <HI>Drury|lane</HI> fell into other hands. Added to the &s;eventy pounds, I received forty pounds for the publication of the words, and about the &s;ame &s;um for the mu|&s;ic. It will be &s;een that I did nothing of con&s;equence under my article, &s;ince the <HI>Chri&s;tmas Tale,</HI> which was entirely owing to this jealou&s;y of GARRICK's&mdash;in con&s;equence of which he gave the <HI>Maid of the Oaks</HI> to Mr. BARTHE|LEMON, and <HI>Alfred</HI> to THEODORE SMITH&mdash;in both of which pieces, by the bye, I received <HI>orders</HI> to make alterations, and &s;et additional &s;ongs. Altera|tions I peremptorily refu&s;ed to make, thinking it &s;candalou&s;ly indelicate to tho&s;e gentlemen; nor would I compo&s;e an additional &s;ong for <HI>Alfred</HI>&mdash;which Mr. BLANCHARD, of <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> then a child, may remember was intended for him&mdash;but, menaced with an action for the penalty of my article, rather than incur the forfeiture of five hundred pounds, I reluctantly &s;et the &s;ong be|ginning, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What cannot beauty, lovely beauty do?"</Q> in the <HI>Maid of the Oaks.</HI></ITEM>

left the care of it to Mr. FOOTE, who promi&s;ed to do every thing hand&s;ome in it, and went to FRANCE. The moment my back was turned, however, he forgot his promi&s;e&mdash;for he only performed it once more, and I reaped no manner of emolument from it whatever. Indeed, every thing, about this time, went at &s;ixes and &s;evens with him, for he never <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"joyed him&s;elf,"</Q> after the bu&s;ine&s;s of the coachman.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the end of this &s;ea&s;on, as every body knows, FOOTE was advi&s;ed to go to FRANCE, to di&s;&s;i|pate his chagrin. The morning he left NORTH END, going into his parlour, he fixed his eyes for &s;ome time on the print taken from that picture, &s;o admirably painted by ZOFFANI, of FOOTE and WESTON' in the <HI>Devil</HI> and Dr. <HI>La&s;t.</HI> At la&s;t, heaving a deep &s;igh, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas! poor WESTON!&mdash;very &s;oon it will be, alas! poor FOOTE!"</Q> He died about three weeks after.</NOTE> On the words I had a lo&s;s, and the mu&s;ic was never publi&s;hed.</ITEM>

<ITEM>51 <HI>The Seraglio.</HI> This piece was accepted by Mr. HARRIS, previous to my departure for FRANCE, and performed in the &s;ea&s;on 1776 and 1777. I &s;hould mention al&s;o that I then left my affairs in the hands of Dr. ARNOLD, who &s;uperintended them till my return, and common ju&s;tice bids me &s;ay, that he di&s;charged his tru&s;t with great honour and fidelity, for which kindne&s;s I now give him my public thanks. I have yet every letter he wrote me, and really there are many of the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted &s;entiments of friend|&s;hip I ever read. To &s;ay the truth, he had trouble enough on my account; for the fir&s;t &s;tipulation Mr. HARRIS made was to alter the pieces in whatever way he plea&s;ed. In con&s;equence of this, when I came to read in the paper the plot of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> at CALAIS, I found it totally different from that which I had &s;ent, and I remember the doctor's letter that accompanied the ac|count of its reception, &s;ays, that if I were to &s;ee it I &s;hould &s;carcely know my own piece. Mr. HARRIS al&s;o obliged him to new &s;et &s;ome of the &s;ongs, which he a&s;&s;ures me was a mo&s;t irk&s;ome ta&s;k, but he rather undertook it than that
<PB N="330" REF="307">
the piece &s;hould not be performed. The benefit for this yielded me forty-eight pounds, the words fifty, and I &s;old the mu&s;ic for an eventual &s;ixty pounds&mdash;forty-five of which became due.</ITEM>
<ITEM>52, 53, 54, 55 <HI>The Razor Grinder&mdash;Yo, Yea, or the Friendly Tars&mdash;Old Woman of Eighty</HI>&mdash;and <HI>The Mad Doctor</HI>&mdash;four pieces which I &s;ent Mr. KING from FRANCE. The&s;e pieces were &s;old out and out at a very rea&s;onable price. But I again repeat that all my engagements with Mr. KING were plea&s;urable ones, and had I made him a pre&s;ent of half I have done for him, I &s;hould &s;till be under obligations to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>56 <HI>Poor Vulcan</HI>&mdash;a burletta, performed in the &s;ea&s;on 1777 and 1778, at <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> and which I boldly pronounce, had it been given to the pub|lic in the &s;tate I &s;ent it, would have had much greater &s;ucce&s;s. It is uniformly &s;aid that the fir&s;t act of this piece is remarkably complete; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that from the beginning of the &s;econd act to <HI>Vulcan's</HI> &s;oliloquy is as dull as any thing po&s;&s;ibly can be, and the rea&s;on is, the burle&s;que is totally dropt, and <HI>Adonis</HI>&mdash;by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. HULL's &s;omniferous mu&s;e&mdash;converted into a &s;ighing, dying, &s;leeping &s;wain; whereas I had made him a burle&s;que character, as well as the re&s;t.</ITEM>

<P>I am glad of this opportunity of &s;hewing how authors are treated by ma|nagers and their privy coun&s;ellors; and am ready to &s;tand or fall by the deci|&s;ion of the public on the merits of what has been taken away, and what &s;ub|&s;tituted. This &s;hall be con&s;idered in the next letter. In the mean time, re|joice with me, that at the end of two more, we &s;hall have waded together through this rubbi&s;h.</P>

of the benefits was rai&s;ed, by the famous coalition of Mr. SHERIDAN and Mr. HARRIS, to an hundred guineas. I however would not pay it, nor was it, after my po&s;itive refu&s;al, in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>57 <HI>The Gyp&s;ies</HI>&mdash;an after-piece, written by me, and compo&s;ed by Dr. ARNOLD. It was performed at the <HI>Haymarket</HI> in the &s;ummer of 1778, but was rather a lo&s;ing game. The profits&mdash;had there been any&mdash;were to have been divided.</ITEM>
<ITEM>58 <HI>The Touch&s;tone</HI>&mdash;performed in the &s;ea&s;on 1778 and 1779, a panto|mime, written and compo&s;ed by me, under a verbal agreement with Mr. HARRIS, at the rate of three hundred pounds for the quantity of three after-pieces, and every thing over and above to be paid for in proportion. This piece has been attributed to Mr. PILON, and to Mrs. COWLEY. The fact is, that in &s;pite of all I could do, Mr. HARRIS would be trying to foi&s;t in altera|tions, which had very nearly parted us before this entertainment came out. I con&s;ented however to none but a few that were made by Mr. GARRICK. After the piece was out however, and fairly Mr. HARRIS's property, it was not in my power to prevent his doing what he plea&s;ed with it; and by this means that contemptible &s;cene got into it of the <HI>rout,</HI> which I with particular plea&s;ure acknowledge is <HI>not</HI> mine: the emoluments however <HI>were,</HI> and they con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred pounds for the piece, as a performance, an hundred pounds by Mr. HARRIS for the copy-right of the words, and twenty pounds for the mu&s;ic.</ITEM>
<ITEM>59 <HI>Ro&s;e and Colin</HI>&mdash;a piece of one act, performed very frequently, and with great applau&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 <HI>Annette and Lubin</HI>&mdash;of the &s;ame de&s;cription, and performed as &s;ucce&s;s|fully.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="304" REF="311">61 <HI>The Wives revenged</HI>&mdash;rather longer, but of the &s;ame de&s;cription. The&s;e pieces&mdash;together with the <HI>Saloon,</HI> the <HI>Graces,</HI> and the <HI>Statue,</HI> afterwards per|formed with great &s;ucce&s;s at the <HI>Circus</HI>&mdash;are what I allude to in my letter to Mr. HARRIS. I received fifty pounds for each of them, and &s;ixty pounds for the mu&s;ic of the three from Mr. HARRIS&mdash;the words I kept, which, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, were unproductive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>62 A pantomime&mdash;the name of which I do not recollect.

<ITEM>63 <HI>The Chel&s;ea Pen&s;ioner</HI>&mdash;&s;ame &s;ea&s;on. This piece came out with Mi&s;s MORE's <HI>Percy</HI>&mdash;which tragedy, though it is by no means devoid of merit, was not well received; and my opera had like to have &s;uffered by being in company with it. The &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Chel&s;ea Pen&s;ioner,</HI> however, afterwards was very flattering; yet it was done but three nights in all&mdash;owing to the latene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on. Why Mr. HARRIS has not repeated it &s;ince, he knows be&s;t, as there were four &s;ongs encored on the la&s;t night it was performed. This piece was an overplus charge of an hundred pounds. The words I pub|li&s;hed according to cu&s;tom at a lo&s;s, and the mu&s;ic&mdash;except a few &s;ongs which were introduced into a periodical work&mdash;never was made public.</ITEM>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall not have room particularly to mention how much my pieces have &s;uffered from mutilation; however what I neglect in <HI>detail,</HI> I mu&s;t make up in <HI>point.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>64 <HI>Mirror</HI>&mdash;a pantomime burletta, performed with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> in the &s;ea&s;on of 1779 and 1780. This piece was &s;trong &s;atire, and therefore <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>cavier</HI> to the multitude,"</Q> who, however, were charmed with the &s;cenery. One circum&s;tance marks this performance very &s;trongly. The character of <HI>Punch,</HI> who&s;e <HI>bibbery bino</HI> begot all the <HI>fal de rals</HI> and <HI>te de rees,</HI> which have &s;o largely contributed to make up the reputation of Mr. ED|WIN, and which was a &s;atire upon <HI>non&s;en&s;e,</HI> is now forgotten for non&s;en&s;e it|&s;elf. For this piece, I received a &s;ixth of the &s;ix fir&s;t nights, amounting to about an hundred and thirty pounds. The words yielded me about twenty pounds, and the mu&s;ic ten pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>65 <HI>The Shepherde&s;s of the Alps</HI>&mdash;an opera in three acts. This piece fell for want of &s;upport. I remember VERNON's &s;aying, when he was a&s;ked why he did not get perfect, and play his be&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he &s;aw it was the general wi&s;h <PB N="306" REF="313"> the piece &s;hould be damned, and, as in duty bound, he lent it a hand."</Q> My agreement for this piece was, to have a third of the nine fir&s;t nights. It was performed but three. I received about &s;eventeen pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>66 <HI>Plymouth in an Uproar</HI>&mdash;a piece brought to me by a &s;eafaring gentle|man. I made &s;ome alterations in it at his de&s;ire, and it &s;ucceeded pretty well, being performed about twelve nights. My &s;hare of the profits came to about &s;ixty-five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>67 <HI>The I&s;landers</HI>&mdash;an opera of three acts, performed in the &s;ea&s;on of 1780 and 1781. This piece had very good &s;ucce&s;s, and is remembered to have con|tained &s;ome of Mrs. KENNEDY's mo&s;t favourite &s;ongs, and many other very popular things. I was to have had for it a third of the nine fir&s;t nights; but the KING coming to the performance on the &s;ixth, I was obliged to &s;ubmit to take in the tenth, which made a difference to me of more than fifty pounds. I however, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, got by this piece about three hundred and fifty pounds. In&s;tead of coming out in the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;econd &s;ea&s;on&mdash;which it might have done with con&s;iderable reputation&mdash;Mr. HARRIS made me cut it down into a farce, and call it <HI>The Marriage Act.</HI> The alte|rations this piece underwent, previous to its coming out, were innumerable. Some few of them were &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. HARRIS, but I'll venture to &s;ay it gained nothing by that. Mr. WOODFALL &s;aw a &s;ketch of the fir&s;t act, in a rough &s;tate, and in a letter which I have by me, declared it bid the faire&s;t for popularity of any thing he had &s;een. It was certainly a very great favourite with Mr. HARRIS, who advi&s;ed me not to confe&s;s my&s;elf the author, urging me with words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"more than belonged to &s;uch a trifle;"</Q> for he &s;aid JUNIUS was not yet known&mdash;and therefore he would not advi&s;e me to declare my&s;elf. To be &s;ure there were &s;ome flying reports that Mr. HARRIS wrote it him&s;elf&mdash;but it will hardly be thought he wi&s;hed tho&s;e to be credited.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="307" REF="314">68 <HI>Harlequin Free Ma&s;on</HI>&mdash;&s;ame &s;ea&s;on. This piece had a prodigious run. I wrote the words and compo&s;ed the mu&s;ic. My emoluments were &s;e|venty pounds from the theatre, I &s;old about 2700 books, which yielded me&mdash;for &s;o well are the&s;e things managed&mdash;about thirty-five pounds, and the mu&s;ic was di&s;tributed in a work called the <HI>Lyri&s;t,</HI> which publication yielded me nearly fifty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>69 <HI>Amphytrion</HI>&mdash;performed in the &s;ea&s;on of 1781 and 1782. This piece was the only in&s;tance in which I made a point of <HI>&s;ecuring my&s;elf.</HI> Mr. HAR|RIS and I parted, as I have before mentioned. I had nothing to do with con|ducting it, and it was performed but two nights. I received for it two hun|dred and eighty-five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 <HI>The Barrier of Parna&s;&s;us, The Graces, The Saloon, The Milkmaid, The Refu&s;al of Harlequin, The Land of Simplicity, The Pa&s;&s;ions, The Statue, Clump and Cud|den, The Benevolent Tar, The Regions of Accompli&s;hment, Lanca&s;hire Witches, The Ce&s;tus, Pandora, The Long Odds.</HI> The&s;e, two or three other panto|mimes, four or five <HI>intermezzos</HI> of a more trifling kind, and at lea&s;t fifteen bal|lads, each taking twelve or fourteen airs and an overture, with a variety of other matter, make up what I did for the <HI>Circus</HI>; where, in the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, I cleared upwards of nine hundred pounds&mdash;but from that moment, my con|nexion with this place has been a &s;eries of trouble, lo&s;s, and vexation, which, to enumerate, would make up as long a work as this I &s;hall &s;ay a few words on this head however in a future letter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>85 <HI>Liberty Hall</HI>&mdash;performed with the &s;ucce&s;s I have already &s;tated, at <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> in the &s;ea&s;on of 1785 and 1786. The benefit yielded forty-eight pounds, the words <HI>nothing,</HI> and the mu&s;ic&mdash;by which if it had been performed oftener I &s;hould have received a con&s;iderable &s;um&mdash;brought, though hand&s;omely bargained for, no great matter.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="308" REF="315">86 <HI>Harve&s;t Home</HI>&mdash;performed at the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> 1787. I was nine pounds in debt on the benefit, the words I &s;old for forty pounds, and the mu&s;ic did about as much as <HI>Liberty Hall.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e pieces, were I to go over every ground, would come up to very near an hundred, but <HI>Richmond, Marybone, Exeter Change,</HI> and &s;ome other places where I have produced performances, &s;hall be given in to heap up the mea&s;ure. What I have done will a&s;toni&s;h the reader &s;ufficiently&mdash;for he will &s;ee that, in twenty-three years, I have received only about five thou&s;and five hundred pounds, even when I add my different &s;alaries and annual benefits.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT now remains to add to my TOUR and the &s;tate|ment of pieces already given&mdash;the entertainment which I have &s;o often deli|vered, and frequently to very little purpo&s;e, under the title of READINGS and MUSIC. This I &s;hall follow up with &s;ome fini&s;hing ob&s;ervations, a very brief recapitulation of all I have advanced&mdash;placed by way of critique on my&s;elf in every po&s;&s;ible point of view&mdash;and, at length, a farewel to that country which I hope I have &s;hewn that I quit not upon &s;lavi&s;h and narrow, but liberal and laudable principles.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> have &s;een, but others will plea&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e me upon my platform, with a piano forte before me, mu&s;tering up either a patient, contented, or delighted &s;mile&mdash;but never a contemptuous one&mdash;according to the number either &s;cattered about or crowded in the room&mdash;and beginning, by way of</P>
<P><LABEL>EXORDIUM,</LABEL>
<Q>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</Q></P>
<P>The introduction to my entertainment ought to explain its nature and tendency. The fir&s;t would be no very ea&s;y matter to accompli&s;h, for it is of
<PB N="308" REF="317">
&s;o eccentric a kind that it will not in any re&s;pect tally with whatever may be mea&s;ured by the &s;tandard of regularity. But as to its drift, I believe it may have as legitimate preten&s;ions to public favour as any other amu&s;ement.&mdash;Matters of this kind in general aim at &s;atisfying the auditors, with an eye to the advantage of their fabricators; like the phy&s;ician, who, as he held out his hand for a &s;ee, and was profe&s;&s;ing how di&s;intere&s;ted he gave his advice&mdash;&s;aying <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I take all this pains for you'</Q>&mdash;was an&s;wered by the &s;ick Iri&s;hman, as he put the guinea into his hand&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'true, true, <HI>all</HI> for me, and a little for your&s;elf, doctor.'</Q></P>
<P>Were I kept to the letter of my promi&s;e, it would be my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to improve and amu&s;e. This text, however, I &s;hall divide; leaving it to others to in&s;truct, while I try the utmo&s;t of my poor endeavour to enter|tain. The be&s;t regulated under&s;tandings may pant for relaxation, at which time, trifles light as air are the welcome&s;t plea&s;ures. The mind unbent from its &s;everer duty, &s;hall find a very nothing full of charms. An <HI>anecdote,</HI> a <HI>bon mot,</HI> a <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> &s;hall be delicious. The&s;e will be my moments of tri|umph. Be&s;ides, I have a re&s;ource to which many have re&s;orted with won|derful &s;ucce&s;s. Sound has often proved a fortunate &s;uccedaneum for &s;en&s;e&mdash;for mu&s;ic, like charity, covers a multitude of faults. How often has the rickety deformity of a hobbling line been wrought into &s;ymmetry by the ele|gance of a beautiful pa&s;&s;age&mdash;an uncouth rhime rendered as &s;mooth as the honey of Hybla by the force of modulation&mdash;and a whole mouthful of exple|tives gracefully &s;wallowed by the operation only of a few chromatics.</P>
<P>Various friends, however, have &s;ugge&s;ted various improvements on my own ideas. One of the&s;e you would have taken for a cook, for he &s;aid he would undertake to &s;upply my mental banquet with a curious and plentiful collection of di&s;hes, &s;uitable to all palates. He told me he had <HI>roa&s;ted</HI> NA|BOBS, and <HI>&s;tewed</HI> PATRIOTS&mdash;<HI>&s;urprized</HI> GENERALS, and <HI>devilled</HI> LAWYERS. For needy gentlemen, become gamblers in their own defence, he had a choice quantity of <HI>pigeons.</HI> He had <HI>ducks</HI> and <HI>drakes</HI> for &s;peculators in the alley. Then
<PB N="309" REF="318">

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ong over, I thus went on.</P>
<P>I could not help confe&s;&s;ing there was certainly &s;ome ingenuity in this mode of &s;pinning mu&s;ic; but I thought it too much like the labours of the &s;pi|der, which&mdash;though curious&mdash;have neither <HI>beauty</HI> nor <HI>durability,</HI> I con&s;equently determined to rely on my own judgment. You will, therefore&mdash;proceeded I&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e me a painter, with my canva&s;s upon an eifel and my whole appa|ratus lying before me, preparing to pre&s;ent you with a faint &s;ketch of human nature; not as I have &s;ometimes &s;een it de&s;cribed, with the virtues ri&s;ing on each other like the Alps and Apenines, altogether as STUPENDOUS, and alto|gether as <HI>cold:</HI> nor again, as a thing &s;o fraught with depravity, &s;o pitiably contemptible that a man would rather be an <HI>oy&s;ter</HI> than an <HI>emperor</HI>&mdash;but as we &s;ee it every day, without making it either a flattering likene&s;s or a <HI>caricature</HI>; for, though I &s;hall throw the human mind&mdash;if I may be allowed the figure&mdash;into every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, yet I &s;hall not place it where I have not actually &s;een it. It may &s;ometimes be <HI>ludicrous,</HI> but it &s;hall be always <HI>like.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="326">Imagine, then, that I have now filled my canva&s;s with a number of lines, curves, parallels, perpendiculars, and dots; faintly to repre&s;ent a large groupe of characters&mdash;one projecting a leg, another an arm, and another a head; and then &s;uppo&s;e me&mdash;like the man who &s;hews the tombs in We&s;t|min&s;ter abbey&mdash;about to explain their good, bad, and indifferent qualities&mdash;ju&s;t as it may &s;uit to illu&s;trate my po&s;ition; and to this man I may be aptly compared&mdash;for, like him, I have all the talk to my&s;elf, and, like him, am paid before I &s;hew any thing.</P>
<P>Very poor, however, would be my reward if it was only derived from pecuniary gratification. A warmer and more thankful &s;entiment fires my brea&s;t, no le&s;s than that as I am impelled alone by gratitude to appear before you, I may hope for your kind and gentle wi&s;hes for my &s;afety, health and pro&s;perity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I did not fini&s;h the exordium in this manner, it ran as follows&mdash;from the words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my own judgment."</Q> I &s;hall therefore pre&s;ent you with a melange; which I tru&s;t will be found to be neither regularly dull, nor ridiculou&s;ly eccentric, but a &s;ort of medium between the&s;e extremes; tend|ing &s;ometimes to provoke an involuntary &s;igh, but much oftener a &s;pontaneous &s;mile; and though I profe&s;s it to be out of all rule, cla&s;s, or di&s;tinction, yet I am &s;anguine enough to hope it will have as regular a beginning, middle, and end, as an epic poem; that it will commence with <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> be fol|lowed up with <HI>attention,</HI> and conclude with&mdash;APPROBATION.</NOTE></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To chequer the entertainment, and render it a little more lively, I thus went on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now introduce you to a &s;et of gentlemen who&s;e evenings were <HI>jovially</HI> employed in the &s;ame degree, as the mornings of CASSANDER and HORTENSIA were devoted to de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>This company con&s;i&s;ted of a PROJECTOR, who had tired the royal &s;ociety and impaired his fortune by &s;chemes that had every thing to <HI>perfect</HI> them but <HI>practicability.</HI> A SPECULATOR who had invented an in&s;trument which was to foretel the coming change of the &s;tocks, upon the principle of a barometer, but who&mdash;unfortunately tru&s;ting too far to the infallibility of his project&mdash;was obliged to <HI>waddle out.</HI> A COMMODORE, who had ri&s;en by his merit from the foreca&s;tle, and had retired in di&s;gu&s;t. A POET, who had never been able to get a play heard to the end of the fir&s;t act. A wild IRISH|MAN, who had blundered through a large patrimony fill he had nothing left&mdash;to u&s;e his own words&mdash;but the <HI>pur&s;e</HI> of a <HI>beggar</HI> and the <HI>heart</HI> of a <HI>prince.</HI> And a LEVEE HUNTER, who, in the cour&s;e of <HI>thirteen years,</HI> was <HI>once</HI> within <HI>five minutes</HI> of &s;eeing the <HI>great man him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="332">The&s;e &s;ix, grown wi&s;e from their di&s;appointments, had gathered toge|ther the &s;cattered remains of their broken fortunes, and determined to laugh away the re&s;t of their lives. Health followed them to the chace; plea&s;ure filled the teeming bowl; and the only contention at their meetings&mdash;where ANACREON might have been proud to &s;it pre&s;ident&mdash;was&mdash;who &s;hould be forwarder&s;t to promote harmle&s;s mirth and inoffen&s;ive hilarity.</P>
<P>The board being met, and a few toa&s;ts drank, the poet was called upon for a &s;ong. He &s;aid he would give them a little &s;atirical touch, which he had that morning written again&s;t a lady, who had been cruel to him. He confe&s;&s;ed it was malicious&mdash;or &s;o&mdash;but he &s;incerely believed exactly in point for all that.</P>

<P>The conver&s;ation next turned on the law&mdash;and one of the company had mentioned the frequency of executions in this country. From this the PBO|JECTOR, who was a bit of a wag, took occa&s;ion to relate the following anecdote.</P>
<P>A carpenter, who could not get his money for two gibbets that had been be&s;poke, refu&s;ed to make a third; and an execution having been in con|&s;equence delayed&mdash;the jailor being called to account&mdash;blamed the carpenter, who was at length &s;ummoned before the judge. The judge told him he had ordered the gibbet, and demanded in a very preremptory way the rea&s;on it had not been made. The carpenter, with the greate&s;t &s;implicity in nature, excu&s;ed him&s;elf by telling the truth&mdash;&s;aying&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I refu&s;ed the hangman and the jailor to make a <HI>third</HI> gibbet, becau&s;e I had not been paid for the <HI>two fir&s;t</HI>; but if I had known the gallows had been for your LORDSHIP&mdash;why lord love you it &s;hould have been <HI>done out of hand.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The POET was noticing how &s;ometimes the mo&s;t trivial and unfore&s;een accident overturns an author's hopes. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A thing,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'once happened to me which was enough to make a man for&s;wear ever taking a pen in hand.

The gentleman, d'ye &s;ee, was telling a long, roundabout rhodomontade &s;tory about fighting, which he fini&s;hed the conclu&s;ion of by &s;aying he had killed three men. I told him that his three men was nothing at all at all, a jolman in my country would kill thirteen, and eat them afterwards. I my&s;elf, &s;aid I, have had eleven duels, and kilt my man every time, and in a twelft&mdash;But, &s;aid I to the company, you &s;hall hear gentlemen. I was a &s;ad, wicked, rakehelly, young dog&mdash;played deep&mdash;dranked hard. Well Sir, I had a quarrel wid a box-lobby beau&mdash;called him out&mdash;kilt him. I did not fly, you &s;ee&mdash;I knew I had pinked a puppy, and &s;hould be thanked for it. This affair, however, being wid a fly, a gnat, a mu&s;kito, my courage was only tought a fla&s;h in the pan, and I was pre&s;ently in&s;ulted by five of the mo&s;t re&s;olute among them, dat wanted to <HI>quarrel</HI> with me. Oh to be &s;ure I was not a &s;coundrel, paltroon, and a

puppy. Oh it would have done your heart good to &s;ee me rou&s;e from my lethargy of pa&s;&s;ive endurance. I appointed them all at different times and places on the &s;ame morning&mdash;kilt 'em, and retired to the Continent. About a month afterwards, I was in a coffee-hou&s;e in France, where a great, big Swi&s;s officer, who was poring over the papers, &s;eemed extremely offended at the vacant &s;illine&s;s of a young Frenchman, who&mdash;as SHAKESPEARE &s;ays of <HI>Gratiano</HI>&mdash;was talking a great deal about nothing at all at all. Ah&mdash;&s;aid old cru&s;ty&mdash;<HI>le diable &s;oit le petit jean foutre.</HI> The young&s;ter, in a <HI>hop &s;tep</HI> and <HI>minuet jump</HI> &s;kipt up to him, and demanded, in the civile&s;t manner, who he had thought proper to honour with &s;o elegant an appellation? He was an&s;wered, <HI>Vous&mdash;Moi!&mdash;Vous&mdash;vous etes un petit jean foutre.</HI> They went out, and in ten minutes the Swi&s;s returned, in all the ea&s;y tranquillity imaginable, having killed the Frenchman. The affair became pre&s;ently the talk of the coffee-room&mdash;<HI>c'etois bien dommage mais comment faire</HI>&mdash;Mon&s;ieur <HI>avois le humeur noir.</HI> I could not help &s;aying that <HI>Mon&s;ieur's humeur noir</HI> was but a poor excu&s;e for having kilt the young man. I was a&s;ked to ex|plain my&s;elf. To be &s;ure I did not civilly comply with his reque&s;t, by knocking his Ramilee wig about. Out we went, and by as pretty a little, genteel, cunning lunge as ever made an eyelet hole&mdash;I cured Mon&s;ieur of his <HI>humeur noir,</HI> and, fait, every other care. This was my &s;eventh man; my eighth was a Dutchman, whom I was obliged to fight with knives over a table, for nothing in life only becau&s;e I happened to &s;ay by accident that their women, their &s;hips, and their pugs dogs were all ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould. My affair in ENGLAND being now pretty well blown over, I ven|tured to return; but that I might be &s;ure every thing was &s;ung, I got a friend to look out for me while I lay quiet at a lodging in DEAL."</Q></P>

Oh it cut me to the &s;oul, but I performed my part as nobly as <HI>Horatius</HI> with <HI>Cu|riatii</HI>&mdash;I kilt 'em all three.

<P>Neither the COMMODORE's remarks nor his &s;ong could do away the vein of conver&s;ation that had before taken place. Every notorious lie that could be thought of was related. One &s;aid he had heard a lawyer aver his bu&s;ine&s;s was of &s;o va&s;t and exten&s;ive a nature, that he cleared two hundred a year by only melting the wax of the chancery and other &s;eals, in the cour&s;e of his practice. This gentleman, however, was outdone by another, who &s;aid he had &s;uch a counting-hou&s;e full of clerks, that he &s;aved double that &s;um, in ink and expedition, by only leaving out tittles and da&s;hes. But the thing that &s;eemed to be be&s;t reli&s;hed was an account of a man who under|took to jump off the monument. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The fact,'</Q> &s;aid the &s;peculator who told the &s;tory, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'was as follows. One PETER WILKINS, a bi&s;cuit maker by trade, undertook to jump off the monument. He was to mount on the rails when St. PAUL's clock &s;hould &s;trike twelve, and he was to jump off at the la&s;t &s;troke. Every precaution was of cour&s;e taken to keep the poor devil from breaking his neck. Feather beds, loads of &s;traw, and woolpacks were piled upon each other to an immen&s;e height. The day came&mdash;the

&s;treets &s;eemed to be paved with faces, and the hou&s;es roofed with people. The u&s;ual accidents happened. Broken limbs, di&s;locations, fractures, and contu&s;ions were plenty. Women with children in their arms were thrown down and trod upon; while old chimney &s;tacks, tiles, and brick-bats flew about like hail. Well Sir, the moment arrived&mdash;the clock &s;truck&mdash;and hone&s;t PETER, true to his tru&s;t, mounted upon the balu&s;trades. At the la&s;t &s;troke&mdash;off he went.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIV. <HI>MORE VIVACITY AT THE EXPENCE OF ACTORS.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"<HI>For they are the ab&s;tract</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And brief chronicle of the times.</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS one anecdote naturally produces another, I at different times took the opportunity, while the club were on the &s;ubject of the theatre, to introduce tho&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>An actor who had been u&s;ed to perform <HI>tragedy</HI> and <HI>comedy</HI> indi&s;crimi|nately, was &s;ent on for BUCKINGHAM, in <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> but not being very perfect, he floundered through the part with great he&s;itation, and in much confu&s;ion. When he came to that &s;oliloquy where RICHARD leaves him with the&s;e words&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'm bu&s;y&mdash;thou trouble&s;t me&mdash;I am not in the vein"</Q> he was quite at a lo&s;s&mdash;and &s;o intimidated, that he could not catch the word from the prompter. The audience began to hi&s;s, and poor BUCKINGHAM&mdash;after the lo&s;s of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Earldom of HEREFORD"</Q>&mdash;had very nearly been pelted with rotten apples. At length he recollected that he had played HODGE in <HI>Love in a Village</HI> the night before, and feeling the &s;ituation to be exactly the &s;ame as that of BUCKINGHAM, he hollowed out&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I thought it would come to this, I'll be &s;hot if I did not."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="364">Another related an anecdote of Mrs. CHARKE, the daughter of COLLEY CIBBER. She was playing IAGO in a barn, and they were in great confu&s;ion about the difficulty of managing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the quarrel between CASSIO and RODERIGO&mdash;for which they wanted <HI>three</HI> &s;words, whereas they had among them but <HI>two.</HI> It was agreed, however, that one of them &s;hould &s;tagger into the corner, and &s;o let his &s;word fall, as if by accident, between the &s;cenes, that thus &s;he might find it, and come on to wound CASSIO.&mdash;This, however, was neglected&mdash;and &s;eeing it was impo&s;&s;ible to get a &s;word&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What the devil &s;hall I do?'</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I mu&s;t knock the fellow down.'</Q> Saying the&s;e words, &s;he ran into the dre&s;&s;ing room&mdash;which was al&s;o a bed|chamber&mdash;and catched up an old bedpo&s;t, with which &s;he ran furiou&s;ly at CASSIO, and not to be wor&s;e than her promi&s;e, laid on him pretty &s;everely. He &s;peaking mechanically, when he heard his cue&mdash;which was accompanied by a blow on the <HI>head</HI>&mdash;cried out in the words of his part&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh my LEG is cut in two."</Q></P>
<P>The company being all lovers of theatrical merit, the&s;e anecdotes in|duced them &s;eparately to hold forth in prai&s;e of tho&s;e actors or actre&s;&s;es who had been their greate&s;t favourites, and having arrived to that pitch of tenacity when no one of them would cede his opinion, the poet &s;et them to rights by &s;aying&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Gentlemen, we have all our prejudicies. I once illu&s;|trated this po&s;ition pretty &s;trongly in a fable.'</Q></P>
<P>A large company went to &s;ee a collection of various animals. A <HI>&s;oldier</HI> admired the <HI>lion,</HI> a <HI>&s;ailor</HI> the <HI>nautilus,</HI> a <HI>fine lady</HI> the <HI>o&s;trich,</HI> a <HI>courtier</HI> the <HI>jackall,</HI> and an <HI>hypocrite</HI> the <HI>hyena.</HI> A <HI>hump-backed man</HI> declared they were all fools; each, he &s;aid, might have its particular merits, but he would venture to prove, beyond contradiction, that for beauty and &s;ymmetry no <HI>animal</HI> upon the face of creation could equal the&mdash;CAMEL.</P>
<P>This reproach &s;et them all into good humour, and produced the fol|owing &s;ong from the COMMODORE.</P>

<P>YOU may remember I began my performance,</P>
<P>PART II,</P>
<P>With &s;aying&mdash;I &s;hall now diver&s;ify my entertainment by running &s;till further into eccentricity; adhering to no &s;ettled plan, but merely taking up detached &s;ubjects, u&s;hered in only by a few explanatory words.</P>
<P>The following is an extract from a piece which conveys a &s;trong gene|ral &s;atire. Tired with each other's &s;ociety, ULYSSES and CIRCE agreed to part. He entreats her, however, as the la&s;t proof of her kindne&s;s, to di&s;en|chant his companions, and &s;uffer them to accompany him to ITHACA. To this &s;he has not the &s;malle&s;t objection, provided they them&s;elves will con&s;ent. ULYSSES thinks he &s;hall not find the &s;malle&s;t difficulty to per&s;uade ASSES, BULLS, and BEARS to re&s;ume their original forms of MEN. He is, however,
<PB N="351" REF="377">
mi&s;taken; and cannot prevail on even <HI>one</HI> of his companions to exchange <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> for <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> His conver&s;ations with a WOLF who had been a LAWYER, a HOG who had been an ALDERMAN, and a BULL who had been an IRISH FORTUNE HUNTER, will elucidate this matter better.</P>

<P>Talking of LEE, they went over the old matter of his being a &s;trong ob|ject of GARRICK's <HI>envy.</HI> This brought up GEORGE GARRICK, and his at|tachment to his brother. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Have not you ob&s;erved,'</Q> &s;aid one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'how anxiou&s;ly he always attended to the minute&s;t matters that he conceived would give plea&s;ure to DAVID&mdash;in particular the nights he performed all mu&s;t be as &s;till as death&mdash;not a mou&s;e mu&s;t &s;tir&mdash;while through <HI>affection</HI> to the BROTHER and <HI>gratitude</HI> to the FRIEND, the worthy GEORGE was every where en|treating, per&s;uading, and threatening, to induce all tho&s;e who were behind the &s;cenes to be &s;ilent.

<P>In the &s;ame pantomime was a &s;cene of a whim&s;ical nature. PIERROT is left at a tavern to watch out for HARLEQUIN, who is expected there, and told he may call for what he chu&s;es. If he wants any thing to eat, he has but to &s;ay <HI>what,</HI> and they will bring it to him. If he would amu&s;e him&s;elf, he has only to &s;ay <HI>how,</HI> and he may take his choice of entertainments. And if he would chu&s;e any &s;orts of wine, he has nothing to do but &s;ay <HI>which,</HI> and they will be in&s;tantly brought to him. Having conned his le&s;&s;on, and beginning to get &s;leepy, he wi&s;hes for a little dancing and &s;inging to keep
<PB N="178" REF="404" MS="y">
him awake, and hollows out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'<HI>How!</HI>'</Q> After he had repeated this word &s;everal times, the waiter comes in, a&s;ks him if he called, and &s;ays he &s;hall be very glad to wait upon him. PIERROT repeats <Q REND="inline">'<HI>How.</HI>'</Q> The waiter an&s;wers in any way he plea&s;es. Thus the word <HI>how</HI> is played upon till PIERROT finding it procures him no amu&s;ement, changes it to <HI>what</HI>&mdash;which bawling out pretty powerfully, the waiter thinks he is affronted, and begins to apolo|gize, &s;aying, he plainly &s;ees he has mi&s;taken him, being a foreigner, but that he meant no offence. There are good and bad of all countries. PIERROT by this time tired of calling out <HI>what,</HI> has recour&s;e to his third expedient, and cries louder than ever&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why all countries,"</Q> replies the waiter. <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which,</HI>'</Q> vociferates PIERROT. At length the waiter&mdash;getting nothing from him but <HI>how&mdash;what&mdash;which</HI>&mdash;&s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why &s;urely this fellow is either mad or drunk."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which,</HI>'</Q> &s;ays PIERROT. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh damme if I know <HI>which</HI>"</Q> returns the waiter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I'll &s;wear you are either one or t'other."</Q></P>
<P>A repetition of this &s;cene, brought on an account of the plan of the pan|tomime it&s;elf. It was con&s;tructed&mdash;in the opinion of the actor who mentioned it, and who had the confidence of the poet&mdash;upon a very new and entertain|ing idea. HARLEQUIN runs away with COLUMBINE, the DOCTOR's wife, and leaves his own wife, HARLEQUINETTE, in the DOCTOR's hou&s;e. The&s;e la&s;t two, with their familiar &s;pirits, are, through the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, the pur|&s;uers&mdash;but, their power being rather inferior to that of HARLEQUIN, they obtain their wi&s;hes <HI>figuratively,</HI> but not <HI>literally.</HI> Thus HARLEQUINETTE dooms them in one place to <HI>death and de&s;truction,</HI> and the &s;cene immediately changes to an apothecary's &s;hop. In another place &s;he entreats her &s;pirits to convey them to where they will be &s;urrounded with <HI>voracious animals,</HI> and in&s;tantly they find them&s;elves at a LORD MAYOR's fea&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This pantomime I put into the hands of the Drury-lane managers a con&s;iderable while before <HI>Harlequin Junior</HI> came out at that theatre. That piece has certainly &s;ome &s;mack of mine, and as Mr. SHERIDAN &s;poke very hand&s;omely of it to me, in <HI>Great Queen-&s;treet,</HI> without mentioning its having the &s;malle&s;t &s;imilarity to any thing el&s;e, it is not unfair to conclude that it furni&s;hed them with a hint, &s;ince they did not perform my pantomime. However, I will not &s;ay it was their intention to reject it, for before I knew their po&s;itive determination&mdash;which indeed might po&s;&s;ibly have remained untold to this moment&mdash;I withdrew it my&s;elf, in conformity to my agreement at the <HI>Circus,</HI> which precluded me from getting any piece performed el&s;ewhere.</P><P>I &s;hall take this opportunity of mentioning that I &s;ent a piece to Mr. COLMAN, through the <HI>me|dium</HI> of Mr. WOODFALL, called <HI>The Wits,</HI> which was returned. From this piece a whole &s;cene was taken into the <HI>Managers in Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> almo&s;t literally. Mr. COLMAN may &s;ay&mdash;for no man, as may be &s;een by his works, has read more French authors&mdash;that the &s;cene in que&s;tion was borrowed from the FRENCH, and therefore&mdash;<HI>fair game</HI>; but it may be retorted, that it was <HI>imitated,</HI> not <HI>tran&s;lated</HI>; and though the original will furni&s;h a hint, which any body has a right to take, it is a very curious thing that two men &s;hould <HI>imitate</HI> a French author in almo&s;t the &s;ame words. Be&s;ides, the ingenuous way would have been, at the time the piece was rejected, to have given for a rea&s;on, that there was already in his hands &s;omething on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="405">They fini&s;hed the &s;ubject of the pantomime by reading two of HARLE|QUINETTE's &s;ongs, which they found to be a tolerable burle&s;que of <HI>operatical poetry.</HI> The fir&s;t ran thus:</P>

<P>Pantomimes in general were now talked about, and one of the actors gave an account of a Dutch one, upon the &s;ubject of ABRAHAM and ISAAC. ABRAHAM is on the point of offering up his &s;on, and having tied him to a &s;take, he very lei&s;urely takes out an old ru&s;ty hor&s;e pi&s;tol, and mea&s;uring &s;ix paces with great deliberation, pre&s;ents his piece, when, all of a &s;udden, he finds &s;ome wet de&s;cend into the pan and damp the powder, when, looking up, he &s;ees an angel in a certain attitude, who had cau&s;ed what he had mi&s;taken for rain. In the mid&s;t of ABRAHAM's con&s;ternation, he cries out&mdash;<HI>Der traple Abram wilt ta te youncker &s;lauken.</HI> In another &s;cene there are a number of windmills which HARLEQUIN, in the mo&s;t <HI>delicate</HI> way that can be ima|gined, <HI>&s;ets a going.</HI> Getting further into the &s;ubject of Dutch pieces, they talked of their tragedies. The famous <HI>Cid</HI> of CORNEILLE it &s;eems is cu|riou&s;ly tran&s;lated for the edification of the <HI>Mynheers.</HI> There is a well-known pa&s;&s;age in the play where the father of RODORIGO &s;timulates his &s;on to revenge, and not &s;atisfied with the a&s;&s;urance he had before given him, &s;topping him

<P>HAVING purpo&s;ely re&s;erved about forty pages for general ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall methodize them, by recapitulating very briefly tho&s;e parts of the work which may yet remain for explanation, and others, which at pre&s;ent, have probably a contradictory complexion. Al&s;o, as I have taken leave to &s;peak with &s;ome freedom, and mu&s;t of cour&s;e expect to be treated as freely in return, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e what <HI>will</HI> be &s;aid of me; and as tho&s;e &s;nar|lers, who doubtle&s;s mean not to &s;pare their critical flings, cannot, fortunately for them, <HI>bark</HI> till I am out of hearing, I mean to <HI>muzzle</HI> them before I go&mdash;and fir&s;t, as in duty bound, for the mu&s;icians.</P>

I forbid them al&s;o to publi&s;h any thing they do not write them&s;elves&mdash;to have recour&s;e to any but their own orthography&mdash;to attempt at wit&mdash;to believe they write calmly and in
<PB N="408" REF="440">
good humour, at the moment they are bur&s;ting with envy; and I require all per&s;ons whatever to pay no attention, nor give credit to any matter or thing that may be &s;et down in &s;uch critici&s;ms of the &s;aid gentlemen of the <HI>bow, reed,</HI> or <HI>finger,</HI> provided they come under the afore&s;aid prohibition. But, to &s;hew my candour and openne&s;s of conviction, I hereby &s;ub&s;cribe beforehand to all fair, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate argument, which, without &s;ubterfuge, and in plain language clearly under&s;tood by readers of all de&s;criptions, &s;hall be &s;o written as to over|turn mine.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire all <HI>gentlemen</HI> of the LAW&mdash;whether licen&s;ed or unlicen&s;ed&mdash;whe|ther they pur&s;ue <HI>unju&s;t</HI> EQUITY, or <HI>inequitable</HI> JUSTICE&mdash;whether their line be <HI>&s;windling</HI> or <HI>bankruptcy</HI>&mdash;whether they are <HI>affidavit-makers,</HI> or <HI>information hunters</HI>&mdash;whether their favourite in&s;trument of ruin be a <HI>bond,</HI> a <HI>cognovit,</HI> a <HI>warrant of attorney,</HI> a <HI>mortgage,</HI> a <HI>po&s;t obit,</HI> or <HI>an annuity</HI>&mdash;whether their nice di&s;tinctions between <HI>perjury</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e-&s;wearing,</HI> go mo&s;t to <HI>hang</HI> the INNO|CENT, or <HI>&s;ave</HI> the GUILTY&mdash;or indeed whatever legal infamy they may be mo&s;t expert in&mdash;I de&s;ire all &s;uch will abu&s;e, revile, and calumniate me where|ever they go; being well convinced that this conduct on their part will ope|rate much more to my advantage, than any thing they can &s;ay in my favour: the prai&s;e of ill men being the mo&s;t wounding of all &s;atire. And I particularly reque&s;t all manner of per&s;ons what&s;oever, if they hear of any encomiums, pa|negyrics, or any &s;ort of commendations paid me by men of the above de&s;crip|tion, that they will have the liberality to con&s;ider &s;uch encomiums, panegy|rics, or commendations, as &s;o many &s;tudied attempts to abu&s;e and injure me, and that they will, in their charitable goodne&s;s, treat them accordingly.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I beg leave to recommend my&s;elf and this work to the kind attention and good wi&s;hes of the <HI>worthy very few,</HI> who make the laws a benefit and a ble&s;&s;ing to their fellow creatures&mdash;who&s;e &s;tudy is to &s;pare, to me|diate, and to con&s;ole&mdash;who poi&s;e the balance of ju&s;tice &s;o even, that it may not <HI>incline</HI> in the e&s;timation of a &s;ingle hair while the reclined &s;word &s;leeps
<PB N="409" REF="441">
peaceably in its &s;cabbard&mdash;to all &s;uch men do I commend my&s;elf, as the only de&s;cription of characters competent to guard the lives and property of indivi|duals, and to &s;uch I entreat all manner of per&s;ons to attend, as the only court where JUSTICE and EQUITY go hand in hand, and therefore, who&s;e compe|tency to determine they and I ought to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire all managers, and their adherents, not to have the &s;malle&s;t unea|&s;ine&s;s concerning me, but to &s;leep perfectly at ea&s;e, depending upon their al|liances with the new&s;papers, to blacken and confound tho&s;e a&s;&s;ertions of mine which they cannot controvert. I advi&s;e them al&s;o not to put them&s;elves to any inconvenience concerning the &s;tyle and manner of their entertainments; but, &s;ince genius and judgment are not to be commanded, jog on in the old way, relying upon the goodnature of the Engli&s;h, and the fecundity of their own imaginations in the art of puffing. In their report of me, I court their repro|bation, upon the &s;ame principle, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on I do that of the law|yers. I de&s;ire they will indulge them&s;elves to the full extent of their wi&s;hes; and in particular, let them not fail to <HI>cut</HI> a great many JOKES, and <HI>let</HI> a great many PUNS. As to my future intentions, I would wi&s;h them to believe that I am <HI>not</HI> going to INDIA, but, on the contrary, that I &s;hall by and by &s;olicit to be received among them; and I recommend them to enjoy, in <HI>contemplation,</HI> the &s;lavery, &s;ubjection, and humiliation, which they &s;hall hereafter &s;ee me in; and to meditate the mo&s;t expedient modes of varying and continuing &s;uch treatment again&s;t the time&mdash;which I would have them flatter them&s;elves will arrive upon holding up a finger&mdash;when they &s;hall have me again in their clutches. And I entreat all and every per&s;on or per&s;ons to who&s;e knowledge this &s;ubject may come, if it &s;o happen that nothing &s;hall be advanced by way of an&s;wer to whatever I may have a&s;&s;erted, to believe&mdash;in &s;pite of the affected in|difference &s;uch conduct may &s;eem to convey&mdash;that it will be put on for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e my arguments are unan&s;werable, and becau&s;e an at|tempt to refute them, would only &s;hew the weakne&s;s of their cau&s;e, but betray that &s;ecret envy which would operate equal to a confe&s;&s;ion of the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="442">My next jubject will be the Reviewers, a few twigs of who&s;e critical rod at lea&s;t I &s;hall be able to break; and, if every writer had the &s;ame con|&s;tancy, that tremendous object, that terrific hobgoblin which men of weak minds and &s;lender intellects wor&s;hip&mdash;as Indians do the devil&mdash;out of fear, would very &s;oon appear a poor, inoffen&s;ive thing, engendered only by &s;pleni|tive ideas, and a contemplation of cobwebs in libraries.

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for your fears, becau&s;e they ari&s;e from friend&s;hip, but be a&s;&s;ured they ari&s;e from a fal&s;e view of the matter. Tell me what you think when you have read the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the REVIEWERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know by what authority you take upon you to pronounce away the good name of tho&s;e authors who come under the la&s;h of your critici&s;m, or bid others ri&s;e into fame who&s;e works have the tran|&s;cendant advantage of your decree in their favour.</P>
<P>If you are a chartered body&mdash;though I never heard of any power compe|tent to confirm &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;and have an exclu&s;ive right to exerci&s;e laws not cognizable by other courts of critici&s;m, I have only to lament that, in a country like this, there &s;hould be a literary inqui&s;ition; for as no per&s;ua&s;ion is &s;o likely to breed &s;chi&s;ms as the &s;tudy of letters, &s;o every man's opinion may, by the exerci&s;e of very &s;lender abilities, be con&s;trued into critical heterodox, for which impiety&mdash;&s;hould it really appear that he is amenable to your juri&s;|diction
<PB N="412" REF="444">&mdash;what racks and &s;low fires may not be dreaded on the fir&s;t day of every month, when you regularly celebrate your <HI>aute de &s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Being an Engli&s;hman, therefore, I call upon all others to prote&s;t&mdash;as I do my&s;elf upon this pre&s;ent occa&s;ion&mdash;again&s;t the competency of your power; having no &s;cruple to declare that, as wounding the mind is a torture of a much more exqui&s;ite nature than lacerating the body, &s;o the cruelties you practi&s;e are as reprehen&s;ible a violence on erudition, as tho&s;e of SPAIN or PORTUGAL were on religion. I know your advocates have thrown out to palliate the matter, that you wound with <HI>blunt</HI> arrows, which in my opinion is an aggravation of your inhumanity&mdash;for every body knows the <HI>keene&s;t</HI> weapon inflicts the lea&s;t pain.</P>
<P>I have often laughed at the &s;u&s;ceptibility of literary men, concerning your critici&s;ms. Some have gna&s;hed their teeth, and imputed all you have &s;aid to ENVY, which, as far as my humble judgment &s;erves me, does not appear&mdash;for, by the little I have &s;een, your temperaments are too frigid to admit of any &s;uch tingling pa&s;&s;ion. Others have been ready to bur&s;t, while they &s;wore they endured their torture with all the intrepidity and re&s;olution of primitive Americans. In &s;hort, the &s;en&s;ibility of all is in &s;ome degree wounded, and every one threatens you with a cutting an&s;wer&mdash;which he dares not write.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions, my con&s;tant advice is, not to read you at all, and then you might as well have not written at all; for if the writer him&s;elf be not hurt, the re&s;t of the world find in you only what they expected; and after your reviews have wrapt up &s;tuff, black pins, or pectoral lozenges, or been appropriated to other u&s;es&mdash;which, if they were written to mortify unfortu|nate authors, are at lea&s;t as worthy as tho&s;e for which they were de&s;igned&mdash;you are as little regarded as any other temporary ca&s;ualty, which excites our wonder to-day, and to-morrow is forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="445">Some, however, look into you upon the principle of the man who wants to be taken up&mdash;in hopes of being abu&s;ed. COLLEY CIBBER u&s;ed to tell his &s;on, that &s;o he contrived to let the world &s;peak of him, it did not matter what it &s;aid; and, as far as it relates to you, I look upon this maxim of his to be much about the fact. But, le&s;t you &s;hould imagine I affect all this carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s, in the moment I am under the keene&s;t apprehen&s;ions as to what you may chu&s;e to &s;ay relative to this TOUR, I'll put the certainty of my enjoy|ing the very tranquillity I de&s;cribe &s;o far&mdash;even beyond <HI>your</HI> power to doubt or rea&s;on away&mdash;that you &s;hall, in this in&s;tance at lea&s;t, confe&s;s&mdash;tho&s;e who re|view the imperfections of others do not always appear the mo&s;t perfect, upon a review, them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When a prejudice has taken root in an early mind, it is pretty difficult to remove it&mdash;e&s;pecially when planted by <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and &s;trengthened by <HI>experience.</HI> Eighteen years ago, I wrote a piece called <HI>The Wedding Ring,</HI> and &s;o much did I dread the reviewers, that in the mo&s;t irre&s;olute &s;tate, I walked up and down GEORGE's <HI>coffee hou&s;e,</HI> with a review in each hand, for a con&s;iderable time, without the courage to open either of them. At length, plucking up &s;pirits, I &s;neaked into the mo&s;t ob&s;cure corner I could find, and was pre&s;ently lifted into ec&s;tacy by reading, as nearly as I can remember, the following words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This piece is an imitation of <HI>Il Filo&s;ofo di Campagna.</HI> It is done into Engli&s;h by Mr. DIBDIN, who has improved on the original, and rendered it a very plea&s;ing entertainment."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;wallowed with avidity the&s;e <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"honey words,"</Q> I began to think if I were to fortunate in my fir&s;t &s;earch, that probably on a &s;econd, I &s;hould &s;till have greater rea&s;on to rejoice; and like a man who, in&s;tead of quietly pocketing the money for a twenty pound prize in the lottery, leaves it behind for a ticket which comes up a blank, I was determined to &s;tand another lite|rary chance, regardle&s;s of what might be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="446">Upon opening the other review, I found the&s;e words, or at lea&s;t perfectly the &s;en&s;e of them:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This piece, which is taken from <HI>Il Filo&s;ofo di Campagna,</HI> has very lit|tle to recommend it to the notice of the public&mdash;'tis much inferior to the original, and Mr. DIBDIN has no preten&s;ions, upon this occa&s;ion, to think him&s;elf capable of furni&s;hing an agreeable entertainment to the public."</Q></P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that this happened eighteen years ago, therefore I will not &s;wear to the <HI>letter</HI> of the&s;e articles, to the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> however I do mo&s;t peremp|torily. It had as &s;trong an effect upon me, as being introduced behind the curtain of a jugler or a puppet&s;hew-man, and &s;o completely was I in the &s;e|cret, that I made a re&s;olution, which I have ever &s;ince religiou&s;ly kept, not to read a &s;ingle review of any thing I &s;hould write from that moment. As therefore I pique my&s;elf upon acknowledging obligations, I de&s;ire you will accept my &s;incere&s;t thanks for grubbing up by the root, as it were, all tho&s;e mortifications, which on reading that abu&s;e &s;ure to be levelled&mdash;de&s;ervedly or unde&s;ervedly&mdash;at public characters, I might have felt in common with other men; for to the detection of the incon&s;i&s;tency recorded above, I owe my ne|ver having an&s;wered in my whole life a &s;ingle printed calumny, unle&s;s it has been of &s;o injurious a nature that it could not be pa&s;&s;ed over, and then I have con&s;tantly &s;igned my name.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has often been allowed that the talents for a <HI>writer</HI> and a <HI>critic</HI> are di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. If by this it be meant that the knack of finding fault is ea&s;ier than the capacity to invent and improve, the po|&s;ition is a fair one; but this would prove mere cavilling to be true critici&s;m, which I will not admit. The truth is, no man can with the proper degree of per&s;picuity, feeling, and tenderne&s;s, analyze the work of a writer, <HI>but a writer</HI>; and all tho&s;e who poach for errors, and take away imperfections with|out the ability to leave beauties in their place, are not real judges of what they arrogate a right to decide on, and con&s;equently, ought not to be entitled critics.</P>
<P>In this light perhaps the matter has not always been &s;een, and yet it is the only one which will give it its true colour. Modern critici&s;m, is like look|ing at the &s;un to di&s;cover only the <HI>&s;pots,</HI> while the <HI>&s;ervour</HI> and <HI>brilliancy</HI> of <HI>his lu&s;tre</HI> are di&s;regarded: but ought an ingenious and enlightened age to pay the effu&s;ions of &s;uch folly a moment's attention? No. Let the deci&s;ions upon works of genius come from men who po&s;&s;e&s;s congenial &s;entiments; the&s;e only are qualified for the ta&s;k, and will be mo&s;t likely to treat with candour and de|licacy that which they know the pain and labour of producing, and look with
<PB N="416" REF="448">
care and circum&s;pection before they venture to wound tho&s;e parts, in others, which, upon fair in&s;pection, they may find vulnerable in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, &s;hould per&s;onal enmity or rooted difference of opinion in|terfere, that &s;everity in place of lenity will not &s;ometimes be adopted. Men are fallible, and a bold and flowing pen is a tempting in&s;trument to accelerate the dictates of revenge; but even then, they will always remember that their antagoni&s;ts can weild the &s;ame weapon, and, for the world's improvement, 'tis well &s;uch conflicts are: the <HI>lo&s;s of victory</HI> is &s;ome triumph in a noble con|te&s;t. I know not whether KING JOHN of FRANCE, waited on by the BLACK PRINCE, is not almo&s;t at that moment as much an object of envy, as his IL|LUSTRIOUS CONQUEROR.</P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion that if literary works were to appear only before &s;uch a tribunal, the pre&s;s would be more employed, and the amendment have this operation: dawning merit would be fo&s;tered; mature abilities &s;timulated to a repetition of their exertions; and, what would be equally a public bene|fit, <HI>pretenders</HI> would be at once <HI>&s;ilenced</HI>&mdash;whereas, thanks to <HI>reviews, new&s;pa|pers,</HI> and <HI>pamphlets,</HI> men of real talents are deterred from ornamenting the world with their productions, and the dull, vapid offspring of in&s;ipidity and ignorance puffed into fame. Let me be&s;eech, therefore, all tho&s;e who read, weigh, and approve the&s;e rea&s;ons, to pre&s;cribe for them&s;elves the following &s;imple and efficient rule.</P>
<P>When any man decries a work of genius, let him be a&s;ked if he can do as well; or, if his opinions be public, let enquiry be made as to his <HI>own pro|ductions,</HI> and do not let him be credited, unle&s;s &s;omething be found equal in con&s;equence, as to every literary requi&s;ite, to the work he undertakes to cri|tici&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="449">As to pointing out mere inaccuracies, it is not more invidious and con|temptible, than it is an affront to the reader, by whom the&s;e critical gentle|men chu&s;e to act in the quality of &s;choolma&s;ter; be&s;ides, there cannot be a higher compliment to him they would affect to condemn&mdash;for it both implies that his FAULTS are <HI>trifles,</HI> and his MERIT <HI>beyond the reach of their capacity.</HI></P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations here made have this drift. I do not know that from any body a volume of this &s;ize would be more con&s;idered as a piece of con&s;um|mate arrogance than from my&s;elf; and when it is under&s;tood that I have pre|&s;umed to &s;peak plainly of popular &s;ubjects, and advanced decided &s;entiments which, were they to obtain, would go to the correction at lea&s;t of &s;everal fa|vourite follies, I know not where the clamour may &s;top. Should it be very loud, however, I &s;hall beg leave of the candid and ingenuous to enquire <HI>who</HI> are clamourous, and if it turn out to be the very men who&s;e impo&s;itions on the public are the objects of my reprehen&s;ion, every one who&s;e opinion I have a legitimate right to value, will rank on my &s;ide, and then let us &s;ee whether an army of critical malecontents will &s;tand any chance with &s;uch a phalanx.</P>
<P>Nothing in nature is &s;o ea&s;y as to find fault. <HI>Bright geniu&s;es</HI> as naturally breed <HI>critics</HI> as the <HI>&s;un</HI> engenders <HI>flies.</HI> Who has fed more grubs than Dr. JOHNSON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the&s;e was congratulating another on &s;ome recent &s;ucce&s;s, when he was an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh this is nothing at all&mdash;&s;tay till I do the Dictionary."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, &s;urely,"</Q> &s;aid the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you would not have the impudence to attack that&mdash;no, no, he's &s;afe there."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Aye! how &s;o?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why he has given the real etymology of all words from every authority he could gather."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'God,'</Q> &s;aid the critic, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I did not know that, <HI>for I never read it,</HI> but if that is the ca&s;e, it won't do, &s;ure enough&mdash;for what <HI>every body &s;ays,</HI> MUST BE TRUE.'</Q></NOTE>&mdash;therefore let the witlings take care, for they may be a&s;&s;ured, in proportion as they are abu&s;ive &s;o they will lift me into con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Yet will I, by way of caution to the judicious, &s;ay a few words. If when I am gone it &s;hould be advanced that any of my a&s;&s;ertions are fal&s;e, let
<PB N="418" REF="450">
the manner of my making them be con&s;idered, the proofs I adduce examined, and the ground of their probability looked into.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that while I reprobate critici&s;ms I arrogate the title of critic my&s;elf, thereby in&s;inuating that I have a right to rank with the only de&s;crip|tion which, according to my idea, are competent to decide on works of lite|rature, I beg to &s;ay that mine are not <HI>critici&s;ms,</HI> but mere <HI>ob&s;ervations</HI>; and that they do not go to the correction of <HI>errors,</HI> but <HI>abu&s;es.</HI> For in&s;tance: What does all I &s;ay of Mr. SHERIDAN amount to, but that he could have written and invented much better, and probably would have done &s;o, had he not conceived that if he had outgone WYCHERLY and CONGREVE, he would have been gazed at as a <HI>comet,</HI> and then lo&s;t; whereas his bu&s;ine&s;s was to move like a <HI>planet</HI> in the regular cour&s;e of periodical revolution?</P>
<P>If it be remarked that I, <HI>irregularly bred</HI>&mdash;according to my own confe&s;|&s;ion&mdash;in the &s;chool of mu&s;ic, have pre&s;umed to hold forth a rod for the cor|rection of public ta&s;te&mdash;which has been formed by the combined excellence of men who&s;e abilities have received univer&s;al admiration&mdash;let it be remembered, that I only wi&s;h to prune the luxuriant and &s;uperfluous branches off this <HI>tree of ta&s;te,</HI> and throw away the <HI>rotten</HI> and <HI>withered fruit,</HI> that &s;o it may produce <HI>vigorou&s;ly</HI> that <HI>quantity</HI> it is capable of bearing, giving it <HI>beauty, maturity,</HI> and <HI>flavour.</HI></P>
<P>My next will contain a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e matters in a lighter way; by the end of which, I &s;hall have pretty well anticipated all objections in a literary point of view&mdash;except my general errata, which I re&s;erve for the la&s;t letter but one.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been frequently con&s;idered by authors as a &s;ufficient apology for the incongruity of their works, that they were written in a hurry&mdash;which by the way is the la&s;t excu&s;e that ought to be made. Is it done to give an idea that the public will &s;wallow any thing, be it ever &s;o crude or immature?

<P>How unfortunate am I then who am obliged to offer this hacknied excu&s;e for the crudities that are to be found in this book, which has been written in a greater hurry than ever book was.

<P>To &s;peak literally, I might have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with more variety and clo&s;er accuracy than I have done; but <HI>correctne&s;s</HI> is with me a <HI>cold word,</HI> and if a revi&s;ion of any thing take away of <HI>&s;pirit</HI> more than it add of <HI>elegance,</HI> let me go into the world with whatever faults the critics can point out, &s;o that men of &s;trong feeling and candid di&s;crimination will but acknowledge in me lively fancy, decent language, poignant remark, apt epithet, and argument &s;omething like axiom.</P>
<P>As times go, the art of keeping people awake has its merit; and if I can but accompli&s;h this, I &s;hall have triumphed over many writers, and tho&s;e&mdash;not to &s;peak it profanely&mdash;that I have heard prai&s;ed too; who, believing that a man takes up a book to &s;hun his thoughts, the more effectually to obliviate them&mdash;if they, literati, will admit my expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;&s;eem as if they invented a &s;ort of literary laudanum which &s;hould &s;et him a&s;leep without an obligation to the apothecary.</P>
<P>The temperatures of all authors are not alike. Some only muddy and confound their ideas by frequent thinking&mdash;like the actor, who reproved by RICH for being imperfect on the <HI>fifty-third</HI> night of the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good God, &s;ir, would you have a man remember a thing for ever!"</Q> Others catch hold of &s;uperficial ideas which leave no perceptible trace in the mind, any more than a <HI>meteor</HI> in the air: the&s;e, though beautiful in the conception, come to nothing upon proof. They are as ab&s;urd as would be a &s;pecimen of a fine hand writing in vitriol, which would be lo&s;t upon be|ing committed to paper, and de&s;troy that which it &s;olicited to embelli&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be blamed by &s;ome for introducing &s;o much figure&mdash;but I own I love imagery; and, where de&s;cription is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;particularly in the latitude
<PB N="421" REF="453">
of epi&s;tolary writing, which it will be pretty difficult I believe to &s;quare by any rule as to its mode of language&mdash;I &s;ee no rea&s;on why this powerful literary auxiliary &s;hould not be called in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>pro&s;e</HI> as well as <HI>poetry.</HI></P>
<P>ADDISON writes on the plea&s;ures of the imagination as critically exact, and in language as correctly cha&s;te, as he introduces WILL WHIMBLE or SIR ROGER DE COVERLY's rookery&mdash;all which is perfectly laudable as far as it relates to e&s;tabli&s;hing a reputation for a ju&s;t and accurate &s;tyle; but &s;urely if he had been a little more volatile, and &s;tretched a point to have given us a glowing de&s;cription or two, on a &s;ubject &s;o full of in&s;piration, it would not have hurt, but rather lent a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that &s;ober &s;olemnity which throughout his whole writings partakes a little too much of his Spectatorial taciturnity.&mdash;But it was his way&mdash;like the gravity of the BATH audience, or CERVETTO's <HI>yawn</HI>&mdash;and this granted, 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that prai&s;e which POPE thought was meant to <HI>damn</HI>&mdash;it was &s;o faint&mdash;conveyed, or was intended to do &s;o, as warm an encomium as the frigid&mdash;or rather elegant&mdash;conception of the writer was capable of admitting.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, I think DRYDEN's pro&s;e is the be&s;t in our language&mdash;for though yet <HI>pro&s;e</HI> it has all the fire, &s;trength, and imagination of <HI>poetry.</HI>&mdash;Yet cannot I quit this &s;ubject without noticing how much I admire the won|derful ea&s;e of SWIFT.

<Q>"<HI>There I gave it her home, brother Bruin.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this moment fini&s;hed reading, for the fir&s;t time in a collected &s;tate, all the letters that are at pre&s;ent printed; and, in&s;tead of a general recapitulation of the whole matter, which I thought would be po|&s;itively nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o well is the proper connection pre&s;erved&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the manife&s;t di&s;advantages I have laboured under&mdash;that I &s;hall only have occa|&s;ion to rub off hardne&s;&s;es, and throw in &s;ome fini&s;hing touches, to make this picture have a proper roundne&s;s and harmony in its general effects.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, early in the work, that I expected to leave ENGLAND in the beginning of <HI>April</HI>&mdash;which it was certainly my firm determination to accom|pli&s;h, had it been eligibly practicable; but I will candidly declare, that when I found, &s;hould I do &s;o, I mu&s;t have gone abroad in a more unplea&s;ant way than&mdash;I thank my <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> friends&mdash;I am now likely to do, I thought I might take the liberty of altering my intention&mdash;e&s;pecially as I can now make &s;o de&s;irable an apology to tho&s;e who wi&s;h me well, which number I am &s;ure is in a multiplied &s;tate, and by <HI>no mean figure,</HI> &s;ince I have had it in my power to tell my own &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="455">It was my intention to have gone into the laws re&s;pecting the regulations of public entertainments, but as that bu&s;ine&s;s has not only been argued on in eve|ry po&s;&s;ible way, but at length taken the very form I long ago predicted it would, a further inve&s;tigation of what is pa&s;&s;ed were totally unnece&s;&s;ary; I &s;hall take the liberty, however, to offer a few words as to what may come of it, and mention how in my &s;en&s;e the matter ought to be. And fir&s;t, it would be but common policy to introduce into the new bill, how the amu&s;ements are to be regulated beyond the circle of twenty miles out of LONDON, for I can a&s;&s;ure Mr. MAINWARING that the proprietors of <HI>Theatres Royal,</HI> in the country, begin to grow very jealous of their privileges, and if they &s;hould form a mi&s;taken zeal, or&mdash;what is full as likely&mdash;with an eye to their own advantage, put down all the <HI>Unli|cen&s;ed Theatres</HI>; or indeed &s;hould any indifferent per&s;on&mdash;now the laws are explained&mdash;do &s;o for the reward, there is not an actor out of LONDON who would not &s;tarve; for it is not by the <HI>Theatres Royal,</HI> where they have a large rent, a number of &s;ervants, and heavy nightly expences to pay, but by the &s;nug, comfortable, returns, and rea&s;onable di&s;bur&s;ements, that a &s;cheme of this kind maintains it&s;elf. YORK is &s;ure to lo&s;e money, but LEEDS and WAKEFIELD never fail to bring the company up again. In &s;hort, let the matter be equalized&mdash;let men, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, who pay a &s;um of money and give &s;ecurity, have licences, which may be of various prices, ac|cording to the nature of the entertainment meant to be given. This would exclude all po&s;&s;ibility of monopoly, &s;timulate men of talents to exert them|&s;elves, and make the name of <HI>Actor</HI>&mdash;and why it &s;hould not be &s;o no man upon earth can give a &s;en&s;ible rea&s;on&mdash;RESPECTABLE. It might al&s;o ultimately contribute towards the exigencies of the &s;tate, and, by a general regulation, be made, like the amu&s;ements in FRANCE, of national con&s;equence. Mr. SHERIDAN has, I know, held out that it would not be productive, but the matter was not at that time pre&s;&s;ed, otherwi&s;e there can be no doubt but he would have &s;een to the contrary; for it can be proved, without difficulty, that public amu&s;ements would yield, as a tax, forty thou&s;and pounds a year. He has al&s;o talked lately that it would be a hard&s;hip, were the privileges of the
<PB N="424" REF="456">
TWO <HI>Theatres</HI>&mdash;as if they were guaranteed by patents to the exclu&s;ion of all others&mdash;<HI>&s;hould be trenched upon,</HI> for they are a property worth little le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and pounds. This is <HI>&s;peculatively</HI> TRUE, but <HI>&s;ub&s;tantially</HI> FALSE;&mdash;but if it were literally the fact, there is not the &s;malle&s;t equity in this mode of argument. The <HI>Royalty Theatre,</HI> or the <HI>Circus,</HI> co&s;t as large a &s;um <HI>originally</HI> as either <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> or <HI>Covent Garden Theatre</HI>; and if the <HI>wardrobe, &s;cenes,</HI> and other articles have &s;welled the property to &s;uch an im|men&s;e &s;um&mdash;which by the bye is a little extraordinary, for the la&s;t time they were put up to &s;ale one yielded but &s;ixty and the other &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds&mdash;is it <HI>money</HI> or <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> that has produced it?</P>
<P>But to a&s;k what this boa&s;ted property is worth, &s;tript of the patent, is the only way to know its intrin&s;ic value; in which ca&s;e I believe we &s;hould find, that the trappings would be about equal to the mock honours of the actor who wears them; that nine-tenths of the &s;cenes have been con&s;idered only as &s;o much &s;pare wood and canvas ever &s;ince the tragedy, opera, or pantomime they embelli&s;hed was damned, or fini&s;hed its run; and the gilt chariots, plumed caps, &s;pears, &s;hields, and all that wa&s;te of &s;pangles and gilt leather that make proce&s;&s;ions &s;tared at&mdash;thrown by to crowd up the flies, or encumber the pro|perty-room. In &s;hort, to render Mr. SHERIDAN's meaning &s;o as to make it con&s;onant to common &s;en&s;e, is to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;ays this: We had a large <HI>ideal</HI> property, which you <HI>realized,</HI> by giving us a power to exerci&s;e our trade of which that property is the <HI>working tools</HI>:&mdash;if you give the&s;e people an equal power, their property will be as large as ours&mdash;and this is not fair. Why?&mdash;Shall one merchant entreat government to prohibit the commerce of another, le&s;t he al&s;o &s;hould grow rich? No&mdash;let each do his utmo&s;t, 'tis for the general good. Thus will a laudable emulation &s;timulate them to indu&s;try, and a watchfulne&s;s over each other prevent mutual abu&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible part of the world &s;et down public amu&s;ements as ruined when Mr. SHERIDAN and Mr. HARRIS coale&s;ced, and the &s;hort time that mo|nopoly
<PB N="425" REF="457">
went on confirmed this truth &s;o &s;trongly, that it was clearly demon|&s;trable a petition for the emancipation of <HI>theatrical &s;laves</HI> would &s;oon have been full as nece&s;&s;ary as tho&s;e at pre&s;ent preferred in favour of the <HI>Africans.</HI></P>
<P>I profe&s;s to be a little <HI>au fait</HI> to this matter, and therefore it mu&s;t not to <HI>me</HI> be objected that more than two public places cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in LONDON at the &s;ame time. Have not hou&s;es, at an immen&s;e price, been purcha&s;ed to be pulled down?&mdash;has not invention been racked to prop the crazy walls and roofs of the <HI>two theatres,</HI> till they have been &s;tretched into the &s;ize of <HI>four?</HI> and has not this expence been repaid, fir&s;t by laying an additional charge on the benefits of authors and actors&mdash;which were fir&s;t &s;ixty guineas, afterwards eighty, and now an hundred&mdash;and then ten fold by the receipts of fir&s;t nights; which, as the <HI>theatre</HI> is &s;ure to fill, mu&s;t of cour&s;e pay all the expence of a fir&s;t performance, whether it &s;ucceed or not, which clearly proves the mana|ger is &s;afe, whatever may be the fate of the poor author. In fact, ten places of public entertainment might, in the metropolis, thrive, &s;upported by <HI>real merit</HI> and <HI>proper variety</HI>; for that wonderful place has grown more rich and populous every day &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent <HI>theatres.</HI> But were this to obtain, there would be an actual nece&s;&s;ity for calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men of real abilities, who will not, after the treatment they have received, lend their help without being properly rewarded&mdash;and this would overthrow the whole of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem; for it is evident the <HI>theatre</HI> can, as it is, yield money enough without the &s;malle&s;t aid of genius or ability at all.</P>
<P>There are but two things:&mdash;either let the management of <HI>theatres</HI> be con&s;idered as a traffic that every body has a right to derive a benefit from who chu&s;es to adventure in it, or let it be under&s;tood as a grant to the proprietors of <HI>two hou&s;es</HI> in LONDON, and, if you will, one in every other city or opulent town in the kingdom, who are to be con&s;idered as the purveyors of the public, and obliged, under that idea, to provide the be&s;t entertainment that can be had. How will it operate? No &s;ingle <HI>theatre</HI> in the kingdom, except tho&s;e in LONDON,
<PB N="426" REF="458">
produces the &s;malle&s;t novelty&mdash;if, therefore, performances void of merit are permitted at the <HI>two theatres,</HI> they go through the whole nation, and are &s;ure, the &s;ource being contaminated, to poi&s;on the general ta&s;te. Thus genius&mdash;for who&s;e &s;upport and encouragement <HI>theatres</HI> were &s;urely originally intended&mdash;may retire, unknown and neglected, to deplore the ingratitude of the mo&s;t benevolent country upon earth.</P>
<P>Had I time to go over the ground of e&s;tabli&s;hing theatres by purcha&s;eable licences, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of proving that it would an&s;wer every de&s;irable end to the managers, the public, and the legi&s;lature; but &s;ince at pre&s;ent, however, the &s;ubject does not &s;eem likely to take this turn, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;aying&mdash;as more cannot be meant by ve&s;ting partial powers in the hands of individuals than that &s;uch men &s;hould act in conformity with the wi&s;h, and properly provide for the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of the public&mdash;this law, like any other, &s;hould be watched, and managers laid under a re&s;triction not to reject works of acknowledged merit. For this purpo&s;e, a &s;ort of board of controul might be in&s;tituted, who &s;hould have power to take cognizance of every omi&s;|&s;ion of this kind, and let the authority of that body determine in what way pieces &s;hould be produced, &s;o as to conduce to the mutual advantage of author and manager. If it be objected that the cure is wor&s;e than the evil, it &s;elf-evidently proves, that the mea&s;ure is in it&s;elf wrong, and that the legi&s;lature, by giving an unlimitted power to managers, will check that genius it is their duty to encourage, and cheri&s;h that very licentiou&s;ne&s;s they are &s;o &s;olicitous to curb.</P>
<P>In a word, as the laws now are, a manager&mdash;either from want of prin|ciple or ability&mdash;being ab&s;olute, may exerci&s;e what tyranny he &s;hall think pro|per; I therefore hope, for the &s;ake of con&s;i&s;tency, this power will be in &s;ome way re&s;trained, if it were only for the <HI>propriety</HI> of not countenancing <HI>de&s;poti&s;m</HI> in a LAND OF FREEDOM. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. &mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING done with the theatres&mdash;to which &s;ub|ject I wi&s;h I could have allotted more room. I proceed to my ta&s;k of looking further over tho&s;e parts of the work which may need elucidation, and others that may with propriety be revived, in order to be heightened.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that I &s;hould be able to point out many errors in Mr. PATER|SON's Travelling Dictionary&mdash;which is certainly in many places incorrect. I have &s;hewn how I calculated fal&s;ely, all the way from BURY to WORCES|TER, owing to the faith I gave to that book. From HALIFAX to SHEFFIELD, which according to Mr. PATERSON is <HI>forty miles,</HI> is really no more than <HI>thirty-&s;ix</HI>; from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER, &s;aid to be <HI>forty</HI> miles, is <HI>forty-two</HI>; from MANCHESTER to LIVERPOOL, &s;et down <HI>forty</HI> miles, is but <HI>thirty-&s;ix</HI>; from LEEDS to HALIFAX, &s;aid to be <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> miles, is <HI>eighteen</HI>; from HALI|FAX to MANCHESTER, &s;et down <HI>thirty,</HI> is but <HI>twenty-eight</HI>&mdash;and indeed there are many other errors of the like kind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next take an opportunity of mentioning, which I look upon as common ju&s;tice, that long after the letter was printed containing an explana|tion
<PB N="428" REF="460">
of the bu&s;ine&s;s between Mr. DALY, the Iri&s;h manager, and my&s;elf, the note of ten pounds was paid. This however I had no notice of till I received a letter at LIVERPOOL, mentioning it, on the eighth of March la&s;t&mdash;making very nearly a twelvemonth from the time of the original tran&s;action; but I do not yet repent of noticing it in the way I have, for the pieces, which are far more valuable, are not to this moment returned.</P>
<P>At the latter end of the <HI>twenty-fir&s;t</HI> letter, I have mentioned leaving my kind friends at COLCHESTER, before I have actually been there&mdash;this aro&s;e from writing the twenty-&s;econd letter <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> Or the reader may, if he plea&s;e, believe that I purpo&s;ely left my&s;elf this opportunity of recurring to a circum&s;tance which will certainly ever furni&s;h me with grateful reflections: the fact is how|ever as I have &s;et it down.</P>
<P>I have to &s;peak of new&s;papers; and the fir&s;t thing I &s;hall &s;ay is, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee how they multiply. I remember when <HI>The Daily Adver|ti&s;er, The Public Adverti&s;er, The Gazetteer, The Ledger,</HI> and two evening papers, made up&mdash;except <HI>The Craftsman</HI> on a Saturday&mdash;the whole &s;tock of public prints in LONDON, and <HI>one,</HI> or at mo&s;t <HI>two</HI> papers <HI>in a county,</HI> contented the people in the country; and really, at that time, there was &s;omething like independent principles in the conduct of the public prints. <HI>The Morning Chronicle</HI> even outwent this, and for a few years was conducted&mdash;particularly as to theatrical &s;trictures&mdash;upon the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted and impartial plan that ever was characterized by candour and fearle&s;s truth; but, alas! what force of abilities and integrity can hold out again&s;t free tickets, countenance, atten|tion, compliments, and, in fact, an anticipation of every little plea&s;urable wi&s;h and convenience! But TROY fell, and &s;o did <HI>The Morning Chronicle</HI>&mdash;which, having fir&s;t implicitly bowed to the mandate of managers, to fini&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s, took a decided part in politics, and is now <HI>decidedly</HI>&mdash;NOWHERE. <HI>The Morning Po&s;t</HI> blazed on us at once&mdash;it attacked every thing, and &s;eared nothing&mdash;con&s;equently its popularity was very &s;oon confirmed. This paper
<PB N="429" REF="461">
is memorable for teaching adverti&s;ers how to write; and what <HI>Puff</HI> &s;ays in the <HI>Critic,</HI> has certainly its origin from the &s;uperior &s;tyle in which auctions were adverti&s;ed in <HI>The Morning Po&s;t,</HI> which &s;et every body mad for high-flown, paragraphical de&s;criptions of trifles; for, as FOOTE has it, they had as much to &s;ay upon a <HI>ribband</HI> as a RAPHAEL. The dauntle&s;s attacks, however, were its &s;taple commodity, its &s;tamina, through which it pre&s;ently grew vi|gorous and rich. At this time, thinking, I &s;uppo&s;e, that abu&s;e alone was nece&s;&s;ary to lift a public print into popularity, a &s;et of levelling gentlemen brought out <HI>The General Adverti&s;er,</HI> which to be &s;ure did deal about &s;heer mud and filth in a mo&s;t liberal&mdash;or rather illiberal&mdash;way, without regard to &s;ex, age, or condition. Having, however, forgot that the &s;atire in the <HI>Morn|ing Po&s;t</HI> was written in the &s;tyle of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> and, though very &s;evere, gave evident marks of genius, and conveyed good &s;trength of argument, they pre&s;ently found them&s;elves decried among all tho&s;e who had ability to judge, or ta&s;te to di&s;tingui&s;h. Yet, as in this country are to be found plenty of tho&s;e who love to fea&s;t now and then on a neighbour's reputation, this worthy pa|per, though full of nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant &s;currility&mdash;which accompli&s;hed quality it retains to this very day&mdash;became a great favou|rite among the lower &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>I &s;hall go through a remainder of this &s;ubject in my next letter&mdash;being the la&s;t but two on which I &s;hall trouble the public, or telling you, except pri|vately, how much I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THUS did the new&s;papers, with all the calmne&s;s and goodnature imaginable, revile, abu&s;e, and vilify each other, by mutual agreement, for a con&s;iderable time, without receiving the &s;malle&s;t interruption to their laudable endeavours.</P>
<P>At length, &s;ome of the underlings belonging to the <HI>Morning Po&s;t</HI>&mdash;headed by that renowned veteran, DOCTOR KENRICK&mdash;re&s;olving to have a <HI>Morning Po&s;t</HI> of their own, without any previous intimation, came out all of a &s;udden with a new paper under that title. This &s;cheme was as expeditiou&s;ly &s;topt, as it was ridiculou&s;ly put into practice. The malecontents however were continually fomenting di&s;putes, till thinking them&s;elves equal to the conduct of the paper without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their principal, they propo&s;ed terms of &s;eparation, which were hand&s;omely and honourably acceded to, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>The Morning Herald</HI> was the con&s;equence; which is now, without doubt&mdash;except in that virulent and di&s;graceful party heat, which &s;ome have not &s;pared to think is a convention with the <HI>Morning Po&s;t,</HI> to make both popular&mdash;is the mo&s;t brilliant paper extant: indeed how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e when, in addition to the keen and penetrating judgment and &s;olid good &s;en&s;e
<PB N="431" REF="463">
of its fabricator, it is notorious that the flower of the oppo&s;ition have at times made it the conveyance of their public &s;entiments.</P>
<P>After they had gone on in this manner for a time, gathering &s;trength&mdash;like ANTEUS by being aba&s;ed&mdash;<HI>The Univer&s;al Regi&s;ter,</HI> now called <HI>The Times,</HI> was produced, without a &s;ingle recommendation, but being printed <HI>logographically</HI>; treading however in the &s;teps, or rather edging it&s;elf into the &s;ituation of the <HI>Ledger</HI>&mdash;which paper began now to be on the decline&mdash;it cir|culated pretty well.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all came out <HI>The World</HI>&mdash;of which paper I &s;hall not &s;ay an un|kind word, if it be only for its &s;en&s;ible and &s;teady attachment to that mo&s;t noble and manly of all &s;ubjects&mdash;the virtues of THE PRINCE OF WALES. Certainly it was &s;timulated to this theme, by an act of public ju&s;tice unparalelled in the annals of any country; for is there an in&s;tance upon recordworthy equal attention to this&mdash;where the heir of &s;uch a glorious crown, with a ripened wi&s;dom and Spartan greatne&s;s of &s;oul, <HI>at twenty,</HI> preferred to &s;ee his palace in ruins, rather than his trade&s;men &s;hould go unpaid. There are no words ade|quate to the prai&s;e of &s;uch an action. Admiration mu&s;t tell it. It mu&s;t be felt&mdash;nay it <HI>is,</HI> in that uniform, heart-felt tran&s;port with which men gaze on their idol, who gave them &s;o early a proof that he is not more a <HI>munificent prince</HI>&mdash;than an HONEST MAN.</P>
<P>It would not be credited, were it not as evident as light, that these NINE papers are &s;o pampered with &s;ucce&s;s, that though adverti&s;ements&mdash;which are charged equally at the &s;tamp-office&mdash;are now rated from five and &s;ixpence to fourteen or fifteen &s;hillings, they garble <HI>what</HI> they think proper, di&s;appoint <HI>when</HI> they think proper, and adverti&s;e for <HI>whom</HI> they think proper. In &s;hort, the very end propo&s;ed in adverti&s;ing is defeated by their &s;hameful neglect, or &s;candalous perver&s;ion of what is committed to their care.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="464">This it &s;eems has rou&s;ed a number of opulent and re&s;pectable men, who having them&s;elves &s;u&s;tained great inconvenience from &s;uch kind of conduct, are now, at an immen&s;e expence, and with a &s;pirit hitherto unequalled, bring|ing out a paper to be called <HI>The Star.</HI></P>
<P>This paper will be out before what I am now writing can be read, and this TOUR will finally go to pre&s;s before this <HI>Novel He&s;perus</HI> will have made its appearance, therefore I cannot, at any rate, give more than a blind judg|ment on the bu&s;ine&s;s. It will however be fair to conclude, that the immen&s;e property the gentlemen engaged in this undertaking are able to mu&s;ter&mdash;which is an ingredient by the bye never yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the e&s;tabli&s;hers of a new public print&mdash;will certainly, if they go the right way to work, render their undertaking a very popular one. It has one novelty to recommend it, it will be publi&s;hed <HI>every evening</HI>; and if their &s;ource of intelligence be genuine, and within them&s;elves, and they can in con&s;equence anticipate the articles of the following day, it will really become a very valuable acqui&s;ition to the public. Some amendment mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly has long been wanted, and by the ea&s;ie&s;t a&s;|&s;ent in the world they may ri&s;e to the &s;ummit of their wi&s;hes&mdash;for it con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than to avoid the errors of the other daily prints, which are &s;o glaring, that it is not only tho&s;e who run may <HI>read,</HI> but tho&s;e who run may <HI>correct.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;peak of <HI>evening papers,</HI> for they are a &s;ort of moons to the others, and it would be only to <HI>reflect</HI> a <HI>reflection.</HI> In the whole, there are in LONDON&mdash;taking in the three Sunday papers&mdash;about twenty, under different titles&mdash;all which yield prodigious profit, indeed more individually, than when there were but <HI>four</HI>; which I think is a pretty conclu&s;ive proof that an increa&s;e of theatres would be proportionally productive.</P>
<P>In the country, where &s;everal fortunes have been made by new&s;papers alone, there are, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>ten</HI> for every <HI>one</HI> that was to be &s;een
<PB N="433" REF="465">
<HI>twenty-five years ago</HI>; and the &s;hort hi&s;tory of them, in general, is this: They are indefatigable to procure entertaining and u&s;eful intelligence, till they fill with adverti&s;ements, and then a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars become the editor, which are indi&s;criminately brandi&s;hed by <HI>compo&s;itors</HI> and <HI>devils,</HI> to the great annoy|ance of <HI>Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t,</HI> and the unmerciful mutilation of the <HI>St. James's Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>Some exceptions however there are to this rule, and the &s;tronge&s;t I know, by infinite degrees, is <HI>The Sheffield Regi&s;ter.</HI> I do not know how &s;oon my friend GALES may make a fortune, which ultimately mu&s;t inevitably happen, if unwearied indu&s;try, fair dealing, the world's regard, and a well &s;tocked head, as well as &s;hop, are the materials to procure it; but, let it happen when it will, I &s;hall change my good opinion of him&mdash;which is at pre&s;ent pretty &s;trongly rooted&mdash;if he &s;o far forget his patrons, the public, as to neglect them in return for their favours. I think however he will not; and &s;o much do I approve his paper, that I have made choice of it to announce what will pub|licly be known of me in future; and I here, conformably to &s;uch re&s;olution, give notice, that nothing relative to me is to be con&s;idered as authentic, but what &s;hall appear in or through the medium of <HI>The Sheffield Regi&s;ter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CVI. <HI>A GENERAL ERRATA.</HI></HEAD>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had a great mind not to write this letter; but there is &s;omething &s;o ea&s;y in me, that I may be per&s;uaded into any thing. What I am about to &s;et down, is a candid expo&s;ition of all the errors this book contains&mdash;which, being given in a new way, I may perhaps from &s;ome be credited for having committed the&s;e faults on purpo&s;e to introduce <HI>novelty,</HI> even in my very ERRATA.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on for my wi&s;h to &s;ay nothing about it was, that the ingenuous part of my readers, when they meet with a typographical mi&s;take, will have the goodne&s;s, and&mdash;what is better in the reading of a book&mdash;the <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> to be|lieve that the be&s;t &s;ub&s;titute for the improper word their invention could &s;up|ply, was the very individual expre&s;&s;ion meant by the author.</P>
<P>A &s;econd rea&s;on was, that it would really be a pity to deprive the critical fry of a little nibbling&mdash;who live upon the errors of the pre&s;s, as young trouts do upon May flies, till by and by the in&s;ects are all gone, when, &s;earching for their prey with the u&s;ual avidity, they get <HI>hooked</HI> for their pains.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="467">I had many others; but the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial was, that my mode&s;ty would become the &s;acrifice in &s;uch a trial&mdash;for if I &s;ay any thing about it at all, common ju&s;tice will oblige me to pronounce, that this book, though abound|ing with <HI>errors,</HI> is the mo&s;t PERFECT that ever was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Having &s;o far dipped into this &s;ubject as to have been guilty of an appa|rent &s;oleci&s;m, my reputation demands that I &s;hould &s;et the matter to rights; relying, therefore, on the candour of the public, I blu&s;h, and go on.</P>
<P>Nothing can controvert that a&s;&s;ertion which affirms that compari&s;on is the only criterion by which any thing ought to be judged; let it then be con|&s;idered, that when this book was fir&s;t begun I had not the &s;malle&s;t idea what form it would take; that I have been three thou&s;and miles to &s;earch for the matter with which it is furni&s;hed; that it was utterly impracticable I &s;hould my&s;elf &s;uperintend more than the fir&s;t &s;ixty-four pages; that I have not had recour&s;e to a document of any kind&mdash;not even my own letters, of which it was impo&s;&s;ible to write or keep a copy; that during the whole time, till my la&s;t arrival in TOWN, I had on my mind the weight of performing a mo&s;t laborious entertainment&mdash;perhaps four times a week; that I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of accepting a great number of invitations; that in the cour&s;e of the time I have not written &s;o few as five hundred private letters; let all this I &s;ay be put again&s;t the advantages which attend the productions of writers in general in their way to the world, and then try by what degree of compari&s;on this work is more or le&s;s perfect than any other. 'Tis CLEAR&mdash;and <HI>every</HI> reader has given it in my favour, confe&s;&s;ing, that in&s;tead of &s;o &s;mall a number of errors, 'tis wonderful there are not twenty times as many. Every reader? Yes. My friends have <HI>proclaimed</HI> it; and my enemies cur&s;ed me, bit their lips, and <HI>owned</HI> it&mdash;<HI>in &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e errors which are of the greate&s;t magnitude&mdash;but the&s;e are not typographical. The language in many places is not &s;ufficiently
<PB N="436" REF="468">
per&s;picuous, and frequently aiming at &s;trength&mdash;for I hate any thing luke|warm&mdash;I am afraid I have been now and then a little uncouth in my &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The errors of the pre&s;s are at lea&s;t two-thirds of them chargeable to me. In the fir&s;t place, I write&mdash;e&s;pecially when imagination is hard at work&mdash;a mo&s;t <HI>villainous hand</HI>; and as more than three-fourths of the copy has gone, letter after letter by the po&s;t, there was nothing for it but to print away&mdash;in doing which, Mr. GALES has proved him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no mean abilities at decyphering. But I'll go over the errors in the order they happened.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, p. 83, is a very curious one, for it de&s;cribes LIVERPOOL to be <HI>ea&s;t</HI> of LEEDS. Nine out of ten however upon reading it would have &s;aid this is an error of the pre&s;s, it &s;hould be <HI>we&s;t.</HI> P. 106, l. 18, it will ea&s;ily be credited, that I meant to &s;ay the dean and chapter of LICHFIELD were <HI>pro|vidently</HI> repairing their cathedral&mdash;and not <HI>providentially.</HI> P. 145, l. 3, dele <HI>in</HI> before <HI>conduct</HI>&mdash;for it &s;hould read, the men who conduct tho&s;e pa&s;&s;age boats. P. 158, l. 2, read, on the &s;tage&mdash;and not, on <HI>to</HI> the &s;tage. P. 169, l. 15, read POLLARD&mdash;and not HOLLAND. Same page, la&s;t line but two, dele <HI>much</HI>&mdash;and read, on being a MAN as well as a MONARCH. This ought to be &s;et right, for it is that trait of his character on which our mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign prides him&s;elf. P. 232, l. 20. Here is a mi&s;take occa&s;ioned, without a doubt, by &s;ome omi&s;&s;ion of mine. How I intended to expre&s;s my&s;elf at that moment it is to|tally out of my power at this di&s;tance of time to &s;ay, but the pa&s;&s;age will read tolerably well, if the reader will entirely omit the words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then to &s;ay that."</Q> After all, there is &s;ome whim in this kind of errata, for it looks&mdash;wholly with|out intention however&mdash;like a &s;atire on the amendments of motions in the <HI>hou&s;e of commons.</HI> P. 236, l. 5, read of a more <HI>&s;ane</HI> nature&mdash;and not <HI>&s;ape.</HI> In the letter to Mr. HARRIS, to &s;ay I did not mean to &s;ay <HI>more privater</HI>&mdash;though it might have been in the &s;tyle of &s;ome of his people, is unnece&s;&s;ary, therefore the reader will plea&s;e to dele <HI>more,</HI> and let <HI>privater</HI> &s;tand alone. P. 258, l. 2, place a <HI>comma</HI> after <HI>arguments,</HI> and put a <HI>period</HI> to <HI>theatre,</HI> l. 4. Read <HI>level,</HI>

<P>There are other errors of le&s;s note, &s;uch as <HI>&s;en&s;ecutive,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>con&s;ecu|tive&mdash;invetend,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>invented&mdash;diving,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>driving</HI>&mdash;a <HI>the</HI> to be taken out before <HI>theatre&mdash;&s;ubtel,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;ubtle&mdash;whetever,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>where|ever&mdash;&s;eviture,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;erviteur&mdash;pbojector,</HI> for <HI>projector</HI>&mdash;ABURNOT, in|&s;tead ARBUTHNOT, and perhaps a few others.</P>
<P>The pointing al&s;o has in &s;ome places altered the &s;en&s;e, and perhaps a turned letter or two will now and then be met with; in return however for all the&s;e imperfections, the work is beautifully printed; the letter is new and clean; the lines are leaded, that they may be read without confu&s;ion; and the pre&s;s|work&mdash;which is no trifle in a large publication&mdash;carefully and nearly executed. Indeed, &s;o much &s;olicitude has Mr. GALES &s;hewn in the getting out this work, and real judgment and under&s;tanding in being able to conduct it under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that he has, as u&s;ual, anticipated my prai&s;e, by letting his la|bour
<PB N="438" REF="470">
&s;peak his panegyric. I do not know what degree of influence my recom|mendation of him may have; but if his mode of treating others be equally obliging&mdash;and there is no rea&s;on to doubt it, for I am &s;ure my preten&s;ions to a preference are &s;light indeed&mdash;he will <HI>recommend</HI> HIMSELF, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is a very enviable &s;tyle of patronage.</P>
<P>Before I quit this <HI>comedy,</HI> or <HI>farce of errors,</HI> if you plea&s;e, I mu&s;t not omit to &s;et one very material matter to rights; in doing which however it will ap|pear, that we were obliged to manoeuvre now and then, and pretty ingeniou&s;ly, to get out this TOUR through the medium of the general po&s;t.</P>
<P>When I went la&s;t from SHEFFIELD to LIVERPOOL, the matter then writ|ten went no farther than Letter 44&mdash;which the reader will &s;ee is dated SHEF|FIELD, March 4. As I well knew the ho&s;pitality I &s;hould find at LIVER|POOL, on my return, and the variety of plea&s;ures that would be kindly chalked out for me, I felt my&s;elf con&s;cious that to keep pace with Mr. GALES would be no ea&s;y matter. We therefore agreed that as &s;oon as Letter 44 &s;hould be fini&s;hed, to go on upon Letter 75, which begins <HI>The Readings</HI>; as, in&s;tead of <HI>inventing,</HI> I &s;hould in that ca&s;e have nothing to do but <HI>copy.</HI> Thus we calculated that there would be a vacancy of thirty letters&mdash;a number &s;ufficient to contain all that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay on the TOUR it&s;elf, and the &s;tatement of pieces. We outreckoned our&s;elves however two ways. In the fir&s;t place, in bringing up the matter to page 307, in&s;tead of 305 or 309, we found our&s;elves entangled with an odd quarter of a &s;heet, and were thus obliged to have duplicates of the <HI>pages</HI> 307 and 308, though the <HI>matter</HI> will be found different. This will all be clearly under&s;tood by noticing that Letter 44, is dated as above SHEFFIELD, March 4, Letter 75&mdash;which begins <HI>The Readings</HI>&mdash;is dated LIVERPOOL, March 6, Letter 98&mdash;which fini&s;hes <HI>The Readings</HI>&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s dated LONDON, March 22, and Letter 45&mdash;which returns again to the main &s;ubject, is dated LONDON, March 25.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="471">The advantage of this manoeuvre, &s;uperadded to that which I have al|ready mentioned, was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed to be,</HI> that I &s;hould be able to &s;uperintend all that remainder of the work; the propo&s;ed end however was defeated&mdash;for I have not &s;een SHEFFIELD&mdash;except for about eighteen hours&mdash;&s;ince the fourth of March.</P>
<P>Another error nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned is this: letting the pages remain on the form after the matter was di&s;tributed, tho&s;e two half &s;heets which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the colating letters, 4 Q and 4 R, will be found to be the &s;ame pages, viz. 335, 336, 337, &amp; 338, though different matter. The&s;e parti|culars are mentioned merely for the information of the public, you may re|member I privately apprized you of them as we went on.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the hardne&s;&s;es I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to rub off; to which per|haps it will not be unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that as there can be no doubt but that my ab&s;ence will be immediately taken advantage of, and as it is not impo&s;&s;ible, not only that much &s;purious tra&s;h may be given out for mine, but al&s;o that my real compo&s;itions may &s;urreptitiou&s;ly get into the world, I entreat the pub|lic not to credit any declaration, either in print or otherwi&s;e, to this effect, not properly authenticated; and I al&s;o give notice, that I &s;hall have left authority behind me to pro&s;ecute all tho&s;e who &s;hall either <HI>perform</HI> or <HI>publi&s;h</HI> any com|po&s;ition of mine, without my written permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This la&s;t declaration has put it in my power to fini&s;h this letter very plea|&s;urably, by mentioning Mr. PRESTON in the Strand. I de&s;ire he will accept my public thanks for the innumerable kindne&s;&s;es I have received at his hands; and I &s;incerely hope that the mu&s;ic of <HI>Liberty Hall, Harve&s;t Home,</HI> the <HI>&s;ongs</HI> in <HI>The Readings,</HI> and the variety of other things he has liberally purcha&s;ed of me, may, by being productive to him, in &s;ome degree acquit me of &s;o large a load of obligations. To advi&s;e all per&s;ons who may have dealings in his way to ap|ply
<PB N="440" REF="472">
to him, is only a&s;king them to con&s;ider their own intere&s;t. 'Tis upon that principle I am happy to find that it has been in my power to contribute &s;ome little towards the exten&s;ion of his immen&s;e country corre&s;pondence; for I have never returned to any place where I have not been thanked for my re|commendation. In &s;hort, if a large capital, a &s;trong back, a well conducted home manufactory, the be&s;t materials, a rea&s;onable price, &s;trict fidelity, the mo&s;t minute care and attention, and a remarkable di&s;patch and punctuality, are the true requi&s;ites of an opulent and re&s;pectable man of bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. PRESTON certainly an&s;wers the de&s;cription; to which he adds&mdash;and my own feelings &s;trongly evince it&mdash;all the <HI>warmth, &s;incerity,</HI> and <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> of a <HI>faith|ful</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> FRIEND.</P>
<P>The heightening touches will come in the next letter, and fini&s;h this picture; after which it may be hung up&mdash;like of that of PRAXITILES&mdash;on <HI>the &s;econd day</HI>; when, I'll venture to &s;ay, if there be any beauties in truth, &s;ome of them will be here allowed&mdash;if it were only a repetition of tho&s;e truths which have marked me as</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Come now to that moment to which I have &s;o long looked with panting anxiety. To GARRICK it was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an awful one;"</Q> for he had every enjoyment <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his <HI>little</HI> heart could wi&s;h."</Q> He was courted, encouraged, flattered, and care&s;&s;ed; his productions were &s;hewn to all po&s;&s;ible advantage; his very foibles were objects of imitation; <HI>and all this</HI>&mdash;HE LEFT. To me it is a welcome moment; for I have had but little enjoyment&mdash;except that chearfulne&s;s of heart which has &s;o often galled my oppre&s;&s;ors. I have been envied, di&s;couraged, vilified, and traduced; obliged to &s;u&s;tain every po&s;&s;ible humiliation&mdash;while my poor attempts have been u&s;hered into the world under the mo&s;t mortifying di&s;advantages; <HI>and from all this</HI>&mdash;I EMAN|CIPATE.</P>
<P>It was with peculiar propriety that I put this re&s;olution in practice by an appeal to the public. In the cour&s;e of &s;uch a length of time I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have noticed many &s;hameful impo&s;itions. To communicate &s;uch information as might go to the <HI>detection,</HI> if not the <HI>cure</HI> of the&s;e, I conceived it my duty&mdash;as a mite of gratitude in return for the innumerable in&s;tances of kindne&s;s I have received at the hands of my liberal benefactors; and I flatter my&s;elf this

duty is di&s;charged in that proper, candid way, that actuates the feelings of all who aim at the good will of the benevolent, and can &s;mile with contemptuous di&s;regard at the malignant and unworthy.</P>
<P>I have purpo&s;ely re&s;erved this place to thank one more friend, who&s;e ex|ertions in procuring &s;ub&s;cribers for this work have been as flattering as bene|ficial to me. I have already mentioned this gentleman; for it was owing to him I am honoured with that ROYAL NOTICE which &s;o greatly di&s;tingui&s;hes the&mdash;I hope&mdash;<HI>propitious hour</HI> that, if fortune &s;mile, mu&s;t lead me to indepen|dance. His genero&s;ity however did not &s;top here; for through the medium of his application has been procured the name of almo&s;t every noble per&s;onage in my li&s;t&mdash;be&s;ides a large number of others. My only difficulty is how to thank him. He will not feel the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any merit in what he has done&mdash;for <HI>his</HI> gratification has been equal to <HI>mine</HI>&mdash;neverthele&s;s he mu&s;t not be offended if I a&s;&s;ure him, with all this philanthropy he cannot be more plea&s;ed than I am, nor more <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedly</HI>; for, when he &s;hall have taken &s;till further pains&mdash;which I know he meditates&mdash;his <HI>kind wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>unparalleled attention</HI> will be a welcomer plea&s;ure than&mdash;<HI>the advantages ari&s;ing from them.</HI></P>
<P>And now&mdash;having paid this tribute of gratitude&mdash;nothing further remains than, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly to a&s;&s;ure the public,</P>
<P>That in the pro&s;ecution of this work I have not had an unfair, an un|worthy, nor an unhand&s;ome wi&s;h to gratify; that if I have &s;poken in <HI>&s;trong language,</HI> it well became the dictates of TRUTH; and &s;o may I pro&s;per&mdash;as that cheerful, fearle&s;s, manly monitor prompts me&mdash;while I declare, that in this moment of parting from every public connection, I have not an ungenerous, nor unkind wi&s;h to any human being in the whole round of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="475">Thus, my dear friend, I commit my&s;elf to the world; and as to my particular good wi&s;hes to you, when you &s;hall have &s;ummed up the fini&s;h of every letter, and &s;een what they all amount to, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered that I &s;ub&s;cribe to the truth of the &s;um total, by a&s;&s;uring you <HI>now,</HI> that I am, as ever,</P>
