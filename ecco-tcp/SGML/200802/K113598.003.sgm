</FIGURE> CHAP. XXIV. EDWARD VI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY the eighth was &s;ucceeded on the throne by his only &s;on Edward the &s;ixth, now in the ninth year of his age. The late king in his will, which he expected would be ab&s;olute|ly obeyed, fixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his eighteenth year; and in the mean time appointed &s;ixteen executors of his will, to whom, during the miniority, he
<PB N="2" REF="4">
entru&s;ted the government of the king and kingdom. But the vanity of his aims was &s;oon di&s;covered; for the fir&s;t act of the execu|tors was to chu&s;e the earl of Hertford, who was afterwards made duke of Somer&s;et, as protector of the realm, and in him was lodg|ed all the regal power, together with a pri|vilege of naming whom he would for his privy council.</P>
<P>This was a favourable &s;ea&s;on for tho&s;e of the reformed religion; and the eyes of the late king were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than all of that per&s;ua&s;ion congratulated them&s;elves on the event. They no longer &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments, but maintained their doctrines openly, in preaching and teaching, even while the laws again&s;t them continued in full force. The protector had long been regarded as the &s;ecret parti|zan of the reformers; and, being now freed from re&s;traint, he &s;crupled not to expre&s;s his intention of correcting all the abu&s;es of the ancient religion, and of adopting &s;till more the doctrines propagated by Luther. His power was not a little &s;trengthened by his &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t an incur&s;ion of the Scotch, in which about eight hundred of their army were &s;lain; and the popularity which he gained upon this occa&s;ion, &s;econded his views in the further pro|pagation
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of the new doctrines. But the cha|racter of Somer&s;et did not &s;tand in need of the mean &s;upports of popularity acquired in this manner, as he was naturally humble, civil, affable, and courteous to the meane&s;t &s;uitor, while all his actions were directed by motives of piety and honour.</P>
<P>The protector, in his &s;chemes for advancing the reformation, had always recour&s;e to the coun&s;els of Cranmer, who; being a man of moderation and prudence, was aver&s;e to vio|lent changes, and determined to bring over the people by in&s;en&s;ible innovations to his own peculiar &s;y&s;tem. The per&s;on who op|po&s;ed with the greate&s;t authority any farther advances towards reformation, was Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who, though he had not obtained a place at the council-board, yet from his age, experience, and capacity, was regarded by mo&s;t men with &s;ome degree of veneration. Upon a general vi&s;itation of the church, which had been commanded by the primate and protector, Gardiner defended the u&s;e of images, which was now very openly attacked by the prote&s;tants; he even wrote an apology for holy water; but he particu|larly alleged, that it was unlawful to make any change in religion during the king's mi|nority.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
This oppo&s;ition of Gardiner drew on him the indignation of the council; and he was &s;ent to the Fleet pri&s;on, where he was u&s;ed with much har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity.</P>
<P>The&s;e internal regulations were in &s;ome mea&s;ure retarded by the war with Scotland, which &s;till continued to rage with &s;ome violence. But a defeat, which that nation &s;uffered at Mu&s;&s;elborough, in which above ten thou&s;and peri&s;hed in the field of battle, induced them to &s;ue for peace, in order to gain time; and the protector returned to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s of the reformation, which was as yet only be|gun. But, though he acquired great po|pularity by this expedition, he did not fail to attract the envy of &s;everal noblemen, by procuring a patent from the young king his nephew, to &s;it in parliament on the right hand of the throne, and to enjoy the &s;ame honours and privileges which had u&s;ually been granted the uncles of kings in England. However, he &s;till drove on his favourite &s;chemes of refor|mation, and gave more con&s;i&s;tency to the te|nets of the church. The cup was re&s;tored to the laity in the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper; private ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed; the king was empowered to create bi&s;hops by letters patent. Vagabonds were adjudged to be &s;laves for
<PB N="5" REF="7">
two years, and to be marked with a red hot iron; an act commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be levelled a|gain&s;t the &s;trolling prie&s;ts and friars. It was enacted al&s;o, that all who denied the king's &s;upremacy, or a&s;&s;erted the pope's, &s;hould, for the fir&s;t offence, forfeit their goods and chat|tels, and &s;uffer impri&s;onment during plea&s;ure; for the &s;econd offence they were to incur the pain of premunire, and for the third offence to be at|tainted of trea&s;on. Orders were &s;oon after i&s;|&s;ued by the council that candles &s;hould no lon|ger be carried about on Candlemas day, a&s;hes on A&s;h Wedne&s;day, or palms on Palm Sun|day. The&s;e were ancient &s;uper&s;titious prac|tices, which led to immoralities that it was thought proper to re&s;train. An order al&s;o was i&s;&s;ued for the removal of all images from the churches, an innovation which was much de&s;ired by the reformers, and which alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almo&s;t to a change of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. The people had for &s;ome time been extremely di&s;|tracted by the oppo&s;ite opinions of their preach|ers; and as they were totally incapable of judg|ing the arguments advanced on either &s;ide, and naturally regarded every thing they heard at church, as of the greate&s;t authority, much confu&s;ion and fluctuation re&s;ulted from this
<PB N="6" REF="8">
uncertainty. The council fir&s;t endeavoured to remove the inconvenience by laying &s;ome re&s;traints upon preaching; but finding this ex|pedient fail, they impo&s;ed a total &s;ilence upon preachers, which however, was removed by degrees, in proportion as the reformation gain|ed ground among the people.</P>
<P>But the&s;e innovations, evidently calculated for the good of the people, were not brought about without &s;ome &s;truggles at home, while the protector was but too bu&s;ily employed again&s;t the Scotch, who united with, and &s;e|conded by France, &s;till pu&s;hed on their inroads with unremitting animo&s;ity. Be&s;ides, there was &s;till an enemy that he had yet to fear more than any of the former; and this was his own brother, lord Thomas Seymour, the ad|miral, a man of uncommon talents, but proud, turbulent, and untractable. This no|bleman could not endure the di&s;tinction which the king had always made between him and his elder brother; &s;o that they divided the whole court and the kingdom by their oppo|&s;ite cabals and preten&s;ions. By his flattery and addre&s;s, he had &s;o in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of the queen dowager, that, forgetting her u&s;ual prudence and decency, &s;he married him immediately upon the decea&s;e of
<PB N="7" REF="9">
the late king. This match was particularly di&s;plea&s;ing to the elder brother's wife, who now &s;aw that while her hu&s;band had the pre|cedency in one place, &s;he was obliged to yield it in another. His next &s;tep was to cabal and make a party among the nobility, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his ambition. He then bribed the king's dome&s;tics to his inter|e&s;t; and young Edward frequently went to his hou&s;e, on pretence of vi&s;iting the queen. There he ingratiated him&s;elf with his &s;overeign by the mo&s;t officious a&s;&s;iduities, particularly by &s;upplying him with money to di&s;tribute a|mong his &s;ervants and favourites, without the knowledge of his governor. In the protector's ab&s;ence with the army in Scotland, he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to redouble all his arts and in&s;inua|tions; and thus obtained a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Sir William Paget perceiving the progre&s;s he daily made in the king's affection, wrote to the protector on the &s;ubject, who fini&s;hed the campaign in Scotland with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch, that he might return in time to coun|ter-work his machinations. But before he could arrive in England, the admiral had engaged in his party &s;everal of the princi|pal nobility, and had even prevailed on the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
king him&s;elf to write a letter to the two hou&s;es of parliament with his own hand, de&s;iring that the admiral might be appointed his governor; but the council being apprized of his &s;chemes, &s;ent deputies to a&s;&s;ure him, that if he did not de&s;i&s;t they would deprive him of his office, &s;end him pri&s;oner to the Tower, and pro&s;ecute him on the la&s;t act of parliament, by which he was &s;ubject to the penalty of high trea&s;on, for attempting to di&s;turb the peace of the govern|ment. It was not without &s;ome &s;evere &s;truggles within him&s;elf, and &s;ome menaces divulged a|mong his creatures, that he thought proper to &s;ubmit, and de&s;ired to be reconciled to his bro|ther. Yet he &s;till nouri&s;hed the &s;ame de&s;igns in &s;ecret; and his brother, &s;u&s;pecting his &s;in|cerity, employed &s;pies to inform him of all his private tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>But it was not in the power of per&s;ua&s;ions or menaces to &s;hake the admiral's unalterable views of ambition. His &s;pou&s;e, the queen|dowager, had died in child-bed; and this ac|cident, far from repre&s;&s;ing his &s;chemes, only &s;eemed to promote them. He made his ad|dre&s;&s;es to the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, afterwards &s;o revered by the Engli&s;h; and it is &s;aid that &s;he li&s;tened to his in&s;inuations, contrary to the will of her father, who had excluded her the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
in ca&s;e &s;he married without the con&s;ent of council. The admiral, however, it is &s;up|po&s;ed, had projects of getting over that objection; and his profe&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to give rea&s;on to believe that he intended aiming at regal authority. By promi&s;es and per&s;ua&s;ions he brought over many of the principal nobili|ty to his party; he neglected not even the mo&s;t popular per&s;ons of inferior rank; and he com|puted that he could on occa&s;ion command the &s;ervice of ten thou&s;and men among his &s;er|vants, tenants, and retainers. He had already provided arms for their u&s;e; and having en|gaged in his intere&s;ts Sir John Sharrington,<MILESTONE N="1548" UNIT="A.D."> ma&s;ter of the mint at Bri&s;tol, a very corrupt man, he flattered him&s;elf that money would not be wanting.</P>
<P>Somer&s;et being well a&s;certained of all the&s;e alarming circum&s;tances, endeavoured by every expedient that his power or his near connec|tion could &s;ugge&s;t, to draw him from his de|&s;igns. He rea&s;oned, he threatened, he heap|ed new favours upon him; but all to no pur|po&s;e. At la&s;t he re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the la&s;t dreadful remedy, and to attaint his own brother of high trea&s;on. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, and &s;ecretly advi&s;ed to it by Dudley, earl of Warwick, a wicked ambitious
<PB N="10" REF="12">
man, who expected to ri&s;e upon the downfall of the two brothers, he deprived him of his office of high-admiral and &s;igned a warrant for committing him to the Tower. Yet &s;till the protector &s;u&s;pended the blow, and &s;hewed a reluctance to ruin one &s;o nearly connected with him&s;elf: he offered once more to be &s;incerely re|conciled, and give him his life, if he was con|tented to &s;pend the remainder of his days in re|tirement and repentance. But finding him&s;elf unable to work on the inflexible temper of his brother by any methods but &s;everity, he order|ed a charge to be drawn up again&s;t him, con|&s;i&s;ting of thirty-three articles; and the whole to be brought into parliament, which was now be|come the in&s;trument by which the admini|&s;tration u&s;ually puni&s;hed their enemies. The charge being brought fir&s;t into the hou&s;e of lords, &s;everal peers, ri&s;ing up in their places, gave an account of what they knew concern|ing lord Seymour's conduct, and his criminal words and actions. There was more difficulty in managing the pro&s;ecution in the hou&s;e of commons; but upon receiving a me&s;&s;age from the king, requiring them to proceed, the bill pa&s;&s;ed in a very full hou&s;e, near four hundred voting for it, and not above nine or ten again&s;t it. The &s;entence was &s;oon after executed, by
<PB N="11" REF="13">
beheading him on Tower-Hill. His death, however, was, in general, di&s;agreeable to the nation, who con&s;idered the lord Seymour as hardly dealt with, in being condemned upon general allegations, without having an opportunity of making a defence, or con|fronting his accu&s;ers. But the chief odium fell upon the protector; and it mu&s;t be owned that there was no rea&s;on for carrying his &s;eve|rity to &s;uch a length as he did.</P>
<P>This ob&s;tacle being removed, the protector went on to reform and regulate the new &s;y&s;tem of religion, which was now become the chief concern of the nation. A committee of bi&s;hops and divines had been appointed by the coun|cil to frame a liturgy for the &s;ervice of the church; and this work was executed with great moderation, preci&s;ion, and accuracy. A law was al&s;o enacted, permitting prie&s;ts to marry; the ceremony of auricular confe&s;&s;ion, though not aboli&s;hed, was left at the di&s;cretion of the people, who were not di&s;plea&s;ed at being freed from the &s;piritual tyranny of their in&s;tructors; the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence was the la&s;t tenet of popery that was wholly abandoned by the people, as both the clergy and laity were loth to renounce &s;o miraculous a benefit, as it was a&s;&s;erted to be. However, at la&s;t, not
<PB N="12" REF="14">
only this, but all the principal opinions and prac|tices of the Catholic religion, contrary to what the &s;cripture authorizes, were aboli&s;hed; and the reformation, &s;uch as we have it, was almo&s;t entirely completed in England.<MILESTONE N="1549" UNIT="A.D."> With all the&s;e innovations the people and clergy in general acquie&s;ced; and Gardiner and Bonner, were the only per&s;ons who&s;e oppo&s;ition was thought of any weight; they were, therefore, &s;ent to the Tower, and threatened with the king's fur|ther di&s;plea&s;ure in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>But it had been well for the credit of the reformers, had they &s;topt at impri&s;onment only. They al&s;o re&s;olved to become per&s;ecutors in turn; and although the very &s;pirit of their doctrines aro&s;e from a freedom of thinking, yet they could not bear that any &s;hould controvert what they had been at &s;o much pains to e&s;tabli&s;h. A commi&s;&s;ion was granted to the primate and &s;ome others, to &s;earch after all anabapti&s;ts, heretics, or contemners of the new liturgy. Among the number of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to incur guilt upon this oc|ca&s;ion, was one Joan Boucher, commonly call|ed Joan of Kent; who was &s;o extremely ob|&s;tinate, that the commi&s;&s;ioners could gain no|thing upon her. She had maintained an ab|&s;tru&s;e metaphy&s;ical &s;entiment, that Chri&s;t, as
<PB N="13" REF="15">
man, was a &s;inful man; but as the Word he was free from &s;in, and could be &s;ubject to none of the frailties of the fle&s;h with which he was cloathed. For maintaining this doctrine, which none of them could under&s;tand, this poor ig|norant woman was condemned to be burnt to death as an heretic. The young king, who it &s;eems had more &s;en&s;e than his mini&s;ters, refu&s;|ed at fir&s;t to &s;ign the death warrant; but being at la&s;t pre&s;&s;ed by Cranmer, and vanqui&s;hed by his importunities, he reluctantly complied; de|claring, that if he did wrong, the &s;in &s;hould be on the head of tho&s;e who had per&s;uaded him to it. The primate, after making a new effort to reclaim the woman from her opinions, and finding her ob&s;tinate again&s;t all his arguments, at la&s;t committed her to the flames. Some time after, one Van Paris, a Dutchman, being accu&s;ed of an here&s;y called Ariani&s;m, was con|demned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment. He &s;uffered with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that he hugged and care&s;&s;ed the faggots that were con&s;uming him; and died exulting in his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e mea&s;ures were intended for the benefit of the nation, and in the end turn|ed out entirely to the advantage of &s;ociety; yet they were at that time attended with many in|conveniences, to which all changes, what&s;oever,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
are liable. When the mona&s;teries were &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, a prodigious number of monks were ob|liged to earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by their labour; &s;o that all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s were over&s;tocked. The lands of the mona&s;teries, al&s;o, had been formerly farmed out to the common people, &s;o as to employ a great number of hands; and the rents being moderate, they were able to maintain their families on the profits of agri|culture. But now the&s;e lands being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the nobility, the rents were rai&s;ed; and the farmers perceiving that wool was a better com|modity than corn, turned all their fields into pa&s;ture. In con&s;equence of this practice, the price of meal aro&s;e, to the un&s;peakable hard&s;hip of the lower cla&s;s of people. Be&s;ide, as few hands were required to manage a pa&s;ture farm, a great number of poor people were utterly deprived of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, while the nation was filled with murmurs and complaints again&s;t the nobility, who were con&s;idered as the &s;ources of the gene|ral calamity. To add to the&s;e complaints, the rich proprietors of lands proceeded to enclo&s;e their e&s;tates; while the tenants, regarded as an u&s;ele&s;s burthen, were expelled their habita|tions. Even cottagers, deprived of the com|mons on which they formerly fed their cattle, were reduced to mi&s;ery; and a great decay of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
people as well as a diminution of provi&s;ions, was ob&s;erved in every part of the kingdom. To add to this picture of general calamity, all the good coin of the kingdom was hoarded up or exported abroad; while a ba&s;e metal was coined at home, or imported from abroad in great abundance; and this the poor were obliged to receive in payment, but could not di&s;bur&s;e at an equal advantage. Thus an univer&s;al dif|fidence and &s;tagnation of commerce took place; and nothing but loud complaints were heard in every quarter.</P>
<P>The protector, who knew that his own pow|er was to be founded on the depre&s;&s;ion of the nobility, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the &s;ufferers. He appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to examine whe|ther the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the church-lands had ful|filled the conditions on which tho&s;e lands had been &s;old by the crown; and ordered all late enclo&s;ures to be laid open on an appointed day. As the object of this commi&s;&s;ion was very di&s;agreeable to the gentry and nobility, they called it arbitrary and illegal; while the com|mon people, fearing it would be eluded, and being impatient for redre&s;s, ro&s;e in great num|bers, and &s;ought a remedy by force of arms. The ri&s;ing began at once, in &s;everal parts of England, as if an univer&s;al con&s;piracy had
<PB N="16" REF="18">
been formed among the people. The rebels in Wilt&s;hire, were di&s;per&s;ed by Sir William Herbert; tho&s;e of Oxford and Glouce&s;ter, by lord Gray of Wilton; the commotions in Hamp&s;hire, Su&s;&s;ex, Kent, and other counties, were quieted by gentle methods; but the di&s;|orders in Devon&s;hire and Norfolk were the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, and threatened the greate&s;t danger. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e counties, the in|&s;urgents amounting to ten thou&s;and men, were headed by one Humphry Arundel, an expe|rienced &s;oldier; and they were &s;till more en|couraged by &s;ermons, which gave their revolt the air of a religious confederacy. They ac|cordingly &s;ent a &s;et of articles to court, which, in general, demanded an abolition of the &s;tatutes lately made in favour of the reformation; but the mini&s;try rejected their demands with con|tempt, at the &s;ame time offering a pardon to all that would lay down their arms and return to their habitations. But the in&s;ur|gents were now too far advanced to recede; and &s;till encouraged by the monks, who were with them they laid &s;iege to Exeter, car|rying before them cro&s;&s;es, banners, holy-wa|ter, candle&s;ticks, and other implements of their ancient &s;uper&s;tition; but the town was gal|lantly defended by the inhabitants. In the
<PB N="17" REF="19">
mean time, lord Ru&s;&s;el had been &s;ent again&s;t them with a &s;mall body of forces; and being reinforced by lord Gray and others, he attack|ed, and drove them from all their entrench|ments. Great &s;laughter was committed upon the&s;e deluded creatures, both in the action and the pur&s;uit. Arundel, their leader, and &s;everal others, were &s;ent to London, where they were condemned and executed. Many of the in|ferior &s;ort were put to death by martial law. The vicar of St. Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own &s;teeple, arrayed in his popi&s;h habits, with his beads at his girdle.</P>
<P>The &s;edition at Norfolk appeared &s;till more alarming. The in&s;urgents there a|mounted to twenty thou&s;and men; and as their forces were numerous, their demands were exorbitant. They required the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of the gentry, the placing new coun&s;el|lors about the king, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their ancient rights. One Ket, a tanner, had a&s;&s;umed the priority among them; he erected his tribunal near Norwich, under an old oak, which was termed the Oak of Reformation. He afterwards undertook the &s;iege of Nor|wich, which having reduced, he impri&s;oned the mayor, and &s;ome of the principal citizens.
<PB N="18" REF="20">
The marquis of Northampton was fir&s;t &s;ent down again&s;t them, but met with a repul&s;e; the earl of Warwick followed &s;oon after, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men, and &s;oon coming to a general engagement, put them entirely to the rout. Two thou&s;and of them fell in the fight and pur&s;uit; Ket was hanged at Nor|wich ca&s;tle, nine of his followers on the boughs of the Oak of Reformation; and the in&s;urrection, which was the la&s;t in favour of popery, was thus entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But though the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e in&s;ur|rections &s;eemed to be very favourable to the intere&s;ts of the protector, yet the authority which the earl of Warwick gained in quelling that of Norfolk, terminated in Somer&s;et's ruin. Of all the mini&s;ters, at that time in the council, Dudley, earl of Warwick, was the mo&s;t artful, ambitious, and unprincipled. Re&s;olved at any rate to po&s;&s;e&s;s the principal place under the king, he cared not what means were to be u&s;ed in acquiring it. However, unwilling to throw off the ma&s;k, he covered the mo&s;t exor|bitant views under the faire&s;t appearances. Having a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the earl of Southampton, he formed a &s;trong party in the council, who were determined to free them|&s;elves from the controul the protector a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="19" REF="21">
over them. That nobleman was, in fact, now grown obnoxious to a very prevailing party in the kingdom. He was hated by the nobles for his &s;uperior magnificence and power; he was hated by the Catholic party for his regard to the Reformation; he was di&s;liked by many for his &s;everity to his brother, be&s;ides the great e&s;tate he had rai&s;ed at the expence of the church and the crown, rendered him obnoxious to all. The palace which he was then building in the Strand, &s;erved al&s;o by its magnificence, and &s;till more by the unju&s;t methods that were taken to rai&s;e it, to expo&s;e him to the cen&s;ures of the public. The pari&s;h church of St. Mary, with three bi&s;hop's hou&s;es, were pulled down to furni&s;h ground and materials for the &s;truc|ture. Several other churches were demoli&s;h|ed, to have their &s;tones employed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and it was not without an in&s;urrec|tion, that the pari&s;hioners of St. Margaret's We&s;tmin&s;ter, prevented their church from being pulled down to make room for the new fabric.</P>
<P>The&s;e imprudences were &s;oon exaggerated and enlarged upon by Somer&s;et's enemies. They repre&s;ented him as a parricide, a &s;acrilegious tyrant, and an unju&s;t u&s;urper upon the pri|vileges of the council and the rights of the king. In con&s;equence of this, the lord St.

John, pre&s;ident of the council, the earls of War|wick, Southampton, and Arundel, with five coun&s;ellors more, met at Ely-Hou&s;e; and a&s;|&s;uming to them&s;elves the whole power of the council, began to act independent of the pro|tector,<MILESTONE N="Octob. 6. 1549."> whom they pretended to con&s;ider as the author of every public grievance. They wrote letters to the chief nobility and gentry of England, informing them of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and requiring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They &s;ent for the mayor and aldermen of London, and enjoined them to concur in their mea&s;ures, which they repre&s;ented as the only means of &s;aving the nation. The next day &s;everal others of the council joined the &s;eceding members; and the protector now began to tremble, not for his authority, but his life.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner been informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, than he &s;ent the king to Wind&s;or, and armed the inhabitants of Hampton and Wind&s;or al&s;o for his &s;ecurity. But finding that no man of rank, except Cranmer and Paget, adhered to him, and that the people did not ri&s;e at his &s;ummons, perceiving that he was in a manner de&s;erted by all, and that all re&s;i&s;tance was fruitle&s;s, he re&s;olved to apply to his enemies for pardon. This gave fre&s;h &s;trength and confidence to the par|ty

of Warwick; they a&s;&s;ured the king, with the humble&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of obedience, that their only aim was to put the council on the &s;ame footing on which it had been ordained by the will of their late &s;overeign, and to re&s;cue his authority from the hands of a man who had a&s;&s;umed all power to him&s;elf. The king, who never much cared for Somer&s;et, gave their ad|dre&s;s a favourable reception; and the protec|tor was &s;ent to the Tower, with &s;ome of his friends and partizans, among whom was Cecil, afterwards earl of Sali&s;bury. Mean while the council ordered &s;ix lords to act as governors to the king, two at a time officiating alternate|ly. It was then, for the fir&s;t time, that the earl of Warwick's ambition began to appear in full &s;plendour; he &s;et him&s;elf forward as the prin|cipal promoter of the protector's ruin, and the other members, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, permitted him to a&s;&s;ume the reins of govern|ment.</P>
<P>It was now &s;uppo&s;ed that Somer&s;et's fate was fixed, as his enemies were numerous, and the charges again&s;t him of the mo&s;t heinous nature. The chief article of which he was accu&s;ed, was his u&s;urpation of the govern|ment, and the taking all power into his own hands; &s;everal others of a &s;lighter tint were

added to invigorate this accu&s;ation, but none of them could be &s;aid to amount to the crime of high trea&s;on. In con&s;equence of the&s;e, a bill of attainder was preferred again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of lords; but Somer&s;et contrived, for this time, to elude the rigour of their &s;en|tence, by having previou&s;ly, on his knees, confe&s;&s;ed the charge before the members of the council. This confe&s;&s;ion, which he &s;ign|ed with his own hand, was alleged and read again&s;t him at the bar of the hou&s;e, who once more &s;ent a deputation to him, to know whe|ther the confe&s;&s;ion was voluntary or extorted. Somer&s;et thanked them for their candour; owned that it was his voluntary act, but &s;tre|nuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, that he had never harboured a &s;ini&s;ter thought again&s;t the king or the com|monwealth. In con&s;equence of this confe&s;|&s;ion, he was deprived of all his offices and goods, together with a great part of his landed e&s;tate, which was forfeited to the u&s;e of the crown. This fine on his e&s;tate was &s;oon after remitted by the king, and Somer&s;et once more, contrary to the expectation of all, recovered his liberty. He was even re-admitted into the council; happy for him, if his ambition had not revived with his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">The catholics were extremely elevated at the protector's fall; and they began to enter|tain hopes of a revolution in their favour. But they were mi&s;taken in their opinion of Warwick, who now took the lead, as ambi|tion was the only principle in his brea&s;t; and to that he was re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all others. He &s;oon gave in&s;tances of his di&s;regard in reli|gious points, by his permitting Gardiner to un|dergo the penalties pre&s;cribed again&s;t di&s;obe|dience. Many of the prelates, and he among the re&s;t, though they made &s;ome compliances, were &s;till addicted to their ancient communion. A re&s;olution was therefore taken to deprive them of their &s;ees; and it was thought proper to begin with him, in order to &s;trike a terror into the re&s;t. He had been now for two years in pri&s;on, for having refu&s;ed to inculcate the duty of obedience to the king during his mi|nority; and the council took this opportunity to &s;end him &s;everal articles to &s;ub&s;cribe, a|mong which was one, acknowleging the ju&s;|tice of the order for his confinement. He was likewi&s;e to own, that the king was &s;upreme head of the church; that the power of mak|ing and di&s;pen&s;ing holidays was a part of the prerogative; and that the Common Prayer Book was a godly and commendable form. Gar|diner

was willing to put his hand to all the articles, except that by which he accu&s;ed him|&s;elf, which he refu&s;ed to do, ju&s;tly perceiving that their aim was either to ruin or di&s;honour him. For this offence he was deprived of his bi&s;hopric, committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody; his books and papers were &s;eized; all company was denied him; and he was not even per|mitted the u&s;e of pen and ink. This &s;everity, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, countenanced tho&s;e which this prelate had afterwards an opportunity of retaliating when he came into power.</P>
<P>But the reformers did not &s;top here: the rapacious courtiers, never to be &s;atisfied, and giving their violence an air of zeal, deprived, in the &s;ame manner, Day, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, Heathe of Worce&s;ter, and Voi&s;y of Exeter. The bi&s;hops of Landaff, Sali&s;bury, and Co|ventry came off &s;omething more advantage|ou&s;ly, by &s;acrificing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;hare of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues. Not only the revenues of the church, but the libraries al&s;o, underwent a dreadful &s;crutiny. The libraries of We&s;tmin&s;ter and Oxford were ordered to be ran&s;acked, and purged of the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;als, legends, and other &s;uper&s;titious vo|lumes; in which &s;earch great deva&s;tation was made even in u&s;eful literature. Many vo|lumes

cla&s;ped in &s;ilver were de&s;troyed for the &s;ake of their rich bindings; many of geo|metry and a&s;tronomy were &s;uppo&s;ed to be ma|gical, and met no mercy. The univer&s;ity, unable to &s;top the fury of the&s;e barbarians, &s;ilently looked on, and trembled for its own &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Warwick was willing to indulge the nobi|lity with the&s;e humiliations of the church; and perceiving that the king was extremely attached to the reformation, he &s;uppo&s;ed that he could not make his court to the young monarch better than by a &s;eeming zeal in the cau&s;e. But he was &s;till &s;tedfa&s;tly bent on en|larging his own power; and as the la&s;t earl of Northumberland died without i&s;&s;ue or heirs, Warwick procured for him&s;elf a grant of his ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and obtained the title al&s;o of duke of Northumberland. The duke of Somer&s;et was now the only per&s;on he wi&s;h|ed to have entirely removed; for though fallen as he was by his late &s;piritle&s;s conduct, yet he &s;till pre&s;erved a &s;hare of popularity that rendered him formidable to this a&s;pirer. In|deed Somer&s;et was not always upon his guard again&s;t the arts of Northumberland; but could not help now and then bur&s;ting out into invectives, which were quickly carried to his
<PB N="26" REF="28">
&s;ecret enemy. As he was &s;urrounded by Northumberland's creatures, they took care to reveal all the de&s;igns which they had them|&s;elves fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted; and Somer&s;et &s;oon found the fatal effects of his rival's re&s;entment. He was, by Northumberland's command, arre&s;ted with many more, accu&s;ed of being his partizans; and he was, with his wife the dutche&s;s, al&s;o thrown into pri&s;on. He was now accu&s;ed of having formed a de&s;ign to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in the North; of attacking the train-bands on a mu&s;|ter day; of plotting to &s;ecure the Tower, and to excite a rebellion in London. The&s;e charges he &s;trenuou&s;ly denied; but he con|fe&s;&s;ed to one of as heinous a nature, which was, that he had laid a project for murdering Northumberland, Northampton, and Pem|broke, at a banquet, which was to be given them by lord Paget. He was &s;oon after brought to a trial before the marquis of Win|che&s;ter, who &s;at as high-&s;teward on the occa|&s;ion, with twenty-&s;even peers more, including Northumberland, Pembroke, and Northamp|ton, who were at once his judges and accu&s;ers. He was accu&s;ed with an intention to &s;ecure the per&s;on of the king, and re-a&s;&s;ume the ad|mini&s;tration of affairs, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the duke of Northumberland, and rai&s;e an in&s;urrection
<PB N="27" REF="29">
in the city. He pleaded not guilty to the fir&s;t part of the charge, and of this he was accord|ingly acquitted; but he was found guilty of con&s;piring the death of a privy-coun&s;ellor, which crime had been made felony in the reign of Henry the &s;eventh; and for this he was condemned to be hanged. The populace &s;ee|ing him re-conveyed to the Tower without the ax, which was no longer carried before him, imagined that he had been entirely ac|quitted; and in repeated &s;houts and acclama|tions manife&s;ted their joy; but this was &s;ud|denly damped, when they were better inform|ed of his doom. Care in the mean time had been taken to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the young king a|gain&s;t his uncle; and le&s;t he &s;hould relent, no acce&s;s was given to any of Somer&s;et's friends, while the prince was kept from reflection by a &s;eries of occupations and amu&s;ements. At la&s;t the pri&s;oner was brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill, where he appeared, without the lea&s;t emotion, in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t con|cour&s;e of the populace, by whom he was belov|ed. He &s;poke to them with great compo&s;ure, prote&s;ting that he had always promoted the &s;er|vice of his king, and the intere&s;ts of true re|ligion, to the be&s;t of his power. The people atte&s;ted their belief of what he &s;aid, by cry|ing
<PB N="28" REF="30">
out, <Q REND="inline">"It is mo&s;t true."</Q> An univer&s;al tumult was beginning to take place; but So|mer&s;et de&s;iring them to be &s;till, and not to in|terrupt his la&s;t meditations, but to join with him in prayer, he laid down his head, and &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of the executioner. Sir Ralph Vane, and Sir Miles Partridge, were hanged; and Sir Michael Stanhope, with Sir Thomas Arundel, were beheaded, as being his accom|plices.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more unpopular than the mea&s;ure of de&s;troying Somer&s;et, who, though many actions of his life were very ex|ceptionable, yet &s;till con&s;ulted the good of the people. The hou&s;e of commons was parti|cularly attached to him; and of this Northum|berland was very &s;en&s;ible. He therefore re|&s;olved to di&s;&s;olve that parliament, and call another that would be more ob&s;equious to his will. For this purpo&s;e he engaged the king to write circular letters to all the &s;heriffs, in which he enjoined them to chu&s;e &s;uch men as he and the privy-council &s;hould recommend. With this de&s;potic mandate the &s;heriffs im|mediately complied; and the members return|ed, fully an&s;wered Northumberland's expecta|tions. He had long aimed at the fir&s;t autho|rity; and the infirm &s;tate of the king's health
<PB N="29" REF="31">
opened the pro&s;pects to his ambition. He repre&s;ented to that young prince that his &s;i&s;ters Mary and Elizabeth, who were appointed by Henry's will to &s;ucceed in failure of direct heirs to the crown, had been both declared il|legitimate by parliament; that the queen of Scots, his aunt, &s;tood excluded by the king's will, and being an alien al&s;o, lo&s;t all right of &s;ucceeding; that as the three prince&s;&s;es were thus legally excluded, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion naturally devolved to the marchione&s;s of Dor&s;et, who&s;e next heir was the lady Jane Grey, a lady every way accompli&s;hed for government, as well by the charms of her per&s;on, as the virtues and acquirements of her mind. The king, who had long &s;ubmitted to all the politic views of this de&s;igning mini&s;ter, agreed to have the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ubmitted to council, where Nor|thumberland hoped to procure an ea&s;y concur|rence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the king's health decli|ned, the mini&s;ter laboured to &s;trengthen his own intere&s;ts and connexions. His fir&s;t aim was to &s;ecure the intere&s;ts of the marquis of Dor&s;et, father to Lady Jane Gray, by procu|ring for him the title of duke of Suffolk, which was lately become extinct. Having thus obliged this nobleman, he then propo&s;ed
<PB N="30" REF="32">
a match between his fourth &s;on, lord Guilford Dudley, and the lady Jane Gray, who&s;e inte|re&s;ts he had been at &s;o much pains to advance. Still bent on &s;preading his intere&s;ts as widely as po&s;&s;ible,<MILESTONE N="1553" UNIT="A.D."> he married his own daughter to lord Ha&s;tings; and had the&s;e marriages &s;olem|nized with all po&s;&s;ible pomp and fe&s;tivity. Mean while, Edward continued to langui&s;h; and &s;everal fatal &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption began to appear. It was hoped, however, that his youth and temperance might get the better of his di&s;orders; and from their love the people were unwilling to think him in danger. It had been remarked indeed by &s;ome, that his health was vi&s;ibly &s;een to decline, from the time that the Dudleys were brought about his per&s;on. The character of Northumberland might have ju&s;tly given &s;ome colour to &s;u&s;pi|cion; and his removing all, except his own emi&s;&s;aries, from about the king, &s;till farther encrea&s;ed the di&s;tru&s;ts of the people. Nor|thumberland, however, was no way unea&s;y at their mumurs; he was a&s;&s;iduous in his at|tendance upon the king, and profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t anxious concern for his &s;afety; but &s;till drove forward his darling &s;cheme of transfer|ring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his own daughter-in-law. The judges who were appointed to draw up
<PB N="31" REF="33">
the king's letters patent for that purpo&s;e, warmly objected to the mea&s;ure; and gave their rea&s;ons before the council. They begged that a parliament might be &s;ummoned, both to give it force, and to free its partizans from danger; they &s;aid, that the form was invalid, and would not only &s;ubject the judges who drew it, but every coun&s;ellor who &s;igned it, to the pains of trea&s;on. Northumberland could not brook their demurs; he threatened them with the dread of his authority; he called one of them a traitor, and &s;aid, that he would fight in his &s;hirt with any man on &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e, as that of the lady Jane's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A method was therefore found out of &s;creening the judges from danger, by granting them the king's pardon for what they &s;hould draw up; and at length, after much deliberation, and &s;ome re|fu&s;als, the patent for changing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was completed. Thus, by this patent, Mary and Elizabeth were &s;et a&s;ide; and the crown was &s;ettled on the heirs of the dutche&s;s of Suf|folk, for the dutche&s;s her&s;elf was contented to forego her claim.</P>
<P>Northumberland having thus far &s;ucceeded, thought phy&s;icians were no longer &s;erviceable in the king's complaint; they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by his advice; and Edward was put into the hands
<PB N="32" REF="34">
of an ignorant woman, who very confidently undertook his cure. After the u&s;e of her me|dicines, all the bad &s;ymptons encrea&s;ed to a mo&s;t violent degree; he felt a difficulty of &s;peech and breathing; his pul&s;e failed, his legs &s;welled, his colour became livid, and many other &s;ymptoms appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich, in the &s;ix|teenth year of his age, and the &s;eventh of his reign, greatly regretted by all, as his early vir|tues gave a pro&s;pect of the continuance of an happy reign.<MILESTONE N="July 6, 1553."> What were the real qualities of this young prince's heart there was no time to di&s;cover; but the cultivation of his under&s;tan|ding, if we may credit hi&s;torians, was amazing. He was &s;aid to under&s;tand the Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and Spani&s;h languages. He was ver&s;ed in logic, mu&s;ic, natural philo&s;ophy, and theology. Cardan, the extraordinary &s;cho|lar and vi&s;ionary, happening to pay a vi&s;it to the Engli&s;h court, was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at his early progre&s;s, that he extols him as a prodigy of nature. It is probable, however, that &s;o much flattery as he received would have con|tributed to corrupt him, as it had formerly corrupted his father.</P>

<P>THE death of Edward only &s;erved to prepare fre&s;h troubles for a people that had hitherto greatly &s;uffered from the depravity of their kings, or the turbulence of their nobili|ty. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne had hitherto been obtained partly by lineal de&s;cent, and partly by the aptitude for government in the per&s;on cho&s;en. Neither quite hereditary, nor
<PB N="34" REF="36">
quite elective, it had made ance&s;try the pretext of right, while the con&s;ent of the people was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport all hereditary preten&s;ions. In fact, when wi&s;ely conducted, this is the be&s;t &s;pecies of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that can be conceiv|ed, as its prevents that ari&s;tocracy, which is ever the re&s;ult of a government entirely elec|tive; and that tyranny, which is too often e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, where there is never an infringement on hereditary claims.</P>
<P>Whenever a monarch of England happened to be arbitrary, and to enlarge the prerogative, he generally con&s;idered the kingdom as his property, and not him&s;elf as a &s;ervant of the people. In &s;uch ca&s;es it was natural for him at his decea&s;e to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper, making his own will the &s;tan|dard of his &s;ubjects' happine&s;s. Henry the eighth, in conformity to this practice, made his will, in which he &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mere|ly according to his caprice. In that, Edward his &s;on was the fir&s;t nominated to &s;ucceed him; then Mary, his elde&s;t daughter, by Catharine of Spain; but with a &s;pecial mark of conde|&s;cen&s;ion, by which he would intimate her ille|gitimacy. The next that followed was Eli|zabeth, his daughter by Anne Bullen, with the &s;ame marks, intimating her illegitimacy
<PB N="35" REF="37">
al&s;o. After his own children, his &s;i&s;ter's chil|dren were mentioned; his younger &s;i&s;ter the dutche&s;s of Suffolk's i&s;&s;ue were preferred before tho&s;e of their elder &s;i&s;ter the queen of Scotland, which preference was thought by all to be neither founded in ju&s;tice, nor &s;upported by rea&s;on. This will was now, however, &s;et a&s;ide by the intrigues of Northumberland, by who&s;e advice a will was made, as we have &s;een; in fa|vour of lady Jane Gray, the dutche&s;s of Suf|folk's daughter, in prejudice of all other clai|mants. Thus, after the death of this young monarch, there were no fewer than four prin|ce&s;&s;es who could a&s;&s;ert their preten&s;ions to the crown. Mary, who was the fir&s;t upon Henry's will, but who had been declared illegitimate by an act of parliament, which was never repealed. Elizabeth was next to &s;ucceed, and though &s;he had been declared illegitimate, yet &s;he had been re&s;tored to her rights during her father's life-time. The queen of Scotland, Henry's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, was fir&s;t in right, &s;uppo&s;ing the two daugh|ters illegitimate, while lady Jane Gray might alledge the will of the late king in her own favour.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, however, only two put in their preten&s;ions to the crown. Mary relying on the ju&s;tice of her cau&s;e, and lady Jane
<PB N="36" REF="38">
upon the &s;upport of the duke of Northumber|land, her father-in-law. Mary was &s;trongly bigotted to the popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, having been bred up among church-men, and hav|ing been even taught to prefer martyrdom to a denial of belief. As &s;he had lived in continual re&s;traint, &s;he was re&s;erved and gloomy; &s;he had, even during the life of her father, the re&s;olution to maintain her &s;entiments, and re|fu&s;ed to comply with his new in&s;titutions. Her zeal had rendered her furious; and &s;he was not only blindly attached to her religious opi|nions, but even to the popi&s;h clergy who main|tained them. On the other hand, Jane Gray was &s;trongly attached to the reformers; and though yet but &s;ixteen, her judgment had at|tained to &s;uch a degree of maturity, as few have been found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. All hi&s;torians agree that the &s;olidity of her under&s;tanding, improv|ed by continual application, rendered her the wonder of her age. A&s;cham, tutor to Elizabeth, informs us, that coming once to wait upon lady Jane at her father's hou&s;e in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, he found her reading Plato's works in Greek, while all the re&s;t of the fami|ly were hunting in the Park. Upon his te&s;|tifying his &s;urprize at her &s;ituation, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him that Plato was an higher amu&s;ement to
<PB N="37" REF="39">
her than the mo&s;t &s;tudied refinements of &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure; and &s;he, in fact, &s;eemed born for philo&s;ophy, and not for ambition.</P>
<P>Such were the pre&s;ent rivals for power; but lady Jane had the &s;tart of her antagoni&s;t. Nor|thumberland now re&s;olving to &s;ecure the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, carefully concealed the death of Ed|ward, in hope of &s;ecuring the per&s;on of Mary, who, by an order of council, had been requir|ed to attend her brother during his illne&s;s; but being informed of his death, &s;he immediately prepared to a&s;&s;ert her preten&s;ions to the crown. This crafty mini&s;ter, therefore, finding that farther di&s;&s;imulation was needle&s;s, went to Sion-hou&s;e, acccompanied by the duke of Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and others of the nobility, to &s;alute lady Jane Gray, who re&s;ided there. Jane was in a great mea&s;ure ignorant of all the&s;e tran&s;actions; and it was with equal grief and &s;urprize that &s;he received intelligence of them. She &s;hed a flood of tears, appeared incon&s;olable, and it was not without the utmo&s;t difficulty that &s;he yielded to the entreaties of Northumberland, and the duke her father. At length, however, they exhorted her to con&s;ent, and next day conveyed her to the Tower, where it was then u&s;ual for the kings of England to pa&s;s &s;ome days after
<PB N="38" REF="40">
their acce&s;&s;ion. Thither al&s;o all the members of the council were obliged to attend her; and thus were in &s;ome mea&s;ure made pri&s;oners by Northumberland, who&s;e will they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of obeying. Orders were given al|&s;o for proclaiming her throughout the king|dom; but the&s;e were but very remi&s;sly obey|ed. When &s;he was proclaimed in the city, the people heard her acce&s;&s;ion made public without any &s;igns of plea&s;ure, no applau&s;e en|&s;ued, and &s;ome even expre&s;&s;ed their &s;corn and contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mary, who had retired, upon the news of the king's death, to Kenning-Hall in Norfolk, &s;ent circular letters to all the great towns and nobility in the kingdom, re|minding them of her right, and commanding them to proclaim her without delay. Having taken the&s;e &s;teps, &s;he retired to Framlingham-Ca&s;tle in Suffolk, that &s;he might be near the &s;ea, and e&s;cape to Flanders in ca&s;e of failure. But &s;he &s;oon found her affairs wear the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;pect. The men of Suffolk came to pay her their homage; and being a&s;|&s;ured by her, that &s;he would defend the laws and the religion of her predece&s;&s;or, they en|li&s;ted them&s;elves in her cau&s;e with alacrity and affection. The people of Norfolk &s;oon
<PB N="39" REF="41">
after came in; the earls of Bath, and Suffex, the elde&s;t &s;ons of lord Wharton, and lord Mor|daunt joined her; and lord Ha&s;tings, with four thou&s;and men, which were rai&s;ed to op|po&s;e her, revolted to her &s;ide. Even a fleet that had been &s;ent to lie off the coa&s;t of Suf|folk to prevent her e&s;caping, engaged in her &s;ervice; and now, but too late, Northumber|land &s;aw the deplorable end of all his &s;chemes and ambition.</P>
<P>This mini&s;ter, with the con&s;ent of the coun|cil, had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops at Newmarket, had &s;et on foot new levies in London, and ap|pointed the duke of Suffolk general of the army, that he might him&s;elf continue with, and overawe the deliberations of the council. But he was turned from this manner of managing his affairs, by con&s;idering how unfit Suffolk was to head the army; &s;o that he was obliged him&s;elf to take upon him the military command. It was now, therefore, that the council being free from his influence, and no longer dreading his imme|diate authority, began to declare again&s;t him. Arundel led the oppo&s;ition, by repre&s;ent|ing the inju&s;tice and cruelty of Northumber|land, and the exorbitancy of his ambition. Pembroke &s;econded him with declarations, that he was ready to fight all of a contrary opi|nion;
<PB N="40" REF="42">
the mayor and aldermen, who were &s;ent for, readily came into the &s;ame mea&s;ures; the people expre&s;&s;ed their approbation by &s;houts and applau&s;es; and even Suffolk him&s;elf, find|ing all re&s;i&s;tance fruitle&s;s, threw open the gates of the Tower, and joined in the general cry. Mary's claims now became irre&s;i&s;tible, in a little time &s;he found her&s;elf at the head of forty thou&s;and men; while the few who at|tended Northumberland, continued irre&s;olute; and he even feared to lead them to the en|counter.</P>
<P>Lady Jane, thus finding that all was lo&s;t, re&s;igned her royalty, which &s;he had held but ten days, with marks of real &s;atisfaction, and retired with her mother to their own habita|tion. Northumberland, al&s;o, who found his affairs de&s;perate, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tem the tide of popular oppo&s;ition, attempted to quit the kingdom; but he was prevented by the band of pen&s;ioner guards, who inform|ed him that he mu&s;t &s;tay to ju&s;tify their con|duct in being led out again&s;t their lawful &s;ove|reign. Thus circumvented on all &s;ides, his cunning was now his only re&s;ource; and he began by endeavouring to recommend him&s;elf to Mary, by the mo&s;t extravagant prote&s;ta|tions of zeal in her &s;ervice. He repaired to
<PB N="41" REF="43">
the market-place in Cambridge, and proclaim|ing her queen of England, was the fir&s;t to throw up his cap in token of joy. But he reaped no advantage from this mean duplicity; he was the next day arre&s;ted in the queen's name by the earl of Arundel, at who&s;e feet he fell upon his knees, begging protection with the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. His three &s;ons, his brother, and &s;ome more of his followers were arre&s;ted with him, and com|mitted to the Tower of London. Soon after, the lady Jane Gray, the duke of Suffolk her father, and lord Guildford Dudley her hu&s;|band, were made pri&s;oners by order of the queen, who&s;e authority was now confirmed by univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Northumberland was the fir&s;t who &s;uf|fered for oppo&s;ing her, and was the per&s;on who de&s;erved puni&s;hment the mo&s;t. When brought to his trial, he openly de&s;ired permi&s;|&s;ion to a&s;k two que&s;tions of the peers, who were appointed to &s;it on his jury; <Q REND="inline">"Whether a man could be guilty of trea&s;on, who obeyed orders given him by the council under the great &s;eal? and, whether tho&s;e who were involv|ed in the &s;ame guilt with him&s;elf, could act as his judges?"</Q> Being told that the great &s;eal of an u&s;urper was no authority; and that his
<PB N="42" REF="44">
judges were proper, as they were unimpeached, he acquie&s;ced, and pleaded guilty. At his execution, he owned him&s;elf a papi&s;t; and ex|horted the people to return to the catholic faith, as they hoped for happine&s;s and tran|quility. Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Palmer, two infamous tools of his power, &s;uf|fered with him; and the queen's re&s;entment was appea&s;ed by the lives of three men, who had forfeited them by &s;everal former crimes. Sen|tence was pronounced again&s;t lady Jane, and lord Guildford, but without any intention for the pre&s;ent of putting it in execution; the youth and innocence of the per&s;ons, neither of whom had reached their &s;eventeenth year, pleaded powerfully in their favour.</P>
<P>Mary now entered London, and with very little effu&s;ion of blood, &s;aw her&s;elf joyfully proclaimed, and peaceably &s;ettled on the throne. This was the cri&s;is of Briti&s;h happi|ne&s;s; a queen who&s;e right was the mo&s;t equit|able, in &s;ome mea&s;ure elected by the people, the ari&s;tocracy of the la&s;t reign almo&s;t wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the hou&s;e of commons by this means rein&s;tated in its ancient authority, the pride of the clergy humbled, and their vices detected, peace abroad, and unanimity at home. This was the flattering pro&s;pect of Mary's ac|ce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
but &s;oon this plea&s;ing phantom was di&s;&s;olved. Mary was moro&s;e, and a bigot; &s;he was re&s;olved to give back their former power to the clergy; and thus once more to in|volve the kingdom in all the horrors it had ju&s;t emerged from. The queen had promi&s;ed the men of Suffolk, who fir&s;t came to declare in her favour, that &s;he would &s;uffer religion to remain in the &s;ituation in which &s;he found it. This promi&s;e, however, &s;he by no means intend|ed to perform; &s;he had determined on bring|ing the &s;entiments of the people to corre&s;pond with her own; and her extreme ignorance rendered her utterly incapable of doubting her own belief, or of granting indulgence to the doubts of others. Gardiner, Bonner, Ton&s;tal, Day, Heath, and Ve&s;ey, who had been con|fined, or &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es for their catholic opi|nions, during the late reigns, were taken from pri&s;on, re-in&s;tated in their &s;ees, and their for|mer &s;entences repealed. On pretence of di&s;|couraging controver&s;y, &s;he &s;ilenced, by her prerogative, all preachers throughout Eng|land, except &s;uch as &s;hould obtain a particu|lar licence; which &s;he was previou&s;ly deter|mined to grant only to tho&s;e of her own per|&s;ua&s;ion. Men now, therefore, fore&s;aw that the Reformation was to be overturned; and though
<PB N="44" REF="46">
the queen &s;till pretended that &s;he would grant a general toleration, yet no great favour could be expected by tho&s;e who were hateful to her from inveterate prejudices.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;teps that cau&s;ed an alarm among the prote&s;tants, was the &s;evere treatment of Cranmer, who&s;e moderation, integrity, and vir|tues, had made him dear, even to mo&s;t of the catholic party. A report being &s;pread, that this prelate, in order to make his court to the queen, had promi&s;ed to officiate in the Latin &s;ervice, he drew up a declaration, in which he entirely cleared him&s;elf of the a&s;per|&s;ion indeed, but incurred what was much more terrible, the queen's re&s;entment. On the pub|lication of this paper, Cranmer was thrown into pri&s;on, and tried for the part he had act|ed, in concurring among the re&s;t of the coun|cil, to exalt lady Jane, and &s;et a&s;ide the right|ful &s;overeign. This guilt he had in fact in|curred; but as it was &s;hared with a large body of men, mo&s;t of whom were not only uncen|&s;ured, but even taken into favour; the malig|nanty of the pro&s;ecution was ea&s;ily &s;een through. Sentence of high trea&s;on was, therefore, pro|nounced again&s;t him; but it was not then exe|cuted, as this venerable man was re&s;erved for a more dreadful puni&s;hment. Shortly after,
<PB N="45" REF="47">
Peter Martyr, a German reformer, who had in the late reign been invited over to England, &s;eeing how things were likely to go, de&s;ired leave to return to his native country. But the zeal of the catholics, though he had e&s;cap|ed them, was malignantly, though harmle&s;sly, wrecked upon the body of his wife, which had been interred &s;ome years before at Oxford. It was dug up by public order, and buried in a dunghill.<MILESTONE N="159" UNIT="A.D."> The bones al&s;o of Bucer and Fa|gius, two foreign reformers, were about the &s;ame time committed to the flames at Cam|bridge. The greater part of the foreign pro|te&s;tants, took early precautions to leave the kingdom; and many of the arts and manu|factures, which they &s;ucce&s;sfully advanced, fled with them. Nor were their fears without foundation; a parliament, which the queen called &s;oon after, &s;eemed willing to concur in all her mea&s;ures; they at one blow repealed all the &s;tatutes with regard to religion, which had pa&s;&s;ed during the reign of her predece&s;&s;or: &s;o that the national religion was again placed on the &s;ame footing, on which it &s;tood at the death of Henry the eighth.</P>
<P>While religion was thus returning to its primitive abu&s;es, the queen's mini&s;ters, who were willing to &s;trengthen her power by a ca|tholic
<PB N="46" REF="48">
alliance, had been for &s;ome time look|ing out for a proper con&s;ort. The per&s;on on whom her own affections &s;eemed chiefly placed was the earl of Devon&s;hire; but that noble|man either di&s;liking her per&s;on, or having al|ready placed his affections on her &s;i&s;ter Eliza|beth, neglected all overtures to &s;uch an alli|ance. Cardinal Pole, who, though inve&s;ted with that eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, was &s;till a lay|man, and a per&s;on of high character for vir|tue, genero&s;ity, and attachment to the catho|lic religion, was next thought of. But as he was in the decline of life, the queen &s;oon dropped all thoughts of him. The per&s;on la&s;t thought of, and who &s;ucceeded, was Phi|lip, prince of Spain, and &s;on of the celebrated Charles the fifth. In order to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible any di&s;agreeable remon&s;trances from the people, the articles of marriage were drawn as favourably as po&s;&s;ible to the intere&s;ts and honour of England; and this in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;tilled the clamours that had already been begun again&s;t it. It was agreed, that though Philip &s;hould have the title of king, the ad|mini&s;tration &s;hould be entirely in the queen; that no foreigner &s;hould be capable of enjoy|ing any office in the kingdom; that no inno|vation &s;hould be made in the Engli&s;h laws,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
cu&s;toms, and privileges; that her i&s;&s;ue &s;hould inherit, together with England, Burgundy, and the Low Countries; and that if Don Carlos, Philip's &s;on by a former marriage, &s;hould die, the queen's i&s;&s;ue &s;hould then enjoy all the dominions po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the king. Such was the treaty of marriage, from which poli|ticians fore&s;aw very great changes in the &s;y&s;tem of Europe; but which in the end came to nothing, by the queen's having no i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The people, however, who did not &s;ee &s;o far, were much more ju&s;t in their &s;urmi&s;es, who &s;aw that it might be a blow to their li|berties and religion. They loudly murmured again&s;t it, and a flame of di&s;content was kindled over the whole nation. Sir Thomas Wyatt, a Roman catholic, at the head of four thou&s;and in&s;urgents, marched from Kent to Hyde Park, publi&s;hing, as he went forward, a declaration again&s;t the queen's evil coun&s;el|lors, and again&s;t the Spani&s;h match. His fir&s;t aim was to &s;ecure the Tower; <MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="A.D."> but his ra&s;hne&s;s undid him. As he marched forward through the city of London, and among the narrow &s;treets without &s;u&s;picion, care was taken by the earl of Pembroke to block up the way behind him by ditches and chains thrown a|cro&s;s, and guards placed at all the avenves to
<PB N="48" REF="50">
prevent his return. In this manner did this bold demagogue pa&s;s onward, and &s;up|po&s;ed him&s;elf now ready to reap the fruits of his undertaking, when, to his utter confu&s;ion, he found that he could neither go forward, nor yet make good his retreat. He now, therefore, perceived that the citizens, from whom he had expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would not join him; and lo&s;ing all courage in this exigency, he &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The duke of Suffolk was not le&s;s guilty al&s;o; he had been joined in a confederacy with Sir Peter Carew, to make an in&s;urrection in the counties of Kent, Warwick, and Leice&s;|ter; but his confederate's impatience engaging him to ri&s;e in arms before the day appointed, Suffolk vainly endeavoured to excite his de|pendants; but was &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the earl of Huntingdon, that he was obliged to di&s;per&s;e his followers; and being di&s;covered in his retreat was led pri&s;oner to London, where he, together with Wyatt, and &s;eventy per&s;ons more, &s;uffered by the hand of the exe|cutioner. Four hundred were conducted be|fore the queen with ropes about their necks; and falling on their knees received pardon, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">But what excited the compa&s;&s;ion of the peo|ple mo&s;t of all, was the execution of lady Jane Gray, and her hu&s;band lord Guilford Dudley, who were involved in the puni&s;hment, though not in the guilt, of this in&s;urrection. Two days after Wyatt was apprehended, lady Jane and her hu&s;band were ordered to prepare for death. Lady Jane, who had long before &s;een the threatened blow, was no way &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the me&s;&s;age, but bore it with heroic re&s;olution; and being informed that &s;he had three days to prepare, &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;o long a delay. On the day of her execu|tion her hu&s;band de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her; but this &s;he refu&s;ed, as &s;he knew the parting would be too tender for her fortitude to with|&s;tand. The place at fir&s;t de&s;igned for their execution was without the Tower; but their youth, beauty, and innocence being likely to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among the people, orders were given that they &s;hould be executed with|in the verge of the Tower. Lord Dudley was the fir&s;t that &s;uffered; and while the lady Jane was conducting to the place of execu|tion, the officers of the Tower met her, bear|ing along the headle&s;s body of her hu&s;band &s;treaming with blood, in order to be inter|red in the Tower-chapel. She looked on
<PB N="50" REF="52">
the corp&s;e for &s;ome time without any emo|tion; and then, with a &s;igh, de&s;ired them to proceed. John Gage, con&s;table of the Tower, as he led her to execution, de&s;ired her to be|&s;tow on him &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ent, which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her. She gave him her tablets, where &s;he had ju&s;t written three &s;entences on &s;eeing her hu&s;band's dead body, one in Greek, one in Latin, and one in Engli&s;h, importing, that &s;he hoped God and po&s;terity would do him and their cau&s;e ju&s;tice. On the &s;caffold &s;he made a &s;peech, in which &s;he alledged that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the crown, but the not rejecting it with &s;ufficient con&s;tancy; that &s;he had le&s;s erred through ambition than filial obedience; that &s;he wil|lingly accepted death as the only atonement &s;he could make to the injured &s;tate; and was ready by her puni&s;hment to &s;hew, that in|nocence is no plea in excu&s;e for deeds that tend to injure the community. After &s;peak|ing to this effect, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;|robed by her women, and with a &s;teady &s;erene countenance &s;ubmitted to the executioner.</P>
<P>The enemies of the &s;tate being thus &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, the theatre was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion. The queen
<PB N="51" REF="53">
being freed from apprehen&s;ions of an in&s;urrec|tion, began by a&s;&s;embling a parliament, which upon this, as upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, &s;eemed only met to give countenance to her various &s;everities. The nobles, who&s;e only religion was that of the prince who governed, were ea&s;ily gained over; and the hou&s;e of commons had long been pa&s;&s;ive under all the variations of regal caprice. But there was a new enemy &s;tarted up again&s;t the reformers in the per&s;on of the king, who, though he took all po&s;&s;ible care to conceal his aver&s;ion, yet &s;ecretly influ|enced the queen, and enflamed all her pro|ceedings. Philip had for &s;ome time been come over; and had u&s;ed every endeavour to encrea&s;e that &s;hare of power which he had been allowed by parliament, but without ef|fect. The queen, indeed, who loved him with a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s that &s;at but ill on a per&s;on of her years and di&s;agreeable per&s;on, endea|voured to plea&s;e him by every conce&s;&s;ion &s;he could make or procure; and finding her&s;elf incapable of &s;atisfying his ambition, &s;he was not remi&s;s in concurring with his zeal; &s;o that heretics began to be per&s;ecuted with inqui&s;i|torial &s;everity.<MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="A.D."> The old &s;anguinary laws were now revived, which had been rejected by a former parliament. Orders were given that
<PB N="52" REF="54">
the bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts who had married &s;hould be ejected, that the ma&s;s &s;hould be re&s;tored, that the pope's authority &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that the church and its privileges, all but their goods and e&s;tates, &s;hould be put upon the &s;ame foundation on which they were be|fore the commencement of the reformation. As the gentry and nobles had already divided the church-lands among them, it was thought inconvenient, and indeed impo&s;&s;ible, to make a re&s;toration of the&s;e.</P>
<P>At the head of tho&s;e who drove &s;uch mea|&s;ures forward were Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, and cardinal Pole, who was now re|turned from Italy. Pole, who was nearly al|lied by birth to the royal family, had al|ways con&s;cientiou&s;ly adhered to the catholic religion, and had incurred Henry's di&s;plea|&s;ure, not only by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to his mea|&s;ures, but by writing again&s;t him. It was for this adherence that he was cheri&s;hed by the pope, and now &s;ent over to England as legate from the holy &s;ee. Gardiner was a man of a very different character; his chief aim was to plea&s;e the reigning prince, and he had &s;hewn already many in&s;tances of his prudent confor|mity. He now perceived that the king and queen were for rigorous mea&s;ures; and he
<PB N="53" REF="55">
knew that it would be the be&s;t means of pay|ing his court to them, even to out-go them in &s;everity. Pole, who had never varied in his principles, declared in favour of toleration; Gardiner, who had often changed, was for puni&s;hing tho&s;e changes in others with the ut|mo&s;t rigour. However, he was too prudent to appear at the head of a per&s;ecution in per|&s;on; he therefore con&s;igned that odious of|fice to Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, a cruel, brutal, and ignorant man.</P>
<P>This bloody &s;cene began by the martyrdom of Hooper, bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, and Ro|gers, prebendary of St. Paul's. They were examined by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the queen, with the chancellor at the head of them. It was expected by their recantation that they would bring tho&s;e opinions into di&s;|repute which they had &s;o long inculcated; but the per&s;ecutors were deceived; they both con|tinued &s;tedfa&s;t in their belief, and they were accordingly condemned to be burnt, Rogers in Smithfield, and Hooper in his own dioce&s;e at Glouce&s;ter. Rogers, be&s;ide the care of his own pre&s;ervation, lay under very power|ful temptations to deny his principles, and &s;ave his life, for he had a wife whom he ten|derly loved, and ten children; but nothing
<PB N="54" REF="56">
could move his re&s;olution. Such was his &s;e|renity after condemnation, that the jailors, we are told, waked him from a &s;ound &s;leep upon the approach of the hour appointed for his execution. He de&s;ired to &s;ee his wife before he died; but Gardiner told him that being a prie&s;t he could have no wife. When the fag|gots were placed around him, he &s;eemed no way daunted at the preparation; but cried out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I re&s;ign my life with joy in te&s;timony of the doctrine of Je&s;us."</Q>
When Hooper was tied to the &s;take a &s;tool was &s;et before him with the queen's pardon upon it, in ca&s;e he &s;hould relent; but he ordered it to be re|moved, and prepared chearfully to &s;uffer his &s;entence, which was executed in its full &s;e|verity. The fire, either from malice or ne|glect, had not been &s;ufficiently kindled; &s;o that his legs and thighs were fir&s;t burned, and one of his hands dropped off, while with the other he continued to beat his brea&s;t. He was three quarters of an hour in torture, which he bore with inflexible con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Sanders and Taylor, two other clergymen, who&s;e zeal had been di&s;tingui&s;hed in carrying on the reformation, were the next that &s;uf|fered. Taylor was put into a pitch-barrel; and before the fire was kindled, a faggot from
<PB N="55" REF="57">
an unknown hand was thrown at his head, which made it &s;tream with blood. Still, how|ever, he continued undaunted &s;inging the thirty-fir&s;t p&s;alm in Engli&s;h, which one of the &s;pectators ob&s;erving, &s;truck him a blow on the &s;ide of the head, and commanded him to pray in Latin. Taylor continued a few mi|nutes &s;ilent with his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed up|ward, when one of the guards, either through impatience or compa&s;&s;ion, &s;truck him down with his halbert, and thus happily put an end to his torments.</P>
<P>The death of the&s;e only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the &s;avage appetite of the popi&s;h bi&s;hops and monks, for fre&s;h &s;laughter. Bonner, bloated at once with rage and luxury, let loo&s;e his vengeance without re&s;traint; and &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in the pains of the unhappy &s;ufferers; while the queen, by her letters, ex|horted him to pur&s;ue the pious work without pity or interruption. Soon after, in obe|dience to her commands, Ridley, bi&s;hop of London; and the venerable Latimer, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, were condemned together. Rid|ley had been one of the able&s;t champions for the reformation; his piety, learning, and &s;oli|dity of judgment, were admired by his friends, and dreaded by his enemies. The night be|fore
<PB N="56" REF="58">
his execution, he invited the mayor of Ox|ford and his wife to &s;ee him; and when he beheld them melted into tears, he him&s;elf ap|peared quite unmoved, inwardly &s;upported and comforted in that hour of agony. When he was brought to the &s;take to be burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there before him. Of all the prelates of that age, Latimer was the mo&s;t remarkable for his unaffected piety, and the &s;implicity of his manners. He had never learned to flatter in courts; and his open re|buke was dreaded by all the great, who at that time too much de&s;erved it. His &s;ermons, which remain to this day, &s;hew that he had much learning, and much wit; and there is an air of &s;incerity running through them, not to be found el&s;ewhere. When Ridley began to comfort his ancient friend; Latimer, on his part, was as ready to return the kind office. <Q REND="inline">"Be of good cheer, brother, cried he, we &s;hall this day kindle &s;uch a torch in England, as I tru&s;t in God, &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed."</Q> A furious bigot a&s;cended to preach to them and the people, while the fire was preparing; and Rid|ley gave a mo&s;t &s;erious attention to his di&s;|cour&s;e. No way di&s;tracted by the prepara|tions about him, he heard him to the la&s;t; and then told him, that he was ready to an&s;wer all

that he had preached upon, if he were permitted a &s;hort indulgence; but this was refu&s;ed him. At length fire was &s;et to the pile: Latimer was &s;oon out of pain, but Ridley continued to &s;uffer much longer, his legs being con&s;umed before the fire reached his vitals.</P>
<P>One Thomas Haukes, when conducted to the &s;take, had agreed with his friends, that if he found the torture &s;upportable, he would make them a &s;ignal for that purpo&s;e in the mid&s;t of the flames. His zeal for the cau&s;e in which he &s;uffered was &s;o &s;trong, that when the &s;pectators thought him near expiring, by &s;tretching out his arms, he gave his friends the &s;ignal that the pain was not too great to be borne. This example, with many others of the like con&s;tancy, encouraged multitudes not only to &s;uffer, but even to a&s;pire after mar|tyrdom.</P>
<P>But women &s;eemed per&s;ecuted with as much &s;everity even as men. A woman in Guern&s;ey, condemned for here&s;y, was delivered of a child in the mid&s;t of the flames. Some of the &s;pec|tators, humanely ran to &s;natch the infant from danger; but the magi&s;trate, who was a papi&s;t, ordered it to be flung in again, and there it was con&s;umed with the mother.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">Cranmer's death followed &s;oon after, and &s;truck the whole nation with horror. This prelate, whom we have &s;een acting &s;o very con&s;picuous a part in the reformation, during the two preceding reigns, had been long de|tained a pri&s;oner, in con&s;equence of his imput|ed guilt in ob&s;tructing the queen's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. But it was now re&s;olved to bring him to puni&s;hment; and to give it all its ma|lignity, the queen ordered that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed for here&s;y, rather than for trea&s;on. He was accordingly cited by the pope, to &s;tand his trial at Rome; and though he was kept a pri&s;oner at Oxford, yet upon his not appear|ing, he was condemned as contumacious. But his enemies were not &s;atisfied with his tortures, without adding to them the poignancy of &s;elf-accu&s;ation. Per&s;ons were, therefore, employed to tempt him by flattery and in&s;inuation; by giving him hopes of once more being received into favour, to &s;ign his recantation, by which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal &s;upremacy and the real pre&s;ence. His love of life prevailed. In an unguarded moment he was induced to &s;ign this paper; and now his enemies, as we are told of the devil, after hav|ing rendered him completely wretched, re&s;olv|ed to de&s;troy him. But it was determined be|fore
<PB N="59" REF="61">
they led him out to execution, that they &s;hould try to induce him to make a recanta|tion in the church before the people. The un|fortunate prelate, either having a &s;ecret inti|mation of their de&s;ign, or having once more re|covered the native vigour of his mind, entered the church, prepared to &s;urprize the whole au|dience by a contrary declaration. Being placed in a con&s;picuous part of the church, a &s;ermon was preached by Cole, provo&s;t of Eaton, in which he magnified Cranmer's conver&s;ion as the immediate work of heaven it&s;elf. He a&s;|&s;ured the archbi&s;hop, that nothing could have been &s;o plea&s;ing to God, the queen, or the people; he comforted him, that in ca&s;e it was thought fit he &s;hould &s;uffer, that numberle&s;s dirges and ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;aid for his &s;oul; and that his own confe&s;&s;ion of his faith would &s;till more &s;ecure his &s;oul from the pains of purgatory. During this whole rhap&s;ody, Cran|mer expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t agony, anxiety, and internal agitation; he lifted up his eyes to heaven, he &s;hed a torrent of tears, and groan|ed with unutterable angui&s;h. He then began a prayer, filled with the mo&s;t pathetic expre&s;|&s;ions of horror and remor&s;e: he then &s;aid he was well apprized of his duty to his &s;ove|reign; but that a &s;uperior duty, the duty which
<PB N="60" REF="62">
he owed his Maker, obliged him to declare that he had &s;igned a paper contrary to his con|&s;cience: that he took this opportunity of at|toning for his error, by a &s;incere and open re|cantation; he was willing, he &s;aid, to &s;eal with his blood that doctrine, which he firmly believed to be communicated from heaven; and that as his hand had erred, by betraying his heart, it &s;hould undergo the fir&s;t puni&s;hment. The a&s;|&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of papi&s;ts, who hoped to triumph in the la&s;t words of &s;uch a con|vert, were equally confounded and incen&s;ed at this declaration. They called aloud to him to leave off di&s;&s;embling; and led him forward amid&s;t the in&s;ults and reproaches of his au|dience, to the &s;take at which Latimer and Rid|ley had &s;uffered. He was re&s;olved to triumph over their in&s;ults by his con&s;tancy and forti|tude; and the fire beginning to be kindled round him, he &s;tretched forth his right-hand, and held it in the flames till it was con&s;um|ed, while he frequently cried out, in the mid&s;t of his &s;uerings, <Q REND="inline">"That unworthy hand;"</Q> at the &s;ame time exhibiting no appearance of pain or di&s;order. When the fire attacked his body, he &s;eemed to be quite in&s;en&s;ible of his tortures; his mind was occupied wholly upon the hopes of a future reward. After his body was de&s;troyed, his heart
<PB N="61" REF="63">
was found entire; an emblem of the con&s;tan|cy with which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;ecutions were now become odious to the whole nation; and, as it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, the perpetrators of them were all willing to throw the odium from them&s;elves upon others. Philip, &s;en&s;ible of the hatred which he mu&s;t incur upon this occa&s;ion, endea|voured to remove the reproach from him&s;elf by a very gro&s;s artifice. He ordered his con|fe&s;&s;or to deliver in his pre&s;ence a &s;ermon in favour of toleration; but Bonner in his turn would not take the whole of the blame, and retorted the &s;everities upon the court. In fact, a bold &s;tep was taken to introduce a court &s;imilar to that of the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition, that &s;hould be empowered to try heretics, and condemn them without any other form of law but its own authority. But even this was thought a method too dilatory in the pre&s;ent exigence of affairs. A proclamation i&s;&s;ued again&s;t books of here&s;y, trea&s;on, and &s;edition decla|red, that who&s;oever having &s;uch books in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion did not burn them without reading, &s;hould be e&s;teemed rebels, and &s;uffer accord|ingly. This, as might be expected, was at|tended with bloody effects, whole crowds were executed, till even at la&s;t the very magi&s;|trates,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
who had been in&s;trumental in the&s;e cruelties, at la&s;t refu&s;ed to lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It was computed, that during this per&s;ecution, two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even per&s;ons &s;uffer|ed by fire, be&s;ides tho&s;e puni&s;hed by impri&s;on|ment, fines, and confi&s;cations. Among tho&s;e who &s;uffered by fire were five bi&s;hops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four trade&s;men, one hundred hu&s;bandmen, fifty-five women, and four children.</P>
<P>All this was terrible; and yet the temporal affairs of the kingdom did not &s;eem to be more &s;ucce&s;sful. From Philip's fir&s;t arrival in England the queen's pregnacy was talked of; and her own extreme de&s;ire that it &s;hould be true, induced her to favour the report. When Pole, the pope's legate, was fir&s;t intro|duced to her, &s;he fancied the child &s;tirred in her womb; and this her flatterers compared to the leaping of John the Bapti&s;t in his mo|ther's belly, at the &s;alutation of the Virgin. The catholics were confident that &s;he was preg|nant; they were confident that this child &s;hould be a &s;on; they were even confident that heaven would render him beautiful, vi|gorous, and witty. But it &s;oon turned out that all their confidence was ill founded; for the queen's &s;uppo&s;ed pregnancy was only the
<PB N="63" REF="65">
beginning of a drop&s;y, which the di&s;ordered &s;tate of her health had brought upon her.</P>
<P>This opinion of the queen's pregnancy was all along carefully kept up by Philip, as it was an artifice by which he hoped to extend his authority in the kingdom. But he was mi&s;ta|ken: the Engli&s;h parliament, however lax in their principles at that time, harboured a con|tinual jealou&s;y again&s;t him, and pa&s;&s;ed repeat|ed acts, by which they a&s;certained the limits of his power, and confirmed the authority of the queen. Ambition was his only ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and the extreme fondne&s;s of the queen for his per&s;on was rather permitted by him than de&s;ired. He only wanted to make her inclinations &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of his power; but finding her unable to &s;atisfy him in that hope, he no longer treated her with any return of affection, but behaved to her with apparent indifference and neglect. At length, tired with her importunities and jea|lou&s;ies, and finding his authority extremely limited in England, he took hold of the fir&s;t opportunity to leave her, and went over to the emperor his father in Flanders. In the mean time, the queen's pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;ed in proportion to the coolne&s;s with which it was returned. She pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time
<PB N="64" REF="66">
in &s;olitude, where &s;he gave vent to her &s;or|rows, either by tears or by writing fond epi&s;tles to Philip, who, except when he wanted money, &s;eldom returned her any an&s;wer. To &s;upply his demands upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;he took &s;everal very extorting methods by loans, which were forced from &s;everal whom &s;he thought mo&s;t affectionate to her per&s;on, or be&s;t able to &s;pare it. She offered the Engli&s;h merchants at Antwerp fourteen per cent. for a loan of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and yet was mortified by a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>She was more &s;ucce&s;sful in her attempts to engage the Engli&s;h in a war with France, at the in&s;tigation of her hu&s;band, although in the end it turned out to her utter confu&s;ion. A war had ju&s;t been commenced between Spain and that kingdom; and Philip, who took this occa&s;ion to come over to England, declared, that if he were not &s;econded by England at this cri&s;is, he would never &s;ee the country more. This declaration greatly heightened the queen's zeal for promoting his intere&s;ts; and though &s;he was warmly oppo&s;ed in this mea&s;ure by cardinal Pole, and the re&s;t of her council, yet, by threatening to di&s;mi&s;s them all, &s;he at la&s;t &s;ucceeded. War was declared again&s;t France, and preparations were every

where made for attacking that kingdom with vigour.<MILESTONE N="1557" UNIT="A.D."> An army of ten thou&s;and men was rai&s;ed, and &s;upplied by various methods of ex|tortion, and &s;ent over into Flanders.</P>
<P>A battle gained by the Spaniards at St. Quintin &s;eemed to promi&s;e great &s;ucce&s;s to the allied arms; but &s;oon an action, performed by the duke of Gui&s;e in the mid&s;t of winter, turn|ed the &s;cale in favour of France, and affect|ed, if not the intere&s;ts, at lea&s;t the honour of England in the tendere&s;t point. Calais had now for above two hundred years been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h; it had been made the chief market for wool, and other Briti&s;h com|modities; it had been &s;trongly fortified at different times, and was then deemed im|pregnable. But all the fortifications, which were rai&s;ed before gunpowder was found out, were very ill able to re&s;i&s;t the attacks of a re|gular battery from cannon; and they only continued to enjoy an ancient reputation for &s;trength, which they were very ill able to maintain. Coligny, the French general, had remarked to the duke of Gui&s;e, that as the town of Calais was &s;urrounded by mar&s;hes, which during winter were impa&s;&s;able, except over a dyke guarded by two ca&s;tles, St. Aga|tha and Newnam Bridge; the Engli&s;h were,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
of late, accu&s;tomed, to &s;ave expence, to di&s;|mi&s;s a great part of the garri&s;on at the ap|proach of winter, and recall them in &s;pring. The duke of Gui&s;e upon this, made a &s;udden and unexpected march towards Calais, and a&s;&s;aulted the ca&s;tle of St. Agatha with three thou&s;and arquebu&s;iers. The garri&s;on was &s;oon obliged to retreat to their other ca&s;tle of New|nam Bridge, and &s;hortly after compelled to quit that po&s;t, and to take &s;helter in the city. Mean while a &s;mall fleet was &s;ent to block up the entrance of the harbour; and thus Calais was inve&s;ted by land and &s;ea. The governor, lord Wentworth, made a brave defence; but his garri&s;on being very weak, they were unable to re&s;i&s;t an a&s;&s;ault given by the French, who made a lodgement in the ca&s;tle. On the night following, Wentworth attempted to recover this po&s;t; but having lo&s;t two hundred men in the attack, he was obliged to capitulate; &s;o that in le&s;s than eight days, the duke of Gui&s;e recovered a city that had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h &s;ince the time of Edward the third, and which he had &s;pent eleven months in be&s;ieging. This lo&s;s filled the whole kingdom with murmurs, and the queen with de&s;pair; &s;he was heard to &s;ay, that when dead, the name of Calais would be found engraven on her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">The&s;e complicated evils, a murmuring peo|ple, an encrea&s;ing here&s;y, a di&s;dainful hu&s;band, and an un&s;ucce&s;sful war, made dreadful depre|dations on Mary's con&s;titution. She began to appear con&s;umptive, and this rendered her mind &s;till more moro&s;e and bigotted. The people now therefore began to turn their thoughts to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and the prince&s;s Elizabeth came into a greater degree of con|&s;ideration than before. During this whole reign, the nation was in continual apprehen|&s;ions with regard not only to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but the life of this prince&s;s. The violent hatred of the queen broke out upon every occa&s;ion; while Elizabeth, con&s;cious of her danger, pa&s;t her time wholly in reading and &s;tudy, entirely detached from bu&s;ine&s;s. Propo&s;als of marriage had been made to her by the Swedi&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador, in his ma&s;ter's name; but &s;he referred him to the queen, who leaving it to her own choice, &s;he had the magnanimity to re&s;erve her&s;elf for better fortune. Nor was &s;he le&s;s prudent in concealing her &s;entiments of reli|gion, and in eluding all que&s;tions relative to that dangerous &s;ubject. She was obnoxious to Mary for two rea&s;ons; as &s;he was next heir to the throne, it was feared &s;he might a&s;pire to it during her &s;i&s;ter's life-time; but it was
<PB N="68" REF="70">
&s;till more rea&s;onably apprehended that &s;he would, if ever &s;he came to the crown, make an innovation in that religion, which Mary took &s;uch pains to e&s;tabli&s;h. The bi&s;hops, who had &s;hed &s;uch a deluge of blood, fore&s;aw this; and often told Mary that her de&s;troying meaner heretics was of no advantage to the &s;tate, while the body of the tree was &s;uffered to remain. Mary &s;aw and acknowledged the cogency of their arguments, confined her &s;i&s;ter with proper guards, and only waited for &s;ome fre&s;h in&s;urrection, or &s;ome favourable pretext, to de&s;troy her. Her own death prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty.</P>
<P>Mary had been long in a very declining &s;tate of health; and having mi&s;taken her drop|&s;y for a pregnancy, &s;he made u&s;e of an impro|per regimen, which had encrea&s;ed the di&s;or|der. Every reflection now tormented her. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being hated by her &s;ub|jects, the pro&s;pect of Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, whom &s;he hated, and, above all, her anxiety for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, who never intend|ed to return; all the&s;e preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which &s;he died, after a &s;hort and unfortunate reign of five years, four months, and eleven days, in the forty-third year of her age. Cardinal

Pole, who&s;e gentlene&s;s in power we have of|ten had occa&s;ion to mention, &s;urvived her but one day. She was buried in Henry the &s;e|venth's chapel, according to the rites of the church of Rome.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="A.D."> WERE we to adopt the maxim of the catholics them&s;elves, that evil may be done for the production of good, one might &s;ay that the per&s;ecutions in Mary's reign were permitted only to bring the kingdom more generally over to the prote&s;tant religion. No|thing could preach &s;o effectually again&s;t the cruelty and vices of the monks, as the actions
<PB N="71" REF="73">
of the monks them&s;elves. Wherever heretics were to be burnt, the monks were always pre|&s;ent, rejoicing at the flames, in&s;ulting the fal|len, and frequently the fir&s;t to thru&s;t the flam|ing brand again&s;t the faces of the &s;ufferers. The Engli&s;h were effectually converted by &s;uch &s;ights as the&s;e from their ancient &s;uper|&s;titions. To bring the people over to any opinion, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ecute, in&s;tead of attempting to convince. The peo|ple had formerly been compelled to embrace the prote&s;tant religion, and their fears induced them to conform; but now almo&s;t the whole nation were prote&s;tants from inclination.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, could exceed the joy that was diffu&s;ed among the people upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth, who now came to the throne without any oppo&s;ition. She had been at Hatfield, when informed of her &s;i&s;ter's death; and, ha&s;tening up to London, was re|ceived by the multitude with univer&s;al acclama|tions. Elizabeth had her education in that be&s;t &s;chool, the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; and &s;he had made the proper u&s;e of her confinement. Being debarred the enjoyment of plea&s;ures a|broad, &s;he &s;ought for knowledge at home; &s;he cultivated her under&s;tanding, learned the languages and &s;ciences; but of all the arts which &s;he acquired, that of concealing her
<PB N="72" REF="74">
opinions, of checking her inclinations, of di&s;|plea&s;ing none, and of learning to reign, were the mo&s;t beneficial to her.</P>
<P>This virgin monarch, as &s;ome hi&s;torians have called her, upon entering the Tower according to cu&s;tom, could not refrain from remarking on the difference of her pre&s;ent, and her former fortune, when &s;he was &s;ent there as a pri&s;oner, and from whence &s;he had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped. She had al&s;o been &s;carce proclaimed queen, when Philip, who had been married to Mary, but who ever te&s;tified a partiality in favour of Elizabeth, ordered his amba&s;&s;ador in London, the duke of Feria, to make her propo&s;als of marriage from his ma&s;ter. What political motives Elizabeth might have again&s;t this marriage, are not mentioned; but certain it is, that &s;he neither liked the per&s;on, nor the religion of her admirer. She was willing at once to enjoy the plea&s;ures of independence, and the vanity of numerous &s;olicitations. But while the&s;e were her views, &s;he returned him a very obliging, though eva&s;ive an&s;wer; and he &s;till retained &s;uch hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;en|ger to Rome, with orders to &s;olicit the di&s;|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Elizabeth had, from the beginning, re&s;olved upon reforming the church, even while &s;he was
<PB N="73" REF="75">
held in the con&s;traints of a pri&s;on; and now, upon coming to the crown, &s;he immediately &s;et about it. But not to alarm the partizans of the catholic religion all at once, &s;he retain|ed eleven of her &s;i&s;ter's council; and, in or|der to balance their authority, added eight more who were known to be affectionate to the prote&s;tant religion. Her particular advi&s;er, however, was Sir William Cecil, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, a man more earne&s;tly employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s than the &s;peculations of the times; and who&s;e temper it was to wi&s;h for any religion that he thought would contribute to the welfare of the &s;tate. By his advice, therefore, &s;he immediately recalled all exiles, and gave liberty to all pri&s;oners who were con|fined on account of religion. She next pub|li&s;hed a proclamation, by which &s;he forbade all preaching without a &s;pecial licence. She al&s;o &s;u&s;pended the laws &s;o far as to have a great part of the &s;ervice to be read in Engli&s;h,<MILESTONE N="1559" UNIT="A.D."> and forbade the ho&s;t to be any more elevated in her pre&s;ence. A parliament &s;oon after com|pleted what the prerogative had begun; act after act was pa&s;&s;ed in favour of the reforma|tion; and in a &s;ingle &s;e&s;&s;ion the form of reli|gion was e&s;tabli&s;hed as we at pre&s;ent have the happine&s;s to enjoy it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">The oppo&s;ition which was made to the&s;e religious e&s;tabli&s;hments was furious, but feeble. A conference, of nine doctors on each &s;ide, was propo&s;ed and agreed to, in pre&s;ence of the lord keeper Bacon. They were to di&s;pute public|ly upon either &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and it was re&s;olved that the people &s;hould hold to that which came off with the victory. Di&s;putations of this kind never carry conviction to either par|ty; &s;o much is to be &s;aid, and &s;o wide is the field that both &s;ides have to range in, that the &s;trength of both is exhau&s;ted before the en|gagement may be properly &s;aid to begin. The conference therefore came to nothing; the ca|tholics declared that it was not in their power to di&s;pute a &s;econd time upon topics, on which they had gained a former victory; while the prote&s;tants, on the other &s;ide, a&s;cribed their caution to their fears. Of nine thou&s;and four hundred beneficed clergymen, which were the number of tho&s;e in the kingdom, only fourteen bi&s;hops, twelve archdeacons, fifteen heads of colleges, and about eighty of the parochial clergy, cho&s;e to quit their preferments rather than give up their religion. Thus England was &s;een to change its belief in religion four times &s;ince the beginning of the reign of Henry the eighth. <Q REND="inline">"Strange, &s;ays a foreign writer,

<P>Elizabeth was now fixed upon a prote&s;tant throne; and had con&s;equently all the catholic powers of Europe her open or &s;ecret enemies France, Scotland, the pope, and even Spain it&s;elf, began to think of combining again&s;t her. Her &s;ubjects of Ireland were concealed enemies; and the catholic party in England, though profe&s;&s;ing obedience, were yet ready to take the advantage of her &s;lighte&s;t misfortunes. The&s;e were the dangers &s;he had to fear; nor had &s;he formed a &s;ingle alliance to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any foreign friends that &s;he could &s;afely rely on. In this &s;ituation, therefore, &s;he could hope for no other re&s;ource but what pro|ceeded from the affection of her own &s;ubjcts, her own in&s;ight into her affairs, and the wi&s;|dom of her admini&s;tration. From the beginning of her reign, &s;he &s;eemed to aim at two very difficult attainments; to make her&s;elf loved by her &s;ubjects, and feared by her courtiers. She re&s;olved to be frugal of her trea&s;ury; and &s;till more &s;paring in her rewards to favourites.
<PB N="76" REF="78">
This at once kept the people in good humour; and the great too poor to &s;hake off their inde|pendence. She al&s;o &s;hewed, that &s;he knew how to di&s;tribute both rewards and puni&s;hments with impartiality; that &s;he knew when to &s;ooth, and when to upbraid; that &s;he could di&s;&s;em|ble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but pre&s;erve her prerogatives. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;eemed to have &s;tudied the people &s;he was born to govern, and even &s;hewed that &s;he knew when to flatter their foibles to &s;ecure their affections.</P>
<P>Her chief mini&s;ter was Robert Dudley, &s;on to the late duke of Northumberland, whom &s;he &s;eemed to regard from capricious mo|tives, as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither of abilities nor virtue. But to make amends, the two favourites next in power, were Bacon and Ce|cil, men of great capacity and infinite appli|cation: they regulated the finances, and di|rected the political mea&s;ures with foreign courts, that were afterwards followed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of permanent felicity is not to be ex|pected here; and Mary Stuart, commonly called Mary queen of Scots, was the fir&s;t per|&s;on that excited the fears or the re&s;entment of Elizabeth. We have already mentioned, that Henry the &s;eventh married his elde&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="79">
daughter, Margaret, to James, king of Scot|land, who dying, left no i&s;&s;ue that came to ma|turity except Mary, afterwards &s;urnamed Queen of Scots. At a very early age, this prin|ce&s;s being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment of per&s;on and mind, was married to Francis, the dauphin of France, who dying, left her a widow at the age of nineteen. As Elizabeth had been declared illigitimate by Henry the eighth, Francis, in right of his wife, began to a&s;&s;ume the title of king of England; nor did the queen of Scots, his con&s;ort, &s;eem to decline &s;haring in this empty appellation. But though no|thing could have been more unju&s;t than &s;uch a claim, or more unlikely to &s;ucceed, Eliza|beth, knowing that &s;uch preten&s;ions might pro|duce troubles in England, &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to France, complaining of the behaviour of that court in this in&s;tance. Francis, however, was not upon &s;uch good terms with Elizabeth as to forego any claims that would di&s;tre&s;s her; and her amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent home with|out &s;atisfaction. Upon the death of Francis, Mary, the widow, &s;till &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to keep up the title; but finding her&s;elf expo&s;ed to the per&s;ecutions of the dowager queen, who now began to take the lead in France, &s;he determin|ed to return home to Scotland, and demanded
<PB N="78" REF="80">
a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age from Elizabeth through Eng|land. But it was now Elizabeth's turn to re|fu&s;e; and &s;he &s;ent back a very haughty an|&s;wer to Mary's reque&s;t. From hence a deter|mined per&s;onal enmity began to prevail be|tween the&s;e rival queens, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for many years after, until at la&s;t the &s;uperior for|tune of Elizabeth prevailed.</P>
<P>As the tran&s;actions of this unfortunate queen make a di&s;tingui&s;hed part in Elizabeth's hi&s;tory, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give them greater room than I have hitherto given to the occurences of Scotland. The reforma|tion in England having taken place, in Scot|land, al&s;o, that work was begun, but with cir|cum&s;tances of greater animo&s;ity again&s;t their ancient &s;uper&s;titions. The mutual re&s;entment which either party, in that kingdom, bore to each other, knew no bounds; and a civil war was likely to end the di&s;pute. It was in this di|vided &s;tate of the people, that Elizabeth, by giving encouragement to the reformers, gain|ed over their affections from their natural queen, who was a catholic, and who con&s;e|quently favoured tho&s;e of that per&s;ua&s;ion. Thus religion at la&s;t effected a &s;incere friend|&s;hip between the Engli&s;h and Scotch, which neither treaties, nor marriages, nor the vicini|ty
<PB N="79" REF="81">
of &s;ituation, was able to produce. The re|formers, to a man, con&s;idered Elizabeth as their patrone&s;s and defender, and Mary as their per|&s;ecutor and enemy.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ituation of things, that Mary returned from France to reign at home in Scotland, entirely attached to the cu&s;toms and manners of the people &s;he left; and con&s;e|quently very aver&s;e to the gloomy &s;everity which her reformed &s;ubjects affected, and which they fancied made a proper ingredient in reli|gion. A difference in religion between the &s;overeign and the people is ever productive of bad effects; &s;ince it is apt to produce con|tempt on the one &s;ide, and jealou&s;y on the other. Mary could not avoid regarding the four manners of the reformed clergy, who now bore &s;way among the people, without a mix|ture of ridicule and hatred; while they, on the other hand, could not look tamely on the gaie|ties and levities which &s;he introduced among them, without abhorrence and re&s;entment. The jealou&s;y thus excited, began every day to grow &s;tronger; the clergy waited only for &s;ome in|di&s;cretion in the queen to &s;ly out into open op|po&s;ition; and her indi&s;cretion but to &s;oon gave them &s;ufficient opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">After two years had been &s;pent in alter|cation and reproach, between Mary and her &s;ubjects, it was re&s;olved upon at la&s;t by her council, that &s;he &s;hould look out for &s;ome alliance, by which &s;he might be &s;heltered and protected again&s;t the in&s;olence and mi&s;guided zeal of her &s;piritual in&s;tructors.<MILESTONE N="1564" UNIT="A.D."> After &s;ome deliberation, the lord Darnley, &s;on to the earl of Lenox, was the per&s;on in whom their opinions and wi&s;hes centered. He had been born and educated in England, was now in his twentieth year, was cou&s;in-german to the queen; and what perhaps &s;he might admire &s;till more, he was extremely tall. Elizabeth was &s;ecretly no way aver&s;e to this marriage, as it freed her from the dread of a foreign al|liance; but when informed that it was actual|ly concluded and con&s;ummated, &s;he pretended to te&s;tify the utmo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure; &s;he menaced, complained, prote&s;ted; &s;eized all the earl of Lenox's Engli&s;h e&s;tate, and threw the counte&s;s and her &s;econd &s;on into the Tower. This du|plicity of conduct was common enough with Elizabeth; and on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, it &s;erv|ed her as a pretext for refu&s;ing Mary's title to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England, which that prin|ce&s;s had frequently urged, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">But notwith&s;tanding Elizabeth's complaints and re&s;entment, Mary was re&s;olved to indulge her own inclinations, and, &s;truck with the beauty of Darnley's figure, the match was driven forward with all expedition; and &s;ome of the fir&s;t weeks of their connexion &s;eemed to promi&s;e an happy union for the re&s;t of their lives. However, it was not without &s;ome op|po&s;ition from the reformers that this marriage was completed. It was agitated, whether the queen could marry without the con&s;ent of the people? Some lords ro&s;e up in arms to pre|vent it; but being pur&s;ued by a &s;uperior force, they found them&s;elves obliged to abandon their country, and take refuge in England. Thus far all was favourable to Mary; and thus far &s;he kept within the bounds of &s;trict virtue. Her enemies were bani&s;hed, her ri|val over-ruled, and &s;he her&s;elf married to the man &s;he loved.</P>
<P>While Mary had been dazzled by the plea&s;|ing exterior of her new lover, &s;he had entirely forgot to look to the accompli&s;hments of his mind. Darnley was but a weak and ignorant man; violent, yet variable in his enterprizes; in&s;olent, yet credulous, and ea&s;ily governed by flatterers; devoid of all gratitude, becau&s;e he thought no favours equal to his merit; and
<PB N="82" REF="84">
being addicted to low plea&s;ures, he was equally incapable of all true &s;entiments of love and tenderne&s;s. Mary, in the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of her fondne&s;s, had taken a plea&s;ure in exalting him beyond mea&s;ure; but having lei&s;ure afterwards to remark his weakne&s;s and his vices, &s;he be|gan to convert her admiration into di&s;gu&s;t; and Darnly, enraged at her encrea&s;ing cold|ne&s;s, pointed his vengeance again&s;t every per|&s;on he e&s;teemed the cau&s;e of this change in her &s;entiments and behaviour.</P>
<P>There was then in the court one David Rizzio, the &s;on of a mu&s;ician at Turin, him|&s;elf a mu&s;ician, who finding it difficult to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by his art in his own country, had fol|lowed the amba&s;&s;ador from that court into Scotland. As he under&s;tood mu&s;ic to perfec|tion, and &s;ung a good ba&s;s, he was introdu|ced into the queen's concert, who was &s;o taken with him, that &s;he de&s;ired the amba&s;&s;a|dor, upon his departure, to leave Rizzio be|hind. The excellence of his voice &s;oon pro|cured him greater familiarities; and although he was by no means hand&s;ome, but rather ugly, the queen &s;eemed to place peculiar con|fidence in him, and ever kept him next her per&s;on. Her &s;ecretary for French di&s;patches having &s;ome time after fallen under her di&s;|plea&s;ure,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
plea&s;ure, &s;he promoted Rizzio to that office, who, being &s;hrewd, &s;en&s;ible, and a&s;piring be|yond his rank, &s;oon after began to enter|tain hopes of being promoted to the im|portant office of chancellor of the kingdom. He was con&s;ulted on all occa&s;ions; no favours could be obtained but by his interce&s;&s;ion, and all &s;uitors were fir&s;t obliged to gain Rizzio to their intere&s;ts, by pre&s;ents, or by flattery. It was ea&s;y to prevail upon a man of Darn|ley's jealous uxorious temper, that Rizzio was the per&s;on who had e&s;tranged the queen's af|fections from him; and a &s;urmi&s;e once con|ceived became to him a certainty. He &s;oon therefore con&s;ulted with &s;ome lords of his party, &s;tung as he was with envy, rage, and re&s;entment; and they not only fanned the con|flagration in his mind, but offered their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to di&s;patch Rizzio. George Douglas, natural brother to the counte&s;s of Lenox, the lords Ruthven and Lind&s;ey, &s;ettled the cir|cum&s;tances of this poor creature's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination among them; and determined that, as a pu|ni&s;hment for the queen's indi&s;cretions, the mur|der &s;hould be committed in her pre&s;ence. Mary was at this time in the &s;ixth month of her pregnancy, and was then &s;upping in pri|vate, at table with the counte&s;s of Argyle,
<PB N="84" REF="86">
her natural &s;i&s;ter, &s;ome other &s;ervants, and her favourite Rizzio. Lord Darnly led the way into the apartment by a private &s;tair-ca&s;e, and &s;tood for &s;ome time leaning at the back of Mary's chair. His fierce looks and unexpect|ed intru&s;ion greatly alarmed the queen, who, neverthele&s;s, kept &s;ilence, not daring to call out. A little after lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and the other con&s;pirators, ru&s;hed in, all armed, and &s;hewing in their looks the brutality of their intentions. The queen could no longer re&s;train her terrors, but demanded the rea&s;on of this bold intru&s;ion. Ruthven made her no an&s;wer; but ordered Rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy. Riz|zio now &s;aw that he was the object of their vengeance; and trembling with apprehen&s;ion took hold of the queen's robes to put him&s;elf under her protection, who, on her part, &s;trove to interpo&s;e between the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and him. Douglas, in the mean time, had reached the unfortunate Rizzio; and &s;natching a dagger from the king's &s;ide, while the queen filled the room with her cries, plunged it in her pre|&s;ence into Rizzio's bo&s;om, who, &s;creaming with fear and agony, was torn from Mary by the other con&s;pirators, and dragged into the anti-chamber, where he was di&s;patched with
<PB N="85" REF="87">
fifty-&s;ix wounds. The unhappy prince&s;s con|tinued her lamentations; but being informed of his fate, at once dried her tears, and &s;aid &s;he would weep no more, for &s;he would now think of revenge. The in&s;ult indeed upon her per&s;on and honour, and the danger to which her life was expo&s;ed on account of her pregnancy, were injuries &s;o atrocious and &s;o complicated, that they &s;carce left room for pardon.</P>
<P>This act of violence was only to be puni&s;h|ed by temporizing; &s;he pretended to forgive &s;o great a crime; and exerted the force of her natural allurements &s;o powerfully, that her hu&s;band &s;ubmitted implicitly to her will. He &s;oon gave up his accomplices to her re&s;ent|ment, and retired with her to Dunbar, while &s;he, having collected an army, which the con|&s;pirators had no power to re&s;i&s;t, advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them to fly into Eng|land, where they lived in great poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. They made application, however, to the earl of Bothwell, a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, de&s;irous to &s;treng|then his party by the acce&s;&s;ion of their inter|e&s;t, was able to pacify her re&s;entment, and he &s;oon after procured them liberty to return home.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">The vengeance of the queen was implacable to her hu&s;band alone; his per&s;on was before di&s;agreeable to her; and having per&s;uaded him to give up his accomplices, &s;he treated him with merited di&s;dain and indignation. But it were well for her character and happine&s;s had &s;he re&s;ted only in de&s;pi&s;ing; &s;he &s;ecretly re&s;olved on a &s;everer revenge. The earl Both|wel, who was now become her favourite, was of a con&s;iderable family in Scotland; and though not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any talents, civil or military, yet he made &s;ome noi&s;e in the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the &s;tate, and was an oppo&s;er of the reformation. He was a man of profligate manners, had involved his fortune in great debts, and had reduced him&s;elf to beggary by his profu&s;ion. This nobleman, notwith&s;tanding, had ingratiated him&s;elf &s;o far with the queen, that all her mea&s;ures were entirely directed by his advice and authority. Reports were even &s;pread of more particular intimacies; and the&s;e gave &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s to Darnley, that he left the court, and retired to Gla&s;gow, to be no longer a &s;pectator of her exce&s;&s;es. But this was not what the queen aimed at; &s;he was determined upon more ample puni&s;hment. Shortly after, all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to her character, or repo&s;e to their country, were ex|tremely
<PB N="87" REF="89">
plea&s;ed, and &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, to hear that her tenderne&s;s for her hu&s;band was revived; and that &s;he had taken a journey to vi&s;it him, during his &s;ickne&s;s there. Darnley was &s;o far allured by her behaviour on this oc|ca&s;ion, that he re&s;olved to part with her no more; he put him&s;elf under her protection, and &s;oon after attended her to Edinburgh, which it was thought would be a place more favourable to his declining health. She lived in the palace of Holyroood-hou&s;e; but as the &s;ituation of that place was low, and the con|cour&s;e of per&s;ons about the court nece&s;&s;arily attended with noi&s;e, which might di&s;turb him in his pre&s;ent infirm &s;tate, &s;he fitted up an a|partment for him in a &s;olitary hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, called the Kirk of Field. Mary there gave him marks of kindne&s;s and attachment; &s;he conver&s;ed cordially with him, and &s;he lay &s;ome nights in a room under him. It was on the ninth of February that &s;he told him &s;he would pa&s;s that night in the palace, becau&s;e the marriage of one of her &s;ervants was to be there celebrated in her pre&s;ence. But dread|ful con&s;equences en&s;ued. About two o'clock in the morning the whole city was much alarmed at hearing a great noi&s;e; the hou&s;e in which Darnley lay was blown up with gun|powder.
<PB N="88" REF="90">
His dead body was found at &s;ome di&s;tance in a neighbouring field, but without any marks of violence or contu&s;ion. No doubt could be entertained but that Darnley was murdered; and the general &s;u&s;picion fell upon Bothwell as the perpetrator.</P>
<P>All orders of the &s;tate, and the whole body of the people, began to demand ju&s;tice on the &s;uppo&s;ed murderer; the queen her&s;elf was not entirely exempt from the general &s;u&s;picion; and papers were privately &s;tuck up every where, ac|cu&s;ing her of being an accomplice. Mary, more &s;olicitous to puni&s;h others than defend her|&s;elf, offered rewards for the di&s;covery of tho&s;e who had &s;pread &s;uch reports; but no rewards were offered for the di&s;covery of the murderers. One indi&s;cretion led on to another; Bothwell, though accu&s;ed of being &s;tained with her hu&s;|band's blood, though univer&s;ally odious to the people, had the confidence, while Mary was on her way to Stirling, on a vi&s;it to her &s;on, to &s;eize her at the head of a body of eight hundred hor&s;e, and to carry her to Dunbar, where he forced her to yield to his purpo&s;es. It was then thought by the people that the mea|&s;ure of his crimes was complete; and that he who was &s;uppo&s;ed to kill the queen's hu&s;band, and to have offered violence to her per&s;on,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
could expect no mercy; but they were a&s;to|ni&s;hed upon finding, in&s;tead of di&s;grace, that Bothwell was taken into more than former fa|vour; and, to crown all, that he was married to the queen, having divorced his own wife to procure this union.</P>
<P>This was a fatal alliance to Mary; and the people were now wound up by the complica|tion of her guilt, to pay very little deference to her authority. The prote&s;tant teachers, who had great power, had long borne great animo&s;ity towards her; the opinion of her guilt was by that means more widely diffu&s;ed, and made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion. The princi|pal nobility met at Stirling; and an a&s;&s;ociation was &s;oon formed for protecting the young prince, and puni&s;hing the king's murderers. Lord Hume was the fir&s;t in arms; and lead|ing a body of eight hundred hor&s;e, &s;uddenly environed the queen and Bothwell, in the ca&s;|tle of Borthwick. They found means, how|ever, to make their e&s;cape; and Bothwell, at the head of a few forces, meeting the a&s;&s;ocia|tors within about &s;ix miles of Edinburgh, was obliged to capitulate, while Mary was con|ducted by the prevailing party into Edin|burgh, amid&s;t the in&s;ults and reproaches of the populace. From thence &s;he was &s;ent a
<PB N="90" REF="92">
pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin, &s;ituated in a lake of that name, where &s;he &s;uffered all the &s;everities of an unkind keeper, and an up|braiding con&s;cience, with a feeling heart. Both|well, however, was more fortunate; he fled during the conference, unattended to Dunbar, where fitting out a few &s;mall &s;hips, he &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted among the Orkneys for &s;ome time by piracy. Being pur&s;ued thither, and his do|me&s;tics taken, who made a full di&s;covery of his crimes, he e&s;caped him&s;elf in an open boat to Denmark, where he was thrown into pri&s;on, lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and died mi&s;erably about ten years afterwards.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, Mary was not entirely without protection and friends. Queen Eli|zabeth, who now &s;aw her rival entirely hum|bled, began to relent; &s;he was &s;een to reflect on the precarious &s;tate of royal grandeur, and the danger of encouraging rebellious &s;ubjects; &s;he, therefore, &s;ent Sir Nicholas Throgmorton as her amba&s;&s;ador to Scotland, to interpo&s;e in her behalf; but the a&s;&s;ociated lords thought proper to deny him, after &s;everal affected de|lays, all acce&s;s to Mary's per&s;on. However, though he could not confer with her, he pro|cured her the be&s;t terms with the rebellious lords that he could, which was, that &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="91" REF="93">
re&s;ign the crown in favour of her &s;on, who was as yet a minor; that &s;he &s;hould appoint the earl of Murray, who had from the begin|ing te&s;tified an hatred to lord Darnly, as re|gent of the kingdom; and as he was then in France, that &s;he &s;hould appoint a council till his arrival. Mary could not think of re&s;ign|ing all power without a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears; but at la&s;t &s;igned what was brought to her, even without in&s;pection. In con&s;equence of this forced re&s;ignation, the young prince was proclaimed king, under the title of James the &s;ixth. The queen had now no hopes but from the kindne&s;s of the earl of Murray; but even here &s;he was di&s;appointed; the earl, upon his return, in&s;tead of comforting her, as &s;he expected, loaded her with reproaches, which reduced her almo&s;t to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The calamities of the great, even though ju&s;tly de&s;erved, &s;eldom fail of creating pity, and procuring friends. Mary, by her charms and promi&s;es, had engaged a young gentle|man, who&s;e name was George Douglas, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in e&s;caping from the place where &s;he was confined: and this he effected, by convey|ing her in di&s;gui&s;e in a &s;mall boat, rowed by him&s;elf, a-&s;hore. It was now that the news of her enlargement being &s;pread abroad, all
<PB N="92" REF="94">
the loyalty of the people &s;eemed to revive once more. As Bothwell was no longer a&s;&s;ociated in her cau&s;e, many of the nobility, who expect|ed to &s;ucceed him in favour, &s;igned a bond of a&s;&s;ociation for her defence; and in a few days &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf at the head of &s;ix thou|&s;and men.</P>
<P>The earl of Murray, who had been declared regent, was not &s;low in a&s;&s;embling his forces; and although his army was inferior to that of the queen of Scots, he boldly took the field again&s;t her. A battle was fought at Lang&s;ide, near Gla&s;gow, which was entirely deci&s;ive in his favour; and he &s;eemed to merit victory by his clemency after the action. Mary, now totally ruined, fled &s;outhwards from the field of battle with great precipitation; <MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="A.D."> and came with a few attendants to the borders of Eng|land, where &s;he hoped for protection from Elizabeth, who had upon &s;ome recent occa|&s;ions declared in her favour.</P>
<P>With the&s;e hopes &s;he embarked on board a fi&s;hing boat in Galloway, and landed the &s;ame day at Wirkington in Cumberland, a|bout thirty miles di&s;tant from Carli&s;le, whence &s;he immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to London, craving protection, and de&s;iring liber|ty to vi&s;it the queen. Elizabeth being inform|ed
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of her misfortunes and retreat, deliberat|ed for &s;ome time upon the proper methods of proceeding, and re&s;olved at la&s;t to act in a friendly, yet cautious manner. She immedi|ately &s;ent orders to lady Scrope, &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Norfolk, a lady who lived in that neighbourhood, to attend on the queen of Scots; and &s;oon after di&s;patched lord Scrope him&s;elf, and &s;ir Francis Knolles, to pay her all po&s;&s;i|ble re&s;pect. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e marks of di&s;tinction, the queen refu&s;ed to admit Mary into her pre&s;ence, untill &s;he had cleared her character from the many foul a&s;per&s;ions that it was &s;tained with. It might, perhaps, have been Elizabeth's duty to protect, and not to examine, her royal fugitive. However, &s;he acted entirely under the direction of her coun|cil, who ob&s;erved, that if the crimes of the Scot|ti&s;h prince&s;s were really &s;o great as they were re|pre&s;ented, the treating her with friend&s;hip would but give them a &s;anction; if &s;he was found guiltle&s;s upon trial, every enterpize, which friend&s;hip &s;hould in&s;pire in her defence, would be con&s;idered as laudable and glorious.</P>
<P>Mary was now, though reluctantly, obliged to admit her ancient rival as an umpire in her cau&s;e; and the accu&s;ation was readily under|taken by Murray the regent, who expected
<PB N="94" REF="96">
to remove &s;o powerful an a&s;&s;i&s;tant as Eliza|beth, by the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of Mary's offences. This extraordinary conference, which delibe|rated on the conduct of a foreign queen, was managed at York; three commi&s;&s;ioners being appointed by Elizabeth, nine by the queen of Scots, and five by the regent, in which he him&s;elf was included. The&s;e conferences were carried on for &s;ome time at the place fir&s;t ap|pointed; but after a while, Elizabeth, either unwilling to decide, as &s;he would thus give up the power &s;he was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, or perhaps de&s;irous of throwing all light po&s;&s;ible upon Mary's conduct, ordered the commi&s;&s;i|oners to continue their conferences at Hamp|ton-court, where they were &s;pun out by affect|ed delays. Whatever might have been the cau&s;e of protracting this conference in the beginning is not known; but many of the proofs of Mary's guilt, which were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed at York, made their appearance before the board at Hampton. Among other proofs, were many letters and &s;onnets written in Mary's own hand to Bothwell, in which &s;he di&s;covers her knowledge of Darnley's intended murder, and her contrivance to marry Both|well, by pretending a forced compliance. The&s;e papers, it mu&s;t be owned, are not free

them&s;elves from &s;u&s;picion of being a forgery; yet the rea&s;ons for their authenticity &s;eem to prevail. However this be, the proofs of Mary's guilt appearing &s;tronger, it was thought proper to engage her advocates to give an&s;wers to them; but they, contrary to expectation, refu&s;ed, alledging, that as Mary was a &s;ove|reign prince&s;s, &s;he could not be &s;ubject to any tribunal, not con&s;idering that the aim of this conference was not puni&s;hment, but reconcilia|tion; that it was not to try Mary, in order to inflict penalties, but to know whether &s;he was wor|thy of Elizabeth's friend&s;hip and protection. In&s;tead of attempting to ju&s;tify her conduct, the queen of Scots laboured nothing &s;o much as to obtain an interview with Elizabeth; con&s;cious that her in&s;inuations, arts, and ad|dre&s;s, of all which &s;he was a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s, would be &s;ufficient to per&s;uade her royal &s;i&s;ter, and &s;tand in place of innocence. But as &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in a re&s;olution to make no de|fence, this demand was finally refu&s;ed her.</P>
<P>She &s;till, however, per&s;i&s;ted in demanding Elizabeth's protection; &s;he de&s;ired that either &s;he &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in her endeavours to re|cover her authority, or that liberty &s;hould be given her for retiring into France, there to make trial of the friend&s;hip of other princes.
<PB N="96" REF="98">
But Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible of the danger which attended either of the&s;e propo&s;als, was &s;ecretly re&s;olved to detain her &s;till in captivity, and &s;he was accordingly &s;ent to Tuthury ca&s;tle, in the county of Stafford, where &s;he was put un|der the cu&s;tody of the earl of Shrew&s;bury; there &s;he gave her royal pri&s;oner hopes of one day coming into favour, and that unle&s;s her own ob&s;tinacy prevented, an accommodation might at la&s;t take place.</P>
<P>But this unhappy woman was fated to no|thing but misfortunes; and tho&s;e hopes of ac|commodation which &s;he had been given to ex|pect, were &s;till put off by &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter accident. The factions of her own &s;ubjects in Scotland tended not a little to alarm the jealou&s;y of Elizabeth, and encrea&s;e the rigours of Mary's confinement. The regent of Scotland, who had been long her inveterate enemy, happen|ing to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, in revenge of a private in|jury, by a gentleman of the name of Hamilton, upon his death the kingdom relap&s;ed into its former anarchy. Mary's party once more a&s;|&s;embled them&s;elves together, and became ma&s;|ters of Edinburgh. They even ventured to|wards the borders of England, where they committed &s;ome di&s;orders, which called upon the vigilance of Elizabeth to &s;uppre&s;s. She

quickly &s;ent an army commanded by the earl of Suffex, who entering Scotland, principally cha&s;ti&s;ed all the partizans of the captive queen, under a pretence that they had offended his mi&s;tre&s;s by harbouring Engli&s;h rebels.</P>
<P>But the de&s;igns and arts of Elizabeth did not re&s;t here; while &s;he kept up the mo&s;t friendly corre&s;pendence with Mary, and the mo&s;t warm prote&s;tations of &s;incerity pa&s;&s;ed between them, &s;he was far from either a&s;&s;i&s;ting her cau&s;e, or yet from rendering it de&s;perate. It was her intere&s;t to keep the factions in Scot|land &s;till alive, to weaken the power of that re&s;tle&s;s and trouble&s;ome nation; for this pur|po&s;e &s;he weakened the party of the queen, that had now promi&s;ed to prevail, by tedious negociations; and in the mean time procur|ed the earl of Lenox to be appointed regent, in the room of Murray who was flain.</P>
<P>This attempt, which promi&s;ed to be favour|able to Mary, proved thus un&s;ucce&s;sful, as well as another, which was concerted near the place of her captivity. The duke of Norfolk was the only peer who enjoyed that highe&s;t title of nobility in England; and the qualities of his mind corre&s;ponded to his high &s;tation. Beneficent, affable, and generous,<MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="A.D."> he had ac|quired the affections of the people; and yet
<PB N="98" REF="100">
from his moderation, he had never alarmed the jealou&s;y of the &s;overeign. He was at this time a widower, and being of a &s;uitable age to e&s;pou&s;e the queen of Scots, her own at|tractions, as well as his intere&s;ts, made him de&s;irous of the match. But the obtaining Eli|zabeth's con&s;ent, previous to their nuptials, was con&s;idered as a circum&s;tance e&s;&s;ential to his aims. But while this nobleman made al|mo&s;t all the nobility of England confidants to his pa&s;&s;ion, he never had the prudence, or the courage, to open his full intentions to the queen her&s;elf. On the contrary, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;urmi&s;es that were currently reported, he &s;poke contemptuou&s;ly of Mary to Elizabeth; affirmed that his e&s;tates in England were of more value than the revenue of the whole kingdom; and declared, that when he amu&s;ed him&s;elf in his own tennis-court at Norwich, he was a more magnificent prince than a Scotti&s;h king. This duplicity only &s;erved to enflame the queen's &s;u&s;picions the more; and finding that &s;he gave his profe&s;&s;ions no great degree of credit, he retired from the court in di&s;gu&s;t. Repenting, however, &s;oon after of this mea|&s;ure, he was re&s;olved to return, with a view of regaining the queen's good graces; but on the way, he was &s;topt by a me&s;&s;enger from the
<PB N="99" REF="101">
queen, and &s;oon commited to the Tower under the cu&s;tody of Sir Henry Nevil.</P>
<P>But the duke of Norfolk was too much beloved by his partizans in the North, to be confined without an effort made for his relea&s;e. The earls of We&s;tmorland and Northumber|land had prepared mea&s;ures for a rebellion; had communicated their de&s;ign to Mary and her mini&s;ters; had entered into a corre&s;pon|dence with the duke of Alva, governor of the Low Countries, and had obtained his promi&s;e of men and ammunition. But the vigilance of Elizabeth's mini&s;ters was not to be eluded; or|ders were immediately &s;ent for their appear|ance at court, and now the in&s;urgent lords per|ceiving their &s;chemes di&s;covered, were obliged to begin their revolt before matters were en|tirely prepared for its opening. They accord|ingly publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which they al|ledged, that no injury was intended again&s;t the queen, to whom they vowed un&s;haken al|legiance; but that their &s;ole aim was to re-e&s;|tabli&s;h the religion of their ance&s;tors, to remove all evil coun&s;ellors from about the queen's per&s;on; and to re&s;tore the duke of Norfolk to his liberty and the queen's favour. Their num|ber amounted to four thou&s;and foot, and &s;ix|teen hundred, hor&s;e; and they expected to be
<PB N="100" REF="102">
joined by all the catholics in England. But they &s;oon found them&s;elves mi&s;erably unde|ceived; the queen's conduct had acquired the general good will of the people, and &s;he now perceived that her &s;ure&s;t &s;upport was the ju&s;|tice of her actions. The duke of Norfolk him&s;elf, for who&s;e &s;ake they had revolted, u&s;ed every method that his circum&s;tances would permit, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport the queen; the in|&s;urgents were obliged to retire before her forces to Hexham; and hearing that reinforcements were upon their march to join the royal army, they found no other expedient but to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves without a blow. Northumberland fled into Scotland, and was confined by the re|gent to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin; We&s;tmorland, after attempting to excite the Scotch to revolt, was obliged to e&s;cape into Flanders, where he found protection. This rebellion was follow|ed by another, led on by lord Dacres, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s. Some &s;everities were u&s;ed again&s;t the&s;e revolters, and it is &s;aid, that no le&s;s than eight &s;uffered by the hands of the executioner on this occa&s;ion. The queen was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the duke of Norfolk's be|haviour,<MILESTONE N="1569" UNIT="A.D."> that &s;he now relea&s;ed him from the Tower; allowed him to return home, only exacting a promi&s;e from him, not to proceed
<PB N="101" REF="103">
any farther in his preten&s;ions to the queen of Scots.</P>
<P>But the queen's confidence was fatal to this brave, but unde&s;igning nobleman. He had not been relea&s;ed above a year, when new pro|jects were &s;et on foot by the enemies of the queen and the reformed religion, &s;ecretly fo|mented by Rodolphi, an in&s;trument of the court of Rome, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, Mary's mini&s;ter in England. It was concerted by them, that Norfolk &s;hould renew his de&s;igns upon Mary, to which it is probable he was prompt|ed by pa&s;&s;ion; and this nobleman entering into their &s;chemes, he from being at fir&s;t only ambitious, now became criminal. It was mu|tually agreed, therefore, that the duke &s;hould enter into all Mary's intere&s;ts; while on the other hand, the duke of Alva promi&s;ed to tran&s;port a body of &s;ix thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e, to join Norfolk as &s;oon as he &s;hould be ready to begin. This &s;cheme was &s;o &s;ecretly laid, that it had hitherto entirely e&s;caped the vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of &s;ecretary Cecil, who now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was found out merely by accident; for the duke having &s;ent a &s;um of money to lord Herreis, one of Mary's partizans in Scot|land, omitted tru&s;ting the &s;ervant with the con|tents
<PB N="102" REF="104">
of his me&s;&s;age; and he finding, by the weight of the bag, that it contained a larger &s;um than the duke mentioned to him, began to mi&s;tru&s;t &s;ome plot, and brought the money, with the duke's letter, to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. It was by the artifices of that great &s;tate&s;man, that the duke's &s;ervants were brought to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of their ma&s;ter's guilt; and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s &s;oon after, finding the whole di&s;covered, did not &s;cruple to confirm their te&s;timony. The duke was in&s;tantly committed to the Tower, and ordered to prepare for his trial. A jury of twenty-five peers unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon him; and the queen, four months after, reluctantly &s;igned the warrant for his execution. He died with great calm|ne&s;s and con&s;tancy; and though he cleared him&s;elf of any di&s;loyal intentions again&s;t the queen's authority, he acknowledged the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence by which he &s;uffered. A few months after, the duke of Northumberland be|ing delivered up by the regent, underwent a &s;imilar trial, and was brought to the &s;caffold for his rebellion. All the&s;e ineffectual &s;truggles in favour of the unfortunate queen of Scots, &s;eemed only to rivet the chains of her con|finement; and &s;he now found relief only in the re&s;ources of her own mind, which di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="103" REF="105">
had contributed to &s;often, refine, and improve. From henceforth &s;he continued for &s;everal years a precarious dependent on Elizabeth's &s;u&s;picions; and only waited for &s;ome new ef|fort of her adherents to receive that fate, which political, and not merciful motives &s;eemed to prolong.</P>

<P>HAVING thus far attended the queen of Scotland, who&s;e conduct and misfortunes make &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in this reign, we now return to &s;ome tran&s;actions, prior in point of time, but of le&s;s con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this reign, the Hugo|nots, or reformed party in France, were oblig|ed
<PB N="105" REF="107">
to call in the protection of the Engli&s;h; <MILESTONE N="1562" UNIT="A.D."> and in order to &s;ecure their confidence, as they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t part of Normandy, they offered to put Havre into the queen's hands, a proffer which &s;he immediately ac|cepted. She wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that as that port commanded the mouth of the river Seine, it was of much more importance than Calais; and &s;he could thus have the French &s;till in her power. Accordingly three thou&s;and Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Edward Poinings, but the latter place was found &s;o little capable of being defended, that it was immediately aban|doned. But Havre it&s;elf was obliged to capi|tulate &s;hortly after. Although the garri&s;on was reinforced, and was found to amount to &s;ix thou&s;and men; and every means was em|ployed for putting the town in a po&s;ture of defence again&s;t the French army that was pre|paring to be&s;iege it, yet it felt a &s;everer ene|my within its walls; for the plague had got into the town, and committed &s;uch havock among the &s;oldiers, that an hundred were com|monly &s;een to die of it in one day. The gar|ri&s;on, being thus di&s;pirited and dimini&s;hed to fifteen hundred men, finding the French army indefatigable in their approaches, were obliged
<PB N="106" REF="108">
to capitulate; and thus the Engli&s;h lo&s;t all hopes of ever making another e&s;tabli&s;hment in the kingdom of France. This misfortune was productive of one &s;till more dreadful to the nation, for the Engli&s;h army carried back the plague with them to London, which made &s;uch ravages, that twenty thou&s;and per&s;ons died there in one year.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1563" UNIT="A.D."> This, if we except the troubles rai&s;ed upon the account of Mary, &s;eems to have been the only di&s;a&s;ter that, for above thirteen years, any way contributed to di&s;turb the peace of this reign. Elizabeth, ever vigilant, active, and re|&s;olute, attended to the &s;lighte&s;t alarms, and re|pre&s;&s;ed them before they were capable of pro|ducing their effect. Her frugality kept her independent, and her di&s;&s;imulation (for &s;he could di&s;&s;emble) made her beloved. The opinion of the royal prerogative was &s;uch, that her commands were obeyed as &s;tatutes; and &s;he took care that her parliaments &s;hould ne|ver venture to circum&s;cribe her power. In her &s;chemes of government &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lord Burleigh, and Sir Anthony Bacon, two of the mo&s;t able mini&s;ters that ever directed the affairs of England; but while &s;he com|mitted, to them all the drudgery of duty, her favourite Robert Dudley, earl of Leice&s;ter, en|gro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="107" REF="109">
all her favour, and &s;ecured all the ave|nues to preferment. All reque&s;ts were made through him; and nothing given away with|out his con&s;ent and approbation. His merits, however, were by no means adequate to his &s;ucce&s;&s;es; he was weak, vain, and boa&s;tful; but the&s;e qualities did no injury to the &s;tate, as his two co-adjutors were willing, while he maintained all the &s;plendour of office, to &s;e|cure to them&s;elves the more &s;olid emolu|ments.</P>
<P>During this peaceable and uniform govern|ment, England furni&s;hes but few materials for hi&s;tory. While France was torn with inter|nal convul&s;ions; while above ten thou&s;and of the Hugonots were ma&s;&s;acred in one night, in cool blood, on the fea&s;t of St. Bartholomew, at Paris; while the inhabitants of the Low Countries had &s;haken off the Spani&s;h yoke, and were bravely vindicating their rights and their religion; while all the re&s;t of Europe was teeming with plots, &s;editions, and cruel|ty; the Engli&s;h, under their wi&s;e queen, were enjoying all the benefits of peace, extending commerce, improving manufactures; and &s;et|ing an example of arts and learning to all the re&s;t of the world. Except the &s;mall part, therefore, which Elizabeth took in foreign
<PB N="108" REF="110">
tran&s;actions, there &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed any occurence which requires a particular detail.</P>
<P>There had for &s;ome time ari&s;en di&s;gu&s;ts between the court of England and that of Spain. Elizabeth's having rejected the &s;uit of Philip, might probably have given ri&s;e to the&s;e di&s;tru&s;ts; and after that, Mary's claim|ing the protection of that monarch, tended &s;till more to widen the breach. This began, as u&s;ual on each &s;ide, with petty ho&s;tilities; the Spaniards, on their part, had &s;ent into Ireland a body of &s;even hundred of their nation, and Italians, who built a fort there; but were &s;oon after cut off to a man, by the duke of Or|mond. On the other hand the Engli&s;h, under the conduct of Sir Francis Drake, a&s;&s;aulted the Spaniards in the place where they deemed them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;ecure, in the New World. This was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman that &s;ailed round the globe; and the queen was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his valour and &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;he accepted a banquet from him at Deptford, on board the &s;hip which had atchieved &s;o memorable a voyage.</P>
<P>In this manner, while ho&s;tilities were daily multiplying between Spain and England; and while the power of Spain, as well as the mo|narch's inclinations, were very formidable to
<PB N="109" REF="111">
the queen, &s;he began to look out for an al|liance that might &s;upport her again&s;t &s;uch a dangerous adver&s;ary. The duke of Anjou had long made preten&s;ions to Elizabeth; and though &s;he was near twenty-five years older than he, he took the re&s;olution to prefer his &s;uit in per&s;on, and paid her a vi&s;it in &s;ecret at Greenwich. It appears, that though his figure was not advantageous, his addre&s;s was plea&s;|ing. The queen ordered her mini&s;ters to fix the terms of the contract; a day was appointed for the &s;olemnization of their nuptials, and every thing &s;eemed to &s;peak an approaching union. But Elizabeth could not be induced, as that event appeared to approach, to change her condition; &s;he appeared doubtful, irre&s;o|lute, and melancholy; &s;he was ob&s;erved to pa&s;s &s;everal nights without any &s;leep, till at la&s;t her &s;ettled habits of prudence prevailed over her ambition, and the duke of Anjou was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The queen thus depriving her&s;elf of a fo|reign ally, looked for approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from her own &s;ubjects at home. Yet even here &s;he was not without numberle&s;s enemies, who either hated her for religion, or envied her for &s;ucce&s;s. There were &s;eve|ral con&s;piracies formed again&s;t her life, many
<PB N="110" REF="112">
of which were imputed to the intrigues of the queen of Scots, at lea&s;t it is certain that her name was u&s;ed in all. Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, brother to him beheaded &s;ome years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, &s;on to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, fell under &s;u&s;picion; and the latter was, by order of council, confined to his own hou&s;e. Francis Throgmorton, a private gen|tleman, was committed to cu&s;tody, on ac|count of a letter which he had written to the queen of Scots; and &s;hortly after confe&s;&s;ing his guilt, he was condemned and executed. Soon after William Parry, a catholic gentle|man, who had on a former occa&s;ion received the queen's pardon, was found engaged in a de&s;perate con&s;piracy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his &s;overeign and benefactor. He had con&s;ulted upon the ju&s;tice and expediency of this vile mea&s;ure both with the pope's nuncio and legate, who exhorted him to per&s;evere in his re&s;olution, and extremely applauded his de&s;ign. He, therefore, a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with one Nevil, who entered zealou&s;ly into the de&s;ign; and it was determined to &s;hoot the queen, while &s;he was taking the air on hor&s;eback. But while they were watching an opportunity for the execution of their purpo&s;e, the earl of We&s;t|moreland
<PB N="111" REF="113">
happened to die in exile; and as Nevil was next heir to the family, he began to entertain hopes, that by doing &s;ome accept|able &s;ervice to the queen, he might recover the e&s;tate and honours which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the la&s;t earl. He betrayed the whole con&s;piracy to the mini&s;ters; and Parry being thrown into pri&s;on confe&s;&s;ed the guilt both to them, and to the jury who tried him. He was &s;hortly after condemned and executed.</P>
<P>The&s;e attempts, which were entirely &s;et on foot by the catholic party, &s;erved to encrea&s;e the &s;everity of the laws again&s;t them. Popi&s;h prie&s;ts were bani&s;hed the kingdom; tho&s;e who harboured or relieved them were declared guilty of felony; and many were executed in con&s;equence of this &s;evere edict. Nor was the queen of Scots her&s;elf without &s;ome &s;hare of the puni&s;hment. She was removed from un|der the care of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had always been indulgent to his pri&s;oner, par|ticularly with regard to air and exerci&s;e; and &s;he was committed to the cu&s;tody of Sir Amias Paulett, and Sir Drue Drury, men of honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and at|tention.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">The&s;e con&s;piracies &s;erved to prepare the way for Mary's ruin, who&s;e greate&s;t misfortunes proceeded rather from the violence of her friends, than the malignity of her enemies. Elizabeth's mini&s;ters had long been wait|ing for &s;ome &s;ignal in&s;tance of the captive queen's enmity, which they could ea&s;ily convert into trea&s;on; and this was not long wanting.<MILESTONE N="1586" UNIT="A.D."> About this time one John Ballard, a popi&s;h prie&s;t, who had been bred in the Engli&s;h &s;eminary at Rheims, re&s;olved to com|pa&s;s the death of a queen, whom he con&s;ider|ed as the enemy of his religion; and with that gloomy re&s;olution came over into England in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;oldier, with the a&s;&s;umed name of captain Forte&s;cue. He bent his endea|vours to bring about at once the project of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, an in&s;urrection, and an inva&s;ion. The fir&s;t per&s;on he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to was Anthony Babington, of Dethick, in the county of Derby, a young gentleman of good family, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very plentiful fortune. This per&s;on had been long remarkable for his zeal in the catholic cau&s;e, and in particular for his attachment to the captive queen. He there|fore came readily into the plot, and procured the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other a&s;&s;ociates in this dangerous undertaking. Barn|well,
<PB N="113" REF="115">
a gentleman of a noble family in Ire|land, Charnock, a gentleman of Lanca&s;hire, Abington, who&s;e father had been cofferer to the hou&s;ehold, and chief of all John Savage, a man of de&s;perate fortunes, who had &s;erved in the Low Countries, and came into England under a vow to de&s;troy the queen. He indeed did not &s;eem to de&s;ire any a&s;&s;ociate in the bold enterprize, and refu&s;ed for &s;ome time to per|mit any to &s;hare with him in what he e&s;teemed his greate&s;t glory. He challenged the whole to him&s;elf; and it was with &s;ome difficulty that he was induced to depart from his prepo&s;terous ambition. The next &s;tep was to apprize Mary of the con&s;piracy formed in her favour; and this they effected by conveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that &s;upplied the fa|mily with ale, through a chink, in the wall of her apartment. In the&s;e, Babington informed her of a de&s;ign laid for a foreign inva&s;ion, the plan of an in&s;urrection at home, the &s;cheme for her delivery, and the con&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating the u&s;urper by &s;ix noble gentlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal which they bore the catholic cau&s;e, and her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, would undertake the tragical execution. To the&s;e Mary replied, that &s;he approved highly of the de&s;ign; that the gentlemen might ex|pect
<PB N="114" REF="116">
all the rewards which it &s;hould be ever in her power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance, pre|vious to any further attempts either for her delivery, or the intended in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;cheme laid by the con&s;pira|tors; and nothing &s;eemed &s;o certain as its &s;e|crecy and its &s;ucce&s;s. But they were all mi|&s;erably deceived; the active and &s;agacious mi|ni&s;ters of Elizabeth were privy to it in every &s;tage of its growth, and only retarded their di&s;covery till the meditated guilt was ripe for puni&s;hment and conviction. Ballard was ac|tually attended by one Maude, a catholic prie&s;t, who was a &s;py in pay with Wal&s;ingham, &s;e|cretary of &s;tate. One Polly, another of his &s;pies, had found means to in&s;inuate him&s;elf among the con&s;pirators, and to give an exact account of their proceedings. Soon after one Giffard a prie&s;t came over, and di&s;covering the whole con&s;piracy to the bottom, made a ten|der of his &s;ervice to Wal&s;ingham. It was he that procured the letters to be conveyed thro' the wall to the queen, and received her an&s;wers; but he had always taken care to &s;hew them to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who had them deci|phered, and took copies of them all.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">The plot being thus ripe for execution, and the evidence again&s;t the con&s;pirators inconte&s;t|ible, Wal&s;ingham re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend their pu|ni&s;hment no longer. A warrant was accord|ingly i&s;&s;ued out for the apprehending of Bal|lard; and this giving the alarm to Babington, and the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators, they covered them&s;elves with various di&s;gui&s;es, and endea|voured to keep them&s;elves concealed. But they were &s;oon di&s;covered, thrown into pri&s;on, and brought to trial. In their examination they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and exe|cuted, &s;even of whom died acknowledging their crime.</P>
<P>The execution of the&s;e wretched men only prepared the way for one of &s;till greater im|portance, in which a captive queen was to &s;ub|mit to the unju&s;t deci&s;ions of tho&s;e who had no right, but that of power, to condemn her. Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington's con&s;piracy, every ave|nue to the unfortunate Mary was &s;o &s;trictly guarded, that &s;he remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter. But her a&s;toni&s;hment was equal to her angui&s;h, when &s;ir Thomas Gor|ges, by Elizabeth's order, came to inform her
<PB N="116" REF="118">
of the fate of her unhappy confederates. She was at that time mounted on hor&s;e-back, going a-hunting; and was not permitted to return to her former place of abode, but con|ducted from one gentleman's hou&s;e to another, till &s;he was lodged in Fotheringay ca&s;tle, in Northampton&s;hire, where the la&s;t &s;cene of her mi&s;erable tragedy was to conclude.</P>
<P>The council of England was divided in opinion about the mea&s;ures to be taken a|gain&s;t the queen of Scots. Some members propo&s;ed, that as her health was very infirm, her life might be &s;hortened by clo&s;e confine|ment; therefore to avoid any imputation of vio|lence or cruelty, the earl of Leice&s;ter propo&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould be di&s;patched by poi&s;on; but the majority in&s;i&s;ted on her being put to death by legal proce&s;s. Accordingly a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued to forty peers, with five judges, or the major part of them, to try and pa&s;s &s;en|tence upon Mary, daughter and heir of James the fifth, king of Scotland, commonly called queen of Scots, and dowager of France.</P>
<P>Thirty &s;ix of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners arriving at the ca&s;tle of Fotheringay,<MILESTONE N="Nov. 11, 1586."> pre&s;ented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to &s;ub|mit to a trial for her late con&s;piracy. Mary peru&s;ed the letter with great compo&s;ure; and
<PB N="117" REF="119">
as &s;he had long fore&s;een the danger that hung over her, received the intelligence without emotion or a&s;toni&s;hment. She &s;aid, however, that &s;he wondered the queen of England &s;hould command her as a &s;ubject, who was an inde|pendent &s;overeign, and a queen like her&s;elf. She would never, &s;he &s;aid, &s;toop to any con|de&s;cen&s;ion which would le&s;&s;en her dignity, or prejudice the claims of her po&s;terity. The laws of England, &s;he ob&s;erved, were unknown to her; &s;he was de&s;titute of coun&s;el; nor could &s;he conceive who were to be her peers, as &s;he had but one equal in the kingdom. She add|ed, that in&s;tead of enjoying the protection of the laws of England, as &s;he had hoped to ob|tain, &s;he had been confined in pri&s;on ever &s;ince her arrival in the kingdom; &s;o that &s;he derived neither benefit, nor &s;ecurity from them. When the commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;ubmit to the queen's plea&s;ure, otherwi&s;e they would proceed again&s;t her as contumacious, &s;he declared &s;he would rather &s;uffer a thou|&s;and deaths, than own her&s;elf a &s;ubject to any prince on earth. That, however, &s;he was ready to vindicate her&s;elf in a full and free parliament, as for aught &s;he knew, this meet|ing of commi&s;&s;ioners was devi&s;ed again&s;t her life, on purpo&s;e to take it away with a pretext
<PB N="118" REF="120">
of ju&s;tice. She exhorted them to con&s;ult their own con&s;ciences, and to remember that the theatre of the world was much more exten&s;ive than that of the kingdom of England. At length, the vice-chamberlain Hatton vanqui&s;h|ed her objections, by repre&s;enting that &s;he in|jured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her innocence might be proved to the &s;atisfaction of all mankind. This ob&s;ervation made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon her, that &s;he agreed to plead, if they would admit and al|low her prote&s;t, of di&s;allowing all &s;ubjection. This, however, they refu&s;ed; but they &s;atisfied her, by entering it upon record, and thus they proceeded to a trial.</P>
<P>The principal charge again&s;t her was urged by &s;erjeant Gaudy, who accu&s;ed her with knowing, approving, and con&s;enting to Ba|bington's con&s;piracy. This charge was &s;up|ported by Babington's confe&s;&s;ion, by the co|pies which were taken of their corre&s;pondence, in which her approbation of the queen's mur|der was expre&s;ly declared, by the evidence of her own two &s;ecretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scotchman, who &s;wore that &s;he received Babington's letters, and that they had an&s;wered them by her orders. The&s;e were &s;till further confirmed by the te&s;timony of Bal|lard
<PB N="119" REF="121">
and Savage, to whom Babington had &s;hewn the&s;e letters, declaring them to have come from the captive queen. To the&s;e charges Mary made a &s;en&s;ible and re&s;o|lute defence; &s;he &s;aid Babington's confe&s;&s;ion was extorted from his fears of the torture, which was really the ca&s;e; &s;he alledged, that the letters were forgeries; and &s;he defied her &s;ecretaries to per&s;i&s;t in their evidence, if brought into her pre&s;ence. She owned, indeed, that &s;he had u&s;ed her be&s;t endeavours to recover her liberty, which was only pur&s;uing the dic|tates of nature; but as for harbouring a thought again&s;t the life of the queen, &s;he treated the idea with horror. During the cour&s;e of the trial, as a letter between Mary and Babington was reading, mention was made in it of the earl of Arundel and his brothers. On hearing their names &s;he &s;hed a flood of tears, exclaiming, Alas! what hath the noble hou&s;e of the Howards endured for my &s;ake! She took occa&s;ion al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that his let|ter might have been a ba&s;e contrivance of Wal&s;ingham's, who had frequently practi&s;ed both again&s;t her life and her &s;on's. Wal&s;ing|ham thus accu&s;ed ro&s;e up, and prote&s;ted that his heart was free from malice; that he had never done any thing unbecoming an hone&s;t
<PB N="120" REF="122">
man in his private capacity, nor aught unwor|thy of the place he occupied in the &s;tate. Mary declared her&s;elf &s;atisfied of his inno|cence, and begged he would give as little cre|dit to the malicious accu&s;ations of her ene|mies, as &s;he now gave to the reports which &s;he had heard to his prejudice.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been this queeen's offences, it is certain that her treatment was very &s;evere. She de&s;ired to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch notes as &s;he had taken preparative to her trial; but this was refu&s;ed her. She demanded a copy of her prote&s;t; but her re|que&s;t was not complied with; &s;he even required an advocate to plead her cau&s;e again&s;t &s;o many learned lawyers, as had undertaken to urge her accu&s;ations, but all her demands were re|jected; and, after an adjournment of &s;ome days, &s;entence of death was pronounced again&s;t her in the Star-chamber in We&s;tmin&s;ter, all the commi&s;&s;ioners, except two, being pre&s;ent. At the &s;ame time a declaration was publi&s;hed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, implying, that the &s;en|tence again&s;t her did no wi&s;e derogate from the title and honour of James, king of Scot|land, &s;on to the attainted queen.</P>
<P>Though the condemning a &s;overeign prin|ce&s;s at a tribunal to which &s;he owed no &s;ub|jection,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
was an inju&s;tice that mu&s;t &s;trike the mo&s;t inattentive, yet the parliament of Eng|land, who met four days after,<MILESTONE N="Oct. 29, 1586."> did not fail to approve the &s;entence, and to go &s;till farther, in pre&s;enting an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;iring that it might &s;peedily be put into execution. But Elizabeth &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or pretended to po&s;&s;e&s;s, an horror for &s;uch precipitate &s;everity. She entreated them to find &s;ome expedient to &s;ave her from the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a &s;tep &s;o repugnant to her inclination. But at the &s;ame time &s;he &s;eemed to dread another con&s;pi|racy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her within a month, which probably was only an artifice of her mini&s;ters to encrea&s;e her apprehen&s;ions, and con&s;equent|ly her de&s;ire of being rid of a rival, that had given her &s;o much di&s;turbance. The parlia|ment, however, reiterated their &s;ollicitations, arguments, and entreaties; and even remon|&s;trated, that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her &s;ubjects, and her children. Elizabeth affected to continue inflexible; but at the &s;ame time permitted Mary's &s;entence to be made public; and lord Buckhur&s;t, and Beale, clerk to the council, were &s;ent to the unhappy queen to apprize her of the &s;entence, and the popular clamour for its &s;peedy exe|cution.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">Upon receiving this dreadful information, Mary &s;eemed no way moved; but in&s;i&s;ted that &s;ince her death was demanded by the prote&s;t|ants, &s;he died a martyr to the catholic re|ligion. She &s;aid, that as the Engli&s;h often embrued their hands in the blood of their own &s;overeigns, it was not to be wondered at that they exerci&s;ed their cruelty towards her. She wrote her la&s;t letter to Elizabeth, not demand|ing her life, which &s;he now &s;eemed willing to part with, but de&s;iring, that after her enemies &s;hould be &s;atiated with her innocent blood, her body might be con&s;igned to her &s;ervants, and conveyed to France, there to repo&s;e in a catholic country, with the &s;acred reliques of her mother.</P>
<P>In the mean time, accounts of this extraor|dinary &s;entence were &s;pread into all parts of Europe; and the king of France was among the foremo&s;t who attempted to avert the threatened blow. He &s;ent over Believre as an extraordinary amba&s;&s;ador, with a profe&s;&s;ed intention of interceding for the life of Mary. But James of Scotland, her &s;on, was, as in duty obliged, &s;till more pre&s;&s;ing in her behalf. He di&s;patched one Keith, a gentleman of his bed-chamber, with a letter to Elizabeth, con|juring her to &s;pare the life of his parent, and
<PB N="123" REF="125">
miring threats of vengeance, in ca&s;e of a refu|&s;al. Elizabeth, however, treated his remon|&s;trances with the utmo&s;t indignation; and when the Scotch amba&s;&s;ador begged that the execution might be put off for a week, the queen an&s;wered with great emotion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, not for an hour."</Q>
Thus Elizabeth, when &s;ol|licited by foreign princes to pardon the queen of Scots, &s;eemed always di&s;po&s;ed to proceed to extremities again&s;t her; but when her mini|&s;ters urged her to &s;trike the blow, her &s;cruples and her reluctance &s;eemed to return.</P>
<P>Whether the queen was really &s;incere in her reluctance to execute Mary, is a que&s;tion which, though u&s;ually given again&s;t her, I will not take upon me to determine. Certain|ly there were great arts u&s;ed by her courtiers to determine her to the &s;ide of &s;everity; as they had every thing to fear from the re&s;ent|ment of Mary, in ca&s;e &s;he ever &s;ucceeded to the throne. Accordingly, the kingdom was now filled with rumours of plots, trea&s;ons, and in&s;urrections; and the queen was continually kept in alarm by fictitious dangers. She, therefore, appeared to be in great terror and perplexity; &s;he was ob&s;erved to &s;it much alone, and to mutter to her&s;elf half &s;entences, import|ing the difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s to which &s;he was
<PB N="124" REF="126">
reduced. In this &s;ituation, &s;he one day called her &s;ecretary, Davi&s;on, whom &s;he ordered to draw out &s;ecretly the warrant for Mary's exe|cution, informing him, that &s;he intended to keep it by her in ca&s;e any attempt &s;hould be made for the delivery of that prince&s;s. She &s;igned the warrant, and then commanded it to be carried to the chancellor to have the &s;eal affixed to it. Next morning, however, &s;he &s;ent two gentlemen &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to de&s;ire that Davi&s;on would not go to the chancellor, until &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him; but Davi&s;on telling her that the warrant had been already &s;ealed, &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at his precipitation. Davi&s;on, who probably wi&s;hed him&s;elf to &s;ee the &s;entence executed, laid the affair before the council, who unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the warrant &s;hould be immediately put in exe|cution, and promi&s;ed to ju&s;tify Davi&s;on to the queen. Accordingly, the fatal in&s;trument was delivered to Beale, who &s;ummoned the noble|men to whom it was directed, namely, the earls of Shrew&s;bery, Derby, Kent, and Cum|berland, and the&s;e together &s;et out for Fother|ingay ca&s;tle, accompanied by two execution|ers, to di&s;patch their bloody commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mary heard of the arrival of her execution|ers, who ordered her to prepare for death by
<PB N="125" REF="127">
eight o'clock the next morning. Without any alarm &s;he heard the death-warrant read with her u&s;ual compo&s;ure, though &s;he could not help expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urprize, that the queen of England &s;hould con&s;ent to her execution. She even abjured her being privy to any con|&s;piracy again&s;t Elizabeth, by laying her hand upon a New Te&s;tament, which happened to lie on the table. She de&s;ired that her confe&s;|&s;or might be permitted to attend her, which, however, the&s;e zealots refu&s;ed. After the earls had retired, &s;he ate &s;paringly at &s;upper, while &s;he comforted her attendants, who con|tinued weeping and lamenting their mi&s;tre&s;s, with a chearful countenance, telling them, they ought not to mourn, but rejoice, at the pro&s;pect of her &s;peedy deliverance from a world of mi&s;ery. Towards the end of &s;upper, &s;he called in all her &s;ervants, and drank to them; they pledged her in order on their knees, and craved her pardon for any pa&s;t neglect of duty. She craved mutual forgive|ne&s;s; and a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears attended this la&s;t &s;olemn &s;eparation.</P>
<P>After this, &s;he reviewed her will, and pe|ru&s;ed the inventory of her effects. The&s;e &s;he bequeathed to different individuals, and divid|ed her money among her dome&s;tics, recom|mending
<PB N="126" REF="128">
them in letters to the king of France, and the duke of Gui&s;e. Then going to bed at her u&s;ual hour, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed part of the night in uninterrupted repo&s;e; and ri&s;ing, &s;pent the remainder in prayer, and acts of devotion. Towards morning, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf in a rich habit of &s;ilk and velvet, the only one which &s;he had re&s;erved for this &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ion. Thomas Andrews, the under-&s;heriff of the country, then entering the room, he informed her that the hour was come, and that he mu&s;t attend her to the place of execution. She replied, that &s;he was ready; and bidding her &s;ervants farewel, &s;he proceeded, &s;upported by two of her guards, and followed the &s;heriff, with a &s;erene compo&s;ed a&s;pect, with a long veil of linen on her head, and in her hand a crucifix of ivory. In pa&s;&s;ing through an hall adjoining to her chamber, Sir Andrew Melvil, ma&s;ter of her hou&s;hold, fell upon his knees, and &s;hedding a flood of tears, lamented his misfortune, in being doomed to carry the news of her unhappy fate to Scotland.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lament not, &s;aid &s;he, but rather rejoice. Mary Stuart will &s;oon be freed from all her cares. Tell my friends that I die con&s;tant in my religion, and firm in my affection and fideli|ty to Scotland and France. God forgive
<PB N="127" REF="129">
them that have long de&s;ired my end, and have thir&s;ted for my blood, as the heart panteth for the water-brook. Thou O God, who art truth it&s;elf, and perfectly under|&s;tande&s;t the inmo&s;t thoughts of my heart, knowe&s;t how greatly I have de&s;ired that the realms of Scotland and England might be united.

Ad|moni&s;h him to per&s;evere in amity and friend|&s;hip with the queen of England, and &s;ee that thou do&s;t him faithful &s;ervice. And &s;o good Melvil farewel; once again fare|wel, good Melvil, and grant the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy prayers to thy queen and thy mi&s;tre&s;s."</Q>
In this place &s;he was received by the four noblemen, who with great difficulty were pre|vailed upon to allow Melvil, with her phy&s;i|cian, apothecary, and two female attendants, to be pre&s;ent at her execution. She then pa&s;|&s;ed into another hall, the noblemen and the &s;heriff going before, and Melvil bearing up her train; where was a &s;caffold erected and covered with black. As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;eated, Beale began to read the warrant for her execution. Then Fletcher, dean of Peter|borough, &s;tanding without the rails, repeated
<PB N="128" REF="130">
a long exhortation, which &s;he de&s;ired him to forbear, as &s;he was firmly re&s;olved to die in the catholic religion. The room was crowded with &s;pectators, who beheld her with pity and di&s;tre&s;s, while her beauty, though dimmed by age and affliction, gleamed through her &s;uffer|ings, and was &s;till remarkable in this fatal mo|ment. The earl of Kent ob&s;erving, that in her devotions &s;he made frequent u&s;e of the crucifix, he could not forbear reproving her, exhorting her to have Chri&s;t in her heart, not in her hand. She replied, with pre&s;ence of mind, that it was difficult to hold &s;uch an object in her hand, without feeling her heart touched for the &s;ufferings of him whom it repre|&s;ented. She now began, with the aid of her two women, to undre&s;s for the block; and the executioner al&s;o lent his hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. She &s;miled, and &s;aid that &s;he was not accu&s;tom|ed to undre&s;s her&s;elf before &s;o large a com|pany, nor to be attended by &s;uch &s;ervants. Her two women bur&s;ting into tears, and loud exclamations of &s;orrow, &s;he turned about to them, put her finger upon her lips, as a &s;ign of impo&s;ing &s;ilence upon them; and having given them her ble&s;&s;ing, de&s;ired their prayers in return. The two executioners kneeling, and a&s;king her pardon, &s;he &s;aid &s;he forgave them,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
and all the authors of her death, as freely as &s;he hoped forgivene&s;s from her Maker, and then once more made a &s;olemn prote&s;tation of her innocence. Her eyes were then covered with a linen handkerchief; and &s;he laid her&s;elf down without any fear or trepidation. Then reciting a p&s;alm, and repeating a pious ejacu|lation, her head was &s;evered from her body at two &s;trokes by the executioner. He in&s;tant|ly held it up to the &s;pectators, &s;treaming with blood, and agitated with the convul&s;ions of death; the dean of Peterborough alone ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"So peri&s;h all queen Elizabeth's enemies."</Q> The earl of Kent replied Amen, while the re&s;t of the &s;pectators wept and &s;ighed at this affecting &s;pectacle; for flat|tery and zeal alike gave place to &s;tronger and better emotions. Thus died Mary, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and the nineteenth of her captivity, a prince&s;s unmatched in beauty, and unequalled in misfortunes. In contemplating the contentions of mankind, we find almo&s;t ever both &s;ides culpable; Mary, who was &s;tained with crimes that de&s;erved pu|ni&s;hment, was put to death by a prince&s;s who had no ju&s;t preten&s;ions to inflict puni&s;hment on her equal.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132">It is difficult to be certain of the true &s;tate of Elizabeth's mind, upon receiving the fir&s;t accounts of the death of Mary. Hi&s;torians in general are willing to a&s;cribe the extreme &s;orrow &s;he te&s;tified on that occa&s;ion to fal&s;e|hood and deep di&s;&s;imulation. But where is the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;cribing to bad motives, what &s;eems to proceed from a more generous &s;cource? There is nothing more certain, than that, upon hearing the news, &s;he te&s;tified the utmo&s;t &s;urprize and indignation. Her coun|tenance changed, her &s;peech faltered and failed her, and &s;he &s;tood fixed for a long time in mute a&s;toni&s;hment. When the fir&s;t bur&s;t of &s;orrow was over, &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her re&s;entment again&s;t her mini&s;ters, none of whom dared to approach her. She committed Davi&s;on to pri&s;on, and ordered him to be tried in the Star-chamber for this mi&s;demeanor. He was condemned to impri&s;onment during the queen's, plea&s;ure, and to pay a fine of ten thou|&s;and pounds; in con&s;equence of which he re|mained a long time in cu&s;tody, and the fine, though it reduced him to want and beggary, was rigorou&s;ly levied upon him. It is likely therefore that Elizabeth was &s;incere enough in her anger for the fate of Mary; as it was an event likely to brand her reign with the cha|racter
<PB N="131" REF="133">
of cruelty, and though &s;he might have de&s;ired her rival's death, yet &s;he mu&s;t certainly be &s;hocked at the manner of it.</P>
<P>But the unea&s;ine&s;s the queen felt from this di&s;agreeable forwardne&s;s of her mini&s;try, was &s;oon lo&s;t in one much greater. Philip, who had long meditated the de&s;truction of Eng|land, and who&s;e exten&s;ive power gave him grounds to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, now began to put his projects into execution. The point on which he re&s;ted his glory, and the perpetual object of his &s;chemes, was to &s;upport the catholic religion, and exterminate the reformation. The revolt of his &s;ubjects in the Netherlands &s;till more enflamed his re&s;entment again&s;t the Engli&s;h, as they had encouraged that in&s;ur|rection, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the revolters. He had, therefore, for &s;ome time been making prepa|rations to attack England by a powerful in|va&s;ion; and now every part of his va&s;t empire re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of armaments, and every art was u&s;ed to levy &s;upplies for that great de&s;ign. The marquis of Santa Croce, a &s;ea officer of great reputation and experi|ence, was de&s;tined to command the fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and thirty ve&s;|&s;els, of a greater &s;ize than any that had been hitherto &s;een in Europe. The duke of Parma
<PB N="132" REF="134">
was to conduct the land forces, twenty thou|&s;and of whom were on board the fleet, and thirty-four thou&s;and more were a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands, ready to be tran&s;ported into England. The mo&s;t renowned nobi|lity and princes of Italy and Spain, were ambitious of &s;haring in the honour of this great enterprize. Don Amadaeus of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Gonzaga, duke of Sabionetta, and others, ha&s;tened to join this great equipment; no doubt was entertained of its &s;ucce&s;s, and it was o&s;tentatiou&s;ly &s;tyled the Invincible Armada. It carried on board, be&s;ide the land forces, eight thou&s;and four hundred mariners, two thou&s;and galley-&s;laves, and two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty great pieces of bra&s;s ordnance. It was victualled for &s;ix months, and was attended with twenty le&s;&s;er &s;hips, called Caravals, and ten Salves, with &s;ix oars a-piece.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the terror and con|&s;ternation which all ranks of people felt in England upon news of this terrible Armada being under &s;ail to invade them. A fleet of not above thirty &s;hips of war, and tho&s;e very &s;mall, in compari&s;on, was all that was to op|po&s;e it by &s;ea; and as for re&s;i&s;ting by land, that was &s;uppo&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible, as the

Spani&s;h army was compo&s;ed of men well di&s;|ciplined, and long enured to danger. The queen alone &s;eemed undi&s;mayed in this threat|ening calamity; &s;he i&s;&s;ued all her orders with tranquility, animated her people to a &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance; and the more to excite the martial &s;pirit of the nation, &s;he appeared on hor&s;eback in the camp at Tilbury, exhorting the &s;oldiers to their duty, and promi&s;ing to &s;hare the &s;ame dangers, and the &s;ame fate with them.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I my&s;elf, cried &s;he, will be your general, your judge, and the rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. Your alacrity has already de&s;erved its rewards; and on the word of a prince they &s;hall be duly paid you. Per&s;evere then in your obedience to command, &s;hew your valour in the field, and we &s;hall &s;oon have a glorious victory over tho&s;e enemies of my God, my kingdom, and my people."</Q>
The &s;oldiers with &s;houts proclaimed their ardour, and only wi&s;hed to be led on to conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor were her preparations by &s;ea driven on with le&s;s alacrity; although the Engli&s;h fleet was much inferior in number and &s;ize of &s;hip|ping to that of the enemy, yet it was much more manageable, the dexterity and courage of the mariners being greatly &s;uperior.

Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity, as lord Admiral, took on him the command of the navy. Drake, Hawkins, and Frobi&s;her, the mo&s;t renowned &s;eamen in Europe, &s;erved under him; while a &s;mall &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ting of forty ve&s;&s;els, Engli&s;h and Flemi&s;h, commanded by lord Seymour, lay off Dunkirk, in order to inter|cept the duke of Parma. This was the pre|paration made by the Engli&s;h, while all the prote&s;tant powers of Europe regarded this enterpize as the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Spani&s;h Arma|da was preparing to &s;ail, the admiral Santa Croce died, as likewi&s;e the vice admiral Pa|liano; and the command of the expedition was given to the duke de Medina Sidonia, a per&s;on utterly unexperienced in &s;ea affairs; and this, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign. But &s;ome other accidents al&s;o con|tributed to its failure. Upon leaving the port of Li&s;bon, the Armada next day met with a violent tempe&s;t, which &s;unk &s;ome of the &s;mall|e&s;t of their &s;hipping, and obliged the fleet to put back into harbour. After &s;ome time &s;pent in refitting, they again put to &s;ea; where they took a fi&s;herman, who gave them intelligence
<PB N="135" REF="137">
that the Engli&s;h fleet, hearing of the di&s;per&s;ion of the Armada in a &s;torm, was retired back in|to Plymouth harbour, and mo&s;t of the ma|riners di&s;charged. From this fal&s;e intelli|gence, the Spani&s;h admiral, in&s;tead of going directly to the coa&s;t of Flanders, to take in the troops &s;tationed there, as he had been in&s;truct|ed, re&s;olved to &s;ail to Plymouth, and de&s;troy the &s;hipping laid up in that harbour. But Ef|fingham, the Engli&s;h admiral, was very well prepared to receive them; he was ju&s;t got out of port when he &s;aw the Spani&s;h Armada com|ing full &s;ail towards him, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of an half moon, and &s;tretching &s;even miles from one extremity to the other. However the Engli&s;h admiral, &s;econded by Drake, Haw|kins, and Frobi&s;her, attacked the Armada at a di&s;tance, pouring in their broad&s;ides with admirable dexterity. They did not chu&s;e to engage the enemy more clo&s;ely, becau&s;e they were greatly inferior in the number of &s;hips, guns, and weight of metal; nor could they pretend to board &s;uch lofty &s;hips without ma|nife&s;t di&s;advantage. However, two Spani&s;h galleons were di&s;abled and taken. As the Ar|mada advanced up the Channel, the Engli&s;h &s;till followed and infe&s;ted their rear; and their fleet continually encrea&s;ing from different ports,
<PB N="136" REF="138">
they &s;oon found them&s;elves in a capacity to attack the Spani&s;h fleet more nearly; and ac|cordingly fell upon them, while they were as yet taking &s;helter in the port of Calais. To encrea&s;e their confu&s;ion, Howard took eight of his &s;maller &s;hips, and filling them with com|bu&s;tible materials, &s;ent them, as if they had been fire &s;hips, one after the other into the mid&s;t of the enemy. The Spaniards, taking them for what they &s;eemed to be, immediately took flight in great di&s;order; while the Eng|li&s;h, profiting by their panic, took or de&s;troyed about twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to Spain; the duke de Medina Sidonia being thus driven to the coa&s;t of Zealand, held a council of war, in which it was re&s;olved, that as their ammuni|tion began to fail, as their &s;hips had received great damage, and the duke of Parma had re|fu&s;ed to venture his army under their protec|tion, they &s;hould return to Spain by &s;ailing round the Orkneys, as the winds were con|trary to his pa&s;&s;age directly back. Accord|ingly they proceeded northward, and were fol|lowed by the Engli&s;h fleet as far as Flambo|rough-head, where they were terribly &s;hattered by a &s;torm. Seventeen of the &s;hips, having five thou&s;and men on board, were afterwards
<PB N="137" REF="139">
ca&s;t away upon the we&s;tern i&s;les, and the coa&s;t of Ireland. Of the whole Armada, three and fifty &s;hips only returned to Spain, in a mi&s;er|able condition; and the &s;eamen as well as &s;ol|diers who remained, only &s;erved, by their ac|counts, to intimidate their countrymen from attempting to renew &s;o dangerous an expedi|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters of the Spani&s;h Armada, &s;erved only to excite the &s;pirit and courage of the Engli&s;h, to attempt inva&s;ions in their turn. It would be endle&s;s to relate all the advantages obtained over the enemy at &s;ea, where the cap|ture of every &s;hip mu&s;t have been made a &s;epa|rate narrative; or their various de&s;cents upon different parts of the coa&s;t, which were attended with effects too tran&s;ient for the page of hi&s;tory. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ea captains of that reign are &s;till con&s;idered as the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t enterprizing &s;et of men that England ever produced; and among this number, we reckon our Rawleigh, and Howard, our Drake, our Cavendi&s;h, and Hawkins. The Engli&s;h navy then fir&s;t began to take the lead; and has &s;ince continued irre&s;i&s;tible in all parts of the ocean.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who made the mo&s;t &s;ignal figure in the&s;e depredations upon Spain, was the
<PB N="138" REF="140">
young earl of E&s;&s;ex, a nobleman of great bra|very, genero&s;ity, and genius; and fitted, not only for the foremo&s;t ranks in war by his valour, but to conduct the intrigues of a court by his eloquence and addre&s;s. But with all the&s;e en|dowments, both of body and mind, he wanted prudence; being impetuous, haughty, and to|tally incapable of advice or controul. The earl of Leice&s;ter had died &s;ome time before, and now left room in the queen's affections for a new favourite, which &s;he was not long in chu&s;ing, &s;ince the merit, the bravery, and the popularity of E&s;&s;ex, were too great not to en|gage her attention. Elizabeth, though &s;he rejected an hu&s;band, yet appeared always pa&s;|&s;ionately de&s;irous of a lover; and flattery had rendered her &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to her want of beauty, and the depredations of age, that &s;he &s;till thought her&s;elf as powerful by her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments as by her authority. The new favourite was young, active, ambitious, witty, and hand&s;ome; in the field, and at court, he always appeared with &s;uperior lu&s;tre. In all the ma&s;ques which were then performed, the earl and Elizabeth were generally coupled as partners; and although &s;he was almo&s;t &s;ixty, and he not half &s;o old, yet her vanity over|looked the di&s;parity; the world told her that &s;he
<PB N="139" REF="141">
was young, and &s;he her&s;elf was willing to think &s;o. This young earl's intere&s;t in the queen's affec|tions, as may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, promoted his intere&s;ts in the &s;tate; and he conducted all things at his di&s;cretion. But young and unex|perienced as he was, he at length began to fancy that the popularity he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the flatteries he received, were given to his merits and not to his favour. His jealou&s;y al&s;o of lord Burleigh, who was his only rival in power, made him &s;till more untractable; and the many &s;ucce&s;&s;es he had obtained again&s;t the Spaniards, encrea&s;ed his confidence. In a debate before the queen, between him and Burleigh, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was &s;o heated in the argument, that he entirely forgot both the rules and duties of civility. He turn|ed his back on the queen in a contemptuous manner, which &s;o provoked her re&s;entment, that &s;he in&s;tantly gave him a box on the ear. In&s;tead of recollecting him&s;elf, and making the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions due to her &s;ex and &s;tation, he clapped his hand to his &s;word; and &s;wore he would not bear &s;uch u&s;age even from her fa|ther. This offence, though very great, was overlooked by the queen; her partiality was &s;o prevalent, that &s;he re-in&s;tated him in his former favour, and her kindne&s;s &s;eemed to
<PB N="140" REF="142">
have acquired new force from that &s;hort in|terruption of anger and re&s;entment. The death al&s;o of his rival, lord Burleigh, which happen|ed &s;hortly after, &s;eemed to confirm his power.</P>
<P>But though few men were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of E&s;|&s;ex's talents, both for war and peace, yet he had not art enough to guard again&s;t the in|trigues of a court; his temper was too candid and open, and gave his enemies many advan|tages over him. At that time the earl of Ty|rone headed the rebellious natives of Ireland; who, not yet thoroughly brought into &s;ubjection to the Engli&s;h, took every opportunity to make incur&s;ions upon the more civilized inhabitants, and &s;lew all they were able to overpower. To &s;ubdue the&s;e was an employment that E&s;&s;ex thought worthy of his ambition; nor were his enemies di&s;plea&s;ed at thus removing a man from court, where he ob&s;tructed all their private aims of preferment. But it ended in his ruin.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex, upon entering on his new command in Ireland, employed his friend, the earl of Southampton, who was long obnoxious to the queen, as general of his hor&s;e; nor was it till after repeated orders from Elizabeth, that he could be prevailed on to di&s;place him. This indi&s;cretion was followed by another; in&s;tead of attacking the enemy in their grand retreat
<PB N="141" REF="143">
in Ul&s;ter, he led his forces into the province of Mun&s;ter, where he only exhau&s;ted his &s;trength, and lo&s;t his opportunity again&s;t a people that &s;ubmitted at his approach, but took up arms again when he retired. It may ea&s;ily be &s;up|po&s;ed, that the&s;e mi&s;carriages were urged by the enemies of E&s;&s;ex at home; but they had &s;till greater rea&s;on to attack his reputation, when it was known, that in&s;tead of humbling the rebels, he had only treated with them; and in&s;tead of forcing them to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he had concluded a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities. This i&s;&s;ue of an enterprize, from which much was ex|pected, did not fail to provoke the queen mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly; and her anger was &s;till more height|ened by the peevi&s;h and impatient letters, which he daily wrote to her and the council. But her re&s;entment again&s;t him was &s;till more ju&s;tly let loo&s;e, when &s;he found, that leaving the place of his appointment, and without any permi&s;&s;ion demanded or obtained, he had re|turned from Ireland to make his complaints to her&s;elf in per&s;on.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, indeed, Elizabeth was plea&s;ed at &s;ee|ing a favourite come back, whom &s;he longed to &s;ee; but the momentary &s;atisfaction of his unex|pected appearance being over, &s;he reflected on the impropriety of his conduct with greater
<PB N="142" REF="144">
&s;everity; and ordered him to remain a pri&s;oner at his own hou&s;e. But this was a reception E&s;&s;ex was not unprepared for: he u&s;ed every expre&s;&s;ion of humiliation and &s;orrow, and tried once more, the long unpracti&s;ed arts of in&s;inuation that had brought him into favour. The queen, however, &s;till continuing inflexible, he re&s;olved to give up every pro&s;pect of ambition; but pre|vious to his retiring into the country, he a&s;&s;ured the queen, that he could never be happy till he again &s;aw tho&s;e eyes, which were u&s;ed to &s;hine upon him with &s;uch lu&s;tre; that, in expectance of that happy moment, he would, like another Nebuchadnezzar, dwell with the bea&s;ts of the field, and be wet with the dew of heaven, till &s;he again propitiou&s;ly took pity on his &s;uffer|ings. This romantic me&s;&s;age, which was quite in the breeding of the times, &s;eemed peculiarly plea&s;ing to the queen; &s;he thought him &s;incere from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own &s;incerity; &s;he, therefore replied, that after &s;ome time, when convinced of his &s;incerity, &s;omething might be expected from her lenity. When the&s;e &s;ymptoms of the queen's returning af|fection were known, they equally renewed the fears of his real enemies, and the a&s;&s;iduities of his pretended friends. He did not, therefore, decline an examination of his conduct before
<PB N="143" REF="145">
the council, &s;ecure in his mi&s;tre&s;s's favour, and their impotence to do him a real injury. In con&s;equence of this, he was only &s;entenced for his late mi&s;conduct, to re&s;ign his employments, and to continue a pri&s;oner in his own hou&s;e, till her maje&s;ty's further plea&s;ure &s;hould be known.</P>
<P>He now, therefore, had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,<MILESTONE N="1600" UNIT="A.D."> triumphed over his enemies; and the di&s;cre|tion of a few months might have rein&s;tated him in all his former employments; but the impetuo&s;ity of his character would not &s;uffer him to wait for a &s;low redre&s;s of what he con|&s;idered as wrongs; and the queen's refu&s;ing his reque&s;t to continue him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lucrative monopoly of &s;weet wines, which he had long enjoyed, &s;purred him on to the mo&s;t violent and guilty mea&s;ures. Having long built with fond credulity on his great popu|larity, he began to hope, from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the giddy multitude, that revenge upon his enemies in the council, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was denied him from the throne. With the&s;e aims he began to encrea&s;e the general propen|&s;ity in his favour, by an ho&s;pitality little &s;uited to his &s;ituation, or his circum&s;tances. He en|tertained men of all ranks and profe&s;&s;ions; but particularly the military, whom he hoped
<PB N="144" REF="146">
in his pre&s;ent views might be &s;erviceable to him. But his greate&s;t dependence was up|on the profe&s;&s;ions of the citizens of Lon|don, who&s;e &s;chemes of religion and govern|ment he appeared entirely to approve; and while he gratified the puritans by railing at the government of the church, he plea&s;ed the en|vious, by expo&s;ing the faults of tho&s;e in pow|er. However the chief &s;everity of his cen&s;ure was heard to re&s;t upon the queen, whom he did not he&s;itate to ridicule; and of whom he declared that &s;he was now become an old wo|man, and that her mind was grown as crooked as her body.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that none of the&s;e indi&s;cretions were concealed from the queen; his enemies, and her emi&s;&s;aries, took care to bring her information of all his re&s;entments and aims, and to aggravate his &s;lighte&s;t re|flections into trea&s;on. Elizabeth was ever re|markably jealous where her beauty was in que&s;tion; and though &s;he was now in her &s;eventieth year, yet &s;he eagerly li&s;tened to all the flattery of her courtiers, when they called her a Venus, or an Angel. She, therefore, began to con&s;ider him as unworthy of her e&s;teem, and permitted his enemies to drive him to tho&s;e extremities to which he was na|turally
<PB N="145" REF="147">
very well inclined to proceed. He had, in fact, by this time collected together a &s;elect council of malcontents, who flattered him in his wild projects; and, &s;uppo&s;ing their adherents much more numerous than they really were, they took no pains to conceal their intentions. Among other criminal projects, the re&s;ult of blind rage and de&s;pair, they re&s;olv|ed at la&s;t that Sir Chri&s;topher Blount, one of his creatures, &s;hould, with a choice detach|ment, po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the palace gates; that Sir John Davis &s;hould &s;eize the hall, Sir Charles Davers the guard-chamber, while E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf would ru&s;h in from the Meu&s;e, attended by a body of his partizans, into the queen's pre&s;ence, entreat her to remove his and her enemies, to a&s;&s;emble a new parlia|ment, and to correct the defects of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It was the fortune of this queen's reign, that all projects again&s;t it were fru&s;trated by a timely notice of their nature and intent. The queen and council, alarmed at the great re&s;ort of people to E&s;&s;ex, and having &s;ome intimations of his de&s;ign, &s;ent &s;ecretary Herbert to require his appearance before the council, which was a&s;|&s;embled at the lord keeper's. While E&s;&s;ex was deliberating upon the manner he &s;hould
<PB N="146" REF="148">
proceed, whether to attend the &s;ummons, or fly into open rebellion, he received a private note, by which he was warned to provide for his own &s;afety. He now, therefore, con&s;ulted with his friends touching the emergency of their &s;ituation; they were de&s;titute of arms and ammunition, while the guards at the palace were doubled, &s;o that any attack upon that would be fruitle&s;s. While he and his confi|dants were in con&s;ultation, a per&s;on, probably employed by his enemies, came in as a me&s;&s;en|ger from the citizens, with tenders of friend|&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t all his adver&s;aries. Wild as the project was of rai&s;ing the city, in the pre&s;ent terrible conjuncture it was re&s;olved on, but the execution of it was delayed till the day following.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the next day, he was attended by his friends, the earls of Rut|land and Southampton, the lords Sandes, Parker, and Mounteagle, with three hundred per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The doors of E&s;&s;ex|hou&s;e were immediately locked, to prevent all &s;trangers from entering; and the earl now di&s;covered his &s;cheme for rai&s;ing the city more fully to all the con&s;pirators. In the mean time, Sir Walter Raleigh &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, this officer had a
<PB N="147" REF="149">
conference with him in a boat on the Thames, and there di&s;covered all their proceedings. The queen being informed of the whole, &s;ent in the utmo&s;t ha&s;te Egerton, the lord keeper, Sir William Knollys, the controller, Popham, the lord chief ju&s;tice, and the earl of Worce&s;t|er, to E&s;&s;ex hou&s;e, to demand the cau&s;e of the&s;e unu&s;ual proceedings. It was &s;ome time before they received admittance through the wicket into the hou&s;e; and it was not without &s;ome degree of fury, that they ordered E&s;&s;ex and his adherents to lay down their arms. While they continued undaunted in the di&s;charge of their duty, and the multitude around them clamoured loudly for their pu|ni&s;hment, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who now &s;aw that all was to be hazarded, re&s;olved to leave them pri&s;oners in his hou&s;e, and to &s;ally forth to make an in&s;urrection in the city. But he had made a very wrong e&s;timate in expecting that popularity alone could aid him in time of danger; he i&s;&s;ued out with about two hundred followers, armed only with &s;words; and in his pa&s;&s;age to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord Cromwell. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets, he cried aloud, For the queen! for the queen! a plot is laid for my life! hoping to engage the populace to ri&s;e;
<PB N="148" REF="150">
but they had received orders from the mayor to keep within their hou&s;es; &s;o that he was not joined by a &s;ingle per&s;on. He then pro|ceeded to the hou&s;e of Smith, the &s;heriff, on who&s;e aid he greatly depended; but the crowd gathered round him rather to &s;atisfy their cu|rio&s;ity than to lend him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. E&s;&s;ex now perceived that he was quite undone; and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by the earl of Cumberland, and lord Burleigh, he began to think of retreating to his own hou&s;e, there to &s;ell his life as dearly as he could. But he was prevented in his aims even there; the &s;treets in his way were baricadoed, and guarded by the citizens, under the com|mand of Sir John Levi&s;on. In fighting his way through this ob&s;truction, Henry Tracy, a young gentleman, for whom he had a &s;ingu|lar affection, was killed, and Sir Chri&s;topher Blount wounded and taken. The earl, him|&s;elf, attended by a few of his followers, the re&s;t having privately retired, made towards the river; and, taking a boat, arrived once more at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, where he began to make preparations for his defence. But his ca&s;e was too de&s;perate for any remedy from valour; wherefore, after demanding in vain for ho&s;ta|ges, and conditions from his be&s;igers, he &s;ur|rendered
<PB N="149" REF="151">
at di&s;cretion, reque&s;ting only civil treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex and Southampton were immediately carried to the archbi&s;hop's palace at Lam|beth, from whence they were next day convey|ed to the Tower, and tried by their peers on the nineteenth of February following. Little could be urged in their defence; their guilt was too flagrant, and though it de&s;erved pity it could not meet an acquittal. E&s;&s;ex after condemnation was vi&s;ited by that religious horror which &s;eemed to attend him in all his di&s;graces. He was terrified almo&s;t to de&s;pair by the gho&s;tly remon&s;trances of his own chap|lain, he was reconciled to his enemies, and made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his con&s;piracy. It is alledged upon this occa&s;ion, that he had &s;trong hopes of pardon, from the irre&s;olution which the queen &s;eemed to di&s;cover before &s;he &s;igned the warrant for his execution. She had given him formerly a ring, which &s;he de|&s;ired him to &s;end her in any emergency of this nature, and that it &s;hould procure his &s;afety and protection. This ring was actually &s;ent her by the counte&s;s of Nottingham, who, being a concealed enemy to the unfortunate earl, never delivered it; while Elizabeth &s;ecretly fired at his ob&s;tinacy in making no applica|tions for mercy and forgivene&s;s. The fact is,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
&s;he appeared her&s;elf as much an object of pity, as the unfortunate nobleman &s;he was induced to condemn. She &s;igned the warrant for his execution, &s;he countermanded it, &s;he again re&s;olved on his death, and again felt a new re|turn of tenderne&s;s. At la&s;t &s;he gave her con|&s;ent to his execution, and was never &s;een to enjoy one happy day more.</P>
<P>After the beheading of E&s;&s;ex, which death he &s;uffered in the thirty-fifth year of his age, &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates were brought in like manner to their trials. Cuffe, his &s;ecretary, a turbulent man, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great learning, Davers, Blount, Meric, and Davis, were con|demned and executed; the queen pardoned the re&s;t, being per&s;uaded that they were cul|pable only from their friend&s;hip to their bene|factor.</P>
<P>The remaining events of this reign are not con&s;iderable enough to come into a picture, already crouded with great ones. With the death of her favourite E&s;&s;ex, all Elizabeth's plea&s;ures &s;eemed to expire; &s;he afterwards went through the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate merely from habit, but her &s;atisfactions were no more. She had fallen into a profound melancho|ly, which all the advantages of her high for|tune, all the glories of her pro&s;perous reign,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
were unable to remove. She had now found out the fal&s;ehood of the counte&s;s of Notting|ham; who, on her death-bed, &s;ent for the queen, and informed her of the fatal circum&s;tance of the ring, which &s;he had neglected to deliver. This information only &s;erved to awaken all that pa&s;&s;ion which the queen had vainly en|deavoured to &s;uppre&s;s. She &s;hook the dying counte&s;s in her bed, crying out, <Q REND="inline">"That God might pardon her, but &s;he never would."</Q> She then broke from her, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to the dictates of her fixed de&s;pair. She refu&s;ed food and &s;u&s;tenance; &s;he continued &s;ilent, and gloomy; &s;ighs, and groans, were the only vent &s;he gave to her de&s;pondence; and &s;he lay for ten days and nights upon the carpet, leaning on cu&s;hions, which her maids brought her. Per|haps the faculties of her mind were impaired by long and violent exerci&s;e; perhaps &s;he re|flected with remor&s;e on &s;ome pa&s;t actions of her life, or perceived, but too &s;trongly, the decays of nature, and the approach of her di&s;&s;olution. She &s;aw her courtiers remitting their a&s;&s;iduity to her, in order to pay their court to James, the apparent &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Such a concurrence of cau&s;es was more than &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the remains of her con&s;titution; and her end was now vi&s;ibly &s;een to approach. Feeling a

perpetual heat in her &s;tomach, attended with an unquenchable thir&s;t, &s;he drank without cea&s;e|ing, but refu&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her phy&s;icians. Her di&s;temper gaining ground, Cecil, and the lord admiral, de&s;ired to know her &s;entiments with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. To this &s;he re|plied, that as the crown of England had al|ways been held by kings, it ought not to de|volve upon any inferior character, but upon her immediate heir the king of Scotland. Be|ing then advi&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury to fix her thoughts upon God, &s;he re|plied, that her thoughts did not in the lea&s;t wander from him. Her voice &s;oon after left her; &s;he fell into a lethargic &s;lumber, which continued &s;ome hours, and &s;he expired gently without a groan, in the &s;eventieth year of her age, and the forty-fifth of her reign. Her character differed with her circum&s;tances; in the beginning, &s;he was moderate and humble; towards the end of her reign, haughty, and &s;evere. But ever prudent, active, and di&s;cern|ing, &s;he procured for her &s;ubjects that happi|ne&s;s, which was not entirely felt by tho&s;e about her. She was indebted to her good for|tune, that her mini&s;ters were excellent; but it was owing to her indi&s;cretion that the favou|rites, who were more immediately cho&s;en by
<PB N="153" REF="155">
her&s;elf, were unworthy. Though &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellent &s;en&s;e, yet &s;he never had the di&s;cernment to di&s;cover that &s;he wanted beauty; and to flatter her charms at the age of &s;ixty-five, was the &s;ure&s;t road to her favour and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>But whatever were her per&s;onal defects as a queen, &s;he is to be ever remembered by the Engli&s;h with gratitude. It is true, indeed, that &s;he carried her prerogative in parliament to its highe&s;t pitch; &s;o that it was tacitly al|lowed in that a&s;&s;embly, that &s;he was above all law, and could make and unmake them at her plea&s;ure; yet &s;till &s;he was &s;o wi&s;e and good, as &s;eldom to exert that power which &s;he claim|ed, and to enforce few acts of her prerogative, which were not for the benefit of the people. It is true, in like manner, that the Engli&s;h during her reign were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no new, or &s;plendid acqui&s;itions; but commerce was daily growing up among them, and the peo|ple began to find that the theatre of their true&s;t conque&s;ts was to be on the bo&s;om of the ocean. A nation which hitherto had been the object of every inva&s;ion, and a prey to every plunderer, now a&s;&s;erted its &s;trength in turn, and became terrible to its invaders. The &s;ucce&s;sful voy|ages of the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, be|gan
<PB N="154" REF="156">
to excite their emulation; and they fitted out &s;everal expeditions for di&s;covering a &s;hort|er pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from government, colonized New England, while internal commerce was making equal improve|ments; and many Flemings, per&s;ecuted in their native country, found, together with their arts and indu&s;try, an ea&s;y a&s;ylum in England. Thus the whole i&s;land &s;eemed as if rouzed from her long habits of barbarity; arts, com|merce, and legi&s;lation began to acquire new &s;trength every day; and &s;uch was the &s;tate of learning at that time, that &s;ome fix that period as the Augu&s;tan age of England. Sir Walter Raleigh, and Hooker, are con&s;idered as among the fir&s;t improvers of our language. Spen&s;er and Shake&s;peare are too well known, as poets, to be prai&s;ed here; but of all mankind, Fran|cis Bacon, lord Verulam, who flouri&s;hed in this reign, de&s;erves, as a philo&s;opher, the highe&s;t applau&s;e; his &s;tyle is copious and correct, and his wit is only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his learning and penetration. If we look through hi&s;tory, and con&s;ider the ri&s;e of kingdoms, we &s;hall &s;carce find an in&s;tance of a people, becoming, in &s;o &s;hort a time, wi&s;e, powerful, and happy.

knew her own power, and &s;tretched it to the very verge of de&s;poti&s;m; but now that commerce was introduced, liberty &s;oon after fol|lowed; for there never was a nation perfectly commercial, that &s;ubmitted long to &s;lavery.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXVIII. JAMES I.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES, the &s;ixth of Scotland and the fir&s;t of England, the &s;on of Mary, came to the throne with the univer&s;al approbation of all orders of the &s;tate, as in his per&s;on were unit|ed every claim, that either de&s;cent, beque&s;t, or parliamentary &s;anction could confer. He had every rea&s;on, therefore, to hope for an happy reign; and he was taught, from
<PB N="157" REF="159">
his inafncy, that his prerogative was uncon|troulable, and his right tran&s;mitted from hea|ven. The&s;e &s;entiments he took no care to con|ceal; and he even publi&s;hed them in many parts of tho&s;e works, which he had written be|fore he left Scotland.</P>
<P>But he was greatly mi&s;taken in the &s;pirit of thinking of the times; for new &s;y&s;tems of go|vernment, and new ideas of liberty, had for &s;ome time been &s;tealing in with the reforma|tion; and only wanted the reign of a weak or merciful monarch, to appear without controul. In con&s;equence of the progre&s;s of knowledge, and a familiar acquaintance with the governments of antiquity, the old Gothic forms began to be de&s;pi&s;ed; and an emula|tion took place, to imitate the freedom of Greece and Rome. The &s;evere, though popu|lar government of Elizabeth, had confined this ri&s;ing &s;pirit within very narrow bounds; but when a new &s;overeign, and a new family ap|peared, le&s;s dreaded, and le&s;s loved by the people, &s;ymptoms immediately began to be &s;een of a more free and independent genius in the nation.</P>
<P>James &s;carce was entered into England when he gave di&s;gu&s;t to many. The de&s;ire in all to &s;ee their new &s;overeign was ardent and na|tural;
<PB N="158" REF="160">
but the king, who loved retirement, forbid the concour&s;e that attended on his jour|ney from Scotland, pretending that this great re&s;ort of people would produce a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. To this offence to the people he added, &s;oon after, what gave offence to the higher orders of the &s;tate, by pro&s;tituting titles of honour, &s;o that they became &s;o common as to be no longer marks of di&s;tinction. A pa&s;|quinade was fixed up at St. Paul's, declaring that there would be a lecture given on the art of a&s;&s;i&s;ting &s;hort memories, to retain the names of the new nobility.</P>
<P>But though his countrymen &s;hared a part of the&s;e honours, yet ju&s;tice mu&s;t be done the king, by confe&s;&s;ing, that he left almo&s;t all the great offices in the hands he found them. Among the&s;e, Cecil, created earl of Sali&s;bury, who had been &s;o active in the la&s;t reign again&s;t his own intere&s;ts, was continued now prime mini&s;ter and chief coun&s;ellor. This crafty &s;tate&s;man had been too cunning for the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates; and while, during Elizabeth's reign, he was apparently leagued again&s;t the earl of E&s;&s;ex whom James protected, yet he kept up a &s;ecret corro&s;pondence with that mo|narch, and &s;ecured his intere&s;ts without for|feiting the confidence of his party.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">But it was not &s;o fortunate with lord Grey, lord Cobham, and Sir Walter Raleigh, who had been Cecil's a&s;&s;ociates. They felt imme|diately the effects of the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their employments. The&s;e three &s;eemed to be marked out for peculiar indig|nation, for &s;oon after they were accu&s;ed of en|tering into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the king; nei|ther the proofs of which, nor its aims, have reached po&s;terity: all that is certain is, that they were condemned to die, but had their &s;entence mitigated by the king. Cobham and Grey were pardoned, after they had laid their heads on the block. Raleigh was reprieved, but remained in confinement many years after|wards, and at la&s;t &s;uffered for this offence, which was never proved.</P>
<P>This mercy, &s;hewn to the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed delin|quents, was very plea&s;ing to the people; and the king, willing to remove all jealou&s;y of his being a &s;tranger, began his attempts in parlia|ment by an endeavour to unite both king|doms into one. However, the people were not as yet ripe for this coalition; they were ap|prehen&s;ive that the po&s;ts and employments, which were in the gift of the court, would be conferred on the Scotch, whom they were as yet taught to regard as foreigners. By the
<PB N="160" REF="162">
repul&s;e in this in&s;tance, as well as by &s;ome ex|ceptions, the hou&s;e of commons took to the form of his &s;ummons to parliament, James found that the people he came to govern, were very different from tho&s;e he had left behind; and perceived that he mu&s;t give rea&s;ons for every mea&s;ure he intended to enforce.</P>
<P>He now, therefore, attempted to correct his former mi&s;take, and to peru&s;e the Engli&s;h laws, as he had formerly done tho&s;e of his own country, and by the&s;e he re&s;olved to govern. But even here he again found him&s;elf di&s;ap|pointed. In a government &s;o fluctuating as that of England, opinion was ever deviating from law; and what was enacted in one reign, was contradicted by cu&s;tom in another. The laws had all along declared in favour of an al|mo&s;t unlimited prerogative, while the opi|nions of the people were guided by in&s;tructors, who began to teach oppo&s;ite principles. All the kings and queens before him, except &s;uch as were controuled by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, or awed by foreign inva&s;ion, i&s;&s;ued rather their commands to parliament, than gave their rea|&s;ons. James, unmindful of this alteration in the opinions of the people, re&s;olved to govern in the ancient manner; while the people, on the contrary, having once got an idea of the
<PB N="161" REF="163">
inherent privileges of mankind, never gave it up, &s;en&s;ible that they had rea&s;on and power al&s;o on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s, therefore, were the di&s;putes between the king and his parliament during his whole reign; one attempting too keep the privileges of the crown entire, the other aiming at abridging the dangerous part of the preroga|tive; the one labouring to pre&s;erve cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;hed for time immemorial, the other equally a&s;&s;iduous in defending the inherent privileges of humanity. Thus we &s;ee laud|able motives actuating the di&s;putants on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and the principles of both founded either in law or in rea&s;on. When the parliament would not grant a &s;ub&s;idy, James had examples enough among his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, which taught him to extort a bene|volence. Edward the fourth, Henry the eighth, and queen Elizabeth her&s;elf, had often done &s;o; and precedent undoubtedly entitled him to the &s;ame privilege. On the other hand, the hou&s;e of commons, who found their growing power to protect the people, and not &s;uffer the impo&s;itions of the crown, con&s;idered that this extorted benevolence might at length render the &s;overeign entirely independent of the parliament, and therefore
<PB N="162" REF="164">
complained again&s;t it as an infringement of their privileges. The&s;e attempts of the crown, and the&s;e murmurings of the commons, con|tinued through this whole reign, and fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to that &s;pirit of party, which has ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in England; the one for pre&s;erving the ancient con&s;titution, by main|taining the prerogative of the king; the other for trying an experiment to improve it, by extending the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>During the&s;e conte&s;ts, James, who &s;up|po&s;ed no arguments &s;ufficient to impair the prerogative, &s;eemed entirely &s;ecure that none would attempt to alledge any. He daily continued to entertain his parliament with &s;et &s;peeches, and florid harrangues, in which he urged his divine right and ab&s;olute power as things inconte&s;tible; to the&s;e the commons made as regular an&s;wers, not ab&s;o|lutely denying his preten&s;ions, but &s;lowly and regularly abridging his power.</P>
<P>However, tho' James per&s;evered in a&s;&s;erting his prerogative, and threatened tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to abridge it, yet his ju&s;tice and clem|ency were very apparent in the toleration which he gave to the teachers of different religions throughout the kingdom. The minds of the people had long been irritated
<PB N="163" REF="165">
again&s;t one another, and each party per&s;ecuted the re&s;t, as it happened to prevail; it was ex|pected, therefore, that James would &s;treng|then the hands of that which was then upper|mo&s;t; and that the catholics and &s;ectaries &s;hould find no protection. But this monarch wi&s;ely ob&s;erved, that men &s;hould be puni&s;hed for actions, and not for opinions; a deci&s;ion which gave general di&s;&s;atisfaction: but the univer&s;al complaint of every &s;ect was the be&s;t argument of his moderation towards all.</P>
<P>Yet mild as this monarch was, there was a project contrived in the very beginning of his reign for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery, which, were it not a fact known to all the world, could &s;carcely be credited by po&s;terity. This was the gun-powder plot, than which a more hor|rid or terrible &s;cheme never entered into the human heart to conceive, and which &s;hews at once the mo&s;t determined courage may be united with the mo&s;t execrable intentions.</P>
<P>The Roman catholics had expected great favour and indulgence on the acce&s;&s;ion of James, both as a de&s;cendant from Mary, a rigid catholic, and al&s;o as having &s;hewn &s;ome partiality to that religion in his youth. But they &s;oon di&s;covered their mi&s;take; and were at once &s;urpri&s;ed and enraged to find James
<PB N="164" REF="166">
on all occa&s;ions expre&s;s his re&s;olution of &s;trict|ly executing the laws enacted again&s;t them, and of per&s;evering in the conduct of his predece&s;&s;or. This declaration determined them upon more de&s;perate mea&s;ures; and they at length formed a re&s;olution of de&s;troy|ing the king and both hou&s;es of parliament at a blow. The &s;cheme was fir&s;t broached by Robert Cate&s;by, a gentleman of good parts and ancient family, who conceived that a train of gun-powder might be &s;o placed under the parliament-hou&s;e, as to blow up the king and all the members at once. He opened his intention to Thomas Percy, a de&s;cendant from the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Northumberland, who was charmed with the project, and readily came into it. Thomas Winter was next en|tru&s;ted with the dreadful &s;ecret; and he went over to Flanders in que&s;t of Guy Fawkes, an officer in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, with who&s;e zeal and courage the con&s;pirators were thoroughly acquainted. When they enli&s;ted any new zealot into their plot, the more firmly to bind him to &s;ecrecy, they always, together with an oath, employed the &s;acrament, the mo&s;t &s;acred rite of religion. Every tender feeling and all pity were bani&s;hed from their brea&s;ts; and Te&s;mond and Garnet, two je&s;uits, &s;uperiors
<PB N="165" REF="167">
of the order, ab&s;olved their con&s;ciences from every &s;cruple.</P>
<P>How horrid &s;oever the contrivance might appear, yet every member &s;eemed faithful and &s;ecret in the league; and about two months before the &s;itting of parliament, they hired an hou&s;e, in Percy's name, adjoining to that in which the parliament was to a&s;&s;emble. Their fir&s;t intention was to bore a way under the parliament-hou&s;e, from that which they occu|pied, and they &s;et them&s;elves laboriou&s;ly to the ta&s;k; but when they had pierced the wall, which was three yards in thickne&s;s, on ap|proaching the other &s;ide, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the hou&s;e was vaulted underneath, and that a magazine of coals were u&s;ually depo&s;ited there. From their di&s;appointment on this account they were &s;oon relieved, by information that the coals were then &s;elling off, and that the vaults would be then let to the highe&s;t bidder. They therefore &s;eized the opportunity of hiring the place, and bought the remaining quantity of coals with which it was then &s;tored, as if for their own u&s;e. The next thing done was to convey thither thirty-&s;ix barrels of gun-powder, which had been purcha&s;ed in Holland; and the whole was covered with the coals and with faggots
<PB N="166" REF="168">
brought for that purpo&s;e. Then the doors of the cellar were boldly flung open, and every body admitted, as if it contained nothing dangerous.</P>
<P>Confident of &s;ucce&s;s, they now began to plan the remaining part of their project. The king, the queen, and prince Henry, the king's elde&s;t &s;on, were all expected to be pre&s;ent at the opening of the parliament. The king's &s;econd &s;on, by rea&s;on of his tender age, would be ab&s;ent, and it was re&s;olved that Percy &s;hould &s;eize, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The prin|ce&s;s Elizabeth, a child likewi&s;e, was kept at lord Harrington's hou&s;e in Warwick&s;hire; and Sir Everard Digby was to &s;eize her, and immediately proclaim her queen.</P>
<P>The day for the &s;itting of parliament now approached. Never was trea&s;on more &s;ecret, or ruin more apparently inevitable; the hour was expected with impatience, and the con&s;pi|rators gloried in their meditated guilt. The dreaful &s;ecret, though communicated to above twenty per&s;ons, had been religiou&s;ly kept during the &s;pace of near a year and an half; when all the motives of pity, ju&s;tice, and &s;afety, were too weak, a remor&s;e of private friend&s;hip &s;aved the kingdom.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Percy, one of the con&s;pirators,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
conceived a de&s;ign of &s;aving the life of lord Mounteagle, his intimate friend and compa|nion, who al&s;o was of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion with him&s;elf. About ten days before the meeting of parliament, this nobleman, upon his return to town, received a letter from a per&s;on unknown, and delivered by one who fled as &s;oon as he had di&s;charged his me&s;&s;age. The letter was to this effect,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lord, &s;tay away from this parliament; for God and man have concurred to puni&s;h the wicked|ne&s;s of the times. And think not &s;lightly of this adverti&s;ement, but retire your&s;elf in|to your country, where you may expect the event in &s;afety. For though there be no appearance of any &s;tir, yet I &s;ay they will receive a terrible blow this parliament; and yet they &s;hall not &s;ee who hurts them. This coun&s;el is not to be contemned, be|cau&s;e it may do you good, and can do you no harm. For the danger is pa&s;t as &s;oon as you have burned the letter."</Q></P>
<P>The contents of this my&s;terious letter &s;ur|pri&s;ed and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed; and though inclined to think it a fooli&s;h attempt to affright and ridicule him, yet he judged it &s;afe&s;t to carry it to lord Sali&s;bury, &s;ecetary of &s;tate. Lord Sali&s;bury
<PB N="168" REF="170">
too was inclined to give little attention to it, yet thought proper to lay it before the king in council, who came to town a few days after. None of the council were able to make any thing of it, although it appeared &s;erious and alarming. In this univer&s;al agitation be|tween doubt and apprehen&s;ion, the king was the fir&s;t who penetrated the meaning of this dark epi&s;tle. He concluded that &s;ome &s;udden danger was preparing by gun-powder; and it was thought advi&s;eable to in&s;pect all the vaults below the hou&s;es of parliament. This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, lord cham|berlain, who purpo&s;ely delayed the &s;earch, till the day before the meeting of parliament.<MILESTONE N="Nov. 5, 1605."> He remarked tho&s;e great piles of faggots which lay in the vault under the hou&s;e of peers; and he ca&s;t his eye upon Fawkes, who &s;tood in a dark corner, and who pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for Percy's &s;ervant. That daring determined courage, which he had long been noted for, even among the de&s;perate, was fully painted in his countenance, and &s;truck the lord chamberlain with &s;trong &s;u&s;picion. The great quantity of fuel al&s;o kept there for the u&s;es of a per&s;on &s;eldom in town, did not pa&s;s unnoticed; and he re&s;olved to take his time to make a more exact &s;crutiny. About mid|night,
<PB N="169" REF="171">
therefore, Sir Thomas Knevit, a ju&s;tice of peace, was &s;ent with proper attendants, and, ju&s;t at the entrance of the vault, he &s;eized a man preparing for the terrible enterprize, dre&s;&s;ed in a cloak and boots, and a dark lan|thorn in his hand. This was no other than Guy Fawkes, who had ju&s;t di&s;po&s;ed every part of the train for its taking fire the next morning, the matches and other combu&s;tibles being found in his pockets. The whole of the de&s;ign was now di&s;covered; but the atro|ciou&s;ne&s;s of his guilt, and the de&s;pair of par|don, in&s;piring him with re&s;olution, he told the officers of ju&s;tice, with an undaunted air, that had he blown them and him&s;elf up together he had been happy. Before the council he di&s;played the &s;ame intrepid firmne&s;s, mixt even with &s;corn and di&s;dain, refu&s;ing to di&s;co|ver his a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;hewing no concern but for the failure of his enterprize. But his bold &s;pirit was at length &s;ubdued; being confined to the Tower for two or three days, and the rack ju&s;t &s;hewn him, his courage, fatigued with &s;o long an effort, at la&s;t failed him, and he made a full di&s;covery of all his accomplices.</P>
<P>Cate&s;by, Percy, and the con&s;pirators who were in London, hearing that Fawkes was
<PB N="170" REF="172">
arre&s;ted, fled with all &s;peed to Warwick&s;hire, where Sir Everard Digby, relying on the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the plot, was already in arms, in order to &s;eize the prince&s;s Elizabeth. But the country &s;oon began to take the alarm, and wherever they turned, they found a &s;uperior force ready to oppo&s;e them. In this exigence, be&s;et on all &s;ides, they re&s;olved, to about the number of eighty per&s;ons, to fly no farther, but make a &s;tand at an hou&s;e in Warwick&s;hire, to defend it to the la&s;t, and &s;ell their lives as dearly as po&s;&s;ible. But even this mi&s;erable con&s;olation was denied them: a &s;park of fire happening to fall among &s;ome gun-powder that was laid to dry, it blew up, and &s;o maimed the principal con&s;pirators, that the &s;urvivors re&s;olved to open the gate, and &s;ally out a|gain&s;t the multitude that &s;urrounded the hou&s;e. Some were in&s;tantly cut to pieces; Cate&s;by, Percy, and Winter, &s;tanding back to back, fought long and de&s;perately, till in the end the two fir&s;t fell covered with wounds, and Winter was taken alive. Tho&s;e that &s;urvived the &s;laughter were tried and con|victed; &s;everal fell by the hands of the execu|tioner, and others experienced the king's mer|cy. The je&s;uits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the plot, &s;uffered with the re&s;t;

and, notwith&s;tanding the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of their trea&s;on, Garnet was con&s;idered by his party as a martyr, and miracles were &s;aid to have been wrought by his blood.</P>
<P>Such was the end of a con&s;piracy that brought ruin on its contrivers, and utterly &s;upplanted that religion it was intended to e&s;tabli&s;h. Yet it is remarkable, that before this audacious attempt, the con&s;pirators had always borne a fair reputation; Cate&s;by was loved by all his acquaintance, and Digby was as highly re&s;pected both for his honour and integrity as any man in the nation. However, &s;uch are the lengths that &s;uper&s;tition and early prejudice can drive minds originally well form|ed, but impre&s;&s;ed by a wrong direction.</P>
<P>The king's moderation, after the extinction of this con&s;piracy, was as great as his penetra|tion in the prevention of it. The hatred ex|cited in the nation again&s;t the catholics knew no bounds; and nothing but a total extinction of tho&s;e who adhered to that per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;eem|ed capable of &s;atisfying the greater part of the people. James bravely rejected all violent mea&s;ures, and nobly declared, that the late con&s;piracy, however atrocious, &s;hould never alter his plans of government; but as, on the one hand, he was determined to puni&s;h guilt,
<PB N="172" REF="174">
&s;o, on the other, he would &s;till &s;upport and protect innocence.</P>
<P>This moderation, however laudable, was at that time no way plea&s;ing to the people, and the malignant part of his &s;ubjects were willing to a&s;cribe his lenity to the papi&s;ts, to his being him&s;elf tinctured with their &s;uper&s;titions. However this be, he &s;till found his parliaments refractory to all the mea&s;ures he took to &s;up|port his authority at home, or his de&s;ire of peace with foreign &s;tates. His &s;peeches in|deed betrayed no want of re&s;olution to defend his rights; but his liberality to his favourites, and the in&s;ufficiency of his finances to maintain the royal dignity, &s;till rendered him dependent upon his parliament for money, and they took care to keep him in indigence. Thus he was often forced into conce&s;&s;ions, which, when once granted, could never be recalled; and while he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf maintaining the royal prerogative, it was dimini&s;hing on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>It was, perhaps, the oppo&s;ition which James met with from his people, that made him place his affections upon different per&s;ons about the court, whom he rewarded with a liberality that bordered on profu&s;ion. The
<PB N="173" REF="175">
death of young prince Henry, his elde&s;t &s;on, which happened at this time,<MILESTONE N="1612" UNIT="A.D."> a youth of great hopes, gave him no very great unea&s;ine&s;s, as his affections were rather taken up by newer con|nexions. In the fir&s;t rank of the&s;e &s;tood Robert Carre, a youth of a good family in Scotland, who, after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in his travels, arrived in London, at about twenty years of age. All his natural accom|pli&s;hments con&s;i&s;ted in a plea&s;ing vi&s;age; all his acquired abilities, in an ea&s;y and graceful demeanor. This youth came to England with letters of recommendation to &s;ee his countryman, lord Hay; and that nobleman took an opportunity of a&s;&s;igning him the of|fice of pre&s;enting the king his buckler at a match of tilting. When Carre was advancing to execute his office, he was thrown by his hor&s;e, and his leg was broke in the king's pre&s;ence. James approached him with pity and concern, and ordered him to be lodged in the palace till his cure was completed. He him&s;elf, after tilting, paid him a vi&s;it in his chamber, and returned frequently during his confinement. The ignorance and &s;implicity of the youth confirmed the king's affections, as he di&s;regarded learning in his favourites, of which he found but very little u&s;e in his own
<PB N="174" REF="176">
practice. Carre was therefore &s;oon con&s;idered as the mo&s;t ri&s;ing man at court; he was knighted, created vi&s;count Roche&s;ter, honour|ed with the order of the garter, made a privy-coun&s;ellor; and, to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t pitch of honour, he was at la&s;t created earl of Somer&s;et.</P>
<P>This was an advancement which &s;ome re|garded with envy; but the wi&s;er part of man|kind looked upon it with contempt and ridi|cule, &s;en&s;ible that ungrounded attachments are &s;eldom of long continuance. Nor was it long before the favourite gave proofs of his being unworthy the place he held in the king's affections. Among the friends whom he con|&s;ulted at court was Sir Thomas Overbury, a man of great abilities and learning; among the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es whom he addre&s;&s;ed was the young counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, who&s;e hu&s;band had been &s;ent by the king's command to travel, until the young couple &s;hould be arrived at the age of puberty. But the a&s;&s;iduities of a man of &s;uch per&s;onal ac|compli&s;hments as the favourite were too pow|erful to be re&s;i&s;ted; a criminal core&s;pondence was commenced between the counte&s;s and the earl; and E&s;&s;ex, upon his return from his travels, found his wife beautiful and lovely indeed, but her affections entirely placed upon
<PB N="175" REF="177">
another. But this was not all; not contented with denying him all the rights of an hu&s;band, &s;he was re&s;olved to procure a divorce, and then to marry the favourite, to whom &s;he had granted her heart. It was upon this occa&s;ion that Overbury was con&s;ulted by his friend; and that this hone&s;t coun&s;ellor declared him|&s;elf utterly aver&s;e to the match. He de&s;crib|ed the counte&s;s as an infamous and abandon|ed woman; and went &s;o far as to threaten the earl that he would &s;eparate him&s;elf from him for ever, if he could &s;o far forget his honour and his intere&s;t as to pro&s;ecute the intended marriage. The con&s;equence of this advice was fatal to the giver. The counte&s;s, being made acquainted with his expo&s;tulations, urged her lover to undo him. In con&s;equence of this command, the king was per&s;uaded by the favourite to order Overbury on an emba&s;&s;y into Ru&s;&s;ia; Overbury was per&s;uaded by the &s;ame advi&s;er to refu&s;e going; the delin|quent was &s;hut up in the Tower, and there he was poi&s;oned, by the direction of the coun|te&s;s, in a tart.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the divorce which had been with &s;ome difficulty procured, took place, and the marriage of the favourite was &s;olemnized with all imaginable &s;plendour. But the
<PB N="176" REF="178">
&s;u&s;picion of Overbury's being poi&s;oned every day grew &s;tronger, and reached the favourite, amid&s;t all the glare and &s;plendor of &s;eeming happine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s. The graces of his youth gradually di&s;appeared; the gaiety of his manners were converted into &s;ullen &s;ilence; and the king, who&s;e affections had been en|gaged by the&s;e &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments, began to cool to a man who no longer con|tributed to his amu&s;ement. But the adoption of another favourite, and the di&s;covery of Somer&s;et's guilt, &s;oon removed all remains of affection, which the king might &s;till harbour for him.</P>
<P>An apothecary's apprentice, who had been employed in making up the poi&s;on, having retired to Flu&s;hing, had divulged the &s;ecret there; and the affair being thus laid before the king, he commanded Sir Edward Coke, lord chief ju&s;tice, to &s;ift the affair to the bottom, with rigorous impartiality. This injunction was exe|cuted with great indu&s;try and &s;everity; and the whole complication of their guilt was careful|ly unravelled. The lieutenant of the Tower, with &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er criminals, were con|demned and executed; Somer&s;et and his counte&s;s were &s;oon after found guilty, but reprieved, and pardoned after &s;ome years of
<PB N="177" REF="179">
&s;trict confinement. The king's duplicity and inju&s;tice on this occa&s;ion are urged as very great &s;tains upon his character. Somer&s;et was in his pre&s;ence at the time the officer of ju&s;tice came to apprehend him; and boldly reprehended that mini&s;ter's pre&s;umption for daring to arre&s;t a peer of the realm before the king. But James being informed of the cau&s;e, &s;aid, with a &s;mile,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nay, nay, you mu&s;t go; for if Coke &s;hould &s;end for my|&s;elf, I mu&s;t comply."</Q>
He then embraced him at parting, begged he would return im|mediately, and a&s;&s;ured him he could not live without his company: yet he had no &s;ooner turned his back, than he exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go, and the devil go with thee, I &s;hall never &s;ee thy face again."</Q>
He was al&s;o heard to wi&s;h, &s;ome time after, that God's cur&s;e might fall upon him and his family, if he &s;hould pardon tho&s;e whom the law &s;hould condemn; however, he afterwards re&s;tored them both to liberty, and granted them a pen&s;ion, with which they retired, and langui&s;h|ed out the remainder of their lives in guilt, infamy, and mutual recrimination.</P>
<P>But the king had not been &s;o improvident as to part with one favourite until he had provided him&s;elf with another. This was
<PB N="178" REF="180">
George Villiers, a youth of one and twenty, a younger brother of a good family, who was re|turned about that time from his travels, and whom the enemies of Somer&s;et had taken occa&s;ion to throw in the king's way, certain that his beau|ty and fa&s;hionable manners would do the re&s;t. Accordingly, he had been placed at a comedy full in the king's view, and immediately caught the monarch's affections. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e times, which appears not without &s;ome degree of malignity again&s;t this monarch, does not however in&s;inuate any thing flagitious in the&s;e connexions, but imputes his attach|ment rather to a weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding, than to any perver&s;ion of appetite. Villiers was immediately taken into the king's &s;ervice, and the office of cup-bearer was be&s;towed upon him. It was in vain that Somer&s;et had u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to depre&s;s him; his &s;tern jealou|&s;y only &s;erved the more to intere&s;t the king in the young man's behalf.</P>
<P>But after Somer&s;et's fall, the favour of James was wholly turned upon young Vil|liers; in the cour&s;e of a few years he created him vi&s;count Villiers, earl, marquis, and duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, chief ju&s;tice in Eyre, warden of the cinque ports, ma&s;ter of the king's bench
<PB N="179" REF="181">
office, &s;teward of We&s;tmin&s;ter, con&s;table of Wind&s;or, and lord high admiral of England. His mother obtained the title of counte&s;s of Buckingham; his brother was created vi&s;count Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy re|lations were all pu&s;hed up into credit and au|thority. It may, indeed be reckoned among the mo&s;t capricious circum&s;tances of this mo|narch's reign, that he, who was bred a &s;cholar, &s;hould chu&s;e for his favourites the mo&s;t illiter|ate per&s;ons about his court; that he, who&s;e per&s;onal courage was greatly &s;u&s;pected, &s;hould lavi&s;h his honours upon tho&s;e who&s;e only ac|compli&s;hments were a &s;kill in the warlike exer|ci&s;es of the times.</P>
<P>When unworthy favourites were thus ad|vanced, it is not to be wondered at if the pub|lic concerns of the kingdom were neglected, and men of real merit left to contempt and mi|&s;ery. Yet &s;uch was the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, with regard to the cautionary towns in Holland, and the brave Sir Walter Raleigh at home.</P>
<P>In the preceding reign, Elizabeth, when &s;he gave a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Dutch, at that time &s;hak|ing off the Spani&s;h yoke, was not &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted upon her lending them large &s;ums of money, as not to require a proper depo&s;it for being repaid. The Dutch, therefore, put
<PB N="180" REF="182">
into her hands the three important fortre&s;&s;es of Flu&s;hing, Brille, and Ramekins, which were to be re&s;tored upon payment of the money due, which amounted in the whole to above eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. But James, in his pre&s;ent exigence, being to &s;upply a needy favourite and a craving court, agreed to evacuate the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es, upon being paid a third part of the money that was &s;trictly due. The cautionary towns, therefore, were eva|cuated, which had held the &s;tates in total &s;ub|jection; and which an ambitious or enterprize|ing prince would have regarded as his mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al murmur which this impolitic mea&s;ure produced, was &s;oon after heightened by an act of &s;everity, which &s;till continues as the blacke&s;t &s;tain upon this monarch's me|mory. The brave and learned Raleigh had been confined in the Tower almo&s;t from the very beginning of James's acce&s;&s;ion, for a con|&s;piracy which had never been proved again&s;t him; and in that abode of wretchedne&s;s he wrote &s;everal valuable performances, which are &s;till in the highe&s;t e&s;teem. His long &s;ufferings, and his ingenious writings, had now turned the tide of popular opinion in his favour; and they who once dete&s;ted the enemy of E&s;&s;ex,
<PB N="181" REF="183">
could not now help pitying the long captivity of this philo&s;ophical &s;oldier. He him&s;elf &s;till &s;truggled for freedom; and perhaps it was with this de&s;ire that he &s;pread the report of his having di&s;covered a gold mine in Guiana, which was &s;ufficient to enrich, not only the ad|venturers who &s;hould &s;eize it, but afford im|men&s;e trea&s;ures to the nation. The king, ei|ther believing his a&s;&s;ertions, or willing to &s;ub|ject him to further di&s;grace, granted him a commi&s;&s;ion to try his fortune in que&s;t of the&s;e golden &s;chemes; but &s;till re&s;erved his former &s;entence as a check upon his future behaviour.</P>
<P>Raleigh was not long in making prepara|tions for this adventure, which, from the &s;an|guine manner in which he carried it on, many believe he thought to be as promi&s;ing as he de&s;cribed it. He bent his cour&s;e to Guiana, and remaining him&s;elf at the mouth of the river Oroonoko, with five of the large&s;t &s;hips, he &s;ent the re&s;t up the &s;tream, under the com|mand of his &s;on and of captain Keymis, a per|&s;on entirely devoted to his intere&s;ts. But in&s;tead of a country abounding in gold, as the adven|turers were taught to expect, they found the Spaniards had been warned of their approach, and were prepared in arms to receive them.
<PB N="182" REF="184">
Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out that <Q REND="inline">"This was the true mine,"</Q> meaning the town of St. Thomas, which he was ap|proaching; <Q REND="inline">"and that none but fools looked for any other:"</Q> but ju&s;t as he was &s;peaking, he received a &s;hot, of which he immediately ex|pired. This was followed by another di&s;ap|pointment, for when the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the town they found nothing in it of any value.</P>
<P>It was Keymis who pretended that he had &s;een the mine, and gave the fir&s;t account of it to Raleigh; but he now began to retract, and though he was within two hours march of the place, he refu&s;ed, on the mo&s;t ab&s;urd pre|tences, to take any effectual &s;tep towards find|ing it. He returned, therefore, to Raleigh with the melancholy news of his &s;on's death; and then going into his cabbin, put an end to his own life in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Raleigh, in this forlorn &s;ituation, found now that all his hopes were over; but &s;aw his mis|fortunes &s;till farther aggravated by the re|proaches of tho&s;e whom he had undertaken to command. Nothing could be more deplorable than his &s;ituation, particularly when he was told that he mu&s;t be carried back to England to an&s;wer for his conduct to the king. It is pretended
<PB N="183" REF="185">
that he employed many artifices, fir&s;t to engage them to attack the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements at a time of peace; and failing of that, to make his e&s;cape into France. But all the&s;e proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, he was delivered into the king's hands, and &s;trictly examined, as well as his fellow adventurers, before the privy-council. Count Gondemar, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, made heavy complaints again&s;t the expedition; and the king declared that Raleigh had ex|pre&s;s orders to avoid all di&s;putes and ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t the Spaniards. Wherefore, to give the court of Spain a particular in&s;tance of his attachment, he &s;igned the warrant for his execution, not for the pre&s;ent offence, but for his former con&s;piracy. Thus &s;hew|ing him&s;elf guilty of complicated inju&s;tice; unju&s;t in originally having condemned him without proof; unju&s;t in having tru&s;ted a man with a commi&s;&s;ion without a pardon, expre&s;&s;ive of that confidence; unju&s;t in puni&s;hing with death a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion that did not de&s;erve it; but mo&s;t unju&s;t of all, when he refu&s;ed a new trial, but condemned him upon an ob&s;olete &s;entence. This great man died with the &s;ame fortitude that he had te&s;tified through life; he ob&s;erved, as he felt the edge of the ax, that it was a &s;harp, but a &s;ure remedy for all evils;
<PB N="184" REF="186">
his harangue to the people was calm and elo|quent; and he laid his head down on the block with the utmo&s;t indifference. His death en|&s;ured him that popularity, which his former intrepidity and his &s;ufferings, &s;o much greater than his crimes, had tended to procure him; and no mea&s;ure, in this reign, was attended with &s;o much public di&s;&s;atisfaction. The death of this great man was &s;oon after followed by the di&s;grace of a &s;till greater, namely, the chan|cellor Bacon, who was accu&s;ed of receiving bribes in his office; and, pleading guilty, was degraded and fined thirty thou&s;and pounds; but his fine was afterwards remitted by the king.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1618" UNIT="A.D."> But there &s;oon appeared very apparent rea|&s;ons for James's partiality to the court of Spain, in the ca&s;e of Raleigh. This monarch had entertained an opinion which was peculiar to him&s;elf, that in marrying his &s;on Charles, the prince of Wales, any alliance below that of royalty would be unworthy of him; he, there|fore, was obliged to &s;eek, either in the court of France or Spain, a &s;uitable match, and he was taught to think of the latter. Gonde|mar, who was amba&s;&s;ador from that court, perceiving this weak monarch's partiality to a crowned head, made an offer of the &s;econd
<PB N="185" REF="187">
daughter of Spain to prince Charles; and that he might render the temptation irre&s;i&s;tible, he gave hopes of an immen&s;e fortune which &s;hould attend the prince&s;s. However this was a negotiation that was not likely &s;oon to be concluded; and from the time the idea was fir&s;t &s;tarted, James &s;aw five years elap&s;ed with|out bringing the treaty to any kind of conclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>A delay of this kind was very di&s;plea&s;ing to the king, who had all along an eye on the great fortune of the prince&s;s; nor was it le&s;s di&s;agreeable to prince Charles, who, bred up with ideas of romantic pa&s;&s;ion, was in love without ever &s;eeing the object of his affections. In this general tedium of delay, a project en|tered the head of Villiers, who had for &s;ome years ruled the king with ab&s;olute authority, that was fitter to be conceived by the knight of a romance, than by a mini&s;ter and a &s;tate&s;|man. It was nothing le&s;s, than that the prince &s;hould him&s;elf travel in di&s;gui&s;e into Spain, and vi&s;it the object of his affections in per&s;on. Buckingham, who wanted to ingratiate him|&s;elf with the prince, offered to be his compa|nion; and the king, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to check &s;o wild a &s;cheme, gave his con&s;ent to this hopeful propo&s;al. Their adventures on this
<PB N="186" REF="188">
project could fill novels; and have actually been made the &s;ubject of many. Charles was the knight-errant, and Buckingham was his '&s;quire. They travelled through France in di&s;gui&s;e, a&s;&s;uming the names of Jack and Tom Smith. They went to a ball at Paris, where the prince fir&s;t &s;aw the prince&s;s Henrietta, whom he afterwards married, and who was then in the bloom of youth and beauty. They were received at the court of Spain with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations of re&s;pect; but Buck|ingham filled the whole city with intrigues, adventures, &s;erenades, challenges, and jealou|&s;y. To complete the catalogue of his follies, he fell in love with the dutche&s;s of Olivarez, the prime mini&s;ter's wife, and in&s;ulted that mini&s;ter in per&s;on. The&s;e levities were not to be endured at &s;uch a court as that of Spain, where jealou&s;y is &s;o prevalent, and decorum &s;o much ob&s;erved; the match therefore broke off, for what rea&s;on hi&s;torians do not a&s;&s;ign; but if we may credit the noveli&s;ts of that time, the prince had already fixed his affections upon the French prince&s;s.</P>
<P>In fact, a match for this prince was &s;oon after negotiated with Henrietta, who was the daughter of the great Henry the fourth; and this met with much better &s;ucce&s;s than the
<PB N="187" REF="189">
former. However, the king had not the &s;ame allurements in pro&s;ecuting this match as the former, as the portion promi&s;ed him was much &s;maller; but willing that his &s;on &s;hould not be altogether di&s;appointed of a bride, as the king of France demanded only the &s;ame terms which had been offered to the court of Spain, James con&s;ented to comply. In an article of this treaty of marriage it was &s;tipulated, that the education of the children, till the age of thirteen, &s;hould belong to the mother; and this probably gave that turn towards popery, which has &s;ince been the ruin of that unfortu|nate family.</P>
<P>Indeed a variety of cau&s;es &s;eemed to con|&s;pire, together with their own imprudence, to bring down upon them tho&s;e evils which they afterwards experienced. The hou&s;e of com|mons was by this time become quite unma|nageable; the prodigality of James to his fa|vourites, had made his nece&s;&s;ities &s;o many, that he was contented to &s;ell the different branches of his prerogative to the commons, one after the other, to procure &s;upplies. In proportion as they perceived his wants, they found out new grievances; and every grant of money was &s;ure to come with a petition for redre&s;s. The &s;truggles between him and his
<PB N="188" REF="190">
parliament had been growing more and more violent every &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the very la&s;t ad|vanced their preten&s;ions to &s;uch a degree, that he began to take the alarm; but the&s;e evils fell upon the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, which the weak|ne&s;s of this monarch had contributed to give birth to.</P>
<P>The&s;e dome&s;tic troubles were attended by others &s;till more important in Germany, and which produced in the end the mo&s;t dangerous effects. The king's elde&s;t daughter had been married to Frederic, the elector Palatine of Germany, and this prince revolting again&s;t the emperor Ferdinand the &s;econd, was defeated in a deci&s;ive battle, and obliged to take re|fuge in Holland. His affinity to the Engli&s;h crown, his misfortunes, but particularly the prote&s;tant religion, for which he had contend|ed, were &s;trong motives for the people of England to wi&s;h well to his cau&s;e; and fre|quent addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent from the commons to &s;pur up James to take a part in the Ger|man conte&s;t, and to replace the exiled prince upon the throne of his ance&s;tors.<MILESTONE N="1620" UNIT="A.D."> James at fir&s;t attempted to ward off the misfortunes of his &s;on-in-law by negotiations; but the&s;e prov|ing utterly ineffectual, it was re&s;olved at la&s;t to re&s;cue the Palatinate from the emperor by
<PB N="189" REF="191">
force of arms. Accordingly war was declared again&s;t Spain and the emperor; &s;ix thou&s;and men were &s;ent over into Holland, to a&s;&s;i&s;t prince Maurice in his &s;chemes again&s;t tho&s;e powers; the people were every where elated at the courage of their king, and were &s;atisfied with any war which was to exterminate the papi&s;ts. This army was followed by another con&s;i&s;ting of twelve thou&s;and men, commanded by count Mansfeldt, and the court of France promi&s;ed its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the Engli&s;h were di&s;ap|pointed in all their views: the troops being embarked at Dover, upon &s;ailing to Calais, they found no orders for their admi&s;&s;ion. After waiting in vain for &s;ome time, they were obliged to &s;ail towards Zealand, where no pro|per mea&s;ures were yet con&s;ulted for their di&s;|embarkation. Mean while, a pe&s;tilential di&s;|temper crept in among the forces, &s;o long cooped up in narrow ve&s;&s;els; half the army died while on board, and the other half, weakened by &s;ickne&s;s, appeared too &s;mall a body to march into the Palatinate; and thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitle&s;s expedi|tion.</P>
<P>Whether this misfortune had any effect upon the con&s;titution of the king is uncertain; but he was &s;oon after &s;eized with a tertian ague,<MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D.">
<PB N="190" REF="192">
which, when his courtiers a&s;&s;ured him from the proverb that it was health for a king, he replied, that the proverb was meant for a young king. After &s;ome fits he found him&s;elf ex|tremely weakened, and &s;ent for the prince, whom he exhorted to per&s;evere in the pro|te&s;tant religion; then preparing with decency and courage to meet his end, he expired, af|ter a reign over England of twenty-two years, and in the fifty-ninth year of his age. With regard to foreign negotiations, James neither under&s;tood nor cultivated them; and perhaps in a kingdom &s;o &s;ituated as England, dome&s;tic politics are alone &s;ufficient. His reign was marked with none of the &s;plendors of triumph, nor no new conque&s;ts or acqui|&s;itions; but the arts were neverthele&s;s &s;ilently and &s;ucce&s;sfully going on to improvement. Rea&s;on was extending her influence, and di&s;co|vering to mankind a thou&s;and errors in reli|gion, in morals, and in government, that had long been reverenced by blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The reformation had produced a &s;pirit of liberty, as well as of inve&s;tigation, among all ranks of mankind, and taught them that no precedents could &s;anctify fraud, tyranny, or inju&s;tice. James taught them by his own example to argue upon the nature of the king's prerogative, and the ex|tent

of the &s;ubjects liberty. He fir&s;t began by &s;etting up the pre&s;criptive authority of kings again&s;t the natural privileges of the people; but when the &s;ubject was &s;ubmitted to a con|trover&s;y, it was &s;oon &s;een that the monarch's was the weake&s;t &s;ide.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D."> FEW princes have a&s;cended a throne with more apparent advantages than Charles; and none ever encountered more real difficulties. The advantages were &s;uch as might flatter even the mo&s;t cautious prince into &s;ecurity; the difficulties were &s;uch as no abilities could &s;urmount. He found him&s;elf, upon coming to the crown, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a peaceful and flou|ri&s;hing
<PB N="193" REF="195">
kingdom; his right undi&s;puted by all the world, his power &s;trengthened by an alli|ance with one of the mo&s;t potent nations in Europe, his ab&s;olute authority tacitly acknow|ledged by one part of his &s;ubjects, and en|forced from the pulpit by the re&s;t. To add to all this he was loved by his people, who&s;e hearts he had gained by his virtues, his humi|lity, and his candour.</P>
<P>But on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the picture we are pre&s;ented with a very different &s;cene. Men had begun to think on the different rights of mankind; and found, that all had an equal claim to the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of freedom. The &s;pirit of liberty was rou&s;ed; and it was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the ancient claims of mo|narchs, who u&s;urped their power in times of ignorance or danger, and who pleaded in &s;uc|ceeding times their former depredations as pre&s;criptive privileges. Charles had been taught from his infancy to con&s;ider the royal preroga|tive as a &s;acred pledge, which it was not in his power to alienate, much le&s;s his duty to a|bridge. His father, who had contributed &s;o much to &s;ink the claims of the crown, had neverthele&s;s boldly defended them in his writ|ings, and taught his &s;on to defend by the &s;word what he had only inculcated by the
<PB N="194" REF="196">
pre&s;s. Charles, though a prince of tolerable under&s;tanding, had not comprehen&s;ion enough to &s;ee, that the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of his people had received a total change; he re|&s;olved, therefore, to govern by old maxims and precedents, a people who had lately found out that the&s;e maxims were e&s;tabli&s;hed in times of ignorance and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>In the foregoing reigns I have given very little of the parliamentary hi&s;tory of the times, which would have led me out of the way; but in the pre&s;ent it will be fit to point out the tran&s;actions of every parliament, as they make the principal figure in this remarkable aera, in which we &s;ee genius and courage united in op|po&s;ing inju&s;tice, &s;econded by cu&s;tom, and backed by power.</P>
<P>Charles undertook the reins of government with a fixed per&s;ua&s;ion that his popularity was &s;ufficient to carry every mea&s;ure. He had been loaded with a treaty for defending the Palati|nate in the late reign; and the war declared for that purpo&s;e was to be carried on with vi|gour in this. But war was more ea&s;ily de|clared than &s;upplies granted. After &s;ome re|luctance the commons voted him two &s;ub&s;i|dies; a &s;um far from being &s;ufficient to &s;up|port him in his intended equipment, to a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="195" REF="197">
his brother-in-law; and to this was added a petition for puni&s;hing papi&s;ts, and redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of the nation. Buckingham, who had been the late king's favourite, and who was &s;till more care&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ent mo|narch, did not e&s;cape their cen&s;ures; &s;o that in&s;tead of granting the &s;ums requi&s;ite, they employed the time in di&s;putations and com|plaints, till the &s;ea&s;on for pro&s;ecuting the in|tended campaign was elap&s;ed. Charles, there|fore, wearied with their delays, and offended at their refu&s;al of his demands,<MILESTONE N="1625" UNIT="A.D."> thought pro|per to di&s;&s;olve a parliament which he could not bring to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the want of parliamentary aids, Charles had recour&s;e to &s;ome of the ancient methods of extortion, practi&s;ed by &s;overeigns when in nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances. That kind of tax called a benevolence was ordered to be exacted, and privy-&s;eals were i&s;&s;ued accord|ingly. In order to cover the rigour of this &s;tep, it was commanded, that none &s;hould be a&s;ked for money but &s;uch as were able to &s;pare it; and he directed letters to different per&s;ons, mentioning the &s;ums he de&s;ired. With this the people were obliged, though reluctantly, to comply; it was in fact authori&s;ed by many precedents; but no precedents what&s;oever could give a &s;anction to inju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198">With this money a fleet was equipped a|gain&s;t Spain, carrying ten thou&s;and men, the command of which army was entru&s;ted to lord Wimbleton, who &s;ailed directly to Ca|diz, and found the bay full of &s;hips of great value. But he failed in making him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the harbour, while his undi&s;ciplined army landing, in&s;tead of attacking the town, could not be re&s;trained from indulging them|&s;elves in the wine, which they found in great abundance on &s;hore. Further &s;tay, therefore, appearing fruitle&s;s, they were re-imbarked; and the plague attacking the fleet &s;oon after|wards, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and return to England. Loud complaints were made again&s;t the court, for entru&s;ting &s;o important a command to a per&s;on who was judged &s;o unqualified for the under|taking.</P>
<P>This ineffectual expedition was a great blow to the court; and to retrieve the glory of the nation, another attempt was to be made, but with a more certain pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. New &s;upplies therefore being requi&s;ite, the king was re&s;olved to obtain them in a more regular and con&s;titutional manner than before. Another parliament was accordingly called; and tho' &s;ome &s;teps were taken to exclude the more po|pular
<PB N="197" REF="199">
leaders of the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons, by nominating them as &s;heriffs of counties, yet the pre&s;ent parliament &s;eemed more refractory than the former. When the king laid before the hou&s;e his nece&s;&s;ities, and a&s;ked for a &s;upply, they voted him only three &s;ub&s;idies, which a|mounted to about an hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds; a &s;um no way adequate to the importance of the war, or the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate. But even this was not to be grant|ed, until the grievances of the &s;tate were re|dre&s;&s;ed. Their chief indignation was levelled again&s;t Buckingham, a mini&s;ter who had no real merit, and the great infelicity of being the king's favourite. Whenever the &s;ubjects re&s;olve to attack the royal prerogative, they begin with the favourites of the crown, and wi&s;e monarchs &s;eldom have any. Charles was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the art of making a di&s;tinc|tion between friends and mini&s;ters; and who|ever was his friend was always tru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of his affairs. He loved Buck|ingham, and undertook to protect him, al|though to defend a per&s;on &s;o obnoxious to the people, was to &s;hare his reproach. The com|mons undertook to impeach him in the lower hou&s;e, while the earl of Bri&s;tol, who had re|turned from his emba&s;&s;y in Spain, accu&s;ed him
<PB N="198" REF="200">
among his peers. The purport of the charge again&s;t him amounted to little more than that he had engro&s;&s;ed too much power for him&s;elf and his relations; that he had neglected to guard the &s;eas with the fleet; and that he had applied a pla&s;ter to the late king's &s;ide, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be poi&s;onous, and to ha&s;ten his end. The&s;e frivolous accu&s;ations mu&s;t have &s;unk of them&s;elves, had they not been intemperately oppo&s;ed by the royal authority. The king gave orders to the lord-keeper to command the commons expre&s;sly in his name not to meddle with his mini&s;ter and &s;ervant Buckingham. The more to enrage them, he had him elected chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and wrote that body a letter of thanks for their compliance. He a&s;&s;ured the commons, that if they would not comply with his demands, he would try <HI>new councils.</HI> But what ju&s;tly enraged them beyond all &s;ufferance was when two of their members, Sir Dudley Digges and Sir John Elliot, complaining of this partiality in favour of a man odious to the nation, the king ordered both to be com|mitted to pri&s;on for &s;editious behaviour. This was an open act of violence, and &s;hould have been &s;upported, or never attempted.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">It was now that the commons ju&s;tly ex|claimed that their privileges were infringed, and all freedom of debate de&s;troyed. They prote&s;ted, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that neither of their members had &s;aid any thing di&s;re&s;pectful of the king, and they made pre|parations for publi&s;hing their vindication. The king, who&s;e character it was to &s;hew a readi|ne&s;s to undertake har&s;h mea&s;ures, but not to &s;upport them, relea&s;ed the two members; and this compliance confirmed that ob&s;tinacy in the hou&s;e, which his injuries had contributed to give ri&s;e to. The earl of Arundel, for being guilty of the &s;ame offence in the hou&s;e of lords, was ra&s;hly impri&s;oned, and as tamely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the king. Thus the two hou&s;es having refu&s;ed to an&s;wer the intentions of the court without previous conditions, the king, rather than give up his favourite, cho&s;e to be without the &s;upply, and therefore once more di&s;&s;olved the parliament.</P>
<P>The new councils which Charles had men|tioned to the parliament, were now to be tried, in order to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities. In&s;tead of making peace with Spain, and thus trying to abridge his expences, &s;ince he could not enlarge his income, he re&s;olved to carry on the war, and to keep up a &s;tanding army for this purpo&s;e.
<PB N="200" REF="202">
Perhaps al&s;o he had further views in keeping this army in pay, which was to &s;eize upon the liberty of his &s;ubjects, when he found matters ripe for the execution. But at pre&s;ent his forces were new levied, ill paid, and wor&s;e di&s;|ciplined; &s;o that the militia of the country, that would be in&s;tantly led out again&s;t him, were far his &s;uperiors. In order, therefore, to gain time and money, a commi&s;&s;ion was openly granted to compound with the catholics, and agree for a di&s;pen&s;ation of the penal laws a|gain&s;t them. He borrowed a &s;um of money from the nobility, who&s;e contributions came in but &s;lowly. But the greate&s;t &s;tretch of his power was in the levying of <HI>&s;hip-money.</HI> In order to equip a fleet (at lea&s;t this was the pretence made) each of the maritime towns was required, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the adja|cent counties, to arm as many ve&s;&s;els as were appointed them. The city of London was rated at twenty &s;hips. This was the com|mencement of a tax, which afterwards, being carried to &s;uch violent lengths, created &s;uch great di&s;contents in the nation. But the ex|tortions of the mini&s;try did not re&s;t here. Per&s;ons of birth and rank, who refu&s;ed the loan, were &s;ummoned before the council; and, upon per&s;i&s;ting in a refu&s;al, were put into con|finement.
<PB N="201" REF="203">
Thus we &s;ee here, as in every ci|vil war, &s;omething to blame on one &s;ide and the other. Both &s;ides guilty of inju&s;tice, yet either in general actuated by motives of vir|tue. The one contending for the inherent liberties of mankind, the other for the pre|&s;criptive privileges of the crown; both driven to all the extremes of fal&s;ehood, rapine, and inju&s;tice; and, by a fate attendant on huma|nity, permitting their actions to degenerate from the motives which fir&s;t &s;et them in motion.</P>
<P>Hitherto the will of the monarch was re|luctantly obeyed; mo&s;t of tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to lend their money, were thrown into pri&s;on, and patiently &s;ubmitted to confinement, or applied by petition to the king for their re|lea&s;e. Five per&s;ons alone undertook to de|fend the cau&s;e of the public; and, at the ha|zard of their whole fortunes, were re&s;olved to try whether the king legally had a right to confine their per&s;ons without an infringement of any law. The names of the&s;e patriots were Sir Thomas Darnel, Sir John Corbet, Sir Wal|ter Earl, Sir John Haveningham, and Sir Ed|ward Hambden. Their cau&s;e was brought to a &s;olemn trial before the King's Bench, and the whole kingdom was attentive to the re&s;ult of &s;o important a trial.<MILESTONE N="Nov. 1626."></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">By the debates on this &s;ubject it appeared, that per&s;onal liberty had been &s;ecured by no le&s;s than &s;ix different &s;tatutes, and by an arti|cle of the Great Charter it&s;elf. That in times of turbulence and &s;edition, the princes infring|ed upon tho&s;e laws; and of this al&s;o many ex|amples were produced. The difficulty then lay to determine when &s;uch violent mea&s;ures were expedient; but of that the court pre|tended to be the &s;upreme judge. As it was legal, therefore, that the&s;e five gentlemen &s;hould plead the &s;tatute, by which they might demand bail, &s;o it was expedient in the court to remand them to pri&s;on, without determin|ing on the nece&s;&s;ity of taking bail for the pre|&s;ent. This was a cruel eva&s;ion of ju&s;tice; and, in fact, &s;atisfied neither the court nor the country party. The court in&s;i&s;ted that no bail could be taken; the country exclaimed, that the pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;et free.</P>
<P>The king being thus embroiled with his parliament, his people, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful foreign &s;tates, it was not without amazement that all men &s;aw him enter into a war with France, a kingdom with which he had but lately formed the mo&s;t natural al|liance. This monarch, among the foibles of a good di&s;po&s;ition, relied too much on the
<PB N="203" REF="205">
&s;incerity of his &s;ervants; and, among others, permitted Buckingham to lead him as he thought proper. All hi&s;torians agree that this mini&s;ter had conceived hopes of gaining the heart of the queen of France, while, at the &s;ame time, Cardinal Richelieu a&s;pired to the &s;ame honour. The rivalry of the&s;e favourites produced an inveterate enmity between them; and from a private quarrel, they re&s;olved to involve their re&s;pective nations in the di&s;pute. However this be, war was declared again&s;t France; and Charles was taught to hope, that ho&s;tilities with that kingdom would be the &s;ure&s;t means of producing unanimity at home.</P>
<P>But fortune &s;eemed to counteract all this monarch's attempts. A fleet was &s;ent out, under the command of Buckingham, to re|lieve Rochelle, a maritime town in France, that had long enjoyed its privileges indepen|dent of the French king; but that had for &s;ome years embraced the reformed religion, and now was be&s;ieged with a formidable army. This expedition was as unfortunate as that to the coa&s;ts of Spain. The duke's mea&s;ures were &s;o ill concerted, that the inhabitants of the city &s;hut their gates, and refu&s;ed to admit allies, of who&s;e coming they were not pre|viou&s;ly informed. In&s;tead of attacking the
<PB N="204" REF="206">
i&s;land of Oleron, which was fertile and de|fencele&s;s, he bent his cour&s;e to the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;, which was garri&s;oned, and well fortified. He attempted there to &s;tarve out the garri&s;on of St Martin's ca&s;tle, which was copiou&s;ly &s;up|plied with provi&s;ions by &s;ea. By that time the French had landed their forces privately at another part of the i&s;land; &s;o that Bucking|ham was at la&s;t obliged to retreat, but with &s;uch precipitation, that two thirds of his ar|my were cut in pieces before he could reim|bark, though he was the la&s;t man of the whole army that quitted the &s;hore. This proof of his per&s;onal courage, however, was but a &s;mall &s;ubject of con&s;olation for the di&s;|grace which his country had &s;u&s;tained, and his own per&s;on would have been the la&s;t they would have regretted.</P>
<P>The bad &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition &s;erved to render the duke &s;till more obnoxious, and the king more needy. He therefore re&s;olved to call a third parliament; for money was to be had at any rate. In his fir&s;t &s;peech, he told them they were convoked on purpo&s;e to grant the &s;upplies; and that if they &s;hould neglect to contribute what was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the &s;tate, he would, in di&s;charge of his con&s;cience, u&s;e tho&s;e means that God
<PB N="205" REF="207">
had put into his hands, for &s;aving that, which the folly of certain per&s;ons would otherwi&s;e endanger. But the king did not find his commons intimidated by his threats, nor by tho&s;e of the lord-keeper, who commented upon what he &s;aid. They boldly inveighed again&s;t his late arbitrary mea&s;ures, forced loans, benevolences, taxes without con&s;ent of parliament, arbitrary impri&s;onments, bilet|ting &s;oldiers, martial laws; the&s;e were the grievances complained of, and again&s;t the&s;e they in&s;i&s;ted that an eternal remedy &s;hould be provided. An immunity from the&s;e vexations they alledged to be the inherent right of the &s;ub|ject; and their new demand they re&s;olved to call a petition of right, as implying privileges they had already been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.<MILESTONE N="1628" UNIT="A.D."> Nothing could be more ju&s;t than the enacting the contents of this petition of right into a law. The Great Charter, and the old &s;tatutes, were &s;ufficiently clear in favour of liberty; but as all the kings of England had ever, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity or expediency, been accu&s;tomed at intervals to elude them; and as Charles, in a complication of in&s;tances, had lately violated them, it was but requi&s;ite to enact a new law, which might not be eluded or violated by any authority, or any former precedent to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208">But though this was an equitable propo&s;al, and though the ready compliance with it might have prevented many of the di&s;orders that were about to en&s;ue, Charles was taught to con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t violent encroachment on his prerogative, and u&s;ed at fir&s;t every me|thod to obruct its progre&s;s. When he found that nothing but his a&s;&s;ent would &s;atisfy the hou&s;e, he gave it; but at fir&s;t in &s;uch an am|biguous manner as left him &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former power. At length, however, to avoid their indignation, and &s;till more to &s;creen his favourite Buckingham, he thought proper to give them full &s;atisfaction. He came therefore to the hou&s;e of peers, and pro|nouncing the u&s;ual form of words
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Soit come il e de&s;ire; Let it be law as it is de&s;ired,"</Q>
he gave the petition of right all the &s;anction that was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s it into a law. The ac|clamations with which the hou&s;e re&s;ounded &s;ufficiently te&s;tified the joy of the people; and a bill for five &s;ub&s;idies, which pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon af|ter, was the &s;tronge&s;t mark of their gratitude.</P>
<P>But the commons finding their per&s;everance crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in this in&s;tance, were re&s;olved to carry their &s;crutiny into every part of government, which they con&s;idered as de|fective. The leaders of the hou&s;e of commons
<PB N="207" REF="209">
at this time were very different from tho&s;e il|literate barbarians which a century or two before came up to the capital, not to grant &s;upplies, but to con&s;ider where &s;upplies were to be procured; not to debate as legi&s;lators, but to receive commands as inferiors. The men of whom the pre&s;ent parliaments were compo&s;|ed, were per&s;ons of great knowlege and ex|ten&s;ive learning; of undaunted courage, and inflexible per&s;everance.</P>
<P>A little before the meeting of this parlia|ment, a commi&s;&s;ion had been granted to thirty-three of the principal officers of &s;tate, empowering them to meet, and concert among them&s;elves the methods of levying money by impo&s;itions, or otherwi&s;e. The commons applied for cancelling that commi&s;&s;ion; and indeed the late &s;tatute of the petition of rights &s;eemed to render &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion entirely unnece&s;&s;ary. They objected to another com|mi&s;&s;ion for rai&s;ing money for the introduction of a thou&s;and German hor&s;e, which, with ju&s;t rea&s;on, they feared might be turned again&s;t the liberties of the people. They re&s;umed al&s;o their cen&s;ure of Buckingham, whom they re&s;olved implacably to pur&s;ue. They al&s;o openly a&s;&s;erted, that a method of levying mo|ney u&s;ed by the king called tonnage and pound|age,
<PB N="208" REF="210">
without the con&s;ent of parliament, was a palpable violation of all the liberties of the people. All the&s;e grievances were preparing to be drawn up in a remon&s;trance to his ma|je&s;ty, when the king, hearing of their inten|tions, came &s;uddenly to the hou&s;e, and ended the &s;e&s;&s;ion by a prorogation.</P>
<P>But they were not &s;o ea&s;ily to be intimidated in their &s;chemes for the liberty of the people. They urged their claims with &s;till more force on their next &s;itting; and the duty of tonnage and poundage was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with greater pre|ci&s;ion than before. This tax upon merchan|di&s;e was a duty of very early in&s;titution, and had been conferred on Henry the fifth, and all &s;ucceeding princes during life, in order to enable them to maintain a naval force for the protection of the kingdom. But the parlia|ment had u&s;ually granted it as of their &s;pecial favour in the beginning of each reign, except to Henry the eighth, who had it not conferred on him by parliament, till the &s;ixth year of his &s;itting on the throne. Although he had continued to receive it from the beginning, yet he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have the &s;anction of parliament to en&s;ure it to him, which cer|tainly implied that it was not an inherent pri|vilege of the crown. Upon this argument,
<PB N="209" REF="211">
the commons founded their objections to the levying it in the pre&s;ent reign; it was a tax they had not yet granted, and it had been granted by them in every preceding reign. They refu&s;ed, therefore, to grant it now; and in&s;i&s;ted the king could not levy it without their permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This bred a long conte&s;t, as may be &s;up|po&s;ed, between the commons and the crown. The officers of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e were &s;um|moned before the commons, to give an ac|count by what authority they &s;eized the goods of the merchants, who had refu&s;ed to pay the&s;e duties. The barons of the Exchequer were que&s;tioned concerning their decrees on that head; the &s;heriff of London was committed to the Tower for his activity in &s;upporting the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers. The&s;e were bold mea&s;ures; but the commons went &s;till farther, by a re&s;olution to examine into religious griev|ances, and a new &s;pirit of intolerance began to appear. The king, therefore,<MILESTONE N="1629" UNIT="A.D."> re&s;olved to di&s;&s;olve a parliament, which he found him&s;elf unable to manage; and Sir John Finch, the &s;peaker, ju&s;t as the que&s;tion concerning ton|nage and poundage was going to be put, ro&s;e up, and informed the hou&s;e that he had a command from the king to adjourn.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">Nothing could exceed the con&s;ternation and indignation of the commons upon this information. Ju&s;t at a time they were carry|ing their mo&s;t favourite points to a bearing, to be thus adjourned, and the parliament di&s;|&s;olved, rendered them furious. The hou&s;e was in an uproar; the &s;peaker was pu&s;hed back into his chair, and forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a &s;hort remon&s;trance was framed, and pa&s;&s;ed by acclamation rather than vote. In this ha&s;ty production, Papi&s;ts and Arminians were declared capital enemies to the &s;tate. Tonnage and poundage was condemned as contrary to law; and not only tho&s;e who rai&s;ed that duty, but tho&s;e who paid it, were con&s;idered as guilty of capital crimes.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this violent procedure, Sir Miles Hobart, Sir Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, and Strode, were, by the king's order, committed to pri&s;on, under pre|tence of &s;edition. But the &s;ame temerity that impelled Charles to impri&s;on them, induced him to grant them a relea&s;e. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were &s;ummoned before the King's Bench; but they refu&s;ing to appear before an inferior tribunal, for faults com|mitted in a &s;uperior, they were condemned to be impri&s;oned during the king's plea&s;ure, to
<PB N="211" REF="213">
pay a fine, the two former of a thou&s;and pounds each, and the latter of five hundred, and to find &s;ureties for their good behaviour. The members triumphed in their &s;ufferings, while they had the whole kingdom as &s;pectators and applauders of their fortitude.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the king was thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the ob&s;tinacy of the commons, he felt a much &s;everer blow in the death of his favourite, the duke of Buckingham, who fell a &s;acrifice to his unpopularity. It had been re&s;olved once more to undertake the rai&s;|ing of the &s;iege of Rochelle; and the earl of Denbigh, brother-in-law to Buckingham, was &s;ent thither, but returned without effecting any thing. In order to repair this di&s;grace, the duke of Buckingham went in per&s;on to Port&s;|mouth to hurry on another expedition, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had endeavoured to defraud the crown of the legal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. In the general di&s;content that prevailed again&s;t this nobleman, it was daily expected that &s;ome &s;e|vere mea&s;ures would be re&s;olved on; and he was &s;tigmatized as the tyrant and the betrayer of his country. There was one Felton, who caught the general contagion; an Iri&s;hman of a good family, who had &s;erved under the duke as lieutenant, but had re&s;igned, on being
<PB N="212" REF="214">
refu&s;ed his rank on the death of his captain, who had been killed at the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;. This man was naturally melancholy, courageous, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic; he felt for his country, as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of his &s;ingle arm to remove. He therefore re&s;olved to kill the duke, and thus revenge his own private inju|ries, while he did &s;ervice al&s;o to God and man. Animated in this mannner with gloomy zeal, and mi&s;taken patrioti&s;m, he travelled down to Port&s;mouth alone, and entered the town while the duke was &s;urrounded by his levee, and giving out the nece&s;&s;ary orders for embarka|tion. He was at that time engaged in conver|&s;ation with one Soubize, and other French gen|tlemen; and a difference of &s;entiments having ari&s;en in the conference, it was attended with all the&s;e violent ge&s;ticulations with which foreigners generally enforce their meaning. The conver&s;ation being fini&s;hed, the duke drew towards the door; and while he was &s;peaking to one of his colonels, Felton &s;truck him over that officer's &s;houlder in the brea&s;t with his knife. The duke had only time to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The villain has killed me,"</Q> when he fell at the colonel's feet, and in&s;tantly expired. No one had &s;een the blow, nor the per&s;on

who gave it; but in the confu&s;ion it was ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed that he was murdered by one of the Frenchmen, who appeared &s;o violent in their motions but a little before. They were accordingly &s;ecured, as for certain puni&s;h|ment; but in the mean time an hat was picked up, on the in&s;ide of which was &s;ewed a paper, containing four or five lines of the remon|&s;trance of the commons again&s;t the duke; and under the&s;e lines a &s;hort ejaculation, de&s;iring aid in the attempt. It was now concluded that this hat mu&s;t belong to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and while they were employed in conjectures who&s;e it &s;hould be, a man without an hat was &s;een walking very compo&s;edly before the door, and was heard to cry out, I am he. He di&s;dained denying a murder in which he gloried; and averred, that he looked upon the duke as an enemy to his country, and as &s;uch de&s;erving to &s;uffer. When a&s;ked at who&s;e in&s;tigation he had performed that horrid deed? he an&s;wer|ed, that they need not trouble them&s;elves in that enquiry; that his con&s;cience was his only prompter, and that no man on earth could di&s;po&s;e him to act again&s;t its dictates. He &s;uffered with the &s;ame degree of con&s;tancy to the la&s;t; nor were there many wanting who admired not only his fortitude, but the action for which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216">The king had always the highe&s;t regard for Buckingham, and was extremely mortified at his death; he began to perceive that the tide of popularity was entirely turned from him, and that the hou&s;e of commons only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the general di&s;content. He felt therefore a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t parliaments; and he was re&s;olved not to call any more, till he &s;hould &s;ee greater indications of a compli|ant di&s;po&s;ition in the nation. Having lo&s;t his favourite Buckingham, he became more his own mini&s;ter, and never afterwards impo&s;|ed &s;uch unlimited confidence in any other. But though the mini&s;ter of the crown was changed, the mea&s;ures &s;till continued the &s;ame; the &s;ame di&s;regard to the petitions of the people, the &s;ame de&s;ire of extending and &s;upporting the prerogative, the &s;ame temerity, and the &s;ame weakne&s;s of conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t mea&s;ure, however, now being left without a mini&s;ter and a parliament, was a prudent one.<MILESTONE N="1629" UNIT="A.D."> He made peace with the two crowns, again&s;t whom he had hitherto waged war, which had been entered upon without nece&s;&s;ity, and conducted without glory. Be|ing freed from the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, he bent his whole attention to the management of the internal policy of the kingdom, and took two
<PB N="215" REF="217">
men as his a&s;&s;ociates in this ta&s;k, who &s;till acted an under-part to him&s;elf. The&s;e were Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards created earl of Strafford; and Laud, afterwards arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Strafford, by his eminent talents and abili|ties, merited all the confidence which the king repo&s;ed in him. His character was &s;tately and au&s;tere; more fitted to procure e&s;teem than love; his fidelity to the king was un&s;ha|ken; but in &s;erving the intere&s;ts of the crown, he did not con&s;ider him&s;elf as an agent al&s;o for benefit of the people. As he now em|ployed all his coun&s;els to &s;upport the preroga|tive, which he formerly had endeavoured to dimini&s;h, his actions are liable to the imputation of &s;elf-intere&s;t and ambition, but his good character in private life made up for that &s;eeming duplicity of public conduct.</P>
<P>Laud was in the church &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling Strafford in the &s;tate, rigid, &s;evere, punctual, and indu&s;trious. His zeal was un|relenting in the cau&s;e of religion, and the forms as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of queen Elizabeth &s;eemed e&s;&s;entially connected with it. His de&s;ire to keep the&s;e on their former footing was imprudent and &s;evere; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the furious oppo&s;ition he met with was &s;ufficient to excite his re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218">Since the times of Elizabeth, a new reli|gious &s;ect had been gaining ground in Eng|land; which, from the &s;uppo&s;ed greater purity of their manners, were called <HI>Puritans.</HI> Of all other &s;ects, this was the mo&s;t dangerous to monarchy; and the tenets of it more calcu|lated to &s;upport that imagined equality which obtains in a &s;tate of nature. The partizans of this religion, being generally men of warm, ob&s;tinate tempers, pu&s;hed their &s;entiments into a total oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of Rome; and in the countries where their opinions had taken place, not only a religious, but a political free|dom began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. All enthu&s;ia&s;ts, indulging them&s;elves in rapturous flights, ex|ta&s;ies, vi&s;ions, and in&s;pirations, have a natural aver&s;ion to all ceremonies, rites, or forms, which are but external means of &s;upplying that devotion, which they want no prompter but their hearts to in&s;pire. The &s;ame bold and daring &s;pirit which accompanied them in their addre&s;&s;es to the divinity, appeared in their political &s;peculations; and the princi|ples of civil liberty, which had hitherto been almo&s;t totally unknown in Europe, began to &s;hoot forth in this ungracious &s;oil. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if kings and bi&s;hops were willing to &s;uppre&s;s the growth of
<PB N="217" REF="219">
opinions &s;o unfavourable to their authority; and that Laud, who of all men alive, was the mo&s;t attached to ceremony and &s;hew, &s;hould treat with rigour, men who braved him into &s;everity. The truth is, that in the hi&s;tories of the times, we find the great cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between the king and his people to ari&s;e, not from civil, but religious motives; not from a de&s;ire on the one hand of extending power, and on the other of pro|moting liberty; but merely from the ardour of the king in &s;upporting bi&s;hops, &s;urplices, and other ceremonies of the church, and the fury of the puritans in aboli&s;hing tho&s;e di&s;tinc|tions, as remnants of popi&s;h idolatry. The&s;e di&s;tinctions in religion, at this day, are regard|ed with more unconcern; and, therefore, we are more apt to impute the di&s;orders of tho&s;e times, rather to civil motives of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing liberty, which, in reality, made but a very &s;ubordinate con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The humour of the nation ran, at that time, into the extreme oppo&s;ite of &s;uper&s;tition; and tho&s;e ancient ceremonies, to which men had been accu&s;tomed in England, &s;ince the com|mencement of the Reformation, were in general con&s;idered as impious and idolatrous. It was, therefore, the mo&s;t impolitic time in the world
<PB N="218" REF="220">
for Laud to think of introducing new ceremo|nies and ob&s;ervances, which could not fail of being treated with utter dete&s;tation. Never|thele&s;s he went on boldly with his injunctions for the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rites, which, in them|&s;elves, were of no moment; and, therefore, were as unnece&s;&s;ary to be urged by him, as ri|diculous in being oppo&s;ed by the puritans.</P>
<P>Orders were given, and rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on, that the communion table &s;hould be re|moved from the middle of the church, where it hitherto &s;tood &s;ince the Reformation, to the Ea&s;t end; where it &s;hould be railed in, and denominated the altar. The kneeling at the altar, and the u&s;ing of copes, an embroidered ve&s;tment u&s;ed in popi&s;h countries, were intro|duced to the great di&s;content of the people. Some pictures were admitted again into churches by his command. All &s;uch clergy as neglected to ob&s;erve every ceremony, were &s;u&s;pended, and deprived by the high commi&s;|&s;ion court. And, to mortify the puritans &s;till more, orders were i&s;&s;ued from the council, for|bidding any controver&s;y, either from the pul|pit or the pre&s;s, on the points in di&s;pute be|tween them and their opponents, concerning free will and prede&s;tination. At the &s;ame time that he obtained the king's protection for
<PB N="219" REF="221">
carrying on the&s;e mea&s;ures, he took care to repay the monarch, by magnifying on every occa&s;ion the regal authority; and treating all preten&s;ions to independence, as a puritanical innovation. The king's divine, hereditary, and indefea&s;ible right, was the theme of every &s;ermon; and tho&s;e who attempted to que&s;tion &s;uch doctrines, were con&s;idered as making an attack upon religion it&s;elf. The king, who had now taken a re&s;olution of calling no more parliaments, and which re&s;olution he adhered to for the &s;pace of eleven years after, was very well &s;atisfied with the&s;e doctrines; as they were the only means of facilitating his mea&s;ures of government, and procuring tho&s;e pecuniary &s;upplies which he had no legal means of ob|taining.</P>
<P>While Laud, therefore, during this long in|terval, ruled the church, the king and Straf|ford undertook to manage the temporal in|tere&s;ts of the nation. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, in which Charles declared,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas, for &s;everal ill ends, the calling again of a parliament is divulged; yet the late abu&s;es, having for the pre&s;ent, unwill|ingly driven him out of that cour&s;e; he will account it pre&s;umption for any one to pre|&s;cribe to him any time for calling that a&s;|&s;embly."</Q>
<PB N="220" REF="222">
This was generally con&s;trued as a declaration, that during that reign no more parliaments would be &s;ummoned; and every mea&s;ure of the king but too well &s;erved to confirm the &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>It was now that the people, without a de|fender, or hopes of redre&s;s, &s;aw them&s;elves at the mercy of a monarch, who, though good and gentle in his own nature, might at any time change in his conduct. They now &s;aw the con&s;titution at one blow wholly overthrown, and one branch of the legi&s;lature a&s;&s;uming tho&s;e rights, which had been divided between three. Tonnage and poundage were conti|nued to be levied by royal authority alone: cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers received orders from the council to enter any hou&s;e whatever, in &s;earch of &s;u&s;pected goods: compo&s;itions were openly made with papi&s;ts; and their religion was become a regular part of the revenue. The high commi&s;&s;ion court of Star-chamber exerci&s;ed its power, independent of any law, upon &s;everal bold innovators in liberty, who only gloried in their &s;ufferings, and contri|buted to render government odious and con|temptible. Sir David Foulis was fined by this court five thou&s;and pounds, merely for di&s;&s;uad|ing a friend from compounding with the com|mi&s;&s;ioners;
<PB N="221" REF="223">
who called upon him to take up the title of knighthood. Prynne, a barri&s;ter of Lincoln's inn, had written an enormous quar|to of a thou&s;and pages, which was entitled Hi&s;trioma&s;tix, or a Scourge for the Stage. In this, be&s;ide much paltry declamation again&s;t the &s;tage, he took occa&s;ion to blame the ce|remonies and late innovations of the church; and this was an offence that Laud was not like|ly to forgive. He was condemned by the Star-chamber to be degraded from the bar; to &s;tand in the pillory, in two places, We&s;tmin&s;ter and Cheap&s;ide; to lo&s;e his ears, one at each place; to pay five thou&s;and pounds to the king, and to be impri&s;oned during life. This &s;entence, which was equally cruel and unju&s;t, was rigo|rou&s;ly executed; and Prynne gloried in his &s;ufferings. Burton, a divine, and Ba&s;twick, a phy&s;ician, were tried before this tribunal for &s;chi&s;matical libels, in which they attacked, with great &s;everity and intemperate zeal, the ceremonies of the church of England. They were condemned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment that had been inflicted upon Prynne; and Prynne him&s;elf was al&s;o tried for a new offence, for which he was fined five thou&s;and pounds more, and &s;entenced to lo&s;e the re&s;t of his ears. The an&s;wers which the&s;e bold demagogues gave
<PB N="222" REF="224">
into court, were &s;o full of contumacy and in|vective, that no lawyer could be prevailed with to &s;ign them. The rigours, however, which they underwent, being &s;o unworthy men of their profe&s;&s;ion, gave general offence; and the patience, or rather alacrity with which they &s;uffered, encrea&s;ed &s;till further the public indignation.</P>
<P>The puritans, re&s;trained in England, &s;hipped them&s;elves off for America, where they laid the foundations of a new government, agree|able to their &s;y&s;tems of political freedom. But the government, unwilling that the nation &s;hould be deprived of its u&s;eful members, or dreading the unpopularity of the&s;e migrations, was prevailed on to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, de|barring tho&s;e devotees acce&s;s, even into tho&s;e inho&s;pitable regions. Eight &s;hips, lying in the Thames, and ready to &s;ail, were detained by order of coun&s;el; and in the&s;e were embarked Sir Arthur Hazlerig, John Hamden, and Oli|ver Cromwell, who had re&s;olved for ever to abandon their native country. This may &s;tand as a proof of the &s;incerity the&s;e men afterwards te&s;tified in the cau&s;e for which they fought; and is a clear proof that hypocri&s;y, with which they were charged, in the beginning at lea&s;t, was not among the motives of their oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">Every year, every month, every day, gave fre&s;h in&s;tances, during this long intermi&s;&s;ion of parliaments, of the re&s;olutions of the court to throw them off for ever: but the levying of <HI>&s;hip-money,</HI> as it was called, being a general burthen, was univer&s;ally complained of as a national grievance. This was a tax which had, in former reigns, been levied without the con|&s;ent of parliament; but then the exigency of the &s;tate demanded &s;uch a &s;upply. But as the nece&s;&s;ity at pre&s;ent was not &s;o apparent, and might excite murmurs among the people, a que&s;tion was propo&s;ed by the king to the judges, whether, in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, for the defence of the kingdom, he might not impo&s;e this tax? and whether he was not &s;ole judge of this nece&s;&s;ity? To this the judges replied that he might; and that he was &s;ole judge of the nece&s;&s;ity. In this univer&s;al appearance of obe|dience to the king's injunctions, John Ham|den, a gentleman of fortune in Buckingham|&s;hire, refu&s;ed to comply with the tax, and re|&s;olved to bring it to a legal determination. He had been rated at twenty-&s;hillings for his e&s;tate, which he refu&s;ed to pay; and the ca&s;e was argued twelve days in the Exchequer chamber, before all the judges of England. The nation regarded, with the utmo&s;t anxiety,
<PB N="224" REF="226">
the re&s;ult of a trial that was to fix the limits of the king's power; but after the former opi|nion of the judges on this &s;ubject, the event might have been ea&s;ily fore&s;een. All the judges, four only excepted, gave &s;entence in favour of the crown; while Hamden, who lo&s;t his cau&s;e, was more than &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed by the applau&s;es of the people. Nothing now was heard in every company but murmurs again&s;t government, and encomiums on him who had with&s;tood its u&s;urpations. It was now alleged, that tyranny was confirmed into &s;y&s;tem; and that there was no redre&s;s except in &s;ullen patience, or contented &s;lavery. Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny was thought to give aid to political inju&s;tice; and all the rights of the nation, tran&s;mitted through &s;o many ages, &s;e|cured by &s;o many laws, and purcha&s;ed by the blood of &s;o many heroes, now lay pro&s;trate in undi&s;tingui&s;hed neglect. In this univer&s;al &s;tate of de&s;pondence, or clamour, an accident gave the people of England an opportunity of vin|dicating their ancient privileges; and even of acquiring greater than was compatible with the &s;ubjects' happine&s;s to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The Scotch had, during the reign of James the fir&s;t, &s;hewed a &s;trong attachment to puri|tanical principles; and though they &s;till con|tinued
<PB N="225" REF="227">
to allow of bi&s;hops; yet they were re|duced to poverty, and treated with contempt. James, indeed, had &s;een the low e&s;tate of epi&s;|copacy in that kingdom, and had endeavour|ed to exalt and e&s;tabli&s;h it once more; but he died in the mid&s;t of his endeavours. It was the fate of Charles, for ever to aim at projects which were at once impracticable, and unne|ce&s;&s;ary; he re&s;olved, therefore, to complete what his father had begun. This ill-judged attempt &s;erved to alienate the affections of his Scotch &s;ubjects, as much as his encroachments on liberty had rendered him unpopular in Eng|land. The flame of &s;edition in Scotland, pa&s;&s;|ed from city to city, while the puritans formed a <HI>Covenant,</HI> to &s;upport and defend their opi|nions; and re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h their doctrines, or overturn the &s;tate. On the other hand, the court were determined to e&s;tabli&s;h the liturgy of the church of England; and both &s;ides be|ing ob&s;tinate in opinion, tho&s;e &s;anguinary mea|&s;ures were &s;oon begun in Scotland, which had hitherto been only talked of among the Eng|li&s;h.</P>
<P>The di&s;content and oppo&s;ition which the king met with in maintaining epi&s;copacy among his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects might, one would think, hinder him from attempting to intro|duce
<PB N="226" REF="228">
it among tho&s;e of Scotland; but &s;uch was his ardour, that he was re&s;olved to have it e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of his dominions. Having publi&s;hed an order for reading the liturgy in the principal church in Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and im|precations. The court-party, indeed, with great ju&s;tice, blamed their ob&s;tinacy, as the innovations were but trifling; but the people might have retorted with &s;till greater force the folly of their thus earne&s;tly attempting the e&s;tabli&s;hment of trifles. The &s;editious di&s;po&s;i|tion in that kingdom, which had hitherto been kept within bounds, was now too furious for re&s;traint, and the in&s;urrection became general over all the country.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till the king could not think of de&s;i&s;t|ing from his de&s;ign; and &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very name of king, when forcibly urged, would induce them to return to their duty. But he was &s;oon undeceived; the puritans of Scotland were republicans in principle, as well as tho&s;e in England; and they only wi&s;hed to &s;ee the bi&s;hops fir&s;t humbled, in order to make a more &s;ucce&s;sful attack upon unguarded monarchy. Charles, therefore, finding them in arms, and that they in&s;i&s;ted on di&s;placing the
<PB N="227" REF="229">
bi&s;hops, con&s;idered their demands as an open declaration of war; and accordingly &s;ummon|ed &s;uch of the nobility of England as held lands of the crown, to furni&s;h him with a proper number of forces to oppo&s;e them. To add to the&s;e &s;upplies, he demanded a vo|luntary contribution from the clergy, as he was, in fact, fighting their cau&s;e; and by means of his queen, the catholics were al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By the&s;e methods he &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of an un|di&s;ciplined and reluctant army, amounting to about twenty thou&s;and men, and commanded by generals le&s;s willing to fight than to nego|ciate. His &s;uperiority in numbers, however, gave him the manife&s;t advantage over his re|bellious &s;ubjects, who were no way &s;low in marching to give him battle. But Charles, who inherited the peaceable di&s;po&s;ition of his father, was unwilling to come to extremities, although a blow then &s;truck with vigour might have prevented many of his &s;ucceeding misfortunes. In&s;tead of fighting with his op|ponents, he entered upon a treaty with them; &s;o that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was &s;oon agreed upon, and a treaty of peace concluded, which neither &s;ide intended to ob&s;erve; and then both parties agreed to di&s;band their forces. This
<PB N="228" REF="230">
&s;tep of di&s;banding the army was a fatal mea|&s;ure to Charles, as he could not levy a new army without great labour and expence; while the Scotch in&s;urgents, who were all volunteers in the &s;ervice, could be mu&s;tered again at plea|&s;ure. Of this the heads of the malcontents &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible; for they lengthened out the negotiations with affected difficulties, and threw in ob&s;tructions, in proportion as they were confident of their own &s;uperiority. At length, after much altercation, and many trea|ties &s;igned and broken, both parties once more had recour&s;e to arms, and nothing but blood could &s;atiate the contenders.</P>
<P>War being thus re&s;olved on, the king took every method as before for rai&s;ing money to &s;upport it. Ship-money was levied as u&s;ual; &s;ome other arbitrary taxes were exacted from the reluctant people with great &s;everity; but one method of rai&s;ing the &s;upplies reflects im|mortal honour on tho&s;e who contributed. The coun&s;ellors and &s;ervants of the crown lent the king whatever &s;ums they could &s;pare, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed their private fortunes to gratify their &s;overeign. The&s;e were the re&s;ources of the crown to prepare an army; but they were far from being &s;ufficient; and there now remained only one method more, the long-neglected method of a parliamentary &s;upply.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231">It was now above eleven years &s;ince the king had called a parliament.<MILESTONE N="1640" UNIT="A.D."> The fierce and ungovernable &s;pirit of the la&s;t had taught him to hate and to fear &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly; but all re&s;ources being exhau&s;ted, and great debts contracted, he was obliged to call another par|liament, from which he had no great rea&s;on to expect any favour. The many illegal, and the numerous imprudent &s;teps of the crown, the hard&s;hips which &s;everal per&s;ons had &s;uffer|ed, and their con&s;tancy in undergoing puni&s;h|ment, had as much alienated the affections of the king's Engli&s;h as of his Scotch &s;ubjects. In&s;tead of &s;upplies the king was harra&s;&s;ed with murmurs and complaints. The zealous in religion were plea&s;ed with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the crown, in its attempts again&s;t their bre|thren in opinion; and the real friends to the liberties of mankind &s;aw, with their u&s;ual penetration, that the time was approaching when the royal authority mu&s;t fall into a to|tal dependence on popular a&s;&s;emblies, and when public freedom mu&s;t acquire a full a&s;cendant.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of commons, therefore, could not be induced to treat the Scotch, who were of the &s;ame principles with them&s;elves, and contending again&s;t the &s;ame ceremonies, as ene|mies
<PB N="230" REF="232">
to the &s;tate. They regarded them as friends and brothers, who fir&s;t ro&s;e to teach them a duty it was incumbent on all virtuous minds to imitate. The king, therefore, could reap no other fruits from this a&s;&s;embly than murmurings and complaints. Every method he had taken to &s;upply him&s;elf with money was declared an abu&s;e, and a breach of the con&s;titution. Tonnage and poundage, &s;hip-money, the &s;ale of monopolies, the billeting &s;oldiers upon refractory citizens, were all voted as &s;tretches of arbitrary power. The king finding no hopes of redre&s;s from the commons, had recour&s;e to the hou&s;e of peers; but this was equally ineffectual with the former ap|plication. The king, therefore, finding no hopes of a compliance with his reque&s;t, but recrimination in&s;tead of redre&s;s, once more di&s;|&s;olved the parliament, to try more fea&s;ible methods of removing his nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The king having now made enemies of his Scotch &s;ubjects, by controlling them in their mode of wor&s;hip, and of the commons by di&s;&s;olving them, it remained to exa&s;perate the city of London again&s;t him by &s;ome new im|prudence. Upon their refu&s;ing to lend him money to carry on the Scotch war, he &s;ued the citizens in the Star-chamber for &s;ome lands
<PB N="231" REF="233">
in Ireland, and made them pay a con&s;iderable fine. He continued al&s;o to exact all the taxes again&s;t which every former parliament had re|mon&s;trated; but all were in&s;ufficient. A loan of forty thou&s;and pounds was extorted from the Spani&s;h merchants, who had bullion in the Tower, expo&s;ed to the attempts of the king. Coat and conduct money for the &s;oldiers was levied on the counties; an ancient practice, but &s;uppo&s;ed to be aboli&s;hed by the petition of right. All the pepper was bought from the Ea&s;t India company upon tru&s;t, and &s;old at a great di&s;count for ready money. A &s;cheme was propo&s;ed for coining two or three hundred thou&s;and pounds of ba&s;e money; and yet all the&s;e methods were far from being effectual. The Scotch, therefore, &s;en&s;ible of the extre|mities to which he was reduced, led on an army of twenty thou&s;and men as far as New-ca&s;tle upon Tyne, to lay their grievances be|fore their &s;overeign, as they were plea&s;ed to term their rebellion. One of the mo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;ting &s;trokes in the puritanical character of the times, was this gentle language and hum|ble cant, in the mid&s;t of trea&s;on; and their flattery to their prince, while they were at|tempting to dethrone and de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>To the&s;e troops, in&s;pired by religion, flu&s;hed with &s;ome &s;light victories obtained over &s;trag|gling
<PB N="232" REF="234">
parties of the royali&s;ts, and encouraged by the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, among whom they continued, the king was able to oppo&s;e only a &s;maller force, new levied, undi&s;ciplined, &s;editious, and ill paid. Being therefore in de&s;pair of &s;temming the torrent, he at la&s;t yielded to it. He fir&s;t &s;ummoned a great council of peers to York; and, as he fore&s;aw that they would advi&s;e him to call a parlia|ment, he told them in his fir&s;t &s;peech that he had already taken that re&s;olution. Having thus prepared for his misfortunes, he a &s;hort time after called that long parliament,<MILESTONE N="Nov. 3, 1640."> which never di&s;continued &s;itting till they finally ac|compli&s;hed his ruin.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. CHARLES I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE ardent expectations of men with re|gard to a parliament at &s;uch a critical juncture, and during &s;uch general di&s;contents, might na|turally engage the attendance of the members on their duty. The hou&s;e of commons was never, from its fir&s;t in&s;titution, ob&s;erved to be &s;o numerous, or the a&s;&s;iduity of its members greater. Without any interval, therefore, they entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and by unani|mous con&s;ent they &s;truck a blow that might be regarded as deci&s;ive. In&s;tead of granting the demanded &s;ub&s;idies, they impeached the earl of Strafford, the king's fir&s;t mini&s;ter, and had him arraigned before the hou&s;e of peers for high trea&s;on. Pym, a tedious, but &s;en&s;i|ble &s;peaker, who had fir&s;t opened the accu&s;a|tion again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons, was &s;ent up to defend it at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords; and mo&s;t of the hou&s;e accompanied their member on &s;o agreeable an errand.</P>
<P>To be&s;tow the greate&s;t &s;olemnity on this im|portant trial, &s;caffolds were erected in We&s;t|min&s;ter Hall, where both hou&s;es &s;at, the one as judges, the other as accu&s;ers. Be&s;ide the
<PB N="234" REF="236">
chair of &s;tate, a clo&s;e gallery was prepared for the king and queen, who attended during the whole trial. The articles of impeachment again&s;t him were twenty-eight in number, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, that he had attempted to extend the king's authority at home, and had been guilty of &s;everal exactions in Ireland. But though four months were employed by the managers in framing the accu&s;ation, yet there appears very little ju&s;t cau&s;e of blame in him, &s;ince the &s;tretches of the king's power were made before he came into authority. How|ever, the managers for the hou&s;e of commons pleaded again&s;t him with vehemence &s;tronger than their rea&s;ons, and &s;ummed up their argu|ments, by in&s;i&s;ting, that though each article taken &s;eparately did not amount to a proof, yet the whole taken together might be fairly concluded to carry conviction. This is a method of arguing frequently u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h courts of ju&s;tice even at this day: and perhaps none can be more erroneous; for almo&s;t every fal&s;e|hood may be found to have a multiplicity of weak rea&s;ons to &s;upport it. In this tumult of aggravation and clamour, the earl him&s;elf, who&s;e parts and wi&s;dom had been long re|&s;pectable, &s;tood unmoved and undaunted. He defended his cau&s;e with all the pre&s;ence of
<PB N="235" REF="237">
mind, judgment, and &s;agacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed be&s;ide him as he was thus defending his life, and the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter. After he had in a long and eloquent &s;peech, delivered without premeditation, con|futed all the accu&s;ations of his enemies; af|ter he had &s;hewn that during his government in Ireland, he had introduced the arts of peace among the &s;avage part of that people; after he had declared, that though his mea&s;ures in England were har&s;h, he &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity by which he was driven into them, &s;ince his coming over; after he had clearly refuted the argument upon the accumulative force of his guilt, he thus drew to a conclu&s;ion.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, my lords, I have troubled you too long; longer than I &s;hould have done, but for the &s;ake of the&s;e dear pledges, which a &s;aint in heaven has left me."</Q>
&mdash;Upon this he pau&s;ed, dropped a tear, looked upon his children, and proceeded.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What I forfeit for my&s;elf is a trifle; that my indi&s;cretions &s;hould reach my po&s;terity, wounds me to the heart.&mdash; Pardon my infirmity.&mdash;Something I &s;hould have added, but am not able; therefore let it pa&s;s. And now, my lords, for my&s;elf; I have long been taught that the afflictions of
<PB N="236" REF="238">
this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory which awaits the innocent; and &s;o my lords, even &s;o, with the utmo&s;t tran|quillity, I &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your judg|ment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done."</Q>
His eloquence and innocence in|duced tho&s;e judges to pity, who were the mo&s;t zealous to condemn him. The king him&s;elf went to the hou&s;e of lords, and &s;poke for &s;ome time in his defence; but the &s;pirit of ven|geance that had been chained for eleven years, was now rouzed, and nothing but his blood could give the people &s;atisfaction. He was found guilty by both hou&s;es of parliament; and nothing remained but for the king to give his con&s;ent to the bill of attainder. But in the pre&s;ent commotions the con&s;ent of the king was a thing that would very ea&s;ily be di&s;|pen&s;ed with; and imminent dangers might at|tend his refu&s;al. Yet &s;till Charles, who loved Strafford tenderly, he&s;itated, and &s;eemed re|luctant, trying every expedient to put off &s;o dreadful a duty, as that of &s;igning the warrant for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to act, his doubts were at la&s;t &s;ilenced by an act of heroic bravery in the condemned lord. He
<PB N="237" REF="239">
received a letter from that unfortunate noble|man, de&s;iring that his life might be made the &s;acrifice of a mutual reconciliation between the king and his people; adding, that he was prepared to die, and to a willing mind there could be no injury. This in&s;tance of noble genero&s;ity was but ill repaid by his ma&s;ter, who complied with his reque&s;t. He con&s;ent|ed to the &s;igning the fatal bill by commi&s;&s;ion; Strafford was beheaded on Tower-hill, behav|ing with all that compo&s;ed dignity of re&s;olu|tion that was expected from his character. The people, taught by his death to trample upon the rights of humanity, &s;oon after re&s;olved to &s;hed blood that was &s;till more precious.</P>
<P>But the commons did not &s;top their im|peachments here. Laud al&s;o, after a delibera|tion which did not continue half an hour, was con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently culpable to incur the &s;ame accu&s;ation, and was committed to cu&s;to|dy. Finch, the lord keeper, was al&s;o impeach|ed; but he had the precaution to make his e&s;cape, and fly over into Holland, as did Sir Francis Wyndebank, the &s;ecretary, into France.</P>
<P>The crown being thus deprived of the &s;er|vices of its mini&s;ters, the commons next pro|ceeded to attack the few privileges it &s;till
<PB N="238" REF="240">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. During the late military opera|tions, &s;everal powers had been exerted by the lieutenants, and deputy-lieutenants of coun|ties, men who were all under the influence of the crown. The&s;e were, therefore, voted <HI>Delinquents</HI>; a term now fir&s;t u&s;ed to &s;ignify tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who&s;e crimes were not as yet a&s;|certained by law. The &s;heriffs al&s;o, who had obeyed the king's mandate in rai&s;ing &s;hip-mo|ney, were voted al&s;o to be delinquents. All the farmers and officers of the cu&s;toms, who had been employed during &s;o many years in levying tonnage and poundage, were &s;ubjected to the &s;ame imputation, and only purcha&s;ed their &s;afety by paying an hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. Every di&s;cretionary or arbitrary &s;entence of the Star-chamber, and High commi&s;&s;ion courts, underwent a &s;evere &s;crutiny; and all tho&s;e who had any hand in &s;uch &s;entences were voted to be liable to the penalties of the law. The judges, who had declared again&s;t Hamden in the trial of &s;hip-money, were accu&s;ed before the peers, and obliged to find &s;ecurity for their appearance. All tho&s;e monopolies which had been lately granted by the crown, were now annihilated by the order of the commons; and they carried their dete&s;tation of that grievance &s;o far, as to
<PB N="239" REF="241">
expel from their own hou&s;e all &s;uch members as had been monopoli&s;ts or projectors.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een the commons in &s;ome mea&s;ure the patrons of liberty and of the peo|ple; boldly oppo&s;ing the &s;tretches of illegal power, or repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e claims which, tho' founded on cu&s;tom, were de&s;tructive of free|dom. Thus far their aims, their &s;truggles, were ju&s;t and honourable: but the general pa&s;&s;ions of the nation were now excited; and having been once put into motion, they &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the line, and knew not where to &s;top. Had they been contented with re&s;ting here, af|ter abridging all tho&s;e privileges of monarchy which were capable of injuring the &s;ubject, and leaving it all tho&s;e prerogatives that could benefit, they would have been con&s;idered as the great benefactors of mankind, and would have left the con&s;titution pretty nearly on the &s;ame footing on which we enjoy it at pre&s;ent. But they either were willing to revenge their former &s;ufferings, or thought that &s;ome terri|ble examples were nece&s;&s;ary to deter others from attempting to en&s;lave their country. The horrors of a civil war were not &s;ufficiently at|tended to; and they precipitately involved the nation in calamities which they them&s;elves were the fir&s;t to repent.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242">The whole nation was thrown into a ge|neral ferment. The harangues of the mem|bers, now fir&s;t publi&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed, kept alive the horrors which were felt for the late admini&s;tration. The pulpits, delivered over to the puritanical preachers, whom the commons arbitrarily placed in all the con&s;iderable churches, re&s;ounded with faction and fanati|ci&s;m. The pre&s;s, freed from all fear or re|&s;traint, &s;warmed with productions, dangerous by their &s;edition and calumny, more than by their eloquence or &s;tyle.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al uproar again&s;t the crown, Prynne, Burton, and Ba&s;twick, who had &s;ome years before &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely for their licen|tious abu&s;es, and had been committed to re|mote pri&s;ons, were &s;et at liberty by or|der of the commons, and were &s;een making their triumphant entry into the capital. Ba&s;t|wick had been confined in Scilly, Burton in Jer&s;ey, and Prynne in Guern&s;ey; and upon landing at their re&s;pective places they were re|ceived by the acclamations of the people, and attended by crowds to London. Boughs were carried in this tumultuous proce&s;&s;ion; the roads were &s;trewed with flowers, their &s;uffer|ings were aggravated, and their per&s;ecutors reviled. Every per&s;on who had been puni&s;hed
<PB N="241" REF="243">
for &s;editious libels during the foregoing admi|ni&s;tration, now recovered their liberty, and had damages given them upon tho&s;e who had de|creed their puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Grievances had, no doubt, and heavy ones, been endured during the la&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion of parliaments; but the very complaints again&s;t them now became one of the greate&s;t griev|ances. So many were offered within doors, and petitioned again&s;t without, that the hou&s;e was divided into above forty committees, charged each of them with the examination of its re&s;pective complaints. The torrent ri&s;ing to &s;o dreadful and unexpected an height, de|&s;pair &s;eized all tho&s;e who, from intere&s;t or ha|bit, were attached to monarchy; while the king him&s;elf &s;aw, with amazement, the whole fabric of government totally overturned.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have taken, &s;aid he to the parliament, the whole machine of government to pieces; a practice frequent with &s;kilful arti&s;ts, when they de&s;ire to clear the wheels from any ru&s;t which may have grown upon them. The en|gine may be re&s;tored to its former u&s;e and mo|tions, provided it be fitted up entire, &s;o as not a pin be wanting."</Q>
But the commons, in their pre&s;ent temper, were much better adapted to de&s;troy than to fit up; and having taken
<PB N="242" REF="244">
the machine a&s;under, they &s;oon found an ex|peditious &s;et of workmen ready, to &s;tep in and take the whole bu&s;ine&s;s off their hands.</P>
<P>But in this univer&s;al rage for aboli&s;hing the former con&s;titution, the parliament fell with great ju&s;tice on two courts, which had been erected under arbitrary kings, and had &s;eldom been employed but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. The&s;e were, the High-commi&s;&s;ion court, and the court of Star-chamber. A bill unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;es to aboli&s;h both; and in them to an|nihilate the principal and mo&s;t dangerous ar|ticles in the king's prerogative. The fir&s;t of tho&s;e, which was in&s;tituted for defending the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the church, had great power in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters; and the judges in that court were entirely arbitrary in whatever puni&s;hments, or fines, they thought proper to inflict. The Star-chamber had given force to the king's proclamations, and puni&s;hed &s;uch as ventured to tran&s;gre&s;s them; but that being now taken away, his proclamations were of no effect, and might be oppo&s;ed with im|punity. Such were, the tran&s;actions of this fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the long parliament; and tho' in &s;ome ca&s;es they acted with anger, and in others with precipitation, yet their merits &s;o much overbalanced their mi&s;takes, that they de&s;erve the highe&s;t gratitude from po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="245">After this, the parliament &s;eemingly ad|journed; but a committee of both hou&s;es, a thing altogether unprecedented, was appoint|ed to &s;it during the rece&s;s, with very ample powers, and very little le&s;s than tho&s;e of the parliament in the plenitude of its authority. Pym was appointed chairman of the lower hou&s;e; in this further attempts were made for a&s;&s;uming the &s;overeign executive powers, and publi&s;hing the ordinances of this committee as &s;tatutes enacted by all the branches of the legi&s;lature. In the mean the king went to pay a vi&s;it to his &s;ubjects in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, the papi&s;ts of Ireland fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the Engli&s;h yoke. There was a gentleman called Roger More, who, though of a narrow fortune, was de&s;cend|ed from a very ancient Iri&s;h family, and was very much celebrated among his countrymen for his valour and capacity. This man fir&s;t formed the project of expelling the Engli&s;h, and a&s;&s;erting the independency of his native country. The occa&s;ion was favourable; the Engli&s;h, warmly engaged in dome&s;tic animo&s;i|ties, were unable to attend to a di&s;tant in&s;urrec|tion; and tho&s;e of that nation, who re&s;ided among them, were too feeble to re&s;i&s;t. Struck with
<PB N="244" REF="246">
the&s;e motives, Sir Phelim O'Neale entered in|to a con&s;piracy; lord Macguire came into his de&s;igns, and &s;oon after all the chiefs of the native Iri&s;h promi&s;ed their concurrence.</P>
<P>Their plan was laid accordingly, which was, that Sir Phelim O'Neale, and the other con|&s;pirators, &s;hould all begin an in&s;urrection on one day throughout the provinces; &s;hould de|&s;troy all the Engli&s;h, while lord Macguire, and Roger More, &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Dublin. They had fixed on the approach of winter for this revolt, the day was appointed, every thing in readine&s;s, the &s;ecret profoundly kept, and the con&s;pirators promi&s;ed them|&s;elves a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. The earl of Leice&s;|ter, who had been appointed lord lieutenant, was then in London. Sir William Par&s;ons, and Sir John Borlace, the two lords ju&s;tices, were men of mean intellects; and, without attending to the intere&s;ts of their country, indulged them|&s;elves in the mo&s;t profound tranquility on the very brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The very day before the intended &s;eizure of the ca&s;tle of Dublin, the plot was di&s;covered by one O'Connolly, an Iri&s;hman, but a pro|te&s;tant, to the ju&s;tices, who fled to the ca&s;tle, and alarmed all the prote&s;tant inhabitants of the city to prepare for their defence. Mac|guire
<PB N="245" REF="247">
was taken, but More e&s;caped; and new informations being every hour added to tho&s;e already received, the project of a general in|&s;urrection was no longer a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But though the citizens of Dublin had ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave them&s;elves from danger; the prote&s;tants di&s;per&s;ed over the different parts of the country, were taken unprepared. O'Neale and his confederates had already taken arms in Ul&s;ter. The Iri&s;h, every where inter|mingled with the Engli&s;h, needed but a hint from their leaders and prie&s;ts to ma&s;&s;acre a people whom they hated for their religion, and envied for their riches and pro&s;perity. The in|&s;urrections of a civilized people, are u&s;ually marked with very little cruelty; but the revolt of a &s;avage nation, generally aims at extermina|tion. The Iri&s;h accordingly re&s;olved to cut off all the prote&s;tants of the kingdom at a &s;troke; &s;o that neither age, &s;ex, or condition, received any pity. In &s;uch indi&s;criminate &s;laughter, nei|ther former benefits, nor alliances, nor authori|ty, were any protection: numberle&s;s were the in&s;tances of friends murdering their intimates, relations their kin&s;men, and &s;ervants their ma&s;|ters. In vain did flight &s;ave from the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault; de&s;truction, that had an exten&s;ive &s;pread, met the hunted victims at every turn.
<PB N="246" REF="248">
Not only death, but &s;tudied cruelties were inflicted on the unhappy &s;ufferers; the very avarice of the revolters could not re&s;train their thir&s;t for blood, and they burned the inhabi|tants in their own hou&s;es to encrea&s;e their pu|ni&s;hment. Several hundreds were driven up|on a bridge; and from thence obliged, by the&s;e barbarians, to leap into the water, where they were drowned. The Engli&s;h colonies were totally annihilated in the open country of Ul|&s;ter; but in the other provinces the rebels pre|tended to act with greater humanity.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tants were driven there from their hou&s;es, to meet the &s;everity of the weather, without food or raiment, and numbers of them peri&s;hed with the cold, which happened at that time to be peculiarly &s;evere. By &s;ome computations, tho&s;e who peri&s;hed by all the&s;e cruelties, are made to amount to an hundred and fifty, or two hundred thou&s;and; but, by a moderate computation, they could not have been le&s;s than forty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h Pale, as it was called, con&s;i&s;ting of the old Engli&s;h catholics, who had fir&s;t come over, joining with the na|tive Iri&s;h, a large army was formed, amounting to above twenty thou&s;and men, which threaten|ed a total extermination of the Engli&s;h power
<PB N="247" REF="249">
in that i&s;land. The king was at that time in Scotland, when he received the fir&s;t accounts of this rebellion; and though he did all in his power to induce his &s;ubjects there to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, yet he found them totally aver&s;e to &s;ending any &s;uccours into Ireland. Their aim was to oblige the parliament of England, with what &s;uccours they could &s;pare, and not to obey the injunc|tions of their &s;overeign. They went &s;till far|ther, and had the a&s;&s;urance to impute a part of the&s;e dreadful ma&s;&s;acres to the king's own contrivance. In fact, the rebels of Ireland did not fail to &s;hew a royal patent, authori&s;ing their attempts; and it is &s;aid that Sir Phelim O'Neale, having found a royal patent in lord Caulfield's hou&s;e, whom he had murdered, he tore off the &s;eal, and affixed it to a commi&s;&s;ion which he had forged for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>However this be, the king took all the pre|cautions in his power to &s;hew his utter dete&s;ta|tion of the&s;e bloody proceedings; and being &s;en&s;ible of his own inability to &s;uppre&s;s the re|bellion, he had once more recour&s;e to his Eng|li&s;h parliament, and craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for a &s;upply. But here he found no hopes of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; many in&s;inuations were thrown out that he had him&s;elf fomented this rebellion,
<PB N="248" REF="250">
and no money could be &s;pared for the extinc|tion of di&s;tant dangers, when they pretended that the kingdom was threatened with greater at home.</P>
<P>It was now that the republican &s;pirit began to appear without any di&s;gui&s;e in the pre|&s;ent parliament; and that party, in&s;tead of attacking the faults of the king, re&s;olved to de&s;troy monarchy. They had &s;een a republi|can &s;y&s;tem of government lately e&s;tabli&s;hed in Holland, and attended with very noble effects; they began, therefore, to wi&s;h for a &s;imilar &s;y&s;tem at home, and many productions of the pre&s;s at that time &s;ketched out the form. It would be unju&s;t to deny the&s;e men the prai&s;e of be|ing guided by hone&s;t motives; but it would be unwi&s;e not to &s;ay al&s;o, that they were &s;wayed by wrong ones. In the compari&s;on between a republic and a limited monarchy, the ba|lance entirely inclines to the latter, &s;ince a real republic never yet exi&s;ted, except in &s;pecula|tion; and that liberty which demagogues pro|mi&s;e to their followers, is generally only &s;ought after for them&s;elves. The aim in general of popular leaders, is rather to depre&s;s the great than exalt the humble; and in &s;uch govern|ments, the lower ranks of people are too com|monly the mo&s;t abject &s;laves. In a republic,
<PB N="249" REF="251">
the number of tyrants are capable of &s;upport|ing each other in their inju&s;tice; while in a monarchy there is one object, who, if he offends, is ea&s;ily puni&s;hable, and ought to be brought to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The leaders of the oppo&s;ition began their operations by a re&s;olution to attack epi&s;co|pacy, which was one of the &s;tronge&s;t bul|warks of the royal power; but previou&s;ly framed a remon&s;trance, in which they &s;um|moned up all their former grievances.<MILESTONE N="1641" UNIT="A.D."> The&s;e they a&s;cribed to a regular &s;y&s;tem of tyranny in the king, and a&s;&s;erted that they amounted to a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution. This, when drawn up by a tumultuous majority of the hou&s;e, they ordered to be printed and publi&s;hed, without being carried up, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, to the hou&s;e of peers, for their a&s;&s;ent and approbation. The commons hav|ing thus endeavoured to render the king's admini&s;tration univer&s;ally odious, they began upon the hierarchy. Their fir&s;t mea&s;ure was, by their own &s;ingle authority, to &s;u&s;pend all the laws which had been made for the ob&s;er|vance of public wor&s;hip. They particularly forbade bowing at the name of Je&s;us. They complained of the king's filling five vacant bi&s;hoprics; and con&s;idered it as an in&s;ult upon
<PB N="250" REF="252">
them, that he &s;hould complete and &s;trengthen an order which they were re&s;olved to aboli&s;h. They accu&s;ed thirteen bi&s;hops of high trea&s;on, for enacting canons without the con&s;ent of parliament; and endeavoured to prevail upon the hou&s;e of peers to exclude all the prelates from their &s;eats and votes, in that augu&s;t a&s;|&s;embly. But notwith&s;tanding all their ef|forts, the lords refu&s;ed their concurrence to this law; and all &s;uch as any way tended to the farther limitation of royal authority. The majority of the peers adhered to the king; and plainly fore&s;aw the depre&s;&s;ion of the nobility as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the popular u&s;ur|pations on the crown. The commons mur|mured at their refu&s;al, mixed threats with their indignation, and began, for the fir&s;t time, to in&s;inuate that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate could be carried on without them.</P>
<P>In order to intimidate the lords into their mea&s;ures, the populace was let loo&s;e to in&s;ult and threaten them. Multitudes of people flocked every day towards We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in&s;ulted the prelates, and &s;uch lords as ad|hered to the crown. Some &s;editious appren|tices being &s;eized and committed to pri&s;on, the hou&s;e of commons immediately ordered them to be &s;et free. Encouraged by the coun|tenance
<PB N="251" REF="253">
of the hou&s;e, the populace crowded about Whitehall, and threw out in&s;olent menaces again&s;t the king him&s;elf. It was at this time that &s;everal reduced officers and &s;tudents of the inns of court, offered their &s;ervices to the king, to repre&s;s the rioters; and many frays en&s;ued not without blood&s;hed. The rabble, by way of reproach, were called Round-heads, from the manner of wearing their hair, and the gentlemen Cavaliers. The&s;e names afterwards &s;erved to di&s;tingui&s;h the par|tizans of either &s;ide, and &s;erved &s;till more to divide the nation.</P>
<P>The fury of the commons, and al&s;o of the populace, did not fail to intimidate the bi&s;hops; they &s;aw the &s;torm that was gather|ing again&s;t them; and, probably, to avert its effects, they re&s;olved to attend their duty in the hou&s;e of lords no longer; but drew up a prote&s;t, which was &s;igned by twelve of them, in which they declared, that being hindered by the populace from attending at the hou&s;e of lords, they re&s;olved to go there no more till all commotions &s;hould be appea&s;ed; pro|te&s;ting, in the mean time, again&s;t all &s;uch laws as &s;hould be enacted in their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>This &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hops from the hou&s;e of lords was what the commons mo&s;t ardently
<PB N="252" REF="254">
wi&s;hed for; and they &s;eized the opportunity with plea&s;ure. An impeachment of high trea|&s;on was immediately &s;ent up again&s;t them, as guilty of &s;ubverting the fundamental laws, and invalidating the legi&s;lative authority. In con&s;equence of this, they were by the lords excluded from parliament, and committed to cu&s;tody, no man in either hou&s;e daring to &s;peak a word in their vindication. One of the lords, indeed, was heard to &s;ay, that he did not believe they were guilty of trea&s;on, but he thought they were mad, and therefore were fitter for Bedlam, than a &s;eat in parliament.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to the royal intere&s;t; but it &s;oon felt a much greater from the king's own imprudence. Charles had long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment and only &s;trove to &s;atisfy the commons by the greatne&s;s of his conce&s;&s;ions; but finding that all his compliance had but encrea&s;ed their demands, he could no longer contain. He gave orders to Herbert, his at|torney general, to enter an accu&s;ation of high trea&s;on in the hou&s;e of peers again&s;t lord Kim|bolton, one of the mo&s;t popular men of his party, together with five commoners, Sir Ar|thur Ha&s;lerig, Hollis, Hambden, Pym, and Strode. The articles were, that they had trai|terou&s;ly endeavoured to &s;ubvert the funda|mental
<PB N="253" REF="255">
laws and government of the kingdom; to deprive the king of his regal power, and to impo&s;e on his &s;ubjects an arbitrary and ty|rannical authority; that they had invited a foreign army to invade the kingdom; that they had aimed at &s;ubverting the very rights and being of parliaments, and had actually rai&s;ed and countenanced tumults again&s;t the king. Men had &s;carce lei&s;ure to wonder at the precipitancy and imprudence of this im|peachment, when they were a&s;toni&s;hed by ano|ther mea&s;ure, &s;till more ra&s;h and more un&s;up|ported. A &s;erjeant at arms, in the king's name, demanded of the hou&s;e the five members, and was &s;ent back without any po&s;itive an&s;wer. This was followed by a conduct &s;till more ex|traordinary. The next day the king him&s;elf was &s;een to enter the hou&s;e of commons alone, advancing through the hall, while all the members &s;tood up to receive him. The &s;peaker withdrew from his chair, and the king took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Having &s;eated him&s;elf, and looked round him for &s;ome time, he told the hou&s;e that he was &s;orry for the occa&s;ion that forced him thither, that he was come in per&s;on to &s;eize the members, whom he had accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, &s;eeing they would not deliver them up to his &s;erjeant at arms. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="254" REF="256">
him&s;elf to the &s;peaker, he de&s;ired to know whether any of them were in the hou&s;e; but the &s;peaker falling on his knees, replied, that he had neither eyes to &s;ee, nor tongue to &s;peak in that place, but as the hou&s;e was plea&s;|ed to direct him; and he a&s;ked pardon for being able to give no other an&s;wer. He then &s;ate for &s;ome time to &s;ee if the accu&s;ed were pre&s;ent; but they had e&s;caped a few minutes before his entry. Thus di&s;appointed, perplexed, and not knowing on whom to rely, he next proceeded, amid&s;t the clamours of the popu|lace, who continued to cry out, <Q REND="inline">"Privilege! privilege!"</Q> to the common council of the city, and made his complaint to them. The common council only an&s;wered his complaints with a contemptuous &s;ilence; and on his re|turn, one of the populace, more in&s;olent than the re&s;t, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"To your tents, O I&s;rael!"</Q> a watch word among the Jews, when they in|tended to abandon their princes.</P>
<P>When the commons were a&s;&s;embled the next day, they affected the greate&s;t terror, and pa&s;&s;ed an unanimous vote that the king had violated their privileges, and that they could not a&s;&s;emble again in the &s;ame place, till they &s;hould have obtained &s;atisfaction, with a guard for their &s;ecurity. They a&s;cribed the la&s;t mea|&s;ure
<PB N="255" REF="257">
of the king to the coun&s;els of the papi&s;ts, and the city was thus filled with groundle&s;s con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>As the commons had artfully kept up their panic, in order to enflame the populace, and as the city was now only one &s;cene of confu|&s;ion, the king, afraid of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to any fre&s;h in&s;ult from the fury of the populace, retired to Wind&s;or, overwhelmed with grief, &s;hame, and remor&s;e. There he began to re|flect on the ra&s;hne&s;s of his former proceedings; and now too late re&s;olved to make &s;ome atone|ment. He therefore wrote to the parliament, informing them, that he de&s;i&s;ted from his for|mer proceedings again&s;t the accu&s;ed members; and a&s;&s;ured them, that upon all occa&s;ions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his crown. Thus his former vio|lence had rendered him hateful to his com|mons, and his pre&s;ent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion now rendered him contemptible.</P>
<P>The commons had already &s;tript the king of almo&s;t all his privileges; the bi&s;hops were fled, the judges were intimidated; it now only remained that, after &s;ecuring the church and the law, they &s;hould get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;word al&s;o. The power of appointing governors, generals, and levying armies, was &s;till a re|maining
<PB N="256" REF="258">
prerogative of the crown. Having, therefore, fir&s;t magnified their terrors of po|pery, which perhaps they actually dreaded, they proceeded to petition that the Tower might be put into their hands, and that Hull, Port&s;mouth, and the fleet, &s;hould be intru&s;ted to per&s;ons of their chu&s;ing. The&s;e were re|que&s;ts, the complying with which levelled all that remained of the ancient con&s;titution; however, &s;uch was the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, that they were at fir&s;t conte&s;ted, and then grant|ed. At la&s;t, every compliance only encrea&s;|ing the avidity of making fre&s;h demands, the commons de&s;ired to have a militia, rai&s;ed and governed by &s;uch officers and commanders as they &s;hould nominate, under pretext of &s;ecu|ring them from the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, of whom they were in great apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was here that Charles fir&s;t ventured to put a &s;top to his conce&s;&s;ions; and that not by a refu&s;al, but a delay. He was at that time at Dover, attending the queen, and the prince&s;s of Orange, who had thought prudent to leave the kingdom. He replied to the petition of the commons, that he had not now lei&s;ure to con|&s;ider a matter of &s;uch great importance; and therefore would defer an an&s;wer till his return. But the commons were well aware, that though
<PB N="257" REF="259">
this was depriving him even of the &s;hadow of power; yet they had now gone too far to re|cede, and were therefore de&s;irous of leaving him no authority what&s;oever, as being con|&s;cious that them&s;elves would be the fir&s;t victims to its fury. They alleged, that the dangers and di&s;tempers of the nation were &s;uch as could endure no longer delay; and unle&s;s the king &s;peedily complied with their demands, they &s;hould be obliged, both for his &s;afety and that of the kingdom, to di&s;po&s;e of the militia by the authority of both hou&s;es, and were re|&s;olved to do it accordingly. In their remon|&s;trances to the king, they de&s;ired even to be permitted to command the army for an ap|pointed time; which &s;o exa&s;perated him, that he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, not for an hour."</Q> This peremptory refu&s;al broke off all further trea|ty; and both &s;ides were now re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to arms.</P>
<P>Charles, taking the prince of Wales with him, retired to York, where he found the peo|ple more loyal, and le&s;s infected with the reli|gious frenzy of the times. He found his cau&s;e there backed by a more numerous party than he had expected among the people. The queen, who was in Holland, was making &s;uc|ce&s;sful levies of men and ammunition, by &s;ell|ing
<PB N="258" REF="260">
the crown-jewels. But before war was openly declared the &s;hadow of a negotiation was carried on, rather to &s;erve as a pretence to the people, than with a real de&s;ign of recon|ciliation. The king offered propo&s;als to the commons, which he knew they would not ac|cept; and they, in return, &s;ubmitted nineteen propo&s;itions to his con&s;ideration, which, if complied with, would have rendered him en|tirely &s;ub&s;ervient to their commands. Their import was, that the privy-council, the prin|cipal officers of &s;tate, the governors of the king's children, the commanders of the forts, his fleet, and army, &s;hould be all appointed by, and under the controul of parliament; that papi&s;ts &s;hould be puni&s;hed by their authority; that the church and liturgy &s;hould be reform|ed at their di&s;cretion; and that &s;uch members as had been di&s;placed, &s;hould be re&s;tored. The&s;e propo&s;als, which, if they had been complied with, would have moulded the government in|to an ari&s;tocracy, were, happily for po&s;terity, re|jected by the king.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Should I grant the&s;e de|mands, &s;aid he, in his reply, I might be waited on bare-headed; I might have my hand ki&s;&s;ed, the title of maje&s;ty be continued to me, and the king's authority &s;ignified by both hou&s;es of parliament, might be &s;till the &s;tyle of

your commands; I might have &s;words and maces carried before me, and plea&s;e my&s;elf with the &s;ight of a crown and &s;ceptre (tho' even the&s;e twigs would not long flouri&s;h, when the &s;tock upon which they grew was dead): but as to true and real power, I &s;hould remain but the out&s;ide, but the pic|ture, but the &s;ign of a king."</Q>
War on any terms was, therefore, e&s;teemed preferable to &s;uch an ignominious peace. Thus the king and his parliament mutually reproached each other for beginning a &s;cene of &s;laughter, of which both were equally culpable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. CHARLES I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1642" UNIT="A.D."> NO period &s;ince England began could &s;hew &s;o many in&s;tances of courage, abilities, and virtue, as the pre&s;ent fatal oppo&s;ition called forth into exertion. Now was the time when talents of all kinds, unchecked by authority, were called from the lower ranks of life to di&s;pute for power and pre-eminence. Both &s;ides, equally confident of the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, appealed to God to judge of the recti|tude of their intentions. The parliament was convinced that it fought for heaven, by a&s;&s;erting its regards for a peculiar mode of wor&s;hip; and the king was not le&s;s con|vinced that his claims were &s;acred, as he had ever been taught to con&s;ider them as of divine original. Thus pa&s;&s;ion and enthu&s;ia&s;m on each &s;ide animated the combatants; and courage, rather than conduct among the&s;e un|di&s;ciplined troops, decided the fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Never was conte&s;t more unequal than &s;eem|ed at fir&s;t between the contending parties; the
<PB N="261" REF="263">
king being entirely de&s;titute of every advan|tage. His revenue had been &s;eized by par|liament; all the &s;ea-port towns were in their hands, except Newca&s;tle, and thus they were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the cu&s;toms, which the&s;e could &s;upply; the fleet was at their di&s;po&s;al; all magazines of arms and ammunition were &s;eized for their u&s;e; and they had the wi&s;hes of all the mo&s;t active members of the nation.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e this, the king had that acknow|ledged reverence which was paid to royalty, to give &s;anction to his cau&s;e. The greater part of the nobility adhered to him, as their di&s;tinctions mu&s;t ri&s;e or fall with the &s;ource of honour. Mo&s;t of the men of education al&s;o, and the ancient gentry, &s;till con&s;idered loyalty as a virtue, and armed their tenants and &s;er|vants in his cau&s;e. With the&s;e followers and hopes, therefore, he re&s;olved to take the field, and erected the royal &s;tandard at Nottingham.</P>
<P>Manife&s;toes on the one &s;ide and the other were now di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole kingdom; and the people were univer&s;ally divided between two factions, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The king, to bind him&s;elf by the mo&s;t &s;olemn en|gagements to his people, made the following prote&s;tation before his whole army.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>"I do promi&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of almighty
<PB N="262" REF="264">
God, and as I hope for his ble&s;&s;ing and pro|tection, that I will, to the utmo&s;t of my power, defend and maintain the true re|formed prote&s;tant religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of England; and, by the grace of God, in the &s;ame will live and die.</P><P>I de&s;ire that the laws may be ever the mea&s;ure of my government, and that the liberty and property of the &s;ubject may be pre&s;erved by them with the &s;ame care as my own ju&s;t rights. And if it plea&s;e God by his ble&s;&s;ing on this army, rai&s;ed for my nece&s;&s;ary defence, to pre&s;erve me from the pre&s;ent rebellion, I do &s;olemnly and faith|fully promi&s;e; in the &s;ight of God, to main|tain the ju&s;t privileges and freedom of par|liament, and to govern, to the utmo&s;t of my power, by the known &s;tatutes and cu&s;toms of the kingdom; and particularly to ob&s;erve inviolably the laws to which I have given my con&s;ent this parliament. Mean while, if this emergence, and the great nece&s;&s;ity to which I am driven, beget any violation of law, I hope it &s;hall be imputed by God and man to the authors of this war, not to me, who have &s;o earne&s;tly laboured to pre|&s;erve the peace of the kingdom.</P><P>When I willingly fail in the&s;e particulars, I &s;hall expect no aid or relief from man,
<PB N="263" REF="265">
nor any protection from above. But in this re&s;olution I hope for the chearful a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of all good men, and am confident of the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven."</P></Q>
<P>The &s;incerity with which this &s;peech was delivered, and the ju&s;tice of its contents, &s;erved to &s;trengthen the king's cau&s;e. At fir&s;t he appeared in a very low condition; be&s;ides the train-bands of the county, rai&s;ed by Sir John Digby, the &s;heriff, he had not got together three hundred infantry. His cavalry, which compo&s;ed his chief &s;trength, exceeded not eight hundred, and were very ill provided with arms. However, he was &s;oon gradually reinforced from all quarters; but not being then in a condition to face his enemies, he thought it prudent to retire by &s;low marches to Derby, and thence to Shrew&s;bury, in order to countenance the levies which his friends were making in tho&s;e quarters.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament were not remi&s;s in preparations on their &s;ide. They had a magazine of arms at Hull, and Sir John Hotham was appointed governor of that place by parliament. Charles had &s;ome time before pre&s;ented him&s;elf before that town, but was re|fu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion: and from this they drew their principal re&s;ources. The forces al&s;o, which
<PB N="264" REF="266">
had been every where rai&s;ed on pretence of the &s;ervice of Ireland, were now more openly en|li&s;ted by the parliament for their own pur|po&s;es; and the command given to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, a bold man, who rather de&s;ired to &s;ee monarchy abridged, than totally de&s;troyed. In London, no le&s;s than four thou&s;and men were enli&s;ted in one day; and the parliament voted a declaration, which they required every member to &s;ub&s;cribe, that they would live and die with their general. Orders were al&s;o i&s;&s;ued out for loans of money and plate, which were to defend the king, and both hou&s;es of parlia|ment; for they &s;till pre&s;erved this &s;tyle. This brought immen&s;e quantities of plate to the trea&s;ury; and &s;o great was men's ardour in the cau&s;e, that there was more than they could find room for. By the&s;e means they found them&s;elves in a &s;hort time at the head of &s;ix|teen thou&s;and men; and the earl of E&s;&s;ex led them towards Northampton again&s;t the king.</P>
<P>The army of the royali&s;ts was not &s;o great as that of E&s;&s;ex; however it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be better di&s;ciplined, and better and conducted. The two &s;ons of the unfortunate Elector Pa|latine, prince Rupert and prince Maurice, offered their &s;ervices to the king, and were gladly accepted. A &s;light advantage gained
<PB N="265" REF="267">
by prince Rupert over colonel Sandys, in the beginning, gave great hopes of his future acti|vity, and in&s;pired the army with re&s;olution to hazard a battle. So little were both armies &s;killed in the arts and &s;tratagems of war, that they were within &s;ix miles of each other before they were acquainted with their mutual ap|proach; and, what is remarkable, they had been ten days within twenty miles of each other without knowing it.</P>
<P>Edge-Hill was the fir&s;t place where the two armies were put in array again&s;t each other, and the country fir&s;t drenched in civil &s;laughter. It was a dreadful &s;ight, to &s;ee above thirty thou|&s;and of the brave&s;t men in the world, in&s;tead of employing their courage abroad, turning it again&s;t each other, while the deare&s;t friends, and the neare&s;t kin&s;men, embraced oppo&s;ite &s;ides, and prepared to bury their private re|gards in factious hatred. In the beginning of this engagement, Sir Faithful Forte&s;cue, who had levied a troop for the Iri&s;h war, but had been obliged to &s;erve in the parliamentary ar|my, de&s;erted to the royali&s;ts; and &s;o intimidat|ed the parliamentary forces, that the whole body of cavalry fled. The right wing of their army followed the example; but the victors too eagerly pur&s;uing, E&s;&s;ex's body of re&s;erve
<PB N="266" REF="268">
wheeled upon the rear of the pur&s;uers, and made great havock among them. After the royali&s;ts had a little recovered from their &s;ur|prize, they made a vigorous &s;tand; and both &s;ides, for a time, &s;tood gazing at each other, without &s;ufficient courage to renew the attack. They all night lay under arms, and next morn|ing found them&s;elves in &s;ight of each other; this had been the time for the king to have &s;truck a deci&s;ive blow; he lo&s;t the opportunity, and both &s;ides &s;eparated with equal lo&s;s. Five thou&s;and men are &s;aid to have been found dead on the field of battle.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and no way in&s;tructive, to enter into the marchings, and countermarch|ings of the&s;e undi&s;ciplined and ill conducted armies: war was a new trade to the Engli&s;h, as they had not &s;een an ho&s;tile engagement in the i&s;land for near a century before. The queen came to re-inforce the royal party; &s;he had brought &s;oldiers and ammunition from Holland, and immediately departed to furni&s;h more. But the parliament, who knew its own &s;trength, was no way di&s;couraged. Their de|mands &s;eemed to encrea&s;e in proportion to their lo&s;&s;es; and as they were repre&s;&s;ed in the field, they grew more haughty in the cabinet. Such governors as gave up their fortre&s;&s;es to the king,
<PB N="267" REF="269">
were attainted of high trea&s;on. It was in vain for the king to &s;end propo&s;als after any &s;uc|ce&s;s, this only rai&s;ed their pride and their ani|mo&s;ity. But though this de&s;ire in the king to make peace with his &s;ubjects was the high|e&s;t encomium on his humanity, yet his long negociations, one of which he carried on at Ox|ford, were faulty as a warrior. He wa&s;ted that time in altercation and treaty, which he &s;hould have employed in vigorous exertions in the field.</P>
<P>However, his fir&s;t campaign, upon the whole, wore a favourable a&s;pect. One victory fol|lowed after another; Cornwall was reduced to peace and obedience under the king: a victory was gained over the parliamentarians at Strat|ton Hill, in Devon&s;hire, another at Rounda|way Down, about two miles from the Devizes; and &s;till a third at Chalgrave Field. Bri&s;tol was be&s;ieged and taken; and Glouce&s;ter was be&s;ieged: the battle of Newbury was favour|able to the royal cau&s;e, and great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were formed from an army in the North, rai&s;ed by the marquis of Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But in this campaign, the two brave&s;t and greate&s;t men of their re&s;pective parties were killed; as if it was intended, by the kindne&s;s of Providence, that they &s;hould be exempted from &s;eeing the mi&s;eries and the &s;laughter
<PB N="268" REF="270">
which were &s;hortly to en&s;ue. The&s;e were John Hampden, and Lucius Cary, lord Falk|land.</P>
<P>In an incur&s;ion made by prince Rupert to with in about two miles of the enemies quar|ters, a great booty was obtained. This the parliamentarians attempted to re&s;cue; and Hampden at their head, overtook the royali&s;ts on Chalgrave Field. As he was ever the fir&s;t to enter into the thicke&s;t of the battle, he was &s;hot in the &s;houlder with a brace of bullets, and the bone broke. Some days after, he died in great pain; nor could his whole party, had their army met a total overthrow, have been ca&s;t into greater con&s;ternation. Even Charles his enemy felt for his di&s;a&s;ter, and offered his own &s;urgeon to a&s;&s;i&s;t his cure. Hampden, whom we have &s;een in the beginning of the&s;e troubles refu&s;e to pay &s;hip-money, gained, by his inflexible integrity, the e&s;teem even of his enemies. To the&s;e he added affa|bility in conver&s;ation, temper, art, eloquence in debate, and penetration in coun&s;el.</P>
<P>But Falkland was &s;till a greater lo&s;s, and a greater character. He added to Hamden's &s;e|vere principles, a politene&s;s and elegance, but then beginning to be known in England. He had boldly with&s;tood the king's preten&s;ions,
<PB N="269" REF="271">
while he &s;aw him making a bad u&s;e of his power; but when he perceived the de&s;ign of the parliament, to overturn the religion and the con&s;titution of his country, he changed his &s;ide, and &s;tedfa&s;tly attached him&s;elf to the crown. From the beginning of the civil war, his natural chearfulne&s;s and vivacity for&s;ook him; he became melancholy, &s;ad, pale, and negligent of his per&s;on. When the two ar|mies were in &s;ight of each other, and prepar|ing for the battle of Newbury, he appeared de&s;irous of terminating his life, &s;ince he could not compo&s;e the mi&s;eries of his country. Still anxious for his country alone, he dreaded the too pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s of his own party, as much as that of the enemy; and he pro|fe&s;&s;ed that its mi&s;eries had broken his heart. His u&s;ual cry among his friends, after a deep &s;ilence, and frequent &s;ighs, was Peace! Peace! He now &s;aid, upon the morning of the en|gagement, that he was weary of the times, and &s;hould leave them before night. He was &s;hot by a mu&s;quet-ball in the belly; and his body was next morning found among an heap of &s;lain. His writings, his elegance, his ju&s;tice, and his courage, de&s;erved &s;uch a death of glory: and they found it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="272">The king, that he might make preparations during the winter for the en&s;uing campaign, and to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the We&s;tmin&s;ter parliament, called one at Oxford; and this was the fir&s;t time that England &s;aw two par|liaments &s;itting at the &s;ame time. His hou&s;e of peers was pretty full; his hou&s;e of com|mons con&s;i&s;ted of about an hundred and forty, which amounted to not above half of the other hou&s;e of commons. From this &s;hadow of a parliament he received &s;ome &s;upplies, after which it was prorogued, and never after a&s;|&s;embled.</P>
<P>In the mean time the parliament was equally active on their &s;ide. They pa&s;&s;ed an ordi|nance, commanding all the inhabitants of London and its neighbourhood to retrench a meal a week, and to pay the value of it for the &s;upport of the public cau&s;e. But what was much more effectual, the Scotch, who con&s;idered their claims as &s;imilar, led a &s;trong army to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They levied an army of fourteen thou&s;and men in the ea&s;t, under the earl of Manche&s;ter; they had an army of ten thou&s;and men under E&s;&s;ex, another of nearly the &s;ame force, under Sir William Waller. The&s;e were &s;uperior to any force the king could bring into the field; and were well ap|pointed
<PB N="271" REF="273">
with ammunition, provi&s;ions, and pay.</P>
<P>Ho&s;tilities,<MILESTONE N="1644" UNIT="A.D."> which even during the winter &s;ea&s;on had never been wholly di&s;continued, were renewed in &s;pring with their u&s;ual fury, and &s;erved to de&s;olate the kingdom, without deciding victory. Each county joined that &s;ide to which it was addicted from motives of conviction, intere&s;t, or fear, though &s;ome ob&s;erved a perfect neutrality. Several fre|quently petitioned for peace; and all the wi&s;e and good were earne&s;t in the cry. What par|ticularly de&s;erves remark, was an attempt of the women of London; who, to the number of two or three thou&s;and, went in a body to the hou&s;e of commons, earne&s;tly demanding a peace. <Q REND="inline">"Give us tho&s;e traitors, &s;aid they, that are again&s;t a peace; give them, that we my tear them in pieces."</Q> The guards found &s;ome difficutly in quelling this in&s;urrection, and one or two women lo&s;t their lives in the fray.</P>
<P>The battle of Mar&s;ton-Moor was the be|ginning of the king's misfortunes and di&s;grace. The Scotch and parliamentarian army had join|ed, and were be&s;ieging York; when prince Ru|pert, joined by the marquis of Newca&s;tle, de|termined to rai&s;e the &s;iege. Both &s;ides drew
<PB N="272" REF="274">
up on Mar&s;ton-Moor, to the number of fifty thou&s;and, and the victory &s;eemed long unde|cided between them. Rupert, who command|ed the right wing of the royali&s;ts, was oppo&s;ed by Oliver Cromwell, who now fir&s;t came into notice, at the head of a body of troops, whom he had taken care to levy and di&s;cipline. Crom|well was victorious; he pu&s;hed his opponents off the field, followed the vanqui&s;hed, return|ed to a &s;econd engagement, and a &s;econd vic|tory; the prince's whole train of artillery was taken, and the royali&s;ts never after recovered the blow.</P>
<P>While the king was unfortunate in the field, he was not more &s;ucce&s;sful in negociation. A treaty was begun at Uxbridge, which, like all others, came to nothing. The puritans de|manded a total abolition of the epi&s;copacy, and all church ceremonies; and the&s;e Charles, from conviction, from intere&s;t, and per&s;ua&s;ion, was not willing to permit. He had all along ad|hered to the epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, not only becau&s;e it was favourable to monarchy, but becau&s;e all his adherents were pa&s;&s;ionately de|voted to it. He e&s;teemed bi&s;hops as e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian church; and thought him&s;elf bound, not only by temporal, but &s;acred ties, to defend them. The parliament was as ob|&s;tinately
<PB N="273" REF="275">
bent upon removing this order; and to &s;hew their re&s;olution, began with the fore|mo&s;t of the number.</P>
<P>William Laud, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, as we have already &s;een, had been impri&s;oned in the Tower at the &s;ame time with Strafford; and he had patiently endured &s;o long a con|finement, without being brought to any trial. He was now, therefore, accu&s;ed of high trea|&s;on, in endeavouring to &s;ubvert the fundamen|tal laws, and of other high crimes and mi&s;de|meanors. The groundle&s;s charge of popery, which his life, and afterwards his death belied, was urged again&s;t him. In his defence, he &s;poke &s;everal hours, with that courage which &s;eems the re&s;ult of innocence and integrity. The lords, who were his judges, appeared willing to acquit him; but the commons, his accu&s;ers, finding how his trial was likely to go, pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance for his execution, and terrified the lords who conti|nued ob&s;tinate to give their con&s;ent. Seven peers alone voted in this important que&s;tion; all the re&s;t, either from &s;hame or fear, did not appear. When brought to the &s;caffold, this venerable prelate, without any terror, but in the u&s;ual tone of his exhortations from the pulpit, made the people a long &s;peech. He told them that he had examined his heart;
<PB N="274" REF="276">
and thanked God that he found no &s;ins there, which de&s;erved the death he was going to &s;uf|fer. The king, he &s;aid, had been traduced by &s;ome, as labouring to introduce popery; but he believed him as &s;ound a prote&s;tant as any man in the kingdom; and as for parlia|ments, though he di&s;liked the conduct of one or two, yet he never de&s;igned to change the laws of his country, or the prote&s;tant religion. After he had prayed for a few minutes, the executioner &s;evered his head at a blow. It is indeed a melancholy con&s;ideration, that in the&s;e times of trouble, the be&s;t men were tho&s;e on either &s;ide who chiefly &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The death of Laud was followed by a total alteration of the ceremonies of the church. The Liturgy was, by a public act, aboli&s;hed the day he died, as if he had been the only ob&s;tacle to its former removal. The church of England was in all re&s;pects brought to a conformity to the pu|ritanical e&s;tabli&s;hment; while the citizens of London, and the Scotch army, gave public thanks for &s;o happy an alteration.</P>
<P>The total abolition of the reformed reli|gion, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by queen Elizabeth, &s;eemed at fir&s;t to promi&s;e vigour and con&s;i&s;tence to the coun&s;els of the parliamentarians. But &s;uch is the nature of man, that if he does not
<PB N="275" REF="277">
find, he makes oppo&s;ition. From the moment the puritans began to be apparently united, and ranked under one denomination of pre&s;by|terians, they began again to divide into fre&s;h parties, each profe&s;&s;ing different views and in|tere&s;ts. One part of the hou&s;e was compo&s;ed of Pre&s;byterians, &s;trictly &s;o called; the other, though a minority, of Independents, a new &s;ect that had lately been introduced, and gain|ed ground &s;urpri&s;ingly.</P>
<P>The difference between the&s;e two &s;ects would be hardly worth mentioning, did not their re|ligious opinions influence their political con|duct. The church of England, as we have &s;een, had appointed bi&s;hops of clerical ordi|nation, and a book of common prayer. The pre&s;byterians exclaimed again&s;t both; they were for having the church governed by cler|gymen elected by the people, and prayers made without premeditation. The independents went &s;till farther; they excluded all the clergy, they maintained that every man might pray in public, exhort his audience, and explain the &s;criptures. Their political &s;y&s;tem kept pace with their religious. Not contented with re|ducing the king to a fir&s;t magi&s;trate, which was the aim of the pre&s;byterians, this &s;ect a&s;pired at the abolition not only of all monar|chy,
<PB N="276" REF="278">
but of all &s;ubordination. They main|tained, and they maintained right, that all men were born equal; but they alleged al&s;o, that no accidental or artificial in&s;titutions could de|&s;troy this equality; and there they were de|ceived. Could &s;uch a plan of government as theirs be practicable, it would no doubt be the mo&s;t happy; but the wi&s;e and indu&s;trious mu&s;t in every country prevail over the weak and idle; and the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the inde|pendent &s;cheme &s;oon after &s;hewed how ill adapted &s;uch &s;peculative ideas were to human infirmity. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, with an high idea of their own rectitude, both in religion and politics, they gave way to a &s;urly pride, which is ever the re&s;ult of narrow manners and &s;olitary thinking.</P>
<P>The&s;e were a body of men that were now growing into con&s;ideration; their apparent &s;anctity, their natural courage excited by en|thu&s;ia&s;m, and their uncea&s;ing per&s;everance, began to work con&s;iderable effects; and tho' they were out-numbered in the hou&s;e of com|mons, which was compo&s;ed of more enlight|ened minds, they formed a majority in the army, made up chiefly of the lowe&s;t of the vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="279">The royali&s;ts endeavoured to throw a ridi|cule on this fanatici&s;m, without being &s;en&s;ible how much rea&s;on they had to apprehend its dangerous con&s;equences. The forces of the king were united by much feebler ties; and licence among them, which had been intro|duced by the want of pay, had ari&s;en to a dan|gerous height, rendering them as formidable to their friends as their enemies. To encrea&s;e this unpopularity, the king finding the par|liament of Scotland as well as that of Eng|land declaring again&s;t him, thought proper to make a truce with the papi&s;ts of Ireland, in or|der to bring over the Engli&s;h forces who &s;erved in that kingdom. With the&s;e troops he al&s;o received &s;ome of the native Iri&s;h into his &s;ervice, who &s;till retained their fiercene&s;s and their barbarity. This gave the parliament a plau&s;ible opportunity of upbraiding him with taking papi&s;ts into his &s;ervice, and gave a co|lour to the ancient calumny of his having ex|cited them to rebel. Unfortunately, too &s;oon after it was found, that they rather encrea&s;ed the hatred of his &s;ubjects, than added to the &s;trength of his army. They were routed by Fairfax, one of the generals of the parliament army; and though they threw down their arms they were &s;laughtered without mercy.
<PB N="278" REF="280">
It is &s;aid that &s;everal women were found among the &s;lain, who with long knives had done con|&s;iderable execution; but the animo&s;ity of the Engli&s;h again&s;t the&s;e wretches at that time, might have given ri&s;e to the report.</P>
<P>The&s;e misfortunes were &s;oon after &s;ucceeded by another. Charles, who had now retired to Oxford, found him&s;elf at the head of a tur|bulent &s;editious army, who, from wanting pay, were &s;carcely &s;ubject to control; while, on the other hand, the parliamentarians were well &s;upplied and paid, and held together from principle. The parliament, to give them an example of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in their own con|duct, pa&s;&s;ed an act, called the <HI>Self-denying or|dinance,</HI> which de&s;erved all commendation. They re&s;olved, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted by the nation that their intent was to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters, that no member of their hou&s;e &s;hould have a command in the army. The former generals were therefore changed; the earls of E&s;&s;ex, Denbigh, and Manche&s;ter, gave up their commi&s;&s;ions; and Fairfax, who was now appointed general with Cromwell, who found means to keep at once his &s;eat and his commi&s;&s;ion, new modelled the army. This, which might at fir&s;t have &s;eemed to weaken their forces, gave them new &s;pirit; and the
<PB N="279" REF="281">
&s;oldiers, become more confident in their new commanders, were irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Never was a more &s;ingular army a&s;&s;embled than that which now drew the &s;word in the par|liamentary cau&s;e. The officers exerci&s;ed the office of chaplains; and, during the intervals of action, in&s;tructed their troops by &s;ermons, prayers, and exhortations. Rapturous ec&s;ta|cies &s;upplied the place of &s;tudy and reflection; and while they kindled as they &s;poke, they a&s;cribed their own warmth to a de&s;cent of the &s;pirit from heaven. The private &s;oldiers, &s;eized with the &s;ame &s;pirit, employed their va|cant hours in prayer, in peru&s;ing the holy &s;criptures, in gho&s;tly conferences. When marching to the field of battle, the hymn and the ejaculation, mixed their notes with tho&s;e of the trumpet. An army thus actuated be|came invincible.</P>
<P>The well-di&s;puted battle, which decided the fate of Charles, was fought at Na&s;eby,<MILESTONE N="June 14, 1645."> a vil|lage in York&s;hire. The main body of the royal army was commanded by lord A&s;t|ley, prince Rupert led the right wing, Sir Marmaduke Langdale the left, and the king him&s;elf headed the body of re&s;erve. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, Fairfax and Skippon command|ed the main body; Cromwell led on the right
<PB N="280" REF="282">
wing, and Ireton, his &s;on-in-law, the left. Prince Rupert attacked the left wing with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity and &s;ucce&s;s: they were broke and pur&s;ued as far as the village; but he lo&s;t time in attempting to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their artillery. Cromwell, in the mean time, was equally &s;ucce&s;sful on his &s;ide, and broke through the enemies hor&s;e after a very ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. While the&s;e were thus engaged, the infantry on both &s;ides main|tained the conflict with equal ardour; but in &s;pite of the efforts of Fairfax and Skippon, their battalions began to give way. But it was now that Cromwell returned with his vic|torious forces, and charged the king's infantry in flank with &s;uch vigour, that a total rout began to en&s;ue. By this time prince Rupert had rejoined the king, and the &s;mall body of re&s;erve; but his troops, though victorious, could not be brought to a &s;econd charge. They were at all times licentious and ungo|vernable; but they were now intimidated; for the parliamentarians having recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock, &s;tood ready in order of battle to receive them. The king was de|&s;irous of charging them at the head of his re|&s;erve; but the earl of Carnwarth, who rode by his maje&s;ty's &s;ide, &s;eizing the bridle of his
<PB N="281" REF="283">
hor&s;e, turned him round, &s;aying, with a loud oath,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Will you go upon your death in an in&s;tant."</Q>
The troops &s;eeing this motion, wheeled to the right, and rode off in &s;uch con|fu&s;ion, that they could not be rallied again during the re&s;t of the day. The king per|ceiving the battle wholly lo&s;t, was obliged to abandon the field to his enemies, who took all his cannon, baggage, and above five thou|&s;and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This fatal blow the king never after reco|vered; his army was di&s;per&s;ed, and the con|querors made as many captives as they thought proper. Among the other &s;poils taken on this occa&s;ion, the king's cabinet of letters was &s;eized, in which was contained all his private corre&s;pondence with the queen. The&s;e were &s;hortly after publi&s;hed by the command of the parliament, who took a vulgar and brutal plea|&s;ure in ridiculing all tho&s;e tender effu&s;ions which were never drawn up for the public eye.</P>
<P>The battle of Na&s;eby put the parliament|arians in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t all the &s;trong ci|ties of the kingdom. Bri&s;tol, Bridgewater, Che&s;ter, Sherborn, and Bath. Exeter was be|&s;ieged; and all the king's troops in the we&s;t|ern counties being entirely di&s;per&s;ed, Fairfax pre&s;&s;ed the place, and it &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion.
<PB N="282" REF="284">
The king's intere&s;ts &s;eemed going to ruin on every quarter. The Scotch army, which, as has been &s;aid, took part with the par|liament, having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Carli&s;le after an ob&s;tinate &s;iege, marched &s;outh and laid &s;iege to Hereford. Another en|gagement followed between the king and the parliamentarians, in which his forces were put to the rout by colonel Jones, a thou&s;and of his men made pri&s;oners, and five hundred &s;lain. Thus &s;urrounded, harra&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, he retreated to Oxford, that in all con|ditions of his fortune had held &s;teady to his cau&s;e; and there he re&s;olved to offer new terms to his victorious pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more affecting than the king's &s;ituation during his abode at Oxford. Saddened by his late melancholy di&s;a&s;ters, im|pre&s;&s;ed with the apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch as hung over him, harra&s;&s;ed by the murmurs of tho&s;e who had followed his cau&s;e, and &s;tung with &s;orrow for his incapacity to relieve them. He now was willing to grant the parliament their own terms, and at any rate to procure a reconciliation. He therefore &s;ent them repeated me&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e, but they never deigned to make him the lea&s;t reply. At la&s;t, after reproaching him with the blood &s;pilt dur|ing
<PB N="283" REF="285">
the war, they told him that they were preparing &s;ome bills, to which if he would con&s;ent, they would then be able to judge of his pacific inclinations.</P>
<P>In the mean time Fairfax was approaching with a powerful and victorious army, and was taking the proper mea&s;ures of laying &s;iege to Oxford, which promi&s;ed an ea&s;y &s;urrender. To be taken captive, and led in triumph by his in&s;olent &s;ubjects, was what Charles ju&s;tly abhorred; and every in&s;ult and violence was to be dreaded from the &s;oldiery, who had felt the effects of his oppo&s;ition. In this de&s;pe|rate extremity he embraced a mea&s;ure which, in any other &s;ituation, might ju&s;tly lie under the imputation of imprudence and indi&s;cretion. He re&s;olved to give him&s;elf up to the Scotch army, who had never te&s;tified &s;uch implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t him, and to tru&s;t to their loyalty for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>That he might the better conceal his de&s;ign from the people of Oxford, orders were given at every gate of the city for allowing three per&s;ons to pa&s;s. In the night, the king, ac|companied by one doctor Hud&s;on, and Mr. A&s;hburnham, took the road towards London, travelling as A&s;hburnham's &s;ervant. He, in fact, came &s;o near London, that he once en|tertained
<PB N="284" REF="286">
&s;ome thoughts of entering that city, and of throwing him&s;elf on the mercy of the parliament. At la&s;t, after pa&s;&s;ing through many cro&s;s-roads and bye-ways, he arrived at the Scotch camp before Newark, and di&s;co|vered him&s;elf to lord Leven,<MILESTONE N="Jan. 30, 1646."> the Scotch ge|neral.</P>
<P>The Scotch, who had before given him &s;ome general a&s;&s;urances of their fidelity and protection, now &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at his arrival among them. In&s;tead of be&s;tow|ing a thought on his intere&s;ts, they in&s;tantly entered into a con&s;ultation upon their own. The commi&s;&s;ioners of their army &s;ent up an account of the king's arrival to the parlia|ment, and declared, that his coming was al|together uninvited and unexpected. In the mean time they prevailed upon the king to give directions for &s;urrendering all his garri|&s;ons to the parliament, with which he com|plied. In return for this conde&s;cen&s;ion they treated him with very long &s;ermons among the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and with the mo&s;t cautious re&s;erve, but very different from re&s;pect, among the officers. The preachers of the party in|deed in&s;ulted him from the pulpit; and one of them, after reproaching him to his face with his mi&s;conduct, ordered that p&s;alm to be
<PB N="285" REF="287">
&s;ung, which begins,
<Q><L>"Why do&s;t thou, Tyrant, boa&s;t thy&s;elf</L>
<L>Thy wicked deeds to prai&s;e."</L></Q>
The king &s;tood up, and called for that P&s;alm, which begins with the&s;e words:

The audience accordingly &s;ung this P&s;alm in compa&s;&s;ion to maje&s;ty in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The parliament being informed of the king's captivity, immediately entered into a treaty with the Scotch about delivering up their pri|&s;oner. The Scotch had, from their fir&s;t entrance into England, been allowed pay by the par|liament, in order to prevent their plundering the country; much of this, however, remain|ed unpaid, from the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ities of the times, and much more was claimed by the Scotch than was really due. Neverthe|le&s;s, they now &s;aw this a convenient time for in&s;i&s;ting on their arrears; and they re&s;olved to make the king the in&s;trument by which this money was to be obtained. After various de|bates upon this head between them and the parliament, in which they pretended to great honour, and in&s;i&s;ted upon many punctilios, they agreed, that upon payment of four hun|dred
<PB N="286" REF="288">
thou&s;and pounds they would deliver up the king to his enemies, and this was chear|fully complied with. An action &s;o atrocious may be palliated, but can never be defended; they returned home laden with plunder, and the reproaches of all good men.</P>
<P>From this period, to the de&s;potic govern|ment of Cromwell, the con&s;titution was con|vul&s;ed with all the agitations of faction, guilt, ignorance, and enthu&s;ia&s;m. The kingly power being laid low, the parliament attempted to a&s;&s;ume the rein; but they were &s;oon to &s;ubmit in turn to the military power, which, like all democracies, was turbulent, tran&s;ient, feeble, and bloody.</P>

<P>THE king being delivered over by the Scotch to the parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners, he was conducted under a guard to Holmby Ca&s;|tle, in Northampton&s;hire. They treated him in confinement with the mo&s;t rigorous &s;eve|rity, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all his ancient &s;ervants, debar|ring him from all vi&s;its, and cutting off all communication with his friends and family.</P>
<P>The civil war was now over; the king had ab&s;olved his followers from their allegiance, and the parliament had now no enemy to fear, except tho&s;e very troops by which they had extended their overgrown authority. But in proportion as the terror of the king's power dimini&s;hed, the divi&s;ions between the inde|pendents and the pre&s;byterians became more apparent. The majority in the hou&s;e were of the pre&s;byterian &s;ect; but the majority of the army were &s;taunch independents. At the head of this &s;ect was Cromwell, who &s;ecretly directed its operations, and invigorated all their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">Oliver Cromwell, who&s;e talents now began to appear in full lu&s;tre, was the &s;on of a pri|vate gentleman of Huntingdon; but being the &s;on of a &s;econd brother, he inherited a very &s;mall paternal fortune. He had been &s;ent to Cambridge; but his inclinations not at that time turning to the calm occupations of elegant literature, he was remarkable only for the profligacy of his conduct, and the wa&s;ting his paternal fortune. It was, perhaps, his poverty that induced him to fall into the oppo&s;ite extreme &s;hortly after; for, from being one of the mo&s;t debauched men in the king|dom, he became the mo&s;t rigid and ab&s;temious. The &s;ame vehemence of temper, which had tran&s;ported him into the extremes of plea&s;ure, now di&s;tingui&s;hed his religious habits. He endeavoured to improve his &s;hattered fortunes by agriculture; but this expedient &s;erved only to plunge him in further difficulties. He was even determined to go over and &s;ettle in New England; but was hindered by the king's or|dinance to the contrary. From accident or intrigue, he was cho&s;en member for the town of Cambridge, in the long parliament; but he &s;eemed at fir&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s no talents for oratory, his per&s;on being ungraceful, his dre&s;s &s;lovenly, his elocution homely, tedious, ob&s;cure, and
<PB N="289" REF="291">
embarra&s;&s;ed. He made up, however, by zeal and per&s;everance, what he wanted in natural powers; and being endowed with un&s;haken in|trepidity, much di&s;&s;imulation, and a thorough conviction of the rectitude of his cau&s;e, he ro&s;e, through the gradations of preferment, to the po&s;t of lieutenant-general under Fairfax; but, in reality, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;upreme command over the whole army.</P>
<P>Soon after the retreat of the Scotch, the pre&s;byterian party, &s;eeing every thing reduced to obedience, began to talk of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable part of the army, and to &s;end the re&s;t to Ireland. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that for every rea&s;on the army were as unwil|ling to di&s;band, as to be led over into a coun|try as yet uncivilized, uncultivated, and bar|barous. Cromwell took care to in&s;pire them with an horror of either; they loved him for his bravery and religious zeal, and &s;till more for his &s;eeming affection to them. In&s;tead, therefore, of preparing to di&s;band, they re&s;olv|ed to petition; and they began by de&s;iring an indemnity, ratified by the king, for any illegal actions which they might have commit|ted during the war. This the commons, in turn, treated with great &s;everity; they voted, that this petition tended to introduce mutiny,
<PB N="290" REF="292">
to put conditions upon the parliament, to ob&s;truct the relief of the kingdom of Ireland; and they threatened to proceed again&s;t the promoters of it as enemies to the &s;tate and di&s;turbers of the public peace.</P>
<P>The army now began to con&s;ider them&s;elves as a body di&s;tinct from the commonwealth; and complained, that they had &s;ecured the general tranquility, while they were, at the &s;ame time, deprived of the privileges of Eng|li&s;hmen. In oppo&s;ition, therefore, to the par|liament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, a military parliament was formed, compo&s;ed of the officers and common &s;oldiers of each regiment. The prin|cipal officers formed a council to repre&s;ent the body of peers; the &s;oldiers elected two men out of each company to repre&s;ent the hou&s;e of commons, and the&s;e were called the Agita|tors of the army. Cromwell took care to be one of the number, and thus contrived an ea&s;y method under-hand of conducting and pro|moting the &s;edition of the army.</P>
<P>This fierce a&s;&s;embly having debated for a very &s;hort time, declared, that they found many grievances to be redre&s;&s;ed; and began by &s;pecifying &s;uch as they de&s;ired to be mo&s;t &s;peedily removed. The very &s;ame conduct which had formerly been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s by
<PB N="291" REF="293">
the parliament again&s;t their &s;overeign, was now put in practice by the army again&s;t the par|liament. As the commons granted every re|que&s;t, the agitators ro&s;e in their demands; the&s;e accu&s;ed the army of mutiny and &s;edition; the army retorted the charge, and alledged, that the king had been depo&s;ed only to make way for their u&s;urpations.</P>
<P>The unhappy king, in the mean time, con|tinued a pri&s;oner at Holmby ca&s;tle; and as his countenance might add &s;ome authority to that &s;ide which &s;hould obtain it, Cromwell, who &s;ecretly conducted all the mea&s;ures of the army, while he apparently exclaimed again&s;t their violence, re&s;olved to &s;eize the king's per&s;on. Accordingly a party of five hundred hor&s;e appeared at Holmby ca&s;tle, under the command of one Joyce, who had been originally a taylor; but who, in the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion of all ranks and orders, was advan|ced to the rank of cornet. Without any op|po&s;ition he entered the king's apartment, armed with pi&s;tols, and told him, that he mu&s;t prepare to go with him. Whither? &s;aid the king, To the army, replied Joyce. By what warrant? a&s;ked the king. Joyce pointed to his followers.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your warrant, replied Charles is wrote in fair characters."</Q>
And then
<PB N="292" REF="294">
without further delay he went into his coach, and was &s;afely conducted to the army who were ha&s;tening to their rendezvous at Triplo|heath, near Cambridge. The next day Crom|well arrived among them, where he was receiv|ed with acclamations of joy, and was in&s;tantly inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command.</P>
<P>It was now that the commons perceived a &s;ettled de&s;ign in the army to pre&s;cribe laws to their employers; and they did not fail to &s;pread the alarm through the city. But it was too late to re&s;i&s;t; the army, with Cromwell at their head, advanced with precipitation, and arrived in a few days at St Alban's; &s;o that the commons now began to think of tempo|rizing. The declaration, by which they had voted the military petitioners enemies to the &s;tate, was recalled, and erazed from their journal book. But all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was be|come vain; the army &s;till ro&s;e in their de|mands, in proportion as tho&s;e demands were gratified, until at la&s;t they entirely threw off the ma&s;k, and claimed a right of modelling the whole government, and &s;ettling the na|tion.</P>
<P>But as too precipitate an a&s;&s;umption of au|thority might appear invidious, Cromwell be|gan
<PB N="293" REF="295">
by accu&s;ing eleven members of the hou&s;e as guilty of high trea&s;on, and enemies to the army. The members accu&s;ed were the very leaders of the pre&s;byterian party, the very men who had pre&s;cribed &s;uch rigorous mea&s;ures to the king, and now, in their turn, were threa|tened with popular re&s;entment. As they were the leading men in the hou&s;e, the commons were willing to protect them; but the army in&s;i&s;ting on their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, they voluntarily left the hou&s;e, rather than be compelled to withdraw.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the citizens of London, who had been ever foremo&s;t in &s;edition, began to open their eyes, and to perceive that the con&s;titution was totally overturned. They &s;aw an oppre&s;|&s;ive parliament now &s;ubjected to a more op|pre&s;&s;ive army; they found their religion abo|li&s;hed, their king a captive, and no hopes of redre&s;s but from another &s;cene of &s;laughter. In this exigence, therefore, the common-coun|cil a&s;&s;embled the militia of the city; the works were manned, and a manife&s;to publi&s;hed, ag|gravating the ho&s;tile intentions of the army. Finding that the hou&s;e of commons, in com|pliance with the reque&s;t of the army, had voted that the city militia &s;hould be di&s;banded, the multitude ro&s;e, be&s;ieged the door of the
<PB N="294" REF="296">
hou&s;e, and obliged them to rever&s;e that vote which they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o lately.</P>
<P>In this manner was this wretched hou&s;e in|timidated on either &s;ide, obliged at one time to obey the army, at another, to comply with the clamours of the city rabble. This a&s;&s;embly was, in con&s;equence, divided into parties, as u&s;ual, one part &s;iding with the &s;editious citi|zens; while the minority, with the two &s;peakers at their head, were for encouraging the army. In &s;uch an univer&s;al confu&s;ion, it is not to be ex|pected that any thing le&s;s than a &s;eparation of the parties could take place; and accord|ingly the two &s;peakers, with &s;ixty two mem|bers, &s;ecretly retired from the hou&s;e, and threw them&s;elves under the protection of the army, that were then at Houn&s;low-heath. They were received with &s;houts and acclamations, their integrity was extolled, and the whole body of the &s;oldiery, a formidable force of twenty-thou&s;and men, now moved forward to rein|&s;tate them in their former &s;eats and &s;tations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that part of the hou&s;e that was left behind, re&s;olved to act with vigour, and re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of the army. They cho&s;e new &s;peakers, they gave orders for enli&s;ting troops, they ordered the train|bands to man the lines; and the whole city,
<PB N="295" REF="297">
boldly re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t the inva&s;ion. But this re&s;olution only held while the enemy was thought at a di&s;tance, for when the formida|ble force of Cromwell appeared, all was obe|dience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; the gates were opened to the general, who attended the two &s;peakers, and the re&s;t of the members, peaceably to their habitations. The eleven impeached members, being accu&s;ed as cau&s;es of the tumult, were expelled, and mo&s;t of them retired to the con|tinent. The mayor, &s;heriff, and three alder|men, were &s;ent to the Tower; &s;everal citizens, and officers of militia, were committed to pri|&s;on, and the lines about the city were levelled to the ground. The command of the Tower was given to Fairfax, the general; and the par|liament ordered him their hearty thanks for having di&s;obeyed their commands.</P>
<P>It now only remained to di&s;po&s;e of the king, who had been &s;ent by the army a pri&s;oner to Hampton-Court. The independent army, at the head of whom was Cromwell, on one hand; and the pre&s;byterians in the name of either hou&s;e, on the other hand, treated &s;eparately with him in private. He had at one time even hopes, that in the&s;e &s;truggles for power, he might have been cho&s;en mediator in the di&s;|pute; and he expected that the kingdom, at
<PB N="296" REF="298">
la&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of anarchy, would, like a froward child, hu&s;hed with its own im|portunities, &s;ettle into its former tranquil con|&s;titution. However, in all his mi&s;eries and doubts, though at fir&s;t led about with the army, and afterwards kept a pri&s;oner by them at Hampton, &s;uch was his admirable equality of temper, that no difference was perceived in his countenance and behaviour. Though a captive in the hands of his mo&s;t inveterate enemies, he &s;till &s;upported the dignity of a monarch; and he never one moment &s;unk from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;uperio|rity.</P>
<P>It is true, that at fir&s;t he was treated with &s;ome flattering marks of di&s;tinction; he was permitted to conver&s;e with his old &s;ervants, his chaplains were admitted to attend him, and celebrate divine &s;ervice their own way. But the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure he enjoyed was in the company of his children, with whom he had &s;everal interviews. The meet|ing on the&s;e occa&s;ions was &s;o pathetic, that Cromwell him&s;elf, who was once pre&s;ent, could not help being moved; he was heard to declare, that he had never beheld &s;uch an affecting &s;cene before; and we mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to this man's feelings, as he was him&s;elf a tenderfather.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="299">But tho&s;e flattering in&s;tances of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion were of no long continuance. As &s;oon as the army had gained a complete victory over the hou&s;e of commons, the independents began to abate of their expre&s;&s;ions of duty and re|&s;pect. The king therefore was now more &s;trictly guarded: they would hardly allow his dome&s;tics to conver&s;e with him in private, and &s;pies were employed to mark all his words and actions. He was every hour threatened with fal&s;e dangers of Cromwell's contrivance; by which he was taught to fear for his per&s;onal &s;afety. The &s;pies and creatures of that cunning man, were &s;edulou&s;ly employed in rai&s;ing the king's terrors, and repre&s;enting to him the danger of his &s;ituation. The&s;e, therefore, at length pre|vailed, and Charles re&s;olved to withdraw him|&s;elf from the army. Cromwell con&s;idered, that if he &s;hould e&s;cape the kingdom, there would be then a theatre open to his ambition; if he &s;hould be apprehended, the late attempt would aggravate his guilt, and apologize for any &s;ucceeding &s;everity.</P>
<P>Early in the evening the king retired to his chamber, on pretence of being indi&s;po&s;ed; and about an hour after midnight, he went down the back-&s;tairs, attended by A&s;hburn|ham and Legg, both gentlemen of his bed|chamber.
<PB N="298" REF="300">
Sir John Berkeley waited for him at the garden-gate with hor&s;es, which they in|&s;tantly mounted, and travelling through the Fore&s;t all night, arrived at Tichfield, the &s;eat of the earl of Southampton. Before he arrived at this place, had gone towards the &s;hore, and expre&s;&s;ed great anxiety that a &s;hip, which A&s;h|burnham had promi&s;ed to be in readine&s;s, was not to be &s;een. At Tichfield he deliberated with his friends upon his next excur&s;ion, and they advi&s;ed him to cro&s;s over to the I&s;le of Wight, where Hammond was governor; who, though a creature of Cromwell's, was yet a nephew of one doctor Hammond, the king's chaplain. To this inau&s;picious protector it was re&s;olved to have recour&s;e; A&s;hburnham and Berkeley were &s;ent before to exact a pro|mi&s;e from this officer, that if he would not protect the king, he would not detain him. Hammond &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at their demand; expre&s;&s;ed his inclination to &s;erve his maje&s;ty, but at the &s;ame time alledged his duty to his employers. He therefore attended the king's gentlemen to Tichfield, with a guard of &s;ol|diers, and &s;taid in a lower apartment while A&s;hburnham went up to the king's chamber. Charles no &s;ooner under&s;tood that Hammond was in the hou&s;e with a body of troops, than
<PB N="299" REF="301">
he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O Jack! thou ha&s;t undone me!"</Q> A&s;hburnham &s;hed a flood of tears, and offered to go down and di&s;patch the governor, but the king repre&s;&s;ed his ardour. When Ham|mond came into his pre&s;ence, he repeated his profe&s;&s;ions of regard; Charles &s;ubmitted to his fate; and, without further delay, attended him to Cari&s;brook ca&s;tle, in the I&s;le of Wight, where at fir&s;t he found him&s;elf treated with marks of duty and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>While the king continued in this forlorn &s;ituation, the parliament, new modelled as it was by the army, was every day growing more feeble and factious. Cromwell, on the other hand, was &s;trengthening the army, and taking every precaution to repre&s;s any tendency to factious divi&s;ion among them. Nor were his fears without ju&s;t cau&s;e; for had it not been for the quickne&s;s of his penetration, and the boldne&s;s of his activity, the whole army would have been thrown into a &s;tate of ungovernable frenzy.</P>
<P>Among the independents, who, in general, were for having no eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ubordination, a &s;et of men grew up called <HI>Levellers,</HI> who di&s;|allowed all &s;ubordination what&s;oever, and de|clared that they would have no other chap|lain, king, or general, but Chri&s;t. They de|clared
<PB N="300" REF="302">
that all men were equal; that all de|grees and ranks &s;hould be levelled, and an exact partition of property e&s;tabli&s;hed in the nation. This ferment &s;pread through the army; and as it was a doctrine well &s;uited to the poverty of the daring &s;oldiery, it promi&s;ed every day to become more dangerous and fatal. Several petitions were pre&s;ented, urging the ju&s;tice of a partition, and threatening vengeance in ca&s;e of refu&s;ing redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Cromwell now &s;aw that he was upon the point of lo&s;ing all the fruits of his former &s;chemes and dangers, and dreaded this new faction &s;till more, as they turned his own pre|tended principles again&s;t him&s;elf. Thus find|ing all at &s;take, he re&s;olved, by one re&s;olute blow, to di&s;per&s;e the faction, or peri&s;h in the attempt. Having intimation that the levellers were to meet at a certain place, be unexpected|ly appeared before the terrified a&s;&s;embly, at the head of his red regiment, which had been hi|therto invincible. He demanded, in the name of God, what the&s;e meetings and murmurings meant; he expo&s;tulated with them upon the danger and con&s;equence of their precipitate &s;chemes, and de&s;ired them immediately to de|part. But in&s;tead of obeying, they returned an in&s;olent an&s;wer; wherefore, ru&s;hing on them
<PB N="301" REF="303">
in a fury, he laid, with his own hands, two of them dead at his feet. His guards di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t, he cau&s;ed &s;everal of them to be hang|ed upon the &s;pot, he &s;ent others pri&s;oners to London; and thus di&s;&s;ipated a faction, no otherwi&s;e criminal than in having followed his own example.</P>
<P>This action &s;erved &s;till more to encrea&s;e the power of Cromwell in the camp, and in the parliament; and while Fairfax was nominally general of the troops, he was inve&s;ted with all the power. But his authority &s;oon became irre&s;i&s;tible, in con&s;equence of a new and unex|pected addition to his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The Scotch, perhaps a&s;hamed of the reproach of having &s;old their king, and &s;timulated farther by the independents, who took all occa&s;ions to mor|tify them, rai&s;ed an army in his favour, and the chief command was given to the earl of Ha|milton; while Langdale, who profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf at the head of the more bigotted party, who had taken the covenant, marched at the head of his &s;eparate body, and both invaded the North of England. Their two armies amounted to above twenty thou&s;and men. But Cromwell, at the head of eight thou&s;and of his hardy veterans, feared not to give them battle; he attacked them one after the other,
<PB N="302" REF="304">
routed and di&s;per&s;ed them, took Hamilton pri&s;oner; and, following his blow, entered Scot|land, where he &s;ettled the government entirely to his &s;atisfaction. An in&s;urrection in Kent, was quelled by Fairfax, at the &s;ame time with the &s;ame ea&s;e; and nothing but &s;ucce&s;s attend|ed all this bold u&s;urper's criminal attempts.</P>
<P>During the&s;e contentions, the king, who was kept a pri&s;oner at Cari&s;brook, continued to negociate with the parliament for &s;ettling the un&s;peakable calamities of the kingdom. The parliament &s;aw no other method of de&s;troying the military power, but to depre&s;s it by the kingly. Frequent propo&s;als for an accommo|dation pa&s;&s;ed between the captive king and the commons; but the great ob&s;tacle which had all along &s;tood in the way, &s;till kept them from agreeing. This was the king's refu&s;ing to abo|li&s;h epi&s;copacy, though he con&s;ented to de|&s;troy the liturgy of the church. However, the treaty was &s;till carried on with vigour, as the parliament had more to apprehend from the de&s;igns of their generals, than from the attempts of the king; and, for the fir&s;t time, they &s;eemed in earne&s;t to conclude their nego|ciations.</P>
<P>But all was now too late; their power was &s;oon totally to expire, for the rebellious army,
<PB N="303" REF="305">
crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, was returned from the de&s;truction of their enemies; and, &s;en&s;ible of their own power, with furious remon&s;trances be|gan to demand vengeance on the king. At the &s;ame time they advanced to Wind&s;or; and &s;end|ing an officer to &s;eize the king's per&s;on, where he was lately &s;ent under confinement, they con|veyed him to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, in Hamp&s;hire, op|po&s;ite the I&s;le of Wight. It was in vain that the parliament complained of this har&s;h proceeding, as being contrary to their approbation; it was in vain that they began to i&s;&s;ue ordinances for a more effectual oppo&s;ition; they received a me&s;&s;age from Cromwell, that he intended pay|nig them a vi&s;it the next day with his army; and in the mean time, ordered them to rai&s;e him forty thou&s;and pounds upon the city of London.</P>
<P>The commons, however, though de&s;titute of all hopes of prevailing, had &s;till courage to re&s;i&s;t, and attempted, in the face of the whole army, to clo&s;e their treaty with the king. They had taken into con&s;ideration the whole of his conce&s;&s;ions; and though they had for|merly voted them un&s;atisfactory, they now renewed the con&s;ultation with fre&s;h vigour. After a violent debate, which had la&s;ted three days, it was carried in the king's favour by a
<PB N="304" REF="306">
majority of an hundred and twenty-nine again&s;t eighty-three, that his conce&s;&s;ions were a foun|dation for the hou&s;es to proceed upon in the &s;ettlement of the kingdom. This was the la&s;t attempt in his favour; for the next day Co|lonel Pride, at the head of two regiments, blockaded the hou&s;e, and &s;eized in the pa&s;&s;age forty-one members of the pre&s;byterian party; and &s;ent them to a low room belonging to the hou&s;e, that pa&s;&s;ed by the denomination of Hell. Above an hundred and &s;ixty mem|bers more were excluded: and none were allowed to enter but the mo&s;t furious and determined of the independents, in all not exceeding &s;ixty. This atrocious inva&s;ion of the parliamentary rights, commonly pa&s;&s;ed by the name of Pride's purge, and the remain|ing members were called the Rump. The&s;e &s;oon voted, that the tran&s;actions of the hou&s;e a few days before were entirely illegal, and that their general's conduct was ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained after the con&s;titution had been de&s;troyed, after the parliament had been ejected, after the religion of the country had been aboli&s;hed, after the brave&s;t and the be&s;t of its &s;ubjects had been &s;lain, but to mur|der the king! This vile parliament, if it now de&s;erves the name, was compo&s;ed of a medley

of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure citizens, and the officers of the army. In this a&s;&s;embly, therefore, a committee was appointed to bring in a charge again&s;t the king; and, on their report, a vote pa&s;&s;ed, declaring it trea&s;on in a king to levy war again&s;t his parliament. It was therefore re&s;olved that an High Court of Ju&s;tice &s;hould be appointed to try his maje&s;ty for this new|invented trea&s;on. For form &s;ake they de&s;ired the concurrence of the few remaining lords in the other hou&s;e; but here there was virtue enough left unanimou&s;ly to reject the horrid propo&s;al.</P>
<P>But the commons were not to be &s;topped by &s;o &s;mall an ob&s;tacle. They voted, that the concurrence of the hou&s;e of lords was unne|ce&s;&s;ary; they voted, that the people were the origin of all ju&s;t power, a fact which, though true, they could never bring home to them|&s;elves. To add to their zeal, a woman of Hereford&s;hire, illuminated by prophetical vi|&s;ions, de&s;ired admittance, and communicated a revelation which &s;he had received from hea|ven. She a&s;&s;ured them that their mea&s;ures were con&s;ecrated from above, and ratified by the &s;anction of the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P><PB N="306" REF="308">Colonel Harri&s;on, the &s;on of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the king from Hur&s;t ca&s;tle to Wind&s;or, and from thence to London. His afflicted &s;ubjects, who ran to have a &s;ight of their &s;overeign, were greatly affected at the change that appeared in his face and per&s;on. He had allowed his beard to grow; his hair was become venerably grey, rather by the pre&s;&s;ure of anxiety than the hand of time; while the re&s;t of his apparel bore the marks of misfortune and decay. Thus he &s;tood a &s;olitary figure of maje&s;ty in di&s;tre&s;s, which even his adver&s;aries could not behold without reverence and compa&s;&s;ion. He had been long attended only by an old decrepid &s;ervant, who&s;e name was Sir Philip Warwick, who could only deplore his ma&s;ter's fate, without being able to revenge his cau&s;e. All the exterior &s;ymbols of &s;overeignty were now withdrawn; and his new attendants had orders to &s;erve him without ceremony. The duke of Hamilton, who was re&s;erved for the &s;ame pu|ni&s;hment with his ma&s;ter, having leave to take a la&s;t farewell as he departed from Wind&s;or, threw him&s;elf at the king's feet crying out, <Q REND="inline">"My dear ma&s;ter."</Q> The unhappy monarch rai&s;ed him up, and embracing him tenderly, replied, while the tears ran down his cheeks,
<PB N="307" REF="309">
<Q REND="inline">"I have indeed been a dear ma&s;ter to you."</Q> The&s;e were &s;evere di&s;tre&s;&s;es; however, he could not be per&s;uaded that his adver&s;aries would bring him to a formal trial; but he every moment expected to be di&s;patched by private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>From the &s;ixth, to the twentieth of January, was &s;pent in making preparations for his ex|traordinary trial. The court of ju&s;tice con|&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and thirty-three per&s;ons named by the commons; but of the&s;e never above &s;eventy met upon the trial. The members were chiefly compo&s;ed of the chief officers of the army, mo&s;t of them of very mean birth, together with &s;ome of the lower hou&s;e, and a few citizens of London. Brad&s;haw, a law|yer, was cho&s;en pre&s;ident, Coke was appointed &s;ollicitor for the people of England, Dori&s;laus, Steele and A&s;ke, were named a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The court &s;at in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</P>
<P>The king was now conducted from Wind|&s;or to St. James's, and the next day was brought before the high court to take his trial. While the crier was calling over the names of the commi&s;&s;ioners for trying him, no body an&s;wering for lord Fairfax, a female voice from the gallery was heard to cry out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He has more wit than to be here."</Q>
When
<PB N="308" REF="310">
the impeachment was read in the name of the people of England, the &s;ame voice exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, nor a tenth part of them."</Q> Axtel, the officer who guarded the court, giving orders to fire into the box from whence the voice proceeded, it was di&s;covered that the&s;e bold an&s;wers came from the lady Fairfax, who alone had courage to condemn their proceed|ings.</P>
<P>When the king was brought forward before the court, he was conducted by the mace|bearer to a chair placed within the bar. Tho' long detained a pri&s;oner, and now produced as a criminal, he &s;till &s;u&s;tained the dignity of a king; he &s;urveyed the members of the court with a &s;tern haughty air, and, without moving his hat, &s;at down, while the members al&s;o were covered. His charge was then read by the &s;ollicitor, accu&s;ing him of having been the cau&s;e of all the blood&s;hed which followed &s;ince the commencement of the war; at that part of the charge he could not &s;uppre&s;s a &s;mile of con|tempt and indignation. After the charge was fini&s;hed, Brad&s;haw directed his di&s;cour&s;e to the king, and told him, that the court ex|pected his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The king with great temper entered upon his defence, by declining the authority of the
<PB N="309" REF="311">
court. He repre&s;ented, that having been en|gaged in treaty with his two hou&s;es of parlia|ment, and having fini&s;hed almo&s;t every article, he expected a different treatment from that he now received. He perceived, he &s;aid, no ap|pearance of an upper hou&s;e, which was nece&s;|&s;ary to con&s;titute a ju&s;t tribunal. That he was him&s;elf the king and fountain of law, and con|&s;equently could not be tried by laws to which he had never given his a&s;&s;ent; that having been entru&s;ted with the liberties of the people, he would not now betray them, by recogniz|ing a power founded in u&s;urpation; that he was willing before a proper tribunal to enter into the particulars of his defence; but that before them he mu&s;t decline any apology for his innocence, le&s;t he &s;hould be con&s;idered as the betrayer of, and not a martyr for the con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Brad&s;haw, in order to &s;upport the authority of the court, in&s;i&s;ted, that they had received their power from the people, the &s;ource of all right. He pre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner not to decline the authority of the court, that was delegated by the commons of England, and interrupted, and over-ruled the king in his attempts to reply.</P>
<P>In this manner the king was three times pro|duced before the court, and as often per&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="310" REF="312">
in declining its juri&s;diction. The fourth and la&s;t time he was brought before this &s;elf-creat|ed court, as he was proceeding thither, he was in&s;ulted by the &s;oldiers and the mob, who exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;tice! ju&s;tice! execution! exe|cution!"</Q> but he continued undaunted. His judges having now examined &s;ome witne&s;|&s;es, by whom it was proved that the king had appeared in arms again&s;t the forces commi&s;|&s;ioned by parliament, they pronounced &s;en|tence again&s;t him. He &s;eemed very anxious at this time to be admitted to a conference with the two hou&s;es; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that he intended to re&s;ign the crown to his &s;on; but the court refu&s;ed compliance, and con&s;i|dered his reque&s;t as an artifice to delay ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The conduct of the king under all the&s;e in|&s;tances of low-bred malice was great, firm, and equal; in going through the hall from this execrable tribunal, the &s;oldiers and rabble were again in&s;tigated to cry out ju&s;tice and execu|tion. They reviled him with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. Among other in&s;ults, one mi&s;|creant pre&s;umed to &s;pit in the face of his &s;o|vereign. He patiently bore their in&s;olence.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poor &s;ouls, cried he, they would treat their generals in the &s;ame manner for &s;ix pence."</Q>
Tho&s;e of the populace, who &s;till retained the
<PB N="311" REF="313">
feelings of humanity, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow in &s;ighs and tears. A &s;oldier more compa&s;|&s;ionate than the re&s;t, could not help imploring a ble&s;&s;ing upon his royal head. An officer overhearing him, &s;truck the hone&s;t centinel to the ground before the king, who could not help &s;aying, that the puni&s;hment exceeded the offence.</P>
<P>At his return to Whitehall, he de&s;ired the permi&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e to &s;ee his children, and to be attended in his private devotions by doctor Juxon, late bi&s;hop of London. The&s;e reque&s;ts were granted, and al&s;o three days to prepare for the execution of the &s;entence. All that remained of his family now in England were the prince&s;s Elizabeth, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, a child of about three years of age. After many &s;ea&s;onable and &s;en&s;ible ex|hortations to his daughter, he took his little &s;on in his arms, and embracing him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My child, &s;aid he, they will cut off thy father's head, yes they will cut off my head, and make thee a king. But mark what I &s;ay; thou mu&s;t not be a king as long as thy brothers Charles and James are alive. They will cut off their heads when they can take them, and thy head too they will cut off at la&s;t, and therefore I charge thee do not be
<PB N="312" REF="314">
made a king by them."</Q>
The child, bur&s;t|ing into tears, replied,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will be torn in pieces fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Every night during the interval between his &s;entence and execution, the king &s;lept &s;ound as u&s;ual, though the noi&s;e of the workmen, employed in framing the &s;caffold, continually re&s;ounded in his ears. The fatal morning being at la&s;t arrived, he ro&s;e early; and calling one of his attendants, he bad him employ more than u&s;ual care in dre&s;&s;ing him, and preparing him for &s;o great and joyful a &s;olemnity. The &s;treet before Whitehall was the place de&s;tined for his execution; for it was intended that this would encrea&s;e the &s;everity of his puni&s;hment. He was led through the Banquetting Hou&s;e to the &s;caffold adjoining to that edifice, at|tended by his friend and &s;ervant bi&s;hop Juxon, a man endowed with the &s;ame mild and &s;teady virtues with his ma&s;ter. The &s;caffold, which was covered with black, was guarded by a regiment of &s;oldiers, under the command of colonel Tomlin&s;on, and on it were to be &s;een the block, the ax, and two executioners in ma&s;ques. The people in great crowds &s;tood at a greater di&s;|tance, in dreadful expectation of the event. The king &s;urveyed all the&s;e &s;olemn prepara|tions with calm compo&s;ure; and as he could
<PB N="313" REF="315">
not expect to be heard by the people at a di&s;|tance, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the few per&s;ons who &s;tood round him. He there ju&s;tified his own innocence in the late fatal wars; and ob|&s;erved, that he had not taken arms till after the parliament, had &s;hewn him the example. That he had no other object in his warlike preparations than to pre&s;erve that authority en|tire, which had been tran&s;mitted to him by his ance&s;tors: but, though innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity of his execution in the eyes of his Maker. He owned that he was ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for having con&s;ented to the execution of an unju&s;t &s;en|tence upon the earl of Strafford. He forgave all his enemies, exhorted the people to return to their obedience, and acknowledge his &s;on as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and &s;ignified his attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, as profe&s;&s;ed in the church of England. So &s;trong was the impre&s;|&s;ion his dying words made upon the few who could hear him, that colonel Tomlin&s;on him&s;elf, to who&s;e care he had been committed, acknowleged him&s;elf a convert.</P>
<P>While he was preparing him&s;elf for the block, bi&s;hop Juxon called out to him:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is, Sir, but one &s;tage more, which, though turbulent and trouble&s;ome, is yet a
<PB N="314" REF="316">
very &s;hort one. It will &s;oon carry you a great way. It will carry you from earth to heaven, and there you &s;hall find, to your great joy, the prize to which you ha&s;ten, a crown of glory."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I go, replied the king, from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no di&s;turbance can have place."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You exchange, replied the bi&s;hop, a temporal for an eternal crown, a good exchange."</Q>
Charles having taken off his cloak delivered his George to the prelate, pronouncing the word <Q REND="inline">"Remember."</Q> Then he laid his neck on the block, and &s;tretching out his hands as a &s;ignal, one of the executioners &s;evered his head from his body at a blow, while the other, holding it up, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is the head of a traitor."</Q>
The &s;pectators te&s;tified their horror at that &s;ad &s;pectacle in &s;ighs, tears, and lamentations; the tide of their duty and af|fection began to return, and each blamed him|&s;elf either with active di&s;loyalty to his king, or a pa&s;&s;ive compliance with his de&s;troyers. The very pulpits, that u&s;ed to re&s;ound with in&s;o|lence and &s;edition, were now bedewed with tears of unfeigned repentance; and all united in their dete&s;tation of tho&s;e dark hypocrites, who, to &s;atisfy their own enmity, involved a whole nation in the guilt of trea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317">Charles was executed in the forty-ninth year of his age,<MILESTONE N="Jan. 30, 1649."> and the twenty-fourth of his reign. He was of a middling &s;tature, robu&s;t, and well proportioned. His vi&s;age was plea&s;|ing, but melancholy; and it is probable that the continual troubles in which he was in|volved might have made that impre&s;&s;ion on his countenance. As for his character, the reader will deduce it with more preci&s;ion and &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf from the detail of his conduct, than from any &s;ummary given of it by the hi&s;torian. It will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that all his faults &s;eem to have ari&s;en from the error of his education; while all his virtues, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many, were the genuine offspring of his heart. He lived at a time when the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution was at variance with the genius of the people; and governing by old rules and precedents, in&s;tead of accommodat|ing him&s;elf to the changes of the times, he fell, and drew down as he &s;unk the con&s;titu|tion in ruins round him. Many kings before him expired by trea&s;ons or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; but never &s;ince the times of Agis the Lacedemo|nian was there any other &s;acrificed by his &s;ub|jects with all the formalities of ju&s;tice. Many were the mi&s;eries &s;u&s;tained by the nation in bringing this monarch to the block, and more

were yet to be endured previous to the &s;ettle|ment of the con&s;titution; yet the&s;e &s;truggles in the end were productive of dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s and &s;ecurity, the laws became more preci&s;e, the monarch's privileges better a&s;cer|tained, and the &s;ubjects duty better delineated; all became more peaceable, as if a previous fermentation in the con&s;titution was nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ub&s;equent refinement.</P>

<P>CROMWELL,<MILESTONE N="1649" UNIT="A.D."> who had &s;ecretly &s;olli|cited, and contrived the king's death, now began to feel wi&s;hes to which he had been hi|therto a &s;tranger. His pro&s;pects widening as he ro&s;e, his fir&s;t principles of liberty were all lo&s;t in the unbounded &s;tretch of power that lay before him. When the peers met on the day appointed in their adjournment, they en|tered
<PB N="318" REF="320">
upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ent down &s;ome votes to the commons, of which the latter deigned not to take the lea&s;t notice. In a few days af|ter the commons voted, that the hou&s;e of lords was u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous, and therefore was to be aboli&s;hed. They voted it high trea&s;on to acknowledge Charles Stuart, &s;on of the late king, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne. A great &s;eal was made, on one &s;ide of which were engra|ven the arms of England and Ireland, with this in&s;cription:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The great &s;eal of Eng|land."</Q>
On the rever&s;e was repre&s;ented the hou&s;e of commons &s;itting, with this motto:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On the fir&s;t year of freedom, by God's ble&s;&s;ing re&s;tored, 1648."</Q>
The forms of all public bu&s;ine&s;s were changed from the king's name, to that of the keepers of the liberties of England.</P>
<P>The next day they proceeded to try tho&s;e gallant men, who&s;e attachment to their late &s;overeign had been the mo&s;t remarkable. The duke of Hamilton and lord Capel were con|demned and executed, the earl of Holland lo&s;t his life by a like &s;entence, the earl of Nor|wich and Sir John Owen were condemned, but afterwards pardoned by the commons.</P>
<P>The Scotch, who had in the beginning &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o aver&s;e to the royal family,
<PB N="319" REF="321">
and having, by a long train of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, to|tally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all in&s;urrections in its favour, now fir&s;t began to relent from their various per&s;ecutions. Their loyalty began to return; and the in&s;olence of the independents, with their victories, &s;erved to enflame them &s;till more. The execution of their favourite duke Hamilton al&s;o, who was put to death not only contrary to the laws of war, but of nations, was no &s;mall vexation; they, therefore, deter|mined to acknowlege prince Charles for their king. But their love of liberty was &s;till pre|dominant, and &s;eemed to combat with their manifold re&s;entments. At the &s;ame time that they re&s;olved upon rai&s;ing him to the throne, they abridged his power with every limitation which they had attempted to impo&s;e on their late &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Charles, after the death of his father, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Paris, and finding no likelihood of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter, was glad to accept of any conditions. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the virtues nor the con&s;tancy of his father; and being attached to no religion as yet, he agreed to all their propo&s;als, being &s;atis|fied with even the formalities of royalty. It is remarkable, that while the Scotch were thus inviting their king over, they were, neverthe|le&s;s,
<PB N="320" REF="322">
cruelly puni&s;hing tho&s;e who had adhered to his cau&s;e. Among others, the earl of Mon|tro&s;e, one of the brave&s;t, polite&s;t, and mo&s;t fini&s;hed characters of that age, was taken pri|&s;oner, as he endeavoured to rai&s;e the High|landers in the royal cau&s;e; and being brought to Edinburgh was hanged on a gibbet thirty feet high, then quartered, and his limbs &s;tuck up in the principal towns of the kingdom. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this &s;everity to his fol|lowers, Charles ventured into Scotland, and had the mortification to enter the gate of Edin|burgh, where the limbs of that faithful adhe|rent were &s;till expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Being now entirely at the mercy of the gloomy and au&s;tere zealots, who had been the cau&s;e of his father's misfortunes, he &s;oon found that he had only exchanged exile for impri&s;onment. He was &s;urrounded, and in|ce&s;&s;antly importuned by the fanatical clergy, who obtruded their religious in&s;tructions, and obliged him to li&s;ten to long &s;ermons, in which they &s;eldom failed to &s;tigmatize the late king as a tyrant, to accu&s;e his mother of idolatry, and him&s;elf of an untoward di&s;po&s;ition. Six &s;er|mons a day were his u&s;ual allowance; and though they laboured to out-go each other in ab&s;urdity, yet he was denied the &s;mall con&s;o|lation
<PB N="321" REF="323">
of laughter. In &s;hort, the clergy having brought royalty under their feet, were re&s;olved to keep it &s;till &s;ub&s;ervient, and to trample upon it with all the contumely of &s;ucce&s;sful up&s;tarts. Charles for a while bore all their in&s;olence with hypocritical tranquili|ty, and even pretended to be highly edified by their in&s;tructions. He once, indeed, at|tempted to e&s;cape from among them; but being brought back, he owned the greatne&s;s of his error, he te&s;tified repentance for what he had done, and looked about for another op|portunity of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cromwell, who had been appointed to the command of the army in Ireland, pro&s;ecuted the war in that kingdom with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. He had to combat again&s;t the Royali&s;ts, commanded by the duke of Ormond, and the native Iri&s;h, led on by O'Neal. But &s;uch ill connected and barbarous troops could give very little oppo&s;ition to Cromwell's more numerous forces, conducted by &s;uch a general, and emboldened by long &s;uc|ce&s;s. He &s;oon over-ran the whole country; and after &s;ome time, all the towns revolted in his favour, and opened their gates at his ap|proach. But in the&s;e conque&s;ts, as in all the re&s;t of his actions, there appeared a brutal fe|rocity,
<PB N="322" REF="324">
that could tarni&s;h the mo&s;t heroic va|lour. In order to intimidate the natives from defending their towns, he, with a barbarous policy, put every garri&s;on that made any re|&s;i&s;tance to the &s;word. He entered the city of Drogheda by &s;torm, and indi&s;criminately butch|ered men, women, and children, &s;o that only one e&s;caped the dreadful carnage to give an account of the ma&s;&s;acre. He was now in the train of &s;peedily reducing the whole kingdom to &s;ubjection, when he was called over by the parliament to defend his own country again&s;t the Scotch, who, having e&s;pou&s;ed the royal cau&s;e, had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable army to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>After Cromwell's return to England, upon taking his &s;eat, he received the thanks of the hou&s;e, by the mouth of the &s;peaker, for the &s;ervices he had done the commonwealth in Ireland. They then proceeded to deliberate upon chu&s;ing a general for conducting the war in Scotland, which Fairfax refu&s;ing upon principle, as he had all along declined oppo&s;|ing the pre&s;byterians, the command nece&s;&s;a|rily devolved upon Cromwell. Fairfax, from that time forward declined meddling in public affairs; but &s;ending his commi&s;&s;ion of gene|rali&s;&s;imo to the hou&s;e, he retired to &s;pend the
<PB N="323" REF="325">
remainder of his life in peace and privacy. Cromwell, eager to pur&s;ue the path of ambi|tion that now lay before him, and being de|clared captain-general of the forces, boldly &s;et forward for Scotland, at the head of an army of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The Scotch, in the mean time, who had invited over their wretched king to be a pri|&s;oner, not a ruler, among them, prepared to meet the inva&s;ion. They had given the com|mand of their army to general Le&s;ley, a good officer, who formed a proper plan for their defence. This prudent commander knew, that though &s;uperior in numbers, his army was much inferior in di&s;cipline and experience to the Engli&s;h; and he kept him&s;elf carefully within his entrenchments. After &s;ome pre|vious motions on one &s;ide and the other, Cromwell, at la&s;t, &s;aw him&s;elf in a very di&s;|advantageous po&s;t near Dunbar, and his anta|goni&s;t waiting deliberately to take advantage of his &s;ituation.<MILESTONE N="1650" UNIT="A.D."> But the madne&s;s of the Scotch clergy &s;aved him from the imminent di&s;grace that was likely to attend him, and to their vain in&s;pirations he owed his &s;ecurity. The&s;e had it &s;eems been night and day wre&s;t|ling with the Lord in prayer, as they termed it; and they at la&s;t fancied that they had ob|tained the &s;uperiority. Revelations they &s;aid
<PB N="324" REF="326">
were made them, that the heretical army, toge|ther with Agag their general, would be delivered into their hands. Upon the a&s;&s;urances of the&s;e vi&s;ions, they obliged their general, in &s;pite of all his remon&s;trances, to de&s;cend into the plain, and give the Engli&s;h battle.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had their vi&s;ions and their a&s;|&s;urances on their &s;ide al&s;o. Cromwell, in his turn, had been wre&s;tling with the Lord, and had come off with &s;ucce&s;s. When he was told that the Scotch army were coming down to engage, he a&s;&s;ured his &s;oldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his hands; and he ordered his army to &s;ing p&s;alms, as already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain victory. The Scotch, though double the number of the Engli&s;h, were &s;oon put to flight, and pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter, while Cromwell did not lo&s;e above forty men in all.</P>
<P>The unfortunate king, who hated all the Scotch army, and only dreaded Cromwell, was well enough plea&s;ed at the defeat, which belied all the a&s;&s;urances of his oppre&s;&s;ors. It was attended al&s;o with this good con&s;equence to him, that it &s;erved to introduce him to a greater &s;hare of power than he had hitherto been permitted to enjoy. He now, therefore, put him&s;elf at the head of the &s;mall part of the Scotch army that had &s;urvived the defeat;
<PB N="325" REF="327">
and the&s;e he &s;till further &s;trengthened by the royali&s;ts, whom the covenanters had &s;ome time before excluded from his &s;ervice. Cromwell, however, &s;till followed his blow, pur&s;ued the king's forces towards Perth, and cutting off the provi&s;ions of the Scotch army, made it impo&s;&s;ible for Charles to maintain his forces in that country any longer.</P>
<P>In this terrible exigence he embraced a re|&s;olution worthy a prince, who was willing to hazard all for empire. Ob&s;erving that the way was open to England, he re&s;olved immediately to march into that country, where he expected to be reinforced by all the royali&s;ts in that part of the kingdom. His generals were per&s;uaded to enter into the &s;ame views; and with one con&s;ent the Scotch army, to the number of fourteen thou&s;and men, made an irruption &s;outhwards.</P>
<P>But Charles &s;oon found him&s;elf di&s;appoint|ed in the expectation of encrea&s;ing his army. The Scotch, terrified at the pro&s;pect of &s;o hazardous an enterprize, fell from him in great numbers. The Engli&s;h, affrighted at the name of his opponent, dreaded to join him; but his mortifications were &s;till more encrea&s;ed as he arrived at Worce&s;ter, when informed, that Cromwell was marching with ha&s;ty &s;trides
<PB N="326" REF="328">
from Scotland, with an army encrea&s;ed to forty thou&s;and men. The news &s;carce arrived, when that active general him&s;elf appeared; and falling upon the town on all &s;ides, broke in upon the di&s;ordered royali&s;ts. The &s;treets were &s;trewed with &s;laughter, the whole Scotch army was either killed or taken pri&s;oners, and the king him&s;elf, having given many proofs of per&s;onal valour, was obliged to fly.</P>
<P>Imagination can &s;carce conceive adventures more romantic, or di&s;tre&s;&s;es more &s;evere, than tho&s;e which attended the young king's e&s;cape from the &s;cene of &s;laughter. After his hair was cut off, the better to di&s;gui&s;e his per&s;on, he wrought for &s;ome days in the habit of a pea&s;ant, cutting faggots in a wood. He next made an attempt to retire into Wales, under the conduct of one Pendrel, a poor farmer, who was &s;incerely attached to his cau&s;e. In this attempt, however, he was di&s;appointed, every pa&s;s being guarded to prevent his e&s;cape. Being obliged to return, he met one colonel Carele&s;s, who, like him&s;elf, had e&s;cap|ed the carnage at Worce&s;ter; and it was in his company that he was obliged to climb a &s;preading oak, among the thick branches of which they pa&s;&s;ed the day together, while they heard the &s;oldiers of the enemy in pur&s;uit of
<PB N="327" REF="329">
them below. From thence he pa&s;&s;ed, with imminent danger, feeling all the varieties of famine, fatigue, and pain, till he arrived at the hou&s;e of one colonel Lane, a zealous roy|ali&s;t in Stafford&s;hire. There he deliberated about the means of e&s;caping into France; and Bri&s;tol being &s;uppo&s;ed the propere&s;t port, it was agreed that he &s;hould ride thither, before this gentleman's &s;i&s;ter, on a vi&s;it to one Mrs. Norton, who lived in the neighbourhood of that city. During this journey he every day met with per&s;ons, who&s;e faces he knew; and at one time pa&s;&s;ed through a whole regiment of the enemy's army.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Mrs. Norton's, the fir&s;t per&s;on they &s;aw was one of his own chap|lains &s;itting at the door, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;eeing people play at bowls. The king, after having taken proper care of his hor&s;e in the &s;table, was &s;hewn to an apartment, which Mrs. Lane had provided for him, as it was &s;aid he had the ague. The butler, however, being &s;ent to him with &s;ome refre&s;hment, no &s;ooner beheld his face, which was very pale with anxiety and fatigue, then he recollected his king and ma&s;ter; and falling upon his knees, while the tears &s;treamed down his cheeks, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"I am rejoiced to &s;ee your ma|je&s;ty."</Q>
<PB N="328" REF="330">
The king was alarmed, but made the butler promi&s;e that he would keep the &s;ecret from every mortal, even from his ma&s;ter; and the hone&s;t &s;ervant punctually obeyed him.</P>
<P>No &s;hip being found that would for a month &s;et &s;ail from Bri&s;tol, either for France or Spain, the king was obliged to go el&s;ewhere for a pa&s;&s;age. He therefore repaired to the hou&s;e of colonel Wyndham, in Dor&s;et&s;hire, where he was cordially received; that gentleman's family having ever been loyal. His mother, a venerable matron, &s;eemed to think the end of her life nobly rewarded, in having it in her power to give protection to her king. She expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;atisfaction at having lo&s;t three &s;ons, and one grand-child in the defence of his cau&s;e, &s;ince &s;he was honoured in being in|&s;trumental to his own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing from thence his journey to the &s;ea|&s;ide, he once more had a very providential e&s;cape from a little inn, where he &s;et up for the night. The day had been appointed by parliament for a &s;olemn fa&s;t; and a fanati|cal weaver, who had been a &s;oldier in the parlia|ment army, was preaching again&s;t the king in a little chapel fronting the hou&s;e. Charles, to a|void &s;u&s;picion, was him&s;elf among the audience. It happened, that a &s;mith of the &s;ame princi|ples
<PB N="329" REF="331">
with the weaver had been examining the hor&s;es belonging to the pa&s;&s;engers, and came to a&s;&s;ure the preacher that he knew by the fa&s;hion of the &s;hoes, that one of the &s;trangers hor&s;es came from the north. The preacher immediately affirmed that this hor&s;e could be|long to no other than Charles Stuart, and in|&s;tantly went with a con&s;table to &s;earch the inn. But Charles had taken timely precautions, and had left the inn before the con&s;table's ar|rival.</P>
<P>At Shoreham, in Su&s;&s;ex, a ve&s;&s;el was at la&s;t found, in which he embarked. He was known to &s;o many, that if he had not &s;et &s;ail in that critical moment, it had been impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape. After one and forty days concealment, he arrived &s;afely at Fe&s;champ in Normandy. No le&s;s than forty men and women had, at different times, been privy to his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cromwell, crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, returned in triumph to London, where he was met by the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, ac|companied by the mayor of London, and the magi&s;trates, in all their formalities. His fir&s;t care was to take advantage of his late &s;ucce&s;|&s;es, by depre&s;&s;ing the Scotch, who had &s;o lately with&s;tood the work of the Go&s;pel, as he called
<PB N="330" REF="332">
it. An act was pa&s;&s;ed for aboli&s;hing royalty in Scotland, and annexing that kingdom, as a conquered province, to the Engli&s;h common|wealth. It was impowered, however, to &s;end &s;ome members to the Engli&s;h parliament. Judges were appointed to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice; and the people of that country, now freed from the tyranny of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, were not much di&s;atisfied with their pre&s;ent government. The prudent conduct of Monk, who had was left by Cromwell to complete their &s;ub|jection, &s;erved much to reconcile the minds of the people, harra&s;&s;ed with di&s;&s;en&s;ions, of which they never well under&s;tood the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner the Engli&s;h parliament, by the means of Cromwell, &s;pread their uncon|te&s;ted authority over all the Briti&s;h dominions. Ireland was totally &s;ubdued by Ireton and Ludlow. All the &s;ettlements in America, that had declared for the royal cau&s;e, were obliged to &s;ubmit; Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Scilly, and the I&s;le of Man, were brought ea&s;ily under &s;ub|jection. Thus mankind &s;aw, with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, a parliament compo&s;ed of &s;ixty or &s;even|ty ob&s;cure and illiterate members, governing a great empire with unanimity and &s;ucce&s;s. Without any acknowledged &s;ubordination, ex|cept a council of &s;tate con&s;i&s;ting of thirty-eight,
<PB N="331" REF="333">
to whom all addre&s;&s;es were made, they levied armies, maintained fleets, and gave laws to the neighbouring powers of Europe. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactne&s;s. Few private per&s;ons became rich by the plunder of the public: the revenues of the crown, the lands of the bi&s;hops, and a tax of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds each month, &s;upplied the wants of the govern|ment, and gave vigour to all their proceed|ings.</P>
<P>The parliament, having thus reduced their native dominions to perfect obedience, next re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e the Dutch, who had given but very &s;light cau&s;es of complaint. It hap|pened that one doctor Dori&s;laus, who was of the number of the late king's judges being &s;ent by the parliament as their envoy to Holland, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by one of the royal party, who had taken refuge there. Some time after al&s;o Mr. St. John, appointed their amba&s;&s;ador to that court, was in&s;ulted by the friends of the prince of Orange. The&s;e were thought motives &s;uffi|cient to induce the commonwealth of England to declare war again&s;t them. The parliament's chief dependence lay in the activity and cou|rage of Blake, their admiral; who, though he had not embarked in naval command till late
<PB N="332" REF="334">
in life, yet &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all that went before him in courage and dexterity. On the other &s;ide, the Dutch oppo&s;ed to him their famous ad|miral Van Tromp, to whom they never &s;ince produced an equal. Many were the engage|ments between the&s;e celebrated admirals, and various was their &s;ucce&s;s. Sea-fights, in gene|ral, &s;eldom prove deci&s;ive; and the vanqui&s;hed are &s;oon &s;een to make head again&s;t the victors. Several dreadful encounters, therefore, rather &s;erved to &s;hew the excellence of the admirals, than to determine their &s;uperiority. The Dutch, however, who felt many great di&s;ad|vantages by the lo&s;s of their trade; and by the total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their fi&s;heries, were willing to treat for a peace; but the parliament gave them a very unfavourable an&s;wer. It was the policy of that body, to keep their navy on foot as long as they could; rightly judging, that while the force of the nation was exerted by &s;ea, it would dimini&s;h the power of general Cromwell by land, which was now become very formidable to them.</P>
<P>This great a&s;pirer, however, quickly per|ceived their de&s;igns; and from the fir&s;t &s;aw that they dreaded his growing power, and wi&s;h|ed its diminution. All his mea&s;ures were con|ducted with a bold intrepidity that marked
<PB N="333" REF="335">
his character; and he now &s;aw, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to wear the ma&s;k of &s;ubordination any longer. Secure, therefore, in the attach|ment of the army, he re&s;olved to make another daring effort; and per&s;uaded the officers to pre&s;ent a petition for payment of arrears and redre&s;s of grievances, which he knew would be rejected with di&s;dain. The petition was &s;oon drawn up and pre&s;ented, in which the officers, after demanding their arrears, de&s;ired the par|liament to con&s;ider how many years they had &s;at; <MILESTONE N="1653" UNIT="A.D."> and what profe&s;&s;ions they had formerly made of their intentions to new model the hou&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;h freedom on the broade&s;t ba&s;is. They alledged, that it was now full time to give place to others; and however me|ritorious their actions might have been, yet the re&s;t of the nation had &s;ome right, in turn, to &s;hew their patrioti&s;m in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was highly offended at the pre|&s;umption of the army, although they had &s;een, but too lately, that their own power was wholly founded on that very pre&s;umption. They appointed a committee to prepare an act, or|daining that all per&s;ons who pre&s;ented &s;uch pe|titions, for the future, &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea&s;on. To this the officers made a
<PB N="334" REF="336">
very warm remon&s;trance, and the parliament as angry a reply; while the breach between them every moment grew wider. This was what Cromwell had long wi&s;hed, and had well fore&s;een. He was &s;itting in council with his officers, when informed of the &s;ubject on which the hou&s;e was deliberating; upon which he ro&s;e up in the mo&s;t &s;eeming fury, and turn|ing to major Vernon, cried out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was compelled to do a thing that made the very hair of his head &s;tand on end."</Q>
Then ha&s;tening to the hou&s;e with three hundred &s;ol|diers, and with the marks of violent indigna|tion on his countenance he entered, took his place, and attended to the debates for &s;ome time. When the que&s;tion was ready to be put, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, and began to load the parliament with the vile&s;t reproaches for their tyranny, ambition, oppre&s;&s;ion, and rob|bery of the public. Upon which, &s;tamping with his foot, which was the &s;ignal for the &s;oldiers to enter, the place was immediately filled with armed men. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the members:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For &s;hame, &s;aid he, get you gone. Give place to hone&s;ter men; to tho&s;e who will more faithfully di&s;charge their tru&s;t. You are no longer a parliament; I tell you you are no longer a parliament; the Lord
<PB N="335" REF="337">
has done with you."</Q>
Sir Harry Vane ex|claiming again&s;t this conduct:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir Harry, cried Cromwell with a loud voice, O Sir Harry Vane, the Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane."</Q>
Taking hold of Martin by the cloak, thou art a whore ma&s;ter; to an|other, thou art an adulterer; to a third, thou art a drunkard; and to a fourth, thou art a glut|ton.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is you, continued he to the mem|bers, that have forced me upon this. I have &s;ought the Lord night and day that he would rather &s;lay me than put me upon this work."</Q>
Then pointing to the mace,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Take away, cried he, that bauble."</Q>
After which, turning out all the members, and clearing the hall, he ordered the doors to be locked, and putting the key in his pocket, returned to Whitehall.</P>
<P>Thus, by one daring exploit, the new re|public was aboli&s;hed, and the whole command, civil and military, centered in Cromwell only. The people, however, that were &s;pectators in &s;i|lent wonder of all the&s;e precipitate tran&s;actions, expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;approbation at the di&s;&s;olution of a parliament that had overturned the con|&s;titution, and de&s;troyed the king. On the contrary, the u&s;urper received congratulatory addre&s;&s;es from the fleet, the corporations, and
<PB N="336" REF="338">
the army, for having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a parliament that had &s;ubjected them to the mo&s;t cruel im|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>But this politic man was too cautious to be &s;educed by their prai&s;e, or driven on by their exhortations. Unwilling to put forth all his power at once, he re&s;olved &s;till to amu&s;e the people with the form of a commonwealth, which it was the delu&s;ion of the times to ad|mire, and to give them a parliament that would be entirely &s;ub&s;ervient to his commands. For this purpo&s;e, con&s;ulting with &s;ome of the principal officers, it was decreed, that the &s;o|vereign power &s;hould be ve&s;ted in one hun|dred and forty-four per&s;ons, under the deno|mination of a parliament; and he undertook him&s;elf to make the choice.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons pitched upon for exerci&s;ing this &s;eemingly important tru&s;t, were the low|e&s;t, meane&s;t, and the mo&s;t ignorant among the citizens, and the very dregs of the fanatics. He was well apprized that during the admini|&s;tration of &s;uch a groupe of characters he alone mu&s;t govern, or that they mu&s;t &s;oon throw up the reins of government, which they were unqualified to guide. Accordingly, their practice ju&s;tified his &s;agacity. To go further than others into the ab&s;urdities of fanatici&s;m
<PB N="337" REF="339">
was the chief qualification which each of the&s;e valued him&s;elf upon. Their very names, com|po&s;ed of cant phra&s;es borrowed from Scrip|ture, and rendered ridiculous by their mi&s;ap|plication, &s;erved to &s;hew their exce&s;s of folly. Not only the names of Zerobabel, Habba|kuk, and Me&s;opotamia were given to tho&s;e ignorant creatures, but &s;ometimes whole &s;en|tences from Scripture. One of them parti|cularly, who was called Prai&s;e God Barebone, a canting leather&s;eller, gave his name to this odd a&s;&s;embly, and it was called Barebone's parliament.</P>
<P>Their attempts at legi&s;lation were entirely corre&s;pondent to their &s;tations and characters. As they were chiefly compo&s;ed of antino|mians, a &s;ect that, after receiving the &s;pirit, &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves incapable of error, and of fifth monarchy men, who every hour ex|pected Chri&s;t's coming on earth, they began by chu&s;ing eight of their tribe to &s;eek the Lord in prayer, while the re&s;t calmly &s;at down to deliberate upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the clergy, the univer&s;ities, the courts of ju&s;tice; and in|&s;tead of all this it was their intent to &s;ub&s;ti|tute the law of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>To this hopeful a&s;&s;embly was committed the treaty of peace with the Dutch; but
<PB N="338" REF="340">
the amba&s;&s;adors from that nation, though them&s;elves pre&s;byterians, were quite carnal minded to the&s;e. They were regarded by the new parliament as worldly men, intent on com|merce and indu&s;try, and therefore not to be treated with. They in&s;i&s;ted that the man of &s;in &s;hould be put away, and a new birth ob|tained by prayer and meditation. The amba&s;|&s;adors finding them&s;elves unable to conver&s;e with them in their own way, gave up the treaty as hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>The very vulgar began now to exclaim a|gain&s;t &s;o fooli&s;h a legi&s;lature; and they them|&s;elves &s;eemed not in&s;en&s;ible of the ridicule which every day was thrown out again&s;t them. Cromwell was probably well enough plea&s;ed to find that his power was likely to receive no di|minution from their endeavours; but began to be a&s;hamed of their complicated ab&s;urdi|ties. He had carefully cho&s;en many per&s;ons among them entirely devoted to his inter|e&s;ts, and the&s;e he commanded to di&s;mi&s;s the a&s;&s;embly. Accordingly, by concert, they met earlier than the re&s;t of their fraternity; and ob&s;erving to each other that this parlia|ment had &s;at long enough, they ha&s;tened to Cromwell, with Rou&s;e their &s;peaker at their head, and into his hands they re&s;igned the authority with which he had inve&s;ted them.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="341">Cromwell accepted their re&s;ignation with plea&s;ure; but being told that &s;ome of the number were refractory, he &s;ent colonel White to clear the hou&s;e of &s;uch as ventured to re|main there. They had placed one Moyer in the chair by the time that the colonel had ar|rived; and he being a&s;ked by the colonel <Q REND="inline">"What they did there?"</Q> Moyer replied very gravely, that they were &s;eeking the Lord.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then you may go el&s;ewhere, cried White; for to my certain knowlege the Lord has not been here the&s;e many years."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;hadow of a parliament being di&s;&s;olved, the officers, by their own authority, declared Cromwell protector of the commonwealth of England. Nothing now could with&s;tand his authority; the mayor and aldermen were &s;ent for to give &s;olemnity to his appointment; and he was in&s;tituted into his new office at White|hall, in the palace of the kings of England. He was to be addre&s;&s;ed by the title of high|ne&s;s; and his power was proclaimed in Lon|don, and other parts of the kingdom. Thus an ob&s;cure and vulgar man, at the age of fifty-three, ro&s;e to unbounded power, fir&s;t by following &s;mall events in his favour, and at length by directing great ones.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="342">It was, indeed, in a great mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould take the &s;upreme com|mand; for affairs were brought into &s;uch a &s;ituation by the furious animo&s;ities of the con|tending parties, that, nothing but ab&s;olute power could prevent a renewal of former blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion. Cromwell, there|fore, might have &s;aid with &s;ome ju&s;tice upon his in&s;tallation, that he accepted the dignity of protector merely that he might pre&s;erve the peace of the nation; and this it mu&s;t be own|ed he effected with equal conduct, modera|tion, and &s;ucce&s;s. The government of the kingdom was adju&s;ted in the following man|ner. A council was appointed, which was not to exceed twenty-one, nor to be under thir|teen per&s;ons. The&s;e were to enjoy their of|fices for life, or during good behaviour; and, in ca&s;e of a vacancy, the remaining members named three, of whom the protector cho&s;e one. The protector was appointed the &s;u|preme magi&s;trate of the commonwealth, with &s;uch powers as the king was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The power of the &s;word was ve&s;ted in him jointly with the parliament when &s;itting, or with the council at intervals. He was obliged to &s;ummon a parliament every three years, and to allow them to &s;it five months without
<PB N="341" REF="343">
adjournment. A &s;tanding army was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed of twenty thou&s;and foot, and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, and funds were a&s;&s;igned for their &s;up|port. The protector enjoyed his office during life; and on his death the place was immedi|ately to be &s;upplied by the council. Of all tho&s;e clau&s;es the &s;tanding army was alone &s;ufficient for Cromwell's purpo&s;e; for while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that in&s;trument, he could mould the re&s;t of the con|&s;titution to his plea&s;ure at any time.</P>
<P>Cromwell cho&s;e his council among his offi|cers, who had been the companions of his dangers and his victories, to each of whom he a&s;&s;igned a pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and pounds a year. He took care to have his troops, upon who&s;e fidelity he depended for &s;upport, paid a month in advance; the maga|zines were al&s;o well provided, and the public trea&s;ure managed with frugality and care: while his activity, vigilance, and re&s;olution were &s;uch, that he di&s;covered every con&s;piracy again&s;t his per&s;on, and every plot for an in|&s;urrection before they took effect.</P>
<P>His management of foreign affairs, though his &s;chemes were by no means political, yet well corre&s;ponded with his character, and, for a while, were attended with &s;ucce&s;s. The Dutch having been humbled by repeated de|feats,
<PB N="342" REF="344">
and totally abridged in their commer|cial concerns; were obliged at la&s;t to &s;ue for peace, which he gave them upon terms ra|ther too favourable. He in&s;i&s;ted upon their paying deference to the Briti&s;h flag. He com|pelled them to abandon the intere&s;ts of the king, and to pay eighty-five thou&s;and pounds as an indemnification for former expences, and to re&s;tore the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company a part of tho&s;e dominions of which they had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch during the former reign, in that di&s;tant part of the world.</P>
<P>He was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in his negotiations with the court of France. Cardinal Maza|rine, by whom the affairs of that kingdom were conducted, deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to pay deference to the protector; and de&s;irous ra|ther to prevail by dexterity than violence, &s;ub|mitted to Cromwell's imperious character, and thus procured ends equally beneficial to both.</P>
<P>The court of Spain was not le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in its endeavours to gain his friend&s;hip, but was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful. This va&s;t monarchy, which but a few years before had threatened the liberties of Europe, was now reduced &s;o low as to be &s;carce able to defend it&s;elf. Crom|well, however, who knew nothing of foreign

politics, &s;till continued to regard its power with an eye of jealou&s;y, and came into an a&s;&s;ociation with France to depre&s;s it &s;till more. He lent that court a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men to attack the Spani&s;h dominions in the Nether|lands; and upon obtaining a &s;ignal victory by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance at Dunes, the French put Dun|kirk, which they had ju&s;t taken from the Spa|niards, into his hands, as a reward for his at|tachment.</P>
<P>But it was by &s;ea that he humbled the power of Spain with &s;till more effectual &s;ucce&s;s. Blake, who had long made him&s;elf formidable to the Dutch, and who&s;e fame was &s;pread over Europe, now became &s;till more dreadful to the Spani&s;h monarchy. He &s;ailed with a fleet into the Mediterranean, whither, &s;ince the time of the cru&s;ades, no Engli&s;h fleet had ever ven|tured to advance. He there conquered all that ventured to oppo&s;e him. Ca&s;ting anchor before Leghorn, he demanded and obtained &s;atisfaction for &s;ome injuries which the Engli&s;h commerce had &s;uffered from the duke of Tu&s;cany. He next &s;ailed to Algiers, and compelled the Dey to make peace,<MILESTONE N="1655" UNIT="A.D."> and to re&s;train his pyratical &s;ubjects from farther in|juring the Engli&s;h. He then went to Tunis, and having made the &s;ame demands, he was
<PB N="344" REF="346">
de&s;ired by the Dey of that place to look at the two ca&s;tles, Porto Farino, and Goletta, and do his utmo&s;t. Blake &s;hewed him that he was not &s;low in accepting the challenge; he entered the harbour, burned the &s;hipping there, and then &s;ailed out triumphantly to pur&s;ue his voyage. At Cadiz, he took two galleons valued at near two million pieces of eight. At the Canaries, he burned a Spani&s;h fleet of &s;ixteen &s;hips, and returning home to England to enjoy the &s;ame of his noble actions, as he came within &s;ight of his native country he expired. This gallant man, though he fought for an u&s;urper, yet was aver&s;e to his cau&s;e; he was a zealous republican in principle, and his aim was to &s;erve his country, not to e&s;tabli&s;h a tyrant. <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;till our duty, he would &s;ay to the &s;ea-men, to fight for our country into whatever hands the government may fall."</Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that Blake's expeditions were going forward, there was another carried on under the command of admiral Pen and Venables, with about four thou&s;and land-forces, to attack the I&s;land of Hi&s;paniola. Failing however, in this, and being driven off the place by the Spaniards, they &s;teered to Jamai|ca, which was &s;urrendered to them without a
<PB N="345" REF="347">
blow. So little was thought of the impor|tance of this conque&s;t, that, upon the return of the expedition, Pen and Venables were &s;ent to the Tower, for their failure in the prin|cipal object of their expedition.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es might rather be a&s;cribed to the &s;pirit of the times, than the conductor of them. Cromwell was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but two arts in perfection, that of managing the army, by which he ruled; and obtaining the &s;ecrets of his enemies that were plotting again&s;t him. For the fir&s;t, his valour and canting zeal were &s;ufficient; for the latter, it is &s;aid he paid &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a year to his &s;pies to come by his intelligence. But he took care to make the nation refund tho&s;e extraordinary &s;ums which he ex|pended for &s;uch information. One or two con&s;pi|racies entered into by the royali&s;ts, which were detected and puni&s;hed, &s;erved him as a pretext to lay an heavy tax upon all of that party, of a tenth penny on all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. In order to rai&s;e this oppre&s;&s;ive impo&s;ition, ten major-generals were in&s;tituted, who divided the whole kingdom into &s;o many military juri&s;dic|tions. The&s;e men had power to &s;ubject whom they plea&s;ed to a payment of this tax, and to impri&s;on &s;uch as denied their juri&s;dic|tion. Under colour of the&s;e powers, they
<PB N="346" REF="348">
exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t arbitrary authority; the people had no protection again&s;t their exac|tions; the very ma&s;k of liberty was thrown off, and all property was at the di&s;po&s;al of a military tribunal. It was in vain that the na|tion cried out for a free parliament; Crom|well a&s;&s;embled one in con&s;equence of their clamours; but as &s;peedily di&s;&s;olved it, when he found it refractory to his commands.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of univer&s;al dejection, in which Scotland and Ireland were treated as conquered provinces, in which the protector i&s;&s;ued his ab&s;olute orders without even the ma&s;k of his former hypocri&s;y, and in which all tru&s;t and confidence were lo&s;t in every &s;ocial meeting, the people were &s;truck with a new in&s;tance of the u&s;urper's ambition. As parliaments were ever dear to the people, it was re&s;olved to give them one; but &s;uch as &s;hould be entirely of the protector's chu&s;ing, and chiefly compo&s;ed of his own creatures. Le&s;t any of a different complexion &s;hould pre&s;ume to enter the hou&s;e, guards were placed at the door, and none ad|mitted but &s;uch as produced a warrant from his council. The principal de&s;ign of conven|ing this a&s;&s;embly was, that they &s;hould of|fer him the crown, with the title of king, and all the other en&s;igns of royalty.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349">His creatures, therefore, took care to in|fu&s;e into this a&s;&s;embly the merits of the pro|tector; the confu&s;ion there was in legal pro|ceedings without the name of a king; that no man was acquainted with the extent or li|mits of the pre&s;ent magi&s;trate's authority, but tho&s;e of a king had been well a&s;certained by the experience of ages. At la&s;t the motion was made in form in the hou&s;e, by alderman Pack, one of the city members, for inve&s;ting the protector with the regal dignity. The majority of the hou&s;e being Cromwell's crea|tures, it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that the bill was voted according to his &s;ecret wi&s;hes; and nothing now remained but his own con&s;ent to have his name enrolled among the kings of England.</P>
<P>Whether it was his original intention by having this bill carried through the hou&s;e, to &s;hew that he was magnanimous enough to re|fu&s;e the offer, or whether finding &s;ome of tho&s;e on whom he mo&s;t depended aver&s;e to his tak|ing the title, cannot now be known. Certain it is his doubts continued for &s;ome days; and the conference which he carried on with the mem|bers who were &s;ent to make him the offer, &s;eems to argue that he was de&s;irous of being compelled to accept what he feared openly to
<PB N="348" REF="350">
a&s;&s;ume. The ob&s;curity of his an&s;wers, the ab&s;urdity of his &s;peeches on this occa&s;ion (for they &s;till remain) &s;hew plainly a mind at va|riance with it&s;elf, and combatting only with a wi&s;h to be vanqui&s;hed.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I confe&s;s, &s;aid he, for it behoves me to deal plainly with you, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I would &s;ay I hope I may be under&s;tood in this; for indeed I mu&s;t be tender what I would &s;ay to &s;uch an audience as this; I &s;ay I would be under&s;tood, that in this argument I do not make a parallel between men of a different mind, and a parliament which &s;hall have their de&s;ires. I know there is no compari&s;on; nor can it be urged upon me that my words have the lea&s;t colour that way, becau&s;e the parlia|ment &s;eems to me to give liberty to me to &s;ay any thing to you.

If I &s;ay I &s;hould not tell you knowing their minds to be &s;o, I &s;hould not be faithful if I &s;hould not tell you &s;o, to the end that you may report it to par|liament."</Q>
In this manner did this mo&s;t
<PB N="349" REF="351">
unaccountable of all characters an&s;wer their petitions for his a&s;&s;uming the kingly name and dignity; however the conference ended in his refu&s;ing their offer.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that his &s;itua|tion, with all the&s;e offered honours, was at this time enviable? Perhaps no &s;tation, however mean, or loaded with contempt, could be more truly di&s;tre&s;sful than his, at a time the nation was loading him with congratulations and ad|dre&s;&s;es. He had by this,<MILESTONE N="1658" UNIT="A.D."> rendered him&s;elf hateful to every party; and he owed his &s;afety to their mutual hatred and diffidence of each other. His arts of di&s;&s;imulation had been long exhau&s;ted; none now could be deceived by them, tho&s;e of his own party and princi|ples, di&s;daining the u&s;e to which he had con|verted his zeal and profe&s;&s;ions. The truth &s;eems to be, if we may u&s;e a phra&s;e taken from common life, he had began with being a dupe to his own enthu&s;ia&s;ms, and ended with being a &s;harper.</P>
<P>The whole nation &s;ilently dete&s;ted his admi|ni&s;tration, but he had not &s;till been reduced to the extreme of wretchedne&s;s, if he could have found dome&s;tic con&s;olation. Fleetwood, his &s;on in-law, actuated with the wilde&s;t zeal, de|te&s;ted that character which could u&s;e religious
<PB N="350" REF="352">
profe&s;&s;ions for the purpo&s;es of temporal ad|vancement. His elde&s;t daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted republican principles &s;o vehemently, that &s;he could not behold even her own father entru&s;ted with uncontrolable power. His other daughters were no le&s;s &s;anguine in favour of the royal cau&s;e; but above all, Mrs. Claypole, his favourite daugh|ter, who, upon her death-bed, upbraided him with all tho&s;e crimes that led him to trample on the throne.</P>
<P>Every hour added &s;ome new di&s;quietude. Lord Fairfax, Sir William Waller, and many of the heads of the pre&s;byterians, had &s;ecretly entered into an engagement to de&s;troy him. His admini&s;tration, &s;o expen&s;ive both at home and abroad, had exhau&s;ted his revenue, and he was left con&s;iderably in debt. One con&s;piracy was no &s;ooner detected, but another ro&s;e from its ruins; and to encrea&s;e his calamity, he was now taught, upon rea&s;oning principles, that his death was not only de&s;irable, but his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation would be meritorious. A book was publi&s;hed by colonel Titus, a man who had formerly been attached to his cau&s;e, en|titled <HI>Killing no Murder.</HI> Of all the pam|phlets that came forth at that time, or perhaps of tho&s;e that have &s;ince appeared, this was the
<PB N="351" REF="353">
mo&s;t eloquent and ma&s;terly. Shall we, &s;aid this popular declaimer, who would not &s;uffer the lion to invade us, tamely &s;tand to be de|voured by the wolf. Cromwell read this &s;pi|rited treati&s;e, and was never &s;een to &s;mile more.</P>
<P>All peace was now for ever bani&s;hed from his mind. He now found, that the grandeur to which he had &s;acrificed his former peace, was only an inlet to fre&s;h inquietudes. The fears of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination haunted him in all his walks, and was perpetually pre&s;ent to his imagination. He wore armour under his cloaths, and always kept pi&s;tols in his pockets. His a&s;pect was clouded by a &s;ettled gloom; and he regarded every &s;tranger with a glance of timid &s;u&s;picion. He always travelled with hurry, and was ever attended by a numerous guard. He never returned from any place by the road he went; and &s;eldom &s;lept above three nights together in the &s;ame chamber. Society terrified him, as there he might meet an enemy; &s;olitude was terrible, as he was there unguarded by every friend.</P>
<P>A tertian ague kindly came at la&s;t to deli|ver him from this life of horror and anxiety. For the &s;pace of a week no dangerous &s;ymp|toms appeared; and in the intervals of the
<PB N="352" REF="354">
fits he was able to walk abroad. At length the fever encrea&s;ed, and he him&s;elf began to dread his approaching fate; but he was taught to con&s;ider his pre&s;ent di&s;order as no way fa|tal, by his fanatic chaplains, on whom he en|tirely relied. When his chaplain Goodwin told him that the elect would never be damned, then
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;ure, &s;aid he, that I am &s;afe; for I was once in a &s;tate of grace."</Q>
His phy&s;icians were &s;en&s;ible of his dangerous ca&s;e; but he was &s;o much encouraged by the reve|lations of his preachers, that he con&s;idered his recovery as no way doubtful.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I tell you, cried he to the phy&s;icians, that I &s;hall not die of this di&s;temper; I am well a&s;&s;ured of my recovery. Favourable an&s;wers have been returned from heaven, not only to my own &s;upplications, but likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of the godly, who have a clo&s;er corre&s;pond|ence with God than I. Ye may have &s;kill in your profe&s;&s;ion; but nature can do more than all the phy&s;icians in the world; and God is far above nature."</Q>
Upon a fa&s;t day appointed on account of his &s;ickne&s;s, his mini&s;ters thanked God for the undoubted pledges they had received of his recovery. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e a&s;&s;urances the fatal &s;ymp|toms every hour encrea&s;ed; and the phy&s;i|cians
<PB N="353" REF="355">
were obliged to declare that he could not &s;urvive the next fit. The council now there|fore came to know his la&s;t commands concern|ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but his &s;en&s;es were gone, and he was ju&s;t able to an&s;wer yes to their de|mand, whether his &s;on Richard &s;hould be ap|pointed to &s;ucceed him. He died on the third day of September, that very day which he had always con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fortunate of his life; he was then fifty-nine years old,<MILESTONE N="1658" UNIT="A.D."> and had u&s;urped the government nine years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. From the Death of OLIVER CROMWELL to the RESTORATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER might have been the differences of intere&s;t after the death of the u&s;urper, the influence of his name was &s;till &s;ufficient to get Richard his &s;on proclaimed protector in his room. It was probably owing to the numerous parties that were formed in the kingdom, and their hatred of each other, that Richard owed his peaceable advancement to this high &s;tation. He was naturally no way ambitious, being rather mild, ea&s;y, and good-natured; and honour &s;eemed rather to pur&s;ue, than to attract him. He had nothing active in his di&s;po&s;ition; no talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, no knowledge of government, no influence among the &s;oldiery, no importance in council.</P>
<P>It was found nece&s;&s;ary, upon his fir&s;t ad|vancement, to call a parliament, to furni&s;h the &s;upplies to carry on the ordinary ope|rations of government. The hou&s;e of com|mons was formed legally enough; but the hou&s;e of lords con&s;i&s;ted only of tho&s;e per&s;ons
<PB N="355" REF="357">
of no real title, who were advanced to that dignified &s;tation by the late protector. But it was not on the parliament that the army cho&s;e to rely. A great number of the principal male|contents of the army, e&s;tabli&s;hed a meeting at general Fleetwood's, which, as he dwelt in Wallingford-hou&s;e, was called the Cabal of Wallingford. The re&s;ult of their delibera|tions was a remon&s;trance that the command of the army &s;hould be entru&s;ted to &s;ome per|&s;on in whom they might all confide; and it was plainly given to under&s;tand that the young protector was not that per&s;on.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al &s;o daring and dangerous did not fail to alarm Richard; he applied to his coun|cil, and they referred it to the parliament. Both agreed to con&s;ider it as an audacious at|tempt, and a vote was pa&s;&s;ed that there &s;hould be no meeting, or general council of officers, without the protector's permi&s;&s;ion. This brought affairs immediately to a rupture. The palace of the protector was the next day &s;ur|rounded by a body of officers; and one De&s;bo|row, a man of a clowni&s;h brutal nature, pene|trating into his apartment with an armed re|tinue, threatened him if he &s;hould refu&s;e. Richard wanted re&s;olution to defend what had been conferred upon him; he di&s;&s;olved the
<PB N="356" REF="358">
parliament then, and &s;oon after he &s;igned his own abdication in form.</P>
<P>Henry Cromwell, his younger brother, who was appointed to the command in Ireland, fol|lowed the protector's example, and re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion without &s;triking a blow. Rich|ard lived &s;everal years after his re&s;ignation, at fir&s;t on the continent, and afterwards upon his paternal fortune at home. He was thought by the ignorant to be unworthy of the happi|ne&s;s of his exaltation; but he knew by his tranquility in private, that he had made the mo&s;t fortunate e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The officers being once more left to them|&s;elves, determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the king, and which Cromwell had &s;o di&s;gracefully turned out of the hou&s;e. This was called the good old cau&s;e from their attachment to re|publican principles; and to the members of this, the cabal of officers for a while delivered up their own authority. The members, who had been &s;ecluded by colonel Pride's purge, as it was called, attempted, but in vain, to re&s;ume their &s;eats among them.</P>
<P>The Rump parliament, for that was the name it went by, although rein&s;tated by the army, was yet very vigorous in its attempts to le&s;&s;en the
<PB N="357" REF="359">
power by which it was replaced. The members began their de&s;ign of humbling the army by new modelling part of the forces, by ca&s;hiering &s;uch of the officers as they feared, and appoint|ing others, on whom they could rely, in their room. The&s;e attempts, however, were not unob&s;erved by the officers; and their di&s;con|tent would have broke out into &s;ome re&s;olu|tion, fatal to the parliament, had it not been checked by apprehen&s;ions of danger from the royali&s;ts, or pre&s;byterians, who were con&s;ider|ed as the common enemy.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the officers held &s;everal conferences together, with a de&s;ign to con|tinue their power. They at length came to a re&s;olution, u&s;ual enough in the&s;e times, to di&s;&s;olve that a&s;&s;embly, by which they were &s;o vehemently oppo&s;ed. Accordingly Lambert, one of the general officers, drew up a cho&s;en body of troops; and placing them in the &s;treets which led to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, when the &s;peaker Lenthall proceeded in his carriage to the hou&s;e, he ordered the hor&s;es to be turned, and very civily conducted him home. The other members were likewi&s;e intercepted, and the army returned to their quarters to ob&s;erve a &s;o|lemn fa&s;t, which generally either proceeded, or attended their outrages.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360">The officers having thus re&s;umed the power they had given, re&s;olved not to part with it for the future upon ea&s;y terms. They elected a committee of twenty-three per&s;ons, of whom &s;even were officers; the&s;e they called a com|mittee of &s;afety, and pretended to inve&s;t them with &s;overeign authority. Fleetwood, a weak zealot, was made commander in chief; Lambert, an artful ambitious man, major-general; De&s;borow, lieutenant-general; and Monk, who had been inve&s;ted by Cromwell with the government of Scotland, was appoint|ed major-general of the foot. A military government was now e&s;tabli&s;hed, which gave the nation the melancholy pro&s;pect of endle&s;s &s;ervitude, and tyranny without redre&s;s: a &s;uc|cour came to relieve the nation from a quarter on which it was the lea&s;t expected.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, general Monk was at the head of eight thou&s;and veterans in Scotland, and beheld the di&s;traction of his na|tive country with but &s;lender hopes of reliev|ing it. This per&s;onage, to whom the nation owes &s;uch &s;ignal obligations, was at fir&s;t a &s;oldier of fortune. After &s;ome time &s;pent a|broad, he was intru&s;ted with a regiment in the &s;ervice of king Charles, and was u&s;ually called by the &s;oldiery, for his good nature, hone&s;t
<PB N="359" REF="361">
George Monk. He was, however, taken pri|&s;oner at the &s;iege of Nantwich, by Fairfax, and &s;oon after &s;ent to the Tower. He did not re|cover his liberty till after the total overthrow of the royal party, when Cromwell took him into favour and protection, and &s;ent him to op|po&s;e the Iri&s;h rebels, again&s;t whom he peform|ed &s;ignal &s;ervices. Upon the reduction of that kingdom he was &s;ent over into Scotland, and there entru&s;ted with the &s;upreme com|mand, in which &s;tation he was not le&s;s e&s;teem|ed by the Scotch, than loved and adored by his own army.</P>
<P>This general, upon hearing that the officers had, by their own authority, di&s;&s;olved the par|liament, prote&s;ted again&s;t the mea&s;ure, and re&s;olved to defend their invaded privileges. But deeper de&s;igns, either in the king's favour or his own, were &s;u&s;pected to be the motive of his actions from the beginning. What|ever might have been his de&s;igns, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to cover them with greater &s;ecrecy than he did. As &s;oon as he put his army into motion, to enquire into the cau&s;es of the di&s;|turbances in the capital, his countenance was eagerly &s;ought by all the contending par|ties. His own brother, a clergyman, who was a zealous royali&s;t, came to him with a me&s;&s;age
<PB N="360" REF="362">
from lord Granville, in the name of the king. The general a&s;ked him if he had ever com|municated the contents of his commi&s;&s;ion to any other per&s;on. His brother replied, to none except to Mr. Price, the general's own chaplain, a man of probity, and in the royal intere&s;ts. The general altering his counte|nance, at once changed the di&s;cour&s;e, and would enter into no further conference with him. The &s;ame deep re&s;erve was held thro' all his &s;ub&s;equent proceedings.</P>
<P>Hearing that the officers were preparing an army to oppo&s;e him; and that general Lam|bert was actually advancing northward to meet him, Monk &s;ent three commi&s;&s;ioners to Lon|don, with very earne&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of an ac|commodation, by which means he relaxed their preparations. His commi&s;&s;ioners even proceeded &s;o far as to &s;ign a treaty, which he refu&s;ed to ratify. Still, however, he made pro|po&s;als for fre&s;h negociations; and the com|mittee of officers again accepted his fallacious offers.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the people perceiving that they were not entirely defencele&s;s, began to gather &s;pirit, and to exclaim loudly again&s;t the tyranny of the army. Hazlerig, and More|ley, while Lambert was ab&s;ent, took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="361" REF="363">
of Port&s;mouth, and declared for the par|liament. The city apprentices ro&s;e in a tu|mult, and demanded a free parliament. Admi|ral Law&s;on came into the river with his &s;qua|dron, and declared for the parliament; and even the regiments that had been left in Lon|don, being &s;olicited by their old officers, who had been ca&s;hiered, revolted again to the par|liament. The Rump, thus being invited on all hands, again ventured to re&s;ume their &s;eats, and to thunder their votes in turn again&s;t the officers, and that part of the army by which they had been ejected. Without taking any notice of Lambert, they &s;ent orders to the troops he conducted, immediately to re|pair to the garri&s;ons they appointed for them. The &s;oldiers were not &s;low in obeying the par|liamentary orders; and Lambert at la&s;t found him&s;elf de&s;erted by his whole army. He was &s;oon after committed to the Tower; &s;everal of his brother-officers ca&s;hiered, and the par|liament &s;eemed now to &s;tand on a firmer ba&s;is than before.</P>
<P>But they were far from being &s;o &s;ecure as they imagined. Monk, though he had heard of their re&s;titution, and therefore might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have nothing more to do, &s;till continued to march his army towards the ca|pital;
<PB N="362" REF="364">
all the world equally in doubt as to his motives, and a&s;toni&s;hed at his re&s;erve. The gentry, on his march, flocked round him with entreaties and addre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ire of a new parliament. Fairfax brought him a body of troops, with which he offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the work of re&s;toration; but Monk continued his inflexible taciturnity, and at la&s;t came to St. Alban's, within a few miles of London.</P>
<P>He there &s;ent the parliament a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring them to remove &s;uch forces as remain|ed in London to country quarters. With this, &s;ome of the regiments refu&s;ed to comply, but Monk was re&s;olved to be obeyed; he entered London the next day, turned the &s;oldiers out, and, with his army, took up his quarters in We&s;tmin&s;ter. He then waited upon the hou&s;e, which was ready enough to vote him their &s;incere thanks for the &s;ervices he had done his country. But he, in a blunt man|ner, a&s;&s;ured them, that his only merit was a de&s;ire to re&s;tore peace to the community; and, therefore, he entreated them that they would permit a free parliament to be called, as the only balm that could heal the wounds of the con&s;titution. He ob&s;erved al&s;o, that many oaths of admi&s;&s;ion upon this occa&s;ion were un|nece&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="363" REF="365">
and the fewer the obligations of this kind, the clearer would their con&s;ciences be.</P>
<P>The hope of being in&s;olent with &s;ecurity, &s;oon in&s;pired the citizens to refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent government. They re&s;olved to pay no taxes, until the members, formerly excluded by colonel Pride, &s;hould be replac|ed. But the parliament found their general willing to give them the mo&s;t ready in&s;tances of his obedience; he entered the city with his troops, arre&s;ted eleven of the mo&s;t obnoxious of the common-council, and began to de&s;troy the gates. Then he wrote a letter to the par|liament, telling them what he had done; and begging they would moderate the &s;everity of their orders. But being urged by the hou&s;e to proceed, he, with all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances of contempt, broke the gates and port-culli&s;es; and having expo&s;ed the city to the &s;corn and deri&s;ion of all who hated it, he returned in triumph to his quarters in We&s;tmin&s;ter. But the next day he began to think he had pro|ceeded too vigorou&s;ly in this act of obedience; he therefore marched into the city again, and de|&s;ired the mayor to call a common-council, where he made many apologies for his conduct the day before. He a&s;&s;ured them of his per&s;everance in the cau&s;e of freedom; and that his army
<PB N="364" REF="366">
would, for the future, co-operate only in &s;uch &s;chemes as they &s;hould approve.</P>
<P>This union of the city and the army cau&s;ed no &s;mall alarm in the hou&s;e of commons. They knew that a free and general parliament was de&s;ired by the whole nation; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e, they were convinced that their own power mu&s;t have an end. But their fears of puni&s;hment were &s;till greater than their un|ea&s;ine&s;s at di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; they had been in&s;tru|mental in bringing their king to the block, in loading the nation with various taxes, and &s;ome of them had grown rich by the common plunder; they re&s;olved, therefore, to try every method to gain off the general from his new alliance; even &s;ome of them, de&s;perate with guilt and fanatici&s;m, promi&s;ed to inve&s;t him with the dignity of &s;upreme magi&s;trate, and to &s;upport his u&s;urpation. But Monk was too ju&s;t, or too wi&s;e to hearken to &s;uch wild propo&s;als; he re&s;olved to re&s;tore the &s;ecluded members, and by their means to bring about a new election, which was what he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>There was no other method to effect this, but by force of arms: wherefore, having previou&s;|ly &s;ecured the con&s;ent of his officers, and exact|ed a promi&s;e from the excluded members, that they would call a full and free parliament, he
<PB N="365" REF="367">
accompanied them to Whitehall. From thence, with a numerous guard, he conducted them to the hou&s;e of commons, the other members of which were then &s;itting. They were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a large body of men entering the place; but &s;oon recollected them for their ancient bre|thren, who had been formerly tumultuou&s;ly expelled, and were now as tumultuou&s;ly re|&s;tored. The number of the new comers was &s;o &s;uperior to that of the rump, that the chiefs of this la&s;t party now, in their turn, thought proper to withdraw.</P>
<P>The re&s;tored members began by repealing all tho&s;e orders by which they had been ex|cluded. They renewed and enlarged the ge|neral's commi&s;&s;ion; they fixed a proper &s;ti|pend for the &s;upport of the fleet and the army; and having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e votes for the compo|&s;ure of the kingdom, they di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves, and gave orders for the immediate a&s;&s;embling a new parliament. Mean while Monk new modelled his army to the purpo&s;es he had in view. Some officers, by his direction, pre|&s;ented him with an addre&s;s, in which they promi&s;ed to obey implicitly the orders of the en&s;uing parliament. He approved of this en|gagement, which he ordered to be &s;igned by all the different regiments; and this furni&s;hed
<PB N="366" REF="368">
him with a pretence for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all the of|ficers by whom it was rejected.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions his en|deavours were very near being defeated by an accident as dangerous as unexpected. Lam|bert had e&s;caped from the Tower, and began to a&s;&s;emble forces; and as his activity and principles were &s;ufficiently known, Monk took the earlie&s;t precautions to oppo&s;e his mea&s;ures. He di&s;patched colonel Ingold&s;by with his own regiment again&s;t Lambert, before he &s;hould have time to a&s;&s;emble his dependents. That officer had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Daventry with four troops of hor&s;e; but the greater part of them joined Ingold&s;by, to whom he him&s;elf &s;urrendered, not without exhibiting marks of pu&s;illanimity, that ill agreed with his former reputation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="A.D."> As yet the new parliament was not a&s;&s;em|bled, and no per&s;on had hitherto dived into the de&s;igns of the general. He &s;till per&s;e|vered in his re&s;erve; and although the call|ing a new parliament was but, in other words, to re&s;tore the king, yet his expre&s;&s;ions never once betrayed the &s;ecret of his bo&s;om. No|thing but a &s;ecurity of confidence at la&s;t ex|torted the confe&s;&s;ion from him. He had been intimate with one Morrice, a gentleman of
<PB N="367" REF="369">
Devon&s;hire, of a &s;edentary &s;tudious di&s;po&s;i|tion, and with him alone did he deliberate upon the great and dangerous enterprize of the re&s;toration. Sir John Granville, who had a commi&s;&s;ion from the king, applied for ac|ce&s;s to the general; but he was de&s;ired to communicate his bu&s;ine&s;s to Morrice. Gran|ville refu&s;ed, though twice urged, to deliver his me&s;&s;age to any but the general him&s;elf; &s;o that Monk now finding he could depend upon this mini&s;ter's &s;ecrecy, he opened to him his whole intentions; but with his u&s;ual cau|tion &s;till &s;crupled to commit any thing to pa|per. In con&s;equence of the&s;e the king left the Spani&s;h territories, where he very nar|rowly e&s;caped being detained at Breda by the governor, under pretence of treating him with proper re&s;pect and formality. From thence he retired into Holland, where he re&s;olved to wait for further advice.</P>
<P>In the mean time the elections in parlia|ment went every where in favour of the king's party. The pre&s;byterians had long been &s;o harra&s;&s;ed by the fal&s;hood, the folly, and the tyranny of their independent coadjutors, that they longed, for nothing &s;o ardently as the king's re&s;toration. The&s;e, therefore, joined to the royali&s;ts, formed a deci&s;ive majority on
<PB N="368" REF="370">
every conte&s;t, and without noi&s;e, but with &s;teddy re&s;olution, determined to call back the king. Though the former parliament had voted that no one &s;hould be elected, who had him&s;elf, or who&s;e father had borne arms for the late king, yet very little regard was any where paid to this ordinance; and in many places the former &s;ufferings of the candidate were his be&s;t recommendation.</P>
<P>At length the long expected day for the &s;it|ting of a free parliament arrived; and they cho&s;e Sir Harbottle Grim&s;tone for their &s;peaker, a man, though at fir&s;t attached to the oppo&s;ing party, yet a royali&s;t in his heart. The affections of all were turned towards the king; yet &s;uch were their fears, and &s;uch dan|gers attended a freedom of &s;peech, that no one dared for &s;ome days to make any mention of his name. They were terrified with former examples of cruelty; and they only &s;hewed their loyalty in their bitter invectives again&s;t the late u&s;urper, and in execrations again&s;t the murder|ers of their king. All this time Monk, with his u&s;ual re&s;erve, tried their tempers, and ex|amined the ardour of their wi&s;hes; at length he gave directions to Anne&s;ley, pre&s;ident of the council, to inform them that one Sir John Granville, a &s;ervant of the king's, had been
<PB N="369" REF="371">
&s;ent over by his maje&s;ty, and was now at the door with a letter to the commons.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy and tran&s;port with which this me&s;&s;age was received. The members for a moment forgot the dignity of their &s;ituations, and indulged in a loud excla|mation of applau&s;e. Granville was called in, and the letter eagerly read. A moment's pau&s;e was &s;carce allowed; all at once the hou&s;e bur&s;t out into an univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent at the king's propo&s;als; and to diffu&s;e the joy more widely, it was voted that the letter and decla|ration &s;hould immediately be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The king's declaration was highly reli&s;hed by every order of the &s;tate. It offered a ge|neral amne&s;ty to all per&s;ons what&s;oever, and that without any exceptions, but &s;uch as &s;hould be made by parliament. It promi&s;ed to indulge &s;crupulous con&s;ciences with liberty in matters of religion; to leave to the exami|nation of parliament the claims of all &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lands with conte&s;ted titles; to con|firm all the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions by act of parliament; to &s;atisfy the army under general Monk with re&s;pect to their arrears, and to give the &s;ame rank to his officers when they &s;hould be re|ceived into the king's &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="372">This declaration was not le&s;s plea&s;ing to the lords than to the people. After voting the re|&s;titution of the ancient form of government, it was re&s;olved to &s;end the king fifty thou&s;and pounds, the duke of York his brother ten thou&s;and, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter half that &s;um. Then both hou&s;es era&s;ed from their records all acts that had pa&s;&s;ed to the preju|dice of royalty. The army, the navy, the city of London, were eager in preparing their addre&s;&s;es to be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty; and he was &s;oon after proclaimed with great &s;o|lemnity at Whitehall, and at Temple Bar. The people, now freed from all re&s;traint, let loo&s;e their tran&s;ports without bounds. Thou|&s;ands were &s;een running about frantic with plea&s;ure; and, as lord Clarendon &s;ays, &s;uch were the numbers of the loyali&s;ts that pre&s;&s;ed forward on this occa&s;ion, that one could not but wonder where tho&s;e people dwelt who had lately done &s;o much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Charles took care to confirm the &s;ub&s;tance of his declarations to the Engli&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners, who were di&s;patched to attend him into his native dominions. Montague, the Eng|li&s;h admiral, waited upon his maje&s;ty to in|form him that the fleet expected his orders at Scheveling. The duke of York immediately
<PB N="371" REF="373">
went on board, and took the command as lord high-admiral. The king went on board, and landing at Dover, was received by the ge|neral, whom he tenderly embraced. Very different was his pre&s;ent triumphant return from the forlorn &s;tate in which he left the Engli&s;h coa&s;t at Su&s;&s;ex. He now &s;aw the &s;ame people that had ardently &s;ought his life, as warmly expre&s;&s;ing their plea&s;ure at his &s;afe|ty, and repentance for their pa&s;t delu&s;ions. He entered London on the twenty-ninth of May, which was his birth-day. An innu|merable concour&s;e of people lined the way wherever he pa&s;&s;ed, and rent the air with their acclamations. They had been &s;o long di&s;|tracted by unrelenting factions, oppre&s;&s;ed and alarmed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrannies, that they could no longer &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e emotions of de|light to behold their con&s;titution re&s;tored; or rather, like a phoenix, appearing more beau|tiful and vigorous from the ruins of its former conflagration.</P>
<P>Fanatici&s;m, with its long train of gloomy terrors, fled at the approach of freedom; the arts of &s;ociety and peace began to return; and it had been happy for the people if the arts of luxury had not entered in their train.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXXV. CHARLES II.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary epochas in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, in which we &s;ee the people to&s;&s;ed into oppo&s;ite factions, and, as the &s;ea after a &s;torm, &s;till continuing tho&s;e vio|lent motions by which they were fir&s;t impelled. We &s;ee them at one period of the following reign, with unbounded adulation &s;olliciting the &s;hackles of arbitrary power; at another,
<PB N="373" REF="375">
with equal animo&s;ity bani&s;hing all the emi&s;|&s;aries of unbounded power from the throne; now courting the monarch, and then threat|ening tho&s;e on whom he mo&s;t depended. There &s;eems a clue that can unravel all the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies. While the people thought the king a prote&s;tant, they were willing to entru&s;t him with their lives and fortunes; but when they &s;uppo&s;ed that he was more inclining to popery, all their confidence vani&s;hed, and they were even willing to puni&s;h papi&s;ts, as the propere&s;t method of &s;hewing their re&s;ent|ment again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Charles came to the throne he was thirty years of age, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an agreeable per&s;on, an elegant addre&s;s, and an engaging manner. His whole demeanor and be|haviour was well calculated to &s;upport and encrea&s;e popularity. Accu&s;tomed during his exile to live chearfully among his cour|tiers, he carried the &s;ame endearing fami|liarities to the throne; and from the levity of his temper no injuries were dreaded from his former re&s;entments. But it was &s;oon found that all the&s;e advantages were merely &s;uperfi|cial. His indolence and love of plea&s;ure made him aver&s;e to all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s; his fami|liarities were pro&s;tituted to the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t of his &s;ubjects; and he took no
<PB N="374" REF="376">
care to reward his former friends, as he had taken no &s;teps to be avenged of his former enemies.</P>
<P>It required &s;ome time before the &s;everal parts of the &s;tate, disfigured by war and faction, could come into proper form; a council was compo&s;ed, into which church of England men and pre&s;byterians indi&s;criminately were admit|ed; and the king's choice of his principal mini&s;|ters was univer&s;ally plea&s;ing to the people. Sir Edward Hyde, who had attended him in his exile, was now created a peer by the title of lord Clarendon, and appointed lord-chancel|lor, and fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate. This excel|lent man is better known now by his merits as an hi&s;torian, than as a &s;tate&s;man; but his in|tegrity and wi&s;dom were equally excellent in both. The marquis, afterwards created duke of Ormond, was appointed lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;hold, the earl of Southampton high trea|&s;urer, and Sir Edward Nicholas &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The&s;e men, combined by private friend|&s;hip, and pur&s;uing one common aim, laboured only for the public, and &s;upported its inter|e&s;ts with their own.</P>
<P>But though the joy of the people was unbounded, yet &s;omething was thought to be due to ju&s;tice, and &s;ome vengeance was nece&s;&s;ary to be taken upon tho&s;e who had
<PB N="375" REF="377">
lately involved the nation in its calami|ties. Though an act of indemnity was pa&s;&s;|ed, tho&s;e who had an immediate hand in the king's death were excepted. Even Crom|well, Ireton, and Brad&s;haw, though dead, were con&s;idered as proper objects of re&s;ent|ment; their bodies were dug from their graves, dragged to the place of execution, and, after hanging &s;ome time, buried under the gallows. Of the re&s;t, who &s;at in judgment on the late monarch's trial, &s;ome were dead, and &s;ome were thought worthy of pardon. Ten only, out of four&s;core, were devoted to immediate de&s;truction. The&s;e were enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who had all along acted from principle, and who, in the general &s;pirit of rage excited again&s;t them, &s;hewed a fortitude that might do honour to a better cau&s;e.</P>
<P>General Harri&s;on, who was fir&s;t brought to his trial, pleaded his cau&s;e with that undaunted firmne&s;s which he had &s;hewn through life. What he had done, he &s;aid, was from the im|pul&s;es of the &s;pirit of God. He would not, for any benefit to him&s;elf, hurt an hair of the poore&s;t man or woman upon earth; and dur|ing the u&s;urpation of Cromwell, when all the re&s;t of the world acknowledged his right, or bowed down to his power, he had boldly up|braided
<PB N="376" REF="378">
the u&s;urper to his face; and all the terrors of impri&s;onment, and all the allure|ments of ambition, had not been able to bend him to a compliance to that deceitful tyrant. Harri&s;on's death was marked with the &s;ame admirable con&s;tancy which he &s;hewed at his his trial; &s;o that the greatne&s;s of &s;ome vir|tues which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure coun|terbalanced the greatne&s;s of his guilt.</P>
<P>Carew, Coke, Peters, Scot, Clement, Scrope, Jones, Hacker, and Axtel, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. They bore the &s;corn of the multitude, and the cruelty of the executioner, not &s;imply with fortitude, but with the &s;pirit and confi|dence of martyrs, who &s;uffered for having done their duty. Some circum&s;tances of &s;can|dalous barbarity attended their execution. Har|ri&s;on's entrails were torn out, and thrown into the fire before he expired. His head was fixed on the &s;ledge that drew Coke and Peters to the place of execution, with the face turned towards them. The executioner having mang|led Coke approached Peters, be&s;meared with the blood of his friend, and a&s;ked how he liked that work. Peters viewed him with an air of &s;corn:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have butchered a &s;ervant of God in my &s;ight; but I defy your cruelty."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="379">This was all the blood that was &s;hed in &s;o great a re&s;toration. The re&s;t of the king's judges were reprieved, and afterwards di&s;|per&s;ed into &s;everal pri&s;ons. Charles being di|rected in all things by Clarendon, gave uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction as well by the lenity as the ju&s;tice of his conduct. The army was di&s;|banded that had for &s;o many years governed the nation; prelacy, and all the ceremonies of the church of England, were re&s;tored; at the &s;ame time that the king pretended to pre&s;erve an air of moderation and neutrality. In fact, with regard to religion, Charles, in his gayer hours, was a profe&s;&s;ed dei&s;t, and attached to none; but in the latter part of his life, when he began to think more &s;eriou&s;ly, he &s;hewed an inclination to the catholic per&s;ua&s;ion, which he had &s;trongly imbibed in his exile.</P>
<P>But this toleration, in which all were equally included, was not able to remove the fears, or quell the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a few de&s;perate men, who, by an unexampled combination, were impelled by one common phrenzy. One Ven|ner, a de&s;perate enthu&s;ia&s;t, who had often con&s;pired again&s;t Cromwell, and had as often been pardoned, had by this time per&s;uaded his followers, that if they would take arms, Je&s;us would come to put him&s;elf at their head.
<PB N="378" REF="380">
With the&s;e expectations, to the number of &s;ixty per&s;ons, they i&s;&s;ued forth into the &s;treets of London in complete armour, and proclaim|ed king Je&s;us where ever they went. They believed them&s;elves invulnerable and invinci|ble, and expected the &s;ame fortune which had attended Gideon, and the other heroes of the Old Te&s;tament. Every one at fir&s;t fled before them; one unhappy man being a&s;ked who he was for, an&s;wering that he was for God and the king, they &s;lew him upon the &s;pot. In this manner they went from &s;treet to &s;treet, and made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t a body of the train bands that was &s;ent to attack them. After killing many of the a&s;&s;ailants, they made a regular retreat into Cane wood, near Hamp|&s;tead. Being di&s;lodged from thence, the next morning they returned to London, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hou&s;e, in which they defended them&s;elves again&s;t a body of troops, until the majority was killed. At la&s;t the troops, who had untiled the hou&s;e, and were tired of &s;laugh|ter, ru&s;hed in, and &s;eized the few that were left alive. They were tried, condemned, and executed; and to the la&s;t they declared, that if they were deceived, it was the Lord him&s;elf that was their deceiver.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity, and even ridicule which at|tended the profe&s;&s;ions and expectation of the&s;e
<PB N="379" REF="381">
poor deluded men, &s;truck the people very &s;trongly; and from the gloomy moro&s;ene&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m, they now went over into the oppo|&s;ite extreme of riot and debauchery. The court it&s;elf &s;et them the example; nothing but &s;cenes of gallantry and fe&s;tivity were to be &s;een; the horrors of the late war were become the &s;ubject of ridicule; the formality and ig|norance of the &s;ectaries were di&s;played upon the &s;tage, and even laughed at from the pul|pit. But while the king thus rioted, the old faithful friends and followers of his family were left unrewarded. Numbers who had fought for him and his father, and had lo&s;t their whole fortunes in his &s;ervice, &s;till con|tinued to pine in want and oblivion. While, in the mean time, their per&s;ecutors, who had profited by the times, had acquired fortunes during the civil war, and were &s;till permitted to enjoy them without mole&s;tation. The &s;uf|ferers petitioned in vain: the family of the Stuarts were never remarkable for their grati|tude; and the amu&s;ers, the flatterers, and the concubines of this monarch, enjoyed all his con&s;ideration. The wretched royali&s;ts mur|mured without redre&s;s; he fled from their gloomy expo&s;tulations to &s;cenes of mirth, riot, and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="382">Neverthele&s;s his parliaments, both of Eng|land and Scotland, &s;eemed willing to make reparation for their former di&s;obedience, by their pre&s;ent conce&s;&s;ions.<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="A.D."> In the Engli&s;h hou&s;e, monarchy and epi&s;copacy were carried to as great &s;plendour, as they had &s;uffered mi&s;ery and depre&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hops were per|mitted to re&s;ume their &s;eats in the hou&s;e of peers; all military authority was acknowledg|ed to be ve&s;ted in the king; and he was em|powered to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for regula|ting corporations, and expelling &s;uch mem|bers as had intruded them&s;elves by violence, or profe&s;&s;ed principles dangerous to the con&s;ti|tution. An act of uniformity in religion was pa&s;&s;ed, by which it was required that every clergyman &s;hould be re-ordained, if he had not before received epi&s;copal ordination; that he &s;hould declare his a&s;&s;ent to every thing con|tained in the Book of Common Prayer, and &s;hould take the oath of canonical obedience. In con&s;equence of this law, above two thou|&s;and of the pre&s;byterian clergy relinqui&s;hed their cures in one day, to the great a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the nation; thus &s;acrificing their in|tere&s;t to their religion.</P>
<P>But the Scotch parliament went &s;till greater lengths in their pro&s;trations to the king. It was
<PB N="381" REF="383">
there that his divine, indefea&s;ible, and heredi|tary right, was a&s;&s;erted in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive terms. His right was extended to their lives and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and from his original grant was &s;aid to come all that his &s;ubjects might be &s;aid to enjoy. They voted him an additional reve|nue of forty thou&s;and pounds; and all their for|mer violences were treated with a degree of the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>This was the time for the king to have made him&s;elf independent of all parliaments; and it is &s;aid that Southampton, one of his mini&s;ters, had thought of procuring his ma&s;ter from the commons the grant of a revenue of two millions a year, which would effectually render him ab&s;olute; but in this his views were ob&s;tructed by the great Clarendon, who, tho' attached to the king, was &s;till more the friend of liberty and the laws. Charles, however, was no way intere&s;ted in the&s;e oppo&s;ite views of his mini&s;ters; he only de&s;ired money, in order to pro&s;ecute his plea&s;ures; and provid|ed he had that, he little regarded the manner in which it was obtained.</P>
<P>It was this carele&s;s and expen&s;ive di&s;po&s;i|tion that fir&s;t tended to di&s;gu&s;t his &s;ubjects, and to di&s;pel that intoxication of loyalty, which had taken place at his re&s;toration. Tho'
<PB N="382" REF="384">
the people were plea&s;ed with the mirth and plea&s;antry of their monarch, yet they could not help murmuring at his indolence; his de|baucheries, and profu&s;ion. They could not help remembering the &s;trict frugality and active diligence that marked the u&s;urper's ad|mini&s;tration; they called to mind the victories they had gained under him, and the va&s;t pro|jects he had undertaken. But they now &s;aw an oppo&s;ite picture; a court &s;unk in debauch|ery, and they taxes of the nation only employ|ed in extending vice, and corrupting the morals of the people. The ejected clergy did not fail to enflame the&s;e ju&s;t re&s;entments in the minds of the audience; but particularly when the nation &s;aw Dunkirk, which had been acquired during the late vigorous admini&s;tra|tion, now ba&s;ely &s;old to the French, for a &s;mall &s;um to &s;upply the king's extragance, they could put no bounds to their complaints. From this time,<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="A.D."> he found the wheels of go|vernment clogged with continual ob&s;tructions, and his parliaments reluctantly granting tho&s;e &s;upplies, which he as meanly conde&s;cended to implore.</P>
<P>His continual exigences drove him con|&s;tantly to mea&s;ures no way &s;uited to his incli|nation. Among others, was his marriage, cele|brated
<PB N="383" REF="385">
at this time with Catharine, the Infanta of Portugal, who, though a virtuous prince&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as it &s;hould &s;eem but few per&s;onal attractions. It was the portion of this prin|ce&s;s that the needy monarch was enamoured of, which amounted to three hundred thou&s;and pounds, together with the fortre&s;s of Tangier in Africa, and of Bombay in the Ea&s;t Indies. The chancellor Clarendon, the dukes of Or|mond, and Southampton, urged many rea&s;ons again&s;t this match, particularly the likelihood of her never having any children; the king di&s;re|garded their advice, and the inau&s;picious mar|riage was celebrated accordingly.</P>
<P>But &s;till his nece&s;&s;ities were greater than his &s;upplies. He never much loved the &s;teady virtue of lord Clarendon, and imputed to him &s;ome of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities to which he was redu|ced. It is &s;aid al&s;o that this great mini&s;ter prevented him from repudiating the queen, which he had thoughts of doing, in order to marry one Mrs. Stuart, on whom he had pla|ced his affections, by procuring that lady to be privately married to the duke of Rich|mond. However this be, he was now willing to give him up to the re&s;entment of the par|liament, to whom he was become obnoxious, in order to obtain &s;ome farther &s;upplies. For
<PB N="384" REF="386">
this purpo&s;e he a&s;&s;embled the commons in the Banquetting-hou&s;e; and, in the clo&s;e of a flat|tering &s;peech, replete with profe&s;&s;ions of eter|nal gratitude, and the warme&s;t affection, he begged a &s;upply for his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, which he &s;aid were extremely pre&s;&s;ing. They could not re&s;i&s;t his humble &s;upplications; they granted him four &s;ub&s;idies; and the clergy, in convocation, followed their example. On this occa&s;ion lord Bri&s;tol ventured to impeach the chancellor in the hou&s;e of peers; but not &s;up|porting his charge for this time, the affair dropped, only in order to be revived again the next &s;e&s;&s;ions with greater animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was probably with a view of recruiting the &s;upply for his plea&s;ures, that he was in|duced to declare war again&s;t the Dutch, as the money appointed for that purpo&s;e, would go through his hands. A vote, by his contri|vance, was procured in the hou&s;e of commons, alledging, that the wrongs, affronts, and in|dignities offered by the Dutch in &s;everal quar|ters of the globe, had in a great mea&s;ure ob|&s;tructed the trade of the nation. This was enough for his maje&s;ty to proceed upon. As his prodigality always kept him nece&s;&s;itous, he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould be able to convert a part of the &s;upplies to his private amu&s;e|ments.
<PB N="385" REF="387">
His brother al&s;o, the duke of York, longed for an opportunity of &s;ignalizing his courage and conduct, as high admiral, again&s;t a people he hated, not only for their republi|can principles, but al&s;o as being one of the chief bulwarks of the prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>This war began on each &s;ide with mutual depredations. The Engli&s;h, under the com|mand of Sir Robert Holmes, not only expell|ed the Dutch from Cape Cor&s;e ca&s;tle, on the coa&s;t of Africa, but likewi&s;e &s;eized the Dutch &s;ettlements of Cape Verde, and the I&s;le of Goree. Sailing from thence to America, the admiral po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Nova Belgia, &s;ince called New York; a country that has &s;ince continued annexed to the Engli&s;h government. On the other hand, de Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, &s;ailed to Guinea, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h of all their &s;ettlements there, except Cape Cor&s;e. He then &s;ailed to America, attacked Barba|does, but was repul&s;ed. He afterwards com|mitted ho&s;tilities on Long I&s;land. Soon after, the two mo&s;t con&s;iderable fleets of each na|tion met, the one under the duke of York, to the number of an hundred and fourteen &s;ail, the other commanded by Opdam, admi|ral of the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force. The engagement began at four in the morn|ing,
<PB N="386" REF="388">
and both &s;ides fought with their u&s;ual in|trepidity. The duke of York was in the hot|te&s;t part of the engagement, and behaved with great &s;pirit and compo&s;ure, while his lords and attendants were killed be&s;ide him. In the heat of the action, when engaged in clo&s;e fight with the duke, the Dutch admiral's &s;hip blew up: this accident much di&s;couraged the Dutch, who fled towards their own coa&s;t; they had nineteen &s;hips &s;unk and taken, the victors lo&s;t only one. This di&s;a&s;ter threw the Dutch into con&s;ternation; and de Wit, their great mini&s;ter, who&s;e genius and wi&s;dom were admirable, was obliged to come on board, and take the command of the fleet upon him&s;elf. This extraordinary man quickly became as much ma&s;ter of naval affairs, as if he had been from his infancy educated in them. He even improved &s;ome parts of the naval art, beyond what expert mariners had ever expected to attain.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h naturally excited the jealou&s;y of the neighbouring &s;tates, par|ticularly France and Denmark, who re&s;olved to protect the Dutch again&s;t the &s;uperior power of their oppo&s;ers. The Dutch, being thus &s;trengthened by &s;o powerful an alliance, re|&s;olved to face their conquerors once more.
<PB N="387" REF="389">
De Ruyter, their great admiral, was returned from his expedition to Guinea; and was ap|pointed, at the head of &s;eventy-&s;ix &s;ail, to join the duke of Beaufort, the French admiral, who, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was then entering the Briti&s;h channel from Toulon. The duke of Albemarle and prince Rupert now commanded the Eng|li&s;h fleet, which did not exceed &s;eventy-four &s;ail. Albemarle, who from his &s;ucce&s;&s;es un|der Cromwell had learned too much to de&s;|pi&s;e the enemy, propo&s;ed to detach prince Ru|pert with twenty &s;hips to oppo&s;e the duke of Beaufort. Sir George Ay&s;cue, well acquaint|ed with the force of his enemies, prote&s;ted again&s;t the temerity of this re&s;olution; but Albemarle's authority prevailed. The Eng|li&s;h and Dutch, thus engaging upon unequal terms, a battle en&s;ued, the mo&s;t memorable in the annals of the ocean. The battle began with incredible fury: the Dutch admiral Evertzen was killed by a cannon ball, and one ve&s;&s;el of their fleet was blown up, while one of the Engli&s;h &s;hips was taken: darkne&s;s parted the combatants for the fir&s;t day. The &s;econd day they renewed the combat with encrea&s;ed ani|mo&s;ity; &s;ixteen fre&s;h &s;hips joined the Dutch, and the Engli&s;h were &s;o &s;hattered, that their fighting &s;hips were reduced to twenty-eight.
<PB N="388" REF="390">
Upon retreating towards their own coa&s;t, the Dutch followed them, where another dreadful conflict was beginning, but parted by the dark|ne&s;s of the night as before. The morning of the third day, the Engli&s;h were obliged to conti|nue their retreat, and the Dutch per&s;i&s;ted in pur&s;uing. Albemarle, who &s;till kept in the rear, and pre&s;ented a dreadful front to the enemy, made a de&s;perate re&s;olution to blow up his &s;hip rather than &s;ubmit to the enemy; when he happily found him&s;elf reinforced by prince Rupert with &s;ixteen &s;hips of the line. By this time it was night; and the next morn|ing, after a di&s;tant cannonading, the fleets came to a clo&s;e combat, which was continued with great violence, till they were parted by a mi&s;t. Sir George Ay&s;cue, in a &s;hip of one hundred guns, had the misfortune to &s;trike on the Galoper Sands, where he was &s;urrounded and taken. The Engli&s;h retired fir&s;t into their harbours; both &s;ides claimed the victory, but the Dutch certainly obtained the advantage, though not the glory of the combat.</P>
<P>A &s;econd engagement, equally bloody, fol|lowed &s;oon after, with larger fleets on both &s;ides, commanded by the &s;ame admirals; and in this the Dutch were obliged to own them|&s;elves vanqui&s;hed, and retreat into their own
<PB N="389" REF="391">
harbours. But they &s;oon were in a capacity to out-number the Engli&s;h fleet, by the junc|tion of Beaufort the French admiral. The Dutch fleet appeared in the Thames, con|ducted by their great admiral; and threw the Engli&s;h into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation: a chain had been drawn acro&s;s the river Medway; &s;ome fortifications had been added to the forts along the banks, but all the&s;e were unequal to the pre&s;ent force: Sheerne&s;s was &s;oon taken, the Dutch pa&s;&s;ed forward, and broke the chain, though fortified by &s;ome &s;hips, &s;unk there by Albemarle's orders. De&s;troying the &s;hipping in their pa&s;&s;age, they advanced &s;till onward, with &s;ix men of war, and five fire-&s;hips, as far as Upnore ca&s;tle, where they burned three men of war. The whole city of London was in con&s;ternation; it was expected that the Dutch might fail up next tide to London bridge, and de&s;troy, not only the &s;hipping, but even the buildings of the metropolis. But the Dutch were unable to pro&s;ecute that pro|ject, from the failure of the French, who had promi&s;ed to give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;preading, therefore, an alarm along the coa&s;t, and having in&s;ulted Norwich, they returned to their own ports, to boa&s;t their in&s;ult on the Briti&s;h glory.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="392"><MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="A.D."> Nothing could exceed the indignation felt by the people at this di&s;grace. But they had lately &s;u&s;tained &s;ome accidental calamities, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure moderated their rage and their pride. A plague had ravaged the city the year before, which &s;wept away more than an hundred thou&s;and of its inhabitants. This calamity was &s;oon after followed by an|other &s;till more dreadful, as more unexpected: a fire breaking out at a baker's hou&s;e, who lived in Pudding-lane, near the bridge, it &s;pread with &s;uch rapidity, that no efforts could extingui&s;h it till it laid in a&s;hes the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable party of the city. The conflagration continued three days; while the wretched in|habitants fled from one &s;treet, only to be &s;pec|tators of equal calamities in another. At length, when all hope vani&s;hed, and a total de&s;truction was expected, the flames cea&s;ed unexpectedly, after having reduced thou&s;ands from affluence to mi&s;ery. As the &s;treets were narrow, and mo&s;tly built of wood, the flames &s;pread the fa&s;ter; and the unu&s;ual dryne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on prevented the proper &s;upplies of water. But the people were not &s;atisfied with the&s;e obvious motives; having been long taught to impute their calamities to the ma|chinations of their enemies, they now a&s;cribed
<PB N="391" REF="393">
the pre&s;ent misfortune to the &s;ame cau&s;e, and imputed the burning of the city to a plot laid by the papi&s;ts. But happily for that &s;ect, no proofs were brought of their guilt, though all men were willing to credit them. The magi&s;tracy, therefore, contented them&s;elves with a&s;cribing it to them, on a monument rai&s;|ed where the fire began; and which &s;till con|tinues as a proof of the blind credulity of the times. This calamity, though at fir&s;t it af|fected the fortunes of thou&s;ands, in the end proved both beneficial and ornamental to the city. It ro&s;e from its ruins in greater beauty than ever; and the &s;treets being widened, and built of brick in&s;tead of wood, became thus more whole&s;ome and more &s;ecure.</P>
<P>The&s;e complicated misfortunes did not fail to excite many murmurs among the people; fearful of laying the blame on the king, who&s;e authority was formidable, they very li|berally a&s;cribed all their calamities to papi&s;ts, je&s;uits, and fanatics. The war again&s;t the Dutch was exclaimed again&s;t, as un&s;ucce&s;sful and unnece&s;&s;ary; as being an attempt to hum|ble that nation, who were equal enemies of popery with them&s;elves. Charles him&s;elf al&s;o began to be &s;en&s;ible that all the ends for which he had undertaken the Dutch war, were like|ly
<PB N="392" REF="394">
to prove entirely ineffectual. Whatever projects he might have formed for &s;ecreting the money granted him by parliament for his own u&s;e, he had hitherto failed in his inten|tion; and in&s;tead of laying up, he found him|&s;elf con&s;iderably in debt. Propo&s;als were, therefore, thrown out for an accommodation, which, after &s;ome negociation, the Dutch con|&s;ented to accept. A treaty was concluded at Breda, by which the colony of New York was ceded by the Dutch to the Engli&s;h, and has continued a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this treaty, it was con|&s;idered as inglorious to the Engli&s;h, as they failed in gaining any redre&s;s upon the com|plaints which gave ri&s;e to it. Lord Claren|don, therefore, gained a &s;hare of blame, both for having fir&s;t advi&s;ed an unnece&s;&s;ary war, and then for concluding a di&s;graceful peace. He had been long declining in the king's fa|vour, and he was no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to the majority of the people. His &s;evere virtue, his uncomplying temper, and his dete&s;tation of factious mea&s;ures, were unlikely to gain him many partizans in &s;uch a court as that of Charles, that had been taught to regard every thing &s;erious as &s;omewhat criminal. There
<PB N="393" REF="395">
were many accu&s;ations now therefore brought up again&s;t him; the &s;ale of Dunkirk, the bad pay|ment of the &s;eamen, and di&s;grace at Chatham, were all added to the accumulation of his guilt. But particularly his imputed ambition was urged among his crimes. His daughter had, while yet in Paris, commenced an amour with the duke of York; and had permitted his gallan|tries to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of virtue. Charles, who then loved Clarendon, and who was un|willing that he &s;hould &s;uffer the mortification of a parent, obliged the duke to marry his daugh|ter; and this marriage, which was ju&s;t in it&s;elf, be|came culpable in the mini&s;ter. A building like|wi&s;e of more expence than his &s;lender fortune could afford, had been undertaken by him; and this was regarded as a &s;tructure rai&s;ed by the plunder of the public. Fewer accu&s;ations than the&s;e would have been &s;ufficient to di&s;grace him with Charles; he ordered the &s;eals to be taken from him, and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed the &s;ignal for Clarendon's ene|mies to &s;tep in, and effect his entire overthrow. The hou&s;e of commons, in their addre&s;s to the king, gave him thanks for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of that nobleman; and immediately a charge was opened again&s;t him in the hou&s;e, by Mr. Sey|mour,
<PB N="394" REF="396">
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen articles. The&s;e, which were only a catalogue of the popular rumours before-mentioned, appeared at fir&s;t &s;ight fal&s;e or frivolous. However Clarendon finding the popular torrent, united to the vio|lence of power, running with impetuo&s;ity again&s;t him, thought proper to withdraw to France. The legi&s;lature then pa&s;&s;ed a bill of bani&s;hment and incapacity, while Clarendon continued to re&s;ide in a private manner at Paris, where he employed his lei&s;ure in reducing his hi&s;tory of the civil war into form, for which he had before collected materials.</P>
<P>A confederacy of great importance, which goes by the name of the Triple Alliance, was formed by Charles, &s;oon after the fall of this great &s;tate&s;man, as if to &s;hew that he could &s;till &s;upply his place. It was conducted by Sir William Temple, one of the great ornaments of Engli&s;h literature; who united the philo&s;o|pher and the &s;tate&s;man, and was equally great in both. This alliance was formed between England, Holland, and Sweden, to prevent the French king from completing his con|que&s;ts in the Netherlands. That monarch had already &s;ubdued the greater part of that delightful country; when he was unexpectedly &s;topped in the mid&s;t of his career by this league;
<PB N="395" REF="397">
in which it was agreed by the contracting powers, that they would con&s;titute them&s;elves arbiters of the differences between France and Spain, and check the inordinate preten&s;ions of ei|ther.</P>
<P>To this foreign confederacy &s;ucceeded one of a dome&s;tic nature, that did not promi&s;e &s;uch beneficial effects as the former. The king had long been fluctuating between his pride and his plea&s;ures; the one urged him to extend his prerogative, the other to enjoy the good things that fortune threw in his way. He therefore would be likely to find the great|e&s;t &s;atisfaction in tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who could flatter both his wi&s;hes at once. He was ex|cited by the active &s;pirit of his brother, to ri&s;e above humble &s;olicitations to his parliament; and was be&s;et by &s;ome de&s;perate coun&s;ellors, who importuned and encouraged him to a&s;&s;ert his own independence. The principal of tho&s;e were, Clifford, A&s;hley, Buckingham, Arling|ton, Lauderdale, a junto di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of the Cabal, a word containing the initial letters of their names. Never was there a more dangerous mini&s;try in England, nor one more fitted to de&s;troy all that liberty which had been e&s;tabli&s;hing for ages.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="398">Sir Thomas Clifford, was a man of a daring and impetuous &s;pirit, rendered more danger|ous by eloquence and intrigue. Lord A&s;hley, &s;oon after known by the name of lord Shafte&s;|bury, was the mo&s;t extraordinary man of his age; he had been a member of the long par|liament, and had great influence among the pre&s;byterians; he was a favourite of Crom|well, and afterwards had a con&s;iderable hand in the re&s;toration; he was turbulent, ambi|tious, &s;ubtle, and enterpri&s;ing; well acquaint|ed with the blind attachment of parties, he &s;urmounted all &s;hame; and while he had the character of never betraying any of his friends, yet he changed his party as it &s;uited his con|venience. The duke of Buckingham was gay, capricious, of &s;ome wit, and great viva|city, well fitted to unite, and harmonize the graver tempers of which this junto was com|po&s;ed. Arlington was a man but of very mo|derate capacity, his intentions were good, but he wanted courage to per&s;evere in them. La&s;t|ly, the duke of Lauderdale, who was not de|fective in natural, and &s;till le&s;s in acquired ta|lents, but neither was his addre&s;s graceful, nor his under&s;tanding ju&s;t; he was ambitious, ob&s;tinate, in&s;olent, and &s;ullen. The&s;e were the men to whom Charles gave up the con|duct
<PB N="397" REF="399">
of his affairs; and who plunged the re|maining part of his reign in difficulties,<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="A.D."> which produced the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>A &s;ecret alliance with France, and a rup|ture with Holland, were the fir&s;t con&s;equences of their advice. The duke of York had the confidence boldly to declare him&s;elf a catho|lic; and to alarm the fears of the nation &s;till more, a liberty of con&s;cience was allowed to all &s;ectaries, whether di&s;&s;enters, or papi&s;ts. The&s;e mea&s;ures were con&s;idered by the peo|ple as de&s;tructive, not only of their liber|ties, but of their religion, which they va|lued more. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, con|taining very rigorous clau&s;es in favour of pre&s;&s;|ing; another full of menaces again&s;t tho&s;e who ventured to &s;peak undutifully of his ma|je&s;ty's mea&s;ures; and even again&s;t tho&s;e who heard &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, unle&s;s they informed in due time again&s;t the offenders. The&s;e mea|&s;ures, though &s;till within bounds, were yet no way &s;uitable to that legal admini&s;tration, which upon his re&s;toration he had promi&s;ed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h now &s;aw them&s;elves engaged in a league with France again&s;t the Dutch; and con&s;equently, whether victorious or vanqui&s;h|ed, their efforts were like to be equally un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.
<PB N="398" REF="400">
The French had for &s;ome years been growing into power; and now, under the con|duct of their ambitious monarch, Lewis XIV. they began to threaten the liberties of Europe, and particularly the prote&s;tant religion, of which Lewis had &s;hewn him&s;elf a determined enemy. It gave the people, therefore, a gloomy pro&s;pect, to &s;ee an union formed, which, if &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t totally &s;ubvert that balance of power, which the prote&s;tants aimed at pre|&s;erving; nor were they le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of their own &s;overeign, who, though he pretend|ed to turn all religion to ridicule in his gayer hours, yet was &s;ecretly attached to the catho|lics, or was very much &s;u&s;pected of being &s;o. The fir&s;t events of this war, therefore, were very corre&s;pondent to their fears of French treachery. The Engli&s;h and French combin|ed fleets, commanded by the duke of York, and the mare&s;chal d'Etrees, met the Dutch fleet to the number of ninety &s;ail, commanded by admiral de Ruyter, and a furious battle en|&s;ued. In this engagement, the gallant Sand|wich, who commanded the Engli&s;h van, drove his &s;hip into the mid&s;t of the enemy, beat off the admiral that ventured to attack him, &s;unk another &s;hip that attempted to board him, and &s;unk three fire-&s;hips that endeavoured
<PB N="399" REF="401">
to grapple with him. Tho' his ve&s;&s;el was torn with &s;hot, and out of a thou&s;and men, there only remained four hundred, he &s;till continued to thunder in the mid&s;t of the engagement. At la&s;t a fire-&s;hip, more fortunate than the former, having laid hold of his ve&s;&s;el, her de&s;truction was now inevitable. Sandwich however refu&s;ed to quit his &s;hip, though warned by Sir Edward Haddock his captain; he peri&s;hed in the flames, while the engagement continued to rage all around him. Night parted the combatants; the Dutch retired, and were not followed by the Engli&s;h. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the two maritime powers was nearly equal; but the French &s;uffered very little, not having entered into the heat of the engagement. It was even &s;uppo&s;ed that they had orders for this conduct, and to &s;pare their own &s;hips, while the Dutch and Engli&s;h &s;hould grow weak by their mu|tual animo&s;ities.</P>
<P>The combined powers were much more &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Dutch by land. Lewis conquered all before him, cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, took all the frontier towns of the enemy, and threatened the new republic with a final di&s;&s;o|lution. Terms were propo&s;ed to them by the two conquerors. Lewis offered them &s;uch as would have deprived them of all power of

re&s;i&s;ting an inva&s;ion from France by land. Tho&s;e of Charles expo&s;ed them equally to every inva&s;ion from &s;ea. At la&s;t, the murmurs of the Engli&s;h at &s;eeing this brave and indu&s;trious people, the &s;upporters of the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, totally &s;unk, and on the brink of de&s;truction, were too loud not to impre&s;s the king. He was obliged to call a parliament to take the &s;en&s;e of the nation upon his conduct; <MILESTONE N="1673" UNIT="A.D."> and he &s;oon &s;aw how his &s;ubjects &s;tood affected.</P>
<P>The eyes of all men, both abroad and at home, were fixed upon this new parliament, which, af|ter many prorogations, continued &s;itting for near two years. Before the commons entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s, there lay before them an affair, which di&s;covered, beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, the arbitrary projects of the king. It had been a con&s;tant practice in the hou&s;e for many years, in ca&s;e of any vacancy, to i&s;&s;ue out writs for new elections; but, by Shafte&s;bury's advice, &s;everal members had taken their &s;eats upon more irregular writs i&s;&s;ued by the chancellor; &s;o that the whole hou&s;e in time might be filled with members clande&s;tinely called up by the court. The hou&s;e was no &s;ooner therefore a&s;&s;embled, and the &s;peaker placed in his chair, than a motion was made again&s;t this method of election; and the members them&s;elves,
<PB N="401" REF="403">
thus called to parliament, had the mode&s;ty to withdraw.</P>
<P>The king's late declaration of indulgence to all &s;ectaries was next taken into con&s;ideration, and a remon&s;trance drawn up again&s;t that ex|erci&s;e of the prerogative. The commons per|&s;i&s;ted in their oppo&s;ition to it; and repre&s;ented that &s;uch a practice, if admitted, might tend to interrupt the free cour&s;e of the laws, and alter the legi&s;lative power, which had always been acknowledged to re&s;ide in the king and the two hou&s;es. Charles, therefore, found him&s;elf obliged, reluctantly, to retract his declaration; but that he might do it with a better grace, he a&s;ked the opinion of the hou&s;e of peers, who advi&s;ed him to comply. The commons ex|pre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction with this mea|&s;ure, and the mo&s;t entire duty to the king. He on his part a&s;&s;ured them, that he would wil|lingly pa&s;s any law which might tend to give them &s;atisfaction in all their ju&s;t grievances.</P>
<P>Having abridged the king's &s;tretches of power in the&s;e points, they went &s;till farther, and re&s;olved to make the conformity of na|tional principles &s;till more general. A law was pa&s;&s;ed, entitled the Te&s;t act, impo&s;ing an oath on all who &s;hould enjoy any public office. Be&s;ides the taking the oaths of allegiance, and
<PB N="402" REF="404">
the king's &s;upremacy, they were obliged to receive the &s;acrament once a year in the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church, and to abjure all belief in the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. As the di&s;&s;en|ters al&s;o had &s;econded the efforts of the com|mons again&s;t the king's declaration for indul|gence, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed for their ea&s;e and re|lief, which, however, went with &s;ome difficulty through the hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>But &s;till the great object of their meeting was to be enquired into; for the war again&s;t the Dutch continued to rage with great ani|mo&s;ity. Several &s;ea engagements &s;ucceeded each other very rapidly, which brought on no deci&s;ive action; both nations claiming the victory after every battle. The commons, therefore, weary of the war, and di&s;tru&s;tful even of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved that the &s;tanding army was a grievance. They next declared, that they would grant no more &s;upplies to carry on the Dutch war, unle&s;s it appeared that the ene|my continued &s;o ob&s;tinate as to refu&s;e all rea&s;on|able conditions. To cut &s;hort the&s;e di&s;agreeable altercations, the king re&s;olved to prorogue the parliament; and, with that intention, he went unexpectedly to the hou&s;e of peers, and &s;ent the u&s;her of the black-rod to &s;ummon the hou&s;e of commons to attend. It happened that
<PB N="403" REF="405">
the &s;peaker and the u&s;her nearly met at the door of the hou&s;e; but the &s;peaker, being within, &s;ome of the members &s;uddenly &s;hut the door, and cried To the chair! Upon which the following motions were in&s;tantly made in a tumultuous manner. That the alliance with France was a grievance; that the evil coun&s;ellors of the king were a grievance; that the duke of Lauderdale was a grievance; and then the hou&s;e ro&s;e in great confu&s;ion. The king &s;oon &s;aw that he could expect no &s;upply from the commons for carrying on the war, which was &s;o odious to them; he re&s;olved, therefore, to make a &s;eperate peace with the Dutch, on terms which they had propo&s;ed through the channel of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. For form &s;ake, he a&s;ked the advice of his parliament, who, concurring heartily in his intentions, a peace was concluded accordingly.</P>
<P>This turn in the &s;y&s;tem of the king's politics was very plea&s;ing to the nation in general; but the Cabal quickly &s;aw that it would be the de&s;truction of all their future attempts and power. Shafte&s;bury, therefore, was the fir&s;t to de&s;ert them, and go over to the country party, who received him, with open arms, and tru&s;ted him with unbounded re&s;erve. Clifford was dead. Buckingham was de&s;irous of imitating
<PB N="404" REF="406">
Shafte&s;bury's example. Lauderdale and Ar|lington were expo&s;ed to all the effects of na|tional re&s;entment. Articles of impeachment were drawn up again&s;t the former, which, however, were never pro&s;ecuted; and as for the other, he every day grew more and more out of favour with the king, and contemptible to the people. This was an end of the power of a junto, that had laid a &s;etled plan for over|turning the con&s;titution, and fixing unlimited monarchy upon its ruins.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="A.D."> In the mean time, the war between the Dutch and the French went on with the greate&s;t vigour; and although the latter were repre&s;&s;ed for a while, they &s;till continued making en|croachments upon the enemies territories. The Dutch forces were commanded by the prince of Orange, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage, acti|vity, vigilance, and patience; but he was in|ferior in genius to tho&s;e con&s;ummate generals oppo&s;ed to him. He was, therefore, always un&s;ucce&s;sful; but &s;till found means to repair his lo&s;&s;es, and to make head in a little time again&s;t his victorious enemies. The&s;e ineffec|tual &s;truggles for the pre&s;ervation of his coun|try's freedom, intere&s;ted the Engli&s;h &s;trongly in his favour; &s;o that from being his oppo&s;ers, they now wi&s;hed to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They
<PB N="405" REF="407">
con&s;idered their alliance with France as threa|tening a &s;ubver&s;ion to the prote&s;tant, religion; and they longed for an union with him, as the only means of &s;ecurity. The commons, there|fore, adre&s;&s;ed the king, repre&s;enting the dan|ger to which the kingdom was expo&s;ed from the growing greatne&s;s of France; and they a&s;&s;ured him, in ca&s;e of a war, that they would not be backward in their &s;upplies. Charles was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the latter part of their addre&s;s, as money was nece&s;&s;ary for his plea&s;ures. He therefore told them, that unle&s;s they granted him &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to give them a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. The commons refu&s;ed to tru&s;t to his maje&s;ty's profe&s;&s;ions; his well known profu&s;ion was before their eyes. The king reproved them for their diffi|dence, and immediately ordered them to ad|journ.<MILESTONE N="1677" UNIT="A.D."> The marriage of the duke of York's elde&s;t daugther, the prince&s;s Mary, heir appa|rent to the crown, with the prince of Orange, was a mea&s;ure that gave great &s;atisfaction in the&s;e general di&s;quietudes about religion. The negotiation was brought about by the king's own de&s;ire; and the prote&s;tants now &s;aw an happy pro&s;pect before them of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that would be favourable to their much loved

reformation. A negotiation for peace between the French and the Dutch followed &s;oon after, which was rather favourable to the latter. But the mutual animo&s;ities of the&s;e &s;tates not being as yet &s;ufficiently quelled, the war was conti|nued for &s;ome time longer. The king, therefore, to &s;atisfy his parliament, who declar|ed loudly again&s;t the French, &s;ent over an army of three thou&s;and men to the continent, under the command of the duke of Mon|mouth, to &s;ecure O&s;tend. A fleet al&s;o was fitted out with great diligence; and a quadru|ple alliance was projected between England, Holland, Spain, and the Emperor. The&s;e vigorous mea&s;ures brought about the famous treaty of Nimeguen, which gave a general peace to Europe.<MILESTONE N="1678" UNIT="A.D."> But though peace was &s;e|cured abroad, the di&s;contents of the people &s;till continued at home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. CHARLES II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS reign pre&s;ents the mo&s;t amazing contra&s;ts of levity and cruelty, of mirth and gloomy &s;u&s;picion. Ever &s;ince the fatal league with France, the people had entertained vio|lent jealou&s;ies again&s;t the court. The fears and di&s;contents of the nation were vented without re&s;traint; the apprehen&s;ions of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, an abandoned court, and a parliament which, though &s;ometimes a&s;&s;er|tors of liberty, yet continuing for &s;eventeen years without change; the&s;e naturally render|ed the minds of mankind timid and &s;u&s;picious, and they only wanted objects on which to wreck their ill humour.</P>
<P>When the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h is once rou&s;|ed, they either find objects of &s;u&s;picion or make them. On the twelfth of Augu&s;t, one Kirby, a chemi&s;t, acco&s;ted the king as he was walking in the Park.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, &s;aid he, keep within the company, your enemies have a de&s;ign upon your life, and you may be
<PB N="408" REF="410">
&s;hot in this very walk."</Q>
Being que&s;tioned in con&s;equence of this &s;trange intimation, he offered to produce one doctor Tongue, a weak credulous clergyman, who had told him that two per&s;ons, named Grove and Pickering, were engaged to murder the king; and that Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician, had undertaken the &s;ame ta&s;k by poi&s;on. Tongue was introduced to the king with a bundle of papers relating to this pretended con|&s;piracy, and was referred to the lord trea&s;urer Danby. He there declared that the papers were thru&s;t under his door; and he afterwards declared, that he knew the author of them, who de&s;ired that his name might be concealed, as he dreaded the re&s;entment of the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>This information appeared &s;o vague and un&s;atisfactory, that the king concluded the whole was a fiction. However Tongue was not to be repre&s;&s;ed in the ardour of his loyalty; he went again to the lord trea&s;urer, and told him, that a pacquet of letters, written by Je&s;uits concerned in the plot, was that night to be put into the po&s;t-hou&s;e for Wind&s;or, directed to one Bedingfield, a Je&s;uit, who was confe&s;&s;or to the duke of York, and who re&s;ided there. The&s;e letters had actually been received a few hours before by the duke; but he had &s;hewn them to the king as
<PB N="409" REF="411">
a forgery, of which he neither knew the drift nor the meaning. This incident &s;till farther con|firmed the king in his incredulity. He de&s;ired, however, that it might be concealed, as it might rai&s;e a flame in the nation; but the duke, &s;ollicitous to prove his innocence, in|&s;i&s;ted upon a nicer di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which turned out very different from his expectations.</P>
<P>Titus Oates, who was the fountain of all this dreadful intelligence, was produced &s;oon after, who, with &s;eeming reluctance, came to give his intelligence. This man affirmed that he had fallen under the &s;u&s;picion of the Je&s;uits, and that he had concealed him&s;elf, in order to avoid their re&s;entment. This Titus Oates was an abandoned mi&s;creant, ob&s;cure, illiterate, vulgar, and indigent. He had been once in|dicted for perjury, was afterwards chaplain on board a man of war, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for unna|tural practices. He then profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Roman catholic, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to St. Omer's, where he was for &s;ome time main|tained in the Engli&s;h &s;eminary of that city. The fathers of that college &s;ent him with &s;ome di&s;patches to Spain; but after his return, when they became better acquainted with his character, they would not &s;uffer him to conti|nue among them; &s;o that he was obliged to
<PB N="410" REF="412">
return to London, where he was ready to en|counter every danger for his &s;upport. At a time that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been en|tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret involving the fate of kings, he was allowed to remain in &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that Kirby was obliged to &s;upply him with daily bread.</P>
<P>He had two methods to proceed, either to ingratiate him&s;elf by this information with the mini&s;try, or to alarm the people, and thus turn their fears to his advantage. He cho&s;e the latter method. He went, therefore, with his two companions to Sir Edmond&s;bury Godfrey, a noted and active ju&s;tice of peace, and before him depo&s;ed to a narrative dre&s;&s;|ed up in terrors fit to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the vulgar. The pope, he &s;aid, con&s;idered him&s;elf as entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Eng|land and Ireland, on account of the here&s;y of the prince and people, and had accordingly a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty of the&s;e kingdoms. This, which was &s;aint Peter's patrimony, he had delivered up to the Je&s;uits, and Oliva, the general of that order, was his delegate. Se|veral Engli&s;h catholic lords, who&s;e names he mentioned, were appointed by the pope to the other offices of &s;tate; lord Arundel was cre|ated chancellor, lord Powis trea&s;urer, Sir Wil|liam
<PB N="411" REF="413">
Godolphin privy-&s;eal, Coleman, the duke's &s;ecretary, was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Lang|horne attorney-general, lord Bela&s;is general of the forces, lord Peters lieutenant-general, and lord Stafford pay-ma&s;ter. The king, whom the Je&s;uits called the Black Ba&s;tard, was &s;olemnly tried by them, and condemned as an heretic. He a&s;&s;erted that father Le Shee, meaning the French king's confe&s;&s;or La Chai&s;e, had offered ten thou&s;and pounds to any man who &s;hould kill the king. Ten thou&s;and pounds had been offered to Sir George Wakeman to poi&s;on him; but he was mercenary, and demanded fifteen thou&s;and, which demand was complied with. Le&s;t the&s;e means &s;hould fail, four Iri&s;h ruffians had been employed by the Je&s;uits at the rate of twenty guineas a piece to &s;tab the king at Wind&s;or. Colman, late &s;ecretary to the dutche&s;s of York, was deeply involved in the plot, and had given a guinea to the me&s;|&s;enger, who carried them orders for the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination. Grove and Pickering, to make &s;ure work, were employed to &s;hoot the king, and that too with &s;ilver bullets. The former was to receive fifteen hundred pounds for his pains, and the latter, being a pious man, thirty thou|&s;and ma&s;&s;es. Pickering would have executed his purpo&s;e, had not the flint dropped out of
<PB N="412" REF="414">
his pi&s;tol at one time, and at another the prim|ing. Oates went on to &s;ay that he him&s;elf was chiefly employed in carrying notes and letters among the Je&s;uits, all tending to the &s;ame end of murthering the king. A wager of an hun|dred pound was made, and the money depo&s;ited, that the king &s;hould eat no more Chri&s;tma&s;s pyes. The great fire of London had been the work of the Je&s;uits; &s;everal other fires were re&s;olv|ed on, and a paper model was already framed for firing the city anew. Fire-balls were called among them Tewk&s;bury mu&s;tard-pills. Twenty thou&s;and catholics in London were prepared to ri&s;e; and Coleman had remitted two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds to a&s;&s;i&s;t the rebels in Ireland. The duke of York was to be of|fered the crown in con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e probable &s;chemes, on condition of ex|tirpating the prote&s;tant religion. Upon his re|fu&s;al <Q REND="inline">"To pot James mu&s;t go,"</Q> as the Je|&s;uits were &s;aid to expre&s;s it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this dreadful informa|tion, &s;ufficiently marked with ab&s;urdity, vul|garity, and contradiction, Titus Oates became the favourite of the people, notwith&s;tanding during his examination before the council, be &s;o betrayed the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his impo&s;tures, that he contradicted him&s;elf in every &s;tep of his
<PB N="413" REF="415">
narration. While in Spain he had been car|ried, he &s;aid, to Don John, who promi&s;ed great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the execution of the catho|lic de&s;igns. The king a&s;ked him what &s;ort of a man his old acquaintance Don John was. Oates replied that he was a tall lean man, which was directly contrary to the truth, as the king well knew. Though he pretended great intimacies with Coleman, yet he knew him not when placed very near him, and had no other excu&s;e but that his &s;ight was bad by candle-light. He was guilty of the &s;ame mi&s;|take with regard to Sir George Wakeman.</P>
<P>But the&s;e improbabilities had no weight again&s;t the general wi&s;h, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, that they &s;hould be true. The violent ani|mo&s;ity which had been excited again&s;t the ca|tholics in general, made the people find a gloomy plea&s;ure in hoping for an opportunity of &s;atiating their hatred. The more impro|bable any account &s;eemed, the more unlikely it was that any impo&s;tor &s;hould invent improba|bilities, and therefore appeared more like truth.</P>
<P>A great number of the Je&s;uits mentioned by Oates were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. Coleman, who was &s;aid to have acted &s;o &s;tre|nuous a part in the con&s;piracy, at fir&s;t retired; but next day &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the &s;ecre|tary
<PB N="414" REF="416">
of &s;tate, and &s;ome of his papers, by Oates's directions, were &s;ecured. The&s;e papers, which were &s;uch as might be naturally expected from a zealous catholic in his &s;ituation, were converted into very dangerous evidence again&s;t him. He had, without any doubt, maintained a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the French king's confe&s;|&s;or, with the pope's nuncio at Bru&s;&s;els, and with many other catholics abroad, in which there was a di&s;tant project on foot for bring|ing back popery upon the acce&s;&s;ion of the duke of York. But the&s;e letters contained nothing that &s;erved as proof in the pre&s;ent in|formation; and their very &s;ilence in that re&s;pect, though they appeared imprudent enough in others, was a proof again&s;t Oates's pretended di&s;covery. However, when the contents of tho&s;e letters were publicly known, they diffu&s;ed the panic which the former narrative had be|gun. The two plots were brought to &s;trength|en each other, and confounded into one. Cole|man's letters &s;hewed there had actually been de&s;igns on foot, and Oates's narrative was &s;up|po&s;ed to give the particulars.</P>
<P>In this fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ions, an accident &s;erved to confirm the prejudices of the peo|ple, and to put it beyond a doubt that Oates's narrative was nothing but the truth. Sir Ed|mond&s;bury
<PB N="415" REF="417">
Godfrey, who had been &s;o active in unravelling the whole my&s;tery of the po|pi&s;h machinations, after having been mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome days, was found dead in a ditch by Primro&s;e-hill, in the way to Hamp&s;tead. His own &s;word was thru&s;t though his body; but no blood had flowed from the wound; &s;o that it appeared he was dead &s;ome time before this method was taken to deceive the public. He had money in his pockets, and there was a broad livid mark quite round his neck, which was di&s;located. The cau&s;e of his death re|mains, and mu&s;t &s;till continue, a &s;ecret; but the people, already enraged again&s;t the papi&s;ts, did not he&s;itate a moment to a&s;cribe it to them. No farther doubt remained of Oates's vera|city; the voice of the whole nation united again&s;t them; and the populace were exa&s;per|ated to &s;uch a degree, that moderate men be|gan to dread a general ma&s;&s;acre of that un|happy &s;ect. The body of Godfrey was car|ried through the &s;treets in proce&s;&s;ion, pre|ceded by &s;eventy clergymen; and every one who &s;aw it made no doubt that his death could be only cau&s;ed by the papi&s;ts. Even the bet|ter &s;ort of people were infected with this vul|gar prejudice; and &s;uch was the general con|viction of popi&s;h guilt, that no per&s;on, with
<PB N="416" REF="418">
any regard to per&s;onal &s;afety, could expre&s;s the lea&s;t doubt concerning the information of Oates, or the murther of Godfrey.</P>
<P>It only remained for the parliament to re|pre&s;s the&s;e delu&s;ions, and to bring back the people to calm and deliberate enquiry. But the parliament te&s;tified greater credulity than even the vulgar. The cry of plot was im|mediately echoed from one hou&s;e to the other; the country party would not let &s;lip &s;uch an opportunity of managing the pa&s;&s;ions of the people; the courtiers were afraid of being thought di&s;loyal, if they &s;hould doubt the in|nocence of the pretended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of their king. Danby, the prime mini&s;ter, him&s;elf en|tered into it very furiou&s;ly; and though the king told him that he had thus given the hou&s;es a handle to ruin him&s;elf, and to di&s;turb the affairs of government, yet this mini&s;ter per&s;evered, till he found the king's progno&s;tic but too true.</P>
<P>The king him&s;elf, who&s;e &s;afety was thus threatened and defended, was the only per&s;on who treated the plot with becoming contempt. He made &s;everal efforts for &s;tifling an enquiry, which was likely to involve the kingdom in confu&s;ion, and mu&s;t at any rate hurt his bro|ther, who had more than once profe&s;&s;ed his re|&s;olution to defend the catholic religion.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="419">In order to continue and propagate the alarm, an addre&s;s was voted for a &s;olemn fa&s;t. It was reque&s;ted that all papers tending to throw light upon &s;o horrible a con&s;piracy might be laid before the hou&s;e, that all papi&s;ts &s;hould remove from London, that acce&s;s &s;hould be denied at court to all unknown and &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons, and that the train-bands in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;hould be in readine&s;s to march. They voted, after hearing Oates's evidence, that there was a damnable and hel|li&s;h plot, contrived and carried on by the po|pi&s;h recu&s;ants, for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating and murdering the king, and for rooting out the prote&s;tant religion. Oates, who had acknowleged the ac|cu&s;ations again&s;t his morals to be true, was, how|ever, recommended by parliament to the king. He was lodged in Whitehall, and encouraged by a pen&s;ion of twelve hundred pounds a-year to proceed in forging new informations.</P>
<P>The encouragement given to Oates did not fail to bring in others al&s;o, who hoped to profit by the delu&s;ion of the times William Bedloe, a man, if po&s;&s;ible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next upon the &s;tage. He was, like the former, of very low birth, had been noted for &s;everal cheats and thefts, had travelled over many parts of Europe under
<PB N="418" REF="420">
borrowed names, and had frequently pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for a man of quality. This man, at his own de&s;ire, was arre&s;ted at Bri&s;tol, and conveyed to London, where he declared be|fore the council that he had &s;een the body of Sir Edmond&s;bury Godfrey at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, where the queen lived. He &s;aid that a &s;ervant of lord Bella&s;is offered to give him four thou|&s;and pounds if he would carry it off. He was que&s;tioned about the plot, but utterly de|nied all knowlege of it, and al&s;o a&s;&s;erted that he had no acquaintance with Oates. Next day, however, he thought it would be better to &s;hare the emoluments of the plot, and he gave an ample account of it. This narrative he made to tally as well as he could with the in|formation of Oates, which had been publi&s;hed; but to render it the more acceptable, he added &s;ome circum&s;tances of his own, &s;till more tre|mendous, and &s;till more ab&s;urd, than tho&s;e of Oates. He &s;aid that ten thou&s;and men were to be landed from Flanders in Burlington-bay, and were immediately to &s;eize Hull. He affirmed that the lords Powis and Petre had undertaken to rai&s;e an army in Radnor&s;hire; that fifty thou&s;and men were ready to ri&s;e in London; that he him&s;elf had been tampered with to murder a <HI>man,</HI> and was to receive four thou&s;and pounds

for that &s;ervice, be&s;ide the pope's ble&s;&s;ing; that the king was to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, the pro|te&s;tants butchered, and the kingdom offered to One, if he would con&s;ent to hold it of the church; if not, the pope &s;hould continue to govern without him. He likewi&s;e accu&s;ed the lords Carrington and Brudenell, who were committed to cu&s;tody by order of parliament. But the mo&s;t terrible part of all was that Spain was to invade England with forty thou|&s;and men, who were ready at St. Jago in the character of pilgrims; though at this time Spain was actually unable to rai&s;e ten thou&s;and men to &s;upply her own garri&s;ons in Flanders.</P>
<P>The&s;e narrations carry their own refutation; the infamy of the witne&s;&s;es, the contradiction in their te&s;timony, the improbability of it, the low vulgarity of the information, unlike what men tru&s;ted with great affairs would be apt to form, all the&s;e &s;erve to rai&s;e our horror again&s;t the&s;e ba&s;e villians, and our pity at the delu&s;ion of the times that could credit &s;uch reports. In order to give a confident air to the di&s;covery, Bedloe publi&s;hed a pamphlet, with this title. <Q REND="inline">"A Narrative and impartial Di&s;covery of the horrid Popi&s;h Plot, carried on for the burning and de&s;troying the Cities of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter, with their &s;uburbs, &amp;c. by Captain

William Bedloe, lately engaged in that horrid de&s;ign, and one of the Popi&s;h committees for carrying on &s;uch fires."</Q> The papi&s;ts were thus become &s;o obnoxious, that vote after vote pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them in the hou&s;e of commons. They were called idolaters; and &s;uch as did not concur in acknowleging the truth of the epi|thet, were expelled the hou&s;e without ceremo|ny. Even the duke of York was permitted to keep his place in the hou&s;e by a majority of only two.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would not, &s;aid one of the lords, have &s;o much as a popi&s;h man or a popi&s;h woman to remain here, not &s;o much as a popi&s;h dog, or a popi&s;h bitch, not &s;o much as a popi&s;h cat to mew, or pur about our king."</Q>
This was wretched eloquence; but it was admirably &s;uited to the times.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the general voice in their favour, the witne&s;&s;es, who all along had en|larged their narratives, in proportion as they were greedily received, went a &s;tep farther, and ventured to accu&s;e the queen. The com|mons, in an addre&s;s to the king, gave counten|ance to this &s;candalous accu&s;ation; the lords rejected it with becoming di&s;dain. The king received the news of it with his u&s;ual good humour.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They think, &s;aid he, that I have a mind to a new wife; but for all that I will

He immediately ordered Oates to be &s;trictly confined, &s;eized his papers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants. But his favour with parliament &s;oon procured his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>Edward Coleman, &s;ecretary to the duke of York, was the fir&s;t who was brought to trial, as being mo&s;t obnoxious to tho&s;e who pretended to fear the introduction of popery. His letters were produced again&s;t him. They plainly te&s;tified a violent zeal for the catholic cau&s;e, and that alone at pre&s;ent was &s;ufficient to con|vict him. But Oates and Bedloe came in to make his condemnation &s;ure. The former &s;wore that he had &s;ent four&s;core guineas to a ruffian, who undertook to kill the king. The date of the tran&s;action he fixed in the month of Augu&s;t, but would not fix the particular day. Coleman could have proved that he was in the country the greate&s;t part of that month, and therefore the witne&s;s would not be parti|cular. Bedloe &s;wore that he had received a commi&s;&s;ion, &s;igned by the &s;uperior of the Je&s;uits, appointing him papal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and that he had con&s;ented to the king's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. After this unfortunate man's &s;entence, thus procured by the&s;e vipers, many members of both hou&s;es offered to interpo&s;e in his behalf, if he would make an ample con|fe&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="422" REF="424">
but as he was, in reality, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no trea&s;onable &s;ecrets, he would not procure life by fal&s;ehood and impo&s;ture. He &s;uffered with calmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, and to the la&s;t per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;tronge&s;t prote&s;tations of his innocence.</P>
<P>The trial of Coleman was &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e of Ireland, Pickering, and Grove. Ireland, a Je&s;uit, was accu&s;ed by Oates and Bedloe, the only witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, that he was one of the fifty Je&s;uits who had &s;igned the great re|&s;olve again&s;t the king. Ireland affirmed, and proved, that he was in Stafford&s;hire all the month of Augu&s;t, a time when Oates a&s;&s;erted he was in London. The jury brought him in guilty, and the judge commended their verdict. It was in the &s;ame manner &s;worn that Picker|ing and Grove had bound them&s;elves by an oath to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king; that they had pro|vided them&s;elves with &s;crewed pi&s;tols and &s;il|ver bullets. They both prote&s;ted their inno|cence, and were found guilty. All the&s;e un|happy men went to execution prote&s;ting their innocence, a circum&s;tance which made no im|pre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pectators; their being Je&s;uits bani&s;hed even pity from their &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>The animo&s;ities of the people, however, &s;eemed a little appea&s;ed by the execution of
<PB N="423" REF="425">
the&s;e four; but a new train of evidence was now di&s;covered, that kindled the flame once more. One Miles Prance, a gold&s;mith, and a profe&s;&s;ed Roman catholic, had been accu&s;ed by Bedloe of being an accomplice in Sir Edmond&s;bury's murder; and, upon his denial, had been load|ed with heavy irons, and thrown into the condemned hole, a place cold, dark, and noi|&s;ome. There the poor wretch lay groaning and exclaiming that he was not guilty; but being next day carried before Lord Shafte&s;bu|ry, and there threatened with &s;everer puni&s;h|ment in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, he demanded if a confe&s;&s;ion would procure his pardon. Being a&s;&s;ured of that, he had no longer courage to re&s;i&s;t, but confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an accomplice in Godfrey's murder. He &s;oon after, however, retracted his evidence before the king; but the &s;ame rigours being employed again&s;t him, he was induced once more to confirm his fir&s;t infor|mation. The murder he &s;aid was committed in Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, by the contrivance of Gerrard and Kelly, two Iri&s;h prie&s;ts. That Lawrence Hill, footman to the queen's trea&s;urer, Robert Green, cu&s;hion-keeper to her chapel, and Henry Berry, porter of the palace, followed Sir Edmond&s;bury at a di&s;tance, from ten in the morning till &s;even in the evening; but that
<PB N="424" REF="426">
pa&s;&s;ing by Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, Green throwing a twi&s;ted handkerchief over his head, he was &s;oon &s;trangled, and the body carried to a high chamber in Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, from whence it was removed to another apartment, where it was &s;een by Bedloe.</P>
<P>Hill, Green, and Berry, were tried upon this evidence, though Bedloe's narrative, and Prance's information, were totally irreconcile|able, and though their te&s;timony was invalidat|ed by contrary evidence, all was in vain, the pri&s;oners were condemned and executed. They all denied their guilt at execution; and as Berry died a prote&s;tant this circum&s;tance was regarded as very con&s;iderable. But in&s;tead of &s;topping the torrent of credulity, it only encrea&s;|ed the people's animo&s;ity again&s;t a prote&s;tant, who could at once be guilty of a popi&s;h plot, of murder, and of denying it in his la&s;t mo|ments.</P>
<P>This frightful per&s;ecution continued for &s;ome time; and the king, contrary to his own judgment, was obliged to give way to the popular fury. Whitebread, provincial of the Je&s;uits, Fenwick, Gavan, Turner, and Har|court, all of them of the &s;ame order, were brought to their trial: Langhorne &s;oon after. Be&s;ides Oates and Bedloe, Dugdale, a new wit|ne&s;s,
<PB N="425" REF="427">
appeared again&s;t the pri&s;oners. This man &s;pread the alarm &s;till farther, and even a&s;&s;erted, that two hundred thou&s;and papi&s;ts in England were ready to take arms. The pri|&s;oners proved, by &s;ixteen witne&s;&s;es from St. Omers, that Oates was in that &s;eminary at the time he &s;wore he was in London. But as they were papi&s;ts, their te&s;timony could gain no manner of credit. All pleas availed them nothing; both the Je&s;uits and Lang|horne were condemned and executed, with their la&s;t breath denying the crimes for which they died.</P>
<P>The informers had le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s on the trial of Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;i|cian, who, though they &s;wore with their u&s;ual animo&s;ity, was acquitted. His condemnation would have involved the queen in his guilt; and it is propable the judge and jury were afraid of venturing &s;o far.</P>
<P>The earl of Stafford, near two years after, was the la&s;t man that fell a &s;acrifice to the&s;e bloody wretches; the witne&s;&s;es produced a|gain&s;t him were Oates, Dugdale, and Tuber|ville. Oates &s;wore that he &s;aw Fenwick, the Je&s;uit, deliver Stafford a commi&s;&s;ion from the general of the Je&s;uits, con&s;tituting him pay-ma&s;ter of the papal army. Dugdale gave
<PB N="426" REF="428">
te&s;timony that the pri&s;oner had endeavoured to engage him in the de&s;ign of murdering the king. Turberville affirmed, that the pri&s;oner, in his own hou&s;e at Paris, had made him the &s;ame propo&s;al. The clamour and out-rage of the populace again&s;t the pri&s;oner was very great; he was found guilty and condemned to be hanged and quartered; but the king changed the &s;entence into that of beheading. He was executed on Tower-hill, where even his per&s;ecutors could not forbear &s;hedding tears at that &s;erene fortitude which &s;hone in every feature, motion, and accent of this aged nobleman. Some other lords, who were taken up and impri&s;oned upon the former evidence, were tried and acquitted &s;ome time after, when the people began to recover from their phrenzy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1679" UNIT="A.D."> But while the&s;e pro&s;ecutions were going for|ward, rai&s;ed by the credulity of the people, and &s;econded by the artifice of the parliament, other de&s;igns equally vindictive, were carried on. The lord trea&s;urer Danby was impeached in the hou&s;e of commons, by Seymour his ene|my. The principal charge again&s;t him was, his having written a letter to Montague, the king's amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, directing him to &s;ell the king's good offices at the treaty of Nimeguen,
<PB N="427" REF="429">
to the king of France for a certain &s;um of money; contrary to the general intere&s;ts of the confederates, and even tho&s;e of his own kingdoms. This was a charge he could not deny; and though the king was more culpa|ble than the mini&s;ter, yet the pro&s;ecution was carried on again&s;t him with vigour. But he had the happine&s;s to find the king re&s;olved to defend him. Charles a&s;&s;ured the parliament, that as he had acted in every thing by his or|ders, he held him as entirely blamele&s;s; and though he would deprive him of all his employ|ments, yet he would po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t on his per|&s;onal &s;afety. The lords were obliged to &s;ub|mit; however they went on to impeach him, and Danby was &s;ent to the Tower, but no wor&s;e con&s;equences en&s;ued.</P>
<P>The&s;e furious proceedings had been all car|ried on by an hou&s;e of commons that had now continued undi&s;&s;olved for above &s;eventeen years; the king, therefore, was re&s;olved to try a new one, which he knew could not be more unmanageable than the former. However, the new parliament did not in the lea&s;t abate of the activity and ob|&s;tinacy of their predece&s;&s;ors. The king, indeed, changed his council, by the advice of Sir William Temple, and admitted into it &s;everal of both parties, by which he hoped to appea&s;e his op|ponents;
<PB N="428" REF="430">
but the antipathy to popery had taken too fa&s;t a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of men's minds, to be removed by &s;o feeble a remedy. This hou&s;e re&s;olved to &s;trike at the root of the evil, which threatened them from a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and, after &s;ome deliberations a bill was brought in for the total exclu&s;ion of the duke of York from the crown of England and Ireland. It was by that intended, that the &s;overeignty of the&s;e kingdoms, upon the king's death or re|&s;ignation, &s;hould devolve to the per&s;on next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duke; and that all acts of royalty, which that prince &s;hould afterwards perform, &s;hould not only be void, but deemed trea&s;on. This important bill pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e, by a majority of &s;eventy nine.</P>
<P>Nor did their efforts re&s;t here, the com|mons voted the king's &s;tanding army and guards to be illegal. They proceeded to e&s;ta|bli&s;h limits to the king's power of impri&s;oning delinquents at will. It was now that the ce|lebrated &s;tatute, called the Habeas Corpus act, was pa&s;&s;ed, which confirms the &s;ubject in an ab|&s;olute &s;ecurity from oppre&s;&s;ive power. By this act, it was prohibited to &s;end any one to pri&s;ons beyond the &s;ea: no judge, under &s;evere penal|ties, was to refu&s;e to any pri&s;oner his writ of
<PB N="429" REF="431">
habeas corpus; by which the gaoler was to pro|duce in court the body of the pri&s;oner, whence the writ had its name, and to certify the cau&s;e of his detainer and impri&s;onments. If the goal lie within twenty miles of the judge, the writ mu&s;t be obeyed in three days, and &s;o propor|tionably for greater di&s;tances. Every pri&s;oner mu&s;t be indicted the fir&s;t term of his commit|ment, and brought to trial the &s;ub&s;equent term. And no man after being enlarged by court, can be recommitted for the &s;ame of|fence.</P>
<P>This law alone, would have been &s;ufficient to endear the parliament that made it to po&s;te|rity; and it would have been well if they had re&s;ted there. The duke of York had retired to Bru&s;&s;els during the&s;e troubles; but an in|di&s;po&s;ition of the king led him back to Eng|land, to be ready, in ca&s;e of any &s;ini&s;ter acci|dent, to a&s;&s;ert his right to the throne. After prevailing upon his brother to di&s;grace the duke of Monmouth, a natural &s;on of the king's, by one Mrs. Waters, and now become very popular, he him&s;elf retired to Scotland, under pretence of &s;till quieting the apprehen&s;ions of the Engli&s;h nation; but in reality, to &s;treng|then his intere&s;ts there. This &s;ece&s;&s;ion &s;erved
<PB N="430" REF="432">
&s;till more to enflame the country party, who were &s;trongly attached to the duke of Mon|mouth, and were re&s;olved to &s;upport him again&s;t the duke of York. Mobs, petitions, pope burnings, were artifices employed to keep up the terrors of popery, and alarm the court. The parliament had &s;hewn favour to the va|rious tribes of informers, and that &s;erved to encrea&s;e the number of the&s;e mi&s;creants; but plots them&s;elves al&s;o became more numerous. Plot was &s;et up again&s;t plot; and the people kept &s;till &s;u&s;pended in dreadful apprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Meal-Tub Plot, as it was called, was brought forward to the public on this occa&s;ion. One Dangerfield, more infamous, if po&s;&s;ible, than Oates and Bedloe, a wretch who had been &s;et in the pillory, &s;courged, branded, and tran&s;ported for felony and coining, hatched a plot in conjunction with a midwife, who&s;e name was Cellier, a Roman catholic, of aban|doned character. Dangerfield began by de|claring, that there was a de&s;ign on foot to &s;et up a new form of government, and remove the king and the royal family. He commu|nicated this intelligence to the king and the duke of York, who &s;upplied him with money,
<PB N="431" REF="433">
and countenanced his di&s;covery. He hid &s;ome &s;editious papers in the lodgings of one colo|nel Man&s;el; and then brought the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers to his apartment, to &s;earch for &s;muggled merchandize. The papers were found, and the council having examined the affair, concluded they were forged by Dan|gerfield. They ordered all the places he fre|quented to be &s;earched; and in the hou&s;e of Cellier, the whole &s;cheme of the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered upon paper, concealed in a meal-tub, from whence the plot had its name. Dangerfield being committed to Newgate, made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the forgery, which, though probably entirely of his own contrivance, he a&s;cribed to the earl of Ca&s;tle|main, the counte&s;s of Powis, and the five lords in the Tower. He &s;aid that the de&s;ign was to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es to prove a charge of &s;o|domy and perjury upon Oates, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the earl of Shafte&s;bury, to accu&s;e the dukes of Monmouth and Buckingham, the earls of E&s;&s;ex, Hallifax and others, of having been concerned in the con&s;piracy again&s;t the king and his brother. Upon this information, the earl of Ca&s;tlemain and the counte&s;s of Powis were &s;ent to the Tower, and the king him|&s;elf
<PB N="423" REF="434">
was &s;u&s;pected of encouraging this impo&s;|ture.</P>
<P>But it was not by plots alone the adver&s;e parties endeavoured to &s;upplant each other. Tumultuous petitions on the one hand, and flattering addre&s;&s;es on the other, were &s;ent up from all quarters. Wherever the country party prevailed, petitions filled with grie|vances and apprehen&s;ions, were &s;ent to the king with an air of humble in&s;olence. Where|ever the church, or the court party prevailed, addre&s;&s;es were framed, containing expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t regard to his maje&s;ty, and the deepe&s;t <HI>abhorrence</HI> of tho&s;e who endeavoured to di&s;turb the public tranquility. Thus the nation came to be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Petitioners</HI> and <HI>Abhorrers.</HI> Whig and Tory al&s;o were fir&s;t u&s;ed as terms of mutual reproach at this time. The Whigs, were &s;o denominated from a cant name given to the &s;our Scotch conven|ticlers, (Whig being milk turned &s;our.) The Tories were denominated from the Iri&s;h ban|ditti &s;o called, who&s;e u&s;ual manner of bidding people deliver, was by the Iri&s;h word Toree, or give me.</P>
<P>As this parliament &s;eemed even to &s;urpa&s;s the former in jealou&s;y and re&s;entment, the king was induced to di&s;&s;olve it; and could willing|ly
<PB N="433" REF="435">
have never applied to another. But his ne|ce&s;&s;ities, cau&s;ed by his want of oeconomy, and his numberle&s;s needy dependents, obliged him to call another. However every change &s;eemed only to inflame the evil; <MILESTONE N="1680" UNIT="A.D."> and his new parlia|ment &s;eemed willing to out do even their pre|dece&s;&s;ors. Every &s;tep they took, betrayed that zeal with which they were animated. They voted the legality of petitioning to the king; they fell with extreme violence on the Abhor|rers, who; in their addre&s;&s;es to the crown, had expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation of tho&s;e peti|tions. Great numbers of the&s;e were &s;eized by their order, from all parts of England, and committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody: the liberty of the &s;ubject, which had been &s;o carefully guarded by their own recent law, was every day violated by their arbitrary and capricious commitments. One Stowel of Exeter, was the per&s;on that put a &s;top to their proceedings; he refu&s;ed to obey the &s;erjeant at arms, who was &s;ent to apprehend him; he &s;tood upon his defence, and &s;aid he knew no law by which they pretended to commit him. The hou&s;e, finding it equally dangerous to proceed or to recede, got off by an eva&s;ion. They in|&s;erted in their votes, that Stowel was indi&s;po&s;|ed; and a month's time was allowed him for his recovery. It is happy for the nation, that
<PB N="434" REF="436">
&s;hould the commons at any time overleap the bounds of their authority, and order men ca|priciou&s;ly to be committed to pri&s;on; there is no power, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, that can compel the pri&s;oner to &s;ubmit to their decrees.</P>
<P>But the chief point which the commons la|boured to obtain, was the <HI>Exclu&s;ion Bill,</HI> which, though the former hou&s;e had voted, was never pa&s;&s;ed into a law. Shafte&s;bury, and many con|&s;iderable men of the party, had rendered them|&s;elves &s;o obnoxious to the duke of York, that they could find &s;afety in no mea&s;ure but his his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped that the ex|clu&s;ion of James would make room for their own patron. The duke of York's profe&s;&s;ed bigotry to the catholic &s;uper&s;tition influenced numbers; and his tyrannies, which were practi&s;ed without con|troul, while he continued in Scotland, rendered his name odious to thou&s;ands. In a week, there|fore, after the commencement of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, a motion was made for bringing in an exclu|&s;ion bill, and a committee was appointed for that purpo&s;e. The debates were carried on with great violence on both &s;ides; the bill was defended by lord Ru&s;&s;el, who had now re&s;ign|ed his office of attorney general, by Sir Wil|liam Jones, Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry Capel, Sir William Pultney, colonel Titus,
<PB N="435" REF="437">
Treby, Hambden, and Montague. It was op|po&s;ed by Sir Leoline Jenkins, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Sir John Ernely, chancellor of the ex|chequer; by Hyde, Seymour, and Temple: the bill pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority in the hou&s;e of commons, but was oppo&s;ed in the hou&s;e of peers with better &s;ucce&s;s. Shafte&s;bury, Sunderland, and E&s;&s;ex, argued for it. Halifax chiefly conducted the arguments again&s;t it. The king was pre&s;ent during the whole debate; and had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the bill thrown out by a very great majority. All the bi&s;hops, ex|cept three, voted again&s;t it; for they were of opinion that the church of England was in much greater danger from the prevalence of pre&s;byteriani&s;m, than of popery.</P>
<P>The commons were extremely mortified and enraged at the rejection of their favourite bill; and to &s;hew how &s;trongly they re&s;ented the indulgence which was &s;hewn to popery, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill for ea&s;ing the prote&s;tant di&s;|&s;enters, and for repealing &s;uch acts as tended to their per&s;ecution. They proceeded to bring in bills, which, though contributing to &s;ecure the liberty of the &s;ubject, yet probably at that period only calculated to excite them to in&s;urrection. They had thoughts of renewing the triennial act; of continuing the judges in their
<PB N="436" REF="438">
offices during good behaviour; of ordering an a&s;&s;ociation for the defence of his maje&s;ty's per|&s;on, and the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion. They voted, that till the exclu&s;ion bill was pa&s;&s;ed, they could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, grant the king any man|ner of &s;upply; and to prevent his taking other methods to get money, they voted that who|ever &s;hould hereafter lend, by way of advance, any money upon any branches of the king's revenue, &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible to parliament for his conduct. The king, therefore, finding that there were no hopes of extorting either money or obedience from the commons, came to a re&s;olution of once more di&s;&s;olving the parliament. His u&s;her of the black rod ac|cordingly came to di&s;&s;olve them, while they were voting that the di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be en|couraged, and that the papi&s;ts had burned the city of London.</P>
<P>The parliament thus di&s;&s;olved, it was con|&s;idered as a doubt, whether the king would ever call another: however, the de&s;ire he had of being &s;upplied with money, &s;urmounted his fears from every violence a parliament might offer. But it had always been &s;uppo&s;ed that the neighbourhood of London, at once both potent and factious, was an improper place

for a&s;&s;embling a parliament that would be &s;tedfa&s;t in the king's intere&s;ts; he therefore re|&s;olved at once to puni&s;h the Londoners, by &s;hewing his &s;u&s;picions of their loyalty; and to reward the inhabitants of Oxford, by bringing down his parliament to that city. Accord|ingly a parliament was ordered to a&s;&s;emble at Oxford,<MILESTONE N="1681" UNIT="A.D."> and mea&s;ures taken on both &s;ides to engage the partizans to be &s;trenuous in their re&s;olutions. In this, as in all former parlia|ments, the country party predominated: the parliamentary leaders came to that city, attend|ed not only by their &s;ervants but with numer|ous bands of their retainers. The four Lon|don members were followed by great multi|tudes, wearing ribbons, in which were woven the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"No Popery! No Slavery!"</Q> The king was not behind them in the num|ber and formidable appearance of his guards; &s;o that the parliament rather bore the appear|ance of a military congre&s;s, than of a civil a&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>This parliament trod exactly in the &s;teps of the former. The commons having cho&s;en the &s;ame &s;peaker, who filled the chair la&s;t par|liament, ordered the votes to be printed every day, that the public might be acquainted with the &s;ubject of their deliberations. The bill
<PB N="438" REF="440">
of exclu&s;ion was more fiercely urged than ever. Ernely, one of the king's mini&s;ters, propo&s;ed that the duke &s;hould be bani&s;hed during life, five hundred miles from England; and that upon the king's death, the next heir &s;hould be con&s;tituted regent with regal power. Yet even this expedient, which left the duke the bare title of king, could not obtain the atten|tion of the hou&s;e. Nothing but a total exclu|&s;ion could &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>Each party had now for &s;ome time reviled and ridiculed each other in pamphlets and libels; and this practice, at la&s;t, was attended with an incident, that de&s;erves notice. One Fitzharris, an Iri&s;h papi&s;t, dependent on the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, one of the king's mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, u&s;ed to &s;upply her with the&s;e occa|&s;ional publications. But he was re&s;olved to add to their number by his own endeavours; and employed one Everhard, a Scotchman, to write a libel again&s;t the king and the duke of York. The Scot was actually a &s;py for the oppo&s;ite party; and &s;uppo&s;ing this a trick to entrap him, he di&s;covered the whole to Sir William Waller, an eminent ju&s;tice of peace; and to convince him of the truth of his infor|mation, po&s;ted him, and two other per&s;ons, privately, where they heard the whole confer|ence
<PB N="439" REF="441">
between Fitzharris and him&s;elf. The libel compo&s;ed between them was replete with the utmo&s;t rancour and &s;currility. Waller carried the intelligence to the king, and ob|tained a warrant for committing Fitzharris, who happened at that very time to have a copy of the libel in his pocket. Seeing him&s;elf in the hands of a party, from which he ex|pected no mercy, he re&s;olved to &s;ide with them, and throw the odium of the libel upon the court, who, he &s;aid, were willing to draw up a libel, which, &s;hould be imputed to the ex|clu&s;ioners, and thus render them hateful to the people. He enchanced his &s;ervices with the country party, by a new popi&s;h plot, &s;till more tremendous than any of the forego|ing. He brought in the duke of York as a principal accomplice in this plot, and as a contriver in the murder of Sir Edmond&s;bury Godfrey.</P>
<P>The king impri&s;oned Fitzharris; the com|mons avowed his cau&s;e. They voted that he &s;hould be impeached by them&s;elves, to &s;creen him from the ordinary forms of ju&s;tice; the lords rejected the impeachment; the commons a&s;&s;erted their right; a commotion was likely to en&s;ue; and the king, to break off the con|te&s;t, went to the hou&s;e, and di&s;&s;olved the par|liament,
<PB N="440" REF="442">
with a fixed re&s;olution never to call another.</P>
<P>This vigorous mea&s;ure was a blow that the parliament had never expected; and nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of the times could have ju&s;ti|fied the king's manner of proceeding. From that moment, which ended the parliamentary commotions, Charles &s;eemed to rule with de&s;potic power; and he was re&s;olved to leave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his brother, but clogged with all the faults and misfortunes of his own ad|mini&s;tration. His temper, which had always been ea&s;y and merciful, now became arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained &s;pies and infor|mers round the throne, and impri&s;oned all &s;uch as he thought mo&s;t daring in their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to humble the pre&s;byterians; the&s;e were dive&s;ted of their employments and their places; and their offices given to &s;uch as held with the court, and approved the doc|trine of non-re&s;i&s;tance. The clergy began to te&s;tify their zeal and their principles by their writings and their &s;ermons; but though among the&s;e, the partizans of the king were the mo&s;t numerous, tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite faction were the mo&s;t enterprizing. The king openly e&s;|pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the former; and thus pla|cing him&s;elf at the head of a faction, he de|prived
<PB N="441" REF="443">
the city of London, which had long headed the popular party, of their charter. It was not till after an abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that he re&s;tored it to them, having previou&s;ly &s;ubjected the election of their magi&s;trates to his imme|diate authority.</P>
<P>Terrors al&s;o were not wanting to confirm this new &s;pecies of monarchy. Fitzharris was brought to his trial before a jury, and condem|ned, and executed. The whole gang of &s;pies, witne&s;&s;es, informers, &s;uborners, which had long been encouraged and &s;upported by the leading patriots, finding now that the king was entire|ly ma&s;ter, they turned &s;hort upon their ancient drivers, and offered their evidence again&s;t tho&s;e who had fir&s;t put them in motion. The king's mini&s;ters, with an horrid &s;atisfaction, gave them countenance and encouragement; &s;o that &s;oon the &s;ame cruelties, and the &s;ame inju&s;tice, was practi&s;ed again&s;t pre&s;byte|rian &s;chemes, that had been employed again&s;t catholic trea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on that fell under the di&s;plea|&s;ure of the mini&s;try, was one Stephen College, a London joiner, who had become &s;o noted for his jeal again&s;t popery, that he went by the name of the Prote&s;tant Joiner. He had attend|ed the city members to Oxford, armed with
<PB N="442" REF="444">
&s;word and pi&s;tol; he had &s;ometimes been heard to &s;peak irreverently of the king, and was now pre&s;ented by the grand jury of Lon|don as guilty of &s;edition. The &s;heriffs of London were in &s;trong oppo&s;ition to the court; and the grand jury, named by them, rejected the bill again&s;t College. However, the court were not to be foiled &s;o; they &s;ent the pri&s;oner to Oxford, where the trea&s;on was &s;aid to have been committed, and there tried before a partial judge, and a packed jury. He was accu&s;ed by Dugdale, Turberville, and others, who had already given evidence again&s;t the catholics; and the nation &s;aw them&s;elves reduced to a ridiculous dilemna upon their te&s;timony. The jury, who were royali&s;ts, could not accept their evidence, as they believ|ed them, to be abandoned liars, nor yet could they rejct it, as they were taught by their opponents to think them &s;ufficient evidence for conviction. College defended him&s;elf with great pre&s;ence of mind, and invalidated all their te&s;timonies. But all was in vain. The jury, after half an hour's deliberation, brought him in guilty, and the &s;pectators te&s;ti|fied their inhuman plea&s;ure, with a &s;hout of applau&s;e. He bore his fate with un&s;haken fortitude; and at the place of execution de|nied
<PB N="443" REF="445">
the crime for which he had been con|demned.</P>
<P>But higher vengeance was demanded by the king, who&s;e re&s;entment was chiefly level|led again&s;t the earl of Shafte&s;bury, and not without rea&s;on. No &s;ums were &s;pared to &s;eek for evidence, and even to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es a|gain&s;t this intriguing and formidable man. A bill of indictment being pre&s;ented to the grand jury, witne&s;&s;es were examined, who &s;wore to &s;uch incredible circum&s;tances, as mu&s;t have invalidated their te&s;timony, even if they had not been branded as perjured villains. Among his papers, indeed, a draught of an a&s;&s;ociation was found, which might have been con&s;trued into trea&s;on; but it was not in the earl's hand writing, nor could his adver&s;aries prove that he had ever communicated this &s;cheme to any body, or &s;ignified his approbation of any &s;uch project. The &s;heriffs had &s;ummon|ed a jury, who&s;e principles coincided with tho&s;e of the earl, and that probably, more than any want of proof, procured his &s;afety.</P>
<P>The power of the crown by this time be|came irre&s;i&s;tible,<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="A.D."> the city of London having been deprived of their charter, which was re&s;|tored only upon terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the giving up the nomination of their own ma|gi&s;trates
<PB N="444" REF="446">
was &s;o mortifying a circum&s;tance, that all the other corporations in England &s;oon began to fear the &s;ame treatment, and were, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively induced to &s;urrender their charters into the hands of the king. Con&s;ider|able &s;ums were exacted for re&s;toring the&s;e charters and all the offices of power and pro|fit were left at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown. Re|&s;i&s;tance now, however ju&s;tifiable, could not be &s;afe; and all prudent men &s;aw no other expe|dient, but peaceably &s;ubmiting to the pre&s;ent grievances. But there was a party in England that &s;till cheri&s;hed their former ideas of free|dom, and were re&s;olved to hazard every dan|ger in its defence.</P>
<P>This, like all other combinations, was made up of men, &s;ome guided by principle to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the pre&s;ent de&s;potic power, &s;ome by intere&s;t, and &s;till many more by re|venge. Some time before, in the year 1681, the king had been &s;eized with a fit of &s;ickne&s;s at Wind&s;or, which gave a great alarm to the pub|lic. Shafte&s;bury had even then attempted to ex|clude the duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and united with the duke of Monmouth, lord Ru&s;&s;el, and lord Grey, in ca&s;e of the king's death, they con&s;pired to ri&s;e in arms, and vindicate their opi|nions by the &s;word. Shafte&s;bury's impri&s;onment and trial for &s;ome time put a &s;top to the&s;e de&s;igns;
<PB N="445" REF="447">
but they &s;oon revived with his relea&s;e. Mon|mouth engaged the earl of Macclesfield, lord Brandon, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, and other gentle|men in Che&s;hire. Lord Ru&s;&s;el fixed a corre|&s;pondence with Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rowles, and Sir Francis Drake, who promi&s;ed to rai&s;e the We&s;t. Shafte&s;bury, with one Fergu&s;on, an independent clergyman, and a re&s;tle&s;s plotter, managed the city, upon which the confederates chiefly relied. It was now that this turbulent man found his &s;chemes mo&s;t likely to take effect. After the di&s;ap|pointment and de&s;truction of an hundred plots, he at la&s;t began to be &s;ure of this. But this &s;cheme, like all the former, was di&s;ap|pointed. The caution of lord Ru&s;&s;el, who in|duced the duke of Monmouth to put off the enterprize, &s;aved the kingdom from the hor|rors of a civil war; while Shafte&s;bury was &s;o &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of his impending danger that he left his hou&s;e, and lurking about the city attempted, but in vain, to drive the Londoners into open in&s;urrection. At la&s;t, enraged at the numberle&s;s cautions and delays which clogged and defeated his projects, he threatened to begin with his friends alone. However after a long &s;trug|gle between fear and rage, he abandoned all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and fled out of the kingdom to
<PB N="446" REF="448">
Am&s;terdam, where he ended his turbulent life &s;oon after, without being pitied by his friends, or feared by his enemies.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Shafte&s;bury, though it retarded the views of the con&s;pirators, did not &s;uppre&s;s them. A council of &s;ix was erected, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Monmouth, Ru&s;&s;el, E&s;&s;ex, Howard, Algernon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand|&s;on to the great man of that name. The&s;e corre&s;ponded with Argyle and the malcon|tents in Scotland, and re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the &s;cheme of the in&s;urrection, though they widely differed in principles from each other. Monmouth a&s;pired at the crown; Ru&s;&s;el and Hambden propo&s;ed to exclude the duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and redre&s;s the grievances of the nation; Sidney was for re|&s;toring the republic, and E&s;&s;ex joined in the &s;ame wi&s;h. Lord Howard was an abandoned man, who, having no principles, &s;ought to embroil the nation, to gratify his private in|tere&s;t in the confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such were the leaders of this con&s;piracy, and &s;uch their motives. But there was al&s;o a &s;et of &s;ubordinate con&s;pirators, who frequently met together, and carried on projects quite unknown to Monmouth and his council. Among the&s;e men was colonel Rum&s;ey, an
<PB N="447" REF="449">
old republican officer, together with lieutenant-colonel Walcot of the &s;ame &s;tamp, Goodenough, under-&s;heriff of London, a zealous and noted par|ty-man, Fergu&s;on, an independent mini&s;ter, and &s;everal attornies, merchants, and trade&s;men of London. But Rum&s;ey and Fergu&s;on were the only per&s;ons that had acce&s;s to the great lead|ers of the con&s;piracy. The&s;e men in their meetings embraced the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olu|tions. They propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king in his way to Newmarket; Rumbal, one of the party, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a farm upon that road called the Rye-hou&s;e, and from thence the con&s;piracy was denominated the Rye-hou&s;e Plot. They deliberated upon a &s;cheme of &s;topping the king's coach by overturning a cart on the high-way at this place, and &s;hoot|ing him through the hedges. The hou&s;e in which the king lived at Newmarket took fire accidentally, and he was obliged to leave New|market eight days &s;ooner than was expected, to which circum&s;tance his &s;afety was a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Among the con&s;pirators was one Keiling, who finding him&s;elf in danger of a pro&s;ecu|tion for arre&s;ting the lord-mayor of London, re&s;olved to earn his pardon by di&s;covering this plot to the mini&s;try. Colonel Rum&s;ey, and We&s;t, a lawyer, no &s;ooner under&s;tood
<PB N="448" REF="450">
that this man had informed again&s;t them, than they agreed to &s;ave their lives by turning king's evidence, and they &s;urrendered them&s;elves ac|cordingly. Sheppard, another con&s;pirator, being apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed all he knew, and general orders were &s;oon i&s;&s;ued out for apprehending the re&s;t of the leaders of the con&s;piracy. Monmouth ab&s;conded; Ru&s;&s;el was &s;ent to the Tower; Grey e&s;caped; Howard was taken concealed in a chimney; E&s;&s;ex, Sidney, and Hambden, were &s;oon after arre&s;ted, and had the mor|tification to find lord Howard an evidence again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Walcot was fir&s;t brought to trial and con|demned, together with Hone and Rou&s;e, two a&s;&s;ociates in the con&s;piracy, upon the evidence of Rum&s;ey, We&s;t, and Sheppard. They died penitent, acknowledging the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence by which they were executed. A much greater &s;acrifice was &s;hortly after to fol|low. This was the lord Ru&s;&s;el, &s;on of the earl of Bedford, a nobleman of numberle&s;s good qualities, and led into this con&s;piracy from a conviction of the duke of York's in|tentions to re&s;tore popery. He was liberal, popular, humane, and brave. All his virtues were &s;o many crimes in the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;picious di&s;|po&s;ition of the court. The chief evidence again&s;t
<PB N="449" REF="451">
him was lord Howard, a man of very bad character, one of the con&s;pirators, who was now contented to take life upon &s;uch terms, and to accept of infamous &s;afety. This wit|ne&s;s &s;wore that Ru&s;&s;el was engaged in the de|&s;ign of an in&s;urrection; but he acquitted him, as did al&s;o Rum&s;ey and We&s;t, of being privy to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. His own candour would not allow him to deny the de&s;ign in which he really was concerned; but his own confe&s;&s;ion was not &s;ufficient to convict him. To the fact which principally aimed at his life there was but one witne&s;s, and the law required two; this was over ruled; for ju&s;tice, during this whole reign, was too weak for the prevailing party. The jury, who were zealous royali&s;ts, after a &s;hort deliberation brought the pri&s;oner in guilty. After his condemnation the king was &s;trongly &s;ollicited in his favour. Even money, to the amount of two hundred thou|&s;and pounds, was offered to the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, by the old earl of Bedford, lord Ru&s;&s;el's father. The king was inexorable. He dreaded the principles and popularity of this nobleman, and re&s;ented his former activity in promoting the bill of exclu&s;ion. Lord Ca|vendi&s;h, the intimate friend of Ru&s;&s;el, offered to effect his e&s;cape by exchanging apparel
<PB N="450" REF="452">
with him, and remaining a pri&s;oner in his room. The duke of Monmouth &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to him, offering to &s;urrender him&s;elf, if he thought that &s;tep would contribute to his &s;afety. Lord Ru&s;&s;el generou&s;ly rejected both the&s;e expedients, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate with admirable fortitude. His con&s;ort, the daughter and heire&s;s of the earl of South|ampton, finding that all &s;upplications were vain, took leave of her hu&s;band without &s;hed|ding a tear; while, as he parted from her, he turned to tho&s;e about him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, &s;aid he, the bitterne&s;s of death is over."</Q>
A little before the &s;heriffs conducted him to the &s;caf|fold, he wound up his watch.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now, done with time, &s;aid he, and mu&s;t hence|forth think of eternity."</Q>
The &s;caffold for his execution was erected in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; he laid his head on the block without the lea&s;t change of countenance, and at two &s;trokes it was &s;evered from his body.</P>
<P>The celebrated Algernon Sidney, &s;on to the earl of Leice&s;ter, was next brought to his trial. He had been formerly engaged in the parliamentary army again&s;t the late king, and was even named on the high court of ju&s;tice that tried him, but had not taken his &s;eat among the judges. He had ever oppo&s;ed Cromwell's
<PB N="451" REF="453">
u&s;urpation, and went into voluntary bani&s;h|ment upon the re&s;toration. His affairs, however, requiring his return, he applied to the king for a pardon, and obtained his reque&s;t. But all his hopes and all his rea&s;onings were formed upon republican principles. For his adored republic he had written and fought, and went into bani&s;hment, and ventured to return. It may ea&s;ily be conceived how obnoxious a man of &s;uch principles was to a court that now was not even content with limitations to its power. They went &s;o far as to take illegal methods to procure his condemnation. The only witne&s;s that depo&s;ed again&s;t Sidney was lord Howard, and the law required two. In order, therefore, to make out a &s;econd witne&s;s, they had recour&s;e to a very extraordinary ex|pedient. In ran&s;acking his clo&s;et, &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;es on government were found in his own hand writing, containing principles favourable to liberty, and in them&s;elves no way &s;ubver|&s;ive of a limited government. By over&s;train|ing &s;ome of the&s;e they were con&s;trued in|to trea&s;on. It was in vain he alledged that papers were no evidence; that it could not be proved they were written by him; that, if proved, the papers them&s;elves contained nothing criminal. His defence was over|ruled;
<PB N="452" REF="454">
the violent and inhuman Jefferies, who was now chief-ju&s;tice, ea&s;ily prevailed on a partial jury to bring him in guilty, and his execution followed &s;oon after. One can &s;carce contemplate the tran&s;actions of this reign with|out horror. Such a picture of factious guilt on each &s;ide, a court at once immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;uality and blood, a people armed again&s;t each other with the mo&s;t deadly animo&s;ity, and no &s;ingle party to be found with &s;en&s;e enough to &s;tem the general torrent of rancour and factious &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Hambden was tried &s;oon after; and as there was nothing to affect his life, he was fined forty thou&s;and pounds. Holloway, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, who had fled to the We&s;t-Indies, was brought over, condemned, and executed. Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong al&s;o, who had fled to Hol|land, was brought over, and &s;hared the &s;ame fate. Lord E&s;&s;ex, who had been impri&s;oned in the Tower, was found in an apartment with his throat cut; but whether he was guilty of &s;uicide, or whether the bigotry of the times might not have induced &s;ome a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to com|mit the crime, cannot now be known.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t blood that was &s;hed for an imputation of plots or con&s;piracies, which con|tinued during the greate&s;t part of this reign.
<PB N="453" REF="455">
Neverthele&s;s the cruelty, and the gloomy &s;u&s;|picion of the duke of York, who, &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t parliament, daily came into power, was dreadful to the nation. Titus Oates was fined an hundred thou&s;and pounds, for calling him a popi&s;h traitor, and he was im|pri&s;oned till he could pay it, which he was ut|terly incapable of. A like illegal &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon Dutton Colt for the &s;ame offence. Sir Samuel Barnardi&s;ton was fined ten thou&s;and pounds, for having, in &s;ome private letters, re|flected on the government. Of all tho&s;e who were concerned in the late con&s;piracy, &s;carce one e&s;caped the &s;everity of the court, except the duke of Monmouth, and he was the mo&s;t culpable of any.</P>
<P>At this period, the government of Charles was as ab&s;olute as that of any monarch in Europe; but to plea&s;e his &s;ubjects by an act of populari|ty, he judged it proper to marry the lady Anne, his niece, to prince George, brother to the king of Denmark. This was the la&s;t tran&s;action of this extraordinary reign. The king was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit, which re&s;embled an apoplexy; and though he was recovered from it by bleeding, yet he langui&s;hed only for a few days, and then expired, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign. During his ill|ne&s;s,
<PB N="445" REF="456">
&s;ome clergymen of the church of Eng|land attended him, to whom he di&s;covered a total indifference. Catholic prie&s;ts were brought to his bed-&s;ide, and from their hands he receiv|ed the rites of their communion. Two papers were found in his clo&s;et, containing arguments in favour of that per&s;ua&s;ion. The&s;e were &s;oon after publi&s;hed by James his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, by which he greatly injured his own popularity, and his brother's memory.</P>
