<P>THOUGH the Study of Hi&s;|tory be in&s;tructive and u&s;e|ful; yet, in one Re&s;pect, it becomes the Source of frequent Error, even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth. This ari&s;eth from a <HI>mi&s;|taken Application</HI> of <HI>hi&s;torical Facts.</HI> This Error is apt to creep into all Rea&s;onings, on every Subject, where <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> are concerned; but it is peculiarly apt to infect <HI>political</HI> Rea&s;onings, above all others. As the political Intere&s;ts of Men make
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
the principal Subject of Hi&s;tory, &s;o the political Rea&s;oner hath Recour&s;e to Hi&s;tory, as the be&s;t Support of his Argument. But, though the Politi|cian is, of all others, the readie&s;t to appeal to Hi&s;tory, yet he &s;eems, of all others, mo&s;t liable to be mi&s;taken in his Application of it to his own Purpo&s;e; becau&s;e the political Con|nexions and Intere&s;ts of Men are, above all others, <HI>complicated</HI> and <HI>va|rious.</HI> Hence, as no two political Con&s;titutions were ever <HI>the &s;ame</HI> in <HI>all</HI> their Circum&s;tances, though <HI>&s;imi|lar</HI> in <HI>many</HI>; &s;o, all Arguments drawn from a <HI>partial Re&s;emblance</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>inadequate</HI> and <HI>inconclu&s;ive</HI>; unle&s;s when it appears, that no other Cir|cum&s;tances took Place, by which that <HI>partial Re&s;emblance</HI> might be <HI>counteracted,</HI> and it's Effects <HI>de&s;troy|ed.</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Yet it hath been a Practice too common among political Rea&s;oners, from a <HI>partial</HI> Re&s;emblance between two States, to infer a <HI>total</HI> one; and, becau&s;e they have been <HI>like</HI> in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Re&s;pects, to draw Conclu&s;ions, as if they had been <HI>like</HI> in <HI>all.</HI> Here, then, appears a Source of perpetual Error.</P>
<P>Among all the political Que&s;tions that can be debated in a free Coun|try, there is none of greater Import|ance, than that which regards the <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Influence</HI> of the <HI>Body of a People.</HI> Nothing hath been more u&s;ual among political Rea&s;oners, than to repre&s;ent the <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>every People,</HI> as the ready <HI>Tools</HI> of <HI>Demagogues</HI> and <HI>Faction:</HI> And &s;ince the endle&s;s Factions of the <HI>Athenian Republic</HI> have been &s;o often alledged, as unan&s;werable Proofs
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
of this; the intelligent Reader will ea|&s;ily di&s;cern, that the Tendency of the following Dialogue is, to fix this Ar|gument to it's <HI>proper Limits,</HI> and prevent a too <HI>general Application</HI> of a <HI>particular Fact.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD.</HEAD>
<STAGE>PERICLES and ARISTIDES:</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM glad to have found you, PERICLES: Since your Conver&s;ation with COSMO, (which, you know, I overheard) I have been revolving the Subject of it in my Mind; and begin to think, you left the Matter &s;hort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Sentiments on this Subject will give me Plea&s;ure. Tell me, ARISTIDES; in what Re&s;pect do you e&s;teem the con|clu&s;ion of our Argument to have been de|fective?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Regard to your&s;elf, I think your Conclu&s;ions were ju&s;t: I grant you, <Q>that by weakening the Power of the Court of the AREOPAGUS, you tore up that An|chor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic &s;tedfa&s;t and firm, again&s;t the Storms of popular Faction.</Q> On this Account, I farther mu&s;t allow, that <Q>not|with&s;tanding the Integrity which you pre&s;erved in your public Conduct, and the great Virtues which you exerted, your Place in <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> is ju&s;tly below that of tho&s;e, who have governed Repub|lics, or <HI>limited Monarchies,</HI> not merely with a Concern for their pre&s;ent Advan|tage; but with a prudent Regard to that <HI>Balance</HI> of <HI>Power,</HI> on which their <HI>per|manent Happine&s;s</HI> always depends.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you allow me this, it is all I contend for. What could remain farther to be ad|ju&s;ted in the Debate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of Opinion, that the Que&s;tion was decided in too general a Manner: And that for Want of a little more Particularity of Argument and Proof, Conclu&s;ions might be <HI>plau&s;ibly</HI> drawn, which would be very di&s;tant from the Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, explain your&s;elf a little farther, ARISTIDES; for as yet I do not clearly comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I mean is this: That Free States, or <HI>limited Monarchies,</HI> though they may greatly re&s;emble each other in their <HI>external Con&s;truction,</HI> may yet be &s;o very unlike in their <HI>internal Condition,</HI> that no ju&s;t Con|clu&s;ions
<PB N="12" REF="10">
could be drawn concerning their Pro&s;perity and Welfare, merely from their <HI>external Re&s;emblance.</HI> Thus we will &s;up|po&s;e two States to be equally <HI>free,</HI> in their legal Con&s;titution: But let us farther &s;up|po&s;e, that the <HI>Manners</HI> or <HI>Principles,</HI> which prevail in the&s;e two States are widely differ|ent; and, in that Ca&s;e, I apprehend, that if you regard only the legal <HI>Form</HI> of the Con&s;titution, without weighing the <HI>Man|ners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of the Members of the State, you will be in great Danger of im|po&s;ing <HI>fal&s;e Conclu&s;ions</HI> on your&s;elf and others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not force any of the&s;e Conclu&s;ions upon you. They are of your own making.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, you did not force them upon me: Yet they are not of my own making. For &s;ome of the <HI>Shades,</HI> who overheard your Conver&s;ation, have &s;ince told me, that the general Turn of your Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>oblique|ly led</HI> to the&s;e Conclu&s;ions; and therefore
<PB N="13" REF="11">
thought that it would become ARISTIDES to di&s;cu&s;s this Point with a little more Preci&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to hear any thing you have to &s;ay on this intere&s;ting Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will give me leave then, to examine &s;ome things that pa&s;&s;ed in your Di&s;cour&s;e with COSMO.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray be as free with them as you plea&s;e. I rely on the Candor as well as Ju&s;tice of ARISTIDES.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will endeavour to de&s;erve your favour|able Opinion. You may remember, you &s;aid <Q>That by weakening the Power of the Court of AREOPAGUS, you tore up that Anchor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic &s;tedfa&s;t and firm, again&s;t the
<PB N="14" REF="12">
Storms of popular Factions.</Q> This, I think, was the fir&s;t Foundation of your Ar|gument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it a &s;afe Practice, PERICLES, to build an Argument on a Metaphor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think it is; provided the Meta|phor contain a ju&s;t Image of the Fact in Que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I allow: but &s;till the Que&s;tion re|mains, whether the Metaphor contain that ju&s;t Image or not. So that we are not yet advanced a Step towards the Di&s;covery of Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>At lea&s;t it is an Illu&s;tration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I think it had better have come after the Di&s;covery. I believe I can give you another Metaphor which &s;hall lead di|rectly to the contrary Conclu&s;ion. 'Tis a wi&s;e Practice, you &s;ay, to keep fixed the <HI>Anchor.</HI> In general, I grant you, it is &s;o. Yet you know, that in Times of Tempe&s;t and Di&s;tre&s;s, the mo&s;t experienced Admiral, when anchored near a rocky Shore, is forced to <HI>&s;lip his Cables,</HI> and commit his Fleet to the <HI>wide Sea,</HI> till he can <HI>anchor</HI> on a <HI>&s;afer Bottom.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a dangerous Practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: and therefore never to be tryed, except in a Time of extreme Danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well: I will grant you that a Metaphor proves nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the only Purpo&s;e for which I in|tended mine. We will proceed, therefore, with our Argument. And the &s;um of what I have to &s;ay, will only tend to the Proof of this &s;ingle Point; <Q>That a <HI>free State,</HI> or <HI>limited Monarchy,</HI> re&s;embling that of <HI>Athens</HI> in it's external Form, may yet be &s;o differently circum&s;tanced in it's <HI>internal Condition,</HI> that a Conduct in many Re&s;pects &s;imilar to Yours, &s;hall be the only means of <HI>&s;aving</HI> that State from Ruin, though Your well meant Conduct led the State of <HI>Athens</HI> to it's <HI>De&s;truction.</HI></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems to me, ARISTIDES, that you undertake a Ta&s;k of no &s;mall Difficulty. Proceed: I am all Attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray tell me, PERICLES: Was the Court of the AREOPAGUS <HI>wi&s;e, courageous, uncorrupt,</HI> and bent upon the public Service in Oppo&s;i|tion to all &s;elf-intere&s;ted Views, when You &s;et about to le&s;&s;en it's Authority?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my Confu&s;ion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was. For in Fact; <Q>The annual <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> the <HI>Guardians</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> the <HI>Governors</HI> of the &s;acred <HI>Rites,</HI> and <HI>Chieftains</HI> in <HI>War,</HI> were all <HI>cho&s;en</HI> by <HI>Lot:</HI> and they who had acquitted them&s;elves <HI>well</HI> in the Di&s;charge of the&s;e <HI>Tru&s;ts,</HI> were advanced, and taken into the Court of the AREOPAGUS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in his Life of Pericles.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right in your Idea of this <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> Court. Tell me farther now. Was the Body of the Athenian Peo|ple <HI>&s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t,</HI> and <HI>united,</HI> when you threw your&s;elf into their Arms, and increa&s;|ed their Power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay much, either for their <HI>Good Sen&s;e,</HI> their <HI>Uprightne&s;s,</HI> or their <HI>Union</HI>; on the Contrary, I fear they were <HI>ignorant, &s;elf-intere&s;ted</HI> and <HI>di&s;united.</HI> Nay, I mu&s;t farther confe&s;s, that I my&s;elf was the Cau&s;e and Promoter of their Vices and Factious Temper. For I not only gain|ed and ruled them by my <HI>Eloquence,</HI> as I confe&s;&s;ed in my Conver&s;ation with COSMO; but <Q>by giving them the Plunder and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands taken from the Enemy, and by &s;quandering the public Monies (formerly re&s;erved for the U&s;es of War) in Shows and Plays for their Entertainment, and by giving them <HI>Large&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>Pen&s;ions,</HI> I brought them from a &s;ober, mode&s;t, and thrifty People, who main|tained them&s;elves by their own Labours, to become riotous and debauched through the&s;e mi&s;taken Methods of Policy: Thus it was that I turned them again&s;t the Court of the AREOPAGUS <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in his Life of Pericles.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="17">
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It gives me Plea&s;ure to find you &s;o much more full and explicit in this Affair, than you were in your Di&s;cour&s;e with COSMO. &mdash; So then, you took Power from a Body of Men, <HI>wi&s;e, di&s;intere&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>uncorrupt,</HI> to put it into the hands of Men <HI>ignorant, &s;elf-intere&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>factious.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too true: I did: <Q>Becau&s;e I knew that my Eloquence would (with the&s;e other Methods, &s;till <HI>more powerful</HI>) &s;ub|ject the People to me, and make them the In&s;truments of all my De&s;ires: where|as the AREOPAGUS had an Authority and a Dignity in it which I could not con|troul.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you &s;aid in your Di&s;cour&s;e with COSMO. Let us now rever&s;e the&s;e Facts, and &s;up|po&s;e the Court of the AREOPAGUS had de&s;ert|ed the Principles of their fir&s;t In&s;titution: That either <HI>Luxury,</HI> the Love of <HI>Gain,</HI> or a
<PB N="20" REF="18">
Spirit of fal&s;e <HI>Ambition,</HI> had crept in among them; and rendered them either <HI>incapable,</HI> and <HI>corrupt:</HI> And farther let us &s;up|po&s;e, that the Body of the People had been <HI>&s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t,</HI> and <HI>united:</HI> What had been the Con&s;equence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ca&s;e indeed had been altogether <HI>different.</HI> I would give all the Wreaths I ever was honoured with, to have built my Conduct on &s;o noble a Foundation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend your Wi&s;dom, though it comes too late. The Ca&s;e indeed had been not only altogether <HI>different,</HI> but altogether <HI>contrary.</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>de&s;troying</HI> the Com|monwealth, you had <HI>re&s;tored</HI> the tottering Fabrick. You had then taken Power from <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Corruption,</HI> to be&s;tow it on <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Integrity.</HI> And, depend upon it, in whatever Body of Men <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> are found, <HI>the&s;e are the Anchors of the State.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="19">
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Maxim looks plau&s;ible: Yet &s;till I cannot but regard it as a dangerous Prac|tice, to make a <HI>Breach</HI> in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution of a free State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I. And I think your Principle is &s;o far from <HI>overturning,</HI> that it <HI>confirms,</HI> my Argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That appears to me a &s;trange Paradox.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, PERICLES: Is not a <HI>Breach</HI> made in the political Con&s;titution of a free State, when it's whole&s;ome Laws and In&s;ti|tutions have lo&s;t their <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Efficacy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="20">
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can they &s;o entirely lo&s;e their Power and Efficacy, in any other Way, as by the <HI>Incapacity</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> of tho&s;e who <HI>govern?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow, they cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;ee, that upon Suppo&s;ition that the Court of the AREOPAGUS had lo&s;t their <HI>Ability</HI> or <HI>public Virtue,</HI> 'tis they who fir&s;t deprive the Laws of their <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Efficacy,</HI> and con&s;equently, 'tis they who make the <HI>Breach</HI> in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>This &s;eems to be true: But &s;till, why &s;hould the People follow their Example, and, by in&s;i&s;ting on <HI>extraordinary Powers</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> make a <HI>&s;econd Breach</HI> in the Con&s;titution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>O PERICLES, you view the Que&s;tion with a partial Eye: What you call a <HI>&s;econd Breach</HI> in the Con&s;titution is indeed no more than the natural Effort of the <HI>&s;ound Parts</HI> of the Body politic, to <HI>throw off</HI> the <HI>morbific Matter</HI> by which it is oppre&s;&s;ed. Thus in the natural Body, all Di&s;ea&s;es come to their Cri&s;is, and a Cure is effected by the Vigour and Activity of the uninfected Parts. Where|ever then the Di&s;ea&s;e lies, either in the Body politic, or the Body natural, the &s;ound Parts mu&s;t check and throw off that which is infected, or Death en&s;ues. &mdash; Thus, you &s;ee, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>People</HI> to be <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> and the Court of AREOPAGUS <HI>cor|rupted</HI> or <HI>incapable,</HI> the only Means of &s;av|ing the State is the Power which the Peo|ple have to <HI>check</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> the Court of the AREOPAGUS.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not this <HI>unhinging</HI> the Con&s;titu|tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from it, that it is the only Way of <HI>fixing</HI> it; by bringing it back to it's fir&s;t Principles. &mdash; How did this famed Con&s;ti|tution fir&s;t ari&s;e? Was it not by the united Con&s;ent of the &s;everal Ranks of the Com|munity, each of which had their &s;everal Privileges and Powers appropriated, on Con|dition of applying them to the public Good? The Court of the AREOPAGUS violates it's Engagements: The Voice of an hone&s;t and abu&s;ed People rouzes them from their fatal Dream: What is the natural Con&s;equence? Why, &s;urely, the Reformation of the Court of the AREOPAGUS. An <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> People never de&s;ires more than <HI>Redre&s;s</HI> of Grievances; and, when that is obtained, return <HI>chearfully</HI> to <HI>Subordination,</HI> and <HI>adore</HI> their <HI>Rulers.</HI></P>

<P>Every political State mu&s;t be, in &s;ome Degree, <HI>fluctuating</HI> and <HI>un&s;table,</HI> unle&s;s you

load it with the Chains of <HI>De&s;poti&s;m.</HI> But I maintain, that the <HI>be&s;t Security,</HI> nay the <HI>only</HI> one to a <HI>Free</HI> Government, lies in the upright <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of it's con|&s;tituent Members; and that, whenever there is any Deviation from the&s;e, the only Po&s;&s;i|bility of a Re&s;toration lies in the <HI>Prevalence</HI> of the <HI>&s;ound</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> Part over that which is <HI>corrupted,</HI> in <HI>whatever Part</HI> of the <HI>Community</HI> the <HI>Infection</HI> may lie; whether it be the Court of the AREOPAGUS, or the Body of the <HI>People.</HI> For, as it was truly ob&s;erved in your Di&s;cour&s;e with COSMO, <Q><HI>Force</HI> or <HI>Caprice</HI> may give <HI>(immediate</HI> and <HI>temporary)</HI> Power; but nothing can give a <HI>lu&s;ting Authority,</HI> except <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dialogues of the Dead, p. 242.</NOTE></Q>.</P>

<P>But is not this a dangerous Principle to in&s;till into the Body of the People, that they have a Right to controul the Errors of the Court of AREOPAGUS? Does it not lead to Sedition and Anarchy? And was not this the Con&s;equence of my mi&s;taken Con|duct?</P>

<SPEAKER>ARISTIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are now puzzling the Que&s;tion again by making it <HI>general.</HI> I reply then, that in your particular Ca&s;e, the Practice was <HI>dan|gerous</HI> and <HI>fatal</HI>; becau&s;e the Court of the AREOPAGUS was <HI>capable</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> the People of <HI>Athens</HI> were <HI>incapable, &s;elf-inter|e&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>factious.</HI> You therefore <HI>tore</HI> up the <HI>Anchor</HI> of the State.
