<P>DURING the infancy of a nation, every member depends on his own in|du&s;try for procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life: he is his own ma&s;on, his own taylor, his own phy&s;ician; and on him&s;elf he chiefly relies for offence as well as defence. Every &s;avage can &s;ay, what few beggars among us can &s;ay, <HI>Omnia mea mecum porto;</HI> and hence the apti|tude of a &s;avage for war, which makes little alte|ration in his manner of living. In early times accordingly, the men were all warriors, and every known art was exerci&s;ed by women; which is
<PB N="2" REF="6">
the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent of American &s;avages. And even after arts were &s;o much improved as to be exerci&s;ed by men, none who could bear arms were exempted from war. In feudal governments, the military &s;pirit was carried to a great height: all gentlemen were &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion; and every other art was de&s;pi&s;ed, as low, if not con|temptible.</P>
<P>Even in this untoward &s;tate, arts made &s;ome progre&s;s, not excepting tho&s;e for amu&s;ement; and many conveniencies, formerly unknown, became nece&s;&s;ary to comfortable living. A man cannot bear to be deprived of the conveniencies and amu&s;ements to which he is accu&s;tomed: he hates war, and clings to the &s;weets of peace. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of a military e&s;tabli&s;hment, hard|ening men by &s;trict di&s;cipline to endure the fa|tigues of war. By &s;tanding armies, war is carried on more regularly and &s;cientifically than in feudal governments; and as it is carried on with infinite|ly greater expence; nations are more re&s;erved in declaring war than formerly. Long experience has at the &s;ame time made it evident, that a nation &s;eldom gains by war; and that agriculture, ma|nufactures, and commerce, are the only &s;olid foundations of power and grandeur. The&s;e arts accordingly have become the chief objects of European governments, and the only rational cau|&s;es of war. Among the warlike nations of Greece and Italy, how would it have &s;ounded, that their effeminate de&s;cendants would employ &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion to fight their battles? And yet this is nece&s;&s;ary, in every country where arts and manu|factures flouri&s;h; which, requiring little exerci&s;e, tend to enervate the body, and of cour&s;e the mind. Gain, at the &s;ame time, being the &s;ole object of indu&s;try, advances &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and brings on a timid anxiety about
<PB N="3" REF="7">
property and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Cyrus, tho' flaming with re&s;entment again&s;t the Lydians for revolting, li&s;tened to the following &s;agacious ad|vice, offered by Croe&s;us, their former King. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Cyrus, de&s;troy not Sardis, an ancient city, famous for arts and arms; but, pardoning what is pa&s;t, demand all their arms, encourage lux|ury, and exhort them to in&s;truct their children in every art of gainful commerce. You will &s;oon &s;ee, O King, that in&s;tead of men, they will be women."</Q> The Arabians, a brave and generous people, conquered Spain, and drove into the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Bi&s;cay and Au&s;tria, the few natives who &s;tood out. When no longer an enemy appeared, they turned their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and became a rich and flouri&s;hing nation. The inhabitants of the mountains, hard|ened by poverty and &s;ituation, ventured, after a long interval, to peep out from their &s;trong-holds, and to lie in wait for &s;traggling parties. Finding them&s;elves now a match for a people, whom opu|lence had betrayed to luxury, and the arts of peace to cowardice; they took courage to di&s;play their banners in the open field; and after many military atchievements, &s;ucceeded in reconquering Spain. The Scots, inhabiting the mountainous parts of Caledonia, were an overmatch for the Picts, who occupied the fertile plains, and at la&s;t &s;ubdued them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the time that all Scotland was brought un|der one king, the highlanders, divided into tribes or clans, made war upon each other; and continued the &s;ame practice irregularly many ages after they &s;ubmit|ted to the king of Scotland. Open war was repre&s;&s;ed, but it went on privately by depredations and repri&s;als. The clan-&s;pirit was much depre&s;&s;ed by their bad &s;ucce&s;s in the rebellion 1715; and totally cru&s;hed after the re|bellion 1745. The mildne&s;s with which the highlan|ders have been treated of late, and the pains that have been taken to introduce indu&s;try among them, have to|tally extirpated depredations and repri&s;als, and have rendered them the mo&s;t peaceable people in Scotland; but have at the &s;ame time reduced their military &s;pirit to a low ebb. To train them for war, military di&s;|cipline has now become no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than to others.</NOTE>.</P>

Where arts, manufactures, and commerce, have arrived at perfection, a pacific &s;pirit pre|vails univer&s;ally: not a &s;park is left of military ardor, nor will any man be a &s;oldier. Hence in &s;uch a &s;tate, the nece&s;&s;ity of mercenary troops, hired among nations le&s;s effeminate, who fight for pay, not for the &s;tate they &s;erve. Benjamin de Tudele, a Spani&s;h Jew, who wrote in the twelfth century, reports, that the Greeks, by luxury and effeminacy, had contracted a degree of &s;oftne&s;s, that made them re&s;emble women more than men; and that the Greek Emperor was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing mercenary troops, to de|fend his country again&s;t the Turks. And accord|ingly when, in the year 1453, the city of Con|&s;tantinople, defended by a garri&s;on not exceeding 6000 men, was be&s;ieged by the Turks, and re|duced to extremity, not a &s;ingle inhabitant had courage to take up arms, all waiting with torpid de&s;pondence the hour of utter extirpation. Venice, Genoa, and other &s;mall Italian &s;tates, became &s;o effeminate by long and &s;ucce&s;sful commerce, that not a citizen ever thought of &s;erving in the army; which obliged them to employ mercenaries, offi|cers as well as private men. The&s;e mercenaries at fir&s;t fought con&s;cientiou&s;ly for their pay; but re|flecting, that the victors were not better paid than
<PB N="5" REF="9">
the vanqui&s;hed, they learned to play booty. In a battle particularly between the Pi&s;ans and Flo|rentines, which la&s;ted from &s;un-ri&s;ing to &s;un|&s;etting, there was but a &s;ingle man lo&s;t, who, having accidentally fallen from his hor&s;e, was trode under foot. Charles VIII. of France, when he invaded Italy <HI>anno</HI> 1498, under&s;tood nothing of &s;uch mock battles; and his men were held to be devils incarnate, who &s;eemed to take delight in &s;hedding human blood. The Dutch, who for many years have been reduced to mercenary troops, are more indebted to the mutual jea|lou&s;y of their neighbours for their indepen|dence, than to their own army. In the year 1672, Lewis of France invaded Holland, and in forty days took forty walled towns. That country was &s;aved, not by his army, but by being laid un|der water. Fro&s;t, which is u&s;ual at that &s;ea&s;on, would have put an end to the &s;even United Pro|vinces.</P>
<P>The &s;mall principality of Palmyra is the only in&s;tance known in hi&s;tory, where the military &s;pirit was not enervated by opulence. Pliny de|&s;cribes that country as extremely plea&s;ant, and ble&s;&s;ed with plenty of &s;prings, tho' &s;urrounded with dry and &s;andy de&s;erts. The commerce of the Indies was at that time carried on by land; and the city of Palmyra was the centre of that commerce between the Ea&s;t and the We&s;t. Its territory being very &s;mall, little more than &s;uffi|cient for villas and plea&s;ure-grounds, the inhabi|tants, like tho&s;e of Hamburgh, had no way to employ their riche&s;s for profit but in trade. At the &s;ame time, being &s;ituated between the two mighty empires of Rome and Parthia, it required great addre&s;s, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous military di&s;|cipline, to pre&s;erve the inhabitants from being &s;wallowed up by the one or the other. This
<PB N="6" REF="10">
tickli&s;h &s;ituation pre&s;erved them from luxury and effeminacy, the u&s;ual concomitants of riches. They made a better figure with their &s;uperfluous wealth: they laid it out on magnificent buildings, and adorning their country-&s;eats. The fine arts in general, were among them carried to a high degree of perfection. The famous Zenobia, their Queen, led captive to Rome after being de|prived of her dominions, was admired and cele|brated for &s;pirit, for learning, and for an exqui|&s;ite ta&s;te in the fine arts.</P>
<P>Thus, by accumulating wealth, a manufactur|ing and commercial people become a tempting object for conque&s;t; and by effeminacy become an ea&s;y conque&s;t. The military &s;pirit &s;eems to be much decayed in Britain; and ere it be gone, will no phantom appear, even in a dream, to di&s;turb our downy re&s;t? Formerly, the culture of corn in the temperate regions of Europe and A&s;ia, proved a tempting bait to northern &s;avages who wanted bread: have we no cau&s;e to dread a &s;imi|lar fate from &s;ome warlike neighbour, impelled by hunger, or by ambition, to extend his domi|nions? The difficulty of providing for defence, without hurting indu&s;try, has produced a general opinion among political writers, that a nation, if it will pre&s;erve its military &s;pirit, mu&s;t exclude indu&s;try; and, if it will pre&s;erve its indu&s;try, mu&s;t give up all hopes of retaining its military &s;pirit. In the former ca&s;e, we are &s;ecure again&s;t any invader: in the latter, we indeed make a con&s;iderable figure, but lie open to every invader. Happy would Britain be, could the &s;pirit of war and of commerce be made compatible by &s;ome mi|litary plan, that would protect us again&s;t enemies, without hurting our indu&s;try and manufactures. That &s;uch a plan is not ab&s;olutely impracticable, will, I hope, appear from what follows; tho'
<PB N="7" REF="11">
I am far from hoping that it will meet with uni|ver&s;al approbation. To prepare the reader, I &s;hall premi&s;e an account of the different military e&s;tabli&s;hments that exi&s;t, and have exi&s;ted, in Europe, with the advantages and di&s;advantages of each. In examining the&s;e, who knows whether &s;ome hint may not occur of a plan more perfect than any of them.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t illu&s;trious military e&s;tabli&s;hment of antiquity is that of the Romans, by which they &s;ubdued almo&s;t all the known world. The Roman citizens were many of them hu&s;bandmen, and all of them &s;oldiers. The inhabitants of Rome, in particular, lived upon their pay when in the field; but if they happened not to be &s;uc|ce&s;sful in plundering, they had no means of li|ving at home. An annual di&s;tribution of corn among them became nece&s;&s;ary, which in effect corre&s;ponded to the halfpay of our officers. It is believed, that &s;uch a con&s;titution would not be adopted by any modern &s;tate. It was a forc'd con&s;titution; contrary to nature, which gives different di&s;po&s;itions to men, in order to &s;upply hands for every nece&s;&s;ary art. It was, at the &s;ame time, extremely precarious, there being in it no medium between univer&s;al conque&s;t and the mo&s;t wretched &s;lavery. Had the Gauls, who conqured Rome, entertained any view but of plunder, Rome would never have been more heard of. It was on the brink of ruin in the war with Hannibal. What would have happened had Hannibal been victorious? It is ea&s;y to judge, by comparing it with Carthage. Carthage was a commercial &s;tate, the people all employ'd in arts, manufactures, and navigation. The Carthaginians were &s;ubdued; but they could not be reduced to extremity, while they had acce&s;s to the &s;ea. In fact, they pro|&s;pered &s;o much by commerce, even after they
<PB N="8" REF="12">
were &s;ubdued, as to rai&s;e jealou&s;y in their ma&s;ters, who thought them&s;elves not &s;ecure while a hou&s;e remained &s;tanding in Carthage. On the other hand, what re&s;ource for the inhabitants of Rome, had they been &s;ubdued? They mu&s;t have peri&s;h|ed by hunger; for they could not work. In a word, ancient Rome re&s;embles a game&s;ter who ventures all upon one deci&s;ive throw: if he lo&s;e, he is undone.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, that our feudal &s;y&s;tem will not have a &s;ingle vote. It was a &s;y&s;tem that led to confu&s;ion and anarchy, as little fitted for war as for peace. And as for mercenary troops, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to bring them again into the field, after what is &s;aid of them above.</P>
<P>The only remaining forms that merit attention, are a &s;tanding army, and a militia; which I &s;hall examine in their order, with the objections that lie again&s;t each. The fir&s;t &s;tanding army in modern times was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Charles VII. of France, on a very imperfect plan. By an edict <HI>anno</HI> 1448, he appointed each pari&s;h to furni&s;h an archer: the&s;e were termed <HI>franc-archers,</HI> becau&s;e they were exempted from all taxes. This little army was intended for re&s;toring peace and order at home, not for di&s;turbing neighbouring &s;tates. This good prince had been forced into many peri|lous wars, &s;ome of them for re&s;training the tur|bulent &s;pirit of his va&s;&s;als, and mo&s;t of them for defending his crown again&s;t a powerful adver&s;ary, Henry V. of England. As the&s;e wars were car|ried on in the feudal manner, the &s;oldiers, who had no pay, could not be re&s;trained from plunder|ing; and inveterate practice rendered them equal|ly licentious in peace and in war. Charles, to leave no pretext for free quarters, laid upon his
<PB N="9" REF="13">
&s;ubjects a &s;mall tax, &s;ufficient for regular pay to his little army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the fir&s;t tax impo&s;ed in France without con&s;ent of the three e&s;tates: and, however uncon&s;titu|tional, it occa&s;ioned not the &s;lighte&s;t murmur, becau&s;e the vi&s;ible good tendency of the tax reconciled all the world to it. Charles, be&s;ide, was a favourite of his people; and ju&s;tly, as he &s;hewed by every act his af|fection for them. Had our fir&s;t Charles been &s;uch a favourite, who knows, whether the taxes he impo&s;ed without con&s;ent of parliament, would have met with any oppo&s;ition? Such taxes would have become cu&s;to|mary, as in France; and a limited monarchy would, as in France, have become ab&s;olute. Governments, like men, are liable to many revolutions: we remain, it is true, a free people; but for that ble&s;&s;ing, we are perhaps more indebted to fortune, than to patriotic vigilance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t attempts are commonly crude and defec|tive. The franc-archers, di&s;per&s;ed one by one in different villages, and never collected but in time of action, could not ea&s;ily be brought under re|gular di&s;cipline. They were idle when not in the field; and in the field, they di&s;played nothing but vicious habits, a &s;pirit of lazine&s;s, of di&s;order, and of pilfering. Neither in peace were they of any u&s;e: their character of &s;oldier made them de&s;pi&s;e agriculture, without being qualified for war: in the army they were no better than pea&s;|ants: at the plough, no better than idle &s;oldiers. But in the hands of a monarch, a &s;tanding army is an in&s;trument of power, too valuable ever to be abandoned: if one &s;overeign entertain &s;uch an army, others in &s;elf-defence mu&s;t follow the ex|ample. Standing armies are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in every European &s;tate, and are brought to a com|petent degree of perfection.</P>
<P>This new in&s;trument of government, has pro|duced a wonderful change in manners. We now
<PB N="10" REF="14">
rely on a &s;tanding army, for defence as well as offence: none but tho&s;e who are trained to war, ever think of handling arms, or even of defending them&s;elves again&s;t an enemy: our people in ge|neral have become altogether effeminate, terrifi|ed at the very &s;ight of a ho&s;tile weapon. It is true, they are not the le&s;s qualified for the arts of peace; and if manufacturers be protected from being obliged to &s;erve in the army, I di&s;cover not any incompatibility between a &s;tanding army and the highe&s;t indu&s;try. Hu&s;bandmen at the &s;ame time make the be&s;t &s;oldiers: a military &s;pirit in the lower cla&s;&s;es ari&s;es from bodily &s;trength, and from affection to their natal &s;oil: both are emi|nent in the hu&s;bandman: con&s;tant exerci&s;e in the open air renders him hardy and robu&s;t; and fond|ne&s;s for the place where he finds comfort and plenty, attaches him to his country in general<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Numquam credo potui&s;&s;e dubitari, aptiorem armis ru&s;ticam plebem, quae &s;ub divo et in labore nutritur; &s;olis patiens; umbrae negligens; balnearum ne&s;cia; de|liciarum ignara; &s;implicis animi; parvo contenta; duratis ad omnem laborum tolerantiam membris: cui ge&s;tare ferrum, fo&s;&s;am ducere, onus ferre, con&s;uetudo de rure e&s;t.

Indeed, in the earlie&s;t ages of the commonwealth, while the city was in her infancy, the citizens marched out from the town to the field: but at that time they were not enfeebled by plea&s;ure, nor by luxury: The military youth, returning from their exerci&s;e and martial &s;ports, plunged into the Tyber to wa&s;h off the &s;weat and du&s;t of the field. The warrior and the hu&s;bandman were the &s;ame, they changed only the nature of their arms."]</Q></NOTE>. An arti&s;t or manufacturer, on the contrary, is
<PB N="11" REF="15">
attached to no country but where he finds the be&s;t bread; and a &s;edentary life, enervating his body, renders him pu&s;illanimous. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, among many, agriculture ought to be honoured and cheri&s;hed above all other arts. It is not only a fine preparation for war, by breeding men who love their country, and whom labour and &s;obriety fit for being &s;oldiers; but is al&s;o the be&s;t founda|tion for commerce, by furni&s;hing both food and materials to the indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>But &s;everal objections of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature occur again&s;t a &s;tanding army, that call aloud for a better model than has hitherto been e|&s;tabli&s;hed, at lea&s;t in Britain. The &s;ubject is of importance, and I hope for attention from every man who loves his country. During the vigour of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, which made every land-proprietor a &s;oldier, every inch of ground was te|naciou&s;ly di&s;puted with an invader: and while a &s;overeign retained any part of his dominions, he never lo&s;t hopes of recovering the whole. At pre&s;ent, we rely entirely on a &s;tanding army, for defence as well as offence, which has reduced e|very nation of Europe to a very precarious con|dition. If the army of a &s;tate happen to be de|feated,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
even at the mo&s;t di&s;tant frontier, there is little re&s;ource again&s;t a total conque&s;t. Compare the hi&s;tory of Charles VII. with that of Lewis XIV. Kings of France. The former, tho' dri|ven into a corner by Henry V. of England, and deprived of the bulk of his provinces, was howe|ver far from yielding: on the contrary, relying on the military &s;pirit of his people, and indefati|gably intent on &s;tratagem and &s;urpri&s;e, he reco|vered all he had lo&s;t. When Lewis XIV. &s;uc|ceeded to the crown, the military &s;pirit of the people, was contracted within the narrow &s;pan of a &s;tanding army. Behold the con&s;equence. That ambitious monarch, having provoked his neighbours into an alliance again&s;t him, had no re&s;ource again&s;t a more-numerous army, but to purcha&s;e peace by offering to abandon all his con|que&s;ts, upon which he had lavi&s;hed much blood and trea&s;ure<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Treaty of St. Gertrudenberg.</NOTE>. France at that period contain|ed &s;everal millions capable of bearing arms; and yet was not in a condition to make head again&s;t a di&s;ciplined army of 70,000 men. Poland, which continues upon the ancient military e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, wearied out Charles XII. of Sweden, and had done the &s;ame to &s;everal of his predece&s;|&s;ors. But Saxony, defended only by a &s;tanding army, could not hold out a &s;ingle day again&s;t the prince now mentioned, at the head of a greater army. Mercenary troops are a defence &s;till more feeble, again&s;t troops that fight for glory, or for their country. Unhappy was the invention of a &s;tanding army; which, without being any &s;trong bulwark again&s;t enemies, is a grievous burthen on the people; and turns daily more and more &s;o.

<P>But with re&s;pect to Britain, and every free nation, there is an objection &s;till more formida|ble; which is, that a &s;tanding army is dangerous to liberty. It avails very little to be &s;ecure again&s;t foreign enemies, &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;tanding army to af|ford &s;ecurity, if we have no &s;ecurity again&s;t an enemy at home. If a warlike king, heading his own troops, be ambitious to render him&s;elf ab&s;o|lute, there are no means to invade the impending blow; for what avail the greate&s;t number of effe|minate cowards again&s;t a di&s;ciplined army, de|voted to their prince, and ready implicitly to ex|ecute his commands? In a word, by relying en|tirely on a &s;tanding army, and by tru&s;ting the
<PB N="14" REF="18">
&s;word in the hands of men who abhor the re|&s;traint of civil laws, a &s;olid foundation is laid for military government. Thus a &s;tanding army is dangerous to liberty, and yet no &s;ufficient bul|wark again&s;t powerful neighbours.</P>
<P>Deeply &s;en&s;ible of the foregoing objections, Harrington propo&s;es a plan for a militia, which he holds to be unexceptionable. Every male be|tween eighteen and thirty, is to be trained to mi|litary exerci&s;es, by frequent meetings, where the youth are excited by premiums to contend in running, wre&s;tling, &s;hooting at a mark, &amp;c. &amp;c. But Harrington did not advert, that &s;uch meet|ings, enflaming the military &s;pirit, mu&s;t create an aver&s;ion in the people to dull and fatiguing la|bour. His plan evidently is incon&s;i&s;tent with in|du&s;try and manufactures: it would be &s;o at lea&s;t in Britain. A mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, plan it would be, were defence our &s;ole object; and not the le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, by rendering Britain &s;o poor as &s;carce to be a tempting conque&s;t. Our late war with France is a con&s;picuous in&s;tance of the power that can be exerted by a commercial &s;tate, entire in its credit; a power that amaz'd all the world, and our&s;elves no le&s;s than others. Politicians be|gin to con&s;ider Britain, and not France, to be the formidable power that threatens univer&s;al monar|chy. Had Harrington's plan been adopted, Bri|tain, like Sweden or Denmark, mu&s;t have been contented with an inferior &s;tation, having no am|bition but to draw &s;ub&s;idies from its more potent neighbours.</P>
<P>In Switzerland, it is true, boys are, from the age of twelve, exerci&s;ed in running, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting. Every male who can bear arms is regimented, and &s;ubjected to military di&s;cipline. Here is a militia in perfection upon Harrington's plan, a militia neither forced nor mercenary; in|vincible
<PB N="15" REF="19">
when fighting for their country: and as the Swi&s;s are by no means an idle people, we learn from this in&s;tance, that the martial &s;pirit is not an invincible ob&s;truction to indu&s;try. But the original barrenne&s;s of Switzerland, compel|led the inhabitants to be &s;ober and indu&s;trious: and indu&s;try hath among them become a &s;econd nature, there &s;carcely being a child above &s;ix years of age but who is employed, not excepting children of opulent families. England differs widely in the nature of its &s;oil, and of its peo|ple. At the &s;ame time, there is little occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t upon that difference; as Switzerland af|fords no clear evidence, that a militia gives no ob&s;truction to a &s;pirit of indu&s;try: the Swi&s;s, it is true, may be termed indu&s;trious; but their in|du&s;try is confined to nece&s;&s;aries and convenien|cies: they are le&s;s ambitious of wealth than of military glory; and they have few arts or ma|nufactures, either to &s;upport foreign commerce, or to excite luxury.</P>
<P>Fletcher of Salton's plan of a militia, differs little from that of Harrington. Three camps are to be con&s;tantly kept up in England, and a fourth in Scotland; into one or other of which, every man mu&s;t enter upon compleating his one and twentieth year. In the&s;e camps the art of war is to be acquired and practi&s;ed: tho&s;e who can maintain them&s;elves mu&s;t continue there two years, others but a &s;ingle year. Secondly, tho&s;e who have been thus educated, &s;hall for ever after have fifty yearly meetings, and &s;hall exerci&s;e four hours every meeting. It is not &s;aid, by what means young men are compelled to re&s;ort to the camp; nor is any exception mentioned of per&s;ons de&s;tined for the church, for liberal &s;ci|ences, or for the fine arts. The weak and the &s;ickly mu&s;t be exempted; and yet no regulation
<PB N="16" REF="20">
is propo&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who ab&s;ent them&s;elves on a fal&s;e pretext. But waving the&s;e, the capi|tal objection again&s;t Harrington's plan &s;trikes equally again&s;t Fletcher's, That by rou&s;ing a mi|litary &s;pirit, it would alienate the minds of the people from arts and manufactures, and from any con&s;tant and uniform occupation. The author him&s;elf remarks, that the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of arms, would make the youth place their honour upon that art, and would enflame them with love of military glory; not adverting, that love of military glory, diffu&s;ed through the whole ma&s;s of the people, would unqualify Britain for being a manufacturing and commercial country, rendering it of little weight or con&s;ideration in Europe.</P>
<P>The military branch is e&s;&s;ential to every &s;pe|cies of government: the Quakers are the only people who ever doubted of it. Is it not then mor|tifying, that a capital branch of government, &s;hould to this day remain in a &s;tate &s;o imperfect? One would &s;u&s;pect &s;ome inherent vice in the na|ture of government, that counteracts every effort of genius to produce a more perfect mode. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to admit any defect of Providence, e&s;pecially in an article e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of &s;ociety; and rather than yield to the charge, I venture to propo&s;e the following plan, even at the hazard of being thought an idle projector. And what animates me greatly to make the at|tempt is, a firm conviction, that a military and an indu&s;trious &s;pirit are of equal importance to Britain; and that if either of them be lo&s;t, we are undone. To reconcile the&s;e &s;eeming anta|goni&s;ts, is my chief view in the following plan; to which I &s;hall proceed, after paving the way by &s;ome preliminary con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21">
The fir&s;t is, that as military force is e&s;&s;ential to every &s;tate, no man is exempted from bearing arms for his country: all are bound; becau&s;e none can be bound, if every one be not bound. Were any difference to be made, per&s;ons of fi|gure and fortune ought fir&s;t to be called to that &s;ervice, as being the mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the wel|fare of their country.

It is a public calamity, from which the citizen has no means of &s;aving him&s;elf but by money; and it is con&s;equently the wor&s;t of all the re&s;ources of government. Would it not be more expedient to enact a law, obliging every man, whatever be his rank, to &s;erve his King and coun|try for five years? This law could not be di&s;ap|proved of, becau&s;e it is con&s;i&s;tent both with nature and ju&s;tice, that every citizen &s;hould be employed in the defence of the &s;tate.

<P>Take another preliminary con&s;ideration. While there remained any portion of our original mar|tial &s;pirit, the difficulty was not great of recruit|ing the army. But that ta&s;k hath of late years become extremely trouble&s;ome; and more di&s;a|greeable
<PB N="19" REF="23">
&s;till than trouble&s;ome, by the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing deceitful arts for trepanning the unwary youth. Nor are &s;uch arts always &s;ucce&s;sful: in our late war with France, we were nece&s;&s;itated to give up even the appearance of voluntary &s;er|vice, and to recruit the army on the &s;olid princi|ple of obliging every man to fight for his country: the ju&s;tices of peace were empowered by the le|gi&s;lature, to force into the &s;ervice &s;uch as could be be&s;t &s;pared from civil occupation. If a &s;ingle clau&s;e had been added, limiting the &s;ervice to five or &s;even years, the mea&s;ure would have been unexceptionable, even in a land of liberty. To relieve officers of the army from practi&s;ing de|ceitful arts for recruiting their corps, by &s;ub&s;ti|tuting a fair and con&s;titutional mode, was a valua|ble improvement. It was of importance with re|&s;pect to its direct intendment; but of much greater with re&s;pect to its con&s;equences. One of the few di&s;advantages of a free &s;tate, is licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s in the common people, who may wallow in di&s;order and profligacy without control, if they be but cautious to refrain from gro&s;s crimes, pu|ni&s;hable by law. Now, as it appears to me, there never has been devi&s;ed a method more ef|ficacious for re&s;toring indu&s;try and &s;obriety, than that under con&s;ideration. Its &s;alutary effects were con&s;picuous, even during the &s;hort time it &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted. The dread of being forced into the &s;er|vice, rendered the populace peaceable and order|ly: it did more; it rendered them indu&s;trious in order to conciliate favour. The mo&s;t beneficial di&s;coveries have been accidental: without having any view but for recruiting the army, our legi|&s;lature &s;tumbled upon an excellent method for re|claiming the idle and the profligate; a matter, in the pre&s;ent depravity of manners, of greater importance than any other that concerns the po|lice

of Britain. A perpetual law of that kind, by promoting indu&s;try, would prove a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t mobs and riots, di&s;ea&s;es of a free country, full of people and of manufactures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several late mobs in the &s;outh of England, all of them on pretext of &s;carcity, greatly alarmed the admi|ni&s;tration. A fact was di&s;covered by a private per&s;on <HI>(Six weeks tour through the &s;outh of England),</HI> which our mini&s;ters ought to have di&s;covered, that the&s;e mobs con&s;tantly happened where wages were high and pro|vi&s;ions low; con&s;equently that they were occa&s;ioned, not by want, but by wantonne&s;s.</NOTE>. Why were the foregoing &s;tatutes, for there were two of them, limited to a temporary exi&s;tence? There is not on record another &s;tatute better in|titled to immortality.</P>
<P>And now to the project, which, after all my efforts, I produce with trepidation; not that I doubt of its &s;olidity, but as ill &s;uited to the pre|&s;ent manners of this i&s;land. To hope that it will be put in practice, would indeed be highly ridi|culous: this can never happen, till patrioti&s;m flouri&s;h more in Britain than it has done for &s;ome time pa&s;t. Suppo&s;ing now an army of 60,000 men to be &s;ufficient for Britain, a rational me|thod for rai&s;ing &s;uch an army, were there no &s;tanding forces, would be, that land-proprietors, in proportion to their valued rents, &s;hould fur|ni&s;h men to &s;erve &s;even years, and no longer<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In Denmark, every land-proprietor of a certain rent, is obliged to furni&s;h a militia-man, whom he can withdraw at plea&s;ure upon &s;ub&s;tituting another; an ex|cellent method for taming the pea&s;ants, and for ren|dering them indu&s;trious.</NOTE>. But as it would be no le&s;s unju&s;t than imprudent, to di&s;band at once our pre&s;ent army, the &s;oft and natural way is, to begin with moulding gra|dually
<PB N="21" REF="25">
the old army into the new, by filling up vacancies with men bound to &s;erve &s;even years and no longer. And for rai&s;ing proper men, a matter of much delicacy, it is propo&s;ed, that in every &s;hire a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion be given to cer|tain landholders of rank and figure, to rai&s;e re|cruits out of the lower cla&s;&s;es, &s;electing always tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t u&s;eful at home.</P>
<P>Second. Tho&s;e who claim to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed af|ter &s;erving the appointed time, &s;hall never again be called to the &s;ervice, except in ca&s;e of an ac|tual inva&s;ion. Every one of them &s;hall be in|titled to a premium of eight or ten pounds, for enabling him to follow a trade or calling, with|out being &s;ubjected to corporation laws. The private men in France are inli&s;ted but for &s;ix years; and that mode has never been attended with any inconvenience.</P>
<P>Third. With re&s;pect to the private men, idlene&s;s mu&s;t be totally and for ever bani&s;hed. Suppo&s;ing three months yearly to be &s;ufficient for military di&s;cipline, the men, during the re&s;t of the year, ought to be employed upon public works, forming roads, erecting bridges, making rivers navigable, clearing harbours, &amp;c. &amp;c. Why not al&s;o furni&s;h men for half pay to private undertakers of u&s;eful works? And &s;uppo&s;ing the daily pay of a &s;oldier to be ten pence, it would greatly encourage exten&s;ive improvements, to have at command a number of &s;tout fellows, un|der &s;trict di&s;cipline, at the low wages of five pence a-day. An army of 60,000 men thus em|ployed, would not be &s;o expen&s;ive to the public, as 20,000 men upon the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment: for be&s;ide the money contributed by private un|dertakers, public works carried on by &s;oldiers,
<PB N="22" REF="26">
will be mi&s;erably ill contrived, if not cheaply purcha&s;ed with their pay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taking this for granted, I bring only into the cal|culation the pay of the three months &s;pent in military di&s;cipline; and the calculation is very &s;imple the pay of 20,000 for twelve months amounting to a greater &s;um than the pay of 60,000 for three months.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important branch of the project, is what regards the officers. The nece&s;&s;ity of re|viving in our people of rank &s;ome portion of mi|litary &s;pirit, will be acknowledged by every per&s;on of reflection; and in that view, the following articles are propo&s;ed. Fir&s;t: That there be two cla&s;&s;es of officers, one &s;erving for pay, one with|out pay. In filling up every vacant office of cor|net or en&s;ign, the latter are to be preferred; but in progre&s;&s;ive advancement, no di&s;tinction is to be made between the cla&s;&s;es. An officer who has &s;erved &s;even years without pay, may retire with honour.</P>
<P>Second. No man &s;hall be privileged to repre|&s;ent a county in parliament, who has not &s;erved &s;even years without pay; and, excepting an ac|tual burge&s;s, none but tho&s;e who have perform|ed that &s;ervice, &s;hall be privileged to repre&s;ent a borough. The &s;ame qualification &s;hall be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to every one who a&s;pires to &s;erve the public or the King in an office of dignity, ex|cepting only churchmen and lawyers, with regard to offices in their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions. In old Rome, none were admitted candidates for any civil employment, till they had &s;erved ten years in the army.</P>
<P>Third. Officers of this cla&s;s are to be exempt|ed from the taxes impo&s;ed on land, coaches, win|dows, and plate; not for &s;aving a trifling &s;um, but as a mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="27">
The military &s;pirit mu&s;t in Britain be mi&s;er|ably low, if &s;uch regulations prove not effectual to decorate the army with officers of figure and fortune. Nor need we to apprehend any bad con|&s;equence, from a number of raw officers who &s;erve without pay: among men of birth, emula|tion will have a more commanding influence than pay or profit; and at any rate, there will always be a &s;ufficiency of old experienced officers re|ceiving pay, ready to take the lead in every dif|ficult enterprize.</P>
<P>Fourth. To improve this army in military di&s;cipline, it is propo&s;ed, that when occa&s;ion of|fers, 5 or 6000 of them be maintained by Great Britain, as auxiliaries to &s;ome ally at war. And if that body be changed from time to time, knowledge and practice in war will be diffu&s;ed through the whole army.</P>
<P>Officers who &s;erve for pay, will be greatly be|nefited by this plan: frequent removes of tho&s;e who &s;erve without pay, make way for them; and from the very nature of the plan, buying and &s;elling is ab&s;olutely excluded.</P>
<P>I proceed to the alterations nece&s;&s;ary for ac|commodating this plan to our pre&s;ent military e&s;tabli&s;hment. As a total revolution at one in|&s;tant would breed confu&s;ion, the fir&s;t &s;tep ought to be a &s;pecimen only, &s;uch as the levying two or three regiments on the new model; the ex|pence of which ought not to be grudged, as the forces pre&s;ently in pay, are not &s;ufficient, even in peace, to an&s;wer the ordinary demands of go|vernment. And as the pro&s;pect of civil employ|ments, will excite more men of rank to offer their &s;ervice than there is room for, the choice mu&s;t be in the crown, not only with re&s;pect to the new regiments, but with re&s;pect to the vacant cornet|cies and en&s;igncies in the old army. But as the&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="28">
regulations will not in&s;tantly produce men qualified to be &s;ecretaries of &s;tate or commi&s;&s;ioners of trea&s;ury, &s;o numerous as to afford his maje&s;ty a &s;atisfactory choice, that branch of the plan may be &s;u&s;pended, till tho&s;e who have &s;erved &s;even years without pay, amount to one hundred at lea&s;t. The article that concerns members of par|liament mu&s;t be &s;till longer &s;u&s;pended: it may however, after the fir&s;t &s;even years, receive ex|ecution in part, by privileging tho&s;e who have received no pay to repre&s;ent a borough, refu&s;ing that privilege to others, except to actual burge&s;|&s;es. We may proceed one &s;tep farther, That if in a county there be five gentlemen who have the qualification under con&s;ideration, over and above the ordinary legal qualifications, one of the five mu&s;t be cho&s;en, leaving the electors free as to their other repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the private men of the old army, a thou&s;and of &s;uch as have &s;erved the longe&s;t may be di&s;banded annually, if &s;o many be willing to retire; and in their &s;tead an equal num|ber may be inli&s;ted, to &s;erve but &s;even years. Upon &s;uch a plan, it will not be difficult to find recruits.</P>
<P>The advantage of this plan, in one particular, is eminent. It will infallibly fill the army with gallant officers: Other advantages concerning the officers them&s;elves, &s;hall be mentioned afterward. An appetite for military glory cannot fail to be rou&s;ed in officers who &s;erve without pay, when their &s;ervice is the only pa&s;&s;port to employments of tru&s;t and honour. And may we not hope, that officers who &s;erve for pay, will, by force of imi|tation, be in&s;pired with the &s;ame appetite? No|thing ought to be more &s;edulou&s;ly inculcated into every officer, than to de&s;pi&s;e riches, as a mercan|tile object, below the dignity of a &s;oldier. Often
<PB N="25" REF="29">
has the courage of victorious troops been blunted by the pillage of an opulent city; and may not rich captures at &s;ea have the &s;ame effect? Some &s;ea-commanders have been &s;u&s;pected, of be&s;tow|ing their fire more willingly upon a merchantman, than upon a &s;hip of war. A triumph, an ovation, a civic crown, or &s;ome &s;uch mark of honour, were in old Rome the only rewards for military atchievements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Roman triumph was finely contrived to excite heroi&s;m; and a &s;ort of triumph not le&s;s &s;plendid, was di&s;played by the Fatemite Califs of Egypt.

Three days were commonly &s;pent in all manner of rejoicings, fea&s;ting, mu&s;ic, fireworks, &amp;c. He marched into the city with this great cavalcade, through roads covered with rich carpets, &s;trewed with flowers, gums, and odoriferous plants, and bedged on both &s;ides with crouds of congratulating &s;ubjects.</NOTE>. Money, it is true, was &s;ometimes di&s;tributed among the private men, as an addition to their pay, after a fatiguing campaign; but not as a recompence for their good behaviour, be|cau&s;e all &s;hared alike. It did not e&s;cape the pe|netrating Romans, that wealth, the parent of lux|ury and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, fails not to eradicate the mi|litary &s;pirit. The &s;oldier who to recover his bag|gage performed a bold action, gave an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to all governments. Being invited by his general to try his fortune a &s;econd time; Invite, &s;ays the &s;oldier, one who has lo&s;t his baggage. Many a bold adventurer goes to the Indies, who, returning with a fortune, is afraid of every breeze. Britain, I &s;u&s;pect, is too much infected with the &s;pirit of gain. Will it be thought ridiculous in

any man of figure, to prefer reputation and re|&s;pect before riches; provided only he can afford a frugal meal, and a warm garment? Let us compare an old officer, who never de&s;erted his friend nor his country, and a wealthy merchant, who never indulged a thought but of gain: the wealth is tempting;&mdash;and yet does there exi&s;t a man of &s;pirit, who would not be the officer rather than the merchant, even with his millions? Sultan Mechmet granted to the Jani&s;aries a pri|vilege of importing foreign commodities free of duty: was it his intention to metamorpho&s;e &s;ol|diers into merchants, loving peace, and hating war?</P>
<P>But though I declare again&s;t large appointments beforehand, which, in&s;tead of promoting &s;ervice, are a temptation to luxury and idlene&s;s; yet to an officer of character, who has &s;pent his younger years in &s;erving his king and country, a govern|ment, or other &s;uitable employment that enables him to pa&s;s the remainder of his life in ea&s;e and affluence, is a proper reward for merit, reflecting equal honour on the prince who be&s;tows, and on the &s;ubject who receives; be&s;ide affording an enlivening pro&s;pect to others, who have it at heart to do well.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the private men, the rotation propo&s;ed, aims at improvements far more impor|tant, than that of making military &s;ervice fall light upon individuals. It tends to unite the &s;pirit of indu&s;try with that of war, and to form the &s;ame man to be an indu&s;trious labourer, as well as a good &s;oldier. The continual exerci&s;e recom|mended, cannot fail to produce a &s;pirit of indu&s;|try; which will occa&s;ion a demand for the private men after their &s;even years &s;ervice, as valuable above all other labourers, not only for regularity, but for activity.

To men|tion no other works, &s;pacious and durable roads carried to the very extremities of that va&s;t em|pire, &s;how clearly how the &s;oldiers were employ|ed during peace; which hardened them for war, and made them orderly and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bergiere hi&s;toire des grands chemins, vol. 2. p. 152.</NOTE>. So e&s;&s;ential was labour held by the Romans for training an army, that they never ventured to face an enemy, with troops debilitated in any degree by idlene&s;s. The Roman army in Spain, having been wor&s;ted in &s;everal engagements, and confin|ed within their entrenchments, were &s;unk in idlene&s;s and luxury. Scipio Na&s;ica, after demo|li&s;hing Carthage, taking the command of that army, dur&s;t not oppo&s;e it to the enemy, till he accu&s;tomed the &s;oldiers to temperance and hard labour. He exerci&s;ed them without relaxation in marching and countermarching, in fortifying camps and demoli&s;hing them, in digging trenches and filling them up, in building high walls and pul|ling them down; he him&s;elf, from morning to night, going about, and directing every operation. Marius, before engaging the Cimbri, exerci&s;ed his army in turning the cour&s;e of a river. Ap|pian relates, that Antiochus, during his winter|quarters at Calchis, having married a beautiful virgin, with whom he was greatly enamoured, &s;pent the whole winter in plea&s;ure, abandoning his army to vice and idlene&s;s: and when the time

of action returned with the &s;pring, he found his &s;oldiers unfit for &s;ervice. The idlene&s;s of our &s;oldiers in time of peace, promoting debauchery and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, is no le&s;s de&s;tructive to health than to di&s;cipline. Unable for the fatigues of a fir&s;t campaign, our private men die in thou&s;ands, as if &s;mote with a pe&s;tilence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The idlene&s;s of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers appears from a tran&s;action of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the annexed e&s;tates in Scotland.

Hou&s;es were built for them, portions of land given them to cultivate at a very low rent, and maintenance afforded them till they could reap a crop. The&s;e men could not wi&s;h to be better accommodated: but &s;o ac|cu&s;tomed they had been to idlene&s;s, and change of place, as to be incapable of any &s;ort of work: they de&s;erted their farms one after another, and commenced thieves and beggars.

<P>That the military branch of the Briti&s;h govern|ment is &s;u&s;ceptible of improvements, all the world
<PB N="31" REF="35">
will admit. To improve it, I have contributed my mite; which is humbly &s;ubmitted to the public, a judge from whom there lies no appeal. It is &s;ubmitted in three views. The fir&s;t is, Whether an army, modelled as above, would not &s;ecure us again&s;t the bolde&s;t invader; the next, Whether &s;uch an army be as dangerous to liberty, as an army in its pre&s;ent form; and the la&s;t, Whether it would not be a &s;chool of indu&s;try and moderation to our people.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, we &s;hould, after a few years, have not only an army of &s;ixty-thou|&s;and well-di&s;ciplined troops, but the command of another army, equally numerous, and equally well di&s;ciplined. It is true, that troops inured to war have an advantage over troops that have not the &s;ame experience: but with a&s;&s;urance it may be pronounced impracticable, to land at once in Britain an army that can &s;tand again&s;t 100,000 Briti&s;h &s;oldiers well di&s;ciplined, fighting even their fir&s;t battle, for their country, and for their wives and children.</P>
<P>A war with France rai&s;es a panic on every &s;light threatening of an inva&s;ion. The &s;ecurity afforded by a propo&s;ed plan, would enable us to act offen&s;ively at &s;ea, in&s;tead of being reduced to keep our &s;hips at home, for guarding our coa&s;ts. Would Britain any longer be obliged to &s;upport her continental connections? No &s;ooner does an European prince augment his army, or improve military di&s;cipline, than his neighbours, taking fright, mu&s;t do the &s;ame. May not one hope, that by the plan propo&s;ed, or &s;ome &s;uch, Britain would be relieved from jealou&s;y and &s;olicitude a|bout its neighbours?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd view, having long enjoyed the &s;weets of a free government, under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mild princes, we begin to forget,
<PB N="32" REF="36">
that our liberties ever were in danger. But drou|&s;y &s;ecurity is of all conditions the mo&s;t dangerous; becau&s;e the &s;tate may be overwhelmed before we even dream of danger. Suppo&s;e only, that a Bri|ti&s;h King, accompli&s;hed in the art of war, and beloved by his &s;oldiers, heads his own troops in a war with France; and after more than one &s;uc|ce&s;sful campaign, gives peace to his enemy, on terms advantageous to his people: what &s;ecurity have we for our liberties, when he returns with a victorious army, devoted to his will? I am talk|ing of a &s;tanding army in its pre&s;ent form. Troops modelled as above will not be &s;o ob&s;equi|ous: a number of the prime nobility and gentry &s;erving without pay, who can be under no tempta|tion to en&s;lave them&s;elves and their country, will prove a firm barrier again&s;t the ambitious views of &s;uch a prince. And even &s;uppo&s;ing that army to be totally corrupted, the prince can have little hope of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the nation &s;upported by a|nother army, compo&s;ed of men, who, having completed their military &s;ervice, may be relied on as champions for their country.</P>
<P>And as to the la&s;t view mentioned, the plan propo&s;ed cannot fail to promote indu&s;try and vir|tue, not only among the &s;oldiers, but among the working people in general. To avoid hard la|bour and &s;evere di&s;cipline in the army, men will be &s;ober and indu&s;trious at home; and &s;uch un|tractable &s;pirits as cannot be reached by the mild laws of a free government, will be effectually tamed by military law. At the &s;ame time, as &s;o|briety and innocence are con&s;tant attendants upon indu&s;try, the manners of our people would be much purified; a circum&s;tance of infinite impor|tance to Britain. The &s;alutary influence of the plan would reach per&s;ons in a high &s;phere. A young gentleman, whipt at &s;chool, or falling be|hind
<PB N="33" REF="37">
at college, contracts an aver&s;ion to books; and flies to the army, where he is kept in coun|tenance by numbers, idle and ignorant like him|&s;elf. How many young men are thus daily ruin|ed, who, but for the temptation of idlene&s;s and gaiety in the army, would have become u&s;eful &s;ubjects! In the plan under con&s;ideration, the officers who &s;erve for pay would be &s;o few in number, and their pro&s;pect of advancement &s;o clear, that it would require much intere&s;t to be admitted into the army. None would be admit|ted but tho&s;e who had been regularly educated in every branch of military knowledge; and idle boys would be remitted to their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Here is di&s;played an agreeable &s;cene with rela|tion to indu&s;try. Suppo&s;ing the whole three&s;core thou&s;and men to be ab&s;olutely idle; yet, by dou|bling the indu&s;try of tho&s;e who remain, I affirm, that the &s;um of indu&s;try would be much greater than before. And the &s;cene becomes enchanting, when we con&s;ider, that the&s;e three&s;core thou&s;and men, would not only be of all the mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ous, but be patterns of indu&s;try to others.</P>
<P>Upon conclu&s;ion of a foreign war, we &s;uffer grievou&s;ly by di&s;banded &s;oldiers, who mu&s;t plun|der or &s;tarve. The pre&s;ent plan is an effectual remedy: men accu&s;tomed to hard labour under &s;trict di&s;cipline, can never be in want of bread: they will be &s;ought for every where, even at higher than ordinary wages; and they will prove excellent ma&s;ters for training the plea&s;ants to hard labour.</P>
<P>A man indulges emulation more freely in be|half of his friends or his country, than of him&s;elf: the latter is &s;elfi&s;h; the former proceeds from a &s;ocial principle. In that view, have we not rea|&s;on to hope, that the &s;eparating military officers into different cla&s;&s;es, will excite a laudable emu|lation,
<PB N="34" REF="38">
prompting individuals to exert them&s;elves on every occa&s;ion, for the honour of their corps? Nor will &s;uch emulation, a virtuous pa&s;&s;ion, be any ob&s;truction to private friend&s;hip between members of different cla&s;&s;es. On the contrary, may it not be expected, that young officers of birth and fortune, zealous to qualify them&s;elves, at their own expence, for &s;erving their country, will cling for in&s;truction to officers of experience, who have no inheritance but per&s;onal merit? Both find their account in that connection: men of rank become adepts in military affairs, a valua|ble branch of education for them; and officers who &s;erve for pay, acquire friends at court, who will embrace every opportunity of te&s;tifying their gratitude.</P>
<P>The advantages mentioned are great and ex|ten&s;ive; and yet are not the only advantages. Will it be thought extravagant to hope, that the propo&s;ed plan would form a better &s;y&s;tem of edu|cation for young men of fortune, than hitherto has been known in Britain? Before pronouncing &s;entence again&s;t me let the following con&s;idera|tions be duly weighed. Our youth go abroad to <HI>&s;ee</HI> the world in the literal &s;en&s;e; for to pierce deeper than eye-&s;ight, cannot be expected of boys. They re&s;ort to gay courts, where they find nothing for imitation but pomp, luxury, di&s;&s;embled virtues, and real vices: &s;uch &s;cenes make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on young men of a warm imagination. Our plan would be an antidote to &s;uch poi&s;onous education. Suppo&s;ing eighteen to be the earlie&s;t time for the army, here is an ob|ject held up to our youth of fortune, for rou&s;ing their ambition: they will endeavour to make a figure, and emulation will animate them to excel: &s;uppo&s;ing a young man to have no ambition, &s;hame alone will pu&s;h him on. To acquire the
<PB N="35" REF="39">
military art, to di&s;cipline their men, to direct the execution of public works, and to conduct other military operations, would occupy their whole time, and bani&s;h idlene&s;s. A young gentleman, thus guarded again&s;t the inticing vices and &s;aun|tering follies of youth, mu&s;t be &s;adly deficient in genius, if, during his &s;even years &s;ervice, reading and reflection have been totally neglected by him. Hoping better things from our youth of fortune, I take for granted, that during their &s;ervice they have made &s;ome progre&s;s, not only in military knowledge, but in morals, and in the fine arts, &s;o as at the age of twenty-five to be qualified for profiting, in&s;tead of being undone, by <HI>&s;eeing</HI> the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether hereditary nobility may not be nece&s;&s;ary in a monarchical government, to &s;upport the King, again&s;t the multitude, I take not on me to pronounce: but this I pronounce with a&s;&s;urance, that &s;uch a con|&s;titution is unhappy with re&s;pect to education; and appears to admit no remedy, if it be not that above mentioned, or &s;ome &s;uch. In fact, a few of tho&s;e who received their education while they were the el|de&s;t &s;ons of Peers, have been duly qualified to manage public affairs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Further, young men of birth and fortune, ac|quire indeed the &s;moothne&s;s and &s;upplene&s;s of a court, with re&s;pect to their &s;uperiors; but the con&s;traint of &s;uch manners, makes their temper break out again&s;t inferiors, where there is no con&s;traint. In&s;olence of rank is not &s;o vi&s;ible in Britain, as in countries of le&s;s freedom; but it is &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible to require correction. To that end, no method promi&s;es more &s;ucce&s;s than mili|tary &s;ervice; as command and obedience alter|nately, are the be&s;t di&s;cipline for acquiring tem|per and moderation. Can pride and in&s;olence be
<PB N="36" REF="40">
more effectually &s;temmed, than to be command|ed by an inferior?</P>
<P>Still upon the important article of education. Where plea&s;ure is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion in youth, intere&s;t will be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion in age: the &s;elf|i&s;h principle is the foundation of both, the object only is varied. This ob&s;ervation is &s;adly verified in Britain: our young men of rank, loathing an irk&s;ome and fatiguing cour&s;e of education, aban|don them&s;elves to plea&s;ure. Trace the&s;e very men through the more &s;edate part of life, and they will be found gra&s;ping at power and profit, by means of court-favour, with no regard to their country, and with very little regard to their friends. The education propo&s;ed, holding up a tempting prize to virtuous ambition, is an excel|lent fence again&s;t a life of indolent plea&s;ure. A youth of fortune, engaged with many rivals in a train of public &s;ervice, acquires a habit of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and as he is con&s;tantly employed for the public, patrioti&s;m becomes his ruling pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following portrait is &s;ketched by a good hand, (Madame Pompadour); and if it have any re&s;em|blance, it &s;ets our plan in a con&s;picuous light. The French noble&s;&s;e, &s;ays that lady, &s;pending their lives in di&s;&s;ipation and idlene&s;s, know as little of politics as of oeconomy. A gentleman hunts all his life in the coun|try, or perhaps comes to Paris to ruin him&s;elf with an opera-girl. Tho&s;e who are ambitious to be of the mi|ni&s;try, have &s;eldom any merit, if it be not in caballing and intrigue. The French noble&s;&s;e have courage, but without any genius for war, the fatigue of a &s;oldier's life being to them un&s;upportable. The king has been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing two &s;trangers for the &s;afety of his crown: had it not been for the Counts Saxe and Louendahl, the enemies of France might have laid &s;iege to Paris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="41">
The advantages of a military education, &s;uch as that propo&s;ed, are not yet exhau&s;ted: one of con&s;iderable importance remains to be unfolded. Under regular government promoting the arts of peace, &s;ocial intercour&s;e refines, and fondne&s;s for company increa&s;es in proportion. And hence it is, that the capital is crouded with every per&s;on who can afford to live there. A man of fortune, who has no ta&s;te but for a city life, happens to be forced into the country by bu&s;ine&s;s: finding bu&s;ine&s;s and the country equally in&s;ipid, he be|comes impatient, and returns to town, with a di&s;gu&s;t at every rural amu&s;ement. In-France, the country has been long de&s;erted: &s;uch fond|ne&s;s for &s;ociety prevails there, that &s;eldom has the King occa&s;ion to inflict a greater puni&s;hment on a man of fa&s;hion, than to bani&s;h him to his coun|try-&s;eat. In Britain the &s;ame fondne&s;s for a town-life is gaining ground daily. A &s;tranger con&s;idering the immen&s;e &s;ums expended in En|gland upon country-&s;eats, would conclude in ap|pearance with great certainty, that the Engli&s;h &s;pend mo&s;t of their time in the country. But how would it &s;urpri&s;e him to be told, not only that people of fa&s;hion in England pa&s;s little of their time in the country, but that the immen&s;e &s;ums laid out upon gardening and plea&s;ure|grounds, are the effect of vanity more than of ta&s;te! In fact, &s;uch embelli&s;hments are begin|ning to wear out of fa&s;hion; appetite for &s;ociety leaving neither time nor inclination for rural plea|&s;ures. If the progre&s;s of that di&s;ea&s;e can be &s;tayed, the only means is military education. In youth la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions are made; and men of fortune who take to the army, being confined mo&s;tly to the country in prime of life, contract a liking for country occupations and amu&s;ements; which withdraw them from the capital, and con|tribute
<PB N="38" REF="42">
to the health of the mind, no le&s;s than of the body.</P>
<P>A military education would contribute equally to moderation in &s;ocial enjoyments. The pomp, ceremony, and expence, nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who adhere to a court, and live always in public, are not a little fatiguing and oppre&s;&s;ive. Man is na|turally moderate in his de&s;ire of enjoyment; and it requires much practice to make him bear exce&s;s, without &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. The pain of exce&s;s, prompts men of opulence to pa&s;s &s;ome part of their time in a &s;nug retirement, where they live at ea&s;e, free from pomp and ceremony. Here is a retirement, which can be reached without any painful circuit; a port of &s;afety and of peace, to which we are piloted by military education, avoiding every dangerous rock, and every fati|guing agitation.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the advantages of military educa|tion above di&s;played, is it fooli&s;h to think, that our plan might produce a total alteration of man|ners in our youth of birth and fortune? The idlers, the game&s;ters, the profligate, compared with our military men, would make a de&s;picable figure: &s;hame, not to talk of pride, would compel them to reform.</P>
<P>How conducive to good government might the propo&s;ed plan be, in the hands of a virtuous king, &s;upported by a public-&s;pirited mini&s;try! In the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of advancement, a youth of qua|lity who a&s;pires to &s;erve his country in a civil em|ployment, has nothing to rely on but parliamenta|ry intere&s;t. The military education propo&s;ed, would afford him opportunity to improve his ta|lents, and to convince the world of his merit. Honour and applau&s;e thus acquired, would intitle him to demand preferment; and he ought to be employed, not only as de&s;erving, but as an en|neglecting
<PB N="39" REF="43">
couragement to others. Frequent in&s;tances of neglecting men who are patronized by the public, might perhaps prove dangerous to a Briti&s;h mini|&s;ter.</P>
<P>If I have not all this while been dreaming, here are di&s;played illu&s;trious advantages of the military education propo&s;ed. Fondne&s;s for the &s;ubject excites me to prolong the entertainment; and I add the following reflection, on the education of &s;uch men as are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve in a public &s;ta|tion. The &s;ciences are mutually connected; and a man cannot be perfect in any one, without be|ing in &s;ome degree acquainted with every one. The &s;cience of politics, in particular, being not a little intricate, cannot be acquired in perfection by any one who&s;e &s;tudies have been confined to a &s;ingle branch, whether relative to peace or to war. The Duke of Marlborough made an eminent figure in the cabinet, as well as in the field; and &s;uch was equally the illu&s;trious Sully, who may &s;erve as a model to all mini&s;ters. The great aim in modern politics is, to &s;plit government into the greate&s;t number po&s;&s;ible of departments, tru&s;ting nothing to genius. China is a complete model of &s;uch a government. National affairs are there &s;o &s;implified by divi&s;ion, as to require &s;carce any capacity in the mandarines. The&s;e officers, having little occa&s;ion for activity, either of mind or of body, &s;ink down into &s;loth and &s;en&s;uality: motives of ambition or of fame make no impre&s;&s;ion: they have not even &s;o much delicacy as to blu&s;h when they err: and as they regard no puni&s;hment but what touches the per&s;on or the pur&s;e, it is not un|u&s;ual to &s;ee a mandarine beaten with many &s;tripes, &s;ometimes for a very &s;light tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Let arts be &s;ubdivided into many parts; the more &s;ub|divi&s;ions the better: but I venture to pronounce, that no man ever did, nor ever will, make a capi|tal

<HEAD>PUBLIC POLICE with re&s;pect to the POOR.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e nations of Europe where government is a &s;cience, that part of public police which concerns the poor, makes now a con|&s;iderable branch of &s;tatute-law. The poor-laws are &s;o multiplied, and &s;o anxiou&s;ly framed, as to move one to think, that there cannot remain a &s;ingle per&s;on wanting bread. It is however a &s;ad truth, that the di&s;ea&s;e of poverty, in&s;tead of be|ing eradicated, has become more and more inve|terate. England in particular overflows with beg|gars, tho' in no other country are the indigent &s;o amply provided for. Some radical defect there mu&s;t be in the&s;e laws, when, after endle&s;s attempts to perfect them, they all prove abortive. Every writer, di&s;&s;atisfied with former plans, fails not to produce one of his own; which, in its turn, meets with as little approbation as any of the foregoing.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t regulation of the &s;tates of Holland concerning the poor, was in the year 1614, pro|hibiting all begging. The next was in the year 1649. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is enacted, That every town, vil|lage,
<PB N="42" REF="46">
or pari&s;h, &s;hall maintain its poor out of the income of its charitable foundations and collections; and in ca&s;e the&s;e means fall &s;hort, the magi&s;trates &s;hall maintain them at the ge|neral expence of the inhabitants, as can mo&s;t conveniently be done: Provided always, that the poor be obliged to work either for mer|chants, farmers, or others, for rea&s;onable wages, in order that they may, as far as po&s;|&s;ible, be &s;upported that way; provided al&s;o, that they be indulged in no idlene&s;s nor in&s;o|lence."</Q> The advice or in&s;truction here given to magi&s;trates, is &s;en&s;ible; but falls &s;hort greatly of what may be termed a <HI>law,</HI> the execution of which can be inforced in a court of ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P>In France, the precarious charity of mona&s;te|ries proving ineffectual, a ho&s;pital was erected in the city of Paris <HI>anno</HI> 1656, having different apartments; one for the innocent poor, one for putting vagabonds to hard labour, one for found|lings, and one for the &s;ick and maimed; with certain funds for defraying the expence of each, which produce annually much about the &s;ame &s;um. In imitation of Paris, ho&s;pitals of the &s;ame kind were erected in every great town of the king|dom.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h began more early to think of their poor; and in a country without indu&s;try, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity probably aro&s;e more early. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;tatute bears date in the year 1496, di|recting, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That every beggar unable to work, &s;hall re&s;ort to the hundred where he la&s;t dwelt or was born; and there &s;hall remain, upon pain of being &s;et in the &s;tocks three days and nights, with only bread and water, and then &s;hall be put out of town."</Q> This was a law again&s;t vagrants, for the &s;ake of order. There
<PB N="43" REF="47">
was little occa&s;ion, at that period, to provide for the innocent poor; their maintenance being a burden upon mona&s;teries. But mona&s;teries being put down by Henry VIII. there was a &s;tatute, 22d year of his reign, cap. 12. impowering the ju&s;ti|ces of every county, to grant licences to poor aged and impotent per&s;ons, to beg within a certain di&s;trict; tho&s;e who beg without it, to be whipt, or &s;et in the &s;tocks. In the fir&s;t year of Edward VI. cap. 3. a &s;tatute was made in favour of im|potent, maimed, and aged per&s;ons, that they &s;hall have convenient hou&s;es provided for them, in the cities or towns where they were born, or where they re&s;ided for three years, to be relieved by the <HI>willing and charitable di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the pari&s;hioners. By 2d and 3d Philip and Mary, cap. 5. the former &s;tatutes of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. were confirmed, of gathering weekly relief for the poor by charitable collections. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A man licenced to beg, &s;hall wear a badge on his brea&s;t and back openly."</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t compul&s;ory &s;tatute was 5^o Eli&s;ab. cap. 3. empowering ju&s;tices of peace to rai&s;e a weekly &s;um for the poor, by taxing &s;uch per|&s;ons as ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to contribute, after re|peated admonitions from the pulpit. In the next &s;tatute, 14^o Eli&s;ab. cap. 5. a bolder &s;tep was made, impowering ju&s;tices to tax the inha|bitants of every pari&s;h, in a weekly &s;um for their poor. And taxations for the poor being now in &s;ome degree familiar, the remarkable &s;tatutes, 39^o Eli&s;ab. cap. 3. and 43^o Eli&s;ab. cap. 2. were enacted, which make the ground-work of all the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes concerning the poor. By the&s;e &s;tatutes, certain hou&s;e-holders, named by the ju&s;tices, are, in conjunction with the church-wardens, appointed over&s;eers for the poor; and the&s;e over&s;eers, with con&s;ent of two ju&s;tices,
<PB N="44" REF="48">
are empowered to tax the pari&s;h in what &s;ums they think proper, for maintaining the poor.</P>
<P>Among a people &s;o tenacious of liberty as the Engli&s;h are, and &s;o impatient of oppre&s;&s;ion, is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, to find a law, that, without cere|mony, &s;ubjects individuals to the arbitrary will of men, who &s;eldom either by birth or education de|&s;erve that important tru&s;t; and without even pro|viding any effectual check again&s;t embezzlement? At pre&s;ent, a Briti&s;h parliament would reject with &s;corn &s;uch an ab&s;urd plan; and yet, being familiarized to it, they never &s;eriou&s;ly have at|tempted a repeal. We have been always on the watch to prevent the &s;overeign's encroachments, e&s;pecially with regard to taxes: but as pari&s;h-officers are low per&s;ons who in&s;pire no dread, we &s;ubmit to have our pockets picked by them, almo&s;t without repining. There is provided, it is true, an appeal to the general &s;e&s;&s;ions for re|dre&s;&s;ing inequalities in taxing the pari&s;hioners: but it is no effectual remedy; artful over&s;eers will not over-rate any man &s;o gro&s;sly as to make it his intere&s;t to complain, con&s;idering that the&s;e over&s;eers have the poor's money to defend them|&s;elves with. Nor will the general &s;e&s;&s;ions readily li&s;ten to a complaint, that cannot be verified but with much time and trouble. If the appeal have any effect, it will make a &s;till greater inequality, by relieving men of figure at the expence of their inferiors; who mu&s;t &s;ubmit, having little intere&s;t to obtain redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h plan, be&s;ide being oppre&s;&s;ive, is gro&s;sly unju&s;t. If it &s;hould be reported of &s;ome di&s;tant nation, that the burden of maintaining the idle and profligate, is laid upon the frugal and in|du&s;trious, who work hard for a maintenance to them&s;elves; what would one think of &s;uch a na|tion? Yet this is literally the ca&s;e of England.
<PB N="45" REF="49">
I &s;ay more: the plan is not only oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t, but mi&s;erably defective in the checking of mal-admini&s;tration. In fact, great &s;ums are levied beyond what the poor receive: it requires brigu|ing to be named a church-warden: the nominati|on, in London e&s;pecially, gives him credit at once; and however meagre at the commencement of his office, he is round and plump before it ends. To wax fat and rich by robbing the poor! Let us turn our eyes from a &s;cene &s;o hor|rid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the pari&s;h of St. George, Hanover Square, a great reform was made &s;ome years ago. Inhabitants of figure, not excepting men of the highe&s;t rank, take it in turn to be church-wardens; which has reduced the poor-rates in that pari&s;h to a trifle. But people, after acquiring a name, &s;oon tire of drudging for others. The drudgery will be left to low people as formerly, and the tax will again ri&s;e as high in that pari&s;h as in others. The poor-rates, in Dr. Davenant's time, were about L 700,000 yearly: at pre&s;ent they amount to be|tween two and three millions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Inequality in taxing, and embezzlement of the money levied, which are notorious, poi&s;on the minds of the people; and impre&s;s them with a notion, that all taxes rai&s;ed by public authority are ill managed.</P>
<P>The&s;e evils are great, and yet are but &s;light compared with what follow. As the number of poor in England, as well as the expence of main|tenance, are increa&s;ing daily, proprietors of land, in order to be relieved of a burden &s;o grievous, drive the poor out of the pari&s;h, and prevent all per&s;ons from &s;ettling in it who are likely to be|come a burden: cottages are demoli&s;hed, and marriage ob&s;tructed. Influenced by the pre&s;ent
<PB N="46" REF="50">
evil, they look not forward to depopulation, nor to the downfall of hu&s;bandary and manufactures by &s;carcity of hands. Every pari&s;h is in a &s;tate of war with every other pari&s;h, concerning pauper &s;ettlements and removals.</P>
<P>The price of labour is generally the &s;ame in the different &s;hires of Scotland, and in the different pari&s;hes. A few exceptions are occa&s;ioned by the neighbourhood of a great town, or by &s;ome ex|ten&s;ive manufacture that requires many hands. In Scotland, the price of labour re&s;embles water, which alway levels it&s;elf: if high in any one corner, an influx of hands brings it down. The price of labour varies in every pari&s;h of England. A labourer who has gained a &s;ettlement in a pari&s;h, on which he depends for bread when he inclines to be idle, dares not remove to another pari&s;h where wages are higher, fearing to be cut out of a &s;ettlement altogether. England is in the &s;ame condition with re&s;pect to labour, that France lately was with re&s;pect to corn; which, however plentiful in one province, could not be exported to &s;upply the wants of another. The pernicious effects of the latter with re&s;pect to food, are not more obvious, than of the former with re&s;pect to manufactures.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h manufactures labour under a &s;till greater hard&s;hip than inequality of wages. In a country where there is no fund for the poor but what nature provides, the labourer mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with &s;uch wages as are cu&s;tomary: he has no re|&s;ource; for pity is not moved by idlene&s;s. In England, the labourers command the market: if not &s;atisfied with cu&s;tomary wages, they have an excellent re&s;ource; which is, to abandon work altogether, and to put them&s;elves on the pari&s;h. Labour is much cheaper in France than in Eng|land: I have heard &s;everal plau&s;ible rea&s;ons; but
<PB N="47" REF="51">
in my opinion, the difference ari&s;es from the poor|laws. In England, every man is entitled to be idle; and every idler is entitled to a maintenance. In France, the funds appropriated to the poor, yield the &s;ame &s;um annually: that &s;um is always pre-occupied; and France, with re&s;pect to all but tho&s;e on the li&s;t, approaches to the &s;tate of a nation that has no fund provided by law for the poor.</P>
<P>Depopulation, inequality in the price of labour, and extravagant wages, are deplorable evils. But the Engli&s;h poor-laws are productive of evils &s;till more deplorable: they are &s;ubver&s;ive both of morality and indu&s;try. This is a heavy charge, but no le&s;s true than heavy. Fear of want is the only effectual motive to indu&s;try with the labour|ing poor: remove that fear, and they cea&s;e to be indu&s;trious. The ruling pa&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who live by bodily labour, is to &s;ave a pittance for their children, and for &s;upporting them&s;elves in old age: &s;timulated by de&s;ire of accompli&s;hing the&s;e ends, they are frugal and indu&s;trious; and the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s is to them a continual fea&s;t. Now what wor&s;e can malice invent again&s;t &s;uch a man, under colour of friend&s;hip, than to &s;ecure bread to him and his children whenever he takes a di&s;like to work; which effectually deadens his &s;ole ambition, and with it his hone&s;t indu&s;try? Relying on the certainty of a provi&s;ion again&s;t want, he relaxes gradually till he &s;ink into idle|ne&s;s: idlene&s;s leads to profligacy: profligacy be|gets di&s;ea&s;es: and the wretch becomes an object of public charity before he has run half his cour&s;e. Such are the genuine effects of the Engli&s;h tax for the poor, under a mi&s;taken notion of charity. There never was known in any country, a &s;cheme for the poor more contradictory to &s;ound policy. Might it not have been fore&s;een, that to a grovel|ing
<PB N="48" REF="52">
creature, who has no &s;en&s;e of honour, and &s;carce any of &s;hame, the certainty of mainte|nance would prove an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to idlene&s;s and debauchery? The poor-hou&s;e at Lyons contained originally but forty beds, of which twenty only were occupied. The eight hundred beds it contains at pre&s;ent, are not &s;uffi|cient for the poor who demand admittance. A premium is not more &s;ucce&s;sful in any ca&s;e, than where it is given to promote idlene&s;s. A hou&s;e for the poor was erected in a French village, the revenue of which, by oeconomy, became con|&s;iderable. Upon a repre&s;entation by the curate of the pari&s;h, that more beds were nece&s;&s;ary, the proprietor undertook the management. He &s;old the hou&s;e, with the furniture; and to every proper object of charity, he ordered a moderate proportion of bread and beef. The poor and &s;ick were more comfortably lodged at home, than formerly in the poor-hou&s;e. And by that plan of management, the pari&s;h-poor decrea&s;ed, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, as at Lyons. How few Engli&s;h manufacturers labour the whole week, if the work of four or five days afford them mainte|nance? Is not this a demon&s;tration, that the malady of idlene&s;s is widely &s;pread? In Bri&s;tol, the pari&s;h-poor twenty years ago did not exceed four thou&s;and: at pre&s;ent, they amount to more than ten thou&s;and. But as a malady, when left to it&s;elf, commonly effectuates its own cure; &s;o it will happen in this ca&s;e: when, by prevailing idlene&s;s, every one without &s;hame claims pari&s;h-charity, the burden will become intolerable, and the poor will be left to their &s;hifts.</P>
<P>The immoral effects of public charity are not confined to tho&s;e who depend on it, but extend to their children. The con&s;tant anxiety of a labour|ing man to provide for his children, endears them
<PB N="49" REF="53">
to him. Being relieved of that anxiety by the tax for the poor, his affection cools gradually, and he turns at la&s;t perfectly indifferent about them. Their independence, on the other hand, weans them from their duty to him. And thus, affection between parent and child, which is the corner-&s;tone of &s;ociety, is in a great mea&s;ure ob|literated among the labouring poor. In a plan publi&s;hed by the Earl of Hill&s;borough, there is an article, obliging parents to maintain their indigent children, and children to maintain their indigent parents. Natural affection mu&s;t indeed be at a low ebb, where &s;uch a regulation is nece&s;&s;ary: but it is nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t in London, where it is common to &s;ee men in good bu&s;ine&s;s neglect|ing their aged and di&s;ea&s;ed parents, for no better rea&s;on, than that the pari&s;h is bound to find them bread: <HI>Proh tempora, proh mores!</HI></P>
<P>The immoral effects of public charity &s;pread &s;till wider. It fails not to extingui&s;h the virtue of charity among the rich; who never think of giving charity, when the public undertakes for all. In a &s;cheme publi&s;hed by Mr. Hay, one ar|ticle is, to rai&s;e a &s;tock for the poor by voluntary contributions, and to make up the deficiency by a pari&s;h-tax. Will individuals ever contribute, when it is not to relieve the poor, but to relieve the pari&s;h? Every ho&s;pital has a poor-box, which &s;eldom produces any thing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One exception I am fond to mention. The poor|box of Edinburgh infirmary was neglected two or three years, little being expected from it. When opened, &pound;74 were found in it; be&s;ide a few &s;hillings and half|pence, contributed probably by the lower &s;ort, who were a&s;hamed to give their mite publicly.</NOTE>. The great comfort of &s;ociety is a&s;&s;i&s;tance in time of need;
<PB N="50" REF="54">
and its firme&s;t cement is, the be&s;towing and re|ceiving kindly offices, e&s;pecially in di&s;tre&s;s. Now to unhinge or &s;u&s;pend the exerci&s;e of chari|ty, by rendering it unnece&s;&s;ary, relaxes every &s;o|cial virtue, by &s;upplanting the chief of them. The con&s;equence is di&s;mal: exerci&s;e of benevo|lence to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed is our &s;ure&s;t guard again&s;t the encroachments of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s: if that guard be withdrawn, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will prevail, and become the ruling pa&s;&s;ion. In fact, the tax for the poor has contributed greatly to the growth of that gro|veling pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o con&s;picuous at pre&s;ent in En|gland.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h authors who turn their thoughts to the poor, make heavy complaints of decaying chari|ty, and increa&s;ing poverty: never once drea|ming, that the&s;e are the genuine effects of a legal provi&s;ion for the poor; which on the one hand eradicates the virtue of charity, and on the other is a violent temptation to idlene&s;s. Wonderfully ill contrived mu&s;t the Engli&s;h charity-laws be, when their con&s;equences are to &s;ap the foundati|on of voluntary charity; to deprive the labour|ing poor of their chief comfort, that of providing for them&s;elves and children; to relax mutual af|fection between parent and child; and to reward, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing, idlene&s;s and vice. Con&s;ider whether a legal provi&s;ion for the poor, be &s;uffici|ent to atone for &s;o many evils.</P>
<P>No man had better opportunity than Fielding to be acquainted with the &s;tate of the poor: let us li&s;ten to him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the poor are a very great burden, and even a nui&s;ance to the kingdom; that the laws for relieving their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and re&s;training their vices, have not an&s;wered; and that they are at pre&s;ent very ill provided for, and much wor&s;e governed, are truths which every one will acknowledge. Every
<PB N="51" REF="55">
per&s;on who hath property, mu&s;t feel the weight of the tax that is levied for the poor; and every per&s;on of under&s;tanding, mu&s;t &s;ee how ab&s;urdly it is applied. So u&s;ele&s;s indeed is this heavy tax, and &s;o wretched its di&s;po&s;i|tion, that it is a que&s;tion, whether the poor or rich are actually more di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;ince the plunder of the one &s;erves &s;o little to the real advantage of the other: for while a million yearly is rai&s;ed among the rich, many of the poor are &s;tarved; many more langui&s;h in want and mi&s;ery; of the re&s;t, numbers are found begging or pilfering in the &s;treets to|day, and to-morrow are locked up in goals and Bridewells. If we were to make a pro|gre&s;s through the out&s;kirts of the metropolis, and look into the habitations of the poor, we &s;hould there behold &s;uch pictures of human mi&s;ery, as mu&s;t move the compa&s;&s;ion of every heart that de&s;erves the name of human. What indeed mu&s;t be his compo&s;ition, who could &s;ee whole families in want of every ne|ce&s;&s;ary of life, oppre&s;&s;ed with hunger, cold, nakedne&s;s, and filth; and with di&s;ea&s;es, the certain con&s;equence of all the&s;e! The &s;uffe|rings indeed of the poor are le&s;s known than their mi&s;deeds; and therefore we are le&s;s apt to pity them. They &s;tarve, and freeze, and rot, among them&s;elves; but they beg, and &s;teal, and rob, among their betters. There is not a pari&s;h in the liberty of We&s;tmin&s;ter, which doth not rai&s;e thou&s;ands annually for the poor; and there is not a &s;treet in that liberty, which doth not &s;warm all day with beggars, and all night with thieves."</Q></P>
<P>There is not a &s;ingle beggar to be &s;een in Pen|&s;ylvania. Luxury and idlene&s;s have got no footing
<PB N="52" REF="56">
in that happy country; and tho&s;e who &s;uffer by misfortune, have their maintenance out of the public trea&s;ury. But luxury and idlene&s;s cannot for ever be excluded; and when they take place, this regulation will be as pernicious in Pen&s;ylva|nia, as the poor-rates are in Britain.</P>
<P>Of the many propo&s;als that have been pub|li&s;hed for reforming the poor-laws, not one has pierced to the root of the evil. None of the au|thors entertain the &s;lighte&s;t doubt, of a legal pro|vi&s;ion being nece&s;&s;ary, tho' all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es ari&s;e evidently from that very cau&s;e. Travellers com|plain, of being infe&s;ted with an endle&s;s number of beggars in every Engli&s;h town; a very different &s;cene from what they meet with in Holland or Switzerland. How would it &s;urpri&s;e them to be told, that this proceeds from an overflow of cha|rity in the good people of England!</P>
<P>Few in&s;titutions are more tickli&s;h than tho&s;e of charity. In London, common pro&s;titutes are treated with &s;ingular humanity: a ho&s;pital for them when pregnant, di&s;burdens them of their load, and nur&s;es them till they be again fit for bu&s;ine&s;s: another ho&s;pital cures them of the ve|nereal di&s;ea&s;e: and a third receives them with open arms, when, in&s;tead of de&s;ire, they become objects of aver&s;ion. Would not one imagine, that the&s;e ho&s;pitals have been erected for encouraging pro&s;titution? They undoubtedly have that effect, tho' far from being intended. Mr Stirling, &s;uper|intendant of the Edinburgh poor-hou&s;e, de&s;erves to be kept in perpetual remembrance, for a &s;cheme he contrived to reform common pro&s;ti|tutes. A number of them were confined in a hou&s;e of correction, on a daily allowance of three pence; and even part of that &s;mall pittance was embezzled by the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e. Pin|ching hunger did not reform their manners; for
<PB N="53" REF="57">
being &s;o ab&s;olutely idle, they encouraged each o|ther in vice, waiting impatiently for the hour of deliverance. Mr Stirling, with con&s;ent of the magi&s;trates, removed them to a clean hou&s;e; and in&s;tead of money, which is apt to be &s;quandered, appointed for each a pound of oat meal daily, with &s;alt, water, and fire for cooking. Relieved now from di&s;tre&s;s, they long for comfort: what would they not give for milk or ale? Work, &s;ays he, will procure you plenty. To &s;ome who of|fered to &s;pin, he gave flax and wheels, engaging to pay them half the price of their yarn, retain|ing the other half for the materials furni&s;hed: The &s;pinners earned about nine pence weekly, a comfortable addition to what they had before. The re&s;t undertook to &s;pin, one after another; and before the end of the fir&s;t quarter, they were all of them intent upon work. It was a branch of his plan, to &s;et free &s;uch as merited that fa|vour; and &s;ome of them appeared &s;o thoroughly reformed, as to be in no danger of a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>The ingenious author of <HI>The Police of France,</HI> who wrote in the year 1753, ob&s;erves, that not|with&s;tanding the plentiful provi&s;ion for the poor in that kingdom, mentioned above, there was a general complaint, of the increa&s;e of beggars and vagrants; and adds, that the French political writers, di&s;&s;atisfied with their own plan, had pre|&s;ented &s;everal memorials to the mini&s;try, pro|po&s;ing to adopt the Engli&s;h parochial a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, as greatly preferable. This is a curious fact; for at the very &s;ame time people in London, no le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with the&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, were wri|ting pamphlets in prai&s;e of the French ho&s;pitals. One thing is certain, that no plan hitherto inven|ted has given &s;atisfaction. Whether an unexcep|tionable plan is at all po&s;&s;ible, &s;eems extremely doubtful.</P>

In every plan for the poor that I have &s;een, workhou&s;es make one article; to provide work for tho&s;e who are willing, and to make tho&s;e work who are unwilling. With re&s;pect to the former, men need never be idle in England for want of employment; and they always &s;ucceed the be&s;t at the employment they chu&s;e for them&s;elves. With re&s;pect to the latter, puni&s;hment will not compel a man to labour &s;eriou&s;ly: he may a&s;&s;ume the appearance, but will make no progre&s;s; and the pretext of &s;ickne&s;s or weakne&s;s is ever at hand for an excu&s;e. The only compul&s;ion to make a man work &s;eriou&s;ly, is fear of want.</P>
<P>A ho&s;pital for the &s;ick, for the wounded, and for the maimed, is an excellent e&s;tabli&s;hment; being productive of good, without doing any harm. Such a ho&s;pital &s;hould depend partly on voluntary charity; to procure which a general conviction of its being well managed, is nece&s;&s;a|ry. Ho&s;pitals that have a &s;ufficient fund of their own, and that have no dependence on the good will of others, are commonly ill managed.</P>
<P>Lies there any objection again&s;t a workhou&s;e, for training to labour de&s;titute orphans, and beg|ging children? It is an article in Mr. Hay's plan, that the workhou&s;e &s;hould relieve poor families of all their children above three. This has an enticing appearance, but is un&s;ound at bottom. Children require the tenderne&s;s of a mother, du|ring the period of infantine di&s;ea&s;es; and even af|ter that period, they are far from being &s;afe in the hands of mercenaries, who &s;tudy nothing but their own ea&s;e and intere&s;t. Would it not be better, to di&s;tribute &s;mall &s;ums from time to time among poor families overburdened with children, &s;o as to relieve them from famine, not from la|bour? And with re&s;pect to orphans and begging
<PB N="55" REF="59">
children, I incline to think, that it would be a more &s;alutary mea&s;ure, to encourage mechanicks, manufactures, and farmers above all, to edu|cate &s;uch children. A premium for each, the half in hand, and the other half when they can work for them&s;elves, would be a proper encou|ragement. The be&s;t-regulated orphans-ho&s;pital I am acquainted with, is that of Edinburgh. Or|phans are taken in from every corner, provided only they be not under the age of &s;even, nor above that of twelve: under &s;even, they are too tender for a ho&s;pital; above twelve, their relations can find employment for them. Be&s;ide the being taught to read and write, they are carefully in|&s;tructed in &s;ome art, that may afford them com|fortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>No man ever called in que&s;tion the utility of the marine &s;ociety; which will reflect honour on the members as long as we have a navy to protect us: they de&s;erve a rank above that of gartered knights. That in&s;titution is the noble&s;t exertion of charity and patrioti&s;m, that ever was known in any country.</P>
<P>A &s;ort of ho&s;pital for &s;ervants who for twenty years have faithfully adhered to the &s;ame ma&s;ter, would be much to my ta&s;te; with a few adjoin|ing acres for a kitchen-garden. The fund for purcha&s;ing, building, and maintenance, mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by contribution; and none but the contri|butors &s;hould be entitled to offer &s;ervants to the hou&s;e. By &s;uch encouragement, a malady would be remedied, that of wandering from ma&s;ter to ma&s;ter for better wages, or ea&s;ier &s;ervice, which &s;eldom fails to corrupt &s;ervants. They ought to be comfortably provided for, adding to the allow|ance of the hou&s;e what pot-herbs are rai&s;ed by their own labour. A number of virtuous men thus a&s;&s;ociated, would end their days in com|fort;
<PB N="56" REF="60">
and the pro&s;pect of attaining a &s;ettlement &s;o agreeable, would form excellent &s;ervants. How advantageous would &s;uch a ho&s;pital prove to hu&s;|bandry in particular!</P>
<P>Of all the mi&s;chiefs that have been engendered by over-anxiety about the poor, none have prov|ed more fatal than foundling-ho&s;pitals. They tend to cool affection for children, &s;till more ef|fectually than the Engli&s;h pari&s;h-charity. At every occa&s;ional pinch for food, away goes a child to the ho&s;pital; and parental affection among the lower &s;ort turns &s;o languid, that many who are in no pinch, relieve them&s;elves of trouble by the &s;ame means. It is affirmed, that of the chil|dren born annually in Paris, about a third part are &s;ent to the foundling-ho&s;pital. The Paris almanack for the year 1768, mentions, that there were baptized 18,576 infants, of whom the foundling-ho&s;pital received 6025. The propor|tion originally was much le&s;s; but vice creeps on with a &s;wift pace. How enormous mu&s;t be the degeneracy of the Pari&s;ian populace, and their want of parental affection!</P>
<P>Let us next turn to infants &s;hut up in this ho&s;|pital. Of all animals, infants of the human race are the weake&s;t: they require a mother's affecti|on to guard them again&s;t numberle&s;s di&s;ea&s;es and accidents; a wi&s;e appointment of Providence to connect parents and children in the &s;tricte&s;t union. In a foundling-ho&s;pital, there is no fond mother to watch over her tender babe; and the hireling nur&s;e has no fondne&s;s but for her own little profit. Need we any other cau&s;e for the de&s;truction of in|fants in a foundling-ho&s;pital, much greater in proportion than of tho&s;e under the care of a mo|ther? And yet there is another cau&s;e equally po|tent, which is corrupted air. What Hanway ob&s;erves upon pari&s;h-workhou&s;es, is equally ap|plicable

An infant expo&s;ed at the door of a dwelling-hou&s;e, mu&s;t be taken up: but in that ca&s;e, which &s;el|dom happens, the infant has a better chance for life with a hired nur&s;e than in a ho&s;pital; and a chance perhaps little wor&s;e, bad as it is, than with an unnatural mother. I approve not indeed of a quarterly payment to &s;uch a nur&s;e: would it not do better to furni&s;h her bare maintenance for three years; and if the child be alive at that time, to give her a hand&s;ome addition?</P>
<P>A hou&s;e of correction is nece&s;&s;ary for good or|der; but belongs not to the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, which concerns maintenance of the poor, not puni&s;h|ment of vagrants. I &s;hall only by the way bor|row a thought from Fielding, that fa&s;ting is the proper puni&s;hment of profligacy, not any puni&s;h|ment that is attended with &s;hame. Puni&s;hment, he ob&s;erves, that deprives a man of all &s;en&s;e of honour, never will contribute to make him vir|tuous.</P>
<P>Charity-&s;chools might have been proper, when few could read, and fewer write; but the&s;e arts are now &s;o common, that in mo&s;t fami|lies children may be taught to read at home, and to write in a private &s;chool at little expence. Cha|rity-&s;chools at pre&s;ent are more hurtful than be|neficial: young per&s;ons who continue there &s;o long as to read and write fluently, become too delicate for hard labour, and too proud for ordi|nary

labour. Knowledge is a dangerous acqui&s;i|tion to the labouring poor: the more of it that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a &s;hepherd, a ploughman, or any drudge, the le&s;s fitted is he to labour with content. The only plau&s;ible argument for a charity-&s;chool, is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That children of the labouring poor are taught there the principles of religion and of morality, which they cannot acquire at home."</Q> The argument would be invincible, if with|out education we could have no knowledge of the&s;e principles. But Providence has not left man in a &s;tate &s;o imperfect: the principles of theology and of morality are &s;tamped on his heart; and none can be ignorant of them, who attend to their own perceptions. Education is indeed of u&s;e to ripen &s;uch perceptions; and it is a &s;ingular u&s;e to tho&s;e who have time for reading and thinking: but education in a charity-&s;chool is &s;o &s;light, as to render it doubtful, whether it be not more hurtful by fo&s;tering lazine&s;s, than advantageous by conveying in&s;truction. The natural impre&s;&s;i|ons of religion and morality, if not ob&s;cured by vicious habits, are &s;ufficient for good conduct: pre&s;erve a man from vice by con&s;tant labour, and he will not be deficient in his duty either to God or to man. He&s;iod, an ancient and re&s;pectable poet, &s;ays, that God hath placed labour as a guard to virtue. More integrity accordingly will be found among a number of indu&s;trious poor ta|ken at random, than among the &s;ame number in any other cla&s;s.</P>
<P>I heartily approve every regulation that tends to prevent idlene&s;s. Chief Ju&s;tice Hale &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That prevention of poverty and idlene&s;s would do more good than all the gibbets, whipping|po&s;ts, and goals in the kingdom."</Q> In that view, gaming-hou&s;es ought to be heavily taxed, as well as hor&s;e-racing, cock-fighting, and all
<PB N="59" REF="63">
meetings that encourage idlene&s;s. The admitting low people to vote for members of parliament, is a &s;ource of idlene&s;s, corruption, and poverty. The &s;ame privilege is ruinous to every &s;mall parliament borough. Nor have I any difficulty to pronounce, that the admitting the populace to vote in the election of a mini&s;ter, a frequent practice in Scotland, is productive of the &s;ame pernicious effects.</P>
<P>What then is to be the re&s;ult of the forego|ing enquiry? Is it from defect of invention that a good legal e&s;tabli&s;hment for the poor is not yet di&s;covered? or is it impracticable to make any legal e&s;tabli&s;hment that is not fraught with corruption? I incline to the latter, for the follow|ing rea&s;ons, no le&s;s obvious than &s;olid, That in a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment for the poor, no di&s;tinction can be made between virtue and vice; and con|&s;equently that every &s;uche&s;t abli&s;hment mu&s;t be a premium for idlene&s;s. And where is the nece&s;&s;i|ty, after all, of any public e&s;tabli&s;hment? By what unhappy prejudice have people been led to think, that the Author of our nature, &s;o benefi|cent to his favourite man in every other re&s;pect, has abandoned the indigent to famine and death, if municipal law interpo&s;e not? We need but in|&s;pect the human heart to be convinced, that per|&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s are his peculiar care. Not only has he made it our duty to afford them relief, but has &s;uperadded the pa&s;&s;ion of pity to enforce the performance of that duty. This branch of our nature fulfils in perfection all the &s;alutary purpo&s;es of charity, without admitting any one of the deplorable evils that a legal provi&s;ion is fraught with. The contrivance, at the &s;ame time, is extremely &s;imple: it leaves to every man the objects as well as mea&s;ure of his charity. No man e&s;teems it a duty to relieve wretches reduced
<PB N="60" REF="64">
to poverty by idlene&s;s and profligacy: they move not our pity; nor do they expect any good from us. Wi&s;ely therefore is it ordered by Provi|dence, that charity &s;hould in every re&s;pect be vo|luntary, to prevent the idle and profligate from depending on it for &s;upport.</P>
<P>This plan is in many re&s;pects excellent. The exerci&s;e of charity, when free from compul&s;ion, is extremely plea&s;ant. The plea&s;ure, it is true, is &s;carce felt where charity is rendered unnece&s;&s;a|ry by municipal law; but were that law laid a&s;ide, the gratification of pity would become one of our &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures. Charity, like other affecti|ons, is invigorated by exerci&s;e, and no le&s;s en|feebled by di&s;u&s;e. Providence withal hath &s;cat|tered benevolence among the &s;ons of men with a liberal hand: and notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;truction of municipal law, &s;eldom is there found one &s;o obdurate, as to re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion, when a proper object is pre&s;ented. In a well re|gulated government, promoting indu&s;try and vir|tue, the per&s;ons who need charity are not many: and &s;uch per&s;ons may, with a&s;&s;urance, depend on the charity of their neighbours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Italians are not more remarkable for a charita|ble di&s;po&s;ition, than their neighbours. No fewer how|ever than &s;eventy thou&s;and mendicant friars live there upon voluntary charity; and I have not heard that any one of them ever died of want.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may, at the &s;ame time, be boldly affirmed, that tho&s;e who need charity, would be more com|fortably provided for by the plan of Providence, than by any legal e&s;tabli&s;hment. Creatures, loath&s;ome by di&s;ea&s;e or na&s;tine&s;s, affect the air in a poor-hou&s;e, and have little chance for life, without more care and kindline&s;s, than can be hoped from &s;ervants, render callous by continual &s;cenes of mi&s;ery. Con&s;ider, on the other hand,
<PB N="61" REF="65">
the con&s;equences of voluntary charity, equally agreeable to the giver and receiver. The kind|ly connection it forms between them, grows &s;tronger and &s;tronger by reiteration; and &s;qual|lid poverty, far from being an ob&s;truction, ex|cites a degree of pity, proportioned to the di|&s;tre&s;s. It may happen for a wonder, that an indigent per&s;on is overlooked; but for one who will &s;uffer by &s;uch neglect, multitudes &s;uffer by compelled charity.</P>
<P>But what I in&s;i&s;t on with peculiar &s;atisfaction is, that natural charity is an illu&s;trious &s;upport to virtue. Indigent virtue can never fail of re|lief, becau&s;e it never fails to enflame compa&s;&s;ion. Indigent vice, on the contrary, rai&s;es indignation more than pity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 2. part 7.</NOTE>; and therefore can have lit|tle pro&s;pect of relief. What a glorious incite|ment to indu&s;try and virtue, and how di&s;cou|raging to idlene&s;s and vice! Lamentable it is, that &s;o beautiful a &s;tructure &s;hould be razed to the ground by municipal law, which, in provi|ding for the poor, makes no di&s;tinction between virtue and vice. The execution of the poor|laws would indeed be impracticable, were &s;uch a di&s;tinction attempted by enquiring into the conduct and character of every <HI>pauper.</HI> Where are judges to be found who will patiently follow out &s;uch a dark and intricate expi&s;cation? To accompli&s;h the ta&s;k, a man mu&s;t abandon every other concern.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;tatutes mentioned above, the legi&s;lature appear carefully to have avoided compul&s;ory charity: every mea&s;ure for promo|ting voluntary charity was fir&s;t tried, before the fatal blow was &s;truck, empowering pari&s;h-offi|cers
<PB N="62" REF="66">
to impo&s;e a tax for the poor. The legi&s;la|ture certainly did not fore&s;ee the baneful con&s;e|quences: but how came they not to &s;ee that they were di&s;tru&s;ting Providence, declaring in effect, that the plan e&s;tabli&s;hed by our Maker for the poor, is in&s;ufficient? Many are the mu|nicipal laws that enforce the laws of nature, by additional rewards and puni&s;hments; but it was &s;ingularly bold to aboli&s;h the natural law of cha|rity, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a legal tax in its &s;tead. Men will always be mending: what a confu&s;ed jumble do they make, when they attempt to mend the laws of Nature! Leave Nature to her own operations: &s;he under&s;tands them the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Few regulations are more plau&s;ible than what are political; and yet few are more deceitful. An ingenious writer makes the following ob&s;er|vations upon the 43^o Eliz. e&s;tabli&s;hing a mainte|nance for the poor. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Laws have been enacted in many other countries, which have puni&s;h|ed the idle beggar, and exhorted the rich to extend their charity to the poor: but it is peculiar to the humanity of England, to have made their &s;upport a matter of obligation and nece&s;&s;ity on the more wealthy. The Engli&s;h &s;eem to be the fir&s;t nation in Europe in &s;cience, arts, and arms: they likewi&s;e are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the free&s;t and mo&s;t perfect of con&s;titutions, and the ble&s;&s;ings con&s;equential to that freedom. If virtues in an individual are &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ed to be rewarded in this world, I do not think it too pre&s;umptuous to &s;uppo&s;e, that national virtues may likewi&s;e meet with their reward. England hath, to its peculiar honour, not only made their poor free, but hath provided a certain and &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hment to prevent their nece&s;&s;ities and indigence, when they ari&s;e from what the law
<PB N="63" REF="67">
calls <HI>the act of God:</HI> and are not the&s;e benefi|cent and humane attentions to the mi&s;eries of our fellow-creatures, the fir&s;t of tho&s;e poor pleas which we are capable of offering, in behalf of our imperfections, to an all-wi&s;e and merciful Creator!"</Q> To this writer, who &s;hows more zeal than knowledge, I oppo&s;e ano|ther, who&s;e reflections are more rational. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In England, there is an act of the legi&s;lature, obliging every pari&s;h to maintain its own poor. Scarce any man living, who has not &s;een the effects of this law, but mu&s;t approve of it; and yet &s;uch are its effects, that the &s;treets of London are filled with objects of mi&s;ery be|yond what is &s;een in any other city. The la|bouring poor, depending on this law to be provided in &s;ickne&s;s and old age, are little &s;o|licitous to &s;ave, and become habitually pro|fu&s;e. The principle of charity is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Providence in the human heart, for reliev|ing tho&s;e who are di&s;abled to work for them|&s;elves. And if the labouring poor had no de|pendence but on the principle of charity, they would be more religious; and if they were influenced by religion, they would be le&s;s abandoned in their behaviour. Thus this &s;eeming-good act turns to a national evil: there is more di&s;tre&s;s among the poor in Lon|don than any where in Europe; and more drunkenne&s;s both in males and females<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Author of Angeloni's letters.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I am aware, that during the reign of Elizabeth, &s;ome compul&s;ion might be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the poor from &s;tarving. Henry VIII. had &s;eque|&s;tered all the ho&s;pitals, a hundred and ten in number, and &s;quandered their revenues; he had
<PB N="64" REF="68">
al&s;o demoli&s;hed all the abbeys. By the&s;e means, the poor were reduced to a mi&s;erable condition: e&s;pecially as private charity, for want of exer|ci&s;e, was at a low ebb. That critical juncture required indeed help from the legi&s;lature; and a temporary provi&s;ion for the poor would have been a proper mea&s;ure; &s;o contrived as not to &s;uper&s;ede voluntary charity, but rather to pro|mote it. Unlucky it is for England, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure was overlooked; but Queen Elizabeth and her parliaments had not the talent of fore&s;ee|ing con&s;equences without the aid of experience. A perpetual tax for the poor was impo&s;ed, the mo&s;t pernicious tax that ever was impo&s;ed in any country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent times, the rea&s;on now given pleads again&s;t aboli&s;hing at once a le|gal provi&s;ion for the poor. It may be taken for granted, that charity is in England not more vi|gorous at pre&s;ent, than it was in the days of Eli|zabeth. Would our mini&s;try but lead the way, by &s;howing &s;ome zeal for a reformation, expe|dients would probably be invented, for &s;upport|ing the poor, without unhinging voluntary cha|rity. The following expedient, is propo&s;ed, merely as a &s;pecimen. Let a tax be impo&s;ed by parliament on every pari&s;h for their poor, varia|ble in proportion to the number; but not to ex|ceed the half of what is nece&s;&s;ary; and directing the landholders to make up quarterly, a li&s;t of the names and condition of &s;uch per&s;ons as in their opinion need charity; with an e&s;timate of what each ought to have weekly. The public tax makes the half, and the other half is to be rai&s;ed by voluntary contribution. To prevent collu&s;ion, the roll of the poor, and their weekly appointment, with a &s;ub&s;cription of gentlemen for their part of the &s;um, &s;hall be examined by
<PB N="65" REF="69">
the ju&s;tices of peace at a quarterly meeting; who, on receiving &s;atisfaction, mu&s;t order the &s;um ari|&s;ing from the public tax to be di&s;tributed among the poor contained in the roll, according to the e&s;timate of the landholders. As the public fund lies dead till the &s;ub&s;cription is completed, it is not to be imagined, that any gentleman will &s;tand out: it would be a public imputation on his character. Far from apprehending any deficien|cy, confident I am, that every gentleman would con&s;ider it as honourable to contribute largely. This agreeable work mu&s;t be blended with what is rather di&s;agreeable, that of excluding from the roll every profligate, male or female. If that rule be followed out with a proper degree of &s;everity, the innocent poor will dimini&s;h daily; &s;o as in time to be &s;afely left upon voluntary charity, without nece&s;&s;ity of any tax.</P>
<P>But mu&s;t mi&s;erable wretches, reduced to po|verty by idlene&s;s or intemperance, be, in a Chri&s;ti|an country, abandoned to di&s;ea&s;es and famine? It is this very argument, &s;hallow as it is, that has corrupted the indu&s;try of England, and reduced multitudes to di&s;ea&s;es and famine. Tho&s;e who are able to work, may be locked up in a hou&s;e of correction, to be fed with bread and water; but with liberty of working for them&s;elves. And as for the remainder, their ca&s;e is not de&s;perate, when they have acce&s;s to &s;uch tender-hearted per&s;ons as are more eminent for pity than for prin|ciple. If by neglect or over&s;ight any happen to die of want, the example will tend more to re|formation, than the mo&s;t pathetic di&s;cour&s;e from the pulpit.</P>
<P>Even at the hazard of lo&s;ing a few lives by neglect or over&s;ight, common begging ought ab|&s;olutely to be prohibited. The mo&s;t profligate are the mo&s;t impudent, and the mo&s;t expert at
<PB N="66" REF="70">
feigning di&s;tre&s;s. If begging be indulged to any, all will ru&s;h into the public: idlers are fond of that wandering and indolent &s;ort of life; and there is no temptation to idlene&s;s more &s;ucce&s;sful, than liberty to beg. In order to be relieved from common beggars, it has been propo&s;ed, to fine tho&s;e who gave them alms. Little penetration mu&s;t they have, to whom the in&s;ufficiency of &s;uch a remedy is not palpable. It is ea&s;y to give alms without been &s;een; and compa&s;&s;ion will ex|tort alms, even at the hazard of &s;uffering for it; not to mention, that every one in &s;uch a ca&s;e will avoid the odious character of an informer. The following remedy is &s;ugge&s;ted, as what probably may an&s;wer better. An officer mu&s;t be appoint|ed in every pari&s;h, with a competent &s;alary, for apprehending and carrying to the workhou&s;e every &s;trolling beggar; under the penalty of lo&s;ing his office, with what &s;alary is due to him, if any beggar be found &s;trolling four and twenty hours after the fact comes to his knowledge. In the workhou&s;e &s;uch beggars &s;hall be fed with bread and water for a year, but with liberty of working for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I declare re&s;olutely again&s;t a perpetual tax for the poor. But if there mu&s;t be &s;uch a tax, I know of none le&s;s &s;ubver&s;ive of indu&s;try and mo|rals, than that e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland, obliging the landholders in every pari&s;h to meet at &s;tated times, in order to provide a fund for the poor; but leaving the objects of their charity, and the mea&s;ure, to their own humanity and di&s;cretion. In this plan, there is no encroachment on the natural duty of charity, but only that the mi|nority mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the opinion of the majo|rity.</P>

in country-pari&s;hes, the following variation is propo&s;ed. In&s;tead of landholders, who are pro|per in country-pari&s;hes, let there be in each town-pari&s;h a &s;tanding committee, to be cho&s;en by the proprietors of hou&s;es, the third part to be chang|ed annually. This committee, with the mini&s;ter, make up a li&s;t of &s;uch as de&s;erve charity, adding an e&s;timate of what, with their own labour, may be &s;ufficient for each of them. The mini&s;ter, with one or two of the committee, carry about this li&s;t to every family that can afford charity, &s;ugge&s;ting what may be proper for each to contri|bute. This li&s;t, with an addition of the &s;um contributed or promi&s;ed by each hou&s;eholder, mu&s;t be affixed on the principal door of the pari&s;h|church, to honour the contributors, and to inform the poor of the provi&s;ion made for them. Some &s;uch mode may probably be effectual, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds of voluntary charity. But if any one ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to contribute after &s;everal applications, the committee at their di&s;cretion may tax him. If it be the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who declines contributing, the tax mu&s;t be laid upon him, re&s;erving relief again&s;t his land|lord.</P>
<P>In great towns, the poor, who ought to be pro|hibited from begging, are le&s;s known than in country pari&s;hes. And among a crowd of inha|bitants, it is ea&s;ier for an individual to e&s;cape the eye of the public, when he with-holds charity, than in country-pari&s;hes. Both defects will be remedied by the plan above propo&s;ed: it will bring to light, in great cities, the poor who de|&s;erve charity; and it will bring to light every per&s;on who with-holds charity.</P>

<HEAD>A GREAT CITY con&s;idered in Phy&s;ical, Moral, and Political Views.</HEAD>
<P>IN all ages an opinion &s;eems to have been pre|valent, that a great city is a great evil, and that a capital may be too great for the &s;tate, as a head may be for the body. Con&s;idering however the very &s;hallow rea&s;ons that have been given for this opinion, it &s;hould &s;eem to be but &s;lightly founded. There are &s;everal ordinances limiting the extent of Paris, and prohibiting new buildings beyond the pre&s;cribed bounds; the fir&s;t of which is by Henry II. ann. 1549. The&s;e ordinances have been renewed from time to time, down to the year 1672, in which year there is an edict of Louis XIV. to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fir&s;t, That by enlarging the city, the air would be rendered unwhole&s;ome. Second, That cleaning the &s;treets would prove a great additional labour. Third, That adding to the number of inhabitants would rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions, of labour, and of manu|factures. Fourth, That ground would be
<PB N="69" REF="73">
covered with buildings in&s;tead of corn, which might hazard a &s;carcity. Fifth, That the country would be depopulated by the de&s;ire that people have to re&s;ort to the capital. And, la&s;tly, That the difficulty of governing &s;uch numbers would be an encouragement to robbery and murder."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons for confining the city of Paris within certain bounds are wonderfully &s;hallow. The mo&s;t important of them conclude ju&s;tly again&s;t permitting an increa&s;e of inhabitants: the &s;econd and fourth conclude only again&s;t enlarging the city; and the&s;e, at the be&s;t, are trifling. The fir&s;t rea&s;on urged again&s;t enlarging the city, is a &s;olid rea&s;on for enlarging it, &s;uppo&s;ing the num|bers to be limited; for to prevent crouding is an excellent preventive of unwhole&s;ome air. Paris, with the &s;ame number of inhabitants that were in the days of the fourth Henry, occupies thrice the &s;pace, much to the health as well as comfort of the inhabitants. Had the ordinances mentioned been made effectual, the hou&s;es in Paris mu&s;t all have been built, like tho&s;e in the old town, &s;tory above &s;tory, a&s;cending to the &s;ky like the tower of Babel. Before the great fire <HI>anno</HI> 1666, the plague was frequent in London; but by widening the &s;treets, and enlarging the hou&s;es, there has not &s;ince been known in that great city, any contagious di&s;temper that de&s;erves the name of a plague. The third, fifth, and la&s;t rea&s;ons, conclude again&s;t permitting any addition to the number of inhabitants; but conclude nothing again&s;t enlarging the town. In a word, the mea|&s;ure adopted in the&s;e ordinances has little or no tendency to correct the evils complained of; and infallibly would enflame the chief of them. The
<PB N="70" REF="74">
mea&s;ure that ought to have been adopted, is to limit the number of inhabitants, not the extent of the town.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth of England, copying the French ordinances, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation <HI>anno</HI> 1602, prohibiting any new buildings within three miles of London. The preamble is in the fol|lowing words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That fore&s;eeing the great and manifold inconveniencies and mi&s;chiefs which daily grow, and are likely to increa&s;e, in the city and &s;uburbs of London, by confluence of people to inhabit the &s;ame; not only by rea&s;on that &s;uch multitudes can hardly be governed to &s;erve God, and obey her Maje&s;ty, without con&s;tituting an addition of new officers, and enlarging their authority; but al&s;o can hardly be provided of food and other nece&s;&s;aries at a rea&s;onable price; and finally, that as &s;uch multitudes of people, many of them poor, who mu&s;t live by begging, or wor&s;e means, are heaped up together, and in a &s;ort &s;mo|thered, with many children and &s;ervants, in one hou&s;e or &s;mall tenement; it mu&s;t needs follow, if any plague or other univer&s;al &s;ickne&s;s come among&s;t them, that it would pre&s;ently &s;pread through the whole city and confines, and al&s;o into all parts of the realm."</Q></P>
<P>There appears no deeper penetration in this pro|clamation, than in the French ordinances. The &s;ame error is ob&s;ervable in both, which is the li|miting the extent of the town, in&s;tead of limiting the number of inhabitants. True it is indeed, that the regulation would have a better effect in London than in Paris. As &s;tone is in plenty about Paris, hou&s;es there may be carried to a very great height; and are actually &s;o carried in the old town: but there being no &s;tone about
<PB N="71" REF="75">
London, the hou&s;es formerly were built of timber, now of brick; materials too frail for a lofty edifice.</P>
<P>Proceeding to particulars, the fir&s;t objection, which is the expence of governing a great multi|tude, concludes again&s;t the numbers, not again&s;t the extent of the city. At the &s;ame time, the objection is at be&s;t doubtful in point of fact. Though vices abound in a great city, requiring the &s;tricte&s;t attention of the magi&s;trate; yet with a well-regulated police, it is much le&s;s expen&s;ive to govern 600,000 in one city, than the &s;ame number in ten different cities. The &s;econd ob|jection, viz. the high price of provi&s;ions, &s;trikes only again&s;t numbers, not extent. Be&s;ide, what|ever might have been the ca&s;e in the days of Elizabeth, when agriculture and internal com|merce were in their infancy; there are at pre&s;ent not many towns in England, where a temperate man may live cheaper than in London. The hazard of contagious di&s;tempers, which is the third objection, is an invincible argument again&s;t limiting the extent of a great town. It is men|tioned above, that from the year 1666, when the &s;treets were widened, and the hou&s;es enlarged, London has never been once vi&s;ited by the plague. If the proclamation had taken effect, the hou&s;es mu&s;t have been &s;o crouded upon each other, and the &s;treets &s;o contracted, as to have occa&s;ioned plagues &s;till more frequently than before the year 1666.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try of the Queen's immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors were not more clear-&s;ighted than &s;he and her mini&s;ters were. In the year 1624, King James i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t building in London upon new foundations. Charles I. i&s;|&s;ued two proclamations to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; one in the year 1625, and one in the year 1630.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="76">
The progre&s;s of political knowledge has un|folded many bad effects of a great city, more weighty than any urged in the&s;e proclamations. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is, that people born and bred in a great city are commonly weak and ef|feminate. Vegetius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De re militari, lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE> ob&s;erving, that men bred to hu&s;bandry make the be&s;t &s;oldiers, adds what follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Interdum tamen nece&s;&s;itas exigit, etiam urbanos ad arma compelli: qui ubi nomen dedere militiae, primum laborare, decurrere, portare pondus, et &s;olem pulveremque ferre, condi&s;cant; parco victu utantur et ru&s;tico; interdum &s;ub divo, interdum &s;ub papilionibus, commorentur. Tunc demum ad u&s;um erudi|antur armorum: et &s;i longior expeditio emer|git, in angariis plurimum detinendi &s;unt, pro|culque habendi a civitatis illecebris: ut eo modo, et corporibus eorum robur accedat, et animis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But &s;ometimes there is a nece&s;&s;ity for arming the towns-people, and calling them out to &s;ervice. When this is the ca&s;e, it ought to be the fir&s;t care, to enure them to labour, to march them up and down the country, to make them carry heavy bur|dens, and to harden them again&s;t the weather. Their food &s;hould be coar&s;e and &s;canty, and they &s;hould be habituated to &s;leep alternately in their tents, and in the open air. Then is the time to in&s;truct them in the exerci&s;e of their arms. If the expediti|on is a di&s;tant one, they &s;hould be chiefly employed in the &s;tations of po&s;ts or expre&s;&s;es, and removed as much as po&s;&s;ible from the dangerous allurements that abound in large cities; that thus they may be invigorated both in mind and body."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The luxury of a great city de&s;|cends from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, infecting all ranks of men; and there is little opportunity in it for &s;uch exerci&s;e as renders the body vigor|ous
<PB N="73" REF="77">
and robu&s;t. This is a phy&s;ical objection again&s;t a great city: the next regards morality. Virtue is exerted chiefly in re&s;traint: vice, in giving freedom to de&s;ire. Moderation and &s;elf|command form a character the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of virtue: &s;uperfluity of animal &s;pirits, and love of plea&s;ure, form a character the mo&s;t liable to vice. Low vices, pilfering for example, or ly|ing, draw few or no imitators; but vices that indicate a &s;oul above re&s;traint, fail not to pro|duce admirers. Where a man boldly &s;truggles again&s;t unlawful re&s;traint, he is ju&s;tly applauded and imitated; and the vulgar are not apt to di&s;|tingui&s;h nicely between lawful and unlawful re|&s;traint: the boldne&s;s is vi&s;ible, and they pierce no deeper. It is the unruly boy, full of animal &s;pirits, who at a public &s;chool is admired and imi|tated; not the virtuous and mode&s;t. Vices ac|cordingly that &s;how &s;pirit, are extremely infec|tious; virtue very little. Hence the corrupti|on of a great city, which increa&s;es more and more in proportion to the number of inhabitants. But it is &s;ufficient here barely to mention that objection; becau&s;e it has been much in&s;i&s;ted on in antecedent parts of this work.</P>
<P>The following bad effects are more of a poli|tical nature. A great town is a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to the free circulation of money. The current coin is accumulated in the capital: and di&s;tant provinces mu&s;t &s;ink into idlene&s;s; for without ready money neither arts nor manufactures can flouri&s;h. Thus we find le&s;s and le&s;s activity, in proportion commonly to the di&s;tance from the capital, and an ab&s;olute torpor in the extremities. It may be ob&s;erved be&s;ide, that as hor&s;es in a great city mu&s;t be provided with provender from a di&s;tance, the country is robbed of its dung for the benefit of the rich fields round the city. But
<PB N="74" REF="78">
as manure laid upon poor land is of more advan|tage to the farmer than upon what is already highly improved, the depriving di&s;tant parts of manure is a lo&s;s to the country in general. Nor is this all: The dung of an exten&s;ive city, the bulk of it at lea&s;t, is &s;o remote from the fields to which it mu&s;t be carried, that the expence of carriage &s;wallows up the profit.</P>
<P>Another bad effect of accumulating money in the capital is, to rai&s;e there the price of labour; and the temptation of high wages, making every one flock to the capital, robs the country of its be&s;t hands. And as they who re&s;ort to the ca|pital are commonly young people, who remove as &s;oon as they are fit for work, di&s;tant provin|ces are burdened with their maintenance, with|out reaping any benefit by their labour.</P>
<P>But of all, the mo&s;t deplorable effect of a great city, is the preventing of population, by &s;hortening the lives of its inhabitants. Does a capital &s;well in proportion to the numbers that are drained from the country? Far from it. The air of a populous city is infected by multitudes crouded together; and people there &s;eldom make out the u&s;ual time of life. With re&s;pect to London in particular, the fact is but too well a&s;certained. The burials in that immen&s;e city greatly exceed the births: the difference &s;ome affirm to be no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and yearly: by the mo&s;t moderate computation, not under &s;even or eight thou&s;and. As London is far from being on the decline, the con&s;umption of &s;o many inhabitants mu&s;t be &s;upplied from the country; and the annual &s;upply amounts pro|bably to a greater number than were needed an|nually for recruiting our armies and navies in the late war with France. If &s;o, London is a greater enemy to population, than a bloody war
<PB N="75" REF="79">
would be, &s;uppo&s;ing it even to be perpetual. What an enormous tax is Britain thus &s;ubjected to for &s;upporting her capital! The rearing and educating yearly for London 7 or 8000 per&s;ons, require an immen&s;e &s;um.</P>
<P>In Paris, if the bills of mortality can be relied on, the births and burials are nearly equal, be|ing each of them about 19,000 yearly; and ac|cording to that computation, Paris &s;hould need no recruits from the country. But in that city, the bills of mortality cannot be depended on for burials. It is there univer&s;ally the practice of high and low, to have their infants nur&s;ed in the country, till they be three years of age; and con&s;equently tho&s;e who die before that age, are not inli&s;ted. What proportion the&s;e bear to the whole is uncertain. But a gue&s;s may be made from &s;uch as die in London; which are comput|ed to be one half of the whole that die<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Price, p. 362.</NOTE>. Now giving the utmo&s;t allowance for the healthi|ne&s;s of the country above that of a town, Paris children that die in the country before the age of three, cannot be brought &s;o low as a third of tho&s;e that die. On the other hand, the London bills of mortality are le&s;s to be depended on for births than for burials. None are inli&s;ted but infants baptized by clergymen of the Engli&s;h church; and the numerous children of Papi&s;ts, Di&s;&s;enters, and other &s;ectaries, are left out of the account. Upon the whole, the difference between the births and burials in Paris and in London, is much le&s;s than it appears to be on comparing the bills of mortality of the&s;e two cities.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="80">
At the &s;ame time, giving full allowance for children that are not brought into the London bills of mortality, there is the highe&s;t probabili|ty that a greater number of children are born in Paris than in London; and con&s;equently that the former requires fewer recruits from the coun|try than the latter. In Paris, dome&s;tic &s;ervants are encouraged to marry: they are ob&s;erved to be more &s;ettled than when batchelors, and more attentive to their duty. In London, &s;uch mar|riages are di&s;couraged, as rendering a &s;ervant more attentive to his own family, than to that of his ma&s;ter. But a &s;ervant attentive to his own family, will not, for his own &s;ake, neglect that of his ma&s;ter. At any rate, is he not more to be depended on, than a &s;ervant who continues a batchelor? What can be expected of idle and pampered batchelors, but debauchery, and every &s;ort of corruption? Nothing re&s;trains them from ab&s;olute profligacy, but the eye of the ma&s;|ter, who for that rea&s;on is their aver&s;ion not their love. If the poor-laws be named the folio of corruption, batchelor-&s;ervants in London may well be con&s;idered as a large appendix. And this attracts the eye to the poor-laws, which indeed make the chief difference between Paris and London, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent point. In Paris, certain funds are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the poor, the yearly produce of which admits but a limit|ed number. As that fund is always pre-occu|pied, the low people who are not on the li&s;t, have little or no pro&s;pect of bread, but from their own indu&s;try; and to the indu&s;trious, mar|riage is in a great mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. In Lon|don, a pari&s;h is taxed in proportion to the num|ber of its poor; and every per&s;on who is plea&s;ed to be idle, is entitled to maintenance. Mo&s;t things thrive by encouragement, and idlene&s;s
<PB N="77" REF="81">
above all. Certainty of maintenance, renders the low people in England idle and profligate; e&s;pecially in London, where luxury prevails, and infects every rank. So in&s;olent are the London poor, that &s;carce one of them will conde&s;cend to eat brown bread. There are accordingly in Lon|don, a much greater number of idle and profli|gate wretches, than in Paris, or in any other town in proportion to the number of inhabitants. The&s;e wretches, in Doctor Swift's &s;tyle, never think of po&s;terity, becau&s;e po&s;terity never thinks of them: men who hunt after plea&s;ure, and live from day to day, have no notion of being bur|dened with a family. The&s;e cau&s;es produce a greater number of children in Paris than in Lon|don; though probably they differ not much in populou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add but one other objection to a great city, which is not &s;light. An overgrown capi|tal, far above a rival, has, by numbers and riches, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing influence in public affairs. The populace are ductile, and ea&s;ily mi&s;led by ambitious and de&s;igning magi&s;trates. Nor are there wanting critical times, in which &s;uch ma|gi&s;trates, acquiring artificial influence, may have power to di&s;turb the public peace. That an overgrown capital may prove dangerous to &s;ove|reignty, has more than once been experienced both in Paris and London.</P>
<P>It would give one the &s;pleen, to hear the French and Engli&s;h zealou&s;ly di&s;puting about the extent of their capitals, as if the pro&s;perity of their country depended on that circum&s;tance. To me it appears like one glorying in the king's-evil, or in any contagious di&s;temper. Much bet|ter employed would they be, in contriving means for le&s;&s;ening tho&s;e cities. There is not a politi|cal mea&s;ure, that, in my opinion, would tend
<PB N="78" REF="82">
more to aggrandize the kingdom of France, or of Britain, than to &s;plit its capital into &s;everal great towns. My plan would be, to confine the inhabitants of London to 100,000, compo&s;ed of the king and his hou&s;ehold, &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice, government-boards, prime nobility and gentry, with nece&s;&s;ary &s;hop-keepers, arti&s;ts, and other dependents. Let the re&s;t of the inhabitants be di&s;tributed into nine towns properly &s;ituated, &s;ome for internal commerce, &s;ome for foreign. Such a plan would diffu&s;e life and vigour through every corner of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>To execute &s;uch a plan, would, I acknow|ledge, require the deepe&s;t political &s;kill, and much per&s;everance. I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t what occurs at pre&s;ent. The fir&s;t &s;tep mu&s;t be, to mark proper &s;pots for the nine towns, the mo&s;t advan|tageous for trade, or for manufactures. If any of the&s;e &s;pots be occupied already with &s;mall towns, &s;o much the better. The next &s;tep is a capitation-tax on the inhabitants of London; the &s;um levied to be appropriated for encouraging the new towns. One encouragement would have a good effect; which is, a premium to every man who builds in any of the&s;e towns, more or le&s;s, in proportion to the &s;ize of the hou&s;e. This tax would bani&s;h from London, every manufacture but of the mo&s;t lucrative kind. When, by this means, the inhabitants of London are reduced to a number not much above 100,000, the near pro&s;pect of being relieved from the tax, will make every hou&s;eholder active to bani&s;h all above that number: and to prevent a renewal of the tax, a greater number will never again be per|mitted. It would require great penetration to proportion the &s;ums to be levied and di&s;tributed, &s;o as to have their proper effect, without over|burdening
<PB N="79" REF="83">
the capital on the one hand, or giving too great encouragement for building on the other, which might tempt people to build for the premium merely, without any further view. Much will depend on an advantageous &s;ituation: hou&s;es built there will always find inhabitants.</P>
<P>The two great cities of London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter are extremely ill fitted for local union. The latter, the &s;eat of government and of the noble&s;&s;e, infects the former with luxury and with love of &s;how. The former, the &s;eat of commerce, infects the latter with love of gain. The mixture of the&s;e oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions, is productive of every groveling vice.</P>

<HEAD>Origin and Progre&s;s of AMERICAN NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING no authentic materials for a natural hi&s;tory of all the Americans, the following ob&s;ervations &s;hall be confined to a few tribes, the be&s;t known; and to the kingdoms of Peru and Mexico, as they were at the date of the Spani&s;h conque&s;t.</P>
<P>As there appears no pa&s;&s;age by land to America from the old world, no problem has more embar|ra&s;&s;ed the learned, than to give an account from whence the Americans &s;prang: there are as many different opinions, as there are writers. Many attempts have been made for di&s;covering a pa&s;&s;age by land; but hitherto in vain. Kam&s;katka, it is true, is divided from America by a narrow &s;trait, full of i&s;lands: and M. Buffon, to render the pa&s;&s;age &s;till more ea&s;y than by &s;ea, conjectures, that thereabout there may formerly have been a land-pa&s;&s;age, though now wa&s;hed away by vio|lence of the ocean. There is indeed great ap|pearance of truth in this conjecture; as all the
<PB N="81" REF="85">
quadrupeds of the north of A&s;ia &s;eem to have made their way to America; the bear, for ex|ample, the roe, the deer, the rain-deer, the beaver, the wolf, the fox, the hare, the rat, the mole. He admits that in America there is not to be &s;een a lion, a tiger, a panther, or any other A&s;iatic quadruped of a hot climate: not, &s;ays he, for want of a land-pa&s;&s;age; but becau&s;e the cold climate of Tartary, in which &s;uch ani|mals cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, is an effectual bar again&s;t them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author, with a &s;ingular candor, admits it as a &s;trong objection to his theory, that there are no rain-deer in A&s;ia. But it is doing no more but ju&s;tice to &s;o fair a rea&s;oner, to ob&s;erve, that according to the late&s;t accounts, there are plenty of rain-deer in the country of Kam&s;katka, which of all is the neare&s;t to Ame|rica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But in my apprehen&s;ion, much more is required to give &s;atisfaction upon this &s;ubject, than a pa&s;|&s;age from Kam&s;katka to America, whether by land or &s;ea. An enquiry much more deci&s;ive is totally overlooked, relative to the people on the two &s;ides of the &s;treight; particularly, whether they &s;peak the &s;ame language. Now by late ac|counts from Ru&s;&s;ia we are informed, that there is no affinity between the Kam&s;katkan tongue, and that of the Americans on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treight. Whence we may conclude with great certainty, that the latter are not a colony of the former.</P>
<P>But I go farther. There are &s;everal cogent ar|guments to evince, that the Americans are not de&s;cended from any people in the north of A&s;ia or in the north of Europe. Were they de&s;cended from either, Labrador, or the adjacent countries,
<PB N="82" REF="86">
mu&s;t have been fir&s;t peopled. And as &s;avages are remarkably fond of their natal &s;oil, they would have continued there, till by over-population they &s;hould have been compelled to &s;pread wider for food. But the fact is directly contrary. When America was di&s;covered by the Spaniards, Mexico and Peru were fully peopled; and the other parts le&s;s and le&s;s, in proportion to their di&s;tance from the&s;e central countries. Fabry reports, that one may travel one or two hundred leagues north-we&s;t from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, without &s;eeing a human face, or any ve&s;tige of a hou&s;e. And &s;ome French officers &s;ay, that they travelled more than a hundred leagues from the delicious country watered by the Ohio, through Loui&s;iana, without meeting a &s;ingle family of &s;avages. Labrador is very thin of inhabitants; no people having been di&s;covered in it, but the E&s;quimaux, a very &s;mall tribe. And as that tribe has plenty of food at home, there is no appearance, that they ever &s;ent a colony to any other part of America. The civilization of the Mexicans and Peruvians, as well as their populou&s;ne&s;s, make it extremely probable that they were the fir&s;t inhabitants of America. In travelling northward, the people are more and more ignorant and &s;avage: the E&s;quimaux, the mo&s;t northern of all, are the mo&s;t &s;avage. In travelling &s;outhward, the Pa|tagonians, the mo&s;t &s;outhern of all, are &s;o &s;tupid as to go naked in a bitter cold region.</P>
<P>I venture &s;till farther; which is, to conjecture, that America has not bee peopled from any part of the old world. The external appearance of the inhabitants, makes this conjecture approach to a certainty; as that appearance differs widely from the appearance of any other known people. Excepting the eye-la&s;hes, eye-brows, and hair of
<PB N="83" REF="87">
the head, which is invariably jet black, there is not a &s;ingle hair on the body of any American&punc; not the lea&s;t appearance of a beard. Another di&s;tingui&s;hing mark is their copper-colour, uni|formly the &s;ame in all climates, hot and cold; and differing from the colour of all other nations. Ulloa remarks, that the Americans of Cape Breton, re&s;emble the Peruvians in complexion, in manners, and in cu&s;toms; the only vi&s;ible dif|ference being, that the former are of a larger &s;tature. A third circum&s;tance no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h|ing is, that American children are born with down upon the &s;kin, which di&s;appears the eighth or ninth day, and never grows again. Children of the old world are born with &s;kins &s;mooth and poli&s;hed, and no down appears till pu|berty.</P>
<P>That the original inhabitants of America are a race di&s;tinct from all others, I once thought de|mon&s;trable from &s;ome reports concerning the E&s;quimaux. The author of the hi&s;tory of New France, and &s;everal other writers report, that the E&s;quimaux are bold, mi&s;chievous, &s;u&s;picious, and untamable; that it is not even &s;afe to con|ver&s;e with them but at a di&s;tance; that no European &s;kin is whiter; and that they are beard|ed up to the eyes. Suppo&s;ing the&s;e facts to be true, had I not rea&s;on to believe, that the E&s;qui|maux mu&s;t have &s;prung from &s;ome nation in the north of Europe or A&s;ia, though I could not pretend to &s;ay, whether the tran&s;migration was by land or &s;ea? From the &s;ame facts, however, I was forced to conclude, that the re&s;t of the Americans could not have had the &s;ame origin: for if the Canadians or any other American na|tion were of A&s;iatic or European extraction, they mu&s;t, like the E&s;quimaux, have had a
<PB N="84" REF="88">
beard and white &s;kin to this day. But one cannot be too cautious in giving faith to odd or &s;ingular facts, reported of di&s;tant nations. It is di&s;covered by later accounts more worthy of credit, that the foregoing de&s;cription of the E&s;quimaux is fal&s;e in every particular. Of all the northern nations, not excepting the Lap|landers, the E&s;quimaux are of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, few of them exceeding four feet in height. They have heads extremely gro&s;s, feet and hands very &s;mall. That they are neither cruel nor &s;u&s;picious, appears from what Ellis &s;ays in his account of a voyage <HI>anno</HI> 1747, for di&s;|covering a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, that they offer|ed their wives to the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;atisfaction for being able to ac|commodate them. But what is the mo&s;t to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; they are of a copper colour, like the other Americans, only a degree lighter, occa&s;ioned probably by the inten&s;e cold of their climate; and they are al&s;o altogether de&s;titute of a beard. It is common indeed among them, to bring forward the hair of the head upon the face, for pre&s;erving it from flies, which rage in that country during &s;ummer; an appearance that probably has been mi&s;taken by travellers for a beard.</P>
<P>It has been lately di&s;covered, that the lan|guage of the E&s;quimaux is the &s;ame with that of the Greenlanders. A Dani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionary, who by &s;ome years re&s;idence in Greenland had acqui|red the language of that country, made a voy|age with Commodore Pali&s;er to Newfoundland ann. 1764. Meeting a company of about two hundred E&s;quimaux, he was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the Greenland tongue. They received him kindly, and drew from him a promi&s;e to re|turn
<PB N="85" REF="89">
the next year. And we are informed by Crantz, in his hi&s;tory of Greenland, that the &s;ame Dani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionary vi&s;ited them the very next year, in company with the Rev. Mr. Dra|chart. They agreed, that the difference be|tween the E&s;quimaux language and that of Greenland was not greater than between the dia|lects of North and South Greenland, which dif|fer not &s;o much as the High and Low Dutch. Both nations call them&s;elves <HI>Innuit</HI> or <HI>Karalit,</HI> and call the Europeans <HI>Kablunet.</HI> Their &s;tature, features, manners, dre&s;s, tents, darts, and boats, are entirely the &s;ame. As the language of Greenland re&s;embles not the language of Fin|land, Lapland, Norway, Tartary, nor that of the Samoides, it is evident, that neither the E&s;quimaux nor Greenlanders are a colony from any of the countries mentioned. Geographers begin now to conjecture, that Greenland is a part of the continent of North America, without intervention of any &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Danes had a &s;ettlement in Greenland long before Columbus &s;aw the We&s;t Indies. Would it not appear paradoxical to &s;ay, that America was di&s;cover|ed by the Danes long before the time of Columbus, and long before they knew that they had made the di&s;covery?</NOTE>. One thing is certain, that the Greenlanders re&s;emble the North-Ame|ricans in every particular: they are of a copper colour, and have no beard; they are of a &s;mall &s;ize, like the E&s;quimaux, and have the &s;ame language. And thus I am obliged to abandon my favourite argument, for proving the Ameri|cans, the E&s;quimaux excepted, to be indigenous, and not indebted to the old world for their exi&s;t|ence. At the &s;ame time, the other arguments urged above remain entire; and from what is now
<PB N="86" REF="90">
&s;aid a circum&s;tance occurs, that fortifies greatly the chief of them. People, who with a bold face &s;urmount all difficulties rather than give up a favourite opinion, make light of the copper co|lour and want of beard, willing to attribute all to the climate. We want <HI>data,</HI> I acknowledge, to determine with accuracy what effects can be pro|duced by a climate. But luckily we have no oc|ca&s;ion at pre&s;ent to determine that difficult point. It is &s;ufficient that the climate of Labrador is much the &s;ame with that of the northern parts of Europe and A&s;ia. From that circum&s;tance I conclude with certainty, that the copper colour and want of beard in the E&s;quimaux cannot be the re&s;ult of climate. And if &s;o, what foundation can there be for making the&s;e circum&s;tances de|pend on the climate in any other part of Ameri|ca? Truly none at all. I add, that as the cop|per colour and want of beard continue invariably the &s;ame in every variety of climate, hot and cold, moi&s;t and dry, they mu&s;t depend on &s;ome invariable cau&s;e acting uniformly; which may be a &s;ingularity in the race of people<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 1. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>, but cannot proceed from the climate.</P>
<P>If we can rely on the conjectures of an eminent writer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Buffon.</NOTE>, America emerged from the &s;ea later than any other part of the known world: and &s;uppo&s;ing the human race to have been planted in America by the hand of God later than the days of Mo&s;es, Adam and Eve might have been the fir&s;t parents of mankind, <HI>i. e.</HI> of all who at that time exi&s;ted, without being the fir&s;t parents of the Americans.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="91">
The <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis incognita</HI> is &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world by a wide ocean, which carries a &s;hip round the earth without interrup|tion. How has that continent been peopled? There is not the &s;lighte&s;t probability, that it ever has been joined to any other land. Here a local creation, if it may be termed &s;o, appears una|voidable; and if we mu&s;t admit more than one act of creation, even the appearance of difficulty, from reiteration of acts, totally vani&s;heth. M. Buffon, in his natural hi&s;tory, bears te&s;timony, that not a &s;ingle American quadruped of a hot cli|mate is found in any other part of the earth: with re&s;pect to the&s;e we mu&s;t unavoidably admit a local creation; and nothing &s;eems more natural, than under the &s;ame act to comprehend the fir&s;t parents of the American people.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, indeed, that a &s;hip with men and women may, by contrary winds, be carried to a very di&s;tant &s;hore. But to account thus for the peopling of America, will not be much reli&s;hed: Mexico and Peru mu&s;t have been planted before navigation was known in the old world, at lea&s;t before a &s;hip was brought to &s;uch perfection as to bear a long cour&s;e of bad weather. Will it be thought, that any &s;uppo&s;ition ought to be embra|ced, however improbable, rather than admit a &s;eparate creation? We are, it is true, much in the dark as to the conduct of creative Provi|dence; but every rational conjecture leans to a &s;eparate creation. America and the <HI>Terra Au|&s;tralis</HI> mu&s;t have been planted by the Almighty with a number of animals and vegetables, &s;ome of them peculiar to tho&s;e va&s;t continents: and when &s;uch care has been taken about inferior life, can &s;o wild a thought be admitted, as that man, the noble&s;t work of terre&s;trial creation, would be left to chance? But it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="92">
upon this topic, as the external characters of the Americans above mentioned reject the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being de&s;cended from any people of the old world.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that the fertile and de|licious plains of Peru and Mexico were the fir&s;t planted of all the American countries; being more populous at the time of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion than any other part of that great continent. This conjecture is &s;upported by analogy: we believe that a &s;pot, not centrical only, but extremely fertile, was cho&s;en for the parents of the old world; and there is not in America a &s;pot more centrical, or more fertile, than Mexico or Peru, for the parents of the new world.</P>
<P>Having thus ventured to throw out what oc|curred upon the origin of the Americans, with|out pretending to affirm any thing as certain, we proceed to their progre&s;s. The North-American tribes are remarkable with re&s;pect to one branch of their hi&s;tory, that, in&s;tead of advancing, like other nations, toward the maturity of &s;ociety and government, they continue to this hour in their original &s;tate of hunting and fi&s;hing. A ca&s;e &s;o &s;ingular rou&s;es our curio&s;ity; and we wi&s;h to be made acquainted with the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not the want of animals capable to be do|me&s;ticated, that obliges them to remain hunters and fi&s;hers. The hor&s;e, it is true, the &s;heep, the goat, were imported from Europe; but there are plenty of American quadrupeds no le&s;s docile than tho&s;e mentioned. There is, in particular, a &s;pecies of horned cattle peculiar to America, having long wool in&s;tead of hair, and an excre|&s;cence upon the &s;houlder like that of the Ea&s;t-In|dia buffalo. The&s;e wild cattle multiply exceed|ingly in the fertile countries which the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi traver&s;es; and Hennepin reports, that the Indi|ans,
<PB N="89" REF="93">
after killing numbers, take no part away but the tongue, which is reckoned a delicious mor&s;el. The&s;e creatures are not extremely wild; and, if taken young, are ea&s;ily tamed: a calf, when its dam is killed, will follow the hunter and lick his hand. The wool, the hide, the tallow, would be of great value in the Briti&s;h colonies.</P>
<P>If the &s;hepherd-&s;tate be not ob&s;tructed in America by want of proper cattle, the only ac|count that can or need be given is, paucity of in|habitants. Con&s;ider only the influence of cu&s;tom, in rivetting men to their local &s;ituation and man|ner of life: once hunters, they will always be hunters, till &s;ome cau&s;e more potent than cu&s;tom force them out of that &s;tate. Want of food, oc|ca&s;ioned by rapid population, brought on the &s;hepherd-&s;tate in the old world. That cau&s;e has not hitherto taken place in North America: the inhabitants, few in number, remain hunters and fi&s;hers, becau&s;e that &s;tate affords them a compe|tency of food. I am aware, that the natives have been decrea&s;ing in number from the time of the fir&s;t European &s;ettlements. But even at that time the country was ill peopled: take for exam|ple the country above de&s;cribed, &s;tretching north|we&s;t from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: the Europeans never had any footing there, and yet to this day it is little better than a de&s;ert. I give other exam|ples. The Indians who &s;urround the lake Nippi|&s;ong, from whence the river St. Laurence i&s;&s;ues, are in whole but five or &s;ix thou&s;and; and yet their country is of great extent: they live by hunting and fi&s;hing, having bows and arrows, but no fire-arms; and their cloathing is the &s;kins of bea&s;ts: they are &s;eldom, if ever, engaged in war; have no commerce with any other people, Indian or European, but live as if they had a

world to them&s;elves<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Account of North America by Major Robert Rogers.</NOTE>. If that country be ill peopled, it is not from &s;carcity of food; for the country is exten&s;ive, and well &s;tored with every &s;ort of game. On the &s;outh and we&s;t of the lake <HI>Superior,</HI> the country is level and fruitful all the way to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, having large plains co|vered with rank gra&s;s, and &s;carce a tree for hundreds of miles: the inhabitants enjoy the grea|te&s;t plenty of fi&s;h, fowl, deer, &amp;c.; and yet their numbers are far from being in proportion to their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In &s;hort, it is the conjecture of the able&s;t writers, that in the va&s;t extent of North America, when di&s;covered, there were not as many people, laying a&s;ide Mex|ico, as in the half of Europe.</P>
<P>Paucity of inhabitants explains clearly why the North-American tribes remain hunters and fi&s;h|ers, without advancing to the &s;hepherd-&s;tate. But if the foregoing difficulty be removed, an|other &s;tarts up, no le&s;s puzzling, viz. By what adver&s;e fate are &s;o rich countries &s;o ill peopled? It is a conjecture of M. Buffon, mentioned above, that America has been planted later than the other parts of this globe. But &s;uppo&s;ing the fact, it has however not been planted &s;o late as to prevent a great population, witne&s;s Mexico and Peru, fully peopled at the aera of the Spani&s;h in|va&s;ion. We mu&s;t therefore &s;earch for another cau&s;e; and none occurs but the infecundity of the North-American &s;avages. M. Buffon, a re|&s;pectable author, and for that rea&s;on often quo|ted, remarks, that the&s;e &s;avages are feeble in their organs of generation, that they have no ar|dor for the female &s;ex, and that they have few children; to enforce which remark he adds, that
<PB N="91" REF="95">
the quadrupeds of America, both native and tran|&s;planted, are of a diminutive &s;ize, compared with tho&s;e of the old world. A woman never ad|mits her hu&s;band, till the child &s;he is nur&s;ing be three years old; and this led Frenchmen to go often a&s;tray from their Canadian wives. The ca&s;e was reported by the prie&s;ts to their &s;uperiors in France; but what order was taken has e&s;caped my memory. Among the males, it is an invio|lable law, to ab&s;tain from females while they are engaged in a military expedition. This is preg|nant evidence of their frigidity; for among &s;ava|ges the authority of law, or of opinion, &s;eldom prevails over any &s;trong appetite: vain would be the attempt to re&s;train them from &s;pirituous li|quors, tho' much more debilitating. Neither is there any in&s;tance, of violence offered by any North-American &s;avage, to European women taken captives in war.</P>
<P>Mexico and Peru, when conquered by the Spaniards, afforded to their numerous inhabitants the nece&s;&s;aries of life in profu&s;ion. Cotton was in plenty, more than &s;ufficient for the cloathing needed in warm climates: Indian wheat was uni|ver&s;al, and was cultivated without much labour. The natural wants of the inhabitants were thus &s;upplied with very little trouble; and artificial wants had made no progre&s;s. But the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the&s;e countries is very different. The Indians have learned from their conquerors a mul|titude of artificial wants, good hou&s;es, variety of food, and rich cloaths, which mu&s;t be imported, becau&s;e not manufactured at home. They are prohibited from exerci&s;ing any art or calling ex|cept agriculture, which &s;carce affords them ne|ce&s;&s;aries; and this obliges a great proportion of them to live &s;ingle. Even agriculture it&s;elf is cramped; for in mo&s;t of the provinces there is a
<PB N="92" REF="96">
prohibition to plant vines or olives. In &s;hort, it is believed that the inhabitants who exi&s;ted at the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion are reduced to a fourth part. The &s;avages al&s;o of North-America who border on the European &s;ettlements are vi&s;ibly dimini&s;h|ing. When the Engli&s;h &s;ettled in America, the five nations could rai&s;e 15,000 fighting men: at pre&s;ent they are not able to rai&s;e 2000. Upon the whole it is computed by able writers, that the pre&s;ent inhabitants of America amount not to a twentieth part of tho&s;e who exi&s;ted when that continent was di&s;covered by Columbus. This decay is a&s;cribed to the intemperate u&s;e of &s;pirits, and to the &s;mall-pox, both of them introduced by the Europeans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In all the We&s;t-Indian colonies, the &s;laves conti|nually decrea&s;e &s;o as to need frequent recruits from Africa. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This decrea&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays the author of a late account of Guiana, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is commonly attributed to op|pre&s;&s;ion and hard labour; tho' with little rea&s;on, as the &s;laves are much more robu&s;t, healthy, and vi|gorous, than their ma&s;ters.

It is ob&s;ervable, that every &s;ort of plague becomes more virulent when tran&s;planted, than in its na|tive place. The plague commits le&s;s ravage in Egypt, its native place, than in any other coun|try. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e was for many ages more violent and de&s;tructive in Europe, than ever it was in America, where it was fir&s;t known. The people who &s;ailed with Chri&s;topher Colum|bus, brought it to Spain from Hi&s;paniola. Co|lumbus, with thirty or forty of his &s;ailors, went directly to Barcelona, where the King then was, to render an account of his voyage. All the in|habitants, who at that time tripled the pre|&s;ent number, were immediately &s;eized with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, which raged &s;o furiou&s;ly as to threaten de&s;truction to all. The &s;mall pox comes under the &s;ame ob&s;ervation; for it has &s;wept away many more in America, than ever it did in Europe. In the year 1713, the crew of a Dutch ve&s;&s;el infected the Hottentots with the &s;mall pox; which left &s;carce a third of the inhabi|tants. And the &s;ame fate befel the Laplanders and Greenlanders.

<P>But &s;pirituous liquors are a &s;till more effectual cau&s;e of depopulation.

<P>In the temperate climates of the old world, there is great uniformity in the gradual progre&s;s of men from the &s;avage &s;tate to the highe&s;t civi|lization; beginning with hunting and fi&s;hing, advancing to flocks and herds, and thereafter to agriculture and commerce. One would be much di&s;appointed if he expected the &s;ame progre&s;s in America. Among the northern tribes, there is nothing that re&s;embles the &s;hepherd-&s;tate: they continue hunters and fi&s;hers as originally; be|cau&s;e there is no cau&s;e &s;o potent as to force them from that &s;tate to become &s;hepherds. So far clear. But there is another fact of which we have no example in the old world, that &s;eems not &s;o ea&s;ily explained; the&s;e people, without pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;hepherd-&s;tate, have advan|ced to &s;ome degree of agriculture. Before the &s;eventeenth century, the Iroquois, or five nati|ons, had villages, and cultivated Indian corn: the Cherokees have many &s;mall towns; they rai&s;e corn in abundance, and fence in their fields: they breed poultry, and have orchards of peach|trees: The Chicke&s;aws and Creek Indians live
<PB N="95" REF="99">
pretty much in the &s;ame manner. The Apala|chites &s;ow and reap in common; and put up the corn in granaries, to be di&s;trubuted among in|dividuals when they want food. The Hurons rai&s;e great quantities of corn, not only for their own u&s;e, but for commerce. Many of the&s;e na|tions, particularly the Cherokees, have of late got hor&s;es, &s;wine, and tame cattle; an improve|ment borrowed from the Europeans. But corn is of an early date: when Sir Richard Greenville took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Virginia in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the natives had corn; and Hennepin a&s;&s;ures us, that the nations bordering on the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;ippi had corn long before they were vi&s;ited by any European. Hu&s;bandry, it is true, is among tho&s;e people &s;till in its infancy; being left to the women, who &s;ow, who reap, who &s;tore up in public granaries, and who di&s;tribute as need re|quires. The inhabitants of Guiana in South America, continue to this day hunters and fi&s;h|ers. But though they have neither flocks nor herds, they have &s;ome hu&s;bandry; for the wo|men plant ca&s;&s;ava, yams, and plantains. They make a liquor, like our ale, termed <HI>piworee,</HI> which they drink with their food. And though they are extremely fond of that liquor, their indolence makes them often neglect to provide again&s;t want. To a people having a violent pro|pen&s;ity to intemperance, as all &s;avages have, this improvidence is a ble&s;&s;ing; for otherwi&s;e they would wallow in perpetual drunkenne&s;s. They are by no means &s;ingular; for unconcern about futurity is the characteri&s;tic of all &s;avages. To forego an immediate for a di&s;tant enjoyment, can only be &s;ugge&s;ted by cultivated rea&s;on. When the Canary I&s;lands were fir&s;t vi&s;ited by the Eu|ropeans, which was in the fourteenth century, the inhabitants bad corn; for which the ground
<PB N="96" REF="100">
was prepared in the following manner. They had a wooden in&s;trument, not unlike a hoe, with a &s;pur or tooth at the end, on which was fixed a goat's horn. With this in&s;trument the ground was &s;tirred; and if rain came not in its proper &s;ea&s;on, water was brought by canals from the ri|vulets. It was the womens province to reap the corn: they took only the ears; which they thre&s;hed with &s;ticks, or beat with their feet, and then winnowed in their hands. Hu&s;bandry pro|bably will remain in its pre&s;ent &s;tate among American &s;avages; for as they are decrea&s;ing daily, they can have no difficulty about food. The fact however is &s;ingular, of a people u&s;ing corn before tame cattle: there mu&s;t be a cau&s;e, which, on better acquaintance with that people, will probably be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>America is full of political wonders. At the time of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, the Mexicans and Peruvians had made great advances toward the perfection of &s;ociety, while the northern tribes, &s;eparated from them by di&s;tance only, remained in the original &s;tate of hunters and fi&s;hers, and remain &s;o at this day. To explain the difference, appears difficult. It is &s;till more difficult to ex|plain, why the Mexicans and Peruvians, in|habitants of the torrid zone, were highly poli&s;h|ed in the arts of &s;ociety and government; con|&s;idering that in the old world, the inhabitants of the torrid zone are, for the mo&s;t part, little better than &s;avages. We are not &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with the natural hi&s;tory of America, nor with that of its people, to attempt an ex|planation of the&s;e wonders: it is however part of our ta&s;k, to &s;tate the progre&s;s of &s;ociety among the Mexicans and Peruvians; which cannot fail to amu&s;e the reader, as he will find the&s;e two na|tions differing e&s;&s;entially from the North-Ameri|can
<PB N="97" REF="101">
tribes, in every article of manners, govern|ment, and police.</P>
<P>When the Spaniards invaded America, the Mexicans were &s;kilful in agriculture. Maize was their chief grain, which, by careful culture, produced great plenty, even in the mountainous country of Tla&s;calla. They had gardening and botany, as well as agriculture: a phy&s;ic-garden belonging to the Emperor was open to every one for gathering medicinal plants.</P>
<P>The art of cookery was far advanced among that people. Montezuma's table was generally covered with 200 di&s;hes, many of them exqui|&s;itely dre&s;&s;ed in the opinion even of the Spaniards. They u&s;ed &s;alt, which was made by the &s;un.</P>
<P>The women were dexterous at &s;pinning; and manufactures of cotton and hair abounded every where.</P>
<P>The populou&s;ne&s;s of Mexico and Peru afford irrefragable evidence, that the arts of peace were there carried to a great height. The city of Mexico contained 60,000 families<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We cannot altogether rely on what is reported of this antient empire with re&s;pect to numbers. The ci|ty of Mexico, though con&s;iderably enlarged &s;ince the Spani&s;h conque&s;t, doth not at pre&s;ent contain more than 60,000 &s;ouls, including 20,000 Negroes and Mu|lattoes.</NOTE>; and Mon|tezuma had thirty va&s;&s;als who could bring into the field, each of them, 100,000 fighting men. Tla&s;calla, a neighbouring republic, governed by a &s;enate, was &s;o populous as to be almo&s;t a match for the Emperor of Mexico.</P>
<P>The public edifices in the city of Mexico, and hou&s;es of the nobility, were of &s;tone, and well built. The royal palace had thirty gates
<PB N="98" REF="102">
opening to as many &s;treets. The principal front was of ja&s;per, black, red, and white, well po|li&s;hed. Three &s;quares, built and adorned like the front, led to Montezuma's apartment, hav|ing large rooms, floors covered with mats of dif|ferent kinds, walls hung with a mixture of cot|ton-cloth and rabbit-furs; the innermo&s;t room adorned with hangings of feathers, beautified with various figures in lively colours. In that building, large ceilings were formed &s;o artifici|ally without nails, as to make the planks &s;u&s;tain each other. Water was brought into the city of Mexico, from a mountain at a league's di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Gold and &s;ilver were in &s;o high e&s;teem, that ve&s;&s;els made of the&s;e metals were permitted to none but to the Emperor. Con&s;idering the value put upon gold and &s;ilver, the want of current coin would argue great dulne&s;s in that nation, if in&s;tances did not daily occur of improvements, after being carried to a con&s;iderable height, &s;top|ping &s;hort at the very thre&s;hold of perfection. The want of current coin made fairs the more nece&s;&s;ary, which were carried on with the mo&s;t perfect regularity: judges on the &s;pot decided mercantile differences; and inferior officers, making con&s;tant circuits, pre&s;erved peace and order. The abundance and variety of the com|modities brought to market, and the order pre|&s;erved by &s;uch multitudes, amazed the Spani|ards; a &s;pectacle de&s;erving admiration, as a te&s;|timony of the grandeur and good government of that exten&s;ive empire.</P>
<P>The fine arts were not unknown in Mexico. Their gold&s;miths were excellent workmen, par|ticularly in moulding gold and &s;ilver into the form of animals. Their painters made land|&s;capes and other imitations of nature with fea|thers, &s;o artfully mixed as to be&s;tow both life
<PB N="99" REF="103">
and colouring; of which &s;ort of work, there were in&s;tances no le&s;s extraordinary for pati|ence than for &s;kill. Their drinking-cups were of the  fine&s;t earth exqui&s;itely made, differing from each other in colour, and even in &s;mell. Of the &s;ame materials, they made great variety of ve&s;&s;els both for u&s;e and ornament.</P>
<P>They were not ignorant either of mu&s;ic or of poetry; and one of their capital amu&s;ements was &s;ongs &s;et to mu&s;ic upon the atchievements of their kings and ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a progre&s;s both in the u&s;eful and fine arts, is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that though they had mea&s;ures, they knew nothing of weights?</P>
<P>As to the art of writing, a capital article in the conduct of government, they were extreme|ly deficient. That art, as mentioned above, was no farther advanced than the u&s;ing figures com|po&s;ed of painted feathers, by which they made a &s;hift to communicate &s;ome &s;imple thoughts; and in that manner was Montezuma informed of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>There was great ingenuity &s;hewn in regulating the calendar: the Mexican year was divided into 365 days; and into 18 months, containing 20 days each, which made 360; the remaining five intercalary days were added at the end of the year, for making it corre&s;pond to the cour&s;e of the &s;un. They religiou&s;ly employed the&s;e five days upon diver&s;ions, being of opinion that they were appropriated to that end by their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Murder, theft, and corruption in officers of &s;tate, were capital crimes. Adultery al&s;o was capital; for female cha&s;tity was in high e&s;tima|tion. At the &s;ame time, con&s;ent was deem|ed a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of divorce, the law leaving it to the parties concerned, who ought to be the
<PB N="100" REF="104">
be&s;t judges. In ca&s;e of a divorce, the father took care of the male children, leaving the fe|male children with the mother. But to prevent ra&s;h &s;eparations, it was capital for them to unite again.</P>
<P>It may be gathered from what has been &s;aid, that there was a di&s;tinction of rank among the Mexicans. So religiou&s;ly was it ob&s;erved, as to be di&s;played even in their buildings: the city of Mexico was divided into two parts, one appro|priated to the Emperor and nobility, and one left to plebeians.</P>
<P>Education of children was an important article in the Mexican police. Public &s;chools were al|lotted for plebeian children; and colleges well endowed for the &s;ons of the nobility, where they continued till they were fit for bu&s;ine&s;s. The ma&s;ters were con&s;idered as officers of &s;tate; not without rea&s;on, as their office was to qualify young men for &s;erving their king and country. Such of the young nobles as made choice of a military life, were &s;ent to the army, and made to &s;uffer great hard&s;hips before they could be inli&s;t|ed. They had indeed a powerful motive for per&s;everance, the mo&s;t honourable of all em|ployments being that of a &s;oldier. Young wo|men of quality were educated with no le&s;s care, by proper matrons cho&s;en with the utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection.</P>
<P>As hereditary nobility, e&s;pecially in an exten|&s;ive empire, leads to monarchy, the government of Mexico was monarchichal; and as the pro|gre&s;s of monarchy is from being elective to be hereditary, Mexico had advanced no farther than to be an elective monarchy, of which Montezu|ma was the eleventh king. It would in time have become hereditary, had it not been &s;ubdued by
<PB N="101" REF="105">
the Spaniards. And it was an example of an elective monarchy that approaches the neare&s;t to hereditary; for the power of election, as well as the privilege of being elected, were confined to the princes of the blood royal. As a talent for war was chiefly regarded in chu&s;ing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne, the Mexican kings always command|ed their own armies. The Emperor-elect, be|fore his coronation, was obliged to make &s;ome conque&s;t, or perform &s;ome warlike exploit; a cu&s;tom that &s;upported the military &s;pirit, and en|larged the kingdom. From every king was ex|acted a coronation-oath, to adhere to the religi|on of his ance&s;tors, to maintain the laws and cu&s;toms of the empire, and to be a father to his people.</P>
<P>The various affairs of government were di&s;tri|buted among different boards with great proprie|ty. The management of the royal patrimony was allotted to one board; appeals from inferior tribunals, to another; the levying of troops, and the providing of magazines, to a third: matters of &s;upreme importance were re&s;erved to a coun|cil of &s;tate, held generally in the king's pre&s;ence. The&s;e boards, all of them, were compo&s;ed of men experienced in the arts of war and of peace: the council of &s;tate was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who elected the Emperor.</P>
<P>Concerning the patrimony of the crown, mines of gold and &s;ilver belonged to the Emperor; and the duty on &s;alt brought in a great revenue. But the capital duty was, a third of the land-rents, the e&s;tates of the nobles excepted; upon whom no tribute was impo&s;ed, but to &s;erve in the army with a number of their va&s;&s;als, and to guard the Emperor's per&s;on. Goods manufactured and &s;old were &s;ubjected to a duty; which was not preju|dicial
<PB N="102" REF="106">
to their manufactures, becau&s;e there was no rival nation within reach.</P>
<P>Montezuma introduced a multitude of ceremo|nies into his court, tending to in&s;pire veneration for his per&s;on; an excellent policy in rude times, of however little &s;ignificancy among nations en|lightened and rational. Veneration and humility were &s;o much the tone of the court, that it was even thought indecent in the Mexican lords, to appear before the King in their riche&s;t habits. Ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver were appropriated to his table, and not permitted even to the princes of the blood. The table-cloths and napkins, made of the fine&s;t cotton, with the earthen ware, ne|ver made a &s;econd appearance at the Emperor's table, but were di&s;tributed among the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>In war, their offen&s;ive weapons were bows and arrows; and as iron was not known in America, their arrows were headed with bones &s;harpened at the point. They u&s;ed al&s;o darts, and long wooden &s;words, in which were fixed &s;harp flints; and men of more than ordinary &s;trength fought with clubs. They be&s;ide had &s;lingers, who threw &s;tones with great force and dexterity. Their defen&s;ive arms, u&s;ed only by commanders and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were a coat of quilted cotton, a &s;ort of brea&s;t-plate, and a &s;hield of wood or tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, adorned with plates of &s;uch metal as they could procure. The private men &s;ought naked; their faces and bodies being deformed with paint, in order to terrify the ene|my. They had warlike in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, &s;uch as &s;ea-&s;hells, flutes made of large canes, and a &s;ort of drum made of the trunk of a tree hollowed. Their battalions con&s;i&s;ted of great numbers crouded together, without even the ap|pearance of order. They attacked with fury, and terrible outcries, in order to intimidate the
<PB N="103" REF="107">
enemy; a practice prompted by nature, and for|merly u&s;ed by many nations. It was not de&s;pi&s;ed even by the Romans; for Cato the elder was wont to &s;ay, that he had obtained more victories by the throats of his &s;oldiers, than by their &s;words; and Cae&s;ar applauds his own &s;oldiers, above tho&s;e of Pompey, for their warlike &s;houts. Eagerne&s;s to engage is vented in loud cries: and the effects are excellent: they redouble the ardor of tho&s;e who attack, at the &s;ame time that they &s;trike terror into the enemy.</P>
<P>Their armies were formed with ea&s;e: the prin|ces of the empire, with the cacics or governors of provinces, were obliged to repair to the general rendezvous, each with his quota of men.</P>
<P>Their fortifications were trunks of large trees, fixed in the ground like palli&s;ades, leaving no in|tervals but what were barely &s;ufficient for di&s;|charging their arrows upon the enemy.</P>
<P>Military orders were in&s;tituted, with peculiar habits, as marks of di&s;tinction and honour; and each cavalier bore the device of his order, paint|ed upon his robe, or fixed to it. Montezuma founded a new order of knighthood, into which princes only were admitted, or nobles de&s;cended from the royal &s;tock; and as a token of its &s;upe|riority, he became one of its members. The knights of that order had part of their hair bound with a red ribbon, to which a ta&s;&s;el was fixed hanging down to the &s;houlder. Every new ex|ploit was honoured with an additional ta&s;&s;el; which made the knights with ardor embrace eve|ry opportunity to &s;ignalize them&s;elves. As no|thing can be better contrived than &s;uch a regula|tion for &s;upporting a military &s;pirit, the Mexi|cans would have been invincible had they under|&s;tood the order of battle: for want of which that potent empire fell a prey to a handful of &s;trangers.
<PB N="104" REF="108">
I differ from tho&s;e who a&s;cribe that event to the fire-arms of the Spaniards, and to their hor&s;es. The&s;e could not be more terrible to the Mexi|cans, than elephants were at fir&s;t to the Romans: but familiarity with the&s;e unwieldy animals, re|&s;tored to the Romans their wonted courage; and the Mexicans probably would have behaved like the Romans, had they equalled the Romans in the art of war.</P>
<P>When that illu&s;trious people, by their own ge|nius, without borrowing from others, had made &s;uch proficiency in the arts of peace, as well as of war; is it not &s;trange, that with re&s;pect to religion they were no better than &s;avages? They not only practi&s;ed human &s;acrifices, but dre&s;&s;ed and eat the fle&s;h of tho&s;e that were &s;acrificed. Their great temple was contrived to rai&s;e horror: upon the walls were multiplied the figures of nox|ious &s;erpents: the heads of per&s;ons &s;acrificed were &s;tuck up in different places, and carefully renewed when wa&s;ted by time. There were eight temples in the city, nearly of the &s;ame ar|chitecture; 2000 of a &s;maller &s;ize, dedicated to different idols; &s;carce a &s;treet without a tutelar deity; nor a calamity that had not an altar, to which the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed might have recour&s;e for a re|medy. Unparallelled ignorance and &s;tupidity, obliged every Emperor, at his coronation, to &s;wear, that there &s;hould be no un&s;ea&s;onable rains, no overflowing of rivers, no fields affected with &s;terility, nor any man hurt with the bad influen|ces of the &s;un. In &s;hort, it was a &s;lavi&s;h religi|on, built upon fear, not love. At the &s;ame time, they believed the immortality of the &s;oul, and rewards and puni&s;hments in a future &s;tate; which made them bury with their dead, quanti|ties of gold and &s;ilver, for defraying the expence of their journey; and al&s;o made them put to
<PB N="105" REF="109">
death &s;ome of their &s;ervants to attend them. Women &s;ometimes, actuated with the &s;ame be|lief, were authors of their own death, in order to accompany their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>The author that we mu&s;t chiefly rely on for an account of Peru is Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega: tho' he may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of partiality; for being of the Inca race, he be&s;tows on the Peruvian go|vernment, improvements of later times. The ar|ticles that appear the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picious are what fol|low.</P>
<P>The principle of the Peruvian con&s;titution &s;eems to have been an Agrarian law, of the &s;trict|e&s;t kind. To the &s;overeign was fir&s;t allotted a large proportion of land, for defraying the ex|pences of government; and the remainder was divided among his &s;ubjects in proportion to the number of each family. The&s;e portions were not alienable: the &s;overeign was held proprietor of the whole, as in the feudal &s;y&s;tem; and from time to time the di&s;tribution was varied according to the circum&s;tances of families. This Agrarian law contributed undoubtedly to the populou&s;ne&s;s of the kingdom of Peru.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ure &s;ign of improved agriculture, that aqueducts were made by the Peruvians for wa|tering their land. Their plough was of wood, a yard long, flat before, round behind, and point|ed at the end for piercing the ground. Agricul|ture &s;eems to have been carried on by united la|bour: lands appropriated for maintaining the poor were fir&s;t ploughed; next the portion al|lotted to &s;oldiers performing duty in the field: then every man &s;eparately ploughed his own field; after which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted his neighbour: they pro|ceeded to the portion of the curaca or lord: and la&s;tly to the King's portion. In the month of
<PB N="106" REF="110">
March they reaped their maize, and celebrated the harve&s;t with joy and fea&s;ting.</P>
<P>There being no arti&s;t nor manufacturer by profe&s;&s;ion, individuals were taught to do every thing for them&s;elves. Every one knew how to plough and manure the land: every one was a carpenter, a ma&s;on, a &s;hoemaker, a weaver, &amp;c. and the women were the mo&s;t ingenious and dili|gent of all. Blas Valera mentions a law, named <HI>the law of brotherhood,</HI> which, without the pro|&s;pect of reward, obliged them to be mutually aid|ing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in ploughing, &s;owing, and reap|ing, in building their hou&s;es, and in every &s;ort of occupation.</P>
<P>As the art was unknown of melting down me|tals by means of bellows, long copper pipes were contrived, contracted at the further end, that the breath might act the more forcibly on the fire; and they u&s;ed ten or twelve of the&s;e pipes toge|ther, when they wanted a very hot fire. Ha|ving no iron, their hatchets and pick-axes were of copper, and they had neither &s;aw nor augre, nor any in&s;trument of iron: ignorant of the u&s;e of nails, they tied their timber with cords of hemp. The tool they had for cutting &s;tone, was a &s;harp flint; and with that tool they &s;haped the &s;tone by continual rubbing, more than by cut|ting. Having no engines for rai&s;ing &s;tones, they did all by &s;trength of arm. The&s;e defects not|with&s;tanding, they erected great edifices; wit|ne&s;s the fortre&s;s of Cu&s;co, a &s;tupendous fabric. It pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding, by what means the &s;tones, or rather the great rocks, employed in that building, were brought from the quarry. One of the&s;e &s;tones, mea&s;ured by Aco&s;ta, was thirty feet in length, eighteen in breadth, and &s;ix in thickne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="111">
Having neither &s;ci&s;&s;ars nor needles of metal, they u&s;ed a certain long thorn for a needle. The mirrors u&s;ed by ladies of quality were of burni&s;h|ed copper: but &s;uch implements of dre&s;s were reckoned too effeminate for the men.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to mu&s;ic, they had an in&s;tru|ment of hollow canes glewed together, the notes of which were like tho&s;e of an organ. They had love-&s;ongs accompanied with a pipe; and war-&s;ongs, which were their fe&s;tival entertain|ment. They compo&s;ed and acted comedies and tragedies. The art of writing, properly &s;o call|ed, was unknown: but &s;ilken threads, with knots ca&s;t upon them of divers colours, enabled them to keep exact accounts, and to &s;um them up with a readine&s;s that would have rivaled an expert European arithmetician. They had al&s;o attained to as much geometry as to mea&s;ure their fields.</P>
<P>In war, their offen&s;ive arms were the bow and arrow, lance, dart, club, and bill. Their de|fen&s;ive arms, were the helmet and target. The army was provided from the King's &s;tores, and was no burden upon the people.</P>
<P>In philo&s;ophy, they had made no progre&s;s. An eclip&s;e of the moon was attributed to her be|ing &s;ick; and they fancied the milky way to be a ewe giving &s;uck to a lamb. With regard to the &s;etting &s;un, they &s;aid, that he was a good &s;wim|mer, and that he pierced through the waves, to ri&s;e next morning in the ea&s;t. But &s;uch igno|rance is not wonderful; for no branch of &s;cience can make a progre&s;s without writing.</P>
<P>The people were divided into &s;mall bodies of ten families each: every divi&s;ion had a head, and a regi&s;ter was kept of the whole; a branch of public police, that very much re&s;embles the Eng|li&s;h decennaries.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="112">
They made but two meals, one between eight and nine in the morning, the other before &s;un|&s;et. Idlene&s;s was puni&s;hed with infamy: even children were employed according to their capa|city. Public vi&s;itors or monitors were appointed, having acce&s;s to every hou&s;e, for in&s;pecting the manners of the inhabitants; who were rewarded or puni&s;hed according to their behaviour. Mo|deration and indu&s;try were &s;o effectually enforced by this article of police, that few were reduced to indigence; and the&s;e got their food and cloth|ing out of the King's &s;tores.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their laws and cu&s;toms, chil|dren were bound to &s;erve their parents until the age of twenty five; and marriage contracted before that time, without con&s;ent of parents, was null. Polygamy was prohibited, and per&s;ons were con|fined to marry within their own tribe. The tra|dition, that the Inca family were children of the &s;un, introduced ince&s;t among them; for it was a matter of religion to pre&s;erve their divine blood pure and unmixed.</P>
<P>It was the chief article of the Peruvian creed, upon which every other article of their religion depended, that the Inca family were children of their great god the &s;un, and &s;ent by him to &s;pread his wor&s;hip and his laws among them. Nothing could have a greater influence upon an ignorant and credulous people, than &s;uch a doctrine. The &s;anctity of the Inca family was &s;o deeply rooted in the hearts of the Peruvians, that no per&s;on of that family was thought capable of committing a crime. Such blind veneration for a family, makes it probable, that the government of Peru under the Incas had not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted many years; for a government founded upon deceit and &s;uper&s;tition, cannot long continue its authority. However that be, &s;uch belief of the origin of the Incas, is
<PB N="109" REF="113">
evidence of great virtue and moderation in that family; for any gro&s;s act of tyranny or inju&s;tice, would have opened the eyes of the people to &s;ee their error. Moderation in the &s;overeign, and in the &s;ubjects obedience without re&s;erve, cannot fail to produce a government mild and gentle; which was verified in that of Peru, &s;o mild and gentle, that to manure and cultivate the lands of the Inca, and to &s;ay up the produce in &s;tore|hou&s;es, were the only burdens impo&s;ed upon the people, if it was not &s;ometimes to make cloaths and weapons for the army. At the &s;ame time their kings were &s;o revered, that the&s;e articles of labour were performed with great alacrity.</P>
<P>The government was equally gentle with regard to puni&s;hments. Indeed very few crimes were committed, being con&s;idered as a &s;ort of rebellion again&s;t their great god the &s;un. The only crime that &s;eems to have been puni&s;hed with &s;everity, is the marauding of &s;oldiers; for death was inflicted, however incon&s;iderable the damage.</P>
<P>In this empire, there appears to have been the mo&s;t perfect union between law and religion; which could not fail to produce obedience, order, and tranquility, among that people, though ex|tremely numerous. The Inca family was famed for moderation: they made conque&s;ts in order to civilize their neighbours; and as they &s;eldom if ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds of morality, no other art was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the government entire, but to keep the people ignorant of true religion. They had virgins dedicated to the &s;un, who, like the ve&s;tal virgins in Rome, were under a vow of perpetual cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject &s;hall be concluded with &s;ome &s;light ob&s;ervations on the two governments I have been de&s;cribing. Comparing them together, the Mex|ican
<PB N="110" REF="114">
government &s;eems to have been &s;upported by arms; that of Peru by religion.</P>
<P>The kings of Peru were hereditary and ab&s;o|lute: tho&s;e of Mexico elective. In contradiction however to political principles, the government of Peru was by far the milder. It is mentioned above, that the electors of the Mexican kings were hereditary princes; and the &s;ame electors compo&s;ed the great council of &s;tate. Monte&s;quieu therefore has been mi&s;informed when he terms this a de&s;potic monarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des loix, liv. 17. ch. 2.</NOTE>: a monarchy can never be de&s;potic, where the &s;overeign is limited by a great council, the members of which are in|dependent of him. As little rea&s;on has he to term Peru de&s;potic. An ab&s;olute monarchy it was, but the farthe&s;t in the world from being de&s;potic: on the contrary, we find not in hi&s;tory any government &s;o well contrived for the good of the people. An Agrarian law, firmly rooted, prevented that great inequality of rank and riches which lead to luxury, and di&s;&s;olution of manners: a commonwealth was naturally the re&s;ult of &s;uch a con&s;titution; and probably would have taken place, had it not been for a government no le&s;s &s;uitable, and &s;till more mild, viz. a theocracy under a family &s;ent from heaven to make them happy. This wild opinion, &s;upported by igno|rance and &s;uper&s;tition, proved an effectual bar again&s;t tyranny in the monarch; a mo&s;t exempla|ry conduct on his part being nece&s;&s;ary for &s;up|porting the opinion of his divinity. Upon the whole, comprehending king and &s;ubject, there perhaps never exi&s;ted more virtue in any other

government, whether monarchical or republi|can.</P>
<P>In Peru there are traces of &s;ome di&s;tinction of ranks, ari&s;ing probably from office merely, which, as in France, were a bulwark to the monarch again&s;t the pea&s;ants. The great &s;uperiority of the Peruvian Incas, as demi-gods, did not admit a he|reditary nobility.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the progre&s;s of arts and manu|factures, the two nations differed widely: in Mexico, arts and manufactures were carried to a &s;urpri&s;ing height, con&s;idering the tools they had to work with: in Peru, they had made no progre&s;s, every man, as among mere &s;avages, providing the nece&s;&s;aries of life for him&s;elf. As the world goes at pre&s;ent, &s;uch numbers are employed upon our multiplied wants, that not above one of a hund|red can be &s;pared for war. In ancient times, when the&s;e wants were few, and not much en|larged beyond nature, it is computed that an eighth part could be &s;pared for war: and hence the numerous armies we read of in the hi&s;tory of ancient nations. The Peruvians had it in their power to go &s;till farther: it was po&s;&s;ible to arm the whole males capable of &s;ervice: leaving the women to &s;upply the few nece&s;&s;aries that might be wanted during a &s;hort campaign; and ac|cordingly we find that the Incas were great con|querors.</P>
<P>The religion of the Peruvians, con&s;idered in a political light, was excellent. The veneration they paid their &s;overeign upon a fal&s;e religious principle, was their only &s;uper&s;tition; and that &s;uper&s;tition contributed greatly to improve their morals and their manners: on the other hand, the religion of Mexico was abominable.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="116">
Upon the whole, there never was a country de&s;titute of iron, where arts &s;eem to have been carried higher than in Mexico; and, bating their religion, there never was a country de&s;titute of writing, where government &s;eems to have been more perfect. I except not the government of Peru, which, not being founded on political prin|ciples, but on &s;uper&s;tition, might be more mild, but was far from being &s;o &s;olidly founded.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MORALITY, theology, and the art of rea|&s;oning, are three great branches of a learn|ed education; and are ju&s;tly held to be &s;o, be|cau&s;e they are our only &s;ure guides in pa&s;&s;ing through the intricate paths of life. They are indeed not e&s;&s;ential to tho&s;e termed <HI>men of the world:</HI> the mo&s;t profound philo&s;opher makes but an in&s;ipid figure in fa&s;hionable company; would be &s;omewhat ridicu|lous at a court-ball; and an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity among the game&s;ters at Arthur's, or jockeys at New|market. But, the&s;e cogent objections notwith&s;tand|ing, I venture to pronounce &s;uch &s;tudies to be not al|together
<PB N="114" REF="118">
un&s;uitable to a gentleman. Man is a creature full of curio&s;ity; and to gratify that appe|tite, many roam through the world, &s;ubmitting to heat and cold, nay to hunger and thir&s;t, without a &s;igh. Could indeed that trouble&s;ome gue&s;t be expelled, we might hug our&s;elves in ignorance; and, like true men of the world, undervalue knowledge, that can neither procure money, nor a new &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ure. But, alas! the expul&s;ion is not in the power of every one; and tho&s;e who have not that power, will probably think it not ami&s;s, to employ their curio&s;ity upon &s;tudies that make them good mem|bers of &s;ociety, and endear them to every per&s;on of virtue.</P>
<P>And were we even men of the world in &s;uch per|fection, as to regard nothing but our own intere&s;t; yet does not ignorance lay us open to the crafty and de&s;igning? and does not the art of rea&s;oning guard many an hone&s;t man from being mi&s;led by &s;ubtle &s;o|phi&s;ms? With re&s;pect to right and wrong, not even pa&s;&s;ion is more dangerous than error. And as to re|ligion, better it were to &s;ettle in a conviction that there is no God, than to be in a &s;tate of wavering and &s;luctuation; &s;ometimes indulging every loo&s;e de|&s;ire, as if we were not accountable beings; and &s;ometimes yielding to &s;uper&s;titious fears, as if there were no god but the devil. To a well-di&s;po&s;ed mind, the exi&s;tence of a &s;upreme benevolent Deity, appears highly probable: and if happily the &s;tudy of theology lead us to a conviction that there really is &s;uch a be|ing; the conviction will be a &s;ource of con&s;tant en|joyment, which I boldly &s;et above the titillating plea|&s;ures of external &s;en&s;e. Po&s;&s;ibly there may be le&s;s pre&s;ent amu&s;ement in ab&s;tract &s;tudies, than in news|papers, in party-pamphlets, or in Hoyle upon Whi&s;t: but let us for a moment anticipate futurity, and ima|gine that we are reviewing pa&s;t tran&s;actions,&mdash;how plea&s;ant the retro&s;pect of tho&s;e who have maintained

the dignity of their nature, and employed their ta|lents to the be&s;t purpo&s;es!</P>
<P>Contradictory opinions that have influence on prac|tice, will be regretted by every per&s;on of a &s;ound heart; and as erroneous opinions are commonly the re&s;ult of imperfect education, I would gladly hope, that a remedy is not altogether out of reach. At the revival of arts and &s;ciences, the learned languages were our &s;ole &s;tudy, becau&s;e in them were locked up all the trea&s;ures of u&s;eful knowledge. This &s;tudy has long ago cea&s;ed to be the chief object of educati|on; and yet the original plan is handed down to us with very little variation. Wi&s;hing to contribute to a more perfect &s;y&s;tem of education, I pre&s;ent to the public the following &s;ketches. The books that have been publi&s;hed upon morality, theology, and the art of rea&s;oning, are not eminent either for &s;implicity, or for clear ideas. To introduce the&s;e into the &s;ubjects mentioned, is my aim; with what &s;ucce&s;s, is chear|fully &s;ubmitted to the judgment of others. The hi&s;|torical part, hitherto much neglected, is nece&s;&s;ary as a branch of my general plan; and I am hopeful, that be&s;ide in&s;truction, it will contribute to recreation, which, in ab&s;tract &s;tudies, is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than plea&s;ant.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PRINCIPLES OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY affirmation whatever be the &s;ubject, is termed a <HI>propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Truth and error are qualities of propo&s;itions. A propo&s;ition that &s;ays a thing is what it is in re|ality, is termed a <HI>true propo&s;ition.</HI> A propo&s;ition that &s;ays a thing is what it is not in reality, is termed an <HI>erroneous propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Our knowledge of what is agreeable and di&s;a|greeable in objects is derived from the &s;en&s;e of beauty, handled in Elements of Critici&s;m. Our knowledge of right and wrong in actions, is de|rived from the moral &s;en&s;e, to be handled in the &s;ketch immediately following. Our knowledge of truth and error is derived from various &s;our|ces.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="121">
Our external &s;en&s;es are one &s;ource of know|ledge: they lay open to us external &s;ubjects, their qualities, their actions, with events produced by the&s;e actions. The internal &s;en&s;es are another &s;ource of knowledge: they lay open to us things pa&s;&s;ing in the mind; thinking, for example, de|liberating, inclining, re&s;olving, willing, con&s;ent|ing, and other actions; and they al&s;o lay open to us our emotions and pa&s;&s;ions. There is a &s;en&s;e by which we perceive the truth of many propo&s;i|tions; &s;uch as, That every thing which begins to exi&s;t, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e; That every effect adapted to &s;ome end or purpo&s;e, proceeds from a de&s;igning cau&s;e; and, That every effect adapted to a good end or purpo&s;e, proceeds from a de|&s;igning and benevolent cau&s;e. A multitude of axioms in every &s;cience, particularly in mathe|matics, are perceived to be equally true. By a peculiar &s;en&s;e, of which afterward, we know that there is a Deity. By another &s;en&s;e we know, that the external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion are the &s;ame in all men; that animals of the &s;ame external ap|pearance, are of the &s;ame &s;pecies; and that ani|mals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, have the &s;ame proper|ties<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 1. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>. By another &s;en&s;e we &s;ee into futurity: we know that the &s;un will ri&s;e to-morrow; that the earth will perform its wonted cour&s;e round the &s;un; that winter and &s;ummer will follow each other in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; that a &s;tone dropt from the hand will fall to the ground; and a thou&s;and other &s;uch propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>There are many propo&s;itions, the truth of which is not &s;o apparent: a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning is nece&s;&s;ary, of which afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="122">
Human te&s;timony is another &s;ource of know|ledge. So framed are we by nature, as to rely on human te&s;timony; by which we are informed of beings, attributes, and events, that never came under any of our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The knowledge that is derived from the &s;ources mentioned, is of different kinds. In &s;ome ca&s;es, our knowledge includes ab&s;olute certainty, and produces the highe&s;t degree of conviction: in other ca&s;es, probability comes in place of certain|ty, and the conviction is inferior in degree. Know|ledge of the latter kind is di&s;tingui&s;hed into belief, which concerns facts; and opinion, which con|cerns relations, and other things that fall not un|der the denomination of facts. In contradi&s;tinc|tion to opinion and belief, that &s;ort of know|ledge which includes ab&s;olute certainty, and pro|duces the highe&s;t degree of conviction, retains its proper name. To explain what is here &s;aid, I enter into particulars.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, with very few exceptions, affords knowledge in its proper &s;en&s;e. It is not in our power to doubt of the exi&s;tence of a per&s;on we &s;ee, touch, and conver&s;e with; and when &s;uch is our con&s;titution, it is a vain attempt to call in que&s;tion the authority of our &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, as &s;ome writers pretend to do. No one ever call|ed in que&s;tion the exi&s;tence of internal actions and pa&s;&s;ions, laid open to us by internal &s;en&s;e; and there is as little ground for doubting of what we &s;ee. The &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, it is true, is not always correct: through different mediums the &s;ame object is &s;een differently: to a jaundiced eye every thing appears yellow; and to one intoxi|cated with liquor, two candles &s;ometimes appear four. But we are never left without remedy in &s;uch a ca&s;e: it is the province of the rea&s;oning faculty, to correct every error of that kind.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="123">
An objection of &s;ight, when recalled to mind by the power of memory, is termed an <HI>idea</HI> or &s;econdary perception. An original perception, as &s;aid above, affords knowledge in its proper &s;en&s;e; but a &s;econdary perception affords belief only. And Nature in this, as in all other in&s;tances, is faithful to truth; for it is evident, that we cannot be &s;o certain of the exi&s;tence of an object in its ab&s;ence, as when pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to many ab&s;tract propo&s;itions, of which in&s;tances are above given, we have an ab|&s;olute certainty and conviction of their truth, derived to us from various &s;en&s;es. We can, for example, entertain as little doubt, that every thing which begins to exi&s;t, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, as that the &s;un is in the firmament; and as little doubt that he will ri&s;e to-morrow, as that he is now &s;et. There are many other propo&s;itions, the truth of which is probable only, not ab&s;olutely certain; as, for example, that things will conti|nue in their ordinary &s;tate. That natural ope|rations are performed in the &s;imple&s;t manner, is an axiom of natural philo&s;ophy: it may be pro|bable, but is far from being certain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have given this propo&s;ition a place, becau&s;e it is a&s;&s;umed as an axiom by all writers on natural philo|&s;ophy. And yet there appears &s;ome room for doubting, whether the conviction we have of it do not proceed from a bias in our nature, rather than from an original &s;en&s;e. Our ta&s;te for &s;implicity, which undoubtedly is natural, renders &s;imple operations more agreeable than what are complex, and con&s;equently makes them ap|pear more natural. It de&s;erves a mo&s;t &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether the operations of nature be always carried on with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, or whether we be not mi&s;|led by our ta&s;te for &s;implicity, to be of that opinion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="124">
In every one of the in&s;tances given, conviction ari&s;es from a &s;ingle act of perception: for which rea&s;on, knowledge acquired by means of that perception, not only knowledge in its proper &s;en&s;e, but al&s;o opinion and belief, are termed <HI>intuitive knowledge.</HI> But there are many things, the knowledge of which is not obtained with &s;o much facility. Propo&s;itions for the mo&s;t part require a proce&s;s or operation in the mind, termed <HI>rea&s;oning;</HI> leading, by certain intermediate &s;teps, to the propo&s;ition that is to be demon&s;trated or made evident; which, in oppo&s;ition to intuitive knowledge, is termed <HI>di&s;cur&s;ive knowledge.</HI> This proce&s;s or operation mu&s;t be explained, in order to under&s;tand the nature of rea&s;oning. And as rea&s;oning is mo&s;tly employed in di&s;covering relati|ons, I &s;hall draw my examples from them. Every propo&s;ition concerning relations, is an affirmation of a certain relation between two &s;ubjects. If the relation affirmed appear not intuitively, we mu&s;t &s;earch for a third &s;ubject, that appears in|tuitively to be connected with each of the others, by the relation affirmed: and if &s;uch a &s;ubject be found, the propo&s;ition is demon&s;trated; for it is intuitively certain, that two &s;ubjects, connected with a third by any particular relation, mu&s;t be connected together by the &s;ame relation. The longe&s;t chain of rea&s;oning may be linked together in this manner. Running over &s;uch a chain, every one of the &s;ubjects mu&s;t appear intuitively to be connected with that immediately preceding, and with that immediately &s;ub&s;equent, by the relation affirmed in the propo&s;ition; and from the whole united, the propo&s;ition, as above mention|ed, mu&s;t appear intuitively certain. The la&s;t &s;tep of the proce&s;s is termed <HI>a conclu&s;ion,</HI> being the la&s;t or concluding perception.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="125">
No &s;ort of rea&s;oning affords &s;o clear a notion of the foregoing progre&s;s, as that which is mathematical. Equality is the only mathematical relation; and compari&s;on therefore is the only means by which mathematical propo&s;itions are a&s;certained. To that &s;cience belong a &s;et of intuitive propo&s;itions, termed <HI>axioms,</HI> which are all founded on equality. For ex|ample: Divide two equal lines, each of them, into a thou&s;and equal parts, a &s;ingle part of the one line mu&s;t be equal to a &s;ingle part of the other. Second: Take ten of the&s;e parts from the one line, and as many from the other, and the remaining parts mu&s;t be equal: which is more &s;hortly expre&s;|&s;ed thus: From two equal lines take equal parts, and the remainders will be equal; or add equal parts, and the &s;ums will be equal. Third: If two things be, in the &s;ame re&s;pect, equal to a third, the one is equal to the other in the &s;ame re&s;pect. I proceed to &s;how the u&s;e of the&s;e axi|oms. Two things may be equal without being intuitively &s;o; which is the ca&s;e of the equality between the three angles of a triangle and two right angles. To demon&s;trate that truth, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for &s;ome other angles, which appear by intuition to be equal to both. If this property cannot be di&s;covered in any one &s;et of angles, we mu&s;t go more lei&s;urely to work, by trying to find angles that are equal to the three angles of a triangle. The&s;e being di&s;covered, we next try to find other angles equal to the an|gles now di&s;covered; and &s;o on in the compari&s;on, till at la&s;t we di&s;cover a &s;et of angles, equal not only to tho&s;e thus introduced, but al&s;o to two right angles. We thus connect the two parts of the original propo&s;ition, by a number of interme|diate equalities; and by that means perceive, that the&s;e two parts are equal among them&s;elves: it being an intuitive propo&s;ition, as mentioned
<PB N="122" REF="126">
above, That two things are equal, each of which in the &s;ame re&s;pect, is equal to a third.</P>
<P>I proceed to a different example, which con|cerns the relation between cau&s;e and effect. The propo&s;ition to be demon&s;trated is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That there exi&s;ts a good and intelligent Being, who is the cau&s;e of all the wi&s;e and benevolent effects that are produced in the government of this world."</Q> That there are &s;uch effects, is in the pre&s;ent ex|ample the fundamental propo&s;ition, which is ta|ken for granted, becau&s;e it is verified by experi|ence. In order to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the&s;e ef|fects, I begin with an intuitive propo&s;ition men|tioned above, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That every effect adapted to a good end or purpo&s;e, proceeds from a de&s;ign|ing and benevolent cau&s;e."</Q> The next &s;tep is, to examine whether man can be the cau&s;e: he is provided indeed with &s;ome &s;hare of wi&s;dom and benevolence; but the effects mentioned are far above his power, and no le&s;s above his wi&s;dom. Neither can this earth be the cau&s;e, nor the &s;un, the moon, the &s;tars; for, far from being wi&s;e and benevolent, they are not even &s;en&s;ible. If the&s;e be excluded, we are unavoidably led to an invi&s;ible being, endowed with boundle&s;s power, goodne&s;s, and intelligence; and that invi&s;ible be|ing is termed <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;oning requires two mental powers, name|ly, the powers of invention, and of perceiving relations. By the former are di&s;covered interme|diate propo&s;itions, equally related to the funda|mental propo&s;ition, and to the conclu&s;ion: and by the latter we perceive, that the different links which compo&s;e the chain of rea&s;oning, are all connected together by the &s;ame relation.</P>
<P>We can rea&s;on about matters of opinion and be|lief, as well as about matters of knowledge, pro|perly &s;o termed. Hence rea&s;oning is di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="123" REF="127">
into two kinds; demon&s;trative, and probable. Demon&s;trative rea&s;oning is al&s;o of two kinds; in the fir&s;t, the conclu&s;ion is drawn from the nature and inherent properties of the &s;ubject: in the o|ther, the conclu&s;ion is drawn from &s;ome principle, of which we are certain by intuition. With re|&s;pect to the fir&s;t, we have no &s;uch knowledge of the nature or inherent properties of any being, material or immaterial, as to draw conclu&s;ions from it with certainty. I except not even figure con&s;idered as a quality of matter, tho' it is the object of mathematical rea&s;oning. As we have no &s;tandard for determining with preci&s;ion the fi|gure of any portion of matter, we cannot with preci&s;ion rea&s;on upon it: what appears to us a &s;traight line may be a curve, and what appears a rectilinear angle may be curvilinear. How then comes mathematical rea&s;oning to be demon&s;tra|tive? This que&s;tion may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight puz|zling; and I know not that it has any where been di&s;tinctly explained. Perhaps what follows may be &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of arithmetical rea&s;oning are num|bers. The &s;ubjects of mathematical rea&s;oning are figures. But what figures are &s;ubjects of mathematical rea&s;oning? Not &s;uch as I &s;ee; but &s;uch as I form an idea of, ab&s;tracting from every imperfection. I explain my&s;elf. There is a power in man to form images of things that never exi&s;ted; a golden mountain, for example, or a river running upward. This power operates up|on figures. There is perhaps no figure exi&s;ting the &s;ides of which are &s;traight lines. But it is ea|&s;y to form an idea of a line, that has no waving or crookedne&s;s in it; and it is ea&s;y to form an idea of a figure bounded by &s;uch lines. Such ideal figures are the &s;ubjects of mathematical rea|&s;oning; and the&s;e being perfectly clear and di|&s;tinct,
<PB N="124" REF="128">
are proper &s;ubjects for demon&s;trative rea|&s;oning of the fir&s;t kind. Mathematical rea&s;oning however is not merely a mental entertainment: it is of real u&s;e in life, by directing the powers and properties of matter. There po&s;&s;ibly may not be found any where a perfect globe, to an|&s;wer the idea we form of that figure: but a globe may be made &s;o near perfection, as that the properties demon&s;trated to belong to the idea of a perfect globe will be nearly applicable to that figure. In a word, tho' ideas are, properly &s;peaking, the &s;ubject of mathematical evidence; yet the end and purpo&s;e of that evidence is, to di|rect us with re&s;pect to figures as they really ex|i&s;t; and the nearer any real figure approaches to the idea we form of it, with the greater accuracy will the mathematical truth be applicable.</P>
<P>The component parts of figures, viz. lines and angles, are extremely &s;imple, requiring no defi|nition. Place before a child a crooked line, and one that has no appearance of being crooked; call the former a <HI>crooked line,</HI> the latter a <HI>&s;traight line;</HI> and the child will u&s;e the&s;e terms familiarly, without hazard of a mi&s;take. Draw a perpendi|cular upon paper; let the child advert, that the upward line leans neither to the right nor the left, and for that rea&s;on is termed <HI>a perpendicular:</HI> the child will apply that term familiarly to a tree, to the wall of a hou&s;e, or to any other perpendi|cular. In the &s;ame manner, place before the child two lines diverging from each other, and two that have no appearance of diverging: call the latter <HI>parallel lines,</HI> and the child will have no difficulty of applying the &s;ame term to the &s;ides of a door or of a window. Yet &s;o accu&s;tomed are we to definitions, that even the&s;e &s;imple ideas are not &s;uffered to e&s;cape. A &s;traight line, for example, is defined to be the &s;horte&s;t that can be
<PB N="125" REF="129">
drawn between two given points. The fact is certain; but &s;o far from a definition, that it is an inference drawn from the idea of a &s;traight line: and had I not beforehand a clear idea of a &s;traight line, I could not infer that it is the &s;horte&s;t be|tween two given points. D'Alembert &s;trains hard, but without &s;ucce&s;s, for a definition of a &s;traight line, and of the others mentioned. It is difficult to avoid &s;miling at his definition of paral|lel lines. Draw, &s;ays he, a &s;traight line: erect upon it two perpendiculars of the &s;ame length: upon their two extremities draw another &s;traight line; and that line is &s;aid to be parallel to the fir&s;t mentioned: as if, to under&s;tand what is meant by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>two parallel lines,</HI> we mu&s;t fir&s;t under&s;tand what is meant by a &s;traight line, by a perpendicular, and by two lines equal in length. A very &s;light reflection upon the ope|rations of his own mind, would have taught this author, that he could form the idea of parallel lines without running through &s;o many intermedi|ate &s;teps: &s;ight alone is &s;ufficient to explain the term to a boy, and even to a girl. At any rate, where is the nece&s;&s;ity of introducing the line la&s;t mentioned? If the idea of parallels cannot be ob|tained from the two perpendiculars alone, the ad|ditional line drawn through their extremities will certainly not make it more clear.</P>
<P>Mathematical figures being in their nature com|plex, are capable of being defined; and from the foregoing &s;imple ideas, it is ea&s;y to define every one of them. For example, a circle is a figure having a point within it, named the <HI>centre,</HI> through which all the &s;traight lines that can be drawn, and extended to the circumference, are equal; a &s;urface bounded by four equal &s;traight lines, and having four right angles, is termed a
<PB N="126" REF="130">
<HI>&s;quare;</HI> and a cube is a &s;olid, of which all the &s;ix &s;urfaces are &s;quares.</P>
<P>In the inve&s;tigation of mathematical truths, we a&s;&s;i&s;t the imagination, by drawing figures upon paper that re&s;emble our ideas. There is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity for a perfect re&s;emblance: a black &s;pot, which in reality is a &s;mall round &s;urface, &s;erves to repre&s;ent a mathematical point; and a black line, which in reality is a long narrow &s;urface, &s;erves to repre&s;ent a mathematical line. When we rea|&s;on about the figures compo&s;ed of &s;uch lines, it is &s;ufficient that the&s;e figures have &s;ome appearance of regularity: le&s;s or more is of no importance; becau&s;e our rea&s;oning is not founded upon them, but upon our ideas. Thus, to demon&s;trate that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, a triangle is drawn upon paper, in order to keep the mind &s;teady to its object, and to prevent wandering. After tracing the &s;teps that lead to the conclu&s;ion, we are &s;atisfied that the propo&s;ition is true; being con&s;cious that the rea&s;oning is built upon the ideal figure, not upon that which is drawn upon the paper. And being al&s;o con&s;cious that the enquiry is carried on inde|pendent of any particular length of the &s;ides, we are &s;atisfied of the univer&s;ality of the propo&s;ition, and of its being applicable to all triangles what|ever.</P>
<P>Numbers con&s;idered by them&s;elves, ab&s;tract|edly from things, make the &s;ubject of arithme|tic. And with re&s;pect both to mathematical and arithmetical rea&s;onings, which frequently con&s;i&s;t of many &s;teps, the proce&s;s is &s;hortened by the in|vention of &s;igns, which, by a &s;ingle da&s;h of the pen, expre&s;s clearly what would require many words. By that means, a very long chain of rea|&s;oning is expre&s;&s;ed by a few &s;ymbols; a method that contributes greatly to readine&s;s of compre|hen&s;ion.
<PB N="127" REF="131">
If in &s;uch rea&s;onings words were ne|ce&s;&s;ary, the mind, embarra&s;&s;ed with their multi|plicity, would have great difficulty to follow any long chain of rea&s;oning. A line drawn upon pa|per repre&s;ents an ideal line, and a few &s;imple characters repre&s;ent the ab&s;tract ideas of num|ber.</P>
<P>Arithmetical rea&s;oning, like mathematical, de|pends entirely upon the relation of equality, which can be a&s;certained with the greate&s;t cer|tainty among many ideas. Hence, rea&s;onings upon &s;uch ideas afford the highe&s;t degree of con|viction. I do not &s;ay, however, that this is al|ways the ca&s;e; for a man who is con&s;cious of his own fallibility, is &s;eldom without &s;ome de|gree of diffidence, where the rea&s;oning con&s;i&s;ts of many &s;teps. And though on a review no er|ror is di&s;covered, yet he is con&s;cious there may be errors, though they have e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>As to the other kind of demon&s;trative rea&s;on|ing, founded on &s;ome propo&s;ition of which we are intuitively certain; I ju&s;tly call it <HI>demon&s;tra|tive,</HI> becau&s;e it affords the &s;ame conviction that ari&s;es from mathematical rea&s;oning. In both, the means of conviction are the &s;ame, viz. a clear perception of the relation between two ideas: and there are many relations of which we have ideas no le&s;s clear than of equality; wit|ne&s;s &s;ub&s;tance and quality, the whole and its parts, cau&s;e and effect, and many others. From the intuitive propo&s;ition, for example, That no|thing which begins to exi&s;t can exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, I can conclude, that &s;ome one being mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from all eternity, with no le&s;s cer|tainty, than that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.</P>
<P>What falls next in order, is that inferior kind of knowledge which is termed <HI>opinion;</HI> and
<PB N="128" REF="132">
which, like knowledge properly &s;o termed, is founded in &s;ome in&s;tances upon intuition, and in &s;ome upon rea&s;oning. But it differs from knowledge in the following particular, that it produces different degrees of conviction, &s;ome|times approaching to certainty, and &s;ometimes &s;inking toward the verge of improbability. The con&s;tancy and uniformity of natural operations, is a fit &s;ubject for illu&s;trating that difference. The future &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes of day and night, of winter and &s;ummer, and of other &s;ucce&s;&s;ions which have hitherto been regular and uniform, fall under intuitive knowledge, becau&s;e of the&s;e we have the highe&s;t conviction. As the convic|tion is inferior of &s;ucce&s;&s;ions that hitherto have been varied in any degree, the&s;e fall under intui|tive opinion. We expect &s;ummer after winter with the utmo&s;t confidence; but we have not the &s;ame confidence in expecting a hot &s;ummer or a cold winter. And yet the probability approaches much nearer to certainty, than the intuitive opi|nion we have, that the operations of nature are extremely &s;imple, a propo&s;ition that is very little relied on.</P>
<P>As to opinion founded on rea&s;oning, it is ob|vious, that the conviction produced by the rea|&s;oning, can never ri&s;e above what is produced by the intuitive propo&s;ition upon which the rea|&s;oning is founded. And that it may be weaker, will appear from con&s;idering, that even where the fundamental propo&s;ition is certain, it may lead to the conclu&s;ive opinion by intermediate propo&s;itions, that are probable only, not certain. In a word, it holds in general with re&s;pect to every &s;ort of rea&s;oning, that the conclu&s;ive pro|po&s;ition can never ri&s;e higher in point of convic|tion, than the very lowe&s;t of the intuitive pro|po&s;itions employed as &s;teps in the rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="133">
The perception we have of the contingency of future events, opens a wide field to our rea&s;on|ing about probabilities. That perception involves more or le&s;s doubt according to its &s;ubject. In &s;ome in&s;tances, the event is perceived to be ex|tremely doubtful; in others it is perceived to be le&s;s doubtful. It appears altogether doubtful, in throwing a dye, which of the &s;ix &s;ides will turn up; and for that rea&s;on, we cannot ju&s;tly con|clude for one rather than another. If one only of the &s;ix &s;ides be marked with a figure, we con|clude, that a blank will turn up; and five to one is an equal wager that &s;uch will be the effect. In judging of the future behaviour of a man who has hitherto been governed by intere&s;t, we may conclude with a probability approaching to cer|tainty, that intere&s;t will continue to prevail.</P>
<P>Belief comes la&s;t in order, which, as defined above, is knowledge of the truth of facts that falls below certainty, and involves in its nature &s;ome degree of doubt. It is al&s;o of two kinds; one founded upon intuition, and one upon rea|&s;oning. Thus, knowledge, opinion, belief, are all of them equally di&s;tingui&s;hable into intuitive and di&s;cur&s;ive. Of intuitive belief, I di&s;cover three different &s;ources or cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, A pre&s;ent ob|ject. Secondly, An object formerly pre&s;ent. Third|ly, The te&s;timony of others.</P>
<P>To have a clear conception of the fir&s;t cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that among the &s;imple per|ceptions that compo&s;e the complex perception of a pre&s;ent object, a perception of real and pre&s;ent exi&s;tence is one. This perception ri&s;es common|ly to certainty; in which ca&s;e it is a branch of knowledge properly &s;o termed; and is handled as &s;uch above. But this perception falls below certainty in &s;ome in&s;tances; as when an object, &s;een at a great di&s;tance, or in a fog, is perceived
<PB N="130" REF="134">
to be a hor&s;e, but &s;o indi&s;tinctly as to make it a probability only. The perception in &s;uch a ca&s;e is termed <HI>belief.</HI> Both perceptions are fundamen|tally of the &s;ame nature; being &s;imple percepti|ons of real exi&s;tence. They differ only in point of accuracy: the perception of reality that makes a branch of knowledge, is &s;o clear and di&s;tinct as to exclude all doubt or he&s;itation: the perception of reality that occa&s;ions belief, being le&s;s clear and di&s;tinct, makes not the exi&s;tence of the object certain to us, but only probable.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd cau&s;e; the ex|i&s;tence of an ab&s;ent object, formerly &s;een, amounts not to a certainty; and therefore is the &s;ubject of belief only, not of knowledge. Things are in a continual flux from production to di&s;&s;olu|tion; and our &s;en&s;es are accommodated to that variable &s;cene: a pre&s;ent object admits no doubt of its exi&s;tence; but after it is removed, its ex|&s;tence becomes le&s;s certain, and in time &s;inks down to a &s;light degree of probability.</P>
<P>Human te&s;timony, the third cau&s;e, produces belief, more or le&s;s &s;trong, according to circum|&s;tances. In general, nature leads us to rely upon the veracity of each other; and commonly the degree of reliance is proportioned to the degree of veracity. Sometimes belief approaches to cer|tainty, as when it is founded on the evidence of per&s;ons above all exception. Sometimes it &s;inks to the lowe&s;t degree of probability, as when a fact is told by one who has no great reputation for truth. The nature of the fact, common or uncommon, has likewi&s;e an influence: an ordinary incident gains credit upon very &s;light evidence; but it re|quires the &s;tronge&s;t evidence to overcome the im|probability of an event that deviates from the or|dinary cour&s;e of nature. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that belief is not always found|ed
<PB N="131" REF="135">
upon rational principles. There are bia&s;&s;es and weakne&s;&s;es in human nature that &s;ometimes di&s;turb the operation, and produce belief without &s;ufficient or proper evidence: we are di&s;po&s;ed to believe on every &s;light evidence, an intere&s;ting event, however rare or &s;ingular, that alarms and agitates the mind; becau&s;e the mind, in agitati|on is remarkably &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions: for which rea&s;on, &s;tories of gho&s;ts and apparitions pa&s;s current with the vulgar. Eloquence al&s;o has great power over the mind; and, by making deep impre&s;&s;ions, enforces the belief of facts upon evi|dence that would not be regarded in a cool mo|ment.</P>
<P>The dependence that our perception of real exi&s;tence, and con&s;equently belief, hath upon oral evidence, enlivens &s;ocial intercour&s;e, and promotes &s;ociety. But the perception of real exi&s;tence has a &s;till more exten&s;ive influence; for from that perception is derived a great part of the entertainment we find in hi&s;tory, and in hi&s;tori|cal fables<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, ch. 2. part 1. &sect; 7.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, a perception that may be rai&s;ed by fiction as well as by truth, would often mi&s;lead, were we abandoned to its impul&s;e: but the God of nature hath provided a remedy for that evil, by erecting within the mind a tribunal, to which there lies an appeal from the ra&s;h impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;e. When the delu&s;ion of eloquence or of dread &s;ub&s;ides, the perplexed mind is uncertain what to believe. A regular proce&s;s commences, coun&s;el is heard, evidence produced, and a final judgment pronounced, &s;ometimes confirming, &s;ometimes varying, the belief impre&s;&s;ed upon us by the lively perception
<PB N="132" REF="136">
of reality. Thus, by a wi&s;e appointment of nature, intuitive belief is &s;ubjected to rational di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: when confirmed by rea&s;on, it turns more vigorous and authoritative: when contra|dicted by rea&s;on, it di&s;appears among &s;en&s;ible people. In &s;ome in&s;tances, it is too head&s;trong for rea&s;on; as in the ca&s;e of hobgoblins and ap|paritions, which pa&s;s current among the vulgar in &s;pite of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>We proceed to the other kind of belief, viz. that which is founded on rea&s;oning, to which, when intuition fails us, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e for a&s;certaining certain facts. Thus, from known effects, we infer the exi&s;tence of unknown cau&s;es. That an effect mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, is an intuitive propo&s;ition; but to a&s;certain what par|ticular thing is the cau&s;e, requires commonly a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning. This is one of the means by which the Deity, the primary cau&s;e, is made known to us, as mentioned above. Rea&s;on, in tracing cau&s;es from known effects, produces dif|ferent degrees of conviction. It &s;ometimes pro|duces certainty, as in proving the exi&s;tence of the Deity; which on that account is handled above, under the head of knowledge. For the mo&s;t part it produces belief only, which, according to the &s;trength of the rea&s;oning, &s;ometimes approaches to certainty, and &s;ometimes is &s;o weak as barely to turn the &s;cale on the &s;ide of probability. Take the following examples of different degrees of belief founded on probable rea&s;oning. When Inigo Jones flouri&s;hed, and was the only architect of note in England, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that his model of the Palace of Whitehall had been pre|&s;ented to a &s;tranger, without mentioning the author. The &s;tranger, in the fir&s;t place, would have been intuitively certain, that this was the work of &s;ome being intelligent and &s;kilful. Se|condly,
<PB N="133" REF="137">
He would have had a conviction ap|proaching to certainty, that the operator was a man. And, thirdly, He would have had a con|viction that the man was Inigo Jones; but le&s;s firm than the former. Let us next &s;uppo&s;e another Engli&s;h architect little inferior in reputa|tion to Jones: the &s;tranger would &s;till have pro|nounced in favour of the latter; but his belief would have been in the lowe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>When we inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of certain ef|fects, the rea&s;oning is often founded upon the known nature of man. In the high country, for example, between Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow, the people lay their coals at the end of their hou&s;es, without any fence to &s;ecure them from theft: whence it is rationally inferred, that coals are there in plenty. In the we&s;t of Scotland, the corn-&s;tacks are covered with great care and nicety: whence it is inferred, that the climate is rainy. Placentia is the capital town of Bi&s;cay; and the only town in Newfoundland bears the &s;ame name; from which circum&s;tance it is con|jectured, that the Bi&s;cayners were the fir&s;t Europeans who made a &s;ettlement in that i&s;land.</P>
<P>Analogical rea&s;oning, founded upon the unifor|mity of nature, is frequently employed in the in|ve&s;tigation of facts; and we infer, that facts of which we are uncertain, mu&s;t re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind that are known. The bulk of the rea&s;onings in natural philo&s;ophy are of that kind. Take the following examples. We learn from experience, that proceeding from the humble&s;t vegetable to man, there are numberle&s;s cla&s;&s;es of beings ri&s;ing one above another, by differences &s;carce perceptible, and leaving no where a &s;ingle gap or interval: and from conviction of the uni|formity of nature, we infer, that the line is not
<PB N="134" REF="138">
broken off here, but is carried on in the other worlds, till it end in the Deity. I proceed to another example. Every man is con&s;cious of a &s;elf-motive power in him&s;elf; and from the uni|formity of nature, we infer the &s;ame power in every one of our own &s;pecies. The argument here from analogy carries great weight, becau&s;e we entertain no doubt of the uniformity of nature with re&s;pect to beings of our own kind. We apply the &s;ame argument to other animals, though their re&s;emblance to man appears not &s;o certain, as that of one man to another. But why not al&s;o apply the &s;ame argument to infer a &s;elf-motive power in matter? When we &s;ee mat|ter in motion without an external mover, we naturally infer, that, like us, it moves it&s;elf. Another example is borrowed from Maupertuis. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As there is no known &s;pace of the earth co|vered with water &s;o large as the <HI>Terra Au&s;tra|lis incognita,</HI> we may rea&s;onably infer, that &s;o great a part of the earth is not altogether &s;ea, but that there mu&s;t be &s;ome proportion of land."</Q> The uniformity of nature with re&s;pect to the intermixture of &s;ea and land, is an argu|ment that affords but a very &s;lender degree of conviction. The following argument of the &s;ame kind, though it cannot be much relied on, &s;eems however better founded. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The inhabitants of the northern hemi&s;phere, have, in arts and &s;ciences, excelled &s;uch of the &s;outhern as we have any knowledge of: and therefore, if in|habitants be found in the <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis incognita,</HI> we ought not to expect among them many arts, nor much cultivation."</Q></P>
<P>After a fatiguing inve&s;tigation of numberle&s;s particulars which divide and &s;catter the thought, it may not be unplea&s;ant to bring all under one view by a &s;uccinct recapitulation.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="139">
We have two means for di&s;covering truth, and acquiring knowledge, viz. intuition and rea&s;oning. By intuition we di&s;cover &s;ubjects, and their at|tributes, pa&s;&s;ions, internal action, and in &s;hort every thing that is matter of fact. By intuition we al&s;o di&s;cover &s;everal relations. There are &s;ome facts, and many relations, that cannot be di&s;co|vered by a &s;ingle act of intuition, but require &s;everal &s;uch acts linked together in a chain of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Knowledge acquired by intuition, includes for the mo&s;t part certainty: in &s;ome in&s;tances it includes probability only. Knowledge acquired by rea&s;oning, frequently includes certainty; but more frequently includes probability only.</P>
<P>Probable knowledge, whether founded on in|tuition or on rea&s;oning, is termed <HI>opinion</HI> when it concerns relations; and is termed <HI>belief</HI> when it concerns facts. When knowledge includes cer|tainty, it retains its proper name.</P>
<P>Rea&s;oning that produces certainty, is termed <HI>demon&s;trative;</HI> and is termed <HI>probable,</HI> when it only produces probability.</P>
<P>Demon&s;trative rea&s;oning is of two kinds. The fir&s;t is, where the conclu&s;ion is derived from the nature and inherent properties of the &s;ubject: mathematical rea&s;oning is of that kind; and per|haps the only in&s;tance. The &s;econd is, where the conclu&s;ion is derived from &s;ome propo&s;ition, of which we are certain by intuition.</P>
<P>Probable rea&s;oning is endle&s;s in its varieties; and affords different degrees of conviction, de|pending on the nature of the &s;ubject upon which it is employed.</P>

<P>A PROGRESS from infancy to maturity in the mind of man, &s;imilar to that in his body, has been often mentioned. The external &s;en&s;es, being early nece&s;&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, arrive quickly at maturity. The internal &s;en&s;es are of a &s;lower growth, as well as every other mental power: their maturity would be of little or no u&s;e while the body is weak, and unfit for action. Rea&s;oning, as ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t &s;ec|tion, requires two mental powers, viz. the pow|er of invention, and that of perceiving relations. By the former power are di&s;covered intermediate propo&s;itions, equally related to the fundamental propo&s;ition and to the conclu&s;ion; and that rela|tion is verified by the latter power. Both pow|ers are nece&s;&s;ary to the per&s;on who frames an ar|gument, or a chain of rea&s;oning: the latter only to the per&s;on who judges of it. Savages are mi|&s;erably deficient in both. With re&s;pect to the former, a &s;avage may have a pregnant talent for
<PB N="137" REF="141">
invention; but it will &s;tand him in little &s;tead without a &s;tock of ideas enabling him to &s;elect what may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; and what oppor|tunity has a &s;avage to acquire &s;uch a &s;tock? With re&s;pect to the latter, he knows little of relations: and how &s;hould he know, when both &s;tudy and practice are nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;tingui&s;hing between relations, and for preventing the being impo&s;ed on by the &s;hadow of a relation in&s;tead of the &s;ub|&s;tance? The under&s;tanding, at the &s;ame time, among the illiterate, is ob&s;equious to pa&s;&s;ion and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and among them the imagina|tion acts without control, forming conclu&s;ions often no better than mere dreams. In &s;hort, con&s;idering the many cau&s;es that mi&s;lead from ju&s;t rea&s;oning, in days e&s;pecially of ignorance, the erroneous and ab&s;urd opinions that have pre|vailed in the world, and that continue in &s;ome mea&s;ure to prevail, are far from being &s;urpri&s;ing. Were rea&s;on our only guide in the conduct of life, we &s;hould have cau&s;e to complain; but our Maker has provided us with the moral &s;en&s;e, a guide little &s;ubject to error in matters of impor|tance. In the &s;ciences, rea&s;on is e&s;&s;ential; but in the conduct of life, which is our chief concern, rea&s;on may be an u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant; but to be our director is not its province.</P>
<P>The national progre&s;s of rea&s;on has been &s;low|er in Europe, than that of any other art. Statu|ary, painting, architecture, and other fine arts, approach nearer perfection, as well as morality and natural hi&s;tory. Manners, it is true, and every art that appears externally, may in part be acquired by imitation and example: in rea&s;oning there is nothing external to be laid hold of. But there is be&s;ide a particular cau&s;e that regards Eu|rope, which is the blind deference that for many
<PB N="138" REF="142">
ages was paid to Ari&s;totle; who has kept the rea|&s;oning faculty in chains more than two thou&s;and years. In his logics, the plain and &s;imple mode of rea&s;oning is rejected, that which Nature dic|tates; and in its &s;tead is introduced an artificial mode, &s;howy but un&s;ub&s;tantial: it is of no u&s;e in di&s;covering truth, but nobly contrived for wrang|ling and di&s;putation. Con&s;idering that rea&s;on for &s;o many ages has been locked up in the enchanted ca&s;tle of &s;yllogi&s;m, where empty phantoms pa&s;s for realities, the &s;low progre&s;s of rea&s;on toward maturity is far from being &s;urpri&s;ing. The ta|king of Con&s;tantinople, ann. 1453, opened a new &s;cene, which in time relieved the world from the u&s;urpation of Ari&s;totle, and re&s;tored rea&s;on to her privileges. All the knowledge of Europe was centered in Con&s;tantinople; and the learned men of that city, abhorring the Turks and their government, took refuge in Italy. The Greek language was introduced among the we&s;tern nati|ons of Europe; and the &s;tudy of Greek and Roman cla&s;&s;ics became fa&s;hionable. Men, hav|ing acquired new ideas, began to think for them&s;elves: they exerted their native faculty of rea&s;on: the futility of Ari&s;totle's logics became apparent to the penetrating; and is now appa|rent to all. Yet &s;o late as the year 1621, &s;eve|ral per&s;ons were bani&s;hed from Paris for contra|dicting that philo&s;opher, about matter and form, and about the number of the elements. And &s;hortly after, the parliament of Paris prohibited, under pain of death, any thing to be thought contrary to the doctrines of Ari&s;totle. Julius II. and Leo X. Roman Pontiffs, contributed zea|lou&s;ly to the reformation of letters; but they did not fore&s;ee that they were al&s;o contributing to the reformation of religion, and of every &s;cience that depends on rea&s;oning. Tho' the fetters of &s;yl|logi&s;m
<PB N="139" REF="143">
have many years ago been &s;haken off, yet, like a limb long kept from motion, the rea&s;oning faculty has &s;carcely to this day attained its free and natural exerci&s;e. Mathematics is the only &s;cience that never has been cramped by &s;yllogi&s;m, and we find rea&s;oning there in great perfection at an early period. The very &s;low progre&s;s of rea|&s;oning in other matters, will appear from the fol|lowing induction.</P>
<P>To exemplify erroneous and ab&s;urd rea&s;onings of every &s;ort, would be endle&s;s. The reader, I pre&s;ume, will be &s;atisfied with a few in&s;tances; and I &s;hall endeavour to &s;elect what are amu&s;ing. For the &s;ake of order, I divide them into three heads. Fir&s;t, In&s;tances &s;howing the imbecility of human rea&s;on during its nonage. Second, Er|roneous rea&s;oning occa&s;ioned by natural bia&s;&s;es. Third, Erroneous rea&s;oning occa&s;ioned by acqui|red bia&s;&s;es. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, in&s;tances are endle&s;s of rea&s;onings founded on erroneous premi&s;&s;es. It was an Epicurean doctrine, That the gods have all of them a human figure; moved by the following argument, that no being of any other figure has the u&s;e of rea&s;on. Plato, taking for granted the following erroneous propo&s;ition, That every being which moves it&s;elf, mu&s;t have a &s;oul, concludes that the world mu&s;t have a &s;oul, becau&s;e it moves it&s;elf<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cicero, De natura Deorum, lib. 2. &sect; 12.</NOTE>. Ari&s;totle taking it for granted, without the lea&s;t evidence, and con|trary to truth, that all heavy bodies tend to the centre of the univer&s;e, proves the earth to be the centre of the univer&s;e by the following argument. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heavy bodies naturally tend to the centre of the univer&s;e; we know by experience that heavy bodies tend to the centre of the earth: therefore the centre of the earth is the centre

of the univer&s;e."</Q> Appion ridicules the Jews for adhering &s;o literally to the precept of re&s;ting on their &s;abbath, as to &s;uffer Jeru&s;alem to be ta|ken that day by Ptolomy &s;on of Lagus. Mark the an&s;wer of Jo&s;ephus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever pa&s;&s;es a &s;o|ber judgment on this matter, will find our practice agreeable to honour and virtue; for what can be more honourable and virtuous, than to po&s;tpone our country, and even life it|&s;elf, to the &s;ervice of God, and of his holy re|ligion?"</Q> A &s;trange idea of religion, to put it in direct oppo&s;ition to every moral principle! A &s;uper&s;titious and ab&s;urd doctrine, That God will interpo&s;e by a miracle, to declare what is right in every matter of controver&s;y, has occa&s;ioned much erroneous rea&s;oning and ab&s;urd practice. The practice of determining controver&s;ies by &s;ingle combat, commenced about the &s;eventh century, when religion had degenerated into &s;uper&s;tition, and courage was e&s;teemed the only moral virtue. The parliament of Paris, in the reign of Charles VI. appointed a &s;ingle combat between two gen|tlemen, in order to have the judgment of God, whether the one had committed a rape on the other's wife. In 1454, John Picard being ac|cu&s;ed by his &s;on-in-law for too great familiarity with his wife, a duel between them was appoint|ed by the &s;ame parliament. Voltaire ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, that the parliament decreed a parricide to be committed, in order to try an accu&s;ation of ince&s;t, which po&s;&s;ibly was not committed. The trials by water and by fire, re&s;t on the &s;ame er|roneous foundation. In the former, if the per|&s;on accu&s;ed &s;unk to the bottom, it was a judg|ment pronounced by God, that he was innocent: if he kept above, it was a judgment that he was
<PB N="141" REF="145">
guilty. Fleury<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire Eccle&s;ia&s;tique.</NOTE> remarks, that if ever the per|&s;on accu&s;ed was found guilty, it was his own fault. In Sicily, a woman accu&s;ed of adultery, was compelled to &s;wear to her innocence: the oath, taken down in writing, was laid on water; and if it did not &s;ink, the woman was innocent. We find the &s;ame practice in Japan, and in Ma|labar. One of the articles in&s;i&s;ted on by the re|formers in Scotland, was, That public prayers be made and the &s;acraments admini&s;tered in the vul|gar tongue. The an&s;wer of a provincial council was in the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That to conceive public prayers, or admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, in any language but Latin, is contrary to the traditions and practice of the Catholic church for many ages pa&s;t; and that the demand can|not be granted, without impiety to God, and di&s;obedience to the church."</Q> Here it is ta|ken for granted, that the practice of the church is always right: which is building an argument on a very rotten foundation. The Caribbeans ab|&s;tain from &s;wines fle&s;h; taking it erroneou&s;ly for granted, that &s;uch food would make them have &s;mall eyes, held by them a great deformity. They al&s;o ab&s;tain from eating turtle; which they think would infect them with the lazine&s;s and &s;tupidity of that animal. Upon the &s;ame errone|ous notion, the Bra&s;ilians ab&s;tain from the fle&s;h of ducks, and of every creature that moves &s;lowly.</P>
<P>A talent for writing &s;eems in Germany to be e&s;timated by weight, as beauty is &s;aid to be in Holland. Cocceius, for writing three weighty folio volumes on law, has obtained among his countrymen the epithet of <HI>Great.</HI> This author, handling the rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in land-e&s;tates, has with mo&s;t profound erudition founded all of
<PB N="142" REF="146">
them upon a very &s;imple propo&s;ition, viz. That in a competition, that de&s;cendent is intitled to be preferred who has the greate&s;t quantity of the predece&s;&s;or's blood in his veins. <HI>Quaeritur,</HI> has a man any of his predece&s;&s;or's blood in his veins, otherwi&s;e than metaphorically? Strange! to build an argument in law upon a pure metaphor.</P>
<P>Next of rea&s;onings where the conclu&s;ion fol|lows not from the premi&s;&s;es, or fundamental pro|po&s;ition. Plato endeavours to prove, that the world is endowed with wi&s;dom, by the following argument. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The world is greater than any of its parts: therefore it is endowed with wi&s;|dom; for otherwi&s;e a man who is endowed with wi&s;dom would be greater than the world<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cicero, De natura Deorum, lib. 2. &sect; 12.</NOTE>."</Q> The conclu&s;ion here does not follow; for tho' a man is endowed with wi&s;dom it follows not, that he is greater than the world in point of &s;ize. Zeno endeavours to prove, that the world has the u&s;e of rea&s;on, by an argument of the &s;ame kind. Pope Gregory, writing in favour of the four councils, viz. Nice, Con&s;tantinople, Ephe|&s;us, and Calcedon, rea&s;ons thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as there are four evangeli&s;ts, there ought al&s;o to be four councils."</Q> What would he have &s;aid, if he had lived 100 years later, when there were many more than four? In admini&s;tering the &s;a|crament of the Lord's &s;upper, it was ordered, that the ho&s;t &s;hould be covered with a clean linen cloth; becau&s;e, &s;ays the Canon law, the body of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was buried in a clean linen cloth. Jo&s;ephus, in his an&s;wer to Appion, urges the following argument for the temple of Jeru&s;a|lem: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As there is but one God, and one world, it holds in analogy, that there &s;hould be but one temple."</Q> At that rate, there
<PB N="143" REF="147">
&s;hould be but one wor&s;hipper. And why &s;hould that one temple be at Jeru&s;alem rather than at Rome or at Pekin? The Syrians and Greeks did not for a long time eat fi&s;h. Two rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned: one is, That fi&s;h is not &s;acrificed to the gods; the other, That being immer&s;ed in the &s;ea, they look not up to heaven<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sir John Mar&s;ham, p. 221.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t would afford a more plau&s;ible argument for ea|ting fi&s;h. And if the other have any weight, it would be an argument for &s;acrificing men, and neither fi&s;h nor cattle. In ju&s;tification of the Salic law, which prohibits female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it was long held a conclu&s;ive argument, That in the &s;cripture the lilies are &s;aid neither to work nor to &s;pin. Vieira, termed by his countrymen <HI>the Lu&s;itanian Cicero,</HI> publi&s;hed &s;ermons, one of which begins thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were the Supreme Being to &s;how him&s;elf vi&s;ibly, he would chu&s;e the circle rather than the triangle, the &s;quare, the pentagon, the duodecagon, or any other fi|gure."</Q> But why appear in any of the&s;e fi|gures? And if he were obliged to appear in &s;o mean a &s;hape, a globe is undoubtedly more beau|tiful than a circle. Peter Hantz of Horn, who lived in the la&s;t century, imagined that Noah's ark is the true con&s;truction of a &s;hip; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is the workman&s;hip of God, and therefore perfect;"</Q> as if a ve&s;&s;el made merely for floating on the water, were the be&s;t al&s;o for &s;ailing. Sixty or &s;eventy years ago, the fa&s;hion prevailed, in imitation of birds, to &s;wallow &s;mall &s;tones for the &s;ake of dige&s;tion; as if what is proper for birds, were equally proper for men. The Spaniards, who laid wa&s;te a great part of the We&s;t Indies, endeavoured to excu&s;e their cruelties, by maintaining, that the natives were
<PB N="144" REF="148">
not men, but a &s;pecies of the Ouran Outang; for no better rea&s;on, than that they were of a copper colour, &s;poke an unknown language, and had no beard. The Pope i&s;&s;ued a bull, decla|ring, that it plea&s;ed him and the Holy Gho&s;t to acknowledge the Americans to be of the human race. This bull was not received cordially. In the council of Lima, ann. 1583, it was violent|ly di&s;puted, whether the Americans had &s;o much under&s;tanding as to be admitted to the &s;acraments of the church. In 1440, the Portugue&s;e &s;oli|cited the Pope's permi&s;&s;ion to double the Cape of Good hope, and to reduce to perpetual &s;ervitude the negroes, becau&s;e they had the colour of the damned, and never went to church. In the Fre|derician Code, a propo&s;ition is laid down, That by the law of nature no man can make a te&s;ta|ment. And in &s;upport of that propo&s;ition the fol|lowing argument is urged, which is &s;aid to be a demon&s;tration: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No deed can be a te&s;tament while a man is alive, becau&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;a|rily his <HI>ultima voluntas;</HI> and no man can make a te&s;tament after his death."</Q> Both premi&s;&s;es are true, but the negative conclu&s;ion does not fol|low. It is true a man's deed is not his <HI>ultima vo|luntas,</HI> while he is alive: but does it not become his <HI>ultima voluntas,</HI> when he dies without alte|ring the deed?</P>
<P>Many rea&s;onings have pa&s;&s;ed current in the world as good coin, where premi&s;&s;es and con|clu&s;ion are both of them fal&s;e. Ari&s;totle, who wrote a book upon mechanics, was much puz|zled about the equilibrium of a balance, when unequal weights are hung upon it at different di&s;|tances from the centre. Having ob&s;erved, that the arms of the balance de&s;cribe portions of a cir|cle, he accounted for the equilibrium by a nota|ble argument: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All the properties of the circle
<PB N="145" REF="149">
are wonderful: the equilibrium of the two weights that de&s;cribe portions of a circle is wonderful. <HI>Ergo,</HI> the equilibrium mu&s;t be one of the properties of the circle."</Q> What are we to think of Ari&s;totle's logics, when we find him capable of &s;uch childi&s;h rea&s;oning? And yet that work has been the admiration of all the world for centuries upon centuries. Nay, that fooli&s;h argument has been e&s;pou&s;ed and commen|ted upon by his di&s;ciples, for the &s;ame length of time. To proceed to another in&s;tance: Marri|age within the fourth degree of con&s;anguinity, as well as of affinity, is prohibited by the Lateran council; and the rea&s;on given is, That the body being made up of the four elements, has four dif|ferent humours in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original is curious: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quaternarius enim numerus bene congruit prohibitioui conjugii corpo|ralis; de quo dicit Apo&s;tolus, Quod vir non habet pote&s;tatem &s;ui corporis, &s;ed mulier; neque mulie: habet pote&s;tatem &s;ui corporis, &s;ed vir; quia quatu|or &s;unt humores in corpore, quod con&s;tat ex quatuo: elementis."</Q> Were men who could be guilty of &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, qualified to be our leaders in the mo&s;t impor|tant of all concerns, that of eternal &s;alvation?</NOTE>. The Roman Catholics began with beheading heretics, hanging them, or &s;toning them to death. But &s;uch puni&s;hments were di&s;covered to be too &s;light, in matters of faith. It was demon&s;trated, that heretics ought to be burnt in a &s;low fire: it was taken for grant|ed, that God puni&s;hes them in the other world with a &s;low fire; and hence it was inferred, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as every prince and every magi&s;trate is the image of God in this world, they ought to follow his example."</Q> Here is a double error in rea&s;oning: fir&s;t the taking for granted the fun|damental

propo&s;ition, which is &s;urely not &s;elf-evi|dent; and next the drawing a conclu&s;ion from it without any connection.</P>
<P>It once was a general opinion among tho&s;e who dwelt near the &s;ea, that people never die but du|ring the ebb of the tide. And there were not wanting plau&s;ible rea&s;ons. The &s;ea, in flowing, carries with it vivifying particles that recruit the &s;ick. The &s;ea is &s;alt, and &s;alt pre&s;erves from rottenne&s;s. When the &s;ea &s;inks in ebbing, every thing &s;inks with it: nature langui&s;hes: the &s;ick are not vivified: they die.</P>
<P>What &s;hall be &s;aid of a rea&s;oning where the conclu&s;ion is a flat contradiction to the premi&s;&s;es? If a man &s;hooting at a wild pigeon happen unfor|tunately to kill his neighbour, it is in the Engli&s;h law excu&s;able homicide; becau&s;e the &s;hooting an animal that is no man's property is a lawful act. If the aim be at a tame fowl for amu&s;ement, which is a tre&s;pa&s;s on the property of another, the death of the man will be man&s;laughter. If the tame fowl be &s;hot at in order to be &s;tolen, it will be murder, by rea&s;on of the felonious intent. From this la&s;t the following con&s;equence is drawn, that if a man, endeavouring to kill another, mi&s;&s;es his blow, and happeneth to kill him&s;elf, he is in judgment of law guilty <HI>of wilful and delibe|rate &s;elf-murder</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hale, Pleas of the Crown, cap. 1. 413.</NOTE>. Strange rea&s;oning! to con|&s;true an act to be wilful and deliberate &s;elf-murder, contrary to the very thing that is &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>A plentiful &s;ource of inconclu&s;ive rea&s;oning which prevails greatly during the infancy of the rational faculty, is the making of no proper di&s;|tinction between &s;trong and weak relations. Mi|nutius

Felix, in his apology for the Chri&s;tians, en|deavours to prove the unity of the Deity from a mo&s;t di&s;tant analogy or relation, viz. That there is but one king of the bees, and that more than one chief magi&s;trate would breed confu&s;ion. It is a pro&s;titution of rea&s;on to offer &s;uch an argument for the unity of the Deity. But any argument pa&s;&s;es current, in &s;upport of a propo&s;ition that we know beforehand to be true. Plutarch &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it &s;eemed to have happened by the pecu|liar direction of the gods, that Numa was born on the 21&s;t of April, the very day in which Rome was founded by Romulus;"</Q> a ve|ry childi&s;h inference from a mere accident. Sup|po&s;ing Italy to have been tolerably populous, as undoubtedly it was at that period, the 21&s;t of April, or any day of April, might have given birth to thou&s;ands. In many countries, the &s;ur|geons and barbers are cla&s;&s;ed together, as mem|bers of the &s;ame trade, from a very &s;light relati|on, that both of them operate upon the human body. The Jews enjoyed the reputation for cen|turies, of being &s;kilful phy&s;icians. Francis I. of France, having long laboured under a di&s;ea&s;e that eluded the art of his own phy&s;icians, applied to the Emperor Charles V. for a Jewi&s;h phy&s;ician from Spain. Finding that the per&s;on &s;ent had been converted to Chri&s;tianity, the King refu&s;ed to employ him; as if a Jew were to lo&s;e his &s;kill upon being converted to Chri&s;tianity. Why did not the King order one of his own phy&s;icians to be converted to Judai&s;m? The following childi&s;h argument is built upon an extreme &s;light relation, that between our Saviour, and the wooden cro&s;s he &s;uffered on. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Believe me,"</Q> &s;ays Julius Fir|micus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the devil omits nothing to de&s;troy mi&s;erable mortals; converting him&s;elf into every different form, and employing every &s;ort

of artifice. He appoints wood to be u&s;ed in &s;a|crificing to him, knowing that our Saviour, fix|ed to the cro&s;s, would be&s;tow immortality upon all his followers. A pine-tree is cut down, and u&s;ed in &s;acrificing to the mother of the gods. A wooden image of O&s;iris is buried in &s;acrificing to I&s;is. A wooden image of Pro&s;erpina is bemoaned for forty nights, and then thrown into the flames. Deluded mortals, the&s;e flames can do you no &s;ervice. On the contrary, the fire that is de&s;tined for your puni&s;hment rages without end. Learn from me to know that divine wood which will &s;et you free. A wooden ark &s;aved the human race from the univer&s;al deluge. Abraham put wood upon the &s;houlders of his &s;on I&s;aac. The wooden rod &s;tretched out by Aaron brought the chil|dren of I&s;rael out of the land of Egypt. Wood &s;weetened the bitter waters of Marah, and comforted the children of I&s;rael after wandering three days without water. A wooden rod &s;truck water out of the rock. The rod of God in the hand of Mo&s;es overcame Amalek. The patriarch dreamed, that he &s;aw angels de|&s;cending and a&s;cending upon a wooden ladder: and the law of God was inclo&s;ed in a wooden ark. The&s;e things were exhibited, that, as if it were by certain &s;teps, we might a&s;cend to the wood of the cro&s;s, which is our &s;alvation. The wood of the cro&s;s &s;u&s;tains the heavenly ma|chine, &s;upports the foundations of the earth, and leads men to eternal life. The wood of the devil burns and peri&s;hes, and its a&s;hes car|ries down &s;inners to the lowe&s;t pit of hell."</Q> The very &s;lighte&s;t relations make an impre&s;&s;ion on a weak under&s;tanding. It was a fancy of Antoninus Geta, in ordering his table, to have &s;ervices compo&s;ed of di&s;hes beginning with the
<PB N="149" REF="153">
&s;ame letter; &s;uch as lamb and lob&s;ter; broth, beef, blood-pudding; pork, plumb-cake, pige|ons, potatoes. The name of John, King of Scot|land, was changed into <HI>Robert,</HI> for no better rea&s;on, than that the Johns of France and of England had been unfortunate.</P>
<P>In rea&s;oning, in&s;tances are not rare, or mi&s;|taking the cau&s;e for the effect, and the effect for the cau&s;e. When a &s;tone is thrown from the hand, the continuance of its motion in the air, was once univer&s;ally accounted for as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the air follows the &s;tone at the heels, and pu&s;hes it on."</Q> The effect here is mi&s;taken for the cau&s;e: the air indeed follows the &s;tone at the heels; but it only fills the vacuity made by the &s;tone, and does not pu&s;h it on. It has been &s;lyly urged again&s;t the art of phy&s;ic, that phy&s;i|cians are rare among temperate people, &s;uch as have no wants but tho&s;e of nature; and that where phy&s;icians abound, di&s;ea&s;es abound. This is mi&s;taking the cau&s;e for the effect, and the effect for the cau&s;e: people in health have no occa&s;ion for a phy&s;ician; but indolence and luxury beget di&s;ea&s;es, and di&s;ea&s;es beget phy&s;ici|ans.</P>
<P>During the nonage of rea&s;on, men are &s;atisfied with words merely, in&s;tead of an argument. A &s;ea-pro&s;pect bounded is charming; but we &s;oon tire of an unbounded pro&s;pect. It would not give &s;atisfaction to &s;ay, that it is too exten|&s;ive; for why &s;hould not a pro&s;pect be reli&s;hed, however exten&s;ive? But employ a foreign term and &s;ay, that it is <HI>trop va&s;te,</HI> we enquire no far|ther: a term that is not familiar, makes an im|pre&s;&s;ion, and captivates weak rea&s;on. This ob|&s;ervation accounts for a mode of writing formerly in common u&s;e, that of &s;tuffing our language with Latin words and phra&s;es. The&s;e are now
<PB N="150" REF="154">
laid a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e a proper empha&s;is in reading, makes an impre&s;&s;ion deeper than any foreign term can do.</P>
<P>There is one proof of the imbecility of hu|man rea&s;on in dark times, which would &s;carce be believed, were not the fact &s;upported by incon|te&s;tible evidence. In&s;tead of explaining any natural appearance by &s;earching for a cau&s;e, it has been common to account for it by inventing a fable, which gave &s;atisfaction without enquiring farther. For example, in&s;tead of giving the true cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of day and night, the &s;a|cred book of the Scandinavians, termed <HI>Edda,</HI> accounts for that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by a tale: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The giant Nor had a daughter named <HI>Night,</HI> of a dark complexion. She was wedded to Dag|lingar, of the family of the gods. They had a male child, which they named <HI>Day,</HI> beau|tiful and &s;hining like all of his father's family. The univer&s;al father took Night and Day, placed them in heaven, and gave them two hor&s;es and two cars, that they might travel round the world, the one after the other. Night goes fir&s;t upon her hor&s;e named <HI>Rimfaxe,</HI> [Fro&s;ty Mane], who moi&s;tens the earth with the foam that drops from his bit, which is the dew. The hor&s;e belonging to Day is named <HI>Skinfaxe,</HI> [Shining Mane], who by his radiant mane illuminates the air and the earth."</Q> It is ob&s;erved by the tran&s;lator of the Edda, that this way of accounting for things is well &s;uited to the turn of the human mind, which is endowed with curio&s;ity that is extremely keen, but ea&s;ily &s;ati&s;|fied, often with words in&s;tead of ideas. Zo|roa&s;ter, by a &s;imilar fable, accounts for the growth of evil in this world. He invents a good and an evil principle named <HI>Oromazes</HI> and <HI>Arimanes,</HI> who are in continual conflict for preference. At
<PB N="151" REF="155">
the la&s;t day, Oromazes will be reunited to the &s;upreme God, from whom he i&s;&s;ued. Arimanes will be &s;ubdued, darkne&s;s de&s;troyed; and the world, purified by an univer&s;al conflagration, will become a luminous and &s;hining abode, from which evil will be excluded. I return to the Edda, which is &s;tored with fables of this kind. The highe&s;t notion &s;avages can form of the gods, is that of men endowed with extraordinary power and knowledge. The only puzzling circum&s;tance is, how they differ &s;o much from man as to be immortal. The Edda accounts for this by the fol|lowing fable. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The gods prevented the effect of old age and decay, by continuing to eat cer|tain apples, tru&s;ted to the care of <HI>Iduna. Loke,</HI> the Momus of the Scandinavians, craf|tily conveyed away <HI>Iduna,</HI> and concealed her in a wood, under the cu&s;tody of a giant. The gods beginning to wax old and gray, detected the author of the theft; and, by terrible me|naces, compelled him to employ his utmo&s;t cunning, for regaining Iduna and her apples, in which he was &s;ucce&s;sful."</Q> The origin of poetry is thus accounted for in the &s;ame work: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The gods formed <HI>Cua&s;er,</HI> who traver&s;ed the earth, teaching wi&s;dom to men. He was treacherou&s;ly &s;lain by two dwarfs, who, mix|ing honey with his blood, compo&s;ed a liquor that renders all who drink of it poets. The&s;e dwarfs having incurred the re&s;entment of a cer|tain giant, were expo&s;ed by him upon a rock, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with the &s;ea. They gave for their ran&s;om the &s;aid liquor, which the giant delivered to his daughter <HI>Gunloda.</HI> The precious potion was eagerly &s;ought for by the gods; but how were they to come at it? <HI>Odin,</HI> in the &s;hape of a worm crept through a crevice into the cavern where the liquor was
<PB N="152" REF="156">
concealed. Then re&s;uming his natural &s;hape, and obtaining Gunloda's con&s;ent to take three draughts, he &s;ucked up the whole; and, tran&s;|forming him&s;elf into an eagle, flew away to <HI>A&s;gard.</HI> The giant, who was a magician, flew with all &s;peed after Odin, and came up with him near the gate of <HI>A&s;gard.</HI> The gods i&s;&s;ued out of their palaces to a&s;&s;i&s;t their ma|&s;ter; and pre&s;ented to him all the pitchers they could lay hands on, which he in&s;tantly filled with the precious liquor. But in the hurry of di&s;charging his load, Odin poured only part of the liquor through his beak, the re&s;t being emitted through a le&s;s pure vent. The former is be&s;towed by the gods upon good poets, to in&s;pire them with divine enthu&s;ia&s;m. The latter, which is in much greater plenty, is be&s;towed liberally on all who apply for it; by which means the world is pe&s;tered with an endle&s;s quantity of wretched ver&s;es."</Q> Igno|rance is equally credulous in all ages. Albert, &s;urnamed <HI>the Great,</HI> flouri&s;hed in the thirteenth century, and was a man of real knowledge. Du|ring the cour&s;e of his education he was remarkably dull; and &s;ome years before he died became a &s;ort of changeling. That &s;ingularity produced the following hi&s;tory: That the only Virgin, ap|pearing to him, demanded, whether he would excel in philo&s;ophy or in theology; that upon his chu&s;ing the former, &s;he promi&s;ed, that he &s;hould become an incomparable philo&s;opher; but added, that to puni&s;h him for not prefer|ring theology, he &s;hould become &s;tupid again as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;light view, it may appear unaccounta|ble, that even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages &s;hould take a childi&s;h tale for a &s;olid rea&s;on. But nature aids the deception: where things are related in a lively

Can an ignorant ru&s;tic doubt of in&s;piration, when he &s;ees as it were the poet &s;ipping the pure cele&s;tial liquor? And how can that poet fail to produce bad ver&s;es, who feeds on the excrements that drop from the fundament even of a deity?</P>
<P>In accounting for natural appearances, even good writers have betrayed a weakne&s;s in rea&s;on|ing, little inferior to that above mentioned. They do not indeed put off their di&s;ciples with a tale; but they put them off with a mere &s;uppo&s;i|tion, not more real than the tale. De&s;cartes a&s;cribes the motion of the planets to a vortex of ether whirling round and round. He thought not of enquiring whether there really be &s;uch a vor|tex, nor what makes it move. M. Buffon forms the earth out of a &s;plinter of the &s;un, &s;truck off by a comet. May not one be permitted humbly to enquire of that eminent philo&s;opher, what form|ed the comet? This pa&s;&s;es for &s;olid rea&s;oning; and yet we laugh at the poor Indian, who &s;up|ports the earth from falling by an elephant, and the elephant by a tortoi&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;till more ridiculous to rea&s;on upon what is acknowledged to be a fiction, as if it were real. Such are the fictions admitted in the Roman law. A Roman taken captive in war, lo&s;t his privilege of being a Roman citizen; for freedom was held e&s;&s;ential to that privilege. But what if he made his e&s;cape, after perhaps an hour's detention? The hard&s;hip in that ca&s;e ought to have &s;ugge&s;ted an alteration of the law, which was, to &s;u&s;pend the privilege no longer than the captivity &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed. But the ancient Romans were not &s;o ingeni|ous.
<PB N="154" REF="158">
They remedied the hard&s;hip by a fiction, that the man never had been a captive. The Fre|derician code bani&s;hes from the law of Pru&s;&s;ia an endle&s;s number of fictions that are found in the Roman law (Preface, &s;ect. 28.). Yet after|ward, treating of per&s;onal rights, it is laid down as a rule, That a child in the womb is feigned or &s;uppo&s;ed to be born when the fiction is for its advantage (part 1. b. 1. tit. 4. &s;ect. 4.). To a weak rea&s;oner a fiction is a happy contrivance for re&s;olving intricate que&s;tions. Such is the con&s;ti|tution of England, that the Engli&s;h law-courts are merely territorial; and that no fact happening abroad comes under their cogni&s;ance. An En|gli&s;hman, after murdering his fellow-traveller in France, returns to his native country. What is to be done? for guilt ought not to pa&s;s unpuni&s;h|ed. The crime is feigned to have been commit|ted in England.</P>
<P>Ancient hi&s;tories are full of incredible facts that pa&s;&s;ed current during the infancy of rea&s;on, which at pre&s;ent would be rejected with contempt. Every man who is conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of ancient nations, can recall in&s;tances without end. Does any one believe at pre&s;ent, tho' gravely re|ported by hi&s;torians, that in old Rome there was a law, for cutting into pieces the body of a bank|rupt, and di&s;tributing the parts among his credi|tors? The &s;tory of Por&s;enna and Scevola is high|ly romantic; and the Story of Vampires in Hun|gary, &s;hamefully ab&s;urd. There is no rea&s;on to believe, that there ever was &s;uch a &s;tate as that of the Amazons; and the &s;tory of Thale&s;tris and Alexander the Great is undoubtedly a fiction. Scotch hi&s;torians de&s;cribe gravely and circum&s;tan|tially the battle of Luncarty, as if they had been eye-witne&s;&s;es. A country-man and his two &s;ons, it is &s;aid, were ploughing in an adjacent field,
<PB N="155" REF="159">
during the heat of the action. Enraged at their countrymen for turning their backs, they broke the plough in pieces; and each laying hold of a part, ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the battle, and ob|tained a complete victory over the Danes. This &s;tory has every mark of fiction: A man follow|ing unconcernedly his ordinary occupation of ploughing, in &s;ight of a battle, on which depend|ed his wife and children, his goods, and perhaps his own life. More, Three men, without rank of figure, with only a &s;tick in the hand of each, &s;temming the tide of victory, and turning the fate of battle. I mention not that a plough was unknown in Scotland for a century or two after that battle; for that circum&s;tance could not create a doubt in the hi&s;torian, if he was ignorant of it.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, with re&s;pect to its progre&s;s, is &s;ingu|lar. Morals, manners, and every thing that ap|pears externally, may in part be acquired by imi|tation and example, which have not the &s;lighte&s;t influence upon the rea&s;oning faculty. The only means for advancing that faculty to maturity, are indefatigable &s;tudy and practice; and even the&s;e will not carry a man one &s;tep beyond the &s;ubjects he is conver&s;ant about: examples are not rare of men extremely expert in one &s;cience, and gro&s;&s;|ly deficient in others. Many able mathematicians are novices in politics, and even in the common arts of life: &s;tudy and practice have ripened them in every relation of equality, while they re|main ignorant, like the vulgar, about other rela|tions.

I proceed to the &s;econd article, containing er|roneous rea&s;oning occa&s;ioned by natural bia&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t bias I &s;hall mention has an exten&s;ive in|fluence. What is &s;een, makes a deeper impre&s;|&s;ion, than what is heard by report, or di&s;covered by reflection. Hence it is, that in judging of right and wrong, the external act only draws the attention of the ignorant and illiterate, who can|not penetrate into will or intention; and hence it is, that in religion great weight is laid upon forms and ceremonies, without much regarding their purpo&s;e. The&s;e particulars come in afterward, in the progre&s;s of morality and religion. What belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ketch is to ob&s;erve, that in judging of covenants, laws, vows, and other acts that are completed by words, the whole weight in days of ignorance is laid upon the ex|ternal expre&s;&s;ion, with no regard to the meaning of the &s;peaker or writer. The ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed by I&s;aac upon his &s;on Jacob, mi&s;taking him for E&s;au, is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance. Not only was the ble&s;&s;ing intended for E&s;au, but Jacob, by de|ceiving his father, had rendered him&s;elf unwor|thy of it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, chap. 27.</NOTE>; yet I&s;aae had pronounced the &s;ounds, and it was not in his power to un&s;ay

Led by the &s;ame bias, people think it &s;ufficient to fulfil the words of a vow, however &s;hort of intention. The Duke of Lanca&s;ter, vexed at the ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance of Rennes, a town in Britany, vowed in wrath not to rai&s;e the &s;iege till he had planted the Engli&s;h colours upon one of the gates. This proved a ra&s;h vow. He found it nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the &s;iege, but his vow &s;tood in the way. The governor relieved him from his &s;cruple, per|mitting him to plant his colours upon one of the gates; and he was &s;atisfied that his vow was ful|filled. The following is an example of an ab|&s;urd conclu&s;ion deduced from a precept taken li|terally, again&s;t common &s;en&s;e. We are ordered by the Apo&s;tle, to pray always; from which Je|rom, one of the fathers, argues thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Conju|gal enjoyment is incon&s;i&s;tent with praying; <HI>ergo,</HI> conjugal enjoyment is a &s;in."</Q> By the &s;ame argument it may be proved, that eating and drinking are &s;ins; and that &s;leeping is a great &s;in, being a great interruption to praying. With re|&s;pect to another text, viz. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, the hu&s;band of one wife,"</Q> taken literally, a very different conclu&s;ion is drawn in Aby&s;&s;inia, viz. That no man can be or|dained a pre&s;byter till he be married. Prohibiti|ons have been interpreted in the &s;ame &s;hallow manner. Clarendon gives two in&s;tances, both of them relative to the great fire of London. The mayor propo&s;ing to pull down a hou&s;e in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of the fire, was oppo&s;ed by the lawyers, who declared the act to be unlawful; and the hou&s;e was burnt without being pul|led

down. About the &s;ame time it was propo&s;ed to break open &s;ome hou&s;es in the Temple for &s;av|ing the furniture, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors being in the country; but it was declared burglary to force open the door without con&s;ent of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Such literal interpretation, contrary to common &s;en&s;e, has been extended even to inflict puni&s;h|ment. I&s;adas was bathing when the alarm was given in Lacedemon, that Epaminondas was at hand with a numerous army. Naked as he was, he ru&s;hed again&s;t the enemy with a &s;pear in one hand and a &s;word in the other, bearing down all before him. The Ephori fined him for going to battle unarmed: but honoured him with a gar|land for his gallant behaviour. How ab&s;urd to think, that the law was intended for &s;uch a ca&s;e! and how much more ab&s;ured to think, that the &s;ame act ought to be both puni&s;hed and rewarded! The King of Ca&s;tile being carried  off his hor&s;e by a hunted hart, was &s;aved by a per&s;on at hand, who cut his belt. The judges thought a pardon ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to relieve from capital pu|ni&s;hment a man who had lifted a &s;word again&s;t his &s;overeign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A per&s;on unacquainted with the hi&s;tory of law, will imagine that Swift has carried beyond all bounds his &s;atire again&s;t lawyers, in &s;aying, that Gulliver had incurred a capital puni&s;hment, for &s;aving the Empe|ror's palace by pi&s;&s;ing out the fire; it being capital in any per&s;on of what quality &s;oever, to make water with|in the precincts of the palace.</NOTE>.

in that &s;hape a criminal proce&s;s went on again&s;t him. Could it &s;eriou&s;ly be thought, that a rot|ten carca&s;e brought into court was &s;ufficient to fulfil the law? The &s;ame ab&s;urd farce was play|ed in Scotland, upon the body of Logan of Re&s;|talrig, &s;everal years after his interment. The body of Tancred King of Sicily was rai&s;ed from the grave, and the head cut off for &s;uppo&s;ed re|bellion. Henry IV. of Ca&s;tile was depo&s;ed in his ab&s;ence; but, for a colour of ju&s;tice, the following ridiculous &s;cene was acted. A wooden &s;tatue dre&s;&s;ed in a royal habit, was placed on a theatre; and the &s;entence of depo&s;ition was &s;olemnly read to it, as if it had been the King him&s;elf. The Archbi&s;hop of Toledo &s;eized the crown, another the &s;ceptre, a third the &s;word; and the ceremo|ny was concluded with proclaiming another king. How humbling are &s;uch &s;cenes to man, who va|lues him&s;elf upon the faculty of rea&s;on as his prime attribute! An expedient of that kind would now be rejected with di&s;dain, as fit only to amu&s;e children; and yet it grives me to ob&s;erve that law-proceedings are not yet totally purged of &s;uch dro&s;s. By a law in Holland, the criminal's con|fe&s;&s;ion is e&s;&s;ential to a capital puni&s;hment, no meaner evidence being held &s;ufficient: and yet if he in&s;i&s;t on his innocence, he is tortured till he pronounce the words of confe&s;&s;ion; as if founds merely were &s;ufficient, without will or intention. The practice of England in a &s;imilar ca&s;e, is no le&s;s ab&s;urd. Confe&s;&s;ion is not there required; but it is required, that the per&s;on accu&s;ed &s;hould plead, and &s;ay whether he is innocent or guilty. But what if he &s;tand mute?

It &s;hows &s;trange weakne&s;s in the rational faculty, not to &s;ee, that &s;uch fore|knowledge would be a gift more pernicious to man than Pandora's box: it would deprive him of every motive to action; and leave no place for

&s;agacity, nor for contriving means to bring about a de&s;ired event.

<P>An appetite for things rare and wonderful, is a natural bias no le&s;s univer&s;al than the former.

This appetite di&s;plays it&s;elf even in childhood: &s;tories of gho&s;ts and apparitions are anxiou&s;ly li&s;tened to; and firmly believed, by means of the terror they oc|ca&s;ion: and the vulgar accordingly have been cap|tivated with &s;uch &s;tories, upon evidence that

But human belief is not left at the mercy of every irregular bias.

That reformation however has been exceedingly &s;low, becau&s;e the appetite is exceedingly &s;trong. Such ab|&s;urdities found credit among wi&s;e men, even as late as the la&s;t age. I am ready to verify the charge, by introducing two men of the fir&s;t rank for under&s;tanding: were a greater number nece&s;|&s;ary, there would be no difficulty of making a very bulky li&s;t. The celebrated Grotius &s;hall lead the van. Procopius, in his Vandal hi&s;tory, relates, that &s;ome orthodox Chri&s;tians, who&s;e tongues were cut out by the Arians, continued miraculou&s;ly to &s;peak as formerly. And to vouch the fact, he appeals to &s;ome of tho&s;e miraculous per&s;ons, alive in Con&s;tantinople at the time of his writing. In the dark ages of Chri&s;tianity, when different &s;ects were violently enflamed again&s;t each other, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that gro&s;s ab&s;ur|dities were &s;wallowed as real miracles: but is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, and equally mortifying, to find Grotius, the greate&s;t genius of the age he lived in, adopting &s;uch ab&s;urdities? For the truth of the foregoing miracle, he appeals not only to

Procopius, but to &s;everal writers<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prolegomena to his Hi&s;tory of the Goths.</NOTE>; as if the hear&s;ay of a few writers were &s;ufficient to make us believe an impo&s;&s;ibility.

<P>I proceed to our famous hi&s;torian, the Earl of Clarendon, the other per&s;on I had in view. A man long in public bu&s;ine&s;s, a con&s;ummate politi|cian, and well &s;tored with knowledge from books as well as from experience, might be fortified again&s;t fooli&s;h miracles, if any man can be forti|fied: and yet behold his &s;uper&s;titious credulity in childi&s;h &s;tories; no le&s;s weak in that particular, than was his cotemporary Grotius. He gravely relates an incident regarding the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Duke of Buckingham, the &s;um of which fol|lows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There were many &s;tories &s;cattered abroad at that time, of prophecies and pre|dictions of the Duke's untimely and violent death; one of which was upon a better foun|dation of credit, than u&s;ually &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es are founded upon. There was an officer in the King's wardrobe in Wind&s;or ca&s;tle, of reputa|tion for hone&s;ty and di&s;cretion, and at that time about the age of fifty. About &s;ix months before the mi&s;erable end of the Duke, this
<PB N="164" REF="168">
man being in bed, and in good health, there appeared to him at midnight a man of a vene|rable a&s;pect, who drawing the curtains, and fixing his eye upon him, &s;aid, Do you know me, Sir? The poor man, half dead with fear, an&s;wered, That he thought him to be Sir George Villiers, father to the Duke. Upon which he was ordered by the apparition, to go to the Duke, and tell him, that if he did not &s;omewhat to ingratiate him&s;elf with the peo|ple, he would be &s;uffered to live but a &s;hort time. The &s;ame per&s;on appeared to him a &s;econd and a third time, reproaching him bit|terly for not performing his promi&s;e. The poor man plucked up as much courage as to excu&s;e him&s;elf, that it was difficult to find ac|ce&s;s to the Duke, and that he would be thought a madman. The apparition imparted to him &s;ome &s;ecrets, which he &s;aid would be his cre|dentials to the Duke. The officer, introduced to the Duke by Sir Ralph Freeman, was re|ceived courteou&s;ly. They walked together near an hour; and the Duke &s;ometimes &s;poke with great commotion, though his &s;ervants, with Sir Ralph, were at &s;uch a di&s;tance that they could not hear a word. The officer, returning from the Duke, told Sir Ralph, that when he mentioned the particulars that were to gain him credit, the Duke's colour changed; and he &s;wore the officer could come to that knowledge only by the devil; for that the&s;e particulars were known only to him&s;elf, and to one per&s;on more, of who&s;e fidelity he was &s;e|cure. The Duke, who went to accompany the King at hunting, was ob&s;erved to ride all the morning in deep thought; and before the morning was &s;pent, left the field, and alighted
<PB N="165" REF="169">
at his mother's hou&s;e, with whom he was &s;hut up for two or three hours. When the Duke left her, his countenance appeared full of trouble, with a mixture of anger, which ne|ver appeared before in conver&s;ing with her: and &s;he was found overwhelmed with tears, and in great agony. Whatever there was of all this, it is a notorious truth, that when &s;he heard of the Duke's murder, &s;he &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, nor did expre&s;s much &s;orrow."</Q></P>
<P>The name of Lord Clarendon calls for more attention to the foregoing incident than otherwi&s;e it would de&s;erve. It is no article of the Chri&s;tian faith, that the dead pre&s;erve their connection with the living, or are ever &s;uffered to return to this world: we have no &s;olid evidence for &s;uch a fact; nor ever hear of it, except in tales for amu&s;ing or terrifying children. Secondly, The &s;tory is incon&s;i&s;tent with the cour&s;e of Providence, which, for the be&s;t purpo&s;es, has drawn an impe|netrable veil between us and futurity. Thirdly, This apparition, though &s;uppo&s;ed to be endowed with a miraculous knowledge of future events, is however deficient in the &s;agacity that belongs to a per&s;on of ordinary under&s;tanding. It appears twice to the officer, without thinking of giving him proper credentials; nor does it at all think of them till &s;ugge&s;ted by the officer. Fourthly, Why did not the apparition go directly to the Duke him&s;elf; where could be the nece&s;&s;ity of employing a third per&s;on? The Duke mu&s;t have been much more affected with an apparition to him&s;elf, than by hearing it at &s;econd hand. The officer was afraid of being taken for a madman; and the Duke had &s;ome rea&s;on to think him &s;uch. La&s;tly, The apparition happened above three
<PB N="166" REF="170">
months before the Duke's death; and yet we hear not of a &s;ingle &s;tep taken by him, in pur&s;u|ance of the advice given him. The authority of the hi&s;torian, and the regard we owe him, have drawn from me the foregoing reflections; which with re&s;pect to the &s;tory it&s;elf are very little ne|ce&s;&s;ary; for the evidence is really not &s;uch as to verify any ordinary occurrence. His Lord&s;hip acknowledges, that he had no evidence but com|mon report, &s;aying, that it was one of the many &s;tories &s;cattered about at that time. He does not &s;ay, that the &s;tory was related to him by the of|ficer, who&s;e name he does not even mention, or by Sir Ralph Freeman, or by the Duke's mother, or by the Duke him&s;elf. If ever any thing hap|pened like the &s;tory in que&s;tion, it may with good rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the officer was crazy, or enthu&s;ia&s;tically mad: nor have we any evidence beyond common report, that he communicated any &s;ecrets to the Duke. I &s;hall only add upon this article, that here are two remarkable in&s;tan|ces of an ob&s;ervation made above, that a man may be high in one &s;cience and very low in another. Had Grotius, or had Clarendon, &s;tudied the fundamentals of ra&s;on and religion coolly and impartially, as they did other &s;ciences, they would never have given faith to reports &s;o ill vouched, and &s;o contradictory to every &s;ound prin|ciple of theology.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of erroneous rea&s;oning is, a &s;ingular tendency in the mind of man to my&s;te|ries and hidden meanings. The bu&s;y mind is &s;el|dom &s;atisfied with the &s;imple and obvious intend|ment, where the object makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion: invention is rou&s;ed to allegorize, and to pierce into hidden views and purpo&s;es.

Jo&s;ephus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jewi&s;h Antiquities, book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, talking of the tabernacle, has the following pa&s;|&s;age. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let any man con&s;ider the &s;tructure of the tabernacle, the &s;acerdotal ve&s;tments, the ve&s;&s;els dedicated to the &s;ervice of the altar; and he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be convinced, that our lawgiver was a pious man, and that all the clamours again&s;t us and our profe&s;&s;ion, are mere calumny. For what are all of the&s;e but the image of the whole world? This will ap|pear to any man who &s;oberly and impartially examines the matter. The tabernacle of thir|ty cubits is divided into three parts; two for the prie&s;ts in general, and as free to them as the earth and the &s;ea; the third, where no mortal mu&s;t be admitted, is as the Heaven, re&s;erved for God him&s;elf. The twelve loaves of &s;hew-bread &s;ignify the twelve months of the year. The candle&s;tick, compo&s;ed of &s;e|ven branches, refers to the twelve &s;igns of the zodiac, through which the &s;even planets &s;hape their cour&s;e; and the &s;even lamps on the top of the &s;even branches bear an analogy to the planets them&s;elves.

nature of the univer&s;e, and the interweav|ing it with gold has a regard to the rays of light. The girdle about the body of the prie&s;t is as the &s;ea about the globe of the earth. The two &s;ardonyx &s;tones are a kind of figure of the &s;un and moon; and the twelve other &s;tones may be under&s;tood, either of the twelve months, or of the twelve &s;igns in the zodiac. The violet-coloured tiara is a re&s;emblance of heaven; and it would be irreverent to have written the &s;acred name of God upon any other colour. The triple crown and plate of gold give us to under&s;tand the glory and Ma|je&s;ty of Almighty God. This is a plain illu&s;|tration of the&s;e matters; and I would not lo&s;e any opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to the ho|nour and wi&s;dom of our incomparable Law|giver."</Q> How much wire-drawn, and how re|mote from any appearance of truth, are the fore|ing allu&s;ions and imagined re&s;emblances! But re|ligious forms and ceremonies, however arbitrary, are never held to be &s;o. If an u&s;eful purpo&s;e do not appear, it is taken for granted, that there mu&s;t be a hidden meaning; and any meaning, however childi&s;h, will &s;erve at a pinch. Such propen&s;ity there is in dark ages for allegorizing, that even our Saviour's miracles have not e&s;cap|ed.

Why &s;uch partiality to ancient ceremonies, when no hidden meaning is &s;uppo&s;ed in tho&s;e of Chri|&s;tians, &s;uch as bowing to the ea&s;t, or the prie&s;t performing the liturgy, partly in a black upper garment, partly in a white? No ideas are more &s;imple than of numbers, nor le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of any hidden meaning; and yet the profound Py|thagoras has imagined many &s;uch meanings. The number <HI>one,</HI> &s;ays he, having no parts, repre&s;ents the Deity: it repre&s;ents al&s;o order, peace, and tranquility, which re&s;ult from unity of &s;entiment.

He di&s;covered in the number <HI>three</HI> the mo&s;t &s;ublime my&s;teries: all things are com|po&s;ed, &s;ays he, of three &s;ub&s;tances. The num|ber <HI>four</HI> is holy in its nature, and con&s;titutes the divine e&s;&s;ence, which con&s;i&s;ts in unity, pow|er, benevolence, and wi&s;dom. Would one be|lieve, that the great philo&s;opher, who demon|&s;trated the 47th propo&s;ition of the fir&s;t book of Euclid, was the inventor of &s;uch childi&s;h con|ceits? Perhaps Pythagoras meant only to divert him&s;elf with them. Whether &s;o or not, it &s;eems difficult to be explained, how &s;uch trifles were pre&s;erved in memory, and handed down to us through &s;o many generations.

<P>The tendency in the mind of man to my&s;teries and allegories, di&s;plays it&s;elf with great vigour upon our forefathers, and upon the ancients in general, by means of the great veneration that is paid them. Before writing was known, ancient hi&s;tory is made up of traditional fables. A Tro|jan Brutus peopled England; and the Scots are de&s;cended from Scota, daughter to an Egyptian king. What rea&s;on have we to doubt but that the hi&s;tories of the heathen gods are equally involved
<PB N="171" REF="175">
in fable? We pretend not to draw any hidden meaning from the former: why &s;hould we &s;u&s;pect any &s;uch meaning in the latter? Allegory is a &s;pecies of writing too refined for a &s;avage or bar|barian: it is the fruit of a cultivated imagination; and was a late invention even in Greece. The allegories of E&s;op are of the &s;imple&s;t kind, and yet they were compo&s;ed after learning began to flouri&s;h; and Cebes, who&s;e allegory about the life of man is ju&s;tly celebrated, was a di&s;ciple of Socrates. Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion however in favour of the ancients makes us conclude, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome hidden meaning or allegory in their hi&s;tori|cal fables; for no better rea&s;on than that they are de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e. In the Greek my|thology, there are numberle&s;s fables related as hi&s;torical facts merely; witne&s;s the fable of gods mixing with women, and procreating giants, like what we find in the fabulous hi&s;tories of ma|ny other nations; the&s;e giants attempting to de|throne Jupiter; Apollo keeping the &s;heep of Ad|metus; Minerva &s;pringing from the head of Jove<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However ea&s;y it may be to draw an allegorical meaning out of that fable, I cannot admit any &s;uch meaning to have been intended. An allegory is a fable contrived to illu&s;trate &s;ome acknowledged truth, by making a deeper impre&s;&s;ion than the truth would make in plain words; of which we have &s;everal beautiful in|&s;tances in the Spectator (Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 20. &sect; 6.). But the fable here was under&s;tood to be a matter of fact, Minerva being wor&s;hipped by the Greeks as a real godde&s;s, the daughter of Jupiter without a mother.</NOTE>; Bacchus cut out of his thigh; Orpheus going to hell for his wife; Mars and Venus caught by Vulcan in a net; and a thou&s;and other &s;uch childi&s;h &s;tories. But the Greeks, many
<PB N="172" REF="176">
centuries after the invention of &s;uch fooli&s;h fables, becoming illu&s;trious for arts and &s;ciences, nothing would &s;atisfy writers in later times, but to dub them profound Philo&s;ophers even in their cradle, when mere &s;avages; and hence endle&s;s attempts to detect my&s;teries and hidden meanings in their fables. Let other interpreters of that kind pa&s;s; they give me no concern: but I cannot, without the deepe&s;t concern, behold our illu&s;trious philo|&s;opher Bacon employing his talents &s;o ab&s;urdly. What imbecility mu&s;t there be in human nature, when &s;o great a genius is capable of &s;uch puerili|ties! As a &s;ubject &s;o humbling is far from being agreeable, I confine my&s;elf to a few in&s;tances. In an ancient fable, Prometheus formed man out of clay; and kindling a bundle of birch rods at the chariot of the &s;un, brought down fire to the earth for the u&s;e of his creature man. And tho' un|grateful man complained to Jupiter of that theft, yet the god, plea&s;ed with the ingenuity of Pro|metheus, not only confirmed to man the u&s;e of fire, but conferred on him a gift much more con|&s;iderable: the gift was perpetual youth, which was laid upon an a&s;s to be carried to the earth. The a&s;s wanting to drink at a brook, was oppo|&s;ed by a &s;erpent, who in&s;i&s;ted to have the bur|den, without which, no drink for the poor a&s;s. And thus, for a draught of plain water, was per|petual youth transferred from man to the &s;erpent. This fable has a &s;triking re&s;emblance to many in the Edda; and, in the manner of the Edda, ac|counts for the invention of fire, and for the mor|tality of man. Nor is there in all the Edda one more childi&s;h, or more di&s;tant from any appear|ance of a rational meaning. It is handled however by our philo&s;opher, with much &s;olemn gravity, as if every &s;ource of wi&s;dom were locked up in it. The explanation he gives, being too long to be
<PB N="173" REF="177">
copied here, &s;hall be reduced to a few particu|lars. After an elogium upon fire, his Lord&s;hip proceeds thus. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The manner wherein Prome|theus &s;tole his fire, is properly de&s;cribed from the nature of the thing; he being &s;aid to have done it by applying a rod of birch to the chari|ot of the &s;un: for birch is u&s;ed in &s;triking and beating; which clearly denotes fire to proceed from violent percu&s;&s;ions and colli&s;ions of bo|dies, whereby the matters &s;truck are &s;ubtili|zed, rarefied, put into motion, and &s;o prepa|red to receive the heat of the cele&s;tial bodies. And accordingly they, in a clande&s;tine and &s;e|cret manner, &s;natch fire, as it were by &s;tealth, from the chariot of the &s;un."</Q> He goes on as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The next is a remarkable part of the fable; which repre&s;ents, that men, in&s;tead of gratitude, accu&s;ed both Prometheus and his fire to Jupiter: and yet the accu&s;ation proved &s;o plea&s;ant to Jupiter, that he not only indulged mankind the u&s;e of fire, but conferred upon them perpetual youth. Here it may &s;eem &s;trange, that the &s;in of ingratitude &s;hould meet with approbation or reward. But the allegory has another view; and denotes, that the accu|&s;ation both of human nature and human art, proceeds from a noble and laudable temper of mind, viz. mode&s;ty; and al&s;o tends to a very good purpo&s;e, viz. to &s;tir up fre&s;h indu&s;try and new di&s;coveries."</Q> Can any thing be more wire-drawn?</P>

Con&s;cious of that de|fect, he was the inventer of chariots; which
<PB N="174" REF="178">
&s;howed the graceful part of his body, and con|cealed what was deformed.

Yet, upon great &s;truggle and application, there proceed certain imperfect births, or lame abortive works; which however, with great pomp and deceitful appearances, are triumphantly carri|ed about, and &s;hown by impo&s;tors."</Q> I admit the ingenuity of that forced meaning; but had the inventer of that fable any latent meaning? If he had, why did he conceal it? The ingenious meaning would have merited prai&s;e; the fable it|&s;elf none at all.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add but one other in&s;tance, for they grow tire&s;ome. Sphinx was a mon&s;ter, having the face and voice of a virgin, the wings of a bird, and the talons of a gryphin. She re&s;id|ed on the &s;ummit of a mountain, near the city Thebes. Her manner was, to lie in ambu&s;h for travellers, to propo&s;e dark riddles which &s;he re|ceived from the Mu&s;es, and to tear tho&s;e to pieces who could not &s;olve them. The Thebans having offered their kingdom to the man who &s;hould in|terpret the&s;e riddles, Oedipus pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the mon&s;ter, and he was required to ex|plain the following riddle, viz. What creature is that, which being born four-footed, becomes af|terwards two-footed, then three-footed, and la&s;tly four-footed again. Oedipus an&s;wered, It was man, who in his infancy crawls upon his hands and feet, then walks upright upon his two feet, walks in old age with a &s;tick, and at la&s;t lies
<PB N="175" REF="179">
four-footed in bed. Oedipus having thus obtain|ed the victory, &s;lew the mon&s;ter; and laying the carca&s;e upon an a&s;s, carried it off in triumph. Now for the explanation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is an elegant and in&s;tructive fable, invented to repre&s;ent &s;cience: for Science may be called a mon&s;ter, being &s;trangely gazed at and admired by the ignorant.

Her voice and countenance are repre&s;ented female, by rea&s;on of her gay appearance, and volubility of &s;peech. Wings are added, becau&s;e the &s;ciences and their in|ventions fly about in a moment; for know|ledge, like light communicated from torch to torch, is pre&s;ently catched, and copiou&s;ly dif|fu&s;ed. Sharp and hooked talons are elegant|ly attributed to her; becau&s;e the axioms and arguments of &s;cience fix down the mind, and keep it from moving or &s;lipping away."</Q> A|gain: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All &s;cience &s;eems placed on high, as it were on the tops of mountains that are hard to climb; for &s;cience is ju&s;tly imagined a &s;ublime and lofty thing, looking down upon ignorance, and at the &s;ame time taking an exten&s;ive view on all &s;ides, as is u&s;ual on the tops of moun|tains.

<P>I will detain the reader but a moment longer, to hear what our author &s;ays in ju&s;tification of &s;uch my&s;terious meaning. Out of many rea&s;ons, I &s;elect the two following. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It may pa&s;s for a farther indication of a concealed and &s;ecret meaning, that &s;ome of the&s;e fables are &s;o ab|&s;urd and idle in their narration, as to proclaim an allegory even afar off. A fable that car|ries probability with it, may be &s;uppo&s;ed in|vented for plea&s;ure, or in imitation of hi&s;tory; but what could never be conceived or related in this way, mu&s;t &s;urely have a different u&s;e. For example, what a mon&s;trous fiction is this, That Jupiter &s;hould take <HI>Metis</HI> to wife; and as &s;oon as he found her pregnant eat her up; whereby he al&s;o conceived, and out of his head brought forth <HI>Pallas</HI> armed! Certainly no mortal could, but for the &s;ake of the moral it couches, invent &s;uch an ab&s;urd dream as this, &s;o much out of the road of thought."</Q> At that rate, the more ridiculous or ab&s;urd a fable is, the more in&s;tructive it mu&s;t be. This opinion re&s;embles that of the an|cient Germans with re&s;pect to mad women, who were held to be &s;o wi&s;e, as that every thing they uttered was prophetic. Did it never once occur to our author, that in the infancy of the rea&s;oning fa|culty, the imagination is &s;uffered to range without control, as in a dream; and that the vulgar in all
<PB N="177" REF="181">
ages are delighted with wonderful &s;tories; the more out of nature, the more to their ta&s;te?</P>
<P>We proceed to the other rea&s;on. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The ar|gument of mo&s;t weight with me is, That many of the&s;e fables appear not to have been invent|ed by the per&s;ons who relate and divulge them, whether Homer, He&s;iod, or others; for if I were a&s;&s;ured they fir&s;t flowed from tho&s;e later times and authors, I &s;hould never expect any thing &s;ingularly great or noble from &s;uch an origin. But whoever attentively con&s;iders the thing, will find, that the&s;e fables are delivered down by tho&s;e writers, not as matters then fir&s;t invented, but as received and embraced in ear|lier ages. And this principally rai&s;es my e&s;teem of tho&s;e fables; which I receive, not as the product of the age, or invention of the poets, but as &s;acred relics, gentle whi&s;pers, and the breath of better times, that from the traditions of more ancient nations, came at length into the flutes and trumpets of the Greeks."</Q> Was it our author's real opinion, that the farther back we trace the hi&s;tory of man, the more of &s;cience and knowledge is found; and con&s;equently that &s;avages are the mo&s;t learned of all men?</P>
<P>The following fable of the &s;avage Canadians ought to be my&s;terious, if either of the rea&s;ons urged above be conclu&s;ive. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There were in the beginning but &s;ix men in the world, (from whence &s;prung is not &s;aid): one of the&s;e a&s;|cended to heaven in que&s;t of a woman named <HI>Atahent&s;ic,</HI> and had carnal knowledge of her.

my&s;tery out of it, however little intended by the inventer of the fable. And if either ab&s;urdity or antiquity entitle fables to be held &s;acred relics, gentle whi&s;pers, and the breath of better times, the following Japane&s;e fables are well entitled to the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing epithets. <Q REND="inline">"Bun&s;io, in wed|lock, having had no children for many years, ad|dre&s;&s;ed her prayers to the gods, was heard, and was delivered of 500 eggs. Fearing that the eggs might produce mon&s;ters, &s;he packed them up in a box, and threw them into the river. An old fi&s;herman finding the box, hatched the eggs in an oven, every one of which produced a child. The children were fed with boiled rice and mug|wort-leaves; and being at la&s;t left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, they fell a robbing on the highway. Hearing of a man famous for great wealth, they told their &s;tory at his gate, and begged &s;ome food. This happening to be the hou&s;e of their mother, &s;he owned them for her children, and gave a great entertainment to her friends and neighbours.

revenged his father's death, killing the traitors with his own hand. Upon this &s;ignal victory, a lady of incomparable beauty appeared to him, and made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his heat, that he took her to wife. Abino Scimei, procreated of that marriage, was endowed with divine wi&s;dom, and with the precious gift of prophecy. Ja&s;&s;ima was ignorant that his wife was the very fox who&s;e life he had &s;aved, till &s;he re&s;umed by degrees her former &s;hape."</Q> If there be any hidden my&s;tery in this tale, I &s;hall not de&s;pair of finding a my|&s;tery in every fairy-tale invented by Madam Go|mez.</P>
<P>It is lamentable, how &s;lowly human under&s;tand|ing, and the faculty of rea&s;on, creep toward ma|turity. If this reflection be verified in our cele|brated philo&s;opher Bacon, how much more in the bulk of mankind? It is comfortable, however, that human under&s;tanding is in a progre&s;s toward maturity, however &s;low. The fancy of allegori|zing ancient fables, is now out of fa&s;hion: en|lightened rea&s;on has unma&s;ked the&s;e fables, and left them in their nakedne&s;s, as the invention of illiterate ages, when wonder was the prevail|ing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t two heads, I proceed to the third, viz. Erroneous rea&s;oning, occa&s;i|oned by acquired bia&s;&s;es. And one of the&s;e that has the greate&s;t influence in perverting the rati|onal faculty, is blind religious zeal. There is not in nature a &s;y&s;tem more &s;imple or per&s;picuous than that of pure religion; and yet what a com|po&s;ition hath it been rendered of metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilties, and unintelligible jargon! That &s;ubject being too well known to need illu&s;tration, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a few in&s;tances of the in|fluence that religious &s;uper&s;tition has on other &s;ub|jects.</P>

A hi&s;tory-painter and a player require the &s;ame &s;ort of genius. The one by colours, the other by looks and ge&s;tures, expre&s;&s;es various modifications of pa&s;&s;ion, even what are beyond the reach of words; and to accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, great &s;en&s;ibility is requi&s;ite, as well as judgment. Why then is not a player equally re&s;pected with a hi&s;tory-painter? It was thought by zealots, that a play is an entertainment too &s;plendid for a mortified Chri&s;tian; upon which account players fell under church-cen&s;ure, and were held unwor|thy of Chri&s;tian burial. A hi&s;tory-painter, on the contrary, being employed in painting for the church, was always in high e&s;teem. It is only among Prote&s;tants that players are beginning to be re&s;tored to their privileges as free citizens; and there perhaps never exi&s;ted a hi&s;tory-painter more ju&s;tly e&s;teemed, than Garrick, a player, is in Great Britain. Ari&s;tarchus having taught, that the earth moves round the &s;un, was accu&s;ed by the Heathen prie&s;ts, for troubling the repo&s;e of their hou&s;ehold-gods. Copernicus, for the &s;ame doctrine, was accu&s;ed by Chri&s;tian prie&s;ts, as contradicting the &s;criptures, which talk of the &s;un's moving. And Galileo, for adhering to Copernicus, was condemned to pri&s;on and pe|nance: he found it nece&s;&s;ary to recant upon his knees in a &s;olemn manner. A bias acquired from Ari&s;totle, kept rea&s;on in chains for centuries. Schola&s;tic divinity in particular, founded on the philo&s;ophy of that author, was more hurtful to the rea&s;oning faculty than the Goths and Huns. Tycho Brah&eacute; &s;uffered great per&s;ecution for main|taining, that the heavens were &s;o far empty of matter as to give free cour&s;e to the comets; con|trary to Ari&s;totle, who taught, that the heavens are harder than a diamond: it was extremely ill taken, that a &s;imple mortal &s;hould pretend to

<P>Rea&s;on is extremely apt to be warped by habit. In the di&s;putes among the Athenians, about ad|ju&s;ting the form of their government, it is ob|&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who lived in the high country were for democracy; that the inhabitants of the plains were for oligarchy; and the &s;eamen for monarchy. Shepherds are all equal: in a corn|country, there are a few ma&s;ters and many &s;er|vants: on &s;hipboard, there is one commander, and all the re&s;t &s;ubjects. Habit was their advi&s;er: none of them thought of con&s;ulting rea&s;on in or|der to judge what was the be&s;t form upon the whole. Habit of a different kind has an influence no le&s;s powerful. Per&s;ons who are in the habit of rea&s;oning, require demon&s;tration for every thing: even a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition is not &s;uf|fered to e&s;cape. The&s;e &s;uperfluous proofs occur more than once in the Elements of Euclid. Nor has Ari&s;totle, with all his &s;kill in logics, entirely avoided them. Can any thing be more &s;elf|evident, than the difference between plea&s;ure and motion? Yet Ari&s;totle attempts to demon|&s;trate, that they are different. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No motion,"</Q>

&s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"except circular motion, is perfect in any one point of time: there is always &s;ome|thing wanting during its cour&s;e, and it is not perfected till it arrive at its end.

Again, A body cannot be in a &s;ubject: every quality is in a &s;ubject; <HI>ergo,</HI> quality is not a body."</Q> But De&s;cartes affords the mo&s;t illu&s;trious in&s;tance of the kind. He was the greate&s;t geometer of the age he lived in, and one of the greate&s;t of any age; which in&s;en&s;ibly led him to overlook intuitive know|ledge, and to admit no propo&s;ition but what is demon&s;trated or proved in the regular form of &s;yllogi&s;m. He took a fancy to doubt even of his own exi&s;tence, till he was convinced of it by the following argument. <HI>Cogito, ergo &s;um: I think, therefore I exi&s;t.</HI> And what &s;ort of a demon&s;tra|tion is this after all? In the very fundamental propo&s;ition he acknowledges his exi&s;tence by the term <HI>I;</HI> and how ab&s;urd is it, to imagine a proof nece&s;&s;ary of what is admitted to be true in the fundamental propo&s;ition? In the next place, How does our author know that he thinks? If nothing is to be taken for granted, an argument is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to prove that he thinks, than to prove that he exi&s;ts. It is true, that he has intuitive knowledge of his thinking; but has he not the &s;ame of his exi&s;ting?

<P>In every &s;ubject of rea&s;oning, to define terms is nece&s;&s;ary in order to avoid mi&s;takes.

But, of all, the mo&s;t remarkable definition of motion is that of Ari&s;totle, famous for its impenetrability, or rather ab&s;urdity, viz. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Actus entis in potentia, quatenus in poten|tia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The action of a being in power, &s;o far as it is in power."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Exten&s;ion enters into the conception of every particle of matter; becau&s;e every particle of matter has length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. Fi|gure in the &s;ame manner enters into the concep|tion of every particle of matter; becau&s;e every particle of matter is bounded. By the power of ab&s;traction, figure may be conceived independent of the body that is figured; and exten&s;ion may be conceived independent of the body that is ex|tended. The&s;e particulars are abundantly plain and obvious; and yet ob&s;erve what a heap of jargon is employed by the followers of Leibnitz, in their fruitle&s;s endeavours to define exten&s;ion. In order to that end, they begin with <HI>&s;imple ex|i&s;tences,</HI> which they &s;ay are unextended, and
<PB N="185" REF="189">
without parts. According to that definition, &s;imple exi&s;tences cannot belong to matter, be|cau&s;e the &s;malle&s;t particle of matter has both parts and exten&s;ion.

<P>I clo&s;e with a curious &s;ort of rea&s;oning, &s;o &s;in|gular indeed as not to come under any of the fore|going heads. The fir&s;t editions of the late&s;t ver|&s;ion of the Bible into Engli&s;h have a preface, in which the tran&s;lators make the following apology for not keeping clo&s;e to the words of the original. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Another thing we think good to admoni&s;h thee of, gentle reader, that we have not tied our|&s;elves to an uniformity of phra&s;ing, or to an identity of words, as &s;ome peradventure would wi&s;h that we had done, becau&s;e they ob&s;erve, that &s;ome learned men &s;omewhere have been as exact as they could be that way. Truly, that we might not vary from the &s;en&s;e of that which we have tran&s;lated before, if the word

&s;ignified the &s;ame in both places, (for there be &s;ome words that be not of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e every where), we were e&s;pecially careful, and made a con&s;cience according to our duty. But that we &s;hould expre&s;s the &s;ame notion in the &s;ame particular word; as, for example, if we tran&s;late the Hebrew or Greek word once by <HI>purpo&s;e,</HI> never to call it <HI>intent;</HI> if one where <HI>journeying,</HI> never <HI>travelling;</HI> if one where <HI>think,</HI> never <HI>&s;uppo&s;e;</HI> if one where <HI>pain,</HI> never <HI>ache;</HI> if one where <HI>joy,</HI> never <HI>gladne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.; thus to mince the matter, we thought to favour more of curio&s;ity than wi&s;dom, and that rather it would breed &s;corn in the Athei&s;t, than bring profit to the godly reader. For is the king|dom of God become words or &s;yllables? Why &s;hould we be in bondage to them, if we may be free; u&s;e one preci&s;ely, when we may u&s;e another, no le&s;s fit, as commodiou&s;ly? We might al&s;o be charged by &s;coffers, with &s;ome unequal dealing toward a great number of good Engli&s;h words. For as it is written by a cer|tain great philo&s;opher, that he &s;hould &s;ay, that tho&s;e logs were happy that were made images to be wor&s;hipped; for their fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: &s;o if we &s;hould &s;ay, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have a place in the Bible always; and to others of like quality, Get ye hence, be bani&s;hed for ever, we might be taxed peradventure with St. James his words, namely, to be partial in our&s;elves, and judges of evil thoughts."</Q> <HI>Quaeritur,</HI> Can this tran&s;lation be &s;afely relied on, as the rule of faith, when &s;uch are the tran&s;la|tors?</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="introduction">
<P>IN reviewing the foregoing &s;ketch, it occurred that a fair analy&s;is of Ari&s;totle's logics, would be a valuable addition to the hi&s;torical branch. A di&s;|tinct and candid account of a &s;y&s;tem that for many ages governed the rea&s;oning part of man|kind, cannot but be acceptable to the public. Curio&s;ity will be gratified, in &s;eeing a phantom delineated, that &s;o long fa&s;cinated the learned world; a phantom, which, like the pyramids of Egypt, or hanging gardens of Babylon, is a &s;tructure of infinite genius, but ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s for rai&s;ing wonder. Dr. Reid, profe&s;&s;or of moral philo&s;ophy in the college of Gla&s;gow, reli&s;hed the thought; and his friend|&s;hip to me prevailed on him, after much &s;olli|citation, to undertake the laborious ta&s;k. No man is better acquainted with Ari&s;totle's writ|ings; and, without any enthu&s;ia&s;tic attach|ment, he holds that philo&s;opher to be a fir&s;t|rate genius.</P>
<P>The logics of Ari&s;totle have been on the decline more than a century; and are at pre&s;ent relegated to &s;chools and colleges. They have occa&s;ionally been critici&s;ed by different writers; but this is the fir&s;t attempt to draw them out of their ob&s;curity into day-light. By what follows, one will be enabled to pa&s;s a
<PB N="188" REF="192">
true judgment on them, and to determine, whether they ought, or ought not, to make a branch of education. The Doctor's e&s;&s;ay, as a capital article in the progre&s;s and hi&s;tory of the &s;ciences, will, I hope, be made welcome, even with the fatigue of &s;queezing through many thorny paths, before a proper view can be obtained of that ancient and &s;tupendous fabric.</P>
<P>It will at the &s;ame time &s;hew the hurt that Ari&s;totle has done to the rea&s;oning faculty, by drawing it out of its natural cour&s;e into devious paths. His artificial mode of rea&s;oning, is no le&s;s &s;uperficial than intricate. I &s;ay, &s;uperfi|cial; for in none of his logical works, is a &s;ingle truth attempted to be proved by &s;yllo|gi&s;m that requires a proof: the propo&s;itions he undertakes to prove by &s;yllogi&s;m, are all of them &s;elf evident. Take for in&s;tance the fol|lowing propo&s;ition, That man has a power of &s;elf-motion. To prove this, he a&s;&s;umes the following axiom, upon which indeed every one of his &s;yllogi&s;ms are founded, viz. That whatever is true of a number of particulars joined together, holds true of every one &s;epa|rately; which is thus expre&s;&s;ed in logical terms, Whatever is true of the genus, holds true of every &s;pecies. Founding upon that axiom, he rea&s;ons thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All animals have a power of &s;elf-motion: man is an animal: <HI>ergo,</HI> man has a power of &s;elf-motion."</Q> Now if all animals have a power of &s;elf-motion, it requires no argument to prove, that man, an animal, has that power: and therefore, what he gives as a conclu&s;ion or con&s;equence, is not really &s;o; it is not <HI>inferred</HI> from the fundamental propo&s;ition, but is <HI>included</HI> in it. At the &s;ame time, the &s;elf-motive power of man, is a fact
<PB N="189" REF="193">
that cannot be known but from experience. I add, that the &s;elf-motive power of man, is more clearly a&s;certained by experience, than that of any other animal: and in attempting to prove man to be a &s;elf-motive animal, is it not ab&s;urd, to found the argument on a propo&s;i|tion le&s;s certain than that undertaken to be de|mon&s;trated? What is here ob&s;erved, will be found applicable to the bulk, if not the whole, of his &s;yllogi&s;ms.</P>
<P>It appears &s;ingular, that Ari&s;totle him&s;elf never attempts to apply his &s;yllogi&s;tic mode of rea&s;oning, to any &s;ubject handled by him: on ethics, on rhetoric, and on poetry, he argues like a rational being, without once putting in practice any of his own rules. But how is it po&s;&s;ible, that a man of his capacity could long remain ignorant, how in&s;ufficient a &s;yllogi&s;m is for di&s;covering any latent truth? He certainly intended his &s;y&s;tem of logics, chiefly, if not &s;olely, for di&s;putation: and if &s;uch was his purpo&s;e, he has been wonderfully &s;ucce&s;sful; for nothing can be better contrived than that &s;y&s;tem, for wrangling and di&s;puting without end. He indeed in a manner, profe&s;&s;es this to be his aim, in his books <HI>De Sophi&s;ticis elen|chis.</HI></P>
<P>Some ages hence, when the goodly fabric of the Romi&s;h &s;piritual power &s;hall be laid low in the du&s;t, and &s;carce a ve&s;tige remain, it will among antiquaries be a curious enquiry, What was the nature and extent of a tyranny, more oppre&s;&s;ive to the minds of men, than the tyran|ny of ancient Rome was to their per&s;ons? Dur|ing every &s;tep of the enquiry, po&s;terity will rejoice over mental liberty, no le&s;s precious in their eyes than per&s;onal liberty. The de&s;poti&s;m of Ari&s;totle with re&s;pect to the faculty of rea|&s;on,
<PB N="190" REF="194">
was no le&s;s complete, than that of the Bi&s;hop of Rome with re&s;pect to religion; and it has now become a proper &s;ubject of curio&s;ity, to enquire into the nature and extent of that de&s;poti&s;m, from which men are at la&s;t &s;et hap|pily free. One cannot peru&s;e the following &s;heets, without &s;ympathetic pain for the weak|ne&s;s of man with re&s;pect to his noble&s;t faculty; but that pain will redouble his &s;atisfaction, in now being left free to the dictates of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In my reveries, I have more than once com|pared Ari&s;totle's logics to a bubble made of &s;oap|water for amu&s;ing children; a beautiful figure with &s;plendid colours; fair on the out&s;ide, emp|ty within. It has for more than two thou&s;and years been the hard fate of Ari&s;totle's followers, Ixion like, to embrace a cloud for a godde&s;s.&mdash;But this is more than &s;ufficient for a preface: and I had almo&s;t forgot, that I am detaining my readers from better entertainment, in li&s;tening to Dr. Reid.</P>

<P>ARISTOTLE had very uncommon advanta|ges: born in an age when the philo&s;ophical &s;pirit in Greece had long flouri&s;hed, and was in its greate&s;t vigour; brought up in the court of Macedon, where his father was the King's phy|&s;ician; twenty years a favourite &s;cholar of Plato, and tutor to Alexander the Great; who both honoured him with his friend&s;hip, and &s;upplied him with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of his enquiries.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages he improved by indefatiga|ble &s;tudy, and immen&s;e reading. He was the fir&s;t we know, &s;ays Strabo, who compo&s;ed a library. And in this the Egyptian and Pergame|nian kings, copied his example. As to his ge|nius,
<PB N="192" REF="196">
it would be di&s;re&s;pectful to mankind, not to allow an uncommon &s;hare to a man who governed the opinions of the mo&s;t enlightened part of the &s;pecies near two thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>If his talents had been laid out &s;olely for the di&s;covery of truth, and the good of mankind, his laurels would have remained for every fre&s;h: but he &s;eems to have had a greater pa&s;&s;ion for fame than for truth, and to have wanted rather to be admired as the prince of philo&s;ophers, than to be u&s;eful: &s;o that it is dubious whether there be in his character mo&s;t of the philo&s;opher, or of the &s;ophi&s;t. The opinion of Lord Bacon is not without probability, That his ambition was as boundle&s;s as that of his royal pupil, the one a&s;piring at univer&s;al monarchy over the bodies and fortunes of men, the other over their opini|ons. If this was the ca&s;e, it cannot be &s;aid, that the philo&s;opher pur&s;ued his aim with le&s;s indu&s;|try, le&s;s ability, or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s, than the hero.</P>
<P>His writings carry too evident marks of that philo&s;ophical pride, vanity, and envy, which have often &s;ullied the character of the learned. He determines boldly things above all human knowledge; and enters upon the mo&s;t difficult que&s;tions, as his pupil entered on a battle, with full a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. He delivers his deci|&s;ions oracularly, and without any fear of mi&s;take. Rather than confe&s;s his ignorance, he hides it under hard words and ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, of which his interpreters can make what plea&s;es them. There is even rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he wrote often with affected ob&s;curity, either that the air of my&s;tery might procure greater veneration, or that his books might be under|&s;tood only by the adepts who had been initiated in his philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="197">
His conduct towards the writers that went be|fore him has been much cen&s;ured. After the manner of the Ottoman princes, &s;ays Lord Veru|lam, he thought his throne could not be &s;ecure unle&s;s he killed all his brethren. Ludovicus Vives charges him with detracting from all philo&s;ophers, that he might derive that glory to him&s;elf, of which he robbed them. He rarely quotes an au|thor but with a view to cen&s;ure, and is not very fair in repre&s;enting the opinions which he cen|&s;ures.</P>
<P>The faults we have mentioned are &s;uch as might be expected in a man, who had the daring ambition to be tran&s;mitted to all future ages, as the prince of philo&s;ophers, as one who had carri|ed every branch of human knowledge to its ut|mo&s;t limit; and who was not very &s;crupulous about the means he took to obtain his end.</P>
<P>We ought, however, to do him the ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that although the pride and vanity of the &s;ophi&s;t appear too much in his writings in ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, yet in natural hi&s;tory the fidelity of his narrations &s;eems to be equal to his indu&s;try; and he always di&s;tingui&s;hes between what he knew and what he had by report. And even in ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, it would be unfair to impute to Ari&s;totle all the faults, all the ob&s;curities, and all the contradictions that are to be found in his writings. The greate&s;t part, and perhaps the be&s;t part, of his writings is lo&s;t. There is rea&s;on to doubt whether &s;ome of tho&s;e we a&s;cribe to him be really his; and whether what are his be not much vitiated and interpolated. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions are ju&s;tified by the fate of Ari&s;totle's writings, which is judiciou&s;ly related, from the be&s;t autho|rities, in Bayle's dictionary, under the article <HI>Tyrannion,</HI> to which I refer.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>Of Porphyry's Introduction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In this Introduction, which is addre&s;&s;ed to Chry&s;oarius, the author ob&s;erves, That in order to under&s;tand Ari&s;totle's doctrine concerning the categories, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know what a <HI>genus</HI> is, what a <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> what a <HI>&s;pecific difference,</HI> what a <HI>property,</HI> and what an <HI>accident;</HI> that the know|ledge of the&s;e is al&s;o very u&s;eful in definition, in divi&s;ion, and even in demon&s;tration: therefore he propo&s;es, in this little tract, to deliver &s;hortly and &s;imply the doctrine of the ancients, and chiefly of the Peripatetics, concerning the&s;e five <HI>predica|bles;</HI> avoiding the more intricate que&s;tions con|cerning them; &s;uch as, Whether <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>&s;pe|cies</HI> do really exi&s;t in nature? or, Whether they are only conceptions of the human mind? If they exi&s;t in nature, Whether they are corporeal or incorporeal? and, Whether they are inherent in the objects of &s;en&s;e, or disjoined from them? The&s;e, he &s;ays, are very difficult que&s;tions, and require accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but that he is not to meddle with them.</P>
<P>After this preface, he explains very minutely each of the five words above mentioned, divides

<P>The book begins with an explication of what is meant by univocal words, what by equivocal, and what by denominative. Then it is ob&s;erved, that what we &s;ay is either &s;imple, without com|po&s;ition or &s;tructure, as <HI>man, hor&s;e;</HI> or it has compo&s;ition and &s;tructure, as <HI>a man fights, the hor&s;e runs.</HI> Next comes a di&s;tinction between a &s;ubject of predication; that is, a &s;ubject of which any thing is a&s;tirmed or denied, and a &s;ub|ject of inhe&s;ion. The&s;e things are &s;aid to be in|herent in a &s;ubject, which although they are not a part of the &s;ubject, cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t with|out it, as figure in the thing figured. Of things that are, &s;ays Ari&s;totle, &s;ome may be predicated of a &s;ubject, but are in no &s;ubject; as, <HI>man</HI> may be predicated of James or John, but it is not in any &s;ubject. Some again are in a &s;ubject, but can be predicated of no &s;ubject. Thus, my knowledge in grammar is in me as its &s;ubject, but it can be predicated of no &s;ubject; becau&s;e it is an individual thing. Some are both in a &s;ub|ject, and may be predicated of a &s;ubject, as &s;cience; which is in the mind as its &s;ubject, and may be predicated of geometry. La&s;tly, Some things can neither be in a &s;ubject, nor be predica|ted of any &s;ubject. Such are all individual &s;ub|&s;tances, which cannot be predicated, becau&s;e they are individuals; and cannot be in a &s;ubject, becau&s;e they are &s;ub&s;tances. After &s;ome other &s;ubtilties a|bout predicates and &s;ubjects, we come to the cate|gories them&s;elves; the things above mentioned be|ing
<PB N="196" REF="200">
called by the &s;choolmen the <HI>antepraedicamenta.</HI> It may be ob&s;erved, however, that notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tinction now explained, the <HI>being in a &s;ubject,</HI> and the <HI>being predicated truly of a &s;ubject,</HI> are in the Analytics u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous phra&s;es; and this variation of &s;tyle has led &s;ome per&s;ons to think that the Categories were not wrote by Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P>Things which may be expre&s;&s;ed without com|po&s;ition or &s;tructure, are, &s;ays the author, redu|cible to the following heads. They are either <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> or <HI>quantity,</HI> or <HI>quality,</HI> or <HI>relatives,</HI> or <HI>place,</HI> or <HI>time,</HI> or <HI>having,</HI> or <HI>doing,</HI> or <HI>&s;uffering.</HI> The&s;e are the predicaments or categories. The fir&s;t four are largely treated of in four chapters; the others are &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ed over, as &s;ufficiently clear of them&s;elves. As a &s;pecimen, I &s;hall give a &s;ummary of what he &s;ays on the category of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sub&s;tances are either primary, to wit, indivi|dual &s;ub&s;tances, or &s;econdary, to wit, the gene|ra and &s;pecies of &s;ub&s;tances. Primary &s;ub&s;tances neither are in a &s;ubject, nor can be predicated of a &s;ubject; but all other things that exi&s;t, either are in primary &s;ub&s;tances, or may be predicated of them. For whatever can be predicated of that which is in a &s;ubject, may al&s;o be predica|ted of the &s;ubject it&s;elf. Primary &s;ub&s;tances are more &s;ub&s;tances than the &s;econdary; and of the &s;econdary, the &s;pecies is more a &s;ub&s;tance than the genus. If there were no primary, there could be no &s;econdary &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The properties of &s;ub&s;tance are the&s;e: 1. No &s;ub&s;tance is capable of inten&s;ion or remi&s;&s;ion. 2. No &s;ub&s;tance can be in any other thing as its &s;ub|ject of inhe&s;ion. 3. No &s;ub&s;tance has a contra|ry; for one &s;ub&s;tance cannot be contrary to ano|ther; nor can there be contrariety between a &s;ub&s;tance and that which is no &s;ub&s;tance. 4. The
<PB N="197" REF="201">
mo&s;t remarkable property of &s;ub&s;tance, is, that one and the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance may, by &s;ome change in it&s;elf, become the &s;ubject of things that are contrary. Thus, the &s;ame body may be at one time hot, at another cold.</P>
<P>Let this &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of Ari&s;totle's man|ner of treating the categories. After them, we have &s;ome chapters, which the &s;choolmen call <HI>po&s;tpraedicamenta;</HI> wherein, fir&s;t, the four kinds of oppo&s;ition of terms are explained; to wit, <HI>re|lative, privative,</HI> of <HI>contrariely,</HI> and of <HI>contradic|tion.</HI> This is repeated in all &s;y&s;tems of logic. La&s;t of all we have di&s;tinctions of the four Greek words which an&s;wer to the Latin ones, <HI>prius, &s;i|mul, motus,</HI> and <HI>habere.</HI></P>

<P>We are to con&s;ider, &s;ays Ari&s;totle, what a noun is, what a verb, what affirmation, what negation, what &s;peech. Words are the &s;igns of what pa&s;&s;eth in the mind; writing is the &s;ign of words. The &s;igns both of writing and of words are different in different nations, but the operati|ons of mind &s;ignified by them are the &s;ame. There are &s;ome operations of thought which are neither true nor fal&s;e. The&s;e are expre&s;&s;ed by nouns or verbs &s;ingly, and without compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A noun is a &s;ound which by compact &s;ignifies &s;omething without re&s;pect to time, and of which no part has &s;ignification by it&s;elf. The cries of bea&s;ts may have a natural &s;ignification, but they are not nouns. We give that name only to &s;ounds which have their &s;ignification by compact. The ca&s;es of a noun, as the genitive, dative, are not nouns. <HI>Non homo</HI> is not a noun, but, for di&s;tinction's &s;ake, may be called a <HI>nomen infinitum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="202">
A verb &s;ignifies &s;omething by compact with re|lation to time. Thus, <HI>valet</HI> is a verb; but <HI>vale|tuds</HI> is a noun, becau&s;e its &s;ignification has no re|lation to time. It is only the pre&s;ent ten&s;e of the indicative that is properly called a verb; the o|ther ten&s;es and moods are variations of the verb. <HI>Non valet</HI> may be called a <HI>verbum infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>Speech is &s;ound &s;ignificant by compact, of which &s;ome part is al&s;o &s;ignificant. And it is either enunciative, or not enunciative. Enunci|ative &s;peech is that which affirms or denies. As to &s;peech which is not enunciative, &s;uch as a pray|er or wi&s;h, the con&s;ideration of it belongs to ora|tory, or poetry. Every enunciative &s;peech mu&s;t have a verb, or &s;ome variation of a verb. Affir|mation is the enunciation of one thing concerning another. Negation is the enunciation of one thing from another. Contradiction is an affirma|tion and negation that are oppo&s;ite. This is a &s;ummary of the fir&s;t &s;ix chapters.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and eighth treat of the various kinds of enunciations or propo&s;itions, univer&s;al, particular, indefinite, and &s;ingular; and of the various kinds of oppo&s;ition in propo&s;itions, and the axioms concerning them. The&s;e things are repeated in every &s;y&s;tem of logic. In the ninth chapter he endeavours to prove, by a long meta|phy&s;ical rea&s;oning, that propo&s;itions re&s;pecting future contingencies are not, determinately, ei|ther true or fal&s;e; and that if they were, it would follow, that all things happen nece&s;&s;arily, and could not have been otherwi&s;e than as they are. The remaining chapters contain many mi|nute ob&s;ervations concerning the equipollency of propo&s;itions both pure and modal.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 1. <HI>On the Five Predicables.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE writers on logic have borrowed their materials almo&s;t entirely from Ari&s;totle's Organon, and Porphyry's Introduction. The Organon however was not wrote by Ari&s;totle as one work. It comprehends various tracts, wrote without the view of making them parts of one whole, and afterwards thrown together by his edi|tors under one name on account of their affi|nity. Many of his books that are lo&s;t would have made a part of the Organon, if they had been &s;aved.</P>
<P>The three treati&s;es of which we have given a brief account, are unconnected with each other, and with tho&s;e that follow. And although the fir&s;t was undoubtedly compiled by Porphyry, and the two la&s;t probably by Ari&s;totle, yet I con&s;ider them as the venerable remains of a philo&s;ophy more ancient than Ari&s;totle. Archytas of Taren|tum, an eminent mathematician and philo&s;opher of the Pythagorean &s;chool, is &s;aid to have wrote upon the ten categories. And the five predicables probably had their origin in the &s;ame &s;chool. Ari&s;totle, though abundantly careful to do ju&s;tice
<PB N="200" REF="204">
to him&s;elf, does not claim the invention of either. And Porphyry, without a&s;cribing the latter to Ari&s;totle, profe&s;&s;es only to deliver the doctrine of the ancients, and chiefly of the Peripatetics, con|cerning them.</P>
<P>The writers on logic have divided that &s;ci|ence into three parts; the fir&s;t treating of &s;imple apprehen&s;ion, and of terms; the &s;econd, of judgment, and of propo&s;itions; and the third, of rea&s;oning, and of &s;yllogi&s;ms. The materials of the fir&s;t part are taken from Porphyry's Introduc|tion, and the Categories; and tho&s;e of the &s;econd from the book of Interpretation.</P>
<P>A predicable, according to the grammatical form of the word, might &s;eem to &s;ignify, what|ever may be predicated, that is, affirmed or de|nied, of &s;ome &s;ubject. And in this &s;en&s;e every predicate would be a predicable. But the logici|ans give a different meaning to the word. They divide propo&s;itions into certain cla&s;&s;es, according to the relation which the predicate of the propo|&s;ition bears to the &s;ubject. The fir&s;t cla&s;s is that wherein the predicate is the <HI>genus</HI> of the &s;ubject; as when we &s;ay, <HI>This is a triangle, Jupiter is a planet.</HI> In the &s;econd cla&s;s, the predicate is a <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of the &s;ubject; as when we &s;ay, <HI>This triangle is right-angled.</HI> A third cla&s;s is when the predicate is the &s;pecific difference of the &s;ubject; as when we &s;ay, <HI>Every triangle has three &s;ides and three angles.</HI> A fourth when the predicate is a property of the &s;ubject; as when we &s;ay, <HI>The angles of every triangle are equal to two right an|gles.</HI> And a fifth cla&s;s is when the predicate is &s;omething accidental to the &s;ubject; as when we &s;ay, <HI>This triangle is neatly drawn.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es comprehends a great va|riety of propo&s;itions, having different &s;ubjects, and different predicates; but in each cla&s;s the re|lation
<PB N="201" REF="205">
between the predicate and the &s;ubject is the &s;ame. Now it is to this relation that logicians have given the name of <HI>a predicable.</HI> Hence it is, that although the number of predicates be infinite, yet the number of predicables can be no greater than that of the different relations which may be in propo&s;itions between the predicate and the &s;ub|ject. And if all propo&s;itions belong to one or other of the five cla&s;&s;es above mentioned, there can be but five predicables, to wit, <HI>genus, &s;pecies, differentia, proprium,</HI> and <HI>accidens.</HI> The&s;e might, with more propriety perhaps, have been called <HI>the five  cla&s;&s;es of predicates;</HI> but u&s;e has determined them to be called <HI>the five predicables.</HI></P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that as &s;ome objects of thought are individuals, &s;uch as, <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar, the city Rome;</HI> &s;o others are common to many in|dividuals, as <HI>good, great, virtuous, vicious.</HI> Of this la&s;t kind are all things expre&s;&s;ed by adjectives. Things common to many individuals were by the ancients called <HI>univer&s;als.</HI> All predicates are uni|ver&s;als, for they all have the nature of adjec|tives; and, on the other hand, all univer&s;als may be predicates. On this account univer&s;als may be divided into the &s;ame cla&s;&s;es as predicates; and as the five cla&s;&s;es of predicates above mentioned have been called  the five predicables, &s;o by the &s;ame kind of phra&s;eology they have been called <HI>the five univer&s;als;</HI> although they may more properly be called <HI>the five cla&s;&s;es of univer|&s;als.</HI></P>
<P>The doctrine of the five univer&s;als or predica|bles makes an e&s;&s;ential part of every &s;y&s;tem of lo|gic, and has been handed down without any change to this day. The very name of <HI>predicables</HI> &s;hews, that the author of this divi&s;ion, whoever he was, intended it as a complete enumeration of all the kinds of things that can be affirmed of any &s;ub|ject;
<PB N="202" REF="206">
and &s;o it has always been under&s;tood. So that it is implied in this divi&s;ion, that all that can be affirmed of any thing what&s;oever, is either the <HI>genus</HI> of the thing, or its <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> or its <HI>&s;pecific difference,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>property</HI> or <HI>accident</HI> belonging to it.</P>
<P>Burger&s;dick, a very acute writer in logic, &s;eems to have been aware, that &s;trong objections might be made to the five predicables, con&s;idered as a complete enumeration; but unwilling to allow any imperfection in this ancient divi&s;ion, he en|deavours to re&s;train the meaning of the word <HI>predicable,</HI> &s;o as to obviate objections. Tho&s;e things only, &s;ays he, are to be accounted predi|cables, which may be affirmed of <HI>many individu|als, truly, properly,</HI> and <HI>immediately.</HI> The con|&s;equence of putting &s;uch limitations upon the word <HI>predicable</HI> is, that in many propo&s;itions, perhaps in mo&s;t, the predicate is not a predicable. But admitting all his limitations, the enumeration will &s;till be very incomplete: for of many things we may affirm truly, properly, and immediately, their exi&s;tence, their end, their cau&s;e, their effect, and various relations which they bear to other things. The&s;e, and perhaps many more, are predicables in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word, no le&s;s than the five which have been &s;o long famous.</P>
<P>Although Porphyry, and all &s;ub&s;equent writers, make the predicables to be, in number, five; yet Ari&s;totle him&s;elf, in the beginning of the Topics, reduces them to four; and demon&s;trates, that they can be no more. We &s;hall give his demon&s;tration when we come to the Topics; and &s;hall only here ob&s;erve, that as Burger&s;dick ju&s;tifies the fivefold divi&s;ion, by re&s;training the meaning of the word <HI>predicable;</HI> &s;o Ari&s;totle ju&s;tifies the fourfold divi|&s;ion,
<PB N="203" REF="207">
by enlarging the meaning of the words <HI>pro|perty</HI> and <HI>accident.</HI></P>
<P>After all, I apprehend, that this ancient divi&s;ion of predicables, with all its imperfections, will bear a compari&s;on with tho&s;e which have been &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead by the mo&s;t celebrated mo|dern philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Locke, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tand|ing, having laid it down as a principle, That all our knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in perceiving certain agree|ments and di&s;agreements between our ideas, re|duces the&s;e agreements and di&s;agreements to four heads: to wit, 1. Identity and Diver&s;ity; 2. Re|lation; 3. Coexi&s;tence; 4. Real Exi&s;tence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 4. chap. 1.</NOTE>. Here are four predicables given as a complete enumeration, and yet not one of the ancient pre|dicables is included in the number.</P>
<P>The author of the Treati&s;e of Human Nature, proceeding upon the &s;ame principle, That all our knowledge is only a perception of the relations of our ideas, ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it may perhaps be e&s;teemed an endle&s;s ta&s;k, to enumerate all tho&s;e qualities which admit of compari&s;on, and by which the ideas of philo&s;ophical relation are produced: but if we diligently con&s;ider them, we &s;hall find, that without difficulty they may be compri&s;ed under &s;even general heads: 1. Re&s;emblance; 2. Identity; 3. Relations of Space and Time; 4. Relations of Quantity and Number; 5. Degrees of Quality; 6. Contra|riety; 7. Cau&s;ation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 33. and 125.</NOTE>."</Q> Here again are &s;even predicables given as a complete enumerati|on,
<PB N="204" REF="208">
wherein all the predicables of the ancients, as well as two of Locke's, are left out.</P>
<P>The ancients in their divi&s;ion attended only to categorical propo&s;itions which have one &s;ub|ject and one predicate; and of the&s;e, only to &s;uch as have a general term for their &s;ubject. The moderns, by their definition of knowledge, have been led to attend only to relative propo|&s;itions, which expre&s;s a relation between two &s;ubjects, and tho&s;e &s;ubjects they &s;uppo&s;e to be always ideas.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>On the Ten Categories, and on Divi&s;i|ons in general.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The intention of the categories or predicaments is, to mu&s;ter every object of human apprehen&s;ion under ten heads: for the categories are given as a complete enumeration of every thing which can be expre&s;&s;ed without <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> and <HI>&s;tructure;</HI> that is, of every thing which can be either the &s;ubject or the predicate of a propo&s;ition. So that as every &s;oldier belongs to &s;ome company, and every company to &s;ome regiment; in like manner every thing that can be the object of human thought, has its place in one or other of the ten categories; and by dividing and &s;ubdividing properly the &s;e|veral categories, all the notions that enter into the human mind may be mu&s;tered in rank and file, like an army in the day of battle.</P>
<P>The perfection of the divi&s;ion of categories into ten heads, has been &s;trenuou&s;ly defended by the followers of Ari&s;totle, as well as that of the five predicables. They are indeed of kin to each other. They breathe the &s;ame &s;pirit, and probab|ly had the &s;ame origin. By the one we are taught to mar&s;hal every term that can enter into
<PB N="205" REF="209">
a propo&s;ition, either as &s;ubject or predicate; and by the other, we are taught all the po&s;&s;ible relations which the &s;ubject can have to the pre|dicate. Thus, the whole furniture of the hu|man mind is pre&s;ented to us at one view, and contracted as it were, into a nut-&s;hell. To attempt, in &s;o early a period, a methodical de|lineation of the va&s;t region of human know|ledge, actual and po&s;&s;ible, and to point out the limits of every di&s;trict, was indeed magnani|mous in a high degree, and de&s;erves our admirati|on, while we lament that the human powers are unequal to &s;o bold a flight.</P>
<P>A regular di&s;tribution of things under pro|per cla&s;&s;es or heads, is without doubt, a great help both to memory and judgment. And as the philo&s;opher's province includes all things human and divine that can be objects of en|quiry, he is naturally led to attempt &s;ome ge|neral divi&s;ion, like that of the categories. And the invention of a divi&s;ion of this kind, which the &s;peculative part of mankind acquie&s;ced in for two thou&s;and years, marks a &s;uperiority of genius in the inventer, whoever he was. Nor does it appear, that the general divi&s;ions which, &s;ince the decline of the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy, have been &s;ub&s;tituted in place of the ten catego|ries, are more perfect.</P>
<P>Locke has reduced all things to three catego|ries; to wit, &s;ub&s;tances, modes, and relations. In this divi&s;ion, time, &s;pace, and number, three great objects of human thought, are omitted.</P>
<P>The author of the Treati&s;e of Human Nature has reduced all things to two categories; to wit, ideas, and impre&s;&s;ions: a divi&s;ion which is very well adapted to his &s;y&s;tem; and which puts me in mind of another made by an excellent mathe|matician in a printed the&s;is I have &s;een. In it the
<PB N="206" REF="210">
author, after a &s;evere cen&s;ure of the ten catego|ries of the Peripatetics, maintains, that there nei|ther are nor can be more than two categories of things; to wit, <HI>data,</HI> and <HI>quae&s;ita.</HI></P>
<P>There are two ends that may be propo&s;ed by &s;uch divi&s;ions The fir&s;t is, to methodize or di|ge&s;t in order what a man actually knows. This is neither unimportant nor impracticable; and in proportion to the &s;olidity and accuracy of a man's judgment, his divi&s;ions of things which he knows, will be elegant and u&s;eful. The &s;ame &s;ubject may admit, and even require, various divi&s;ions, according to the different points of view from which we contemplate it: nor does it follow, that becau&s;e one divi&s;ion is good, therefore ano|ther is naught. To be acquainted with the di|vi&s;ions of the logicians and metaphy&s;icians, with|out a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to them, may be of u&s;e in dividing the &s;ame &s;ubjects, or even tho&s;e of a different nature. Thus, Quintilian borrows from the ten categories his divi&s;ion of the topics of rhetorical argumentation. Of all me|thods of arrangement, the mo&s;t antiphilo&s;ophical &s;eems to be the invention of this age; I mean, the arranging the arts and &s;ciences by the letters of the alphabet, in dictionaries and encyclope|dies. With the&s;e authors the categories are, A, B, C, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another end commonly propo&s;ed by &s;uch divi|&s;ions, but very rarely attained, is, to exhau&s;t the &s;ubject divided; &s;o that nothing that belongs to it &s;hall be omitted. It is one of the general rules of divi&s;ion in all &s;y&s;tems of logic, That the divi|&s;ion &s;hould be adequate to the &s;ubject divided: a good rule, without doubt; but very often be|yond the reach of human power. To make a perfect divi&s;ion, a man mu&s;t have a perfect com|prehen&s;ion of the whole &s;ubject at one view.
<PB N="207" REF="211">
When our knowledge of the &s;ubject is imperfect, any divi&s;ion we can make of it, mu&s;t be like the fir&s;t &s;ketch of a painter, to be extended, con|tracted, or mended, as the &s;ubject &s;hall be found to require. Yet nothing is more common, not only among the ancient, but even among modern philo&s;ophers, than to draw from their incomplete divi&s;ions, conclu&s;ions which &s;uppo&s;e them to be perfect.</P>
<P>A divi&s;ion is a repo&s;itory which the philo&s;o|pher frames for holding his ware in convenient order. The philo&s;opher maintains, that &s;uch or &s;uch a thing is not good ware, becau&s;e there is no place in his ware-room that fits it. We are apt to yield to this argument in philo&s;ophy, but it would appear ridiculous in any other traffic.</P>
<P>Peter Ramus, who had the &s;pirit of a refor|mer in philo&s;ophy, and who had a force of ge|nius &s;ufficient to &s;hake the Ari&s;totelian fabric in many parts, but in&s;ufficient to erect any thing more &s;olid in its place, tried to remedy the im|perfection of philo&s;ophical divi&s;ions, by introdu|cing a new manner of dividing. His divi&s;ions always con&s;i&s;ted of two members, one of which was contradictory of the other; as if one &s;hould divide England into Middle&s;ex and what is not Middle&s;ex. It is evident that the&s;e two members comprehend all England: for the logicians ob|&s;erve, that a term, along with its contradictory, comprehend all things. In the &s;ame manner, we may divide what is not Middle&s;ex into Kent and what is not Kent. Thus one may go on by di|vi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions that are ab&s;olutely com|plete. This example may &s;erve to give an idea of the &s;pirit of Ramean divi&s;ions, which were in no &s;mall reputation about two hundred years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="212">
Ari&s;totle was not ignorant of this kind of divi|&s;ion. But he u&s;ed it only as a touch&s;tone to prove by induction the perfection of &s;ome other divi&s;ion, which indeed is the be&s;t u&s;e that can be made of it; when applied to the common pur|po&s;e of divi&s;ion, it is both inelegant, and bur|den&s;ome to the memory; and, after it has put one out of breath by endle&s;s &s;ubdivi&s;ions, there is &s;till a negative term left behind, which &s;hows that you are no nearer the end of your journey than when you began.</P>
<P>Until &s;ome more effectual remedy be found for the imperfection of divi&s;ions, I beg leave to pro|po&s;e one more &s;imple than that of Ramus. It is this: When you meet with a divi&s;ion of any &s;ubject imperfectly comprehended, add to the la&s;t member an <HI>et caetera.</HI> That this <HI>et caetera</HI> makes the divi&s;ion complete, is undeniable; and there|fore it ought to hold its place as a member, and to be always under&s;tood, whether expre&s;&s;ed or not, until clear and po&s;itive proof be brought, that the divi&s;ion is complete without it. And this &s;ame <HI>et caetera</HI> &s;hall be the repo&s;itory of all mem|bers that &s;hall in any future time &s;hew a good and valid right to a property in the &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 3. <HI>On Di&s;tinctions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much of logical divi&s;ions, we &s;hall next make &s;ome remarks upon di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>Since the philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle fell into di&s;|repute, it has been a common topic of wit and raillery, to inveigh again&s;t metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinc|tions. Indeed the abu&s;e of them in the &s;chola|&s;tic ages, &s;eems to ju&s;tify a general prejudice again&s;t them: and &s;hallow thinkers and writers have good rea&s;on to be jealous of di&s;tinctions,
<PB N="209" REF="213">
becau&s;e they make &s;ad work when applied to their flim&s;y compo&s;itions. But every man of true judgment, while he condemns di&s;tinctions that have no foundation in the nature of things, mu&s;t perceive, that indi&s;criminately to decry di&s;tinc|tions, is, to renounce all preten&s;ions to ju&s;t rea|&s;oning: for as fal&s;e rea&s;oning commonly proceeds from confounding things that are different, &s;o without di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;uch things, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to avoid error, or detect &s;ophi&s;try. The au|thority of Aquinas, or Suarez, or even of Ari|&s;totle, can neither &s;tamp a real value upon di&s;|tinctions of ba&s;e metal, nor ought it to hinder the currency of tho&s;e that have intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>Some di&s;tinctions are verbal, others are real. The fir&s;t kind di&s;tingui&s;h the various meanings of a word; &s;ome of which may be proper, others metaphorical. Di&s;tinctions of this kind make a part of the grammar of a language, and are of|ten ab&s;urd when tran&s;lated into another language. Real di&s;tinctions are equally good in all lan|guages, and &s;uffer no hurt by tran&s;lation. They di&s;tingui&s;h the different &s;pecies contained under &s;ome general notion, or the different parts con|tained in one whole.</P>
<P>Many of Ari&s;totle's di&s;tinctions are verbal merely; and therefore more proper materials for a dictionary of the Greek language than for a philo&s;ophical treati&s;e. At lea&s;t they ought never to have been tran&s;lated into other languages, when the idiom of the language will not ju&s;tify them: for this is to adulterate the language, to introduce foreign idioms into it without nece&s;&s;ity or u&s;e, and to make it ambiguous where it was not. The di&s;tinctions in the end of the Catego|ries of the four words <HI>prius, &s;imul, motus,</HI> and <HI>habere,</HI> are all verbal.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="214">
The modes or &s;pecies of <HI>prius,</HI> according to Ari&s;totle, are five. One thing may be prior to another; fir&s;t, in point of time; &s;econdly, in point of dignity; thirdly, in point of order; and &s;o forth. The modes of <HI>&s;imul</HI> are only three. It &s;eems this word was not u&s;ed in the Greek with &s;o great latitude as the other, although they are rela|tive terms.</P>
<P>The modes or &s;pecies of motion he makes to be fix, to wit, generation, corruption, in|crea&s;e, decrea&s;e, alteration, and change of place.</P>
<P>The modes or &s;pecies of <HI>having</HI> are eight. 1. Having a quality or habit, as having wi&s;dom. 2. Having quantity or magnitude. 3. Having things adjacent, as having a &s;word. 4. Having things as parts, as having hands or feet. 5. Ha|ving in a part or on a part, as having a ring on one's finger. 6. Containing, as a ca&s;k is &s;aid to have wine. 7. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as having lands or hou&s;es. 8. Having a wife.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tinction of this kind is Ari&s;totle's di&s;tinction of cau&s;es; of which he makes four kinds, efficient, material, formal, and final. The&s;e di&s;tinctions may de&s;erve a place in a dictionary of the Greek language; but in Eng|li&s;h or Latin they adulterate the language. Yet &s;o fond were the &s;choolmen of di&s;tinctions of this kind, that they added to Ari&s;totle's enu|meration, an impul&s;ive cau&s;e, an exemplary cau&s;e, and I do not know how many more. We &s;eem to have adopted into Engli&s;h a final cau&s;e; but it is merely a term of art, borrow|ed from the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy, without nece&s;&s;ity or u&s;e: for the Engli&s;h word <HI>end</HI> is as good as <HI>final cau&s;e,</HI> though not &s;o long nor &s;o learned.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 4. <HI>On Definitions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It remains that we make &s;ome remarks on Ari&s;totle's definitions, which have expo&s;ed him to much cen&s;ure and ridicule. Yet I think it mu&s;t be allowed, that in things which need de|finition, and admit of it, his definitions are com|monly judicious and accurate; and had he at|tempted to define &s;uch things only, his enemies had wanted great matter of triumph. I believe it may likewi&s;e be &s;aid in his favour, that until Locke's e&s;&s;ay was wrote, there was nothing of importance delivered by philo&s;ophers with regard to definition, beyond what Ari&s;totle has &s;aid upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He con&s;iders a definition as a &s;peech declaring what a thing is. Every thing e&s;&s;ential to the thing defined, and nothing more, mu&s;t be con|tained in the definition. Now the e&s;&s;ence of a thing con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e two parts: Fir&s;t, What is common to it with other things of the &s;ame kind; and, &s;econdly, What di&s;tingui&s;hes it from other things of the &s;ame kind. The fir&s;t is called the <HI>genus</HI> of the thing, the &s;econd its <HI>&s;pecific dif|ference.</HI> The definition therefore con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e two parts. And for finding them, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the ten categories; in one or other of which every thing in nature is to be found. Each category is a <HI>genus,</HI> and is divided into &s;o many &s;pecies, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;pecific differences. Each of the&s;e &s;pecies is again &s;ubdivided into &s;o many &s;pecies, with regard to which it is a genius. This divi&s;ion and &s;ubdi|vi&s;ion continues until we come to the lowe&s;t &s;pe|cies, which can only be divided into individuals, di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another, not by any &s;peci|fic
<PB N="212" REF="216">
difference, but by accidental differences of time, place, and other circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The category it&s;elf being the highe&s;t genus, is in no re&s;pect a &s;pecies, and the lowe&s;t <HI>&s;pecies</HI> is in no re&s;pect a <HI>genus;</HI> but every intermedi|ate order is a genus compared with tho&s;e that are below it, and a &s;pecies compared with tho&s;e above it. To find the definition of any thing, therefore, you mu&s;t take the genus which is im|mediately above its place in the category, and the &s;pecific <HI>difference,</HI> by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from other &s;pecies of the &s;ame <HI>genus.</HI> The&s;e two make a perfect definition. This I take to be the &s;ub&s;tance of Ari&s;totle's &s;y&s;tem; and pro|bably the &s;y&s;tem of the Pythagorean &s;chool be|fore Ari&s;totle, concerning definition.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;pecious appearance of this &s;y&s;tem, it has its defects. Not to repeat what was before &s;aid, of the imperfection of the divi&s;ion of things into ten categories, the &s;ubdi|vi&s;ions of each category are no le&s;s imperfect. Ari&s;totle has given &s;ome &s;ubdivi&s;ions of a few of them; and as far as he goes, his followers pretty unanimou&s;ly take the &s;ame road. But when they attempt to go farther, they take very different roads. It is evident, that if the &s;eries of each category could be completed, and the divi&s;ion of things into categories could be made perfect, &s;till the highe&s;t genus in each category could not be defined, becau&s;e it is not a &s;pecies; nor could individuals be defined, becau&s;e they have no &s;pecific difference. There are al&s;o many &s;pe|cies of things, who&s;e &s;pecific difference cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in language, even when it is evi|dent to &s;en&s;e, or to the under&s;tanding. Thus, green, red, and blue, are very di&s;tinct &s;pecies of colour; but who can expre&s;s in words where|in green differs from red or blue?</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="217">
Without borrowing light from the ancient &s;y&s;tem, we may perceive, that every definition mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of words that need no definition; and that to define the common words of a lan|guage that have no ambiguity, is trifling, if it could be done; the only u&s;e of a definition being to give a clear and adequate conception of the meaning of a word.</P>
<P>The logicians indeed di&s;tingui&s;h between the definition of a word, and the definition of a thing; con&s;idering the former as the mean office of a lexicographer, but the la&s;t as the grand work of a philo&s;opher. But what they have &s;aid about the definition of a thing, if it has a mean|ing, is beyond my comprehen&s;ion. All the rules of definition agree to the definition of a word: and if they mean by the definition of a thing, the giving an adequate conception of the nature and e&s;&s;ence of any thing that exi&s;ts; this is impo&s;&s;ible, and is the vain boa&s;t of men uncon&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of human under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The works of God are all imperfectly known by us. We &s;ee their out&s;ide, or perhaps we di&s;cover &s;ome of their qualities and relations, by ob&s;ervation and experiment, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by rea&s;on|ing; but we can give no definition of the mean|e&s;t of them which comprehends its real e&s;&s;ence. It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by Locke, that nominal e&s;|&s;ences only, which are the creatures of our own minds, are perfectly comprehended by us, or can be properly defined; and even of the&s;e there are many too &s;imple in their nature to admit of definition. When we cannot give preci&s;ion to our notions by a definition, we mu&s;t endeavour to do it by attentive reflection upon them, by ob&s;erving minutely their agreements and differ|ences, and e&s;pecially by a right under&s;tanding of
<PB N="214" REF="218">
the powers of our own minds by which &s;uch notions are formed.</P>
<P>The principles laid down by Locke with re|gard to definition, and with regard to the abu&s;e of words, carry conviction along with them; and I take them to be one of the mo&s;t important improvements made in logic &s;ince the days of Ari&s;totle; not &s;o much becau&s;e they enlarge our knowledge, as becau&s;e they make us &s;en&s;ible of our ignorance, and &s;hew that a great part of what &s;peculative men have admired as profound philo&s;ophy, is only a darkening of knowledge by words without under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>If Ari&s;totle had under&s;tood tho&s;e principles, many of his definitions, which furni&s;h matter of triumph to his enemies, had never &s;een the light: let us impute them to the times rather than to the man. The &s;ublime Plato, it is &s;aid, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have the definition of a man, and could find none better than <HI>Animal implume bipes;</HI> upon which Diogenes &s;ent to his &s;chool a cock with his feathers plucked off, de&s;iring to know whether it was a man or not.</P>

<P>The few hints contained in the beginning of the book concerning Interpretation, relating to the &s;tructure of &s;peech, have been left out on treati|&s;es of logic, as belonging rather to grammar; yet I apprehend this is a rich field of philo&s;ophical &s;peculation. Language being the expre&s;s image of human thought, the analy&s;is of the one mu&s;t corre&s;pond to that of the other. Nouns adjective and &s;ub&s;tantive, verbs active and pa&s;&s;ive, with their various moods, ten&s;es, and per&s;ons, mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ive of a like variety in the modes of

Things which are di&s;tingui&s;hed in all languages, &s;uch as &s;ub&s;tance and quality, action and pa&s;&s;ion, cau&s;e and effect, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the natural powers of the human mind. The philo&s;ophy of grammar, and that of the hu|man under&s;tanding, are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of language was pur&s;ued to a con&s;iderable extent, by the ancient commentators upon this book of Ari&s;totle. Their &s;peculations upon this &s;ubject, which are neither the lea&s;t in|genious nor the lea&s;t u&s;eful part of the Peripate|tic philo&s;ophy, were neglected for many ages, and lay buried in ancient manu&s;cripts, or in books little known, till they were lately brought to light by the learned Mr Harris in his Hermes.</P>
<P>The definitions given by Ari&s;totle, of a noun, of a verb, and of &s;peech, will hardly bear exa|mination. It is ea&s;y in practice to di&s;tingui&s;h the various parts of &s;peech; but very diffi|cult, if at all po&s;&s;ible, to give accurate definiti|ons of them.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that be&s;ides that kind of &s;peech called <HI>a propo&s;ition,</HI> which is always either true or fal&s;e, there are other kinds which are nei|ther true nor fal&s;e; &s;uch as, a prayer, or wi&s;h; to which we may add, a que&s;tion, a command, a promi&s;e, a contract, and many others. The&s;e Ari&s;totle pronounces to have nothing to do with his &s;ubject, and remits them to oratory, or poe|try; and &s;o they have remained bani&s;hed from the regions of philo&s;ophy to this day: yet I appre|hend, that an analy&s;is of &s;uch &s;peeches, and of the operations of mind which they expre&s;s, would be of real u&s;e, and perhaps would di&s;cover how imperfect an enumeration the logicians have gi|ven of the powers of human under&s;tanding when

<HEAD>SECT. 6. <HI>On Propo&s;itions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Mathematicians u&s;e the word <HI>propo&s;ition</HI> in a larger &s;en&s;e than logicians. A problem is called a <HI>propo&s;ition</HI> in mathematics, but in logic it is not a propo&s;ition: it is one of tho&s;e &s;peeches which are not enunciative, and which Ari&s;totle remits to oratory or poetry.</P>
<P>A propo&s;ition, according to Ari&s;totle, is a &s;peech wherein one thing is affirmed or denied of another. Hence it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the thing affirmed or denied, which is called <HI>the predicate,</HI> from the thing of which it is affirmed or denied, which is called the <HI>&s;ubject;</HI> and the&s;e two are called <HI>the terms of the propo&s;ition.</HI> Hence likewi&s;e it ap|pears, that propo&s;itions are either affirmative or negative; and this is called <HI>their quality.</HI> All af|firmative propo&s;itions have the &s;ame quality, &s;o likewi&s;e have all the negative; but an affirmative and a negative are contrary in their quality.</P>
<P>When the &s;ubject of a propo&s;ition is a general term, the predicate is affirmed or denied, either of the whole, or of a part. Hence propo&s;itions are di&s;tingui&s;hed into univer&s;al and particular. <HI>All men are mortal,</HI> is an univer&s;al propo&s;ition; <HI>Some men are learned,</HI> is a particular, and this is called <HI>the quantity of the propo&s;ition.</HI> All univer|&s;al propo&s;itions agree in quantity, as al&s;o all par|ticular: while an univer&s;al and a particular are &s;aid to differ in quantity. A propo&s;ition is called <HI>indefinite,</HI> when there is no mark either of uni|ver&s;ality or particularity annexed to the &s;ubject: thus, <HI>Man is of few days,</HI> is an indefinite pro|po&s;ition; but it mu&s;t be under&s;tood either as uni|ver&s;al or as particular, and therefore is not a
<PB N="217" REF="221">
third &s;pecies, but by interpretation is brought un|der one of the other two.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ingular propo&s;itions, which have not a general term but an individual for their &s;ubject; as, <HI>Alexander was a great conque|ror.</HI> The&s;e are con&s;idered by logicians as uni|ver&s;al, becau&s;e, the &s;ubject being indivi&s;ible, the predicate is affirmed or denied of the whole, and not of a part only. Thus all propo&s;itions, with regard to quality, are either affirmative or nega|tive; and with regard to quantity, are univer&s;al or particular; and taking in both quantity and quality, they are univer&s;al affirmatives, or uni|ver&s;al negatives, or particular affirmatives, or particular negatives. The&s;e four kinds, after the days of Ari&s;totle, came to be named by the names of the four fir&s;t vowels, A, E, I, O, according to the following di&s;tich:<Q><L><HI>A&s;&s;erit A, negat E, &s;ed univer&s;aliter ambae;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A&s;&s;erit I, negat O, &s;ed particulariter ambo.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>When the young logician is thus far in&s;tructed in the nature of propo&s;itions, he is apt to think there is no difficulty in analy&s;ing any propo&s;ition, and &s;hewing its &s;ubject and predicate, its quantity and quality; and indeed, unle&s;s he can do this, he will be unable to apply the rules of logic to u&s;e. Yet he will find, there are &s;ome difficulties in this analy&s;is, which are overlooked by Ari&s;totle altogether; and although they are &s;ometimes touched, they are not removed by his followers. For, 1. There are propo&s;itions in which it is difficult to find a &s;ubject and a predicate; as in the&s;e, <HI>It rains, It &s;nows.</HI> 2. In &s;ome propo&s;iti|ons either term may be made a &s;ubject or the predicate as you like be&s;t; as in this, <HI>Virtue is the</HI>

<HEAD>SECT. 1. <HI>Of the Conver&s;ion of Propo&s;itions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN attempting to give &s;ome account of the Analytics and of the Topics of Ari&s;totle, in|genuity requires me to confe&s;s, that though I have often purpo&s;ed to read the whole with care, and to under&s;tand what is intelligible, yet my courage and patience always failed before I had done. Why &s;hould I throw away &s;o much time and painful attention upon a thing of &s;o little real u&s;e? If I had lived in tho&s;e ages when the know|ledge of Ari&s;totle's Organon intitled a man to the highe&s;t rank in philo&s;ophy, ambition might have induced me to employ upon it &s;ome years painful &s;tudy; and le&s;s, I conceive, would not be &s;uffi|cient. Such reflections as the&s;e, always got the better of my re&s;olution, when the fir&s;t ardor be|gan to cool. All I can &s;ay is, that I have read &s;ome parts of the different books with care, &s;ome &s;lightly, and &s;ome perhaps not at all. I have glanced over the whole often, and when any thing attracted my attention, have dipped into it till my appetite was &s;atisfied. Of all reading
<PB N="220" REF="224">
it is the mo&s;t dry and the mo&s;t painful, employ|ing an infinite labour of demon&s;tration, about things of the mo&s;t ab&s;tract nature, delivered in a laconic &s;tyle, and often, I think, with affected ob&s;curity; and all to prove general propo&s;itions, which when applied to particular in&s;tances appear &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>There is probably but little in the Categories, or in the book of Interpretation, which Ari&s;totle could claim as his own invention: but the whole theory of &s;yllogi&s;ms he claims as his own, and as the fruit of much time and labour. And indeed it is a &s;tately fabrick, a monument of a great genius, which we could wi&s;h to have been more u&s;efully employed. There mu&s;t be &s;omething however adapted to plea&s;e the human under&s;tand|ing, or to flatter human pride, in a work which occupied men of &s;peculation for more than a thou&s;and years. The&s;e books are called <HI>Analy|tics,</HI> becau&s;e the intention of them is to re&s;olve all rea&s;oning into its &s;imple ingredients.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t book of the Fir&s;t Analitics, con&s;i&s;t|ing of forty-&s;ix chapters, may be divided into four parts; the fir&s;t treating of the conver&s;ion of propo&s;itions; the &s;econd, of the &s;tructure of &s;yl|logi&s;ms in all the different figures and modes; the third, of the invention of a middle term; and the la&s;t, of the re&s;olution of &s;yllogi&s;ms. We &s;hall give a brief account of each.</P>
<P>To convert a propo&s;ition, is to infer from it another propo&s;ition, who&s;e &s;ubject is the predi|cate of the fir&s;t, and who&s;e predicate is the &s;ub|ject of the fir&s;t. This is reduced by Ari&s;totle to three rules. 1. An univer&s;al negative may be converted into an univer&s;al negative: thus, <HI>No man is a quadruped;</HI> therefore, <HI>No quadruped is a man.</HI> 2. An univer&s;al affirmative can be con|verted only into a particular affirmative: thus,
<PB N="221" REF="225">
<HI>All men are mortal;</HI> therefore, <HI>Some mortal beings are men.</HI> 3. A particular affirmative may be con|verted into a particular affirmative: as, <HI>Some men are ju&s;t;</HI> therefore, <HI>Some ju&s;t per&s;ons are men.</HI> When a propo&s;ition may be converted without changing its quantity, this is called <HI>&s;imple conver&s;ion;</HI> but when the quantity is dimini&s;hed, as in the univer&s;al affirmative, it is called con|ver&s;ion <HI>per accidens.</HI></P>
<P>There is another kind of conver&s;ion, omitted in this place by Ari&s;totle, but &s;upplied by his followers, called <HI>conver&s;ion by contrapo&s;ition,</HI> in which the term which is contradictory to the pre|dicate is put for the &s;ubject, and the quality of the propo&s;ition is changed; as, <HI>All animals are &s;entient;</HI> therefore, <HI>What is in&s;entient is not an animal.</HI> A fourth rule of conver&s;ion therefore is, That an univer&s;al affirmative, and a particular negative, may be converted by contrapo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>Of the Figures and Modes of pure Syllogi&s;ms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A &s;yllogi&s;m is an argument, or rea&s;oning, con|&s;i&s;ting of three propo&s;itions, the la&s;t of which, called <HI>the conclu&s;ion,</HI> is inferred from the two pre|ceding, which are called <HI>the premi&s;es.</HI> The con|clu&s;ion having two terms, a &s;ubject and a predi|cate, its predicate is called the <HI>major</HI> term, and its &s;ubject the <HI>minor</HI> term. In order to prove the conclu&s;ion, each of its terms is in the pre|mi&s;es compared with a third term, called the <HI>middle</HI> term. By this means one of the premi&s;es will have for its two terms the major term and the middle term; and this premi&s;e is called the <HI>major</HI> premi&s;e, or the <HI>major</HI> propo&s;ition of the &s;yllogi&s;m. The other premi&s;e mu&s;t have for its
<PB N="222" REF="226">
two terms the minor term and the middle term, and it is called the <HI>minor</HI> propo&s;ition. Thus the &s;yllogi&s;m con&s;i&s;ts of three propo&s;itions, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the names of the <HI>major,</HI> the <HI>minor,</HI> and the <HI>conclu&s;ion:</HI> and although each of the&s;e has two terms, a &s;ubject and a predicate, yet there are only three different terms in all. The major term is always the predicate of the con|clu&s;ion, and is al&s;o either the &s;ubject or predicate of the major propo&s;ition. The minor term is al|ways the &s;ubject of the conclu&s;ion, and is al&s;o either the &s;ubject or predicate of the minor pro|po&s;ition. The middle term never enters into the conclu&s;ion, but &s;tands in both premi&s;es, ei|ther in the po&s;ition of &s;ubject or of predicate.</P>
<P>According to the various po&s;itions which the middle term may have in the premi&s;es, &s;yllogi&s;ms are &s;aid to be of various figures. Now all the po&s;&s;ible po&s;itions of the middle term are only four: for, fir&s;t, it may be the &s;ubject of the major propo&s;ition, and the predicate of the mi|nor, and then the &s;yllogi&s;m is of the fir&s;t fi|gure; or it may be the predicate of both pre|mi&s;es, and then the &s;yllogi&s;m is of the &s;econd fi|gure; or it may be the &s;ubject of both, which makes a &s;yllogi&s;m of the third figure; or it may be the predicate of the major propo&s;ition, and the &s;ubject of the minor, which makes the fourth figure. Ari&s;totle takes no notice of the fourth figure. It was added by the famous Galen, and is often called <HI>the Galenical figure.</HI></P>
<P>There is another divi&s;ion of &s;yllogi&s;ms accord|ing to their modes. The mode of a &s;yllogi&s;m is determined by the quality and quantity of the propo&s;itions of which it con&s;i&s;ts. Each of the three propo&s;itions mu&s;t be either an univer&s;al af|firmative, or an univer&s;al negative, or a parti|cular affirmative, or a particular negative. The&s;e
<PB N="223" REF="227">
four kinds of propo&s;itions, as was before ob&s;erv|ed, have been named by the four vowels, A, E, I, O; by which means the mode of a &s;yllogi&s;m is marked by any three of tho&s;e four vowels. Thus, A, A, A, denotes that mode in which the major, minor, and conclu&s;ion, are all uni|ver&s;al affirmatives; E, A, E, denotes that mode in which the major and conclu&s;ion are univer&s;al negatives, and the minor is an univer&s;al affirma|tive.</P>
<P>To know all the po&s;&s;ible modes of &s;yllogi&s;m, we mu&s;t find how many different combinations may be made of three out of the four vowels, and from the art of combination the number is found to be &s;ixty-four. So many po&s;&s;ible modes there are in every figure, con&s;equently in the three figures of Ari&s;totle there are one hundred and ninety-two, and in all the four figures two hundred and fifty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>Now the theory of &s;yllogi&s;m requires, that we &s;hew what are the particular modes in each fi|gure, which do, or do not, form a ju&s;t and con|clu&s;ive &s;yllogi&s;m, that &s;o the legitimate may be adopted, and the &s;purious rejected. This Ari|&s;totle has &s;hewn in the fir&s;t three figures, exa|mining all the modes one by one, and pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence upon each; and from this examination he collects &s;ome rules which may aid the memory in di&s;tingui&s;hing the fal&s;e from the true, and point out the properties of each figure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t figure has only four legitimate modes. The major propo&s;ition in this figure mu&s;t be uni|ver&s;al, and the minor affirmative; and it has this property, that it yields conclu&s;ions of all kinds, affirmative and negative, univer&s;al and par|ticular.</P>
<P>The &s;econd figure has al&s;o four legitimate modes. Its major propo&s;ition mu&s;t be univer&s;al,
<PB N="224" REF="228">
and one of the premi&s;es mu&s;t be negative. It yields conclu&s;ions both univer&s;al and particular, but all negative.</P>
<P>The third figure has &s;ix legitimate modes. Its minor mu&s;t always be affirmative; and it yields conclu&s;ions both affirmative and negative, but all particular.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rules that are proper to each figure, Ari&s;totle has given &s;ome that are common to all, by which the legitimacy of &s;yllogi&s;ms may be tried. The&s;e may, I think, be reduced to five. 1. There mu&s;t be only three terms in a &s;yllogi&s;m. As each term occurs in two of the propo&s;itions, it mu&s;t be preci&s;ely the &s;ame in both: if it be not, the &s;yllogi&s;m is &s;aid to have four terms, which makes a vitious &s;yllogi&s;m. 2. The middle term mu&s;t be taken univer&s;ally in one of the pre|mi&s;es. 3. Both premi&s;es mu&s;t not be particular propo&s;itions, nor both negative. 4. The con|clu&s;ion mu&s;t be particular, if either of the pre|mi&s;es be particular; and negative, if either of the premi&s;es be negative. 5. No term can be taken univer&s;ally in the conclu&s;ion, if it be not taken univer&s;ally in the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>For under&s;tanding the &s;econd and fifth of the&s;e rules, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that a term is &s;aid to be taken univer&s;ally, not only when it is the &s;ubject of an univer&s;al propo&s;ition, but when it is the predicate of a negative propo&s;ition; on the other hand, a term is &s;aid to be taken par|ticularly, when it is either the &s;ubject of a par|ticular, or the predicate of an affirmative pro|po&s;ition.</P>

<PB N="225" REF="229">
<HEAD>SECT. 3. <HI>Of the Invention of a Middle Term.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The third part of this book contains rules ge|neral and &s;pecial for the invention of a middle term; and this the author conceives to be of great utility. The general rules amount to this, That you are to con&s;ider well both terms of the propo|&s;ition to be proved; their definition, their pro|perties, the things which may be affirmed or de|nied of them, and tho&s;e of which they may be affirmed or denied: tho&s;e things collected together, are the materials from which your middle term is to be taken.</P>
<P>The &s;pecial rules require you to con&s;ider the quantity and quality of the propo&s;ition to be proved, that you may di&s;cover in what mode and figure of &s;yllogi&s;m the proof is to proceed. Then from the materials before collected, you mu&s;t &s;eek a middle term which has that relation to the &s;ub|ject and predicate of the propo&s;ition to be prov|ed, which the nature of the &s;yllogi&s;m requires. Thus, &s;uppo&s;e the propo&s;ition I would prove is an univer&s;al affirmative, I know by the rules of &s;yl|logi&s;ms, that there is only one legitimate mode in which an univer&s;al affirmative propo&s;ition can be proved; and that is the fir&s;t mode of the fir&s;t figure. I know likewi&s;e, that in this mode both the premi&s;es mu&s;t be univer&s;al affirmatives; and that the middle term mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of the major, and the predicate of the minor. There|fore of the terms collected according to the ge|neral rule, I &s;eek out one or more which have the&s;e two properties; fir&s;t, That the predicate of the propo&s;ition to be proved can be univer&s;ally affirmed of it; and, &s;econdly, That it can be univer&s;ally affirmed of the &s;ubject of the propo|&s;ition
<PB N="226" REF="230">
to be proved. Every term you can find which has tho&s;e two properties, will &s;erve you as a middle term, but no other. In this way, the author gives &s;pecial rules for all the various kinds of propo&s;itions to be proved; points out the va|rious modes in which they may be proved, and the properties which the middle term mu&s;t have to make it fit for an&s;wering that end. And the rules are illu&s;trated, or rather, in my opinion, pur|po&s;ely darkened, by putting letters of the alphabet for the &s;everal terms.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<DIV6 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 1. <HI>Of the Conver&s;ion of Propo&s;itions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have given a &s;ummary view of the theory of pure &s;yllogi&s;ms as delivered by Ari&s;totle, a theory of which he claims the &s;ole invention. And I believe it will be difficult, in any &s;cience, to find &s;o large a &s;y&s;tem of truths of &s;o very ab&s;tract and &s;o general a nature, all fortified by demon&s;tration, and all invented and perfected by one man. It &s;hows a force of ge|nius, and labour of inve&s;tigation, equal to the mo&s;t arduous attempts. I &s;hall now make &s;ome remarks upon it.</P>
<P>As to the conver&s;ion of propo&s;itions, the writers on logic commonly &s;atisfy them&s;elves with illu&s;|trating each of the rules by an example, con|ceiving them to be &s;elf-evident when applied to particular ca&s;es. But Ari&s;totle has given demon|&s;trations of the rules he mentions. As a &s;peci|men, I &s;hall give his demon&s;tration of the fir&s;t rule. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let A B be an univer&s;al negative pro|po&s;ition; I &s;ay, that if A is in no B, it will
<PB N="229" REF="233">
follow that B is in no A. If you deny this con&s;equence, let B be in &s;ome A, for example, in C; then the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition will not be true; for C is of the B's."</Q> In this demon|&s;tration, if I under&s;tand it, the third rule of con|ver&s;ion is a&s;&s;umed, that if B is in &s;ome A, then A mu&s;t be in &s;ome B, which indeed is contrary to the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition. If the third rule be a&s;&s;umed for proof of the fir&s;t, the proof of all the three goes round in a circle; for the &s;econd and third rules are proved by the fir&s;t. This is a fault in rea&s;oning which Ari&s;totle condemns, and which I &s;hould be very unwilling to charge him with, if I could find any better meaning in his demon&s;tra|tion. But it is indeed a fault very difficult to be avoided, when men attempt to prove things that are &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>The rules of conver&s;ion cannot be applied to all propo&s;itions, but only to tho&s;e that are cate|gorical; and we are left to the direction of com|mon &s;en&s;e in the conver&s;ion of other propo&s;itions. To give an example: Alexander was the &s;on of Philip; therefore Philip was the father of Alex|ander: A is greater than B; therefore B is le&s;s than A. The&s;e are conver&s;ions which, as far as I know, do not fall within any rule in logic; nor do we find any lo&s;s for want of a rule in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Even in the conver&s;ion of categorical propo&s;i|tions, it is not enough to tran&s;po&s;e the &s;ubject and predicate. Both mu&s;t undergo &s;ome change, in order to fit them for their new &s;tation: for in every propo&s;ition the &s;ubject mu&s;t be a &s;ub&s;tan|tive, or have the force of a &s;ub&s;tantive; and the predicate mu&s;t be an adjective, or have the force of an adjective. Hence it follows, that when the &s;ubject is an individual, the propo|&s;ition admits not of conver&s;ion. How for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="230" REF="234">
&s;hall we convert this propo&s;ition, God is omni&s;cient?</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;how, that the doctrine of the conver&s;ion of propo&s;itions is not &s;o complete as it appears. The rules are laid down without any limitation; yet they are fitted only to one cla&s;s of propo&s;itions, to wit, the categorical; and of the&s;e only to &s;uch as have a general term for their &s;ubject.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>On Additions made to Ari&s;totle's Theory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Although the logicians have enlarged the fir&s;t and &s;econd parts of logic, by explaining &s;ome technical words and di&s;tinctions which Ari&s;totle had omitted, and by giving names to &s;ome kinds of propo&s;itions which he overlooks; yet in what concerns the theory of categorical &s;yllogi&s;ms, he is more full, more minute and particular, than any of them: &s;o that they &s;eem to have thought this capital part of the Organon rather redundant than deficient.</P>
<P>It is true, that Galen added a fourth figure to the three mentioned by Ari&s;totle. But there is rea&s;on to think that Ari&s;totle omitted the fourth figure, not through ignorance or inattention, but of de&s;ign, as containing only &s;ome indirect modes, which, when properly expre&s;&s;ed, fall into the fir&s;t figure.</P>
<P>It is true al&s;o, that Peter Ramus, a profe&s;&s;ed enemy of Ari&s;totle, introduced &s;ome new modes that are adapted to &s;ingular propo&s;itions; and that Ari&s;totle takes no notice of &s;ingular propo&s;itions, either in his rules of conver&s;ion, or in the modes of &s;yllogi&s;m. But the friends of Ari&s;totle have &s;hewn, that this improvement of Ramus is more &s;pecious than u&s;eful. Singular propo&s;itions have
<PB N="231" REF="235">
the force of univer&s;al propo&s;itions, and are &s;ub|ject to the &s;ame rules. The definition given by Ari&s;totle of an univer&s;al propo&s;ition applies to them; and therefore he might think, that there was no occa&s;ion to multiply the modes of &s;yllogi&s;m upon their account.</P>
<P>The&s;e attempts, therefore, &s;how rather incli|nation than power, to di&s;cover any material defect in Ari&s;totle's theory.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t valuable addition made to the theory of categorical &s;yllogi&s;ms, &s;eems to be the inventi|on of tho&s;e technical names given to the legiti|mate modes, by which they may be ea&s;ily remem|bered, and which have been compri&s;ed in the&s;e barbarous ver&s;es.<Q><L><HI>Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio,</HI> dato primae;</L>
<L><HI>Ce&s;are, Came&s;tris, Fe&s;tino, Baroco,</HI> &s;ecundae;</L>
<L>Tertia grande &s;onans recitat <HI>Darapti, Felapton;</HI></L>
<L>Adjungens <HI>Di&s;amis, Dati&s;i, Bocardo, Feri&s;on.</HI></L></Q> In the&s;e ver&s;es, every legitimate mode belonging to the three figures has a name given to it, by which it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed and remember|ed. And this name is &s;o contrived as to de|note its nature: for the name has three vowels, which denote the kind of each of its propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>Thus, a &s;yllogi&s;m in <HI>Bocardo</HI> mu&s;t be made up of the propo&s;itions denoted by the three vowels, O, A, O; that is, its major and conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be particular negative propo&s;itions, and its minor an univer&s;al affirmative; and being in the third figure, the middle term mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of both premi&s;es.</P>
<P>This is the my&s;tery contained in the vowels of tho&s;e barbarous words. But there are other my&s;|teries
<PB N="232" REF="236">
contained in their con&s;onants: for by their means, a child may be taught to reduce any &s;yl|logi&s;m of the &s;econd or third figure to one of the fir&s;t. So that the four modes of the fir&s;t figure being directly proved to be conclu&s;ive, all the modes of the other two are proved at the &s;ame time, by means of this operation of re|duction. For the rules and manner of this reduction, and the different &s;pecies of it, called <HI>o&s;ten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>per impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> I refer to the logi|cians, that I may not di&s;clo&s;e all their my&s;te|ries.</P>
<P>The invention contained in the&s;e ver&s;es is &s;o in|genious, and &s;o great an adminicle to the dextrous management of &s;yllogi&s;ms, that I think it very probable that Ari&s;totle had &s;ome contrivance of this kind, which was kept as one of the &s;ecret doctrines of his &s;chool, and handed down by tra|dition, until &s;ome body brought it to light. This is offered only as a conjecture, leaving it to tho&s;e who are better acquainted with the mo&s;t ancient commentators on the Analytics, either to refute or to confirm it.</P>

<P>We may ob&s;erve, that Ari&s;totle hardly ever gives examples of real &s;yllogi&s;ms to illu&s;trate his rules. In demon&s;trating the legitimate modes, he takes A, B, C, for the terms of the &s;yllogi&s;m. Thus, the fir&s;t mode of the fir&s;t figure is demon&s;trated by him in this manner. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if A is attributed to every B, and B to every C, it fol|lows nece&s;&s;arily, that A may be attributed to eve|ry C."</Q> For di&s;proving the illegitimate modes, he u&s;es the &s;ame manner; with this difference,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
that he commmonly for an example gives three real terms, &s;uch as, <HI>bonum, habitus, prudentia;</HI> of which three terms you are to make up a &s;yllogi&s;m of the figure and mode in que&s;tion, which will appear to be inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The commentators, and &s;y&s;tematical writers in logic, have &s;upplied this defect; and given us real examples of every legitimate mode in all the figures. This we mu&s;t acknowledge to be chari|tably done, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the imagination in the concep|tion of matters &s;o very ab&s;tract; but whether it was prudently done for the honour of the art, may be doubted. I am afraid this was to unco|ver the nakedne&s;s of the theory; and has contri|buted much to bring it into contempt: for when one con&s;iders the &s;illy and unin&s;tructive rea&s;onings that have been brought forth by this grand organ of &s;cience, he can hardly forbear crying out, <HI>Parturiunt montes, et na&s;citur ridiculus mus.</HI> Ma|ny of the writers of logic are acute and ingenious, and much practi&s;ed in the &s;yllogi&s;tical art; and there mu&s;t be &s;ome rea&s;on why the examples they have given of &s;yllogi&s;ms are &s;o lean.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;peak of the rea&s;on afterwards; and &s;hall now give a &s;yllogi&s;m in each figure as an example <LIST>
<ITEM>No work of God is bad;</ITEM>
<ITEM>The natural pa&s;&s;ions and appetites of men are the work of God;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore none of them is bad.</ITEM>
</LIST> In this &s;yllogi&s;m, the middle term, <HI>work of God,</HI> is the &s;ubject of the major and the predicate of the minor; &s;o that the &s;yllogi&s;m is of the fir&s;t fi|gure. The mode is that called <HI>Celarent;</HI> the major and conclu&s;ion being both univer&s;al nega|tives, and the minor an univer&s;al affirmative.

And to &s;how of what ductile materials &s;yllogi&s;ms are made, we may, by converting &s;imply the major propo|&s;ition, reduce it to a good &s;yllogi&s;m of the &s;econd figure, and of the mode <HI>Ce&s;are,</HI> thus: <LIST>

</LIST></P>
<P>Here the middle term <HI>prai&s;e-worthy</HI> being the predicate of both premi&s;es, the &s;yllogi&s;m is of the &s;econd figure; and &s;eeing it is made up of the propo&s;itions, A, O, O, the mode is <HI>Baroco.</HI> It will be found to agree both with the general and &s;pecial rules: and it may be reduced into a good &s;yllogi&s;m of the fir&s;t figure upon converting the major by contrapo&s;ition, thus: <LIST>
<ITEM>What is not prai&s;e-worthy is not virtuous:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Some plea&s;ures are not prai&s;e-worthy;</ITEM>

<P>That this &s;yllogi&s;m is conclu&s;ive, common &s;en&s;e pronounces, and all logicians mu&s;t allow; but it is &s;omewhat unpliable to rules, and re|quires a little &s;training to make it tally with them.</P>
<P>That it is of the fir&s;t figure is beyond di&s;pute; but to what mode of that figure &s;hall we refer it? This is a que&s;tion of &s;ome difficulty. For, in the fir&s;t place, the premi&s;es &s;eem to be both ne|gative, which contradicts the third general rule; and moreover, it is contrary to a &s;pecial rule of the fir&s;t figure, That the minor &s;hould be nega|tive. The&s;e are the difficulties to be removed.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="239">
Some logicians think, that the two negative particles in the major are equivalent to an affir|mative; and that therefore the major propo&s;ition, <HI>What is not prai&s;e-worthy, is not virtuous,</HI> is to be accounted an affirmative propo&s;ition. This if granted, &s;olves one difficulty; but the other re|mains. The mo&s;t ingenious &s;olution, therefore, is this: Let the middle term be <HI>not prai&s;e-wor|thy.</HI> Thus making the negative particle a part of the middle term, the &s;yllogi&s;m &s;tands thus: <LIST>
<ITEM>Whatever is <HI>not prai&s;e-worthy</HI> is not virtuous;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Some plea&s;ures are <HI>not prai&s;e-worthy;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore &s;ome plea&s;ures are not virtuous.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By this analy&s;is, the major becomes an univer&s;al negative, the minor a particular affirmative, and the conclu&s;ion a particular negative, and &s;o we have a ju&s;t &s;yllogi&s;m in <HI>Ferio.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee, by this example, that the quality of propo&s;itions is not &s;o invariable, but that, when occa&s;ion requires, an affirmative may be degra|ded into a negative, or a negative exalted to an affirmative. Another example: <LIST>

<HEAD>SECT. 4. <HI>On the Demon&s;tration of the Theory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Ari&s;totle and his followers have thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to bring this theory of categori|cal &s;yllogi&s;ms to a &s;cience, to demon&s;trate, both that the fourteen authori&s;ed modes conclude ju&s;t|ly, and that none of the re&s;t do. Let us now &s;ee how this has been executed.</P>
<P>As to the legitimate modes, Ari&s;totle, and tho&s;e who follow him the mo&s;t clo&s;ely, demon|&s;trate the four modes of the fir&s;t figure directly from an axiom called the <HI>Dictum de omni et nullo.</HI> The amount of the axiom is, That what is affir|med of a whole <HI>genus,</HI> may be affirmed of all the &s;pe|cies and individuals belonging to the <HI>genus;</HI> and that what is denied of the whole genus, may be denied of its &s;pecies and individuals. The four modes of the fir&s;t figure are evidently included in this axiom. And as to the legitimate modes of the other figures, they are proved by reducing them to &s;ome mode of the fir&s;t. Nor is there any other principle a&s;&s;umed in the&s;e reductions but the axioms concerning the conver&s;ion of propo&s;iti|ons, and in &s;ome ca&s;es the axioms concerning the oppo&s;ition of propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As to the illegitimate modes, Ari&s;totle has ta|ken the labour to try and condemn them one by one in all the three figures: but this is done in &s;uch a manner that it is very painful to follow him. To give a &s;pecimen. In order to prove, that tho&s;e modes of the fir&s;t figure in which the major is particular, do not conclude, he proceeds thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If A is or is not in &s;ome B, and B, in every C, no conclu&s;ion follows. Take for the terms in the affirmative ca&s;e, <HI>good, habit, pru|dence,</HI> in the negative, <HI>good, habit, igno|rance.</HI>"</Q>
<PB N="237" REF="241">
This laconic &s;tyle, the u&s;e of &s;ym|bols not familiar, and in place of giving an exam|ple, his leaving us to form one from three a&s;&s;ign|ed terms, give &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ment to a reader, that he is like one reading a book of riddles.</P>
<P>Having thus a&s;certained the true and fal&s;e modes of a figure, he &s;ubjoins the particular rules of that figure, which &s;eem to be deduced from the particular ca&s;es before determined. The ge|neral rules come la&s;t of all, as a general corollary from what goes before.</P>
<P>I know not whether it is from a diffidence of Ari&s;totle's demon&s;trations, or from an apprehen|&s;ion of their ob&s;curity, or from a de&s;ire of im|proving upon his method, that almo&s;t all the writers in logic I have met with, have inverted his order, beginning where he ends, and ending where he begins. They fir&s;t demon&s;trate the ge|neral rules, which belong to all the figures, from three axioms; then from the general rules and the nature of each figure, they demon&s;trate the &s;pecial rules of each figure. When this is done, no|thing remains but to apply the&s;e general and &s;pecial rules, and to reject every mode which contradicts them.</P>
<P>This method has a very &s;cientific appearance; and when we con&s;ider, that by a few rules once demon&s;trated, an hundred and &s;eventy-eight fal&s;e modes are de&s;troyed at one blow, which Ari|&s;totle had the trouble to put to death one by one, it &s;eems to be a great improvement. I have only one objection to the three axioms.</P>
<P>The three axioms are the&s;e: 1. Things which agree with the &s;ame third, agree with one ano|ther. 2. When one agrees with the third, and the other does not, they do not agree with one another. 3. When neither agrees with the third, you cannot thence conclude, either that they do,
<PB N="238" REF="242">
or do not agree with one another. If the&s;e axi|oms are applied to mathematical quantities, to which they &s;eem to relate when taken literally, they have all the evidence which an axiom ought to have: but the logicians apply them in an analogical &s;en&s;e to things of another nature. In order, therefore, to judge whether they are tru|ly axioms, we ought to &s;trip them of their figu|rative dre&s;s, and to &s;et them down in plain Eng|li&s;h, as the logicians under&s;tand them. They amount therefore to this. 1. If two things be affirmed of a third, or the third be affirmed of them; or if one be affirmed of the third, and the third affirmed of the other; then they may be affirmed one of the other. 2. If one is af|firmed of the third, or the third of it, and the other denied of the third, or the third of it, they may be denied one of the other. 3. If both are denied of the third, or the third of them; or if one is denied of the third, and the third denied of the other; nothing can be inferred.</P>
<P>When the three axioms are thus put in plain Engli&s;h, they &s;eem not to have that degree of evidence which axioms ought to have; and if there is any defect of evidence in the axioms, this defect will be communicated to the whole edifice rai&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>It may even be &s;u&s;pected, that an attempt, by any method, to demon&s;trate, that a &s;yllogi&s;m is conclu&s;ive, is an impropriety &s;omewhat like that of attempting to demon&s;trate an axiom. In a ju&s;t &s;yllogi&s;m, the connection between the pre|mi&s;es and the conclu&s;ion is not only real, but im|mediate; &s;o that no propo&s;ition can come be|tween them to make their connection more appa|rent. The very intention of a &s;yllogi&s;m is, to leave nothing to be &s;upplied that is nece&s;&s;ary to a complete demon&s;tration. Therefore a man of
<PB N="239" REF="243">
common under&s;tanding, who has a perfect com|prehen&s;ion of the premi&s;es, finds him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of admitting the conclu&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing the premi&s;es to be true; and the conclu&s;ion is connected with the premi&s;es with all the force of intuitive evidence. In a word, an immediate conclu&s;ion &s;een in the premi&s;es, by the light of common &s;en&s;e; and where that is wanting, no kind of rea&s;oning will &s;upply its place.</P>

<P>The &s;low progre&s;s of u&s;eful knowledge, during the many ages in which the &s;yllogi&s;tic art was mo&s;t highly cultivated as the only guide to &s;ci|ence, and its quick progre&s;s &s;ince that art was di&s;|u&s;ed, &s;ugge&s;t a pre&s;umption again&s;t it; and this pre&s;umption is &s;trengthened by the puerility of the examples which have always been brought to illu&s;trate its rules.</P>
<P>The ancients &s;eem to have had too high noti|ons, both of the force of the rea&s;oning power in man, and of the art of &s;yllogi&s;m as its guide. Mere rea&s;oning can carry us but a very little way in mo&s;t &s;ubjects. By ob&s;ervation, and experi|ments properly conducted, the &s;tock of human knowledge may be enlarged without end; but the power of rea&s;oning alone, applied with vi|gour through a long life, would only carry a man round, like a hor&s;e in a mill, who labours hard, but makes no progre&s;s. There is indeed an ex|ception to this ob&s;ervation in the mathematical &s;ciences. The relations of quantity are &s;o vari|ous, and &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of exact men&s;uration, that long trains of accurate rea&s;oning on that &s;ubject may be formed, and conclu&s;ions drawn very re|mote
<PB N="240" REF="244">
from the fir&s;t principles. It is in this &s;ci|ence, and tho&s;e which depend upon it, that the power of rea&s;oning triumphs: in other matters its trophies are incon&s;iderable. If any man doubt this, let him produce, in any &s;ubject unconnec|ted with mathematics, a train of rea&s;oning of &s;ome length, leading to a conclu&s;ion, which with|out this train of rea&s;oning would never have been brought within human &s;ight. Every man ac|quainted with mathematics can produce thou&s;ands of &s;uch trains of rea&s;oning. I do not &s;ay, that none &s;uch can be produced in other &s;ciences; but I believe they are few, and not ea&s;ily found; and that if they are found, it will not be in &s;ub|jects that can be expre&s;&s;ed by categorical propo|&s;itions, to which alone the theory of figure and mode extends.</P>
<P>In matters to which that theory extends, a man of good &s;en&s;e, who can di&s;tingui&s;h things that differ, and avoid the &s;nares of ambiguous words, and is moderately practi&s;ed in &s;uch mat|ters, &s;ees at once all that can be inferred from his premi&s;es; or finds, that there is but a very &s;hort &s;tep to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the power of rea&s;oning is &s;o feeble by nature, e&s;pecially in &s;ubjects to which this theo|ry can be applied, it would be unrea&s;onable to expect great effects from it. And hence we &s;ee the rea&s;on why the examples brought to illu&s;trate it by the mo&s;t ingenious logicians, have rather tended to bring it into contempt.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be thought, that the &s;yllogi&s;tic art may be an u&s;eful engine in mathematics, in which pure rea&s;oning has ample &s;cope: Fir&s;t, It may be ob&s;erved, That facts are unfavourable to this opinion: for it does not appear, that Euclid, or Apollonius, or Archimedes, or Hugens, or Newton, ever made the lea&s;t u&s;e of this art; and
<PB N="241" REF="245">
I am even of opinion, that no u&s;e can be made of it in mathematics. I would not wi&s;h to advance this ra&s;hly, &s;ince Ari&s;totle has &s;aid, that mathe|maticians rea&s;on for the mo&s;t part in the fir&s;t figure. What led him to think &s;o was, that the fir&s;t figure only yields conclu&s;ions that are uni|ver&s;al and affirmative, and the conclu&s;ions of ma|thematics are commonly of that kind. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that the propo&s;itions of ma|thematics are not categorical propo&s;itions, con|&s;i&s;ting of one &s;ubject and one predicate. They expre&s;s &s;ome relation which one quantity bears to another, and on that account mu&s;t have three terms. The quantities compared make two, and the relation between them is a third. Now to &s;uch propo&s;itions we can neither apply the rules concerning the conver&s;ion of propo&s;itions, nor can they enter into a &s;yllogi&s;m of any of the figures or modes. We ob&s;erved before, that this con|ver&s;ion, <HI>A is greater than B,</HI> therefore <HI>B is le&s;s than A,</HI> does not fall within the rules of conver|&s;ion given by Ari&s;totle or the logicians; and we now add, that this &s;imple rea&s;oning, <HI>A is equal to B, and B to C;</HI> therefore <HI>A is equal to C,</HI> can|not be brought into any &s;yllogi&s;m in figure and mode. There are indeed &s;yllogi&s;ms into which mathematical propo&s;itions may enter, and of &s;uch we &s;hall afterwards &s;peak: but they have nothing to do with the &s;y&s;tem of figure and mode.</P>
<P>When we go without the circle of the mathe|matical &s;ciences, I know nothing in which there &s;eems to be &s;o much demon&s;tration as in that part of logic which treats of the figures and modes of &s;yllogi&s;m; but the few remarks we have made, &s;hew, that it has &s;ome weak places: and be|&s;ides, this &s;y&s;tem cannot be u&s;ed as an engine to rear it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="246">
The compa&s;s of the &s;yllogi&s;tic &s;y&s;tem as an en|gine of &s;cience, may be di&s;cerned by a compen|dious and general view of the conclu&s;ion drawn, and the argument u&s;ed to prove it, in each of the three figures.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t figure, the conclu&s;ion affirms or de|nies &s;omething, of a certain &s;pecies or individu|al; and the argument to prove this conclu&s;ion is, That the &s;ame thing may be affirmed or denied of the whole genus to which that &s;pecies or indi|vidual belongs.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd figure, the conclu&s;ion is, That &s;ome &s;pecies or individual does not belong to &s;uch a genus; and the argument is, That &s;ome attri|bute common to the whole genus does not belong to that &s;pecies or individual.</P>
<P>In the third figure, the conclu&s;ion is, That &s;uch an attribute belongs to part of a genus; and the argument is, That the attribute in que&s;tion belongs to a &s;pecies or individual which is part of that genus.</P>
<P>I apprehend, that, in this &s;hort view, every conclu&s;ion that falls within the compa&s;s of the three figures, as well as the mean of proof, is comprehended. The rules of all the figures might be ea&s;ily deduced from it; and it appears, that there is only one principle of rea&s;oning in all the three; &s;o that it is not &s;trange, that a &s;yllo|gi&s;m of one figure &s;hould be reduced to one of another figure.</P>
<P>The general principle in which the whole ter|minates, and of which every categorical &s;yllogi&s;m is only a particular application, is this, That what is affirmed or denied of the whole genus, may be affirmed or denied of every &s;pecies and individual belonging to it. This is a principle of undoubted certainty indeed, but of no great depth. Ari&s;totle and all the logicians a&s;&s;ume it as
<PB N="243" REF="247">
an axiom or fir&s;t principle, from which the &s;yl|logi&s;tic &s;y&s;tem, as it were, takes its departure: and after a tedious voyage, and great expence of demon&s;trations, it lands at la&s;t in this prin|ciple as its ultimate conclu&s;ion. <HI>O curas homi|num!

<HEAD>SECT. 6. <HI>On Modal Syllogi&s;ms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Categorical propo&s;itions, be&s;ides their quantity and quality, have another affection, by which they are divided into pure and modal. In a pure propo&s;ition, the predicate is barely affirmed or denied of the &s;ubject; but in a modal propo&s;i|tion, the affirmation or negation is modified, by being declared to be nece&s;&s;ary or contingent, or po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible. The&s;e are the four modes ob&s;erved by Ari&s;totle, from which he denomi|nates a propo&s;ition modal. His genuine di&s;ciples maintain, that the&s;e are all the modes that can affect an affirmation or negation, and that the enumeration is complete. Othes maintain, that this enumeration is incomplete; and that when an affirmation or negation is &s;aid to be certain or uncertain, probable or improbable, this makes a modal propo&s;ition, no le&s;s than the four modes of Ari&s;totle. We &s;hall not enter into this di&s;pute; but proceed to ob&s;erve, that the epithets of <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>modal</HI> are applied to &s;yllogi&s;ms as well as to propo&s;itions. A pure &s;yllogi&s;m is that in which both premi&s;es are pure propo&s;itions. A modal &s;yllogi&s;m is that in which either of the premi&s;es is a modal propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The &s;yllogi&s;ms of which we have already &s;aid &s;o much, are tho&s;e only which are pure as well as categorical. But when we con&s;ider, that through all the figures and modes, a &s;yllogi&s;m
<PB N="244" REF="248">
may have one premi&s;e modal of any of the four modes, while the other is pure, or it may have both premi&s;es modal, and that they may be ei|ther of the &s;ame mode or of different modes; what prodigious variety ari&s;es from all the&s;e com|binations? Now it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a logician, to &s;hew how the conclu&s;ion is affected in all this variety of ca&s;es. Ari&s;totle has done this in his Fir&s;t Analytics, with immen&s;e labour; and it will not be thought &s;trange, that when he had employed only four chapters in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing one hundred and ninety-two modes, true and fal&s;e, of pure &s;yllogi&s;ms, he &s;hould employ fifteen up|on modal &s;yllogi&s;ms.</P>
<P>I am very willing to excu&s;e my&s;elf from enter|ing upon this great branch of logic, by the judg|ment and example of tho&s;e who cannot be char|ged either with want of re&s;pect to Ari&s;totle, or with a low e&s;teem of the &s;yllogi&s;tic art.</P>
<P>Keckerman, a famous Dantzican profe&s;&s;or, who &s;pent his life in teaching and writing logic, in his huge folio &s;y&s;tem of that &s;cience, publi&s;hed ann. 1600, calls the doctrine of the modals the <HI>crux logicorum.</HI> With regard to the &s;chola&s;tic doctors, among whom this was a proverb, <HI>De modalibus non gu&s;tabit a&s;inus,</HI> he thinks it very du|bious, whether they tortured mo&s;t the modal &s;yllogi&s;ms, or were mo&s;t tortured by them. But tho&s;e crabbed geniu&s;es, &s;ays he, made this doc|trine &s;o very thorny, that it is fitter to tear a man's wits in pieces than to give them &s;olidity. He de&s;ires it to be ob&s;erved, that the doctrine of modals is adapted to the Greek language. The modal terms were frequently u&s;ed by the Greeks in their di&s;putations; and, on that account, are &s;o fully handled by Ari&s;totle: but in the Latin tongue you &s;hall hardly ever meet with them. Nor do I remember, in all my experience, &s;ays

he, to have ob&s;erved any man in danger of being foiled in a di&s;pute, through his ignorance of the modals.</P>
<P>This author, however, out of re&s;pect to Ari|&s;totle, treats pretty fully of modal propo&s;itions, &s;hewing how to di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;ubject and predicate, their quantity and quality. But the modal &s;yllogi&s;ms he pa&s;&s;es over altogether.</P>
<P>Ludovicus Vives, whom I mention, not as a devotee of Ari&s;totle, but on account of his own judgment and learning, thinks that the doctrine of modals ought to be bani&s;hed out of logic, and remitted to grammar; and that if the grammar of the Greek tongue had been brought to a &s;y&s;|tem in the time of Ari&s;totle, that mo&s;t acute philo&s;opher would have &s;aved the great labour he has be&s;towed on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Burger&s;dick, after enumerating five cla&s;&s;es of modal &s;yllogi&s;ms, ob&s;erves, that they require ma|ny rules and cautions, which Ari&s;totle hath hand|led diligently; but as the u&s;e of them is not great, and their rules are very difficult, he thinks it not worth while to enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them; recommending to tho&s;e who would under&s;tand them, the mo&s;t learned paraphra&s;e of Joannes Monlorius, upon the fir&s;t book of the Fir&s;t Ana|lytics.</P>
<P>All the writers of logic for two hundred years back that have fallen into my hands, have pa&s;&s;ed over the rules of modal &s;yllogi&s;ms with as little ceremony. So that this great branch of the doc|trine of &s;yllogi&s;m, &s;o diligently handled by Ari|&s;totle, fell into neglect, if not contempt, even while the doctrine of pure &s;yllogi&s;ms continued in the highe&s;t e&s;teem. Moved by the&s;e authori|ties, I &s;hall let this doctrine re&s;t in peace, with|out giving the lea&s;t di&s;turbance to its a&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 7. <HI>On Syllogi&s;ms that do not belong to Figure and Mode.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Ari&s;totle gives &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon imper|fect &s;yllogi&s;ms: &s;uch as, the Enthimema, in which one of the premi&s;es is not expre&s;&s;ed but under&s;tood: Induction, wherein we collect an univer&s;al from a full enumeration of particulars: and Examples, which are an imperfect induction. The logicians have copied Ari&s;totle upon the&s;e kinds of rea&s;oning, without any con&s;iderable im|provement. But to compen&s;ate the modal &s;yllo|gi&s;ms, which they have laid a&s;ide, they have given rules for &s;everal kinds of &s;yllogi&s;m, of which Ari&s;totle takes no notice. The&s;e may be reduced to two cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cla&s;s comprehends the &s;yllogi&s;ms into which any exclu&s;ive, re&s;trictive, exceptive, or reduplicative propo&s;ition enters. Such propo&s;i|tions are by &s;ome called <HI>exponible,</HI> by others <HI>imperfectly modal.</HI> The rules given with regard to the&s;e are obvious, from a ju&s;t interpretation of the propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s is that of hypothetical &s;yllo|gi&s;ms, which take that denomination from having a hypothetical propo&s;ition for one or both premi|&s;es. Mo&s;t logicians give the name of <HI>hypothetical</HI> to all complex propo&s;itions which have more terms than one &s;ubject and one predicate. I u&s;e the word in this large &s;en&s;e; and mean by hypotheti|cal &s;yllogi&s;ms, all tho&s;e in which either of the pre|mi&s;es con&s;i&s;ts of more terms than two. How many various kinds there may be of &s;uch &s;yllogi&s;ms, has never been a&s;certained. The logicians have given names to &s;ome; &s;uch as, the copulative, the con|ditional,
<PB N="247" REF="251">
by &s;ome called hypothetical, and the di&s;|junctive.</P>
<P>Such &s;yllogi&s;ms cannot be tried by the rules of figure and mode. Every kind would require rules peculiar to it. Logicians have given rules for &s;ome kinds; but there are many that have not &s;o much as a name.</P>
<P>The Dilemma is con&s;idered by mo&s;t logicians as a &s;pecies of the disjunctive &s;yllogi&s;m. A re|markable property of this kind is, that it may &s;ometimes be happily retorted: it is, it &s;eems, like a hand-grenade, which, by dextrous management, may be thrown back, &s;o as to &s;pend its force upon the a&s;&s;ailant. We &s;hall conclude this tedious account of &s;yllogi&s;ms, with a dilemma mentioned by <HI>A. Gellius,</HI> and from him by many logicians, as in&s;oluble in any other way.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Euathlus, a rich young man, de&s;irous of learning the art of pleading, applied to Prota|goras, a celebrated &s;ophi&s;t, to in&s;truct him, promi&s;ing a great &s;um of money as his reward; one half of which was paid down; the other half he bound him&s;elf to pay as &s;oon as he &s;hould plead a cau&s;e before the judges, and gain it.

<HEAD>SECT. 1. <HI>Of the La&s;t Analytics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Fir&s;t Analytics, &s;yllogi&s;ms are con&s;ider|ed in re&s;pect of their form; they are now to be con&s;idered in re&s;pect of their matter. The form lies in the nece&s;&s;ary connection between the premi&s;es and the conclu&s;ion; and where &s;uch a connection is wanting, they are &s;aid to be informal, or vicious in point of form.</P>
<P>But where there is no fault in the form, there may be in the matter; that is, in the propo&s;i|tions of which they are compo&s;ed, which may be true or fal&s;e, probable or improbable.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="253">
When the premi&s;es are certain, and the con|clu&s;ion drawn from them in due form, this is demon&s;tration, and produces &s;cience. Such &s;yl|logi&s;ms are called <HI>apodictical;</HI> and are handled in the two books of the La&s;t Analytics. When the premi&s;es are not certain, but probable only, &s;uch &s;yllogi&s;ms are called <HI>dialectical;</HI> and of them he treats in the eight books of the Topics. But there are &s;ome &s;yllogi&s;ms which &s;eem to be perfect both in matter and form, when they are not really &s;o: as, a face may &s;eem beautiful which is but painted. The&s;e being apt to de|ceive, and produce a fal&s;e opinion, are called <HI>&s;o|phi&s;tical;</HI> and they are the &s;ubject of the book concerning Sophi&s;ms.</P>
<P>To return to the La&s;t Analytics, which treat of demon&s;tration and of &s;cience: We &s;hall not pre|tend to abridge tho&s;e books; for Ari&s;totle's wri|tings do not admit of abridgment: no man can &s;ay what he &s;ays in fewer words; and he is not often guilty of repetition. We &s;hall only give &s;ome of his capital conclu&s;ions, omitting his long rea&s;onings and nice di&s;tinctions, of which his ge|nius was wonderfully productive.</P>
<P>All demon&s;tration mu&s;t be built upon princi|ples already known; and the&s;e upon others of the &s;ame kind; until we come at la&s;t to fir&s;t principles, which neither can be demon&s;trated, nor need to be, being evident of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We cannot demon&s;trate things in a circle, &s;upporting the conclu&s;ion by the premi&s;es, and the premi&s;es again by the conclu&s;ion. Nor can there be an infinite number of middle terms between the fir&s;t principle and the con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In all demon&s;tration, the fir&s;t principles, the conclu&s;ion, and all the intermediate propo&s;iti|ons, mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary, general, and eternal
<PB N="250" REF="254">
truths: for of things fortuitous, contingent, or mutable, or of individual things, there is no de|mon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Some demon&s;trations prove only, that the thing is thus affected; others prove, why it is thus af|fected. The former may be drawn from a re|mote cau&s;e, or from an effect: but the latter mu&s;t be drawn from an immediate cau&s;e; and are the mo&s;t perfect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t figure is be&s;t adapted to demon&s;trati|on, becau&s;e it affords conclu&s;ions univer&s;ally af|firmative; and this figure is commonly u&s;ed by the mathematicians.</P>
<P>The demon&s;tration of an affirmative pro|po&s;ition is preferable to that of a negative; the demon&s;tration of an univer&s;al to that of a particu|lar; and direct demon&s;tration to that <HI>ad ab&s;urdum.</HI></P>
<P>The principles are more certain than the con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>There cannot be opinion and &s;cience of the &s;ame thing at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd book we are taught, that the que&s;|tions that may be put, with regard to any thing, are four: 1. Whether the thing be thus affected. 2. Why it is thus affected. 3. Whether it exi&s;ts. 4. What it is.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions Ari&s;totle, in good Greek, calls the <HI>What is it</HI> of a thing. The &s;choolmen, in very barbarous Latin, called this, the <HI>quiddity</HI> of a thing. This quiddity, he proves by many arguments, cannot be demon&s;trated, but mu&s;t be fixed by a definition. This gives oc|ca&s;ion to treat of definition, and how a right defi|nition &s;hould be formed. As an example he gives a definition of the number <HI>three,</HI> and defines it to be the fir&s;t odd number.</P>
<P>In this book he treats al&s;o of the four kinds of cau&s;es; efficient, material, formal and final.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="255">
Another thing treated of in this book is, the manner in which we acquire fir&s;t principles, which are the foundation of all demon&s;tration. The&s;e are not innate, becau&s;e we may be for a great part of life ignorant of them: nor can they be deduced demon&s;tratively from any antecedent knowledge, otherwi&s;e they would not be fir&s;t principles. Therefore he concludes, that fir&s;t principles are got by induction, from the informa|tions of &s;en&s;e. The &s;en&s;es give us informations of individual things, and from the&s;e by induction we draw general conclu&s;ions: for it is a max|im with Ari&s;totle, That there is nothing in the under&s;tanding which was not before in &s;ome &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The knowledge of fir&s;t principles, as it is not acquired by demon&s;tration, ought not to be called &s;cience; and therefore he calls it <HI>intelli|gence.</HI></P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>Of the Topics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the Topics, is, to &s;hew a method by which a man may be able to rea&s;on with probability and con&s;i&s;tency upon every que&s;|tion that may occur.</P>
<P>Every que&s;tion is either about the genus of the &s;ubject, or its &s;pecific difference, or &s;ome thing proper to it, or &s;omething accidental.</P>
<P>To prove that this divi&s;ion is complete, Ari&s;to|tle rea&s;ons thus: Whatever is attributed to a &s;ub|ject, it mu&s;t either be, that the &s;ubject can be re|ciprocally attributed to it, or that it cannot. If the &s;ubject and attribute can be reciprocated, the attribute either declares what the &s;ubject is, and then it is a definition; or it does not declare what the &s;ubject is, and then it is a property. If the attribute cannot be reciprocated, it mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing
<PB N="252" REF="256">
contained in the definition, or not. If it is contained in the definition of the &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be the genus of the &s;ubject, or its &s;pecific diffe|rence; for the definition con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e two. If it is not contained in the definition of the &s;ub|ject, it mu&s;t be an accident.</P>
<P>The furniture proper to fit a man for arguing dialectically may be reduced to the&s;e four heads: 1. Probable propo&s;itions of all &s;orts, which may on occa&s;ion be a&s;&s;umed in an argument. 2. Di&s;|tinctions of words which are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ignification. 3. Di&s;tinctions of things which are not &s;o far a&s;under but that they may be taken for one and the &s;ame. 4. Similitudes.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and the five following books are taken up in enumerating the topics or heads of argument that may be u&s;ed in que&s;tions about the genus, the definition, the properties, and the ac|cidents of a thing; and occa&s;ionally he introduces the topics for proving things to be the &s;ame, or different; and the topics for proving one thing to be better or wor&s;e than another.</P>
<P>In this enumeration of topics, Ari&s;totle has &s;hewn more the fertility of his genius, than the accuracy of method. The writers of logic &s;eem to be of this opinion: for I know none of them that has followed him clo&s;ely upon this &s;ubject. They have con&s;idered the topic of argumentation as reducible to certain axioms. For in&s;tance, when the que&s;tion is about the genus of a thing, it mu&s;t be determined by &s;ome axiom about genus and &s;pecies; when it is about definition, it mu&s;t be determined by &s;ome axiom relating to definiti|on, and things defined: and &s;o of other que&s;tions. They have therefore reduced the doctrine of the topics to certain axioms or canons, and di&s;po&s;ed the&s;e axioms in order under certain heads.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="257">
This method &s;eems to be more commodious and elegant than that of Ari&s;totle. Yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Ari&s;totle has furni&s;hed the materials from which all the logicians have bor|rowed their doctrine of topics: and even Cicero, Quintilian, and other rhetorical writers, have been much indebted to the topics of Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t, as far as I know, who made an attempt of this kind: and in this he acted up to the magnanimity of his own genius, and that of ancient philo&s;ophy. Every &s;ubject of human thought had been reduced to ten categories; eve|ry thing that can be attributed to any &s;ubject, to five predicables: he attempted to reduce all the forms of rea&s;oning to fixed rules of figure and mode, and to reduce all the topics of argumentation under certain heads; and by that means to collect as it were into one &s;tore all that can be &s;aid on one &s;ide or the other of every que&s;tion, and provide a grand ar&s;enal, from which all future combatants might be furni&s;hed with arms offen&s;ive and defen|&s;ive in every cau&s;e, &s;o as to leave no room to fu|ture generations to invent any thing new.</P>
<P>The la&s;t book of the Topics is a code of the laws, according to which a &s;yllogi&s;tical di&s;putation ought to be managed, both on the part of the a&s;&s;ailant and defendant. From which it is evi|dent, that this philo&s;opher trained his di&s;ciples to contend, not for the truth merely, but for victo|ry.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 3. <HI>Of the book concerning Sophi&s;ms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A &s;yllogi&s;m which leads to a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion, mu&s;t be vicious either in matter or form: for from true principles nothing but truth can be ju&s;tly dedu|ced. If the matter be faulty, that is, if either of the premi&s;es be fal&s;e, that premi&s;e mu&s;t be deni|ed
<PB N="254" REF="258">
by the defendant. If the form be faulty, &s;ome rule of &s;yllogi&s;m is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed; and it is the part of the defendant to &s;hew, what general or &s;pecial rule it is that is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. So that, if he is an able logician, he will be impregnable in the defence of truth, and may re&s;i&s;t all the at|tacks of the &s;ophi&s;t. But as there are &s;yllogi&s;ms which may &s;eem to be perfect both in matter and form, when they are not really &s;o, as a piece of money may &s;eem to be good coin, when it is adulterate; &s;uch fallacious &s;yllogi&s;ms are con&s;ide|red in this treati&s;e, in order to make a defendant more expert in the u&s;e of his defen&s;ive weapons.</P>
<P>And here the author, with his u&s;ual magnani|mity, attempts to bring all the fallacies that can enter into a &s;yllogi&s;m under thirteen heads; of which &s;ix lie in the diction or language, and &s;even not in the diction.</P>
<P>The fallacies in diction are, 1. When an ambigu|ous word is taken at one time in one &s;en&s;e, and at another time in another. 2. When an ambiguous phra&s;e is taken in the &s;ame manner. 3. and 4. are ambiguities in &s;yntax; when words are conjoined in &s;yntax that ought to be disjoined; or disjoined when they ought to be conjoined. 5. is an am|biguity in pro&s;ody, accent, or pronunciation. 6. An ambiguity ari&s;ing from &s;ome figure of &s;peech.</P>
<P>When a &s;ophi&s;m of any of the&s;e kinds is tran|&s;lated into another language, or even rendered into unambiguous expre&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame lan|guage, the fallacy is evident, and the &s;yllogi&s;m appears to have four terms.</P>
<P>The &s;even fallacies which are &s;aid not to be in the diction, but in the thing, have their proper names in Greek and in Latin, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed. Without minding their names, we &s;hall give a brief account of their nature.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="255" REF="259">
1. The fir&s;t is, Taking an accidental conjunc|tion of things for a natural or nece&s;&s;ary connecti|on: as, when from an accident we infer a pro|perty; when from an example we infer a rule; when from a &s;ingle act we infer a habit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Taking that ab&s;olutely which ought to be taken comparatively, or with a certain limitation. The con&s;truction of language often leads into this fallacy: for in all languages it is common to u&s;e ab&s;olute terms, to &s;ignify things which carry in them &s;ome &s;ecret compari&s;on; or to u&s;e unlimi|ted terms, to &s;ignify what from its nature mu&s;t be limited.</P>
<P N="3">3. Taking that for the cau&s;e of a thing which was only an occa&s;ion, or concomitant.</P>
<P N="4">4. Begging the que&s;tion. This is done, when the thing to be proved, or &s;ome thing equivalent, is a&s;&s;umed in the premi&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. Mi&s;taking the que&s;tion. When the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;yllogi&s;m is not the thing that ought to be proved, but &s;omething el&s;e that is mi&s;taken for it.</P>
<P N="6">6. When that which is not a con&s;equence is mi&s;taken for a con&s;equence; as if, becau&s;e all Africans are black, it were taken for granted that all the blacks are Africans.</P>
<P N="7">7. The la&s;t fallacy lies in propo&s;itions that are complex, and imply two affirmations, whereof one may be true, and the other fal&s;e; &s;o that whether you grant the propo&s;ition, or deny it, you are intangled: as when it is affirmed, that &s;uch a man has left off playing the fool. If it be granted, it implies, that he did play the fool for|merly. If it be denied, it implies, or &s;eems to imply, that he plays the fool &s;till.</P>
<P>In this enumeration, we ought, in ju&s;tice to Ari&s;totle, to expect only the fallacies incident to categorical &s;yllogi&s;ms. And I do not find,
<PB N="256" REF="260">
that the logicians have made any additions to it when taken in this view; although they have gi|ven &s;ome other fallacies that are incident to &s;yllo|gi&s;ms of the hypothetical kind, particularly the fallacy of an incomplete enumeration in disjunc|tive &s;yllogi&s;ms and dilemmas.</P>
<P>The different &s;pecies of &s;ophi&s;ms above men|tioned are not &s;o preci&s;ely defined by Ari&s;totle, or by &s;ub&s;equent logicians, but that they allow of great latitude in the application; and it is often dubious under what particular &s;pecies a &s;ophi&s;ti|cal &s;yllogi&s;m ought to be cla&s;&s;ed. We even find the &s;ame example brought under one &s;pecies by one author, and under another &s;pecies by another. Nay, what is more &s;trange, Ari&s;totle him&s;elf employs a long chapter in proving by a particular induction, that all the &s;even may be brought un|der that which we have called <HI>mi&s;taking the que&s;ti|on,</HI> and which is commonly called <HI>ignoratio elenchi.</HI> And indeed the proof of this is ea&s;y, without that laborious detail which Ari&s;totle u&s;es for the pur|po&s;e: for if you lop off from the conclu&s;ion of a &s;ophi&s;tical &s;yllogi&s;m all that is not &s;upported by the premi&s;es, the conclu&s;ion, in that ca&s;e, will always be found different from that which ought to have been proved; and &s;o it falls under the <HI>ignoratio elenchi.</HI></P>
<P>It was probably Ari&s;totle's aim, to reduce all the po&s;&s;ible variety of &s;ophi&s;ms, as he had at|tempted to do of ju&s;t &s;yllogi&s;ms, to certain defi|nite &s;pecies: but he &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible that he had fallen &s;hort in this la&s;t attempt. When a ge|nus is properly divided into its &s;pecies, the &s;pecies &s;hould not only, when taken together, exhau&s;t the whole genus; but every &s;pecies &s;hould have its own precinct &s;o accurately defined, that one &s;hall not encroach upon another. And when an individual can be &s;aid to belong to two or three
<PB N="257" REF="261">
different &s;pecies, the divi&s;ion is imperfect; yet this is the ca&s;e of Ari&s;totle's divi&s;ion of the &s;ophi&s;ms, by his own acknowledgment. It ought not therefore to be taken for a divi&s;ion &s;trictly logical. It may rather be compared to the &s;everal &s;pecies or forms of action invented in law for the redre&s;s of wrongs. For every wrong there is a remedy in law by one action or another: but &s;ometimes a man may take his choice among &s;everal different actions. So every &s;ophi&s;tical &s;yllogi&s;m may, by a little art, be brought under one or other of the &s;pecies men|tioned by Ari&s;totle, and very often you may take your choice of two or three.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the enumeration of the various kinds of &s;ophi&s;ms, there are many other things in this treati&s;e concerning the art of managing a &s;yllogi&s;|tical di&s;pute with an antagoni&s;t. And indeed, if the pa&s;&s;ion for this kind of litigation, which reigned for &s;o many ages, &s;hould ever again lift up its head, we may predict, that the Organon of Ari&s;totle will then become a fa&s;hionable &s;tudy: for it contains &s;uch admirable materials and docu|ments for this art, that it may be &s;aid to have brought it to a &s;cience.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this treati&s;e ought not to be overlooked: it manife&s;tly relates, not to the pre|&s;ent treati&s;e only, but al&s;o to the whole analytics and topics of the author. I &s;hall therefore give the &s;ub&s;tance of it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of tho&s;e who may be called inventers, &s;ome have made important additions to things long before begun, and carried on through a cour&s;e of ages; others have given a &s;mall beginning to things which, in &s;ucceeding times, will be brought to greater perfection.

<HEAD>Reflections on the Utility of Logic, and the Means of its Improvement.</HEAD>
<DIV6 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 1. <HI>Of the Utility of Logic.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MEN rarely leave one extreme without running into the contrary. It is no wonder, therefore, that the exce&s;&s;ive admiration of Ari&s;|totle, which continued for &s;o many ages, &s;hould end in an undue contempt; and that the high e&s;teem of logic as the grand engine of &s;cience, &s;hould at la&s;t make way for too unfavourable an opinion, which &s;eems now prevalent, of its being unworthy of a place in a liberal education. Tho&s;e who think according to the fa&s;hion, as the greate&s;t part of men do, will be as prone to go into this extreme, as their grandfathers were to go into the contrary.</P>
<P>Laying a&s;ide prejudice, whether fa&s;hionable or unfa&s;hionable, let us con&s;ider whether logic is, or may be made &s;ub&s;ervient to any good purpo&s;e. Its profe&s;&s;ed end is, to teach men to think, to judge, and to rea&s;on, with preci&s;ion and accura|cy. No man will &s;ay that this is a matter of no importance; the only thing, therefore, that ad|mits of doubt, is, whether it can be taught.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="264">
To re&s;olve this doubt, it may be ob&s;erved, that our rational faculty is the gift of God, given to men in very different mea&s;ure. Some have a larger portion, &s;ome a le&s;s; and where there is a remarkable defect of the natural power, it can|not be &s;upplied by any culture what&s;oever. But this natural power, even where it is &s;tronge&s;t, may lie dead for want of the means of improve|ment; and a &s;avage may have been born with as good faculties as a Bacon or a Newton. The amazing difference that appears in advanced life, is owing to this, that the talent of one was bu|ried, being never put to u&s;e, while that of the other was cultivated to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, that the chief mean of improving our rational power, is the vigorous exerci&s;e of it, in various ways, and in different &s;ubjects, by which the habit is ac|quired of exerci&s;ing it properly. Without &s;uch exerci&s;e, and good &s;en&s;e over and above, a man who has &s;tudied logic all his life may, after all, be only a petulant wrangler, without true judgment, or &s;kill of rea&s;oning, in any &s;cience.</P>
<P>I take this to be Locke's meaning, when, in his Thoughts on Education, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you would have your &s;on to rea&s;on well, let him read Chillingworth."</Q> The &s;tate of things is much altered &s;ince Locke wrote. Logic has been much improved, chiefly by his writings; and yet much le&s;s &s;tre&s;s is laid upon it, and le&s;s time con&s;umed in it. His coun&s;el, therefore, was judicious and &s;ea&s;onable; to wit, That the improvement of our rea&s;oning power is to be expected much more from an intimate acquaintance with the authors who rea&s;on be&s;t, than from &s;tudying voluminous &s;y&s;tems of logic. But if he had meant, that the &s;tudy of logic was of no u&s;e, nor de&s;erved any at|tention, he &s;urely would not have taken the pains
<PB N="261" REF="265">
to have made &s;o con&s;iderable an addition to it, by his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding,</HI> and by his <HI>Thoughts on the Conduct of the Under&s;tanding.</HI> Nor would he have remitted his pupil to Chillingworth, the acute&s;t logician, as well as the be&s;t rea&s;oner, of his age; and one who, in innumerable places of his excellent book, without pedantry even in that pedantic age, makes the happie&s;t application of the rules of logic, for unravelling the &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oning of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Our rea&s;oning power makes no appearance in infancy; but as we grow up, it unfolds it&s;elf by degrees, like the bud of a tree. When a child fir&s;t draws an inference, or perceives the force of an inference drawn by another per&s;on, we may call this <HI>the birth of his rea&s;on:</HI> but it is yet like a new-born babe, weak and tender; it mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed, and carried in arms, and have food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, till it gathers &s;trength.</P>
<P>I believe no man remembers this birth of his rea|&s;on; but it is probable that his deci&s;ions will at fir&s;t be weak and wavering; and, compared with that &s;teady conviction which he acquires in ripe years, will be like the dawn of the morning com|pared with noon-day. We &s;ee that the rea&s;on of children yields to authority, as a reed to the wind; nay, that it clings to it, and leans upon it, as if con&s;cious of its own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>When rea&s;on acquires &s;uch &s;trength as to &s;tand on its own bottom, without the aid of authority, or even in oppo&s;ition to authority, this may be called its <HI>manly age.</HI> But in mo&s;t men, it hardly ever arrives at this period. Many, by their &s;itu|ation in life, have not the opportunity of cultiva|ting their rational powers. Many from the habit they have acquired, of &s;ubmitting their opini|ons to the authority of others, or from &s;ome other principle which operates more powerfully than the
<PB N="262" REF="266">
love of truth, &s;uffer their judgment to be carried along to the end of their days, either by the au|thority of a leader, or of a party, or of the mul|titude, or by their own pa&s;&s;ions. Such per&s;ons, however learned, however acute, may be &s;aid to be all their days children in under&s;tanding. They rea&s;on, they di&s;pute, and perhaps write; but it is not that they may find the truth; but that they may defend opinions which have de&s;cended to them by inheritance, or into which they have fal|len by accident, or been led by affection.</P>
<P>I agree with Mr. Locke, that there is no &s;tudy better fitted to exerci&s;e and &s;trengthen the rea&s;on|ing powers, than that of the mathematical &s;cien|ces; for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, Becau&s;e there is no other branch of &s;cience which gives &s;uch &s;cope to long and accurate trains of rea&s;oning; and &s;econd|ly, Becau&s;e in mathematics there is no room for authority, or for prejudice of any kind, which may give a fal&s;e bias to the judgment.</P>
<P>When a youth of moderate parts begins to &s;tu|dy Euclid, every thing at fir&s;t is new to him. His apprehen&s;ion is un&s;teady; his judgment is fee|ble; and re&s;ts partly upon the evidence of the thing, and partly upon the authority of his teach|er. But every time he goes over the definitions, the axioms, the elementary propo&s;itions, more light breaks in upon him; the language becomes familiar, and conveys clear and &s;teady conceptions; the judgment is confirmed; he begins to &s;ee what demon&s;tration is; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee it without being charmed with it. He perceives it to be a kind of evidence which has no need of autho|rity to &s;trengthen it. He finds him&s;elf emancipa|ted from that bondage, and exults &s;o much in this new &s;tate of independence, that he &s;purns at au|thority, and would have demon&s;tration for every thing; until experience teaches him, that this is a
<PB N="263" REF="267">
kind of evidence which cannot be had in mo&s;t things; and that in his mo&s;t important concerns, he mu&s;t re&s;t contented with probability.</P>
<P>As he goes on in mathematics, the road of de|mon&s;trations becomes &s;mooth and ea&s;y; he can walk in it firmly, and take wider &s;teps: and, at la&s;t, he acquires the habit, not only of under|&s;tanding a demon&s;tration, but of di&s;covering and demon&s;trating mathematical truths.</P>
<P>Thus, a man without rules of logic, may ac|quire the habit of rea&s;oning ju&s;tly in mathematics; and, I believe, he may, by like means, acquire the habit of rea&s;oning ju&s;tly in mechanics, in ju|ri&s;prudence, in politics, or in any other &s;cience. Good &s;en&s;e, good examples, and a&s;&s;iduous exer|ci&s;e, may bring a man to rea&s;on ju&s;tly and acute|ly in his own profe&s;&s;ion, without rules.</P>
<P>But if any man think, that from this con|ce&s;&s;ion he may infer the inutility of logic, he be|trays a great want of that art by this inference: for it is no better rea&s;oning than this, That be|cau&s;e a man may go from Edinburgh to London by the way of Paris, therefore any other road is u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no practical art which may not be acquired, in a very con&s;iderable degree, by example and practice, without reducing it to rules. But practice, joined with rules, may carry a man on in his art farther and more quickly, than practice without rules. Every ingenious arti&s;t knows the utility of having his art reduced to rules, and by that means made a &s;cience. He is thereby enlightened in his practice, and works with more a&s;&s;urance. By rules, he &s;ometimes corrects his own errors, and often detects the er|rors of others: he finds them of great u&s;e to con|firm his judgment, to ju&s;tify what is right, and to condemn what is wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="268">
Is it of no u&s;e in rea&s;oning, to be well acquaint|ed with the various powers of the human under|&s;tanding, by which we rea&s;on? Is it of no u&s;e, to re&s;olve the various kinds of rea&s;oning into their &s;imple elements; and to di&s;cover, as far as we are able, the rules by which tho&s;e elements are com|bined in judging and in rea&s;oning? Is it of no u&s;e, to mark the various fallacies in rea&s;oning, by which even the mo&s;t ingenious men have been led into error? It mu&s;t &s;urely betray great want of under&s;tanding, to think the&s;e things u&s;ele&s;s or unimportant. The&s;e are the things which logi|cians have attempted; and which they have exe|cuted; not indeed &s;o completely as to leave no room for improvement, but in &s;uch a manner as to give very con&s;iderable aid to our rea&s;oning powers. That the principles laid down with re|gard to definition and divi&s;ion, with regard to the conver&s;ion and oppo&s;ition of propo&s;itions and the general rules of rea&s;oning, are not without u&s;e, is &s;ufficiently apparent from the blunders commit|ted by tho&s;e who di&s;dain any acquaintance with them.</P>
<P>Although the art of categorical &s;yllogi&s;m is bet|ter fitted for &s;chola&s;tic litigation, than for real im|provement in knowledge, it is a venerable piece of antiquity, and a great effort of human genius. We admire the pyramids of Egypt, and the wall of China, though u&s;ele&s;s burdens upon the earth. We can bear the mo&s;t minute de&s;cription of them, and travel hundreds of leagues to &s;ee them. If any per&s;on &s;hould, with &s;acrilegious hands, de|&s;troy or deface them, his memory would be had in abhorrence. The predicaments and predica|bles, the rules of &s;yllogi&s;m, and the topics, have a like title to our veneration as antiquities: they are uncommon efforts, not of human power, but
<PB N="265" REF="269">
of human genius; and they make a remarkable period in the progre&s;s of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The prejudice again&s;t logic has probably been &s;trengthened by its being taught too early in life. Boys are often taught logic as they are taught their creed, when it is an exerci&s;e of memory on|ly, without under&s;tanding. One may as well ex|pect to under&s;tand grammar before he can &s;peak, as to under&s;tand logic before he can rea&s;on. It mu&s;t even be acknowledged, that commonly we are capabable of rea&s;oning in mathematics more early than in logic. The objects pre&s;ented to the mind in this &s;cience, are of a very ab&s;tract nature, and can be di&s;tinctly conceived only when we are capable of attentive reflection upon the operations of our own under&s;tanding, and after we have been accu&s;tomed to rea&s;on. There may be an elementary logic, level to the capacity of tho&s;e who have been but little exerci&s;ed in rea&s;oning; but the mo&s;t important parts of this &s;cience require a ripe under&s;tanding, capable of reflecting upon its own operations. Therefore to make logic the fir&s;t branch of &s;cience that is to be taught, is an old error that ought to be corrected.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 2. <HI>Of the Improvement of Logic.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In compo&s;itions of human thought expre&s;|&s;ed by &s;peech or by writing, whatever is excel|lent and whatever is faulty, fall within the pro|vince, either of grammar, or of rhetoric, or of logic. Propriety of expre&s;&s;ion is the province of grammar; grace, elegance, and force, in thought and in expre&s;&s;ion, are the province of rhetoric; ju&s;tne&s;s and accuracy of thought are the province of logic.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="270">
The faults in compo&s;ition, therefore, which fall under the cen&s;ure of logic, are ob&s;cure and indi&s;tinct conceptions, fal&s;e judgment, inconclu|&s;ive rea&s;oning, and all improprieties in di&s;tincti|ons, definitions, divi&s;ion, or method. To aid our rational powers, in avoiding the&s;e faults and in attaining the oppo&s;ite excellencies, is the end of logic; and whatever there is in it that has no tendency to promote this end, ought to be thrown out.</P>
<P>The rules of logic being of a very ab&s;tract na|ture, ought to be illu&s;trated by a variety of real and &s;triking examples taken from the writings of good authors. It is both in&s;tructive and enter|taining, to ob&s;erve the virtues of accurate com|po&s;ition in writers of fame. We cannot &s;ee them, without being drawn to the imitation of them, in a more powerful manner than we can be by dry rules. Nor are the faults of &s;uch writers le&s;s in&s;tructive or le&s;s powerful monitors. A wreck, left upon a &s;hoal, or upon a rock, is not more u&s;eful to the &s;ailor, than the faults of good writ|ers, when &s;et up to view, are to tho&s;e who come after them. It was a happy thought in a late in|genious writer on Engli&s;h Grammar, to collect under the &s;everal rules, examples of bad Engli&s;h found in the mo&s;t approved authors. It were to be wi&s;hed that the rules of logic were illu&s;trated in the &s;ame manner. By this means, a &s;y&s;tem of logic would become a repo&s;itory; wherein what|ever is mo&s;t acute in judging and in rea&s;oning, whatever is mo&s;t accurate in dividing, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing, and defining, &s;hould be laid up and di&s;po&s;ed in order for our imitation; and wherein the fal&s;e &s;teps of eminent authors &s;hould be recorded for our admonition.</P>
<P>After men had laboured in the &s;earch of truth near two thou&s;and years, by the help of &s;yllo|gi&s;ms,
<PB N="267" REF="271">
Lord Bacon propo&s;ed the method of in|duction, as a more effectual engine, for that pur|po&s;e. His <HI>Novum Organum</HI> gave a new turn to the thoughts and labours of the inqui&s;itive, more re|markable, and more u&s;eful, than that which the <HI>Organum</HI> of Ari&s;totle had given before; and may be con&s;idered as a &s;econd grand aera in the progre&s;s of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The art of &s;yllogi&s;m produced numberle&s;s di&s;|putes, and numberle&s;s &s;ects, who fought again&s;t each other with much animo&s;ity, without gaining or lo&s;ing ground; but did nothing con&s;iderable for the benefit of human life. The art of induc|tion, fir&s;t delineated by Lord Bacon, produced numberle&s;s laboratories and ob&s;ervatories, in which Nature has been put to the que&s;tion by thou&s;ands of experiments, and forced to confe&s;s many of her &s;ecrets, which before were hid from mortals. And by the&s;e, arts have been improved, and hu|man knowledge wonderfully increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>In rea&s;oning by &s;yllogi&s;m, from general prin|ciples we de&s;cend to a conclu&s;ion virtually con|tained in them. The proce&s;s of induction is more arduous; being an a&s;cent from particular premi|&s;es to a general conclu&s;ion. The evidence of &s;uch general conclu&s;ions is not demon&s;trative, but probable: but when the induction is &s;ufficiently copious, and carried on according to the rules of art, it forces conviction no le&s;s than demon&s;trati|on it&s;elf does.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of human knowledge re&s;ts upon evidence of this kind. Indeed we can have no other for general truths which are contingent in their nature, and depend upon the will and or|dination of the Maker of the world. He governs the world he has made, by general laws. The effects of the&s;e laws in particular phenomena are open to our ob&s;ervation; and by ob&s;erving a
<PB N="268" REF="272">
train of uniform effects with due caution, we may at la&s;t decypher the law of nature by which they are regulated.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon has di&s;played no le&s;s force of ge|nius in reducing to rules this method of rea&s;oning, than Ari&s;totle did in the method of &s;yllogi&s;m. His <HI>Novum Organum</HI> ought therefore to be held as a mo&s;t important addition to the ancient logic. Tho&s;e who under&s;tand it, and enter into the &s;pi|rit of it, will be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the chaff from the wheat in philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions into the works of God. They will learn to hold in due contempt all hypothe&s;es and theories, the crea|tures of human imagination, and to re&s;pect no|thing but facts &s;ufficiently vouched, or conclu&s;i|ons drawn from them by a fair and cha&s;te inter|pretation of nature.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t arts have been reduced to rules, after they had been brought to a con&s;iderable degree of perfection by the natural &s;agacity of arti&s;ts; and the rules have been drawn from the be&s;t ex|amples of the art that had been before exhibited: but the art of philo&s;ophical induction was deli|neated by Lord Bacon in a very ample manner, before the world had &s;een any tolerable example of it. This, although it adds greatly to the merit of the author, mu&s;t have produced &s;ome ob&s;curi|ty in the work, and a defect of proper examples for illu&s;tration. This defect may now be ea&s;ily &s;upplied, from tho&s;e authors who, in their philo|&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions, have mo&s;t &s;trictly pur&s;u|ed the path pointed out in the <HI>Novum Organum,</HI> Among the&s;e Sir I&s;aac Newton &s;eems to hold the fir&s;t rank, having, in the third book of his <HI>Princi|pia,</HI> and in his Optics, had the rules of the <HI>No|vum Organum</HI> con&s;tantly in his eye.</P>
<P>I think Lord Bacon was al&s;o the fir&s;t who en|deavoured to reduce to a &s;y&s;tem the prejudices or
<PB N="269" REF="273">
bia&s;&s;es of the mind, which are the cau&s;es of fal&s;e judgment, and which he calls <HI>the idols of the hu|man under&s;tanding.</HI> Some late writers of logic have very properly introduced this into their &s;y&s;tem; but it de&s;erves to be more copiou&s;ly handled, and to be illu&s;trated by real examples.</P>
<P>It is of great con&s;equence to accurate rea&s;oning, to di&s;tingui&s;h fir&s;t principles which are to be ta|ken for granted, from propo&s;itions which require proof. All the real knowledge of mankind may be divided into two parts: the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions; the &s;econd, of tho&s;e which are deduced by ju&s;t rea&s;oning from &s;elf-evi|dent propo&s;itions. The line which divides the&s;e two parts ought to be marked as di&s;tinctly as po&s;|&s;ible, and the principles that are &s;elf-evident re|duced, as far as can be done, to general axioms. This has been done in mathematics from the be|ginning, and has tended greatly to the emolument of that &s;cience. It has lately been done in natu|ral philo&s;ophy: and by this means that &s;cience has advanced more in an hundred and fifty years, than it had done before in two thou&s;and. Every &s;ci|ence is in an unformed &s;tate until its fir&s;t principles are a&s;certained: after that is done, it advances re|gularly, and &s;ecures the ground it has gained.</P>
<P>Although fir&s;t principles do not admit of direct proof, yet there mu&s;t be certain marks and cha|racters, by which tho&s;e that are truly &s;uch may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from counterfeits. The&s;e marks ought to be de&s;cribed, and applied, to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine from the &s;purious.</P>
<P>In the ancient philo&s;ophy there is a redundance, rather than a defect, of fir&s;t principles. Many things were a&s;&s;umed under that character without a ju&s;t title: That nature abhors a <HI>vacuum;</HI> That bodies do not gravitate in their proper place; That the heavenly bodies undergo no change;
<PB N="270" REF="274">
That they move in perfect circles, and with an equable motion. Such principles as the&s;e were a&s;&s;umed in the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy, without proof, as if they were &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>Des Cartes, &s;en&s;ible of this weakne&s;s in the ancient philo&s;ophy, and de&s;irous to guard again&s;t it in his own &s;y&s;tem, re&s;olved to admit nothing until his a&s;&s;ent was forced by irre&s;i&s;tible evidence. The fir&s;t thing which he found to be certain and evident was, that he thought, and rea&s;oned, and doubted. He found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of believing the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e operations of mind of which he was con&s;cious: and having thus found &s;ure footing in this one principle of con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s, he re&s;ted &s;atisfied with it, hoping to be able to build the whole fabric of his knowledge upon it; like Archimedes, who wanted but one fixed point to move the whole earth. But the foundation was too narrow; and in his progre&s;s he unawares a&s;&s;umes many things le&s;s evident than tho&s;e which he attempts to prove. Although he was not able to &s;u&s;pect the te&s;timony of con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, yet he thought the te&s;timony of &s;en&s;e, of me|mory, and of every other faculty, might be &s;u&s;|pected, and ought not to be received until proof was brought that they are not fallacious. Therefore he applies the&s;e faculties, who&s;e character is yet in que&s;tion, to prove, That there is an infinitely perfect Being who made him, and who made his &s;en&s;es, his memory, his rea&s;on, and all his faculties; That this Being is no deceiver, and therefore could not give him faculties that are fallacious; and that on this account they de&s;erve credit.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange, that this philo&s;opher, who found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the te&s;ti|mony of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, did not find the &s;ame ne|ce&s;&s;ity of yielding to the te&s;timony of his &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="271" REF="275">
his memory, and his under&s;tanding: and that while he was certain that he doubted, and rea&s;on|ed, he was uncertain whether two and three made five, and whether he was dreaming or awake. It is more &s;trange, that &s;o acute a rea&s;oner &s;hould not perceive, that his whole train of rea&s;oning to prove that his faculties were not fallacious, was mere &s;ophi&s;try: for if his faculties were falla|cious, they might deceive him in this train of rea&s;oning; and &s;o the conclu&s;ion, That they were not fallacious, was only the te&s;timony of his faculties in their own favour, and might be a fallacy.</P>
<P>It is difficult to give any rea&s;on for di&s;tru&s;ting our other faculties, that will not reach con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s it&s;elf. And he who di&s;tru&s;ts tho&s;e faculties of judging and rea&s;oning which God hath given him, mu&s;t even re&s;t in his &s;ceptici&s;m till he come to a &s;ound mind, or until God give him new fa|culties to &s;it in judgment upon the old. If it be not a fir&s;t principle, That our faculties are not fallacious, we mu&s;t be ab&s;olute &s;ceptics: for this principle is incapable of proof; and if it is not certain, nothing el&s;e can be certain.</P>
<P>Since the time of Des Cartes, it has been fa&s;hionable with tho&s;e who dealt in ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, to employ their invention in find|ing philo&s;ophical arguments, either to prove tho&s;e truths which ought to be received as fir&s;t principles, or to overturn them: and it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, whether the authority of fir&s;t prin|ciples is more hurt by the fir&s;t of the&s;e attempts, or by the la&s;t; for &s;uch principles can &s;tand &s;ecure only upon their own bottom; and to place them upon any other foundation than that of their intrin&s;ic evidence, is in effect to overturn them.</P>

I have lately met with a very &s;en&s;ible and judi|cious treati&s;e, wrote by Father Buffier about fifty years ago, concerning fir&s;t principles, and the &s;ource of human judgments, which, with great propriety, he prefixed to his treati&s;e of logic. And indeed I apprehend it is a &s;ubject of &s;uch con|&s;equence, that if inqui&s;itive men can be brought to the &s;ame unanimity in the fir&s;t principles of the other &s;ciences, as in tho&s;e of mathematics and natural philo&s;ophy, (and why &s;hould we de&s;pair of a general agreement in things that are &s;elf-evident?), this might be con&s;idered as a third grand aera in the progre&s;s of human rea&s;on.</P>
