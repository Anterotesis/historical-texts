<P>THE fir&s;t volume of this work was printed off in the life-time of the author; the &s;econd after his death, the whole of the copy being put into the hands of the publi&s;her long before that period. The de&s;ign of the author is evidently to give a &s;hort view of Experi|mental Philo&s;ophy in its pre&s;ent improved &s;tate; for which it is indebted principally to the phi|lo&s;ophers of the la&s;t century, who have done more towards it, than had been attempted for whole ages before. The ancients, &s;atisfied with the facts which na|ture &s;pontaneou&s;ly offered, went no farther than to a bare natural hi&s;tory, unacquainted as they
<PB REF="5">
were with the manner of combi|ning natural bodies, &s;o as from this combination to produce new phaenomena, and of putting them in &s;uch circum&s;tances as to force them to reveal their &s;ecrets. Our author having ob&s;erved, that <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> rai&s;ed this &s;pirit of enquiry, and diffu&s;ed an un|common degree of emulation all over Europe, proceeds to con|&s;ider matter, the common &s;ub|&s;tratum of bodies, and its &s;en&s;ible qualities; &s;uch as &s;olidity, by which one body cannot at the &s;ame time occupy the room of another, the con&s;equence of the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> or power of re&s;i&s;t|ance, called al&s;o impenetra|bility, and by which we di&s;tin|gui&s;h matter from a thinking
<PB REF="6">
being, which is endued with a con&s;tant tendency to change &s;pontaneou&s;ly its &s;tate, the very rever&s;e of inactivity. The moving force in bodies is equally with their inactivity a pa&s;&s;ive quality, and a con&s;equence of their re&s;i&s;tance, and therefore the &s;ame thing with it, only con&s;idered in a different view. Attraction, or the tendency of matter to matter, &s;eems to be the effect of &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, rather than an inherent quality in matter; different &s;pe|cies of which are magneti&s;m and electricity: in which, that repul&s;ion, which is ob&s;ervable, &s;eems to be owing to a recipro|cation of the motion of the cau&s;e of both the&s;e phaenomena. To
<PB REF="7">
the&s;e we may add gravity, the tendency of a body to the centre of another. From motion ari&s;es the divi&s;ibility of a body, which by means of art may be carried to great lengths.&mdash;To follow our author through the diffe|rent branches of experimental philo&s;ophy, would carry us too far, and much exceed the limits of an adverti&s;ement. The reader will find his account in the pe|ru&s;al, and meet with &s;ome things new and uncommon, which are not unworthy the author, nor the attention of the Public.</P>

<HEAD><PB REF="12">A SURVEY OF EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P>IN order to explain all the appearances of Nature, the ancients u&s;ually con|&s;idered man as a Being newly introduced into the world, ignorant of all he &s;aw, and a&s;toni&s;hed with every object around him. In this great variety, the fir&s;t efforts of &s;uch a Being would be to pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and, carele&s;s of the cau&s;es of things, to re&s;t contented with their enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="13">THE next endeavour of &s;uch a crea|ture would be to know by what means he became ble&s;t with &s;uch a luxuriance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He feels the grateful vici&s;&s;i|tudes of day and night, perceives the dif|ference of &s;ea&s;ons; he finds &s;ome things noxious to his health, and others grateful to his appetite; he would therefore eagerly de&s;ire to be informed how the&s;e things a&s;&s;umed &s;uch qualities, and would him&s;elf, from want of experience, form &s;ome wild conjecture concerning them. He would, for in&s;tance, a&s;&s;ert, as the primaeval ancients have done, that the &s;un was made of red-hot iron, that at night it &s;unk into the &s;ea to re&s;t from its journey, that &s;ummer i&s;&s;ued through a cha&s;m made in the &s;kies for that pur|po&s;e; and in this manner he would account for every other appearance that excited his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>SUCCEEDING ob&s;ervations would, however, &s;oon contradict his fir&s;t pre|judices, and he would begin to trea&s;ure up an hi&s;tory of the changes, that every
<PB N="3" REF="14">
object &s;erved to work either upon him|&s;elf or upon each other. Thus his mind would become &s;tored with the appear|ances of natural bodies, and with u&s;eful ob&s;ervations upon their effects. The number of the&s;e ob&s;ervations would in time ari&s;e to a con&s;iderable amount, and this would once more induce him to reduce them into form; and, by com|bining them, to arrive at their cau&s;es. From hence new &s;y&s;tems would be erected, more plau&s;ible indeed than tho&s;e already made by &s;avage man, but &s;till, from a want of a &s;ufficient number of materials, extremely defective: &s;o that fancy would be obliged to &s;upply the greate&s;t &s;hare of the fabric.</P>
<P>AT length, after frequently experi|encing the futility of &s;y&s;tem, man would be obliged to acknowledge his ignorance of the cau&s;es of mo&s;t appearances, and now, grown more mode&s;t, would &s;et him&s;elf down, not only to collect new ob&s;ervations, in order to enlarge his hi&s;tory of Nature, but in a manner to
<PB N="4" REF="15">
torture Nature by <HI>Experiments,</HI> and oblige her to give up tho&s;e &s;ecrets, which &s;he had hitherto kept concealed. Several of the&s;e newly-acquired ob&s;ervations being thus added to the former obvious amount, would at length form the ground-work of a &s;y&s;tem, and, by comparing each part, and uniting the whole, man would at la&s;t begin to di&s;cover the &s;implicity of Nature under all her &s;eeming variety.</P>
<P>SUCH is the progre&s;s of natural phi|lo&s;ophy in the human mind, which, from enjoyment, proceeds to <HI>conjecture</HI>; from thence to <HI>ob&s;ervation of facts,</HI> which from their paucity give birth to <HI>hypothetical</HI> &s;y&s;tem, which is &s;ucceeded by experimental inve&s;tigation, and this at length gives ri&s;e to the true <HI>Experi|mental</HI> &s;y&s;tem, which, though &s;till defec|tive, is yet built upon the &s;ure&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENTAL philo&s;ophers there|fore, or tho&s;e who endeavour to di&s;cover the hidden operations of Nature, and find out new properties by trials made
<PB N="5" REF="16">
upon her, are the only &s;ect, from whom any expectations are to be had of advancing this &s;cience, and making us intimately acquainted with whatever we &s;ee. We &s;hould leave to the Platoni&s;ts their properties of number and geome|trical figures; to the Peripatetics their privations, elementary virtues, occult qualities, &s;ympathies, antipathies, and faculties; to the Mechani&s;ts their mat|ter, motion, &s;ubtile particles, and actions of effluvia, and only follow where Expe|rience &s;hall guide us.</P>
<P>THE ancients &s;eem to have been but little acquainted with the arts of making experiments for the inve&s;tigation of na|tural knowledge. It is true, they trea|&s;ured up numberle&s;s ob&s;ervations, which Nature offered to their view, or which chance might have given them an op|portunity of &s;eeing; but they &s;eldom went further than barely the natural hi&s;tory of every object: they &s;eldom la|boured, by variou&s;ly combining natural bodies, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, to <HI>create</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="17">
new appearances, in order to afford matter for &s;peculation.</P>
<P>THEY were but little employed in thus diving into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of Nature: they read the book as it lay before them; but then they read with great a&s;&s;iduity. Many facts, which they have advanced, and which had at fir&s;t been denied by the moderns, have been afterwards found to be true. They only &s;ought for &s;uch qualities in Nature as might be u&s;eful to the arts. Little concerned as to &s;atisfying mere curio&s;ity, they con&s;idered it as an intellectual plea|&s;ure, and only &s;ought to gratify it by mere intellectual &s;peculations.</P>
<P>BUT whatever a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might have given to real philo&s;ophy, the ob&s;cure ages, which &s;ucceeded theirs, &s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to avail them&s;elves of their re&s;earches. In the&s;e times of darkne&s;s, they re&s;ted perfectly &s;atisfied with words in&s;tead of things, adopted the vain &s;pe|culations of antiquity, and added many
<PB N="7" REF="18">
more of their own. Yet, in the mid&s;t of this barbarous period, there aro&s;e a man, who &s;eemed formed to enlighten his cotemporaries, if the darkne&s;s had not been too great for any &s;ingle lumi|nary to di&s;pel. <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> and a monk of the twelfth century, pur&s;ued the true method of inve&s;tigating Nature: he even ventured to ridicule the unmeaning philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> or rather of his commentators; made &s;everal experiments in optics, chemi&s;try, and every part of natural knowledge, and, even at that early period, found out the u&s;e of gun-powder. The only recom|pence he had from his ignorant cotem|poraries was to be accu&s;ed of magic, and to have his works de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;uch as never read them, or were incapable of comprehending them if they had.</P>
<P>THE remarkable men, who &s;ucceeded <HI>Bacon</HI> in the pur&s;uit of natural know|ledge, &s;tudied it rather as chemi&s;ts than philo&s;ophers: they applied them&s;elves to the analy&s;ation of particular bodies
<PB N="8" REF="19">
by fire, and to their u&s;es in medicine, rather than to con&s;ider Nature with a general view, to the di&s;covery of the laws of her operations. Though they were rich in a variety of curious and u&s;eful di&s;coveries, yet they knew no|thing, for in&s;tance, of the laws of motion, or the properties of fluids, upon a knowledge of which the whole &s;y&s;tem of modern philo&s;ophy is founded.</P>
<P>THE great man, to whom experi|mental philo&s;ophy next owed its obli|gations, was of the &s;ame name and the &s;ame country with the former. <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> fir&s;t di&s;covered the general principles, which were to &s;erve as guides in the &s;tudy of Nature. He fir&s;t propo&s;ed the u&s;efulne&s;s of experi|ments alone, and hinted at &s;everal, which others afterwards made with &s;uc|ce&s;s. He &s;et out with taking a general &s;urvey of natural knowledge, divided it into its parts, enquired into the degree of perfection at that time attained by each. He con&s;idered philo&s;ophy as only
<PB N="9" REF="20">
an in&s;trument, which made us better or happier, and an enemy to all &s;y&s;tems, exhorted men to &s;tudy only what was u&s;eful. This great man having thus broke through many of the chains, in which true &s;cience was bound, was &s;till deterred from attempting others, which prejudice and authority &s;eemed to fa&s;ten.</P>
<P>IN this Review of Experimental Phi|lo&s;ophy, <HI>Des Cartes</HI> mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over, although mentioned rather for his fame than his &s;ervices. He contributed not a little to explode the errors of &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy; but, unfortunately, it was to &s;ub&s;titute his own. Though he was very capable of rea&s;oning clo&s;ely, yet, to accommodate his philo&s;ophy to the multitude, he drew up rather a ro|mance than a &s;y&s;tem. Like all works that &s;trike the imagination, it plea&s;ed while new; but, wanting the ba&s;is of rea&s;on, the whole fabric has long &s;ince fallen to the ground. As his hypothe&s;is, however, has been once embraced by the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;till con|tinues
<PB N="10" REF="21">
to have its parti&s;ans, it may not be ami&s;s to give the learner a &s;uperficial idea of it.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands acknowledged, that the mo&s;t obvious appearances in Nature are tho&s;e which are lea&s;t under&s;tood. Why, for in&s;tance, a &s;tone, when thrown upward, &s;hould fall to the ground back again, and not continue to go up to the &s;kies, is one of tho&s;e difficulties, which, though di&s;regarded by the vulgar, has puzzled the philo&s;ophers of every age. To expre&s;s it more philo&s;ophically, the de&s;cent of bodies to the &s;urface of the earth is a phaenomenon long &s;ought after without &s;ucce&s;s, and for the cau&s;e of which <HI>Des Cartes</HI> thus attempted to account. We are certain from a&s;trono|mical ob&s;ervations, &s;ays he, that the earth turns continually round upon it&s;elf, like a top, with a very rapid motion, carrying with it every thing immedi|ately attached to its &s;urface. But, tho' the earth thus moves with great &s;wift|ne&s;s, yet there is diffu&s;ed around it a
<PB N="11" REF="22">
very &s;ubtle matter, which, as it has le&s;s weight than the earth, has therefore much greater velocity, the lighte&s;t bodies being the mo&s;t ea&s;ily moved: &s;o that this &s;ubtil matter whirls round the earth in|finitely fa&s;ter than the earth it&s;elf can move. If therefore a &s;tone is thrown from the earth's &s;urface upward into this &s;ubtle matter, it mu&s;t &s;oon be pre&s;t downward by it to the earth again, in the &s;ame manner as if a per&s;on, in the mid&s;t of a whirlpool, &s;hould throw a plank from him into the &s;urrounding current, this plank would be &s;oon driven back to him in the center again by the circulating fluid, and he could never by &s;uch means get free. In this way every one of the planets may be con&s;idered with its vortex or whirlpool of &s;ubtil matter turning round it, and pre&s;&s;ing all the bodies that are thrown upward back upon its &s;urface. Be&s;ides the&s;e particular vortexes in which each moved, they were repre&s;ented as having altogether one common vortex, which regulated their motions, and in this
<PB N="12" REF="23">
manner all their revolutions were in the gro&s;s accounted for. An hypothe&s;is thus formed by the fancy was liable to a thou&s;and objections, which were drawn from experience. Each of the&s;e, the followers of <HI>Des Cartes</HI> endeavoured to an&s;wer, till at length the whole philo|&s;ophical machine was found &s;o much clogged, that it became utterly di&s;re|garded by its warme&s;t a&s;&s;erters: they therefore quitted a fortre&s;s, which they found could be a&s;&s;ailed on every &s;ide with advantage.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding all his errors, he diffu&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion for natural know|ledge, and excited a &s;pirit of enquiry, which in&s;en&s;ibly &s;pread it&s;elf over <HI>Europe.</HI> The academy of <HI>Cimento</HI> at <HI>Florence, Boyle, Mariotte, Torricelli, Huygens,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;cal,</HI> all improved philo&s;ophy by pro|ducing new objects of &s;peculation. The &s;ocieties of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> &s;till farther enlarged the land-marks of the &s;cience, and adopted the experimental methods of inve&s;tigating Nature. Though they
<PB N="13" REF="24">
had not yet arrived at the true &s;y&s;tem of Nature, yet they might ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be on the road.</P>
<P>AT length <HI>Newton</HI> appeared, who fir&s;t effected what his predece&s;&s;ors had hitherto only aimed at; namely, the application of geometry to Nature, and, by uniting experiments with mathema|tical calculations, di&s;covered new laws of Nature, in a manner at once preci&s;e, profound, and amazing. Whatever all his predece&s;&s;ors, from time immemorial, had handed down concerning this &s;cience, does not amount to the tenth part of the di&s;coveries of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> philo&s;o|pher only. Equally con&s;picuous for his re&s;earches in optics, as for his &s;y&s;tem of the world, he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his countrymen at once &s;eize the truths he revealed to mankind. <HI>France,</HI> for &s;ome years, rather through national prejudice than philo&s;ophical conviction, oppo&s;ed his fame, and in their academies and univer&s;ities continued to teach the opinions of their countryman <HI>Des Cartes.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="25">
Truth however at length prevailed, the cotemporaries of <HI>Newton,</HI> who might have oppo&s;ed his merits from envy, being decea&s;ed, the &s;ucceeding generation adopted his di&s;coveries, and his &s;y&s;tem now prevails in every polite part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THUS far we have &s;een experimental philo&s;ophy continuing to improve; but it will be but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Newton</HI> have not &s;ince his time made that rapid progre&s;s in this &s;cience that was once expected. This judicious philo&s;opher knew preci&s;ely tho&s;e parts of Nature, which admitted of ge|ometrical applications. Nothing could be more happily conceived than his applying mathematical calculations to the heavenly bodies, upon which no natural experiments could be made, and the greatne&s;s of who&s;e bulks and di|&s;tances could more ea&s;ily be mea&s;ured by numbers, and conceal the minute devi|ations of Nature from univer&s;al theorems.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="26">HIS followers, much le&s;s judicious, have expected more from geometry than the art could grant, and, by erroneous imitation, have applied it to parts of Nature, which are incapable of admit|ting mathematical calculations. Thus we have &s;een the force of mu&s;cular motion determined by numbers, the velocity with which the blood circulates calcu|lated with geometrical preci&s;ion, the fermentation of liquors has undergone the &s;ame &s;crutiny, and the mo&s;t incon|&s;tant appearances of Nature have been determined with inflexible demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>IT would be ab&s;urd to deny the great u&s;e of geometry in natural enquiries; but &s;ure it may be &s;aid, without offence, that mathematicians expect more from its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than they have been hitherto able to find. If we expect to make di&s;|coveries in Nature merely by the helps of geometry, it is probable we &s;hall be di&s;appointed, as this art is rather fitted to give preci&s;ion to di&s;coveries already
<PB N="16" REF="27">
made, than to conduct us to new. Though it may &s;erve as a vehicle, through which to deliver our di&s;coveries to others, yet it is &s;eldom by this method that we have happened upon them our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, it is rather to accidental experiments, than to pain|ful inductions, that we are indebted for the modern di&s;coveries in this &s;cience. Electricity, magneti&s;m, and congelation, have been rather the re&s;ult of accident than of inve&s;tigation. Of the&s;e we know but &s;ome of the properties, nor have we any &s;ub&s;tantial theory as yet concerning them. In fact, mankind at la&s;t begin to perceive, that our knowledge of Na|ture is much more limited than we lately imagined it to be. In the la&s;t age it was fa&s;hionable to &s;uppo&s;e, that we could &s;atisfactorily account for every appear|ance around us: at pre&s;ent, the real philo&s;opher &s;eems to re&s;t &s;atisfied, that there is much in this &s;cience yet to be di&s;covered, and that what he already
<PB N="17" REF="28">
knows bears no proportion to what re|mains unknown. He no longer there|fore pretends to a&s;&s;ign cau&s;es for all things, but waits till time, indu&s;try, or accident &s;hall bring new lights to guide the enquiry.</P>

<P>LET us for a moment compare this univer&s;e to a palace, erected by the divine Architect, and the unphilo&s;ophical &s;pectator to a foreigner, who &s;ees but the external part of the building.

<P><PB N="18" REF="29">IN the &s;ame manner the beauties of Nature &s;trike our view, we find our cu|rio&s;ity allured by a variety of objects. Animals, vegetables, minerals, air, wa|ter, and fire, all put on different appear|ances to plea&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;t or a&s;toni&s;h us; in order to come at a knowledge of their nature we mu&s;t approach them clo&s;ely; we mu&s;t fir&s;t con&s;ider each as dive&s;ted of all their accidental qualities of figure and colour, and turn from Nature's external ornaments to view her internal &s;im|plicity.</P>
<P>IN this &s;earch, the fir&s;t thing we find is <HI>Matter,</HI> that inert &s;ub&s;tance which &s;erves as the foundation of all bodies, and which, while it&s;elf is un&s;een, gives ex|i&s;tence to all other qualities that &s;trike the &s;en&s;es. Of this all bodies have been originally compo&s;ed, and it is probable that whatever different forms things may a&s;&s;ume either in earth, air, fire, or water, yet matter is alike &s;imple in all, and that every part of nature is compo&s;ed from &s;imilar materials.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="30">HOWEVER this be, certain it is, that no efforts of ours can make any alterations in matter, though we ea&s;ily can in the &s;en&s;ible qualities with which it is cloath|ed. We may, for in&s;tance, de&s;troy the figure and colour of a globe of gold, and di&s;&s;olve it into a fluid like water, yet &s;till every part of matter in it remains un|changed, and fills up as much &s;pace as before. If we &s;hould attempt to force any other body into the place it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the united &s;trength of millions would not be able to prevail till it&s;elf were re|moved, to give the forcing body admi&s;|&s;ion. If the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as air or water, be fixed between our hands, the&s;e cannot be brought to touch, till the air or water find a vent on one &s;ide or another. The academy of <HI>Florence</HI> having enclo&s;ed water in a globe of gold, pre&s;&s;ed it by the extreme force of &s;crews on every &s;ide.

<P>ANOTHER property which cannot be &s;eparated from mere matter, is its <HI>in|activity,</HI> or that incapacity it has to move of it&s;elf, or to &s;top its own motion. It is true, we may ea&s;ily put one body into motion, which may communicate the &s;ame to another, which may commu|nicate to a third, and &s;o on; yet &s;till this matter is perfectly inactive, it only goes forward with the force impre&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t by our&s;elves, and whatever motion it may communicate, it lo&s;es &s;o much of its own. No art, however, can give it a power of creating or generating new motion; a &s;tone till removed will continue to lie inertly on the ground, and if thrown forward will continue to move forward till the air or &s;ome other ob&s;tacle hinders it from proceeding. If there had been nothing to &s;top its motion, it would continue to go on for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32">AS we are capable of giving <HI>Motion</HI> to matter, &s;o al&s;o are we able to divide it; for <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> is, properly &s;peaking, only the moving of one part away from another. This <HI>Divi&s;ibility</HI> may be carried to great lengths by art: a &s;ingle grain of mu&s;k &s;hall &s;o divide its parts as to fill a whole room with its odour, and yet lo&s;e but little of its weight in the expe|riment; a &s;ingle grain of gold &s;hall cover a &s;urface of thirty yards &s;quare; a &s;ingle grain of copper &s;hall give a beau|tiful blue tincture to many millions of times its own quantity of water. Thus matter is extremely divi&s;ible; and after all, when the arti&s;t is thus fatigued with dividing a body into minute parts, the imagination can ea&s;ily take up the ta&s;k, and continue the operation without ever coming to an end.</P>
<P>LET us then call <HI>&s;olidity, inactivity,</HI> the <HI>capacity of receiving motion,</HI> and <HI>divi|&s;ibility,</HI> properties of matter of which it can never be deprived; properties which we mention here rather for the &s;ake of

for I can feel, move, and divide a piece of wax or an apple, though there were no other in the world. But, be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another property of matter le&s;s obvious, and which, though re&s;iding in every part of body &s;ingly, yet cannot be made known to us, but by the opera|tion of one body upon another. The property I mean is <HI>Attraction,</HI> or that power by which we &s;ee one body ap|proach another, without any apparent force impelling it. Thus we &s;ee motes and &s;traws, of them&s;elves, fly to amber or &s;ealing-wax, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; we &s;ee iron move towards the load&s;tone, and water to gla&s;s. What it is that thus impells the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances to approach each other, or in other words, what it is that cau&s;es this attraction between them, re|mains a &s;ecret that human &s;agacity has not yet di&s;covered; we are certain of the fact, we &s;ee plainly that the &s;ub&s;tances do approach, and all that we can a&s;&s;ign as the cau&s;e of their coming thus together is but conjecture.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="35">IT may be a&s;&s;erted, for in&s;tance, as the cau&s;e of this, that there is an extremely &s;ubtil fluid, much thinner than air, which is diffu&s;ed throughout the uni|ver&s;e, and even enters the pores of the harde&s;t bodies. This being granted, it follows, that &s;uch parts of this fluid as are thus &s;trained through hard &s;ub&s;tances, mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily much finer, and more &s;ubtil, than tho&s;e parts of this fluid which are diffu&s;ed into &s;paces le&s;s crowded with matter; as the liquor that is filtered through the pores of a marble rock, mu&s;t be much finer than that which is unfiltered. Wherever this fluid is mo&s;t den&s;e, therefore, it will drive all &s;olid bo|dies towards tho&s;e places, where they find the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; namely, where the fluid is lea&s;t den&s;e; that is, to the &s;urfaces of the harde&s;t bodies; and the particles of this fluid being al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed ela&s;tic, its impelling force will be increa&s;ed to what degree the imagination thinks pro|per to give it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36">IT was thus that <HI>Newton</HI> attempted to explain this appearance in nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Optic, p. 325.</NOTE>, a me|thod of accounting for things, perhaps, originally borrowed from <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> and which wants only to have the exi&s;tence of a &s;ubtil fluid proved, to make it bear the re&s;emblance of truth. In fact, in other parts of his works, he &s;eems to lay no &s;tre&s;s upon this theory, and a&s;&s;erts, that a body attracted, is drawn in propor|tion to the quantity of matter it contain|ed; while bodies impelled by a fluid, are driven with more or le&s;s force in propor|tion to their &s;urfaces.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Magnet or Load-&s;tone, with the attraction of Magneti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>THE power which the load-&s;tone has of attracting iron, or of one load-&s;tone attracting another, has excited the admiration of every age; and even induced &s;ome of the ancients to a&s;&s;ert, that it was an animated &s;ub&s;tance. <HI>Ari&s;|totle</HI> a&s;&s;ures us that <HI>Thales,</HI> the mo&s;t an|cient philo&s;opher of <HI>Greece,</HI> made men|tion of it, and <HI>Hippocrates</HI> &s;peaks of it under the title of <HI>the &s;tone which attracts iron. Pliny</HI> was &s;truck with the wonders of its attractive qualities, which was all the ancients knew of it, and thus finely exclaimed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quid lapidis rigore pigrius? Ecce &s;en&s;us ma|nu&s;que tribuit illi natura. Quid ferri duritie pugnacius? Sed cedit &amp; patitur moves: Tratutur namque a magnete lapide domitriaeque illa rerum omnium materia ad innane ne&s;cio quid currit. <HI>Plin.</HI> l. 36, cap. 16.</NOTE>, <HI>What can be more rigid,
<PB N="27" REF="38">
and inactive than &s;tone? Yet, for all this, nature has granted it &s;en&s;e, and power? What can be more ob&s;tinate than the hard|ne&s;s of iron? Yet it is brought to obedience, and becomes tractable. For it is com|manded by the load-&s;tone, and that &s;ub|&s;tance, which conquers all things, flies to &s;omething, I know not what, incorporeal.</HI> In fact, the&s;e powers might well excite &s;urprize, they were inexplicable from the beginning to this day, and remain &s;o: po&s;terity, in&s;tead of being able by experi|ment, to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e, have only by the &s;earch, found out new wonders equally inexplicable; therefore all that now remains, is rather to &s;um up the qualities of the load-&s;tone, than to ac|count for them.</P>
<P>EVERY load-&s;tone hath two poles, in which, the greate&s;t &s;hare of its magnetic or attractive virtue re&s;ides. The&s;e poles, or oppo&s;ite points, may be found out by rolling the load-&s;tone in the filings of iron, by which the filings will be &s;oon &s;een to adhere to the poles, in greater
<PB N="28" REF="39">
abundance, than to the other parts; and though it be broke into a thou&s;and pieces, yet each part of it &s;hall &s;till have its poles, as before.</P>
<P>THESE two parts of the load-&s;tone have received their name from the two poles of the earth, and like them, one is called the north, and the other the &s;outh pole. Nor are the&s;e terms applied arbi|trarily; for they have a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible affinity with the poles of the globe, who&s;e names they bear. A load-&s;tone, &s;o con|trived as to float upon &s;mooth water, (which may ea&s;ily be done by making it with a broad &s;urface) will have its poles always directed, each to its kindred pole of our earth; one to the north, and the other to the &s;outh. And if they be turned never &s;o often, &s;o as to make them point in different directions, yet the in|&s;tant this external force is taken away, they will recover their former po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THIS polar direction was utterly un|known to the ancients, but has by the
<PB N="29" REF="40">
moderns been converted to the mo&s;t u&s;eful and amazing purpo&s;es. For another pro|perty of the load-&s;tone is, that it com|municates its virtues to iron, merely by rubbing; and converts it, to all intents and purpo&s;es, into a magnet like it&s;elf, with all the &s;ame attractive properties. A piece of iron, thus impregnated with the magnetic power, and nicely &s;u&s;pended on a &s;harp point, &s;o as to le&s;&s;en the friction, and to give it the greater advantage of playing and turning in every direction, becomes what is called the <HI>mariner's needle,</HI> and will be &s;een to &s;ettle it&s;elf in a direction nearly north and &s;outh. I &s;carcely need ob&s;erve, how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch an in&s;trument mu&s;t be in directing mariners in long voyages; and it was for want of it, that the ancients were obliged to coa&s;t along in their cour&s;es from one country to another; and &s;eldom ventured to leave &s;ight of land.</P>
<P>BUT though load-&s;tones, or iron im|pregnated with magneti&s;m, have a &s;trong
<PB N="30" REF="41">
attractive force upon each other, yet they have a repul&s;ive force al&s;o; for if we &s;hould attempt to make the two north poles, of two different magnets, approach each other, we &s;hould &s;oon perceive them to fly off with &s;ome violence, as if afraid of the touch; and in the &s;ame manner al&s;o, would the two &s;outh poles repell each other: &s;o that in fact, two magnets only attract mutually, by the poles of different denominations; that is, the north pole of the former, will attract only the &s;outh pole of the latter; and the north pole of this, in turn, will have the &s;ame influence upon the &s;outh pole of the other. But two poles of the &s;ame name, like two men of the &s;ame trade, are ever at enmity, and repell each other.</P>
<P>IT is for this rea&s;on, therefore, when a magnetic virtue is to be communicated to iron, that the &s;outh pole in the load-&s;tone, ever gives a north pole to the im|pregnated body; as we &s;ee, for in&s;tance, that end of the mariner's needle, which is touched by the &s;outh pole of the &s;tone,
<PB N="31" REF="42">
always points northward. There is therefore &s;omewhat friendly and &s;ym|pathetic, between the two poles of dif|ferent denominations. Univer&s;ally, when artificial magnets are made by rubbing, each pole in the making magnet, begets its &s;ympathetic pole of a different name in the newly made magnet. And when two magnets are left to remain together, they &s;hould always be placed with their &s;ympathetic, or oppo&s;ite poles together, like pins that lie head to point, and this rather encrea&s;es their energy; whereas, if they lie with their di&s;agreeing &s;imilar poles together, their power will be wea|kened, and at la&s;t totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THE finene&s;s of the&s;e magnetic effluvia is &s;uch, that they pervade the harde&s;t bo|dies; a magnet attracting iron, though gla&s;s, gold, water, or any other &s;ub&s;tance be interpo&s;ed between them, and equally operating, <HI>in vacuo,</HI> as in open air. There is a curious method of rendering the directions of the&s;e effluvia vi&s;ible. Strew &s;ome &s;teel filings over a &s;heet of
<PB N="32" REF="43">
white paper, and underneath, let a mag|net be placed; then gently tap the paper with the finger, or otherwi&s;e, &s;o as to give the filings a little motion, and they will &s;oon be &s;een to form a regular &s;triated figure upon the paper; as repre&s;ented in the diagram. (See plate I.) From the regularity of the figure, which the&s;e efflu|via a&s;&s;ume, &s;ome have been of opinion, that the earth it&s;elf is one great magnet, &s;ending forth effluvia in the &s;ame man|ner; and that all magnetic bodies, lying in the current of the&s;e, a&s;&s;ume a polar direction: as a piece of timber, carried down a rapid &s;tream, generally floats lengthwi&s;e.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, we find by experi|ence, that the poles of a magnet do not point exactly north and &s;outh, but de|viate a little from this direction; &s;o that the mariner's needle often points &s;ome degrees away from the north pole. This is called the needle's variation; which, at different times, is greater or le&s;s in the &s;ame place, and often different in cold

weather from what it is in hot. This is one of tho&s;e phaenomena, which has long employed human &s;agacity to no purpo&s;e; the hypothe&s;is even of the late Doctor <HI>Halley</HI> him&s;elf, being no longer treated with e&s;teem. He was of opinion, that the globe of the earth had four magnetic poles, and that the needle turned to which ever of tho&s;e it ap|proached mo&s;t nearly. Then as its vari|ation was continually found changing, as has been ob&s;erved; being one time greater and another time le&s;s; &s;o two of the earth's magnetic poles were always moving, while the other two were fixed. For this purpo&s;e, he has &s;uppo&s;ed the globe of the earth to re&s;emble a nut, with its kernel; the kernel having two poles, and the &s;hell two more; the ker|nel and its poles going round with a &s;low motion within the &s;hell, and thus cau&s;ing the variation of the needle to be greater or le&s;s, at different times; the internal poles drawing it away from its direction to the external. The reader will, no doubt, &s;mile at &s;o complex a

&s;y&s;tem; but &s;y&s;tem making was the fault of the la&s;t age.</P>
<P>IT has been tried al&s;o, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s, to determine, to what ex|tent the &s;ame magnet diffu&s;es its attract|ing powers; and it has been found, that one day, the &s;phere of its power is much more exten&s;ive than another; that upon one trial, it would attract &s;teel filings, at fourteen feet di&s;tance; and upon a &s;econd, it could &s;carcely reach them at &s;even feet, without any apparent alteration in the weather. Some magnets al&s;o are found to act with much force upon bodies near them; but with very little, if they are removed to the lea&s;t con|&s;iderable di&s;tance; while others are re|markable for contrary properties, having an exten&s;ive reach, though no great force in approximation or contact. Doctor <HI>Hel&s;ham</HI>'s load-&s;tone attracted iron four times more &s;trongly, at one inch di&s;tance, than at two; or in a &s;imilar proportion. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s, attracted &s;ix times more &s;trongly, at one inch, than at two;
<PB N="35" REF="47">
while that of M. <HI>Du Tour,</HI> attracted but twice as &s;trong, at &s;imilar di&s;tances. For this rea&s;on, no general law can be formed concerning the increa&s;e of mag|netic power; the properties in each magnet being &s;o very various, and often the &s;ame magnet, at times, differing &s;en&s;i|bly from it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides the virtue given to iron by rubbing upon a magnet, it may acquire the &s;ame powers, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any load-&s;tone what&s;oever; and the be&s;t needles may be made artificially, merely by rubbing again&s;t other iron. A piece of &s;teel, for in&s;tance, rubbed hard, for &s;ome time, all one way, by a poli&s;hed &s;teel in&s;trument, will, by this kind of friction, conceive &s;o great a degree of virtue, as to become an artificial magnet; of greater force than the natural one. Or, if a bar of iron be left to &s;tand for a long time, in the &s;ame unaltered per|pendicular po&s;ition (as we &s;ee the bars of windows) it will acquire a magnetic power, and attract iron. But there is
<PB N="36" REF="48">
a method, which gives a power to &s;teel, far beyond what the natural magnet is able to produce; and which may be per|formed as follows.</P>
<P>PROCURE a dozen bars, &s;ix of &s;oft &s;teel, each three inches long, one quarter of an inch broad, and one twentieth of an inch thick; with two pieces of iron, each half the length of one of the bars, but of the &s;ame breadth and thickne&s;s; and &s;ix bars of hard &s;teel, each five inches and an half long, half an inch broad, and three twentieths of an inch thick; with two pieces of iron, of half the length of one of the bars, but its whole breadth and thickne&s;s. And let all the bars be marked with a line round them at one end.</P>
<P>THEN take an iron poker and tongs, the larger they are, and the longer they have been u&s;ed, the better; and fixing the poker upright, between your knees, bind one of the &s;oft bars towards the top of it, with a &s;ilk &s;tring, which mu&s;t be

held tight with the left hand, the marked end of the bar being downwards. (See Plate II. fig. 1.) Then gra&s;ping the tongs with the right hand, a little below the mid|dle, and holding them upright al&s;o; let the bar be &s;troked by the lower end, from the bottom to the top, about ten times, on each &s;ide, which will give it a magnetic power, &s;ufficient to lift a &s;mall key at the marked end; which end, if the bar was &s;u&s;pended on a point, would turn towards the north, and is therefore called the north pole.</P>
<P>FOUR of the &s;oft bars, being impreg|nated after this manner, lay the other two parallel about one fourth of an inch from each other, on the table, between the two pieces of iron belonging to them; a north, and a &s;outh pole, again&s;t each piece of iron. (See Plate II. fig. 2.) Then take two of the four bars, already made magnetical, and place them, with their flat &s;ides together, &s;o as to make a double bar in thickne&s;s; the north pole of the one, even with the &s;outh pole of the
<PB N="38" REF="51">
other. Then lay the two remaining ones, on each &s;ide of the&s;e, &s;o as to have two north, and two &s;outh poles together. You mu&s;t then &s;eparate the two north, from the two &s;outh poles, at one end, by thru&s;ting a large pin between them; and place them perpendicularly, with the &s;eparated end downward, on the middle of one of the parallel bars; the two north poles towards its &s;outh, and the two &s;outh poles, towards its north poles. In this po&s;ition, &s;lide them backward and forward, three or four times, the whole length of the bar, and fini&s;hing in the middle; remove them from the middle of this, to the middle of the other parallel bar, and go over that in the &s;ame man|ner; and turning both bars the other &s;ide upwards, repeat the operation. This being done, take the two parallel bars from between the pieces of iron, and placing the two outermo&s;t of the perpen|dicular touching bars, in their room; let the remaining two now be made the outer|mo&s;t, and tho&s;e that were parallel become the innermo&s;t of the four to touch with.
<PB N="39" REF="52">
The proce&s;s with the&s;e, being repeated as before, till each pair of bars have been touched three or four times over, which will give them a con&s;iderable magnetic power; put the half dozen together, three poles on one &s;ide, and three poles on the other; and in the former manner, touch with them, the two pair of hard bars placed between their irons, at the di&s;tance of about half an inch from each other. Then lay the &s;oft bars a&s;ide, and with the four hard ones, let the other two be impregnated, holding the touching bars apart at the lower end, near two tenths of an inch; to which di&s;tance, let them be &s;eparated after they are &s;et on the parallel bar, and brought together again, before they are taken off. With this precaution, proceed in the method de|&s;cribed above, till each pair has been touched, two or three times over.</P>
<P>THE bars, though now impregnated with &s;trong power, yet may receive &s;till greater, by touching each pair, in their parallel po&s;ition between the irons, with

This is repeated three or four times, and it will make the bars as &s;trong as they can po&s;|&s;ibly be made. The whole of this may be gone through in half an hour, and each of the bars, if well hardened, may be made to lift above two pound; a power, much greater than any load-&s;tone can confer.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Electricity.</HEAD>
<P>A Magnet attracts iron, without any previous rubbing, and its effluvia pervades the pores of all other &s;ub|&s;tances, how den&s;e &s;oever. But, be&s;ide this, there are other bodies which attract different &s;ub&s;tances, tho' they require &s;ome preparation to make their power &s;en&s;ible; and the effluvia which they emit, can pervade only &s;ome particular &s;ub&s;tances. This &s;pecies of attraction is called <HI>Electricity.</HI> For upon rubbing amber, called in Latin <HI>Electrum,</HI> it is found to attract any very light &s;ub&s;tances that are near it; and this property was known to the naturali&s;ts of antiquity, as well as the moderns. Upon further enquiry it was found, that not amber only, but &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances, had the &s;ame properties, in a high degree; that gla&s;s, re&s;inous &s;ub&s;tances, wool, &s;ilk, and hair produced the &s;ame effects. That any of the&s;e, when dry, and rub|bed
<PB N="43" REF="56">
for a &s;hort time, were always &s;een to attract motes and &s;traws to their &s;ur|face, from a pretty con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and &s;ometimes repel them again with equal force. The &s;ame trials were made upon other bodies, mo&s;t of which, after being very well dried and rubbed with long per&s;everance, &s;hewed a &s;imilar power of attraction. Two kinds of &s;ub&s;tances alone were to be found in nature, that could not become attractive; and the&s;e were fluids, which could not be &s;ubjected to the trial of rubbing; and metals, which by no arts u&s;ed could be brought to &s;hew any &s;igns of this electrical property.</P>
<P>AS &s;ome bodies were thus perceived to have the&s;e electrical properties more ea&s;ily excited in them than others, tho&s;e which quickly became attractive by rubbing, were called electric bodies. Of this kind, were all precious &s;tones, gla&s;s, porcelane, re&s;ins, bituminous &s;ub|&s;tances, wax, certain parts of animals, &s;uch as &s;ilk, feathers, hair, or wool; all the&s;e ea&s;ily becoming electrical, when
<PB N="44" REF="57">
rubbed, and exerting their power in a high degree. On the contrary, tho&s;e which took a long time to have this pro|perty excited, or which &s;hewed no &s;igns of it at all, received the name of non-electric bodies. Of this kind, were all fluid &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as water, &s;pirits or mercury; all metals, and &s;emi-metals, marble, lime-&s;tone, all living animals, all green plants and trees, and &s;ub&s;tances made from them; &s;uch as thread, paper, and linen cloth.</P>
<P>SUBSTANCES being thus cla&s;&s;ed, ac|cording to their electrical powers, it was then tried to how great a degree, bodies of the electric kind, &s;uch as gla&s;s, for in&s;tance, could be impregnated with an attracting power. A gla&s;s tube, about an inch and an half in diameter, and three feet long, being heated by rubbing, was found alternately to attract and repell all light bodies, at &s;everal inches di&s;tance. As this, however, was but a trifling power, in|&s;tead of u&s;ing a tube, experimental philo|&s;ophers procured an hollow globe of gla&s;s,
<PB N="45" REF="58">
moderately thick, and about a foot dia|meter; which being made to turn upon an axle, in the manner of a cutler's grind-&s;tone, and like that, being whirled round by means of a large wheel and &s;trap, the palm of the operator's hand kept dry by a glove, or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> white be|ing kept upon it, a great degree of fric|tion was thus excited. The globe being rubbed in this manner, was &s;een to acquire a very great electrical force, and Doctor <HI>Hel&s;ham</HI> long &s;ince found, that woollen, or &s;ilken threads, being held on one &s;ide near it, while thus turning, they would dart them&s;elves into &s;o many &s;traight lines, all pointing towards the center of the globe. The effluvia were even perceiv|able to the &s;mell and the touch; and the&s;e were the fir&s;t &s;teps, which were made in pur&s;uit of the wonders that were after|wards di&s;covered, in this part of phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>IF, while the globe was thus turning, or &s;oon after, it was touched with a piece of &s;ealing-wax, re&s;in, amber, or any other electrical &s;ub&s;tance, this made no
<PB N="46" REF="59">
alteration in its effects; the globe con|tinued to attract leaf gold, motes, or &s;traws, as before: on the contrary, when it was touched with a man's hand, a piece of metal, a &s;tick, or any other non-electric body, all its attracting power cea&s;ed in an in&s;tant, and it required to be rubbed anew. It was, however, &s;oon after perceived, that if the touching non-electric body, was placed in &s;uch a manner as to touch nothing but the electrified globe or tube, and to have no communication with any other body, it then became electric it&s;elf, attracted motes and &s;traws, and its touching did not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h the efficacy of the gla&s;&s;es attracting power. If, for in&s;tance, a piece of metal, or any other non-electric body, was fixed on the top of a gla&s;s tube, taking care that it touched nothing but the gla&s;s only; and then the tube, being electrified, by rubbing with the hand, the metal above was &s;een it&s;elf to become electric; and like the gla&s;s to attract and repel light &s;ub&s;tances; and like it, when the finger was brought near
<PB N="47" REF="60">
it, about the di&s;tance of half an inch, to &s;nap and crackle. But if the metal, while it touched the globe, touched al&s;o the earth, or any other non-electric body that communicated with the earth, as a man &s;tanding on the ground, a chair, a table, or &s;uch like, all its new acquired virtue, in&s;tantly ran into the man, or the table, and from thence down to the earth; where, like &s;pilled water, it vani&s;hed, and was lo&s;t in an in&s;tant, and was no longer capable of its former exertions.</P>
<P>IN order, therefore, to &s;top this cur|rent of electrical effluvia from running into the ground, &s;omething was to be placed between the man's feet and the earth, that would prevent the electrical ef|fluvia from going any farther. Now it was found, that all electrical &s;ub&s;tances could do this; for though they become electri|cal by rubbing them&s;elves, yet they never admitted the effluvia from another electri|cal body, but re&s;i&s;ted its further progre&s;s. If, therefore, a cake of re&s;in, wax, or
<PB N="48" REF="61">
any other &s;trongly electrical &s;ub&s;tance, be placed under the man's feet, while he touches the electrified globe, he becomes filled with the electrical effluvia, which has no power to e&s;cape downward, as the cake re&s;i&s;ts it, and he is as capable of attracting light &s;ub&s;tances, to the &s;urface of his body, as the globe it&s;elf. A piece of metal, in&s;tead of the man, will do the &s;ame, &s;o will all non-electric &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>IN general therefore we may ob&s;erve, that the electrical effluvia can be poured into all non-electric &s;ub&s;tances at plea&s;ure by communication; that they receive it &s;imply, at the approach of the electric globe or tube, which is heated by fric|tion, and communicate it to all other non-electric bodies, with which they are united, though this union &s;hould be never &s;o exten&s;ive. On the contrary, electric bodies, who&s;e power can be excited by rubbing, will receive no effluvia by communication from other electrified &s;ub&s;tances, but repel all their emanations.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="62">LET us now then &s;uppo&s;e the whole electrical apparatus prepared, the gla&s;s globe turning &s;wiftly upon its axle, by means of a wheel, and rubbed by the hand of the operator, while the per&s;on to be electrified &s;tands upon a cake of re&s;in, wax and &s;ulphur, mixed together, of about fifteen inches diameter, while he touches the upper part of the globe, or &s;ome non-electric &s;ub&s;tance, that com|municates with it. The weather being dry, and the room &s;pacious, we &s;hall &s;ee the following wonders en&s;ue. In a few &s;econds, the man will be filled with ef|fluvia; he will become perfectly electrical; his hands, and every part of his body will attract and repell light &s;ub&s;tances at four feet di&s;tance, and even farther, if the weather be extremely dry. Each of the&s;e little &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as &s;traws, motes, and leaf gold, are at fir&s;t drawn towards the electrified body with great &s;wiftne&s;s, and then when they have been &s;aturated with the electric vapour, and have become equally electric them&s;elves, they are repelled with equal force.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="63">WHATEVER non-electric body, the man electrified holds in his hand, be|comes electrified like him&s;elf, provided it has no other communication but with him&s;elf, or &s;ome electric body, into which its effluvia cannot enter. And this exten&s;ion of the electrical effluvia, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing its quantity, &s;eems rather to increa&s;e its force, as well in the man, as whatever he holds in his hand. So that if a thou&s;and men &s;hould take hold of each other's hands, provided they be all placed upon cakes of re&s;in, or &s;ome other electric body, the la&s;t man will be as &s;oon electrified as the fir&s;t, and the greate&s;t number rather more &s;trongly than one at a time. However, if any one of them have the &s;malle&s;t communi|cation with a non-electric body, which leads to the ground, if, for in&s;tance, one of the&s;e thou&s;and men &s;hould have a linen thread, reaching from the &s;kirt of his coat to the earth, the whole effluvia would e&s;cape through that narrow con|ducter, to be lo&s;t entirely. If the&s;e men, in&s;tead of holding hands, &s;hould each
<PB N="51" REF="64">
hold an iron chain between them, they will be electrified with equal velocity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IF now, the electrified man, who &s;tands foremo&s;t, cea&s;es to touch the turn|ing globe, he will, neverthele&s;s, continue for a good while impregnated with the electricity he has received, as well as all the re&s;t to whom it has been communi|cated; however, their power of attracting and repelling light &s;ub&s;tances, will in|&s;en&s;ibly begin to dimini&s;h, till, after &s;ome time, it totally cea&s;es. Metallic &s;ub&s;tances are found to hold this electri|city, infu&s;ed into them, much longer than animals; probably, becau&s;e their electric matter does not tran&s;pire, as in animals, by per&s;piration. But to make all electricity cea&s;e in a moment, in either, it is &s;ufficient ju&s;t to touch them with any non-electric &s;ub&s;tance that communicates to the ground.</P>
<P>IF one, who is not electrified, brings his hand near the face of the per&s;on under the operation, he will perceive
<PB N="52" REF="65">
the impre&s;&s;ion of a fluid atmo&s;phere about it; and continuing to approach his finger to &s;ome protuberant part, the no&s;e for example, if the room be darkened, the finger and the no&s;e will appear en|lightened; and when they approach &s;till nearer, there will proceed, from the per&s;on electrified, with &s;ome noi&s;e, a bright &s;tream like fire, which will affect both parties at once, with a &s;mall &s;en|&s;ation of pain, and which will be painful in proportion to the &s;trength of the elec|tricity. This &s;tream will be equally pro|duced by the touch, from any part of the body, and even through the clothes; all that is required, being only that the touching per&s;on be not electrified him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is by this &s;mall &s;tream, that the effluvia migrate from one body to another; &s;o that if the barrel of a gun, or any other metallic body which is non-electric, be &s;u&s;pended by &s;ilk cords which are electric, and &s;top the progre&s;|&s;ion of the effluvia, it becomes electrified, by a &s;ingle touch from the man, under the operation; and what is more extra|ordinary,
<PB N="53" REF="66">
the greater this non-electric body is, the more powerful is its electricity.</P>
<P>IF a &s;teel wire of five or &s;ix hundred yards, be &s;u&s;pended in like manner, by &s;ilken cords, the in&s;tant it receives elec|tricity at one end, it is felt at the other; for the remote end will be found to attract leaf gold, the moment the nearer end touches either the man or the globe; and the effects, thus in&s;tantly excited, may be as in&s;tantly repre&s;&s;ed, by the touch of a per&s;on who &s;tands on the ground. If a man, &s;tanding on a cake of re&s;in, &s;hould, with the point of a &s;word, approach the wire thus electrified, yet without touching, he becomes him|&s;elf equally &s;o; from whence it appears, that the effluvia can pa&s;s from one &s;ub|&s;tance to another, without either coming into contact.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have &s;een how elec|tricity flows, either back or forward, with amazing velocity, and that it can be accumulated in any body at plea&s;ure, by &s;imple infu&s;ion. It will be found al&s;o, to
<PB N="54" REF="67">
exert all the&s;e powers in a <HI>vacuum,</HI> or place free from air, with a greater force; for if a globe be placed in &s;uch a manner in a receiver, exhau&s;ted of its air, that it may &s;till continue to be rubbed with the hand, while the rubbing continues, and while the air is kept away, the globe will &s;end forth a very bright light, in great quantities; but its brilliancy will become more feeble in proportion as the air is admitted, though the rubbing &s;hould be continued all the while.</P>
<P>IF it be de&s;ired to give the electrical explo&s;ion &s;till greater force, and to in|crea&s;e the quantity and brightne&s;s of the flame, more globes than one mu&s;t be procured, all communicating with, and pouring their effluvia into one non-electric body. A long tube of white iron is generally made u&s;e of, for this purpo&s;e; as receiving the greate&s;t quantity of effluvia, and retaining it longe&s;t, and ea&s;ily conducting it wherever the opera|tor's hand thinks proper. The flame that this iron tube, (or conductor let us call it) when electrified, &s;ends forth at

the approach of the finger, re&s;embles even lightning it&s;elf; it darts from the conductor to a great di&s;tance, to meet the finger, and occa&s;ions a &s;marting pain.</P>
<P>WHEN the conductor, or any other non-electric body, has been thus electri|fied, and has received as great a quantity of effluvia as it can bear, the overcharged effluvia, which is continued to be poured in from the turning globe, flows out, either from the whole &s;urface, like a bright light, or from &s;ome point or angle of its &s;urface, in a &s;tream, like that which is excited by the approach of the finger. The flame re&s;embles in form that of a hi&s;&s;ing &s;quib, (&s;ee fig. 4.) narrow upon i&s;&s;uing out, but diffu&s;ing its rays as it goes farther. If the finger be now ap|proached to this &s;tream, another wonder will appear. A &s;tream of fire will proceed from the finger, in an oppo&s;ite direction to the other; narrow upon leaving the finger, but diffu&s;ing its rays as it goes forward. When both flames have ap|proached &s;o near as that they join, they then quickly conden&s;e, and an appear|ance
<PB N="56" REF="70">
is excited, that every way re&s;embles lightning; the fla&s;h is &s;udden, the noi&s;e is loud, a &s;ulphureous &s;mell en&s;ues, a great pain and &s;hock is felt, and a &s;light burn remains upon the finger that &s;u&s;|tains the experiment. We may kindle &s;pirits of wine a little warm, gunpowder, or any other inflammable &s;ub&s;tance in the &s;ame manner, by holding them near a &s;tream of fire, i&s;&s;uing from &s;ome point or angle of the conductor.</P>
<P>BUT the flame excited in this way, is but a &s;park, compared to that excited by the famous <HI>Leyden</HI> experiment; the cau&s;e of which, no philo&s;opher has yet been able exactly to account for. A per&s;on holds by the bottom, in the broad of his hand, a decanter or bottle almo&s;t filled with water, in &s;uch a manner, as not to touch any of the empty part of the bottle with his fingers. Then an iron wire, that touches the globe or the con|ductor with one of its ends, is made to dip the other end into the water contained in the bottle, but &s;o as not to touch the gla&s;s in any part. While the per&s;on holds
<PB N="57" REF="71">
the bottle thus, in the left hand, and the globe being &s;trongly electrified, if he touches the conductor or the wire with the knuckle of his right, he will imme|diately feel a mo&s;t violent &s;hock en&s;ue, the force of which &s;eems diffu&s;ed over his whole body; &s;o great is its force, that Mr. <HI>Mu&s;chenbroke,</HI> who was the fir&s;t who publi&s;hed this experiment, thought, when he fir&s;t felt it, that it had killed him. This experiment was, &s;ome-time after, improved by Doctor <HI>Bevis</HI>; who, in&s;tead of a bottle with water, made u&s;e of a large &s;quare pane of gla&s;s, and a different non-electric, namely, a me|tallic &s;ub&s;tance, in this manner. A large &s;quare pane of gla&s;s, of about twenty inches diameter, though the larger the better, is tinned on both &s;ides, as we &s;ee the back &s;ide of a looking gla&s;s; on both &s;ides however, there is a margin left all round untinned of about two inches broad. The gla&s;s being thus prepared, is placed flat upon a metal &s;tand, &s;o that the under &s;ide of the pane lies upon a non-electric body, which it&s;elf commu|nicates
<PB N="58" REF="72">
with the ground. The upper &s;ide of the gla&s;s parte, is made to communi|cate with either the electrifying globe it&s;elf, or its conductor, by means of an iron chain. Things being thus di&s;po&s;ed, the chain is &s;trongly electrified by turn|ing the globe, and thus communicating with the upper &s;ide of the pane, is elec|trified al&s;o. Now &s;hould a man be &s;o ra&s;h, things being in this &s;ituation, as to touch the under &s;urface of the pane with one hand, while with the other he touches the chain that communicates be|tween the upper &s;urface and the globe, the &s;hock would be &s;o terrible, that it would &s;trike him dead in an in&s;tant. But to avoid this, the operator takes a bent iron wire, curved &s;omewhat in the form of a C, which is fixed in a gla&s;s handle that prevents the effluvia from coming to his hand; he takes, I &s;ay, this wire thus bent, and blunted at both ends, and with this touches at the &s;ame time, the under &s;urface and the upper chain that leads to the globe. The moment of the touch a fla&s;h of lightning en&s;ues, which
<PB N="59" REF="73">
dazzles the eyes with its &s;plendour; the noi&s;e may be heard at a great di&s;tance, and its force is &s;uch, that it can penetrate &s;everal &s;heets of paper laid upon the upper &s;urface of the gla&s;s, or melt leaf gold, when properly placed to receive the flame.</P>
<P>AS nothing we have hitherto men|tioned &s;erves to explain the phaenomena of this and the former amazing experi|ments, and as it in &s;ome mea&s;ure departs from the u&s;ual laws of electricity; &s;everal very learned men have been much per|plexed to account for it. Here we &s;ee gla&s;s, which in the u&s;ual in&s;tances is un|touched by the electrical effluvia, in this experiment tran&s;mitting it, or at lea&s;t, &s;trongly affected by it. The <HI>Abb&eacute; Nollet,</HI> Doctor <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jallabert,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> have all attempted to account for it, and each in a different way from the re&s;t: it would be impertinent here to recite or confute any of their opinions, we &s;hall only give an explanation later than theirs, namely, that of Mr. <HI>Monier,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="74">
who delivers it him&s;elf as a mere con|jecture, and as &s;uch we repeat it. It is true, he &s;ays, that gla&s;s re&s;i&s;ts the admi&s;|&s;ion of electric effluvia, when tho&s;e effluvia touch its &s;urface but in one or two points; but when it is united with a non-electric body, &s;ending forth its effluvia more clo&s;ely, &s;o as to touch &s;urface again&s;t &s;urface; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the gla&s;s imbibes the effluvia like a non-electric body. For in&s;tance, as the &s;urface of the water in a bottle, touches the internal &s;urface of the gla&s;s in every part, when this water is &s;trongly electrified for &s;ome time, the gla&s;s will al&s;o imbibe a part of the effluvia from the water. Now this being admitted, and experiments &s;hew it to be true; after it has thus for &s;ome time imbibed the effluvia on its inner &s;urface, this will make it begin to imbibe them on its outer &s;urface al&s;o; &s;o that if the bottle be held in the hand, it will al&s;o imbibe the effluvia of the hand. Now it ap|pears, that this current of effluvia coming from the hand is greater than that coming from the water within; &s;o that
<PB N="61" REF="75">
the two currents meeting in oppo&s;ite directions, the &s;tronger &s;tream will over|power the weaker, and the whole current will run from the hand to the outer &s;urface of the bottle, from thence to its inner &s;urface, and &s;o inward to the water. If now, while the whole bottle is thus imbibing the effluvia from the hand that holds it, the man, with the other hand, touches the conductor, and charges him|&s;elf in this manner with a fre&s;h quantity of effluvia, the whole torrent running towards the hand with the bottle; the hand that holds it will receive a mo&s;t vio|lent &s;hock as the increa&s;ed effluvia enters the &s;urface of the gla&s;s, and at the &s;ame time that the other hand which touches the conductor, receives al&s;o a &s;light &s;hock from this quarter, &s;o that the whole body feels at once two concu&s;&s;ions; and this produces the violence that is felt in the experiment of <HI>Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, the great re&s;em|blance which the flame thus excited, in every re&s;pect, bore to that which fla&s;hes
<PB N="62" REF="76">
from thunder, gave philo&s;ophers the fir&s;t hint of trying whether lightning was not actually the re&s;ult of electricity. Upon examination, it was found that the air is often charged with va&s;t quantities of electrical effluvia; that an iron wire &s;u&s;pended by electrical &s;trings, often im|bibed this fluid from the clouds in great plenty; that in times of thunder it was particularly charged with it, and often with &s;o much more than it could contain, that the fluid &s;treamed over from its points in great abundance. All this proved in|conte&s;tably that lightning is no other than the electrical fla&s;h of &s;ome non-electrical uncharged body in the air touching another made electric by friction, or charged by communication. And this may be ea&s;ily enough conceived, if we &s;uppo&s;e a large quantity of dry air be|come perfectly electrical, and touched by a non-electric cloud, as in an iron conductor applied to a gla&s;s globe, the fla&s;h en&s;ues, and the in&s;tantaneous loud noi&s;e is heard, which being echoed &s;everal times among the clouds, before it
<PB N="63" REF="77">
comes to us, gives the continuing &s;ound of thunder. If the fla&s;h &s;hould reach &s;o low as the earth, and a per&s;on &s;hould un|fortunately be in the place of its explo&s;ion, he is generally &s;truck dead in a moment, and feels the mo&s;t in&s;tantaneous of all kinds of death.</P>
<P>BUT this theory is not only amu&s;ing, but u&s;eful; for as in &s;ome countries the damages &s;u&s;tained by thunder are frequent and terrible, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> has invented a method of &s;ecuring the hou&s;es, and con&s;equently the inhabitants, from its violence. It is no more than procuring a long iron rod, which reaches from the cloud to the earth, and is &s;o erected in or near a hou&s;e, as to touch no non-electric &s;ub&s;tance whatever, except the ground below, and the cloud above. The end of this rod, touching the electrified cloud, imbibes the electric fluid with which the cloud is charged, and carries it down to the earth; where it is di&s;&s;ipated without farther mi&s;chief.</P>

than the Ether of the ancients, or of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> which is diffu&s;ed through the whole &s;y&s;tem of the world; and the motions of which, give movement to all the re&s;t of matter. To explain the re&s;em|blance between Ether and electricity, it has been in a former chapter ob&s;erved, that this Ether is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in greate&s;t quantity, or den&s;e&s;t, in the mo&s;t porous bodies; and on the other hand, more fine and &s;ubtil in den&s;e bodies, &s;uch as gold. It is al&s;o known by experience, that upon heating or rubbing any &s;ub|&s;tance whatever, it &s;wells under the operation, grows bigger, and con&s;e|quently becomes more porous. Now, &s;ay &s;ome, in proportion as the body becomes porous, the &s;urrounding Ether ru&s;hes into it, and accumulates within, till the heat or the rubbing cea&s;ing, the body gradually &s;hrinks to its former dimen|&s;ions, and the Ether is again ejected. Now this, they continue, is exactly what happens in electricity; the &s;urface of the body is encrea&s;ed by rubbing, the elec|trical fluid ru&s;hes into its pores, and there
<PB N="67" REF="81">
remains for &s;ome time, till the effects of the rubbing cea&s;es. And as the body, which by its dilatation receives this fluid, is, during the time of rubbing, continually taking in an overplus; and con&s;tantly, after the rubbing has cea&s;ed, by contracting it&s;elf, is &s;queezing out what remains, a part will be thus forced into whatever body comes in contact with it: it will, they &s;ay, be forced into all bodies that communicate, except &s;uch as have an extremely den&s;e atmo&s;phere &s;urrounding them, which like a &s;hell defends them from the incur&s;ions of this fluid that would thus force an entrance. But it is, they add, known by experience, that of all &s;ub|&s;tances, tho&s;e which contain light within them have the den&s;e&s;t atmo&s;phere; of this &s;ort are gla&s;s, re&s;in, diamonds, and in &s;hort, all highly electrical bodies. Bodies like the&s;e are ever found to re&s;i&s;t the incur&s;ions of this fluid, except their pores are opened and their atmo&s;phere rarified by rubbing. This den&s;e atmo&s;|phere which &s;urrounds them effectually, prevents the entrance of the fluid by
<PB N="68" REF="82">
communication; and in like manner, when the fluid is introduced by rubbing, keeps it a long time &s;hut up in the body, and prevents it from e&s;caping. For this rea&s;on we find electrical &s;ub&s;tances never receive the fluid by the touch alone, but when they have been other|wi&s;e excited, they hold the fluid a longer time than non-electric bodies are found to do.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Attraction of Cohe&s;ion and Ca|pillary tubes.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto &s;een attraction to prevail in every part of nature, that has fallen under our notice; magnets to attract bodies at a di&s;tance without rubbing, electric &s;ub&s;tances performing the &s;ame effects upon being rubbed: but be&s;ides the&s;e powers in nature of form|ing large ma&s;&s;es by uniting bodies to|gether, there is one of another kind, in which bodies that at the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible di&s;tance have no power of attracting each other, yet being touched together clo&s;ely join and unite with a kind of &s;ympathetic fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>WE perceive &s;everal bodies when ap|plied to each other &s;tick clo&s;ely, while others, though united never &s;o clo&s;ely, or never &s;o long, cannot be made to adhere after the force that kept them together is taken away. This power of cohe&s;ion,
<PB N="72" REF="86">
by which bodies are held together, has perplexed the philo&s;ophers of every age, and every age has attempted the &s;olution. Some have a&s;cribed this tena|city of bodies, to a kind of hook'd for|mation in the atoms that compo&s;ed them; &s;o that two atoms like burs &s;tick to each other, the hooks in one catching tho&s;e of the other. As this however was explaining one difficulty by a &s;till greater; <HI>Bernouilli</HI> a&s;cribed all cohe&s;ion to the uniform pre&s;&s;ure of our atmo&s;|phere. This theory he endeavoured to &s;upport by an experiment of two poli&s;hed marbles, which would co|here in the open air, but would drop a&s;under in <HI>vacuo,</HI> or a place where the air was exhau&s;ted. But unfortunately for him, this fact happens to be fal&s;e. Others were for a&s;cribing cohe&s;ion to an occult quality in bodies, by which they aimed at a &s;tate of re&s;t; and others again a&s;&s;erted, that the attempt at motion in all the parts of a body pro|duced the re&s;t of all, and thus they hap|pened to unite into ma&s;&s;es of peculiar
<PB N="73" REF="87">
&s;izes and hardne&s;s. Such were the former weak attempts to &s;olve this difficulty. <HI>Newton</HI> however &s;aw, with the greate&s;t degree of probability, that this tenacity of bodies might be produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e by which we &s;ee iron fly to the load-&s;tone, or &s;traws move to amber; in &s;hort, that it was produced by attraction, a cau&s;e unknown to us indeed, but of which, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, we &s;ee the effects. The &s;urfaces of all bo|dies, &s;aith he, are unequal, which cau&s;es that they touch only in a &s;mall number of points, when placed one upon the other. The le&s;s une|qual the &s;urfaces of the bodies the more they touch, and con&s;equently the more they attract each other. Thus we &s;ee, that tho&s;e which have the evene&s;t &s;urfaces, have the greate&s;t power of cohe&s;ion; and if, to render the&s;e &s;ur|faces &s;till more uniform, the pores be filled up with &s;ome liquid, the power of cohe&s;ion will be &s;till greater.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="88">IN the &s;ame manner all &s;olid bodies when brought into contact, as well as all liquids what&s;oever, adhere to each other. The&s;e attract &s;olid bodies, and are mutually attracted by them; from whence it appears, that this attracting power is diffu&s;ed over all parts of nature, at lea&s;t &s;uch as we have hitherto exa|mined. If we apply the &s;urfaces of two looking gla&s;&s;es to each other, being pre|viou&s;ly well poli&s;hed, cleaned and dryed, it will be found that they adhere to each other with a very &s;en&s;ible tenacity. The &s;ame effects will happen in <HI>vacuo</HI> (or a &s;pace emptied of its air) as well as in the u&s;ual manner. If two leaden balls be cut &s;o as to have even &s;urfaces, and they be pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t each other with a twi&s;t, it will be &s;een that they adhere with a force equal to forty or fifty pounds weight. In general, all bodies who&s;e &s;urfaces are even will thus &s;tick to each other, and if a liquid be &s;meared over either &s;urface, their cohe&s;ion will be &s;till the &s;tronger.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="89">IT is this liquid or thick oil which is contained in the bodies of all plants and vegetables that holds their parts together; and we are taught by chymi&s;try, that if this be burned away the re&s;t will fall into a&s;hes, and without the re&s;toration of &s;ome other fluid, the parts cannot again be united. The bones of animals al&s;o, if calcined in &s;uch a manner as that all their oil &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, while their form is pre&s;erved, will be found to become extremely brittle, but they will in &s;ome mea&s;ure recover their former &s;trength if they be dipt in oil. Thus we find that &s;ome bodies are thus perceived to cohere, and to be more tenacious than others, by means of this fluid, or el&s;e from their internal conformation, by which the &s;urfaces of every particle of matter contained in them, touch the &s;ur|faces of the neighbouring particles in the greate&s;t number of points.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;chenbroek</HI> has made many experi|ments to find the force with which the parts of many bodies are found to cohere
<PB N="76" REF="90">
to each other; or in other words, how much force is required to pull the parts of any body a&s;under, drawing them accord|ing to the length of their fibres. In the&s;e trials he found that the beech and a&s;h were the toughe&s;t of all woods; next to them the oak, then the linden and alder, then the elm, and la&s;tly the fir; the weight required to pull a piece of a&s;h a&s;under, being more than double what was &s;ufficient to break the fir. He al&s;o made &s;imilar trials on metals; of the&s;e, gold was the mo&s;t tenacious, then iron, &s;ilver, yellow bra&s;s, copper, tin, lead.</P>
<P>But bodies are found to attract each other at minute &s;en&s;ible di&s;tances, as well as in contact. If we place between two gla&s;s plates, &s;uch as tho&s;e which have already been mentioned, a fine &s;ilk thread, then we may ea&s;ily conceive tho&s;e two plates will not touch, &s;ince they will be &s;eparated from each other by the whole thickne&s;s of the thread; but however, notwith&s;tanding this &s;e|paration, the two plates will mutually
<PB N="77" REF="91">
attract each other, though with le&s;s force than if there were nothing between them. Place between the plates two threads of the &s;ame twi&s;ted together, and afterwards three; the gla&s;&s;es will &s;till attract, but with le&s;s force than before.</P>
<P>IT is by this power, &s;aith <HI>Newton,</HI> that the &s;mall particles of bodies act one upon another, at &s;mall &s;en&s;ible di&s;|tances, and cau&s;e &s;everal phaenomena in nature. This opinion has been driven as far as it could well bear, by <HI>Freind</HI> and <HI>Keil,</HI> and been brought to explain all the theory of chymi&s;try, as well as &s;ome other obvious appearances. Some bodies, &s;ay they, have a greater power of attracting certain kindred bodies than others. Thus water, in which the gall-nut has been di&s;&s;olved, attracts the parts of iron, and forms the black liquor called ink; but if we pour into this ink &s;pirits of nitre, with which the iron has a greater affinity, or by which it is more &s;trongly attracted, then the iron, before di&s;&s;olved in the gall water, flies to its
<PB N="78" REF="92">
more kindred fluid the &s;pirit of nitre, and &s;inks with it to the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, leaving the water at top quite clear of any colour, except that given it by the gall-nut originally. If again we pour into this compo&s;ition &s;pirits of vitriol, between which and &s;pirits of nitre there is the utmo&s;t affinity, the nitre &s;pirit immediately quits the iron which it before united it&s;elf to, in order to join with the more kindred &s;pirit of vitriol; and the iron, thus let free, is once more &s;u&s;pended like a black fluid in the gall-water, as before. By this me|thod al&s;o of rea&s;oning, we may account for all tho&s;e changes wrought in the co|lour and ta&s;tes of liquors, upon their be|ing mixed with each other. For whether they be naturally fluids, or only bodies di&s;&s;olved or &s;u&s;pended in fluids, the kindred bodies fly to their peculiar kindred bodies. But if the affinity between the fluids and the body &s;u&s;pended, be greater than be|tween the particles of the body it&s;elf, the body &s;till remains &s;u&s;pended or di&s;&s;olved; but if the parts of the body attract each
<PB N="79" REF="93">
other with greater force than the liquid attracts them, then they begin to cry&s;talize, or to unite into ma&s;&s;es of &s;uch figures as the peculiar kinds of &s;alt are u&s;ually found to be. La&s;tly, when, continue our authors, upon the mixture of two bodies in the &s;ame liquor, which are both more &s;trongly attracted by each other than by the fluid that &s;urrounds them, they happen to &s;trike again&s;t each other, if they happen to be ela&s;tic they will con&s;equently be driven back with a degree of force almo&s;t equal to that with which they have been attracted; and this alter|nate attraction and repul&s;ion will produce a fermentation in the whole. In this man|ner &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> philo&s;ophers have at|tempted to account for many chymical phaenomena; much has been objected again&s;t their theories, and the truth is, when examined clo&s;ely, they have neither that preci&s;ion nor per&s;picuity which &s;ubjects of this nature require; however, this di&s;qui&s;ition belongs more properly to chymi&s;ts than natural philo&s;ophers, and with them we leave it.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="94">BUT to prove the attracting power of one body upon another beyond all po&s;&s;i|bility of doubt; if a gla&s;s bubble be &s;et to float on water contained in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from one &s;ide of it, though at fir&s;t it appears motionle&s;s, yet after a very &s;hort time, from a &s;tate of re&s;t it will begin to move towards the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, and that with a velo|city encrea&s;ing as it approaches the power attracting, till at la&s;t, it &s;hall &s;trike the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el with &s;ome force. This approaching of the drop to the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el is al&s;o the more re|markable, as it in &s;ome mea&s;ure moves up hill, the water in the gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el ri&s;ing all round the edges, as is obvious to every minute's experience.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew this attracting power in an in&s;tance or two more. If two poli&s;hed plates of gla&s;s, &s;uch as we have men|tioned above, be both placed edgeways in water, their &s;urfaces very near and parallel to each other, a &s;mall part of the
<PB N="81" REF="95">
gla&s;&s;es being only thus immer&s;ed, the water will ri&s;e up between them, and the le&s;s the di&s;tance between the two &s;urfaces of the gla&s;&s;es, the higher will the water ri&s;e. If the di&s;tance between them be about the hundredth part of an inch, the water will ri&s;e to about an inch; if the di&s;tance be but half that, the water will ri&s;e but half as high.</P>
<P>AS water or any other fluid (except mercury) thus a&s;cends between poli&s;hed plates of gla&s;s, &s;o it does likewi&s;e in &s;lender pipes of gla&s;s open at both ends, (commonly called capillary tubes.) The&s;e capillary tubes of gla&s;s may be drawn to an exce&s;&s;ive finene&s;s, much &s;lenderer than the fine&s;t wire of an harp&s;ichord, by means of a blow pipe and candle. If one of the&s;e hair-like tubes be dipped at one end into water, &s;pirit of wine, or any other convenient fluid, the liquor will ri&s;e to con&s;iderable heights, the narrower the tube the higher the liquor. This &s;pontaneous elevation of the fluid,
<PB N="82" REF="96">
which is in appearance contrary to its natural weight, demands our mo&s;t parti|cular attention. The body of man may be compared to an hydraulic machine, it it may be con&s;idered as a collection of tubes with their proper fluids running through each. In the almo&s;t infinite number of pipes which thus compo&s;e the human frame, tho&s;e of the &s;mall capillary kind, are without doubt the greate&s;t in number; for this rea&s;on therefore, a thorough knowledge of the&s;e, intere&s;ts us the more.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject is difficult, and requires patience and revi&s;ion. The a&s;cent of the fluids, in capillary tubes, has been by the be&s;t philo&s;ophers a&s;cribed to the power of the &s;ides of the tubes attracting the fluid; but there are &s;ome things which embarra&s;s this opinion, and Doctor <HI>Jurin</HI> was the fir&s;t who treated the &s;ubject with much accuracy and preci&s;ion. Before the method of explaining this phaeno|menon was broached by <HI>Newton,</HI> &s;ome
<PB N="83" REF="97">
a&s;cribed the ri&s;ing of the fluid in the nar|row tube to the unequal pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere; the air, &s;aid they, is com|po&s;ed of parts which &s;tick to each other, and con&s;equently cannot enter the narrow tube where it is open at the top, there|fore not being able to pre&s;s upon the fluid within the tube, as it does upon the fluid without, the fluid is pu&s;hed up by the external pre&s;&s;ure being greater than the internal. This whole hypothe&s;is is de|&s;troyed by a &s;ingle experiment, for the fluid ri&s;es in <HI>vacuo,</HI> where there is no air, as well as in the ordinary manner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;et of naturali&s;ts have ima|gined, that upon the tube's being im|mer&s;ed in water, that part of the water in immediate contact with the internal &s;urface of the tube, lo&s;t its weight down|wards by its adherence to the &s;ides of the gla&s;s; that it was therefore pu&s;hed up|ward by that part of the water immedi|ately below it, which coming into the place of the former, lo&s;t its own weight
<PB N="84" REF="98">
in the &s;ame manner, by adhering to the inner &s;ides of the tube, and that thus &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive columns of water were forced up and &s;u&s;pended. But if this &s;y&s;tem were true, the tube, by being plunged into the water in &s;uch a manner as would cau&s;e the fluid to adhere to it in greate&s;t quan|tity, would be mo&s;t filled with the fluid. However, the tube which is but &s;lightly dipped becomes as well filled as that which is deeply immer&s;ed in the fluid. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems being found inadequate to the purpo&s;es of explaining this appear|ance, later philo&s;ophers have had recour&s;e to attraction, all agreeing that the fluid is attracted by the tube, but they differ in the part by which the tube attracts. Some have &s;aid, (&s;uch as <HI>Hawk&s;by</HI> and <HI>Morgan</HI>) that the internal &s;urface of the tube at|tracts the fluid and cau&s;es it to ri&s;e, till the weight of the fluid, &s;o rai&s;ed, be|comes equal to that power, which thus lifts it above its level, and then it &s;tops without ri&s;ing. This explication, how|ever, is by no means &s;atisfactory; for, as
<PB N="85" REF="99">
we have &s;aid before, the narrowne&s;s of the tube and the height to which the water ri&s;es are always in the &s;ame pro|portion; as for in&s;tance, if a tube the hundredth part of an inch diameter, rai&s;es the water to one inch, a tube the fiftieth part of an inch will rai&s;e ju&s;t half an inch of water. Now the internal &s;urfaces of the tubes cannot be the cau&s;e of the water's ri&s;ing in either, for in the narrow tube, the &s;urface applied to rai&s;e the water, is greater than in the wide one; whereas, in the latter, the quantity of water rai&s;ed is greater; wherefore, if the &s;urfaces were the cau&s;e of attraction, the greate&s;t &s;ur|face would rai&s;e the greate&s;t quantity.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Jurin</HI> perceiving the in&s;uffi|ciency of this explication, has given one of his own; but fir&s;t, a very remarkable experiment is nece&s;&s;ary towards explain|ing it. Dip the tube A B (fig. 5.) of two different diameters into water. Though a tube of the diameter of the part C B could elevate the water only to the point
<PB N="86" REF="100">
E, yet if it be filled with water up to D, this water will not &s;ink again, but con|tinue &s;u&s;pended in the tube as high as if it were only of the &s;mall diameter of the parts A C throughout. By this ex|periment it is obvious, that the liquor does not remain &s;u&s;pended, by the attracting power of the whole internal &s;urface, &s;ince here there is no proportion between the thing which rai&s;es, and the thing which is rai&s;ed; the quantity of &s;urface attracting, being very trifling in this ex|periment, and the quantity of water rai&s;ed very great. Our judicious philo|&s;opher, therefore, is of opinion, that as the fluid ri&s;es in proportion to the diameter of the tube in its upper part, that it is attracted by that ring of the internal &s;ur|face of the tube, which is touched by the upper &s;urface of the fluid as it a&s;cends. As this ring is narrow the water ri&s;es high, as it is wide the water &s;inks in proportion.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Clairault</HI> is &s;till for another hy|pothe&s;is, and thinks the inferior end of
<PB N="87" REF="101">
the tube is the chief elevating power; like the former, however, he allows attraction to be the cau&s;e; but &s;till it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the laws of this attrac|tion, at what di&s;tance it acts, or how the &s;ame acknowledged force is found to rai&s;e, in one in&s;tance, a large weight of water, and in another, is incapable of &s;upporting a much le&s;s, are things not yet clearly made out; we know enough of the general appearances of capil|lary tubes, to a&s;cribe their power to at|traction; &s;ome exceptions only rai&s;e doubts, and teach us to &s;u&s;pend our entire a&s;&s;ent; only &s;till let us appear &s;en&s;ible that ignorance is better than error.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the cau&s;es of the a&s;|cent of fluids in capillary tubes, the ex|periment is obvious, and in the explica|tion of many parts of nature, we &s;hall find the doctrine of fluids a&s;cending in ca|pillary tubes of great utility. The human frame, as we have already remarked, is a machine compo&s;ed of numberle&s;s tubes of

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Attraction of Gravity.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto &s;een an attrac|tion prevail at &s;en&s;ible di&s;tances between iron and the load-&s;tone; we have &s;een it prevail in a more general manner between electric and non-electric &s;ub&s;tances; it has been found exi&s;ting &s;till more generally in almo&s;t every body that can be &s;ubjected to experiment, operating mo&s;t &s;trongly in cohe&s;ion, and lo&s;ing its force in proportion as the two bodies un|der experiment were removed from each other. If now, therefore, we would de|&s;ire to enquire into the rea&s;on that all bo|dies continually fall to the &s;urface of the earth, would we a&s;k the cau&s;e that impells them rather downwards than upwards, the an&s;wer will be obvious, namely, attraction. The &s;ame &s;ecret cau&s;e that impells iron to the load-&s;tone, or motes to amber, influences all bodies on the &s;urface of the earth to fly to it. It is a rule adopted by philo&s;ophers and con|firmed
<PB N="93" REF="107">
by common &s;en&s;e, that more cau&s;es than one are not to be a&s;&s;igned for &s;imilar effects; here we &s;ee nature ope|rating in many in&s;tances entirely like her operations in others, and therefore we mu&s;t account for her operations by the &s;ame rule in both ca&s;es. Let us, there|fore, for a moment, con&s;ider the earth as one great attracting body, drawing like a magnet every thing to its &s;urface; a &s;tone when forced up into the air, by the &s;trength of the &s;linger's arm, comes down again by the earth's attracting power; a cannon ball &s;hot upwards, is brought back by the earth's influence, with almo&s;t equal velocity. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay again, that the earth acts upon the&s;e bodies in a manner, &s;imilar to that with which amber acts upon &s;traws, or a mag|net acts upon iron. Let us be allowed this for a &s;hort time, and it will &s;oon receive almo&s;t inconte&s;tible evidence from a variety of rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>TO have an idea of this, let us begin by con&s;idering by what laws the attractive
<PB N="94" REF="108">
power of the globe, which we inhabit, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, and in fact is regulated. Let us then, fir&s;t, conceive our earth as a great &s;phere or ball, and its attracting power as i&s;&s;uing forth from all parts of it in &s;traight lines, as rays do from the &s;un, as heat from fire, or &s;mells from a perfume; in &s;hort, diffu&s;ed every way in right lines from the center of the globe under con&s;ideration. This being conceived, it is obvious, the force by which any body on its &s;urface is at|tracted, will be greater or le&s;s in propor|tion to the quantity of the attracting rays; but all rays i&s;&s;uing from a center, recede from each other, as the &s;quare of their di&s;|tance from that center encrea&s;es; that is, a body at twice the di&s;tance of another body, will be attracted only by a fourth part of the rays that attract the latter, at thrice the di&s;tance, with only a ninth part, at four times the di&s;tance, with only a &s;ix|teenth, and &s;o on. Thus if I de&s;ire to know how much a body, which at one &s;emi-diameter of the earth's di&s;tance weighs or gravitates four pound, will weigh at two
<PB N="95" REF="109">
&s;emi-diameters di&s;tance; I take the in|crea&s;ed di&s;tance two, and &s;quare it, that is, multiply the number by it&s;elf, thus, twice two is four, and then &s;ay, as this &s;quared di&s;tance is encrea&s;ed, &s;o much is the gravity or the weight of the body dimi|ni&s;hed; that is, the body weighs four times le&s;s than it did at fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> one pound. Now &s;hould it be a&s;ked how much this &s;ame body will weigh, at three &s;emi-dia|meters di&s;tance, I again take this di&s;tance three, and &s;quare it, which is nine, and then &s;ay, that the body only now weighs a ninth part of its original weight; that is, &s;ix ounces, or thereabouts. In &s;hort, to &s;ay all this in different words, the force of gravity increa&s;es in a duplicate proportion as it approaches the attracting power.</P>
<P>ALL bodies upon this earth tend to it in a line perpendicular to its &s;urface; the lighte&s;t will fall, if un&s;upported by &s;ome &s;urrounding fluid, &s;uch as air or water, as well as the heavie&s;t. The &s;moke of a candle which a&s;cends in
<PB N="96" REF="110">
the air pump, before the air is exhau&s;ted, yet upon a <HI>vacuum</HI> being made, will fall down plumb to the bottom of the receiver. If we drop a piece of gold and a feather from the top of an exhau&s;ted receiver, they will both fall to the bottom at the &s;ame time; by which it appears that a body, which is ten thou&s;and times heavier than another, yet is attracted with equal ea&s;e and celerity. The force, therefore, which has cau&s;ed the heavy body to de&s;cend, has acted upon it with ten thou&s;and times the degree of power which has been applied to move the lighter, in the &s;ame manner, as it requires ten times more &s;trength in me to lift ten books than one. Gravity, therefore, acting in proportion to the quantity of matter in all bodies, and the earth, which is almo&s;t infinitely greater than all other bodies on its &s;urface, acting with a comparatively infinite force, mu&s;t attract all to it&s;elf, with almo&s;t an infinite de|gree of &s;uperiority.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="111">BUT although the&s;e be the laws by which gravity acts, at con&s;iderable di&s;|tances from the center of the earth, yet we cannot pretend to a&s;certain them by experiment; the difference, perceivable by us at the &s;urface, is &s;o &s;mall, that it &s;carce makes any alteration in the de&s;cent of bodies. We, on the &s;urface, are di&s;|tant from the center of the earth, near four thou&s;and miles, and at the height of one mile, our di&s;tance will be four thou|&s;and and one miles; now &s;hould we re|gulate the difference of gravity by the &s;quares of the&s;e numbers, they at the &s;urface will find their gravity to be about &s;ixteen thou&s;and, and they a mile higher &s;ixteen thou&s;and and eight, a difference too &s;mall to be perceivable by our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT though this difference is not per|ceivable by us, in the de&s;cent of bodies at the &s;urface of the earth, yet when we a&s;cend to the heavenly bodies, particu|larly to the moon, which we know by the means of the tele&s;cope, to be nearer

the earth than any of the re&s;t, we &s;hall find the&s;e laws of attraction to guide it in all its motions.

If this be true, and it will &s;hortly appear that it is, the de&s;cent of bodies to the &s;urface of the earth, re|ceives a new proof of its ari&s;ing from that power we call attraction.

<P>WE &s;aid that the laws of gravity prevailed in guiding the motions of all the cele&s;tial bodies of our &s;y&s;tem; an a&s;&s;ertion which requires to be proved. However, as it is a &s;ubject which belongs rather to a&s;tronomy than natural philo&s;o|phy, we mu&s;t explain it with the utmo&s;t brevity. To enquire whether it be the &s;ame principle which guides the moon in her orbit, and makes an heavy body fall towards the &s;urface of the earth, and whether they be moved by the &s;ame laws, it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to examine what &s;pace a body falling to the earth, would move through in one minute, and what &s;pace the moon, which is &s;ixty &s;emi-diameters of the earth di&s;tant, would move through in the &s;ame time; and if they are both found regulated in &s;imilar proportions, they may both be a&s;&s;erted to ari&s;e from one &s;imilar cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="115"><HI>Newton,</HI> the great inventor of the &s;y&s;|tem, &s;et him&s;elf diligently to mea&s;ure both. He was taught that a body falling to the &s;urface of the earth, ran through &s;ixteen feet in a &s;econd, for this experi|ment had been made with exactne&s;s by <HI>Galileo</HI> before him. But in mea&s;uring the motion of the moon he had more trouble, for it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to know her pre|ci&s;e di&s;tance from the earth, and to attain a knowledge of this, it was requi&s;ite to have the exact mea&s;ure of our globe. In this he was led a&s;tray, for from wrong mea&s;ures the geographers of that time were taught to reckon but &s;ixty miles to a degree, whereas they &s;hould have reckon|ed &s;eventy; the&s;e erroneous calculations therefore, were found by <HI>Newton</HI> utterly repugnant to his &s;y&s;tem, and he was wil|ling to abandon his theory for a while, rather than force nature to conform to it. However, the true mea&s;ure of a degree being &s;ome time after found out, <HI>Newton</HI> again re&s;umed his calculations, and found them all agreeing with the utmo&s;t exact|ne&s;s

to the appearances of nature. The moon is &s;ixty &s;emi-diameters of the earth di&s;tant from us; now it is known by computation, that if the moon fell per|pendicularly towards the earth, in&s;tead of being pu&s;hed round in a circle, it would at its pre&s;ent di&s;tance begin to fall at the rate of &s;ixteen feet and an half in a minute. But in going through this &s;pace, it moves nearly thirty times &s;lower than a body falling at the &s;urface of the earth is found to do, which moves &s;ixteen feet and an half in a &s;econd. The moon, therefore, falling at its pre&s;ent di&s;tance, and the body falling at the &s;urface of the earth, fall by the &s;ame law, for the &s;quare of the moon's di&s;tance will be found exactly in proportion to the dimi|ni&s;hed force of its attraction. If the &s;tone, which falls &s;o &s;wiftly at the earth's &s;urface, were carried up as high as the moon, it would take half a minute in falling &s;ix|teen feet and an half, as the moon is now found to do.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="117">THIS law of attraction which prevails between the earth and the moon, may be extended to all the other planets, and it will be found to explain their motions with equal preci&s;ion. We &s;hall find that the attendant planets are attracted to|wards their primary planets, and that they, earth and all are attracted towards the &s;un by a force increa&s;ing as the di&s;|tance &s;quared decrea&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT it will be &s;aid, that we talk of the moon's being attracted or drawn towards the earth, and the planets to|wards the &s;un, when in fact they only move round them in circles. If the earth or the &s;un, it may be a&s;ked, attract the cele&s;tial bodies towards them&s;elves, why do they not fall upon their &s;urfaces, as we &s;ee heavy bodies fall to the &s;urface of the earth? To an&s;wer this, we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that the great Creator of all things, when he fir&s;t formed the univer&s;e, per|mitted all bodies that compo&s;e our &s;y&s;tem to be actuated by two different powers.
<PB N="104" REF="118">
One, that inert force in matter, by which, when once moved, it would con|tinue to go on in a &s;traight line for ever, if not turned out of its way by &s;ome ob&s;tacle; the other, this power of attrac|tion, by which every body tends towards &s;ome other. Now then, let us for a moment imagine that in the forming our &s;y&s;tem, the &s;un was fir&s;t made and placed in the center; after this, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the mighty Architect took this ball of earth and pu&s;hed it from him in a right-lined direction. It is obvious, that by its own inert force it would go ever &s;traight forward into endle&s;s &s;pace, if nothing hindered; but while its im|pre&s;&s;ed force drives it forward, the attrac|tion it feels from the &s;un draws it with an equal degree of force inwards; and between tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite forces it is found to go wholly in neither, but as a &s;tone whirled by a &s;ling it de&s;cribes a circle round the &s;un. That force by which a body endeavours to recede from the center of its motion, is called
<PB N="105" REF="119">
the centrifugal force, that by which it tends towards the center is called the centripetal force; they both go by one common appellation, namely, that of central forces, which, if we would have a more preci&s;e idea of the manner in which the planets revolve about the &s;un, mu&s;t be examined more mi|nutely.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Central Forces, as far as they tend to explain the Univer&s;al Sy&s;tem.</HEAD>
<P>WE have often had occa&s;ion to in|culcate, that matter is of it&s;elf entirely pa&s;&s;ive, incapable of moving it&s;elf, or &s;topping its own motion; a ball thrown by the hand would continue to go on for ever, did not the force of attraction, or the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, at la&s;t de&s;troy the motion it received from the flinger's arm. Matter, in &s;hort, follows whatever direction is impre&s;&s;ed upon it, and is af|fected by every impul&s;e in its way. As it is incapable of moving it&s;elf, &s;o it is incapable of changing the direction of its own motion, that is, it mu&s;t move forward in a &s;traight line in the direction it fir&s;t received. If then at any time we &s;ee a body moving in a circle, or any curve whatever, we conclude that it mu&s;t be acted upon by two powers at lea&s;t, one to put it into motion, and the other
<PB N="107" REF="121">
to draw it out of its rectilinear direction, in which it would have moved on for ever. Let us therefore con&s;ider the direction a moving body will receive, that is put into motion by two powers at the &s;ame time. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a boat (&s;ee fig. 6.) is drawn up the &s;tream of a river, by two men on oppo&s;ite banks and with equal force on both &s;ides; it is evident it would follow the direction of neither entirely, but go in a line be|tween both, exactly in the middle of the &s;tream.</P>
<P>TO carry this yet farther, &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip at A (&s;ee fig. 7.) driven by the wind, in the direction of the line A B, with &s;uch a force as would carry it to B in a minute. Then &s;uppo&s;e a current driving this &s;hip, at the &s;ame time, in the direc|tion A D, with an equal force. By the&s;e two forces acting together at right an|gles, the &s;hip will go in neither direction, but de&s;cribe the longer line A E C, running from corner to corner in a
<PB N="108" REF="122">
minute; or in other words, it will de&s;cribe the diagonal of a &s;quare.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e equal forces, in&s;tead of acting upon the body A (fig. 8.) at right angles, act in more con&s;piring directions, one having a tendency to drive it through the &s;pace A B, at the &s;ame time that the other has a tendency to move it through an equal &s;pace A D, it will then de&s;cribe the diagonal A G C, in the &s;ame time that either of the &s;ingle forces would have cau&s;ed it to de&s;cribe its re&s;pective &s;ide; and this, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, is a greater &s;pace than if the forces had acted upon it at right angles. Univer&s;ally there|fore, the more con&s;piring the united forces that drive a body forward are, the greater &s;pace the moving body will de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>IN a manner &s;imilar to this, bodies revolving round a center, are attracted by two powers. If a leaden bullet, fixed to the end of a &s;tring, be &s;u&s;pended upon a pin, and then receive a blow from a battledore or other in&s;trument, it will
<PB N="109" REF="123">
thereby de&s;cribe a circle about the central pin, and while its circular motion con|tinues, it will endeavour to fly off from the center; and in fact, if the &s;tring which holds it to the pin, happened to break, we &s;hould &s;ee the bullet fly off, and hit the wall, cieling, or &s;ome other part of the room; but it is held by the &s;tring, with a force equal to that by which it is drawn away; the&s;e forces, I &s;ay, are equal, for if one prevailed, the body would circulate no longer. Now the primary pu&s;h, if I may &s;o call it, which a planet has fir&s;t received, re&s;embles the blow given to the bullet; while the attraction, which draws it to the &s;un, the center of its motion, may be com|pared to the &s;tring.</P>
<P>NOW let us find out the manner of com|paring the forces of two planets revolving in circles, and this will lead us to greater preci&s;ion. As the planet, by the two forces, revolves in a circle, and as all motion is naturally rectilinear, as we proved above, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the cir|cle,
<PB N="110" REF="124">
thus de&s;cribed, as a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of right lines infinitely little; and &s;uch, in fact, are all the circles that we find in nature. Now the body which thus moves in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of right lines, would continue to go on in one of them, as in (fig. 9.) A B C D, if not continually forced down by the power which draws it to the center D. In&s;tead, therefore, of a circle, let us &s;uppo&s;e the body to move in a polygon, or a figure compo&s;ed of a number of angles, which ob&s;truct its motion as it revolves. Now it is evident, that the force with which the body moves along one of tho&s;e &s;mall right lines, will be great in proportion as the quantity of matter it contains, and the &s;wiftne&s;s with which it moves are great. And it is al&s;o evident, that the angular ob&s;tructions its force &s;urmounts in a certain time, will be numerous, in proportion as its &s;wiftne&s;s is great, and the circle, in which it moves, is &s;mall. In general, therefore, the body's central force will be great in pro|portion to its quantity of matter, to its

<P>TO illu&s;trate this by an example: &s;up|po&s;e I want to compare the central forces of two bodies of different magnitudes, different velocities, and moving in unequal circles. The fir&s;t body weighs 2, has &s;wiftne&s;s as 2, and moves in a circle, the &s;emi-diameter of which is 2. The &s;econd body weighs 3, with a &s;wiftne&s;s equal to 3, with a &s;emi-diameter of 3. I take the &s;wiftne&s;s of the fir&s;t body, and multiply it by it&s;elf thus, twice two is four. Then I multiply this by the weight 2, and the produce is 8, this I divide by the &s;emi-diameter 2, which

gives 4. What has been done to the fir&s;t body mu&s;t be done to the &s;econd, and the re&s;ult will be 9, and as 4 is to 9, the central force of one body will be to the central force of the other.</P>
<P>THIS being under&s;tood, if we apply this rule carefully we &s;hall find, 1. that if two bodies of equal weight de&s;cribe unequal circles in equal times, the central force will be greate&s;t in that which de&s;cribes a circle of the greate&s;t diameter; and of con&s;equence, if the central forces of two bodies, which de&s;cribe unequal circles, are in proportion to their diameters, the two bodies will revolve in equal times.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF two bodies de&s;cribe unequal cir|cles, their central forces will be directly as the &s;quares of the velocities, and in|ver&s;ely as their diameters.

<PB N="113" REF="128">
the central forces will be as the &s;quares of the velocities alone. And if the central forces of two bodies, which move in unequal circles, are equal, their diameters will then be as the &s;quares of the velocities.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF two bodies moving in unequal circles have equal central forces, the time employed in de&s;cribing the greate&s;t circle, will be to the time employed in de|&s;cribing the lea&s;t, in the &s;ame proportion as the cube of the greate&s;t diameter, is to the cube of the le&s;s. But if the reader con&s;iders, he will find in this ca&s;e the times and the velocities the &s;ame; but we ob&s;erved before, that the diameters are as the &s;quares of the velocities, therefore the diameters here are as the &s;quares of the times.</P>
<P>FROM hence it follows, that in com|paring the motions of the planets, and their di&s;tances from the center of their motions, this law has been e&s;tabli&s;hed,
<PB N="114" REF="129">
That the &s;quares of the periodical revolu|tions of two planets, are as the cubes of their di&s;tances from the center, round which they move.</P>
<P>THIS law is of infinite u&s;e to a&s;trono|mers; for if they know the periodical time, that is, the time of the circular revolution, of two planets, and the di&s;|tance of one of them from the center, they can by this find out the di&s;tance of the other, which before was not known. For in&s;tance, we know the periodical time of the moon to be 27 days, and the peri|odical time of the earth to be 365 days. The di&s;tance of the moon from the center of its motion we al&s;o know to be 60 &s;emi-diameters of the earth. Now I de&s;ire to know the di&s;tance of the earth from the center of its motion, namely, the &s;un? I know by my rule, that the proportion of the &s;quares of the periodical times, will give the proportion of the cubes of the di&s;tances. Then I find out the &s;quares of the periodical times of the two planets.
<PB N="115" REF="130">
The periodical time of the moon is 27, and the &s;quare of that number 729; the periodical time of the earth is 365, and the &s;quare 133225. Then I find the di&s;tance of the planet, already known, 60, and cube it, which makes 216000. Now by a rule in arithmetic, I find out a certain number which will bear the &s;ame proportion to this, that the &s;quares 729, and 133225 bear to each other; that proportional number is 39460356, and the cube root of this la&s;t number, which is 340, will expre&s;s the di&s;tance of the &s;un from the earth, which was what I wanted to know, &s;o that the earth is di&s;tant from the &s;un, 340 of its own &s;emi-diameters.</P>
<P>THIS law, of &s;uch great benefit in a&s;tronomy, was found out by <HI>Kepler,</HI> but far from being able to give the cau&s;e of it, which the reader has already &s;een; as we have taken it from <HI>Newton</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de l' Hopital. Kepler</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;un was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a kind of

vegetating &s;oul, and that turning round it&s;elf it attracted the planets, and that the planets would actually fall upon its &s;urface, but that by turning upon their own centers, (as we &s;ee a top) they by this means re&s;i&s;ted the &s;un's attracting power.</P>
<P>THE laws we have hitherto laid down &s;uppo&s;e that all the planets move in cir|cles; but in truth this is not the ca&s;e, for while they are attracted by the bodies re&s;pectively in their centers, at the &s;ame time they are in a le&s;&s;er proportion at|tracted by each other. For this rea&s;on they do not move in circular orbits, but in &s;uch as are elliptical, of the figure A in the plate, the diameter of which is greater one way than another. (Fig. 10.)</P>
<P>BY this we &s;ee, that though the uni|ver&s;e may be re&s;embled to a nice ma|chine, in which all parts are wi&s;ely adju&s;ted, yet the con&s;tant and paternal in&s;pection of the great Architect is ever

requi&s;ite, his regulating hand is always over all his works, and &s;hould he leave them but for a time, their order and re|gularity would be at an end. The planets would nece&s;&s;arily di&s;turb each others motions, and when &s;everal of them came to the &s;ame quarter of the heavens, they would attract the &s;un with united influence, and perhaps at once de&s;troy the common regulator of their motions. In this manner the uniformity of nature would be de&s;troyed, and as it could never repair its own breaches, the whole &s;y&s;tem would run into endle&s;s confu&s;ion. Of this di&s;turbance we had a remarkable in&s;tance in the comet which lately appeared; which, in receding from the &s;un, went &s;o near the planet <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as to be greatly affected by its attraction.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Figure of the Earth, and the different Weights of Bodies upon its Surface.</HEAD>
<P>EXPERIMENTAL Philo&s;ophy is not, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;o plea&s;ing as that amu&s;ing &s;cience which is formed upon conjecture; but it improves as it proceeds, and the mind, by fir&s;t more painfully mea&s;uring the effects of bodies upon each other, at la&s;t comes to arrive at the cau&s;es. We have &s;een how by means of the attraction of bodies upon each other, all nature &s;eems to put on uniformity; but this power makes the heavenly bodies not only move in circles round a di&s;tant center, but al&s;o regulates the motion of the earth upon it&s;elf. For the earth, moon, and planets have two motions, as we &s;ee &s;ometimes when boys are whipping a top, which, while it is &s;pin|ning upon it&s;elf, is at the &s;ame time go|ing round a circle chalked on the floor.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="134">THIS motion which the earth has upon it&s;elf, is that which cau&s;es day and night, as either &s;ide is turned toward, or from the &s;un. Now while the earth is thus whirling round, that part upon its &s;urface will have the greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, which is mo&s;t di&s;tant from its center of motion. As for example, a body placed upon the circumference of a chariot wheel, while it is turning, will have twenty times the motion of a body placed upon the nave. A body, if placed upon the equator of the earth, is like this body at the circumference of the wheel, while another at either of the poles, is like one placed upon the nave. Now this body placed at the equator, it is evident, would fly off, by rea&s;on of the earth's centrifugal force, with great velocity, were it not held to the earth by the infinitely &s;tronger power of attraction. However, though it &s;till holds to the earth by its gravity, yet by its centrifugal force, it in fact lo&s;es a part of its tendency to the earth, and is dimini&s;hed therefore in a part of its
<PB N="120" REF="135">
weight. Thus if weighed at the equator, a body is &s;en&s;ibly lighter than the &s;ame when weighed at either of the poles, and this has often been mea&s;ured, by the means of pendulums, in a method which &s;hall hereafter be &s;een. Let it &s;uffice here to ob&s;erve, that a body, which at <HI>Paris</HI> would weigh two hundred and twenty pounds, would at the equator only weigh two hundred and nineteen.</P>
<P>SUCH is the difference of gravity on different parts of our globe; from whence it appears, that bodies placed at the equator, have a greater tendency to fly off from the &s;urface of the earth, than &s;uch as are placed at either of the poles. Now, if in&s;tead of bodies flying off at the &s;urface of the earth, we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e the parts of the earth it&s;elf were moveable among each other, and the whole, for in&s;tance, compo&s;ed of a great heap of running &s;and; then it is obvious, that while the earth turned round its axis, her parts would attempt mo&s;t to fly off
<PB N="121" REF="136">
where the motion was greate&s;t; it would &s;well under the equator, for the greate&s;t quantity of materials would run to that part.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid here of the earth's &s;wel|ling at the equator, is actually found to be true; for though we often call it a globe, yet it is by no means perfectly round, but widened out at the equator, and flatted at both poles, like a turnip; or, if the learner is fonder of a hard name, its figure may be called an oblate &s;pheroid. A&s;tronomers and natural phi|lo&s;ophers had long been of a different opinion with regard to the figure of the earth; the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> geogra|phers univer&s;ally con&s;idered it as a &s;phe|riod rather lengthened than flatted, rather like an egg, than the figure men|tioned before. <HI>Huygens</HI> and <HI>Newton</HI> however, per&s;i&s;ted in affirming the con|trary. The di&s;pute continued long, but was at length determined, highly to the honour of the latter; &s;everal members
<PB N="122" REF="137">
of the academy of &s;ciences having been &s;ent, in 1735, to the polar circle, and others to <HI>Quito,</HI> for the purpo&s;es of de|termining the figure of the earth; they concurred in affirming with <HI>Newton,</HI> that the earth was flatted at the poles. Nor was this a &s;mall conque&s;t gained in fa|vour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> philo&s;opher's &s;y&s;tem. For it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that if the earth's figure were proved not to be flat, a part of his doctrine of gravity would be fal&s;e. For it &s;eems the earth has yet another motion; its poles are found to point &s;lowly, to different parts of the heavens, in a &s;eries of years, like a top going to fall, which while it &s;pins round it&s;elf, nods al&s;o, with a &s;ort of circular motion. Of this nutation of the poles, which it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to examine, he had &s;hewed that gravity mu&s;t be the cau&s;e, provided the earth were flat, which he believed it was.</P>
<P>BUT though the earth is allowed by the generality of modern philo&s;ophers to
<PB N="123" REF="138">
be an oblate &s;pheroid, yet &s;ome latter ob|&s;ervations have induced many of them, and tho&s;e among the foremo&s;t, to think it of a more irregular figure. Of this opinion, we find <HI>Buffon, Condamine, Maupertuis,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;covich.</HI> The prin|cipal rea&s;on upon which this opinion is founded, is, that a degree ju&s;t mea&s;ured on the meridian of the globe in <HI>Italy,</HI> by <HI>Bo&s;covich,</HI> was found to differ from that mea&s;ured in <HI>France</HI> in the &s;ame lati|tude, 70 <HI>French</HI> toi&s;es. Could we be certain that the admea&s;urements of the&s;e two different meridians were made without error, this would, undoubtedly, be a demon&s;trative proof of the irregu|larity of the earth's figure. But an error of two &s;econds will produce the difference now complained of; and where is the ob|&s;ervator that can an&s;wer for two &s;econds? The opinion therefore, of the earth's ob|late figure &s;till remains uppermo&s;t, yet not with &s;uch entire conviction, as before this la&s;t admea&s;urement was made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the De&s;cent of Bodies to the Surface of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far we have &s;hewn the ge|neral cau&s;e why bodies fall to the earth, and proved that the force of gra|vity which draws them down becomes le&s;s, as the di&s;tance, when &s;quared, be|comes greater: That a body, which at one &s;emi-diameter of the earth, weighs one pound, will have four times le&s;s weight at two &s;emi-diameters, and nine times le&s;s at three. This difference in weight, we &s;aid, might be &s;en&s;ible at great di&s;tances, but not at any di&s;tance we can remove from the earth's &s;urface; for though we could remove a mile above the earth, and weigh a body there, yet this encrea&s;ed di&s;tance would take but little from its gravity, for a body on the &s;urface of the earth, is already removed four thou&s;and miles from the center of the earth, by which it is attracted; and
<PB N="125" REF="140">
removing it one mile more will be but making a decrea&s;e of one mile's attraction from four thou&s;and, a difference too mi|nute for &s;en&s;e to di&s;cern. This decrea&s;e of gravity, therefore, as we remove from the earth, is only an object of the imagi|nation, or if we have any &s;en&s;ible proofs, they are obtained by mea&s;uring the hea|venly bodies around us.</P>
<P>IT &s;uffices us therefore to know that bodies, though to &s;en&s;e they have not more gravity in the lowe&s;t pit than upon the highe&s;t mountain, in general fall by that power. But the cau&s;e why bodies fall with greater force as they fall from higher places, which we &s;hall now &s;ee to be another law of falling bodies, is founded upon quite other principles, di&s;covered long before the principle of gravity was thought of.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t unlettered ru&s;tic is &s;en&s;ible, that the fall of a &s;tone is to be dreaded in proportion to the height from whence
<PB N="126" REF="141">
it de&s;cends; that if it falls from a place a foot above his head, it is not &s;o likely to be fatal, as if it fell from the hou&s;e-top. From this it is obvious, that the body thus falling, acquires new &s;wiftne&s;s the longer it falls; and in fact, it has been found by trial, that a leaden bullet, let fall from the top of the &s;teeple in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter Abby,</HI> acquired &s;uch velocity to|wards the end of the fall, that it pierced through a deal board that was fixed beneath.</P>
<P>THE exact quantity of &s;wiftne&s;s, which a body thus falling acquires, was fir&s;t de|mon&s;trated by <HI>Galileo,</HI> and his experi|ments confirmed by <HI>Grimaldi</HI> and <HI>Riccioli,</HI> who, by letting heavy bodies fall from high towers, and then by computing the time in which they fell, and the heights of the towers they fell from, determined the quantity of &s;wiftne&s;s gained in every in&s;tant of the fall. In determining the&s;e laws however, they &s;uppo&s;e that the bo|dies were free from that re&s;i&s;tance in
<PB N="127" REF="142">
their fall, which they receive from the air through which they move, and which re&s;i&s;ts the falling body with greater force, the quicker the body de&s;cends; as when walking we feel the wind &s;tronger when we go fa&s;t than when we move &s;low.</P>
<P>BUT though, as was &s;aid, this &s;wift|ne&s;s, which de&s;cending bodies acquire, is obvious to common experience; the exact quantity, thus acquired, is not &s;o ea&s;y to be determined. In order to find this out, we mu&s;t con&s;ider that as a body de&s;cends, the power of gravity is con|&s;tantly and uniformly increa&s;ing its &s;wift|ne&s;s; the impre&s;&s;ion gravity gives it in the fir&s;t in&s;tant of its fall, would alone be &s;ufficient to make it de&s;cend, though it received no new impre&s;&s;ion; (as a &s;tone, impre&s;&s;ed by the hand, moves &s;till forward, after the moving cau&s;e cea&s;es to act) but gravity &s;till operates upon it, and a new impre&s;&s;ion is added in the &s;econd in&s;tant of the fall, which con&s;pires with the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and doubles it;
<PB N="128" REF="143">
and in the third in&s;tant, the body goes on with the double impre&s;&s;ion, and re|ceives al&s;o a new one which triples it; &s;o that we may &s;uppo&s;e every body fall|ing, to receive a new impre&s;&s;ion every moment of the fall, and that the velocity increa&s;es as the moments increa&s;e.</P>
<P>NOW then let us imagine a bullet dropped from the tower of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby,</HI> and that in the time of one &s;econd it falls the &s;pace of one pole (&s;ixteen feet and an half,) its velocity is &s;till in|crea&s;ing; at the end of this fall it will have acquired as much &s;wiftne&s;s as in the next &s;econd would have carried it two poles, or double the former, although no new impre&s;&s;ion from gravity were added; but a new impre&s;&s;ion being added, will make it fall, through three poles. As the velocity is increa&s;ed to|wards the end of every fall, in the beginning of the third &s;econd, it will have acquired as much velocity as would have carried it through four poles, and
<PB N="129" REF="144">
the uniform impre&s;&s;ion from gravity being added, will make the body fall through a &s;pace of five poles. At the beginning of the fourth &s;econd, it will have acquired as much velocity as would have carried it through a &s;pace of &s;ix poles, and one, which is the uniform im|pre&s;&s;ion, being added, will make the body fall through a &s;pace of &s;even poles. At the beginning of the fifth &s;econd, it will have as much velocity as would have carried it through eight poles, and the new impre&s;&s;ion being added, will make it fall through nine poles. Thus in the fir&s;t &s;econd, it will fall through 1 pole, in the next 3, in the third 5, in the fourth 7, in the fifth 9 poles. All the&s;e being added together, make 25 poles, or 300 feet; &s;o that if the tower be 300 feet high, the bullet will fall from its top, in about five &s;econds. And the velo|city it will have acquired in the la&s;t &s;e|cond of the fall, will be five times greater than that which it had in the fir&s;t. Thus the, velocities, like the times, in|crea&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="145">
uniformly, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but the &s;paces, through which the body falls, taken &s;eparately and in order, increa&s;e by odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &amp;c.</P>
<P>TO prove all this by experiment: A B, and C D, (fig. 11.) are cords made of the be&s;t catgut about twelve feet long, tightly extended, parallel to each other, at &s;ome inches di&s;tance, and making an angle of about 22&frac12; with the &s;urface of the earth. G is a weight which &s;lides very freely, by means of two pulleys, along the cord A B, and its weight is &s;o contrived to fall below, that its upper part always retains the &s;ame &s;ituation. H is a pendulum of a moderate weight which moves upon two pivots <HI>A a,</HI> and its rod is lengthened a little towards <HI>f.</HI> The length of the pendulum ought to be &s;uch as to vibrate once, while the weight G, runs through the ninth part of the cord A B. To mea&s;ure this exactly, the cord &s;hould be carefully marked out into nine equal parts, and upon the other
<PB N="131" REF="146">
parallel cord, and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the fir&s;t mark, is to be fixed the little bell K, which, by means of a &s;crew, can be placed at any part of the cord at plea&s;ure; this mu&s;t al&s;o have a little clapper, which the weight G, as it runs down its own cord, may &s;trike again&s;t. On the other hand, the pendulum H al&s;o &s;trikes a bell of a different tone, and the tail of the pendulum rod that is lengthened to <HI>f.</HI> cuts as it pa&s;&s;es a &s;mall &s;ilk thread, that holds the weight G from &s;liding. In this manner the whole being well adju&s;ted, the weight G no &s;ooner begins to move, than the pendulum &s;trikes its bell I for the fir&s;t time, while the other bell K gives its &s;ound, ju&s;t as the bell I gives its &s;econd alarm. Thus between the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ound of the bell I, there intervenes a time, of which we have the exact mea&s;ure, and al&s;o we have a mea|&s;ure for the &s;pace the weight &s;lides. We then &s;crew the bell K to that place of the cord where the weight G &s;hall make the &s;e|cond &s;ound of the bell K, an&s;wer the third
<PB N="132" REF="147">
of the bell I, and thus of the re&s;t; &s;o that we may thus mea&s;ure the &s;paces run through, with the times of the de&s;cent. It will by this appear, that during the fir&s;t vibration of the pendulum, the weight G &s;hall run over a ninth part of the cord; if it continues to move for|ward during the &s;econd vibration, it will arrive at 3, and in the third vibra|tion at 5, in the fourth at 7, in the fifth at 9; &s;o that the &s;paces taken &s;eparately, go on increa&s;ing by odd numbers.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e means, if a body is let fall from a tower, and if we know the time of its falling, we are enabled to tell what velocity it has acquired in every moment of its de&s;cent, what &s;pace it has run through in each part of time taken &s;epa|rately, and how much the&s;e &s;paces make when added together; or in other words, how high the tower is, from whence the body falls.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="148">YET this height may be e&s;timated by an ea&s;ier method. For it is plain that the longer the time the body has taken to fall, and the greater the velocity with which it moves, the greater mu&s;t be the height from which it falls: now then we may multiply the time of the fall by the velocity, and the product will give us the height or &s;pace through which the body has fallen. Thus if the time a bullet has taken to fall from the top of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> tower be 5 &s;econds, and the velo|city it has acquired (which is always in|crea&s;ing as the time) be 5 times greater than in the beginning, if the bullet fell 1 pole in 1 &s;econd, (which all bodies by the force of gravity nearly do) then at the end of 5 &s;econds, it would have fallen 5 multiplied by 5, that is 25 poles, or 300 feet, the height of the tower.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid that the times and the velocities are always equal: as that is the ca&s;e, it will be more expeditious &s;till, to
<PB N="134" REF="149">
multiply the time of the bullet's fall, by the time it&s;elf, that is, &s;quare its number, and the product will give the &s;pace through which the bullet has fallen, as exactly as if the time were multiplied by the velocity. We may therefore con|clude univer&s;ally, that the whole of the &s;paces de&s;cribed by a falling body, is as the &s;quares of the times, or the &s;quare of the velocities, it is indifferent which.</P>
<P>LET us only add one po&s;ition more on this difficult &s;ubject, and we have done with its intricacies. From all that has been &s;aid, it will follow, that <HI>the velocity acquired by an uniformly accele|rated body at the end of the fall is &s;uch, as if it continued to move forward with that velocity, without any new acceleration, it would, in an equal time, move through a &s;pace double that of the fall.</HI> For the &s;pace it would de&s;cribe, &s;uppo&s;ing it went on with an accelerated motion, would be, as we proved before, as the times multiplied by the velocities; &s;o
<PB N="135" REF="150">
that by this it would have moved through three times as much &s;pace at the end of its continued motion, as it did at the end of the fall. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though the time increa&s;es, the velocity does not increa&s;e, &s;o that we are to mul|tiply the whole time of the body's mo|tion, by that part of the velocity only, which it had at the end of the fall, and the product will be the &s;pace de&s;cribed by the unaccelerated motion continued after the fall, and it will be found ju&s;t double the &s;pace de&s;cribed in the fall.</P>
<P>AS the motion of bodies falling from a &s;tate of re&s;t, is uniformly accelerated, &s;o likewi&s;e the motion of bodies thrown upward is uniformly retarded; for the &s;ame force of gravity which con&s;pires with the motion of de&s;cending bodies, acts in direct oppo&s;ition to &s;uch as a&s;cend, retarding tho&s;e that ri&s;e, as much as it accelerates tho&s;e that fall. If therefore, I &s;hould de&s;ire to throw a bullet up to the top of the tower in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> I mu&s;t give it as much velocity with my hand to
<PB N="136" REF="151">
make it ri&s;e, as it would acquire by the force of gravity if it fell from that height. The action of gravity is con&s;tant and uniform, and in whatever time it gene|rates any velocity in a falling body, in the &s;ame time mu&s;t it de&s;troy that velocity in a ri&s;ing body.</P>
<P>THESE are the celebrated di&s;coveries of <HI>Huygens,</HI> and have been employed to very u&s;eful purpo&s;es, in &s;everal of the practical parts of mechani&s;m. They &s;erve al&s;o to explain many of the phae|nomena of meteors. A hail&s;tone falling from the clouds, if uninterrupted in its de&s;cent, would &s;trike us with more than the force of &s;wan &s;hot from a gun. But in proportion as the rapidity of its de&s;cent is increa&s;ed, the re&s;i&s;tance it meets with from the air is increa&s;ed al&s;o; &s;o that at la&s;t, the acquired ve|locity and the increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance come to act with equal power; after which, the de&s;cending body can fall no fa&s;ter, but continues the &s;ame uniform pro|gre&s;s till in comes to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Bodies de&s;cending down inclined Planes, and of Pendulums.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING explained the de&s;cent of bodies falling freely by the force of gravity, it will be ea&s;y to e&s;timate the force with which they will de&s;cend down an inclined plane, (fig. 12.) in which the direction of the fall is altered, but the ab&s;olute weight remains the &s;ame.</P>
<P>WHEN a body is withheld from obey|ing the impul&s;e of gravity which always acts upon it, it is evident that it is prevented by &s;ome ob&s;tacle which re&s;i&s;ts its natural tendency to de&s;cend. For all bodies endeavour to fall by the &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e, that is to &s;ay, perpendicularly to the earth. When bodies therefore fall down inclined planes, we mu&s;t regard them as obeying the u&s;ual laws of gra|vity, as de&s;cending with an uniformly accelerated motion, but acted upon by
<PB N="138" REF="153">
new forces, only taking up &s;o much more time to de&s;cend, as the &s;pace is lengthened, over which they are obliged to fall. The more the &s;pace is in|crea&s;ed, that is, the longer the inclined plane is, the more time will the body take in travelling it down. Thus &s;up|po&s;e the inclined plane to be twice as long as its perpendicular height, then the body will be twice as long in falling, as it would if it fell from its top per|pendicularly.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew this by an experiment; let us di&s;po&s;e the cords of (fig. 13.) in &s;uch a manner, as that they &s;hall form an in|clined plane A B, which is twice as long as it is high, and then let the pendulum be &s;o adju&s;ted, that while an ivory ball is falling from A to P, it may make one vibration. If the weight G begins to &s;lide the &s;ame in&s;tant the ball is let to fall perpendicularly, it will not arrive at B till the end of the &s;econd vibration, which &s;hews that the time of its de&s;cent
<PB N="139" REF="154">
is to that of the ivory ball, as the length of the inclined plane is to its height; and if the inclined plane were three times as long, its fall would be thrice as &s;low.</P>
<P>AS the time of a body's fall is thus lengthened, in moving down an inclined plane, &s;o al&s;o will its velocity be dimi|ni&s;hed; for that quantity of force which the body has received from gravity to make it fall a certain perpendicular height, is here employed in making it de&s;cribe a &s;pace, which, by the experi|ment, is twice the length of the perpen|dicular; therefore the body will move but with half the force that it would down the perpendicular, and con&s;e|quently, with but half the velocity. As the time of a body's fall is thus lengthened in proportion to the inclina|tion of the plane, we mu&s;t now go on to ob&s;erve, that a body will take as much time in falling obliquely down the &s;hort cord of a circle M N, as it would in falling
<PB N="140" REF="155">
le&s;s obliquely down the longer cord M L, or in falling perpendicularly through the diameter M P. I repeat it, <HI>that a body will take as much time to fall down the &s;horter cord of a circle, as the longe&s;t.</HI> For bodies falling down the cord of a circle, may be con&s;idered as moving down inclined planes, as A B, A C; but all bodies moving down an inclined plane are, as we ob&s;erved, actuated by two forces; and all bodies thus actuated, move in the diagonal of a &s;quare or parallelogram. But all the diagonals thus de&s;cribed, by the united action of two forces, are always performed in equal times, and therefore all the cords of a circle are &s;o too. Thus for in&s;tance, the body takes no longer time in moving down the cord A B than it does down the cord A C, for both are diagonals de|&s;cribed by two forces that continue the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT though velocity is dimini&s;h|ed down an inclined plane, yet if
<PB N="141" REF="156">
two bodies fall from equal heights, the one perpendicularly, the other down the mo&s;t inclined plane what&s;oever, the ve|locity acquired at the end of the fall in both will be the &s;ame. For as gravity is the &s;ame in both, and is alike uniformly accelerated in either, all the increments of velocity either body receives during the fall, will be &s;ummed up in each at the end; but tho&s;e increments are equal, as they are produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e, which is gravity, and therefore the velo|cities at the end will be equal.</P>
<P>IF, in&s;tead of one inclined plane, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal united (fig. 14.) and the body moving down them one after the other, its velocity, at the end of the la&s;t plane, will be as great as it would if it fell perpendicularly from the top of the highe&s;t plane. For the velocity the body acquires at the bottom of each of the&s;e planes &s;ingly, is in pro|portion to its re&s;pective height, and con|&s;equently the &s;um of the velocities of all
<PB N="142" REF="157">
taken together, is in proportion to the &s;um of all their heights.</P>
<P>NOW if, in&s;tead of &s;everal inclined planes thus united, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the body moving in the curve of a circle, from A to B (fig. 15.) as all curves may be looked upon as a number of planes inclining one to another, the velocity a body acquires at the end of the de&s;cent, is equal to the velocity which would be acquired by falling down the perpen|dicular height.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, whatever motion bodies fall|ing freely are found to have, it is lengthened, but not dimini&s;hed, down inclining planes. If the force, which a body acquires by falling, is &s;ufficient to carry it up again to the &s;ame height from whence it fell in one ca&s;e, &s;o will it be in the other. Thus the body D, in rolling down the inclined plane A B (fig. 16.) will acquire &s;uch a velocity upon arriving at B, as will carry it up the inclined

plane B C almo&s;t to C, and would carry it quite up, if the body and plane were perfectly &s;mooth, and the air gave no re|&s;i&s;tance. And likewi&s;e the velocity of a body falling down the curve of any circle, (fig. 17.) as from C to A, will make it ri&s;e from A to D; and univer&s;ally, in whatever direction a body falls, it will, if unre&s;trained, ri&s;e to the &s;ame heights from whence it fell.</P>
<P>FROM hence we may therefore lay it down, that if, by any contrivance, a body is made to de&s;cend through the arch of a circle, as from C and A, (fig. 18.) and with the velocity acquired by the de&s;cent, to a&s;cend along the arch A D of the &s;ame circle; the arch A D which it de&s;cribes in its a&s;cent, will be equal to the arch C A de&s;cribed in the de&s;cent, and the times in which tho&s;e arches are de&s;cribed will be equal; and this is the ca&s;e of the pendulum, which is an heavy body, as A, hanging by a &s;mall cord or wire B A, and moveable about the
<PB N="144" REF="160">
point B; the weight being rai&s;ed as high as C and thence let fall, it de&s;cends by its own gravity to A, and then a&s;cends by its acquired velocity to D, where, lo&s;ing all velocity, it will be turned back by its gravity, and de&s;cending through the arch D A will, upon its arrival at A, acquire the &s;ame velocity as before, with which it will a&s;cend to C; and thus it will continue, and if uninterrupted by external ob&s;tacles, would for ever con|tinue a vibratory and equal motion.</P>
<P>THIS is that well known in&s;trument in common u&s;e for mea&s;uring of time, as nothing yet found out divides it into portions &s;o exactly equal; nor does the inequality of the arches, it may be made to de&s;cribe, make an inequality in the time of the vibration. For the vibrations of the &s;ame pendulum are performed very nearly in equal times; let it &s;wing never &s;o violently, or move never &s;o feebly, yet it performs both in equal times. We have already proved that all the cords
<PB N="145" REF="161">
of a circle are de&s;cribed in equal times, and if the cords are thus de&s;cribed, &s;o will &s;mall arches, which may be con&s;i|dered as little differing from their re&s;pec|tive cords. Thus if a body (fig. 19.) be as long a time falling down the dotted cord E A, as it is falling the longer dotted cord C A, &s;o will it be as long falling in the circle from E to A as it is from C to A; the long and the &s;hort arch will be fallen through in the &s;ame time, and they al&s;o ri&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to|wards D, in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>THE di&s;proportion in the length of two pendulums it is, which creates the great difference of time in their vibra|tions; the longer the pendulum the &s;lower are its vibrations. The cord of any pen|dulum is to be con&s;idered as proportion|able to the diameter of a circle, which the weight at the end de&s;cribes; therefore, if a body is let fall from the top of this diameter as B, (fig. 20.) and if it takes a &s;econd in falling, it will continue a &s;imilar
<PB N="146" REF="162">
time, as we have &s;hewn, in half its vi|bration C A, and another &s;econd to com|pleat its vibration in ri&s;ing up to A D; now if we &s;hould lengthen the pendulum, we &s;hould lengthen the diameter of the circle, and as con&s;equently the body will be a longer time falling down a longer diameter than a &s;hort one, &s;o will it be a longer time in de&s;cribing its re&s;pective arches.</P>
<P>AS I know that the time of half a vibration is equal to that of a body fall|ing down the diameter of its re&s;pective circle; if now I would de&s;ire to know, from what height an accelerated body would fall, during the time of one com|plete vibration, the &s;olution is ea&s;y. For as the two half vibrations are exactly equal, &s;uppo&s;ing in the fir&s;t half vibration the body fell a &s;pace of &s;ixteen feet, in the &s;econd half vibration, if the body moved equally, it would de&s;cribe a &s;pace exactly equal; but the &s;paces de&s;cribed by fall|ing bodies are increa&s;ed by odd numbers,
<PB N="147" REF="163">
1, 3, 5, and 7, &s;o that the body will de&s;cribe 3 times &s;ixteen, that is 48 feet, which added to 16, makes 64 feet, the whole time of the fall during one com|plete vibration.</P>
<P>SUCH are the mo&s;t important proper|ties of the pendulum, an in&s;trument which has been converted to the mo&s;t u&s;eful purpo&s;es, either in mea&s;uring time, and in &s;cientific affairs in giving its nicer divi&s;ions. By this in&s;trument al&s;o, we can mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of a &s;hip, by mea&s;uring the interval between the fire and the &s;ound of the gun; we can al&s;o mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of a cloud by numbering the &s;econds between the lightening and the thunder; but in both the&s;e la&s;t ca&s;es we mu&s;t know the exact time the &s;ound takes in travelling through a certain &s;pace, which we &s;hall hereafter explain. <HI>Galileo</HI> had no &s;ooner found out the&s;e properties in the pendulum, than he turned them to the advantage of philo&s;ophy; by tho&s;e he mea&s;ured, with
<PB N="148" REF="164">
&s;ome exactne&s;s, his a&s;tronomical ob&s;er|vations, and the plea&s;ure thus re&s;ulting from their u&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, recom|penced the pain of inve&s;tigating their properties. However, the pendulum he made u&s;e of could only mea&s;ure time, for he had no in&s;trument like our clock, which might &s;um up its vibrations. It was rather, in his hands, the in&s;trument of a philo&s;opher, than a thing that could be rendered univer&s;ally u&s;eful.</P>
<P>WHAT was begun by <HI>Galileo</HI> was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, improved by the in|du&s;try of <HI>Huygens,</HI> a man who added the acute&s;t penetration to the mo&s;t indefa|tigable indu&s;try. It was he, who made u&s;e of them in regulating the movement of clocks; and this happy combination has &s;ince been univer&s;ally adopted. To have an idea of the manner in which a pendulum regulates the motions of a clock, it is to be ob&s;erved, that all clocks are put into motion either by weights or &s;prings: but the wheels, if guided by
<PB N="149" REF="165">
the&s;e alone, would never turn equably, therefore the pendulum has two palates, as they are called, which at equal inter|vals ri&s;e and fall, and let the teeth of the wheels pa&s;s under them in equable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;o that the time is marked with great exactne&s;s. But this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion is, undoubtedly, the neare&s;t an equality of any thing we yet know of; however, there are &s;ome cau&s;es which de&s;troy the regularity of the motion in all clocks. We &s;aid, that all equal pen|dulums, vibrating in &s;mall arches, are performed in times nearly equal; how|ever, we mu&s;t now ob&s;erve, that the&s;e times are not entirely &s;o, for tho&s;e which de&s;cribe the greate&s;t &s;pace, are longe&s;t in performing it. This difference of time indeed, is not immediately perceivable by the &s;en&s;es, and in &s;hort durations may be neglected; but in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vibrations &s;ummed up together, it may come to a con&s;iderable amount. In fact, it has been found by experience, that the be&s;t regulated pendulum clocks, wherein the
<PB N="150" REF="166">
greate&s;t care has been taken to make the pendulums vibrate in equal arches, have notwith&s;tanding varied in a cour&s;e of time, &s;o as to &s;tand in need of a new re|gulation. And it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to make the pendulum con&s;tantly de&s;cribe &s;imilar circular arches, and con&s;equently to make its vibrations preci&s;ely equal; for if the wheels, on account of the thickening of the oil by fro&s;ty weather, or any other cau&s;e, grow more &s;luggi&s;h, this will dimini&s;h al&s;o the &s;wing of the pendulum, and therefore the length of its arches, and con&s;equently the portions of time that it is made to mea&s;ure, &s;o that the clock goes too fa&s;t. On the contrary, when the oil is thinned by heat, and the wheels thus grow more &s;lippery, or from their con&s;tant friction become more &s;mooth, &s;o as more freely to obey to the moving power, the pendulum will of cour&s;e be acted upon more forcibly, and cau&s;ed to vibrate in larger arches, by which means, the time of each &s;wing is enlarged, and of cour&s;e the clock goes too
<PB N="151" REF="167">
&s;low. This &s;ource of inequality did not e&s;cape the penetration of <HI>Huygens:</HI> to re|medy the&s;e inconveniences, he thought of another method of adapting pendulums to clocks, in which it would be ab&s;olutely indifferent whether the pendulum moved in larger or &s;maller arches; he found that if they vibrated between two curves of a geometrical figure, called a cycloid, the irregularities ari&s;ing from the altera|tions upon the pendulum, could produce no irregularity in the vibration.</P>
<P>A CYCLOID is a figure de&s;cribed by the revolution of a point in a circle, while that circle is rolling upon an even plane. Thus a nail in a chariot wheel de&s;cribes cycloids as the chariot moves along. <HI>Huygens</HI> demon&s;trated, that how|ever unequal the arches were, which a body falling in this curve might de&s;cribe, they would all be performed in equal times; for the nature of this curve is &s;uch, that a body falling down it ac|quires by velocity in the beginning,
<PB N="152" REF="168">
more than it lo&s;es in time at the end. To explain this, let us &s;uppo&s;e the fourth part of a circle A E D (fig. 21.) divided into four parts by right lines, and a body falling down them, as down &s;o many inclined planes. If the velocity were not accelerated, it is evident that the body would be a much &s;horter time in rolling almo&s;t perpendicularly from A to B, than obliquely from C to D. But the body goes with an accelerated mo|tion, and while it goes from C to D, though the plane be mo&s;t inclined, yet it performs it with the velocity which it has acquired by falling from A to C. Now it is evident, that if the planes A, B, E, were more perpendicular, the velocity through C D would be greater. The line F G H, which is the curve of a cycloid, is ju&s;t &s;uch a figure; the upper part of its curve F G D is more perpendi|cular than the arch of the circle I E D, as is obvious to the eye; and therefore the velocity acquired by the body at D, will be greater by falling from the cycloid F,
<PB N="153" REF="169">
than if it fell from the curve I. Nay what is more extraordinary, by the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the time in which the body falls from F to H, will be le&s;s than if it fell down the right line I H, though it is evidently the &s;horte&s;t way. Upon this was founded the famous problem which <HI>Bernouilli</HI> propo&s;ed to the geometricians of <HI>Europe.</HI> He demanded in what line a body, falling obliquely, would fall &s;oone&s;t to the earth? This was not a right line, though the &s;horte&s;t that could be drawn, but the curve of a cycloid, which was afterwards called by the hard name of a Brachy&s;tochrone, or the line of quicke&s;t de&s;cent.</P>
<P>IT was between two of the&s;e curves that <HI>Huygens</HI> &s;u&s;pended a pendulum, as between the curve of the cycloid C A and the curve F B, (fig. 22.) might be &s;u&s;pended the pendulum C V, in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;trings which hold the pendulum, as often as it moves from the perpendicular towards either &s;ide, might
<PB N="154" REF="170">
bend round either curve, and by this al&s;o the pendulum would de&s;cribe another curve of a cycloid A V B. By the&s;e means he &s;uppo&s;ed that the curve A V B being &s;imilar to the other two curves, would de&s;cribe all its vibrations in equal times, and thus communicate a perfect regu|larity in clocks. However, experi|ence and theory have evinced the contrary.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;eems mo&s;t remarkable in the error of <HI>Huygens</HI> is, that the learned of <HI>Europe</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in the error for more than thirty years, notwith&s;tanding the irregularities that this produced in the movements of clocks. One while they attributed it to the inaccuracy or igno|rance of the arti&s;t; another time to the ob&s;truction of &s;ome phy&s;ical cau&s;es; Mr. <HI>Sully</HI> was the fir&s;t who undeceived them. He &s;hewed that the regularity of cycloidal pendulums was ob&s;tructed upon a very &s;ufficient account; namely, the flexibility of the rod or &s;tring of the pendulum, which
<PB N="155" REF="171">
it mu&s;t have had to bend along the curve on either &s;ide, and which altered the weight of the pendulum upon the work to be regulated. Another &s;ufficient rea&s;on again&s;t cycloidal pendulums is, the moi&s;ture which the &s;ilken &s;trings im|bibe from the air; whereas in other pendulums a &s;teel rod is made u&s;e of, which is not &s;ubject to equal variations. In &s;hort, the&s;e kind of pendulums are now entirely out of u&s;e; however, it is po&s;&s;ible they may again be brought into fa&s;hion, &s;ince a late improvement in one of the movements of a clock by <HI>Le Roy,</HI> in which the cycloidal pen|dulum may be u&s;ed with advantage.</P>
<P>SUCH are the a&s;&s;i&s;tances which geome|tricians have brought to regulate the vi|bration of pendulums, and to make all the arches they de&s;cribe equal; but there are other natural cau&s;es of irregularity, which are entirely irremediable by calculation. As the rod of the pendulum, like all other bodies, contracts with cold, and dilates
<PB N="156" REF="172">
with heat; &s;o it mu&s;t in cold wea|ther be con&s;iderably &s;horter than in hot weather, and con&s;equently its vibrations mu&s;t be &s;wifter in winter when it is colde&s;t than in the heats of &s;ummer. It was a &s;u&s;picion of this kind that induced &s;ome to think, that as the pendulum at the equator was found to move much &s;lower than the &s;ame pendulum towards the poles, this might proceed from its being lengthened by the heat of the cli|mate. In this however they were de|ceived, for its &s;lowne&s;s there (as we ob|&s;erved before) proceeds from its having a greater centrifugal force, which thus makes the force of gravity le&s;s at the equator, than towards the poles. I &s;ay, they were deceived in this; for it has ap|peared by the mo&s;t careful experiments, that the lengthening of the pendulum in the hotte&s;t weather, bears no &s;ort of pro|portion to the &s;lowne&s;s with which the pendulum at the equator is found to move. Mr. <HI>Mairan</HI>'s pendulum at <HI>Paris</HI> required to be 3 <HI>French</HI> feet, 8 lines and an half, to vibrate &s;econds. This pendu|lum,
<PB N="157" REF="173">
by every experiment that has been tried to make it vibrate &s;econds at the equator, mu&s;t be 2 lines &s;horter. Now if the air at <HI>Paris</HI> were as hot as boiling water, yet it could not require the pen|dulum to be made the third of a line &s;horter, &s;o that the heat at the equator is not the only rea&s;on that makes it too long to vibrate &s;econds there, &s;ince the heat alone could not increa&s;e its length above a third part of what we find it.</P>
<P>THE lengthening of the rod of a pen|dulum by heat, and its contraction by cold, are inconveniences however which &s;ome mechanics have attempted to ob|viate, by employing another piece of metal in the movements of the machine, which &s;hall counteract the lengthening or &s;hortening of the pendulum, by its own dilatation or contraction. Mr. <HI>Har|ri&s;on</HI>'s machine is made upon this princi|ple, <HI>Le Roy</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> have publi&s;hed treati&s;es upon this &s;ubject: it is our duty in &s;o ample a &s;ubject, to excite curio&s;ity rather than to gratify it.</P>

<P>ANY body thrown off, either from the hand, or &s;hot forward by the force of powder or any other means, is called a projectile.

After this it will cea&s;e to a&s;cend; for in the third &s;econd, gravity will have the advantage over the projectile force of the racquet, for the racquet gives only 60 feet in a &s;econd, whereas gravity would give at the third &s;econd 5 times its fir&s;t force, that is, the body will de&s;cend at the rate of 80 feet; for the &s;paces de&s;cribed by bodies fall|ing by the force of gravity increa&s;e by the odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &amp;c. from this it appears that the projectile force is uniformly dimini&s;hed, and that a body thrown perpendicularly upwards al&s;o falls perpendicularly down, or at lea&s;t to all appearance.</P>

If the ball F, during the fir&s;t &s;econd, falls 1 <HI>a</HI> by its force of gravity, during the next &s;econd, the cau&s;e increa&s;ing by odd numbers, will make it fall 3 times as low, to 2 <HI>c</HI>; in the third &s;econd it will fall 5 times as much, to 3 <HI>c,</HI> and in the fourth &s;econd it will fall 7 times as much, to 4 <HI>g.</HI> By this means we &s;hall have a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of points, F a c e g, which together form a curve, which geometricians call a <HI>Parabola.</HI> And in this curve all pro|jected bodies will move, in what&s;o|ever direction they are thrown, except directly upward, or perpendicularly downward.</P>
<P>NOW &s;hould it be a&s;ked in what manner a cannon &s;hould be planted in order to drive a ball to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;tance,
<PB N="161" REF="178">
the &s;olution will be obvious. For if we &s;uppo&s;e it rai&s;ed perpendicularly as B, (fig. 25.) it is evident that the ball &s;hot from its mouth will fall perpen|dicularly back again, to the &s;ame &s;pot from whence it was driven. And if we &s;uppo&s;e the cannon laid level with the &s;urface of the earth at A, it is evident that the ball can be &s;hot to but a very &s;hort di&s;tance; for as it de&s;cribes the curve of a parabola, and con&s;equently is every moment de&s;cending, &s;trictly &s;peaking, it would reach the ground the moment of the explo&s;ion. To give therefore a ball the greate&s;t amplitude, and to drive it to the greate&s;t random di&s;tance, we mu&s;t point the cannon exactly between the horizontal direction A, and the perpen|dicular direction B; that is, we mu&s;t elevate it to about forty five degrees of a circle, or the half of its quadrant C; and every day's experience in gunnery confirms the truth of this theory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the Communication of Motion.</HEAD>
<P>NATURAL philo&s;ophy, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is little el&s;e but the mea|&s;uring of &s;uch motions as are obvious, or accounting for &s;uch as proceed from an hidden cau&s;e. We have already ac|counted for and mea&s;ured the motions of bodies, that to the vulgar &s;eem to put them&s;elves into action, or, that put into action by us, go on without communi|cating their motion to any others: of the fir&s;t &s;ort, were bodies attracting each other; of the la&s;t were projected bodies, that were &s;uppo&s;ed to meet with no ob|&s;truction in their way.</P>
<P>WE now come to con&s;ider that mo|tion, which is communicated from one body to another, without con&s;idering the fir&s;t cau&s;e which gave that motion to either. If upon &s;eeing two bodies in motion, I apply my &s;trength to &s;top
<PB N="166" REF="183">
either, I will naturally and ju&s;tly con|clude that body to have had mo&s;t force, which required mo&s;t of my force to &s;top it. Now there are two things by which a body acquires this &s;uperior force; it either moves very &s;wiftly, or the body moving is very heavy: in either ca&s;e it requires very great force to &s;top it, but mo&s;t of all, if it is at once both &s;wift and heavy. A tennis ball, though it moves very &s;wiftly, will give but a moderate blow; a leaden bullet, moving with equal &s;wiftne&s;s, would be fatal. The force therefore, with which a body moves, is in proportion to its &s;wiftne&s;s and weight: or, to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing in harder words, the <HI>momentum</HI> (for &s;o is the force u&s;ually called) is compounded of the quantity of matter in a body and velocity united. If then at any time we de&s;ire to know the force with which a body moves, it is but multiplying the velocity by the weight, or the weight by the velocity, and the product is the force &s;ought for. So that by this we &s;ee that
<PB N="167" REF="184">
two bodies may go on with very different degrees of &s;wiftne&s;s, and yet both move with the very &s;ame force, provided the difference of their weights balances this exce&s;s. Thus, &s;uppo&s;e a bomb to weigh 40 pounds, and to move 2 miles in a minute; and a cannon ball to weigh 4 pounds, and move 20 miles in the &s;ame time. If I would know which will &s;trike down a parapet with greater force, I multiply 40 pounds, which is the weight of the bomb, by 2, which is its &s;wift|ne&s;s, and that makes its force 80. Then I do the &s;ame by the cannon ball, and 20 multiplied by 4, gives 80; &s;o that the force in both is equal, and either would level the parapet with equal force. Once again therefore, I repeat it, that <HI>the force or momentum of any moving body is found, by multiplying its velocity by its weight.</HI></P>
<P>TO prove this another way: if it &s;hould be &s;aid that bodies, which move with equal &s;wiftne&s;s, will al&s;o move with
<PB N="168" REF="185">
equal force; &s;uppo&s;e I threw any body forward, and by the time it got to &s;ome di&s;tance it &s;hould divide into four dif|ferent parts, the&s;e would &s;till move to the end of the ca&s;t with as much &s;wift|ne&s;s as the body would if it had remained entire; but it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay that the&s;e parts move each with as much force, &s;ince if &s;o, the force in the four parts would be four times greater than what was at fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed upon the body, &s;o that to put it into motion, the effect would be greater than the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL this is apparent, and was well known to <HI>Archimedes</HI>; but notwith&s;tand|ing, obvious as it is, <HI>Leibnitz</HI> and his followers in&s;i&s;t that the force of a body is to be e&s;timated, not by multiplying the weight by the velocity, but by the &s;quares of the velocity. Thus <HI>Archi|medes</HI> would &s;ay, that a ball which weighs 2 and moves 2, would go on with a force 4; but <HI>Leibnitz</HI> contradicts him, and &s;ays that a ball which weighs
<PB N="169" REF="186">
2 and moves 2, will go on with a force 2, multiplied by the &s;quare of the velo|city 2, which is 8.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion in di&s;pute therefore is, whether the force of a moving body becomes double or becomes quadruple, when the &s;wiftne&s;s is only doubled? Now were the force employed in de&s;troy|ing its motion, allowed as a proper mea&s;ure to e&s;timate the force, with which the moving body went forward, the que&s;tion would &s;oon be at an end, and the followers of <HI>Leibnitz</HI> mu&s;t &s;ubmit; for to de&s;troy the motion of any body what|&s;oever, we have only to oppo&s;e to it an equal weight to its own, multiplied by an equal velocity. Suppo&s;e a ball of 2 pounds moves forward with a &s;wiftne&s;s of 2 yards in a minute; if I de&s;ire to &s;top it with another ball which weighs 2 pounds, this I can effectually perform if I give the la&s;t ball, which has already as much weight, as much &s;wiftne&s;s as the former. This &s;hews that if the
<PB N="170" REF="187">
force de&s;troyed in one body, be equal to that de&s;troying in the other, the moving force mu&s;t originally have been as the weights multiplied &s;imply by the velocity, and not as the &s;quares.</P>
<P>THE &s;trength of this objection <HI>Leibnitz</HI> was aware of, and therefore an&s;wered it by making a di&s;tinction. The force &s;ufficient, &s;ays he, in one body to de|&s;troy another body's motion, I grant, is rightly mea&s;ured by the weight multi|plied by the velocity; but the force with which a body &s;urmounts ob&s;tacles, is to be e&s;timated differently from that in which it is overcome by them. A body moving forward, becomes in a manner <HI>animated</HI> on its way, and when once put forward, overcomes ob&s;tacles that would have been in&s;urmountable to its force at the very in&s;tant it began; as a man will overcome difficulties, when in his heat, that in his cool moments would be in&s;urmountable. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a body, with a certain degree of
<PB N="171" REF="188">
weight and &s;wiftne&s;s, is able to coil up a watch &s;pring; if I double the weight alone it will coil up but two watch &s;prings, but if on the contrary I double the velocity alone, it will coil up four. Thus then, continues <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> we have two kinds of forces; dead forces, which are as the weight multiplied by the velocity; and animated forces, which are as the weight multiplied by the &s;quares of the velocity. The dormant force which a body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es while counter|acted by &s;ome other, is the dead force; that of a body actually put into motion, the animated. An arrow drawn to the head and ju&s;t &s;tarting from the bow, is a dead force withheld by the archer's hand, with a power that would, upon computation, appear to be equal to a certain weight multiplied by a certain velocity; but when the arrow is once &s;hot forward, then the animated force begins, and with a power, made up of the ar|row's weight and the &s;quare of its velocity. Whatever totally de&s;troys the
<PB N="172" REF="189">
animated force, turns it into a dead one, and it therefore yields to an in&s;urmount|able ob&s;tacle in the &s;ame manner as a dead force would do. But it is other|wi&s;e when &s;light ob&s;tacles are overcome; for &s;uch are pa&s;t over with a force, as the &s;quares of the velocities multiplied by the weight of the body in motion. We mu&s;t not therefore, concludes <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> e&s;timate the force of a body in motion, by com|puting the force which would be &s;uffi|cient to de&s;troy that motion; &s;ince a moving body &s;urmounts ob&s;tacles with a much greater force, than that by which its force is de&s;troyed by in&s;urmountable ones.</P>
<P>SUCH is the doctrine of <HI>Leibnitz</HI> upon the forces of bodies which impell each other; by which we &s;ee that he was of opinion that a body, who&s;e &s;wiftne&s;s was twofold, would have four times the force of one which only went forward with a &s;ingle velocity. But however re&s;pectable the name of <HI>Leibnitz</HI> may be, there are
<PB N="173" REF="190">
among his adver&s;aries, names &s;till more re&s;pectable, for <HI>Newton</HI> and <HI>Clarke</HI> are of the number. We grant, &s;aid they, that four watch &s;prings will be coiled up by a body with a double velocity, and nine &s;prings by a triple, and &s;o on; but as you di&s;tingui&s;hed once, &s;o now mu&s;t we. Between the fir&s;t in|&s;tant that the body begins to coil the &s;pring, and the la&s;t, in which the work is completely performed, however quick it may appear to &s;en&s;e, yet there pa&s;&s;es &s;ome time. Now if we con&s;ider the effect of the coiling body at the end of the time, it will certainly produce a force as the &s;quares of the velocities, and <HI>Leibnitz</HI> is in this re&s;pect right; but if, on the contrary, we could e&s;timate the force, at the commencement of the coil, it would be &s;imply as the velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;pute, which is not even yet perfectly determined, has for more than &s;ixty years divided the learned of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;harpened &s;ome even into animo&s;ity;
<PB N="174" REF="191">
however, it is only a debate merely &s;pe|culative, and may be reduced to this frivolous que&s;tion; namely, Whether the ob&s;tacle, a moving force &s;urmounts, re&s;i&s;ts in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion its parts oppo&s;ing, one after the other; or whether its re&s;i&s;tance is in&s;tantaneous, all its parts oppo&s;ing together? Which ever of the&s;e happens, the effect is to be mea&s;ured in the &s;ame manner, only one takes in the time of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the other not.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this di&s;pute therefore, we may &s;till continue to mea&s;ure the quantity of force in moving bodies, by their weight multiplied by their velocity; we go on therefore to ob|&s;erve, that whatever be the action of a body thus moving upon another, that other exerts an equal re-action upon it. If the moving body takes three degrees of force, to drive forward a body at re&s;t, this quie&s;cent body employs three degrees of force, to keep the other back. If I pre&s;s a &s;tone with my finger downward, the &s;tone pre&s;&s;es my finger equally up|ward.
<PB N="175" REF="192">
If a hor&s;e draws a load forward, as much as he promotes the progre&s;s of the load, &s;o much is he retarded, or in other words drawn back; and whatever motion he communicates to the load, he lo&s;es &s;o much of his own. In a word, the re-action of any body what&s;oever, is equal to the action employed in put|ting it into motion.</P>
<P>AS action and re-action are thus equal, it is manife&s;t that in the &s;troke one body makes upon another, the motions of both mu&s;t be equally affected by the blow; and whatever additional motion the one receives, the other mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;o much that gave it; whatever the one imparts, &s;o much mu&s;t the other be a gainer.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e two principles united, namely, that the force of bodies is made up of their &s;wiftne&s;s and weight mul|tiplied by each other, and that action and reaction are equal, depends the laws
<PB N="176" REF="193">
of the communication of motion; laws which ancient philo&s;ophy had never &s;up|po&s;ed to exi&s;t, and in which more mo|dern philo&s;ophers were for a long time mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>HOW one body becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power of granting its motion to another, how matter, which is it&s;elf inert, &s;hould be capable, when moved, of communi|cating its activity; the&s;e are que&s;tions which we may a&s;k, but can never re|&s;olve; perhaps our wi&s;e&s;t an&s;wer will be, with <HI>Malbranche,</HI> to &s;ay, that <HI>God</HI> has willed it to be &s;o. But though we are ignorant of the cau&s;e of its motion, yet, by certain laws, we can readily tell the preci&s;e quantity of motion (or let us call it force) which one body communicates to another, provided we know the weights of the two bodies, and their &s;wiftne&s;s before they impinged.</P>
<P>IF we could &s;uppo&s;e all bodies perfectly hard, it is manife&s;t, that if thus circum|&s;tanced,
<PB N="177" REF="194">
any two of them &s;hould &s;trike again&s;t each other in an even direction, they would never &s;eparate after the &s;troke, but either remain together im|moveable, or go forward together with one common and equal &s;wiftne&s;s. For what is it that could &s;eparate them? They cannot recoil from each other, for this would imply that their parts gave way, which they cannot do, as the bodies are &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfectly hard, and there|fore unyielding. They cannot be &s;epa|rated by the air, or any other external re&s;i&s;tance, for the&s;e, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be removed. If two per|fectly hard bodies therefore &s;trike again&s;t each other, if they move after the &s;troke, they both move together the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>ALL bodies perfectly hard may be called non-ela&s;tic bodies; the&s;e, after the &s;troke, never &s;eparate from each other, but either remain together immoveable, or go on with one common velocity.
<PB N="178" REF="195">
The quantity of force they communicate or receive from each other, may be deter|mined in the manner following. <HI>If two non-ela&s;tic bodies meet in oppo&s;ite directions, the exce&s;s of force in one of them, before they &s;trike, will be all that is left in both after, and this being di&s;tributed between them, in proportion to their weights, will tell us the force with which each moves after the &s;troke.</HI> For all the re&s;t was de&s;troyed by their contrary and equal actions upon each other.</P>
<P><HI>If one body in motion pur&s;ues and &s;trikes another, which is either at re&s;t or in motion, both bodies, after the &s;troke, will have all the force they had before, but then di&s;tributed between each, in proportion to their weights.</HI> For in this ca&s;e there is no contrary agent to de&s;troy their con|&s;piring forces; and as they both move to|gether with equal &s;wiftne&s;s, from their want of ela&s;ticity, the force of either mu&s;t be computed by its re&s;pective weight, their velocity being the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="196">THESE are the great laws found out by Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren,</HI> for mea&s;uring the quantity of force communicated or de&s;troyed by the mutual percu&s;&s;ion of non-ela&s;tic bodies; and we can, with great ea&s;e, apply tho&s;e rules to any par|ticular ca&s;es that may be &s;tated; as when one body is only in motion at the time of the &s;troke, or when both move in the &s;ame direction; when they move in op|po&s;ite directions, and this with equal or unequal force, or unequal weight. Any of the&s;e ca&s;es, I &s;ay, may be very ea&s;ily &s;olved, by applying to the rules above mentioned. I &s;hall only therefore take any one of them as an example at a ven|ture, for as it is a bu&s;ine&s;s rather of calcu|lation than curio&s;ity, &s;uch learners as are delighted with &s;tudies of this nature, will very ea&s;ily &s;olve the re&s;t them&s;elves. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then two bodies of un|equal weight, both moving, and the one overtaking the other. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the weight of the preceding body to be one pound, and let it have three degrees of
<PB N="180" REF="197">
velocity, &s;o that its force will be three. Again, let us &s;uppo&s;e the pur&s;uing body to weigh two pound, and to have a velocity of &s;ix degrees, &s;o that its force will be twelve. Now I de&s;ire to know with what degree of force the&s;e two bodies will proceed after one has &s;truck the other? Fir&s;t then, according to my rule, I find the force in both bodies before the &s;troke, which is three, and twelve, and that makes fifteen. Now this I di&s;tribute between the two bodies, after the &s;troke, giving to each in propor|tion to its weight. The fir&s;t weighs one, the la&s;t two; therefore the force in the fir&s;t body, after the &s;troke, will be five, and the force in the la&s;t body, after the &s;troke, will be ten. Now if I de&s;ire to know what force was communicated by the &s;triking body to the &s;maller; the force of the &s;maller body before the &s;troke was three, and after the &s;troke five; therefore the motion it received by com|munication was two.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="198">AND what is thus found exact in theo|ry, will be found nearly true in experi|ment. I &s;ay only nearly true, for in the whole circle of nature there is not to be found a body perfectly non-ela&s;tic, and the philo&s;opher in this ca&s;e, is obliged to be content with employing in his experi|ments, &s;uch bodies as are mo&s;t void of ela&s;ticity. If bodies were perfectly hard, they would be perfectly non-ela&s;tic, as their parts, upon pre&s;&s;ure, would never give way; but as in nature tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances we meet with that have hardne&s;s, have great ela&s;ticity al&s;o; the natural philo&s;opher, in his experiments upon non-ela&s;tic bodies, in&s;tead of u&s;ing unyielding hard bodies, as they are not to be met with, is obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;oft bodies that are non-ela&s;tic from a different principle; they yield to pre&s;&s;ure, but do not recover them&s;elves with a &s;pringy or ela&s;tic force.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tances, u&s;ually employed in experiments upon non-ela&s;ticity, are balls
<PB N="182" REF="199">
made of moi&s;t clay, and &s;u&s;pended by fine &s;trings, as we u&s;ually &s;ee pendulums. The&s;e are let fall from certain heights, and the time they take to pa&s;s through the&s;e heights is con&s;idered as their velo|city. With the&s;e the experiments are found to an&s;wer nearly to the theory; their &s;till having a &s;mall degree of ela&s;tic force, and the re&s;i&s;tance given by the air, cau&s;es the deviation.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e we can experimentally be convinced, that bodies, when they hold a certain proportion, are moved, and remove each other in equal proportion. But it is otherwi&s;e if the difference of the two bodies be very great; if I &s;trike a clay ball again&s;t the wall of an hou&s;e, the wall remains unmoved as before, or the motion is &s;o infinitely &s;mall, that &s;en&s;e is not capable of di&s;cerning it. And this may &s;erve to refute the noted opinion of the Epicurean &s;ects, that no motion was ever lo&s;t in the world, but that what was once begun, though it
<PB N="183" REF="200">
cea&s;ed in the fir&s;t body that received it, yet it was only by its being tran&s;mitted to another, but not actually de&s;troyed. It is true, they may reply, that though motion be infinitely dimini&s;hed, yet this is not equivalent to its being actually de|&s;troyed. Much might be &s;aid upon this que&s;tion, but we will pa&s;s it over, as a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of it would be a matter of u&s;e to none, and a matter of curio&s;ity only to metaphy&s;icians.</P>

By ela&s;ticity, I mean that &s;pring or power with which we find many bodies, when pre&s;&s;ed, re&s;tore them&s;elves, as &s;oon as that pre&s;&s;ure which bent their parts to|gether is taken away. Thus a watch &s;pring, which, when coiled up, unfurls it&s;elf as &s;oon as at liberty, may be called ela&s;tic; marble, which, when &s;truck again&s;t the pavement, rebounds to &s;ome height, may be called ela&s;tic. No body on earth, even water, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its proper place, is entirely without this power, and yet no body in nature has this power in perfection. To be per|fectly ela&s;tic, the body mu&s;t re&s;tore it&s;elf with a force exactly equal to the pre&s;&s;ure made upon it. The marble, if dropt from an height of three feet, to be perfectly
<PB N="185" REF="202">
ela&s;tic, mu&s;t ri&s;e to the height of three feet. It falls to the pavement, is pre&s;&s;ed inwards by the fall; if it recovered from that pre&s;&s;ure with equal force, it would ri&s;e as high as it fell. But no body is found to do this completely; an ivory ball is the mo&s;t ela&s;tic body that we know of, and &s;uch are u&s;ed in all the ex|periments upon this &s;ubject. But before we begin to mea&s;ure the efforts of this ela&s;tic power, it will not be ami&s;s to en|quire from whence the power it&s;elf proceeds.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE I hold, by one end, a bit of catgut moi&s;tened, between my fingers, and lengthen it by pulling at the other; this, when let free, will again &s;horten it&s;elf as before it was drawn. Now it is required to explain what power it is, which thus &s;hortens the &s;tring which I had lengthened? A common ob&s;erver would &s;ay, that it &s;hortens it&s;elf, that the fibres of the &s;tring which were lengthened by force, when that force is removed, again
<PB N="186" REF="203">
re&s;ume their natural &s;tate. But what is the natural &s;tate of its fibres? Mere matter is intirely inert and pa&s;&s;ive, and the fibres in one &s;ituation, are as natu|rally placed as in any other. There mu&s;t therefore be &s;ome other power, that thus impells tho&s;e fibres again to contract; and what that power is, is what philo&s;o|phers enquire.</P>
<P>TO &s;olve this que&s;tion, a <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> will &s;ay, that by lengthening the &s;tring we le&s;&s;en its pores, and thus &s;queeze a cer|tain &s;ubtile fluid, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in all bodies, into a narrower compa&s;s, which by its endeavouring to fly out, will pro|duce an endeavour in the body to re&s;ume its form. This &s;olution, is a more incom|prehen&s;ible difficulty, than that which it is brought to explain.</P>
<P>OTHER philo&s;ophers, at the head of whom is <HI>Malebranche,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that all bodies are filled with little vortexes, which, like watch &s;prings coiled, give
<PB N="187" REF="204">
way to pre&s;&s;ure, but re&s;tore them&s;elves upon its removal. This is only &s;uppo&s;|ing one kind of ela&s;ticity that we do not &s;ee, to prove another that we do &s;ee.</P>
<P>THE followers of <HI>Newton</HI> &s;ay, that this power is nothing el&s;e but that of attraction. When the &s;tring is length|ened, &s;ay they, its parts are not however drawn out of the &s;phere of each other's attraction, by which they were held toge|ther; and as &s;oon as the power that lengthens the &s;tring is removed, and the attracting parts are permitted to re&s;ume their functions, they again attract and contract the parts to their former &s;itu|ations, and the &s;tring &s;hortens as in the beginning. A &s;ingle que&s;tion will &s;erve to invalidate this &s;olution. Why then are not heavy bodies, which have mo&s;t parts, and &s;hould have con&s;equently mo&s;t attraction, the mo&s;t endowed with ela&s;ticity?</P>
<P>WHAT the cau&s;e is therefore, that a body, when thus lengthened, recovers
<PB N="188" REF="205">
its former &s;hortne&s;s when the length|ening force is taken away, as yet appears in&s;crutable. All that we know is, the actual exi&s;tence of the experiment; and perhaps this is as much as is worth our knowing. Now methodically to &s;hew that a &s;tring may be lengthened, and yet recover its former &s;hortne&s;s, the follow|ing experiment will &s;erve. If the &s;tring of a fiddle or an harp&s;ichord, (fig. 26.) be &s;tretched between two fixed points, G, H, and let it be &s;truck upon by a &s;olid body, &s;ufficient to bend it from the point from I to K; it is evident that this &s;troke will lengthen the &s;tring, for the line G K H, is obviou&s;ly longer than the &s;treight &s;tring G H. The &s;tring there|fore is lengthened by the &s;troke, and were it perfectly void of ela&s;ticity, it would continue lengthened.</P>
<P>NATURE however has endued the &s;tring with an ela&s;tic power, a power which will induce it to &s;horten, and re|&s;tore
<PB N="189" REF="206">
it&s;elf with nearly as much force, as that of the body that gave the &s;troke. So that therefore being lengthened to K, as I &s;aid before, it will, by its ela&s;ticity, return back to I. Now the velocity which it acquired by coming from K, being in proportion to the ela&s;tic force which acts continually, will be continually accele|rated, and will drive the &s;tring in the oppo&s;ite direction to L. The ela&s;tic power may in this ca&s;e be re&s;embled to the gravitating power which we formerly de&s;cribed in the pendulum; where we &s;hewed, that whatever heights the vibra|ting body falls from on one &s;ide, &s;o much will it ri&s;e on the other. In this manner will the ela&s;tic &s;tring continue to vibrate from one &s;ide to the other for &s;ome time, and if perfectly ela&s;tic, and not re&s;i&s;ted externally, would continue to vibrate for ever. And what is re|markable enough, each of its little vibra|tions, like tho&s;e of a pendulum, will be performed in times exactly equal to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="207">THE very &s;ame thing that is here de|mon&s;trated concerning &s;trings, will be found true of all other ela&s;tic bodies what&s;oever; like the&s;e, their parts give way, recover, and put them&s;elves into a vibratory motion. Let us, for in&s;tance, take a &s;mall bell or drinking gla&s;s, and ring them at the edge with the finger; the &s;troke of the finger pre&s;&s;es the edge of the gla&s;s, and for that in&s;tant alters its form; from a circle it becomes an ellip&s;e, in form of the dotted circle A B, (fig. 27.) but upon the pre&s;&s;ure being removed, it in&s;tantly recovers its former figure, and the re&s;titutive force acting upon it con&s;tantly, it will acquire &s;uch an ac|celerated velocity, as to drive it into the oppo&s;ite ellip&s;e C D. Thus will it continue to vibrate backward and forward, from one ellip&s;e into the other, till the re&s;i&s;t|ances it hath to encounter, from its non-ela&s;ticity, and from the external air, en|tirely de&s;troy its motion.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner will other ela&s;tic bodies change their figure, making allow|ances
<PB N="191" REF="208">
for the &s;tiffne&s;s and uncompliancy of their matter or figure. The parch|ment of a drum becomes alternately con|cave and convex; an ivory billiard ball, let fall upon earth-&s;tone, becomes an ellip&s;oide by the fall, but &s;oon alters its figure again.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it may be thus objected: How do we know, that an ivory ball, which to all appearance is compo&s;ed of parts &s;tiff and uncomplying, does thus yield to the impre&s;&s;ion, and then recover its former figure? An experiment will prove that it yields. Let a &s;mooth mar|ble hearth-&s;tone, or &s;uch like, be &s;meared &s;lightly over with oil, and then let an ivory ball be dropped upon it, and it will leave a pretty broad &s;pot upon the &s;tone. Now it will be owned, that this ball upon the fall would touch the marble only in a &s;ingle point if it were inflexible, but by yielding, it levels a part of its &s;urface to the pre&s;&s;ure it receives from the &s;urface of marble, and marks it with the im|pre&s;&s;ion as before.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="209">FROM hence we may gather, that all ela&s;tic bodies, how different &s;oever their figure, yet exert this force in the &s;ame manner; that an ela&s;tic &s;tring and an ela&s;tic ball re&s;i&s;t pre&s;&s;ure ju&s;t alike, and take the &s;ame methods to recover their former &s;hapes. And from hence we may infer, that an ela&s;tic &s;tring or body, when lengthened or dilated, recovers its former ten&s;ion with an accelerated velocity: thus the &s;tring in returning from K, was uniformly accelerated till it came to I: thus in the figure repre&s;enting a bow &s;tring, the arrow would not quit the bow till the &s;tring arrived at the middle point, where it acquired its greate&s;t velocity.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn the manner in which an ela&s;tic body re&s;i&s;ts pre&s;&s;ure, it is now time to mea&s;ure the quantity of motion received and communicated by ela&s;tic bodies that &s;trike each other; and as it is impo&s;&s;ible to throw that degree of per&s;picuity into this &s;ubject which I could wi&s;h in the compa&s;s to which I have
<PB N="193" REF="210">
confined my&s;elf, I &s;hall adopt <HI>Hel&s;ham</HI>'s manner, which, though &s;ome may think difficult, is allowed to be the be&s;t and plaine&s;t yet publi&s;hed. In e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the theory of which we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the bodies perfectly ela&s;tic, and all ex|ternal re&s;i&s;tance from the air taken away. In the &s;hock of ela&s;tic bodies, nature follows the very &s;ame laws as in that of non-ela&s;tic bodies, but with this differ|ence, that ela&s;tic bodies fly off after the &s;hock with as much force as that with which they came together, whereas if they were non-ela&s;tic, they would de&s;troy each other's motion entirely. The rule for determining the quantity of force in ela&s;tic bodies, after the &s;troke, is this.</P>
<P><HI>Let the two &s;triking bodies be fir&s;t con|&s;idered as non-ela&s;tic, and let the force of each body after the &s;troke be found, as al&s;o the force communicated from the one to the other. Then as they are ela&s;tic, let this force be &s;ubducted from that of the &s;triking body after the &s;troke, and added to
<PB N="194" REF="211">
that of the body which received the &s;troke, and the re&s;idue will be the force of the &s;triking body, and the &s;um the force of the other body after &s;eparation.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is demon&s;trable; for with whatever force the bodies &s;truck each other, by virtue of their weights and &s;wiftne&s;s, they will recede as much by virtue of their ela&s;ticity, and throw one another contrary ways, each with a quan|tity of force equal to that which the &s;trik|ing body communicates to the other; for which rea&s;on, if that force be &s;ubducted from the force remaining in the &s;triking body after the &s;troke, as being contrary thereto, and added to the force of the other body after the &s;troke, as con&s;piring therewith, the re&s;idue and &s;um will give the forces of the bodies after &s;epa|ration.</P>
<P>THESE general expre&s;&s;ions will be better under&s;tood, by making particular applications. If two equal bodies meet
<PB N="195" REF="212">
one another with equal forces, they will be reflected back with the &s;ame forces and the &s;ame velocities wherewith they approached. For if non-ela&s;tic, they would upon the &s;troke de&s;troy each other's force; but by the rule each of them mu&s;t, on account of ela&s;ticity, re|ceive as much as they gave; and the forces which are thus received by the bo|dies being equal, mu&s;t carry the bodies backward with the &s;ame equal force wherewith they approached.</P>
<P>IF a body, perfectly ela&s;tic, &s;trikes another of equal magnitude at re&s;t, the &s;triking body will communicate all its force to the other, and remain at re&s;t it&s;elf. For if they were non-ela&s;tic, the &s;triking body would upon the &s;troke communicate half its force, (as may be ea&s;ily calculated;) and by the rule now laid down, a quantity of force, equal to that communicated, mu&s;t be &s;ubducted from the &s;triking body, and added to the motion of the body which receives the &s;troke, by which means
<PB N="196" REF="213">
the &s;triking body will have no force left; but the other will have a quantity of force equal to what the &s;triking body had before the &s;hock.</P>
<P>IF two ela&s;tic balls be unequal; for in&s;tance, if one be double the other, and if the greater have nine degrees of velocity and the le&s;&s;er be at re&s;t, they will both move forward after the &s;troke; the &s;triking body with one third of the force which it had before the &s;troke, and the other with two thirds; and the velocity of the &s;triking body will be three, and of the other twelve. For &s;ince the &s;triking body is to the quie&s;cent as two to one, if non-ela&s;tic, it would communicate one third of its force; and being ela&s;tic, a quantity of force equal to what is communicated, mu&s;t be taken from the force remaining in the &s;triking body, and added to the force of the other; con&s;equently the &s;triking body will retain one third only of its force, the other two thirds being communicated
<PB N="197" REF="214">
to the body which receives the &s;troke; wherefore, &s;ince the &s;triking body weighs double, or is two, and its velocity nine, its force mu&s;t be eighteen, one third of which, to wit, &s;ix, it will retain after the reflection, and the other two thirds, to wit, twelve, will be the motion of the other body; and the&s;e motions being divided by the bodies, will give three and twelve for the quotients; which quotients are as the velocities of the bodies after reflection.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if a &s;mall ela&s;tic ball &s;trikes a larger at re&s;t, let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;maller ball to have nine degrees of velocity, and weigh one pound, the larger, which is at re&s;t, to weigh two pound. The force of the &s;maller will be nine, and it would, if non-ela&s;tic, com|municate two thirds of this force upon the &s;troke to the greater, and only one third remain in it which is the &s;triking ball. Now on account of the ela&s;ticity,
<PB N="198" REF="215">
we mu&s;t &s;ubduct from this remainder, as much force as was communicated, namely, two thirds; but upon &s;ubduct|ing two thirds from one third, there will remain one third negative, which &s;hews that the &s;triking ball will be reflected with one third of the force it had at the time of the &s;troke, &s;o as to a&s;cend backward with a velocity of three. But the greater ball, to which two thirds of the &s;triking ball's motion was communicated by the &s;troke, will likewi&s;e, on account of the ela&s;ticity, receive two thirds more, &s;o as to be carried forward with a force equal to what the &s;triking ball had at the time of the &s;troke, and one third more; that is to &s;ay, with a motion which is as twelve, which being divided by two, the weight of the ball, gives &s;ix for the velocity with which the ball will recoil.</P>
<P>IF two equal ela&s;tic bodies move in the &s;ame direction, and in &s;uch a manner as that one may overtake and &s;trike the other, upon the &s;troke, they will ex|change
<PB N="199" REF="216">
their quantities of force with each other. For in&s;tance, if the force of the &s;ub&s;equent body before the &s;troke be double the force of the preceding body, then will the preceding body after the &s;troke, have double the force of the &s;ub|&s;equent body after the &s;troke; and the preceding body after the &s;troke, will move with the &s;ame velocity the &s;ub&s;e|quent body moved before the &s;troke; and the &s;ub&s;equent body will, after the &s;troke, be carried with the velocity of the preceding body before the &s;troke: &s;o that upon the &s;troke the bodies will exchange their forces; but as the weights of the bodies are the &s;ame, we may in other words &s;ay, they will exchange their velocities. For let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;um of the forces to be three, and as the bodies are equal, the force of each after the &s;troke, if they were non-ela&s;tic, would be one and an half, and the force communi|cated would be one and an half; and &s;o likewi&s;e will the force ari&s;ing from ela&s;ti|city, which being deducted from the
<PB N="200" REF="217">
force which remains in the &s;triking body after the &s;troke, and added to that of the preceding body, leaves the force of the former as one, and the latter as two, &s;o that after the &s;troke the forces will be exchanged.</P>
<P>IF the bodies be unequal, and move the &s;ame way, their forces and velocities after the &s;troke, may in like manner be di&s;covered by the help of the rule. For in&s;tance, if the &s;ub&s;equent be two pound, and have twelve degrees of force, and the preceding be one pound, and have three degrees of force; the force of the &s;ub&s;equent body after the &s;troke will be eight, and that of the preceding body &s;even; and the velocity of the former will be as four, and that of the latter as &s;even. For the &s;um of the two forces before the &s;troke being fifteen, and the bodies being as one and two, the force of the le&s;&s;er body after the &s;troke, if non-ela&s;tic, would be five, and that of the greater ten. But the force of the le&s;&s;er
<PB N="201" REF="218">
body, before the &s;troke, was three, con|&s;equently the communicated motion is two. Now adding &s;o much, on account of ela&s;ticity, to the motion of the le&s;&s;er body, and &s;ubducting as much from that of the greater body, we &s;hall have eight for the motion of the greater, which being divided by two, the quantity of matter in the greater, gives four for its velocity; and we &s;hall have &s;even for the motion of the le&s;&s;er body, which, be|cau&s;e the weight in the le&s;&s;er is one, will likewi&s;e expre&s;s the velocity.</P>
<P>IF two bodies meet each other with unequal forces, if their weights be equal, they will both be reflected, and each of them will recede with the force and velocity wherewith the other approached; that is, they will exchange their forces and velocities. For let us &s;uppo&s;e the motions of the two bodies to be as &s;ix and three; if they were non-ela&s;tic, the body which has the &s;malle&s;t quantity of force, would upon the &s;troke be turned
<PB N="202" REF="219">
back, and the two bodies would be car|ried with the difference of their forces divided equally between them; that is, the force of each would be as one and an half, and the force communicated would be as four and an half. But a quan|tity of force, equal to what is communi|cated, mu&s;t be &s;ubducted from the force remaining in the &s;triking or greater body, and added to the force of the other; that is, four and an half mu&s;t be &s;ubducted from one and an half, and like|wi&s;e added thereto, whereby there will be three negative for the force of the &s;triking or greater body; which &s;hews that it will be carried back with a force as three; and there will be &s;ix po&s;itive for the force of the other body, which &s;hews that it will be carried with a force which is as &s;ix, in the direction of the &s;triking body before the &s;troke, that is, it will be reflected; &s;o that each of them will be carried back with the motion wherewith the other approached.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="220">IF the balls be unequal and meet each other with unequal forces, their forces after the &s;troke may in like man|ner be determined by the rule. For in&s;tance, if two bodies, one weighing two pound, and with &s;ix degrees of velocity, the other weighing one pound with three degrees of velocity, and the&s;e &s;trike each other in oppo&s;ite directions; in this ca&s;e, the greater ball will upon the &s;troke lo&s;e all its force, and the &s;maller will be reflected with the dif|ference of their forces. For &s;uppo&s;ing them non-ela&s;tic, the force in the larger, which is two, multiplied by &s;ix, makes twelve; the force of the le&s;&s;er, which is one, multiplied by three, makes three. The difference therefore of their motions is nine, and this being divided between the bodies, in proportion to their quan|tities of matter, gives &s;ix for the motion of the larger, and three for that of the &s;maller; now by rea&s;on of their ela&s;ticity, a force equal to what is communicated by the &s;triking or larger body to the other,
<PB N="204" REF="221">
which in this ca&s;e is &s;ix, mu&s;t be taken from the force of the greater body and added to that of the &s;maller, which two forces being &s;ix and three, the remain|der, after &s;ubduction, which expre&s;&s;es the force of the greater body, will be nothing, and the &s;um ari&s;ing from the addition, which expre&s;&s;es the motion of the &s;maller ball, will be nine.</P>
<P>ALL that has been a&s;&s;erted here from theory, will, upon experiment, be found to an&s;wer pretty nearly. The bodies made u&s;e of in &s;uch admea&s;ure|ments are ivory balls, which di&s;cover the greate&s;t ela&s;ticity. They are hung upon &s;trings like pendulums, and then let fall from determined heights, which heights are adju&s;ted by a &s;cale. The height from which the body falls repre|&s;ents its velocity, the weight and height together repre&s;ents the body's force.</P>

the &s;hock of &s;everal. For &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal hung up contiguous to each other, (fig. 28.) and the ball 1, be let fall by a &s;tring upon ball 2, the &s;troke will be immediately and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly communicated through the whole range of balls, and ball 8 will fly off to <HI>a,</HI> which is an height equal to that from whence ball 1 fell. If in&s;tead of one ball being let fall, we &s;hould drop two in the &s;ame manner, then ball 7 and 8 would both fly off to the &s;ame heights from whence ball 1 and 2 were let fall. In the &s;ame manner, if we let three fall, three would fly off on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and thus of any number what&s;oever. The rea&s;on of all this is &s;ufficiently apparent; for if we only recollect that each ball, when &s;truck, alters its figure into an ellip&s;oide, and by this means &s;trikes again&s;t that next to it, this other communicates the &s;ame to the next, that again to its contiguous ball, and &s;o on through the whole range, till the la&s;t ball meeting with none other to re&s;i&s;t it, flies off with the motion of the

<P>THE force will be thus communicated if the balls are equal; but if the &s;triking ball be le&s;s than the balls at re&s;t, and if the&s;e increa&s;e in weight one above the other in proper order, the force in the la&s;t ball that flies off, will be con&s;ider|ably greater than that of the ball which fir&s;t made the &s;troke; and this force may be increa&s;ed to any degree what&s;oever. For let us &s;uppo&s;e but two balls only, the &s;maller ball mu&s;t upon the &s;troke, if it were non-ela&s;tic, communicate more than half its force to the greater ball, and there mu&s;t likewi&s;e be, on account of ela&s;ticity, as much more &s;ubducted from the &s;maller ball, and added to the larger; wherefore, &s;ince two equal quantities of force, each of which exceeds half the &s;maller ball's force, are to be &s;ubducted from the &s;maller ball, and given to the larger, it is plain that the &s;maller mu&s;t lo&s;e all its motion and &s;omething more, that
<PB N="207" REF="225">
is, it mu&s;t recoil back, and the greater ball mu&s;t go forward with more force than was in the &s;maller at the time of the &s;troke, that is, its force will be augmented. Now therefore, if a force be communi|cated from a &s;maller ela&s;tic body to a larger, by means of &s;everal intermediate bodies each larger than the other, the motion will be augmented in each of them, and the motion of the la&s;t will greatly exceed that of the fir&s;t; and this force will be conveyed with lea&s;t diminu|tion, if the weights of the bodies ri&s;e above each other &s;o that the la&s;t be as much greater than the former, as that is exceeded by the foregoing. As an in&s;tance how prodigiou&s;ly force may be augmented by being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively com|municated through a range of bodies, increa&s;ing in this progre&s;&s;ion: If twenty ela&s;tic bodies be placed one after another, each &s;ucceeding body being twenty times greater than that next it, and if a force be impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;malle&s;t body, the la&s;t body will fly off with a
<PB N="208" REF="226">
force two hundred thou&s;and times greater than that with which the &s;malle&s;t body fir&s;t &s;truck the range. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a cannon ball, &s;hot from its culverin, to be ela&s;tic, and &s;triking with all its force a range of balls, in|crea&s;ing in the proportion above men|tioned; what an amazing effect would it not have. But &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;s would quickly de&s;troy it&s;elf; the ball, from the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to its pa&s;&s;age, would fly into a thou&s;and pieces; for no &s;troke that we have an idea of, could equal that with which the air, however yield|ing it may appear to us, would act upon a body thus violently carried again&s;t it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of Mechanic Powers.</HEAD>
<P>THE power which man thus finds that one body has of communi|cating its motion to another, has taught him to make u&s;e of &s;ome bodies to re|move others which he finds nece&s;&s;ary or proper to be removed. A weight greater than what his natural &s;trength could manage, without &s;ome &s;uch contriv|ance, could never be lifted from the earth; he finds him&s;elf therefore obliged to call in the force of inanimate nature, in making &s;uch alterations as his plea|&s;ures or nece&s;&s;ities may require. By means of levers he lifts weights much greater than his &s;trength could over|come; with the axle and wheel he can lift them to greater heights; with the pulley to greater &s;till; the &s;crew, if it could move without friction, would give him greater force than any of the re&s;t; but a machine compo&s;ed of all the&s;e united, would increa&s;e his &s;trength to a degree

&s;urpa&s;&s;ing credit. Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> in a work of his called <HI>Mechanic Magic,</HI> a&s;&s;erts that he could pull up an oak by the roots with a &s;ingle hor&s;e hair; and &s;o indeed he could, if the parts of the machine did not rub again&s;t each other, and thus retard the motion. However, even as it is, we &s;ee &s;uch weights re|moved and rai&s;ed to con&s;iderable heights, as would, to an unexperienced &s;avage, appear the work of enchantment. Nor were the ancients without a great knowledge in this art, of increa&s;ing human &s;trength by machinery. The &s;tones which we &s;ee laid upon the tops of the pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> each of which is as big as a &s;mall hou&s;e, create even the wonder of a modern machini&s;t, and teach him to reverence the &s;uperior arts of antiquity.</P>
<P>WE come now therefore to explain the manner in which human &s;trength is thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the in&s;truments made u&s;e of for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e are called
<PB N="211" REF="229">
mechanic powers, and are &s;aid to be &s;ix in number; namely, the <HI>lever,</HI> the <HI>axle and wheel,</HI> the <HI>pulley,</HI> the <HI>&s;crew,</HI> the <HI>wedge,</HI> and the <HI>inclined plane.</HI> Such is the number u&s;ually reckoned; &s;ome however mention the balance among the mechanic powers, and omit the inclined plane; a <HI>Frenchman</HI> among the moderns adds another mechanic power, which he calls <HI>La Machine Funiculaire.</HI> It mat|ters little what number of mechanic powers we make, it is &s;ufficient if we de&s;cribe them all. Were whatever in|&s;trument encrea&s;ed human force in moving or rai&s;ing bodies by machinery, to be reckoned among the number of mechanic powers, we might add &s;till another, namely, &s;uch a machine as would convey a range of ela&s;tic bodies increa&s;ing in the progre&s;&s;ion, which has been explained in the former chapter; this and others &s;till might be added, differing in principles from tho&s;e we are &s;hortly to explain. But no matter for the names, let us de&s;cribe the things.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="230">THE balance, as we &s;aid, is reckoned by &s;ome among the mechanic powers; and though it does not tend to increa&s;e human force, yet it will be the propere&s;t to be de&s;cribed fir&s;t, as it will &s;erve to explain the re&s;t, which are &s;omewhat upon &s;imilar principles. Suppo&s;e I take any thing that is next my hand, a walk|ing cane for in&s;tance, and attempt to balance it acro&s;s my finger; I &s;hall at la&s;t find &s;ome one particular part in it which being &s;upported, neither of the ends will preponderate. The very part of it that re&s;ts upon my finger is the center of its weight, which being &s;up|ported, the whole cane is &s;upported. It is called by mechani&s;t the <HI>center of gra|vity.</HI> If I &s;hould remove my finger from this center of gravity, which I have thus found out, towards either of the extre|mities of the cane, though but of the &s;malle&s;t di&s;tance; that &s;ide would &s;ink towards the earth which had the center of gravity in it. Thus no body at free|dom will be &s;upported, unle&s;s the
<PB N="213" REF="231">
greate&s;t part of its weight be &s;upported, and whatever &s;upports that, mu&s;t &s;up|port the center of gravity al&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT though I have thus balanced the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ne with &s;ome &s;mall difficulty, yet all bodies what&s;oever that are at re&s;t, are ba|lanced in the &s;ame manner; their centers of gravity are &s;upported upon &s;ome ba&s;e or prop, which keeps them firm, and the wider the ba&s;e is on which the body is &s;upported, the more difficulty will that body be overturned. For in order to this, I mu&s;t fir&s;t pu&s;h the center of gravity, or in other words, the greate&s;t half of the body's weight, from off the ba&s;e or prop, before the body can become top heavy; and it is plain, that it will be harder to lift the half of the body's weight over a large ba&s;e than a &s;mall one. If a ca&s;k be placed upon one of its ends, for in&s;tance, it may require great &s;trength to overturn it, becau&s;e I mu&s;t pu&s;h the center of gravity beyond its ba&s;e, which is broad; but if the ca&s;k lies
<PB N="214" REF="232">
on one &s;ide, I can roll it over with ea&s;e, becau&s;e the narrow ba&s;e touches the ground but almo&s;t in a point, and therefore the centre of gravity may ea&s;ily be pu&s;hed beyond it. For this rea&s;on it is that a cylinder, or body &s;haped like a rolling &s;tone, makes many turns as it de&s;cends down an inclined plane, for the center of its gravity falls continually beyond the narrowne&s;s of the ba&s;e; while on the contrary, if the &s;ame body were made &s;quare, and con|&s;equently with a large ba&s;e, it would either not de&s;cend at all, or it would &s;lide down without being once over|turned in the way.</P>
<P>MAN him&s;elf may be con&s;idered as a body thus balanced: if his center of gravity re&s;ts upon his feet he can &s;tand; but if it is thrown beyond this &s;upport, he mu&s;t inevitably fall. A man with a burthen at his back mu&s;t lean forward, for &s;hould he attempt to retain his u&s;ual rectitude of figure, his center of
<PB N="215" REF="233">
gravity would be altered, and he mu&s;t con&s;equently fall backward. With a burthen on his brea&s;t, he in the &s;ame manner counter-balances the weight by altering his figure in the oppo&s;ite po&s;i|tion. Almo&s;t in every in&s;tance of his motions he is obliged to make u&s;e of the&s;e balancing arts to keep him&s;elf up|right; and it is u&s;ually the &s;tudy of a fine painter to known how far the human figure may be bent, without its ab&s;olutely lo&s;ing the center of its gravity. <HI>Da Vinci,</HI> one of the fir&s;t painters after the revival of the art, has laid down rules upon this &s;ubject; &s;ucceeding painters have improved upon his plan: <HI>Dom|ponius Gaurie,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> &s;culptor, who wrote a Latin treati&s;e upon this &s;ubject, thus admirably expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: <HI>Omne corpus, ni&s;i extrema &s;e&s;e undique conti|neant, librenturque ad centrum, collabatur ruatque, nece&s;&s;e e&s;t.</HI> "Every body mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall, unle&s;s it unites together in the center of all its extremes, and the&s;e are balanced again&s;t each other." What|ever
<PB N="216" REF="234">
weight, &s;aith <HI>Watelet,</HI> the human figure is repre&s;ented as lifting, we are by no means to e&s;timate it by its &s;ize, and &s;o, to make it appear more ponderous, to draw it more large; no, we are to throw the whole effect of its weight into the figure that is &s;uppo&s;ed to lift it, and di&s;tort the animal form as much from the natural po&s;ition, as the weight is &s;uppo&s;ed to be heavy.</P>
<P>IN general the human body, and every other what&s;oever, will &s;tand mo&s;t firmly where the ba&s;e is broade&s;t, and bears every part of the weight mo&s;t equally; or in other words, where the center of gravity lies mo&s;t exactly over the middle of the ba&s;e. For this rea&s;on, a man when he wre&s;tles, generally widens his legs in order to widen his ba&s;e, and thus prevent his antagoni&s;t's &s;trength from overturning the center of his gravity.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee man and all other bodies balanced upon their centers; the bodies
<PB N="217" REF="235">
which have the large&s;t ba&s;es, and bear the incumbent weight mo&s;t equally, are mo&s;t firmly fixed; on the contrary, tho&s;e which have the &s;malle&s;t ba&s;es, or who&s;e bodies are &s;upported but upon a point, are lea&s;t firmly placed, and may be overturned with the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible alteration. Now &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould place a wooden beam, with its center of gravity re&s;ting upon the point of an upright needle, this would not fall; for as the center of gravity is &s;upported, &s;o likewi&s;e would the whole of the beam be. Again, &s;uppo&s;e the beam, thus wavering at every touch but &s;till balanced upon the point, to be twice as long on one &s;ide as on the other; that is, &s;uppo&s;e it one yard long on one &s;ide of the &s;upporting point, (fig. 29.) and two yards long on the other. To it, thus balanced as it is, let us hang equal weights at either end, a pound at one end, and a pound at the other. The balance will now entirely be de&s;troyed; the weight at the longer end, which is two yards, will in&s;tantly
<PB N="218" REF="236">
preponderate, and appear to be much heavier than the other. Why? The u&s;ual &s;olution is this. Suppo&s;e the weight at the longer end B, de&s;cends to C, it will de&s;cribe a &s;pace equal to B C, while the weight at the &s;horte&s;t end A, will at the &s;ame time ri&s;e only to D, and de&s;cribe a &s;horter &s;pace equal to A D. The weight B therefore, which de&s;cribes the large&s;t &s;pace, will have the greate&s;t velocity. But the force of all bodies is compo&s;ed of the velocity and weight; and as B hath as much weight as A, and a much greater velocity, it will have therefore a greater force, and con&s;equently out-ba|lance its antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON this ea&s;y principle, continue they, the whole of mechanics depends; &s;o that if two bodies are &s;u&s;pended at each end of a beam, or any machine what&s;oever, if the one be as much &s;uperior in its velocity, as the other ex|ceeds it in weight, the bodies will balance each other; if the velocity be greater in
<PB N="219" REF="237">
proportion, that &s;ide will &s;ink; on the other hand, if the weight be greater in proportion, that will preponderate. As for example: If the &s;ide or arm A of the beam be one yard to the prop F, while the &s;ide or arm B is two yards; as B has thus twice the velocity of A, I mu&s;t make A twice the weight to counterpoi&s;e B. If B be one pound, I mu&s;t make A two pounds, to keep the balance equal. So that univer&s;ally to make a lighter body out-weigh an heavy one, it is but to make up the defects of its weight by increa&s;ing its velocity. Thus one pound, if it has twice as much velocity, or in other words, be twice as di&s;tant from the prop, it will balance a body that is twice as heavy as it&s;elf. A weight of one pound, if it be twelve degrees di&s;tant from the prop, will balance a weight of twelve pounds that is but one degree di&s;tant.</P>
<P>A COMMON pair of &s;cales is a beam &s;u&s;pended upon a point or axle, and its
<PB N="220" REF="238">
arms are equally long, and equally heavy; &s;o that the velocity on both &s;ides is the &s;ame, and al&s;o the weight is the &s;ame; and con&s;equently all bodies of equal weights put into either &s;cale, will balance each other. But this, as I &s;aid before, will not happen, if one arm of the in&s;trument were longer than the other; for then that at the longe&s;t end having greater velocity will prepon|derate.</P>
<P>THE &s;teelyard is an in&s;trument of this kind, contrived for weighing bodies by a &s;ingle weight, who&s;e velocity or di&s;|tance from the prop, we increa&s;e in pro|portion to the weight to be known. For if a &s;cale hangs at A, the extremity of the &s;horter arm, and is of &s;uch a weight as will exactly counterpoi&s;e the longer arm C; if this arm be divided into as many parts as it will contain, each equal to A B, the &s;ingle weight P, which we may &s;uppo&s;e to be one pound, will &s;erve for weighing any thing as heavy as it&s;elf,
<PB N="221" REF="239">
or as many times heavier than it&s;elf, as there are divi&s;ions in the arm B C. Thus we &s;ee that one pound, at the di&s;tance of twelve, balances again&s;t twelve pound at the di&s;tance of one.</P>
<P>SUCH is the manner in which me|chani&s;ts have u&s;ually explained this &s;ub|ject; and it mu&s;t be owned that in practice it an&s;wers pretty exactly. Not|with&s;tanding this, <HI>Newton,</HI> &s;agacious in all things, was &s;en&s;ible that the theory &s;hewn here, was ob&s;cure and un&s;up|ported; he therefore gave a theory much more difficult, though much more &s;atisfac|tory. Mr. <HI>Varignon</HI> and Mr. <HI>D'Alembert</HI> are equally di&s;plea&s;ed with the former the|ory. <HI>We have not,</HI> &s;ays the latter, <HI>a &s;ingle work on mechanics, in which the theory is proved with the exactitude it requires.</HI> In fact, to e&s;tabli&s;h the former theory, we are obliged to &s;uppo&s;e two bodies equally at re&s;t to have &s;uperior velocity one above the other; though, when we are a&s;ked what velocity means, it only
<PB N="222" REF="240">
&s;ignifies their going through more &s;pace in the &s;ame time. Now is it not evident that at the beginning of the time, neither has gone through any &s;pace at all, and therefore their velocities mu&s;t be equal. So that &s;uperior velocity cannot be brought to prove why one body fir&s;t begins to preponderate again&s;t its antagoni&s;t of equal weight, yet this is what we de&s;ire to know. The theory therefore mu&s;t be built upon another foundation; perhaps it may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the method following.</P>
<P>WHAT I de&s;ire to know is, why a beam, with one arm longer than the other, and which being placed upon a point or prop, is exactly balanced; why, I &s;ay, when thus balanced, if I hang equal weights at either end, the beam &s;hall no longer continue in balance, but the longer arm &s;hall preponderate? To explain why this is &s;o, it mu&s;t again be repeated, what was &s;aid of the center of gravity, that all bodies &s;tood mo&s;t firm when the
<PB N="223" REF="241">
ba&s;e was large&s;t, and the center of gravity was placed mo&s;t exactly over the middle of the ba&s;e. The nearer the edge of the ba&s;e the center of gravity fell, as was &s;aid then, the readier would the body be to fall. If the center of gravity fell ju&s;t without the ba&s;e, the body would effectually tumble, though only with &s;o much velocity, as the re&s;i&s;tance of the ba&s;e, which tends to keep it upright, is exceeded by the power that cau&s;es it to de&s;cend. Thus the body may be &s;up|po&s;ed as acted upon by two contrary forces, and the velocity mu&s;t be in pro|portion to the exce&s;s of one force above the other; but &s;mall, becau&s;e the differ|ence between the gravity and the re&s;i&s;t|ance is &s;uppo&s;ed to be ju&s;t begun. Now if the center of gravity fell &s;till farther beyond the ba&s;e, the re&s;i&s;tance of the ba&s;e to the body's de&s;cent would be &s;till le&s;s; for as we &s;aid, the ba&s;e gives mo&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance when the center of gravity is in the middle, and therefore the farther the center of gravity is removed from
<PB N="224" REF="242">
its middle, the le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance will it give; and therefore the body will be more acted upon by the power which cau&s;es it to de&s;cend, and it will tumble with greater velocity. So that in general we may conclude, the farther the center of gravity falls beyond the &s;upporting ba&s;e, the &s;wifter will be its de&s;cent.</P>
<P>ALL this being premi&s;ed, if I now inquire why a &s;maller weight C, pre|ponderates in the balance, though op|po&s;ed by a great one A; I an&s;wer, be|cau&s;e the center of gravity in the beam, falls to a greater di&s;tance on the pre|ponderating &s;ide C, than A. For let us &s;uppo&s;e the beam F, without its weights, but balanced upon its ba&s;e, which is but a point. Now if I &s;hould hang a pound at A, this would throw the center of gravity, which was before at F, nearer to A, and far beyond the ba&s;e, &s;o that A would preponderate. In order to oppo&s;e this therefore, I mu&s;t hang an equal weight of a pound at an
<PB N="225" REF="243">
equal di&s;tance from the ba&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide at E, which will throw the center of gravity as much beyond the ba&s;e that way, &s;o that the center in this ca&s;e, actuated by two equal forces, will &s;till remain &s;u&s;pended over the middle of its point or ba&s;e F. But again, if we place this equal weight at more than an equal di&s;tance, &s;till farther to B, it is evident that it will overcome its antagoni&s;t, and remove the center of gravity at a greater di&s;tance from its ba&s;e, and that therefore the body mu&s;t fall that way; and con&s;equently, as we &s;aid above, with the greater velocity. We may therefore conclude univer&s;ally, that if two equal bodies be balanced upon a point, and each equally di&s;tant from it, if one of them be removed at a &s;till greater di&s;tance, it will endeavour to de&s;cend with greater velocity, the farther its center of gravity falls beyond the ba&s;e or point on which it re&s;ts. In other words, the ba&s;e or point is thus rendered more di&s;tant, and con&s;equently
<PB N="226" REF="244">
le&s;s capable of contributing to the body's &s;upport.</P>
<P>FROM all that has been here &s;aid, we at length perceive the weakne&s;s of the former theory, and we now &s;ee that a &s;mall weight out-balances a greater, not becau&s;e it has a greater velocity, but becau&s;e the prop, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upports both, &s;u&s;tains a greater part of the large weight that is near, than of the &s;mall weight that is farther off. That the body placed at the longer end, when put into motion, hath more velocity, is mo&s;t certain; but this velocity was nothing when the bodies were in equilibrium, and therefore could never de&s;troy that equilibrium: velocity is the con&s;equence of motion, not the cau&s;e. If it be &s;aid, that the body had a poten|tial, or, as <HI>Leibnitz</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, a virtual velocity, though not yet exerted; this is only &s;aying in a dark and unintelli|gible manner, what we have endeavoured to throw into greater &s;un-&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="245">THIS theory may, with great ea&s;e, be applied to the &s;olution of &s;everal more complex propo&s;itions. As for in&s;tance, if a man, &s;tanding in one &s;cale of a large pair of &s;cales, and balanced by weights in the oppo&s;ite, &s;hould extend his arm, and pre&s;s the beam upward with his hand, towards the middle, this pre&s;&s;ure would take effect, although his feet &s;eem to pre&s;s downward as much as his hand upward; this pre&s;&s;ure upward, I &s;ay, would rai&s;e the &s;cale in which he &s;tands. For (to di&s;patch it in a few words) by extending his arm nearer the prop, he brings the general centre of gravity more within the ba&s;e. It is partly owing to this, and partly to the ela&s;ticity of the mu&s;cles employed in the pre&s;&s;ure above, while the mu&s;cles below have le&s;s employment, and con&s;equently le&s;s ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>THIS theory will &s;erve to explain the proportions that mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in a balance, where one or both the arms
<PB N="228" REF="246">
are crooked. All the mechanic powers may be reduced to the balance, this theory may therefore, by &s;ome attention in the &s;tudents, be applied to them; it is enough here to explain the principle; &s;uch as are fonder of calculations than I am, may make the application.</P>
<P>THE mechanic power mo&s;t allied to the balance, and in fact, &s;carce differing from it, is the <HI>Lever.</HI> A lever is a bar of iron or wood, one part of which being &s;upported by a prop, all other parts turn upon that prop as their center of motion. This in&s;trument is of two kinds. Fir&s;t, the common &s;ort, where the weight we de&s;ire to rai&s;e, re&s;ts at at one end of it, our &s;trength is ap|plied at the other end, and the prop is between both. When I &s;tir up my fire with the poker, I make u&s;e of this lever; the poker is the lever, it re&s;ts upon one of the bars of the grate as a prop, the incumbent fire is the weight to be overcome, and the other
<PB N="229" REF="247">
end I hold in my hand, which is the &s;trength or power. In this, as in all the re&s;t, we have only to increa&s;e the di&s;tance between the &s;trength and prop, to give the man that works the in&s;tru|ment greater power: the rea&s;on has been already explained at large.</P>
<P>THE lever of the &s;econd kind, has the prop at one end, the &s;trength is applied to the other, and the weight to be rai&s;ed re&s;ts between them. Thus in rai&s;ing the water plug in the &s;treets, the workman puts his iron lever through the hole of the plug till he reaches the ground on the other &s;ide, and making that his prop, lifts the plug with his &s;trength at the other end of the lever. In this lever al&s;o, the greater the di&s;tance of the prop from the &s;trength, the greater is the workman's power.</P>
<P>THESE in&s;truments, as we &s;ee, a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;trength; but &s;ometimes a workman is obliged to act at a di&s;advantage, in
<PB N="230" REF="248">
rai&s;ing either a piece of timber or a ladder upon one end. We cannot, with grammatical propriety, call this a <HI>lever,</HI> &s;ince &s;uch a piece of timber in fact no way contributes to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> the weight. In this ca&s;e, the man, who is the &s;trength or power, is in the middle, the part of the beam already rai&s;ed is the weight, the part yet at the ground is the prop, on which the beam turns or re&s;ts. Here the man's &s;trength will be dimini&s;hed, in proportion to the weight it &s;u&s;tains. The weight will be greater the farther it is from the prop, therefore the man will bear the greater weight the nearer he is to the prop.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd mechanic power is the axle in the wheel, in which the &s;trength is applied to the circumference of the wheel, and the weight to be rai&s;ed is fa&s;tened to one end of a rope, who&s;e other end winds round an axle, that turns with the wheel. (Fig. 30.) This in&s;trument is more commonly u&s;ed with
<PB N="231" REF="249">
an handle: thus, to wind up a jack I turn the handle, which coils the cord round the axle in the middle: to wind a bucket from a well, I do the &s;ame thing; to wind up my watch, the &s;ame: the handle in all the&s;e is in the place of a wheel, and the farther this handle is from the center, the axle, on which the whole weight is &s;u&s;tained, the more powerful will it be. Or if it be a wheel, the more its diameter exceeds the diameter of the axle, the greater will be its power. Thus, if the wheel be eight times as wide as the axle is thick, it will have eight times the power; and a man, who by his natural &s;trength, could only lift an hundred weight, by this machine will be enabled to lift eight hundred.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance with regard to this machine I mu&s;t not omit: workmen uni|ver&s;ally affirm, that in rai&s;ing weights to con&s;iderable heights, (to an hou&s;e-top, for in&s;tance) with an axle and wheel, they find the weight mo&s;t heavy when
<PB N="232" REF="250">
they fir&s;t begin to wind, and that it grows lighter and lighter as it approaches the axle. The rea&s;on of this &s;eems to be, that the weight appended at the cord, when longe&s;t, is apt to &s;wing; and if we re&s;olve the whole machine into a common lever, we &s;hall find that the weight to be rai&s;ed in this ca&s;e, will, by &s;winging, either fall at a great di&s;tance from the prop, or it will fall nearer the prop, or it will fall between the prop and the power. In the fir&s;t and la&s;t ca&s;e, its &s;eeming weight will be augmented, in the middle ca&s;e it will be le&s;&s;ened. So that when the weight &s;wings, there are two to one that the weight will appear augmented to the labourer; and the greater the &s;wing, the greater will this augmentation be.</P>
<P>THE third mechanic power is the <HI>pulley,</HI> which is a &s;mall wheel that turns about its axis, and which hath a drawing rope pa&s;&s;ing upon it. In every clock, the two weights de&s;cend upon two little

bra&s;s pullies, that fall, and are wound up with them. In our kitchen jacks, the weights de&s;cend upon pullies in the &s;ame manner. The pulley is either fixed or moveable, that is, it is either fa&s;tened to &s;ome large immoveable piece of timber; thus, A A fa&s;tened to the beam b, (fig. 31.) or it moves with the weight to be rai&s;ed, thus; if I draw the cord E, that pa&s;&s;es over the fixed pulley C, I &s;hall rai&s;e the weight W, and the moveable pulley D, will ri&s;e as the weight ri&s;es.</P>
<P>A FIXED pulley that only turns on its axis and ri&s;es not with the weight, can only &s;erve to change the direction of the moving power, which is in all ca&s;es exceedingly convenient. For in&s;tance, if the weight W, is to be rai&s;ed to A, and the man cannot readily get to it, or exert his &s;trength when he gets there, he has then only to throw the cord B round the pulley fixed at A; and &s;tand|ing upon the ground, and exerting his &s;trength at D, he can move the weight
<PB N="234" REF="253">
W, to the height A intended. But though this be convenient, yet it gives him no additional power, for it is only as the beam of a balance, who&s;e arms are of equal length and weight. Thus, if the equal weights W and P, hang by the cord B B upon the pulley A, they will counterpoi&s;e each other, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as if the cord was &s;treight|ened into an inflexible iron bar, and the two weights left to balance each other with the pulley for a prop.</P>
<P>BUT in the moveable pulley it is otherwi&s;e; for if a weight W hang at the lower end of the moveable pulley D, and the cord G F go under the pulley, and is fixed at the top of the hook H on one &s;ide, and nailed to the block C on the other; it is evident that H and C be|tween them &s;upport the whole weight W; H &s;upports one half, and C the other half. Now &s;uppo&s;e I take the &s;upport of one of their halves upon my&s;elf, but merely change the direction of my power, and in&s;tead of holding up the
<PB N="235" REF="254">
cord at C, throw it over the immoveable pulley fixed there, and exert my &s;trength below at P; it will be evident that I &s;upport one half of the weight W, and the hook H &s;upports the other. If therefore I draw the cord at P, the weight W will continue to ri&s;e, but wherever it ri&s;es, I continue to &s;upport but half its weight, while H &s;upports the other. Thus, one &s;ingle moveable pulley dimini&s;hes one half of the weight to be rai&s;ed; if we &s;hould add another, it would dimini&s;h the half of that which remained, and &s;o on. For in&s;tance, if a weight of eight hundred pounds is to be rai&s;ed, I u&s;e one moveable pulley, and that will le&s;&s;en the weight one half, to four hundred; I add another moveable pulley, and that will le&s;&s;en the remaining four by one half, which is two hundred; if I &s;till add a third, that will le&s;&s;en the remaining two by one half, which is one; &s;o that if I u&s;e three moveable pullies in rai&s;ing eight hundred weight, I &s;hall be able to rai&s;e it with as much ea&s;e, as one hundred without them.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="255">AS a &s;y&s;tem of pullies have no great weight, and lie in a &s;mall compa&s;s, they are ea&s;ily carried, and can be u&s;ed in many ca&s;es where more cumbrous engines cannot. They have much friction however, becau&s;e the diameter of their axis bears a very con&s;iderable pro|portion to their own diameter, becau&s;e they are apt to rub again&s;t each other, or again&s;t the &s;ides of the block, and be|cau&s;e the rope that goes round them is never perfectly pliant.</P>
<P>THE next mechanic power u&s;ually mentioned is the <HI>wedge.</HI> Tho&s;e who have &s;een men cleave timber, cannot be at a lo&s;s to know that the wedge is a piece of wood or iron, thin at one end and thick at the back; that the thin or trenchant end is applied to the timber to be cleft, and the thick end &s;truck upon by an hammer. Mechani&s;ts have long debated, and &s;till continue the argument, con|cerning the force of the wedge. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> con&s;iders the wedge as two common
<PB N="237" REF="256">
levers inclined to each other, and acting in oppo&s;ite directions. <HI>Guido Ubaldus</HI> refers it to the &s;econd order of levers; others again, re&s;olve its action into that of inclined planes; and there are &s;ome &s;till, who will not allow that the wedge gives the &s;triker any force what&s;oever. To &s;ay the truth, there are &s;o many natural ob&s;tructions to the illu&s;tration of a theory concerning this in&s;trument, that it is almo&s;t an u&s;ele&s;s matter, to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule which no experiment can be made to confirm. The particular ca&s;es that ob|&s;truct its general theory, are either the ela&s;ticity of the wood to be cleaved, or the ela&s;ticity of the hammer that &s;trikes, or of the wedge it&s;elf. The manner in which the wood yields to the impre&s;&s;ion of the wedge, either in being &s;plit, or cut through by it; for if &s;plit, it only touches the wedge on each &s;ide in one place; if cut through, the wood lies clo&s;e to the whole &s;urface of the cutter's in&s;trument. Other con&s;iderations might be mentioned, but in &s;hort, the ca&s;es are
<PB N="238" REF="257">
&s;o various, that no theory can be brought to direct every experiment; nor no one experiment to confirm the theory. The following method of e&s;timating the wedge's force, &s;eems liable to exceptions. As much as the length of the wedge exceeds the width of its thick end or ba&s;e, &s;o much will the driver's power be increa&s;ed, in overcoming the re&s;i&s;tance of the wood to be cleft. If, for in&s;tance, the wedge be twice as long as another who&s;e thick end is equally broad, the driver will cleave his wood with twice greater force with the former than with the latter. To prove this, if we &s;uppo&s;e the wedge driven to its head into a block of timber, (fig. 32.) the length of the wedge A B will repre&s;ent the &s;pace the driving force is gone through; the breadth of the wedge D C, the &s;pace through which it has been driven, on each &s;ide, the re&s;i&s;ting force of the timber. Now we &s;ee that to drive the re&s;i&s;ting forces through the &s;paces C and D, a driving power is employed,

which goes through the greater &s;pace A B. That is, in fact, if A B exceeds D C, &s;o much will the driving force, which A B repre&s;ents, exceed the re&s;i&s;ting force. Or in other words, if the length of the wedge be greater than its thick|ne&s;s, the driver's power will al&s;o be greater than the re&s;i&s;tance of the timber; if the wedge be but ju&s;t as long as it is thick, the driver will have no advantage what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE mechanic power that comes next is the <HI>&s;crew,</HI> with which mo&s;t people are &s;o well acquainted, that it needs no de&s;cription. With this in&s;trument our pre&s;&s;es are u&s;ually driven clo&s;e together with &s;urprizing force, and held during plea&s;ure in that po&s;ition. It cannot pro|perly be called a &s;imple machine, becau&s;e it calls in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lever to increa&s;e its force, which is u&s;ually ap|plied in the manner of an handle, to turn its &s;ocket upon it. (Fig. 33.) To e&s;timate the force of this machine, let us
<PB N="240" REF="260">
&s;uppo&s;e that I de&s;ire to &s;crew down the pre&s;s G upon B; every turn I make once round with both handles, I &s;hall drive the pre&s;s only one &s;piral nearer to B; &s;o that if there be eleven &s;pirals, I mu&s;t make eleven turns of the handles F L, before I come to the bottom. In pre&s;&s;ing down the &s;crew therefore, I act with a force as much &s;uperior to the re&s;i&s;tance of the body I de&s;ire to pre&s;s, as the circumference of the circle, which my hands de&s;cribe in turning the machine, exceeds the di&s;tance between two little &s;pirals of the &s;crew. For in&s;tance, &s;up|po&s;e the di&s;tance between the two &s;pirals to be half an inch, and the length of both handles 12 inches. My hands placed upon them in going round will de&s;cribe a circle, which upon calculation will be found to be 76 inches nearly, and con&s;equently this will be an hundred and fifty two times greater than half an inch, which was the di&s;tance between two of the &s;pirals. Thus, if a body is to be pre&s;&s;ed down with this machine,
<PB N="241" REF="261">
one man will pre&s;s it with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as much as an hundred and fifty two men without it. Or if the &s;crew were &s;o contrived as to rai&s;e the weight in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing it, which it &s;ometimes is, the human force would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame proportion with the &s;ame in&s;tru|ment. But we here only talk as if the handles of the &s;crew were but twelve inches acro&s;s, and the &s;pirals a whole half inch di&s;tant from each other; what if we &s;uppo&s;ed the handles five times as long, and the &s;pirals five times as clo&s;e! the increa&s;e of the human force then would be a&s;toni&s;hing!</P>
<P>TO the&s;e, which u&s;ually go by the name of mechanic powers, and of which alone all complicated machines what&s;o|ever are &s;uppo&s;ed to be made up, and each of which act but with one power on the weight at a time; to the&s;e, I &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Varignon</HI> has added one more, which he calls <HI>La Machine Funiculaire.</HI> This is a compo&s;ition of cords, many
<PB N="242" REF="262">
of which different powers act upon one or more weights at the &s;ame time; and by which, from their con&s;piring with each other, a greater force is exerted than would ari&s;e from the &s;um of all the cords, &s;ingly applied to the weight to be removed. They who have &s;een the common ludicrous method of placing three &s;poons upon a table each &s;upporting and &s;upported, will have &s;ome idea of a machine of this nature.</P>
<P>SOME add to the&s;e powers al&s;o the inclined plane, and indeed not without rea&s;on, if dimini&s;hing the weight of a body laid upon it can entitle it to the name. The properties of the inclined plane we have con&s;idered already; we &s;hall only here &s;ay, that the more the plane is inclined, the ea&s;ier a body may be rolled or forced up its &s;urface; or in other words, the advantage we gain by it &s;o much exceeds the ab&s;olute weight to be rai&s;ed, as the length of the plane exceeds its height. Suppo&s;e CD (fig. 34.)
<PB N="243" REF="263">
be an inclined plane, and &s;uppo&s;e its whole length be three times as great as its perpendicular height F G; in this ca&s;e the roller E will be &s;upported upon the plane, and kept from rolling down by a power equal to a third part of the roller's weight. A weight there|fore may be rolled up this plane, with three times greater ea&s;e than it could be lifted up directly from the perpendicular G to F.</P>
<P>BY one or more of the&s;e &s;imple powers, all great weights are rai&s;ed to con&s;iderable heights; but in them all, the more they dimini&s;h the weight, the more &s;low they are in their operations, and con&s;equently the more do they retard the workman's di&s;patch; and univer&s;ally the more &s;imple they are, the more ex|peditious. Be&s;ides this, their friction or rubbing again&s;t each other, greatly dimini&s;hes their power. The friction in the balance is lea&s;t, it is more in the lever, increa&s;ed in the axle and wheel,
<PB N="244" REF="264">
yet more in the pulley, but mo&s;t of all in the &s;crew. In general, in combined engines, upon account of this friction, they will require a third part more of power to move them, than the theory allows. For this rea&s;on therefore, it will for ever be impo&s;&s;ible to fulfil the boa&s;t of <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who vaunted that he could pull up an oak by the roots with a &s;ingle hor&s;e-hair; for the force requi|&s;ite to work the machine in pulling it up, would nearly amount to a third part of the force which the machine exerts. The large cap&s;tan and pulley, u&s;ed in launching a man of war, would in theory do it mo&s;t effectually. A &s;imple lever, drawn a proper length by the imagination, would do it as well; it would even fulfil the great boa&s;t of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> it would remove the earth it&s;elf. The learned often amu&s;e them|&s;elves with fancies like the&s;e; and it was for this that <HI>Cicero,</HI> who was per|haps the wi&s;e&s;t man, called <HI>Archimedes</HI> a trifler.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of Man, con&s;idered as an artificial Machine.</HEAD>
<P>MAN has been con&s;idered by anatomi&s;ts, as a &s;y&s;tem of all the artificial machines united in the human fabric; they have found the lever, the pul|ley, the axle in the wheel, the wedge, and even the &s;crew, or at lea&s;t &s;omething re|&s;embling each of them, in his per&s;on: thus, his arms have been likened to levers, his head turning upon its axle, the diga&s;tric mu&s;cle that a&s;&s;i&s;ts his &s;wallowing, to a rope running over its pulley, the glands as lifting up their fluids in the manner of an artificial water &s;crew, and his teeth have been compared to wedges. But &s;ome have not &s;topt here, they have gone on not only to plea&s;e them&s;elves with the re&s;emblance, but to e&s;timate the force of man through all his vital and in|voluntary motions, &s;uch as the running of the blood through his veins, the
<PB N="246" REF="266">
drawing his breath, and &s;uch like, by the inflexible laws of mechani&s;m. They have even applied geometrical rules to mea&s;ure objects con&s;tantly in change, and built theories upon proportions they were unable to di&s;cover. Thus when <HI>Borelli</HI> once got the hint of comparing the mu&s;cles or fle&s;hy parts to cords, he then readily built this theory, and calculated the human force, by con&s;idering the thickne&s;s of the cords, and the length of the lever. Thus, when another found the &s;imilitude between the blood running through its channels, and water &s;pouting through pipes, he pur&s;ued the &s;pecu|lation, till he at la&s;t was taught to believe that vomits would cure a &s;pitting of blood, and bathing in warm water would be a remedy for the drop&s;y; happy how|ever, had his theory never been put into practice.</P>
<P>IT is as impo&s;&s;ible to determine the mu&s;cular force of any man, by the bare in&s;pection or admea&s;urement of his
<PB N="247" REF="267">
mu&s;cles, as it is to mea&s;ure the &s;wiftne&s;s of the circulation of his fluids, by the &s;pouting of his blood from a vein. Neither can be done, though <HI>Cheyne</HI> has pretended to demon&s;trate, that if we compare the mu&s;cular &s;trength of two animals, that animal who&s;e fluids circulate twice as &s;wift, will be &s;ix times as &s;trong. <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Wainright</HI> adopted his demon&s;tration, for he called it a demon&s;tration, and indeed it was drawn up with a &s;ufficient degree of mathematical parade. <HI>Martin</HI> however, in a treati&s;e entitled <HI>de &s;imilibus animalibus,</HI> has demon&s;trated that <HI>Cheyne</HI>'s demon&s;tration was fal&s;e; but it was in order to e&s;tabli&s;h another demon&s;tration of his own. He a&s;&s;erted, that the force in &s;imilar animals, was as the cube roots of the fourth powers of the limb put into motion. The learner will not perhaps under&s;tand the preci&s;e meaning of the&s;e words, but it is no matter, for his de|mon&s;tration is as fal&s;e as the former.</P>
<P>FROM the mere dimen&s;ions of the mu&s;cles in two &s;imilar animals, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="248" REF="268">
to determine their force. The &s;trength of the mu&s;cle is generally more in proportion to the exerci&s;e it has been employed in, than to its &s;ize; the legs of a chairman are &s;tronger, the arms of a &s;mith; in &s;hort, to u&s;e the words of a bully, in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> comedy, who mi&s;took his man and was beaten, we can never know the &s;trength of the mu&s;cles, till we experience their effects.</P>
<P>BUT though we cannot determine with any preci&s;ion, of two men which are &s;tronge&s;t, yet in the &s;ame man, we can compare the force of his mu&s;cles with rather more preci&s;ion: this at lea&s;t can be &s;aid with great certainty, that tho&s;e mu&s;cles which are in&s;erted into the bone, neare&s;t to the place where it moves upon another, overcome the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently act with the greate&s;t force. But to a learner this wants explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="269">ALL our fle&s;h is compo&s;ed of mu&s;cles, which (if I may u&s;e a vulgar &s;imilitude) are like red ribbands, and almo&s;t all have one of their ends fixed into one bone, and another of their ends into &s;ome other bone. Thus, if we feel the great ham-&s;tring, which is made up of many mu&s;cles, we &s;hall find that at one end it is fixed into the bones of the leg, ju&s;t under the knee, and at the other end it runs upwards, partly to be fixed in the great bone of the thigh. The mu&s;cles being thus &s;tretched from one bone to another, have a wonderful power of contracting and &s;hortening them|&s;elves at plea&s;ure; and when we chu&s;e to put them into action, they &s;well in the middle, &s;omewhat into the &s;hape of a ninepin. As the&s;e mu&s;cles thus contract, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily draw the two bones, into which they are in&s;erted, their own way; the ham-&s;tring, when it contracts, for in&s;tance, draws the leg backward toward the thigh; when we want to make the limb &s;traight, there are mu&s;cles
<PB N="250" REF="270">
in&s;erted under the fore part of the knee, that contracting, an&s;wer this pur|po&s;e; while, in the mean time, the ham-&s;tring &s;uffers it&s;elf to be relaxed, in order to let the oppo&s;ing mu&s;cles take effect. This being under&s;tood, it will follow, that if we con&s;ider any one of the bones, the arm bone for in&s;tance, as a beam, and the mu&s;cles that rai&s;e it and put it into motion, as the power that agitates and works the in&s;trument, the whole will give us the idea of the third kind of lever, where the prop is at one end, the weight to be &s;u&s;tained at the other, and the &s;trength is applied between them both. Thus for in&s;tance, if I &s;tretch out my arm, the prop is in the joint of my &s;houlder, the weight is my hand, and the rai&s;ing power is the mu&s;cles, which are fixed into the arm bone near the &s;houlder, and go from thence to be in&s;erted into the bones of the trunk of my body. Now the nearer the &s;houlder the&s;e mu&s;cles are in&s;erted into the arm bone, it is evident that the longer will
<PB N="251" REF="271">
be the lever, again&s;t which they are to act, and con&s;equently the greater will ap|pear the weight which they are to &s;u&s;tain. To make this quite plain, &s;uppo&s;e a ladder were laid flat on the ground; and &s;up|po&s;e that I &s;tanding at one end, take the neare&s;t round of the ladder in both my hands, and thus pulling back attempt to rai&s;e the farthe&s;t end, keeping the neare&s;t end &s;till &s;teady to the ground. Would not this require immen&s;e &s;trength to effect? Pretty &s;imilar is the force that the mu&s;cles of the arm exert in rai&s;ing the whole length of the arm, and the weight of the hand be&s;ide. They are in&s;erted into the bone clo&s;e to the &s;houlder, and &s;upport the whole length of the arm in the de&s;ired direction. But what is more, they do not only act upon the lever at &s;o di&s;advantageous a di&s;tance, but al&s;o they act upon it in a direction the mo&s;t oblique, and con&s;equently at a greater di&s;advantage &s;till. Suppo&s;e I attempt to rai&s;e the di&s;tant end of the ladder by pulling the round neare&s;t me; this, as I
<PB N="252" REF="272">
&s;aid, will be very di&s;advantageous: but &s;uppo&s;e yet farther, that I &s;hould fir&s;t lie upon my back, and then by drawing the next round to me of the ladder, I &s;hould attempt to rai&s;e the di&s;tant end; the force that would be capable of effect|ing this, would be incredible. Yet in this very manner it is that the mu&s;cles of the &s;houlder act, in rai&s;ing the arm. They are not only in&s;erted at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the weight, but they exert their power the mo&s;t obliquely. The force they exert in keeping the hand and arm extended is great; the force they exert in keeping it extended, while the hand holds a weight of about twenty pounds, is a&s;toni&s;hing. Some &s;ay that the&s;e mu&s;cles, upon equal terms, would lift a weight ten thou&s;and times greater. What has been here &s;aid of the mu&s;cles of the arm, is true, in a greater or le&s;s degree, of all the mu&s;cles of the body; &s;o that this natural machine, thus fa&s;hioned by the Great Workman, is infinitely more powerful than any
<PB N="253" REF="273">
artificial machine that man could form, though it took up four times the &s;pace.</P>
<P>THE mu&s;cles, as we &s;aid, are &s;up|ported by bones; the&s;e make altogether a &s;ingle pillar or column, which though not perfectly &s;traight, but with about five different curvatures or bendings; yet when perfectly balanced upon it&s;elf, will actually &s;upport weights that would &s;urpri&s;e the inexperienced. <HI>La Hire,</HI> and <HI>De&s;aguliers</HI> give us &s;everal accounts of the amazing weight &s;ome people have &s;u&s;tained, when they were able to fix the pillar of their bones directly beneath it. The latter tells of a <HI>German</HI> who &s;hewed &s;everal feats of this kind at <HI>London,</HI> and who performed before the King and a part of the royal family. This man, being placed in a proper &s;ituation, with a belt which re&s;ted upon his head and &s;houlders, and which was fixed below to a cannon of four thou&s;and weight, had the props which &s;upported
<PB N="254" REF="274">
the cannon taken away, and by fixing the pillar of his bones immoveably again&s;t the weight, &s;upported it with &s;eeming unconcern. There are few that have not &s;een tho&s;e men, who, catching a hor&s;e by the tail, and placing them|&s;elves in direct oppo&s;ition to the animal's motion, have thus &s;topt the hor&s;e, though whipped by his rider to proceed. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, the pillar of the bones is placed in direct oppo&s;ition to the weight; they &s;upport each other, and are pre|vented from rubbing or cracking by ela&s;tic gri&s;tles fixed between each bone; the&s;e give way a little upon great pre&s;&s;ure, and re&s;tore them&s;elves almo&s;t in&s;tantly, when that is removed. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a vi&s;cous or &s;limy liquor that is &s;queezed in, as if from a &s;ponge, between every joint, and keeps the&s;e gri&s;tles &s;mooth, moi&s;t, and pliant. By means of this fluid, all the joints move ea&s;ily, and obey the impul&s;e of the mu&s;cles with greater di&s;patch. This fluid, and the gri&s;tles (or cartilages, as
<PB N="255" REF="275">
anatomi&s;ts call them) contribute not a little to the &s;trength of the animal; they re&s;i&s;t the burthen with an ela&s;tic force, and conform them&s;elves to the inequality of the pre&s;&s;ure. In old age both are dimini&s;hed, the gri&s;tles become hard, and this liquor (which anatomi&s;ts call the &s;ynovia) is &s;queezed out in le&s;s quantities. The man therefore, in old age, becomes more &s;tiff and more weak, chiefly upon this account, though partly becau&s;e his mu&s;cles become then al&s;o more rigid, hard, and le&s;s fle&s;hy, as it is u&s;ually called; as tho&s;e who have eaten the fle&s;h of old animals know. While we are at re&s;t, this fluid, or &s;ynovia above mentioned, oozes out between the joints, to fit them for the hour of action; when in exerci&s;e, the ends of the bones pre&s;s again&s;t their gri&s;tles, and the&s;e are &s;eparated in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the &s;ynovia or fluid; but there is &s;till another liquor of an oily nature, which is pre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time from a &s;mall fle&s;hy &s;ponge, placed in every joint, and
<PB N="256" REF="276">
this mixing with the &s;ynovia, makes all &s;upple and fit for bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;aid, that the &s;ynovia or vi&s;cid liquor oozes out between the joints in the hour of re&s;t; it is there|fore in greate&s;t quantity between them, in the morning, after we have taken our re&s;t the preceding night. So great is the quantity u&s;ually &s;eparated during &s;leep, between the joints of the back bone, that &s;ome men are an inch taller in the morning than at night, and all men are &s;omewhat taller, as may be quickly found by any who chu&s;e to make the experiment upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid it appears, that in carrying large burdens, the whole art con&s;i&s;ts in keeping the co|lumn of the body as directly under the weight as po&s;&s;ible, and the body as up|right under the weight as we can. For if the center of gravity in the burthen, falls without this column, it will go near to fall; in fact, if the &s;upporter were an inanimate machine, it would fall inevi|tably;
<PB N="257" REF="277">
but human power, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, catches the center while yet be|ginning to de&s;cend, and re&s;tores the balance which it had lo&s;t the moment before. A man balancing under a weight, re&s;embles one of tho&s;e people whom we u&s;ually &s;ee walking upon a wire; they totter from &s;ide to &s;ide, for a moment lo&s;e the center of gravity, but by throwing forward a limb or di&s;torting their bodies they recover it again, to the great amu&s;e|ment of every &s;pectator. It is thus, that he who carries a weight is obliged to act; on whatever part of his body the weight is placed, he balances it by throwing as much of his column beneath the load as he can. Could the weight be laid and evenly balanced upon him, &s;tanding in his natural po&s;ture, he could, as we ob&s;erved before, &s;upport an incredible burthen; and though he could not move under what he could thus &s;upport, yet he could carry a much greater load, than if the burthen were laid in any other manner. The weight a man could &s;upport, when thus
<PB N="258" REF="278">
evenly laid upon his &s;houlders, would break the back of the &s;tronge&s;t hor&s;e in the world. The rea&s;on is obvious. In a man, the whole column of bones &s;up|ports the weight directly; in an hor&s;e, the weight is laid upon the column cro&s;s ways. The porters of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> are known to carry each a weight of nine hundred pounds; they lean upon a &s;taff while loaded, and are unloaded in the &s;ame manner. The por|ters of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in <HI>France</HI> are found to carry yet more; their manner is this: four of them carry the burthen between them, each having a &s;ort of hood that covers the temples and head down to the &s;houlders; to this is fa&s;tened the cords that &s;upport the frame or bier, on which the weight is laid. By this contrivance the whole column of the bones acts directly again&s;t the load, and an immen&s;e weight is thus &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>WE now therefore at length &s;ee the rea&s;on why two men carrying a load
<PB N="259" REF="279">
between them, can &s;u&s;tain a greater weight than what either could &s;epa|rately carry, if it were divided into two equal parts. The rea&s;on is, that two men can bear the load each more upright, and with the column of their bones more oppo&s;ed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>AS man bears a weight the better, the more upright he &s;tands again&s;t it, it mu&s;t follow nece&s;&s;arily, that the more bendings he makes in &s;upporting weights, the le&s;s will be his power. There are three principal bendings in the human column; the fir&s;t at the hams, the &s;econd at the hips, and the third along the back bone, which re&s;embles the o&s;ier in pliancy, though it be &s;tronger than the oak. A man of ordinary &s;tature and &s;trength, upon an average, has been computed to weigh an hundred and &s;ixty pounds; he can &s;upport, as we &s;aid before, an immen&s;e weight if his column acts directly again&s;t it; if he bends a little at the hams, &s;uch a man
<PB N="260" REF="280">
may rai&s;e from the ground about an hundred and &s;eventy pounds, provided the weights are placed to the greate&s;t ad|vantage. If he bends at the hips and back, he will lift thirty pounds le&s;s. If a weight be placed upon his head, and he be put between the rounds of a ladder placed horizontally and brea&s;t high, he can lift thirty pounds by the &s;trength of the mu&s;cles of his &s;houlders and neck alone.</P>
<P>FROM this we &s;ee, that human &s;trength is not the fourth part as great when the body is bent, as when it is upright. From this al&s;o we &s;ee, that if a man draws a load after him, as in that ca&s;e all his mu&s;cles act in an oblique direction, he can exert but very little force, when compared to other animals. <HI>De&s;agulier</HI> pretends to &s;ay, that an hor&s;e can draw as much, upon an average, as five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> workmen. The <HI>French</HI> writers &s;ay, Dr. <HI>Barthes</HI> in particular, that an hor&s;e can draw as much as &s;ix <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> or
<PB N="261" REF="281">
&s;even <HI>Dutchmen</HI>; but if the load were to be placed upon the &s;houlders, two men will be found to be as &s;trong as an hor&s;e. A <HI>London</HI> porter &s;hall carry three hundred weight at the rate of three miles an hour; two chairmen carry an hundred and fifty pounds each, and walk at the rate of four miles an hour. Whereas a travelling hor&s;e &s;eldom carries above two hundred weight, and a day's journey with &s;uch a load, would be apt to di&s;qualify him from travelling the day following.</P>
<P>MAN's greate&s;t force therefore, is directly upward; if he draws a load, he mu&s;t act at a di&s;advantage. A man how|ever, when obliged to draw a load, a rolling &s;tone for in&s;tance, hath two methods of doing this. He may either turn his back to the &s;tone, and pu&s;hing the frame with his brea&s;t, thus go on|ward, while the &s;tone rolls after; or he may turn his face to the &s;tone, and go backward, drawing the &s;tone with
<PB N="262" REF="282">
him. This la&s;t method may be the mo&s;t inconvenient, but it gives the workman much the greate&s;t &s;hare of power, and that for two rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place, by inclining farther back, he can give a greater column of his body to the draft; and in the next place, a greater number of his mu&s;cles come into action; particu|larly the two great deltoid mu&s;cles of the arms, the force of which is very great. It is for this rea&s;on that men who row a boat, more u&s;ually draw the oar to them, than pu&s;h it from them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of Wheel Carriages.</HEAD>
<P>BY what we have &s;een of man con|&s;idered as a machine, it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve that his frame is not adapted to drawing carriages; while on the con|trary, in that of an animal upon all fours, the column of who&s;e bodies, and the &s;ituation of who&s;e mu&s;cles, act almo&s;t directly upon bodies placed behind them, they are perfectly fitted by nature for this kind of &s;ervice. Hor&s;es are u&s;ually employed in the draft in <HI>England</HI>; mules, oxen, &s;heep, and other animals are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in other parts of the world. It might incur ridicule if we pretended to inform the learner that each of the&s;e will draw a weight or carriage in proportion as they are &s;trong. But notwith&s;tanding this is generally the ca&s;e, yet we are going to mention what will &s;eem a paradox; namely, that two hor&s;es may be found, one &s;tronger than the
<PB N="264" REF="284">
other, and al&s;o better &s;killed in the draft, yet the weaker &s;hall draw a weight, with the very &s;ame carriage, the &s;tronger one could not remove! This will be effected, if the weake&s;t hor&s;e be the hea|vie&s;t; if he exceeds his antagoni&s;t more in weight, than he is exceeded in &s;trength. We have ob&s;erved in a former chapter, that the weight re-acts or pulls back the hor&s;e, as much as the hor&s;e acts upon the weight to pull it forward. Now the hor&s;e has two &s;ources of power in drawing the weight along; his &s;trength, which gives him velocity, and his weight, which added gives force; and it is evident that the hor&s;e which hath both in the greate&s;t proportion, will draw the heavie&s;t weights. If we &s;hould ima|gine both hor&s;es rai&s;ing an equal weight from a deep pit, and this weight &s;till increa&s;ed, &s;o as to overcome their &s;trength, it is plain that the lighte&s;t hor&s;e would &s;oone&s;t be drawn in. We have &s;everal in&s;tances in ordinary practice, of the great benefit of increa&s;ing the hor&s;e's
<PB N="265" REF="285">
weight, to promote his draught; for in many places, hor&s;es employed in turning a mill have a &s;mall load laid upon their backs, which, though it takes away &s;ome|thing from their velocity, adds to their weight, and con&s;equently increa&s;es their force.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;trength, &s;kill and weight of two hor&s;es to be the &s;ame, all the difference then in their drawing the &s;ame weights, will ari&s;e from the com|modiou&s;ne&s;s of the machine, in which they draw. If the load they are to drag after them be brea&s;t high, they can draw it with much greater ea&s;e than if it lay along the ground. They can, for in&s;tance, draw much greater draughts, if the weights are laid upon a &s;ledge as high as the hor&s;e's &s;houlders, than if the &s;ame weights were laid upon a low &s;ledge on the ground. For in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the column of their bodies acts directly again&s;t the weight, in the latter it acts obliquely; and we have &s;hewn before,
<PB N="266" REF="286">
that the more directly this column can act, the greater is its force. Even in either going up hill or down hill, the &s;ledge brea&s;t high is more commodious than that laid low. For if the low &s;ledge is dragged up an hill, it is plain that it will be then lower, with re&s;pect to the hor&s;es, than it was before, and con&s;e|quently they will be obliged to draw it more obliquely upwards, than when they drew it along the plain. If on the contrary, the low &s;ledge is drawn down an hill, it will then be higher with re&s;pect to the hor&s;es than when on the plain, and therefore their power of drawing it will be greater; but in going down an hill, its own gravity con&s;pires with the draught, and will al&s;o help the load to de&s;cend, &s;o that the hor&s;es in this ca&s;e are permitted to exert their greate&s;t power where there is the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity; they can draw the low &s;ledge down hill with all their power, when by the natural de&s;cending of the load, they are not permitted to exert it.
<PB N="267" REF="287">
This doctrine however, &s;imple as it is, is different from what is u&s;ually taught by mechani&s;ts, upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>SLEDGES were probably the fir&s;t ma|chines u&s;ed in carrying loads; we find them thus employed in <HI>Homer,</HI> I mean in the original, in conveying wood for the funeral pile of <HI>Patroclus.</HI> There are &s;ome countries al&s;o, that pre&s;erve their u&s;e to this day. However, men early began to find how much more ea&s;ily a machine could be drawn upon a rough road, that run upon wheels, than one that thus went with a &s;liding motion. And indeed, if all &s;urfaces were &s;mooth and even, bodies could be drawn with as much ea&s;e upon a &s;ledge as upon wheels; and in <HI>Holland, Lap|land,</HI> and other countries, they u&s;e &s;ledges upon the &s;mooth &s;urface of the ice; for as every &s;urface upon which we travel, is u&s;ually rough, wheels have been made u&s;e of, which rub le&s;s again&s;t the inequalities than &s;ledges would do.
<PB N="268" REF="288">
In fact, wheels would not turn at all upon ice, if it were perfectly &s;mooth, for the cau&s;e of the wheels turning upon a common road, is the ob&s;tacles it continually meets. For if we &s;uppo&s;e the wheels to be lifted from the ground, and carried along in the air, the wheels in this ca&s;e would not turn at all, for there would be nothing to put any part into motion rather than another; in the &s;ame manner, if they were carried along upon perfectly &s;mooth ice, they would meet nothing to give a beginning to the circulatory mo|tion, and all their parts would re&s;t equally alike. But if we &s;uppo&s;e the wheel drawn along a common road, then the parts will receive unequal ob&s;tructions, for it meets with ob&s;tacles that retard it at bottom, therefore the upper part of the wheel, which is not retarded, will move more &s;wiftly than the lower part, which is; but this it cannot do, unle&s;s the wheel moves round. And thus it is, that the ob&s;tacles in the rough road cau&s;e this circulatory motion in the wheel.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="289">THIS rotation of the wheels about their axle, very much dimini&s;hes that friction which always attends the weight's being drawn along upon a &s;ledge; and this in &s;o great a proportion, that ac|cording to <HI>Hel&s;ham,</HI> a carriage drawn by four wheels, will be drawn with five times as &s;mall an effort as one that &s;lides upon the &s;ame &s;urface in a &s;ledge. Still more to dimini&s;h the friction in wheel carriages, a countryman of our own hath found out an expedient, whereby the axle, contrary to what is u&s;ual in mo&s;t carriages, is made to turn round, and its gudgeons or ends, in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the boxes as in common wheels, are made to bear on the circumference of moveable wheels; &s;o that by this con|trivance, a number of parts are made to roll one over the other, which &s;lided before: &s;uch wheels, from their thus dimini&s;hing the friction, are called friction wheels. We &s;hall enter no farther into their theory or u&s;es; the &s;ingle in&s;pection of the machine it&s;elf
<PB N="270" REF="290">
would throw more light upon the &s;ubject, than we could do in pages.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee how much a wheel carriage a&s;&s;i&s;ts the hor&s;e in drawing, &s;uperior to a &s;ledge or any other machine without wheels. Now if we compare wheel carriages with each other, and we de&s;ire to know whether large or &s;mall wheels are be&s;t in a machine; the an&s;wer will be, that large wheels are ea&s;ie&s;t for the hor&s;e, but &s;mall wheels &s;afe&s;t for the rider. A large wheel has a double ad|vantage over a &s;mall one, either in &s;ur|mounting ob&s;tacles, or in depre&s;&s;ing them. To prove this, let us &s;uppo&s;e two wheels, (fig. 35.) A and B, the one large, the other &s;mall. As the circumference of both may be con&s;idered, like all other circles, as compo&s;ed of a number of right lines; we may &s;uppo&s;e both endeavouring to overcome the ob&s;tacle C, with the &s;poke of either con&s;idered as levers, the large wheel with a lever equal in length to B g, the &s;maller with
<PB N="271" REF="291">
a lever equal to F g. But the longer the lever, the greater the moving power is increa&s;ed; it is evident therefore, that the hor&s;e drawing at D B, where the lever is long, will have far greater power to overcome the ob&s;tacle, than if he drew at F E, where the lever is &s;hort, and therefore the larger wheel has the advantage. The hor&s;e will draw &s;uch a wheel with greater ea&s;e over the ob&s;tacle, or pre&s;s the ob&s;tacle down into the earth with greater force. As wheels cannot always run upon hard ground, but mu&s;t frequently meet with holes, in which they partly &s;ink; in this ca&s;e al&s;o the large wheel will have the advantage over the &s;mall, for it pre&s;&s;es a larger &s;urface upon the &s;inking earth, and it will not therefore &s;ink &s;o deep; thus a man can ea&s;ily thru&s;t his finger into &s;oft clay, but it will give more re&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould he attempt to thru&s;t his fi&s;t.</P>
<P>LARGE wheels have the advantage of &s;mall wheels, in having le&s;s friction
<PB N="272" REF="292">
round their axles; for if the &s;mall one turns an hundred times in going over a certain piece of road, the larger wheel will not turn by any means &s;o often to travel the &s;ame length, and the le&s;s the wheel turns, the le&s;s will the friction be. And this frequency of turning required in &s;mall wheels, as al&s;o the greater ob&s;ta|cles they continually meet with, is the rea&s;on why they are more frequently out of order, and &s;tand in need of repair much oftener than the large.</P>
<P>LASTLY, large wheels have the ad|vantage of &s;mall wheels, by better directing the load again&s;t the column of the hor&s;e's body, either in going up or down hill. If the hor&s;e draws the load up hill, the wheels being large, rai&s;e the weight, more directly to be acted upon by the column of his body; if the hor&s;e goes down hill, the wheels being large, rai&s;e the weight high above the hor&s;e's power, and con&s;equently thus dimini&s;h his power; but then it is at
<PB N="273" REF="293">
a time when he hath lea&s;t occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it, for the load in &s;ome mea&s;ure will then de&s;cend of it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I take no notice here to the young &s;tudent, concerning the preference of &s;mall wheels in going up a&s;cents, for which there are &s;ome pretended demon&s;trations; my rea&s;on is, that tho&s;e demon|&s;trations are fal&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, with re&s;pect to the draught, large wheels are preferable to the &s;mall, and therefore we nece&s;&s;arily expect to find all our coaches, waggons, and other four wheel car|riages, have the fore wheels as large as the hinder. If a waggoner is a&s;ked the rea&s;on why this is not &s;o, his an&s;wer is, that by making the foremo&s;t lea&s;t, the hinder wheels thus drive on the fir&s;t. This however is by no means the true rea&s;on; the fore wheels are made thus &s;maller than the hinder, both for the conveniency of turning with greater ea&s;e, and becau&s;e the carriage being thus &s;up|ported
<PB N="274" REF="294">
upon unequal wheels, it will be in le&s;s danger of overturning. They thus al&s;o avoid cutting the braces or &s;traps, by which the hor&s;es draw. In heavy waggons however, where the nece&s;&s;ity of turning is but &s;eldom, and the danger of overturning &s;carce any, and the braces are removed at a di&s;tance, if the fore wheels were made as high as the hinder ones, it would be &s;o much the better. As it is however, waggoners &s;hould lay the load equally upon all the wheels; but on the contrary, they are univer|&s;ally found to lay the greate&s;t part of the load upon the two fore wheels, which not only makes the friction greate&s;t, where it ought to be lea&s;t, but al&s;o pre&s;&s;es the fore wheels deeper into the ground than the hinder ones, which we ob&s;erved before, were mo&s;t apt to &s;ink, without this additional di&s;advantage. The only danger that might re&s;ult from the waggon's being evenly loaded would be, that in drawing up &s;teep hills, the load might be apt to fall backward, and
<PB N="275" REF="295">
thus tilt up the fore wheels of the carriage. This might ea&s;ily be remedied, by a ma|chine placed under the fore part of the waggon, which, upon the carriage's going up hill, might be &s;o contrived, as to let &s;ink the foremo&s;t end of the load, and thus keep the whole &s;till even.</P>
<P>IT now only remains to &s;ay &s;ome|thing with re&s;pect to the breadth of the wheels. Some have in&s;i&s;ted that broad wheels are be&s;t for the draught, and build their a&s;&s;ertions upon theory and experiment; others, on the contrary, and the whole body of carriers in particular, taught by experience, give the preference to the narrow. The determination of this di&s;pute mu&s;t be left to others, more &s;kilful in waggons and broad wheels than I can pretend to be; a word or two will &s;uffice. If we &s;uppo&s;e the broad wheel to have three times the breadth of the narrow wheel, it will meet with three times as many ob&s;tacles by the way, but the narrow wheel will &s;ink three times as deep; the que&s;tion therefore is, whether
<PB N="276" REF="296">
three times the ob&s;tacles at the &s;urface of the ground, is greater or le&s;s than three times the ob&s;tacle beneath the &s;ur|face? The an&s;wer will be, that the three ob&s;tacles at the &s;urface will be much ea&s;ier removed than the three beneath it; for they lie lighter, and are &s;ooner thru&s;t out of the way. But however this may be in theory, in experience it is otherwi&s;e; for the narrow wheel does not &s;ink three times as deep as the broad, becau&s;e the earth hardens by the pre&s;&s;ure under it, as it de&s;cends; on the contrary, the broad actually encounters three times as many ob&s;tacles. However, though the latter may not be &s;o good for the carriers, yet they are certainly good for the roads, and therefore for the public in general. Private di&s;advantage mu&s;t ever be po&s;tponed to public utility.</P>
<P>THUS much will &s;uffice upon the principles of mechani&s;m in general; to enter upon a de&s;cription of particular artificial machines, would be both unin|&s;tructing, and indeed foreign from the
<PB N="277" REF="297">
purport of a &s;cience, that pretends only to explain the wonders of nature. To give any idea of machines, plates would be requi&s;ite, and even &s;uch would make but an ob&s;cure impre&s;&s;ion. The be&s;t way to under&s;tand the arts of machinery is, to view them as they really exi&s;t, to vi&s;it the &s;hops of artificers, or the yards where great works are carried on. To be a good mechani&s;t would take up a whole life, and the art is rather perfected by practice than theory. For in&s;tance, theori&s;ts have long debated what is the proper angle of obliquity, by which the &s;ails of a wind-mill are to be regulated and fixed, and whether they are to be elliptical, or on the con|trary oblong: practice at pre&s;ent &s;eems to follow the opinions of neither &s;ide; the &s;ail is made to bo&s;om upon the wind, like the &s;ail of a &s;hip. In &s;hort, the principles of mechani&s;m may be learned in books, the art mu&s;t be acquired by experience. Several volumes have been written upon the &s;ubject; &s;hould we, upon the pre&s;ent
<PB N="278" REF="298">
occa&s;ion, enter into a de&s;cription of but a few machines, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ay either too little, or too much: too little to give the learner an adequate idea of any of them; too much for an elementary treati&s;e upon natural philo&s;ophy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of Friction and the Re&s;i&s;tance of Fluids.</HEAD>
<P>THROUGH the whole former theory of motion, we have &s;up|po&s;ed that machines did not rub again&s;t each other, and &s;o interrupt their mutual workings. We &s;uppo&s;ed that all the planes on which they moved were even, all the levers inflexible, and that the air gave no re&s;i&s;tance: but in nature this is not the ca&s;e; for all the&s;e are impediments which it is impo&s;&s;ible wholly to overcome. As we have e&s;tabli&s;hed the theory how|ever, it will now be ea&s;y to con&s;ider the nature of the&s;e re&s;i&s;tances, how far they dimini&s;h motion, and to make an abate|ment in proportion, in the working of any machine, or in the colli&s;ion of one body again&s;t another.</P>
<P>HOWEVER plane and &s;mooth bodies may appear to our &s;ight, yet if we exa|mine their &s;urfaces through a micro|&s;cope,
<PB N="280" REF="300">
we &s;hall di&s;cover numberle&s;s inequalities. The&s;e inequalities are the cau&s;es of friction in two bodies, that move in contact with each other; the little ri&s;ings in one body &s;tick them&s;elves into the &s;mall cavities of the other, in the &s;ame manner as the hairs of a bru&s;h run into the inequalities of the coat, while it is bru&s;hing. If the bodies &s;lide one over the other, the little ri&s;ings in one body in &s;ome mea&s;ure tear, or are torn by the oppo&s;ite depre&s;&s;ions into which they had been driven, &s;o that &s;liding bodies move with difficulty. If, on the contrary, they roll over each other, then the &s;mall ri&s;ings fall perpendicularly each into its &s;ocket, and are lifted out of it again, without any rupture in the &s;urface of either body what&s;oever.</P>
<P>IT is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to mea&s;ure preci&s;ely the quantity of motion that any two bodies will lo&s;e by thus rubbing one over the other, even though we knew that the workman had poli&s;hed both the

Thus for in&s;tance, &s;up|po&s;e I throw a &s;mooth cord over a fixed pulley, and hang a pound at one end of the cord; then if I have a mind to out-balance this, I hang a pound and a grain at the other end of the &s;ame; but though in theory, this pound and grain would out-balance the other, yet in fact it will not; it will not &s;tir the former, becau&s;e the friction of the cord is yet to be overcome. If I then a&s;k what is the preci&s;e additional weight requi&s;ite for overcoming this friction, all the an&s;wer a philo&s;opher can make is, that he has no general rule for this, and that he cannot tell what weight will &s;uffice, till he tries the particular ca&s;e.

<P>WITH regard to the &s;moothne&s;s of the two rubbing bodies, it is very evident that the &s;moother they are, the le&s;s will be the friction, and for this rea&s;on; in all machines where there is much friction of the parts, &s;uch as in the nave of a wheel, in the axle of a pulley, and &s;uch like, they are grea&s;ed with oil to fill up the cavities and ri&s;ings, and thus to facilitate their &s;liding with ea&s;e, &s;urface over &s;urface.</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="305">TO bring our conjectures nearer to certainty, in mea&s;uring the quantity of motion lo&s;t by friction, we mu&s;t next con&s;ider the &s;wiftne&s;s with which the two &s;urfaces are rubbed together. <HI>Mu&s;|chenbrook</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that from &s;everal experiments he has made (though he does not tell us what tho&s;e experi|ments are) the friction increa&s;es in proportion to the &s;wiftne&s;s with which the &s;urfaces glide over each other; <HI>Nolet</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion; they only differ in this, that the former thinks increa&s;ing the &s;wiftne&s;s to a great degree, will &s;till increa&s;e the friction the more; the latter &s;uppo&s;es, that the friction hath its bounds, and after the &s;ur|faces come to a certain degree of &s;wiftne&s;s, though their velocity be then increa&s;ed never &s;o much, yet there will be no increa&s;e of friction.

have a&s;&s;erted. He would &s;ay, that if his wheels were well grea&s;ed, the &s;wifter they went, the ea&s;ier they were upon the hor&s;e, and the le&s;s would be their friction: <HI>Euler</HI> of <HI>Berlin</HI> is of the very &s;ame opinion. In fact, let us compare the inequalities of one &s;urface going &s;wiftly over the depre&s;&s;ions of the other, to a chariot wheel, drawn violently over the inequalities of a &s;tony road; we have often &s;een that before it well could get to the bottom, in de&s;cending from the top of one &s;tone, it is drawn up to the top of another, &s;o that in fact, it had thus a le&s;s ob&s;tacle to encounter, than if drawn &s;lowly along; for thus it &s;carce had time to &s;ink between the two ob&s;ta|cles, with the whole force of its gravity. It is ju&s;t thus in the ca&s;e under con&s;ider|ation; the &s;wifter the &s;urfaces move, the more their mutual pre&s;&s;ure is dimi|ni&s;hed, and con&s;equently, the le&s;s deep will the inequalities of one &s;urface in&s;ert them&s;elves into the depre&s;&s;ions in the other. The truth of this theory <HI>Euler</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="307">
has confirmed by experiment, as may be &s;een in the Memoirs of the <HI>Berlin</HI> Aca|demy for the year 1748, that upon the whole, the &s;wiftne&s;s rather dimini&s;hes than increa&s;es friction.</P>
<P>LASTLY, in e&s;timating how much a machine is retarded in its workings by friction, we are to con&s;ider the largene&s;s of the two &s;urfaces that rub each other; and to fir&s;t thoughts it would &s;eem, that as the inequalities of the &s;urfaces are the principal cau&s;e of friction, if we aug|mented the extent of the&s;e inequalities, we &s;hould al&s;o augment the friction; &s;o that if the &s;urfaces were doubled, the friction would be doubled in the &s;ame manner; if the &s;urfaces were made three times as great, the friction would be made three times as great al&s;o. How|ever, this is by no means the ca&s;e, the increa&s;e of friction bears no degree of equality to the increa&s;e of the &s;urface; &s;o that I may often make the &s;urfaces ten times as large, and yet the friction &s;hall

not for all this become four times as great. <HI>De&s;aguliers</HI> and <HI>Amontons</HI> are of opinion, that we may increa&s;e the &s;ur|faces to what degree we plea&s;e, and yet their friction would &s;till remain the &s;ame. For, &s;aid they, to make the inequalities of a large &s;urface, &s;ink into the depre&s;|&s;ions of the oppo&s;ite &s;urface, will require a force of pre&s;&s;ure, in proportion to the number of the inequalities. The number of inequalities is greate&s;t in the large&s;t &s;urface, and therefore, if the pre&s;&s;ure in the large &s;urface, be no greater than in a &s;mall &s;urface, the inequalities of the large &s;urface will be pre&s;&s;ed in with le&s;s force, and &s;o not &s;ink &s;o deep as they will in the &s;mall. In two bodies there|fore, pre&s;&s;ing each other in large &s;urfaces, though the pre&s;&s;ure is more diffu&s;ed, yet it is not &s;o deep; and con&s;equently, con|tinue they, the re&s;i&s;tance they give to each other's motion will not be increa&s;ed by merely increa&s;ing the &s;urface only. This theory, as we may ea&s;ily conceive, would have but few partizans, if it were un&s;up|ported
<PB N="289" REF="309">
by experiments. Feeble experi|ments were produced, to &s;upport a feeble theory; but both gained &s;trength when united, and convinced many, whom either, &s;ingly, could not per&s;uade. <HI>Mu&s;chenbrook</HI> was the fir&s;t who oppo&s;ed this erroneous theory, and that with an experiment that was inconte&s;tible. He a&s;&s;erted, that by increa&s;ing the &s;urfaces of two bodies &s;liding over each other, the friction was al&s;o increa&s;ed. For, continued he, if we take two &s;mall pieces of a deal board &s;moothed and poli&s;hed, one piece a foot long and an inch broad, the other a foot long and two inches broad, and if we lay the &s;ame loads upon both, taking into con&s;ideration the weight of the boards them&s;elves, the large&s;t, he a&s;&s;ures us, will be always found to move with greate&s;t difficulty; a proof of its receiving greater ob&s;tacles from friction. Thus it appears, that increa&s;ing the &s;urface will increa&s;e the friction, how|ever in no very con&s;iderable degree; for it often happens that the friction is not
<PB N="290" REF="310">
thus increa&s;ed a fifth part greater, when the &s;urface becomes twice as great.</P>
<P>IN a word therefore, in e&s;timating the be&s;t manner of dimini&s;hing the friction in any machine, if we &s;uppo&s;e all the parts &s;mooth and well oiled, it will be found, that the le&s;s the pre&s;&s;ure is upon the rubbing &s;urfaces, or in other words, the le&s;s the load lies upon the parts that move, the le&s;s will the force of the machine be retarded by friction; the le&s;s exten&s;ive the rubbing &s;urfaces are, the le&s;s al&s;o will be the friction. But then this con&s;ideration of the &s;urfaces, is by no means equal to that of the pre&s;&s;ure: for if we double the pre&s;&s;ure, we &s;hall go near to double the friction; on the other hand, if we double the &s;urface, this will give but a very incon&s;iderable addition to the friction, &s;o that we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that a doubled pre&s;&s;ure pro|duces more friction than a doubled &s;ur|face. La&s;tly, the &s;wifter the bodies move over each other, the le&s;s will they
<PB N="291" REF="311">
rub, and therefore friction will be more dimini&s;hed in a machine that goes fa&s;t, than in one that moves &s;low.</P>
<P>FRICTION is to be taken into con&s;ider|ation in the working of every one of the mechanic powers, and as it is incom|modious in &s;ome, &s;o it is beneficial and convenient in others; the lever, the pulley, and the axle in the wheel, are retarded by this; while, on the contrary, our operations by the wedge and &s;crew, would be impo&s;&s;ible to be performed without it. For in the wedge, when it is driven into the cleft by the force of the hammer, if it were not kept in the cleft by the power of friction, it would be driven back again by the re&s;i&s;ting power of the timber. In the &s;crew, when we had pre&s;&s;ed down a re&s;i&s;ting body, by the exce&s;s of power we had over it, this body, upon our pre&s;&s;ure being removed, were it not for the force of friction, would drive the &s;crew back again, and we &s;hould &s;ee the &s;crew

turning up again, with much greater velocity than that with which it was forced down.</P>
<P>THE theory of friction, if perfectly under&s;tood, would be of infinite &s;ervice to &s;ociety; for then we might calculate with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, the force with which any machine would move, and the number of hands it would re|quire to work it. Be&s;ides this, geome|tricians might make their calculations on &s;everal mathematical problems with greater preci&s;ion, as in Brachy&s;to|chrones, I&s;ochrones, and &s;uch like; this would be a great plea&s;ure to them, though of little advantage to &s;ociety. Some of our own countrymen have taken pains, to a&s;certain how much friction &s;ome woods have more than other woods, and &s;ome metals more than others. The friction is found to be greater between &s;mall deal boards, than oak; it is much greater between plates of lead, than plates of bra&s;s.

explanation. "The principal re&s;i&s;tance which mo&s;t fluids give to bodies, ari&s;es from the inactivity of the parts of the fluids, and this depends upon the velo|city with which the body moves, on a double account. In the fir&s;t place, the quantity of the fluid moved out of the place by the moving body in any deter|minate &s;pace of time, is proportionable to the velocity with which the body moves; and in the next place, the velo|city, with which each particle of the fluid is moved, will al&s;o be proportional to the velocity of the body: therefore, &s;ince the re&s;i&s;tance which any body makes again&s;t being put into motion, is pro|portional both to the quantity of matter moved, and the velocity it is moved with; the re&s;i&s;tance which a fluid gives on this account, will be doubly increa&s;ed, with the increa&s;e of the velocity in the moving body; that is, the re&s;i&s;tance will be in a two-fold or duplicate pro|portion of the velocity wherewith the body moves through the fluid." That,
<PB N="298" REF="318">
as we &s;aid above, if the body moves twice as &s;wift, it will meet four times the re&s;i&s;tance. Such will be the ca&s;e of a body moving through a non-ela&s;|tic fluid; but the air is ela&s;tic (as we &s;hall &s;ee when we come to treat of its properties) and therefore it mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t in a different manner.
<Q REND="margQuotes">"If the ela&s;tic power of the fluid," continues <HI>Pem|berton,</HI>
 "were to be varied, &s;o as always thus doubly to re&s;i&s;t the velocity of the moving body, it is then &s;hewn (by <HI>Newton)</HI> that the re&s;i&s;tance derived from ela&s;ticity would increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion, in&s;omuch that the whole re&s;i&s;tance would be in that pro|portion, excepting only that &s;mall part which ari&s;es from the friction between the body and the parts of the fluid.

Upon the whole, as this is a &s;ubject that more particularly belongs to mathematicians, with them we &s;hall leave it; only ob|&s;erving, that by a train of rea&s;oning, <HI>Newton</HI> has proved that a globe moving through a fluid, &s;uch as air, that clo&s;es behind the body as it moves, &s;uffers but half the re&s;i&s;tance which a cylinder will do of equal diameter, if it moves endways; and in general, let the &s;hape of the bodies be ever &s;o different, yet if the &s;urfaces with which they cut the air be equal, the bodies will be equally re&s;i&s;ted. Thus, in the motion of an arrow, if the &s;urface, with which it cleaves the air end foremo&s;t, be as &s;mall
<PB N="300" REF="320">
as that with which a bullet cleaves the &s;ame, it will meet with no greater re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>WE have now &s;een, though ob&s;curely enough, that if a body moves twice as fa&s;t, it will meet nearly four times as much re&s;i&s;tance from the air, and that &s;ome &s;orts of &s;urfaces are more re&s;i&s;ted than others. But this difference of &s;urface however, cau&s;es but very little alteration in the air's re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that phy&s;ically, though not geometrically &s;peaking, we may &s;ay, that the greater the &s;urface of a body oppo&s;ed to the air, the greater will be the re&s;i&s;tance. A body which has twice the &s;urface of another, when moved along, will &s;trike twice as many columns of air in its way, and con&s;e|quently will meet with twice the re&s;i&s;t|ance. Bodies however that have a great deal of weight under a &s;mall &s;ur|face, will meet with a very trifling re&s;i&s;t|ance, compared to the force with which they move. For to make this very plain,

&s;uppo&s;e an hollow pa&s;te-board globe were &s;hot from the mouth of a cannon, the re&s;i&s;tance it would meet from the air, would be in proportion to its &s;urface, as we &s;aid before. But now &s;uppo&s;e it to be filled with an hundred leaden bullets, each as heavy as the globe it&s;elf, and &s;hot forward; the re&s;i&s;tance it would meet from the air, would be no greater than before; but there would be an hundred bullets within it, that met with no re&s;i&s;tance from the air what|&s;oever, therefore the whole of the globe would move forward with all its parts, an hundred times le&s;s re&s;i&s;ted than when it was hollow. Thus, though light and heavy bodies meet a re&s;i&s;tance great or little, as their &s;urfaces are large or &s;mall, yet the power that heavy bodies have of overcoming this re&s;i&s;tance, is much greater than that of the light.

<P><PB N="302" REF="322">FROM all this therefore it appears, that the &s;malle&s;t bodies having the greate&s;t &s;urfaces in proportion to their weights, are mo&s;t re&s;i&s;ted in their pro|gre&s;s through the air.

<P><PB N="303" REF="323">THUS far we have &s;peculated, as if the body to be moved was only in motion, and the air was quite &s;till and motionle&s;s. This however it &s;eldom is; we always perceive &s;ome wind, and there is almo&s;t ever enough to point the weather-cock. In this ca&s;e therefore, a body moving again&s;t the wind has a double re&s;i&s;tance to overcome, its own inertne&s;s to motion, and al&s;o the motion of the air. For this rea&s;on, the motion of the body will be retarded in proportion as both the&s;e re&s;i&s;tances are increa&s;ed: if a race-hor&s;e &s;hould carry his rider with as much rapi|dity again&s;t a &s;trong wind as he does in a calm, the jockey would not be able to endure its impul&s;e; but this he is unable to do.</P>
<P>FROM all that has been &s;aid of friction, and a fluid's re&s;i&s;tance, we &s;ee how vain it is to expect that a body will move for ever; &s;ince if we could &s;uppo&s;e an infinite force to put it into motion, we here &s;ee a re&s;i&s;tance continued infinitely

A pendulum, if its machine never required winding up, would in this &s;en&s;e be a perpetual motion; but &s;uch machines for pendulums have never been hitherto di&s;covered, and they might an&s;wer but few u&s;eful purpo&s;es upon the di&s;covery.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of Water.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG fluids, water &s;eems to claim the fir&s;t place; its proper|ties are more obvious than tho&s;e of air, for even the ignorant allow water to be a fluid &s;ub&s;tance, but few of them will grant air, which they do not &s;ee, to have any &s;ub&s;tance whatever. Its &s;ervices to mankind al&s;o give it the preference to other liquids, and are well known; but it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to declaim upon its u&s;es; let us as far as we can explain its nature.</P>
<P>HOWEVER fluid water may &s;eem, and unre&s;i&s;ting to the touch, yet few bodies can be found, the parts of which are more hard. If it be put into a globe of metal, and the hole be then &s;oldered up with care, no art, no power nor force on earth can pre&s;s it into a &s;maller compa&s;s than it occupied before. We
<PB N="306" REF="326">
can conden&s;e metals into a &s;maller compa&s;s, hard as they appear, but water cannot be conden&s;ed. If our attempts be pro&s;ecuted with violence, the metal, and not the water, will give way; for the fluid will drive through the pores of the globe, and &s;tand like dew upon its &s;urface.</P>
<P>NOR is the hardne&s;s of the parts of water le&s;s proved, by the pain it gives upon &s;triking its &s;urface pretty &s;martly with the palm of the hand. Many al&s;o who have leaped into water, from the battlements of high bridges, have been cruelly undeceived with regard to the unre&s;i&s;ting qualities of this fluid; the &s;hock the body &s;u&s;tains in this rude ex|periment, is inexpre&s;&s;ibly violent. But it is no way extraordinary that the body &s;hould feel pain in the conflict; for if a leaden bullet it&s;elf be di&s;charged from a gun, into the water, this &s;eemingly unre&s;i&s;ting fluid will actually flatten the ball.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="327">BUT whatever force water may have while its parts remain together, is nothing, if compared to the almo&s;t in|credible power with which its parts are endued, when they are reduced to vapour by heat. Tho&s;e &s;teams which we &s;ee ri&s;ing from the &s;urface of boiling water, and which to us appear &s;o feeble, yet, if properly conducted, acquire im|men&s;e force. In the &s;ame manner as gunpowder has but &s;mall effect, if &s;uf|fered to expand at large, &s;o the &s;team i&s;&s;uing from water is impotent, when it is permitted to evaporate into the air; but when confined in a narrow com|pa&s;s, as, for in&s;tance, when it ri&s;es in an iron tube &s;hut up on every &s;ide, it then exerts all the wonders of its &s;trength. <HI>Mu&s;chenbrook</HI> has proved by experiment, that the force of gunpowder is feeble, when compared to that of ri&s;ing &s;team. An hundred and forty pounds of gunpowder blew up a weight of thirty thou&s;and pounds; but on the other hand, an hundred and forty
<PB N="308" REF="328">
pounds of water, converted by heat into &s;team, lifted a weight of &s;eventy-&s;even thou&s;and pound, and would &s;till lift a much greater, if there were means of giving the &s;team greater heat with &s;afety; for the hotter the &s;team, the greater is its force.</P>
<P>UPON this principle of the irre&s;i&s;tible force in the &s;team of boiling water, one of the mo&s;t forceful and noble machines has been completed in our days, that ever appeared among the inventions of mechani&s;m. It is called the &s;team engine, a machine by which the force of &s;team is made to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of the united &s;trength of hundreds. The force of &s;team may thus be applied to the working of exce&s;&s;ively large machines, which would require a mo&s;t expen&s;ive &s;hare of bodily labour to manage. The &s;ame force may be applied to the rai&s;ing immen&s;e weights, to the fatigue of which, animal &s;trength would be un|equal; in &s;hort, wherever great force
<PB N="309" REF="329">
and per&s;everance are wanted, the&s;e en|gines can effectually lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The mo&s;t u&s;ual purpo&s;es however, to which the force of &s;team has been ap|plied, are in working pumps to clear the water from mines, or rai&s;ing it to proper heights for the &s;upply of cities. Philo&s;ophers were long acquainted with the great force of &s;team, and <HI>Papin</HI> actually contrived an in&s;trument, &s;ome|what re&s;embling the &s;team engine now in u&s;e, but in miniature. But yet this in|&s;trument of <HI>Papin</HI>'s contrivance, was only a &s;ubject of &s;peculation to the curious; though long before him the marquis of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> had a&s;&s;erted the u&s;es to which the force of &s;team might be converted, in a machine for rai&s;ing water. Still however neither the principle nor its utility were generally known, &s;o that the honour of the compleat di&s;covery and u&s;e of this machine, which is incon|te&s;tably the greate&s;t production of the pre&s;ent age, was re&s;erved for two ob|&s;cure but &s;en&s;ible citizens of plain under|&s;tanding,
<PB N="310" REF="330">
which is ever the be&s;t. Mr. <HI>Newcomen</HI> an ironmonger, and Mr. <HI>John Cowley</HI> a glazier, inhabitants of <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI> are the per&s;ons to whom we are indebted for this &s;urprizing engine, which has been of more &s;ervice to man|kind than the invention of algebra. The principle on which it is founded is only this: In&s;tead of working an enor|mous water pump with bodily labour, the &s;team may be &s;o applied as to drive up the arm of a pump rod, and the power of &s;uction will &s;erve to draw it down again; &s;o that the arm, thus alter|nately rai&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed, lifts the water in the pump, which flows out at top, at the rate of above three hundred and twenty hog&s;heads in an hour.</P>
<P>BUT to give the learner a &s;uperficial idea of this machine, let us imagine a common pump prepared, &s;uch as we every day &s;ee, and that we want to move the handle of this pump upward, by the force of &s;team only. In the fir&s;t place,
<PB N="311" REF="331">
let us &s;uppo&s;e matters may be contrived &s;o as that the handle, or &s;omething joining to it, may go into the barrel of a gun, or &s;ome &s;uch hollow tube, &s;et upright over a cauldron containing boiling water. Next let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;team may be let into the tube at plea|&s;ure, through the touch-hole; now as the fire begins to dilate the &s;team, a part of it will enter the tube at the touch-hole, and this will pre&s;s up the pump handle which fills the tube very exactly, and would drive it quite out at the mouth, but that by the time it gets near the mouth of the barrel, there is a contriv|ance by which a little cold water is &s;pouted into it, and this effectually de|&s;troys the &s;team at once; and thus it &s;inks to the bottom of the barrel and leaves it perfectly empty. The air there|fore without will now come into play, and pre&s;s down the handle again into the empty tube, into which no &s;team is permitted to enter, by a contrivance that &s;tops up the touch-hole below;
<PB N="312" REF="332">
but when the handle is thus pre&s;&s;ed down, the touch-hole below is again opened, and new &s;team entering again, pre&s;&s;es the handle upward; when the handle comes toward the top, the &s;team is again cooled and de&s;troyed as before, and the handle again is pre&s;&s;ed down by the external air; and thus it is alter|nately pre&s;&s;ed up and down, and works the pump with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>SUCH is the force of vapour, and a part of the u&s;e to which it may be ap|plied. But although the &s;tronger the fire, the greater the force of the vapour, and the greater its quantity al&s;o, yet no fire how fierce &s;oever can give water above a certain degree of heat; for as &s;oon as it boils, we may increa&s;e the fire in the mo&s;t vehement manner imaginable, yet the water will not get one whit hotter than before. The greate&s;t heat water is capable of receiving, being mea&s;ured by the themometer, ju&s;t amounts to two hundred and twelve degrees; at that pitch
<PB N="313" REF="333">
it begins to boil, and increa&s;ing the fire afterwards &s;erves to promote its evapo|ration, but not to increa&s;e its heat. However, though it becomes no hotter, yet its power of di&s;&s;olving the texture of &s;ub&s;tances thrown into it, is increa&s;ed by increa&s;ing the heat beneath; for by this means, the parts of the water &s;trike with more force upon the parts of the body, and thus &s;ooner de&s;troy their arrangement.</P>
<P>AS water begins to boil, it is u&s;ually &s;een to bubble; the le&s;s it is pre&s;&s;ed by the atmo&s;phere above, the more it bubbles, and in the void it bubbles very readily: if the &s;urface of boiling water be therefore covered with a fluid, which pre&s;&s;es like the atmo&s;phere upon it, the bubbling, or as it is u&s;ually called, the boiling over of the water will be thus prevented. The more tenacious or gluey any fluid is, the more in this manner it is apt to boil over; however, if any lighter fluid is thrown in which will
<PB N="314" REF="334">
pre&s;s down the bubbling &s;urface, and thus make an artificial atmo&s;phere, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, this will prevent the dangerous effects of the overflowing fluid. Boiling &s;ugar thus is apt to run over; but this is prevented by throwing in a piece of butter, or &s;ome &s;uch like &s;ub&s;tance, which &s;preading, floats upon the &s;urface, and keeps the other fluid from ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this ebullition in boiling water, the cau&s;e of the &s;urprizing force of its vapours when driven off by heat, the cau&s;e of the yielding fluidity of its parts; the&s;e are utterly unknown, and in this re&s;pect we mu&s;t be contented like geographers, to give the map of a coun|try, without knowing its real produc|tions. Some a&s;cribe the bubbles in boiling water to the air endeavouring to get free, and thus a&s;&s;uming a &s;phe|rical figure. Others a&s;cribe them to the parts of the water it&s;elf, reduced into thin plates by the interpo&s;ition of the
<PB N="315" REF="335">
parts of the fire. For the fir&s;t, waters purged of their air by former boiling, bubble as much as tho&s;e which have all their air &s;till remaining; as to the &s;econd, the den&s;e&s;t liquors bubble lea&s;t, &s;uch as mercury, yet the&s;e admit of a much greater proportion of fire be|tween their parts to reduce them to thin plates, than lighter fluids. The&s;e, and &s;everal other phaenomena of this fluid, are all equally inexplicable. Thus we know that water extingui&s;hes fire. Why? <HI>Mu&s;chenbrook</HI> will tell us, that the fire con&s;umes and feeds upon bodies, only becau&s;e they contain a quantity of oil: That this oil, when &s;et on fire, has an heat of &s;ix hundred degrees, that the greate&s;t heat of water is only two hun|dred and twelve degrees, &s;o that water mu&s;t cool the oil, and &s;o extingui&s;h the flame. This would be a very plau&s;ible &s;olution, did we not find that water often makes a fire burn with &s;till greater force, when thrown in &s;mall quantities upon it; &s;o that in &s;uch a ca&s;e, water, mixed
<PB N="316" REF="336">
with this imaginary oil, makes it burn fiercer.</P>
<P>WATER, like every other &s;ub&s;tance with which mankind are acquainted, is never found &s;imple and unmixed; though it be di&s;tilled never &s;o often, yet it will have an earthy &s;ediment at the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, in which the proce&s;s is performed. We have an account of the different &s;ub&s;tances with which it is u&s;ually mixed, in <HI>Boerhaave</HI>; but one more accurate &s;till, has lately been given us by <HI>Margraff,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> chymi&s;t. A hundred <HI>German</HI> mea&s;ures, or about fifty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> quarts of rain water, gave, upon di&s;tillation, an hundred grains of a yellowi&s;h white earth, a few grains of nitre, and &s;ome of common &s;alt. The greate&s;t care was taken to have the water pure and unpolluted, yet &s;till it exhibited this heterogeneous mixture. The&s;e &s;alts were evident demon&s;trations that the &s;ame water al&s;o contained oil, and there|fore if &s;o, it mu&s;t have been upon that
<PB N="317" REF="337">
account &s;ubject to putrefaction. For this purpo&s;e, <HI>Margraff</HI> expo&s;ed it for &s;ome time to the weather, and at about the end of one month, he perceived a kind of internal fermentation, and a greeni&s;h &s;ub&s;tance began to &s;tick to the bottom and &s;ides of the gla&s;s, re&s;embling the mantle of a &s;tanding pool; its &s;mell was di&s;agreeable, but it was near three months before it was perfectly putrefied; a proof that the oil it contained was in much le&s;s quantity, than in the gene|rality of other &s;ub&s;tances, which rot much &s;ooner. Snow water exhibited the very &s;ame appearances, but upon the di&s;tillation, rather furni&s;hed more earth, and le&s;s nitre; a pretty evident proof that nitre is not the cau&s;e of the congela|tion of water into &s;now, as &s;ome have imagined. In &s;hort, in this naturali&s;t's experiments, &s;now water &s;eemed equally foul with that of rain water; contrary to the experiments of <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> and many of our own countrymen, who have taught us to regard &s;now water as more pure than any other.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="338">SPRING water is generally pure or polluted, in proportion as the earth through which it happens to &s;tream, is impregnated with minerals or &s;alts, which it is capable of di&s;&s;olving. Tho&s;e waters which come through or over beds of &s;alt, or layers of ore, take a &s;trong tincture from either, from whence we have &s;paw waters of different kinds. Tho&s;e that are &s;trained through a &s;andy &s;oil, free from &s;aline or metallic &s;ub|&s;tances are much more pure.</P>
<P>RIVERS in general furni&s;h pure water in proportion to the purity of the foun|tains by which they are fed, or the nature of the &s;oil through which they flow. The large&s;t rivers have in general the mo&s;t unpolluted &s;treams; the <HI>Indus,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Thames,</HI> all produce the &s;ofte&s;t and pure&s;t waters, mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the di&s;tingui&s;hing palate, and lea&s;t liable to putrefaction.</P>
<P>AS water, when thus mixed with weighty &s;aline and metallic principles,
<PB N="319" REF="339">
mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily more heavy than when perfectly pure; &s;o in many ca&s;es, the weight of water will &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h its purity. The mo&s;t pure water will in general be the lighte&s;t; but we mu&s;t not depend upon this as a rule, for often a putre&s;cent oil is mixed in|timately with the fluid, particularly when it flows over fat and unctuous beds of earth; this in a &s;mall quantity mixes with its &s;ub&s;tance, dimini&s;hing its weight at the &s;ame time that it increa&s;es its tendency to putrefaction.</P>
<P>OF all kinds of water, that in &s;tagnant pools is the mo&s;t impure and noxious to the con&s;titution. Water &s;erves as a di&s;&s;olvent to almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;tance that is thrown into it; in this manner &s;alts, metals, plants, ordures of every kind, are all generally mixed together in the&s;e places, and make one ma&s;s of corruption, equally di&s;plea&s;ing to the &s;en&s;e, and in|jurious to the health.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="340">THIS water however, may be u&s;ed in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity: but there is &s;till a larger &s;tore of this fluid, which nature &s;eems not to have allotted for the u&s;e of man, I mean the &s;alt waters of the &s;ea. The&s;e, as we well know, contain &s;alt in very great quantities, together with a bitumen, perceivable both to our ta&s;te and &s;mell; the&s;e &s;alts being much heavier than water, and being di&s;&s;olved in it, give the contents of the ocean that &s;uperior &s;trength and weight which fre&s;h water cannot equal. Where fre&s;h water &s;upports a body of a thou&s;and pounds, &s;ea water will &s;upport, all other circum&s;tances the &s;ame, one of a thou|&s;and and thirty pounds.</P>
<P>HERE again new que&s;tions ari&s;e, for which philo&s;ophy has not yet found a &s;atisfactory &s;olution; Whence is it that the &s;ea water is charged with &s;altne&s;s, while that of rivers is mild, fre&s;h, and fit for human purpo&s;es? Some, in&s;tead of giving a cau&s;e for its &s;altne&s;s, have
<PB N="321" REF="341">
offered rea&s;ons to &s;hew that it is fit the &s;ea &s;hould be &s;alt. Wanting, &s;ay they, the motion which rivers have, it would be apt to putrefy by its natural &s;tagna|tion, but &s;alt pre&s;erves all &s;ub&s;tances from putrefaction, and therefore it pre|&s;erves the waters of the &s;ea al&s;o. This is fal&s;e: the &s;ea is prevented from &s;tag|nating by many cau&s;es, as for in&s;tance, the tempe&s;ts and tides give it continual motion; and when &s;ea water actually &s;tagnates, it putrefies like fre&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Halley</HI> rejecting &s;uch a pucrility, &s;ub|&s;titutes one of his own: he thinks that rivers wa&s;h down all this &s;alt from the earth into the ocean; and that at fir&s;t, the &s;ea water was as fre&s;h as that of the rivers them&s;elves. This is not true: the ocean is ten times as large as the earth; &s;alt makes a fortieth part of the ocean. If the earth &s;upplied this fortieth part, a fourth part of its &s;ub|&s;tance mu&s;t thus have been &s;olid &s;alt; but common earth does not furni&s;h a
<PB N="322" REF="342">
grain of &s;ea &s;alt from an hundred pounds of it. <HI>Buffon</HI> a&s;cribes the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea, to beds of &s;alt at the bottom of the ocean. An experiment is again&s;t him; &s;ea water is &s;alter at top than at bottom. We mu&s;t at la&s;t therefore be compelled to unite the&s;e two cau&s;es, and this will bring the matter &s;omething nearer to probability; let us then &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ea is &s;alt, from the rivers which continually bring in a &s;tore of this mineral with their waters, and from beds of &s;alt lying at the bottom of the ocean, which its waters are di&s;&s;olving and carrying away.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of Springs and Rivers.</HEAD>
<P>WERE water always at re&s;t, un|di&s;turbed either by the winds or other external pre&s;&s;ure, it would corrupt and putrefy. We have already taken notice of its putrefaction in the ve&s;&s;els of the chymi&s;t, who expo&s;ed it for that purpo&s;e, and the &s;ame thing con&s;tantly happens to tho&s;e who &s;tore up water for long voyages. It lo&s;es its tran&s;parence, generally becomes fir&s;t brown, then greeni&s;h, and at la&s;t turns red; in fact, it always putrefies: but the waters of different rivers have various appearances in each &s;tate of their putre|faction, each putrefying le&s;s offen&s;ively, in proportion as it furni&s;hes a fluid the lea&s;t polluted with heterogeneous mixtures.</P>
<P>THIS putrefaction is prevented in the natural &s;tate of things, by the motion of
<PB N="324" REF="344">
the fluid; for we &s;eldom &s;ee water running in &s;prings, rivers, or &s;eas, &s;uffer the&s;e changes. By con&s;tantly rolling onward, it is probable that the fluid &s;till pre&s;ents new &s;urfaces to the ambient air, and either imbibes a fre&s;h|ening principle from the atmo&s;phere, or depo&s;its its feculent parts upon air, which, like a &s;ponge, is fitted to attract them. However this be, certain it is that running &s;treams and rivers are more pure than &s;uch waters as &s;tagnate; &s;o that though we may be ignorant how motion thus contributes to the &s;weetne&s;s and tran&s;parence of water, yet we are certain that motion produces the&s;e happy effects. The manner how water fre&s;hens as it flows, may be hidden from human penetration; the con&s;equences of this motion are obvious to the &s;lighte&s;t &s;earch.</P>
<P>BUT now it becomes an enquiry equally intere&s;ting and curious, to in|ve&s;tigate how this &s;alutary motion in
<PB N="325" REF="345">
waters has been originally produced; how this circulation of the fluid, which we &s;ee carried round our globe, is con|tinued; from whence do &s;prings derive their &s;tores, to furni&s;h rivers with a con|&s;tant &s;upply; in what manner do rivers flow con&s;tantly towards the &s;ea; or how does the &s;ea it&s;elf daily &s;well and &s;ink in tide and ebb, with unremitted alter|nation?</P>
<P>TO begin with the fir&s;t natural agent in this exten&s;ive circulation, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the atmo&s;phere has a power of rai&s;ing waters up into it&s;elf in large quantities. We have &s;een capillary tubes lift water much above its level; we have &s;een a loaf of &s;ugar, wet at the bottom, &s;uck up the moi&s;ture to the very top. In this manner probably it is, that the bottom of the atmo&s;phere re&s;ting upon a large &s;urface of water, attracts it up into it&s;elf, and becomes loaded with the vapours of the &s;ubjacent fluid. This evaporation al&s;o is not a little forwarded
<PB N="326" REF="346">
by the beams either of the &s;un, or the heat which we know to be enclo&s;ed within the bo&s;om of the earth; the&s;e dilate and increa&s;e the &s;urface of the fluid, and con&s;equently promote its a&s;cent. Winds al&s;o in the &s;ame manner promote this evaporation; they rai&s;e the water into waves, and we need not be taught, that the &s;urface of a pond when uneven and wavy is greater than when it is perfectly &s;mooth. All the&s;e cau&s;es therefore concurring, water is rai&s;ed in great quantities into the air. If then we &s;uppo&s;e this body of water continually rai&s;ed and ri&s;ing in the atmo&s;phere, and again falling upon earth; if we &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e immen&s;e &s;tores of fluid, &s;ucked up from the ocean, to be conden&s;ed into rain, &s;nows, and dews, and to depo&s;ite their &s;tores upon land, here will be a fund &s;ufficient, for the production of &s;prings, and rivers.</P>
<P>LET us now then carry our imagina|tion to the cour&s;e which a body of

the&s;e vapours may be &s;uppo&s;ed to take in the air. A &s;heet of vapour ri&s;ing from the &s;ea, and wafted by the winds to land, is carried over the low grounds with an even flight, till it da&s;hes again&s;t the &s;ides of mountains, or is lifted up by the ri&s;ing air to their tops.

<P>BUT perhaps it may be thought that evaporation alone, is a cau&s;e too &s;light and in&s;ufficient to produce tho&s;e im|men&s;e torrents of water, which we have ju&s;t enumerated. To this Doctor <HI>Halley</HI> replies, (for the pre&s;ent theory is taken from him) that the quantity of water rai&s;ed by evaporation, is more than &s;uffi|cient to effect all the&s;e purpo&s;es. He has attempted to prove, by evaporating a determined quantity of water, with the natural heat it generally &s;u&s;tains, that every ten inches &s;quare of water, lo&s;es one inch in a day, by evaporation; and therefore, knowing the number of &s;quare miles in the &s;urface of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="349">
&s;ea, he calculated that it would lo&s;e by evaporation, every &s;ummer day, fifty|two thou&s;and and eighty millions of tons. This quantity he &s;uppo&s;es to be two thirds more than it gains, by the nine great rivers which flow into it. The water of its evaporation alone, would be therefore &s;ufficient to fill three times as many rivers as empty them|&s;elves there; and what is true of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> may be applied with equal force to every other great re&s;ervoir of waters. What they gain by rivers, is not equal to half of what they lo&s;e by evaporation; however, if the ocean fur|ni&s;hes in this manner more than enough, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to fall back in rains upon its own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>IT would he in &s;ome mea&s;ure unkind to di&s;enchant the beauties of the pro&s;pect which this theory pre&s;ents us. A romantic imagination can form nothing more &s;trik|ing than this uncea&s;ing rotation of waters; clouds ri&s;e from the ocean, travel till they da&s;h again&s;t the tops of the highe&s;t moun|tains,

de&s;cend feebly in little &s;treams down their &s;ides, enter the &s;ubterranean caverns of the earth, overflow, bur&s;t forth in &s;prings, and at length they all a&s;&s;emble into rivers, that carry the united torrent again to its parent ocean. Such &s;pecula|tions are amu&s;ing; but as &s;peculations however may be driven too far, &s;o here &s;uch a quantity of evaporated water has been contrived in &s;upport of this theory, as would, if it fell, drown our earth, in&s;tead of refre&s;hing it. Almo&s;t every calculator &s;eems to admit, that near one third more water is rai&s;ed by evaporation, than falls in rain: now what becomes of the &s;urplus, which we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e not to fall, is no ea&s;y matter to deter|mine. In one part of this theory al&s;o, <HI>Halley</HI> a&s;&s;igns as a rea&s;on for the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI>'s con&s;tantly receiving a &s;trong current from the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean, that the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> lo&s;es &s;o much of its water every day by evaporation, and con&s;e|quently requires this &s;upply. But how can this be the cau&s;e of the current in

que&s;tion, &s;ince the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean lo&s;es as much water by evaporation, as the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> it&s;elf. The &s;ame influ|ence acts equally upon both, and &s;o will cau&s;e no difference on either.</P>
<P>WHEN numberle&s;s rivulets unite, they form a river, and in every country there &s;eems &s;ome region higher than the re&s;t, from whence its rivers &s;eem detached on every &s;ide to the &s;ea. <HI>Varenius</HI> the geo|grapher has made an a&s;&s;ertion that at fir&s;t &s;eems extremely improbable, when he gives it as his opinion, that all rivers were originally formed by human toil and indu&s;try; that at fir&s;t they might have been but &s;mall canals, but being widened by degrees by the current, they at length have &s;wolen into a <HI>Wolga</HI> or a <HI>Po.</HI> Wherever, continues this geogra|pher, we &s;ee a flood of water bur&s;t from the earth, the water forms no channel, makes no progre&s;s towards the &s;ea, but overflows the adjacent country; there forming a lake, which is either con|&s;tantly
<PB N="332" REF="352">
&s;upplied, or &s;oon dried up by evaporation; he al&s;o mentions &s;everal rivers that have had their channels evidently made by human labour. His ob&s;ervation is curious, though his rea&s;oning be fal&s;e; and indeed it is ex|traordinary, that though natural hi&s;tory informs us of many new lakes, that are naturally formed by the bur&s;t of waters, it can furni&s;h us with no accounts of rivers made in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>BUT leaving <HI>Varenius</HI> and his opi|nions, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it is mo&s;t probable rivers have originally formed their own channels. If the ground over which they flow be very &s;teep, the water mu&s;t acquire proportionable &s;wiftne&s;s; it mu&s;t thus level the grounds which nature has oppo&s;ed in their way, the water will by its weight &s;ink it&s;elf a bed; and wherever the &s;treams are directed with greate&s;t rapidity, there they will wear the earth mo&s;t, and become wide&s;t or deepe&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="353">WHEN a river has thus levelled it&s;elf a bed, it will then flow more horizon|tally along, and of con&s;equence will wear its channel more &s;lowly; by this means the bottom will at length be in a &s;tate of permanence; whatever it lo&s;es by the continual bru&s;hing of the water over it, it will gain by the &s;ediment the water naturally depo&s;ites wherever it flows. The &s;teepy de&s;cent of rivers, when they fir&s;t begin their cour&s;e, is generally very great, for it is this which gives them &s;trength to force a pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ea; as they flow onward, their de&s;cent is le&s;s precipitate, they go onward more gently, and their fall is u&s;ually very little as they approach the &s;ea. From hence we may conceive a general picture of the windings of a river. When the waters towards their &s;ource are rapid and head|long, they move directly forward in a &s;traight channel; but as their de&s;cent le&s;&s;ens, their windings increa&s;e; and ever, as they approach the &s;ea, a&s;&s;ume greater meanders. By this rule, Mr. <HI>Fabry,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="354">
when travelling through de&s;olate and uninhabited countries, was always en|abled to form a probable conjecture of his di&s;tance from the ocean; the fewer the &s;inuo&s;ities of the rivers, the farther was he removed from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE rapidity of a river's current ari&s;es from two cau&s;es, the declivity of its channel, and the quantity of its waters; therefore it &s;ometimes happens, that tho&s;e rivers which have the greate&s;t declivity, are not &s;o rapid as tho&s;e who&s;e declivity is much le&s;s, but who&s;e waters are more abundant. Thus the <HI>Rhone</HI> is by no means &s;o rapid as the <HI>Danube,</HI> and yet its channel is more &s;teepy; for they both ari&s;e from the &s;ame mountain, but the <HI>Rhone</HI> falls by a &s;horter, and con&s;equently a more preci|pitate cour&s;e into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>IT is not my de&s;ign to give in this place a geometrical theory of motion of water in rivers; that depends upon prin|ciples
<PB N="335" REF="355">
not yet explained; though in fact, there is nothing in the writers on this &s;ubject, upon which we can depend with certainty. Thus they ob&s;erve, that the bed of a river may be compared to an inclined plane, and the water as moving down it with an increa&s;ing velocity, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s will be at the river's mouth. But then, &s;ay they, in proportion as the velocity is increa&s;ed by the de&s;cent, it is retarded by attrition again&s;t the bottom and &s;ides of the canal, and this more than coun|terbalances the former celerity.</P>
<P>THOSE parts of the &s;tream that are mo&s;t in the middle are ever the &s;wifte&s;t, becau&s;e they receive the lea&s;t ob&s;truction from the bottom and &s;ides to their pro|gre&s;&s;ive motion. For this rea&s;on, the union of two rivers mu&s;t encrea&s;e their celerity, as it dimini&s;hes the number of ob&s;tacles which they would meet with if their cour&s;es were &s;eparate. This al&s;o will give the rea&s;on why great rivers with
<PB N="336" REF="356">
a &s;mall declivity, are yet more rapid than &s;mall rivers who&s;e declivity is very great. The waters of the former meet with le&s;s ob&s;truction, and go forward with all their communicated force, while tho&s;e of the latter continually &s;uffer delay from the &s;ides and bottom of their canals.</P>
<P>WHATEVER dimini&s;hes the channel of a river, increa&s;es the rapidity of the &s;tream; for the force which drives the water forward &s;till remains the &s;ame, and we all know that the &s;ame force impre&s;&s;ed upon any body, drives it for|ward with greater velocity, in proportion as the body is le&s;s. Thus we &s;ee waters going with great rapidity under the arches of a bridge, becau&s;e the channel is le&s;&s;ened through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>WE are not to acquie&s;ce in &s;uppo&s;itions of geometrical writers upon this &s;ubject, that the &s;urface of a river is quite even and plane from one bank to the other.
<PB N="337" REF="357">
On the contrary, upon a &s;udden inun|dation, or when the middle of the cur|rent is extremely rapid, the middle part ri&s;es above the other parts of the &s;ur|face, &s;ometimes, as it has been found by admea&s;urement, three feet, though in a &s;mall river. The &s;wiftne&s;s with which the middle of the current is driven, in &s;ome mea&s;ure de&s;troys its gravity, and thus it ri&s;es mo&s;t, where its pre&s;&s;ure from gravity is lea&s;t. When a river has a backward &s;tream, as in the ca&s;e of tides flowing up its channel, then the water is highe&s;t towards each bank, and lowe&s;t in the middle; in the former ca&s;e, the water of the river re&s;embled a ridge, in this it is hollowed like a furrow.</P>
<P>THE water at the &s;urface of a river, and that at its bottom, are often found to have very different rapidities: if for in&s;tance, we dam the &s;urface of a river, by a bridge of boats thrown acro&s;s it, while the rapidity above is thus dimi|ni&s;hed, the rapidity of the water running
<PB N="338" REF="358">
under the boats, is greatly increa&s;ed. Tho&s;e therefore who &s;wim in &s;treams, interrupted in this manner by boats or timber, &s;hould not tru&s;t to the &s;mooth appearance of the &s;urface, for very fre|quently, a &s;trong and a fatal current lurks beneath.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the overflowing of rivers, the inundation is generally greater near the &s;ource, than the mouth of the &s;tream; for wherever the force is greate&s;t, there will be the mo&s;t likelihood of the waters bur&s;ting their banks, or overflowing them. But we have before ob&s;erved, that the declivity of the &s;tream is greate&s;t towards the &s;ource, and con|&s;equently the force of the &s;tream again&s;t its banks, mu&s;t be greate&s;t there al&s;o.</P>
<P>THESE hints may &s;uffice upon this &s;ub|ject; but it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that general rules can give us any certain infor|mation; a hu&s;bandman who, conducted by geometry alone, &s;hould attempt to alter

the cour&s;e of a river, or &s;top its inunda|tions, would be &s;oon taught, that un|taught experience alone, was in this in&s;tance a much better in&s;tructor. In &s;hort, the natural hi&s;torian is a much better guide on this &s;ubject than the ma|thematician.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Of Tides.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the fortune of philo&s;ophy to &s;ucceed be&s;t in accounting for the greater operations of nature, while it is evidently feeble in the minute. In the &s;ame manner as we have a &s;atis|factory idea of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, we have but an ob&s;cure account of the changes wrought in our own at|mo&s;phere. Thus al&s;o, the theory of the flowing of a &s;pring is but uncertain; the theory of the tides of the ocean is nearly demon&s;trative.</P>
<P>AS rivers flow and &s;well, &s;o al&s;o does the &s;ea; like the&s;e it hath its currents, that agitate its waters, and pre&s;erve them from putrefaction. This great motion of the &s;ea is called its tides. The waters of the ocean have been ob&s;erved regularly from all antiquity, to &s;well twice in about four and twenty hours, and as
<PB N="341" REF="361">
often to &s;ub&s;ide again. This &s;welling of the &s;ea is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable upon &s;helving &s;hores, where the waters retire for near &s;ix hours, and leave them quite dry, but &s;oon return again and overflow the &s;ands; and thus the alternate ebb and flow is twice perceived, in the &s;pace of &s;omething more than four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>IT was an ob&s;ervation al&s;o, in the earlie&s;t ages of mankind, that this ebb and flow had a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with the moon, and that the &s;ea's motions &s;eemed to be guided by the moon's motions. They ob&s;erved, that whenever the moon came over our heads, one of the&s;e &s;wellings of the &s;ea was &s;een al&s;o. They remarked, that whenever it was either new or full moon, the tides were greate&s;t; and on the contrary, whenever the moon was between the new and the full, and &s;hewed us but half its face, that then the tides were lea&s;t. There are &s;ea&s;ons of the year
<PB N="342" REF="362">
when, as a&s;tronomy &s;hews, the moon is nearer the earth than at other times; they knew that at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons the tides ro&s;e highe&s;t in proportion. They remarked with equal &s;agacity, that the &s;un, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, joined his influ|ence to that of the moon; that when the &s;un and moon were on the &s;ame &s;ide of the heavens, then the tide ro&s;e on that &s;ide highe&s;t; on the contrary, when the&s;e two luminaries were on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, that the tides then obeying a divided influence, ro&s;e le&s;s high than before. The &s;un and moon, as a&s;tronomy &s;hews, are more near the earth in autumn and &s;pring than at other times, and therefore the tides obeying their influence, were &s;een to be greater at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons. All this was di&s;covered by the ancients, and <HI>Pliny</HI> has given us a chapter upon the in|fluence of the&s;e two luminaries upon the waters of the ocean.</P>
<P>BUT this was only an ob&s;cure con|ception of the&s;e wonderful appearances:
<PB N="343" REF="363">
they knew neither the cau&s;e of this &s;welling, nor the manner in which the waters obeyed the lunar influence. The moon came over their heads but once in twenty-four hours forty-nine minutes, whereas they &s;aw the tides actually ri&s;e twice in that &s;pace, &s;o that here they were perfectly at a lo&s;s, &s;ince the tides ro&s;e twice as often as the cau&s;e that pro|duced them. The thorough inve&s;tigation of the&s;e appearances, was left for the &s;agacity of <HI>Newton.</HI></P>
<P>WE have often laid it down that attrac|tion prevails throughout all nature; the earth attracts the moon, and the moon at|tracts the earth towards it&s;elf, each in pro|portion to the quantity of matter contain|ed in either. This being acknowledged, let us &s;ee what will happen, when the moon comes directly over any part of the ocean. We have allowed that this planet continually draws the whole earth in &s;ome mea&s;ure towards it; but it will particularly act upon the waters, which
<PB N="344" REF="364">
are more at liberty to obey its influence than the &s;olid parts of the earth; &s;o that the waters immediately underneath it, will be attracted up in a heap. Thus we may conceive that part of the ocean as one immen&s;e mountain, with its &s;ummit pointing towards the moon. But now let us &s;ee what will in the mean time be doing on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of our globe? We &s;aid that the waters on the &s;ide next the moon, will be more violently at|tracted, than any other part of the globe, becau&s;e they are neare&s;t the moon; then of con&s;equence, the waters on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide will be le&s;s attracted than any other part of the globe, becau&s;e they are farthe&s;t off from the moon. If they be but feebly attracted, they will be very light, as we know all bodies feebly at|tracted are; if they be very light they will ri&s;e, and all the neighbouring waters will flow to that place; in &s;hort, &s;well into an heap or mountain of waters, who&s;e &s;ummit points to the oppo&s;ite part of the heavens, as the &s;ummit on the
<PB N="345" REF="365">
other &s;ide pointed to the moon. Thus does the moon, in once going round the earth in twenty-four hours, produce two tides or &s;wells, and con&s;equently as many ebbs: one tide, when &s;he comes to the meridian, nearly over our heads; another tide, when &s;he is over the heads of our antipodes, on the other &s;ide of the globe. The&s;e tides mu&s;t flow from ea&s;t to we&s;t, for they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow the moon's motion, which is from ea&s;t to we&s;t. We readily &s;ee now, that this double power, acting conti|nually upon oppo&s;ite parts of the ocean, mu&s;t agitate its whole ma&s;s, and &s;pread the motion not only to the &s;hores of the &s;ea, but drive its waters a con&s;iderable way up the rivers al&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT all this time, we have made no mention of the &s;hare the &s;un has in the&s;e operations. Were this great luminary as near the earth as the moon is, without doubt its influence would be much greater than that of the moon; but this
<PB N="346" REF="366">
is not the ca&s;e; the &s;un is placed at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from us, and though its power over the waters of the ocean is very &s;en&s;ibly perceived, yet it is greatly inferior to that of the moon, which though &s;o much le&s;s, is &s;o much nearer. Whatever power the moon hath, the &s;un has a &s;imilar power, but in a &s;maller degree. If the power of both the moon and the &s;un con&s;pire in rai&s;ing the tides, they will then have their greate&s;t &s;well; if both act in &s;uch a manner as to le&s;&s;en each other's in|fluence, the tides will not then be &s;o high. Thus, for in&s;tance, when it is new moon, a&s;tronomy &s;hews us that the &s;un and moon are on the &s;ame &s;ide of the heavens; they will therefore attract the ocean with united force, and we &s;hall have high tides. If again it be full moon, the moon will draw the waters in one direction, the &s;un will draw them directly oppo&s;ite, and this we know is the &s;ame, as if they both drew the &s;ame way, &s;o that this al&s;o will make the tides
<PB N="347" REF="367">
ri&s;e high. But now if it be half moon, then the moon makes different tides from the &s;un, and the ocean obeying a double impul&s;e, &s;wells but in a &s;mall degree under either. To have a more thorough knowledge of this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand a&s;tronomy; we will only therefore &s;lightly ob&s;erve, that the tides arrive each day later by forty-nine minutes, becau&s;e a lunar day is &s;o much longer than a &s;olar day: and let us add, that the greate&s;t &s;well is not &s;een while the moon is directly in the meridian of the place, but about three hours after &s;he hath pa&s;t; in the &s;ame manner as we &s;ee the waves of a lake have their greate&s;t &s;well, a &s;hort time after the tempe&s;t is allayed. Again, when the moon ri&s;es directly over the earth's equator, the tides are equally high on both &s;ides of it; but as the moon declines towards either pole, the tides will ri&s;e on either &s;ide in proportion to her proximity. Towards the poles however the tides are much le&s;s than near the
<PB N="348" REF="368">
equator, for the moon acts upon the &s;eas of tho&s;e countries with more remote influence; and be&s;ides, the polar oceans being almo&s;t continually &s;tiffened into ice, they le&s;s readily obey the lunar impul&s;e.</P>
<P>WE &s;aid above, that the tides pur&s;ued the moon's motion to the we&s;t; for this rea&s;on therefore the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts will have high tides, before tho&s;e that lie more we&s;terly. This is the general law which prevails over all the globe; the navigation of &s;hips to the we&s;t, is much more &s;peedy than their return, for they thus in a manner go with the tide.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t not expect to find this law prevailing in narrow &s;eas, clogged with i&s;lands, or altered by contrary currents. The tides are variou&s;ly affected in their pa&s;&s;age through different &s;hoals and channels, and retarded by winding round capes and promontories, that jut out into the ocean. Thus the tide in
<PB N="349" REF="369">
the <HI>German</HI> ocean, takes twelve hours to come to <HI>London</HI> bridge, where it ar|rives ju&s;t as a new tide is rai&s;ed in the ocean; &s;o that we have the highe&s;t tides up the river <HI>Thames,</HI> when the moon makes them lea&s;t out at &s;ea: for when &s;he ri&s;es above the horizon, our tides are lea&s;t, when in the open ocean they are greate&s;t. In &s;hort, if this general theory be well under&s;tood, there are few particular ca&s;es that will not find an ea&s;y &s;olution. Thus, if it be demanded why the <HI>Ca&s;pian, Mediterranean,</HI> and <HI>Baltic</HI> &s;eas have &s;carce any tides, it is ea&s;y to reply, becau&s;e they have no con|&s;iderable communication with the ocean. The le&s;s exten&s;ive the &s;urface, the le&s;s will be the tides; their's is not the hun|dredth part of the ocean, and their tides will be therefore in proportion.</P>
<P>AS the moon's influence is &s;o &s;trong upon the watery fluid that covers the face of our globe, it mu&s;t have al&s;o an equal power over the aerial fluid
<PB N="350" REF="370">
that &s;urrounds it, and will con&s;equently produce tides in the air. Many have thus accounted for the trade winds, that blow continually in the &s;ame direction with the ocean, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. But as the air is attracted only in proportion to its quantity of matter, and as that is but very &s;mall in proportion to the &s;pace it occupies, the&s;e aerial tides mu&s;t be imperceptible to &s;en&s;e, and they can produce no alte|ration here below.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS have not been con|tent with thus accounting for the tides upon earth, but they have given al&s;o a theory of the tides in the moon. If the moon, &s;ay they, can rai&s;e water ten feet upon earth, the earth will rai&s;e water an hundred and ten feet upon the moon; but as the moon has always the &s;ame face turned to the earth, its waters, &s;ay they, will ever remain at the &s;ame height, and there|fore all the tides it perceives mu&s;t
<PB N="351" REF="371">
be occa&s;ioned by the &s;un. But no mat|ter for the tides in the moon; it is very well if they have &s;atisfactorily explained the tides upon earth.</P>

Thus, if we reduce water, by evaporation, to the &s;malle&s;t parts our &s;en&s;es can di&s;tingui&s;h, yet if we examine any of the&s;e with a mi|cro&s;cope, the little &s;pherical drop will be found as fluid as the water in the ve&s;&s;el from whence it aro&s;e; the minute drop hath its &s;maller parts, which give it fluidity; the&s;e parts can be &s;eparated from each other, and thus made to e&s;cape micro&s;copic ob&s;ervation; but &s;till, where|ever
<PB N="353" REF="373">
water or its parts are &s;een, they are fluid.</P>
<P>AS we are ignorant therefore of the nature of the&s;e parts &s;eparately, becau&s;e we cannot &s;eparate them enough, we mu&s;t be contented to enquire into tho&s;e appearances which ari&s;e from their combination. Like all other bodies, we know they have weight, and therefore pre&s;s downward by the force of gravity. A gla&s;s filled with water, is heavier than an empty one; a &s;ponge floats while dry, but &s;inks when filled with water. We know al&s;o, that they yield to every pre&s;&s;ure, for each of the&s;e minute parts being capable of making only a very &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance, the combination of minute re&s;i&s;tances will appear like one uniform re&s;i&s;tance, oppo&s;ing, yet giving way to every impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM this accumulation, and this re&s;i&s;tance of the parts of any fluid, but particularly of water, many very &s;triking
<PB N="354" REF="374">
appearances ari&s;e. Their different force, in pre&s;&s;ing the bottom of a tall ve&s;&s;el and a &s;hallow one; their &s;upporting heavy bodies floating on their &s;urface; their ri&s;ing in one pipe to the &s;ame height from whence they de&s;cended, and thus a&s;cending up the &s;ide of an hill, contrary to their natural weight; the&s;e and &s;everal other phenomena attract our curio&s;ity, and demand explanation.</P>
<P>IN entering upon the fir&s;t part of this theory, which &s;hews how much the parts of fluids pre&s;s upon the bottom and &s;ides of ve&s;&s;els, or upon bodies which are plunged in them, we mu&s;t be contented to begin with one property, verified by experience alone; we mu&s;t &s;tart from an obvious appearance in all watery fluids, for which theory has been unable to account. The property of all waters is, that in a &s;tate of re&s;t their &s;urface is level.</P>
<P>NOW then let us &s;uppo&s;e three tubes or ve&s;&s;els united, and to have a com|munication
<PB N="355" REF="375">
with each other; (fig. 36.) we know that if water be poured into the perpendicular ve&s;&s;el A, it will run into the horizontal ve&s;&s;el C, and ri&s;e in the other perpendicular ve&s;&s;el B, to the &s;ame level at which it &s;tands in the ve&s;&s;el A.</P>
<P>FROM this obvious experiment we learn, that fluids pre&s;s in all direc|tions, upwards, &s;ideways, downward, and in &s;hort, every way. For let us &s;up|po&s;e that the tube B, were intirely taken away at <HI>b,</HI> it is evident that the water in the horizontal tube C, would &s;till pre&s;s again&s;t the part b, with as much force as it did before, whether the tube were there or not; and if the tube C were taken away, the water in A would pre&s;s again&s;t the part <HI>a,</HI> with as much force as it did, whether C were there or not; water therefore pre&s;&s;es the &s;ides and bottom of the ve&s;&s;el that contains it in all directions. Thus far experience alone mu&s;t be permitted to guide; and if we knew the figure of the parts of
<PB N="356" REF="376">
water, we might be able to tell how they come to be endued with this property; but as that is unknown to us, farther illu&s;trations would only increa&s;e the ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uppo&s;e water were made to &s;tand only at half the height <HI>d,</HI> in the tube A, it would then only ri&s;e to half the height <HI>e,</HI> in the tube B. The pre&s;|&s;ure therefore upwards at b, would then be but half as powerful as in the former ca&s;e, when the water ro&s;e to B; of con|&s;equence therefore, the pre&s;&s;ure at <HI>a</HI> would be but half of what it was before; and therefore the pre&s;&s;ure of the water in the ve&s;&s;el A, upon its bottom, would be but half of what it was before. From hence we may in general conclude, that the pre&s;&s;ure which water at any depth &s;u&s;tains will increa&s;e, as the height of the water above it increa&s;es. Thus, for in|&s;tance, if the ve&s;&s;el be very high, the pre&s;|&s;ure at the bottom will be &s;uch as would make water ri&s;e to an equal height in
<PB N="357" REF="377">
another ve&s;&s;el, and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be great.</P>
<P>FROM this la&s;t property we learn the cau&s;e why, if an hole opens in the bottom of a &s;hip at &s;ea, the water bur&s;ts through it with much greater violence than if an hole were broke in the &s;hip's &s;ide, near what the mariners call the water's edge. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the water being greatly pre&s;&s;ed by the weight of water over it having a free pa&s;&s;age into the &s;hip, pre&s;&s;es in with a force, equal to the pre&s;&s;ure it&s;elf &s;u&s;tains; on the other hand, the water in the latter ca&s;e is not much pre&s;&s;ed by the fluid above, as the hole is near the &s;urface, and it there|fore pre&s;&s;es in with much le&s;s violence.</P>
<P>ALL this is inconte&s;tible; but the hydro&s;tatic paradox we are now going to explain, will not be admitted &s;o readily, though undoubtedly true. It is this: <HI>The weight with which water pre&s;&s;es upon the bottom of any ve&s;&s;el which holds
<PB N="358" REF="378">
it, will be great in proportion to the height of the water in the ve&s;&s;el, and not to the quantity of water it contains.</HI> Thus, for in&s;tance, let there be two ve&s;&s;els A and B, both with their bottoms equally broad, and both equally high, but as we &s;ee of very different capacities; the bottom C of the &s;maller will be as much pre&s;&s;ed by the water, as the bottom C of the larger, though one of them may contain but a few quarts, and the other as many hog&s;heads.</P>
<P>WE will fir&s;t prove this from theory, and then &s;hew it true by experiment. Let us &s;uppo&s;e two tubes <HI>a b</HI> in&s;erted into the bottom of each ve&s;&s;el, the water will be pre&s;&s;ed into both with &s;uch a force as will make it ri&s;e to a level with the re&s;t of the water in both the ve&s;&s;els; but as the water is at equal heights in both ve&s;&s;els, the pre&s;&s;ure up the tubes mu&s;t be therefore equal. Now what is true of one tube, is equally true of a thou|&s;and, if they could all be in&s;erted into
<PB N="359" REF="379">
the bottom; therefore, univer&s;ally, the pre&s;&s;ure of the water in each ve&s;&s;el upon every part of the bottom, and upon the whole bottom, mu&s;t be equal.</P>
<P>IF two ve&s;&s;els of equal bottoms, but unequal capacities, as A and B, could have their bottoms &s;o contrived as to fall out upon a certain degree of pre&s;|&s;ure; if, for in&s;tance, the bottoms were of bra&s;s covered with leather, to make them water tight, and capable of falling off when water was poured in to a certain height; it would be con&s;tantly &s;een that the bra&s;&s;es would fall when the water ro&s;e to a &s;imilar height, in either ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t u&s;eful machines to &s;hew that a &s;mall quantity of water is capable of great pre&s;&s;ure, is the hydro&s;ta|tic bellows. This machine (fig. 37.) con|&s;i&s;ts of two thick oval boards, each about &s;ixteen inches broad, and eighteen inches long, united to each other by leather,
<PB N="360" REF="380">
like a pair of common bellows, or a barber's puff. Into the lower board a pipe B, three feet high is fixed at e. Now, in &s;hewing experiments with this &s;imple machine, which even the reader him&s;elf might ea&s;ily make, let water be poured into the pipe at its top c, which will run into the bellows, and &s;eparate the boards a little: then to &s;hew how much a little water will be able to effect by pre&s;&s;ure, let three weights, each of an hundred pounds, be laid upon the upper board. Now if we pour more water into the pipe, it will as before run into the bellows, and rai&s;e up the board with all the weights upon it. And though the water in the tube &s;hould weigh in all but a quarter of a pound, yet the pre&s;&s;ure of this &s;mall force upon the water below in the bellows, &s;hall &s;up|port the weights, which are three hun|dred pounds; nor will they have weight enough to make them de&s;cend, and conquer the weight of the water, by forcing it out of the mouth of the pipe.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="381">IT is inconceivable what force a &s;mall quantity of water &s;hall be made to exert, upon the bottom or &s;ides of a ve&s;&s;el, when it &s;tands in a high tube in&s;erted into the ve&s;&s;el. A &s;trong hog&s;head may by this means be &s;plit, and I have &s;een the experiment performed. Into the bunghole was in&s;erted a &s;trong, though &s;mall tube made of tin, and twenty feet high; when water was poured in through this, it filled the hog&s;head, and when it ro&s;e within about a foot of the top of the tube, the hog&s;head bur&s;t, and the water &s;cattered about with incredible force.</P>
<P>FROM hence we may &s;ee, that fluids will always ri&s;e to the &s;ame heights in pipes, from whence they de&s;cend. Thus, if there be a &s;pring upon the brow of one mountain, and &s;hould it be required to conduct its waters acro&s;s the valley, up the &s;ide of an oppo&s;ite mountain; nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to lay pipes of lead or hollowed timber along
<PB N="362" REF="382">
the &s;urface of the ground, leading from the &s;pring down one mountain &s;ide, along the valley, and ri&s;ing up by the other; this will conduct the waters to any heights, which do not exceed the height of the &s;pring from whence they are originally drawn. And the rea&s;on is obvious; all water will ri&s;e to its own level: we have &s;een it ri&s;e to the level, in the three &s;mall tubes A B C, and it would ri&s;e to the &s;ame, were the&s;e tubes each a mile in length, and equally high. But though in theory, water may be thus made to de&s;cend from the highe&s;t moun|tains, down the deepe&s;t vallies, and thus ri&s;e again on an oppo&s;ite mountain's &s;ide, yet in practice this can &s;carcely be per|formed from any very great heights, be|cau&s;e the pre&s;&s;ure of the water is &s;o very great in the pipes at the bottom of the valley, that no pipes can be contrived &s;trong enough to endure it. We have &s;een how the pre&s;&s;ure of twenty feet of water would bur&s;t a common hog&s;head: now if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the mountain
<PB N="363" REF="383">
four hundred feet high, we &s;hould find much difficulty to make any pipe &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t the water's weight at &s;uch an height. Pipes hollowed through rocks of marble, would in a &s;hort time bur&s;t, like tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ides were of paper. For this rea&s;on, when the height is more than an hundred feet, engineers, in&s;tead of pipes, are obliged to rai&s;e aque|ducts; the&s;e rai&s;ing the water more to a level, the force again&s;t the &s;ides of the tube is le&s;&s;ened, and it ri&s;es to the mode|rate height from whence it fell, without any injury to the pipe that conducts it. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that this con|trivance of carrying water down through vallies, and up again&s;t hills by pipes, was unknown among the ancients; but this is not the ca&s;e, as could ea&s;ily be &s;hewn: they u&s;ed aqueducts in their &s;tead, becau&s;e le&s;s &s;ubject to want repair, and furni&s;hing water in greater abundance.</P>
<P>BEFORE I quit this chapter, one thing more may be mentioned relative to the
<PB N="364" REF="384">
&s;urface of waters. It was &s;aid that they were always level when at re&s;t, but &s;trictly &s;peaking that is not the ca&s;e: the earth is round, as we well know, and a great &s;urface of waters therefore mu&s;t be of the &s;ame &s;hape, &s;o that in&s;tead of being a large plane, they will partake, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the earth's con|vexity. This convexity of the &s;urface of waters, though &s;carcely di&s;cernable in minute bodies of water, is di&s;tingui&s;hable enough at &s;ea. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;pec|tator upon &s;hore, and a &s;hip out at &s;ea, (fig. 38.) the fir&s;t part of the &s;hip that will appear to the &s;pectator's eye, will be the top ma&s;ts, for the intervening convexity of the &s;ea will prevent his &s;eeing the lower part; ju&s;t as if two men approached each other on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of an hill, their heads would be the fir&s;t part that would be &s;een by each other, for the convexity of the hill would intercept the re&s;t: as they would ap|proach however they would &s;ee more, until they both &s;tood totally vi&s;ible upon

the top. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with a &s;pectator and a &s;hip at &s;ea: in every nine miles di&s;tance, there is about &s;ix feet of the earth's &s;well between us and any object; &s;o that a man that &s;tood in a boat at that di&s;tance at &s;ea, would be totally un&s;een, though we took the be&s;t tele&s;cope to ob&s;erve him withal. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e however that this convexity, which is only vi&s;ible at &s;uch di&s;tances, can be &s;een upon the bo&s;om of a &s;mall lake or &s;heet of water; on the contrary, this may be regarded as perfectly plane, and all experiments are calculated upon that &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Of the Specific Gravity of Bodies.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN an un&s;pongy or &s;olid body &s;inks in a ve&s;&s;el of water, it removes a body of water equal to its own bulk, out of the place to which it de&s;cends. If, for in&s;tance, a copper ball is let drop into a gla&s;s of water, we well know that if it &s;inks, it will take up as much room as a globe of water equal to it&s;elf in &s;ize took up before.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that this watery globe removed by the ball were frozen into a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, and weighed in a &s;cale again&s;t the copper ball; now the copper ball being more in weight than the globe, it is evident that it will &s;ink its own &s;cale, and drive up the oppo&s;ite, as all heavier bodies do when weighed again&s;t lighter; if, on the contrary, the copper ball be lighter than the water globe, the ball will ri&s;e.
<PB N="367" REF="388">
Once more then let us &s;uppo&s;e the cop|per ball going to be immer&s;ed in water, and that in order to de&s;cend, it mu&s;t di&s;place a globe of water equal to it&s;elf in bulk. If the copper ball be heavier than the globe, its pre&s;&s;ure will overcome the other's re&s;i&s;tance, and it will &s;ink to the bottom; but if the watery globe be heavier, its pre&s;&s;ure upwards will be greater than that of the ball downward, and the ball will ri&s;e or &s;wim. In a word, in proportion as the ball is heavier than the &s;imilar bulk of water, it will de&s;cend with greater force; in proportion as it is lighter, it will be rai&s;ed more to the &s;urface.</P>
<P>FROM all this we may deduce one general rule, which will mea&s;ure the force with which any &s;olid body tends to &s;wim or &s;ink in water; namely, <HI>every body immer&s;ed in water, lo&s;es ju&s;t as much of its weight as equals the weight of an equal bulk of water.</HI> Thus, for in&s;tance, if the body be two ounces, and an equal
<PB N="368" REF="389">
bulk of water be one ounce, the body when plunged will &s;ink towards the bottom of the water with a weight of one ounce. If, on the contrary, the &s;olid body be but one ounce, and the weight of an equal bulk of water be two ounces, the &s;olid when plunged will remove but one ounce, that is, half as much water as is equal to its own bulk, &s;o that con|&s;equently it cannot de&s;cend; for to do that, it mu&s;t remove a quantity of water equal to its own bulk. Again, if the &s;olid be two ounces, and the equal bulk of water two ounces, the &s;olid, wherever it is plunged, will neither ri&s;e nor &s;ink, but remain &s;u&s;pended at any depth.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee the rea&s;on why &s;ome bodies &s;wim in water, and others &s;ink. Bodies of large bulk and little weight, like cork or feathers, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;wim, becau&s;e an equal bulk of water is heavier than they; bodies of little bulk but great weight, like lead or gold, mu&s;t &s;ink, becau&s;e they are heavier than an
<PB N="369" REF="390">
equal bulk of water. The bulk and the weight of any body con&s;idered together, is called its &s;pecific gravity, and the proportion of both in any body, is ea&s;ily found by water. A body of little bulk and great weight, readily &s;inks in water, and it is &s;aid to have great &s;pecific gra|vity; a body of great bulk and little weight, lo&s;es almo&s;t all its weight in wa|ter, and therefore is &s;aid to have but little &s;pecific gravity. A woolpack has actu|ally greater real gravity, or weighs more in air than a cannon ball; but for all that, a cannon ball may have more &s;pecific gravity, and weigh more than the wool|pack in water. Den&s;ity is a general term that means the &s;ame thing; &s;pecific gravi|ty is only a relative term, u&s;ed when &s;olids are weighed in fluids, or fluids in fluids.</P>
<P>BUT before we proceed in this theory, it may not be ami&s;s to get over an objection that will naturally ari&s;e. It may be &s;aid, that as in the de&s;cent of heavy bodies in fluids, the deeper they de&s;cend, the more they mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted;
<PB N="370" REF="391">
how comes it that by the time they get towards the bottom, they are not totally &s;topt from de&s;cending, and driven by the increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance upward? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y; the lower &s;urface of the de&s;cend|ing body is pre&s;t with encrea&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance upwards, it is true; but at the &s;ame time the upper &s;urface is pre&s;&s;ed with increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance downward. The&s;e two in|crea&s;ed and oppo&s;ite forces balance each other, and make no difference in the de&s;cent.</P>
<P>IF however a method were contrived, while the heavy body was de&s;cending, to take away the pre&s;&s;ure from above, and leave that below all its increa&s;ing force, then indeed the increa&s;ed pre&s;&s;ure from below, would actually prevail over the body's &s;uperior weight, and drive it upward; &s;o that by this means, lead or gold it&s;elf might be made to &s;wim upon water. The experiment has been conducted in the following manner. A gla&s;s tube C D, (fig. 39.) open at both ends, was fitted with a leaden bottom
<PB N="371" REF="392">
half an inch thick, which was held clo&s;e to the tube by pulling a &s;tring fixed in its middle, up through the tube, as &s;o the bottom could not thus fall off. In this manner the tube was immer&s;ed in water, in the gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el A B, to the depth of three inches only below the &s;urface of the water at K, by which means the leaden bottom was plunged &s;omewhat more than to eleven times its own thickne&s;s. At that depth the bottom, which had no pre&s;&s;ure of water above it, and had a &s;trong pre&s;&s;ure below, would not &s;ink nor fall from the tube, but actually &s;wam at that depth upon the water. If however, a pre&s;&s;ure above were made, by pouring a little water into the tube, then the lead would &s;ink with its u&s;ual velocity.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner as an heavy body was made to &s;wim on water, by taking away the upward pre&s;&s;ure, &s;o may a light body like wood, be made to remain &s;unk at the bottom, by depriving it of all
<PB N="372" REF="393">
pre&s;&s;ure from below; for if two equal pieces of wood be planed, &s;urface to &s;urface, &s;o that no water can get between them, and then one of them be cemented to the in&s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el's bottom, then the other being placed upon this, and while the ve&s;&s;el is filling, being kept down by a &s;tick, when the &s;tick is removed and the ve&s;&s;el full, the upper piece of wood will not ri&s;e from the lower one, but continue &s;unk under water, though it is actually much lighter than water; for as there is no re&s;i&s;tance to its under &s;urface to drive it upward, while its upper &s;urface is &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed down, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily remain at the bottom. The following method of making an extremely heavy body float upon water, is more elegant than the former. Take a long gla&s;s tube, open at both ends, &s;topping the lower end with a finger, pour in &s;ome quick&s;ilver at the other end, &s;o as to take up about half an inch in the tube below. Immer&s;e this tube, with the finger &s;till at the
<PB N="373" REF="394">
bottom, in a deep gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el filled with water; and when the lower end of the tube is about &s;even inches below the &s;urface, take away the finger from it, and then you will &s;ee the quick&s;ilver not &s;ink into the ve&s;&s;el, but remain &s;u&s;pended upon the tube, and floating, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, upon the water in the gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>AS every &s;olid &s;inks more readily in water, in proportion as its &s;pecific gravity is great, or as it contains greater weight under a &s;maller bulk, it will follow, that the &s;ame body may very often have different &s;pecific gravities, and that it will &s;ink at one time, and &s;wim at another. Thus a man, when he happens to fall alive into the water, &s;inks to the bottom; for the &s;pecific gravity of his body, is then greater than that of water: but if by being drowned he lies at the bottom for &s;ome days, his body &s;wells by putrefaction, which di&s;unites its parts; thus its &s;pecific gravity becomes
<PB N="374" REF="395">
le&s;s than that of water, and he floats upon the &s;urface.</P>
<P>THERE is a pretty childi&s;h contrivance by which the &s;pecific gravity of the body is &s;o altered, that it ri&s;es and &s;inks in water at our plea&s;ure. Let little images of men, about an inch high, of coloured gla&s;s, be be&s;poke at a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, and let them be made &s;o as to be hollow within, but &s;o as to have a &s;mall opening into this hollow, either at the &s;ole of the foot or el&s;ewhere. Let them be &s;et afloat in a clear gla&s;s phial of water, filled within about an inch of the mouth of the bottle; then let the bottle have its mouth clo&s;ed with a bladder, clo&s;ely tied round its neck, &s;o as to let no air e&s;cape one way or the other. The images them&s;elves are nearly of the &s;ame &s;pecific gravity with water, or rather a little more light, and con&s;equently float near the &s;urface. Now when we pre&s;s down the bladder, tied on at the top, into the mouth of the bottle, and thus pre&s;s the
<PB N="375" REF="396">
air upon the &s;urface of the water in the bottle; the water being pre&s;&s;ed will force into the hollow of the image through the little opening; thus the air within the image will be pre&s;&s;ed more clo&s;ely together, and being al&s;o more filled with water now than before, the image will become more heavy, and will con&s;e|quently de&s;cend to the bottom; but upon taking off the pre&s;&s;ure from above, the air within them will again drive out the water, and they will ri&s;e to the &s;ame heights as before. If the cavities in &s;ome of the images be greater than tho&s;e in others, they will ri&s;e and fall differently, which makes the experiment more amu&s;ing.</P>
<P>THIS is but an experiment of mere amu&s;ement; much more important u&s;es are the re&s;ult of our being able exactly to determine the &s;pecific gravities of bodies. We can, by weighing metals in water, di&s;cover their adulterations or mixtures, with greater exactne&s;s than by

<P>UPON this difference in the weight of bodies in open air and water, the hydro|&s;tatic

Fir&s;t, the weight of the body I want to try, is balanced again&s;t the parcel or weight E, in open air; (fig. 40.) then the body is &s;u&s;pended by the hook and hor&s;e hair at the bottom of the &s;cale, in water, which we well know will make it lighter, and de&s;troy the balance.

<P>AS we can thus di&s;cover the &s;pecific gravity of different &s;olids, by plunging
<PB N="380" REF="401">
them in the &s;ame fluid, &s;o we can di&s;|cover the &s;pecific gravity of different fluids, by plunging the &s;ame &s;olid body into them; for in proportion as the fluid is light, &s;o much will it dimini&s;h the weight of the body weighed in it. Thus we may know that &s;pirit of wine has le&s;s &s;pecific gravity than water, becau&s;e a &s;olid that will &s;wim in water, will &s;ink in &s;pirit; on the contrary, we may know that &s;pirit of nitre has greater &s;pecific gravity than water, becau&s;e a &s;olid that will &s;ink in water, will &s;wim upon the &s;pirit of nitre. Upon this principle is made that &s;imple in&s;trument, called an Hydrometer, which &s;erves to mea&s;ure the lightne&s;s or weight of different fluids. It is nothing more than an hollow copper ball, with a &s;hort &s;talk or &s;tem fitted into, or if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, growing out of the ball; this ball is &s;o made, as partly to &s;ink but not entirely in water, and &s;o poi&s;ed that the &s;tem &s;hall always &s;tand upright: the lower it &s;inks, the lighter the fluid; and on the
<PB N="381" REF="402">
contrary, the higher it &s;wims, the more heavy the fluid thus &s;upporting it. How much it &s;inks or &s;wims may be very exactly known by the &s;talk, which is graduated or marked; and this in&s;trument is often u&s;ed by tho&s;e, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to examine the different den&s;ities of liquors, &s;uch as drunkards, inn-keepers, di&s;tillers, and exci&s;emen.</P>
<P>THIS in&s;trument, I &s;ay, will &s;erve to mea&s;ure the &s;pecific gravities of different liquors, for it is found by experience, that liquors weigh very differently from each other; an experiment or two to &s;hew this will &s;uffice. Suppo&s;e we take a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el which is divided into two parts, communicating with each other by a &s;mall opening of a line and an half diameter. Let the lower part be filled up to the divi&s;ion with red wine, then let the upper part be filled with water. As the red wine is lighter than water, we &s;hall &s;ee it in a &s;hort time ri&s;ing like a &s;mall thread up through the water, and
<PB N="382" REF="403">
diffu&s;ing it&s;elf upon the &s;urface, till at length we &s;hall find the wine and water have changed their places; the water will be &s;een in the lower half, and the wine in the upper half of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner we may pour four different liquors, of different weights, into any gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el, and they &s;hall all &s;tand &s;eparate and unmixed with each other. Thus, I take mercury, oil of tartar, &s;pirit of wine, and &s;pirit of turpentine, &s;hake them together in a gla&s;s, let them &s;ettle a few minutes, and each &s;hall &s;tand in its proper place, mer|cury at the bottom, oil of tartar next, &s;pirit of wine, and then &s;pirit of tur|pentine above all. Thus we &s;ee liquors are of very different den&s;ities, and this difference it is that the hydrometer is adapted to compare. In general, all vinous &s;pirits are lighter than water, and the le&s;s they contain of water, the more light they are. The hydrometer therefore will inform us how far they
<PB N="383" REF="404">
are genuine, by &s;hewing us their light|ne&s;s; for in pure &s;pirit of wine it &s;inks le&s;s than in that which is mixed with a &s;mall quantity of water.</P>
<P>YET after all, we are not entirely to depend, and with geometrical certainty rely upon either the hydrometer or the hydro&s;tatic balance, for there are &s;ome natural inconveniences that di&s;turb the exactne&s;s, with which they di&s;cover the &s;pecific gravities of different bodies. Thus, if the weather be hotter at one time than another, all fluids will &s;well, and con&s;equently they will be lighter than when the weather is cold; the air it&s;elf is at one time heavier than at another, and will buoy up bodies weighed in it; they will therefore appear lighter, and will of con&s;equence &s;eem heavier in water. In &s;hort, there are many cau&s;es that would prevent us from making tables of the &s;pecific gravities of bodies, if rigorous exactne&s;s were only expected, for the individuals of every kind of
<PB N="384" REF="405">
&s;ub&s;tance differ from each other, gold from gold, and water from water. In &s;uch tables therefore, all that is expected is to come as near the exact weight as we can, and from an in&s;pection into &s;everal, we may make an average near the truth. Thus, <HI>Mu&s;chenbrook</HI>'s table makes the &s;pecific gravity of rain water, to be nearly eighteen times and an half le&s;s than that of a guinea; whereas our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tables make it to be but &s;even|teen times and an half nearly le&s;s than the &s;ame. But though there may be &s;ome minute variation in all our tables, yet they in general may &s;erve to conduct us with &s;ufficient accuracy.</P>
<P>IN general it may be ob&s;erved, that the pure&s;t gold is the heavie&s;t of all other &s;ub&s;tances what&s;oever, being nearly nineteen times and an half heavier than water; next to gold, is a &s;emi-metal of late di&s;covered, called Platina; this, if I remember right, is &s;ixteen times one third heavier than water; mercury is
<PB N="385" REF="406">
next in weight, and is a little more than fourteen times heavier than water; lead, eleven and about a quarter; fine &s;ilver, about eleven only; copper, is eight and three parts; &s;teel, &s;even and three parts; and thus of the re&s;t; diamond is about three times and an half heavier than water; gla&s;s, about three and a quarter; rectified &s;pirit of wine, is about one third lighter than water, and cork is more than four times as light.</P>
<P>NOW then, &s;uppo&s;e a body to be a mixture of gold and &s;ilver, and it is de&s;ired to know the quantities it contains of each; I fir&s;t find, by the hydro&s;tatic balance, the &s;pecific gravity of the compound. We know that its &s;pecific gravity is le&s;s than that of gold, but more than that of &s;ilver; let us &s;ubtract then the known &s;pecific gravity of &s;ilver, which we &s;aid was eleven, from the &s;pecific gravity of the compound, and let us &s;ubtract the compound it&s;elf from that of gold, which is nineteen;
<PB N="386" REF="407">
the fir&s;t remainder &s;hews the bulk of the gold in the compound, the other that of the &s;ilver: and as we know the bulk of each, and the &s;pecific gravities of each, we may ea&s;ily know their real weights or gravity, by multiplying the bulks by the &s;pecific gravities.</P>
<P>ALL expre&s;&s;ed oils, &s;uch as olive oil, rape oil, and the like, which are pre&s;&s;ed out of kernels or &s;eeds by means of heat, the&s;e and all fatty &s;uety &s;ub&s;tances, are about a tenth part lighter than water, and therefore &s;wim upon its &s;urface. From hence it is ea&s;y to conceive the rea&s;on, why animals that are fat &s;wim better than tho&s;e that are lean, &s;ince the former contains a quantity of oil within their &s;urface, which is &s;pecifically lighter than water, and con&s;equently keeps them buoyant. Thus the country people a&s;&s;ure us, that a fat hog &s;wims better than any other animal; and they have rea&s;on for their a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="408">OF all animals thrown into water, man is the mo&s;t helple&s;s. The brute crea|tion receive the art of &s;wimming from nature, while man can acquire it only by practice; the one e&s;capes without danger, the other &s;inks to the bottom. Some have a&s;&s;erted, that this ari&s;es from the different &s;en&s;ibilities each have of danger: the brute, unapprehen&s;ive of danger, and unterrified at its &s;ituation, &s;truggles through, while his very fears &s;ink the lord of the creation. But much better rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this impotency of man in water, when com|pared to other animals; and one is, that he has actually more &s;pecific gravity, or contains more matter within the &s;ame &s;urface, than any other animal what|&s;oever. The trunk of the body in other animals is large, and their extremities proportionably &s;mall; in man it is the rever&s;e, his extremities are very large, in proportion to his trunk: the &s;pecific weight of the extremities is proportion|ably greater than that of the trunk in
<PB N="388" REF="409">
all animals, and therefore man mu&s;t have the greate&s;t weight in water, &s;ince his extremities are large&s;t. Add to this, that in order to &s;wim, other animals have only to walk forward, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, upon the water; the motion they give their limbs in &s;wim|ming, is exactly the &s;ame with that they u&s;e upon land: but it is different with man, who makes u&s;e of tho&s;e limbs to help his motion upon water, which, upon land, he employs to very different purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>AS we have ob&s;erved above, that liquors of different den&s;ities &s;upport bo|dies in proportion to their den&s;ity; that the heavier the liquor, the heavier will be the weight it can &s;upport; it is not to be wondered at, that in &s;wimming, we &s;hould find our&s;elves much better buoyed up and &s;upported in &s;ea-water than in fre&s;h. For &s;ea-water is actually heavier, and this from the &s;alts mixed with it which increa&s;e its weight about a fiftieth part.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="410">IN order to facilitate our power of remaining on the &s;urface of water, or of breathing when at the bottom, different methods have been contrived. As to the fir&s;t, the cork wai&s;tcoat an&s;wers the pur|po&s;e tolerably well; for the latter, the di|ving bell is a well known &s;ecurity. Doctor <HI>Halley,</HI> in a diving bell of his own con|trivance, remained fifty two feet deep at the bottom of the &s;ea, for the &s;pace of an hour and an half.</P>
<P>THE diving bell is an in&s;trument long known and in u&s;e. That made by Doctor <HI>Halley,</HI> was in the form of a great bell, and was coated with lead, &s;o as to make it &s;ink in water: (fig. 41.) it was three feet wide at top, five feet wide at bottom, and eight feet high. Into this great bell the diver entered, and &s;ate upon a &s;mall &s;eat within-&s;ide, prepared for that purpo&s;e, and received light from a &s;trong gla&s;s at top. Thus prepared, by means of a rope, the bell, the man and all was let down to the
<PB N="390" REF="411">
bottom, in order to &s;earch for goods, or fix cords to wrecks of &s;hips, and &s;uch like purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN the bell is let down into the &s;ea, the water ri&s;es into it to a certain height, but it cannot fill the whole of the bell, for the air within it (as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter) will &s;till keep &s;ome room at top, and prevent the water's ri&s;ing and filling it any farther. It is in this topmo&s;t part, which is empty or only filled with air, that the diver keeps his head, and breathes that air which thus re&s;i&s;ts the a&s;cending water; here he can remain for &s;ome time, living upon the conden&s;ed air, and at the &s;ame time performing what he de&s;cended for.</P>
<P>BUT to be more particular in the de&s;cription of Doctor <HI>Halley</HI>'s bell. In the top was fixed, as mentioned above, a &s;trong clear gla&s;s to let in the light from above, and likewi&s;e a cock to
<PB N="391" REF="412">
let out the hot air, that had been polluted by repeated in&s;piration below. It was &s;u&s;pended from the ma&s;t of a &s;hip, and &s;o hoi&s;ted over the &s;hip's &s;ide as to be let down without danger. In this, two or more divers were let down to the bottom, and two barrels of air were let down to them, to &s;upply them with fre&s;h air, which alternately ro&s;e and fell like two buckets. As the air from the barrels was let into the &s;pace in the bell free from water, it entered cold, and ex|pelled the hot air which had been &s;poiled, out through the cock at the top. By this method air was communicated in &s;uch plenty, that the Doctor informs us, that he was one of five who were together at the bottom in ten fathom of water, for above an hour and an half at a time, without any &s;ort of ill con|&s;equence; and he might have continued there as long as he plea&s;ed, for any thing that appeared to the contrary. By the gla&s;s at the top of the bell, &s;o much light was tran&s;mitted when the &s;un
<PB N="392" REF="413">
&s;hone, and the &s;ea undi&s;turbed, that he could &s;ee perfectly well to read and write, or to find any thing that lay at the bottom; but in dark weather, and when the &s;ea was rough, he found it as dark as night at the bottom. But then this inconvenience might be remedied, by keeping a candle burning in the bell as long as he plea&s;ed; for he found by experience, that a candle polluted the air by burning, ju&s;t as a man would by re&s;piring, both requiring about the &s;ame quantity of fre&s;h air for their &s;upport, to the amount of nearly a gallon in a minute.</P>
<P>THIS machine was &s;o far improved, that one of the divers might be detached to the di&s;tance of eighty or an hundred yards, by a clo&s;e cap being put upon his head, with a gla&s;s in the fore part for him to &s;ee through, and a pipe to &s;upply him with air, communicating with the great bell; this pipe was flexible, coiled round his arm, and
<PB N="393" REF="414">
&s;erved him as a clue to find his way back to the bell again. The only in|convenience that <HI>Halley</HI> complained of was, that upon their fir&s;t de&s;cending, his companions and he found a &s;mall pain in their ears, as if the end of a quill were thru&s;t forcibly through into the aperture of the ear. One of the divers however, willing to remedy this inconvenience, &s;tuffed his ears with chewed paper, which, as the bell de|&s;cended, was &s;o forcibly pre&s;&s;ed into the cavities of the organ, that the &s;ur|geon could not extract the &s;tuffing with|out great difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Triedwald,</HI> a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> engineer, has made &s;ome improvements on this ma|chine, &s;ince <HI>Halley</HI>'s time. That contrived by him is le&s;s than <HI>Halley</HI>'s, and con|&s;equently more ea&s;ily managed; it is illuminated with three convex gla&s;&s;es in&s;tead of one. It has been found, that the nearer the diver's head is to the &s;urface of the water in the bell, the
<PB N="394" REF="415">
better he breathes, for the air at that place is mo&s;t comfortable and cool. In <HI>Triedwald</HI>'s bell, the diver's head is therefore nearer the water, and when there is a nece&s;&s;ity for his lifting up his head to the top of the bell, he has a flexible pipe in his mouth, with which he breathes only the air at the &s;urface of the water at the bottom of the bell.</P>
<P>WE are told of a much more u&s;eful method than either of the former, put in practice by a gentleman of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> He has contrived a large ca&s;e of &s;trong leather, perfectly water proof, which may hold about half an hog&s;head of air. This is &s;o contrived, that when he &s;huts him&s;elf up in this ca&s;e, he may walk at the bottom of the &s;ea, and go into any part of a wrecked ve&s;&s;el, and deliver out the goods. This method, we are told, he has practi&s;ed for many years, and has thus acquired a large fortune.</P>
<P>IN this manner we find, that no part of nature is wholly &s;ecluded from human
<PB N="395" REF="416">
vi&s;itation, &s;ince thus means have been contrived, to de&s;cend without danger to the bottom of the ocean, and to explore that aby&s;s which &s;eems, at fir&s;t view, to retire from curio&s;ity. Without the con|trivance above mentioned, men, when at &s;uch va&s;t depths below the &s;urface of the water, would feel the effects of its weight in a very &s;en&s;ible manner. Divers who go to the bottom without this ma|chinery, often return with &s;igns of the violent pre&s;&s;ure of the water upon the &s;urface of their bodies; their eyes are &s;een &s;wolen and blood-&s;hot, they often bleed at the mouth and no&s;e, and feel a total la&s;&s;itude over their whole bodies. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are mo&s;t violent, in &s;uch as fir&s;t undertake this kind of em|ployment; but they le&s;&s;en by degrees, &s;o that an accu&s;tomed diver feels no great inconvenience, by remaining &s;ome mi|nutes at the bottom: tho&s;e of this pro|fe&s;&s;ion, are only remarkable for the redne&s;s of the white of their eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="417">BEFORE I quit this &s;ubject, it may not be improper to mention a benefit that may accrue, from plunging or bathing in &s;ea water, not yet that I know taken notice of by others. Many arts have been tried to make &s;ea water fre&s;h and potable; the benefit of which would be, that in long voyages, when a &s;hip's company wanted fre&s;h water, they might make u&s;e of &s;ea water as a very ea&s;y &s;ub&s;titute, by fre&s;hening it according to art. The be&s;t method of fre&s;hening &s;alt water is, by mixing it with calcined bones, and then di&s;tilling it; for it is found that the calcined bones will lay hold on the &s;aline parts of the water, unite with them, and keep them at the bottom of the &s;till; while on the other hand, the fre&s;h fluid will ri&s;e in vapours to the top, and thus &s;eparate from the impure mixture below. There is but one objection that I know of, to the&s;e calcined bones and this &s;till, and that is, that they take up almo&s;t as much room in the &s;hip, as &s;o much fre&s;h water as
<PB N="397" REF="418">
they could make would do. If the Captain of a ve&s;&s;el therefore, is appre|hen&s;ive that they may want water in his voyage, in&s;tead of &s;o many hundred weight of calcined bones, he may take &s;o many &s;upernumerary hog&s;heads of fre&s;h water, and that will do as well. Com|mon water will be almo&s;t as conveniently carried, much more whole&s;ome, and in|finitely cheaper; for this rea&s;on we never &s;ee captains of &s;hips carry out calcined bones to &s;ea; for if danger is fore&s;een, they &s;upply them&s;elves with &s;uperfluous &s;tores of water. In unexpected calami|ties, perhaps the following method would for &s;ome time pre&s;erve life without fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>IF we are weighed upon going into a warm bath, we &s;hall find upon our returning out of it, that we have gained con&s;iderably from the fluid in which we have been plunged, being often increa&s;ed in weight &s;ome pounds; the rea&s;on is, that there are numerous
<PB N="398" REF="419">
ve&s;&s;els opening at the pores of the &s;kin, that &s;uck up the water like &s;o many ca|pillary tubes, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els run from every part of the &s;urface of the body into the inte&s;tines, and di&s;charge them|&s;elves there. The&s;e very fine &s;lender ve&s;&s;els are a modern di&s;covery, and &s;till conte&s;ted by different anatomi&s;ts, each claiming the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation of them to him&s;elf. We find al&s;o by experience, that though we be never &s;o thir&s;ty upon entering a warm bath, the bath in&s;tantly relieves that complaint, and we feel drought no more. What then, if in ca&s;es of extremity at &s;ea, a warm bath of &s;ea water were made, in which each of the &s;hip's company might bathe, and thus, by the pores of the &s;kin, drink in a &s;ufficient quantity of watery fluid to &s;u&s;tain nature, and to dilute their other aliments? We know by experience that they would thus imbibe fre&s;h water alone, for the pores of the &s;kin are too minute to let the &s;aline parts of water enter. The body, when plunged in a
<PB N="399" REF="420">
bath of &s;alt water, acts like a filter upon the fluid, and its pores &s;uffer nothing but the thinne&s;t and pure&s;t part to enter them; while the &s;alt &s;tands like hoar fro&s;t upon the &s;urface of the &s;kin, and may be wiped away with a towel. I do not care to drive an hint of this na|ture farther than it &s;hould go; nor is it to be wi&s;hed that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance this may afford, &s;hould induce men to be le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in providing the more ade|quate means of &s;ecurity.</P>

a knowledge of hydraulics will in&s;truct us in the cau&s;e of this diminution of its &s;trength; it will &s;hew preci&s;ely how far the liquor will &s;pout from any ve&s;&s;el, and how fa&s;t, or in what quantities it will flow. Upon the principle of this &s;cience, many machines worked by water are entirely con&s;tructed; &s;everal different engines u&s;ed in the mechanic arts; various kinds of mills, pumps and foun|tains are the re&s;ult of this theory, judi|ciou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P>AND what is thus demon&s;trated of the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, is equally true at every other depth what&s;oever. Let us then reduce this into a theorem. <HI>The velocity with which water &s;pouts out at an hole in the bottom or &s;ide of any ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever, is in proportion to the &s;quare root of the height of the water in the ve&s;&s;el:</HI> that is, in other words, If the water in one ve&s;&s;el be nine times higher than in another, it will &s;pout with three times as much velocity; if the ve&s;&s;el be
<PB N="402" REF="423">
four times as high as the water, it will &s;pout with twice the velocity. We need &s;carce ob&s;erve that the quantity of water &s;pouted, is always equal to the velocity with which it &s;pouts; &s;o that a ve&s;&s;el nine times as high as another, will &s;pout through a &s;imilar hole three times as much water, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, or a ve&s;&s;el four times higher, will &s;pout twice as much water. As an experi|mental proof of this, we may take two ve&s;&s;els, one five inches high, the other four times that height, and make a cir|cular orifice in the bottom of each, of the &s;ixth part of an inch diameter, and being both filled with water let them be &s;et a running, and let the water be &s;up|plied above as fa&s;t as it runs out below; the taller ve&s;&s;el will di&s;charge about two pounds of water avoirdupoi&s;e, in the &s;pace of a quarter of a minute; the ve&s;&s;el four times as &s;hort, will di&s;charge ju&s;t half that quantity.</P>
<P>AS the pre&s;&s;ure the bottom &s;u&s;tains, is &s;u&s;tained al&s;o by the &s;ides of a
<PB N="403" REF="424">
ve&s;&s;el in proportion to their height, water will flow from the &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el with the &s;ame force that it does down|ward; for it is found to flow out of both with the &s;ame velocity, provided they are at equal depths below the &s;urface; and therefore the velocity of water flow|ing out at an orifice in the &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el, is in the &s;ame proportion as before, that is, as the &s;quare root of the height of the water above the orifice, which a repetition of the former ex|periment may prove, by u&s;ing ve&s;&s;els with orifices at the &s;ides.</P>
<P>NOW as we are thus informed of the velocity with which water flows through an hole in the &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el, it may be requi&s;ite to know to what di&s;tance it will thus &s;pout &s;ideways. To know this, let us &s;uppo&s;e the water &s;pouting from the &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el, to move uniformly forward, with the ve|locity it has received, which is as the &s;quare root of the height of the ve&s;&s;el;
<PB N="404" REF="425">
now this velocity would drive it uni|formly forward, through a &s;pace equal to twice the height of the ve&s;&s;el; for we &s;hewed formerly, that a body having acquired a certain velocity by falling, would, if it moved uniformly forward with that velocity, go through double the &s;pace from whence it fell; and this is the ca&s;e with the &s;pout of water, which if nothing prevented would always &s;pout forward to double the di&s;tance of the height it &s;tands in the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>BUT now we know that gravity acts upon it, and draws it downward, &s;o that the &s;pout is impre&s;&s;ed by two forces that influence it, one forward, the other downward; the&s;e motions by no means de&s;troy each other, the &s;pout obeys both, and like all projected bodies it moves in the curve of a parabola. Let us then &s;uppo&s;e the water is let flow through an hole in the ve&s;&s;el B, at its top b; as it has no height of water there above it, it will not &s;pout at all, but drivel down the
<PB N="405" REF="426">
&s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el: let us, on the contrary, &s;uppo&s;e it to be let flow through an hole c, ju&s;t near the bottom on the ground; now &s;trictly &s;peaking, it will not &s;pout there neither, for as the &s;pout is always de&s;cending by its gravity, it will meet the ground the moment it leaves the orifice, and thus have no &s;pout at all. Thus at b, the water had no &s;pout for want of height to drive it; at c, the water hath no &s;pout for want of room to de&s;cend; it will therefore have the greate&s;t &s;pout at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the&s;e two de&s;troying extremes, and at a, it will go forward, as we &s;aid before, to twice as far as the water is high above it; and at all other heights or depths of the ve&s;&s;el the water will &s;pout in a &s;imilar proportion, and from all holes equally di&s;tant above and below the middle, the jets of water will be made to &s;imilar horizontal di&s;tances. I would only ob&s;erve here, that the u&s;ual method by which &s;ome determine the di&s;tance to which water will &s;pout by a &s;emi|circle, &amp;c. is erroneous.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="427">THUS we may univer&s;ally conclude, that water &s;pouts to double the di&s;tance of its height, provided it is rai&s;ed above the level of the ground &s;o as to take its full range. But though this is true in theory, yet we find in practice that there are great deviations from all the rules preceding; for we mu&s;t now ob&s;erve, that the water does not &s;pout in a com|pact parallel &s;tream from an hole in the ve&s;&s;el's &s;ide; for <HI>Newton</HI> has ju&s;tly ob&s;erv|ed, that the diameter of the &s;pout is large&s;t immediately i&s;&s;uing from the hole, that then it contracts its diameter as it pro|ceeds a little way, and la&s;tly, it &s;catters about in all directions; &s;o that we may compare the &s;pout to a cone, the ba&s;e of which is at the mouth of the hole, and the point at &s;ome di&s;tance from it. It is not the diameter of the hole therefore that &s;hould be mea&s;ured, to know the quantity of water that pours out in a certain time, but the diameter of this point or vein, at a little di&s;tance from the hole; and the admea&s;urement of this
<PB N="407" REF="428">
<HI>Bernouilli</HI> has actually attempted, but with what &s;ucce&s;s I will not pretend to determine; it may only be ob&s;erved, that the cau&s;e of this convergence in the &s;pout is &s;till in di&s;pute among the learned: the argument, from its intri|cacy, it is probable, will not be ea&s;ily adju&s;ted; however, let us not enlarge upon &s;o minute an enquiry, when there are &s;o many greater to engage our attention.</P>
<P>TO remedy this &s;cattering of the fluid as it i&s;&s;ues from the hole, we all know of the contrivance of the fo&s;&s;et or ajutage, which is only a pipe &s;tuck into the hole, that &s;erves to give the fluid a proper direction; this, while it an&s;wers the end propo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time dimini&s;hes both the velocity of the &s;pouting fluid, and the di&s;tance to which it would go. The length of the ajutage may be con&s;idered as a column of water of an equal height, re&s;i&s;ting the force of the fluid that &s;pouts through it; &s;o
<PB N="408" REF="429">
that if the ajutage be as long as the &s;pouting water is high, the two oppo&s;ite forces will thus de&s;troy each other, and there will be no &s;pout to any di&s;tance whatever.</P>
<P>THUS far as to water &s;pouting hori|zontally, or as we u&s;ually &s;ay &s;ideways from a ve&s;&s;el; now as to its &s;pouting directly upward, water will &s;pout up|ward with &s;uch a velocity as will carry it to the &s;ame height with the water in the ve&s;&s;el from whence it &s;pouts, becau&s;e the velocity it has at the bottom, is equal to the velocity it would acquire in falling down from the top of the water; and this velocity has force enough to carry it an equal &s;pace upward, as we formerly explained. The water there|fore will &s;pout in all fountains to nearly an equal height with the water in the ve&s;&s;els from whence it flows; I &s;ay nearly, becau&s;e, as we know, the air will give it &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and mu&s;t le&s;&s;en the force of all jets what&s;oever, and
<PB N="409" REF="430">
make them fall &s;hort of the height of the water in the re&s;ervoirs. But there is another cau&s;e that dimini&s;hes the height of the water's play; for when the water at the top of the &s;pout has lo&s;t all its motion, it re&s;ts for &s;ome time on the part below, and by its weight ob&s;tructs the motion of a new column i&s;&s;uing from below, and thus prevents it from ri&s;ing. The re&s;i&s;tance ari&s;ing from this cau&s;e is &s;o great, that the jet is frequently de&s;troyed by it; the ri&s;ing water being by fits and &s;tarts pre&s;&s;ed down to the very orifice from which it &s;pouts. But this inconvenience is remedied if we give the jet a little inclination, for then the uppermo&s;t parts, when they have lo&s;t all their motion upward, do not fall back as before, but are made to fall off from the re&s;t, and thus do not incumber the ri&s;ing fluid. From hence therefore we may under&s;tand the rea&s;on, why &s;uch jets as are a little inclined, ri&s;e higher than tho&s;e, who&s;e a&s;cents are perpen|dicular.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="431">IT is the difference in the figure of the ajutage, that gives a diver&s;ity of play to the fountain, and nothing can be more plea&s;ing to the eye than the different manner in which water is made to &s;pirt in the&s;e machines. But they give additional plea&s;ure in &s;ultry climates, &s;uch as <HI>Italy,</HI> where they contribute to cool the air as well as to enliven the pro&s;pect: with us they are chiefly made for the purpo&s;es of embelli&s;hment alone, for in our northern climate, the air is &s;eldom di&s;agreeable from too much warmth, and if there were fountains of fire, they would often make the mo&s;t grateful ornament. I only mean this as an hint, concerning the unnece&s;&s;ary expence which many are at to procure fountains, in a country where the cli|mate calls for different modes of embel|li&s;hment. Our groves and our fields are greener than in any other region in the world; to improve the beauty of the&s;e, our arti&s;ts &s;hould bend their chief efforts, and in this they will find nature con|&s;piring with their indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="432">WE have hitherto &s;poke only of the flowing of water from ve&s;&s;els and re&s;er|voirs that are open; we mu&s;t now ob|&s;erve, that from ve&s;&s;els clo&s;ely &s;hut it will not &s;pout at all. We all very well know that the liquor will not run from a clo&s;e ca&s;k, unle&s;s the air is let in from above; for this purpo&s;e, when a hog&s;|head of liquor is broached, there is always a vent hole made at top, which is occa&s;ionally opened when we want to draw liquor through the fo&s;&s;et or ajutage below. The cau&s;e why a fluid will not run from a clo&s;e ca&s;k without the admi&s;&s;ion of air, &s;hall be explained more largely when the properties of air come to be examined. Let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve here, that the air pre&s;&s;es with great force upon that part of the &s;urface of every fluid to which it has admi&s;&s;ion. If an hole is opened in the &s;ide of a ca&s;k that is quite full of liquor, the air pre&s;&s;es upon that hole with great violence, and prevents the liquor from coming out; if now another hole be opened at the top of
<PB N="412" REF="433">
the ca&s;k, the air will pre&s;s into this al&s;o with equal force, and pre&s;s the liquor out: the&s;e two forces balance each other, &s;o that the weight of the fluid, if I may &s;o &s;ay, turns the &s;cale, and it flows out. In general however, as our ca&s;ks are not filled quite full, there is a little air left at the top of the ve&s;&s;el; immediately therefore, when the &s;ide of the ca&s;k is pierced, this air pre&s;&s;es down, and there is a &s;pirt of the liquor, but as the liquor continues to flow it leaves more room at the top of the ca&s;k; and the air not being capable of filling this room as before, pre&s;&s;es with le&s;s force down, than the external air pre&s;&s;es at the mouth of the orifice up; &s;o that the fluid will no longer continue to flow, until more air is let in by a vent-hole at top, to balance that which pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the egre&s;s of the liquor at the hole below.</P>
<P>FROM hence we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of having a vent hole, or &s;ome contrivance of this kind, in all ca&s;ks that have liquors
<PB N="413" REF="434">
upon draught; and from hence al&s;o we may deduce a rea&s;on why liquors, that have been long upon draught, grow vapid or four; for the &s;pirits being light|e&s;t always float and mix with the air at the top of the ca&s;k, and every time the vent-hole is opened, we may per|ceive them fly out with &s;ome violence. Thus by frequently opening the vent-hole almo&s;t all the &s;pirit evaporates away at la&s;t, and leaves the liquor either vapid or &s;our. If this be true, might not a contrivance be made that would give a &s;ufficient pre&s;&s;ure to the upper &s;urface of the fluid, without permitting the &s;pirit to evaporate? What if a &s;mall tube were contrived, with a valve, which being in&s;erted at the top of the ca&s;k, we might force in as much air as we thought proper into the ca&s;k above, while at the &s;ame time none of the air or &s;pirit in the ca&s;k, would be permitted to come back through it or e&s;cape; this would at once give a &s;ufficient force to make the liquor flow, and would al&s;o confine
<PB N="414" REF="435">
the &s;pirit from evaporation. Whether this method has been already practi&s;ed I know not; it is here only offered as a conjecture, <HI>Valeat quantum valere pote&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the de&s;cription of &s;everal hy|draulic machines, &s;uch as the pump, the &s;yphon, the fire engine, and the intermitting fountain, we &s;hall re&s;erve the&s;e till we treat of air, which contri|butes &s;o much to their operations. Among the number of hydraulic ma|chines we mu&s;t not omit to mention the &s;crew of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> which rai&s;es water to &s;mall heights, and is at once the mo&s;t &s;imple and admirable of all the hy|draulic machines. It con&s;i&s;ts of a long round beam or cylinder, (fig. 42.) with an hollow pipe coiled round it like a cork&s;crew, and open at each end. This machine is fixed &s;lanting with one end in the water, and the other &s;upported in &s;uch a manner upon a prop, that turns by means of an handle, as we &s;ometimes &s;ee a &s;pit turned in the country.

as the lower end of the &s;crew gives a turn in the water, the fluid runs into the open mouth of the tube at A, and as the mouth of the tube ri&s;es, the water which it has &s;cooped up, &s;inks by its weight to that part of the tube on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cylinder, &s;o that now the mouth of the tube is highe&s;t, and the water in it is lowe&s;t, and cannot get out. In the mean time, as the mouth of the tube is &s;till in the water, while it is de&s;cending, the water it had &s;cooped in before cannot get back again, becau&s;e it has not force to overcome the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the re&s;t of the external fluid, which pre&s;&s;es again&s;t it as forcefully as its contents pre&s;s out; when it comes there|fore a &s;econd time to the bottom, and again begins to ri&s;e, it will take a new &s;coop of water, and the water it already contained being in its de&s;cending &s;tate, will &s;ink into the lower part of the &s;piral that is next to it, &s;o that it is prevented from returning by the pre&s;&s;ure behind, and &s;till falls, if I may &s;o &s;ay, forward

<P>THE human frame as well as that of all other animals, is u&s;ually repre|&s;ented as a mo&s;t compound hydraulic machine, with an infinite number of tubes, conveying their re&s;pective fluids from one part of the body to the other. In this &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els philo&s;ophers have &s;uppo&s;ed the various kinds indued with various powers; they have fancied &s;ome acting as pumps, others as capillary tubes, nor has there been wanting &s;uch as have made mention of the glandular &s;crew. The mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;emblance between the ve&s;&s;els of the human body and the&s;e artificial machines, have given men, who&s;e imaginations were &s;trong, frequent opportunities of completing the picture. This, in common conver&s;ation, is called ingenious error; yet &s;urely fal&s;e philo&s;ophy can have no ingenuity what&s;oever: for what is it that can make its rigid in&s;titutions plea&s;ing, but that
<PB N="417" REF="439">
we &s;uppo&s;e them true. Philo&s;ophy, that attempts to rectify the mind, is its phy&s;ic, not its food; and it is but a &s;mall honour to that phy&s;ician of whom it is &s;aid, that his pills are &s;weet but inefficacious.</P>
<P>IN this manner attempts have been made to determine the velocity with which the blood circulates through the body. Some of the&s;e &s;peculators have not even taken into con&s;ideration the flexibility of the canal, through which the animal fluids move, but have given us hydraulic theories, drawn from the &s;pouting of fluids through gla&s;s pipes. Nothing can be more erroneous than this, but if it were only a &s;peculative error it would be &s;carce worth combating; no|thing can be more dangerous too; and in fact, very dreadful practice has been recommended, in con&s;equence of the&s;e ill guided calculations. But though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that even the whole theory of fluids &s;pouting through flexi|ble
<PB N="418" REF="440">
and ela&s;tic tubes were known, (and it is not till of late that an ingenious modern has attempted the inve&s;tigation) yet we &s;hould be &s;till as far from under|&s;tanding the velocity of the circulating fluids of the human body as before. To treat this with any preci&s;ion, we mu&s;t fir&s;t know exactly to what degree a vein or an artery is capable of dilating, we mu&s;t know the figure of the ve&s;&s;els, their ela&s;ticity, their different openings into each other, the force and the di&s;po&s;ition of their valves, the degree of heat and tenacity of each fluid, and the force which drives them forward. If all the&s;e were known, where would the mathe|matician be found, that could unite &s;uch various elements into one calculation? Even to determine the force of fluids in flexible tubes, alone, almo&s;t exceeds geometrical &s;trength; what then mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in &s;uch a complication of component parts? Modern phy&s;ic has with great ju&s;tice exploded tho&s;e idle and dangerous algebraic dreams, con|ceived
