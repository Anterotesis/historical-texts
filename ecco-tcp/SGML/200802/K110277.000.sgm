<HEAD>THE LIFE OF EDWARD MOORE.</HEAD>
<P>OF the life of this ingenious writer few particulars are known, and none re&s;pecting his de&s;cent, birth, education, or death; at lea&s;t none which we have been able to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Mr. Moore was bred a linendraper, but whether from a &s;tronger attachment to the &s;tudy than the coun|ter, from a more ardent zeal in the pur&s;uit of fame than in the &s;earch after fortune, or whether from the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned by our Author him&s;elf in the Preface to the quarto edition of his works in 1756, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his marriage with the Mu&s;es, like mo&s;t other marriages into that noble family, was more from nece&s;&s;ity than inclination,"</Q> he quitted bu&s;ine&s;s to join the retinue of the&s;e ladies; and he certainly had a very happy and plea&s;ant talent in poetry. In his Trial of Selim the Per|&s;ian, which is a compliment to the fir&s;t and worthy Lord Lyttelton, he has &s;hewn him&s;elf a perfect ma&s;ter of the mo&s;t elegant kind of panegyrick, that which is couched under the appearance of accu&s;ation; and his
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Fables for the Female Sex, not only in the freedom and ea&s;e of the verfification, but al&s;o in the forciblene&s;s of the moral and poignancy of the &s;atire, approach nearer to the manner of Mr. Gay than any of the numerous imitations of that author which have been attempted &s;ince the publication of his Fables.</P>
<P>As a dramatick writer Mr. Moore has by no means met with the &s;ucce&s;s his pieces have merited, which are three in number, The Foundling and Gil Blas, comedies, and The Game&s;ter, a tragedy. The fir&s;t has been condemned for its &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;emblance to the celebrated comedy of The Con&s;cious Lovers; and The Game&s;ter met with a cold reception for no other apparent rea&s;on but becau&s;e it too nearly touched a favourite and fa&s;hionable vice<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Game&s;ter was al&s;o objected to as too pro&s;aick in the language, and too horrible in the cata&s;trophe, as ob&s;erved and apologized for by the Author in his Preface to The Game&s;ter, quarto edition of 1756.</NOTE>. Yet on the whole his plots are intere&s;ting, his characters well drawn, his &s;entiments delicate, and his language poetical and plea&s;ing; and what crowns all and more forcibly claims for his Writings publick notice, the greate&s;t purity pervades the whole, the obvious tendency of every piece being the promotion of morality and vir|tue; as is indeed ob&s;erved by the Author him&s;elf in the Preface already referred to, when &s;peaking of his
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
Writings in general; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Such as the Work now is I &s;ub|mit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many.&mdash;Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and <HI>tending to promote virtue.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Moore married a lady of the name of Hamil|ton, daughter to the Tabledecker to the Prince&s;&s;es: &s;he had a poetical turn, and has been &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed her hu&s;band in the writing of his plays. One &s;pe|cimen of her poetry was handed about before their marriage, and has &s;ince appeared in different collec|tions of &s;ongs. It was addre&s;&s;ed to a daughter of the famous Stephen Duck, and begins with the following &s;tanza:<Q><LG>
<L>Would you think it my Duck! for the fault I mu&s;t own,</L>
<L>Your Jenny at la&s;t is quite covetous grown;</L>
<L>Tho' millions if Fortune &s;hould lavi&s;hly pour</L>
<L>I &s;till &s;hould be wretched if I had not <HI>More.</HI></L>
</LG></Q> After half-a-dozen other &s;tanzas, in which with great ingenuity and delicacy, and yet in a manner that ex|pre&s;&s;es a &s;incere affection, &s;he has quibbled on our Au|thor's name, &s;he concludes with the following lines:<Q><L>You will wonder my Girl! who this dear one can be</L>
<L>Who&s;e merit can boa&s;t &s;uch a conque&s;t as me;</L>
<L>But you &s;h' n't know his name, tho' I told you before;</L>
<L>It begins with an M, but I dare not &s;ay <HI>More.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1753 Mr. Moore commenced a weekly
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
mi&s;cellaneous paper entitled The World, by Adam Fitz-Adam, in which undertaking he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lord Che&s;terfield and other di&s;tingui&s;hed characters. This paper was collected and publi&s;hed in four vo|lumes; and Mr. Moore died &s;oon thereafter.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the following Poems have already made their appearance in detached pieces, but as many of them were printed without a name I was advi&s;ed by &s;ome particular friends to collect them into a volume and publi&s;h them by &s;ub&s;cription. The painful ta&s;k of &s;oliciting &s;uch a &s;ub&s;cription was chiefly undertaken by tho&s;e friends, and with &s;uch &s;pirit and zeal that I &s;hould be greatly wanting in gratitude if I neglected any opportunity either publick or private of making them my mo&s;t &s;incere acknowledgments. I am al&s;o obliged to a very valuable friend in Ireland for a con|&s;iderable number of &s;ub&s;cribers in that kingdom, a li&s;t of who&s;e names I have not been favoured with, and for which I was de&s;ired not to delay publication. I mention this &s;eeming neglect that my friends on that &s;ide the water may not accu&s;e me of any di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Such as the Work now is I &s;ubmit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many, which I have wanted both time and abilities to amend as I could wi&s;h. Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and tending to promote virtue and good-humour. Tho&s;e parts of it that have been publi&s;hed &s;ingly had the good fortune to plea&s;e; tho&s;e that are now added will I hope be no di&s;credit to them. Upon the whole, I have &s;ent this my offspring into the world in as decent a dre&s;s as I

was able: a legitimate one I am &s;ure it is; and if it &s;hould be thought defective in &s;trength, &s;pirit, or vi|gour, let it be con&s;idered that its father's marriage with the Mu&s;es, like mo&s;t other marriages into that noble family, was more from nece&s;&s;ity than inclina|tion.</P>

<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THOMAS HOLLES, DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I the honour of being per&s;onally known to your Grace I had not thus pre&s;umptuou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed you without previous &s;olicitation for &s;o great an indul|gence; but that your Grace may neither be &s;urpri&s;ed nor offended at the liberty I am taking my plea is, that the great and good man who&s;e name is prefixed to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Poems was a friend and benefac|tor to me. The favours I have received at his hands, and the kind a&s;&s;urances he was plea&s;ed to give me of their continuance, which his death only prevented, have left me to lament my own private lo&s;s amid&s;t the general concern. It is from the&s;e favours and a&s;&s;urances that I flatter my&s;elf with having a kind of privilege to addre&s;s your Grace upon this occa&s;ion, and to entreat your patronage of the following &s;heets. I pretended to no merit with Mr. Pelham except that of honouring his virtues, and wi&s;hing to have been &s;erviceable to them: I pretend to no other with your Grace. My hopes are, that while you are fulfilling every generous intention of the brother whom you loved your Grace will not think me unworthy of &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of that notice with which he was once plea&s;ed to honour me.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11">
I will not detain your Grace to echo back the voice of a whole people in favour of your ju&s;t and prudent admini&s;tration of publick affairs: that the &s;alutary mea|&s;ures you are pur&s;uing may be as productive of tran|quillity and honour to your Grace as they are of hap|pine&s;s to the&s;e kingdoms is the &s;incere wi&s;h of,</P>
