<HEAD>ANIMADVERSIONS On a Late PAMPHLET, INTITULED, The New Arian Reprov'd.</HEAD>
<P>SInce there is a Pamphlet intituled the <HI>New Arian Reprov'd</HI> ju&s;t Publi&s;h'd, before my Four Volumes come out, I &s;hall make a few tho' very &s;hort <HI>Animadver&s;ions</HI> thereon. Accordingly, omitting &s;everal injudicious and unfair Pa&s;&s;ages, I Ob&s;erve. (1) That if I, as an Heretick, have written too in&s;olently, my Antagoni&s;ts as Orthodox, &s;hould do better; and thereby &s;hew how Athana&s;iani&s;m di&s;po&s;es Men to Chri&s;tian Meekne&s;s and Humility more than Ariani&s;m. Which yet I dare &s;ay neither this Author, nor Mr. <HI>Mattair,</HI> and lea&s;t of all Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> have done.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 7.</NOTE> (2) That my plainne&s;s and boldne&s;s in reproving the dange|rous Errors remaining in our Church is inter|preted an high <HI>Affront:</HI> Whereas I take it to be the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s I can do her. I hope this Author does not &s;uppo&s;e he affronts his Auditors every time he plainly and boldly rebukes them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>8,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> (3) I &s;hall willingly allow this Author &s;everal whole Years to collect the Tenth part of the Te&s;timonies for Orthodoxy in the Two fir&s;t Centuries, that I did in a few Months, for Ariani&s;m&punc; Nor am I at all unwilling to join I&s;&s;ue with him in the very &s;ame proportion for the Third Century al&s;o; provided he will not produce tho&s;e Te&s;timo|nies that &s;olely depend on <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> or a few
<PB N="2" REF="2">
of his followers, without, nay again&s;t all the other and better Evidence about them. (4) What is here &s;aid about Dr. <HI>Grabes E&s;&s;ay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p <HI>13,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and my <HI>New Theory</HI> I &s;hall not repeat, but only de&s;ire the impartial Readers careful peru&s;al of my <HI>Remarks</HI> on that <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>; and my <HI>Second Edition</HI> of that <HI>Theory,</HI> before &s;uch Reflections have any Weight with him. And I mu&s;t declare how reproach|ful &s;oever this Author e&s;teems it in me, yet that I ever re&s;olve to own and correct all my mi&s;takes a&s;&s;oon as ever they appear to be &s;uch, in all my Writings; and by that means do hope to render tho&s;e Writings at la&s;t much more Correct and Undenyable; while the oppo&s;ite vain Affecta|tion in controver&s;y Writers of ju&s;tifying every Expre&s;&s;ion and Conjecture, even after plain Evidence is produc'd to the contrary, hinders their own Improvement, and makes them &s;till propagate Error among Mankind. (5) Sure tho&s;e Learned Men who mainly recommend the three fir&s;t Centuries, as the Standard of antient Chri&s;tianity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p</HI> 17.18.</NOTE> cannot properly include the Coun|cil of <HI>Nice</HI> belonging to the fourth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>18,</HI> &amp;c</NOTE> (6) We have here a mighty Stir about this Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> and how much 'tis to be prefer'd to other Coun|cils. As if there was no Pa&s;&s;ion, nor Heat, nor worldly Concern, nor Court Management at that Council at all; but the whole was peaceably debated, and all guided by the good Spirit of God. Which if this Author can believe he may do as he plea&s;es; while I am &s;ure the Hi&s;tories thereof, how partial &s;oever on its &s;ide, give us very different Accounts. And whatever that Council determin'd, we are to believe no more of it than what is proved by the Sacred and Pri|mitive Writers; and what is proved by them we are to believe without regard to its Determina|tion.
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">
So that 'tis not of great Weight what this or any other &s;uch warm Councils determin'd, to tho&s;e I mean who with me de&s;ire to follow the proper Authority of Chri&s;t by his Holy Apo&s;tles in &s;acred matters. Our Author here &s;eems to believe all the partial <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Ac|counts on the &s;ide of <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> as firmly as if the whole Chri&s;tian World had own'd the Truth of them. Whereas one that &s;tands &s;o &s;tifly for the Au|thority of Councils and Synods ought certainly to have &s;ome regard to the contrary Opinion of at lea&s;t 3 &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Councils in that Ca&s;e (7) After all that is here produc'd there appears little or no debating at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>26,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> more than what <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> oblig'd them to; and which might well be all at one time. So that their Creed, as far as I &s;ee, might be &s;ign'd the &s;ame day they met, as <HI>Monfaucon</HI> ob&s;erves: tho' I do not doubt but there was private In|trigues, and &s;ubtile Management before-hand; as there is, I believe, &s;till in all &s;uch A&s;&s;em|blies to this day&punc; If this Author can &s;hew that the <GAP DESC="foreign"> was here fully debated, and proved to have all the way been deliver'd down from the Apo&s;tles, he will &s;ay &s;omething; otherwi&s;e all the political Management and Arts previous to the final Determination will be of no con|&s;equence in this Ca&s;e. And I de&s;ire to know if the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> did &s;o unanimou&s;ly, and upon &s;uch undenyable Authority e&s;tabli&s;h this, as the undoubted perpetual Faith of Chri&s;tians: How a more numerous Council, that of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI>; to &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> could in ten years time quite lo&s;e the Notion, and &s;ettle the Church upon a Founda|tion without it: as if they never knew of any &s;uch antient Tradition or Doctrine among Chri|&s;tians
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">
at all? This is certainly a Que&s;tion to be well weighed by tho&s;e that depend &s;o intirely on the Council of <HI>Nice.</HI> (8) I have fully, in more places than one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p <HI>31,</HI> &amp;c</NOTE> declar'd how far I am an Arian. Nor can any one doubt from all I have &s;aid that in my uncertain philo&s;ophick Conjectures, I incline more to the Followers of <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf than of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>: but in my certain Faith I keep &s;trictly to the original Do|ctrine and Expre&s;&s;ions alone; with an utter Ab|horrence of all Novel and ra&s;h <HI>Arian,</HI> as well as <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Additions and Language in &s;uch mat|ters; as I think 'tis the plain Duty of every Chri|&s;tian to do. I take <HI>Eunomius</HI> to have been a much more Learned, Judicious, Wi&s;e, and Good Man, than <HI>Arius</HI>: and &s;o I may well &s;peak with great Re&s;pect of the one, while I have no great E|&s;teem for the other; altho' Cu&s;tom may call <HI>Eunomius</HI> a mo&s;t compleat Arian, in a general Acceptation, as di&s;tingui&s;h'd from other Parties then contending in the Church. And the Apo|logetick of this <HI>Eunomius,</HI> which I am going to publi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> certainly &s;hew what a great Man he was. I have read nothing of the Orthodox in this Century, for Piety, Judgment, and clo&s;e Ad|herence to the antient Faith and Language of Chri&s;tians to be compar'd to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>36,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> (9) To prove that the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> did not own that <HI>Solomon Prov.</HI> 8.22. &s;aid that God <HI>Created</HI> our Saviour, while they forbad that Expre&s;&s;ion under the Pe|nalty of Here&s;y, this Author &s;ays that is not the meaning of the Hebrew Word in this place. If this be Logick I own I have none. For my Ar|gument depended not on the real Sen&s;e of the Hebrew, but on the confe&s;&s;ed Language and Sen&s;e of the Greek, which the Church us'd; and I think none call'd in que&s;tion till after the
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">
Council of <HI>Nice.</HI> So that all that is here &s;aid is intirely remote from the point. For the Antient Te&s;timonies they are &s;oon to be laid before the Reader, and he is him&s;elf to judge whether they are only &s;ome <HI>unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> or whether they do not contain the direct and plain <HI>Doctrine of the two fir&s;t Centuries of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> I believe our Author will find it hard, to &s;et them in a <HI>clear irre&s;i&s;tible Light,</HI> on the &s;ide of Orthodoxy, as he here &s;peaks. (10) As to the Con&s;titutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>39,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> with their Interpolations, and Doxologies, I refer this Author to my E&s;&s;ay upon them, which is now to be Publi&s;h'd; and am not afraid &s;till to a&s;&s;ert, notwith&s;tanding all this Authors Excla|mations, that they are <HI>the mo&s;t Sacred of the Ca|nonical Books of the New Te&s;tament.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>43,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> (11) To prove that my Lord of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> is Angry with me for tran&s;po&s;ing &s;ome Parts of the former Thirteen Chapters of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> he alledges that his Lord|&s;hip differs from me about the Day of Chri&s;ts Death, and &s;ome Circum&s;tances belonging to his Pa&s;&s;ion in the Twenty Sixth and Twenty Seventh Chapters. If our Reflecter goes on in this way of rea&s;oning he will &s;oon become Unan&s;werable.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 49, 50</NOTE> I believe Mon&s;ieur <HI>Toinards</HI> is an excellent Har|mony, by what &s;mall &s;ight I have had of it; but &s;ure I may venture to differ from him, or omit his large Book in a &s;mall Catalogue, with|out any great Imputation of Ignorance; e&s;|pecially while there were &s;o few Copies of it in <HI>England</HI> when I wrote that Catalogue.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 50, 51</NOTE> As to the Eighty Fifth Canon I did certainly di&s;|cover its being Apo&s;tolical long before I found the re&s;t to be &s;o: Let this Author &s;ay what he plea&s;es. And as to Dr. <HI>Grabes</HI> proper denyal of any thing I have related of him, I can hardly find it:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 52, 53</NOTE> For as to the general Charge of Mi&s;|repre&s;entation,

&s;o common in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, he rather intimates he will make it good here|after, than has yet done it. So that all our Au|thors Flouri&s;hes here are upon very little Foun|dation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>54,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Nor does he &s;eem to differ much from me at la&s;t about the meaning of the Scripture Phra&s;es u&s;ually interpreted of a proper Eternity; notwith&s;tanding his &s;hew of &s;till confuting and reproaching me thereupon. And for the Cita|tions from <HI>Ignatius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 56</NOTE> &s;ure the Quotations in tho&s;e Fathers he means are of <HI>later Writers,</HI> or <HI>Writers</HI> much <HI>later</HI> than <HI>Ignatius</HI>; and in no other Sen&s;e did I u&s;e tho&s;e Words; For I did not then, nor do yet remember of what particular Antiquity the Citations he refers to were &s;uppos'd to be. (12) The <HI>Preface</HI> to the Arabick Doctrine is that which I alone Publi&s;h'd, and mainly depended on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 57</NOTE> as I &s;till do; and till its Authority be di&s;|prov'd, which I believe cannot be done, it certainly goes a great way to <HI>put an End to the Di&s;pute</HI> about the Con&s;titutions <HI>for ever.</HI> (13) This Author is to prove Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI> once a <HI>Socinian,</HI> even notwith&s;tanding &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in his Writings intirely di&s;agree thereto.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. <HI>57,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Now &s;ure this Author might have &s;uppos'd that I knew an Intimate Friends Opinions both former and later better than a meer Stranger could do: And that I would not notoriou&s;ly fal&s;ify in &s;uch a plain ca&s;e. And I &s;till a&s;&s;ure him I &s;pake the direct Truth. And that he may learn to examin better before he <HI>Writes</HI> any more about Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>'s Opinions, I &s;hall tell him what I know of them, both from his Writings, and from his own Month, <HI>viz.</HI> that when formerly he examin'd that matter, he found that our Saviour Pre-exi&s;ted, and mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> probably made the World, as the Fathers In+&s;trument: And &s;o he was not a <HI>Socinian.</HI> Nay h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

inclin'd mo&s;t to the <HI>Arians.</HI> But ob&s;erving how he was call'd a <HI>Man,</HI> and not knowing what powers even Human Nature, in a Pre-exi&s;ting State, might be capable of deriving from God, when he pleas'd to inhabit in it, or intimately unite him&s;elf in it, he car'd not to enter deep into the Di&s;pute between the Socinians and Ari|ans; but a&s;&s;erted, what he was more fully &s;ati&s;|fied in, that Chri&s;t was not the &s;ame Being with, or equal to the &s;upreme God: and that the &s;ub|ordinate Wor&s;hip requir'd to be paid him did not imply any &s;uch Things. That the&s;e were his real Thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humble En|quiry p. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> his own Words in the Pa|ges here cited do &s;hew, which are the&s;e. <HI>So that it &s;hould &s;eem, that Nature which did pre-exi&s;t did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;upreme Will.&mdash;Tho' he be allow'd to be a Man, approved of God by Signs and mighty Wonders,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 21,</NOTE> <HI>which God did by him, and by whom God made the World as the In&s;trument.</HI> This is al&s;o more plain by his intire little Treati&s;e in Vindication of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glouce&s;ters</HI> Pre-exi&s;tence of the Soul of Chri&s;t al&s;o. But how a Pa&s;&s;age from Bi&s;hop <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> who &s;eems to have known no more than our Author, what Mr. <HI>Emlins</HI> Opinions were, is a proof that he was a Socinian, I by no means under|&s;tand.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 59</NOTE> So mi&s;erably do &s;uch Writers of Contro|ver&s;y argue when they pretend, without proper evidence, to affix odious Opinions and Imputa|tions upon their Adver&s;aries: for which this Author, among the re&s;t, mu&s;t give an Account another day, notwith&s;tanding his &s;trange way of Writing here, &s;o little agreeing with Truth or with Chri&s;tianity. Nor does he rea&s;on better, when from the Verdict of a Jury of Trade&s;men, He con|cludes the &s;ame Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI> really guilty of <HI>Bla&s;|phemy</HI>; and accordingly treats him, as well as my &s;elf, as <HI>Bla&s;phemers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 65 66:</NOTE> Yet 'tis to me prodigi|ou&s;ly

&s;trange that the <HI>Subordination</HI> of Chri&s;t to the Father &s;hould be exact Orthodoxy, while his <HI>Inferiority</HI> borders on no le&s;s a Crime than <HI>Bla&s;phemy.</HI> I hope it will in a little time be hard to make Mankind believe any &s;uch extravagant A&s;&s;ertions, let them be deliver'd with never &s;o great an Air of Magi&s;terial Authority.

The Quotation of which interpolated Text is the more &s;trange here, &s;ince by his Silence, he &s;eems to de&s;ert the other more certain and gro&s;s Orthodox Interpolation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 26.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> v. 7.
