<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION in Eight Volumes in Twelves; and to the FOURTH EDITION in Octavo.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Hi&s;tory is given in a Series of Letters written principally in a double yet &s;eparate Corre&s;pondence;</P>
<P>Between two young Ladies of virtue and honour, bearing an inviolable friend&s;hip for each other, and writing not merely for amu&s;ement, but upon the mo&s;t <HI>intere&s;ting</HI> &s;ubjects; in which every private family, more or le&s;s, may find it&s;elf con|cerned: And,</P>
<P>Between two Gentlemen of free lives; one of them glorying in his talents for Stratagem and Inven|tion, and communicating to the other, in confidence,
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
all the &s;ecret purpo&s;es of an intriguing head and re&s;olute heart.</P>
<P>But here it will be proper to ob&s;erve, for the &s;ake of &s;uch as may apprehend hurt to the morals of Youth, from the more freely written Letters, that the Gentle|men, tho' profe&s;&s;ed Libertines as to the Female Sex, and making it one of their wicked maxims, to keep no faith with any of the Individuals of it, who are thrown into their power, are not, however, either Infidels or Scoffers; nor yet &s;uch as think them&s;elves freed from the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e other moral duties which bind man to man.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it will be found, in the progre&s;s of the Work, that they very often make &s;uch refle|ctions upon each other, and each upon him&s;elf, and his own actions, as rea&s;onable beings <HI>mu&s;t</HI> make, who di&s;be|lieve not a Future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, and who one day propo&s;e to reform&mdash;One of them actually reforming, and by that means giving an op|portunity to cen&s;ure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other.</P>
<P>And yet that other, altho' in unbo&s;oming him&s;elf to a &s;elect friend, he di&s;cover wickedne&s;s enough to intitle him to a general dete&s;tation, pre&s;erves a de|cency, as well in his images, as in his language, which is not always to be found in the works of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated modern Writers, who&s;e &s;ub|jects and characters have le&s;s warranted the liberties they have taken.</P>
<P>In the Letters of the two young Ladies, it is pre|&s;umed will be found not only the highe&s;t exerci&s;e of a rea&s;onable and <HI>practicable</HI> Friend&s;hip, between minds endowed with the noble&s;t principles of Virtue and Re|ligion,
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
but occa&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;ed, &s;uch Delicacy of Sentiments, particularly with regard to the other Sex; &s;uch in&s;tances of Impartiality, each freely, as a fun|damental principle of their friend&s;hip, blaming, prai&s;ing, and &s;etting right the other, as are &s;trongly to be re|commended to the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>younger</HI> part (more e&s;pecially) of the Female Readers.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e two young Ladies is propo&s;ed as an Exemplar to her Sex. Nor is it any objection to her being &s;o, that &s;he is not in all re&s;pects a perfect character. It was not only natural, but it was nece&s;|&s;ary, that &s;he &s;hould have &s;ome faults, were it only to &s;hew the Reader, how laudably &s;he could mi&s;tru&s;t and blame her&s;elf, and carry to her own heart, dive&s;ted of &s;elf-partiality, the cen&s;ure which aro&s;e from her own convictions, and that even to the acquittal of tho&s;e, becau&s;e revered characters, whom no one el&s;e would ac|quit, and to who&s;e much greater faults her errors were owing, and not to a weak or reproachable heart. As far as is con&s;i&s;tent with human frailty, and as far as &s;he could be perfect, con&s;idering the people &s;he had to deal with, and tho&s;e with whom &s;he was in&s;eparably con|nected, &s;he <HI>is</HI> perfect. To have been impeccable, mu&s;t have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a Purified State to do, and carried our idea of her from woman to angel. As &s;uch is &s;he often e&s;teemed by the man who&s;e <HI>heart</HI> was &s;o corrupt, that he could hardly believe human Nature capable of the purity, which, on every trial or temptation, &s;hone out <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the four principal per&s;ons, &s;everal others are introduced, who&s;e Letters are characteri&s;tic: And it is pre&s;umed that there will be found in &s;ome of them, but more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the chief character among the men, and the &s;econd character among the women, &s;uch &s;trokes of Gaiety, Fancy, and Humour,
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
as will entertain and divert; and at the &s;ame time both warn and in&s;truct.</P>
<P>All the Letters are written while the hearts of the writers mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be wholly engaged in their &s;ubjects (the events at the time generally dubious): So that they abound not only with critical Situations, but with what may be called <HI>in&s;tantaneous</HI> De&s;criptions and Reflections (proper to be brought home to the brea&s;t of the youthful Reader); as al&s;o with affecting Conver&s;ations; many of them written in the dialogue or dramatic way.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Much more</HI> lively and affecting, &s;ays one of the principal characters, mu&s;t be the Style of tho&s;e who write in the height of a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> di&s;tre&s;s; the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty (the Events then hidden in the womb of Fate); <HI>than</HI> the dry, narrative, unanimated Style of a Per&s;on relating difficulties and dangers &s;urmounted, can be; the relater perfectly at ea&s;e; and if him&s;elf unmoved by his own Story, not likely greatly to affect the Heart of the Reader."</Q></P>
<P>What will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following Work, is&mdash;To warn the Incon&s;iderate and Thoughtle&s;s of the one Sex, again&s;t the ba&s;e arts and de&s;igns of &s;pecious Contrivers of the other&mdash;To caution Parents again&s;t the undue exerci&s;e of their na|tural authority over their Children in the great article of Marriage&mdash;To warn Children again&s;t preferring a Man of Plea&s;ure to a Man of Probity, upon that dan|gerous but too commonly-received notion, <HI>That a Re|formed Rake makes the be&s;t Hu&s;band.</HI>&mdash;But above all, To inve&s;tigate the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important Doc|trines not only of Morality, but of Chri&s;tianity, by &s;hewing them thrown into action in the conduct of the
<PB N="v" REF="7">
<HI>worthy</HI> characters; while the <HI>unworthy,</HI> who &s;et tho&s;e Doctrines at defiance, are condignly, and, as may be &s;aid, con&s;equentially, puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, con&s;iderate Readers will not enter upon the peru&s;al of the Piece before them, as if it were de&s;igned <HI>only</HI> to divert and amu&s;e. It will probably be thought tedious to all &s;uch as <HI>dip</HI> into it, expecting a <HI>light Novel,</HI> or <HI>tran&s;itory Romance</HI>; and look upon Story in it (intere&s;ting as that is generally allowed to be) as its <HI>&s;ole end,</HI> rather than as a vehicle to the In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fault having been found, particularly by elderly Readers, and by &s;ome who have weak Eyes, with the Smallne&s;s of the Type, on which &s;ome Parts of the Three la&s;t Volumes were printed (which was done in order to bring the Work, that had extended to an un|de&s;irable Length, into as &s;mall a Compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible) the pre&s;ent Edition is uniformly printed on the larger|&s;ized Letter of the three made u&s;e of before. But the doing this, together with the Additions above-men|tioned, has unavoidably run the Seven Volumes into Eight.</P>
<P>The Work having been originally publi&s;hed at three different times; and a greater di&s;tance than was intended having pa&s;&s;ed between the fir&s;t publication and the &s;econd; a Preface was thought proper to be affixed to the third and fourth Volumes; being the &s;econd pub|lication. A very learned and eminent Hand was &s;o kind as to favour the Editor, at his reque&s;t, with one. But the occa&s;ion of in&s;erting it being <HI>temporary,</HI> and the Editor having been left at liberty to do with it as he plea&s;ed, it was omitted in the Second Edition, when the whole Work came to be printed together; as was, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the Preface to the fir&s;t Volume;
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
and a &s;hort Adverti&s;ement to the Reader in&s;erted in&s;tead of both. That Adverti&s;ement being al&s;o temporary, the pre&s;ent Addre&s;s to the Reader is &s;ub&s;tituted in its place.</P>
<P>In the Second Edition an ample <HI>Table of Contents</HI> to the <HI>whole</HI> Work was prefixed to the fir&s;t Volume: But that having in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated the Cata&s;trophe, and been thought to detain the Reader too long from entering upon the Hi&s;tory, it has been judged advi&s;e|able to <HI>add</HI> (and that rather than <HI>prefix</HI>) to <HI>each</HI> Volume its <HI>particular</HI> Contents; which will &s;erve not only as an Index, but as a brief Recapitulation of the mo&s;t material pa&s;&s;ages contained in it; and which will en|able the Reader to connect in his mind the peru&s;ed volume with that which follows; and more clearly &s;hew the characters and views of the particular cor|re&s;pondents.</P>
<P>An ingenious Gentleman having made a Collection of many of the Moral and In&s;tructive Sentiments in this Hi&s;tory, and pre&s;ented it to the Editor, he thought the de&s;ign and u&s;efulne&s;s of the Work could not be more &s;trikingly exhibited, than by in&s;erting it (greatly enlarged) at the end of the la&s;t Volume. The Reader will accordingly find it there, dige&s;ted under proper Heads, with References to the Pages where each Cau|tion, Aphori&s;m, Reflection, or Ob&s;ervation, is to be found, either wrought into the <HI>practice</HI> of the re&s;pective corre&s;pondents, or recommended by them as u&s;eful <HI>theory</HI> to the Youth of both Sexes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a kind of Nece&s;&s;ity to omit in this Volume, which contains the Re&s;tured Pa&s;&s;ages and Letters, the References to the parti|cular Pages; as there were two Editions to be referred to, had they been in&s;erted; which would have only &s;erved to puzzle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd perplex the Reader: And it is humbly pre&s;umed, that the Sentiments or Maxims are, generally, of &s;uch Importance, as to be &s;ound not unworthy of the Ob&s;ervation of the youthful Reader, altho' they were not to have the clo&s;e Relation which they <HI>have,</HI> to the Hi&s;tory of CLARISSA.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">Different Per&s;ons, as might be expected, have been of different opinions, in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular Situations; and &s;everal worthy per&s;ons have objected to the general Cata&s;trophe, and other parts of the Hi&s;tory. Whatever is thought material of the&s;e &s;hall be taken notice of by way of POSTSCRIPT, at the conclu&s;ion of the Hi&s;tory; for this Work being addre&s;&s;ed to the Public as a Hi&s;tory of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> tho&s;e parts of it which are propo&s;ed to carry with them the force of an Example, ought to be as unobjectible as is con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>de&s;ign of the whole,</HI> and with <HI>human nature.</HI></P>

<P>WOULD you not have thought, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, as well as I, that my propo&s;al mu&s;t have been accepted? And that my Brother, by the la&s;t article of his unbrotherly Letter (where he threatens to go to Scotland if it &s;hould be hearkened to) was of opinion that it <HI>would?</HI></P>
<P>For my part, after I had read the unkind Letter
<PB N="5" REF="14">
over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a Reconciliation upon terms &s;o di&s;advantageous to my|&s;elf, as hardly any other per&s;on in my ca&s;e, I dare &s;ay, would have propo&s;ed, mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of this morn|ing's conference. And in that belief I had begun to give my&s;elf new trouble in thinking (this difficulty over) how I &s;hould be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement, by which I undertook to break off all corre&s;pondence with him, unle&s;s my friends &s;hould be brought by the interpo&s;ition of his powerful friends, and any offers they might make (which it was rather <HI>his</HI> part to &s;ugge&s;t, than <HI>mine</HI> to intimate) to change their minds.</P>
<P>Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you may believe, becau&s;e of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with; when breakfa&s;ting-time ap|proached, and my judges began to arrive.</P>
<P>And oh! how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle thro' the court-yard, and the hollow-&s;ounding foot&s;tep giv|ing notice of each per&s;on's &s;tepping out, to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges!</P>
<P>That, thought I, is my Aunt Heryey's! That my Uncle Harlowe's! Now comes my Uncle Antony! And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes, altho' it happened that he was not there.</P>
<P>And now, thought I, are they all a&s;&s;embled: And now my Brother calls upon my Si&s;ter to make <HI>her</HI> re|port! Now the hard-hearted Bella interlards her &s;peech with invective! Now has &s;he concluded her report! Now they debate upon it!&mdash;Now does my Brother flame! Now threaten to go to Scotland! Now is he chidden, and now &s;oothed!</P>
<P>And then I ran thro' the whole conference in my imagination, forming &s;peeches for this per&s;on and that, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> till all concluded, as I flattered my&s;elf, in an acceptance of my conditions, and in giving di|rections
<PB N="6" REF="15">
to have an in&s;trument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour: While I &s;uppo&s;ed all agreed to give Solmes a Wife every way more worthy of him, and with <HI>her</HI> the promi&s;e of my Grandfather's E&s;tate, in ca&s;e of my forfeiture, or dying unmarried, on the righteous condition he propo&s;es to entitle him&s;elf to it with me.</P>
<P>And now, thought I, am I to be ordered down to recognize my own propo&s;als. And how &s;hall I look upon my awful judges? How &s;hall I &s;tand the que|&s;tions of &s;ome, the &s;et &s;urline&s;s of others, the return|ing love of one or two? How &s;hall I be affected!</P>
<P>Then I wept: Then I dried my eyes: Then I practi&s;ed at my gla&s;s for a look more chearful than my heart.</P>
<P>And now [as any-thing &s;tirred] is my Si&s;ter coming to declare the i&s;&s;ue of all: Tears gu&s;hing again, my heart fluttering as a bird again&s;t its wires; drying my eyes again and again to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus, my Nancy (excu&s;e the fanciful prolixity) was I employed, and &s;uch were my thoughts and ima|ginations, when I found a very different re&s;ult from the hopeful conference.</P>
<P>For about Ten o'clock up came my Si&s;ter, with an air of cruel triumph, waving her hand with a light flouri&s;h&mdash;</P>
<P>Obedience without re&s;erve is required of you, Clary, My Papa is ju&s;tly incen&s;ed, that you &s;hould <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to di&s;pute his will, and to make conditions with him. He knows what is be&s;t for you: And as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Love|lace and you, they will believe nothing you &s;ay; ex|cept you will give the <HI>only</HI> in&s;tance, that will put them out of doubt of the &s;incerity of your promi&s;es.</P>
<P>What, child, are you &s;urpri&s;ed?&mdash;Cannot you &s;peak?&mdash;Then, it &s;eems, you had expected a different i&s;&s;ue, had you?&mdash;Strange that you could! &mdash;With all your acknowlegements and confe&s;&s;ions, &s;o creditable to your <HI>noted prudence!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">I was indeed &s;peechle&s;s for &s;ome time: My eyes were even fixed, and cea&s;ed to flow. But, upon the hard-hearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of in&s;ult, Indeed I <HI>was</HI> mi&s;taken, &s;aid I; Indeed I was!&mdash;For in you, Bella, I expected, I hoped for, a Si&s;ter&mdash;</P>
<P>What! interrupted &s;he, with all your mannerly flings, and your de&s;pi&s;ing airs, did you expect, that I was capable of telling &s;tories for you?&mdash;Did you think, that when I was a&s;ked my own opinion of the &s;incerity of your declarations, I could not tell them, <HI>how far matters had gone between you and your Fellow?</HI>&mdash; When the intention is to bend that &s;tubborn will of yours to your duty, do you think I would deceive them?&mdash;Do you think I would encourage them to call you down, to contradict all that I &s;hould have <HI>invented</HI> in your favour?</P>
<P>Well, well, Bella; I am the le&s;s obliged to you; that's all. I was willing to think, that I had &s;till a Brother and Si&s;ter. But I find I am mi&s;taken.</P>

<P>Then &s;ay, Lovelace is a villain.</P>
<P>So I will, when I think him &s;o.</P>
<P>Then you don't think him &s;o?</P>
<P>Indeed I don't. <HI>You</HI> did not always, Bella.</P>
<P>And what, Clary, mean you by that? [bri&s;tling up to me]&mdash;Tell me what you mean by that reflection?</P>
<P>Tell me why you call it a reflection?&mdash;What did I &s;ay?</P>
<P>Thou art a provoking creature&mdash;But what &s;ay you to two or three duels of that wretch's?</P>
<P>I can't tell what to &s;ay, unle&s;s I knew the occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Do you ju&s;tify duelling at all?</P>
<P>I do not: Neither can I help his duelling.</P>
<P>Will you go down, and humble that &s;tubborn &s;pi|rit of yours to your Mamma?</P>
<P>I &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>Shall I conduct your Lady&s;hip down? [offering to take my declined hand].</P>
<P>What! not vouch&s;afe to an&s;wer me?</P>
<P>I turned from her in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>What! turn your back upon me too!&mdash;Shall I bring up your Mamma to you, Love? [following me, and taking my &s;truggling hand]. What! not &s;peak yet! Come, my &s;ullen, &s;ilent dear, &s;peak one word to me&mdash;You mu&s;t &s;ay <HI>two</HI> very &s;oon to Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.</P>
<P>Then [gu&s;hing out into tears, which I could not hold in longer] they &s;hall be the la&s;t words I will ever &s;peak.</P>
<P>Well, well [in&s;ultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief, while her other hand held mine, in a ridiculing tone] I am glad any-thing will make thee &s;peak: Then you think you may be

<P>Ridiculous Bella!</P>
<P>Saucy Clary! [changing her &s;neering tone to an imperious one]. But do you think you can humble your&s;elf to go down to your Mamma?</P>
<P>I am tired with &s;uch &s;tuff as this. Tell me, Bella, if my Mamma will conde&s;cend to &s;ee me?</P>
<P>Yes, if you can be dutiful at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I can. I will.</P>
<P>But what call you dutiful?</P>
<P>To give up my own <HI>inclinations</HI>&mdash;That's &s;omething more for you to tell of&mdash;in obedience to my Parents commands; and to beg I may not be made mi&s;er|able with a man that is fitter for <HI>any-body</HI> than for me.</P>
<P>For <HI>me,</HI> do you mean, Clary?</P>
<P>Why not? &s;ince you have put the que&s;tion. You have a better opinion of him than I have. My friends, I hope, would not think him too good for <HI>me,</HI> and not good <HI>enough</HI> for <HI>you</HI>&mdash;But cannot you tell me, Bella, what is to become of me, without in&s;ulting over me thus?&mdash;If I mu&s;t be thus treated, remember, that if I am guilty of any ra&s;hne&s;s, the u&s;age I meet with will ju&s;tify it.</P>
<P>So, Clary, you are contriving an <HI>excu&s;e,</HI> I find, for &s;omewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while.</P>
<P>If it were &s;o, you &s;eem re&s;olved, for <HI>your</HI> part, and &s;o does my Brother for <HI>his,</HI> that I &s;hall not want one. &mdash;But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this repe|tition of the wor&s;t part of ye&s;terday's conver&s;ation. I de&s;ire I may throw my&s;elf at my Father's and Mother's feet, and hear from them what their &s;entence is. I &s;hall at lea&s;t avoid, by that means, the un&s;i&s;terly in|&s;ults I meet with from you.</P>
<P>Hey-day! What! is this you? Is it you, my meek Si&s;ter Clary?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19">Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to pre&s;erve to my|&s;elf the Liberty of <HI>refu&s;al,</HI> which belongs to my Sex; and, to plea&s;e my Parents, would give up my <HI>choice.</HI> I have contented my&s;elf till now to take <HI>&s;econd-hand</HI> me&s;&s;engers, and <HI>fir&s;t-hand</HI> in&s;ults: You are but my Si&s;ter: My Brother is not my Sovereign.

<P>She &s;tood agha&s;t all this time, partly with real, partly with affected &s;urprize.</P>
<P>And is it <HI>you?</HI> Is it <HI>indeed</HI> you?&mdash;Well, Clary, you amaze me!

Your friends are not yet gone, I believe: They &s;hall a&s;&s;emble again; and then you may come down, and plead your own cau&s;e in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Let me then. But let my <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>you</HI> be ab|&s;ent. You have made your&s;elves too much <HI>parties</HI> again&s;t me, to &s;it as my judges. And I de&s;ire to have none of yours or his interpo&s;itions. I am &s;ure you could not have repre&s;ented what I propo&s;ed fairly: I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> you could not. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned</HI> to treat me thus.</P>
<P>Well, well, I'll call up my Brother to you.&mdash;I will indeed.&mdash;He &s;hall ju&s;tify him&s;elf, as well as me.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire not to &s;ee my Brother, except he will come <HI>as</HI> a Brother, laying a&s;ide the authority he has unju&s;tly a&s;&s;umed over me.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Clary, it is nothing to him, or to me, is it? that our Si&s;ter &s;hall di&s;grace her whole family?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20">As how, Bella, di&s;grace it?&mdash;The man whom you thus freely treat, is a man of birth and fortune: He is a man of parts, and nobly allied.&mdash;He was once thought worthy of you; and I wi&s;h to Heaven you had had him. I am &s;ure it was not my fault you had not, altho' you treat me thus!</P>
<P>This &s;et her into a flame: I wi&s;h I had forborn it. O how the poor Bella raved! I thought &s;he would have beat me once or twice: And &s;he vowed, her fingers itched to do &s;o&mdash;But I was not worth her <HI>anger:</HI> Yet &s;he flamed on.</P>
<P>We were heard to be high.&mdash;And Betty came up from my Mother to command my Si&s;ter to attend her.&mdash;She went down accordingly, threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had &s;hewn my&s;elf to be.</P>

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with infinite regret that I think my&s;elf obliged, by pen and ink, to repeat my apprehen&s;ions, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to obtain a &s;hare in the Affections of your beloved Daughter. O that it were not too evident to every one, as well as to my&s;elf, even to our very &s;ervants, that my Love for her, and my A&s;&s;iduities, expo&s;e me rather to her Scorn [For|give me, Madam, the hard word!] than to the treat|ment due to a man who&s;e propo&s;als have met with your approbation, and who loves her above all the women in the world!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23">Well might the merit of my pa&s;&s;ion be doubted, if, like Mr. Solmes to the truly admirable Mi&s;s Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe, I could continue my addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Howe's di&s;ta&s;te. Yet what will not the di&s;continu|ance co&s;t me!</P>
<P>Give me leave, neverthele&s;s, deare&s;t, worthie&s;t Lady, to repeat, what I told you, on Monday night, at Mrs. Larkins's, with a heart even bur&s;ting with grief, That I wanted not the treatment of that day to convince me, that I am not, nor ever can be, the object of Mi&s;s Howe's voluntary favour. What hopes can there be, that a Lady will ever e&s;teem, as a Hu&s;band, the man, whom, as a Lover, &s;he de|&s;pi&s;es? Will not every act of obligingne&s;s from &s;uch a one, be con&s;trued an unmanly tamene&s;s of &s;pirit, and entitle him the more to her di&s;dain?&mdash;My heart is full: Forgive me if I &s;ay, that Mi&s;s Howe's treat|ment of me does no credit either to her education, or fine &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Since then it is too evident, that &s;he cannot e&s;teem me; and &s;ince, as I have heard it ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by the excellent Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, that Love is not a voluntary pa&s;&s;ion, would it not be ungenerous to &s;ubject the dear Daughter to the di&s;plea&s;ure of a Mo|ther &s;o ju&s;tly fond of her; and you, Madam, while you are &s;o good as to intere&s;t your&s;elf in my favour, to unea&s;ine&s;s? And why, were I to be even &s;ure, at la&s;t, of &s;ucceeding by means of your kind partiality to me, &s;hould I wi&s;h to make the Be&s;t-beloved of my &s;oul unhappy; &s;ince mutual mu&s;t be our happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery for life the con&s;equence to both?</P>
<P>My be&s;t wi&s;hes will for ever attend the dear, the ever-dear Lady! May her Nuptials be happy! They mu&s;t be &s;o, if &s;he marry the man &s;he can honour with her Love. Yet I will &s;ay, that whoever be the happy, the thrice happy man, he never can love her with a pa&s;&s;ion more ardent and more &s;incere than mine.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24">Accept, dear Madam, of my mo&s;t grateful thanks for a di&s;tinction that has been the only &s;upport of my pre&s;umption in the addre&s;s I am obliged, as utterly hopele&s;s, to di&s;continue. A di&s;tinction, on which (and not on my own merits) I had entirely relied; but which, I find, can avail me nothing. To the la&s;t hour of my life, it will give me plea&s;ure to think, that had your favour, your recommendation, been of &s;ufficient weight to conquer what &s;eems to be an in|vincible Aver&s;ion, I had been the happie&s;t of men.</P>

And the <HI>excellent</HI> Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash;Good-lack!&mdash;But take care, Mr. Hick|man, that you do not prai&s;e any woman living, let her be as admirable and as excellent as &s;he will, above your own Mi&s;tre&s;s. No polite man will do that, &s;urely.
<PB N="17" REF="26">
And take care too, that you do not make her or me think you are in earne&s;t in your anger&mdash;Ju&s;t tho' it may be, as anger only&mdash;I would not for a thou&s;and pounds, that Nancy &s;hould know that you can &s;o ea&s;ily part with her, if you have the Love for her which you declare you have.

I can a&s;&s;ure you, that every-body blames her for it. And <HI>why</HI> do they blame her?&mdash;Why? Becau&s;e they think you merit better treatment at her hands: And is not this to your cre|dit?

<P>But you are afraid you &s;hall be thought tame, per|haps, when married. That you &s;hall not be thought <HI>manly</HI> enough, I warrant!&mdash;And this was poor Mr. Howe's fear.

<P>It will be &s;een <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This Note is in&s;erted Vol. ii. p. 146. of the 2d Edition.</NOTE> in Vol. <HI>i.</HI> Letter <HI>xxxiv.</HI> that Mr. Lovelace's motive for &s;paring his Ro&s;ebud was twofold. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e his Pride was gratified by the Grand-mother's de&s;iring him to &s;pare her Grand-daughter. <HI>Many a pretty Rogue,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>had I &s;pared, whom I did not &s;pare, had my Power been acknowleged, and my Mercy in time implored. But the</HI> Debellare Su|perbos <HI>&s;hould be my motto, were I to have a new one.</HI></P>
<P>His other motive will be explained in the following pa&s;&s;age, in the &s;ame Letter. <HI>I never was &s;o hone&s;t, for &s;o long together,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;ince my matriculation.

A re|port in my favour from &s;implicities &s;o amiable, may e&s;tabli&s;h me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Accordingly, as the Reader will hereafter &s;ee, Mr. Lovelace finds by the <HI>Effects,</HI> his expectations from the contrivance he &s;et on foot by means of his agent Jo&s;eph Leman (who plays, as above, upon Betty Barnes) fully an&s;wered, tho' he could not know what pa&s;&s;ed on the oc|ca&s;ion between the two Ladies.</P>
<P>This explanation is the more nece&s;&s;ary to be given, as &s;everal of our Readers (thro' want of due attention) have attributed to Mr. Lovelace, on his behaviour to his Ro&s;ebud, a greater merit than was due to him; and moreover imagined, that it was improbable, that a man,

<P>WHY, Jack, thou need&s;t not make &s;uch a <HI>wonder|ment,</HI> as the girls &s;ay, if I &s;hould have taken large &s;trides already towards reformation; For do&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="30">
thou not &s;ee, that while I have been &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, night and day, pur&s;uing this &s;ingle charmer, I have infinitely le&s;s to an&s;wer for, than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have had? Let me &s;ee, how many days and nights?&mdash; Forty, I believe, after open trenches, &s;pent in the &s;ap only, and never a mine &s;prung yet!</P>
<P>By a moderate computation, a dozen kites might have fallen, while I have been only trying to en&s;nare this &s;ingle lark: Nor yet do I &s;ee when I &s;hall be able to bring her to my lure: More innocent days yet there|fore!&mdash;But reformation for my &s;talking-hor&s;e, I hope, will be a &s;ure, tho' a &s;low method to effect all my purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Then, Jack, <HI>thou</HI> wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen, &s;ince thy time would be otherwi&s;e wor&s;e em|ployed: And, after all, who knows but by creating new habits, at the expence of the old, a real reform|ation may be brought about? I have promi&s;ed it; and I believe there is a plea&s;ure to be found in being good, rever&s;ing that of Nat, Lee's madmen,
<Q>&mdash; Which none but <HI>good</HI> men know.</Q></P>
<P>By all this, &s;ee&s;t thou-not, how greatly preferable it is, on twenty accounts, to pur&s;ue a difficult, rather than an ea&s;y chace? I have a de&s;ire to inculcate this plea&s;ure upon thee, and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws, crows, and wigeons: I have a mind to &s;hew thee from time to time, in the cour&s;e of the corre&s;pondence thou ha&s;t &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed me to begin on this illu&s;trious occa&s;ion, that the&s;e exalted Ladies may be aba&s;ed, and to obviate one of the ob|jections that thou made&s;t to me, when we were la&s;t together, that the plea&s;ure which attends the&s;e nobler aims, remunerates not the pains they bring with them; &s;ince, like a paltry fellow as thou wert, thou a&s;&s;erted&s;t, that all women are alike.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t nothing, Jack, of the delicacies of intrigue: Nothing of the glory of outwitting the
<PB N="22" REF="31">
Witty and the Watchful: Of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius, rumi|nating which to u&s;e of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer, who in her day has given him unnumbered torments.&mdash; Thou, Jack, who, like a dog at his ea&s;e, contente&s;t thy&s;elf to growl over a bone thrown out to thee, do&s;t not know the joys of the chace, and in pur&s;uing a winding game: The&s;e I will endeavour to rou&s;e thee to, and thou wilt have rea&s;on doubly and trebly to thank me, as well becau&s;e of thy pre&s;ent delight, as with regard to thy pro&s;pects beyond the moon.</P>
<P>To this place I had written, purely to amu&s;e my|&s;elf, before I was admitted to my charmer. But now I have to tell thee, that I was quite right in my con|jecture, that &s;he would &s;et up for her&s;elf, and di&s;mi&s;s me: For &s;he has declared in &s;o many words, that &s;uch was her re&s;olution: And why? Becau&s;e, to be plain with me, the more &s;he &s;aw of <HI>me,</HI> and of <HI>my ways,</HI> the le&s;s &s;he liked of either.</P>
<P>This cut me to the heart!&mdash;I did not cry indeed!&mdash; Had I been a <HI>woman,</HI> I &s;hould tho'; and that mo&s;t plentifully: But I pulled out a white cambrick hand|kerchief: <HI>That</HI> I could command, but not my <HI>tears.</HI></P>
<P>She finds fault with my prote&s;tations; with my pro|fe&s;&s;ions; with my vows: I cannot cur&s;e a &s;ervant, the only privilege a ma&s;ter is known by, but I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be a trooper <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. iii.

<P>Then, Sir, let me tell you, had you been le&s;s upon your defiances, they would not have been irritated &s;o much again&s;t you. But nobody ever heard, that avowed de&s;pite to the Relations of a per&s;on was a proper court&s;hip either to that per&s;on, or to her friends.</P>

<P>And all that I know, Sir, is, that if I do give my Father the power of a negative, and he will be con|tented with <HI>that,</HI> it will be but my <HI>duty</HI> to give it him; and if I pre&s;erve one to my&s;elf, I &s;hall break thro' no obligation to <HI>you.</HI></P>

<P>All this is mighty good, Sir: But to what does it tend?</P>

<P>He then read to me part of Lady Betty's Letter; turning down the beginning, which was a little too &s;evere upon him, he &s;aid, for my eye: And I be|lieve, by the &s;tyle, the remainder of it was in a <HI>cor|rective</HI> &s;train.</P>

<P>I could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon it, in &s;pite of an expected <HI>tempe&s;t.</HI> So much wit, &s;o much beauty, &s;uch a lively manner, and &s;uch exceed|ing quickne&s;s and penetration! O Belford! &s;he mu&s;t be nobody's but mine. I can now account for, and ju&s;tify, Herod's command to de&s;troy his Mariamne, if he returned not alive from his Interview with Cae&s;ar: For were I to know, that it were but probable, that any other man were to have this charming creature, even after my death, the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that man's throat, were he a Prince.</P>
<P>I may be deemed by this Lady a rapid, a boi&s;terous Lover&mdash;and <HI>&s;he</HI> may like me the le&s;s for it: But all the Ladies I have met with till now, loved to rai&s;e a tempe&s;t, and to enjoy it: Nor did they ever rai&s;e it, but I enjoyed it too!&mdash;Lord &s;end as once happily to London!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Lovelace gives the following account of his rude rapture., when he &s;eized her hand, and put her, by his <HI>WILD</HI> manner, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es it</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 31, 32.</NOTE><HI>, into &s;o much terror.</HI></P>
<P>Darkne&s;s and light, I &s;wore, were convertible at her plea&s;ure: She could make any &s;ubject plau&s;ible.
<PB N="40" REF="49">
I was all error; &s;he all perfection. And I &s;natched her hand; and, more than ki&s;&s;ed it, I was ready to devour it. There was, I believe, a kind of phren&s;y in my manner, which threw her into a panic, like that of Semele perhaps, when the Thunderer, in all his maje&s;ty, &s;urrounded with ten thou&s;and cele&s;tial burning-gla&s;&s;es, was about to &s;corch her into a cinder.</P>
<P>HAD not my heart mi&s;given me, and had I not, ju&s;t in time, recollected that &s;he was not &s;o much in my power, but that &s;he might abandon me at her plea&s;ure, having more friends in that hou&s;e than I had, I &s;hould at that moment have made offers, that would have decided all, one way or other.&mdash;But, apprehend|ing that I had &s;hewed too much meaning in my pa&s;|&s;ion, I gave it another turn.&mdash;But little did the Charmer think what an e&s;cape either &s;he or I had (as the event might have proved) from the &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, which had like to have blown me into her arms. She was born, I told her, to make me happy, and to &s;ave a &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>He gives the re&s;t of his vehement &s;peech pretty nearly in the &s;ame words as the Lady gives them. And then proceeds:</HI></P>
<P>I SAW &s;he was frighted: And &s;he would have had Rea&s;on, had the &s;cene been London; and that place in London, which I have in view to carry her to. She confirmed me in my apprehen&s;ion, that I had alarmed her too much: She told me, that &s;he &s;aw what my boa&s;ted regard to her Injunctions was; and &s;he would take proper mea&s;ures upon it, as I &s;hould &s;oon find: That &s;he was &s;hocked at my violent airs; and if I hoped any favour from her, I mu&s;t that in&s;tant withdraw, and leave her to her recollection.</P>
<P>She pronounced this in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed &s;he was &s;et upon it; and, having &s;tept out of the <HI>gentle,</HI> the <HI>polite</HI> part I had &s;o newly engaged to act,
<PB N="41" REF="50">
I thought a ready obedience was the be&s;t atonement. And indeed I was &s;en&s;ible, from her anger and re|pul&s;es, that I wanted time my&s;elf for recollection. And &s;o I withdrew, with the &s;ame veneration as a pe|titioning &s;ubject would withdraw from the pre&s;ence of his Sovereign. But, Oh! Belford, had &s;he had but the lea&s;t patience with me&mdash;Had &s;he but made me think, that &s;he would forgive this initiatory ardor&mdash; Surely &s;he will not be always thus guarded.&mdash;</P>
<P>I had not been a moment by my&s;elf, but I was &s;en|&s;ible, that I had half-forfeited my newly-a&s;&s;umed cha|racter. It is exceedingly difficult, thou &s;ee&s;t, for an hone&s;t man to act in di&s;gui&s;es: As the Poet &s;ays, <HI>Thru&s;t Nature back with a pitchfork, it will return.</HI> I recollected, that what &s;he had in&s;i&s;ted upon, was really a part of that declared will, before &s;he left her Fa|ther's hou&s;e, to which in another ca&s;e (to humble her) I had pretended to have an inviolable regard. And when I remembred her words of <HI>Taking her mea&s;ures accordingly,</HI> I was re&s;olved to &s;acrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again, before &s;he had time to deter|mine upon any new mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>How &s;ea&s;onably to this purpo&s;e have come in my Aunt's and Cou&s;in's Letters!</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ent in again and again to implore her to admit me to her pre&s;ence, But &s;he will conclude a Letter &s;he is writing to Mi&s;s Howe, before &s;he will &s;ee me&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e to give an account of what has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>Two days, as I may &s;ay, off and on, have I been writing this long Letter. And yet I have not &s;ed all I would &s;ay. For, be it knone unto your Honner, as how I do not like that Capten Singelton, which I told you of <HI>in my two la&s;t Letters.</HI> He is always lay|ing his hedd and my young Ma&s;ter's hedd together; and I &s;u&s;pect much if &s;o be &s;ome mi&s;chef is not going on between them: And &s;till the more, as becau&s;e my elde&s;t young Lady &s;emes to be joined to them &s;ome|times.</P>
<P>La&s;t week my young ma&s;ter &s;ed before my fa&s;e, <HI>My harte's blood boiles over, Capten Singelton, for re|venge upon this</HI>&mdash;And he called your Honner by a name it is not for &s;uch a won as me to &s;ay what. Capten Singelton whi&s;pred my younge Ma&s;ter, being I was by. So younge Ma&s;ter &s;ed, <HI>You may &s;ay any-thing before Jo&s;eph; for althoff he looks &s;o &s;eellie, he has as good a harte, and as good a hedd, as any &s;arvante in the worlde nede to have.</HI> My con&s;cience touched me ju&s;t then. But why &s;houlde it? when all I do, is to prevente mi&s;cheff; and &s;eing your Honner has &s;o much patience, which younge Ma&s;ter has not; &s;o am not affeard of telling your Honner any-thing what&s;om|ever.</P>
<P>And furthermore, I have &s;uche a de&s;ire to de&s;arve your Honner's bounty to me, as mackes me let no|thing pa&s;s I can tell you of, to prevent harm: And too be&s;ides your Honner's goodne&s;s about the Blew
<PB N="49" REF="58">
Bore; which I have &s;o good an accounte of!&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hall be bounden to ble&s;s your Honner the longe&s;t day I have to live.</P>
<P>And then the Blew Bore is not all neither; &s;en', and ple&s;e your Honner, the pretty Sowe (God forgive me for ge&s;ting in &s;o &s;erus a matter) runs in my hedd likewi&s;e. I believe I &s;hall love her mayhap more than your Honner would have me; for &s;he begins to be kind and good-humered, and li&s;tens, and ple&s;e your Honner, licke as <HI>if &s;he was among beans,</HI> when I talke about the Blew Bore, and all that.</P>
<P>Prayey your Honner forgive the ge&s;ting of a poor plane man. We common fokes have our joys, and ple&s;e your Honner, lick as our betters have; and if we be &s;ometimes &s;nubbed, we can find our under|lings to &s;nub them agen: And if not, we can get a Wife mayhap, and &s;nub her: So are Ma&s;ters &s;ome how or other our&s;ells.</P>
<P>But how I try your Honner's patience!&mdash;Sarvants will &s;how their joiful hartes, tho'ff but in partinens, when encouredg'd.</P>
<P>Be ple&s;ed from the prems's to let me kno' if as how I can be put upon any &s;arvice to &s;arve your Honner, and to &s;arve my deere&s;t younge Lady; which God grant! For I begin to be affearde for her, hearing what pepel talck&mdash;To be &s;ure your Honner will not do her no <HI>harme,</HI> as a man may &s;ay. But I kno' your Honner mu&s;t be good to &s;o wonderous a younge Lady. How can you help it?&mdash;But heere my con&s;cience &s;mites me, that <HI>but for &s;ome of my &s;tories, which your Honner taute me, my old Ma&s;ter and my old Lady, and the two old Squiers, would not have been abell to be half &s;o hard-harted as they be, for all what my young Ma&s;ter and young Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ayes.</HI></P>
<P>And here is the &s;ad thing; they cannot come to clere up matters with my deere&s;t young Lady, be|cau&s;e, as <HI>your Honner has ordered it,</HI> they have the&s;e &s;tories as if bribed by me out of your Honner's &s;ar|vant;

which mu&s;t not be known, for fere you &s;hould kill'n and me too, and blacken the briber!&mdash;Ah! your Honner!&mdash;I doute as that I am a very vild fel|low (Lord ble&s;s my &s;oul, I pray God) and did not intend it.</P>
<P>But if my deere&s;t young Lady &s;hould come to harm, and ple&s;e your Honner, the hor&s;epond at the Blew Bore&mdash;But Lord pre&s;erve us all from all bad mi&s;cheff, and all bad endes, I pray the Lord!&mdash;For tho'ff your Honner is kinde to me in worldly pelff, yet <HI>what &s;hall a man get to loos his &s;oul,</HI> as holy Skrittuer &s;ays, and ple&s;e your Honner?</P>

<SALUTE>Hone&s;t Jo&s;eph,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a wor&s;e opinion of your invention than you ought to have. I mu&s;t prai&s;e it again. Of a plain man's head I have not known many better than yours. How often have your foreca&s;t and di&s;|cretion an&s;wered my wi&s;hes in ca&s;es which I could not fore&s;ee, not knowing how my general directions would &s;ucceed, or what might happen in the execution of them! You are too doubtful of your own abilities, hone&s;t Jo&s;eph; that's your fault. But it being a fault that is owing to natural <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> you ought rather to be <HI>pitied</HI> for it than <HI>blamed.</HI></P>
<P>The affair of Mi&s;s Betterton was a youthful fro|lick. I love dearly to exerci&s;e my invention. I do
<PB N="51" REF="60">
a&s;&s;ure you, Jo&s;eph, that I have ever had more plea|&s;ure in my Contrivances than in the End of them. I am no &s;en&s;ual man; but a man of &s;pirit&mdash;One wo|man is like another&mdash;<HI>You under&s;tand me, Jo&s;eph</HI>&mdash;In Cour&s;ing all the &s;port is made by the winding Hare. A barn-door Chick is better eating. <HI>Now you take me, Jo&s;eph.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Betterton was but a Trade&s;man's daughter. The family indeed were grown rich, and aimed at a new Line of Gentry; and were unrea&s;onable enough to expect a man of my family would marry her. I was hone&s;t. I gave the young Lady no hope of that; for &s;he put it to me. She re&s;ented: Kept up, and was kept up. A little innocent Contrivance was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to get her out&mdash;But no Rape in the ca&s;e, I a&s;|&s;ure you, Jo&s;eph&mdash;She loved me: I loved her. In|deed, when I got her to the Inn, I a&s;ked her no que&s;tions. It is cruel to a&s;k a mode&s;t woman for her con&s;ent. It is creating difficulties to both. Had not her friends been officious, I had been con&s;tant and faithful to her to this day, as far as I know&mdash;For then I had not known my Angel.</P>
<P>I went not abroad upon <HI>her</HI> account. She loved me too well to have appeared again&s;t me. She refu&s;ed to &s;ign a paper they had drawn up for her, to found a pro&s;ecution upon: And the brutal creatures would not permit the midwife's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, till her life was in danger; and I believe to this her death was owing.</P>
<P>I went into mourning for her, tho' abroad at the time. A di&s;tinction I have ever paid to tho&s;e worthy creatures who died in Childbed by me.</P>
<P>I was ever nice in my Loves. The&s;e were the rules I laid down to my&s;elf on my entrance into active life: To &s;et the mother above want, if her friends were cruel, and if I could not get her an hu&s;band worthy of her: To &s;hun common women: A piece of ju&s;tice I owed to innocent Ladies, as well as to my&s;elf: To marry off a former mi&s;tre&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="52" REF="61">
before I took to a new one: To maintain a Lady hand&s;omely in her lying-in: To provide for the Little one, if it lived, according to the degree of its mo|ther: To go into mourning for the mother, if &s;he died. And the promi&s;e of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears, as they grew near their times.</P>
<P>All my errors, all my expences, have been with and upon women. So I could acquit my con&s;cience (acting thus honourably by them) as well as my di&s;|cretion as to point of fortune.</P>
<P>All men love women: And find me a man of more honour in the&s;e points, if you can, Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>No wonder the Sex love me as they do!</P>
<P>But <HI>now</HI> I am &s;trictly virtuous. I am reformed. So I have been for a long, long time: Re&s;olving to marry, as &s;oon as I can prevail upon the mo&s;t admira|ble of women to have me. I think of nobody el&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould. I have &s;pared very pretty girls for her &s;ake. Very true, Jo&s;eph! So &s;et your hone&s;t heart at re&s;t&mdash;You &s;ee the pains I take to &s;atisfy your qualms.</P>
<P>But as to Mi&s;s Betterton&mdash;No Rape in the ca&s;e, I repeat: Rapes are unnatural things: And more <HI>rare</HI> than are imagined, Jo&s;eph&mdash;I &s;hould be loth to be put to &s;uch a &s;treight. I never was. Mi&s;s Betterton was taken from me again&s;t her own will. In that ca&s;e, her friends, not I, committed the Rape.</P>
<P>I have contrived to &s;ee the Boy twice, unknown to the Aunt, who takes care of him; loves him; and would not now part with him, on any con&s;ideration. The Boy is a fine Boy, I thank God. No Father need be a&s;hamed of him. He will be well provided for. If not, I would take care of him. He will have his Mother's fortune. They cur&s;e the Father, un|grateful wretches! but ble&s;s the Boy&mdash;Upon the whole, there is nothing vile in this matter on my &s;ide; a great deal on the Bettertons.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Jo&s;eph, be not thou in pain, either
<PB N="53" REF="62">
for <HI>my</HI> head, or for <HI>thy own</HI> neck; nor for the Blue Boar; nor for thy pretty Sow.&mdash;</P>
<P>I love your je&s;ting. Je&s;ting better becomes a poor man than qualms.&mdash;I love to have you je&s;t. All we &s;ay, all we do, all we wi&s;h for, is a je&s;t. He that makes life it&s;elf not &s;o, is a &s;ad fellow, and has the wor&s;t of it.</P>
<P>I doubt not, Jo&s;eph, but you have had your joys, as you &s;ay, as well as your betters. May you have more and more, hone&s;t Jo&s;eph!&mdash;He that grudges a poor man joy, ought to have none him&s;elf. Je&s;t on therefore: Je&s;ting, I repeat, better becomes thee than qualms.</P>
<P>I had no <HI>need</HI> to tell you of Mi&s;s Betterton: Did I not furni&s;h you with &s;tories enough without hers, again&s;t my&s;elf, to augment your credit with your cunning ma&s;ters? Be&s;ides, I was loth to mention Mi&s;s Better|ton, her friends being all living, and in credit. I loved her too; for &s;he was taken from me by her cruel friends while our joys were young.</P>
<P>But enough of dear Mi&s;s Betterton. <HI>Dear,</HI> I &s;ay; for death <HI>endears.</HI>&mdash;Re&s;t to her worthy &s;oul!&mdash;There, Jo&s;eph, off went a deep &s;igh to the memory of Mi&s;s Betterton!</P>
<P>As to the journey of little Titus [I now recollect the fellow by his name] Let that take its cour&s;e: A Lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no pro|ce&s;s begun in her life-time; refu&s;ing her&s;elf to give evidence again&s;t me whil&s;t &s;he lived&mdash;Pretty circum|&s;tances to found an indictment for a Rape upon!</P>
<P>As to your young Lady, the ever-adorable Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, I always courted her for a Wife. Others rather expected marriage from the vanity of their own hearts, than from my promi&s;es. For I was always careful of what I promi&s;ed. You know, Jo|&s;eph, that I have gone beyond my promi&s;es to <HI>you.</HI> I do to every-body: And why? Becau&s;e it is the be&s;t way of &s;hewing, that I have no grudging or narrow
<PB N="54" REF="63">
&s;pirit. A promi&s;e is an obligation. <HI>A ju&s;t man will keep his promi&s;e: A generous man will go beyond it.</HI> This is my rule.</P>
<P>If you doubt my honour to your young Lady, it is more than &s;he does. She would not &s;tay with me an hour if &s;he did. Mine is the &s;teadie&s;t heart in the world. Ha&s;t thou not rea&s;on to think it &s;o?&mdash;Why this &s;queami&s;hne&s;s then, hone&s;t Jo&s;eph?</P>
<P>But it is becau&s;e thou <HI>art</HI> hone&s;t: So I forgive thee. Whoever loves my divine Clari&s;&s;a, loves me.</P>
<P>Let James Harlowe call me what Names he will. For his Si&s;ter's &s;ake I will bear them. Do not be concerned for me. Her favour will make me rich amends. His own vilely malicious heart will make his blood <HI>boil over</HI> at any time: And when it does, thinke&s;t thou that I will let it touch my con&s;cience? &mdash;And if not <HI>mine,</HI> why &s;hould it touch <HI>thine?</HI> Ah! Jo&s;eph, Jo&s;eph! What a fooli&s;h teazer is thy con|&s;cience! Such a con&s;cience, as gives a plain man trouble, when he intends to do for the be&s;t, is weak|ne&s;s, not con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But &s;ay what thou wilt, write all thou knowe&s;t or heare&s;t of, to me: Ill have patience with every|body. Why &s;hould I not, when it is as much the de|&s;ire of my heart, as it is of thine, to prevent mi&s;|chief?</P>
<P>So now, Jo&s;eph, having taken all this pains to &s;a|tisfy thy Con&s;cience, and an&s;wer all thy doubts, and to bani&s;h all thy fears; let me come to a <HI>new point.</HI></P>
<P>Your endeavours and mine, which were de&s;igned, <HI>by round-about ways,</HI> to reconcile all, even again&s;t the wills of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, have not, we &s;ee, an|&s;wered the end we hoped they would an&s;wer; but, on the contrary, have widened the unhappy differences between our families. But this has not been either your fault or mine: It is owing to the black pitch-like blood of your venomous-hearted young Ma&s;ter, <HI>boiling over,</HI> as he owns, that our hone&s;t wi&s;hes have hitherto been fru&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64">Yet we mu&s;t proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e: We &s;hall tire them out in time, and they will propo&s;e terms; and when they do, they &s;hall find how rea|&s;onable mine &s;hall be, little as they de&s;erve from me.</P>
<P>Per&s;evere, therefore, Jo&s;eph; hone&s;t Jo&s;eph, per|&s;evere; and, unlikely as you may imagine the means, our de&s;ires will be at la&s;t obtained.</P>
<P>We have nothing for it now, but to go thro' with our work in the way we have begun. For &s;ince (as I told you in my la&s;t) my Beloved mi&s;tru&s;ts you, &s;he will blow you up, if &s;he be <HI>not</HI> mine. If &s;he <HI>be,</HI> I can and will protect you; and as, if there will be any fault, in her opinion, it will be rather mine than yours, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> forgive you, and keep her hu&s;band' &s;ecrets, for the &s;ake of his reputation: El&s;e &s;he will be guilty of a great failure in her duty. So, now you have &s;et your hand to the plough, Jo&s;eph, there is no looking back.</P>
<P>And what is the con&s;equence of all this? One la|bour more, and that will be all that will fall to your lot; at lea&s;t of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>My beloved is re&s;olved not to think of Marriage till &s;he has tried to move her friends to a Reconciliation with her. You know they are determined not to be reconciled. She has it in her head, I doubt not, to make me &s;ubmit to the people I hate; and if I did, they would rather in&s;ult me, than receive my conde|&s;cen&s;ion as they ought. She even owns, that &s;he will renounce me, if they in&s;i&s;t upon it, provided they will give up Solmes. So, to all appearance, I am &s;till as far as ever from the happine&s;s of calling her mine: Indeed I am more likely than ever to lo&s;e her (if I cannot con|trive &s;ome way to avail my&s;elf of the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation); and then, Jo&s;eph, all I have been &s;tu|dying, and all you have been doing, will &s;ignify no|thing.</P>
<P>At the place where we are, we cannot long be private. The lodgings are inconvenient for us, while
<PB N="56" REF="65">
both together, and while the refu&s;es to marry. She wants to get me at a di&s;tance from her. There are extraordinary convenient lodgings in my eye in Lon|don, where we could be private, and all mi&s;chief avoided. When <HI>there</HI> (if I <HI>get</HI> her thither) &s;he will in&s;i&s;t, that I &s;hall leave her. Mi&s;s Howe is for ever putting her upon contrivances. That, you know, is the rea&s;on I have been obliged, by your means, to play the family off at Harlowe-Place upon Mrs. Howe, and Mrs. Howe upon her Daughter&mdash;Ah! Jo&s;eph!&mdash; Little need for your fears for my Angel: <HI>I</HI> only am in danger&mdash;But were I the free liver I am reported to be, all this could I get over with a wet finger, as the &s;aying is.</P>
<P>But, by the help of one of your hints, I have thought of an Expedient which will do every-thing, and rai&s;e your reputation, tho' already &s;o high, higher &s;till. This Singleton, I hear, is a fellow who loves enterpri&s;ing: The view he has to get James Harlowe to be his principal owner in a larger ve&s;&s;el which he wants to be put into the command of, may be the &s;ubject of their pre&s;ent clo&s;e conver&s;ation. But &s;ince he is taught to have &s;o good an opinion of you, Jo&s;eph <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. iii. p. 234&mdash;236. of the fir&s;t Edition, for the Re|mainder of this Letter.</NOTE>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>You a&s;&s;ume, my dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> your u&s;ual and ever-agreeable &s;tyle, in what you write of the two Gentlemen, and how unaptly you think they have cho&s;en; Mr. Hickman in addre&s;&s;ing you; Mr. Love|lace me.

You two might indeed have raqueted the Ball betwixt you, as you &s;ay: But Mr. Hickman, by his gentle manners,
<PB N="58" REF="67">
&s;eems formed for you, if you go not too far with him. If you do, it would be a tamene&s;s in him to bear it, which would make a man more contemptible than Mr. Hickman can ever de&s;erve to be made.

<P>Let me tell you, my dear, that Mr. Hickman is &s;uch a one, as would rather bear an affront <HI>from</HI> a Lady, than offer one <HI>to</HI> her.

<P><HI>Mr. Lovelace in his next Letter gives an account of his quick return: Of his rea&s;ons to the Lady for it: Of
<PB N="63" REF="72">
her di&s;plea&s;ure upon it: And of her urging his ab&s;ence from the &s;afety &s;he was in from the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e, except &s;he were to be traced out by his vi&s;its.</HI></P>
<P>I was confoundedly puzzled, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> on this oc|ca&s;ion, and on her in&s;i&s;ting upon the execution of a too-ready offer which I made her to go down to Berks, to bring up my Cou&s;in Charlotte to vi&s;it and attend her. I made mi&s;erable excu&s;es; and, fearing that they would be mortally re&s;ented, as her pa&s;&s;ion began to ri&s;e upon my &s;aying Charlotte was delicate, which &s;he took &s;trangely wrong, I was obliged to &s;creen my&s;elf behind the mo&s;t &s;olemn and explicit declara|tions.</P>
<P><HI>He then repeats tho&s;e declarations, to the &s;ame effect with the account &s;he gives of them.</HI></P>
<P>I began, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> with an intention to keep my Life of Honour in view, in the declarations I made her; but, as it has been &s;aid of a certain orator in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who more than once, in a long &s;peech, convinced him&s;elf as he went along, and concluded again&s;t the &s;ide he &s;et out intending to favour, &s;o I in earne&s;t pre&s;&s;ed without re&s;erve for Matrimony in the progre&s;s of my harangue, which &s;tate I little thought of urging upon her with &s;o much &s;trength and expli|citne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>He then values him&s;elf upon the delay that his propo&s;al of taking and furni&s;hing a hou&s;e mu&s;t occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He wavers in his re&s;olutions whether to act honourably or not, by a merit &s;o exalted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He values him&s;elf upon his own delicacy, in expre&s;&s;ing his indignation again&s;t her friends, for &s;uppo&s;ing what he pretends his heart ri&s;es again&s;t them for pre|&s;uming to &s;uppo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But have I not rea&s;on, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to be angry with her, for not prai&s;ing me for this my delicacy, when &s;he
<PB N="64" REF="73">
is &s;o ready to call me to account for the lea&s;t failure in punctilio? However, I believe I can excu&s;e her too, upon this generous con&s;ideration [For <HI>generous</HI> I am &s;ure it is, becau&s;e it is again&s;t my&s;elf]; that her mind being the e&s;&s;ence of delicacy, the lea&s;t want of it &s;hocks her; while the meeting with what is &s;o very extra|ordinary to <HI>me,</HI> is too familiar to <HI>her</HI> to obtain her notice, <HI>as</HI> an extraordinary.</P>
<P><HI>He glories in the &s;tory of the hou&s;e, and of the young Widow po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, Mrs. Fretchville he calls her; and leaves it doubtful to Mr. Belford, whether it be a real or fictitious &s;tory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He mentions his different propo&s;als in relation to the Ce|remony, which he &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed for; and owns his artful intention in avoiding to name the day.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I hope &s;oon to have an oppor|tunity to begin my operations; &s;ince all is <HI>Halcyon</HI> and Security.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the dear Creature's &s;weet and &s;ilent confu&s;ion, when I touched upon the matri|monial topics.</P>
<P>She <HI>may</HI> doubt. She <HI>may</HI> fear. The wi&s;e in all important ca&s;es will doubt, and will fear, till they are &s;ure. But her apparent willingne&s;s to think well of a &s;pirit &s;o inventive and &s;o machinating, is a happy progno&s;tic for me. O the&s;e rea&s;oning Ladies!&mdash; How I love the&s;e rea&s;oning Ladies!&mdash;'Tis all over with them, when once Love has crept into their hearts: For then will they employ all their rea&s;oning powers to <HI>excu&s;e,</HI> rather than to <HI>blame,</HI> the conduct of the <HI>doubted</HI> Lover, let appearances again&s;t him be ever &s;o &s;trong.</P>

the Widow and Nieces, from the knowlege they had of the Colonel. They will not forbear familiarities of &s;peech to the Mother, as of longer acquaintance than a day. So I have &s;uited their parts to their capacities.</P>
<P>They may prai&s;e the Widow and the Colonel for people of great honour&mdash;But not too gro&s;ly; nor to labour the point &s;o as to render them&s;elves &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The Mother will lead ye into her own and the Colonel's prai&s;es; and Tourville and Mowbray may be both her vouchers&mdash;I, and you, and Belton, mu&s;t be only hear&s;ay confirmers.</P>

She will propo&s;e to do hand&s;ome things by her two Nieces. Sally is near Marriage&mdash; with an eminent Woolen-draper in the Strand, if ye have a mind to it; for there are five or &s;ix of them there.</P>
<P>The Nieces may be enquired after, &s;ince they will be ab&s;ent, as per&s;ons re&s;pected by Mowbray and Tourville, for their late worthy Uncle's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Watch ye diligently every turn of my counte|rance; every motion of my eye; for in my eye, and in my countenance, will ye find a &s;overeign re|gulator. I need not bid ye re&s;pect me mightily: Your allegiance obliges ye to that: And who that &s;ees me, re&s;pects me not?</P>
<P>Pri&s;cilla Partington (for her looks &s;o innocent, and di&s;cretion &s;o deep, yet &s;eeming &s;o &s;oftly) may be greatly relied upon.

<P><PB N="67" REF="76">Mi&s;s Partington's hi&s;tory is this: The Daughter of Col.

<P>She is ju&s;t come to pa&s;s a day or two, and then to return to her &s;urviving guardian's at Barnet.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Partington has &s;uitors a little hundred (her Grandmother, an Alderman's Dowager, having left her a great additional fortune); and is not tru&s;ted out of her guardians hou&s;e, without an old gouver|nante noted for di&s;cretion, except to her Mamma Sinclair; with whom now-and-then &s;he is permitted to be for a week together.</P>
<P>Pri&s;c. will Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair, and will under|take to court her guardian to let her pa&s;s a delightful week with her&mdash;Sir Edward Holden, he may as well be, if your &s;hallow pates will not be clogged with too many circum&s;tantials. Lady Holden perhaps will come with her; for &s;he always delighted in her Mam|ma Sinclair's company; and talks of her, and her good management, twenty times a day.</P>
<P>Be it principally thy part, Jack, who art a parade|ing fellow, and aime&s;t at wi&s;dom, to keep thy bro|ther-varlets from blundering; for, as thou mu&s;t have ob&s;erved from what I have written, we have the mo&s;t watchful and mo&s;t penetrating Lady in the world to deal with: A Lady worth deceiving!

And as to <HI>us,</HI> our work will be the ea&s;ier; our &s;ins the fewer: Since they will draw them&s;elves in with a very little of our help; and we &s;hall &s;ave a parcel of cur&s;ed Fal&s;hoods, and appear to be what we <HI>are</HI> both to Angels and Men.

<P>Be &s;ure to in&s;truct the re&s;t, and do thou thy&s;elf remember, not to talk ob&s;cenely. You know I ne|ver permitted any of you to talk ob&s;cenely.

Far from ob&s;cenity therefore, do not &s;o much as touch upon the double Entendre. What! as I have often &s;aid, cannot you touch a Lady's heart, without wounding her ear?</P>
<P>It is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> that ye &s;hould appear wor&s;e men than my&s;elf. You cannot help appearing &s;o, you'll &s;ay.

<P>I HAVE carried my third point; but &s;o extremely to the di&s;like of my Charmer, that I have been threatened, for &s;uffering Mi&s;s Partington to be in|troduced to her without her leave. Which laid her under a nece&s;&s;ity to deny or comply with the urgent reque&s;t of &s;o fine a young Lady; who had engaged to honour me at my Collation, on condition that my Beloved would be pre&s;ent at it.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79">To be obliged to appear before my friends as what &s;he was not! She was for in&s;i&s;ting, that I &s;hould ac|quaint the women here with the truth of the matter; and not go on propagating &s;tories for her to counte|nance; making her a &s;harer in my guilt.</P>
<P>But what points will not per&s;everance carry? e&s;pe|cially when it is covered over with the face of yield|ing now, and Parthian-like returning to the charge anon. Do not the Sex carry all their points with their men by the &s;ame methods? Have I conver&s;ed with them &s;o freely as I have done, and learnt no|thing of them? Did&s;t thou ever know that a woman's denial of any favour, whether the lea&s;t or the greate&s;t, that my heart was &s;et upon, &s;tood her in any &s;tead? The more perver&s;e &s;he, the more &s;teady I; that is my rule.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But the point thus &s;o much again&s;t her will carried, I doubt thou wilt &s;ee in her more of a &s;ullen than of an obliging Charmer. For when Mi&s;s Partington was withdrawn,
What was Mi&s;s Partington to her? In her &s;ituation &s;he wanted no new acquaintance. And what were my four friends to her in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances? She would a&s;&s;ure me, if ever again"</Q>&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt, with a twirl of her hand.</P>
<P>When we meet, I will, in her pre&s;ence, tipping thee a wink, &s;hew thee the motion; for it was a very pretty one. Quite new. Yet have I &s;een an hundred pretty pa&s;&s;ionate twirls too, in my time, from other Fair-ones. How univer&s;ally engaging it is to put a woman of &s;en&s;e, to whom a man is not married, in a pa&s;&s;ion, let the reception given to every ranting &s;cene in our Plays te&s;tify.

<Q><P>MR. Lovelace in his la&s;t Letters having taken notice of the mo&s;t material pa&s;&s;ages contained in this Let|ter, the following Extracts from it are only in&s;erted.</P>
<P>She gives pretty near the &s;ame account that he does of what pa&s;&s;ed between them, on her re&s;olution to go to church; and of his propo&s;al of St. Paul's, and de&s;ire of attending her. She prai&s;es his good behaviour there; as al&s;o the di&s;cour&s;e, and the preacher: Is plea&s;ed with its &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s: Gives particulars of the conver&s;ation between them afterwards, and com|mends the good ob&s;ervations he makes upon the &s;ermon.</P></Q>
<P>I am willing, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> to have hopes of him: But am &s;o unable to know how to depend upon his &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s for an hour together, that all my favourable accounts of him in this re&s;pect mu&s;t be taken with allowance.</P>
<P>Being very much pre&s;&s;ed, I could not tell how to refu&s;e dining with the Widow and her Nieces this day. I am better plea&s;ed with them, than I ever thought I &s;hould be. I cannot help blaming my&s;elf for my rea|dine&s;s to give &s;evere cen&s;ures, where reputation is concerned. Peoples ways, humours, con&s;titutions, education, and opportunities allowed for, my dear, many per&s;ons, as far as I know, may appear blamele&s;s, whom others of different humours and educations are
<PB N="72" REF="81">
too apt to blame; and who, from the &s;ame fault, may be as ready to blame <HI>them.</HI> I will therefore make it a rule to my&s;elf for the future, never to judge peremptorily on fir&s;t appearances: But yet I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that the&s;e are not people I &s;hould chu&s;e to be intimate with, or who&s;e ways I can like: Altho', for the &s;tations they are in, they may go thro' the world with tolerable credit.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace's behaviour has been &s;uch, as makes me call this, &s;o far as it is pa&s;&s;ed, an agreeable day. Yet when ea&s;ie&s;t as to him, my &s;ituation with my friends takes place in my thoughts, and cau&s;es me many a tear.</P>
<P>I am the more plea&s;ed with the people of the hou&s;e, becau&s;e of the per&s;ons of rank they are acquainted with, and who vi&s;it them.</P>

<P>I AM &s;till well plea&s;ed with Mr. Lovelace's beha|viour. We have had a good deal of &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e together. The man has really ju&s;t and good notions. He confe&s;&s;es how much he is plea&s;ed with this day, and hopes for many &s;uch. Neverthele&s;s, he inge|nuou&s;ly warned me, that his unlucky vivacity might return: But he doubted not, that he &s;hould be fixed at la&s;t by my example and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>He has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to meet to-morrow night: <HI>Enter|taining,</HI> I mean, for his humorous de&s;cription of their per&s;ons, manners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but &s;uch a de&s;cription as is far from being to their prai&s;e: Yet he &s;eemed rather to de&s;ign to divert my melancholy it, than to de|grade them. I think at bottom, my dear, that he mu&s;t be a good-natured man; but that he was &s;poiled young for want of check or controul.</P>
<P>I cannot but call this, my circum&s;tances con&s;idered, an happy day to the end of it. Indeed, my dear, I think I could prefer him to all the men I ever knew, were he but to be always what he has been this day.
<PB N="73" REF="82">
You &s;ee how ready I am to own all you have charged me with, when I find my&s;elf out. It is a difficult thing, I believe, &s;ometimes, for a young creature that is able to deliberate with her&s;elf, to know when &s;he loves, or when &s;he hates: But I am re&s;olved, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to be determined both in my hatred and love by <HI>actions,</HI> as <HI>they</HI> make the man worthy or un|worthy.</P>

<P>To pur&s;ue the compari&s;on <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age is in&s;erted Vol. iii. p. 357&mdash;360. of the 2d Edit.</NOTE>&mdash;If the di&s;appoint|ment of the captivated Lady be very great, &s;he will threaten, indeed, as I &s;aid: She will even refu&s;e her &s;u&s;tenance for &s;ome time, e&s;pecially if you entreat her much, and &s;he thinks &s;he gives you concern by her refu&s;al. But then the Stomach of the dear &s;ullen one will &s;oon return. 'Tis pretty to &s;ee how &s;he comes to by degrees: Pre&s;&s;ed by appetite, &s;he will fir&s;t &s;teal, perhaps, a weeping mor&s;el by her&s;elf; then be brought to piddle and &s;igh, and &s;igh and pid|dle, before you; now-and-then, if her viands be un|&s;avoury, &s;wallowing with them a reli&s;hing tear or two: Then &s;he comes to eat and drink, to oblige you: Then re&s;olves to live for your &s;ake: Her ex|clamations will, in the next place, be turned into blandi&s;hments; her vehement upbraidings into gentle murmurings&mdash;How <HI>dare</HI> you, Traitor!&mdash;into How <HI>could</HI> you, deare&s;t? She will draw you to her, in&s;tead of pu&s;hing you from her: No longer, with un&s;heathed claws, will &s;he re&s;i&s;t you; but, like a pretty, playful, wanton Kitten, with gentle paws and concealed ta|lons, tap your cheek, and with intermingled &s;miles, and tears, and care&s;&s;es, implore your con&s;ideration for her, and your <HI>con&s;tancy:</HI> All the favour &s;he then
<PB N="74" REF="83">
has to a&s;k of you!&mdash;And this is the time, were it given to man to confine him&s;elf to one object, to be happier every day than other.</P>
<P>Now, Belford, were I to go no farther than I have gone with my beloved Mi&s;s Harlowe, how &s;hall I know the difference between <HI>her</HI> and <HI>another</HI> bird? To let her fly now, what a pretty je&s;t would that be! How do I know, except I try, whether &s;he may not be brought to &s;ing me a fine &s;ong, and to be as well contented as I have brought other birds to be, and very &s;hy ones too?</P>
<P>But now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures. I can give two or three familiar, and, if they were <HI>not familiar,</HI> they would be <HI>&s;hocking,</HI> in&s;tances of the cruelty both of men and women, with re&s;pect to other creatures, per|haps as worthy as (at lea&s;t more innocent than) them|&s;elves. By my Soul, Jack, there is more of the Sa|vage in human nature than we are commonly aware of. Nor is it, after all, &s;o much ami&s;s, that we &s;ometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon our own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>To particulars.</P>
<P>How u&s;ual a thing is it for women as well as men, without the lea&s;t remor&s;e, to en&s;nare, to cage, and torment, and even with burning knitting-needles to put out the eyes of the poor feather'd &s;ong&s;ter [Thou &s;ee&s;t I have not yet done with birds]; which however, in proportion to its bulk, has more life than them|&s;elves (for a bird is all &s;oul) and of con&s;equence has as much feeling as the human creature! When at the &s;ame time, if an hone&s;t fellow, by the gentle&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ion, and the &s;ofte&s;t arts, has the good luck to pre|vail upon a mew'd-up lady to countenance her own e&s;cape, and &s;he con&s;ents to break cage, and be &s;et a flying into the all-chearing air of liberty, Mercy on us! what an Outcry is generally rai&s;ed again&s;t him!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t like what you and I once &s;aw rai&s;ed in a paltry
<PB N="75" REF="84">
village near Chelmsford, after a poor hungry fox, who, watching his opportunity, had &s;eized by the neck, and &s;houldered, a &s;leek-feathered goo&s;e: At what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls, old men, and old women, all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time; the old men armed with prongs, pitch-forks, clubs, and cat&s;ticks; the old women with mops, brooms, fire-&s;hovels, tongs, and pokers; and the younger fry with dirt, &s;tones, and brickbats, gathering as they ran like a &s;nowball, in pur&s;uit of the wind-out&s;tripping prowler; all the mongrel curs of the <HI>cir|cumjacencies</HI> yelp, yelp, yelp, at their heels, com|pleting the horrid chorus.</P>
<P>Remembre&s;t thou not this &s;cene? Surely thou mu&s;t. My imagination, inflamed by a tender &s;ym|pathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder, repre&s;ents it to my eye, as if it were but ye&s;terday. And do&s;t thou not recollect how generou&s;ly glad we were, as if our own ca&s;e, that hone&s;t Reynard, by the help of a lucky &s;tile, over which both old and young tumbled upon one another, and a winding cour&s;e, e&s;caped their brutal fury, and flying cat&s;ticks; and how, in fancy, we followed him to his undi&s;co|vered retreat; and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying his dear-earned purcha&s;e with a delight proportioned to his pa&s;t danger?</P>
<P>I once made a charming little &s;avage &s;everely repent the delight &s;he took in &s;eeing her tabby favourite make cruel &s;port with a pretty &s;leek bead-eyed mou&s;e, be|fore &s;he devoured it. Egad, my Love, &s;aid I to my|&s;elf, as I &s;at meditating the &s;cene, I am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how <HI>thou</HI> wilt like to be to&s;t over <HI>my</HI> head, and be caught again: How <HI>thou</HI> wilt like to be patted from me, and pulled to me. Yet will I rather give life than take it away, as this barbarous quadrupede has at la&s;t done by her prey. And after all was over between my girl and
<PB N="76" REF="85">
me, I reminded her of the incident to which my re|&s;olution was owing.</P>
<P>Nor had I at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old Epicure, who had taught the girl, without the lea&s;t remor&s;e, to roa&s;t Lob&s;ters alive; to cau&s;e a poor Pig to be whipt to death, to &s;crape Carp the contrary way of the &s;cales, making them leap in the &s;tew-pan, and dre&s;&s;ing them in their own blood for &s;awce. And this for luxury-&s;ake, and to provoke an appetite; which I had without &s;timulation, in my way, and that I can tell thee a very ravenous one.</P>
<P>Many more in&s;tances of the like nature could I give, were I to leave nothing to thy&s;elf, to &s;hew that the be&s;t take the &s;ame liberties, and perhaps wor&s;e, with &s;ome &s;ort of creatures, that we take with others; all <HI>creatures</HI> &s;till! and creatures too, as I have ob&s;erved above, replete with &s;trong life, and &s;en&s;ible feeling!&mdash; If therefore people pretend to mercy, let mercy go thro' all their actions. I have read &s;omewhere, <HI>That a merciful man is merciful to his bea&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>O my dear! he is a fierce, a fooli&s;h, an in&s;olent creature!&mdash;And in truth, I hardly expect, that we <HI>can</HI> accommodate. How much unhappier am I al|ready with him, than my Mother ever was with my Father after marriage! Since (and that without any rea&s;on, any pretence in the world for it) he is for breaking my &s;pirit <HI>before</HI> I am his; and while I am, or ought to be [O my folly, that I am not!] in my own power.</P>
<P>Till I can know whether my friends will give me hope or not, I mu&s;t do what I never &s;tudied to do before in any ca&s;e; that is, to try to keep this differ|ence open: And yet it will make me look <HI>little in my own eyes</HI>; becau&s;e I &s;hall mean by it more than I can own. But this is one of the con&s;equences of a &s;tep I &s;hall ever deplore! The natural fruits of all engage|ments, where the minds are unpaired&mdash;<HI>di&s;-paired,</HI> in my ca&s;e may I &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91">Let this evermore be my caution to individuals of my Sex&mdash;Guard your eye: 'Twill ever be in a com|bination again&s;t your judgment. If there are two parts to be taken, it will for ever, traitor as it is, take the wrong one.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k me, my dear, How this caution befits me? let me tell you a &s;ecret which I have but very lately found out upon &s;elf-examination, altho' you &s;eem to have made the di&s;covery long ago; That had not my fooli&s;h eye been too much attached, I had not taken the pains to attempt, &s;o officiou&s;ly as I did, the prevention of mi&s;chief between him and &s;ome of my family, which fir&s;t induced the corre&s;pondence be|tween us, and was the occa&s;ion of bringing the ap|prehended mi&s;chief with double weight upon my&s;elf. My vanity and conceit, as far as I know, might have part in the incon&s;iderate mea&s;ure: For does it not look as if I thought my&s;elf more capable of obviating difficulties, than any-body el&s;e of my family?</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not, my dear, &s;uppo&s;e my heart to be &s;till a confederate with my eye. That deluded eye now clearly &s;ees its fault, and the mi&s;led heart de&s;pi&s;es it for it. Hence the application I am making to my Uncle: Hence it is, that I can &s;ay (I think truly) that I would atone for my fault at any rate, even by the &s;acrifice of a limb or two, if that would do.</P>

<P>Even Dorcas, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> appears le&s;s exceptionable to me than before, and I cannot but pity her for her neglected education, as it is matter of &s;o much regret to <HI>her&s;elf:</HI> El&s;e, there would not be much in it; as the Low and Illiterate are the mo&s;t u&s;eful people in the commonwealth (&s;ince &s;uch con&s;titute the labouring part of the public); and as a Lettered Education but too generally &s;ets people above tho&s;e &s;ervile offices, by which the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world is carried on. Nor have I any doubt, that there are, take the world thro', twenty happy people among the Unlettered, to one among tho&s;e who have had a School Education.</P>
<P>This, however, concludes not again&s;t Learning or

Letters; &s;ince one would wi&s;h to lift to &s;ome little di&s;tinction, and more genteel u&s;efulne&s;s, tho&s;e who have capacity, and who&s;e Parentage one re&s;pects, or who&s;e &s;ervices one would wi&s;h to reward.</P>
<P>Were my mind quite at ea&s;e, I could enlarge, per|haps not unu&s;efully, upon this &s;ubject; for I have con&s;idered it with as much attention as my years, and little experience and ob&s;ervation, will permit.</P>
<P>But the extreme illiteratene&s;s and indocility of this maid are &s;urpri&s;ing, con&s;idering that &s;he wants not in|qui&s;itivene&s;s, appears willing to learn, and, in other re&s;pects, has quick parts. This confirms to me what I have heard remarked, That there is a <HI>docible Sea&s;on,</HI> a Learning-time, as I may &s;ay, for every per&s;on, in which the mind may be led &s;tep by &s;tep, from the lower to the higher (year by year) to improvement. How indu&s;triou&s;ly ought the&s;e Sea&s;ons, as they offer, to be taken hold of, by Tutors, Parents, and other friends, to whom the cultivation of the genius of chil|dren and youth is committed; &s;ince, once elap&s;ed, and no foundation laid, they hardly ever return!&mdash; And yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there are &s;ome ge|nius's, which, like &s;ome fruits, ripen not till late. And Indu&s;try and Per&s;everance will do prodigious things&mdash;But for a learner to have tho&s;e fir&s;t rudiments to ma&s;ter, at twenty years of age &s;uppo&s;e, which others are taught, and they them&s;elves might have at|tained, at ten, what an up-hill labour!</P>
<P>The&s;e kind of ob&s;ervations you have always wi&s;hed me to inter&s;per&s;e, as they ari&s;e to my thoughts. But it is a &s;ign that my pro&s;pects are a little mended, or I &s;hould not, among &s;o many more intere&s;ting ones, that my mind has been of late filled with, have had heart's-ea&s;e enough to make them.</P>
<P>Let me give you my <HI>reflections</HI> on my more hopeful pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>I am now, in the fir&s;t place, better able to account for the delays about the hou&s;e, than I was before&mdash;
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Poor Mrs. Fretchville!&mdash;Tho' I know her not, I pity her!&mdash;Next, it looks well, that he had appri&s;ed the women (before this conver&s;ation with them) of his in|tention to &s;tay in this hou&s;e, after I was removed to the other. By the tone of his voice he &s;eemed con|cerned for the appearance this new delay would have with me.</P>
<P>So hand&s;omely did Mi&s;s Martin expre&s;s her&s;elf of me, that I am &s;orry, methinks, that I judged &s;o hardly of her, when I fir&s;t came hither&mdash;Free people may go a great way, but not all the way: And as &s;uch are generally unguarded, precipitate, and thought|le&s;s, the &s;ame quickne&s;s, changeablene&s;s, and <HI>&s;udden|ne&s;s</HI> of &s;pirit, as I may call it, may intervene (if the heart be not corrupted) to recover them to thought and duty.</P>
<P>His rea&s;on for declining to go in per&s;on to bring up the Ladies of his family, while my Brother and Sin|gleton continue their machinations, carries no bad face with it; and one may the rather allow for <HI>their</HI> ex|pectations, that &s;o proud a &s;pirit as his &s;hould attend them for this purpo&s;e, as he &s;peaks of them &s;ometimes as per&s;ons of punctilio.</P>
<P>Other rea&s;ons I will mention for my being ea&s;ier in my mind than I was before I overheard this conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>Such as, the advice he has received in relation to Singleton's mate; which agrees but too well with what you, my dear, wrote to me in yours of May the 10th.</P>
<P>His not intending to acquaint <HI>me</HI> with it.</P>
<P>His cautions to the &s;ervants about the &s;ailor, if he &s;hould come, and make enquiries about us.</P>
<P>His re&s;olution to avoid violence, were he to fall in either with my Brother, or this Singleton; and the ea&s;y method he has chalked out, in this ca&s;e, to pre|vent mi&s;chief; &s;ince I need only <HI>not to deny</HI> my being his. But yet I &s;hould be exceedingly unhappy in my
<PB N="93" REF="102">
own opinion, to be driven into &s;uch a tacit acknow|legement to any new per&s;ons, till I am &s;o, altho' I have been led (&s;o much again&s;t my liking) to give countenance to the belief of the per&s;ons below that we are married.</P>
<P>I think my&s;elf obliged, from what pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Lovelace and me on Wedne&s;day, and from what I overheard him &s;ay, to con&s;ent to go with him to the Play; and the rather, as he had the di&s;cretion to pro|po&s;e one of the Nieces to accompany me.</P>
<P>I cannot but acknowlege that I am plea&s;ed to find, that he has actually written to Lord M.</P>
<P>I have promi&s;ed to give Mr. Lovelace an an&s;wer to his propo&s;als as &s;oon as I have heard from you, my dear, on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I hope that in my next Letter I &s;hall have rea&s;on to confirm the&s;e favourable appearances. Favourable I mu&s;t think them in the wreck I have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>I hope, that in the trial which you hint may happen between <HI>me</HI> and <HI>my&s;elf</HI> (as you <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 87.</NOTE> expre&s;s it) if he &s;hould &s;o behave, as to oblige me to leave him, I &s;hall be able to act in &s;uch a manner, as to bring no di&s;|credit upon my&s;elf in your eye; and that is all now that I have to wi&s;h for. But if I value him &s;o much as you are plea&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e I do, the trial which you imagine will be &s;o difficult to me, will not, I con|ceive, be upon getting from him, when the means to effect my e&s;cape are lent me; but how I &s;hall behave when got from him; and if, like the I&s;raelites of old, I &s;hall be &s;o weak as to wi&s;h to return to my Egyptian bondage.</P>
<P>I think it will not be ami&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent favourable appearances, that you &s;hould perfect the &s;cheme (whatever it be) which you tell me you have thought of, in order to procure for me an a&s;ylum, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. Mr. Lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous man; and it is therefore but prudence
<PB N="94" REF="103">
to be watchful; and to be provided again&s;t the wor&s;t. Lord ble&s;s me, my dear, how am I reduced!&mdash;Could I ever have thought to be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to be obliged to &s;tay with a man, of who&s;e honour by me I could have but the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of a doubt!&mdash;But I will look forward, and hope the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I am certain, that your Letters are &s;afe.&mdash;Be per|fectly ea&s;y, therefore, on that head.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace will never be out of my company by his good-will; otherwi&s;e I have no doubt that I am mi&s;tre&s;s of my goings-out and comings-in; and did I think it needful, and were I not afraid of my Brother, and Capt, Singleton, I would oftener put it to trial.</P>

<P>AND now, that my Beloved &s;eems &s;ecure in my net, for my project upon the vixen Mi&s;s Howe, and upon her Mother: In which the officious prancer Hickman is to come in for a da&s;h.</P>
<P>But why upon her Mother, methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t; who, unknown to her&s;elf, has only acted, by thy im|pul&s;e, thro' thy agent Jo&s;eph Leman, upon the folly of old Tony the Uncle?</P>

<P>I have already broken the matter to our three con|federates; as a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> not a <HI>re&s;olved-on</HI> ca&s;e indeed. And yet they know, that with me, in a piece of mi&s;|chief, Execution, with its &s;wifte&s;t feet, is &s;eldom three paces behind Projection, which hardly ever limps neither.</P>
<P>MOWBRAY is not again&s;t it. It is a &s;cheme, he &s;ays, worthy of us: And we have not done any-thing for a good while, that has made a noi&s;e.</P>
<P>BELTON indeed he&s;itates a little, becau&s;e matters go wrong between him and his Thoma&s;ine; and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his &s;ore place probed to the bottom.</P>
<P>TOURVILLE has &s;tarted a fre&s;h game, and &s;hrugs his &s;houlders, and &s;hould not <HI>chu&s;e</HI> to go abroad at pre|&s;ent, <HI>if I plea&s;e.</HI> For I apprehend that (from the <HI>na|ture</HI> of the project) there will be a kind of nece&s;&s;ity to travel, till all is blown over.</P>

<P>As for THEE, we had rather have thy company than not; for, altho' thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance, yet art thou intrepid at execution.

<P>The project, in &s;hort, is this:&mdash;Mrs. Howe has an elder Si&s;ter in the I&s;le of Wight, who is lately a wi|dow; and I am well informed, that the Mother and Daughter have engaged, before the latter is married, to pay a vi&s;it to this Lady, who is rich, and intends Mi&s;s for her heire&s;s; and in the interim will make her &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents on her approaching Nup|tials; which, as Mrs. Howe, who loves money more than any-thing but her&s;elf, told one of my acquaint|ance, would be <HI>worth fetching.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Jack, nothing more need be done, than to hire a little trim ve&s;&s;el, which &s;hall &s;ail a plea&s;uring backward and forward to Port&s;mouth, Spithead, and the I&s;le of Wight, for a week or fortnight before we enter upon our parts of the plot. And as Mrs. Howe will be for making the be&s;t bargain &s;he can for her pa&s;&s;age, the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el may have orders (as a

<P>Let me tell thee, Jack, I &s;ee not why (to judge according to our principles and practices) we &s;hould not be as much elated in our march, were this to hap|pen to us, as others may be upon any other the mo&s;t <HI>mob-attracting</HI> occa&s;ion&mdash;Suppo&s;e a Lord Mayor on his <HI>Gawdy</HI>; &s;uppo&s;e a victorious General, or Emba&s;|&s;ador, on his public Entry&mdash;Suppo&s;e (as I began with the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI>) the <HI>grande&s;t</HI> parade that can be &s;uppo&s;ed, a Coronation&mdash;For, in all the&s;e, do not the royal guard, the heroic trained-bands, the pendent, clinging throngs of &s;pectators, with their waving heads rolling to-and-fro from hou&s;e-tops to hou&s;e-bottoms and &s;treet-ways, as I have above de&s;cribed, make the prin|cipal part of the Raree-&s;hew?</P>

<P>The principal difference that &s;trikes me in the com|pari&s;on between us and the Mayor, the Emba&s;&s;ador, the General, on <HI>their</HI> Gawdies, is, that the mob make a greater noi&s;e, a louder huzzaing, in the one ca&s;e than in the other, which is called <HI>acclamation,</HI> and ends frequently in <HI>higher</HI> ta&s;te, by throwing dead ani|mals at one another, before they di&s;per&s;e; in which they have as much joy, as in the former part of the triumph: While they will attend us with all the marks of an awful or &s;ilent (at mo&s;t only a whi&s;pering) re|&s;pect; their mouths di&s;tended, as if &s;et open with gags, and their voices generally lo&s;t in goggle-eyed ad|miration.</P>

even the wor&s;t, that two or three were to die, have we not a chance, each man of us, to e&s;cape? The devil's in 'em, if they'll hang Five for ravi&s;hing Three!</P>

<P>So thou &s;ee&s;t the wor&s;t that can happen, &s;hould we <HI>not</HI> make the Grand Tour upon this occa&s;ion, but &s;tay and take our tryals. But it is mo&s;t likely, that they will not pro&s;ecute at all.

<P>This, Jack, is my &s;cheme, at the fir&s;t running.

<P>But let me give thee a few particulars of our con|ver&s;ation in the <HI>circumrotation</HI> we took, while in the coach&mdash;She had received a Letter from Mi&s;s Howe ye&s;terday, I pre&s;umed?</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer. How happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf to be admitted into their corre&s;pondence! I would joyfully make an exchange of communications.</P>
<P>So, tho' I hoped not to &s;ucceed by her con&s;ent [and little did &s;he think I had &s;o happily in part &s;uccecded without it] I thought it not ami&s;s to urge for it, for &s;everal rea&s;ons: Among others, that I might account
<PB N="109" REF="118">
to her for my con&s;tant employment at my pen; in order to take off her jealou&s;y, that <HI>&s;he</HI> was the &s;ubject of thy corre&s;pondence and mine: And that I might ju&s;tify <HI>my</HI> &s;ecrecy and <HI>uncommunicativene&s;s</HI> by her <HI>own.</HI></P>
<P>I proceeded therefore&mdash;That I loved Familiar-let|ter-writing, as I had more than once told her, above all the &s;pecies of writing: It was writing from the heart (without the fetters pre&s;cribed by method or &s;tudy) as the very word <HI>Cor-re&s;pondence</HI> implied. Not the heart only; the <HI>&s;oul</HI> was in it. Nothing of body, when friend writes to friend; the mind impelling &s;o|vereignly, the va&s;&s;al-fingers. It was, in &s;hort, friend|&s;hip recorded; friend&s;hip given under hand and &s;eal; demon&s;trating that the parties were under no appre|hen&s;ion of changing from time or accident, when they &s;o liberally gave te&s;timonies, which would always be ready, on failure, or infidelity, to be turned again&s;t them.&mdash;For my own part, it was the principal diver|&s;ion I had in her ab&s;ence: But for this innocent amu&s;ement, the di&s;tance &s;he &s;o frequently kept me at, would have been intolerable.</P>
<P>Sally knew my drift; and &s;aid, She had had the ho|nour to &s;ee two or three of my letters, and of Mr. Belford's; and &s;he thought them the mo&s;t entertain|ing that &s;he had ever read.</P>
<P>My friend Belford, I &s;aid, had a happy talent in the Letter-writing way; and upon all &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I expected my Beloved would have been inqui&s;itive after our &s;ubjects: But (lying perdue, as I &s;aw) not a word &s;aid &s;he. So I touched upon this article my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our topics were various and diffu&s;e: Sometimes upon literary articles [She was very attentive upon this]; &s;ometimes upon the public entertainments; &s;ometimes amu&s;ing each other with the fruits of the different corre&s;pondencies we held with per&s;ons abroad, with whom we had contracted friend&s;hips; &s;ometimes upon the foibles and perfections of our particular friends; &s;ometimes upon our own pre&s;ent and future

hopes; &s;ometimes aiming at humour and raillery upon each other&mdash;It might indeed appear to &s;avour of va|nity, to &s;uppo&s;e my Letters would entertain a Lady of her delicacy and judgment: But yet I could not but &s;ay, that perhaps &s;he would be far from thinking &s;o hardly of me as &s;ometimes &s;he had &s;eemed to do, if &s;he were to &s;ee the Letters which generally pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Mr. Belford and me [I hope, Jack, thou ha&s;t more manners, than to give me the lye, tho' but in thy heart].</P>
<P>She then &s;poke: After declining my compliment in &s;uch a manner, as only a per&s;on could do, who de|&s;erved it, &s;he &s;aid, For her part, &s;he had always thought me a man of &s;en&s;e [A man of &s;en&s;e, Jack! What a niggardly prai&s;e!]&mdash;And &s;hould therefore hope, that, when I wrote, it exceeded even my &s;peech: For that it was impo&s;&s;ible, be the Letters written in as ea&s;y and familiar a &s;tyle as they would, but that they mu&s;t have that advantage from &s;itting down to write them which prompt &s;peech could not always have. She &s;hould think it very &s;trange, there|fore, if my Letters were barren of &s;entiment; and <HI>as</HI> &s;trange, if I gave my&s;elf liberties upon <HI>premedi|tation,</HI> which could have no excu&s;e at all, but from a thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which it&s;elf wanted excu&s;e.&mdash;But if Mr. Belford's Letters and mine were upon &s;ubjects &s;o general, and &s;ome of them equally (&s;he pre&s;umed) in&s;tructive and entertaining, &s;he could not but &s;ay, that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee any of them; and par|ticularly tho&s;e which Mi&s;s Martin had &s;een, and prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was put clo&s;e.</P>
<P>I looked at her, to &s;ee if I could di&s;cover any tincture of jealou&s;y in this hint; that <HI>Mi&s;s Martin</HI> had &s;een what I had not &s;hewn to <HI>her.</HI> But &s;he did not look it: So I only &s;aid, I &s;hould be very proud to &s;hew her not only tho&s;e, but all that pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Belford and me; but I mu&s;t remind her, that &s;he knew the condition.</P>

<P>She looked at me, as if &s;he would look me thro': I thought I <HI>felt</HI> eye-beam, after eye-beam, penetrate my &s;hivering reins.&mdash;But &s;he was &s;ilent. Nor needed her eyes the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;peech.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, a little recovering my&s;elf, I hoped that nothing unhappy had befallen either Mi&s;s Howe or her Mother.

<P>'Tis true, I have owned more than once, that I could have liked Mr. Lovelace above all men. I re|member the debates you and I u&s;ed to have on this &s;ubject, when I was your happy gue&s;t. You u&s;ed to &s;ay, and once you wrote, that men of his ca&s;t are the men that our Sex do not <HI>naturally</HI> di&s;like: While I held, that &s;uch were not (however <HI>that</HI> might be) the men we <HI>ought</HI> to like. But what with my Relations precipitating of me, on one hand, and what with his unhappy character, and embarra&s;&s;ing ways, on the other, I had no more lei&s;ure than inclination to exa|mine my own heart in this particular. And this re|minds me of a pa&s;&s;age in one of your former Letters,
<PB N="113" REF="122">
which I will tran&s;cribe, tho' it was written in raillery. <HI>May it not be,</HI> &s;ay you <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. i. p. 66. of both Editions.</NOTE>, <HI>that you have had &s;uch per&s;ons to deal with, as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs; or, if you had them a little now-and-then, whether, having had two accounts to place them to, you have not by mi&s;take put them to the wrong one?</HI> A pa&s;&s;age, which, altho' it came into my mind when Mr. Lovelace was lea&s;t exceptionable, yet that I have denied any efficacy to, when he has teazed and vexed me, and given me cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion. For, after all, my dear, Mr. Lovelace is not wi&s;e in all his ways. And &s;hould we not endeavour, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, (where we are not attached by <HI>natural</HI> ties) to like and di&s;like as rea&s;on bids us, and according to the merit or demerit of the object? If Love, as it is called, is allowed to be an excu&s;e for our mo&s;t unrea&s;onable fol|lies, and to lay level all the fences that a careful edu|cation has &s;urrounded us by, what is meant by the doctrine of &s;ubduing our pa&s;&s;ions?&mdash;But, O my dear|e&s;t friend, am I not guilty of a puni&s;hable fault, were I to love this man of errors? And has not my own heart deceived me, when I thought I did not? And what mu&s;t be that Love, that has not &s;ome degree of purity for its object? I am afraid of recollecting &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in my Cou&s;in Morden's Letter <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. iii.

I have carried, I doubt, my notions on this head too high, not for practice, but for <HI>my</HI> practice. Yet think me not guilty of Prudery neither; for had I found out as much of my&s;elf before, or, rather, had he given me heart's-ea&s;e enough before to find it out, you &s;hould have had my confe&s;&s;ion &s;ooner.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="126">
thro' temporary remor&s;e: For the blow being not &s;truck, her guardian angel is redoubling his efforts to &s;ave her.</P>
<P>If it be not <HI>that</HI> [And yet what power &s;hould <HI>her</HI> guardian angel have over <HI>me?</HI>] I don't know what it is, that gives a check to my revenge, whenever I me|ditate trea&s;on again&s;t &s;o &s;overeign a virtue. Con|&s;cience is dead and gone, as I told thee; &s;o it cannot be that. A young Con&s;cience growing up, like the phoenix, from the a&s;hes of the old one, it cannot be &s;urely. But if it were, it would be hard, if I could not overlay a young Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Well then, it mu&s;t be LOVE, I fan&s;y. LOVE it|&s;elf, in&s;piring Love of an object &s;o adorable&mdash;Some little attention po&s;&s;ibly paid too to thy whining argu|ments in her favour.</P>
<P>Let LOVE then be allowed to be the moving prin|ciple; and the rather, as LOVE naturally makes the Lover loth to di&s;oblige the object of its flame; and knowing, that an offence of the <HI>meditated</HI> kind will be a mortal offence to her, cannot bear that I &s;hould think of giving it.</P>
<P>Let LOVE and me talk together a little on this &s;ub|ject&mdash;Be it a <HI>Young Con&s;cience,</HI> or <HI>Love,</HI> or <HI>Thy&s;elf,</HI> Jack, thou &s;ee&s;t that I am for giving every whiffler audience.

<P>AND now the debate is over.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and charming things (for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE) has this little urchin &s;ugge&s;ted in her favour.</P>
<P>He pretended to know both our hearts: And he would have it, that tho' my Love was a prodigious &s;trong and potent Love; and tho' it has the merit of many months faithful &s;ervice to plead, and has had
<PB N="118" REF="127">
infinite difficulties to &s;truggle with; yet that it is not THE RIGHT SORT OF LOVE.</P>
<P><HI>Right &s;ort of Love!</HI>&mdash;A puppy!&mdash;But, with due regard to your deity&s;hip, &s;aid I, what merit has &s;he with YOU, that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould be of her party? Is <HI>hers,</HI> I pray you, a <HI>right &s;ort of Love?</HI> Is it <HI>Love</HI> at all? She don't <HI>pretend</HI> that it is. She owns not your &s;ove|reignty. What a d&mdash;l moves <HI>You,</HI> to plead thus ear|ne&s;tly for a rebel, who de&s;pi&s;es your power?</P>
<P>And then he came with his <HI>If</HI>'s and <HI>And</HI>'s&mdash;And it would <HI>have been,</HI> and <HI>&s;till,</HI> as he believed, would be, Love, and a Love of the exalted kind, if I would en|courage it by the <HI>right &s;ort of Love</HI> he talked of: And, in ju&s;tification of his opinion, pleaded her own confe&s;&s;ions, as well tho&s;e of ye&s;terday, as of this morn|ing: And even went &s;o far back as to my Ipecacuanha-illne&s;s.</P>
<P>I never talked &s;o familiarly with his god&s;hip before: Thou maye&s;t think therefore, that his dialect &s;ounded oddly in my ears. And then he told me, how often I had thrown cold water upon the mo&s;t charming flame that ever warmed a Lady's bo&s;om, while yet but young and ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>I required a definition of this <HI>right &s;ort</HI> of Love. He tried at it: But made a &s;orry hand of it: Nor could I, for the &s;oul of me, be convinced, that what he meant to extol, was LOVE.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we had a notable controver&s;y upon this &s;ubject, in which he in&s;i&s;ted upon the <HI>unprecedented merit</HI> of the Lady. Neverthele&s;s I got the better of him; for he was &s;truck ab&s;olutely dumb, when (wave|ing her pre&s;ent perver&s;ene&s;s, which yet was a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to all his pleas) I a&s;&s;erted, and offered to prove it, by a thou&s;and in&s;tances <HI>impromptu,</HI> that Love was not governed by <HI>merit,</HI> nor could be under the domi|nion of <HI>prudence,</HI> or any other <HI>rea&s;oning power:</HI> And that if the Lady were capable of Love, it was of &s;uch a &s;ort of Love, <HI>as he had nothing to do with,</HI> and which never before reigned in a female heart.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="128">I a&s;ked him, What he thought of her flight from me, at a time when I was more than half overcome by the <HI>right &s;ort of Love</HI> he talked of?&mdash;And then I &s;hewed him the Letter &s;he wrote, and left behind her for me, with an intention, no doubt, ab&s;olutely to break my heart, or to provoke me to hang, drown, or &s;hoot my&s;elf; to &s;ay nothing of a multitude of decla|rations from her, defying his power, and imputing all that looked like Love in her behaviour to me, to the per&s;ecution and rejection of her friends; which made her think of me but as a la&s;t re&s;ort.</P>
<P>LOVE then gave her up. The Letter, he &s;aid, de|&s;erved neither pardon nor excu&s;e. He did not think he had been pleading for &s;uch a <HI>declared</HI> rebel. And as to the re&s;t, he &s;hould be a betrayer of the rights of his own &s;overeignty, if what I had alleged were true, and he were &s;till to plead for her.</P>
<P>I &s;wore to the truth of all. And <HI>truly</HI> I &s;wore: Which perhaps I do not always do.</P>
<P>And now what thinke&s;t thou mu&s;t become of the Lady, whom LOVE it&s;elf gives up, and CONSCIENCE cannot plead for?</P>

<P>Thou wilt be curious to know, what the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of
<PB N="120" REF="129">
the&s;e women are, to whom I intend &s;o much di&s;tin|ction. I think I have not heretofore mentioned any|thing-characteri&s;tic of their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Moore</HI> is a widow of about Thirty-eight; a little mortified by misfortunes; but tho&s;e are often the merrie&s;t folks, when warmed. She has good fea|tures &s;till; and is what they call much of a gentle|woman, and very neat in her per&s;on and dre&s;s. She has given over, I believe, all thoughts of our Sex: But when the dying embers are raked up about the half-con&s;umed &s;tump, there will be fuel enough left, I dare &s;ay, to blaze out, and give a comfortable warmth to a half-&s;tarved by &s;tander.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Bevis</HI> is comely; that is to &s;ay, plump; a lover of mirth, and one whom no grief ever dwelt with, I dare &s;ay, for a week together; about Twenty-five years of age: Mowbray will have very little dif|ficulty with her, I believe; for one cannot do every|thing one's &s;elf. And yet &s;ometimes women of this free ca&s;t, when it comes to the point, an&s;wer not the promi&s;es their chearful forwardne&s;s gives a man who has a view upon them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Rawlins</HI> is an agreeable young Lady enough; but not beautiful. She has &s;en&s;e, and would be thought <HI>to know the world,</HI> as it is called; but, for her know|lege, is more indebted to <HI>Theory</HI> than <HI>Experience.</HI> A mere whipt-&s;yllabub knowlege this, Jack, that always fails the per&s;on who tru&s;ts to it, when it &s;hould hold to do her &s;ervice. For &s;uch young Ladies have &s;o much dependence upon their own under&s;tanding and warine&s;s, are &s;o much above the cautions that the le&s;s opinionative may be benefited by, that their pre&s;um|ption is generally their overthrow, when attempted by a man of experience, who knows how to flatter their vanity, and to magnify their wi&s;dom, in order to take advantage of their folly. But, for Mi&s;s Rawlins, if I can add <HI>Experience</HI> to her <HI>Theory,</HI> what an accom|pli&s;hed per&s;on will &s;he be!&mdash;And how much will &s;he
<PB N="121" REF="130">
be obliged to me; and not only <HI>&s;he,</HI> but all tho&s;e who may be the better for the <HI>precepts</HI> &s;he thinks her&s;elf already &s;o well qualified to give! Dearly, Jack, do I love to engage with the&s;e <HI>precept-givers,</HI> and <HI>ex|ample-&s;etters.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Belford, altho' there is nothing &s;triking in any of the&s;e characters; yet may we, at a pinch, make a good frolicky half-day with them, if, after we have &s;oftened their wax at table by encouraging viands, we can &s;et our women and them into dancing: Dancing, which all women love, and all men &s;hould therefore promote, for <HI>both</HI> their &s;akes.</P>
<P>And thus, when Tourville &s;ings, Belton fiddles, Mowbray makes rough love, and I &s;mooth; and thou, Jack, wilt be by that time well enough to join in the chorus; the devil's in't, if we don't mould them into what &s;hape we plea&s;e&mdash;our own women, by their laughing freedoms, encouraging them to break thro' all their cu&s;tomary re&s;erves: For Women to Women, thou knowe&s;t, are great darers and incen|tives; not one of them loving to be outdone or out-dared, when their hearts are thoroughly warmed.</P>
<P>I know, at fir&s;t, the difficulty will be the <HI>accidental</HI> ab&s;ence of my dear Mrs. Lovelace, to whom princi|pally they will de&s;ign their vi&s;it: But if we can exhi|larate them, they won't then wi&s;h to &s;ee her; and I can form twenty accidents and excu&s;es, from one hour to another, for her ab&s;ence, till each &s;hall have a &s;ubject to take up all her thoughts.</P>

<P>Had I begun there, I am confident, as I have here|tofore &s;aid, that I &s;hould not have had half the diffi|culty with her, as I have had with her charming friend. For the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate girls have high pul&s;es, and a cle|ver fellow may make what &s;port he plea&s;es with their <HI>unevenne&s;&s;es</HI>&mdash;Now too high, now too low, you need only to provoke and appea&s;e them by turns; to bear with them, and forbear; to teaze, and a&s;k pardon; and &s;ometimes to give your&s;elf the merit of a &s;ufferer from them; then catching them in the moment of conce&s;&s;ion, con&s;cious of their ill u&s;age of you, they are all your own.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;edate, contemplative girls, never out of temper but with rea&s;on; when that rea&s;on is given them, hardly ever pardon, or afford you another op|portunity to offend.</P>
<P>It was in part the apprehen&s;ion that this would be &s;o with my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, that made me carry her to a place where I believed &s;he would be unable to e&s;cape me, altho' I were <HI>not</HI> to &s;ucceed in my fir&s;t attempts. El&s;e widow Sorlings's would have been as

well for me, as widow Sinclair's. For early I &s;aw, that there was no credulity in her to graft upon: No pretending to whine my&s;elf into her confidence.

And yet how long, even <HI>there,</HI> was I kept in awe, in &s;pite of <HI>natural incitement,</HI> and <HI>unnatural in&s;tigations</HI> (as I now think them) by the mere force of that native dignity, and obvious purity of mind and manners, which fill every one with re|verence, if not with <HI>holy love,</HI> as thou calle&s;t it, the moment he &s;ees her!&mdash;El&s;e, thinke&s;t thou not, it was ea&s;y for me to be a <HI>fine gentleman,</HI> and a <HI>delicate</HI> Lover, or, at lea&s;t, a <HI>&s;pecious</HI> and <HI>flattering</HI> one?</P>
<P>Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, finding the treaty, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of which they have &s;et their fooli&s;h hearts, likely to run into length, are about departing to their own Seats; having taken from me the be&s;t &s;ecurity the nature of the ca&s;e will admit of, that is to &s;ay, <HI>my word,</HI> to marry the Lady, if &s;he will have me.</P>
<P>And after all (methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t) Art thou &s;till re|&s;olved to repair, if reparation be put into thy power?</P>
<P>Why, Jack, I mu&s;t needs own, that my heart has now-and-then &s;ome retrograde motions, upon thinking &s;eriou&s;ly of the irrevocable ceremony. We do not ea&s;ily give up the de&s;ire of our hearts, and what we imagine e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s, let the expecta|tion or hope of compa&s;&s;ing it be ever &s;o unrea&s;onable or ab&s;urd in the opinion of others. <HI>Recurrings</HI> there will be: hankerings that will, on every but remotely-favourable incident (however before di&s;couraged and beaten back by ill &s;ucce&s;s) pop up, and abate the &s;a|tisfaction we &s;hould otherwi&s;e take in <HI>contrariant</HI> over|tures.</P>

<P>Nay, let me a&s;k, If <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> as it is called, in the animal creation, does not enable them to di&s;tingui&s;h their own, much more ea&s;ily than we, with our boa&s;ted <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and &s;agacity, in this nice particular, can do?</P>
<P>If &s;ome men, who have Wives but of doubtful vir|tue, con&s;idered this matter duly, I believe their inor|dinate ardor after gain would be a good deal cooled, when they could not be certain (tho' their <HI>Mates</HI> could) for who&s;e children they were elbowing, bu&s;tling, gripe|ing, and perhaps cheating, tho&s;e with whom they have concerns, whether friends, neighbours, or <HI>more</HI> cer|tain next-of-kin, by the Mother's &s;ide however.</P>

She thought it a point gained to make me profe&s;s <HI>&s;ome</HI> Religion. The Catholic has its conveniencies. I permitted her to bring a <HI>Father</HI> to me. My Reformation went on &s;wimmingly. The <HI>Father</HI> had hopes of me: He pa|plauded her zeal: So did I. And how do&s;t think it ended?&mdash;Not a girl in England, reading thus far, but would gue&s;s!&mdash;In a word, very happily! For &s;he not only <HI>brought</HI> me a Father, but <HI>made</HI> me one: And then, being &s;atisfied with each other's conver&s;ion, we took different Routes: She, into Navarre; I, into Italy: Both well inclined to propagate the good le&s;|&s;ons in which we had &s;o well in&s;tructed each other.</P>

<P>But thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, by her refu&s;al of money from Hickman, or Mi&s;s Howe, that the dear Extra|vagant takes a delight in oddne&s;&s;es, chu&s;ing to part with her cloaths, tho' for a &s;ong. Do&s;t think &s;he is not a little touched at times? I am afraid &s;he is. A little &s;pice of that in&s;anity, I doubt, runs thro' her, that &s;he had in a &s;tronger degree, in the fir&s;t week of my operations. Her contempt of life; her procla|mations; her refu&s;al of matrimony; and now of mo|ney
<PB N="134" REF="143">
from her mo&s;t intimate friends; are &s;prinklings of this kind, and no other way, I think, to be ac|counted for.</P>
<P>Her Apothecary is a good hone&s;t fellow. I like him much. But the &s;illy dear's harping &s;o continu|ally upon one &s;tring, dying, dying, dying, is what I have no patience with. I hope all this melancholy jargon is owing entirely to the way I would have her to be in. And it being as new to her as the Bible beau|ties to thee, no wonder &s;he knows not what to make of her&s;elf; and &s;o fan&s;ies &s;he is breeding death, when the event will turn out quite the contrary.</P>
<P>Thou art a &s;orry fellow in thy remarks on the edu|cation and qualification of Smarts and Beaux of the Raki&s;h order; if by thy <HI>We's</HI> and <HI>Us's</HI> thou meane&s;t thy&s;elf or me: For I pretend to &s;ay, that the picture has no re&s;emblance of Us, who have read and conver&s;ed as we have done. It may indeed, and I believe it does, re&s;emble the generality of the fops and coxcombs about town. But That let them look to; for, if it affects not me, to what purpo&s;e thy random &s;hot?&mdash;If indeed thou finde&s;t, by the new light darted in upon thee, &s;ince thou ha&s;t had the honour of conver&s;ing with this admirable creature, that the cap fits thy own head, why then, according to the <HI>Qui capit</HI> rule, e'en take and clap it on: And I will add a &s;tring of Bells to it, to complete thee for the fore-hor&s;e of the idiot team.</P>
<P>Altho' I ju&s;t now &s;aid a kind thing or two for this fellow Hickman; yet I can tell thee, I could (to u&s;e one of my noble Peer's humble phra&s;es) <HI>eat him up without a corn of &s;alt,</HI> when I think of his impu|dence to &s;alute my charmer <HI>twice</HI> at parting: And have &s;till le&s;s patience with the Lady her&s;elf for pre|&s;uming to offer her cheek or lip [Thou &s;aye&s;t not which] to him, and to pre&s;s his clum&s;y fi&s;t between her charming hands.

her, as thou &s;aye&s;t he did, to his &s;tupid heart; at that time, no doubt, more &s;en&s;ible, than ever it was be|fore!</P>
<P>By thy de&s;cription of their parting, I &s;ee thou wilt be a delicate fellow in time. My Mortification in this Lady's di&s;plea&s;ure, will be thy exaltation from her conver&s;ation. I envy thee as well for thy opportuni|ties as for thy improvements: And &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion has thy concluding paragraph made upon me, that I wi&s;h I do not get into a Reformation-humour as well as thou: And then what a couple of lamentable pup|pies &s;hall we make, howling in recitative to each other's di&s;cordant mu&s;ic!</P>
<P>Let me improve upon the thought, and imagine that, turned Hermits, we have opened the two old Caves at Horn&s;ey, or dug new ones; and in each of our cells &s;et up a death's head, and an hour-gla&s;s, for objects of contemplation&mdash;I have &s;een &s;uch a picture: But then, Jack, had not the old penitent fornicator a &s;uffocating long grey beard? What figures would a couple of brocaded or laced-wai&s;tcoated toupets make with their &s;our &s;crew'd up half-cock'd faces, and more than half-&s;hut eyes, in a kneeling attitude, recapitulating their re&s;pective rogueries? This &s;cheme, were we only to make trial of it, and return after|wards to our old ways, might &s;erve to better purpo&s;e by far, than Horner's in the Country Wife, to bring the pretty wenches to us.</P>

<P>I have received two Letters to &s;et me <HI>right:</HI> One from a <HI>particular acquaintance</HI> (whom I &s;et to en|quire of Mr. Belford's character); and that came on Tue&s;day la&s;t, informing me, that your <HI>unhappy Niece</HI> was greatly injured in the account I had had of her (for I had told <HI>him</HI> of it, and that with very <HI>great concern,</HI> I am &s;ure, apprehending it to be <HI>true</HI>).

<P>Notwith&s;tanding, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe (I mu&s;t be bold to &s;ay) is the <HI>only young Lady,</HI> that ever I heard of (or indeed read of) that, <HI>having made &s;uch a fal&s;e &s;tep,</HI> &s;o <HI>&s;oon</HI> (of <HI>her own accord,</HI> as I may &s;ay) <HI>recovered</HI> her&s;elf, and conquered her <HI>Love of the deceiver</HI> (A great conque&s;t indeed!); and who flieth him, and re&s;olveth to <HI>die,</HI> rather than to be his; which now to her never-dying <HI>honour</HI> (I am well a&s;&s;ured) is the ca&s;e&mdash;And, in <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to her, I am now ready to take to my&s;elf (with no &s;mall vex|ation) that of Ovid,

<P>And &s;o, Sir, I mu&s;t de&s;ire of you, that you will not let <HI>any blame</HI> lie upon my <HI>intention</HI>; &s;ince you &s;ee how ready I am to <HI>accu&s;e my&s;elf</HI> of too lightly giving ear to a <HI>ra&s;h information</HI> (not knowing it &s;o to be, however): For I depended the more upon it, as the <HI>people I had it from</HI> are very <HI>&s;ober,</HI> and live in the <HI>fear of God:</HI> And indeed when I wait upon you, you will &s;ee by their Letter, that they mu&s;t be <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> good people: Wherefore, Sir, let me be entitled, from <HI>all your good family,</HI> to that of my la&s;t-named poet,

<P>And now, Sir (what is much more becoming of my <HI>function</HI>) let me, in&s;tead of appearing with the <HI>face of an accu&s;er,</HI> and a <HI>ra&s;h cen&s;urer</HI> (which in my <HI>heart</HI> I have not <HI>de&s;erved</HI> to be thought), a&s;&s;ume the character of <HI>a reconciler</HI>; and propo&s;e (by way of <HI>penance</HI> to my&s;elf for my <HI>fault</HI>) to be &s;ent up as a <HI>me&s;&s;enger of peace</HI> to the <HI>pious young Lady</HI>; for they write me word <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> (and, I believe in my heart, <HI>truly</HI>) that the <HI>Doctors</HI> have <HI>given her over,</HI> and that &s;he <HI>cannot live.</HI> Alas! alas! what a &s;ad thing would that be, if the <HI>poor bough,</HI> that was only de&s;igned (as I <HI>very well know,</HI> and am <HI>fully a&s;&s;ured) to be bent, &s;hould be broken!</HI></P>

<P>And now, Sir, let me tell you what &s;hall be the <HI>tenor</HI> of my <HI>pleadings</HI> with her, and <HI>comfortings</HI> of her, as &s;he is, as I may &s;ay, a <HI>learned Lady</HI>; and as I can <HI>explain</HI> to her <HI>tho&s;e &s;entences,</HI> which &s;he can|not &s;o readily <HI>con&s;true her&s;elf:</HI> And this in order to convince <HI>you</HI> (did you not already <HI>know</HI> my <HI>qualifi|cations</HI>) how well qualified I <HI>am</HI> for the <HI>Chri&s;tian Office</HI> to which I commend my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will, IN THE FIRST PLACE, put her in mind of the <HI>common cour&s;e of things</HI> in this <HI>&s;ublunary world,</HI>

<P>SECONDLY, I will remind her of her own notable de&s;cription of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> when &s;he was once called upon to di&s;tingui&s;h wherein <HI>Sorrow, Grief,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy,</HI> differed from each other; which &s;he did <HI>impromptu,</HI> by their <HI>effects,</HI> in a truly admirable manner, to the high &s;atisfaction of every one: I my&s;elf could not, by <HI>&s;tudy,</HI> have di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>better,</HI> nor more <HI>conci&s;ely</HI>&mdash;SORROW, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>wears</HI>; GRIEF <HI>tears</HI>; but MELANCHOLY <HI>&s;ooths.</HI></P>
<P>My inference to her &s;hall be, that &s;ince a happy Reconciliation will take place, <HI>Grief</HI> will be bani&s;hed; <HI>Sorrow</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and only &s;weet <HI>Melancholy</HI> remain to <HI>&s;ooth</HI> and <HI>indulge</HI> her <HI>contrite heart,</HI> and &s;hew to all the world the penitent &s;en&s;e &s;he hath of her great error.</P>

<P>I could here, Sir, pur&s;uing the allegory of David and Goliath, give you &s;ome of the <HI>&s;tones (Hard ar|guments</HI> may be called <HI>&s;tones,</HI> &s;ince they <HI>knock down</HI> a <HI>pertinacious opponent</HI>) which I could <HI>pelt him with,</HI> were he to be wroth with me; and this in order to take from you, Sir, all apprehen&s;ions for my <HI>life,</HI> or my <HI>bones</HI>; but I forbear them till you demand them of me, when I have the honour to attend you in per&s;on.</P>

<P>She was exceedingly charitable; the only one of her family that knew the meaning of the word: And this with regard both to the &s;ouls and the bodies of tho&s;e who were the well-cho&s;en objects of her benevolence.

<P>In all her Readings, and in her Conver&s;ations upon them, &s;he was fonder of finding beauties than blemi&s;hes, and cho&s;e to applaud both Authors and Books, where &s;he could find the lea&s;t room for it. Yet &s;he u&s;ed to lament, that certain writers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, who were capable of exalting virtue, and of putting vice out of countenance, too generally employed them&s;elves in works of <HI>imagination only,</HI> upon &s;ubjects <HI>merely &s;pecula|tive, di&s;intere&s;ting,</HI> and <HI>unedifying</HI>; from which no u&s;eful moral or example could be drawn.</P>
<P>But &s;he was a &s;evere Cen&s;urer of pieces of a <HI>light</HI> or <HI>indecent</HI> turn, which had a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth, to convey polluted images, or to wound religion, whether in it&s;elf, or thro' the &s;ides of its profe&s;&s;ors, and this whoever were the authors, and how admirable &s;oever the execution. She often pitied the celebrated Dr. Swift for &s;o employing his admirable pen, that a pure eye was afraid of looking into his works, and a pure ear of hearing any-thing quoted from them. 'Such authors,' &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay,

Nor would &s;he, on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, admit their beauties as a palliation; on the contrary, &s;he held it as an aggravation of their crime,

that they who were &s;o capable of <HI>mending the heart,</HI> &s;hould in any places &s;hew a <HI>corrupt one</HI> in them&s;elves; which mu&s;t weaken the influences of their good works, and pull down with one hand what they built up with the other.</P>

<P>Altho' &s;he was well read in the Engli&s;h, French, and Italian Poets, and had read the be&s;t tran&s;lations of the Latin Cla&s;&s;ics; yet &s;eldom did &s;he quote or repeat from them, either in her Letters or Conver&s;ation, tho' exceedingly happy in a tenacious memory; principally thro' mode&s;ty, and to avoid the imputation of that <HI>affectation</HI> which I have ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. Wyerley once &s;aid of her, &s;he had &s;uch a fund of knowlege of her own, and made naturally &s;uch fine ob&s;ervations upon per&s;ons and things, being capable <HI>by the Egg</HI> [that was his familiar expre&s;&s;ion] <HI>of judging of the</HI> BIRD, that &s;he had &s;eldom either room or ne|ce&s;&s;ity for foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tances.</P>

Ladies of his family, tho' invited by the latter) from whence &s;he might propo&s;e terms which ought to have been complied with, and which were entirely con&s;i&s;tent with her duty&mdash;That tho' &s;he found her&s;elf di&s;appointed of the hoped-for refuge and protection, &s;he intended not by meeting Mr. Lovelace, to put her&s;elf into his power; all that &s;he aimed at by taking that &s;tep, being to endeavour to pacify &s;o fierce a &s;pirit, le&s;t he &s;hould (as he indeed was determined to do) pay a vi&s;it to her friends which might have been attended with fatal con|&s;equences; but was &s;pirited away by him in &s;uch a manner, as made her an object of pity, rather than of blame.</P>
<P>The&s;e Extracts further convinced them all, that it was to her unaffected regret, that &s;he found, that Mar|riage was not in her power afterwards for a long time; and at la&s;t, but on one occa&s;ion, when their unnatural cruelty to her (on a new application &s;he had made to her Aunt Hervey, to procure mercy and pardon) ren|dered her incapable of receiving his proffer'd hand; and &s;o obliged her to &s;u&s;pend the day; intending only to &s;u&s;pend it, till recovered.</P>

She would bu&s;tle her&s;elf into a place, and make room for her more ba&s;hful companions, through the frowns of the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, at a crouded theatre; leaving every one near her amazed at her &s;elf-con&s;equence, wondering &s;he had no &s;ervant to keep place for her; whi&s;peringly en|quiring who &s;he was; and then &s;itting down ad|miring her fortitude.</P>
<P>She officiou&s;ly made her&s;elf of con&s;equence to the mo&s;t noted Players; who, as one of their patrone&s;&s;es, applied to her for her intere&s;t, on their Benefit-nights. She knew the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as well as <HI>Sur</HI>-Name of every pretty fellow who frequented public places; and affected to &s;peak of them by their former.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had not obeyed the call her eyes al|ways made upon all of them for notice at her en|trance, or before &s;he took her &s;eat, were &s;poken of with haughtine&s;s, as, Jack's, or Tom's; while her
<PB N="183" REF="192">
favourites, with an affectedly-endearing familiarity, and a prettine&s;s of accent, were Jackeys and Tom|mys; and if they &s;tood very high in her graces, Dear Devils, and Agreeable Toads.</P>
<P>She &s;at in judgment, and an inexorable judge &s;he was, upon the actions and conduct of every man and woman of quality and fa&s;hion, as they became the &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation. She was deeply learned in the &s;candalous Chronicle: She made every character, every prai&s;e, and every cen&s;ure, &s;erve to exalt her&s;elf. <HI>She &s;hould &s;corn to do &s;o or &s;o!</HI>&mdash;Or, <HI>That was ever her way</HI>; and <HI>ju&s;t what &s;he did, or liked to do</HI>; and judging her&s;elf by the vilene&s;s of the mo&s;t vile of her Sex, &s;he wiped her mouth, and &s;at down &s;atisfied witli her own virtue.</P>
<P>She had her Chair to attend her where-ever &s;he went, and found people among her <HI>Betters,</HI> as her pride &s;tooped to call &s;ome of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant people in the world, to encourage her vi&s;its.</P>
<P>She was practi&s;ed in all the arts of the Card-table: A true Spartan girl; and had even courage, occa&s;ion|ally, to wrangle off a detection. Late hours (turn|ing night into day, and day into night) were the al|mo&s;t unavoidable con&s;equence of her frequent play. Her parents plea&s;ed them&s;elves that their Sally had a charming con&s;titution: And as long as &s;he &s;uffered not in her health, they were regardle&s;s of her morals.</P>
<P>The Needle &s;he hated: And made the con&s;tant &s;ubjects of her ridicule the fine works that u&s;ed to employ, and to keep out of idlene&s;s, luxury, and ex|travagance, and at <HI>home</HI> (were they to have been of no other &s;ervice) the women of the la&s;t age, when there were no Vaux-halls, Ranelaghs, Marybones, and &s;uch-like places of diver&s;ion, to dre&s;s out for, and gad after.</P>
<P>And as to Family-management, her parents had not required any knowlege of that &s;ort from her; and &s;he con&s;idered it as a qualification only nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="184" REF="193">
for hirelings, and the low-born, and as utterly un|worthy of the attention of a modern fine Lady.</P>
<P>Altho' her Father had great bu&s;ine&s;s, yet, living in &s;o high and expen&s;ive a way, he pretended not to give her a fortune an&s;werable to it. Neither he nor his Wife, having &s;et out with any notion of frugality, could think of retrenching. Nor did their Daughter de&s;ire that they &s;hould retrench. They thought glare or o&s;tentation reputable. They called it living <HI>gen|teelly.</HI> And as they lifted their heads above their neighbours, they &s;uppo&s;ed their credit concerned to go forward rather than backward in outward appearances. They flattered them&s;elves, and they flattered their girl, and &s;he was <HI>entirely</HI> of their opinion, that &s;he had charms and wit enough to attract &s;ome man of rank; of <HI>Fortune</HI> at lea&s;t: And yet this Daughter of a Mercer-Father and Grocer-Mother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping Cit; encouraging her&s;elf with the few in&s;tances (<HI>comparatively</HI> few) which &s;he had always in her head as <HI>common ones,</HI> of girls much inferior to her|&s;elf in &s;tation, talents, education, and even fortune, who had &s;ucceeded&mdash;as &s;he doubted not to &s;ucceed. Hand&s;ome Settlements, and a Chariot, that tempting gewgaw to the vanity of the middling cla&s;s of females, were the lea&s;t that &s;he propo&s;ed to her&s;elf. But all this while, neither her parents nor her&s;elf con&s;idered, that &s;he had appetites indulged to &s;truggle with, and a turn of education given her, as well as a warm con&s;titution, unguarded by &s;ound principles, and unbenefited by example, which made her much better qualified for a Mi&s;tre&s;s than a Wife.</P>
<P>Her Twentieth year, to her own equal wonder and regret, pa&s;&s;ed over her head, and &s;he had not had one offer that her pride would permit her to accept of. A girl from Fifteen to Eighteen, her beauty then begin|ning to blo&s;&s;om, will, as a new thing, attract the eyes of men: But if &s;he make her face cheap at public places, &s;he will find, that <HI>new</HI> faces will draw more at|tention
<PB N="185" REF="194">
than <HI>fine</HI> faces con&s;tantly &s;een. Policy there|fore, if nothing el&s;e were con&s;idered, would induce a young Beauty, if &s;he could tame her vanity, ju&s;t to &s;hew her&s;elf, and to be talked of, and then withdraw|ing, as if from di&s;cretion (and di&s;creet it will be to do &s;o) expect to be <HI>&s;ought after,</HI> rather than to be thought to <HI>&s;eek for</HI>; only reviving now-and-then the memory of her&s;elf, at the public places in turn, if &s;he find her|&s;elf likely to be forgotten; and then &s;he will be new again. But this ob&s;ervation ought young Ladies al|ways to have in their heads, that they can hardly ever expect to gratify their vanity, and at the &s;ame time gain the admiration of men worthy of making partners for life. They may, in &s;hort, have many admirers at public places, but not one Lover.</P>
<P>Sally Martin knew nothing of this doctrine. Her beauty was in its bloom, and yet &s;he found her|&s;elf neglected.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Sally Martin, the Mercer's Daughter: &s;he never fails being here;'</Q>
was the an&s;wer, and the accompanying ob&s;ervation, made to every Que&s;tioner, Who is that Lady?</P>
<P>At la&s;t, her de&s;tiny approached. It was at a Ma&s;|querade, that &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw the gay, the hand&s;ome Love|lace, who was ju&s;t returned from his travels. She was immediately &s;truck with his figure, and with the bril|liant things that &s;he heard fall from his lips as he hap|pened to &s;it near her. He, who was not then looking out for a Wife, was taken with Sally's &s;martne&s;s, and with an air that at the &s;ame time &s;hewed her to be equally genteel and &s;elf-&s;ignificant; and &s;igns of ap|probation mutually pa&s;&s;ing, he found no difficulty in acquainting him&s;elf where to vi&s;it her next day. And yet it was &s;ome mortification to a per&s;on of her &s;elf-con&s;equence, and gay appearance, to &s;ubmit to be known by &s;o fine a young gentleman as no more than a Mercer's daughter. So natural is it for a girl brought up as Sally was, to be occa&s;ionally a&s;hamed of tho&s;e who&s;e folly had &s;et her above her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="195">But whatever it might be to Sally, it was no di&s;ap|pointment to Mr. Lovelace, to find his Mi&s;tre&s;s of no higher degree; becau&s;e he hoped to reduce her &s;oon to the lowe&s;t condition that an unhappy woman can fall into.</P>
<P>But when Mi&s;s Martin had informed her&s;elf, that her Lover was the Nephew and pre&s;umptive Heir of Lord M. &s;he thought him the very man for whom &s;he had been &s;o long and &s;o impatiently looking out; and for whom it was worth her while to &s;pread her toils. And here it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that it is very probable, that Mr. Lovelace had Sally Martin in his thoughts, and perhaps two or three more who&s;e hopes of marriage from him had led them to their ruin, when he drew the following whim&s;ical picture, in a Letter to his friend Belford, not in&s;erted in the preceding Collection.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, Sally's parents, as well as her&s;elf, encou|raged Mr. Lovelace's vi&s;its. They thought they might tru&s;t to a di&s;cretion in her which &s;he her&s;elf was too wi&s;e to doubt. Pride they knew &s;he had. And that, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is often called di&s;cretion &mdash;Lord help the Sex, &s;ays Lovelace, if they had not Pride!&mdash;Nor did they &s;u&s;pect danger from that &s;pecious air of &s;in|cerity, and gentlene&s;s of manners, which he could a&s;|&s;ume or lay a&s;ide whenever he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Ma&s;querade, which was no more than their third meeting abroad, completed her ruin, from &s;o practi&s;ed, tho' &s;o young a deceiver; and that before &s;he well knew &s;he was in danger: For, having pre|vailed on her to go off with him about Twelve o'clock to his Aunt Forbes's, a Lady of honour and fortune, to whom he had given rea&s;on to expect her <HI>future Niece</HI> [the only hint of Marriage he ever gave her], he carried her to the hou&s;e of the wicked woman, who bears the name of Sinclair in the&s;e Papers: And there, by promi&s;es which &s;he under&s;tood in the favourable &s;en&s;e (for where a woman loves, &s;he &s;eldom doubts enough for her own &s;afety) obtained an ea&s;y conque&s;t over a virtue that was little more than nominal.</P>
<P>He found it not difficult to induce her to proceed in the guilty commerce, till the effects of it became too apparent to be hid. Her Parents then (in the fir&s;t fury of their di&s;appointment, and vexation for being deprived of all hopes of &s;uch a Son-in-law) turned her out of doors.</P>
<P>Her di&s;grace thus publi&s;hed, &s;he became hardened; and, protected by her &s;educer, who&s;e favourite Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;he then was, &s;he was &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t her Parents, for an indignity &s;o little &s;uiting with her pride, and the head they had always given her, that &s;he refu&s;ed to re|turn to them, when, repenting of their pa&s;&s;onate treat|ment of her, they would have been reconciled to her:
<PB N="188" REF="197">
And, becoming the favourite Daughter of her Mother Sinclair, at the per&s;ua&s;ions of that abandoned woman, &s;he practi&s;ed to bring on an abortion, which &s;he ef|fected, tho' &s;he was &s;o far gone, that it had like to have co&s;t her her life.</P>
<P>Thus, uncha&s;tity her fir&s;t crime, murder her next, her con&s;cience became &s;eared; and, young as &s;he was, and fond of her deceiver, &s;oon grew indelicate enough, having &s;o thorough-paced a School-mi&s;tre&s;s, to do all &s;he could to promote the plea&s;ures of the man who had ruined her; &s;crupling not, with a &s;pirit truly diabo|lical, to endeavour to draw in others to follow her example. And it is hardly to be believed what mi&s;|chiefs of this &s;ort &s;he was the means of effecting; woman confiding in, and daring woman; and &s;he a creature of &s;pecious appearance, and great art.</P>
<P>A &s;till viler wickedne&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, remains to be &s;aid of Sally Martin.</P>
<P>Her Father dying, her Mother, in hopes to <HI>reclaim</HI> her, as &s;he called it, propo&s;ed to her to quit the hou&s;e of the infamous Sinclair, and to retire with her into the country, where her di&s;grace, and her then wicked way of live, would not be known; and there &s;o to life, as to &s;ave appearances; the only virtue &s;he had ever taught her; be&s;ides that of endeavouring rather to delude than to be deluded.</P>
<P>To this Sally con&s;ented; but with no other in|tention, as &s;he often owned (and gloried in it) than to cheat her Mother of the greate&s;t part of her &s;ub|&s;tance, in revenge for con&s;enting to her being turned out of doors long before, and by way of repri&s;al for having per&s;uaded her Father, as &s;he would have it, to cut her off, in his la&s;t Will, from any &s;hare in his fortune.</P>
<P>This unnatural wickedne&s;s, in half a year's time, &s;he brought about; and then the Serpent retired to her ob&s;cene den with her &s;poils, laughing at what &s;he had done; even after it had broken her Mother's

heart, as it did in a few months time: A &s;evere, but ju&s;t puni&s;hment for the unprincipled education &s;he had given her.</P>
<P>It ought to be added, that this was an iniquity, of which neither Mr. Lovelace, nor any of his friends, could bear to hear her boa&s;t; and always check'd her for it whenever &s;he did; condemning it with one voice: And it is certain, that this and other in&s;tances of her complicated wickedne&s;s, turned early Love|lace's heart again&s;t her; and, had &s;he not been &s;ub|&s;ervient to him in his other pur&s;uits, he would not have endured her: For, &s;peaking of her, he would &s;ay, Let not any one reproach <HI>us,</HI> Jack: <HI>There is no wickedne&s;s like the wickedne&s;s of a woman</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ecclus. xxv. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A bad education was the preparative, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed: And for this Sally Martin had rea&s;on to thank her Parents: As they had rea&s;on to thank them&s;elves, for what followed: But, had &s;he not met with a Lovelace, &s;he had avoided a Sinclair; and might have gone on at the common rate of wives &s;o educated; and been the Mother of children turned out to take their chance in the world, as &s;he was; &s;o many lumps of &s;oft was, fit to take any impre&s;&s;ion that the fir&s;t accident gave them; neither happy, nor making happy; every-thing but u&s;eful; and well off, if not extremely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>POLLY HORTON was the Daughter of a gentle|woman well de&s;cended; who&s;e Hu&s;band, a man of family, and of honour, was a Captain in the Guards.</P>
<P>He died when Polly was about Nine years of age, leaving her to the care of her Mother, a lively young Lady of about Twenty-&s;ix; with a genteel provi&s;ion for both.</P>
<P>Her Mother was extremely fond of her Polly; but had it not in <HI>her&s;elf</HI> to manife&s;t the true, the genuine fondne&s;s of a Parent, by a &s;trict and guarded educa|tion; dre&s;&s;ing out, and vi&s;iting, and being vi&s;ited by

the gay of her own Sex, and ca&s;ting out her eye abroad, as one very ready to try her fortune again in the married &s;tate.</P>

<PB N="191" REF="200">
But little thought the fond, the fooli&s;h Mother, what the plant would be, which was &s;pringing up from the&s;e &s;eeds! Little imagined &s;he, that her own ruin, as well as her child's, was to be the con&s;equence of this fine education; and that, in the &s;ame ill-fated hour, the honour both of Mother and Daughter was to become a &s;acrifice to the intriguing Invader.</P>
<P>This the laughing girl, when abandoned to her evil de&s;tiny, and in company with her Si&s;ter Sally, and others, each recounting their &s;ettings-out, their progre&s;s, and their fall, frequently related to be her education and manner of training-up.</P>
<P>This, and to &s;ee a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Humble Servants buzzing about a Mother, who took too much pride in addre&s;&s;es of that kind, what a beginning, what an example, to a con&s;titution of tinder, &s;o prepared to receive the &s;park &s;truck from the &s;teely forehead, and flinty heart, of &s;uch a Libertine, as at la&s;t it was their fortune to be encountered by!</P>

<P>The foregoing Work having been publi&s;hed at three different periods of time, the Author, in the cour&s;e of its publication, was favoured with many anonymous Letters, in which the Writers differently expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes with regard to the apprehended cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e directed to him by the gentler Sex, turned in favour of what they called a <HI>Fortunate End|ing.</HI> Some of the fair writers, enamoured, as they de|clared, with the character of the Heroine, were warmly &s;olicitous to have her made happy: And others, like|wi&s;e of their mind, <HI>in&s;i&s;ted that Poetical Ju&s;tice</HI> re|quired that it &s;hould be &s;o. And when, &s;ays one in|genious Lady, who&s;e undoubted motive was good-nature and humanity, it mu&s;t be concluded, that it is in an author's power to make his piece end as he plea&s;es, why &s;hould he not give plea&s;ure rather than pain to the Reader whom he has intere&s;ted in favour of his principal characters?</P>
<P>Others, and &s;ome Gentlemen, declared again&s;t Tragedies in general, and in favour of Comedies, al|mo&s;t in the words of Lovelace, who was &s;upported in his ta&s;te by all the women at Mrs. Sinclair's, and by Sinclair her&s;elf.

<P>And how was this happy ending to be brought about? Why, by this very ea&s;y and trite expedient;

to wit, by reforming Lovelace, and marrying him to Clari&s;&s;a&mdash;Not, however, abating her one of her tri|als, nor any of her &s;ufferings [for the &s;ake of the &s;port her di&s;tre&s;&s;es would give to the <HI>tender-hearted</HI> reader as &s;he went along] the la&s;t outrage excepted: That indeed, partly in compliment to Lovelace him&s;elf, and partly for delicacy-&s;ake, they were willing to &s;pare her.</P>
<P>But whatever were the fate of his work, the Au|thor was re&s;olved to take a different method. He al|ways thought, that <HI>&s;udden Conver&s;ions,</HI> &s;uch e&s;pecially, as were left to the candour of the Reader to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> and <HI>make out,</HI> had neither <HI>Art,</HI> nor <HI>Nature,</HI> nor even <HI>Probability,</HI> in them; and that they were moreover of very <HI>bad</HI> example. To have a Lovelace for a &s;e|ries of years glory in his wickedne&s;s, and think that he had nothing to do, but as an act of grace and favour to hold out his hand to receive that of the be&s;t of wo|men, whenever he plea&s;ed, and to have it thought, that Marriage would be a &s;ufficient amends for all his enormities to others, as well as to her; he could not bear that. Nor is Reformation, as he has &s;hewn in another piece, to be &s;ecured by a fine face; by a pa&s;&s;ion that has &s;en&s;e for its object; nor by the goodne&s;s of a Wife's heart, or even example, if the heart of the Hu&s;band be not graciou&s;ly touched by the Divine Finger.</P>
<P>It will be &s;een by this time, that the Author had a great end in view. He has lived to &s;ee Sceptici&s;m and Infidelity openly avowed, and even endeavoured to be propagated from the <HI>Pre&s;s:</HI> The great doctrines of the Go&s;pel brought into que&s;tion: Tho&s;e of &s;elf-de|nial and mortification blotted out of the catalogue of chri&s;tian virtues: And a ta&s;te even to wantonne&s;s for out-door plea&s;ure and luxury, to the general exclu&s;ion of dome&s;tic as well as public virtue, indu&s;triou&s;ly pro|moted among all ranks and degrees of people.</P>
<P>In this general depravity, when even the Pulpit has
<PB N="197" REF="206">
lo&s;t great part of its weight, and the Clergy are con|&s;idered as a body of <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> men, the Author thought, he &s;hould be able to an&s;wer it to his own heart, be the &s;ucce&s;s what it would, if he threw in his mite towards introducing a Reformation &s;o much wanted: And he imagined, that if in an age given up to diver&s;ion and entertainment, he could <HI>&s;teal in,</HI> as may be &s;aid, and inve&s;tigate the great doctrines of Chri&s;tianity under the fa&s;hionable gui&s;e of an amu&s;ement; he &s;hould be mo&s;t likely to &s;erve his purpo&s;e; remembring that of the Poet:
<Q><L>A ver&s;e may find him who a &s;ermon flies,</L>
<L>And turn delight into a &s;acrifice.</L></Q></P>
<P>He was re&s;olved therefore to attempt &s;omething that never yet had been done. He con&s;idered, that the Tragic poets have as &s;eldom made their heroes true ob|jects of pity, as the Comic theirs laudable ones of imi|tation: And &s;till more rarely have made them in their deaths look forward to a <HI>future Hope.</HI> And thus, when they die, they &s;eem totally to peri&s;h. Death, in &s;uch in&s;tances, mu&s;t appear terrible. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t evil. But why is Death &s;et in &s;hocking lights, when it is the univer&s;al lot?</P>
<P>He has indeed thought fit to paint the death of the wicked as terrible as he could paint it. But he has en|deavoured to draw that of the good in &s;uch an amiable manner, that the very Balaams of the world &s;hould not forbear to wi&s;h that their latter end might be like that of the Heroine.</P>
<P>And after all, what is the <HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice</HI> &s;o much contended for by &s;ome, as the generality of writers have managed it, but another &s;ort of di&s;pen&s;ation than that with which God, by Revelation, teaches us, He has thought fit to exerci&s;e mankind; whom placing here only in a &s;tate of probation, he hath &s;o intermingled good and evil, as to nece&s;&s;itate us to look forward for a more equal di&s;pen&s;ation of both?</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="207">The Author of the Hi&s;tory (or rather Dramatic Nar|rative) of Clari&s;&s;a is therefore well ju&s;tified by the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem,</HI> in deferring to extricate &s;uffering Vir|tue to the time in which it will meet with the <HI>Comple|tion</HI> of its Reward.</P>

<P>Several per&s;ons have cen&s;ured the Heroine as too

cold in her love, too haughty, and even &s;ometimes provoking. But we may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that this objection has ari&s;en from want of attention to the Story, to the Character of Clari&s;&s;a, and to her parti|cular Situation.</P>
<P>It was not intended that &s;he &s;hould be <HI>in Love,</HI> but <HI>in Liking</HI> only, if that expre&s;&s;ion may be admitted. It is meant to be every-where inculcated in the Story, for <HI>Example-&s;ake,</HI> that &s;he never would have married Mr. Lovelace, becau&s;e of his immoralities, had &s;he been left to her&s;elf; and that her ruin was principally owing to the per&s;ecutions of her friends.</P>
<P>What is too generally called <HI>Love,</HI> ought (perhaps <HI>as</HI> generally) to be called by another name. <HI>Cupidity,</HI> or a <HI>Paphian Stimulus,</HI> as &s;ome women, even of con|dition, have acted, are not words too har&s;h to be &s;ub&s;tituted on the occa&s;ion, however grating they may be to delicate ears. But take the word <HI>Love</HI> in the gentle&s;t and mo&s;t honourable &s;en&s;e, it would have been thought by &s;ome highly improbable, that Clari&s;&s;a &s;hould have been able to &s;hew &s;uch a command of her pa&s;&s;ions, as makes &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a part of her Cha|racter, had &s;he been as violently in Love, as certain warm and fierce &s;pirits would have had her to be.

For thus the Heroine anticipates this very Objection, expo&s;tu|lating with Mi&s;s Howe on her contemptuous treat|ment of Mr. Hickman; which [far from being guilty of the &s;ame fault her&s;elf] &s;he did on all occa&s;ions, and declares &s;he would do, whenever Mi&s;s Howe forgot her&s;elf, altho' &s;he had not a day to live:</P>

<P>But the Reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that great, and, it is hoped, good U&s;e, has been made throughout the Work, by drawing Lovelace an Infidel only in <HI>Pra|ctice</HI>; and this as well in the arguments of his friend Belford, as in his own frequent Remor&s;es, when touched with temporary Compunction, and in his la&s;t Scenes; which could not have been made, had either of them been painted as <HI>&s;entimental</HI> Unbelievers. Not to &s;ay, that Clari&s;&s;a, who&s;e great Objection to Mr. Wyerley was, that he was a Scoffer, mu&s;t have been inexcu&s;eable had &s;he known Lovelace to be &s;o, and had given the lea&s;t attention to his Addre&s;&s;es.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'This one con&s;olation, however, re|mains: He is not an Infidel, an Unbeliever. Had he been an Infidel, there would have been no room at all for hope of him; but (priding him&s;elf as he does in his fertile invention) he would have been utterly abandoned, irreclaimable, and a Savage <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. IV. p. 246.</NOTE>.'</Q>
And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that Scoffers are too witty in their own opinion; in other words, value them&s;elves too much upon their profligacy, to aim at concealing it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, had Lovelace added ribbald je&s;ts upon Re|ligion, to his other liberties, the freedoms which would then have pa&s;&s;ed between him and his friend, mu&s;t have been of a nature truly infernal. And this far|ther hint was meant to be given, by way of inference, that the man who allowed him&s;elf in tho&s;e liberties either of &s;peech or action, which Lovelace thought &s;hameful, was &s;o far a wor&s;e man than Lovelace. For this rea&s;on is he every-where made to treat je&s;ts on &s;acred things and &s;ubjects, even down to the My|thology of the Pagans, among Pagans, as undoubted marks of the ill-breeding of the je&s;ters; ob&s;cene images and talk, as liberties too &s;hameful for even Rakes to allow them&s;elves in; and inju&s;tice to creditors, and in matters of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> as what it was beneath him to be guilty of.</P>
<P>Some have objected to the meekne&s;s, to the tame|ne&s;s, as they will have it to be, of the character of Mr. Hickman. And yet Lovelace owns, that he ro&s;e upon him with great &s;pirit in the interview between them; once, when he thought a reflection was but implied on <HI>Mi&s;s Howe</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VI. p. 207.</NOTE>; and another time, when he imagined <HI>him&s;elf</HI> treated contemptuou&s;ly <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VI. p. 210.</NOTE>. Mi&s;s Howe, it mu&s;t be owned (tho' not to the credit of her own character) treats him ludicrou&s;ly on &s;everal occa&s;ions. But &s;o &s;he does her Mother. And per|haps a Lady of her lively turn would have treated as

<P>And as to Lovelace's treatment of him, the Reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that it was his way to treat every man with contempt, partly by way of &s;elf-exaltation, and partly to gratify the natural gaiety of his di&s;po&s;i|tion. He &s;ays him&s;elf to Belford <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. p. 199.</NOTE>,

<P>But, as Mi&s;s Howe treats her Mother as freely as &s;he does her Lover; &s;o does Mr. Lovelace take &s;till greater liberties with Mr. Belford, than he does with Mr. Hickman, with re&s;pect to his per&s;on, air, and addre&s;s, as Mr. Belford him&s;elf hints to Mr. Hick|man <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VII. p. 315.</NOTE>. And yet he is not &s;o readily believed to the di&s;credit of Mr. Belford, by the Ladies in general, as he is when he di&s;parages Mr. Hickman. Whence can this partiality ari&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Belford had been a Rake: But was in a way of reformation.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="207" REF="216">Neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t be owned, that it was not pro|po&s;ed to draw Mr. Hickman, as the man of whom the Ladies in general were likely to be very fond. Had it been &s;o, <HI>Goodne&s;s of heart,</HI> and <HI>Gentlene&s;s of manners, great A&s;&s;iduity,</HI> and <HI>inviolable</HI> and <HI>mode&s;t</HI> Love, would not of them&s;elves have been &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient recom|mendations. He would not have been allowed the lea&s;t &s;hare of <HI>preci&s;ene&s;s</HI> or <HI>formality,</HI> altho' tho&s;e de|fects might have been imputed to his reverence for the object of his pa&s;&s;ion: But in his character it was de&s;igned to &s;hew, that the &s;ame man could not be every-thing; and to intimate to Ladies, that in chu&s;ing companions for life, they &s;hould rather prefer the ho|ne&s;t heart of a Hickman, which would be all their own, than to ri&s;que the chance of &s;haring, perhaps with &s;cores, (and &s;ome of tho&s;e probably the mo&s;t profligate of the Sex) the volatile mi&s;chievous one of a Love|lace: In &s;hort, that they &s;hould chu&s;e, if they wi&s;hed for durable happine&s;s, for rectitude of mind, and not for &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of per&s;on or addre&s;s: Nor make a je&s;t of a good man in favour of a bad one, who would make a je&s;t of them and of their whole Sex.</P>
<P>Two Letters, however, by way of accommodation, are in&s;erted in this edition, which perhaps will give Mr. Hickman's character &s;ome heightening with &s;uch Ladies, as love &s;pirit in a man; and had rather &s;uffer by it, than not meet with it.&mdash;

<P>Some have wi&s;hed that the Story had been told in the u&s;ual narrative way of telling Stories de&s;igned to amu&s;e and divert, and not in Letters written by the re&s;pective per&s;ons who&s;e hi&s;tory is given in them. The Author thinks he ought not to pre&s;cribe to the ta&s;te of others; but imagined him&s;elf at liberty to follow his own. He perhaps mi&s;tru&s;ted his talents for the nar|rative
<PB N="208" REF="217">
kind of writing. He had the good fortune to &s;ucceed in the Epi&s;tolary way once before. A Story in which &s;o many per&s;ons were concerned either prin|cipally or collaterally, and of characters and di&s;po&s;itions &s;o various, carried on with tolerable connexion and per&s;picuity, in a &s;eries of Letters from different per|&s;ons, without the aid of digre&s;&s;ions and epi&s;odes foreign to the principal end and de&s;ign, he thought had <HI>no|velty</HI> to be pleaded for it: And that, in the pre&s;ent age, he &s;uppo&s;ed would not be a &s;light recommenda|tion.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides what has been &s;aid above, and in the <HI>Preface,</HI> on this head, the following opinion of an in|genious and candid Foreigner, on this manner of writing, may not be improperly in&s;erted here.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The method which the Author has pur&s;ued in the Hi&s;tory of Clari&s;&s;a, is the &s;ame as in the Life of Pamela: Both are related in familiar Letters by the parties them&s;elves, at the very time in which the events happened: And this method has given the au|thor great advantages, which he could not have drawn from any other &s;pecies of narration. The minute par|ticulars of events, the &s;entiments and conver&s;ation of the parties, are, upon this plan, exhibited with all the warmth and &s;pirit, that the pa&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre|dominant at the very time, could produce, and with all the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics which memory can &s;upply in a Hi&s;tory of recent tran&s;actions.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Romances in general, and Marivaux's among&s;t others, are wholly improbable; becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e the Hi&s;tory to be written after the &s;eries of events is clo&s;ed by the cata&s;trophe: A circum&s;tance which im|plies a &s;trength of memory beyond all example and probability in the per&s;ons concerned, enabling them, at the di&s;tance of &s;everal years, to relate all the parti|culars of a tran&s;ient conver&s;ation: Or rather, it im|plies a yet more improbable confidence and famili|arity between all the&s;e per&s;ons and the author.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="218">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'There is, however, one difficulty attending the Epi&s;tolary method; for it is nece&s;&s;ary, that all the characters &s;hould have an uncommon ta&s;te for this kind of conver&s;ation, and that they &s;hould &s;uffer no event, nor even a remarkable conver&s;ation, to pa&s;s, without immediately committing it to writing. But for the pre&s;ervation of the Letters <HI>once written,</HI> the author has provided with great judgment, &s;o as to render this circum&s;tance highly probable <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This quotation is tran&s;lated from a CRITIQUE on the HISTORY of CLARISSA, written in French, and publi&s;hed at Am&s;terdam.

<P>It is pre&s;umed that what this gentleman &s;ays of the difficulties attending a Story thus given in the Epi&s;to|lary manner of writing, will not be found to reach the Hi&s;tory before us. It is very well accounted for in it, how the two principal Female characters come to take &s;o great a delight in writing. Their &s;ubjects are not merely &s;ubjects of amu&s;ement; but greatly intere&s;ting to both: Yet many Ladies there are who now lauda|bly corre&s;pond, when at di&s;tance from each other, on occa&s;ions that far le&s;s affect their mutual welfare and friend&s;hips, than tho&s;e treated of by the&s;e Ladies. The two principal gentlemen had motives of gaiety and vain-glory for their inducements. It will generally be found, that per&s;ons who have talents for familiar write|ing, as the&s;e corre&s;pondents are pre&s;umed to have, will not forbear amu&s;ing them&s;elves with their pens, on le&s;s arduous occa&s;ions than what offer to the&s;e. The&s;e FOUR (who&s;e Stories have a connexion with each other) out of a great number of characters which are introduced in this Hi&s;tory, are only eminent in the Epi&s;tolary way: The re&s;t appear but as occa&s;ional writers, and as drawn in rather by nece&s;&s;ity than

<P>Some there are, and Ladies too! who have &s;uppo&s;ed that the excellencies of the Heroine are carried to an improbable, and even to an impracticable height, in this Hi&s;tory. But the education of Clari&s;&s;a from <HI>early childhood</HI> ought to be con&s;idered, as one of her very great advantages; as, indeed, the foundation of <HI>all</HI> her excellencies: And it is hoped, for the &s;ake of the doctrine de&s;igned to be inculcated by it, that it will.</P>
<P>She had a pious, a well-re'd, a not meanly-de|&s;cended woman for her Nur&s;e, who with her milk, as Mrs. Harlowe &s;ays <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. IV. p. 34.</NOTE>, gave her that nurture which no other Nur&s;e could give her. She was very early happy in the conver&s;ation-vi&s;its of her learned and worthy Dr. Lewen, and in her corre&s;pondencies, not with him only, but with other Divines mentioned in her la&s;t Will. Her Mother was, upon the whole, a good woman, who did credit to her birth and her fortune; and <HI>both</HI> delighted in her for tho&s;e improve|ments and attainments, which gave her, <HI>and them in her,</HI> a di&s;tinction that cau&s;ed it to be &s;aid, that when &s;he was out of the family, it was con&s;idered but as a common family <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VII. p. 37. See al&s;o her Mother's prai&s;es of her to Mrs. Norton, Vol. I. p. 258.</NOTE>. She was moreover a Country Lady; and, as we have &s;een in Mi&s;s Howe's charac|ter of her <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VII. p. 385.</NOTE>, took great delight in rural and hou&s;|hold employments; tho' qualified to adorn the brighte&s;t circle.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we are not to look for <HI>Clari&s;&s;a's</HI> among the <HI>con&s;tant frequenters</HI> of Ranelagh and Vaux-hall, nor among tho&s;e who may be called <HI>Daughters of the Card-table.</HI> If we do, the character
<PB N="211" REF="220">
of our Heroine may then indeed be ju&s;tly thought not only improbable, but unattainable. But we have nei|ther room in this place, nor inclination, to pur&s;ue a &s;ubject &s;o invidious. We quit it therefore, after we have <HI>repeated,</HI> that we <HI>know</HI> there are <HI>&s;ome,</HI> and we <HI>hope</HI> there are <HI>many,</HI> in the Briti&s;h dominions [or they are hardly any-where in the European world] who, as far as <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> has called upon them to exert the like <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>mode&s;t,</HI> yet <HI>&s;teady</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> virtues, have reached the perfections of a Clari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly taken notice of the mo&s;t mate|rial objections that have been made to different parts of this Hi&s;tory, it is hoped we may be allowed to add, That had we thought our&s;elves at liberty to give copies of &s;ome of the many Letters that have been written on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that is to &s;ay, in appro|bation of the Cata&s;trophe, and of the general Conduct and Execution of the work, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent judges of compo&s;ition in every branch of Litera|ture; mo&s;t of what has been written in this Po&s;t&s;cript might have been &s;pared.</P>
<P>But as the principal objection with many has lain again&s;t the length of the piece, we &s;hall add to what we have &s;aid above on that &s;ubject, in the words of one of tho&s;e eminent writers:

<HEAD>Advice and Cautions to Women.</HEAD>
<ITEM>EVery one's eyes are upon the conduct, the vi&s;its, the vi&s;itors, of a young Lady made early independent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Encroaching and de&s;igning men make an artillery of a woman's hopes and fears, and play it upon her at their plea&s;ure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Artful men frequently endeavour to entangle thoughtle&s;s wo|men by bold &s;uppo&s;als and offers, and, if not checked, to reckon upon &s;ilence as conce&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women &s;hould be cautious how they give up their own Sex in conver&s;ation with the other, in articles that relate to delicacy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women, however prudent and re&s;erved, &s;hould be careful that they do not give the man they intend to encourage, rea&s;on to think that they balance on other competitions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Men who want to get a woman into their power, &s;eldom &s;cruple the means.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman who lends an ear to a Seducer, may, by <HI>gentle</HI> words, be <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly</HI> drawn in to the perpetration of the mo&s;t <HI>violent</HI> acts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>When women once enter them&s;elves as Lovers, there is hardly any receding.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="219" REF="227">The man can have no good de&s;ign, who affects to a meek-&s;pi|rited woman an anger which is evidently manageable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A daughter ought to look upon a man, who would tempt her to go off with him clande&s;tinely, as the vile&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h of &s;educers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The woman who will corre&s;pond with a known Libertine, in|directly defies him to do his wor&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman who is above flattery, and de&s;pi&s;es all prai&s;e, but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart, is, <HI>morally &s;peaking,</HI> out of the reach of &s;eduction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women ought to be careful not to give cau&s;e to the man they love to think lightly of them, for favours, granted even to him|&s;elf, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pring from natural weakne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women ought not to think gentlene&s;s of heart de&s;picable in a man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That man's natural di&s;po&s;ition is to be &s;u&s;pected, who&s;e po|litene&s;s is not regular, nor con&s;tant, nor wrought into habit; but appears only in fits, &s;tarts, and &s;ailles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>An acknowleged Love &s;anctifies every little freedom, and little freedoms beget great ones.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To give a woman an high opinion of her own &s;agacity, is the mea&s;ure that a de&s;igning man often takes to bring her to his will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>I love, when I dig a pit, <HI>&s;ays Lovelace,</HI> to have my prey tumble in with &s;ecure feet and open eyes; for then a man can look down upon her with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there?</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman in court&s;hip, for her own &s;ake, &s;hould &s;o behave to the man &s;he intends to marry, as to &s;hew the world, that &s;he thinks him worthy of re&s;pect.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Libertines con&s;ider all tho&s;e of the Sex, over whom they obtain a power, as fair prize.</ITEM>
<ITEM>There &s;eldom can be <HI>peculiarity</HI> in the Love of a raki&s;h heart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>If a woman be not angry at indecent pictures or ver&s;es &s;hewn her by a Libertine, but &s;miles at them, &s;he may blame her&s;elf, if &s;he &s;uffer from his after-attempts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Even innocent freedoms are not to be allowed to a Libertine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To be puni&s;hed by the con&s;equences of our own choice, what a moral, <HI>in&s;ultingly &s;ays Lovelace,</HI> lies there!</ITEM>
<ITEM>A judgment may be generally formed of the reading part of the Sex by their books,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The man who complains of the di&s;tance a Lady keeps him at, wants to come <HI>too near.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One conce&s;&s;ion to a man is but a prelude to another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The confidence which a woman places in a man for his re&s;pect|ful behaviour to her, ought to be withdrawn the moment that &s;he &s;ees in him an abatement of that reverence or re&s;pect, which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gat her confidence.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="220" REF="228">A man who means honourably will not be fond of treading in crooked paths.</ITEM>
<ITEM>How vain a thing is it for a woman, who has put her&s;elf into the power of a man, to &s;ay what the <HI>will</HI> or will <HI>not</HI> do!</ITEM>
<ITEM>How can a woman, who (treating <HI>her&s;elf</HI> unpolitely) gives a man an opportunity to run away with her, expect him to treat her politely?</ITEM>
<ITEM>The man who makes a flagrant, tho' un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, and is forgiven, or expo&s;tulated with, meets with encouragement to renew it at an opportunity which he may think more favour|able.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women of penetration, falling <HI>accidentally</HI> into company with a Libertine and his a&s;&s;ociates, will make them reflecting-gla&s;&s;es to one another for her own &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One devious &s;tep at fir&s;t &s;etting out frequently leads a per&s;on into a wilderne&s;s of doubt and error.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The man who is backward in urging a Lady to give him her hand at the Altar, ought not to pre&s;s her to favour him with it at public entertainments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Libertines, in order the better to carry on their de&s;igns upon the unwary of the Female Sex, <HI>particularly again&s;t tho&s;e who are prudi&s;h,</HI> frequently make pretences to <HI>Platonic Love.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>If a woman &s;uffers her Lover to &s;ee &s;he is loth to di&s;oblige him, let her beware of an encroacher.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Libertine, who by his &s;pecious behaviour has laid a&s;leep a woman's &s;u&s;picion and caution, is in the way to complete all his views.</ITEM>
<ITEM>If a woman will keep company with a man who has rea&s;on to think him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected by her, <HI>I am &s;ure, &s;ays Lovelace,</HI> it is a very hopeful &s;ign.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Women are apt to allow too much to a kneeling Lover.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Nine parts in ten of women who fall, <HI>&s;ays Lovelace,</HI> owe their di&s;grace to their own vanity or levity, or want of circum&s;pection and proper re&s;erve.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Libertines, <HI>equally tyrannical and &s;u&s;picious,</HI> expect that a wife &s;hould have no will, no eyes, no love, no hate, but at their di|rection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Travelling together gives opportunities of familiarity betwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Sexes, <HI>&s;ays Lovelace. Women therefore &s;hould be choice of the company they travel with.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Women &s;hould be early taught to think highly of their Sex, for pride, <HI>as Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lace &s;ays,</HI> is an excellent &s;ub&s;titute for virtue.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman of the brighte&s;t talents, who throws her&s;elf into the power of a Libertine, brings into que&s;tion tho&s;e talents, as well as her di&s;cretion, not only with him&s;elf, but with his lewd com|panions, to whom, in &s;ecret triumph, he will be proud to &s;hew his prize.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="221" REF="229">A mode&s;t woman fallen into gro&s;s company &s;hould avow her correctives by her eye, and not affect ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed,</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman who has put her&s;elf into the power of a de&s;igning man, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with very poor excu&s;es and pretences, for delay of marriage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Want of power is the only bound that a libertine puts to his views upon any of the Sex.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A fallen woman is the more inexcu&s;eable, as, from the cradle, the Sex is warned again&s;t the delu&s;ions of men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Men pre&s;ume greatly on the liberties taken, and laughed off, in Romping.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A Lady con&s;cious of dignity of per&s;on &s;hould mingle with it a &s;weetne&s;s of manners, to make her&s;elf beloved, as well as re&s;pect|ed, by all who approach her.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A man who in&s;ults the mode&s;ty of a woman, as good as tells her, that he has &s;een &s;omething in her conduct, that warranted his pre&s;umption.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A man who has offered the la&s;t indignity to a woman, yet ex|pects forgivene&s;s from her, mu&s;t think <HI>her</HI> as weak as <HI>be</HI> is wicked.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The woman who behaves with di&s;re&s;pect, either to her accepted Lover, or to her Hu&s;band, gives every vain man hope of &s;tanding well with her.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Clari&s;&s;a apprehends that Lovelace might have ground to doubt her conduct, from having been able to prevail upon her to cor|re&s;pond with him again&s;t paternal prohibition, and the light of her own judgment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The nice&s;t circum&s;tances cannot be too nice to be attended to by women who are obliged either to conver&s;e or corre&s;pond with free livers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A woman who, when attempted, de&s;cends to <HI>expo&s;tulation,</HI> lets the offender know, that &s;he intends to forgive him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A man, whatever are his profe&s;&s;ions, always thinks the <HI>wor&s;e</HI> of a woman, who forgives him for making an attempt on her virtue.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A man, who offers indecencies to a woman, depends for &s;e|crecy and forgivene&s;s upon his own confidence, and her ba&s;hful|ne&s;s.</ITEM>

<ITEM>She who puts her&s;elf out of a natural protection, is not to ex|pert miracles in her favour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The woman who hopes to reclaim a Libertine, <HI>may</HI> have rea&s;on to compare her&s;elf to one, who, attempting to &s;ave a drowning wretch, is drawn in after him, and peri&s;hes with him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Men take great advantages of even women of character, who
<PB N="222" REF="230">
can bear their free talk and boa&s;ts of Libertini&s;m without re&s;ent|ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cha&s;tity, like piety, is an uniform grace. If in look, if in &s;peech, a girl give way to undue levity, depend upon it, <HI>&s;ays Lovelace,</HI> the devil has already got one of his cloven &s;eet in her heart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That woman mu&s;t be indeed unhappy, who&s;e conduct has laid her under obligations to a man's &s;ilence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A bold man's effrontery in company of women mu&s;t be owing to his low opinion of them, and his high one of him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A <HI>good</HI> woman who vows duty to a wicked man, knowing him to be &s;uch, puts to hazard her eternal happine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>How dreadfully &s;unk is the woman who &s;upplicates for mar|riage to a man who has robbed her of her honour; and who can be thankful to him for doing her &s;uch poor ju&s;tice!</ITEM>
<ITEM>How mu&s;t &s;uch a one appear before <HI>his,</HI> friends and <HI>her own,</HI> di|ve&s;ted of that noble confidence which ari&s;es from a mind uncon|&s;cious of de&s;erving reproach!</ITEM>

<ITEM>It mu&s;t cut to the heart a thoughtful Mother, who&s;e Hu&s;band continues in his profligate cour&s;es, to look round upon her Chil|dren, with the reflection that &s;he has given them a Father de&s;tin'd without a miracle to perdition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>It would be as unpardonable in a Lady, <HI>&s;ays Lovelace (in the true Libertine &s;pirit)</HI> to break her word with me, as it would be &s;trange, if I kept mine to her. In Love-ca&s;es I mean; for as to the re&s;t, I am an hone&s;t moral man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>If a woman is con&s;cious of having &s;hewn weakne&s;s to a man wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has in&s;ulted her mode&s;ty, &s;he may then come to a compo&s;i|tion with him, and forgive him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>I never knew a man, <HI>&s;ays Mi&s;s Howe,</HI> who de&s;erved to be thought well of for his morals, who had a &s;light opinion of our Sex in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>If a woman con&s;ents to go off with a man, and he prove ever &s;o great a villain to her, &s;he mu&s;t take into her own bo&s;om [<HI>the whole reproach, and</HI>] a &s;hare of his guilty ba&s;ene&s;s.</ITEM>
