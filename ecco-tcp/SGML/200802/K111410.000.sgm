<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FEW of the readers of the pre&s;ent voyages, it may be pre&s;umed, are wholly unacquainted with the di&s;coveries immediately preceding it; di&s;coveries, if we may credit the relater,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"far greater than tho&s;e of all the navigators in the world collectively, from the expedi|tion of Columbus, to the pre&s;ent time."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Hawke&s;worth's dedication to the king.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Without que&s;tioning the truth of this intimation, which, no doubt, like other truths conveyed to the ear of maje&s;ty, is founded on the mo&s;t authentic evidence, we may be permitted to remark, that great as the&s;e di&s;coveries were, they &s;till left room for a new expedition, in order to accompli&s;h the GRAND DISCOVERY, with re&s;pect to which all former di&s;co|veries appear as a faint light, compared to the brightne&s;s of the cleare&s;t day.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3">Mr. Bankes, on being made acquaint|ed with this unfavourable report made to his Maje&s;ty, ordered his &s;tores to be brought on &s;hore, as did Dr. Solander, Dr. Lind, Mr. Zoffani, and five draught&s;|men that had been engaged by Mr. Bankes, for the purpo&s;e of delineating the cu|rio&s;ities of every kind that might be di&s;|covered in the cour&s;e of the voyage; a voyage patronized by Parliament, as well as by Royal Bounty, the Commons hav|ing voted 4000 l. to Dr. Lind, for his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in it; and to make it &s;till more memorable, medals were ordered to be &s;truck for it in bra&s;s, and Mr. Bankes was at the expence of a few in gold and &s;ilver. Dr. Lind, from a point of delicacy, re|&s;igned his parliamentary appointment, to accompany his friend Mr. Bankes in a private expedition to the northern i&s;les, with a view, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to examine the analogy of nature in its productions in the oppo&s;ite latitudes of the Southern and Northern Hemi&s;pheres.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, on the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e gentlemen, the voyage, though in|terrupted,
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
was not laid a&s;ide. The Re|&s;olution not being thought capable of pa&s;|&s;ing the flats, was by the Pilot brought back to Sheerne&s;s to be cut down, and the Adventure, the command of which had been given to Mr. Furneaux, &s;econd Lieutenant of the Dolphin in her &s;econd voyage that was to accompany her, was ordered round to Plymouth, there to wait the arrival of the Re&s;olution, when re&s;tored to her former condition. Du|ring this interval, no other alterations took place in the appointments of either &s;hip, but that John Reinhold For&s;ter and his &s;on, were promoted in the room of Dr. Lind, with the parliamentary encourage|ment.</P>
<P>Matters being thus far &s;ettled, the two &s;hips were ordered to be got in readine&s;s with the utmo&s;t expedition, and to be vic|tualled and provided with all manner of nece&s;&s;aries for a three years voyage; the&s;e orders were punctually obeyed, and as we are informed, Captain Cooke was permit|ted to &s;uperintend the execution. The
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
&s;hips were likewi&s;e furni&s;hed with innu|merable articles of &s;mall value, adapted to the commerce of the tropical i&s;lands.</P>
<P>It had been urged as a rea&s;on for former di&s;appointments, that the Com|manders were too &s;traitly confined by their commi&s;&s;ions, and that being re|&s;tricted by the tenor of their in&s;tructions within the limits of certain latitudes, they mu&s;t have been an&s;werable for the lo&s;s of the &s;hips with which they were entru&s;ted, had any di&s;a&s;ter happened to them beyond the latitudes pre&s;cribed. to obviate all pretences of this kind in the pre&s;ent expedition, it is &s;aid, that his Maje&s;ty recommended to his Board of Admiralty a commi&s;&s;ion of a more libe|ral kind, empowering Capt. Cooke, and, in ca&s;e of death, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to pur&s;ue at di&s;cretion the object he had in charge.</P>
<P>To this, and to the mea&s;ures that were taken, however &s;ecretly or artfully con|ducted, to &s;hake off in the beginning the cumber&s;ome train of numerous attend|ants, it is, that we owe the &s;ucce&s;s of a voyage, which, whether we con&s;ider it in a geographical or nautical light, we
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
will not he&s;itate a moment to pronounce one of the mo&s;t important that ever was performed in any age, or by any country.</P>
<P>This declaration, we hope, the great navigator by whom it was conducted, will pardon from a man, who, though a &s;tranger to his per&s;on, cannot help ad|miring his &s;kill, his fortitude, his care of his men, his vigilance in attending to the minute&s;t intimations of former voyagers, his per&s;everance amid&s;t the dangers and hard&s;hips of rigorous &s;ea|&s;ons; his prowe&s;s in leading his com|pany ju&s;t &s;o far as they were capable of proceeding: in &s;hort, his conduct throughout, which, while he kept every man &s;ingly in &s;trict obedience to his duty, he conciliated the affections of all, and &s;ecured their e&s;teem: yet with all the&s;e powers which entitle him to the rank of a great Commander, it may be fairly inferred, that had the fir&s;t inten|tions taken place,&mdash;had the train of gen|tlemen with their attendants occupied the chief accommodations of the &s;hip, it would have been out of the power of the mo&s;t determined officer to have car|ried
<PB N="x" REF="7">
&s;uch a princely retinue through the icey regions, which they were to pa&s;s without murmur, or perhaps mutiny. Be this, however, as it may, it now fully appears, that the very able navigator made choice of by his Maje&s;ty for this important &s;ervice, was alone in every re&s;pect equal to the talk in which he was embarked. Superior genius can ne|ver di&s;play it&s;elf to the utmo&s;t advantage while under the check even of pruden|tial controul; but when left at large to expand its powers, it &s;eldom fails to perform wonders, and to accompli&s;h the greate&s;t undertakings.</P>
<P>We have indeed been told, and there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe it true, that a different cour&s;e would have been pur&s;ued had Mr. Bankes and his a&s;&s;o|ciates taken part in the voyage; and that in&s;tead of running to New Zealand, New Holland would have been their place of general rendezvous. There, it is &s;aid, they intended to have prolonged their &s;tay during the winter months of that hemi&s;phere, in order, as at Ottaheitte formerly, to have cultivated an acquaint|ance
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
with the natives, a new race of men, and to have examined the natural productions of the country; to have traced the arts and manners of the inha|bitants of the different divi&s;ions, and to have delineated their per&s;ons, habits, warlike in&s;truments, &s;hipping, &amp;c. with the rarities of every kind, that by their enquiries they could obtain, or by their vigilance di&s;cover: and thus having ac|quired a general knowledge of the natu|ral hi&s;tory of New Holland, as the &s;um|mer approached they were to have pro|ceeded in the pro&s;ecution of the plan of government for geographical pur|po&s;es, examining the high latitudes dur|ing the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on for the di&s;covery of the new continent, and the low lati|tudes in the winter for the improvement of &s;cience: though by this plan the world would &s;till perhaps have been left in doubt as to the exi&s;tence of a new continent, yet a va&s;t country would have been laid open, of which at pre&s;ent very little is known.</P>
<P>But this plan proving abortive, it will now mo&s;t evidently appear, from the pe|ru&s;al
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
of the following &s;heets, that who|ever was the projector of the pre&s;ent plan, a more perfect could not have been devi&s;ed for deciding the point in que&s;|tion; and now, that it has been execut|ed, we will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that no propo&s;ition was ever more clearly de|mon&s;trated, than that there is no conti|nent undi&s;covered in the &s;outhern hemi|&s;phere between the equator and the 50th degree of &s;outhern latitude, in which &s;pace all who have contended for its ex|i&s;tence have included, if not the whole, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part. But at the &s;ame time that we declare our|&s;elves thus clearly convinced of the non-exi&s;tence of a continent within the limits ju&s;t mentioned, we cannot help acknow|ledging our ready belief that the land our navigators di&s;covered to the &s;outh|ea&s;tward of Staten Land, is part of a continent projecting from the north in a narrow neck, and expanding to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward, in like manner as the South American continent takes its ri&s;e in the &s;outh, and enlarges as it advances northward, more particularly
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
towards the ea&s;t. In this belief we are &s;trengthened by the &s;trong repre&s;entation of land &s;een at a di&s;tance by our naviga|tors, in lat. 72 and long. 252, and by the report of Theodore Gerrards, who after pa&s;&s;ing the &s;traits of Magellan, be|ing driven by tempe&s;ts into the latitude of 64 S. in that height came in &s;ight of a country mountainous and covered with &s;now, looking like Norway, and &s;eem|ingly extending from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The&s;e facts corroborate each other; and though they do not reduce the que&s;tion to an ab&s;olute certainty, yet the proba|bility is greatly in favour of the new di&s;|covery.</P>

<HEAD>VOYAGE TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE</HEAD>
<P>ALL things being in readine&s;s, as already related, on the 13th of July they &s;ailed from Plymouth, both &s;hips in company, and on the 20th of the &s;ame month came in &s;ight of Cape Fini&s;terre, bearing W. S. W. &s;even or eight leagues.</P>
<P>On the 22d they pa&s;&s;ed two Spani&s;h men of war, one of which fired two &s;hot at the Adven|ture, to oblige her to bring to; but on hailing her, and being told they were king's &s;hips, made a proper apology, and very politely took leave, wi&s;hing them a good voyage.</P>
<P>On the 28th about nine at night, they came to, and anchored in Madeira road without the lea&s;t incident worth relating intervening. Here the captains and commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and &s;uch of the petty officers and private men as had money or marketable commodities, fur|ni&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;uch &s;tocks of wine as
<PB N="2" REF="15">
they judged nece&s;&s;ary for their future u&s;e dur|ing the voyage, or could conveniently pur|cha&s;e; and having al&s;o filled their empty ca&s;ks with water, and &s;towed them on board, they proceeded on their voyage with a plea&s;ant gale.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t they lo&s;t &s;ight of Ma|deira, and on the 4th &s;aw the plea&s;ant i&s;land of Palma, bearing S. S. W. di&s;tance about three or four leagues.</P>
<P>On the 8th they cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic of Can|cer, in lat. 23 deg. 30 min. N. long. 19 deg. 11 min. W. and at nine in the morning came in &s;ight of the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta, bearing S. W. by W. &s;ix or &s;even miles.</P>
<P>On the 12th about five in the morning, they pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;le of May, and at two in the after|noon came to, and ca&s;t anchor in Port &agrave; Priege bay in the i&s;land of St. Jago, where they &s;alut|ed the Governor with 11 four-pounders. Here they &s;upplied both &s;hips with plenty of good water, and here they recruited their live &s;tock, &s;uch as hogs, goats, and poultry, &s;ome of which continued alive during the remainder of the voyage. This i&s;land is perhaps one of the mo&s;t plentiful in the whole world, and yet the inhabitants are mi&s;erable poor, owing no doubt to the tyranny of their Governors.</P>
<P>On the 14th about ten at night both &s;hips weighed anchor, and continued their voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, where, on the con|trary,
<PB N="3" REF="16">
the European inhabitants are almo&s;t all rich; for, certain it is, that though the country round the Dutch &s;ettlement at the Cape is bar|ren almo&s;t to a degree of &s;terility, yet by the &s;teady per&s;everance of that &s;low people in one invariable cour&s;e of cultivation, they have ren|dered the &s;pot on which they are &s;ettled, in &s;pight of nature, fruitful; and have brought it to &s;uch a fertile &s;tate as not only to produce all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but even many of its de|licacies too. Here every thing may be purcha&s;|ed for money, which at St. Jago the mi&s;erable inhabitants are glad to exchange for rags and old cloaths; but it is not a little money that will content a Dutchman for a convenience of which he knows an Engli&s;hman is in want.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened on board ei|ther of the &s;hips in this long run, except that the Re&s;olution lo&s;t the carpenter's mate, who unfortunately fell over-board and was drown|ed; and the Adventure two very hopeful young officers, Mr. John Limbrich, and Mr. Samuel Kemp, mid&s;hipmen, by death. The&s;e were &s;everally committed to the ocean after the manner of the &s;olemnity u&s;ed at &s;ea, and their cloaths and &s;ea &s;tores &s;old by auction be|fore the ma&s;t, for the benefit of their heirs.</P>
<P>Two men were likewi&s;e puni&s;hed on board the Adventure; one a private marine for quar|relling with the quarter-ma&s;ter; the other a
<PB N="4" REF="17">
common &s;ailor for theft: each of them receiv|ed twelve la&s;hes, which is no otherwi&s;e of im|portance to mention, except to &s;hew what &s;trict di&s;cipline it was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve on board the &s;hips, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a regular and peaceable behaviour in &s;uch hazardous voyages, where men unaccu&s;tomed to controul are but too apt to prove mutinous.</P>
<P>On the 30th of Augu&s;t both &s;hips in com|pany came to an anchor in Table-bay, where in a few days they were joined by a French &s;hip from the Mauritius, and two Dutch &s;hips from Middleburgh; the&s;e la&s;t, having been four months on their pa&s;&s;age, had lo&s;t no le&s;s than 200 men by fevers and other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Here the captains were cordially received by the old Dutch Governor, &s;aid to be one of the polite&s;t, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t friendly men in any part of the known world. Being told they were upon di&s;covery, he gave them a general invitation to his table during their &s;tay at the Cape, openly and candidly imparted to them all the information he had been able to collect concerning the &s;outhern continent, of which &s;o much had been &s;aid and written; and before their departure, he did them the honour to dine on board the Re&s;olution, which was an uncommon piece of civility to gentlemen with whom he was &s;o &s;lenderly acquainted.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="18">Here both &s;hips compleated their &s;tock of provi&s;ions for the unknown voyage they were about to undertake; the articles they chiefly purcha&s;ed were pickles of various &s;orts, which were found of great u&s;e on board the Re&s;olu|tion, in preventing, with other pre&s;ervatives of the like kind, the effects of the &s;curvy from ma|king the u&s;ual havock among the men. Bread, which is e&s;teemed the be&s;t that can be purcha&s;ed for long voyages; beef, which con&s;idering the warmth of the climate, is cured to admira|tion; arrack, brandy, and &s;pirits, than which there are none better; the&s;e articles are all rea|&s;onable at the Cape; and as for the live-&s;tock which the officers generally recruit, though they are dear, they are not an object of com|plaint, as the amount is incon&s;iderable in re&s;|pect to the other nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Every thing being now fully prepared, the &s;hips clean&s;ed, and &s;moaked, and the crews in high &s;pirits, all but Lieut. Shanks, of the Ad|venture, who de&s;ired leave to return home, on the 22d of November 1773, both &s;hips took their departure from the Cape, but fir&s;t the promotion took place in the Adventure, which the re&s;ignation of Lieut. Shanks, ju&s;t mentioned, had rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Accord|ingly the 2d Lieutenant Mr. Kemp, was pro|moted to be 1&s;t Lieutenant, and Mr. Burney, mid&s;hipman, was made 2d Lieutenant.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="19">Nothing remarkable, except puni&s;hing two men on board the Adventure for neglect of duty, till the 28th, when in lat. 40 deg. 55. min. S. long. 12 deg. 6 min. E. it began to blow a &s;torm, but as the wind &s;tood fair both &s;hips continued to keep company.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of December being in lat. 43 deg. 14 min. S. long. 16 deg. 23 min. E. the &s;hips company of the Adventure, were put to two-thirds allowance of bread. Both &s;hips conti|nued their cour&s;e to the &s;outhward, and being already as far to the &s;outh, as any &s;hip had ever yet &s;ailed in that quarter, all beyond was as utterly unknown as if they had been the fir&s;t &s;hips that had ever navigated the South-Seas.</P>
<P>On the 10th they came in &s;ight of two i&s;|lands of ice, which they took to be land, but when they bore down to them, they were &s;oon convinced of their mi&s;take. Lat. 49 deg. 39 min. long. 21 deg. 20 min. E.</P>
<P>On the 22d they came in &s;ight of &s;o many i&s;lands of ice that it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty that they could avoid them. Here they fir&s;t ob&s;erved flocks of penguins hovering about the ice-i&s;lands. Some of the&s;e i&s;lands appeared to be three or four miles in circum|ference, &s;ome more; but by far the greate&s;t number appeared like the ruins of antient towns, or the fragments of gothic ca&s;tles. As the air was clear and the weather fine, &s;everal
<PB N="7" REF="20">
of the gentlemen in both &s;hips diverted them|&s;elves with &s;hooting penguins, and the &s;ai|lors had no le&s;s plea&s;ure in eating them, than the gentlemen had in killing them, for the of|ficers were not yet come to reli&s;h &s;uch rank food. Short allowance and &s;alt provi&s;ions are certain|ly the be&s;t remedies in the world for delicate &s;tomachs: the officers before their return could eat penguins as well as the men. Lat. 54 deg. 52 min. long. 29 deg. 1 min. E.</P>
<P>On the 26th they were every where &s;urround|ed with i&s;lands of ice, in&s;omuch that it was with the utmo&s;t danger that they continued their cour&s;e. The crews of both &s;hips were in per|fect health, but the fatigue of con&s;tantly luff|ing up and bearing away to avoid being da&s;h|ed to pieces, was not borne without reluctance. This, however, was not all, for being entan|gled among the ice, their water bad, and with|all beginning to run &s;hort, it was judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to gather up the pieces of loo&s;e ice, in order to melt it to &s;upply the place of that which was taken in at St. Jago, which was now become &s;o di&s;agreeable that the &s;tronge&s;t &s;to|machs recoiled at u&s;ing it. Though this pro|ved an excellent &s;uccedaneum, and was in truth a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible refre&s;hment both to the officers and &s;eamen, yet the gratification was dearly pur|cha&s;ed by the pain of tho&s;e who&s;e lot it was to procure it; for the pieces of ice being many of
<PB N="8" REF="21">
them &s;o large that two men were hardly able to lift them into the boat, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them to plunge their arms into the water in order to get their hands under them to obtain a purcha&s;e, whereby their arms in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time put on the ap|pearance of icicles, and became &s;o numbed as for the pre&s;ent to be totally incapable of u&s;e. Yet &s;uch is the advantage of di&s;cipline, that the men would relieve each other, when com|manded on this grievous &s;ervice, with as much alacrity, as if it had been only to take their turn at the nightly watch. Lat. 61 deg. 35 min. long. 33 deg. 26 min. E.</P>
<P>Happily the weather proved moderate, &s;o that between the 1&s;t and the 12th of January 1773, they had gathered up &s;uch a quantity of ice, as when melted in the coppers, filled all the empty ca&s;ks with the be&s;t water, as your journa|li&s;ts &s;ay, they had ta&s;ted &s;ince they left England.</P>
<P>On the 14th of January they pa&s;&s;ed the Ant|artic circle, lat. 66 deg. 30 min. and in long. 37 deg. E. and now the i&s;lands of ice began to increa&s;e in &s;ize, but dimini&s;h in number, and the loo&s;e ice to be larger in dimen&s;ions and more dangerous to pa&s;s. The &s;un now &s;hewed him&s;elf about 12 at night, and as they advan|ced the &s;tars di&s;appeared, and the &s;un conti|nued to cheer them with his light till their re|turn again to the &s;ame latitude, but to their great

mortification the i&s;lands of ice which had hi|therto afforded them a pa&s;&s;age, were converted into whole fields; and on the 17th of January, being in lat. 67 deg. 10 min. S. and in lat. 38 deg. 29 min. E. they found their pa&s;&s;age totally clo&s;ed up, and were obliged to change their cour&s;e fir&s;t to the north-we&s;tward and then to the north-ea&s;tward. It is to be remarked, that they were now within 13 or 14 deg. as far to the &s;outhward as that part of the northern hemi&s;phere, where Com|modore Phipps was ice bound the following year, and where his e&s;cape was very providen|tial; that gentleman might indeed be ju&s;|tified in proceeding as he did, to the utmo&s;t extremity of danger, for though he reached con&s;i|derably farther to the north than our voyagers dur&s;t adventure to the &s;outh, yet his intrepi|dity was not more con&s;picuous; he was in known &s;eas, in &s;ight of much frequented i&s;|lands, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every comfort and every conveniency that could po&s;&s;ibly contribute to pre&s;erve life in &s;uch a &s;ituation as he might have been reduced to; and he was in a manner at home, where, had he &s;urvived the &s;everity of the winter, he had all the chance in the world to arrive early in the &s;ummer; whereas our voy|agers had no &s;uch encouragement to proceed when the ob&s;truction became vi&s;ible, and per|&s;everance threatened nothing but immediate de|&s;truction. They knew of no land within a thou|&s;and
<PB N="10" REF="24">
miles of them, they had neither cloathing nor provi&s;ions proper to winter in a remote and rigorous region; they could have no hope to &s;upport them in &s;uch deplorable circum&s;tances of meeting with any accidental relief from the appearance of any other &s;hip at &s;ea, where no &s;hip had ever attempted to navigate before; and had they or any of them been miraculou&s;ly pre|&s;erved through the winter, it mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for them to reach any known land; it would therefore not have been courage, but fool-hardine&s;s to have proceeded when every appearance was again&s;t them; nei|ther would it have an&s;wered any other purpo&s;e than gratifying idle curio&s;ity, to have di&s;cover|ed a continent beyond the 68th degree of lati|tude, where no European ever could have &s;et|tled. All things con&s;idered, the reader will conclude, that though perhaps our voyagers might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ailed a few degrees far|ther, yet they acted wi&s;ely in not ri&s;king the lives of &s;o many brave men to no one u&s;eful purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January therefore Captain Cooke made the &s;ignal to his con&s;ort to tack, and to &s;teer north-we&s;tward. In this cour&s;e many interruptions happened, hard gales came on, the &s;eas &s;hortened, the &s;hips by &s;training be|came leaky, the rigging by being frozen was continually &s;napping in one part or other, and
<PB N="11" REF="25">
it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the &s;hips could keep company.</P>
<P>On the 29th of January, being then in lat. 52 deg. 28 min. S. long. 54 deg. 4 min. E. a &s;torm came on which &s;eparated them, as it was thought, for ever. This &s;torm was attended with a prodigious fall of rain, every drop of which of the &s;ize of a common pea, the &s;ea ro&s;e to a tremendous height, and broke over the &s;hips bows to the height of the yard arms. The Adventure, after endeavouring in vain to recover the Re&s;olution, had no other means of again meeting with her, but by repairing to the fir&s;t place appointed to rendezvous in Charlotte-Bay, on the i&s;land of New-Zealand. In the mean time however &s;he kept beating the &s;eas in the mo&s;t terrible weather that any &s;hip could po&s;&s;ibly endure. In this crui&s;e, they traver&s;ed from lat. 48 deg. to 45 deg. S. and from long. 36 deg. to 146 deg. during the whole month of February, and part of March, in which time their water being near exhau&s;ted, they were reduced at la&s;t to the &s;canty allowance of a quart per man a day.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of March, having made no di&s;|covery of land in all this di&s;agreeable traver&s;e, it was determined to &s;teer to Van Dieman's land, there to take in water and repair their &s;hattered rigging.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="26">On the 9th of March they came in &s;ight of that i&s;land, bearing E. by N. di&s;tance about eight leagues. They were now in lat. 43 deg. 46 min. S. and in long. 146 deg. 36 min. E. the weather much warmer, and the &s;ea calm.</P>
<P>On the 20th they got within three miles of a fine bay, which they at fir&s;t mi&s;took for Henry Frederick's bay, and under that mi&s;take hoi&s;ted out the large cutter, and &s;ent her in &s;hore to examine the &s;oundings for anchorage for the &s;hip, and to endeavour to find a watering-place, and to bring with them an immediate &s;upply. About noon the boat returned, and brought word that they had found both wood and water, but that the latter was far from being of the be&s;t; that the wood was plenty, and the anchorage &s;afe; that they had &s;een none of the natives, nor &s;igns of any; and that the country, as far as they could &s;ee, was un|inhabited, or at lea&s;t uncultivated. The Cap|tain on this intelligence, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, came to, and moored &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 12th the boats were all properly manned, and a guard of marines &s;ent on &s;hore to protect the different parties that were em|ployed in cutting wood and filling water. Here they found trees of an incredible height and &s;ize, the immen&s;ity of which could never have been believed on the &s;ingle te&s;timony of the journali&s;t before me, had not the relations
<PB N="13" REF="27">
of Ta&s;man, Dampier, and Cooke, put the truth of the fact beyond di&s;pute. He reports that here the bodies of the trees were &s;o large that &s;ix men with their arms &s;tretched at full length could &s;carce fathom them; that they were of a proportionable height; that &s;ome of them ro&s;e more than a hundred feet high; that the common height was from eighty to ninety feet, all &s;traight, without a limb breaking out; and that in general they &s;hewed not the lea&s;t &s;igns of decay.</P>
<P>On the 13th and 14th the different parties were employed in compleating their &s;tock of wood and water; the gentlemen in reconnoi|treing the country; and the carpenters, caulk|ers, &s;ailmakers, and riggers, in repairing, as well as the &s;hort time allotted them would admit, the damages the &s;hip had &s;uffered in her crui&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 15th at five in the morning, they unmoored, and about nine took their depar|ture from the bay, which they now named the Adventure's Bay, it not appearing that any European ve&s;&s;el had ever before anchored there. It lies in lat. 43 deg. 23 min. S. long. 147 deg. 37 min. E.</P>
<P>Though during their &s;tay they had &s;een none of the natives, yet as they coa&s;ted along &s;hore they ob&s;erved many fires in the night, and &s;ome cultivated fields in the day.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28">On the 19th they lo&s;t &s;ight of this i&s;land, and &s;tretched to the north ea&s;tward for New Zealand, where they expected to meet the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>On the 22d they met with a hard gale, at|tended with thunder, lightning, and rain, which continued the greate&s;t part of the day.</P>
<P>On the 23d the &s;torm abated, and fine wea|ther &s;ucceeded, which continued during the remainder of the month.</P>
<P>On the 28th, the &s;ky being &s;erene, the wea|ther moderately warm, and the &s;ea calm, they hoi&s;ted out the &s;mall cutter, and the gentlemen went a-&s;hooting. In a few hours they came on board with four albatro&s;&s;es, the lea&s;t of which mea&s;ured 10 feet from tip to tip when their wings were &s;pread to their utmo&s;t &s;tretch.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April the weather began to alter; fre&s;h breezes came on, the rains poured plentifully down, and &s;o continued, with a few intervals of fair weather, till they came in &s;ight of New Zealand.</P>
<P>On the 3d of April at &s;ix in the morning, the man from the ma&s;t head, called out, Land, which, upon a nearer approach, they knew to be the land between Rock Point and Cape Fare|well, &s;o named by Capt. Cooke when on his return from his la&s;t voyage.</P>
<P>On the 4th they continued their cour&s;e. Nothing material happened on board, except
<PB N="15" REF="29">
that John Cavannah was puni&s;hed with twelve la&s;hes for being in&s;olent to the fir&s;t lieutenant.</P>
<P>On the 7th they came to in 10 fathom water, and next day moored &s;hip a cable each way. In the mean time they manned the large cutter, and with a proper guard &s;ent her to examine whether any tokens of the Com|modore's arrival at that harbour were to be di&s;covered. The boat returned, and brought word, that there did not appear the lea&s;t &s;ign of any &s;hip having been there from the time of the Endeavour's departure in 1770 to the pre&s;ent hour: they therefore in&s;tantly prepar|ed to &s;end the tents a&s;hore to be pitched un|der a proper guard for the accommodation of the &s;ick; and tho&s;e who were in health were very alert in catching fi&s;h, which they found in great plenty near the &s;hore, and which proved of great &s;ervice in recovering the &s;ick, to whom fre&s;h provi&s;ions were both food and phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>On the 9th there came along&s;ide the &s;hip three canoes, with 15 Indians of both &s;exes, all of them armed with battle-axes, and with other offen&s;ive weapons made of hard wood in the form of our officers &s;pontoons, about four feet in length, but neither bows nor arrows. The men had be&s;ides javelins or &s;pears between 20 and 30 feet long, made of the &s;ame hard wood with which their battle-axes were formed.
<PB N="16" REF="30">
They had no cloaths, except a &s;ort of mat wrapt round their &s;houlders, and tied about their middles with a girdle made of gra&s;s. Both men and women had a mo&s;t &s;avage ap|pearance, and were very unwilling to tru&s;t them&s;elves on board. The Captains and Of|ficers made them pre&s;ents, and by &s;igns invi|ted them to trade; they accepted the pre&s;ents and &s;ome of them took courage and came upon deck; at the &s;ame time &s;everal of the &s;ail|ors went down into their canoes, in one of which they di&s;covered the head of a man, which by its bleeding &s;eemed to be fre&s;h cut off; our men expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to be more particularly &s;atisfied, the Indians that remained in the ca|noes, with &s;urpri&s;ing dexterity, in&s;tantly con|veyed it out of &s;ight, and tho&s;e on board ob|&s;erving the di&s;covery, left the &s;hip precipitate|ly with vi&s;ible marks of di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the 10th, about eight in the morning, five canoes came along &s;ide the &s;hip with about forty Indians to trade. They brought fi&s;h, which the &s;hips company purcha&s;ed at a cheap rate. Having di&s;po&s;ed of all their cargoes about noon, they went away &s;eemingly in great good humour.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the weather continuing fair, and the Indians friendly, the Captain and Of|ficers were preparing to go a&s;hore, when about nine in the morning no le&s;s then ten canoes
<PB N="17" REF="31">
came padling down the &s;ound. They count|ed 120 natives of both &s;exes, all of them armed as before. When they came along &s;ide they &s;eemed to expre&s;s a de&s;ire to be admitted on board; but the Captain not liking their coun|tenance, gave orders, that a few only &s;hould be admitted at a time; and even the&s;e beha|ved &s;o rudely that the &s;ailors were obliged to turn them out, it having appeared that they came with a de&s;ign to make them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of the &s;hip. However, when they found the crew was upon their guard, they became more civil, but not before a great gun was fired over their heads, which was the only thing that intimidated them. Being thus reduced to order, the people on board &s;hewed them &s;eve|ral trifling articles, &s;uch as beads, nails, little cla&s;p knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, cloth, paper, and other trifles, which they exchanged with the Indians for their battle axes, &s;pears, weapons of va|rious &s;orts, fi&s;h-hooks, and other curio&s;ities, the manufacture of the country. Being vi&s;i|bly di&s;appointed in their de&s;ign, they &s;oon de|parted, all gabbling together in a language, a word of which no one on board could under|&s;tand. Previous to their departure, however, the Captain and officers made pre&s;ents to tho&s;e among them who appeared to be chiefs, which they accepted &s;eemingly very well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="32">During the remainder of the month, when the weather was fair, parties of the natives came every day to traffic; the women were per|mitted to bring their trade on board, and a friendly intercour&s;e &s;eemed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on both &s;ides. The gentlemen went every day on &s;hore, &s;ome to botoni&s;e, &s;ome to reconnoitre the country, &s;ome to &s;hoot land birds, and each to pur&s;ue that diver&s;ion with which he was mo&s;t delighted. The &s;ick recovered fa&s;t, the men were permitted by turns to go a&s;hore, but the main bu&s;ine&s;s of providing wood and water for continuing the voyage, of repairing the da|mage the &s;hip had received, and of over-haw|ling the rigging, airing the powder, &s;hifting the balla&s;t, &s;moaking and clean&s;ing the &s;hips hold, and between decks; the&s;e were matters of moment that were unremittingly attended to. In the mean time while they continued in har|bour, the men were put to 2-3ds allowance of beef, pork, and oil; the two fir&s;t articles they did not much regret, but of the la&s;t they thought it hard to be abridged, when having plenty of fi&s;h, they &s;tood mo&s;t in need of &s;auce.</P>
<P>By this time the reader, it may be pre&s;umed is in pain for the Re&s;olution, more than three months having elap&s;ed &s;ince the Adventure lo&s;t &s;ight of her. On the 18th of May, however, &s;he was &s;een to the great joy of the &s;pectators,
<PB N="19" REF="33">
at Jack&s;on's-Point, working up to the Sound, and at &s;even at night &s;he came and moored ju&s;t by the Adventure. The plea&s;ure the &s;hips companies felt at their meeting can only be conceived by tho&s;e who have been them&s;elves in like circum&s;tances; each were eager to learn the others &s;ucce&s;s, and each were as eager to relate as the others were to hear. The reader, however, is already acquainted with the pro|gre&s;s of the Adventure; what happened to the Re&s;olution remains to be related.</P>
<P>It may be recollected that the &s;hips parted company in a hard gale on the 29th of Ja|nuary in lat. 52 deg. 28 min. S. and in long. 54 deg. 4 min. E.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that their in&s;tructions were to examine the &s;eas to the &s;outhward of Die|man's-Land and New-Zealand, from W. to E. as far as they were practicable; and for that purpo&s;e having &s;ailed &s;o far to the &s;outhward as to a&s;certain with certainty the non-exi&s;tence of any continent, as far as the 68th degree of latitude in a &s;outherly direction from the Cape of Good Hope; they then changed their cour&s;e to the north-ea&s;tward till they arrived in the 50th degree of &s;outh latitude, when they again altered their cour&s;e, &s;teering ea&s;t|ward as long as they could keep the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="34">It has been already ob&s;erved, that it was on the 17th of January, which an&s;wers to the 17th of July in our hemi&s;phere, that the &s;hips reached the extreme point of their &s;outhing, and now the &s;ummer, which is but &s;hort in tho&s;e high latitudes, wa&s;ting apace, and winter approaching, rendered the utmo&s;t diligence nece&s;&s;ary to complete what they had in view before the freezing &s;ea&s;on came on. The Commodore, therefore, with great judgment and propriety, pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to the east|ward, being thoroughly convinced that if a &s;outhern continent exi&s;ted, it mu&s;t be di&s;cover|able in that direction.</P>
<P>The&s;e however are only conjectural &s;urmi&s;es, ari&s;ing from the cour&s;es which the journals be|fore me repre&s;ent. It might therefore be the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;hips to keep company, as both being appri&s;ed of the bu&s;ine&s;s about which they were employed, wanted no in&s;truc|tions from each other to pur&s;ue the main ob|ject.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem however that the Re&s;olu|tion took a larger &s;cope than the Adven|ture, keeping rather beyond the 60th degree, while the Adventure &s;eems to have kept within it.</P>
<P>It were little more than a repetition of the Adventure's di&s;tre&s;&s;es to particularize the ef|fects of the boi&s;terous weather that were felt
<PB N="21" REF="35">
by the crew of the Re&s;olution on this traver&s;e; being &s;ometimes &s;urrounded with i&s;lands of ice, out of which they could only extricate them|&s;elves by the utmo&s;t exertion of their &s;kill in &s;eaman&s;hip; &s;ometimes involved in &s;heets of &s;leet and &s;now, and in mi&s;ts &s;o dark that a man on the foreca&s;tle could not be &s;een from the quarter-deck; &s;ometimes the &s;ea rolling moun|tains high, while the running tackle, made brittle by the &s;everity of the fro&s;t, was fre|quently &s;napping, and &s;ometimes rendered immoveable by the accumulation of ice and &s;now. Amid&s;t the hard&s;hips of &s;uch a naviga|tion, there is nothing &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, as that the crew continued in perfect health, &s;carce a man being &s;o ill as to be incapable of duty. No|thing can redound more to the honour of the Commander, than his paying particular atten|tion to the pre&s;ervation of health among his crew. By ob&s;erving the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, his commands were duly ob&s;erved, and punctually executed. When the &s;ervice was hard, he tempered the &s;everity of it by frequently relieving tho&s;e em|ployed in the performance, and, having all hands at command, he was never under the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the labour of any &s;et of men beyond what their &s;trength and their &s;pirits could bear. Another nece&s;&s;ary precau|tion was, that when the weather was fine, and
<PB N="22" REF="36">
the breeze &s;teady, he never &s;uffered any of his men to be idle, but con&s;tantly employed the armourers, the carpenters, the caulkers, the &s;ailmakers, ropemakers, the other trade&s;men on board, as well as the forema&s;tmen and pro|fe&s;&s;ed navigators, in doing &s;omething each in his own way, which, though not immediately wanted, he knew there would be a call for be|fore the voyage was completed. Having by this means no time for gaming, quarrelling, or rioting among them, he kept them in action, and puni&s;hed drunkenne&s;s with the utmo&s;t &s;e|verity: and thus by per&s;evering in a &s;teady line of conduct, he pre&s;erved their health, and was enabled by that precaution to keep the &s;ea till reduced to a very &s;canty portion of wa|ter; and till de&s;pairing of finding any new land, and fully &s;atisfying him&s;elf of the non-exi&s;tence of any continent in the quarter which he had traver&s;ed, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to direct his cour&s;e to Charlotte Sound, the place appoint|ed, as has been ob&s;erved, for the &s;hips to ren|dezvous in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, but was not able to effect his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 22d of March however, having &s;een no land from the 22d of November, when he left the Cape, he came in &s;ight of the &s;outhern|mo&s;t part of New Zealand, that i&s;land being divided in the middle by a narrow &s;ound, which
<PB N="23" REF="37">
gives name to the harbour appointed for the place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>On the 25th they made land; but the wind proving contrary, they were obliged to &s;tand off all night. Finding in the morning the im|po&s;&s;ibility of bearing down to Charlotte Sound, the Captain gave orders to &s;teer to Du&s;key Bay, &s;o named in his former voyage, &s;ituate in a bay between the 45th and 46th degrees of &s;outh latitude, in which the whole navy of England might ride in &s;afety. In this bay they found a harbour &s;o cold, that they ran clo&s;e in &s;hore, and &s;teadied the &s;hip by dropping an anchor &s;hort, and fa&s;tening a large bow-line to a tree on the land. A party was immediately &s;ent out to fi&s;h, who &s;oon returned, having caught as many as were enough for a meal for the whole &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>On the 26th the &s;mall cutter was &s;ent out properly armed, in &s;earch of a convenient place to wood and water: and having di&s;co|vered a cove in which there was a fine run of water, and wood enough to &s;upply a fleet, they &s;hifted their &s;tation, and moored the &s;hip in that cove &s;o near the &s;hore, that for an ea&s;y communication with the land they erected a temporary &s;tage, one of the chief &s;upports of which grew right out from the beach.</P>
<P>On the 27th an Indian canoe came to the mouth of the cove, but was afraid to enter.
<PB N="24" REF="38">
There were four or five Indians in it, who ju&s;t peep'd in to look at the &s;hip, and ha&s;tily de|parted.</P>
<P>After dinner, Capt. Cooke, accompanied by Mr. Fo&s;ter, and attended by &s;ome of his offi|cers, having ordered out the cutter, followed the cour&s;e which the Indians &s;eemed to take, and &s;oon di&s;covered the place of their habita|tion, which however they had de&s;erted. It was a wretched hut made of the bark and boughs of trees, and in it they found a fi&s;h ready roa&s;ted, and wrapped up in leaves, and a net with which the fi&s;h was catched. The Captain left &s;ome trifles in the hut, which however the Indians never came to take away.</P>
<P>On the 28th a tent was erected for the coopers to clean&s;e and repair the water ca&s;ks. The large cutter was every day employed in fi&s;hing for the &s;hip's company; and a party was &s;ent out to kill water-fowl, of which they found great abundance.</P>
<P>On the 29th a forge was erected on &s;hore for the armourer's u&s;e, to make and mend &s;uch iron work as the carpenters wanted to repair the &s;hip. All hands, but &s;uch as had leave to fi&s;h or kill game, were bu&s;ied in different ta&s;ks about the &s;hip. As yet none of the natives appeared, the Captain every day employed &s;e|veral hours in &s;urveying the harbour, and Mr. Fo&s;ter in &s;earching the mountains and plains
<PB N="25" REF="39">
for ores and plants by land; but the weather being variable, and rain falling plentifully, re|tarded the progre&s;s of their re&s;earches, and frequently confined them to their cabins, to their no &s;mall mortification.</P>
<P>On the 3d of April as the Captain, attend|ed only by the boats crew, was taking his &s;ur|vey as u&s;ual among the i&s;lands, he perceived an aged Indian &s;tanding upon a point of land that projected a little way into the &s;ea, and ob&s;erving his motions, took notice that he &s;eemed to wave a bough which he held in his hand, as an invitation for the boat to approach the &s;hore. The Captain, who was totally un|prepared for re&s;i&s;tance, was yet under no ap|prehen&s;ions of mi&s;chief from the friendly ap|pearance of the old man; and fearle&s;s of dan|ger, cau&s;ed the boat's crew to put him on &s;hore without a companion. As &s;oon as he was landed, the Indian came forward, and &s;aluted him by gra&s;ping him by the arms, and pre&s;&s;ing him face to face. He was accompanied by a young woman who held a kind of &s;pear in her hand full eighteen feet long, and by two elderly wo|men with three or four children. They &s;eemed to be one &s;ecluded family, and by their beha|viour, not wholly de&s;titute of humanity. They were all habited nearly alike. Their hair, which was of a &s;hining black, was tied in a knot upon the crowns of their heads. Their apparel was uni|formly

<PB N="28" REF="40">
with the old man and his family to come on board the &s;hip, but it was afterwards di&s;cover|ed that &s;ome ceremonies were wanting to ratify the peace. The Indian had brought his green bough, and pre&s;ented it to the Captain, but the Captain had omitted to pre&s;ent a green bough in return. This being under&s;tood, when the Captain went next to &s;urveying, he took care to place him&s;elf in full view of the In|dians place of abode, and, as he had &s;uppo&s;ed, the old man came again to the &s;ea-&s;ide. The Cap|tain having prepared a bough on purpo&s;e, upon his approach waved it in the boat and immedi|ately rowed to land. The Indian on his landing embraced him, and having a bough in his hand, made a long &s;peech, which though not intel|ligible, was yet delivered with &s;o much grace and dignity, as would have done honour to an European orator. They then exchanged their boughs, and the old man made great profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, which tho&s;e people have many ways of expre&s;&s;ing unknown to Europeans, giving the Captain at the &s;ame time to un|der&s;tand that all manner of di&s;tru&s;t was now at an end.</P>
<P>From this time the old man came down to the &s;hip without fear; and Mr. Fo&s;ter, and tho&s;e who were curious, had frequent opportunities of vi&s;iting and conver&s;ing with the family, if that may be called conver&s;ing, when neither
<PB N="29" REF="41">
party under&s;tand a word of each others lan|guage.</P>
<P>When the old man came fir&s;t on board, he was attended only by one daughter, who was young and lively. The Captain received him with great cordiality, and the Indian &s;eemed highly delighted, in&s;pecting and admiring every thing that was &s;hewn him; both he and his daughter were invited to eat, but they de|clined that civility. While the old man was attentive to the manual arts about which the men were employed on board, the daughter was no le&s;s plea&s;ed with the playwardne&s;s of the &s;ailors, who endeavoured to make them|&s;elves agreeable to her by &s;triving who &s;hould make her the mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ents. Of all the arts the Indian &s;aw the people employed about on board, none &s;eemed to &s;trike him &s;o much as the facility with which the &s;awyers cut out their plank from the &s;olid tree; he was &s;o plea&s;ed with that operation, that he was very de&s;irous of taking the pitman's place him&s;elf; and being permitted &s;o to do, but not &s;ucceed|ing to his wi&s;h in the performance, he &s;oon gave out; but could not be diverted from at|tending to the &s;awyers, preferably to any of the other handicrafts, the carpenter's excepted, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, however, being more compli|cated he could not &s;o well comprehend.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="42">Having &s;pent mo&s;t part of the day in grati|fying his curio&s;ity; and the daughter being no le&s;s delighted than her father with the atten|tion that had been paid her, it drawing to|wards evening, they both took leave and de|parted.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time it was di&s;covered, that this family was the &s;ame, who at the fir&s;t coming of the &s;hip, de&s;erted their habitation on the &s;hore, and betook them&s;elves to the covert of the woods. On this part of the i&s;land, which was the mo&s;t &s;outherly, and con&s;equently the colde&s;t and mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing, the inhabitants were but few, and lived in continual terror. The country at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore being rude, woody and mountainous, was their chief &s;ecurity again&s;t the incur&s;ions of their northern countrymen, who if they can take them by &s;urprize, carry them off in like manner as the &s;avage bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t carry off their prey when impelled by hunger. This very naturally accounts for the de&s;erted condi|tion in which our voyagers found this part of the country; for though it abounded in fi&s;h, it was de&s;titute of every other nece&s;&s;ary of life, wood and water excepted. There were neither fowls nor animals, &s;ave &s;ea-fowls, of which la&s;t the natives were not dexterous enough to avail them&s;elves, and they had no other means of &s;upplying their want of bread, but by
<PB N="31" REF="43">
brui&s;ing the inner rind of a certain tree, and roa&s;ting it to eat with their fi&s;h. How they procured cloathing, for cloathing they had, we are yet to learn. It is no wonder therefore, that at the approach of a ve&s;&s;el of &s;uch an un|common magnitude and &s;tructure as the Re&s;o|lution, a &s;olitary family of which an old man was the &s;ole defender, &s;hould on its landing ap|pear to be frighted, probably expecting to be eaten, as they could not &s;uppo&s;e &s;trangers to have more tenderne&s;s and humanity than their own countrymen.</P>
<P>On Monday the 19th the Captain and Mr. Fo&s;ter, took a tour up the country, and in their way vi&s;ited the old man and his family at their new habitation on the &s;kirt of the wood, and were welcomed by them in a manner they did not expect. In le&s;s time than could well be imagined, they all appeared clean dre&s;&s;ed in their manner, a fire was made by rubbing two &s;ticks together, which &s;eems to be the uni|ver&s;al method in u&s;e among the natives through|out the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, and they began dre&s;&s;ing fi&s;h in a peculiar manner, intreating their gue&s;ts at the &s;ame time to &s;tay and eat; the fi&s;h they intended for the &s;trangers was dif|ferently dre&s;&s;ed from that eaten in common by them&s;elves. Having prepared the fire they made a kind of bag of a broad-leaved &s;ea-weed, in which they placed a fi&s;h about the
<PB N="32" REF="44">
&s;ize of a &s;mall cod: this fi&s;h thus inclo&s;ed, they placed upon a kind of &s;tage made of hard wood in the nature of a grid-iron, and underneath they &s;upplied live-coals as often as tho&s;e fir&s;t put under became deadened by the droppings from the &s;ea-weed; this they continued to do till the fi&s;h within became brown as if baked in an oven; and then they offered it to the &s;trangers in clean leaves gathered fre&s;h from the trees. Their bread, as has been &s;aid, was the inner bark of a tree clean&s;ed and brui&s;ed, and made up in a way peculiar to them&s;elves; and their &s;auce was a &s;ea-weed, which, it was &s;up|po&s;ed, &s;erved them both for &s;alt and vinegar. The gentlemen declined the invitation with regard to eating, but were much plea&s;ed with the neatne&s;s of their cooking; &s;ome of the &s;ailors, however, were not &s;o dainty; they not only eat with them a-days, but &s;lept with them a-nights.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 20th, the gentlemen being at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hip &s;ur|veying the different i&s;lands in the bay, and in &s;ounding the depths, and &s;ecuring a free pa&s;|&s;age for the &s;hip as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be in a condition to &s;ail, they ob&s;erved a company of Indians, who by their motions &s;eemed to be more courageous than the family we have been ju&s;t de&s;cribing. The&s;e were armed after the manner of their northern countrymen, and
<PB N="33" REF="45">
threatened ho&s;tilities by brandi&s;hing their lances. Their threats, however, had no other effect than ha&s;tening the pinnace to approach the land. The Captain, with only a &s;heet of white paper in his hand, jumped a&s;hore; and, after narrowly e&s;caping being &s;truck with a launce which was thrown at him by a young warrior, continued advancing till he reached a tree, from whence having broken a bough, he made towards the natives, who were but few in number, and who &s;eemed in a great mea&s;ure to have vented their rage in the fir&s;t attack. They met him with boughs which they dropt at his feet, and he in&s;tantly dropt his upon theirs. Peace being in this manner concluded, an exchange of &s;ome articles took place, and the Captain made pre&s;ents to the women of &s;uch trifles as they were mo&s;t likely to be plea&s;ed with, and invited them to follow him to the pinnace. They made &s;igns in return for him and his followers to go with them; but ob&s;erving more of their company peeping from the woods, he thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to return on board. He was no &s;ooner em|barked than they all came down to the water's edge, and being &s;hewn &s;everal articles of &s;mall value, they fancied mo&s;t of them, and were gratified each with what he liked be&s;t.</P>
<P>At another i&s;land more Indians were di&s;co|vered, who by waving a bird's &s;kin, made &s;igns
<PB N="34" REF="46">
for the pinnace to land; but night coming on, and the pinnace being at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the &s;hip, the Captain gave orders to &s;teer for the cove.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened till the 26th. The people continued to prepare for &s;ailing; and in the mean time the brewers were &s;et to work to brew beer for the &s;hip's u&s;e. This, it &s;eems, had been &s;trongly recommended by Mr. M'Bride as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the &s;curvy, and there is no doubt but it contributed, with the other means that were u&s;ed, to produce that &s;alutary effect. The crew continued in perfect health; and while their beer la&s;ted, preferred it to every other liquor. Mr. M'Bride, indeed, pre&s;cribes the wort as the mo&s;t effectual remedy; but the beer while new may differ very little in its quality.</P>
<P>On the 28th the tents on &s;hore were &s;truck, the wood that had been cut brought on board, and the water properly &s;towed in the hold; the &s;ails all bent, the &s;hip unmoored, and all but the Captain, and tho&s;e who accompanied him, called to their &s;tations.</P>
<P>On the 29th the &s;hip was towed a-head, and at four in the afternoon was under &s;ail with a fine breeze. At five it fell calm, and at &s;even, there being no likelihood of advancing, came to, and anchored in 50 fathom water. At night &s;aw a fire at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="47">On the 30th weighed, and came to &s;ail about eleven o'clock; but the wind dying away, the boats continued towing till night came on, when they again ca&s;t anchor among the i&s;lands in 42 fathom water. The weather continuing fine, the &s;hip's company were plentifully &s;up|plied with fi&s;h, and were in high &s;pirits, hoping &s;oon to meet their a&s;&s;ociates in the Adventure at the appointed place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>May 1, they weighed anchor in expectation of taking advantage of a breeze of wind that &s;prung up about nine in the morning; but that proving contrary, they &s;tretched from &s;hore to &s;hore without making any con&s;ider|able way, and in the evening turned into a little cove and ca&s;t anchor. Here they catch|ed abundance of fi&s;h, and killed &s;ome water-fowl. The &s;hore was &s;o bold, that in turning into the cove the en&s;ign-&s;taff was entangled among the trees, and had it not been &s;tronger than the branches that encumbered it, the &s;hip's cour&s;e mu&s;t infallibly have been &s;topt. The boughs, however, gave way, and they ca&s;t anchor clo&s;e by the &s;hore.</P>
<P>May the 5th weighed and came to &s;ail, and with difficulty arrived at a convenient birth not above four little miles from the main ocean.</P>
<P>On the 6th at night they had a &s;trong gale, attended with thunder, lightning, and hail.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="48">On the 9th they hoi&s;ted inn the launch, and cleared the decks ready for &s;ea, while the pin|nace and &s;mall cutter were employed in fowl|ing and fi&s;hing for the &s;hip's u&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 11th they weighed anchor, and got clear of the bay, to which the Captain in his former voyage had given the name of Du&s;ky Bay, becau&s;e it being hazy when he pa&s;&s;ed it, he could di&s;cover nothing about it. The north point of this bay is rendered remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off, and give it the appearance of the four fingers and thumb of a man's hand. The harbour is con|&s;iderably within land, and lies in lat. 45 deg. 47 min. S. and in long. 193 deg. 17 min. W.</P>
<P>Of the inhabitants of this part of New Zea|land little can be &s;aid, as the family already de&s;cribed was the only one with which the &s;hips held any intercour&s;e. Other inhabitants there certainly were, but not in con&s;iderable numbers. The Captain in circumnavigating the northern and &s;outhern divi&s;ions of the i&s;land, had already remarked the different di&s;|po&s;itions of the inhabitants in the different parts of it. In &s;ome he found them fierce and bloody, ho&s;tile, and irreconcileable; in other places friendly, and ready to enter into traffic; at a di&s;tance from the&s;e the people they &s;aw &s;eemed indifferent and numerous, &s;carce think|ing it worth while to &s;u&s;pend their ordinary
<PB N="37" REF="49">
employments but for a moment to take notice of the uncommon &s;tructure of &s;o rare an ob|ject as an European &s;hip; and here, though the inhabitants mu&s;t know the place where the &s;trangers lay, &s;carce any of them for more than a month came to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>On the 17th, having met with nothing in their pa&s;&s;age worth relating, they came in &s;ight of the we&s;tern entrance of Charlotte Sound; but to their great a&s;toni&s;hment found them|&s;elves &s;urrounded with water-&s;pouts, &s;ome of them not more than three or four hundred yards from the &s;hip's cour&s;e, and having but little wind to clear them, were in the utmo&s;t terror, dreading their effects. It happened, however, providentially, that none of them broke till the &s;hip had reached the Sound, where &s;he ca&s;t anchor about &s;even at night within two miles di&s;tance of her con&s;ort, the Adventure, which in the morning &s;he found almo&s;t in readine&s;s to &s;ail. Nothing could equal the joy of their meeting, when they were mutually a&s;&s;ured that no di&s;a&s;ter had befallen either.</P>
<P>They had now ranged an unfrequented &s;ea, from the fir&s;t degree of ea&s;tern longitude (to which they had returned after directing their cour&s;e to the &s;outhward from the Cape of Good Hope) to the 167th degree of the &s;ame longitude, and having kept beyond the 45th degree of &s;outh latitude, and within the di&s;|tance
<PB N="38" REF="50">
of the 48th without once &s;eeing each other, or di&s;cerning the lea&s;t appearance of land, it may be affirmed with certainty, that no continent exi&s;ts within tho&s;e limits, and that all the conjectures and po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions of former navigators, and the rea&s;oning of geographers and a&s;tronomers concerning a Terra Incognita Au&s;tralis, have not the lea&s;t foundation in truth, but are mere fictions un|&s;upported by facts, and now fully di&s;proved by uncontrovertible demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>As the winter was now far advanced in that climate, it became nece&s;&s;ary to ha&s;ten their departure, in order to pur&s;ue their di&s;coveries as it was thought in the warmer climates. With this view both &s;hips &s;upplied them&s;elves with as much wild celery and other whole|&s;ome greens as the people employed in that &s;ervice could gather, and the &s;hips convenient|ly &s;tow. The brewers likewi&s;e on board the Re&s;olution made a &s;econd brewing of the malt they carried with them; but it does not appear that the Adventure was equally provided with malt.</P>
<P>On the 4th of June they celebrated his Maje&s;ty's birth-day with great rejoicings. The marines were drawn up on &s;hore, and fired in honour of the day; and the evening concluded with bonfires and fireworks, to the great a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the Indian beholders.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="51">On the 7th of June both &s;hips &s;et &s;ail; but in&s;tead of &s;teering an ea&s;terly and north ea&s;t|erly cour&s;e, as our journali&s;ts imagined they would do, from the advanced &s;tate of the &s;ea|&s;on, they continued their di&s;coveries to the &s;outh, &s;teering E. S. E. for &s;everal days, till they came into the old cour&s;e between the 47th and 48th degrees of &s;outh latitude; but here they found rhe weather &s;o rigorous and intolerably cold, that in lat. 47 deg. 26 min. S. long. 186 deg. 32 min. E. they changed their cour&s;e E. by N. which &s;oon brought them into a warmer climate. This was on the 16th of June, the very height of their winter.</P>
<P>On the 24th of June they found them&s;elves in lat. 43 deg. 58 min. S. and on the 27th in lat. 42 deg. 23 min. long. 196 deg. 30 min. E. in which direction they continued to &s;ail with little or no variation till the 15th of July, when the weather, which from the time of changing their cour&s;e to that day, had proved moderate, began to alter; &s;trong gales came on, and what was &s;till wor&s;e, the &s;curvy began to &s;hew it&s;elf on board the Adventure, and in a &s;hort time di&s;abled half her men. In all this long run they never had once &s;ight of land; &s;o that now they had ranged more than half the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere in various parallels, but all beyond any known tracks, and, except Van Deiman's Land, and New Zealand, both
<PB N="40" REF="52">
already &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed, they had &s;een nothing but &s;ky and &s;ea.</P>
<P>On July the 16th they again changed their cour&s;e E. N. E. till they came into a &s;till milder climate; and being happy in having moderate breezes and fair weather, on the 20th of July they found them&s;elves in lat. 31 deg. 34 min. and in long. 222 deg. 16 min. E.</P>
<P>On Augu&s;t the 1&s;t the &s;curvy had prevailed &s;o much on board the Adventure, that the men who remained in health were obliged to do double duty: and this was the more remark|able as there were but two men ill on board the Re&s;olution, one of a con&s;umption, the other of the rheumati&s;m. They were now in latitude 25 deg. 11 min. and 226 deg. 57 min. E. &s;ail|ing a we&s;terly cour&s;e for Otaheite.</P>
<P>The Adventure had lo&s;t her cook by death, and there being no man to be &s;pared on board that &s;hip, one William Chapman, an old &s;eaman on board the Re&s;olution, was appointed in his room.</P>
<P>On the 11th they di&s;covered three &s;mall low i&s;lands bearing W. S. W. di&s;tance about three leagues. They were now in lat. 17 deg. and long. 218 deg. 30 min. nearly.</P>
<P>Aug. 12, about five in the morning, the Re&s;olution made the &s;ignal for land, and was an&s;wered by the Adventure, when they &s;aw a &s;mall low i&s;land &s;urrounded by a chain of
<PB N="41" REF="53">
rocks, on which the Re&s;olution was near &s;trik|ing before &s;he di&s;covered her danger.</P>
<P>Every day now brought them in &s;ight of &s;mall i&s;lands, of which Tupia is &s;aid to have laid down a plan of more than 100 of his own knowledge, mo&s;t of them within the Tropics.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Augu&s;t they came in &s;ight of O&s;naburgh-i&s;land, &s;o named by the Dolphin, about a degree and a half to the ea&s;tward of Otaheite, and the &s;ame day came in &s;ight of Otaheite to their great joy.</P>
<P>On the 16th the weather being fair and calm, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the current carried them clo&s;e inn &s;hore upon a reef of rocks, on which the Re&s;olution &s;truck &s;everal times, but received no material da|mage. The Adventure came to with the coa&s;ting anchor, and hoi&s;ted out her boats, and got two &s;mall anchors and haw&s;ers to warp her off &s;hore; but in warping both haw&s;ers broke, and they lo&s;t both anchors; about &s;ix in the evening they &s;lipt their coa&s;ting cable, and came to &s;ea with the Re&s;olution. The Re&s;olution had likewi&s;e grounded, and had been obliged to cut her cable to get clear.</P>
<P>On the 17th both &s;hips anchored in a bay at the north-&s;ide of the i&s;land; a great number of the Indians &s;urrounded the &s;hips on their fir&s;t approaching the &s;hore, and when they were made to under&s;tand that they came from Bri|tain,
<PB N="42" REF="54">
they cried out for Toobia, Banks, and Solander, their old friends, neither of whom being on board, the Captains &s;hewed them|&s;elves to the populace, who &s;oon remembered them. They brought their boats loaded with fruits, but neither hogs nor fowls.</P>
<P>Tents were now erected and the &s;ick people from the Adventure carried on &s;hore, who re|covered fa&s;t.</P>
<P>And here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that our jour|nali&s;t of the Re&s;olution frequently mentions &s;moaking the &s;hip with brui&s;ed gunpowder and vinegar; bringing the hammocks from be|tween decks, and airing them when the weather was fine; and wa&s;hing and &s;craping the &s;hip; whereas no &s;uch important matters are taken notice of more than once by the journali&s;t of the Adventure, though it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch precautions could be omitted, were it not that the men on board the fir&s;t &s;hip &s;uffered nothing by the &s;curvy, while tho&s;e on board the other were almo&s;t all affected.</P>
<P>While the &s;hips continued in this &s;tation, which probably was cho&s;en as le&s;s exhau&s;ted of live-&s;tock than that where the Endeavour had lain &s;o long in her former voyage, the people were friendly, and &s;upplied the &s;hips plenti|fully with fruits; but hogs and poultry were hardly to be purcha&s;ed at any rate, nor indeed were any to be &s;een, except &s;uch as were
<PB N="43" REF="55">
brought in pre&s;ents for the Captains and gen|tlemen on board.</P>
<P>The crews of both &s;hips had paid the utmo&s;t obedience to their officers while at &s;ea, yet here it was hardly practicable with the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;ci|pline to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of the common men, or to keep them to their duty; it was not unu&s;ual for three or four of them one day with another to be puni&s;hed for going on &s;hore, and one day in particular no le&s;s than ten of them were puni&s;hed for the &s;ame offence; of whom &s;even were the Adventure's men, who were &s;carce recovered from their illne&s;s.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this i&s;land have already been &s;o fully de&s;cribed, that hardly any thing new can be added: One circum&s;tance indeed, &s;eems to have e&s;caped the notice of former voyagers, and that is their fidelity to tho&s;e who conde&s;cended to place confidence in them as particular friends. To &s;uch there is no &s;er|vice that they will not readily &s;ubmit, nor any good office that they will not willingly per|form; they will range the i&s;land through to procure them what they want, and when en|couraged by kindne&s;s and &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents and tokens of e&s;teem, no promi&s;es or rewards will influence them to break their attachments, or to di&s;&s;olve the connections &s;o formed, and generou&s;ly &s;upported; of this, our journali&s;ts had many proofs. This principle, however, is not to be under&s;tood to comprehend cha&s;tity
<PB N="44" REF="56">
among the women; for the&s;e, by their educa|tion, being bred to the practice of &s;en&s;ual de|lights, pride them&s;elves more in giving plea|&s;ure to many, than in being con&s;tant to one; their intercour&s;e with men generally begins before rea&s;on has any power in the government of the pa&s;&s;ions, and till they become mothers, their indulgence with men is held in no di&s;|grace. But there &s;eems to be in nature &s;ome|thing in&s;tinctive that &s;uper&s;edes the mo&s;t con|firmed habit, and inclines the mother to &s;eek an a&s;&s;i&s;tant for the protection and pre&s;ervation of her young: She therefore attaches her&s;elf to the father, and the father takes plea&s;ure in pro|tecting and providing for his offspring; hence it is, that there are very few in&s;tances of adul|tery among the natives of Otaheite; for where the commerce with the virgin is re&s;tricted by no law, there is no temptation to the gratifica|tion of the coar&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, with tho&s;e who are already, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, palled with their enjoyment. Thus it happens that a crime which is held in the utmo&s;t abhorrence in civilized countries, and which is productive of the mo&s;t complicated evils, is &s;o little known in this &s;avage country, as Europeans affect to call it, as &s;carce to have a name. Jealou&s;y, though a &s;elf-tormenting pa&s;&s;ion, and produc|tive of a whole train of malignant effects in European countries, is here too without a

&s;ting. In &s;hort, the &s;ubtile refinements which civilization has introduced among mankind, being utterly unknown among this happy people, their crimes are few, becau&s;e the pro|pen&s;ities of nature are univer&s;ally tolerated, and there being no contention about monied property, and the earth yielding &s;pontaneou&s;ly almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, nothing re|mains puni&s;hable among them that is not here puni&s;hable in a &s;tate of infancy, when every father is the legi&s;lature of his family.</P>
<P>Perhaps that propen&s;ity to theft, for which the inhabitants of all the i&s;les in the South-Seas, are &s;o lavi&s;hly &s;tigmatized by Europeans, may yet be found, upon examination, to be le&s;s criminal in them than it is generally e&s;|teemed. Is it not very natural, when a peo|ple &s;ee a company of &s;trangers come among them, and without ceremony cut down their trees, gather their fruits, &s;eize their animals, and, in &s;hort, take whatever they want, that &s;uch a people &s;hould u&s;e as little ceremony with the &s;trangers, as the &s;trangers do with them; if &s;o, again&s;t whom is the criminality to be charged, the chri&s;tian or the &s;avage? He that &s;ets the example, or he that follows it. Per|haps their propen&s;ity to thieving may be much le&s;s powerful among them&s;elves than the &s;ame propen&s;ity is among us, where though the puni&s;hment attending it is the &s;evere&s;t that
<PB N="46" REF="58">
can be inflicted, yet the effects of it are not to be re&s;trained even by the terrors of death. Why then upbraid the &s;avage with thievery? Is it becau&s;e in other re&s;pects he &s;hames the chri&s;tian by the innocence of his life? or that, having one crime in common with the chri&s;tian, all his other virtues are to be cancelled?</P>
<P>But even this crime, if in the circum&s;tances we have mentioned, it can be called a crime, was ea&s;ily re&s;trained. No &s;ooner were the condi|tions of traffic made known to them and per|fectly under&s;tood, than they on their part ho|ne&s;tly adhered to it. For a hatchet, they gave a hog, and for a nail a capon. Surely the &s;tranger had no rea&s;on to complain of extor|tion again&s;t the native, nor to give him an ill name for &s;upplying all that he wanted upon the ea&s;ie&s;t terms. It &s;hould &s;eem, from the rela|tions of our journali&s;ts, as well as from the re|ports of all former voyagers, that when the na|tives of the Southern i&s;lands were &s;atisfied that the Europeans came with no ho&s;tile intentions to invade their country, they were not only wil|ling to exchange with them what articles they &s;eemed mo&s;t to de&s;ire; but to load them with pre&s;ents of the be&s;t things which their coun|tries produced; of this the Briti&s;h voyagers re|ceived many proofs. When they met with op|po&s;ition, it was from the formidable appearance they made, and from the apprehen&s;ion the natives
<PB N="47" REF="59">
conceived of their mi&s;chievous de&s;igns; but tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions once removed, all preju|dices cea&s;ed of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t the &s;hips prepared to &s;hift their &s;tations; and on the 25th they ca&s;t anchor in Port Royal harbour, where the En|deavour had formerly been moored for more than three months. Here the chief articles of trade were hatchets, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, ra&s;ors, combs, looking-gla&s;&s;es, all &s;orts of nails and iron, white &s;tone beads, white &s;hirts, &amp;c. Grand necklaces, ear-rings, and artificial flowers, they paid little regard to.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the only animals our voyagers &s;aw upon this part of the i&s;land, (a few hogs and dogs excepted) were rats, and the&s;e &s;warmed the mo&s;t where the i&s;land was mo&s;t inhabited; nay, they &s;eemed to be che|ri&s;hed by the inhabitants, who often fed them with fruit, and, in&s;tead of de&s;troying them, kept them tame about their hou&s;es, like as we do cats.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the &s;hips moored in this har|bour, than all hands were &s;et to work in dif|ferent employments. The a&s;tronomers tent and apparatus were &s;et up on &s;hore, where the Captains of both &s;hips chiefly attended. Mr. Fo&s;ter went abroad every day in &s;earch of new productions; the armourers and carpenters were bu&s;ied in repairing, the coopers in clean|ing
<PB N="48" REF="60">
and new-hooping the ca&s;ks; the waterers in filling them, and the woodmen in felling wood: in &s;hort, every per&s;on was employed, and not a moment lo&s;t in fitting out the &s;hips for compleating their voyage.</P>
<P>It had been lamented in the cour&s;e of the former voyage, that the commerce of the wo|men with the European &s;trangers had entailed upon the natives the dreadful cur&s;e that on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America had depopulated half Spain;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the &s;ufferings of the fir&s;t victims by the venereal infection had been intolerably grievous; that it cau&s;ed the hair and the nails to fall off, and the fle&s;h to rot upon the bones; that it &s;pread an univer&s;al terror and con&s;ternation among them; &s;o that the &s;ick were abandoned by their near|e&s;t relations, le&s;t, like the lepro&s;y, the di&s;|ea&s;e &s;hould &s;pread by contagion, and they were &s;uffered to peri&s;h alone in &s;uch mi&s;ery as till then had never been known among them."</Q>
Yet it does not appear that any re|mains of it were di&s;coverable among them on the arrival of the pre&s;ent voyagers, though many of the &s;eamen felt the &s;mart of the in|fection before their departure. There is, there|fore, no rea&s;on to doubt but that the di&s;tem|per may be generated by the impurities which u&s;ually attend indi&s;criminate commerce with a variety of men. Whether the inhabitants have
<PB N="49" REF="61">
yet found out a cure, or whether the infected are &s;till &s;uffered to langui&s;h in their former ex|treme of mi&s;ery, till they are relieved by death, does not yet fully appear: but one may rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that had the latter been the ca&s;e, the women would have been more cau|tious, and the men more vigilant in with-hold|ing from the embraces of &s;trangers, tho&s;e who were to be the mothers of their future progeny. Be this as it may, the girls were as u&s;ual with|out re&s;traint; and the &s;ailors, as u&s;ual, were &s;ufferers by their freedom.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of September, the &s;hips being repaired, the water and wood &s;towed on board, the &s;ick recovered, and the tents &s;truck, about four in the afternoon they unmoored and came to &s;ail. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for thus &s;uddenly quitting their &s;tation was, becau&s;e no hogs were to be purcha&s;ed; but a better rea&s;on &s;eems to be the real one; and that was, that the &s;ailors in general were &s;o taken with the delights of the place, and &s;o &s;mitten with the charms of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that it was apprehended many would have &s;ecreted them&s;elves on &s;hore, and quitted the &s;hips, had they imagined that the time of their departure had been &s;o near; and of this they afterwards had a &s;triking proof, as &s;hall be related in its place.</P>
<P>Having a favourable gale, they continued to &s;teer to the N. W. all night.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="62">On the 2d of September they came in &s;ight of Huaheiny, one of the Society I&s;les, off which they ca&s;t anchor the &s;ame night. Early in the morning in working into Owhana Road the Adventure mi&s;&s;ed &s;tays, and backed a-&s;tern upon a reef of rocks on the larboard &s;ide in going in; but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Re&s;olu|tion's boats, added to their own, they got off with very little damage. They then warped into the bay, and moored &s;hip with the &s;mall bower and &s;tream anchors, and were &s;oon join|ed by the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>In this harbour &s;trict orders were i&s;&s;ued, that none of the men &s;hould trade for hogs or fowls. This precaution was taken to prevent the articles which they had on board to ex|change with the natives from &s;inking in their value, as they certainly would have done, if every one had been at liberty to give what he would, and to purcha&s;e what number he plea&s;ed. The Captain, therefore, very wi&s;ely, in order, be&s;ides, to avoid the confu&s;ion that &s;uch a market would nece&s;&s;arily produce, ap|pointed purveyors, by which both &s;hips were amply and plentifully &s;upplied, and at an ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>Here an accident happened that might have been productive of very &s;erious con&s;equences. One of the gentlemen belonging to the Adven|ture, by name Mr. Spearman, having made an
<PB N="51" REF="63">
excur&s;ion into the woods by him&s;elf, was &s;ud|denly &s;et upon by a party of Indians, who had ob&s;erved and track'd him, and who, having fir&s;t di&s;armed him, not only &s;tript and robbed him of his cloaths, and what things of value he had about him, but beat him becau&s;e he made re|&s;i&s;tance. This outrage, had it been &s;uffered to pa&s;s unre&s;ented, would certainly have been productive of other outrages of the &s;ame kind; and therefore it became nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue &s;ome means for redre&s;s. They were very un|willing, as no blood had yet been &s;pilt, to pro|ceed to extremities, and equally unwilling to &s;uffer the offenders to e&s;cape with their booty. They therefore contrived to get the King and Queen into their power; and when they were in the height of their entertainment on board, Mr. Spearman appeared in the mi|&s;erable condition in which he had been left by the robbers. The Captain, pointing to Mr. Spearman, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the royal gue&s;ts, gave them to under&s;tand, that the gentleman who &s;tood before them had been cruelly u&s;ed by a company of their people, and that he had lo&s;t both his cloaths and his arms; at the &s;ame time he in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;trict orders &s;hould immediately be i&s;&s;ued for ap|prehending the thieves, and for re&s;toring every thing they had taken away, even to the mi|nute&s;t article: he added, that they mu&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="64">
con&s;ent to be his ho&s;tages till ju&s;tice was done upon the offenders. This &s;pirited mea&s;ure produced the de&s;ired effect. The robbers were immediately pur&s;ued and taken. They had already parted their booty, and each brought back what had fallen to his &s;hare. The next &s;tep was to &s;ee them puni&s;hed; and, being brought on board, in order, as they thought, to be put to death, they were bound and &s;tript. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the terrors expre&s;&s;ed in the countenances of the&s;e poor &s;avages on this occa&s;ion; but ju&s;t as they apprehended the hand of the executioner was to be lifted up again&s;t them, they were relea&s;|ed, and pre&s;ented to Mr. Spearman, before whom they crouched with &s;uch different emo|tions of fear and joy as can only be conceived by tho&s;e who have been eye-witne&s;&s;es of their different ge&s;tures. Mr. Spearman rai&s;ed them up, and pre&s;ented them unhurt to their Maje&s;|ties, who received them with joy and grati|tude, loading the &s;hips with pre&s;ents after they were relea&s;ed; for they were little le&s;s terrified while in confinement than the criminals who had committed the offence.</P>
<P>After this adventure the &s;hips prepared to &s;ail, in order to vi&s;it Ulietea, an i&s;land within &s;ight, and much more con&s;iderable than Hua|heiny. Ju&s;t as they weer ready to depart an Indian came on board, and offered to enter a
<PB N="53" REF="65">
volunteer for Europe. It was debated whe|ther they &s;hould entertain him; but at la&s;t it was agreed to &s;uffer him to proceed, as they might, perhaps, have an opportunity of land|ing him at &s;ome other i&s;land within his know|ledge, &s;hould he afterwards expre&s;s a di&s;like to continue the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 7th of September about &s;even in the morning they unmoored, and about half after eight came to &s;ail in company together, direc|ting their cour&s;e we&s;tward with a gentle breeze and fair weather. When the &s;hip was under &s;ail, and the la&s;t canoe going off, the Indian called to his countrymen, cried much, and gave them &s;ome nails as pre&s;ents to his friends; but in a day or two he appeared gay, and quite happy.</P>
<P>On the 8th they arrived off Ulietea, and about noon anchored in a fine bay, where they were immediately &s;urrounded with canoes from all quarters, with hogs, fowls, fruits of various kinds, particularly bread-fruit, bananas, plan|tains, and cocoa nuts, with which the &s;hips were plentifully &s;upplied. As the&s;e fruits have all been repeatedly de&s;cribed by former voy|agers, it is not our de&s;ign to tire the reader with repetitions. Suffice it to &s;ay, that while their &s;tock of fruits la&s;ted, the men never ta&s;ted bi&s;cuit; nor while they could get fre&s;h provi|&s;ions did they ever eat &s;alt. It &s;eems, indeed, a very great mi&s;take, that the hogs purcha&s;ed
<PB N="54" REF="66">
here can neither be pre&s;erved for any continu|ance of time alive or dead, nor their fowls any more than their hogs kept alive longer than the fruits of the country on which they are accu&s;tomed to feed, can be pre&s;erved &s;ound; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e a greater number than could be con&s;umed in a certain time, would rather be an incumbrance than a benefit;&mdash;but the con|trary is the fact;&mdash;&s;o that at this i&s;land and that of Otaha adjoining, they purcha&s;ed a very con|&s;iderable &s;tock. Here likewi&s;e they filled their empty water-ca&s;ks, and having prepared every thing for a long voyage, on the 17th in the morning they &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of all the &s;ociety i&s;lands &s;eem to be nearly alike in manners, cu&s;toms, and di&s;po&s;itions; the women, in particular, are without mode&s;ty, and the men without courage; they have neither the manly boldne&s;s of the Ohoteroans, nor the &s;avage fiercene&s;s of the New-Zealanders; but are in general an effe|minate race, intoxicated with plea&s;ure, and en|feebled by indulgence.</P>
<P>They have among&s;t them many &s;ports and entertainments, in &s;ome more refined than in others, and our voyagers have remarked a di&s;|tinction in their features, &s;uch as is ob&s;ervable in Great-Britain between the Engli&s;h and the Welch, and between the Lowland Scotch and the Highlanders; in general they a&s;cribe to the Ulietean ladies a portion of beauty and deli|cacy
<PB N="55" REF="67">
&s;uperior to the other nations in the South|ern-Hemi&s;phere, and equal, if they may be credited, to the inhabitants of any nation upon earth. The journali&s;ts of the Re&s;olution, (&s;peak|ing by way of compari&s;on with the Otaheiteans,) &s;ay, the girls are here much fairer, and more loving.
The writer of Captain Cooke's former voyage, &s;ays <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the natural complexion of the Otaheiteans is that kind of clear olive or bru|nette, which many people in Europe prefer to the fine&s;t white and red; the &s;hape of the face is comely; their eyes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the women are full of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome|times &s;parkling with fire, and &s;ometimes melting with &s;oftne&s;s; their teeth mo&s;t beau|tifully even and white, and their breath per|fectly without taint."</Q>
The &s;ame writer re|lating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> manner of his voyagers reception on vi&s;iting a family at Ulietea, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the fir&s;t hou&s;e they entered, they found &s;ome very young women dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t neat|ne&s;s, who kept their &s;tation, expecting the &s;trangers to make them pre&s;ents, which they did with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, for prettier girls they had never &s;een; there was one of them about &s;ix years old, &s;tretched out her hand to receive the beads, which they offer|ed her, and no prince&s;s in Europe could have done it with a better grace."</Q>
This may &s;uf|fice to give a general idea of the inhabitants

of the&s;e delightful i&s;lands, which it is more than probable are the &s;ame which Quiros, the Spani&s;h voyager, dignified with the name of the i&s;les of Soloman. They lie between the la|titudes of 16 deg. 10 min. and 16 deg. 55 min. S. and between the longitude 150 deg. 57 min. and 152 deg. we&s;t of London; or, as our voy|agers compute, between the long. of 208 and 209 deg. E.</P>
<P>On the 18th both &s;hips &s;et &s;ail in company; they had on board 160 hogs, and a large quan|tity of bread, and fruit, and they had plea&s;ant weather, and a favourable gale; their cour&s;e W. S. W.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till the 23d, when in lat. 19 deg. 6 min. S. and long. 201 deg. 53 min. E. they came in &s;ight of a low &s;mall i&s;land bearing S. W. by S. Cour&s;e W. S. W. wind S. E.

they came in &s;ight of Middleburgh, a plea&s;ant i&s;land di&s;covered by Ta&s;man, in 1643, bearing from them about W. by N.

The i&s;le at eight o'clock bore W. by S. half S Lay off and on all night.</P>
<P>Oct. 2, about five in the morning bore away under top&s;ails. At &s;ix &s;et fore&s;ails, and &s;teered W. and W. by N. between the large i&s;le and a &s;mall one lying about three leagues to the &s;outhward. When they had &s;tretched two or three leagues to the ea&s;tward of this i&s;land, they could perceive land bearing about W. by N. di&s;tance about &s;ix or &s;even leagues. At eight in the morning got clo&s;e under the land, and anchored in 45 fathom water. In le&s;s than half an hour they were &s;urrounded with In|dians, &s;ome in canoes, and &s;ome &s;wimming, but none came along&s;ide the &s;hips, &s;ave one, who brought in his hand the piece of a root which they make much u&s;e as a token of peace, and pre&s;ented it to the Captain, who received it re&s;pectfully, and in return made the Indian a &s;mall pre&s;ent. This he al&s;o received, and placing it upon the top of his head, &s;at down on the quarter-deck, and held it there for the &s;pace of half a minute. He &s;eemed very de|&s;irous of making him&s;elf under&s;tood, and want|ed
<PB N="58" REF="70">
much to enter into conver&s;ation with the In|dian they had on board, but their languages were totally different.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that Tupia, being a man of learning and of a &s;uperior cla&s;s to the common rank of people in his nation, and one too who had &s;ailed among the i&s;les, mu&s;t have under|&s;tood more languages than one, or it is not ea&s;y to conceive how he could have interpreted, as he is &s;aid to have done, the language of the New-Zealanders to Mr. Banks and the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates, more e&s;pecially as New-Zealand lies at treble the di&s;tance from Otaheite that the&s;e i&s;lands do which we are now de&s;cribing. The inhabitants of Middleburgh are large and well proportioned. Our journali&s;t of the Re&s;olu|tion remarks, that both men and women want|ed one of their little fingers; and Ta&s;man who fir&s;t di&s;covered that i&s;land makes a &s;imilar re|mark. They al&s;o agree in their de&s;cription of the manner of painting their bodies from the wai&s;t downwards, but they differ as to their hair, which our journali&s;t &s;ays is black and friz|zled; Ta&s;man, that &s;ome wear it cropt and others long. Our journali&s;ts repre&s;ent the men as bold and re&s;olute; armed with clubs of eight or ten pounds weight, and bows and arrows, and of a fierce and dauntle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition: Ta&s;|man, on the contrary, &s;ays, they were wholly without arms, friendly and peaceable; they
<PB N="59" REF="71">
agree in their de&s;cription of the country, and of the plenty that abounds in it. Our journa|li&s;ts &s;ay that no country in the world has a more beautiful appearance, and Ta&s;man that it is neatly laid out, and cultivated, and that it is delightfully inter&s;per&s;ed with walks and fruit trees. The natives readily exchanged their fruits for nails and pieces of cloth, and other articles of &s;mall value; but upon enquiry there being no water to be procured, the Captain &s;hortened his &s;tay, and next day</P>
<P>October 3, weighed anchor and put to &s;ea, directing his cour&s;e S. W. to an i&s;land about five leagues di&s;tant, to which Ta&s;man gave the name of Am&s;terdam. Here both &s;hips ca&s;t anchor and moored.</P>
<P>During their &s;tay great numbers of the na|tives came off daily with hogs, fowls, and fruits of different &s;orts, which our voyagers purcha&s;ed for trifles.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is level, the lawns of a beautiful green, and the woods abounding with fruit-bearing trees, &s;o varied in colour that nothing in nature can afford a more enchanting pro&s;|pect. Here the &s;hore is open, not &s;urrounded with reefs of rocks as the Society I&s;les are, but free and bold, from 25 to 35 fathom water, and of a &s;helly bottom.</P>
<P>Here the Captains were vi&s;ited by the chief men of the i&s;land; but when they went to re|turn
<PB N="60" REF="72">
the compliment on &s;hore, taking a guard of &s;oldiers with them for the greater &s;tate, a quarrel en&s;ued, which was not ended without blood &s;hed. The natives, like almo&s;t all the other i&s;landers in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, are great thieves, and taking a fancy to the hats on the mens heads, it was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to pre|vent their &s;natching them away. This, how|ever, the &s;oldiers endeavoured to do by pre|&s;enting their bayonets, but that had no effect; the Indians attempted to wre&s;t the arms from the &s;oldiers by force; but failing in their fir&s;t attempt, the fray became general, and the &s;ol|diers were in danger of being overpowered by numbers. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary for the officers to interpo&s;e, who, finding no other means of pre&s;erving good order, and com|manding re&s;pect, gave the word for one file to fire over the heads of the croud, and the other file to re&s;erve their fire till it &s;hould be &s;een what effect the fal&s;e fire would have in intimi|dating the a&s;&s;ailants. At fir&s;t the Indians &s;eemed to de&s;i&s;t, but &s;eeing no mi&s;chief had en&s;ued from &s;uch an uncommon report, they redoubled their attack, and were for pre&s;&s;ing on more vigorou&s;ly, when orders were given to fire in good earne&s;t, by which two of the mo&s;t forward among them were &s;hot dead, and &s;ome others de&s;perately wounded. This at once put an end to the di&s;pute. The In|dians
<PB N="61" REF="73">
fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and &s;ome pieces were fired after them, not to hurt any of them, but to &s;hew them that they were not out of the reach of European arms when at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. This prevented every kind of in&s;ult for the future. The peo|ple came afterwards and traded fairly. They brought hogs in great abundance, which the common men killed and &s;alted, and fowls of an enormous &s;ize. They al&s;o brought bread-fruit, cocoa nuts by thou&s;ands, plantains, and a fruit our journali&s;ts called &s;haddocks, as large as cocoa nuts, and of the colour and &s;mell of lemons, all which they exchanged for trifles.</P>
<P>Being in &s;earch of water, our voyagers had an opportunity of &s;eeing and examining the hou&s;es and plantations of the inhabitants of the inland parts of the country, and found them infinitely preferable to any in that part of the world they had yet beheld. Their hou&s;es are far more commodious than tho&s;e of the i&s;landers near the line: they were open in|deed on one &s;ide like theirs, and at one end, but all the re&s;t were clo&s;e covered. They were divided into apartments, which &s;eemed to be proportioned to the number of the fa|mily that inhabited them; in &s;ome there were more, in others fewer. In the villages, the lanes between the hou&s;es were not wider than ten or twelve feet. Behind every hou&s;e a piece
<PB N="62" REF="74">
of ground was allotted at lea&s;t a hundred feet long: the&s;e little &s;pots were planted with cocoa-nut trees on the out&s;ide, and with plan|tains, yams, &s;weet potatoes, and other vege|tables within. Each plantation was divided from the next adjoining plantation by bamboo partitions from twelve to &s;ixteen feet high. Adjoining to the&s;e were lawns or fields, the gra&s;s on which grows to the height of eighteen inches, and never lo&s;es its verdure. With this gra&s;s they cover the floors of their hou&s;es to a con&s;iderable height, and over it they place mats very curiou&s;ly woven, on which they re|po&s;e them&s;elves in the day, and &s;leep in the night. They always eat in the open air, and generally the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e eats alone; the wife and children eat together. They wear no cloaths from the middle upwards, neither men nor women; but they have a very curious kind of cloth which they tie about their wai&s;ts with a platted girdle, and which hangs in folds nearly as low as their knees, and this is all the cloathing in u&s;e from the planter to the king. The women are tall, well-&s;haped, and &s;trongly made, and &s;eem to employ them|&s;elves in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family. The arti|ficers they did not &s;ee, but many there mu&s;t be, as both the i&s;lands Middleburgh and Am|&s;terdam are amazingly populous; and they have many very ingenious implements among
<PB N="63" REF="75">
them that &s;eem to require much &s;kill and nicety in the con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Our voyagers made &s;igns that they wanted water, and the people with great &s;implicity and good nature brought them cocoa-nuts, and &s;hewed them how to drink the milk. It &s;hould &s;eem that they knew no other beverage but the milk of the cocoa-nut.</P>
<P>The voyagers again made &s;igns that they wanted water to fill their ca&s;ks to bear away on board; they &s;hook their heads, and gave them to under&s;tand that they knew of none nearer than two days journey up the country. It was in vain, therefore, to continue their pur&s;uit; they, like Ta&s;man's people, dug wells, but the water they came at was not drinkable. Thus di&s;appointed, (if a di&s;appointment it may be called) when they could not but know (the officers at lea&s;t) that Ta&s;man had &s;earched the i&s;land before, and had apprized future naviga|tors that they might &s;pare them&s;elves the trou|ble of &s;eeking for water, for on the&s;e i&s;lands none was to be had, the party &s;ent out on this &s;ervice returned on board.</P>
<P>On the&s;e i&s;lands the virtue of cha&s;tity has not yet taken place. The women, though le&s;s inviting, are not le&s;s willing to gratify &s;trangers with all they can de&s;ire. But it &s;hould &s;eem from their remarkable populou&s;ne&s;s, that their dome&s;tic concerns are under better regulations
<PB N="64" REF="76">
among them&s;elves than has yet been ob&s;erved among the i&s;landers, whom our voyagers had lately left.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a &s;tronger indication of fe|male con&s;tancy than a numerous offspring; and as the&s;e people, it is probable, have never but once before been vi&s;ited by European in|truders; their per&s;ons may be pure, and their morals uncorrupted, &s;o far at lea&s;t as re&s;pects their neare&s;t connections.</P>
<P>As to the complexion of the&s;e i&s;landers, it is &s;warthy inclining to a &s;ooty black, their fea|tures are not di&s;agreeable, rather &s;mall than ma&s;culine, their teeth white and even, their eyes &s;mall, and their no&s;es rather flat than pro|minent; but in that, as among us, they differ con&s;iderably; the make of their faces is in ge|neral round, and their ears large and long; the beards of &s;ome appear to be &s;horn, which &s;eems a mark of di&s;tinction among the chiefs, probably, the &s;ymbol of prie&s;thood; but of that our journali&s;ts do not pretend to deter|mine.</P>
<P>The articles of traffic on which they &s;eemed to &s;et the greate&s;t value, were pieces of linen cloth, white paper, &s;carlet &s;hreds, and painted cottons. Nails, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knives, beads, and iron in all forms, bore a good price; for the&s;e they would part with whatever their country produced, natural or artificial; &s;ome of their
<PB N="65" REF="77">
cloth &s;eemed to be made, like the cloth of Otaheite, of the bark of a tree, and had the appearance of paper; another kind, made of India-gra&s;s, was very &s;trong, and looked like fine matting; but their ba&s;kets were mo&s;t ad|mired by our journali&s;ts, who think they can|not be equalled in the univer&s;e; they are made in a thou&s;and different &s;hapes, and all &s;o clo&s;e and compact, as to hold water as tight as a ca&s;k. Their working tools, their proas or ca|noes, which differ from all others in being deck'd at both ends with flat boards; their nets for catching fi&s;h, their fi&s;h-hooks, and their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, their arms, and in &s;hort all their mechanical inventions are each &s;o curiou&s;|ly made and poli&s;hed, that it would require the utmo&s;t &s;kill of an European artificer to excell them.</P>
<P>As the&s;e i&s;lands have never before been vi|&s;ited by any European ve&s;&s;el &s;ince their fir&s;t di&s;covery by Ta&s;man, one hundred and thirty three years ago, and as Ta&s;man's account of them is curious and in few hands, the reader, it is pre&s;umed, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with a tran&s;cript of it from Mr. Dalrymple's Hi&s;torical Collection of Dutch Voyages to the South Pa|cific ocean, where alone it is pre&s;erved with the greate&s;t accuracy: <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e two i&s;lands, &s;ays the writer, bear N. E. and S. W. from one another, that to the &s;outhward was the

highe&s;t, the northernmo&s;t being flatte&s;t almo&s;t like Holland. At noon a prauw came along &s;ide, with three tawney men of a &s;tature &s;omething above the common; one with his hair cropt, the other two wearing it long; they had only a &s;mall covering round their wai&s;ts; their prauw was narrow, but with a deck fore and aft, and their paddles of the common length, but the blades with which they paddled were broad in the middle.<P>"Having &s;hewn a piece of linen to them, we to&s;&s;ed it overboard, at which one of them di|ved and remained a long time under water, but brought it up, and when he was got into the prauw, waved it &s;everal times over his head by way of rejoicing.</P>
<P>"Afterwards, on their prauw's coming nearer to us, we threw them a bit of wood, with two large nails tied to it, and-handed to them a &s;mall chine&s;e looking-gla&s;s, together with a chain of chine&s;e beads, which they took hold of by means of a long pole, and in return tied to it &s;ome of their fi&s;hing-hooks, which were made of a kind of mother of pearl.</P>
<P>"Some of them laid the beads, the looking gla&s;s, and the chain upon their heads, and he in the middle tied the nails about his neck.</P>
<P>"We handed another looking-gla&s;s to the i&s;landers, in which they could &s;ee them&s;elves, the fir&s;t being covered with a thin &s;ort of board
<PB N="67" REF="79">
which could be drawn out; this they likewi&s;e very joyfully laid on their heads.</P>
<P>"We al&s;o &s;hewed to them a cocoa-nut, and a fowl, and from the vocabulary of Schouten a&s;ked the Indians about water, hogs, &amp;c. but neither under&s;tood one another; however they pointed towards the &s;hore, as if they would go and bring &s;omething, and accordingly paddled away.</P>
<P>"In the afternoon our people &s;aw a con&s;ider|able number of men running along &s;hore with little white flags, which ours took for en&s;igns of peace, and an&s;wered them by hoi&s;ting a white en&s;ign; on which came on board in a prauw four &s;tout fellows, with their bodies painted black from the navel to the thighs, and their necks decorated with leaves hanging down from it; they brought with them a &s;ort of garment made of rind of trees, and likewi&s;e a &s;mall white flag, which they placed in the prow of our boat. One of the prauw's wings being embelli&s;hed with variety of &s;hells and other marine productions, our people conceiv|ed it to belong to the king, or chief of the country, and pre&s;ented him with a Chine&s;e looking-gla&s;s, a knife, a bit of callico, and &s;ome nails.</P>
<P>"Our people, the better to plea&s;e them, drank a gla&s;s of wine to them, then gave them
<PB N="68" REF="80">
a rummer-full, which they emptied, and car|ried the rummer away with them.</P>
<P>"Soon after came a number of prauws, &s;ome of which brought ten or twelve cocoa nuts, for which our people bartered nails; &s;ome even &s;wam off to the &s;hips with cocoa nuts.</P>
<P>"Afterwards came an aged man on board, who, amid&s;t all the reverence paid him by the others, &s;aluted our people, bowing down his head to his very feet; and we were not wanting to return the compliment, making him be&s;ides a pre&s;ent of &s;everal trinkets.</P>
<P>"Some, however, at going away betrayed a thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, and towards evening not le&s;s than twenty prauws came about Ta&s;man's &s;hip, making a great outcry of <HI>Whor, whor, whor,</HI> and brought on board a hog with &s;ome cocoa nuts and yams, for which we gave them a wooden di&s;h and &s;ome copper wire, and af|terwards exchanged beads and nails for &s;ome cocoa nuts, plantains, and yams.</P>
<P>"On its growing dark they all went away, except one who &s;taid on board all night.</P>
<P>"On the 22d of January, &s;everal men and women, young and old, came on board with all kinds of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>"The olde&s;t of the women wanted the little finger of both hands, which was not the ca&s;e of the younger, and our people could not come at the cau&s;e of this mutilation.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="81">"On the &s;ame day came again on board the before-mentioned old man with &s;ome pre&s;ents, which we returned with a &s;attin gown, a &s;hirt, and a hat. At noon we had along&s;ide thirty-two &s;mall prauws, and a large one with a &s;ail and &s;everal men and women, who brought refre&s;hments and &s;ome unknown vegetables, likewi&s;e a garment made of rind.</P>
<P>"To the chief of eighteen robu&s;t men and their wives, Ta&s;man made a pre&s;ent of a pair of breeches and a &s;hirt, with which, on put|ting them on, he fancied him&s;elf wonderfully fine.</P>
<P>"Among the&s;e was a very large man having a St. Thomas's arm, and a woman with &s;ome|thing of a natural beard.</P>
<P>"Our trumpeter and fidler played &s;everal tunes, at which they expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urpri&s;e. The old man having by &s;igns given them to under&s;tand, that they might have water for fetching, thereupon Ta&s;man, &s;ent his boats for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"In each long-boat went a mate, and with them &s;kipper Ide Tjerkzoon Holman, and merchant Gil&s;eman in the barge. All our people were likewi&s;e well armed, though by the friendline&s;s of the natives this precaution &s;eemed unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"After rowing a pretty way, our people came to the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, where at
<PB N="70" REF="82">
length they met with three little pools, out of which they were obliged to take up the water with a cocoa-nut &s;hell; but what was &s;till wor&s;e, it proved not worth taking up.</P>
<P>"On this the i&s;landers conducted our people farther up the country, and indeed to a mo&s;t plea&s;ant place, where they &s;eated them under a very &s;ightly <HI>belay</HI> on mats of a very delicate texture, and variety of beautiful colours, treat|ing them with two cooca nuts, one for the chief, and one for our &s;kipper.</P>
<P>"In the evening our people returned on board with a hog, and an account that no water was to be had; they however made &s;o good a day's work of it as to get forty pigs, &s;eventy fowls, and vegetables in abundance, for a few nails, a little &s;ail-cloth, and other trifles.</P>
<P>"Smoaking tobacco is not known here. The women from the wai&s;t to the knees wear a covering of matted leaves, but all the other parts of the body are naked, and their hair &s;horter than that of the men: the latter have a beard three or four fingers broad, with whi&s;kers kept carefully under a quarter of an inch in length. There being likewi&s;e no ap|pearance of weapons among the&s;e people, ours were the le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of any di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>"The day following, going a&s;hore to dig for water, we met with much better entertain|ment,
<PB N="71" REF="83">
excellent fi&s;h, milk, and fruits, and in every re&s;pect their whole behaviour was very courteous and friendly.</P>
<P>"Our people farther bartered with the i&s;landers for a con&s;iderable quantity of pigs and fowls; but in the afternoon, the ground being loo&s;e, the trade-wind drove the &s;hips out to &s;ea, but at night got &s;afe again into conveni|ent anchorage."</P></Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they anchored here they al&s;o di&s;cover|ed two high but very &s;mall i&s;lands, not above a mile or a mile and a half in circumference, about &s;even or eight miles to the north-we&s;t. Al&s;o a whole clu&s;ter of little i&s;lands in almo&s;t every direction, and among others one about a degree to the &s;outhward, where they found plenty of fine water, and every other nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;hip's u&s;e. This i&s;land they named Rot|terdam; at which our voyagers &s;eem not to have touched.</P>
<P>On the 7th of October our voyagers un|moored, and in &s;o doing the Re&s;olution lo&s;t her &s;tream anchor.</P>
<P>On the 8th they came in &s;ight of the i&s;land of Pyll&s;taert, di&s;covered likewi&s;e by Ta&s;man, bear|ing to S. W. di&s;tance about nine or ten leagues, cour&s;e S. S. W. and S. by W. &s;teering for New-Zealand; at &s;ix &s;hortened &s;ail and killed two large &s;harks.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="84">Nothing remarkable till the 15th, when in lat. 30 deg. 15 min. they &s;aw &s;ome egg-birds, and &s;ea-birds, certain &s;igns of land near, which proved to be New Zealand.</P>
<P>On the 16th killed three albatro&s;&s;es and &s;ome egg-birds. At &s;even in the evening &s;hortened &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 17th continued to &s;ee &s;ea-weeds; and &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall birds that never fly far from land, probably &s;ome i&s;land lying off the northermo&s;t point of New Zealand.</P>
<P>On the 18th, cour&s;e S. S. E. fine plea&s;ant weather, &s;aw &s;ome white birds, &s;ea-weed, and albatro&s;&s;es. Lat. 33 deg. 47 min.</P>
<P>On the 19th the Re&s;olution had outrun the Adventure con&s;iderably. The weather, which had hitherto been clear and mild, now began to alter. The bread-fruit on board being all expended, the &s;teward began &s;erving out bi&s;|cuit as u&s;ual to the &s;hip's company. Latitude 35 deg. 59 min.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t came in &s;ight of New Zealand. The Adventure being a great way a-&s;tern, &s;hortened &s;ail, and the Re&s;olution joined com|pany. At &s;ix pa&s;&s;ed Portland I&s;land, and &s;aw &s;e|veral people on the top of it. About ten the wind &s;hifted to N. W.&mdash;Cour&s;e W. S. W. At eleven the wind &s;hifted to the N.&mdash;Cour&s;e W. At twelve, cour&s;e W. S. W. ran along &s;hore all night.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="85">On the 22d at five in the morning made &s;ail, wind at N. W. cour&s;e S. S. W. At &s;ix &s;teer|ed S. by W. all &s;ails &s;et. At ten about eleven leagues to the northward of Charlotte Sound, there came off three canoes, one of which was curiou&s;ly carved from head to &s;tern. The figure that formed the head had &s;ome re&s;em|blance of a griffin. On board of this canoe was a chief with a weapon in his hand like a &s;erjeant's halbert, who, after &s;ome ceremonies had pa&s;&s;ed, came on board, and was &s;aluted by the Captain of the Re&s;olution, and the other gentlemen. The head of this Chief was curiou&s;ly tatowed, and his hair was finely or|mented with feathers; it was tied, as their cu&s;|tom is, in a knot on the top of his head; and the feathers of various colours were plaited all round in a very neat and elegant manner. Their chief pride &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in ornament|ing their hair. After admiring the wonderful &s;tructure of the &s;hip, being &s;hewn the cabin, the hold, the gun-room, and the other con|veniences between decks, he next took a &s;ur|vey of the rigging, the ma&s;ts, &s;ails, and ropes, and the dexterous manner of handling them. On being &s;hewn &s;o many novelties, he could not help expre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment by a va|riety of ge&s;tures. At length, being de&s;irous of departing, the Captain pre&s;ented him with &s;ome cocks and hens, and gave him al&s;o a
<PB N="74" REF="86">
boar and a &s;ow, and made him under&s;tand, that if he pre&s;erved them alive, they would run into the woods, and would want no at|tendance, but would breed, and become nu|merous, and go in companies.</P>
<P>About twelve he took his leave, and by way of expre&s;&s;ing the plea&s;ure he had received, began a war &s;ong, in which he was joined by his attendants, who performed all the motions and ge&s;tures by which the&s;e people challenge their enemies to fight, an account of which has already been given by Parkin&s;on and others. The weather was now dry, the &s;ea calm, and the wind at W. S. W.&mdash;Cour&s;e to &s;outh. At three in the afternoon, the Re&s;olu|tion being three leagues from land, the gale fre&s;hened, and &s;uddenly &s;hifted to the we&s;t; the &s;ails being &s;et, it pre&s;ently carried away the foretop-gallant-ma&s;t, and &s;plit the mizzen-top|&s;ail. All hands were called up, and employed in reefing the top-&s;ails, taking down the miz|zen, and getting another up. Lay off and on all night; but in the morning had parted from the Adventure, and never joined again till their arrival in England.</P>
<P>On the 23d wore &s;hip, and &s;tood in for land. Clo&s;e reefed fore and main-top&s;ails, and hand|ed them. Blow'd a hurricane, attended with prodigious heavy &s;howers; but about nine the wind blew moderate, and the rains cea&s;ed.

<P>On the 3d at five in the morning they weighed, and came to &s;ail; and about eleven moored &s;hip in a convenient birth to wood and water. They had hardly dropt anchor before &s;everal canoes came with fi&s;h to &s;ell, which the crew purcha&s;ed, as u&s;ual, at very ea&s;y rates.</P>
<P>On the 4th all hands were employed in get|ting the tents on &s;hore, for the u&s;e of the dif|ferent artificers who were to be employed in repairing the damage the &s;hip had received in
<PB N="80" REF="92">
&s;uch a perilous navigation. It can &s;carce be credited by any but a &s;ailor, that a &s;hip could be to&s;&s;ed to and fro for twelve or fourteen days together in getting into a &s;trait not le&s;s in width than the channel that divides Eng|land from France; and that, notwith&s;tanding they were almo&s;t every day in &s;ight of it, they &s;hould be unable to reach it with the utmo&s;t exertion of their &s;kill in &s;eaman&s;hip. Yet &s;o it was with the Re&s;olution; and much wor&s;e with the Adventure, as will &s;oon be made ap|pear.</P>
<P>[But here, if a bye-&s;tander may be permitted to make a remark, it &s;eems not very ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for Capt. Cooke's return to New-Zealand, after having already vi&s;ited that country, and after having, in the height of winter, that is, about the middle of June, run as far as the 48th degree of &s;outhern lati|tude, and after continuing in that cour&s;e, with &s;ome variation to the northward, till the 29th of June, at which time we find him in the 43d degree of &s;outhern latitude, and in the 197th degree of ea&s;tern longitude, more than 23 degrees to the ea&s;tward of Cape Palli&s;er; in which latitude of 43, with &s;till a little varia|tion to the northward, he &s;eems to have con|tinued his cour&s;e till the 15th of July, when we find him in the latitude of 42 degrees, and in the longitude of 223 deg. 23 min. E.
<PB N="81" REF="93">
no le&s;s than 47 degrees to the ea&s;tward of Cape Palli&s;er; &s;o that having now &s;ailed in an unfrequented &s;ea farther by many degrees to the &s;outhward than any navigator had ever before attempted, and even beyond where any of them &s;uppo&s;ed the northern coa&s;t of a con|tinent to lie, there did not &s;eem any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for him to retrace what he him&s;elf had already examined; nor indeed to retrace the cour&s;e which Ta&s;man had pointed out from New-Zealand to the tropical i&s;lands which he di&s;covered, one of which was mo&s;t unque&s;tionably the i&s;land which Commodore Byron di&s;covered, and called by the name of King George's I&s;land, unle&s;s his rout was &s;et|tled at home before he &s;et out, and he was confined to that rout. And indeed, what &s;eems to render the motives of this navigation &s;till more ob&s;cure, is, that Capt. Cooke does not &s;eem to have made any efforts towards any new di&s;covery in his track from Otaheite to New-Zealand, but to have contented him|&s;elf with vi&s;iting the i&s;lands of Middleburg and Am&s;terdam, as they lay in a manner full in his way, and as they helped to recruit his &s;tock of fre&s;h provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>If the opinion of Dr. Campbell, the editor of the la&s;t edition of Harris's Collection of Voyages, may be allowed any weight in this que&s;tion, the i&s;lands of Rotterdam, Middle|burg,
<PB N="82" REF="94">
and Am&s;terdam, of which i&s;lands a de&s;|cription has ju&s;t been given, are the mo&s;t hap|pily &s;ituated of any in the world, for making new di&s;coveries, particularly the former, which is &s;aid to be a perfect paradi&s;e, abounding in every thing that voyagers can po&s;&s;ibly want, and having plenty of fre&s;h water, which article alone can be had at New-Zealand, wood and wild cellery excepted; the &s;upplying of which is the only o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for the return of the &s;hips to New-Zealand.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould &s;eem that navigating tho&s;e un|frequented &s;eas farther than any navigator had ever before attempted, would by no means content Captain Cooke; who, in order to pre|clude all future conjectures concerning an ima|ginary continent, has carried his di&s;coveries to the utmo&s;t verge of &s;outhern latitude, beyond which, it may be pre&s;umed, no &s;ucceeding navigator will ever attempt to extend his en|quires. At his fir&s;t &s;etting out from the Cape of Good Hope, he ran as far to the &s;outhward as was practicable, as we have already related. We have traced him returning to a practicable parallel of latitude, namely, between the 48th and 50th degrees S. and in tho&s;e parallels have accompanied him 175 degrees ea&s;tward. We &s;hall hereafter ob&s;erve him, after having run 180 degrees of longitude, or half the extent of the Southern Hemi&s;phere, &s;till running farther
<PB N="83" REF="95">
to the South than he had reached in his fir&s;t run from the Cape; and we &s;hall endeavour to point out the &s;equel of his track with as much exactne&s;s as we have traced the beginning.</P>
<P>That New-Zealand is one of the mo&s;t pro|per &s;tations that can be cho&s;en from whence to proceed on di&s;coveries to the &s;outhward, not|with&s;tanding what we have before ob&s;erved from Campbell, is not to be denied; for beginning the longitude from the meridian of London, and pur&s;uing it in a parallel between 47 and 48 degrees of &s;outhern latitude, in an ea&s;terly di|rection, when half the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere is nearly pa&s;&s;ed, the navigator will find him&s;elf within &s;ight of the South Cape of New-Zealand; but as that would be an improper climate to winter in, what has he to do but to bear down to Charlotte Sound, a &s;afe harbour, in a middle climate, where he is neither in fear of being an|noyed by the inten&s;e heats of the &s;ummer, nor frozen up by the rigorous cold of the winter; and where in the winter he may prepare him|&s;elf by refitting his &s;hip, and getting provi&s;ions from the warmer climates, for pur&s;uing his di&s;|coveries in the other half of the Southern He|mi&s;phere early in the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>That this was, in part, the plan which Cap|tain Cooke had in view, appears from his pro|gre&s;s, but &s;till the main objection recurs, why, (when di&s;covery was his only object) &s;ail &s;o
<PB N="84" REF="96">
many hundred leagues in a known track as from Otaheite to New-Zealand, without de|viating either to the right hand or to the left in &s;earch of what he was &s;ent abroad to find? It may, indeed, be urged, that the &s;pring was already &s;o far gone before he left the Society i&s;les, that there was but barely time enough remaining to reach the de&s;tined port, before the proper &s;ea&s;on for beginning his &s;outhernly di&s;|coveries commenced. This indeed appears to be true, but why go to the Society I&s;les at all? They were already &s;ufficiently known, and there was an immen&s;e tract of unfrequented ocean to the north-we&s;tward of New-Zealand to examine, where no &s;hip has ever yet &s;ailed; and where no doubt there are many i&s;lands equally large, equally fruitful, and where the inhabitants are equally ho&s;pitable with tho&s;e of Otaheite. In this pur&s;uit, &s;uppo&s;ing the wor&s;t, that no &s;uch i&s;land had been found, the &s;hips, in that ca&s;e, might have directed their cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Rotterdam, where Ta&s;man found every thing &s;o abundant, and the inhabitants &s;o ready to &s;upply his wants, that the fear of a di&s;ap|pointment could have no weight; his motive, therefore, for pur&s;uing his di&s;coveries in the winter of 1773, to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, ea&s;t|ward, north-ea&s;tward, and afterwards to the we&s;tward to arrive at Otaheite, among the well known i&s;lands there, rather than to range
<PB N="85" REF="97">
the happier climates to the north-we&s;tward, we&s;tward, northward and north ea&s;tward of New-Zealand, remains to be accounted for; for we confe&s;s we can &s;ee no rea&s;on for his pur|&s;uing an ea&s;terly cour&s;e for more than 45 de|grees beyond the parallel of 41 degrees, in 1733, and afterwards pur&s;uing the &s;ame ea&s;ter|ly cour&s;e for more than 90 degrees in the &s;um|mer of 1774, beyond the parallel of 50 de|grees; nay for the greate&s;t part of the way be|yond the parallels of 60, and 64, and &s;ome part even beyond the 70th degree.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that both &s;hips experienced on reco|vering Charlotte-Sound on the coa&s;t of New-Zealand gave occa&s;ion to, we &s;hall leave the Re&s;olution &s;afely anchored in Charlotte-Sound, and take up the Adventure where the two &s;hips parted company.</P>
<P>On the 22d of October being in lat. 40 deg. 15 min. and in long. 176 deg. 30 min. E. the wind blowing hard, the Adventure brought to under the fore&s;ail, main and mizen &s;tay &s;ails.</P>
<P>On the 24th they got &s;ight of the Re&s;olu|tion about eleven in the forenoon three or four leagues to leeward. At two in the after|noon they wore &s;hip, made &s;ail, and bore down to the Re&s;olution. Lat. 41 deg. 31 min. long. 175 deg. 28 E.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="98">On the 25th the gale increa&s;ed, with rain, and &s;udden &s;qualls. About ten in the fore|noon they handed the top&s;ails and cour&s;es; and at eleven brought to under the mizen-&s;tay&s;ail. At noon latitude 42 deg. 16 min. long. 174 deg. 58 min. E.</P>
<P>On the 26th fre&s;h gales, and cloudy wea|ther. At four in the morning wore &s;hip, and made &s;ail. At night lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olu|tion in lat. 42 deg. 33 min. long. 174 deg. 42 min.</P>
<P>On the 28th hard gales, and &s;qually. At &s;ix in the morning they again got &s;ight of the Re&s;olution, bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tance about &s;even or eight miles. At eight they &s;aw Cape Palli&s;er, bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tance nine or ten leagues. At half pa&s;t nine they wore &s;hip. At three in the afternoon they wore &s;hip, and made &s;ail. Latitude at noon 42 deg. 18 min. long. 175 deg. 10 min.</P>
<P>On the 29th fre&s;h gales and &s;qually, with thunder, lightning, and rain. This day they imagined the Re&s;olution had got into harbour, as they never &s;aw her afterwards. Latitude at noon 42 deg. 24 min. S. longitude 175 deg. 49 min. E.</P>
<P>On the 30th, the rough weather continuing, at five in the morning they wore &s;hip. At noon brought to under the main, fore, and mizen-&s;tay&s;ail; but at three in the afternoon,
<PB N="87" REF="99">
the weather being more moderate, they made &s;ail; at five wore &s;hip; at &s;ix they came in &s;ight of Cape Palli&s;er, bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tance about &s;even or eight leagues. At half after eight wore &s;hip, and brought to. At ten they wore &s;hip; but before morning they were driven out of &s;ight of land.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, the weather &s;till tempe&s;tuous, at nine in the morning they &s;et the fore&s;ail and main-top&s;ail. At noon handed the main-top|&s;ail, wore &s;hip, furled the cour&s;es, and brought to under the main and mizen-&s;tay&s;ails. At three in the afternoon the weather became more moderate, they &s;et cour&s;es and top&s;ails, and at eleven at night wore &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of November the weather be|came more tempe&s;tuous.</P>
<P>On the 2d it thundered, lightned, and rain|ed. At five in the morning they came again in &s;ight of land, Cape Palli&s;er bearing W. two-thirds N. di&s;tance about nine leagues. Their water being now almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and no pro&s;pect of making the de&s;tined harbour, every man's allowance was reduced to one quart a-day.</P>
<P>On the 4th the weather became moderate; and being within a few miles of the &s;hore, the Indians came off in their canoes, and brought craw-fi&s;h in great plenty, which were &s;oon bought up by the &s;hip's crew.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="100">On the 5th it blew a &s;torm. At one in the morning they wore &s;hip, handed the cour&s;es, and brought to. At &s;even Cape Palli&s;er bore N. E. three-fourths N. di&s;tance not above five or &s;ix miles; but after many ineffectual efforts to make Cooke's Straits, their water being nearly &s;pent, and the men worn out with fa|tigue, the Captain found it expedient to make for Talaga-bay, to refre&s;h and procure a &s;upply.</P>
<P>On the 9th they came a-brea&s;t of that bay, in lat. 38 deg. 22 min. S. long. 179 deg. E. and at eleven in the forenoon anchored in 12 fathom water. Though little was to be ex|pected here from the account given by Capt. Cooke in his former voyage, yet the &s;hip was hardly moored when great numbers of the natives came along &s;ide in their canoes, but our journali&s;t has left us to gue&s;s whether they came to trade, or only to gratify their curio&s;ity. It was at an i&s;land in this bay where the Endeavour's people ob&s;erved the large&s;t canoe they met with during their whole voyage, of which Mr. Parkin&s;on has given a cut. It was, according to account, no le&s;s than &s;ixty-eight feet and a half long, five broad, and three feet &s;ix inches high; it had a &s;harp bottom, con&s;i&s;ting of three trunks of trees hollowed; of which that in the mid|dle was the longe&s;t; the &s;ide planks were
<PB N="89" REF="101">
&s;ixty-two feet long in one piece, and were ornamented with carvings not unlike fillegree work, in &s;pirals of very curious workman|&s;hip, the extremities whereof were clo&s;ed with a figure that formed the head of the ve&s;&s;el, in which were two mon&s;trous eyes of mother of pearl, and a large heart-&s;haped tongue, and as it de&s;cended it &s;till retained the figure of a mon&s;ter, with hands and feet carved upon it very neatly, and painted red. It had al&s;o a high peaked &s;tern, wrought in fillegree, and adorned with feathers, from the top of which depended two long &s;treamers made of feathers, which almo&s;t reached the water." From this de&s;cription one might be tempted to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e canoes to be the ve&s;&s;els, and this to be the Great Counrty lying to the &s;outh of which Quiros received intelligence at Taumaco; and where Toobia &s;aid they eat men, and had &s;uch large &s;hips that the Engli&s;h &s;hip was &s;mall in compari&s;on. Be this as it may, our voy|agers &s;hortened their &s;tay in this harbour, be|ing impatient to join the Re&s;olution in order to continue the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 10th of November, the boats were manned, and &s;ent on &s;hore for a &s;upply of wood and water; and a guard of marines was ordered to accompany them in order to pro|tect from in&s;ult the people employed on tho&s;e &s;ervices. All the remaining part of the crew
<PB N="90" REF="102">
were employed in &s;topping leaks, and repair|ing the rigging, which was now in a mo&s;t ruinous condition.</P>
<P>On the 11th having got on board a &s;mall &s;upply, the weather tolerable, and the wind fair, they hoi&s;ted in the boats, unmoored, and at noon weighed and came to &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 12th hard gales and &s;qualley with rain. At eight in the morning they bore up, but could make no way; &s;o were again obliged to run into Talago-bay. At noon they came too, moored, and hoi&s;ted out the boats to increa&s;e their &s;upply of wood and water.</P>
<P>The 13th they were employed as before.</P>
<P>On the 14th the &s;urff ran &s;o high that the boats could not make land.</P>
<P>The 15th was employed in getting on board more wood and water.</P>
<P>And on the 16th at three in the morning they unmoored, and before &s;ix got under way and came to &s;ea.</P>
<P>From this time to the 28th, nothing but tempe&s;tuous weather; in which their rigging was almo&s;t all blown to pieces; and the men quite worn down with fatigue.</P>
<P>On the 29th the water which they had ob|tained with &s;o much labour before being nearly expended, they were again reduced to the &s;canty allowance of a quart per man a day.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="103">On the 30th, by good providence, the wea|ther becoming more moderate, they made Cooke's Straits; and at three in the afternoon ca&s;t anchor in Charlotte Sound.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t enquiry they made was, Whether any in&s;tructions had been left for them by the Re&s;olution; and upon examination, a letter was found, importing, that the Re&s;olution had &s;et &s;ail &s;ix days before, but as to any other intimations it might contain, our jour|nali&s;t is altogether &s;ilent.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of December the tents were carried on &s;hore, the &s;ick landed, the ar|mourers forge put up; and in &s;hort every preparation made to refit the &s;hip, and to re|cover the numerous &s;ick. Here the Indians came on board with great familiarity, brought fi&s;h and what el&s;e they had to &s;ell, and &s;eemed to behave with great civility, and to traffic hone&s;tly; but this behaviour was but of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>On the 13th in the night a party of them came down and robbed the a&s;tronomer's tent of every thing they could carry away. This they did &s;o quietly, that they were not &s;o much as heard, or &s;u&s;pected, till the a&s;trono|mer getting up to take an ob&s;ervation, mi&s;&s;ed his in&s;truments, and charged the centinel with being the robber. This brought on a pretty
<PB N="92" REF="104">
&s;evere altercation, during which they &s;pied an Indian creeping from the tent, and Mr. Bai|ley fired at and wounded him, but he made &s;hift, notwith&s;tanding, to run into the woods and e&s;cape. The report of the gun had a|larmed his companions, who likewi&s;e, in&s;tead of taking to their canoe, fled into the woods, leaving their boat with mo&s;t of the things that had been &s;tolen, in it, a-ground upon the beach. This it is more than probable laid the founda|tion of that dreadful cata&s;trophe which &s;oon followed.</P>
<P>On the 17th while they were preparing for their departure, the large cutter, manned with &s;even &s;eamen, under the command of Mr. John Roe, the fir&s;t mate, accompanied by Mr. Woodhou&s;e, mid&s;hipman, and James To|bias Swilley, the carpenter's &s;ervant, was &s;ent up the Sound to Gra&s;s Cove, to gather greens and wild celery.</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon the tents were &s;truck, every thing got on board, and the &s;hip made ready for &s;ailing the next day. Night coming on, and no cutter appearing, the captain and officers began to expre&s;s great unea&s;ine&s;s, fearing &s;ome treachery from the &s;avages. They &s;at up the whole night in ex|pectation of her arrival; but to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;At day-break, the captain ordered the long-boat
<PB N="93" REF="105">
to be hoi&s;ted out, and double manned, with Mr. Burney, &s;econd lieutenant, Mr. Free|man, ma&s;ter, the corporal of the Marines, with five private men, all well armed, with plenty of ammunition, two wall-pieces, and three days provi&s;ion. Thus equipped, about nine in the morning they left the &s;hip, and rowed and &s;ailed for Ea&s;t Bay, keeping clo&s;e in &s;hore, and examining every creek they pa&s;&s;ed, to find the cutter: they continued their &s;earch till two in the afternoon, when they put into a &s;mall cove to dre&s;s dinner.&mdash;While that was getting ready, a company of Indians were ob&s;erved, &s;eemingly very bu&s;y on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, upon which they left their dinner, and rowed precipitately to the place where the &s;avages were a&s;&s;embled. Upon their approach the Indians immediately fled; they followed them clo&s;ely to a little town, which they found de&s;erted, but while they were employed in &s;earching their huts, the Indians returned, and made a &s;hew of re&s;i&s;t|ance, but &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents being made their chiefs, they were very &s;oon appea&s;ed. However, on their return to the boat the &s;a|vages again followed them, and &s;ome of them threw &s;tones. After they had dined they re|newed their &s;earch, and at proper intervals kept firing their wall-pieces, as &s;ignals to the
<PB N="94" REF="106">
cutter, if any of her people &s;hould happen to be within hearing.</P>
<P>About five in the afternoon they opened a &s;mall bay, where they &s;aw a large double ca|noe, and a body of Indians hauling her up upon the beach. They quickened their cour&s;e to come up with them, but the &s;avages in|&s;tantly fled on &s;eeing them approach, which made them &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome mi&s;chief had been done. On landing, the fir&s;t thing they &s;aw in the canoe, was one of the cutter's row|lock-boards, and a pair of &s;hoes tied up to|gether. On advancing farther up the beach, they found &s;everal of their peoples ba&s;kets, and &s;aw one of their dogs eating a piece of broiled fle&s;h, which upon examining they &s;u&s;pected to be human, and having found in one of the ba&s;kets a hand, which they knew to be the left hand of Thomas Hill, by the letters T. H. being marked on it, they were no longer in &s;u&s;pence about the event. They pur&s;ued the &s;avages as far as was practicable; but without &s;ucce&s;s. On their return they de|&s;troyed the canoe, and continued their &s;earch. At half after &s;ix in the evening, they opened Gra&s;s-Cove, where they &s;aw a great many In|dians a&s;&s;embled on the Beach, and &s;ix or &s;even canoes floating in the &s;urf; they &s;tood in &s;hore, and as &s;oon as the &s;avages &s;aw them, they re|treated to a ri&s;ing hill, clo&s;e by the water-&s;ide.

The lieutenant being doubtful, whether their retreat proceeded from fear, or a de&s;ign to de|coy them to an ambu&s;cade, determined not to be &s;urprized, and therefore, running clo&s;e in &s;hore, ordered the grappling to be dropt near enough to reach them with the guns, but at too great a di&s;tance to be under any apprehen|&s;ion from their treachery. In this po&s;ition they began to engage, taking aim, and determining to kill as many of them as their guns could reach. It was &s;ometime before they di&s;lodged them; but, at length many of them being wounded, and &s;ome killed, they began to di&s;|per&s;e. The Lieutenant improved their panic, and &s;upported by the officers and marines, leapt on &s;hore, and pur&s;ued the fugitives. They had not advanced far from the water &s;ide, before they beheld the mo&s;t horrible &s;ight that ever was &s;een by any European; the heads, hearts, livers and lights of three or four of their peo|ple broiling on the fire, and their bowels lying at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix yards from the fire, with &s;everal of their hands and limbs, in a mangled condition, &s;ome broiled, and &s;ome raw; but no other parts of their bodies, which gave cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that the cannibals had fea&s;ted and eaten all the re&s;t. They ob&s;erved a large body of them a&s;&s;embled on a hill about two miles di&s;tance; but night coming on, they dur&s;t not advance to attack them; nei|ther
<PB N="96" REF="109">
was it thought &s;afe to quit the &s;hore, to take account of the number killed, their body being but &s;mall, and the &s;avages numerous and fierce. They were armed with long lances, and weapons, not unlike a &s;erjeants halbert in &s;hape, made of hard wood, and in&s;tead of iron, mounted with bone. They could di&s;cover no|thing belonging to the cutter, but one of the oars, which was broken and &s;tuck in the &s;and, and the fa&s;tenings of the Indians canoes tied to it. It was &s;u&s;pected that the dead bodies of their people had been divided among the dif|ferent parties of &s;avages that had been con|cerned in the ma&s;&s;acre; and it was not im|probable but that the party that was &s;een at a di&s;tance, were fea&s;ting upon &s;ome of the others, as tho&s;e on the &s;hore had been upon what were found, before they were di&s;turbed by the crew of the long-boat; be that as it may, they could di&s;cover no traces of more than four of their bodies, nor could they tell where the &s;a|vages had concealed the cutter. It was now near night, and the Lieutenant not thinking it &s;afe to tru&s;t the crew in the dark, in an open boat, within reach of &s;uch cruel barbarians, ordered the canoes to be broken up and de|&s;troyed, and carefully collecting the remains of their mangled companions, they made the be&s;t of their way from this polluted place, and got on board the &s;hip before midnight. The

remains of the bodies brought on board were examined by the &s;urgeon, but he could not make out to whom they belonged; &s;o they were decently laid together, and with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity ob&s;erved on board &s;hips, com|mitted to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>From the account which the cannibals gave of this ma&s;&s;acre to Capt. Cooke on his third vi&s;it to this i&s;land, there was rea&s;on to believe that they had not only murdered the crew, but made prize of the &s;hip: and they gave it as a rea&s;on for their outrage, that the &s;trangers had been the aggre&s;&s;ors, and that &s;ome of their countrymen had been fir&s;t put to death with|out provocation. This, there is no doubt, al|luded to the Indian &s;hot by the a&s;tronomer's &s;entry, as already related.</P>
<P>It was the 19th of December before the Adventure could be in readine&s;s to follow the Re&s;olution, who, on the 25th of November &s;et &s;ail from Charlotte Sound; and after &s;pending &s;ome time in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch after the Adventure, took her departure from New Zealand on the 26th, and pur&s;ued her voyage.</P>
<P>It was however the 22d before the Adven|ture got clear of land; and then the cloaths and effects of the ten men who were murdered and eaten, were &s;old before the ma&s;t, accord|ing to the old &s;ea cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="111">Nothing material happened till January the 1&s;t, when &s;trong gales and rainy weather came on, and when, by rea&s;on of the lofty &s;eas, they were obliged to lye to. Towards night the violence of the gale abated, and the wind be|ing at we&s;t, and their cour&s;e S. S. E. they made &s;ail, and proceeded on their voyage at a great rate.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January, being in latitude 58 deg. 17 min. S. and in long. 212 deg. E. they came in &s;ight of &s;everal i&s;lands of ice. The thermometer 34 deg.</P>
<P>From the 12th of January till the 31&s;t of the &s;ame month, it &s;hould &s;eem that they pro|ceeded nearly in the &s;ame cour&s;e, &s;teering to the ea&s;tward with half a point to the &s;outh, till on the 1&s;t of February they found them|&s;elves in 61 deg. 20 min. S. and to the ea&s;t|ward of Cape Horn, which was no &s;mall plea|&s;ure to the common &s;eamen, who having made no di&s;covery in this long run, began to rejoice at the thoughts of &s;oon &s;eeing their own coun|try, the dangers of di&s;covery being now pa&s;t. They were the more elated as thinking them|&s;elves the fir&s;t who had ever pa&s;&s;ed Cape Horn in an ea&s;terly cour&s;e; but in this they were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>On the 3d their allowance of provi&s;ions was augmented to the full complement, and their brandy to an allowance and a half, on account
<PB N="99" REF="112">
of the &s;everity of the weather, which, though the &s;ummer was but ju&s;t pa&s;t its prime in that hemi&s;phere, was yet &s;o &s;evere that it froze daily, with &s;now and &s;leet.</P>
<P>On the 26th of February they pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of London in lat. 54 deg. 24 min. S. and in &s;urrounding the globe to the ea&s;tward, having gained a day, they altered their &s;tyle, calling this the 27th. From this time to the 25th of March the weather proved rough and &s;tor|my; but the wind favouring, they continued their cour&s;e to the Cape of Good Hope, and on the 17th came in &s;ight of Table-bay, bear|ing ea&s;t about ten or twelve leagues.</P>
<P>On the 19th of March they ca&s;t anchor at the Cape; and on the 13th of July about &s;even in the morning they came in &s;ight of Plymouth, from whence they had taken their departure ju&s;t two years before; and on the 15th anchored &s;afe at Spithead.</P>
<P>Thus having traced the track of the Adven|ture, from her fir&s;t &s;etting out till her return, the reader will no doubt be impatient till we re&s;ume the thread of our narrative with re&s;pect to the Re&s;olution, which we left &s;afely moored in Charlotte Sound.</P>
<P>It was on Wedne&s;day the 3d of November that the Re&s;olution ca&s;t anchor in her former birth, being convenient for taking on board both wood and water. After the u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="100" REF="113">
of landing tents, ca&s;ks, &amp;c. &amp;c. was over, and the crew had time to make enquiries, they were told that &s;ome &s;trange Indians had been there, and had eaten all the goats, hogs, and poultry, that the Captain had put on &s;hore alive at his la&s;t vi&s;it to breed; and that they did not be|lieve a &s;ingle one was to be met with in the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 5th the copper oven was put on &s;hore for the bakers to bake bread for the &s;hip's u&s;e; the brewers were as fully employ|ed in brewing beer for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t vigilance of the watch, the Indians found means to &s;teal and carry away &s;everal of the brewing uten&s;ils, which however were again recovered.</P>
<P>On the 6th a great many of them came along&s;ide the &s;hip, and brought &s;everal of their weapons and curio&s;ities to &s;ell; but were very loth to di&s;po&s;e of their battle-axes, on which they &s;eem to &s;et the greate&s;t value. Fi&s;h too they brought in abundance. As &s;oon as they had made their market they returned to &s;hore, and hauling their canoes up among the bu&s;hes, made a fire, and, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed what they had to eat.</P>
<P>While the bakers and brewers were em|ployed on &s;hore, the &s;teward was no le&s;s bu&s;y in examining the bi&s;cuit ca&s;ks on board, many of which proved damp, and the bread in them
<PB N="101" REF="114">
un&s;erviceable; that which was good was &s;epa|rated from the bad, and packed again in fre&s;h ca&s;ks; what was &s;oft, but eatable, was &s;ent a&s;hore to be rebaked; and that which was ut|terly unfit for the mens u&s;e, was pre&s;erved to feed the hogs and fowls. Thus care was taken that nothing might be wa&s;ted; and that every thing &s;hould be applied to its proper u&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;urvey of the &s;hip's &s;tores, the pow|der was found to be damp; it was nece&s;&s;ary therefore that it &s;hould be carried a&s;hore, and dried. The rats had been bu&s;y in the &s;ail|room, and had eaten their way through and through the canvas. This was a grievous mis|fortune to the &s;ail-makers, who had already employment more than &s;ufficient to repair the rents torn by the weather. While in harbour here no portion of time was allowed for indul|gence; even Sunday was employed in re-bak|ing, packing, and &s;towing the bread, as this was judged a work of nece&s;&s;ity, and therefore allowable in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. But while the crew was thus kept to labour, the greate&s;t at|tention was paid to their health: they had every day plenty of celery, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, and other whole&s;ome plants to boil with their pea&s;e, in which likewi&s;e a quantity of portable &s;oup was always an ingredient.</P>
<P>After continuing here about three weeks, and no tidings of the Adventure, and all
<PB N="102" REF="115">
things being in forwardne&s;s to proceed to &s;ea, the men had leave by turns to divert them|&s;elves on &s;hore; but here the inducements were wanting that made them &s;o fond of land at the Society I&s;les. The women, though not ugly, are yet cha&s;te; and it was as much as life was worth for a &s;ailor to attempt the lea&s;t rude|ne&s;s to any of their wives, or even to their daughters, without permi&s;&s;ion. Few of the common men therefore cho&s;e to wander among the woods and de&s;erts where nothing was to be hoped, but much to be apprehended from the treachery of the natives, who, friendly as they may appear to be when awed by fear, are not to be tru&s;ted when under no re&s;traint.</P>
<P>A party of officers having one day made an excur&s;ion to take a view of the country, and to mark the manners and way of living of the natives among them&s;elves, called at a little cove, a few miles from the &s;hore where a company of them generally lived, and found them fea&s;ting on a man whom they had not long before killed, as was apparent from the fre&s;hne&s;s of the fle&s;h. They &s;eemed not at all di&s;concerted at the approach of the &s;tran|gers, but very civilly invited them by &s;igns to &s;it down and eat; and, as the greate&s;t dainty, they brought them the man's head from the lower jaw upwards ready dre&s;&s;ed, which, as well may be &s;uppo&s;ed, they refu&s;ed.
<PB N="103" REF="116">
They then pre&s;ented the ha&s;elet of the man ju&s;t warmed, and making &s;igns expre&s;|&s;ive of the &s;avourine&s;s of the meat, pre&s;&s;ed them to eat, and &s;eemingly with &s;ome re&s;ent|ment that they did not. The gentlemen, how|ever, though they declined eating, made &s;igns that they were not unwilling to pay for the head, provided it would be no affront to them to carry it away; to this they readily con&s;ent|ed, and the gentlemen brought the head on board, with which they afterwards treated an Indian-chief, who eat it greedily in pre&s;ence of the whole &s;hips crew; an inconte&s;table proof of their eating human fle&s;h, if any had been wanting to confirm the truth of &s;o inhuman a practice.</P>
<P>It may be worth remarking, as we do not remember to have &s;een the &s;ame thing noticed by former voyagers, that all the teeth were mi&s;|&s;ing in the head purcha&s;ed by the officers, and that they &s;eem to &s;et a great value upon the teeth, by wearing them either as trophies or ornaments in their ears.</P>
<P>Being curious to know the rea&s;on of putting the man to death, on whom they were found fea&s;ting, they gave the gentlemen to under|&s;tand, that they had lately been at war with the North-I&s;land Indians; that they had made twenty of their enemies pri&s;oners, whom they kept alive in places of &s;ecurity; and that they
<PB N="104" REF="117">
put them to death occa&s;ionally as they wanted to make a fea&s;t.</P>
<P>For a de&s;cription of their weapons of war, as they have already been delineated in the voyages to the Southern Hemi&s;phere, by Eng|li&s;h navigators, we refer the reader to that entertaining work. It may, however, be proper ju&s;t to mention that &s;ome of their pikes or javelins are 36 feet long, and that they throw the&s;e to a great di&s;tance with incredible force; and that the weapon they u&s;e for clo&s;e fight being about three feet long, &s;haped not unlike our bats, but with a broad back and &s;harp edge, is &s;o weighty as to cleave a man's &s;kull at one blow.</P>
<P>In the evening of the day the officers vi&s;it|ed the country, they heard from the &s;hip a grievous yelling, which clo&s;ed with the mo&s;t terrifying &s;hrieks that any man on board ever heard. Something of the &s;ame kind had been heard by former navigators; and as the&s;e noi&s;es came at the clo&s;e of the day from the dark rece&s;&s;es of the woods, there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the victims of their revenge, or their depraved appetite, are then &s;acrificed to their prevailing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our voyagers had now been in harbour from the 3d of November to the 24th without know|ing the fate of the Adventure. It was the prevailing opinion among the &s;eamen that &s;he
<PB N="105" REF="118">
mu&s;t either have been wrecked or &s;o much da|maged as not to be able to proceed upon her voyage; but the Captain was of another opi|nion; he cau&s;ed a letter to be written, and in|clo&s;ed in a bottle, directing his a&s;&s;ociate what cour&s;e to &s;teer, and to ha&s;ten his departure as &s;oon as his &s;hip &s;hould be in a condition to proceed, and he cau&s;ed the place where the bottle was concealed to be engraven upon a tree, which was not likely to be ob&s;erved by the natives, but could not e&s;cape the notice of the &s;hips company, when they came to exa|mine the adjacent coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 24th, the Captain having previou&s;|ly landed &s;ome live animals on an unfrequent|ed part of the country, where they were not likely to be di&s;covered by the Indians, with a view to their multiplying for a &s;upply to fu|ture navigators, gave orders for all his people to come on board; to unmoor, and to prepare to &s;ail; and here it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that a complaint having been made by a native again&s;t one of the &s;ailors, and that complaint, upon examination, being found ju&s;t, he cau&s;ed the man to be puni&s;hed in the &s;ight of the Indian, and to receive twelve &s;evere la&s;hes.</P>
<P>On the 25th they weighed and came to &s;ail, but the wind fetting full into the &s;trait, it was night before they cleared the channel.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="119">Next day they &s;pent in looking for the Ad|venture, firing guns every half hour as they proceeded with an ea&s;y &s;ail along &s;hore, and narrowly viewing every inlet, in order to di&s;|cover the remains of the wreck, if any di&s;a&s;ter of that kind had happened to her, and to give relief to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed crew, if any remained alive; but the guns not being an&s;wered, nor any appearance of a wreck to be &s;een, and only a &s;moke to be ob&s;erved, which upon examina|tion was found to proceed from a fire kindled by the natives; the wind proving fair, the weather fine, and a bri&s;k breeze &s;pringing up in the evening, they took leave of the i&s;land and proceeded on their voyage with a full &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 27th a &s;tiff gale from N. N. W. carried away the main top-ma&s;t-&s;tay-yard, which was &s;oon re&s;tored, and they jovially continued their cour&s;e to the S. S. E. being in high &s;pirits and full allowance. Lat. at noon 43 deg. 28 min. S.</P>
<P>As a voyage in an unfrequented &s;ea, where no new object pre&s;ented them&s;elves to vary the &s;cene, can afford but little entertainment to the generality of readers, we &s;hall ju&s;t pre&s;erve &s;o much of the nautical manoevres as minute|ly to mark the track which the Re&s;olution pur|&s;ed, that the intelligent reader may be enabled to judge what foundation there &s;till remains,
<PB N="107" REF="120">
for &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;outhern continent to exi&s;t, though yet undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>It is indeed to be regretted that our journa|li&s;t has rather been deficient in noting the lon|gitude from day to day, in like manner as he has done the latitude, but that defect may be in a great mea&s;ure &s;upplied by comparing the cour&s;e with the latitude, and &s;uppo&s;ing a me|dium for the &s;hip's ca&s;ting in any given time, deducible from the time, and the &s;pace between the periods, where the longitude is accurately recorded. This much being here thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e we &s;hall now proceed.</P>
<P>On the 28th the weather continuing fine, and the wind dying away, they made but little progre&s;s. Some of the people on the watch &s;aw the trunk of a tree floating by the &s;hip, and &s;aw likewi&s;e two large &s;eals.

either to the &s;outhward or ea&s;tward; they were therefore obliged to tack &s;hip, in order to get clear.

<P>16. The weather having cleared up, and the &s;ea become calm, they &s;ent the boats out to bring in ice, as had been practi&s;ed before in the &s;ame latitude, in order to lengthen out their &s;tock of water; for though they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dr. Irvin's Apparatus for mak|ing &s;alt water fre&s;h at &s;ea, and though they made frequent u&s;e of it, di&s;tilling &s;ometimes forty gallons a day, yet this natural di&s;tilla|tion (if it may be &s;o called) from the clouds, was &s;o much preferable, that the fir&s;t was only made u&s;e of to &s;upply the animals on board, while the other was preferred by the chiefe&s;t officers.

on before the boats were half loaded, they were glad to get a-board with their lives; but not without con&s;iderable damage to the boats. This day they &s;aw a large whale at a di&s;tance; but the breeze fre&s;hening they &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>17. The wind varying N. by W. and N. N. W. they made &s;ail and &s;teered N. E. by E. in order to clear the ice. But the wind dying away and the &s;ea appearing calm, they hoi&s;ted out the pinnace as well as the boats; and renewed the labour of watering the &s;hip with ice with double ardour. It had been found very grievous to tho&s;e who had been obliged to plunge their hands in the &s;ea to lift up the loo&s;e ice; and therefore the Captain furni&s;hed the people who manned the boats with pick-axes, &s;ledge hammers, and double-headed hatchets, to cleave it and break it from the &s;olid bodies that floated on the waves. This, though the labour was hard, was much more tolerable than lifting the pieces out of the water; and was perfomed with more chearfulne&s;s, e&s;pecially as every man was en|couraged with a dram when he went out, and rewarded with another when he returned.</P>
<P>During the morning this labour was con|tinued without intermi&s;&s;ion; but in the after|noon a fall of &s;now came on, the like of which we can form no idea of in this part of the

For a while it cea&s;ed; but then again it fell by handfulls, and filled the &s;hips decks &s;o &s;ud|denly that double the men on board with all their efforts could not have cleared them as fa&s;t as it fell. The rigging too was &s;o enlarg|ed with ice and &s;now that the running-tackle was rendered altogether u&s;ele&s;s till the &s;torm abated. Their latitude at noon was 64 deg. 30 min. and the pinnace and boats being for|tunately hoi&s;ted on board before the fall came on, they continued their cour&s;e E. N.

<P>Jan. 1, 1774. Fine light breeze from the ea&s;tward. Cour&s;e N. W. Latitude at noon by ob&s;ervation 59 deg. 11 min. This day a quarrel happened between two of the mid&s;hip|men that had like to have proved fatal to both. One of them having drank too much, was very abu&s;ive, and provoked the other to &s;trike him; on which the former drew his knife, which the latter catched at with his hand, by which he &s;aved his life, but cut him&s;elf &s;everely. They were then parted, and the aggre&s;&s;or put in irons; but, when in irons, behaved &s;o turbu|lently, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to double iron him, to confine his hands behind his back, and to place a centinel over him.</P>

<P>25. The wind at north attended with light &s;now, &s;aw &s;ix albatro&s;&s;es, &s;ome ice-birds, and three Pintada birds, called by the Dutch Cape Doves. Lat. at noon by ob&s;ervation, 65 deg. 26 min. long. 248 E.</P>
<P>Here they &s;aw no ice, though in the &s;ame latitude in the former trip to the &s;outhward they were &s;urrounded by it. Po&s;&s;ibly the lat|ter

<P>The Indian begins to be impatient to &s;ee England. He is &s;till indulged in the captain's cabin; is learning to write; but gets little or no Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>26. At nine in the morning every body on deck imagined they &s;aw land; and accord|ingly preparations were made for getting all things in readine&s;s to ca&s;t anchor. At eleven cro&s;&s;ed the antarctic circle to the &s;outhward for the 2d time, and hauled up S. E. by E. where they were per&s;uaded land was. But to their great di&s;appointment, the farther they &s;ailed, the farther the land &s;eemed to bear from them; and at length it wholly vani&s;hed. Lat. at noon 66 deg. 35 min. Sounded, but found no bottom.</P>
<P>27. Mi&s;ty weather, but moderate. At &s;e|ven in the morning it cleared up, and they altered their cour&s;e to the S. E. &s;till in hope of land. Wind N. N. E. Lat. at noon, by ob&s;ervation, 67 deg. 58 min. Pa&s;&s;ed one large i&s;land of ice, and &s;everal i&s;lets of various forms. Saw &s;everal whales, &s;ome Pintada birds, and two &s;trange birds, &s;uch as they had never &s;een before, and thought to be land-birds, with a great flock of &s;ea &s;wallows, which the &s;ailors call Mother Carey's Chickens,

and dread their appearance as an omen of tempe&s;tuous weather. The&s;e, our journali&s;t &s;ays, were more beautiful than any they had ever &s;een before, their glo&s;&s;y feathers of black, red, and white, being &s;o happily intermixed as to produce a colouring that exceeds all de&s;|cription.</P>
<P>28. The weather continuing moderate, and the &s;ea open, they &s;till pur&s;ued their cour&s;e to the S. S. E. though at the utmo&s;t peril of their lives, from the large bodies of ice that were continually floating round them. Their latitude was this day at noon 69 deg. 33 min. South; in the afternoon they veered a little to the Ea&s;t. At one in the morning they &s;aw the &s;un and moon exactly at the &s;ame height, viz. ten degrees above the horizon, and both appeared equally illuminated, owing perhaps to the hazine&s;s of the atmo&s;phere. Here they went to work again in digging and loading ice to melt into water; but here they were more unfortunate than in their former attempts, having the pinnace &s;tove again&s;t the i&s;land on which the men were at work; and it was with difficulty that her crew recovered the &s;hip.</P>
<P>29. The i&s;lands of ice began to multiply, and the loo&s;e ice to incorporate; but the wea|ther continued moderate, and generally clear. Lat. at noon, by ob&s;ervation, 69 deg. 58&frac12; min.

<P>30. Came in &s;ight of a fog bank, which had a great appearance of land, and many who were thought the be&s;t judges a&s;&s;erted that it was land; however it proved upon trial a deception, as well as the former. This day they pa&s;&s;ed by a great i&s;land of ice, and heard many dreadful cracks, as if the whole earth was cleaving a&s;under. Saw &s;everal whales and a &s;trange bird as before. Taking a view from the ma&s;t-head nothing was to be &s;een but a dreary pro&s;pect of ice and &s;ea. Of the former might be &s;een a whole country as far as the eye could carry one, diver&s;ified with hills and dales, and fields and imaginary plantations, that had all the appearance of cultivation; yet was nothing more than the &s;ports of chance in the formation of tho&s;e immen&s;e bo|dies of congregated ice. This &s;econd attempt at di&s;covery of land in this dreary region being attended with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the fir&s;t, the captain thought it advi&s;eable to give over the pur&s;uit for the pre&s;ent, and once more to direct the &s;hip's cour&s;e to the northward.&mdash;Lat. this day at noon 71 deg. 10 min. long. 252 deg. 2 min.

E. at noon they fell into lat. 69 deg. 54 min. very cold, and the weather beginning to alter. In the even|ing the &s;now, which ju&s;t began to fall lightly about noon, came down heavily, and gave full employment to the watch to beat it off as it froze upon the rigging. This was grie|vous work; but as it in a great mea&s;ure pre|cluded the nece&s;&s;ity of digging and filling ice from the i&s;lands to melt, it was &s;ubmitted to chearfully, e&s;pecially as the &s;ame encourage|ment and the &s;ame reward were be&s;towed for the one as well as for the other. Wind variable from E. to E. N. E. intolerably cold. Ship's head as before.</P>

They were now in a temperate climate, and, as the &s;hip's company rightly &s;uppo&s;ed, were directing their cour&s;e in pur&s;uit of that country which Juan Fernandes is &s;aid to have di&s;covered, and which by very many able na|vigators has been <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> and by &s;ome <HI>affirm|ed,</HI> to be part of the Terra Incognita Au&s;tralis. Of this opinion is Arias, a Spani&s;h writer, who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"that a pilot named Juan Fernandes &s;ailing from the coa&s;t of Chili, about the lati|tude of 40 deg.

M. Pingre, a French writer, reports, <Q REND="inline">"that the Captain of a Spani&s;h brigantine going from Calloa to the i&s;land of Chiloe in 1714, being in the latitude of 38 deg.

At five &s;he re|turned with news, that at the di&s;tance of five miles from the i&s;land there was &s;afe anchoring. On board the boat came one of the natives, a man of a middling &s;tature, curiou&s;ly tataowed from head to foot. His language was different from that of any of the i&s;landers they had yet vi&s;ited, &s;o that he was no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood by the Indian, nor by any other man on board, except by &s;igns. The i&s;land had no very pro|mi&s;ing appearance on their approach towards it, they could &s;ee indeed at the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even miles up the country a number of hou&s;es, but no cocoa-nut or other large trees, no beau|tiful plantations, &s;uch as they &s;aw on the i&s;lands of Middleburg, and Am&s;terdam, but a low level green within land, defended from the &s;ea by craggs and rocks near the &s;hore. The
<PB N="139" REF="152">
wind &s;till proving contrary, they ca&s;t anchor where directed.</P>
<P>14. The Captain ordered the pinnace to be hoi&s;ted out, and the great and &s;mall cutters to be manned; and he, attended by his chief of|ficers, and accompanied by Mr. Fo&s;ter, went on &s;hore about &s;ix in the morning, and return|ed on board again about nine. The wind coming fair they weighed, and &s;tood in clo&s;e to land, and again came to an anchor about two miles from land in 40 fathom water. Se|veral of the natives came on board, the great|e&s;t part of whom &s;wam from the &s;hore, and a few came in wretched canoes, old and rotten, and &s;o &s;mall that three people could barely &s;it in them: they were indeed of a pretty con|&s;truction, but the materials were the wor&s;t they had ever &s;een made u&s;e of; nor was it ea&s;y to conceive how, or where they procured the materials, as no trees were to be &s;een on the i&s;land even by tho&s;e who were &s;ent to &s;urvey it. Canoes, indeed, &s;eemed le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, as hardly any fi&s;h was to be &s;een upon the coa&s;t; from whence it is imagined, that the natives live wholly upon fowls and vegetables, no four-footed animal being mentioned in any of the relations.</P>
<P>The people on board made &s;igns that they wanted provi&s;ions, and &s;hewed them &s;everal articles; &s;uch as nails, beads, looking-gla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="140" REF="153">
knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and the like, which they made &s;igns they would give in exchange: they al&s;o &s;hewed them &s;ome linen, and Otaheite-cloth. They preferred the linen, becau&s;e it was white; and indeed any thing of that colour &s;eemed to plea&s;e them be&s;t. The chief articles they brought to &s;ell were fowls, &s;weet potatoes, a few plantains, and &s;ome bananas; but fruit as well as other provi&s;ions were in no great plenty among them. The Chiefs on their fir&s;t coming on board, brought five or &s;ix fowls ready barbicued as pre&s;ents to the Captain, who in return loaded them with trifles of &s;mall value, with which they were exceedingly plea&s;|ed. The men were of the middle &s;tature, &s;trong, and apparently healthy: they were naked above and below the middle, and had only a kind of broad net-work girdle to &s;ur|round the wai&s;t. The women were covered with a garment from head to foot, and were be&s;ides, painted with a variety of colours, &s;uch as orange, red, yellow, and white. They ap|proach the neare&s;t to the New Zealanders in habit and appearance of any people they had yet &s;een. Tho&s;e who came on board had no arms; but the party that was &s;ent out to re|connoitre the country, found arms among&s;t them that were very different in every re&s;pect from the arms of the i&s;landers in the tropical regions. They remarked likewi&s;e a peculia|rity
<PB N="141" REF="154">
that was very &s;ingular: under their hair, which was in general &s;hort and bu&s;hy, they thought they perceived &s;omething uncommon about their ears; and, upon examination, they found them of an a&s;toni&s;hing length, but &s;o nicely wrapt up, by means of the gri&s;tles be|ing taken out, that they appeared rather like &s;mall flatted chitterlings than ears; yet when they came to be unfolded, our journali&s;t &s;ays he mea&s;ured one of them full five inches and a half long. Their hou&s;es, or rather huts, were very mean, and covered all over, except a &s;mall hole to creep in at, which &s;erved them for door, window, and chimney. They were the greate&s;t thieves they met with in their whole voyage; and it was found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hoot one thief to pre&s;erve the lives of many others. Indeed the people were ready enough to &s;hoot them, a common &s;ailor no more regarding the life of one of tho&s;e poor creatures who had filched from him a nail, than a countryman would regard the life of a fox that was rob|bing his hen-roo&s;t.&mdash;When the Re&s;olution ar|rived at this i&s;land &s;he was principally in want of water; but of water the i&s;land was in want too. They dug a well, but that afforded only a bracki&s;h bad-ta&s;ted &s;upply, &s;uch as they met with at the i&s;lands of Middleburgh and Am|&s;terdam; nor when they had ranged the i&s;land through could they meet with any better; yet the natives did not &s;eem to regret the want of

authentic, and in many particulars the three accounts agree and &s;erve to confirm each other.</P>
<P>Don Felipe Gonzalez arrived on the 16th of November 1770, in the frigate La Ro&s;alia at this i&s;land, of which he gives the following de|&s;cription: "That it is &s;ituated in the latitude of 27 deg. 6 min. South, and in longitude 268 deg. 19 min. Ea&s;t from Teneriff, an&s;wer|ing to 108 deg. 8 min. We&s;t from London, nearly in the &s;ame latitude and longitude in which our navigators found it. Whether they had ever &s;een this Spani&s;h account is uncer|tain, as it could not have been known in Eu|rope before the beginning of the year 1772, and they &s;ailed in July 1772: but be that as it may, the Spani&s;h de&s;cription of its &s;ituation and &s;ize is remarkably corre&s;pondent with that of our journali&s;t. Its &s;ize, &s;ays Gonzalez, is about 12 or 14 leagues in circumference, and it is rather low than high. The inhabitants of both &s;exes are about 3000 in number. They are a people of a docile di&s;po&s;ition, but great thieves. The men have thick beards, are tall, and well made, white and red. They keep the fire under ground, and appear to have &s;ome &s;uper&s;tition in taking it out. This was ob&s;erv|ed when any of our people wanted to light their tobacco.</P>
<P>They have no other arms but &s;ticks and &s;tones, and have much dread of artillery.
<PB N="145" REF="156">
They are very proud of every thing red, and &s;light every other colour; except white. The men go naked, all but a broad girdle curiou&s;ly wrought, which they tie about their wai&s;ts in a very decent manner. The&s;e girdles are wove like netting, of a material that looks like cot|ton, of which they make very beautiful cover-lids.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are under ground, with a very narrow entrance; and there are be&s;ides &s;ome huts made of reeds in the like form.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is very rocky, and we &s;aw no trees but a few figs, cotton, and &s;hrubs. Their food is white pumpkins, plantains, &s;weet-pota|toes, yams, and other roots of the like kind. There are many &s;prings of <HI>good water,</HI> and &s;ome of bad. We &s;aw no birds, but &s;ome fowls like tho&s;e of Europe; and when the natives want to dre&s;s them, they put hot &s;tones into their bellies till they are fit to be eaten. On the &s;ea coa&s;t there are not many fi&s;h; there are only &s;ome anchovies and &s;mall fi&s;h.</P>
<P>They have many &s;tatues of a mon&s;trous &s;ize: they are of one piece of &s;tone, and of a gigantic figure; for they are &s;ome of them more than 20 cubits high, and others not a fourth part &s;o high, near which are their bu|rying places.</P>
<P>The i&s;land has no port, only a little cove for a long-boat, or &s;mall ve&s;&s;el. The greate&s;t
<PB N="146" REF="157">
length is about &s;ix leagues. It lies Ea&s;t and We&s;t; and it was at the We&s;t end that we rai&s;ed three cro&s;&s;es upon three &s;imilar little hills, te&s;tifying by the&s;e marks that we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of the King; and, in honour of his Maje&s;ty, we named it St. Car|los.</P>
<P>There is no good anchoring place all round the i&s;land, the bottom being exce&s;&s;ively bad, as we had two cables cut in le&s;s than forty-eight hours. We only remained five days on &s;hore; at the expiration of which we went in que&s;t of other lands, &s;aid to be &s;ituated in the latitude of 38 deg. S. but could find none.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, the Spani&s;h voyager adds, is 600 leagues from Callao, and nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance from the main land of Chili. He calls it <HI>David's I&s;land,</HI> taking it for <HI>Davis's Land,</HI> as marked in the maps; and, <HI>probably,</HI> it is the &s;ame, as no other land has ever been di&s;covered by any other navigator near the meridian where Davis's Land has obtained a place.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly related what peculiari|ties Don Gonzalez ob&s;erved in his five days &s;tay, we &s;hall in the &s;ame conci&s;e manner run over Roggewein's account, and then re&s;ume the thread of our narrative.</P>
<P>On the Dutch &s;hips [of which there were three] approaching the land, an Indian came
<PB N="147" REF="158">
on board the Admiral, who was of a brown complexion, pretty tall, &s;trong, and of a bri&s;k, gay, lively countenance. He was naked, and his body painted in various figures: his ears were extremely long, and hung down to his &s;houlders. They gave him cloth to cover him|&s;elf; and they gave him meat to eat, and of|fered him wine to drink; but he threw it in his eyes. The mu&s;icians played him a con|cert; the &s;ailors danced to the mu&s;ic, and he danced with them. They clothed him, and &s;ent him a&s;hore; but they afterwards &s;hot him, as they &s;ay, by accident.&mdash;They brought fowls, and plenty of roots; and the Indian who fir&s;t came on board pre&s;ented the Admiral with fowls ready dre&s;&s;ed, in their manner. There was one among them quite <HI>white,</HI> [&s;uch a one as was &s;een at Otaheite] and they judged by the &s;olemnity of his air that he was a prie&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day they landed 150 men, at the head of whom was the Admiral. The people flock|ed about them by thou&s;ands; &s;ome running to and fro like frantics, and others pro&s;trating them&s;elves before their idols in the attitude of prayer.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of them pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e, and ventur|ed to touch the arms of the &s;trangers, they fired upon them, and the friendly Indian was among tho&s;e who fell. Their cries and lamen|tations were dreadful; and they be&s;ought the
<PB N="148" REF="159">
murderers by every attitude of humility to &s;uf|fer them to carry off their dead. Affected with all the&s;e demon&s;trations of humility, the&s;e chri&s;tian plunderers vouchafed to do them no harm. Being made to under&s;tand that their fury was abated, and that they were di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip, the poor creatures brought them fowls and fruits, and whatever their i&s;land af|forded, in the greate&s;t abundance. They &s;aw no animals on the i&s;land, but birds of various kinds. Their huts were from forty to &s;ixty feet in length, and about &s;ix or eight in breadth, &s;upported by poles, and covered with leaves. Each family had a hou&s;e, and each hou&s;e had an inclo&s;ure &s;eparated from every other enclo|&s;ure, and formed by a line. The country ap|peared to be all cultivated, and when Rogge|wein was there the fruits of the earth, on which alone the natives appeared to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, were all in maturity.</P>
<P>Their women were cloathed with coverlids, and painted with a rouge &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the bright|ne&s;s of any thing of the kind known in Europe. They were not in the lea&s;t coy, but would by their ge&s;tures invite to familiarities, to which the common men were not aver&s;e. The men of the i&s;land had no arms, at lea&s;t they made u&s;e of none: When they were attacked they fled to their idols, of which there are many up and down the coa&s;t. They repre&s;ent the figure
<PB N="149" REF="160">
of a man with great ears, the head adorned with a crown, and the whole executed and pro|portioned according to the rules of art; around the&s;e idols are circles built of white &s;tones, and they ob&s;erved that the idols were more fre|quently vi&s;ited by &s;ome than by others; and they ob&s;erved likewi&s;e that tho&s;e who attended them mo&s;t had marks of di&s;tinction, by which they concluded they were prie&s;ts. The&s;e marks were large bobs hanging at their ears, a bon|net made of black and white feathers, and their heads &s;haven quite bare.</P>
<P>Bougainville has remarked that the prie&s;t in the Straits, when he went to work upon the Indian boy that had poi&s;oned him&s;elf by &s;wal|lowing &s;ome fragments of &s;hining-gla&s;s, put on a Mercury's cap made of feathers, in order to drive away the evil &s;pirit that he thought had po&s;&s;e&s;t him. <HI>See Voyages of Engli&s;h Navigators round the World.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not, however, be forgotten, that the idols of this i&s;land are not in this voyage &s;aid to be of &s;uch a mon&s;trous height as the Spa|ni&s;h writer has a&s;cribed to them. The height of three men is the utmo&s;t proportion given to the large&s;t of them; the ordinary deities are &s;aid not to exceed the height of one. Our jour|nali&s;t &s;ays that &s;ome of the&s;e idols are carved in the form of mens heads, one over another.</P>

<P>At half pa&s;t four in the morning the &s;hip brought to, and ca&s;t anchor in 30 fathom water; fine white &s;and. Several canoes came from the &s;hore along&s;ide the &s;hip; but none of the natives would venture on board. They brought as a pre&s;ent to the Captain &s;ome bread-fruit, and a hog; and were very ready to exchange whatever they had about them for any trifles that were offered them. We know of no voyagers that have vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands before &s;ince their fir&s;t di&s;covery: their wonder was therefore the greater, as hardly any tradition could remain of the former European vi&s;itors, after &s;o many years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the Spa|niards had made them feel the fatal effects of fire-arms. It is not ea&s;y to determine whether they were plea&s;ed or terrified at the approach of the &s;hip, nor whether they intended to re|ceive their vi&s;itors ho&s;pitably, or were concert|ing means to get them in their power to cut them off. Tho&s;e, however, who came along|&s;ide made a &s;trange noi&s;e as they rowed a&s;hore, and that noi&s;e continued the whole &s;ucceeding night, during which they kept fires burning on the tops of the hills, probably by way of bea|cons
<PB N="155" REF="168">
to alarm the country of &s;ome approach|ing danger, or uncommon event.</P>
<P>8. The Indians, whatever their private in|tentions might be, continued to carry a fair ap|pearance. Early in the morning they brought bread-fruit, which they exchanged for nails, bits of broken china-ware, white paper, or, in &s;hort, for any thing that was &s;hewn them. About &s;ix great numbers of them pre&s;ented them&s;elves on the &s;hore, and &s;eemed to ex|pre&s;s much rejoicing, by &s;houting, dancing, leaping, and running; and in a very &s;hort time after, five or &s;ix of them came clo&s;e to the &s;hip's &s;ide; and &s;igns were made to them to come on board, which they either did not, or would not under&s;tand; but one of them pre|&s;ently un&s;hipped the &s;ide iron &s;tantion, and dived with it into the &s;ea. All po&s;&s;ible means were u&s;ed to per&s;uade him to bring it back, but in vain; and, when at &s;ome di&s;tance, he ro&s;e and got into a canoe. They were deter|mined he &s;hould not avail him&s;elf of the rob|bery, left by &s;uffering him to e&s;cape, others might be encouraged to attempt the like ex|ploits: orders were therefore given to fire while he was yet within reach, and it fortu|nately happened that he was &s;hot dead, with|out any of his companions being hurt. There happened to be two men in the canoe; one of whom, on &s;eeing what had happened, threw
<PB N="156" REF="169">
the &s;tauntion overborad, and then threw him|&s;elf after it: the other kept baleing the blood and water out of the canoe, while the pinnace which had been launched for carrying the Captain and his company on &s;hore came along&s;ide, to take a view of the man that was killed. The death of this man &s;eemed to &s;trike the whole body of the Indians with fear and con&s;ternation. Tho&s;e who were at &s;ea made rapidly for land; and tho&s;e who were dancing on the &s;hore fled precipitately to the hills at a di&s;tance, where they howled, and made many frantic motions for more than an hour: and in the mean time &s;ome of the mo&s;t daring among them attempted to cut the ropes, and carry off the &s;hip's buoy; which being ob&s;erv|ed, one of the great guns loaded with grape|&s;hot was fired among&s;t them, which &s;oon put an end to their enterprize. Being now, to all appearance, convinced of their own inability to re&s;i&s;t, they quietly acquie&s;ced in furni&s;hing whatever was demanded of them. They brought hogs, but &s;paringly, as having perhaps no great &s;tock upon the i&s;land; but of &s;uch fruit as the i&s;land produced, they brought abun|dance. The Captain and the other gentlemen went a&s;hore in the pinnace, and landed with|out oppo&s;ition. But, previou&s;ly to their em|barkation, there came a canoe to the &s;hip in which was a me&s;&s;enger, who held in his hand
<PB N="157" REF="170">
a green bough with a white flag fa&s;tened to it, which he pre&s;ented to the Captain, with &s;ix &s;mall hogs. The&s;e the Captain received, plac|ing the bough with the flag at the gang-way of the &s;hip, at the &s;ame time di&s;playing another white flag &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly at the ma&s;t head, that the inhabitants might &s;ee it at a great di&s;|tance from the hills on the land. Peace be|ing in this manner concluded, all farther ho&s;|tilities cea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The gentlemen were permitted to range the i&s;land without in|terruption. The waterers found water in great plenty, and very good; in&s;omuch, that what remained of the water taken in at Ea&s;ter I&s;land was all bilged, and thrown into the &s;ea. The i&s;land which the Captain made choice of to ca&s;t anchor, appears to be the &s;ame to which the Spaniards gave the name of Dominica. Our journali&s;t de&s;cribes it as lying E. by. N. and W. by S. and Quiros as lying N. E. and S. W. a difference not very con&s;iderable where exactne&s;s was not much regarded on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, particularly the men, for very few of the women made their appearance, were rather of the large&s;t &s;ize: they were &s;trong, active, and well &s;haped; and were in general more elegantly painted than any they had yet met with, even more &s;o than the New-Zealanders, having their very lips tattowed;
<PB N="158" REF="171">
and the figures on their faces and brea&s;ts &s;o curiou&s;ly traced and delineated, that no pain|ter in Europe could have &s;ketch'd the outline of a bird, fi&s;h, or animal, with more nicety, or with greater exactne&s;s. It was &s;omewhat remarkable, that among them there were many with the lo&s;s of their left eye.</P>
<P>When the pinnace returned the Captain brought with him &s;ix hogs, a con&s;iderable quantity of bread-fruit, and &s;ome plantains. They &s;aw no cocoa-nut trees growing upon the i&s;land; but cocoa-nut trees there certain|ly were, as the inhabitants brought &s;ome to &s;ell as &s;oon as the cour&s;e of trade was placed in a regular channel. The men were in gene|ral naked, except a thin covering round the wai&s;t. The women were covered from head to foot with a &s;ort of white cloth, not unlike the Otaheite cloth in fabric, but not &s;o fine. Few of them appeared; and tho&s;e who did appear were far from being hand&s;ome. Qui|ros, however, has given a very different ac|count. He &s;ays, that very fine women were &s;een there, but acknowledges he did not &s;ee any of them him&s;elf, which &s;eems to confirm what our journali&s;t has ob&s;erved, that few of them appear: but per&s;ons of rank who did &s;ee them a&s;&s;ured Quiros, that they were as beautiful as tho&s;e of Lima; and there are (&s;ays he) very beautiful women at Lime. Their countenances
<PB N="159" REF="172">
were plea&s;ant, they had delicate hands, genteel body and wai&s;t, exceeding much in perfection the mo&s;t beautiful ladies of Lima; they were &s;ufficiently white, but not &s;o ro&s;y; they were clad from the wai&s;t downwards with a &s;ort of tunicks, artfully woven of the fine&s;t palm. The only arms our journali&s;t &s;aw among the&s;e i&s;landers, were javelins, which they threw with great dexterity and force, and &s;lings, with which they fling &s;tones to an incredible di&s;|tance; their mu&s;ical in&s;truments are drums and conchs.</P>
<P>9. On &s;ome affront offered by the &s;ailors to their women, word was brought that the na|tives were all retired to the mountains, tak|ing their women and children along with them. This cau&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s, as all trade was now at an end, and nothing to be procured but water. Some per&s;ons, however, were de|puted to make up the breach, who carried pre|&s;ents with them of &s;uch things as it was thought would be mo&s;t acceptable. The gentlemen, who were appointed to execute this commi&s;|&s;ion, &s;o effectually brought about a reconcilia|tion, that they returned loaded with fruit. It was, however, thought advi&s;eable to be al|ways upon the watch. In con&s;equence where|of a party of marines was placed as a guard to protect the waterers from in&s;ult, while they were employed in filling water. This was
<PB N="160" REF="173">
a principal bu&s;ine&s;s, to which the greate&s;t at|tention was every day paid.</P>
<P>The captain and gentlemen who accompa|nied him, having &s;ufficiently reconnoitred the country adjoining to the bay where the &s;hip rode at anchor, embraced the opportunity, while the crew were all bu&s;y, to vi&s;it a bay at &s;ome di&s;tance to the &s;outhward, in order to learn what that part of the country would pro|duce, and to endeavour to extend the trade for hogs, cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. This ex|cur&s;ion was attended with very good effects; they found the natives very amicably di&s;po&s;ed, and very ready to bring to market whatever the country produced. Here the captain pur|cha&s;ed eighteen hogs, a large quantity of bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and plantains, and returned again about &s;even in the evening. In this bay, where the natives were not alarmed by the brutality of the common men, the women were not afraid to be &s;een; nor was the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t perceivable on either &s;ide. The na|tives brought down their hogs and fruit to the &s;hore, and the per&s;on appointed to be purveyor &s;hewed the articles he had to exchange, and the natives were le&s;t at full liberty to chu&s;e, each what he liked be&s;t; the purveyor fixed the value. The articles they &s;eemed mo&s;t to admire were picture cards, pieces of Chine&s;e paper, and kind of China ware, or any thing
<PB N="161" REF="174">
made of gla&s;s, nails, and bits of red cloth. For trifles of this kind they readily exchanged their hogs and fruit. The news of this hone&s;t dealing having &s;pread over the i&s;land, and reached the adjoining i&s;les, the &s;hip was next day &s;urrounded with more than fifty canoes, loaded with provi&s;ions of various kinds, among which was a fruit which &s;eemed peculiar to the&s;e I&s;lands: It is thus de&s;cribed by Thevenot,&mdash;it is about the &s;ize of an ordinary melon, and is not unlike &s;ome generae of that fruit in &s;hape; it grows upon trees, and when grow|ing is of a deep green, but when ripe is of a fine delicate poli&s;hed green, though the out|&s;ide appears rough and jagged, with cro&s;s rays not unlike the pine apple. The figure is not quite round, but &s;omewhat narrower at the point than at the &s;talk, from whence grows a core that reaches to the middle, and within this core is a web; it has no &s;tone or kernel, nor any thing u&s;ele&s;s except the out&s;ide, and that is very thin; the re&s;t is all eatable, and makes but one ma&s;s, which is very delicious, nouri&s;hing, and whole&s;ome. The people who brought this fruit were very civil and courte|ous; they had their hair dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ingular manner, being parted and tied up in two knots behind not unlike the wigs formerly worn by gen|tlemen of di&s;tinction, and now only by coun&s;el|lors at the bar. Their beards too were &s;horn in a
<PB N="162" REF="175">
peculiar manner, and tied underneath their chins. This manner of tying the hair did not however appear to be intended as a mark to di&s;tingui&s;h one cla&s;s of people from another, but was only a variety or fa&s;hion which every one might or might not follow as he plea&s;ed. But there was one thing particular, and which &s;eemed to be univer&s;al among the males; and that was, the prepuce was tied back in &s;uch a manner as to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of circum|ci&s;ion, without being circumci&s;ed. Among the tropical i&s;landers, with who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms our late di&s;coverers have made us ac|quainted, the free indulgence of the women is a leading character; but in the&s;e i&s;lands the re|ver&s;e of that character &s;eems to be the fact. In the Society and all the neighbouring i&s;les, the women make not the lea&s;t &s;cruple of expo&s;e|ing them&s;elves in the mo&s;t la&s;civious manner to the view of the European &s;trangers; but here they held indelicacy in the utmo&s;t abhor|rence; and it &s;hould &s;eem that a frolick&s;ome attempt of a &s;ailor had driven the women and children of a whole di&s;trict out of the reach of &s;uch another in&s;ult; yet where they were in no danger of affronts of the like kind, they were in no fear of &s;hewing them&s;elves. Thus we may remark the different di&s;po&s;itions of man|kind di&s;per&s;ed all over the world, influenced it &s;eems by no climate, but directed at fir&s;t by
<PB N="163" REF="176">
&s;ome &s;uperintending power, and afterwards conducted by the ruling pa&s;&s;ions, and con|firmed by habit.</P>
<P>Our journali&s;t &s;aw none of their hou&s;es but from the &s;hip; they appeared to be &s;mall and contemptible little huts, covered with platted leaves, and &s;upported by the trunks of trees. Indeed the inhabitants &s;o near the line require no large or pompous buildings to defend them from the weather. Shade and coolne&s;s, and a &s;lender covering from the dews and little rain that falls in that delightful climate, are all that nature requires; and where &s;plendour is not the object, there will be no emulation. The only ambition di&s;coverable among the&s;e people was in dre&s;&s;ing their hair, and orna|menting their heads; &s;everal of them had caps very curiou&s;ly wrought in &s;hapes not inele|gant, and compo&s;ed of feathers of various colours inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;pangles of mother of pearl, that looked very gay and were very becoming. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous mark of di&s;tinction appeared to be tattowing. In this the difference was very di&s;cernable. The chiefs were tattowed from their faces to their fingers ends, not in volutes or &s;piral lines like the chiefs in New Zealand; but in figures of various kinds, &s;uited to the different parts of the body, according to the arti&s;t's fancy, in which no &s;mall ingenuity was di&s;played. Per|haps
<PB N="164" REF="177">
the different qualities of tho&s;e chiefs might have been di&s;covered by ob&s;erving the characters repre&s;ented; but time was wanting for &s;uch nice ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Quiros, the Spani&s;h voyager, who gave the fir&s;t account of the&s;e people, &s;ays, they are white and of a gentle di&s;po&s;ition, large and &s;tout limbed, and &s;o well &s;haped as greatly to &s;urpa&s;s the Spaniards; that they had beautiful teeth, eyes, and features, and among them were &s;ome of the hand&s;ome&s;t boys with flow|ing hair he had ever beheld; that all of them were naked; that their bodies, legs, and arms, were painted; and that &s;ome had their faces painted; that mo&s;t of the Spaniards ap|peared of low &s;tature compared to the men; and that among them was one taller and &s;touter than any per&s;on in the Spani&s;h fleet; that being encouraged to come on board, a|bout forty of them entered the Admiral's &s;hip at once, and became &s;o trouble&s;ome that his Excellency was obliged to give orders to fire upon them, by which five or &s;ix of them were &s;hot dead; that on this unexpected &s;alute they fled to &s;hore, threatening vengeance by bran|di&s;hing their lances; that they &s;oon returned, and began an attack by throwing &s;tones from &s;lings at an incredible di&s;tance; but their chief being &s;hot through the head by a bullet, and &s;even or eight of his followers being likewi&s;e

killed, and many more wounded, the re&s;t thought fit to make a precipitate retreat, and pre&s;ently after retired to the mountains with their women and children; that then the Ad|miral with his lady and family landed; that he ordered ma&s;s to be &s;aid by his chaplain on &s;hore, at which &s;ome antient Indians who &s;till remained in their hou&s;es attended, and be|haved with decency, kneeling when the Spa|niards kneeled, and bowing when they bowed; that after &s;ome time, while the Spaniards were employed to take in wood and water, the natives came down in &s;traggling parties, and &s;hewed a de&s;ire of being reconciled, bringing with them pre&s;ents of fruit, and &s;ome fowls: the&s;e were kindly received, and by degrees a friendly intercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which continued during the whole time the Admiral with his retinue remained on &s;hore; but he was &s;carce &s;ettled on board when the old quar|rel was revived. The Spaniards were again attacked with lances and &s;tones, and the na|tives were again driven to the woods and the mountains.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es, Quiros ob&s;erves, are built upon po&s;ts, and the floors are a &s;tory higher than the &s;treets, and many people appeared to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e. At a di&s;tance from the town which we vi&s;ited, &s;ays he, there &s;tood a temple &s;urrounded with palli&s;ades,
<PB N="166" REF="179">
with the entrance to the We&s;t, and a hou&s;e almo&s;t in the middle with the door to the North, in which were &s;ome figures of wood, ill wrought; and there were offerings of eat|ables, among which was a hog; of this the &s;oldiers made prize, and were about to carry off other things, but were prevented by the natives, who were highly enraged at the vio|lence which had been done to their holy offer|ings. He ob&s;erves, that in the mornings and evenings all with one voice made a &s;onorous and harmonious chanting, and at length &s;hewed an inclination to do mi&s;chief, probably for the violence offered to their place of wor|&s;hip. One, however, who appeared to be more civilized than the re&s;t, &s;eemed to take a great liking to the chaplain on board, who was not le&s;s fond of the Indian than the In|dian was of him, and took great plea&s;ure in a&s;king him que&s;tions about the mo&s;t obvious objects in view; particularly by what names they called the heavens, earth, &s;un, moon, &s;tars, and the like. To which he gave an&s;wers which left no room to doubt that he perfectly under&s;tood the que&s;tions that were a&s;ked him.</P>
<P>Being invited on board, the fir&s;t thing that attracted his notice was the cattle and other animals that he &s;aw upon deck; at which he &s;eemed to expre&s;s his &s;urprize, e&s;pecially at
<PB N="167" REF="180">
the cows and &s;heep. He al&s;o was very curi|ous in viewing the con&s;truction of the &s;hip, her ma&s;ts, her rigging, her ornaments, and the many conveniences with which &s;he was fur|ni&s;hed; and he noted every thing that was &s;hewn him with more than Indian attention. The chaplain offered him &s;weetmeats and wine, but he would ta&s;te of neither; but &s;eeing the &s;hips weighing anchor, he pre&s;&s;ed to be &s;et a&s;hore; and when he was landed rejoiced ex|ceedingly. Such is the only account we had of the&s;e i&s;landers before Capt. Cooke touched upon their coa&s;t, who having &s;upplied the &s;hip with wood and water, and with what other ne|ce&s;&s;aries the i&s;land produced; and having &s;ur|veyed the bays, while Mr. Fo&s;ter and his a&s;&s;o|ciates were taking a view of the land, on the 11th he gave orders for getting all things in readine&s;s to &s;ail; and about four the &s;ame af|ternoon they weighed anchor and came to &s;ea, tacking every hour to clear the &s;traits between the i&s;lands, they being &s;ituated in re&s;pect to each other nearly in a &s;quare, which made the navigation both difficult and dangerous.</P>
<P>April 12. The morning plea&s;ant, a mild breeze attended with gentle &s;howers, and the &s;ea open. About ten the &s;hip &s;pread all her canvas, and proceeded at a moderate rate, directing her cour&s;e to the S. S. W. with the wind at E. S. E.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="181">13. The weather continuing plea&s;ant, with now and then gentle &s;howers, and &s;ome light|ening, great attention was paid to airing the &s;hip, and keeping all things clean. At this time not a man was &s;ick on board. Latitude at noon by ob&s;ervation 10 deg. 57&frac12; min. Wind at E. by S. Cour&s;e as before.

At ten the man at the ma&s;t head called out Land, bearing about We&s;t. This land had been &s;een by Commodore Byron, in the Dol|phin's fir&s;t Voyage round the World; it is very exten&s;ive, and appears at a great di&s;tance, like an a&s;&s;emblage of many &s;mall i&s;les, full of trees. Mr. Byron clalled it George's-I&s;land. Lat. at noon 214 deg. 26&frac12; min. At noon they were at the N. W. &s;ide of it, and about one in the afternoon hoi&s;ted the large cutter out and &s;ent her in &s;hore to &s;ound. At half pa&s;t two hoi&s;ted the pinnace out; and the large cutter came on board. The pinnace and cutter went on &s;hore, well armed, with the fir&s;t and third lieutenants, and other gentlemen, to recon|noitre the coa&s;t; the natives came from the other &s;ide of a lagoon that &s;eemed to part the i&s;land, arm'd in large canoes; &s;ome of them brought one cocoa-nut in their hands, but would &s;carce trade at all; they wanted every thing they &s;aw without making a return. They were in general furni&s;hed with long &s;pears and lances, pointed with &s;ting-ray tail-bones. They made a hideous noi&s;e among them&s;elves, and &s;ome were for &s;eizing the people's mu&s;quets, while others took to the bu&s;hes, and arming them|&s;elves with &s;pears, advanced towards the boats. The gentlemen, unwilling to proceed to extre|mities, put off, and brought the captain an account of their inho&s;pitable behaviour. The
<PB N="170" REF="183">
captain ordered the guns to be loaded with round &s;hot, and to be fired ju&s;t over the point where they were a&s;&s;embled; two of the &s;hot went through the trees, and they could per|ceive from the &s;hip one large cocoa-nut tree fall; other two went right through the place where the natives were po&s;ted, in a direction paral|lel with the horizon. They could hear them &s;cream and make a fearful noi&s;e. After being in this manner intimidated, without which nothing can be done with the&s;e people, they brought in their boats 27 cocoa-nuts, and 6 dogs; the dogs were in general &s;mall and thick, with a large head, not unlike that of our bull dogs. The&s;e Indians were in general &s;tour made men, tall, and well proportioned; and the women alto|gether as ordinary. They had no cloathing, ex|cept a piece of white netting about their wai&s;ts, but they were copiou&s;ly marked about the brea&s;t and arms with fi&s;hes and other &s;ea ani|mals. They were the mo&s;t &s;avage looking &s;et of people, our journali&s;t &s;ays, he had &s;een throughout the voyage, and were of a colour nearly approaching to black; they had black hair, tyed by &s;ome on the back part, and by others on the top of their heads; none of them were painted. Their hou&s;es were like dog|kennels, about the length and breadth of a man, and not two feet high, thatched with co|coa-nut leaves; they &s;poke quite quick, and
<PB N="171" REF="184">
eat their words, as the &s;ea-faring phra&s;e is, like the New Guinea negroes.</P>
<P>Commodore Byron, who fir&s;t gave name to this i&s;land, found the inhabitants equally inho&s;pitable, and equally inclined to mi&s;chief. In a &s;kirmi&s;h which his people had with a &s;trong party of them, they killed three, and wounded &s;everal more, on which the whole body, men, women, and children, fled to the woods and mountains, and were not more &s;een. On the Tamar's boats fir&s;t approaching the &s;hore, one of the natives got into her, and in the twinkling of an eye &s;eized a &s;eaman's jacket, and jumping over-board with it never once appeared above water till he was clo&s;e in &s;hore, and mingled with the re&s;t of his companions; another of them got hold of a mid&s;hipman's hat, but not knowing how to take it off, in&s;tead of lifting it up pulled it down, &s;o that the owner had time to prevent its being taken away. In the ferocity of the natives the Commodore's relation agrees with that of our journali&s;t, and &s;o it does in the meanne&s;s of their hovels, but adds that they are delightfully &s;ituated.</P>
<P>It appears, however, that though Commo|dore Byron gave name to this i&s;land, the Dol|phin and Tamar were not the fir&s;t European &s;hips that had vi&s;ited it; for it will hardly be conte&s;ted, after what has been &s;aid by the
<PB N="172" REF="185">
editor of the Hi&s;torical Account of all the Voyages round the World performed by Eng|li&s;h Navigators, that it was here the African galley, one of Ta&s;man's &s;quadron, was &s;hip|wrecked, and that part of the crew fell vic|tims to the rage of the&s;e barbarians; but it is by no means clear that the inhabitants, though ferocious, are man-eaters; on the contrary, the pre&s;umption is rather again&s;t that notion, as the writer of the Commodore's Voyage &s;eems to think that the cocoa-nut trees furni&s;h them with food, and almo&s;t all the other nece&s;&s;aries fo life. Dogs, however, it is almo&s;t certain, make a part of their luxu|ries; for our journali&s;t takes notice, after a number of them had been &s;lain, that dogs were brought as peace-offerings, to appea&s;e the wrath of their murderers, which they would not have done, had they not thought them delicacies; he further ob&s;erves, that every native had his dog; and when the hou&s;es were de&s;erted, the dogs remained and made a mo&s;t terrific noi&s;e in the night by their howl|ing. From &s;everal circum&s;tances, Commo|dore Byron was of opinion, that a profitable pearl-fi&s;hery might be e&s;tabli&s;hed on this and the adjacent i&s;lands of which we are giving an account; but later di&s;coveries have &s;hewn, that pearls are as rare in them as in Europe; none of any con&s;iderable &s;ize or remarkable
<PB N="173" REF="186">
beauty having been yet found on any of them. Good water, &s;curvy gra&s;s, and plenty of co|coa-nuts were however found here, of which the <HI>hone&s;t Engli&s;hmen</HI> made no &s;cruple to load their boats, though they had before &s;hot a number of the natives for carrying away a jacket.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, and perhaps with ju&s;tice, that the ve&s;&s;els for navigation in every country di&s;play the utmo&s;t efforts of genius of which the inhabitants are capable in their con&s;truction; and that by the formation of them the ingenuity of a people may be e&s;ti|mated. If this ob&s;ervation is admitted, the people of George's i&s;land will not be thought de&s;titute of invention. Their canoes, &s;ays Commodore Byron, are of very curious con|&s;truction, and mu&s;t co&s;t them infinite labour. They con&s;i&s;t of planks exceedingly well wrought, and in many places adorned with carving; the&s;e planks are &s;ewed together, and over every &s;eam there is a &s;trip of tortoi&s;e|&s;hell, very artificially inlaid to keep out the water. Their bottoms are &s;harp as a wedge, and the whole body is very narrow; and therefore two of them are generally joined together by a couple of cro&s;s &s;pars, &s;o that a &s;pace from &s;ix to eight feet is left open be|tween them. Thus united, a ma&s;t is hoi&s;ted in each of them, and a &s;ail &s;pread between
<PB N="174" REF="187">
the ma&s;ts. This &s;ail is made of matting mo&s;t curiou&s;ly woven, and their cordage, though made of the outer bark of the cocoa nut, is admirable. Such is the nature, and &s;uch the art of the people of this remote i&s;land.</P>
<P>Our voyagers, having availed them&s;elves all they could of the produce of the i&s;land, and gratified their curio&s;ity in vi&s;iting their places of wor&s;hip, and the repo&s;itories of their dead, about &s;ix in the evening the pinnace and large cutter were hoi&s;ted in, and there being no anchorage the &s;hip lay off and on all night.</P>
<P>18. A fre&s;h breeze from the ea&s;tward &s;pringing up, at five in the morning bore away, and made &s;ail to the S. S. W. and came in &s;ight of another fine plea&s;ant i&s;land, and &s;teered S. S. W. along &s;hore, but did not land; though here the Dolphin and Tamar found the inhabitants much more ho&s;pitable than in the great i&s;land. Lat. at noon by ob&s;ervation 14 deg. 33 min. Saw great numbers of birds and &s;everal fi&s;h. At eight hauled up to the S. S. E. Wind at Ea&s;t. At twelve tacked and &s;tood to the N. N. E. it being hazardous to proceed, the moon being down.</P>
<P>19. A plea&s;ant breeze from the ea&s;tward. At three &s;tood to the S. S. E. At five bore away S. W. by S. Wind at E. S. E. At half pa&s;t &s;even &s;aw land, bearing We&s;t, a low i&s;land, extending to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. At ten
<PB N="175" REF="188">
came in &s;ight of another i&s;land, bearing S. S. E. Ship's cour&s;e S. W. At eleven bore away W. S. W. At one perceived a reef to run as far as we could &s;ee, con&s;i&s;ting of a chain of &s;mall i&s;lands, from a quarter of a mile to one mile and a half from each other: the&s;e little &s;pots abounded with cocoa-nut trees, and the reefs of rocks which divided them were at times dry; &s;o that in general they could be reckoned nothing el&s;e but one continued chain of i&s;lands. The &s;ailors imagined there were turtle about them, as they &s;aw the natives bu&s;y on many of tho&s;e reefs.&mdash;About three leagues to the &s;outhward, or S. S. W. of this range of i&s;les, they could plainly perceive &s;everal other i&s;lands that &s;eemed to be larger than the&s;e, and chained together in the &s;ame manner. I&s;lands, and chains of i&s;lands, continued to pre&s;ent them&s;elves almo&s;t hourly, without any other material occurrence happening till the 21&s;t, when they made George's I&s;land, bearing S. S. W. (the &s;outh part.) At half pa&s;t eleven &s;teered W. Lat. noon 16 deg. 50 min. At one &s;teered W. half S.&mdash;At &s;ix &s;hortened &s;ail, being about three leagues from the land, hauled up to the northward, and lay off and on all night.</P>
<P>22. At nine brought to in Mattavey-bay, and the re&s;t of the day employed in mooring the &s;hip, furling the &s;ails, and getting the tents
<PB N="176" REF="189">
and other requi&s;ites on &s;hore. All this day great numbers of the natives thronged about the &s;hip, to expre&s;s their joy on the arrival of their old friends; among whom the girls were no &s;mall part of the company. It was now remarked, that the Otaheite girls were no le&s;s artful than the London mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; each was anxious to know what pre&s;ents their lovers had brought them, where they had been, what curio&s;ities they had met with, and no favours were now to be expected till the che&s;t was opened, and they complimented with what they liked be&s;t. The freedoms that had been granted formerly were all forgotten, and new kindne&s;&s;es were to be purcha&s;ed with new va|luables. Some indeed there were among them who expre&s;&s;ed a real affection for the men they loved, but the&s;e were rare; for mo&s;t of them cho&s;e to attach them&s;elves to new admirers, by whom they expected to be more liberally re|warded than by their old mates. They were not now as formerly to be gratified with a nail; but in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;omething equivalent in va|lue to what would content a London mi&s;tre&s;s, and <HI>no pence, no pater-no&s;ter.</HI> It is a fact that &s;ome of the &s;ailors &s;quandered all they had, and all they could get credit for, upon them. Such are the mercenary tempers of the ladies of plea&s;ure all over the world.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="190">23. All hands were employed in prepara|tions for refitting the &s;hip; and the armourer's forge being put up, &s;ome of the men were eager to make u&s;e of it for their own private advantage before it was &s;et to work for the repairs of the &s;hip; but being di&s;covered, were &s;everely puni&s;hed; and, not only he who u&s;ed it, but he who &s;uffered it to be u&s;ed, was equally &s;entenced to receive twelve la&s;hes.</P>
<P>24. The bu&s;ine&s;s to be done being &s;ettled, that part of the crew who were unemployed had leave to go on &s;hore; and &s;o alternately; and as two-thirds were fully &s;ufficient to be on duty at a time, the other third were allowed to go on &s;hore at a time; &s;o that none had rea&s;on to complain but tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the rules. This day king Portotow with &s;everal of his nobles and great men came to pay their com|pliments to the Captain, and to make the u&s;ual pre&s;ents on his arrival. The&s;e pre&s;ents are always tendered as a free gift; but if a return is not made in the &s;ame way of more than the value, the giver con&s;iders it as an affront, and generally &s;ome inconvenience is ob&s;erved to follow. The king with his retinue came in double canoes, &s;uch as were &s;een by our voya|agers at King George's I&s;lands: but the&s;e double canoes, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, were not the canoes of Ottaheite, but &s;uch as it is pro|bable came from &s;ome neighbouring i&s;le, and
<PB N="178" REF="191">
only are &s;een here when the&s;e mighty chiefs vouch|&s;afe to vi&s;it each other, or to pay a more than or|dinary compliment to &s;trangers. King Portotow brought with him three large hogs, and a con|&s;iderable quantity of the fine&s;t cloth the coun|try afforded, which he pre&s;ented to the Captain, who received his pre&s;ents, and entertained his followers, each according to his rank; and being &s;hewn the curio&s;ities brought from Middleburgh and Am&s;terdam, &s;ome beautiful &s;carlet feathers took place of every other arti|cle, and became &s;o high in the e&s;timation of tho&s;e Chiefs, that for a plume they would give a hog. And now Am&s;terdam feathers took the lead in all their bargains; and happy the &s;ailor who had been provident enough to lay in a &s;tock.</P>
<P>25. This day it thundered, lightened, and rained to that degree that no man on board had ever remembered the like. The claps of thunder were &s;o loud and terrifying, that one could hardly conceive the report of 10,000 cannon fired off at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant to be more tremendous. The lightening ap|peared about the ma&s;ts and rigging like vor|tices of blue flame, the violence of which could only be abated by the torrents of rain that accompanied the lightening, and in all probability &s;aved the &s;hip from being &s;et on fire. This &s;torm la&s;ted for three hours, and
<PB N="179" REF="192">
was the mo&s;t terrifying our journali&s;t ever be|held. The afternoon was fair, and the natives came in from all quarters to welcome their friends; and to bring hogs and fruit to &s;ell for implements of iron, which &s;till bore a value among the multitude. The women now had made their choice, and when their mates were re|&s;trained from &s;leeping on &s;hore, they made no &s;ort of &s;cruple to come on board to &s;leep with them.</P>
<P>26. The whole i&s;land &s;eemed to be in agi|tation, and it was imagined that a general mu&s;ter of their whole force had taken place, preparatory to &s;ome grand warlike expedition, which the natives had in view. Above 600 canoes were ranged in order of battle. In each of the&s;e canoes were placed upright in &s;ockets, a certain number of lances of various lengths, mo&s;t of them headed with the tail bones of the &s;ting-ray, the wounds with which generally prove mortal; and they had be&s;ides heaps of &s;tones piled up on &s;tages, in like man|ner as cannon-balls are piled up in European ar|&s;enals. This warlike appearance attracted the notice of Captain Cooke and his officers, who ordered the pinnace to be in&s;tantly got in rea|dine&s;s, and went him&s;elf to ob&s;erve their mo|tions; but upon his approach, they &s;eparated, and every man retired to his own home. What|ever was the intent of this mu&s;ter, whether it
<PB N="180" REF="193">
was only an occa&s;ional review, or whether it was preparatory to an attack upon any of the neigbouring i&s;lands, or with a view to &s;urprize the &s;hip, no mea&s;ure that followed gave &s;uffi|cient grounds to determine.</P>
<P>27. All things appeared peaceable, the In|dians came as u&s;ual about the &s;hip to trade, and the gentlemen and others employed them&s;elves on &s;hore without mole&s;tation. It was however judged nece&s;&s;ary to keep a watchful eye over them, le&s;t over-&s;ecurity &s;hould invite any mi&s;|chievous attempt.</P>
<P>From the 27th of April, till the 8th of May nothing worth relating happened to the &s;hip's company; but on that day the coopers being at work in repairing the ca&s;ks by the river &s;ide, they mi&s;&s;ed one of the number, and could not conceive by what invi&s;ible hand it could have been conveyed away, as a watch was &s;et in the night to prevent any &s;uch accident, and a guard in the day kept con&s;tantly at the tents; tho&s;e of the &s;hip's crew who happened to be on &s;hore were all &s;trictly examined, as well as the watch and the guard; and one and all declared they knew nothing of the theft, nor was it likely they &s;hould, having no means of concealing the thing &s;tolen. Complaint was therefore made to the chiefs, who, in compliment to the gen|tlemen re&s;ided near the tents, that a theft had been committed, and that none but the &s;ub|tile&s;t
<PB N="181" REF="194">
among their people could be the robber. It was therefore in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;trict &s;earch &s;hould be made, and that as the thing lo&s;t was of &s;uch a bulk as not ea&s;ily to be &s;ecreted, it was urged that it might be recoverd, and the offender brought to ju&s;tice, if tho&s;e who were employed in the pur&s;uit were in earne&s;t to de|tect him. To this remon&s;trance, menaces were added, and the whole i&s;land threatened if the ca&s;k was not produced, and the thief delivered up. This cau&s;ed great con&s;ternation and con|fu&s;ion among the chiefs; they pre&s;ently a&s;&s;em|bled a large body of their people together, which they have a ready way of doing, and one of the chiefs made a long and very pe|remptory &s;peech, which he delivered with a &s;evere countenance; and as &s;oon as he had ended, &s;everal per&s;ons were ob&s;erved to pur|&s;ue different routs, in order as it proved to ap|prehend the felon: It was &s;ome time before he was found, but it has been ob&s;erved by former voyagers, that whenever any capital theft was meditated, their chiefs had &s;ome general know|ledge of the intent before it was carried into exe|cution, and yet it was not believed that they were either to be partakers of the booty or parties in the de&s;ign. Something like this &s;e|cret intelligence was very ob&s;ervable in the ca&s;e we are now relating; for a more artful robbery never was devi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="195">On the 9th of May the offender was brought in triumph by one party, and the ca&s;k by ano|ther.</P>
<P>Upon his examination it appeared, that the fellow had laid his &s;cheme &s;ome time before he executed it; that he had prepared for it by contriving a cavity in an over-grown bu&s;hy part of a &s;edgy &s;wamp adjoining to the river, ju&s;t big enough to contain the ca&s;k; and this being ready, he went in the dead of the night to a winding nook at &s;ome di&s;tance from the watch and &s;entry, but within hearing of both when every thing was &s;till. Here he plunged him&s;elf into the water, and kept floundering about till he had attracted the notice of the guard, and when by peeping over the bank, he perceived they were making towards the place where the noi&s;e was; he &s;wam &s;ilently under water, till he came near the &s;pot where the ca&s;k he had in view was &s;tanding on the edge of the bank. This he &s;oftly pulled into the water, and made off with it, placing it be|tween his neck and his &s;houlders, that he might not alarm the guard upon their return by the noi&s;e of pu&s;hing it before him in the water: they were &s;ome con&s;iderable time in &s;earching about in order to di&s;cover what had occa&s;ion|ed &s;o &s;trange a plunging, during which the fellow found means to &s;ecret his prize, which he had &s;o artfully covered, that it might have
<PB N="183" REF="196">
lain many years without being found, had not the hider confe&s;&s;ed in what manner he had di&s;po&s;ed of it. Though the ingenuity of this fellow might have pleaded his pardon, yet it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h him as a terror to others: he was therefoer tied up and &s;e|verely whipt after the manner of the di&s;cipline of the navy for offences of the like nature; and this was done in pre&s;ence of the Chiefs of the i&s;land, and a great concour&s;e of the natives who attended the execution, and who looked with an evil eye upon tho&s;e concerned in what they called a cruel puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This, however, cruel as it was thought, did not deter others from committing the like of|fences; for it was not long before another of them was detected on board the &s;hip in &s;teal|ing two jackets, and being caught in the fact, was tied to the geers, and received twelve la&s;hes.</P>
<P>Much about this time one of the &s;entinels upon the watch unfortunately falling a&s;leep, lo&s;t his mu&s;ket, This was judged to be a theft of much greater con&s;equence than either of the other two; for though it was certain they could make no bad u&s;e of one mu&s;ket, and one charge of powder and ball, yet as it had been the con&s;tant policy of tho&s;e who vi&s;ited the i&s;land before, to keep the natives as igno|rant as po&s;&s;ible in the u&s;e of fire-arms, the
<PB N="184" REF="197">
Captain determined to furni&s;h them with no means of enlarging their knowledge from any neglect of his. He therefore began by puni&s;h|ing the &s;entinel in a mo&s;t exemplary manner for his breach of duty, that the natives might be eye-witne&s;&s;es of the &s;everity with which the people belonging to the &s;hip were puni&s;hed when they committed any offence; and being informed that prince Ottoo was privy to the theft, and that he was removed from Eparre, the royal re&s;idence, to a di&s;tant part of the country, the Captain di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger after him. At the &s;ame time &s;everal other great men, having embarked in their canoes, were making off with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy and ha&s;te; but being di&s;covered from the &s;hip, were in&s;tantly pur&s;ued. The Captain, who him&s;elf commanded in the pur&s;uit, made &s;ig|nals for them to bring to, to which they paid no regard: at length he gave orders to fire; but as none of them were hurt by that order they rowed on. The fire was renewed, and the bullets flying thick about their boats, they at length thought proper to yield. When they were taken on board, they were &s;hewn the &s;entinel in irons, and were given to under&s;tand that he was again to be puni&s;hed if his mu&s;ket was not returned, and that he would in the end be killed for not killing the man in at|tempting to &s;teal and to carry it away. This
<PB N="185" REF="198">
was &s;aid to move their pity; for they are very compa&s;&s;ionate, and will weep bitterly at the &s;ight of a per&s;on in the agony of pain; but their tears are like the tears of children, ea&s;ily excited, and as ea&s;ily dried up. They were at the &s;ame time told, that, as by their flight it was manife&s;t that they were not unacquainted with the robbery, and that there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that if prince Ottoo was not him&s;elf the robber, he had been in&s;trumental in pro|moting it, if they did not cau&s;e it to be return|ed in a limited time, the Captain declared with a &s;evere tone of voice, that he would &s;et fire to every boat about the i&s;land, and would not leave them a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el to go out to fi&s;h with. This was ob&s;erved to work a much more powerful effect than the method taken to excite their pity. They de&s;ired to be re|lea&s;ed, and promi&s;ed to recover the mu&s;ket, and to &s;end it on board; and in this they kept their word.</P>
<P>The very next morning a party of the na|tives brought it in a kind of rapture, as if by returning it they had delivered their country from impending ruin; as ruin it would cer|tainly have been, had their boats been burnt. This party a&s;&s;ured the Captain, by me&s;&s;age from prince Ottoo, that he had left the fel|low who had &s;tolen the mu&s;ket dead in the woods, and de&s;ired an interview with him to
<PB N="186" REF="199">
convince him of the fact. The Captain re|turned for an&s;wer, that he would wait upon the prince at the royal palace, to which he might return in &s;afety, and that he wanted no other evidence of the truty of what they had reported than the prince's royal word. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the me&s;&s;engers with pre&s;ents; and to fulfil his promi&s;e, began to prepare him&s;elf for a vi&s;it to Eparre, the place appointed for the interview with Ottoo, for till that was obtain|ed, and the affair reconciled, all trade was to|tally prohibited, and not a &s;ingle article to be purcha&s;ed at any price.</P>
<P>Next day &s;ome of Ottoo's chief officers came aboard, and acquainted the Captain, that Ottoo was &s;till under great concern, and rather wi&s;hed to receive him at the place of his pre&s;ent re&s;idence than at Eparre; but that if he would conde&s;cend to come without a guard, he would meet him at the palace. The Cap|tain having nothing more in view than to re|e&s;tabli&s;h a good under&s;tanding with the natives, very readily gave his con&s;ent to come unat|tended; and farther a&s;&s;ured them, if his high|ne&s;s was &s;till under any dread, he would &s;end one of his officers as a &s;ecurity that no indig|nity &s;hould be offered to his per&s;on, nor any in&s;ult to any of his retinue, provided they be|haved with becoming re&s;pect. This having di&s;&s;ipated his fears, the manner of the vi&s;it was
<PB N="187" REF="200">
&s;ettled, and the time fixed for the parties to meet, which was at nine the next morning.</P>
<P>As the di&s;tance from the &s;hip was about four miles, and no carriage to be had, the Captain &s;et out pretty early with only Mr. Fo&s;ter, and one or two officers to attend him. When he arrived he found the prince &s;itting in a very pen&s;ive mood; but when he was told that the gentlemen who were now before him were all the retinue the Captain had brought with him, he rea&s;&s;umed a more chearful and lively air, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire to renew the peace by all the humiliating ways he could in|vent. The Captain, on the other hand, know|ing the con&s;equences of widening the breach, received his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with the greate&s;t ala|crity, and entered familiarly into conver&s;ation with the women, who always on the&s;e occa|&s;ions make a part of the company, as did the other gentlemen with tho&s;e indifferently who compo&s;ed the circle. Thus matters being cleared up, and all that had pa&s;t forgiven on both &s;ides, the Captain was de&s;irous of taking his leave, and in return invited the prince and his nobles to accompany him on board; but this they all declined, as not being properly prepared, they, however, gave him to under|&s;tand, that it &s;hould not be long before they accepted of his invitation. Accordingly in a few days prince Ottoo with many of his
<PB N="188" REF="201">
chiefs and attendants in three canoes were ob&s;erved making towards the &s;hip. They had with them as pre&s;ents, hogs, fruit, and cloth; and they in&s;i&s;ted that no return &s;hould be made for any thing that they pre&s;ented; and, not to give offence, nothing was offered, but a vari|ety of curio&s;ities were laid in their way, which the Captain knew it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e people to refu&s;e. They looked wi&s;hfully at many things, but touched nothing. They were pre&s;&s;ed to dine, and they did not &s;eem di&s;plea&s;ed with the attention paid them: they were entertained and amu&s;ed by various ways till dinner was ready, and particularly with mu&s;ic and dancing in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, which gave them infinite plea&s;ure, as among other humorous performances a hornpipe was intro|duced, at which they could &s;carce contain them&s;elves. When notice was given that din|ner was upon the table, and chairs were &s;et, it was no &s;mall diver&s;ion to &s;ee the aukward figure they made, for they neither knew how to &s;it upon a chair, nor how to feed them|&s;elves with knife and fork. Their Chiefs are fed like children by their &s;ervants; but &s;ome &s;oups being prepared, and &s;poons put into their hands, they made &s;hift to help them|&s;elves with tho&s;e, and to eat heartily. They were offered wines of various &s;orts unmixed, and afterwards mixed with water, but they
<PB N="189" REF="202">
would drink nothing but water. Such is the force of cu&s;tom, that water by them was pre|ferred to the mo&s;t precious liquor the &s;hip af|forded.</P>
<P>After they had dined they were again di|verted with mu&s;ic and dancing, to which they paid the greate&s;t attention; and in the even|ing, after tea had been &s;erved up, they depart|ed, highly delighted with their day's enter|tainment.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting on board, the launch was employed on &s;hore in getting in wood for the &s;hip's u&s;e; but, as it is u&s;ual, when the principal officers are engaged, and the command entru&s;ted to inferiors, the failors will take liberties on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, which at other times they would not dare to a&s;&s;ume, two of tho&s;e who were ordered to do duty on board, in&s;tead of cutting wood, &s;trayed up the country in &s;earch of new mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es; and before their return, the launch had left her &s;tation, and was gone on board. This was a grievous di&s;appointment, and re|duced the poor fellows to the di&s;agreeable al|ternative of either hiring a canoe to take them on board, or returning to the woods to the company they had ju&s;t de&s;erted. In either ca&s;e they knew they &s;hould be puni&s;hed; but for lying out much more &s;everely than for imme|diately following the launch. The latter,
<PB N="190" REF="203">
therefore, they made their choice in hope, as hope &s;eldom de&s;erts the enterprizing, that the captain might not yet be made acquainted with their ab&s;ence, and that they might find favour with the officer to forbear complaint. They accordingly re&s;igned them&s;elves to chance, and rowed aboard; but unluckily for them, the report of their crime had out-run their dili|gence; and the irons in which they were to be confined were in readine&s;s to be applied as &s;oon as they had mounted the &s;hip's &s;ide. They then repented, when it was too late, the exchange they had made, and wi&s;hed they had been cap|tives to love, rather than pri&s;oners in irons, as the evil day might have been protracted, which now it was no longer in their power to delay; their puni&s;hment however was milder than they expected, having been &s;entenced to re|ceive only &s;ix la&s;hes each, when the &s;ame of|fence had u&s;ually been puni&s;hed with twelve.</P>
<P>Peace being now re&s;tored, plenty &s;ucceed|ed, and the &s;hip's company were more liberal|ly &s;upplied with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and at a cheaper rate than they had been at any time &s;ince their arrival in Matavey-bay.</P>
<P>The chiefs came now more frequently and familiarly on board than at fir&s;t; and the gen|tlemen, particularly Mr. Fo&s;ter, was more a&s;|&s;iduou&s;ly employed on &s;hore than had been hi|therto remarked: pains were taken too to
<PB N="191" REF="204">
keep the chiefs in good humour, by varying the diver&s;ions that were intended to amu&s;e them, and fire-works were &s;ometimes played off from the ma&s;t head to increa&s;e their a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and &s;ometimes from the tents to excite their admiration; the great guns, &s;hot|ted with round and grape, were fired off to &s;hew their effects; and &s;ometimes the marines were drawn up in order of battle to di&s;play their evolutions.</P>
<P>In this manner mutual re&s;pect and mutual de&s;ires to plea&s;e were pre&s;erved during the re|mainder of the &s;hip's &s;tay: The little interrup|tions that &s;ometimes happened between the common people and the &s;ailors, were here as in all other places, generally made up among them&s;elves; or, if complaint was made to the officer or principal chief, ju&s;tice was impar|tially dealt to both parties.</P>
<P>On the 12th of May, preparations were made for leaving their &s;tation; but it was not imagined that the captain intended to &s;ail for &s;ome time to come; a few &s;mall ca&s;ks of water were taken on board in the day, and at night fire-works were renewed, which though none of the be&s;t, filled the &s;pectators with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment; but ju&s;t as the fire-works had cea&s;ed, it began to thunder and lighten, which now terrified the poor Indians more than the fire-works had plea&s;ed them before, ima|gining
<PB N="192" REF="205">
their deities were angry, becau&s;e the &s;trangers had u&s;urped their power. Such are the effects of &s;uper&s;tition upon unenlightened minds.</P>
<P>On the 13th the natives perceived that the &s;trangers were making preparations to depart; they therefore flocked to the &s;hip's &s;ide with every kind of thing they thought of value, in order to purcha&s;e nails, knives, adzes, hatchets, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, or iron of any &s;ort manufactured or not. Hogs were now &s;o plenty they might be purcha&s;ed as formerly, for an adze or an hat|chet, of which the armourers being apprized of their value had made many for trade.</P>
<P>On the 14th the captain, with his officers and attendants went on &s;hore to take leave of the great men of the i&s;land, who had invited them to &s;ee a play at the palace; the&s;e plays differ in nothing from tho&s;e de&s;cribed in vol. III. of the Voyages round the World, except in their &s;implicity, tho&s;e of Huaheiney being more artificial and complex. They &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t, like the Venetian comedies, of no|thing but attitude and grimace, and have &s;omething re&s;embling the tricks of harlequin, in which one is always in pur&s;uit, while the other is bu&s;ied in contriving to elude his &s;earch.</P>
<P>About two in the afternoon the gentlemen returned, and with them Prince Ottoo, and
<PB N="193" REF="206">
his father, with a multitude of attendants, who brought their boats loaded with hogs, &s;ome turtle, and a dolphin; delicacies which it was thought the i&s;land did not produce. About three the captain &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to de|part in earne&s;t, and this being made public, the girls came crouding about the &s;hip, cry|ing and lamenting as if parting from their near|e&s;t and deare&s;t relations. It is not to be con|ceived what an exce&s;s of grief they expre&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, and &s;ome of the common men appeared them&s;elves not to be wholly un|affected when they parted with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. We have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved that the&s;e people have tears at will, whenever they are di&s;po&s;ed to counterfeit &s;orrow; but there is very little rea&s;on to imagine that tho&s;e tears flow from the heart; for the men cry here as frequently as the women.</P>
<P>At parting with the captain, the nobles ap|peared to be very much affected, and as they ju&s;t then communicated to him the rea&s;on of their mu&s;tering in the manner already de&s;cri|bed, and that in five days they &s;hould go to war with the people of Maurua, or York-I&s;|land, he gave them an Engli&s;h pendant, which he taught them how to di&s;play on the day of battle, and endeavoured to in&s;pire them with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic notion, that while they pre&s;erv|ed that &s;tandard, they never &s;hould be over|come.
<PB N="194" REF="207">
And as the&s;e people look upon the Europeans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gifts &s;uperior to them|&s;elves, it is not to be que&s;tioned that the &s;ight of the &s;tandard will add to their courage, and that the per&s;ua&s;ion of there being virtue in it to en&s;ure victory, will redouble their ardour to obtain it.</P>
<P>Being now about to take our final leave of this celebrated i&s;land, we &s;hall endeavour to give the reader a more di&s;tinct view of its &s;itu|ation, general figure, and extent, than has hi|therto appeared; and to bring together in their order many things which mark the character of the inhabitants, and which are only to be met with in detached parts, without order and with|out reference. To do this it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to reduce the matter of which we intend to treat into di&s;tinct heads, which, for the &s;ake of bre|vity, we &s;hall forbear to enumerate, but &s;hall range them in their proper order. And,</P>
<P>1. Of the &s;ituation of the i&s;land, which is perhaps the happie&s;t in the world, being ex|po&s;ed to none of tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold which are ob&s;erved to have &s;o &s;en&s;ible an effect on the health and &s;pirits of tho&s;e who live in the remoter regions. Its exact po&s;ition is from latitude 17 deg. 28 min. to lat. 17 deg. 53 min. S. and from long. 149 deg. 10 min. to long. 149 deg. 40 min. W. It lies nearly N. W. and S. E. and is divided into two di&s;tinct prin|cipalities
<PB N="195" REF="208">
by an i&s;thmus, or neck of land not three miles over. The north-we&s;terly divi&s;ion is however much larger, more fertile, but by no means &s;o well cultivated as the &s;outh-ea&s;terly divi&s;ion, which &s;hews that even the defects of nature have their u&s;e in prompting men to in|du&s;try and art to &s;upply their wants.</P>
<P>2. The figure of the large&s;t penin&s;ula, as it may be called, is nearly circular, being from North to South about 20 miles, and from Ea&s;t to We&s;t nearly the &s;ame. The whole is &s;ur|rounded with a reef of rocks. The le&s;&s;er penin&s;ula is rather of an oval form, and from the neck of land on the North We&s;t &s;ide to the little i&s;le of Otooareitte on the South Ea&s;t is about 12 miles; but from the mouth of the river Omatea on the South, to that of Owahe on the North not more than eight. The cir|cumference of the large&s;t penin&s;ula is about 60 miles, the circumference of the &s;malle&s;t about 24; but in &s;ailing round both, the line will be extended to 90 nearly.</P>
<P>3. For a particular account of the produce of the i&s;land, we are indebted no doubt to the indefatigable indu&s;try of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, from who&s;e materials the following catalogue is collected; namely, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, bananas of thirteen &s;orts; plan|tains; a fruit not unlike an apple, which when ripe is very plea&s;ant; &s;weet potatoes, yams,
<PB N="196" REF="209">
cocoas; a kind of arum; a fruit called by the natives jambu, very delicious; &s;ugar-cane; a root of the &s;aloop kind called pea; a plant called ethee; a fruit not unlike a kidney-bean called by the natives ahee, and when roa&s;ted ta&s;tes like che&s;nuts; a tree called wharra, which produces a fruit not unlike a pine|apple; a &s;hrub called nono; the morinda, which al&s;o produces fruit; a &s;pecies of fern; and a plant called eve, of which the roots only are eaten; all the&s;e which &s;erve the inha|bitants for food the earth produces &s;pontane|ou&s;ly; and there are be&s;ides a great variety of trees, &s;hrubs, and plants, which &s;erve for the various purpo&s;es of building hou&s;es, ve&s;&s;els for navigation, making tools, uten&s;ils of various kinds; manufactures, dyes, &amp;c. which it would only tire the reader to recount.</P>
<P>4. The four-footed animals are but few which the i&s;land produces, none having been &s;een on the fir&s;t landing of the Europeans but hogs, dogs, and rats; of the la&s;t the inhabitants are very fond. Poultry did not abound, nor is their poultry by any means &s;o well flavoured as tho&s;e of Europe. Their wild fowl are ducks only; and the birds that haunt the woods are chiefly pidgeons and paraquets; but with fi&s;h the coa&s;t abounds, of which the varieties are endle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="210">5. The general appearance of the i&s;land is very inviting; it is &s;kirted with a mo&s;t beauti|ful plain, and it is watered with a multitude of &s;mall rivulets, which in that climate is a ble&s;&s;ing denied to many otherwi&s;e enchanting i&s;les. As the eye is extended from the &s;hore the pro&s;pect ri&s;es into hills and dales, fore&s;ts and mountains, enriched with hou&s;es and plantations, and ornamented with the riche&s;t clothing of nature, a perpetual verdure. No|thing can exceed the view of their hou&s;es, &s;tanding upon &s;mall pillars among groves of beautiful trees unencumbered with any kind of underwood, and undeformed with brakes or bu&s;hes to intercept the eye; it is indeed a paradi&s;e where the cur&s;e pronounced in Eden has not yet taken place. No man here is under the nece&s;&s;ity of getting his bread by the &s;weet of his brow.</P>
<P>6. Its inhabitants, particularly the Chiefs, are rather in &s;ize above the &s;tandard of the large&s;t Europeans. Their food, which is of the &s;imple&s;t kind, is not &s;uch as to promote gluttony; nor their drink, which is chiefly water, calculated to provoke intemperance. Their daily intercour&s;e with the ocean accu&s;|toms them from their youth to exerci&s;e; and the bu&s;ine&s;s of fi&s;hing, which in northern countries is the mo&s;t laborious of all employ|ments,
<PB N="198" REF="211">
is by them practi&s;ed for amu&s;ement. Tho&s;e who have repre&s;ented them as indolent, becau&s;e nature has &s;o bountifully provided for them as to leave them little to do, have yet mi&s;taken their character. Their Chiefs are their principal arti&s;ts; and their hou&s;es, public edifices, canals and manufactures, their uten|&s;ils, in&s;truments of war, working tools, their boats, and fi&s;hing-tackle, are proofs of their indu&s;try, which cannot be controverted. Em|ployments of this kind all tending to promote exerci&s;e, and to bani&s;h &s;loth, conduce to health; and no per&s;on was ever known to langui&s;h with any incurable di&s;ea&s;e among them, though it does not appear that the medical arts has yet made any con&s;iderable progre&s;s.&mdash;Much has been &s;aid of the gracefulne&s;s of their per&s;ons; but if we may judge of the re&s;t by Autorou and Omia, who have been imported into Eu|rope, they have very little to boa&s;t of that perfection. Their Chiefs have undoubtedly a comparative dignity; but that compari&s;on is to be confined at home between prince and pea|&s;ant, and not extended to European countries, where grace and dignity are leading characters. Their women differ from each other in per|&s;onal charms, as in all other countries; but in &s;tature, tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank take e&s;pecial care to pre&s;erve the family di&s;tinction. It is not uncommon for ladies of the fir&s;t rank to
<PB N="199" REF="212">
&s;ingle out a hand&s;ome well proportioned youth to prevent degeneracy, when the &s;tature of the family is in danger of being reduced; but they are otherwi&s;e &s;crupulous in nothing &s;o much as in mixing with the canaille, and there is hardly an in&s;tance of their cohabiting indi&s;cri|minately with the lower cla&s;s of people. There is perhaps no nation where the pride of ance&s;|try is carried to a greater height, and yet they have no means of recording their pedigree but by oral tradition, nor any rule for continuing the line but what nature has impre&s;&s;ed upon the mother. As they have no &s;chools, no|thing is to be acquired by education; they are wholly governed by example; the pattern &s;et by the father is followed by the &s;on, and what the mother does, that the daughter learns; but this is not to be under&s;tood to perpetuate hu&s;bandry and arts as in China, in particular families; for in Ottaheite hu&s;bandry and arts are not impo&s;ed as ta&s;ks, but are rather amu&s;e|ments to pa&s;s away time. None are compelled to work, yet all are employed; their &s;everal &s;tations chance &s;eems to have allotted; and here there is no murmuring again&s;t providence for not being more bountiful. One precau|tion ob&s;erved among the great in order to give vigour to their Chiefs mu&s;t not be omitted, and that is, they never &s;uffer an intercour&s;e between the &s;exes till both parties arrive at full
<PB N="200" REF="213">
maturity. The very rever&s;e of this is practi&s;|ed by the multitude, who are in general of mean &s;tature, and as much below the common &s;tandard as their Chiefs exceed it. They are almo&s;t all tattowed, women as well as men; in this too there &s;eems to be &s;omething my&s;ti|cal; the prie&s;t performs the office, and the poor children are encouraged by example to endure the pain, and &s;urely nothing can be more acute. To have a thou&s;and punctures all at once, with the blood &s;tarting at every puncture, is more, one would think, than a child could bear, yet they &s;uffer it with a for|titude of which in Europe there is no example. Their hair is almo&s;t univer&s;ally black, and the men wear it long, waving in ringlets down their &s;houlders; the women cut it &s;hort round their ears; both &s;exes &s;uffer none to grow un|der their arms, and are very delicate in keep|ing every part about them &s;weet and clean; for this purpo&s;e they frequently bathe, &s;eldom &s;uffering a day to pa&s;s without going into the water more than once. Indeed they anoint their heads with an oil expre&s;&s;ed from the cocoa-nut, which &s;ometimes proving rancid, emits a di&s;agreeable &s;avour that cu&s;tom only has familiarized. They are otherwi&s;e in their per&s;ons without a taint. A memorable ex|pre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Banks, <HI>That if our &s;ailors quar|relled</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="214"><HI>with the&s;e people, they would not agree with angels,</HI> &s;ufficiently denotes the goodne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>7. Their cu&s;toms in eating, are very &s;ingu|lar, and they certainly entertain &s;ome &s;uper&s;ti|tious notions not ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by &s;tran|gers. The women are not permitted to eat with the men; not, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to mark their inferiority, but in conformity to a cu&s;tom which habit has e&s;tabli&s;hed into a law; nor is it u&s;ual for any of them to eat in company, ex|cept upon certain days of fe&s;tivity, when great numbers of them a&s;&s;emble together. A me&s;&s;en|ger from Captain Wallis, found Oberea, the &s;uppo&s;ed Queen of the i&s;land, entertaining a company, which he &s;uppo&s;ed could not be le&s;s than a thou&s;and; the me&s;&s;es were all brought to her by the &s;ervants that prepared them, the meat being put into the &s;hells of cocoa-nuts, and the &s;hells into wooden trays, and &s;he di&s;|tributed them with her own hands to the gue&s;ts, who were &s;eated in rows round the pa|lace. This done, &s;he &s;at down her&s;elf upon a &s;eat &s;omewhat elevated above the re&s;t, and two women placing them&s;elves, one on each &s;ide of her, fed her like a child; when &s;he &s;aw the me&s;&s;enger &s;he ordered a me&s;s for him.</P>
<P>They have two ways of dre&s;&s;ing their animal food, broiling and baking; the fir&s;t is per|formed over hot &s;tones, without any other
<PB N="202" REF="215">
contrivance than placing the meat upon the clean &s;tones, and when broiled enough on one &s;ide, they turn it, and broil the other; but their manner of baking is &s;omewhat &s;ingular: they fir&s;t dig a hole in the ground, in depth and dimen&s;ions proportioned to the thing they have to dre&s;s; they then place a layer of wood at bottom, and over that a layer of &s;tones; and &s;o alternately a layer of wood, and a layer of &s;tones, till the hole is full: the fire is then kindled, and the &s;tones made hot; this done, they take out the fire, and placing the &s;tones that are lea&s;t heated, one be&s;ide the other, at the bottom of the hole, they cover them with fre&s;h leaves from the tree, and on the&s;e they put the meat they have to bake, properly cleaned and &s;ea&s;oned, and then, after laying another layer of green leaves, they fill up the hole with the remaining hot &s;tones, and then clo&s;e the whole with the mould that was fir&s;t dug out of the pit. In this &s;ituation the meat is &s;uf|fered to remain for three or four hours; and when taken out is then &s;o &s;avoury, as not to be exceeded by the be&s;t European cookery; almo&s;t all the fle&s;h and fi&s;h eaten by the chiefs in the i&s;land is dre&s;&s;ed in one or the other of the above two ways; the latter is mo&s;t in u&s;e among the gentry; the former among the com|monalty, who &s;ometimes, indeed, eat their fi&s;h without dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="216">Tables they have none, and tho&s;e of the highe&s;t quality dine on the ground under the &s;hade of a &s;preading tree; fre&s;h green leaves &s;erve them for a cloth, and a ba&s;ket which is &s;et down by them holds their provi&s;ion; two cocoa nuts, one filled with &s;alt-water, the other with fre&s;h, compleat the whole preparation for a meal; and when the&s;e are brought, and the leaves &s;et in order, they begin by fir&s;t wa&s;hing their hands and mouth; that done, they pro|ceed to examine the contents of the ba&s;ket: Whatever is brought is ready dre&s;&s;ed, and neatly wrapped up in clean leaves; if fi&s;h, they break the fi&s;h with their hands into the &s;alt water, and with the tips of the fingers and thumb take it to their mouths with as much of the &s;alt water as adheres to the fi&s;h; if fle&s;h, they cut it, or rather &s;ever it with a wooden knife, and dip it in the &s;alt water as they do the fi&s;h; bread-fruit &s;erves them in&s;tead of bread; and thus they proceed till the animal food, or as much as they like of it, is eaten. They then wa&s;h as before, and begin their ve|getables, which generally con&s;i&s;t of a prepara|tion of bread-fruit, with a quantity of <HI>mabie,</HI> (a &s;ort of &s;our-leven) plantains, bananas, cocoa-nuts and apples. When all is over they wa&s;h their hands and mouth a third time, and then, if nothing calls them abroad, they u&s;ually lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="217">It was long before any of them could be per&s;uaded to eat with the Europeans, and they certainly, like the Jews, have &s;ome &s;uper&s;ti|tious ceremonies to be ob&s;erved in the prepa|ration of the food they eat, which, if omitted, renders it unclean, or they would not have continued &s;crupulous &s;o long. Even the food of their women is differently prepared from that of the men; and if touched by unhallow|ed hands, is accounted unclean, and con&s;e|quently unfit for u&s;e. Like the Jews, they were not aver&s;e to the &s;trangers eating with them, though it was with the utmo&s;t reluc|tance that they eat with the &s;trangers. Some of the gentlemen, when invited to their hou&s;es, eat out of the &s;ame ba&s;ket, and drank out of the &s;ame cup with their ho&s;ts; but it was ob|&s;erved that the elder women were always of|fended with this liberty; and if they happen|ed to touch tho&s;e antient matrons victuals, or even the ba&s;ket that held it, they never failed to expre&s;s their di&s;like, and to throw it away; nor would the women of fa&s;hion ever be per|&s;uaded to eat with the gentlemen, when dining in company: but what &s;eems mo&s;t &s;trange, and hardly to be accounted for, they would go, five or &s;ix in company, into the &s;ervants apart|ments, and eat heartily of whatever they could find; nor did they &s;eem in the lea&s;t di&s;concert|ed, if they were di&s;covered in doing it; yet it
<PB N="205" REF="218">
was not ea&s;y to per&s;uade any of them when alone, in private with a gentleman, to eat with him, nor would they ever do it but under the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es of &s;ecrecy. When the chiefs fir&s;t vi&s;ited Mr. Banks and his a&s;&s;ociates at the tents, each brought his ba&s;ket with him, and when the gentlemen &s;at down to din|ner, they withdrew, &s;at them&s;elves down upon the ground at two or three yards di&s;tance from each other, and turning their faces dif|ferent ways, took each man his ba&s;ket, and dined without &s;peaking a word; and they could not help expre&s;&s;ing their di&s;like, and even di&s;gu&s;t, at the gentlemen dining in com|pany. It was with no le&s;s difficulty that any of them were prevailed upon to drink with the gentlemen; but &s;ome of them having at length been over-per&s;uaded, and having been made very drunk, were the next day &s;o very &s;ick, that they never afterwards would touch any of the liquors that were offered them.</P>
<P>8. Their amu&s;ements are various, &s;uch as mu&s;ic, dancing, wre&s;tling, &s;hooting with the bow, darting their lances, &s;wimming, rowing, and &s;linging of &s;tones. Their mu&s;ic is indeed very imperfect, con&s;i&s;ting only of a flute and a drum, yet, with the&s;e, companies go about the country and frequent their fe&s;tivals, being in equal e&s;timation with them as morris-dancers were formerly with us, and the diver&s;ion they
<PB N="206" REF="219">
make is not un&s;imilar. In &s;hooting the long|bow, or in throwing the lance, they by no means excel; neither are they very dexterous at wre&s;tling; but at throwing &s;tones, and &s;wimming, they are perhaps equal to any peo|ple upon earth.</P>
<P>Among their other diver&s;ions, they have their heivas, very nearly corre&s;ponding with our ancient wakes. The young people meet together to dance and to make merry; and at the&s;e meetings their min&s;trels and players con|&s;tantly attend, as formerly per&s;ons of the &s;ame character were wont to do all over England, and in &s;ome counties the ve&s;tiges of that an|cient cu&s;tom remain to this day. At the&s;e heivas, however, their girls in their dances have no regard to decency; and though the &s;ame end was no doubt in view in the in&s;titu|tion of the wake and the heiva, yet what in England was concerted with the greate&s;t &s;e|crecy, is in Ottaheite publickly avowed and practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that though the in&s;trumental mu&s;ic of the Ottaheiteans is much confined, the vocal mu&s;ic is by no means contemptible; yet in the &s;weetne&s;s of the voice con&s;i&s;ts all the melody, for they have no rules to regulate the tones. Their &s;ongs are like the &s;ongs of chil|dren, accompanied with words of their own compo&s;ing, which they can-vary into long
<PB N="207" REF="220">
and &s;hort ver&s;es, &s;prightly or &s;olemn as occa|&s;ion pre&s;ents; and as the language it&s;elf is mu|&s;ical, the &s;tranger is no le&s;s delighted with the arrante&s;t non&s;en&s;e, than he would be with the mo&s;t &s;ublime compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The heivas are indi&s;criminately frequented by all ranks of people among the Ottaheiteans; but there is &s;till a more exceptionable meeting held by &s;ome of the principal people, to which tho&s;e only are admitted who are properly ini|tiated. The&s;e people form a di&s;tinct &s;ociety, in which every woman is common to every man; and at their meetings, which are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of Arreoy, the &s;ports they practi&s;e are beyond imagination wanton:
"There is (&s;ays the writer of the Endeavour's Voyage) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a &s;cale of &s;en&s;uality which the&s;e people have a&s;cended wholly unknown to every other nation who&s;e manners have been recorded, from the beginning of the world to the pre&s;ent hour, and which no imagina|tion could conceive;"</Q>
and yet, notwith|&s;tanding this very &s;evere cen&s;ure and po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, we may trace &s;omething very like it in the hi&s;tory of the ancient inhabitants of our own i&s;land. The following are the words of Sir William Temple, a writer of no &s;mall au|thority, who in reciting the cu&s;tom makes nearly the &s;ame ob&s;ervation with the learned voyage writer.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="221">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One cu&s;tom there was (&s;ays Sir William) among the ancient Britons, which &s;eems peculiar to them&s;elves, and not found in the &s;tories of any other nations either civil or barbarous, which was a &s;ociety of wives among certain numbers; and by common con&s;ent every man married a &s;ingle woman, who was always after and alone e&s;teemed his wife; but it was u&s;ual for five or &s;ix, ten or twelve, or more, either brothers or friends, as they could agree, to have all their wives in common. <HI>Encounters</HI> happened among them, as they were invited by de&s;ire, or favoured by opportunity. Every wo|man's children were attributed to him that had married her; but all had a &s;hare in the care and defence of the while &s;ociety, &s;ince no man knew which were his own. Though this cu&s;tom be alledged as a te&s;timony how &s;avage or barbarous a people the Britons were, yet (adds Sir William) I know not why it &s;hould appear more extravagant than the community of women in &s;ome other countries, the deflowering of virgins by the prie&s;ts on the fir&s;t night of marriage, the unlimited number of wives and concubines, not to mention the marriage of &s;i&s;ters among the ancient Egyptians and Athenians, and the borrowing and lending of wives among the Romans."</Q>
Thus it appears that &s;ome|thing
<PB N="209" REF="222">
very like this ladder of &s;en&s;uality had been a&s;cended by our ance&s;tors, probably as early, if not before, the &s;ociety we are &s;peaking of had exi&s;tence; and I believe if we were to tran&s;mit an impartial record of the manners of the pre|&s;ent times, &s;omething &s;till more &s;imilar to all the <HI>aggravated circum&s;tances</HI> of this barbarous cu&s;tom in Ottaheite (where when a woman happens to prove with child, the writer &s;ays, the poor in|fant is <HI>&s;mothered</HI> the moment it is born, that it may be no <HI>incumbrance to the father,</HI> nor <HI>in|terrupt the mother in the plea&s;ures</HI> of her diabo|lical pro&s;titution, might be traced in the pur|lieus of Covent-Garden, and the alleys in and about Drury-Lane. Perhaps it would be no exaggeration if we were to add, that in the city of London there are as many men as the whole i&s;land of Ottaheite contains, who devote them&s;elves entirely to the plea&s;ures of variety, and who attach them&s;elves to no one woman, but enjoy indi&s;criminately all they may; and that there are an equal number of women to be met with, who are at all times ready to gra|tify their de&s;ires; nor have the&s;e men or the&s;e women any more regard for their poor infants, than the members of that diabolical &s;ociety, again&s;t which the piety of the writer prompted him to exclaim. We &s;aid <HI>aggravated circum|&s;tances,</HI> becau&s;e as the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by the writer for &s;mothering the poor infants are to
<PB N="210" REF="223">
the la&s;t degree futile, it may be pre&s;umed that the children of &s;uch general commerce may, like the children of our ance&s;tors, be con&s;ider|ed as the children of the &s;ociety, &s;ince &s;mother|ing the child as &s;oon as born, would not &s;horten, the interruptions nece&s;&s;arily impeding the plea|&s;ures of the mother, nor encumber a father that could not be known.</P>
<P>Among people &s;o immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;uality one would think dre&s;s would be no ornament, but the contrary; yet among the Ottaheitean ladies dre&s;s &s;eems to be as much &s;tudied as among the ladies of more civilized nations. It is not a little remarkable however, that nei|ther the feet or legs of the fir&s;t ladies of qua|lity in Ottaheite have any covering or other defence from the ground on which they tread, or from the &s;corching heat of the &s;un, which at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons is very inten&s;e. But they are very nice in ornamenting their heads, and in &s;had|ing their faces. Their chief head-dre&s;s, in which they pride them&s;elves the mo&s;t, is threads of human hair &s;o delicately plaited, that it is not unu&s;ual for them to have gar|lands of this manufacture would round their heads, that were they to be unfolded, would encircle St. Paul's; the plaits whereof being be&s;et with flowers have a very pretty effect, and are exceedingly becoming to young faces. In their ears they wear ornaments, which be|fore
<PB N="211" REF="224">
the European beads &s;upplanted all others, con&s;i&s;ted of any thing red, &s;hining, or &s;hewy. The other part of their dre&s;s has nothing par|ticular, it is very &s;imple, and needs neither taylor nor mantua-maker to make it up. A piece of cloth about a yard and a half wide, and between three and four yards long, is plac|ed upon a table, and a hole cut in the middle ju&s;t big enough to let the head pa&s;s ea&s;ily through, and this flows round them, and co|vers them to a little below the wai&s;t; from thence a large quantity of the &s;ame cloth is gathered in folds, and tied round them as we tie a cravat round the neck, which being drawn into a large knot is again &s;pread out, and flows artle&s;sly down before nearly as low as the knees, while the greate&s;t quantity of cloth falls down be|hind, in appearance not unlike the dre&s;s of the Roman orators. This dre&s;s is far from being ungraceful, and there is but little difference between that of the &s;exes, except that the lower garments of the men are nearly of an equal length before and behind. Some of the Chiefs had dre&s;&s;es made after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, of which they were very proud. The cloth they wear is of very different textures; that which is worn in dry weather is no other than paper made of the rind of trees, of which a more particular de&s;cription under the head of ma|nufactures will be given; but that which they
<PB N="212" REF="225">
put on when it rains is more &s;ub&s;tantial, and is properly a kind of matting incomparably platted. The &s;hape of their clothing, like that of our own, is nearly the &s;ame from the prince to the pea&s;ant; the only di&s;tinctions are the quantity worn, and the colouring; the lower cla&s;s of people wearing only one &s;ingle garment; the better &s;ort as many as were they made of broad-cloth would burden them to carry. One thing, however, appears &s;ingular; when they &s;alute one another, they con&s;tantly unbare them&s;elves from the wai&s;t upwards, throwing off their tunics, as we may call them, with the &s;ame ea&s;e and for the &s;ame purpo&s;e as we pull off our hats. This &s;alutation is common to the women as well as the men, and is the univer&s;al practice.</P>
<P>9. Their arts may be reduced to five, name|ly, architecture, carving, &s;hip-building, navi|gation, and painting; yet, for any thing that appears to the contrary, they are all directed by the &s;ame cla&s;s of men, who, like the druids of old, are prie&s;ts, philo&s;ophers, and arti&s;ts. Of their architecture, however, there is but one remarkable &s;pecimen exi&s;ting in the great|er-i&s;land; and not many in the le&s;&s;er. This building is the Moral, or &s;epulchral monument of Oborea, of whom mention has already been made in the cour&s;e of this narrative. It is in|deed prodigious; it is a pile of &s;tone 267 feet
<PB N="213" REF="226">
long and 87 wide at the ba&s;e, rai&s;ed by flights of &s;teps to the height of 44 feet; the&s;e &s;teps are each four feet high, narrowing gra|dually, till they end in a &s;mall entablature, on which near the middle &s;tands the figure of a bird carved in wood, and at a proper di&s;tance the broken fragments of a fi&s;h cut in &s;tone. This pile makes a con&s;iderable part of one &s;ide of a &s;quare court, who&s;e area is 360 feet by 354, inclo&s;ed within a wall of &s;tone, and paved with the &s;ame meterials through its whole ex|tent. As this &s;quare is &s;urrounded with trees, and has many growing within it of a particu|lar kind, it forms at a di&s;tance the mo&s;t de|lightful grove that imagination can paint. At what time it was erected could not be learnt, for they have no records of pa&s;t tran&s;actions; but being con&s;tructed of coral &s;tones, many of them of large dimen&s;ions, neatly &s;quared and poli&s;hed, and &s;o nicely joined as hardly to di&s;|cover a &s;eam, it mu&s;t fill the mind of a nice ob&s;erver with rapture to examine all its parts. To think how &s;uch a ma&s;s of materials could be brought together in an i&s;land where no quar|ries are to be found; how the&s;e materials could be cut with &s;uch exactne&s;s, as to form a pile impenetrable by rain, without cement, and that with tools le&s;s hard than the material to which they were applied; and la&s;tly, how the&s;e enormous blocks of &s;tone could afterwards be
<PB N="214" REF="227">
rai&s;ed to the height of 44 feet to clo&s;e and co|ver in the building, mu&s;t &s;urely excite the won|der of every ordinary beholder; but to mark the &s;ymmetry of the whole, &s;o ju&s;tly proportioned in every part as to di&s;play the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate judgment, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the rules of art, mu&s;t afford a fea&s;t to an enligh|tened mind, of which an ordinary &s;eaman can have no reli&s;h. This noble &s;tructure, though &s;ingle, is &s;uch a proof of genius as will remain the admiration of the world, as long perhaps as the i&s;land it&s;elf endures; for being &s;olid, without a cavity, no time that will not equally affect the i&s;land will ever de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Of their carving in &s;tone there are but few &s;pecimens to be produced, and indeed when their tools they have to work with are con&s;ider|ed, it is more to be admired that there are any, than that there are &s;o few; but there is rea&s;on to hope that now they are made acquainted with the u&s;e of iron, and have con&s;iderable quantities of that metal among&s;t them, that their improvements will &s;peedily be propor|tioned to their advantages. Of their carving in wood, there is hardly a tool or ordinary uten|&s;il of any kind that does not di&s;cover evident proofs of their expertne&s;s in that art. Their ve&s;&s;els for navigation are all adorned with it; and in &s;ome of their performances of that kind there is an excellence di&s;cernible, that with &s;uch
<PB N="215" REF="228">
tools as they have to work with no European carver could exceed.</P>
<P>With regard to their &s;hip-building little can be &s;aid, but that they are upon a footing with their neighbours. Their ve&s;&s;els are well enough fitted to the &s;eas they have to navigate; and there is hardly an in&s;tance of any of them being ca&s;t away: they are mo&s;t of them elevated at the head and &s;tern, for the purpo&s;e of defend|ing the rowers from the &s;urf, which on the&s;e i&s;|lands breaks upon the &s;hore with uncommon violence; tho&s;e of Otaheite are in form not unlike the punt-boats, with flat bottoms, u&s;ed by our fi&s;hermen up the river Thames, or ra|ther like tho&s;e u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e on the Severn: they are no where wider than three feet, though &s;ome of them are more than 60 feet long; nor are they an inch deeper in the body, though at the head and &s;tern, they ri&s;e with a curvature more than 12 feet. As it would be impo&s;&s;ible to navigate the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, &s;o long and &s;o narrow, without &s;ome contrivance to keep them upright, they place two of them as near as can be of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, along &s;ide of each other, at three, four, or five feet di&s;tance, and with &s;trong &s;pars join them toge|ther; then rai&s;ing a ma&s;t in each, they hoi&s;t a &s;quare &s;ail, the yards of which are fa&s;tened above and below to the corre&s;ponding ma&s;ts, and thus equipt, with a cabin erected between

them to &s;tow their provi&s;ions, they will keep the &s;ea for &s;everal days. Their ordinary fi&s;h|ing canoes are in nothing different from the boats that boys make, except in their &s;ize, and that a flat board projects a foot or two before, narrowing to a point, and the &s;ame again in the &s;tern. In rigging their double canoes, they have a rule for proportioning the height of the ma&s;ts to the length of the keel, and of fitting the &s;ail to the height of the ma&s;t: they likewi&s;e have a contrivance of &s;ailing in &s;ingle canoes, by means of outriggers, which project on the lee-&s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and prevents their over-&s;et|ting; to this outrigger one corner of the &s;ail is made fa&s;t, which &s;ail being wide at bottom, and rounding to a point a-top, very much re&s;em|bles what the boatmen call a &s;houlder of mut|ton &s;ail, and which is not unfrequently &s;een on the river Thames. To tho&s;e who have been told that the ma&s;on can joint &s;tone with &s;o much nicety as to be impervious to water, it will not &s;eem &s;trange that their carpenters can do the &s;ame with re&s;pect to timber, yet it certain|ly mu&s;t require much art and incredible labour, fir&s;t to fell the tree, then to cleave it out into planks, then to hollow it out to the intended &s;hape; next to &s;mooth and poli&s;h it, after that to joint it, and la&s;t of all to put it together, and &s;aw it, for they were wholly ignorant of the art of bolting it with wooden bolts, or joint|ing
<PB N="217" REF="230">
it together by means of mortices, till the Europeans vi&s;ited them. It is no wonder therefore that they dreaded nothing &s;o much as the de&s;truction of their boats when threat|ened by the Engli&s;h for any offence, nor that they are more careful in covering their boat-hou&s;es from the &s;un and rain, than they are in &s;ecuring their dwellings from the &s;ame injury.</P>
<P>As their whole art of navigation depends upon their minutely ob&s;erving the motions of the heavenly bodies, it is a&s;toni&s;hing with what exactne&s;s their navigators can de&s;cribe the mo|tions and changes of tho&s;e luminaries. There was not a &s;tar in their hemi&s;phere fixt or erra|tic but Toobia could give a name to, tell when and where it would appear and di&s;appear; and what was &s;till more wonderful, could foretell from the a&s;pect of the heavens the changes of the wind, and the alterations of the weather, &s;everal days before they happened. By this intelligence he had been enabled to vi&s;it mo&s;t of the i&s;lands for many degrees round that of which he was a native. By the &s;un they &s;teer in the day, and by the &s;tars they &s;teer in the night; and by their &s;kill in pre&s;aging the weather, they can without danger lengthen or &s;horten their voyage as appearances are for or again&s;t them. As they have no medium wherewith to trade, their voyages &s;eem wholly calculated for di&s;covery, or to increa&s;e their
<PB N="218" REF="231">
acquaintance one nation with another. Riches they do not &s;eem &s;ollicitous to acquire, as riches confer no di&s;tinction on the owner; and yet, without &s;uch a motive, it is not ea&s;y to conceive what prompts one to take away what another has in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They certainly in|terchange their commodities among them&s;elves as well as with &s;trangers: the fi&s;herman bar|ters his fi&s;h for the planter's bread-fruit, and &s;o of the re&s;t; yet every man &s;eems to be a fi&s;herman, and every man a planter: this &s;hews that we are &s;till &s;trangers to their civil oecono|my. It had been good policy to have &s;uffered two or three young fellows who were de&s;irous of &s;taying behind, to have &s;ettled among them, e&s;pecially as there was rea&s;on to believe that the i&s;land would again be vi&s;ited, if for no other rea&s;on but to re&s;tore to them the native who had voluntarily undertaken a voyage to Europe; but again&s;t this it &s;eems the officers very carefully guarded.</P>
<P>Their painting appears to be in a rude &s;tate, and chiefly confined to the figures repre&s;ented on their bodies, and the ornaments on their ve&s;&s;els of navigation. The figures repre&s;ented on their bodies are generally tho&s;e of birds and fi&s;hes, &s;ometimes after nature, and &s;ometimes the creatures of the arti&s;t's fancy; but what|ever is repre&s;ented, the outline is traced with a&s;toni&s;hing exactne&s;s. This art is &s;olely con|fined
<PB N="219" REF="232">
to the prie&s;thood, and is performed like bapti&s;m as a rite, without which, after a cer|tain age, none are accounted worthy of &s;ociety. From twelve to fourteen is the period allotted for the performance of this rite, for before that age the children are thought unable to endure the &s;mart.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of painting in u&s;e among the&s;e i&s;landers may rather be called daubing, con&s;i&s;ting only in colouring the rude carvings in their plea&s;ure-boats, &amp;c. &s;ometimes with one colour, and &s;ometimes with another, but mo&s;t commonly with red.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the arts in this celebrated i&s;land, which, had Toobia lived to have come to England, and to have returned again to his own country, would no doubt have received a rapid improvement, for he was a man of real genius, a prie&s;t of the fir&s;t order, and an excellent arti&s;t: he was, how|ever, by no means beloved by the Endea|vour's crew, being looked upon as proud and au&s;tere, extorting homage, which the &s;ailors who thought them&s;elves degraded by bending to an Indian, were very unwilling to pay, and preferring complaints again&s;t them on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions. On the contrary, his boy Tayota was the darling of the &s;hip's com|pany from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, being of a mild and docile di&s;po&s;ition, ready to do any
<PB N="220" REF="233">
kind office for the meane&s;t in the &s;hip, and never complaining, but always plea&s;ed. His death at Batavia was much lamented.</P>
<P>10. Their manufactures are of various kinds; but that of cloth is in the highe&s;t e&s;ti|mation among&s;t them: why, indeed, it &s;hould be called cloth no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned but that it is worn by the natives as clothing; for, as a manufacture, it has no one proce&s;s &s;imilar to that which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of cloth. The material of which it is made is neither &s;pun nor woven in a loom, but in every re&s;pect is prepared after the fir&s;t &s;imple manner of making paper before mills were applied to facilitate the labour. The bark is fir&s;t &s;tript from the tree and laid in the water, as we do flax to &s;oak; it is then di|ve&s;ted of the rind by &s;craping, till only the fibres of the in&s;ide remain. When it is pro|perly clean&s;ed it is then placed upon leaves, one layer by the &s;ide of another, till it is of &s;ufficient breadth; and in the &s;ame manner it is extended to what length the manufacturer chu&s;es, or the ground will admit: to &s;trengthen it, and increa&s;e its breadth, one layer is laid over another tll it is of the &s;ub&s;tance required. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> is left to drain, and when it is ju&s;t dry enough to be rai&s;ed from the ground, it is then placed upon a kind of &s;tage made of &s;mooth boards, and beat with a &s;quare bearer
<PB N="221" REF="234">
about a foot long, and two or three inches broad. On each of the four &s;ides of this beater parallel lines are cut lengthwi&s;e; the&s;e lines differ in finene&s;s, in a proportion from a &s;mall twine to a &s;ilken thread. They fir&s;t be|gin with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;ide of the beater, and fini&s;h with the fine&s;t. By the continued appli|cation of this beater, in which two people are generally employed, who &s;tand oppo&s;ite to each other on each &s;ide the &s;tage, and regulate their &s;trokes like &s;miths on an anvil, the cloth, if cloth it mu&s;t be called, in its rough &s;tate thins apace, and as it thins it increa&s;es in breadth. When it has undergone this proce&s;s, it is then &s;pread out to whiten, and when &s;ufficiently whitened it then becomes the ladies province carefully to look it over, and to remove all blemi&s;hes. Thus far compleated, it is colour|ed, generally red or yellow; and when that is done, it is rolled up, and laid by for u&s;e. By this de&s;cription the reader will readily compre|hend in what manner the fabric may be varied into fine or cour&s;e, according to the materials of which it is made, and the labour be&s;towed upon it. In Ottaheite the bark of three dif|ferent trees is made u&s;e of in this manufacture; the Chine&s;e-paper-mulberry, the bread-fruit|tree, and the wild fig-tree. Of the fir&s;t and &s;econd the fine&s;t &s;orts are made; but of the la&s;t, the mo&s;t durable. The fir&s;t and &s;econd
<PB N="222" REF="235">
imbibe water like paper; but the latter will re&s;i&s;t the rain. They have a method of wa&s;h|ing this cloth after being worn; but when it is wa&s;hed, it is again beaten; by this la&s;t pro|ce&s;s it is rendered very &s;oft and pliable.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable manufacture is that of matting, made likewi&s;e of the rinds of plants and &s;hrubs, which are manufactured to a de|gree of finene&s;s not to be equalled by any thing of the kind known in Europe. Of this ma|nufacture they make their &s;ails to their &s;hip|ping, the coverings of their beds, and even their cloathing in rainy weather. They make this matting with a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Their cordage is another con&s;iderable arti|cle, which is made of the rind of a plant not unlike a wild nettle. In this manufacture they likewi&s;e excel, but we do not learn that any of it was purcha&s;ed for the &s;hip's u&s;e. Their lines made for fi&s;hing are much &s;uperior to any thing u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e in Europe, being &s;tronger and infinitely more durable. Their fi&s;hing-nets have the &s;ame advantages; but the cords made of human hair, which the ladies wind round their heads, and which like netting here, is the chief amu&s;ement of the la|dies there, is incomparably beyond any thing that can be conceived in twi&s;ting. Mr. Banks is &s;aid to have in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;pecimen of it, near two thou&s;and yards in length, as fine as
<PB N="223" REF="236">
the fine&s;t &s;ilk-thread, and without a knot; nei|ther have they any engine to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the performance, but all is done by hand, and with a quickne&s;s that almo&s;t exceeds belief.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a manufacture of ba&s;ket, or wicker-work, of which every native is a pro|ficient; and as they have a kind of emulation in excelling in this manufacture, it is not to be wondered at, that there &s;hould be as many different forms, as there are different makers, &s;ome of them incomparably neat. But among the curio&s;ities of this kind, that which was mo&s;t admired by the Europeans, was the figure of a man upwards of &s;even feet high, repre|&s;ented in ba&s;ket-work.
"This wicker-&s;keleton, (&s;ays the writer of the Endeavour's Voyage,) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was compleatly covered with feathers, white where the &s;kin was to appear, and black in tho&s;e parts which it is their cu&s;tom to paint or &s;tain, and upon the head, where there was to be a repre&s;entation of hair: Upon the head al&s;o were four protuberances, three in front, and one behind, which the natives called tate-ete, or little men."</Q>
This, it &s;eems was a repre&s;entation of one of their dei|ties.</P>
<P>Other manufactures of le&s;s account are their weapons of war, which &s;eem to be the work|man&s;hip of the owners, their fi&s;hing-tackle of various &s;orts, their working-tools, and their
<PB N="224" REF="237">
jewelery; in the latter of which they di&s;play no great ingenuity.</P>
<P>11. Come we now to their civil govern|ment, of which, however, we have no di&s;tinct idea. By what indeed we can gather from the relations already made public, there &s;eems to be a remarkable conformity between their e&s;|tabli&s;hment, and that of the antient Britons, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal &s;mall nations, under &s;o many petty princes or chiefs, who in ca&s;es of common danger united under one head. The&s;e chiefs had all of them their re&s;pective families, who multiplying, became a di&s;tinct cla&s;s from the common or lower &s;ort of people, and exerci&s;ed an unlimited authority over them. Of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, added to that of the prie&s;thood, the whole body of the people con&s;i&s;ted, &s;o that among them, what one cla&s;s found nece&s;&s;ary to command, the other was ready to execute. Hence it was that indu&s;try took place, and arts were invented; and this &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the i&s;landers, of whom we are now &s;peaking. Laws they had none, but &s;uch as naturally aro&s;e from the idea of &s;uperiority and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as ex|cite parents to corect the faults of their chil|dren; neither have the Ottaheiteans any other at this day. There is no crime among them that &s;ubjects a man to death, and when life is taken away, it is always in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="225" REF="238">
or re&s;entment, and not the effect of formal ac|cu&s;ation and deliberate puni&s;hment. The con|tentions that aro&s;e among the chiefs, like the quarrels of neighbouring &s;chools, became the quarrels of the whole community; and the&s;e quarrels nece&s;&s;arily led the parties to have re|cour&s;e to arms, and in proportion as the con|tentions grew more frequent, the weapons that were contrived for defence, grew more de&s;pe|rate. It was not, however, till after civiliza|tion began to take place, that contentions for liberty began to &s;pread deva&s;tation among peo|ple of the &s;ame community. In their primary &s;tate of &s;ubjection, the people never entertain|ed a thought that they were in &s;lavery; they obeyed as children do their parents, from a principle originating in nature, which teaches the weak to &s;ubmit to the &s;trong, and tho&s;e of mean under&s;tanding to be governed by tho&s;e who&s;e wi&s;dom they tacitly acknowledge. This appears to be a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of civil government in Ottaheite, where none think them&s;elves &s;laves, yet few are free.</P>
<P>Concerning their religion, the little infor|mation we have received is &s;o vague and con|tradictory, that nothing can with certainty be &s;aid about it. We are told that they have idols, and yet are no idolaters; that they have places of wor&s;hip, but that they never a&s;&s;emble to pay adoration; that they acknowledge deities
<PB N="226" REF="239">
of &s;everal orders, but that they have no forms of addre&s;&s;ing them. They have prie&s;ts like|wi&s;e of &s;everal orders, who have different of|fices a&s;&s;igned, but few of tho&s;e offices are par|ticularized, except that they pre&s;ide and pray at funerals, and are the principal attendants at their Morais, or Temples; though it does not appear that any ceremonies of devotion are performed there. The offices that have been ob&s;erved as appertaining to the prie&s;thood, are three, namely, circumci&s;ing, tattowing, and praying at the funerals of the dead; that of circumci&s;ing is not performed after the man|ner of the Jews, but after a peculiar manner of their own; and has no doubt the purity of the circumci&s;ed for its object, in bringing every part about them into contact with the water with which they con&s;tantly wa&s;h three times a day. Tattowing, whatever its object, is never omitted; and praying for the dead is certain|ly a proof that they believe in the &s;ouls exi&s;ting in a &s;eparate &s;tate, after it has taken its &s;light from the body, which, it &s;hould &s;eem by their pla|cing meat and drink in their burying places, they do not think immediately takes place.</P>
<P>In this cu&s;tom, however, they are far from being &s;ingular; in the infancy of almo&s;t every &s;tate &s;omething of the like kind may be traced. Among the antient Romans, they placed meat upon the tombs of their decea&s;ed friends, that
<PB N="227" REF="240">
the gho&s;ts might come out and eat, as they fancied they would; and when they intended to expre&s;s the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of human wretchedne&s;s, they u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>&s;uch a creature gets his food from the tombs.</HI></P>
<P>The character of the Tahowa of the Otta|heiteans very nearly corre&s;ponds with that of Druid, among the Britons. The Tahowa is the chief prie&s;t, of which, however, there are &s;everal orders, as has already been remarked, who&s;e erudition con&s;i&s;ts in learning the &s;everal traditional memorials of antient times; in be|ing made acquainted with the opinion of their ance&s;tors, concerning the origin of things; and in the repetition of many myterious &s;en|tences, in a language which the vulgar do not under&s;tand. This, perhaps, might be thought a fiction founded on the Popi&s;h cu&s;tom of pray|ing in an unknown tongue, were it not that the Brahmins in the Ea&s;t have their my&s;tic language, as have likewi&s;e all the followers of the great Zoroa&s;ter. The prie&s;ts are &s;uperior too to the re&s;t of the people in the knowledge of navigation and a&s;tronomy, and in all the li|beral arts, of which the&s;e people have any idea. Thus far the character of the Tahowa agrees with that of the Druid, in every particular. Sir William Temple, whom we have already quoted, &s;ays, the Druids were the only per|&s;ons of any &s;ort of learning in the&s;e nations,
<PB N="228" REF="241">
which was derived by long tradition among them, and con&s;i&s;ted in the ob&s;ervation of the heavens, knowledge of the &s;tars and their cour&s;es, and thereby the pre&s;agers of many events, &amp;c. that they had the care and direc|tion of all religious matters, and that their au|thority was ab&s;olute. And Rapin adds, that the chief of the Druids was a &s;ort of pontiff, or high-prie&s;t, who had authority over all the re&s;t, and who&s;e dignity was elective. It would be no unplea&s;ing ta&s;k to trace the conformity of the cu&s;toms and manners of nations remote from one another in their infant &s;tate, were it not foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s we have in hand, which however furni&s;hes the materials for &s;uch an enquiry, which the writer may one day or other take the pains to arrange.</P>
<P>In the mean time we &s;hall take our leave of the Ottaheiteans, by a brief account of their funeral ceremonies, that being the only &s;olem|nity in which the prie&s;t and the people jointly a&s;&s;i&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"As &s;oon as a native of Ottaheite is known to be dead, the hou&s;e, &s;ays the writer of the Endeavour's voyage, is filled with rela|tions, who deplore their lo&s;s, &s;ome by loud lamentations, and &s;ome by le&s;s clamorous, but more genuine expre&s;&s;ions of grief. Tho&s;e who are in the neare&s;t degree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are &s;ilent; the re&s;t are one moment uttering pa&s;&s;ionate exclama|tions
<PB N="229" REF="242">
in a chorus, and the next laughing and talking, without the lea&s;t appearance of con|cern:"</Q> and here we cannot help remarking, that this de&s;cription is equally applicable to the wild Iri&s;h, as to the people for whom it was written, for no de&s;cription can be nearer the tRuth. <Q REND="inline">"This &s;olemnity, the writer adds, is continued only for a day and a night;"</Q> but among the Iri&s;h it is continued for &s;everal nights. "On the next morning the body is &s;hrouded, and conveyed to the &s;ea-&s;ide upon a bier, which the bearers &s;upport upon their &s;houlders, attended by the prie&s;t, who having prayed over the body, repeats his &s;entences during the proce&s;&s;ion. When it arrives at the water's edge it is &s;et down upon the beach, the prie&s;t renews his prayers, and taking up &s;ome of the water in his hand &s;prinkles it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back 40 or 50 yards, and &s;oon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and &s;prinkling are repeated. It is thus removed backwards and forwards &s;everal times; and while the&s;e ceremonies have been performing, a hou&s;e has been built, and a &s;mall piece of ground railed round, in the centre of which a &s;tage is erected on which they place the bier, and the body is there left to putrify, till the fle&s;h is wa&s;ted from the bones. As &s;oon as the body is depo&s;ited the mourning is renew|ed,
<PB N="230" REF="243">
the women a&s;&s;emble, and are led to the door by the neare&s;t relation, who &s;trikes a &s;hark's tooth &s;everal times into the crown of her head; the blood copiou&s;ly follows, and is carefully receiv|ed upon pieces of linen, [probably upon pieces of their un&s;ullied white cloth, for linen they had none before the Europeans vi&s;ited them] which are thrown under the bier. The re&s;t of the women follow this example, and the cere|mony is repeated at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and &s;otrow of the parties hold out. The tears al&s;o which are &s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions are received upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead; &s;ome of the younger people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other offerings. "This cu&s;tom, adds the writer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is founded on the notion that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed is hovering about the place where the body is depo&s;ited; that it ob&s;erves the actions of the &s;urvivors, and is gratified by &s;uch te&s;timonies of their affec|tion and grief."</Q>
But whether this is their belief or the writer's is very problematical; neither is it certain that the prie&s;t is an attend|ant in the proce&s;&s;ion of the decea&s;ed to the water's edge; for in the funerals at which Mr. Banks was a party no mention is made of a prie&s;t; and Tuberai Tumaide, who was chief mourner, is &s;aid to have pronounced the fune|ral
<PB N="231" REF="244">
&s;ervice, whatever that &s;ervice might be. The natives are all &s;aid to fly before the&s;e pro|ce&s;&s;ions, and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, the chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat &s;tick, the edge of which is &s;et with &s;harks teeth, and in a phren&s;y, which his grief is &s;uppo&s;ed to have in&s;pired, he runs at all he &s;ees, and if any of them happen to be overtaken, he &s;trikes them mo&s;t unmercifully with his indented cudgel, which cannot fail to wound them in a dangerous manner. But this rea&s;on, though a plau&s;ible one, does not &s;eem to come up to what is &s;aid occa&s;ionally in the cour&s;e of the relation, that while the corp&s;e is carrying in proce&s;&s;ion the people every where fly and hide them&s;elves in the woods, and that none but tho&s;e immediately concerned in it, if they can avoid it, come in &s;ight. Were it only for fear of the cudgel that the&s;e people fled, they needed not run &s;o far as the woods, nor to quit their hou&s;es, (as Mr. Banks ob&s;erved they did when the corp&s;e of an old woman who&s;e fune|ral he attended came by in proce&s;&s;ion) to hide them&s;elves in holes; it would have been &s;uf|ficient for them to have kept out of the reach of the cudgel; but they mu&s;t be awed by &s;ome &s;ecret motive; &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious dread of &s;ome misfortune happening to them if they &s;hould meet the corp&s;e, either in an unlucky place, or in an ominous &s;ituation; as at this
<PB N="232" REF="245">
day many people in the northern parts of Bri|tain get out of the way of a corp&s;e when carry|ing to the grave for the&s;e or the like rea&s;ons. The&s;e people are certainly not intimidated by the apprehen&s;ion of being beaten; but they have a dread upon them of they know not what; yet it is &s;uch a dread as in&s;en&s;ibly im|pells them to keep at a di&s;tance; and if by accident they are &s;urpri&s;ed, and meet the corp&s;e at the corner of a &s;treet, or the round|ing of a hill, they never fail to ble&s;s them|&s;elves, and to turn the way the corp&s;e is carry|ing, and walk in the &s;ame direction for &s;everal paces to avert the bad effects of the unlucky omen, which they always interpret again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Parkin&s;on's account of the funeral ceremo|nies of the i&s;landers in the South-Seas is le&s;s laboured than the writer's we have above quot|ed, but is more natural; he was indeed an eye|witne&s;s of what he wrote, and therefore judged from what he &s;aw, not from what was reported to him. He tells us, that the prie&s;t, accompa|nied with two boys painted black, attend at the Morai, or place where the corp&s;e is depo&s;ited to receive the hogs, fi&s;h, and other provi&s;ions, which on the&s;e occa&s;ions are offered to the Ethooa or deity of the place, and to lay them upon an altar; that this prie&s;t and his attend|ants are employed in &s;trewing the body of the
<PB N="233" REF="246">
defunct with leaves and flowers of bamboo; that for two or three days he occasionally ranges the adjacent fields and woods, from which every one retires on his approach. The relations, in the mean time, build a temporary hou&s;e near the Morai, where they a&s;&s;emble, and the females mourn for the decea&s;ed by &s;inging &s;ongs of grief, howling, and wounding their bodies in different places with &s;harks teeth; after which they bathe their wounds in the next river or &s;ea, and again return to howl and cut them&s;elves, which they continue for three days. After the body is corrupted, and the bones are become bare, the &s;keleton is de|po&s;ited in a &s;ort of &s;tone-pyramid built for that purpo&s;e. He adds, that the&s;e Morais are fre|quented by two birds &s;acred to their gods, namely, the gray heron, and a blue and brown king-fi&s;her; but whether the&s;e birds, or the prie&s;t and his attendants eat the offerings that are made to the pre&s;iding deity, or whether they are eaten at all, is not declared. It is agreed, however, that the piety of the natives is in no in&s;tance &s;o &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed as in the profu&s;ion of covering they be&s;tow upon the remains of their decea&s;ed friends, and in the ornaments with which they decorate their Mo|rais; but the&s;e Morais are not the receptacles of the ordinary dead, but appropriated &s;olely to the u&s;e of the principal families to which
<PB N="234" REF="247">
each re&s;pectively belongs; how it fares with the bodies of the common herd we are not told, whether they are &s;uffered to rot upon the ground, or under it, does not attract the notice of the voyager, who is only intent upon what is &s;triking in high life, without regarding the ordinary occurrences that daily pa&s;s among the multitude.</P>
<P>15. It does not appear that they have either phy&s;icians or &s;urgeons, by profe&s;&s;ion, among them, except the prie&s;t, who&s;e relief con&s;i&s;ts in prayers and ceremonies, not in drugs or pre&s;criptions; yet we mu&s;t not conclude from hence that they are deficient in the art of heal|ing. Two or three in&s;tances occur in the re|lations of different voyagers, which are &s;tri|king proofs of their knowledge in what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve life. Toopia was pierced through the body with a lance, headed with the jagged bone of the &s;ting-ray; the weapon went in at his back and came out ju&s;t under his brea&s;t, yet he was perfectly cured, and never complained of any inconvenience from the bad effects of his wound. A man who&s;e head was almo&s;t cru&s;hed, his face beat in, his no&s;e flatted, and one eye beat out, the hollow of which would almo&s;t admit one's fi&s;t; yet this man was cured, and to appearance felt no re|maining pain; a third had a &s;tone drove through his head with a &s;ling in the wars, and
<PB N="235" REF="248">
yet, how improbable &s;oever it may &s;eem, he, like the others, appeared to enjoy a good &s;tate of health. The&s;e are inconte&s;tible proofs of their knowledge of the virtues of bal&s;ams, of which we are either not po&s;&s;e&s;t, or are igno|rant of their healing qualities.</P>
<P>From this brief account of the i&s;land and people of Otaheite, many will be ready to envy them their felicity; but it mu&s;t be remember|ed, as a foil to their happine&s;s, that they do not always &s;leep in &s;ecurity; they are frequent|ly &s;urprized by their more warlike neighbours, and whole di&s;tricts depopulated; for, if in the inva&s;ions of one another's territories, they hap|pen to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, they &s;pare neither man, woman, nor child.&mdash;But to return:</P>
<P>On the 14th of May we left the &s;hip under &s;ail, and that night &s;he cleared the reef.</P>
<P>On the 15th they had an open &s;ea and a fine breeze in their favour; but ju&s;t as the &s;hip's canvas was &s;preading, one of the officers from the gun-room ports, ob&s;erved a per&s;on in the water, making from the &s;hip towards the land; they immediately hove to, and hoi&s;ted out the large cutter, armed her, and &s;ent her after the man, who proved to be the gunner's mate, en|deavouring to e&s;cape with a view to be left be|hind; and pity it was that he happened to be di&s;covered, as from him a more copious and accurate account of the religion and civil go|vernment

of the&s;e people might have been ex|pected after a few years &s;tay among them, than could po&s;&s;ibly be collected from a few &s;hort vi|&s;its, by gentlemen who had the language to learn, and who&s;e fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to procure nece&s;&s;aries, in order to enable them to pur&s;ue more important di&s;coveries. But this attempt failing, and the man taken up, he was brought back, and laid in irons to bewail his ill-for|tune, having flattered him&s;elf, as a man of en|terprize and courage, with being made king of the country, or at lea&s;t prime mini&s;ter. No impediment now remaining the &s;hip pur&s;ued her cour&s;e to the N. W. and N. W. by W. having four of the natives of Ottaheite on board as pa&s;&s;engers to Huaheiney, to which &s;he was bound, and where &s;he ca&s;t anchor the &s;ame night. Here the captain was welcomed by king Oree, who came on board before the &s;hip was well moored, bringing with him a hog as a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the 16th abundance of canoes came along &s;ide the &s;hip to trade, bringing hogs, fowls, and fruit of various &s;orts, to barter for &s;uch things as were &s;hewn them, of which each cho&s;e what he thought was mo&s;t valuable, ac|cording to the price that was &s;et upon it. But while the greate&s;t part of the people were enga|ged in traffic, &s;ome were employed in an at|tempt to carry off one of the &s;hip's buoys;
<PB N="237" REF="250">
the&s;e, however, were di&s;covered before they had accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign, were fired upon, and for &s;afety obliged to jump into the &s;ea, leaving their canoe behind them, which by way of puni&s;hment, was taken on board, and cut up for the u&s;e of the cooks. This day the captain and gentlemen went on &s;hore to pay their compliments to the king and his nobles, and Mr. Fo&s;ter went up the country to exa|mine its productions. This he continued as a daily ta&s;k during the &s;hip's continuance in this harbour. While he was thus employed, &s;ome of the other gentlemen and officers went up into the woods a-&s;hooting, and the captain em|ployed him&s;elf in laying in provi&s;ions and in|crea&s;ing the &s;hip's &s;tores.</P>
<P>On the 16th the number of inhabitants that came about the &s;hip was &s;o great, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to place &s;entinels in the gang|ways, to prevent the men from coming on board, but no oppo&s;ition was made to the wo|men, &s;o that the &s;hip was crouded with them.</P>
<P>17. King Oree came and dined on board, and the captain ordered the guns to be &s;hotted, and fired by way of &s;alute at his entrance and departure; he had given the captain to under|stand that he expected the &s;ame honours to be paid to him, as had been &s;hewn to the chiefs of Ottaheite.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="251">18. A report was current, that the natives intended to ri&s;e and attack the &s;hip. The cap|tain, though he did not think them &s;erious in &s;uch an attempt, yet was unwilling totally to di&s;regard the intimation; he therefore ordered 20 &s;tand of arms to be in readine&s;s in ca&s;e any commotion &s;hould be ob&s;erved among them.</P>
<P>19. The rumour increa&s;ed, but no prepara|tions could be ob&s;erved to countenance &s;uch a report; the king continued his vi&s;its as u&s;ual, and never came empty handed.</P>
<P>20. The fir&s;t and &s;econd lieutenants, and one of the mates being a duck &s;hooting, were &s;et upon by a party of the people con&s;i&s;ting of more than 50, who fir&s;t diverted them of their arms, and then robbed them of what articles they had carried with them to trade; in the &s;cuffle the fir&s;t lieutenant lo&s;t the &s;kirt of his coat, and one of the other gentlemen received a &s;evere blow. When the party had &s;tripped them of their merchandizes, they re&s;tored to them their fowling-pieces, and &s;uffered them to make the be&s;t of their way on board, where king Oree happened to be fea&s;ting; they com|plained of the in&s;ult, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;atisfac|tion for the lo&s;s; he told them that it was not in his power to puni&s;h the party that had com|mitted the robbery, they being out of his ju|ri&s;diction; but he offered to head any number of the &s;hip's company that &s;hould be thought
<PB N="239" REF="252">
able to reduce them, and would &s;hew them the way to their place of re&s;idence, which of|fer, being thought rea&s;onable, was accepted; but at the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;ured them, that the&s;e men were not afraid of their guns, as they had frequently &s;een them mi&s;s fire.</P>
<P>21. The captain and officers made ready to accompany king Oree in the expedition again&s;t the robbers; and having ordered fifty marines with &s;ome &s;ailors to be well armed, they landed near the palace of the king, and having required him to conduct them accord|ing to his promi&s;e, he very readily con&s;ented, and they all &s;et out together; and, having marched for more than ten miles, they at length came to a high hill, which parted the dominions of Oree from tho&s;e of the king who&s;e &s;ubjects they were who committed the robbery, and over which they were to pa&s;s be|fore they could approach them. Here they found the a&s;cent very &s;teep, and very fa|tiguing; but when they had reached the &s;um|mit, the king &s;hewed them the re&s;idence of the robbers at &s;ome di&s;tance in the valley on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hill, and left it to the cap|tain's choice, either to proceed, or to return back. Obadee, the volunteer Indian, who had accompanied the captain in his former voyage to the South, very earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded him from proceeding, by telling him that they
<PB N="240" REF="253">
wanted only to decoy him; that there was no acce&s;s to tho&s;e Indians but through a &s;teep and narrow pa&s;s, in which two men only could go a-brea&s;t, and that there they could de&s;troy them with &s;tones while their fire-arms could be of little or no u&s;e. This hone&s;t repre&s;enta|tion having its weight, the captain gave over the pur&s;uit, and the whole party returned, &s;uf|ficiently chagrined with their day's exploit. In the mean time, the people that were left on board had loaded all their guns great and &s;mall, to be prepared in ca&s;e of an attack from the &s;hore in the ab&s;ence of their commander and his followers: but all things remaining quiet, the captain returned on board, and with him his a&s;&s;ociate king Oree, who brought with him a hog for dinner ready dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>22. The inhabitants &s;till continuing to trade, and the launch and boats to bring in wood and water, the captain gave orders to put to &s;ea, the quantity of water being already compleat, and the wood though &s;hort, not ea&s;ily to be recruited.</P>
<P>23. King Oree came on board, and after mu|tual pre&s;ents had been exchanged, and many demon&s;trations of affection and friend&s;hip &s;hewn on the part of his maje&s;ty, he took his leave, weeping as if he had been parting from his kingdom. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e people, who, whether real or counter|feit,
<PB N="241" REF="254">
have a forcible way of expre&s;&s;ing &s;orrow, which never fails to make a &s;uitable impre&s;&s;ion. But, while the chiefs were with &s;ome reluc|tance di&s;patched, it was not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k to clear the &s;hip from the impertinences of the women; they all wanted pre&s;ents before they departed, and when they were driven up one hatchway they ran down another, crying and bellowing as if nothing but ruin attended their return to &s;hore. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, indeed, but that if they returned empty handed, they might meet with a cool reception from their old friends and connections, and that the fear of being de&s;pi&s;ed for not making a better mar|ket might induce them to be &s;o incorrigibly trouble&s;ome: however, when things came to the la&s;t extremity, and they &s;aw the &s;hip un|moored, and the &s;ails &s;pread, they betook them&s;elves quietly to their canoes, though they afterwards made a terrible bellowing as they rowed away.</P>
<P>24. They arrived at Ulietea without any thing remarkable intervening, except that Mara, the gunner's mate, who had been laid in irons for endeavouring to make his e&s;cape on &s;hore at the &s;hip's departure from Otta|heite, was relea&s;ed from his irons, and made pri&s;oner at large, with a &s;entinel to attend him; but on his arrival in port he was again put in irons.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="255">25. The captain went a&s;hore and vi&s;ited the king and royal family. The queen, upon &s;eeing him, in&s;tanly fell into a fit of phren&s;y, &s;triking her&s;elf with a &s;hark's tooth till the blood run from her in &s;treams. It is the cu&s;|tom to do this both when they rejoice, and when they mean to expre&s;s grief. It was the &s;udden tran&s;port of joy that impelled her on this occa&s;ion; and &s;he received the captain, af|ter the blood was done away, with open arms. After a &s;hort &s;tay, which exhibited a &s;cene of mutual care&s;&s;es, the captain returned on board with the queen, and a beautiful young prince&s;s, her daughter, in company. They were &s;carce on board when all the young girls in the bay were ready to enter, and it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep out the men to avoid confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>26. The trade commenced very bri&s;kly; but nothing was called for &s;o eagerly as red feathers; &s;o that the captain found it nece&s;&s;ary to order the men abaft, and to forbid them to traffic with red feathers, as it &s;poiled the pro|vi&s;ion trade. This day &s;ome bars of iron were taken from the hold for the armourer's u&s;e, and &s;ome tons of &s;tone-balla&s;t &s;towed in the hold in their room. Some fire-works were al&s;o this day di&s;played for the entertainment of the queen and royal family. Mr. Fo&s;ter was now indefatigable in his re&s;earches after the natural
<PB N="243" REF="256">
productions of the country; and in this i&s;land he was permitted to range without fear or mole&s;tation wherever any thing that attracted his notice was to be found.</P>
<P>27. This day the coopers being ordered on &s;hore to clean and repair &s;ome leaky water-ca&s;ks, one of them lo&s;t his adze, which was &s;tolen from him while he was at dinner; and as he never was able to recover it, he was pu|ni&s;hed with twelve la&s;hes for his neglect.</P>
<P>28. The gentlemen were invited by the king to be pre&s;ent at a play. Their plays con&s;i&s;t of three di&s;tinct modes of action; mu|&s;ic, dancing, and farce. Their mu&s;ic is but mean, except their &s;inging, which is plaintive and &s;weet; their dancing inimitable; and their farce not inferior or unlike to the drolls at Bartholomew-Fair. In &s;hort, they are more laughable than the gentlemen expected, who returned not di&s;plea&s;ed with their day's diver|&s;ion, nor unaffected with the charms of &s;ome of the performers, who were the king's daugh|ters, and decorated with flowers and ornaments &s;o prettily interwoven with their hair, as to add a grace to their natural beauty that was quite irre&s;i&s;tible. Nothing could deform them but the di&s;torted mouths they are taught to make in varying the attitudes of their war dances, which are &s;o inimitably ugly that none of the
<PB N="244" REF="257">
&s;ailors, &s;ome of whom are excellent mimicks, could copy them.</P>
<P>29. The pinnace and large cutter being moored every night at the buoy, as &s;oon as it was light it was di&s;covered that the rudders and tillers of both ve&s;&s;els were wanting. Word being brought on board of this theft, the cap|tain ordered the cox&s;wain of the pinnace in irons for his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;tantly went on &s;hore to recover the lo&s;s: upon farther en|quiry he was told, that the boat's grapnel was gone, as was likewi&s;e the boat hook. On complaint to the king, his maje&s;ty a&s;&s;i&s;ted the captain in the di&s;covery of the thieves, and, after diligent enquiry, found out the per&s;on who had &s;tolen the grapnels, and recovered them, as they likewi&s;e did the per&s;ons who had taken the rudders; but one of them was found &s;plit to get at the iron-work, and the other was returned without injury. The tiller of the pinnace and the boat's hook never were heard of; but in the room of them a large hog was brought, together with an immen&s;e heap of bread fruit. About &s;ix the cox&s;wain was relea&s;ed from his irons, as it was not in the power of man to guard again&s;t all the &s;trata|gems of the natives to &s;teal iron.</P>
<P>30. The pinnace and launch went to the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land with the gentlemen on board, to pay a vi&s;it to the friends of the In|dian
<PB N="245" REF="258">
who had been to the &s;outhward, and to re&s;tore him again in &s;afety to their care. The captain was cautious of taking him to Eng|land, as he was not certain that any Briti&s;h &s;hip would again be &s;ent to vi&s;it the i&s;land, and he was unwilling to confine him in Eu|rope.</P>
<P>31. Nothing remarkable.</P>
<P>June 1. The powder was taken on &s;hore to air, and 22 hogs were brought on board which had been purcha&s;ed up the country.</P>
<P>2. A report was &s;pread that Mr. Banks and capt. Furneaux, commander of the Adven|ture, were arrived at Ulietea in two different &s;hips. This gave great joy to the inhabitants, who believed it; but it happened to prove the lie of the day to plea&s;e the inhabitants, of whom tho&s;e two gentlemen were remarkable favourites.</P>
<P>3. In return for their plays the captain en|tertained the royal family with a di&s;play of fire-works, played off from a little i&s;le about 100 yards from the &s;hore, where they had the happie&s;t effect imaginable, and were beheld with the greate&s;t admiration by the inhabitants for many miles up the country.</P>
<P>4. Preparations were this day made for put|ting to &s;ea, and in the afternoon a breeze &s;pringing up fair, after taking leave of the royal family, and leaving them all in tears; and
<PB N="246" REF="259">
after entru&s;ting a letter with Obidee to be given to Captain Furneaux, if he &s;hould happen to touch at that i&s;land, they weighed anchor, and &s;et &s;ail. The number of hogs which were pur|cha&s;ed was greater than they could find room for alive; they therefore ventured to kill &s;ome of them to &s;alt, but they proved very indiffe|rent meat.</P>

<PB N="249" REF="263">
the country, however, appeared to be full of trees, and on the S. E. &s;ide of it they could perceive them loaded with cocoa-nuts: they &s;aw al&s;o plantain and banano-trees in &s;quares, as if planted by line. Being not above a mile from the &s;hore, many of the natives were ob|&s;erved to be in motion, and in le&s;s than an hour the beach was crouded with them. Sounding for anchorage, they found no bot|tom; they therefore proceeded with an ea&s;y &s;ail along the North &s;hore from W. to S. W. The N. E. part of the i&s;land is pretty round. Lat. at noon 18 deg. 55 min. S. long. deg. min. Being now arrived at the We&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, they again &s;aw &s;everal of the na|tives in motion, having large clubs and &s;pears in their hands. The captain ordered the pin|nace and large cutter to be hoi&s;ted out, armed and well manned; and, taking with him &s;eve|ral of the principal officers and gentlemen, he landed and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land for his Britannic Maje&s;ty King George the Third; hoi&s;ting at the &s;ame time an union jack, and giving it the name of Prince Frederic's I&s;land, in honour of the the Prince of Wales. No &s;ooner was the ceremony over than one of the gentlemen received a &s;evere blow on the left arm with a &s;tone from an invi&s;ible hand. Looking up to the top of the rocks, which almo&s;t ro&s;e perpendicularly, they perceived a
<PB N="250" REF="264">
company of the natives almo&s;t over their heads, the foot of the rock not being more than 30 feet from the edge of the water. See|ing the &s;avages have &s;o much advantage over them, they judged it prudent to take to their boats, in which they continued to coa&s;t along the &s;hore, in order to di&s;cover a more conve|nient place to land; nor was it ea&s;y to find a place le&s;s dangerous than that which they had ju&s;t left. The next attempt they made to land had well nigh proved fatal to the captain: a &s;avage from the rocks ob&s;erving their mo|tions, threw his &s;pear with a&s;toni&s;hing force, the direction of which was full at the captain's body; but fortunately he &s;aw it a-coming ju&s;t time enough by &s;tooping to let it fly over his head, and when it fell it grazed the thigh of one of the gentlemen that &s;tood behind. The &s;ignal was then given to fire upon them, which was ince&s;&s;antly kept up for &s;ome time, during which &s;ome of them were ob&s;erved to drop, and the re&s;t fled into the woods, and were no more &s;een, making, however, a dreadful howl|ing and yelling, as if calling together their whole force. The captain finding nothing to be got here without a great deal of blood&s;hed, and without hazarding the lives of his people to no good purpo&s;e, thought proper to em|bark, and to continue his cour&s;e in &s;earch of a more ho&s;pitable people to recruit his &s;tores.
<PB N="251" REF="265">
The &s;avages of this i&s;land may properly be &s;o called: they were a fierce looking race, &s;ome with &s;hock, and others with long black hair tied round their heads and adorned with fea|thers. Their complexion was a bright &s;hin|ing black, made &s;o by art, as their thighs were of a dark copper colour. They were nimble and active, &s;tout and re&s;olute; and were not ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed even when the great &s;hot was fired among&s;t them.</P>
<P>22. They continued their cour&s;e S. W. by W. and at noon were in lat. 19 deg. 26 min. Nothing worth relating intervening.</P>
<P>23. Cour&s;e continued. Lat. at noon 19 deg. 53 min. Cour&s;e in the afternoon W. S. W.</P>
<P>24. In the morning cour&s;e as before. At eight &s;teered W. by S. and in the afternoon W. N. W. Lat. at noon 20 deg. 14 min. S.</P>
<P>25. Bore away W. by S. At three hauled to the ea&s;tward, in hopes of land. At five tacked and &s;tood to the N. W. At half pa&s;t five &s;aw land from beam to beam. Cour&s;e W. by S. It proved a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, &s;ome very large, and others &s;mall.</P>
<P>26. They directed their cour&s;e for the long|e&s;t i&s;le. Several canoes came from the i&s;les indi&s;criminately, and brought plantains, bread-fruit, yams and fi&s;h. The people appeared in every re&s;pect like the Am&s;terdamers. At noon they ca&s;t anchor on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land,
<PB N="252" REF="266">
about half a mile from the &s;hore in 21 fathom water, red &s;and, broken &s;hells, and &s;mall &s;tones; and pre&s;ently hoi&s;ted out the large cut|ter, and &s;teadied the &s;hip for the convenience of trade. This afternoon one of the natives got hold of the lead-line, and was making with it towards the &s;hore; but being di&s;covered, was &s;hot at, brought back, and the line re&s;tored. Shaddocks, and yams were brought in plenty.</P>
<P>27. Several of the natives came off with hogs, fowls, fi&s;h and fruit, but none were ad|mitted on board, nor were any of their women, on account of the di&s;orders contracted at Otta|heite, which &s;till remained uncured. The com|mon men were likewi&s;e forbidden to trade with the natives, to prevent the ill-con&s;equences of quarrels that frequently happened in making their bargains. About &s;even in the morning the captain and ma&s;ter went in the pinnace, attended by a company of marines, in &s;earch of water, and about eight returned, having found a watering place, but the water bracki&s;h. About nine the empty water-ca&s;ks were &s;ent on &s;hore in the launch; and the pinnace and cut|ter went to trade, and in le&s;s than half an hour came back loaded; but in the hurry the &s;ur|geon lo&s;t his fowling-piece. It was here ob|&s;ervable as at Am&s;terdam that many of the na|tives were without their little finger; that not a few had &s;cars cut in the upper part of their

cheeks, and others had &s;everal circles, one with|in another, on their arms, as if branded. They under&s;tood that the&s;e were &s;igns of mourn|ing.</P>
<P>28. The morning being clear, they di&s;cern|ed from the ma&s;t-head two large i&s;lands to the northward, at the di&s;tance of 16 or 17 leagues. About ten they appeared as repre&s;ented in the plate. The low i&s;land the Indians called Ta&s;|&s;ua; and the peeked i&s;land, they called Eka-u-u. At &s;ix the launch was &s;ent for water&mdash;when &s;he landed the natives came about her in &s;warms, and one of them &s;eized a cartouch-box full of ammunition; others wre&s;ted the &s;econd lieu|tenant's fowling-piece from him; and others &s;eized the cooper's bucket, with his adze and a quantity of bungs in it, and in&s;tantly made off. The boats crew fired at them, and they drop|ped the bucket; but kept the adze, the fow|ling-piece, and the cartouch-box. They &s;eem|ed, indeed, in le&s;s dread of fire-arms than any of the &s;avages they had yet met with; for the fellow who took the cartouch-box, &s;eized the nozzle of the gun which the &s;oldier was about to point at him, directed it from him, and by that means got clear off with his booty. As the likelie&s;t means to oblige them to re&s;tore their plunder, the captain cau&s;ed a large &s;ail|ing canoe to be &s;eized, to which they made &s;ome oppo&s;ition. On the approach of the party com|manded
<PB N="254" REF="269">
on that &s;ervice, of which the captain him&s;elf was the leader, the &s;avages, all but one man jumped over-board, but it was not till the ve&s;&s;el was hauled upon the beach that he could be prevailed upon to quit his property; and when he did, he made towards the captain, armed with a de&s;perate weapon, which he brandi&s;hed with one hand over his head, and with the other clapt his breech. It was in vain that &s;igns were made him to lay it down, but the captain pre&s;enting his piece at him, he then, being in &s;ome fear, dropped it on the ground; but the in&s;tant the piece was taken from the captain's &s;houlder, that in&s;tant he &s;natched up his weapon and advanced as before. The cap|tain was now in his own defence obliged to fire, but being unwilling to kill &s;o brave a fel|low, took aim where he could lea&s;t injure him, and &s;hot him in the thighs. The gun was load|ed with &s;wan &s;hot, one of which pierced the very hand with which he was denouncing defiance; he then ran howling to the woods; and pre|&s;ently five or &s;ix of his companions came with him upon their backs, and &s;eemed to &s;uppli|cate relief. The &s;urgeon very humanely dre&s;|&s;ed his wounds, applying to them a remedy he had learned among the Indians of &s;craped &s;ugar-cane &s;pread upon a certain leaf. After this rencounter they &s;eemed very peaceable, and &s;oon re&s;tored the fowling-pieces and adze.
<PB N="255" REF="270">
The water being bad, the captain, unwilling to lo&s;e time, ordered the boats to be hoi&s;ted in, and the &s;hip to &s;et &s;ail. This i&s;land, our journali&s;t &s;ays, was called by the natives Ana|mocka; the &s;ame to which Ta&s;man gave the name of Rotterdam, and where he received quite different treatment.</P>
<P>29. They directed their cour&s;e to the large i&s;lands which they had de&s;cried the day before, and kept on &s;ounding all the way from 60 to 39 fathom water. The natives followed the &s;hip all day with provi&s;ions to trade.</P>
<P>30. About one in the afternoon they ap|proached the i&s;lands. On the lowe&s;t and we&s;|ternmo&s;t of the two they ob&s;erved a continual &s;moke i&s;&s;uing from a hill, the ea&s;termo&s;t end of which gave them rea&s;on to think that a burning mountain &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;omewhere in that direction, and it was not long before they were convinced of the truth of their conjecture. When at the di&s;tance of three leagues, the &s;hip's cour&s;e N. W. by W. the two i&s;lands ap|peared as repre&s;ented in the Plate. Long. at noon 19 deg. 55 min. About five in the afternoon they were in full &s;ail between the i&s;lands, the lowe&s;t of which the Indians who followed the &s;hip to trade called Tu&s;&s;ua. It appeared in &s;ome places &s;o burnt that they could plainly di&s;cover from the &s;hip by the appearance of trees how far the conflagration

had reached. As &s;oon as they were to leeward of the burning mountain, though it was not ju&s;t then raging, the people could perceive by the &s;mart of their eyes when they looked to windward, that the very air was impregnated with &s;ulphurous atoms. At night &s;hortened &s;ail, and hove too.</P>
<P>July 1. Pur&s;ued their cour&s;e, without at|tempting to land, though no rea&s;on is given by our journali&s;t for &s;o doing. At five in the morning cour&s;e W. S. W. with the wind from E. S. E. This cour&s;e was continued the whole day and all the following night.</P>
<P>2. Cour&s;e in the morning as before. At half after eleven di&s;covered land, bearing about W. by N. half N. and bore away towards it, &s;teering to N. W. Lat. at noon 20 deg. 6 min. It appeared to be full of trees; but when they came up with it found it, reefed all round. Stood off and on all night, and in the morning &s;ent the large cutter to &s;ound and examine the &s;hore. On her return the officer on board reported that no anchorage was prac|ticable; and after examining the coa&s;t for a con&s;iderable way, and attempting in vain to get &s;ome turtle, of which by &s;everal &s;ymptoms, there was rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e there were many about the i&s;land, they made &s;ail and pur&s;ued their cour&s;e.

the two large i&s;lands that formed the &s;trait, and kept tacking every two hours the whole night.</P>
<P>20. In the morning they could perceive that they had gained con&s;iderably in the night, owing to the current which &s;et to the wind|ward. At eight they could &s;ee four i&s;lands, very high and very exten&s;ive. At ten they were clo&s;e under the South end of the large&s;t i&s;land, where they &s;aw multitudes of the inha|bitants, who lined the rocks, bellowing and howling; and &s;aw al&s;o many &s;mokes within land. At eleven they came in &s;ight of a large and high i&s;land from the ma&s;t head, lying to windward.</P>
<P>21. Tacked, and &s;tood for the high i&s;land. At ten they came in &s;ight of two other large i&s;les, on one of which was a burning mountain. About twelve, being near one of tho&s;e i&s;les, great numbers of &s;avages pre&s;ented them&s;elves, armed with clubs, &s;pears, and bows and ar|rows. At one tacked, and &s;tood in for a plea|&s;ant bay that pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the i&s;le which lies at the We&s;t end of that on which the burn|ing mountain was &s;ituated. At four hove to, and hoi&s;ted out the boats, armed them, and &s;ent them in to &s;ound; at four they made the &s;ignal of anchorage, and at five the &s;hip came to an anchor in nine fathom water, fine &s;andy bottom. The &s;hip was &s;carce moored before
<PB N="261" REF="274">
the natives came off in their canoes from the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay, and many &s;wam from the We&s;t &s;ide; the di&s;tance not above a quarter of a mile. They were of the negroe kind, quite black, and woolly headed, poor mean de&s;picable looking wretches, but armed with bows and poi&s;oned arrows, with every one a club made of hard wood &s;lung over his &s;houl|ders. They were quite naked, except a girdle, or piece of matting, tied round the wai&s;t, and drawn &s;o tight that it was with difficulty that a finger could be thru&s;t between it and the &s;kin: they wear, be&s;ides, on one wri&s;t a piece of wood or bone, &s;o nicely jointed that it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover the &s;eam: this too was pre&s;&s;ed &s;o tight that many imagined it mu&s;t have been put on when they were very young, and that the wri&s;t had grown up to it; for, being curiou&s;ly embo&s;&s;ed, it was at fir&s;t thought to be one piece, and nobody &s;u&s;pect|ed to find a joint. Some of them were mark|ed on their bodies, but very different from any they had before &s;een; for, in&s;tead of be|ing &s;mooth, and &s;eemingly indented within the &s;kin, their marks appeared rough and rai&s;ed above it. As &s;oon as they approached the &s;hip, or came near any of the crew, they &s;prinkled water over their heads, patted their heads with their open hands, crying Towmar|row, Towmarrow; but offering no kind of
<PB N="262" REF="275">
rudene&s;s, nor mi&s;behaviour of any kind. They kept about the &s;hip, with lights, after it was dark, and when they had &s;ufficiently gratified their curio&s;ity, they went quietly away. Their boats were of a form very different from any they had be&s;ore &s;een, being rai&s;ed higher in the middle than at either end.</P>
<P>22. Great numbers of them came about the &s;hip, and &s;ome came on board. At fir&s;t they &s;hewed no di&s;po&s;ition to mi&s;chief, but leaped about, and admired every thing they &s;aw. Being unwilling, however, to go away, and many of them pre&s;&s;ing to be admitted at once, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e their attempts, which brought on a quarrel, and &s;everal of them let fly their arrows from their canoes, again&s;t which the crew were upon their guard, as &s;u&s;pecting their intent. The marines were then ordered to fire, and in a &s;hort time the &s;hip was cleared from &s;uch unwelcome vi&s;itors. One of the fellows, however, in going off let fly an arrow, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, again&s;t one of the officers; but he paid for his audacity with his life. In the afternoon the captain ordered out the pinnace, and with a party of marines, well armed, went on &s;hore. The natives on &s;eeing them land made a halt, and &s;tood quite &s;till. The captain, willing to make friends with them, &s;hewed them &s;ome articles of Eu|ropean manufacture, and &s;ome of Indian; and
<PB N="263" REF="276">
made &s;igns for them to lay a&s;ide their wea|pons, and &s;it down, which they obeyed. He then went up to them, and pre&s;ented their chief with a few trifles, with which he &s;eemed very much plea&s;ed; he next acquainted them that the &s;hip was in want of water, but they either did not, or would not understand him; and &s;eeing there was none to be gotten with|out blood&s;hed, nor any wood to be had but what was as hard as brazil, the captain return|ed on board, and prepared to &s;ail. None of the&s;e people brought either fle&s;h or fruit to di&s;po&s;e of; nor could the captain procure more than one lean hog, though there were many within &s;ight. Tho&s;e who were of the wooding party &s;aw &s;everal of their women, who, they reported, were ten times uglier than the men. The fellows who fir&s;t entered the &s;hip were earne&s;t with the &s;ailors to expo&s;e them&s;elves, but being refu&s;ed with the true &s;pirit of Briti&s;h tars, their re&s;entment was fir&s;t excited by the manner in which they were re|pul&s;ed: they continued, however, peaceable the remainder of the time the &s;hip &s;taid, and the gentlemen and fi&s;hers pur&s;ued their fi&s;hing without mole&s;tation. At ten they catched a &s;hark about twelve feet long: in hauling him near the boat, he gave a &s;udden plunge, and, &s;eizing the &s;tem in his mouth, left two of his teeth buried in the wood, and it was with the
<PB N="264" REF="277">
utmo&s;t danger and difficulty that five of the boat's crew could get the better of him. In di&s;&s;ecting his head for one of the gentlemen to pre&s;erve his jawbones, three inches of an Indian arrow was found buried in his brains.</P>
<P>23. Weighed and got clear out of the bay by towing, the Indians following in their ca|noes. Several of the gentlemen fell &s;ick, as &s;uppo&s;ed, by eating the large red ground fi&s;h which they had caught in the bay: they were &s;trengthened in this opinion by the dogs being taken ill that had eaten the fragments; and one of the hogs that had taken what the dogs brought up, actually died; being opened, the liver and inte&s;tines were turned quite black. Though the people had no notion of trade, yet &s;everal of the &s;ailors prevailed on &s;ome of them to part with their bows and arrows, which they exchanged for beads and other trifles; but their &s;pears nothing that was of|fered them could purcha&s;e. From the cir|cum&s;tances of the gentlemens falling &s;ick, and the natives u&s;ing poi&s;oned arrows, the captain named this bay Venomous-Bay.</P>
<P>24. At &s;ix made &s;ail. At nine &s;aw four unknown i&s;lands, &s;urrounded with a reef. A number of &s;mall i&s;lands in &s;ight the whole day. Tacked every two or three hours the follow|ing night.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="278">25. Still &s;ailing among a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands. The gentlemen &s;till &s;ick.</P>
<P>26. This morning there were thirteen or fourteen i&s;lands in &s;ight. They directed their cour&s;e S. E. by E. the ea&s;ternmo&s;t land bear|ing S. E. They could &s;ee from the decks the natives of &s;everal i&s;les running along the beaches to look at the &s;hip. At noon they changed their direction to S. E. half S. and at night they kept tacking every two hours.</P>
<P>27. Came in &s;ight of four new i&s;lands, of which none had been noticed before. Lat. at noon 18 deg. 20 min. Cour&s;e as before.</P>
<P>28. At &s;ix in the morning tacked, and &s;tood in for the land. At noon tacked, and &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward for two or three &s;trange i&s;lands that appeared at a great di&s;tance. Latitude 18 deg. 29 min. At four tacked, and &s;tood to the We&s;tward. Saw land bearing South. The gentlemen who had been poi&s;oned with the fi&s;h pretty well recovered.</P>
<P>30. Saw more i&s;lands almo&s;t in every di|rection. They were now in what is called in our maps the Archipelago of the Great Cycla|des, and of which till now we have had a very vague account.</P>
<P>31. This day they caught two large &s;harks, one of which had five &s;mall turtle in his belly, one eighteen inches long and twelve broad;
<PB N="266" REF="279">
the other had three or four bonettas of con|&s;iderable &s;ize.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 1. Bore away S. by W. round the North We&s;t end of an i&s;land about four or five leagues to the windward. At four in the afternoon &s;aw &s;everal of the natives, who ap|peared in every re&s;pect the &s;ame as the &s;avages in Venomous-bay. They made &s;igns for the voy|agers to land, by waving green boughs, the emblems of peace, and &s;ome of them jumped into the water, and made for the &s;hip; but the &s;hip making way, they were &s;oon di&s;tanced.</P>
<P>2. About nine in the morning they &s;ent the cutter in &s;hore to examine the ground, but &s;he &s;oon returned without finding anchorage. They then bore away to the North Ea&s;tward to an i&s;land they had already pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>3. At &s;ix brought to an anchor in 10 fa|thom water, rocky ground. Great numbers of the natives came &s;wimming towards the &s;hip; but on the boats being hoi&s;ted out, they all made to land again. Their yellings were different from any they had yet heard.</P>
<P>4. Early in the morning the pinnace and large cutter went off to examine the coa&s;t, and to endeavour to find out a convenient place to wood and water. At half pa&s;t &s;even tho&s;e on board the &s;hip were alarmed by a continual firing from the boats on the &s;hore, and immediately fired a &s;wivel gun loaded
<PB N="267" REF="280">
with grape-&s;hot, and &s;ent the &s;mall cutter well manned and armed to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the boats already engaged; at the &s;ame time con|tinuing to fire from the &s;hip with grape-&s;hot. Soon after this the boats returned, and brought word, that they had &s;carce touched the ground when the &s;avages attacked them, and wanted to haul the boats into the woods; that one of the boat&s;wain's mates was unfortunately run through the cheek with a &s;pear, which they threw from the land; that one of the &s;ailors was likewi&s;e wounded in the thigh in two places by a like weapon; that the ma&s;ter, who commanded on this occa&s;ion, was al&s;o wounded in the brea&s;t with an arrow, the point of which very fortunately broke in piercing his cloaths, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t have penetrated to his heart; and that &s;ome others had receiv|ed very de&s;perate blows before their guns could be made u&s;e of; that, in return, they had killed &s;everal of the &s;avages, and had wounded many more; and that by means of the &s;uccours that had been &s;ent them, and the firing from the &s;hip, they had at length clear|ed the coa&s;t of them. This conflict was con|tinued for more than an hour, in which time &s;howers of arrows, &s;pears, and &s;tones came from the bu&s;hes, and flew over and between the people in the boats, but providentially no other hurt was received except what we have
<PB N="268" REF="281">
already related: many more, however, of the enemy would have been killed, but that the flints were &s;o bad the powder would not take fire. Of the flints the complaint was general throughout the voyage, though it is not ea&s;y to account for &s;uch a defect, as the flints con|tracted for by government are the be&s;t that can be procured. As &s;oon as the boats re|turned the &s;hip prepared to &s;ail, being told that no water was to be found in that bay, though it &s;eemed to abound with every thing el&s;e. At ten they fired a round &s;hot among the &s;avages that &s;hewed them&s;elves upon the &s;hore, and &s;tood out of the bay in &s;earch of a more ho&s;pitable people. At night they ob|&s;erved a great body of fire, which i&s;&s;ued from the burning mountain already mentioned, from whence they were not now at any con|&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>5. Stood in for the i&s;land, on which they had ob&s;erved the burning mountain, and near which they had before landed, as has already been related. The bay they now di&s;covered was &s;ituated at the S. S. W. part of the i&s;land, where the boats were &s;ent out to reconnoitre, and pre&s;ently brought word that there was &s;afe anchorage in four fathom and a half water, that there was plenty of fre&s;h water on &s;hore, and that there was great appearance of plenty of every thing el&s;e that was wanted, particu|larly
<PB N="269" REF="282">
of wood and fruit. This bay lay in and out N. N. E. and S. S. W. the burning hill bearing we&s;t half north. They had &s;carce ca&s;t anchor, when &s;everal of the natives came off with cocoa-nuts, yams, bannanoes, plantains, &amp;c. and one, an old man, brought on board one fowl, which he pre&s;ented to the captain. Tho&s;e who brought the fruit were afraid to ap|proach the &s;hip, on which the captain ordered the &s;mall cutter to be manned, and to row to|wards them; but even this &s;eemed to terrify them. They made off from the boat, but threw &s;ome cocoa-nuts into it, for which they did not &s;eem to expect any reward. Here we cannot help remarking, that, by the &s;avages bringing every where, upon the approach of the &s;hip, cocoa-nuts, and other fruits, it &s;hould &s;eem that they imagined the &s;trangers to be a people like them&s;elves, come from &s;ome di&s;tant i&s;land to vi&s;it them; and that therefore, it being u&s;ual for &s;uch vi&s;itors to be in want of &s;uch refre&s;hments, it might be the cu&s;tom for the inhabitants upon their fir&s;t coming, to &s;upply them; but that when they &s;aw a people totally unlike them&s;elves, and in a ve&s;&s;el too different from any they had ever before &s;een, it was but natural for them to retreat, not knowing their errand, and dreading perhaps an inva&s;ion, or &s;ome mi&s;chief to befall their country. Something of this kind mu&s;t cer|tainly
<PB N="270" REF="283">
have been the ca&s;e, otherwi&s;e it is not ea&s;y to account for their coming off in their canoes loaded with fruit, and then retiring back without daring to go near the people they intended to &s;upply. Be this as it may, it was not long before great numbers of them came about the &s;hip, armed with the &s;ame wea|pons as the inhabitants about Venomous-Bay made u&s;e of when the &s;hip anchored there. There being now about 40 canoes gathered round the &s;hip, they fir&s;t began by endeavour|ing to cut away the buoy; but a few mu&s;ket-balls being whi&s;tled about their ears, pre&s;ent|ly obliged them to de&s;ert that enterprize. They then began their war &s;ong, the certain &s;ignal to engage. To intimidate them, and to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood, a four pounder was fired over their heads; at which they all jumped into the &s;ea, and made towards the &s;hore; but recovering them&s;elves, and finding that no one had received any hurt, they again boarded their canoes, and advanced as before. It was then thought nece&s;&s;ary to fire to effect, and two or three of their canoes being di&s;abled by one &s;hot, the re&s;t fled ha&s;tily to &s;hore; the boats followed, and in &s;ight of thou&s;ands of them filled &s;ome ca&s;ks of water, and returned to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>6. The boats were ordered to land as before; but previou&s;ly to that attempt, the captain or|dered
<PB N="271" REF="284">
a &s;pring upon the cable to keep the &s;hip's broad-&s;ide to the &s;hore, to cover the waterers; and went him&s;elf in the pinnace to make peace with the natives. Finding them, however, drawn up in two &s;eparate bodies, all armed and prepared for war, he cau&s;ed a mu&s;ket to be fired over their heads, and made the &s;ignal for them to lay down their arms, which they refu&s;ed to do, with menaces if he dared to land. On this defiance, the &s;ignal was made for the &s;hip to fire, which was in&s;tantly obeyed with great guns, &s;wivels, and wall-pieces, loaded with grape-&s;hot, which in le&s;s than a minute &s;o cleared the &s;hore of them, that only two of them remained, one of whom was the old man who the day before had pre&s;ented the captain with a fowl. About one the boats returned to the &s;hip loaded with water, cocoa-nuts, and plantains, which, after they had felt the effects of the &s;hip's &s;uperiority, they brought in great abundance to the water's edge, laying them down, and running away without waiting for any thing in exchange.</P>
<P>7. After what had pa&s;&s;ed on the 6th, the natives, to all appearance, a&s;&s;umed a new a&s;|pect: they came and laid down their arms, and &s;eemed to &s;upplicate for peace, which was readily granted on the part of the voyagers; and lines were marked out, over which they were not to pa&s;s. Peace being thus far e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
<PB N="272" REF="285">
the natives came down unarmed, and brought with them watever the i&s;land afford|ed; for which they received in return &s;uch articles of trade as they liked be&s;t. The fi&s;hers now began to fi&s;h without fear, and at three hauls of the &s;eine, they caught above 500 mullet, many of them weighing 10 lb. a-fi&s;h. The old Indian came frequently on board, and the captain u&s;ed him with great civility. It was &s;oon di&s;covered, that the body of Indians who intended to attack the &s;hip were not the inhabitants about the bay, but people from another quarter, who finding them&s;elves un|equal to the undertaking, di&s;per&s;ed and retir|ed every one to his own home. It was, however, thought prudent to be con&s;tantly on guard.</P>
<P>7. The boats went as u&s;ual for wood and water; and this day the captain's markee was &s;et up on &s;nore, the natives behaving with the utmo&s;t humility and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>During the whole time of their &s;tay the volcano roared in a mo&s;t terrifying manner, &s;ometimes emitting whole torrents of flame and &s;moke that a&s;cended above the clouds; and &s;ometimes &s;tones of &s;uch an enourmous &s;ize as to be equal in bulk to the &s;hip's pinnace, which were thrown like pebbles to an incre|dible di&s;tance. The convul&s;ions wherewith it was agitated before the&s;e va&s;t bodies were ejected, &s;eemed to &s;hake the foundations of
<PB N="273" REF="286">
the i&s;land; and though the place where the &s;hip lay was more than twelve miles di&s;tant, yet the a&s;hes, when the wind blew a breeze from the we&s;tward, would cover the decks like du&s;t.</P>
<P>The natives of this i&s;land are very black, but make them&s;elves &s;till blacker than they are by nature, by painting their faces of a &s;hining jet, inter&s;per&s;ed with red and white &s;pots on their no&s;es and foreheads. Between their no&s;trils they bore holes, which they keep open with a &s;hort &s;tick. They go naked, ex|cept a &s;ort of broad girdle round their wai&s;ts, in which the men tie up in a very &s;ingular manner their marks of manhood, which by their way of dre&s;&s;ing, appear of uncommmon magnitude: in this con&s;i&s;ts their pride. Their hair, which is not woolly, they tie differently, as each likes be&s;t: &s;ome let it flow down their &s;houlders; others tie it up in folds about their heads: others again twi&s;t it, and let it hang in plaits; while not a few of them cut it &s;hort, or, as we &s;ay, crop it. They hoop and whi&s;tle to call a number of them together, when they intend mi&s;chief; and when they apprehend danger, they hide them&s;elves in the covert of the woods.</P>
<P>Their women are in general pa&s;&s;able when young, but frightful when they grow old. On their heads they wear a kind of bonnet, not
<PB N="274" REF="287">
inelegantly matted, and round their wai&s;ts a &s;hort petticoat which reaches to their knees; this too is made of a kind of matting, for no cloth was &s;een among them: they paint them|&s;elves variou&s;ly as well as the men, but their favourite colour is red. The men &s;eemed very jealous of them, and never &s;uffered any of them to appear alone. They generally kept behind the men; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were of age had a child, or a bundle upon their backs: they, notwith&s;tanding, were always merry, either &s;houting or laughing.</P>
<P>Like almo&s;t all the other i&s;landers they were fond of working tools, and that induced them to watch an opportunity to &s;teal the cooper's adze; which being mi&s;&s;ed, another fray com|menced, and one of the &s;avages bent his bow to &s;hoot at the man who was pur&s;uing the thieves; but not being quick enough in tak|ing aim, the man &s;hot him dead with the bow in his hand. The old Indian, however, who has often been mentioned, recovered the adze, and returned it to the cooper.</P>
<P>Here the water being very conveniently &s;ituated, not above 30 or 40 yards from the &s;hore, the ca&s;ks were filled almo&s;t as &s;oon as they could be cleaned and repaired; and there being plenty of wood, the&s;e two nece&s;&s;ary ar|ticles were fully compleated; and the boats, before the other repairs could be accompli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="275" REF="288">
had time to recruit the balla&s;t, in propor|tion as the &s;hip's &s;tores were expended. Dur|ing the &s;hip's &s;tay, the people were plentifully &s;upplied with fi&s;h and fruit; but of pork, or other animal food, there was little to be pro|cured.</P>
<P>It is not a little remarkable, that the natives of this i&s;land were more &s;crupulous in taking any thing from the &s;ailors than tho&s;e of any other nation, and never would touch with their bare hands what was given them, but al|ways received it between green leaves, which they afterwards tied up, and carried upon the ends of their clubs; and if ever any of the &s;ailors touched their &s;kin, they always rubbed the part with the like green leaf. Our jour|nali&s;t ob&s;erves, that, notwith&s;tanding this fal&s;e delicacy, they gave the &s;ailors to under&s;tand, that they eat one another; and one day when the inhabitants about the bay were in motion, and many of them marched forth armed to &s;ome di&s;tant part of the i&s;land, tho&s;e that re|mained invited the gentlemen to fea&s;t upon a man that they had barbiqued; which they re|fu&s;ed with the utmo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>When the&s;e people make a wonder at any thing, they cry Hebow, and &s;hake their right hand. They wear bracelets, like as the In|dians of Venomous-bay, in which they &s;tick their hair-pricker, (an in&s;trument which they
<PB N="276" REF="289">
u&s;e to dre&s;s their heads) and likewi&s;e the &s;lings with which they throw their javelins; and it is a&s;toni&s;hing with what dexterity and force &s;ome of them will hit a mark. One of them, to &s;hew the commanding officer on &s;hore what he could do, threw his &s;pear without his &s;ling through the bole of a three four inches in diameter, at 20 yards di&s;tance: another of them in the pre&s;ence of the fir&s;t lieutenant &s;hot a fi&s;h as it &s;wam along in the &s;ea at the di&s;tance of 26 yards, with a bow and arrow, which fi&s;h the lieutenant carried on board with the arrow &s;ticking in its body, as a proof of what he had &s;een performed.</P>
<P>Some of the gentlemen, one clear day, at|tempted to a&s;cend a hill at &s;ome di&s;tance, with intent to view the volcano more clearly, but were obliged to retire precipitately, the ground under them being &s;o hot that they might as well have walked upon a hot oven: the &s;mell too was intolerably &s;ulphureous, which pro|ceeded from a &s;moke that i&s;&s;ued through the fi&s;&s;ures of the earth; yet from this &s;moke the natives find a remedy for their cutaneous di&s;orders. The gentlemen ob&s;erving a man holding a child over the &s;moke, had the curio|&s;ity to enquire the rea&s;on, who made them un|der&s;tand, by &s;hewing the child's eruptions, that it was troubled with the itch.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="290">While the people were employed in &s;earch|ing for balla&s;t, they di&s;covered water i&s;&s;uing from the crevices of a rock, hot enough to draw tea. Two of the &s;hip's company who had been troubled with rheumatic complaints, at times, throughout the voyage, went accom|panied with the &s;urgeon to bathe in the water, but found the &s;tones &s;o hot underneath that they could not &s;tand upon them, without fir&s;t plunging in &s;ome of their cold garments to keep the &s;oles of their feet from touching them. In one place the waters were &s;o hot there was no bearing the finger in them: in another they were ju&s;t hot enough to bear to plunge the whole body, but not to remain any con&s;iderable time. What effect the&s;e waters had upon the two men our journali&s;t has not noted; from that circum&s;tance, as he has been all along very particular in noting the illne&s;&s;es that happened on board, and the recoveries, there is rea&s;on to conclude that the waters had but little effect.</P>
<P>Having been already ten days employed in repairing the &s;hip, taking in wood and water, and purcha&s;ing fruits, the natives began again to grow trouble&s;ome, watching every oppor|tunity to level their arrows at the guard, and re&s;trained only by the fear of their mu&s;kets from proceeding to extremities. It is more than probable, however, that an act of vio|lence
<PB N="278" REF="291">
on the part of the &s;trangers that cannot well be ju&s;tified, might give occa&s;ion to this rancorous humour among the natives. Having occa&s;ion for &s;ome large timber to &s;upply the decays of the &s;hip, orders were given a few days before their intended departure to cut down a tree of va&s;t growth, and for the con|venience of getting it on board to &s;aw it into three pieces. This tree &s;o divided, the natives eyed with plea&s;ure, not &s;u&s;pecting that the &s;trangers intended to carry it off, but to leave it in compliment to them, as it &s;uited exactly their ideas of con&s;tructing ju&s;t double the number of canoes. To the cutting down and &s;awing the natives made no oppo&s;ition; but when they &s;aw the &s;ailors employed in rolling down the body of the tree to the water's edge, they could not help looking &s;urly; and one of them, who probably was more intere&s;ted than the re&s;t, was frequently &s;een to offer his &s;pear at the labourers, but was re&s;trained for fear of the guard: at length he watched his oppor|tunity, and, &s;tarting from behind a bu&s;h, was levelling an arrow full at the commanding officer, when he was di&s;covered, and &s;hot dead. The ball tore his arm to pieces, and entered his &s;ide. His companions in&s;tantly carried off the body, and laid it in the wood, where the &s;hip's &s;urgeon went to examine it, but found it totally deprived of life.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="292">The &s;hip's company were now permitted to go a&s;hore by turns, for the pre&s;ervation of their health; but the captain knowing the natives wanted nothing &s;o much as an opportunity to revenge the death of their companions, &s;trictly enjoined them never to walk alone; nor to &s;tray more than an hundred yards from the guard.</P>
<P>In the mean time preparations were making on board to &s;et &s;ail; the &s;hip was &s;moak'd above and below, the hold fre&s;h &s;tow'd, and the balla&s;t &s;hifted; in &s;hort, every thing was placed in &s;uch order, as if the &s;hip had been but ju&s;t fitted out at home for a long voyage.</P>
<P>Though the people on this i&s;land, after feel|ing the effects of the European fire-arms, were peaceable, they were not friendly, nor were they, like the Indians in the Society-I&s;les, fond of iron; they wi&s;hed for &s;ome of the tools with which they &s;aw the &s;ailors cut down wood; but except an adze or two, they never attempted to &s;teal any thing. The coopers left their ca&s;ks during the night unguarded, nor were they un|der any apprehen&s;ions about their cloaths, which they &s;uffered to lie carele&s;sly about while they were at work. The&s;e people di&s;co|vered none of that di&s;po&s;ition to thievery which our voyagers &s;ay every Indian inherits natural|ly. In their cour&s;e of trade, they totally di&s;|regard beads, and baubles, and &s;eemed to prefer Rotterdam fi&s;h-hooks, and turtle-&s;hell,
<PB N="280" REF="293">
to every thing el&s;e that was offered them. They &s;uffered the &s;ailors to have no communication with their women; nor were they ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded to part with their arms on any account. The produce of the i&s;land they freely parted with; but on whatever required labour in the con&s;truction, they &s;et a high value.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands which compo&s;e this Archipelago, are not ea&s;ily numbered: Our journali&s;t count|ed upwards of &s;eventy in &s;ight at one time; they &s;eem to be inhabited by people of very dif|ferent natures and complexions. Some our voyagers &s;aw woolly headed, and of the Afri|can race; others of a copper colour, not un|like the New-Zealanders; and others they &s;aw of the mulatto colour; and not a few like the natives of Rotterdam, of a browni&s;h black, with long hair and &s;horn beards. The high notions, however, that were entertained of the va&s;t riches of the&s;e i&s;lands; of their abounding in pearls, &s;ilver ore, and precious &s;tones, do not &s;eem well founded; neither does the i&s;land of Menicola an&s;wer, by any means, the pom|pous de&s;cription given of it by the Spani&s;h wri|ters, who found their report on the relation of an Indian-Chief, and on that of a captive, whom Quiros &s;eized and carried to Mexico. From the former Quiros learned, that to the N. W. of his country, (Taumaco) there were more than &s;ixty i&s;lands, and a large country,
<PB N="281" REF="294">
which he called Manicola; that, to explain which were &s;mall, he made circles, and point|ed to the &s;ea with his finger, and made &s;igns that it &s;urrounded the land; and for the lar|ger he made large circles, and the &s;ame &s;igns; and for that large country he opened both his arms, without joining them again, &s;hewing that it extended without end; and by &s;igns he &s;hew|ed which people were whites, negroes, Indians, and Mulattoes, and which were mixed; and that in &s;ome i&s;lands they eat human fle&s;h; and for this he made &s;igns by biting his arm, &s;hew|ing clearly his abhorrence of &s;uch people. He likewi&s;e gave him to under&s;tand, that in the great country, there were cows or buffaloes.</P>
<P>From the captive, Quiros learnt that in &s;ome of tho&s;e i&s;lands, there were pearls, as large as &s;mall pebbles; that the pearls were white and &s;hining; and that when they looked at them again&s;t the &s;un, the &s;hining lu&s;tre dazzled their eyes; that at five days of their &s;ailing from a country which he named, lay that great coun|try Manicola, inhabited by many people, dun|coloured, and Mulattoes, who lived in large towns; that the country was high and moun|tainous, with many large rivers; that he with many others had gone to it in one of their em|barkations in que&s;t of the trunk of a large tree of the many that are in it to make a periagua; and that he &s;aw there a port larger, and the en|trance
<PB N="282" REF="295">
narrower than that of the bay of St. Phi|lip and St. Jago; and that the bottom was &s;and, and the &s;hore &s;hingle; he added, that they had warlike in&s;truments, pointed with &s;ilver. This captive, after he had learnt the Spani&s;h lan|guages, confirmed what he had &s;aid of the great country, and what the Chief had &s;aid of the many i&s;lands, and of the different nations, with which they were peopled; &s;ome lu&s;ty, with bodies punctuated; and others without punctuation, of various colours, long hair, red black, curled, and woolly-headed; and being &s;hewn &s;ome &s;tones impregnated with &s;ilver, he &s;aid in the great country he had &s;een &s;uch &s;tones and likewi&s;e at Taumaco, where the natives u&s;ed &s;ome to punctuate them&s;elves, and others for ornament.</P>
<P>From the&s;e intimations, (for we can find no other) Mr. Dalrymple infers, that if Quiros had &s;tood to the &s;outhward, <Q REND="inline">"that cour&s;e would have <HI>undoubtedly</HI> di&s;covered to him the great &s;outhern continent, or as Quiros emphatically expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>the mother of &s;o many i&s;lands.</HI>"</Q> This voyage, however, has &s;hewn all the&s;e <HI>que&s;tion|le&s;s affirmations,</HI> and <HI>probable conjectures,</HI> to be no other than mere a&s;&s;umptions founded on a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is. The cour&s;e which Ta&s;man pur&s;ued in 1722, joined to that which Captain Cooke has lately compleated in 1775, has <HI>demon&s;trated</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="296">
the <HI>non-exi&s;tence</HI> of a &s;outhern continent, in the direction, in which Mr. Dalrymple &s;o po&s;itive|ly a&s;&s;erts Quiros might have found it; and in|deed, every other direction from the line to the 50th degree of &s;outhern latitude, between which he has given it a place.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e we are now tracing along with this able navigator, is the &s;ame we had re|marked as proper for his examination in the winter of 1773, in&s;tead of &s;ailing to the ea&s;t|ward; but it is with plea&s;ure that we embrace this opportunity to di&s;claim the lea&s;t intended cen&s;ure, and to acknowledge the &s;uperiority of his judgment, as by the cour&s;e he took he has left no room for conjecture, re&s;pecting the great object he had in view, in any direction whatever. Having in 1770, &s;ailed to the &s;outhward, in long. 213 deg E. as far as the 41&s;t degree of latitude; in 1773, he &s;ailed ea&s;tward in that latitude, from the 175th, to the 227th degree of ea&s;tern longitude, where having found him|&s;elf nearly at an equal di&s;tance from the mo&s;t &s;outherly point of his track from Ottaheite to New-Zealand in 1770, and his track in the &s;ame latitude from Cape-Horn to Ottaheite the &s;ame year, he tacked and &s;teered to the north|ward, till he fell in with all the beaten tracks of former navigators, and then directed his cour&s;e for Ottaheite. From Ottaheite he widened his cour&s;e, and vi&s;iting Middle|burg and Am&s;terdam i&s;lands, he &s;ailed direct|ly
<PB N="284" REF="297">
for New-Zealand; from whence, in the &s;um|mer of that climate, he again took his de|parture, and extended his line, directing his cour&s;e &s;outhward, beyond the antarctic circle, &s;till &s;teering a &s;outh-ea&s;terly cour&s;e, till he arrived at the 265th degree of ea&s;tern longi|tude, where changing his direction to the north|ward, he again made Ottaheite his place of rendezvous, taking in his way the famous Ea&s;|ter-i&s;land of the Dutch, and determining the non-exi&s;tence of any other land, pretended to have been &s;een by Davis, or Juan Fernandez, in that quarter, and vi&s;iting the Marque&s;as of the Spaniards, which he found tolerably laid down and de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Having refre&s;hed his men, and repaired his &s;hip, at Ottaheite, the range we are de&s;cribing was part of his 3d and la&s;t enterprize; in which we have already accompanied him to Anamaka, or Rotterdam I&s;land, which he omitted to vi&s;it in his former circuit, and from thence to that great country, of which &s;o many fine things had been &s;aid, and &s;o many flattering conjectures credited; but with what foundation in truth the reader has already been made acquainted.</P>
<P>The i&s;land on which Capt. Cooke cho&s;e to refit is &s;ituated in lat. 19 deg. 30 min. S. and in long. 169 deg. 38 min. E. It is called by the natives Tanna, and the bay where the &s;hip ca&s;t anchor Providence. Where the effects of the volcano did not reach, the i&s;land is fertile,
<PB N="285" REF="298">
abounding in fruits of various &s;orts, which grow to a va&s;t magnitude: our journali&s;t weighed a yam which exceeded 55 lb. and other fruits in proportion. The trees too are of an extraordinary &s;ize; but a wide circle in the interior part of the i&s;land, di&s;covered no|thing to the eye but a dreary wa&s;te, covered with cinders, and tainting the air with &s;ulphur. Other &s;urrounding i&s;lands looked plea&s;ant to the eye; but, according to the report of the natives of Tanna, abounded in nothing of which they them&s;elves were in want.</P>
<P>Early on the 20th of Augu&s;t, the captain gave orders to weigh anchor, and about ten in the morning made &s;ail to the S. S. W. with the wind at S. S. E.</P>
<P>21. Tacked, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. At eleven the volcano bore N. W. by W. di&s;tance eight or nine leagues; and the We&s;t point of Tanna bore W. by N. half N. di&s;|tance four or five leagues. Cour&s;e round the South point of the i&s;le W. half N. This part of the i&s;land looked exceeding beautiful, as if cultivated from the tops of the highe&s;t hills to the lowe&s;t vallies. At &s;ix in the evening &s;aw land bearing N. W. by W. and &s;teered in that direc|tion.</P>
<P>22. Came a-brea&s;t of the i&s;le called Harra|mango, where the quarrel happened in which a multitude of the inhabitants were killed, and where &s;ome of the &s;hip's company were
<PB N="286" REF="299">
wounded, as has been already related. Made &s;ail to the N. W. by N. and about eleven came in &s;ight of another i&s;land, very large and very plea&s;ant, which happened to be an i&s;land they had pa&s;&s;ed before, and which they had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of Lord Sandwich's I&s;land.</P>
<P>23. Came in &s;ight of the famous i&s;le of Moni|colo, and &s;ailed along &s;hore N. W. and N. W. by N. It has a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, full of plantations, and all of them well fenced. They were frequently &s;o clo&s;e to &s;hore that they could hear the natives hollow to them. Being arrived nearly at the We&s;t end, they di&s;co|vered a pa&s;&s;age (the &s;ame they had pa&s;&s;ed be|fore two days after they had di&s;covered the&s;e i&s;lands); and night approaching, they &s;horten|ed &s;ail, and lay to. In the night many fires were &s;een on the i&s;land of Manic&ocirc;lo.</P>
<P>24. Cour&s;e N. N. W. through the &s;trait. The land to the we&s;tward &s;eemed to be of great extent, and very delightful. At four in the afternoon &s;aw another i&s;le, bearing N. half W. Tacked, and &s;tood to the S. E.</P>
<P>25. Tacked, and &s;teered to the N. W. Saw much land to the W. and S. W. At eleven entered a large deep bay; hauled up W. and W. S. W. The land at each extre|mity of this bay is very high: our journali&s;t has named it the bay of St. Philip and St. James, di&s;covered by Mindana in 1595. In this bay
<PB N="287" REF="300">
the Spaniards made a &s;ettlement, and laid the foundations of a city, to which they gave the name of New Jeru&s;alem; and to the two rivers between which it was &s;ituated they gave the names of Jordan and Salvador.</P>
<P>26. There being a fine breeze from the S. S. W. they &s;tood pretty well into the bay, the entrance to which lies N. by W. At two they hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and large cutter, armed them, and &s;ent them to &s;earch for an|chorage, in order to exchange their water taken in at Tanna, it proving very bad. While the boats were employed in examining the coa&s;t, three canoes came clo&s;e by the &s;hip, and &s;truck their &s;ails; but the men would not venture to come on board. The voyagers threw them &s;ome medals, cloth, and nails; the latter of which were mo&s;t joyfully received. In return they offered &s;ome plants of cinna|mon trees, which they had in their boats. They had likewi&s;e in their canoes long &s;pears, headed with the tail bones of the &s;tingray, but did not &s;hew the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to mi&s;chief. They were black and woolly-headed, (which by no means an&s;wers the de&s;cription which Quiros gives of the inhabitants about the bay of St. Philip and St. James, who are, accord|ing to that voyager, of a brown complexion,) and go naked, except a belt tied tight round their wai&s;ts, in like manner with the people
<PB N="288" REF="301">
before de&s;cribed. They are of the middle &s;ta|ture, and wear bracelets, as mo&s;t of the people in the&s;e i&s;lands do, but differ in one re&s;pect, by ornamenting their heads with plumes of feathers like the inhabitants of New Zealand. About four o'clock in the afternoon the boats returned, without being able to di&s;cover a wa|tering-place, or any &s;afe anchorage within the bay: they &s;aw, however, a large river, but no harbour within reach. Several of the inhabi|tants came in &s;ight, but were very &s;hy, and kept at a di&s;tance. Upon this intelligence they hoi&s;ted the boats on board, and made &s;ail out of the bay, at the mouth of which they lay off and on all night.</P>
<P>27. This day they began to u&s;e the water-engine to &s;weeten the water taken in at Tanna, and it had a very good effect.</P>
<P>28. Saw great numbers of fires in the night. The wind calm, made little or no way.</P>
<P>29. The calm continued.</P>
<P>30. At eight in the morning made &s;ail, and &s;tood in for land. Still little wind.</P>
<P>31. Saw two i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward, one of which extended to a great di&s;tance. At twelve tacked, and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>Sept. 1. No land in &s;ight.</P>
<P>2. This day one of the petty officers was put in irons for mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>3. The officer was relea&s;ed on his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="302">4. Came in &s;ight of land, bearing about E. and S. by E. Ship's head S. S. E. About twelve &s;aw the land more plain, large, and ex|ten&s;ive.</P>
<P>5. Worked well in with the land. Seeing 20 or 30 canoes &s;tanding towards the &s;hip, they thought it advi&s;eable to load the great guns, and to prepare for defence, in ca&s;e of oppo&s;ition. About eight they hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and large cutter, and &s;ent them for|wards to examine an opening which they ob|&s;erved in the reef. They returned, having &s;ound a clear pa&s;&s;age, and very regular &s;ound|ings, from eight and a half to five and a half fathoms water. At one the &s;hip came to an anchor within half a mile of the land. In le&s;s than half an hour the &s;hip was &s;urrounded with the natives, mo&s;tly armed with clubs, &s;pears, and &s;lings, the &s;tones of which were of the &s;ize of an egg, &s;mooth and round as if turned in an engine: they appeared, however, very peaceable, and &s;everal were admitted on board. They were mo&s;t of them, but not all, flat no&s;ed and woolly headed; of a middling &s;tature, and naked, except about their wai&s;ts. All the i&s;landers &s;een in this Archipelago are nearly naked alike, having no other clothing but a girdle, &s;ometimes of one fabric, &s;ometimes of another, drawn tight about their middles, and &s;o contrived as to cover them as low as the
<PB N="290" REF="303">
haunches. Some of the natives here, like tho&s;e of Ea&s;ter-I&s;land, have holes bored in their ears, and wear heavy ornaments in them, which draw them down to a frightful length; and &s;ome of them were punctuated with &s;prigs of flowers and other figures upon their brea&s;ts, arms, and legs. Their chiefs wear large black caps on their heads, and have ornaments of bone, tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, or mother of pearl, upon their arms.</P>
<P>Their canoes are all double, and &s;ail with two &s;ails made of matting. They are built with a room acro&s;s, which gives them the ap|pearance of large floating &s;tages, and are ca|pable of carrying a great number of men. They are not rowed with oars or paddles as mo&s;t other canoes are, but &s;kulled along with long poles flatted at the ends, and let down through holes between the boats, and with the&s;e they guide their ve&s;&s;els in &s;ailing or turn|ing. They u&s;e &s;traps for their &s;pears, &s;uch as are in u&s;e among the natives of Tanna, but more curiou&s;ly wrought. They &s;eem to be a warlike people, if one may be allowed to judge from the many deep &s;cars wherewith they are marked: but, what was remarkable, many of them appeared to be broken bellied, and not a few were blind of one eye.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was properly &s;ecured, the captain and &s;everal of the gentlemen went
<PB N="291" REF="304">
on &s;hore in the pinnace to e&s;tabli&s;h peace with the chiefs, who all &s;eemed very well di&s;po&s;ed; and when they returned, they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction at the manner of being received. Their hou&s;es were very different from any they had before &s;een, and were built in the form of beehives, with each two doors oppo|&s;ite one to the other, to let in the air, and let out the &s;moke, of which they &s;tunk mo&s;t abo|minably.</P>
<P>Their plantations are plea&s;ant beyond de|&s;cription, and are chiefly cultivated by the women, who likewi&s;e have the care of the children, and carry the burdens. They are more &s;lenderly covered in this i&s;land than in mo&s;t of the others, and differ very little in that re&s;pect from the men, and like them too are mo&s;tly black and woolly-headed.</P>
<P>The i&s;land does not abound in variety of fruits; but the gentlemen who went up into the country reported that they &s;aw wild-fowl in abundance, as well as tame. The captain made the chief who welcomed him on &s;hore, and who afterwards vi&s;ited him on board, a pre&s;ent of a &s;ow and boar, and of &s;ome other animals, males and females, of which they had none upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>6. The a&s;tronomer, with the captain and of|ficers, went to a &s;mall i&s;le adjoining to the main to ob&s;erve an eclip&s;e of the &s;un, which hap|pened
<PB N="292" REF="305">
between the hours of two and three in the afternoon; and it being a clear day, they had a fine opportunity of determining the time of its duration with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Having di&s;covered a clear &s;tream of running water, the carpenters and others were employ|ed in cutting down trees, and bu&s;hes, to make a rolling way to facilitate the labour of con|veying the water to the &s;ea-&s;ide. This was of infinite u&s;e, and &s;hortened the &s;hip's &s;tay &s;eve|ral days.</P>
<P>This day the &s;hip's butcher died of a hurt he received by falling down the hatchway the day before. One of the Indians &s;truck an un|common fi&s;h with a &s;pear, which was purcha|&s;ed by one of the officers, and pre&s;ented to the captain as a rarity, but it had the &s;ame effect with that eaten in Venomous-Bay, and made tho&s;e &s;ick who partook of it. The hog that eat the entrails died. The gentlemen, how|ever, &s;oon recovered.</P>
<P>7. The butcher was this day buried with the u&s;ual &s;ea &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>8. Mo&s;t of the people employed in water|ing.</P>
<P>9. The launch and large cutter were &s;ent to examine the coa&s;t, and to endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to find a pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hip, without going round the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="306">10. The boats, not returning, the captain began to be in pain for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>11. About eleven in the morning, the launch and large cutter were &s;een at a great di&s;tance, beating up to recover the &s;hip. About four in the afternoon &s;ome of the gentlemen, who went out in the boats, and who travelled over land a con&s;iderable way, came on board, and brought an account that the large cutter had &s;prung a leak; and that the launch had carried away her fore-yard; that the cutter had for|tunately reached the &s;hore, and &s;topped her leak; and that the launch had made &s;hift to &s;upply her lo&s;s, by a new contrivance, which nece&s;&s;ity had &s;ugge&s;ted; they likewi&s;e related the manner of their travelling acro&s;s the coun|try, and of the civility they received from the natives wherever they had occa&s;ion to refre&s;h, bringing them &s;ugar cane, and tarra-root, which the natives here call by the name of coao. In the cour&s;e of their journey, they pa&s;&s;ed by &s;e|veral of the burying places of their dead, which were equal in neatne&s;s and regularity to tho&s;e in the Society-i&s;les. In their plantations there were &s;everal low cocoa-nut-trees, as if but lately planted, and in the low mar&s;hes not a few mangroves. In the woods they &s;aw the marks of many fires, about which the &s;hells of fi&s;hes were &s;cattered in plenty; from whence it was conjectured that the natives lived chiefly
<PB N="294" REF="307">
upon &s;hell-fi&s;h, as neither bread-fruit, nor plantains &s;eemed to abound; and that tho&s;e yams that were brought to market were held very precious. The bread they chiefly u&s;e is made of the tender &s;hoots of a certain tree, not unlike to liquori&s;h root in colour and grain. The&s;e &s;tewed in an earthen pot, when ready, have much the &s;ame ta&s;te as roa&s;ted potatoes. In the evening the boats recovered the &s;hip, after a very fatiguing voyage, in which they were much incommoded by the weather.</P>
<P>12. This day the carpenter's mate, by the captain's order cut the following in&s;cription on a large tree, HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S SHIP RESOLUTION 1774. About three in the after|noon hoi&s;ted in the launch and &s;mall cutter, and prepared every thing in readine&s;s to &s;ail.</P>
<P>13. At &s;ix in the morning weighed anchor, and made &s;ail with the wind E. S. E. &s;teering to clear the pa&s;&s;age between the reefs, by which they entered the harbour. At eight bore away for the ea&s;t end of the i&s;le W. by N. and W. N. W. While they continued this cour&s;e, the dead man's cloaths were &s;old by auction as u&s;ual. At two in the afternoon, &s;aw an i&s;land bearing S. by E. at a great di&s;tance. At &s;even two more i&s;lands came in &s;ight, one bearing S. W. the other W. by N. Stood off and on all night.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="308">14. Tacked and &s;tood to the northward. The reef &s;till a head.</P>
<P>15. Bore away W. N. W. At eight tacked, &s;eeing the reef a head, and &s;tood S. E. by E. Wind E. by N. At two calm, the reef not above a league and a half di&s;tant, and a light breeze from the ea&s;tward, and a heavy &s;well from the northward, which &s;et in on the reef, alarmed the whole crew with the apprehen|&s;ion of danger, which was not a little increa&s;ed by a dead calm that immediately &s;ucceeded, the &s;hip's drift being right in upon the reef. The pinnace and large cutter, as the only means under Providence to &s;ave the &s;hip, were hoi&s;ted out with that alertne&s;s by which the crew of the Re&s;olution were di&s;tingui&s;hed, and both being employed in towing the &s;hip off, with inconceivable labour, in which tho&s;e who were engaged were relieved every two hours, they cleared the reef, but not till the next day.</P>
<P>16. The boats &s;till towing:&mdash;about eight in the morning the reef was &s;een at a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance; and about eleven, a breeze &s;pringing up from the S. by W. the pinnace and cutter were hoi&s;ted on board, and the &s;hip made &s;ail to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>17. They now began to direct their cour&s;e to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, and it was &s;oon conjec|tured by the &s;hip's company that the place to which they were bound was New-Zealand; but

it was not till the 21&s;t that they cleared the land. This i&s;land mu&s;t therefore be of con|&s;iderable extent, and was perhaps that great country which the Indian Chief told Quiros lay to the &s;outhward, and which Quiros might mi&s;interpret, by &s;uppo&s;ing it Monic&ocirc;la, which is &s;mall in compari&s;on to the great-country meant. Be this as it may, it does not appear that any European ve&s;&s;el ever before vi&s;ited this i&s;land, to which Capt. Cooke gave the name of New Caledonia; it is &s;ituated partly between the 19th and 22d degree of &s;outh-latitude, and in long. 165 deg. 50 min. E. and at a di&s;tance appears very lofty and mountain|ous. Its extent from north to &s;outh full 90 leagues. From ea&s;t to we&s;t unknown.</P>
<P>On the 24th, about &s;our in the afternoon, &s;teering E. S. E. they came in &s;ight of two &s;mall i&s;les off the Ea&s;t point of the great i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 25th they bore away S. by W. and &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall i&s;les to the ea&s;tward of the main. At three in the afternoon changed their cour&s;e E. S. E. Saw white water a-head, and hauled up to the Ea&s;t. The&s;e i&s;les were full of trees, and &s;ome of them had the appear|ance of &s;tatues, &s;uch as were &s;een on Ea&s;ter-I&s;land. Caught two &s;harks that were be&s;poke before taken. To &s;ailors who are not accu&s;|tomed to dainties, the fle&s;h of the&s;e creatures,
<PB N="297" REF="312">
when cleared of the fat, is very good meat; and their inte&s;tines not much inferior to ha&s;e|let, which by &s;ome is accounted a delicacy. Hoi&s;ted out the &s;mall cutter to try the current, but found none. Light breezes from the land. Tacked every two hours during the night.</P>
<P>26. Saw great flocks of birds, but at &s;uch a di&s;tance as not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h to what cla&s;s they belonged. Stood to S. W.</P>
<P>27. Tacked, and &s;tood to the S. E. clo&s;e under the i&s;le &s;een on the 23d to to the ea&s;tward of the main. It pre&s;ented a mo&s;t beautiful land&s;cape: the trees &s;eemed ranged in lines, and being nearly of a height, and the hills and lawns diver&s;ifying the pro&s;pect, nothing in na|ture could appear more delightful, except that water was wanting to compleat the picture. Stood off and on all night.</P>
<P>28. Saw the i&s;land on their lee-beam. Wind E. S. E. a &s;tiff gale. Cour&s;e S. W. and S. S. W. At eight tacked, and &s;tood N. N. W. At eleven the man at the ma&s;t head called aloud HIGH LAND. About one in the afternoon &s;aw the land from the deck extending as far as the eye could carry, bear|ing W. S. W. and W. by S. Hauled up to the S. W. by S. When they hauled up, the beautiful i&s;land they had ju&s;t quitted bore about E. half N. di&s;tance &s;ix leagues; and the high land in &s;ight bore about N. N. W. di&s;|tance
<PB N="298" REF="313">
eight or nine leagues. At four &s;aw breakers almo&s;t all round them. Tacked, and &s;tood to the North, that being the cleare&s;t pa&s;|&s;age. At five tacked again, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. About five &s;teered to the North-Ea&s;t, and N. E. by N. Sounded, and got every thing in readine&s;s to ca&s;t anchor in forty fathom water; but the wind blowing hard, and the breakers and &s;hoals multiplying about them, pre&s;ented nothing but danger; it was therefore determined to bear away, and to take &s;helter under the lee of a &s;mall i&s;le about four leagues from the High Land, where they dropped anchor in thirty-nine fathom water, fine &s;helly bottom.</P>
<P>29. The captain and gentlemen went on &s;hore, and found that the i&s;land was frequent|ed by the Indians, who had made many fires in the woods, about which lay &s;cattered the bones and &s;hells of fi&s;h: they found likewi&s;e two canoes buried in the &s;and upon the beach, and the callipee of a turtle at &s;ome di&s;tance from the water's edge. They found no water upon the i&s;land; but, after a fruitle&s;s &s;earch, return|ed on board very much fatigued: the carpen|ters, however, were &s;ent on &s;hore, who cut eight or nine &s;traight &s;pars, which were much wanted; and having made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary re|pairs in the ma&s;ts and rigging,</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="314">On the 30th they weighed anchor, and nar|rowly e&s;caped tumbling upon a &s;unken rock, which they di&s;covered ju&s;t under their lee-bow. Steering to the South-Ea&s;t, they di&s;covered that the High Land already mentioned was a part of New Caledonia, which they di&s;covered on the 4th in&s;tant: they therefore kept on their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Oct. 1. Sailed with great caution, the &s;ea being full of reefs and &s;unken rocks. At ten they lo&s;t &s;ight of land, and then made all the &s;ail they could E. by S. Tacked, and &s;tood to the S. W. and at twelve tacked again, and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, probably in &s;earch of &s;ome new land.</P>
<P>2. Cour&s;e in the morning E. and E. S. E. a great &s;well from the &s;outhward. At eleven &s;aw &s;ome man of war birds. Cour&s;e S. by W.</P>
<P>3. Cour&s;e S. by E. the weather &s;qually.</P>
<P>4. Stood S. and S. by E. Saw a few birds.</P>
<P>5. Steered S. S E. the whole day. Lat. at noon 26 deg. 31 min.</P>
<P>6. At five in the morning tacked, and &s;tood W. S. W. The weather being fine, and the gentlemen &s;eeing many birds about the &s;hip, ordered out the boat, and went a-&s;hoot|ing. About two in the afternoon they return|ed, having killed four large albatro&s;&s;es, and &s;everal &s;mall birds. About five hoi&s;ted in the

boat, and continued their cour&s;e the whole night.</P>
<P>7. Stood to the S. W. all day. Wind S. S. E.</P>
<P>8. At twelve at noon &s;tood S. W. by. S. At five they &s;truck a &s;mall porpoi&s;e, as the &s;ailors imagined; but, having pur&s;ued and brought it aboard, the naturali&s;ts were divid|ed; and, by the mo&s;t knowing, it was &s;aid to be an ancient dolphin.</P>
<P>9. Cour&s;e this day W. S. W. Struck ano|ther of the above fi&s;h, and broke the harpoon in him clo&s;e to the &s;ockets. The former be|ing dre&s;&s;ed proved very good meat.</P>
<P>10. At five in the morning came in &s;ight of land, bearing about S. And S. S. W. at &s;ix it appeared high and full of trees; neared it very fa&s;t, and all the morning employed in working under the lee of the i&s;le: at one, being clo&s;e by it, they hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and large cutter, and the captain with two of his lieutenants went on &s;hore to reconnoitre the coa&s;t, and at the &s;ame time taking the carpenter's crow along with them to fell &s;ome trees, of which there were abundance large enough for ma&s;ts for third-rate men of war, and others fit for yards, bolt&s;prits, and all other u&s;es about the &s;hip. They met with no inhabitants, nor any ob&s;truction whatever. The woods abounded with parrots and parro|quetes, pidgeons, and other birds; but they
<PB N="301" REF="316">
found no water. The i&s;land appeared broken, and barren in many places; but in the vallies between the hills nothing could look more beautiful. At five in the afternoon the boats came in from the &s;hore, the carpenters having felled what trees were wanted for u&s;e, which being &s;hipped on board, the boats were hoi&s;t|ed in, and the &s;hip &s;tretched away to the ea&s;t|ward, with intent to go to the windward of the i&s;le. In this cour&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall unin|habited i&s;land, on which there grew abundance of cabbage trees; of the&s;e the &s;hip's crew made the proper u&s;e. About eight in the evening the middle of the large i&s;land bore South half We&s;t &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>11. Still endeavouring to get to the wind|ward of the i&s;land. Wind at E. and S. by E. Cour&s;e South. At ten the two i&s;les made into one, latitude at noon 29 deg. 27 min. Cour&s;e S. S. E. Sounded in 33 fathom water; but the breeze favouring, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e, after giving a name to the i&s;land, and calling it Norfolk I&s;le. Lat. 28 deg. 58 min. and long. 167 deg. 30 min. E. by ob&s;ervation.</P>

<P>17. Came in &s;ight of land, bearing S. E. by E. half E. It proved to be Cape-Egmont, in New-Zealand, almo&s;t covered with &s;now. Sounded and made all the &s;ail they could to the S. E. by S.

birth. At two hoi&s;ted our the large and &s;mall cutter, and &s;ent them on &s;hore, to &s;ee if the bottle had been removed, that was left with directions for the Adventure. They returned, and brought word, that the tree, under which it was depo&s;ited, had been cut down, and the bottle taken away, but whether by the na|tives, or by the Adventure's crew, they could not determine. They hauled the &s;eine, but could catch no fi&s;h; but gathered &s;curvy-gra&s;s and wild cellery in plenty, which were no le&s;s acceptable. Here the fowlers kill wild fowl in abundance, and the crew being almo&s;t all of them in health, were little le&s;s rejoiced than if they had arrived on the coa&s;t of Eng|land.</P>
<P>19. They moored the &s;hip, and &s;ent the tents a&s;hore; began to cut down wood and prepare for watering; but wondered that none of the natives came in &s;ight. The&s;e &s;avages undoubtedly imagined that the &s;hip was come to revenge the death of the Adventure's men, whom they had killed and eaten; but being &s;oon relieved from that dread, they came about the &s;hip as u&s;ual, bringing fi&s;h, and whatever el&s;e the i&s;land produced, and behaving in &s;eeming|ly a friendly manner.</P>
<P>Here the &s;hip's crew pitched their tents as u&s;ual, and all hands were employed in repairs of various kinds; the gentlemen in reconnoi|tring
<PB N="304" REF="319">
the country, and the captain in &s;urvey|ing the Sound, in which he di&s;covered a pa&s;|&s;age leading into the main ocean through &s;eve|ral channels, 12 or 13 leagues from the en|trance of the Sound. While the pinnace was employed in this di&s;covery, &s;he was dogged the whole day by a large double canoe, which however, did not dare to attack her, though encouraged by the &s;avages on &s;hore, who heav|ed &s;tones at the pinnace, but did not reach her.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, who went out a-&s;hooting, found a hog upon Long-i&s;land, left there, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the Adventure; &s;he was very wild, and took to the woods as &s;oon as di&s;co|vered. Several of the crew went afterwards to hunt her, but without effect.</P>
<P>During their intercour&s;e with the natives, they were given to under&s;tand that a &s;hip had been ca&s;t away upon the coa&s;t; and that the natives had overcome the people, had killed them, and eat them.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before their departure, &s;everal &s;trange Indians came rowing down the Sound, having a variety of articles, the produce of the coun|try, to di&s;po&s;e of; &s;ome curiou&s;ly wrought in ja&s;per, &s;ome in wood; and not a few in reeds and matting. Some of their country cloth they brought likewi&s;e and exhanged for Otta|heite cloth, and cocoa-nut &s;hells, of which la&s;t
<PB N="305" REF="320">
they were very fond, and of which there were &s;ome thou&s;ands on board. The&s;e &s;avages had with them &s;even or eight young red painted blue-lip'd cannibal ladies, who were by no means unwilling to be introduced to the com|pany of &s;uch of the &s;hip's crew as fancied them. The gunner's mate, who had been confined in irons for endeavouring to leave the &s;hip at Ot|taheite, was here puni&s;hed with twelve la&s;hes for going a&s;hore without leave in pur&s;uit of one of tho&s;e beauties.</P>
<P>After &s;taying in this harbour from the 19th of October, till the 10th of November, and after taking in their full quantity of wood and water for a long run, they weighed anchor, and made &s;ail with a fine breeze, blowing right out of the harbour.</P>
<P>On the 12th of November they cleared the land, and &s;teering a S. S. E. cour&s;e, till they came into the 53d degree of &s;outhern latitude, they continued in that parallel nearly till they came in &s;ight of land between the &s;traits of Ma|gellan and Cape-Horn. In this long run, and in this high latitude, they met with not the lea&s;t ob&s;truction; they were favoured by wind and weather; for, from the time of their de|parture on the 12th of November, till their &s;eeing land on the 17th of December, the wea|ther, con&s;idering the climate, was moderately warm, and wind not unfavourable.</P>

<P>On the 17th came in &s;ight of land, which proved the &s;outh &s;ide of Terra del Fuego, very rugged, and full of &s;now. There appeared, however, a great many i&s;les and entrances;
<PB N="307" REF="324">
but the whole country pre&s;ented neither tree nor &s;hrub.</P>
<P>On the 18th, being in lat. 53 deg. 51 min. they came in &s;ight of a flock of birds that ex|tended for more than two miles; at the &s;ame time a great many &s;hags came flying about the &s;hip. Lat. this day at noon 53 deg. 51 min. Long. 287 deg.</P>
<P>19. Bore away E. by S. and coa&s;ted along &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of about five or &s;ix leagues. It &s;till appeared craggy and mountainous, and covered with &s;now; no trees or bu&s;hes, but the rocks re&s;ounding with the cries of &s;ea-fowl, and birds of various kinds. At ten in the morn|ing &s;ounded in 45 fathom water, cour&s;e gra|vel. At half pa&s;t four in the afternoon, tack|ed, and &s;tood right in for the &s;hore, &s;ome part of which looked not unlike a large i&s;land of ice, except in magnitude and extent.</P>
<P>20. About one in the afternoon the &s;outhern head, known by the name of Cape-Horn, came in &s;ight, &s;ounded in 45 fathom water, &s;andy bottom. Lat. 55 deg. 10 min. Stood in for the land, which appeared barren as a de&s;art; but the weather being clear and moderate, the whales were &s;porting, and throwing up the wa|ter like &s;o many fountains, all along the coa&s;t. Di&s;covered a fine bay, and &s;tood towards it, but there being little wind, hoi&s;ted out the pinnace, the large and &s;mall cutters, and tow|ed
<PB N="308" REF="325">
clo&s;e in &s;hore; and about nine at night came to an anchor in 25 fathom water.</P>
<P>21. Sent the boats out to &s;earch for water, who in the afternoon returned, having &s;ucceed|ed. Some of the officers who were on board the boats killed a great number of wild gee&s;e, not indeed &s;o large as the gee&s;e in England, but much hand&s;omer. On their report the &s;hip un|moored, and when &s;teadied again, &s;he was land|locked on every &s;ide, &s;o that no wind could blow to hurt her. On reconnoitring the coun|try, they found a &s;mall quantity of wild cel|lery, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, di&s;|covered trees, the bark of which ta&s;ted like pepper. The&s;e trees, have obtained the name of Winterania Aromatica, in compliment per|haps to Capt. Winter, who was the fir&s;t who brought a quantity of their bark from the &s;traits of Magellan into England. There are trees, however, of a &s;imilar kind in almo&s;t every i&s;|land in the We&s;t-Indies, the bark, fruit, and leaves of which have a fine aromatic flavour, and are u&s;ed both in food and phy&s;ic. What appears remarkable, is, that trees &s;o like in quality, &s;hould grow in &s;uch oppo&s;ite climates; and yet that tho&s;e which grew in the We&s;t-In|dies can by no &s;ort of culture be brought to live in England, except in the &s;tove.</P>
<P>Though the &s;hips that pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits of Magellan, experienced great hard&s;hips in na|vigating
<PB N="309" REF="326">
that narrow &s;ea, and were expo&s;ed to innumerable dangers, owing to the &s;trong tides, and uncertain weather, yet our naviga|tors, by rounding Cape Horn, e&s;caped all the&s;e inconveniences. The weather was fine, though &s;omewhat cold, and, by a diligent &s;earch, they found wood as well as water, &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply their wants.</P>
<P>While the crew was employed in cutting wood, and filling water, the captain was vigi|lant in examining the coa&s;t. About five or &s;ix miles from the place where the &s;hip rode at anchor, he came to a cove, where he found the frame of a wigwam, or two, in which &s;ome Indians had formerly re&s;ted, and where they had made a fire, and fea&s;ted upon &s;hell fi&s;h. He likewi&s;e met with &s;ome &s;ea-fowl that could not fly, but fluttered upon the &s;urface of the water, as fa&s;t as thought, and were &s;uch ready divers, that though the captain, and the gen|tlemen who accompanied him, fired &s;everal times, and hit the very &s;pot on which they were fluttering, yet they never could kill one of them.</P>
<P>While the &s;hip lay at anchor in this bay, one William Wedgborough, a marine, was mi&s;&s;ing, and no body could give any account of him. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 22d of December, he was drinking in company with three or four more of his comrades, and after that he was never &s;een; he was a fine hearty
<PB N="310" REF="327">
jolly fellow, about 24 years of age, and well re&s;pected by all his corps. This is rather worth noticeing, as the writer of the former voyage gives a &s;imilar account of a marine, who on being reproached by his company for a trifling theft committed in joke, made away with him&s;elf much about the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>Two or three days after the arrival of the &s;hip a canoe came in &s;ight, with a family of the natives paddling between the i&s;les, pro|bably gathering limpets and &s;hell-fi&s;h. They took little or no notice of the &s;hip, and kept at a di&s;tance; but, in le&s;s than a week, &s;everal other boats appeared, and &s;ome of the Indians ventured to come on board. They were not &s;uch mi&s;erable beings as has been repre&s;ented. They were indeed naked, all but a &s;eal &s;kin thrown carele&s;sly round their &s;houlders, and pinned upon their brea&s;ts with a kind of &s;kewer; but they were not dejected.</P>
<P>Some had ornamented their heads with fea|thers made up in various forms; but every other part of their bodies, except their backs, was without covering, women as well as men. They bore, notwith&s;tanding, a very healthy appearance; and, except a continual &s;hiver|ing, which perhaps was natural to them, they made no bad figure.</P>
<P>They were painted of a dark kind of red or copper colour from head to foot, intermixed
<PB N="311" REF="328">
with &s;treaks of other colours upon their arms and thighs.</P>
<P>Their wigwams were only temporary dwel|lings, made of the &s;lender boughs of trees, arched over like &s;o many arbours, and covered with the branches and leaves of the winter's bark tree. In the&s;e they make their fires, and dre&s;s their meat. In one of them that had been de&s;erted on the approach of a party of &s;ailors, there was the leg of a goo&s;e ready dre&s;&s;ed, and the remains of &s;ome fi&s;h, on which, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, they had dined. Their canoes differ but little from tho&s;e of the other Americans: they are made of the bark of large trees, put together with great labour, and covered with &s;eal-&s;kins: they differ much from the canoes in the Tropical I&s;lands, being very wide in proportion to their length, and having a quantity of earth in them, on which, in their fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons, they make their fires. It &s;hould &s;eem that the&s;e canoes are each the property of a &s;eparate family, for in every canoe there were women and chil|dren.</P>
<P>The men did not expre&s;s either fear or wonder on coming on board: but their rea&s;on for hiding them&s;elves on &s;hore &s;eemed to be le&s;t their women and children &s;hould be taken from them and carried into captivity; a dread which runs through the whole human race, let
<PB N="312" REF="329">
their &s;ituation be ever &s;o mean, in the place of their nativity. Their language is hoar&s;e and guttural.</P>
<P>Orders were given, that no purcha&s;e &s;hould be made with them, without giving them clothing in exchange: but there was nothing of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that they would not &s;ell; their bows and arrows, their &s;pears, their fi&s;hing-tackle, their uten&s;ils of every kind, all came to market. Whatever was given them to a&s;&s;uage their hunger they would eat voraciou&s;ly; and whenever they went off from the &s;hip they never failed to entertain the company with a dance.</P>
<P>Here the &s;hip's company kept their Chri&s;t|mas jovially; and it was not till after &s;ome days that they could be brought to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>While they remained at anchor, the people on board were in no want of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, they found wild-fowl in &s;uch abundance that numbers of them were killed and &s;alted down for future u&s;e, and not a few kept alive, e&s;pe|cially gee&s;e; and of &s;curvy-gra&s;s and wild|celery they were in no want, after the country came to be better known. It being the height of &s;ummer, they found meadows that might have been mowed, and the gra&s;s made into hay; and there were many plants and flowers that were exceeding beautiful, and totally un|known to our European botani&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="330">The repairs being at length compleated, and wood and water &s;upplied, on the 27th of De|cember the &s;hip prepared to &s;ail; and on the 28th they weighed and put to &s;ea. Their cour&s;e out of the bay, to which they gave the name of Chri&s;tmas Sound, was S. by E. and S. S. E. Its latitude 54 deg. 24 min. accord|ing to our journali&s;t's reckoning; by the a&s;tro|nomer's 55 deg. 26 min. It long by the former, 289 deg. 00 min. by the latter, 289 deg. 54 min. Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 29th Cape Horn, bearing N. 88 deg. Ea&s;t di&s;tance five or &s;ix leagues, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e to the N. E. by N. and N. N. E. half E. till they came off Succe&s;s-Bay, where the Endeavour anchored in her former voyage, and where the pre&s;ent naviga|tors had appointed to rendezvous in ca&s;e of &s;e|paration from the Adventure: they therefore hoi&s;ted the large cutter out to make &s;earch if any token had been left of that &s;hip's anchor|ing there; but no &s;uch token having been found, they returned, after cutting the &s;hip's name and date of the year on a large tree ad|joining to the &s;trand. While this was doing, they &s;aw thirty or forty of the natives, who came out of the woods to welcome them on &s;hore, one of whom the &s;ailors remember|ed. He made motions for knives, but there were &s;carce any on board. The people
<PB N="314" REF="331">
here &s;eemed rather &s;touter than tho&s;e about Chri&s;tmas Sound; but made no figure as giants.</P>
<P>30. They now directed their cour&s;e to Staten's Land, in the pa&s;&s;age to which the whales were &s;o numerous and large that the crew thought them&s;elves in danger of the &s;hip's being over&s;et by them: penguins and &s;eals were likewi&s;e in plenty.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t nine in the morning they bore away S. E. and got clo&s;e under a plea&s;ant long i&s;le, which appeared to be clothed with a verdure equal to any they had yet &s;een. At half pa&s;t ten they heard a great noi&s;e, like the lowing of many cattle, but &s;oon found that it was the roaring of the &s;ea-lions that harboured upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>31. At half after one came too between the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Green I&s;land, and the We&s;t &s;ide of Staten Land; di&s;tance about three leagues from each. About one the boats were hoi&s;ted out, and about 40 of the crew, armed with mu&s;kets and Am&s;terdam clubs, ha&s;tened to &s;hore to kill &s;eals. As &s;oon as the boats landed, the people on board could &s;ee the engagement, which was very hot &s;o long as it la&s;ted. In&s;tead of &s;eals they found an innu|merable herd of lions and lione&s;&s;es ba&s;king on the beach; and in a very &s;hort time they &s;ent the large cutter back with &s;everal old ones,
<PB N="315" REF="332">
and above 200 young ones. At &s;even in the evening the other boats came off with another freight. Some of the old lions weighed from 700 to 800 lb. weight. The young ones are about the &s;ize of large bull-dogs. During the whole time of the engagement there were from 30 to 40 lions in the water clo&s;e by the launch, roaring, jumping, and &s;tanding upright, but afraid to land. The&s;e lions yield va&s;t quantities of oil; but are very hard to kill, &s;ome of hte large lions having gone off with eight or ten balls in their heads. Some of them mea&s;ured from eight to nine feet in length, and not le&s;s round the &s;houlders. Their feet, or what the &s;ailors call their phippers, mea&s;ured from two feet and a half to three feet and a half in length. They have the appearance of lions as they ba&s;k upon the roks; but when lying on the beach, they look more like flocks of &s;heep, with 20 or 30 large black rams among them. By the de&s;cription here given of them they &s;eem to differ much from tho&s;e found in the North Seas.&mdash;Some of the gentlemen who went up into the country &s;aw bears; but time was wanting to encounter them. This i&s;land is entirely covered with coar&s;e long gra&s;s, through which the tracks of &s;ea and land|mon&s;ters may be traced for many miles. Turkies, bu&s;tards, and hawks, were &s;een upon this i&s;land, and &s;everal gee&s;e were killed upon
<PB N="316" REF="333">
it. In the evening the boats were hoi&s;ted in, and the people employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the butcher in cutting the blubber form the lions, and ca&s;king it up.</P>
<P>Jan. 1. The whole day was &s;pent in killing lions, penguins, gee&s;e, and teals: every little cove upon the Green I&s;land was covered with them. The penguins are accounted good eating; and thou&s;ands of them were killed for that purpo&s;e. It is de&s;perate work to encoun|ter the lions, without fir&s;t firing two or three balls into them; for they will &s;pring two or three yards at their a&s;&s;ailants when they find them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>2. While the &s;hip rode in this channel the pinnace was hoi&s;ted out to reconnoitre the We&s;t coa&s;t of Staten Land, and brought word that they had di&s;covered a &s;afe harbour, in which the whole royal navy of England might anchor in &s;afety, and find wood, water, and wild-fowl, &s;ufficient to &s;upply their wants.</P>
<P>3. The &s;hip's cooks boiled no le&s;s than 300 wild-fowl this day for the &s;hip's company, as every one was at liberty to eat what he plea&s;ed. Several went upon the doctor's li&s;t, more it &s;hould &s;eem from gluttony and intemperance than from the effects of the climate.</P>
<P>4. Came to &s;ail, the weather &s;ine, temperate, and the &s;un &s;hining bright, proceeded with a bri&s;k breeze E. S. E.</P>

white heads, and yellow feet. Lat. at noon 54 deg. 05 min. At four &s;ounded, and found ground at 18 fathom, muddy bottom. Cour&s;e S. by E. Saw the land extending a great way to the northward of the peak, mi&s;taken in the morning for an ice i&s;land.</P>
<P>15. The weather hazy, attended with &s;leet and &s;now, and exce&s;&s;ive cold. Lo&s;t &s;ight of land; but certain to be at no great di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P>16. The land bore Ea&s;t. It appeared amaz|ingly lofty, mountainous, craggy, and almo&s;t covered with &s;now. It now &s;eemed to extend farther to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward than the eye could carry. At twelve bore away N. N. W. The nearer they approached the land, the more rugged and craggy it appeared, differing in nothing from that of Terra del Fuego on the we&s;tern &s;ide, but in being cover|ed with &s;now. At twelve the extremes of the land were from N. by E. half E. to N. 2 by E. half E. Latitude 54 deg. 25 min. At three &s;teered through a &s;trait or pa&s;&s;age three or four leagues in breadth, between &s;everal &s;mall i&s;les and the main. In this pa&s;&s;age many green patches were &s;een upon the land; and the greate&s;t part of the &s;ea coa&s;t was clear from &s;now. While they continued &s;ailing to the North Ea&s;tward, the land &s;eemed in that di|rection to have no end; in&s;omuch that all the
<PB N="319" REF="336">
mariners on board were overjoyed, imagining they had now found the Southern-Continent of which they came in &s;earch. Having cleared the &s;trait, they &s;tood E. by N. the land not above three leagues di&s;tant. At nine at night hove too.</P>
<P>17. At half after three bore away S. E. by E. Wind S. W. at four cour&s;e E. half S. the land &s;till winding ea&s;tward. At &s;even haul|ed up S. S. E. &s;eeing a fine bay to ca&s;t anchor, &s;ounded in 45 fathom water, blue mud, and &s;mall &s;tones. At nine hoi&s;ted out the large cutter, and went on &s;hore with a &s;tand of co|lours. Latitude 54 deg. S. long. 322 deg. 32 min. E. As &s;oon as they landed, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country in the name of their Royal Ma&s;ter, and hoi&s;ting an Engli&s;h Jack, fired three volley's of fire-arms, and chri&s;ten|ed the country GEORGIA. In this bay they found an excellent harbour, had not the head of it been frozen up. The &s;ea fowl which &s;wam in the mouth of the harbour were quite tame; but two mon&s;ters which lay on the beech were frightfully fierce. They were in their ge|neral &s;hape not much unlike the &s;ea lions of Green-I&s;land, but much larger; they killed one of them that mea&s;ured 18 feet, and every way large in proportion; his head re&s;embled the head of a &s;hark, his eyes were fixed in the upper part of his head, and his phippers were
<PB N="320" REF="337">
armed with claws. He was &s;hot with intent to make a drawing of him. They met with no interruption from the inhabitants, nor any thing that could invite their &s;tay. At half af|ter one the boat returned with the mon&s;ter on board, and at two they made &s;ail &s;teering E. S. E.</P>
<P>From this time till the 7th of February, they continued coa&s;ting this great country without &s;eeing one inhabitant. They had already run from New-Zealand to Cape-Horn, mo&s;tly in 53 and 54; &s;o that in that direction, this land cannot extend beyond that line to the north|ward, how far &s;oever it may run to the &s;outh|ward; nor can it, from the 318th degree of ea&s;tern longitude, to the 360th, run farther to the northward than the parallel in which it was fir&s;t di&s;covered, namely, in 54 S. nor indeed &s;o far, for Capt. Cooke, quitting this new di&s;|covered coa&s;t in lat. 58, run in that direction to the longitude of London, and &s;everal de|grees farther. Whatever therefore its extent may be, as no doubt it is very great, if we may be allowed to judge from the a&s;toni&s;hing height of its mountains, there can no part of it be habitable by Europeans; for as the whole circuit of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere has now been navigated in two or three parallels of high latitude, there can be no place for it within tho&s;e parallels. It is not improbable that it

may ri&s;e to the northward, from a narrow neck, and &s;pread as it opens to the &s;outhward, to a va&s;t extent; but it can never be a country of any con&s;iderable commerce, except, like Hug|&s;on's-Bay, for furs, down, and &s;kins. It is not, however, likely that it &s;hould be de&s;titute of inhabitants, though we do not find that any were &s;een upon it; nor did the people on board perceive any &s;igns of cultivation, though the &s;hip &s;ailed frequently within two or three leagues of land; it every where appeared rocky and mountainous; but in &s;ome places the mountains ro&s;e higher than even Mr. Fo&s;ter, who had traver&s;ed the mo&s;t mountainous parts of Europe, had ever before beheld. Our jour|nali&s;t has given a drawing of one, among many others, which, he &s;ays, ro&s;e &s;eventeen miles above the horizon, and who&s;e top reached higher than the clouds. It was &s;ituated about the 59th degree of &s;outhern latitude, and in ea&s;t longitude 330 deg. nearly.</P>
<P>By the cour&s;e they &s;teered, the &s;hore ap|pears to be very irregular, but in general trend|ing to the &s;outh ea&s;t, as far as the mountains ju&s;t mentioned, though they coa&s;ted it along in almo&s;t all directions, from the 14th of Ja|nuary to the 7th of February, when having lo&s;t &s;ight of it for two or three days, the wea|ther being piercing cold, and the crew but poorly clad, the captain gave orders to &s;tand
<PB N="322" REF="340">
to the ea&s;t. It is much to be regretted, that &s;o little regard is paid by contractors, to the quality of the articles they furni&s;h, that few of them are intrin&s;ically worth half what the poor men are charged for them. In this voyage, the &s;hoes in particular were &s;o intolerably bad, that when the rain, &s;now, or &s;leet, fell upon the decks, which either one or the other did almo&s;t every day in this crui&s;e, one might wring the &s;hoes like a piece of flannel; and they were of no more &s;ervice in keeping the feet warm than if they had been made of woollen rags; for the lea&s;t moi&s;ture penetrated the very &s;oles. The reader may judge then how uncomforta|ble it mu&s;t be for poor men to &s;tand for hours together, with wet feet, in &s;uch rigorous climates.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the horrid appearance the different views of the land exhibited, and the workings, and bearings of the &s;hip, nothing remarkable hap|pened in the long crui&s;e, of which we have been &s;peaking, except that on the third of Fe|bruary, three or four days before they left the land, they pa&s;&s;ed through a portion of &s;ea, the water of which was as white as milk; this was about the 59th degree of latitude, and at no great di&s;tance from the tow'ring mountains al|ready noticed: They &s;ounded, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;hip in &s;hallow water; but found no bottom. The water, when taken up in a bucket, and compared with other water, retained none of
<PB N="323" REF="341">
its milky colour, but &s;howed in every re&s;pect like the ordinary &s;ea-water. This, however, is not the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation of the kind; others have noticed the like phoenomenon.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip took her departure from this continent, February 7, her longitude was 341 deg. E. and her lat. 58 deg. S. nearly, and on that day &s;he compleated her circuit round the globe, being then in the longitude of the Cape of Good Hope, from whence they &s;et out. In this latitude &s;he continued to &s;ail without any material deviation till the 15th of February, when the captain changed the cour&s;e, &s;teering a little more to the northward, in &s;earch of Bouvet's-Land, and traver&s;ed from the 57th to the 54th degree, till the 19th, when in lati|tude 54 deg. they fell in with many &s;igns of land, but next day all tho&s;e &s;igns di&s;appeared. They then bore away E. by N. deviating, how|ever, in many directions as &s;igns and circum|&s;tances aro&s;e, till on the 13th of March, in lat. 41 deg. 57 min. Long. 24 deg. E. they began to crui&s;e for two i&s;lands, &s;aid to have been &s;een nearly in that &s;ituation; but, not &s;ucceeding, they continued their cour&s;e to the Cape of Good-Hope. In their way, however, a quarrel aro&s;e between three of the principal officers, and the &s;hip's cooks, which was not re|conciled without very &s;erious con&s;equences. Tho&s;e three gentlemen, upon &s;ome occa&s;ion or
<PB N="324" REF="342">
other, entered the cook-room with naked knives, and with oaths, unbecoming their character, &s;wore they would take away the lives of the fir&s;t who dared to affront them. It &s;eems they had formerly met with &s;ome rebuffs for too much frequenting the cook's apartments, which had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed in joke; but now a regular comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">t was laid before the cap|tain, of their unwarrantable behaviour, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> men were in of their lives; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> complaint the captain was under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of enquiring; and, upon finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, of confining the offenders in irons. While they were in this &s;ituation, the articles of war being read, it was found that the of|fence was of &s;uch a nature as hardly to be determined without reference to a ccourt mar|tial, in order to which the two who appeared mo&s;t culpable, were continued pri&s;oners upon parole, and the third cleared.</P>
<P>In a day or two after this bu&s;ine&s;s had en|gro&s;&s;ed the captain's attention, he called the &s;hip's crew together, and, after recounting the particulars of the voyage, the hard&s;hips they had met with, the fatigues they had undergone, and the chearfulne&s;s which they had &s;hewn in the di&s;charge of their duty; he gave them to under&s;tand, how much more it would recom|mend them to the notice of the Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, if they would pre|&s;erve
<PB N="325" REF="343">
a profound &s;ilence in the ports they had yet to pa&s;s, with regard to the cour&s;es they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and the di&s;coveries they had made, and after their return home till they had receiv|ed permi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do; requiring at the &s;ame time, all tho&s;e officers who had kept journals to deliver them into his cu&s;tody, to be &s;ealed up in a che&s;t, not to be opened till delivered to their lord&s;hips at the proper office. This reque&s;t was chearfully complied with by every commi&s;&s;ioned officer: but &s;ome who had kept memorials merely by way of exerci&s;e, and to qualify them&s;elves for future preferment, not thinking their performances perfect enough to be laid before per&s;onages of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, re&s;erved their labours to gratify the cu|rio&s;ity of their friends. Of this kind is the journal now &s;ubmitted to the public, which, however defective in point of intelligence, is true in what relates to the conduct of the voyage throughout. It were of little moment to acquaint the reader with the rea&s;ons which prevailed with the journali&s;t to &s;uffer his fir&s;t imperfect e&s;&s;ay to fall into the hands of a book&s;eller; let it &s;uffice to a&s;&s;ure him, that the facts are true, how uncourtly &s;oever they may be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>They had now been near 40 days in their pa&s;&s;age from Georgia to the Cape of Good Hope without &s;eeing land; and before they arrived on the coa&s;t of Africa they fell in with
<PB N="326" REF="344">
two &s;hips &s;tanding W. S. W. without being able to &s;peak with either. This was on the 15th of March 1775.</P>
<P>On the 16th they came in &s;ight of land, but at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 17th, five &s;ail came in &s;ight, and one catching a breeze, bore down to hail them. They hoi&s;ted out the great cutter, and &s;ent an officer on board for news; who, upon his re|turn, brought the melancholy account of the boat's crew of the Adventure being killed and eaten by the cannibals of New Zealand. The &s;hip from which they received this intelligence was a Dutch Ea&s;t-Indiaman from Bengal, who upon being told that they had been in no European port &s;ince November 1772, offered them whatever they &s;tood in need of, either for repairs or refre&s;hments: but being in no immediate want, they very politely declined the obligation. This day was Friday with the Dutchman, but Saturday with our navigators, having gained a day by running to the ea&s;tward. The land they fir&s;t made proved Cape Legullas.</P>
<P>On the 18th they &s;poke with an Engli&s;h &s;hip, the Free Briton, Capt. Norton, from China. She had been fourteen or fifteen months out, and gave an account, which, however, was not true, that the Aurora's peo|ple had ri&s;en and killed the captain, officers, and &s;uperintendants, and that they had turned pirates, and had taken two Dutch &s;hips of
<PB N="327" REF="345">
con&s;iderable value; that &s;everal Indiamen had been lo&s;t, one in particular on the i&s;land of Johanna, part of who&s;e crew they had on board; and that two or three king's &s;hips that &s;ailed from India were on their return home.</P>
<P>In their pa&s;&s;age from Cape Legullas to Table-bay they met with &s;everal heavy gales, in which their ma&s;ts, &s;ails, and rigging, being much decayed, &s;uffered con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>On the 20th they came in &s;ight of Table-Land, on which day the captain was plea&s;ed to forgive the officers under arre&s;t, upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t they moored &s;hip in Table-bay, in &s;ight of many &s;hips of different nations, where they &s;oon heard the deplorable &s;tory of the Adventure's boats crew confirmed, with the addition of a fal&s;e report of the lo&s;s of a French &s;hip upon the &s;ame i&s;land, with the total de&s;tructin of the captain and crew, pro|pagated, no doubt, by the Adventure's people, to render an act of &s;avage barbarity that hard|ly would admit of aggravation &s;till more horrible.</P>
<P>Here they &s;taid till April the 27th to repair the &s;hip and recruit their &s;tores; and in the mean time the captain wrote letters to the Admiralty, with an account of their proceed|ings, and &s;afe arrival at the Cape, which were &s;ent home, together with the journals of the officers, by the Ceres Indiaman, who arrived in England on the third of July la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="346">At the Cape, the curio&s;ity of all nations was excited to learn the &s;ucce&s;s of their di&s;coveries, and in proportion to the earne&s;tne&s;s of the &s;ol|licitations, wherewith the common men were pre&s;&s;ed, by foreign inqui&s;itors, they took care to gratify them with wonderful relations. Hence many &s;trange &s;tories were circulated abroad, be|fore it was known at home, whether the &s;hip had peri&s;hed at &s;ea, or was upon her return to Europe.</P>
<P>The captain, however, lo&s;t no time in put|ting all things in a condition to complete the voyage; and the Dutton-Indiaman being in readine&s;s to put to &s;ea, they took their depar|ture together on the 27th of April, as has al|ready been &s;aid. On the 15th of May they arrived at St. Helena; on the 21&s;t they again proceeded in company, but parted at A&s;cen|&s;ion the 28th, the Re&s;olution having touched there, to take in turtle, while the Dutton con|tinued her cour&s;e. On the 11th of June they cro&s;&s;ed the line; on the 14th of July they an|chored at Fyal, one of the We&s;tern I&s;les; and on the 31&s;t of July 1775, arrived at Spithead; all in good health, having lo&s;t only one man by &s;ickne&s;s, and three by accidents, in all this long and hazardous voyage.</P>
