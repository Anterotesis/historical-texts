<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day Night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_I THINK my&s;elf obliged to thank you, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, for your conde&s;cen|&s;ion, in taking notice of a creature, who has occa&s;ioned you &s;o much &s;candal.</P>
<P>I am grieved on this account, as much, I verily think, as for the evil it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tell me&mdash;But yet I am afraid to know&mdash;what your mamma &s;aid.</P>
<P>I long, and yet I dread to be told, what the young ladies my companions, now never more, perhaps, to be &s;o, &s;ay of me.</P>
<P>They cannot, however, &s;ay wor&s;e of me than I will of my&s;elf. Self-accu&s;ation &s;hall flow in every line of my narrative, where I think I am ju&s;tly cen&s;urable.
<PB N="2" REF="3">
If any thing can ari&s;e from the account I am going to give you, for extenuation of my fault [For that is all a per&s;on can hope for, who cannot excu&s;e her&s;elf], I know I may expect it from your friend&s;hip, tho' not from the charity of any other: Since, by this time, I doubt not, every mouth is opened again&s;t me; and all that know Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, condemn the fugitive daughter.</P>
<P>AFTER I had depo&s;ited my letter to you, written down to the la&s;t hour, as I may &s;ay, I returned to the Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e; fir&s;t taking back my letter from the loo&s;e bricks: And there I endeavoured, as coolly as my &s;ituation would permit, to recollect, and lay to|gether, &s;everal incidents that had pa&s;&s;ed between my aunt and me; and, comparing them with &s;ome of the contents of my cou&s;in Dolly's letter, I began to hope, that I need not be &s;o very apprehen&s;ive, as I had been, of the next Wedne&s;day. And thus I argued with my&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Wedne&s;day cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the day they in|tend, altho', to intimidate me, they may wi&s;h me to think it is:&mdash;For the &s;ettlements are un&s;igned: Nor have they been offered me to &s;ign. I can choo&s;e whether I will, or will not, put my hand to them; hard as it will be to refu&s;e, if my father tender them to me.&mdash;Be&s;ides, Did not my father and mother propo&s;e, if I made compul&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary, to go to my uncle's them&s;elves, in order to be out of the way of my appeals? Whereas they intend to be pre&s;ent on Wed|ne&s;day. And, however affecting to me, the thought of meeting them, and all my friends, in full a&s;&s;em|bly, is, perhaps it is the very thing I ought to wi&s;h for: Since my brother and &s;i&s;ter had &s;uch an opinion of my intere&s;t in them, that they got me excluded from their pre&s;ence, as a mea&s;ure which they thought previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to carry on their de&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Nor have I rea&s;on to doubt, but that (as I had before argued with my&s;elf) I &s;hall be able to bring
<PB N="3" REF="4">
over &s;ome of my relations to my party; and, being brought face to face with my brother, that I &s;hall expo&s;e his malevolence, and, of con&s;equence, weaken his power.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Then, &s;uppo&s;ing the very wor&s;t, challenging the mini&s;ter, as I &s;hall challenge him, he will not pre|&s;ume to proceed: Nor, &s;urely, will Mr. Solmes dare to accept my refu&s;ing and &s;truggling hand. And, finally, if nothing el&s;e will do, nor procure me delay, I can plead &s;cruples of con&s;cience, and even pretend prior obligation; for, my dear, I have given Mr. Lovelace room to hope [as you will &s;ee in one of my letters in your hands], that I will be no other man's while he is &s;ingle, and gives me not wilful and premeditated cau&s;e of offence again&s;t him; and this in order to rein-in his re&s;entments on the declared animo&s;ity of my brother and uncles. And as I &s;hall appeal, or refer my &s;cruples on this head, to the good Dr. Lewin, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that my mamma and aunt (if nobody el&s;e) &s;hould be affected with this plea."</Q></P>
<P>Revolving cur&s;orily the&s;e things, I congratulated my&s;elf, that I had re&s;olved again&s;t going away with Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>I told you, my dear, that I would not &s;pare my&s;elf; and I enumerate the&s;e particulars, as an argument to condemn the action I have been &s;o unhappily betrayed into. An argument that concludes again&s;t me with the greater force, as I mu&s;t acknowlege, that I was apprehen&s;ive, that what my cou&s;in Dolly mentions as from Betty and from my &s;i&s;ter, was told <HI>her,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould tell <HI>me,</HI> in order to make me de&s;perate, and, perhaps, to pu&s;h me upon &s;ome &s;uch &s;tep as I have been drawn in to take, as the mo&s;t effectual means to ruin me with my father and uncles.</P>
<P>God forgive me, if I judge too hardly of their views!&mdash;But if I do <HI>not,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, that they laid a wicked &s;nare for me; and that I have been caught in
<PB N="4" REF="5">
it.&mdash;And doubly may they triumph, if they <HI>can</HI> tri|umph, in the ruin of a &s;i&s;ter, who never wi&s;hed or intended hurt to them!</P>
<P>As the above kind of rea&s;oning had le&s;&s;ened my apprehen&s;ions as to the Wedne&s;day, it added to tho&s;e I had of meeting him&mdash;Now, as it &s;eemed, not only the neare&s;t, but the heavie&s;t evil; principally, indeed, be|cau&s;e <HI>neare&s;t</HI>; for little did I dream [fooli&s;h creature that I was, and every way be&s;et!] of the event proving what it has proved. I expected a contention with him, 'tis true, as he had not my letter: But I thought it would be very &s;trange, as I mentioned in one of my former <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>ii.</HI> p. <HI>295.</HI></NOTE>, if I, who had &s;o &s;teadily held out again&s;t characters &s;o venerable, again&s;t authorities &s;o &s;acred, as I may &s;ay, when I thought them unrea&s;onably exerted, &s;hould not find my&s;elf more equal to &s;uch a trial as this; e&s;pecially, as I had &s;o much rea&s;on to be di&s;|plea&s;ed with him for not having taken away my letter.</P>
<P>On what a cri&s;is, on what a point of time, may one's fate depend! Had I had but two hours more to con&s;ider of the matter, and to attend to and improve upon the&s;e new lights, as I may call them&mdash;But then, perhaps, I might have given him a meeting.&mdash;Fool that I was, what had I to do, to give him hope, that I would <HI>per&s;onally</HI> acquaint him with the rea&s;on for my change of mind, if I did change it?</P>
<P>O my dear! an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper!&mdash;By endeavouring to gratify others, it is evermore di&s;obliging it&s;elf!</P>
<P>When the bell rang to call the &s;ervants to dinner, Betty came to me, and a&s;ked, If I had any commands before &s;he went to hers; repeating her hint, that &s;he &s;hould be <HI>employed</HI>; adding, that &s;he believed it was expected, that I &s;hould not come up till &s;he came down, or till I &s;aw my aunt or Mi&s;s Hervey.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her &s;ome que&s;tions about the ca&s;cade, which had been out of order, and lately mended; and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="6">
a curio&s;ity to &s;ee how it played, in order to in|duce her [How cunning to cheat my&s;elf, as it proved!] to go thither, if &s;he found me not where &s;he left me; it being at a part of the garden mo&s;t di&s;tant from the Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She could hardly have got into the hou&s;e, when I heard the fir&s;t &s;ignal&mdash;O how my heart fluttered!&mdash;But no time was to be lo&s;t. I &s;tept to the garden-door; and, &s;eeing a clear coa&s;t, unbolted the ready-unlocked door.&mdash;And there was he, all impatience, waiting for me!</P>
<P>A panic, next to fainting, &s;eized me, when I &s;aw him. My heart &s;eemed convul&s;ed; and I trembled &s;o, that I &s;hould hardly have kept my feet, had he not &s;upported me.</P>
<P>Fear nothing, deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he!&mdash;Let us ha&s;ten away!&mdash;The chariot is at hand!&mdash;And, by this &s;weet conde&s;cen&s;ion, you have obliged me beyond expre&s;&s;ion, or return!</P>
<P>Recovering my &s;pirits a little, as he kept drawing me after him, O Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I, I cannot go with you!&mdash;<HI>Indeed</HI> I cannot!&mdash;I wrote you word &s;o!&mdash;Let go my hand, and you &s;hall &s;ee my letter. It has lain there from ye&s;terday morning, till within this half-hour.&mdash;I bid you watch to the la&s;t for a letter from me, le&s;t I &s;hould be obliged to revoke the ap|pointment; and, had you followed the direction, you would have found it.</P>
<P>I have been watched, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid he, half out of breath!&mdash;I have been watched in every &s;tep I took: And my tru&s;ty &s;ervant has been watched too, ever &s;ince Saturday; and dared not to come near your wall.&mdash;And here we &s;hall be di&s;covered in a moment!&mdash;Speed away, my charmer!&mdash;This is the moment of your deliverance!&mdash;If you neglect this opportu|nity, you <HI>never</HI> can have &s;uch another!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">What is it you mean, Sir!&mdash;Let go my hand: For I tell you [&s;truggling vehemently], that I will &s;ooner die than go with you!&mdash;</P>
<P>Good God, &s;aid he! with a look of wildne&s;s and &s;urprize, what is it I hear!&mdash;But [&s;till drawing me after him, as he retreated farther from the door] it is no time to argue&mdash;By all that's good you mu&s;t go!&mdash;Surely you cannot doubt my honour, nor give me cau&s;e to que&s;tion your own.</P>
<P>As you value me, Mr. Lovelace, urge me no far|ther. I come fixed and re&s;olved. Let me give you the letter I had written. My further rea&s;ons &s;hall follow; and they will convince you, that I ought not to go.</P>
<P>Nothing, Madam, can convince me&mdash;By all that's &s;acred, I will not leave you! To leave you now, is to lo&s;e you for ever!</P>
<P>Am I to be thus compelled? interrupted I, with equal indignation and vehemence&mdash;Let go my hands&mdash;I am re&s;olved not to go with you&mdash;And I will con|vince you, that I <HI>ought</HI> not.</P>
<P>All my friends expect you, Madam!&mdash;All your own are determined again&s;t you!&mdash;Wedne&s;day next is the day! the important, perhaps the fatal day! Would you &s;tay to be Solmes's wife?&mdash;Can this be your determination at la&s;t?</P>
<P>No, never, never will I be that man's!&mdash;But I will not go with you!&mdash;Draw me not thus!&mdash;How dare you, Sir?&mdash;I would not have &s;een you, but to tell you &s;o!&mdash;I had not met you, but for fear you would have been guilty of &s;ome ra&s;hne&s;s!&mdash;And, once more, I will <HI>not</HI> go!&mdash;What mean you!&mdash;Striving with all my force to get from him.</P>
<P>What can have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my angel, quitting my hands, and with a gentler voice, that after &s;o much ill-u&s;age from your relations; vows &s;o &s;olemn on my part; an affection &s;o ardent; you &s;tab me with a re|fu&s;al to &s;tand by your own appointment!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">It &s;ignifies nothing talking, Mr. Lovelace. I will give you my rea&s;ons at a better opportunity. I can|not go with you now&mdash;And, once more, urge me no farther.&mdash;Surely I am not to be compelled by every body!</P>
<P>I &s;ee how it is, &s;aid he, with a dejected, but pa&s;&s;ion|ate air&mdash;What a &s;evere fate is mine!&mdash;At length your &s;pirit is &s;ubdued!&mdash;Your brother and &s;i&s;ter have prevailed; and I mu&s;t give up all my hopes to a wretch &s;o <HI>truly</HI> de&s;picable.&mdash;</P>
<P>Once more I tell you, interrupted I, I never will be his.&mdash;All may end on Wedne&s;day differently from what you expect.&mdash;</P>
<P>And it may <HI>not!</HI>&mdash;And then, good heaven!&mdash;</P>
<P>It is to be their la&s;t effort, as I have rea&s;on to be|lieve.&mdash;</P>
<P>And I have rea&s;on to believe &s;o too!&mdash;Since, if you tarry, you will inevitably be Solmes's wife.</P>
<P>Not &s;o, interrupted I.&mdash;I have obliged them in one point&mdash;They will be in good humour with me. I &s;hall gain time at lea&s;t&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hall&mdash;I have &s;e|veral ways to gain time.</P>
<P>And what, Madam, will gaining time do?&mdash;It is plain you have not a hope beyond that!&mdash;It is plain you have not, by putting all upon that precarious i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;O my deare&s;t, deare&s;t life! let me be&s;eech you not to run a ri&s;que of this con&s;equence. I can con|vince you, that it will be <HI>more</HI> than a ri&s;que, if you go back, that you will, on Wedne&s;day next, be Solmes's wife.&mdash;Prevent therefore, now that it is in your power to prevent, the fatal mi&s;chiefs that will follow &s;uch a dreadful certainty.</P>
<P>While I have any room for hope, it concerns <HI>your</HI> honour, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine [if you have the proper value for me, and wi&s;h me to believe you have], that my conduct in this great point &s;hall ju&s;tify my prudence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">Your prudence, Madam! When has that been que&s;tionable? Yet what &s;tead has either your pru|dence or your duty &s;tood you in, with people &s;o &s;trangely determined?</P>
<P>And then he pathetically enumerated the different in&s;tances of the har&s;h treatment I had met with; imputing all to the malice and caprice of a bro|ther, who &s;et every-body again&s;t him: And in&s;i&s;ting, that I had no other way to effect a reconciliation with my father and uncles, than by putting my&s;elf out of the power of my brother's inveterate malice.</P>
<P>Your brother's whole reliance, proceeded he, has been upon your ea&s;ine&s;s to bear his in&s;ults.&mdash;Your whole family will &s;eek to <HI>you,</HI> when you have freed your&s;elf from this di&s;graceful oppre&s;&s;ion:&mdash;When they know you are with tho&s;e who <HI>can,</HI> and <HI>will</HI> right you, they will give up to you your own e&s;tate.&mdash;Why then, putting his arm round me, and again drawing me with a gentle force after him, do you he&s;itate a moment?&mdash;Now is the time&mdash;Fly with me then, I be&s;eech you, my deare&s;t creature! Tru&s;t your per&s;ecuted adorer.&mdash;Have we not &s;uffered in the &s;ame cau&s;e? If any imputations are ca&s;t upon you, give me the honour, as I &s;hall be found to de|&s;erve it, to call you mine; and, when you are &s;o, &s;hall I not be able to protect both your per&s;on and cha|racter?</P>
<P>Urge me no more, Mr. Lovelace, I conjure you.&mdash;You your&s;elf have given me a hint, which I will &s;peak plainer to, than prudence, perhaps, on any other occa&s;ion, would allow me to &s;peak.&mdash;I am convinced, that Wedne&s;day next [if I had time, I would give you my rea&s;ons] is not intended to be the day we had both &s;o much dreaded: And if, after that day &s;hall be over, I find my friends to be determined in Mr. Solmes's favour, I will then contrive &s;ome way to meet you with Mi&s;s Howe, who is not your enemy: And when the
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;olemnity has pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall think that &s;tep a duty, which, <HI>till</HI> then, will be criminal to take: Since now my father's authority is unimpeached by any greater.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Mr. Lovelace, if you now di&s;pute!&mdash;If, after this more favourable declaration, than I had the thought of making, you are not &s;atisfied, I &s;hall know what to think both of your gratitude and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e, Madam, admits not of this alternative. I am all gratitude upon it. I cannot expre&s;s how much I &s;hould be delighted with the charming hope you have given me, were you not next Wedne&s;day, if you &s;tay, to be another man's. Think, deare&s;t creature! what an heightening of my angui&s;h the di&s;tant hope you bid me look up to, is, taken in this light!</P>
<P>Depend upon it, I will die &s;ooner than be Mr. Solmes's. If you would have me rely upon <HI>your</HI> ho|nour, why &s;hould you doubt of <HI>mine?</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not your <HI>honour,</HI> Madam; your <HI>power</HI> is all I doubt. You never, never can have &s;uch another opportunity.&mdash;Deare&s;t creature, permit me&mdash;And he was again drawing me after him.</P>
<P>Whither, Sir, do you draw me?&mdash;Leave me this moment&mdash;Do you &s;eek to keep me till my return &s;hall grow dangerous or impracticable?&mdash;I am not &s;atisfied with you at all! Indeed I am not!&mdash;This moment let me go, if you would have me think to|lerably of you.</P>
<P>My happine&s;s, Madam, both here and hereafter, and the &s;afety of all your implacable family, depend upon this moment.</P>
<P>To Providence, Mr. Lovelace, and to the Law, will I leave the &s;afety of my friends.&mdash;You &s;hall not threaten me into a ra&s;hne&s;s that my heart condemns!&mdash;Shall <HI>I,</HI> to promote your happine&s;s, as you call it, de&s;troy all my future peace of mind?</P>
<P>You trifle with me, my dear life, ju&s;t as our better pro&s;pects begin to open. The way is clear; ju&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="11">
now it is clear!&mdash;But you may be prevented in a moment.</P>
<P>What is it you doubt?&mdash;May I peri&s;h eternally, if your will &s;hall not be a law to me in every thing!&mdash;All my relations expect you: Your own appointment calls upon you!&mdash;Next WEDNESDAY&mdash;Deare&s;t creature!&mdash;think of next WEDNESDAY!&mdash;And what is it I urge you to, but to take a &s;tep that, &s;ooner than any other, will reconcile you to all you have mo&s;t rea&s;on to value in your family?</P>
<P>Let me judge for my&s;elf, Sir. Do not you, who blame my friends for endeavouring to compel me, <HI>your&s;elf</HI> &s;eek to compel me. I won't bear it.&mdash;Your earne&s;tne&s;s gives me greater apprehen&s;ions, and greater reluctance!&mdash;Let me go back, then!&mdash;Let me, be|fore it is too late, go back, that it may not be wor&s;e for both. What mean you by this forcible treatment?&mdash;Is it thus that I am to judge of the intire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to my will, which you have &s;o often vowed?&mdash;Un|hand me this moment, or I will cry out for help.</P>
<P>I will obey you, my deare&s;t creature!&mdash;And quitted my hand with a look full of tender de&s;pondency, that, knowing the violence of his temper, half-concerned me for him. Yet I was ha&s;tening from him, when, with a &s;olemn air, looking upon his &s;word, but catch|ing, as it were, his hand from it, he folded both his arms, as if a &s;udden thought had recovered him from an intended ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Stay, one moment!&mdash;But one moment &s;tay, O be&s;t beloved of my &s;oul!&mdash;Your retreat is &s;ecure, if you <HI>will</HI> go: The key lies down at the door.&mdash;But, O Madam, next WEDNESDAY, and you are Mr. Solmes's!&mdash;Fly me not &s;o eagerly!&mdash;Hear me but a few words.</P>
<P>When near the garden-door, I &s;topped; and was the more &s;atisfied, as I &s;aw the key there, by which I could let my&s;elf in again at plea&s;ure. But, being unea&s;y le&s;t I &s;hould be mi&s;&s;ed, I told him I could &s;tay
<PB N="11" REF="12">
no longer: I had already &s;tayed too long: That I would write to him all my rea&s;ons. And depend up|on it, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I, ju&s;t upon the point of &s;tooping for the key, in order to return, I will die, rather than have that man. You know what I have promi&s;ed, if I find my&s;elf in danger.</P>
<P>One word, Madam, however, one word more, approaching me, his arms &s;till folded, as if (as I thought) he would not be tempted to mi&s;chief.&mdash;Re|member only, that I come at your appointment, to redeem you, at the hazard of my life, from your gaolers and per&s;ecutors, with a re&s;olution, God is my witne&s;s, or may he for ever bla&s;t me! [That was his &s;hocking imprecation] to be a father, uncle, brother, and, as I humbly hoped, in your own good time, a <HI>hu&s;band</HI> to you, all in one. But &s;ince I find you are &s;o ready to cry out for <HI>help</HI> again&s;t me, which mu&s;t bring down upon me the vengeance of all your family, I am contented to run all ri&s;ques:&mdash;I will not a&s;k you to retreat with <HI>me</HI>; I will attend you into the garden, and into the <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> if I am not intercepted.&mdash;Nay, be not &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam! The help you would have called upon, I will attend you to.&mdash;I will face them all: But not as a revenger, if they provoke me not too much. You &s;hall &s;ee what I can further bear for your &s;ake. And let us both &s;ee, if expo&s;tulation, and the behaviour of a gentleman to them, will not pro|cure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them.</P>
<P>Had he offered to draw his &s;word upon him&s;elf, I was prepared to have de&s;pi&s;ed him for &s;uppo&s;ing me &s;uch a poor novice, as to be intimidated by an artifice &s;o common. But this re&s;olution, uttered with &s;o &s;erious an air, of accompanying me in to my friends, made me ga&s;p almo&s;t with terror.</P>
<P>What mean you, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I?&mdash;I be|&s;eech you leave me; Leave me, Sir, I be&s;eech you.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Madam! I beg you to excu&s;e me!&mdash;I have long enough &s;kulked like a thief about the&s;e lonely
<PB N="12" REF="13">
walls!&mdash;Long, too long, have I borne the in&s;ults of your brother, and others of your relations. Ab&s;ence but heightens malice. I am de&s;perate. I have but this one chance for it; for is not the day after to|morrow WEDNESDAY? I have encouraged viru|lence by my tamene&s;s?&mdash;Yet <HI>tame</HI> I will &s;till be!&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee, Madam, what I will bear for your &s;ake. My &s;word &s;hall be put &s;heathed into your hands [And he offered it to me in the &s;cabbard]:&mdash;My heart, if you plea&s;e, &s;hall afford a &s;heath to theirs:&mdash;Life is nothing, if I lo&s;e you.&mdash;Be plea&s;ed, Madam, to &s;hew me the way into the garden. I will attend you, tho' to my fate! But too happy, be it what it will, if I receive it in your pre&s;ence. Lead on, dear creature!&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee what I can bear for you.&mdash;And he &s;tooped, and took up the key; and offered it to the lock&mdash;But dropped it again, without opening the door, upon my earne&s;t expo&s;tulation to him.</P>
<P>What can you mean, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I?&mdash;Would you thus expo&s;e your&s;elf?&mdash;Would you thus expo&s;e me?&mdash;Is this your genero&s;ity?&mdash;Is every-body to take advantage thus of the weakne&s;s of my temper?</P>
<P>And I wept. I could not help it.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf upon his knees at my feet.&mdash;Who can bear, &s;aid he, with an ardour that could not be feigned, his own eyes gli&s;tening, as I thought, Who can bear, to behold &s;uch &s;weet emotion?&mdash;O charmer of my heart, and re&s;pectfully &s;till kneeling, he took my hand with both his, pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, command me <HI>with</HI> you, command me <HI>from</HI> you; in every way I am all implicit obedience!&mdash;But I appeal to all you know of your relations cruelty to you, and of their determined malice again&s;t me, and as determined fa|vour to the man you tell me you hate&mdash;And, oh! Madam, if you did not hate him, I &s;hould hardly think there would be a merit in your approbation, place it where you would&mdash;I appeal to every-thing you know, to all you have &s;uffered, whether you have
<PB N="13" REF="14">
not rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of <HI>that</HI> Wedne&s;day, which is my terror!&mdash;Whether you can po&s;&s;ibly have &s;uch another opportunity.&mdash;The chariot ready: My friends with impatience expecting the re&s;ult of <HI>your own</HI> appointment: A man who&s;e will &s;hall be intirely your will, imploring you, thus on his knees imploring you&mdash;to be <HI>your own Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>; that is all: Nor will I a&s;k for your favour, but as upon full proof I &s;hall appear to de&s;erve it: Fortune, alliances unobjectible!&mdash;O my beloved creature, pre&s;&s;ing my hand once more to his lips, let not &s;uch an opportunity &s;lip! You never, never, will have &s;uch another!</P>
<P>I bid him ri&s;e: He 'ro&s;e; and I told him, that were I not thus unaccountably hurried by his impatience, I doubted not to convince him, that both he and I had looked upon next Wedne&s;day with greater appre|hen&s;ion than was nece&s;&s;ary: And was proceeding to give him my rea&s;ons; but he broke in upon me&mdash;</P>
<P>Had I, Madam, but the &s;hadow of a probability to hope what <HI>you</HI> hope, I would be all obedience and re&s;ignation. But the licence is actually got: The par&s;on is provided: That pedant Brand is the man: O my deare&s;t creature, do the&s;e preparations mean only a trial?</P>
<P>You know not, Sir, were the wor&s;t to be intended, and weak as you think me, what a &s;pirit I have; you know not what I can do, and how I can re&s;i&s;t, when I think my&s;elf meanly or unrea&s;onably dealt with: Nor do you know what I have already &s;uffered, what I have already borne, knowing to who&s;e unbrotherly in&s;tigations all is to be a&s;cribed.&mdash;</P>
<P>I may expect all things, Madam, interrupted he, from the noblene&s;s of your mind, &s;corning unrea&s;on|able compul&s;ion: But your &s;pirits may fail you. From the invincible temper of a father &s;o po&s;itive, to a daughter &s;o dutiful, what may not be apprehended? Fainting will not &s;ave you: They will not, perhaps, be &s;orry for &s;uch an effect of their barbarity. What

will expo&s;tulations &s;ignify again&s;t a ceremony per|formed? Mu&s;t not All, the dreadful All, follow, that is torture to my heart but to think of?&mdash;Nobody to appeal to, of what avail will your re&s;i&s;tance be again&s;t the con&s;equences of a rite witne&s;&s;ed to by the impo&s;ers of it; and tho&s;e your neare&s;t relations?</P>
<P>I was &s;ure, I &s;aid, of procuring a delay at lea&s;t. Many ways I had to procure delay.&mdash;Nothing could be &s;o fatal to us both, as for me now to be found with him.&mdash;My apprehen&s;ions on this &s;core, I told him, grew too &s;trong for my heart.&mdash;I &s;hould think very hardly of him, if he &s;ought to detain me longer. But his acquie&s;cence &s;hould engage my gratitude.</P>
<P>And then &s;tooping to take up the key to let my&s;elf into the garden, he &s;tarted, and looked as if he had heard &s;omebody near the door, on the in&s;ide, clap|ping his hand on his &s;word.</P>
<P>This frighted me &s;o, that I thought I &s;hould have &s;unk down at his feet. But he in&s;tantly re-a&s;&s;ured me: He thought, he &s;aid, he had heard a ru&s;tling again&s;t the door: But <HI>had</HI> it been &s;o, the noi&s;e would have been &s;tronger. It was only the effect of his ap|prehen&s;ion for my mind's &s;ake.</P>
<P>And then taking up the key, he pre&s;ented it to me.&mdash;If you <HI>will</HI> go, Madam&mdash;Yet I cannot, cannot leave you!&mdash;I mu&s;t enter the garden with you&mdash;Forgive me, but I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> enter the garden with you.</P>
<P>And will you, will you, thus ungenerou&s;ly, Sir, take advantage of my fears!&mdash;of my wi&s;hes, to prevent mi&s;chief?&mdash;I, vain fool, to be concerned for every|one; nobody for me!</P>
<P>Deare&s;t creature! interrupted he, holding my hand, as I tremblingly offered to put the key to the lock&mdash;Let <HI>me,</HI> if you <HI>will</HI> go, open the door.&mdash;But once more, con&s;ider, &s;hould you prevail for that delay, which &s;eems to be your only dependence, whether you may not be clo&s;er confined? I know they have already had <HI>that</HI> in con&s;ideration. Will you not, in

this ca&s;e, be prevented from corre&s;ponding either with Mi&s;s Howe, or with me?&mdash;Who then &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your e&s;cape, if e&s;cape you would?&mdash;From your chamber-window only permitted to view the garden you mu&s;t not enter into, how will you wi&s;h for the opportunity you now have, if your hatred to Solmes continue?&mdash;But, alas! that cannot continue!&mdash;If you go back, it mu&s;t be from the impul&s;es of a yield|ing (which you'll call, a dutiful) heart, tired and teazed out of your own will.</P>
<P>I have no patience, Sir, to be thus re&s;trained!&mdash;Mu&s;t I never be at liberty to follow my own judg|ment?&mdash;Be the con&s;equence what it may, I will not be thus con&s;trained.&mdash;And then freeing my hand, I again offered the key to the door.</P>
<P>Down the ready kneeler dropt between me and that: And can you, can you, Madam, once more on my knees let me a&s;k you, look with an indifferent eye upon the evils that may follow? Provoked as I have been, and triumphed over as I &s;hall be, if your brother &s;ucceeds, my own heart &s;hudders, at times, at the thoughts of what <HI>mu&s;t</HI> happen: And can <HI>yours</HI> be unconcerned! Let me be&s;eech you, deare&s;t crea|ture! to con&s;ider all the&s;e things; and lo&s;e not this only opportunity.&mdash;My intelligence&mdash;</P>
<P>Never, Mr. Lovelace, interrupted I, pin &s;o much faith upon the &s;leeve of a traitor.&mdash;Your ba&s;e intelli|gencer is but a &s;ervant: He may pretend to know more than he has grounds for, in order to earn the wages of corruption. You know not what contrive|ances I can find out.</P>
<P>I was offering the key to the lock, when, &s;tarting from his knees, with a voice of affrightment, loudly whi&s;pering, and as if out of breath, <HI>They are at the door, my beloved creature!</HI> And taking the key from me, he flew to it, and fluttered with it, as if he would double-lock it. And in&s;tantly a voice from within cried out, bur&s;ting again&s;t the door, as if to break it
<PB N="16" REF="17">
open, and, repeating its violent pu&s;hes, <HI>Are you there?&mdash;Come up this moment!&mdash;This moment!&mdash;Here they are&mdash;Here they are both together!&mdash;Your pi&s;tol this moment!&mdash;Your gun!</HI>&mdash;Then another pu&s;h, and another.&mdash;He at the &s;ame moment drew his &s;word, and clapping it naked under his arm, took both my trembling hands in his; and, drawing me &s;wiftly after him, Fly, fly, my charmer; this moment is all you have for it! &s;aid he.&mdash;Your brother!&mdash;Your uncles! or this Solmes!&mdash;They will in&s;tantly bur&s;t the door!&mdash;Fly, my deare&s;t life! if you would not be more cruelly u&s;ed than ever!&mdash;If you would not &s;ee two or three murders committed at your feet, fly, fly, I be|&s;eech you!</P>
<P>O Lord!&mdash;Help, help, cried the fool, all amaze and confu&s;ion, frighted beyond the power of con|trouling.</P>
<P>Now behind me, now before me, now on this &s;ide, now on that, turned I my affrighted face, in the &s;ame moment; expecting a furious brother here, armed &s;ervants there, an inraged &s;i&s;ter &s;creaming, and a father armed with terror in his countenance, more dreadful than even the drawn &s;word which I &s;aw, or tho&s;e I apprehended. I ran as fa&s;t as he, yet knew not that I ran; my fears, which at the &s;ame time that they took all power of thinking from me, adding wings to my feet: My fears, which probably would not have &s;uffered me to know what cour&s;e to take, had I not had him to urge and draw me after him: E&s;pecially as I beheld a man, who mu&s;t have come out of the garden-door, keeping us in his eye, running backward and forward, beckoning and calling out to others, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>he</HI> &s;aw, although the turn|ing of the wall hindered <HI>me</HI> from &s;eeing them; and whom I imagined to be my brother, my father, and their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Thus terrified, I was got out of &s;ight of the door in a very few minutes: And then, altho' quite breath|le&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="18">
between running and apprehen&s;ion, he put my arm under his, his drawn &s;word in the other hand, and hurried me on &s;till fa&s;ter: My voice, however, contradicting my action; crying, No, no, no, all the while, &s;training my neck to look back, as long as the walls of the garden and park were within &s;ight, and till he brought me to his uncle's chariot: Where attending were two armed &s;ervants of his own, and two of Lord M.'s, on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend my relation for a while: For now I am come to this &s;ad period of it, my indi&s;cre|tion &s;tares me in the face: And my &s;hame and my grief give me a compunction, that is more poignant, methinks, than if I had a dagger in my heart&mdash;To have it to reflect, that I &s;hould &s;o incon&s;iderately give in to an interview, which, had I known either my&s;elf or him, or in the lea&s;t con&s;idered the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, I might have &s;uppo&s;ed, would put me into the power of his re&s;olution, and out of that of my own rea&s;on.</P>
<P>For, might I not have believed, that <HI>he,</HI> who thought he had cau&s;e to apprehend, that he was on the point of lo&s;ing a per&s;on who had co&s;t him &s;o much pains and trouble, would not hinder her, if po&s;&s;ible, from returning? That he, who knew I had promi&s;ed to give him up for ever, if in&s;i&s;ted on, as a condition of reconciliation, would not endeavour to put it out of my power to do &s;o?&mdash;In &s;hort, that he, who had artfully forborn to &s;end for my letter [for he could not be watched, my dear], le&s;t he &s;hould find in it a countermand to my appointment (as I my&s;elf could apprehend, altho' I profited not by the apprehen&s;ion), would want a device to keep me with him till the danger of having our meeting di&s;covered, might throw me ab&s;olutely into his power, to avoid my own wor&s;e u&s;age, and the mi&s;chiefs which might have en&s;ued, perhaps in my very &s;ight, had my friends and he met?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">But if it &s;hall come out, that the per&s;on within the garden was his corrupted implement, employed to frighten me away with him, do you think, my dear, that I &s;hall not have rea&s;on to hate him and my&s;elf &s;till more?&mdash;I hope his heart cannot be &s;o deep and &s;o vile a one: I hope not: But how came it to pa&s;s; that one man could get out at the garden-door, and no more? How, that that man kept aloof, as it were, and pur&s;ued us not; nor run back to alarm the hou&s;e?&mdash;My fright, and my di&s;tance, would not let me be certain; but really this &s;ingle man had the air of that vile Jo&s;eph Leman, as I recollect.</P>
<P>O why, why, my dear friends!&mdash;But wherefore blame I them, when I had argued my&s;elf into a hope, not improbable, that even the dreadful trial I was to undergo &s;o &s;oon, might turn out better, than if I had been directly carried away from the pre&s;ence of my once indulgent parents, who might po&s;&s;ibly intend that trial to be the la&s;t I &s;hould have had?</P>
<P>Would to heaven, that I had &s;tood it however!&mdash;Then, if I had afterwards done, what now I have been prevailed upon, or perhaps fooli&s;hly frightened to do, I &s;hould not have been &s;tung &s;o much by in|ward reproach, as now I am: And this would have been a great evil avoided!</P>
<P>You know, my dear, that your Clari&s;&s;a's mind was ever above ju&s;tifying her own failings by tho&s;e of others. God forgive tho&s;e of my friends who have acted cruelly by me! But their faults <HI>are</HI> their own and not excu&s;es for mine. And mine began early. For I ought not to have corre&s;ponded with him.</P>
<P>O the vile incroacher! how my indignation, at times, ri&s;es at him! Thus to lead a young creature (too much indeed relying upon her own &s;trength) from evil to evil!&mdash;This la&s;t evil, altho' the remote, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ure con&s;equence of my fir&s;t&mdash;my prohibited corre+&s;pondence! By a father, at lea&s;t, early prohibited!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">How much more properly had I acted, with regard to that corre&s;pondence, had I, once for all, when he was forbid to vi&s;it me, and I to receive his vi&s;its, pleaded the authority I ought to have been bound by, and denied to write to him!&mdash;But I thought I could proceed or &s;top as I plea&s;ed.

<P>As to this la&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s; now, that it is too late, I plainly &s;ee how I ought to have conducted my&s;elf.&mdash;As he knew I had but one way of tran&s;mitting to him the knowlege of what befel me; as he knew, that my fate was upon a cri&s;is with my friends; and that I had, in my letter to him, re&s;erved the liberty of re|voking; I &s;hould not have been &s;olicitous whether he had got my letter or not: When he had come, and found I did not an&s;wer his &s;ignal, he would pre&s;ently have re&s;orted to the loo&s;e bricks, and there been &s;a|tisfied by the date of my letter, that it was his own fault, that he had it not before. But, governed by the &s;ame pragmatical motives, which induced me to corre&s;pond with him at fir&s;t, I was again afraid, truly, with my fooli&s;h and bu&s;y pre&s;cience [and indeed he pretends now, that I had rea&s;on for it, as you &s;hall hear in its place; but which then I could only fear, and not be &s;ure of], that the di&s;appointment would have thrown him into the way of receiving fre&s;h in|&s;ults from the &s;ame per&s;ons; which might have made him guilty of &s;ome violence to them. And &s;o, to &s;ave him an <HI>apprehended</HI> ra&s;hne&s;s, I have ru&s;hed into a <HI>real</HI> one my&s;elf. And what vexes me more, is, that it is plain to me now, by all his behaviour, that he had as great a confidence in my weakne&s;s, as I had in my own &s;trength. And &s;o, in a point intirely relative to my honour, he has triumphed [Can I have patience to
<PB N="20" REF="21">
look at him!]; for he has not been mi&s;taken in me, while I have in my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Tell me, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, tell me truly, if your unforced heart does not de&s;pi&s;e me?&mdash;It mu&s;t! for your mind and mine were ever <HI>one</HI>; and I de|&s;pi&s;e <HI>my&s;elf!</HI>&mdash;And well I may: For could the giddie&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;iderate girl in <HI>England</HI> have done wor&s;e than I &s;hall have appear to have done in the eye of the world? Since my crime will be known without the provocations, and without the artifices of the betrayer too [Indeed, my dear, he is a very artful man]; while it will be a high aggravation, that better things were expected from me, than from many others.</P>
<P>You charge me to marry the fir&s;t opportunity.&mdash;Ah! my dear! <HI>another</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed effects of my folly!&mdash;That's as much in my power now as&mdash;as I am my&s;elf!&mdash;For can I give a &s;anction immediately to his deluding arts?&mdash;Can I <HI>avoid</HI> being angry with him for tricking me thus, as I may &s;ay [and as I have called it to him], out of my&s;elf?&mdash;For compelling me to take a &s;tep &s;o contrary to all my re&s;olutions, and a&s;&s;urances given to you; &s;o dreadfully inconve|nient to my&s;elf; &s;o di&s;graceful and &s;o grievous, as it mu&s;t be, to my dear mamma, were I to be le&s;s regardful of any other!&mdash;You don't know, nor can you ima|gine, my dear, how I am mortified!&mdash;How much I am &s;unk in my own opinion!&mdash;I, that was propo&s;ed for an example, truly, to others!&mdash;O that I were again in my father's hou&s;e, &s;tealing down with a letter to you; my heart beating with expectation of finding one from you!</P>
<P>THIS is the Wedne&s;day-morning I dreaded &s;o much, that I once thought of it as my doom&s;day: But of the Monday, it is plain, I ought to have been mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive. Had I &s;tayed, and had the wor&s;t I dreaded happened, my friends would then have been

an&s;werable, if any bad con&s;equences had followed:&mdash;But, now, I have this <HI>one</HI> con&s;olation left me [a very &s;ad one, you'll &s;ay], that I have cleared <HI>them</HI> of blame, and taken it all upon <HI>my&s;elf!</HI></P>
<P>You will not wonder to &s;ee this narrative &s;o di&s;|mally &s;crawled. It is owing to different pens and ink, all bad, and written by &s;natches of time, my hand trembling too with fatigue and grief.</P>
<P>I will not add to the length of it, by the particu|lars of his behaviour to me, and of our conver&s;ation at St. Albans, and &s;ince; becau&s;e tho&s;e will come in cour&s;e, in the continuation of my &s;tory; which, no doubt, you will expect from me.</P>
<P>Only thus much I will &s;ay, that he is extremely re|&s;pectful, even ob&s;equiou&s;ly &s;o, at pre&s;ent, tho' I am &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfied with him, and my&s;elf, that he has hitherto had no great cau&s;e to prai&s;e my complai&s;ance to him. Indeed, I can hardly, at times, bear the &s;educer in my &s;ight.</P>
<P>The lodgings I am in, are inconvenient. I &s;hall not &s;tay in them: So it &s;ignifies nothing to tell you how to direct to me hither. And where my next may be, as yet I know not.</P>
<P>He knows that I am writing to you; and has offered to &s;end my letter, when fini&s;hed, by a &s;ervant of his. But I thought I could not be too cautious, as I am now &s;ituated, in having a letter of this importance conveyed to you. Who knows what &s;uch a man may do? So very wicked a contriver!

<P>AT length your beloved young Lady has con&s;ented to free her&s;elf from the cruel treatment &s;he has &s;o long borne. She is to meet me without the garden-door, at about four o'clock on Monday afternoon; as I told you &s;he had promi&s;ed. She has confirmed her promi&s;e. Thank God, &s;he has confirmed her promi&s;e!</P>
<P>I &s;hall have a chariot-and-&s;ix ready in the by-road fronting the private path to Harlowe-paddock; and &s;everal of my friends and &s;ervants not far off, armed to protect her, if there be occa&s;ion: But every one charged to avoid mi&s;chief. That, you know, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> always been my principal care.</P>
<P>All my fear is, that when &s;he comes to the point the over-nicene&s;s of her principles will make her waver and want to go back: Altho' <HI>her</HI> honour is <HI>my</HI> honour you know, and <HI>mine</HI> is <HI>hers.</HI> If &s;he &s;hould, and I &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be unable to prevail upon her, all your pa&s;t &s;ervice will avail nothing, and &s;he will be lo&s;t to me for ever The prey, then, of that cur&s;ed Solmes, who&s;e vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tingine&s;s will never permit him to do good to any the &s;ervants of the family.</P>

your, a&s;&s;i&s;tance may crown the work: For, if &s;he wavers, a little innocent contrivance will be nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Be very mindful, therefore, of the following di|rections: Take them into your heart. This will pro|bably be your la&s;t trouble, until my beloved and I are joined in holy wedlock: And then we will be &s;ure to take care of you. You know what I have, promi&s;ed.

<P>Contrive to be in the garden in di&s;gui&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, and un&s;een by your young Lady. If you find the garden-door unbolted, you'll know, that &s;he and I are together, altho' you &s;hould not &s;ee her go out at it. It will be locked, but my key &s;hall be on the ground, at the bottom of the door, without, that you may open it with yours, as it may be needful.</P>
<P>If you hear our voices parleying, keep at the door, till I cry Hem, hem, twice: But be watchful for this &s;ignal, for I mu&s;t not hem very loud, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould take it for a &s;ignal: Perhaps, in &s;truggling to prevail upon the dear creature, I may have an opportunity to &s;trike the door hard with my elbow, or heel, to con|firm you:&mdash;Then you are to make a violent bur&s;t again&s;t the door, as if you'd break it open, drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry: Then, with another pu&s;h, but with more noi&s;e than &s;trength, le&s;t the lock give way, cry out (as if you &s;aw &s;ome of the family), Come up, come up, in&s;tantly!&mdash;Here they are! Here they are! Ha&s;ten!&mdash;This in&s;tant ha&s;ten! And mention &s;words, pi&s;tols, guns, with as terrible a voice, as you can cry out with. Then &s;hall I prevail upon her, no doubt, if loth before, to fly: If I can|not, I will enter the garden with her, and the hou&s;e too, be the con&s;equence what it will. But &s;o 'frighted, there is no que&s;tion but &s;he will fly.</P>
<P>When you think us at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance [and I &s;hall rai&s;e my voice, urging her &s;wifter flight, that

<P>When you have opened the door, take your key out of the lock, and put it in your pocket: Then, &s;tooping for mine, put it in the lock on the <HI>in&s;ide,</HI> that it may appear as if the door was opened by her|&s;elf, with a key they'll &s;uppo&s;e of my procuring (it being new), and left open by us.</P>
<P>They &s;hould conclude &s;he is gone off by her own con&s;ent, that they may not pur&s;ue us: That they may &s;ee no hopes of tempting her back again. In either ca&s;e, mi&s;chief might happen, you know.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t take notice, that you are only to open the door with your key, in ca&s;e none of the fa|mily come up to interrupt us, and before we are quite gone; For, if they do, you'll find by what follows, that you mu&s;t not open the door at all.

<P>If they do not come to interrupt us, and if you, by help of your key, come out, follow us at a di|&s;tance, and, with uplifted hands, and wild and im|patient ge&s;tures (running backward and forward, for fear you &s;hould come too near us; and as if you &s;aw &s;omebody coming to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance), cry out for Help, help, and to ha&s;ten.

But, this la&s;t command!&mdash;It &s;eems &s;o intricket!&mdash;Lord be merciful to me, how have I been led from littel &s;tepps to grate &s;tepps!&mdash;And iff I &s;hould be found out!&mdash;But your Hon|ner &s;ays, you will take me into your Honner's &s;ar|vi&s;e, and protect me, if as I &s;hould at any time be found out; and rai&s;e my wages be&s;ides; or &s;et me upp in a good inne; which is my ambi&s;hion. And you will be honnerable, and kind to my deare&s;t young Lady, God love her.&mdash;But who can be un|kind to &s;he?</P>
<P>I will do the be&s;t I am able, &s;ince your Honner will be apt to lo&s;e her, as your Honner &s;ays, if I do not; and a man &s;o &s;tindgie will be apt to gain her. But mayhap my deare&s;t younge Lady will not make all this troubble needful. If &s;he has promi&s;&s;ed, &s;he will &s;tand to it, I dare to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I love your Honner for contriveing to &s;ave mi&s;chiff &s;o well. I thought till I know'd your Honner, that you was verry mi&s;chevous, and ple&s;e your Honner. But find it to be quite another thing. Your Honner, it is plane, means mighty well by every body, as far as I &s;ee. As I am &s;ure I do my&s;elf; for I am, althoff a very plane Man, and all that, a very honne&s;t one, I thank my God. And have good principles, and have kept my young Lady's pre&s;&s;epts always in mind: For &s;he goes no-where, but &s;aves a &s;oul or two, more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>So, commending my&s;elf to your Honner's fur|thir favour, not forgetting the inne, when your Hon|ner

<P>I Snatch a few moments, while my Beloved is retired (as I hope, to re&s;t), to perform my pro|mi&s;e. No pur&s;uit!&mdash;Nor have I apprehen&s;ions of any; tho' I mu&s;t make my charmer dread that there will be one.</P>
<P>And now, let me tell thee, that never was joy &s;o complete as mine!&mdash;But let me inquire! Is not the angel flown away?&mdash;</P>
<P>O no! She is in the next apartment!&mdash;Securely mine!&mdash;Mine for ever!</P>
<Q><L>O ec&s;ta&s;y!&mdash;My heart will bur&s;t my brea&s;t,</L>
<L>To leap into her bo&s;om!&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>I knew, that the whole &s;tupid family were in a combination to do my bu&s;ine&s;s for me. I told thee, that they were all working for me, like &s;o many un|derground moles; and &s;till more blind than the moles are &s;aid to be, unknowing that they did &s;o. I my&s;elf, the director of their principal motions; which falling in with the malice of their little hearts, they took to be all their own.</P>
<P>But did I &s;ay, my joy was perfect?&mdash;O no!&mdash;It receives &s;ome abatement from my di&s;gu&s;ted pride. For how can I endure to think, that I owe more to her relation's per&s;ecutions, than to her favour for me?&mdash;Or even, as far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?</P>
<P>But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do &s;o, It might co&s;t my charmer dear.&mdash;Let me rejoice,

that &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon: That &s;he cannot return: That, as I have ordered it, the flight will appear to the Implacables to be altogether with her own con&s;ent; And that, if I doubt her love, I can put her to tryals, as mortifying to her nicene&s;s, as glorious to my pride.&mdash;For, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if I thought there was but the &s;hadow of a doubt in her mind, whether &s;he preferr'd me to any man living, I would &s;hew her no mercy.</P>

<P>BUT, on the wings of love, I fly to my charmer, who, perhaps, by this time, is ri&s;ing, to encourage the tardy dawn. I have not &s;lept a wink of the hour and half I lay down to invite &s;leep. It &s;eems to me, that I am not &s;o much Body, as to require &s;uch vulgar renovation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, April 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL pur&s;ue my melancholy &s;tory.</P>
<P>Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpo&s;e to have refu&s;ed entering into it, had he not, in my fright, lifted me in, as he did: And it in&s;tantly drove away a full gallop, and &s;topt not till it brought us to St. Albans; which was ju&s;t as the day &s;hut in.</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould have fainted &s;everal times by the way. With lifted-up hands and eyes, God protect me, &s;aid I often to my&s;elf!&mdash;Can it be I, that am here!&mdash;My eyes running over, and my heart ready to bur&s;t with &s;ighs as involuntary as my flight.</P>
<P>How different, how inexpre&s;&s;ibly different, the gay wretch; vi&s;ibly triumphing (as I could not but con|&s;true his almo&s;t rapturous joy) in the &s;ucce&s;s of his arts! But overflowing with complimental flouri&s;hes, yet re&s;pectfully di&s;tant his addre&s;s, all the way we <HI>flew</HI>; for that, rather than <HI>galloping,</HI> was the motion of the hor&s;es; which took, as I believe, a round-about way, to prevent being traced.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to think, there were other hor&s;emen at his devotion; three or four different per&s;ons, above the rank of &s;ervants, galloping by us, now-and-then, on each &s;ide of the chariot: But he took no notice of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with in|dignation, notwith&s;tanding all his blandi&s;hments, to a&s;k any que&s;tions about them, or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Think, my dear, what were my thoughts, on alighting from the chariot; having no attendant of my own &s;ex; no cloaths but what I had on, and tho&s;e little &s;uited for &s;uch a journey as I had <HI>already</HI> taken, and was &s;till <HI>further</HI> to take: Neither hood nor hat,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
nor any thing but a handkerchief about my neck and &s;houlders: Fatigued to death: My mind &s;till more fatigued than my body: And in &s;uch a foam the hor&s;es, that every one in the inn we put up at gue&s;s'd (they could not do otherwi&s;e) that I was a young giddy creature, who had run away from her friends. This it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, by their whi&s;pering and gaping; more of the people of the hou&s;e al&s;o coming in to view us, as it were, by turns, than was nece&s;&s;ary for the attendance.</P>
<P>The gentlewoman of the inn, whom he &s;ent in to me, &s;hewed me another apartment; and, &s;eeing me ready to faint, brought me hart&s;horn and water; and then, upon my de&s;iring to be left alone for half an hour, retired: For I found my heart ready to bur&s;t, on revolving every thing in my thoughts; And the moment &s;he was gone, fa&s;tening the door, I threw my&s;elf into an old great chair, and gave way to a vio|lent flood of tears; which a little relieved me.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, &s;ooner than I wi&s;hed, &s;ent up the gentlewoman, who pre&s;&s;ed me, in his name, to admit my Brother, or to come down to him: For he had told her, I was his Si&s;ter; and that he had brought me, again&s;t my will, and without warning, from a friend's hou&s;e, where I had been all the winter, in order to prevent my marrying again&s;t the con&s;ent of my friends; to whom he was now conducting me; and that, having given me no time for a travelling-dre&s;s, I was greatly offended at him.</P>
<P>So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which, indeed, &s;uited me the better, becau&s;e I was unable, for &s;ome time, to talk, &s;peak, or look up; and &s;o my dejection, and grief, and &s;ilence, might very well pa&s;s before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me, as a fit of &s;ullenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The room I was in being a bed-chamber, I cho&s;e to go down, at his repeated me&s;&s;age, attended by
<PB N="33" REF="34">
the gentlewoman of the inn, to that in which he was. He approached me with great re&s;pect, yet not exceed|ing a brotherly politene&s;s, where a brother <HI>is</HI> polite; and, calling me his deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, a&s;ked after the &s;tate of my mind; and hoped I would forgive him; for never brother half &s;o well loved a &s;i&s;ter, as he me.</P>
<P>A wretch!&mdash;How naturally did he fall into the character, altho' I was &s;o much out of mine!</P>
<P>Unthinking creatures have &s;ome comfort in the &s;hortne&s;s of their views; in their unapprehen&s;ivene&s;s; and that they penetrate not beyond the pre&s;ent mo|ment: In &s;hort, that they <HI>are</HI> unthinking!&mdash;But, for a per&s;on of my thoughtful di&s;po&s;ition, who has been accu&s;tomed to look forward, as well to the <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> as to the <HI>probable,</HI> what comfort can I have in my re|flections?</P>
<P>But let me give you the particulars of our conver&s;a|tion, a little before and after our &s;upper-time, joining both in one.</P>
<P>When we were alone, he be&s;ought me [I cannot &s;ay but with all the tokens of a pa&s;&s;ionate and re|&s;pectful tenderne&s;s] to be better reconciled to my&s;elf, and to him: He repeated all the vows of honour, and inviolable affection, that he ever made me: He pro|mi&s;ed to be wholly governed by me in every future &s;tep: He a&s;ked me to give him leave to propo&s;e, Whe|ther I cho&s;e to &s;et out next day to either of his aunts?</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent. I knew not what to &s;ay, nor what to do.</P>
<P>Whether I cho&s;e to have private lodgings procured me, in either of tho&s;e ladies neighbourhood, as were once my thoughts?</P>
<P>I was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Whether I cho&s;e to go to either of Lord M.'s &s;eats; that of Berks, or that in the county we were in?</P>
<P>In lodgings, I &s;aid, any-where, where he was not to be.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">He had promi&s;ed This, he own'd; and he would religiou&s;ly keep to his word, as &s;oon as he found all danger of pur&s;uit over; and that I was &s;ettled to my mind.&mdash;But, if the place were indifferent to me, Lon|don was the &s;afe&s;t, and the mo&s;t private: And his relations &s;hould all vi&s;it me there, the moment I thought fit to admit them. His cou&s;in Charlotte, particularly, &s;hould attend me, as my companion, if I would accept of her, as &s;oon as &s;he was able to go abroad.&mdash;Mean time, would I go to his aunt Law|rance's (his aunt Sadleir was a melancholy woman)? I &s;hould be the mo&s;t welcome gue&s;t &s;he ever received.</P>
<P>I told him, I wi&s;hed not to go (immediately, how|ever, and in the frame I was in, and likely not to be out of) to any of his relations: That my reputation was concerned, to have <HI>him</HI> ab&s;ent from me:&mdash;That, if I were in &s;ome private lodging (the meaner the le&s;s to be &s;u&s;pected, as it would be known, that I went away by his means; and he would be &s;uppo&s;ed to have pro|vided me hand&s;ome accommodations), it would be mo&s;t &s;uitable both to my mind and my &s;ituation: That this might be be&s;t, I &s;hould think, in the country for <HI>me</HI>; in town for <HI>him.</HI>&mdash;And no matter how &s;oon he was known to be there.</P>
<P>If he might deliver his opinion, he &s;aid, &s;ince I de|clined going to any of his relations, London was the only place in the world to be private in. Every new-comer in a country-town or village excited a cu|rio&s;ity: A per&s;on of my figure (and many compliments he made me) would excite more. Even me&s;&s;ages and letters, where none u&s;ed to be brought, would occa|&s;ion inquiry.

<P>My plea&s;ure &s;hould determine him, he &s;aid, be it what it would. Only that I were &s;afe, was all he was &s;olicitous about. He had lodgings in town; but he did not offer to propo&s;e them.

<P>No doubt of it, I reply'd, with an indignation in my manner, that made him run over with profe&s;&s;ions, that he was far from propo&s;ing them, or wi&s;hing for my acceptance of them.

<P>I was too peevi&s;h, and too much afflicted, and, indeed, too much incen&s;ed again&s;t him, to take well any thing he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf, I &s;aid, extremely unhappy.

<P>He was very attentive to all I &s;aid; never offering to interrupt me once. His an&s;wer to every article, almo&s;t methodically, &s;hew'd his memory.</P>
<P>What I had &s;aid, he told me, had made him very grave: And he would an&s;wer accordingly.</P>
<P>He was grieved at his heart, that he had &s;o little &s;hare in my favour or confidence, as he had the morti|fication to find, by what I had &s;aid, he had.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>reputation,</HI> he mu&s;t be very &s;incere with me: That could not &s;uffer half &s;o much by the &s;tep I &s;o much regretted to have taken, as by the confine|ment, and equally fooli&s;h and unju&s;t treatment, I had met with from my relations: That every mouth was full of blame of them, of my brother and &s;i&s;ter parti|cularly; and of wonder at my patience: That he mu&s;t repeat, what he had written to me, he believed, more than once. That my friends them&s;elves expected, that I &s;hould take a proper opportunity to free my&s;elf from their per&s;ecutions; why el&s;e did they confine me? That my exalted character would &s;till bear me out, with tho&s;e who knew <HI>me</HI>; who knew my <HI>brother</HI>'s and <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI>'s motives; and who knew the wretch they were for compelling me to have.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>cloaths</HI>; Who, as matters were cir|cum&s;tanced, could expect, that I &s;hould be able to bring away any others, than tho&s;e I had on at the time? For <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> u&s;e or wear, all the Ladies of his family would take a pride to &s;upply me: For <HI>future,</HI> the product of the be&s;t looms, not only in England, but throughout the world, were at my command.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">If I wanted <HI>money,</HI> as no doubt I mu&s;t, he &s;hould be proud to &s;upply me: Would to God, he might pre|&s;ume to hope, there were but one intere&s;t between us!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then he would fain have had me to accept of 100 <HI>l.</HI> bank note; which, unawares to me, he put into my hand: But which, you may be &s;ure, I refu&s;ed with warmth.</P>
<P>He was inexpre&s;&s;ibly grieved and &s;urpri&s;ed, he &s;aid, to hear me &s;ay, he had acted <HI>artfully</HI> by me. He came provided, according to my <HI>confirm'd</HI> appoint|ment [A wretch! to upbraid me thus!], to redeem me from my per&s;ecutors; and little expected a change of &s;entiment, and that he &s;hould have &s;o much diffi|culty to prevail upon me, as he had met with: That perhaps I might think his offer to go <HI>into the garden with me,</HI> and to face my a&s;&s;embled relations, was a piece of <HI>art</HI> only: But that if I did, I wronged him: For, to this hour, &s;eeing my exce&s;&s;ive unea&s;ine&s;s, he wi&s;h'd with all his &s;oul, he had been permitted to accompany me in. It was always his maxim to brave a threatened danger&mdash;Threateners, where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats, were &s;eldom to be feared.&mdash;But had he been a&s;&s;ured of a private &s;tab, or of as many death's wounds, as there were per&s;ons in my family (made de&s;perate as he &s;hould have been by my return), he would have attended me into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>So, my dear, what I have to do, is to hold my&s;elf inexcu&s;able for meeting &s;uch a determined and auda|cious &s;pirit; that's all!&mdash;I have hardly any que&s;tion now, that he would have contrived &s;ome way or other to have got me away, had I met him at a mid|night hour, as once or twice I had thoughts to do.&mdash;And that would have been more terrible &s;till!</P>
<P>He concluded this part of his talk, with &s;aying, That he doubted not, but that, had he attended me in, he &s;hould have come off, in every-one's opinion, &s;o well, that he &s;hould have had general leave to renew his vi&s;its.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">He went on:&mdash;He mu&s;t be &s;o bold as to tell me, he &s;aid, that he &s;hould have paid a vi&s;it of this kind, but indeed accompany'd by &s;everal of his tru&s;ty friends, had I <HI>not</HI> met him&mdash;And that very after|noon too&mdash;for he could not tamely let the dreadful Wedne&s;day come, without &s;ome effort to change their determinations.</P>

<P>That therefore, for my &s;ake, as well as for his own, he had rea&s;on to wi&s;h a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o de&s;perate had been attempted to be overcome by as de&s;perate a re|medy. We all know, &s;aid he, that great ends are &s;ometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavour'd to be fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>My pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I am &s;ure, thought I, affords a &s;ad evidence of this truth!</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward. Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted at his audaciou&s;ne&s;s: At others, had the le&s;s inclination to interrupt him, being exce&s;&s;ively fatigued, and my &s;pirits &s;unk to nothing, with the view even of the be&s;t pro&s;pects with &s;uch a creature.</P>
<P>This gave him opportunity to proceed; And that he did; a&s;&s;uming a &s;till more &s;erious air.</P>
<P>As to what further remained for him to &s;ay, in an|&s;wer to what I had &s;aid, he hoped I would pardon him; but, upon his &s;oul, he was concerned, infinitely concerned, he repeated, his colour and his voice ri&s;ing, that it was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for him to ob&s;erve, how much I cho&s;e rather to have run the ri&s;que of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power to reward a man, who, I mu&s;t forgive him, had been as much in&s;ulted on <HI>my</HI> account, as <HI>I</HI> had been on <HI>his</HI>&mdash;who had watched my commands, and (pardon me, ma|dam) every <HI>changeable</HI> motion of your pen, all hours, in all weathers, and with a chearfulne&s;s and ardor, that nothing but the mo&s;t faithful and ob&s;equious pa&s;|&s;ion could in&s;pire.&mdash;</P>

<P>O Sir! Sir! are you &s;o critical then? Are you &s;o light in your anger, as to dwell upon words!&mdash;</P>
<P>And indeed, my dear, I have &s;ince thought, that his anger was not owing to that &s;udden <HI>impetus,</HI> which cannot be ea&s;ily bridled; but rather, was a &s;ort of <HI>manageable</HI> anger, let loo&s;e to intimidate me.</P>

<P>Far be it from me, Sir, to depreciate merit &s;o <HI>extraordinary.</HI> But let me &s;ay, that had it not been for the forbidden corre&s;pondence I was teazed by you into [and which I had not continued (every letter for many letters, intended to be the la&s;t), but becau&s;e I thought you a &s;ufferer from my friends], I had not been either confined or maltreated: Nor would my bro|ther's low-meant violence have had a foundation to work upon.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">I am far from thinking my ca&s;e would have been &s;o very de&s;perate as you imagine, had I &s;tay'd.

<P>He had the a&s;&s;urance [I was now in his power] to &s;alute me, as a &s;ealing of my promi&s;e, as he called it. His motion was &s;o &s;udden, that I was not aware of it.

<P>I broke from him to write to you my preceding letter; but refu&s;ed to &s;end it by his &s;ervant, as I told you. The gentlewoman of the inn help'd me to a me&s;&s;enger, who was to carry what you &s;hould give him to Lord M.'s &s;eat in Hertford&s;hire, directed for Mrs. Greme the hou&s;ekeeper there.

<P>I looked over my little &s;tock of money; and found it to be no more than &s;even guineas and &s;ome &s;ilver: The re&s;t of my &s;tock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my &s;i&s;ter chal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enged me as to the &s;um I had by me <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 292, 293.</NOTE>: And tho&s;e I left in my e&s;critoire, little thinking to be pre|vailed upon to go away with him.</P>

<P>There are, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, a multitude of punctilios and decorums, which a young creature mu&s;t di&s;pen&s;e with, who, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, makes a man the intimate attendant of her per&s;on.

<P><HI>Amu&s;e them,</HI> my dear!&mdash;Amu&s;e whom?&mdash;My fa|ther!&mdash;my uncles!&mdash;But it mu&s;t be &s;o!&mdash;All his expedients ready, you &s;ee!&mdash;</P>
<P>I had no objection to this: And I have written ac|cordingly. But what an&s;wer I &s;hall have, or whether any, that is what gives me no &s;mall anxiety.</P>
<P>This, however, is one con&s;olation, that, if I have an an&s;wer, and altho' my brother &s;hould be the writer, it cannot be more &s;evere than the treatment I have of late received from him and my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace &s;taid out about an hour and half; and then came in; impatiently &s;ending up to me no le&s;s than four times, to expre&s;s his de&s;ire of my company. But I &s;ent him word as often, that I was bu&s;y; and, at la&s;t, that I &s;hould be &s;o, till dinner was ready. So he ha&s;ten'd that, as I heard him now-and-then, with a hearty cur&s;e upon the cook and waiters.</P>
<P>This is another of his perfections. I ventured afterwards to check him for his free words, as we &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at dinner.</P>
<P>Having heard him &s;wear at his &s;ervant, when below whom, neverthele&s;s, he owns to be a good one; It is a &s;ad life, &s;aid I, the&s;e innkeepers live, Mr. Love|lace.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e of the &s;oldiers they are obliged to quarter; who are generally, I believe, wretched profligates.

<P>I am &s;ure they de&s;erve cha&s;ti&s;ement, reply'd I&mdash;For &s;wearing is a mo&s;t <HI>unmanly</HI> vice, and cur&s;ing as <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>low</HI> a one; &s;ince it proclaims the profligate's want of power, and his wickedne&s;s at the &s;ame time: for, could &s;uch a one <HI>puni&s;h</HI> as he <HI>&s;peaks,</HI> he would be a fiend!</P>
<P>Charmingly ob&s;erved, by my &s;oul, madam!&mdash;The next trooper I hear &s;wear and cur&s;e, I'll tell him what an <HI>unmanly,</HI> and what a <HI>poor</HI> whelp he is.</P>
<P>Mrs. Greme came to pay her duty to me, as Mr. Lovelace called it; and was very urgent with me to go to her Lord's hou&s;e; letting me know what hand|&s;ome things &s;he had heard her Lord, and his two nieces, and all the family, &s;ay of me; and what wi&s;hes, for &s;everal months pa&s;t, they had put up for the honour &s;he now hoped &s;oon would be done them all.</P>
<P>This gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction, as it confirmed from the mouth of a very good &s;ort of woman, all that Mr. Lovelace had told me.</P>
<P>Upon inquiry about a private lodging, &s;he recom|mended me to a &s;i&s;ter-in-law of hers, eight miles from thence&mdash;Where I now am. And what plea&s;ed me the better, was, that Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could &s;ee &s;he was infinitely ob&s;ervant] obliged her, of his
<PB N="48" REF="49">
own motion, to accompany me in the chai&s;e; him&s;elf riding on hor&s;eback, with his two &s;ervants, and one of Lord M.'s. And here we arrived about four o'clock.</P>
<P>But, as I told you in my former, the lodgings are inconvenient, and Mr. Lovelace found great fault with them; telling Mrs. Greme, who had &s;aid, they were not worthy of us, that they came not up even to her de&s;cription of them; that, as the hou&s;e was a mile from a town, it was not proper for him to be &s;o far di&s;tant from me, le&s;t any thing &s;hould happen: And yet the apartments were not &s;eparate and di&s;tinct enough for me to like, he was &s;ure.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be agreeable enough from him, you'll believe.</P>
<P>Mrs. Greme and I had a good deal of talk in the chai&s;e about him: She was very ea&s;y and free in her an&s;wers to all I a&s;ked; and has a very &s;erious turn, I find.</P>
<P>I led her on to &s;ay to the following effect; &s;ome part of it not unlike what his uncle's di&s;mi&s;&s;ed bailiff had &s;aid before; by which I find that all the &s;ervants opinion of him is alike.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Mr. Lovelace was a generous man: That it was hard to &s;ay, whether the &s;ervants of her Lord's family lov'd or fear'd him mo&s;t: That her Lord had a very great affection for him: That his two noble aunts were no le&s;s fond of him: That his two cou&s;ins Montague were as good-natured young La|dies as ever lived: That his uncle and aunts had propo&s;ed &s;everal Ladies to him, before he made his addre&s;&s;es to me; and even &s;ince; de&s;pairing to move me, and my friends, in his favour&mdash;But that he had no thoughts of marrying at all, &s;he had heard him &s;ay, if it were not to me: That as well her Lord as his &s;i&s;ters, were a good deal concerned at the contempts, and ill-u&s;age, he received from my fa+mily: But admired my character, and wi&s;h'd to
<PB N="49" REF="50">
have him married to me, altho' I were not to have a &s;hilling, in preference to any other per&s;on, from the opinion that they had of the influence I &s;hould have over him: That, to be &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, Mr. Lovelace was a wild gentleman: But that was a di&s;|temper which would cure it&s;elf: That her Lord de|lighted in his company, whenever he could get it: But that they often fell out; and his Lord&s;hip was always forced to &s;ubmit: Indeed, was half-afraid of him, &s;he believ'd&mdash;For he would do as he plea&s;ed. She mingled a thou&s;and pities often, that he acted not up to the talents lent him&mdash;Yet would have it, that he had fine qualities to found a reformation upon; and, when the happy day came, would make amends for all: And of this all his friends were &s;o a&s;&s;ured, that they wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o earne&s;tly, as for his marriage.'</Q></P>
<P>This, indifferent as it is, is better than my brother &s;ays of him.</P>
<P>The people of the hou&s;e here are very hone&s;t-looking indu&s;trious folks: Mrs. Sorlings is the gentle|woman's name. The farm &s;eems well-&s;tock'd, and thriving. She is a widow; has two &s;ons, men grown, who vie with each other which &s;hall take mo&s;t pains in promoting the common good; and they are both of them, I already &s;ee, more re&s;pectful to two mode&s;t young women, their &s;i&s;ters, than my brother was to his &s;i&s;ter. I believe I mu&s;t &s;tay here longer than at fir&s;t I thought I &s;hould.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that, before I &s;et out for this place, I received your kind letter. Every thing is kind from &s;o dear a friend.

<P>I have not the better opinion of Mr. Lovelace for his extravagant volubility. He is too full of profe&s;|&s;ions: He &s;ays too many fine things <HI>of</HI> me, and <HI>to</HI> me:
<PB N="50" REF="51">
True re&s;pect, true value, I think, lies not in words: Words <HI>cannot</HI> expre&s;s it: The &s;ilent awe, the humble, the doubting eye, and even the he&s;itating voice, better &s;hew it by much, than, as Shake&s;peare &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;The rattling tongue</L>
<L>Of &s;aucy and audacious eloquence.</L></Q></P>
<P>The man, to be &s;ure, is, at times, all upon the <HI>ec&s;tatic,</HI> one of his phra&s;es; but, to my &s;hame and confu&s;ion, I know too well what to attribute it to, in a great mea&s;ure&mdash;To his <HI>triumph,</HI> my dear, in one word; it needs no further explanation; and, to give it <HI>that</HI> word, perhaps, equally expo&s;es my vanity, and condemns my folly.</P>
<P>We have been alarmed with notions of a pur&s;uit, founded upon a letter from his intelligencer.</P>
<P>How do different circum&s;tances &s;anctify or con|demn an action!&mdash;What care ought we to take not to confound the di&s;tinctions of right and wrong, when <HI>&s;elf</HI> comes into the que&s;tion! I condemn'd in him the corrupting of a &s;ervant of my papa's; and now I am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of it, by inquiring what he hears, by that or any other way, of the manner in which my relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight, to be &s;ure, it mu&s;t appear to them&mdash;That's a &s;ad thing!&mdash;Yet how, as I am &s;ituated, can I put them right?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t heavily, he &s;ays, they take it; but &s;hew not &s;o much grief as rage.&mdash;And he can hardly have pa|tience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother again&s;t him&s;elf&mdash;Then a merit is made to me of his forbearance.</P>
<P>What a &s;atisfaction am I robbed of, my deare&s;t friend, by this ra&s;h action? I can now, too late, judge of the difference there is in being an <HI>offended</HI> rather than an <HI>offending</HI> per&s;on!&mdash;What would I give to have it once more in my power to &s;ay I <HI>&s;uffer'd</HI> wrong, rather than <HI>did</HI> wrong? That others were more
<PB N="51" REF="52">
wanting in their kindne&s;s to me, than I in duty (where duty is owing) to them?&mdash;</P>
<P>Fie upon me! for meeting the &s;educer!&mdash;Let all end as happily as it now may, I have laid up for my|&s;elf remor&s;e for my whole life.</P>
<P>What more concerns me is, that every time I &s;ee this man, I am &s;till at a greater lo&s;s than before what to make of him. I watch every turn of his counte|nance: And I think I &s;ee very deep lines in it. He looks with more meaning, I verily think, than he u&s;ed to look; yet not more &s;erious; not le&s;s gay&mdash;I don't know how he looks&mdash;But with more confidence a great deal than formerly; and yet he never wanted that.</P>
<P>But here is the thing: I behold him with fear now, as knowing the power my indi&s;cretion has given him over me. And well may <HI>he</HI> look more elate, when he &s;ees me deprived of all the &s;elf-&s;uppo&s;ed &s;ignifi|cance, which adorns and exalts a per&s;on who has been accu&s;tomed to re&s;pect; and who now, by a con&s;cious inferiority, allows her&s;elf to be overcome, and in a &s;tate of obligation, as I may &s;ay, to her new pro|tector.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end this, as my former, by a poor man, who travels every day with pedlary matters, who will leave it at Mrs. Knollys's, as you direct.</P>
<P>If you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of their health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy &s;tep, pray be &s;o good as to write me a few lines by the me&s;&s;enger, if his waiting for them can be known to you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Wedn. Apr. 11, 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOU claime&s;t my promi&s;e, that I will be as particular as po&s;&s;ible, in all that pa&s;&s;es between me and my godde&s;s. Indeed, I never had a more il|lu&s;trious &s;ubject to exerci&s;e my pen upon: And, more|over, I have lei&s;ure; for, by her good-will, my ac|ce&s;s would be as difficult to her, as that of the humble&s;t &s;lave to an ea&s;tern monarch. Nothing, then, but inclination to write, can be wanting: And &s;ince our friend&s;hip, and thy obliging attendance upon me at the White Hart, will not excu&s;e That, I will endeavour to keep my word.</P>
<P>I parted with thee and thy brethren, with a full re&s;olution, thou knowe&s;t, to rejoin ye, if &s;he once again di&s;appointed me, in order to go together, at|tended by our &s;ervants, for &s;hew-&s;ake, to her gloomy father; and demand audience of the tyrant, upon the freedoms taken with my character: And to have try'd by fair means, if fair would do, to make them change their re&s;olutions; and treat <HI>her</HI> with le&s;s in|humanity, and <HI>me</HI> with more civility.</P>
<P>I told thee my rea&s;ons for not going in &s;earch of a letter of countermand. I was right; for, if I had, I &s;hould have found &s;uch a one; and had I received it, &s;he would not have met me. Did &s;he think, that after I had been more than once di&s;appointed, I would not keep her to her promi&s;e; that I would not hold her to it, when I had got her in &s;o deeply?</P>
<P>The moment I heard the door unbolt, I was &s;ure of her. That motion made my heart bound to my throat. But when That was followed with the pre|&s;ence of my charmer, fla&s;hing upon me all at once in a flood of brightne&s;s, &s;weetly dre&s;s'd, tho' all un|prepar'd
<PB N="53" REF="54">
for a journey, I trod air, and hardly thought my&s;elf a mortal.</P>
<P>Thou &s;halt judge of her dre&s;s, as, at the moment &s;he appear'd to me, and as, upon a nearer ob&s;erva|tion, &s;he really was. I am a critic, thou knowe&s;t, in womens dre&s;&s;es.&mdash;Many a one have I taught to dre&s;s, and help'd to undre&s;s. But there is &s;uch a native ele|gance in this lady, that &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;es all that I could imagine &s;urpa&s;&s;ing&mdash;But then her per&s;on adorns what &s;he wears, more than dre&s;s can adorn her; and that's her excellence.</P>
<P>Expect therefore, a faint &s;ketch of her admirable per&s;on with her dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Her wax-like fle&s;h [for, after all, fle&s;h and blood I think &s;he is!] by its delicacy and firmne&s;s, an&s;wers for the &s;oundne&s;s of her health. Thou ha&s;t often heard me launch out in prai&s;e of her complexion. I never in my life beheld a &s;kin &s;o <HI>illu&s;triou&s;ly</HI> fair. The lily and the driven &s;now it is non&s;en&s;e to talk of: Her lawn and her laces one might, indeed, compare to tho&s;e: But what a whited wall would a woman appear to be, who had a complexion which would ju&s;tify &s;uch unnatural compari&s;ons? But this lady is all-alive, all-glowing, all charming fle&s;h and blood, yet &s;o clear, that every meandring vein is to be &s;een in all the lovely parts of her, which cu&s;tom permits to be vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t heard me al&s;o de&s;cribe the wavy ringlets of her &s;hining hair, needing neither art nor powder; of it&s;elf an ornament, defying all other ornaments; wantoning in and about a neck that is beautiful be|yond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Her head-dre&s;s was a Bru&s;&s;els-lace mob, peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of her features. A &s;ky-blue ribband illu&s;trated that.&mdash;But altho' the weather was &s;omewhat &s;harp, &s;he had not on either hat or hood; for, be&s;ides that &s;he loves to u&s;e her|&s;elf hardily (by which means, and by a temperance
<PB N="54" REF="55">
truly exemplary, &s;he is allowed to have given high health and vigour to an originally tender con&s;titution), &s;he &s;eems to have intended to &s;hew me, that &s;he was determin'd not to &s;tand to her appointment. O Jack! that &s;uch a &s;weet girl &s;hould be a rogue!</P>
<P>Her morning-gown was a pale primro&s;e-colour'd padua&s;oy: The cuffs and robings curiou&s;ly embroi|der'd by the fingers of this ever-charming Ariadne, in a running pattern of violets, and their leaves; the light in the flowers &s;ilver; gold in the leaves. A pair of diamond &s;naps in her ears. A white handkerchief, wrought by the &s;ame inimitable fingers, concealed&mdash;O Belford! what &s;till more inimitable beauties did it not conceal!&mdash;And I &s;aw, all the way we rode, the bounding heart; by its throbbing motions I &s;aw it! dancing beneath the charming umbrage.</P>
<P>Her ruffles were the &s;ame as her mob. Her apron a flower'd lawn. Her coat white &s;atten, quilted: Blue &s;atten her &s;hoes, braided with the &s;ame colour, without lace; for what need has the prettie&s;t foot in the world of ornament? Neat buckles in them: And on her charming arms a pair of black velvet glove-like muffs, of her own invention; for &s;he makes and gives fa&s;hions as &s;he plea&s;es. Her hands, velvet of them&s;elves, thus uncover'd, the freer to be gra&s;p'd by tho&s;e of her adorer.</P>
<P>I have told thee what were <HI>my</HI> tran&s;ports, when the undrawn bolt pre&s;ented to me my long-expected godde&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Her</HI> emotions were more &s;weetly femi|nine, after the fir&s;t moments; for then the fire of her &s;tarry eyes began to &s;ink into a le&s;s-dazling languor. She trembled: Nor knew &s;he how to &s;upport the agi|tations of a heart &s;he had never found &s;o ungovernable. She was even fainting, when I cla&s;p'd her in my &s;up|porting arms. What a precious moment That! How near, how &s;weetly near, the throbbing partners!</P>
<P>By her dre&s;s, I &s;aw, as I ob&s;erv'd before, how un|prepar'd &s;he was for a journey; and not doubting her
<PB N="55" REF="56">
intention once more to di&s;appoint me, I would have drawn her after me. Then began a contention the mo&s;t vehement that ever I had with lady. It would pain thy friendly heart to be told the infinite trouble I had with her. I begg'd, I pray'd; on my knees I begg'd and pray'd her, yet in vain, to an&s;wer her own appointment: And had I not happily provided for &s;uch a &s;truggle, knowing whom I had to deal with, I had certainly failed in my de&s;ign; and as cer|tainly would have accompanied her in, without thee and thy brethren: And who knows what might have been the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>But my hone&s;t agent an&s;wering my &s;ignal, tho' not quite &s;o &s;oon as I expected, in the manner thou knowe&s;t I had laid down to him, They are coming! They are coming!&mdash;Fly, fly, my beloved creature, cry'd I, drawing my &s;word with a flouri&s;h, as if I would have &s;lain half an hundred of them; and, &s;eiz|ing her trembling hands, I drew her after me &s;o &s;wiftly, that <HI>my</HI> feet, winged by love, could hardly keep pace with <HI>her</HI> feet, agitated by fear.&mdash;And &s;o I became her emperor!</P>
<P>I'll tell thee all, when I &s;ee thee: And thou &s;halt then judge of my difficulties, and of her perver&s;ene&s;s. And thou wilt rejoice with me, at my conque&s;t over &s;uch a watchful and open-ey'd charmer.</P>
<P>But &s;ee&s;t thou not now [as I think I do] the wind-out&s;tripping fair-one flying <HI>from</HI> her love <HI>to</HI> her love?&mdash;Is there not &s;uch a game?&mdash;Nay, flying from friends &s;he was re&s;olved not to abandon, to the man &s;he was determined not to go off with?&mdash;The Sex! The Sex, all over!&mdash;Charming contradiction!&mdash;Hah, hah, hah, hah!&mdash;I mu&s;t here lay down my pen, to hold my &s;ides; for I mu&s;t have my laugh out, now the fit is upon me!</P>
<P>I believe&mdash;I believe&mdash;Hah, hah, hah!&mdash;I believe, Jack, my dogs conclude me mad: For here has one
<PB N="56" REF="57">
of them popt in, as if to &s;ee what ailed me; or whom I had with me.&mdash;The whore&s;on caught the laugh, as he went out.&mdash;Hah, hah, hah!&mdash;An <HI>im</HI>-pudent dog!&mdash;O Jack, knewe&s;t thou my conceit, and were but thy laugh joined to mine, I believe it would hold me for an hour longer.</P>
<P>But, O my be&s;t-beloved fair-one, repine not thou at the arts by which thou &s;u&s;pecte&s;t thy fruitle&s;s vi|gilance has been over-watched.&mdash;Take care, that thou provoke&s;t not new ones, that may be &s;till more worthy of thee. If once thy emperor decrees thy fall, thou &s;halt greatly fall. Thou &s;halt have cau&s;e, if that comes to pa&s;s which <HI>may</HI> come to pa&s;s [for why woulde&s;t thou put off marriage to &s;o long a day, as till thou had&s;t rea&s;on to be convinced of my reforma|tion, deare&s;t?]; thou &s;halt have cau&s;e, never fear, to &s;it down more di&s;&s;atisfied with thy &s;tars, than with thy&s;elf. And come the wor&s;t to the wor&s;t, glorious terms will I give thee. Thy gari&s;on, with general <HI>Prudence</HI> at the head, and governor <HI>Watchfulne&s;s</HI> bringing up the rear, &s;hall be allowed to march out with all the honours due to &s;o brave a re&s;i&s;tance. And all thy &s;ex, and all mine, that hear of my &s;tratagems, and thy conduct, &s;hall acknowlege the fortre&s;s as nobly won, as defended.</P>
<P>Thou wilt not dare, methinks I hear thee &s;ay, to attempt to reduce &s;uch a godde&s;s as This, to a &s;tandard unworthy of her excellencies. It is impo&s;|&s;ible, Lovelace, that thou &s;hould&s;t intend to break thro' oaths and prote&s;tations &s;o &s;olemn.</P>
<P>That I did <HI>not</HI> intend it, is certain. That I <HI>do</HI> in|tend it, I cannot (my heart, my reverence for her, will not let me) &s;ay. But knowe&s;t thou not my aver&s;ion to the &s;tate of &s;hackles?&mdash;And is &s;he not IN MY POWER?</P>
<P>And wilt thou, Lovelace, abu&s;e that power, which&mdash;</P>
<P>Which what, puppy?&mdash;Which I obtain'd not by her own con&s;ent, but again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">But which thou had&s;t never obtained, had &s;he not e&s;teem'd thee above all men.</P>
<P>And which I had never taken &s;o much pains to ob|tain, had I not loved her above all women.&mdash;So far upon a par, Jack!&mdash;And, if thou pleade&s;t honour, ought not honour to be mutual? If mutual, does it not imply mutual tru&s;t, mutual confidence?&mdash;And what have I had of <HI>that</HI> from her to boa&s;t of?&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t the whole progre&s;s of our warfare: For a warfare it has truly been; and far, very far, from an amorous warfare too. Doubts, mi&s;tru&s;ts, upbraidings, on her part: Humiliations the mo&s;t ab|ject, on mine. Obliged to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch airs of re|formation, that every varlet of ye has been afraid I &s;hould reclaim in good earne&s;t. And ha&s;t thou not thy&s;elf frequently ob&s;erved to me, how aukwardly I returned to my u&s;ual gaiety, after I had been within a mile of her father's garden-wall, altho' I had not &s;een her?</P>
<P>Does &s;he not de&s;erve to pay for all this?&mdash;To make an hone&s;t fellow look like an hypocrite; what a vile thing is that!</P>
<P>Then thou knowe&s;t what a fal&s;e little rogue &s;he has been! How little con&s;cience &s;he has made of di&s;ap|pointing me!&mdash;Ha&s;t thou not been a witne&s;s of my ravings, on this &s;core?&mdash;Have I not, in the height of them, vowed revenge upon the faithle&s;s charmer?&mdash;And, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be for&s;worn, whether I an&s;wer her expectations, or follow my own inclinations [as Cromwell &s;aid, If it mu&s;t be my head, or the king's], and the option in my own power; can I he&s;itate a moment which to choo&s;e?</P>
<P>Then, I fancy, by her circum&s;pection, and her continual grief, that &s;he expects &s;ome mi&s;chief from me. I don't care to di&s;appoint any-body I have a value for.</P>
<P>But O the noble, the exalted creature! Who can avoid he&s;itating when he thinks of an offence again&s;t her?&mdash;Who can but pity&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">Yet, on the other hand, &s;o loth at la&s;t to ven|ture, tho' threatened to be forced into the nuptial fet|ters with a man, whom to look upon as a rival, is to di&s;grace my&s;elf!&mdash;So &s;ullen, now &s;he has ven|tured!&mdash;What title has <HI>&s;he</HI> to pity; and to a pity which her pride would make her di&s;claim?</P>
<P>But I re&s;olve not <HI>any way.</HI> I will &s;ee how <HI>her</HI> will works; and how <HI>my</HI> will leads me on. I will give the combatants fair play. And I find, every time I at|tend her, that &s;he is le&s;s in <HI>my</HI> power&mdash;I more in <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, a fooli&s;h little rogue! to forbid me to think of marriage till I am a reformed man! Till the Im|placables of her family change their natures, and be|come placable!</P>
<P>It is true, when &s;he was for making tho&s;e condi|tions, &s;he did not think, that, without any, &s;he &s;hould be cheated out of her&s;elf; for &s;o the dear &s;oul, as thou may&s;t hear in its place, phra&s;es it.</P>
<P>How it &s;wells my pride, to have been able to out|wit &s;uch a vigilant charmer!&mdash;I am taller by half a yard, in my imagination, than I was!&mdash;I look <HI>down</HI> upon every-body now!&mdash;La&s;t night I was &s;till more extravagant.&mdash;I took off my hat, as I walk'd, to &s;ee if the lace were not &s;corch'd, &s;uppo&s;ing it had bru&s;h'd down a &s;tar; and, before I put it on again, in mere wantonne&s;s, and heart's-ea&s;e, I was for buffeting the moon. In &s;hort, my whole &s;oul is joy. When I go to bed, I laugh my&s;elf a&s;leep: And I awake either laughing or &s;inging.&mdash;Yet nothing <HI>nearly</HI> in view, neither.&mdash;For why?&mdash;<HI>I am not yet reform'd enough!</HI></P>
<P>I told thee at the time, if thou remembre&s;t, how capable this re&s;triction was, of being turn'd upon the over-&s;crupulous dear creature, could I once get her out of her father's hou&s;e; and were I di&s;po&s;ed to puni&s;h her for her family's faults, and for the infinite trouble &s;he her&s;elf had given me. Little thinks &s;he, that I have kept an account of both: And that, when my heart is &s;oft, and all her own, I

can but turn to my <HI>memoranda,</HI> and harden my&s;elf at once.</P>
<P>O my charmer, look to it!&mdash;Abate of thy haughty airs!&mdash;Value not thy&s;elf upon thy &s;incerity, if thou <HI>art</HI> indifferent to me!&mdash;I will not bear it <HI>Now.&mdash;Art thou not in my</HI> POWER?&mdash;Nor, if thou love&s;t me, think, that the female affectation of denying thy love, will avail thee <HI>Now,</HI> with a heart &s;o proud and &s;o jealous?&mdash;Remember, moreover, that all thy fa|mily-&s;ins are upon thy head!&mdash;</P>
<P>But, ah! Jack, when I &s;ee my Angel, when I am admitted to the pre&s;ence of this radiant Beauty, what will become of all this vapouring?&mdash;</P>
<P>But, be my end what it may, I am obliged, by thy penetration, fair-one, to proceed by the &s;ap.&mdash;<HI>Fair and &s;oftly.</HI>&mdash;A wife at any time!&mdash;That will be al|ways in my power.</P>
<P>When put to the univer&s;ity, the &s;ame cour&s;e of <HI>ini|tial &s;tudies</HI> will qualify the yonker for the one line or for the other. The genius ought to point out the future lawyer, divine, or phy&s;ician!&mdash;So the &s;ame cautious conduct, with &s;uch a vigilance, will do, ei|ther for the <HI>wife,</HI> or for the <HI>no</HI>-wife.

<P>But how I ramble!&mdash;This it is to be in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that I know not what to re&s;olve upon.</P>
<P>I'll tell thee my <HI>inclinings,</HI> as I procced. The <HI>pro's</HI> and the <HI>con's,</HI> I'll tell thee.&mdash;But being got too far from the track I &s;et out in, I will clo&s;e here. But, perhaps, may write every day &s;omething, and &s;end it as opportunity offers.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day Night, April 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your narrative, my dear. You are the &s;ame noble creature you ever were. Above di&s;gui&s;e, above art, above extenuating a failing.</P>
<P>The only family in the world, yours, &s;urely, that could have driven &s;uch a daughter into &s;uch extremi|ties.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not be &s;o very much too good for <HI>them,</HI> and for the <HI>ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>You lay the blame &s;o properly and &s;o un&s;paringly upon your meeting him, that nothing can be added to that &s;ubject by your wor&s;t enemies, were they to &s;ee what you have written.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, now I have read your narrative, that &s;o bold, and &s;o contriving a man&mdash;I am forced to break off&mdash;</P>
<P>YOU &s;tood it out much better and longer&mdash;Here again comes my bu&s;tling, jealous mother!</P>
<P>DON'T be &s;o angry at your&s;elf. Did you not do for the be&s;t at the time? As to your fir&s;t fault, the an|&s;wering his letters; it was almo&s;t incumbent upon you to a&s;&s;ume the guardian&s;hip of &s;uch a family, when the bravo of it had run riot, as he did, and brought him&s;elf into danger.</P>
<P>Except your mamma, who is kept down, have any of them common &s;en&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P>Forgive me, my dear&mdash;Here is that &s;tupid uncl  Antony of yours. A pragmatical, conceited, po&s;i|tive&mdash;He came ye&s;terday, in a fearful pucker, and puffed, and blowed, and &s;tumped about our hall and parlour. while his me&s;&s;age was carried up.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">My mamma was dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf. The&s;e widows are as &s;tarched as the batchelors. She would not &s;ee him in a di&s;habille, for the world&mdash;What can &s;he mean by it?</P>
<P>His errand was to &s;et her again&s;t you, and to &s;hew their determined rage on your going away. The i&s;&s;ue proved it to be &s;o too evidently.</P>
<P>The odd creature de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone. I am not u&s;ed to &s;uch exceptions, whenever any vi&s;its are made to my mamma.</P>
<P>When my mamma was primm'd out, down &s;he came to him&mdash;The door was locked upon them&s;elves; the two po&s;itive heads were put together&mdash;clo&s;e to|gether, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;for I hearken'd, but could hear nothing di&s;tinctly, tho' they both &s;eem'd full of their &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I had a good mind, once or twice, to have made them open the door&mdash;Could I have been &s;ure of keeping but tolerably my temper, I would have de|manded admittance&mdash;But I was afraid, if I had ob|tained it, that I &s;hould have forgot it was my mamma's hou&s;e, and been for turning him out of it.&mdash;To come to rave again&s;t and abu&s;e my deare&s;t, deare&s;t, &s;aultle&s;s friend! and the ravings to be li&s;ten'd to&mdash;And this in order to ju&s;tify them&s;elves; the one for contributing to drive her out of her father's hou&s;e; the other for refu&s;ing her a temporary a&s;ylum, till the reconciliation could have been effected, which her du|tiful heart was &s;et upon!&mdash;And which it would have become the love my mamma had ever pretended for you, to have mediated for&mdash;Could I have had patience!</P>
<P>The <HI>i&s;&s;ue,</HI> as I &s;aid, &s;hew'd what the errand was&mdash;Its fir&s;t appearance, after the old fu&s;ty fellow was marched off [You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, my dear], was in a kind of gloomy, Harlowe-like re&s;ervedne&s;s in my mamma; which, upon a few re&s;enting flirts of mine, was followed by a rigorous prohibition of corre&s;pond|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">This put us, you may &s;uppo&s;e, upon terms not the mo&s;t agreeable. I de&s;ired to know. If I were pro|hibited <HI>dreaming</HI> of you?&mdash;For, my dear, you have all my &s;leeping, as well as waking hours.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily allow for your corre&s;pondence with your wretch, at fir&s;t [and yet your motives were ex|cellent], by the effect this prohibition has upon me; &s;ince, if po&s;&s;ible, it has made me love you better than before; and I am more de&s;irous than ever of corre|&s;ponding with you.</P>
<P>But I have &s;till a more laudable motive&mdash;I &s;hould think my&s;elf the unworthie&s;t of creatures, could I be brought to &s;light a dear friend, and &s;uch a meritorious one, in her di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I would die fir&s;t&mdash;And &s;o I told my mamma. And I have de&s;ired her not to watch me in my retired hours, nor to in&s;i&s;t upon my lying with her con&s;tantly, which &s;he now does more earne&s;tly than ever.&mdash;'Twere better, I told her, that the Harlowe-Betty were borrowed to be &s;et over me.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, who greatly honours you, has, un|known to me, interpo&s;ed &s;o warmly in your favour with my mamma, that it makes for him no &s;mall me|rit with me.</P>
<P>I cannot, at pre&s;ent, write to every particular, un|le&s;s I would be in <HI>&s;et</HI> defiance.&mdash;Teaze, teaze, teaze, for ever! The &s;ame thing, tho' an&s;wered fifty times over, is every hour to be repeated&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! what a life mu&s;t my poor papa&mdash;But I mu&s;t remem|ber to whom I am writing.</P>
<P>If this ever-active, ever-mi&s;chievous monkey of a man&mdash;This Lovelace&mdash;contrived as you &s;u&s;pect&mdash;But here comes my mamma again&mdash;Ay, &s;tay a little longer, my mamma, if you plea&s;e&mdash;I can but be &s;u&s;pected! I can but be chidden for making you wait; and chidden I am &s;ure to be, whether I do or not, in the way you are <HI>Antony'd</HI> into.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">Ble&s;s me!&mdash;how impatient!&mdash;I mu&s;t break off&mdash;</P>
<P>A CHARMING dialogue-But I am &s;ent for down in a very peremptory manner, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;What an incoherent letter will you have, when I can get it to you! But now I know where to &s;end it, Mr. Hick|man &s;hall find me a me&s;&s;enger. Yet, if he be de|tected, poor &s;oul, he will be <HI>Harlowed-off,</HI> as well as his meek mi&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, April 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment your continuation-letter, and a little ab&s;ence of my Argus-eyed mamma.&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear creature!&mdash;I can account for all your diffi|culties. A per&s;on of your delicacy!&mdash;And with &s;uch a man!&mdash;I mu&s;t be brief&mdash;</P>
<P>The man's a fool, my dear, with all his pride, and with all his complai&s;ance, and affected regards to your injunctions. Yet his ready inventions&mdash;</P>
<P>Sometimes I think you &s;hould go to Lady Betty's.&mdash;I know not what to advi&s;e you to.&mdash;I could, if you were not &s;o intent upon reconciling your&s;elf to your relations. But they are implacable, you can have no hopes from them&mdash;Your uncle's errand to my mamma may convince you of that; and if you have an an&s;wer to your letter to your &s;i&s;ter, that will confirm you, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>You need not to have been afraid of a&s;king me, Whether I thought upon reading your narrative, any extenuation could lie for what you have done. I have told you above my mind as to that&mdash;And I repeat, that I think, your <HI>provocations</HI> and <HI>inducements</HI> con&s;idered, you are free from blame: At lea&s;t, the free&s;t, that ever young creature was who took &s;uch a &s;tep.</P>
<P>But you took it not&mdash;You were driven on one &s;ide, and, po&s;&s;ibly, trick'd on the other.&mdash;If any young per&s;on on earth &s;hall be circum&s;tanced as you were, and &s;hall hold out &s;o long as you did, again&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="65">
her per&s;ecutors on one hand, and her &s;educer on the other, I will forgive her for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>All your acquaintance, you may &s;uppo&s;e, talk of no|body but you. Some, indeed, bring your admirable character again&s;t you: But nobody does, or <HI>can,</HI> ac|quit your father and uncles.</P>
<P>Every-body &s;eems apprized of your brother's and &s;i&s;ter's motives. It is, no doubt, the very thing they aimed to drive you to, by the various attacks they made upon you; unhoping (as they might do all the time) the &s;ucce&s;s. They knew, that if once you were re&s;tored to favour, Love &s;u&s;pended would be Love augmented, and that you mu&s;t defeat and expo&s;e them, and triumph, by your amiable qualities, and great talents, over all their arts.&mdash;And now, I hear, they enjoy their &s;ucce&s;sful malice.</P>
<P>Your father is all rage and violence. He ought, I am &s;ure, to turn his rage inward. All your family accu&s;e you of acting with deep art; and are put upon &s;uppo&s;ing, that you are actually every hour exulting over them, with your man, in the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>
<P>They all pretend now, that your trial of Wedne&s;|day was to be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Advantage would indeed, my mamma owns, have been taken of your yielding, if you had yielded. But had you not been to be prevailed upon, they would have given up their &s;cheme, and taken your promi&s;e for renouncing Lovelace&mdash;Believe them who will! They own, however, that a mini&s;ter was to be pre|&s;ent. Mr. Solmes was to be at hand. And your father was previou&s;ly to try his authority over you, in order to make you &s;ign the &s;ettlements.&mdash;All of it a romantic contrivance of your wild-headed fooli&s;h brother, I make no doubt.&mdash;Is it likely, that he and Bell would have given way to your re&s;tora|tion to favour, on any other terms than tho&s;e their hearts had been &s;o long &s;et upon?</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">How they took your flight, when they found it out, may be better &s;uppo&s;ed than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Your aunt Hervey, it &s;eems, was the fir&s;t that went down to the Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e, in order to acquaint you, that their &s;earch was over. Betty followed her; and they not finding you there, went on toward the ca&s;cade, according to a hint of yours.</P>
<P>Returning by the garden-door, they met a &s;ervant [They don't &s;ay, it was that Jo&s;eph Leman; but it is very likely, that it <HI>was</HI> he] running, as he &s;aid, from pur&s;uing Mr. Lovelace (a great hedge-&s;take in his hand, and out of breath), to alarm the family.</P>
<P>If it were this fellow, and if he were employed in the double agency of cheating them, and cheating you, what &s;hall we think of the wretch you are with?&mdash;Run away from him, my dear, if &s;o&mdash;No matter to whom&mdash;or marry him, if you cannot.</P>
<P>Your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow [evidently when too late for pur&s;uit]. They got together, and, when a po&s;&s;e, ran to the place of interview; and &s;ome of them as far as to the tracks of the chariot-wheels, without &s;top|ping. And having heard the man's tale, upon the &s;pot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding and rage, and grief, were echoed from the different per|&s;ons, according to their different tempers and con|ceptions. And they returned like fools as they went.</P>
<P>Your brother, at fir&s;t, ordered hor&s;es and armed men, to be got ready for a pur&s;uit. Solmes and your uncle Tony were to be of the party. But your mamma and your aunt Hervey di&s;&s;uaded them from it, for fear of adding evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken mea&s;ures to &s;upport him&s;elf in what he had done; and e&s;pecially when the &s;ervant declared, that he &s;aw you run with him, as fa&s;t as you could &s;et foot to ground; and that there were
<PB N="66" REF="67">
&s;everal armed men on hor&s;eback at a &s;mall di&s;tance off.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>MY mamma's ab&s;ence was owing to her &s;u&s;picion, that the Knollys's were to a&s;&s;i&s;t in our corre&s;pond|ence. She made them a vi&s;it upon it. She does every thing at once. And they have promi&s;ed, that no more letters &s;hall be left there, without her know|lege.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hickman has engaged one Filmer, a hu&s;|bandman, in the lane we call Finch-lane, near us to receive them. Thither you will be plea&s;ed to di|rect yours, under cover, to Mr. John Soberton; and Mr. Hickman him&s;elf will call for them there; and there &s;hall leave mine. It goes again&s;t me too, to make him &s;o u&s;eful to me.&mdash;He looks already &s;o proud upon it!&mdash;I &s;hall have him (who knows?) give him&s;elf airs.&mdash;He had be&s;t con&s;ider, that the favour he has been long aiming at, may put him into a very dangerous, a very tickli&s;h &s;ituation. He that can oblige, may di&s;oblige&mdash;Happy for &s;ome people not to have it in their power to offend!</P>
<P>I will have patience, if I can, for a while, to &s;ee if the&s;e bu&s;tlings in my mamma will &s;ub&s;ide&mdash;But upon my word, I will not long bear this u&s;age.</P>
<P>Sometimes I am ready to think, that my mamma carries it thus on purpo&s;e to tire me out, and to make me the &s;ooner marry. If I find it to be &s;o, and that Hickman, in order to make a merit with me, is in the low plot, I will never bear him in my &s;ight.</P>
<P>Plotting wretch, as I doubt your man is, I wi&s;h to heaven, that you were married, that you might brave them all; and not be forced to hide your&s;elf, and be hurried from one inconvenient place to another. I charge you, omit not to lay hold on any hand&s;ome opportunity that may offer for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">Here again comes my mamma.</P>

<P>If you think not of marrying &s;oon, I approve of your re&s;olution to fix &s;omewhere out of his reach: And if he know not where to find you, &s;o much the better. Yet I verily believe, they would force you back, could they but come at you, if they were not afraid of <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I think, by all means, you &s;hould demand of both your tru&s;tees to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your own e&s;tate. Mean time I have &s;ixty guineas at your &s;er|vice.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, P. M. April 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM infinitely concerned, my ever-dear and ever-kind friend, that I am the &s;ad occa&s;ion of the di&s;|plea&s;ure between your mamma and you.&mdash;How many unhappy per&s;ons have I made!&mdash;</P>
<P>Had I not to con&s;ole my&s;elf, that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation, I &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all creatures. As it is, I am enough pu|ni&s;hed in the lo&s;s of my character, more valuable to me than my life; and in the cruel doubts and per|plexities which, conflicting with my hopes, and each getting the victory by turns, harrow up my &s;oul be|tween them.</P>
<P>I think, however, that you &s;hould obey your mam|ma; and decline a corre&s;pondence with &s;o unhappy a creature.&mdash;Take care how you fall into my error; for That began with carrying on a prohibited corre|&s;pondence; which I thought it in my power to di&s;con|tinue at plea&s;ure. My talent is &s;cribbling, and I the readier fell into this freedom, as I found delight in writing; having motives too, which I thought laud|able; and, at one time, the permi&s;&s;ion of all my friends, to write to him <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet (altho' I am ready &s;ometimes to di&s;continue a corre&s;pondence &s;o dear to me. In order to make your mamma ea&s;y) what hurt could a letter now-and-then
<PB N="71" REF="72">
from each do?&mdash;Mine occa&s;ionally filled with &s;elf-accu&s;ation too!&mdash;So much prudence and di&s;cre|tion as you have; and lying under no temptation of following &s;o bad an example, in writing to me.</P>
<P>I thank you mo&s;t heartily for your kind offers. You may be a&s;&s;ured, that I would &s;ooner be beholden to you, than to any body living. To Mr. Lovelace the la&s;t. So, do not think, that by declining it, I have an intention to lay my&s;elf under obligations to him.</P>
<P>I am willing to hope, notwith&s;tanding what you write, that I &s;hall have my little money, together with my cloaths, &s;ent me by my friends. They are too con|&s;iderate, &s;ome of them, at lea&s;t, to permit, that I &s;hould be put to &s;uch <HI>low</HI> difficulties. Perhaps, they will not be in ha&s;te to oblige me. But if not, I cannot yet want.&mdash;I believe you think, I mu&s;t not di&s;pute with him the expences of the road and lodgings, till I can get to a fixed one. But I hope &s;oon to put an end even to tho&s;e &s;ort of obligations.</P>
<P>Small hopes, indeed, of a reconciliation, from your account of my uncle's vi&s;it to your mamma; to &s;et her again&s;t an almo&s;t-friendle&s;s creature, whom once he loved! But is it not my duty to try for it? Ought I to widen my error, by ob&s;tinacy and re&s;entment, becau&s;e of <HI>their</HI> re&s;entment; which mu&s;t appear rea|&s;onable to them, as they &s;uppo&s;e my flight premedi|tated; and as they are made to believe, that I am capable of triumphing in it, and over them, with the man they hate? When I have done all in my power to re&s;tore my&s;elf to their favour, I &s;hall have the le&s;s to reproach my&s;elf with.&mdash;The&s;e con&s;iderations make me waver about following your advice, in relation to marriage; e&s;pecially, as he is &s;o full of his complai|&s;ance, with regard to my former conditions, which he calls my <HI>injunctions.</HI> And, at the &s;ame time, that they di&s;po&s;e me not to go to any of the Ladies of his family, who&s;e mediation my friends, as you tell me, have &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly declared again&s;t; I am ready to

<P>Yet, if I cannot get this man to leave me, how &s;hall terms to my friends be propo&s;ed?&mdash;If he do, and they &s;hould get me back again by force, which you think they would attempt but for fear of him; how will the &s;evere&s;t acts of compul&s;ion which they can have recour&s;e to, be ju&s;tified by my flight from them!&mdash;And while we are together, and unmarried, as you ob&s;erve, what cen&s;ures do I expo&s;e my&s;elf to!&mdash;And mu&s;t I then, to &s;ave the poor remains of my reputa|tion, in the world's eye, watch the gracious motion from this man's lips?</P>
<P>I will acquaint you, as you de&s;ire, with all that pa&s;&s;es between us. Hitherto I have not di&s;cover'd any thing in his behaviour that is very exceptionable. Yet I cannot &s;ay, that I think the re&s;pect he &s;hews me, an ea&s;y, unre&s;trained, and natural re&s;pect; altho' I can hardly tell where the fault is.</P>
<P>But he has doubtle&s;s an arrogant and incroaching &s;pirit. Nor is he &s;o polite as his education, and other advantages, might have made one expect him to be. He &s;eems, in &s;hort, to be one, who has always had too much of his own will, to &s;tudy to accommodate him&s;elf to that of others.</P>
<P>As to the placing of &s;ome confidence in him, I &s;hall be as ready to take your advice in this particular, as in all others, and as he will be to de&s;erve it. But tricked away as I was by him, not only again&s;t my judgment, but my inclination, can he, or any-body, expect, that I &s;hould immediately treat him with complai&s;ance, as if I acknowleged obligation to him for carrying me away?&mdash;If I did, mu&s;t he not either think me a vile di&s;&s;embler <HI>before</HI> he gained that point, or <HI>after|wards?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">Indeed, indeed, my dear, I could tear my hair, on recon&s;idering what you write (as to the probability that the dreaded Wedne&s;day was more dreaded than it needed to be), to think, that I &s;hould be thus trick'd by this man; and that, in all likelihood, thro' his vile agent Jo&s;eph Leman.

<P>I am obliged to Mr. Hickman for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he is &s;o kindly ready to give to our corre&s;pondence.

<P>The people who came about us, as we alighted, &s;eemed, by their jaw-fallen faces, and goggling eyes, to wonder at beholding a charming young lady, ma|je&s;ty in her air and a&s;pect, &s;o compo&s;edly dre&s;&s;ed, yet with features &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed, come off a journey, which had made the cattle &s;moke, and the &s;ervants &s;weat. I read their curio&s;ity, and my beloved's un|ea&s;ine&s;s. She ca&s;t a con&s;cious glance as &s;he alighted, upon her habit, which was <HI>no habit,</HI> and repul&s;ively, as I may &s;ay, quitting my a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand, hurried into the hou&s;e as fa&s;t as &s;he could.</P>
<P>Ovid was not a greater ma&s;ter of metamorpho&s;es than thy friend. To the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e I in|&s;tantly changed her into a &s;i&s;ter, brought off by &s;ur|prize from a near relation's (where &s;he had winter'd), to prevent her marrying a confounded Rake [I love always to go as near the truth as I can], whom her father and mother, her elder &s;i&s;ter, and all her loving uncles, aunts, and cou&s;ins, abhorred. This ac|counted for my charmer's expected &s;ullens; for her di&s;plea&s;ure when &s;he was to join me again, were it to hold; for her un&s;uitable dre&s;s upon a road; and, at the &s;ame time, gave her a proper and &s;ea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance of my honourable views.</P>

This, you know, was promi&s;ing nothing, becau&s;e &s;he could be offended at any time; and was to be the &s;ole judge of the offence. But it &s;hew'd her, how rea&s;onable and ju&s;t my expectations were; and that I was no en|croacher.</P>
<P>She con&s;ented; and a&s;k'd, What &s;ecurity I ex|pected?</P>
<P>Her word only.</P>
<P>She gave me her word: But I be&s;ought her excu&s;e for &s;ealing it: And, in the &s;ame moment [&s;ince to have waited for con&s;ent, would have been a&s;king for a de|nial], &s;aluted her. And, believe me, or not, but, as I hope to live, it was the fir&s;t time I had the courage to touch her charming lips with mine. And This I tell thee, Belford, that That &s;ingle pre&s;&s;ure (as mode&s;tly put too, as if I were as much a virgin as her&s;elf, that &s;he might not be afraid of me another time) delighted me more than ever I was delighted by the <HI>Ultimatum</HI> with any other woman.&mdash;So precious does awe, re|verence,
<PB N="80" REF="81">
and apprehended prohibition, make a fa|vour!</P>
<P>I am only afraid, that I &s;hall be <HI>too</HI> cunning; for &s;he does not at pre&s;ent <HI>talk</HI> enough for me. I hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet.</P>
<P>I topt the brother's part on Monday night before the landlady at St. Albans; a&s;king my &s;i&s;ter's pardon for carrying her off &s;o unprepar'd for a journey; prated of the joy my father and mother, and all our friends, would have on receiving her; and This with &s;o many circum&s;tances, that I perceived, by a look &s;he gave me, that went thro' my very reins, that I had gone too far. I apologiz'd for it, indeed, when alone; but I could not penetrate for the &s;oul of me, whether I made the matter better or wor&s;e by it.&mdash;But I am of too frank a nature: My &s;ucce&s;s, and the joy I have, becau&s;e of the jewel I am half in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, has not only unlock'd my bo&s;om, but left the door quite open.</P>
<P>This is a confounded &s;ly Sex. Would &s;he but &s;peak out, as I do&mdash;But I mu&s;t learn re&s;erves of her.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t needs be unprovided of money: But has too much pride to accept of any from me. I would have her go to town [to town, if po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t I get her to con&s;ent to go], in order to provide her&s;elf with the riche&s;t of &s;ilks which That can afford. But nei|ther is this to be a&s;&s;ented to. And yet, as my intelli|gencer acquaints me, her implacable relations are re|&s;olved to di&s;tre&s;s her all they can.</P>
<P>The&s;e wretches have been mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly raving, it &s;eems, ever &s;ince her flight; and &s;till, thank Hea|ven, continue to rave; and will, I hope, for a twelve-month to come.&mdash;Now, at la&s;t, it is my day!&mdash;</P>
<P>Bitterly do they regret, that they permitted her poultry-vi&s;its, and garden-walks, which gave her the opportunity they know &s;he had (tho' they could not find out how) to concert, as they &s;uppo&s;e, her pre-concerted e&s;cape. For, as to her dining in the

Ivy-bower, they had a cunning de&s;ign to an&s;wer upon her in that permi&s;&s;ion, as Betty told Jo&s;eph her lover <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>ii.</HI> p. <HI>304.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They lo&s;t, they &s;ay, an excellent pretence for <HI>more</HI> clo&s;ely confining her, on my threatening to re&s;cue her, if they offer'd to carry her again&s;t her will to old Antony's moated hou&s;e <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 222&mdash;228&mdash;244, 245.</NOTE>.

<P>But here my hone&s;t Jo&s;eph, who gave me the in|formation, was of admirable &s;ervice to me. I had taught him to make the Harlowes believe, that I was as communicative to my &s;ervants, as their &s;tupid James was to Jo&s;eph <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 300&mdash;304, 305.</NOTE>: Jo&s;eph, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, by tampering with Will <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">This will be far|ther explain'd in Letter <HI>xx.</HI> of this volume.</NOTE>, got at all my &s;ecrets, and was acquainted with all my motions: And having undertaken to watch all his young Lady's too <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 198&mdash;233, 234, 235.</NOTE>; the wi&s;e family were &s;ecure; and &s;o was my beloved, and &s;o was I.</P>
<P>I once had it in my head [and I hinted it to thee in a former <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>i.</HI> p. <HI>235.</HI></NOTE>,] in ca&s;e &s;uch a &s;tep &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, to attempt to carry her off by &s;urprize from the wood-hou&s;e; as it is remote from the dwelling-hou&s;e. This, had I attempted, I &s;hould certainly have effect|ed, by the help of the Confraternity: And it would have been an action worthy of us All.&mdash;But Jo|&s;eph's con&s;cience, as he called it, &s;tood in my way; for he thought, it mu&s;t have been known to be done by
<PB N="82" REF="83">
his connivance. I could, I dare &s;ay, have overcome this &s;cruple, as ea&s;ily as I did many of his others, had I not depended, at one time, upon her meeting me at a midnight or late hour; when, if &s;he had, it would have co&s;t me a fall, had &s;he gone back; at other times, upon the cunning family's doing my work for me, by driving her into my arms.</P>
<P>And then I knew, that James and Arabella were determin'd never to leave off their fooli&s;h trials and provocations, till, by tiring her out, they had either made her Solmes's wife; or guilty of &s;uch a ra&s;hne&s;s as &s;hould throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE;</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I Obliged the dear creature highly, I could perceive, by bringing Mrs. Greme to attend her, and to &s;uffer that good woman's recommendation of lodgings to take place, on her refu&s;al to go to the Lawn.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that all my views were honourable, when I had provided for her no particular lodgings, leaving it to her choice, whether &s;he'd go to M. Hall, to the Lawn, to London, or to either of my aunts.</P>
<P>She was vi&s;ibly plea&s;ed with my motion of putting Mrs. Greme into the chai&s;e with her, and riding on hor&s;eback my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some people would have been apprehen&s;ive of what might pa&s;s between her and Mrs. Greme. But as all my relations know the ju&s;tice of my intentions by her, I was in no pain on that account. E&s;pecially as I had been always above hypocri&s;y, or wanting to be thought better than I am. And indeed, what occa&s;ion has a man to be an hypocrite, who has hitherto found his views upon the Sex better an&s;wer'd, for his being known to be a rake?&mdash;Why, even my beloved here,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
deny'd not to corre&s;pond with me, tho' her friends had taught her to think me one.&mdash;Who then would be trying a new and wor&s;e character?</P>
<P>And then Mrs. Greme is a pious matron; who would not have been bia&s;s'd again&s;t the truth on any con&s;ideration. She u&s;ed formerly, while there were any hopes of my reformation, to pray for me. She hardly continues the good cu&s;tom, I doubt; for her worthy Lord makes no &s;cruple, occa&s;ionally, to rave again&s;t me to man, woman, and child, as they come in his way. He is very undutiful, as thou knowe&s;t. Surely, I may &s;ay &s;o; &s;ince all duties are recipro|cal. But for Mrs. Greme, poor woman! when my Lord has the gout, and is at the Lawn, and the chaplain not to be found, &s;he prays by him, or reads a chapter to him in the Bible, or &s;ome other good book.</P>
<P>Was it not therefore right, to introduce &s;uch a good &s;ort of woman to my beloved; and to leave them, without re&s;erve, to their own talk?&mdash;And very bu&s;y in talk I &s;aw they were, as they rode; and <HI>felt</HI> it too&mdash;For mo&s;t charmingly glowed my cheeks.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall be hone&s;t, I once more &s;ay: But as we frail mortals are not our own ma&s;ters, at all times, I mu&s;t endeavour to keep the dear creature unappre|hen&s;ive, until I can get her to our acquaintance's in London, or to &s;ome other &s;afe place there. Should I, in the interim, give her the lea&s;t room for &s;u&s;pi|cion; or offer to re&s;train her, or refu&s;e to leave her at her own will; &s;he can make her appeals to &s;trangers, and call the country in upon me; and, perhaps, throw her&s;elf upon her relations, on their own terms. And were I now to lo&s;e her, how unworthy &s;hould I be, to be the prince and leader of &s;uch a confraternity as ours!&mdash;How unable to look up among men! or to &s;hew my face among women!&mdash;As things at pre&s;ent &s;tand, &s;he dare not own, that &s;he went off again&s;t her

own con&s;ent; and I have taken care to make all the <HI>Implacables</HI> believe, that &s;he e&s;caped with it.</P>
<P>She has received an an&s;wer from Mi&s;s Howe, to the letter written to her from St. Albans <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> ii. <HI>Letter</HI> xlvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever are the contents, I know not; but &s;he was drown'd in tears; and I am the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe is a charming creature too; but con|foundedly &s;mart, and &s;piritful. I am a good deal afraid of her. Her mother can hardly keep her in. I mu&s;t continue to play off <HI>old Antony,</HI> by my <HI>hone&s;t Jo&s;eph,</HI> upon That Mother, in order to manage That daughter, and oblige my Beloved to an ab&s;olute de|pendence upon my&s;elf <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mi&s;tre&s;s Howe is impatient of contradiction. So is Mi&s;s. A young lady who is &s;en&s;ible that &s;he has all the maternal requi&s;ites her&s;elf, to be under maternal controul;&mdash;fine ground for a man of intrigue to build upon!&mdash;A mother over-notable; a daughter over-&s;en&s;ible; and their Hickman, who is&mdash;over-neither, but merely a pa&s;&s;ive&mdash;</P>
<P>Only that I have an object &s;till more de&s;irable!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet how unhappy, that the&s;e two young ladies lived &s;o near each other, and are &s;o well acquaint|ed! El&s;e how charmingly might I have managed them both!</P>

<P>NEVER was there &s;uch a pair of &s;cribbling lovers as we;&mdash;Yet perhaps whom it &s;o much concerns to keep from each other what each writes. She <HI>won't</HI> have any thing el&s;e to do. I <HI>would,</HI> if &s;he'd let me. I am not reform'd enough for a hu&s;|band.

&mdash;<HI>Patience is a virtue,</HI> Lord M. &s;ays. <HI>Slow and &s;ure,</HI> is another of his &s;entences. If I had not a great deal of that virtue, I &s;hould not have waited the Har|lowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon Them&s;elves, and upon their Godde&s;s-daughter.</P>
<P>My beloved has been writing to her &s;aucy friend, I believe, all that has befallen her, and what has pa&s;s'd between us hitherto. She will po&s;&s;ibly have fine &s;ub|jects for her pen, if &s;he be as minute as I am to thee.</P>
<P>I would not be &s;o barbarous, as to permit old An|tony to &s;et Goody Howe again&s;t her, did I not dread the con&s;equences of the corre&s;pondence between the two young ladies. So lively the one, &s;o vigilant, &s;o prudent both, who would not wi&s;h to outwit &s;uch girls, and to be able to twirl them round his finger?</P>
<P>My charmer has written to her &s;i&s;ter for her cloaths, for &s;ome gold, and for &s;ome of her books. What books can tell her more than &s;he knows? But I can. So &s;he had better &s;tudy me.</P>
<P>She <HI>may</HI> write. She mu&s;t be obliged to me at la&s;t, with all her pride. Mi&s;s Howe will be ready enough, indeed, to &s;upply her; but I que&s;tion, whether &s;he can do it without her mother, who is as covetous as the grave. And my agent's agent Antony has al|ready given the mother a hint, which will make her jealous of <HI>pecuniaries.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Mi&s;s Howe has money by her, I can put her mother upon borrowing it of her.&mdash;Nor blame me, Jack, for contrivances that have their founda|tion in genero&s;ity. Thou knowe&s;t my &s;pirit; and that I &s;hould be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer, to the amount of half my e&s;tate. Lord M. has more for me than I can ever wi&s;h for. My predo|minant pa&s;&s;ion is <HI>Girl,</HI> not <HI>Gold</HI>; nor value I <HI>This,</HI> but as it helps me to <HI>That,</HI> and gives me indepen|dence.</P>
<P>I was forced to put it into the &s;weet novice's head, as well for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake as for hers (le&s;t we &s;hould be trace|able
<PB N="86" REF="87">
by <HI>her</HI> direction), whither to direct the &s;ending of her cloaths, if they incline to do her that &s;mall piece of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If they do, I &s;hall begin to dread a reconciliation; and mu&s;t be forced to mu&s;e for a contrivance or two, to prevent it; and to avoid mi&s;chief. For that (as I have told hone&s;t Jo&s;eph Leman) is a great point with me.</P>
<P>Thou wilt think me a &s;ad fellow, I doubt.&mdash;But are not all rakes &s;ad fellows?&mdash;And thou, to thy little power, as bad as any? If thou do&s;t all that's in thy head and in thy heart to do, thou art wor&s;e than me; for I do not, I a&s;&s;ure thee.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed, and &s;he con&s;ented, that her cloaths, or whatever el&s;e her relations &s;hould think fit to &s;end her, &s;hould be directed to thee, at thy cou&s;in O&s;good's.&mdash;Let a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, at my charge, bring me any letter, or portable parcel, that &s;hall come.&mdash;If not portable, give me notice of it. But thou'lt have no trouble of this &s;ort from her relations, I dare be &s;worn. And, in this a&s;&s;urance, I will leave them, I think, to act upon their own heads. A man would have no more to an&s;wer for than needs mu&s;t.</P>
<P>But one thing, while I think of it [It is of great importance to be attended to]&mdash;You mu&s;t hereafter write to me in character, as I &s;hall do to you, How know we into who&s;e hands our letters may fall? It would be a confounded thing to be blown up by a train of one's own laying.</P>
<P>Another thing remember; I have chang'd my name: Chang'd it without an act of parliament. "Robert Huntingford" it is now.

<P>The lodgings we are in at pre&s;ent are not conve|nient.

<P>Her elder &s;i&s;ter popt upon her. The con&s;cious girl blu&s;h'd again, and look'd &s;o confounded, that I made an excu&s;e for her, which gratify'd both. Mrs. Betty, &s;aid I, I have been &s;o much pleas'd with the neatne&s;s of your dairy-works, that I could not help &s;aluting

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. From Mr. <HI>LOVELACE;</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is Wedne&s;day; the day that I was to have lo&s;t my charmer for ever!&mdash;With what high &s;ati&s;|faction and hearts-ea&s;e can I now &s;it down, and triumph over my men in &s;traw at Harlowe-Place! Yet 'tis perhaps be&s;t for them, that &s;he got off as &s;he did.

<P>But had I even gone in with her un-accompany'd, I think I had but little rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ion: For well thou knowe&s;t, that the tame Spirits which value them&s;elves upon reputation, and are held within the &s;kirts of the law by political con&s;iderations only, may be compar'd to an infectious &s;pider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can cru&s;h him, leaving all his toils defence|le&s;s, and to be bru&s;h'd down at the will of the potent invader. While a &s;illy fly, that has neither courage nor &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t, no &s;ooner gives notice by its buz and its &s;truggle, of its being intangled, but out

&s;teps the &s;elf-circum&s;cribed tyrant, winds round and round the poor in&s;ect, till he covers it with his bowel-&s;pun toils; and when &s;o fully &s;ecured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, &s;u&s;pends it, as if for a &s;pectacle to be exulted over: Then &s;talking to the door of his cell, turns about, glotes over it at a di&s;tance; and, &s;ometimes advancing, &s;ometimes retire|ing, preys at lei&s;ure upon its vitals.</P>
<P>But now I think of it, will not this compari&s;on do as well for the intangled girls, as for the tame &s;pirits?&mdash;Better o' my con&s;cience!&mdash;'Tis but comparing the &s;pider to us brave fellows; and it quadrates.</P>
<P>Whatever our hearts are in, our heads will follow. Begin with &s;piders, with flies, with what we will, the Girl is the centre of gravity, and we all naturally tend to it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, to recur; I cannot but ob&s;erve, that the&s;e tame &s;pirits &s;tand a poor chance in a fairly offen|&s;ive war with &s;uch of us mad fellows, as are above all law, and &s;corn to &s;kulk behind the hypocritical &s;creen of reputation.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, that I never &s;crupled to throw my|&s;elf among numbers of adver&s;aries; the more the &s;afer: One or two, no fear, will take the part of a &s;ingle adventurer, if not <HI>intentionally,</HI> in <HI>fact:</HI> hold|ing him in, while others hold in the principal antago|ni&s;t, to the augmentation of their mutual prowe&s;s, till both are prevailed upon to compromi&s;e, or one to ab&s;ent. So that upon the whole, the law-breakers have the advantage of the law-keepers, all the world over; at lea&s;t for a time, till they have run to the end of their race.&mdash;Add to this, in the que&s;tion between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of them mu&s;t know that they have injur'd me&mdash;Did they not, at their own church, clu&s;ter together like bees, when they &s;aw me enter it?

<P>There are already male and female dedications o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> churches.</P>
<P>St. Swithin's, St. Stephen's, St. Thomas's, St. George's, and &s;o forth, might be appropriated to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men; and the Santa Katharina's, Santa Anna's, Santa Maria's, Santa Margaretta's, for the women!</P>

<P>But how I <HI>excur&s;e!</HI>&mdash;Yet thou u&s;ed&s;t to &s;ay, thou liked&s;t my excur&s;ions.

<P>Surely, Jack, if I am in a fault in my univer&s;al adorations of the &s;ex, the <HI>women</HI> in general ought to love me the better for it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Night, April 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Always lov'd writing, and my unhappy &s;ituation gives me now enough of it; and you, I fear, too much.&mdash;I have had another very warm debate with Mr. Lovelace. It brought on the &s;ubject, which you advi&s;ed me not to decline, when it hand&s;omely offer'd And I want to have either your acquittal or blame for having &s;uffer'd it to go off without effect.</P>
<P>The impatient wretch &s;ent up to me &s;everal times while I was writing my la&s;t to you, to de&s;ire my com|pany; yet his bu&s;ine&s;s nothing particular; only to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>him</HI> talk. The man &s;eems plea&s;ed with his own volu+bility; and, whenever he has collected together abun|dance of &s;mooth things, he wants me to find ears for them.&mdash;Yet he need not: for I don't often gratify him either with giving him the prai&s;e, or &s;hewing the plea&s;ure in his verbo&s;ene&s;s, that he would be fond of.</P>
<P>When I had di&s;patch'd the letter, and given it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again: But h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be&s;ought me to &s;top, and hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Nothing, as I &s;aid, to any new purpo&s;e&mdash;but com+plainings, and tho&s;e in a manner, and with an air, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I thought, that bordered upon in&s;olence:&mdash;He coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not live, he told me, unle&s;s he had more of my com+pany, and of my <HI>indulgence</HI> too, than I had yet give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him.</P>
<P>Hereupon I &s;tept into the parlour, not a little out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> humour with him; and the more, as he has very quietly taken up his quarters here, without talking o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> removing.</P>
<P>We began pre&s;ently our angry conference. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> provoked me; and I repeated &s;everal of the plaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> things I had &s;aid before; and particularly told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that I was every hour more and more di&s;&s;atisfy'd wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

my&s;elf, and with him: That he was not a man, who, in my opinion, improv'd upon acquaintance: And that I &s;hould not be ea&s;y till he had left me to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He might be &s;urprized at my warmth, perhaps.&mdash;But really the man looked &s;o like a &s;impleton; he&s;i|tating, and having nothing to &s;ay for him&s;elf, or that &s;hould excu&s;e the peremptorine&s;s of his demand upon me [when he knew I was writing a letter, which a gentleman waited for], that I flung from him, declare|ing, that I would be mi&s;tre&s;s of my own time, and of my own actions, without being called to account for either.</P>
<P>He was very unea&s;y till he could again be admitted into my company. And when I was obliged to &s;ee him, which was &s;ooner than I liked, never did man put on a more humble and re&s;pectful demeanour.</P>
<P>He told me, That he had, upon this occa&s;ion, been entering into him&s;elf, and had found a great deal of rea&s;on to blame him&s;elf for an impatiency and incon&s;i|deration, which, altho' he meant nothing by it, mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable to one of my delicacy. That having always aimed at a manly &s;incerity and openne&s;s of heart, he had not till now di&s;cover'd, that both were very con&s;i&s;tent with that true politene&s;s, which he feared he had too much di&s;regarded, while he &s;ought to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me he had to deal with a lady, who de&s;pi&s;ed an hypo|crite, and who was above all flattery. But, from this time forth, I &s;hould find &s;uch an alteration in his whole behaviour, as might be expected from a man, who knew him&s;elf to be honoured with the pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation of a per&s;on, who had the mo&s;t deli|cate mind in the world&mdash;that was his flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, That he might perhaps expect congratulation upon the di&s;covery he had ju&s;t now made, That true politene&s;s and &s;incerity were very compatible: But that I, who had, by a perver&s;e fate, been thrown into his company, had abundant rea&s;on for regret,
<PB N="94" REF="95">
that he had not &s;ooner found this out:&mdash;Since, I believed, very few men of birth and education were &s;trangers to it.</P>
<P>He knew not, <HI>neither,</HI> he &s;aid, that he had &s;o badly behav'd him&s;elf, as to de&s;erve &s;o very &s;evere a rebuke.</P>
<P>Perhaps not. But he might, if &s;o, make another di&s;covery from what I had &s;aid; which might be to <HI>my own</HI> di&s;advantage: Since, if he had &s;o much rea|&s;on to be &s;atisfied with <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he would &s;ee what an ungenerous per&s;on he &s;poke to, who, when he &s;eem'd to give him&s;elf airs of humility, which, perhaps, he thought beneath him to a&s;&s;ume, had not the civility to make him a compliment upon them; but was ready to take him at his word.</P>
<P>He had long, with infinite plea&s;ure, the pretended flattery-hater &s;aid, admired my &s;uperior talents, and a wi&s;dom in &s;o young a Lady, perfectly &s;urpri&s;ing!</P>
<P>Lady he calls me, at every word, perhaps in com|pliment to him&s;elf. As I endeavour to repeat his words with exactne&s;s, you'll be plea&s;ed, once for all, to excu&s;e me for repeating This. I have no title to it. And I am &s;ure I am too much mortify'd at pre&s;ent to take any pride in that, or any other of his compli|ments.</P>
<P>Let him &s;tand ever &s;o low in my opinion, he &s;aid, he &s;hould believe all were ju&s;t; and that he had nothing to do, but to govern him&s;elf for the future by my example, and by the &s;tandard I &s;hould be plea&s;ed to give him.</P>
<P>I told him, I knew better, than to value my&s;elf upon his volubility of &s;peech: As he pretended to pay &s;o preferable a regard to &s;incerity, he &s;hould confine him&s;elf to the &s;trict rules of truth, when he &s;poke of me, to my&s;elf: And then, although he &s;hould be &s;o kind as to imagine, he had <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to make me a com|pliment, he would have much more to pride him&s;elf in his arts, that had made &s;o <HI>extraordinary</HI> a young crea|ture &s;o great a fool.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">Really, my dear, the man de&s;erves not politer treatment!&mdash;And then has he not made a fool, an egregious fool, of me?&mdash;I am afraid he thinks &s;o him&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>He was &s;urpriz'd! He was amaz'd! at &s;o &s;trange a turn upon him!&mdash;He was very unhappy, that nothing he could do or &s;ay would give me a good opinion of him. He wi&s;h'd I would let him know, what he <HI>could</HI> do to obtain my confidence.&mdash;</P>
<P>I told him, I de&s;ir'd his ab&s;ence, of all things. I &s;aw not, that my friends thought it worth their while to give me di&s;turbance: Therefore, if he would &s;et out for London, or Berk&s;hire, or whither he plea&s;ed, it would be mo&s;t agreeable to me, and mo&s;t reputable too.</P>
<P>He would do &s;o, he &s;aid, he intended to do &s;o, the moment I was in a place to my liking&mdash;in a place convenient for me.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> would be &s;o, I told him, when he was not here, to break in upon me, and make the apartments inconvenient.</P>
<P>He did not think this place &s;afe; and as I had not had thoughts of &s;taying here, he had not been &s;o &s;oli|citous, as otherwi&s;e he &s;hould have been, to injoin privacy to his &s;ervants, nor to Mrs. Greme, at her leaving me; and there were two or three gentlemen in the neighbourhood, he &s;aid, with who&s;e &s;ervants his go&s;&s;iping ra&s;cals had &s;craped acquaintance: So that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended.&mdash;But fix upon any place in England, where I could be out of danger, and undi&s;covered, and he would go to the furthermo&s;t part of the king's dominions, if, by doing &s;o, he could make me ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I told him plainly, that I &s;hould never be in humour with my&s;elf for meeting him; nor with him, for &s;educing me away: That my regrets increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hed: That my reputation was wounded: That nothing I could do would now retrieve it: And
<PB N="96" REF="97">
that he mu&s;t not wonder, if I every hour grew more and more unea&s;y both with my&s;elf and him: That upon the whole, I was willing to take care of my&s;elf; and when <HI>he</HI> had left me, I &s;hould be&s;t know what to re&s;olve upon, and whither to go.</P>
<P>He wi&s;h'd, he &s;aid, he were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend to infringe upon the articles that I had &s;tipulated and in&s;i&s;ted upon, to make one humble propo&s;al to me.&mdash;But the &s;acred regard he was determin'd to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly as I had on Monday la&s;t put it into his power to &s;erve me), would not permit him to make it, unle&s;s I would promi&s;e to excu&s;e him, if I did not approve of it.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, What he would &s;ay?</P>
<P>He prefaced and paraded on; and then out came, with great diffidence, and many apologies, and a ba&s;h|fulne&s;s which &s;at very aukwardly upon him, a propo|&s;al of &s;peedy &s;olemnization: Which, he &s;aid, would put all right: would make my fir&s;t three or four months, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed in ob&s;curity and apprehen&s;ion, a round of vi&s;its and vi&s;itings to and from all his relations; To Mi&s;s Howe; To whom I plea&s;ed: And would pave the way to the reconci|liation I had &s;o much at heart.</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> advice had great weight with me ju&s;t then, as well as his rea&s;ons, and the con&s;ideration of my un|happy &s;ituation: But what could I &s;ay? I wanted &s;omebody to &s;peak for me: I could not, all at once, act as if I thought, that <HI>all punctilio was at an end.</HI> I was unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>was</HI> &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>The man &s;aw I was not angry at his motion. I only blu&s;h'd up to the ears; that I am &s;ure I did: Look'd &s;illy, and like a fool.</P>
<P>He wants not courage. Would he have had me catch at his fir&s;t, at his <HI>very</HI> fir&s;t word?&mdash;I was <HI>&s;ilent</HI> too!&mdash;And do not the bold &s;ex take &s;ilence for a mark of favour?&mdash;Then, <HI>&s;o lately</HI> in my father's hou&s;e!
<PB N="97" REF="98">
Having, al&s;o, declared to him in my letters, before I had your advice, that I would not think of marriage, till he had pa&s;&s;ed thro' a &s;tate of probation, as I may call it&mdash;How was it po&s;&s;ible, I could encourage, with very ready &s;igns of approbation, &s;uch an early pro|po&s;al? e&s;pecially &s;o &s;oon after the free treatment he had provoked from me.&mdash;If I were to die, I could not.</P>
<P>He look'd at me with great confidence; as if (not|with&s;tanding his contradictory ba&s;hfulne&s;s) he would look me through, while my eye but now-and-then could glance at him. He begg'd my pardon with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s: He was <HI>afraid</HI> I would think he de&s;erv'd no other an&s;wer, but that of a contem|ptuous &s;ilence. True Love was fearful of offend|ing&mdash;[Take care, Lovelace, thought I, how yours is tried by that rule]. Indeed &s;o &s;acred a regard [fooli&s;h man!] would he have to all my declarations made before I honour'd him&mdash;</P>
<P>I would hear him no further; but withdrew in too vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, and left him to make his non&s;en&s;ical flouri&s;hes to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will only add, that, if he really wi&s;hes for a &s;peedy &s;olemnization, he never could have had a luckier time to pre&s;s for my con&s;ent to it. But he let it go off; and indignation has taken place of it: And now it &s;hall be my point, to get him at a di&s;tance from me.</P>

<PB N="104" REF="105">
What may not both men and women be brought to do, in a mortify'd &s;tate? What mind is &s;uperior to calamity?&mdash;Pride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may &s;he not be <HI>effectually</HI> humbled?</P>
<P>Then who &s;ays, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe is the pa|ragon of virtue? Is virtue it&s;elf?</P>
<P>All who know her, and have heard of her, It will be an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>Common bruit!&mdash;Is virtue to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by common bruit only?&mdash;Has her virtue ever been <HI>proved?</HI>&mdash;Who has dared to try her virtue?</P>
<P>I told thee, I would &s;it down to argue with my&s;elf; and I have drawn my&s;elf into the argumentation be|fore I was aware.</P>
<P>Let me enter into a &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I know how ungenerous an appearance what I have &s;aid, and what I have farther to &s;ay, on this topic, will have from me: But am I not bringing virtue to the touch&s;tone, with a view to exalt it, if it come out to be virtue?&mdash;Avaunt then, for one moment, all con&s;ideration that may ari&s;e from a weakne&s;s, which &s;ome would mi&s;call <HI>gratitude</HI>; and is often|times the corrupter of a heart not ignoble!</P>
<P>To the te&s;t then. And I will bring this charming creature to the &s;tricte&s;t te&s;t, that all the &s;ex, who may be &s;hewn any pa&s;&s;ages in my letters [And I know thou cheare&s;t the hearts of all thy acquaintance with &s;uch detached parts of mine, as tend not to di&s;honour characters, or reveal names. And this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by <HI>interlardment] that all the &s;ex,</HI> I &s;ay, may &s;ee what they ought to be; what is expected from them; and if they have to deal with a per&s;on of reflection and punctilio [<HI>pride,</HI> if thou wilt], how careful they ought to be, by a regular and uniform conduct, not to give him cau&s;e to think lightly of them, by favours granted, which may be interpreted into <HI>na|tural weakne&s;s.</HI> For is not a wife the keeper of a man's
<PB N="105" REF="106">
honour? And do not her faults bring more di&s;grace upon a hu&s;band, than even upon her&s;elf?</P>
<P>It is not for nothing, Jack, that I have di&s;liked the life of &s;hackles!&mdash;</P>
<P>To the te&s;t, then, as I &s;aid, &s;ince now I have the que&s;tion brought home to me, Whether I am to have a wife? And whether &s;he be to be a wife at the fir&s;t, or at the &s;econd hand?</P>
<P>I will proceed fairly; I will do the dear creature not only &s;trict, but generous ju&s;tice; for I will try her by her own judgment, as well as by our prin|ciples.</P>
<P>She blames her&s;elf for having corre&s;ponded with me, a man of free character; and one indeed who&s;e <HI>fir&s;t</HI> view it was, to draw her into this corre&s;pond|ence; and who &s;ucceeded in it, by means unknown to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now, what were her inducements to this corre|&s;pondence?&mdash;If not what her nicene&s;s makes her <HI>think</HI> blame-worthy, why does &s;he blame her&s;elf?</P>
<P>Has &s;he been <HI>capable</HI> of error?&mdash;Of per&s;i&s;ting in that error?</P>
<P>Whoever was the <HI>tempter,</HI> that is not the thing; nor what the <HI>temptation.</HI> The <HI>fact,</HI> the <HI>error,</HI> is now before us.</P>
<P>Did &s;he per&s;i&s;t in it again&s;t parental prohibition?</P>
<P>She owns &s;he did.</P>
<P>Was there ever known to be a daughter who had higher notions of the filial duty, of the parental au|thority?</P>
<P>Never.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be tho&s;e inducements, how &s;trong, that were too &s;trong for duty, in a daughter &s;o <HI>duti|ful?</HI>&mdash;What mu&s;t <HI>my</HI> thought have been of them, what <HI>my</HI> hopes built upon them, at the time, taken in this light?</P>
<P>Well, but it will be &s;aid. That her principal view was, to prevent mi&s;chief between her brother and her
<PB N="106" REF="107">
other friends, and the man vilely in&s;ulted by them all.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould &s;he be more concerned for the &s;afety of others, than they were for their own?&mdash;And had not the <HI>rencounter</HI> then happen'd?&mdash;Was a per&s;on of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through her <HI>ap|parent,</HI> her <HI>acknowleged</HI> duty, upon <HI>any</HI> con&s;idera|tion?&mdash;Much le&s;s was &s;he to be &s;o prevailed upon to prevent an <HI>apprehended</HI> evil only?</P>
<P>Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou'lt again break out and &s;ay), to be the accu&s;er!</P>
<P>But I am <HI>not</HI> the accu&s;er. I am an arguer only, and, in my heart, all the time acquit and wor&s;hip the divine creature. But let me, neverthele&s;s, examine, whether the acquittal be owing to her <HI>merit,</HI> or to my <HI>weakne&s;s,</HI> the true name for love.</P>
<P>But &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e another motive?&mdash;And that is LOVE; a motive which all the world will excu&s;e her for.&mdash;But let me tell all the world that do, <HI>not</HI> be|cau&s;e they <HI>ought,</HI> but becau&s;e all the world is apt to be mi&s;led by it.</P>
<P>Let LOVE then be the motive:&mdash;LOVE of <HI>whom?</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Lovelace</HI> is the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Is there but one Lovelace in the world?&mdash;May not more Lovelaces be attracted by &s;o fine a figure? By &s;uch exalted qualities?&mdash;It was her character that drew me to her: And it was her beauty and good &s;en&s;e, that rivetted my chains; and now, all toge|ther make me think her a &s;ubject worthy of my at|tempts; worthy of my ambition.</P>
<P>But has &s;he had the candor, the openne&s;s, to <HI>ac|knowlege</HI> that love?</P>
<P>She has not.</P>
<P>Well then, if love it be at bottom, is there not another vice lurking beneath the &s;hadow of that love?&mdash;Has &s;he not <HI>affectation?</HI>&mdash;Or is it <HI>pride of heart?</HI></P>
<P>And what re&s;ults?&mdash;Is then the divine Clari&s;&s;a
<PB N="107" REF="108">
Harlowe capable of <HI>loving</HI> a man whom &s;he ought <HI>not</HI> to love?&mdash;And is &s;he capable of <HI>affectation?</HI> And is her virtue founded in <HI>pride?</HI>&mdash;And, if this an&s;wer be affirmative, mu&s;t &s;he not then be a <HI>woman?</HI></P>
<P>And can &s;he keep this lover at bay?&mdash;Can &s;he make <HI>him,</HI> who has been accu&s;tomed to triumph over other women, tremble?&mdash;Can &s;he &s;o conduct her&s;elf, as to make him, at times, que&s;tion whether &s;he loves <HI>him</HI> or <HI>any</HI> man; yet not have the requi&s;ite command over the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf in &s;teps of the highe&s;t con&s;e|quence to her honour, as <HI>&s;he</HI> thinks [I am trying her, Jack, by her own thoughts]&mdash;but &s;uffer her&s;elf to be provoked to promi&s;e to abandon her father's hou&s;e, and go off with him, knowing his character; and even conditioning not to marry till improbable and remote contingencies were to come to pa&s;s?&mdash;What tho' the provocations were &s;uch as would ju&s;tify any other woman; yet was a CLARISSA to be &s;u&s;ceptible to pro|vocations, which &s;he thinks <HI>her&s;elf</HI> highly cen&s;urable for being &s;o much moved by?</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee th&eacute; dear creature re&s;olving to revoke her promi&s;e; yet meeting her lover; a bold and in|trepid man, who was more than once before di&s;ap|pointed by her; and who comes, as &s;he mu&s;t think, prepared to expect the fruits of her appointment, and re&s;olved to carry her off.&mdash;And let us &s;ee him actually carrying her off; and having her at his mercy&mdash;May there not be, I repeat, other Lovelaces; other like intrepid per&s;evering enterprizers; altho' they may not go to work in the &s;ame way?</P>
<P>And has then a CLARISSA [her&s;elf her judge] failed?&mdash;In &s;uch great points failed?&mdash;And may &s;he not <HI>further</HI> fail?&mdash;Fail in the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> point, to which all the other points in which &s;he has failed, have but a natural tendency?</P>
<P>Nor &s;ay thou, that virtue, in the eye of heaven, is as much a <HI>manly</HI> as a <HI>womanly</HI> grace [By virtue in this place I mean cha&s;tity and to be &s;uperior to tem|ptation;
<PB N="108" REF="109">
my Clari&s;&s;a out of the que&s;tion]. Nor a&s;k thou, Shall the man be guilty, yet expect the woman to be guiltle&s;s, and even un&s;u&s;pectable?&mdash;Urge thou not the&s;e arguments, I &s;ay, &s;ince the wife, by a failure, may do much more injury to the hu&s;band, than the hu&s;band can do to the wife, and not only to her hu&s;band, but to all his family, by obtruding another man's children into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, perhaps to the exclu&s;ion of (at lea&s;t to a participation with) his own; he believing them all the time to be his. In the eye of heaven, therefore, the &s;in <HI>cannot</HI> be equal. Be&s;ides, I have read in &s;ome place, <HI>that the woman was made for the man,</HI> not <HI>the man for the woman.</HI> Virtue then is le&s;s to be di&s;pen&s;ed with in the woman than in the man.</P>
<P>Thou, Lovelace (methinks &s;ome better man than thy&s;elf will &s;ay), to expect &s;uch perfection in a woman!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, I, may I an&s;wer. Was not the great Cae&s;ar a great Rake as to women?&mdash;Was he not called, by his very &s;oldiers, on one of his triumphant entries in|to Rome, <HI>The bald-pated lecher?</HI>&mdash;and warning given of him to the <HI>wives,</HI> as well as to the daughters, of his fellow-citizens?&mdash;Yet did not Cae&s;ar repudiate his wife for being only in company with Clodius, or rather becau&s;e Clodius, tho' by &s;urprize upon her, was found in hers? And what was the rea&s;on he gave for it?&mdash;It was this (tho' a rake him&s;elf, as I have &s;aid), and only this&mdash;<HI>The wife of Cae&s;ar mu&s;t not be &s;u|&s;pected!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar was not a prouder man than Lovelace.&mdash;</P>
<P>Go to then, Jack; nor &s;ay, nor let any-body &s;ay, in thy hearing, that Lovelace, a man valuing him&s;elf upon his ance&s;try, is &s;ingular in his expecta|tions of a wife's purity, tho' not pure him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to my CLARISSA, I own, that I hardly think, there ever was &s;uch an angel of a woman. But has &s;he not, as above, already taken &s;teps, which &s;he her|&s;elf condemns? Steps, which the world, and her own

<P>Nor think it &s;trange, that I refu&s;e to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a &s;tandard virtue, from high pro|vocations.&mdash;Are not provocations and temptations the te&s;ts of virtue?&mdash;A &s;tandard virtue mu&s;t not be allowed to be <HI>provoked</HI> to de&s;troy or annihilate it&s;elf.</P>
<P>May not then the &s;ucce&s;s of him, who could carry her <HI>thus far,</HI> be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry her <HI>farther?</HI>&mdash;'Tis but to try, Jack&mdash;Who will be afraid of a trial for this divine lady?&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t, that I have more than once, twice or thrice, been tempted to make this trial upon young ladies of name and character: But never yet found one of them to hold me out for a month; nor &s;o long as could puzzle my invention.

<P>DON'T be &s;o much concerned, my deare&s;t friend, at the bickerings between my mamma and me. We love one another dearly notwith&s;tanding. If my mamma had not me to find fault with, &s;he mu&s;t find fault with &s;omebody el&s;e.

<P>You have heard me <HI>&s;ay,</HI> that this was always the ca&s;e between us.&mdash;You could not <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> have known it. For when <HI>you</HI> was with us, you harmo|nized us both; and indeed I was always more afraid of you than of my mamma. But then that awe is accompanied with love. Your reproofs (as I have al|ways found) are &s;o charmingly mild and in&s;tructive! &s;o evidently calculated to improve, and not to pro|voke, that a generous temper mu&s;t be amended by them.&mdash;But here now, mind my mamma, when you are not with us&mdash;<HI>You &s;hall, I tell you, Nancy!&mdash;I will have it &s;o!&mdash;Don't I know be&s;t!&mdash;I won't be di&s;obey'd!</HI>&mdash;How can a daughter of &s;pirit bear &s;uch

language! Such looks too with the language; and not have a longing mind to di&s;obey?</P>
<P>Don't advi&s;e me, my dear, to obey my mamma in her prohibition of corre&s;ponding with you. She has no rea&s;on for it. Nor would &s;he of her own judg|ment have prohibited me. That odd old ambling &s;oul your uncle (who&s;e vi&s;its are frequenter than ever), in|&s;tigated by your malicious and &s;elfi&s;h brother and &s;i&s;ter, is the occa&s;ion. And they only have borrowed my mamma's lips, at the di&s;tance they are from you, for a &s;ort of &s;peaking-trumpet for them. The prohi|bition, once more I &s;ay, cannot come from her heart: But if it did, is &s;o much danger to be ap|prehended from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntinuing to write to one of my own &s;ex, as if I wrote to one of the other? Don't let dejection and di&s;appointment, and the cour&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion which you have run thro', weaken your mind, my deare&s;t creature; and make you &s;ee inconveniencies, where there po&s;&s;ibly cannot be any. If your talent is <HI>&s;cribbling,</HI> as you call it; &s;o is mine&mdash;And I will &s;cribble on, at all opportunities; and to you; let 'em &s;ay what they will.&mdash;Nor let your letters be filled with the &s;elf-accu&s;ations you mention: There is no cau&s;e for them.&mdash;I wi&s;h, that your Anna Howe, who continues in her mother's hou&s;e, were but half &s;o good as Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, who has been driven out of her father's.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay nothing upon your letter to your &s;i&s;ter, till I &s;ee the effect it will have. You hope, you tell me, that you &s;hall have your money and cloaths &s;ent you, notwith&s;tanding what I write of my opinion to the contrary.&mdash;I am &s;orry to have it to acquaint you, that I have ju&s;t now heard, that they have &s;at in coun|cil upon your letter; and that your mamma was the only per&s;on, who was for &s;ending you your things; and was over-ruled. I charge you therefore to accept of my offer, as by my la&s;t; and give me particular directions for what you want, that I can &s;upply you with be&s;ides.</P>

<P>What could he mean, by letting &s;lip &s;uch a one as that you mention?&mdash;I don't know how to blame you neither. How could you go beyond &s;ilence and blu&s;hes, when the fooli&s;h fellow came with his ob|&s;ervances of the re&s;trictions which you laid him un|der when in another &s;ituation? But, as I told you above, you really &s;trike people into awe. And, upon my word, you did not &s;pare him.</P>
<P>I repeat what I &s;aid in my la&s;t, that you have a very nice part to act: And I will add, that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part. But when the lover is exalted, the lady mu&s;t be humbled. He is naturally proud and &s;aucy. I doubt, you mu&s;t engage his <HI>pride,</HI> which he calls his <HI>honour:</HI> And that you mu&s;t throw off a little more of the veil. And I would have you re&s;train your wi&s;hes before him, that you had not met him; and the like.&mdash;What &s;ignifies wi&s;hing, my dear?&mdash;He will not bear it. You can hardly expect that he will.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it vexes me to the very bottom of my pride, that any wretch of that &s;ex &s;hould have &s;uch a triumph over &s;uch a lady.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, but &s;ay, that I am charmed with your &s;pirit. So much &s;weetne&s;s, where &s;weetne&s;s is requi&s;ite; &s;o much &s;pirit, where &s;pirit is called for&mdash;What a <HI>true</HI> magnanimity!</P>
<P>But I doubt, in your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, you mu&s;t endeavour after a little more of the re&s;erve, and palliate a little.&mdash;That humility which he puts on when you ri&s;e upon him, is not natural to him.</P>
<P>Methinks I &s;ee the man he&s;itating, and looking like the fool you paint him, under your corrective &s;upe|riority!
<PB N="116" REF="117">
&mdash;But he is not a fool. Don't put him upon mingling re&s;entment with his love.</P>
<P>You are very &s;erious, my dear, in the fir&s;t of the two letters before me, in relation to Mr. Hickman and me; and in relation to my mamma and me. But, as to the latter, you mu&s;t not be too grave. If we are not well together at one time, we are not ill to|gether at another.&mdash;And while I am able to make my mamma &s;mile in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t angry fit &s;he ever fell into on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion (tho' &s;ometimes &s;he would not, if &s;he could help it), it is a very good &s;ign&mdash;A &s;ign that di&s;plea&s;ure can never go deep, or be la&s;ting. And then a kind word, or kind look, to her favourite Hickman, &s;ets the one in raptures, and the other in tolerable humour, at any time.</P>
<P>But your ca&s;e pains me at heart; and with all my levity, they mu&s;t <HI>both</HI> &s;ometimes partake of that pain, which mu&s;t continue as long as you are in a &s;tate of uncertainty; and e&s;pecially as I was not able to prevail for that protection for you, which would have prevented the unhappy &s;tep, the nece&s;&s;ity for which, we both, with &s;o much rea&s;on, deplore.</P>

<P>YOU tell me, my dear, that my cloaths and the little matter of money I left behind me, will not be &s;ent me.&mdash;But I will &s;till hope. It is yet early days.

&mdash;O the &s;weet indulgence! how has my heart bled, and how does it &s;till bleed for her!</P>
<P>You advi&s;e me not to depend upon a reconcilia|tion. I do not depend upon it. I cannot. But neverthele&s;s it is the wi&s;h next my heart. And as to this man, what can I do? You &s;ee, that marriage is not ab&s;olutely in my own power, if I were inclin'd to prefer it to the trial which I think I ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, he is proud and in&s;olent. Indeed he is. But can it be your opinion, that he intends to humble me down to the level of his mean pride?</P>
<P>And what mean you, my dear friend, when you &s;ay, that I mu&s;t throw off a <HI>little more of the veil?</HI>&mdash;Indeed I never knew that I wore one.

What pretence then has he, were I to be ab&s;olutely in his power, to avenge him&s;elf on me, for the faults of others; and thro' which I have &s;uffered more than he? It cannot, cannot be, that I &s;hould have cau&s;e to apprehend him to be &s;o ungene|rous, &s;o bad, a man.</P>
<P>You bid me not be concerned at the bickerings be|tween your mamma and you. Can I avoid concern, when tho&s;e bickerings are on my account?&mdash;That they are rai&s;ed by my uncle, and my other relations, &s;urely mu&s;t add to my concern.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, perhaps too critically for the &s;tate my mind is in at pre&s;ent, that the very &s;en|tences you give from your mamma, as &s;o many im|peratives, which you take ami&s;s, are very &s;evere re|flections upon your&s;elf.&mdash;For in&s;tance&mdash;<HI>You &s;hall, I tell you, Nancy,</HI> implies, that you had di&s;puted her will.&mdash;And &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And further let me ob&s;erve, with re&s;pect to what you &s;ay, that there cannot be the &s;ame rea&s;on for a prohibition of corre&s;pondence with me, as there was of mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I thought as little of bad con&s;equences from him at the time, as you can do from me: But if obedience be a duty, the breach of it is the fault, however circum&s;tances may differ. Surely there is no merit in &s;etting up our own judgments again&s;t the judgments of our parents. And if it be puni&s;hable &s;o to do, I have been &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed;

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU may believe, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, that the circum&s;tance of the noi&s;e and outcry within the garden-door, on Monday la&s;t, gave me no &s;mall un|ea&s;ine&s;s, to think that I was in the hands of a man, who could, by &s;uch vile premeditation, lay a &s;nare to trick me out of my&s;elf, as I have &s;o frequently called it.</P>
<P>Whenever he came in my &s;ight, the thought of this gave me an indignation that made his pre&s;ence di&s;|gu&s;tful to me; and the more, as I fancy'd I beheld in his face a triumph which reproached my weakne&s;s on that account; altho', perhaps, it was only the &s;ame vivacity and placidne&s;s that generally fit upon his fea|tures.</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved to ta&s;k him upon this &s;ubject, the fir&s;t time I could have patience to enter upon it with him. For, be&s;ides that it piqued me exce&s;&s;ively from the nature of the artifice, I expected &s;huffling and eva|&s;ion, if he were guilty, that would have incen&s;ed me:
<PB N="120" REF="121">
And, if not confe&s;&s;edly guilty, &s;uch un&s;atisfactory declarations, as &s;till would have kept my mind doubt|ful and unea&s;y; and would, upon every new offence that he might give me, &s;harpen my di&s;gu&s;ts to him.</P>
<P>I have had the opportunity I waited for; and will lay before you the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>He was making his court to my good opinion in very polite terms, and with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s lamenting that he had lo&s;t it; declaring, that he knew not how he had de&s;erved to do &s;o; attributing to me a preju|dice, at lea&s;t an indifference to him, that &s;eemed, to his infinite concern, hourly to increa&s;e. And he be|&s;ought me to let him know my whole mind, that he might have an opportunity either to confe&s;s his faults, and amend them, or to clear his conduct to my &s;ati&s;|faction, and thereby intitle him&s;elf to a greater &s;hare of my confidence.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd him with quickne&s;s&mdash;Then, Mr. Love|lace, I will tell you one thing with a frankne&s;s, that is, perhaps, more &s;uitable to <HI>my</HI> character, than to <HI>yours</HI> [He hoped not, he &s;aid], which gives me a very bad opinion of you, as a de&s;igning, artful man.</P>

<P>Not the lea&s;t hurt, had the man been pa&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>But had he <HI>not</HI> been pa&s;&s;ive, as you call it, what would you have done to Mr. Solmes?</P>
<P>He was loth, he &s;aid, to tell me&mdash;Yet not the lea&s;t hurt to his <HI>per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>I repeated my que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If he mu&s;t tell me, he only propo&s;ed to carry off the <HI>poor fellow,</HI> and to hide him for a month or two. And this he would have done, let what would have been the con&s;equence.</P>

<P>Love, my deare&s;t life, is ingenious. Night and day have I racked my &s;tupid brains [O Sir, thought I, not &s;tupid! 'Twere well, perhaps, if they were] to contrive methods to prevent the &s;acrifice de&s;igned to be made of you, and the mi&s;chief that mu&s;t have en&s;ued upon it: So little hold in your affections: Such unde&s;erved antipathy from your friends: So much danger of lo&s;ing you for ever from <HI>both</HI> cau&s;es&mdash;I have not had, for the whole fortnight before la&s;t Monday, half an hour's re&s;t at a time.

<P>Again I blamed my&s;elf for meeting him: And ju&s;tly; for there were many chances to one, that I had <HI>not</HI> met him. And if I had not, all his fortnight's

contrivances, as to me, would have come to nothing; and, perhaps, I might neverthele&s;s have e&s;caped Solmes.</P>
<P>Yet, had he re&s;olved to come to Harlowe-Place with his friends, and been in&s;ulted, as he certainly would have been, what mi&s;chiefs might have followed!</P>
<P>But his re&s;olution to run away with, and to hide the poor Solmes for a month or &s;o, O my dear! what a wretch have I let run away with <HI>me,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>him!</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, If he thought &s;uch enormities as the&s;e, &s;uch defiances of the laws of &s;ociety, would have pa&s;&s;ed unpuni&s;hed?</P>
<P>He had the a&s;&s;urance to &s;ay, with one of his u&s;ual gay airs, That he &s;hould by this means have di&s;ap|pointed his enemies, and &s;aved me from a forced mar|riage.

He mu&s;t have fled his country for a time at lea&s;t: And, truly, if he had been obliged to do &s;o, as all his hopes of my favour mu&s;t have been at an end, he would have had a fellow-traveller of his own &s;ex out of our family, whom I little thought of.</P>
<P>Was ever &s;uch a wretch!&mdash;To be &s;ure he meant my brother!</P>
<P>And &s;uch, Sir, &s;aid I, in high re&s;entment, are the u&s;es you make of your corrupt intelligencer&mdash;</P>

<P>All that I &s;hall further &s;ay on this head, Mr. Love|lace, is this: That as this vile double-faced wretch has probably been the cau&s;e of great mi&s;chief on both &s;ides, and &s;till continues, as you own, his wicked practices, it is but my duty to have my friends ap|prized,

He is now actually in treaty for an inn, which will do his bu&s;ine&s;s for life. I can tell you further, that he makes love to your &s;i&s;ter's Betty: And this by my advice. They will be marry'd, when he is e&s;tabli&s;hed. An innkeeper's wife is every man's mi&s;tre&s;s; and I have a &s;cheme in my head, to &s;et &s;ome engines at work, to make her repent her &s;aucy behaviour to you to the la&s;t day of her life.</P>
<P>What a wicked &s;chemer are you, Sir!&mdash;Who &s;hall avenge upon you the &s;till greater evils which <HI>you</HI> have been guilty of?&mdash;I forgive Betty with all my heart.

<P>No matter for that, the wretch &s;aid [To be &s;ure, my dear, he mu&s;t de&s;ign to make me afraid of him] The decree was gone out&mdash;Betty mu&s;t &s;mart&mdash;Smart too by an act of her own choice.

<P>MY plaindealing with him, on &s;eeing him again, and the free di&s;like I expre&s;&s;ed to his ways, his manners, and his contrivances, as well as to his &s;peeches, have obliged him to recollect him&s;elf a little. He will have it, that the menaces which he threw out ju&s;t now again&s;t my brother and Mr. Solmes, are only the effect of an unmeaning plea&s;antry. He has too great a &s;take in his country, he &s;ays, to be guilty of &s;uch enterprizes, as &s;hould lay him under a nece&s;&s;ity of quitting it for ever.

<P>I WILL now give you the particulars of a conver|&s;ation that has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Lovelace and me; which I mu&s;t call agreeable.</P>
<P>It began with his telling me, that he had ju&s;t ri|ceived intelligence, that my friends were of a &s;udden come to a re&s;olution, to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of pur|&s;uing me, or of getting me back: And that therefore, he attended me, to know my plea&s;ure; and what <HI>I</HI> would do, or have <HI>him</HI> do?</P>
<P>I told him, that I would have him leave me di|rectly; and that, when it was known to every-body, that I was ab&s;olutely independent of him, it would pa&s;s, that I had left my father's hou&s;e, becau&s;e of my brother's ill-u&s;age of me: Which was a plea that I might make with ju&s;tice, and to the excu&s;e of my father, as well as of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He mildly reply'd, that if he could be certain, that my relations would <HI>adhere</HI> to this their new re&s;olu|tion, he could have no objection, &s;ince &s;uch was my plea&s;ure: But that, as he was well a&s;&s;ured, that they had taken it only from apprehen&s;ions, that a more <HI>active</HI> one might involve my brother (who had breath'd nothing but revenge) in &s;ome fatal misfortune, there was too much rea&s;on to believe, that they would re|&s;ume their former purpo&s;e, the moment they &s;hould think they <HI>&s;afely</HI> might.</P>
<P>This, Madam, &s;aid he, is a ri&s;que I cannot run. You would think it &s;trange, if I could. And yet, as &s;oon as I knew they had &s;o given out, I thought it proper to apprize you of it, and to take your com|mands upon it.</P>
<P>Let me hear, &s;aid I, willing to try if he had any particular view, what <HI>you</HI> think mo&s;t advi&s;eable?</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">'Tis very ea&s;y to &s;ay That, if I dur&s;t&mdash;If I might not offend you&mdash;If it were not to break conditions that &s;hall be inviolable with me.</P>
<P>Say then, Sir, what you <HI>would</HI> &s;ay. I can ap|prove or di&s;approve, as I think fit.</P>
<P>To wave, Madam, what I <HI>would</HI> &s;ay till I have more courage to &s;peak out [More courage&mdash;Mr. Lovelace more courage, my dear!]&mdash;I will only pro|po&s;e what I think will be mo&s;t agreeable to <HI>you.</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e, if you choo&s;e not to go to Lady Betty's, that you take a turn cro&s;s the country to Wind|&s;or?</P>
<P>Why to Wind&s;or?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it is a plea&s;ant place: Becau&s;e it lies in the way either to Berk&s;hire, to Oxford, or to London&mdash;<HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> where Lord M. is at pre&s;ent: <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the neighbourhood of which lives Lady Betty. <HI>Lon|don,</HI> whither you may retire at your plea&s;ure: Or, if you will <HI>have</HI> it &s;o, whither I may go, you &s;taying at Wind&s;or; and yet be within an ea&s;y di&s;tance of you, if any thing &s;hould happen, or if your friends &s;hould change their pacific re&s;olution.</P>
<P>This di&s;plea&s;ed me not. But I &s;aid, My only ob|jection was, the di&s;tance from Mi&s;s Howe, of whom I &s;hould be glad to be always within two or three hours reach by a me&s;&s;enger, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If I had thoughts of any other place than Wind&s;or, or nearer to Mi&s;s Howe, he wanted but my com|mands, and would &s;eek for proper accommodations: But, fix as I plea&s;ed, farther or nearer, he had &s;er|vants, and they had nothing el&s;e to do, but to obey me.</P>
<P>A grateful thing then he named to me&mdash;To &s;end for my Hannah, as &s;oon as I &s;hould be fixed; unle&s;s I would choo&s;e one of the young gentlewomen <HI>here</HI> to attend me, both of whom, as I had acknowleged, were very obliging; and he knew I had genero&s;ity enough to make it worth either of their whiles.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135">This of Hannah, he might &s;ee, I took very well. I &s;aid, I had thoughts of &s;ending for her, as &s;oon as I got to more convenient lodgings. As to the&s;e young gentlewomen, it were pity to break in upon that u&s;e|fulne&s;s which the whole family were of to each other: Each having her proper part, and performing it with an agreeable alacrity: In&s;omuch that I liked them all &s;o well, that I could even pa&s;s my days among them, were he to leave me; by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to me than now they were.</P>
<P>He need not repeat his objections to this place, he &s;aid: But as to going to Wind&s;or, or where-ever el&s;e I thought fit, or as to <HI>his</HI> per&s;onal attendance, or leaving me, he would a&s;&s;ure me (he very agreeably &s;aid), that I could propo&s;e nothing in which I thought my reputation, and even my <HI>punctilio,</HI> concerned, that he would not chearfully come into. And &s;ince I was &s;o much taken up with my pen, he would in&s;tantly order his hor&s;e to be got ready, and would &s;et out.</P>
<P>Not to be off of my caution, Have you any ac|quaintance at Wind&s;or? &s;aid I.&mdash;Know you of any convenient lodgings there?</P>
<P>Except with the fore&s;t, reply'd he, where I have often hunted, I know the lea&s;t of Wind&s;or, of any place &s;o noted, and &s;o plea&s;ant. Indeed, I have not a &s;ingle acquaintance there.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I told him, that I thought his propo&s;al of Wind&s;or not ami&s;s; and that I would re|move thither, if I could get a lodging only for my|&s;elf, and an upper-chamber for Hannah; for that my &s;tock of money was but &s;mall, as was ea&s;y to be con|ceived; and I &s;hould be very loth to be obliged to any-body. I added, that the &s;ooner I removed the bet|ter; for that then he could have no objection to go to London, or Berk&s;hire, as he plea&s;ed: And I &s;hould let every-body know my independence.</P>

<P>And twenty things of this &s;ort I even <HI>preach'd</HI> to him; taking care, however, not to be tedious, nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or im|patient brow.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday, April 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOU ha&s;t often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without di&s;tingui&s;hing the humorous turn that accompanies it; and for which, at the &s;ame time that thou robbe&s;t me of the merit of it, thou ad|mire&s;t me highly. <HI>Envy</HI> gives thee the <HI>indi&s;tinction: Nature</HI> in&s;pires the <HI>admiration:</HI> Unknown to thy&s;elf it in&s;pires it. But thou art too clum&s;y and too &s;hort-&s;ighted a mortal, to know how to account even for the impul&s;es by which thou thy&s;elf art moved.</P>
<P>Well, but this acquits thee not of my charge of va|nity, Lovelace, methinks thou &s;ay&s;t:</P>
<P>And true thou &s;ay&s;t: For I have indeed a con|founded parcel of it. But, if men of parts may not be allowed to be vain, who &s;hould? And yet, upon &s;econd thoughts, men of parts have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of any to be vain; &s;ince the world [&s;o few of <HI>them</HI> are there in it] are ready to find them out, and extol them. If a fool can be made &s;en&s;ible, that there is a man who has more under&s;tanding than <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he is ready enough to conclude, that &s;uch a man mu&s;t be a very extraordinary creature.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">And what, at this rate, is the general conclu&s;ion to be drawn from the promi&s;es?&mdash;Is it not, That <HI>no</HI> man ought to be vain? But what if a man can't help it?&mdash;This, perhaps, may be <HI>my</HI> ca&s;e. But there is nothing on which I value my&s;elf &s;o much as upon my <HI>inven|tions.</HI> And, for the &s;oul of me, I cannot help letting it be &s;een, that I <HI>do.</HI> Yet this vanity may be a means, perhaps, to overthrow me with this &s;agacious lady.</P>
<P>She is very apprehen&s;ive of me, I &s;ee. I have &s;tu|died before her and Mi&s;s Howe, as often as I have been with them, to pa&s;s for a giddy thoughtle&s;s fel|low. What a folly then to be &s;o <HI>expatiatingly</HI> &s;incere, in my an&s;wer to her home Put, upon the noi&s;es within the garden?&mdash;But &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s having attended that contrivance [Succe&s;s, Jack, has blown many a man up!], my cur&s;ed vanity got uppermo&s;t, and kept down my caution. The menace to have &s;ecreted Solmes, and that other, that I had thoughts to run away with her fooli&s;h brother, and of my project to revenge her upon the two &s;ervants, &s;o much terrified my beloved, that I was forced to &s;it down to mu&s;e how to retrieve my&s;elf with her.</P>
<P>Some favourable incidents, at the time, tumbled in from my agent in her family; at lea&s;t &s;uch as I was determined to <HI>make</HI> favourable: And therefore I de|&s;ired admittance; and this before &s;he could re&s;olve any thing again&s;t me; that is to &s;ay, while her ad|miration of my intrepidity kept re&s;olution in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I prepared my&s;elf to be all gentle|ne&s;s, all obligingne&s;s, all &s;erenity; and as I have now-and-then, and always <HI>had,</HI> more or le&s;s, good mo|tions pop up in my mind, I encouraged and collected every thing of this &s;ort that I had ever had from no|vicehood to maturity, [not long in recollecting, Jack!] in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with me: And who knows, thought I, if I can hold it, and proceed, but I may be able to lay a foundation
<PB N="143" REF="144">
fit to build my grand &s;cheme upon?&mdash;<HI>Love,</HI> thought I, is not <HI>naturally</HI> a doubter: <HI>Fear</HI> is: I will try to bani&s;h the latter: Nothing then but Love will remain. <HI>Credulity</HI> is the God of Love's prime mini&s;ter; and they never are a&s;under.</P>

<P>He then acquaints his friend with what pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Lady, in relation to his advices from Harlowe-Place, and to his propo&s;al about lodg|ings, pretty much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as in hers preceding.</P>
<P>When he comes to mention his propo&s;al of the Wind&s;or lodgings, thus he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>Now, Belford, can it enter into thy leaden head, what I meant by this propo&s;al?&mdash;I know it cannot. And &s;o I'll tell thee.</P>
<P>To leave her for a day or two, with a view to &s;erve her by my ab&s;ence, would, as I thought, look like confiding in her favour.&mdash;I could not think of leaving her, thou knowe&s;t, while I had rea&s;on to believe her friends would pur&s;ue us; and I began to apprehend, that &s;he would &s;u&s;pect, that I made a pretence of that intentional pur&s;uit, to keep about her, and with her. But now that they had declared again&s;t it, and that they would not receive her, if &s;he came back again [a declaration &s;he had better hear fir&s;t from me, than from Mi&s;s Howe, or any other]; what &s;hould hinder me from giving her this mark of my obedience; e&s;pe|cially as I could leave Will, who is a clever fellow, and can do any thing but write and &s;pell, and my uncle's Jonas [not as guards, to be &s;ure, but as atten|dants only]; the latter to be di&s;patch'd to me occa|&s;ionally by the former, whom I could acquaint with my motions?</P>
<P>Then I wanted to inform my&s;elf, why I had not congratulatory letters from my aunts, and from my cou&s;ins Montague; to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's e&s;cape; which letters, as they &s;hould
<PB N="144" REF="145">
be worded, might po&s;&s;ibly be made nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew, as matters proceed.</P>
<P>As to Wind&s;or, I had no de&s;ign to carry her parti|cularly thither: But &s;omewhere it was proper to name, as &s;he conde&s;cended to a&s;k my advice about it. Lon|don, I dur&s;t not; but very cautiou&s;ly; and &s;o as to make it her own option: For I mu&s;t tell thee, that there is &s;uch a perver&s;ene&s;s in the &s;ex, that, when they a&s;k your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they may oppo&s;e it; tho', had not the thing in que&s;tion been <HI>your</HI> choice, perhaps it had been <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily give rea&s;ons <HI>again&s;t</HI> Wind&s;or, after I had pretended to be there; and this would have looked the better, as it was a place of my own nomination; and &s;hewn her, that I had no fixed &s;cheme.&mdash;Never was there in woman &s;uch a &s;agacious, &s;uch an all-alive apprehen&s;ion, as in this.&mdash;Yet it is a grievous thing to an hone&s;t man to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Then, in my going or return, I can call upon Mrs. Greme. She and my beloved had a great deal of talk together. If I knew what it was about; and that <HI>Either,</HI> upon their fir&s;t acquaintance, was for bene|fiting her&s;elf by the <HI>Other,</HI> I might contrive to &s;erve them <HI>both,</HI> without hurting <HI>my&s;elf:</HI> For the&s;e are the mo&s;t prudent ways of doing friend&s;hips, and what are not followed by regrets, tho' the <HI>&s;erv-ed</HI> &s;hould prove ingrateful. Then Mrs. Greme corre&s;ponds by pen and ink with her farmer &s;i&s;ter, where we are: Some|thing may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e <HI>that</HI> way, either of a conve|nient nature, which I may pur&s;ue; or an inconve|nient, which I may avoid.</P>
<P><HI>Always be careful of back-doors,</HI> is a maxim with me in all my exploits. Whoever knows me, knows that I am no proud man. I can talk as familiarly to &s;er|vants as to principals, when I have a mind to make it worth their while to oblige me in any thing.&mdash;Then &s;ervants are but as the common &s;oldiers in an army:
<PB N="145" REF="146">
They do all the mi&s;chief; frequently without malice, and merely, good &s;ouls! for mi&s;chief-&s;ake.</P>
<P>I am mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive about Mi&s;s Howe. She has a confounded deal of wit, and wants only a &s;ubject, to &s;hew as much roguery: And &s;hould I be out-witted, with all my &s;ententious, boa&s;ting con|ceit of my own <HI>no&s;trum-monger&s;hip</HI>&mdash;[I love to plague thee, who art a pretender to accuracy, and a <HI>&s;urface-skimmer</HI> in learning, with out-of-the-way words and phra&s;es] I &s;hould certainly hang, drown, or &s;hoot my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Poor Hickman!&mdash;I pity him for the pro&s;pect he has with &s;uch a virago!&mdash;But the fellow's a fool, God wot! And now I think of it, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for complete happine&s;s in the marry'd &s;tate, that one <HI>&s;hould</HI> be a fool; an argument I once held with this very Mi&s;s Howe.&mdash;But then the fool &s;hould <HI>know</HI> that he is &s;o, el&s;e the ob&s;tinate one will di&s;ap|point the wi&s;e one.</P>
<P>But my agent Jo&s;eph has help'd me to &s;ecure this quarter.</P>

<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXV. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE;</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>BUT is it not a confounded thing, that I cannot fa&s;ten an obligation upon ths proud beauty? I have two motives, in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept money and raiment from me: One, the real plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in the accommodating the haughty maid; and to think there was &s;omething near her, and upon her, that I could call <HI>mine:</HI> The other, in order to abate her &s;everity, and humble her a little.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;ooner brings down a proud &s;pirit, than a &s;en&s;e of lying under pecuniary obligations. This has always made me &s;olicitous to avoid laying my&s;elf un|der

To be deny'd a fox-chace, for fear of breaking down a fence upon my own grounds? To be clamour'd at for repairs <HI>&s;tudied</HI> for, rather than <HI>really wanted?</HI> To be prated to by a bumkin with his hat on, and his arms folded, as if he defied your expectations of that &s;ort; his foot firmly fixed, as if upon his own ground; and you forced to take his arch leers, and &s;tupid gybes; intimating by the whole of his conduct, that he has had it in his power to ob|lige you, and, if you behave civilly, may oblige you again?&mdash;I, who think I have a right to break every man's head I pa&s;s by, if I like not his looks, to bear this!&mdash;I no more could do it, than I could borrow of an in&s;olent uncle, or inqui&s;itive aunt, who would thence think them&s;elves intitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before them for their review and cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>My charmer, I &s;ee, has a pride like my own: But &s;he has no <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> in her pride: Nor knows the pretty fool, that there is nothing nobler, nothing more delightful, than for lovers to be conferring and receiving obligations from one another. In this very farm-yard, to give thee a familiar in&s;tance, I have more than once &s;een this remark illu&s;trated. A &s;trut|ting ra&s;cal of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mi&s;tre&s;s to him, when he has found a &s;ingle barley-corn, taking it up with his bill, and letting it drop five or &s;ix times, &s;till repeating his chucking invitation: And when two or three of his fea|ther'd ladies &s;trive who &s;hall be the fir&s;t for't [O Jack! a cock is a grand-&s;ignor of a bird!], he directs the bill of the foremo&s;t to it; and, when &s;he has got the dirty

pearl, he &s;truts over her with an erected cre&s;t, and an exulting chuck&mdash;a chuck-aw-aw-w, circling round her, with dropt wings, &s;weeping the du&s;t in humble court&s;hip: While the obliged &s;he, half-&s;hy, half-willing, by her cowring tail, half-&s;tretch'd wings, yet &s;eemingly affrighted eyes, and contracted neck, lets one &s;ee, that &s;he knows the barley-corn was not all he called her for.</P>

<P>Now, Belford, can&s;t thou imagine what I meant by propo&s;ing Hannah, or one of the girls here, for her attendant? I'll give thee a month to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Thou wilt not pretend to gue&s;s, thou &s;ay'&s;t.</P>
<P>Well, then, I'll tell thee.</P>
<P>Believing &s;he would certainly propo&s;e to have that favourite wench about her, as &s;oon as &s;he was a little &s;ettled, I had cau&s;ed the girl to be inquired after, with an intent to make intere&s;t, &s;ome how or other, that a month's warning &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on by her ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, or by &s;ome other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent her coming to her. But fortune fights for me. The wench is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic di&s;order, which has obliged her to leave her place, confines her to her chamber: Poor Hannah! How I pity the girl! The&s;e things are very hard upon indu&s;trious &s;ervants!&mdash;I intend to make the poor maid a &s;mall pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion&mdash;I know it will oblige my charmer.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Jack, pretending not to know any thing of the matter, I pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;end for the wench. She knew I had always a regard for this &s;ervant, be|cau&s;e of her hone&s;t love to her lady: But <HI>now</HI> I have a greater regard for her than ever. Calamity, tho' a poor &s;ervant's calamity, will rather increa&s;e than di|mini&s;h

good-will, with a truly generous ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to one of the young Sorlings's attendance, there was nothing at all in propo&s;ing that; for if either of them had been cho&s;en by <HI>her,</HI> and permitted by the <HI>mother</HI> [Two chances in <HI>that!</HI>], it would have been only till I had fix'd upon another. And if afterwards they had been loth to part, I could ea&s;ily have given my beloved a jealou&s;y, which would have done the bu&s;ine&s;s; or to the girl, who would have quitted her country dairy, &s;uch a reli&s;h for a London one, as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with Will; or perhaps I could have done &s;till better for her with Lord M.'s chaplain, who is very de&s;irous of &s;tanding well with his Lord's pre&s;umptive heir.</P>

<P>He gives an account of the &s;erious part of their con|ver&s;ation, with no great variation from the lady's account of it: And when he comes to that part of it, where he bids her remember, that reformation cannot he a &s;udden thing, he a&s;ks his friend;</P>

<P>Is not this fair play? Is it not dealing ingenuou&s;ly? Then the ob&s;ervation, I will be bold to &s;ay, is founded in truth and nature. But there was a little touch of policy in it be&s;ides; that the lady, if I &s;hould fly out again, &s;hould not think me too gro&s;s an hypocrite: For, as I plainly told her, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were <HI>but</HI> fits and &s;allies; but I hoped her example would fix them into habits. But it is &s;o di&s;couraging a thing, to have my monitre&s;s &s;o very good!&mdash;I prote&s;t I know not how to look up at her!

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. April 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THO' pretty much pre&s;&s;ed in time, and oppre&s;&s;ed by my mamma's watchfulne&s;s, I will write a few lines upon the new light that has broke in upon your gentleman; and &s;end it by a particular hand.</P>
<P>I know not what to think of him upon it.&mdash;He talks well; but judge him by Rowe's lines, he is cer|tainly a <HI>di&s;&s;embler,</HI> odious as the &s;in of hypocri&s;y, and, as he &s;ays, that other of ingratitude, are to him.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">And pray, my dear, let me a&s;k you, Could he have triumphed, as it is &s;aid he has done, over &s;o many of our &s;ex, had he not been egregiou&s;ly guilty of <HI>both</HI> &s;ins?</P>
<P>His ingenuity is the thing that &s;taggers me: Yet is he cunning enough to know, that whoever accu&s;es him&s;elf fir&s;t, blunts the edge of an adver&s;ary's accu|&s;ation.</P>
<P>He is certainly a man of &s;en&s;e: There is more hope of &s;uch a one, than of a fool: And there mu&s;t be a <HI>beginning</HI> to a reformation. The&s;e I will allow in his favour.</P>
<P>But this, I think, is the only way to judge of his &s;pecious confe&s;&s;ions and &s;elf-accu&s;ations&mdash;Does he confe&s;s any thing that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from others?&mdash;If no|thing el&s;e, what does he confe&s;s to his own di&s;advan|tage? You have heard of his duels: You have heard of his &s;eductions: All the world has.&mdash;He owns therefore what it would be to no purpo&s;e to con|ceal; and his ingenuity is a &s;alvo&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Why, this, Madam, is no more than Mr. Lovelace <HI>him&s;elf</HI> acknowleges.'</Q></P>
<P>Well, but, what is now to be done?&mdash;You mu&s;t make the be&s;t of your &s;ituation: And as you &s;ay, &s;o &s;ay I, I hope that will not be bad: For I like all that he has propo&s;ed to you of Wind&s;or, and his Canon's hou&s;e. His readine&s;s to leave you, and go him&s;elf in que&s;t of a lodging, likewi&s;e looks well.&mdash;And I think there is nothing can be &s;o properly done, as [whether you get to a Canon's hou&s;e or not] that the Canon joins you together in wedlock as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance, and of every thing you have done, but of your meeting of him. Yet, in my di&s;approba|tion of that, I judge by the event only; for who would have divined, it would have concluded as it did? But he is the devil, by his own account: And had he run
<PB N="151" REF="152">
away with the wretched Solmes, and your more wretched brother, and been him&s;elf tran&s;ported for life, he &s;hould have had my free con&s;ent for all three.</P>
<P>What u&s;e does he make of that Jo&s;eph Leman!&mdash;His ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, I mu&s;t once more &s;ay, confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive your brother, I don't know whether you ought to be angry at him on that account; yet I have wi&s;h'd fifty times, &s;ince he got you away, that you were rid of him, whether it were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before he laid you under a nece&s;&s;ity to go into mourning for him.</P>
<P>I repeat my hitherto-rejected offer. May I &s;end it &s;afely by your old man?&mdash;I have rea&s;ons for not &s;end|ing it by Hickman's &s;ervant; unle&s;s I had a bank note or notes. Inquiring for &s;uch may cau&s;e di&s;tru&s;t. My mamma is &s;o bu&s;y, &s;o inqui&s;itive!&mdash;I don't love &s;u|&s;picious tempers.</P>
<P>And here &s;he is continually in and out&mdash;I mu&s;t break off. Mr. Hickman begs his mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments to you, and offer of &s;ervices. I told him I would oblige him, becau&s;e minds in trouble take kindly any-body's civilities: But that he mu&s;t not imagine he obliged me by this; Since I &s;hould think the man or woman either blind or &s;tupid, who admired not a per&s;on of your exalted merit for her own &s;ake, and wi&s;h'd not to &s;erve her without view to other reward, than the honour of &s;erving her.</P>
<P><HI>To be &s;ure, that was his principal motive,</HI> with great daintine&s;s he &s;aid it: But with a ki&s;s of his hand, and a bow to my feet, he hoped, that that fine lady's be|ing my friend did not le&s;&s;en the merit of the reverence he really had for her.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Afternoon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Detain your me&s;&s;enger while I write in an&s;wer to yours; my poor old man not being very well.</P>
<P>You di&s;hearten me a good deal about this man. I may be too willing, from my &s;ad circum&s;tances, to think the be&s;t of him.&mdash;If his pretences to reforma|tion are but pretences, what mu&s;t be his intent? But can the heart of man be &s;o very vile? Can he, <HI>dare</HI> he, mock the Almighty?&mdash;But may I not, from one very &s;ad reflection, think better of him; That I am thrown too much in his power, to make it <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary</HI> for him (except he were to intend the very utmo&s;t villainy by me) to be &s;uch a &s;hocking hypocrite?&mdash;He mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be in earne&s;t, at the <HI>time</HI> he gives the better hopes. Surely he mu&s;t.&mdash;You your&s;elf mu&s;t join with me in this hope, or you could not wi&s;h me to be &s;o dreadfully yoked.</P>
<P>But after all, I had rather be independent of him, and of his family, altho' I have an high opinion of them; <HI>much</HI> rather: At lea&s;t till I &s;ee what my own may be brought to.&mdash;Otherwi&s;e, I think, it were be&s;t for me, at once, to ca&s;t my&s;elf into Lady Betty's protection. All would then be conducted with decency, and perhaps many mortifications would be &s;pared me. But then I mu&s;t be <HI>his,</HI> at all adven|tures, and be thought to defy my own family. And &s;hall I not &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of one application fir&s;t?&mdash;And yet I cannot make this, till I am &s;ettled &s;omewhere, and at a di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sorlings &s;hew'd me a letter this morning, which &s;he had received from her &s;i&s;ter Greme la&s;t night; in which (hoping I will forgive her forward zeal, if her &s;i&s;ter thinks fit to &s;hew her letter to me) &s;he
<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="153" REF="154">'wi&s;hes for all the noble family's &s;ake, and &s;he hopes &s;he may &s;ay for my own, that I will be plea&s;ed to yield to make his honour, as &s;he calls him, happy'</Q> She grounds her <HI>officiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as &s;he calls it, upon what he was &s;o <HI>conde&s;cending</HI> [her word al&s;o] to &s;ay to her ye&s;terday, in his way to Wind&s;or, on her <HI>pre&s;uming</HI> to a&s;k, If &s;he might &s;oon give him joy.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That no man ever loved a woman as he loved me: That no woman ever &s;o well de&s;erved to be beloved: That in every conver&s;ation, he admired me &s;till more: That he loved me with &s;uch a purity, as he had ne|ver believed him&s;elf capable of, or that a mortal creature could have in&s;pired him with; looking up|on me as all <HI>&s;oul</HI>; as an angel &s;ent down to &s;ave <HI>his</HI>;'</Q>
and a great deal more of this &s;ort:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But that he ap|prehended, my con&s;ent to make him happy was at a greater di&s;tance than he wi&s;hed.

<P>What, my dear, &s;hall I &s;ay to this?&mdash;How &s;hall I take it? Mrs. Greme is a good woman. Mrs. Sorlings is a good woman. And this letter agrees with the conver&s;ation I thought, and &s;till think, &s;o agreeable.&mdash;Yet what means the man by foregoing the opportuni|ties he has had to declare him&s;elf?&mdash;What mean his complaints of my re&s;trictions to Mrs. Greme? He is not a ba&s;hful man!&mdash;But you &s;ay, I in&s;pire people with an awe of me!&mdash;An awe, my dear!&mdash;As how?&mdash;</P>
<P>I am quite petulant at times, to find, that I am bound to &s;ee the workings of this <HI>&s;ubtle,</HI> or this <HI>giddy</HI> &s;pirit; which &s;hall I call it?</P>
<P>How am I puni&s;h'd, as I frequently think, for my vanity, in hoping to be an <HI>example</HI> to young per&s;ons of my &s;ex! Let me be but a warning, and I will now be contented. For, be my de&s;tiny what it may, I &s;hall
<PB N="154" REF="155">
never be able to hold up my head again among my be&s;t friends and worthie&s;t companions.</P>
<P>It is one of the cruelle&s;t circum&s;tances that attends the faults of the incon&s;iderate, that &s;he makes all who love her unhappy, and gives joy only to her own ene|mies, and to the enemies of her family.</P>
<P>What an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on would this afford, were it properly inculcated at the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure?</P>
<P>You know not, my dear, the worth of a virtuous man; and noble-minded as you are in mo&s;t particu|lars, you partake of the common weakne&s;s of human nature, in being apt to &s;light what is in your own power.</P>

Mr. Hickman, I fancy, would be glad to know the lady's name, who made &s;uch an ob&s;ervation. He would think it hardly po&s;&s;ible, but &s;uch a one &s;hould benefit by her own re|mark; and would be apt to wi&s;h his Mi&s;s Howe ac|quainted with her.</P>
<P>Gentlene&s;s of heart, &s;urely, is not de&s;picable in a man. Why, if it be, is the highe&s;t di&s;tinction a man can arrive at, that of a <HI>Gentleman?</HI>&mdash;A di&s;tin|ction which a prince may not de&s;erve. For manners, more than birth, fortune, or title, are requi&s;ite in this character. Manners are indeed the e&s;&s;enee of it. And &s;hall it be generally &s;aid, and Mi&s;s Howe not be an exception to it [as once you wrote <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 13.</NOTE>], that our &s;ex are be&s;t dealt with by boi&s;trous and unruly &s;pi|rits?</P>

<P>MR. Lovelace has &s;een divers apartments at Wind|&s;or; but not one, he &s;ays, that he thought fit for me, or in any manner an&s;wering my de&s;cription.</P>
<P>He had been very &s;olicitous to keep to the letter of my in&s;tructions: Which looks well: And the better I liked him, as, altho' he propo&s;ed that town, he came back, di&s;&s;uading me from it: For he &s;aid, that in his journey from thence, he had thought Wind&s;or, altho' of his own propo&s;al, a wrong choice; becau&s;e I coveted privacy, and that was a place generally vi|&s;ited and admired.</P>
<P>I told him, that if Mrs. Sorlings thought me not an incumbrance, I would be willing to &s;tay there a little longer; provided he would leave me, and go to Lord M.'s, or to London, which ever he thought be&s;t.</P>
<P>He hop'd, he &s;aid, that he might &s;uppo&s;e me ab&s;o|lutely &s;afe from the in&s;ults or attempts of my brother; and therefore, if it would make me ea&s;ier, he would obey, for a few days at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>He again propo&s;ed to &s;end for Hannah&mdash;I told him I de&s;ign'd to do &s;o, thro' you: And &s;halll beg of you, my dear, to cau&s;e the hone&s;t creature to be &s;ent to? Your faithful Robert, I think, knows where &s;he is. Perhaps &s;he will be permitted to quit her place direct|ly, by allowing a month's wages, which I will repay her.</P>
<P>He took notice of the &s;erious humour he found me in, and of the redne&s;s of my eyes: I had ju&s;t been an&s;wering your letter; and, had he not approach'd
<PB N="156" REF="157">
me, on his coming off his journey, in a very re&s;pectful manner, had he not made an unexceptionable report of his inquiries, and been &s;o ready to go from me, at the very fir&s;t word; I was prepar'd (notwith&s;tanding the good terms we parted upon when he &s;et out for Wind&s;or) to have given him a very unwelcome recep|tion: For the contents of your la&s;t letter had &s;o af|fected me, that the moment I &s;aw him, I beheld with indignation the &s;educer, who had been the cau&s;e of all the evils I &s;uffer, and have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>He hinted to me, that he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another, as I under&s;tood him, from one of the Mi&s;s Montagues. If they take notice of <HI>me</HI> in them, I wonder that he did not acquaint me with the contents. I am afraid, my dear, that his relations are among tho&s;e, who think I have taken a ra&s;h and inexcu&s;able &s;tep. It is not to my credit to let even them know, how I have been frighted out of my&s;elf: And who knows but they may hold me un|worthy of their alliance, if they may think my flight a voluntary one?&mdash;O my dear, how unea&s;y to us are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!</P>

<P>WHAT an additional concern mu&s;t I have in my reflections upon Mr. Lovelace's hatred of all my re|lations?&mdash;He calls &s;ome of them implacable; but I am afraid that he is as implacable him&s;elf, as the mo&s;t inveterate of them.</P>
<P>I could not forbear, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, to ex|pre&s;s my wi&s;hes for a reconciliation with them; and, in order to begin a treaty for that purpo&s;e, to re-urge his departure from me: He gave him&s;elf high airs up|on the occa&s;ion, not doubting, he &s;aid, that he was to be the preliminary &s;acrifice; and then he reflected in a very free manner upon my brother; nor &s;pared my father him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">So little con&s;ideration for me, my dear!&mdash;Yet it had always, as I told him, been his polite way, to treat my family with contempt; wicked creature that I was, to know it, and yet to hold corre&s;pondence with him!&mdash;</P>
<P>But let me tell you, Sir, &s;aid I, that whatever your violent temper and contempt of me, may drive you to &s;ay of my brother, I will not hear my father &s;poken ill of. It is enough, &s;urely, that I have tormented his worthy heart by my di&s;obedience; and that his once beloved child has been &s;pirited away from him.&mdash;To have his character reflected upon, by the man who has been the cau&s;e of all, is what I will not bear.</P>

<P>And then, &s;eeing me very &s;incerely angry, he begg'd my pardon, tho' not in a very humble man|ner. But, to change the &s;ubject, he took notice of the two letters he had received, one from Lady Betty Lawrance, the other from Mi&s;s Montague; and read me pa&s;&s;ages out of both.</P>
<P>Why did not the man &s;hew them to me la&s;t night? Was he afraid of giving me too much plea&s;ure?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE;</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may believe, my dear, that the&s;e letters put me in good humour with him. He &s;aw it in my countenance, and congratulated him&s;elf upon it. But yet I wonder'd that I could not have the contents of them communicated to me la&s;t night.</P>
<P>He then urged me to go directly to Lady Betty's, on the &s;trength of her letter.</P>
<P>But how, &s;aid I, can I do that, were I out of all hope of a reconciliation with my friends [which yet, however improbable to be brought about, is my duty to attempt] as her lady&s;hip has given me no particular invitation?</P>
<P>That, he was &s;ure, was owing to her doubt that it would be accepted: El&s;e &s;he had done it with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in the world.</P>
<P>That doubt it&s;elf, I &s;aid, was enough to deter me: Since her lady&s;hip, who knew &s;o well the boundaries of the fit and the unfit, by her not expecting I would accept of an invitation, had &s;he given it, would have rea&s;on to think me very forward, if I <HI>had</HI> accepted it;
<PB N="160" REF="161">
and much more forward to go without it. Then, &s;aid I, I thank <HI>you,</HI> Sir, I have no cloaths fit to go any-where, or to be &s;een by any-body.</P>
<P>O, I was fit to appear in the 'drawing-room, were full dre&s;s and jewels to be excu&s;ed, and &s;hould make the mo&s;t amiable [<HI>extraordinary</HI> he mu&s;t mean] figure there. He was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the elegance of my dre&s;s. By what art he knew not, but I appeared to &s;uch ad|vantage, as if I had a different &s;uit every day. Be&s;ides, his cou&s;ins Montague would &s;upply me with all I wanted for the pre&s;ent; and he would write to Mi&s;s Charlotte accordingly, if I would give him leave.</P>
<P>Do you think me the jay in the fable? &s;aid I.&mdash;Would you have me vi&s;it the owners of the borrowed dre&s;&s;es in their own cloaths?&mdash;Surely, Mr. Lovelace, you think I have either a very low, or a very con|fident mind.</P>
<P>Would I choo&s;e to go to London, for a few days only, in order to furni&s;h my&s;elf with cloaths?</P>
<P>Not at <HI>his</HI> expence. I was not prepared to wear his livery yet.</P>
<P>I could not have appeared in earne&s;t to him, in my di&s;plea&s;ure at his artful contrivances to get me away, if I were not occa&s;ionally to &s;hew my real fretfulne&s;s upon the de&s;titute condition he has reduced me to. When people &s;et out wrong together, it is very diffi|cult to avoid recriminations.</P>
<P>He wi&s;h'd he knew but my mind&mdash;That &s;hould direct him in his propo&s;als, and it would be his delight to ob&s;erve it, whatever it was.</P>
<P>My mind was, that he &s;hould leave me out of hand.&mdash;How often mu&s;t I tell him &s;o?&mdash;</P>
<P>If I were any-where but here, he would obey me, he &s;aid, if I in&s;i&s;ted upon it. But if I would a&s;&s;ert my right, that would be infinitely preferable, in his opi|nion, to any other mea&s;ure <HI>but one; which he dur&s;t only hint at:</HI> For then, admitting <HI>his</HI> vi&s;its, or refu&s;e|ing them, as I plea&s;ed [granting a corre&s;pondence by
<PB N="161" REF="162">
letter only] it would appear to all the world, that what I had done, was but in order to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>How often mu&s;t I tell you, Sir, that I will not litigate with my papa?&mdash;Do you think that my un|happy circum&s;tances will alter my notions of my own duty, &s;o far as it is practicable for me to perform it?&mdash;How can I obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without litigation, and but by my tru&s;tees? One of them will be again&s;t me; the other is abroad. This mu&s;t take up time, were I <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to fall upon this mea&s;ure.&mdash;And what I want, is pre&s;ent independence, and your <HI>immediate</HI> ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Upon his &s;oul, the wretch &s;wore, he did not think it &s;afe, for the rea&s;ons he had before given, to leave me here.&mdash;He hoped I would think of &s;ome place, to which I &s;hould like to go. But he mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that he hoped his behaviour had not been &s;o exceptionable, as to make me &s;o <HI>very</HI> earne&s;t for his ab&s;ence in the interim: And the le&s;s, &s;urely, as I was almo&s;t <HI>eternally</HI> &s;hutting up my&s;elf from him; altho' he pre&s;umed, he &s;aid, to a&s;&s;ure me, that he never went from me, but with a corrected heart, and with &s;trengthened re&s;olutions of improving by my example.</P>
<P><HI>Eternally &s;hutting my&s;elf up from you!</HI> repeated I&mdash;I hope, Sir, that you will not pretend to take it <HI>ami&s;s,</HI> that I expect to be uninvaded in my retire|ments. I hope you do not think me &s;o weak a crea|ture (novice as you have found me in a very capital in&s;tance) as to be fond of occa&s;ions to hear your fine &s;peeches, e&s;pecially as no differing circum&s;tances require your over-frequent vi&s;its; nor that I am to be addre&s;&s;ed to as if I thought hourly profe&s;&s;ions needful to a&s;&s;ure me of your honour.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed a little di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>You know, Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, why I am &s;o earne&s;t for your ab&s;ence. It is, that I may appear
<PB N="162" REF="163">
to the world independent of you; and in hopes, by that means, to find it le&s;s difficult to &s;et on foot a recon|ciliation with my friends. And now let me add (in order to make you ea&s;ier as to the terms of that hoped-for reconciliation) that &s;ince I find I have the good fortune to &s;tand &s;o well with your relations, I will, from time to time, acquaint you, by letter, when you are ab&s;ent, with every &s;tep I &s;hall take, and with every overture that &s;hall be made to me. But not with an intention to render my&s;elf accountable to you, neither, as to my acceptance or non-acceptance of tho&s;e overtures. They know, that I have a power given me by my grandfather's will, to bequeath the e&s;tate he left me, together with my &s;hare of the effects, in a way that may affect them, though not ab&s;o|lutely from them: This <HI>con&s;ideration,</HI> I hope, will pro|cure me <HI>&s;ome</HI> from them, when their pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, and they know I am independent of you.</P>
<P>Charming rea&s;oning!&mdash;And let him tell me, that the a&s;&s;urance I had given him was all he wi&s;hed-for. It was more than he could a&s;k.&mdash;What a happine&s;s to have a woman of honour and genero&s;ity to depend upon!&mdash;Had he, on his fir&s;t entrance into the world, met with &s;uch a one, he had never been other than a man of &s;trict virtue&mdash;But all, he hoped, was for the be&s;t; &s;ince, in that ca&s;e, he had never, perhaps, had the happine&s;s now in his view; becau&s;e his relations had been always urging him to marry; and that before he had the honour to know me.&mdash;And now, as he had not been &s;o bad as &s;ome peoples malice reported him to be, he hoped, he &s;hould have more merit in his repentance, than if he had never err'd.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I took it for granted, that he a&s;&s;ented to the rea&s;oning he &s;eemed to approve, and would leave me. And then I a&s;ked him, What he really, and in his mo&s;t deliberate mind, would advi&s;e me to, in my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation? He mu&s;t needs &s;ee, I &s;aid, that I was at a great lo&s;s what to re&s;olve upon; intirely a &s;tran|ger

<P>He imagines him&s;elf, I find, to be a very polite man, and cannot bear to be thought otherwi&s;e. He put up his lip,&mdash;I am &s;orry for it, Madam.&mdash;A man of breeding, a man of politene&s;s, give me leave to &s;ay, colouring, is much more of a black &s;wan with you, than with any lady I ever met with.</P>
<P>Then that is your misfortune, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine, at pre&s;ent.&mdash;Every woman of di&s;cern|ment, I am confident, knowing what I know of you now, would &s;ay as I &s;ay [I had a mind to mortify a pride, that I am &s;ure de&s;erves to be mortify'd] that your politene&s;s is not regular, nor con&s;tant. It is not habit. It is too much &s;een by fits, and &s;tarts, and &s;allies, and tho&s;e not &s;pontaneous. You mu&s;t be <HI>reminded</HI> into them.</P>
<P>O Lord! O Lord!&mdash;Poor I!&mdash;was the light, yet the half-angry wretch's &s;elf-pitying expre&s;&s;ion!&mdash;</P>
<P>I proceeded.&mdash;Upon my word, Sir, you are not the accompli&s;h'd man, which your talents and oppor|tunities would have led one to expect you to be.&mdash;You are indeed in your noviciate [He had, in a for|mer conver&s;ation, u&s;ed that word] as to every laudable attainment.&mdash;</P>

<P>I Was going on to tell him more of my mind, &s;ince the &s;ubject was introduced and treated by him &s;o lightly; but he interrupted me&mdash;Dear, dear Madam, &s;pare me, I am &s;orry that I have lived to this hour

for nothing at all. But &s;urely you could not have quitted a &s;ubject &s;o much more agreeable, and &s;o much more &s;uitable, I will &s;ay, to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, if you had not too cruel a plea&s;ure in mortifying a man, who before looked up to you with a diffidence in his own merits too great to permit him to &s;peak half his mind to you.&mdash;Be plea&s;ed but to return to the &s;ubject we were upon; and at another time I will gladly em|brace correction from the only mouth in the world &s;o qualify'd to give it.</P>
<P>You talk of reformation, &s;ometimes, Mr. Lovelace; and in &s;o talking acknowlege errors.

<P>I admire your delicacy. Madam, again interrupted he.&mdash;Altho' I &s;uffer by it, yet would I not have it otherwi&s;e: Indeed I would not, when I con&s;ider of it.

<P>And now let me mention to you different propo&s;als; in hopes that &s;ome one of them may be acceptable to you.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">I will go to Mrs. Howe, or to Mi&s;s Howe, or to whom&s;oever you would have me go, and endeavour to prevail upon them to receive you.</P>

<P>MR. Lovelace told me, that on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his propo&s;al in relation to my cou&s;in Morden might not be accepted, he had been &s;tudying to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;omewhat that might be agreeable, and which might convince me, that he preferr'd my &s;atisfaction to his own.</P>
<P>He then offered to go him&s;elf, and procure my Hannah to come and attend me: As I had declin'd the &s;ervice of either of the young Mrs. Sorlings's, he was extremely &s;olicitous, he &s;aid, that I &s;hould have a &s;ervant, in who&s;e integrity I might confide.</P>
<P>I told him, that you would be &s;o kind, as to &s;end to engage Hannah, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If any thing, he &s;aid, &s;hould prevent <HI>her</HI> from come|ing, &s;uppo&s;e he him&s;elf waited upon Mi&s;s Howe, to de&s;ire her, to lend me her &s;ervant till I was provided to my mind?</P>
<P>I &s;aid, Your mamma's high di&s;plea&s;ure at the &s;tep I had taken (as <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed, voluntarily), had deprived me of any open a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that &s;ort from you.</P>
<P>He was amazed, &s;o much as Mrs. Howe her&s;elf u&s;ed to admire me; and &s;o great an influence as Mi&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to have over her mamma (and <HI>de&s;erved</HI> to have) that that lady &s;hould take upon her&s;elf to be &s;o much offended with me. He wi&s;h'd, that the man, who took &s;uch pains to keep up and inflame the pa&s;|&s;ions of my father and uncles, were not at the bottom of this mi&s;chief too.</P>
<P>I was afraid, I &s;aid, that my brother <HI>was</HI>; or el&s;e my uncle Antony, I dared to &s;ay, would not have taken &s;uch pains to &s;et Mrs. Howe again&s;t me, as I under&s;tood he had done.</P>
<P>Since I had declined vi&s;iting his aunts, he a&s;ked me, If I would admit of a vi&s;it from his cou&s;in

Montague, and accept of a &s;ervant of hers for the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>That was not, I &s;aid, an unacceptable propo&s;al: But I would fir&s;t &s;ee, if my friends would &s;end me my cloaths, that I might not make &s;uch a giddy and run-away appearance to any of his relations.</P>
<P>If I plea&s;ed, he would make another journey to Wind&s;or, to make more particular inquiry among the canons, or in any worthy family.</P>
<P>Were not his objections as to the publicne&s;s of the place, I a&s;ked him, as &s;trong now as before?</P>
<P>I remember, my dear, in one of your former letters, you mentioned London, as the private&s;t place to be in <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>II.</HI> p. <HI>232.</HI></NOTE>: And I &s;aid, that &s;ince he made &s;uch pretences again&s;t leaving me here, as &s;hewed he had no inten|tion to do &s;o; and &s;ince he engag'd to go from me, and to leave me to pur&s;ue my own mea&s;ures, if I were el&s;ewhere; and &s;ince his pre&s;ence made the&s;e lodgings inconvenient to me, I &s;hould not be di&s;in|clined to go to London, did I know any-body there.</P>
<P>As he had &s;everal times propo&s;ed London to me, I expected, that he would eagerly have embraced that motion from me. But he took not ready hold of it: Yet I thought his eye approved of it.</P>
<P>We are both great watchers of each other's eyes; and indeed &s;eem to be more than half-afraid of each other.</P>
<P>He then made a grateful propo&s;al to me; that I would &s;end for my Mrs. Norton to attend me.</P>
<P>He &s;aw by my eyes, he &s;aid, that he had at la&s;t been happy in an expedient, which would an&s;wer both our wi&s;hes. Why, &s;ays he, did not I think of it before?&mdash;And &s;natching my hand, Shall I write, Ma|dam? Shall I &s;end? Shall I go and fetch the good woman my&s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">After a little con&s;ideration, I told him, that this was indeed a grateful motion: But that I apprehended, it would put her to a difficulty, which &s;he would not be able to get over; as it would make a woman of her known prudence appear to countenance a fugitive daughter, in oppo&s;ition to her parents: And as her coming to me would deprive her of my mamma's favour, without its being in my power to make it up to her.</P>
<P>O my beloved creature! &s;aid he, generou&s;ly enough, let not this be an ob&s;tacle. I will do every thing for the good woman you wi&s;h to have done&mdash;Let me go for her.</P>
<P>More coolly than perhaps his genero&s;ity de&s;erved, I told him, It was impo&s;&s;ible but I mu&s;t &s;oon hear from my friends. I &s;hould not, mean time, embroil any-body with them. Not Mrs. Norton e&s;pecially, from who&s;e intere&s;t in, and mediation with, my mamma, I might expect &s;ome good, were &s;he to keep her&s;elf in a neutral &s;tate: That, be&s;ides, the good woman had a mind above her fortune; and would &s;ooner want, than be beholden to any-body impro|perly.</P>

<P>Well, Madam, I can only &s;ay, I would find out &s;ome expedient, if I could, that &s;hould be agreeable to you. But &s;ince I cannot, will you be &s;o good as to tell me, what you would <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to have done? Nothing in the world but I will comply with, except|ing leaving you here, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the place I &s;hall be in, if any thing &s;hould happen; and in a place where my go&s;&s;iping ra&s;cals have made me in a manner public, for want of proper cautions at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e vermin, added he, have a pride they can hardly rein-in, when they &s;erve a man of family. They boa&s;t of their ma&s;ter's pedigree and de&s;cent, as if they were related to him. Nor is any thing they know of him, or of his affairs, a &s;ecret to one an|other, were it what would hang him.</P>
<P>If &s;o, thought I, men of family &s;hould take care to give them &s;ubjects worth boa&s;ting of.</P>
<P>I am quite at a lo&s;s, &s;aid I, what to do, or whither to go. Would you, Mr. Lovelace, in earne&s;t, ad|vi&s;e me to think of going to London?</P>
<P>And I looked at him with &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. But no|thing could I gather from his looks.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, Madam, &s;aid he, I was for propo&s;ing London, as I was then more apprehen&s;ive of pur&s;uit. But as your relations &s;eem cooler on that head, I am the more indifferent about the place you go to.&mdash;So as <HI>you</HI> are plea&s;ed&mdash;So as <HI>you</HI> are ea&s;y, I &s;hall be happy.</P>
<P>This indifference of his to London, I cannot but
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;ay, made me like going thither the better. I a&s;ked him [to hear what he would &s;ay], if he could recom|mend me to any <HI>particular place</HI> in London?</P>
<P>No, he &s;aid: None that was fit for me, or that I &s;hould like. His friend Belford indeed, had very hand&s;ome lodgings, near Soho-Square, at a relation's, a lady of virtue and honour. The&s;e, as Mr. Belford was generally in the country, he could borrow till I were better accommodated.</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved to refu&s;e the&s;e at the fir&s;t mention, as I &s;hould any other he had named. Neverthele&s;s, I will &s;ee, thought I, if he has really thoughts of the&s;e for me. If I break off the talk here, and he re&s;ume this propo&s;al with earne&s;tne&s;s in the morning, I &s;hall apprehend, that he is le&s;s indifferent than he &s;eems to be, about my going to London; and that he has al|ready a lodging in his eye for me.&mdash;And then I won't go at all.</P>
<P>But after &s;uch generous motions from him, I really think it a little barbarous to act and behave as if I thought him capable of the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t ingrate|ful ba&s;ene&s;s. But his character, his principles, are &s;o faulty!&mdash;He is &s;o light, &s;o vain, &s;o various, that there is no certainty that he will be next hour what he is This. Then, my dear, I have no guardian now; no father, no mother! Nothing but God and my vi|gilance to depend upon. And I have no rea&s;on to expect a miracle in my favour.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, ri&s;ing, to leave him, &s;omething mu&s;t be re&s;olved upon: But I will po&s;tpone this &s;ubject till to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>He would fain have engag'd me longer; but I &s;aid, I would &s;ee him as early as he plea&s;ed in the morning. He might think of any convenient place in London, or near it, mean time.</P>
<P>And &s;o I retired from him. As I do from my pen; hoping for better re&s;t for the few hours that will re|main
<PB N="171" REF="172">
for that de&s;irable refre&s;hment, than I have had of a long time.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday Morning, April 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LATE as I went to bed, I have had very little re&s;t. Sleep and I have quarrell'd; and altho' I court it, it will not be friends. I hope its Fellow-irreconcileables at Harlowe-Place, enjoy its balmy comforts. El&s;e, that will be an aggravation of my fault. My brother and &s;i&s;ter, I dare &s;ay, want it not.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, who is an early ri&s;er, as well as I, join'd me in the garden about &s;ix; and, after the u&s;ual &s;alutations, a&s;k'd me to re&s;ume our la&s;t night's &s;ubject. It was upon lodgings at London, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I think you mention'd one to me, Sir;&mdash;Did you not?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, but (watching the turn of my coun|tenance) rather as what you'd be welcome to, than perhaps approve of.</P>
<P>I believe &s;o too. To go to town upon an <HI>uncer|tainty,</HI> I own, is not agreeable; but to be oblig'd to any gentleman of your acquaintance, when I want to be thought independent of you; and to a gentleman e&s;pecially, to whom my friends are to direct to me, if they vouch&s;afe to take notice of me at all; is an ab|&s;urd thing to mention.</P>
<P>He did not mention it as what he imagin'd I would accept, but only to confirm to me what he had &s;aid, that he him&s;elf knew of none fit for me.</P>
<P>Has not your family, Madam, &s;ome one trade&s;man they deal with, who has conveniencies of this kind? I would make it worth &s;uch a per&s;on's while, to keep
<PB N="172" REF="173">
the &s;ecret of your being at his hou&s;e. Traders are dealers in pins, &s;aid he; and will be more oblig'd by a peny cu&s;tomer than a pound pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it is in their way:&mdash;Yet will refu&s;e neither.</P>
<P>My father's trade&s;men, I &s;aid, would, no doubt, be the fir&s;t employ'd to find me out: So that propo&s;al was as ab&s;urd as the other.</P>
<P>We had a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ame topic. But, at la&s;t, the re&s;ult of all was this.&mdash;He wrote a letter to one Mr. Doleman, a marry'd man of fortune and character [I excepting to Mr. Belford], de&s;iring him to provide decent apartments ready fur|ni&s;h'd [for I had told him what they &s;hould be] for a &s;ingle woman; con&s;i&s;ting of a bedchamber; another for a maid-&s;ervant, with the u&s;e of a dining-room or parlour. This he gave me to peru&s;e; and then &s;ealed it up, and di&s;patch'd it away in my pre&s;ence, by one of his own &s;ervants, who having bu&s;ine&s;s in town, is to bring back an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I attend the i&s;&s;ue of it; holding my&s;elf in readine&s;s to &s;et out for London, unle&s;s you advi&s;e the contrary. I will only add, that I am</P>

<P>HE gives, in &s;everal letters, the &s;ub&s;tance of what is contained in the la&s;t of the Lady's.</P>
<P>He tells his friend, that calling at the Lawn, in his way to M. Hall (for he owns that he went not to Wind&s;or), he found the letters from Lady Betty Lawrance, and his cou&s;in Montague, which Mrs. Greme was about &s;ending to him by a &s;pecial me&s;|&s;enger.</P>

<P>He then accounts, as follows, for the &s;erious humour he found her in, on his return.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>Upon &s;uch good terms when we parted, I was &s;ur|priz'd to find &s;o &s;olemn a brow upon my return, and her charming eyes red with weeping. But when I had under&s;tood &s;he had received letters from Mi&s;s Howe, it was ea&s;y to imagine, that that little devil had put her out of humour with me.</P>
<P>This gives me infinite curio&s;ity to find out the &s;ub|ject of their letters. But this mu&s;t not be attempted yet. An inva&s;ion in an article &s;o &s;acred, would ruin me beyond retrieve. Yet it vexes me to the heart to think, that &s;he is hourly writing her whole mind, on all that pa&s;&s;es between her and me;&mdash;I under the &s;ame roof with her;&mdash;yet kept at &s;uch awful di&s;tance, that I dare not break into a corre&s;pondence, that may per|haps be a means to blow me, and all my devices, up together!</P>
<P>Would it be very wicked, Jack, to knock her me&s;&s;enger o'the head, as he is carrying my beloved's letters, or returning with Mi&s;s Howe's? To attempt to bribe him, and not &s;ucceed, would utterly ruin me. And the man &s;eems to be one u&s;ed to poverty, oee who can &s;it down &s;atisfy'd with it, and enjoy it; contented with hand-to-mouth conveniencies, and not aiming to live better to-morrow, than he does to|day, and than he did ye&s;terday. Such a one is above temptation, unle&s;s it could come cloath'd in the gui&s;e of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>tru&s;t.</HI> What likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope, no ambition?</P>

<P>He collects the Lady's expre&s;&s;ions, which his pride cannot bear:&mdash;Such as, That he is a &s;tranger to the decorums which &s;he thought in&s;eparable from a man of birth and education; and that he is not the accompli&s;h'd man he imagines him&s;elf to be; and threatens to remember them again&s;t her.</P>
<P>He values him&s;elf upon his propo&s;als and &s;peeches, which he gives to his friend pretty much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e that the Lady does in her four la&s;t letters.</P>
<P>When he recites his endeavouring to put her upon bor|rowing a &s;ervant from Mi&s;s Howe, till Hannah could come, he writes as follows:</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t, Belford, that my charmer has no no|tion, that Mi&s;s Howe her&s;elf is but a puppet danc'd upon my wires, at &s;econd or third hand. To outwit, and impel, as one plea&s;es, two &s;uch girls as the&s;e, who think they know every thing; and, by taking ad|vantage of the pride and ill-nature of the old ones of both families, to play them off likewi&s;e, at the very time that they think they are doing me &s;piteful di&s;|plea&s;ure; what charming revenge!&mdash;Then the &s;weet Lady, when I wi&s;hed, that her <HI>brother</HI> was not at the bottom of Mrs. Howe's re&s;entment, to tell me, That
<PB N="175" REF="176">
&s;he was afraid he <HI>was,</HI> or her uncle would not have appear'd again&s;t her to that lady.&mdash;Pretty dear! how innocent!</P>
<P>But don't think me the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> neither of her family's malice and re&s;entment. It is all in their hearts. I work but with their materials. They, if left to their own wicked direction, would perhaps expre&s;s their revenge by fire and fagot; that is to &s;ay, by the pri|vate dagger, or by Lord Chief Ju&s;tices warrants, by Law, and &s;o forth: I only point the lightning, and teach it where to dart, without the thunder: In other words, I only guide the effects: The cau&s;e is in their malignant hearts: And, while I am doing a little mi&s;chief, I prevent a great deal.</P>
<P><HI>Thus he exults on her mentioning London.</HI></P>
<P>I wanted her to propo&s;e London her&s;elf. This made me again mention Wind&s;or. If you would have a woman do one thing, you mu&s;t always propo&s;e another!&mdash;The Sex! the very Sex! as I hope to be &s;aved!&mdash;Why, they lay one under a nece&s;&s;ity to deal doubly with them: And, when they find them&s;elves outwitted, they cry out upon an hone&s;t fellow, who has been too hard for them at their own weapons.</P>
<P>I could hardly contain my&s;elf. My heart was at my throat&mdash;Down, down, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, exuberant exultation!&mdash;A &s;udden cough befriended me: I again turned to her, all as <HI>indifferenced-over,</HI> as a girl at the fir&s;t long-expected que&s;tion, who waits for two more. I heard out the re&s;t of her &s;peech: And when &s;he had done, in&s;tead of &s;aying any thing of London, I pro|po&s;ed to her to &s;end for her Mrs. Norton.</P>
<P>As I knew &s;he would be afraid of lying under obli|gations, had &s;he accepted of my offer, I could have propo&s;ed to do &s;o much for the good woman and her &s;on, as would have made her re&s;olve, that I &s;hould do nothing.&mdash;This, however, not merely to avoid ex|pence: But there was no &s;uch thing as allowing of
<PB N="176" REF="177">
the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Norton. I might as well have had her mother, or aunt Hervey with her. Hannah, had &s;he been able to come, and had &s;he come, I could have done well enough with. What do I keep fel|lows idling in the country for, but to fall in love, and even to marry, whom I would have them marry?</P>
<P>How unequal is a mode&s;t woman to the adventure, when &s;he throws her&s;elf into the power of a rake!&mdash;Punctilio will, at any time, &s;tand for rea&s;ons with &s;uch a one. She cannot break thro' a well-te&s;ted mode&s;ty. None but the impudent little rogues, who can name the par&s;on and the church before you can a&s;k them for either, and undre&s;s and go to bed before you the next hour, &s;hould think of running away with a man.</P>
<P>I am in the right train now. Every hour, I doubt not, will give me an increa&s;ing intere&s;t in the af|fections of this proud beauty!&mdash;I have ju&s;t carried <HI>un</HI>-politene&s;s far enough to <HI>make her afraid of me</HI>; and to &s;hew her, that I am <HI>no whiner:</HI> Every in|&s;tance of politene&s;s, <HI>now,</HI> will give me double credit with her! My next point will be to make her ac|knowlege a <HI>lambent</HI> flame, a preference of me to all other men, at lea&s;t: And then my happy hour is not far off. An <HI>acknowleged</HI> love &s;anctifies every free|dom: And one freedom begets another. And if &s;he call me <HI>ungenerous,</HI> I can call her <HI>cruel.</HI> The &s;ex love to be called cruel. Many a time have I com|plained of cruelty, even in the act of yielding, becau&s;e I knew it gratified their pride.</P>

<P>YOU have a mo&s;t implacable family. Another vi&s;it from your uncle Antony has not only con|firm'd my mamma an enemy to our corre&s;pondence, but has almo&s;t put her upon treading in their &s;teps.</P>
<P>But, to other &s;ubjects:</P>
<P>You plead generou&s;ly for Mr. Hickman:&mdash;Perhaps, with regard to him, I may have done, as I have often done in &s;inging or mu&s;ic&mdash;Begun a note or key too high; and yet, rather than begin again, proceed, tho' I &s;train my voice, or &s;poil my tune.&mdash;But this is evi|dent, the man is more ob&s;ervant for it; and you have taught me, that the &s;pirit which is the humbler for ill-u&s;age, will be in&s;olent upon better. So, good and grave Mr. Hickman, keep your di&s;tance a little longer, I be&s;eech you. You have erected an altar to me; and I hope you will not refu&s;e to bow to it.</P>
<P>But you a&s;k me, if I would treat Mr. Lovelace, were he to be in Mr. Hickman's place, as I do Mr. Hickman?&mdash;Why really, my dear, I believe I &s;hould not.&mdash;I have been very &s;agely con&s;idering this point of behaviour, in general, on both &s;ides, in court|&s;hip; and I will very candidly tell you the re&s;ult. I have concluded, that politene&s;s, even to exce&s;s, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary on the mens part, to bring us to li&s;ten to their fir&s;t addre&s;&s;es, in order to induce us to bow our necks to a yoke &s;o unequal. But, upon my con&s;cience, I very much doubt, whether a little intermingled in&s;o|lence is not requi&s;ite from them, to keep up that in|tere&s;t, when once it has got footing. Men mu&s;t not let us &s;ee, that we can make fools of them. And, I think, that <HI>&s;mooth</HI> love, that is to &s;ay, a pa&s;&s;ion with|out
<PB N="179" REF="180">
rubs; in other words, a pa&s;&s;ion without pa&s;&s;ion, is like a &s;leepy &s;tream that is hardly &s;een to give mo|tion to a &s;traw. So that, &s;ometimes to make us fear, and even, for a &s;hort &s;pace, to <HI>hate</HI> the wretch, is productive of the <HI>contrary</HI> extreme.</P>
<P>If this be &s;o, Lovelace, than whom no man was ever more polite and ob&s;equious at the <HI>beginning,</HI> has hit the very point. For his turbulence <HI>&s;ince,</HI> his rea|dine&s;s to offend, and his equal readine&s;s to humble him&s;elf, as he is known to be a man of &s;en&s;e, and of courage too, mu&s;t keep a woman's pa&s;&s;ion alive; and at la&s;t, tire her into a non-re&s;i&s;tance, that &s;hall make her as pa&s;&s;ive as a tyrant hu&s;band would wi&s;h her to be.</P>
<P>I verily think, that the different behaviour of our two heroes to their heroines, makes out this doctrine to demon&s;tration. I am &s;o much accu&s;tom'd, for my own part, to Hickman's whining, creeping, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive court&s;hip, that I now expect nothing but whine and cringe from him; and am &s;o little moved with his non&s;en&s;e, that I am frequently forced to go to my harp&s;ichord, to keep me awake, and to &s;ilence his humdrum.&mdash;Whereas Lovelace keeps up the ball with a witne&s;s, and all his addre&s;s and conver&s;ation is one continual game at racket.</P>
<P>Your frequent quarrels and reconciliations verify this ob&s;ervation: And I really believe, that, could Hickman have kept my attention alive after the Love|lace manner, only that he had pre&s;erv'd his morals, I &s;hould have marry'd the man by this time. But then he mu&s;t have <HI>&s;et out</HI> accordingly. For now, he can never, never recover him&s;elf, that's certain; but mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dangler to the end of the court&s;hip chapter; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e for him, a pa&s;&s;ive to the end of his life.</P>
<P>Poor Hickman! perhaps you'll &s;ay. I have been called your Echo&mdash;Poor Hickman! &s;ay I.</P>
<P>You wonder, my dear, that Mr. Lovelace took
<PB N="180" REF="181">
not notice to you of his aunt's and cou&s;in's letters to him, over-night. I don't like his keeping &s;uch a ma|terial and <HI>relative</HI> circum&s;tance, as I may call it, one moment from you. By his communicating the con|tents of them to you next day, when you was angry with him, it looks as if he with-held them for occa|&s;ional pacifiers; and if &s;o, mu&s;t he not have had a forethought that he might give you <HI>cau&s;e</HI> for anger? Of all the circum&s;tances that have happen'd &s;ince you have been with him, I think I like this the lea&s;t. This alone, my dear, &s;mall as it might look to an indif|ferent eye, in mine warrants all your cautions. Yet I think, that Mrs. Greme's letter to her &s;i&s;ter Sor|lings; his repeated motions for Hannah's attendance; and for that of one of the widow Sorlings's daughters; and, above all, for that of Mrs. Norton, are agreeable counterbalances. Were it not for tho&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;hould have &s;aid a great deal more of the other. Yet the fooli&s;h man, to let you know over-night, that he <HI>had</HI> &s;uch letters!&mdash;I can't tell what to make of him.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with what the&s;e ladies write. And the more, as I have cau&s;ed them to be again &s;ounded, and find, that the whole family are as de&s;irous as ever of your alliance.</P>
<P>I think there can be no objection to your going to London. There, as in the centre, you'll be in the way of hearing from every-body, and &s;ending to any-body. And then you will put all his &s;incerity to the te&s;t, as to his promi&s;ed ab&s;ence, and &s;uch-like.</P>
<P>But really, my dear, I think you have nothing for it but marriage. You may try (that you may &s;ay you <HI>have</HI> try'd), what your relations can be brought to. But the moment they refu&s;e your propo&s;als, &s;ubmit to the yoke, and make the be&s;t of it. He will be a &s;avage indeed, if he makes you &s;peak out. Yet, it is my opinion, that you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> bend a little; for he can|not bear to be thought &s;lightly of.</P>

<P>All the world, in &s;hort, expect you to have this man. They think, that you left your father's hou&s;e for this very purpo&s;e.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day Night, April 18.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely rejoiced to hear, that we &s;hall &s;o &s;oon have you in town, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence. You will be the more welcome &s;till, if what report &s;ays, be true; which is, that you are actually marry'd to the fair Lady upon whom we have heard you make &s;uch encomiums. Mrs. Doleman, and my &s;i&s;ter, both wi&s;h you joy, if you are, and joy upon your near pro&s;pect, if you are not. I have been in town for this week pa&s;t, to get help, if I could, from my paralytic complaints, and am in a cour&s;e for them.&mdash;Which, neverthele&s;s, did not prevent me from make|ing the de&s;ired inquiries. This is the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>You may have a fir&s;t floor, well-furni&s;hed, at a mercer's in Bedford-&s;treet, Covent-garden, with what conveniencies you plea&s;e for &s;ervants: And the&s;e either by the quarter or month. The terms ac|cording to the conveniencies required.</P>
<P>Mrs. Doleman has &s;een lodgings in Norfolk-&s;treet,
<PB N="185" REF="186">
and others in Cecil-&s;treet; but tho' the pro&s;pects to the Thames, and Surry-hills, look inviting from both the&s;e &s;treets, yet I &s;uppo&s;e they are too near the city.</P>
<P>The owner of tho&s;e in Norfolk-&s;treet would have half the hou&s;e go together. It would be too much for your de&s;cription therefore: And I &s;uppo&s;e, that you will hardly, when you think fit to declare your marriage, be in lodgings.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e in Cecil-&s;treet are neat and convenient. The owner is a widow of good character; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ts, that you take them for a twelvemonth certain.</P>
<P>You may have good accommodations in Dover-&s;treet, at a widow's, the relict of an officer in the guards, who dying &s;oon after he had purcha&s;ed his commi&s;&s;ion (to which he had a good title by &s;ervice, and which co&s;t him mo&s;t part of what he had), &s;he was obliged to let lodgings.</P>
<P>This may po&s;&s;ibly be an objection. But &s;he is very careful, &s;he &s;ays, that &s;he takes no lodgers, but of figure and reputation. She rents two good hou&s;es, di&s;tant from each other, only join'd by a large hand|&s;ome pa&s;&s;age. The inner-hou&s;e is the genteele&s;t, and is very elegantly furni&s;hed; but you may have the u&s;e of a very hand&s;ome parlour in the outer-hou&s;e, if you choo&s;e to look into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>A little garden belongs to the inner-hou&s;e, in which the old gentlewoman has di&s;play'd a true female fancy, and cramm'd it with va&s;es, flower-plots, and figures, without number.</P>
<P>As the&s;e lodgings &s;eem'd to me the mo&s;t likely to plea&s;e you, I was more particular in my inquiries about them. The apartments &s;he has to let are in the inner-hou&s;e: They are a dining-room, two neat parlours, a withdrawing-room, two or three hand&s;ome bed-chambers (one with a pretty light clo&s;et in it, which looks into the little garden); all furni&s;h'd in ta&s;te.</P>
<P>A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
were the la&s;t who lived in them. They have but lately quitted them, on his being pre&s;ented to a con&s;iderable church-preferment in Ireland. The gentlewoman &s;ays, that he took the lodgings but for three months certain; but liked them and her u&s;age &s;o well, that he continued in them two years; and left them with regret, tho' on &s;o good an account. She bragg'd, that this was the way of all the lodgers &s;he ever had, who &s;taid with her four times as long as they at fir&s;t intended.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome knowlege of the colonel, who was al|ways looked upon as a man of honour. His relict I never &s;aw before. I think &s;he has a ma&s;culine air, and is a little forbidding at fir&s;t: But when I &s;aw her behaviour to two agreeable maiden gentlewomen, her hu&s;band's nieces, whom, for <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on, &s;he calls <HI>doubly</HI> hers, and heard their prai&s;es of <HI>her,</HI> I could impute her very bulk to good humour; &s;ince we &s;el|dom &s;ee your four peevi&s;h people plump. She lives very reputably, and is, as I find, aforehand in the world.</P>
<P>If the&s;e, or any other of the lodgings I have men|tioned, be not altogether to your Lady's mind, &s;he may continue in them the le&s;s while, and choo&s;e others for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The widow con&s;ents, that you &s;hould take them for a month only, and <HI>what</HI> of them you plea&s;e. The terms, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he will not fall out upon, when &s;he knows what your Lady expects, and what <HI>her</HI> &s;ervants are to do, or <HI>yours</HI> will undertake; for &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;ervants are generally wor&s;e to deal with, than their ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Lady may board or not, as &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>As we &s;uppo&s;e you marry'd, but that you have rea&s;on, from family-differences, to keep it private for the pre&s;ent, I thought it not ami&s;s to hint as much to the widow (but as uncertainty, however), and a&s;ked her, if &s;he could, in that ca&s;e, accommodate you and
<PB N="187" REF="188">
your &s;ervants, as well as the lady and hers? She &s;aid, &s;he could; and wi&s;h'd, by all means, it were to be &s;o; &s;ince the circum&s;tance of a per&s;on's being &s;ingle, if not as well recommended as this lady, was one of her u&s;ual exceptions.</P>
<P>If none of the&s;e lodgings plea&s;e, you need not doubt very hand&s;ome ones in or near Hanover-Square, Soho-Square, Golden-Square, or in &s;ome of the new &s;treets about Gro&s;venor-Square. And Mrs. Doleman, her &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, mo&s;t cordially join to offer to your good lady the be&s;t accommodations we can make for her at Uxbridge (and al&s;o for you, if you are the hap|py man we wi&s;h you to be), till &s;he fits her&s;elf more to her mind.</P>
<P>Let me add, that the lodgings at the Mercer's, tho&s;e in Cecil-&s;treet, tho&s;e at the widow's in Dover-&s;treet, any of them, may be enter'd upon at a day's warning.</P>
<P>I am, my dear Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>You will ea&s;ily gue&s;s, my dear, when you have read the letter, which lodgings I made choice of. But fir&s;t, to try him, as in &s;o material a point I thought I could not be too circum&s;pect, I &s;eemed to prefer tho&s;e in Norfolk-&s;treet, for the very rea&s;on the writer gives why he thought I would <HI>not</HI>; that is to &s;ay, for its neighbourhood to a city &s;o well-govern'd as London is &s;aid to be. Nor &s;hould I have di&s;liked a lodging in the heart of it, having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties &s;ometimes taken at the other end of the town.&mdash;Then &s;eeming to incline to the lodgings in Cecil-&s;treet&mdash;Then to the Mercer's. But he made no vi&s;ible preference: And when I a&s;ked his opinion of the widow-gentlewoman's, he &s;aid, He thought the&s;e the mo&s;t to my ta&s;te and convenience: But as he hoped, that I would think lodgings nece&s;&s;ary but for a
<PB N="188" REF="189">
very little while, he knew not which to give his vote for.</P>
<P>I then fixed upon the widow's; and he has written accordingly to Mr. Doleman, making my compli|ments to his lady and &s;i&s;ter, for their kind offer.</P>
<P>I am to have the dining-room, the bedchamber, with the light clo&s;et (of which, if I &s;tay any time at the widow's, I &s;hall make great u&s;e), and a &s;ervant's room; and we propo&s;e to &s;et out on Saturday morn|ing. As for a maid-&s;ervant, poor Hannah's illne&s;s is a great di&s;appointment to me: But, as he &s;ays, I can make the widow &s;atisfaction for one of hers, till I can get one to my mind. And you know, I want not much attendance.</P>
<P>MR. Lovelace has ju&s;t now, of his own accord, given me five guineas for poor Hannah. I &s;end them inclo&s;ed. Be &s;o good as to cau&s;e them to be convey'd to her; and to let her know from whom they came.</P>
<P>He has obliged me much by this little mark of his con&s;ideratene&s;s. Indeed I have the better opinion of him ever &s;ince he propo&s;ed her return to me.</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t now <HI>another</HI> in&s;tance of his con&s;iderate|ne&s;s. He came to me, and &s;aid, that, on &s;econd thoughts, he could not bear, that I &s;hould go up to town without &s;ome attendant, were it but for the look of the thing to the widow and her nieces, who, according to his friend's account, lived &s;o gen|teelly; and e&s;pecially as I required him to leave me &s;oon after I arrived there; and &s;o would be left alone among &s;ttrangers. He therefore thought, that I might engage Mrs. Sorlings to lend me one of her two maids, or to let one of her daughters go up with me and &s;tay till I were provided. And if the latter, the young gentlewoman, no doubt, would be glad of &s;o good an opportunity to &s;ee a little of the curio&s;ities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="189" REF="190">
the town, and would be a proper attendant to me on the &s;ame occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I told him, as I had done before, that the &s;ervants, and the two young gentlewomen, were &s;o equally u&s;eful in their way (and &s;ervants in a bu&s;y farm were &s;o little to be &s;pared), that I &s;hould be loth to take them off of their laudable employments. Nor &s;hould I think much of diver&s;ions for one while; and &s;o the le&s;s want an attendant out of doors.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, le&s;t any thing &s;hould happen, in &s;o variable a &s;ituation as mine, to overcloud my pro&s;pects (which at pre&s;ent are more promi&s;ing than ever yet they have been &s;ince I quitted Harlowe-Place), I will &s;natch the opportunity to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf</P>

<P>Thou knowe&s;t the widow; thou knowe&s;t her nieces; thou knowe&s;t the lodgings: And did&s;t thou ever read a letter more artfully couch'd, than this of Tom Doleman? Every po&s;&s;ible objection an|ticipated! Every accident provided again&s;t!&mdash;Every little of it plot proof!</P>
<P>Who could forbear &s;miling, to &s;ee my charmer, like a farcical dean and chapter, choo&s;e what was before

cho&s;en for her; and &s;agaciou&s;ly (as they go in form to prayers, that God would direct their choice) pon|dering upon the different propo&s;als, as if &s;he would make me believe, &s;he has a mind for &s;ome other? The dear &s;ly rogue looking upon me, too, with a view to di&s;cover &s;ome emotion in me, that I can tell her, lay deeper than her eye could reach, tho' it had been a &s;un-beam.</P>
<P>No confidence in me, fair-one! None at all, 'tis plain. Thou wilt not, if I were inclined to change my views, encourage me by a generous reliance on my honour!&mdash;And &s;hall it be &s;aid, that I, a ma&s;ter of arts in love, &s;hall be overmatch'd by &s;o unpracti&s;ed a novice?</P>
<P>But to &s;ee the charmer &s;o far &s;atisfy'd with my con|trivance, as to borrow my friend's letter, in order to &s;atisfy Mi&s;s Howe likewi&s;e!</P>
<P>Silly little rogues! to walk out into by-paths on the &s;trength of their own judgments!&mdash;When no|thing but <HI>experience</HI> can teach them how to di&s;appoint us, and learn them grandmother-wi&s;dom!

<P>Pho! never mind that: Either I &s;hall have a way for it, or we &s;hall thoroughly under&s;tand one another by that time; or, if we don't, &s;he'll know enough of me, not to wonder at <HI>&s;uch</HI> a peccadillo.</P>

<P>Let me alone for that too.</P>
<P>It thou further objecte&s;t, that Tom Doleman is too great a dunce to write &s;uch a letter in an&s;wer to mine;&mdash;Can&s;t thou not imagine, that, in order to &s;ave ho|ne&s;t Tom all this trouble, I, who know the town &s;o well, could &s;end him a copy of what he &s;hould write, and leave him nothing to do, but tran&s;cribe?</P>

<P>Ay, SINCLAIR, Jack!&mdash;Remember the name! SINCLAIR, I repeat. She <HI>has</HI> no other. And her features being broad, and full-blown, I will &s;uppo&s;e her to be of Highland extraction; as her hu&s;band the colonel [mind that too] was a Scot, as brave, as ho|ne&s;t.</P>
<P>I never forget the <HI>minutiae</HI> in my contrivances. In all <HI>doubtable</HI> matters the <HI>minutiae</HI> clo&s;ely attended to, and provided for, are of more &s;ervice than a thou&s;and oaths, vows, and prote&s;tations made to &s;upply the ne|glect of them, and when jealou&s;y has actually got in|to the working mind.</P>
<P>Thou would&s;t wonder if thou knewe&s;t one half of my <HI>providences.</HI> To give thee but one: I have already been &s;o good as to &s;end up a li&s;t of books to be procured for the Lady's clo&s;et, mo&s;tly at <HI>&s;econd-hand.</HI> And thou knowe&s;t, that the women there are all well read. But I will not anticipate&mdash;Be&s;ides, it looks as if I were afraid of leaving any thing to my old friend CHANCE; which has many a time been an excellent &s;econd to me; and ought not to be affronted or de&s;pi&s;ed; e&s;pe|cially by one, who has the art of making unpromi&s;ing incidents turn out in his favour.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, April 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have a piece of intelligence to give you, which concerns you much to know.</P>
<P>Your brother having been a&s;&s;ured, that you ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="193" REF="194">
not married, has taken a re&s;olution to find you out, way-lay you, and carry you off. A friend of his, a captain of a &s;hip, undertakes to get you on &s;hip|board; and to &s;ail away with you, either by Hull or Leith, in the way to one of your brother's hou&s;es.</P>
<P>They are very wicked: For in &s;pite of all your virtues, they conclude you to be <HI>ruin'd.</HI> But if they can be a&s;&s;ured, when they have you, that you are not, they will &s;ecure you, till they can bring you out Mrs. Solmes: And mean time, in order to give Mr. Love|lace full employment, they talk of a pro&s;ecution which will be &s;et up again&s;t him, for &s;ome crime or other, that they have got a notion of, which they think, if it do not co&s;t him his life, will make him fly his country.</P>
<P>This is very early news. Mi&s;s Bell told it in confi|dence, and with mighty triumph over Lovelace, to Mi&s;s Lloyd; who is at pre&s;ent her favourite; though as much your admirer as ever. Mi&s;s Lloyd, being very apprehen&s;ive of the mi&s;chief which might fol|low &s;uch an attempt, told it to me, with leave to ap|prize you privately of it&mdash;And yet neither &s;he nor I would be &s;orry, perhaps, if Lovelace were to be fairly hang'd&mdash;that is to &s;ay, if you, my dear, had no ob|jection to it. But we cannot bear, that &s;uch an ad|mirable creature &s;hould be made the tennis-ball of two violent &s;pirits&mdash;Much le&s;s, that you &s;hould be &s;eized, and expo&s;ed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels.</P>
<P>If you can engage Mr. Lovelace to keep his temper upon it, I think you &s;hould acquaint him with it; but not to mention Mi&s;s Lloyd. Perhaps his wicked agent may come at the intelligence, and reveal it to him. But I leave it to your own di&s;cretion to do as you think fit in it.&mdash;All my concern is, that this dare|ing and fooli&s;h project, if carried on, will be a means of throwing you more into his power than ever.&mdash;But as it will convince you, that there can
<PB N="194" REF="195">
be no hope of a reconciliation, I wi&s;h you were actu|ally married, let the cau&s;e for the pro&s;ecution hinted at be what it will, &s;hort of murder or a rape.</P>
<P>Your Hannah was very thankful for your kind pre&s;ent. She heaped a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings upon you for it. She has Mr. Lovelace's too, by this time.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with Mr. Hickman, I can tell you:&mdash;For he has &s;ent her two guineas by the per&s;on who carries Mr. Lovelace's five, as from an unknown hand: Nor am I, or you, to know it. The man|ner, more than the value, I am plea&s;ed with him for. But he does a great many things of this &s;ort; and is as &s;ilent as the night; for nobody knows of them, till the gratitude of the benefited will not let them be concealed. He is now-and-then my almoner, and I believe always adds to my little benefactions.</P>
<P>But his time is not come to be prai&s;ed for the&s;e things; nor does he &s;eem to want <HI>that</HI> encourage|ment.</P>
<P>The man has certainly a good mind. Nor can we expect in one man every good quality. But he is really a &s;illy fellow, my dear, to trouble his head about me, when he &s;ees how much I de&s;pi&s;e his whole &s;ex; and mu&s;t of cour&s;e make a common man look like a fool, were he not to make <HI>him&s;elf</HI> look like one, by wi&s;hing to pitch his tent &s;o oddly. Our likings, and di&s;likings, as I have often thought, are &s;eldom go|verned by prudence, or with a view to happine&s;s. The eye, my dear, the wicked eye&mdash;has &s;uch a &s;trict alliance with the heart!&mdash;And both have &s;uch enmity to the under&s;tanding!&mdash;What an unequal union, the mind and body! All the &s;en&s;es, like the family at Harlowe-place, in a confederacy again&s;t that which would animate, and give honour to the whole, were it allowed its proper precedence.</P>
<P>Permit me, I be&s;eech you, before you go to Lon|don, to &s;end you forty-eight guineas.&mdash;I mention that &s;um to oblige you, becau&s;e, by accepting back the two
<PB N="195" REF="196">
to Hannah, I will hold you indebted to me fifty.&mdash;Surely <HI>this</HI> will induce you!&mdash;You know that I can|not want the money. I told you, that I have near double that &s;um; and that the half of it is more than my mamma knows I am mi&s;tre&s;s of. With &s;o little money as you have, what can you do at &s;uch a place as London?&mdash;You don't know what occa&s;ion you may have for me&s;&s;engers, intelligence, and &s;uch-like.&mdash;If you don't oblige me, I &s;hall not think your &s;to|mach &s;o much down as you &s;ay it is; and as, in this one particular, I think it ought to be.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tate of things between my mamma and me, you know enough of her temper, not to need to be told, that &s;he never e&s;pou&s;es or re&s;ents with indiffer|ence. Yet will &s;he not remember, that I am <HI>her</HI> daughter. No, truly, I am all my <HI>papa</HI>'s <HI>girl.</HI></P>
<P>She was very &s;en&s;ible, &s;urely, of the violence of my poor papa's temper, that &s;he can &s;o long remember <HI>that,</HI> when acts of tenderne&s;s and affection &s;eem quite forgotten. Some daughters would be tempt|ed to think, that controul &s;at very heavy upon a mother, who can endeavour to exert the power &s;he has over a child; and regret, for years after death, that &s;he had not the &s;ame over a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>If this manner of expre&s;&s;ion becomes not me, of my mother, it will be &s;omewhat extenuated by the love I always bore my father, and by the reverence I &s;hall ever pay to his memory: For he was a fond fa|ther, and perhaps would have been as tender a hu&s;|band, had not my mamma and he been too much of one temper to agree.</P>
<P>The misfortune was, in &s;hort, that, when <HI>one</HI> was out of humour, the <HI>other</HI> would be &s;o too: Yet nei|ther of their tempers <HI>comparatively</HI> bad. Notwith|&s;tanding all which, I did not imagine, girl as I was, in my papa's life-time, that my mamma's part of the yoke &s;at &s;o heavy upon her neck, as &s;he gives me
<PB N="196" REF="197">
room to think it did, whenever &s;he is plea&s;ed to di&s;|claim <HI>her</HI> part of me.</P>
<P>Both parents, as I have often thought, &s;hould be very careful, if they would &s;ecure to them&s;elves the undivided love of their children, that, of all things, they &s;hould avoid &s;uch <HI>durable</HI> contentions with each other, as &s;hould di&s;tre&s;s their children in choo&s;ing their party, when they would be glad to reverence both as they ought.</P>
<P>But here is the thing: There is not a better ma|nager of her affairs in the &s;ex, than my mamma; and I believe a <HI>notable</HI> wife is more impatient of con|troul, than an <HI>indolent</HI> one. An indolent one, per|haps, thinks &s;he has &s;omewhat to <HI>compound</HI> for; while women of the other character, I &s;uppo&s;e, know too well their own &s;ignificance to think highly of that of any-body el&s;e. All mu&s;t be their own way. In one word, Becau&s;e they are <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> they will be <HI>more</HI> than u&s;eful.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, were I a man, and a man who loved my quiet, I would not have one of the&s;e managing wives on any con&s;ideration. I would make it a matter of &s;erious inquiry beforehand, whe|ther my mi&s;tre&s;s's qualifications, if I heard &s;he was notable, were <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> or <HI>feminine</HI> ones. If indeed I were an indolent &s;upine mortal, who might be in danger of becoming the property of my &s;teward, I would then perhaps choo&s;e to marry for the qualifica|tions of a &s;teward.</P>
<P>But, &s;etting my mamma out of the que&s;tion, be|cau&s;e &s;he <HI>is</HI> my mamma, have I not &s;een how Lady Hartley pranks up her&s;elf above all her &s;ex, becau&s;e &s;he knows how to manage affairs that do not <HI>belong</HI> to her &s;ex to manage? Affairs that can do no credit to her, as a woman, to under&s;tand; <HI>practically,</HI> I mean; for the <HI>theory</HI> of them may not be ami&s;s to be known.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I do not think a <HI>man-woman</HI> a pretty character at all: And, as I &s;aid, were I a
<PB N="197" REF="198">
<HI>man,</HI> I would &s;ooner choo&s;e for a dove, tho' it were fit for nothing, but, as the play &s;ays, to go tame about hou&s;e, and breed, than a wife that is &s;etting at work (my in&s;ignificant &s;elf <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> perhaps) every bu&s;y hour my never-re&s;ting &s;ervants, tho&s;e of the Stud not excepted; and who, with a be&s;om in her hand, as I may &s;ay, would be continually filling me with apprehen&s;ions, that &s;he wanted to &s;weep me out of my own hou&s;e as u&s;ele&s;s lumber.</P>
<P>Were indeed the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, like the wonderful young Lady I &s;o <HI>much</HI> and &s;o <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> admire, to know how to confine her&s;elf within her own re|&s;pectable rounds of the needle, the pen, the hou&s;e|keeper's bills, the dairy for her amu&s;ement; to &s;ee the poor fed from &s;uperfluities that <HI>would</HI> otherwi&s;e be wa&s;ted; and exert her&s;elf in all the really u&s;eful branches of dome&s;tic management; then would &s;he move in her proper &s;phere; then would &s;he render her&s;elf <HI>amiably</HI> u&s;eful, and <HI>re&s;pectably</HI> nece&s;&s;ary; then would &s;he become the <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>-wheel of the family [Whatever you think of your Anna Howe, I would not have her be the <HI>ma&s;ter</HI>-wheel]; and every-body would love her; as every-body did you, before your in&s;olent brother came back, flu&s;h'd with his unmerit|ed acquirements, and turn'd all things top&s;y-turvy.</P>
<P>If you will be inform'd of the particulars of our contention, after you have known in general, that your unhappy affair was the &s;ubject; why then, I think, I mu&s;t tell you.</P>
<P>Yet how &s;hall I?&mdash;I feel my cheek glow with mingled &s;hame and indignation&mdash;Know then, my dear&mdash;that I have been&mdash;as I may &s;ay&mdash;that I have been <HI>beaten</HI>&mdash;Indeed 'tis true.&mdash;My mamma thought fit to &s;lap my hands to get from me a &s;heet of a letter &s;he caught me writing to you; which I tore, becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould not read it, and burnt it before her face.</P>
<P>I know this will trouble you: So &s;pare your&s;elf the labour to tell me it does.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">Mr. Hickman came in pre&s;ently after. I would not &s;ee him. I am either too much a woman to be beat, or too much a child to have an humble &s;ervant.&mdash;So I told my mother. What can one oppo&s;e but &s;ullens, when it would be unpardonable &s;o much as to <HI>think</HI> of lifting up a finger!</P>
<P>In the Harlowe-&s;tyle, &s;he <HI>will</HI> be obey'd, &s;he &s;ays: And even Mr. Hickman &s;hall be forbid the hou&s;e, if he contributes to the carrying-on of a corre&s;pondence which &s;he will not &s;uffer to be continu'd.</P>
<P>Poor man! He &s;tands a whim&s;ical chance between us. But he knows he is <HI>&s;ure</HI> of my mamma; but not of me. 'Tis ea&s;y then for him to choo&s;e his party, were it not his inclination to &s;erve you, as it &s;urely <HI>is.</HI> And this makes him a merit with me, which otherwi&s;e he would not have had; notwith&s;tanding the good qualities which I have ju&s;t now acknowleged in his fa|vour. For, my dear, let my faults in other re&s;pects be what they may, I will pretend to &s;ay, that I have in my own mind tho&s;e qualities which I prai&s;ed him for. And if we are to come together, I could for that rea&s;on better di&s;pen&s;e with them in him.&mdash;So if a hu&s;band, who has a bountiful-temper'd wife, is not a niggard, nor &s;eeks to re&s;train her, but has an opinion of all &s;he does, that is enough for him: As, on the contrary, if a bountiful-temper'd hu&s;band has a frugal wife, it is be&s;t for both. For one to give, and t'other to give, except they have the prudence, and are at &s;o good an under&s;tanding with each other, as to compare notes, they may perhaps put it out of their power to be ju&s;t. Good frugal doctrine, my dear!&mdash;But this way of putting it, is middling the matter between what I have learnt of my mamma's over-prudent, and your enlarged, notions.&mdash;But from doctrine to fact.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hut my&s;elf up all that day; and what little I did eat, at alone. But at night &s;he &s;ent up Kitty, with
<PB N="199" REF="200">
a command, upon my obedience, to attend her at &s;upper.</P>
<P>I went down: But mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly in the &s;ullens. YES, and NO, were great words with me, to every thing &s;he a&s;ked of me, for a good while.</P>
<P>That behaviour, &s;he told me, &s;hould not do for her.</P>
<P>Beating &s;hould not with me, I &s;aid.</P>
<P>My bold re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he told me, had provoked her to &s;lap my hand; and &s;he was &s;orry to have been &s;o provok'd. But again in&s;i&s;ted, that I would either give up my corre&s;pondence ab&s;olutely, or let her &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not do either, I told her. It was un&s;uit|able both to my inclination and to my honour, at the in&s;tigation of ba&s;e minds, to give up a friend in di|&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She rung all the maternal changes upon the words duty, obedience, filial obligation, and &s;o-forth.</P>
<P>I told her, that a duty too rigorou&s;ly and unrea&s;on|ably exacted, had been your ruin, if you were ruin'd. If I were of age to be marry'd, I hop'd &s;he would think me capable of <HI>making,</HI> or at lea&s;t of <HI>keeping,</HI> my own friend&s;hips; &s;uch a one e&s;pecially as this, with a young Lady, who&s;e friend&s;hip &s;he her&s;elf, till this di&s;tre&s;sful point of time, had thought the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful and edifying, that I ever had contracted.</P>
<P>The greater the merit, the wor&s;e the action: The finer the talents, the more dangerous the example.</P>
<P>There were other duties, I &s;aid, be&s;ides that of a child to a parent; and I hoped I need not give up a &s;uffering friend, e&s;pecially at the in&s;tigation of tho&s;e by whom &s;he &s;uffered. I told her, that it was very hard to annex &s;uch a condition as that to my duty; when I was per&s;uaded, that both duties might be performed, without derogating from either: That an unrea&s;onable command [She mu&s;t excu&s;e me, I mu&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="201">
&s;ay it, tho' I were &s;lapt again] was a degree of ty|ranny: And I could not have expected, that at the&s;e years I &s;hould be allow'd no will, no choice of my own; where a woman only was concern'd, and the devili&s;h &s;ex not in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>What turn'd mo&s;t in favour of her argument was, that I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from letting her read all that pa&s;&s;es between us. She in&s;i&s;ted much upon this: And &s;ince, &s;he &s;aid, you were in the hands of the mo&s;t intriguing man in the world; and a man, who had made a je&s;t of her favourite Hickman, as &s;he has been told; &s;he knows not what con&s;equences, un|thought of by you or me, may flow from &s;uch a cor|re&s;pondence.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, my dear, that I fare the wor&s;e on Mr. Hickman's account! My mamma <HI>might</HI> &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es between us, did I not know, that it would cramp your &s;pirit, and re&s;train the freedom of your pen, as it would al&s;o the freedom of my own: And were &s;he not moreover &s;o firmly attached to the con|trary &s;ide, that inferences, con&s;equences, &s;trained de|ductions, cen&s;ures, and con&s;tructions the mo&s;t partial, would for ever be hawled in to teaze me, and would perpetually &s;ubject us to the nece&s;&s;ity of debating and canva&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I don't choo&s;e that &s;he &s;hould know how much this artful wretch has outwitted, as I may call it, a lady &s;o much his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The genero&s;ity of your heart, and the greatne&s;s of your mind (a mind above &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations) full well I know; but do not offer to di&s;&s;uade me from this corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, immediately on the contention above, offer'd his &s;ervice; and I accepted of it, as you'll &s;ee by my la&s;t. He thinks, tho' he has all ho|nour for my mamma, that &s;he is unkind to us both. He was plea&s;ed to tell me (with an air, as I thought), that he not only <HI>approved</HI> of our corre&s;pondence, but
<PB N="201" REF="202">
admires the &s;teadine&s;s of my friend&s;hip; and having no opinion of your man, but a great one of me, thinks that my advice or intelligence, from time to time, may be of u&s;e to you; and, on this pre&s;umption, &s;aid, that it would be a thou&s;and pities, that you &s;hould &s;uffer for want of either.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman plea&s;ed me in the main by his &s;peech; and it is well the general tenor of it was agreeable:&mdash;Otherwi&s;e, I can tell him, I &s;hould have reckon'd with him for his word <HI>approve</HI>; for it is a &s;tile I have not yet permitted him to talk to me in:&mdash;And you &s;ee, my dear, what the&s;e men are:&mdash;No &s;ooner do they find that you have favour'd them with the power of doing you an agreeable &s;ervice, but they take upon them to <HI>approve,</HI> for&s;ooth, of your actions!&mdash;By which is imply'd a right to <HI>di&s;approve,</HI> if they think fit.</P>
<P>I have told my mamma, how much you wi&s;h to be reconciled to your relations, and how independent you are on Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>Mark the end of the latter a&s;&s;ertion, &s;he &s;ays.&mdash;And as to reconciliation, &s;he knows, nothing will do, and will have it, that nothing <HI>ought</HI> to do, but your re|turning back, without pre&s;uming to condition with them. And this if you do, &s;he &s;ays, will be&s;t &s;hew your independence on Lovelace.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, what your duty is, in my mam|ma's opinion.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e your next directed to Mr. Hickman, at his own hou&s;e, will be from London.</P>
<P>Heaven pre&s;erve you in honour and &s;afety, is my prayer.</P>
<P>What you do for change of cloaths, I cannot ima|gine.</P>
<P>It is amazing to me, what your relations can mean by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing you as they &s;eem re&s;olved to do. I &s;ee they will throw you into his arms, whether you will or not.</P>
<P>I &s;end this by Robert, for di&s;patch-&s;ake: And can

only repeat the hitherto rejected offer of my be&s;t &s;er|vices! Adieu, my deare&s;t friend. Believe me ever</P>

<P>I Should think my&s;elf utterly unworthy of your friend&s;hip, did my own concerns, heavy as they are, &s;o ingro&s;s me, that I could not find lei&s;ure for a few lines, to declare to my beloved friend my &s;incere di&s;approbation of her conduct, in an in&s;tance where &s;he is &s;o <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> faulty, that the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that very genero&s;ity may hide from her the fault, which I, more than any other, have rea&s;on to deplore, as being the unhappy occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>You know, you &s;ay, that your account of the con|tentions between your mamma and you will trouble me; and &s;o you bid me &s;pare my&s;elf the labour to tell you that they do.</P>
<P>You did not u&s;e, my dear, to forbid me thus <HI>before|hand.</HI> You was wont to &s;ay, you loved me the bet|ter for my expo&s;tulations with you on that acknow|leged warmth and quickne&s;s of your temper, which your own good &s;en&s;e taught you to be apprehen&s;ive of. What tho' I have &s;o mi&s;erably fallen, and am un|happy; if ever I had any judgment worth regard|ing, it is now as much worth as ever, becau&s;e I can give it as freely again&s;t my&s;elf, as again&s;t any-body el&s;e. And &s;hall I not, when there &s;eems to be an in|fection in my fault, and that it leads you likewi&s;e to re&s;olve to carry on a corre&s;pondence again&s;t prohibi|tion, expo&s;tulate with you upon it; when whatever con&s;equences flow from your di&s;obedience, but widen my error, which is as the evil root, from which &s;uch bad branches &s;pring?</P>

<P>Your acknowleged &s;ullens; your tearing from your mamma's hands the letter &s;he thought &s;he had a right to &s;ee; and burning it, as you own, before her face; your refu&s;al to &s;ee the man, who is &s;o willing to obey you for the &s;ake of your unhappy friend; and this purely to vex your mamma; can you think, my dear, upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give, that the&s;e faults are excu&s;able in one, who &s;o well knows her duty?</P>
<P>Your mamma had a good opinion of me once: Is not that a rea&s;on why &s;he &s;hould be more regarded now, when I have, as &s;he believes, &s;o de&s;ervedly for|feited it? A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome, as a prejudice in disfavour. In what a &s;trong light, then, mu&s;t that error appear to her, that &s;hould &s;o totally turn her heart again&s;t me, her&s;elf not a principal in the ca&s;e?</P>
<P>There are other duties, you &s;ay, be&s;ides that of a child to a parent: But That mu&s;t be a prior duty to all other duties; a duty anterior, as I may &s;ay, to your very birth: And what duty ought not to give way to That, when they come in competition?</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> are per&s;uaded, that both duties may be per|formed without derogating from either. <HI>She</HI> thinks otherwi&s;e. What is the conclu&s;ion to be drawn from the&s;e premi&s;es?</P>
<P>When your mamma &s;ees, how much <HI>I</HI> &s;uffer in
<PB N="204" REF="205">
my reputation from the &s;tep I have taken, from whom &s;he and all the world expected better things, how much rea&s;on has &s;he to be watchful over you! One evil draws another after it; and how knows &s;he, or any body, where it may &s;top?</P>
<P>Does not the per&s;on who will vindicate, or &s;eek to extenuate, a faulty &s;tep in another [In this light mu&s;t your mamma look upon the matter in que&s;tion be|tween you], give an indication either of a culpable will, or a weak judgment?&mdash;And may not &s;he ap|prehend, that the cen&s;orious will think, that &s;uch a one might probably have equally failed, under the &s;ame <HI>inducements</HI> and <HI>provocations,</HI> to <HI>u&s;e your own words</HI> in a former letter, apply'd to me?</P>
<P>Can there be a &s;tronger in&s;tance in human life than mine has &s;o early furni&s;hed within a few months pa&s;t (not to mention the uncommon provocations to it, which I have met with), of the nece&s;&s;ity of the con|tinuance of a watchful parent's care over a daughter; let that daughter have obtained ever &s;o great a reputa|tion for her prudence?</P>
<P>Is not the &s;pace from &s;ixteen to twenty-one, that which requires this care, more, than any time of a young woman's life? For in that period, do we not generally attract the eyes of the other &s;ex, and be|come the &s;ubject of their addre&s;&s;es, and not &s;eldom of their attempts? And is not That the period in which our conduct or mi&s;conduct gives us a reputation or di&s;reputation, that almo&s;t in&s;eparably accompanies us throughout our whole future lives?</P>
<P>Are we not then mo&s;t in danger from our&s;elves, becau&s;e of the di&s;tinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that &s;ex?</P>
<P>And when our dangers multiply, both from <HI>within</HI> and <HI>without,</HI> do not our parents know, that their vi|gilance ought to be doubled?&mdash;And &s;hall that nece&s;|&s;ary increa&s;e of care &s;it unea&s;y upon us, becau&s;e we are grown up to &s;tature and womanhood?</P>

<P>Is it &s;o hard for you, my dear, to be treated like a child? And can you not think it as hard, for a good parent to imagine her&s;elf under the unhappy <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;o treating her woman-grown daughter?</P>
<P>Do you think, if your mamma had been <HI>you,</HI> and you your <HI>mamma,</HI> and <HI>your</HI> daughter had &s;truggled with you, as you did with her, that you would not have been as apt, as your mamma was, to have &s;lapt your daughter's hands, to have made her quit her hold to you, and give up the prohibited paper?</P>
<P>It is a great truth, that your mamma told you, that you <HI>provoked</HI> her to this har&s;hne&s;s; and a great con|de&s;cen&s;ion in her (and not taken notice of by you, as it de&s;erv'd) to &s;ay, that &s;he was <HI>&s;orry for it.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>every</HI> age on this &s;ide matrimony (for then we come under another &s;ort of protection, tho' that is far from abrogating the filial duty), it will be found, that the wings of our parents are our mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t effectual &s;afeguard, to pre&s;erve us from the vul|turs, the hawks, the kites, and the other villainous birds of prey, that hover over us, with a view to &s;eize and de&s;troy us, the fir&s;t time we are caught wan|dering out of the eye or care of our watchful and na|tural guardians and protectors.</P>
<P>Hard as you may &s;uppo&s;e it to be deny'd the <HI>conti|nuance</HI> of a corre&s;pondence once &s;o much approved, even by the reverend denier;&mdash;Yet, if your mamma think, that my fault is of &s;uch a nature, as that a cor|re&s;pondence with me will ca&s;t a &s;hade upon your reputation; all my own friends having given me up;&mdash;that hard&s;hip is to be &s;ubmitted to. And mu&s;t it not make her the more &s;trenuous to &s;upport her own

<P>I know, my dear, you mean an humorou&s;ne&s;s in that expre&s;&s;ion, which, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, gives a delight|ful poignancy, both to your conver&s;ation and corre|&s;pondence&mdash;But indeed, my dear, <HI>this</HI> ca&s;e will not bear it.</P>
<P>Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expo|&s;tulation, that I by no means approve of &s;ome of the things you write, in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived?&mdash;at times&mdash;Only <HI>at times,</HI> I dare &s;ay; tho' perhaps, too often.&mdash;</P>
<P>Your mamma is an&s;werable to <HI>any-body,</HI> rather than to her <HI>child,</HI> for whatever was wrong in her con|duct, if any thing <HI>was</HI> wrong, towards Mr. Howe; a gentleman, of who&s;e memory I will only &s;ay, that it <HI>ought</HI> to be revered by you&mdash;But yet, &s;hould you not examine your&s;elf, whether your di&s;plea&s;ure at your mamma had no part in your revived reverence for your papa, at the time you wrote?</P>
<P>No one is perfect: And altho' your mamma may not be &s;o right to remember di&s;agreeablene&s;&s;es again&s;t the departed, yet &s;hould you not want to be reminded, on <HI>who&s;e</HI> account, and on <HI>what</HI> occa&s;ion, &s;he re|membered them.&mdash;You cannot judge, nor ought you to attempt to judge, of what might have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween both, to keep awake, and imbitter di&s;agreeable remembrances in the &s;urvivor.</P>

<P>BUT this &s;ubject mu&s;t not be pur&s;ued. Another might, with more plea&s;ure (tho' not with more approbation) upon one of your lively excur&s;ions. It is upon the high airs you give your&s;elf upon the word <HI>approve.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">How comes it about, I wonder, that a young lady &s;o noted for a predominating genero&s;ity, &s;hould not be uniformly generous?&mdash;That your genero&s;ity &s;hould fail in an in&s;tance, where policy, prudence, gratitude, would not permit it to fail? Mr. Hickman (as you confe&s;s) has indeed a worthy mind. If I had not long ago known that, he would never have found an advo|cate in me for the favour of my Anna Howe. Often and often have I been concerned, when I was your happy gue&s;t, to &s;ee him, after a conver&s;ation in which he had well-&s;upported his part in your ab&s;ence, &s;ink at once into &s;ilence the moment you came into com|pany.</P>
<P>I have told you of this before: And I believe I hinted to you once, that the &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s you put on <HI>only</HI> to him, was capable of a con&s;truction, which at the time would have very little gratify'd your pride to have had made; &s;ince it was as much in his favour, as in your own disfavour.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, my dear, is a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man. I never &s;ee a mode&s;t man, but I am &s;ure (if he has not wanted opportunities) that he has a trea&s;ure in his mind, which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it, to make him &s;hine: While a confident man, who, to <HI>be</HI> confident, mu&s;t think as meanly of his company, as highly of him&s;elf, enters with ma|gi&s;terial airs upon any &s;ubject; and depending upon his a&s;&s;urance to bring him&s;elf off when found out, talks of more than he is ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>But a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man!&mdash;O my dear, &s;hall not a mode&s;t woman di&s;tingui&s;h and wi&s;h to con&s;ort with a mode&s;t man?&mdash;A man, <HI>before</HI> whom, and <HI>to</HI> whom, &s;he may open her lips &s;ecure of his good opinion of all &s;he &s;ays, and of his ju&s;t and polite regard for her judgment? and who mu&s;t therefore in&s;pire her with an agreeable con|fidence.</P>
<P>What a lot have I drawn!&mdash;We are all apt to turn teachers.&mdash;But, &s;urely, I am better enabled to talk,
<PB N="208" REF="209">
to write, upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, than ever I was!&mdash;But I will bani&s;h <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, from an addre&s;s which, when I began to write, I was determin'd to confine wholly to your own particular.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t, deare&s;t friend, how ready are you to tell us what others &s;hould do, and even what a mother &s;hould have done! But indeed you once, I remember, advanced, that, as different attainments required dif|ferent talents to ma&s;ter them, &s;o, in the writing-way, a per&s;on might not be a bad critic upon the works of others, altho' he might him&s;elf be unable to write with excellence. But will you permit me to account for all this readine&s;s of finding fault, by placing it to human nature, which, being &s;en&s;ible of the defects of human nature (that is to &s;ay, of its <HI>own</HI> defects), loves to be <HI>correcting?</HI> But in exerci&s;ing that talent, choo&s;es rather to turn its eye <HI>outward</HI> than <HI>inward?</HI>&mdash;In other words, to employ it&s;elf rather in the <HI>out-door</HI> &s;earch, than in the <HI>in-door</HI> examination?</P>
<P>And here give me leave to add (and yet it is with tender reluctance) that altho' you &s;ay very pretty things of notable wives; and altho' I join with you in opi|nion, that hu&s;bands may have as many inconvenien|cies to encounter <HI>with,</HI> as conveniencies to boa&s;t <HI>of,</HI> from women of that character; yet Lady Hartley, perhaps, would have had milder treatment from your pen, had it not been dipt in gall, with a mother in your eye.</P>

<P>AND now, my dear, a few words, as to the pro|hibition laid upon you; a &s;ubject, that I have frequently touched upon, but cur&s;orily; becau&s;e I was afraid to tru&s;t my&s;elf with it, knowing that my judg|ment, if I did, would condemn my practice.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">You command me not to attempt to di&s;&s;uade you from this corre&s;pondence; and you tell me how kindly Mr. Hickman approves of it; and how obliging he is to me, to permit it to be carry'd on under cover to him:&mdash;But this does not quite &s;atisfy me.</P>
<P>I am a very bad ca&s;ui&s;t; and the plea&s;ure I take in writing to you, who are the only one to whom I can di&s;burden my mind, may make me, as I have hinted, very partial to my own wi&s;hes:&mdash;El&s;e, if it were not an artful eva&s;ion beneath an open and frank heart to wi&s;h to be comply'd with, I would be glad methinks to be permitted &s;till to write to you; and only have &s;uch occa&s;ional returns by Mr. Hickman's pen, as well as cover, as might &s;et me right when I am wrong; confirm me, when right; and guide me where I doubt. This would enable me to proceed in the diffi|cult path before me with more a&s;&s;uredne&s;s. For what|ever I &s;uffer from the cen&s;ures of others, if I can pre|&s;erve your good opinion, I &s;hall not be altogether un|happy, let what will befal me.</P>
<P>And indeed, my dear, I know not how to forbear writing. I have now no other employment or diver|&s;ion. And I mu&s;t write on, altho' I were not to &s;end it to any-body. You have often heard me own the advantages I have found from writing down every thing of moment that befals me; and of all I <HI>think,</HI> and of all I <HI>do,</HI> that may be of future u&s;e to me:&mdash;For, be&s;ides that this helps to form one to a &s;tyle, and opens and expands the ductile mind, every one will find, that many a good thought evaporates in thinking; many a good re&s;olution goes off, driven out of me|mory, perhaps, by &s;ome other, not &s;o good. But when I &s;et down what I <HI>will</HI> do, or what I <HI>have</HI> done, on this or that occa&s;ion; the re&s;olution or action is before me, either to be adhered to, withdrawn, or amended; and I have entered into <HI>compact</HI> with my|&s;elf, as I may &s;ay; having given it under my own
<PB N="210" REF="211">
hand, to <HI>improve</HI> rather than go <HI>backward,</HI> as I live longer.</P>
<P>I would willingly therefore write to <HI>you,</HI> if I <HI>might</HI>; the rather as it would be more in&s;piriting to have &s;ome end in view in what I write; &s;ome friend to plea&s;e; be&s;ides merely &s;eeking to gratify my pa&s;&s;ion for &s;crib|bling.</P>
<P>But why, if your mamma will permit our corre|&s;pondence on communicating to her all that pa&s;&s;es in it, and if &s;he will conde&s;cend to one only condition, may it not be comply'd with?</P>
<P>Would &s;he not, do you think, my dear, be pre|vailed upon to have the communication made to her <HI>in confidence?</HI></P>
<P>If there were any pro&s;pect of a reconciliation with my friends, I &s;hould not have &s;o much regard for my <HI>pride,</HI> as to be afraid of <HI>any-body</HI>'s knowing how much I have been <HI>outwitted,</HI> as you call it. I would in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e (when I had left Mr. Lovelace) acquaint your mamma, and all my own friends, with the whole of my &s;tory. It would behove me &s;o to do, for my own reputation, and for their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But if I have no &s;uch pro&s;pect, what will the com|munication of my reluctance to go away with Mr. Lovelace, and of his arts to frighten me away, avail me?&mdash;Your mamma has hinted, that my friends would in&s;i&s;t upon my returning to them (as a proof of the truth of my plea) to be di&s;po&s;ed of, without condition, at their plea&s;ure. If I &s;crupled this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my &s;ecret.&mdash;Mr. Lovelace, who&s;e pride already &s;o ill brooks my regrets for meeting him (when he thinks, if I had not, I mu&s;t have been Mr. Solmes's wife) would perhaps treat me with indignity:&mdash;And thus, deprived of all refuge and protection, I &s;hould become the &s;coff of men of intrigue; and be thought a greater di&s;grace than ever to my &s;ex:&mdash;Since Love, and con|&s;equential
<PB N="211" REF="212">
marriage, will find more excu&s;es, than per|haps <HI>ought</HI> to be found, for actions premeditatedly ra&s;h.</P>
<P>But if your mamma will receive the communica|tions in confidence, pray &s;hew her all that I have writ|ten, or &s;hall write. If my pa&s;t conduct de&s;erves not <HI>heavy</HI> blame, I &s;hall then perhaps have the benefit of her advice, as well as yours. And if I &s;hall wilfully de&s;erve blame for the time to come, I will be content|ed to be deny'd yours as well as hers for ever.</P>
<P>As to cramping my &s;pirit, as you call it (were I to &s;it down to write what I know your mamma mu&s;t &s;ee), that, my dear, is already cramp'd. And do not think &s;o unhand&s;omely of your mamma, as to fear that &s;he would make <HI>partial</HI> con&s;tructions again&s;t me. Neither you nor I can doubt, but that, had &s;he been left unprepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;edly to her&s;elf, &s;he would have &s;hewn favour to me. And &s;o, I dare &s;ay, would my uncle Antony.&mdash;Nay, my dear, I can extend my charity &s;till further: For I am &s;ometimes of opinion, that were my brother and &s;i&s;ter ab&s;olutely certain, that they had ruin'd me beyond recovery in the opi|nion of both my uncles, &s;o far, as that they need not be apprehen&s;ive of my cla&s;hing with their intere&s;ts; they would not oppo&s;e a pardon, altho' they might not wi&s;h a reconciliation&mdash;E&s;pecially if I would make a few &s;acrifices to them:&mdash;Which, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould be inclined to make, were I wholly free, and independent of this man.&mdash;You know I never valued my&s;elf upon worldly acqui&s;itions, nor upon my grand|father's beque&s;ts, but as they inlarged my power to do things I loved to do. And if I were deny'd the power, I mu&s;t, as I now do, curb my inclination.</P>
<P>Do not, however, think me guilty of an affectation in what I have &s;aid of my brother and &s;i&s;ter. Severe enough I am &s;ure it is, in the mo&s;t favourable &s;en&s;e. And an indifferent per&s;on will be of opinion, that they are much better warranted than ever, for the &s;ake of the
<PB N="212" REF="213">
family-honour, to &s;eek to ruin me in the favour of all my friends.</P>
<P>But to the former topic&mdash;Try, my dear, if your mamma will, upon the condition above-given, per|mit our corre&s;pondence, on &s;eeing all we write. But if &s;he will not, what a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s would there be in my love to you, were I to wi&s;h you to forego your duty for my &s;ake?</P>
<P>And now, one word, as to the freedom I have treated you with in this tedious expo&s;tulatory addre&s;s, I pre&s;ume upon your forgivene&s;s of it, becau&s;e few friend&s;hips are founded on &s;uch a ba&s;is as ours:&mdash;Which is,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'freely to <HI>give</HI> reproof, and thankfully to <HI>receive</HI> it, as occa&s;ions ari&s;e; that &s;o either may have opportunity to clear up mi&s;takes, to acknowlege and amend errors, as well in behaviour, as in words and deeds; and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each &s;hall form upon per&s;ons, things, and circum&s;tances.'</Q>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Morn, April 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY mamma will not comply with your condition, my dear. I hinted it to her, as from my&s;elf.&mdash;But the <HI>Harlowes</HI> [Excu&s;e me] have got her intirely in with them. It is a &s;cheme of mine, &s;he told me, to draw her into your party, again&s;t your parents.&mdash;Which, for her own &s;ake, &s;he is very careful about.</P>
<P>Don't be &s;o much concern'd about my mamma and me, once more, I beg of you. We &s;hall do well enough together: Now a falling-out, now a falling-in. It u&s;ed to be &s;o, when you were not in the que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>Yet do I give you my &s;incere thanks for every line of your reprehen&s;ive letters; which I intend to read as often as I find my temper ri&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215">I will freely own, that I winced a little at fir&s;t reading them. But I &s;ee, that in every reperu&s;al, I &s;hall love and honour you &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, than before.</P>
<P>Yet, I think, I have one advantage over you; and which I will hold thro' this letter, and thro' all my future letters; that is, that I will treat you as freely as you treat me; and yet will never think an apo|logy nece&s;&s;ary to you for my freedom.</P>
<P>But this is the effect of your gentlene&s;s of temper; with a little &s;ketch of imply'd reflection on the warmth of mine.&mdash;Gentlene&s;s in a woman you hold to be no fault&mdash;Nor do I, a little due or provoked warmth&mdash;But what is this, but prai&s;ing, on both &s;ides, what neither of us can help; nor perhaps wi&s;h to help? You can no more go out of your road, than I can go out of mine. It would be a pain to either to do &s;o:&mdash;What then is it in either's approving of her own natural bya&s;s, but making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity?</P>
<P>But one ob&s;ervation I will add, that were <HI>your</HI> character, and <HI>my</HI> character, to be truly drawn, mine would be allowed to be the mo&s;t natural. Shades and lights are equally nece&s;&s;ary in a fine picture.

<P>O may you not &s;uffer from a ba&s;e world for your gentlene&s;s; while my temper, by its warmth keeping all impo&s;ition at di&s;tance, tho' le&s;s amiable in general, affords me not rea&s;on, as I have mentioned heretofore, to wi&s;h to make an exchange with you!</P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed be inexcu&s;eable to open my lips by way of contradiction to my mamma, had I &s;uch a fine &s;pirit as yours to deal with&mdash;Truth is truth, my dear!&mdash;Why &s;hould narrowne&s;s run away with the prai&s;es due to a noble expan&s;ion of heart?&mdash;If every-body would &s;peak out, as I do [that is to &s;ay, give prai&s;e where only prai&s;e is due; di&s;prai&s;e where due, like|wi&s;e],

<P>I will give you an in&s;tance, neverthele&s;s, which will anew demon&s;trate, that none but very generous and noble-minded people ought to be implicitly obey'd. You know what I &s;aid above, that <HI>truth</HI> is <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>Inconveniencies will &s;ometimes ari&s;e from having to do with per&s;ons of mode&s;ty and &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s. Mr. Hickman, you &s;ay, is a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man. He put your corrective pacquet into my hand with a very fine bow, and a &s;elf-&s;atisfy'd air. [We'll con&s;ider what you &s;ay of this hone&s;t man by-and-by, my dear]. His &s;trut was not gone off, when in came my mamma, as I was reading it.</P>
<P>When &s;ome folks find their anger has made them con&s;iderable, they will be always angry, or &s;eeking occa&s;ions for anger.</P>
<P>Why, now, Mr. Hickman!&mdash;Why, now, Nancy, as I was putting the pacquet into my bo&s;om at her en|trance&mdash;You have a letter brought you this in&s;tant&mdash;While the <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man, with his pau&s;ing brayings, Mad-da&mdash;Mad-dam, looked as if he knew not whe|ther he had be&s;t to run, and leave me and my mamma to fight it out, or to &s;tand his ground, and &s;ee fair play.</P>
<P>It would have been poor to tell a lye for it.&mdash;She flung away. I went out at the oppo&s;ite door, to read it; leaving Mr. Hickman to exerci&s;e his white teeth upon his thumb-nails.</P>
<P>When I had read your letters, I went to find out my mamma. I told her the generous contents, and that you de&s;ired, that the prohibition might be ad|hered to.&mdash;I propo&s;ed your condition, as from my&s;elf; and was rejected, as above.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">She &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;he was finely painted between two young creatures, who had more wit than prudence. And in&s;tead of being prevailed upon by the genero&s;ity of your &s;entiments, made u&s;e of your opinion only to confirm her own, and renewed her prohibitions, charging me to return no other an&s;wer, but that &s;he <HI>did</HI> renew them. Adding, that they &s;hould &s;tand, till your relations were reconciled to you; hinting, as if &s;he had <HI>engaged for as much</HI>; and expected my com|pliance.</P>
<P>I thought of your reprehen&s;ions, and was <HI>meek,</HI> tho' not plea&s;ed. And let me tell you, my dear, that as long as I can &s;atisfy my own mind, that good is intended, and that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that evil &s;hould en&s;ue from our corre&s;pondence; as long as I know, that this prohibition proceeds originally from the &s;ame &s;pightful minds, which have been the occa&s;ion of all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs; as long as I know, that it is not your fault, if your relations are not reconciled to you; and that upon conditions which no rea&s;onable people would refu&s;e&mdash;You mu&s;t give me leave, with all deference to your judgment, and to your excellent le&s;&s;ons [which would reach almo&s;t every other ca&s;e of this kind, but the pre&s;ent], to in&s;i&s;t upon your writing to me, and that minutely, as if this prohibition had not been laid.</P>
<P>It is not from humour, from perver&s;ene&s;s, that I in&s;i&s;t upon this. I cannot expre&s;s how much my heart is in your concerns. And you mu&s;t, in &s;hort, allow me to think, that if I can do you &s;ervice by writing, I &s;hall be better ju&s;tify'd by <HI>continuing</HI> to write, than my mamma is by her prohibition.</P>
<P>But yet, to &s;atisfy you all I can, I will as &s;eldom return an&s;wers, while the interdict la&s;ts, as may be con&s;i&s;tent with my notions of friend&s;hip, and the &s;er|vice I owe you, and can do you.</P>
<P>As to your expedient of writing by Hickman [And now, my dear, your mode&s;t man comes in: And as
<PB N="217" REF="218">
you love mode&s;ty in that &s;ex, I will do my en|deavour, by a proper di&s;tance, to keep him in your favour] I know what you mean by it, my &s;weet friend.

As to the corre&s;pondence, THAT <HI>&s;hall</HI> go on, I do a&s;&s;ure you, be as &s;crupulous as you plea&s;e&mdash;So that <HI>that</HI> will not &s;uffer, if I do not clo&s;e with your pro|po&s;al as to him.</P>
<P>I think, I mu&s;t tell you, that it will be honour enough for him to have his name made u&s;e of &s;o fre|quently betwixt us. This, of it&s;elf, is placing a con|fidence in him, that will make him walk bolt upright, and di&s;play his white hand, and his fine diamond ring; and mo&s;t mightily lay down his &s;ervices, <HI>and</HI> his pride to oblige, <HI>and</HI> his diligence, <HI>and</HI> his fidelity, <HI>and</HI> his contrivances, to keep our &s;ecret; <HI>and</HI> his excu&s;es, <HI>and</HI> his eva&s;ions to my mamma, when challeng'd by her; with fifty <HI>and's</HI> be&s;ide. And will it not more|over give him pretence and excu&s;e oftener than ever to pad-nag it hither to good Mrs. Howe's fair daugh|ter?</P>
<P>But to admit him into my company t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te, and into my clo&s;et, as often as I would wi&s;h to write to you; I only to dictate to <HI>his</HI> pen&mdash;my mamma all the time &s;uppo&s;ing that I was going to be heartily in love with him&mdash;To make him ma&s;ter of my &s;enti|ments, and of my <HI>heart,</HI> as I may &s;ay, when I write to you&mdash;Indeed, my dear, I won't. Nor, were I married to the be&s;t HE in England, would I honour him with the communication of my corre&s;pondencies.</P>
<P>No, my dear, it is &s;ufficient, &s;urely, for him to parade it in the character of our letter-conveyer, and to be honour'd in a cover. And never fear but, mode&s;t as you think him, he will make enough of that.</P>
<P>You are always blaming me for want of genero&s;ity to this man, and for abu&s;e of power. But I profe&s;s, my dear, I cannot tell how to help it. Do, dear, now, let me &s;pread my plumes a little, and now-and-then

make my&s;elf feared. This is my time, you know, &s;ince it will be no more to <HI>my</HI> credit, than to <HI>his,</HI> to give my&s;elf tho&s;e airs when I am marry'd. He has a joy when I am plea&s;ed with him, that he would not know, but for the pain my di&s;plea&s;ure gives him.</P>
<P>This, I am &s;atisfy'd, will be the con&s;equence, if I do not make him quake now-and-then, he will en|deavour to make me fear. All the animals in the creation are more or le&s;s in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with each other. The wolf, that runs away from a lion, will devour a lamb the next moment. I remember, that I was once &s;o enraged at a game-chicken that was continually pecking at another (a poor humble one, as I thought him), that I had the offender caught, and without more ado, in a pet of humanity, wrung his neck off.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday, April 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Lovelace communicated to me this morning early, from his intelligencer, the news of my brother's &s;cheme. I like him the better for making
<PB N="219" REF="220">
very light of it; and for his treating it with contempt. And indeed, had I not had the hint of it from you, I &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected it to be &s;ome contrivance of his, in order to ha&s;ten me to town, where he has long wi&s;hed to be him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He read me the pa&s;&s;age in that Leman's letter, pretty much to the effect of what you wrote to me from Mi&s;s Lloyd; with this addition, that one Single|ton, a matter of a Scots ve&s;&s;el, is the man, who is to be the principal in this act of violence.</P>
<P>I have &s;een him. He has been twice entertained at Harlowe-Place, as my brother's friend. He has the air of a very bold and fearle&s;s man; and I fancy it mu&s;t be <HI>his</HI> project; as my brother, I &s;uppo&s;e, talks to every-body of the ra&s;h &s;tep I have taken; having not &s;pared me before he had this &s;eeming rea&s;on to cen|&s;ure me.</P>
<P>This Singleton lives at Leith; &s;o, perhaps, I am to be carried to my brother's hou&s;e not far from that port.</P>
<P>Putting the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages together, I am not a little apprehen&s;ive, that the de&s;ign, lightly as Mr. Love|lace, from his fearle&s;s temper, treats it, may be attempted to be carried into execution; and of the con&s;equences that may attend it, if it be.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked Mr. Lovelace, &s;eeing him &s;o frank and cool, what he would advi&s;e me to do?</P>
<P>Shall I a&s;k <HI>you,</HI> Madam, what are your own thoughts?&mdash;Why I return the que&s;tion, &s;aid he, is, be|cau&s;e you have been &s;o very earne&s;t that I &s;hould leave you, as &s;oon as you are in London, that I know not what to propo&s;e, without offending you.</P>
<P>My opinion is, &s;aid I, that I &s;hould &s;tudiou&s;ly con|ceal my&s;elf from the knowlege of every-body but Mi&s;s Howe; and that you &s;hould leave me out of hand; &s;ince they will certainly conclude, that where <HI>one</HI> is, the <HI>other</HI> is not far off: And it is ea&s;ier to trace <HI>you</HI> than <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">You would not &s;urely wi&s;h, &s;aid he, to fall into your brother's hands by &s;uch a violent mea&s;ure as this?&mdash;I propo&s;e not to throw my&s;elf officiou&s;ly in their way; but &s;hould they have rea&s;on to think I avoided them, would not that whet their diligence to find you, and their courage to attempt to carry you off; and &s;ub|ject me to in&s;ults that no man of &s;pirit can bear?</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me! &s;aid I, to what has this one fatal &s;tep that I have been betray'd into&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam! Let me be&s;eech you to forbear this har&s;h language, when you &s;ee, by this new &s;cheme, how determin'd they were upon carrying their old ones, had you not been <HI>betray'd,</HI> as you call it! Have I offer'd to defy the laws of &s;ociety, as this brother of yours mu&s;t do, if any thing be intended by this project?&mdash;I hope you will be plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve, that there are as violent and as wicked enter|prizers as my&s;elf&mdash;But this is &s;o very wild a project, that I think there can be no room for apprehen&s;ions from it.&mdash;I know your brother well. When at College, he had always a romantic turn. But never had a head for any thing but to puzzle and confound him&s;elf: A half invention, and a whole conceit, and without any talents to do him&s;elf good, or others harm, but as tho&s;e others gave him the power by their own folly, built upon his pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>This is very volubly run off, Sir!&mdash;But violent &s;pirits are but too much alike; at lea&s;t in their me|thods of re&s;enting. You will not pre&s;ume to make your&s;elf a le&s;s innocent man &s;urely, who had deter|min'd to brave my whole family in per&s;on, if my folly had not &s;aved <HI>you</HI> the ra&s;hne&s;s, and <HI>them</HI> the in&s;ult&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Madam!&mdash;Still mu&s;t it be <HI>folly, ra&s;hne&s;s!</HI>&mdash;It is as impo&s;&s;ible for you to think tolerably of any-body <HI>out</HI> of your own family, as it is for any one <HI>in it</HI> to de&s;erve your love!&mdash;Forgive me, deare&s;t crea|ture!&mdash;If I did not love you as no man ever loved a
<PB N="221" REF="222">
woman, I might appear more indifferent to prefer|ences &s;o unde&s;ervedly made.&mdash;But let me a&s;k you, Ma|dam, What have you borne from <HI>me</HI>?&mdash;What cau&s;e have I given you to treat me with &s;o much &s;everity, and &s;o little confidence?&mdash;And what have you not borne from <HI>them?</HI>&mdash;My general character may have been again&s;t me: But what of your own knowlege have you again&s;t me?</P>
<P>I was &s;tartled. But I was re&s;olved not to de&s;ert my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Is this a time, Mr. Lovelace, is this a proper occa|&s;ion, to give your&s;elf the&s;e high airs to me, a young creature de&s;titute of protection?&mdash;It is a &s;urprizing que&s;tion you a&s;k me. Had I aught again&s;t you of my own knowlege&mdash;I can tell you, Sir&mdash;And away I would have flung.</P>
<P>He &s;natched my hand, and be&s;ought me not to leave him in di&s;plea&s;ure.&mdash;He pleaded his pa&s;&s;ion for me, and my &s;everity to him, and partiality for tho&s;e from whom I had &s;uffer'd &s;o much; and who&s;e intended violence, he &s;aid, was now the &s;ubject of our delibe|ration.</P>
<P>I was forced to hear him.</P>
<P>You conde&s;cended, deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he, to a&s;k my advice.&mdash;It is very ea&s;y, give me leave to &s;ay, to advi&s;e you what to do. I hope I may, on this <HI>new</HI> occa&s;ion, &s;peak without offence, notwith&s;tanding your former injunctions&mdash;You &s;ee that there can be no hope of reconciliation with your relations.&mdash;Can you, Madam, con&s;ent to honour with your hand, a wretch whom you have never yet obliged with one <HI>voluntary</HI> favour?&mdash;</P>
<P>What a recriminating, what a reproachful way, my dear, was this, of putting a que&s;tion of this na|ture!&mdash;</P>
<P>I expected not from him, at the time, either the que&s;tion or the manner&mdash;I am a&s;hamed to recollect the confu&s;ion I was thrown into;&mdash;all your advice in
<PB N="222" REF="223">
my head at the moment: Yet his words &s;o prohibi|tory. He confidently &s;eemed to enjoy my confu&s;ion [Indeed, my dear, he knows not what re&s;pectful love is!]; and gaz'd upon me, as if he would have looked me through.</P>
<P>He was &s;till more declarative afterwards indeed, as I &s;hall mention by-and-by: But it was half-extorted from him.</P>
<P>My heart &s;truggled violently between re&s;entment and &s;hame to be thus teazed by one, who &s;eemed to have all <HI>his</HI> pa&s;&s;ions at command, at a time when I had very little over <HI>mine</HI>; till at la&s;t I bur&s;t into tears, and was going from him in high di&s;gu&s;t; when, throwing his arms about me, with an air, however, the mo&s;t tenderly re&s;pectful, he gave a <HI>&s;tupid</HI> turn to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It was far from his heart, he &s;aid, to take &s;o much advantage of the &s;treight, which the di&s;covery of my brother's fooli&s;h project had brought me into, as to renew, without my permi&s;&s;ion, a propo&s;al which I had hitherto di&s;countenanced; and which for that rea&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>And then he came with his half-&s;entences, apolo|gizing for what he had hardly half propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Surely, he had not the in&s;olence to <HI>intend</HI> to teaze me, to &s;ee if I could be brought to &s;peak what became me not to &s;peak&mdash;But, whether he had or not; it <HI>did</HI> teaze me; in&s;omuch that my very heart was fretted, and I broke out at la&s;t into fre&s;h tears, and a declara|tion, that I was very unhappy. And ju&s;t then recol|lecting how like a tame fool I &s;tood, with his arms about me, I flung from him with indignation. But he &s;eized my hand, as I was going out of the room, and upon his knees be&s;ought my &s;tay for one moment: And then tendered him&s;elf, in words the mo&s;t clear and explicit, to my acceptance, as the mo&s;t effectual means to di&s;appoint my brother's &s;cheme, and &s;et all right.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">But what could I &s;ay to this?&mdash;Extorted from him, as it &s;eem'd to me, rather as the effect of his compa&s;|&s;ion, than of his love? What <HI>could</HI> I &s;ay?&mdash;I pau&s;ed, I looked &s;illy! I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> I looked very &s;illy. He &s;uffered me to pau&s;e, and look &s;illy; waiting for me to &s;ay &s;omething: And at la&s;t, a&s;hamed of my confu|&s;ion, and aiming to make an excu&s;e for it, I told him, that I de&s;ired he would avoid &s;uch mea&s;ures, as might add to an unea&s;ine&s;s which was &s;o vi&s;ible upon reflect|ing on the irreconcileablene&s;s of my friends, and what unhappy con&s;equences might follow from this unac|countable project of my brother.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed to be governed by me in every thing. And again the wretch a&s;ked me, If I forgave him for the humble &s;uit he had made to me? What had I to do, but to try for a palliation of my confu&s;ion, &s;ince it &s;erv'd me not?</P>
<P>I told him, I had hopes it would not be long before Mr. Morden arrived; and doubted not, that he would be the readier to engage in my favour, when he found, that I made no other u&s;e of <HI>his,</HI> Mr. Lovelace's, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than to free my&s;elf from the addre&s;&s;es of a man &s;o di&s;agreeable to me as Mr. Solmes: I mu&s;t therefore wi&s;h, that every thing might remain as it was, till I could hear from my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>This, altho' teazed by him as I was, was not a denial, you &s;ee, my dear. But he mu&s;t throw him|&s;elf into a heat, rather than try to per&s;uade; which any other man, in his &s;ituation, I &s;hould think, would have done: And this warmth obliged me to adhere to my &s;eeming negative.</P>
<P>This was what he &s;aid, with a vehemence that mu&s;t harden any woman's mind, who had a &s;pirit above being frighted into pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s:</P>
<P>Good God!&mdash;And will you, Madam, &s;till re&s;olve to &s;hew me, that I am to hope for no &s;hare in your favour, while any the remote&s;t pro&s;pect remains, that
<PB N="224" REF="225">
you will be received by my bittere&s;t enemies, at the price of my utter rejection?</P>
<P>This was what I return'd, with warmth, and with a &s;alving art <HI>too</HI>&mdash;You have &s;een, Mr. Lovelace, how much my brother's violence can affect me: But you will be mi&s;taken, if you let loo&s;e yours upon me, with a thought of terrifying me into mea&s;ures, the contrary of which you have acquie&s;ced with.</P>
<P>He only be&s;ought me to &s;uffer his future actions to &s;peak for him; and, if I &s;aw him worthy of any fa|vour, that I would not let him be the <HI>only</HI> per&s;on within my knowlege, who was not intitled to my con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>You refer to a <HI>future time,</HI> Mr. Lovelace; &s;o do I, for the <HI>future proof</HI> of a merit you &s;eem to think for the <HI>pa&s;t time</HI> wanting: And <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> you think &s;o. And I was again going from him.</P>
<P>One word more he begged me to hear:&mdash;He was determined &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid all mi&s;chief, and every &s;tep that might lead to mi&s;chief, let my brother's proceedings, &s;hort of a violence upon my per&s;on, be what they would: But if any attempt, that &s;hould extend to that, were to be made, would I have him to be a quiet &s;pectator of my being &s;eized, or carried back, or aboard, by this Singleton; or, in ca&s;e of extremity, was he not permitted to &s;tand up in my defence?</P>
<P><HI>Stand up in my defence,</HI> Mr. Lovelace!&mdash;I &s;hould be very mi&s;erable, were there to be a call for that: But do you think I might not be <HI>&s;afe</HI> and <HI>pri|vate</HI> in London?&mdash;By your friend's de&s;cription of the widow's hou&s;e, I &s;hould think I might be &s;afe there.</P>
<P>The widow's hou&s;e, he reply'd, as de&s;cribed by his friend, being a back-hou&s;e within a front-one, and looking to a garden, rather than a &s;treet, had the appearance of privacy: But if, when there, it was not approved, it would be ea&s;y to find another more to my liking&mdash;Tho', as to his part, the method he
<PB N="225" REF="226">
would advi&s;e &s;hould be, to write to my uncle Harlowe as one of my tru&s;tees, and wait the i&s;&s;ue of it here at Mrs. Sorlings's, fearle&s;ly directing it to be an&s;wered <HI>hither.</HI> To be afraid of little &s;pirits, was but to en|courage in&s;ults, he &s;aid. The &s;ub&s;tance of the letter &s;hould be,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To demand as a right, what they would refu&s;e if reque&s;ted as a courte&s;y: To acknowlege, that I had put my&s;elf [too well, he &s;aid, did their treatment ju&s;tify me] into the protection of the <HI>Ladies</HI> of his family (by who&s;e orders, and Lord M.'s, he him&s;elf would appear to act): But that it was upon my own terms; which laid me under no obligation to <HI>them</HI> for the favour, it being no more than they would have granted to any one of my &s;ex, equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed:'</Q>
If I approved not of this me|thod, happy &s;hould he think him&s;elf, he &s;aid, if I would honour him with the opportunity of making &s;uch a claim in his <HI>own</HI> name.&mdash;But this was a point [with his <HI>buts</HI> again!] that he dur&s;t but ju&s;t touch upon. He hoped, however, that I would think their violence a &s;ufficient inducement for me to take &s;uch a wi&s;hed-for re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Inwardly vexed, I told him, That he him&s;elf had propo&s;ed to leave me when I was in town: That I expected he would: And that, when I was known to be ab&s;olutely indepdent, I &s;hould con&s;ider what to write, and what to do: But that, while he was hanging about me, I neither would nor could.</P>
<P>He would be very &s;incere with me, he &s;aid: This project of my brother's had changed the face of things.

<P>AS it was not probable, that the Lady could give &s;o particular an account of her own confu&s;ion, in the affecting &s;cene &s;he mentions on his offering him&s;elf to her acceptance; the following extracts are made from his of the above date.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>And now, Belford, what wilt thou &s;ay, if like the fly buzzing about the bright taper, I had like to have &s;indg'd the &s;ilken wings of my liberty?&mdash;Never was man in greater danger of being caught in his own &s;nares:&mdash;All his views anticipated: All his &s;chemes untry'd; and not having brought the admirable crea|ture to town; nor made an effort to know if &s;he be really angel or woman.</P>
<P>I offer'd my&s;elf to her acceptance, with a &s;udden|ne&s;s, 'tis true, that gave her no time to wrap her&s;elf in re&s;erve; and in terms <HI>le&s;s tender</HI> than <HI>fervent,</HI> tend|ing to upbraid her for her pa&s;t indifference, and re|minding her of her injunctions.&mdash;For it was her
<PB N="227" REF="228">
brother's plot, not love of me, that had inclined her to di&s;pen&s;e with them.</P>
<P>I never beheld &s;o &s;weet a confu&s;ion. What a glory to the pencil, could it do ju&s;tice to it, and to the mingled impatience which vi&s;ibly inform'd every fea|ture of the mo&s;t meaning and mo&s;t beautiful face in the world. She hemm'd twice or thrice: Her look, now &s;o charmingly &s;illy, then &s;o &s;weetly &s;ignificant; till at la&s;t, the lovely teazer, teazed by my he&s;i|tating expectation of her an&s;wer, out of all power of articulate &s;peech, bur&s;t into tears, and was turning from me, with precipitation, when, taking the liberty of folding her in my happy arms&mdash;O think not, be&s;t beloved of my heart, think not that this motion, which you may believe to be &s;o contrary to your <HI>for|mer injunctions,</HI> proceeds from a de&s;ign to avail my|&s;elf of the cruelty of your relations: If I have <HI>di&s;oblig'd</HI> you by it [and you know with what re&s;pectful tender|ne&s;s I have pre&s;umed to hint it], it &s;hall be my utmo&s;t care for the future&mdash;There I &s;topt&mdash;</P>
<P>Then &s;he &s;poke; but with vexation&mdash;I am&mdash;I am&mdash;<HI>very</HI> unhappy&mdash;Tears trickling down her crim&s;on cheeks; and her &s;weet face, as my arms &s;till incircled the fine&s;t wai&s;t in the world, &s;inking upon my &s;houlder; the dear creature &s;o ab&s;ent, that &s;he knew not the honour &s;he permitted me.</P>
<P>But why, but why unhappy, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid I?&mdash;All the gratitude that ever overflow'd the heart of the mo&s;t oblig'd of men&mdash;Ju&s;tice to my&s;elf there &s;topt my mouth; for what <HI>gratitude</HI> did I owe her for obligations &s;o involuntary?</P>
<P>Then recovering her&s;elf, and her u&s;ual re&s;erves, and &s;truggling to free her&s;elf from my cla&s;ping arms, How now. Sir! &s;aid &s;he, with a cheek more indig|nantly glowing, and eyes of a fiercer lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>I gave way to her angry &s;truggle;&mdash;but, ab&s;olutely overcome by &s;o charming a di&s;play of innocent con|fu&s;ion,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
I caught hold of her hand, as &s;he was flying from me; and, kneeling at her feet, O my angel, &s;aid I (quite de&s;titute of re&s;erve, and hardly knowing the tenor of my own &s;peech; and had a par&s;on been there, I had certainly been a gone man), receive the vows of your faithful Lovelace&mdash;Make him yours, and only yours, for ever!&mdash;This will an&s;wer every end!&mdash;Who will dare to form plots and &s;tratagems again&s;t my wife? That you are not &s;o, is the ground of all their fooli&s;h attempts, and of their in&s;olent hopes in Solmes's favour.&mdash;O be mine!&mdash;I be&s;eech you [thus on my knee I <HI>be&s;eech</HI> you] to be mine.&mdash;We &s;hall then have all the world with us: And every-body will applaud an event that every-body expects.</P>
<P>Was the devil in me!&mdash;I no more intended all this ec&s;tatic non&s;en&s;e, than I thought the &s;ame moment of flying in the air!&mdash;All power is with this charm|ing creature!&mdash;It is I, not &s;he, at this rate, that mu&s;t fail in the arduous tryal.</P>
<P>Did&s;t thou ever before hear of a man uttering &s;o|lemn things by an involuntary impul&s;e, in defiance of premeditation, and of all his own proud &s;chemes? But this &s;weet creature is able to make a man forego every purpo&s;e of his heart, that is not favourable to her.&mdash;And I verily think, I &s;hould be inclined to &s;pare her all further tryal [and yet no tryal has &s;he had], were it not for the contention that her vigi|lance has &s;et on foot, <HI>which</HI> &s;hall overcome the <HI>other.</HI> Thou knowe&s;t my genero&s;ity to my un-contending Ro&s;ebud.&mdash;And &s;ometimes do I qualify my ardent a&s;pirations after even this very fine creature, by this reflection:&mdash;That the charming'&s;t woman on earth, were &s;he an empre&s;s, can excel the meane&s;t, in the cu&s;tomary vi&s;ibles only.&mdash;Such is the equality of the di&s;pen&s;ation, to the prince and the pea&s;ant, in this prime gift, WOMAN.</P>
<P>Well, but what was the re&s;ult of this involuntary impul&s;e on my part. Would&s;t thou not think, I
<PB N="229" REF="230">
was taken at my offer?&mdash;An offer &s;o &s;olemnly made, and on one knee too?</P>
<P>No &s;uch thing!&mdash;The pretty trifler let me off as ea&s;ily as I could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Her brother's project, and to find, that there were no hopes of a reconciliation for her; and the appre|hen&s;ion &s;he had of the mi&s;chiefs that might en&s;ue&mdash;The&s;e, not <HI>my offer,</HI> nor <HI>love of me,</HI> were the cau&s;es to which &s;he a&s;cribed all her &s;weet confu&s;ion.&mdash;High-trea&s;on the <HI>a&s;cription</HI> again&s;t my &s;overeign pride&mdash;To make marriage with me, but a &s;econd-place refuge!&mdash;and as good as to tell me, that her confu&s;ion was owing to her concern, that there were no hopes, that my enemies would accept of her intended offer to re|nounce a man, who had ventured his life for her, and was &s;till ready to run the &s;ame ri&s;k in her behalf!</P>
<P>I re-urged her to make me happy&mdash;But I was to be po&s;tponed to her cou&s;in Morden's arrival. On him are now placed all her hopes.</P>
<P>I raved; but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Another letter was to be &s;ent, or had been &s;ent, to her aunt Hervey; to which &s;he hoped an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ometimes, I think, that fainter and fainter would have been her procra&s;tinations, had I been a man of courage.&mdash;But &s;o fearful was I of offending!&mdash;</P>
<P>A confounded thing! The man to be &s;o ba&s;hful; the lady to want &s;o much courting!&mdash;How &s;hall two &s;uch come together; no kind mediatre&s;s in the way?</P>
<P>But I can't help it. I mu&s;t be contented. 'Tis &s;eldom, however, that a love &s;o ardent meets with a &s;pirit &s;o re&s;igned in the &s;ame per&s;on. But true love, I am now convinced, only wi&s;hes: Nor has it any active will but that of the adorable object.</P>
<P>But, O the charming creature! again to mention London of her&s;elf!&mdash;Had Singleton's plot been of <HI>my own</HI> contriving, it could not have been a happier ex|pedient to ha&s;ten her thither; after &s;he had deferr'd
<PB N="230" REF="231">
her journey;&mdash;for what rea&s;on deferr'd it, I cannot divine.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e the letter from Jo&s;eph Leman, which I mentioned to thee in mine of Monday la&s;t <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> xxxiii. <HI>p.</HI> 177.</NOTE>, with my an&s;wer to it. I cannot re&s;i&s;t the vanity that urges me to the communication.

<P>HE acquaints Mr. Lovelace of the pro&s;ecution in|tended to be &s;et up again&s;t him, by his matters, for a Rape upon Mi&s;s Betterton, whom, by a &s;tratagem, he had got into his hands; and who afterwards died in child-bed; the child &s;till living, but, as Jo&s;eph &s;ays, not regarded by his Honour <HI>in the lea&s;t.</HI> His ma&s;ters, he &s;ays, call it a very vile affair; but God forbid that he &s;hould, without his Honour's leave.

<P>He de&s;ires him to let him know, if his Honour's life is in danger from this pro&s;ecution; and hopes, if it be,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that he will not be hanged like as a common man; but only have his head cut off, or &s;o; and that he will <HI>nathele&s;s</HI> think of his faithful Jo&s;eph Le|man, before his head &s;hall be condemned, becau&s;e afterwards he under&s;tands, that all will be the king's, or the <HI>&s;hreeve's.</HI>'</Q></P>

<P>HE tells him, That the affair of Mi&s;s Betterton was a youthful frolick: That there was no Rape in the ca&s;e:&mdash;That he went not abroad on her ac|count: That &s;he loved him, and he loved her: Yet that &s;he was but a trade&s;man's daughter; the father grown rich, and aiming at a new line of gentry: That he never pretended marriage to her: That indeed they would have had her join to pro&s;ecute him: And that &s;he owed her death to her friends barbarity, becau&s;e &s;he would <HI>not.</HI> The boy, he &s;ays, is a fine boy; no father need to be a&s;hamed of him: That he had twice, unknown to the aunt who had the care of him, been to &s;ee him; and would have
<PB N="233" REF="234">
provided for him, had there been occa&s;ion. But that the whole family were fond of the child, tho' they were &s;o wicked as to cur&s;e the father.</P>
<P>The&s;e, he &s;ays, were his rules in all his amours:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To &s;hun common women: To marry off a for|mer mi&s;tre&s;s, before he took a new one: To &s;et the mother above want, if her friends were cruel: To maintain a lady hand&s;omely in her lying-in: To provide for the little one, according to the mother's degree: And to go in mourning for her, if &s;he dy'd in childbed:'</Q>
&mdash;He challenges Jo&s;eph to find out a man of more honour than him&s;elf in the&s;e re|&s;pects. No wonder, he tells him, that the women love him as they do.</P>
<P>There is no room to fear for either his head or his neck, he tells him, from this affair:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no proce&s;s begun in her life-time; her&s;elf refu&s;ing to pro&s;ecute: Pretty circum&s;tances, Jo&s;eph, to found an indictment for a Rape upon!&mdash;Again, I &s;ay, I loved her: She was taken from me by her brutal friends while our joys were young.&mdash;But enough of dear Mi&s;s Betterton.&mdash;Dear, I &s;ay&mdash;For death indears!&mdash;Re&s;t to her worthy &s;oul!&mdash;There, Jo&s;eph, off went a deep &s;igh to the memory of Mi&s;s Betterton!'</Q></P>
<P>He encourages him in his je&s;ting&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Je&s;ting, &s;ays he, better becomes a poor man than qualms. All we &s;ay, all we do, all we wi&s;h for, is a je&s;t: He that makes it not &s;o, is a &s;ad fellow, and has the wor&s;t of it.&mdash;Whoever grudges a poor man joy, ought to have none him&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>He applauds him for his love to his young Lady: Profe&s;&s;es his honourable de&s;igns by her: Values him|&s;elf upon his word; and appeals to him on this head:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You know, Jo&s;eph, &s;ays he, that I have gone be|yond my promi&s;es to <HI>you.</HI> I do to every-body: And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e it is the be&s;t way of &s;hewing, that I have not a grudging or narrow &s;pirit. A ju&s;t
<PB N="234" REF="235">
man will keep his promi&s;e: A generous man will go beyond it. That is my rule.'</Q></P>
<P>He lays it wholly at the Lady's door, that they are not marry'd; and laments the di&s;tance &s;ee keeps him at; which he attributes to Mi&s;s Howe, who, he &s;ays, is for ever putting her upon contrivances; which is the rea&s;on, he tells him, that has obliged him to play off the people at Harlowe-Place upon Mrs. Howe, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He then takes advantage of the hints Jo&s;eph gives him of Singleton and James Harlowes clo&s;e con|ferences:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Since Singleton, &s;ays he, who has de|pendencies upon James Harlowe, is taught to have &s;o good an opinion of you, Jo&s;eph, cannot you (&s;till pretending an abhorrence of me, and of my contrivances) propo&s;e to Singleton to propo&s;e to James Harlowe (who &s;o much thir&s;ts for revenge upon me), to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his whole &s;hip's crew, upon occa&s;ion, to carry off his &s;i&s;ter, to Leith, where both have hou&s;es, or el&s;ewhere?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You may tell them, that if this can be effected, it will make, me raving mad; and bring your young Lady into all their mea&s;ures. You can inform them, as from my &s;ervant, of the di&s;tance &s;he keeps me at, in hopes of procuring her father's forgivene&s;s, by cruelly giving me up, if in&s;i&s;ted upon. That as the only &s;ecret my &s;ervant has kept from you, is, the place we are in, you make no doubt, that a two guinea bribe will bring that out, and al&s;o an informa|tion when I &s;hall be at di&s;tance from her, that the enterprize may be &s;afely conducted.

be overjoy'd at any thing that will help forward her revenge upon me; and will reveal it (if her brother do not) to her uncle Antony. He probably will whi&s;per it to Mrs. Howe. She can keep nothing from her daughter, tho' they are always jangling. Her daughter will acquaint my beloved with it. And if it will not, or if it will, come to my ears from &s;ome of tho&s;e, you can write it to me, as in confidence, by way of preventing mi&s;chief, which is the &s;tudy of us both. I can then &s;hew it to my be|loved. Then will &s;he be for placing a greater confi|dence in me. That will convince me of her love, which now I am &s;ometimes ready to doubt.

<SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING not had the favour of an an&s;wer to a letter I took the liberty to write to you on the 14th, I am in &s;ome hopes that it may have mi&s;carried; for I had much rather it &s;hould, than to have the mortification to think, that my aunt Hervey deem'd me unworthy of the honour of her notice.</P>
<P>In this hope, having kept a copy of it, and not being able to expre&s;s my&s;elf in terms better &s;uited to the unhappy circum&s;tance of things, I tran&s;cribe and inclo&s;e what I then wrote <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The contents of this letter are given p. <HI>140, 141.</HI></NOTE>. And I humbly be&s;eech you to favour the contents of it with your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Hitherto it is in my power to perform what I under|take for in this letter; and it would be very grievous
<PB N="237" REF="238">

<P>If, Madam, I were permitted to write to you with the hopes of being an&s;wer'd, I could clear my inten|tion with regard to the &s;tep I have taken, altho' I could not acquit my&s;elf, perhaps, to &s;ome of my &s;evere&s;t judges, of an imprudence previous to it.&mdash;You, I am &s;ure, would pity me, if you knew all I could &s;ay, and how mi&s;erable I am in the forfeiture of the good opinion of all my friends.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, that <HI>their</HI> favour is yet retrievable. But whatever be the determination at Harlowe-Place, do not <HI>you,</HI> my deare&s;t aunt, deny me the favour of a few lines, to inform me if there can be any hope of a reconciliation upon terms le&s;s &s;hocking than tho&s;e heretofore endeavoured to be impo&s;ed upon me; or if, which God forbid! I am to be for ever repro|bated.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t, my dear aunt, procure for me the ju&s;tice of my wearing apparel, and the little money, and other things, which I wrote to my &s;i&s;ter for, and men|tion in the inclo&s;ed to you; that I may not be de|&s;titute of common conveniencies, or be under a nece&s;|&s;ity to owe an obligation for &s;uch, where (at pre&s;ent, however) I would lea&s;t of all owe it.</P>
<P>Allow me to &s;ay, that had I <HI>de&s;igned</HI> what hap|pened, I might, as to the money and jewels, at lea&s;t, have &s;aved my&s;elf &s;ome of the mortifications which I have &s;uffer'd, and which I &s;till farther apprehend, if my reque&s;t be not comply'd with.</P>
<P>If you are permitted to encourage an eclairci&s;&s;ement of what I hint, I will open my whole heart to you, and inform you of every thing.</P>
<P>If it be any plea&s;ure to have me mortify'd, be plea&s;ed to let it be known, that I am extremely mor|tify'd: And yet it is <HI>intirely</HI> from my own reflections that I am &s;o:&mdash;Having nothing to find fault with, in the

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. April 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot for my life account for your wretch's teaz|ing ways. But he certainly doubts your love of him. In this <HI>he</HI> is a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man, as well as &s;omebody el&s;e; and tacitly confe&s;&s;es, that he does not de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Your I&s;raeliti&s;h hankerings after the Egyptian onions [te&s;tify'd &s;till more in your letter to your aunt] Your often-repeated regrets for meeting him; for being betrayed away by him: The&s;e he cannot bear.</P>
<P>I have been retro&s;pecting the whole of his conduct, and comparing it with his general character; and find, that he is more <HI>con&s;i&s;tently,</HI> more <HI>uniformly,</HI> mean, re|vengeful, and proud, than either of us once ima|gin'd.</P>
<P>From his cradle, as I may &s;ay, as an <HI>only child,</HI> and a <HI>boy,</HI> humour&s;ome, &s;poiled, mi&s;chievous; the go|vernor of his governors.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="240">A libertine in his riper years, hardly regardful of appearances; and de&s;pi&s;ing the Sex in general, for the faults of particulars of it, who made them&s;elves too cheap to him.</P>
<P>What has been his behaviour in your family, a CLARISSA in view (from the time your fooli&s;h bro|ther was obliged to take a life from him) but defiance for defiances?&mdash;Getting you into his power by terror, by artifice. What politene&s;s can be expected from &s;uch a man?</P>
<P>Well, but what in &s;uch a &s;ituation is to be done?&mdash;Why, you mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e him&mdash;You mu&s;t hate him&mdash;if you can&mdash;and run away from him&mdash;But whither?&mdash;E&s;pecially now that your brother is laying fooli&s;h plots to put you in a &s;till wor&s;e condition, as it may happen?</P>
<P>But if you cannot de&s;pi&s;e and hate him&mdash;If you care not to break with him, you mu&s;t part with &s;ome pun|ctilio's; and if the &s;o doing bring not on the &s;olemnity, you mu&s;t put your&s;elf into the protection of the ladies of his family.</P>
<P>Their re&s;pect for you is of it&s;elf a &s;ecurity for his honour, if there could be any room for doubt. And at lea&s;t you &s;hould remind him of his offer to bring one of the Mi&s;s Montague's to attend you at your new lodgings in town, and accompany you, till all is happily over.</P>
<P>This, you'll &s;ay, will be as good as <HI>declaring</HI> your|&s;elf to be his. And &s;o let it. You ought not now to think of any thing el&s;e but to be <HI>his.</HI> Does not your brother's project convince you more and more of this?</P>
<P>Give over then, my deare&s;t friend, any thoughts of this hopele&s;s reconciliation, which has kept you ba|lancing thus long. You own, in the letter before me, that he made very explicit offers, tho' you give me not the very words.&mdash;And he gave his rea&s;ons, I per|ceive,
<PB N="240" REF="241">
with his wi&s;hes that you &s;hould accept them: Which very few of the &s;orry fellows do; who&s;e plea is generally but a compliment to our &s;elf-love&mdash;<HI>That we mu&s;t love them,</HI> however pre&s;umptuous and un|worthy, <HI>becau&s;e they love us.</HI></P>
<P>Were I in <HI>your place,</HI> and had <HI>your</HI> charming deli|cacies, I &s;hould, perhaps, do as you do. No doubt but I &s;hould expect that the man &s;hould urge me with re&s;pectful warmth; that he &s;hould &s;upplicate with con&s;tancy, and that all his words and actions &s;hould tend to the one principal point&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, if I &s;u&s;pected art or delay, founded upon his doubts of my love, I would either conde&s;cend to clear up his doubts, or renounce him for ever.</P>
<P>And in this la&s;t ca&s;e, I, your Anna Howe, would exert my&s;elf, and either find you a private refuge, or re&s;olve to &s;hare fortunes with you.</P>
<P>What a wretch, to be &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd by your reference to the arrival of your cou&s;in Morden? But I am afraid that you was too &s;crupulous:&mdash;For did he not re&s;ent that reference?</P>
<P>Could we have <HI>his</HI> account of the matter, I fancy, my dear, I &s;hould think you over-nice, over-delicate. Had you laid hold of his <HI>acknowleged</HI> explicitne&s;s, he would have been as much in <HI>your</HI> power, as now you &s;eem to be in <HI>his?</HI>&mdash;You wanted not to be told, that the per&s;on who had been tricked into &s;uch a &s;tep as you had taken, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ubmit to many mortifications.</P>
<P>But were it to <HI>me,</HI> a girl of &s;pirit, as I am thought to be, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I would in a quarter of an hour (all the time I would allow to punctilio in &s;uch a ca&s;e as yours) know what he drives at. Since either he mu&s;t mean <HI>well</HI> or <HI>ill.</HI> If <HI>ill,</HI> the &s;ooner you know it, the better. If <HI>well,</HI> who&s;e mode&s;t, is it he di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but that of his own wife?</P>
<P>And methinks you &s;hould endeavour to avoid all
<PB N="241" REF="242">
exa&s;perating recriminations, as to what you have heard of his failure in morals; e&s;pecially while you are &s;o happy, as not to have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of them by experience.</P>
<P>I grant, that it gives a worthy mind &s;ome &s;atisfaction, in having borne its te&s;timony again&s;t a bad one: But if the te&s;timony be not &s;ea&s;onably borne, and when the faulty per&s;on be fitted to receive the correction, it may probably rather harden, or make an hypocrite, than reclaim him.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed, however, as well as you, with his making light of your brother's wi&s;e project.&mdash;Poor creature!&mdash;And mu&s;t ma&s;ter Jemmy Harlowe, with his half-wit, pretend to plot, and contrive mi&s;chief, yet rail at Lovelace for the &s;ame things?&mdash;A witty vil|lain de&s;erves hanging at once (and without ceremony, if you plea&s;e); but a half-witted one de&s;erves broken bones fir&s;t, and hanging afterwards. I think Love|lace has given his character in few words.</P>
<P>Be angry at me, if you plea&s;e; but as &s;ure as you are alive, now that this poor creature, whom &s;ome call your brother, finds he has &s;ucceeded in making you fly your father's hou&s;e, and that he has nothing to fear but your getting into your <HI>own,</HI> and into an inde|pendence of him, but he thinks him&s;elf equal to any thing, and &s;o has a mind to fight Lovelace with his own weapons?</P>
<P>Don't you remember his pragmatical triumph, as told you by your aunt, and prided in by that &s;awcy Betty Barnes, from his own fooli&s;h mouth <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 300, 301&mdash;304, 305.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>I expect nothing from your letter to your aunt. I hope Lovelace will never know the contents of it. In every one of yours, I &s;ee that he as warmly re&s;ents as he dares, the little confidence you have in him. I &s;hould re&s;ent it too, were I him; and knew I de&s;erved better.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">Don't be &s;crupulous about cloaths, if you think of putting your&s;elf into the protection of the ladies of his family. They know how matters &s;tand between you and your relations; and love you never the wor&s;e for their cruelty.&mdash;As to money, why will you let me offer in vain?</P>
<P>I know you won't demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your e&s;tate. But give <HI>him</HI> a right to demand it for you; and that will be &s;till better.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday, April 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOU, Lovelace, ha&s;t been long the <HI>entertainer</HI>; I the <HI>entertained.</HI> Nor have I been &s;olicitous to animadvert, as thou wente&s;t along, upon thy inven|tions, and their tendency. For I believed, that with all thy airs, the unequalled perfections and fine quali|ties of this lady would always be her protection and &s;ecurity. But now, that I find, thou ha&s;t &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded, as to induce her to come to town, and to choo&s;e her lodgings in a hou&s;e, the people of which will too probably damp and &s;uppre&s;s any honourable motions, which may ari&s;e in thy mind in her favour; I cannot help writing: And that profe&s;&s;edly in her behalf.</P>
<P>My inducements to this are not owing to virtue:&mdash;But if they <HI>were,</HI> what hope could I have of affecting thee, by pleas ari&s;ing from it?</P>
<P>Nor would &s;uch a man as thou art be deterr'd, were I to remind thee of the vengeance which thou maye&s;t one day expect, if thou in&s;ulte&s;t a woman of her cha|racter, family, and fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="244">Neither are gratitude and honour motives to be mentioned in a woman's favour, to men, &s;uch as we are, who con&s;ider all tho&s;e of the &s;ex as fair prize, whom we can obtain a power over. For <HI>our honour,</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> in the <HI>general acceptation</HI> of the word, are two things.</P>
<P>What then is my motive?&mdash;Why, the true friend|&s;hip that I bear thee, Lovelace; which makes me plead <HI>Thy own &s;ake</HI>; and <HI>Thy family's &s;ake,</HI> in the ju&s;tice thou owe&s;t to this incomparable creature; who, however, &s;o well de&s;erves to have <HI>her &s;ake</HI> to be mentioned as the principal con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>La&s;t time I was at M. Hall, thy noble uncle &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed me to u&s;e my intere&s;t to per&s;uade thee to enter the pale, and gave me &s;o many family-rea&s;ons for it, that I could not help engaging my&s;elf heartily on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and the rather, as I knew, that thy own intentions with regard to this fine woman, were then worthy of <HI>her.</HI> And of this I a&s;&s;ured his lord&s;hip; who was half-afraid of thee, becau&s;e of the ill u&s;age thou received&s;t from her fa|mily. But now, that the ca&s;e is altered, let me pre&s;s the matter home to thee from other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>By what I have heard of this lady's perfections from every mouth, as well as from thine, and from every letter thou ha&s;t written, where wilt thou find &s;uch another woman? And why &s;hould&s;t thou tempt her virtue?&mdash;Why &s;hould&s;t thou be for trying, where there is no rea&s;on to doubt?</P>
<P>Were I in thy ca&s;e, and de&s;igned to marry, and if I preferred a lady, as I know thou do&s;t This, to all the women in the world, I &s;hould dread to make fur|ther tryal, knowing what <HI>we</HI> know of the &s;ex, for <HI>fear</HI> of &s;ucceeding; and e&s;pecially if I doubted not, that if there were a woman in the world virtuous at heart, it is &s;he.</P>
<P>And let me tell thee, Lovelace, that in this lady's &s;ituation, the tryal is not a fair tryal.&mdash;Con&s;idering
<PB N="244" REF="245">
the depth or thy plots and contrivances: Con&s;idering the opportunities which I &s;ee thou mu&s;t have with her, in &s;pite of her own heart; all her relations follies acting in concert, tho' unknown to them&s;elves, with thy wicked &s;cheming head: Con&s;idering how de&s;titute of protection &s;he is: Con&s;idering the hou&s;e &s;he is to be in, where &s;he will be &s;urrounded with thy imple|ments; <HI>&s;pecious, well-bred,</HI> and <HI>genteel</HI> creatures, not ea&s;ily to be detected when they are di&s;po&s;ed to pre|&s;erve appearances, e&s;pecially by a young, inexpe|rienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town: Con&s;idering all the&s;e things, I &s;ay,&mdash;what glory, what cau&s;e of triumph, wilt thou have, if &s;he &s;hould be overcome?&mdash;Thou, too, a man born for intrigue, full of invention, intrepid, remor&s;ele&s;s, able patiently to watch for thy opportunity; not hurried, as mo&s;t men, by gu&s;ts of violent pa&s;&s;ion, which often nip a project in the bud, and make the &s;nail that was ju&s;t putting out its horns to meet the inviter, withdraw into its &s;hell&mdash;A man who has no regard to his word or oath to the &s;ex; the lady &s;crupulou&s;ly &s;trict to <HI>her</HI> word, incapable of art or de&s;ign; apt therefore to believe well of others&mdash;It would be a miracle if &s;he &s;tood &s;uch an attempter, &s;uch attempts, and &s;uch &s;nares, as I &s;ee will be laid for her. And after all, I &s;ee not when men are &s;o frail <HI>without</HI> importunity, that &s;o much &s;hould be expected from women, daugh|ters of the &s;ame fathers and mothers, and made up of the &s;ame brittle compounds [education all the differ|ence], nor where the triumph is in &s;ubduing them.</P>
<P>May there not be other Lovelaces, thou a&s;ke&s;t, who, attracted by her beauty, may endeavour to pre|vail with her?</P>
<P>No; there cannot, I an&s;wer, be &s;uch another man, per&s;on, mind, fortune, and thy character, as above given, taken in.&mdash;If thou imagined&s;t there could, &s;uch is thy pride, that thou would&s;t think the wor&s;e of thy&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246">But let me touch upon thy predominant pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Revenge</HI>; for <HI>Love</HI> [What can be the love of a rake?] is but &s;econd to that, as I have often told thee, tho' it has &s;et thee into raving at me&mdash;What poor pretences for revenge are the difficulties thou had&s;t in getting her off; allowing that &s;he had run a ri&s;que of being Solmes's wife, had &s;he &s;taid; her injunctions &s;o cru|elly turn'd upon her; and her preference of the &s;ingle life!&mdash;If the&s;e are other than pretences, why thanke&s;t thou not tho&s;e who threw her into thy power?&mdash;Be&s;ides, are not the pretences thou make&s;t for further trial, mo&s;t ingratefully, as well as contra|dictorily, founded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of error in her, occa&s;ioned by her <HI>favour</HI> to thee?</P>
<P>And let me, for the utter confu&s;ion of thy poor pleas of this nature, a&s;k thee&mdash;Would &s;he, in thy opinion, had &s;he willingly gone off with thee, have been intitled to better quarter?&mdash;For a <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> in|deed &s;he might: But would&s;t thou for a <HI>wife</HI> have had cau&s;e to like her half &s;o well, as now?</P>
<P>That &s;he loves thee, wicked as thou art, and cruel as a panther, there is no rea&s;on to doubt. Yet, what a command has &s;he over her&s;elf, that &s;uch a penetrate|ing &s;elf-flatterer as thy&s;elf, art &s;ometimes ready to doubt it? Tho' per&s;ecuted on the one hand, as &s;he was, by her own family, and attracted on the other, by the &s;plendor of thine; every one of whom wi&s;hes for, and courts her to rank her&s;elf among them?</P>
<P>Thou wilt perhaps think, that I have departed from my propo&s;ition, and pleaded the <HI>lady's &s;ake</HI> more than <HI>thine</HI> in the above&mdash;But no &s;uch thing. All that I have written, is more in thy behalf than in hers&mdash;Since &s;he may make <HI>thee</HI> happy&mdash;But it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, I &s;hould think, if &s;he pre&s;erves her delicacy, that thou can&s;t make <HI>her</HI> &s;o. I need not give my rea&s;ons. Thou'lt have ingenuity enough, I dare &s;ay, were there occa&s;ion for it, to &s;ub&s;cribe to my opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="247">I plead not for the &s;tate from any great liking to it my&s;elf. Nor have I, at pre&s;ent, thoughts of en|tering into it.

A lady, in her fa|mily and fortune, not unworthy of thine own [tho' thou art &s;o apt, from pride of ance&s;try, and pride of heart, to &s;peak &s;lightly of the families thou di&s;like&s;t]; &s;o celebrated for beauty; and &s;o noted at the &s;ame time for prudence, for <HI>&s;oul</HI> (I will &s;ay, in&s;tead of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI>), and for virtue?</P>

<P>Wicked as the &s;ober world accounts us, we have not yet, it is to be hoped, got over all compunction. Altho' we find religion again&s;t us, we have not yet pre&s;umed to make a religion to &s;uit our practices. We de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who do.

As &s;oon as I was intru&s;ted my&s;elf with their <HI>intention</HI> to give up the point, I gave you a hint&mdash;a dark one perhaps <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>II.</HI> p. <HI>302.</HI></NOTE>!&mdash;But who would have thought&mdash;O Mi&s;s!&mdash;Such an <HI>artful</HI> &s;light!&mdash;Such <HI>cunning</HI> preparation!</P>

<P>You did not <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to go, you &s;ay. Why did you meet him then, chariot-and-&s;ix, hor&s;emen, all pre|pared by him?

<P>I'll tell you all that was intended, if you had.</P>
<P>It was indeed imagined, that you would not have been able to re&s;i&s;t your father's intreaties and com|mands. He was re&s;olved to be all conde&s;cen&s;ion, if anew you had not provoked him. <HI>I love my Clary Harlowe,</HI> &s;aid he, but an hour before the killing tide|ings were brought him; <HI>I love her as my life; I will kneel to her, if nothing el&s;e will do, to prevail upon her to oblige me!</HI></P>
<P>Your father and mother (rever&s;e to what &s;hould have been!) would have humbled them&s;elves to <HI>you:</HI> And if you <HI>could</HI> have denied them, and refu&s;ed to &s;ign the &s;ettlements previous to the meeting, they would have yielded, altho' with regret.</P>
<P>But it was pre&s;umed, &s;o naturally &s;weet your tem|per, &s;o &s;elf-denying, as they thought you, that you could <HI>not</HI> have with&s;tood them, notwith&s;tanding all your di&s;like of the <HI>one</HI> man, without a greater degree of head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>other,</HI> than you had given any of us rea&s;on to expect from you.</P>
<P>If you <HI>had,</HI> the meeting on Wedne&s;day would have been a lighter trial to you. You would have been pre&s;ented to all your a&s;&s;embled friends, with a &s;hort &s;peech only,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That this was the young creature, till very lately &s;aultle&s;s, conde&s;cending, and ob|liging, now having cau&s;e to glory in a triumph over the wills of father, mother, uncles, the mo&s;t in|dulgent; over family intere&s;ts, family views, and preferring her own will to every-body's; and this for a tran&s;itory preference to <HI>per&s;on</HI> only; the mo|rals of the men not to be compared with each other's.'</Q></P>

Some re&s;trictions, which you your&s;elf had propo&s;ed, would have been in&s;i&s;ted upon. You would have been permitted to go home with me, or with your uncle Antony [<HI>which,</HI> not agreed upon, becau&s;e they hoped you might be prevailed with], there to tarry till the arrival of your cou&s;in Morden; or till your father could have borne to &s;ee you; or till a&s;&s;ured, that the views of Lovelace were at an end.</P>
<P>This the intention, your father &s;o &s;et upon your compliance, &s;o much in hopes that you would have yielded, that you would have been prevailed upon by methods &s;o conde&s;cending and &s;o gentle; no wonder that <HI>he,</HI> in particular, was like a di&s;tracted man, when he heard of your flight&mdash;of your flight, &s;o <HI>premedi|tated</HI>;&mdash;with your ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e dinings, your arts to blind me, and all of us!&mdash;naughty, naughty young creature!</P>
<P>I, for my part, would not believe it, when told of it. Your uncle Hervey would not believe it. We rather expected, we rather feared, a &s;till more de&s;perate ad|venture. There could be but one more de&s;perate; and I was readier to have the ca&s;cade fir&s;t re&s;orted to, than the garden back-door.&mdash;Your mamma fainted away, while her heart was torn between the two ap|prehen&s;ions.&mdash;Your father, poor man! your father, was be&s;ide him&s;elf for near an hour.

<P>You mu&s;t now make the be&s;t of your lot. Yet <HI>not</HI> married, it &s;eems!</P>
<P>It is in your power, you &s;ay, to perform whatever you &s;hall undertake to do: You may deceive your|&s;elf: You hope that your reputation, and your friends favour, may be retrieved.

<HEAD>LETTER LI. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE;</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI> [With the preceding.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Morn. April 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have ju&s;t now received the inclo&s;ed from my aunt Hervey. Be plea&s;ed, my dear, to keep her &s;ecret of having written to the unhappy wretch, her niece.</P>
<P>I may go to London, I &s;ee, or where I will. No matter what becomes of me.</P>
<P>I was the willinger to &s;u&s;pend my journey thither, till I heard from Harlowe-Place. I thought, if I could be encouraged to hope for a reconciliation, I would let this man &s;ee, that he &s;hould not have me in his power, but upon my own terms, if at all.</P>
<P>But I find I mu&s;t be <HI>his,</HI> whether I will or not; and perhaps thro' &s;till greater mortifications than tho&s;e great ones which I have already met with.&mdash;And mu&s;t I be &s;o ab&s;olutely thrown upon a man, with whom I am not at all &s;atisfied!</P>
<P>My letter is &s;ent, you &s;ee, to Harlowe-Place. My heart akes for the reception it may meet with there. One comfort only ari&s;es to me from its being &s;ent; That my aunt will clear her&s;elf, by the communica|tion, from the &s;uppo&s;ition of having corre&s;ponded with the poor creature whom they have all determined to reprobate. It is no &s;mall part of my misfortune, that I have weaken'd the confidence one dear friend has in another, and made one look cool upon another. My poor cou&s;in Dolly, you &s;ee, has rea&s;on to regret this, as well as my aunt. Mi&s;s Howe, my dear Mi&s;s
<PB N="254" REF="255">
Howe, is but too &s;en&s;ible of the effects of my fault, having had more words with her mother on my ac|count, than ever &s;he had on any other. Yet the man who has drawn me into all this evil, I mu&s;t be thrown upon!&mdash;Much did I con&s;ider, much did I apprehend, <HI>before</HI> my fault, &s;uppo&s;ing I <HI>were</HI> to be guilty of it: But I &s;aw it not in all its &s;hocking lights.</P>
<P>And now, to know that my father, an hour before he received the tidings of my &s;uppo&s;ed flight, owned that he loved me as his life: That he would have been all conde&s;cen&s;ion: That he would&mdash;Oh! my dear, how tender, how mortifyingly-tender, now in him! My aunt need not have been afraid, that it &s;hould be known, that &s;he has &s;ent me &s;uch a letter as this!&mdash;A father to KNEEL to a daughter!&mdash;There would not indeed have been any bearing of that!&mdash;What I &s;hould have done in &s;uch a ca&s;e, I know not. Death would have been much more welcome to me, than &s;uch a fight, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, in behalf of a man &s;o very, very di&s;gu&s;tful to me! But I had de&s;erved annihilation, had I &s;uffered my father to kneel in vain.</P>
<P>Yet, had but the &s;acrifice of <HI>inclination</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal preference,</HI> been <HI>all,</HI> le&s;s than KNEELING &s;hould have done. My <HI>duty</HI> &s;hould have been the conqueror of my <HI>inclination.</HI> But an aver&s;ion&mdash;an aver&s;ion &s;o <HI>very</HI> &s;incere!&mdash;The triumph of a cruel and ambitious brother, ever &s;o uncontroulable, joined with the in|&s;ults of an envious &s;i&s;ter, bringing wills to <HI>theirs,</HI> which otherwi&s;e would have been favourable to <HI>me:</HI> The marriage-duties &s;o very &s;trong, &s;o &s;olemnly to be engaged for: The marriage-intimacies (permit me to &s;ay to you, my friend, what the pure&s;t, altho' with apprehen&s;ion, mu&s;t think of) &s;o <HI>very</HI> intimate: My|&s;elf one, who never looked upon any duty, much le&s;s a voluntarily-vow'd one, with indifference; could it have been hone&s;t in me to have given my hand to an
<PB N="255" REF="256">
odious hand, and to have con&s;ented to &s;uch a more than reluctant, &s;uch an <HI>immi&s;cible</HI> union, if I may &s;o call it?&mdash;For life too!&mdash;Did I not <HI>think</HI> more and deeper than mo&s;t young creatures think; did I not <HI>weigh,</HI> did I not <HI>reflect</HI>; I might perhaps have been le&s;s ob&s;tinate.&mdash;<HI>Delicacy</HI> (may I pre&s;ume to call, it?), <HI>thinking, weighing, reflection,</HI> are not ble&s;&s;ings (I have not found them &s;uch) in the degree I have them. I wi&s;h I had been able, in &s;ome very nice ca&s;es, to have known what <HI>indifference</HI> was; yet not to have my <HI>ig|norance</HI> imputable to me as a fault. Oh! my dear! the finer &s;en&s;ibilities, if I may &s;uppo&s;e mine to be &s;uch, make not happy!</P>
<P>What a method had my friends intended to take with me!&mdash;This, I dare &s;ay, was a method chalked out by my brother. <HI>He,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, was to have pre|&s;ented me to all my a&s;&s;embled friends, as the daugh|ter capable of preferring her own will to the wills of them all. It would have been a &s;ore trial, no doubt. Would to heaven, however, I had &s;tood it&mdash;Let the i&s;&s;ue have been what it would, would to heaven I had &s;tood it!</P>
<P>There may be murder, my aunt &s;ays. This looks as if &s;he knew of Singleton's ra&s;h plot. Such an <HI>up|&s;hot,</HI> as &s;he calls it, of this unhappy affair, Heaven avert!</P>
<P>She flies a thought, that I can <HI>le&s;s</HI> dwell upon&mdash;A <HI>cruel</HI> thought!&mdash;But &s;he has a poor opinion of the purity &s;he compliments me with, if &s;he thinks, that I am not, by God's grace, above temptation from this &s;ex. Altho' I never &s;aw a man, who&s;e <HI>per&s;on</HI> I could like, before this man; yet his faulty character allowed me but little merit from the indifference I pre|tended to on his account. But, now I &s;ee him in nearer lights, I like him le&s;s than ever.&mdash;Indeed, I never liked him &s;o little as now. Upon my word, I think I could hate him (if I do not already hate him) &s;ooner than any man I ever thought tolerably of.&mdash;A
<PB N="256" REF="257">
good rea&s;on why: Becau&s;e I have been more di&s;ap|pointed in my expectations of him; altho' they never were &s;o high, as to have made him my choice in pre|ference to the &s;ingle life, had that been permitted me. Still, if the giving him up for ever will make my path to reconciliation ea&s;y, and if they will &s;ignify as much to me, they &s;hall &s;ee that I never will be <HI>his:</HI> For I have the vanity to think my &s;oul his &s;oul's &s;uperior.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay I rave: Forbid to write to my aunt, and taught to de&s;pair of reconciliation, you, my dear, mu&s;t be troubled with my pa&s;&s;ionate re&s;ent|ments. What a wretch was I to meet him, and thereby to leave it not in my power to &s;tand the ge|neral meeting with my friends!&mdash;All would now have been over!&mdash;And who can tell, when my pre|&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es will?&mdash;Rid of both men, I had been now perhaps at my aunt Hervey's, or at my uncle Antony's; wi&s;hing for my cou&s;in Morden's arrival; who might have accommodated all.</P>
<P>I <HI>intended,</HI> indeed, to have &s;tood it&mdash;And, if I had, how know I by who&s;e name I might now have been called? For how &s;hould I have re&s;i&s;ted a con|de&s;cending, a <HI>kneeling</HI> father, had he been able to have kept his temper with me!</P>
<P>Yet my aunt &s;ays, <HI>he</HI> would have relented, if <HI>I</HI> had not. Perhaps he would have been moved by my humility, before he could have &s;hewn &s;uch <HI>undue</HI> conde&s;cen&s;ion. Such temper as he would have re|ceived me with, might have been improved upon in my favour. And that he had de&s;ign'd <HI>ultimately</HI> to relent, how it clears my friends, at lea&s;t to them|&s;elves, and condemns me! O why were my aunt's hints [I remember them now] &s;o <HI>very</HI> dark?&mdash;Yet I intended to have returned after the interview; and then perhaps &s;he would have explain'd her&s;elf.&mdash;O this artful, this de&s;igning Lovelace!&mdash;Yet I mu&s;t re|peat, that mo&s;t ought I to blame my&s;elf for meeting him.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258">But far, far, be bani&s;h'd from me, fruitle&s;s recri|mination! Far bani&s;hed, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> fruitle&s;s!

<P>BE comforted; be not dejected; do not de&s;pond, my deare&s;t and be&s;t-beloved friend. God Al|mighty is ju&s;t and gracious, and gives not his a&s;&s;ent to ra&s;h and inhuman cur&s;es. If he did, malice, envy, and the blacke&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, in the blacke&s;t hearts, would triumph, and the be&s;t (bla&s;ted by the malignity of the wor&s;t) would be mi&s;erable in both worlds.</P>
<P>This malediction &s;hews only, what manner of &s;pirit they are of, and how much their &s;ordid views exceed their parental love. 'Tis all rage and di&s;appointment, my dear; di&s;appointment in de&s;igns proper to be fru|&s;trated; and all you have to grieve for is, that their own ra&s;hne&s;s will turn upon their own hearts. God Almighty cannot &s;ucceed a cur&s;e &s;o pre&s;umptuous, as to be carried into <HI>his</HI> futurity!</P>
<P>Fie upon them!&mdash;Fie upon them, will all the world &s;ay, who &s;hall come to the knowlege of &s;uch overflowing venom!&mdash;And the more, when all &s;hall know, that what they re&s;ent &s;o outrageou&s;ly, is owe|ing to them&s;elves!</P>
<P>My mother blames them for this wicked letter; and &s;he pities you; and, of her own accord, wi&s;h'd me to write to comfort you, for this once: For &s;he &s;ays, It is pity your heart, which was &s;o noble (and when the &s;en&s;e of your fault, and the weight of a pa|rent's cur&s;e, are &s;o &s;trong upon you), &s;hould be quite broken.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">Lord ble&s;s me, how your aunt writes!&mdash;Can there be two rights and two wrongs in palpable ca&s;es!&mdash;But, my dear, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be wrong: So they all have been, ju&s;tify them&s;elves now as they will. They can only ju&s;tify them&s;elves <HI>to</HI> them&s;elves from &s;elfi&s;h prin|ciples, re&s;olving to <HI>acquit,</HI> not fairly to <HI>try</HI> them&s;elves. Did your unkind aunt, in all the tedious progre&s;s of your contentions with them, give you the lea&s;t hope of their relenting?&mdash;Her dark hints I now recollect, as well as you. But why was any thing good or hope|ful to you, to be <HI>darkly</HI> hinted?&mdash;How ea&s;y was it for <HI>her,</HI> who pretended always to love you &s;o well; for <HI>her,</HI> who can give &s;uch flowing licence to her pen for your hurt; to have given you one word, one line (in confidence) of their pretended change of mea&s;ures!</P>
<P>But don't mind their after-pretences, my dear&mdash;All of them &s;erve but for tacit confe&s;&s;ions of their vile u&s;age of you. I will keep your aunt's &s;ecret, never fear. I would not, on any con&s;ideration, that my mother &s;hould &s;ee it.</P>
<P>You will now &s;ee, that you have nothing left, but to overcome all &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s, and marry, as &s;oon as you have opportunity. Determine upon this, my dear.</P>
<P>I will give you a motive for it, regarding my&s;elf. For this I have re&s;olved, and this I have vowed [O friend, the be&s;t beloved of my heart, be not angry with me for it!]
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That &s;o long as your happine&s;s is in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, I will never think of marrying."</Q>
In ju&s;tice to the man I &s;hall have, I have vowed this: For, my dear, mu&s;t I not be mi&s;erable, if you are &s;o? And what an unworthy wife mu&s;t I be to any man, who cannot have intere&s;t enough in my heart, to make his obligingne&s;s a balance for an affliction he has not cau&s;ed?</P>
<P>I would &s;hew Lovelace your &s;i&s;ter's abominable letter, were it to me. I inclo&s;e it. It &s;hall not have a place in this hou&s;e. This will enter him of cour&s;e into
<PB N="263" REF="264">
the &s;ubject, which now you ought to have mo&s;t in view. Let him &s;ee what you &s;uffer for him. He cannot prove ba&s;e to &s;uch an excellence. I &s;hould never enjoy my head or my &s;en&s;es, &s;hould this man prove a villain to you! With a merit &s;o exalted, you may have puni&s;hment more than enough for your involuntary fault, in that hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I would not have you be too &s;ure, that their pro|ject to &s;eize you is over. The words intimating, that it is over, in the letter of that abominable Arabella, &s;eem calculated to give you &s;ecurity.&mdash;She only &s;ays, &s;he <HI>believes</HI> that de&s;ign is over.&mdash;And I do not yet find from Mi&s;s Lloyd, that it is di&s;avow'd. So it will be be&s;t, when you are at London, to be private, and to let every direction be to a third place; for fear of the wor&s;t; for I would not, for the world, have you fall into the hands of &s;uch flaming and malevo|lent &s;pirits, by &s;urprize.</P>
<P>I will my&s;elf be content to direct to you at &s;ome <HI>third</HI> place; and that I may have it to averr to my mother, or to any other, if occa&s;ion be, that I know not where you are.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this mea&s;ure will make you le&s;s apprehen|&s;ive of the con&s;equences of their violence, &s;hould they re&s;olve to attempt to carry you off in &s;pite of Lovelace.</P>
<P>I would have you direct to Mr. Hickman, even your an&s;wer to this. I have a rea&s;on for it. Be&s;ides, my mamma, notwith&s;tanding this particular indulg|ence, is very po&s;itive.</P>
<P>I would not have you dwell on the &s;hocking occa|&s;ion. I know how it mu&s;t affect you. But don't let it. Try to make light of it [Forget it you can't]: And pur&s;ue other &s;ubjects&mdash;The &s;ubjects before you. And let me know your progre&s;s, and what he &s;ays [So far may you enter into this hateful &s;ubject] to this abominable letter, and diabolical cur&s;e. I expect that this will aptly introduce the grand topic between you, without needing a mediator.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265">Come, my dear, when things are at wor&s;t, they mu&s;t mend. Good often comes, when evil is expect|ed. Happily improv'd upon, this very cur&s;e may turn to a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;But if you de&s;pond, there can be no hopes of cure.&mdash;Don't let them break your heart; for that, it is plain to me, is now what &s;ome people have in view to do.</P>
<P>How poor, to with-hold from you your books, your jewels, and your money!&mdash;The latter is all you can at pre&s;ent want, &s;ince they will vouch&s;afe to &s;end your cloaths.&mdash;I &s;end fifty guineas by the bearer, inclo&s;ed in &s;ingle papers in my <HI>Norris</HI>'s <HI>Mi&s;cellanies.</HI> I charge you, as you love me, return them not.</P>
<P>I have more at your &s;ervice. So if you like not your lodgings, or his behaviour, when you get to town, leave both out of hand.</P>
<P>I would advi&s;e you to write to Mr. Morden with|out delay. If he intends for England, it may ha&s;ten him. And you'll do very well till he can come. But &s;urely Lovelace is bewitched, if he takes not his hap|pine&s;s from <HI>your con&s;ent,</HI> before that of Mr. Morden's is made needful by his arrival.</P>
<P>Come, my dear, be comforted. All is ha&s;tening to be well. This very violence &s;hews that it is. Suppo&s;e your&s;elf to be <HI>me,</HI> and me to be <HI>you</HI> [You <HI>may</HI>&mdash;for your di&s;tre&s;s is mine]; and then give to your&s;elf tho&s;e con&s;olations which, in that ca&s;e, you would give me.

<P>I have as great apprehen&s;ions as you of the weight of a parent's cur&s;e: But not of the cur&s;e of tho&s;e parents, who have more to an&s;wer for, than the child, in the very errors they &s;o much re&s;ent. To intitle tho&s;e horrid words to efficacy, the parents views

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day Morning, April 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, my beloved Mi&s;s Howe, gives me great comfort. How &s;weetly do I experience the truth of the wi&s;e man's ob&s;ervation, <HI>That a faith|ful friend is the medicine of life!</HI></P>
<P>Your me&s;&s;enger finds me ju&s;t &s;etting out for Lon|don: The chai&s;e at the door. Already I have taken leave of the good widow, who has oblig'd me with the company of her elde&s;t daughter, at Mr. Love|lace's reque&s;t, while he rides by us. The young gentlewoman is to return in two or three days with the chai&s;e, in its way to my Lord M.'s Hertford&s;hire &s;eat.</P>
<P>I received this dreadful letter on Sunday, when Mr. Lovelace was out. He &s;aw, on his return, my extreme angui&s;h and dejection; and he was told how much wor&s;e I had been: For I had fainted away twice.</P>
<P>I think it has touch'd my head as well as my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">He would fain have &s;een it. But I would not per|mit that, becau&s;e of the threatnings he would have found in it, again&s;t him&s;elf. As it <HI>was,</HI> the effect it had upon me, made him break out into execrations and menaces. I was &s;o ill, that he him&s;elf advi&s;ed me to delay going to town on Monday, as I propo&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>He is extremely regardful and tender of me. All that you &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>would</HI> follow this violent letter, from him, <HI>has</HI> followed it. He has offer'd him&s;elf to my acceptance, in &s;o unre&s;erv'd a manner, that I am concern'd I have written &s;o freely and &s;o diffidently of him. Pray, my deare&s;t friend, keep to your&s;elf every thing that may appear di&s;reputable of him from me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, that his kind behaviour, and my low-&s;piritedne&s;s, co-operating with your former advice, and my unhappy &s;ituation, made me that very Sunday evening receive unre&s;ervedly his declarations: And now, indeed, I am more in his power than ever.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;es me every hour for fre&s;h tokens of my e&s;teem <HI>for</HI> him, and confidence <HI>in</HI> him. He owns, that he doubted the one, and was ready to de&s;pair of the other. And, as I have been brought to &s;ome verbal conce&s;&s;ions, if he &s;hould prove unworthy, I am &s;ure, I &s;hall have great rea&s;on to blame this violent letter: For I have no re&s;olution at all. Abandon'd thus of all my natural friends, and only you to pity me; and <HI>you</HI> re&s;trained as I may &s;ay; I have been forced to turn my de&s;olate heart to &s;uch protection as I could find.</P>
<P>All my comfort is, that your advice repeatedly given to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in your kind letter before me, warrants me. Upon the &s;trength of that, I now &s;et out the more chearfully to London: For, before, a heavy weight hung upon my heart, and, altho' I thought it be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t to go, yet my &s;pirit &s;unk, I
<PB N="267" REF="268">
know not why, at every motion I made towards a preparation for it.</P>
<P>I hope no mi&s;chief will happen on the road.&mdash;I hope the&s;e violent &s;pirits will not meet.</P>
<P>Every one is waiting for me.&mdash;Pardon me, my be&s;t, my kinde&s;t friend, that I return your Norris. In the&s;e more promi&s;ing pro&s;pects, I cannot have occa|&s;ion for your favour. Be&s;ides, I have &s;ome hope, that with my cloaths they will &s;end me what I wrote for, altho' it is deny'd me in the letter. If they do not, and if I &s;hould have occa&s;ion, I can but &s;ignify my wants to &s;o ready a friend. But I had rather me|thinks you &s;hould have it &s;till to &s;ay, if challeng'd, that nothing of this nature has been either reque&s;ted or done. I &s;ay This, with a view intirely to my future hopes of recovering your mamma's favour, which, next to that of my own father and mother, I am mo&s;t &s;olicitous to recover.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add one thing more, notwith&s;tanding my hurry; and that is: Mr. Lovelace offered to attend me to Lord M.'s, or to &s;end for his chaplain, ye&s;ter|day: He pre&s;s'd me to con&s;ent to this propo&s;al, mo&s;t earne&s;tly; and even &s;eem'd more de&s;irous to have the ceremony pa&s;s here, than at London: For when there, I had told him, it was time enough to con&s;ider of &s;o weighty and important a matter. Now, upon the receipt of your kind, your con&s;olatory letter, me|thinks I could almo&s;t wi&s;h it <HI>had been</HI> in my power to comply with his earne&s;t &s;olicitations. But this dread|ful letter has unhing'd my whole frame. Then &s;ome little punctilio &s;urely is nece&s;&s;ary. No preparation made. No articles drawn. No licence ready. Grief &s;o extreme: No plea&s;ure in pro&s;pect, nor &s;o much as in wi&s;h&mdash;O my dear, who could think of entering into &s;o &s;olemn an engagement! Who, <HI>&s;o</HI> unprepared, could &s;eem to be <HI>&s;o</HI> ready!</P>
<P>If I could flatter my&s;elf, that my indifference to all the joys of this life proceeded from <HI>proper</HI> motives,
<PB N="268" REF="269">
and not rather from the di&s;appointments and mortifi|cations my pride has met with, how much rather, I think, &s;hould I choo&s;e to be wedded to my &s;hroud, than to any man on earth!</P>
<P>Indeed I have at pre&s;ent no plea&s;ure, but in <HI>your</HI> friend&s;hip. Continue That to me, I be&s;eech you. If my heart ri&s;es hereafter to more, it mu&s;t be built on that foundation.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits &s;ink again, on &s;etting out. Excu&s;e this depth of vapouri&s;h dejection, which forbids me even <HI>hope,</HI> the cordial that keeps life from &s;tagnating, and which never was deny'd me, till within the&s;e eight-and-forty hours.</P>

<P>I Am &s;orry you return'd my Norris. But you mu&s;t be allow'd to do as you plea&s;e. So mu&s;t I, in return. We mu&s;t neither of us, perhaps, expect ab|&s;olutely of the other what is the righte&s;t to be done: And yet few folks, &s;o young, better know, <HI>what that righte&s;t is.</HI> I cannot &s;eparate my&s;elf from you, my dear; altho' I give a double in&s;tance of my vanity in this particular compliment to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am mo&s;t heartily rejoiced, that your pro&s;pects are &s;o much mended; and that, as I hoped, good has been produced out of evil. What mu&s;t the man have been, what mu&s;t have been his views, had he not taken &s;uch a turn, upon a letter &s;o vile, and treatment &s;o unna|tural, him&s;elf principally the occa&s;ion of it?</P>
<P>You <HI>know be&s;t</HI> your motives for &s;u&s;pending: But I wi&s;h you had taken him at offers &s;o earne&s;t. Why
<PB N="269" REF="270">
&s;hould you not have permitted him to &s;end for Lord M.'s chaplain? If punctilio only was in the way, and want of a licence, and of proper preparations, and &s;uch-like, my &s;ervice to you, my dear: And there is ceremony tantamount to your ceremony.</P>
<P>Don't, don't, my dear friend, <HI>again</HI> be &s;o very melancholy a decliner, as to prefer a &s;hroud, when the matter you wi&s;h for is in your power; and when, as you have &s;aid ju&s;tly heretofore, per&s;ons cannot die when they will.</P>
<P>But it is a &s;trange perver&s;ene&s;s in human nature, that we covet at a di&s;tance, what when near we flight.</P>
<P>You have now but one point to pur&s;ue: That is marriage. Let that be compa&s;&s;ed. Leave the re&s;t to Providence; and follow as that leads. You'll have a hand&s;ome man, a genteel man; he would be a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> man, if he were not vain of his endowments, and wild and intriguing: But while the eyes of many of our &s;ex, taken by &s;o &s;pecious a form, and &s;o brilliant a &s;pirit, encourage that vanity, you mu&s;t be contented to &s;tay till grey hairs and prudence enter upon the &s;tage together. You would not have every thing in the &s;ame man.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Hickman treads no crooked paths; but he hobbles mo&s;t ungracefully in a &s;trait one. Yet Hickman, tho' he <HI>plea&s;es</HI> not my eye, nor <HI>diverts</HI> my ear, will not, as I believe, <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> the one, nor <HI>&s;hock</HI> the other. Your man, as I have lately &s;aid, will al|ways keep up attention; you will always be alive with him, tho' perhaps more from fears than hopes: While Hickman will neither &s;ay any thing to keep one awake, nor yet, by &s;hocking adventures, make one's &s;lumbers unea&s;y.</P>
<P>I believe I now know which of the two men &s;o pru|dent a per&s;on as <HI>you</HI> would, at fir&s;t, have cho&s;en; nor doubt I, that you can gue&s;s which <HI>I</HI> would have made choice of, if I might. But proud as we are,
<PB N="270" REF="271">
the proude&s;t of us all can <HI>only</HI> refu&s;e, and many of us accept the but half-worthy, for fear a &s;till wor&s;e &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>If the men had cho&s;en for &s;pirits like their own, al|tho' Mr. Lovelace, at the long run, might have been too many for me, I don't doubt but I &s;hould have given heart-ake for heart-ake, for one half-year at lea&s;t; while you, with my dull-&s;wift, would have glided on <HI>as</HI> &s;erenely, <HI>as</HI> calmly, <HI>as</HI> accountably, as the &s;uccceding &s;ea&s;ons; and varying no otherwi&s;e than as they, to bring on new beauties and conve|niencies to all about you.</P>
<P>I WAS going on in this &s;tile&mdash;But my mamma broke in upon me, with a prohibitory a&s;pect.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"She gave me leave but for one letter only."</Q>
&mdash;She has &s;een your odious uncle; and they have been in clo&s;e conference again.</P>
<P>She has vexed me; I mu&s;t lay this by till I hear from you again; not knowing where to &s;end it.</P>
<P>Direct me to a <HI>Third place,</HI> as I de&s;ired in my for|mer.</P>
<P>I told my mother (on her challenging me), that I was writing indeed, and to you: But it was only to amu&s;e my&s;elf; for I prote&s;ted, that I knew not where to &s;end to you.</P>
<P>I hope that your next may inform me of your nup|tials, altho' the next to that were to acquaint me, that he was the ungratefulle&s;t mon&s;ter on earth; as he mu&s;t be, if not the kinde&s;t hu&s;band in it.</P>
<P>My mamma has vexed me. But &s;o, on revi&s;ing, I wrote before.&mdash;But &s;he has <HI>unhing'd</HI> me, as you call it&mdash;Pretended to catechi&s;e Hickman, I a&s;&s;ure you, for contributing to our &s;uppo&s;ed corre&s;pondence. Ca|techi&s;e him <HI>&s;everely</HI> too, upon my word!&mdash;I believe I have a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for the &s;neaking fellow; for
<PB N="271" REF="272">
I can't endure that any-body &s;hould treat him like a fool but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I believe, between you and me, the good Lady for|got her&s;elf. I heard her loud.&mdash;She po&s;&s;ibly imagin'd, that my papa was come to life again!&mdash;Yet the man's meekne&s;s might have &s;ooner convinced her, I &s;hould have thought; for my papa, it &s;eems, would talk as loud as &s;he:&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, tho' within a few yards of each other, as if both were out of their way, and were hollowing at half a mile's di&s;tance, to get in again.</P>
<P>I know you'll blame me for this &s;aucine&s;s.&mdash;But I told you I was vexed: And if I had not a &s;pirit, my parentage on both &s;ides might be doubted.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVII. From the &s;ame. Inclo&s;ed in the above.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, April 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been making inquiry, as I told you I would, whether your relations had really (before you left them) re&s;olved upon that change of mea&s;ures which your aunt mentions in her letter:&mdash;And by laying together &s;everal pieces of intelligence, &s;ome drawn from my mamma, by your uncle Antony's communications; &s;ome from Mi&s;s Lloyd, by your &s;i&s;ters; and &s;ome by a third way, that I &s;hall not tell you of; I have rea&s;on to think the following a true &s;tate of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>That there was no intention of a change of mea|&s;ures,
<PB N="272" REF="273">
till within two or three days of your going away. On the contrary, your brother and &s;i&s;ter, tho' they had no hope of prevailing with you in Solmes's favour, were re&s;olved never to give over their per&s;ecutions, till they had pu&s;h'd you upon take|ing &s;ome &s;tep, which, by help of their good offices, &s;hould be deemed inexcu&s;able by the half-witted &s;ouls they had to play upon.</P>
<P>But that at la&s;t your mamma (tired with and per|haps a&s;hamed of the pa&s;&s;ive part &s;he had acted) thought fit to declare to Mi&s;s Bell, that &s;he was deter|mined to try to put an end to the family-feuds; and to get your uncle Harlowe to &s;econd her endeavours.</P>
<P>This alarmed your brother and &s;i&s;ter; and then a change of mea&s;ures was re&s;olved upon. Solmes's of|fers were however too advantageous to be given up; and your father's conde&s;cen&s;ion was now to be their &s;ole dependence, and (as they give out) your la&s;t trial.</P>
<P>And, indeed, my dear, this mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded, I verily think, with &s;uch a daughter as they had to deal with, could that father, who never, I dare &s;ay, kneeled in his life, but to God, have &s;o far conde|&s;cended, as your aunt writes he would.</P>
<P>But then, my dear, what would this have done?&mdash;Perhaps you would have given Lovelace the meeting, in hopes to pacify him, and prevent mi&s;chief; &s;up|po&s;ing that they had given you time, and not hurried you directly into the &s;tate. But if you had not met him, you &s;ee, that he was re&s;olved to vi&s;it them, and well attended too: And what mu&s;t have been the con|&s;equence?</P>
<P>So that, upon the whole, we know not but matters may be be&s;t as they <HI>are,</HI> however unde&s;irable that <HI>be&s;t</HI> is.</P>
<P>I hope your con&s;iderate and thoughtful mind will make a good u&s;e of this hint. Who would not with patience &s;u&s;tain even a great evil, if &s;he could per|&s;uade
<PB N="273" REF="274">
her&s;elf, that it was kindly di&s;pen&s;ed, in or|der to prevent a <HI>&s;till</HI> greater?&mdash;E&s;pecial]y, if &s;he could &s;it down, as you can, and acquit her own heart?</P>
<P>Permit me one further ob&s;ervation&mdash;Do we not &s;ee, from the above &s;tate of the matter, what might have been done before, by <HI>the worthy per&s;on</HI> of your fa|mily, had &s;he exerted the <HI>mother,</HI> in behalf of a child &s;o meritorious, yet &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ed?</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Harlowe, <HI>in her an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the two la&s;t letters, chides her friend for giving &s;o little weight to her advice, in relation to her behaviour to her mother:&mdash;It may be proper to in&s;ert here the following extracts from that an&s;wer; tho' a little before their time.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I will not repeat, &s;ays &s;ee, what I have before written in Mr. Hickman's behalf. I will only re|mind you of an ob&s;ervation I have made to you more than once, that you have outlived your fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; and had the &s;econd man been an angel, he would not have been more than indifferent to you.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My motives for &s;u&s;pending, <HI>proceeds &s;he,</HI> were not merely ceremonious ones. I was really very ill. I could not hold up my head. The contents of my &s;i&s;ters letters had pierced my heart. And was I, my dear, to be as ready to accept his offer, as if I were afraid, he never would repeat it?'</Q></P>
<P><HI>To the &s;econd letter, among other things, &s;he &s;ays:</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'So, my dear, you &s;eem to think, that there was a fate in my error. The cordial, the con&s;idering friend, is &s;een in the ob&s;ervation you make on this occa&s;ion. Yet &s;ince things have happen'd as they have, would to heaven I could hear, that all the world acquitted my father, or, at lea&s;t, my mo|ther;
<PB N="274" REF="275">
for her character, before the&s;e family-feuds broke out, was every-one's admiration. Don't let any-body &s;ay from you, &s;o that it may come to <HI>her</HI> ear, that &s;he might, by a timely exertion of her fine talents, have &s;aved her unhappy child. You'll ob&s;erve, my dear, that in her own good time, when &s;he &s;aw that there was not likely to be an end to my brother's per&s;ecutions, &s;he was re&s;olved to exert her&s;elf. But the pragmatical daughter, by the fa|tal meeting, precipitated all, and fru&s;trated her in|dulgent de&s;igns. O my dear, I am now convinced, by dear experience, that while children are &s;o happy as to have parents or guardians, whom they <HI>may</HI> con&s;ult, they &s;hould not pre&s;ume (no, not with the be&s;t and pure&s;t intentions) to follow their own con|ceits, in material ca&s;es.'</Q></P>

It will behove me, perhaps, to apply to that dear uncle, if a proper occa&s;ion offer.'</Q></P>

<P>FATE is weaving a whim&s;ical web for thy friend; and I &s;ee not but I &s;hall be inevitably manacled.</P>
<P>Here have I been at work, dig, dig, dig, like a cunning miner, at one time, and &s;preading my &s;nares, like an artful fowler, at another, and exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature ab|&s;olutely into my power;&mdash;Every thing made for me.
<PB N="275" REF="276">
&mdash;Her brother and uncle were but my pioneers: Her father &s;torm'd as I directed him to &s;torm. Mrs. Howe was acted by the &s;prings I &s;et at work: Her daughter was moving for me, and yet imagin'd her&s;elf plumb again&s;t me: And the dear creature her&s;elf had already run her &s;tubborn neck into my gin, and knew not that &s;he was caught; for I had not drawn my &s;prindges clo&s;e about her.&mdash;And ju&s;t as all this was completed, would&s;t thou believe, that I &s;hould be my own ene|my, and her friend?&mdash;That I &s;hould be &s;o totally di|verted from all my favourite purpo&s;es, as to propo&s;e to marry her before I went to town, in order to put it out of my own power to re&s;ume them?</P>
<P>When thou knowe&s;t This, wilt thou not think that my black angel plays me booty, and has taken it into his head, to urge me on to the indi&s;&s;oluble tie, that he might be more &s;ure of me (from the complex tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions to which he will certainly &s;timulate me, when wedded) than perhaps he thought he could be from the &s;imple &s;ins, in which I have &s;o long allowed my&s;elf, that they &s;eem to have the plea of habit?</P>
<P>Thou wilt be &s;till the more &s;urprized, when I tell thee, that there &s;eems to be a coalition going forward between the black angels and the white ones; for here has hers induced her in one hour, and by one re|trograde accident, to <HI>acknowlege</HI> what the charming creature never before acknowleged, a preferable fa|vour for me. She even owns an intention to be mine;&mdash;Mine, without reformation-conditions:&mdash;She per|mits me to talk of love to her: Of the irrevocable ce|remony: Yet, another extraordinary! po&s;tpones that ceremony; choo&s;es to &s;et out for London; and even to go to the widow's in town.</P>
<P>Well, but how comes all this about, methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t?&mdash;Thou, Lovelace, deale&s;t in wonders, yet aime&s;t not at the <HI>Marvellous.</HI>&mdash;How did all this come about?</P>
<P>I'll tell thee&mdash;I was in danger of lo&s;ing my charmer
<PB N="276" REF="277">
for ever.&mdash;She was &s;oaring upward to her native &s;kies. She was got above earth, by means, too, of the <HI>Earth-born:</HI> And &s;omething extraordinary was to be done to keep her with us Sublunaries. And what &s;o effectually as the &s;oothing voice of Love, and the at|tracting offer of Matrimony from a man not hated, can fix the attention of the maiden heart aking with uncertainty; and before impatient of the que&s;tionable que&s;tion?</P>
<P>This, in &s;hort, was the ca&s;e.&mdash;While &s;he was re|fu&s;ing all manner of obligation to me, keeping me at haughty di&s;tance; in hopes that her cou&s;in Morden's arrival would &s;oon fix her in a full and ab&s;olute inde|pendence of me: Di&s;gu&s;ted likewi&s;e at her adorer, for holding him&s;elf the reins of his own pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;tead of giving them up to her controul:&mdash;She writes a letter, urging an an&s;wer to a letter before written, for her apparel, her jewels, and &s;ome gold, which &s;he had left behind her; all which was to &s;ave her pride from obligation, and to promote the independence her heart was &s;et upon.&mdash;And what follow'd but a &s;hocking an&s;wer, made &s;till more &s;hocking by the communi|cation of a paternal cur&s;e upon a daughter, de&s;erving only ble&s;&s;ings?&mdash;A cur&s;e upon the cur&s;er's heart, and a double one upon the tran&s;mitter's, the &s;piteful, the envious Arabella!</P>
<P>Ab&s;ent when it came; on my return, I found her, recovering from fits, again to fall into &s;tronger fits; and no-body expecting her life; half a dozen me&s;&s;en|gers di&s;patch'd to find me out.&mdash;Nor wonder at her being &s;o affected; &s;he, who&s;e filial piety gave her dread|ful faith in a father's cur&s;es; and the cur&s;e of this gloomy tyrant extending, to u&s;e her own words, when &s;he could &s;peak, <HI>to both worlds.</HI>&mdash;O that it had turn'd, in the moment of its utterance, to a mortal quin&s;ey, and &s;ticking in his gullet, had choak'd the old exe|crator, as a warning to all &s;uch unnatural fathers.</P>
<P>What a mi&s;creant had I been, not to have endea|voured
<PB N="277" REF="278">
to bring her back, by all the endearments, by all the vows, by all the offers that I could make her?</P>
<P>I did bring her back. More than a father to her; for I have given her a life her unnatural father had well-nigh taken away; &s;hall I not cheri&s;h the fruits of my own benefaction?&mdash;I have been in earne&s;t in my vows to marry, and my ardour to urge the pre|&s;ent time was a <HI>real</HI> ardour. But extreme dejection, with a mingled delicacy, that in her dying moments I doubt not &s;he will pre&s;erve, have cau&s;ed her to refu&s;e me the <HI>time,</HI> tho' not the &s;olemnity; for &s;he has told me, that now &s;he mu&s;t be wholly in my protection, <HI>being de&s;titute of every other!</HI>&mdash;More indebted &s;till, thou &s;ee&s;t, to her cruel friends, than to her&s;elf, for her favour!</P>
<P>She has written to Mi&s;s Howe an account of their barbarity; but has not acquainted her, how very ill &s;he was.</P>
<P>Low, very low, &s;he remains; yet, dreading her &s;tupid brother's enterprize, &s;he wants to be in Lon|don: Where, but for <HI>this</HI> accident, and (would&s;t thou have believed it?) my per&s;ua&s;ions, &s;eeing her &s;o very ill, &s;he would have been this night; and we &s;hall actually &s;et out on Wedne&s;day morning, if &s;he be not wor&s;e.</P>
<P>And now for a few words with thee, on thy heavy preachment of Saturday la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thou art apprehen&s;ive, that the Lady is now in danger indeed; and it is a miracle thou telle&s;t me, if &s;he &s;tand &s;uch an attempter:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Knowing what we know of the &s;ex, thou &s;aye&s;t, thou &s;hould&s;t dread, wert thou me, to make farther trial, le&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ucceed.'</Q>
And, in another place, telle&s;t me,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That thou pleade&s;t not for the &s;tate, for any favour thou ha&s;t for it.'</Q></P>
<P>What an advocate art thou for matrimony!&mdash;Thou wert ever an unhappy fellow at argument. Does the
<PB N="278" REF="279">
trite &s;tuff with which the re&s;t of thy letter abounds, in <HI>favour</HI> of wedlock, &s;trike with the force that this does <HI>again&s;t</HI> it?</P>
<P>Thou take&s;t great pains to convince me, and that from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es the Lady is reduced to [chiefly by her friends per&s;ecutions and implacablene&s;s, I hope thou wilt own, and not from me as yet], that the propo&s;ed trial will not be a fair trial. But let me a&s;k thee, Is not calamity the te&s;t of virtue? And would&s;t thou not have me value this charming creature upon proof of her merits?&mdash;Do I not intend to reward her by marriage, if &s;he &s;tand that proof?</P>
<P>But why repeat I, what I have &s;aid before?&mdash;Turn back, thou egregious arguer, turn back to my long letter of the 13th <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>xvii.</HI> p. <HI>103.</HI> to <HI>113.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>; and thou wilt there find every &s;yllable of what thou ha&s;t written, either an&s;wer'd or invalidated.</P>
<P>But I am not angry with thee, Jack. I love op|po&s;ition. As gold is try'd by fire, and virtue by temptation; &s;o is &s;terling wit by oppo&s;ition. Have I not, before thou &s;etted&s;t out as an advocate for my fair one, often brought thee in, as making objections to my proceedings, for no other rea&s;on than to exalt my&s;elf by proving thee a man of &s;traw? As Homer rai&s;es up many of his champions, and gives them terrible names, only to have them knock'd on the head by his heroes.</P>
<P>However, take to thee this one piece of advice&mdash;Evermore be &s;ure of being in the right, when thou pre&s;ume&s;t to &s;it down to correct thy ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Well, but to return to my principal &s;ubject; let me ob&s;erve, that be my future re&s;olutions what they will, as to this lady, the contents of the violent letter &s;he has received, have &s;et me at lea&s;t a month forward with her. I can now, as I hinted, talk of Love and Marriage, without controul or re&s;triction; her in|junctions no more my terror.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">In this &s;weetly familiar way &s;hall we &s;et out together for London. Mrs. Sorlings's elde&s;t daughter, at my motion, is to attend her in the chai&s;e; while I ride by way of e&s;corte: For &s;he is extremely apprehen&s;ive of the Singleton plot; and has engag'd me to be all patience, if any thing &s;hould happen on the road. But nothing I am &s;ure <HI>will</HI> happen: For, by a letter re|ceived ju&s;t now from Jo&s;eph, I under&s;tand, that James Harlowe has already laid a&s;ide his &s;tupid project: And This by the earne&s;t de&s;ire of all his friends to whom he had communicated it; who were afraid of the con&s;equences that might attend it. But it is not over with <HI>me,</HI> however; altho' I am not determin'd at pre&s;ent, as to the u&s;es I may make of it.</P>
<P>My beloved tells me, &s;he &s;hall have her cloaths &s;ent her: She hopes al&s;o her jewels, and &s;ome gold, which &s;he left behind her. But Jo&s;eph &s;ays, cloaths <HI>only</HI> will be &s;ent. I will not, however, tell her that: On the contrary, I &s;ay, there is no doubt, but they will &s;end <HI>all</HI> &s;he wrote for, of per&s;onals. The greater her di&s;appointment from them, the greater mu&s;t be her dependence on me.</P>
<P>But, after all, I hope I &s;hall be enabled to be hone&s;t to a merit &s;o tran&s;cendent. The devil take thee tho', for thy opinion given &s;o mal-&agrave;-propo', that &s;he may be overcome.</P>
<P>If thou de&s;igne&s;t to be hone&s;t, methinks thou &s;ay'&s;t, why &s;hould not Singleton's plot be over with <HI>thee,</HI> as it is with her <HI>brother?</HI></P>
<P>Becau&s;e, if I mu&s;t an&s;wer thee, where people are &s;o mode&s;tly doubtful of what they are able to do, it is good to leave a loop-hole. And let me add, that when a man's heart is &s;et upon a point, and any thing occurs to beat him off, he will find it is very difficult, when the &s;u&s;pending rea&s;on cea&s;es, to forbear re|&s;umng it.</P>

<P>ALL hands at work in preparation for London. What makes my heart beat &s;o &s;trong? Why ri&s;es it to my throat, in &s;uch half-choaking flutters, when I think of what this removal may do for me?&mdash;I am hitherto re&s;olv'd to be hone&s;t: And that increa&s;es my wonder at the&s;e involuntary commotions. 'Tis a plotting villain of a heart: It ever was; and ever will be, I doubt. Such a joy when any roguery is going forward!&mdash;I &s;o little its ma&s;ter!&mdash;A head likewi&s;e &s;o well turn'd to an&s;wer the triangular varlet's impul&s;es. No matter. I will have one &s;truggle with thee, old friend; and if I cannot overcome thee now, I never will again attempt to conquer thee.</P>
<P>The dear creature continues extremely low and de|jected. Tender blo&s;&s;om! How unfit to contend with the rude and ruffling winds of pa&s;&s;ion, and haughty and in&s;olent controul!&mdash;Never till now from under the wing (it is not enough to &s;ay of indulging, but) of <HI>admiring</HI> parents; the mother's bo&s;om only fit to re|ceive this charming flower!</P>
<P>This was the reflection, that, with mingled com|pa&s;&s;ion, and augmented love, aro&s;e to my mind, when I beheld the charmer repo&s;ing her lovely face upon the bo&s;om of the widow Sorlings, from a reco|ver'd fit, as I enter'd, &s;oon after &s;he had received her execrable &s;i&s;ter's letter. How lovely in her tears!&mdash;And as I enter'd, her lifted-up face, &s;ignificantly be|&s;peaking my protection, as I thought. And can I be a villain to &s;uch an angel!&mdash;I hope not.&mdash;But why, once more, thou varlet, putte&s;t thou me in mind, that &s;he <HI>may be</HI> overcome? And why is her own re|liance on my honour &s;o late, and &s;o reluctantly &s;hewn?</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="282">But, after all, &s;o low, &s;o dejected, continues &s;he to be, that I am terribly afraid I &s;hall have a va|pouri&s;h wife, if I <HI>do</HI> marry. I &s;hould then be doubly undone. Not that I &s;hall be much at home with her, perhaps, after the fir&s;t fortnight, or &s;o. But when a man has been ranging, like the painful bee, from flower to flower, perhaps for a month together, and the thoughts of Home and a Wife begin to have their charms with him, to be received by a Niobe, who, like a wounded vine, weeps its vitals away, while it but involuntarily curls about you; how &s;hall I be able to bear That?</P>
<P>May heaven re&s;tore my charmer to health and &s;pi|rits, I hourly pray, that a man may &s;ee whether &s;he can love any body but her father and mother! In <HI>their</HI> power, I am confident, it will be at any time, to make her hu&s;band joyle&s;s; and that, as I hate them &s;o heartily, is a &s;hocking thing to reflect upon: Some|thing <HI>more</HI> than woman, an <HI>angel,</HI> in &s;ome things, but a <HI>baby</HI> in others: So father-&s;ick! &s;o family-fond! what a poor chance &s;tands a hu&s;band with &s;uch a wife, unle&s;s, for&s;ooth, they vouch&s;afe to be reconciled to her, and <HI>continue</HI> reconciled?</P>
<P>It is infinitely better for her and for me, that we &s;hould not marry!&mdash;What a delightful manner of life (O that I could per&s;uade her to it!) would that be with &s;uch a lady! The fears, the inquietudes, the unea&s;y days, the re&s;tle&s;s nights; all ari&s;ing from doubts of having di&s;obliged me! Every ab&s;ence dreaded to be an ab&s;ence for ever! And then, how amply rewarded, and rewarding, by the rapture-cau&s;ing return! Such a pa&s;&s;ion as this, keeps Love in a continual fervour; makes it all alive. The happy pair, in&s;tead of &s;itting, dozing, and nodding at each other in two oppo&s;ite chimney-corners, in a winter-evening, and over a wintry love, always new to each other, and having always &s;omething to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="283">Thou knowe&s;t, in my ver&s;es to my Stella, my mind on this occa&s;ion. I will lay tho&s;e ver&s;es in her way, as if unde&s;ignedly, when we are together at the wi|dow's; that is to &s;ay, if we do not &s;oon go to church by con&s;ent: She will thence &s;ee what my notions are of wedlock. If &s;he receives them with any &s;ort of temper, that will be a foundation; and let <HI>me</HI> alone to build upon it.</P>
<P>Many a girl has been <HI>carried,</HI> who never would have been <HI>attempted,</HI> had &s;he &s;hewed a proper re&s;ent|ment, when her ears or her eyes were fir&s;t invaded. I have try'd a young creature by a bad book, a light quotation, or an indecent picture; and if &s;he has borne that, or only blu&s;h'd, and not been angry, and more-e&s;pecially if &s;he has leer'd and &s;mil'd, that girl have I, and old Mulciber, put down for our own. O how I could warn the&s;e little rogues if I would! Perhaps envy, more than virtue, will put me upon &s;etting up beacons for them, when I grow old and joyle&s;s.</P>

<P>IF you are in London when I get thither, you will &s;ee me &s;oon.&mdash;My charmer is a little better than &s;he was. Her eyes &s;hew it, and her harmonious voice, hardly audible la&s;t time I &s;aw her, now begins to chear my heart once more. But yet &s;he has no love, no &s;en&s;ibility!&mdash;There is no addre&s;&s;ing her with tho&s;e <HI>meaning,</HI> yet <HI>innocent</HI> freedoms [innocent, at fir&s;t &s;et|ting out, they may be called] which &s;often others of her &s;ex. The more &s;trange this, as &s;he now acknow|leges preferable favour for me; and is highly &s;u&s;ce|ptible of grief. Grief mollifies and enervates. The grieved mind looks round it, &s;ilently implores con&s;o|lation, and loves the &s;oother. Grief is ever an inmate with Joy. Tho' they won't &s;hew them&s;elves at the &s;ame window at <HI>one</HI> time; yet have they the whole hou&s;e in common between them.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedn. Apr. 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT la&s;t, my lucky &s;tar has directed us into the de&s;ired port, and we are &s;afely landed. Well &s;ays Rowe:
<Q><L>The wi&s;e and active conquer difficulties</L>
<L>By daring to attempt them. Sloth and folly</L>
<L>Shiver and &s;hrink at &s;ight of toil and hazard,</L>
<L>And <HI>make</HI> th' impo&s;&s;ibility they <HI>fear.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of my exultation, &s;omething, I know not what to call it, checks my joys, and glooms over my brighter pro&s;pects. If it be not con&s;cience, it is wondrou&s;ly like what I thought &s;o, many, many years ago.</P>
<P>Surely, Lovelace, methinks thou &s;ay&s;t, thy good motions are not gone off already! Surely thou wilt not now at la&s;t be a villain to this lady.</P>
<P>I can't tell what to &s;ay to it.&mdash;Why would not the dear creature accept of me, when I &s;o &s;incerely offer'd my&s;elf to her acceptance? Things already appear with a very different face now I have got her here. Already have our mother and her daughters been about me.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Charming Lady! What a complexion! What eyes! What maje&s;ty in her per&s;on!&mdash;O Mr. Lovelace, you are a happy man!&mdash;You owe us &s;uch a Lady!'</Q>
&mdash;Then they remind me of my re|venge, and of my hatred to her whole family. Sally was &s;o &s;truck with her, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that &s;he broke out to me in tho&s;e lines of Dryden:
<Q><L>&mdash;Fairer to be &s;een</L>
<L>Than the fair lily on the flow'ry green!</L>
<L>More fre&s;h than May her&s;elf in blo&s;&s;oms new!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285">I &s;ent to thy lodgings within half an hour after our arrival, to receive thy congratulations upon it: But thou wert at Edgware, it &s;eems.</P>
<P>My beloved, who is charmingly amended, is re|tired to her con&s;tant employment, writing. I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with the &s;ame amu&s;ement, till &s;he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to admit me to her pre&s;ence: Having already given to every one her cue.</P>
<P>But here comes the widow, with Dorcas Wykes in her hand.&mdash;Dorcas Wykes, Jack, is to be the maid-&s;ervant to my fair-one; and I am to introduce them both to her. In &s;o many ways will it be in my power to have the dear creature now, that I &s;hall not know which of them to choo&s;e!&mdash;</P>
<P>So! The hone&s;t girl is accepted!&mdash;Of good pa|rentage: But, thro' a neglected education, plaguy illiterate:&mdash;She can neither write, nor read writing. A kin&s;woman of Mrs. Sinclair's: So could not well be refu&s;ed, the widow in per&s;on recommending her; and the wench only taken till her Hannah can come. What an advantage has an impo&s;ing or forward nature over a courteous one!&mdash;So here may &s;omething ari&s;e to lead into corre&s;pondencies, and &s;o forth!&mdash;To be &s;ure, a per&s;on need not be &s;o wary, &s;o cautious of what &s;he writes, or what &s;he leaves upon her table or toilet, when her attendant cannot read.</P>
<P>Dorcas is a neat girl both in per&s;on and dre&s;s; a countenance not vulgar. And I am in hopes that &s;he accept of her for her bedfellow, in a&s;trange hou&s;e, for a week or &s;o. But I &s;aw &s;he had a di&s;like to her at her very fir&s;t appearance:&mdash;Yet I thought the girl behaved very mode&s;tly&mdash;Over-did it a little per|haps!&mdash;She &s;hrunk back, and looked &s;hy upon her. The doctrine of &s;ympathies and antipathies is a &s;ur|pri&s;ing doctrine.&mdash;But Dorcas will be exce&s;&s;ively ob|liging, and win her Lady's favour &s;oon, I doubt not.&mdash;I am &s;ecure in her <HI>incorruptibility.</HI> A great
<PB N="285" REF="286">
point that!&mdash;For a Lady and her Maid of one party will be too hard for half a &s;core devils.</P>
<P>The dear creature was no le&s;s &s;hy when the widow fir&s;t acco&s;ted her, at her alighting. Yet, I thought, that hone&s;t Doleman's letter had prepared her for her ma&s;culine appearance.</P>
<P>And now I mention that letter, why do&s;t thou not wi&s;h me joy, Jack?</P>
<P>Joy of what?</P>
<P>Why, joy of my nuptials.&mdash;Know then, that <HI>&s;aid,</HI> is <HI>done</HI> with me, when I have a mind to have it &s;o; and that we are actually man and wife. Only that con&s;ummation has not pa&s;&s;ed: Bound down to the contrary of that, by a &s;olemn vow, till a reconcilia|tion with her family take place. The women here are told &s;o. They know it, before my beloved knows it; and that's odd, thou'lt &s;ay.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall I do to make my fair-one temperate on the intimation? Why is &s;he not here?&mdash;At Mrs. Sinclair's?&mdash;But if &s;he will hear rea&s;on, I doubt not to convince her, that &s;he ought to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>She will in&s;i&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon my leaving her, and that I &s;hall not take up my lodgings under the &s;ame roof. But circum&s;tances are changed &s;ince I fir&s;t made her that promi&s;e. I have taken all the vacant apartments; and mu&s;t carry this point al&s;o.</P>
<P>I hope in a while to get her with me to the public entertainments. She knows nothing of the town, and has &s;een le&s;s of its diver&s;ions than ever woman of her ta&s;te, her fortune, her endowments, did &s;ee. She has indeed a natural politene&s;s, which tran&s;cends all acquirement. The mo&s;t capable of any one I ever knew, of judging what an <HI>hundred</HI> things are, by &s;ee|ing <HI>one</HI> of a like nature. Indeed &s;he took &s;o much plea&s;ure in her own cho&s;en amu&s;ements till per&s;ecuted out of them, that &s;he had neither lei&s;ure nor inclina|tion for the town diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e diver&s;ions will amu&s;e. And the duce is in
<PB N="286" REF="287">
it, if a little &s;u&s;ceptibility will not put forth, now &s;he receives my addre&s;s, and if I can manage it &s;o, as to be allowed to live under <HI>one</HI> roof with her. What tho' the appearance be at fir&s;t no more than that of an early &s;pring-flower in fro&s;ty weather, that &s;eems afraid of being nipp'd by an ea&s;terly bla&s;t; that will be enough for me.</P>
<P>I hinted to thee in a former <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> xxxvii. <HI>p.</HI> 192.</NOTE>, that I had pro|vided for the lady's in-door amu&s;ement. Sally and Polly are readers. My beloved's light clo&s;et was their library. And &s;everal pieces of devotion have been put in, bought on purpo&s;e, at &s;econd-hand.</P>
<P>I was always for forming a judgment of the reading part of the &s;ex by their books. The ob&s;ervations I have made on this occa&s;ion have been of great u&s;e to me, as well in England as out of it. This &s;agacious lady may po&s;&s;ibly be as curious in this point, as her Lovelace.</P>
<P>So much for the pre&s;ent. Thou &s;ee&s;t, that I have a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s before me. Yet I will write again &s;oon.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Lovelace &s;ends another letter with this; in which he takes notice of young Mrs. Sorlings's &s;et|ting out with them, and leaving them at Barnet: But as its contents are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e in the lady's next, it is omitted.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedn. P. M. Apr. 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT length, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, I am in Lon|don, and in my new lodgings. They are neatly furni&s;h'd, and the &s;ituation, for the town, is plea&s;ant. But, I think, you mu&s;t not a&s;k me, how I like the old gentlewoman. Yet &s;he &s;eems courteous and ob|liging. Her kin&s;women ju&s;t appeared to welcome me
<PB N="287" REF="288">
at my alighting. They &s;eem to be genteel young women. But more of their aunt and of them, as I &s;hall &s;ee more.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Sorlings has an uncle at Barnet, whom &s;he found &s;o very ill, that her unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;tay to attend him (having large expectations from him) made me comply with her de&s;ire. Yet I wi&s;h'd, as her uncle did not expect her, that &s;he would fir&s;t &s;ee me &s;ettled in London; and Mr. Lovelace was &s;till more earne&s;t that &s;he would, offering to &s;end her back again in a day or two, and urging, that her uncle's malady inti|mated not a &s;udden change. But leaving the matter to her choice, after &s;he knew what would have been mine, &s;he made me not the expected compliment up|on it. Mr. Lovelace, however, made her a hand|&s;ome pre&s;ent at parting.</P>
<P>His genteel &s;pirit on all occa&s;ions makes me often wi&s;h him more con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived, I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my apart|ment. Shall make good u&s;e of the light clo&s;et in it, if I &s;tay here any time.</P>
<P>One of his attendants returns in the morning to the Lawn; and I made writing to you by him, an ex|cu&s;e for my retiring.</P>
<P>And now give me leave to chide you, my deare&s;t friend, for your ra&s;h, and I hope revocable re&s;olution, not to make Mr. Hickman the happie&s;t man in the world, while my happine&s;s is in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Suppo&s;e I were to be unhappy, what, my dear, would your re|&s;olution avail me? Marriage is the highe&s;t &s;tate of friend&s;hip: If happy, it le&s;&s;ens our cares, by divide|ing them, at the &s;ame time that it doubles our plea|&s;ures by a mutual participation. Why, my dear, if you love me, will you not rather give another friend to one who has not two that &s;he is &s;ure of?&mdash;Had you marry'd on your mother's la&s;t birth-day, as &s;he would have had you, I &s;hould not, I dare &s;ay,
<PB N="288" REF="289">
have wanted a refuge, that would have &s;aved me &s;o many mortifications, and &s;o much di&s;grace.</P>
<P>HERE I was broken in upon by Mr. Lovelace; introducing the widow leading in a kin&s;woman of hers to attend me, if I approved of her, till my Hannah &s;hould come, or till I had provided my&s;elf with &s;ome other &s;ervant. The widow gave her many good qua|lities; but &s;aid, that &s;he had one great defect; which was, that &s;he could not write, nor read writing; that part of her education having been neglected when &s;he was young: But for di&s;cretion, fidelity, obligingne&s;s, &s;he was not to be outdone by any-body. She com|mended her likewi&s;e for her &s;kill in the needle.</P>
<P>As for her defect, I can ea&s;ily forgive that. She is very likely and genteel; too genteel indeed, I think, for a &s;ervant. But what I like lea&s;t of all in her, &s;he has a &s;trange &s;ly eye. I never &s;aw &s;uch an eye:&mdash;Half-confident, I think. But indeed Mrs. Sinclair her&s;elf (for that is the widow's name) has an odd winking eye; and her re&s;pectfulne&s;s &s;eems too much &s;tudied, methinks, for the London ea&s;e and freedom. But people can't help their looks, you know; and after all, &s;he is extremely civil and obliging: And as for the young woman (Dorcas her name), &s;he will not be long with me.</P>
<P>I accepted her: How could I do otherwi&s;e (if I had a mind to make objections, which in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion I had not), her aunt pre&s;ent, and the young wo|man al&s;o pre&s;ent; and Mr. Lovelace officious in his introducing of them for my &s;ake?&mdash;But upon their leaving me, I told him, who &s;eem'd inclinable to be|gin a conver&s;ation with me, that I de&s;ired that this apartment might be con&s;ider'd as my retirement: That when I &s;aw him, it might be in the dining-room; and that I might be as little broke in upon as po&s;&s;ible, when I am here. He withdrew very re&s;pect|fully to the door; but there &s;topt; and a&s;ked for my
<PB N="289" REF="290">
company then in the dining-room. If he was about &s;etting out for other lodgings, I would go with him now, I told him: But if he did not ju&s;t then go, I would fir&s;t fini&s;h my letter to Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>I &s;ee he has no mind to leave me, if he can help it. My brother's &s;cheme may give him a pretence to try to engage me to di&s;pen&s;e with his promi&s;e. But if I now do, I mu&s;t acquit him of it intirely.</P>
<P>My approbation of his tender behaviour in the mid&s;t of my grief, has given him a right, as he &s;eems to think, of addre&s;&s;ing me with all the freedom of an approved lover. I &s;ee by this man, that when once a woman embarks with this &s;ex, there is no re|ceding. One conce&s;&s;ion is but the prelude to an|other with them. He has been ever &s;ince Sunday la&s;t continually complaining of the di&s;tance I keep him at; and thinks him&s;elf intitled now, to call in que&s;tion my value for him; &s;trengthening his doubts by my de|clared readine&s;s to give him up to a reconciliation with my friends&mdash;And yet has him&s;elf fallen off from that <HI>ob&s;equious tenderne&s;s,</HI> if I may couple the words, which drew from me the conce&s;&s;ions he builds upon.</P>
<P>While we were talking at the door, my new &s;er|vant came up, with an invitation to us both to tea. I &s;aid <HI>he</HI> might accept of it, if he plea&s;ed; but I mu&s;t pur&s;ue my writing; and not choo&s;ing either tea or &s;upper, I de&s;ired him to make my excu&s;es below, as to both; and inform them of my choice to be retired as much as po&s;&s;ible; yet to promi&s;e for me my at|tendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfa&s;t in the morning.</P>
<P>He objected particularity in the eye of &s;trangers, as to avoiding &s;upper.</P>
<P>You know, &s;aid I, and can tell them, that I &s;el|dom eat &s;uppers. My &s;pirits are low. You mu&s;t never urge me again&s;t a declared choice. Pray, Mr. Lovelace, inform them of all my particularities. If
<PB N="290" REF="291">
they are obliging, they will allow for them. I come not here to make new acquaintance.</P>
<P>I have turned over the books I have found in my clo&s;et; and am not a little plea&s;ed with them; and think the better of the people of the hou&s;e for their &s;akes.</P>
<P>Stanhope's Go&s;pels; Sharp's, Tillot&s;on's, and South's Sermons; Nel&s;on's Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts; a Sa|cramental piece of the Bi&s;hop of Man, and another of Dr. Gauden, Bi&s;hop of Exeter; and Inett's De|votions; are among the devout books: And among tho&s;e of a lighter turn, the&s;e not ill-cho&s;en ones; A Telemachus in French, another in Engli&s;h; Steele's, Rowe's, and Shake&s;peare's Plays; that genteel Co|medy of Mr. Cibber, The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band, and others of the &s;ame Author; Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies; the Tattlers, Spectators, and Guardians; Pope's, and Swift's, and Addi&s;on's Works.</P>
<P>In the blank leaves of the Nel&s;on and Bi&s;hop Gau|den, is Mrs. Sinclair's name; in tho&s;e of mo&s;t of the others, either Sarah Martin, or Mary Horton, the names of the two nieces.</P>
<P>I AM exceedingly out of humour with Mr. Love|lace: And have great rea&s;on to be &s;o: As you will allow, when you have read the conver&s;ation I am going to give you an account of; for he would not let me re&s;t till I gave him my company in the dining-room.</P>
<P>He began with letting me know, that he had been out to inquire after the character of the widow; which was the more nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, as he &s;uppo&s;ed that I would <HI>expect</HI> his frequent ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I did, I &s;aid; and that he would not think of taking up his lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e with me. But what was the i&s;&s;ue of his inquiry?</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292">Why, indeed, it was, in the main, what he liked well enough. But as it was Mi&s;s Howe's opinion, as I had told him, that my brother had not given over his &s;cheme; as the widow lived by letting lodgings; and had others to let in the &s;ame part of the hou&s;e, which might be taken by an enemy; he knew no better way, than for him to take them all, as it could not be for a long time; unle&s;s I would think of re|moving to others.</P>
<P>So far was well enough: But as it was ea&s;y for me to &s;ee, that he &s;poke the &s;lighter of the widow, in order to have a pretence to lodge here him&s;elf, I a&s;ked him his intention in that re&s;pect. And he frankly own'd, that if I cho&s;e to &s;tay here, he could not, as matters &s;tood, think of leaving me for &s;ix hours together; and he had prepared the widow, to expect, that we &s;hould be here but for a few days;&mdash;only till we could fix our&s;elves in a hou&s;e &s;uitable to our condition; and this, that I might be under the le&s;s embarra&s;s, if I plea&s;ed to remove.</P>
<P>Fix <HI>our</HI>-&s;elves in a hou&s;e, and <HI>we</HI> and <HI>our,</HI> Mr. Lovelace&mdash;Pray, in what light&mdash;</P>
<P>He interrupted me,&mdash;Why, my deare&s;t life, if you will hear me with patience&mdash;Yet I am half afraid, that I have been too forward, as I have not con&s;ulted you upon it.&mdash;But as my friends in town, according to what Mr. Doleman has written, in the letter you have &s;een, conclude us to be marry'd&mdash;</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, you have not pre&s;umed&mdash;</P>
<P>Hear me out, deare&s;t creature&mdash;You have received with favour my addre&s;&s;es&mdash;You have made me hope for the honour of your con&s;enting hand: Yet, by de|clining my mo&s;t fervent tender of my&s;elf to you at Mrs. Sorlings's, have given me apprehen&s;ions of delay: I would not for the world be thought &s;o ungenerous a wretch, now you have honoured me with your confi|dence, as to wi&s;h to precipitate you: Yet your brother's &s;chemes are not given up. Singleton, I am afraid, is
<PB N="292" REF="293">
actually in town; his ve&s;&s;el lies at Rotherhith&mdash;Your brother is ab&s;ent from Harlowe-Place [indeed not with Singleton yet, as I can hear]. If you are <HI>known</HI> to be mine, or if you are but <HI>thought</HI> to be &s;o, there will probably be an end of your brother's contrivances. The widow's character may be as worthy as it is &s;aid to be. But the worthier &s;he is, the more danger, if your brother's agent &s;hould find us out; &s;ince &s;he may be per&s;uaded, that &s;he ought in con&s;cience to take a parent's part, again&s;t a child who &s;tands in op|po&s;ition to them. But if &s;he believes us married, her good character will &s;tand us in &s;tead, and &s;he will be of our party.&mdash;Then I have taken care to give her a rea&s;on why two apartments are requi&s;ite for us, at the hour of retirement.</P>
<P>I perfectly raved at him. I would have flung from him in re&s;entment; but he would not let me: And what could I do? Whither go, the evening ad|vanced?</P>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;h'd at you! &s;aid I:&mdash;If you are a man of honour, what need of all this &s;trange obliquity? You delight in crooked ways.&mdash;Let me know, &s;ince I mu&s;t &s;tay in your company (for he held my hand), let me know all you have &s;aid.&mdash;Indeed, indeed, Mr. Lovelace, you are a very unaccountable man.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t creature, need I to have mentioned any thing of this; and could I not have taken up my lodg|ings in this hou&s;e, unknown to you, if I had not in|tended to make you the judge of all my proceedings?&mdash;But this is what I have told the widow before her kin&s;women, and before your new &s;ervant,&mdash;That in|deed we were privately married at Hertford; but that you had preliminarily bound me under a &s;olemn vow, which I am mo&s;t religiou&s;ly re&s;olved to keep, to be contented with &s;eparate apartments, and even not to lodge under the &s;ame roof, till a certain reconciliation &s;hall take place, which is of high con&s;equence to both. And further, that I might convince you of the purity
<PB N="293" REF="294">
of my intentions, and that my whole view in this was to prevent mi&s;chief, I have acquainted them, that I have &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to behave to you before every body, as if we were only betrothed, and not mar|ried; not even offering to take any of tho&s;e innocent freedoms which are not refu&s;ed in the mo&s;t puncti|lious loves.</P>
<P>And then he &s;olemnly vowed to me the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervance of the &s;ame re&s;pectful behaviour to me.</P>
<P>I told him, that I was not by any means &s;atisfied with the tale he had told, nor with the nece&s;&s;ity he wanted to lay me under, of appearing what I was not: That every &s;tep he took was a wry one, a needle&s;s wry one: And &s;ince he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to tell the people below any thing about me, I in&s;i&s;t|ed, that he &s;hould un&s;ay all he had &s;aid, and tell them the truth.</P>
<P>What he had told them, he &s;aid, was with &s;o many circum&s;tances, that he could &s;ooner die than contradict it. And &s;till he in&s;i&s;ted upon the propriety of appearing to be married, for the rea&s;ons he had given before.&mdash;And, deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he, why this high di&s;plea&s;ure with me upon &s;o well-intended an expedient? You know, that I cannot wi&s;h to &s;hun your brother, or his Singleton, but upon your ac|count. The fir&s;t &s;tep I would take, if le&s;t to my&s;elf, would be to find them out. I have always acted in this manner, when any-body has pre&s;umed to give out threatnings again&s;t me.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I &s;hould have con&s;ulted you fir&s;t, and had your leave. But &s;ince you di&s;like what I have &s;aid, let me implore you, deare&s;t Madam, to give the only proper &s;anction to it, by naming an early day. Would to heaven that were to be to-morrow!&mdash;For God's &s;ake, let it be to-morrow! But if not [Was it his bu&s;ine&s;s, my dear, before I &s;poke (yet he &s;eemed to be afraid of me), to &s;ay, If not?], let me be&s;eech you, Madam, if my behaviour &s;hall not be to your
<PB N="294" REF="295">
di&s;like, that you will not to-morrow at breakfa&s;t-time, di&s;credit what I have told them. The moment I give you cau&s;e to think, that I take any advantage of your conce&s;&s;ion, that moment revoke it, and expo&s;e me, as I &s;hall de&s;erve.&mdash;And once more, let me remind you, that I have no view either to &s;erve or &s;ave my|&s;elf by this expedient.&mdash;It is only to prevent a probable mi&s;chief, for your own minds &s;ake; and for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who de&s;erve not the lea&s;t con&s;ideration from me.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay? What could I do?&mdash;I verily think, that had he urged me again, in a proper man|ner, I &s;hould have con&s;ented (little &s;atisfy'd as I am with him) to give him a meeting to-morrow morn|ing at a more &s;olemn place than in the parlour below.</P>
<P>But this I re&s;olve, that he &s;hall not have my con|&s;ent to &s;tay a night under this roof. He has now given me a &s;tronger rea&s;on for this determination than I had before.</P>
<P>ALAS! my dear, how vain a thing to &s;ay, what we will or what we will not do, when we have put our&s;elves into the power of this &s;ex!&mdash;He went down to the people below, on my de&s;iring to be left to my|&s;elf; and &s;taid till their &s;upper was ju&s;t ready; and then, de&s;iring a moment's <HI>audience,</HI> as he called it, he be&s;ought my leave to &s;tay that one night, promi&s;ing to &s;et out either for Lord M.'s, or for Edgware, to his friend Belford's, in the morning after breakfa&s;t. But if I were again&s;t it, he &s;aid, he would not &s;tay &s;up|per; and would attend me about eight next day.&mdash;Yet he added, that my denial would have a very par|ticular appearance to the people below, from what he had told them; and the more, as he had actually agreed for all the vacant apartments (indeed only for a month), for the rea&s;on he had before hinted at: But I need not &s;tay here two days, if, upon conver&s;ing
<PB N="295" REF="296">
with the widow and her nieces in the morning, I &s;hould have any di&s;like to them.</P>
<P>I thought, notwith&s;tanding my re&s;olution above-mentioned, that it would &s;eem too punctilious to deny him; under the circum&s;tances he had mentioned:&mdash;Having, be&s;ides, no rea&s;on to think he would obey me; for he looked, as if he were determin'd to debate the matter with me. And, as now, I &s;ee no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friends, and had actually received his addre&s;&s;es with le&s;s re&s;erve than ever; I thought I would not quarrel with him, if I could help it, e&s;pecially as he a&s;ked to &s;tay but for one night, and could have done &s;o without my knowing it; and you being of opinion, that the proud wretch, di&s;tru&s;ting his own merits with me, or at lea&s;t my regard for him, will probably bring me to &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions in his fa|vour: For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, I thought proper to yield <HI>this</HI> point; yet I was &s;o vexed with him on the <HI>other,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to comply with that grace which a conce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made with, or not made at all.</P>
<P>This was what I &s;aid.&mdash;What you <HI>will</HI> do, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do, I think. You are very ready to promi&s;e; very ready to depart from your promi&s;e. You &s;ay, however, that you will &s;et out to-morrow for the country. You know how ill I have been. I am not well enough now to debate with you upon your in|croaching ways. I am utterly di&s;&s;atisfied with the tale you have told below. Nor will I promi&s;e to ap|pear to the people of the hou&s;e to-morrow, what I am not.</P>
<P>He withdrew, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, be|&s;eeching me only to favour him with &s;uch a meeting in the morning, as might not make the widow and her nieces think he had given me rea&s;on to be offended with him.</P>
<P>I retired to my own apartment, and Dorcas came to me &s;oon after to take my commands. I told her, that
<PB N="296" REF="297">
I required very little attendance, and always dre&s;&s;ed and undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed concerned, as if &s;he thought I had re|pul&s;ed her, and &s;aid, It &s;hould be her whole &s;tudy to oblige me.</P>
<P>I told her, that I was not difficult to plea&s;e. And &s;hould let her know from time to time what a&s;&s;i&s;tances I &s;hould expect from her. But for that night I had no occa&s;ion for her further attendance.</P>
<P>She is not only genteel, but is well-bred, and well-&s;poken.&mdash;She mu&s;t have had what is generally thought to be the polite part of education: But it is &s;trange, that fathers and mothers &s;hould make &s;o light, as they generally do, of that preferable part, in girls, which would improve their minds, and give a grace to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, I in&s;pected the doors, the windows, the wain&s;cot, the dark clo&s;et as well as the light one; and finding very good fa&s;tenings to the door, and to all the windows, I again had recour&s;e to my pen.</P>
<P>MRS. SINCLAIR is ju&s;t now gone from me. Dor|cas, &s;he told me, had acquainted her, that I had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed her for the night. She came to a&s;k me how I liked my apartment, and to wi&s;h me good re&s;t. She expre&s;&s;ed her concern, that they could not have my company at &s;upper. Mr. Lovelace, &s;he &s;aid, had in|formed them of my love of retirement. She a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould not be broken in upon. She highly extolled him, and gave me a &s;hare in the prai&s;e, as to per&s;on. But was &s;orry, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he was likely to lo&s;e us &s;o &s;oon as Mr. Lovelace talked of.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered her with &s;uitable civility; and &s;he with|drew with great tokens of re&s;pect. With greater, I think, than &s;hould be from di&s;tance of years, as &s;he was the wife of a gentleman; and as the appearance
<PB N="297" REF="298">
of every thing about her, as well hou&s;e as dre&s;s, carries the marks of &s;uch good circum&s;tances, as re|quire not aba&s;ement.</P>
<P>If, my dear, you <HI>will</HI> write again&s;t prohibition, be plea&s;ed to direct, <HI>To Mi&s;s Laetitia Beaumont; To be left till called for, at Mr. Wil&s;on's in Pall-Mall.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace propo&s;ed this direction to me, not knowing of your de&s;ire that our letters &s;hould pa&s;s by a third hand. As his motive for it was, that my bro|ther might not trace out where we are, I am glad, as well from this in&s;tance, as from others, that he &s;eems to think he has done mi&s;chief enough already.</P>
<P>Do you know how my poor Hannah does?</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace is &s;o full of his contrivances and ex|pedients, that I think it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;ire you to look carefully to the &s;eals of my letters, as I &s;hall to tho&s;e of yours. If I find him ba&s;e in this particular, I &s;hall think him capable of any evil; and will fly him as my wor&s;t enemy.</P>

<P>I Have yours, ju&s;t brought me. Mr. Hickman has help'd me to a lucky expedient, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the po&s;t, will enable me to corre&s;pond with you every day. An hone&s;t higgler (Simon Col|lins his name), by whom I &s;hall &s;end this, and the two inclo&s;ed (now I have your direction where), goes to town con&s;tantly on Mondays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays, and can bring back to me from Wil&s;on's what you &s;hall have cau&s;ed to be left for me.</P>
<P>I congratulate you on your arrival in town, &s;o much amended in &s;pirits. I mu&s;t be brief. I hope you'll
<PB N="298" REF="299">
have no cau&s;e to repent returning my Norris. It is forth-coming on demand.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry your Hannah can't be with you. She is very ill &s;till; but not in danger.</P>
<P>I long for your account of the women you are with. If they are not right people, you'll find them out in one breakfa&s;ting.</P>
<P>I know not what to write upon his reporting to them, that you are actually married. His rea&s;ons for it are plau&s;ible. But he delights in odd expedients and inventions.</P>
<P>Whether you like the people or not, don't, by your noble &s;incerity and plain-dealing, make your&s;elf enemies. You are in the world now, you know.</P>
<P>I am glad you had thoughts of taking him at his offer, if he had re-urged it. I wonder he did not. But if he don't &s;oon, and in &s;uch a way as you can accept of it, don't think of &s;taying with him.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, my dear, he will not leave you, either night or day, if he can help it, now he has got footing.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have abhorred him for his report of your marriage, had he not made it with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as leave it &s;till in your power to keep him at di&s;tance. If once he offer at the lea&s;t familiarity&mdash;But this is needle&s;s to &s;ay to you. He can have, I think, no other de&s;ign, but what he profe&s;&s;es; becau&s;e he mu&s;t needs think, that his report mu&s;t increa&s;e your vigi|lance.</P>
<P>You may depend upon my looking narrowly into the &s;ealings of your letters. If, as you &s;ay, he be ba&s;e in that point, he will be &s;o in every-thing. But to one of your merit, of your fortune, of your vir|tue, he cannot be ba&s;e. The man is no fool.

<P>I Am more and more di&s;plea&s;ed with Mr. Lovelace, on reflection, for his boldne&s;s in hoping to make me, tho' but <HI>pa&s;&s;ively,</HI> as I may &s;ay, te&s;tify to his great untruth. And I &s;hall like him &s;till le&s;s for it, if his view in it does not come out to be the hope of ac|celerating my re&s;olution in his favour, by the diffi|culty it will lay me under as to my behaviour to him. He has &s;ent me his compliments by Dorcas, with a reque&s;t that I will permit him to attend me in the dining-room; perhaps, that he may gue&s;s from thence, whether I will meet him in good-humour, or not: But I have an&s;wered, that as I &s;hall &s;ee him at breakfa&s;t-time, I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ten o'Clock.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I TRY'D to adju&s;t my countenance before I went down, to an ea&s;ier air than I had a heart, and was received with the highe&s;t tokens of re&s;pect by the wi|dow, and her two nieces: Agreeable young women enough in their per&s;ons; but they &s;eemed to put on an air of re&s;erve; while Mr. Lovelace was ea&s;y and free to all, as if he were of long acquaintance with them: gracefully enough, I cannot but &s;ay; an advan|tage which travelled gentlemen have over other people.</P>
<P>The widow, in the conver&s;ation we had after breakfa&s;t, gave us an account of the military merit of the colonel her hu&s;band; and, upon this occa&s;ion, put her handkerchief to her eye twice or thrice. I hope, for the &s;ake of her &s;incerity, &s;he wetted it, be|cau&s;e &s;he would be thought to have done &s;o; but I &s;aw not that &s;he did. She wi&s;h'd that I might never know the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band &s;o dear to me, as her dear colonel was to her: And again &s;he put her handkerchief to her eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301">It mu&s;t, no doubt, be a mo&s;t affecting thing to be &s;e|parated from a good hu&s;band, and to be left in diffi|cult circum&s;tances be&s;ides, and that not by <HI>his</HI> fault, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the ba&s;e and ingrateful; as &s;he repre&s;ented her ca&s;e to be at his death. This moved me a good deal in her favour.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, that I have an open and free heart, and, naturally, have as open and free a coun|tenance; at lea&s;t my complimenters have told me &s;o. At once, where I like, I mingle minds without re|&s;erve, encouraging reciprocal freedoms, and am for|ward to di&s;&s;ipate diffidences. But with the&s;e two young gentlewomen, I never can be intimate&mdash;I don't know why.</P>
<P>Only, that circum&s;tances, and what pa&s;&s;ed in con|ver&s;ation, encouraged not the notion, or I &s;hould have been apt to think, that the young gentlewomen and Mr. Lovelace were of longer acquaintance than ye&s;terday. For he, by &s;tealth, as it were, ca&s;t glances &s;ometimes at them, which they returned; and, on my ocular notice, their eyes fell, as I may &s;ay, under my eye, as if they could not &s;tand its examination.</P>
<P>The widow directed all her talk to me, as to Mrs. Lovelace; and I, with a very ill grace, bore it. And once &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, more forwardly than I thank'd her for, her wonder, that any vow, any con&s;ideration, however weighty, could have force enough with &s;o charming a couple, as &s;he called him and me, to make us keep &s;eparate beds.</P>
<P>Their eyes, upon this hint, had the advantage of mine. Yet was I not con&s;cious of guilt. How know I then, upon recollection, that my cen&s;ures upon theirs are not too ra&s;h? There are, no doubt, many truly mode&s;t per&s;ons (putting my&s;elf out of the que&s;tion), who, by blu&s;hes at an injurious charge, have been &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who cannot di|&s;tingui&s;h between the confu&s;ion which guilt will be at|tended
<PB N="301" REF="302">
with, and the noble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that over-&s;preads the face of a fine &s;pirit, to be thought but ca|pable of an imputed evil.</P>
<P>The great Roman, as we read, who took his &s;ur|name from one part in three (the fourth not then di&s;|covered) of the world he had triumphed over, being charged with a mean crime to his &s;oldiery, cho&s;e ra|ther to &s;uffer exile (the puni&s;hment due to it, had he been found guilty), than to have it &s;aid, that Scipio was que&s;tioned in public, on &s;o &s;candalous a charge. And think you, my dear, that Scipio did not blu&s;h with indignation, when the charge was fir&s;t commu|nicated to him?</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, when the widow expre&s;&s;ed her for|ward wonder, looked &s;ly and leering, as if to ob&s;erve how I took it; and &s;aid, they might ob&s;erve that his regard for my will and plea&s;ure, calling me his dear creature, had greater force upon him, than the oath by which he had bound him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Rebuking both him and the widow, I &s;aid, It was &s;trange to me to hear an oath or vow &s;o lightly treat|ed, as to have it thought but of <HI>&s;econd</HI> con&s;ideration, whatever, were the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation was ju&s;t, Mi&s;s Martin &s;aid; for that nothing could excu&s;e the breaking of a &s;olemn vow, be the occa&s;ion of making it what it would.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked after the neare&s;t church; for I have been too long a &s;tranger to the &s;acred wor&s;hip. They named St. James's, St. Anne's, and another in Bloom&s;|bury; and the two nieces &s;aid, they oftene&s;t went to St. James's church, becau&s;e of the good company, as well as for the excellent preaching.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace &s;aid, the Royal Chapel was the place he oftene&s;t went to, when in town: Poor man! little did I expect to hear he went to any place of devotion. I a&s;ked, If the pre&s;ence of the vi&s;ible king of, com|paratively, but a &s;mall territory, did not take off, too generally, the requi&s;ite attention to the &s;ervice of
<PB N="302" REF="303">
the invi&s;ible King and Maker of a thou&s;and worlds?</P>
<P>He believed this might be &s;o with &s;uch as came for curio&s;ity, when the Royal Family were pre&s;ent. But, otherwi&s;e, he had &s;een as many contrite faces at the Royal Chapel, as any-where el&s;e: And why not? Since the people about Courts have as deep &s;cores to wipe off, as any people what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this with &s;o much levity, that I could not help &s;aying, That nobody que&s;tioned but he knew how to choo&s;e his company.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, my dear, bowing, were his words; and turning to them, You will ob&s;erve, upon num|berle&s;s occa&s;ions, ladies, as we are further acquainted, that my beloved never &s;pares me upon the&s;e topics. But I admire her as much in her reproofs, as I am fond of her approbation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Horton &s;aid, There was a time for every-thing. She could not but &s;ay, that &s;he thought innocent mirth was mighty becoming in young people.</P>
<P>Very true, joined in Mi&s;s Martin. And Shake|&s;peare &s;ays well, <HI>That youth is the &s;pring of life, The bloom of gawdy years</HI>; with a theatrical air &s;he &s;poke it: And for her part, &s;he could not but admire in my &s;pou&s;e, that charming vivacity which &s;o well &s;uited his time of life.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace bowed. The man is fond of prai&s;e. More fond of it, I doubt, than of de&s;erving it. Yet this &s;ort of prai&s;e he does de&s;erve. He has, you know, an ea&s;y free manner, and no bad voice: And this prai&s;e &s;o expanded his gay heart, that he &s;ung the fol|lowing lines, from Congreve, as he told us:
<Q><L>Youth does a thou&s;and plea&s;ures bring,</L>
<L>Which from decrepit age will fly;</L>
<L>Sweets that wanton in the bo&s;om of the &s;pring,</L>
<L>In winter's cold embraces die.</L></Q></P>
<P>And this for a compliment, as he &s;aid, to the two nieces. Nor was it thrown away upon them. They
<PB N="303" REF="304">
encored it; and his compliance fix'd them in my memory.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome talk about meals; and the widow very civilly offer'd to conform to any rules I would &s;et her. I told her, how ea&s;ily I was plea&s;ed, and how much I cho&s;e to dine by my&s;elf, and that from a plate &s;ent me from any &s;ingle di&s;h. But I will not trouble you with &s;uch particulars.</P>
<P>They thought me very &s;ingular; and with rea&s;on: But as I liked them not &s;o very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to them, I was the le&s;s concerned for what they thought. And &s;till the le&s;s, as Mr. Lovelace had put me very much out of hu|mour with him.</P>
<P>They, however, caution'd me again&s;t melancholy. I &s;aid, I &s;hould be a very unhappy creature, if I could not bear my own company.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace &s;aid, That he mu&s;t let the ladies into my &s;tory; and then they would know how to allow for my ways. But, <HI>my dear, as you love me,</HI> &s;aid the confident wretch, give as little way to melancholy as po&s;&s;ible. Nothing but the &s;weetne&s;s of your temper, and your high notions of a duty that can never be de|&s;erved where you place it, can make you &s;o unea&s;y as you are.&mdash;Be not angry, <HI>my dear love,</HI> for &s;aying &s;o (&s;eeing me frown, I &s;uppo&s;e): And &s;natched my hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>I left him with them; and retired to my clo&s;et and my pen.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I have wrote thus far, I am interrupted by a me&s;&s;age from him, that he is &s;etting out on a journey, and de&s;ires to take my commands.&mdash;So here I will leave off, to give him a meeting in the dining room.
<LETTER>
<P>I WAS not di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee him in his riding dre&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed de&s;irous to know how I liked the gentle|women below. I told him, that altho' I did not think them very exceptionable, yet as I wanted not,
<PB N="304" REF="305">
in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, new acquaintance, I &s;hould not be fond of cultivating theirs; and he mu&s;t &s;econd me, particularly in my de&s;ire of breakfa&s;ting and &s;upping (when I <HI>did</HI> &s;up) by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>If I would have it &s;o, to be &s;ure it &s;hould be &s;o. The people of the hou&s;e were not of con&s;equence enough to be apologiz'd to, in any point where my plea&s;ure was concerned. And if I &s;hould di&s;like them &s;till more on further knowlege of them, he hoped I would think of &s;ome other lodgings.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed a good deal of regret at leaving me, declaring, that it was ab&s;olutely in obedience to my commands: But that he could not have con&s;ented to go, while my brother's &s;chemes were on foot, if I had not done him the credit of my countenance in the report he had made that we were marry'd; which, he &s;aid, had bound all the family to his intere&s;t, &s;o that he could leave me with the greater &s;ecurity and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>He hoped, he &s;aid, that on his return, I would name his happy day; and the rather as I might be convinced, by my brother's projects, that no recon|ciliation was to be expected.</P>
<P>I told him, that perhaps I might write one letter to my uncle Harlowe. He once loved me. I &s;hould be ea&s;ier when I had made one direct application. I might po&s;&s;ibly propo&s;e &s;uch terms, in relation to my grandfather's e&s;tate, as might procure me their at|tention; and I hoped he would be long enough ab&s;ent to give me time to write to him, and receive an an|&s;wer from him.</P>
<P>That, he mu&s;t beg my pardon, he could not pro|mi&s;e. He would inform him&s;elf of Singleton's and my brother's motions; and if on his return, he found no rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ions, he would go directly to Berks, and endeavour to bring up with him his cou&s;in Charlotte, who, he hoped, would induce me to give him an earlier day, than at pre&s;ent I &s;eemed to think of.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">I told him, that I would take that young lady's company for a great favour.</P>
<P>I was the more plea&s;ed with this motion, as it came from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed me to accept of a bank note: But I declined it. And then he offer'd me his &s;ervant William for my attendant in his ab&s;ence; who, he &s;aid, might be di&s;patched to him, if any thing extra|ordinary fell out. I con&s;ented to that.</P>
<P>He took his leave of me, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, only ki&s;&s;ing my hand. He left the note un|ob&s;erv'd by me upon the table. You may be &s;ure I &s;hall give it him back at his return.</P>
<P>I am now in a much better humour with him than I was. Where doubts of any per&s;on are removed, a mind, not ungenerous, is willing, by way of amends for having conceived tho&s;e doubts, to con&s;true every|thing that happens <HI>capable</HI> of a good con&s;truction, in that per&s;on's favour. Particularly, I cannot but be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that altho' he &s;peaks of the ladies of his family with the freedom of relation&s;hip, yet it is always with tenderne&s;s. And from a man's kind|ne&s;s to his relations of the &s;ex, a woman has &s;ome rea&s;ons to expect his good behaviour to her&s;elf, when married, if &s;he be willing to de&s;erve it from him. And thus, my dear, am I brought to &s;uch a pa&s;s, as to &s;it my&s;elf down &s;atisfy'd with this man, where I find room to infer, that he is not naturally a &s;avage.</P>
<P>May you, my dear friend, be always happy in your reflections, prays</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever-affectionate CL. HARLOWE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace in his next letter triumphs on his having carried his two great points of making the lady yield to pa&s;s for his wife to the people of the hou&s;e, and to his taking up his lodging in it, tho' but for one night. He is now &s;ure, he &s;ays, that he &s;hall
<PB N="306" REF="307">
&s;oon prevail, if not by per&s;ua&s;ion, by &s;urprize. Yet he pretends to have &s;ome little remor&s;e, and cen&s;ures him&s;elf as acting the part of the grand tempter. But having &s;ucceeded thus far, he cannot, he &s;ays, forbear trying, according to the re&s;olution he had before made, whether he cannot go farther.</P>

<P>MR. Lovelace is returned already. My brother's projects were his pretence. I could not but look upon this &s;hort ab&s;ence as an eva&s;ion of his pro|mi&s;e; e&s;pecially as he had taken &s;uch precautions with the people below; and as he knew that I propo&s;ed to keep clo&s;e within doors. I cannot bear to be dealt meanly with, and angrily in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould di+rectly &s;et out for Berk&s;hire, in order to engage his cou&s;in, as he had promi&s;ed.</P>

I have been hovering about town, ever &s;ince I left you. Edgware was the furthe&s;t place I went to; and there I was not able to &s;tay two hours, for fear, at this cri&s;is any thing &s;hould happen. Who can account for the workings of an apprehen&s;ive mind, when all that is dear and valuable to it is at &s;take?&mdash;You may &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of writing to any of your friends till the happy ceremony has pa&s;&s;ed, that &s;hall intitle me to give weight to your application. When they know we are marry'd, your brother's plots will be at an end; and your father and mother, and uncles, mu&s;t be reconciled to you.&mdash;Why then &s;hould you he&s;itate a moment to confirm my happine&s;s?&mdash;Why, once more, would you bani&s;h me from you? Why will you not give the man, who has brought you into difficulties, and who &s;o honourably wi&s;hes to extri|cate you from them, the happine&s;s of doing &s;o?</P>

And on &s;ome early day, either before or after we fix (it mu&s;t be at your own choice) be plea&s;ed to make me the happie&s;t of men. And then will every thing be in a de&s;irable train. You &s;hall receive in your own hou&s;e (if it can be &s;o &s;oon furni&s;h'd as I wi&s;h) the congratulations of all my relations: Char|lotte &s;hall vi&s;it you in the interim: And if it take up time, you &s;hall choo&s;e whom you'll honour with your company, fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third, in the &s;ummer months; and on your return, you &s;hall find all that was wanting in your new habitation &s;upply'd; and plea&s;ures in a con&s;tant round &s;hall attend us.

<P>MR. Lovelace has &s;een two or three hou&s;es; but none to his mind. But he has heard of one which looks promi&s;ing, he &s;ays, and which he is to inquire about in the morning.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HE has made his inquiries, and actually &s;een the hou&s;e he was told of la&s;t night. The owner of it is a young widow lady, who is incon&s;olable for the death of her hu&s;band, Fretchville her name. It is furni&s;hed quite in ta&s;te, every thing being new with|in the&s;e &s;ix months. He believes, if I like not the furniture, the u&s;e of it may be agreed for, with the hou&s;e, for a time certain: But if I like it, he will endeavour to take the one, and purcha&s;e the other, directly.</P>
<P>The lady &s;ees no-body; nor are the be&s;t apartments above-&s;tairs to be view'd till &s;he is either ab&s;ent, or gone into the country, where &s;he propo&s;es to live re|tired; and which &s;he talks of doing in a fortnight or three weeks, at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>What Mr. Lovelace &s;aw of the hou&s;e (which were the &s;alon and two parlours) was perfectly elegant and he was a&s;&s;ured, all is of a piece. The offices are al&s;o very convenient; coach-hou&s;e and &s;tables a hand.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="312">He &s;hall be very impatient, he &s;ays, till I &s;ee the whole; nor will he, if he finds he can have it, look farther till I have &s;een it, except any thing el&s;e offer to my liking. The price he values not.</P>
<P>He has ju&s;t now received a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance, by a particular hand; the contents prin|cipally relating to an affair &s;he has in Chancery. But in the po&s;t&s;cript &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay very re&s;pectful things of me. They are all impatient, &s;he &s;ays, for the happy day being over; which, they flatter them|&s;elves, will <HI>en&s;ure his reformation.</HI></P>
<P>He hoped, he told me, that I would &s;oon enable him to an&s;wer <HI>their</HI> wi&s;hes, and <HI>his own.</HI> But, altho' the opportunity was &s;o inviting, he urged not for the day. Which is the more extraordinary, as he was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing for marriage before we came to town.</P>
<P>He was very earne&s;t with me to give him, and four of his friends, my company on Monday evening, at a little collation. Mi&s;s Martin and Mi&s;s Horton can|not, he &s;ays, be there, being engaged in a party of their own, with two daughters of Colonel Solcombe, and two nieces of Sir Anthony Holmes, upon an an|nual occa&s;ion. But Mrs. Sinclair will be pre&s;ent, and &s;he gave him hope al&s;o of the company of a young maiden lady of very great fortune and merit (Mi&s;s Partington), to whom Colonel Sinclair, it &s;eems, in his life-time, was guardian, and who therefore calls Mrs. Sinclair mamma.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. He had laid me, I &s;aid, under a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of appearing as a married per&s;on; and I would &s;ee as few people as po&s;&s;ible who were to think me &s;o.</P>
<P>He would not urge it, he &s;aid, if I were <HI>much</HI> aver&s;e: But they were his &s;elect friends, men of birth and fortune; who long'd to &s;ee me. It was true, that they, as well as his friend Doleman, believed we were married: But they thought him under the re|&s;trictions that he had mentioned to the people below.
<PB N="312" REF="313">
I might be a&s;&s;ured, he told me, that his politene&s;s be|fore them &s;hould be carried into the highe&s;t degree of reverence.</P>
<P>When he is &s;et upon any thing, there is no know|ing, as I have &s;aid heretofore, what one <HI>can</HI> do. But I will not, if I can help it, be made a &s;hew of; e&s;pe|cially to men of who&s;e characters and principles I have no good opinion. I am, my deare&s;t friend,</P>

Her voice, which when &s;he plea&s;es, is the voice of thunder, is &s;unk into an humble whine. Her &s;tiff hams, that have not been bent to a civility for ten years pa&s;t, are now limber'd into courte&s;ies three-deep at every word.

<P>The vi&s;itors of the two nieces will croud the hou&s;e. Beds will be &s;carce.

The &s;hye&s;t birds may be caught napping. Should &s;he attempt to fly me upon it, cannot I detain her?

All delicacy is my charmer. I long to &s;ee how &s;uch a delicacy, on either occa&s;ion, will behave. And in my &s;ituation it be|hoves me to provide again&s;t every accident.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take care, knowing what an eel I have to do with, that the little wriggling rogue does not &s;lip thro' my fingers. How &s;illy &s;hould I look, &s;taring after her, when &s;he had &s;hot from me into the muddy river, her family, from which, with &s;o much diffi|culty, I have taken her!</P>

<P>HAVE been at church, Jack.&mdash;Behaved admi|rably well too!&mdash;My charmer is plea&s;ed with me now:&mdash;For I was exceedingly attentive to the di&s;cour&s;e, and very ready in the auditor's part of the &s;ervice.&mdash;Eyes did not much wander.

<P>Dear creature! how fervent, how amiable, in her devotions!&mdash;I have got her to own, that &s;he pray'd for me!&mdash;I hope a prayer from &s;o excellent a mind will not be made in vain.</P>
<P>There is, after all, &s;omething beautifully &s;olemn in devotion!&mdash;The Sabbath is a charming in&s;titution to <HI>keep</HI> the heart right, when it <HI>is</HI> right.

Yet it adds a &s;ting or two to my former &s;tings, when I think of my projects with regard to this charming creature. In my con&s;cience, I believe, if I were to go con|&s;tantly to church, I could not pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>I had a &s;cheme come into my head while there: But I will renounce it, becau&s;e it obtruded it&s;elf upon me in &s;o good a place. Excellent creature! How many

<P>But let me tell thee what pa&s;&s;ed between us in my fir&s;t vi&s;it of this morning; and then I will acquaint thee more largely with my good behaviour at church.</P>
<P>I could not be admitted till after eight. I found her ready prepared to go out. I pretended to be igno|rant of her intention, having charged Dorcas not to own, that &s;he had told me of it.</P>
<P>Going abroad, Madam?&mdash;with an air of indifference.</P>

<P>No: She de&s;ign'd to take a chair, and go to the next church.</P>
<P>This &s;tartled me: A chair to carry her to the next church from Mrs. Sinclair's, her right name not Sin+clair, and to bring her back thither, in the face of people who might not think well of the hou&s;e! There was no permitting That:&mdash;Yet I was to appear in|different.&mdash;But &s;aid, I &s;hould take it for a favour, if &s;he would permit me to attend her in a coach, as there was time for it, to St. Paul's.</P>
<P>She made objections to the gaiety of my dre&s;s; and told me, that, if &s;he went to St. Paul's, &s;he could go in a coach without <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I objected Singleton and her brother, and offered to dre&s;s in the plaine&s;t &s;uit I had.</P>
<P>I beg the favour of attending you, dear Madam, &s;aid I. I have not been at church a great while: We &s;hall &s;it in different &s;talls: And the next time I go, I hope it will be to give my&s;elf a title to the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing I can receive.</P>
<P>She made &s;ome further objections: But at la&s;t per|mitted me the honour of attending her.</P>
<P>I got my&s;elf placed in her eye, that the time might not &s;eem tedious to me; for we were there early. And I gain'd her good opinion, as I mention'd above, by my behaviour.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">The &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e was particular enough: It was about a prophet's &s;tory or parable of an ewe|lamb taken by a rich man from a poor one, who dearly loved it, and who&s;e only comfort it was: De&s;igned to &s;trike remor&s;e into David, on his adultery with Uriah's wife Bath&s;heba, and his murder of the hu&s;|band. [The&s;e women. Jack, have been the occa&s;ion of all manner of mi&s;chief from the beginning!] Now, when David, full of indignation, &s;wore [King David would &s;wear, Jack: But how &s;hould&s;t thou know who King David was? The &s;tory is in the Bible], that the rich man &s;hould &s;urely die; Nathan, which was the prophet's name, and a good ingenious fellow, cry'd out (which were the words of the text), <HI>Thou art the man!</HI>&mdash;By my &s;oul I thought the par&s;on look'd directly at me: And at that moment I ca&s;t my eye full at my ewe-lamb. But I mu&s;t tell thee too, that I thought a good deal of my Ro&s;ebud.&mdash;A better man than King David, in that point, however, thought I!</P>
<P>When we came home, we talk'd upon the &s;ubject; and I &s;hew'd my charmer my attention to the di&s;|cour&s;e, by letting her know where the doctor made the mo&s;t of his &s;ubject, and where it might have been touch'd to greater advantage (For it is really a very af|fecting &s;tory, and has as pretty a contrivance in it as ever I read). And this I did in &s;uch a grave way, that &s;he &s;eemed more and more pleas'd with me; and I have no doubt, that I &s;hall get her to favour me to|morrow night with her company at my collation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday night, May 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t e&s;caped from the very di&s;agreeable company I was obliged, &s;o much again&s;t my will, to be in. As a very particular relation of this even|ing's conver&s;ation would be painful to me, you mu&s;t content your&s;elf with what you &s;hall be able to collect from the outlines, as I may call them, of the cha|racters of the per&s;ons, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the little hi&s;tories Mr. Lovelace gave me of each ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>The names of the gentlemen are Belton, Mow|bray, Tourville, and Belford. The&s;e four, with Mrs. Sinclair, Mi&s;s Partington, the great heire&s;s men|tioned in my la&s;t, Mr. Lovelace, and my&s;elf, made up the company.</P>
<P>I gave you before the favourable &s;ide of Mi&s;s Par|tington's character, &s;uch as it was given me by Mrs. Sinclair, and her nieces. I will now add a few words from my own ob&s;ervations upon her behaviour in <HI>this</HI> company.</P>
<P>In <HI>better</HI> company, perhaps, &s;he would have ap|peared to le&s;s di&s;advantage: But, notwith&s;tanding her innocent looks, which Mr. Lovelace al&s;o highly prai&s;ed, he is the la&s;t per&s;on who&s;e judgment I would take upon real mode&s;ty. For I ob&s;erved, that, upon &s;ome talk from the gentlemen, not free enough to be openly cen&s;ured, yet too indecent in its implication to come from well-bred per&s;ons, in the company of vir|tuous people, this young lady was very ready to ap|prehend; and yet, by &s;miles and &s;imperings, to en|courage, rather than di&s;courage, the culpable freedoms of per&s;ons, who, in what they went out of their way to &s;ay, mu&s;t either be guilty of ab&s;urdity, meaning <HI>no|thing</HI>; or, meaning <HI>&s;omething,</HI> of rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>But indeed I have &s;een ladies, of whom I have had a better opinion, than I can &s;ay I have of Mrs. Sin|clair,
<PB N="322" REF="323">
who have allowed <HI>gentlemen,</HI> and <HI>them&s;elves</HI> too, in greater liberties of this &s;ort, than I have thought con&s;i&s;tent with that purity of manners which ought to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of our &s;ex: For what are <HI>words,</HI> but the <HI>body</HI> and <HI>dre&s;s</HI> of <HI>thought?</HI> And is not the mind indicated &s;trongly by its outward dre&s;s?</P>
<P>But to the gentlemen, as they mu&s;t be called in right of their ance&s;tors, it &s;eems; for no other do they appear to have.</P>
<P>Mr. BELTON has had univer&s;ity-education, and was de&s;igned for the gown; but that not &s;uiting with the gaiety of his temper, and an uncle dying, who be|queathed to him a good e&s;tate, he quitted the college, came up to town, and commenced fine gentleman. He is &s;aid to be a man of &s;en&s;e. He dre&s;&s;es gaily, but not quite foppi&s;hly; drinks hard; keeps all hours, and glories in doing &s;o; games, and has been hurt by that pernicious diver&s;ion: He is about thirty years of age: His face is of a fiery red, &s;omewhat bloated and pimply; and his irregularities threaten a brief duration to the &s;en&s;ual dream he is in; for he has a &s;hort con|&s;umptive cough, which &s;eems to indicate bad lungs; yet makes him&s;elf and his friends merry, by his &s;tupid and incon&s;iderate je&s;ts upon very threatening &s;ym|ptoms, which ought to make him more &s;erious.</P>
<P>Mr. MOWBRAY has been a great traveller; &s;peaks as many languages as Mr. Lovelace him&s;elf, but not &s;o fluently: Is of a good family: Seems to be about thirty-three or thirty-four: Tall and comely in his per&s;on: Bold and daring in his look: Is a large-boned &s;trong man: Has a great &s;car in his forehead, with a dent, as if his &s;kull had been beaten in there; and a &s;eamed &s;car in his right cheek. He dre&s;&s;es likewi&s;e very gaily: Has his &s;ervants always about him, whom he is continually calling upon, and &s;ending on the mo&s;t trifling me&s;&s;ages; half a dozen in&s;tances of which we had in the little time I was among them; while
<PB N="323" REF="324">
they &s;eem to watch the turn of his fierce eye, to be ready to run, before they have half his me&s;&s;age, and &s;erve him with fear and trembling. Yet to his equals the man &s;eems tolerable: Talks not ami&s;s upon pub|lic entertainments and diver&s;ions, e&s;pecially upon tho&s;e abroad: Yet has a romancing air; and averrs things &s;trongly, which &s;eem quite improbable. In|deed, he <HI>doubts</HI> nothing, but what he ought to <HI>be|lieve:</HI> For he je&s;ts upon &s;acred things; and profe&s;&s;es to hate the clergy of all religions: Has high notions of <HI>honour,</HI> a word hardly ever out of his mouth; but &s;eems to have no great regard to <HI>morals.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. TOURVILLE occa&s;ionally told his age; ju&s;t turn'd of thirty-one. He al&s;o is of an antient family; but, in his per&s;on and manners, more of what I call the coxcomb, than any of his companions: He dre&s;&s;es richly; would be thought elegant in the choice and fa&s;hion of what he wears; yet, after all, appears ra|ther tawdry than fine. One &s;ees, by the care he takes of his out&s;ide, and the notice he be&s;peaks from <HI>every one,</HI> by his <HI>own</HI> notice of him&s;elf, that the in&s;ide takes up the lea&s;t of his attention. He dances finely, Mr. Lovelace &s;ays: Is a ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic; and &s;inging is one of his principal excellencies. They prevailed upon him to &s;ing; and he obliged them both in Italian and French; and, to do him ju&s;tice, his &s;ongs in both were decent. They were all highly delighted with his performance; but his greate&s;t admirers were Mrs. Sinclair, Mi&s;s Partington, and <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> To me he appeared to have a great deal of affectation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tourville's conver&s;ation and addre&s;s are in&s;uf|ferably full of tho&s;e really gro&s;s affronts upon the un|der&s;tandings of our &s;ex, which the moderns call <HI>com|pliments,</HI> and are intended to pa&s;s for &s;o many in&s;tances of good breeding, tho' the mo&s;t hyperbolical, unna|tural &s;tuff that can be conceived, and which can only &s;erve to &s;hew the in&s;incerity of the <HI>complimenter</HI>; and the ridiculous light in which the <HI>complimented</HI> appears
<PB N="324" REF="325">
in his eyes, if he &s;uppo&s;es a woman capable of reli&s;h|ing the romantic ab&s;urdities of his &s;peeches.</P>
<P>He affects to introduce into his common talk Italian and French words; and often an&s;wers an Engli&s;h que&s;tion in French, which language he greatly pre|fers to the barbarou&s;ly hi&s;&s;ing Engli&s;h. But then he never fails to tran&s;late, into this his odious native tongue, the words, and the &s;entences, he &s;peaks in the other two&mdash;Le&s;t, perhaps, it &s;hould be que&s;tion|ed, whether he under&s;tands what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>He loves to tell &s;tories: Always calls them <HI>merry, facetious, good,</HI> or <HI>excellent,</HI> before he begins, in or|der to be&s;peak the attention of the hearers; but never gives him&s;elf concern, in the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> or <HI>conclu&s;ion</HI> of them, to make good what he promi&s;es in his <HI>preface.</HI> Indeed he &s;eldom brings any of them to a conclu&s;ion; for, if his company have patience to hear him out, he breaks in upon him&s;elf by &s;o many parenthetical intru|&s;ions, as one may call them, and has &s;o many inci|dents &s;pringing in upon him, that he frequently drops his own thread, and &s;ometimes &s;its down &s;atisfied half|way; or, if at other times he would re&s;ume it, he ap|plies to his company to help him in again, with a <HI>Devil fetch him</HI> if he remembers what he was driving at. But enough, and too much, of Mr. Tourville.</P>
<P>Mr. BELFORD is the fourth gentleman, and one of whom Mr. Lovelace &s;eems more fond than any of the re&s;t&mdash;Being a man of try'd bravery, it &s;eems; for this pair of friends came acquainted upon occa&s;ion of a quarrel (po&s;&s;ibly about a lady), which a rencounter at Ken&s;ington gravelpits ended, by the mediation of three gentlemen &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford is about &s;even or eight and-twenty, it &s;eems; the younge&s;t of the five, except Mr. Love|lace: And the&s;e are, perhaps, the wickede&s;t; for they &s;eem capable of leading the other three as they plea&s;e. Mr. Belford, as the others, dre&s;&s;es gaily: But has not tho&s;e advantages of per&s;on, nor from his
<PB N="325" REF="326">
dre&s;s, which Mr. Lovelace is too proud of. He has, however, the appearance of a gentleman. He is well read in cla&s;&s;ical authors, and in the be&s;t Engli&s;h poets and writers: And, by his means, the conver|&s;ation took now-and-then a more agreeable turn: And I, who endeavoured to put the be&s;t face I could upon my &s;ituation, as I pa&s;&s;ed for Mrs. Lovelace with them, made &s;hift to join in it, at &s;uch times; and received abundance of compliments from all the company, on the ob&s;ervations I made.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford &s;eems good-natured and obliging; and, altho' very complai&s;ant, not &s;o ful&s;omely &s;o, as Mr. Tourville; and has a polite and ea&s;y manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments on all occa&s;ions. He &s;eems to delight in a logical way of argumentation, as al&s;o does Mr. Belton; the&s;e two attacking each other in this way; and both looking at us women, as if to ob&s;erve whether we did not admire their learning, or their wit, when they had &s;aid a &s;mart thing. But Mr. Belford had vi&s;ibly the advantage of the other, having quicker parts, and, by taking the wor&s;t &s;ide of the argument, &s;eemed to <HI>think</HI> he had: All together, he put me in mind of that character in Milton:
<Q><L>&mdash;His tongue</L>
<L>Dropt manna, and could make the wor&s;e appear</L>
<L>The better rea&s;on, to perplex and da&s;h</L>
<L>Mature&s;t coun&s;els; for his thoughts were low;</L>
<L>To vice indu&s;trious: But to nobler deeds</L>
<L>Tim'rous and &s;lothful:&mdash;Yet he pleas'd the ear.</L></Q></P>
<P>How little &s;oever matters in general may be to our liking, we are apt to endeavour, when hope is &s;trong enough to permit it, to make the be&s;t we can of the lot we have drawn; and I could not but ob&s;erve often, how much Mr. Lovelace excelled all his four friends in every thing they &s;eemed de&s;irous to excel in. But, as to wit and vivacity, he had no equal pre&s;ent. All the others gave up to him, when his lips began to open.
<PB N="326" REF="327">
The haughty Mowbray would call upon the prating Tourville for &s;ilence, and with his elbow would punch the &s;upercilious Belton into attention, when Lovelace was going to &s;peak. And when he had &s;poken, the words, Charming fellow! with a free word of admira|tion or envy, fell from every mouth. He has indeed &s;o many advantages in his per&s;on and manner, that what would be inexcu&s;able in another, if one took not great care to watch over one's &s;elf, and to di&s;tingui&s;h what is the e&s;&s;ence of right and wrong, would look becoming in him.</P>
<P>'See him among twenty men,' &s;aid Mr. Belford; who, to my no &s;mall vexation and confu&s;ion, with the forwardne&s;s of a favoured and intru&s;ted friend, &s;ingled me out, on Mr. Lovelace's being &s;ent for down, to make me congratulatory compliments on my &s;uppo&s;ed nuptials; which he did with a caution, not to in&s;i&s;t too long on the rigorous vow I had im|po&s;ed upon a man &s;o univer&s;ally admired&mdash;</P>
<P>'See him among twenty men,' &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'all of di|&s;tinction, and nobody is regarded but Mr. Love|lace.'</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, that there is in his whole deportment a natural dignity, which renders all in&s;olent or imperative demeanour as unnece&s;&s;ary as inexcu&s;able. Then that deceiving &s;weetne&s;s which appears in his &s;miles, in his accent, in his whole a&s;pect and addre&s;s, when he thinks it worth his while to oblige, or endeavour to attract, how does this &s;hew, that he was <HI>born</HI> innocent, as I may &s;ay; that he was not <HI>naturally</HI> the cruel, the boi&s;terous, the im|petuous creature, which the wicked company he may have fallen into have made him! For he has, be&s;ides, an open, and, I think, an hone&s;t countenance. Don't you think &s;o too?&mdash;On all the&s;e &s;pecious appearances, have I founded my hopes of &s;eeing him a reformed man.</P>
<P>But 'tis amazing to me, I own, that with &s;o much
<PB N="327" REF="328">
of the gentleman, &s;uch a general knowlege of books and men, &s;uch a &s;kill in the learned as well as mo|dern languages, he can take &s;o much delight as he does in the company of &s;uch per&s;ons as I have de|&s;cribed, and in &s;ubjects of frothy impertinence, un|worthy of his talents, and natural and acquired advan|tages. I can think of but one rea&s;on for it, and that mu&s;t argue a very low mind; his VANITY; which makes him de&s;irous of being con&s;idered as the head of the people he con&s;orts with. A man to love prai&s;e; yet to be content to draw it from &s;uch contaminated &s;prings!</P>
<P>One compliment pa&s;&s;ed from Mr. Belford to Mr. Lovelace, which ha&s;tened my quitting the &s;hocking company&mdash;'You are a happy man, Mr. Lovelace,' &s;aid he, upon &s;ome fine &s;peeches made him by Mrs. Sinclair, and a&s;&s;ented to by Mi&s;s Partington:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You have &s;o much courage, and &s;o much wit, that nei|ther man nor woman can &s;tand before you.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Belford looked at me, when he &s;poke: Yes, my dear, he &s;milingly looked at me: And he looked upon his complimented friend: And all their <HI>a&s;&s;enting,</HI> and therefore <HI>affronting</HI> eyes, both mens and womens, were turned upon your Clari&s;&s;a: At lea&s;t, my &s;elf-reproaching heart made me think &s;o; for that would hardly permit my eye to look up.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear, were but a woman, who is thought to be in love with a man (and this mu&s;t be believed to be my ca&s;e; or to what can my <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> voluntary going off with Mr. Lovelace be imputed to?) to re|flect one moment on the exaltation &s;he gives <HI>him,</HI> and the di&s;grace &s;he brings upon <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> the low pity, the &s;ilent contempt, the in&s;olent &s;neers and whi&s;pers, to which &s;he makes her&s;elf obnoxious from a cen&s;uring world of both &s;exes, how would &s;he de&s;pi&s;e her&s;elf! And how much more eligible would &s;he think death it&s;elf to &s;uch a di&s;covered deba&s;ement!</P>
<P>What I have thus in general touched upon, will
<PB N="328" REF="329">
account to you, why I could not more particularly relate what pa&s;&s;ed in the evening's conver&s;ation: Which, as may be gathered from what I have written, abounded with <HI>approbatory</HI> accu&s;ations, and <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> witry retorts.</P>

<P>I Am very much vexed and di&s;turbed at an odd inci|dent.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair has ju&s;t now left me, I believe in di&s;plea&s;ure, on my declining to comply with a reque&s;t &s;he made me: Which was, To admit Mi&s;s Partington to a &s;hare in my bed; her hou&s;e being crouded by her nieces gue&s;ts, and their attendants, as well as by tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Partington.</P>
<P>There might be nothing in it; and my denial car|ried a &s;tiff and ill-natured appearance. But in&s;tantly, all at once, upon her making the reque&s;t, it came into my thought, that I was, in a manner, a &s;tranger to every-body in the hou&s;e: Not &s;o much as a &s;ervant I could call my own, or of whom I had any great opi|nion: That there were four gentlemen of free man|ners in the hou&s;e, avowed &s;upporters of Mr. Love|lace in matters of offence; him&s;elf a man of enter|prize; all, as far as I knew (and had rea&s;on to think by their noi&s;y mirth after I had left them), drinking deeply: That Mi&s;s Partington her&s;elf is not &s;o ba&s;h|ful a lady, as &s;he was repre&s;ented to me to be: That officious pains were taken to give me a good opinion of her: And that Mrs. Sinclair made a greater pa|rade in prefacing the reque&s;t, than &s;uch a reque&s;t needed. To deny, thought I, can carry only an ap|pearance of &s;ingularity, to people who <HI>already</HI> think me &s;ingular. To con&s;ent, may po&s;&s;ibly, if not pro|bably, be attended with inconveniences. The con&s;e|quences of the alternative &s;o very di&s;proportionate, I
<PB N="329" REF="330">
thought it more prudent to incur the cen&s;ure, than ri&s;k the inconvenience.</P>
<P>I told her, that I was writing a long letter: That I &s;hould choo&s;e to write till I were &s;leepy: And that Mi&s;s would be a re&s;traint upon me, and I upon her.</P>
<P>She was loth, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;o delicate a young crea|ture, and &s;o great a fortune, as Mi&s;s Partington was, &s;hould be put to lie with Dorcas in a pre&s;s-bed. She &s;hould be very &s;orry, if &s;he had a&s;ked an improper thing: She had never been &s;o put to it before: And Mi&s;s would &s;tay up with <HI>her,</HI> till I had done writing.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this urgency, and it being ea&s;ier to per|&s;i&s;t in a denial <HI>given,</HI> than to give it at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I offered Mi&s;s my whole bed, and to retire into the dining|room, and there, locking my&s;elf in, write all the night.</P>
<P>The poor thing, &s;he &s;aid, was afraid to lie alone. To be &s;ure Mi&s;s Partington would not put me to &s;uch an inconvenience.</P>
<P>She then withdrew: But returned; begged my pardon for returning: But the poor child, &s;he &s;aid, was in tears. Mi&s;s Partington had never &s;een a young lady &s;he &s;o much admired, and &s;o much wi&s;hed to imi|tate, as me. The dear girl hoped that nothing had pa&s;&s;ed in her behaviour, to give me di&s;like to her. Should &s;he bring her to me?</P>
<P>I was very bu&s;y, I &s;aid. The letter I was writing was upon a very important &s;ubject. I hoped to &s;ee Mi&s;s in the morning; when I would apologize to her for my particularity. And then Mrs. Sinclair he&s;i|tating, and moving towards the door (tho' &s;he turned round to me again), I de&s;ired her (lighting her) to take care how &s;he went down.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, on the &s;tairs head, don't give your&s;elf all this trouble. God knows my heart, I meant no affront: But, &s;ince you &s;eem to take my freedom ami&s;s, I beg you will not acquaint Mr. Love|lace
<PB N="330" REF="331">
with it; for he, perhaps, will think me bold and impertinent.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, is not this a particular incident; either as I have made it, or as it was de&s;igned? I don't love to do an uncivil thing. And if nothing were meant by the reque&s;t, my refu&s;al de&s;erves to be called &s;o. Then I have &s;hewn a &s;u&s;picion of foul u&s;age by it, which &s;urely dare not be meant. If ju&s;t, I ought to apprehend every thing, and fly the houfe, and the man, as I would an infection. If not ju&s;t, and if I cannot contrive to clear my&s;elf of having en|tertained &s;u&s;picions, by a&s;&s;igning &s;ome other plau&s;ible rea&s;on for my denial, the very &s;taying here will have an appearance not at all reputable to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am now out of humour with him, with my&s;elf, with all the world but you. His companions are &s;hocking creatures. Why, again I repeat, &s;hould he have been de&s;irous to bring me into &s;uch company? Once more, I like him not. I am, my dear,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, May 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WITH infinite regret I am obliged to tell you, that I can no longer write to you, or receive letters from you. Your mother has &s;ent me a letter inclo&s;ed in a cover to Mr. Lovelace, directed for him at Lord M.'s (and which was brought him ju&s;t now), reproaching me on this &s;ubject in very angry terms, and forbidding me, as I would not be thought to in|tend to make her and you unhappy, to write to you, without her leave.</P>
<P>This, therefore, is the la&s;t you mu&s;t receive from me, till happier times: And as my pro&s;pects are not very bad, I pre&s;ume we &s;hall &s;oon have leave to write
<PB N="331" REF="332">
again; and even to &s;ee each other: Since an alliance with a family &s;o honourable as Mr. Lovelace's is, will not be a di&s;grace.</P>
<P>She is plea&s;ed to write, that if I would wi&s;h to <HI>in|flame</HI> you, I &s;hould let you know her written prohibi|tion: But otherwi&s;e find &s;ome way of my own accord (without bringing <HI>her</HI> into the que&s;tion) to decline a corre&s;pondence, which I mu&s;t know &s;he has for &s;ome time pa&s;t forbidden. But all I can &s;ay, is, to beg of you <HI>not</HI> to be inflamed;&mdash;to beg of you, not to let her <HI>know,</HI> or even by your behaviour to her, on this occa&s;ion, <HI>gue&s;s,</HI> that I have acquainted you with my rea&s;on for declining to write to you. For how el&s;e, after the &s;cruples I have heretofore made on this very &s;ubject, yet proceeding to corre&s;pond, can I hone&s;tly &s;atisfy you about my motives for this &s;udden &s;top? So, my dear, I choo&s;e, you &s;ee, rather to rely upon your di&s;cretion, than to feign rea&s;ons you would not be &s;atisfy'd with, but, with your u&s;ual active pene|tration, &s;ift to the bottom, and at la&s;t find me to be a mean and low qualifier; and that, with an implica|tion injurious to you, that I &s;uppo&s;ed you had not pru|dence enough to be tru&s;ted with the naked truth.</P>
<P>I repeat, that my pro&s;pects are not bad. The hou&s;e, I pre&s;ume, will &s;oon be taken. The people here are very re&s;pectful, notwith&s;tanding my nicety about Mi&s;s Partington. Mi&s;s Martin, who is near mar|riage with an eminent trade&s;man in the Strand, ju&s;t now, in a very re&s;pectful manner, a&s;ked my opinion of &s;ome patterns of rich &s;ilks for the occa&s;ion. The widow has a le&s;s forbidding appearance than at fir&s;t. Mr. Lovelace, on my declared di&s;like of his four friends, has a&s;&s;ured me, that neither they nor any-body el&s;e &s;hall be introduced to me, without my leave.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances I mention, as you will &s;up|po&s;e, that your kind heart may be at ea&s;e about me; that you may be induced by them to acquie&s;ce with your mother's commands, <HI>chearfully</HI> acquie&s;ce, and

<P>I Am a&s;toni&s;hed that my mother &s;hould take &s;uch a &s;tep&mdash;purely to exerci&s;e an unrea&s;onable act of authority; and to oblige the mo&s;t remor&s;ele&s;s hearts in the world. If I find, that I can be of u&s;e to you either by advice or information, do you think I will not give it?&mdash;Were it to any other per&s;on, <HI>le&s;s</HI> dear to me than you are, do you think, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, I would forbear giving it?&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, who pretends to a little ca&s;ui&s;try in &s;uch nice matters, is of opinion, that I ought not to decline a corre&s;pondence thus circum&s;tanced. And 'tis well he is; for my mother having &s;et me up, I mu&s;t have &s;omebody to quarrel with.</P>
<P>This I will come into, if it will make you ea&s;y: I will forbear to write to you for a few days, if nothing extraordinary happen;&mdash;and till the rigour of her pro|hibition is abated. But be a&s;&s;ured, that I will not di|&s;pen&s;e with your writing to me. My heart, my con|&s;cience, my honour, will not permit it.</P>
<P>But how will I help my&s;elf?&mdash;How!&mdash;Ea&s;y enough. For I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I want but very little fur|ther provocation to fly privately to London: And if I do, I will not leave you till I &s;ee you either honour|ably married, or ab&s;olutely quit of the wretch: And in this la&s;t ca&s;e, I will take you down with me, in defiance of the whole world: Or, if you refu&s;e to go with me, &s;tay with you, and accompany you as your &s;hadow whither&s;oever you go.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="334">Don't be frighted at this declaration. There is but one con&s;ideration, and but one hope, that with-hold me; watched as I am in all my retirements; obliged to read to her without a voice; to work in her pre|&s;ence without fingers; and to lie with her every night again&s;t my will. The <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> is, Le&s;t you &s;hould apprehend that a &s;tep of this nature would look like a doubling of your fault, in the eyes of &s;uch as think your going away a fault. The <HI>hope</HI> is, That things will &s;till end happily, and that &s;ome people will have rea&s;on to take &s;hame to them&s;elves for the &s;orry parts they have acted&mdash;Neverthele&s;s I am often ba|lancing. But your re&s;olving to give up the corre&s;pond|ence at this cri&s;is, will turn the &s;cale. Write there|fore, or take the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>A few words upon the &s;ubject of your la&s;t letters.&mdash;I know not whether your brother's wi&s;e project be given up or not. A dead &s;ilence reigns in your fa|mily. Your brother was ab&s;ent three days; then at home one; and is now ab&s;ent: But whether with Singleton or not, I cannot find out.</P>
<P>By your account of your wretch's companions, I &s;ee not but they are a &s;et of infernals, and he the Beelzebub. What could he mean, as you &s;ay, by his earne&s;tne&s;s to bring you into &s;uch company, and to give you &s;uch an opportunity to make him and them reflecting-gla&s;&s;es to one another? The man's a fool, to be &s;ure, my dear.&mdash;A &s;illy fellow, at lea&s;t.&mdash;They mu&s;t put on their <HI>be&s;t</HI> before you, no doubt.&mdash;Lords of the creation!&mdash;Noble fellows the&s;e!&mdash;Yet who knows how many poor de&s;picable &s;ouls of our &s;ex the wor&s;t of them has had to whine after him!</P>
<P>You have brought an inconvenience upon your&s;elf, as you ob&s;erve, by your refu&s;al of Mi&s;s Partington for your bedfellow. Pity you had not admitted her. Watchful as <HI>you</HI> are, what <HI>could</HI> have happened? If violence were intended, he would not &s;tay for the night. You might have &s;at up after her, or not gone
<PB N="334" REF="335">
to bed. Mrs. Sinclair pre&s;&s;ed it too far. You was over-&s;crupulous.</P>
<P>If any thing happens to delay your nuptials, I would advi&s;e you to remove: But if you marry, you may, perhaps, think it no great matter to &s;tay where you are, till you take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your own e&s;tate. The knot once tied, and with &s;o re&s;olute a man, it is my opinion, your relations will &s;oon re&s;ign what they can|not legally hold: And, were even a litigation to fol|low, you will not be <HI>able,</HI> nor ought you to be <HI>will|ing,</HI> to help it: For your e&s;tate will then be his right; and it will be unju&s;t to wi&s;h it to be with-held from him.</P>
<P>One thing I would advi&s;e you to think of; and that is, of proper &s;ettlements: It will be to the credit of your prudence, and of his ju&s;tice (and the more as mat|ters &s;tand), that &s;omething of this &s;hould be done, before you marry. Bad as he is, nobody accounts him a &s;ordid man. And I wonder he has been hither|to &s;ilent on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with his propo&s;al about the widow lady's hou&s;e. I think it will do very well. But if it mu&s;t be three weeks before you can be cer|tain about it; &s;urely you need not put off his day for that &s;pace: And he may be&s;peak his equipages. Sur|pri&s;ing to me, that he could be &s;o acquie&s;cent!</P>
<P>I repeat&mdash;Continue to write to me:&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon it; and that as minutely as po&s;&s;ible: Or, take the con&s;equence. I &s;end this by a particular hand. I am, and ever will be,</P>

<P>MERCURY, as the Fabuli&s;t tells us, having the curio&s;ity to know the e&s;timation he &s;tood in
<PB N="338" REF="339">
among mortals, de&s;cended in di&s;gui&s;e, and, in a &s;ta|tuary's &s;hop, cheapens a Jupiter, then a Juno, then one, then another, of the <HI>Dii majores</HI>; and, at la&s;t, a&s;ks, What price that &s;ame &s;tatue of <HI>Mercury</HI> bore? O, &s;ays the arti&s;t, buy one of the others, Sir; and I'll throw ye in that for nothing. How &s;heepi&s;h mu&s;t the god of thieves look, upon this rebuff to his va|nity!</P>
<P>So thou!&mdash;A thou&s;and pounds would&s;t thou give for the good opinion of this &s;ingle lady: To be only thought tolerably of, and not quite unworthy of her conver&s;ation, would make thee happy: And, at part|ing la&s;t night, or rather this morning, thou made&s;t me promi&s;e a few lines to Edgware, to let thee know, what &s;he thinks of thee, and thy brother varlets.</P>
<P>Thy thou&s;and pounds, Jack, is all thy own: For mo&s;t heartily does &s;he di&s;like ye all: Thee as much as any.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it too, as to thy part; for two rea|&s;ons: <HI>One,</HI> that I think thy motive for thy curio&s;ity was fear, and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s: Whereas that of the arch-thief was vanity, intolerable vanity: And he was therefore ju&s;tly &s;ent away with a blu&s;h upon his cheeks to heaven, and could not brag: The <HI>other</HI>; that I am afraid, if &s;he di&s;likes <HI>thee,</HI> &s;he di&s;likes <HI>me:</HI> For are we not birds of a feather?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t never talk of reformation, &s;he told me, having &s;uch companions, and taking &s;uch delight as I &s;eemed to take, in their frothy conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I, no more than you, imagined &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly like ye: But then, as <HI>my</HI> friends, I thought a per&s;on of her education would have been more &s;paring of her cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>I don't know how it is, Belford; but women think them&s;elves intitled to take any freedoms with <HI>us</HI>; while we are unpolite, for&s;ooth, and I can't tell what, if we don't tell a pack of cur&s;ed lyes, and make black

white, in <HI>their</HI> favour&mdash;teaching us to be hypocrites, yet &s;tigmatizing us, at other times, for deceivers.</P>
<P>I defended ye all, as well as I could: But you know, there was no attempting ought but a palliative defence, to one of her principles. I will &s;ummarily give thee a few of my pleas.</P>
<P>To the <HI>pure,</HI> every little deviation &s;eemed offen|&s;ive: Yet I &s;aw not, that there was any thing ami&s;s the whole evening, either in your words or behaviour. Some people could talk but upon <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> &s;ubjects: She upon every-one: No wonder, therefore, <HI>they</HI> talked to what they under&s;tood be&s;t; and to mere objects of &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Had &s;he honour'd us with more of <HI>her</HI> conver&s;ation, &s;he would have been le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ted with <HI>ours</HI>; for &s;he &s;aw how every-one was prepared to admire her, whenever &s;he opened her lips. You, in particular, had &s;aid, when &s;he retired, that virtue it&s;elf &s;poke, when &s;he &s;poke: But that you had &s;uch an awe upon you, after &s;he had favoured us with an ob&s;ervation or two on a &s;ubject &s;tarted, that you &s;hould ever be afraid, in her company, to be found <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ex|ceptionable, when you intended to be <HI>lea&s;t</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>Plainly, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he neither liked my companions, nor the hou&s;e &s;he was in.</P>
<P>I liked not the hou&s;e any more than &s;he: Tho' the people were very obliging, and &s;he had owned they were le&s;s exceptionable to her&s;elf, than at fir&s;t: And were we not about another of our own?</P>
<P>She did not like Mi&s;s Partington: Let her fortune be what it would, &s;he &s;hould not choo&s;e an intimacy with her. She thought it was a hard&s;hip to be put upon &s;uch a difficulty, as &s;he was put upon the pre|ceding night, when there were lodgers in the front-hou&s;e, whom they had rea&s;on to be freer with, than, upon &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance, with her.</P>
<P>I pretended to be an utter &s;tranger as to this parti|cular; and, when &s;he explained her&s;elf upon it, con|demned the reque&s;t, and call'd it a confident one.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="341">She, <HI>artfully,</HI> made lighter of her denial of Mi&s;s for a bedfellow, than &s;he <HI>thought</HI> of it, I could &s;ee that; for it was plain, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed there was room for me to think &s;he had been either over-<HI>nice,</HI> or over-<HI>cautious.</HI></P>
<P>I offered to re&s;ent Mrs. Sinclair's freedom.</P>
<P>No; there was no great matter in it: It was be&s;t to let it pa&s;s: It might be thought more particular in her to <HI>deny,</HI> than in Mrs. Sinclair to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> or Mi&s;s to <HI>ex|pect:</HI> But as the people below had a large acquaint|ance, &s;he did not know how much &s;he might have her retirements invaded, if &s;he gave way. And in|deed there were levities in Mi&s;s's behaviour, which &s;he could not &s;o far pa&s;s over, as to wi&s;h an intimacy with her. But if &s;he were &s;uch a va&s;t fortune, &s;he could not but &s;ay, that Mi&s;s &s;eemed a much more &s;uitable per&s;on for me to make my addre&s;&s;es to, than&mdash;</P>
<P>Interrupting her, with gravity, I &s;aid I liked Mi&s;s Partington as little as <HI>&s;he could</HI> like her. She was a &s;illy young creature; who &s;eemed too likely to ju&s;tify her guardians watchfulne&s;s over her. But, neverthe|le&s;s, as to her general conver&s;ation and behaviour la&s;t night, I mu&s;t own, that I thought the girl (for <HI>girl</HI> &s;he was, as to di&s;cretion) not exceptionable; only car|rying her&s;elf as a free good-natured creature, who thought her&s;elf &s;ecure in the honour of her com|pany.</P>
<P>It was very well &s;aid of me, &s;he replied: But, if Mi&s;s were &s;o <HI>well</HI> &s;atisfied with her company, &s;he left it to me, whether I was not very kind to &s;uppo&s;e her &s;uch an <HI>innocent</HI>&mdash;For her own part, &s;he had &s;een nothing of the London world: But thought, &s;he mu&s;t tell me plainly, that &s;he never was in &s;uch company in her life; nor ever again wi&s;h'd to be in it.</P>
<P>There, Belford!&mdash;Wor&s;e off than Mercury!&mdash;Art thou not?</P>
<P>I was nettled. Hard would be the lot of <HI>more</HI> di&s;|creet ladies, as far as I knew, than Mi&s;s Partington, were they to be judged by &s;o rigid a virtue as hers.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="342">Not &s;o, &s;he &s;aid: But if I really &s;aw nothing excep|tionable to a virtuous mind, in that young lady's be|haviour, <HI>my</HI> ignorance of <HI>better</HI> behaviour was, &s;he mu&s;t needs tell me, as pitiable as <HI>hers:</HI> And it were to be wi&s;hed, that minds <HI>&s;o</HI> paired, for their <HI>own</HI> &s;akes, &s;hould never be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>See, Jack, what I get by my charity!</P>
<P>I thank'd her heartily. But I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that good folks were generally &s;o uncharit|able, that, devil take me, if I would choo&s;e to be good, were the con&s;equence to be, that I mu&s;t think hardly of the whole world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>She congratulated me upon my charity: But told me, that, to enlarge her <HI>own,</HI> &s;he hoped it would not be expected of her to approve of the low company I had brought her into la&s;t night.</P>
<P>No exception for thee, Belford! Safe is thy thou|&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>I &s;aw not, I &s;aid, begging her pardon, that &s;he liked <HI>any-body</HI> [Plain-dealing for plain-dealing!&mdash;Why then did &s;he abu&s;e my friends?&mdash;<HI>Love me, and love my dogs,</HI> as Lord M. would &s;ay].&mdash;However, let me but know, whom, and what, &s;he did, or did not like; and, if po&s;&s;ible, I would like, and di&s;like, the very &s;ame per&s;ons and things.</P>
<P>She bid me then, in a pet, <HI>di&s;like my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Cur&s;ed &s;evere!&mdash;Does &s;he think &s;he mu&s;t not pay for it one day, or one night?&mdash;And if <HI>one, many</HI>; that's my comfort!</P>
<P>I was in a train of being &s;o happy, I &s;aid, before my earne&s;tne&s;s to procure her to favour my friends with her company, that I wi&s;h'd the devil had had as well my friends, as Mi&s;s Partington&mdash;And yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I &s;aw not how good people could an&s;wer half their end, which was, by their example, to amend the world, were they to accompany <HI>only</HI> with the good.</P>
<P>I had like to have been bla&s;ted by two or three
<PB N="342" REF="343">
fla&s;hes of lightning from her indignant eyes; and &s;he turned &s;cornfully from me, and retired to her own apartment.&mdash;Once more, Jack, &s;afe, as thou &s;ee&s;t, is thy thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;She &s;ays, I am not a polite man&mdash;But is &s;he, in the in&s;tance before us, more po|lite for a lady?</P>
<P>And now, do&s;t thou not think, that I owe my charmer &s;ome revenge for her cruelty, in obliging &s;uch a fine young creature, and &s;o va&s;t a fortune, as Mi&s;s Partington, to croud into a pre&s;s-bed with her maid-&s;ervant Dorcas!&mdash;Mi&s;s Partington too (with tears) declaring by Mrs. Sinclair, that, would Mrs. Lovelace honour her at Barnet, the be&s;t bed and be&s;t room in her guardian's hou&s;e &s;hould be at her &s;ervice.&mdash;Thinke&s;t thou, that I could not gue&s;s at her di&s;|honourable fears of me!&mdash;That &s;he apprehended, that the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>hu&s;band</HI> would endeavour to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>his own?</HI>&mdash;And that Mi&s;s Partington would be willing to contribute to &s;uch a piece of ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>Thus, then, thou both reminde&s;t, and defie&s;t me, charmer!&mdash;And &s;ince thou relie&s;t more on thy own precaution than upon my honour; be it unto thee as thou apprehende&s;t, fair one!</P>
<P>And now, Jack, let me know, what thy opinion, and the opinions of thy brother varlets, are of my Gloriana.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now heard, that her Hannah hopes to be &s;oon well enough to attend her young lady, when in London. It &s;eems the girl has had no phy&s;ician. I mu&s;t &s;end her one, out of pure love and re&s;pect to her mi&s;tre&s;s. Who knows but medicine may weaken nature, and &s;trengthen the di&s;ea&s;e?&mdash;As her malady is not a fever, very likely it may do &s;o.&mdash;But perhaps her hopes are too forward. Blu&s;tering weather in this month yet&mdash;And that is bad for rheumatic com|plaints.</P>

<P>JUST as I had &s;ealed up the inclo&s;ed, comes a let|ter to my beloved, in a cover to me, directed to Lord M.'s. From whom, thinke&s;t thou?&mdash;From Mrs. Howe!&mdash;</P>
<P>And what the contents!</P>
<P>How &s;hould I know, unle&s;s the dear creature had communicated them to me? But a very cruel letter I believe it is, by the effect it had upon her. The tears ran down her checks as &s;he read it; and her co|lour changed &s;everal times. No end of her per&s;ecu|tions, I think.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What a cruelty in her &s;ate!'</Q> &s;aid the &s;weet la|menter.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Now the only comfort of her life mu&s;t be given up!'</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe's corre&s;pondence, no doubt.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;he be &s;o much grieved at this? This corre&s;pondence was prohibited before, and that, to the daughter, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms: But yet carried on by <HI>both:</HI> Altho' a brace of impeccables, and plea&s;e ye. Could they expect, that a mother would not vindicate her authority?&mdash;And finding her prohibition ineffectual with her perver&s;e <HI>daughter,</HI> was it not rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would try what effect it would have upon her <HI>daughter</HI>'s <HI>friend?</HI>&mdash;And now I be|lieve the end will be effectually an&s;wer'd: For my beloved, I dare &s;ay, will make a point of con&s;cience of it.</P>
<P>I hate cruelty, e&s;pecially in <HI>women</HI>; and &s;hould have been more concerned for this in&s;tance of it in Mrs. Howe, had I not had a &s;tronger in&s;tance of the &s;ame in my beloved to Mi&s;s Partington; for how did &s;he know, &s;ince &s;he was &s;o much afraid for her&s;elf,

But neverthele&s;s I mu&s;t needs own, that I am not very &s;orry for this prohibition, let it originally come from the Harlowes, or from whom it will; becau&s;e I make no doubt, that it is owing to Mi&s;s Howe, in a great mea&s;ure, that my beloved is &s;o much upon her guard, and thinks &s;o hardly of me. And who can tell, as characters here are &s;o tender, and &s;ome di&s;gui&s;es &s;o flim&s;y, what con&s;equences might follow this undutiful corre&s;pondence?&mdash;I &s;ay, there|fore, I am not &s;orry for it: Now will &s;he have no|body to compare notes with: No-body to alarm her: And I may be &s;aved the guilt and di&s;obligation of in|&s;pecting into a corre&s;pondence that has long made me unea&s;y.</P>
<P>How every thing works for me!&mdash;Why will this charming creature make &s;uch contrivances nece&s;&s;ary, as will increa&s;e my trouble, and my guilt too, as &s;ome would account it? But why, rather I would a&s;k, will &s;he fight again&s;t her &s;tars?&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Edgware,
<DATE>Tue&s;day-night, May 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WIthout &s;taying for the promi&s;ed letter from you to inform us what the lady &s;ays of <HI>us,</HI> I write to tell you, That we are all of <HI>one</HI> opinion with regard to <HI>her</HI>; which is, that there is not of her age a finer lady in the world, as to her under&s;tanding. As for her per&s;on, &s;he is at the age of bloom, and an admir|able creature; a perfect beauty: But this <HI>poorer</HI> prai&s;e a man can hardly de&s;cend to give, who has been ho|nour'd with her conver&s;ation; and yet &s;he was brought among&s;t us again&s;t her will.</P>
<P>Permit me, dear Lovelace, to be a means of &s;aving this excellent creature from the dangers &s;he hourly runs from the mo&s;t plotting heart in the world. In
<PB N="345" REF="346">
a former, I pleaded your own family, Lord M.'s wi&s;hes particularly; and then I had not &s;een her: But now, I join her &s;ake, honour's &s;ake, motives of ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, gratitude, and humanity, which are all concern'd in the pre&s;ervation of &s;o fine a crea|ture.&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t not the angui&s;h I &s;hould have had (whence ari&s;ing, I cannot devi&s;e), had I not known before I &s;et out this morning, that the in|comparable creature had di&s;appointed thee in thy cur&s;ed view of getting her to admit the &s;pecious Par|tington for a bedfellow!</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o awful, and yet &s;o &s;weet, in this lady's a&s;pect [I have done nothing but talk of her ever &s;ince I &s;aw her], that were I to have the Virtues and the Graces all drawn in one piece, they &s;hould be taken, every one of them, from different airs and at|titudes in her. She was born to adorn the age &s;he was given to, and would be an ornament to the fir&s;t dignity. What a piercing, yet gentle eye, every glance, I thought, mingled with love and fear of you: What a &s;weet &s;mile darting through the cloud that over&s;pread her fair face; demon&s;trating, that &s;he had more apprehen&s;ions and grief at her heart, than &s;he cared to expre&s;s!</P>
<P>You may think what I am going to write too flighty; but, by my faith, I have conceived &s;uch a profound reverence for her &s;en&s;e and judgment, that, far from thinking the man excu&s;able who &s;hould treat her ba&s;ely, I am ready to regret that &s;uch an angel of a lady &s;hould even marry. She is, in my eye, all mind: And were &s;he to meet with a man all mind likewi&s;e, why &s;hould the charming qualities &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of, be endangered? Why &s;hould &s;uch an angel be plunged &s;o low as into the vulgar offices of dome&s;tic life? Were &s;he mine, I &s;hould hardly wi&s;h to &s;ee her a mother, unle&s;s there were a kind of mo|ral certainty, that minds like hers could be propagated. For why, in &s;hort, &s;hould not the work of bodies be
<PB N="346" REF="347">
left to <HI>mere</HI> bodies? I know, that you your&s;elf have an opinion of this lady little le&s;s exalted than mine. Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, are all of my mind; are full of her prai&s;es; and &s;wear, it would be a million of pities to ruin a lady, in who&s;e fall none but devils can rejoice.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t that merit and excellence be, that can extort this from <HI>us,</HI> free livers, like your&s;elf, and all of us your partial friends, who have joined with you in your ju&s;t re&s;entments again&s;t the re&s;t of her family, and offered our a&s;&s;i&s;tance to execute your ven|geance on them? But we cannot think it rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould puni&s;h an innocent lady, who loves you &s;o well; and who is in your protection, and has &s;uf|fered &s;o much for you, for the faults of her relations.</P>
<P>And here, let me put a &s;erious que&s;tion, or two. Thinke&s;t thou, truly admirable as this lady is, that the end thou propo&s;e&s;t to thy&s;elf, if obtained, is an|&s;werable to the means, to the trouble thou give&s;t thy|&s;elf, and the perfidies, tricks, &s;tratagems, and con|trivances thou ha&s;t already been guilty of, and &s;till meditate&s;t? In every real excellence &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;es all her &s;ex. But in the article thou &s;eeke&s;t to &s;ubdue her for, a mere &s;en&s;uali&s;t of her &s;ex, a Partington, a Horton, a Martin, would make a &s;en&s;uali&s;t a thou|&s;and times happier than &s;he either will or can.
<Q>Sweet are the joys that come with willingne&s;s.</Q>
And would&s;t thou make her unhappy for her whole life, and thy&s;elf not happy for a &s;ingle moment?</P>
<P>Hitherto, it is not too late; and that, perhaps, is as much as can be &s;aid, if thou meane&s;t to pre&s;erve her e&s;teem and good opinion, as well as per&s;on; for I think it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he can get out of thy hands, now &s;he is in this cur&s;ed hou&s;e: O that damn'd hypocritical <HI>Sinclair,</HI> as thou calle&s;t her! How was it po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould behave &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly as &s;he did, all the time the lady &s;taid with us! Be hone&s;t, and marry; and be

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, May 3.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with my views, de&s;igns, and re&s;olutions, with regard to this admirable creature, it is very ex|traordinary, that thou &s;hould&s;t vapour as thou do&s;t, in her behalf, when I have made no trial, no attempt: And yet, give&s;t it as thy opinion in a former letter, that advantage may be taken of the &s;ituation &s;he is in; and that &s;he may be overcome.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of thy reflections, particularly that, which re&s;pects the difference as to the joys to be given by
<PB N="348" REF="349">
the Virtuous and the Libertine of the &s;ex, are fitter to come in as after-reflections, than as <HI>antecedencies.</HI></P>
<P>I own with thee, and with the poet, <HI>That &s;weet are the joys that come with willingne&s;s</HI>&mdash;But is it to be ex|pected, that a woman of education, and a lover of forms, will yield before &s;he is attacked?&mdash;And have I &s;o much as &s;ummon'd This to &s;urrender?&mdash;I doubt not but I &s;hall meet with difficulty. I mu&s;t therefore make my fir&s;t effort by &s;urprize.&mdash;There may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome cruelty nece&s;&s;ary. But there may be con&s;ent in &s;truggle; there may be yielding in re&s;i&s;tance: But the fir&s;t conflict over, whether the following may not be weaker and weaker, till <HI>willingne&s;s</HI> follow, is the point to be try'd.&mdash;I will illu&s;trate what I have &s;aid by the &s;imile of a bird new-caught. We begin with birds, as boys, and, as men, go on to ladies; and both perhaps, in turns, experience our &s;portive cruelty.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou not ob&s;erved the charming gradations, by which the in&s;nared volatile has been brought to bear with its new condition? How at fir&s;t, refu&s;ing all &s;u&s;tenance, it beats and brui&s;es it&s;elf again&s;t its wires, till it makes its gay plumage fly about, and over&s;pread its well-&s;ecured cage. Now it gets out its head; &s;ticking only at its beautiful &s;houlders: Then, with difficulty, drawing back its head, it ga&s;ps for breath, and erectedly perched, with meditating eyes, fir&s;t &s;urveys, and then attempts, its wired cano|py. As it gets breath, with renew'd rage, it beats and brui&s;es again its pretty head and &s;ides, bites the wires, and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer. Till at la&s;t, finding its efforts ineffectual, quite tired and breathle&s;s, it lays it&s;elf down, and pants at the bottom of the cage, &s;eeming to bemoan its cruel fate and forfeited liberty. And after a few days, its &s;truggles to e&s;cape &s;till dimini&s;hing, as it finds it to no purpo&s;e to attempt it, its new habitation becomes familiar; and it hops about from perch to perch, re&s;umes its
<PB N="349" REF="350">
wonted chearfulne&s;s, and every day &s;ings a &s;ong to amu&s;e it&s;elf, and reward its keeper.</P>
<P>Now, let me tell thee, that I have known a bird actually &s;tarve it&s;elf, and die with grief, at its being caught and caged&mdash;But never did I meet with a lady who was &s;o &s;illy.&mdash;Yet have I heard the dear &s;ouls mo&s;t vehemently threaten their own lives on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion. But it is &s;aying nothing in a woman's favour, if we do not allow her to have more &s;en&s;e than a bird. And yet we mu&s;t all own, that it is more diffi|cult to catch a bird than a lady.</P>
<P>And now, Belford, were I to go no further, how &s;hall I know whether this &s;weet bird may not be brought to &s;ing me a fine &s;ong, and, in time, to be as well contented with her condition as I have brought other birds to be; &s;ome of them very &s;hy ones?</P>
<P>But I gue&s;s at thy principal motive in this thy ear|ne&s;tne&s;s in behalf of this charming creature. I know that thou corre&s;ponde&s;t with Lord M. who is impa|tient, and long has been de&s;irous, to &s;ee me &s;hackled. And thou wante&s;t to build up a merit with that noble podagra-man, with a view to one of his nieces. But knowe&s;t thou not, that my con&s;ent will be wanting to complete it?&mdash;And what a commendation will it be of thee to &s;uch a girl as Charlotte, when I &s;hall ac|quaint her with the affront thou putte&s;t upon the whole &s;ex, by a&s;king, whether I think my reward, when I have &s;ubdued the mo&s;t charming woman in the world, will be equal to my trouble?&mdash;Which, thinke&s;t thou, a woman of &s;pirit will &s;oone&s;t forgive, the undervaluing varlet who can put &s;uch a que&s;tion; or him, who prefers the pur&s;uit and conque&s;t of a fine woman to all the joys of life?&mdash;Have I not known even a virtuous woman, as &s;he would be thought, vow everla&s;ting antipathy to a man, who gave out, that &s;he was too old for him to attempt?</P>
<P>But another word or two, as to thy objection re|lating to my trouble and my reward.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="351">Does not the keen foxhunter endanger his neck and his bones in pur&s;uit of a vermin, which, when killed, is neither fit food for men nor dogs?</P>
<P>Do not the hunters of the nobler game value the veni&s;on le&s;s than the &s;port?</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould I be reflected upon, and the Sex affronted, for my patience and per&s;everance in the mo&s;t noble of all chaces; and for not being a poacher in love, as thy que&s;tion may be made to imply?</P>

For the future therefore cor|rect thy &s;tile, and proclaim her the ornament of the happie&s;t man, and (re&s;pecting her&s;elf and Sex) the greate&s;t conqueror in the world.</P>
<P>Then, that &s;he loves me, as thou imagine&s;t, by no means appears clear to me.&mdash;Her conditional of|fers
<PB N="351" REF="352">
to renounce me; the little confidence &s;he places in me; intitle me to a&s;k, What merit can &s;he have with a man, who won her in &s;pight of her&s;elf; and who fairly, in &s;et and ob&s;tinate battle, took her pri|&s;oner?</P>
<P>As to what thou inferre&s;t from her eye when with us, thou knowe&s;t nothing of her heart from that, if thou imagine&s;t, there was one glance of love &s;hot from it. Well did I note her eye, and plainly did I &s;ee, that it was all but ju&s;t civil di&s;gu&s;t to me and to the company I had brought her into. Her early re|tiring that night again&s;t all intreaty, might have con|vinced thee, that there was very little of the gentle in her heart for me. And her eye never knew what it was to contradict her heart.</P>
<P>She is thou &s;aye&s;t, <HI>All mind.</HI> So &s;ay I. But why &s;hould&s;t thou imagine, that &s;uch a mind as hers, meeting with &s;uch a one as mine; and, to dwell upon the word, meeting with an inclination in hers to <HI>meet,</HI> &s;hould not propagate minds like her own?</P>
<P>No doubt of it, as thou &s;aye&s;t, The devils would rejoice in the fall of &s;uch a lady. But this is my con|fidence, that I &s;hall have it in my power to marry when I will. And if I do her this ju&s;tice, &s;hall I not have a claim to her gratitude? And will &s;he not think her&s;elf the Obliged, rather than the Obliger? Then, let me tell thee, Belford, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;o far to hurt the morals of this lady, as thou and thy brother-varlets have hurt others of the Sex, who now are ca&s;ting about the town firebrands and double death.&mdash;Take ye that thi&s;tle to mumble upon.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, tell me, that among all the objects of your re&s;pective attempts, there was not one of the rank and merit of my charming Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k, Has it not been a con&s;tant maxim with us, that the greater the <HI>merit</HI> on the woman's &s;ide, the nobler the victory on the man's?&mdash;And as to <HI>rank,</HI> &s;en&s;e of honour, &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, pride of fa|mily,

<P>But a <HI>poor</HI> girl; &s;uch a one as my <HI>Ro&s;ebud</HI> for in|&s;tance; having no recalls from education&mdash;Being driven out of every family that pretends to reputation; per&s;ecuted mo&s;t perhaps by &s;uch as have only kept their &s;ecret better; and having no refuge to fly to&mdash;The common, the &s;tews, the &s;treet, is the fate of &s;uch a poor wretch; penury, want, and di&s;ea&s;e, her &s;ure attendants; and an untimely end perhaps clo&s;es the mi&s;erable &s;cene.</P>
<P>And will ye not now all join to &s;ay, that it is more manly to attack a lion than a &s;heep?&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t, that I always illu&s;trated my eagle&s;hip, by aiming at the noble&s;t quarries; and by di&s;daining to make a &s;toup at wrens, <HI>phil</HI>-tits, and wagtails.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t, re&s;pecting my&s;elf, in the ca&s;e before me, is, that my triumph, when completed, will be &s;o glorious a one, that I &s;hall never be able to keep up to it. All my future attempts mu&s;t be poor to this. I &s;hall be as unhappy after a while, from my re|flections upon this conque&s;t, as Don John of Au&s;tria was, in his, on the renowned victory of Lepanto, when he found, that none of his future atchievements could keep pace with his early glory.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that my pleas and my rea&s;onings may be ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd, and perhaps ju&s;tly cen&s;ured; but by whom cen&s;ured? Not by any of the Confraternity,

<P>I Know that thou art &s;o abandoned a man, that to give thee the be&s;t rea&s;ons in the world again&s;t what thou ha&s;t once re&s;olved upon, will be but acting the madman, whom once we &s;aw trying to buffet down a hurricane with his hat. I hope, however, that the Lady's merit will &s;till avail her with thee. But if thou per&s;i&s;te&s;t; if thou wilt avenge thy&s;elf on this &s;weet lamb, which thou ha&s;t &s;ingled out from a flock thou hate&s;t, for the faults of the dogs who kept it: If thou art not to be moved by beauty, by learning, by prudence, by innocence, all &s;hining out in one charm|ing object; but &s;he mu&s;t fall; fall by the man whom &s;he has cho&s;en for her protector; I would not for a thou&s;and worlds have thy crime to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>Upon my faith, Lovelace, the &s;ubject &s;ticks with me, notwith&s;tanding I find I have not the honour of the Lady's good opinion. And the more, when I re|flect upon her father's brutal cur&s;e, and the villainous hard-heartedne&s;s of all her family.&mdash;But, neverthele&s;s, I &s;hould be de&s;irous to know (if thou wilt proceed) by what gradations, arts, and contrivances, thou effecte&s;t thy ingrateful purpo&s;e.&mdash;And, O Lovelace, I conjure thee, if thou art a <HI>man,</HI> let not the &s;pecious devils
<PB N="354" REF="355">
thou ha&s;t brought her among, be &s;uffered to triumph over her; nor make her the victim of unmanly artifices, If &s;he yield to <HI>fair &s;eduction,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my|&s;elf; if thou can&s;t rai&s;e a weakne&s;s in her by love, or by arts not inhuman; I &s;hall the le&s;s pity her. And &s;hall then conclude, that there is not a woman in the world who can re&s;i&s;t a bold and re&s;olute lover.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;enger is ju&s;t now arrived from my uncle. The mortification, it &s;eems, is got up to his knee; and the &s;urgeons declare, that he cannot live many days. He therefore &s;ends for me directly, with the&s;e &s;hocking words, That I will come and clo&s;e his eyes. My &s;ervant, or his, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, be in town every-day on his ca&s;e, or on other affairs, and one of them &s;hall regularly attend you for any letter or com|mands: And it will be charity to write to me as often as you can. For altho' I am likely to be a con&s;ider|able gainer by the poor man's death, yet I can't &s;ay, that I at all love the&s;e &s;cenes of Death and the Doctor &s;o near me. The <HI>Doctor</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> I &s;hould have &s;aid; for that's the natural order; and, generally &s;peaking, the one is but the harbinger to the other.</P>
<P>If therefore you decline to oblige me, I &s;hall think you are di&s;plea&s;ed with my freedom. But let me tell you at the &s;ame time, that no man has a right to be di&s;plea&s;ed at freedoms taken with him for faults he is not a&s;hamed to be guilty of.</P>

<P>She then gives the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf and Mr. Lovelace, on Tue&s;day morning, in

</TEXT></P>
<P>He is con&s;tantly accu&s;ing me of over-&s;crupulou&s;|ne&s;s. He &s;ays, I am always out of humour with him. That I could not have behaved more re&s;ervedly to Mr. Solmes: And that it is contrary to all his hopes and notions, that he &s;hould not, in &s;o long a time, find him&s;elf able to in&s;pire the per&s;on whom he hoped &s;o &s;oon to have the honour to call his, with the lea&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing tenderne&s;s for him beforehand.</P>
<P>Silly and partial incroacher! not to know to what to attribute the re&s;erve I am forced to treat him with. But his pride has eaten up his prudence. It is indeed a dirty low pride, that has &s;wallowed up the <HI>true</HI> pride, which &s;hould have &s;et him above the vanity that has over-run him. Have you not beheld the man, when I was your happy gue&s;t, as he walked to his chariot, looking about him, as if to ob&s;erve what eyes his &s;pe|cious per&s;on and air had attracted? But indeed we have &s;een homely coxcombs as proud as if they had per&s;ons to be proud of; at the &s;ame time, that it was apparent, that the pains they took about them&s;elves but the more expo&s;ed their defects.&mdash;The man who is fond of being thought <HI>more</HI> or <HI>better</HI> than he <HI>is,</HI> as I have often thought, but provokes a &s;crutiny into his preten&s;ions; and that generally produces contempt. For pride, as I believe I have heretofore ob&s;erved, is an infallible &s;ign of weakne&s;s; of &s;omething wrong in the head or heart. He that exalts him&s;elf, in&s;ults his neigh|bour; who is provoked to que&s;tion in him even that merit, which, were he mode&s;t, would perhaps be al|lowed to be his due.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, that I am very grave: And &s;o I am. Mr. Lovelace is extremely &s;unk in my opinion &s;ince Monday night: Nor &s;ee I before me any thing that
<PB N="356" REF="357">
can afford me a plea&s;ing hope. For what, with a mind &s;o unequal as his, can be my be&s;t hope?</P>
<P>I think I mentioned to you, in my former, that my cloaths were brought me. You flutter'd me &s;o, that I am not &s;ure I did. But I know I de&s;ign'd it. They were brought me on Thur&s;day; but neither my few guineas with them, nor any of my books, except a <HI>Drexelius on Eternity,</HI> the good old <HI>Practice of Piety,</HI> and a <HI>Francis Spira.</HI> My brother's wit, I &s;uppo&s;e. He thinks he does well to point out death and de&s;pair to me. I wi&s;h for the one, and every now-and-then, am on the brink of the other.</P>
<P>You will the le&s;s wonder at my being &s;o very &s;o|lemn, when, added to the above, and to my uncertain &s;ituation, I tell you, that they have &s;ent me with the&s;e books a letter from my cou&s;in Morden.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIX. To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Florence, <DATE>April 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the re&s;t of a family, &s;o near and dear to me, and <HI>You</HI> &s;till dearer to me than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in James has acquainted me with the offers you have had, and your refu&s;als. I wonder not at either. Such charming promi&s;es at &s;o early an age, as when I left England; and tho&s;e promi&s;es, as I have often heard, &s;o greatly exceeded, as well in your per|&s;on as mind, how much mu&s;t you be admir'd! How few mu&s;t there be worthy of you!</P>
<P>Your parents, the mo&s;t indulgent in the world, to a child the mo&s;t de&s;erving, have given way, it &s;eems, to your refu&s;als of &s;everal gentlemen:&mdash;They have
<PB N="357" REF="358">
contented them&s;elves at la&s;t to name One with <HI>earne&s;t|ne&s;s</HI> to you, becau&s;e of the addre&s;s of Another they cannot approve of.</P>
<P>They had not rea&s;on, it &s;eems, from your beha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iour, to think you greatly aver&s;e; &s;o they proceed|ed:&mdash;Perhaps too ha&s;tily for a delicacy like yours. But when all was fixed on their parts, and mo&s;t ex|traordinary terms concluded in your favour; terms, which abundantly &s;hew the gentleman's ju&s;t value for you; you fly off with a warmth and vehemence little &s;uited to that &s;weetne&s;s which gave grace to all your actions.</P>
<P>I know very little of either of the gentlemen: But of Mr. Lovelace I know more than of Mr. Solmes. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, more to his advantage than I can. As to every qualification but <HI>one,</HI> your brother owns there is no compari&s;on:&mdash;But That <HI>one</HI> outweighs all the re&s;t together&mdash;It cannot be thought, that Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe will di&s;pen&s;e with MORALS in a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>What, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, &s;hall I fir&s;t plead to you on this occa&s;ion? Your duty, your intere&s;t, your temporal, and your eternal welfare, do, and may all depend upon this &s;ingle point, <HI>The morality of a hu&s;|band.</HI> A wife cannot always have it in her power to <HI>be</HI> good, or to <HI>do</HI> good, if &s;he has a wicked hu&s;band, as a good hu&s;band may, if he has a bad wife.&mdash;You pre&s;erve all your religious regards, I under&s;tand;&mdash;I wonder not that you do: I &s;hould have wonder'd, had you not: But what can you promi&s;e your&s;elf, as to per&s;everance in them, with an immoral hu&s;band?</P>
<P>If your parents and you differ in &s;entiment on this important occa&s;ion, let me a&s;k you, my dear cou&s;in, who ought to give way?&mdash;I own to you, that I &s;hould have thought there could not any-where have been a more &s;uitable match for you, than with Mr. Lovelace, had he been a moral man. I &s;hould have very little to &s;ay again&s;t a man, of who&s;e actions I
<PB N="358" REF="359">
am not to &s;et up my&s;elf as a judge, did he not addre&s;s my cou&s;in. But, on this occa&s;ion, let me tell you, my dear Clari&s;&s;a, that Mr. Lovelace cannot po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve you. He <HI>may</HI> reform, you'll &s;ay; but he may <HI>not.</HI> Habit is not &s;oon &s;hook off. Libertines, who are libertines in defiance of talents, of &s;uperior lights, of conviction, hardly ever reform but by mi|racle, or by incapacity. Well do I know my own &s;ex. Well am I able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man, who has not been fa&s;ten'd upon by &s;ickne&s;s, by affliction, by calamity: Who has a pro&s;perous run of fortune be|fore him: His &s;pirits high: His will uncontroulable: The company he keeps, perhaps &s;uch as him&s;elf, con|firming him in all his cour&s;es, a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in all his enterprizes.</P>
<P>As to the other gentleman, &s;uppo&s;e, my dear cou|&s;in, you don't like him at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> it is far from being unlikely, that you will <HI>hereafter:</HI> Perhaps the more, for not liking him <HI>now.</HI> He can hardly &s;ink <HI>lower</HI> in your opinion: He may <HI>ri&s;e.</HI> Very &s;eldom is it, that <HI>high</HI> expectations are &s;o much as <HI>tolerably</HI> an&s;wered. How indeed <HI>can</HI> they, when a fine and exten&s;ive ima|gination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality, in the highe&s;t of our &s;ublunary enjoyments? A lady adorn'd with &s;uch an imagination &s;ees no de|fect in a favour'd object, becau&s;e &s;he is not con&s;cious of any in her&s;elf, till it is too late to rectify the mi&s;|takes occa&s;ioned by her generous credulity.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents; who, in this ca&s;e, can be &s;o happy in <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> as Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe? What delight do you take in doing good? How hap|pily do you devote the &s;everal portions of the natural day to your own improvement, and to the advantage of all that move within your &s;phere?&mdash;And then &s;uch is your ta&s;te, &s;uch are your acquirements in the po|liter &s;tudies, and in the politer amu&s;ements; &s;uch
<PB N="359" REF="360">
your excellence in all the different parts of oeconomy, fit for a young lady's in&s;pection and practice, that your friends would wi&s;h you to be taken off, as little as po&s;|&s;ible, by regards that might be called merely <HI>per&s;onal?</HI></P>
<P>But as to what may be the con&s;equence re&s;pecting your&s;elf, re&s;pecting a young lady of your exalted ta|lents, from the preference you are &s;u&s;pected to give to a libertine, I would have you, my dear cou&s;in, con&s;ider what That may be.&mdash;A mind &s;o pure, to mingle with a mind more impure than mo&s;t of his &s;pecies! Such a man as This will ingro&s;s all your &s;olicitudes. He will perpetually fill you with anxieties for him and for your&s;elf. The divine and civil powers defied, and their &s;anctions broke thro' by him, on every not merely <HI>accidental,</HI> but <HI>meditated</HI> occa&s;ion. To be agreeable to him, and to hope to pre&s;erve an intere&s;t in his af|fections, you mu&s;t probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pur&s;uits. You mu&s;t enter into his plea&s;ures and di&s;ta&s;tes: You mu&s;t give up your own virtuous companions for his profligate ones: Perhaps be for&s;aken by yours, becau&s;e of the &s;candal he daily gives. Can you hope, cou&s;in, with &s;uch a man as This, to be <HI>long</HI> &s;o good as you <HI>now</HI> are?&mdash;If not, con&s;ider, which of your pre&s;ent laudable delights you would choo&s;e to give up?&mdash;Which of his culpable ones to follow him in? How could you brook to go back|ward, in&s;tead of forward, in tho&s;e duties which you now &s;o exemplarily perform? And how do you know, if you once give way, where you &s;hall be &s;uf|fer'd, where you &s;hall be <HI>able,</HI> to &s;top?</P>
<P>Your brother acknowleges, that Mr. Solmes is not near &s;o agreeable in per&s;on, as Mr. Lovelace. But what is <HI>per&s;on,</HI> with &s;uch a lady as I have the honour to be now writing to?&mdash;He owns likewi&s;e, that he has not the addre&s;s of Mr. Lovelace: But what a <HI>mere</HI> per&s;onal advantage is <HI>addre&s;s,</HI> without <HI>morals?</HI>&mdash;A lady had better take a hu&s;band who&s;e manners &s;he were to fa&s;hion, than to find them ready-fa&s;hion'd
<PB N="360" REF="361">
to her hand, at the price of his morality; a price that is often paid for travelling accompli&s;hments. O my dear cou&s;in, were you but with us here at Florence, or at Rome, or at Paris (where al&s;o I re&s;ided for ma|ny months), to &s;ee the gentlemen, who&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>rough</HI> Engli&s;h manners at &s;etting out are to be poli&s;h'd, and what their improvements are in their return thro' the &s;ame places, you would infinitely prefer the man in his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tage, to the &s;ame man in his <HI>la&s;t.</HI> You <HI>find</HI> the difference on their return: Foreign fa&s;hions, foreign vices, and foreign di&s;ea&s;es too, often complete the man, and to de&s;pi&s;e his own country and coun|trymen, him&s;elf &s;till more de&s;picable, than the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> de&s;picable of tho&s;e he de&s;pi&s;es: The&s;e too generally make up, with a mixture of an unblu&s;hing effrontery, the travelled gentleman!</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, I know, de&s;erves to have an ex|ception made in his favour; for he is really a man of parts and learning: He was e&s;teemed &s;o both here and at Rome; and a fine per&s;on, and a generous turn of mind, gave him great advantages. But you need not be told, that a libertine man of &s;en&s;e does infi|nitely more mi&s;chief, than a libertine of weak parts is able to do. And this I will tell you farther, that it was Mr. Lovelace's own fault that he was not &s;till more re&s;pected than he was, among the <HI>Literati</HI> here. There were, in &s;hort, &s;ome liberties, in which he in|dulged him&s;elf, that endangered his per&s;on and his liberty; and made the be&s;t and mo&s;t worthy of tho&s;e who honour'd him with their notice, give him up; and his &s;tay both at Florence and at Rome &s;horter than he de&s;igned.</P>
<P>This is all I choo&s;e to &s;ay of Mr. Lovelace. I had much rather have had rea&s;on to give him a quite con|trary character. But as to rakes or libertines in gene|ral, I, who know them well, mu&s;t be allowed, becau&s;e of the mi&s;chiefs they have always in their hearts, and
<PB N="361" REF="362">
too often in their power, to do your Sex, to add &s;till a few more words upon this topic.</P>
<P>A Libertine, my dear cou&s;in, a plotting, an in|triguing Libertine, mu&s;t be generally remor&s;ele&s;s;&mdash;<HI>Unju&s;t</HI> he mu&s;t always be. The noble rule, of doing to others what he would have done to him&s;elf, is the fir&s;t rule he breaks; and every day he breaks it; the oftener, the greater his triumph. He has great contempt for your &s;ex: He believes no woman cha&s;te, becau&s;e he is a profligate: Every woman who fa|vours him, confirms him in his wicked incredulity. He is always plotting to extend the mi&s;chiefs he de|lights in. If a woman loves &s;uch a man, how can &s;he bear the thought of dividing her intere&s;t in his affections, with half the town, and that, perhaps, the dregs of it?&mdash;Then &s;o &s;en&s;ual!&mdash;How will a young lady of your delicacy bear with &s;o &s;en&s;ual a man? a man who makes a je&s;t of his vows; and who, perhaps, will break your &s;pirit by the mo&s;t unmanly in&s;ults. To <HI>be</HI> a libertine, at &s;etting out, all compunction, all huma|nity, mu&s;t be overcome. To <HI>continue</HI> to be a liber|tine, is to continue to be every thing vile and inhu|man. Prayers, tears, and the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, are but fuel to his pride: Wagering perhaps with lewd companions, and, not improbably, with lewder women, upon in&s;tances which he boa&s;ts of to them of your patient &s;ufferings and broken &s;pirit, and bringing them home to witne&s;s to both. I write what I know <HI>has</HI> been.</P>
<P>I mention not fortunes &s;quander'd, e&s;tates mortgaged or &s;old, and po&s;terity robb'd: Nor yet a multitude of other evils, too gro&s;s, too &s;hocking, to be men|tioned to a delicacy like yours.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, my dear cou&s;in, to be &s;hunn'd, all the evils I have named to be avoided; the power of doing all the good you have been accu&s;tomed to do, pre|&s;erved, nay, increa&s;ed, by the &s;eparate provi&s;ion that will be made for you: Your charming diver&s;ions, and
<PB N="362" REF="363">
exemplary employments all maintained; and every good habit perpetuated: And all by <HI>one</HI> &s;acrifice, the fading plea&s;ure of the eye: Who would not (&s;ince every thing is not to be met with in one man; who would not) to pre&s;erve &s;o many e&s;&s;entials, give up &s;o light, &s;o unpermanent a plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Weigh all the&s;e things, which I might in&s;i&s;t upon to more advantage, did I think it needful to one of your prudence: Weigh them well, my beloved cou&s;in; and if it be not the will of your parents that you &s;hould continue &s;ingle, re&s;olve to oblige them; and let it not be &s;aid, that the powers of fancy &s;hall (as in many others of your &s;ex) be too hard for your duty and your prudence. The le&s;s agreeable the man, the more obliging the compliance: Remember, that he is a &s;o|ber man: A man who has reputation to lo&s;e, and who&s;e reputation therefore is a &s;ecurity for his good behaviour to you.</P>
<P>You have an opportunity offer'd you, to give the highe&s;t in&s;tance that can be given, of filial duty:&mdash;Embrace it; it is worthy <HI>of</HI> you; it is expected <HI>from</HI> you; however, for your inclination &s;ake, one may be &s;orry that you are called upon to give it. Let it be &s;aid, that you have been able to lay an obligation up|on your parents (A proud word, my cou&s;in!) which you could not do, were it not laid <HI>again&s;t</HI> your incli|nation!&mdash;Upon parents, who have laid a thou&s;and up|on you: Who are &s;et upon this point: Who will not give it up: Who have given up many points to you, even of this very nature: And in <HI>their</HI> turn, for the &s;ake of their own authority, as well as judgment, ex|pect to be obliged.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall &s;oon, in per&s;on, congratulate you upon This your meritorious compliance. To &s;ettle and give up my tru&s;tee&s;hip, is one of the principal mo|tives of my leaving the&s;e parts. I &s;hall be glad to &s;ettle it, to every one's &s;atisfaction; to Yours particularly. If on my arrival I find a happy union, as formerly,
<PB N="363" REF="364">
reign in a family &s;o dear to me, it will be an un&s;peak|able plea&s;ure to me; and I &s;hall perhaps &s;o di&s;po&s;e my affairs, as to be near you for ever.</P>
<P>I have written a very long letter, and will add no more, than that I am, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, my deare&s;t cou&s;in,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t affectionate and faithful &s;ervant, WM. MORDEN.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, that you have read my cou&s;in's letter. It is now in vain to wi&s;h it had come &s;ooner. But if it had, I might perhaps have been &s;o ra&s;h as to give Mr. Lovelace the fatal meeting, as I little thought of going off with him.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould hardly have given him the <HI>expectation</HI> of &s;o doing, <HI>previous</HI> to the meeting, which made him come prepared; and the revocation of which he &s;o artfully made ineffectual.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecuted as I was, and little expecting &s;o much conde&s;cen&s;ion, as my aunt, to my great mortification, has told me (and you confirm) that I &s;hould have met with, it is, however, hard to &s;ay, what I &s;hould or &s;hould not have done, as to meeting him, had it come in time: But this effect I verily believe it would have had,&mdash;To have made me in&s;i&s;t with all my might, on going over, out of all their ways, to the kind writer of the in&s;tructive letter, and made a fa|ther, a protector, as well as a friend, of a cou&s;in, who is one of my tru&s;tees. This, circum&s;tanced as I was, would have been a natural, at lea&s;t an unexception|able protection.&mdash;But I was to be unhappy! And how it cuts me to the heart to think, that I can already &s;ub&s;cribe to my cou&s;in's character of a libertine, &s;o well drawn in the letter which I &s;uppo&s;e you now to have read!</P>
<P>That &s;uch a vile character, which ever was my abhorrence, &s;hould fall to my lot!&mdash;But depending on my own &s;trength; having no rea&s;on to apprehend
<PB N="364" REF="365">
danger from head&s;trong and di&s;graceful impul&s;es, I too little, perhaps, ca&s;t up my eyes to the Supreme Director: In whom, mi&s;tru&s;ting my&s;elf, I ought to have placed my whole confidence!&mdash;And the more, when I &s;aw my&s;elf &s;o per&s;i&s;tingly addre&s;&s;ed by a man of this character.</P>
<P>Inexperience and pre&s;umption, with the help of a brother and &s;i&s;ter, who have low ends to an&s;wer in my di&s;grace, have been my <HI>ruin!</HI>&mdash;A hard word, my dear! But I repeat it upon deliberation: Since, let the be&s;t happen, which <HI>now</HI> can happen, my reputa|tion is de&s;troyed; a Rake is my portion: And what That portion is, my cou&s;in Morden's letter has ac|quainted you.</P>
<P>Pray keep it by you, till called for. I &s;aw it not my&s;elf (having not the heart to in&s;pect my trunks) till this morning. I would not for the world This man &s;hould &s;ee it; becau&s;e it might occa&s;ion mi&s;chief between the mo&s;t violent &s;pirit, and the mo&s;t &s;ettled brave one, in the world, as my cou&s;in's is &s;aid to be.</P>
<P>This letter was inclo&s;ed (opened) in a blank cover. Scorn and dete&s;t me as they will, I wonder that one line was not &s;ent with it&mdash;were it but to have more particularly pointed the de&s;ign of it, in the &s;ame ge|nerous &s;pirit, that &s;ent me the Spira.&mdash;The &s;ealing of the cover was with black wax. I hope there is no new occa&s;ion in the family to give rea&s;on for black wax. But if there were, it would, to be &s;ure, have been mention'd, and laid at my door&mdash;perhaps too ju&s;tly!</P>
<P>I had begun a letter to my cou&s;in; but laid it by, becau&s;e of the uncertainty of my &s;ituation, and expect|ing every-day, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, to be at a greater certainty. You bid me write to him, &s;ome time ago, you know. Then it was I began it: For I have great plea&s;ure in obeying you in all I may. So I ought to have; for you are the only friend left me: And more|over, you generally honour me with your own ob|&s;ervance
<PB N="365" REF="366">
of the advice I take the liberty to offer you: For I pretend to &s;ay, I give better advice than I have taken. And &s;o I had need. For, I know not how it comes about, but I am, in my own opinion, a poor lo&s;t creature: And yet cannot charge my&s;elf with one criminal or faulty inclination. Do you know, my dear, how This can be?</P>
<P>Yet I can tell you <HI>how,</HI> I believe:&mdash;One devious &s;tep at &s;etting out!&mdash;That mu&s;t be It:&mdash;Which pur&s;ued, has led me &s;o far out of my path, that I am in a wil|derne&s;s of doubt and error; and never, never, &s;hall find my way out of it: For, altho' but one pace awry at fir&s;t, it has led me hundreds and hundreds of miles out of my path: And the poor e&s;tray has not one kind friend, nor has met with one directing pa&s;|&s;enger, to help her to recover it.</P>
<P>But I, pre&s;umptuous creature! mu&s;t rely &s;o much upon my own knowlege of the right path!&mdash;little ap|prehending that an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> with its fal&s;e fires (and yet I had heard enough of &s;uch) would ari&s;e to mi&s;|lead me!&mdash;And now, in the mid&s;t of fens and quag|mires, it plays around me, and around me, throwing me back again, whenever I think my&s;elf in the right track.&mdash;But there is one common point, in which all &s;hall meet, err widely as they may. In That I &s;hall be laid quietly down at la&s;t: And then will all my ca|lamities be at an end.</P>
<P>But how I &s;tray again; &s;tray from my intention! I would only have &s;aid, that I had begun a letter to my cou&s;in Morden &s;ome time ago: But that, now, I can never end it. You will believe I cannot: For how &s;hall I tell him, that all his compliments are mi&s;|be&s;towed: That all his advice is thrown away: All his warnings vain: And that even my highe&s;t expecta|tion is to be the wife of that free liver, whom he &s;o pathetically warns me to &s;hun?</P>
<P>Let me, however, have your prayers joined with my own, (my fate depending, as it &s;eems, upon the
<PB N="366" REF="367">
lips of &s;uch a man),
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, whatever &s;hall be my de|&s;tiny, That dreadful part of my father's malediction, That I may be puni&s;hed by the man in whom he &s;uppo&s;es I put my confidence, may not take place! That This for <HI>Mr. Lovelace's</HI> own &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of <HI>human nature,</HI> may not be!&mdash;Or, if it be nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;upport of the parental authority, that I &s;hould be puni&s;hed by <HI>him,</HI> that it may not be by his <HI>premeditated</HI> or <HI>wilful</HI> ba&s;ene&s;s; but that I may be able to acquit his <HI>intention,</HI> if not his <HI>action!</HI>'</Q>
Otherwi&s;e, my fault will appear to be doubled in the eye of the event judging world. And yet, methinks, I would be glad, that the unkindne&s;s of my father and uncles, who&s;e hearts have already been too much wounded by my error, may be ju&s;tify'd in every ar|ticle, excepting in this heavy cur&s;e: And that my father will be plea&s;ed to withdraw That, before it be generally known, at lea&s;t that mo&s;t dreadful part of it, which regards futurity!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t lay down my pen: I mu&s;t brood over the&s;e reflections: Once more, before I inclo&s;e my cou&s;in's letter, I will peru&s;e it: And then I &s;hall have it by heart.</P>
