<P>THE moment I had laid down my pen, Harriet flew into my room, to expre&s;s her &s;urpri&s;e at Lord Lucan's arrival; but joy was much more predomi|nant than wonder, in her artle&s;s eyes&mdash;Lu|cy came into my chamber, &s;oon after, to a&s;&s;ure me that &s;he did not know of his Lord&s;hip's coming, or even that he was an acquaintance of Sir Harry's, till he in|troduced him to her, that in&s;tant, below &s;tairs. Harriet replied, with unu&s;ual
<PB N="2" REF="4">
vivacity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Surely, Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter, you need not make an apology for &s;uch an agreeable addition to our &s;ociety, as Lord Lucan?"</Q> The moment the&s;e words had e&s;caped her, her face was co|vered with blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>I took not the lea&s;t notice of her emo|tion, though it &s;truck me &s;trongly, when contra&s;ted with the different &s;en&s;ations of fear and anxiety that affected my heart. A thou&s;and di&s;agreeable thoughts ru&s;hed at once into my mind; I determined, however, to act with the utmo&s;t circum|&s;pection, and carefully to avoid any par|ticular interview or conver&s;ation with his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>I did not quit my chamber till dinner was &s;erved;&mdash;I &s;pent the intermediate
<PB N="3" REF="5">
hour extremely ill, in forming &s;et &s;peeches, and fa&s;hioning my conduct to impo&s;|&s;ible rules, which all vani&s;hed out of my thoughts, like a dream, the moment I beheld Lord Lucan; and I &s;uppo&s;e that no creature could ever have appeared more completely embarra&s;&s;ed upon any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>His countenance, upon &s;eeing me, was expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;incere&s;t delight; there was a brilliancy in his eye, and a liveli|ne&s;s in his complexion, which would have made the homelie&s;t features plea&s;|ing&mdash;Alas! his wanted not this adventi|tious aid.&mdash;</P>
<P>My confu&s;ion &s;oon became contagious, and &s;eemed to throw a general damp up|on the &s;pirits of the whole company&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Even the happy Cre&s;wel abated of his chearfulne&s;s, and often &s;ent forth a look of inquiry, to try if he could di&s;cover the cau&s;e of his own change, in Lucy's now altered countenance.</P>
<P>I could not help perceiving the gloom I had &s;pread, and endeavoured, but in vain, to rally my &s;pirits:&mdash;they were &s;unk too low to be recalled.&mdash;I would have retired, but that would have been an ad|dition to my friend's di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;We made a dull and &s;ilent meal, and I quitted the table the moment it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I withdrew immediately to my cham|ber, and begged to be left alone&mdash;I was indulged by Lucy, though unwillingly. I tried to account to my&s;elf for the un|common heavine&s;s which oppre&s;&s;ed my
<PB N="5" REF="7">
heart.&mdash;The weakne&s;s of my pa&s;t con|duct appeared in the mo&s;t glaring light to me; and, from the agonies of remor&s;e which I then felt, I concluded my&s;elf the mo&s;t guilty of wretches.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet my rea&s;on revolted again&s;t this opinion, but was &s;till utterly unable to bani&s;h it, or to account for the &s;udden change in my &s;entiments upon this &s;ub|ject, as no alteration had happened, ei|ther in Lord Lucan's conduct, or my &s;i|tuation, from the time that I had con&s;i|dered my attachment to him as perfectly innocent, becau&s;e it was ab&s;olutely invo|luntary&mdash;I became almo&s;t di&s;tracted with my doubts; and, traver&s;ing my chamber with ha&s;ty &s;teps, I exclaimed, how poor, how in&s;ufficient is human rea&s;on, either
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to direct our actions, or re&s;train our pa&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>O Thou, that &s;tille&s;t the raging of the &s;ea! and calme&s;t the fury of the winds! abate this conflict in thy creature's brea&s;t! and point the way in which my feet &s;hould tread to find the paths of peace!&mdash;A &s;udden gu&s;h of tears followed this ejaculation, my mind grew calm, and I thought I could at that in&s;tant have ta|ken an everla&s;ting leave of Lord Lucan, with the mo&s;t perfect re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>I continued mu&s;ing upon the &s;ubject of my future conduct, for a long time; and at la&s;t determined, that I would endea|vour to a&s;&s;ume as much chearfulne&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, while I remained at Elm-grove; that, in a very few days after the wedd|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
I would return to Southfield, but, before I went, write a letter to Lord Lu|can, fully expre&s;&s;ive of the change in my &s;entiments with regard to him, or rather my&s;elf, enjoining him to make no reply, nor attempt ever to &s;ee me more.</P>
<P>Soon after I had formed this re&s;olu|tion, Lucy tapped &s;oftly at my chamber-door.&mdash;She &s;aw I had been weeping, but as I &s;miled, and held out my hand on her approach, &s;he &s;aid my face might be compared to an April day, but as &s;un&s;hine &s;eemed now to prevail &s;he hoped there would be no more &s;howers&mdash;we joined the company, and I with plea&s;ure per|ceived that I was much le&s;s con&s;trained in my manner to Lord Lucan, and every body el&s;e, than I had been at dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">A little flight of Sir Harry's, at the time that the gentlemen were to leave us, and return to town, threw me into a &s;econd embarra&s;&s;ment&mdash;he in&s;i&s;ted upon his being permitted to &s;alute all the la|dies, as he &s;hould never be another night a bachelor; and that Lord Lucan, and a young gentleman, who&s;e name is We&s;|ton, and was then pre&s;ent, &s;hould &s;alute Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter, as &s;he &s;hould not chu&s;e to &s;pare them one of her ki&s;&s;es, when he &s;hould have an exclu&s;ive right to the &s;ole property of them.</P>
<P>Young We&s;ton, who, perhaps, mi&s;|takes vivacity for good breeding, pro|po&s;ed this folly's becoming general, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to object &s;eriou&s;ly to a matter that appeared &s;o very trifling; e&s;pecially upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&mdash;Once at a wedding, you know, is a proverb.</P>
<P>Yet neither you, nor any of that com|pany, will, I hope, ever know the pangs I felt at receiving a ki&s;s from Lord Lu|can.&mdash;It &s;eemed to co&s;t him almo&s;t as much pain as it did me, for he trembl|ed as if he had been &s;eized with an ague-fit.&mdash;The con&s;ent of my heart &s;hocked me with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt.&mdash;I am &s;orry the fooli&s;h affair hap|pened&mdash;but I will think no more of it.</P>
<P>It is now near two o' clock in the morning of Lucy's wedding-day; and as I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall not have much lei&s;ure, for &s;ome time to come, I would not omit, before I lay me down to re&s;t, if that may be, acquainting my dear con|fe&s;&s;or
<PB N="10" REF="12">
and coun&s;ellor with the &s;tate of that heart, which, while it beats, will ever re|tain the tendere&s;t affection for her.</P>
<P>Every good wi&s;h attends my brother; and I hope I may by this time add, his amiable wife.&mdash;My Fanny's claim to that title, is, I think and hope, not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>The renewal of Lord Hume's connec|tions with Sir George might have been merely accidental; but his continuing them in the manner he has done, even to the incumbrance of my brother, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;peaks the revival of his attachment to you much &s;trong|er than the mo&s;t direct and formal propo|&s;ition could po&s;&s;ibly have done.&mdash;His at|torney might perform the one, but his
<PB N="11" REF="13">
pa&s;&s;ion only could be capable of the other.</P>
<P>Lord Hume has his merits as well as his faults; and the mild eye of my &s;i&s;ter's charity is ever more open to the former than the latter; and, if the union I have hinted at &s;hould take place, I tru&s;t they will become every day more con&s;picuous.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu, my Fanny. <SIGNED>L. BARTON.</SIGNED>

<P>P.S. Eight o' clock in the morn|ing.&mdash;I have pa&s;&s;ed a mi&s;erable night&mdash;di&s;turbed &s;lumbers, and terrifying dreams&mdash;If I were &s;uper&s;titious, I &s;hould ima|gine &s;ome ill fate awaits me&mdash;Alas! how totally unfit am I for the fe&s;tivity of a bridal day!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>OUR wedding, my Fanny, was conducted with the greate&s;t pro|priety and elegance; there were eighteen per&s;ons pre&s;ent, the elde&s;t of whom, Mrs. Layton excepted, was not eight and twen|ty.&mdash;Plea&s;ure &s;at &s;miling on every placid brow; even I endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume an air of chearfulne&s;s, but thought my&s;elf, like Lucifer in heaven, unble&s;&s;ed amid&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that every woman looks bet|ter on her wedding-day, than any other of her life.&mdash;I confe&s;s I never &s;aw Lady Cre&s;wel appear &s;o beautiful; there was a &s;ort of &s;erene happine&s;s in her counte|nance,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
which I know not how to de|&s;cribe; her clear brown complexion ap|peared almo&s;t tran&s;parent, yet was often heightened to the mo&s;t becoming blu&s;h, by the fond looks of her enamoured bridegroom.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of all brides is nearly the &s;ame;&mdash;you may therefore conclude, that Lady Cre&s;wel wore white and &s;il|ver.&mdash;The bride-maids were dre&s;&s;ed ex|actly alike, <HI>par hazard,</HI> in pale pink and &s;ilver.&mdash;My cloaths were&mdash;Gracious heaven! how can I write about &s;uch trifling matters, while my heart is break|ing?&mdash;I mu&s;t fly, my Fanny! for ever fly from the &s;ight of one, who becomes every hour more dangerous to my re|po&s;e!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">We have now been three days toge|ther under the &s;ame roof, yet have I been lucky enough to avoid any particu|lar conver&s;ation with Lord Lucan.&mdash;He perceives my caution; his vanity is doubtle&s;s flattered by it, yet he affects to appear unhappy; his looks are ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the tendere&s;t &s;orrow, and he &s;ometimes gazes on me till he &s;eems to have lo&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Poor Harriet watches his eyes&mdash;alas! they are but &s;eldom turned on her! If he is really as wretched as he &s;eems, he is to the full as much to be pitied as my|&s;elf.&mdash;Why did we ever meet? or, why not &s;ooner? That heart which, in &s;pite of the re&s;traint of duty, is but too much devoted to him now, had it been free, my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I fear 'tis criminal to in|dulge
<PB N="15" REF="17">
this fond idea&mdash;I will &s;uppre&s;s it then.</P>
<P>I have not had lei&s;ure to begin the let|ter I intend to write to him; but to mor|row, or the next day&mdash;in &s;hort, before I &s;eal this, I will.&mdash;And yet, what can I &s;ay to him?&mdash;Have I ought to complain of in his conduct, that can warrant an ever|la&s;ting breach between us?&mdash;Has he not kept within the bounds pre&s;cribed by me? Has he even pre&s;umed to hint he thinks them too &s;evere? Unle&s;s involuntary &s;ighs and tender looks are con&s;trued in|to crimes, Lucan has not offended!&mdash;Yet, yet I will break off this&mdash;I know not what to call it&mdash;improper, at lea&s;t, as well as painful connection!&mdash;I am al|mo&s;t di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>I have this moment received a letter from Lord Lucan.&mdash;I am glad of it.&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="18">
This is encroaching.&mdash;I have now &s;ome pretence for my intended breach.&mdash;Yet read it, Fanny.&mdash;I will copy it, if my fa&s;t-&s;treaming tears don't wa&s;h the lines away.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Lady BARTON.</HEAD>
<P>IF, as I hoped, the mo&s;t profound &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to her will, whom my mind wor&s;hips, and my eyes adore, could have pre&s;erved me her e&s;teem, never had the unhappy Lucan infringed Lady Barton's command, nor even dared to repine at being forbidden to expre&s;s his hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, by &s;peech or letter to her.</P>
<P>But, alas! Madam, though love is blind, lovers are quick &s;ighted; and I but too clearly perceive, that I have lo&s;t that
<PB N="17" REF="19">
portion of your regard, with which I had, perhaps, too vainly flattered my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mean not, Madam, to reproach you with this cruel change, but humbly to implore you to inform me, if I have&mdash;tho' unwittingly, heaven knows!&mdash;been &s;o unfortunate as to have offended you, even in the &s;lighte&s;t article of my con|duct.</P>
<P>If my appearing before you, at this time, without permi&s;&s;ion, be imputed to me, give me leave to transfer the blame upon chance, which led me hi|ther, without knowing that you had in|tended to have honoured Lady Cre&s;wel's wedding with your pre&s;ence. The tran&s;|ports I was &s;en&s;ible of, on meeting you &s;o unexpectedly here, cannot &s;urely be
<PB N="18" REF="20">
deemed a crime; and yet the mi&s;ery I have &s;ince &s;u&s;tained, has made me al|ready &s;ufficiently atone for it, as if it had been one.</P>
<P>Even my pre&s;ent pre&s;umption bears its own apology along with it, as your cru|elty and my ju&s;tification required it. The unhappy, but unoffending &s;uppliant, may expo&s;tulate even with Heaven it&s;elf, with|out impiety.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s no farther on you, Ma|dam, than ju&s;t to a&s;&s;ure you, that I find I belong no longer to my&s;elf, and that, in &s;pite both of you and me,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, and &s;hall remain, ever yours, LUCAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">What &s;hall I &s;ay to him, my &s;i&s;|ter? What an&s;wer &s;hall I make to lines &s;o full of tenderne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Can I be unju&s;t enough to reproach or condemn him, while he is guiltle&s;s of any offence towards me? Yet, if I acquit him, do I not criminate my&s;elf? Mu&s;t he not think me unworthy of his regards, if female caprice alone &s;hould appear the motive of my altered conduct?&mdash;I will not enter on the &s;ubject, but coldly tell him, that I fir&s;t repented, then con|quered my pa&s;t weakne&s;s, and bid him try to follow my example.&mdash;O, Fanny! I &s;hall break his gentle heart! If but my own would bur&s;t, I &s;hould be happy!</P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent is this letter with my la&s;t!&mdash;Why can I not again recover that
<PB N="20" REF="22">
calmne&s;s, which even a tran&s;ient devotion had in&s;pired?&mdash;Alas! becau&s;e my piety was but temporary, and tran&s;itory!&mdash;Like the ungrateful I&s;raelites, <HI>I &s;ought the Lord in my trouble.</HI>&mdash;But has he not pro|mi&s;ed <HI>to be nigh to all tho&s;e who call upon him?</HI>&mdash;His mercy is not limited, and in that hope will I confide.</P>
<P>More than half the night is elap&s;ed; but I will not clo&s;e my eyes till I have written to Lord Lucan.&mdash;Should I defer it till to-morrow, his &s;upplicating eye and te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">der looks may change my unfirm purpo&s;e.&mdash;Would to heaven I had not come here!&mdash;Never was any creature &s;o altered in the time.&mdash;Sir William will certainly perceive the change; and how &s;hall I account for it?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">It is done, my &s;i&s;ter! I have taken an everla&s;ting leave of Lord Lucan!&mdash;I will copy what I have written&mdash;How infinite|ly &s;hort does it fall of what I wi&s;hed to &s;ay!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERFECTLY &s;en&s;ible, as I am, of the faultine&s;s of my conduct, both to|wards you and my&s;elf, I &s;ubmit, without repining, to the cen&s;ure implied in your letter&mdash;But, alas! my Lord, the crime I am there charged with, is not the &s;ource of my &s;elf-condemnation.&mdash;That you may be perfectly convinced of my &s;inceri|ty, I will confe&s;s that I &s;aw your grow|ing pa&s;&s;ion, from its earlie&s;t infancy, and, at the &s;ame time, beheld you in the mo&s;t favourable light;&mdash;yet I vainly

hoped, that, &s;ituated as I then was, my virtue would have been proof, even again&s;t your merit, and my &s;en&s;e of it;&mdash;and that the knowing my heart ought to be devoted to another, was &s;ufficient to render it &s;o.&mdash;How have I &s;ince blu&s;hed at that pre&s;umption, which was founded, not in &s;trength, but weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>From the moment that the accidental circum&s;tance of the picture, at South|field, had brought on a confe&s;&s;ion of our mutual &s;entiments, peace has been a &s;tranger to my brea&s;t! a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the irrevocable injury I had been guilty of, towards a per&s;on I dare not even name, at pre&s;ent, has haunted me ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">The con&s;tant perturbation of my mind, with other mortifications ari&s;ing from the &s;ame &s;ource, brought on a dan|gerous illne&s;s, which led me a willing victim almo&s;t to the grave. I now rejoice that what I then mo&s;t ardently de|&s;ired, was not the con&s;equence of the joint di&s;order, both of heart, and mind, and body.</P>
<P>Yes, my Lord, I wi&s;h to live, that my future conduct may atone for my pa&s;t folly; and that the example of the weake&s;t of the weaker &s;ex, may enable you to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, which, if in|dulged, mu&s;t be productive of mi&s;ery only, both to your&s;elf, and its unhappy object.</P>
<P>I will not boa&s;t, my Lord, that I have already accompli&s;hed this arduous ta&s;k.
<PB N="24" REF="26">
&mdash;My nature is &s;incere;&mdash;but, as a proof, that I mean &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;ucceed in the at|tempt, I, from this moment, interdict my|&s;elf from ever corre&s;ponding or conver&s;ing with your Lord&s;hip more; and do here de|clare, that I will never pardon your at|tempting either to &s;ee, or write to me, on any future occa&s;ion of our lives.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ever retain the &s;incere&s;t wi&s;hes for your Lord&s;hip's happine&s;s, though this is the la&s;t time that I &s;hall ever &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>I will not comment on this hateful letter: &s;urely I never wrote &s;o bad a one!&mdash;But is that wonderful?&mdash;Is not

the heart, our be&s;t in&s;pirer?&mdash;And can I &s;ay that mine dictated this &s;evere decree?&mdash;Yet I tru&s;t my dear Fanny will ap|prove it.&mdash;It has afforded my mind too a temporary relief.</P>
<P>I mean to order my coach as &s;oon as I ri&s;e in the morning, to &s;end this letter to Lord Lucan, before I appear at break|fa&s;t, and &s;et out directly after for South|field, without giving him time to recover enough from his &s;urprize, &s;o as to at|tempt an expo&s;tulation.</P>

words to expre&s;s the terror I felt, when I was awaked, about four o' clock in the morning, by people &s;creaming out fire, and beating at my door, in order to force it open.&mdash;I found my&s;elf involved in &s;o thick a &s;moke, that I could not find the pa&s;&s;age out of my chamber, and con|cluded that I mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the variety of voices that re|peatedly called upon me to pull up the bolt, I thought I di&s;tingui&s;hed Lord Hume's&mdash;Perhaps this circum&s;tance ad|ded to my confu&s;ion.&mdash;On a &s;udden the voice cea&s;ed, and I found my&s;elf, as it were, left alone in the mid&s;t of the flames, which then bur&s;t into one &s;ide of the room.</P>
<P>At that moment a ladder was fixed again&s;t one of my windows, and Lord
<PB N="30" REF="32">
Hume entering by it, caught me in his arms, and carried me I know not how, but totally devoid of &s;en&s;e, to his apart|ment on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet.</P>
<P>When I had recovered my rea&s;on, I had the happine&s;s of finding my brother and Delia &s;itting by me, and my cham|pion kneeling before me, and pouring lavender water on my hands and face, with a look of &s;uch tender &s;olicitude, as if his life depended upon mine.</P>
<P>The emotion of my gratitude, or call it what you plea&s;e, was too &s;trong for my &s;pirits&mdash;I fainted a &s;econd time.&mdash;I was put to bed in this &s;ituation, and a &s;ur|geon had opened a vein in my arm, be|fore I opened my eyes again.</P>
<P>Never can I forget the expre&s;&s;ive look of &s;orrow which appeared in Lord
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Hume's countenance!&mdash;I confe&s;s it, Loui&s;a, it in one moment obliterated all his pa&s;t offences, and he became even dearer to my heart than he had ever been before.&mdash;His &s;aving my life, even at the hazard of his own, was only a proof of his &s;pirit and humanity, which he ought to have exerted for any other woman, in the &s;ame dreadful &s;ituation:&mdash;But the tender anxiety he &s;hewed towards me af|terwards, &s;poke the fond lover; and the delicacy of his behaviour from that event, has &s;trengthened his claim to that title.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my arm was bound up, I tried to expre&s;s my gratitude to Lord Hume, but could not&mdash;Tears &s;topped my utterance, but relieved the oppre&s;|&s;ion of my heart.&mdash;He &s;eemed as little able him&s;elf to &s;peak as I, but, in an in|coherent

manner, &s;aid, he was the hap|pie&s;t man alive, and ki&s;&s;ed my hand in tran&s;port.&mdash;Sir George then made every per&s;on withdraw, except my maid, and left me for &s;ome hours to compo&s;e my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I found, upon enquiry, that the fire which had con&s;umed three hou&s;es, began at a &s;ugar baker's, who lived next door to us, and that it was not di&s;covered till a part of our hou&s;e was in flames.&mdash;An old &s;ervant of Lord Hume's was the fir&s;t per&s;on who &s;aw the blaze;&mdash;The poor man happened not to be well, and could not &s;leep:&mdash;To his &s;ickne&s;s, under Pro|vidence, are we indebted for our lives, and he &s;hall never more feel the fatigue of &s;ervitude or labour, his lord and my brother having rendered him inde|pendent for life.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">This accident, you may &s;uppo&s;e, re|tarded our &s;etting out.&mdash;Delia, who &s;uf|fered le&s;s than I from the fright, was an equal lo&s;er by the fire.&mdash;In &s;hort, neither we nor our &s;ervants had been able to &s;ave any of our cloaths from the flames.&mdash;You may conclude, that the dear good Wal|ter &s;upplied us with every nece&s;&s;ary till we could get them made.</P>
<P>I fear the apprehen&s;ion &s;he felt on our account, before &s;he knew that we were &s;afe, has hurt her much.&mdash;She looked &s;o very delicate when we parted, that I &s;carce dare flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of ever &s;eeing her more.</P>
<P>While we were delayed at St. Omer's, a &s;econd courier arrived from Mrs. Col|ville, with a letter to St. George, ack|nowledging
<PB N="34" REF="36">
her pa&s;&s;ion for him, plead|ing that in her excu&s;e, and imploring him in the mo&s;t abject terms, not to ex|po&s;e her weakne&s;s, by carrying on the &s;uit again&s;t her; and a&s;&s;uring him of her full con&s;ent to his marriage with her daughter.</P>
<P>In order to avoid being brought to England by the chancellor's me&s;&s;enger, &s;he has retired privately from Toulou&s;e, and has placed her&s;elf in a convent, but where we know not, nor &s;hall ever en|quire.&mdash;I hope &s;he will remain, wherever &s;he is, for life, as I really believe, that the bare &s;ight of her would &s;hock our poor Delia more than the fire had done.</P>
<P>She has &s;ent back the &s;mall trunk which belonged to the per&s;on who died
<PB N="35" REF="37">
at Amiens, and has de&s;ired that Sir George may open it, in order to forward the papers in it, to the party for whom they are de&s;igned; if this can be di&s;co|vered from the initials, which is the only addre&s;s they have.&mdash;My brother has a&s;|&s;igned this commi&s;&s;ion to me, and as &s;oon as I have a moment's lei&s;ure, I will exe|cute it faithfully.</P>
<P>If I continue to write &s;o circum&s;tanti|ally, there will be no end of this letter; you mu&s;t therefore take leave of St. Omer's, and &s;uffer your&s;elf to be in&s;tant|ly tran&s;ported acro&s;s the water with me, as if you were reading one of Shake&s;peare's plays, and conclude us now &s;afely arrived in London, whence I am now writing to you.</P>
<P>After my brother had waited on the chancellor, and &s;hewn him Mrs. Colville's

<P>As both the parties were very well in|clined to enter into the holy &s;tate of ma|trimony, they readily di&s;pen&s;ed with the parade of a public wedding; and on Sa|turday la&s;t, my brother had the happine&s;s of receiving his well-beloved wife, from the hands of my beloved hu&s;band, that is to be&mdash;For we &s;hall take more &s;tate and form upon us than they have done, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mi&s;s CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE he&s;itated, for &s;ome time, dear Loui&s;a, whether, in your pre&s;ent de|jected &s;tate of mind, I &s;hould venture to communicate to you a &s;tory of much woe, which was contained in the papers of the unhappy young woman who died at Amiens.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47">The diverting of any current mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily abate its force, and whatever can awaken our &s;en&s;ibility for the misfor|tunes of others, mu&s;t, at lea&s;t for the time, render us in&s;en&s;ible to our own.</P>
<P>I believe too, that compari&s;on weighs much in our e&s;timation of good and evil; and though a generous heart, even la|bouring under the &s;evere&s;t calamities, may be incapable of forming a wi&s;h for relief, at the expence of another's hap|pine&s;s, yet I am per&s;uaded, that there is a &s;ort of alleviation to be found, in re|flecting that there are, or rather, that there <HI>have been,</HI> others much more wretched than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon this principle then I &s;hall &s;end you this melancholy &s;tory, which I &s;hould never have been mi&s;tre&s;s of, had
<PB N="46" REF="48">
the papers in which it was contained, though un&s;ealed, been properly addre&s;&s;|ed; but as they were only &s;uper&s;cribed with initials, I was obliged to look in|to the contents, in order to forward them to the per&s;on for whom they were de&s;igned; and I hope my tak|ing a copy of them, for you, and you on|ly, will not be con&s;idered as a breach of tru&s;t, either to the living, or the dead.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my brother and &s;i&s;ter went out of town, which was the fir&s;t moment I had lei&s;ure, I opened the little trunk which Mrs. Colville's la&s;t me&s;&s;enger brought to St. Omer's, and which may properly enough be called the <HI>lachrymal urn,</HI> of the unfortunate Maria; for in it was the tearful narrative of a life of &s;or|rows, depo&s;ited; and though &s;he is now
<PB N="47" REF="49">
removed from a po&s;&s;ibility of feeling them, they &s;till retain the magnetic power of living grief, and mu&s;t attract the &s;igh of pity from every tender, every feeling heart.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> MARIA.</P>
<P>To Mr. EDWARD S&mdash;.</P>
<P>Will the mo&s;t tender and affectionate of brothers, with patience, conde&s;cend to read the &s;ad confe&s;&s;ion of a dying wretch, who owns her&s;elf unworthy of his kindne&s;s,&mdash;Yet, trembling on the verge of life, &s;olicits to obtain his pardon and pity!&mdash;Alas! my Edward, they will never reach me!&mdash;No friendly voice can ever &s;ooth my ear, or &s;peak peace to my perturbed heart! for &s;oon the motion of its pul&s;e &s;hall cea&s;e, and this poor &s;hat|tered frame return to du&s;t.&mdash;Drop then

one fond forgiving tear upon the&s;e pa|ges:&mdash;'Tis all I now can a&s;k, or you, e'er long, can grant.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of my mi&s;conduct and mi&s;|fortunes, perhaps, will reach you, before this letter.&mdash;How does my heart now bleed for that indignant grief your gene|rous mind mu&s;t feel, for a beloved &s;i&s;|ter's infamy!</P>
<P>I do not mean to extenuate my faults;&mdash;Alas! they will not bear extenuation!&mdash;And, con&s;cious as I am of my ap|proach to that tribunal, before which we mu&s;t all e'er long appear, deceit or fal&s;|hood would be as weak as wicked.&mdash;Then hear the faithful &s;tory of my heart, and judge me as one erring mortal &s;hould another.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">In le&s;s than a year after you &s;ailed for Bengal, our dear father died&mdash;What an irreparable lo&s;s was mine!&mdash;I need not tell you that as he was in the church, we were at once deprived of the principal part of his fortune, with his life, and that there did not remain above an hundred pounds a year, being a life annuity, pur|cha&s;ed for my mother with her own por|tion, to &s;upport her and me.</P>
<P>The altered countenances and behavi|our of tho&s;e we had formerly called friends, at Glouce&s;ter, made my mother determine on quitting a place where, from her want of knowing the world, &s;he con|&s;idered her&s;elf as <HI>particularly ill treated.</HI>&mdash;She was then fir&s;t taught, that pro&s;perity is the cement of modern friend&s;hip; and when that fails, the tottering &s;tructure &s;inks into decay.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">She conde&s;cended to con&s;ult me upon our future &s;cheme of life; though, as I was not then fifteen, I was but ill quali|fied for an advi&s;er; however, I had heard that Bath was a cheap place of re&s;idence, for tho&s;e who &s;ettle them|&s;elves as inhabitants there; and as I al&s;o believed it to be an agreeable lively &s;cene, I had often wi&s;hed to go thither, during my father's life; and therefore u&s;ed all my little rhetoric with my mo|ther, to fix us there.</P>
<P>I prevailed; and the fir&s;t year we &s;pent in it, was by many degrees the happie&s;t of my life.&mdash;We lived in a &s;mall hou&s;e, near the Cro&s;s-bath, with the greate&s;t oeconomy.&mdash;My mother did not go much into public, but we met with many for|mer acquaintances, who were &s;o obliging
<PB N="51" REF="53">
to matronize me to the rooms, play|hou&s;e, and walks, as often as it was thought proper to let me appear abroad.</P>
<P>You cannot, my Edward, have forgot|ten my face and per&s;on, and may &s;uppo&s;e that I was not without admirers, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many gay flutterers as abound at Bath.&mdash;There are, I believe, fewer &s;e|rious engagements made there, than at any place where &s;uch a concour&s;e of young people continually meet.&mdash;Whe|ther this is owing to the perpetual di&s;&s;i|pation they live in, or to the con&s;tant ro|tation of new faces that appear there dai|ly, is not to me material.&mdash;My heart, alas! was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of a tender impre&s;&s;ion; and Captain L&mdash;, &s;on to Sir Richard L&mdash;, fir&s;t in&s;pired my art|le&s;s bo&s;om with love.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">During the fir&s;t three months of our acquaintance, we &s;aw each other every day; nor did the idea of parting, or any other painful thought, obtrude upon our minds, to interrupt the plea&s;ing delirium of our mutual fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>Our happine&s;s was then mo&s;t certainly too great to la&s;t.&mdash;A letter from Sir Richard L&mdash; to his &s;on, acquainting him that he was promoted to the rank of Captain, in a regiment which was then &s;ta|tioned in Ireland, with a peremptory command to &s;et out thither immediately, was the fir&s;t, and we then thought the &s;e|vere&s;t &s;hock, that fate could inflict on us.</P>
<P>Though my mother was extremely in|dulgent to me, yet, from a delicacy natu|ral to young minds, I had never ven|tured
<PB N="53" REF="55">
to acquaint her with my attachment to Captain L&mdash;. To this &s;mall, but fatal error, I, perhaps, owe mo&s;t of the &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;eries of my life.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intimate acquaintance I then had, was a young married lady, about three and twenty, who &s;eemed to have the greate&s;t friend&s;hip for my lover, and tenderne&s;s for me, imaginable&mdash;Her name is &mdash;, but I will not expo&s;e her, for the &s;ake of a re&s;pectable family to whom &s;he is allied&mdash;though &s;he has brought infamy and &s;orrows upon me and mine.</P>
<P>I will call her Matilda&mdash;To her then I di&s;clo&s;ed the angui&s;h of my heart, at the &s;ad thought of parting with my lover, and wept upon her bo&s;om&mdash;She &s;eemed
<PB N="54" REF="56">
to con&s;ider my di&s;tre&s;s as trifling:&mdash;Told me I had too much &s;en&s;ibility to be hap|py, and advi&s;ed me to conquer it;&mdash;then added, laughing, the&s;e fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ions are always trouble&s;ome, but you will not be &s;o much affected at parting with your next lover. I was offended and di&s;gu&s;t|ed at her &s;peech&mdash;The very idea had profligacy in it&mdash;She quickly perceived my re&s;entment, and had addre&s;s enough to change her &s;tile, and &s;oothe me into the mo&s;t perfect confidence.</P>
<P>During the &s;hort time that Captain L&mdash; remained at Bath, after his father's &s;ummons, we three were in&s;eparable.&mdash;He would have married me, at that in|terval; but, as he was not of age, being then but ju&s;t turned of twenty, he could get no clergyman to perform the cere|mony
<PB N="55" REF="57">
for us.&mdash;At length the fatal hour of &s;eparation arrived&mdash;Happine&s;s and he were one, in my e&s;timation&mdash;They fled, alas! together.</P>
<P>From his letters I received the &s;ole con&s;olation that could alleviate the pangs of ab&s;ence.&mdash;They were frequent and tender; yet I thought latterly, that I &s;ometimes di&s;covered a little tendency towards jealou&s;y in them; but, uncon|&s;cious as I was of having given the &s;lighte&s;t ground for &s;u&s;picion, by my conduct, I thought it beneath me to en|ter into a particular defence again&s;t a ge|neral charge; and therefore &s;uffered eve|ry hint upon this &s;ubject to pa&s;s unno|ticed.</P>
<P>We had lived now above a year at Bath, and my mother began to find her|&s;elf
<PB N="56" REF="58">
extremely &s;traitened in her circum|&s;tances&mdash;You had it not then in your power, my dear and generous Edward, to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s; and I am certain that one of the &s;evere&s;t, which &s;he her&s;elf felt, was her not being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, in the fir&s;t dawnings of your then infant fortunes.</P>
<P>My mother, though pa&s;t the prime of life, was &s;till hand&s;ome; and, at &s;uch a cri&s;is, dre&s;s is of much more con&s;equence to a woman, than at an earlier aera; &s;he had been u&s;ed to elegance and affluence, yet &s;he chearfully re&s;igned them all, and continued to wear deep mourning, in or|der to ornament me with the remains of her former paraphernalia, and every little addition that &s;he could make to it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">Matilda u&s;ed to take me with her fre|quently to the rooms, and generally in|vited me to private parties, at her own apartments;&mdash;&s;ometimes with my mo|ther, but oftener without.&mdash;She al|ways played high, and &s;eemed &s;olicitous to po&s;&s;e&s;s me with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I re&s;i&s;ted the temptation, for &s;ome time, on account of the danger and indecorum of &s;uch a cour&s;e of life.&mdash;To which &s;he replied, that as cards were now become the <HI>bon ton</HI> of all civilized nations, the latter of my objections was &s;ufficiently obviated; and that, in order to guard again&s;t the former, the earlier I began to practi&s;e, the better.&mdash;For, as I &s;hould &s;oon be a per&s;on of rank and fortune, by the death of Sir Richard L&mdash;, I could not think of living like a hou&s;ewife, in &s;uch an <HI>improved and en|lightened</HI>

<HI>age,</HI> as the pre&s;ent; and that, as high play had now became the gene|ral amu&s;ement and occupation of all people intitled to a&s;&s;ociate in polite life, the &s;ooner I was initiated into the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences</HI> of gaming, the &s;afer it would be for my hu&s;band's fortune, or my own.</P>

<P>I am convinced that there is but one &s;tep ea&s;y to avoid, in vice, and that is the fir&s;t.&mdash;The fear and di&s;gu&s;t with which I

had engaged at play, at the begin|ning, wore off by degrees; and habit had &s;educed my mind into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for cards, in a &s;hort time, that I regret|ted the Sundays that my mother con|fined me at home, after the church &s;ervice was over, to read proper di&s;cour&s;es, and li&s;ten to her mo&s;t excellent in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash;, an elderly gentleman of fortune, u&s;ed generally to be of our par|ties.&mdash;He &s;eemed to di&s;tingui&s;h me, in a particular manner, and u&s;ed to favour me at play; which, as &s;oon as I di&s;cover|ed, I immediately re&s;ented, and declared I would lay down my cards, if he &s;hould ever again attempt to pay me the lea&s;t compliment of the kind, to the di&s;ad|vantage, either of him&s;elf, or any of the re&s;t of the company.&mdash;This pro|per
<PB N="60" REF="62">
reproof of mine obliged him to re|&s;train his too indelicate galantry towards me for the future.</P>
<P>My card-accompt pre&s;erved it&s;elf pret|ty even for &s;ome time, without giving me occa&s;ion to tre&s;pa&s;s on the credit which my friend Matilda had made me &s;o voluntary a proffer of; till one night that I happened to be led in by her, to engage at loo, which was a game I had never played at before, and knew &s;o lit|tle of, as not to be aware how deeply I might be involved, upon a turn of luck again&s;t me.&mdash;The &s;takes were not high, but, as the &s;orfeits were unlimited, I found my&s;elf indebted to Mr. W&mdash;, in the &s;um of thirty guineas, when the party broke up.</P>
<P>I applied to my friend for the money, but &s;he put me off at that time, by &s;ay|ing
<PB N="61" REF="63">
that I &s;hould try my fortune again, the next evening, at her apartments; and that &s;he would then put whatever bal|lance &s;hould appear again&s;t me on a pro|per footing for payment.&mdash;I was tempted to venture on a &s;econd e&s;&s;ay at the &s;ame game, and concluded the night with doubling the debt to the &s;ame per&s;on. I then claimed Matilda's promi&s;e; but &s;he an&s;wered me with great coldne&s;s, and a con&s;trained &s;mile, that my creditor was a gentleman of large fortune, and, as he had made her a confidant of his partiali|ty in my favour, &s;he &s;hould think it a breach of honour to take me out of his hands, by relea&s;ing me from &s;o trifling an obligation as this was.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and alarm I felt upon this occa&s;ion is not to be expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;It was
<PB N="62" REF="64">
too &s;urely a pre&s;age of all my future mi|&s;eries!&mdash;I began to find that I had been mo&s;t treacherou&s;ly dealt by&mdash;I retired to my chamber, without &s;peaking even to my mother, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in walking about di&s;tractedly, and crying out, How &s;hall I be ever able to di&s;charge this dangerous debt! or how render a ju&s;tifiable account of my conduct, either to my mother, to the world, but more e&s;pecially to my dear Captain L&mdash;!</P>
<P>I confined my&s;elf at home for &s;eve|ral days after this adventure, during which time Matilda came often to &s;olicit my returning <HI>into the world</HI> again, and affected to ridicule my prudery, in being rendered &s;o unea|&s;y about &s;o in&s;ignificant a circum|&s;tance, which, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me was

but one of the common events of life. However, I continued re&s;olute in keep|ing my&s;elf retired, and remained incon|&s;olable, on this unhappy incident, till I received a letter from Captain L&mdash;, which I opened with tran&s;port, hoping it would calm my mind, and re&s;tore my peace again.&mdash;Alas! what an aggrava|tion to my misfortune and di&s;tre&s;s, did I meet with there!</P>
<P>He told me that his regiment was or|dered to America, and that he &s;hould embark with it in le&s;s than ten days, which time was elap&s;ed at the moment I received his letter.&mdash;He added, that my conduct had convinced him, that, if he &s;hould never return to England, I would be ea&s;ily con&s;oled for his lo&s;s, though he &s;hould never cea&s;e to regret mine&mdash;Wi&s;h|ed

<P>My mind already di&s;turbed and agi|tated, this cruel letter almo&s;t unhinged my rea&s;on, and &s;unk me into the mo&s;t pitiable &s;tate of dejection.&mdash;My mother, who was ignorant of the real cau&s;e of my di&s;turbance, apprehended &s;ome heavy di&s;order to be falling upon me, and at|tended me night and day, with the fond|e&s;t anxiety imaginable.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time I continued in a &s;tate of the profounde&s;t melancholy;&mdash;at length the voice of nature waked my rea&s;on.&mdash;The tears and &s;ighs of a fond parent, by &s;ympathetic force attracted mine, and called forth all my gratitude&mdash;I &s;trove to
<PB N="65" REF="67">
hide my angui&s;h, even in &s;miles, but it &s;till preyed upon my tortured heart.</P>
<P>The &s;hame of having carried on a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence, with a lover, who had now &s;o plainly ca&s;t me off, pre|vented my revealing to my mother any circum&s;tance of a connection, which I then con&s;idered as di&s;graceful to me.&mdash;But I flew directly to Matilda, who had been my only confidant in this &s;ecret, and communicated the letter to her.&mdash;She re|ceived me coldly, as &s;he had done before, on my former difficulty&mdash;told me that this too was but another of the <HI>common events of life</HI>&mdash;That the mo&s;t con&s;tant lovers were not to be con&s;idered more than <HI>perennials</HI>; but that Bath pa&s;&s;ions never la&s;ted, beyond the &s;ea&s;on&mdash;that
<PB N="66" REF="68">
they were in&s;pired by the heat of the wa|ters, and cooled as they did.</P>
<P>What makes girls &s;o woe-begone, &s;aid &s;he, upon &s;uch di&s;appointments, is the overweaning conceit they are too apt to frame of their own con&s;equence; but they mu&s;t abate con&s;iderably of their ro|mantic &s;elf-&s;ufficience, before they will find them&s;elves in the &s;tation where na|ture has de&s;igned them.&mdash;A toy, a rattle, which ten will play with, for one who will think of becoming a &s;erious purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>Such maxims as the&s;e, whether true or fal&s;e, were not likely to a&s;&s;uage my grief, and I returned home the mo&s;t un|happy creature breathing.&mdash;I accu&s;ed Captain L&mdash; of fal&s;ehood, of perjury,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
a thou&s;and times, alas! in vain, did I vow to ca&s;t him from my heart and memory for ever.&mdash;Pardon, thou dear departed &s;hade, the&s;e and all other injuries I have unwittingly been the &s;ad occa&s;ion of to you!</P>
<P>During my confinement, Mr. W&mdash; made the mo&s;t con&s;tant and obliging inquiries about me, and in the mo&s;t friendly manner offered my mother a hou&s;e he had near the Hot-wells at Bri&s;|tol, with the u&s;e of his carriage, &s;er|vants, &amp;c.&mdash;As I continued in a very low and languid &s;tate, even after my re|covery, change of air was judged nece&s;|&s;ary for me, particularly as the phy&s;i|cian who attended me, apprehended my falling into a con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">I had however, a very &s;trong objec|tion to accepting Mr. W&mdash;'s obliging offer, from an unwillingne&s;s to receiving farther favours from one, to whom I was already too much indebted.</P>
<P>But this difficulty was a good deal ob|viated, by his declaring that he was en|gaged on a party, for two months, to vi&s;it Paris; and during that time, both his hou&s;e and carriage mu&s;t be entirely u&s;ele&s;s to him.</P>
<P>At my mother's intreaty, and not op|po&s;ed by me, Matilda con&s;ented to ac|company us; and I own I felt a gleam of joy, at removing from a place, where every object reminded me of my unhap|pine&s;s: I did not then reflect that I could not fly from my&s;elf, and that neither hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery are local.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">Mr. W&mdash; accompanied us to Bri&s;|tol, and put us into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very elegant hou&s;e, in which he left four &s;er|vants to attend us, at board wages&mdash;There was an ample &s;upply of tea, wine, &s;weet-meats, and every elegance, which he in&s;i&s;ted on our u&s;ing, as if they were our own, and took his leave, in the polite&s;t manner, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting that he might find us there at his return.</P>
<P>The waters and the change of &s;cene certainly conduced to the recovery of my health; but peace and chearfulne&s;s were both e&s;tranged from my &s;ad bo&s;om, and the only moments I enjoyed, were tho&s;e in which I could prevail on Matilda to li&s;ten to my griefs.&mdash;I &s;oon di&s;covered that &s;he grew weary of the painful office; &s;he was totally immer&s;ed in gaiety, and
<PB N="70" REF="72">
u&s;ed oftener to rally, than &s;oothe my af|fliction.</P>
<P>Under all the di&s;advantages, which the gloomy veil of &s;orrow had ca&s;t ar|round me, a York&s;hire baronet, Sir James D&mdash;, &s;aw, and liked me; he immediately addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to my mo|ther, and was by her mo&s;t favourably received. She was overjoyed at the pro|&s;pect, of what &s;he called my happine&s;s, and &s;poke to me of Sir James's propo&s;al with tran&s;port.</P>
<P>This was the &s;econd <HI>outrage,</HI> if I may &s;o call it, that my heart had &s;uffered&mdash;I fell into an agony of grief, and before I could recollect my&s;elf, or &s;he prevent me, I vowed to heaven, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner, that I would never be Sir James's wife.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">Even at this moment, Edward, I be|hold the figure of my a&s;toni&s;hed, my of|fended mother! She had however, &s;o much rea&s;on at command, as not to urge my madne&s;s farther, but quitted the room, with a look of indignation, mingled with &s;urpri&s;e and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>In a few minutes I followed her into her chamber, and found her in tears; I could not bear them, Edward! I fell upon my knees before her, implored her pardon, and offered even to &s;acrifice my|&s;elf by marrying Sir James D&mdash;, ra|ther than render her wretched.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered with the utmo&s;t calm|ne&s;s, I fear, Maria, it is out of your power to prevent my being &s;o; you are unhappy, my child, and I mu&s;t &s;uffer

with you&mdash;I hoped&mdash;but it is over&mdash;For be a&s;&s;ured that after the vow you have &s;o ra&s;hly made, no power on earth &s;hould force me to con&s;ent to my child's perjury. Sir James &s;hall have his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But let me now inform you of a &s;ecret I wi&s;hed to have concealed for ever from you&mdash;Penury and want &s;urround us, and we &s;hall &s;oon be given up a prey to them&mdash;We mu&s;t return to Bath, no more. I will mortgage our little income, to pay our debts; in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner we mu&s;t labour for our bread, help to &s;up|port our&s;elves in hone&s;t indigence, and &s;trive to humble our minds to our con|ditions.</P>
<P>I do not condemn you, my child&mdash;Af|fections are not to be forced&mdash;I flattered
<PB N="73" REF="75">
my&s;elf that your youth and beauty might have obtained an advantageous match, which would have been a &s;upport to me, and an e&s;tabli&s;hment to your&s;elf. Sir James D&mdash;'s propo&s;al was beyond my hopes, but I do not wi&s;h to render you a victim for my &s;ake; nor &s;hall this &s;ub|ject ever be mentioned more between us.</P>
<P>O, my brother! think what I &s;uffered while my mother &s;poke&mdash;I would at that moment have died a thou&s;and deaths to have made her happy; yet even then I inwardly rejoiced at being relieved from my apprehen&s;ions of marrying a man I could not love.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e I uttered all that gratitude could dictate, for my mother's kindne&s;s, and promi&s;ed, for my future
<PB N="74" REF="76">
life, to know no will but hers&mdash;Talked of contented poverty; preferred an hum|ble lot with peace of mind, to &s;plendid mi&s;ery; and &s;trove in vain to combat with her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, I not only a&s;&s;umed, but felt a degree of chearfulne&s;s, to which my heart had long been a &s;tranger. I triumphed over Captain L&mdash;'s unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions; in the mid&s;t of poverty, I re|jected an advantageous &s;ettlement, and de&s;pi&s;ed a title which mu&s;t be bought at the expence of love.</P>
<P>I expected Matilda would have ap|plauded my heroi&s;m, but was di&s;appoint|ed&mdash;She di&s;approved my conduct, called me romantic and ab&s;urd, condemned my mother's want of &s;pirit, and &s;aid that
<PB N="75" REF="77">
had &s;he been in her place &s;he would have compelled me to marry Sir James D&mdash;, and made me happy in &s;pite of my own folly.&mdash;</P>
<P>In about four days after this event, Mr W&mdash;, whom we had imagined to be in France, returned to Bri&s;tol&mdash;As I was &s;en&s;ible of the highe&s;t gratitude to|wards him, I confe&s;s I felt a degree of plea&s;ure at his arrival, and received him with all the marks of regard due to a friend.</P>
<P>There was a vacant apartment in the hou&s;e, which he a&s;ked my mother's leave to occupy&mdash;&s;he certainly had not a right to refu&s;e, yet I could perceive that &s;he was va&s;tly embarra&s;&s;ed by the reque&s;t.&mdash;The next morning &s;he told me that &s;he
<PB N="76" REF="78">
was determined to quit Bri&s;tol, immedi|ately, though &s;he knew not where to bend her cour&s;e, as &s;he did not think it proper to remain longer in Mr. W&mdash;'s hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As this per&s;on was near fifty years of age, I had never con&s;idered him in any other light than as a father; however, the impropriety of living under his roof, any longer, &s;truck me as &s;oon as it was mentioned&mdash;I told her I was ready to at|tend her, when and wherever &s;he plea&s;|ed.&mdash;She bur&s;t into tears, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas, my child, who will receive the friendle&s;s widow, and her helple&s;s or|phan!"</Q></P>
<P>At that in&s;tant Mr. W&mdash;, who had overheard our di&s;cour&s;e, came into the
<PB N="77" REF="79">
room, and taking my mother's hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold in me, Madam, a pro|tector, and a &s;on, who will think him|&s;elf happy in making you &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t emotion of my heart, at this declaration, was gratitude&mdash;Mode&s;ty alone re&s;trained me from embracing Mr. W&mdash;; I cried out, in an exta&s;y, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Sir! you are too good, too generous! how &s;hall we ever be able to make you an amends?"</Q></P>
<P>He in&s;tantly replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is in your power, Madam, to overpay all my &s;er|vices; I a&s;k no more than that fair hand can give; but then your heart, as well as per&s;on mu&s;t be mine; without the fir&s;t, the latter would be worthle&s;s&mdash;I will not at this moment expect your an|&s;wer, you are fully appri&s;ed of your

mother's &s;entiments and &s;ituation, and you alone can tell whether you chu&s;e or not to dry her tears."</Q></P>
<P>He quitted the room directly, but he might have remained there, and talked for an hour, without hazarding any in|terruption from me; I was ab&s;olutely petrified with horror and &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;Be|fore I could recover my&s;elf, my mother, with her eyes &s;till &s;treaming, threw her|&s;elf on her knees before me, and pre&s;&s;ing my hand to her heart, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not a&s;k you, my beloved child, to &s;acri|fice your&s;elf for me&mdash;but, O con&s;ider, my Maria! to what in&s;ults and misfor|tunes your innocence and youth mu&s;t be expo&s;ed, when you &s;hall lo&s;e even the poor &s;upport you have in me&mdash;I know I cannot long endure di&s;tre&s;s,

<P>I could bear no more&mdash;I fell on my knees before her, I cla&s;ped her in my arms, and bathed her bo&s;om with my flowing tears, while I cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O take me, &s;acrifice me, do what you will with me, I will not be a parricide! But give me time to conquer this poor heart, and tear my L&mdash;'s much loved image from my brea&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>At the name of L&mdash; my mother &s;tart|ed up, and rai&s;ed me with her; then

looking at me with unutterable angui&s;h, &s;aid it mu&s;t not be, if your heart feels a pa&s;&s;ion for another object, I will much &s;ooner die than make you wretched.&mdash;But who is Mr. L&mdash;, and how has he de&s;erved Maria's love?&mdash;Shame kept me &s;ilent; but when my mother repeated her que&s;tion, I replied, do not pre&s;s me far|ther, Madam; Matilda can inform you both of my weakne&s;s and misfortune.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;hed to retire upon the in&s;tant, I opened a door that led by a few &s;teps into the garden,&mdash;In my confu&s;ion I mi&s;&s;|ed my footing, and fell from the top to the bottom.&mdash;My mother flew to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but could not rai&s;e me; &s;he called for help, and when Matilda and Mr. W&mdash;, who were in the garden, lift|ed me from the ground, I could not

<P>In the mid&s;t of the pain I &s;uffered, even during the action of &s;etting my an|cle, I &s;ecretly rejoiced in this accident, as it mu&s;t, at lea&s;t for &s;ome days, retard an event to me more horrible than death.&mdash;My heart was overflowing &s;till with fondne&s;s for the faithle&s;s L&mdash;, and I was &s;en&s;ible of <HI>too much re&s;pect</HI> for Mr. W&mdash;, to love him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of my confinement, my mother told me that Matilda had in|formed her of every particular relative to the attachment between Captain L&mdash; and me; that tho' &s;he con&s;idered it as a childi&s;h and romantic affair on my &s;ide,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
and a mere matter of galantry on his; yet her tenderne&s;s for me, had made her con&s;ent to Matilda's writing to him, and acquainting him with every particular of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and if, in an&s;wer to that letter, he &s;hould declare a &s;erious and honourable pa&s;&s;ion for me, &s;he &s;o|lemnly promi&s;ed never to oppo&s;e my in|clination, but chearfully wait his return, and yield her con&s;ent to our union, but if, on the contrary&mdash;</P>
<P>Stop there, my deare&s;t mother, I ex|claimed, you have outgone my wi&s;hes; for if Captain L&mdash; &s;hould he&s;itate a moment to receive me as his wife, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y hand, but my heart &s;hall then be free; and gratitude to the be&s;t of pa|rents &s;hall enable me to be&s;tow them, unreluctantly, on any per&s;on whom her prudence &s;hall &s;elect.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">My mother embraced me, and bathed my cheeks with tears of fondne&s;s. At that moment I thought my&s;elf the happie&s;t of mortals.&mdash;Matilda joined us, and read the letter &s;he had written to Captain L&mdash;. I did not think that it &s;uf|ficiently de&s;cribed either my affection or my di&s;tre&s;s; but as my mother approved of it, I did not pre&s;ume to make any ob|jection, but only engaged her promi&s;e to add a defence of my conduct, from the mi&s;apprehen&s;ions or mi&s;repre&s;enta|tations he &s;eemed to have conceived or received before, with regard to it.</P>
<P>You know, my Edward, that my mother was integrity it&s;elf; &s;he could not therefore bear to be guilty of the &s;malle&s;t deceit; and though Mr. W&mdash; had not pre&s;&s;ed for any an&s;wer to his pro|po&s;al,

on account of the accident that had happened to me, &s;he re&s;olved to tell him that there was a friend in America, without who&s;e con&s;ent I was determined never to marry; that this per&s;on had been written to, and that he &s;hould be in|formed of his an&s;wer, the moment it arrived.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash; received this information with a very ill grace, but acquie&s;ced &s;o far as to &s;ay, that he could have no doubt of this <HI>unheard of</HI> guardian's con&s;ent to &s;uch an offer as his; and as an an&s;wer might arrive before I was perfectly re|&s;tored to my health, there was no great harm in a&s;king it; but he did not &s;up|po&s;e that we &s;hould be weak enough to refu&s;e his alliance, even though this par|ticular friend might not approve of it.</P>

<P>Matilda was obliged to return to her hou&s;e at Bath; and as my mother &s;pent mo&s;t of her time in my chamber, and that Mr. W&mdash; was not permitted to make long vi&s;its to me, on pretence of the nece&s;&s;ity of my being kept quiet, he grew weary of pa&s;&s;ing his dome&s;tic hours alone, and to my very great joy, &s;et out for London.</P>

<P>I Shall proceed in my ta&s;k of copying, like a clerk in an office, without at|tending to any thing but the draft before me, and indeed, my Loui&s;a, I find it &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to engro&s;s all my attention.&mdash;If it can exclude tho&s;e plea&s;|ing &s;entiments which my pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s ought, and does in&s;pire, may I not rea&s;onably hope that it will be able to &s;u&s;pend, at lea&s;t during the time of reading it, that heavy weight which &s;eems to pre&s;s upon my &s;i&s;ters heart? Yes, I am per&s;uaded that it may, and un|der this belief, I rea&s;&s;ume the pen.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> MARIA, <HI>continued.</HI></P>
<P>In le&s;s than a month, I was able to walk, with a little help, and mo&s;t earn|e&s;tly wi&s;hed to quit Mr. W&mdash;'s hou&s;e; as I had rea&s;on to hope from the ju&s;tifi|cation of my character, which Matilda a&s;|&s;ured me &s;he had undertaken, that there would be an end of all connection be|tween us, the moment I &s;hould receive a letter from Captain L&mdash;; and that an interview, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, mu&s;t be painful to us both.</P>
<P>I therefore pre&s;&s;ed my mother to try to borrow the money &s;he wanted, at Bri&s;tol, and return to Bath.&mdash;She complied with my reque&s;t, and judged it nece&s;&s;ary to take up a larger &s;um, on her annuity, than &s;he at fir&s;t intended, as either my marriage with Mr. W&mdash;, or my wait|ing Captain L&mdash;'s return to England, mu&s;t be attended with expence.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">In &s;hort, on &s;uch terms as the poor borrow, and the rich lend, &s;he obtained two hundred pounds, which I then thought an immen&s;e &s;um; but did not con&s;ider that we owed more than half of it already, including my debt to Mr. W&mdash;</P>
<P>I am thus circum&s;tantial with you, my dear Edward, that you may be perfectly able to judge of the motives which im|pelled me to my ruin&mdash;O would to hea|ven, that I alone had been to &s;uffer the &s;o much dreaded ills of poverty! I would have braved them all; but a beloved, and tender parent, who&s;e fondne&s;s to|wards me had involved her in di&s;tre&s;s! It was not to be born.</P>
<P>My mother wrote a very polite letter to Mr. W&mdash;, thanking him for all his
<PB N="90" REF="92">
civilities, and acquainting him with our return to Bath, where he joined us in a few days&mdash;He brought &s;ome very hand|&s;ome jewels, and other pre&s;ents, from London, for me, which I ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed, and even felt my delicacy offended at his offering them, as it &s;eemed to hint at a certainty of my becoming his wife.</P>
<P>As the time approached when we might expect an an&s;wer from Captain L&mdash;, I counted the hours, and rejoi|ced in their flight; the anxiety of &s;u&s;|pence was vi&s;ible in my looks and words; I &s;tarted at every &s;ound, and minutely inquired the bu&s;ine&s;s of every per&s;on who rapped at the door. At length the fatal moment arrived that was to change a &s;tate of fond hope into the utmo&s;t de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">Matilda came to our hou&s;e one morn|ing, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee my mother alone; the gloom which &s;at on her brow, announced the tidings which &s;he brought, and though &s;carce able to utter a &s;yllable, I cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will not leave the room, I know the wor&s;t already, he is dead!"</Q> She an&s;wered coldly, no! and reached a letter to me&mdash;the contents whereof were as follows&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MATILDA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Honoured as I am by the favour of your letter, and happy in hearing of your health, will you not think me ungrate|ful if I repine at your wa&s;ting &s;o much of your time and paper, in relating par|ticulars of a per&s;on, who now only lives in my memory, from the bare recollec|tion
<PB N="92" REF="94">
of having &s;ometimes &s;een her with you?</P>
<P>But as all preferences are flattering, I &s;hould be unpolite not to thank mi&s;s S&mdash;, for an offer, which I mu&s;t how|ever decline. I heartily wi&s;h her happi|ne&s;s with Sir James D&mdash;, Mr. W&mdash;, or whom&s;oever el&s;e &s;he &s;hall think pro|per to honour with her fair hand, except|ing, Madam, your</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, T. L.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>My faculties were all &s;u&s;pended, for &s;everal minutes, after reading this in&s;ult|ing letter&mdash;
<Q><L>" No &s;igh to ri&s;e, no tear had power to flow."</L></Q>
I felt like one that had been &s;tunned by a &s;evere &s;troke&mdash;At length recovering
<PB N="93" REF="95">
my&s;elf, I flung the hated paper from me, and taking my mother's hand, &s;aid, with an effort of calmne&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How poor, Madam, is the &s;acrifice that I can now make to duty&mdash;A rejected hand, and heart! but di&s;po&s;e of them as you plea&s;e, and do it quickly, while my rea&s;on holds."</Q></P>
<P>My mother was more alarmed at my behaviour than &s;he would have been had I fallen into a pa&s;&s;ion, either of grief or rage&mdash;She wept abundantly, for my di&s;tre&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ed every &s;entiment of parental fondne&s;s&mdash;her kindne&s;s would have transformed me to a Niobe at any other time, but the &s;orrow that had then taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, was of too powerful a nature to be &s;oftened by her tears, or di&s;&s;ipated by my own&mdash;'Twas grief unutterable.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">My mother kindly indulged me, for &s;everal days, by allowing me to keep my chamber, on pretence of a &s;ore throat&mdash;this prevented my &s;eeing Mr. W&mdash;, and gave me time to reflect upon my own &s;ituation.&mdash;I con&s;idered my&s;elf as an offer|ing that was to be &s;acrificed, and deter|mined to &s;upport the r&ocirc;le that fate had allotted me, with becoming fortitude.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash; expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t im|patience for our marriage, and in about &s;ix weeks after the receipt of Captain L&mdash;'s letter, I was led to the altar, and became the wretched wife of Mr. W&mdash;.</P>
<P>In vain did I endeavour to a&s;&s;ume an air of chearfulne&s;s, with a breaking heart; unu&s;ed to deceit or artifice, the veil
<PB N="95" REF="97">
which I put on could not conceal the gloomy tints which &s;orrow had engraven upon my mind. I was hourly reproached by my hu&s;band with ill-temper and in|gratitude, and my mother was accu&s;ed of having drawn him into a match, &s;o much again&s;t his intere&s;t, and &s;o little conducive to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>For her dear &s;ake, I exerted my utmo&s;t powers to plea&s;e, but they &s;el|dom met with &s;ucce&s;s; and I, with un|&s;peakable grief, now &s;aw that &s;he was rendered infinitely more wretched by my marriage, than &s;he could have been in any other &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash;'s e&s;tate was in Devon|&s;hire; he had an old family &s;eat there, where I mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to &s;pend
<PB N="96" REF="98">
my days in &s;olitude and peace; but as he often told me, that he did not think we &s;hould make a plea&s;ant <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI> together there, he di&s;po&s;ed of his hou&s;e at Bri&s;tol, and hired one at Bath, from which he frequently made excur&s;ions to London, or el&s;e-where, for a month or &s;ix weeks at a time.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence, I &s;eldom &s;tirred abroad, unle&s;s to church, to pay &s;ome vi&s;it of ceremony, or to pa&s;s an hour, or perhaps an evening, with Matilda.</P>
<P>From the moment I was married I had never mentioned the name of Cap|tain L&mdash; to my mother, Matilda, or any other per&s;on&mdash;This was a &s;acrifice I thought due to my hu&s;band; I would have done more, had it been in my
<PB N="97" REF="99">
power, and bani&s;hed him for ever from my thoughts.</P>
<P>One evening, while Mr. W&mdash; was away, I was prevailed upon, by Matilda and my mother, to go to the Rooms, on a ball-night&mdash;I found my &s;pirits &s;trongly affected with a &s;cene that reminded me of happier days; and became &s;o much ab&s;orbed in my own reflections, that I &s;carce heard the &s;ound of the mu&s;ic, or ob&s;erved the motion of the dancers, though Matilda was among then.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting on one of the benches, oppo&s;ite the door of the room, and had continued a con&s;iderable time in my re|verie, when my eyes were accidentally caught by the figure of a per&s;on, who was &s;peaking to a lady that &s;at ju&s;t be|fore
<PB N="98" REF="100">
me&mdash;My mind he&s;itated, but my heart admitted not a doubt that it was Captain L&mdash;</P>
<P>Had I ever &s;creamed out in my life, I &s;hould have done &s;o then&mdash;So unex|pected a view had the &s;ame effect on me that is generally produced by thunder and lightning; it dimmed my &s;ight, and gave me &s;uch a &s;ickne&s;s in my &s;tomach that I could not long &s;upport; a &s;udden chilne&s;s &s;ucceeded this emotion, and my head reclined in&s;en&s;ibly on the &s;houlder of the lady who &s;at next to me.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed while I remained in that &s;tate, I know not, but when my &s;en&s;es returned, I found my&s;elf at home, my mother weeping by me, and Mr. W&mdash; &s;torming about the room like a mad|man
<PB N="99" REF="101" MS="y">
&mdash;not at my illne&s;s, but at the cau&s;e he imputed it to&mdash;for he declared, be|fore the &s;urgeon who had ju&s;t then bled me, that he had detected me in an in|trigue; and that on his &s;udden and unex|pected appearance, in the Rooms, at the moment I was conferring with my ga|lant, the various pa&s;&s;ions of love, hatred, and fear, had overpowered my &s;pirits, and occa&s;ioned my fainting.</P>
<P>What an infatuated di&s;temper is jea|lou&s;y! it reali&s;es chimeras, and draws conclu&s;ions, without premi&s;es&mdash;I was holding no conference with Captain L&mdash; he was only &s;peaking to a per&s;on who &s;at before me, nor did I &s;ee my hu&s;band, till I opened my eyes in my own chamber. However I &s;uffered him to pour forth his whole &s;tock of cau&s;ele&s;s abu&s;e with|out
<PB N="100" REF="102">
the lea&s;t interruption; till at length, not meeting with re&s;i&s;tance, his rage was exhau&s;ted, and the &s;urgeon and he retired together.</P>
<P>I was put into bed, and determined, as &s;oon as I was left alone, to tear the bandage off my arm, and &s;uffer my&s;elf to bleed to death; but before I could put my re&s;olution in practice, a thou|&s;and rea&s;ons pre&s;&s;ed forward to re&s;train my trembling hand&mdash;What had I done to merit death? Would not the de&s;perate deed confirm the &s;lander of my tyrant's tongue? And could I leave my mother at once oppre&s;&s;ed with her own grief, and my infamy!</P>
<P>Perhaps the love of life pleaded, though &s;ilently, even &s;tronger than the&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="103">
motives, and with-held me from my fir&s;t attempt towards guilt&mdash;Yet, O for|give me, Edward, that I now lament I did not perpetrate the fatal deed! I might have hoped for pardon of my fir&s;t crime, but can accumulated &s;ins find mercy! Yet if contrition may avail a wretch, I &s;till will dare to hope.</P>
<P>* * * * * *<LB>* * * * * *<LB>* * * * * *</P>
<P>Here, my Loui&s;a, I mu&s;t again break off my melancholy narrative, as I have been &s;o much broken in upon, all day, by company, that I find it impo&s;&s;ible to conclude it by this po&s;t; but as the mails to Ireland are &s;ometimes delayed by contrary winds, for &s;everal days, nay weeks, as I am told, you may po&s;&s;ibly receive the whole &s;tory at once&mdash;I will
<PB N="102" REF="104">
not therefore create a further interrup|tion by talking on any other &s;ubject, but conclude as u&s;ual,</P>

<P>ONCE more, my &s;i&s;ter, I return to the &s;ad ta&s;k of relating Maria's woes; I have not ventured to make any comment on her &s;tory, nor do I mean to attempt it: my Loui&s;a can rea&s;on far better than I, and deduce effects from their cau&s;es.</P>

<P><PB N="103" REF="105">The agitation of my &s;pirits had redu|ced my mind to a &s;tate of the lowe&s;t weakne&s;s; I wept the whole night through, and when my mother eame to my bed-&s;ide, in the morning, I was &s;carce able to an&s;wer her tender inquiries after my health.</P>
<P>She told me that Mr. W&mdash; was per|fectly well acquainted with my former attachment to Captain L&mdash;, though he had never given the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of it before&mdash;She &s;u&s;pected Matilda for having &s;upplied him with this infor|mation&mdash;That by &s;ome chance he had heard of his being at Bath, and came po&s;t from London, directly; but when he arrived at his hou&s;e, and heard that I was at the Rooms, he flew into the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid every thing
<PB N="104" REF="106">
again&s;t me that rage and mi&s;take could dictate.</P>
<P>My poor mother thought to qualify his fury, by a&s;&s;uring him that this was the fir&s;t night I had gone into the Rooms, &s;ince his ab&s;ence&mdash;Perhaps this might have confirmed his &s;u&s;picion, as it looked the more like an a&s;&s;ignation. He hurried on his cloaths, flew immediately to the a&s;&s;embly, and happened unlucki|ly, it &s;eems, ju&s;t to enter the door as Captain L&mdash; had walked up to the place where I &s;at.</P>
<P>He con&s;trued every thing again&s;t me, both appearances and &s;urmi&s;es&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tri|fles light as air,"</Q> &amp;c. In fine I was condemned, without further examin|ation, he declared his full determination
<PB N="105" REF="107">
not to live with me any longer, and commanded me to &s;et out immediately for his hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire, where he would take care that I &s;hould not ex|po&s;e my&s;elf, or di&s;honour him, any more for the future</P>
<P>Surely never was reprieve more wel|come to a &s;entenced wretch, than the latter part of this di&s;cour&s;e to me&mdash;I had langui&s;hed for &s;olitude, before my hu&s;|band's error had rendered me infamous; and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to fly from &s;ociety, before I had rea&s;on to apprehend that I &s;hould be abandoned by the world&mdash;But in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, both of mind and circum&s;tance, the idea of retirement, nay ab&s;olute &s;eclu&s;ion from the whole univer&s;e, except my mother, was doubly dear to my &s;ad heart.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">I &s;tarted up with all the alacrity of health, and chearfulne&s;s, and cried, I am ready to obey Mr. W&mdash;; let us be gone this moment, do not delay, my deare&s;t mother, but let us fly for ever from this hated place, this &s;cene of all my mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>She an&s;wered with a &s;igh, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your hu&s;band has refu&s;ed to let me go with you, or be a witne&s;s of the treatment, which you are too likely to receive un|der his tyranny&mdash;I &s;hall behold you, or your, mi&s;eries no more, but they will prey for ever on my heart&mdash;for I have cau&s;ed them all&mdash;Your filial duty, more than your own ambition, was the &s;ole motive which has rendered you a victim to this unequal match&mdash;I re&s;pected the opinions of the world, more than the
<PB N="107" REF="109">
philo&s;ophy of nature, and the &s;in of the parent is now &s;everely vi&s;ited on the unoffending child!"</Q>&mdash;We wept in each other's bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The thought of being &s;eparated from this virtuous, this tender parent, quite overpowered me, and I &s;unk almo&s;t &s;en&s;e|le&s;s upon my pillow&mdash;I knew that &s;he had not now even the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, when torn from me, and I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect that Mr. W&mdash; would have genero&s;ity or huma|nity &s;ufficient to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s, or a&s;&s;uage her grief.</P>
<P>During the few days I remained at Bath, after this event, I never &s;tirred out of my bed-chamber, nor &s;aw any crea|ture, except my dear mother and a maid
<PB N="108" REF="110">
&s;ervant, who had been hired upon this occa&s;ion, to watch, rather than attend me, and was appointed, as one may well &s;uppo&s;e, to be a &s;py upon all my actions during my exilement in Devon&s;hire.</P>
<P>The only favourable circum&s;tance that I remember, in this unhappy &s;ituation, was that Mr. W&mdash;, for I will no longer &s;tile him hu&s;band, no more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed me with his loath&s;ome pre&s;ence, or his foul reproaches, while I continued under his roof.</P>
<P>Matilda never once came near me all this while; but this was not the fir&s;t in&s;tance that gave me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect her of in&s;incerity and double dealing. I feared &s;he had been the &s;ole cau&s;e of the breach between Captain L&mdash;
<PB N="109" REF="111">
and me, and this idea not only in&s;pired me with my former pa&s;&s;ion for him, but added a tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to my &s;entiments, that rendered me infi|nitely more wretched than I was before: the brutality of Mr. W&mdash; &s;till fur|ther &s;trengthened my affections towards him, and the &s;tate of divorce to which his violence had now reduced me, di&s;|&s;olved that &s;olemn and honourable tie, which would otherwi&s;e have re&s;trained the wanderings of my heart, and ever pre&s;erved my duty faithful to him.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the pangs I felt, when the hour arrived in which I was to be torn from a fond mo|ther's conver&s;e&mdash;&s;he was all the world to me, at lea&s;t &s;he was all that I then thought truly loved me, in the world&mdash;
<PB N="110" REF="112">
We parted&mdash;and at her mo&s;t earne&s;t en|treaty, I promi&s;ed to write to Mr. W&mdash;, as &s;oon as my mind &s;hould be &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed, and to enter into a proper vin|dication of my hitherto irreproachable conduct.</P>
<P>More dead than alive, my duenna and I arrived at my de&s;tined pri&s;on&mdash;The hou&s;e was old, large, and gloomy, ex|tremely out of repair; the furniture as antique as the building, which was &s;itu|ated on a bleak and barren &s;hore, op|po&s;ite the Iri&s;h coa&s;t.&mdash;For the fir&s;t ten or twelve days that I pa&s;&s;ed in this di&s;|mal man&s;ion, I was delighted with the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olitude that &s;urrounded me&mdash;the family was compo&s;ed of only three maids, and an old gardener; and I have &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed a dozen hours

<PB N="111" REF="113">
without hearing any &s;ound, except the roaring of the &s;ea, the croaking of the ravens, or howling of a ma&s;tiff.</P>
<P>But when the agitation of my mind began a little to &s;ub&s;ide, I grew &s;en&s;ible to the horrors of my &s;ituation, and would have preferred a dungeon, with any hu|man creature I could conver&s;e with, to the liberty of &s;talking through an unin|habited range of chambers, in &s;ilence and &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Mona&s;teries afford &s;ociety, and goals are not de&s;titute of companions, which are a &s;olace even in mi&s;ery; but here I was both wretched, and alone&mdash;I u&s;ed often to con&s;ider my&s;elf as a delin|quent entombed alive, &s;ecluded from the univer&s;e, and only con&s;cious of ex|i&s;tence from continued regret.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">I &s;ought for amu&s;ement in books, and found none that were capable of afford|ing me any; the few volumes that I met with, were meant to in&s;pire devo|tion, but as they were written on fanatical principles, they were either &s;o ridiculou&s;|ly ab&s;urd as to create di&s;gu&s;t, or &s;o ex|tremely rigid as to induce de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In conformity to my promi&s;e, I had written to Mr. W&mdash;, but received no an&s;wer, and, what was infinitely more grievous to me, I had not the happine&s;s of hearing once from my mother, or any one el&s;e, though eight months had lag|ged with leaden &s;teps along, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of my confinement.</P>
<P>When the weather permitted, I &s;ome|times walked by the &s;ea &s;ide, and have
<PB N="113" REF="115">
frequently poured forth my &s;orrows to the deaf, unpitying waves.&mdash;Often, my Edward, have I &s;ighed out your name, and &s;ent forth ardent prayers for your return, to comfort and &s;upport our hap|le&s;s mother! Yet I will own that the loved &s;ound of L&mdash;, &s;till oftener pa&s;&s;ed my lips&mdash;Was this a crime? My affec|tions were thrown back upon my hands, and this methought gave me a right to transfer them.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I had remained in my exile for a tedious interval, when one fine evening, having indulged my reveries by the &s;ea &s;ide longer than u&s;ual, the twilight coming on warned me of re|turning home, when I &s;aw two men, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, walking &s;lowly behind me&mdash;a &s;ight &s;o unu&s;ual, joined to an ap|prehen&s;ion

that they might have over|heard my &s;oliloquy, put my &s;pirits into a flutter; though from their pace and manner, they did not &s;eem as if they in|tended to pur&s;ue me&mdash;I was &s;eized with an univer&s;al tremor, my limbs could &s;carce &s;upport me, and I could march but &s;lowly on.</P>
<P>Before I was able to recover my&s;elf, and mend my &s;peed, one of the per&s;ons came up to me, while the other retired, as if for fear of alarming me&mdash;I did not venture even to look at him, and began to mend my pace; but &s;ight was u&s;ele&s;s, when his well known voice uttered the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O fear no injury from me, my dear deceived, unhappy, and &s;till ador|ed Maria!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">Surpri&s;e, terror, hope, fear, love, an|ger, grief, and joy&mdash;in &s;hort every pa&s;|&s;ion of the human heart, hatred alone excepted, ru&s;hed through my mind, and totally deprived me of the power of ut|terance, while he&mdash;need I write his name?&mdash;taking advantage of my &s;ilence, pro|ceeded thus.</P>

<P>At length, towards evening, I began to recover my&s;elf again&mdash;I am not &s;uper|&s;titious; be&s;ides, what crime had I ever committed, that might conjure up &s;pec|tres from the grave! My life had been

innocent, though unhappy, and my mind continued pure, though injured and provoked.</P>
<P>The reflections which this incident &s;tirred up in my thoughts, more par|ticularly at this time, with regard to my dear father's goodne&s;s and virtue, &s;erved principally to compo&s;e my &s;pirits to peace&mdash;He was indeed a perfect chri&s;tian, both in faith and works; his character and conver&s;ation were of a piece; his ex|ample was precept, he urged no borrow|ed morals, but preached the very prac|tice of his life&mdash;his doctrines were &s;trict, yet indulgent; charitable, though &s;e|vere&mdash;his au&s;terity was only in his ma|xims and his mind; his mildne&s;s in his cen&s;ures and his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127">The&s;e pious thoughts wrought me up to an enthu&s;ia&s;m of devotion; I fell on my knees to thank Heaven for having been derived from two &s;uch pure &s;ources, as my father and mother, and prayed mo&s;t fervently, that I might never be guilty of any thought or deed, which &s;hould render me unworthy of &s;uch faultle&s;s originals.</P>
<P>As the hour approached when I was to meet Captain L&mdash;, the terrors of my mind increa&s;ed; yet I found my&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly impelled, from the motives already mentioned, joined to a curio&s;ity to know where the blame lay, between Matilda and him, that I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of hazarding the interview. I went &s;oftly down the back &s;tairs, which led from a clo&s;et within my apartment,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
and found my way out, un&s;een by any of the family.</P>
<P>The agitation of my &s;pirits was &s;o violent, that I &s;carce knew what I did; I &s;ometimes ran towards the &s;hore, as if I had been pur&s;ued by wild bea&s;ts; then &s;topped, and &s;tood motionle&s;s, as if my faculties had cea&s;ed.&mdash;At length, I perceived Captain L&mdash;, at &s;ome di&s;|tance; he flew to me, and caught me in his arms; I bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, and was incapable of utterance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I could recover my &s;peech, I a&s;&s;umed all the dignity of re&s;entment, and told him that he was no longer to con&s;ider me as the weak tender Maria S&mdash;, but as an injured and offended judge, who came to hear the poor de|fence

which he could make, for having &s;o ungenerou&s;ly wronged, and &s;o cruelly injured her.</P>
<P>Again he pre&s;&s;ed me to his bo&s;om, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O could I but repair the wrongs you have &s;uffered, as ea&s;ily as I can prove I never was the author of them, my loved Maria &s;hould be mine and happy&mdash;and it &s;hall &s;till be &s;o&mdash;Victims of artifice and fraud, &s;hall we continue to be wretched, becau&s;e Ma|tilda and your hu&s;band have concur|red to render us &s;o."</Q></P>

<P>He then begged that I would hear him ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and began by informing me, that about a year before my arrival at Bath, he had gone there, as mo&s;t young people do, in que&s;t of amu&s;ement; that he happened to lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Matilda, and her hu&s;band, who both &s;ought and cultivated his acquaint|ance; and as he had no particular attach|ment to any other per&s;ons there, he de|voted him&s;elf intirely to them, was of all their parties, and never ab&s;ent from them.</P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;ed that he liked Matilda, better than any woman then at Bath, and
<PB N="129" REF="131">
that he began to flatter him&s;elf he was not di&s;agreeable to her; from the levity of her manners, he had rea&s;on to believe &s;he was not over&s;trict in her morals, and on her hu&s;band's being obliged to go to London, for a few days, &s;he convinced him that he had not been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Their guilty commerce la&s;ted but a &s;hort time; it began without pa&s;&s;ion, and of cour&s;e terminated in indifference, at lea&s;t on his &s;ide. He quitted Bath without any de&s;ign of ever returning, though Matilda and her hu&s;band had ta|ken a hou&s;e, and determined to fix their re&s;idence there.</P>
<P>Some months after, he was attacked with a violent bilious complaint, and ordered to Bath by his phy&s;icians; and

<P>When &s;he found her arts were un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, &s;he changed her battery, and pretended to conceive a particular friend|&s;hip for me, and became our mutual confidant; but at the &s;ame time, from her &s;uperior regard for Captain L&mdash;, u&s;ed often to remon&s;trate to him, how much his family would be offended at his marrying a girl without rank or fortune.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e arts and in&s;inuations he vowed had not the lea&s;t manner of effect
<PB N="131" REF="133">
upon his mind, or heart; his pa&s;&s;ion was too firmly founded, on admiration and e&s;teem, to be &s;o ea&s;ily &s;haken, and he declared that at the &s;ad moment of our parting, his whole affections and &s;ole purpo&s;e in life, were pointed to|wards our mutual happine&s;s and honour together.</P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;ed, however, that during the unlucky interval of ab&s;ence, the hints and repre&s;entations of Matilda had wrought by degrees, the malicious ef|fect intended by them; for &s;he had framed a novel again&s;t me, with &s;o much ad|dre&s;s and ingenuity, &s;o guarded at all points, that each part of it &s;eemed to vouch the truth of the re&s;t.</P>

&s;he mo&s;t wickedly repre&s;ented to him as a vice of mine, and reported the cir|cum&s;tances of my debt to Mr. W&mdash;, which &s;he al&s;o exaggerated, with &s;uch reflections as placed me in the &s;hocking light of a girl who was re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of her youth and beauty, with|out any further regard to morals or character.</P>
<P>In fine, he acknowledged that the plau&s;ible manner in which &s;he gave him the&s;e advices, from time to time, with the tender and compa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;|&s;ions &s;he affected now and then to let drop, upon the unhappine&s;s of my con|duct, had at length &s;o intirely injured me in his e&s;teem, that it occa&s;ioned his writing me the letter, before mentioned, when he was going to &s;et &s;ail for America.</P>

<P><PB N="175" REF="177">Fear gave wings to my &s;peed, yet at the &s;ame time retarded my flight; for though I ran as fa&s;t as it was po&s;&s;ible, I frequently &s;topped, for &s;everal minutes, to li&s;ten to every &s;ound I heard; and &s;ometimes clambered over high ditches, and laid my&s;elf flat on the ground, to prevent my being &s;een, in ca&s;e I was pur&s;ued; though the night was &s;o dark, that I could almo&s;t feel an object be|fore I &s;aw it.</P>

I &s;at my&s;elf down in the corner of a field, &s;urrounded by a little coppice, ju&s;t high enough to conceal me from the view of pa&s;&s;engers&mdash;Here nature, till now re|&s;trained, &s;till active for its own relief, began to relea&s;e the utterances of grief, and at the very moment that I felt my heart going to bur&s;t a&s;under, my tears broke forth, and I found my&s;elf at libery to expre&s;s my &s;ufferings, in moanings and exclamations.</P>
<P>This gave me ea&s;e, at fir&s;t, and I therefore indulged it, for a while, till I began to apprehend, towards day, that the loudne&s;s of my complaints might po&s;&s;ibly reach the ear of &s;ome traveller or villager, and betray the &s;ituation of my concealment, and the particular cir|cum&s;tances of my &s;tory&mdash;But yet I could

<P>At length my voice was heard, and an&s;wered by one who came ru&s;tling through the coppice, and in a &s;oft &s;len|der tone, cried out, Where are you, who are you, and what ails you?

<P>The prettine&s;s of the child's per&s;on, with the good-natured impatience and anxiety it expre&s;&s;ed about my &s;ituation, charmed me in that in&s;tant of di&s;tre&s;s and woe, till he came up clo&s;e to me; when I felt a &s;udden &s;hock, at the &s;ight of him&mdash;He &s;eemed to be a &s;on of Mr. W&mdash;'s; he had every feature of his face&mdash;I &s;tarted and trembled&mdash;however, I &s;oon recovered my&s;elf, concluding that &s;uch an idea mu&s;t be owing merely to the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion which his coun|tenance had made on my mind, at our

<P>I was received at the door of the hou&s;e, by a lady of a genteeler appear|ance than one could naturally expect to have met with, under &s;o mean a roof, who with a voice of &s;weetne&s;s welcomed me to what ho&s;pitality her circum&s;tances could afford, and taking me by the hand, led me into her be&s;t apartment&mdash;I &s;at down on the fir&s;t chair I could reach,

<P><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> Mrs. N&mdash;.</P>
<P>My mother was the only child of Cap|tain H&mdash;, a younger brother of a di&s;|tingui&s;hed family; her ill fortune brought her acquainted, very young, with Mr. W&mdash;, while he was a &s;tudent at Ox|ford, and under age&mdash;They &s;aw, liked, and wedded, without the con&s;ent of pa|rents on either &s;ide&mdash;Captain H&mdash; was afterwards made acquainted with the marriage, but died before my other grandfather, from whom it was thought prudent to keep it &s;till a &s;ecret, as my dear mother inherited but a very incon|&s;iderable
<PB N="196" REF="200">
portion. This was made a pretence for keeping their union con|cealed, during the life of his father; and my mother, who tenderly loved her hu&s;band, con&s;ented to let their connec|tion &s;till wear the veil of my&s;tery, ra|ther than injure his intere&s;t, or offend his father.</P>
<P>The doubtfulne&s;s of her &s;ituation by degrees detached her own friends in|tirely from her, and, for &s;ome years be|fore the death of his father, &s;he lived in perfect &s;olitude, hardly ever &s;eeing any per&s;on but her hu&s;band and me, her only child, who were the &s;ole objects of her care and affection.</P>
<P>I was about &s;even years old when my grandfather W&mdash; died, and I am
<PB N="197" REF="201">
per&s;uaded that if my mother felt any joy upon that occa&s;ion, it was for my &s;ake only, as &s;he wi&s;hed to have my legitimacy acknowledged, and my edu|cation properly attended to&mdash;A long ha|bit of retirement had weaned her from the world, and though of an age to re|li&s;h all its plea&s;ures, being then but four and twenty, &s;he thought of return|ing into it rather with di&s;gu&s;t than delight.</P>
<P>Upon various pretences my father declined owning his marriage, for about two years, and the gentlene&s;s of my mo|ther's temper prevented her from im|portuning him, on this or any &s;ubject; but when &s;o long an interval had elap&s;ed, &s;ince his father's death, and that &s;he per|ceived a vi&s;ible alteration in his beha|viour
<PB N="198" REF="202">
towards her, &s;he with the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;hes to live with him publicly as his wife&mdash;He &s;trove for near a year more, to evade her reque&s;t; but when her apprehen|&s;ions began to be alarmed by his conduct, and that &s;he ventured &s;o far as to pre&s;s him on the &s;ubject, he &s;lew into a rage, and utterly denied his having ever been married to her.</P>
<P>Tears and prayers were all the wea|pons with with &s;he attempted to a&s;&s;ert her rights&mdash;They had, alas! no power on his obdurate heart&mdash;Grief preyed upon her tender frame, and when I had ju&s;t entered my tenth year, &s;he fell into a con&s;umption&mdash;&s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her approaching fate, and though &s;he had remitted her own claim to my father's
<PB N="199" REF="203">
rank or fortune, &s;he determined not to leave me in the power of a man who had abandoned her to unmerited infamy, but immediately to &s;et about proving her marriage, and by that means entitling me both to his name, and a proper pro|vi&s;ion from his fortune.</P>
<P>She &s;oon found out that Doctor N&mdash;, the clergyman who had married her, lived in the pari&s;h of &mdash;, in this &s;hire; and that my grandfather, old Mr. W&mdash;, had pre&s;ented him to that living, which was incumbent on &s;ome part of my fa|ther's e&s;tate&mdash;She took me with her, and &s;et out immediately for his hou&s;e; which expedition &s;he could ea&s;ily make with|out her hu&s;band's knowledge, as they had &s;eldom lived under the &s;ame roof to|gether for &s;ome time pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="204">It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s this worthy man's &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ight of my mother and me, as my father had informed him that &s;he was dead above three years before, left no child, and earne&s;t|ly reque&s;ted him never to mention his having been married to her, as it could an&s;wer no end to her then, would cer|tainly di&s;oblige &s;ome of his relations, through who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;aid, he had conceived rea&s;onable hopes of &s;trength|ening his intere&s;t in the &s;hire, and of im|proving his fortune.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my mother had acquainted him with her &s;tory, the good old man promi&s;ed her to pay a vi&s;it, the next day, to my father, who had been his pupil at the univer&s;ity, and endeavour to influence him, by gentle means, to
<PB N="201" REF="205">
do her the ju&s;tice he owed her, rather than reduce her to the irk&s;ome nece&s;|&s;ity of expo&s;ing him and her&s;elf, by an appeal to &s;ome higher and more legal tribunal; a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame time, that if his mediation &s;hould not be at|tended with that &s;ucce&s;s which he wi&s;hed, and had rea&s;on to expect from it, he would no longer he&s;itate a moment about proving the marriage, through all the forms of law.</P>
<P>My dear unhappy mother wept and thanked him, and the doctor, accord|ing to his promi&s;e, proceeded the next day to Ca&s;tle W&mdash;, which is about ten miles from this village, being the man&s;ion &s;eat where my father then re&s;ided. It happened that he was from home, at the time the doctor went to his hou&s;e;
<PB N="202" REF="206">
and in the fullne&s;s of his zeal, he wrote him an admonitory letter upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, and returned much di&s;appointed at not having &s;een him.</P>
<P>In a few days after this event, my father came to doctor N&mdash;'s, and en|deavoured to make my mother's mind ea&s;y upon the equivocal appearances of his conduct towards her, imputing it all to the prudential rea&s;ons he had before mentioned to the doctor, in which he &s;aid that the future welfare of her&s;elf and family were equally intere&s;ted; adding, that their living together in England could not be long concealed, but that he was ready to retire with her to any part of Flanders, upon pretence of his going to travel for a few years, till the &s;chemes he had in agitation might be
<PB N="203" REF="207">
brought to bear, when they might re|turn home again and enjoy the remain|der of their lives in happine&s;s and ho|nour together.</P>
<P>My dear mother, as was natural to an un&s;u&s;pecting and ingenuous mind, was fondly amu&s;ed with this artifice, and wept with tran&s;port, at his mock pro|fe&s;&s;ions; the doctor too ble&s;&s;ed his pu|pil, with tears of joy, and my father re|turned back to Ca&s;tle W&mdash;, the next day, in order to prepare every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary towards our departure for the continent, without any further delay.</P>
<P>But this delu&s;ion did not long con|tinue, for the morning after he had left us, Mr. N&mdash;, a young en&s;ign, and nephew to Doctor N&mdash;, happened to

come from Exeter, where he was then &s;tationed, to pay a vi&s;it to his uncle; and among other articles of news, told him that his landlord and patron, as he &s;tiled my father, was &s;oon to be mar|ried to a young lady of family and for|tune, in the city he came from, and that he &s;uppo&s;ed the doctor would be then called upon to perform the ceremony.</P>
<P>The young man had never heard any thing of our &s;tory, and only men|tioned this particular among &s;ome other indifferent circum&s;tances of the time&mdash;His uncle did not open his mind to him upon the &s;ubject, but retired immediately to my mother's apartment, who happened luckily not to be by when this matter was related, and after endeavouring to prepare her as much as

<P>To you, dear Madam, who &s;eem to have known affliction, it mu&s;t be need|le&s;s to de&s;cribe the emotions of my un|happy mother, upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;The humane doctor N&mdash; &s;aid every thing he could think of, to a&s;&s;wage her di&s;traction, and repeated the promi&s;e he had made her before, of concurring with her in an immediate vindication of her rights, &s;eeing there was now no time to lo&s;e, and that it was &s;ufficiently apparent Mr. W&mdash; meant to take advantage of her too long acquie&s;cence under the concealment of her marriage, and, by this new and more public engagement, to bar her claim forever.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="210">He confe&s;&s;ed, that notwith&s;tanding his plau&s;ible profe&s;&s;ions to them both, at part|ing, his mind could not help &s;till har|bouring &s;ome doubts with regard to the &s;incerity of them&mdash;For however, &s;aid he, my chri&s;tianity may incline me to a perfect faith in the efficacy of divine grace, one is naturally apt to &s;u&s;pect your extempore converts, e&s;pecially where the reformation &s;eems, as in this ca&s;e, to have been brought about by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome pre&s;ent urgency.</P>
<P>He concluded then, that my father's &s;cheme, in carrying my mother and me out of the kingdom, mu&s;t be to &s;epa|rate us from the advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of whatever friends we might have here, and that being bereft of the protection of Engli&s;h laws, he meant to &s;hut us up

in a convent together, for life, upon &s;ome forged pretence or other; which would leave him at liberty to return in triumph home again, and complete his ba&s;e purpo&s;e with his new mi&s;tre&s;s at Exeter.</P>
<P>That very day doctor N&mdash; gave my mother a regular certificate of her marriage, &s;igned by him&s;elf, as the clergyman who had performed the cere|mony, referring to the page of the pari&s;h regi&s;try, where that tran&s;action was en|tered; at the bottom of which he put a memorandum of the names of the two witne&s;&s;es who were pre&s;ent, one of which is &s;till alive, if that were an article of any manner of con&s;equence to me now.</P>
<P>The next day my father came to the hou&s;e, with a carriage to convey us off
<PB N="208" REF="212">
privately, through the country, to Wey|mouth, where he told us he had pre|pared a &s;hip to &s;ail over directly to the continent. My mother made no reply, but wept, and quitted the room, to leave Dr. N&mdash; at liberty to explain the rea|&s;on of her &s;ilence and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Their conver&s;ation was warm, but &s;hort&mdash;The doctor made remon&s;trances to him upon his behaviour, both from religion, morals, and the laws; which my father re&s;ented with the highe&s;t in|temperance, declaring that he had happily one way &s;till left, to &s;creen him&s;elf from per&s;ecution and pro&s;ecu|tion both, and then ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e; which expre&s;&s;ion was, &s;oon af|ter, more fully explained, by hearing that he had gone off to France, whither no legal proce&s;s could pur&s;ue him,</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="213">The&s;e tran&s;actions were kept a perfect &s;ecret from me for &s;everal years&mdash;My fond mother thought it too &s;oon for me to become acquainted with affliction, and our worthy protector had al&s;o conceived a certain delicate idea, about me, with regard to vice&mdash;His opinion was cer|tainly ju&s;t, that the longer young people are kept ignorant of it, the &s;afer for their morals&mdash;Purity of thought, and inno|cence of action, &s;hould be &s;uffered to gain &s;trength by habit, before they know that there is &s;uch a thing as wickedne&s;s in human nature&mdash;The &s;hock and ab|horrence will be the greater on the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the danger of example le&s;s.</P>
<P>Doctor N&mdash; kept us with him, and &s;upported us out of his own fortune, while my poor mother lived, or rather
<PB N="210" REF="214">
langui&s;hed, which &s;he did for about two years, and then expired of a broken heart. The doctor was &s;o generous as to make her la&s;t moments ea&s;y, by pro|mi&s;ing to take care of me, till he could force my father, by law, to make a pro|vi&s;ion for me, as his legitimate child; &s;aying, that he thought it his duty to pay the debt of gratitude he owed to my grandfather, to the only part of his family now that de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>My father's emi&s;&s;aries &s;oon informed him of my mother's death, and he re|turned to his &s;eat, a joyful widower&mdash;The doctor immediately applied to him on my behalf, but &s;o far from being &s;oftened by his interce&s;&s;ion, he loaded him with abu&s;e, and threatened him with ruin if he did not in&s;tantly con&s;ent to

<P>Faithful to his promi&s;e, the doctor re|fu&s;ed to give him the &s;atisfaction he re|quired, nor would he con&s;ent to my going into a convent, upon any terms. Con&s;cious of the purity of his life and actions, he di&s;regarded my father's threats, and continued to treat me with the &s;ame kindne&s;s as if I had been his daughter.</P>
<P>My Father, who was lord of the ma|nor, &s;tirred up mo&s;t of the doctor's pari|&s;hioners to non-payment of tithes, and

<P>This be&s;t of men breathed his la&s;t &s;igh in a pri&s;on, about three years after my mother's death, and mu&s;t latterly have wanted even the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, but for the duty and affection of his nephew, who was now become a captain, and more than &s;hared his little income
<PB N="213" REF="217">
with him and me, who, from the time that my dear guardian was thrown into confinement, had been placed by him to board and lodge with the wife of his pari&s;h-clerk.</P>
<P>During all the &s;ufferings of this true divine, he was never prompted to revile the cruel author of them; nor to repine at the wretched &s;tate to which he was re|duced; and even to his la&s;t moments comforted and exhorted both me, and his fellow pri&s;oners, to bear their cro&s;&s;es with re&s;ignation, with chearfulne&s;s, and with forgivene&s;s to their per&s;ecutors and oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>

He was a very worthy agreeable young man, we had in&s;en&s;ibly conceived a liking for each other, and ju&s;t before his uncle's death, he a&s;ked his con&s;ent to offer his hand and heart to me.</P>
<P>The good man confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much plea&s;ed at this overture, and upon men|tioning it to me, &s;aid, that when I &s;hould no longer have a protector in him, I mu&s;t be either thrown upon the world, to get my bread in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, which he thought both dangerous, and improper for me, or obliged to &s;ue to my father for a &s;upport, which he feared he would refu&s;e, unle&s;s he were to confine me in a convent, which he mo&s;t earne&s;tly

entreated me not to con&s;ent to, but to per&s;evere in &s;uffering for the faith wherein I had been bred.</P>
<P>And with regard to his nephew, he paid me the compliment to think I was capable of rendering him happy, and that eventually I might turn out a good for|tune to him, either by my father's death, or reformation.

<P>The fir&s;t thing that occurred to my mind, upon this tragical event, was the benefit that my humane and ho&s;pitable friend of the cottage, and her lovely child, might po&s;&s;ibly receive from it; and I had the &s;atisfaction, before I left the kingdom, to hear that Mrs. N&mdash; had &s;ufficiently proved her mother's marriage, by the certificate and witne&s;s, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ca&s;tle W&mdash;, as &s;ole heire&s;s to her father's e&s;tate and fortune, which were very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="249">I did not make my&s;elf known to her, as under our different circum&s;tances no manner of connection could ever pro|perly have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us; but, as I was entitled to a jointure of four hundred pounds a year, by marriage &s;ettlement, I put the deed, which had been left in my mother's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, into the hands of an attorney at Che&s;ter, to claim my rights, which were not denied; and on receipt of the fir&s;t payment I quitted England, for ever, and came over here to France, with a purpo&s;e of retiring immediately into a convent, for life.</P>
<P>I began my narrative of woe, before I left England, and have completed it &s;ince I came over, and &s;hall put it into the India Hou&s;e for you, at Paris, if I
<PB N="246" REF="250">
may have life enough to carry me thi|ther, as I de&s;ign to fix my re&s;idence in &s;ome of the di&s;tant provinces beyond it. But I have been confined here, the&s;e two days, not being able to proceed further, from the failure of my &s;trength, and the dejection of my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t brother! may watchful angels hover round you, and guard and guide your foot&s;teps in the paths of virtue! I feel my&s;elf growing weaker, every line I write, and think that here my journey and my cares will &s;hortly end together.

my vi&s;it, which both &s;he and Sir Harry promi&s;ed &s;hould be in ten days, or a fortnight&mdash;Harriet declined my in|dulgence, and entreated me, with un|common earne&s;tne&s;s, to take her with me&mdash;I con&s;idered her refu&s;al as the ef|fect of her attention and complai&s;ance to me, till with a very &s;olemn air &s;he &s;aid to me, when we were alone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If <HI>you,</HI> Madam, think it nece&s;&s;ary to quit Elm-grove, I am &s;ure <HI>I</HI> ought to do &s;o too."</Q> I acquie&s;ced in her opinion, and de&s;ired her to get ready immediately.</P>

<P>Her &s;urmi&s;e was equal to conviction, and I that moment beheld my&s;elf the

<P>I need not attempt to de&s;cribe the di&s;traction of my mind, during the jour|ney. Harriet was &s;o vi&s;ibly affected with my grief, though unknowing of the cau&s;e, that I would, if po&s;&s;ible, have con|cealed it from her; and even accu&s;ed my&s;elf for making her heart &s;o early ac|quainted with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Southfield, Ben|&s;on, with tears in her eyes, informed me, that Sir William was dangerou&s;ly ill; the vein in his lungs, which had been clo&s;ed, for &s;ome time, had opened, and the phy&s;ician who attended him, had but

very faint hopes of his life&mdash;The agony which this account threw me into, I &s;hall leave to your own &s;en&s;ibility to im|agine&mdash;I fell upon my knees, and in an heart felt exta&s;y, cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gracious God! have pity on me! &s;pare my hu&s;band's life! and let not his murderer triumph over him and me, at once!"</Q></P>
<P>Harriet and Ben&s;on rai&s;ed me from the ground, with a mingled expre&s;&s;ion of pity and horror in their looks&mdash;they thought me mad&mdash;I was, alas! too &s;en|&s;ible, at lea&s;t to mi&s;ery!&mdash;When I became a little more calm, Harriet a&s;ked me if I would not go to &s;ee Sir William? I &s;tarted up at the que&s;tion, and would have flown that moment to his bed-&s;ide, had not Ben&s;on interpo&s;ed, by telling me he was ju&s;t fallen into a &s;lumber, and that the doctor had given orders he &s;hould not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="264">The idea that his mind was at re&s;t afforded a little ea&s;e to my own; the tears ran &s;ilent and plenteous down my cheeks, while my heart offered up the mo&s;t fer|vent petitions to the fountain of life, for his recovery!&mdash;By degrees I became compo&s;ed, and, at Harriet's entreaty, I tried to eat, and retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the morning, doctor Hartford, who attends Sir William, de&s;ired to &s;ee me&mdash;He told me that the &s;udden and violent return of his patient's di&s;order had proceeded from &s;ome perturbation of mind, and that the only chance he had for his life, was the being kept in a &s;tate of apathy, as much as po&s;&s;ible, and advi&s;ed my not &s;eeing him, for &s;ome days yet, as even the mo&s;t plea&s;ing emo|tion might be productive of fatal con|&s;equences.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord HUME to Lord LUCAN.</HEAD>
<P>WOULD you believe it, Lucan, I am become a philo&s;opher! and that by the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible means, ex|perience&mdash;I find there is no &s;uch thing as permanent happine&s;s, for in the very moment that I looked down with pity upon kings, my cup has been da&s;hed with a good &s;mart do&s;e of coloquintida.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time before my marriage, both Sir George Cleveland and I ob&s;erv|ed that my dear Fanny was frequently dejected, and melancholy; but whenever we &s;eemed to take notice of this indi&s;po|&s;ition of mind, &s;he attributed it to the change of climate, and immediately a&s;|&s;umed an air of chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="273">For my own part, I &s;ometimes thought that her unea&s;ine&s;s might pro|ceed from a recollection of my former conduct, and therefore endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate her &s;u&s;picions, by every mark of the &s;incere&s;t attachment&mdash;I flattered my&s;elf I had &s;ucceeded, as &s;he had gi|ven me her hand without the lea&s;t affec|tation of reluctance, which young la|dies &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ume the appearance of, in order to enhance the value of the gift.</P>
<P>I think there never was a blither bridegroom than my&s;elf&mdash;indeed I felt my&s;elf mo&s;t truly happy&mdash;Yet my Fanny's fits of melancholy frequently returned, and I have &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;|ed her in tears! I u&s;ed to ki&s;s them off, and begged to know the cau&s;e; &s;he con&s;tantly evaded my reque&s;t, but with
<PB N="270" REF="274">
&s;o much tenderne&s;s and delicacy, that I could not in&s;i&s;t on her compliance, or even let her &s;ee that I was unhappy my|&s;elf, le&s;t it &s;hould render her more &s;o.</P>
<P>In this kind of <HI>mortal &s;tate</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal weeks; but a letter that was de|livered to her lately, has unravelled the my&s;tery.&mdash;We were alone in her dre&s;|&s;ing-room when it was brought to her&mdash;While &s;he read it her countenance changed &s;o vi&s;ibly, that I could not avoid taken notice of it to her; &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and exclaimed, my unhappy &s;i&s;ter! What! is &s;he dead? I a&s;ked&mdash;Not yet, &s;he an&s;wered, and &s;unk back as if near fainting in her chair&mdash;By Heaven, Lucan, I would not go through &s;uch another moment, for the diamond eyes of the Indian idol&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;that are computed to be worth a million and a half!</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="275">As &s;oon as &s;he had recovered, &s;he en|treated me not to mention what had happened, to Sir George, or his lady; then told me that Lady Barton was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable being upon earth, from the villainy of a vile fellow who lives in their neighbourhood, and was him&s;elf in love with her, who, by a fal&s;e accu&s;a|tion of her to her hu&s;band, has rendered him &s;o outrageou&s;ly jealous, as almo&s;t to endanger Sir William's life; that, from her &s;i&s;ter's letters, &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that &s;he al&s;o was dying, and implored me to &s;et out for Ireland with her imme|diately, in order to re&s;cue lady Barton, if po&s;&s;ible, by removing her from that &s;cene of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I readily acquie&s;ced in her de&s;ire, di&s;covering &s;till new charms in her ten|der
<PB N="272" REF="276">
and generous affection for her un|happy &s;i&s;ter, which has been the &s;ole &s;ource of her melancholy&mdash;She gave me many prudent rea&s;ons for not acquaint|ing her brother with this affair; &s;o that our &s;cheme was mentioned at dinner, as a &s;udden thought, and every thing was fixed for our &s;etting out in two days&mdash;But pity me, Lucan, when I tell you that my whole of life, my heart's dear Fanny, was taken ill that night, the next day grew much wor&s;e, and on the third, the phy&s;icians pronounced her di&s;order to be a miliary fever. She is now, thank Heaven! out of danger, but weak, low, and in her bed. I did not know how truly, how fondly, I loved her, Lucan! till now&mdash;I am not a&s;hamed of the blot a tear has ju&s;t made.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="277">Her impatience to &s;et out for your country is unabated, but I fear it will be &s;ome time before her &s;trength will be equal to the journey. She has com|manded me to write a few lines, in <HI>gay|et&eacute; de coeur,</HI> to lady Barton, as if jealous of the corre&s;pondence between them, and &s;aying that I will only allow her to an&s;wer her letters, in per&s;on&mdash;This is meant to excu&s;e her &s;ilence, without alarming her about her illne&s;s&mdash;How tender, how con&s;iderate!</P>
<P>I hope to &s;ee you &s;oon in Dublin, and that we &s;hall return to England to|gether; if Lady Barton &s;hould come with us, we &s;hall be a good melange enough for a <HI>parte quarr&eacute;</HI>&mdash;I am re&s;olved to be gay; my wife will, I hope, be chearful, when &s;he has re&s;cued her &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="274" REF="278">
from the green-eyed mon&s;ter&mdash;You will be polite, and agreeable, at lea&s;t; and I think lady Barton will have no great cau&s;e to be &s;orrowful at leaving a hu&s;|band, with whom &s;he has never been happy, as Fanny has now confe&s;&s;ed to me, on this occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>IT is over, my dear &s;i&s;ter! my trial and condemnation are pa&s;t, and I now &s;ink under the weight of his cen&s;ure, from
<PB N="275" REF="279">
which I neither ought, nor de&s;ire to ap|peal&mdash;Ye&s;terday Sir William de&s;ired to &s;ee me; I in&s;tantly obeyed his &s;ummons, and approached him pale and trem|bling&mdash;But my wanne&s;s was the effect of ill health, and my tremor aro&s;e from weakne&s;s&mdash;Yet he perhaps might have attributed the&s;e &s;ymptoms to guilt, or fear; for a per&s;on arraigned, is generally half condemned.</P>
<P>I dreaded his flying into a rage at &s;eeing me, but, to do him ju&s;tice, he was unu&s;ually calm&mdash;As I entered the cham|ber, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry, Madam, that we &s;hould meet thus"</Q>&mdash;I told him I was &s;incerely grieved for having been the innocent cau&s;e of &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to him&mdash;He repeated the word <HI>innocent,</HI> and then launched out into the mo&s;t cruel,
<PB N="276" REF="280">
and I am happy to &s;ay, fal&s;e accu&s;ation, that ever was uttered.</P>
<P>Wretched! wretched man! my heart this moment feels for what his mu&s;t one day &s;uffer! He was violently agitated, while he proceeded in his accu&s;ation; and I &s;ometimes thought that he appeared to doubt the improbabilities he uttered, till he produced lord Lucan's picture, which &s;eemed like a vi&s;ible miracle to corroborate the whole legend.</P>
<P>I offered not the lea&s;t interruption, while he &s;poke; but when he had ended, I threw my&s;elf upon my knees before him, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner a&s;&s;ured him, that I had never been guilty of an act of di&s;honour, though I con|fe&s;&s;ed that my affections had not been in|violably
<PB N="277" REF="281">
re&s;trained to him; perhaps from the har&s;hne&s;s of his manners, perhaps from my own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>He was variou&s;ly affected whil&s;t I &s;poke, and often broke out into extrava|gant exclamations, denying the truth of what I &s;aid, by recurring to the charge again&s;t me&mdash;At other times he appeared &s;oftened, for an in&s;tant; but then the picture, like Othello's handkerchief, &s;till turned his heart to &s;tone.</P>
<P>Why was I not at liberty to unravel that my&s;tery? But my word was long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed to keep it &s;ecret, and never &s;hall that bond be forfeited; nor &s;hall my innocence ever be ju&s;tified by di&s;ho|nour. Be&s;ides, this was but a circum|&s;tance, and that equivocal, at mo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="282">He then &s;aid, that as my family, all but my&s;elf, were truly re&s;pectable, he would, for their &s;akes, take &s;ome time to con&s;ider how he &s;hould act, before he branded me with infamy; and that I might remain a pri&s;oner in his hou&s;e, till he had determined on my &s;entence&mdash;But from that moment interdicted me from quitting my apartment; and, what was &s;till much more &s;evere, from &s;eeing or conver&s;ing with my &s;ole comfort, the tender, the affectionate, the amiable Harriet.</P>
<P>I wept, but it was in &s;ilence, and yielded to this hard decree without a murmur&mdash;He might have been more cruel to me&mdash;Ben&s;on is &s;till permitted to attend me; nor has he yet forbidden me the melancholy plea&s;ure of writing to my

&s;i&s;ter! I thank him, mo&s;t &s;incerely, for the&s;e two indulgencies, and mo&s;t de|voutly hope I &s;hall not want them long.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Hume,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t letter has brought about a fatal event. I &s;hall make no merit of letting you into a &s;ecret, which is now at an end for ever! Lady Barton was the charming woman, to whom my heart had dedicated my life. Her beau|ty, purity, and frankne&s;s, &s;ure never yet were equalled! My attentions and regards, I fear, were too much marked towards her, for it &s;eems they were ta|ken notice of by a gentleman, Colonel Walter, who likewi&s;e vi&s;ited at her hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="302">This happened unfortunately to excite &s;ome jealou&s;y in his brea&s;t. Though how was it po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a being as her to in&s;pire a love without honour! He gave hints of his &s;u&s;picion, though they then appeared to be of no con&s;e|quence; but upon reading your letter, my mind quickly referred to the per&s;ons in que&s;tion, though you neither men|tioned his name, or mine.</P>
<P>I was &s;hocked at the fal&s;hood and vil|lainy of the &s;tory&mdash;Had Lady Barton been an object of the utmo&s;t indifference to me, honour and humanity mu&s;t have excited me to exculpate both her and my&s;elf, from &s;o vile a &s;lander&mdash;But, adoring her as I do! mere ju&s;tice was too lukewarm a principle of action&mdash;I added re&s;entment to it.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="303">I &s;et out immediately for his hou&s;e, and charged him with his perfidy&mdash;He denied it at fir&s;t, but when I had pro|duced my voucher, he attempted to ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that as the la|dy had her&s;elf acknowledged a pa&s;&s;ion for me, to him, it required no great reach of philo&s;ophy to deduce the na|tural conclu&s;ion he had drawn from &s;uch premi&s;es."</Q></P>
