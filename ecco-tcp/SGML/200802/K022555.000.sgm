<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform the Reader, who has not &s;een the following Sketch repre&s;ented on the Stage, that the character of <HI>Apewell</HI> is meant merely as a vehicle for Mr. Caulfield's <HI>Imitations:</HI> with which both the Mimick, and the Author of the Piece, are con|vinced, the re&s;pectable per&s;ons imitated, have too much good &s;en&s;e to be offended. They are given as <HI>Portraits,</HI> not as <HI>Caricatures;</HI> and the Publick has pronounced them to be &s;trong, but unexaggerated likene&s;&s;es of originals, whom its di&s;cernment has long patroni&s;ed and admired.</P>
<P>Although the Author has been a litte free with his good friends the Winter Managers, (who are a little free with his Sea&s;on) he thinks it needle&s;s to offer any apology to them. He is upon too good a footing with them to &s;uppo&s;e that they expect it. Friends and neigh|bours may joke with each other. <Q>Tap for tap, and &s;o part fair.</Q></P>

<P>Fifteen years &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;melt the lamp, Sir. My father was an eminent Button-maker, at Bir|mingham; and meant to marry me to Mi&s;s Molly Metre, daughter to the rich Director of the Coal-works, at Wolverhampton: but I had a &s;oul above buttons, and abhorred the idea of a mer|cenary marriage. I panted for a liberal profe&s;&s;ion &mdash;&s;o ran away from my father, and engaged with a travelling company of Comedians. In my travels, I had &s;oon the happine&s;s of forming a romantick attachment with the pre&s;ent Mrs. Daggerwood&mdash; wife to Sylve&s;ter Daggerwood, your humble &s;er|vant to command, who&s;e benefit is fixed for the eleventh of June, by the particular de&s;ire of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. So, you &s;ee, Sir, I have a ta&s;te.</P>

<P>The title, I think will &s;trike. The fa&s;hion of Plays, you know, now, is to do away old preju|dices; and to re&s;cue certain characters from the illiberal odium with which cu&s;tom has mark'd them. Thus we have a generous I&s;raelite, an amiable Cynick, and &s;o on. Now, Sir, I call my play&mdash;<HI>The Humane Footpad.</HI></P>
