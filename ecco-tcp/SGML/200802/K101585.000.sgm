<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many writers of our nation, who have by their talents contributed to entertain, inform, or improve our minds, no one has &s;o happily or univer&s;ally &s;ucceeded, as he whom we may ju&s;tly &s;tile our fir&s;t, our greate&s;t Poet, Shake&s;peare. For more than a century and a half, this Author has been the delight of the Ingenious, the text of the Mo|rali&s;t, and the &s;tudy of the Philo&s;opher. Even his cotemporary writers have ingenuou&s;ly yielded their plaudit to his fame, as not pre&s;uming it could le&s;&s;en theirs, &s;et at &s;o great a di&s;tance. Such &s;uperior excellence could never be brought into a comparative light; and jealou&s;y is dumb, when competition mu&s;t be vain. For him, then, they chearfully twined the laurel-wreath, and unrepining placed it on his brow; where it will ever bloom, while &s;en&s;e, ta&s;te, and natural feelings of the heart, &s;hall remain among&s;t the characteri&s;tics of this, or any other nation, that can be able to con&s;true his language. He is a Cla&s;&s;ic, and cotemporary with all ages.</P>
<Q><L>True Nature's Drama repre&s;ents all time;</L>
<L>Though old the la&s;t, the fir&s;t retains its prime.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">But amid&s;t all this bur&s;t of applau&s;e, one &s;ingle di&s;cordant voice is faintly heard. Voltaire has &s;tood forth his opponent. One might imagine &s;uch a writer to have had ta&s;te enough to reli&s;h his <HI>poetical beauties,</HI> at lea&s;t, tho' po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome doubt might ari&s;e about his &s;ympathy with his <HI>moral ones.</HI> But he unfairly tries him by Pe|dant laws, which our Author either did not know, or regarded not. His compo&s;itions are a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of the Drama; and not being an imitation of the Greek one, cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have infringed its rules. Shake&s;peare is a <HI>model,</HI> not a <HI>copy</HI>; he looked into nature, not in|to books, both for men and works. 'Tis learned ignorance, therefore, to quote the antient ex|emplars again&s;t him. Is there no &s;pring in&s;pired, but Aganippe's font? No raptured vi&s;ion, but on Parna&s;&s;us' mount? The Grecian Bards them|&s;elves had conceived a more liberal notion, in this particular, who, by making <HI>Phoebus</HI> the God of Poetry, &s;eem to have acknowledged in|&s;piration to be univer&s;al.</P>
<P>But as it may &s;hew more impartiality upon this &s;ubject, to oppo&s;e one French authority to another, I &s;hall here quote again&s;t M. Voltaire, the Abb&eacute; Le Blanc's opinion of our Author, in his <HI>Letters on the Engli&s;h Nation,</HI> written to his Friend.
<Q>He is, &s;ays he, of all Writers, an|tient or modern, the mo&s;t of an original. He is truly a great genius, and Nature has endowed him with powers to &s;hew it. His imagination is rich and &s;trong: he paints whatever he &s;ees, and embelli&s;hes whatever he de&s;cribes. The Loves in the train of Ve|nus are not repre&s;ented with more grace, in
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
the Pictures of Albanus, than this Poet gives to tho&s;e that attend on Cleopatra, in his de|&s;cription of the pomp with which that Queen pre&s;ents her&s;elf to Mark Antony, on the banks of the Cydnus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The reputation of this Author is &s;o great, that I &s;hall not be &s;urprized if you &s;u&s;pect me of exaggeration in this account of him. Tho&s;e of our nation who have ever men|tioned him, have been content to prai&s;e, <HI>with|out being capable of judging &s;ufficiently of his merits.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To the further honour of our Author be it &s;aid, that a Lady <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit has lately appeared a champion in his cau&s;e, again&s;t this <HI>minor critic,</HI> this <HI>minute philo&s;opher,</HI> this <HI>fly upon a pillar of St. Paul</HI>'s. It was her example which has &s;tirred up my emulation to this at|tempt; for I own that I am ambitious of the honour of appearing to think, at lea&s;t, though I de&s;pair of the &s;ucce&s;s of writing, like her.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope, in the Preface to his edition of this Author, &s;ays,
<Q>Of all the Engli&s;h Poets, Shake&s;peare mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be the faire&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;ubject for Critici&s;m, and to afford the mo&s;t numerous, as well as mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous, in&s;tances, both of beauties and blemi&s;hes, of all &s;orts.</Q>
And again:
<Q>I cannot, how|ever, but mention &s;ome of his principal and characteri&s;tic excellencies; for which, not|with&s;tanding his defects, he is ju&s;tly and de&s;ervedly elevated above all other Dra|matic Writers.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8">He might have added the following ob&s;er|vation, from Longinus, to his remarks, who &s;ays, that
<Q>In reading Homer, Plato, or any other of the great geniu&s;es of antiquity; whenever we happen to meet with pa&s;&s;ages which appear to be unintelligible or ab&s;urd, we ought fairly to conclude, that were they alive to explain them&s;elves in tho&s;e places, we &s;hould to our confu&s;ion be convinced, that the ignorance or error lay in our own conceptions alone.</Q>
Horace, too, may be re|ferred to upon this occa&s;ion, who indulgently &s;ays, that <HI>The blaze of fine writing gilds o'er its blots.</HI> Such was the candor, &s;uch the mode&s;ty, and &s;uch the deference, &s;hewn by Antient Com|mentators to the works of literature or genius. The brightne&s;s of the &s;un concealed its &s;pots from them; but &s;econd-hand critics, to &s;peak in the words of a modern Author, <HI>peer through a &s;moked gla&s;s to ob&s;erve them.</HI></P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Doctor John&s;on has given us a ju&s;t and beautiful &s;imile, on this &s;ubject:
<Q>The works of a correct and re|gular writer, &s;ays he, is a garden accurately formed, and diligently planted; varied with &s;hades, and &s;cented by flowers. The com|po&s;ition of Shake&s;peare is a fore&s;t, in which oaks extend their branches, and pines tower in the air, inter&s;per&s;ed &s;ometimes with weeds and brambles, and &s;ometimes affording &s;helter to myrtles and ro&s;es; filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endle&s;s diver&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t-mentioned Editor is the only one who has con&s;idered Shake&s;peare's writings in a
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
moral light; and therefore I confe&s;s my&s;elf of opinion that he has be&s;t under&s;tood them, by thus pointing to their highe&s;t merit, and noble&s;t excellence. And from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the Doctor's Preface, particularly where he &s;ays, that
<Q>From his writings, indeed, a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>&s;ocial duties</HI> may be &s;elected; for he who thinks rea&s;onably, mu&s;t think <HI>morally</HI>;</Q>
as well as from frequent reflections of my own, re&s;pecting the oeconomical conduct of life and manners, which have always ari&s;en in my mind on the peru&s;al of Shake&s;peare's works, I have ventured to a&s;&s;ume the ta&s;k of placing his Ethic merits in a more con&s;picuous point of view, than they have ever hitherto been pre|&s;ented in to the Public.</P>
<P>My difficulty will not be <HI>what to find,</HI> but <HI>what to chu&s;e,</HI> amid&s;t &s;uch a profu&s;ion of &s;weets, and variety of colours; nay, &s;ometimes, how to &s;eparate the moral from the matter, in this Author's writings; which are often &s;o con|texted, that, to continue Doctor John&s;on's allegory above quoted, they may be compared to an intermixture of the phy&s;ic with the kitchen garden, where both food and medi|cine may be culled from the &s;ame &s;pot.</P>
<P>Shake&s;peare is not only my Poet, but my Philo&s;opher al&s;o. His anatomy of the human heart is delineated from <HI>nature,</HI> not from <HI>me|taphy&s;ics</HI>; referring immediately to our intui|tive &s;en&s;e, and not wandering with the &s;chool|men, through the pathle&s;s wilds of theory. We not only <HI>&s;ee,</HI> but <HI>feel</HI> his di&s;&s;ections ju&s;t and &s;cientific.&mdash;The late ingenious Lord Lyttelton, &s;peaking of Sake&s;peare, &s;ays,
<Q>No author had
<PB N="x" REF="10">
ever &s;o copious, &s;o bold, &s;o creative an ima|gination, with &s;o perfect a knowledge of the pa&s;&s;ions, the humours, and &s;entiments of man|kind. He painted all characters, from heroes and kings, down to inn-keepers and pea&s;ants, with equal truth, and equal force. If human nature were quite de&s;troyed, and no monu|ment left of it, except his Works, other Beings might learn what man was, from tho&s;e writings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dialogues of the Dead.</NOTE>.</Q>
And Ben John&s;on had long before &s;aid of him:
<Q><L>Nature her&s;elf was proud of his de&s;igns,</L>
<L>And joyed to wear the dre&s;&s;ings of his lines.</L></Q></P>
<P>Shake&s;peare &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s that happy and peculiar kind of &s;uperiority over all other Dramatic Authors, that the ancient poets and hi&s;torians confe&s;&s;edly bear above the modern ones, with regard to the genuine characters, manners, and &s;entiments, of the per&s;ons exhibited in their re&s;pective writings. In the fir&s;t, we &s;ee the <HI>men of Nature</HI>; in the latter, but <HI>the children of the Schools.</HI></P>
<P>The world at pre&s;ent is held more in tram|mels, than it formerly was.&mdash;From our modes of education, policies, and breeding, our con|duct and demeanor are become more &s;ophi&s;ti|cate, our minds le&s;s candid, and our actions more di&s;gui&s;ed. Our modern literary painters repre&s;ent us &s;uch as we appear; but the genuine unadulterate heart can be moved by no affection, allied by no &s;ympathy, with &s;uch factitious per&s;onages, &s;uch puppets of polity, &s;uch automata of modern refinement. Hence, love, friend&s;hip, patrioti&s;m, are long &s;ince be|come
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
the ob&s;olete &s;entiments of chivalry and romance. But in all the repre&s;entations of Shake&s;peare, we are &s;en&s;ible of a connection; his whole Dramatis Per&s;onae &s;eem to be <HI>our acquaintance and countrymen</HI>; while in mo&s;t other exhibitions, they appear to be <HI>&s;trangers and foreigners.</HI> Doctor John&s;on, upon com|paring the Tragedy of Cato with one of our Author's plays, &s;ays ju&s;tly, that
<Q>Addi&s;on &s;peaks the language of <HI>Poets,</HI> but Shake|&s;peare that of <HI>Men.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>Of all the literary exercitations of &s;peculative men, whether de&s;igned for the u&s;e or entertainment of the world, there are none of &s;o much impor|tance, or what are more of our immediate concern, than tho&s;e which let us into a knowledge of our nature. Others may exer|ci&s;e the rea&s;on, or amu&s;e the imagination; but the&s;e only can improve the heart, and form the mind to wi&s;dom. Now, in this &s;cience our Shake&s;peare is confe&s;&s;ed to oc|cupy the foremo&s;t place; whether we con|&s;ider the amazing &s;agacity with which he inve&s;tigates every hidden &s;pring and wheel of human action; or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge, in the ju&s;t and lively paintings which he has given us of all our pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, and pur&s;uits. The&s;e afford a le&s;&s;on, which can never be too often repeated, or too &s;trongly incul|cated.</Q></P>
<P>Shaft&s;bury, though &s;evere, I think rather too much &s;o, again&s;t Shake&s;peare's faults, al|lows, that
<Q>By the ju&s;tne&s;s of his moral, the
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
aptne&s;s of his de&s;criptions, and the plain and natural turn of &s;everal of his characters, he plea&s;es his audience, and gains their ear, <HI>without a &s;ingle bribe from luxury or vice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Author's poetical beauties have been already &s;elected, though they needed it not, as they are undoubtedly &s;o &s;triking as &s;carcely to require the being particularly pointed out to any Reader capable of conceiving or reli&s;hing them; but a &s;ingle line, &s;ometimes a word, in many in&s;tances throughout his Works, may convey a hint, or impre&s;s a &s;entiment upon the heart, if properly marked, which might po&s;|&s;ibly be overlooked, while curio&s;ity is attend|ing to the fable, or the imagination tran&s;ported with the &s;plendor of diction, or &s;ublimity of images.</P>
<P>There is a Moral &s;ometimes couched in his Fable, which whenever I have been able to di&s;cover, I have pointed out to the Reader; and from tho&s;e pieces where this excellence is deficient in the Argument, as particularly in his Hi&s;torical Plays, where poetical ju&s;tice cannot always obtain, human life not being the whole of our exi&s;tence, I have given his moral and in&s;truction in detail, by quoting the pa&s;&s;ages as they happen to lie detached, or referring to the &s;cope and tenor of the dialogue.</P>
<P>In the&s;e remarks and ob&s;ervations I have not re&s;tricted my&s;elf to morals purely ethic, but have extended my ob&s;ervations and reflections to whatever has reference to the general oeco|nomy of life and manners, re&s;pecting prudence, polity, decency, and decorum; or relative to the
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
tender affections and fond endearments of hu|man nature; more e&s;pecially regarding tho&s;e moral duties which are the true&s;t &s;ource of mortal bli&s;s&mdash;dome&s;tic ties, offices, and obliga|tions.</P>
<P>This code of morality has an advantage over any other of the kind, on account of its not being conducted &s;y&s;tematically. In all books that treat upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, the precepts are di&s;po&s;ed methodically, under &s;eparate heads or chapters; as Ambition, Bravery, Con&s;tancy, De|votion, and &s;o on to the end of the alphabet; which mode, though u&s;eful on account of re|ferences, or as a common-place book, cannot be near &s;o entertaining, and con&s;equently &s;o well able to an&s;wer the <HI>utile dulci,</HI> as a work of this &s;ort, where the documents ri&s;e out of the action immediately before our eyes, and are con&s;tantly varying with the quick &s;hifting of &s;cenes, per|&s;on, and &s;ubjects; where love &s;ometimes fol|lows war, jealou&s;y &s;ucceeds friend&s;hip, par&s;i|mony liberality; and &s;o proceeding throughout the intire <HI>quicquid agunt homines</HI> of human life.</P>

<HEAD>THE MORALITY OF SHAKESPEARE's DRAMA ILLUSTRATED.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The TEMPEST.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Play, and the Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream, which in all the latter editions immediately follows it, are con&s;idered by Dr. Warburton,
<Q>as the noble&s;t effort of that &s;ub|lime and amazing imagination, peculiar to Shake|&s;peare, which &s;oars above the bounds of Nature, without for&s;aking Sen&s;e; or, more properly, car|ries Nature along with it, beyond her terre&s;trial limits.</Q></P>
<P>He has, indeed, in both the&s;e exhibitions, created Beings out of all vi&s;ible exi&s;tence; or, as he has him|&s;elf mo&s;t beautifully expre&s;&s;ed it,
<Q><L>Given to airy Nothing</L>
<L>A local habitation, and a name.</L></Q>
Yet by the powers of his genius has he contrived to make the&s;e chimeras of his brain think, act, and &s;peak, in a manner which appears &s;o &s;uited to the anomalous per&s;onages his magic has conjured up, that
<PB N="2" REF="18">
we readily adopt them into the &s;cale of Nature, from a pre&s;umption, that were they really to exi&s;t, they would probably re&s;emble the characters which his wand has endowed them with.</P>
<P>The&s;e two plays are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the fir&s;t and &s;econd of his writing; though I believe there are no dates remaining, to confirm this opinion; which can therefore be founded only on the idea, that his youthful imagination mu&s;t naturally be thought to have been more &s;portive and exuberant, than his riper judgment might have permitted the indulgence of. And here, indeed,
<Q><L>She wantons, as in her prime,</L>
<L>And plays at will her virgin fancies:</L></Q>
though, if I may be allowed the liberty of a criti|ci&s;m about this matter, I &s;hould be rather inclined to &s;uppo&s;e this Play to have been one of his latter performances, as all the <HI>unities</HI> are &s;o &s;trictly pre|&s;erved in it.</P>
<P>But though both the&s;e pieces po&s;&s;e&s;s all the <HI>le&s;&s;er merits</HI> of poe&s;y, they are not &s;o much &s;uited to the pur|po&s;e of my pre&s;ent undertaking, e&s;pecially the &s;econd, as &s;everal others of the &s;ame author; for the mo&s;t material events, in both, being principally conducted by <HI>machinery,</HI> or &s;upernatural agency, produce rather a&s;toni&s;hment than reflection: &s;o that unle&s;s we adopt Dr. John&s;on's remark, in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the Tem|pe&s;t,
<Q>it may be ob&s;erved of Gonzalo, that being the only good man that appears with the King, he is the only one who pre&s;erves his chearfulne&s;s in the wreck, or his hope on the i&s;land,</Q>
there is not &s;o much to be collected from them, as I could wi&s;h, to be placed to the &s;core of Morality. However, all that can be extracted from either, referrible to this head, &s;hall be diligently pointed out to the reader. With this view I &s;hall lay the Fable of this Play before my reader, for the &s;ake of the Moral, which may be &s;o fairly deduced from it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19">Pro&s;pero, a duke of Milan, having been ex|pelled his dominion, by the u&s;urpation of his brother Anthonio, confederated with Alonzo, a king of Na|ples, is committed to the mercy of the winds and waves, in a rotten bark, accompanied only by his daughter, Miranda, a child of three years old; but has had the good fortune to e&s;cape, and be landed on an uninhabited i&s;land; where the fir&s;t &s;cene is laid, and the intire action continued, during the whole repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>About twelve years after this event, Anthonio, with Alonzo, Ferdinand his &s;on, and other attendants, being on a voyage together, are driven out of their cour&s;e, by a &s;torm, and wrecked upon this i&s;land, but e&s;cape alive on &s;hore; where the Prince, meeting with Miranda, falls in love with her, and a reci|procal pa&s;&s;ion is conceived on her part, al&s;o.</P>
<P>Pro&s;pero, having thus got his enemies within his power, on their repentance, generou&s;ly forgives them their cruelty and inju&s;tice, recovers his dukedom again, and the marriage of the lovers confirms an alliance on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort &s;tory I think the following <HI>general Moral</HI> will naturally re&s;ult: That the ways, the ju&s;tice, and the goodne&s;s of Providence, are &s;o frequently manife&s;ted towards mankind, even in this life, that it &s;hould ever encourage an hone&s;t and a guiltle&s;s mind to form hopes, in the mo&s;t forlorn &s;ituations; and ought al&s;o to warn the wicked never to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured in the fal&s;e confidence of wealth or power, again&s;t the natural abhorrence of vice, both in God and man.</P>
<P>Many of the unfore&s;een events of life, which ap|pear to us but accident or contingency, may po&s;&s;ibly be parts of the &s;ecret workings of Provi|dence,
<Q>All chance direction which we cannot &s;ee;</Q>
and have oftener been remarked rather as cha&s;ti&s;e|ments of vice, than as reliefs from mi&s;ery. We are
<PB N="4" REF="20">
&s;en&s;ible in our own nature, of a &s;tronger impul&s;e to re&s;ent the fir&s;t, than even to commi&s;erate the latter. How much higher, then, mu&s;t this &s;entiment ri&s;e, in the Author of that very nature! In wretchedne&s;s there is no contagion, 'tis but particular and tempo|rary: the effects of vice are general and eternal.</P>

<Q><L>O! I have &s;uffered</L>

<P><PB N="5" REF="21">There is &s;omething in the fond expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>good &s;hip,</HI> in the la&s;t line but one, which &s;trikes me with an idea of a peculiar tenderne&s;s in her compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>Pro&s;pero, confe&s;&s;ing the mad folly of tru&s;ting his reins of admini&s;tration into other hands, &s;ays,
<Q><L>The Government I ca&s;t upon my brother,</L>
<L><HI>And to my State grew &s;tranger.</HI></L></Q>
And again, &s;peaking of the &s;ame per&s;on,
<Q><L>Being once perfected how to grant &s;uits,</L>
<L>How to deny them; whom to advance, and whom</L>
<L>To tra&s;h for over-topping; new created</L>

<L>Or el&s;e new formed them; having both the key</L>
<L>Of officer and office, &s;et all things in the &s;tate</L>
<L>To what tune plea&s;ed his ear; <HI>that now he was</HI></L>
<L><HI>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And &s;ucked my verdure out on't.</HI></L></Q>
In continuation,
<Q><L>And my tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Like a good parent, did beget of him</L>
<L>A fal&s;ehood in its contrary as great</L>
<L>As my tru&s;t was; which had, indeed, no limit:</L>
<L>A confidence <HI>&s;ans</HI> bound. He being thus lorded,</L>
<L>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</L>
<L>But what my power might el&s;e exact; like one,</L>
<L>Who having, unto truth, by telling oft,</L>
<L>Made &s;uch a &s;inner of his memory,</L>
<L>To credit his own lie, he did believe</L>
<L>He was, indeed, the Duke; from &s;ub&s;titution,</L>
<L>And executing the outward face of Royalty,</L>
<L>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing,</L>
<L>To have no &s;creen between the part he played,</L>
<L>And him he played it for, he needs will be</L>
<L>Ab&s;olute Milan.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this account of the Duke's weakne&s;s, with the natural con&s;equences attending it, the Poet has af|forded a proper le&s;&s;on to princes, never to render them&s;elves cyphers in their government, by too dan|gerous a confidence in their favourites; but ever to con&s;ider tho&s;e per&s;ons, to whom they depute the &s;e|veral offices of State, as <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> in the <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word, only, not in the <HI>political</HI> one.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="22">When Pro&s;pero de&s;cribes the hazards and difficul|ties of his forlorn voyage, Miranda tenderly ex|claims,
<Q><L>Alack! what trouble</L>
<L>Was I then to you?</L></Q>
To which he, in a kind of exta&s;y of fondne&s;s, re|plies,
<Q><L>O! a cherubim</L>
<L>Thou wa&s;t, that did pre&s;erve me. Thou did&s;t &s;mile,</L>
<L>Infu&s;ed with a fortitude from Heaven,</L>

<L>An undergoing &s;tomach, to bear up</L>
<L>Again&s;t what &s;hould en&s;ue.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here the Poet finely points to that virtue of true manhood, which &s;erves to &s;trengthen our fortitude and double our activity, when objects, whom the ties of Nature, or the &s;ympathy of affections, have en|deared to us, require our &s;olace or a&s;&s;i&s;tance in di&s;tre&s;s or danger.

<P>Here the too general di&s;&s;ipations of life are hinted at, and tho&s;e parents cen&s;ured, who transfer the pious duty of their children's education to merce|nary preceptors; except in the meaner articles of it, the arts, exerci&s;es, and &s;ciences. Too few attend to the higher and more intere&s;ting charge, of forming the mind and directing the heart to their proper objects; and fewer &s;till, in deputing it to others, &s;eem to regard the chief requi&s;ites, of character, or capacity, in tho&s;e they intru&s;t with this office, look|ing upon competent &s;cholar&s;hip to be alone &s;uffi|cient.</P>
<P>But a liberal education, as far as it extends in Col|leges and Schools, does not always give a liberal

<Q>Grow with our growth, and &s;trengthen with our &s;trength.</Q>
Tho&s;e only are capable of &s;inking into the heart, and imbuing the mind, while mere didactic maxims remain a load upon the memory alone. The fir&s;t only <HI>in&s;pire us how to act,</HI> the latter but <HI>in&s;truct us how to &s;peak.</HI></P>

This allu&s;ion, whether Shake&s;peare intended it or no, is &s;o obvious, that there would not require the

<P>Trinculo mo&s;t humourou&s;ly ridicules the pa&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h for &s;trange &s;ights, in the following re|flection, on &s;eeing Caliban lying a&s;leep on the ground, whom he takes for a dead &s;ea-mon&s;ter, ju&s;t ca&s;t a&s;hore by the working of the waves.
<Q>Were I in England, now, as once I was, and had but this fi&s;h painted, not a holy-day fool there but would give a piece of &s;ilver. There would this mon&s;ter <HI>make a man</HI>; any &s;trange bea&s;t there <HI>makes a man.</HI> When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to &s;ee a dead Indian.</Q>
<PB N="9" REF="25">
Not, however, that this foible can fairly be in|duced again&s;t us, as a national reflection, by any means; for it is not peculiar to this, or any other particular people, but will be found to be the com|mon di&s;po&s;ition and idle curio&s;ity of mankind, in general. There is another piece of &s;arca&s;m, al&s;o, thrown out, in the &s;ame &s;peech, as unju&s;t as the former: <HI>When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar.</HI> No nation on the globe is more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for charity, humanity, and benevolence, than the Engli&s;h are, at pre&s;ent. And this mu&s;t have been always their characteri&s;tic; for manners may refine, but cannot create, virtues. Poli&s;hing may give ta&s;te, but feelings come from nature.</P>
<P>After Trinculo has recovered from his fright, and finds Caliban to be but an harmle&s;s &s;avage, &s;o very &s;imple as to believe Stephano to be the Man in the Moon; he &s;ays,
<Q>By this good light, this is a very &s;hallow mon&s;ter&mdash;<HI>I afraid of him?</HI> a very &s;hallow mon&s;ter. The man i' th' Moon? a mo&s;t poor credulous mon&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erved, here, that he was not charged with having been afraid, nor did any one know of it, but him&s;elf; and it was this very con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that forced &s;uch a bravado from him. This is Doctor Warburton's remark. 'Tis a ju&s;t one, and may be rendered general, by ob&s;erving, that, upon all occa&s;ions, too prompt a defence of our&s;elves, is a &s;ort of &s;elf-accu&s;ation.</P>

<P>I Shall not trouble my readers with the Fable of this piece, as I can &s;ee no general moral that can be deduced from the Argument; nor, as I hinted before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to the Tempe&s;t, paragraph 4th.</NOTE>, is there much &s;entiment to be collected even from the Dialogue. But whatever harve&s;t can be gleaned from this unfruitful field, I &s;hall endea|vour to pick up, as becomes a faithful &s;teward of the farm.</P>

<Q><STAGE>The&s;eus <HI>to</HI> Hermia.</STAGE>
<L><HI>To you your father &s;hould be as a God,</HI></L>
<L>One that compo&s;ed your beauties; yea, and one</L>
<L>To whom you are but as a form in wax</L>
<L>By him imprinted; and within his power</L>
<L>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</L></Q>
<P>In this &s;peech, the pious notion of the Antients, with regard to this relation, while genuine Nature was their &s;ole Preceptor, is fully expre&s;&s;ed. Here the duty of children to their parents, is indeed car|ried to the height; and yet, methinks, not at all too far. They are the objects of our earlie&s;t affections, of our fir&s;t deference, of our primary obligations. Even &s;uper&s;tition, in this ca&s;e, as far at lea&s;t as im|plicit obedience extends, exceeds not true devotion.</P>
<P>The Decalogue was originally written on two ta|bles; five in each. The fir&s;t refers &s;olely to Reli|gion; the &s;econd, to Morality, only. To honour our parents, therefore, as falling within the former line of obligations, is, by this di&s;tinction, made one
<PB N="16" REF="32">
of our <HI>pious</HI> duties; as through them we honour the Creator, who ordained this relation between us. This precept, then, &s;hould &s;eem to have a double tie upon us, as partaking both of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morals</HI>; and there|fore, however the latter bond may chance to be cancelled, the fir&s;t ought never to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>In fine, there is &s;omething &s;o fond and endearing in the idea and exerci&s;e of a child's obedience and deference towards a parent, that how rotten mu&s;t the root be, or how blighted the branches, if &s;uch a tree &s;hould fail of producing its natural fruit!</P>
<P>Thus far, by way of general reflection, only; for I mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding, admit, that the particular in&s;tance of the daughter's compliance, exacted by the father, in this piece, of re&s;igning an hu&s;band of her own choice, <HI>upon equal terms,</HI> and accepting another, cho&s;en arbitrarily for her, <HI>by caprice merely,</HI> was too &s;evere a trial of obedience. Egeus here, like Abraham, would &s;acrifice his child at the altar, not only without the command of God, but contrary to his expre&s;s purpo&s;e, proclaimed aloud by the voice of Nature, and further confirmed from the deduc|tions of virtuous affection, free will, and rational election.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid that the duty of a child was <HI>natural,</HI> I did not mean to inve&s;t the parent with an authority which <HI>was not &s;o</HI>; and I cannot blame Hermia, therefore, upon the &s;evere laws of Athens being de|clared to her, for the cha&s;te and &s;pirited re&s;olution &s;he frames to her&s;elf on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<Q><L>So will I grow, &s;o live, &s;o die, my lord,</L>
<L>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</L>
<L>Unto his lord&s;hip; <HI>to who&s;e unwi&s;hed yoke</HI></L>

</SP></Q>
<P><PB N="18" REF="34">Hermia had u&s;ed no arts, no coquetry, to allure her lover from her; for, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es it, ju&s;t after, in the &s;ame dialogue,
<Q>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</Q>
She had, indeed, happened to have done her an <HI>injury,</HI> but <HI>no wrong</HI>; and therefore the for&s;aken maid &s;hews her ju&s;tice in plaining her own ill fortune, only, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t manner of re&s;ent|ment again&s;t her unoffending rival.</P>
<P>Hermia, in the &s;ame &s;cene, alludes to the magic power of love, which concenters all our ideas in one, making us prefer a cottage to a palace, and a de&s;ert to a grove, according to the &s;ituation or circum|&s;tances of the object of our affections. After having declared the purpo&s;e of flying her country with her lover, &s;he adds,
<Q><L>Before the time I did Ly&s;ander &s;ee,</L>
<L>Seemed Athens like a Paradi&s;e to me.</L>
<L>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</L>
<L>That he hath turned a heaven into hell?</L></Q></P>
<P>And Helena, afterwards, carries on the &s;ame idea, in the following lines:
<Q><L>Things ba&s;e and vile, holding no quantity,</L>
<L>Love can tran&s;po&s;e to form and dignity.</L>
<L>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</L>
<L>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind;</L>
<L>Nor hath love's mind of any judgment ta&s;te:</L>
<L>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy ha&s;te,</L>
<L>And therefore is love &s;aid to be a child,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e in choice he is &s;o oft beguiled.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;eus too, in a pa&s;&s;age of his &s;peech, in the fir&s;t Scene of the Fifth Act of this Play, accords with the above &s;entiment:
<Q><L>While the lover all as frantic</L>
<L>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.</L></Q></P>
<P>And Shake&s;peare has hinted a moral, on this latter &s;ubject, with regard to irregular or ill-placed affec|tion, as Dr. Warburton has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved,
<Q>by as fine a metamorpho&s;is as any in Ovid,</Q>
in the la&s;t line of the following &s;peech, in the &s;econd Scene
<PB N="19" REF="35">
of Act the Second; the whole of which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe here, in order to &s;hew how ju&s;tly and poetically he has pointed to the different effects of pa&s;&s;ion upon bu&s;y and contemplative minds, as well as on idle and di&s;&s;ipated ones.</P>

<P>Mr. Warton imagines this pa&s;&s;age to have alluded to a poem of Spen&s;er's, &s;tiled <HI>The Tears of the Mu&s;es, on the Neglect and Contempt of Learning,</HI> in his time.

<HEAD>THE Two Gentlemen of Verona.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fable of this Play has no more moral in it, than the former, nor does it make us much amends, either by the number, or variety of its documents. I would, therefore, have pa&s;&s;ed it by, as &s;ome of the editors have done, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition of its not being one of Shake&s;peare's; but that I thought any thing which had ever been imputed to that author, had a right to claim a place in this Work; unle&s;s the rejection of it were e&s;tabli&s;hed upon better grounds, than the diver&s;ity of opinions about its authenticity, among the Commentators.</P>
<P>And, indeed, were I to offer any doubt upon this point, my&s;elf, it &s;hould not be &s;o much from the objections adduced by the editors, as on account of the unnatural incon&s;i&s;tency of character, in the per&s;on of Protheus; who, in the fir&s;t Act, and during above half the &s;econd, appears to &s;tand in the mo&s;t amiable and virtuous lights, both of morals and manhood, as a fond lover, and a faithful friend; and yet &s;uddenly belies his fair &s;eemings, by an infidelity toward the fir&s;t object, and a treachery with regard to the &s;econd. 'Tis true, indeed, that in the latter end he expre&s;&s;es a &s;ort of contrition for his crimes; but yet this &s;till &s;eems to remain equivocal; as it does not appear to have ari&s;en from any remor&s;e of con&s;cience, or abhorrence of his ba&s;ene&s;s, but rather from a di&s;appointment in his pur&s;uit, and an open detection of his villainy.</P>
<P>There are but few in&s;tances of this kind, that I remember to have met with, throughout the drama of Shake&s;peare; for however he may &s;port, as he often does, with the three <HI>unities</HI> of Ari&s;totle, <HI>time,
<PB N="26" REF="41">
place,</HI> and <HI>action,</HI> he &s;eldom &s;ins again&s;t a fourth, which I am &s;urpri&s;ed the Critics have not added, as being worth them all&mdash;namely, that of <HI>character</HI>; the tenor of which is generally pre&s;erved, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, in all his works. This con&s;i&s;tency is re|quired in the epic, and why not in&s;i&s;ted on in the dramatic poem, I cannot conceive.</P>
<P>I am venturing, I own, beyond my purpo&s;e; but I am tempted here, upon mentioning his breach of the unities, to ob&s;erve, that the Commentators do our author great inju&s;tice, to examine him by the cold rules of artful con&s;truction. Shake&s;peare's writ|ings re&s;emble the antient mu&s;ic, which con&s;i&s;ted in <HI>melody</HI> alone, without regard to <HI>harmony,</HI> which is a &s;cience of much later invention; and it has been remarked, that the original airs of every country, which charm a natural ear mo&s;t, have been tho&s;e that give offence to <HI>modern compo&s;ers,</HI> by an utter neglect of the <HI>counter-point.</HI> The compo&s;itions of our Bard have the &s;ame beauty, with the &s;ame defect. He ought, therefore, never to be con&s;idered but under the de&s;cription which Milton has given of him;
<Q><L>Our &s;weete&s;t Shake&s;peare, Fancy's child,</L>
<L>Warbling his native wood-notes wild.</L></Q>
Would they re&s;train him within the precincts of art, the height, the depth of who&s;e imagination and creative genius found even the extent of Nature too &s;treightly bounded for it to move in?</P>
<Q>Exhau&s;ted worlds, and then imagined new.</Q>
<P>Like an ea&s;tern monarch, his word was law, his will and plea&s;ure edicts and decrees. But there are certain <HI>mechani&s;ts</HI> in critici&s;m, who have no other way of judging, but by applying the <HI>rule</HI> and <HI>compa&s;s</HI>; like antient gardeners, who trimmed their fore&s;t-trees into cones and cylinders, and reduced winding brooks to &s;quare canals. A man mu&s;t be <HI>born</HI> a critic, as well as a poet; but, at this rate, he may be <HI>bred</HI> both.</P>

And it is this circum&s;tance which has induced the critics to &s;u&s;pect this Play not to have been originally one of Shake&s;peare's, but only re|vi&s;ed and enriched with fragments, by him; as it may be deemed to be not <HI>a jewel,</HI> but only <HI>a lump of pa&s;te,</HI> &s;et round <HI>with &s;parks.</HI></P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Valentine.</SPEAKER>
<L>Cea&s;e to per&s;uade, my loving Protheus;</L>
<L>Home-keeping youth <HI>have ever</HI> homely wits&mdash;</L>
<L>Were't not affection chains thy tender days</L>
<L>To the &s;weet glances of thy honoured love,</L>
<L>I rather would intreat thy company</L>
<L>To &s;ee the wonders of the world abroad,</L>
<L>Than (living <HI>dully &s;luggaraized,</HI> at home)</L>
<L>Wear out thy youth in <HI>&s;hapele&s;s idlene&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forming neither manners, nor character.</NOTE>.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The tenderne&s;s and &s;olicitudes of friend&s;hip are well and fondly expre&s;&s;ed in the reply:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Protheus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu;&mdash;</L>
<L>Think on thy Protheus, when thou haply &s;ee&s;t</L>
<L>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel&mdash;</L>
<L>Wi&s;h me partaker in thy happine&s;s,</L>
<L>When thou do&s;t meet good hap; and in thy danger,</L>
<L><HI>If ever danger do environ thee,</HI></L>
<L>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayer;</L>
<L>For I will be thy bead's-man, Valentine.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><HI>If ever danger do environ thee</HI>&mdash;This line &s;trikes me with a peculiar beauty. Protheus de&s;ires to be con|&s;idered as a &s;harer in his friend's weal or woe, during ab&s;ence; the fir&s;t he mentions without any re&s;erve,
<Q><L>Wi&s;h me partaker in thy happine&s;s,</L>
<L>When thou do&s;t meet good hap&mdash;</L></Q>
But when he comes to &s;peak of the latter, he ap|pears to catch him&s;elf up, as if alarmed even at the idea of his danger, and &s;eems to have begun his prayers for him, already.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="43">But not to quit the fir&s;t &s;ubject hinted above, only to re-a&s;&s;ume it again, I &s;hall introduce a &s;peech from the fourth Scene following, though &s;omewhat out of its place, here; where Panthion, &s;peaking to the father of Protheus, tells him the opinion of another per&s;on about him and his &s;on.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Panthion.</SPEAKER>
<L>He wondered that your lord&s;hip</L>
<L>Would &s;uffer him to &s;pend his life at home,</L>

<L>Put forth their &s;ons to &s;eek preferment out;</L>
<L>Some to the wars, to try their fortunes there;</L>
<L>Some to di&s;cover i&s;lands far away:</L>
<L>Some to the &s;tudious Univer&s;ities.</L>
<L>For any, or for all the&s;e exerci&s;es,</L>
<L>He &s;aid that Protheus, your &s;on, was meet;</L>
<L>And did reque&s;t me to importune you</L>
<L>To let him &s;pend his time no more at home;</L>
<L>Which would be great impeachment to his age,</L>
<L>In having known no travel in his youth.</L>

<L>Nor need'&s;t thou much importune me to that,</L>
<L>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</L>
<L>I have con&s;idered well his lo&s;s of time,</L>
<L><HI>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</HI></L>

<P>But to return to the fir&s;t Scene, again. In this and many of the &s;ub&s;equent ones, the &s;everal parts of which &s;hall be quoted as they follow in order, to prevent the interruption of the &s;ubject, our Author has truly de&s;cribed the nature, the effects, the anxieties, the weakne&s;&s;es, the extravagancies, and the mi&s;eries, of the pa&s;&s;ion of love, mo&s;t philo&s;o|phically, poetically, and experimentally.</P>
<P>Valentine, per&s;uading Protheus to quit his mi&s;|tre&s;s, and accompany him on his travels, &s;ays:
<Q><L>To be in love, where &s;corn is bought with groans;</L>
<L>Coy looks with heart-&s;ore &s;ighs; one fading moment's mirth</L>
<L>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights&mdash;</L>
<L>If haply won, perhaps an haple&s;s gain;</L>
<L>If lo&s;t, why then a grievous labour won;</L>

<P>Valentine, after his falling in love, to Protheus:
<Q><SP>
<L>I have done penance for contemning love;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e high imperious thoughts have puni&s;hed me</L>
<L>With bitter fa&s;ts, with penitential groans;</L>
<L>With nightly tears, and daily heart-&s;ore &s;ighs&mdash;</L>
<L>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</L>
<L>Love hath chaced &s;leep from my enthralled eyes,</L>
<L>And made them watchers of my own heart's &s;orrow.</L>
<L>O, gentle Protheus, love's a mighty lord,</L>
<L>And hath &s;o humbled me, as I confe&s;s</L>
<L>There is no woe to his correction;</L>
<L>Nor to his &s;ervice, no &s;uch joy on earth.</L>
<L>Now no di&s;cour&s;e, except it be of love;</L>
<L>Now can I break my fa&s;t, dine, &s;up, and &s;leep,</L>

of man. Second nature is more than a match even for the fir&s;t. In this philo&s;ophy lie the manife&s;t and manifold advantages of a good education, which alone forms the different manners allotted to the &s;exes, rendering men brave, and pre&s;erving women cha&s;te.

<P>The Duke, remaining &s;till under the di&s;gui&s;e of a friar, comes to the pri&s;on to prepare Claudio for death; upon which &s;ubject he makes a number of moral and philo&s;ophic reflections; but the&s;e la&s;t mo&s;tly of the Stoic kind, by ob&s;erving on the precariou&s;|ne&s;s and in&s;ignificancy of human life; the whole of which I &s;hall give here at full length.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Duke <HI>to</HI> Claudio.</STAGE>
<L>Be ab&s;olute for death; or death, or life,</L>
<L>Shall thereby be the &s;weeter. Rea&s;on thus with life;</L>

<P>And in the next &s;cene, I&s;abella, after hinting to her brother at certain ba&s;e conditions, on which his &s;entence might be remitted, endeavours to &s;trengthen his re&s;olution to prefer death before di&s;honour, by &s;omewhat of the &s;ame manner of rea&s;oning, as above; but more conclu&s;ive and conci&s;e:
<Q><L>Oh, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,</L>
<L>Le&s;t thou a feveri&s;h life &s;hould'&s;t entertain,</L>

<L><PB N="46" REF="61">The &s;en&s;e of death is mo&s;t in apprehen&s;ion;</L>

<P>To this &s;u&s;picion of his weakne&s;s he replies, with the &s;pirit becoming a man of honour and vir|tue:

<P>In the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age of this Scene, the Duke repeats the &s;ame reflection, in &s;till &s;tronger terms:
<Q><L>O place and greatne&s;s! Millions of fal&s;e eyes</L>

<P>Such has been the complaint of all ages, even when the &s;candal was merely <HI>oral</HI>; but how much more intolerable has the offence become, of late years, when obloquy is not only privately &s;poken, but pub|licly printed, and openly circulated throughout the&s;e kingdoms?

<P>The forebodings or pre&s;entiments of evil, natural to the human mind, are &s;trongly pointed at here. It were in vain to attempt the inve&s;tigation of this mat|ter from philo&s;ophy, any more than that of prophetic dreams; &s;o that all we have to do, is &s;imply to ac|quie&s;ce in the fact it&s;elf, which repeated experience has &s;ufficiently vouched in too many remarkable in|&s;tances, to be imputed to common ca&s;ualty.</P>

<L>In &s;ooth, I know not why I am &s;o &s;ad;</L>
<L>It wearies me; you &s;ay it wearies you;</L>

<L>I am to learn.&mdash;</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Upon which his two friends attempt to account for this impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, in a very natural manner&mdash;as,
<Q>Where a man's trea&s;ure is, there will his heart be al&s;o.</Q></P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Salanio.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your mind is to&s;&s;ing on the ocean;</L>
<L>There where your <HI>Argofies</HI> with portly &s;ail,</L>
<L>Like Signiors and rich Burghers on the flood,</L>

<L>Do over-peer the petty traffickers,</L>
<L>That curt&s;ie to them, do them reverence,</L>
<L>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solarino.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, Sir, had I &s;uch venture forth,</L>
<L>The better part of my affections would</L>
<L>Be with my hopes abroad. I &s;hould be &s;till</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="67">Plucking the gra&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To throw up into the air.</NOTE>, to know where &s;its the wind;</L>
<L>Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;</L>

<L>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,</L>
<L>Would make me &s;ad.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Salanio.</SPEAKER>
<L>My wind, cooling my broth,</L>
<L>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</L>
<L>What harm a wind too great might do at &s;ea.</L>
<L>I &s;hould not &s;ee the &s;andy hour-gla&s;s run,</L>
<L>But I &s;hould think of &s;hallows and of flats,</L>
<L>And &s;ee my wealthy <HI>Andrew</HI> docked in &s;and,</L>
<L>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs,</L>
<L>To ki&s;s her burial. Should I go to church,</L>
<L>And &s;ee the holy edifice of &s;tone,</L>
<L>And not bethink me &s;trait of dangerous rocks?</L>
<L>Which touching but my gentle ve&s;&s;el's &s;ide,</L>
<L>Would &s;catter all the &s;pices on the &s;tream,</L>
<L>Enrobe the roaring waters with my &s;ilks;</L>
<L>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</L>
<L>And now worth nothing. Shall I have the thought</L>
<L>To think on this, and &s;hall I lack the thought,</L>
<L>That &s;uch a thing bechanced would make me &s;ad?</L>
<L>But tell not me&mdash;I know Anthonio</L>
<L>Is &s;ad to think upon his merchandize.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>But when he denies that any reflection upon the &s;tate of his fortune, or that even the pa&s;&s;ion of love, has wrought this grave effect upon his &s;pirits, they then remain quite at a lo&s;s to account farther for it, referring it merely to the peculiarity of his charac|ter, or particular complexion of mind; which is de&s;cribed and contra&s;ted with one of an oppo&s;ite ca&s;t, with admirable humour:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Solarino.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not in love, neither! Then let's &s;ay, you're &s;ad,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e you are not merry; and 'twere as ea&s;y</L>
<L>For you to laugh and leap, and &s;ay you're merry,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e you are not &s;ad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</L>
<L>Nature hath framed &s;trange fellows, in her time;</L>
<L>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</L>
<L>And laugh, like parrots, at a bag piper;</L>
<L>And others of &s;uch vinegar a&s;pect,</L>
<L>That they'll not &s;hew their teeth, in way of &s;mile,</L>
<L>Though Ne&s;tor &s;wear the je&s;t be laughable.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Gratiano then coming in, and taking notice of the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of Anthonio's a&s;pect, alike imputes it to the &s;ame cau&s;e his other friends had done:
<Q><PB N="53" REF="68">
<L>You look not well, Signior Anthonio;</L>
<L>You have too much re&s;pect upon the world;</L>
<L>They lo&s;e it that do buy it with much care.</L>
<L>Believe me, you are marvellou&s;ly changed.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which he replies:
<Q><L>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</L>
<L>A &s;tage where every man mu&s;t play his part;</L>
<L>And mine a &s;ad one.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this, Gratiano enters into the &s;ame hu|morous de&s;cription of the different characters of men, as Solarino had done.</P>
<Q><L>Let me play the fool;</L>
<L>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;</L>
<L>And let my liver rather heat with wine,</L>
<L>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</L>
<L>Why &s;hould a man, who&s;e blood is warm within,</L>
<L>Sit like his grandfire cut in alaba&s;ter?</L>
<L>Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice</L>
<L>By being peevi&s;h? I tell thee what, Anthonio,</L>
<L>(I love thee, and it is my love that &s;peaks)</L>
<L>There are a &s;ort of men, who&s;e vi&s;ages</L>
<L>Do cream and mantle like a &s;tanding pool,</L>
<L>And do a wilful &s;tillne&s;s entertain,</L>
<L>With purpo&s;e to be dre&s;t in an opinion</L>
<L>Of wi&s;dom, gravity profound conceit;</L>
<L>As who &s;hould &s;ay, "I am Sir Oracle,</L>
<L>"And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!"</L>
<L>O, my Anthonio, I do know of tho&s;e,</L>
<L>That therefore only are reputed wi&s;e,</L>
<L>For &s;aying nothing; who, I'm very &s;ure,</L>

<P>The great principle of univer&s;al charity, which &s;oars above the partial re&s;pects of nations or of &s;ects, is &s;trongly, though indirectly, inculcated, in the Jew's &s;peech, here; which, according to this very principle, &s;hould be received without prejudice, though proceeding from the mouth of an Alien, and an Infidel.</P>
<P>Shylock, &s;peaking of Anthonio,
<Q>He hath di&s;graced me, and hindered me of half a million, laughed at my lo&s;&s;es, mocked at my gains, &s;corned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his rea&s;on? <HI>I am a Jew.</HI> Hath not a Jew eyes?

<P>THIS Play begins with a reflection on the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and I may add the <HI>principal,</HI> concern in life, the education of children. Men are often more &s;edulous in training the brutes of their kennels, their mews and their &s;tables, than they &s;eem to be about the heirs of their blood, their fortunes, or their honours. In &s;ad truth may it be &s;aid, that we &s;eldom meet with a jockey, an hunt&s;man, or a &s;port&s;man, who is half &s;o <HI>well-bred</HI> as his hor&s;es, his hawks, or his hounds.</P>
<P>Orlando, &s;peaking of the unkindne&s;s of his elder brother and guardian, &s;ays,
<Q>For my part, he keeps me ru&s;tically at home; or, to &s;peak more properly, <HI>flies</HI> me here at home, unkept; for call you that keep|ing, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the <HI>&s;talling of an ox?</HI> His hor&s;es are bred better; for be&s;ides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage; and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which the animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Be&s;ides this Nothing that he &s;o plen|tifully gives me, the Something that Nature gave me his coun|tenance &s;eems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mines, <HI>for</HI> undermines.</NOTE> my gentility with my education.</Q></P>

<P>As there are many vices in morals that are injuri|ous to &s;ociety, and which the laws have not &s;tigma|tized, or po&s;&s;ibly cannot &s;ufficiently provide again&s;t, the reprehen&s;ions of Satire, under proper re&s;trictions, may perhaps be deemed a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplement to legi&s;lation. The mo&s;t worthle&s;s per&s;on would chu&s;e to &s;in in &s;ecret, as not being able to endure the being rendered an object of public dete&s;tation or ridicule; the fear of being <HI>pointed</HI> at has often laid a re&s;traint on vice; in which &s;en&s;e <HI>the finger</HI> may be &s;aid to be &s;tronger than <HI>the arm.</HI> Othello patheti|cally de&s;cribes &s;uch a &s;ituation:

<P>The abrupt commencement of this dialogue leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that it is but the continuation of one they had engaged in before their appearance in this &s;cene, in which Celia had been endeavouring to quiet Ro&s;alind's fears, upon her lover's having broke his promi&s;e of meeting her; and whether from being tired with her ob&s;tinacy, or re&s;olving to try her &s;incerity, &s;he here &s;eems to join in her re&s;entment, by agreeing with her in every thing; which has an effect very natural in all &s;uch ca&s;es, that the plaintiff immediately becomes defendant, whenever the per&s;on beloved happens to be cen&s;ured by any one el&s;e but them|&s;elves.</P>

<SPEAKER>Holofernes.</SPEAKER>
<P>His humour is lofty, his di&s;cour&s;e peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait maje&s;tical, and his ge|neral behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thra&s;onical. He is too pi|qued, too &s;pruce, too affected, too odd, as it were; too peregri|nate, as I may call it. He draweth out the thread of his verbo|&s;ity finer than the &s;taple of his argument. I abhor &s;uch fanatical phanta&s;ms, &s;uch un&s;ociable and <HI>point-devi&s;e</HI> companions; &s;uch rackers of Orthography, as to &s;peak <HI>dout</HI> fine, when he &s;hould &s;ay <HI>doubt; det,</HI> when he &s;hould pronounce debt; d, e, b, t, not d, e, t.

</SP></Q>
<P>But to return. The pedantry of &s;chola&s;tic defi|nitions, and the verbo&s;e &s;tile of law writings, are properly ridiculed, in the &s;econd Scene of the Fir&s;t Act, in part of Armado's letter to the king, giving an information of an offence committed again&s;t one of his &s;tatutes.</P>

<P>THE rational, &s;ociable, and friendly manner in which crowned heads u&s;ed formerly to live plea|&s;antly with one another, is de&s;cribed here&mdash;Why is it no longer &s;o? Does modern polity oppo&s;e it&s;elf to hu|manity? Kings may have mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, indeed; but friend or favourite they mu&s;t have none. What amends can the whole <HI>regalia</HI> of their &s;olitary pomp afford them, for being denied one of the &s;weete&s;t, the deare&s;t, and the mo&s;t virtuous enjoyments of life; a manly &s;ympathy of affections, and a cha&s;te intercour&s;e of &s;ouls! Modern kings may &s;ay, as Richard the Third did, <HI>I am my&s;elf alone; Incedo &s;olus</HI>; but not in the happy &s;en&s;e that Horace meant it&mdash;the <HI>quacunque libido e&s;t</HI> is wanting.</P>

<SPEAKER>Camillo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sicilia cannot &s;hew him&s;elf over-kind to Bohemia; they were trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then &s;uch an affection, which cannot chu&s;e but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal nece&s;&s;ities made &s;eparation of their &s;ociety, their encounters, though not per&s;onal, have been royally attornied with interchange of gifts, letters, loving emba&s;&s;ies; that they have &s;eemed to be together, though ab&s;ent; &s;hook hands, as over a va&s;t; and embraced, as it were, from the ends of oppo&s;ed winds.

Though I cannot help ob&s;erving here, that her vindictive &s;pirit appears plainly not to have yet &s;ub|&s;ided, but only taken a different cour&s;e, by the latter part of her &s;peech; for &s;he continues &s;till to accu|mulate her charges again&s;t him, as if only by way of enumerating the articles of her forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Our Author, who almo&s;t every where manife&s;ts a perfect knowledge in the anatomy of the human mind, proves his &s;cience more particularly in a pa&s;&s;age of this Scene, by &s;hewing a property in our natures which might have e&s;caped any common di&s;&s;ecter of morals; and this is, our &s;uffering, upon true penitence and contrition, not only all reproach thrown out again&s;t us with meekne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but even encouraging and augmenting the abu&s;e, by joining in our own condemnation. This may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from a &s;trong wi&s;h, or &s;anguine hope, that &s;uch a voluntary penance may in part be ac|cepted, both by heaven and the world, as &s;ome &s;ort of atonement for our crimes.</P>
<P>Leontes, while Paulina is arraigning him with the utmo&s;t virulence and &s;everity, in&s;tead of having her ca&s;t out from his pre&s;ence, cries,
<Q><L>Go on, go on&mdash;</L>
<L>Thou can&s;t not &s;peak too much; I have de&s;erved</L>
<L>All tongues to talk their bittere&s;t.</L></Q></P>

<P>In the Fir&s;t Scene of the Fifth Act, the &s;ame &s;ubject is renewed, where Leontes manife&s;ts the &s;ame humi|liation and contrition for his crime, that he did be|fore: but as an interval of &s;ixteen years, &s;pent in &s;orrow and repentance, had pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two aeras, he, as would be natural then, &s;hews an un|ea&s;ine&s;s at the reproach, and intreats to be relieved from it for the future; but this in a manner &s;o gentle and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, as none but Shake&s;peare him|&s;elf could have conceived.

<P>I was by at the opening of the fardel, and heard the old &s;hepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedne&s;s, we were all commanded out of the cham|ber. Only this, methought I heard the &s;hepherd &s;ay, he found the child.</P>

<P>I make a broken delivery of the bu&s;ine&s;s; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo, were very notes of admiration; they &s;eemed almo&s;t, with &s;taring on one another, to tear the ca&s;es of their eyes. There was a &s;peech in their dumbne&s;s, language in their very ge&s;ture; <HI>they looked, as they had heard of a world ran&s;omed, or one de&s;troyed</HI>; a notable pa&s;&s;ion of wonder ap|peared in them; but the wi&s;e&s;t beholder, that knew no more but &s;eeing, could not &s;ay if the importance were joy or &s;orrow; but in the extremity of the one, it mu&s;t needs be.</P>

<P>This de&s;cription not only contains the beautiful and the &s;ublime, but ri&s;es to a &s;till higher &s;ublimity, or, to &s;peak in the &s;tile of the P&s;almi&s;t, to the <HI>mo&s;t

highe&s;t,</HI> in the allu&s;ion to &s;acred writ, relating to the two principal articles in the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment, the fall of man, and his redemption. Shake|&s;peare makes frequent references to the &s;acred text, and writes often, not only as a morali&s;t, but as a divine.</P>
<P>Autolicus having by accident had &s;ome hand in bringing about the di&s;covery of Perdita, which was a circum&s;tance that might have been &s;uffi|cient to make another man's fortune, makes only this &s;ad &s;oliloquy upon the occa&s;ion:
<Q><HI>Now, had I not the da&s;h of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head.</HI> I brought the old man and his &s;on aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the &s;hepherd's daughter, &s;o he then took her to be, who began to be much &s;ea-&s;ick, and him&s;elf little better, extremity of weather continuing, this my&s;tery remained undi&s;covered. <HI>But 'tis all one to me; for had I been the finder out of this &s;ecret, it would not have reli&s;hed, among my other di&s;credits.</HI></Q></P>
<P>That <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy,</HI> is a homely proverb; but this only the more vouches the truth of it, by its having &s;tood the te&s;t of all experience. Character is the <HI>immediate jewel of the &s;oul,</HI> not only in its own worth, but even in the temporal advantages which frequently accrue from it. Lo&s;t health may be re|paired, lo&s;t fortune be regained, even lo&s;t &s;en&s;es may be recovered; but a forfeited character is rarely ever to be retrieved.</P>
<P>This is a theme which cannot be too largely or too frequently expatiated upon; which I hope will &s;erve as my apology for having taken the hint from &s;o mean and trifling an in&s;tance as the foregoing.</P>

<P>As I have hitherto ob&s;erved upon Shake&s;peare's critical knowledge in human nature, I hope it will not appear invidious now, if I &s;hould here remark upon his deficiency in a pa&s;&s;age above&mdash;lines &s;econd and third. The duke is there made to wi&s;h his pa&s;|&s;ion were extinct; which, I believe, the mo&s;t unhappy lover never yet did. We wi&s;h to remove every un|ea&s;y &s;en&s;ation it afflicts us with, by any means what|ever; &s;ometimes even by death it&s;elf; but never by the extinction of the affection.</P>
<P>This is not peculiar to love alone; 'tis the &s;ame in all the tender feelings. We wi&s;h the object of our grief brought back again to life, but de&s;ire not to forget our &s;orrow. We wi&s;h to relieve the &s;ubjects of our pity, but would not be deprived of our com|pa&s;&s;ion.

In the more heroic qualities of bravery and fortitude, can be traced no likene&s;s of the Deity, becau&s;e &s;uper|fluous in a perfect &s;tate. The &s;ubject of love is touched upon again, twice, in the &s;ame Scene:

And when Valentine acquaints the Duke with Oli|via's vow of &s;eque&s;tering her&s;elf from the world, for &s;even years, to mourn the death of her brother, he cries out in an exta&s;y,
<Q><L>O, &s;he that hath an heart of that fine frame,</L>
<L>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</L>
<L>How will &s;he love, when the rich golden &s;haft</L>

<L>That live in her? When liver, brain, and heart,</L>
<L>Three &s;overeign thrones, are all &s;upplied and filled</L>
<L>(O &s;weet perfection!) with one &s;elf-&s;ame king!</L></Q></P>
<P>I am happy that this latter pa&s;&s;age happens to oc|cur &s;o immediately after my remark above, as it affords me an opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to Shake|&s;peare, by ob&s;erving that his inference, from Olivia's grief, to the nature of her heart in love, &s;hews a perfect knowledge in this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy. The pa&s;&s;ions are divided into but two cla&s;&s;es, the tender and the violent; and any one of either affords an earne&s;t of all others of the &s;ame kind.</P>

For, upon a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having too weakly be|trayed her pa&s;&s;ion for Viola, appearing under the cha|racter of a cavalier, &s;he acquie&s;ces in her indi&s;cre|tion, by &s;aying,

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION. SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>Among the preparations which are making, in order to deceive the drunken Tinker into the notion of his having been a mad Lord ju&s;t recovering his &s;en&s;es, &s;ome Strollers are introduced to perform a Play for his entertainment; and the Actors meaning to exhibit one of the old religious Farces, &s;tiled the <HI>My&s;teries,</HI> upon enumerating the <HI>properties</HI> nece&s;&s;ary toward the repre&s;entation, a&s;k for
<Q>a little <HI>vinegar</HI> to make their Devil roar.</Q>
Upon which pa&s;&s;age Dr. Warburton gives the following note:</P>
<P><Q>When the acting the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> of the Old and New Te&s;tament was in vogue, at the repre&s;entation of the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> Judas and the Devil made a part. And the Devil, wherever he came, was always to &s;uffer &s;ome di&s;grace, to make the people laugh; as here the buffoonery was to apply the <HI>gall and vinegar,</HI> to make him roar. And the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> being that, of all the <HI>My&s;teries,</HI> which was mo&s;t frequently repre&s;ented, <HI>vinegar</HI> became at length the &s;tanding implement to torment the

Devil, and u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e even after the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> cea&s;ed and the <HI>Moralities</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certain allegorical pieces, where the Virtues and Vices were per&s;onified, which &s;ucceeded to the &s;tage, upon the prohibition of the former.</NOTE> came in vogue; where the Devil &s;till continued to bear a con&s;ider|able part. The mention of it here, was de&s;igned to ridicule &s;o ab&s;urd a circum&s;tance in the&s;e old Farces.</Q></P>
<P>The giving &s;uch theatrical repre&s;entations of Sa|cred Writ, was rather &s;omething more than barely <HI>ab&s;urd</HI>; it was extremely profane: but the device of tormenting the Devil with <HI>gall and vinegar,</HI> had a my&s;tic conceit in it; being certainly intended by the authors of the&s;e exhibitions, as an allu&s;ion to a cir|cum&s;tance in the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> mentioned by St. Matthew, where he &s;ays, <HI>they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall.</HI> Chap. xxvii. ver. 34.

<P>But, in general, indeed, it has been ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t haughty tyrants become, on a rever&s;e of fortune, the mo&s;t abject &s;laves; and this from a like principle, in both ca&s;es; that they are apt to im|pute the &s;ame &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m to the conqueror, they were before impre&s;t with them&s;elves; and con|&s;equently, are brought to tremble at the apprehen&s;ion of their own vice.</P>

<P>I do much wonder, that one man &s;eeing how much an|other man is a fool, when he dedicates his behaviour to love, will, after he hath laughed at &s;uch &s;hallow follies in others, become the argument of his own &s;corn, by falling him&s;elf in love! And &s;uch a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no mu&s;ic with him, but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor
<PB N="151" REF="161">
and the pipe. I have known when he would have walked ten miles a foot, to &s;ee a good armour; and now will he lye ten nights awake, carving the fa&s;hion of a new doublet. He was wont to &s;peak plain, and to the purpo&s;e, like an hone&s;t man, and a &s;oldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fanta&s;tical banquet, ju&s;t &s;o many &s;trange di&s;hes.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e reflections, Benedick goes on holding a debate with him&s;elf upon this &s;ubject; and, like mo&s;t people, before their hearts have become a party in the matter, draws a vain portrait of the peerle&s;s para|gon who only can be capable of triumphing over his affections; leaving nothing, in the choice of his mi&s;tre&s;s, to Heaven it&s;elf, except <HI>the colour of her hair.</HI></P>
<Q>May I be &s;o converted, and &s;ee with the&s;e eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be &s;worn but love may transform me to an oy&s;ter; but I'll take my oath, that till he have made one of me, he &s;hall never make me &s;uch a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wi&s;e, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well. But till all graces meet in one woman, one woman &s;hall not come in my grace.

<P>But, a little after, this good ca&s;ui&s;t a&s;ks her &s;ud|denly this trying que&s;tion:
<Q>Lady, what man is he you are accu&s;ed of?</Q>
Upon which pa&s;&s;age Doctor Warburton makes the following judicious remark:</P>
<P><Q>The Friar had ju&s;t before boa&s;ted his great &s;kill in &s;ifting out the truth; and indeed, he ap|pears, in this in&s;tance, to have been no fool. He was by, all the while at the accu&s;ation, and heard no names mentioned. Why, then, &s;hould he a&s;k her what man &s;he was accu&s;ed of? But in this lay the &s;ubtilty of his examination. For, had Hero been guilty, it was very probable that, in the hurry and confu&s;ion of &s;pirits into which the terrible in&s;ult of her lover had thrown her, &s;he
<PB N="159" REF="169">
would never have ob&s;erved that the man's name was not mentioned; and &s;o, on this que&s;tion, might have betrayed her&s;elf, by naming the per|&s;on &s;he was con&s;cious of an affair with. The Friar ob&s;erved this, and &s;o concluded, that, were &s;he guilty, &s;he would probably have fallen into the trap he had laid for her. I only take notice of this, to &s;hew how admirably well Shake&s;peare knew how to &s;u&s;tain his characters.</Q></P>
<P>But this noble defence for the unhappy Hero, not being &s;ufficient to obviate the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of her guilt, which the father had conceived again&s;t her, the hone&s;t Prie&s;t then goes on to propo&s;e a &s;cheme of conduct to him, which might peradven|ture bring about &s;ome cri&s;is or event, that would clear her innocence; at lea&s;t &s;ilence the infamy, and remove her from being any longer an object of ob|loquy. In this propo&s;al there is &s;hewn a ju&s;t knowledge of the world, and an intimate acquaintance with the &s;ecret movements of the human heart.</P>

<Q>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath &s;lander'd, &s;corn'd, di&s;honour'd my kin&s;woman! O, that I were a man! What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then with public accu&s;ation, uncover'd &s;lander, unmitigated rancour&mdash; O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place. O that I were a man for his &s;ake! or, that I had any friend would be a man for my &s;ake! But manhood is melted into courte&s;ies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too&mdash;He is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and &s;wears to it&mdash;I cannot be a man with wi&s;hing, there|fore I will die a woman with grieving.</Q></P>
<P>There is a generous warmth of indignation in this &s;peech, which mu&s;t certainly impre&s;s a female reader with the &s;ame &s;entiments upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I am not &s;o di&s;ingenuous to take advantage of this pa&s;&s;age as an hi&s;torical fact, but am willing to re&s;t it upon the &s;ole authority of the Poet's a&s;&s;umption, as this will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the de&s;ign of my intro|ducing it; which is, to vindicate my &s;ex from the general, but unju&s;t charge of being prone to &s;lander; for were this the ca&s;e, were not the re&s;entment of Beatrice, in this in&s;tance, natural, how could it move our &s;ympathy? which it actually does here, even though we acknowledge the circum&s;tance to have been merely imaginary.</P>
<P>I believe, that there is nothing which a woman of virtue feels her&s;elf more offended at, than defama|tion or &s;candal; fir&s;t again&s;t her own character, and proportionably when others are made the victims.

<P>As I commenced my remarks on this Play with a note of Doctor Warburton's, I &s;hall conclude them, al&s;o, with another very judicious ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame critic upon this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<P><Q>This brother Anthony is the true&s;t picture ima|ginable of human nature. He had a&s;&s;umed the character of a Sage, to comfort his brother o'er|whelmed with grief for his only daughter's affront and di&s;honour; and had &s;everely reproved him for not commanding his pa&s;&s;ion better, on &s;o try|ing an occa&s;ion. Yet, immediately after this, no &s;ooner does he begin to &s;u&s;pect that his age and valour are &s;lighted, but he falls into the mo&s;t in|temperate fit of rage him&s;elf; and all his brother can &s;ay, or do, is not of power to pacify him. This is copying Nature with a penetration and exactne&s;s of judgment peculiar to Shake&s;peare. As to the expre&s;&s;ion, too, of his pa&s;&s;ion, nothing can be more highly painted.</Q></P>

<P>THE Counte&s;s of Rou&s;illon &s;peaking of Helena, her Ward, &s;ays,
<Q>I have tho&s;e hopes of her good, that her education promi&s;es her; di&s;po&s;ition &s;he inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for her &s;implene&s;s; &s;he derives her hone&s;ty, and achieves her goodne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The Commentators are not agreed in opinion upon the <HI>verbal</HI> &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age&mdash;but no matter; I &s;hall leave their critici&s;m undecided, and proceed to the moral interpretation of it; which is, that a <HI>derived</HI> virtue, which implies a natural good di&s;po|&s;ition, affords con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a good edu|cation; that accompli&s;hments, without &s;uch a foun|dation, are a di&s;advantage to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as but tending to their condemnation and reproach; that the innocence and &s;implicity of Helena's mind and heart made u&s;e of no arts, but left her talents to the natural effect of their own operations; and that though a good di&s;po&s;ition may be <HI>inherited,</HI> virtues mu&s;t be <HI>purcha&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Scene, when Bertram comes to take leave of his mother, in order to attend the king, &s;he gives him her ble&s;&s;ing in a mo&s;t pathetic manner, and the mo&s;t effectual too, where the &s;eeds of virtue are, by &s;etting his noble father before him as a pat|tern. To this &s;he likewi&s;e adds &s;ome precepts for the conduct of his life, which would have done honour to the fir&s;t Sages of Aegypt, Greece, or Rome.</P>

<P>Frequent de&s;criptions of love recur in almo&s;t every one of Shake&s;peare's Plays. The enamoured Helena &s;peaks very affectingly on this &s;ubject here; fir&s;t, by reproving the vain ambition of her pa&s;&s;ion for Bertram, a young nobleman &s;o far above her hopes, and then proceeding, notwith&s;tanding, though very naturally, to give an account of the fond in|dulgencies with which &s;he &s;till nouri&s;hes her flame.</P>

<P>THE following &s;peech, though delivered with an air of levity, and expre&s;&s;ed in humorous words and images, &s;upplies occa&s;ion for three very ju&s;t reflections. The fir&s;t, That <HI>&s;elf intere&s;t,</HI> in the mere worldly &s;en&s;e of the term, is the ruling prin|ciple of mankind. Secondly, That men are too apt to inveigh again&s;t corruption, more from the being void of temptation them&s;elves, than their being free from this vice; and, la&s;tly, That bad examples in the &s;uperior ranks of life, have a dangerous tendency to injure the morals of the inferior cla&s;&s;es of a people.</P>

<Q>I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.</Q>

<L>What &s;ince thou &s;wore&s;t, is &s;worn again&s;t thy&s;elf,</L>
<L>And may not be performed by thy&s;elf.</L>
<L>For that which thou ha&s;t &s;worn to do ami&s;s,</L>
<L>Is't not ami&s;s when it is truly done?</L>

<P>There is &s;omething very tender and affecting in her making u&s;e of the epithet <HI>pretty,</HI> in the la&s;t line.

<Q>There are many touches of Nature in this conference of John with Hubert. A man engaged in wickedne&s;s would keep the profit to him&s;elf, and transfer the guilt to his accomplice. The&s;e re|proaches vented again&s;t Hubert, are not the words of art or policy, but the eruptions of a mind &s;well|ing with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a crime, and de&s;i|rous of di&s;charging its mi&s;ery on another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This account of the timidity of guilt, <HI>had&s;t thou but &s;hook thy head,</HI> &amp;c. is drawn <HI>ab ip&s;is rece&s;&s;ibus mentis,</HI> from an intimate knowledge of mankind; particularly that line in which he &s;ays, that <HI>to have bid him tell his tale in expre&s;s words</HI> would have <HI>&s;truck him dumb.</HI> Nothing is more certain, than that bad men u&s;e all the arts of fallacy upon them|&s;elves, palliate their actions to their own minds by gentle terms, and hide them&s;elves from their own detection in ambiguities and &s;ubterfuges.</Q></P>

<P>Afterwards, when Bolinbroke is called upon to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he al&s;o replies as bravely; but as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in &s;o much an inferior man|ner to the former, I think it could afford the reader no great entertainment to have the pa&s;&s;age quoted.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>When the King &s;entences the&s;e two champions to exile, he exacts an oath from them both, not to be reconciled to one another abroad, &s;o far as to con|federate again&s;t the &s;tate of England; in the ad|mini&s;tering of which bond, he de&s;ires them to
<Q><L>Swear by the duty that you owe to Heaven. . . . .</L>
<L>Our part therein we bani&s;h with your&s;elves.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon which latter line Doctor Warburton gives the following note:</P>
<P><Q>It is a que&s;tion much debated among the writers on the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> whether a bani&s;hed man be &s;till tied in allegiance to the &s;tate which &s;ent him into exile. Tully and Clarendon declare for the affirmative: Hobbes and Puffendorf hold
<PB N="193" REF="203">
the negative. Our Author, by this line, &s;eems to be of the latter opinion.</Q></P>
<P>But I agree intirely with Cicero and Clarendon. The undergoing any penalty of law cannot di&s;&s;olve either the moral or the political duty we owe our country. Socrates, by refu&s;ing to e&s;cape out of pri&s;on, &s;hewed, that he thought his obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;tate continued &s;till to be obliga|tory on him, even though the decree was unju&s;t, and the &s;entence death. And under the <HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> which impo&s;ed bani&s;hment upon men for their very eminence and virtue, we do not hear of the illu&s;tri|ous exiles either &s;peaking, or acting, as if they deemed their allegiance to have been cancelled.</P>
<P>Nay, Ari&s;tides carried the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a good &s;ubject &s;o far, as to think him&s;elf obliged in duty to write his own name on a <HI>&s;hell,</HI> at the reque&s;t of an illiterate citizen of Athens, who voted again&s;t him on that very law. And Themi&s;tocles, though bani&s;hed through the &s;pirit of faction, not that of the laws, and kindly entertained and preferred in the armies of Per&s;ia, cho&s;e to &s;wallow poi&s;on, rather than march again&s;t his country.</P>
<P>'Tis not the community that bani&s;hes a man, but the laws which govern it.</P>
<Q>"It is the law, not I, condemns your brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angelo to I&s;abella. <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
<P>The&s;e &s;urely are no object of re&s;entment; and to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t a nation, becau&s;e one of its &s;tatutes had fallen heavy upon us, would be ju&s;t as rational, as to &s;et a fore&s;t on fire, becau&s;e we had received the ba&s;tinado by a cudgel that was taken out of it.</P>

</SP>
<P>Upon which pa&s;&s;age there is the following reflec|tion, in the note by Doctor John&s;on:</P>
<P><Q>It is matter of very melancholy con&s;ideration, that all human advantages confer more power of do|ing evil, than good.</Q>
A very melancholy reflection, indeed, were we to &s;uppo&s;e it true!</P>
<P>In the in&s;tance before us, the hand of power, &s;trength, or treachery, may certainly deprive us of a life, which it cannot re&s;tore; but Shake&s;peare does not mean to make the reflection univer&s;al. A good Prince may render his whole people happy; a bad one can only affect a part. When tyranny becomes general, it defeats it&s;elf, at the co&s;t of the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>If my objection to the above uncomfortable maxim be valid, in the highe&s;t example, it would be trifling to adduce any le&s;&s;er ones to prove it.</P>

<P>There are undoubtedly certain notices, or premo|nitions, in the order of Providence, which mankind have been frequently &s;en&s;ible of; &s;ometimes from dreams, at other times from unaccountable impre&s;|&s;ions on the mind, foreboding particular misfortunes of our lives, let philo&s;ophy rea&s;on again&s;t the no|tion ever &s;o wi&s;ely.</P>
<P>Indeed, there appears one argument to oppo&s;e this opinion, which, in any indifferent ca&s;e, might be thought &s;ufficiently able to overthrow it; which is, that &s;uch hints rarely, if ever, have been found to an&s;wer any other purpo&s;e, than to render us unhappy before our time.</P>
<P>But matter of fact is not to be controverted by &s;yllogi&s;m. The objection only &s;erves to re&s;olve it into a my&s;tery, and leaves it &s;till uninve&s;tigable by human &s;cience. The more of &s;uch inexplicable &s;ecrets of Providence which fall under our ob&s;erva|tion, the better; as they may &s;erve to rouze the Athei&s;t from his lethargy, and afford the Dei&s;t oc|ca&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect, at lea&s;t, that what he calls <HI>Na|tural Religion,</HI> is not the intire &s;cheme of the Divine oeconomy with regard to men:

<P>The method that men take to di&s;gui&s;e the nature of their vices, by palliating epithets, is of dangerous con&s;equences in life. It not only &s;erves to blunt the edge of remor&s;e in our&s;elves, but often helps to in|duce a milder cen&s;ure in others, upon the mo&s;t fla|grant enormities.</P>
<P>Thus a pro&s;tigate fellow, who debauches every woman in his power, is &s;tiled <HI>a man of galantry</HI>; a pennyle&s;s adventurer, who carries off a rich heire&s;s,

<P>I think I may venture to pronounce, for the ho|nour of human nature, that the mo&s;t abandoned per|&s;on breathing, means not to pa&s;s his whole life in a &s;tate of profligacy. He purpo&s;es, from time to time, <HI>to take up,</HI> as the phra&s;e is; but is too apt, from time to time, to procra&s;tinate his amendment; thus &s;ilenc|ing the clamours of his con&s;cience, by the hopeful de&s;ign of reformation, and thinking his repentance &s;ufficiently advanced, by a &s;elf-confe&s;&s;ion of his vice or immorality.</P>
<P>The danger of this &s;pecies of <HI>quieti&s;m,</HI> is &s;trongly pointed out, in part of a work lately publi&s;hed; and as it may afford a u&s;eful warning to &s;ome of my di&s;&s;ipated readers, I &s;hall quote the pa&s;&s;age I allude to here.</P>

<P>The following &s;peech affords us a beautiful in|&s;tance of this method of amu&s;ing our too flexible and indolent tempers of mind; which I copy here with the greater plea&s;ure, as the &s;peaker of it did effectually reform his life and manners, and has en|riched the annals of England with a memoir of true glory.</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales, &s;peaking of his loo&s;e com|panions, who had ju&s;t quitted the &s;cene, &s;ays,
<Q><L>I know ye all, and will a-while uphold</L>
<L>The unyoked humour of your idlene&s;s;</L>
<L>Yet herein will I imitate the &s;un,</L>
<L>Who doth permit the ba&s;e contagious clouds</L>
<L>To &s;mother up his beauty from the world;</L>
<L>That when he plea&s;e again to be him&s;elf,</L>
<L>Being wanted, he may be more wondered at,</L>
<L>By breaking through the &s;oul and ugly mi&s;ts</L>

<P>When the brave Hot&s;pur is taxed by the king with having refu&s;ed to &s;urrender the pri&s;oners which he had taken at the gallant action of <HI>Holmedon-Moor,</HI> to his order, the &s;peech he makes upon that occa&s;ion, in excu&s;e for his refractorine&s;s, pre&s;ents us with a

<SPEAKER>Hot&s;pur.</SPEAKER>
<L>My liege, I did deny no pri&s;oners;</L>

<L>When I was dry with rage, and extreme toil,</L>
<L>Breathle&s;s and faint, leaning upon my &s;word,</L>
<L>Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Fre&s;h as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped,</L>
<L>Shewed like a &s;tubble land at harve&s;t home.</L>
<L>He was perfumed like a milliner,</L>
<L>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</L>
<L>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</L>
<L>He gave his no&s;e, and took't away again.</L>
<L>And &s;till he &s;miled and talked&mdash;</L>
<L>And as the &s;oldiers bare dead bodies by,</L>
<L>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</L>
<L>To bring a &s;lovenly unhand&s;ome cor&s;e</L>
<L>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</L>
<L>With many holiday and lady terms</L>

<P>The noblene&s;s of Hot&s;pur's character is ad|mirably &s;u&s;tained throughout this Play. The fol|lowing &s;peech &s;hews a fine part of it:
<Q><STAGE>Hot&s;pur <HI>to</HI> Dowglas.</STAGE>
<L>Well &s;aid, my noble Scot. If &s;peaking truth,</L>
<L>In this fine age, were not thought flattery,</L>
<L>Such attribution &s;hould the Dowglas have,</L>
<L>As not a &s;oldier of this &s;ea&s;on's &s;tamp,</L>
<L>Should go &s;o general current through the world.</L>
<L>By heaven, I cannot flatter, I defy</L>
<L>The tongues of &s;oothers; but a braver place,</L>
<L>In my heart's love, hath no man than your&s;elf&mdash;</L>
<L>Nay, ta&s;k me to my word; approve me, lord.</L></Q></P>
<P>The precarious and critical &s;ituation of unwar|rantable and hazardous undertakings, is well re|flected upon in the following pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame Scene, when the con&s;pirators are informed that Northumberland is prevented by &s;ickne&s;s from at|tending the rendez-vous:
<Q><STAGE>Worce&s;ter <HI>to</HI> Hot&s;pur.</STAGE>

<P>The Commentator, by the word <HI>hair,</HI> in this place, under&s;tands <HI>complexion or character,</HI> and finds fault with the har&s;hne&s;s of the metaphor. But I think, from the la&s;t part of the &s;entence, that the Poet meant the expre&s;&s;ion literally.

<L>That wi&s;dom, loyalty, and meer di&s;like</L>

<L>And think how &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion</L>

<L>This ab&s;ence of your father draws a curtain,</L>
<L>That &s;hews the ignorant a kind of fear,</L>
<L>Before not dreamt upon.</L></Q></P>
<P>The gallant &s;pirit of Hot&s;pur is well &s;hewn in his reply:
<Q><L>You &s;train too far;</L>
<L>I rather of his ab&s;ence make this u&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>It lends a lu&s;tre and more great opinion,</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I thought that my ta&s;k was done with this Play, when I had got to the end of it; but there is &s;ome|thing &s;o very great, &s;ingular, and attractive, in the two principal characters of this hi&s;toric piece, that I find a plea&s;ure in keeping them &s;till in view, and contemplating them both in my mind.</P>
<P>Whenever Hot&s;pur or the Prince <HI>filled the Scene,</HI> which they are either of them, &s;ingly, &s;ufficient to do, I confe&s;s that my heart was &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch an emotion, as Sir Philip Sidney &s;aid he u&s;ed to be affected with, on a peru&s;al of the old Ballad of Chevy-Cha&s;e; <HI>as if he had heard the &s;ound of a trumpet.</HI> Perhaps the following ob&s;ervation may better account for my impul&s;e:</P>
<P>Women are apt to e&s;teem the <HI>antient virtue</HI> of courage at an higher rate than men in general are; and this, for the&s;e two e&s;pecial rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t, that it is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to their per&s;onal defence; and the next, that their weak|ne&s;s induces them to form a &s;ublimer notion of this quality, than the &s;tronger, and therefore braver, &s;ex may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to compliment it with. Men, feeling the principles of it in their own brea&s;ts, conceive no very &s;upernatural idea of it; while
<PB N="227" REF="237">
women, having no &s;uch premi&s;&s;es to rea&s;on from, look on it as &s;omething more than human.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, with the frequent occa&s;ions I have had, thoughout this Play, of comparing the two heroes of it with each other, have tempted me to undertake a Parallel between them, after the man|ner of Plutarch; which, however, I did not mean to have given the Reader, as hinted above, 'till I &s;hould come to the end of the &s;econd Play after this, where our Author has concluded all he had to &s;ay about Henry the Fifth.</P>
<P>But as Shake&s;peare has opened enough of this Prince's character, here, to &s;upply &s;ufficient materials for the compari&s;on, and that his unfortunate rival is ju&s;t &s;lain, I thought the Parallel might have a better effect on the mind of my Readers, in this place, than it would be likely to produce after the delay had &s;uffered the impre&s;&s;ion of Hot&s;pur's qua|lities to wear out of their remembrance.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="excursus">
<HEAD>A PARALLEL BETWEEN HOTSPUR, AND HENRY PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are both equally brave; but the courage of Hot&s;pur has a greater portion of fiercene&s;s in it&mdash; The Prince's magnanimity is more heroic. The fir&s;t re&s;embles Achilles; the latter is more like Hector. The different principles, too, of their actions help to form and ju&s;tify this di&s;tinction; as the one <HI>invades,</HI> and the other <HI>defends,</HI> a right. Hot&s;pur &s;peaks nobly of his rival Dowglas, to his face, but after he is be|come his friend; the Prince does the &s;ame of Hot&s;pur, behind his back, and while he is &s;till his enemy.</P>
<P>They both of them po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;portive vein of humour in their &s;cenes of common life; but Hot|&s;pur &s;till pre&s;erves the &s;urly and refractory haughti|ne&s;s of his character, throughout, even in the relaxa|tions
<PB N="228" REF="238">
he indulges him&s;elf in. The Prince has more of ea&s;e and nature in his; delivering him&s;elf over to mirth and di&s;&s;ipation, without re&s;erve. Hot&s;pur's fe&s;tivity &s;eems to re&s;emble that of Hamlet; as a&s;|&s;umed merely to relieve anxiety of mind, and cover &s;anguinary purpo&s;es; the Prince's gaiety, like that of Faulconbridge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In King John.</NOTE>, appears to be more genuine, ari|&s;ing from natural temper, and an healthful flow of &s;pirits. The Prince is Alcibiades&mdash;Percy is&mdash;him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another character in this rich Play, of a mo&s;t peculiar di&s;tinction; as being not only <HI>original,</HI> but <HI>inimitable,</HI> al&s;o&mdash;No copy of it has ever &s;ince appeared, either in life or de&s;cription. Any one of the Dramatis Per&s;onae in Congreve's Comedies, or, indeed, in mo&s;t of the modern ones, might repeat the wit or humour of the &s;eparate parts, with equal effect on the audience, as the per&s;on to who&s;e r&ocirc;le they are appropriated; but there is a certain characteri&s;tic peculiarity in all the humour of Fal&s;taff, that would &s;ound flatly in the mouths of Bardolph, Poins, or Peto. In fine, the portrait of this extraordinary per&s;onage is delineated by &s;o ma|&s;terly a hand, that we may venture to pronounce it to be the only one that ever afforded &s;o high a degree of plea&s;ure, without the lea&s;t pretence to merit or virtue to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I was obliged to pa&s;s by many of his &s;trokes of humour, character, and de&s;cription, becau&s;e they did not fall within the rule I had pre&s;cribed to my|&s;elf in the&s;e notes; but I hone&s;tly confe&s;s that it was with regret, whenever I did &s;o; for, were there as much moral, as there certainly is phy&s;ical, good in laughing, I might have tran&s;cribed every Scene of his, throughout this, the following Play, and the Merry Wives of Wind&s;or, for the advantage of the health, as well as the entertainment, of my readers.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poins.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, by this light, I am well &s;poken of; I can hear it with my own ears. The wor&s;t they can &s;ay of me, is, that I am
<PB N="236" REF="246">
a &s;econd brother, and that I am <HI>a proper fellow of my hands</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was an expre&s;&s;ion, in tho&s;e times, for <HI>a per&s;on forward in fighting.</HI></NOTE>; and tho&s;e two things, I confe&s;s, I cannot help.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The delicacy of the Prince's difficulty upon this occa&s;ion, in not being able to manife&s;t the concern he was really &s;en&s;ible of for his father's illne&s;s, le&s;t, from the former complexion of his life and manners, he might be &s;u&s;pected of in&s;incerity in &s;uch pro|fe&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t have a fine effect on the &s;entiment of a reader who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lea&s;t refinement of principle or virtue.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;on might be framed, upon the very &s;ingular character of this amiable per&s;on. The pattern is not perfect; and therefore&mdash;&s;hall I venture to &s;ay it? the example is the better, for that rea&s;on. His manners are idle, but his morals uncorrupt. He &s;uf|fers Fal&s;taff to make as free with him as he plea&s;es, but breaks his head, as Mrs. Quickly tells us in a former Scene, for his having thrown out a je&s;t upon his father. Young men may learn from him never to be guilty of more vice, than the temptation to it might precipi|tate them into. He connives at the robbery of his companions, for the diver&s;ion of playing the &s;ame game upon them, again; but re&s;olves to make ample re|&s;titution for the wrong <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the la&s;t Scene of Act II, in the fir&s;t part of this Play.</NOTE>. He offends his father by the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of his conduct; but his filial affec|tion and re&s;pect are &s;till unremitted towards him. He &s;hews a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice in inju&s;tice, and of duty, even in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>I here offer this comment as a &s;upplement to the character I have already drawn of this Prince, at the end of the former Play. I could not have fairly added it there, as any thing that did not im|mediately relate to the compari&s;on between him and Hot&s;pur, would have been improperly introduced in the Parallel.</P>

<P>When the amba&s;&s;adors of France come before Henry, they a&s;k him whether they may &s;peak their errand in expre&s;s words, or mu&s;t be re&s;trained to de|liver the &s;ub&s;tance of it only, in more covert terms. To which he replies:

<L>We are no tyrant, but a Chri&s;tian king,</L>
<L>Unto who&s;e grace our pa&s;&s;ion is as &s;ubject,</L>

<L>Tell us the Dauphin's mind.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The above &s;peech is worth noting, con&s;idering the maxim generally. Re&s;entment may be excu&s;able in a man, but is unpardonable in a king. In this character he is to con&s;ider him&s;elf but as one of the &s;tates of government only; and legi&s;lature is di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate. Shall a judge &s;uffer him&s;elf to be bia&s;&s;ed by private pique, when pronouncing a public &s;en|tence? When power is made u&s;e of to revenge per|&s;onal affronts, royalty cea&s;es, and tyranny begins.</P>

<P>After the &s;urrender of Harfleur, when Henry is on his march to Calais, he is met by Mountjoy, the French Herald, who delivers an in&s;olent defiance from the king of France, requiring to know what ran&s;om he will compound to pay, for leave to retire alive out of the kingdom; to which he replies,
<Q><L>Thou do&s;t thy office fairly. Turn thee back,</L>
<L>And tell thy king I do not &s;eek him now,</L>
<L>But could be willing to march on to Calais</L>

<L><HI>Almo&s;t no better than &s;o many French;</HI></L>
<L>Who, when they were in health, I tell thee, Herald,</L>

<L>Did march three Frenchmen&mdash;Yet, forgive me, God,</L>
<L>That I do brag thus! this your air of France</L>

<L>Go, therefore, tell thy ma&s;ter, here I am&mdash;</L>
<L>My ran&s;om is this frail and worthle&s;s trunk,</L>

<P>There is &s;omething extremely fine in Henry's reply to the French ga&s;conading taunt above. It is uncommon to meet with &s;o much carele&s;sne&s;s and courage in the &s;ame character&mdash;There is no &s;uch de&s;cription in hi&s;tory, nor have many people, pro|bably, ever been acquainted with it among the living manners of men; and yet the repre&s;entation of it appears to be &s;o perfectly natural, that we mu&s;t greatly admire the talents of a writer, who could thus realize, in effect, a mere idea.</P>
<P>The bravery of Henry &s;corned to deny the con|dition of his troops, either with regard to their health or numbers: the&s;e circum&s;tances the enemy pretended to have been acquainted with already, or were determined to make an experiment of, at lea&s;t; he therefore openly acknowledges the truth of his weak &s;ituation; and this with the &s;ame ea&s;e and humour, as he would have delivered him&s;elf to Fal&s;taff, had he been his aid-du-camp for the day.
<Q><L>Upon his royal face there is no note,</L>
<L>How dread an army have enrounded him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chorus to Act IV.</NOTE>;</L></Q>
But, at the &s;ame time, he mo&s;t re&s;olutely declares his purpo&s;e of trying the event; at every hazard of life, claim, and liberty.</P>
<P>The contemptuous &s;arca&s;ms he throws out, in this &s;peech, again&s;t the French nation, be&s;ides &s;hewing an admirable temper and compo&s;ure of mind in &s;uch difficult circum&s;tances, convey al&s;o an apt re|partee to the &s;cornful in&s;olence of the Dauphin; who, in return to Henry's demanding his right of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, &s;ent him a parcel of tennis-balls to play with, in allu&s;ion to the &s;light repute of his former life and manners, Pertne&s;s is impertinence; but repartee has the <HI>lex talionis,</HI> or law of retaliation, on its &s;ide.</P>

<P>But if the cau&s;e be not good, the king him&s;elf hath a heavy reckoning to make; when all tho&s;e legs, and arms, and heads, chopped off in a battle, &s;hall join together at the latter day, and cry all, <HI>we died at &s;uch a place</HI>; &s;ome &s;wearing, &s;ome crying for a &s;urgeon, &s;ome upon their wives left poor behind them, &s;ome upon the debts they owe, &s;ome upon their children rawly left. I am afeared there are few die well, that fall in battle; for how can they charitably di&s;po&s;e of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if the&s;e men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king, that led them to it, whom to di&s;obey were again&s;t all proportion of &s;ubjection.</P>

<P>So, if a &s;on that is &s;ent by his father about merchandize, do fall into &s;ome lewd action, and mi&s;carry, the imputation of his wickedne&s;s, by your rule, &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon the father that &s;ent him; or, if a &s;ervant under his ma&s;ter's command, tran&s;porting a &s;um of money, be a&s;&s;ailed by robbers, and die in many irrecon|ciled iniquities, you may call the bu&s;ine&s;s of the matter the author of the &s;ervant's damnation. But this is not &s;o&mdash;The king is not bound to an&s;wer the particular endings of his &s;oldiers, the father of his &s;on, nor the ma&s;ter of his &s;ervant; for they purpo&s;e not their deaths, when they purpo&s;e their &s;ervices. Be&s;ides, there is no king, be his cau&s;e never &s;o &s;potle&s;s, if it come to the arbitrament of &s;words, can try it with all un&s;potted &s;oldiers. Some, perad|venture, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; &s;ome of beguiling virgins with the broken &s;eals of per|jury; &s;ome making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bo&s;om of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if the&s;e men have defeated the law, and out-run native puni&s;hment, <HI>though they can cut-&s;trip men, they have no wings to fly from God.</HI> War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; &s;o that herein men are puni&s;hed, for before-breach of the king's law, in the king's quarrel
<PB N="267" REF="277">
now&mdash;Where they feared death, they have borne life away; and where they would be &s;afe, they peri&s;h. Then, if they die unpro|vided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation, than he was before guilty of tho&s;e impieties for which they are now vi&s;ited. Every &s;ubject's duty is the king's, but every &s;ubject's &s;oul is his own. Therefore &s;hould every &s;oldier, in the wars, do as every &s;ick man, in his bed, wa&s;h every moth out of his con&s;cience; and, dying &s;o, death is to him an advantage; or, not dying, the time was ble&s;&s;edly lo&s;t, wherein &s;uch preparation was gained; and to him that e&s;capes, it were not &s;in to think that, making God &s;o free an offer, he let him out-live that day to &s;ee his greatne&s;s, and to teach others how they &s;hould prepare.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t &s;entence in the above &s;peech, is one among the many in&s;tances in which Shake&s;peare has manife&s;ted his thorough knowledge in human nature. Henry acts with an heroic re&s;olution during the whole of this perilous conflict, and replies with a daring and carele&s;s &s;pirit to all the in&s;olence and contempt of a powerful enemy; but he expre&s;&s;es no rage, nor betrays the lea&s;t manner of re&s;entment, throughout. The dangers and difficulties of his &s;ituation required the utmo&s;t command and pre&s;ervation of his temper. Di&s;tre&s;s and affliction are &s;overeign &s;pecifics for the pride and fiercene&s;s of man's nature. But the&s;e re|&s;traints being now removed, by his victory, he begins to yield the rein a little to pa&s;&s;ion, upon &s;eeing the ob&s;tinacy of the enemy &s;till continuing after their defeat.</P>

You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a touch of them, than in all the tongues of
<PB N="283" REF="293">
the French council; and they would &s;ooner per&s;wade Harry of England, than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>In the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age of the foregoing dialogue, Henry affords a good &s;ubject for reflection, where he &s;peaks of the powerful influence of kings over the manners of a people. The maxim appears to be plau&s;ible, but is not true, in every re&s;pect. <HI>Rank and example</HI> alone, will not be &s;ufficient for this effect, un&s;upported by <HI>dignity and precept.</HI> It is not enough for a prince to act well him&s;elf, and intend well to morals&mdash;He mu&s;t form a purpo&s;e for their &s;upport, and be active in his general, as well as private, capacity. A &s;overeign, indeed, has it in his power, whenever it is in his will, mo&s;t effectually to encourage virtue, and di&s;courage vice, if he chu&s;es to make this object the rule of his polity. This would be the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t method of rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute; for as poor Cardinal Wol&s;ey &s;ays&mdash;upon a maxim too late di&s;covered&mdash;
<Q>"Corruption wins not more than hone&s;ty."</Q>
Religion it&s;elf has judged it nece&s;&s;ary to hold out di&s;tant rewards and puni&s;hments, to allure and deter mankind, and kings can only have a right to be &s;tiled the vice-gerents of Heaven, when they render the&s;e &s;anctions more immediate. A king is &s;aid to have long hands; but they are of no u&s;e except to wrap him&s;elf up, <HI>while he keeps them folded.</HI></P>
<P>Lewis the Fourteenth happily brought &s;uch a <HI>golden age</HI> to bear, toward the latter part of his il|lu&s;trious reign, if we may give credit to what St. Evremond &s;ays, in a letter of his to Ninon de l'Enclos.</P>
<P><Q>You live in a country where people have ex|traordinary advantages towards &s;aving their &s;ouls. There, vice is almo&s;t as much again&s;t the fa&s;hion, as again&s;t virtue. Sinning pa&s;&s;es for ill-breeding; &s;hocks decency, and offends good manners, as much as religion. Formerly, it &s;ufficed to be
<PB N="284" REF="294">
wicked; but, at pre&s;ent, one mu&s;t be a &s;coundrel, to be damned, in France. They who have not regard enough for another life, are led to &s;alva|tion by the con&s;ideration and duties of this.</Q></P>
<P>In order to leave the impre&s;&s;ion of this mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting and moral reflection more &s;trongly on the minds of the great, the powerful, and the opulent, I &s;hall here conclude my ob&s;ervations on this Piece, &s;o fruitful of example and document, throughout.</P>

<P>The partiality which we are all apt to manife&s;t to|wards our own intere&s;ts, is well noted in this place. This principle is &s;o powerful in human nature, that it not only engages our affections, but warps our judgments al&s;o; &s;o that it often impo&s;es on our rea&s;on, and frequently makes us continue ob&s;tinate, more from error than &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Our opinions dif|fer, even in matters of no concernment to us; and how much le&s;s is it to be expected, that we &s;hould be of accord, when we are become a party in the que&s;tion our&s;elves?</P>

<P>There is &s;omething extremely moving, in the fir&s;t part of this Scene, which &s;hews a pri&s;on from whence old Earl Mortimer is brought forth in a chair, before the gates, attended by his gaolers. He had been unfortunately declared heir to the Crown, by Richard the Second, and was therefore kept a

pri&s;oner of State, during the reigns of Henrys the Fourth and Fifth, and continued &s;till in confine|ment, under the pre&s;ent king al&s;o.</P>
<P>We are naturally more affected at the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of age, infancy, or women, than with what we &s;ee &s;uffered by the adult or robu&s;t unfortunate. Our compa&s;&s;ion ri&s;es in proportion to the weakne&s;s of the victim, as we become &s;en&s;ible of the inability of re&s;i&s;tance, along with the weight of the oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The earne&s;t de&s;ire which the unhappy old man expre&s;&s;es here, for the relief of death, is very na|tural to a per&s;on in his circum&s;tances; and can by no means be deemed reprehen&s;ible, in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, when the completion of the wi&s;h is not for|warded by any act of violence or impatience in the &s;ufferer.</P>

<P>The following reflection has too often been made, both before and &s;ince the aera here pointed out. It is &s;hocking to humanity, as well as to religion, to think that there &s;hould ever have been, and &s;hould &s;till continue, &s;uch frequent occa&s;ions to repeat it.</P>

<L>That &s;uch immanity and bloody &s;trife</L>
<L>Should reign among profe&s;&s;ors of one faith.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>In the &s;ame Scene, when the king is urged to think of marrying, he very properly objects to the

<L>A dower, my lords! Di&s;grace not &s;o your king,</L>
<L>That he &s;hould be &s;o abject, ba&s;e, and poor,</L>
<L>To chu&s;e for wealth, and not for perfect love.</L>
<L>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</L>
<L>And need not &s;eek a queen to make him rich.</L>
<L>So worthle&s;s pea&s;ants bargain for their wives,</L>
<L>As market-men for oxen, &s;heep, or hor&s;e.</L>
<L><HI>But marriage is a matter of more worth,</HI></L>

<L>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</L>

Ju&s;t &s;uch a prince, who&s;e very goodne&s;s, for want of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, mu&s;t ever render the dupe of Mi|ni&s;ters, and the &s;port of Faction.</P>
<P>No document, no example, are &s;o effectual a warn|ing to the mind, as the view of a wicked per&s;on in his la&s;t moments. This &s;peaks to the heart, as well as to the under&s;tanding. We then &s;ee things and actions in their true light, which the fal&s;e glare of gain or plea&s;ure, or the involved and complicated nature of &s;in, are but too apt to hide from our notice. Vice would di&s;gu&s;t even tho&s;e that practi&s;e it, if they did not u&s;e arts to conceal the vilene&s;s of it from their own view. We drink liquors out of a cup, which are too foul to bear a gla&s;s.</P>
<P>He who has betrayed a friend, deceived a mi&s;tre&s;s, wronged the orphan, or oppre&s;&s;ed the poor, mu&s;t &s;urely never have &s;een a penitent on his death-bed!

<P>This is the only way of rendering dramatic deaths profitable to the &s;pectators.

<P>Shake&s;peare lays hold of every occa&s;ion that fairly pre&s;ents it&s;elf, to put his readers out of conceit with greatne&s;s.

<P>This long Scene, in which Richard courts Lady Anne, relict of the fir&s;t Prince of Wales, &s;on to Henry the Sixth, whom he had murdered, is &s;o well known to every one who has ever read or &s;een this Play, that I need not be at the trouble of tran&s;crib|ing it, though I &s;hall take the liberty of remarking on the very improbable conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Women are certainly mo&s;t extremely ill u&s;ed, in the unnatural repre&s;entation of female frailty, here given. But it may, perhaps, be &s;ome palliation of his offence, to ob&s;erve that this &s;trange fable was not any invention of the poet; though it mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed that he yielded too ea&s;y a credence to a fictitious piece of hi&s;tory, which re&s;ted upon no better authority than the &s;ame that affirmed the de|formity of Richard; which fact has lately, from a concurrence of cotemporary te&s;timonies, been ren|dered

<P>The evil report of things &s;aid to be &s;poken to the di&s;advantage of others, behind their backs, has &s;o frequently been found to proceed either from the malice or mi&s;take of eaves-droppers, li&s;teners, or in|cendiaries, that it &s;hould warn us, upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions, to &s;u&s;pend our re&s;entments again&s;t the per&s;ons charged, till we find the indictment to be grounded on better evidence than tho&s;e pe&s;ts of &s;ociety the in|formers, intermeddlers, or tale-bearers.

<P>Now nothing can demon&s;trate the inve&s;tigating faculties of Shake&s;peare, more than this pa&s;&s;age does.

<PB N="317" REF="324">
what renders the &s;olution of this pa&s;&s;age &s;till more difficult, is, that the reque&s;t is made by a per&s;on, too, who&s;e mind was deeply intent on murder and u&s;urpation, at the very time.</P>
<P>None of the editors have taken the lea&s;t notice of this article; and the fir&s;t notion that occurred to me upon it, was, that perhaps Richard wanted to get rid of old Ely, after any manner, however indecent or abrupt, in order to be at liberty to plot with Buck|ingham in private; for the moment the Bi&s;hop goes out on his errand, he &s;ays,
<Q>Cou&s;in of Buckingham, a word with you.</Q>

<P>There is, then, no other way left us to re&s;olve this text, than to impute it &s;olely to the peculiar cha|racter that Shake&s;peare has given us all along of this extraordinary per&s;onage; whom he has repre&s;ented throughout, as pre&s;erving a facetious humour, and exerting a &s;ort of carele&s;s ea&s;e, in the mid&s;t of all his crimes.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry not to be able to give a better account of this particular, than what I have here offered; becau&s;e, if it is to re&s;t upon &s;uch a comment, our author mu&s;t, in this in&s;tance, be thought to have be|trayed a manife&s;t ignorance in human nature, or the nature of guilt at lea&s;t; as no vicious per&s;on, I do not mean tho&s;e of profligate manners merely, but no de&s;igning or determined villain was ever chearful, yet, or could po&s;&s;ibly be able to a&s;&s;ume even the &s;emblance of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or ea&s;e, upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever.</P>

<P>Among the various crimes of man, murder &s;tands in a di&s;tinct cla&s;s above them all; except, perhaps, &s;uicide, as being of the &s;ame &s;pecies, may be allowed to rank with, or even to exceed, it. The latter par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this po&s;ition, tho', has been di&s;puted by &s;ome mo|ral ca&s;ui&s;ts; but I &s;hall enter no further into the ar|gument here, than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that one of the&s;e acts does not &s;hock the human mind &s;o much as the other.

<P>But the circum&s;tance which mo&s;t eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hes both of the&s;e crimes from every other &s;pecies of guilt, is their being &s;o wholly repugnant to na|ture.

<P><Q>Sweet are the &s;lumbers of the virtuous man,</Q>
&s;ays Addi&s;on, in his Cato; and a modern writer, in a poem on the &s;ubject of dreams, mo&s;t emphatically expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:

<L>He &s;tarts appalled, <HI>for con&s;cience &s;lumbers not</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Something New,</HI> Chap. XLIX.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>That this is the &s;en&s;e in which our Poet meant this &s;cene to be accepted, is fully evident from his repre&s;enting both <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> to have been a&s;leep during the apparition, and therefore capable
<PB N="321" REF="328">
of receiving tho&s;e notices in <HI>the mind</HI>'s <HI>eye</HI> only, as Hamlet &s;ays; which intirely removes the &s;eeming ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an exhibition.</P>
<P>The &s;oliloquy of &s;elf-accu&s;ation, which Richard enters upon alone, immediately after the &s;pectral vi&s;ion is clo&s;ed, though &s;o &s;trongly marked, is nothing more than might be &s;uppo&s;ed natural, in the circum|&s;tances and &s;ituation of the &s;peaker, as there de&s;cribed.</P>

<L>What! do I fear my&s;elf? there's none el&s;e by. . . .</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>I &s;hall here clo&s;e my ob&s;ervations on this Play, with a reflection upon the la&s;t paragraph above.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="329">Such is the nature of man, that the &s;lighte&s;t alarm, ari&s;ing from within, di&s;comfits him more than the greate&s;t dangers pre&s;enting them&s;elves from without. Body may be overcome by body, but the mind only can conquer it&s;elf. Notions of religion are natural to all men, in &s;ome &s;ort or other. The good are in&s;pired by devotion, the bad terrified by &s;uper&s;tition. The admonitions of con&s;cience are taken for &s;uper|natural emotions, and this awes us more than any dif|ficulty in the common cour&s;e of things. Man has been &s;everally defined a <HI>ri&s;ible,</HI> a <HI>rational,</HI> a <HI>religious,</HI> and a <HI>ba&s;hful</HI> animal. May I take the liberty of add|ing the farther criterion of his being a <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> one? And this di&s;tinction, I &s;hall venture to &s;ay, is le&s;s equivocal than any of the others.</P>

<P>There is an excellent le&s;&s;on for kings, given in this place, as well as in many other pa&s;&s;ages of Shake&s;peare. The honour and &s;afety of princes are &s;o much confided to the &s;en&s;e and conduct of their Mini&s;ters, that &s;uch tru&s;tees for the State &s;hould be ever &s;elected with the nice&s;t judgment and &s;tricte&s;t impartiality; in which choice, virtue &s;hould be at lea&s;t <HI>equally</HI> regarded with talents.

<HEAD>LEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to many Readers to premi&s;e, that the Piece here under con&s;ideration, is the Play as originally written by Shake&s;peare, left the bearing it in mind as altered by <HI>Tate,</HI> and generally acted &s;o, might occa&s;ion confu&s;ion or mi&s;takes, in the following notes and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The Critics are divided in their opinions between the original and the altered copy. Some prefer the fir&s;t, as a more general repre&s;entation of human life, where fraud too often &s;ucceeds, and innocence &s;uf|fers: others prefer the latter, as a more moral de|&s;cription of what life &s;hould be.</P>
<P>But argument in this, as in many other ca&s;es, had better be left quite out of the que&s;tion; for our feel|ings are often a &s;urer guide than our rea&s;on; and by this criterion I may venture to pronounce, that the reader or &s;pectator will always be better plea&s;ed with the happy, than the unfortunate, cata&s;trophe of innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Dramatic exhibitions are de&s;igned, as they certainly &s;hould be, to recommend virtue and di&s;courage vice, there cannot remain the lea&s;t man|ner of di&s;pute in our minds, whether Shake&s;peare or Tate have fulfilled Horace's precept of <HI>utile dulci</HI> the be&s;t. However, if <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>terror,</HI> as the Critics &s;ay, are the principal objects of Tragedy, &s;urely no Play that ever was written can po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer both the&s;e ends better than this performance, as it &s;tands in the pre&s;ent text.</P>
<P>The Reader, I hope, will not think that I have exceeded the <HI>line</HI> I had pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf, in the conduct of this Work, by my hazarding the above critici&s;m, as the &s;ubject may be &s;till con&s;idered as of

a moral nature or tendency, and may, therefore, not improperly be con&s;orted with the re&s;t of my remarks upon this e&s;timable author.</P>

<P>It did always &s;eem &s;o to us; but, now, in his divi&s;ion of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values mo&s;t; for qualities are &s;o weighed, that curio&s;ity <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> for <HI>&s;crutiny.</HI></NOTE> in neither can make choice of either's moiety.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is a fine de&s;cription of a parent's di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, in the divi&s;ion of a fortune between his chil|dren. Their claims are all equal in nature, and &s;hould be &s;till pre&s;erved &s;o in equity, except where particular u&s;ages may have obtained, or political laws have made a difference; in which ca&s;es, to ob|&s;erve the rule of nature would be a &s;pecies of in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I &s;peak here with regard to conduct; of principle only, and not of affection; for 'tis often impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t virtuous or impartial parent to refrain from loving one child better than another. A inn|di&s;criminate regard, in any ca&s;e, towards two objects, though ever &s;o much alike or e&s;timable, is unnatural to the mo&s;t impartial mind; and though our rea&s;on &s;hould not be able to give a preference, our feelings will.</P>
<P>The oft-di&s;puted <HI>free will</HI> of man may be &s;uffi|ciently proved from this innate &s;elf-determination, which his mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. We mu&s;t make a choice, even without our being able to make a di&s;tinction. It mu&s;t be an a&s;s, indeed, that can remain in &s;u&s;|pence even <HI>between two bundles of hay.</HI> But this in|voluntary election we are not an&s;werable for in

<L>And 'tis our fa&s;t intent</L>
<L>To &s;hake all cares and bu&s;ine&s;s from our age,</L>
<L>Conferring them on younger &s;trengths; while we</L>
<L>Unburdened crawl toward death.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is a rational, a manly, and a virtuous pur|po&s;e. But how few are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ouls <HI>great</HI> enough to relinqui&s;h <HI>greatne&s;s!</HI> Indeed, the rare ex|amples of tho&s;e who have done &s;o, as Charles the Fifth, and &s;ome others, would not encourage one to make the experiment. But then it ought to be en|quired into, whether the in&s;tances of abdication had been prompted by any of the principles above-men|tioned, or no; for mere fits of devotion, or di&s;gu&s;t, are &s;eldom long or &s;trong enough, to &s;upport the mind under &s;uch a dereliction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, habit is a mo&s;t powerful thing; and per|&s;ons u&s;ed to occupation of any kind, are apt to feel an irk&s;ome vacuity and wearine&s;s in them&s;elves, with an oppre&s;&s;ive tediou&s;ne&s;s of time lying on their hands, whenever they cea&s;e from employment. This has been the confe&s;&s;ion of all the merchants, lawyers, farmers, and phy&s;icians, I have ever known, or heard of, who had retired from their profe&s;&s;ions, or quitted their ordinary &s;cenes of action, late in life. When|ever, therefore, &s;uch an experiment is attempted, it &s;hould ari&s;e from a <HI>principle,</HI> not from a <HI>preference</HI>; becau&s;e the choice mu&s;t be ventured upon, before the compari&s;on can be tried.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Scene, when Lear requires his three daughters to declare the &s;everal portions of their love and re&s;pect towards him, the elde&s;t addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to him thus:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Goneril.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir,</L>
<L>I love you more than words can wield the matter,</L>
<L><PB N="354" REF="360">Dearer than eye-&s;ight, &s;pace, and liberty;</L>
<L>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</L>
<L>No le&s;s than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</L>
<L>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</L>
<L>A love that makes breath poor, and &s;peech unable,</L>
<L>Beyond all manner of &s;o much I love you.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Upon this &s;peech, the younge&s;t daughter &s;ays to her&s;elf, a&s;ide,
<Q>What &s;hall Cordelia do? Love, and be &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P>After Goneril has had her portion marked out, the &s;econd &s;teps forward, in order to earn her's.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Regan.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm made of that &s;elf-metal as my &s;i&s;ter,</L>
<L>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,</L>
<L>I find &s;he names my very deed of love,</L>
<L>Only &s;he comes too &s;hort: that I profe&s;s</L>
<L>My&s;elf an enemy to all other joys,</L>
<L>Which the mo&s;t precious &s;quare of &s;en&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>And find I am alone felicitate,</L>
<L>In your dear highne&s;s love.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Here the &s;incere and unprofe&s;&s;ing Cordelia whi&s;pers to her&s;elf again:
<Q><L>Then poor Cordelia!</L>
<L>And yet not &s;o, &s;ince I am &s;ure my love's</L>
<L>More ponderous than my tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>When Lear has endowed Regan al&s;o, he next proceeds to challenge Cordelia upon the &s;ame que&s;|tion; a&s;king her what &s;he has to &s;ay, to &s;hew her love equal to her &s;i&s;ters; her only an&s;wer is,
<Q>Nothing, my lord.</Q></P>
<P>But, indeed, what was there left for her to &s;ay, after &s;uch hyperbolical profe&s;&s;ions as had been ju&s;t made before her? However, I dare pronounce, that any reader, who is at all acquainted with human na|ture, without looking any further into the &s;tory, be|yond the pre&s;ent &s;cene, mu&s;t have already determined the point in his own mind, which of the daughter's duties or affections were mo&s;t to be relied upon.</P>
<P>No pa&s;&s;ion can either bear or ju&s;tify exaggeration, but love alone. There the extravagance of tran&s;|port, and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of devotement, prove the
<PB N="355" REF="361">
<HI>luxuriance</HI> of the &s;oil; but in every other in&s;tance, betray the <HI>&s;terility</HI> of it. There is, in reality, no other pa&s;&s;ion in the human brea&s;t, but love. All other affec|tions, &s;uch as avarice, duty, envy, revenge, or am|bition, ari&s;e from &s;ome foreign &s;entiment, are founded on principle, or in&s;tigated by vice or pride. The&s;e we may be educated, tempted, or provoked to; but the former is a &s;pontaneous and involuntary impul&s;e of the &s;oul, a certain attractive force, that can nei|ther be dictated to us by moral, nor re&s;trained by document.</P>
<Q><L>Fir&s;t bid phy&s;icians preach our veins to temper,</L>
<L>And with an argument new &s;et a pul&s;e,</L>
<L>Then think of rea&s;oning into love.</L>

<P>Thus do all profligates, who de&s;erve to be the outca&s;ts of &s;ociety, betake them&s;elves to the a&s;ylum of Nature.

<P>Lucretius, the expo&s;itor of Epicurus, in his un|philo&s;ophic poem on the nature of things, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;ame godde&s;s, under the appellation of <HI>Venus,</HI> whom he makes to precede and &s;uper&s;ede the gods, repre&s;enting them as a &s;et of lethargic beings of

her creation, and leaving them to doze away their immortalities wrapt up in their empyreal <HI>Pantheon.</HI></P>
<P>The pride of man is amazing! Rather than ac|knowledge any Intelligence &s;uperior to them&s;elves, they chu&s;e to refer the manife&s;t wi&s;dom and power of the Deity to blind chance, and inert matter alone!

<P>The &s;urprize and re&s;entment expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t part of the above &s;peech, is ju&s;t and natural; but the pau&s;e of recollection which afterwards abates his anger, is extremely fine, both in the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the reflection, and the humanity of the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>This beautiful pa&s;&s;age, with many others of the &s;ame tender kind, which follow in the cour&s;e of developing Lear's character, and which I &s;hall oc|ca&s;ionally refer back from to this note, render this unhappy man a real object both of commi&s;eration and e&s;teem, notwith&s;tanding the weakne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ion, and inju&s;tice he has &s;o fully expo&s;ed in the beginning of this Play.</P>

<P>Here poor Lear &s;eems to make &s;ome kind of amends for his former violence; for though the provocation continues &s;till the &s;ame, nay rather, in|deed, is increa&s;ed by the repetition of it, yet he contents him&s;elf, in this place, with barely upbraid|ing and reviling the offender, but refrains from add|ing cur&s;es to his reproaches.</P>
<P>Human nature is equally di&s;cernible in both the&s;e in&s;tances.

<L>Come, your hovel&mdash;</L>

<HEAD>SCENE V.</HEAD>
<P>When they have arrived near the hovel, Lear changes his purpo&s;e, on account of a rea&s;on he afterwards gives, regarding the di&s;tracted &s;tate of his mind; and being pre&s;&s;ed by Kent, who ju&s;t then joins him, to take &s;helter from the outrage of the night, he cries,
<Q>Let me alone.</Q>
And being intreated, a &s;econd time, he repeats the &s;ame an&s;wer. But upon being further urged by the kind earne&s;tne&s;s of his poor &s;ervant, which Kent &s;till pre&s;erves the appearance of, he then exclaims, with emotion,
<Q>Wilt break my heart?</Q></P>
<P>How truly affecting is this &s;hort expo&s;tulation, if quickly conceived? It was not the importunity of Kent, that he meant to ob&s;erve upon; the expre&s;&s;ion needed not to have been &s;o tender, to have marked &s;uch an offence: Princes are apt to re&s;ent the con|trolement of their wills or actions, in a &s;everer &s;tile. But it was the in&s;tantaneous compari&s;on between the barbarity of his own daughters, which had reduced him to &s;uch a wretched condition, and the humanity of a common alien kindly pre&s;&s;ing him to a &s;helter from it, that &s;o &s;uddenly &s;truck and affected his mind, at that moment&mdash;This thought, indeed, might well be &s;aid to <HI>break his heart</HI>; and to have added a &s;ingle word more, to explain this &s;entiment, would have marred the whole beauty of the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="369">Upon Kent's &s;till continuing his entreaty, he &s;till refu&s;es to comply, but rea&s;ons with him thus:
<Q><L>Thou think'&s;t 'tis much that this contentious &s;torm</L>
<L>Invades us to the &s;kin&mdash;So 'tis to thee&mdash;</L>
<L>But where the greater malady is fixt,</L>

<L>But if thy flight lay toward the roaring &s;ea,</L>
<L>Thou'd&s;t meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,</L>

<L>Doth from my &s;en&s;es take all feeling el&s;e,</L>
<L>Save what beats there</L></Q></P>
<P>This is the true nature of the human mind; the greater evil always &s;wallowing up the le&s;&s;er, as the rod of Mo&s;es did the other &s;erpents. And in great calamities I do not know but it might, perhaps, be an advantage to have &s;ome other ills of an inferior nature to combat with, at the &s;ame time; for, as Lear &s;ays, ju&s;t after, as his rea&s;on for refu&s;ing to take &s;helter,
<Q><L>This tempe&s;t will not give me leave to ponder,</L>
<L>On things would hurt me more.</L></Q></P>
<P>When he con&s;ents, at la&s;t, to enter the hut, he pre&s;&s;es his two attendants to go in fir&s;t, &s;aying,
<Q>I'll pray, and then I'll &s;leep.</Q></P>

<P>Strict philo&s;ophy, perhaps, may not admit of &s;uch a di&s;tinction in men, merely from the difference of outward circum&s;tances alone; but the habits and opinions of the world will always operate both on our &s;entiments and feelings, on a compari&s;on, to the full extent of the maxim here laid down.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, indeed, without having the lea&s;t manner of re&s;pect to per&s;ons, that &s;uperior degree of cala|mity which can be capable of piercing through the &s;tronger &s;hields of &s;tation, opulence and power, be|fore it can inflict its arrows upon princes, mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, render them &s;till greater objects of com|mi&s;eration, than tho&s;e who&s;e condition in life may be &s;uppo&s;ed to lye more open to the ordinary a&s;&s;ails of misfortune.

<P>Glo&s;ter &s;eems to have the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of things, when in the following Scene he expre&s;&s;es a &s;urprize, that becau&s;e Lear is di&s;ordered in his &s;en&s;es, he &s;hould &s;till be able to retain his own: though, indeed, he makes but a &s;ad deduction from the reflection.</P>

<P>When Edgar, by killing of Goneril's &s;teward, gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the di&s;patches he was carrying to the enemy, he takes a re&s;olution to open them; which he prefaces thus:

<P>But, however certain <HI>rea&s;ons of State</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly render &s;uch an action nece&s;&s;ary, there is &s;omething in it, notwith&s;tanding, at which the liberal and in|genuous mind naturally revolts.
<Q>Beyond the fixed and &s;ettled rules, &amp;c.</Q>
The compari&s;on he makes, indeed, is certainly &s;trong, in favour of the le&s;&s;er evil, regarding merely the &s;imple po&s;ition of the que&s;tion; but then he &s;hould have re&s;trained him&s;elf to the &s;aying the latter was more <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> or <HI>humane,</HI> than have pronounced it to be more <HI>law|ful</HI> For it is this very circum&s;tance, the <HI>legality</HI> of the former Act, which marks the difference between them; and which, though &s;evere, yet being founded on the maxims of the <HI>Civil-Law,</HI> that

<P>Timon, upon hearing of his friend Ventidius being thrown into a gaol, &s;ays to the me&s;&s;enger,
<Q><L>Commend me to him, I will &s;end his ran&s;om;</L>
<L>And being enfranchi&s;ed bid him come to me.</L>
<L><HI>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But to &s;upport him after.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t lines contain a noble &s;entiment of friend|&s;hip, charity, and genero&s;ity&mdash;It has merit enough in it&s;elf, to &s;tand alone; but would have double the effect on an hearer, if pronounced by a per&s;on of a more prudent and provident character.</P>
<P>This thought is beautifully expre&s;&s;ed, in an old Elegy written on the good bi&s;hop Boulter, who died Primate of Ireland, &s;ome years ago:
<Q><L>&mdash;He thought it mean,</L>

<P>And again, in Scene V. (for I chu&s;e to collect like &s;entiments under the &s;ame head) he &s;ays to
<PB N="382" REF="387">
Ventidius, who comes to thank him for his friend|&s;hip, and to repay the debt,

<L><HI>Can truly &s;ay he gives, if he receives.</HI></L></Q></P>

<L>What levity's in youth.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is a &s;en&s;ible and philo&s;ophic reflection, and &s;hould be more attended to, than it generally is: for there are no per&s;ons fit to educate, to guide, or in&s;truct young people, but tho&s;e who have not for|gotten their own youth. Parents and grand-parents are apt, too often, to require their children and grand-children &s;hould benefit of their earned know|ledge and long experience, and &s;o go on from thence, improving &s;till in &s;en&s;e and virtue. It would be a happy thing, indeed, if we could put morals on the foot of &s;cience, which is thus progre&s;&s;ive; but they mu&s;t be very ignorant of human nature, who expect it.</P>
<P>"Old folks," as an ingenious modern author expre&s;&s;es it,

<P>Whenever I have happened to ob&s;erve what are called <HI>the virtues of age</HI> to be innate in youth, I have naturally expected to meet with the vices of it there al&s;o; and have but rarely found any one of &s;uch character uninfected with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or avarice.</P>

<P>IT has been much di&s;puted among the Commen|tators, whether this Play be originally Shake|&s;peare's, or only the work of &s;ome elder Author, revi&s;ed and improved for repre&s;entation by him: though, if I might be allowed to venture a criti|ci&s;m upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the intire Piece to be his, and for a very &s;ingular rea&s;on; Be|cau&s;e the whole of the fable, as well as the conduct of it, is &s;o very <HI>barbarous,</HI> in every &s;en&s;e of the word, that I think, however he might have been tempted to make u&s;e of the legend, in &s;ome hurry or other, for his own purpo&s;e, he could hardly have adopted it from any other per&s;on's compo&s;ition. We are quick-&s;ighted to the faults of others, though purblind to our own. Be&s;ides, he would never have &s;trewed &s;uch &s;weet flowers upon a <HI>caput mortuum,</HI> if &s;ome child of his had not lain entombed un|derneath. Many of the beauties I hint at, being merely poetical imagery, without any mixture of moral in them, are therefore not in&s;erted among the following notes, as not being the proper object of my remarks, which mu&s;t, in con&s;equence, appear to fall &s;hort of the above compliment.</P>
<P>The arguments, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> for the authenticity of this Play, are not material to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e; for as we find it among the mu&s;ter-roll of our Author's forces, it challenges a right to pa&s;s in review along with the re&s;t, though there are but very few pa&s;&s;ages in it to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of this work.</P>
<P>I &s;hould imagine, from the many &s;hocking &s;pec|tacles exhibited in this Play, that it could never have been repre&s;ented on any theatre, except the

poetical a &s;tile, rather, for &s;o &s;ad a &s;ubject; but I think the fir&s;t argument of it a very &s;trong one, upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;
<Q>If there were rea&s;on for the&s;e mi&s;eries, &amp;c.</Q>
For we certainly &s;uffer tho&s;e misfortunes, which happen to our lot in the common cour&s;e of nature or of ju&s;tice, with much more re&s;ignation of mind, than we can do tho&s;e which are inflicted on us by the violences of tyranny, cruelty, or malice&mdash;Here our dete&s;tation and abhorrence of the agent, &s;erves to heighten our re&s;entment of the injury.</P>
<P>In the two la&s;t lines above, Shake&s;peare has given an elevation to the common expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>lo&s;ers have leave to &s;peak.</HI> There are in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, in our Author, before taken notice of. This is one of his characteri&s;tics; and, indeed, I think that his &s;tile and manner are &s;o &s;trongly marked, through|out this Play, (take the above &s;peech, for one in|&s;tance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of it, for I have tran&s;cribed it &s;hort.</NOTE>) that I own it &s;urprizes me Doctor John&s;on &s;hould &s;ay,
<Q>he did not think Shake&s;peare's touches di&s;cernible in it.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Scene, when &s;ome &s;hocking objects of his wretchedne&s;s are pre&s;ented to the view of Titus, he makes a very natural reflection upon them, for a per&s;on in &s;uch unhappy circum&s;tances.</P>
<Q><L>Ah, that this &s;ight &s;hould make &s;o deep a wound,</L>
<L>And yet dete&s;ted life not &s;hrink thereat!</L>
<L>That ever death &s;hould let life bear his name,</L>
<L>Where life hath no more intere&s;t than to breathe!</L></Q>
<P>In the extremities of angui&s;h, either of mind or body, we are apt to be &s;urpri&s;ed at that toughne&s;s in our frame, which prevents its di&s;&s;olution; and are often tempted to wi&s;h our mi&s;eries might of them&s;elves have &s;ufficient force to bring us that re|lief, which our virtue or religion forbids us to &s;upply our&s;elves.</P>

<P>Our &s;ex is obliged to Shake&s;peare, for this pa&s;&s;age. He &s;eems to think that a woman could not be rendered compleatly wicked, without &s;ome degree of in|toxication.

<P>Macbeth, after he had committed the murder, &s;peaking of the Grooms, who lay in the ante|chamber he had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through, &s;ays,
<Q><L>One cried, <HI>God ble&s;s us!</HI> and <HI>Amen!</HI> the other;</L>

<P>This is natural&mdash;One of the mo&s;t horrid circum|&s;tances of guilt, is that total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion a wicked per&s;on is apt to labour under, for a time, of the ability to pray. I &s;hould think that, from this very extraordinary circum&s;tance, Divines might deduce a good argument to &s;trengthen the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of theology. If, as the advocates for Natural Religion &s;ay, our vices proceed from the violence of our pa&s;&s;ions merely, contrition, upon their &s;cheme, might immediately &s;ucceed the gratification of our pur|po&s;e; but, as we are taught that temptation ari&s;es from the in&s;tigation of an evil &s;pirit, the fiend has &s;till a further intere&s;t in the po&s;tponing of our re|pentance. Suicide mu&s;t certainly be a &s;trong in&s;tance of this latter doctrine; as it prompts us, even con|trary to the intent of nature, and the general &s;cope, both of our affections, impre&s;&s;ions, and feelings, to the de&s;truction of our own exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame dialogue, when Ro&s;&s;e has given Mac|duff an account of the murder of his wife and chil|dren, at which he &s;eems to &s;tand petrified with &s;or|row, Malcolm ju&s;tly warns him of the dangerous

con&s;equences of re&s;training the natural &s;hews and expre&s;&s;ions of grief.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcolm.</SPEAKER>
<L>Merciful Heaven!</L>
<L>What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows&mdash;</L>
<L>Give &s;orrow words; the grief that does not &s;peak,</L>
<L>Whi&s;pers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break. . . .</L>
<L>Di&s;pute it like a man.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>To which Macduff as ju&s;tly replies, without any di&s;grace to philo&s;ophy or religion:
<Q><L>I &s;hall do &s;o;</L>
<L><HI>But I mu&s;t feel it as a man.</HI></L>
<L>I cannot but remember &s;uch things were,</L>
<L>That were mo&s;t precious to me.</L></Q></P>
<P>But he then proceeds to a reflection, which, though natural and common for the unhappy to make, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, offends again&s;t both the princi|ples above-mentioned, philo&s;ophy and religion, as being at once impious and unju&s;t:
<Q><L>Did Heaven look on,</L>
<L>And would not take their part?</L></Q></P>
<P>Lear, on &s;eeing Cordelia dead, makes an expo&s;tu|lation of the &s;ame &s;ort:

<L>And thou no breath at all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the la&s;t Scene of the Play.</NOTE>?</L></Q></P>
<P>But all this ari&s;es from a too pre&s;umptuous and over-weening notion of our own con&s;equence in the creation. The pride of man prompts each to con|&s;ider him&s;elf as the principal object of Providence; and we would all of us wre&s;t the &s;tated order of Nature, to &s;erve our own purpo&s;es. But the true philo&s;ophy of the matter is, as Pope very ju&s;tly ex|pre&s;&s;es it, in different parts of his E&s;&s;ay on Man,
<Q><L>The Univer&s;al Cau&s;e</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>As I cannot bear the thought of &s;uffering the la&s;t gloomy pa&s;&s;age cited in the foregoing remarks, to dwell upon my Reader's mind, which, by tempting him to repine at the ways of Providence, might give him cau&s;e to lament his having ever been &s;ent into &s;uch a <HI>world of woe,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to argue, as far as I am able, again&s;t &s;uch repre&s;entations of life as our author frequently gives us of our condi|tion in it, and in which he is too generally &s;econded by many of the more profe&s;&s;ed writers on Mo|rality.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="430">The&s;e philo&s;ophers are apt to &s;peak too &s;everely, upon the &s;um of human life; but only &s;eem to condemn it from di&s;tinct parts, and particular in|&s;tances, which vice, folly, pa&s;&s;ions, ca&s;ualty, or in|temperance, too often furni&s;h for ob&s;ervation. But I &s;hall here venture to treat this &s;ubject more im|partially, by con&s;idering it upon the whole, and according to the general &s;tate or condition in which the great Author of Nature has mo&s;t benevolently &s;upplied it to us.</P>
<P>We are created with five perfect &s;en&s;es, and the world is &s;tored with variety of objects to afford plea|&s;ures to them all; and the&s;e we are naturally framed to retain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, even to the full term of life pre&s;cribed by the P&s;almi&s;t, of <HI>three&s;core years and ten</HI>; till that period of time, when we may our&s;elves become weary of a longer continuance here, not from the <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> of our di&s;appointments, but merely from the <HI>&s;atiety</HI> of our enjoyments. And though our &s;trength may then, or even before, become weak|ne&s;s, it may not, however, be encumbered either with decrepitude or pain: and even to the la&s;t we may be &s;till capable of u&s;ing as much exerci&s;e, as age re|quires; or if any accidental ail &s;hould render more nece&s;&s;ary, an hor&s;e may re&s;tore the full benefit, at lea&s;t, though perhaps not the u&s;e, of our limbs.</P>
<P>Let us add to the&s;e, the plea&s;ures of hope, imagi|nation, reflection, reading, &s;cience, conver&s;ation, love, friend&s;hip,
<Q><L>Relations dear, and all the charities</L>
<L>Of father, &s;on, and brother.</L></Q>
Even our mo&s;t moderate &s;atisfactions and enjoyments, though their impre&s;&s;ions may not be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt, during their continuance, yet if their <HI>moment</HI> be cal|culated, by multiplying the degree into the duration, we &s;hall find the amount to exceed the quantity of more poignant but &s;horter &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="431">Let us al&s;o take into our account the vici&s;&s;itude and variety of &s;ea&s;ons, with the alternation of day and night;
<Q><L>Sweet is the breath of morn, her ri&s;ing &s;weet,</L>
<L>With charm of earlie&s;t birds; plea&s;ant the &s;un,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t on this delightful land he &s;preads</L>
<L>His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</L>
<L>Glitt'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth</L>
<L>After &s;oft &s;how'rs; and &s;weet the coming on</L>
<L>Of grateful evening mild; then &s;ilent night</L>
<L>With this her &s;olemn bird, and this fair moon,</L>
<L>And the&s;e the gems of Heaven, her &s;tarry train.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus are de&s;cribed the delights of Eden, by a Poet &s;o enamoured of the beauties of Nature, that he has certainly exerted his utmo&s;t powers to enhance her charms; and yet even Milton's imagination was not able to tran&s;cend the reality of tho&s;e objects and enjoyments, which our common fields and gardens afford us every day.</P>
<P>This is the common life of man; this the condi|tion of the yeoman, the hu&s;bandman, the labourer, the arti&s;t, the mechanic, the &s;ervant&mdash;the <HI>many</HI> of mankind. And where &s;ickne&s;s, pain, lo&s;s of any &s;en&s;e or limb, happens to the lot of individuals, this is not according to the <HI>cour&s;e</HI> of Nature, but rather a <HI>violence</HI> again&s;t it. And the&s;e accidents afflict not the <HI>many,</HI> but the <HI>few</HI>; nor is Provi|dence any more an&s;werable for the <HI>natural,</HI> than for the <HI>moral,</HI> ills of life: one is but incidental to the general con&s;titution and nece&s;&s;ity of things, and the other to the appetites and free-will of man.</P>
<P>But &s;loth, luxury, ambition, vicious pa&s;&s;ions, envy, hatred, and malice, may render &s;ome di&s;ea&s;ed in body, and others di&s;contented in mind. This is not, however, the <HI>condition</HI> of their nature, but the <HI>corruption</HI> of it; and the&s;e are &s;till not the <HI>many,</HI> but the <HI>few</HI>; not the <HI>body</HI> of the people, but the <HI>excre|&s;cences</HI> which ari&s;e out of it, and mu&s;t be nouri&s;hed at its co&s;t&mdash;namely, the great, the opulent, and the proud.</P>
<Q><PB N="428" REF="432">
<L>&mdash;The happine&s;s of life</L>

<P>If what I have here &s;aid, upon this comparative view of human nature, were not true, Providence mu&s;t have &s;hewn a manife&s;t partiality to the inferior creation, which is certainly placed in an happier &s;tate than man, according to &s;ome&mdash;to many writers. But Plato &s;peaks upon this &s;ubject with a much better philo&s;ophy than any of the&s;e moral &s;ophi&s;ters, when he &s;ays, that
<Q>God is good, for he be&s;tows all that is good upon all creatures, <HI>according to their &s;everal capacities.</HI> Each is as happy as it can be; or, <HI>as its nature permits</HI>; and if any thinks the &s;everal creatures could have been happier, it is becau&s;e he does not under&s;tand their natures.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Who &s;ees not Providence all good and wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Alike in what it gives, and what denies?</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>It may not be improper to quote a pa&s;&s;age here, out of a letter from Mr. Pope to Doctor Swift, upon the &s;ubject of his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I am ju&s;t now (&s;ays he) writing, or rather plan|ning, a book, to bring mankind to look upon this life with comfort and plea&s;ure, <HI>and put morality in good humour with it&s;elf.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the true philo&s;ophy of &s;en&s;e and virtue. Gloomy minds are deficient in both.</P>

<P>The above expre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>to plea&s;e his mother,</HI> is taken verbatim from Plutarch, who, in the Life of Coriolanus, &s;ays of him,<Q>The end which others propo&s;ed in their acts of valour, was glory; but he pur&s;ued glory, <HI>becau&s;e the acqui&s;ition of it delighted his mother.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Though this &s;eems to be a childi&s;h rea&s;on, yet 'tis very well to be accounted for. His father died when Caius Marcius was but an infant; the care of his education then devolved upon the mother, who gave him his fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons of bravery and honour, and took pains to in&s;pire his youth with that martial &s;pirit which &s;he thought became a Roman and a Patri|cian. It was natural, then, that his exploits &s;hould &s;till bear a reference to the per&s;on under who&s;e tu|telage he had been trained to arms.</P>

<P>But he is objected to, on account of a &s;ort of character, which is not uncommon in life, and is ju&s;tly de&s;criptive al&s;o of the per&s;on to whom it is applied; who, though certainly a very great man,

<L><HI>That other men begin.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Afterwards, when Ca&s;&s;ius urges the expediency of in|volving Antony in the &s;ame doom with Cae&s;ar, Brutus very nobly refu&s;es to concur, upon the following rea&s;ons:
<Q><L>Our cour&s;e will &s;eem too bloody, Caius Ca&s;&s;ius,</L>
<L>To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,</L>
<L>Like wrath in death, and envy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Envy,</HI> for <HI>malice.</HI></NOTE> afterwards;</L>
<L>For Antony is but a limb of Cae&s;ar,</L>
<L>And in the &s;pirit of man there is no blood.</L>
<L>Oh, that we then could come by Cae&s;ar's &s;pirit,</L>
<L>And not di&s;member Cae&s;ar! But, alas!</L>
<L>Cae&s;ar mu&s;t bleed for it&mdash;And, gentle friends,</L>
<L>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</L>
<L>Let's carve him as a di&s;h fit for the gods,</L>
<L>Not hew him as a carca&s;e fit for hounds;</L>
<L>And let our hearts, as &s;ubtle ma&s;ters do,</L>
<L>Stir up their &s;ervants to an act of rage,</L>
<L>And after &s;eem to chide them <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age is very ob&s;cure, and the Commentators, according to their u&s;ual &s;upinene&s;s, have left it unnoticed.

<L>Which &s;o appearing to the common eyes,</L>
<L>We &s;hall be deemed <HI>purgers,</HI> not <HI>murderers.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It were much to be wi&s;hed, for the &s;ake both of decency and humanity, that &s;uch a &s;entiment as this, was the &s;pirit of laws relative to all capital puni&s;hments.&mdash;Breaking on the wheel, empaling, and other foreign penalties of death, are horrible even to thought; and what mu&s;t they be to the view! Even our own code, though reckoned milder than our neighbours, is hardly le&s;s barbarous; in the in&s;tances of quartering, burning, and pre&s;&s;ing to death, if executed according to the full rigour of the &s;entence. But the hangman, it &s;eems, has more
<PB N="453" REF="457">
humanity than the legi&s;lature, as he is &s;aid always to render the criminal &s;en&s;ele&s;s, before he proceeds to the &s;everity of the &s;tatute. He fir&s;t kills the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> the <HI>demon</HI> of the law, and then only executes the <HI>dead</HI> letter of it.</P>
<P>There is a &s;entiment upon this &s;ubject, in a late writing, which I think may very properly be quoted here.
<Q>I would have all laws mild, but executed with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s; &s;o that ju&s;tice and humanity may go hand in hand together. I am not for &s;evere executions; for when the penalty exceeds the offence, it is not <HI>the criminal,</HI> but <HI>human nature</HI> that &s;uffers. Death alone is &s;uffi|cient to remove the offender <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Series of Letters between Henry and Frances.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But methinks this argument might be urged &s;till further in favour of clemency&mdash;Suppo&s;e we &s;hould rea&s;on thus:
<Q>All laws are a mutual compact of &s;ociety entered into with it&s;elf. The <HI>Many</HI> can confide to the <HI>Few</HI> tho&s;e rights only, which they re&s;pectively po&s;&s;e&s;s in them&s;elves. To confer a power of death, then, &s;hould &s;eem to imply <HI>a right of &s;uicide.</HI></Q>
I declare my&s;elf unable to de|tect any manner of &s;ophi&s;try, in &s;uch a &s;yllogi&s;m.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Cae&s;ar is a fact famous in hi&s;tory; but notwith&s;tanding the heroic opinion which the world has been taught to conceive of it, I confe&s;s that I have ever reputed its <HI>fame</HI> as a matter of <HI>notoriety</HI> rather than of <HI>applau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only con&s;ider this action in the per&s;on of Brutus alone, becau&s;e it has been thought that he was the only one among the con&s;pirators who had engaged in it upon principle &s;olely, as Antony has &s;aid above.</P>
<P>Plutarch has debated this &s;ubject, in his compari&s;on of Brutus with Dion; and, in my opinion, &s;eems to condemn it, upon the whole. At lea&s;t, if we take in the character he there draws of Cae&s;ar, with the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the Commonwealth at that political cri&s;is, it plainly appears that he meant to declare again&s;t it.</P>
<P>His words are:
<Q>With re&s;pect to Cae&s;ar, though, whil&s;t his imperial power was in its infancy, he treated his opponents with &s;everity; yet, as &s;oon as that power was confirmed, the tyranny was rather a <HI>nominal,</HI> than a <HI>real</HI> thing; for no tyranni|cal action could be laid to his charge. Nay, &s;uch was the condition of Rome then, that it evidently required a <HI>ma&s;ter</HI>; and Cae&s;ar was no more than <HI>a tender and &s;kilful phy&s;ician, appointed by Providence to heal the di&s;tempers of the &s;tate.</HI> Of cour&s;e the people lamented his death, and were implacably enraged again&s;t his <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Cowley, in his fine Ode to Brutus, brings heavy charges al&s;o again&s;t him, on account of this action; though he &s;eems only to do &s;o, in order to vindicate him from them. But then he does not pretend to defend him, from the facts them&s;elves, ju&s;tifying him only upon the higher principle which had rendered him <HI>guilty</HI> of them.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="465">However, I think that he is &s;everer upon his heroe even than Plutarch, by mentioning that weak and unphilo&s;ophic exclamation of his, where he &s;ays, <HI>he had mi&s;taken virtue for a good, but found it only a name.</HI></P>

<P>This circum&s;tance his Biographer had favourably &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed; and of which Balzac &s;ays,

<P>But though the principle might have been ever &s;o right, in it&s;elf, the action was certainly wrong, in him. There are duties involved in duties, &s;ometimes, which may counteract each other, and thereby ren|der what might be the <HI>virtue</HI> of one per&s;on, the <HI>vice</HI> of another. Many &s;ituations and ca&s;es of this kind may be propo&s;ed; but I &s;hall not launch beyond my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Brutus had many and great obligations to Cae&s;ar. He owed him his life&mdash;nay, 'tis &s;aid, even his <HI>fir&s;t life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar had an amour with Servilia, the mother of Brutus, before his birth.</NOTE>; and had the lives of &s;everal of his friends &s;aved al&s;o at his interce&s;&s;ion. He had ever lived with him in the greate&s;t intimacy, and on the footing of his <HI>fir&s;t friend.</HI> Nay, Cae&s;ar had created him&s;elf enemies, by his partiality towards him, in the preferring him to po&s;ts of profit and honour, which others, from their &s;ervices, were better intitled to. One of the&s;e malecontents was Ca&s;&s;ius, who from that very re|&s;entment became the fir&s;t mover and principal actor in the con&s;piracy. And were all the&s;e obligations to be cancelled by one da&s;h of the <HI>Stoic</HI>'s-<HI>pen?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="466"><HI>Stoical virtues</HI> are not always <HI>moral ones.</HI> Tho&s;e metaphy&s;ical <HI>braveries</HI> (for I was wrong in calling them <HI>virtues</HI>) which exceed the feelings of humanity, have never, as I &s;aid before <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See fir&s;t ob&s;ervation on Scene I.

<P>Moral writers have been di&s;tingui&s;hed into two cla&s;&s;es of philo&s;ophy; whereof one &s;et of them are &s;aid to elevate human nature to the rank of angels, while the other depreciates it to the vilene&s;s of tho&s;e, <HI>who had once been &s;o.</HI> But our author repre&s;ents it more impartially, neither inclining to one &s;ide or the other; for there is not, perhaps, a virtue or a vice in mankind, which he has not pointed out to us, in the &s;everal characters he has occa&s;ionally intro|duced into his general drama. In this Scene he has afforded us an in&s;tance in the latter predicament, by a de&s;cription of that invidiou&s;ne&s;s with which men are apt to regard &s;uperior merit in others; more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e talents, which they are ambitious of &s;hining in them&s;elves.</P>

<P>There is &s;uch an heroic liberality of &s;oul expre&s;&s;ed here, as mu&s;t make one lament the misfortunes of the unhappy Antony, even at this di&s;tance of time&mdash; for the fact here repre&s;ented, is taken from hi&s;torical record.

<Q>Your emperor continues &s;till a Jove.</Q></P>
<P>Antony was not only a braver and a greater, but a better man than his competitor for empire. Augu&s;tus was of a worthle&s;s, mean, jealous, and vengeful nature; though poets, and <HI>&s;ome hi&s;torians,</HI> have deified him. But princes will have their flatterers.

<P>I &s;hall not pretend to di&s;pute a knowledge of human nature with Shake&s;peare, but, if he had not given us a repre&s;entation of this character, I &s;hould hardly have been brought to imagine that a brea&s;t capable of harbouring &s;uch treachery and vilene&s;s, could ever, at the &s;ame time, have contained a &s;pirit of &s;o much honour, and &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame.</P>

<Q><L>You do &s;eem to know</L>

<L>Since doubting things go ill often hurts more,</L>

<P>The nature of the human mind is well &s;hewn here; it pre&s;&s;es &s;till to know the wor&s;t of every ap|prehended evil; though not on account of the argu|ment above propo&s;ed, which is rather ingenious than ju&s;t; but merely to &s;atisfy the impatience, and re|lieve the &s;u&s;pence of doubt. Providence has cer|tainly a de&s;ign, in every kind of impre&s;&s;ion it makes upon its creatures; and the rea&s;on that Imogen gives here, may, perhaps, be its true one, in this ca&s;e: but what I contend for is, That &s;uch a reflection is not the real &s;ource of our curio&s;ity upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.

<P>In the &s;ame Scene, which is a fore&s;t, Imogen, upon reading her mi&s;taken hu&s;band's mandate to Pi&s;anio, requiring him to put her to death, on a pre&s;umption of her having been fal&s;e to his bed, thus exclaims:

What a power of natural &s;entiment mu&s;t a man have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, who could &s;o adequately expre&s;s that kind of ingenuous &s;urprize upon &s;uch a challenge, which none but a woman can po&s;&s;ibly feel! Shake|&s;peare could not only a&s;&s;ume all characters, but even their &s;exes too&mdash;This whole Scene is beautiful, but falls not within our rule to tran&s;cribe any more of it here.

<P>Cre&s;&s;ida's &s;peech here, in reference to her wooer Troilus, contains very ju&s;t reflections and prudent maxims for the conduct of women, in the dangerous circum&s;tance of love.

<P>But as my young Readers might not forgive my pa&s;&s;ing over this Play unnoticed, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the cata&s;trophe of the unhappy lovers &s;eems intended as a kind of moral, as well as poetical ju&s;tice, for their having ventured upon an unweighed engagement together, without the concurrence and con&s;ent of their parents.

He certainly &s;peaks very good &s;en&s;e, throughout, though with the natural and <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> mixture of the old man in it; which, methinks, as Addi&s;on &s;ays of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He wrote a treati&s;e on <HI>health and long life,</HI> at four&s;core, commended in the Spectator, No. 195.</NOTE> &s;tile, is an improvement to it. As to the manner in which he de&s;cribes Hamlet's madne&s;s, in Scene IV. following, I take it to be only de&s;igned by <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> in ridicule of the old pedantic mode of definitions, or quaint di&s;tinctions, in logic and philo&s;ophy; the <HI>categories, predicaments,</HI> and <HI>predi|cables</HI> of the <HI>Schools,</HI> u&s;ed in tho&s;e times.

many in&s;tances of the &s;ame oblique &s;trictures, upon other &s;ubjects, in our Author; I have, therefore, ever thought this character mi&s;taken, and con&s;e|quently mi&s;repre&s;ented on the Stage, by its being generally given to a comic actor.</P>

<P>The famous &s;oliloquy of Hamlet, here, <HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> is &s;o generally remembered, and has been &s;o often remarked upon, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be thought guilty of a neglect, in pa&s;&s;ing it by with|out a comment.

<P><HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> not only affords documents to real life, but &s;upplies them even to the mimic one; as may be &s;een in this Scene, where he makes <HI>Hamlet</HI> give in&s;tructions to Actors how they &s;hould perform their parts. But as there is no moral to be extracted from the pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall not quote it here.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e rules, however excellent in them|&s;elves, may be con&s;idered rather as &s;trictures on bad performers, than precepts for their reformation. Actors, like Poets, mu&s;t be born, not made; and <HI>a receipt to form an Actor,</HI> may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light with the one <HI>to frame an Epic poem.</HI> It is not &s;o much from want of <HI>notion,</HI> as of <HI>Nature,</HI> that &s;o many of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae</HI> are found to be deficient in the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment, and repre|&s;entation of character.</P>
<P><HI>Talents</HI> are as nece&s;&s;ary to Actors, as <HI>Genius</HI> is to Authors; if I may be allowed &s;uch a di&s;tinction of terms&mdash;but neither are to be acquired in the &s;chools.

<HEAD>OTHELLO.</HEAD>
<P>SHAKESPEARE has written three pieces on the &s;ubject of jealou&s;y; the Winter's Tale, Cym|beline, and this one, be&s;ides the character of Ford, in the Merry Wives. But &s;uch was the richne&s;s of his genius, that he has not borrowed a &s;ingle thought, image, or expre&s;&s;ion, from any one of them, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any of the others. The &s;ubject &s;eems rather to have grown progre&s;&s;ively out of it&s;elf, to have in&s;pired its own &s;entiments, and have dictated its own language. This Play, in my opinion, is very ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the la&s;t and greate&s;t effort of our Author's genius, and may, therefore, be looked upon as the <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of dramatic compo&s;ition.</P>

We &s;hould not, with Diogenes, <HI>follow Nature</HI> in the mere animal &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, nor with Zeno fly beyond it, in the metaphy&s;ical one. True

<P>I have before ob&s;erved upon the exuberance of Shake&s;peare's document and moral. He &s;o much abounds in maxim and reflection, that he appears fre|quently at a lo&s;s to find proper characters, through|out even his own exten&s;ive drama, &s;ufficient to parcel them out to; &s;o that he is frequently obliged to make his fools talk &s;en&s;e, and &s;et his knaves a|preaching. An in&s;tance of the latter impropriety may be &s;een in the following pa&s;&s;age, which contains both &s;ound philo&s;ophy, and u&s;eful admonition. But that it may have the better effect on my readers, I wi&s;h that whenever they remember the &s;peech, they could contrive to forget the &s;peaker.</P>

<P>Virtue? a fig. <HI>'Tis in our&s;elves that we are thus, or thus.</HI> Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles, or &s;ow lettuce; &s;et hy&s;&s;op, and weed up thyme; &s;upply it with one gender of herbs, or di&s;tract it with many; either have it &s;terile with idlene&s;s, or manured with in|du&s;try; why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our will. If the ballance of our lives had not one &s;cale of rea&s;on, to poi&s;e another of &s;en&s;uality, the blood and ba&s;ene&s;s of our natures would conduct us to mo&s;t prepo&s;terous conclu&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<P>The plea that Rodorigo offers above, for remaining &s;till under the dominion of a lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, is framed upon a fatal error, too prevalent in the world, that <HI>virtue</HI> is a peculiar gift from Heaven, granted <HI>&s;peciali grati&acirc;,</HI> as it were, to particular and cho&s;en per&s;ons. Hence indolent minds are apt to conclude it a vain ta&s;k to re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ions, or re&s;i&s;t their tempta|tions, without the &s;upernatural aid of &s;uch an innate endowment. Iago, in his reply, rea&s;ons very ju&s;tly again&s;t this dangerous and di&s;couraging doctrine of <HI>partial grace</HI>; in &s;upport of which argument I &s;hall

<HEAD>A GENERAL POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many favourite pa&s;&s;ages in Shake|&s;peare, which mo&s;t of my Readers have got by heart, and mi&s;&s;ing here, may po&s;&s;ibly object to my having neglected to quote or ob&s;erve upon them, in their proper places. But my intention, in this Work, was not to propound the beauties of the Poet, but to expound the document of the Morali&s;t, throughout his writings.</P>
<P>So far from being in&s;en&s;ible to the other excel|lencies of this Author, I have ever thought him by much the greate&s;t poet of our nation, for &s;ub|limity of idea, and beauty of expre&s;&s;ion. Perhaps I may even think my&s;elf guilty of &s;ome inju&s;tice, in limiting his fame within the narrow confines of the&s;e kingdoms; for, upon a compari&s;on with the much venerated names of Antiquity, I am of opi|nion, that we need not &s;urrender the Briti&s;h Palm, either to the Grecian Bay, or the Roman Laurel, with regard to the principal parts of poetry; as thought, &s;entiment, or de&s;cription&mdash;And though the dead languages are confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;uperior to ours, yet even here, in the very article of diction, our Author &s;hall mea&s;ure his pen with any of the antient <HI>&s;tyles,</HI> in their mo&s;t admired compound and decom|pound epithets, de&s;criptive phra&s;es, or figurative expre&s;&s;ions. <HI>The multitudinous &s;ea, ear-piercing fife, big war, giddy ma&s;t, &s;ky-a&s;piring, heaven-ki&s;&s;ing hill, time-honoured name, cloud-capt towers, heavenly-harne&s;&s;ed team, ra&s;h gunpowder, poli&s;hed perturbation, gracious &s;ilence, golden care, trumpet-tongued, thought-executing fires</HI>; with
<PB N="526" REF="527">
a number of other words, both epic and comic, are in&s;tances of it. But with regard to the moral ex|cellencies of our Engli&s;h <HI>Confucius,</HI> either for beauty or number, he undoubtedly challenges the wreath from the whole collective Ho&s;t of Greek or Roman Writers, whether ethic, epic, dramatic, didactic, or hi&s;toric.</P>
<P>Mrs. Montagu &s;ays, very ju&s;tly, that
<Q>We are apt to con&s;ider Shake&s;peare only as a poet; but he is certainly one of the greate&s;t moral philo|&s;ophers that ever lived.</Q>
And this is true; be|cau&s;e, in his univer&s;al &s;cheme of doctrine, he com|prehends manners, proprieties, and decorums; and whatever relates to the&s;e, to per&s;onal character, or national de&s;cription, falls equally within the great line of morals. Horace prefers Homer to all the philo&s;ophers,
<Q><L>Qui, quid &s;it pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</L>
<L>Pleni&ugrave;s et meli&ugrave;s Chry&s;ippo et Crantore dicit.</L></Q>
And &s;urely Shake&s;peare <HI>pleni&ugrave;s et meli&ugrave;s</HI> excels him again, as much as the living &s;cene exceeds the dead letter, as action is preferable to didaction, or repre|&s;entation to declamation.</P>
<P>Example is better than precept. A dramatic moral affords us the benefit of both, at once. Plato wi&s;hed that Virtue could a&s;&s;ume a vi&s;ible form. Dramatic exhibition gives one, both to Virtue and to Vice. The ab&s;tract idea is there materialized. The contra&s;t of character, too, affords an additional &s;trength to the moral; as we are led to love virtue, on a double account, by being made to abhor vice, at the &s;ame time. The dramatic morali&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a manife&s;t advantage over the doctrinal one. Mere de&s;criptions of virtue or vice do not &s;trike us, &s;o &s;trongly, as the vi&s;ible repre&s;entations of them. Richard the Third's dream, Lady Macbeth's &s;oli|loquy in her &s;leep, the Dagger Scene in the &s;ame Play, Cardinal Beaufort's la&s;t moments, with many other pa&s;&s;ages in our Author, of the &s;ame admoni|tory
<PB N="527" REF="528">
kind, avail us more than whole volumes of Tully's Offices, or Seneca's Morals.</P>
<P>In this &s;cenic province of in&s;truction, our repre|&s;entations are much better calculated to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, than tho&s;e of the Antients were, on account of the different hours of exhibition. Theirs were performed in the morning; which circum&s;tance &s;uffered the &s;alutary effect to be worn out of the mind, by the bu&s;ine&s;s or avocations of the day. Ours are at night; the impre&s;&s;ions accompany us to our couch, &s;upply matter for our late&s;t reflec|tions, and may &s;ometimes furni&s;h the &s;ubject of our very dreams.</P>
<P>But Shake&s;peare &s;eems to have extended his views &s;till further; by frequently inter&s;per&s;ing allu&s;ions to the Scriptures, throughout his writings. I would not have the old <HI>My&s;teries</HI> re&s;tored to the Stage, nor &s;hould Dramatic Dialogue exceed into Sermons; but I think, that &s;uch occa&s;ional hints or pa&s;&s;ages, as this Author has &s;upplied, when thrown in &s;paringly, and introduced with di&s;cretion, may &s;ometimes &s;erve to add a &s;trength and dignity to the &s;tile and &s;ubject of &s;uch compo&s;itions; be&s;ides the advantage of pro|ducing, perhaps, effects of an higher nature, by calling our attention to more &s;erious reflections, in the very mid&s;t of our plea&s;ures and di&s;&s;ipations, with|out &s;inking our &s;pirits, or damping our enjoyments; awakening us to the contemplation of a religion &s;o pure, &s;o equally free from the &s;everities of di&s;ci|pline, and the &s;uper&s;titions of devotion; of a &s;y&s;tem of theology, framed even as Man him&s;elf would chu&s;e; in fine, of a faith and doctrine, which has but &s;tronger bound the &s;ocial ties, given an higher &s;anction to moral obligations, and proved our duty to be our intere&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at the la&s;t page of my ta&s;k, I mu&s;t confe&s;s the apprehen&s;ions I am &s;en&s;ible of, on pre&s;enting to the Public a Work of &s;o much diffi|culty and danger: though with regard to the fir&s;t of
<PB N="528" REF="529">
the&s;e articles, I acknowledge this to have been one in the cla&s;s of tho&s;e, of which Ferdinand in the Tempe&s;t &s;ays,
<Q><L>There be &s;ome &s;ports are painful, but their labour</L>
<L>Delight in them &s;ets off.</L></Q>
But in re&s;pect to the latter, I mu&s;t here throw my|&s;elf not only upon the candor, but the indulgence of my Readers; hoping that the many failures in the execution may be pardoned, on the &s;ingle merit of the de&s;ign.</P>
