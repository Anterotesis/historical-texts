</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY day now brought me nearer my freedom, and I was impatient till we proceeded again to &s;ea, that I might have an opportunity of getting a &s;um large enough to purcha&s;e it. I was not long ungratified; for, in the begin|ing of the year 1766, my ma&s;ter bought another &s;loop, named the Nancy, the large&s;t I had ever &s;een. She was partly laden, and was to proceed to Philadel|phia; our Captain had his choice of three, and I was well plea&s;ed he cho&s;e this, which was the large&s;t; for, from his having a large ve&s;&s;el, I had more room, and could carry a larger quantity of goods with me. Accordingly, when we had delivered our old ve&s;&s;el, the Pru|dence, and completed the lading of
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the Nancy, having made near three hundred per cent, by &s;our barrels of pork I brought from Charle&s;town, I laid in as large a cargo as I could, tru&s;ting to God's providence to pro&s;per my un|dertaking. With the&s;e views I &s;ailed for Philadelphia. On our pa&s;&s;age, when we drew near the land, I was for the fir&s;t time &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of &s;ome whales, having never &s;een any &s;uch large &s;ea mon&s;ters before; and as we &s;ailed by the land, one morning I &s;aw a puppy whale clo&s;e by the ve&s;&s;el; it was about the length of a wherry boat, and it &s;ollowed us all the day till we got within the Capes. We arrived &s;afe and in good time at Philadelphia, and I &s;old my goods there chiefly to the quakers. They always appeared to be a very ho|ne&s;t di&s;creet &s;ort of people, and never attempted to impo&s;e on me; I therefore liked them, and ever after cho&s;e to deal
<PB N="4" REF="5">
with them in preference to any others.</P>
<P>One Sunday morning while I was here, as I was going to church, I chanced to pa&s;s a meeting-hou&s;e. The doors being open, and the hou&s;e full of people, it excited my curio&s;ity to go in. When I entered the hou&s;e, to my great &s;ur|pri&s;e, I &s;aw a very tall woman &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of them, &s;peaking in an au|dible voice &s;omething which I could not under&s;tand. Having never &s;een any thing of this kind before, I &s;tood and &s;tared about me for &s;ome time, wondering at this odd &s;cene. As &s;oon as it was over, I took an opportunity to make inquiry about the place and people, when I was informed they were called Quakers. I particularly a&s;ked what that woman I &s;aw in the mid&s;t of them had &s;aid, but none of them were plea&s;ed to &s;atisfy me; &s;o I quitted them, and &s;oon after, as I was returning, I came to a church
<PB N="5" REF="6">
crowded with people; the church-yard was full likewi&s;e, and a number of people were even mounted on ladders, looking in at the windows. I thought this a &s;trange &s;ight, as I had never &s;een churches, either in England or the We&s;t Indies, crowded in this manner before. I therefore made bold to a&s;k &s;ome peo|ple the meaning of all this, and they told me the Rev. Mr. George Whitfield was preaching. I had often heard of this gentleman, and had wi&s;hed to &s;ee and hear him; but I had never before had an opportunity. I now therefore re&s;olved to gratify my&s;elf with the &s;ight, and pre&s;&s;ed in amid&s;t the multitude. When I got into the church I &s;aw this pious man exhorting the people with the greate&s;t fervour and earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;weating as much as I ever did while in &s;lavery on Mont&s;errat beach. I was very much &s;truck and impre&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="6" REF="7">
this; I thought it &s;trange I had never &s;een divines exert them&s;elves in this manner before, and was no longer at a lo&s;s to account for the thin congre|gations they preached to.</P>
<P>When we had di&s;charged our cargo here and were loaded again, we left this fruitful land once more, and &s;et &s;ail for Mont|&s;errat. My traffic had hitherto &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well with me, that I thought, by &s;elling my goods when we arrived at Mont&s;errat, I &s;hould have enough to purcha&s;e my freedom. But as &s;oon as our ve&s;&s;el arrived there, my ma&s;ter came on board, and gave orders for us to go to St. Eu&s;tatia, and di&s;charge our cargo there, and from thence proceed for Georgia. I was much di&s;appointed at this; but thinking, as u&s;ual, it was of no u&s;e to encounter with the decrees of &s;ate, I &s;ubmitted without repining, and we went to St. Eu&s;tatia. After we
<PB N="7" REF="8">
had di&s;charged our cargo there we took in a live cargo, (as we call a cargo of &s;laves.) Here I &s;old my goods tolerably well; but, not being able to lay out all my money in this &s;mall i&s;land to as much advantage as in many other places, I laid out only part, and the re|mainder I brought away with me neat. We &s;ailed from hence for Georgia, and I was glad when we got there, though I had not much rea&s;on to like the place from my la&s;t adventure in Savannah; but I longed to get back to Mont&s;errat and procure my freedom, which I ex|pected to be able to purcha&s;e when I returned. As &s;oon as we arrived here I waited on my careful doctor, Mr. Brady, to whom I made the mo&s;t grate|ful acknowledgments in my power for his former kindne&s;s and attention during my illne&s;s.</P>
<P>While we were here, an odd cir|cum&s;tance happened to the Captain
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and me, which di&s;appointed us both a good deal. A &s;ilver&s;mith, whom we had brought to this place &s;ome voyages be|fore, agreed with the Captain to return with us to the We&s;t Indies, and pro|mi&s;ed at the &s;ame time to give the Captain a great deal of money, having pretended to take a liking to him, and being, as we thought, very rich. But while we &s;tayed to load our ve&s;&s;el this man was taken ill in a hou&s;e where he worked, and in a week's time became very bad. The wor&s;e he grew the more he u&s;ed to &s;peak of giving the Captain what he had promi&s;ed him, &s;o that he expected &s;omething con&s;iderable from the death of this man, who had no wife or child, and he attended him day and night. I u&s;ed al&s;o to go with the Captain, at his own de&s;ire, to attend him; e&s;pecially when we &s;aw there was no appearance of his recovery: and, in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
order to recompen&s;e me for my trouble, the Captain promi&s;ed me ten pounds, when he &s;hould get the man's property. I thought this would be of great &s;ervice to me, although I had nearly money enough to purcha&s;e my freedom, if I &s;hould get &s;afe this voyage to Mont&s;errat. In this expectation I laid out above eight pounds of my money for a &s;uit of &s;uperfine clothes to dance in at my freedom, which I hoped was then at hand. We &s;till continued to attend this man, and were with him even on the la&s;t day he lived, till very late at night, when we went on board. After we were got to bed, about one or two o'clock in the morning, the Captain was &s;ent for, and informed the man was dead. On this he came to my bed, and, wak|ing me, informed me of it, and de&s;ired me to get up and procure a light, and immediately go with him. I told him I
<PB N="10" REF="11">
was very &s;leepy, and wi&s;hed he would take &s;omebody el&s;e with him; or el&s;e, as the man was dead, and could want no farther attendance, to let all things remain as they were till the next morn|ing. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, no,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'we will have the money to-night, I cannot wait till to-morrow; &s;o let us go.'</Q> Accordingly I got up and &s;truck a light, and away we both went and &s;aw the man as dead as we could wi&s;h. The Captain &s;aid he would give him a grand burial, in gra|titude for the promi&s;ed trea&s;ure; and de&s;ired that all the things belonging to the decea&s;ed might be brought forth. Among others, there was a ne&s;t of trunks of which he had kept the keys whil&s;t the man was ill, and when they were produced we opened them with no &s;mall eagerne&s;s and expectation; and as there were a great number within one another, with much impatience we
<PB N="11" REF="12">
took them one out of the other. At la&s;t, when we came to the &s;malle&s;t, and had opened it, we &s;aw it was full of pa|pers, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be notes; at the &s;ight of which our hearts leapt for joy; and that in&s;tant the Captain, clap|ping his hands, cried out, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Thank God, here it is.'</Q> But when we took up the trunk, and began to examine the &s;uppo&s;ed trea&s;ure and long-looked-for bounty, (alas! alas! how uncertain and deceitful are all human affairs!) what had we found? While we thought we were embracing a &s;ub&s;tance we gra&s;ped an empty nothing. The whole amount that was in the ne&s;t of trunks, was only one dollar and a half; and all that the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed would not pay for his co&s;&s;in. Our &s;udden and exqui&s;ite joy was now &s;ucceeded by as &s;udden and exqui|&s;ite pain; and my Captain and I ex|hibited, for &s;ome time, mo&s;t ridiculous
<PB N="12" REF="13">
figures&mdash;pictures of chagrin and di&s;ap|pointment! We went away greatly mor|tified, and left the decea&s;ed to do as well as he could for him&s;elf, as we had taken &s;o good care of him when alive for nothing. We &s;et &s;ail once more for Mont&s;errat, and arrived there &s;afe; but much out of humour with our friend the &s;ilver&s;mith. When we had unladen the ve&s;&s;el, and I had &s;old my venture, find|ing my&s;elf ma&s;ter of about forty-&s;even pounds&mdash;I con&s;ulted my true friend, the Captain, how I &s;hould proceed in offer|ing my ma&s;ter the money for my free|dom. He told me to come on a certain morning, when he and my ma&s;ter would be at breakfa&s;t together. Accordingly, on that morning I went, and met the Captain there, as he had appointed. When I went in I made my obei&s;ance to my ma&s;ter, and with my money in my hand, and many fears in my heart,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
I prayed him to be as good as his offer to me, when he was plea&s;ed to promi&s;e me my freedom as &s;oon as I could pur|cha&s;e it. This &s;peech &s;eemed to con|found him; he began to recoil; and my heart that in&s;tant &s;unk within me. <Q REND="inline">'What,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'give you your free|dom? Why, where did you get the money? Have you got forty-pounds &s;terling?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, &s;ir,'</Q> I an&s;wered. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How did you get it?'</Q> replied he. I told him, very hone&s;tly. The Cap|tain then &s;aid he knew I got the mo|ney very hone&s;tly and with much in|du&s;try, and that I was particularly careful. On which my ma&s;ter replied, I got money much fa&s;ter than he did; and &s;aid he would not have made me the promi&s;e he did if he had thought I &s;hould have got money &s;o &s;oon. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Come, come,'</Q> &s;aid my worthy Captain, clap|ping my ma&s;ter on the back, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Come,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Robert, (which was his name) I think you mu&s;t let him have his free|dom;&mdash;you have laid your money out very well; you have received good intere&s;t for it all this time, and here is now the principal at la&s;t. I know Gu&s;tavas has earned you more than an hundred a-year, and he will &s;till &s;ave you money, as he will not leave you:&mdash;Come, Robert, take the mo|ney.'</Q> My ma&s;ter then &s;aid, he would not be wor&s;e than his promi&s;e; and, taking the money, told me to go to the Secretary at the Regi&s;ter Office, and get my manumi&s;&s;ion drawn up. The&s;e words of my ma&s;ter were like a voice from heaven to me: in an in|&s;tant all my trepidation was turned into unutterable bli&s;s; and I mo&s;t reverently bowed my&s;elf with gratitude, unable to expre&s;s my feelings, but by the over|flowing of my eyes, and a heart replete
<PB N="15" REF="16">
with thanks to God; while my true and worthy friend the Captain, congratu|lated us both with a peculiar degree of heart-felt plea&s;ure. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my joy were over, and that I had expre&s;&s;ed my thanks to the&s;e my worthy friends in the be&s;t manner I was able, I ro&s;e with a heart full of affec|tion and reverence, and left the room, in order to obey my ma&s;ter's joyful mandate of going to the Regi&s;ter Of|fice. As I was leaving the hou&s;e I called to mind the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, in the 126th P&s;alm, and like him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I glorified God in my heart, in whom I tru&s;ted.'</Q> The&s;e words had been im|pre&s;&s;ed on my mind from the very day I was forced from Dept&s;ord to the pre|&s;ent hour, and I now &s;aw them, as I thought, fulfilled and verified. My imagination was all rapture as I flew to the Regi&s;ter Office; and, in this re&s;pect,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
like the apo&s;tle Peter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 9.</NOTE> (who&s;e deliver|ance from pri&s;on was &s;o &s;udden and ex|traordinary, that he thought he was in a vi&s;ion) I could &s;carcely believe I was awake. Heavens! who could do ju&s;|tice to my feelings at this moment! Not conquering heroes them&s;elves, in the mid&s;t of a triumph&mdash;Not the tender mother who has ju&s;t regained her long|lo&s;t infant, and pre&s;&s;es it to her heart&mdash;Not the weary hungry mariner, at the &s;ight of the de&s;ired friendly port&mdash;Not the lover, when he once more embraces his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, after &s;he has been ravi&s;hed from his arms!&mdash;All within my brea&s;t was tumult, wildne&s;s, and delirium! My feet &s;carcely touched the ground, for they were winged with joy, and, like Elijah, as he ro&s;e to Heaven, they <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'were with lightning &s;ped as I went on.'</Q> Every one I met I told of
<PB N="17" REF="18">
my happine&s;s, and blazed about the vir|tue of my amiable ma&s;ter and captain.</P>
<P>When I got to the office and acquaint|ed the Regi&s;ter with my errand, he congratulated me on the occa&s;ion, and told me he would draw up my manu|mi&s;&s;ion for half price, which was a guinea. I thanked him for his kind|ne&s;s; and, having received it and paid him, I ha&s;tened to my ma&s;ter to get him to &s;ign it, that I might be fully relea&s;ed. Accordingly he &s;igned the manumi&s;&s;ion that day; &s;o that, before night, I who had been a &s;lave in the morning, trem|bling at the will of another, was become my own ma&s;ter, and completely free. I thought this was the happie&s;t day I had ever experienced; and my joy was &s;till heightened by the ble&s;&s;ings and prayers of many of the &s;able race, particularly the aged, to whom my heart had ever been attached with reverence.</P>

African &s;tate, I embarked on board the Nancy, after having got all things ready for our voyage. In this &s;tate of &s;erenity we &s;ailed for St. Eu&s;tatia; and having &s;mooth &s;eas and calm weather, we &s;oon arrived there: after taking our cargo on board, we proceeded to Sa|vannah in Georgia, in Augu&s;t, 1766. While we were there, as u&s;ual, I u&s;ed to go for the cargo up the rivers in boats; and on this bu&s;ine&s;s have been fre|quently be&s;et by Alligators, which were very numerous on that coa&s;t; and &s;hot many of them when they have been near getting into our boats; which we have with great difficulty &s;ometimes prevented, and have been very much frightened at them.

<P>During our &s;tay at this place, one evening a &s;lave belonging to Mr.
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Read, a merchant of Savannah, came near our ve&s;&s;el, and began to u&s;e me very ill. I entreated him, with all the patience I was ma&s;ter of, to de&s;i&s;t, as I knew there was little or no law for a free negro here; but the fellow, in&s;tead of taking my advice, per&s;evered in his in&s;ults, and even &s;truck me. At this I lo&s;t all temper, and fell on him and beat him &s;oundly. The next morning his ma&s;ter came to our ve&s;&s;el as we lay along&s;ide the wharf, and de&s;ired me to come a&s;hore that he might have me flogged all round the town, for beating his negro &s;lave. I told him he had in|&s;ulted me, and had given the provo|cation, by fir&s;t &s;triking me. I had told my captain al&s;o the whole affair that morning, and wi&s;hed him to have gone along with me to Mr. Read, to prevent bad con&s;equences; but he &s;aid that it did not &s;ignify, and if Mr. Read &s;aid

any thing he would make matters up, and de&s;ired me to go to work, which I accordingly did. The Captain be|ing on board when Mr. Read came and applied to him to deliver me up, he &s;aid he knew nothing of the matter, I was a free man. I was a&s;toni&s;hed and frightened at this, and thought I had better keep where I was than go a&s;hore and be flogged round the town, with|out judge or jury. I therefore refu&s;ed to &s;tir; and Mr. Read went away, &s;wearing he would bring all the con|&s;tables in the town, for he would have me out of the ve&s;&s;el. When he was gone, I thought his threat might prove too true to my &s;orrow; and I was con|&s;irmed in this belief, as well by the many in&s;tances I had &s;een of the treat|ment of free negroes, as from a fact that had happened within my own knowledge here a &s;hort time before.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
There was a free black man, a car|penter, that I knew, who for a&s;king a gentleman that he worked for, for the money he had earned, was put into gaol; and afterwards this oppre&s;&s;ed man was &s;ent from Georgia, with fal&s;e accu&s;ations, of an intention to &s;et the gentleman's hou&s;e on fire, and run away with his &s;laves. I was therefore much embarra&s;&s;ed, and very apprehen&s;ive of a flogging at lea&s;t. I dreaded, of all things, the thoughts of being &s;triped, as I never in my life had the marks of any violence of that kind. At that in|&s;tant a rage &s;eized my &s;oul, and for a little I determined to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t man that &s;hould offer to lay violent hands on me, or ba&s;ely u&s;e me without a trial; for I would &s;ooner die like a free man, than &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;courged by the hands of ruffians, and my blood drawn like a &s;lave.

more cautious, advi&s;ed me to make ha&s;te and conceal my&s;elf; for they &s;aid Mr. Read was a very &s;piteful man, and he would &s;oon come on board with con|&s;tables and take me. At fir&s;t I refu&s;ed this coun&s;el, being determined to &s;tand my ground; but at length, by the prevailing entreaties of the captain and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged, I went to Mr. Dixon's hou&s;e, which was a little out of town, at a place called <HI>Yea-ma-chra.</HI> I was but ju&s;t gone when Mr. Read, with the con&s;tables, came for me, and &s;earched the ve&s;&s;el; but, not finding me there, he &s;wore he would have me dead or alive. I was &s;ecreted about five days; however, the good character which my captain al|ways gave me as well as &s;ome other gentlemen who al&s;o knew me, procured me &s;ome friends. At la&s;t &s;ome of them told my captain that he did not u&s;e me
<PB N="27" REF="28">
well, in &s;uffering me thus to be impo&s;ed upon, and &s;aid they would &s;ee me re|dre&s;&s;ed, and get me on board &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el. My captain, on this, immedi|ately went to Mr. Read, and told him, that ever &s;ince I eloped from the ve&s;&s;el his work had been neglected, and he could not go on with her loading, him|&s;elf and mate not being well; and, as I had managed things on board for them, my ab&s;ence mu&s;t retard his voyage, and con&s;equently hurt the owner; he therefore begged of him to forgive me, as he &s;aid he never heard any complaint of me before, during the &s;everal years I had been with him. After repeated entreaties, Mr. Read &s;aid I might go to hell, and that he would not meddle with me; on which my captain came immediately to me at his lodging, and, telling me how plea&s;antly matters had gone on, de&s;ired me to go on board.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
Some of my other friends then a&s;ked him if he had got the con&s;table's war|rant from them; the captain &s;aid, No. On this I was de&s;ired by them to &s;tay in the hou&s;e; and they &s;aid they would get me on board of &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el before the evening. When the captain heard this he became almo&s;t di&s;tracted. He went immediately for the warrant, and, after u&s;ing every exertion in his power, he at la&s;t got it from my hunt|ers; but I had all the expences to pay.</P>
<P>After I had thanked all my friends for their kindne&s;s, I went on board again to my work, of which I had always plenty. We were in ha&s;te to complete our lading, and were to carry twenty head of cattle with us to the We&s;t In|dies, where they are a very profitable article. In order to encourage me in working, and to make up for the time I had lo&s;t, my captain promi&s;ed me the privilege of carrying two bullocks of
<PB N="29" REF="30">
my own with me; and this made me work with redoubled ardour. As &s;oon as I had got the ve&s;&s;el loaded, in doing which I was obliged to perform the du|ty of the mate as well as my own work, and that the bullocks were near com|ing on board, I a&s;ked the captain leave to bring my two, according to his pro|mi&s;e; but, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, he told me there was no room for them. I then a&s;ked him to permit me to take one; but he &s;aid he could not. I was a good deal mortified at this u&s;age, and told him I had no notion that he in|tended thus to impo&s;e on me; nor could I think well of any man that was &s;o much wor&s;e than his word. On this we had &s;ome di&s;agreement, and I gave him to under&s;tand, that I intended to leave the ve&s;&s;el. At this he appeared to be very much dejected; and our mate who had been very &s;ickly, and who&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="31">
duty had long devolved upon me, ad|vi&s;ed him to per&s;uade me to &s;tay: in con&s;equence of which he &s;poke very kindly to me, making many fair pro|mi&s;es, telling me, that, as the mate was &s;o &s;ickly, he could not do without me; and that, as the &s;afety of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo depended greatly upon me, he therefore hoped that I would not be offended at what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and &s;wore he would make up all matters when we arrived in the We&s;t Indies; &s;o I con&s;ented to &s;lave on as before. Soon after this, as the bullocks were coming on board, one of them ran at the captain, and butted him &s;o furiou&s;ly in the brea&s;t, that he never recovered of the blow. In order to make me &s;ome amends for his treatment about the bul|locks, the captain now pre&s;&s;ed me very much to take &s;ome turkeys, and other fowls, with me, and gave me liberty to
<PB N="31" REF="32">
take as many as I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> room for: but I told him he knew-very well I had never carried any turkeys before, as I always thought they were &s;uch tender birds that they were not fit to cro&s;s the &s;eas. However, he continued to pre&s;s me to buy them for once; and, what &s;eemed very &s;urpri&s;ing to me, the more I was again&s;t it, the more he urged my taking them, in&s;omuch that he en&s;ured me from all lo&s;&s;es that might happen by them, and I was prevailed on to take them; but I thought this very &s;trange, as he had never acted &s;o with me be|fore. This, and not being able to di&s;|po&s;e of my paper-money in any other way, induced me at length to take four dozen. The turkeys, however, I was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied about that I determined to make no more voyages to this quar|ter, nor with this captain; and was very apprehen&s;ive that my free voyage would be the wor&s;t I had ever made.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
We &s;et &s;ail for Mont&s;errat. The cap|tain and mate had been both complain|ing of &s;ickne&s;s when we &s;ailed, and as we proceeded on our voyage they grew wor&s;e. This was about November, and we had not been long at &s;ea before we began to meet with &s;trong northerly gales and rough &s;eas; and in about &s;even or eight days all the bullocks were near being drowned, and four or five of them died. Our ve&s;&s;el, which had not been tight at fir&s;t, was much le&s;s &s;o now: and, though we were but nine in the whole, including five &s;ailors and my&s;elf, yet we were obliged to at|tend to the pumps every half or three quarters of an hour. The captain and mate came on deck as often as they were able, which was now but &s;eldom; for they declined &s;o fa&s;t' that they were not well enough to make ob&s;ervations above four or five times the whole voyage.
<PB N="33" REF="34">
The whole care of the ve&s;&s;el re&s;ted, therefore upon me, and I was obliged to direct her by mere dint of rea&s;on, not being able to work a traver&s;e. The captain was now very &s;orry he had not taught me navigation, and prote&s;ted, if ever he &s;hould get well again, he would not fail to do &s;o; but in about &s;even|teen days his illne&s;s increa&s;ed &s;o much, that he was obliged to keep his bed, continuing &s;en&s;ible, however, till the la&s;t, con&s;tantly having the owner's in|tere&s;t at heart; for this ju&s;t and bene|volent man ever appeared much con|cerned about the welfare of what he was intru&s;ted with. When this dear friend found the &s;ymptoms of death ap|proaching, he called me by my name; and, when I came to him, he a&s;ked (with almo&s;t his la&s;t breath) if he had ever done me any harm? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'God forbid I &s;hould think &s;o,'</Q> I replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I &s;hould
<PB N="34" REF="35">
then be the mo&s;t ungrateful of wretches to the be&s;t of benefactors.'</Q> While I was thus expre&s;&s;ing my affection and &s;orrow by his bed&s;ide, he expired without &s;ay|ing another word; and the day follow|ing we committed his body to the deep. Every man on board loved him, and regretted his death; but I was exceedingly affected at it, and found that I did not know, till he was gone, the &s;trength of my regard for him. Indeed I had every rea&s;on in the world to be attached to him; for, be|&s;ides that he was in general mild, affa|ble, generous, faithful, benevolent, and ju&s;t, he was to me a friend and father; and had it plea&s;ed Providence, that he had died but five months before, I ve|rily believe I &s;hould not have obtained my freedom when I did; and it is no improbable that I might not have been able to get it at any rate afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
The captain being dead, the mate came on the deck, and made &s;uch ob|&s;ervations as he was able, but to no purpo&s;e. In the cour&s;e of a few days more, the few bullocks that remained were found dead; but the turkies I had, though on the deck, and expo&s;ed to &s;o much wet and bad weather, did well, and I afterwards gained near three hun|dred per cent, on the &s;ale of them; &s;o that in the event it proved a happy circum&s;tance for me that I had not bought the bullocks I intended, for they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with the re&s;t; and I could not help looking on this, otherwi&s;e trifling circum&s;tance, as a particular providence of God, and was thankful accordingly. The care of the ve&s;&s;el took up all my time, and en|gaged my attention entirely. As we were now out of the variable winds, I thought I &s;hould not be much puzzled to
<PB N="36" REF="37">
hit upon the i&s;lands. I was per&s;uaded I &s;teered right for Antigua, which I wi&s;h|ed to reach, as the neare&s;t to us; and in the cour&s;e of nine or ten days we made this i&s;land, to our great joy; and the day after we came &s;afe to Mont&s;errat.</P>
<P>Many were &s;urpri&s;ed when they heard of my conducting the &s;loop into the port, and I now obtained a new ap|pelation, and was called Captain. This elated me not a little, and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus &s;tyled by as high a title as any freeman in this place po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When the death of the captain became known, he was much regretted by all who knew him; for he was a man univer&s;ally re&s;pected. At the &s;ame time the &s;able captain lo&s;t no fame; for the &s;ucce&s;s I had met with increa&s;ed the affection of my friends in no &s;mall mea&s;ure.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>As I had now, by the death of my captain, lo&s;t my great benefactor and friend, I had little inducement to re|main longer in the We&s;t Indies, except my gratitude to Mr. King, which I thought I had pretty well di&s;charged in bringing back his ve&s;&s;el &s;afe, and delivering his cargo to his &s;atisfaction. I began to think of leaving this part of the world, of which I had been long tired, and returning to England, where my heart had always been; but Mr. King &s;till pre&s;&s;ed me very much to &s;tay with his ve&s;&s;el; and he had done &s;o much for me that I found my&s;elf unable to refu&s;e his reque&s;ts, and con|&s;ented to go another voyage to Georgia, as the mate, from his ill &s;tate of health,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
was quite u&s;ele&s;s in the ve&s;&s;el. Accord|ingly a new captain was appointed, who&s;e name was William Phillips, an old acquaintance of mine; and, having refitted our ve&s;&s;el, and taken &s;everal &s;laves on board, we &s;et &s;ail for St. Eu&s;tatia, where we &s;tayed but a few days: and on the 30th of January 1767, we &s;teered for Georgia. Our new cap|tain boa&s;ted &s;trangely of his &s;kill in navigating and conducting a ve&s;&s;el; and in con&s;equence of this he &s;teered a new cour&s;e, &s;everal points more to the we&s;tward than we ever did before; this appeared to me very extraordinary.</P>
<P>On the fourth of February, which was &s;oon after we had got into our new cour&s;e, I dreamt the &s;hip was wrecked amid&s;t the &s;urfs and rocks, and that I was the means of &s;aving every one on board; and on the night following I dreamed the very &s;ame dream. The&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="41">
dreams however made no impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and the next evening, it be|ing my watch below, I was pumping the ve&s;&s;el a little after eight o'clock, ju&s;t before I went off the deck, as is the cu&s;tom; and being weary with the duty of the day, and tired at the pump, (for we made a good deal of water) I began to expre&s;s my impatience, and uttered with an oath, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Damn the ve&s;&s;el's bottom out.'</Q> But my con|&s;cience in&s;tantly &s;mote me for the ex|pre&s;&s;ion. When I left the deck I went to bed, and had &s;carcely fallen a&s;leep when I dreamed the &s;ame dream again about the &s;hip as I had dreamt the two preceeding nights. At twelve o'clock the watch was changed: and, as I had always the charge of the cap|tain's watch, I then went upon deck. At half after one in the morning the man at the helm &s;aw &s;omething under
<PB N="41" REF="42">
the lee-beam that the &s;ea wa&s;hed again&s;t, and he immediately called to me that there was a grampus, and de&s;ired me to look at it. Accordingly I &s;tood up and ob&s;erved it for &s;ome time; but, when I &s;aw the &s;ea wa&s;h up again&s;t it again and again, I &s;aid it was not a fi&s;h but a rock. Being &s;oon certain of this, I went down to the captain, and, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, told him the danger we were in, and de&s;ired him to come upon deck immediately. He &s;aid it was very well, and I went up again. As &s;oon as I was upon deck, the wind, which had been pretty high, having abated a little, the ve&s;&s;el began to be carried &s;ideways towards the rock, by means of the current. Still the captain did not appear. I therefore went to him again, and told him the ve&s;&s;el was then near a large rock, and de&s;ired he would come up with all &s;peed.
<PB N="42" REF="43">
He &s;aid he would, and I returned to the deck. When I was upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> again I &s;aw we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> above a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hot from the rock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> noi&s;e of the breakers all around us. I was exceedingly alarmed at this; and the captain having not yet come on the deck I lo&s;t all patience; and, growing quite enraged, I ran down to him again, and a&s;ked him why he did not come up, and what he could mean by all this? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The breakers,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'are round us, and the ve&s;&s;el is almo&s;t on the rock.'</Q> With that he came on the deck with me, and we tried to put the ve&s;&s;el about, and get her out of the current, but all to no purpo&s;e, the wind being very &s;mall. We then called all hands up immediately; and after a little we got up one end of a cable, and fa&s;t|ened it to the anchor. By this time the &s;urf was foamed round us, and
<PB N="43" REF="44">
made a dreadful noi&s;e on the breakers, and the very moment we let the an|chor go the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck again&s;t the rocks. One &s;well now &s;ucceeded an|other, as it were one wave calling on its fellow: the roaring of the billows increa&s;ed, and, with one &s;ingle heave of the &s;wells, the &s;loop was pierced and transfixed among the rocks! in a mo|ment a &s;cene of horror pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind, &s;uch as I never had con|ceived or experienced before. All my &s;ins &s;tared me in the face; and e&s;pe|cially, I thought that God had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head for cur&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el on which my life depended. My &s;pirits at this for&s;ook me, and I expected every mo|ment to go to the bottom: I deter|mined if I &s;hould &s;till be &s;aved that I would never &s;wear again. And in the mid&s;t of my di&s;tre&s;s, while the dreadful
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&s;urfs were da&s;hing with unremitting fury among the rocks, I remembered the Lord, though fearful that I was unde|&s;erving of forgivene&s;s, and I thought that as he had often delivered he might yet deliver; and, calling to mind the many mercies he had &s;hewn me in times pa&s;t, they gave me &s;ome &s;mall hope that he might &s;till help me. I then began to think how we might be faved; and I believe no mind was ever like mine &s;o replete with inventions and confu&s;ed with &s;chemes, though how to e&s;cape death I knew not. The captain immediately ordered the hatches to be nailed down on the &s;laves in the hold, where there were above twenty, all of whom mu&s;t unavoidably have pe|ri&s;hed if he had been obeyed. When he de&s;ired the man to nail down the hatches I thought that my &s;in was the cau&s;e of this, and that God would
<PB N="45" REF="46">
charge me with the&s;e people's blood. This thought ru&s;hed upon my mind that in&s;tant with &s;uch violence, that it quite overpowered me, and I fainted. I recovered ju&s;t as the people were about to nail down the hatches; per|ceiving which, I de&s;ired them to &s;top. The captain then &s;aid it mu&s;t be done: I a&s;ked him why? He &s;aid that every one would endeavour to get into the boat, which was but &s;mall, and thereby we &s;hould be drowned; for it would not have carried above ten at the mo&s;t. I could no longer re&s;train my emotion, and I told him he de&s;erved drowning for not knowing how to navigate the ve&s;&s;el; and I believe the people would have to&s;&s;ed him overboard if I had given them the lea&s;t hint of it. How|ever the hatches were not nailed down; and, as none of us could leave the ve&s;&s;el then on account of the darkne&s;s,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
and as we knew not where to go, and were convinced be&s;ides that the boat could not &s;urvive the &s;urfs, we all &s;aid we would remain on the dry part of the ve&s;&s;el, and tru&s;t to God till day|light appeared, when we &s;hould know better what to do.</P>
<P>I then advi&s;ed to get the boat pre|pared again&s;t morning, and &s;ome of us began to &s;et about it; but others aban|doned all care of the &s;hip and them|&s;elves, and fell to drinking. Our boat had a piece out of her bottom near two feet long, and we had no mate|rials to mend her; however, nece&s;&s;ity being the mother of invention, I took &s;ome pump leather and nailed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the broken part, and pla&s;tered it ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> with tallow-grea&s;e. And, thus prepar+ed, with the utmo&s;t anxiety of min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> we watched for day-light, and thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> every minute an hour till it appeare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="47" REF="48">
At la&s;t it &s;aluted our longing eyes, and kind Providence accompanied its approach with what was no &s;mall comfort to us; for the dreadful &s;wells began to &s;ub&s;ide; and the next thing that we di&s;covered to rai&s;e our droop|ing &s;pirits, was a &s;mall key or de&s;olate i&s;land, about five or &s;ix miles off; but a barrier &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf; for there was not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs, and this threw us again into a &s;ad con&s;ternation; but there was no alternative, we were therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once; and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, all of us were frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of getting out to drag and lift it over the reefs. This co&s;t us much labour and fatigue; and, what was yet more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, we could not avoid having our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks. There were only four peo|ple
<PB N="48" REF="49">
that would work with me at the oars; and they con&s;i&s;ted of three black men and a Dutch creole &s;ailor; and, though we went with the boat five times that day, we had no others to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. But, had we not worked in this manner, I really believe the peo|ple could not have been &s;aved; for not one of the white men did any thing to pre&s;erve their lives; indeed they &s;oon got &s;o drunk that they were not able, but lay about the deck like &s;wine, &s;o that we were at la&s;t obliged to lift them into the boat and carry them on &s;hore by force. This want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance made our labour intolerably &s;evere; in&s;omuch, that, by going on &s;hore &s;o often that day, the &s;kin was partly &s;tript off my hands.</P>
<P>However we continued all the day to toil and &s;train our exertions, till we had brought all on board &s;afe to the
<PB N="49" REF="50">
&s;hore; &s;o that out of thirty-two people we lo&s;t not one.</P>
<P>My dream now returned upon my mind with all its force; it was ful|filled in every part; for our danger was the &s;ame I had dreamt of; and I could not help looking on my|&s;elf as the principal in&s;trument in ef|fecting our deliverance: for, owing to &s;ome of our people getting drunk, the re&s;t of us were obliged to double our exertions; and it was fortunate we did, for in a very little time longer the patch of leather on the boat would have been worn out, and &s;he would have been no longer fit for &s;ervice. Situated as we were, who could think that men &s;hould be &s;o carele&s;s of the danger they were in? for, if the wind had but rai&s;ed the &s;well as it was when the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck, we mu&s;t have bid a final farewel to all hopes of deliver|ance; and though, I warned the peo|ple
<PB N="50" REF="51">
who were drinking, and entreated them to embrace the moment of de|liverance, neverthele&s;s they per&s;i&s;ted, as if not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lea&s;t &s;park of rea&s;on. I could not help thinking, that, if any of the&s;e people had been lo&s;t, God would charge me with their lives, which, perhaps, was one cau&s;e of my labouring &s;o hard for their pre&s;ervation, and indeed every one of them afterwards &s;eemed &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ervice I had rendered them, that while we were on the key I was a kind of chieftian among&s;t them. I brought &s;ome limes, oranges, and lemons a|&s;hore; and, finding it to be a good &s;oil where we were, I planted &s;everal of them as a token to any one that might be ca&s;t away hereafter. This key, as we afterwards found, was one of the Bahama i&s;lands, which con&s;i&s;t of a clu&s;ter of large i&s;lands, with
<PB N="51" REF="52">
&s;maller ones or keys, as they are called, inter&s;per&s;ed among them. It was about a mile in circumference, with a white &s;andy beach running in a regular order along it. On that part of it where we fir&s;t attempted to land there &s;tood &s;ome very large birds, called &s;lamin|goes: the&s;e, from the reflection of the &s;un, appeared to us at a little di&s;|tance as large as men; and, when they walked backwards and forwards, we could not conceive what they were: our captain &s;wore they were cannibals. This created a great panic among us; and we held a con&s;ultation how to act. The captain wanted to go to a key that was within &s;ight, but a great way off; but I was again&s;t it, as in &s;o doing we &s;hould not be able to &s;ave all the people; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And therefore,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'let us go on &s;hore here, and perhaps the&s;e cannibals may take to the water.'</Q>
<PB N="52" REF="53">
Accordingly we &s;teered toward them; and when we approached them, to our very great joy and no le&s;s wonder, they walked off one after the other very de|liberately; and at la&s;t they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears. About the key there were turtles and &s;everal &s;orts of fi&s;h in &s;uch abundance that we caught them without bait, which was a great relief to us after the &s;alt provi&s;ions on board. There was al&s;o a large rock on the beach, about ten feet high, which was in the form of a punch-bowl at the top; this we could not help thinking Providence had ordained to &s;upply us with rain+water; and it was &s;omething &s;ingula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that, if we did not take the water when it rained, in &s;ome little time after i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> would turn as &s;alt as &s;ea-water.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t care, after refre&s;hmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to make our&s;elves tents to lodge in
<PB N="53" REF="54">
which we did as well as we could with &s;ome &s;ails we had brought from the &s;hip. We then began to think how we might get from this place, which was quite uninhabited; and we deter|mined to repair our boat, which was very much &s;hattered, and to put to &s;ea in que&s;t of a &s;hip or &s;ome inhabited i&s;land. It took us up however eleven days before we could get the boat ready for &s;ea in the manner we wanted it, with a &s;ail and other nece&s;&s;aries. When we had got all things prepared, the captain wanted me to &s;tay on &s;hore while he went to &s;ea in que&s;t of a ve&s;|&s;el to take all the people off the key; but this I refu&s;ed; and the captain and my&s;elf, with five more, &s;et off in the boat towards New Providence. We had no more than two mu&s;ket load of gun-powder with us if any thing &s;hould happen; and our &s;tock of provi&s;ions
<PB N="54" REF="55">
con&s;i&s;ted of three gallons of rum, four of water, &s;ome &s;alt beef, &s;ome bi&s;cuit; and in this manner we proceeded to &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of our voyage, we came to an i&s;land called Abbico, the large&s;t of the Bahama i&s;lands. We were much in want of water; for by this time our water was expended, and we were exceedingly fatigued in pulling two days in the heat of the &s;un; and it being late in the evening, we hauled the boat a&s;hore to try for water and remain during the night: when we came a&s;hore we &s;earched for water, but could find none. When it was dark, we made a fire around us for fear of the wild bea&s;ts, as the place was an entire thick wood, and we took it by turns to watch. In this &s;ituation we found very little re&s;t, and waited with impatience for the morning. As
<PB N="55" REF="56">
&s;oon as the light appeared we &s;et off again with our boat, in hopes of find|ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance during the day. We were now much dejected and weakened by pulling the boat; for our &s;ail was of no u&s;e, and we were almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of fre&s;h water to drink. We had nothing left to eat but &s;alt beef, and that we could not u&s;e without water. In this &s;ituation we toiled all day in &s;ight of the i&s;land, which was very long; in the evening, &s;eeing no relief, we made &s;hore again, and fa&s;tened our boat. We then went to look for fre&s;h water, being quite faint for the want of it; and we dug and &s;earched about for &s;ome all the remainder of the even|ing, but could not find one drop, &s;o that our dejection at this period became exce&s;&s;ive, and our terror &s;o great, that we expected nothing but death to de|liver us. We could not touch our
<PB N="56" REF="57">
beef, which was &s;alt as brine, with|out fre&s;h water; and we were in the greate&s;t terror from the apprehen&s;ion of wild bea&s;ts. When unwelcome night came we acted as on the night before; and the next morning we &s;et off again from the i&s;land in hopes of &s;eeing &s;ome ve&s;&s;el. In this manner we toiled as well as we were able till four o'clock, during which we pa&s;&s;ed &s;eve|ral keys, but could not meet with a &s;hip; and, &s;till fami&s;hing with thir&s;t, went a&s;hore on one of tho&s;e keys again in hopes of finding &s;ome water. Here we found &s;ome leaves with a few drops of water in them, which we lapped with much eagerne&s;s; we then dug in &s;everal places, but without &s;ucce&s;s. As we were digging holes in &s;earch of water there came forth &s;ome very thick and black &s;tuff; but none of us could touch it, except the poor Dutch Cre|Creole,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if had been wine. We tried to catch fi&s;h, but could not; and we now began to repine at our fate, and abandon our&s;elves to de&s;pair; when, in the mid&s;t of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A &s;ail! a &s;ail! a &s;ail!'</Q> This gladdening &s;ound was like a reprieve to a con|vict, and we all in&s;tantly turned to look at it; but in a little time &s;ome of us began to be afraid it was not a &s;ail. However, at a venture, we embarked and &s;teered after it; and, in half an hour to our un&s;peakable joy, we plainly &s;aw that it was a ve&s;&s;el. At this our drooping &s;pirits revived, and we made towards her with all the &s;peed ima|ginable. When we came near to her, we found &s;he was a little &s;loop about the &s;ize of a Grave&s;end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and quite full or people; a circum&s;tance which
<PB N="58" REF="59">
we could not make out the meaning of. Our captain, who was a Welch|man, &s;wore that they were pirates, and would kill us. I &s;aid, be that as it might, we mu&s;t board her if we were to die by it; and, if they &s;hould not receive us kindly, we mu&s;t oppo&s;e them as well as we could; for there was no alternative between their pe|ri&s;hing and ours. This coun&s;el was immediately taken; and I really be|lieve that the captain, my&s;elf, and the Dutchman, would then have faced twenty men. We had two cutla&s;&s;es and a mu&s;quet, that I brought in the boat; and in this &s;ituation, we rowed along&s;ide, and immediately boarded her. I believe there were about forty hands on board; but how great was our &s;urpri&s;e, as &s;oon as we got on board, to find that the major part of
<PB N="59" REF="60">
them were in the &s;ame predicament as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>They belonged to a whaling &s;choo|ner that was wrecked two days before us about nine miles to the north of our ve&s;&s;el. When &s;he was wrecked &s;ome of them had taken to their boats and had left &s;ome of their people and property on a key, in the &s;ame manner as we had done; and were going, like us, to New Providence in que&s;t of a &s;hip, when they met with this little &s;loop, called a wrecker; their employ|ment in tho&s;e &s;eas being to look after wrecks. They were then going to take the remainder of the people be|longing to the &s;chooner; for which the wrecker was to have all things be|longing to the ve&s;&s;el, and likewi&s;e their people's help to get what they could out of her, and were then to carry the crew to New Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
We told the people of the wrecker the condition of our ve&s;&s;el, and we made the &s;ame agreement with them as the &s;chooner's people; and, on their complying, we begged of them to go to our key directly, becau&s;e our people were in want of water. They agreed, therefore, to go along with us fir&s;t; and in two days we arrived at the key, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the people that we had left behind, as they had been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our ab&s;ence. Luckily for us, the wrecker had now more people on board than &s;he could carry or vic|tual for any moderate length of time; they therefore hired the &s;chooner's people to work on the wreck, and we left them our boat, and embarked for New Providence.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more for|tunate than our meeting with this
<PB N="61" REF="62">
wrecker, for New Providence was at &s;uch a di&s;tance that we never could have reached it in our boat. The i&s;land of Abbico was much longer than we expected; and it was not till after &s;ailing for three or four days that we got &s;afe to the farther end of it, towards New Providence. When we arrived there we watered, and got a good many lob&s;ters and other &s;hell|fi&s;h; which proved a great relief to us, as our provi&s;ions and water were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. We then proceeded on our voyage; but the day after we left the I&s;land, late in the evening, and whil&s;t we were yet among&s;t the Bahama keys, we were overtaken by a vio|lent gale of wind, &s;o that we were obliged to cut away the ma&s;t. The ve&s;&s;el was very near foundering; for &s;he parted from her anchors, and &s;truck &s;everal times on the
<PB N="62" REF="63">
&s;hoals. Here we expected every mi|nute that &s;he would have gone to pieces, and each moment to be our la&s;t; &s;o much &s;o, that my old captain and &s;ickly u&s;ele&s;s mate, and &s;everal others, fainted; and death &s;tared us in the face on every &s;ide. All the &s;wearers on board now began to call on the God of Heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: and, &s;ure enough, beyond our compre|hen&s;ion he did a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and in a mira|culous manner delivered us! In the very height of our extremity the wind lulled for a few minutes; and, although the &s;well was high beyond expre&s;&s;ion, two men, who were expert &s;wimmers, attempted to go to the buoy of the an|chor, which we &s;till &s;aw on the water, at &s;ome di&s;tance, in a little punt that belonged to the wrecker, which was not large enough to carry more than two. She filled at different times in their
<PB N="63" REF="64">
endeavours to get into her along&s;ide of our ve&s;&s;el; and they &s;aw nothing but death before them, as well as we; but they &s;aid they might as well die that way as any other. A coil of very &s;mall rope, with a little buoy, was put in along with them; and, at la&s;t, with great hazard, they got the punt clear from the ve&s;&s;el; and the&s;e two intrepid water heroes paddled away for life to|wards the buoy of the anchor. Our eyes were fixed on them all the time, expecting every minute to be their la&s;t: and the prayers of all tho&s;e that remained in their &s;en&s;es were of|fered up to God, on their behalf, for a &s;peedy deliverance, and for our own, which depended on them; and he heard and an&s;wered us! The&s;e two men at la&s;t reached the buoy; and, having fa&s;tened the punt to it, they tied one end of their rope to the &s;mall buoy
<PB N="64" REF="65">
that they had in the punt, and &s;ent it adrift towards the ve&s;&s;el. We on board ob&s;erving this threw out boat-hooks and leads fa&s;tened to lines, in order to catch the buoy: at la&s;t we caught it, and fa&s;tened a haw&s;er to the end of the &s;mall rope; we then gave them a &s;ign to pull, and they pulled the haw&s;er to them, and fa&s;tened it to the buoy: which being done we hauled for our lives; and, through the mercy of God, we got again from the &s;hoals into deep water, and the punt got &s;afe to the ve&s;&s;el. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any to conceive our heart-felt joy at this &s;econd deliverance from ruin, but tho&s;e who have &s;uffered the &s;ame hard&s;hips. Tho&s;e who&s;e &s;trength and &s;en&s;es were gone, came to them&s;elves, and were now as elated as they were before depre&s;&s;ed. Two days after this the wind cea&s;ed, and the water became &s;mooth. The punt
<PB N="65" REF="66">
then went on &s;hore, and we cut down &s;ome trees; and having found our ma&s;t and mended it we brought it on board, and fixed it up. As &s;oon as we had done this we got up the anchor, and away we went once more for New Providence, which in three days more we reached &s;afe, after having been above three weeks in a &s;ituation in which we did not expect to e&s;cape with life. The inhabitants here were very kind to us; and, when they learned our &s;ituation, &s;hewed us a great deal of ho&s;pitality and friend&s;hip. Soon after this every one of my old fellow-&s;uf|ferers that were free parted from us, and &s;haped their cour&s;e where their inclination led them. One merchant, who had a large &s;loop, &s;eeing our con|dition, and knowing we wanted to go to Georgia, told four of us that his ve&s;&s;el was going there; and, if we
<PB N="66" REF="67">
would work on board and load her, he would give us our pa&s;&s;age free. As we could not get any wages whatever, and &s;ound it very hard to get off the place, we were obliged to con&s;ent to his propo&s;al; and we went on board and helped to load the &s;loop, though we had only our victuals allowed us. When &s;he was entirely loaded, he told us &s;he was going to Jamaica fir&s;t, where we mu&s;t go if we went in her. This, however, I refu&s;ed; but my fellow-&s;ufferers not having any mo|ney to help them&s;elves with, nece&s;&s;ity obliged them to accept of the offer, and to &s;teer that cour&s;e, though they did not like it.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed in New Providence about &s;eventeen or eighteen days; during which time I met with many friends, who gave me encouragement to &s;tay there with them, but I declined it;
<PB N="67" REF="68">
though, had not my heart been fixed on England, I &s;hould have &s;tayed, as I liked the place extremely, and there were &s;ome free black people here who were very happy, and we pa&s;&s;ed our time plea&s;antly together, with the me|lodious &s;ound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees. At length Captain Phillips hired a &s;loop to carry him and &s;ome of the &s;laves that he could not &s;ell to Georgia; and I agreed to go with him in this ve&s;&s;el, meaning now to take my farewel of that place. When the ve&s;&s;el was ready we all em|barked; and I took my leave of New Providence, not without regret. We &s;ailed about four o'clock the morn|ing with a fair wind, for Georgia; and about eleven o'clock the &s;ame morn|ing, a &s;udden and &s;hort gale &s;prung up and blew away mo&s;t of our fails; and, as we were &s;till among the keys, in
<PB N="68" REF="69">
a very few minutes it da&s;hed the &s;loop again&s;t the rocks. Luckily for us the water was deep; and the &s;ea was not &s;o angry, but that, after having for &s;ome time laboured hard, and being many in number, we were &s;aved, through God's mercy: and, by u&s;ing our greate&s;t exertions, we got the ve&s;|&s;el off. The next day we returned to Providence, where we &s;oon got her again refitted. Some of the people &s;wore that we had &s;pells &s;et upon us by &s;omebody in Mont&s;errat; and others that we had witches and wizzards among&s;t the poor helple&s;s &s;laves; and that we never &s;hould arrive &s;afe at Georgia. But the&s;e things did not de|ter me; I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Let us again face the winds and &s;eas, and &s;wear not, but tru&s;t to God, and he will deliver us.'</Q> We therefore once more &s;et &s;ail; and,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
with hard labour in &s;even days time arrived &s;afe at Georgia.</P>
<P>After our arrival we went up to the town of Savannah; and the &s;ame even|ing I went to a friend's hou&s;e to lodge, who&s;e name was Mo&s;a, a black man. We were very happy at meeting each other; and after &s;upper we had a light till it was between nine and ten o'clock at night. About that time the watch or patrol came by; and, di&s;cerning a light in the hou&s;e, they knocked at the door: we opened it; and they came in and &s;at down and drank &s;ome punch with us: they al&s;o begged &s;ome limes of me, as they under&s;tood I had &s;ome, which I readily gave them. A little after this they told me I mu&s;t go to the watch-hou&s;e with them: this &s;urpri&s;ed me a good deal, after our kindne&s;s to them; and I a&s;ked them, Why &s;o? They &s;aid that all negroes who had a
<PB N="70" REF="71">
light in their hou&s;es after nine o'clock were to be taken into cu&s;tody, and either pay &s;ome dollars or be flogged. Some of tho&s;e people knew that I was a free man; but, as the man of the hou&s;e was not free, and had his ma&s;ter to protect him, they did not take the &s;ame liberty with him they did with me. I told them that I was a free man, and ju&s;t arrived from Providence; that we were not making any noi&s;e, and that I was not a &s;tranger in that place, but was very well known there: <Q REND="inline">'Be&s;ides,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what will you do with me?'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That you &s;hall &s;ee,'</Q> re|plied they, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'but you mu&s;t go to the watch-hou&s;e with us.'</Q> Now whether they meant to get money from me or not I was at a lo&s;s to know; but I thought immediately of the oranges and limes at Santa Cruz: and &s;eeing that nothing would pacify them I went
<PB N="71" REF="72">
with them to the watch-hou&s;e, where I remained during the night. Early the next morning the&s;e impo&s;ing ruffians flogged a negro-man and woman that they had in the watch-hou&s;e, and then they told me that I mu&s;t be flogged too. I a&s;ked why? and if there was no law for free men? and told them if there was I would have it put in force again&s;t them. But this only exa&s;perated them the more, and in|&s;tantly &s;wore they would &s;erve me as Doctor Perkins had done; and were going to lay violent hands on me; when one of them, more humane than the re&s;t, &s;aid that as I was a free man they could not ju&s;tify &s;tripping me by law. I then immediately &s;ent for Doctor Brady, who was known to be an hone&s;t and worthy man; and on his coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance they let me go.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
This was not the only di&s;agreeable incident I met with while I was in this place; for, one day, while I was a little way out of the town of Savannah, I was be&s;et by two white men, who meant to play their u&s;ual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping. As &s;oon as the&s;e men acco&s;ted me, one of them &s;aid to the other, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This is the very fel|low we are looking for, that you lo&s;t:'</Q> and the other &s;wore immediately that I was the identical per&s;on. On this they made up to me, and were about to handle me; but I told them to be &s;till and keep off; for I had &s;een tho&s;e kind of tricks played upon other free blacks, and they mu&s;t not think to &s;erve me &s;o. At this they pau&s;ed a little, and one &s;aid to the other&mdash;it will not do; and the other an&s;wered that I talked two good Engli&s;h. I replied, I be|lieved I did; and I had al&s;o with me a
<PB N="73" REF="74">
revengeful &s;tick equal to the occa&s;ion; and my mind was likewi&s;e good. Hap|pily however it was not u&s;ed; and, after we had talked together a little in this manner, the rogues left me.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed in Savannah &s;ome time, anxi|ou&s;ly trying to get to Mont&s;errat once more to &s;ee Mr. King, my old ma&s;ter, and then to take a final farewel of the American quarter of the globe. At la&s;t I met with a &s;loop called the Speed|well, Captain John Bunton, which be|longed to Grenada, and was bound to Martinico, a French i&s;land, with a cargo of rice, and I &s;hipped my&s;elf on board of her.</P>
<P>Before I left Georgia, a black woman who had a child lying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial &s;ervice, and not able to get any white per&s;on to perform it, applied to me for that purpo&s;e. I told her I was no par&s;on;
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and be&s;ides, that the &s;ervice over the dead did not affect the &s;oul. This however did not &s;atisfy her; &s;he &s;till urged me very hard: I therefore com|plied with her earne&s;t entreaties, and at la&s;t con&s;ented to act the par&s;on for the &s;ir&s;t time in my life. As &s;he was much re&s;pected, there was a great com|pany both of white and black people at the grave.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I THUS took a final leave of Georgia; for the treatment I had received in it
<PB N="76" REF="77">
di&s;gu&s;ted me very much again&s;t the place; and when I left it and &s;ailed for Martinico I determined never more to revi&s;it it. My new captain conducted his ve&s;&s;el &s;afer than my former one; and, after an agreeable voyage, we got &s;afe to our intended port. While I was on this i&s;land I went about a good deal, and found it very plea&s;ant: in parti|cular I admired the town of St. Pierre, which is the principal one in the i&s;land, and built more like an European town than any I had &s;een in the We&s;t Indies. In general al&s;o, &s;laves were better treated, had more holidays, and looked better than tho&s;e in the Engli&s;h i&s;lands. After we had done our bu|&s;ine&s;s here, I wanted my di&s;charge, which was nece&s;&s;ary; for it was then the month of May, and I wi&s;hed much to be at Mont&s;errat to bid farewel to Mr. King, and all my
<PB N="77" REF="78">
other friends there, in time to &s;ail for Old England in the July fleet. But, alas! I had put a great &s;tumbling block in my own way, by which I was near lo&s;ing my pa&s;&s;age that &s;ea&s;on to Eng|land. I had lent my captain &s;ome money, which I now wanted to enable me to pro&s;ecute my intentions. This I told him; but when I applied for it, though I urged the nece&s;&s;ity of my occa&s;ion, I met with &s;o much &s;huffling from him, that I began at la&s;t to be afraid of lo&s;ing my money, as I could not recover it by law; for I have already mentioned, that throughout the We&s;t Indies no black man's te&s;timony is admitted, on any occa&s;ion, again&s;t any white per&s;on whatever, and there|fore my own oath would have been of no u&s;e. I was obliged, therefore, to remain with him till he might be di&s;|po&s;ed to return it to me. Thus we
<PB N="78" REF="79">
&s;ailed from Martinico for the Grenades. I frequently pre&s;&s;ing the captain for my money to no purpo&s;e; and, to render my condition wor&s;e, when we got there, the captain and his owners quar|relled; &s;o that my &s;ituation became daily more irk&s;ome: for be&s;ides that we on board had little or no victuals allowed us, and I could not get my money nor wages, as I could then have gotten my pa&s;&s;age free to Mont&s;errat had I been able to accept it. The wor&s;t of all was, that it was growing late in July, and the &s;hips in the i&s;lands mu&s;t &s;ail by the 26th of that month. At la&s;t, however, with a great many en|treaties, I got my money from the captain, and took the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el I could meet with for St Eu&s;tatia. From thence I went in another to Ba&s;&s;eterre in St. Kitts, where I arrived on the 19th of July. On the 22d, having met with a
<PB N="79" REF="80">
ve&s;&s;el bound to Mont&s;errat, I wanted to go in her; but the captain and others would not take me on board until I &s;hould adverti&s;e my&s;elf, and give notice of my going off the i&s;land. I told them of my ha&s;te to be in Mont&s;errat, and that the time then would not admit of adverti&s;ing, it being late in the even|ing, and the ve&s;&s;el about to &s;ail; but he in&s;i&s;ted it was nece&s;&s;ary, and other|wi&s;e he &s;aid he would not take me. This reduced me to great perplexity; for if I &s;hould be compelled to &s;ubmit to this degrading nece&s;&s;ity, which every black freeman is under, of adverti&s;ing him&s;elf like a &s;lave, when he leaves an i&s;land, and which I thought a gro&s;s im|po&s;ition upon any freeman, I feared I &s;hould mi&s;s that opportunity of going to Mont&s;errat, and then I could not get to England that year. The ve&s;&s;el was ju&s;t going off, and no time could be lo&s;t;
<PB N="80" REF="81">
I immediately therefore &s;et about, with a heavy heart, to try who I could get to befriend me in complying with the de|mands of the captain. Luckily I found, in a few minutes, &s;ome gentlemen of Mont&s;errat whom I knew; and, hav|ing told them my &s;ituation, I reque&s;ted their friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance in helping me off the i&s;land. Some of them, on this, went with me to the captain, and &s;atis|fied him of my freedom; and, to my very great joy, he de&s;ired me to go on board. We then &s;et &s;ail, and the next day, 23d, I arrived at the wi&s;hed-for place, after an ab&s;ence of &s;ix months, in which I had more than once experi|enced the delivering hand of Provi|dence, when all human means of e&s;cap|ing de&s;truction &s;eemed hopele&s;s. I &s;aw my friends with a gladne&s;s of heart which was increa&s;ed by my ab&s;ence and the dangers I had e&s;caped, and I was received with great friend&s;hip by
<PB N="81" REF="82">
them all, but particularly by Mr. King, to whom I related the fate of his floop, the Nancy, and the cau&s;es of her being wrecked. I now learned with extreme &s;orrow, that his hou&s;e was wa&s;hed away during my ab&s;ence, by the bur&s;ting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was oppo&s;ite the town of Plymouth. It &s;wept great part of the town away, and Mr. King lo&s;t a great deal of property from the inundation, and nearly his life. When I told him I intended to go to London that &s;ea&s;on, and that I had come to vi&s;it him before my departure, the good man expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of affection for me, and &s;orrow that I &s;hould leave him, and warmly advi&s;ed me to &s;tay there; in&s;i&s;ting, as I was much re&s;pected by all the gentlemen in the place, that I might do very well, and in a &s;hort time have land and &s;laves of my own. I thanked him for this
<PB N="82" REF="83">
in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip; but, as I wi&s;hed very much to be in London, I declined remaining any longer there, and begged he would excu&s;e me. I then reque&s;ted he would be kind enough to give me a certificate of my behavi|our while in his &s;ervice, which he very readily comp ied with, and gave me the following:</P>

<P>Having obtained this, I parted from my kind ma&s;ter, after many &s;incere profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude and regard,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
and prepared for my departure for Lon|don. I immediately agreed to go with one Capt. John Hamer, for &s;even gui|neas (the pa&s;&s;age to London) on board a &s;hip called, the Andromache; and on the 24th and 25th, I had free dances, as they are called, with &s;ome of my countrymen, previous to my &s;eeting off; after which I took leave of all my friends, and on the 26th I embarked for London, exceedingly glad to &s;ee my&s;elf once more on board of a &s;hip; and &s;till more &s;o, in &s;teering the cour&s;e I had long wi&s;hed for. With a light heart I bade Mont&s;errat farewell, and never had my feet on it &s;ince; and with it I bade adieu to the &s;ound of the cruel whip, and all other dreadful in&s;truments of torture; adieu to the offen&s;ive &s;ight of the violated cha&s;tity of the &s;able females, which has too often acco&s;ted my eyes; adieu to oppre&s;&s;ions (although
<PB N="84" REF="85">
to me le&s;s &s;evere than mo&s;t of my countrymen); and adieu to the angry howling, da&s;hing &s;urfs. I wi&s;hed for a grateful and thankful heart to prai&s;e the Lord God on high for all his mercies! in this exta&s;y I &s;teered the &s;hip all night.</P>
<P>We had a mo&s;t pro&s;perous voyage, and, at the end of &s;even weeks, arrived at Cherry-Garden &s;tairs. Thus were my longing eyes once more gratified with a &s;ight of London, after having been ab&s;ent from it above four years. I immediately received my wages, and I never had earned &s;even guineas &s;o quick in my life before; I had thirty-&s;even guineas in all, when I got cleared of the &s;hip. I now entered upon a &s;cene quite new to me, but full of hope. In this &s;ituation my fir&s;t thoughts were to look out for &s;ome of my former friends, and among&s;t the fir&s;t of tho&s;e were the Mi&s;s Guerins. As&s;oon, there|fore, as I had regaled my&s;elf I went in
<PB N="85" REF="86">
que&s;t of tho&s;e kind ladies, whom I was very impatient to &s;ee; and with &s;ome difficulty and per&s;everance, I found them at May's-hill, Greenwich. They were mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting with them. I told them my hi&s;tory, at which they expre&s;&s;ed great wonder, and freely acknowledged it did their cou&s;in, Capt. Pa&s;cal, no honour. He then vi&s;ited there frequently; and I met him four or five days after in Greenwich park. When he &s;aw me he appeared a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, and a&s;ked me how I came back? I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In a &s;hip.'</Q> To which he replied dryly, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I &s;uppo&s;e you did not walk back to London on the water.'</Q> As I &s;aw, by his manner, that he did not &s;eem to be &s;orry for his behaviour to me, and that I had not much rea&s;on to expect any favour from him, I told him that he
<PB N="86" REF="87">
had u&s;ed me very ill, after I had been &s;uch a faithful &s;ervant to him for &s;o many years; on which, without &s;aying any more, he turned about and went away. A few days after this I met Capt. Pa&s;cal at Mi&s;s Guerin's hou&s;e, and a&s;ked him for my prize-money. He &s;aid there was none due to me; for, if my prize-money had been 10,000l. he had a right to it all. I told him I was informed otherwi&s;e: on which he bade me defiance; and in a bantering tone, de&s;ired me to commence a law|&s;uit again&s;t him for it: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There are law|yers enough,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that will take the cau&s;e in hand, and you had better try it.'</Q> I told him then that I would try it, which enraged him very much; however, out of regard to the ladies, I remained &s;till, and never made any far|ther demand of my right. Some time afterwards the&s;e &s;riendly ladies a&s;ked
<PB N="87" REF="88">
me what I meant to do with my&s;elf, and now they could a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I thanked them, and &s;aid, if they plea&s;ed, I would be their &s;ervant; but if not, I had thirty-&s;even gnineas, which would &s;up|port me for &s;ome time, I would be much obliged to them to recommend me to &s;ome per&s;on who would teach me a bu&s;ine&s;s whereby I might earn my living. They an&s;wered me very po|litely, that they were &s;orry it did not &s;uit them to take me as their &s;ervant, and a&s;ked me what bu&s;ine&s;s I &s;hould like to learn? I &s;aid, hair-dre&s;&s;ing. They then promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this; and &s;oon after they recommended me to a gentleman whom I had known before, one Capt. O'Hara, who treated me with much kindne&s;s, and procured me a ma&s;ter, a hair-dre&s;&s;er, in Coventry-court, Haymarket, with whom he placed me. I was with this man from Septem|ber
<PB N="88" REF="89">
till the February following. In that time we had a neighbour in the &s;ame court who taught the French-horn. He u&s;ed to blow it &s;o well that I was charmed with it, and agreed with him to teach me to blow it. Accordingly he took me in hand, and began to in|&s;truct me, and I &s;oon learned all the three parts. I took great delight in blowing on this in&s;trument, the evenings being long; and be&s;ides that I was fond of it, I did not like to be idle, and it filled up my vacant hours innocently. At this time al&s;o I agreed with the Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the &s;ame court, where he kept an academy and an evening-&s;chool, to improve me in arithmetic. This he did as far as barter and alligation; &s;o that all the time I was there I was entirely em|ployed. In February 1768, I hired my&s;elf to Dr. Charles Irving, in Pall|mall,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
&s;o celebrated for his &s;ucce&s;sful experiments in making &s;ea water fre&s;h; and here I had plenty of hair dre&s;&s;ing to improve my hand. This gentleman was an excellent ma&s;ter; he was exceed|ingly kind and good tempered; and allowed me in the evenings to attend my &s;chools, which I e&s;teemed a great ble&s;&s;ing; therefore I thanked God and him for it, and u&s;ed all my diligence to improve the opportunity. This dili|gence and attention recommended me to the notice and care of my three pre|ceptors, who on their parts be&s;towed a great deal of pains in my in&s;truction, and be&s;ides were all very kind to me. My wages, however, which were by two thirds le&s;s than ever I had in my life (for I had only 12l. per annum) I &s;oon found would not be &s;ufficient to defray this extraordinary expence of ma&s;ters, and my own nece&s;&s;ary ex|pences;
<PB N="90" REF="91">
my old thirty-&s;even guineas had by this time worn all away to one. I thought it be&s;t, therefore, to try the &s;ea again in que&s;t of more money, as I had been bred to it, and had hitherto found the profe&s;&s;ion of it &s;ucce&s;sful. I had al&s;o a very great de&s;ire to &s;ee Turkey, and I now determined to gra|tify it. Accordingly, in the month of May, 1768, I told the doctor my wi&s;h to go to &s;ea again, to which he made no oppo&s;ition; and we parted on friendly terms. The &s;ame day I went into the city in que&s;t of a ma&s;ter. I was ex|tremely fortunate in my inquiry; for I &s;oon heard of a gentleman who had a &s;hip going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a man who could dre&s;s hair well. I was overjoyed at this, and went imme|diately on board of his &s;hip, as I had been directed, which I found to be fitted up with great ta&s;te, and I already
<PB N="91" REF="92">
foreboded no &s;mall plea&s;ure in &s;ailing in her. Not finding the gentleman on board, I was directed to his lodgings, where I met with him the next day, and gave him a &s;pecimen of my dre&s;&s;ing. He liked it &s;o well that he hired me immediately, &s;o that I was perfectly happy; for the &s;hip, ma&s;ter, and voyage, were intirely to my mind. The &s;hip was called the Delawar, and my ma&s;ter's name was John Jolly, a neat &s;mart good humoured man, ju&s;t &s;uch an one as I wi&s;hed to &s;erve. We &s;ailed from England in July following, and our voyage was extremely plea&s;ant. We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all the&s;e places I was charmed with the richne&s;s and beauty of the countries, and &s;truck with the elegant buildings with which they abound. We had always in them plenty of extraordinary good wines and
<PB N="92" REF="93">
rich fruits, which I was very fond of; and I had frequent occa&s;ions of gratify|ing both my ta&s;te and curio&s;ity; for my captain always lodged on &s;hore in tho&s;e places, which afforded me oppor|tunities to &s;ee the country around. I al&s;o learned navigation of the mate, which I was very &s;ond of. When we left Italy we had delightful &s;ailing among the Archipelago i&s;lands, and from thence to Smyrna in Turkey. This is a very ancient city; the hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, and mo&s;t of them have graves adjoining to them; &s;o that they &s;ometimes pre&s;ent the appearence of church-yards. Provi&s;ions are very plentiful in this city, and good wine le&s;s than a penny a pint. The grapes, pomegranates, and many other fruits, were al&s;o the riche&s;t and large&s;t I ever ta&s;ted. The natives are well looking and &s;trong made, and treated me al|ways
<PB N="93" REF="94">
with great civility. In general I believe they are fond of black peo|ple; and &s;everal of them gave me pre&s;&s;ing invitations to &s;tay among&s;t them, although they keep the franks, or Chri&s;tians, &s;eparate, and do not &s;uffer them to dwell immediately among&s;t them. I was a&s;toni&s;hed in not &s;eeing women in any of their &s;hops, and very rarely any in the &s;treets; and when|ever I did they were covered with a veil from head to foot, &s;o that I could not &s;ee their faces, except when any of them out of curio&s;ity uncovered them to look at me, which they &s;ometimes did. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee how the Greeks are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, kept un|der by the Turks, as the negroes are in the We&s;t Indies by the white people. The le&s;s refined Greeks, as I have al|ready hinted, dance here in the &s;ame manner as we do in our nation.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">
On the whole, during our &s;tay here, which was about five months, I liked the place and the Turks extremely well. I could not help ob&s;erving one very re|markable circum&s;tance there: the tails of the &s;heep are flat, and &s;o very large, that I have known the tail even of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds. The fat of them is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which it is much u&s;ed. Our &s;hip being at length richly loaded with &s;ilk, and other articles, we &s;ailed for England.</P>
<P>In May 1769, &s;oon after our return from Turkey, our &s;hip made a delight|ful voyage to Oporto in Portugal, where we arrived at the time of the carnival. On our arrival, there were &s;ent on board of us thirty-&s;ix articles to ob&s;erve with very heavy penalties if we &s;hould break any of them; and none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> us even dared to go on board any othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="95" REF="96">
ve&s;&s;el or on &s;hore, till the Inqui&s;ition had &s;ent on board and &s;earched for every thing illegal, e&s;pecially bibles. Such as were produced, and certain other things were &s;ent on &s;hore till the &s;hips were going away; and any per|&s;on in who&s;e cu&s;tody a bible was found concealed, was to be impri&s;oned and flogged, and &s;ent into &s;lavery for ten years. I &s;aw here many very magnifi|cent &s;ights, particularly the garden of Eden, where many of the clergy and laity went in proce&s;&s;ion in their &s;everal orders with the ho&s;t, and &s;ung Te De|um. I had a great curio&s;ity to go into &s;ome of their churches, but could not gain admittance without u&s;ing the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;prinkling of holy water at my entrance. From curio&s;ity, and a wi&s;h to be holy, I therefore complied with this ceremony, but its virtues were lo&s;t upon me, for I found my&s;elf nothing
<PB N="96" REF="97">
the better for it. This place abounds with plenty of all kinds of provi&s;ions. The town is well built and pretty, and commands a fine pro&s;pect. Our &s;hip having taken in a load of wine, and other commodities, we &s;ailed for Lon|don, and arrived in July following.</P>
<P>Our next voyage was to the Mediter|ranean. The &s;hip was again got ready, and we &s;ailed in September for Genoa. This is one of the fine&s;t cities I ever &s;aw; &s;ome of the edifices were of beau|tiful marble, and made a mo&s;t noble ap|pearance; and many had very curious fountains before them. The churches were rich and magnificent, and curi|ou&s;ly adorned both in the in&s;ide and out. But all this grandeur was in my eyes di&s;graced by the galley &s;laves, who&s;e condition both there and in other parts of Italy is truly piteous and wretch|ed. After we had &s;tayed there &s;ome
<PB N="97" REF="98">
weeks, during which we bought many different things we wanted, and got them very cheap, we &s;ailed to Naples, a charming city, and remarkably clean. The bay is the mo&s;t beautiful I ever &s;aw; the moles for &s;hipping are excel|lent. I thought it extraordinary to &s;ee grand operas acted here on Sunday nights, and even attended by their ma|je&s;ties. I too, like the&s;e great ones, went to tho&s;e &s;ights, and vainly &s;erv|ed God in the day while I thus &s;erved mammon effectually at night. While we remained here, there happened an eruption of mount Ve&s;uvius, of which I had a perfect view. It was extreme|ly awful; and we were &s;o near that the a&s;hes from it u&s;ed to be thick on our deck. After we had tran&s;acted our bu&s;ine&s;s at Naples, we &s;ailed with a fair wind once more for Smyrna, where we arrived in December. A &s;era&s;kier
<PB N="98" REF="99">
or officer, took a liking to me here, and wanted me to &s;tay, and offered me two wives; however I re&s;u&s;ed the temp|tation, thinking one was as much as &s;ome could manage, and more than others would venture on. The mer|chants here travel in caravans or large companies. I have &s;een many cara|vans from India, with &s;ome hundreds of camels, laden with different goods. The people of the&s;e caravans are quite brown. Among other articles, they brought with them a great quantity of locu&s;ts, which are a kind of pul&s;e, &s;weet and plea&s;ant to the palate, and in &s;hape re&s;embling French beans, but longer. Each kind of goods is &s;old in a &s;treet by it&s;elf, and I always found the Turks very hone&s;t in their dealings. They let no Chri&s;tians into their mo&s;ques or churches, for which I was very &s;orry; as I was always fond of going to &s;ee
<PB N="99" REF="100">
the different modes of wor&s;hip of the people wherever I went. The plague broke out while we were in Smyrna, and we &s;topped taking goods into the &s;hip till it was over. She was then richly laden, and we &s;ailed in about March 1770, for England. One day in our pa&s;&s;age we met with an accident which was near burning the &s;hip. A black cook, in melting &s;ome fat, over|&s;et the pan into the fire under the deck, which immediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the foretop. With the fright, the poor cook became almo&s;t white, and altoge|ther &s;peechle&s;s. Happily however we got the fire out without doing much mi&s;chief. After various delays in this pa&s;&s;age, which was tedious, we arrived in Standgate creek in July; and, at the latter end of the year, &s;ome new event
<PB N="100" REF="101">
occurred, &s;o that my noble captain, the &s;hip, and I all &s;eparated.</P>
<P>In April 1771, I &s;hipped my&s;elf as a &s;teward with Capt. Wm. Robert&s;on of the &s;hip Grenada Planter, once more to try my fortune in the We&s;t Indies; and we &s;ailed from London for Madeira, Barbadoes, and the Grenades. When we were at this la&s;t place, having &s;ome goods to &s;ell, I met once more with my former kind of We&s;t India cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>A white man, an i&s;lander, bought &s;ome goods of me to the amount of &s;ome pounds, and made me many fair promi&s;es as u&s;ual, but without any in|tention of paying me. He had like|wi&s;e bought goods from &s;ome more of our people, whom he intended to &s;erve in the &s;ame manner; but he &s;till amu&s;|ed us with promi&s;es. However, when our &s;hip was loaded, and near &s;ailing, this hone&s;t buyer di&s;covered no inten|tion
<PB N="101" REF="102">
or &s;ign of paying for any thing he had bought of us; but on the contrary, when I a&s;ked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of, &s;o that we found we were like to get more blows than payment. On this we went to complain to one Mr. M'Into&s;h, a ju&s;|tice of the peace; we told his wor&s;hip of the man's villainous tricks, and beg|ged that he would be kind enough to &s;ee us redre&s;&s;ed: but being negroes, although free, we could not get any remedy; and our &s;hip being then ju&s;t upon the point of &s;ailing, we knew not how to help our&s;elves, though we thought it hard to lo&s;e our property in this manner. Luckily for us however, this man was al&s;o indebted to three white &s;ailors, who could not get a far|thing from him; they therefore readily joined us, and we all went together in
<PB N="102" REF="103">
&s;earch of him. When we found where he was, I took him out of a hou&s;e and threatened him with vengeance; on which, finding he was likely to be handled roughly, the rogue offered each of us &s;ome &s;mall allowance, but nothing near our demands. This exa&s;perated us much more; and &s;ome were for cutting his ears off; but he begged hard for mercy, which was at la&s;t granted him, after we had entirely &s;tripped him. We then let him go, for which he thanked us, glad to get off &s;o ea&s;ily, and ran into the bu&s;hes, after having wi&s;hed us a good voyage. We then repaired on board, and &s;hortly after &s;et &s;ail for England. I cannot help remarking here a very narrow e&s;cape we had from being blown up, owing to a piece of negligence of mine. Ju&s;t as our &s;hip was under &s;ail, I went down under the cabin to do &s;ome bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
and had a lighted candle in my hand, which, in my hurry, without thinking, I held in a barrel of gun|powder. It remained in the powder until it was near catching &s;ire, when fortunately I ob&s;erved it and &s;natched it out in time, and providentially no harm happened; but I was &s;o over|come with terror that I immediately fainted at this deliverance.</P>
<P>In twenty-eight days time we arriv|ed in England, and I got clear of this &s;hip. But, being &s;till of a roving di&s;|po&s;ition, and de&s;irous of &s;eeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I &s;hipped my&s;elf &s;oon after, in the &s;ame year, as &s;teward on board of a fine large &s;hip, called the Jamaica, Captain David Watt; and we &s;ailed from England in December 1771, for Nevis and Jamaica. I found Jamaica to be a very fine large i&s;land, well peopled, and the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
<PB N="104" REF="105">
of the We&s;t India i&s;lands. There was a va&s;t number of negroes here, whom I found as u&s;ual exceed|ingly impo&s;ed upon by the white peo|ple, and the &s;laves puni&s;hed as in the other i&s;lands. There are negroes who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to flog &s;laves; they go about to different people for employ|ment, and the u&s;ual pay is from one to four bits. I &s;aw many cruel puni&s;h|ments inflicted on the &s;laves in the &s;hort time I &s;tayed here. In particular I was pre&s;ent when a poor fellow was tied up and kept hanging by the wri&s;ts at &s;ome di&s;tance from the ground, and then &s;ome half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles, in which po&s;ture he was flogged mo&s;t unmercifully. There were al&s;o, as I heard, two different ma&s;|ters noted for cruelty on the i&s;land, who had &s;taked up two negroes naked, and in two hours the vermin &s;tung them
<PB N="105" REF="106">
to death. I heard a gentleman, I well knew, tell my captain that he pa&s;&s;ed &s;en|tence on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poi&s;on an over&s;eer. I pa&s;s over numerous other in&s;tances, in order to relieve the reader by a milder &s;cene of roguery. Before I had been long on the i&s;land, one Mr. Smith at Port Morant, bought goods of me to the amount of twenty-five pounds &s;ter|ling; but when I demanded payment from him, he was going each time to beat me, and threatened that he would put me in goal. One time he would &s;ay I was going to &s;et his hou&s;e on fire; at another, he would &s;wear I was going to run away with his &s;laves. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at this u&s;age from a per|&s;on who was in the &s;ituation of a gen|tleman, but I had no alternative; and was therefore obliged to &s;ubmit. When I came to King&s;ton, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to
<PB N="106" REF="107">
&s;ee the number of Africans who were a&s;&s;embled together on Sundays; parti|cularly at a large commodious place, called Spring Path. Here each differ|ent nation of Africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country. They &s;till retain mo&s;t of their native cu&s;toms: they bury their dead, and put victuals, pipes and tobacco, and other things, in the grave with the corps, in the &s;ame manner as in Africa. Our &s;hip having got her loading we &s;ailed for London, where we arrived in the Augu&s;t following. On my re|turn to London, I waited on my old and good ma&s;ter, Dr. Irving, who made me an offer of his &s;ervice again. Being now tired of the &s;ea I gladly ac|cepted it. I was very happy in living with this gentleman once more; dur|ing which time we were daily employ|ed in reducing old Neptune's domi|nions
<PB N="107" REF="108">
by purifying the briny element and making it fre&s;h. Thus I went on till May 1773, when I was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of fame, to &s;eek new adven|tures, and find, towards the north pole, what our Creator never intended we &s;hould, a pa&s;&s;age to India. An expedition was now fitting out to ex|plore a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, conducted by the Honourable Con&s;tantine John Phipps, &s;ince Lord Mulgrave, in his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop of war the Race Hor&s;e. My ma&s;ter being anxious for the re|putation of this adventure, we therefore prepared every thing for our voyage, and I attended him on board the Race Hor&s;e, the 24th day of May, 1773. We proceeded to Sheerne&s;s, where we were joined by his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Carca&s;s, commanded by Captain Lutwidge. On the 4th of June, we &s;ailed towards our de&s;tined place, the
<PB N="108" REF="109">
pole; and on the 15th of the &s;ame month we were off Shetland. On this day I had a great and unexpected de|liverance from an accident which was near blowing up the &s;hip and de&s;troy|ing the crew, which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cautious. The &s;hip was &s;o filled that there was very little room on board for any one, which placed me in a very aukward &s;ituation. I had re&s;olved to keep a journal of this &s;ingular and in|tere&s;ting voyage; and I had no other place for this purpo&s;e but a little cabin, or the doctor's &s;tore-room, where I &s;lept. This little place was &s;tuffed with all manner of combu&s;tibles, particularly with tow and aquafortis, and many other dangerous things. Un|fortunately it happened in the evening as I was writing my journal, that I had occa&s;ion to take the candle out of the
<PB N="109" REF="110">
lanthorn, and a &s;park having touched a &s;ingle thread of the tow, all the re&s;t caught the flame, and immediately the whole was in a blaze. I &s;aw nothing but pre&s;ent death before me, and ex|pected to be the fir&s;t to peri&s;h in the flames. In a moment the alarm was &s;pread, and many people who were near, ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting out the fire. All this time I was in the very mid&s;t of the flames; my &s;hirt, and the handkerchief on my neck, were burnt, and I was almo&s;t &s;mothered with the &s;moke. However, through God's mercy, as I was nearly giving up all hopes, &s;ome people brought blankets and mattre&s;&s;es and threw them on the flames, by which means in a &s;hort time the fire was put out. I was &s;everely reprimanded and menaced by &s;uch of the officers who knew it, and &s;trictly charged never more to go there with a
<PB N="110" REF="111">
light: and, indeed, even my own fears made me give heed to this command for a little time&mdash;but at la&s;t, not being able to write my journal in any other part of the &s;hip, I was tempted again to venture by &s;tealth with a light in the &s;ame cabin, though not without con&s;iderable fear and dread on my mind. On the 20th of June, we began to u&s;e Dr. Irving's apparatus for mak|ing &s;alt water fre&s;h; I u&s;ed to attend the di&s;tillery: I frequently purified from twenty-&s;ix to forty gallons a day. The water thus di&s;tilled was perfectly pure, well ta&s;ted, and free from &s;alt; and was u&s;ed on various occa&s;ions on board the &s;hip. On the 28th of June, being in lat. 78, we made Greenland, where I was &s;urprized to &s;ee the &s;un did not &s;et. The weather now became extremely cold; and as we &s;ailed be|tween north and ea&s;t, which was our
<PB N="111" REF="112">
cour&s;e, we &s;aw many very high and curious mountains of ice; and al&s;o a great number of very large whales, which u&s;ed to come clo&s;e to our &s;hip, and blow the water up to a very great height in the air. One morning we had va&s;t quantities of &s;ea-hor&s;es about the &s;hip, which neighed exactly like any other hor&s;es. We fired &s;ome har|poon guns among&s;t them, in order to take &s;ome; but we could not get any. The 30th, the captain of a Greenland &s;hip came on board, and told us of three &s;hips that were lo&s;t in the ice; however we &s;till held on our cour&s;e till July the 11th, when we were &s;topt by one compact impenetrable body of ice. We ran along it from ea&s;t to we&s;t above ten degrees; and on the 27th we got as far north as 80, 37; and in 19 or 20 degrees; ea&s;t longitude from London. On the 29th and 30th of
<PB N="112" REF="113">
July, we &s;aw one continued plain of &s;mooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon; and we fa&s;tened to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick. We had generally &s;un|&s;hine, and con&s;tant daylight; which gave cheerfulne&s;s and novelty to the whole of this &s;triking, grand, and un|common &s;cene; and, to heighten it &s;till more, the reflection of the &s;un from the ice gave the clouds a mo&s;t beau|tiful appearance. We killed many dif|ferent animals at this time, and among the re&s;t nine bears. Though they had nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat. We u&s;ed to decoy them to the &s;hip &s;ometimes by burning feathers of &s;kins. I thought them cour&s;e eating, but &s;ome of the &s;hip's company reli&s;hed them very much. Some of our people once, in the boat, fired at and wounded a &s;ea|hor&s;e,
<PB N="113" REF="114">
which dived immediately; and in a little time after, brought up with it a number of others. They all joined in an attack upon the boat, and were with difficulty prevented from &s;taving or over&s;etting her; but a boat from the Carca&s;s having come to a&s;&s;i&s;t ours, and joined it, they di&s;per&s;ed, after having wre&s;ted an oar from one of the men. One of the &s;hip's boats had before been attacked in the &s;ame manner, but happily no harm was done. Though we wounded &s;everal of the&s;e animals we never got but one. We remained hereabouts until the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t; when the two &s;hips got completely fa&s;tened in the ice, occa&s;ioned by the loo&s;e ice that &s;et in from the &s;ea. This made our &s;ituation very dreadful and alarming; &s;o that on the 7th day, we were in very great apprehen&s;ion of having the &s;hips &s;queezed to pieces.
<PB N="114" REF="115">
The officers now held a council to know what was be&s;t for us to do in order to &s;ave our lives; and it was de|termined that we &s;hould endeavour to e&s;cape by dragging our boats along the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> towards the &s;ea; which, how|ever, was farther off than any of us thought. This determination filled us with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> dejection, and con|founded us with de&s;pair; for we had very little pro&s;pect of e&s;caping with life. However, we &s;awed &s;ome of the ice about the &s;hips, to keep it from hurting them; and thus kept them in a kind of pond. We then began to drag the boats as well as we could to|wards the &s;ea; but, after two or three days labour, we made very little pro|gre&s;s; &s;o that &s;ome of our hearts to|tally failed us, and I really began to give up my&s;elf for lo&s;t, when I &s;aw our &s;ur|rounding calamities. While we were
<PB N="115" REF="116">
at this hard labour, I once fell into a pond we had made among&s;t &s;ome loo&s;e ice, and was very near being drowned; but providentially &s;ome people were near who gave me immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and thereby I e&s;caped drowning. Our de|plorable condition, which kept up the con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of our peri&s;hing in the ice, brought me gradually to think of eternity in &s;uch a manner as I never had done before. I had the fears of death hourly upon me, and &s;huddered at the thoughts of meeting the grim king of terrors in the <HI>natu|ral</HI> &s;tate I then was in, and was ex|ceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if I &s;hould die in it. I had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time; for we &s;aw that our exi&s;tence could not be long on the ice after leav|ing the &s;hips, which were now out of &s;ight, and &s;ome miles from the boats.
<PB N="116" REF="117">
Our appearance now became truly la|mentable; pale dejection &s;eized every countenance; many, who had been before bla&s;phemers, in this our di&s;tre&s;s began to call on the good God of hea|ven for his help; and in the time of our utter need he heard us, and again&s;t hope or human probability, delivered us! It was the eleventh day of the &s;hips being thus fa&s;tened, and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner, that the wind changed to the E. N. E. The weather immediately became mild, and the ice broke to|wards the &s;ea, which was to the S. W. of us. Many of us on this got on board again, and with all our might we hove the &s;hips into every open water we could find, and made all the &s;ail on them in our power: and now, having a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, we made &s;ignals for the boats and the remainder
<PB N="117" REF="118">
of the people. This &s;eemed to us like a reprieve from death; and happy was the man who could fir&s;t get on board of any &s;hip, or the fir&s;t boat he could meet. We then proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again, which we accompli&s;hed in about thirty hours, to our infinite joy and gladne&s;s of heart. As &s;oon as we were out of danger, we came to anchor and refitted; and on the 19th of Augu&s;t, we &s;ailed from this uninhabited extre|mity of the world, where the inho&s;|pitable climate affords neither food nor &s;helter, and not a tree or &s;hrub of any kind grows among&s;t its barren rocks; but all is one de&s;olate and ex|panded wa&s;te of ice, which even the con&s;tant beams of the &s;un for &s;ix months in the year, cannot penetrate or di&s;&s;olve. The &s;un now being on the decline, the days &s;hortened as
<PB N="118" REF="119">
we &s;ailed to the &s;outhward; and, on the 28th, in latitude 73, it was dark by ten o'clock at night. September the 10th, in latitude 58-59, we met a very &s;evere gale of wind and high &s;eas, and &s;hipped a great deal of water in the &s;pace of ten hours. This made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole day; and one &s;ea, which &s;truck the &s;hip with more force than any thing I ever met with of the kind before, laid her under water for &s;ome time, &s;o that we thought &s;he would have gone down. Two boats were wa&s;hed &s;rom the booms, and the long-boat from the chucks: all other moveable things on the decks were al&s;o wa&s;hed away, among which were many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from Greenland; and we were obliged, in order to lighten the &s;hip, to to&s;s &s;ome of our guns over|board.
<PB N="119" REF="120">
We &s;aw a &s;hip at the &s;ame time, in very great di&s;tre&s;s, and her ma&s;ts were gone; but we were unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.

And thus ended our Arctic voyage, to the no &s;mall joy of all on board, after having been ab&s;ent four months; in which time, at the imminent hazard of our lives, we ex|plored nearly as far towards the Pole as 81 degrees north, and 20 degrees ea&s;t longitude; being much farther, by all accounts, than any navigator had ever ventured before; in which we fully proved the impracticability of finding a pa&s;&s;age that way to India.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR voyage to the North Pole be|ing ended, I returned to London with Doctor Irving, with whom I continued for &s;ome time, during which I began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the dangers I had e&s;caped, particularly tho&s;e of my la&s;t voyage, which made a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and, by the grace of God,
<PB N="121" REF="122">
proved afterwards a mercy to me; it cau&s;ed me to reflect deeply on my eternal &s;tate, and to &s;eek the Lord with full purpo&s;e of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was determined to work out my own &s;alvation, and in &s;o doing, procure a title to heaven; being the re&s;ult of a mind blended by igno|rance and &s;in.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time I left my ma&s;ter, Doctor Irving, the puri&s;ier of waters. I lodged in Coventry-court, Hay|market, where I was continually op|pre&s;&s;ed and much concerned about the &s;alvation of my &s;oul, and was deter|mined (in my own &s;trength) to be a fir&s;t-rate Chri&s;tian. I u&s;ed every means for this purpo&s;e; and, not being able to find any per&s;on among&s;t tho&s;e with
<PB N="122" REF="123">
whom I was then acquainted that ac|quie&s;ced with me in point of religion, or, in &s;cripture language, that would &s;hew me any good, I was much de|jected, and knew not where to &s;eek relief; however, I fir&s;t frequented the neighbouring churches, St. James's, and others, two or three times a day, for many weeks: &s;till I came away di&s;&s;atis|fied: &s;omething was wanting that I could not obtain, and I really found more heart-felt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church; and, being re&s;olved to be &s;aved, I pur&s;ued other methods. Fir&s;t I went among the quakers, where the word of God was neither read or preached, &s;o that I remained as much in the dark as ever. I then &s;earched into the Ro|man catholic principles, but was not in the lea&s;t edified. I at length had re|cour&s;e to the Jews, which availed me
<PB N="123" REF="124">
nothing, as the fear of eternity daily hara&s;&s;ed my mind, and I knew not where to &s;eek &s;helter from the wrath to come. However this was my con|clu&s;ion, at all events, to read the four evangeli&s;ts, and whatever &s;ect or party I found adhering thereto, &s;uch I would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leadeth to eternal life. I a&s;ked dif|ferent people que&s;tions about the man|ner of going to heaven, and was told different ways. Here I was much &s;tag|gered, and could not find any at that time more righteous than my&s;elf, or in|deed &s;o much inclined to devotion. I thought we &s;hould not all be &s;aved (this is agreeable to the holy &s;criptures) nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten command|ments. So righteous was I in my own
<PB N="124" REF="125">
eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in that point, by keeping eight out of ten; and finding tho&s;e who in general termed them&s;elves Chri&s;tians not &s;o hone&s;t or &s;o good in their morals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a &s;afer way of &s;alvation than my neighbours: &s;o that between hopes and fears I went on, and the chief com|forts I enjoyed were in the mu&s;ical French horn, which I then practi&s;ed, and al&s;o dre&s;&s;ing of hair. Such was my &s;ituation &s;ome months, experiencing the di&s;hone&s;ty of many people here. I determined at la&s;t to &s;et out for Turkey, and there to end my days. It was now early in the &s;pring 1774. I &s;ought for a ma&s;ter, and found a captain John Hughes, commander of a &s;hip called Anglicania, fitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Tur|key. I &s;hipped my&s;elf with him as a
<PB N="125" REF="126">
&s;teward; at the &s;ame time I recommend|ed to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on board the &s;hip near two months do|ing his duty: he had formerly lived many years with Mr. William Kirk|patrick, a gentleman of the i&s;land of St. Kitts, from whom he parted by con|&s;ent, though he afterwards tried many &s;chemes to inveigle the poor man. He had applied to many captains who traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and when all their attempts and &s;chemes of kidnapping proved abortive, Mr. Kirk|patrick came to our &s;hip at Union Stairs, on Ea&s;ter Monday, April the fourth, with two wherry boats and &s;ix men, having learned that the man was on board; and tied, and forcibly took him away from the &s;hip, in the pre&s;ence of the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him after he had information
<PB N="126" REF="127">
to come away. I believe this was a combined piece of bu&s;ine&s;s: but, be that as it may, it certainly reflected great di&s;grace on the mate and captain al&s;o, who, although they had de&s;ired the oppre&s;&s;ed man to &s;tay on board, yet this vile act on the man who had &s;erved him, he did not in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t to re|cover or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him his liberty if po&s;&s;ible, having known the want of li|berty my&s;elf. I &s;ent as &s;oon as I could to Grave&s;end, and got knowledge of the &s;hip in which he was; but unluckily &s;he had &s;ailed the fir&s;t tide after he was put on board. My intention was then immediately to apprehend Mr. Kirk|patrick, who was about &s;etting off for Scotland; and, having obtained a <HI>ha|bcas corpus</HI> for him, and got a tip&s;taff to
<PB N="127" REF="128">
go with me to St. Paul's church-yard, where he lived, he, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome|thing of this kind, &s;et a watch to look out. My being known to them, obliged me to u&s;e the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might not know me, and this had the de&s;ired effect. He did not go out of his hou&s;e that night, and next morning I contrived a well plotted &s;tratagem, notwith&s;tanding he had a gentleman in his hou&s;e to per&s;onate him. My direction to the tip|&s;taff, who got admittance into the hou&s;e, was to conduct him to a judge, accord|ing to the writ. When he came there, his plea was, that he had not the body in cu&s;tody, on which he was admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that well known philanthropi&s;t, Gran|ville Sharp, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who received me with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, and gave me every in&s;truction that was needful on
<PB N="128" REF="129">
the occa&s;ion. I le&s;t him in full hope that I &s;hould gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp, for his kindne&s;s; but alas! my attor|ney proved unfaithful; he took my money, lo&s;t me many months em|ploy, and did not do the lea&s;t good in the cau&s;e; and when the poor man ar|rived at St. Kitts, he was, according to cu&s;tom, &s;taked to the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wri&s;ts, and two on his ancles, was cut and flog|ged mo&s;t unmercifully, and afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very moving letters from him, while he was in this &s;ituation; and made attempts to go after him at a great hazard, but was &s;adly di&s;appointed: I al&s;o was told of it by &s;ome very re&s;pec|table families now in London, who &s;aw him in St. Kitts, in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which he remained till kind death re|lea&s;ed
<PB N="129" REF="130">
him out of the hands of his ty|rants. During this di&s;agreeable bu&s;i|ne&s;s I was under &s;trong convictions of &s;in, and thought that my &s;tate was wor&s;e than any man's; my mind was unac|countably di&s;turbed; I often wi&s;hed for death, though at the &s;ame time con|vinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful &s;ummons. Suffering much by villains in the late cau&s;e, and being much concerned about the &s;tate of my &s;oul, the&s;e things (but particularly the latter) brought me very low; &s;o that I became a burden to my&s;elf, and viewed all things around me as emptine&s;s and vanity, which could give no &s;atisfaction to a troubled con&s;cience. I was again determined to go to Turkey, and re|&s;olved, at that time, never more to return to England. I engaged as &s;teward on board a Turkeyman (the We&s;ter Hall, Capt. Lina) but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and others. All this appeared
<PB N="130" REF="131">
to be again&s;t me, and the only comfort I then experienced was, in reading the holy &s;criptures, where I &s;aw that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'there is no new thing under the &s;un,'</Q> Ec|cle&s;. i. 9; and what was appointed for me I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to. Thus I continued to travel in much heavine&s;s, and fre|quently murmured again&s;t the Al|mighty, particularly in his providential dealings; and, awful to think! I be|gan to bla&s;pheme, and wi&s;hed often to be any thing but a human being. In the&s;e &s;evere conflicts the Lord an&s;wered me by awful <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'vi&s;ions of the night, when deep &s;leep falleth upon men, in &s;lumberings upon the bed,'</Q> Job xxxiii. 15. He was plea&s;ed, in much mercy, to give me to &s;ee, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure under&s;tand, the great and awful &s;cene of the judgment-day, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'no unclean per&s;on, no unholy thing, can enter into the kingdom of God,</Q> Eph.
<PB N="131" REF="132">
v. 5. I would then, if it had been po&s;|&s;ible, have changed my nature with the meane&s;t worm on the earth; and was ready to &s;ay to the mountains and rocks <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'fall on me,'</Q> Rev. vi. 16; but all in vain. I then in the greate&s;t agony reque&s;ted the divine Creator, that he would grant me a &s;mall &s;pace of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities, which I felt were grievous. The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was plea&s;ed to grant my reque&s;t, and being yet in a &s;tate of time the &s;en&s;e of God's mercies were &s;o great on my mind when I awoke, that my &s;trength entirely fail|ed me for many minutes, and I was ex|ceedingly weak. This was the fir&s;t &s;piritual mercy I ever was &s;en&s;ible or, and being on praying ground, as &s;oon as I recovered a little &s;trength, and got out of bed and dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, I invoked Heaven from my inmo&s;t &s;oul, and &s;er|vently begged that God would never
<PB N="132" REF="133">
again permit me to bla&s;pheme his mo&s;t holy name. The Lord, who is long|&s;uffering, and full of compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch poor rebels as we are, conde&s;cended to hear and an&s;wer. I felt that I was al|together unholy, and &s;aw clearly what a bad u&s;e I had made of the faculties I was endowed with: they were given me to glorify God with; I thought, there|fore, I had better want them here, and enter into life eternal, than abu&s;e them and be ca&s;t into hell &s;ire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than tho&s;e with whom I was acquaint|ed, that the Lord would point them out to me. I appealed to the Searcher of hearts, whether I did not wi&s;h to love him more, and &s;erve him better. Not|with&s;tanding all this, the reader may ea|&s;ily di&s;cern, if a believer, that I was &s;till in nature's darkne&s;s. At length I hated
<PB N="133" REF="134">
the hou&s;e in which I lodged, becau&s;e God's mo&s;t holy name was bla&s;phemed in it; then I &s;aw the word of God ve|rified, viz. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Before they call, I will an&s;wer; and while they are yet &s;peak|ing, I will hear.'</Q></P>
<P>I had a great de&s;ire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the hou&s;e in the day, rather than &s;tay among&s;t the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it plea&s;ed God to direct me to a hou&s;e where there was an old &s;ea-faring man, who experienced much of the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart. He began to di&s;cour&s;e with me; and, as I de&s;ired to love the Lord, his conver&s;ation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never heard before the love of Chri&s;t to believers &s;et forth in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;o clear a point of view. Here I had more que&s;tions to
<PB N="134" REF="135">
put to the man than his time would per|mit him to an&s;wer: and in that memor|able hour there came in a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter; he joined our di&s;cour&s;e, and a&s;ked me &s;ome few que&s;tions; among others, where I heard the go&s;pel preached? I knew not what he meant by hearing the go&s;pel; I told him I had read the go&s;pel: and he a&s;ked where I went to church, or whether I went at all or not? To which I replied <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I attended St. James's, St. Martin's, and St. Ann's Soho;'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'So,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you are a churchman?'</Q>I an&s;wered, I was. He then invited me to a love|fea&s;t at his chapel that evening. I ac|cepted the offer, and thanked him; and &s;oon after he went away, I had &s;ome further di&s;cour&s;e with the old Chri&s;|tian, added to &s;ome profitable read|ing, which made me exceedingly hap|py. When I left him he reminded me
<PB N="135" REF="136">
of coming to the fea&s;t; I a&s;&s;ured him I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed over the heavenly conver|&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two men, which cheered my then heavy and drooping &s;pirit more than any thing I had met with for many months. How|ever, I thought the time long in going to my &s;uppo&s;ed banquet. I al&s;o wi&s;hed much for the company of the&s;e friendly men; their company plea&s;ed me much; and I thought the gentleman very kind in a&s;king me, a &s;tranger, to a fea&s;t; but how &s;ingular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the wi&s;h|ed for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly &s;eated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the place filled with people, and no &s;igns of eating and drinking. There were many mini&s;ters in the company. At la&s;t they began
<PB N="136" REF="137">
by giving out hymns, and between the &s;inging, the mini&s;ters engaged in prayer: in &s;hort, I knew not what to make of this &s;ight, having never &s;een any thing of the kind in my life before now. Some of the gue&s;ts began to &s;peak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the Scriptures: much was &s;aid by every &s;peaker of the providence of God, and his un&s;peakable mercies, to each of them. This I knew in a great mea&s;ure, and could mo&s;t heartily join them. But when they &s;poke of a future &s;tate, they &s;eemed to be altogether cer|tain of their calling and election of God; and that no one could ever &s;eperate them from the love of Chri&s;t, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with utter con&s;ternation, intermingled with admiration. I was &s;o amazed as not to know what to think of the com|pany; my heart was attracted, and my
<PB N="137" REF="138">
affections were enlarged. I wi&s;hed to be as happy as them, and was per&s;uaded in my mind that they were different from the world <Q REND="inline">'that lieth in wickedne&s;s,'</Q> 1 John v. 19. Their language and &s;inging, &amp;c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wi&s;hed to live and die thus. La&s;tly, &s;ome per&s;ons in the place produced &s;ome neat ba&s;kets full of buns, which they di&s;tributed about; and each per&s;on communicated with his neighbour, and &s;ipped water out of different mugs, which they handed about to all who were pre&s;ent. This kind of Chri&s;tian fellow|&s;hip I had never &s;een, nor ever thought of &s;eeing on earth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy &s;crip|tures, of the primitive Chri&s;tians, who loved each other and broke bread; in partaking of it, even from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. This entertainment (which la&s;ted about four hours) ended in &s;ing|ing
<PB N="138" REF="139">
and prayer. It was the fir&s;t &s;oul fea&s;t I ever was pre&s;ent at. This la&s;t twenty-four hours produced me things, &s;piritual and temporal, &s;leeping and waking, judgment and mercy, that I could not but admire the goodne&s;s of God, in directing the blind, bla&s;phem|ous &s;inner in the path that he knew not of, even among the ju&s;t; and in&s;tead of judgment he has &s;hewed mercy, and will hear and an&s;wer the prayers and &s;up|plications of every returning prodigal:
<Q><L>O! to grace how great a debtor</L>
<L>Daily I'm con&s;train'd to be!</L></Q></P>
<P>After this I was re&s;olved to win Hea|ven if po&s;&s;ible; and if I peri&s;hed I thought it &s;hould be at the feet of Je&s;us, in praying to him for &s;alvation. After having been an eye-witne&s;s to &s;ome of the happine&s;s which attended tho&s;e who feared God, I knew not how, with any
<PB N="139" REF="140">
propriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was continually profaned, at which I felt the greate&s;t horror; I pau&s;ed in my mind for &s;ome time, not knowing what to do; whe|ther to hire a bed el&s;ewhere, or go home again. At la&s;t fearing an evil report might ari&s;e, I went home, with a farewel to card-playing and vain je&s;t|ing, &amp;c. I &s;aw that time was very &s;hort, eternity long, and very near; and I viewed tho&s;e per&s;ons alone ble&s;&s;ed who were found ready at midnight call, or when the judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.</P>
<P>The next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to &s;ee my new and worthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C&mdash;; he, with his wife, a gra|cious woman, were at work at &s;ilk weaving; they &s;eemed mutually happy, and both quite glad to &s;ee me, and I
<PB N="140" REF="141">
more &s;o to &s;ee them. I &s;at down and we conver&s;ed much about &s;oul matters, &amp;c. Their di&s;cour&s;e was amazingly de|lightful, edifying, and plea&s;ant. I knew not at la&s;t how to leave this agreeable pair, till time &s;ummoned me away. As I was going they lent me a little book, entitled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The conver&s;ion of an In|dian."</Q> It was in que&s;tions and an&s;wers. The poor man came over the &s;ea to London, to inquire after the Chri&s;tian's God, who, (through rich mercy) he found, and had not his jour|ney in vain. The above book was of great u&s;e to me, and at that time was a means of &s;trengthening my faith; how|ever, in parting, they both invited me to call on them when I plea&s;ed. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the improvement from it I could; and &s;o far I thanked God for &s;uch com|pany and de&s;ires. I prayed that the
<PB N="141" REF="142">
many evils I felt within might be done away, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances. This was quickly heard and an&s;wered, and I was &s;oon connected with tho&s;e whom the &s;cripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the go&s;pel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers, and the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t alone was evi|dently &s;et forth. Thus I went on hap|pily for near two months; and I once heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman Mr. G. &s;peak of a man who had departed this life in full a&s;&s;urance of his going to glory I was much a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the a&s;&s;ertion; and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was an&s;wered fully, agreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told al&s;o, that if I did not experience the new birth,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
and the pardon of my &s;ins, through the blood of Chri&s;t, before I died, I could not enter the kingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I thought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy interpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that no man ever did or could keep the commandments, with|out offending in one point. I thought this &s;ounded very &s;trange, and puzzled me much for many weeks; for I thought it a hard &s;aying. I then a&s;ked my friend Mr. L&mdash;d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments of God were given, if we could not be &s;aved by them? To which he replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The law is a &s;choolma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t,'</Q> who alone could and did keep the commandments, and fulfilled all their requirements for his elect people, even tho&s;e to whom he had given
<PB N="143" REF="144">
a living faith, and the &s;ins of tho&s;e cho&s;en ve&s;&s;els <HI>were already</HI> atoned for and forgiven them whil&s;t living; and if I did not experience the &s;ame before my exit, the Lord would &s;ay at that great day to me, <Q REND="inline">'Go, ye cur&s;ed,'</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. for God would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in &s;hewing mercy to tho&s;e were ordained to it before the world was; therefore Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;eem|ed to be all in all to that man's &s;oul. I was much wounded at this di&s;cour&s;e, and brought into &s;uch a dilemma as I never expected. I a&s;ked him, if <HI>he</HI> was to die that moment, whether he was &s;ure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, <Q REND="inline">'Do you <HI>know</HI> that your &s;ins are forgiven you?'</Q> He an&s;wered in the affirmative. Then confu&s;ion, anger, and di&s;content &s;eized me, and I &s;tag|gered much at this &s;ort of doctrine; it
<PB N="144" REF="145">
brought me to a &s;tand, not knowing which to believe, whether &s;alvation by works, or by faith only in Chri&s;t. I reque&s;ted him to tell me how I might know when my &s;ins were forgiven me. He a&s;&s;ured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do this. I told him it was very my&s;terious; but he &s;aid it was really matter of fact, and quoted many portions of &s;cripture immediately to the point, to which I could make no reply. He then de&s;ired me to pray to God to &s;hew me the&s;e things. I an&s;wered, that I prayed to God every day? He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I perceive you are a churchman.</Q> I an&s;wered, I was. He then entreated me to beg of God to &s;hew me what I was, and the true &s;tate of my &s;oul. I thought the prayer very &s;hort and odd; &s;o we parted for that time. I weighed all the&s;e things well over, and could not help thinking how it was po&s;&s;ible for a man to know
<PB N="145" REF="146">
that his &s;ins were forgiven him in this life. I wi&s;hed that God would reveal this &s;elf &s;ame thing unto me. In a &s;hort time after this I went to We&s;tmin&s;ter chapel; the Rev. Mr. P&mdash; preached from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful &s;ermon; he clearly &s;hewed that a living man had no cau&s;e to complain for the puni&s;hments of his &s;ins; he evidently ju&s;tified the Lord in all his dealings with the &s;ons of men; he al&s;o &s;hewed the ju&s;tice of God in the eternal puni&s;h|ment of the wicked and impenitent. The di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed to me like a two-edged &s;word cutting all ways; it afforded me much joy, intermingled with many fears about my &s;oul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intended, the en&s;uing week, to examine all tho&s;e who meant to attend the Lord's table. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the &s;ame time was doubt|ful
<PB N="146" REF="147">
of my being a proper object to re|ceive the &s;acrament; I was full of me|ditation till the day of examining. However, I went to the chapel, and, though much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I addre&s;&s;ed the reverend gentleman, thinking if I was not right, he would endeavour to con|vince me of it. When I conver&s;ed with him, the fir&s;t thing he a&s;ked me, was, what I knew of Chri&s;t? I told him I believed in him, and had been baptized in his name. <Q REND="inline">'Then,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'when were you brought to the knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of &s;in?'</Q> I knew not what he meant by the&s;e que&s;tions; I told him I kept eight commandments out of ten; but that I &s;ometimes &s;wore on board &s;hip, and &s;ometimes when on &s;hore, and broke the &s;abbath. He then a&s;ked me if I could read? I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'Yes.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Then,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'do you not read in the bible

Here I was &s;truck with awe; for the mini&s;ter exhorted me much, and reminded me of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, and the length of eternity, and that no unregenerate &s;oul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>He did not admit me as a commu|nicant; but recommended me to read the &s;criptures, and hear the word preach|ed, not to neglect fervent prayer to God, who has promi&s;ed to hear the &s;uppli|cations of tho&s;e who &s;eek him in godly &s;incerity; &s;o I took my leave of him, with many thanks, and re&s;olved to fol|low his advice, &s;o far as the Lord would conde&s;cend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ, nor was I
<PB N="148" REF="149">
likely to get a &s;ituation &s;uitable for me, which obliged me to go once more to &s;ea. I engaged as &s;teward of a &s;hip called the Hope, Capt. Richard Strange, bound from London to Cadiz in Spain. In a &s;hort time after I was on board I heard the name of God much bla&s;|phemed, and I feared greatly, le&s;t I &s;hould catch the horrible infection. I thought if I &s;inned again, after having life and death &s;et evidently before me, I &s;hould certainly go to hell. My mind was uncommonly chagrined, and I mur|mured much at God's providential deal|ings with me, and was di&s;contented with the commandments, that I could not be &s;aved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wi&s;hed I had never been born; confu&s;ion &s;eized me, and I wi&s;hed to be annihilated. One day I was &s;tanding on the very edge of the &s;tern of the &s;hip, thinking to drown
<PB N="149" REF="150">
my&s;elf; but this &s;cripture was in&s;tantly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That no mur|derer hath eternal life abiding in him,'</Q> 1 John iii. 15. Then I pau&s;ed, and thought my&s;elf the unhappie&s;t man liv|ing. Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than I de&s;erved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I began to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a burden to others, but more &s;o to my&s;elf. At length I concluded to beg my bread on &s;hore rather than go again to &s;ea among&s;t a people who feared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to di&s;|charge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater encou|ragement to continue with him, and all on board &s;hewed me very great civility: notwith&s;tanding all this I was unwilling to embark again. At la&s;t &s;ome of my
<PB N="150" REF="151">
religious friends advi&s;ed me, by &s;aying it was my lawful calling, con&s;equently it was my duty to obey, and that God was not con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ined to place, &amp;c. &amp;c. par|ticularly Mr. G. S. the governor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my ca&s;e, and read the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed for me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my bur|den was then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt re&s;ignation to the will of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted. We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We &s;ailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain. It was the fourth of the month of September when we &s;ailed from Lon|don; we had a delightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty-third of the &s;ame month. The place
<PB N="151" REF="152">
is &s;trong, commands a fine pro&s;pect, and is very rich. The Spani&s;h galloons frequent that port, and &s;ome arrived whil&s;t we were there. I had many op|portunities of reading the &s;criptures. I wre&s;tled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep &s;ighs of the poor in &s;pirit. I found this verified to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment and comfort in the following manner:</P>
<P>On the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) all that day, I thought that I &s;hould either &s;ee or hear &s;omething &s;upernatural. I had a &s;ecret impul&s;e on my mind of &s;omething that was to take place, which drove me conti|nually for that time to a throne of grace. It plea&s;ed God to enable me to wre&s;tle with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that if &s;udden death were to happen, and I peri&s;hed, it might be at Chri&s;t's feet.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
In the evening of the &s;ame day, as I was reading and meditating on the fourth chapter of the Acts, twelfth ver&s;e, under the &s;olemn apprehen&s;ions of eternity, and reflecting on my pa&s;t actions, I be|gan to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to be|lieve I had an intere&s;t in the divine fa|vour; but &s;till meditating on the &s;ubject, not knowing whether &s;alvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds, or &s;olely as the &s;overeign gift of God;&mdash;in this deep con&s;ternation the Lord was plea&s;ed to break in upon my &s;oul with his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an in&s;tant as it were, removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I &s;aw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cro&s;s on mount Calvary: the &s;criptures be|came an un&s;ealed book, I &s;aw my&s;elf a condemned criminal under the law,

I was then con|vinced that by the fir&s;t Adam &s;in came, and by the &s;econd Adam (the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) all that are &s;aved mu&s;t be made alive. It was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again, John iii. 5. I &s;aw the eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God's decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal, everla&s;ting, and unchangeable purpo&s;es. The word of God was &s;weet to my ta&s;te, yea &s;weeter than honey and the honeycomb. Chri&s;t was revealed to my &s;oul as the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and. The&s;e heavenly moments

were really as life to the dead, and what John calls an earne&s;t of the Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 13, 14. &amp;c.</NOTE>. This was indeed un&s;peakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many. Now every leading providential cir|cum&s;tance that happened to me, from the day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view, as if it had but ju&s;t then occurred. I was &s;en&s;ible of the invi&s;ible hand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it not: &s;till the Lord pur&s;ued me although I &s;lighted and di&s;regarded it; this mercy melted me down. When I con&s;idered my poor wretched &s;tate I wept, &s;eeing what a great debtor I was to &s;overeign free grace. Now the Ethiopian was willing to be &s;aved by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;inner's only &s;urety, and al&s;o to rely on none other per&s;on or thing for &s;alvation.

Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do. Oh! the amazing things of that hour can never be told&mdash;it was joy in the Holy Gho&s;t!

Such were my grief and joy as I believe are &s;eldom experienced. I was bathed in tears, and &s;aid, What am I that God &s;hould thus look on me the vile&s;t of &s;inners? I felt a deep concern for my mother and friends, which occa&s;ioned me to pray with fre&s;h ardour; and in the aby&s;s of thought, I viewed the un|converted people of the world in a very awful &s;tate, being without God and without hope.</P>

It plea&s;ed God to pour out on me the &s;pirit of prayer and the grace of &s;up|plication, &s;o that in loud acclamations I was enabled to prai&s;e and glorify his mo&s;t holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told &s;ome of the people what the Lord had done for me, alas, who could under&s;tand me or believe my report!&mdash;None but to whom the arm of the Lord was revealed.

I thought my ca&s;e &s;ingular, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much longed to be with &s;ome to whom I could tell of the won|ders of God's love towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my &s;oul loved and thir&s;ted after.

Whenever I looked in the bible I &s;aw things new, and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort, for I knew that to me was the word of &s;alvation &s;ent. Sure I was that the Spirit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in Je&s;us&mdash;that the &s;ame Spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promi&s;es that were precious to me, and enabled me to believe to the &s;alvation of my &s;oul.

endeavoured to buffet me with, viz. Rom. xi. 6. and, as I had heard of the Reverend Mr. Romaine, and his great knowledge in the &s;criptures, I wi&s;hed much to hear him preach. One day I went to Blackfriars church, and, to my great &s;atisfaction and &s;urpri&s;e, he preached from that very text. He very clearly &s;hewed the difference be|tween human works and free election, which is according to God's &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN our &s;hip was got ready for &s;ea again, I was intreated by the cap|tain to go in her once more; but, as I felt my&s;elf now as happy as I could with to be in this life, I for &s;ome time refu&s;ed; however, the advice of my friends at la&s;t prevailed; and, in full re&s;ignation to the will of God, I again
<PB N="169" REF="170">
embarked for Cadiz in March 1775. We had a very good pa&s;&s;age, without any material accident, until we arrived off the Bay of Cadiz; when one Sun|day, ju&s;t as we were going into the har|bour, the &s;hip &s;truck again&s;t a rock and knocked off a garboard plank, which is the next to the keel. In an in&s;tant all hands were in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and began with loud cries to call on God to have mercy on them. Although I could not &s;wim, and &s;aw no way of e&s;caping death, I felt no dread in my then &s;ituation, having no de&s;ire to live. I even rejoiced in &s;pirit, thinking this death would be &s;udden glory. But the fulne&s;s of time was not yet come. The people near to me were much a&s;toni&s;hed in &s;eeing me thus calm and re&s;igned; but I told them of the peace of God, which through &s;overeign grace I enjoyed, and
<PB N="170" REF="171">
the&s;e words were that in&s;tant in my mind:
<Q><L>" Chri&s;t is my pilot wi&s;e, my compa&s;s is his word;</L>
<L>" My &s;oul each &s;torm de&s;ies, while I have &s;uch a Lord.</L>
<L>" I tru&s;t his faithfulne&s;s and power,</L>
<L>" To &s;ave me in the trying hour.</L>
<L>" Though rocks and quick&s;ands deep through all my pa&s;&s;age lie,</L>
<L>" Yet Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;afely keep and guide me with his eye,</L>
<L>" How can I &s;ink with &s;uch a prop,</L>
<L>" That bears the world and all things up?"</L></Q></P>
<P>At this time there were many large Spani&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ukers or pa&s;&s;age-ve&s;&s;els full of people cro&s;&s;ing the channel; who &s;eeing our condition, a number of them came along&s;ide of us. As many hands as could be employed began to work; &s;ome at our three pumps, and the re&s;t unloading the &s;hip as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. There being only a &s;ingle rock called the Porpus on which we &s;truck, we &s;oon got off it, and providentially it was then high water, we therefore run the &s;hip
<PB N="171" REF="172">
a&s;hore at the neare&s;t place to keep her from &s;inking. After many tides, with a great deal of care and indu&s;try, we got her repaired again. When we had di&s;patched our bu&s;ine&s;s at Cadiz, we went to Gibraltar, and from thence to Malaga, a very plea&s;ant and rich city, where there is one of the fine&s;t cathe|drals I had ever &s;een. It had been above fifty years in building, as I heard, though it was not then quite fini&s;hed; great parts of the in&s;ide, however, was completed and highly decorated with the riche&s;t marble columns and many &s;uperb paintings; it was lighted occa|&s;ionally by an amazing number of wax tapers of different &s;izes, &s;ome of which were as thick as a man's thigh; the&s;e, however, were only u&s;ed on &s;ome of their grand fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;hocked at the cu&s;tom of bull-baiting, and other di|ver&s;ions
<PB N="172" REF="173">
which prevailed here on Sun|day evenings, to the great &s;candal of Chri&s;tianity and morals. I u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s my abhorrence of it to a prie&s;t whom I met with. I had frequent conte&s;ts about religion with the reve|rend father, in which he took great pains to make a pro&s;elyte of me to his church; and I no le&s;s to convert him to mine. On the&s;e occa&s;ions I u&s;ed to produce my Bible, and &s;hew him in what points his church erred. He then &s;aid he had been in England, and that every per&s;on there read the Bible, which was very wrong; but I an&s;wer|ed him that Chri&s;t de&s;ired us to &s;earch the Scriptures. In his zeal for my con|ver&s;ion, he &s;olicited me to go to one of the univer&s;ities in Spain, and de|clared that I &s;hould have my educa|tion free; and told me, if I got my|&s;elf made a prie&s;t, I might in time
<PB N="173" REF="174">
become even pope; and that Pope Benedict was a black man. As I was ever de&s;irous of learning, I pau&s;ed for &s;ome time upon this temptation; and thought by being crafty I might catch &s;ome with guile; but I began to think that it would be only hypocri&s;y in me to embrace his offer, as I could not in con&s;cience conform to the opinions of his church. I was therefore enabled to regard the word of God, which &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'Come out from among&s;t them,'</Q> and refu&s;ed Father Vincent's offer. So we parted without conviction on ei|ther &s;ide.</P>
<P>Having taken at this place &s;ome fine wines, fruits, and money, we pro|ceeded to Cadiz, where we took about two tons more of money, &amp;c. and then &s;ailed for England in the month of June. When we were about the north latitude 42, we had contrary wind for
<PB N="174" REF="175">
&s;everal days, and the &s;hip did not make in that time above &s;ix or &s;even miles &s;trait cour&s;e. This made the cap|tain exceeding fretful and peevi&s;h: and I was very &s;orry to hear God's mo&s;t holy name often bla&s;phemed by him. One day, as he was in that im|pious mood, a young gentleman on board, who was a pa&s;&s;enger, reproached him, and &s;aid he acted wrong; for we ought to be thankful to God for all things, as we were not in want of any thing on board; and though the wind was contrary for us, yet it was fair for &s;ome others, who, perhaps, &s;tood in more need of it than we. I imme|diately &s;econded this young gentleman with &s;ome boldne&s;s, and &s;aid we had not the lea&s;t cau&s;e to murmur, for that the Lord was better to us than we de&s;erved, and that he had done all things well. I expected that the cap|tain
<PB N="175" REF="176">
would be veay angry with me for &s;peaking, but he replied not a word. However, before that time on the fol|lowing day, being the 21&s;t of June, much to our great joy and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, we &s;aw the providential hand of our benign Creator, who&s;e ways with his blind creatures are pa&s;t finding out. The preceding night I dreamed that I &s;aw a boat immediately off the &s;tarboard main &s;hrouds; and exactly at half pa&s;t one o'clock, the following day at noon, while I was below, ju&s;t as we had dined in the cabin, the man at the helm cried out, A boat! which brought my dream that in&s;tant into my mind. I was the fir&s;t man that jumped on the deck; and looking from the &s;hrouds onward, according to my dream, I de&s;cried a little boat at &s;ome di&s;tance; but, as the waves were high, it was as much as we could do &s;ometimes to di&s;|cern
<PB N="176" REF="177">
her; we however &s;topped the &s;hip's way, and the boat, which was extreme|ly &s;mall, came along&s;ide with eleven mi|&s;erable men, whom we took on board immediately. To all human appear|ance, the&s;e people mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the cour&s;e of one hour or le&s;s, the boat being &s;mall, it barely con|tained them. When we took them up they were half drowned, and had no victuals, compa&s;s, water, or any other nece&s;&s;ary what&s;oever, and had only one bit of an oar to &s;teer with, and that right before the wind; &s;o that they were obliged to tru&s;t entirely to the mercy of the waves. As &s;oon as we got them all on board, they bowed them&s;elves on their knees, and, with hands and voices lifted up to heaven, thanked God for their deliverance; and I tru&s;t that my prayers were not wanting among&s;t them at the &s;ame
<PB N="177" REF="178">
time. This mercy of the Lord quite melted me, and I recollected his words, which I faw thus verified in the 107th P&s;alm, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Hungry and thir&s;ty, their &s;ouls fainted in them. They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their di&s;tre&s;&s;e&s;s. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s and for his wonderful works to the chil|dren of men! For he &s;atisfieth the longing &s;oul, and &s;illeth the hungry &s;oul with goodne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Such as &s;it in dardne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death:</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he &s;aved them out of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. They that go down

<P>The poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed captain &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the Lord is good; for, &s;eeing that I am not fit to die, he there|fore gave me a &s;pace of time to repent.'</Q> I was very glad to hear this expre&s;&s;ion, and took an opportunity when convenient of talking to him on the providence of God. They told us they were Portugue&s;e, and were in a brig loaded with corn, which &s;hifted that morning at five o'clock, owing to which the ve&s;&s;el &s;unk that in&s;tant with two of the crew; and how the&s;e eleven got into the boat (which was la&s;hed to the deck) not one of them could tell.
<PB N="179" REF="180">
We provided them with every nece&s;|&s;ary, and brought them all &s;afe to Lon|don: and I hope the Lord gave them repentance unto life eternal.</P>
<P>I was happy once more among&s;t my friends and brethren, till November, when my old friend, the celebrated Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable &s;ine &s;loop, about 150 tons. He had a mind for a new adventure in cultivat|ing a plantation at Jamaica, and the Mu&s;quito Shore; a&s;ked me to go with him, and &s;aid that he would tru&s;t me with his e&s;tate in preference to any one. By the advice, therefore, of my friends, I accepted of the offer, know|ing that the harve&s;t was fully ripe in tho&s;e parts, and hoped to be an in|&s;trument under God, of bringing &s;ome poor &s;inner to my well beloved ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Before I embarked, I found with the Doctor four Ma&s;quito
<PB N="180" REF="181">
Indians, who were chiefs in their own country, and were brought here by &s;ome Engli&s;h traders for &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h ends. One of them was the Mu&s;quito king's &s;on; a youth of about eighteen years of age; and whil&s;t he was here he was baptized by the name of George. They were going back at the government's expen&s;e, after having been in England about twelve months, during which they learned to &s;peak pretty good Engli&s;h. When I came to talk to them about eight days before we &s;ailed, I was very much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches &s;ince they were here, to be baptized, nor was any attention paid to their morals. I was very &s;orry for this mock Chri&s;tianity, and had ju&s;t an opportunity to take &s;ome of them once to church before we &s;ailed. We embarked in the month of Novem|ber
<PB N="181" REF="182">
1776, on board of the &s;loop Morn|ing Star, Captain David Miller, and &s;ailed for Jamaica. In our pa&s;&s;age, I took all the pains that I could to in&s;truct the Indian prince in the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, of which he was entirely ignorant; and, to my great joy, he was quite attentive, and received with glad|ne&s;s the truths that the Lord enabled me to &s;et forth to him. I taught him in the compa&s;s of eleven days all the let|ters, and he could put even two or three of them together and &s;pell them. I had Fox's Martyrology with cuts, and he u&s;ed to be very fond of looking into it, and would a&s;k many que&s;tions about the papal cruelties he &s;aw de|picted there, which I explained to him. I made &s;uch progre&s;s with this youth, e&s;pecially in religion, that when I u&s;ed to go to bed at different hours of the night, if he was in his bed, he would
<PB N="182" REF="183">
get up on purpo&s;e to go to prayer with me, without any other clothes than his &s;hirt; and before he would eat any of his meals among&s;t the gentlemen in the cabin, he would &s;ir&s;t come to me to pray as he called it. I was well plea&s;ed at this, and took great delight in him, and u&s;ed much &s;upplication to God for his conver&s;ion. I was in full hope of &s;eeing daily every appearance of that change which I could wi&s;h; not knowing the devices of &s;atan, who had many of his emi&s;&s;aries to &s;ow his tares as fa&s;t as I &s;owed the good &s;eed, and pull down as fa&s;t as I built up. Thus we went on nearly four fifths of our pa&s;&s;age, when &s;atan at la&s;t got the up|per hand. Some of his me&s;&s;engers, &s;eeing this poor heathen much ad|vanced in piety, began to a&s;k him whether I had converted him to Chri&s;tianity, laughed and made their
<PB N="183" REF="184">
je&s;t at him, for which I rebuked them as much as I could; but this treatment cau&s;ed the prince to halt between two opinions. Some of the true &s;ons of Belial, who did not believe that there was any hereafter, told him never to fear the devil, for there was none exi&s;ting; and if ever he came to the prince, they de&s;ired he might be &s;ent to them. Thus they teazed the poor innocent youth, &s;o that he would not learn his book any more! He would not drink nor carou&s;e with the&s;e un|godly actors, nor would he be with me, even at prayers. This grieved me very much. I endeavoured to per&s;uade him as well as I could, but he would not come; and entreated him very much to tell me his rea&s;ons for acting thus. At la&s;t he a&s;ked me, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write, and ob&s;erve the &s;un,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
and know all things, yet &s;wear, lie, and get drunk, only excepting your|&s;elf?'</Q> I an&s;wered him, the rea&s;on was, that they did not fear God; and that if any one of them died &s;o they could not go to, or be happy with God. He replied, that if the&s;e per&s;ons went to hell he would go to hell too. I was &s;orry to hear this; and, as he &s;ome|times had the tooth-ach, and al&s;o &s;ome other per&s;ons in the &s;hip at the &s;ame time, I a&s;ked him if their tooth-ach made his ea&s;y: he &s;aid, No. Then I told him if he and the&s;e people went to hell together, their pains would not make his any lighter. This an&s;wer had great weight with him: it depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits much; and he became ever after, during the pa&s;&s;age, fond of being alone. When we were in the latitude of Martinico, and near making the land, one morning we had a bri&s;k gale
<PB N="185" REF="186">
of wind, and, carrying too much &s;ail, the main-ma&s;t went over the &s;ide. Many people were then all about the deck, and the yards, ma&s;ts, and rig|ging, came tumbling all about us, yet there was not one of us in the lea&s;t hurt, although &s;ome were within a hair's breadth of being killed: and, particu|larly, I &s;aw two men who, by the provi|dential hand of God, were mo&s;t miracu|lou&s;ly pre&s;erved from being &s;ma&s;hed to pieces. On the fifth of January we made Antigua and Mont&s;errat, and ran along the re&s;t of the i&s;lands: and on the fourteenth we arrived at Jamaica. One Sunday while we were there I took the Mu&s;quito Prince George to church, where he &s;aw the &s;acrament admini&s;|tered. When we came out we &s;aw all kinds of people, almo&s;t from the church door for the &s;pace of half a mile down to the water&s;ide, buying and &s;elling all
<PB N="186" REF="187">
kinds of commodities: and the&s;e acts afforded me great matter of exhortation to this youth, who was much a&s;toni&s;hed. Our ve&s;&s;el being ready to &s;ail for the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, I went with the Doctor on board a Guinea-man, to purcha&s;e &s;ome &s;laves to carry with us, and cul|tivate a plantation; and I cho&s;e them all my own countrymen. On the twelfth of February we &s;ailed from Jamaica, and on the eighteenth arrived at the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, at a place called Du|peupy. All our Indian gue&s;ts now, after I had admoni&s;hed them and a few ca&s;es of liquor given them by the Doc|tor, took an affectionate leave of us, and went a&s;hore, where they were met by the Mu&s;quito king, and we never &s;aw one of them afterwards. We then &s;ailed to the &s;outhward of the &s;hore, to a place called Cape Gracias a Dios, where there was a large lagoon or
<PB N="187" REF="188">
lake, which received the emptying of two or three very fine large rivers, and abounded much in fi&s;h and land tor|toi&s;e. Some of the native Indians came on board of us here; and we u&s;ed them well, and told them we were come to dwell among&s;t them, which they &s;eemed plea&s;ed at. So the Doctor and I, with &s;ome others, went with them a&s;hore; and they took us to different places to view the land, in order to choo&s;e a place to make a plantation of. We fixed on a &s;pot near a river's bank, in a rich &s;oil; and, having got our nece&s;&s;aries out of the &s;loop, we began to clear away the woods, and plant different kinds of vegetables, which had a quick growth. While we were employed in this man|ner, our ve&s;&s;el went northward to Black River to trade. While &s;he was there, a Spani&s;h guarda co&s;ta met with and took her. This proved very hurtful,
<PB N="188" REF="189">
and a great embarra&s;&s;ment to us. How|ever, we went on with the culture of the land. We u&s;ed to make fires every night all around us, to keep off wild bea&s;ts, which, as &s;oon as it was dark, &s;et up a mo&s;t hideous roaring. Our habitation being far up in the woods, we frequently &s;aw different kinds of animals; but none of them ever hurt us, except poi&s;onous &s;nakes, the bite of which the Doctor u&s;ed to cure by giving to the patient as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, about half a tumbler of &s;trong rum, with a good deal of Cayenne pepper in it. In this manner he cured two natives and one of his own &s;laves. The Indians were exceedingly fond of the Doctor, and they had good rea&s;on for it; for I believe they never had &s;uch an u&s;eful man among&s;t them. They came from all quar|ters to our dwelling; and &s;ome <HI>woolwow</HI> or flat-headed Indians, who lived fifty or
<PB N="189" REF="190">
&s;ixty miles above our river, and this &s;ide of the South Sea, brought us a good deal of &s;ilver in exchange for our goods. The principal articles we could get from our neighbouring Indians, were turtle oil, and &s;hells, little &s;ilk gra&s;s, and &s;ome provi&s;ions; but they would not work at any thing for us, except fi&s;hing; and a few times they a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to cut &s;ome trees down, in order to build us hou&s;es; which they did exactly like the Africans, by the joint labour of men, women, and children. I do not recollect any of them to have had more than two wives. The&s;e always accompanied their hu&s;bands when they came to our dwelling, and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us, and always &s;quatted down behind their hu&s;bands. Whenever we gave them any thing to eat, the men and their wives eat &s;eperate. I never &s;aw the
<PB N="190" REF="191">
lea&s;t &s;ign of incontinence among&s;t them. The women are ornamented with beads, and fond of painting them&s;elves; the men al&s;o paint, even to exce&s;s, both their faces and &s;hirts: their favourite colour is red. The women generally cultivate the ground, and the men are all fi&s;hermen and canoe makers. Upon the whole, I never met any nation that were &s;o &s;imple in their manners as the&s;e people, or had &s;o little ornament in their hou&s;es. Neither had they, as I ever could learn, one word expre&s;&s;ive of an oath. The wor&s;t word I ever heard among&s;t them when they were quarrel|ling, was one that they had got from the Engli&s;h, which was <Q REND="inline">'you ra&s;cal.'</Q> I never &s;aw any mode of wor&s;hip among them; but in this they were not wor&s;e than their European brethren or neighbours, for I am &s;orry to &s;ay that there was not one white per&s;on in our dwelling, nor
<PB N="191" REF="192">
any where el&s;e, that I &s;aw, in different places I was at on the &s;hore, that was better or more pious than tho&s;e unen|lightened indians; but they either worked or &s;lept on Sundays: and, to my &s;orrow, working was too much Sun|day's employment with our&s;elves; &s;o much &s;o, that in &s;ome length of time we really did not know one day from another. This mode of living laid the foundation of my decamping at la&s;t. The natives are well made and warlike; and they particularly boa&s;t of having never been conquered by the Spaniards. They are great drinkers of &s;trong liquors when they can get them. We u&s;ed to di&s;til rum from pine apples, which were very plentiful here; and then we could not get them away from our place. Yet they &s;eemed to be &s;in|gular, in point of hone&s;ty, above any other nation I was ever among&s;t. The
<PB N="192" REF="193">
country being hot, we lived under an open &s;hed, where we had all kinds of goods, without a door or a lock to any one article; yet we &s;lept in &s;afety, and never lo&s;t any thing, or were di&s;turbed. This &s;urpri&s;ed us a good deal; and the Doctor, my&s;elf, and others, u&s;ed to &s;ay if we were to lie in that manner in Europe we &s;hould have our throats cut the fir&s;t night. The Indian governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or di&s;trict, and has a number of men with him as attendants and a&s;&s;i&s;tants. He &s;ettles all the differences among the people, like the judge here, and is treated with very great re&s;pect. He took care to give us timely notice before he came to our habitation, by &s;ending his &s;tick as a token, for rum, &s;ugar, and gunpowder, which we did not re|fu&s;e &s;ending; and at the &s;ame time we made the utmo&s;t preparation to receive
<PB N="193" REF="194">
his honour and his train. When he came with his tribe, and all our neigh|bouring chieftians, we expected to &s;ind him a grave reverend judge, &s;olid and &s;agacious; but in&s;tead of that, before he and his gang came in &s;ight, we heard them very clamorous; and they even had plundered &s;ome of our good neighbouring Indians, having intoxi|cated them&s;elves with our liquor. When they arrived we did not know what to make of our new gue&s;ts, and would gladly have di&s;pen&s;ed with the honour of their company. However, having no alternative, we fea&s;ted them plen|tifully all the day till the evening; when the governor, getting quite drunk, grew very unruly, and &s;truck one of our mo&s;t friendly chiefs, who was our neare&s;t neighbour, and al&s;o took his gold-laced hat from him. At this a great commotion taken place; and the
<PB N="194" REF="195">
Doctor interfered to make peace, as we could all under&s;tand one another, but to no purpo&s;e; and at la&s;t they became &s;o outrageous that the Doctor, fearing he might get into trouble, left the hou&s;e, and made the be&s;t of his way to the neare&s;t wood, leaving me to do as well as I could among them. I was &s;o enraged with the Governor, that I could have wi&s;hed to have &s;een him tied fa&s;t to a tree and flogged for his behaviour; but I had not people enough to cope with his party. I therefore thought of a &s;tratagem to appea&s;e the riot. Recollecting a pa&s;&s;age I had read in the life of Columbus, when he was among&s;t the Indians in Mexico or Peru, where on &s;ome occa&s;ion, he frightened them, by telling them of certain events in the heavens, I had recour&s;e to the &s;ame expedient; and it &s;ucceeded be|yond my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.
<PB N="195" REF="196">
When I had formed my determination. I went in the mid&s;t of them; and, tak|ing hold of the Governor, I pointed up to the heavens. I menaced him and the re&s;t: I told them God lived there, and that he was angry with them, and they mu&s;t not quarrel &s;o; that they were all brothers, and if they did not leave off, and go away quietly, I would take the book (point|ing to the Bible) read, and <HI>tell</HI> God to make them dead. This operated on them like magic.&mdash;The clamour im|mediately cea&s;ed, and I gave them &s;ome rum and a few other things; after which they went away peaceably; and the Governor afterwards gave our neighbour, who was called Captain Pla&s;myah, his hat again. When the Doctor returned, he was exceedingly glad at my &s;ucce&s;s in thus getting rid of our trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts. The Mu&s;|quito
<PB N="196" REF="197">
people within our vicinity, out of re&s;pect to the Doctor, my&s;elf, and his people, made entertainments of the grand kind, called in their tongue <HI>tourri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>dryckbot.</HI> The Engli&s;h of this expre&s;&s;ion is, a fea&s;t of drinking about, of which it &s;eems a corruption of lan|guage. The drink con&s;i&s;ted of pine apples roa&s;ted, and ca&s;ades chewed or beaten in mortars; which, after lying &s;ome time, ferments, and becomes &s;o &s;trong as to intoxicate, when drank in any quantity. We had timely notice given to us of the entertainment. A white family, whithin five miles of us, told us how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time to the village, where the mirth was ap|pointed to be held, and there we &s;aw the whole art of making the drink, and al&s;o the kind of animals that were to be eaten there. I cannot &s;ay the &s;ight
<PB N="197" REF="198">
of either the drink or the meat were enticing to me. They had &s;ome thou|&s;ands of pine apples roa&s;ting, which they &s;queezed dirt and all, into a canoe they had there for the purpo&s;e. The ca&s;ade drink was in beef barrels, and other ve&s;&s;els, and looked exactly like hog-wa&s;h. Men, women, and children, were thus employed in roa&s;ting the pine apples, and &s;queezing them with their hands. For &s;ood they had many land torpins or tortoi&s;es, &s;ome dried turtle, and three large alligators alive, and tied fa&s;t to the trees. I a&s;ked the people what they were going to do with the&s;e alligators; and I was told they were to be eaten. I was much &s;urpri&s;|ed at this, and went home, not a little di&s;gu&s;ted at the preparations. When the day of the fea&s;t was come, we took &s;ome rum with us, and went to the ap|pointed place, where we found a great
<PB N="198" REF="199">
a&s;&s;emblage of the&s;e people, who re|ceived us very kindly. The mirth had begun before we came; and they were dancing with mu&s;ic: and the mu&s;ical in&s;truments were nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of any other &s;able people; but, as I thought much le&s;s melodious than any other nation I ever knew. They had many curious ge&s;tures in dancing, and a variety of motions and po&s;tures of their bodies, which to me were in no wi&s;e attracting. The males danced by them&s;elves, and the females al&s;o by them&s;elves, as with us. The Doctor &s;hewed his people the example, by im|mediately joining the women's party, though not by their choice. On per|ceiving the women di&s;gu&s;ted, he joined the males. At night there were great illuminations, by &s;etting fire to many pine trees, while the dryckbot went round merrily by calaba&s;hes or gourds: but the liquor might more ju&s;tly be
<PB N="199" REF="200">
called eating than drinking. One Ow|den, the olde&s;t father in the vicinity, was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;trange and terrifying form. Around his body were &s;kins adorned with different kinds of feathers, and he had on his head a very large and high head-piece, in the form of a gre|nadier's cap, with prickles like a por|cupine: and he made a certain noi&s;e which re&s;embled the cry of an alligator. Our people &s;kipped among&s;t them out of complai&s;ance, though &s;ome could not drink of their tourrie; but our rum met with cu&s;tomers enough, and was &s;oon gone. The alligators were killed and &s;ome of them roa&s;ted. Their manner of roa&s;ting is by digging a hole in the earth, and filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay &s;ticks acro&s;s, on which they &s;et the meat. I had a raw piece of the alligator in my hand: it was very rich: I thought it looked like fre&s;h &s;almon, and it had a
<PB N="200" REF="201">
mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell, but I could not eat any of it. This merry-making at la&s;t ended without the lea&s;t di&s;cord in any per&s;on in the company, although it was made up of different nations and complexions.</P>
<P>The rainy &s;ea&s;on came on here about the latter end of May, which continued till Augu&s;t very heavily; &s;o that the rivers were overflow|ed, and our provi&s;ions then in the ground were wa&s;hed away. I thought this was in &s;ome mea&s;ure a judgment upon us for working on Sundays, and it hurt my mind very much. I often wi&s;hed to leave this place and &s;ail for Europe; for our mode of procedure and living in this heatheni&s;h form was very irk&s;ome to me. The word of God &s;aith, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What does it avail a man if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul?'</Q> This was much and hea|vily impre&s;&s;ed on my mind; and though

I did not know how to &s;peak to the Doctor for my di&s;charge, it was di&s;|agreeable for me to &s;tay any longer. But about the middle of June I took courage enough to a&s;k him for it.

Though I was much attached to the Doctor, I was happy when he con&s;ented. I got every thing ready for my depart|ure, and hired &s;ome Indians, with a large canoe, to carry me off. All my poor countrymen, the &s;laves, when they heard of my leaving them, were very &s;orry, as I had always treated them with care and affection, and did every thing I could to comfort the poor creatures, and render their condition ea&s;y. Hav|ing taken leave of my old friends and companions, on the 18th of June, ac|companied by the Doctor, I left that &s;pot of the world, and went &s;outhward above twenty miles along the river. There I found a &s;loop, the captain of which told me he was going to Jamaica. Having agreed for my pa&s;&s;age with him and one of the owners, who was al&s;o on board, named Hughes, the Doctor and I parted, not without &s;hed|ding
<PB N="203" REF="204">
tears on both &s;ides. The ve&s;&s;el then &s;ailed along the river till night, when &s;he &s;topped in a lagoon within the &s;ame river. During the night a &s;chooner belonging to the &s;ame owners came in, and, as &s;he was in want of hands, Hughes, the owner of the &s;loop a&s;ked me to go in the &s;chooner as a &s;ailor, and &s;aid he would give me wages. I thanked him; but I &s;aid I wanted to go to Jamaica. He then immediately changed his tone, and &s;wore, and abu&s;ed me very much, and a&s;ked how I came to be freed. I told him, and &s;aid that I came into that vicinity with Dr. Irving; whom he had &s;een that day. This account was of no u&s;e; he &s;till &s;wore exceedingly at me, and cur&s;ed the ma&s;|ter for a fool that &s;old me my freedom, and the doctor for another in letting me go from him. Then he de&s;ired me to go in the &s;chooner, or el&s;e I &s;hould
<PB N="204" REF="205">
not go out of the &s;loop as a free-man. I &s;aid this was very hard, and begged to be put on &s;hore again; but he &s;wore that I &s;hould not. I &s;aid I had been twice among&s;t the Turks, yet had never &s;een any &s;uch u&s;age with them, and much le&s;s could I have expected any thing of this kind among the Chri&s;|tians. This incen&s;ed him exceedingly; and, with a volley of oaths and impre|cations, he replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Chri&s;tians! damn you, you are one of St. Paul's men; but by G&mdash;, except you have St. Paul's or St. Peter's faith, and walk upon the water to the &s;hore, you &s;hall not go out of the ve&s;&s;el;'</Q> which I now learnt was going among&s;t the Spaniards towards Carthagena, where he &s;wore he would &s;ell me. I &s;imply a&s;ked him what right he had to &s;ell me? but, without another word, he made &s;ome of his people tie ropes round each of
<PB N="205" REF="206">
my ancles, and al&s;o to each wri&s;t, and another rope round my body, and hoi&s;ted me up without letting my feet touch or re&s;t upon any thing. Thus I hung, without any crime committed, and without judge or jury; merely be|cau&s;e I was a free man, and could not by the law get any redre&s;s from a white per&s;on in tho&s;e parts of the world. I was in great pain from my &s;ituation, and cried and begged very hard for &s;ome mercy; but all in vain. My tyrant, in a great rage brought a mu&s;|quet out of the cabin and loaded it before me and the crew, and &s;wore that he would &s;hoot me if I cried any more. I had now no alternative; I therefore remained &s;ilent, &s;eeing not one white man on board who &s;aid a word on my behalf. I hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o'clock at night till about one in the morning;
<PB N="206" REF="207">
when, finding my cruel abu&s;er fa&s;t a&s;leep, I begged &s;ome of his &s;laves to &s;lack the rope that was round my body, that my feet might re&s;t on &s;omething. This they did at the ri&s;k of being cruelly u&s;ed by their ma&s;ter, who beat &s;ome of them &s;everely at fir&s;t for not tying me when he commanded them. Whil&s;t I remained in this condition, till between five and &s;ix o'clock next morning, I tru&s;t I prayed to God to forgive this bla&s;phemer, who cared not what he did, but when he got up out of his &s;leep in the morning was of the very fame temper and di&s;po&s;ition as when he left me at night. When they got up the anchor, and the ve&s;&s;el was getting under way, I once more cried and begged to be relea&s;ed; and now, being fortunately in the way of their hoi&s;ting the &s;ails, they relea&s;ed me. When I was let down, I &s;poke to one Mr. Cox,
<PB N="207" REF="208">
a carpenter, whom I knew on board, on the impropriety of this conduct. He al&s;o knew the doctor, and the good opinion he ever had of me. This man then went to the captain, and told him not to carry me away in that manner? that I was the doctor's &s;teward, who regarded me very highly, and would re&s;ent this u&s;age when he &s;hould come to know it. On which he de&s;ired a young man to put me a&s;hore in a &s;mall canoe I brought with me. This &s;ound gladdened my heart, and I got ha&s;tily into the canoe and &s;et off, whil&s;t my tyrant was down in the cabin; but he &s;oon &s;pied me out, when I was not above thirty or forty yards from the ve&s;&s;el, and running upon the deck with a loaded mu&s;ket in his hand, he pre|&s;ented it at me, and &s;wore heavily and dreadfully, that he would &s;hoot me that in&s;tant, if I did not come back on
<PB N="208" REF="209">
board. As I knew the wretch would have done as he &s;aid, without he&s;itation, I put back to the ve&s;&s;el again; but, as the good Lord would have it, ju&s;t as I was along&s;ide he was abu&s;ing the captain for letting me go from the ve&s;|&s;el; which the captain returned, and both of them &s;oon got into a very great heat. The young man that was with me now got out of the canoe; the ve&s;|&s;el was &s;ailing on fa&s;t with a &s;mooth &s;ea: and I then thought it was neck or no|thing, &s;o at that in&s;tant I &s;et off again, for my life, in the canoe, towards the &s;hore; and fortunately the confu&s;ion was &s;o great among&s;t them on board, that I got out of the reach of the mu&s;|ket &s;hot unnoticed, while the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed on with a fair wind a different way; &s;o that they could not overtake me without tacking: but even before that could be done I &s;hould have been
<PB N="209" REF="210">
on &s;hore, which I &s;oon reached, with many thanks to God for this unex|pected deliverance. I then went and told the other owner, who lived near that &s;hore (with whom I had agreed for my pa&s;&s;age) of the u&s;age I had met with. He was very much a&s;toni&s;hed and appeared very &s;orry for it. After treating me with kindne&s;s, he gave me &s;ome refre&s;hment, and three heads of roa&s;ted Indian corn, for a voyage of about eighteen miles &s;outh, to look for another ve&s;&s;el. He then directed me to an Indian chief of a di&s;trict, who was al&s;o the Mu&s;quito admiral, and had once been at our dwelling; after which I &s;et off with the canoe acro&s;s a large lagoon alone (for I could not get any one to a&s;&s;i&s;t me), though I was much jaded, and had pains in my bowels, by means of the rope I had hung by the night before. I was therefore at differ|ent
<PB N="210" REF="211">
times unable to manage the canoe, for the paddling was very laborious. However, a little before dark I got to my de&s;tined place, where &s;ome of the Indians knew me, and received me kindly. I a&s;ked for the admiral; and they conducted me to his dwelling. He was glad to &s;ee me, and refre&s;hed me with &s;uch things as the place afforded; and I had a hammock to fleep in. They acted towards me more like Chri&s;tians than tho&s;e whites I was among&s;t the la&s;t night, though they had been bapti&s;ed. I told the admiral I wanted to go to the next port to get a ve&s;&s;el to carry me to Jamaica; and reque&s;ted him to &s;end the canoe back which I then had, for which I was to pay him. He agreed with me, and &s;ent five able Indians with a large canoe to carry my things to my intended place, about fifty miles; and we &s;et off
<PB N="211" REF="212">
the next morning. When we got out of the lagoon and went along &s;hore, the &s;ea was &s;o high that the canoe was oftentimes very near being filled with water. We were obliged to go a&s;hore and drag acro&s;s different necks of land; we were al&s;o two nights in the &s;wamps, which &s;warmed with mu&s;quito flies, and they proved trouble&s;ome to us. This tire&s;ome journey of land and wa|ter ended, however, on the third day, to my great joy; and I got on board of a &s;loop commanded by one Captain Jenning. She was then partly loaded, and he told me he was expecting daily to &s;ail for Jamaica; and having agreed with me to work my pa&s;&s;age, I went to work accordingly. I was not many days on board before we &s;ailed; but to my &s;orrow and di&s;appointment, though u&s;ed to &s;uch tricks, we went to the &s;outhward along the Mu&s;quito &s;hore,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
in&s;tead of &s;teering for Jamaica. I was compelled to a&s;&s;i&s;t in cutting a great deal of mahogany wood on the &s;hore as we coa&s;ted along it, and load the ve&s;&s;el with it, before &s;he &s;ailed. This fretted me much; but, as I did not know how to help my&s;elf among the&s;e deceivers, I thought patience was the only remedy I had left, and even that was forced. There was much hard work and little victuals on board, except by good luck we happened to catch turtles. On this coa&s;t there was al&s;o a particular kind of fi&s;h called manatee, which is mo&s;t ex|cellent eating, and the fle&s;h is more like beef than fi&s;h; the &s;cales are as large as a &s;hilling, and the &s;kin thicker than I ever &s;aw that of any other fi&s;h. Within the bracki&s;h waters along &s;hore there were likewi&s;e va&s;t numbers of alli|gators, which made the fi&s;h &s;carce. I was on board this &s;loop &s;ixteen days,
<PB N="213" REF="214">
during which, in our coa&s;ting, we came to another place, where there was a &s;maller &s;loop called the Indian Queen, commanded by one John Baker. He al&s;o was an Engli&s;hman, and had been a long time along the &s;hore trading for turtle &s;hells and &s;ilver, and had got a good quantity of each on board. He wanted &s;ome hands very much; and, un|der&s;tanding I was a freeman, and wanted to go to Jamaica, he told me if he could get one or two, that he would &s;ail im|mediately for that I&s;land: he al&s;o pre|tended to &s;hew me &s;ome marks of at|tention and re&s;pect, and promi&s;ed to give me forty-five &s;hillings &s;terling a a month if I would go with him. I thought this much better than cutting wood for nothing. I therefore told the other captain that I wanted to go to Ja|maica in the other ve&s;&s;el; but he would not li&s;ten to me; and, &s;eeing me re&s;olved
<PB N="214" REF="215">
to go in a day or two, he got the ve&s;&s;el to &s;ail, intending to carry me away again&s;t my will. This treatment mortified me~ extremely. I immediately, according to an agreement I had made with the captain of the Indian Queen, called for her boat, which was lying near us, and it came along&s;ide; and, by the means of a north-pole &s;hipmate which I met with in the &s;loop I was in, I got my things into the boat, and went on board of the Indian Queen, July the 10th. A few days after I was there, we got all things ready and &s;ailed: but again, to my great mortification, this ve&s;&s;el &s;till went to the &s;outh, nearly as far as Carthagena, trading along the coa&s;t, in&s;tead of going to Jamaica, as the captain had promi&s;ed me: and, what was wor&s;t of all, he was a very cruel and bloody-minded man, and was a horrid bla&s;phemer. Among others,
<PB N="215" REF="216">
he had a white pilot, one Stoker, whom he beat often as &s;everely as he did &s;ome negroes he had on board. One night in particular, after he had beaten this man mo&s;t cruelly, he put him into the boat, and made two negroes row him to a de&s;olate key, or &s;mall i&s;land; and he loaded two pi&s;tols, and &s;wore bitterly that he would &s;hoot the negroes if they brought Stoker on board again. There was not the lea&s;t doubt but that he would do as he &s;aid, and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate; but, when the captain was a&s;leep, the two negroes took a blanket and carried it to the unfortu|nate Stoker, which I believe was the means of &s;aving his life from the an|noyance of in&s;ects. A great deal of entreaty was u&s;ed with the captain the next day, before he would con&s;ent to let Stoker come on board; and when
<PB N="216" REF="217">
the poor man was brought on board he was very ill, from his &s;ituation during the night, and he remained &s;o till he was drowned a little time after. As we &s;ailed &s;outhward we came to many uninhabited i&s;lands, which were over|grown with fine large cocoa nuts. As I was very much in want of provi&s;ions, I brought a boat load of them on board, which la&s;ted me and others for &s;everal weeks, and afforded us many a delicious repa&s;t in our &s;carcity. One day, before this, I could not help ob|&s;erving the providential hand of God, that ever &s;upplied all our wants, though in the ways and manner we know not. I had been a whole day without food, and made &s;ignals for boats to come off, but in vain. I therefore earne&s;tly prayed to God for relief in my need; and at the clo&s;e of the evening I went off the deck. Ju&s;t as I laid down I heard a
<PB N="217" REF="218">
noi&s;e on the deck; and, not knowing what it meant, I went directly on the deck again, when what &s;hould I &s;ee but a fine large fi&s;h about &s;even or eight pounds, which had jumped aboard! I took it, and admired, with thanks, the good hand of God; and, what I con|&s;idered as not le&s;s extraordinary, the captain, who was very avaricious, did not attempt to take it from me, there being only him and I on board; for the re&s;t were all gone a&s;hore trading. Sometimes the people did not come off for &s;ome days: this u&s;ed to fret the captain, and then he would vent his fury on me by beating me, or making me feel in other cruel ways. One day e&s;pecially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after &s;triking me &s;everal times with different things, and once acro&s;s my mouth, even with a red burning &s;tick out of the fire, he got a barrel of
<PB N="218" REF="219">
gunpowder on the deck, and &s;wore that he would blow up the ve&s;&s;el. I was then at my wit's end, and earne&s;tly prayed to God to direct me. The head was out of the barrel; and the captain took a lighted &s;tick out of the fire to blow him&s;elf and me up, be|cau&s;e there was a ve&s;&s;el then in &s;ight coming in, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was a Spaniard, and he was afraid of falling into their hands. Seeing this I got an axe, unnoticed by him, and placed my&s;elf between him and the powder, having re&s;olved in my&s;elf as &s;oon as he attempted to put the fire in the barrel to chop him down that in&s;tant. I was more than an hour in this &s;ituation; during which he &s;truck me often, &s;till keeping the fire in his hand for this wicked purpo&s;e. I really &s;hould have thought my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in any other part of the world if I had killed him,
<PB N="219" REF="220">
and prayed to God, who gave me a mind which re&s;ted &s;olely on him&s;elf. I prayed for re&s;ignation, that his will might be done: and the following two portions of his holy word, which oc|cured to my mind, buoyed up my hope, and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He hath deter|mined the times before appointed, and &s;et bounds to our habitations,'</Q> Acts xvii. 26. And, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his &s;ervant, that walketh in darkne&s;s and hath no light? let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God,'</Q> I&s;aiah l. 20. And thus by the grace of God I was enabled to do. I found him a pre&s;ent help in the time of need, and the captain's fury began to &s;ub|&s;ide as the night approached: but I found,<Q><PB N="220" REF="221">
<L>" That he who cannot &s;tem his anger's tide</L>
<L>" Doth a wild hor&s;e without a bridle ride."</L></Q></P>
<P>The next morning we di&s;covered that the ve&s;&s;el which had cau&s;ed &s;uch a fury in the captain was an Engli&s;h &s;loop. They &s;oon came to an anchor where we were, and, to my no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, learned that Doctor Irving was on board of her on his way from the Mu&s;quito &s;hore to Jamaica. I was for going immediately to &s;ee this old ma&s;ter and friend, but the captain would not &s;uffe me to leave the ve&s;&s;el. I then informe the Doctor, by letter, how I was treated and begged that he would take me out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;loop: but he informed me that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was not in his power, as he was a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+&s;enger him&s;elf; but he &s;ent me &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> rum and &s;ugar for my own u&s;e.

on the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, during which the &s;laves were well fed and comfort|able, a white over&s;eer had &s;upplied my place: this man through inhumanity and ill-judged avarice, beat and cut the poor &s;laves mo&s;t unmercifully; and the con&s;equence was, that every one got into a large Puriogua canoe, and endeavoured to e&s;cape; but not know|ing where to go, or how to manage the canoe, they were all drowned; in con&s;equence of which the Doctor's plan|tation was left uncultivated, and he was now returning to Jamaica to purcha&s;e more &s;laves, and &s;tock it again.</P>
<P>On the 14th of October, the Indian Queen arrived at King&s;ton in Jamaica. When we were unloaded I demanded my wages, which amounted to eight pounds five &s;hillings &s;terling; but Captain Baker refu&s;ed to give me one farthing, although it was the harde&s;t|earned
<PB N="222" REF="223">
money I ever worked for in my life. I found out Doctor Irving upon this, and acquainted him of the cap|tain's knavery. He did all he could to help me to get my money; and we went to every magi&s;trate in King&s;ton (and there were nine) but they all re|fu&s;ed to do any thing for me, and &s;aid my oath could not be admitted again&s;t a white man. Nor was this all; for Baker threatened that he would beat me &s;everely if he could catch me for attempting to demand my money; and this he would have done, but that I got, by means of Doctor Irving, under the protection of Captain Douglas, of the Squirrel man of war. I thought this exceeding hard u&s;age; though indeed I found it to be too much the practice there to pay free negro men for their labour in this manner.</P>
<P>One day I went with a free negroe taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one
<PB N="223" REF="224">
Mr. Cochran, who was indebted to him &s;ome trifling &s;um; and the man, not being able to get his money, be|gan to murmur. The other immedi|ately took a hor&s;e-whip to pay him with it, but, by the help of a good pair of heels, the taylor got off. Such oppre&s;|&s;ions as the&s;e made me &s;eek for a ve&s;&s;el to get off the i&s;land as fa&s;t as I could: and by the mercy of God, I found a &s;hip in November bound for England, when I embarked with a con|voy, after having taken a la&s;t farewell of Doctor Irving. When I left Jamaica he was employed in refining &s;ugars; and &s;ome months after my arrival in England I learned, with much &s;orrow, that this my amiable friend was dead, owing to his having eaten &s;ome poi|&s;oned fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We had many very heavy gales of wind in our pa&s;&s;age; in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="224" REF="225">
which no material incident occurred, except that an American privateer, falling in with the fleet, was captured and &s;et &s;ire to by his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Squirrel.</P>
<P>On January the &s;eventh, 1777, we arrived at Plymouth. I was happy once more to tread upon Engli&s;h ground; and, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome little time at Plymouth and Exeter, among &s;ome pious friends, whom I was hap|py to &s;ee, I went to London with a heart replete with thanks to God for pa&s;t mercies.</P>

<P>SUCH were the various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which I was a witne&s;s to, and the fertune I experienced until the year 1777. Since that period, my life has been more uni|form, and the incidents of it fewer, than in any other equal number of years preceding; I therefore ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of a narrative, which I
<PB N="226" REF="227">
fear the reader may think already &s;uf|ficiently tedious.</P>
<P>I had &s;uffered &s;o many impo&s;itions in my commercial tran&s;actions in dif|ferent parts of the world, that I became heartily di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;eafaring life, and was determined not to re|turn to it, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. I therefore once more engaged in &s;ervice &s;hortly after my return, and continued for the mo&s;t part in this &s;ituation until 1784.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival in London, I &s;aw a remarkable circum&s;tance relative to African complexion, which I thought &s;o extraordinary, that I beg leave ju&s;t to mention it: A white negro woman, that I had formerly &s;een in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom &s;he had three boys, and they were every one mullattoes, and yet they had fine light hair. In 1779,
<PB N="227" REF="228">
I &s;erved Governor Macnamara, who had been a con&s;iderable time on the coa&s;t of Africa. In the time of my &s;ervice, I u&s;ed to a&s;k frequently other &s;ervants to join me in family prayer; but this only excited their mockery. However, the Governor, under&s;tanding that I was of a religious turn, wi&s;hed to know what religion I was of; I told him I was a prote&s;tant of the church of England, agreeable to the thirty|nine articles of that church; and that whom&s;oever I found to preach accord|ing to that doctrine, tho&s;e I would hear. A few days after this, we had &s;ome more di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ame &s;ubject; when he &s;aid he would, if I cho&s;e, as he thought I might be of &s;ervice in converting my countrymen to the Go&s;pel faith, get me &s;ent out as mi&s;&s;ionary to Africa. I at fir&s;t refu&s;ed going, and told him how I had been &s;erved on a like occa|&s;ion
<PB N="228" REF="229">
by &s;ome white people the la&s;t voyage I went to Jamaica, when I at|tempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means of converting the Indian prince; and &s;aid I &s;uppo&s;ed they would &s;erve me wor&s;e than Alexander the copper&s;mith did St. Paul, if I &s;hould attempt to go among&s;t them in Africa. He told me not to fear, for he would apply to the Bi&s;hop of London to get me ordained. On the&s;e terms I con|&s;ented to the Governor's propo&s;al to go to Africa in hope of doing good, if po&s;&s;ible, among&s;t my countrymen; &s;o, in order to have me &s;ent out properly, we immediately wrote the following letters to the late Bi&s;hop of London:</P>

With the&s;e letters, I waited on the Bi&s;hop by the Governor's de&s;ire, and pre&s;ented them to his Lord&s;hip. He received me with much conde&s;cen&s;ion and politene&s;s; but, from &s;ome certain &s;cruples of delicacy, and &s;aying the Bi&s;hops were not of opinion of &s;end|ing a new mi&s;&s;ionary to Africa, he de|clined to ordain me.</P>
<P>My &s;ole motive for thus dwelling on this tran&s;action, or in&s;erting the&s;e pa|pers, is the opinion which gentlemen of &s;en&s;e and education, who are ac|quainted with Africa, entertain of the probability of converting the inhabit|ants of it to the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if the attempt were countenanced by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Shortly after this I left the Governor, and &s;erved a nobleman in the Dor&s;et|&s;hire militia, whith whom I was en|camped at Coxheath for &s;ome time;
<PB N="234" REF="235">
but the operations there were too mi|nute and unintere&s;ting to make a de|tail of.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, I vi&s;ited eight counties in Wales, from motives of curio&s;ity. While I was in that part of the country I was led to go down into a coal-pit in Shrop&s;hire, but my curi|o&s;ity nearly co&s;t me my life; for while I was in the pit the coals fell in, and buried one poor man, who was not far from me: upon this I got out as fa&s;t as I could, thinking the furface of the earth the &s;afe&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1784, I thought of vi&s;iting old ocean again. In con&s;e|quence of this I embarked as &s;teward on board a fine new &s;hip called the London, commanded by Martin Hop|kin, and &s;ailed for New-York. I ad|mired this city very much; it is large and well-built, and abounds with pro|vi&s;ions
<PB N="235" REF="236">
of all kinds. While we lay here a circum&s;tance happened which I thought extremely &s;ingular:&mdash;One day a malefactor was to be executed on a gallows; but with a condition that if any woman, having nothing on but her &s;hift, married the man under the gal|lows, his life was to be &s;aved. This extraordinary privilege was claimed; a woman pre&s;ented her&s;elf; and the marriage ceremony was performed.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip having got laden were turn|ed to London in January 1785. When &s;he was ready again for another voyage, the captain being an agreeable man, I &s;ailed with him from hence in the &s;pring, March 1785, for Philadelphia. On the 5th of April, we took our de|parture from the land's-end, with a plea&s;ant gale; and about nine o'clock that night the moon &s;hone bright, and the &s;ea was &s;mooth, while our &s;hip
<PB N="236" REF="237">
was going free by the wind, at the rate of about four or five miles an hour.&mdash;At this time another &s;hip was going nearly as fa&s;t as we on the oppo&s;ite point, meeting us right in the teeth, yet none on board ob&s;erved either &s;hip until we &s;truck each other forcibly head and head, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and con&s;ternation of both crews. She did us much damage, but I believe we did her more; for when we pa&s;&s;ed by each other, which we did very quick|ly, they called to us to bring to, and hoi&s;t out our boat, but we had enough to do to mind our&s;elves; and in about eight minutes we &s;aw no more of her. We refitted as well as we could the next day, and proceeded on our voyage, and in May arrived at Philadelphia.</P>

<P>In October 1585, I was accompanied by &s;ome of the Africans, and pre&s;ented this addre&s;s of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or Quakers, in Grace|church-Court, Lombard-Street:</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>By reading your book, en|titled a Caution to Great Britain and
<PB N="238" REF="239">
her Colonies, concerning the Calamit|ous State of the en&s;laved Negroes: We part of the poor, oppre&s;&s;ed, needy, and much degraded negroes, de&s;ire to ap|proach you with this addre&s;s of thanks, with our inmo&s;t love and warme&s;t ac|knowledgment; and with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of your benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interpo&s;ition, towards breaking the yoke of &s;lavery, and to admini&s;ter a little comfort and ea&s;e to thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of very grievou&s;ly afflicted, and too heavy burthened negroes.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, could you, by per&s;e|verance, at la&s;t be enabled under God, to lighten in any degree the heavy bur|then of the afflicted, no doubt it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be the po&s;&s;ible means, under God, of &s;aving the &s;ouls of many of the oppre&s;&s;ors; and if &s;o, &s;ure we are that the God, who&s;e eyes are ever upon
<PB N="239" REF="240">
all his creatures, and always rewards every true act of virtue, and regards the prayers of the oppre&s;&s;ed, will give to you and yours tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which it is not in our power to expre&s;s or con|ceive, but which we as a part of tho&s;e captivated, oppre&s;&s;ed, and afflicted peo|ple, mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h and pray for.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen received us very kindly, with a promi&s;e to exert them|&s;elves on behalf of the oppre&s;&s;ed Afri|cans, and we parted.</P>
<P>While in town, I chanced once to be invited to a quaker's wedding. The &s;imple and yet expre&s;&s;ive mode u&s;ed at their &s;olemnizations is worthy of note. The following is the true form of it:</P>
<P>After the company have met, they have &s;ea&s;onable exhortations by &s;everal of the members; the bride and bride|groom &s;tand up, and, taking each other
<PB N="240" REF="241">
by the hand in a &s;olemn manner, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> declares to this purpo&s;e:</P>

Then the two fir&s;t &s;ign their names to the record, and as many more witne&s;&s;es as have a mind. I had the honour to &s;ub&s;cribe mine to a regi&s;|ter in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-Street.&mdash;My hand is ever free&mdash;if any female Debonair wi&s;hes to obtain it, this mode I recommend.</P>
<P>We returned to London in Augu&s;t; and our &s;hip not going immediately to &s;ea, I &s;hipped as a &s;teward in an Ame|rican &s;hip called the Harmony, Captain
<PB N="241" REF="242">
John Willet, and left London in March 1786, bound to Philadelphia. Eleven days after &s;ailing, we carried our fore|ma&s;t away. We had a nine weeks pa&s;|&s;age, which cau&s;ed our trip not to &s;uc|ceed well, the market for our goods proving bad; and to make it wor&s;e, my commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often practi&s;e on free negroes in the We&s;t Indies. But I thank God I found many friends here, who in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevented him. On my return to London in Augu&s;t, I was very agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the benevolence of govern|ment had adopted the plan of &s;ome philanthropic individuals to &s;end the Africans from hence to their native quarter; and that &s;ome ve&s;&s;els were then engaged to carry them to Sierra Leona; an act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its promo|tion,
<PB N="242" REF="243">
and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing. There was then in the city, a &s;elect committee of gentlemen for the black poor, to &s;ome of whom I had the honour of being known; and, as &s;oon as they heard of my arrival, they &s;ent for me to the committee. When I came there, they informed me of the intention of government; and as they &s;eemed to think me qualified to &s;uper|intend part of the undertaking, they a&s;ked me to go with the black poor to Africa. I pointed out to them many objections to my going; and particu|larly I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome difficulties on the account of the &s;lave dealers, as I would certainly oppo&s;e their traffic in the hu|man &s;pecies by every means in my power. However the&s;e objections were over-ruled by the gentlemenof the com|mittee, who prevailed on me to con&s;ent to go; and recommended me to the ho|nourable

<P>I proceeded immediately to the exe|cuting of my duty on board the ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined for the voyage, where I con|tinued till the March following.</P>
<P>During my continuanee in the em|ployment of government, I was &s;truck with the flagrant abu&s;es committed by the agent, and endeavoured to remedy
<PB N="246" REF="247">
them, but without effect. One in&s;tance, among many which I could produce, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen. Government had ordered to be provided all nece&s;|&s;aries (&s;lops, as they are called, includ|ed) for 750 per&s;ons; however, not being able to mu&s;ter more than 426, I was ordered to &s;end the &s;uperfluous &s;lops, &amp;c. to the king's &s;tores at Port&s;|mouth; but, when I demanded them for that purpo&s;e from the agent, it appeared they had never been bought, though paid for by government. But that was not all, government were not the only objects of peculation; the&s;e poor people &s;uffered infinitely more; their accom|modations, were mo&s;t wretched; many of them wanted beds, and many more cloathing and other nece&s;&s;aries. For the truth of this, and much more, I do not &s;eek credit from my own a&s;&s;ertion. I appeal to the te&s;timony of Capt.
<PB N="247" REF="248">
Thomp&s;on, of the Nautilus, who con|voyed us, to whom I applied in Feb|ruary 1787, for a remedy, when I had remon&s;trated to the agent in vain, and even brought him to be a witne&s;s of the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion I complained of. I appeal al&s;o to a letter written by the&s;e wretched people, &s;o early as the beginning of the preceding January, and publi&s;hed in the Morning Herald, on the 4th of that month, &s;igned by twenty of their chiefs.</P>
<P>I could not &s;ilently &s;uffer govern|ment to be thus cheated, and my coun|trymen plundered and oppre&s;&s;ed, and even le&s;t de&s;titude of the nece&s;&s;aries for almo&s;t their exi&s;tence. I therefore in|formed the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy of the agent's proceeding; but my di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion was &s;oon after procured, by means of a gentleman in the city, whom the agent, con&s;cious of his peculation,
<PB N="248" REF="249">
had deceived by letter, and who, moreover, empowered the &s;ame agent to receive on board, at the government expence, a number of per&s;ons as pa&s;|&s;engers, contrary to the orders I receiv|ed. By this I &s;uffered a con&s;iderable lo&s;s in my property: however, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners were &s;atisfied with my con|duct, and wrote to Capt. Thomp&s;on, expre&s;&s;ing their opprobation of it.</P>
<P>Thus provided, they proceeded on their voyage; and at la&s;t, worn out by treatment, perhaps not the mo&s;t mild, and wa&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s, brought on by want of medicine, cloaths, bedding, &amp;c. they reached Sirrea Leona ju&s;t at at the commencement of the rains. At that &s;ea&s;on of the year it is impo&s;|&s;ible to cultivate the lands; their pro|vi&s;ions therefore were exhau&s;ted before they could derive any benefit from agriculture; and it is not &s;urpri&s;ing
<PB N="249" REF="250">
that many, e&s;pecially the la&s;cars, who&s;e con&s;titutions are very tender, and who had been cooped up in &s;hips from October to June, and accommodated in the manner I have mentioned, &s;hould be &s;o wa&s;ted by their confinement as not long to &s;urvive it.</P>
<P>Thus ended my part of the long-talked of expedition to Sierra Leona; an expedition which, however unfor|tunate in the event, was humane and politic in its de&s;ign, nor was its failure owing to government: every thing was done on their part; but there was evi|dently &s;ufficient mi&s;management at|tending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have been &s;o ample in my account of this tran&s;action, had not the &s;hare I bore in it been made the &s;ubject of partial animadver&s;ion, and even my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from my employ|ment

The abolition of &s;lavery, &s;o diabolical, will give a mo&s;t rapid ex|ten&s;ion of manufactures, which is to|tally and diametrically oppo&s;ite to what &s;ome intere&s;ted people a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265">
The manufactures of this country mu&s;t and will, in the nature and rea&s;on of things, have a full and con&s;tant em|ploy by &s;upplying the African mar|kets.</P>
<P>Population, the bowels and &s;urface of Africa, abound in valuable and u&s;e|ful returns; the hidden trea&s;ures of cen|turies will be brought to light and into circulation. Indu&s;try, enterprize, and mining, will have their full &s;cope, pro|portionably as they civilize. In a word, it lays open an endle&s;s field of commerce to the Briti&s;h manufactures and merchant adventurer. The manu|facturing intere&s;t and the general inte|re&s;ts are &s;ynonymous. The abolition of &s;lavery would be in reality an univer&s;al good.</P>
<P>Tortures, murder, and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity, are practi&s;ed upon the poor &s;laves with im|punity.

I hope the &s;lave trade will be aboli&s;hed. I pray it may be an event at hand. The great body of manu&s;ac|turers, uniting in the cau&s;e, will con|&s;iderably facilitate and expedite it; and, as I have already &s;tated, it is mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantially their intere&s;t and advantage, and as &s;uch the nation's at large, (except tho&s;e per&s;ons concerned in the manu|facturing neck-yokes, collars, chains, hand-cuffs, leg-bolts, drags, thumb|&s;crews, iron muzzles, and coffins; cats, &s;courges, and other in&s;truments of tor|ture u&s;ed in the &s;lave trade). In a &s;hort time one &s;entiment alone will prevail, from motives of intere&s;t as well as ju&s;|tice and humanity. Europe contains one hundred and twenty millions of in|habitants. Query&mdash;How many mil|lions doth Africa contain? Suppo&s;ing the Africans, collectively and indivi|dually, to expend 5l. a head in raiment

and furniture yearly when civilized, &amp;c. an immen&s;ity beyond the reach of imagination!</P>
<P>This I conceive to be a theory founded upon facts, and therefore an infallible one. If the blacks were per|mitted to remain in their own country, they would double them&s;elves every fifteen years. In proportion to &s;uch increa&s;e will be the demand for manu|factures. Cotton and indigo grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in mo&s;t parts of Africa; a con&s;ideration this of no &s;mall con|&s;equence to the manufacturing towns of Great Britain. It opens a mo&s;t im|men&s;e, glorious, and happy pro&s;pect&mdash;the clothing, &amp;c. of a continent ten thou&s;and miles in circumference, and immen&s;ely rich in productions of every denomination in return for manufac|tures.</P>

I have only therefore to reque&s;t the reader's indulgence and conclude. I am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this narrative: I hope cen&s;ure will be &s;u&s;pended, when it is con&s;idered that it was written by one who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the plainne&s;s of truth by the colouring of imagination. My life and fortune have been extremely chequered, and my adventures various. Even tho&s;e I have related are con&s;iderably abridged. If any incident in this little work &s;hould appear unintere&s;ting and trifling to mo&s;t readers, I can only &s;ay, as my excu&s;e for mentioning it, that almo&s;t every event of my life made an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, and in|fluenced my conduct. I early accu&s;|tomed my&s;elf to look for the hand of God in the minute&s;t occurrence, and to learn from it a le&s;&s;on of morality
<PB N="268" REF="269">
and religion; and in this light, every circum&s;tance I have related was to me of importance. After all, what makes any event important, unle&s;s by its ob|&s;ervation we become better and wi&s;er, and learn <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?'</Q> To tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;pirit, there is &s;carcely any book or incident &s;o trifling that does not afford &s;ome profit, while to others the experi|ence of ages &s;eems of no u&s;e; and even to pour out to them the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom is throwing the jewels of in|&s;truction away.</P>
