<P>THESE Poems (&s;ome of which, it is pre&s;umed, will be found to have an <HI>original</HI> ca&s;t,) were written partly to divert the Author's mind from reflections of un|plea&s;ing tendency, and partly to relieve it under attention to matters more profe&s;&s;ional, and of much greater importance to the in|tere&s;t of virtue and religion. And he hopes at the &s;ame time a liberal attempt to amu&s;e all &s;orts of readers but immoral ones, will not be le&s;s acceptable to the candid and the &s;en&s;ible, than the bulk of modern produc|tions, which are vi&s;ibly calculated to an&s;wer a mere temporary and ungenerous purpo&s;e; in the gratification of party rage, popular cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, or per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON GENIUS. A NEW EDITION, WITH ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>INQUIRE, di&s;pute, reply, and all you can,</L>
<L>Say, what is GENIUS but the &s;oul of man;&mdash;</L>
<L>Beam of that light which animates our frame,</L>
<L>Alike in many, but in none the &s;ame?</L>
<L>'Tis with our Minds, as with our bodies, none</L>
<L>In e&s;&s;ence differ, yet each knows his own.</L>
<L>Marks of &s;pecific character we &s;ee</L>
<L>That &s;tamp on ev'ry mortal,&mdash;THIS IS HE.</L>
<L>Nor varies more our pre&s;ent outward &s;hape</L>
<L>(This man half-angel, and the next half-ape)</L>
<L>Than do the mental powers: What odds we find</L>
<L>Between a &mdash;'s and a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, the names of many who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their ability will occur; but it will not be expected, that honour &s;hould be done to, or mention made of all the &s;ucce&s;sful candidates for celebrity, in all countries and ages of the world. It will be thought &s;ufficient, 'tis pre&s;umed, for the illu&s;tra|tion of the &s;ubject, to have produced &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent and popular names, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e of our own nation.</NOTE> <HI>Newton</HI>'s mind?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8">A&s;k you the cau&s;e? Fir&s;t take it for a rule&mdash;</L>
<L>Whate'er the man, the &s;oul is not a fool.</L>
<L>She came in due perfection from the &s;kies,</L>
<L>And all defect in gro&s;&s;er body lies.</L>
<L>Body and &s;oul at be&s;t but ill agree;&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis &s;pirit wedded to infirmity:</L>
<L>A di&s;proportion'd match; and hence proceeds</L>
<L>The &s;oul's inaction from the body's needs.</L>
<L>This truth once &s;tate, ev'ry &s;oul, 'tis plain,</L>
<L>Much on the filmy texture of the brain;</L>
<L>Much on formations that e&s;cape our eyes;</L>
<L>On nice connexions, and coherencies;</L>
<L>And on corporeal organs mu&s;t depend,</L>
<L>For her own functions, exerci&s;e, and end.</L>
<L>Hence then the cau&s;e of all defects is &s;een;</L>
<L>For one wrong movement &s;poils the whole machine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis hence the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions take their ri&s;e,</L>
<L>The &s;eeds of virtue, and the roots of vice;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9">Hence notes peculiar or to young, or old,</L>
<L>Phlegmatic, &s;anguine, amorous, or cold;</L>
<L>And hence from con&s;titution, &s;uch or &s;uch,</L>
<L>Wit will take modes, and <HI>Genius</HI> op'rate much.</L>
<L>The youthful bard, a gentle, &s;ighing &s;wain,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Ovid</HI> warbles in a love-&s;ick &s;train;</L>
<L>With weaker pa&s;&s;ions, but with &s;en&s;e more &s;trong.</L>
<L>The melancholy <HI>Young</HI> pur&s;ues his &s;ong.</L>
<L>Mixture of humours motley <HI>Genius</HI> &s;hews;</L>
<L>'Tis &s;een, methinks, in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author means not hereby to throw any re|flection on the literary character of the late ingenious and worthy Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who&s;e MEDITATIONS have done con&s;iderable &s;ervice to religion, and will rank him in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of elegant writers; &mdash; proper allowances made for the enthu&s;ia&s;m with which they are a little tinctured, and for the exuberance of a &s;ometimes too playful imagination.</NOTE> <HI>Hervey</HI>'s dancing pro&s;e.</L>
<L>Why wonder then to mark the &s;ons of rhyme</L>
<L>Gay, &s;erious, turgid, ea&s;y, or &s;ublime?</L>
<L>The &s;oul and body clo&s;ely thus allied,</L>
<L>Vile is the folly as the &s;in of pride;</L>
