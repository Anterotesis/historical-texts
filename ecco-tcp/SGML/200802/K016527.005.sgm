<P>_I Am ju&s;t returned. You will expect me to be particular.</P>
<P>I went the earlier in the afternoon, that I might pa&s;s half an hour with my Jeronymo. He complains of the aperture &s;o lately made: But Mr. Low|ther gives us hopes from it.</P>
<P>When we were alone, They will not let me &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he: I am &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be very bad. But I under&s;tand, that you are to be allowed that favour, by-and-by. O my Grandi&s;on! how I pity that tender, that generous heart of yours!&mdash;But what have you done to the General? He a&s;&s;ures me, that
<PB N="2" REF="3">
he admires and loves you; and the Bi&s;hop has been congratulating <HI>me</HI> upon it. He knew it would give me plea&s;ure. My dear Grandi&s;on, you &s;ubdue every|body; yet in your own way; for they both admire your &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in the General. He &s;aluted me in &s;o kind a manner, that Jeronymo's eyes overflowed; and he &s;aid, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I have lived to &s;ee you two, deare&s;t of men to me, &s;o friendly together.</P>
<P>This &s;weet girl! &s;aid the General:&mdash;How, Gran|di&s;on, will you bear to &s;ee her?</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop entered: O Chevalier! my &s;i&s;ter is in|&s;en&s;ible to every-thing, and every-body. Camilla is nobody with her to-day.</P>
<P>They had forgot Jeronymo, tho' in his chamber; and their attention being taken by his audible &s;en&s;ibi|lities, they comforted him; and withdrew with me into Mr. Lowther's apartment; while Mr. Lowther went to his patient.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s joined us in tears. This dear child knows me not; heeds me not: She never was un|mindful of her mother before. I have talked to her of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on: She regards not your name. O this affecting &s;ilence!&mdash;Camilla has told her, that &s;he is to &s;ee you. My daughter-in-law has told her &s;o. O Chevalier! &s;he has quite, quite lo&s;t her under&s;tanding. Nay, we were barbarous enough to try the name of Laurana. She was not terrified, as &s;he u&s;ed to be, with that.</P>
<P>Camilla came in with a face of joy: Lady Clemen|tina has ju&s;t &s;poken! I told her, &s;he mu&s;t prepare to &s;ee the Chevalier Grandi&s;on in all his glory, and that every-body, the General in particular, admired him. Go, naughty Camilla, &s;aid &s;he, tapping my hand; you are a wicked deceiver. I have been told this &s;tory too often, to credit it. This was all I could get her to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Hence it was concluded, that &s;he would take &s;ome notice of me when &s;he &s;aw me; and I was led
<PB N="3" REF="4">
by the General, followed by the re&s;t, into the Mar|chione&s;s's drawing-room.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti had given me an advantageous character of the General's Lady, whom I had not yet &s;een. The Bi&s;hop had told me, that &s;he was &s;uch another excellent woman as his mother, and, like her, had the Italian re&s;erve &s;oftened by a polite French education, The Marquis, the Count, Father Mare|&s;cotti, and this real fine Lady, were in the drawing|room. The General pre&s;ented me to her. I do not, madam, bid you admire the Chevalier Grandi&s;on: But I forgive you if you do; becau&s;e you will not be able to do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, you told me an hour ago, that I mu&s;t: And now, that I &s;ee the Chevalier, you will have no cau&s;e to reproach me with di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>I bowed on her hand. Father Mare&s;cotti, madam, &s;aid I, bid me expect from the Lady of the young Mar|che&s;e della Porretta every-thing that was conde&s;cend|ing and good. Your compa&s;&s;ionate Love for an un|happy new &s;i&s;ter, who de&s;erves every-one's Love, ex|alts your character.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti came in. We took our places. It was de&s;igned, I found, to try to revive the young Lady's attention, by introducing her in full a&s;&s;embly, I one of it. But I could not forbear a&s;king the Mar|chione&s;s, if Lady Clementina would not be too much &s;tartled at &s;o much company?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, &s;aid the Marquis, &s;ighing, that &s;he <HI>may</HI> be &s;tartled.</P>
<P>We meet, as only on a conver&s;ation-vi&s;it, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s. We have tried every other way to awaken her attention.</P>
<P>We are all near relations, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>And want to make our ob&s;ervations, &s;aid the Ge|neral.</P>
<P>She has been bid to expect you among us, re&s;umed the Marchione&s;s. We &s;hall only be attended by Laura and Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
Ju&s;t then entered the &s;weet Lady, leaning upon Ca|milla, Laura attending. Her movement was &s;low and &s;olemn. Her eyes were ca&s;t on the ground. Her robes were black and flowing. A veil of black gau&s;e half covered her face. What woe was there in it!</P>
<P>What, at that moment, was my emotion! I aro&s;e from my &s;eat, &s;at down, and aro&s;e again, irre&s;olute, not knowing what I did, or what <HI>to</HI> do!</P>
<P>She &s;topt in the middle of the floor, and made &s;ome motion, in &s;ilence, to Camilla, who adju&s;ted her veil: But &s;he looked not before her; lifted not up her eyes; ob&s;erved no-body.</P>
<P>On her &s;topping, I was advancing towards her; but the General took my hand: Sit &s;till, &s;it &s;till, dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he: Yet I am charmed with your &s;en&s;ibility. She comes! She moves towards us!</P>
<P>She approached the table round which we &s;at, her eyes more than half clo&s;ed, and ca&s;t down. She turned to go towards the window. Here, here, madam, &s;aid Camilla, leading her to an elbow-chair that had been placed for her, between the two Marchione&s;&s;es. She implicitly took her woman's directions, and &s;at down. Her mother wept. The young Marchione&s;s wept. Her father &s;obbed; and looked from her. Her mo|ther took her hand: My love, &s;aid &s;he, look around you.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid the Count, her uncle, leave her to her own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>She was regardle&s;s of what either &s;aid; her eyes were ca&s;t down, and half clo&s;ed. Camilla &s;tood at the back of her chair.</P>
<P>The General, grieved and impatient, aro&s;e, and &s;tepping to her, My deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, hanging over her &s;houlder, look upon us all. Do not <HI>&s;corn</HI> us, do not <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> us: See your father, your mother, your &s;i&s;ter, and every-body, in tears. If you love us, &s;mile upon us. He took the hand which her mother had quitted, to attend her own emotions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
She reared up her eyes to him, and, &s;weetly con|de&s;cending, tried to &s;mile; but &s;uch a &s;olemnity had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her features, that &s;he only could &s;hew her obligingne&s;s, by the effort. Her &s;mile was a &s;mile of woe. And, &s;till further to &s;hew her com|pliance, withdrawing her hand from her brother, &s;he looked on either &s;ide of her; and &s;eeing which was her mother, &s;he, with both hands, took hers, and bowed her head upon upon it.</P>
<P>The Marquis aro&s;e from his &s;eat, his handkerchief at his eyes. Sweet creature! &s;aid he, never, never let me again &s;ee &s;uch a &s;mile as that. It is <HI>here,</HI> put|ting his hand to his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Camilla offered her a gla&s;s of limonade; &s;he ac|cepted it not, nor held up her head for a few mo|ments.</P>
<P>Obliging &s;i&s;ter! you do not &s;corn us, &s;aid the Ge|neral. See, Father Mare&s;cotti is in tears [The re|verend man &s;at next me]: Pity his grey hairs! See, my Lord, your own father too&mdash;Comfort your father. <HI>His</HI> grief for your &s;ilence.&mdash;</P>
<P>She ca&s;t her eyes that way. She &s;aw me. Saw me greatly affected. She &s;tarted. She looked again; again &s;tarted; and quitting her mother's hand, now changing pale, now reddening, &s;he aro&s;e, and threw her arms about her Camilla&mdash;O Camilla! was all &s;he &s;aid; a violent bur&s;t of tears wounding, yet giving &s;ome ea&s;e to every heart. I was &s;pringing to her, and &s;hould have cla&s;ped her in my arms before them all; but the General taking my hand, as I reached her chair, Dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, pronouncing in her ear my name, keep your &s;eat. If Clementina re|members her Engli&s;h tutor, &s;he will bid you welcome once more to Bologna.&mdash;O Camilla, &s;aid &s;he, faithful, good Camilla! Now, at la&s;t, have you told me truth! It is, it is he!&mdash;And her tears <HI>would</HI> flow, as &s;he hid her face in Camilla's bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The General's native pride again &s;hewed it&s;elf. He
<PB N="6" REF="7">
took me a&s;ide. I &s;ee, Grandi&s;on, the con&s;equence you are of to this unhappy girl: Every one &s;ees it. But I depend upon your honour: You remember what you &s;aid this morning&mdash;</P>
<P>Good God! &s;aid I, with &s;ome emotion: I &s;topt&mdash;And re&s;uming, with pride equal to his own, Know, Sir, that the man whom you thus remind, calls him|&s;elf a man of honour; and you, as well as the re&s;t of the world, &s;hall find him &s;o.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed a little aba&s;hed. I was flinging from him, not too angrily for <HI>him,</HI> but for the re&s;t of the com|pany, had they not been attentive to the motions of their Clementina.</P>
<P>We, however, took the Bi&s;hop's eye. He came to us.</P>
<P>I left the General; and the Bi&s;hop led him out, in order to enquire into the occa&s;ion of my warmth.</P>
<P>When I turned to the company, I found the dear Clementina, &s;upported by the two Marchione&s;&s;es, and attended by Camilla, ju&s;t by me, pa&s;&s;ing towards the door, in order, it &s;eems, at <HI>her</HI> motion, to withdraw. She &s;topt. Ah, Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he; and reclining her head on her mother's bo&s;om, &s;eemed ready to faint. I took one hand, as it hung down lifele&s;sly extended (her mother held the other); and, kneeling, pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips&mdash;Forgive me, Ladies; forgive me, Lady Clementina!&mdash;My &s;oul overflowed with ten|derne&s;s, tho' the moment before it was in a tumult of another kind; for &s;he ca&s;t down her eyes upon me with a benignity, that for a long time they all after|wards owned they had not beheld. I could not &s;ay more. I aro&s;e. She moved on to the door; and when there, turned her head, &s;training her neck to look after me, till &s;he was out of the room. I was a &s;tatue for a few moments; till the Count, &s;natching my hand, and Father Mare&s;cotti's, who &s;tood neare&s;t him, We &s;ee to what the malady is owing&mdash;Father, you mu&s;t join their hands!&mdash;Chevalier! you will be
<PB N="7" REF="8">
a Catholic!&mdash;Will you not?&mdash;O that you would! &s;aid the Father&mdash;Why, why, joined in the Count, did we refu&s;e the &s;o-earne&s;tly reque&s;ted interview, a year and half ago?</P>
<P>The young Marchione&s;s returned, weeping&mdash;They will not permit me to &s;tay. My &s;i&s;ter, my dear &s;i&s;ter, is in fits!&mdash;O Sir, turning graciou&s;ly to me, you <HI>are</HI>&mdash;I will not &s;ay <HI>what</HI> you are&mdash;But I &s;hall not be is danger of di&s;obeying my Lord, on your account.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then entered the General, led in by the Bi&s;hop. Now, brother, &s;aid the latter, if you will not be ge|nerous, be, however, ju&s;t&mdash;Chevalier, Were you not a little ha&s;ty?</P>
<P>I <HI>was,</HI> my Lord. But &s;urely the General was un|&s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Perhaps I was.</P>
<P>There is as great a triumph, my Lord, &s;aid I, in a due acknowlegement, as in a victory. Know me, my Lords, as a man incapable of meanne&s;s; who will a&s;&s;ert him&s;elf; but who, from the knowlege he has of his own heart, wi&s;hes at his &s;oul to be received as the unque&s;tionably di&s;intere&s;ted friend of this whole family. Excu&s;e me, my Lords, I am obliged to talk greatly, becau&s;e I would not wi&s;h to act petulantly. But my &s;oul is wounded by tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which had not, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, a little while ago, a fir&s;t place in <HI>your</HI> heart.</P>
<P>Do you reproach me, Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>I need not, my Lord, if you <HI>feel</HI> it as &s;uch. But indeed you either know not me, or forget your&s;elf. And now, having &s;poken all my mind, I am ready to a&s;k your pardon for any-thing that may have offended you in the manner. I &s;natched his hand &s;o &s;uddenly, I hope not rudely, but rather fervently, that he &s;tarted&mdash;Receive me, my Lord, as a Friend. I will <HI>de&s;erve</HI> your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Tell me, brother, &s;aid he to the Bi&s;hop, what I &s;hall &s;ay to this &s;trange man? Shall I be angry or plea&s;ed?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
Be plea&s;ed, my Lord, replied the Prelate.</P>
<P>The General embraced me&mdash;Well, Grandi&s;on, you have overcome. I <HI>was</HI> un&s;ea&s;onable. You were pa&s;&s;ionate. Let us forgive each other.</P>
<P>His Lady &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, not being able to gue&s;s at the occa&s;ion of this behaviour, and renewed friend|&s;hip. The Count was equally &s;urpri&s;ed. Father Mare&s;cotti &s;eemed al&s;o at a lo&s;s. The Marquis had withdrawn.</P>
<P>We &s;at down, and rea&s;oned variou&s;ly on what had pa&s;&s;ed, with regard to the unhappy Lady, according to the hopes and fears which actuated the bo&s;oms of each. But I cannot help thinking, that had this interview been allowed to pa&s;s with le&s;s &s;urprize to her, &s;he might have been &s;pared tho&s;e fits, with the affecting de&s;cription of which the young Marchione&s;s alarmed us, till Camilla came in with the happy news, that &s;he was recovering from them; and that her mother was promi&s;ing her another vi&s;it from me, in hopes it would oblige her; tho' it was not what &s;he required.</P>
<P>I took this opportunity to put into the hands of the young Marchione&s;s, &s;ealed up, the opinions of the phy&s;icians I had con&s;ulted in England, on the ca&s;e of Clementina; reque&s;ting that &s;he would give it to her mother, in order to have it con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop withdrew, to acquaint Jeronymo, in the way he thought be&s;t, with what had pa&s;&s;ed in this fir&s;t interview with his &s;i&s;ter; re&s;olving not to take any notice of the little &s;ally of warmth between the General and me.</P>
<P>I hope to make the pride and pa&s;&s;ion of this young nobleman of u&s;e to my&s;elf, by way of caution: For am I not naturally too much inclined to the &s;ame fault? O Dr. Bartlett! how have I regretted the pa&s;&s;ion I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be betray'd into, by the fooli&s;h violence of O'Hara and Salmonet, in my own hou&s;e, when it would have better become me, to have had them &s;hewed out of it by my &s;ervants!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
And yet, were I to receive affronts with tamene&s;s from tho&s;e haughty &s;pirits, who think them&s;elves of a rank &s;uperior to me, and from men of the &s;word, I, who make it a principle not to draw mine but in my own defence, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to in&s;ults, that would be continually involving me in the difficulties I am &s;olicitous to avoid.</P>
<P>I attended the General and his Lady to Jeronymo. The generous youth forgot his own weak &s;tate, in the hopes he flatter'd him&s;elf with, of a happy re&s;ult to his &s;i&s;ter's malady, from the change of &s;ymptoms which had already taken place; tho' violent hy&s;terics di&s;order'd and &s;hook her before-wounded frame.</P>
<P>The General &s;aid, that if &s;he could overcome this fir&s;t &s;hock, perhaps it was the be&s;t method that could have been taken to rou&s;e her out of that &s;tupidity and inattention which had been for &s;ome weeks &s;o di&s;turb|ing to them all.</P>
<P>There were no hopes of &s;eeing the unhappy Lady again that evening. The General would have ac|companied me to the Ca&s;ino <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Ca&s;ino at Bologna is a fine apartment, illuminated every night, for the entertainment of the gentlemen and ladies of the city, and whomever they plea&s;e to introduce.

My heart was full of anxiety, for the welfare of a brother and &s;i&s;ter, both &s;o much endeared to me by their calamities: And I retired to my lodgings.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER II.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Tue&s;day, May <HI>16-27.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had a very re&s;tle&s;s night; and found my&s;elf &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed in the morning, with a feveri&s;h di&s;order, that I thought of contenting my&s;elf with &s;end|ing to know how the brother and &s;i&s;ter re&s;ted, and of &s;taying within, at lea&s;t till the afternoon, to give my hurried &s;pirits &s;ome little repo&s;e: But my me&s;|&s;enger returned with a reque&s;t from the Marchione&s;s, to &s;ee me pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I obeyed. Clementina had a&s;ked, Whether &s;he had really &s;een me, or had only dreamed &s;o. They took this for a favourable indication; and therefore &s;ent the above reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I met the General in Jeronymo's apartment. He took notice that I was not very well. Mr. Lowther propo&s;ed to bleed me. I con&s;ented. I afterwards &s;aw my friend's wounds dre&s;&s;ed. The three &s;urgeons pro|nounced appearances not to be unfavourable.</P>
<P>We all then retired into Mr. Lowther's apartment. The Bi&s;hop introduced to us two of the faculty. The pre&s;criptions of the Engli&s;h phy&s;icians were con|&s;idered; and &s;ome of the methods approved, and agreed to be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Clementina, when I came, was retired to her own apartment with Camilla. Her terrors on Laurana's cruelty had again got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her imagination; and they thought it not advi&s;eable that I &s;hould be admitted into her pre&s;ence, till the hurries &s;he was in, on that account, had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>But by this time, being a little more compo&s;ed, her mother led her into her dre&s;&s;ing-room. The Gene|neral, and his Lady were both pre&s;ent; and, by their de&s;ire, I was a&s;ked to walk in.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Clementina, when I entered, was &s;itting clo&s;e to Camilla; her head leaning on her bo&s;om, &s;ilent, and, &s;eemingly, thoughtful. I bowed to her, to the two Marchione&s;&s;es, to the General. She rai&s;ed her head, and looked towards me; and cla&s;ping her arms about Camilla's neck, hid her face in her bo&s;om for a few moments; then, looking as ba&s;hful towards me, &s;he loo&s;ed her hands, &s;tood up, and looked &s;teadily at me, and at Camilla, by turns, &s;everal times, as irre&s;olute. At la&s;t, quitting Camilla, &s;he moved towards me with a &s;tealing pace; but when near me, turning &s;hort, hur|ried to her mother; and putting one arm about her neck, the other held up, &s;he looked at me, as if &s;he were doubtful whom &s;he &s;aw. She &s;eemed to whi&s;per to her mother, but not to be under&s;tood. She went then by her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, who took her hand as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her, with both hers, and ki&s;&s;ed it; and coming to the General, who &s;at &s;till nearer me, and who had de&s;ired me to attend to her motions, &s;he &s;tood by him, and looked at me with a &s;weet irre&s;olution.</P>
<P>As &s;he had &s;tolen &s;uch advances towards me, I could no longer re&s;train my&s;elf. I aro&s;e, and, taking her hand, Behold the man, &s;aid I, with a bent knee, whom once you honour'd with the name of tutor, your Eng|li&s;h tutor!&mdash;Know you not the grateful Grandi&s;on, whom all your family have honoured with their regard?</P>
<P>O yes!&mdash;Yes,&mdash;I think I do.&mdash;They rejoiced to hear her &s;peak.&mdash;But where have you been all this time?</P>
<P>In England, madam&mdash;But returned, <HI>lately</HI> returned, to vi&s;it you and your Jeronymo.</P>
<P>Jeronymo! one hand held up; the other not with|drawn. Poor Jeronymo!</P>
<P>God be prai&s;ed! &s;aid the General: Some faint hopes. The two Marchione&s;&s;es wept for joy.</P>
<P>Your Jeronymo, madam, and my Jeronymo, is, we hope, in a happy way. Do you love Jeronymo?</P>
<P>Do I!&mdash;But what of Jeronymo? I don't under&s;tand you.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
Jeronymo, now you are well, will be happy.</P>
<P>Am I well? Ah, Sir!&mdash;But &s;ave me, &s;ave me, Chevalier!&mdash;faintly &s;creaming, and looking about her, with a countenance of woe and terror.</P>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> &s;ave you, madam. The General will al&s;o protect you. Of whom are you afraid?</P>
<P>O the cruel, cruel Laurana!&mdash;She withdrew her hand in a hurry, and lifted up the &s;leeve of the other arm&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee&mdash;O I have been cruelly u&s;ed&mdash;But you will protect me. Forbearing to &s;hew her arm, as &s;he &s;eemed to intend.</P>
<P>Laurana &s;hall never more come near you.</P>
<P>But don't hurt her!&mdash;Come, &s;it down by me, and I will tell you all I have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>She hurried to her former &s;eat; and &s;at down by her weeping Camilla. I followed her. She motion|ed to me to &s;it down by her.</P>
<P>Why, you mu&s;t know, Chevalier&mdash;She pau&s;ed&mdash;Ah my head! putting her hand to it&mdash;Well, but, now you mu&s;t leave me. Something is wrong&mdash;Leave me&mdash;I don't know my&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>Then looking with a face of averted terror at me&mdash;You are not the &s;ame man I talked to ju&s;t now!&mdash;Who <HI>are</HI> you, Sir?&mdash;She again faintly &s;hrieked, and threw her arms about Camilla's neck, once more hide|ing her face in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I could not bear this. Not very well before, it was too much for me. I withdrew.</P>
<P>Don't withdraw, Chevalier, &s;aid the General, dry|ing his eyes.</P>
<P>I withdrew, however, to Mr. Lowther's chamber. He not being there, I &s;hut the door upon my&s;elf&mdash;So oppre&s;&s;ed! my dear Dr. Bartlett, I was greatly oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Recovering my&s;elf in a few moments, I went to Jeronymo. I had but ju&s;t entered his chamber, when the General, who &s;eemed unable to &s;peak, took my hand, and in &s;ilence led me to his mother's dre&s;&s;ing|room. As we entered it, She enquires after you,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Chevalier, &s;aid he, and laments your departure. She thinks &s;he has offended you. Thank God, &s;he has recollection!</P>
<P>When I went in, &s;he was in her mother's arms; her mother &s;oothing her, and weeping over her.</P>
<P>See, &s;ee, my child, the Chevalier! you have <HI>not</HI> offended him.</P>
<P>She quitted her mother's arms. I approached her. I thought it was not <HI>you</HI> that &s;at by me, a while ago. But when you went away from me, I &s;aw it could be nobody but you. Why did you go away? Was you angry?</P>
<P>I could not be angry, madam. You bid me leave you: And I obeyed.</P>
<P>Well, but now what &s;hall I &s;ay to him, madam? I don't know what I would &s;ay. You, madam, &s;tepping with a ha&s;ty motion towards her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, will not tell Laurana any-thing again&s;t me?</P>
<P>Unhappy hour, &s;aid her mother, &s;peaking to the General, that I ever yielded to her going to the cruel Laurana!</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s took her hand; I hate Laurana, my dear; I love nobody but you.</P>
<P>Don't hate her, however&mdash;Chevalier, whi&s;peringly, Who is this Lady?</P>
<P>The General rejoiced at the que&s;tion; for this was the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever taken any particular notice of his Lady, or enquired who &s;he was, notwith&s;tand|ing her generous tenderne&s;s to her.</P>
<P>That Lady is your &s;i&s;ter, your brother Signor Gia|como's wife&mdash;</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter! how can that be?&mdash;Where has &s;he been all this time?</P>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter by marriage: Your elder brother's wife.</P>
<P>I don't under&s;tand it. But why, madam, did you not tell me &s;o before? I wi&s;h you happy. Laurana would not let me be <HI>her</HI> cou&s;in. Will <HI>you</HI> own me?</P>
<P>The young Marchione&s;s cla&s;p'd her arms about her. My &s;i&s;ter, my friend, my dear Clementina! Call me your &s;i&s;ter, and I &s;hall be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
What &s;trange things have come to pa&s;s?</P>
<P>How did the&s;e dawnings of rea&s;on rejoice every one!</P>
<P>Sir, turning to the General, let me &s;peak with you.</P>
<P>She led him by the hand to the other end of the room&mdash;Let nobody hear us, &s;aid &s;he: Yet &s;poke not low. What had I to &s;ay?&mdash;I had &s;omething to &s;ay to you very earne&s;tly. I don't know what&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, don't puzzle your&s;elf, my dear, to recollect it, &s;aid the General. Your new &s;i&s;ter loves you. She is the be&s;t of women. She is the joy of my life. Love your new &s;i&s;ter, my Clementina.</P>
<P>So I will. Don't I love every-body?</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t love her better than any other woman, the be&s;t of mothers excepted. She is <HI>my</HI> wife, and <HI>your</HI> &s;i&s;ter; and &s;he loves both you, and our dear Je|ronymo.</P>
<P>And no-body el&s;e? Does &s;he love no-body el&s;e?</P>
<P>Whom el&s;e would you have her love?</P>
<P>I don't know. But every-body, I think; for I do.</P>
<P>Whomever you love, &s;he will love. She is all goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Why that's well. I will love her, now I know who &s;he is. But, Sir, I have &s;ome notion&mdash;</P>
<P>Of what, my dear?</P>
<P>I don't know. But pray, Sir, What brings the Chevalier over hither again?</P>
<P>To comfort you, your father, mother, Jeronymo: To comfort us all. To make us all well, and happy in each other.</P>
<P>Why that's very good. Don't <HI>you</HI> think &s;o? But he was always good. Are you, brother, happy?</P>
<P>I am, and &s;hould be more &s;o, if you and Jeronymo were.</P>
<P>But that can never, never be.</P>
<P>God forbid! my &s;i&s;ter. The Chevalier has brought over with him a &s;kilful man, who hopes to cure our Jeronymo&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
Has the Chevalier done this? Why did he not do &s;o before?</P>
<P>The General was a little di&s;concerted; but ge|nerou&s;ly &s;aid, We were wrong; we took not right me|thods. I, for my part, wi&s;h we had followed his advice in every-thing.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me!&mdash;holding up one hand. How came all the&s;e things about! Sir, Sir, with quickne&s;s&mdash;I will come again pre&s;ently&mdash;And was making to the door.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;tept to her&mdash;Whither, whither, my dear young Lady?&mdash;O! Camilla will do as well&mdash;Ca|milla, laying her hand upon her &s;houlder, go to Father Mare&s;cotti&mdash;Tell him&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt: Then proceeding, Tell him, I have &s;een a vi&s;ion&mdash;He &s;hall pray for us all.</P>
<P>Then &s;tepping to her mother, and taking her pa&s;&s;ive hand, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed it, and &s;troked her own forehead and cheek with it&mdash;Love me, madam, love your child. <HI>You</HI> don't know, neither do I, what ails my poor head. Heal it! Heal it! with your gentle hand! Again &s;troking her forehead with it; then putting it to her heart.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, ki&s;&s;ing her forehead, made her face wet with her tears.</P>
<P>Shall I, &s;aid Camilla, go to Father Mare&s;cotti?</P>
<P>No, &s;aid the General, except &s;he repeats her com|mands. Perhaps &s;he has forgot him already.&mdash;She &s;aid no more of Father Mare&s;cotti.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s thinks that &s;he had &s;ome confu&s;ed notions of the former enmity of the General and Father to me; and finding the former reconciled, wanted the Father to be &s;o too, and to pray for us all.</P>
<P>I was willing, my dear Dr. Bartlett, to give you minutely the workings of the poor Lady's mind on our two fir&s;t interviews. Every-body is rejoiced at &s;o hopeful an alteration already.</P>
<P>We all thought it be&s;t, now, that &s;he had &s;o &s;ur|pri&s;ingly taken a turn, from ob&s;erving a profound
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;ilence, to free talking, and &s;hewn her&s;elf able, with very little incoherence, to pur&s;ue a di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he &s;hould not exhau&s;t her&s;elf; and Camilla was di|rected to court her into her own dre&s;&s;ing-room, and endeavour to engage her on &s;ome indifferent &s;ubjects. I a&s;ked her leave to withdraw: She gave it me readily, with the&s;e words, I &s;hall &s;ee you again, I hope, be|fore you go to England.</P>
<P>Often, I hope, very often, an&s;wered the General for me.</P>
<P>That is very good, &s;aid &s;he; and, courte&s;ying to me, went up with Camilla.</P>
<P>We all went into Jeronymo's apartment; and the young Marchione&s;s rejoiced him with the relation of what had pa&s;&s;ed. That generous friend was for a&s;|cribing to my pre&s;ence the hoped-for happy alteration; while the General declared, that he never would have her contradicted for the future, in any rea&s;onable re|que&s;t &s;he &s;hould make.</P>
<P>The Count her uncle, and Signor Seba&s;tiano his elde&s;t Son, are &s;et out for Urbino. They took leave of me at my lodgings. He hoped, he &s;aid, that all would be happy; and that I would be a Catholic.</P>
<P>I HAVE received a large pacquet of Letters from England.</P>
<P>I approve of all you propo&s;e, my dear Dr. Bartlett. You &s;hall not, you &s;ay, be ea&s;y, except I will in&s;pect your accounts. Don't refu&s;e to give your own worthy heart any &s;atisfaction that it can receive, by con&s;ult|ing your true friend: But otherwi&s;e, you need not a&s;k my con&s;ent to any-thing you &s;hall think &s;it to do. Of one thing, methinks, I could be glad, that only &s;uch children of the poor, as &s;hew a peculiar inge|nuity, have any great pains taken with them in their <HI>books.</HI> Hu&s;bandry and labour are what are mo&s;t want|ing to be encouraged among the lower cla&s;s of people. Providence has given to men different genius's and
<PB N="17" REF="18">
capacities, for different ends; and that all might be|come u&s;eful links of the &s;ame great chain. Let us apply tho&s;e talents to Labour, tho&s;e to Learning, tho&s;e to Trade, to Mechanics, in their different branches, which point out the different pur&s;uits, and then no per&s;on will be unu&s;eful; on the contrary, every one may be eminent in &s;ome way or other. Learning, of it&s;elf, never made any man happy. The plough|man makes fewer mi&s;takes in the conduct of life than the &s;cholar, becau&s;e the &s;phere in which he moves is a more contracted one. But if a genius ari&s;es, let us en|courage it: There will be ru&s;tics enough to do the common &s;ervices for the finer &s;pirits, and to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, if we do not, by our own indi&s;criminate good offices, contribute to their mi&s;|application.</P>
<P>I will write to congratulate Lord W. and his Lady. I rejoice exceedingly in their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o write to my Beauchamp, and to Lady Beauchamp, to give her joy on her enlarged heart. Surely, Dr. Bartlett, human nature is not &s;o bad a thing, as &s;ome di&s;gracers of their own &s;pecies have imagined. I have, on many occa&s;ions, found, that it is but applying properly to the pa&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons, who, tho' they have not been very remarkable for benevolence, may yet be induced to do right things in <HI>&s;ome</HI> manner, if not always in the <HI>mo&s;t graceful.</HI> But as it is an ob&s;ervation, that the mi&s;er's fea&s;t is often the mo&s;t &s;plendid; &s;o may we &s;ay, as in the ca&s;es of Lord W. and Lady Beauchamp, the one to her &s;on|in-law, the other to his Lady and nieces, that when &s;uch per&s;ons are brought to ta&s;te the &s;weets of a ge|nerous and beneficent action, they are able to behave greatly. We &s;hould not too &s;oon, and without make|ing <HI>proper</HI> applications, give up per&s;ons of ability or power, upon conceptions of their general characters; and then, with the herd, &s;et our faces again&s;t them, as if we knew them to be invincible. How many
<PB N="18" REF="19">
ways are there to overcome per&s;ons, who may not, however, be naturally beneficent! Policy, a regard for outward appearances, o&s;tentation, love of prai&s;e, will &s;ometimes have great influences; and not &s;eldom is the reque&s;ter of a favour him&s;elf in fault, who per|haps &s;hews as much <HI>&s;elf</HI> in the application, as the re|fu&s;er does in the denial.</P>
<P>Let Charlotte know, that I will write to her when <HI>&s;he gives me a &s;ubject.</HI></P>
<P>I will write to Lord and Lady L. by the next mail. To write to either is to write to both.</P>
<P>I have already an&s;wered Emily's favour. I am very glad that her mother, and her mother's hu&s;band, are &s;o wife as to pur&s;ue their own intere&s;ts in their beha|viour to that good girl, and their happine&s;s in their conduct to each other.</P>
<P>My poor cou&s;in Grandi&s;on&mdash;I am concerned for him. I have a very affecting Letter from him. But I &s;ee the proud man in it, valuing him&s;elf on his knowlege of the world, and rather vexed to be over|reached by the common artifices of &s;ome of the wor&s;t people in it, than from right principles. I know not what I can do for him, except I were on the &s;pot. I am grieved that he has not profited by other mens wi&s;dom: I wi&s;h he may by his own experience. I will write to him; yet neither to reproach him, nor to extenuate his folly, tho' I wi&s;h to free him from the con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>I write to my aunt Eleanor, to congratulate and welcome her to London. I hope to find her there on my return from Italy.</P>
<P>The unhappy Sir Hargrave! The &s;till unhappier Merceda! What &s;port have they made of their health, in the prime of their days; and with their reputation! How poor would have been their triumph, had they e&s;caped, by a flight &s;o ignominious, the due reward of their iniquitous contrivances! But to meet with &s;uch a di&s;graceful puni&s;hment, and &s;o narrowly to e&s;cape
<PB N="19" REF="20">
a &s;till <HI>more</HI> di&s;graceful one&mdash;Tell me, Can the poor men look out into open day?</P>
<P>But poor Bagenhall! &s;unk as he is, almo&s;t beneath pity, what can be &s;aid of him?</P>
<P>We &s;ee, Dr. Bartlett, in the behaviour, and &s;ordid acquie&s;cence with in&s;ults, of the&s;e three men, that offen&s;ive &s;pirits cannot be true ones.</P>
<P>If you have any call or inclination to go to London, I am &s;ure you will look in upon the little Oldhams, and their mother.</P>
<P>My compliments to the young officer. I am glad he is plea&s;ed with what has been done for him.</P>
<P>I have Letters from Paris. I am greatly plea&s;ed with what is done, and doing there, in pur&s;uance of my directions, relating to the moiety of 3000<HI>l.</HI> left by the good Mr. Danby, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the di&s;cretion of his executor, either in France or Eng|land. As he gained a great part of his con&s;iderable fortune in France, I think it would have been agreeable to him, to find out there half of the objects of his be|nevolence: Why el&s;e named he France in his Will?</P>
<P>The <HI>intention</HI> of the bequeather, in doubtful ca&s;es, ought always to be con&s;idered. And another ca&s;e has offered, which, I think, as there is a large &s;urplus in my hands, after having done by his relations more than they expected, and full as much as is nece&s;&s;ary, to put them in a flouri&s;hing way, I ought to con&s;ider in that light.</P>
<P>Mr. Danby, at his &s;etting out in life, owed great obligations to a particular family, then in affluent cir|cum&s;tances. This family fell, by unavoidable ac|cidents, into decay. Its de&s;cendents were numerous. Mr. Danby u&s;ed to confer on no le&s;s than &s;ix grand|daughters, and four grand&s;ons, of this family, an annual bounty, which kept them ju&s;t above want. And he had put them in hopes, that he would cau&s;e it to be continued to them, as long as they were un|provided for: The elder girls were in &s;ervices; the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
younger were brought up to be qualified for the &s;ame u&s;eful way of life: The &s;ons were neither idle nor vicious. I cannot but think, that it was his <HI>intention</HI> to continue his bounty to them by his la&s;t will, had he not forgot them when he gave orders for drawing it up; which was not till he thought him&s;elf in a dying way.</P>
<P>Proper enquiries have been made; and this affair is &s;ettled. The numerous family think them&s;elves happy. And the &s;uppo&s;ed intention of my decea&s;ed friend is fully an&s;wered; and no Legatee a &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>You kindly, my dear Dr. Bartlett, regret the di&s;tance we are at from each other. I am the lo&s;er by it, and not you; &s;ince I give you, by pen and ink, almo&s;t as minute an account of my proceedings, as I could do were we conver&s;ing together: Such are your expectations upon, and &s;uch is the obedience of,</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 12-23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now, thank God, &s;ome hopes of our Jeronymo. The opening made below the great wound an&s;wers happily its intention; and that in the &s;houlder is once more in a fine way.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina has been made to under&s;tand, that he is better; and this good news, and the method &s;he is treated with, partly in pur&s;uance of the advice of the Engli&s;h phy&s;icians, leave us not without hopes of her recovery.</P>
<P>The General and his Lady are gone to Naples, in much higher &s;pirits than when they left that city.
<PB N="21" REF="22">
His Lady &s;econding his earne&s;t invitation, I was not able to deny them the promi&s;e of a vi&s;it there.</P>
<P>Every one endeavours to &s;ooth and humour Lady Clementina; and the whole Family is now &s;atisfied, that this was the method which always ought to have been taken with her; and lay to the charge of Lady Sforza and Laurana, perhaps much deeper views than they had at fir&s;t; tho' they might enlarge them after|wards, and certainly did extend them, when the poor Lady was deemed irrecoverable.</P>
<P>Let me account to you, my dear friend, for my &s;ilence of near a month &s;ince the date of my la&s;t.</P>
<P>For a fortnight together, I was every day once with Lady Clementina. She took no &s;mall plea&s;ure in &s;eeing me. She was very various all that time in her ab&s;ences; &s;ometimes &s;he had &s;en&s;ible intervals, but they were not durable. She generally rambled much; and was very incoherent. Sometimes &s;he fell into her &s;ilent fits: But they &s;eldom la&s;ted long when I came. Sometimes &s;he aimed to &s;peak to me in Eng|li&s;h: But her ideas were too much unfixed, and her memory too much &s;hattered, to make her&s;elf under|&s;tood for a &s;entence together, in the tongue &s;he had &s;o lately learned, and for &s;ome time di&s;u&s;ed. Yet, on the whole, her rea&s;on &s;eemed to gather &s;trength. It was a heavy fortnight to me; and the heavier, as I was not very well my&s;elf&mdash;Yet I was loth to forbear my daily vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont, at the fortnight's end, made the family and me a vi&s;it of three days. In that &s;pace, Lady Clementina's ab&s;ences were &s;tronger, but le&s;s frequent than before.</P>
<P>I had, by Letter, been all this time preparing the per&s;ons who had the management of Mr. Jervois's affairs, to adju&s;t, finally, the account relating to his e&s;tate, which remained un&s;ettled; and they let me know, that they were quite ready to put the la&s;t hand to them. It was nece&s;&s;ary for me to attend tho&s;e gen|tlemen
<PB N="22" REF="23">
in per&s;on: And as Mrs. Beaumont could not conveniently &s;tay any longer than the three days, I acquainted the Marchione&s;s, that I &s;hould do my&s;elf the honour of attending her to Florence.</P>
<P>As well Mrs. Beaumont, as the Marchione&s;s, and the Bi&s;hop, thought I &s;hould communicate my inten|tion, and the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing it, to Lady Clemen|tina; le&s;t, on her mi&s;&s;ing me, &s;he &s;hould be impatient, and we &s;hould lo&s;e the ground we had gained.</P>
<P>I laid before the young Lady, in pre&s;ence of her mother and Mrs Beaumont, in a plain and &s;imple manner, my obligation to leave her for a few days, and the rea&s;on for it. To Florence, &s;aid &s;he? Does not Lady Olivia live at Florence?&mdash;She does, u&s;ually, an&s;wered Mrs. Beaumont: But &s;he is abroad on her travels.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, it is not for me to detain you, if you have bu&s;ine&s;s: But what will become of my poor Jeronymo in the mean time?&mdash;But, before I could an&s;wer, What a &s;illy que&s;tion is that? I will be his comforter.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti ju&s;t then entered&mdash;O Father! rambled the poor Lady, you have not prayed with me for a long time. O, Sir, I am an undone creature! I am a lo&s;t &s;oul!&mdash;She fell on her knees, and with tears bemoaned her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She endeavoured, after this, to recollect what &s;he had been talking of before. We make it a rule not to &s;uffer her, if we can help it, to puzzle and perplex her&s;elf, by aiming at recollection? and therefore I told her what was our &s;ubject. She fell into it again with chearfulne&s;s&mdash;Well, Sir, and when may Jero|nymo expect you again?&mdash;In about ten days, I told her. And taking her hint, I added, that I doubted not but &s;he would comfort Signor Jeronymo in my ab&s;ence. She promi&s;ed &s;he would; and wi&s;hed me happy.</P>
<P>I attended Mrs. Beaumont accordingly. I con|cluded,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
to my &s;atisfaction, all that remained unad|ju&s;ted of my Emily's affairs, in two days after my arrival at Florence. I had a happy two days more with Mrs. Beaumont, and the Ladies her friends; and I &s;tole a vi&s;it out of the ten days to the Count of Belvedere, at Parma.</P>
<P>This excur&s;ion was of benefit to my health; and having had a Letter from Mr. Lowther, as I had de|&s;ired at Modena, in my way to Parma, with very favourable news, in relation both to the &s;i&s;ter and bro|ther, I returned to Bologna, and met with a joyful re|ception from the Marquis, his Lady, the Bi&s;hop, and Jeronymo; who all joined to give me a &s;hare in the merit that was principally due to Mr. Lowther, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, with regard to the brother's amendment, and to their own &s;oothing methods of treating the be|loved &s;i&s;ter; who followed &s;trictly the pre&s;criptions of her phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>I was introduced to Lady Clementina by her mo|ther, attended only by Camilla. The young Lady met me at the entrance of her antechamber, with a dig|nity like that which u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h her in her hap|pier days. You are welcome, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he: But you kept not your time. I have &s;et it down; pulling out her pocket-book&mdash;Ten days, madam: I told you ten days. I am exactly to my time&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee that: I cannot be mi&s;taken, &s;miling. But her &s;miles were not quite her own.</P>
<P>She referred me to her book. You have reckoned two days twice over, madam. See here&mdash;</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;I once, Sir, was a better accomptant. Well, but we will not &s;tand upon two days in &s;o many. I have taken great care of Jeronymo in your ab&s;ence. I have attended him &s;everal times; and would have &s;een him oftener; but they told me there was no need.</P>
<P>I thanked her for her care of my friend&mdash;</P>
<P>That's good enough, &s;aid &s;he, to thank me for the care of my&s;elf. Jeronymo is my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Signor Jeronymo, replied I, cannot be dearer to his &s;i&s;ter than he is to me.</P>
<P>You are a good man, returned &s;he; and laid her hand upon my arm; I always &s;aid &s;o. But, Chevalier, I have quite forgot my Engli&s;h. I &s;hall never recover it. What happy times were tho&s;e, when I was in|nocent, and was learning Engli&s;h!</P>
<P>My beloved young Lady, &s;aid Camilla, was always innocent.</P>
<P>No, Camilla!&mdash;No!&mdash;And then &s;he began to ramble&mdash;And taking Camilla under the arm, whi&s;|pering, Let us go together, to that corner of the room, and pray to God to forgive us. You, Camilla, have been wicked as well as I.</P>
<P>She went and kneeled down, and held up her hands in &s;ilence: Then ri&s;ing, &s;he came to her mother, and kneeled to her, her hands lifted up&mdash;Forgive me, for|give your poor child, my mamma!</P>
<P>God ble&s;s my child! Ri&s;e, my Love!&mdash;I do forgive you!&mdash;But do you forgive me, tears trickling down her cheeks, for ever &s;uffering you to go out of my own &s;ight? for delivering you into the management of le&s;s kind, and le&s;s indulgent relations?</P>
<P>And God forgive <HI>them</HI> too, ri&s;ing. Some of them made me crazy, and then upbraided me with being &s;o. God forgive them! I do.</P>
<P>She then came to me; and, to my great &s;urprize, dropt down on one knee. I could not, for a few mo|ments, tell what to do, or what to &s;ay to her. Her hands held up, her fine eyes &s;upplicating&mdash;Pray, Sir, forgive me!</P>
<P>Humour, humour the dear creature, Chevalier, &s;aid her mother, &s;obbing.</P>
<P>Forgive you, madam!&mdash;Forgive you, dear Lady! for what?&mdash;You have not offended! You could not offend.</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed her; and, taking her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips! Now, madam, forgive <HI>me</HI>&mdash;For this free|dom forgive me!</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
O Sir, I have given you, I have given every-body, trouble!&mdash;I am an unhappy creature; and God and you are angry with me&mdash;And you will not &s;ay you forgive me?</P>
<P>Humour her, Chevalier.</P>
<P>I do, I do forgive you, mo&s;t excellent of women.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated a little; then turned round to Camilla, who &s;tood at a di&s;tance, weeping; and running to her, ca&s;t her&s;elf into her arms, hiding her face in her bo|&s;om&mdash;Hide me, hide me, Camilla? What have I done!&mdash;I have kneeled to a man!&mdash;She put her arm under Camilla's, and hurried out of the room with her.</P>
<P>Her mother &s;eeing me in &s;ome con&s;u&s;ion; Rejoice with me, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, yet weeping, that we &s;ee, tho' her rea&s;on is imperfect, &s;uch happy &s;ymp|toms. Our child will, I tru&s;t in God, he once more our own. And you will be the happy in&s;trument of re&s;toring her to us.</P>
<P>The Marquis, and the Bi&s;hop, were informed of what had pa&s;&s;ed. They al&s;o rejoiced, in the&s;e further day-breaks, as I may call them, of their Clementina's rea&s;on, accompanied with that delicacy, that never, in &s;o innocent a mind, can be &s;eparated from it.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, my dear Dr. Bartlett, that I only aim to give you an account of the greater and more vi&s;ible changes that happen in the mind of this un|happy Lady; omitting tho&s;e conver&s;ations between her and her friends, in which her &s;ituation varied but little from tho&s;e before de&s;cribed. By this means, you will be able to trace the &s;teps to that recovery of her rea&s;on, which we pre&s;ume to hope will be the return to our fervent prayers, and humble endeavours.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER IV.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>June <HI>13-24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Conte della Porretta, and the two young Lords Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, came hither ye&s;terday, to rejoice on the hopeful pro&s;pects before us.</P>
<P>I thought I &s;aw a little &s;hine&s;s and re&s;erve &s;it upon the brow of the Marchione&s;s, which I had not ob|&s;erved till the arrival of the Count. A complai&s;ance that was too civil for friend&s;hip; for <HI>our</HI> friend&s;hip. I never permit a cloud to hang for one hour upon the brow of a friend, without examining into the rea&s;on of it, in hopes it may be in my power to di&s;pel it. An abatement in the freedom of one I love, is a charge of unworthine&s;s upon me, that I mu&s;t endeavour to obviate the moment I &s;u&s;pect it. I de&s;ired a private audience of the good Lady.</P>
<P>She favoured me with it at the fir&s;t word. But as &s;oon as I had opened my heart to her, &s;he a&s;ked, If Father Mare&s;cotti, who loved me, &s;he &s;aid, as if I were his own &s;on, might be allowed to be pre&s;ent at our conver&s;ation? I was a little &s;tartled at the que&s;tion; but an&s;wered, By all means.</P>
<P>The Father was &s;ent to, and came. Tender con|cern and re&s;erve were both apparent in his counte|nance. This &s;hewed that he was appri&s;ed of the oc|ca&s;ion of the Marchione&s;s's re&s;erve; and expected to be called upon, or employed in the explanation, had I not demanded it.</P>
<P>I repeated, before him, what I had &s;aid to the Marchione&s;s, of the re&s;erve that I had thought I &s;aw &s;ince ye&s;terday in one of the mo&s;t benign countenances in the world.</P>
<P>Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, if you think that every one of our family, as well tho&s;e of Urbino and Naples, as
<PB N="27" REF="28">
tho&s;e of this place, do not love you as one of their own family, you do not do us ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>She then enumerated and exaggerated their obli|gations to me. I truly told her, that I could not do le&s;s than I had done, and an&s;wer it to my own heart.</P>
<P>Leave <HI>us,</HI> replied &s;he, to judge for our&s;elves on this &s;ubject. And, for God's &s;ake, do not think us ca|pable of ingratitude. We begin with plea&s;ure to &s;ee the poor child after a cour&s;e of &s;ufferings and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that few young creatures have gone thro', reviving to our hopes. She mu&s;t in gratitude, in honour, in ju&s;tice, be yours, if you require her of us, and upon the terms you have formerly propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I think &s;o, &s;aid the Father.</P>
<P>What can I &s;ay? proceeded &s;he: We are all di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I am put upon a ta&s;k that grieves me. Ea&s;e my heart, Chevalier, by &s;paring my &s;peech.</P>
<P>Explain your&s;elf no further, madam: I fully un|der&s;tand you. I will <HI>not</HI> impute ingratitude to any heart in this family. Tell me, Father Mare&s;cotti, if you can allow for <HI>me,</HI> as I could for <HI>you,</HI> were you in my circum&s;tances (and you cannot be better &s;atisfied in your religion, than I am in mine) tell me, by what you <HI>could do,</HI> what I <HI>ought.</HI></P>
<P>There is no an&s;wering a ca&s;e &s;o &s;trongly put, re|plied the Father. But can a fal&s;e religion, an he|re&s;y, per&s;uade an ingenuous mind as &s;trongly as the true?</P>
<P>Dear Father Mare&s;cotti, you know you have &s;aid nothing: It would &s;ound har&s;hly to repeat your own que&s;tion to you; yet that is all I need to do. But let us continue our prayers, that the de&s;irable work may be perfected: That Lady Clementina may be quite recovered. You have &s;een, madam, that I have not offered to give my&s;elf con&s;equence with her. You &s;ee the di&s;tance I have ob&s;erved to her: You &s;ee no|thing in her, not even in her mo&s;t afflicting re&s;veries, that can induce you to think &s;he has marriage in view.
<PB N="28" REF="29">
As I told your Lady&s;hip at fir&s;t, I have but one wi&s;h at pre&s;ent; and that is, her perfect recovery.</P>
<P>What, Father, can we &s;ay? re&s;umed the Marchio|ne&s;s. Advi&s;e us, Chevalier. You know our &s;ituation. But do not, do not impute ingratitude to us. Our child's &s;alvation, in our own opinion, is at &s;take&mdash;If &s;he be yours, &s;he will not be long a Catholic&mdash;Once more, advi&s;e us.</P>
<P>You generou&s;ly, I know, madam, think you &s;peak in time, both for the young Lady's &s;ake and mine. You &s;ay &s;he &s;hall be mine upon the terms I formerly offered, if I in&s;i&s;t upon it. I have told the General, that I will have the con&s;ent of all three brothers, as well as yours, madam, and your good Lord's, or I will not hope for the honour of your alliance: And I have declared to you, that I look upon my&s;elf as bound; upon you all, as free. If you think that the &s;en&s;e of &s;uppo&s;ed obligation, as Lady Clementina ad|vances in her health, may engage her further than you wi&s;h, let me decline my vi&s;its by degrees, in order to leave her as di&s;engaged as po&s;&s;ible in her own mind; and that I may not be thought of con&s;equence to her recovery. In the fir&s;t place, I will make my promi&s;ed vi&s;it to the General. You &s;ee &s;he was not the wor&s;e, but, perhaps, the better, for my ab&s;ence of ten days. I will pa&s;s twenty, if you plea&s;e, at Rome, and at Naples; holding my&s;elf in readine&s;s to return po&s;t, at the fir&s;t call. Let us determine nothing in the interim. Depend upon the honour of a man, who once more a&s;&s;ures you, that he looks upon him&s;elf as bound, and the Lady free; and who will act accordingly by her, and all your family.</P>
<P>They were both &s;ilent, and looked upon each other.</P>
<P>What <HI>&s;ay</HI> you, madam, to this propo&s;al? What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Father Mare&s;cotti? Could I think of a more di&s;intere&s;ted one, I would make it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, you are a wonderful man.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
I have not words, re&s;umed the Lady&mdash;She wept. Hard, hard fate! The man, that of all men&mdash;</P>
<P>There &s;he &s;topt. The Father was pre&s;ent, or, per|haps, &s;he had &s;aid more.</P>
<P>Shall we, &s;aid &s;he, acquaint Jeronymo with this conver&s;ation?</P>
<P>It may di&s;turb him, replied I. You know, madam, his generous attachment to me. I have promi&s;ed the General a vi&s;it. Signor Jeronymo was as much plea&s;ed with the promi&s;e, as with the invitation. The performance will add to his plea&s;ure. He may get more &s;trength: Lady Clementina may be &s;till better: And you will, from events &s;o happy, be able to re&s;olve. Still he plea&s;ed to remember, that I hold my&s;elf bound, your&s;elves to be free.</P>
<P>Yet I thought at the time, with a concern, that, perheps, was too vi&s;ible, When, when &s;hall I meet with the returns, which my proud heart challenges as its due? But then my pride (&s;hall I call it?) came in to my relief&mdash;Great God! I thank thee, thought I, that thou enable&s;t me to do what my con&s;cience, what humanity tells me, is fit and right to be done, without taking my mea&s;ures of right and wrong from any other &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti &s;aw me affected. Tears &s;tood in his eyes. He withdrew, to conceal his emotion. The Marchione&s;s was &s;till more concerned. She called me the mo&s;t generous of men. I took a re&s;pectful leave, and withdrew to Jeronymo.</P>
<P>As I was intending to return to my lodgings, in order to try to calm there my di&s;turbed mind, the Marquis and his Brother, and the Bi&s;hop, &s;ent for me into the Marchione&s;s's drawing-room, where were &s;he and Father Mare&s;cotti; who had acquainted them with what had pa&s;&s;ed between her, him&s;elf, and me.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop aro&s;e, and embraced me&mdash;Dear Gran|di&s;on, &s;aid he, how I admire you!&mdash;Why, why will
<PB N="30" REF="31">
you not let me call you brother?&mdash;Were a prince your competitor, and you would be a Catholic&mdash;</P>
<P>O that you would! &s;aid the Marchione&s;s; her hands and eyes lifted up.</P>
<P>And will you not? Can you not? &s;aid the Count.</P>
<P>That, my Lord, is a que&s;tion kindly put, as it &s;hews your regard for me&mdash;But it is not to be an&s;wered now.</P>
<P>The Marquis took my hand. He applauded the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my behaviour to his family. He approved of my propo&s;al of ab&s;ence; but &s;aid, that I mu&s;t my&s;elf undertake to manage that part, not only with their Clementina, but with Jeronymo; who&s;e grateful heart would otherwi&s;e be unea&s;y, on a &s;ur|mi&s;e, that the motion came not from my&s;elf, but them.</P>
<P>We will not ro&s;olve upon any mea&s;ures, &s;aid he. God continue and improve our pro&s;pects; and the re&s;ult we will leave to his providence.</P>
<P>I went from them directly to Jeronymo; and told him my intention of &s;etting out for Rome and Naples, in di&s;charge of my promi&s;e to the General and his Lady.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me, What would become of Clementina in the mean time? Was there not too great a dan|ger that &s;he would go back again?</P>
<P>I told him I would not go, but with her approba|tion. I pleaded my la&s;t ab&s;ence of ten days, in favour of my intention. Her recovery, &s;aid I, mu&s;t be a work of time. If I am of the con&s;equence your friend|&s;hip for me &s;uppo&s;es, her attention will, probably, be more engaged by &s;hort ab&s;ences, and the expect|ations rai&s;ed by them, than by daily vi&s;its. I remem|ber not, my dear Jeronymo, continued I, a &s;ingle in|&s;tance, that could induce any one to imagine, that your Clementina's regard for the man you favour was a per&s;onal one. Friend&s;hip never lighted up a purer flame in a human heart, than in that of your &s;i&s;ter. Was not the future happine&s;s of the man &s;he e&s;teemed,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
the con&s;tant, I may &s;ay, the <HI>only</HI> object of her cares? In the height of her malady, Did &s;he not declare, that were that great article but probably &s;ecured, &s;he would re&s;ign her life with plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>True, very true: Clementina is an excellent crea|ture: She ever was. And you only can de&s;erve her. O that &s;he could be now worthy of you! But are my father, mother, brother, willing to part with you? Do they not, for Clementina's &s;ake, make Objections?</P>
<P>The la&s;t ab&s;ence fitting &s;o ea&s;y on her mind, they doubt not but frequent ab&s;ences may excite her at|tention.</P>
<P>Well, well, I acquie&s;ce. The General and his Lady will rejoice to &s;ee you. I mu&s;t not be too &s;elfi&s;h. God pre&s;erve you, where-ever you go!&mdash;Only let not the gentle heart of Clementina be wounded by your ab&s;ence. Don't let her mi&s;s you.</P>
<P>To-morrow, replied I, I will con&s;ult her. She &s;hall determine for me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 14-25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING the honour of an invitation to a con|ver&s;ation-vi&s;it, to the Cardinal Legate, and to meet there the Gonfalonier, I went to the palace of Porretta in the morning.</P>
<P>After &s;itting about half an hour with my friend Je|ronymo, I was admitted to the pre&s;ence of Lady Clementina. Her father, mother, and the Bi&s;hop, were with her. Clementina, Chevalier, &s;aid her mo|ther, was enquiring for you. She is de&s;irous to re|cover her Engli&s;h. Are you willing, Sir, to under|take your pupil again?</P>
<P>Ay, Chevalier, &s;aid the young Lady, tho&s;e were
<PB N="32" REF="33">
happy times, and I want to recover them. I want to be as happy as I was then.</P>
<P>You have not been very well, madam: And is it not better to defer our lectures for &s;ome days, till you are quite e&s;tabli&s;hed in your health?</P>
<P>Why, that is the thing. I know I have been very ill: I know that I am not yet quite well; and I <HI>want</HI> to be &s;o: And that is the rea&s;on that I would recover my Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>You will &s;oon recover it, madam, when you begin. But at pre&s;ent, the thought, the memory, it would require you to exert, would perplex you. I am afraid the &s;tudy would rather retard, than forward your re|covery.</P>
<P>Why, now, I did not expect this from you, Sir. My mamma has con&s;ented.</P>
<P>I did, my dear, becau&s;e I would deny you nothing, that your heart was &s;et upon: But the Chevalier has given you &s;uch good rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pend his lectures, that I wi&s;h you would not be earne&s;t in your reque&s;t.</P>
<P>But I can't help it, madam. I want to be happy.</P>
<P>Well, madam, let us begin now. What Engli&s;h book have you at hand?</P>
<P>I don't know. But I will fetch one.</P>
<P>She &s;tept out, Camilla after her, and, poor Lady, forgetting her purpo&s;e, brought down &s;ome of her own work, the fir&s;t thing that came to hand, out of a drawer that &s;he pulled out, in her dre&s;&s;ing-room; in&s;tead of looking into her book-ca&s;e. It is an un|fini&s;hed piece of Noah's ark, and the ri&s;ing deluge; the execution admirable. And, coming to me, I wonder where it has lain all this time. Are you a judge of womens works, Chevalier?</P>
<P>She went to the table&mdash;Come hither, and &s;it down by me. I did. Madam, to her mother; my Lord, to her brother (for the Marquis withdrew, in grief, upon this In&s;tance of her wandering); come, and &s;it down by the Chevalier and me. They did. She
<PB N="33" REF="34">
&s;pread it on the table, and, in an attentive po&s;ture, her elbow on the table, her head on one hand, pointing with the finger of the other&mdash;Now tell me your opi|nion of this work.</P>
<P>I prai&s;ed, as it de&s;erved, the admirable finger of the workwoman. Do you know, that's <HI>mine,</HI> Sir? &s;aid &s;he: But tell me; every-body can prai&s;e; Do you &s;ee no fault?&mdash;I think <HI>that</HI> is one, &s;aid I; and pointed to a di&s;proportion that was pretty obvious&mdash;Why &s;o it is. I never knew you to be a flatterer.</P>
<P>Men, who can find faults more gracefully, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, than others prai&s;e, need not flatter. Why that's true, &s;aid &s;he. She &s;ighed; I was happy when I was about this work. And the drawing was my own too, after&mdash;after&mdash;I forget the painter&mdash;But you think it tolerable&mdash;Do you?</P>
<P>I think it upon the whole very fine. If you could rectify that one fault, it would be a ma&s;ter-piece.</P>
<P>Well, I think I'll try, &s;ince <HI>you</HI> like it. She rolled it up&mdash;Camilla, let it be put on my toilette. I am glad the Chevalier likes it. But, Sir, if I am not at a lo&s;s; for my head is not as it &s;hould be.&mdash;</P>
<P>Poor Lady! She lo&s;t what &s;he was going to &s;ay&mdash;She pau&s;ed as if &s;he would recollect it&mdash;Do you know, at la&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, what is the matter with my head? putting her hand to her &s;orehead&mdash;Such a &s;trange con|fu&s;ion ju&s;t here! And &s;o &s;tupid! She &s;hut her eyes. She laid her head on her mother's &s;houlder; who dropt an involuntary tear on her forehead.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop was affected. Can you, can you, Chevalier, whi&s;pered he, &s;uppo&s;e this dear creature's rea&s;on in your power, and yet with-hold it from her?</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, &s;aid I, how cruel!</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed her head; and, taking her mother's and Camilla's offered &s;alts, &s;melt to them in turn&mdash;I think I am a little better. Were you, Chevalier, ever in &s;uch a &s;trange way?&mdash;I hope not&mdash;God pre&s;erve all people from being as I have been!&mdash;Why now you
<PB N="34" REF="35">
are all affected. Why do you all weep? What have I &s;aid? God forbid, that I &s;hould afflict any-body&mdash;Ah! Chevalier! and laid her hand upon my arm, God will ble&s;s you. I always &s;aid, you were a tender|hearted man. God will pity him, that can pity an|other!&mdash;But, brother, my Lord, I have not been at church of a long time; Have I? How long is it?&mdash;Where is the General? Where is my Uncle?&mdash;Lau|rana! poor Laurana! God forgive her. She is gone to an&s;wer for all her unkindne&s;s!&mdash;And &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry; Did &s;he?</P>
<P>Thus rambled the poor Lady! What, my dear Dr. Bartlett, can be more affecting than the&s;e ab|&s;ences, the&s;e re&s;veries, of a mind once &s;o &s;ound and &s;en&s;ible!</P>
<P>She withdrew at her own motion, with Camilla; and we had no thoughts of communicating to her, at that time, my intentional ab&s;ence. But as I was about taking my leave for the day, Camilla came into Jeronymo's chamber, where I was; and told me, that her young Lady was very &s;edate, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me, if I were not gone.</P>
<P>She led me into Clementina's dre&s;&s;ing-room, where was pre&s;ent her mother only; who &s;aid, &s;he thought I might appri&s;e her daughter of my propo&s;ed Journey to Naples; and &s;he her&s;elf began the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My dear, &s;aid &s;he, the Chevalier has been ac|quainting my Lord and me with an engagement he is under to vi&s;it your brother Giacomo, and his Lady, at Naples.</P>
<P>That is a va&s;t journey, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Not for the Chevalier, my dear. He is u&s;ed to travel.</P>
<P>Only for a vi&s;it!&mdash;Is it not better, Sir, for you to &s;tay here, where every-body loves you?</P>
<P>The General, my dear, and his Lady, love the Chevalier.</P>
<P>May be &s;o. But did you promi&s;e them, Sir?</P>
<P>I did, madam.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
Why then you mu&s;t perform your promi&s;e. But it was not kind in them to engage you.</P>
<P>Why &s;o! my dear? a&s;ked her mother.</P>
<P>Why &s;o! Why what will poor Jeronymo do for his friend?</P>
<P>Jeronymo has confented, my dear. He thinks the journey will do the Chevalier good.</P>
<P>Nay, then&mdash;Will the journey do you good, Sir? If it will, I am &s;ure Jeronymo would not, for the world, detain you.</P>
<P>Are you willing, my dear, that the Chevalier &s;hould go?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;urely, madam, if it will do him good. I would lay down my life to do him good. Can we ever requite him for his goodne&s;s towards us?</P>
<P>Grateful heart! &s;aid her mother; tears in her eyes.</P>
<P>Gratitude, piety, &s;incerity, and every duty of the &s;ocial life, are con&s;titutional virtues in this Lady. No di&s;turbance of mind can weaken, much le&s;s efface them.</P>
<P>Shall you not want to &s;ee him in his ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>Perhaps I may: But what then? If it be for his good, you know&mdash;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, my dear, we could obtain the favour of Mrs. Beaumont's company, while the Chevalier is gone?</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont is all goodne&s;s, &s;aid I. I will en|deavour to engage her. I can go by &s;ea to Naples; and then Florence will be in my way.</P>
<P>Florence! Ay, and then you may &s;ee Olivia too, you know.</P>
<P>Olivia is not in Italy, madam. She is on her travels.</P>
<P>Nay, I am not again&s;t your &s;eeing Olivia, if it will do you good to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>You don't love Olivia, my dear, &s;aid her mother.</P>
<P>Why, not much&mdash;But will you &s;end Mrs. Beaumont to keep me company?</P>
<P>I hope, madam, I may be able to engage her.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
And how long &s;hall you be gone?</P>
<P>If I go by &s;ea, I &s;hall return by the way of Rome: And &s;hall make my ab&s;ence longer or &s;horter, as I &s;hall hear how my Jeronymo does, or as he will or will not di&s;pen&s;e with it.</P>
<P>That is very good of you&mdash;But, but&mdash;Suppo&s;e&mdash;(a &s;weet blu&s;h over&s;pread her face)&mdash;I don't know what I would &s;ay&mdash;But, for Jeronymo's &s;ake, don't &s;tay longer than will do you good. No need of <HI>that,</HI> you know.</P>
<P>Sweet creature! &s;aid the mother.</P>
<P>Did you call <HI>me</HI> &s;o, madam? wrapping her arms about her, and hiding her faintly-blu&s;hing face in her bo&s;om. Then rai&s;ing it up, her arms &s;till folded about her mother: As long as I have my mamma with me, I am happy. Don't let me be &s;ent away from you again, my mamma. I will do every-thing you bid me do. I never was di&s;obedient&mdash;Was I? Fie upon me, if I was!</P>
<P>No, never, never, my deare&s;t Life.</P>
<P>So I hoped. For when I knew nothing, this I u&s;ed to &s;ay over my beads; Gracious Father! let me never forget my duty to thee, and to my parents! I was afraid I <HI>might,</HI> as I remembered nothing&mdash;But that was partly owing to Laurana. Poor Laurana! She has now an&s;wered for it. I would pray her out of her pains, if I could. Yet &s;he <HI>did</HI> torment me.</P>
<P>She has entertained a notion, that Laurana is dead: And as it has removed that terror which &s;he u&s;ed to have, at her very name, they intend not to undeceive her. But, Dr. Bartlett, well, or ill, did you ever know a more excellent creature!</P>
<P>Well, Sir, and &s;o you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go&mdash;She quitted her mo|ther, and with a dignity like that which u&s;ed to di|&s;tingui&s;h her, &s;he turned to me; and gracefully wave|ing one hand, while &s;he held up the other&mdash;God pre|&s;erve you where-ever you go! You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go from friend to friend, were it all the world over. You will
<PB N="37" REF="38">
let Jeronymo hear often from you&mdash;Won't you?&mdash;Pray do. And I will, in every vi&s;it I make to him, enquire when he heard from his friend. Adieu, Sir: Adieu.</P>
<P>I had not intended then to take my leave of her; but, as &s;he anticipated me, I thought it right to do &s;o; and, re&s;pectively bowing on her hand, withdrew, fol|lowed by her eyes and her ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>I went to Jeronymo. The Marchione&s;s came to me there; and was of opinion with me, that I &s;hould take this as a farewel vi&s;it to her Clementina; and to|morrow (&s;ooner by two days than I intended) I pro|po&s;e to &s;et out for Florence, in hopes to engage for them Mrs. Beaumont's company; of which they are all extremely de&s;irous.</P>
<P>I took my leave of the whole family, and Mr. Low|ther; who will write to me at all opportunities: And, perhaps, you will not, for &s;ome weeks, hear further from</P>

<P>I Write on purpo&s;e to acquaint you, that I have had a vi&s;it from Lady Olivia. She dined with me; and is ju&s;t &s;et out for Northampton. We all joined, in the mo&s;t cordial manner, to entreat her to favour us with her company till morning: But &s;he was not to be prevailed upon. Every one of us equally ad|mires, and pities her. Indeed &s;he is a finer woman, than you, Lady G. would allow her to be, in the debate between us in town, on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After dinner, &s;he de&s;ired a quarter of an hour's di&s;|cour&s;e with me alone. We retired into the cedar par|lour.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
She opened, as &s;he &s;aid, her <HI>whole</HI> heart to me. What an hatred has &s;he to the noble Lady Clementi|na! She &s;ometimes frighted me by her threatnings&mdash;Poor unwomanly Lady!</P>
<P>I took the liberty to blame her. I told her, &s;he mu&s;t excu&s;e me; it was ever my way with tho&s;e I re&s;pected.</P>
<P>She would fain have got me to own, that I loved Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. I acknowledged gratitude and e&s;teem&mdash;But as there are no pro&s;pects <HI>(hopes</HI> I had like to have &s;aid), I would go no further. But &s;he was &s;ure it was &s;o. I <HI>did</HI> &s;ay, and I am in earne&s;t, that I never could be &s;atisfied with a divided heart. She cla&s;ped me in her arms upon this, and put her cheek to my forehead.</P>
<P>She told me, that &s;he admired him for his virtue. She knew he had re&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t temptations that ever man was tried with. I hope, poor woman, that none of them were from her!&mdash;For her own &s;ake (not|with&s;tanding what Dr. Bartlett once whi&s;pered, and, good man as he is) I hope &s;o!&mdash;The Chevalier, &s;he &s;aid, was &s;uperior to all attempts that were not ground|ed on honour and con&s;cience. She had heard of wo|men who had &s;pread their &s;nares for him in his early youth: But women, in her country, of &s;light fame, &s;he &s;aid, had no way to come at <HI>him:</HI> And women of virtue were &s;ecure from <HI>his</HI> attempts. Yet would you not have thought, a&s;ked &s;he, that beauty might have marked him for its own? Such an air, &s;uch an addre&s;s, &s;o much per&s;onal bravery, accu&s;tomed to &s;hine in the upper life; all that a woman can value in a man, is the Chevalier Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>She, at la&s;t, declared, that &s;he wi&s;hed him to be mine, rather than any woman's on earth.</P>
<P>I was very frank, very unre&s;erved. She &s;eemed delighted with me; and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt away, profe&s;&s;ing to eve|ry one, as well as to me, that &s;he admired me for my behaviour, my &s;incerity, my prudence (&s;he was

<P>I Am greatly obliged to you, my dear Lady G. for di&s;patching to me, in &s;o extraordinary a way, the fir&s;t Letter of your brother to Dr. Bartlett. I thank God for his &s;afe arrival at the de&s;tined place; and for the faint hopes given in it of his friend's life. The Almighty will do his own work, and in his own way. And that mu&s;t be be&s;t.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me for my opinion of the contents of this Letter, at large&mdash;What can I &s;ay?&mdash;Thus much I mu&s;t &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>I admire, more and more, your brother. I pity the family he is gone to comfort and relieve And I pray for Clementina and Jeronymo; and this as well for your brother's &s;ake as theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">
He generou&s;ly rejoices, that he did not pur&s;ue his own INCLINATIONS&mdash;I am very happy in what he &s;ays of your Harriet. Indeed, my dear, I am. Tho' we may be con&s;cious of not de&s;erving the prai&s;es be|&s;towed upon us, yet are we fond of &s;tanding high in the opinion of tho&s;e we love. Two paragraphs I have got by heart. I need not tell you which they are. But, alas! his greatly favoured friend is not &s;o free, as he hoped &s;he was. It is a plea&s;ure to me, however, becau&s;e it is &s;uch to him, that it is not his fault, but her own, that &s;he is not.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, whom he &s;o ju&s;tly prai&s;es, writes to me; and I an&s;wer&mdash;But to what purpo&s;e? I am afraid, that a very important ob&s;ervation of his comes not in time to do me &s;ervice; &s;ince if my prudence is proportion'd to my trials, I ought to have endeavour'd to exert it &s;ooner.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems there is an in&s;uperable objection again&s;t the poor Lady's going into a Nunnery. I never heard of that before. It &s;eems right to the Marchione&s;s, that the young Lady, who is intituled to a great &s;hare of this world's goods, &s;hould not be dedicated to heaven. This <HI>may</HI> be &s;o in the family eye, for aught I know: But I am per&s;uaded, that if there is any one of it, who would <HI>not</HI> have pleaded this ob&s;tacle to a divine dedication, it would be Clementina her&s;elf. And yet I own, I can allow of their regret, that the cruel Laurana &s;hould be a gainer by Clementina's be|ing lo&s;t, as I may &s;ay, to the world.</P>
<P>Your brother's kind remembrance of Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, is an honour done to me, as well as to them. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> take it &s;o, Lady G. And what he &s;ays of me in the paragraph in which he mentions Emily, adds to the pride he had rai&s;ed in me before.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett is extremely obliging, in not offering to with hold any pa&s;&s;age in your brother's Letters from us. I have let him know, that I think him &s;o; and have begged him not to &s;pare any-thing out of tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="41" REF="42">
to me, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that I may be affected, or made unea&s;y by what your brother &s;hall write to him. This is &s;peaking very plainly, my dear: But it is to Dr. Battlett; and he &s;ignified to us, more than once, that he could not be a &s;tranger to the heart of your Harriet.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Lady G. let me a&s;k you, in my turn, What you think of one pa&s;&s;age in your bro|ther's Letter, of which you have not taken the lea&s;t notice in yours to me? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Charlotte, I hope, is happy, if &s;he be not, it mu&s;t be her own fault."</Q></P>
<P>You have hone&s;tly owned in your la&s;t (yet too rogui&s;hly for a true penitent) that it was evidently &s;o in the debate about being pre&s;ented. <HI>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on u&s;ed</HI> to like the drawing-room well enough. Her bro|ther has owned, in my hearing, as well as in yours, that had he not been &s;o long out of England, and, &s;ince his return to it &s;o &s;eldom in town, he would have made it a part of his duty, to pay his attendance there, at proper times. But <HI>Lady G.</HI> for&s;ooth, di&s;|dained to appear as the property [Reflect but, my dear, how ab&s;urd] of a worthy man, to whom &s;he had vowed love, honour, and obedience.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not remind you thus of pa&s;t flippancies, did not new ones &s;eem to &s;pring up every day.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, my dear Lady G. let it not be carried from England to Italy, that Lord G. is not &s;o happy with a &s;i&s;ter of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, as might be expected; left it be a&s;ked, Whether that &s;i&s;ter, and this brother, had the &s;ame mother. I have written before all that I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay on this &s;ubject. You know your&s;elf to be wrong. It would be im|pertinence to expo&s;tulate further on a duty &s;o known, and acknowleged: No more, therefore, on this head (authorize me to &s;ay) for ever!</P>
<P>As to my health&mdash;I would fain be well. I am more &s;orry, that I am not, for the &s;ake of my friends (who are ince&s;&s;antly grieving for me) than for my own. I
<PB N="42" REF="43">
have not, I <HI>think</HI> I have not, any-thing to reproach my&s;elf with; nor yet any-body to reproach me. To whom have I given cau&s;e of triumph over me, by my ill u&s;age, or in&s;olence to him? I yield to an event to which I ought to &s;ubmit: And to a woman, not <HI>le&s;s,</HI> but <HI>more</HI> worthy than my&s;elf; and who has a prior claim.</P>
<P>I long to hear of the meeting of this noble pair. May it be propitious! May Sir Charles Grandi&s;on have the &s;atisfaction, and the merit with the family, of being the means of re&s;toring to rea&s;on (a greater re|&s;toration than to health) the woman, every faculty of who&s;e &s;oul ought, in that ca&s;e, to be devoted to GOD, and to him! Methinks I have at pre&s;ent but one wi&s;h; it is, that I may live to &s;ee this Lady, if &s;he <HI>is</HI> to be the happy woman. Could I, do you think, Lady G. if I were to have this honour, cordially con|gratulate her as Lady Grandi&s;on? Heaven only knows! But it would be my glory, if I could; for then I &s;hould not &s;cruple to put my&s;elf in a rank with Clementina; and to demand her hand, as that of my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>But, poor Olivia!&mdash;Shall I not pity the unhappy woman, who, I am afraid, is too &s;hort-&s;ighted to look forward to that only con&s;olation which can weak|en the force of worldly di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Reeves, in a joyful Letter, ju&s;t now re|ceived, acquaints me with the birth of the fine boy his wife has pre&s;ented to him: An event that exceed|ingly rejoices us all. He tells me in it, how good you are. Continue to them, my dear Lady G. your affectionate regards. They ever loved you: Even for your very faults, &s;o bewitchingly lively are you. But I have told Mr. Reeves, that his partiality for you &s;hews that he feels not for Lord G. as he would for him&s;elf, were <HI>his</HI> wife a Lady G.</P>
<P>I will write to my other friends. Dear creature! Don't let me &s;ay, that I love Lord G. better than I do Lady G.: Yet, were the aggre&s;&s;or in a quarrel my own &s;i&s;ter, endeared to me by a thou&s;and generous

<SALUTE>My dear Creature!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not, you &s;hall not be ill. What &s;ig|nify your <HI>Heroics,</HI> child, if they only give you placid looks, and make an hypocrite of the &s;incere&s;t girl in England? In other words, if they are only a cover for a de&s;pairing heart? Be better: Be le&s;s affected; or I can tell you, the Doctor and I, and Lady L. &s;hall all think it but &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ght to take you at your fir&s;t word, and &s;end you no more of my bro|ther's Letters. Yet we are all of us as greatly affected by the contents of them, as our dear Harriet can be. I am &s;ure you will allow us to be &s;o, for the poor Lady. But to &s;ubjects le&s;s intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Doctor is with us. Aunt Nell is in love with him. He ordered his matters, and came to town at Lady L's reque&s;t and mine, and Beauchamp's that we might the &s;ooner come at my brother's Letters&mdash;Very obliging!&mdash;Beauchamp wor&s;hips the good man. He would have been with him at Grandi&s;on Hall, but that Sir Harry and Lady Beauchamp knew not how to part with him: And I fancy another flier rea|&s;on with-held him, half unknown to him&s;elf. Love is certainly creeping into his heart. This Emily! a little rogue! has already (yet &s;u&s;pects it not) made a conque&s;t. He de&s;erves her better than any man I know: She him, had &s;he not already a great hole in her heart, thro' which one may run one's head. But does not Beauchamp love the &s;ame per&s;on as much
<PB N="45" REF="46">
as &s;he can do? And does he not know, that the girl is innocent, and the man virtuous, even, as I believe, to cha&s;tity?&mdash;Dear Harriet! Don't let the Ladies around you, nor the Gentlemen neither, hear this grace &s;uppo&s;ed to be my brother's. Nobody about us &s;hall for <HI>me.</HI> I would not have my brother made the je&s;t of one Sex, and the aver&s;ion of the other; and be thought &s;o &s;ingular a young man.</P>
<P>Beauchamp &s;ays nothing to any-body of his regard to Emily: But he lays him&s;elf out in &s;o many un|affected a&s;&s;iduities to her, that one cannot but &s;ee it. She likes his company and his conver&s;ation. But why? becau&s;e he is always launching out in the prai&s;es of his and her beloved friend. He &s;ays, there is not, he believes, &s;uch another innocent and unde&s;igning heart in the world, except one in Northampton&s;hire&mdash;There's for you, Harriet;&mdash;So he prai&s;es not <HI>mine.</HI> That is the wickede&s;t thing of the&s;e <HI>felons</HI> of men: Poverty compels them tho'&mdash;Poverty of genius!&mdash;They cannot prai&s;e one woman, but by robbing the re&s;t. Different, however, from all men, is my bro|ther. I will engage he could find attributes for fifty different women, yet do ju&s;tice to them all: Becau&s;e, tho' he &s;ees every one with favour, he is above flat|tering any.</P>
<P>Well, but, Harriet, I expected Letters &s;ix times as long as the&s;e you &s;ent me. Upon my word, if you are &s;o very heavenly-minded, as you appear to be in the fir&s;t (for the &s;econd is hardly a Letter) I will have you to town, and nun you up with aunt Nell. The Doctor is one of the mo&s;t pious men in England: But &s;he will tire him with praying, and <HI>expounding,</HI> as &s;he calls it. Do you know that the good creature was a Methodi&s;t in York&s;hire? The&s;e <HI>overdoers,</HI> my dear, are wicked wretches. What do they, but make religion look unlovely, and put <HI>un|derdoers</HI> out of heart? My brother is <HI>The man.</HI> You know I mu&s;t always bring in my brother, tho' I am
<PB N="46" REF="47">
a little out of humour with him, at pre&s;ent: And am I not ju&s;tified by the many? Since it is always the way of tho&s;e who intend not to mend, to &s;et their hearts again&s;t their correctors&mdash;My brother profe&s;&s;es not the one half of what he practi&s;es. He u&s;es the fa&s;hion, without abu&s;ing it, or him&s;elf, by following it. Some &s;uch words in a &s;acred book rumble in my mad head! but I know I have not them right.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ay what you will, Harriet, to be long upon terms with <HI>this</HI> man&mdash;Lord G. I mean. He was once half in the right, to be &s;ure; but you &s;hould not have reproached me with <HI>that.</HI> The bride was &s;hewn, the jewels were &s;hewn, the whole family paraded it together; and Emily wrote you all how-and-about it. But never fear for your poor friend. The hone&s;t man will put <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in the wrong next, to &s;ave her credit. He has been long carele&s;s, and now he is, at times, <HI>imperious,</HI> as well as carele&s;s. Very true! Nay it was but ye&s;terday, that he attempted to hum a tune of contempt, upon my warbling an Italian air. An opera couple, we! Is it not charming to &s;ing <HI>at</HI> (I cannot &s;ay <HI>to)</HI> each other, when we have a mind to be &s;piteful? But he has a mi&s;erable voice. He cannot &s;ing &s;o fine a &s;ong as I can. He &s;hould not attempt it. Be&s;ides, I can play to my &s;ong; that cannot be. Such a foe to melody, that he hates the very fight of my harp&s;ichord. He flies out of the room, if I but move towards it.</P>
<P>He has every-body of his &s;ide; Lord and Lady L., Emily, nay, Dr. Bartlett and aunt Nell. This &s;ets him up. No &s;uch thing as managing one's own hu&s;band, when &s;o many wi&s;e heads join together, to uphold him. <HI>Ut</HI>-terly ruined for a hu&s;band, is Lord G.; I once bad &s;ome hopes of him. But now, every good-natur'd je&s;t is turned into earne&s;t by the&s;e me|diators and mediatrices.</P>
<P>A few days ago, in a fond fit, I would have &s;troked his cheek; tho' he was not in a very good humour
<PB N="47" REF="48">
neither&mdash;<HI>So, then! So, then!</HI> &s;aid I, as I had &s;een Beauchamp do an hour before by his prancing nag; and it was con&s;trued as a contempt, and his bri&s;tles got up upon it. Ble&s;s me, thought I, this man is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of a favour as Beauchamp's hor&s;e; and yet I have known the time, when he has thought it an honour to be admitted to pre&s;s the &s;ame fair hand with his lips, on one knee.</P>
<P>Hark! He is now, at this very in&s;tant, complain|ing to aunt Nell. Little do they think, that I am in her clo&s;et. She hears all he has to &s;ay, with greedy ears&mdash;The&s;e antiquated &s;ouls are happy, when they can find rea&s;ons from the di&s;agreement of hone&s;t people in matrimony, to make a virtue of neco&s;&s;ity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thank the Lord, I am not married! if the&s;e be the fruits of matrimony!'</Q>&mdash;Ah!

If it &s;hould, and Lady Gertrude and aunt Nell (&s;piteful old &s;ouls!) &s;hould find their perpetual cu|rio&s;ity an&s;wered as they wi&s;h, I will have my own will in every-thing.</P>
<P>And how came I, you will wonder, in aunt Nell's clo&s;et? I will tell you. She had got my pen and ink: And I went to fetch it my&s;elf: The &s;cribbling fit was &s;trong upon me! &s;o I &s;at down in her clo&s;et to write: And they both came into her chamber together, to have their own talk&mdash;Hark, I &s;ay!&mdash;They are really talking of me&mdash;Complaining!&mdash;Abominable!&mdash;This wicked aunt of mine <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I tell you, nephew, that you are too ready to make up with her."</Q>&mdash;Could you have believed this of one's own aunt? No wonder that he is &s;o refractory at times. But, hu&s;h!&mdash;Why don't he &s;peak louder? He can't be in earne&s;t hurt, if he does not rai&s;e his voice. Creeping &s;oul, and whiner!&mdash;I can't hear a word he &s;ays. I have enough again&s;t <HI>her!</HI>&mdash;But I want &s;omething again&s;t <HI>him</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="48" REF="49">
Duce take them both! I can't hear more than the &s;ound of her broken-toothed voice, mumbling; and his plaintive hum-drum, whimpering. I will go out in full maje&s;ty. I will lighten upon them with airs imperial. How the poor &s;ouls will &s;tart at my ap|pearance! How will their con&s;ciences fly in their faces! The complainer and advi&s;er both detected in the very fact, as I may &s;ay: And yet perhaps you, Harriet, will think them le&s;s blameable than their con|&s;cience-&s;triker.</P>
<P>Hem!&mdash;Three hems in anger!&mdash;And now I bur&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>O HARRIET! what a triumph was mine!</P>
<P>Aunt Neil, who has naturally a good blowzing north-country complexion, turned as pale as a&s;hes. Her chin, no&s;e, and lips, were all in motion. My nim|ble Lord gave a jump, and three leaps, to the other &s;ide of the room. He had not the courage to look directly at me. His face, as &s;harp as a new moon in a fro&s;ty night, and his &s;ides &s;o gaunt&mdash;As if he wanted to &s;hrink into him&s;elf. They could not in their hearts but accu&s;e them&s;elves of all they had &s;aid, as if I had heard every word of it.</P>
<P>While I (what a charming thing is innocence!) half a foot tailer than u&s;ual, &s;talked along between them, ca&s;ting a look of indignation upon aunt Nell; of haughtine&s;s on Lord G. My with-held breath rai&s;ed my complexion, and &s;welled my features! and when I got to the door, I pulled it after me with an air, that I hope made them both tremble.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER X.</HI> Lady <HI>G.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>WELL, my dear&mdash;Aunt Nell and I have made up. I have been pacified by her apologies, and promi&s;es never again to interfere between man and
<PB N="49" REF="50">
wife. As I told the forlorn &s;oul, You maiden Ladies, tho' you have lived a <HI>great while</HI> in the world, can|not know what &s;trange creatures the&s;e hu&s;bands are, and how many cau&s;es (that cannot be mentioned by the poor wife to her friends) a woman may have to be di&s;plea&s;ed with her man, in order to keep the crea|ture in &s;ome little decorum&mdash;Indeed, madam&mdash;There I &s;top&mdash;This excited her prudery; and &s;he made out the re&s;t, and, perhaps, a great deal more than the re&s;t. She looked down, to &s;hew &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, tried for a blu&s;h; and, I verily believe, had &s;he been a young woman, would have &s;ucceeded. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, truly, niece, I believe you are right. The&s;e men are <HI>odious crea|tures!</HI></Q>&mdash;And then &s;he &s;huddered, as if &s;he had &s;aid, Lord defend me from them!&mdash;a prayer, that, being a good creature, &s;he need not doubt will be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>But for Lord G. there lies no forgivene&s;s. To complain of his wife to her aunt! A married man to &s;ubmit matrimonial &s;quabbles (and every hone&s;t pair has <HI>&s;ome)</HI> to others! to an old maid, e&s;pecially! and to authorize her to fit in judgment on his wife's little whim&s;ies, when the good woman wants to make her&s;elf important to him; and thereby endeavour to de&s;troy the wife's &s;ignificance; there's no bearing of that. He had made Lord L. and Lady L. judges over me before. Nay, this infant Emily has taken her &s;eat on the &s;ame bench; and, in her pretty manner, has by be&s;eeching me to be good, &s;uppo&s;ed me bad. And to &s;ome one of them (who knows but to the tell|tale him&s;elf, tho' he denies it?) my brother's hint is owing, on which you &s;o &s;agely expo&s;tulate: My re|putation, therefore, as an obedient wife, with all tho&s;e who&s;e good opinion was worth courting, is gone: And is not this enough to make one carele&s;s?</P>
<P>BLESS me, my dear! This man of errors has com|mitted, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till wor&s;e fault. He regards me not as any-body. The Earl and he have been long
<PB N="50" REF="51">
unea&s;y, it &s;eems, that we live at the expence of my brother, to whom there is no making returns; and a hou&s;e offering in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, he has actually contracted for it, without con&s;ulting me. I mu&s;t own that I cannot in my heart di&s;approve either of the mo|tive, or the hou&s;e, as I have the latter de&s;cribed to me: But his doing it of his own head, is an in&s;olent act of prerogative. Don't you in con&s;cience think &s;o? Does he not, by this &s;tep, make me his chattles, a piece of furniture only, to be removed as any other piece of furniture, or picture, or cabinet, at his plea|&s;ure?</P>
<P>He came to me&mdash;I hope, madam, in a reproaching accent, I have done &s;omething now that will plea&s;e you: Ought his &s;tiff air, and the reflecting word NOW, to have gone unpuni&s;h'd? Ha&s;t thou found out any other old maid, to fit in judgment on the be|haviour of thy wife? But what ha&s;t thou done?&mdash;I was a&s;toni&s;hed when the man told me.</P>
<P>And who is to be thy hou&s;ekeeper? Is this done in, hope I'll follow thee? Or do&s;t thou intend to exclude from thy habitation the poor woman who met thee at church a few weeks ago?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in Lady L. I a&s;ked her, what &s;he thought of this &s;tep?</P>
<P>Had &s;he vindicated him, I never would have re|garded a word &s;he &s;aid between us. But &s;he owned, that &s;he thought I <HI>&s;hould</HI> have been con&s;ulted. And then he began to &s;ee that he had done a wrong thing. I acquainted her with his former &s;ault, unatoned for as it was&mdash;Why, as to <HI>that,</HI> &s;he did not know what to &s;ay; only, that it became <HI>my</HI> character, and good &s;en&s;e, &s;o to behave, as that Lord G. &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain of me to <HI>any</HI>-body. A hard thing, Harriet, to be reflected upon by an own &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>LADY L. prevailed upon me, unknown to Lord G. to go with her to &s;ee this hou&s;e. 'Tis a hand&s;ome

hou&s;e. I have but the one afore&s;aid objection to it&mdash;But let me a&s;k you again: Is not the &s;light he has put upon me, in taking it without con&s;ulting me, an inexcu&s;able thing ?&mdash;I know you will &s;ay it is. But I'll tell you how I think to do&mdash;I will make him give up the contract; and when he has done &s;o, unknown to him, take the &s;ame hou&s;e my&s;elf. This will be returning the compliment. His excu&s;e is, He was &s;ure I &s;hould like the hou&s;e and the terms.

<P>O my dear! What &s;hall I do with this pa&s;&s;ionate man? I could not, you know, forgive him for the two unatoned-for &s;teps which he had taken, with|out <HI>&s;ome</HI> contrition: And do you think he would &s;hew any?&mdash;Not he!&mdash;I &s;aid &s;omething that &s;et him up; &s;omething bordering upon the whim&s;ical&mdash;No matter what. He pranced upon it. I, with my u&s;ual meek|ne&s;s, calmly rebuked him; and then went to my harp&s;ichord: And, what do you think? How &s;hall I tell it; Yet to you I may&mdash;Why then he whi&s;ked his hat from under his arm (he was going out); and &s;ilenced, broke, demoli&s;hed, my poor harp&s;ichord.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized: But in&s;tantly recovering my&s;elf; You are a violent wretch, Lord G. &s;aid I, quite calmly: How could you do &s;o?&mdash;Suppo&s;e (and I took the wicked hat) I &s;hould throw it into the fire? But I gave it to him, and made him a fine courte&s;y. There was command of temper! I thought, at the in&s;tant of Epictetus and his &s;napt leg. Was I not as great a Philo&s;opher?</P>
<P>HE is gone out. Dinner is ready; and no Lord G. Aunt Nell is upon the fret: But &s;he remembers

her late act of delinquency; &s;o is obliged to be &s;ilent. I have her under my thumb.</P>
<P>THE man came in after we had dined. I went to him, as if nothing had been the matter between us. You look vexed, my Lord!&mdash;It <HI>was</HI> a very violent action: It vexed <HI>me</HI> at fir&s;t: But you &s;ee how &s;oon I recovered my temper, I wi&s;h you would learn pa|tience of me. But come, I forgive you; I will not be angry with you, for an evil that a little money will repair. I &s;ee you are vexed.</P>
<P>So I am, madam, at my very &s;oul! But it is not&mdash;</P>

<P>O fie! that's wickedly &s;aid: But I know you <HI>will,</HI> when I a&s;k you.</P>
<P>Aunt Nell &s;at by the window; her eyes half &s;hut; her mouth as firmly clo&s;ed, as if her lips were glewed together.</P>
<P>Madam, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, I &s;hall &s;et out to-morrow for Wind&s;or.</P>

<P>How long, my Lord? mumbled out aunt Nell&mdash;</P>
<P>From Wind&s;or I &s;hall go to Oxford.</P>

<P>How long, my Lord, &s;hall you be ab&s;ent from us?</P>
<P>When I find I can return, and not be the je&s;t of my own wife&mdash;I <HI>may,</HI> perhaps&mdash;There he &s;topt, and looked &s;tately.</P>
<P>Tell my Lord, that he is too &s;erious, madam. Tell him, that hardly any other man but would &s;ee I was at play with him, and would play again.</P>
<P>You hear what my niece &s;ays, my Lord.</P>
<P>I regard nothing &s;he &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">
A&s;k him, madam, who is to be of his party.</P>
<P>Who, my Lord, is to be of your party?</P>
<P>Nobody; turning him&s;elf half round, that he might not be thought to an&s;wer <HI>me,</HI> but <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;k him, madam, whether it be bu&s;ine&s;s or plea|&s;ure, that engages him to take this &s;olitary tour?</P>
<P>She <HI>looked</HI> the que&s;tion to him.</P>
<P>Neither, madam, to her. I left my plea&s;ure &s;ome weeks ago, at St. George's Church. I have never found it &s;ince.</P>
<P>A &s;trange forgetful man! and as ungrateful as for|getful. And I &s;tept to him, and looked in his face, <HI>&s;o</HI> courteou&s;ly! and with &s;uch a <HI>&s;weet</HI> &s;mile!</P>
<P>He &s;ullenly turned from me, and to aunt Nell.</P>
<P>A&s;k my Lord, If he takes this journey, thinking to oblige me?</P>
<P>A&s;k him your own que&s;tions, niece.</P>
<P>My Lord won't an&s;wer me.</P>
<P>He &s;trutted, and bit his lip with vexation.</P>
<P>Come, I'll try once more if you think me worth an&s;wering&mdash;I think, my Lord, if you &s;hall be gone a <HI>month</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> I may take a little trip to Northampton|&s;hire. Emily &s;hall go with me. The girl is very unea&s;y to &s;ee Mi&s;s Byron: And Mi&s;s Byron will re|joice to &s;ee us both, a vi&s;it from us will do her good.</P>
<P>He took it, that I was not de&s;irous of a &s;hort ab&s;ence. And he pouched his mouth, and reared him&s;elf up, and &s;welled; but an&s;wered me not.</P>
<P>See, madam, my Lord is &s;ullen; he won't an&s;wer me. I mu&s;t get <HI>you</HI> to a&s;k my que&s;tions. I think it my duty to a&s;k leave to go. My <HI>Lord</HI> may go where he plea&s;es, without my leave&mdash;Very fit he &s;hould. He is a <HI>man.</HI> I once could have done &s;o; high-ho! but I have vowed obedience and va&s;&s;alage. I will not break my vow. A&s;k him, If I have his con&s;ent for a vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Byron, of a month or two? A&s;k him, ma|dam, If he can make him&s;elf happy in my ab&s;ence? I &s;hould otherwi&s;e be loth to go for &s;o long a time.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
I &s;hould be as welcome, &s;aid he, to Mi&s;s Byron, as <HI>her</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>As her! As &s;he!</HI> you &s;hould &s;ay, I believe, if you won't &s;ay <HI>As you,</HI> madam, and bow to me&mdash;I believe &s;o, my Lord. Mi&s;s Byron would rejoice to &s;ee any of <HI>my</HI> friends. Mi&s;s Byron is very good.</P>
<P>Would to God&mdash;</P>
<P>That &s;omebody were half as good, interrupted I. Somebody under&s;tands you, my Lord, and wi&s;hes &s;o too&mdash;Pray, madam, a&s;k my Lord, If I may go?&mdash;His <HI>new hou&s;e</HI> will be putting in order mean time&mdash;</P>
<P>I will a&s;k none of your que&s;tions for you&mdash;<HI>New hou&s;e,</HI> niece! You harp too much on one &s;tring.</P>
<P>I mean not offence. I have done with that &s;ubject. My Lord, to be &s;ure, has dominion over his bird. He can choo&s;e her cage. She has nothing to do, but &s;it and &s;ing in it&mdash;when her in&s;trument is mended, and in tune&mdash;He has but one fault. He is <HI>too good-natured</HI> to his bird. But would he take <HI>your</HI> advice, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, tho' this may &s;ound to you, Harriet, a little recriminating; yet, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;poke it in a very &s;weet accent: Yet up got aunt Nell, in a pa&s;&s;ion: My Lord too was all alive. I put my&s;elf between her and the door; and throwing my arms about her, You &s;han't go, madam&mdash;Smiling &s;weetly in her glowing face. Upon my honour you &s;han't.</P>
<P>Wicked trifler! She called me, as I led her to a chair. Perver&s;e girl! and two or three other names;&mdash;apropos enough: My character is not difficult to hit; that's the beauty of it.</P>
<P>My Lord withdrew in wrath; and then the old Lady &s;aid, &s;he would now tell me a piece of her mind: And &s;he made me &s;it down by her; and thus &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed me:</P>
<P>Niece, it is my opinion, that you might be, if you <HI>would,</HI> one of the happie&s;t women in the world.</P>
<P>You don't hear <HI>me</HI> complain, madam.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
Well, if Lord G. <HI>did</HI> complain to me; it <HI>was</HI> to <HI>me</HI> And you &s;hould be &s;orry for the occa&s;ion, and not for the complaint.</P>
<P>I may be &s;orry for both, madam.</P>
<P>Well, but Lord G. is one of the be&s;t-natured men in the world&mdash;</P>
<P>The man's well enough. Pa&s;&s;ionate men, they &s;ay, <HI>are</HI> good-natured.</P>
<P>Why won't you be happy, niece?</P>
<P>I will. I am not now <HI>un</HI>-happy.</P>
<P>More &s;hame for you then, that you will not make Lord G. happy.</P>
<P>He is captious. I am playful. That's all.</P>
<P>What do you think your brother would &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>He would blame me, as you do.</P>
<P>Dear creature, be good. Dear creature, make Lord G. happy.</P>
<P>I am like a builder, madam. I am digging for a foun|dation. There is a good deal of rubbi&s;hy humours to re|move; a little &s;wampine&s;s of &s;oil: And I am only re|moving it, and digging deeper, to make my foundation &s;ure.</P>
<P>Take care, take care, niece: You may dig too deep. There may be &s;prings: You may open, and never be able to &s;top them, till they have &s;apped your founda|tion. Take care, niece.</P>
<P>Thank you, madam, for your caution. Pity you had not been a builder your&s;elf!</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a fellow-labourer as Lord G. offered, I &s;hould not have refu&s;ed a partner&s;hip with him, I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Fairly an&s;wered, aunt Nell! thought I, I was plea&s;|ed with her.</P>
<P>Don't you think Lord G. loves you dearly?</P>
<P>As to <HI>dearly,</HI> I can't &s;ay: But I believe he loves me as well as mo&s;t hu&s;bands love their wives.</P>
<P>Are you not ungrateful then?</P>
<P>No. I am only at play with him. I don't hate him.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
Hate him! Dreadful if you did! But he thinks you de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>That is one of the rubbi&s;hy notions I want to re|move. He would have it that I did, when he could have helped him&s;elf. But he injures me now, if he thinks &s;o. I can't &s;ay I have a very profound reverence for him. <HI>He</HI> and my <HI>brother</HI> &s;hould not have been al|lied. But had I de&s;pi&s;ed him in my heart, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf a very bad creature for going to church with him.</P>
<P>That's well &s;aid. I love you now. Your brother, is, indeed, enough to put all other men down with one. But may I tell Lord G. that you love him?</P>
<P>No, madam.</P>
<P>No! I am &s;orry for that.</P>
<P>Let him find it out. But he ought to know &s;o much of human nature, and of my &s;incerity, as to gather from my behaviour to him, that had I either hated or de&s;pi&s;ed him, I would not have been his; and it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to be &s;o playful with him; to be &s;o dome&s;tic, and he &s;o much at home with me. Am I fond of &s;eeking occa&s;ions to carry my&s;elf from him? What delights, what diver&s;ions, what public entertainments, do I hunt after?&mdash;None. Is not he, are not all my friends, &s;ure of finding me at home, whenever they vi&s;it me?</P>
<P>So far, &s;o good, &s;aid aunt Eleanor.</P>
<P>I will open my heart to you, madam. You are my father's &s;i&s;ter. You have a right to my &s;incerity. But you mu&s;t keep my &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Proceed, my dear.</P>
<P>I know my own heart, madam, If I thought I could not tru&s;t it (and I wi&s;h Lord G. had a good opinion of it) I would not dance thus, as you &s;up|po&s;e, on the edge of danger.</P>
<P>Good creature!&mdash;I &s;hall call you good creature by-and-by. Let me call Lord G. to us.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent. I contradicted her not. She rang.
<PB N="57" REF="58">
She bid the &s;ervant tell Lord G. that &s;he de&s;ired his company. Lord G. was pranced out. She regretted (I was not glad) that he was.</P>
<P>I will tell you what, my dear, &s;aid &s;he. I have heard it &s;ugge&s;ted, by a friend of yours, that you would much rather have had Mr. Beauchamp&mdash;</P>
<P>Not a word more of &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion, madam. I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, were I capable of treating Lord G. meanly, or contemptibly, with a thought of prefer|ence to any man breathing, now I am his. I have a great opinion of Mr. Beauchamp. He de&s;erves it. But I never had the &s;hadow of a wi&s;h, that I had been his. I never &s;hould have &s;poken of my brother's ex|cellencies, as out&s;hining tho&s;e of Lord G. had he not been my <HI>brother,</HI> and therefore could not be more to me; and had they not been &s;o con&s;picuous, that no other man could be di&s;graced by giving place to him. No, madam, let me a&s;&s;ure you, once for all, that I am &s;o far from de&s;pi&s;ing my Lord G. that, were any misfortune to befal him, I &s;hould be a mi&s;erable woman.</P>
<P>She embraced me. Why then&mdash;</P>
<P>I know your inference, madam. It is a ju&s;t one. I am afraid I think as <HI>well</HI> of my own under&s;tanding as I do of Lord G's. I love to je&s;t, to play, to make him look about him. I di&s;like not even his petulance. You &s;ee I bear all the flings and throws, and peevi&s;h|ne&s;s, which he returns to my &s;aucine&s;s. I think I <HI>ought.</HI> His complaints of me to you, to Lord and Lady L. which bring upon me their and your grave lecturings, and even anger, I can forgive him for; and this I &s;hew by making tho&s;e complaints matter of plea&s;antry rather than re&s;entment. I know he intended well, in taking the hou&s;e, tho' he con&s;ulted me not fir&s;t. It was &s;urely wrong in him; yet I am not mortally offended with him for it. His violence to my poor harp&s;ichord &s;tartled me; but I recollected my&s;elf: and had he buffetted <HI>me</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>that,</HI> as I was afraid he would,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
I &s;hould have thought I <HI>ought</HI> to have borne it, whether I <HI>could</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> and to have returned him his hat with a courte&s;y. Believe me, madam, I am not a bad, I am only a whim&s;ical creature. I tried my brother once. I &s;et him up. I was afraid of <HI>him,</HI> indeed. But I tried him again. Then he called it con&s;titution, and laughed at me, and run me out of breath in my own way. So I let <HI>him</HI> alone. Lord L. Lady L. had it in turn. Lord G. has a little more than his turn perhaps: And why? becau&s;e he is for ever fitting the cap to his head; and becau&s;e I don't love him le&s;s than tho&s;e I am le&s;s free with. Come, madam, let me demand your kind thoughts. I <HI>will</HI> de&s;erve them. Contradiction and oppo&s;ition, mediators and mediatrices, have carried my playfulne&s;s further than it would otherwi&s;e have gone. But henceforth <HI>your</HI> precepts, my <HI>brother</HI>'s, and Mi&s;s <HI>Byron</HI>'s, &s;hall not want their weight with me, whether I may &s;hew it or not at this In&s;tant. My reign, I am afraid, will be but &s;hort. Let the man bear with me a little now-and-then. I am not ab&s;olutely ungene|rous. If he can but &s;hew his love by his forbearance, I will endeavour to reward his forbearance with my love.</P>
<P>She embraced me, and &s;aid, That now &s;he attributed to the gaiety of my &s;pirits, and not to perver&s;ene&s;s, my <HI>till</HI>-now unaccountable behaviour.

<P>PRepare, Harriet, to hear &s;trange and wonderful things.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;ent up his compliments, and de&s;ired to know, if he might attend me. I was in my dre&s;&s;ing|room. He was not always &s;o polite. I wi&s;h, thought I, &s;ince di&s;plea&s;ure produces re&s;pect, that familiarity does not &s;poil this man. But I'll try him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee my Lord, was the an&s;wer I returned.</P>
<P>Up he came, one leg dragg'd after the other. Not alert, as he u&s;ed to be on admi&s;&s;ion to his Charlotte. The la&s;t eight &s;tairs his &s;teps founded, I, go, up, with, an, hea-vy, heart. He entered; bowed: Were the words yours, You &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me, madam?</P>
<P>They <HI>were,</HI> my Lord.</P>
<P>Would to God you &s;aid truth!</P>
<P>I did. I <HI>am</HI> glad to &s;ee you. I wanted to talk with you&mdash;About this Northampton&s;hire vi&s;it?</P>
<P>Are you in earne&s;t, madam, to make that vi&s;it?</P>
<P>I am. Mi&s;s Byron is not well. Emily pines to &s;ee her as much as I. You have no objection?</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Do you &s;et out, to-morrow, Sir, for Wind&s;or and Oxford?</P>
<P>He &s;ighed. I think &s;o, madam.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
Shall you vi&s;it Lord W.?</P>
<P>I &s;hall.</P>
<P>And complain to him of me, my Lord?&mdash;He &s;hook his grave head, as if there were wi&s;dom in it&mdash;Be quiet, Harriet&mdash;Not good all at once&mdash;That would not be to hold it.</P>
<P>No, madam, I have done complaining to <HI>any</HI>-body. You will one day &s;ee you have not acted generou&s;ly by the man who loves you as his own &s;oul.</P>
<P>This, and his eyes gli&s;tening, moved me&mdash;Have we not been <HI>both</HI> wrong, my Lord?</P>
<P>Perhaps we have, madam: But here is the differ|ence&mdash;I have been wrong, with a <HI>right intention:</HI> You have been wrong, and <HI>&s;tudied</HI> to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Prettily &s;aid&mdash;Repeat it, my Lord&mdash;How was it? And I took his hand, and looked very graciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I cannot bear the&s;e airs of contempt.</P>
<P>If you call them &s;o, you are wrong, my Lord, tho', perhaps, <HI>intending</HI> to be <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>He did not &s;ee how good I was di&s;po&s;ed to be. As I &s;aid, a change all at once would have been unna|tural.</P>
<P>Very well, madam! and turned from me with an air half-grieved, half-angry.</P>
<P>Only an&s;wer me, my Lord; are you willing I &s;hould go to Northampton&s;hire?</P>
<P>If you choo&s;e to go, I have no objection. Mi&s;s Byron is an angel.</P>
<P>Now, don't be perver&s;e, Lord G. Don't prai&s;e Mi&s;s Byron at the expence of &s;omebody el&s;e.</P>

<P>He held it there with both his, and ki&s;&s;ed it. I was not offended. But do you actually &s;et out for Wind&s;or and Oxford to-morrow, my Lord?</P>
<P>Not, madam, if you have any commands for me.</P>
<P>Why, now, that's well &s;aid. Has your Lord&s;hip any-thing to propo&s;e to me?</P>

<P>You <HI>could</HI> not! How can you &s;ay &s;o, my Lord? You would do me both honour and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What would I give, that you mean what you &s;ay!</P>
<P>I <HI>do</HI> mean it, my Lord&mdash;My hand upon it&mdash;I held out my hand for his. He &s;natched it; and I thought would have devoured it.</P>
<P>We will take the coach, my Lord, that I may have your company all the way.</P>
<P>You equally a&s;toni&s;h and delight me, madam! Is it po&s;&s;ible that you are&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, don't, in policy, make it &s;uch a wonder, that I am di&s;po&s;ed to be what I <HI>ought</HI> to be.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be too, too, too happy! &s;obbed the man.</P>
<P>No, no! I'll take care of that. Married folks, brought up differently, of different humours, incli|nations, and &s;o-forth, never can be too happy. Now I intend to put up all our little quarrels in my work-bag [You know I am a worker: Not quite &s;o bad, at wor&s;t, as &s;ome modern wives]: There they &s;hall lie, till we get to Mi&s;s Byron's&mdash;I revere the character of Mrs. Shirley, my Harriet's grandmother: Mrs. Selby you have &s;een: Harriet, and you, and I, and the two &s;ages I have named, will get together in &s;ome happy hour. Then I will open my work-bag, and take out our quarrels one by one, and lay them on the table before us; and we will be determined by their judgments.</P>
<P>My dear Lady G. if you think there is any-thing ami&s;s in your behaviour to me, or in mine to you, let us &s;pread the faults on your toilette now; and we &s;hall go down to Northampton&s;hire all love and harmony, and delight tho&s;e excellent&mdash;</P>
<P>Always pre&s;cribing, my Lord!&mdash;O the&s;e men!&mdash;Why will you not let me have my own way?&mdash;Have not all the&s;e good folks heard of our folly? And &s;hall
<PB N="62" REF="63">
they not be witne&s;&s;es of our wi&s;dom? If they are not at the agreement, they will wonder how it came about.&mdash;I tell you, Sir, that they &s;hall have an opportunity to laugh at us both; at <HI>me,</HI> for my flippancy; at <HI>you,</HI> for your petulance. I will be &s;orry, you &s;hall be a|&s;hamed, that quarrels &s;o ea&s;ily made up, and where the heart of either is not bad, &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t a quarter of an hour, and be perpetually renewing. I <HI>will</HI> have my own way, I tell you.</P>
<P>Don't make me look like a fool, madam, before &s;uch Ladies as tho&s;e, if we do vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have my je&s;t, my Lord. You know (for have you not try'd it?) that I can have patience&mdash;Let me &s;ee&mdash;Is that the hat that you pulled off with an air &s;o lately?&mdash;Pi&s;h!

<P>O madam! nothing, nothing more! And he ki&s;&s;ed my hand on one knee, with a rapture, that he never could have known, had we always been quiet, ea&s;y, and drow&s;y, like &s;ome married folks, whom the world calls happy.</P>
<P>But then the man came out with his gew-gaw japan|china ta&s;te. Why, why is it the privilege of people of quality now, to be educated in &s;uch a way, that their time can hardly ever be worthily filled up; and as if it were a di&s;grace to be either manly or u&s;eful? He began to talk of equipage, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e; but I cut him &s;hort, by telling him, that I mu&s;t have my whole way on this occa&s;ion&mdash;Our vi&s;it is to be a pri|vate one, &s;aid I. We will have only the coach. Jen|ny &s;hall attend on Emily and me. No other female &s;ervant. Two men: We will have no more. I will not have &s;o much as your French-horn. We go to the land of harmony. Kings &s;ometimes travel incog. We will ape kings, when they put off royalty.
<PB N="63" REF="64">
Will not this thought gratify your pride?&mdash;You, my Lord, have &s;ome foibles to be cured of, as well as I.&mdash;We &s;hall be wonderfully amended, both of us, by this excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Poor man! His heart was as light as a <HI>feather.</HI> Upon my word, my dear, I begin to think, that if my Lord and ma&s;ter had been a wi&s;e man, I &s;hould not have known what to do with him. Yet I will not forgive any one but my&s;elf, who finds him out to be <HI>other</HI>-wi&s;e.</P>
<P>He told me, in raptures of joy, that I &s;hould direct every-thing as I plea&s;ed. God grant that I might not change my mind, as to the vi&s;it! He hoped I was in earne&s;t; and looked now-and-then at me, as if he que&s;tioned it.</P>
<P>But what do you think the man did? He retired; came back pre&s;ently; called me his deare&s;t life; and &s;aid, That it was po&s;&s;ible I might want to have an opportunity given me to make &s;ome pre&s;ents, or to furni&s;h my&s;elf with trinkets of one nature or other, again&s;t I &s;et out; and he &s;hould be very &s;orry, if, by his inattention, I were obliged to a&s;k him for the means to &s;hew the natural liberality of my &s;pirit in the way I thought be&s;t to exert it; and then he begged me to accept of that note, putting into my hand a bank note of 500 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;tept to my clo&s;et, and <HI>as</HI> in&s;tantly returned. This, my Lord, &s;aid I, is a mo&s;t cruel reflexion upon me. It looks as if I were to be bribed to do my duty&mdash;There, my Lord! Take back your pre&s;ent. I will en|deavour to be good without it&mdash;And as a proof that I <HI>will,</HI> you mu&s;t not only receive back your favour (tho' I look upon it as &s;uch, and from my heart thank you for it) but take, as your right, this note which Lord W. pre&s;ented to me on the day you received me as yours.</P>
<P>He held back both hands, gratefully reluctant.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t, you <HI>&s;hall,</HI> take <HI>both</HI> notes, my Lord. I
<PB N="64" REF="65">
only wanted a fit opportunity to put Lord W's note into your hands before. It was owing to my flippant folly, and not to your want of affection, that I had not that opportunity &s;ooner. Bear with me now-and-then, if I &s;hould be &s;illy again. Complain of me only to my&s;elf. My heart, I re-a&s;&s;ure you, is yours, and yours <HI>only.</HI> I was not willing that you &s;hould owe to any other per&s;on's interpo&s;ition, my declarations of affection and regard to you, not even to Mi&s;s Byron (tho' I talked of my work-bag) whom I love as my own &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The worthy man was in ec&s;tacies. He could not expre&s;s in words the joy of his heart. He kneeled, and wrapt his arms about my wai&s;t; and &s;obbed his reque&s;t to me to forgive his petulance, and the offences he had ever given me, by any acts of pa&s;&s;ion, or words of anger.</P>
<P>You have not offended me, my Lord. Forgive my pa&s;t follies, and my future failures. When you were mo&s;t angry, I wondered at your patience. Had I been you, I &s;hould not have borne what you bore with me.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, madam, take back both notes. We can have but one intere&s;t. You will make me ea&s;ier, when I know that you have power in your hands to gratify every wi&s;h of your heart.</P>
<P>You <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> you <HI>&s;hall,</HI> my Lord, take the&s;e notes. I will apply to you whenever I have occa&s;ion, and re|ceive your favours, as &s;uch. I wi&s;h not to be inde|pendent of you. I have a hand&s;ome &s;um by me, the moiety of the money that was my mother's, which my brother divided between my &s;i&s;ter and me, when he fir&s;t came over. Is not the &s;ettlement made upon me more than my brother a&s;ked, or thought I <HI>&s;hould</HI> ex|pect? Did he not oppo&s;e &s;o large an annuity for pin|money, as your father, Lady Gertrude, and you, would have me accept of, becau&s;e he thought that &s;uch a large allowance might make a wife independent of her hu&s;band, and put it out of his power, with di&s;|cretion,

to oblige her? My brother, in an in&s;tance glorious to him, &s;aid, That he would not be a richer man than he ought to be. In &s;uch in&s;tances I will be his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Aunt Nell joined us. My Lord, in tran&s;ports, told her what had pa&s;&s;ed. The good old &s;oul took the merit of the reformation to her&s;elf. She wept over us. She rejoiced to hear of our intended journey to Northampton&s;hire. My Lord propo&s;ed to have the hou&s;e he had taken fitted up to my liking, while we were away. At his de&s;ire I promi&s;ed to &s;ee it in his company, and give my opinion of his de&s;igned alter|ations. But as I know he has judgment in nick-knack|atories, and even as much as I wi&s;h him in what is called <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> I intend to compliment him with leaving all to him; and re&s;olve to be &s;atisfied with whatever he does.</P>
<P>And now is the good man <HI>&s;o</HI> bu&s;y, <HI>&s;o</HI> plea&s;ed, <HI>&s;o</HI> im|portant! Ble&s;s me, my dear! Who would rob the hone&s;t man of any part of his merit; or even divide it with him?</P>

<P>WHAT can I do for my cou&s;in? Why would he oppre&s;s me with &s;o circum&s;tantial an ac|count of the heavy evil that has befallen him, and not point out a way by which I could comfort or relieve him? Don't be afraid of what you call the &s;everity of my virtue. I &s;hould be ready to que&s;tion the rectitude of my own heart, if, on examination, I had not rea&s;on to hope, that charity is the principal of tho&s;e virtues which you attribute to me. You recriminate enough upon your&s;elf. In what way I can extricate or a&s;&s;i&s;t you, is now my only que&s;tion?</P>
<P>You a&s;k my advice, in relation to the payment of the debts which the world call debts of honour; and for which you have a&s;ked, and are granted three months time. Have you not, Sir, &s;trengthened your engage|ment by your reque&s;t? And have not they intitled them|&s;elves to the performance, by their compliance with it?
<PB N="67" REF="68">
The obligation which ra&s;hne&s;s, and, perhaps, &s;urprize, laid you under, your deliberation has confirmed.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, that your new creditors are men of the town, &s;harpers, and game&s;ters. But, my cou&s;in, how came you among &s;uch? They came not to you. I &s;ay not this to upbraid you: But I mu&s;t not have you deceive your&s;elf. Who but a man's &s;elf is to &s;uffer by his ra&s;hne&s;s or incon&s;ideration? They are reputed to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fortunes, however they came by them, which would have enabled them to an&s;wer the &s;takes they played for, had they been the lo&s;ers: And would you not have exacted payment from them, had you been the winner? Did you at the <HI>time</HI> &s;u&s;pect loaded dice, or foul play? You are not, Sir, a novice in the ways of the town. If you had good <HI>proof</HI> of what, from the ill &s;ucce&s;s you &s;eem only to <HI>&s;u&s;pect,</HI> I &s;hould not account the debts incurred <HI>debts of ho|nour;</HI> and &s;hould hardly &s;cruple, had I not indirectly promi&s;ed payment, by a&s;king time for it, or had they refu&s;ed to give it, to call in to my aid the laws of my country; and the rather, as the appeal to tho&s;e laws would be a &s;ecurity to me, again&s;t ever again being &s;een in &s;uch company.</P>
<P>Adver&s;ity is the trial of principle: Without it, a man hardly knows whether he is an hone&s;t man. Two things my cou&s;in, in his pre&s;ent difficulties, mu&s;t guard again&s;t; the one, that he do not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be prevailed upon, in hopes to retrieve his lo&s;&s;es, to <HI>frequent</HI> the tables by which he has &s;uffered; and &s;o become one of the very men he has &s;o much rea&s;on to wi&s;h he had avoided [Who would not rather be the &s;ufferer than the defrauder? What mu&s;t be the na|ture of that man, who, having him&s;elf been ruined, will endeavour to draw in other innocent men to their ruin?].</P>
<P>The other that he do not permit prior and wor|thier creditors (creditors from valuable con&s;iderations) to &s;uffer by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which he has involved him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
It is a hard deci&s;ion: But were I my cou&s;in, I would dive&s;t my&s;elf of my whole e&s;tate (were it ne|ce&s;&s;ary) for the &s;atisfaction of my creditors; and leave it to their genero&s;ity, to allow me what pittance they plea&s;ed for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and within that pittance would I live, not only for ju&s;tice &s;ake, but (were my dif|ficulties owing to my own incon&s;ideration) as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for not being &s;atisfied with my own ampler fortune, and for putting to hazard a certainty, in hopes of obtaining a &s;hare in the property of others. Ex|cu&s;e me, my dear Everard; I mean not particular reflexion; but only to give you my notion of ge|neral ju&s;tice in ca&s;es of this nature.</P>
<P>Acquit your&s;elf worthily of the&s;e difficulties. I con&s;ider you as my brother: And you &s;hall be wel|come to take with me a brother's part of my e&s;tate, till you can be re&s;tored to a competency.</P>
<P>But with regard to the woman whom the infamous Lord B. would impo&s;e upon you as a wife, that is an impo&s;ition to which you mu&s;t not &s;ubmit. Had &s;he been the poore&s;t hone&s;t girl in Britain, and you had &s;educed her, by promi&s;es of marriage, I mu&s;t have made it the condition of our continued friend&s;hip, that you had married her. But a kept-woman!&mdash;Let not HER, Let not the <HI>bad man,</HI> have &s;uch a triumph. I know his character well: I know his dependance on the &s;kill of his arm. And I know his litigious &s;pirit, and the u&s;e he is capable of making of his privilege. But regard not the&s;e: Let me advi&s;e you, Sir, after you have &s;ecured to your creditors the payment of their ju&s;t debts, to come over to me: The &s;ooner the better. By this means you will be out of the way of being di&s;turbed by the menaces of this Lord, and the machinations of this woman. We will return to|gether. I will make your ca&s;e my own. Both the courage, and the quality, of the man who can be un|ju&s;t, are to be de&s;pi&s;ed. Is not Lord B. an unju&s;t man in <HI>every</HI> article of his dealings with men? Do not

<P>Mrs. Selby, Lucy, Nancy, Harriet, met us at Stony-Stratford, e&s;corted by uncle Selby, and his kin&s;man James.</P>
<P>My Lord and I were Dear, Love, and Life, all the journey. I was the <HI>&s;weete&s;t</HI>-tempered creature!&mdash;Joy|ful people are not always wi&s;e ones. When the heart is open, &s;illy things will be &s;aid; any-thing, in &s;hort, that comes uppermo&s;t. I kindly allowed for my Lord's joy, on twenty occa&s;ions. I &s;miled when he &s;miled, laughed-out when he laughed out, did not talk to any-body el&s;e when he directed his di&s;cour&s;e to me; &s;o that the hone&s;t man crowed all the way. It is a charming thing, thought I &s;everal times, to be on a foot of good under&s;tanding with each other; for now I can call him <HI>hone&s;t man,</HI> or any names, that lately would have made him prance and caper; and he takes every-thing kindly: Nay, two or three times he called me <HI>hone&s;t woman;</HI> but laughed and looked round him at the time, as if he were con&s;cious that he had made a <HI>bold,</HI> as well as <HI>witty</HI> retort.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, Lady L. that I intend to give him &s;igns when he exceeds, and other &s;igns when he is right and clever; and I will accept of &s;igns from him, that he may not be affronted. I am confident that we &s;hall be in time an amazing happy couple.</P>

Emily was rejoiced to &s;ee her equally beloved and revered Mi&s;s Byron. Mi&s;s Byron embraced Emily with the affection of a &s;i&s;ter.

<P>James Selby almo&s;t wept for love over Emily's hand; while Emily looked as &s;leek and as &s;hy as a bird new-caught, for fear of being thought to give him encouragement, after what you may remember pa&s;&s;ed between them at Dun&s;table.</P>
<P>Aunt Selby, Lucy, Nancy, were all rapture to &s;ee us: We to &s;ee them. We were <HI>mother</HI> and <HI>&s;i&s;ters</HI> the moment we were &s;eated. Uncle Selby began to crack his jokes upon me in the fir&s;t half-hour. I &s;pared him not: And Lord G. will fare the better for him; &s;ince I mu&s;t have &s;omebody to play the rogue with. Dr. Bartlett was the revered of every heart. By the way, I am in high credit with that good man, for my behaviour to my Lord.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron received him with open arms, and even, as her father, with an offered cheek: And the mode&s;t man was &s;o much affected by her filial regard for him, that I was obliged, for our own &s;akes, to whi&s;per her, to rein-in her joy to &s;ee him, that we might have the plea&s;ure of hearing him talk.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Selby-hou&s;e, our joy was re|newed, as if we had not &s;een each other at Stratford.</P>
<P>O, I &s;hould have told you, that in our journey from Stratford hither, aunt Selby, Harriet, Emily, and I, were in one coach: And I had, as we went on, a great deal of good in&s;truction in&s;inuated to me, by way of felicitation, on my being &s;o very kind and obliging to Lord G. And, as if I had been a child (corrected for being untoward) they endeavoured to coax me into a per&s;everance in what they called my duty. Aunt
<PB N="71" REF="72">
Selby, on this occa&s;ion, performed the maternal part with &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, and her prai&s;e and her cau|tions were &s;o delicately in&s;inuated, that I began to think, it was almo&s;t as pretty to be good as to be &s;aucy.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I really believe Lord G. will have rea&s;on to rejoice, as long as he lives, that he was ruled by his wife, in changing his Wind&s;or and Oxford jour|ney for this of Northampton&s;hire. So <HI>right</HI> a thing is it for men to be governable; and, perhaps, you'll add, for women to keep good company.</P>
<P>Lord L. thinks you, my &s;age &s;i&s;ter, &s;o good already, that you need not be better, or I would wi&s;h him to &s;end you down to Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Well may Harriet revere her grandmother. That venerable woman is good in every &s;en&s;e of the word. She is pious, charitable, benevolent, affectionate, con|de&s;cending to the very foibles of youth; chearful, wi&s;e, patient under the infirmities of age, having out|lived all her wi&s;hes but one; which is, to &s;ee her Harriet happily married: And then, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he hopes to be &s;oon relea&s;ed. Never could &s;he be &s;o much admired in her blooming youth, tho' &s;he was then, it &s;eems, de&s;ervedly celebrated, both for her mind and per&s;on, as &s;he is now in her declining age.</P>
<P>You have &s;een and admire Mrs Selby. She ri&s;es upon me every hour. It gives one's heart joy, Lady L. to look forward, beyond the age of youth and flutter, when we &s;ee by the&s;e Ladies, that women in their ad|vanced years may, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the &s;tile of Sir Rowland Meredith, be good for &s;omething; or &s;till better, that the matronly time of female life, is by far the mo&s;t e&s;timable of all the &s;tages of it; if they make good wives, good mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and good mothers: And, let me &s;ay, good <HI>aunts;</HI> were it but to keep in countenance aunt Gertrude and aunt Nell; who, good &s;ouls! will now hardly ever be <HI>mothers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
Lucy is an excellent young creature. Nancy, when Lucy is not pre&s;ent, is <HI>as</HI> excellent. Her cou&s;ins Kitty and Patty Holles are agreeable young women.</P>
<P>James Selby is a good &s;ort of blundering well-mean|ing great boy; who, when he has lived a <HI>few years longer,</HI> may make much &s;uch a good &s;ort of man, as my Lord G. There's for you, my once catechiz|ing &s;i&s;ter! Pray be as ready to prai&s;e, as you u&s;ed to be to blame me. I find duty and love growing fa&s;t upon me. I &s;hall get into a cu&s;tom of bringing in Lord G. on every occa&s;ion that will do him credit: And then I &s;hall be like Lady Betty Clem&s;on; who is &s;o perpetually dinning the ears of her gue&s;ts with her dome&s;tic &s;uperlatives, that we are apt to &s;u&s;pect the truth of all &s;he &s;ays.</P>
<P>But Harriet, our dear Harriet is not at all well. She vi&s;ibly falls away; and her fine complexion fades. Mr. Deane was here a week ago; and Lucy tells me, was &s;o much &s;tartled at the alteration in her lovely countenance, that he broke from her, and &s;hed tears to Lucy. This good girl and Nancy lament to each other the too-vi&s;ible change: But when they are with the re&s;t of the family, they all &s;eem afraid to take no|tice of it to one another. She her&s;elf takes generous pains to be lively, chearful, and unapprehen&s;ive, for fear of giving concern to her grandmother and aunt; who will &s;ometimes &s;it and contemplate the alteration, &s;igh, and, now-and-then, drop a &s;ilent tear, which, however, they endeavour to &s;mile off, to avoid no|tice. I have already ob&s;erved, that as the&s;e good Ladies &s;it in her company, they watch in &s;ilent love every turn of her mild and patient eye, every change of her charming countenance; for they too well know to what to impute the inward malady, which has ap|proached the be&s;t of hearts; and they know that the cure cannot be within the art of the phy&s;ician. They, as <HI>we</HI> do, admire her voice, and her playing. They a&s;k her for a &s;ong, for a le&s;&s;on on her harp&s;ichord.
<PB N="73" REF="74">
She plays, &s;he &s;ings, at the very fir&s;t word. In no one act of chearfulne&s;s does &s;he refu&s;e to join. Her grand|mother and her aunt Selby frequently give a private ball. The old Lady delights to &s;ee young people chearful and happy. She is always pre&s;ent and di|rects the diver&s;ion; for &s;he has a fine ta&s;te. We are often to have the&s;e Balls, for our entertainment. Mi&s;s Byron, her cou&s;ins &s;ay, knowing the delight her grand|mother takes in the&s;e amu&s;ements, for the &s;ake of the young people, to whom &s;he con&s;iders it as a health|ful exerci&s;e, as well as diver&s;ion, is one of the alerte&s;t in them. She excu&s;es not her&s;elf, nor encourages that &s;upeinne&s;s that creeps on, and invades a heart ill at ea&s;e. Yet every-one &s;ees, that &s;olitude and retire|ment are her choice; tho' &s;he is very careful to have it &s;uppo&s;ed otherwi&s;e; and, on the fir&s;t &s;ummons, ha&s;tens into company, and joins in the conver&s;ation. O &s;he is a lovely, and beloved young creature! I think verily, that tho' &s;he was the admiration of every-body, when &s;he was with us, yet &s;he is, if po&s;&s;ible, more amiable at home, and among her own relations. Her uncle Selby raillies her &s;ometimes. But re&s;pect, as well as love, are vi&s;ible in his countenance, when he does: In her returns &s;weetne&s;s and reverence are mingled. She never forgets that the raillier is her uncle; yet her delicacy is not more apparent, than that &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of fine talents in that way; but often re&s;trains them, becau&s;e &s;he has far more &s;uperior ones to value her&s;elf upon. And is not this the ca&s;e with my brother al&s;o?&mdash;Not &s;o, I am afraid, with your Charlotte.</P>
<P>All her friends, however, rejoice in our vi&s;it to them, for her &s;ake. They compliment me on my lively turn; and hope for a happy effect on Mi&s;s Byron from it.</P>
<P>I cannot accu&s;e her of re&s;erve to me. She owns her Love for our brother as frankly as &s;he u&s;ed to do, after we had torn the &s;ecret from her bo&s;om at Colne|brooke.
<PB N="74" REF="75">
She acknowleges to me, that &s;he glories in it, and will not try to conquer it; becau&s;e &s;he is &s;ure the trial will be to no purpo&s;e; an excu&s;e, by the way, that if the conque&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary, would bet|ter become the mouth of your Charlotte than that of our Harriet: And &s;o I have told her.</P>
<P>She prays for the re&s;toration of Lady Clementina, and recovery of Signor Jeronymo. She loves to talk of the whole Italian family; and yet &s;eems fully a&s;&s;ured that Clementina will be the happy woman. But, &s;urely, Harriet mu&s;t be our &s;i&s;ter. She values her&s;elf upon my brother's &s;o &s;olemnly reque&s;ting and claiming her friend&s;hip. True Friend&s;hip, &s;he but this morning argued with me, being di&s;intere&s;ted, and more intel|lectual than per&s;onal, is nobler than Love. Love, &s;he &s;aid, does not always ripen into Friend&s;hip, as is too frequently &s;een in wedlock.</P>
<P>But does not the dear creature refine too much when &s;he argues thus? A calm and ea&s;y kind of e&s;teem, is all I have to judge from in <HI>my</HI> matrimony. I know not what Love is. At the very highe&s;t, and when I was mo&s;t a fool, my motive was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> convenience (in order to be freed from the appre|hended tyranny of a father); and that never carried me beyond liking. But you, Lady L. were an adept in the pa&s;&s;ion. Pray tell me, if there <HI>be</HI> a difference between Love and Friend&s;hip, which is the noble&s;t? Upon my oppo&s;ing you and Lord L. (&s;o truly one mind) to her argument, &s;he &s;aid, That yours is Love mel|lowed into Friend&s;hip, upon full proof of the merit of each: But, that there <HI>was</HI> a time, that the flame was Love only, founded in <HI>hope</HI> of the merit; and the <HI>proof</HI> might have been wanting; as it often is, when the hope has been as &s;trong, and &s;eemingly as well founded as in your court&s;hip.</P>
<P>Harriet, po&s;&s;ibly, may argue from her own &s;itua|tion, in order to make her heart ea&s;y; and my bro|ther is &s;o <HI>unque&s;tionably</HI> worthy, that Love and Friend|&s;hip
<PB N="75" REF="76">
my be one thing, in the bo&s;om of a woman ad|miring him; &s;ince he will not enter into any obliga|tion, that he cannot, that he <HI>will</HI> not, religiou&s;ly per|form. And if this refinement will make her heart ea&s;ier, and enable her to allow his Love to be placed el&s;ewhere, becau&s;e of a prior claim, and of circum|&s;tances that call for generous compa&s;&s;ion, while &s;he can content her&s;elf with the offered Friend&s;hip, I think we ought to indulge her in her delicate notions.</P>
<P>Selby-hou&s;e is a large, convenient, well-furni&s;h'd ha|bitation. To-morrow we are to make a vi&s;it, with Lucy and Nancy, to their branch of the Selby Family. James is gone before. Tho&s;e two girls are orphans: But their grandmother, by their mother's &s;ide (a good old Lady, mother-in-law to Mr. Selby) lives with them, or, rather, they with her; and loves them.</P>
<P>On our return, we are to have our fir&s;t private Ball, at Shirley-manor; a fine old &s;eat, which, al|ready, the benevolent owner calls her Harriet's; with an e&s;tate of about 500 <HI>l.</HI> a year round it.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Lady L.&mdash;My Lord and you, I hope, will own me now. Yet are you not &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;uddenne&s;s of my reformation? Shall I tell you how it came about? To own the truth, I began to find the man could be &s;tout. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Charlotte, thought I, what are you about? You mean not to continue for ever your playful folly.

My brother will be reflected upon for his &s;olicitude to carry me to church with a man, whom I &s;hall make the world think I de&s;pi&s;e. Harriet will renounce me. My wit will be thought folly.

I will get home as fa&s;t as I can; and rejoice every one, who now only wonder what is become of me."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, Lady L, were &s;ome of my rea&s;onings. Make your advantage of them again&s;t me, if you can. You &s;ee that your grave wi&s;dom had &s;ome weight with my light folly.

<P>Let me conclude this &s;ubject, half one way, half t'other&mdash;that is to &s;ay, half &s;erious, half rogui&s;h: If my Lord would but be cured of his ta&s;te for trifles and nick-knacks, I &s;hould, po&s;&s;ibly, be induced to con|&s;ider him as a man of better under&s;tanding than I once thought him: But who can forbear, &s;ometimes, to think &s;lightly of a man, who, by effeminacies, and a Shell and China ta&s;te, undervalues him&s;elf? I hope I &s;hall cure him of the&s;e foibles; and, if I <HI>can,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider him as a work of my own hands, and be proud of him, in compliment to my&s;elf.</P>

<P>THREE weeks have now pa&s;t &s;ince the date of my la&s;t Letter to my paternal friend. Nor has it, in the main, been a di&s;agreeable &s;pace of time; &s;ince within it I have had the plea&s;ure of hearing from you and other of my friends in England; from tho&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="79">
at Paris; and good news from Bologna, where-ever I moved, as well from the Bi&s;hop and Father Mare|&s;cotti as from Mr. Lowther.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop particularly tells me, that they a&s;cribe to the amendment of the brother, the hopes they now have of the &s;i&s;ter's recovery.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed near a fortnight of this time at Naples and Portici. The General, and his Lady, who is one of the be&s;t of women, made it equally their &s;tudy to ob|lige and amu&s;e me.</P>
<P>The General, on my fir&s;t arrival at Naples, entered into talk with me, on my expectations with regard to his &s;i&s;ter. I an&s;wered him, as I had done his mother; and he was &s;atisfied with what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>When we parted, he embraced me as his brother and friend; and apologized for the animo&s;ity he once had to me. If it plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore his &s;i&s;ter, no more from him, he &s;aid, &s;hould her mind be endan|gered: But <HI>her</HI> choice &s;hould determine <HI>him.</HI> His Lady declared her e&s;teem for me, without re&s;erve; and &s;aid, That, next to the recovery of Clementina and Jeronymo, her wi&s;h was, to be intitled to call me Brother.</P>
<P>What, my dear Dr. Bartlett, is, at la&s;t, to be my de&s;tiny! The greate&s;t oppo&s;er of the alliance once in view, is overcome: But the Bi&s;hop, you will ob|&s;erve, by what I have told you, a&s;cribes to another cau&s;e the merit which the General gives me; with a view, po&s;&s;ibly, to abate my expectation. Be the event as it may, I will go on in the cour&s;e I am in, and leave to Providence the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont returned from Bologna but ye|&s;terday.</P>
<P>She confirms the favourable account I had before received of the great alteration for the better that there is in the health both of brother and &s;i&s;ter; and, becau&s;e of that, in the whole family. Mr. Lowther, &s;he &s;ays, is as highly, as de&s;ervedly, care&s;&s;ed by every
<PB N="79" REF="80">
one. Jeronymo is able to &s;it up two hours in a day. He has tried his pen, and finds it will be again in his power to give his friends plea&s;ure with it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont tells me, that Clementina gene|rally twice a day vi&s;its her beloved Jeronymo. She has taken once more to her needleworks, and often fits and works in her brother's room. This amu&s;es her, and delights him.</P>
<P>She conver&s;es generally without much rambling; and &s;eems to be very &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of her misfortune, when &s;he begins to talk incoherently: For at &s;uch times &s;he immediately &s;tops; not &s;eldom &s;heds a tear; and either withdraws to her own clo&s;et, or is &s;ilent.</P>
<P>She &s;everal times directed her di&s;cour&s;e to Mr. Low|ther, when &s;he met him in her brother's chamber. She ob&s;erved great delicacy when &s;he &s;poke of me to him; and dwelt not on the &s;ubject: But was very inqui&s;itive about England, and the cu&s;toms and man|ners of the people; particularly of the women.</P>
<P>Every-body has made it a rule (Jeronymo among the re&s;t, and to which al&s;o Camilla &s;trictly conforms) never to lead her to talk of me. She, however, a&s;ks often after me; and numbers the days of my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>At one time, &s;eeking Mrs. Beaumont in her dre&s;&s;ing|room, &s;he thus acco&s;ted her: I come, madam, to a&s;k you, Why every-body forbears to mention the Chevalier Grandi&s;on; and when <HI>I</HI> do, talks of &s;ome|body or &s;omething el&s;e? Camilla is as perver&s;e in this way as any body: Nay, Jeronymo (I have tried him &s;everal times) does the very &s;ame. Can Jeronymo be ungrateful? Can Jeronymo be indifferent to his friend, who had done &s;o much for him? I hope I am not looked upon as a &s;illy, or as a forward creature, that am not to be tru&s;ted with hearing the name of the man mentioned, for whom I profe&s;s an high e&s;teem and gratitude. Tell me, madam, have I, at any time, in my unhappy hours, behaved or &s;poken aught unwor|thy of my character, of my family, of the mode&s;ty
<PB N="80" REF="81">
of woman?&mdash;If I <HI>have,</HI> my heart renounces the guilt; I mu&s;t, indeed, have been unhappy; I could not be Clementina della Porretta.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont &s;et her heart at ea&s;e on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, it &s;hall be &s;een, I hope &s;o, that true mode&s;ty, and high gratitude, may properly have a place together in <HI>this</HI> heart, putting her hand to her bo&s;om. Let me but own, that I e&s;teem him; for I really do; and I hope my &s;incerity &s;hall never mi&s;lead or betray me into indecorum: And now, madam, let us talk of him for one quarter of an hour, and no more. Here is my watch; it is an Engli&s;h watch; nobody knows that I bought it for that very rea&s;on. Don't <HI>you</HI> tell. She then, &s;u&s;pecting her head, dropt a tear; and withdrew in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont, my dear friend, knows the true &s;tate of my heart; and &s;he pities me. She wi&s;hes that the Lady's rea&s;on may be e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;he is afraid it &s;hould be ri&s;qued by oppo&s;ition: But there is a man whom &s;he wi&s;hes to be Clementina's. There is a woman&mdash;But&mdash;do thou, Providence, direct us both! All that thou ordere&s;t mu&s;t be be&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont thinks Lady Clementina is at times too &s;olemn: And is the more apprehen&s;ive when &s;he is &s;o, as there is a greatne&s;s in her &s;olemnity, which &s;he is afraid will be too much for her. She has often her &s;ilent fits, in which &s;he is regardle&s;s of what any|body but her mother &s;ays to her.</P>
<P>As &s;he grows better, the fervor of her devotion, which in her highe&s;t delirium never went quite off, increa&s;es. Nor do they di&s;courage, but indulge her in it, becau&s;e in her, it &s;eems, by the chearfulne&s;s with which her ardent zeal is attended, to be owing to true piety, which they ju&s;tly ob&s;erve never makes a good mind &s;our, moro&s;e, or melancholy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont &s;ays, That for two days before &s;he came away, &s;he had &s;hewn, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, that &s;he began to expect my return&mdash;She brok &s;ilence in

<P>IT was late la&s;t night before I arrived at this place. I &s;ent my compliments to the family. In the morn|ing I went to their palace, and was immediately con|ducted to the chamber of Signor Jeronymo. He was di&s;po&s;ing him&s;elf to ri&s;e, that he might receive me up, in order to rejoice me on his ability to do &s;o. I &s;at down by him, and received the overflowings of his grateful heart. Every-body, he told me, was amended both in health and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Camilla came in &s;oon after, congratulating me on my arrival in the name of her young Lady. She let me know, that in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour &s;he would be ready to receive my vi&s;it.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid the good woman, miracles! miracles!&mdash;We are all joy and hope!</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83">
At going out, &s;he whi&s;pered as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed (I was then at the window) My young Lady is dre&s;&s;ing in colours, to receive you. She will no more <HI>appear</HI> to you, &s;he &s;ays, in black&mdash;Now, Sir, will you &s;oon reap the reward of all your goodne&s;s; for the General has &s;ignified to my Lord his entire acquie&s;cence with his &s;i&s;ter's choice, and their determination.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop came in: Chevalier, &s;aid he, you are welcome, thrice welcome, to Bologna. You have &s;ubdued us all. Clementina commands her own de|&s;tiny. The man whom &s;he choo&s;es to call hers, be he who he will, will have a trea&s;ure in her, in every &s;en&s;e of the word. The Marquis, the Count, Father Mare&s;cotti, all &s;everally made me the highe&s;t compli|ments. The Count particularly taking my hand, &s;aid, From <HI>us,</HI> Chevalier, nothing will be wanting to make <HI>you</HI> happy: From <HI>you,</HI> there can be but one thing wanting to make <HI>us</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s entering, &s;aved me any other re|turn, than by bowing to each. Before I could &s;peak to her, Welcome, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he. But you are not come before you were wi&s;hed for. You will find, we have kept a more exact account of the days of your ab&s;ence, than we did before. I hope her joy to &s;ee you will not be too much for her. Clementina ever had a grateful heart.</P>
<P>The Chevalier's prudence, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, may be confided in. He knows how to moderate his own joy on his fir&s;t addre&s;s to her, on &s;eeing her &s;o greatly amended. And then Lady Clementina's na|tural delicacy will not not have an <HI>example</HI> to carry her joy above her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, madam, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, &s;miling, will, at this rate, be <HI>too</HI> &s;ecure. We leave him not room for <HI>profe&s;&s;ions.</HI> But he cannot be ungenerous.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the kind Jeronymo, &s;peaks by <HI>action:</HI> It is his way. His head, his heart, his lips, his hands, are governed by one motion, and
<PB N="83" REF="84">
directed by one &s;pring. When he leaves no room for doubt, profe&s;&s;ions would depreciate his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He then a&s;cribed an extraordinary merit to me, on my leaving my native country and friends, to attend them in per&s;on.</P>
<P>We may, perhaps, my reverend friend, be allowed to repeat the commendations given us by grateful and benevolent friends, when we cannot <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> &s;o well do ju&s;tice to the generous warmth of &s;uch exalted &s;pirits. The noble Jeronymo, I am confident, were he in my place, and I in his, would put a more mo|derate value on the like &s;ervices, done by him&s;elf. What is friend&s;hip, if, on the like calls, and ble&s;&s;ed with power, it is not ready to exert it&s;elf in action;</P>
<P>Grandi&s;on, replied the Bi&s;hop, were he <HI>one of us,</HI> might expect canonization. In a better religion, we have but few young men of quality and fortune &s;o good as he; tho' I think none &s;o bad, as many of the pre|tended REformed, who travel, as if to copy our vices, and not to imitate our virtues.</P>
<P>I was overwhelmed with gratitude, on a reception &s;o very generous and unre&s;erved. Camilla came in &s;ea&s;onably with a me&s;&s;age from the young Lady, in|viting my attendance on her in her dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s withdrew ju&s;t before. I followed Camilla. She told me, as we went, that &s;he thought her not quite &s;o &s;edate as &s;he had been for &s;ome days pa&s;t; which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed owing to her hurrying in dre&s;&s;ing, and to her expectation of me.</P>
<P>The mother and daughter were together. They were talking, when I entered&mdash;Dear fanciful girl! I heard the mother &s;ay, di&s;po&s;ing otherwi&s;e &s;ome flowers that &s;he had in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Clementina, when her mind was &s;ound, u&s;ed to be all unaffected elegance. I never &s;aw but one wo|man who equalled her in that re&s;pect. Mi&s;s Byron &s;eems con&s;cious, that &s;he may tru&s;t to her native charms; yet betrays no pride in her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="84" REF="85">
Who ever &s;poke of her jewels, that beheld her face? For mingled dignity, and freedom of air and manner, the&s;e two Ladies excel among&s;t women.</P>
<P>Clementina appeared exceedingly lovely. But her fancifulne&s;s in the di&s;po&s;ition of her ornaments, and the unu&s;ual lu&s;tre of her eyes, which every one was wont to admire for their <HI>&s;erene</HI> brightne&s;s, &s;hewed an imagination more di&s;ordered than I hoped to &s;ee; and gave me pain at my entrance.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, my Love! (&s;aid the Marchione&s;s, turning round to me) Clementina, receive your friend.</P>
<P>She &s;tood up, dignity and &s;weetne&s;s in her air. I approached her: She refu&s;ed not her hand. The Ge|neral, madam, and his Lady, &s;alute you by me.</P>
<P>They received you, I am &s;ure, as the friend of our family. But tell me, Sir, &s;miling, have you not ex|ceeded your promi&s;ed time?</P>
<P>Two or three days only.</P>
<P><HI>Only,</HI> Sir!&mdash;Well, I upbraid you not. No won|der that a man &s;o greatly valued, cannot always keep his time.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated, looked at her mother, at me, and on the floor, vi&s;ibly at a lo&s;s. Then, as &s;en&s;ible of her wandering, turned a&s;ide her head, and took out her handkerchief.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont, madam, &s;aid I, to divert her chagrin, &s;ends you her compliments.</P>
<P>Were you at Florence?&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont, &s;aid you!&mdash;Were you at Florence! Then running to her mo|ther, &s;he threw her arms about her neck, hiding her face in her bo&s;om&mdash;O, madam, conceal me! conceal me from my&s;elf. I am not well.</P>
<P>Be comforted, my be&s;t Love, wrapping her mater|nal arms about her, and ki&s;&s;ing her forehead; you will be better pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I made a motion to withdraw. The Marchione&s;s, by her head, approving, I went into the next apart|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
She &s;oon enquired for me, and, on notice from Ca|milla, I returned.</P>
<P>She &s;at with her head leaning on her mother's &s;houl|der. She rai&s;ed it&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. I cannot be well, I &s;ee&mdash;But no matter! I am better, and I am wor&s;e, than I was: <HI>Wor&s;e</HI> becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible of my calamity.</P>
<P>Her eyes had then lo&s;t all that lu&s;tre which had &s;hewn a too rai&s;ed imagination: But they were as much in the other extreme, overclouded with mi&s;ti|ne&s;s, dimne&s;s, vapours; &s;wimming in tears.</P>
<P>I took her hand: Be not di&s;hearten'd, madam. You will be &s;oon well. The&s;e are u&s;ual turns of the ma|lady you &s;eem to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, when it is changing to perfect health.</P>
<P>God grant it!&mdash;O Chevalier! what trouble have I given my friends!&mdash;my mamma here!&mdash;You, Sir!&mdash;Every-body! O that naughty Laurana! But for <HI>her!</HI>&mdash;But tell me&mdash;Is &s;he dead?&mdash;Poor cruel creature! Is &s;he no more?</P>
<P>Would you have her to be no more, my Love? &s;aid her mother.</P>
<P>O no! no! I would have had her to live, and to repent. Was &s;he not the companion of my childhood? She loved me once. I <HI>always</HI> loved her. Say, Che|valier, is &s;he living?</P>
<P>I looked at the Marchione&s;s, as a&s;king, if I &s;hould tell her &s;he was; and receiving her approving nod, She is living, madam, an&s;wered I&mdash;and I hope will repent&mdash;</P>
<P>Is &s;he, is &s;he indeed, my mamma? interrupted &s;he.</P>
<P>She is, my dear.</P>
<P>Thank God! ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, cla&s;ping her hands, and &s;tanding more erect than u&s;ual; then have I a triumph to come! &s;aid the noble creature! Ex|cu&s;e my pride! I will &s;hew her that I can forgive her!&mdash;But I will talk of her when I am better. You &s;ay,
<PB N="86" REF="87">
Sir, I <HI>&s;hall</HI> be better! You &s;ay that my malady is changing&mdash;What comfort you give me!</P>
<P>Then dropping down again&s;t her mother's chair, on her knees, her eyes and hands lifted up, Great and good God Almighty, heal, heal, I be&s;eech thee, my wounded mind, that I may be enabled to re&s;tore to the mo&s;t indulgent of parents, the happine&s;s I have robbed them of. Join your prayers with mine, Sir! You are a good man&mdash;But you, madam, are a Catholic, The Chevalier is not&mdash;Do <HI>you</HI> pray for me. I &s;hall be re&s;tored to <HI>your</HI> prayers. And may I <HI>be</HI> re&s;tored, as I &s;hall never more do any-thing, wilfully, to offend or di&s;turb your tender-heart.</P>
<P>God re&s;tore my child! &s;obbed the indulgent pa|rent, rai&s;ing her.</P>
<P>Camilla had not withdrawn. She &s;tood weeping in a corner of the room. Camilla, &s;aid the young Lady, advancing towards her, lend me your arm. I will return to you again, Sir&mdash;Don't go&mdash;Excu&s;e me, madam, for a few moments. I find, putting her hand to her forehead, I am not quite well&mdash;I will return pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s and I were extremely affected by her great behaviour: But tho' we were grieved for the pain her &s;en&s;ibility gave her, yet we could not but con&s;ole and congratulate our&s;elves upon it, as afford|ing hopes of her perfect recovery.</P>
<P>She returned &s;oon, attended by Camilla; who having been &s;oothing her, appealed to me, whether I did not think &s;he would &s;oon be quite well.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, That I had no que&s;tion of it.</P>
<P>Look you there, now, my dear Lady.</P>
<P>I thought you &s;aid &s;o, Chevalier; but I was not &s;ure. God grant it! My affliction is great, my mamma. I mu&s;t have been a wicked creature&mdash;Pray for me.</P>
<P>Her mother comforted her, prai&s;ed her, and rai&s;ed her dejected heart. And then Clementina looking down, a blu&s;h over&s;preading her face, and &s;tanding
<PB N="87" REF="88">
motionle&s;s, as if con&s;idering of &s;omething&mdash;What is in my child's thoughts? &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, taking her hand. What is my Love thinking of?</P>
<P>Why, madam, in a low, but audible voice, I &s;hould be glad to talk with the Chevalier alone, methinks. He is a good man. But if you think I ought not, I will not de&s;ire it. In every-thing I will be governed by you: Yet I am a&s;hamed. What can I have to &s;ay, that my mother may not hear?&mdash;Nothing, no|thing. Your Clementina's heart, madam, is a part of yours.</P>
<P>My Love &s;hall be indulged in every thing. You and I, Camilla, will retire&mdash;Clementina was &s;ilent; and both withdrew.</P>
<P>She commanded me to &s;it down by her. I obeyed. It was not, in the &s;ituation I was in, for me to &s;peak fir&s;t. I attended her plea&s;ure in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed at a lo&s;s. She looked round her; then at me; then on the floor. I could not then forbear &s;peaking.</P>
<P>The mind of Lady Clementina, &s;aid I, &s;eems to have &s;omething upon it, that &s;he wi&s;hes to commu|nicate. You have not, madam, a more &s;incere, a more faithful friend, than the man before you. Your happine&s;s, and that of my Jeronymo, engro&s;s all my cares. Honour me with your confidence.</P>
<P>I had &s;omething to &s;ay: I had many que&s;tions to a&s;k&mdash;But pity me, Sir! my memory is gone: I have lo&s;t it all&mdash;But this I know, that we are all under ob|ligations to you, which we never can return: And I am unea&s;y under the &s;en&s;e of them.</P>
<P>What, madam, have I done, but an&s;wered to the call of friend&s;hip, which, in the like &s;ituation, not any one of your family but would have obeyed?&mdash;</P>
<P>This generous way of thinking adds to the obli|gation. Say but, Sir, in what way we can expre&s;s our gratitude, in what way I, in particular, can, and I &s;hall be ea&s;y. Till we have done it, I never &s;hall.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="89">
And can you, madam, think, that I am not highly rewarded, in the pro&s;pect of that &s;ucce&s;s which opens to all our wi&s;hes?</P>
<P>It may be &s;o in your opinion: But this leaves the debt &s;till heavier upon us.</P>
<P>How could I avoid con&s;truing the hint in my fa|vour? And yet I did not think the Lady, even had &s;he not had <HI>parents</HI> in being, had &s;he been ab&s;olutely in|dependent, well enough to determine for her&s;elf in a &s;ituation &s;o delicate. How then could I in honour (all her friends expecting that I &s;hould be entirely go|verned by her motions, as they were re&s;olved to be) take direct advantage of the gratitude which at that in&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her noble mind?</P>
<P>If, madam, an&s;wered I, you <HI>will</HI> &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elves under obligations to me, and will not be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> till you have acknowleged them, the return mu&s;t be a family act. Let me refer my&s;elf to your father, mother, bro|thers, and to your&s;elf: What you and they determine upon mu&s;t be right.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;ilence&mdash;Well, Sir, I believe you have put the matter upon a right footing: But <HI>here</HI> is my difficulty&mdash;You <HI>cannot</HI> be rewarded. <HI>I</HI> cannot reward you. But, Sir, the &s;ubject begins to be too much for me. I have high notions&mdash;My duty to God, and to my parents; my gratitude to you&mdash;But I have <HI>begun</HI> to write down all that has occurred to me on this im|portant &s;ubject. I wi&s;h to act greatly! You, Sir, have &s;et me the example. I will <HI>continue</HI> to write down my thoughts: I cannot tru&s;t to my memory&mdash;No, nor yet to my heart!&mdash;But no more on a &s;ubject that is at pre&s;ent too affecting to me. I will talk to my mother upon it fir&s;t; but not ju&s;t now; tho' I will a&s;k for the honour of her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>She then went from me into the next room; and in&s;tantly returned, leading in the Marchione&s;s. Don't, dear madam, be angry with me. I had many things to &s;ay to the Chevalier; which I thought I could be&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="90">
&s;ay, when I was alone with him; but I forget what they were. Indeed, I ought not to remember them, if they were &s;uch as I could not &s;ay before my mo|ther.</P>
<P>My child cannot do any-thing that can make me di&s;plea&s;ed with her. The Chevalier's genero&s;ity, and my Clementina's goodne&s;s of heart, can neither of them be doubted.</P>
<P>O, madam! What a deep &s;en&s;e have I of yours and of my Father's indulgence to me! How &s;hall I requite it!&mdash;How unworthy &s;hould I be of that re|turning rea&s;on, which &s;ometimes &s;eems to enliven my hope, if I were not to re&s;olve, that it &s;hall be wholly employed in my duty to God, and to you both! But even then, my gratitude to that generous man will leave a burden upon my heart, that never can be re|moved.</P>
<P>She withdrew with precipitation, leaving the Mar|chione&s;s and me, in &s;ilence, looking upon each other, and admiring her. Camilla followed her; and in|&s;tantly returning&mdash;My dear young Lady&mdash;Don't be frightened, madam&mdash;is not well. She &s;eems to have exhau&s;ted her &s;pirits by talking.</P>
<P>Tbe Marchione&s;s ha&s;tened in with Camilla. And while I was he&s;itating, whether to withdraw to Jero|nymo, or to quit the palace, Camilla came to me&mdash;My young Lady a&s;ks for you, Sir.</P>
<P>I followed her to her clo&s;et. She was in her mo|ther's arms, on a couch; ju&s;t come out of a fit; but not a &s;trong one. She held out her hand to me. I pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips. I was affected with her no|blene&s;s of mind, and weakne&s;s of &s;pirit&mdash;O Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, how unworthy am I of that tenderne&s;s which you expre&s;s for me! O that I could be grateful!&mdash;But God will reward you. He <HI>only</HI> can.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired her mother and me to leave her to her Camilla. We both withdrew.</P>
<P>What can be done with this dear creature, Che|valier?
<PB N="90" REF="91">
She is going to be bad again!&mdash;O, Sir! Her behaviour is now different from what it ever was!</P>
<P>She &s;eems, madam, to have &s;omething on her mind, that &s;he has a difficulty to reveal. When &s;he <HI>has</HI> re|vealed it, &s;he will be ea&s;ier. You will prevail upon her, madam, by your conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, to com|municate it to you. Allow me to withdraw to Signor Jeronymo. Lady Clementina, when &s;he is a little recovered, will acquaint you with what pa&s;&s;ed between her and me.</P>
<P>I heard it all, replied &s;he; and you are the mo&s;t honourable of men. What man would, what man <HI>could,</HI> have acted as you acted, with regard to her, with regard to us; yet not &s;light the dear creature's manife&s;t meaning; but refer it to us, and to her, to make it a family act? A family act it mu&s;t, ir <HI>&s;hall</HI> be. Only, Sir, let me be a&s;&s;ured, that my child's malady will not le&s;&s;en your Love for her: And per|mit her to be a Catholic!&mdash;The&s;e are all the terms, I, for <HI>my</HI> part, have to make with you. The re&s;t of us &s;till wi&s;h, that <HI>you</HI> would be &s;o, tho' but in appear|ance, for the &s;ake of our alliances. But I will not expect an an&s;wer to the la&s;t. As to the fir&s;t, you cannot be ungenerous to one who has &s;uffered &s;o much for her Love of you.</P>
<P>The Marquis and the Bi&s;hop entering the room, I leave it to you, madam, &s;aid I, to acquaint their Lord&s;hips with what has pa&s;&s;ed. I will attend Signor Jeronymo for a few moments.</P>
<P>I went accordingly to his chamber; but being told, that he was di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t, I withdrew with Mr Lowther into his: And there Camilla coming to me Mr. Lowther retiring, &s;he told me, that her young Lady was pretty well recovered. It was evident to her, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he never would be well till the marriage was &s;olemnized. They are all, &s;aid &s;he, in clo&s;e conference together, I believe upon that &s;ub|ject. My young Lady is endeavouring to compo&s;e

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XVII.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE><HI>June</HI> 7-18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, my dear friend, are matters here drawing to a cri&s;is. I was conducted, as &s;oon as I en|tered this palace, to the pre&s;ence of the Marquis and Marchione&s;s. The Marquis aro&s;e, and took my hand, with great, but &s;olemn kindne&s;s, and led me to a chair placed between theirs. The Bi&s;hop, the Count, and Father Mare&s;cotti, enter'd; and took their places.</P>
<P>My dear, &s;aid the Marquis, referring to his Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>After &s;ome little he&s;itation&mdash;We have no hope, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, of our child's perfect re&s;toration, but from&mdash;She &s;topt&mdash;</P>
<P>Our compliance with every wi&s;h of her heart, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Ay, do you proceed, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s to the Prelate.</P>
<P>It would be to no purpo&s;e, Chevalier, que&s;tioned the Bi&s;hop, to urge to you the topic &s;o near to all our hearts?</P>
<P>I bowed my a&s;&s;ent to what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it, replied the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>I am <HI>very</HI> &s;orry for it, &s;aid the Count.</P>
<P>What &s;ecurity can we a&s;k of you, Sir, &s;aid the Marquis, that our child &s;hall not be perverted?&mdash;O Chevalier! It is a hard, hard trial!</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
Father Mare&s;cotti, an&s;wered I, &s;hall pre&s;cribe the terms.</P>
<P>I cannot, in con&s;cience, &s;aid the Father, con&s;ent to this marriage: Yet the merits of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on have taken from me the power of oppo&s;ing it. Permit me to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti and I, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, are in one &s;ituation, as to &s;cruples of con&s;cience. But I will forget the Prelate for the Brother. Dear Grandi&s;on, will you permit us to &s;ay to enquirers, that we <HI>look</HI> upon you as one of our church; and that prudential rea&s;ons, with regard to your country, and friends in it, deter you at pre&s;ent from declaring your&s;elf?</P>
<P>Let not terms be propo&s;ed, my good Lord, that would le&s;&s;en your opinion of me, &s;hould I comply with them. If I am to be honoured with an ad|mi&s;&s;ion into this noble family, let me not in my own eyes appear unworthy of the honour. Were I to find my&s;elf capable of prevaricating in an article &s;o im|portant as religion, no one could hate me &s;o much as I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, were even an imperial diadem with your Clementina, the noble&s;t of women, to be the con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>You have the example of great princes, Chevalier, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, Henry the Fourth of France, Augu&s;tus of Poland&mdash;</P>
<P>True, Father&mdash;But great Princes are not always, and in every action of their lives, great men. <HI>They</HI> might make the le&s;s &s;cruple of changing their religion as they were neither of them &s;trict in the practice of it. They who can allow them&s;elves in <HI>&s;ome</HI> deviations, may in <HI>others.</HI> I boa&s;t not of my own virtue; but it has been my aim to be uniform. I am too well &s;ati&s;|fied with my own religion, to doubt: If I were not, it would be impo&s;&s;ible but I mu&s;t be influenced by the wi&s;hes of friends &s;o dear to me; who&s;e motives are the re&s;ult of their own piety, and of the regard they have for my everla&s;ting welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
The Chevalier and I, rejoined the Bi&s;hop, have car|ried this argument to its full extent before. My ho|noured Lord's que&s;tion recurs; What &s;ecurity can we have, that my &s;i&s;ter &s;hall not be perverted? The Che|valier refers to Father Mare&s;cotti to propo&s;e it. The Father excu&s;es him&s;elf. I, as the brother of Clemen|tina, a&s;k you, Chevalier, Will you promi&s;e never by your&s;elf, or your Engli&s;h divines, to attempt to pervert her?&mdash;A confe&s;&s;or you <HI>have</HI> allowed her. Shall Father Mare&s;cotti be the man?</P>
<P>And will Father Mare&s;cotti&mdash;</P>
<P>I will, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving to Lady Clemen|tina her faith; that faith by which only &s;he can be &s;aved; and, perhaps, in hope of converting the man who then will be dear to the whole family.</P>
<P>I not only comply with the propo&s;al, but &s;hall think Father Mare&s;cotti will do me a favour, in putting it into my power to &s;hew him the regard I have for him. One reque&s;t I have only to make; That Father Ma|re&s;cotti will pre&s;cribe his own conditions to me. And I a&s;&s;ure you all, that they &s;hall be exceeded, as to the con&s;ideration, be they ever &s;o high.</P>
<P>You and I, Chevalier, replied the Father, &s;hall have no difficulty, as to the terms.</P>
<P>None you can have, &s;aid the Marquis, as to tho&s;e. Father Mare&s;cotti will be &s;till <HI>our</HI> &s;piritual director.</P>
<P>Only one condition I will beg leave to make with Father Mare&s;cotti; that he will confine his pious cares to tho&s;e only who are already of his own per&s;ua&s;ion; and that no di&s;putable points may ever be touched upon to &s;ervants, tenants, or neighbours, in a country where a different religion, from that to which he is a credit, is e&s;tabli&s;hed. I might, perhaps, have &s;afely left this to his own moderation and honour; yet, without &s;uch a previous engagement, his con&s;cience might have been embarra&s;&s;ed; and had I not in&s;i&s;ted on it, I &s;hould have behaved towards my country in a manner for which I could not an&s;wer to my own heart.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">
Your countrymen, Chevalier, &s;aid the Count, com|plain loudly of per&s;ecution from our church: Yet what di&s;qualifications do Catholics lie under in Eng|land!</P>
<P>A great deal, my Lord, may be &s;aid on this &s;ubject. I think it &s;ufficient to an&s;wer for my&s;elf, and my own conduct.</P>
<P>As to our child's &s;ervants, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, methinks I &s;hould hope, that Father Mare&s;cotti might have a &s;mall congregation about him, to keep their Lady in countenance, in a country where her religion will &s;ubject her to inconveniencies, perhaps to <HI>more</HI> than inconveniencies.</P>
<P>Her woman, and tho&s;e &s;ervants, replied I, who will immediately attend her per&s;on, &s;hall always be cho&s;en by her&s;elf. If they behave well, I will con&s;ider them as <HI>my</HI> &s;ervants for their benefit. If they misbehave, I mu&s;t be allowed to con&s;ider them al&s;o as my &s;ervants, as well as their Lady's. I mu&s;t not be &s;ubject to the dominion of &s;ervants, the mo&s;t intolerable of all do|minion. Were they to know that they are indepen|dent of me, I &s;hould be di&s;obeyed, perhaps in&s;ulted; and my re&s;entment of their in&s;olence would be thought a per&s;ecution on account of their religion.</P>
<P>This article bore &s;ome canva&s;&s;ing. If Camilla, at la&s;t, I &s;aid, were the woman; on her di&s;cretion I &s;hould have great dependence.</P>
<P>&mdash;And on Father Mare&s;cotti's you al&s;o may, Che|valier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. I &s;hould hope, that when my &s;i&s;ter and you are in England together, you would not <HI>&s;cruple</HI> to con&s;ult him on the misbehaviour of any of my &s;i&s;ter's Catholic &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, I <HI>would.</HI> I will my&s;elf be judge in my own hou&s;e of the conduct and behaviour of all my &s;ervants. From the independence of &s;uch people upon me, di&s;putes or unea&s;ine&s;&s;es might ari&s;e, that otherwi&s;e would never happen between their Lady and me. The power of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, on any flagrant mi&s;behaviour,
<PB N="95" REF="96">
mu&s;t be in me. My temper is not capricious: My charity is not confined: My con&s;ideration for people in a foreign country, and wholly in my power, will, I hope, be even generous. I perhaps may bear with them the more for having them in my power. But my wife's &s;ervants, were &s;he a &s;overeign, mu&s;t be mine.</P>
<P>Unhappy! &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, that you can not be of one faith! But, Sir, you will allow, I hope, if the ca&s;e will bear it, of expo&s;tulation from me?</P>
<P>Yes, Father: And &s;hould <HI>generally,</HI> I believe, be determined by your advice and mediation. But I would not <HI>condition</HI> to make the greate&s;t &s;aint, and the wi&s;e&s;t man on earth, a judge in my own family over me.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on in this, rejoined the Bi&s;hop: You, perhaps, would not &s;cruple, Sir, to con&s;ult the Mar|chione&s;s, before you dimi&s;&s;ed &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;er|vant as a woman, if my &s;i&s;ter did not agree to it?</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s will be judges of my conduct, when I am in Italy. I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, were it not to be the &s;ame in England as at Bologna. I have in my travels been attended by Ca|tholic Servants. They never had rea&s;on to complain of want of kindne&s;s, even to indulgence, from me. We Prote&s;tants confine not &s;alvation within the pale of our own church, Catholics do; and have therefore an argument for their zeal in endeavouring to make pro&s;elvtes, that we have not. Hence, generally &s;peak|ing, may a Catholic &s;ervant live more happily with a Prote&s;tant ma&s;ter, than a Prote&s;tant &s;ervant with a Ca|tholic ma&s;ter. Let my &s;ervants live but up to their own profe&s;&s;ions, and they &s;hall be indulged with all rea&s;onable opportunities of pur&s;uing the dictates of their own con&s;ciences. A truly religious &s;ervant, of whatever per&s;ua&s;ion, cannot be a bad one.</P>
<P>Well, as to this article, we mu&s;t leave it, acquie&s;ced the Bi&s;hop, to occa&s;ions as they may ari&s;e. Nine
<PB N="96" REF="97">
months in the year, I think you propo&s;e to re&s;ide in Italy&mdash;</P>
<P>That, my Lord, was on a &s;uppo&s;ition that Lady Clementina would not oblige me with her company to my native country any part of the year; in that ca&s;e, I propo&s;ed to pa&s;s but three months in every year in my native country: Otherwi&s;e, I hoped that year and year, in turn, would be allowed me.</P>
<P>We can have no wi&s;h to &s;eparate man and wife, &s;aid the Marquis. Clementina will, no doubt, ac|company her hu&s;band. We will &s;tipulate only for year and year: But let ours be the fir&s;t year: And we cannot doubt but the dear child will meet with all rea&s;onable indulgence, for the &s;ake of her tender health.</P>
<P>Not one reque&s;t that you, my Lord, and you, ma|dam, &s;hall think rea&s;onable, &s;hall be denied to the dear Lady.</P>
<P>Let <HI>me</HI> propo&s;e one thing, Chevalier, &s;aid the Mar|chione&s;s; that in the fir&s;t year, which is to be ours, you endeavour to prevail upon your &s;i&s;ters, amiable women, as we have heard they are, to come over, and be of our acquaintance: Your Ward al&s;o, who may be looked upon as a little Italian. You love your &s;i&s;ters; and I &s;hould be glad, &s;o would Clementina, I make no doubt, to be familiarized to the Ladies of your family before &s;he goes to England.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ters, madam, are the mo&s;t obliging of wo|men, as their Lords are of men. I have no doubt of prevailing upon them, to attend you and Lady Cle|mentina here. And as it will give them time to prepare for the vi&s;it, I believe, if it be made in the latter part of the fir&s;t year, it will be mo&s;t acceptable to them, and to you; &s;ince then they will not only have commenced a friend&s;hip with Lady Clementina, and obtained the honour of your good opinion; but will attend the dear Lady in her voyage to Eng|land.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">
They all approved of this. I added, that I hoped, when the &s;econd year arrived, I &s;hould have the ho|nour of finding in the party &s;ome of this noble fa|mily (looking round me) which could not fail of give|ing delight, as well as affiance, to the tender heart of their beloved Clementina.</P>
<P>My Lord and I, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, will pro|bably, if well, be of the party. We &s;hall not know how to part with a child &s;o dear to us&mdash;But the&s;e &s;eas&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, this is a contingence, and mu&s;t be left to time, and to the Chevalier and my &s;i&s;ter, when they are one. As his is the &s;tronge&s;t mind, it will, in all rea&s;onable matters, yield to the weaker&mdash;Now, as to my &s;i&s;ter's fortune&mdash;</P>
<P>It is a large one, &s;aid the Count. We &s;hall all take plea&s;ure in adding to it.</P>
<P>Should there be more &s;ons than one by the marriage, rejoined the Bi&s;hop, as the e&s;tate of her two grand|fathers will be an ample provi&s;ion for one of them, and your Engli&s;h e&s;tate for another, I hope we may expect that the education of one of them may be left to us.</P>
<P>Every one &s;aid, this was a very rea&s;onable expect|ation.</P>
<P>I cannot condition for this, my Lord. The edu|cation of the &s;ons was to be left to me; that of the daughters, to the mother. I will con&s;ent, that the Italian e&s;tate &s;hall be tied up for daughters portions; and that they &s;hall be brought up under your own eyes, Italians. The &s;ons &s;hall have no benefit by the Italian e&s;tate&mdash;</P>
<P>Except they become Catholics, Chevalier, added the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>No, my Lord, replied I: That might be a tempta|tion&mdash;Tho' I would leave po&s;terity as free, as I my|&s;elf am left, in the article of religion; yet would I not lay any &s;nares for them. I am for having them
<PB N="98" REF="99">
ab&s;olutely &s;ecluded from any po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying that e&s;tate, as they will be Engli&s;hmen. Cannot this be done by the laws of your country, and the tenure by which the&s;e e&s;tates are held?</P>
<P>If Clementina marry, &s;aid the Marquis, whether there be i&s;&s;ue or not, Laurana's claim cea&s;es. But, Chevalier, can you think it ju&s;t to deprive children unborn of their natural right?</P>
<P>I have a very good e&s;tate: It is improving. I have con&s;iderable expectations be&s;ides. That is not mine which I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and &s;hall have no right to, but by marriage; and which, therefore, mu&s;t and ought to be &s;ubject to marriage-articles. Riches never made men happy. If my de&s;cendants will not be &s;o with a competence, they will not with a redundance. I hope Signor Jeronymo may recover, and marry: Let the e&s;tate here, from the hour that I &s;hall be honour|ed with the hand of your dear Clementina, be Jero|nymo's, and his po&s;terity's for ever. If it &s;hall be thought proper for him, on taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to make his &s;i&s;ter any brotherly acknowlegement, it &s;hall be to her &s;ole and &s;eparate u&s;e, and not &s;ubject to any controul of mine. If Signor Jeronymo marry not, or if he do, and die without i&s;&s;ue, let the e&s;tate in que&s;tion be the General's. He and his Lady de&s;erve every-thing. The e&s;tate &s;hall not, by my con&s;ent, go out of the name.</P>
<P>They looked upon each other&mdash;Brother, &s;aid the Count, I &s;ee not, but we may leave every-thing to the genero&s;ity of &s;uch a young man as this. He quite overcomes me.</P>
<P>A di&s;intere&s;ted and generous man, rejoined the Bi|&s;hop, is born a ruler; and he is, at the &s;ame time, the greate&s;t of politicians, were policy only to be con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t equitable medium, I think, re&s;umed the Marchione&s;s, is what the Chevalier hinted at&mdash;and mo&s;t an&s;werable to the intention of the dear child's
<PB N="99" REF="100">
grandfathers: It is, that the e&s;tate in que&s;tion be &s;e|cured to the daughters of the marriage. Our &s;ons will be greatly provided for: And it will be reward|ing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Chevalier for his genero&s;ity, that the &s;ons of the marriage &s;hall not have their pa|trimony le&s;&s;ened, by the provi&s;ion to be made for daughters.</P>
<P>They all generou&s;ly applauded the Marchione&s;s; and propo&s;ing this expedient to me, I bowed my grate|ful a&s;&s;ent&mdash;See, Chevalier, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, what a generous family you are likely to be allied with! O that you could be &s;ubdued by a goodne&s;s &s;o much like your own, and declare your&s;elf a Catholic! His Holine&s;s him&s;elf (my Lord the Bi&s;hop could engage) would receive you with ble&s;&s;ings, at the foot&s;tool of his throne. You allow, Sir, that &s;alvation may be obtained in our church: Out of it, <HI>we</HI> think it can|not. Rejoice us all. Rejoice, Lady Clementina&mdash;and let us know no bound in our joy.</P>
<P>What opinion, my dear Father Mare&s;cotti, would you all have of the man who could give up his con|&s;cience, tho' for the highe&s;t con&s;ideration on earth?&mdash;Did you, could you, think the better of the two princes mentioned to me, for the change of their re|ligion? One of them was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the &s;treets of his metropolis, by an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who que&s;tioned the &s;incerity of his change. Could the matter be of <HI>in|difference</HI> to me&mdash;But, my dear Father Mare&s;cotti, let us leave this to be debated hereafter between you and me, as father and &s;on. Your piety &s;hall command my reverence: But pain not my heart, by putting me on denial of any-thing that &s;hall be a&s;ked of me, by &s;uch re&s;pectable and generous per&s;ons, as tho&s;e I am before; and when we are talking on a &s;ubject &s;o de|licate, and &s;o important.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti, we mu&s;t give up this point, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. The Chevalier and I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed it heretofore. He is a determined man. If you here|after
<PB N="100" REF="101">
can gain upon him, you will make us all happy. But now, my Lord, to the Marqui&s;s, let the Chevalier know, what he will have with my &s;i&s;ter, be&s;ides the beque&s;ts of her Grandfathers, from <HI>your</HI> bounty; and from <HI>yours,</HI> madam, to his mother, as a daughter of your hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I beg my Lord, one word, &s;aid I, to the Marquis, before you &s;peak. Let not a &s;yllable of this be men|tioned to me now. Whatever you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to do of this nature, let it be done annually, as my be|haviour to your daughter may de&s;erve. Do I not know the genero&s;ity of every one of this noble family? Let me be in your power. I have enough for her, and for me, or I do not know the noble Clementina. What|ever you do, for the &s;ake of your own magnificence, that do: But let us leave particulars unmentioned.</P>
<P>What would Lady Sforza &s;ay, were &s;he pre&s;ent? rejoined the Count. Aver&s;e as &s;he is to the alliance, &s;he would admire the man.</P>
<P>Are you earne&s;t in your reque&s;t, Chevalier, a&s;ked the Bi&s;hop, that particulars &s;hall not be mentioned?</P>
<P>I <HI>beg</HI> they may not. I <HI>earne&s;tly</HI> beg it.</P>
<P>Pray let the Chevalier be obliged, returned the Pre|late&mdash;Sir, &s;aid he, and &s;natched my hand, brother, friend, what &s;hall I call you?&mdash;We <HI>will</HI> oblige you; but not in doubt of your kind treatment of Clementina. She mu&s;t, &s;he <HI>will,</HI> de&s;erve it; but that we may have it in our power to be revenged of you: Sir, we will take great revenge of you: And let us now rejoice Jeronymo's heart with an account of all that has pa&s;&s;ed. We might have held this conference before him. All that is further nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, may be &s;aid in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Who, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, can hold out again&s;t the Chevalier Grandi&s;on? I will tell every one who &s;hall que&s;tion me on this alliance, zealous Catholics, with a Prote&s;tant &s;o determined, what a man he is; and then they will allow of this one particular excep|tion to a general rule.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
All we have now to do, &s;aid the Marquis, is to gain his Holine&s;s's permi&s;&s;ion. That has not been refu&s;ed in &s;uch ca&s;es, where either the &s;ons or daugh|ters of the marriage are to be brought up Catholics.</P>
<P>The Count then took the Marchione&s;s's hand; the Marquis that of the Father. They whi&s;pered together as they walked; as I could hear, not to my di&s;advan|tage. The Bi&s;hop took mine, and we entered Jero|nymo's chamber together. I &s;tept into Mr. Lowther's apartment, while they related to him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. He was impatient to &s;ee me. The Bi&s;hop led me in to him. He embraced me as his brother. Now, now, my dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, I am indeed happy. This is the point to which I have long directed all my wi&s;hes. God grant that our dear Clementina's ma|lady may be no drawback upon your felicities; and you mu&s;t both then be happy.</P>
<P>I was &s;en&s;ible of a little abatement, on the Bi&s;hop's &s;aying to his mother, not knowing I heard him, Ah, madam! the poor Count of Belvedere&mdash;How will <HI>he</HI> be affected!&mdash;But he will go to Madrid; and I hope make him&s;elf happy there with &s;ome Spani&s;h Lady.

<P>WELL, my dear &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;And what &s;ay you to the contents of the three inclo&s;ed Letters? I wi&s;h I had been with you, and Lord L. at the time you read them, that I might have mingled my tears with yours, for the &s;weet Harriet! Why would my brother di&s;patch the&s;e Letters, without &s;taying till at lea&s;t, he could have informed us of the re&s;ult of the next day's meeting with Clementina? What was the opportunity that he had to &s;end away the&s;e Letters, which he mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured would keep us in &s;trange &s;u&s;pen&s;e? <HI>Lang</HI> the opportunity that &s;o officiou&s;ly offered!&mdash;But, per|haps, in the tenderne&s;s of his nature, he thought that this di&s;patch was nece&s;&s;ary, to prepare us for what was to follow, le&s;t, were he to acquaint us with the event as decided, our emotion would be too great to be

&s;upported&mdash;We &s;i&s;ters, to go over to attend Lady CLEMENTINA GRANDISON, a twelvemonth hence&mdash;Ah the poor Harriet! And will &s;he give us leave? But it &s;urely mu&s;t not, cannot be!&mdash;And yet&mdash;Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, hu&s;h, Charlotte!&mdash;And proceed to facts.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, when the&s;e Letters were brought him po&s;t from London, was with us at table. We had but ju&s;t dined. He aro&s;e, and retired to his own apart|ment with them. We were all impatient to know the contents. When I thought he had withdrawn long enough to read di&s;patches of a mile long, and yet found that he returned not, my impatience was heightened; and the dear Harriet &s;aid, Bad news, I fear! I hope Sir Charles is well! I hope Lady Clementina is not relap&s;ed! The good Jeronymo! I &s;ear for him.</P>
<P>I then &s;tept up to the Doctor's room. He was &s;it|ting with his back towards the door, in a pen&s;ive mood; and when, hearing &s;omebody enter, he turned about, I &s;aw he had been deeply affected!&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear Dr. Bartlett;&mdash;For God's &s;ake!&mdash;How is my brother?&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't be affrighted, madam! All are well in Italy&mdash;In a way to be well&mdash;But, alas!&mdash;Tears &s;tarted afre&s;h&mdash;I am grieved for Mi&s;s Byron!</P>
<P>How, how, Doctor! Is my brother married?&mdash;It cannot, it &s;hall not be!&mdash;Is my brother married?</P>
<P>O no, not married, by the&s;e Letters! But all is concluded upon! Sweet, &s;weet, Mi&s;s Byron! Now, indeed, will her magnanimity be put to the te&s;t!&mdash;Yet Lady Clementina is a mo&s;t excellent woman!&mdash;<HI>You,</HI> madam, may read the&s;e Letters: Mi&s;s Byron, I believe, mu&s;t not. You will &s;ee, by the conclude|ing part of the la&s;t, how greatly embarra&s;&s;ed my Pa|tron mu&s;t be between his honour to one Lady, and his tenderne&s;s for the other. Which-&s;oever &s;hall be his, how much will the other be to be pitied!</P>
<P>I ran over, with a weeping eye, as the paragraphs &s;truck me, the pa&s;&s;ages mo&s;t affecting. O Dr. Bart|lett,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
&s;aid I, when I had done, how &s;hall we break this news to Mrs Selby, to Mrs Shirley, to my Har|riet!&mdash;A trial, indeed, of her magnanimity!&mdash;Yet, to have received Letters from my brother, and to de|lay going down, will be as alarming as to tell it. Let us go down.</P>
<P>Do you, madam, take the Letters. You have ten|derne&s;s: Your prudence cannot be doubted&mdash;I will attend you by-and-by. His eyes were ready to run over.</P>
<P>I went down. I met <HI>my</HI> Lord at the &s;tairs foot. How, how, madam, does Sir Charles?&mdash;O my Lord! we are all undone. My brother, by this time, is the hu&s;band of Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>He was &s;truck, as with a thunderbolt! God forbid! were all the words he could &s;peak; and turned as pale as death.</P>
<P>I love him, for his &s;incere Love to my Harriet. I wrung his hand&mdash;The Letters do not &s;ay it. But every-body is con&s;enting; and if it be not already &s;o, it &s;oon will&mdash;Step, my Lord, to Mrs. Selby, and tell her, that I wi&s;h to &s;ee her in the flower-garden.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron and Nancy, &s;aid he, are gone to walk in the garden. She was &s;o apprehen&s;ive, on your &s;taying above, and the Doctor not coming down, that &s;he was forced to walk into the air. I left Mr. Selby, his Lady, Emily, and Lucy, in the dining-parlour, to find you, and let you know, how every-body was affected. Tears dropt on his cheeks.</P>
<P>I gave him my hand in love. I was plea&s;ed with him. I called him my dear Lord.</P>
<P>I think our &s;weet friend once &s;aid, that fear made us loving. Ill-news will oblige us to look about us for con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I found the per&s;ons named, ju&s;t ri&s;ing from their &s;eats to walk in the garden&mdash;O my dear Mrs. Selby, &s;aid I, all is agreed upon in Italy.</P>
<P>They were all dumb but Emily. <HI>Her</HI> &s;orrow was
<PB N="105" REF="106">
audible: She wrung her hands; &s;he was ready to faint; her Anne was called to take care of her; and &s;he retired.</P>
<P>I then told Mr. and Mrs. Selby what were the con|tents of the la&s;t Letter of the three. Mr. Selby broke out into pa&s;&s;ionate grief&mdash;I know not what the ho|nour <HI>is,</HI> &s;aid he, that could oblige Sir Charles, treated as he had been by the proud Italians, to go over at the fir&s;t invitation. One might have gue&s;&s;ed that it would have come to this&mdash;Oh! the poor Harriet! flower of the world! She de&s;erved not to be made a &s;econd woman, to the &s;tatelie&s;t minx in Italy: But this is my comfort, &s;he is &s;uperior to them both. Upon my &s;oul, madam, &s;he is. The man, were he a king, that could prefer another woman to our Harriet, does not de&s;erve her.</P>
<P>He then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and walked up and down the room in anger; and afterwards &s;itting down, My dear Mrs. Selby, &s;aid he, we &s;hall now &s;ee what the &s;o often pleaded for dignity of your Sex, in the noble&s;t-minded, will enable you to do. But, O the dear &s;oul! She will find a difference between theory and practice!</P>
<P>Lucy wept. Her grief was &s;ilent. Mrs. Selby dried her eyes &s;everal times. My dear Lady G. &s;aid &s;he, at la&s;t, how &s;hall we break this to Harriet? <HI>You</HI> mu&s;t do it; and &s;he will apply to me for comfort&mdash;Pray, Mr. Selby, be patient. You mu&s;t not reflect upon Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Indeed you &s;hould not, Sir, &s;aid I. He is to be pitied. I will read you the concluding part of his la&s;t Letter.</P>
<P>I did.</P>
<P>But Mr. Selby would not be pacified. He tried to blame my brother.</P>
<P>After all, my dear, the&s;e Lords of the creation are more violent, more unrea&s;onable, and, of con&s;equence, more &s;illy and perver&s;e, more babies, if you plea&s;e,
<PB N="106" REF="107">
than we women, when they are di&s;appointed in any|thing they &s;et their hearts upon. But in every ca&s;e, I believe, one extreme borders on another. What a fool has Otway made of Ca&s;talio, raving again&s;t the whole &s;ex, by a common-place invective, on a mere temporary di&s;appointment; when the fault, and all the dreadful con&s;equences that attended it, were owing to his own ba&s;ene&s;s of heart, in being a&s;hamed to acquaint his brother, that he meant honourable Love to the unhappy orphan, who was intitled to inviolable protection! Whenever I &s;aw this play, I pitied the impetuous Polydore, more than I did the blubbering great boy Ca&s;talio; tho' I thought both brothers de|&s;erved to be hanged.</P>
<P>As we were meditating how to break this matter to our lovely friend, Mrs. Shirley came to Selby-hou&s;e in her chariot. We immediately acquainted her with it. No &s;urprizes affect her &s;teady &s;oul. This can't be helped, &s;aid &s;he. Our dear girl her&s;elf expects it. May <HI>I</HI> read the Letter that contains the affecting tidings? She took it. She run it over &s;lightly, to enable her&s;elf to &s;peak to the contents&mdash;Excellent man!&mdash;How happy &s;hould we have been, ble&s;&s;ed with the enjoyment of our wi&s;hes! But you, Mrs. Selby, and I, have always pitied Lady Clementina. His generous regard for our child is too apparent for his own tranquillity. God comfort him, and our Harriet! O the dear creature! Her fading cheeks have &s;hewn the &s;truggles of her heart, in &s;uch an expectation&mdash;Where is my child?</P>
<P>I was running out to &s;ee for her; and met her ju&s;t a&s;cending the &s;teps that lead from the garden into the hou&s;e. Your grandmamma, my love, &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>I hear &s;he is come, an&s;wered &s;he. I am ha&s;tening to pay my duty to her.</P>
<P>But how do you, Harriet?</P>
<P>A little better for the air! I &s;ent up to Dr. Bartlett, and he has let me know, that Sir Charles is well, and every-body better: And I am ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">
She hurried in to her grandmother, rejoicing, as &s;he always does to &s;ee h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r. She kneeled; received her tender ble&s;&s;ing. And what brings my grand|mamma to her girl?</P>
<P>The day is fine; the air, and the &s;ight of my Har|riet, I thought would do me good&mdash;You have Letters, I find, from Italy, my Love?</P>
<P><HI>I,</HI> madam, have not: Dr. Bartlett has: But I am not-to know the contents, I &s;uppo&s;e. Something, I doubt not, that will be thought unwelcome to me, by their not being communicated. But as long as every|body there is well, I <HI>can</HI> have patience. Time will reveal all things.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, who admires the old Lady, and is as much admired by her, came down, and paid his re|&s;pects to her. Mrs. Shirley had returned me the Let|ters. I &s;lid them into the Doctor's hand, unperceived by Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>I am told, &s;aid &s;he, that my Emily is not well; I will ju&s;t a&s;k how &s;he does&mdash;And was going from us&mdash;No, don't, my love, &s;aid her aunt, taking her hand, Emily &s;hall come down to us.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, by the compa&s;&s;ionate looks of every|one, that &s;omething is the matter. If it be any-thing that mo&s;t concerns me to know, don't, through a mi&s;|taken tenderne&s;s, let me be the la&s;t to whom it is communicated. But I <HI>gue&s;s</HI>&mdash;with a forced &s;mile.</P>
<P>What does my Harriet gue&s;s? &s;aid her aunt.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, replied &s;he, has acquainted me, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is well; and that his friends are on the recovery: Is it not then ea&s;y to gue&s;s, by every|one's &s;ilence on the contents of the Letters brought to Dr. Bartlett, that Sir Charles is either married, or near being &s;o; What &s;ay you, my good Dr. Bartlett?</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent; but tears were in his eyes. She turned round, and &s;aw us with our handkerchiefs at ours. Her uncle, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, &s;tood with his back to us, at one of the windows.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">
Well, my dear friends, and you are all <HI>grieved</HI> for me. It is kind, and I can thank you for your <HI>concern</HI> for me, becau&s;e the man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on&mdash;And &s;o, Doctor, laying her hand upon his, he is actually married? God Almighty, piou&s;ly bending one knee, make him and his Clementina happy!&mdash;Well, my deare&s;t dear friends, and what is there in this, more than I expected?</P>
<P>Her aunt embraced her.</P>
<P>Her uncle ran to her, and cla&s;ped his arms about her; Now, now, &s;aid he, have you overcome me, my niece: For the future I never will di&s;pute with you on &s;ome of the arguments I have heretofore held again&s;t your Sex. Were all women like you&mdash;</P>
<P>Her grandmother, as &s;he &s;at, held out her open arms: My own Harriet! child of my heart! let me fold you to it!&mdash;She ran to her, and cla&s;ped her knees, as the old Lady threw her arms about her neck&mdash;Pray for me, however, my grandmamma&mdash;that I may act up to my judgment, and as your child, and my aunt Selby's!&mdash;It <HI>is</HI> a trial&mdash;I own it&mdash;But per|mit me to withdraw for a few moments.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and was ha&s;tening out of the room; but her aunt took her hand; My deare&s;t love, &s;aid &s;he, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is not married&mdash;But&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, why, interrupted &s;he, if it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o, is it <HI>not</HI> &s;o?</P>
<P>At that moment in came Emily. She had been try|ing to &s;uppre&s;s her concern; and fan&s;ied, it &s;eems, that &s;he had recovered her pre&s;ence of Mind: But the moment &s;he &s;aw her beloved Mi&s;s Byron, her fortitude for&s;ook her. She gu&s;hed into tears, and, &s;obbing, would have quitted the room; but Mi&s;s Byron, &s;tepping after her, caught her arm; My Emily, my Love, my Friend, my Si&s;ter! fly me not: Let me give you an example, my dear!&mdash;I am not a&s;hamed to own my|&s;elf affected: But I have fortitude, I hope!&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, when he could not be happy from
<PB N="109" REF="110">
his own affairs, made him&s;elf a partaker in the hap|pine&s;s of others; and &s;hall not you and I, after &s;o great an example, rejoice in <HI>his?</HI></P>
<P>I am, I am&mdash;grieved, replied the &s;obbing girl, for my Mi&s;s Byron. I don't love Italian Ladies! Were you, madam, turning to her, Lady Grandi&s;on, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t creature in the world.</P>
<P>But, Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid I, may we not, now that Mi&s;s Byron knows the wor&s;t, communicate to her the contents of the&s;e Letters?</P>
<P>I hope you will, Sir, &s;aid Mrs. Shirley. You &s;ee that my Harriet is a noble girl.</P>
<P>I rely upon your judgments, Ladies, an&s;wered the Doctor; and put the Letters into Mrs. Shirley's hands.</P>
<P>I <HI>have</HI> read them, &s;aid I. We will leave Mrs. Shir|ley, Mrs. Selby, and Mi&s;s Byron, together. We, Lucy, Nancy, Emily, will take a walk in the garden. Shall we have your company, Dr. Bartlett? I &s;aw he was <HI>de&s;irous</HI> to withdraw. Lucy <HI>de&s;ired</HI> to &s;tay be|hind. Harriet looked, as if &s;he wi&s;hed Lucy to &s;tay; and I led the other two into the garden, Dr. Bartlett leaving us at the entrance into it; and I told them the contents of the Letters, as we walked.</P>
<P>They were greatly affected, as I thought they would be; which made me lead them out. Lord G. joined us in our walk, as well as in our concern; &s;o that the dear Harriet had none but comforters left about her; who enabled her to &s;upport her &s;pirits; for Mrs. Shirley and Mrs. Selby had always applauded the preference their beloved child was &s;o ready to give to Clementina, becau&s;e of her malady; tho' it is evident, again&s;t their wi&s;hes. There never were three nobler women re|lated to each other than Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, and Mi&s;s Byron. But Mr. Selby is by no means &s;ati&s;|fied, that my brother, loving Harriet, as he <HI>evidently</HI> does, &s;hould be &s;o ready to leave her, and go to Italy. <HI>His</HI> cen&s;ure ari&s;es from his Love to my brother and to his niece: But I need not tell you, that, tho' a <HI>man,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="111">
he has not a &s;oul half &s;o capacious as that of either of the three Ladies I have named.</P>
<P>At our return from our little walk, it was lovely to &s;ee Harriet take her Emily a&s;ide, to comfort her, and to plead with her in favour of my brother's obliga|tions; as afterwards &s;he did again&s;t her uncle. How the generous creature &s;hone in my eyes, and in tho&s;e of every-one pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>When &s;he and I were alone, &s;he took grateful no|tice of the concluding part of the third Letter; where &s;he is mentioned with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, and in a manner &s;o truly worthy of the character of the po|lite&s;t of men, as well re&s;pecting her&s;elf as her Sex, charging him&s;elf with vanity and pre&s;umption, but to &s;uppo&s;e to him&s;elf, that Mi&s;s Byron wanted his com|pa&s;&s;ion, or had the tender regard for him, that he avows for her. She plea&s;ed her&s;elf, that he had not <HI>&s;een</HI> the very great e&s;teem &s;he had for him, as you and I had done: And how <HI>could</HI> he, you know? &s;aid &s;he; for he and I were not often together; and I was under obligation enough to him to make him attribute my regard to gratitude: But it is plain, proceeded &s;he, that he <HI>loves</HI> the poor Harriet&mdash;Don't you think &s;o? and perhaps would have given her a preference to all other women, had he not been circum&s;tanced as he was. Well, God ble&s;s him, added &s;he; he was my fir&s;t Love; and I never will have any other&mdash;Don't blame me for this declaration, my dear Lady G. My Grandmamma, as well as you, once chid me for &s;ay|ing &s;o, and called me <HI>romancer</HI>&mdash;But is not the man Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>But, alas! with all the&s;e appearances, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that this amiable creature's &s;olitary hours are heavy ones. She has got a habit of &s;ighing. She ri&s;es with &s;welled eyes: Sleep for&s;akes her: Her ap|petite fails: And &s;he is very &s;en&s;ible of all this; as &s;he &s;hews, by the pains &s;he takes to conceal the alteration.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t Harriet Byron, ble&s;&s;ed with beauty &s;o
<PB N="111" REF="112">
unequalled; health &s;o blooming; a temper &s;o even; pa&s;&s;ions &s;o governable; generous and grateful, even to heroi&s;m!&mdash;Superior to every woman in frankne&s;s of heart, in true delicacy; and in an under&s;tanding and judgment beyond her years&mdash;Mu&s;t <HI>&s;he</HI> be offered up, as a victim on the altar of hopele&s;s Love!&mdash;I de|precate &s;uch a fate;&mdash;I cannot allow the other Sex &s;uch a triumph, tho' the man be my brother. It is, however, none; on the contrary, it is apparently a grief to his noble and truly manly heart, that &s;o ex|cellent a creature cannot be the &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane came hither this morning. He is a va|luable man. He opened his heart to me about an hour ago. He always, he &s;ays, de&s;igned Mi&s;s Byron for the heire&s;s of the principal part of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and he let me know his circum&s;tances; which are great. It is, I am convinced, true policy to be good. Young and old, rich and poor, dote upon Mi&s;s Byron. You remember what her uncle &s;ays in his ludicrous Letter to her, covertly prai&s;ing her, by pretending to find fault with her, that he is more noted for being the uncle of Mi&s;s Byron, than &s;he is for being his niece; tho' of &s;o long &s;tanding in the county: And I a&s;&s;ure you, he is much re&s;pected too. But &s;uch beauty, &s;uch affability, a character &s;o benevolent, &s;o frank, &s;o pious, yet &s;o chearful and unaffected, as hers is, mu&s;t com|mand the veneration and love of every one.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane is extremely apprehen&s;ive of her decline|ing health. He believes her in a con&s;umption; and has brought a phy&s;ician of his intimate acquaintance to vi&s;it her: But &s;he, and we all are convinced, that medicine will not reach her ca&s;e: And &s;he affected to be &s;tartled at his &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was in &s;o bad a way, on purpo&s;e, as &s;he owned, to avoid his kind impor|tunity to take advice in a malady that nothing but time and patience can cure.</P>
<P>A charming corre&s;pondence is carried on between Harriet and the Counte&s;s of D. Harriet is all frank|ne&s;s
<PB N="112" REF="113">
in it; &s;o is Lady D. One day I hope to procure you a &s;ight of their Letters. I am allowed to inclo&s;e a copy of the Counte&s;s's la&s;t. You will &s;ee the force of the rea&s;oning, on Harriet's declaration, that &s;he will never think of a &s;econd Lover. Her grandmother is entirely with the Counte&s;s. So am I&mdash;Tho' the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>What will become of Lady Olivia, if the alliance between my brother and the Bologna family take effect?&mdash;She has her emi&s;&s;aries, who I &s;uppo&s;e will &s;oon appri&s;e her of it. How will &s;he flame out! I &s;uppo&s;e you, who corre&s;pond with her, will &s;oon be troubled with her invectives on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All here wi&s;h for you and Lord L. For my part, I long to &s;ee you both, and to be &s;een by you. You never could &s;ee me more to my advantage than now. We have nothing between us. But&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What your Lord&s;hip plea&s;es."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My deare&s;t life, you have <HI>no</HI> choice."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You <HI>prevent</HI> me, my Lord, in all my wi&s;hes."</Q></P>
<P>I have told him, in Love, of &s;ome of his foibles: And he thanks me for my in&s;truction; and is re&s;olved to be all I wi&s;h him to be.</P>
<P>I have made di&s;coveries in his favour&mdash;More wit, more humour, more good &s;en&s;e, more learning, than I had ever till now, that I was willing to enquire after tho&s;e qualities in him, imagined he had. He allows me to have a va&s;t &s;hare of good under&s;tanding; and &s;o he ought, when I have made &s;uch di&s;coveries to <HI>his</HI> advantage.</P>
<P>In &s;hort we &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly improve upon each other, that if we go on thus, we &s;hall hardly know our&s;elves to be the &s;ame man and woman, that made &s;uch aukward figures in the eyes of all beholders a few months ago at St. George's church; and mu&s;t be mar|ried over again, to be &s;ure of each other; for you mu&s;t believe, that we would not be the &s;ame odd &s;ouls we then were, on any account.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">
What rai&s;es him with me, is the good opinion every-body here has of him. <HI>They</HI> al&s;o have found him out to be a man of &s;en&s;e, a good-natur'd man, nay, would you believe it, a hand&s;ome man; and all the&s;e people having de&s;ervedly the reputation of good &s;en&s;e, penetration, and &s;o-forth, I cannot con|tradict them with credit to my&s;elf. When we mar|ried folks have made a &s;illy choice, we &s;hould in po|licy, you know, for the credit of our judgment, try to make the be&s;t of it. I could name you half a &s;core people who are continually prai&s;ing, the man his wife, the woman her hu&s;band, who, were they at liberty to choo&s;e again, would be hanged before they would renew their bargain.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, that Emily will make an excel|lent wife, and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family. Mi&s;s Byron is one of the be&s;t oeconomi&s;ts, and yet one of the fine&s;t La|dies, in the county. As &s;oon as &s;he came down, &s;he re&s;umed the family direction, in ea&s;e of her aunt; which was her province before &s;he came to London. I thought my&s;elf a tolerable manager: But &s;he has for ever &s;topt <HI>my</HI> mouth on this &s;ubject. Such a <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>orderline&s;s,</HI> if I may &s;o call it! One right thing is an introduction to another; and all is in &s;uch a method, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for the meane&s;t &s;er|vants to mi&s;take their duty. Such harmony, &s;uch ob|&s;ervance, yet &s;uch plea&s;ure in every countenance!&mdash;But &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o much ea&s;e, &s;o much dignity, and &s;o much conde&s;cen&s;ion, that &s;he is wor&s;hiped by all the &s;ervants; and it is ob&s;ervable, hardly ever was heard to direct twice the &s;ame thing to be done, or remembred.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants have generally time for them&s;elves, an hour or two in a day. Her orders are given over night; and as the family live in a genteel manner, they are never &s;urpri&s;ed, or put out of cour&s;e, by com|pany. The poor only have the le&s;s of the remnants, if vi&s;iters or gue&s;ts come in unexpectedly; and in
<PB N="114" REF="115">
&s;uch ca&s;e, &s;he &s;ays, they &s;hall fare better another day. Emily is taking minutes of all her management: She is re&s;olved to imitate her in every-thing. Hence it is, that I &s;ay, the girl will make one of the be&s;t wives in England: Yet, how the dear Harriet manages it, I cannot tell; for we hardly ever mi&s;s her. But early hours, and method, and ea&s;e, without hurry, will do every-thing.</P>

<P>Let us then con&s;ider a little the bright fairy &s;chemes, for &s;o I mu&s;t call them, which you have formed in the Letter that lies before me <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This Letter appears not.</NOTE>. Do not your excellent grandmamma and aunt &s;ee them in the &s;ame light? I dare &s;ay they do: But to one I love &s;o dearly, how can I omit to offer my hand to extricate her out of a maze of bewildering fancy, in which &s;he may el&s;e tread many a weary &s;tep, that ought to be advancing forward in the paths of happine&s;s and duty?</P>
<P>Think but, my dear child, what fortitude of &s;oul, what &s;trength even of con&s;titution, you an&s;wer for, when you talk of living happy in friend&s;hip with two per&s;ons, when they are united by indi&s;&s;oluble ties, the very thought of who&s;e union makes your cheek fade, and your health langui&s;h. Ah, my be|loved Harriet! is not this a fairy-&s;cheme?</P>
<P>Mi&s;take me not, my love; I &s;u&s;pect not that your &s;entiments would want any-thing of the purity, the genero&s;ity, the true heroi&s;m required in the idea of a friend&s;hip, like that you talk of. I &s;u&s;pect not in the <HI>noble pair</HI> [Does that phra&s;e hurt you, my Mi&s;s By|ron? Think then how your heart would &s;uffer in the la&s;ting conflict that mu&s;t accompany the &s;ituation which you have propo&s;ed to your&s;elf] I &s;u&s;pect not, in either of them, &s;entiments or behaviour un&s;uitable to your excellence: Yet let me a&s;k you one thing: Would not the example of &s;uch an attachment &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between per&s;ons known to have once had dif|ferent views, and tenderer affections, mi&s;lead le&s;s de|licate and le&s;s guarded minds into allowances danger|ous
<PB N="117" REF="118">
to them; and &s;ubject &s;ouls, le&s;s great than Cle|mentina, to jealou&s;ies, whether warrantable or not, of friend&s;hips that &s;hould plead yours for a pre&s;ident?</P>
<P>Do not be impatient, my dear; I have a great deal more to &s;ay. This <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> what is it to be? Not <HI>more</HI> than friend&s;hip, di&s;gui&s;ed under the name of it: For how can that con&s;i&s;t with your peace of mind, your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the dictates of rea&s;on, your re&s;ig|nation to the will of Providence? If then it be <HI>only</HI> friend&s;hip, how is it incon&s;i&s;tent with your forming an attachment of a <HI>nearer kind</HI> with a per&s;on of merit who approves of, and will join in it? What think you, my dear, is that Love which we vow at the altar? Surely, not adoration: Not a preference of that ob|ject <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> as in excellence &s;uperior to every other imaginable being. No more, &s;urely, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, than &s;uch a <HI>preferable choice</HI> (all circum&s;tances con|&s;idered) as &s;hall make us with &s;atisfaction of mind, and with an affectionate and faithful heart, unite our|&s;elves for life with a man whom we e&s;teem; who we think is no di&s;agreeable companion, but de&s;erves our grateful regard; that his intere&s;t from henceforth &s;hould be our own, and his happine&s;s our &s;tudy. And is not this very con&s;i&s;tent, my dear, with admiring and loving the excellence of angels; and even with &s;eeing and pitying, in this partner of our lives, &s;uch imperfections as make him evidently their inferior? Inferior even to &s;uch human angels, as you and I have in our heads at this moment.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, my dear, I &s;ay only that &s;uch friend&s;hip is very con&s;i&s;tent with being more nearly united to one who <HI>knows</HI> and <HI>approves</HI> it: For concealment of any thought, that much affects the heart, is, I think, in &s;uch a ca&s;e (with very few exceptions from very particular circum&s;tances) utterly unallowable, and blameably indelicate.</P>
<P>You are, my dear, I will not offend you, by &s;aying to what <HI>degree,</HI> a rea&s;onable and prudent young wo|man;
<PB N="118" REF="119">
pious, dutiful, and benevolent. Con&s;ider then, how much better you would account for the talents committed to you; how much more joy you would give to the be&s;t of friends; how much more good you would do to your fellow-creatures, by permitting your|&s;elf to be called out into active life, with all its variety of relations, than you can while you continue ob&s;ti|nately in a &s;ingle &s;tate, on purpo&s;e to indulge a reme|dile&s;s &s;orrow. The dome&s;tic connexions would engage you in a thou&s;and, not unplea&s;ing, new cares and at|tentions, that mu&s;t inevitably wear out, in time, im|pre&s;&s;ions which you would feel it unfit to indulge. All that is generous, grateful, rea&s;onable, in your very ju&s;t attachment, would remain? every-thing that pa&s;&s;ion and imagination have added, every unrea&s;onable, every painful emotion, would be bani&s;hed; and the friend|&s;hip between the two families become a &s;ource of la&s;t|ing happine&s;s to both.</P>
<P>Adieu, my Harriet! I am afraid of being tedious on an unplea&s;ing &s;ubject. If I have omitted any|thing material in this argument, the excellent parents you are with, can abundantly &s;upply it from their own rea&s;on, and experience of the world. A&s;&s;ure them of my unfeigned regard; and believe me, my dear child, with a degree of e&s;teem, that no young creature ever merited half &s;o well,</P>

<P>THANK you, my reverend and dear Mrs Shir|ley, Mrs. Selby, and Harriet the lovely and be|loved.
<PB N="121" REF="122">
Thank you, my dear Lucy and Nancy Selby, and Kitty and Patty Holles; and good Mi&s;s Orme; and you, my dear di&s;putatious uncle Selby, and hone&s;t cou&s;in James, and all the re&s;t of you; for your particular graces, favours, civilities, and goodne&s;s &s;uperabundant, to my bu&s;tling Lord, and his lively Dame. Let the good Doctor and Emily thank you for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And who do you think met us at St. Alban's?&mdash;Why, Beauchamp, Sir Harry and my Lady, and Mr. and Mrs. Reeves!</P>
<P>Poor Sir Harry! He is in a very bad way; and Lady Beauchamp and his &s;on (who peradventure had a rea&s;on he gave not) prevailed upon him to make this little excur&s;ion, in hopes it would divert him. They had not for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t &s;een him &s;o chear|ful as we made him.</P>
<P>Aunt Nell met us, at Barnet, with Cicely Badger, her &s;till older woman, whom &s;he keeps about her to make her&s;elf look young, on compari&s;on&mdash;But a piece of bad news, Harriet: Our aunt Nell has lo&s;t two more of her upper fore-teeth. A vile bit of bone (O how &s;he execrates it!) which lurked in a frica&s;ee, did the irreparable mi&s;chief: And the good old &s;oul is teaching her upper-lip, when &s;he &s;peaks, to re&s;ign all motion to the under one, that it may as little as po&s;|&s;ible make the defect vi&s;ible. What poor wretches are we, Harriet, men as <HI>well</HI> as women! We pray for long life; and what is the i&s;&s;ue of our prayers, but leave to outlive our teeth and our friends, to &s;tand in the way of our elbowing relations, and to change our &s;wan-&s;kins for &s;kins of buff; which neverthele&s;s will keep out neither cold nor infirmity? But I &s;hall be &s;erious by-and-by. And what is the de&s;ign of my <HI>pen-prattle,</HI> but to make my &s;weet Harriet &s;mile?</P>
<P>The Earl and Lady Gertrude made up differences with me at fir&s;t &s;ight. The Lady is a little upon the <HI>fallal;</HI> a little aunt <HI>Nelli&s;h;</HI> but I prote&s;t I love <HI>her,</HI> and reverence her <HI>brother.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">
Beauchamp is certainly in Love with Emily. When he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed her at St. Alban's, his hands trem|bled, his cheeks glowed, his tongue faltered&mdash;So young a gip&s;ey to make a conque&s;t of &s;uch impor|tance! We women are powerful creatures, Harriet. As they &s;ay of hor&s;es, If we knew our own &s;trength, and could have a little more patience than we gene|rally have, we might do what we would with the powerle&s;s Lords of the creation. In my con&s;cience, Harriet, look all <HI>my</HI> acquaintance through, of both Sexes, I think there are three &s;illy fellows to one &s;illy woman: Don't you think &s;o in <HI>yours?</HI>&mdash;Are your Grevilles, your Fenwicks, your Ormes, your Fow|lers, your Pollexfens, your Bagenhalls, and half a &s;core more I could name, to be put in competition with Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Lady D. our Lucy, Nancy, Mi&s;s Orme, the two Mi&s;s Holles's?&mdash;Let uncle Selby and cou&s;in James determine on the que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>I am half in hopes, that the little rogue Emily will draw her&s;elf in. Beauchamp is mode&s;t, yet not &s;heep|i&s;h; he is prudent, manly, lively; has addre&s;s: He will certainly draw her in, before &s;he knows where &s;he is: And how? Why by prai&s;ing &s;incerely, and loving cordially, the man at <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> mo&s;t dear to her. When he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed her at St. Alban's, O Mr. Beauchamp, &s;aid &s;he, with an innocent freedom, not regarding his tremblings, his glow, and his falterings, I am glad to &s;ee you: I long to have you entertain me with &s;tories of my guardian. But, ah! Sir, &s;peak|ing lower, and with a fallen countenance, tears ready to &s;tart, Who&s;e, who&s;e is he by this time? Yet, if you know it, don't tell me: It mu&s;t not, mu&s;t not be.</P>
<P>The prai&s;es given to tho&s;e we really love, I believe, are more grateful to us than tho&s;e conferred on our|&s;elves. I will tell you how I account for this, in ge|neral ca&s;es, my brother out of the que&s;tion.&mdash;We doubt not our <HI>own</HI> merits; but may be afraid, that
<PB N="123" REF="124">
the favoured object will not be con&s;idered by others as we are willing to con&s;ider him: But if he is, we take the prai&s;e given him as a compliment to our own judgment. Self-love, &s;elf-love, at the bottom of all we &s;ay and do: I am convinced it is, notwith&s;tand|ing all you have urged to the contrary. <HI>Generally,</HI> you know, I &s;aid. Do you think I will allow you to judge of the generality of the world by what you find in one of the be&s;t hearts in it?</P>
<P>An in&s;tance, in point&mdash;I remember a Mi&s;s Hur&s;te, a &s;weet pretty creature, and very &s;en&s;ible: She had from her chamber-window been &s;hot through the heart by the blind archer, who took his &s;tand on the feather of a military man marching at the head of his company through the market-town in which &s;he lived. Yet was her &s;u&s;ceptibility her only inducement; for the man was neither hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, nor gen|teel in his appearance: Nor could &s;he be in Love with the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of a man, had he been a Solomon, who&s;e mouth &s;he never &s;aw opened, and to who&s;e character &s;he was as much a &s;tranger, as he was to hers, or her per&s;on, till &s;he contrived to have him made acquainted with his good fortune. Con&s;tant, however, to her fir&s;t fooli&s;h impre&s;&s;ion, &s;he, in oppo&s;ition to all advice, and the expo&s;tulations of a tender and indulgent mo|ther, married him. A Solomon he was not. And when he at any time, by virtue of his relation to her, was introduced into her family, how would &s;he blu&s;h, whenever he opened his mouth! And how did her eyes &s;parkle with gratitude upon any one who took the lea&s;t re&s;pectful notice of him! Compliments to her&s;elf were unheeded; but &s;he &s;eemed ready to throw her&s;elf at the feet of tho&s;e who &s;miled upon, and di|rected them&s;elves to, her Captain. Poor girl! &s;he wanted to give credit to the <HI>motive</HI> by which &s;he had been acted.</P>
<P>Now, Harriet, I charge you, that you think not that this man's name was Ander&s;on. Somebody met
<PB N="124" REF="125">
with an e&s;cape! Yet now-and-then I blu&s;h for Some-body. Yet between this Some-body and Mi&s;s Hur&s;te's ca&s;es there was this difference&mdash;A father's appre|hended&mdash;<HI>Tyranny</HI>&mdash;(&s;hall I call it?) impre&s;&s;ing the one; a tindery fit the other. In the one a timely recovery; in the other, the fir&s;t folly deliberately con|firmed.</P>
<P>Dear, dear Harriet! let me make you &s;mile!&mdash;I prote&s;t, if you won't, I will talk of Lord D. and then I know you will frown.</P>
<P>The excellent Lady of that name has already been to welcome us to town. She ab&s;olutely dotes upon you; &s;o, &s;he &s;ays, does the young Earl. She prays day and night, &s;he tells me, that my brother may &s;oon come to England, his Italian bride in his hand. She expects every po&s;t to hear from Sir Arthur Bran|don; who has carried a Letter from her, and another from the Earl of N. recommending that promi&s;ing young gentleman to my brother's favour, on his vi&s;it|ing Italy. She hopes my brother will not take ami&s;s her freedom, at &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. If Sir Ar|thur &s;ends her &s;uch news as <HI>&s;he</HI> wi&s;hes, and <HI>we</HI> dread, to hear, away drives &s;he to Northampton&s;hire&mdash;And &s;hould &s;he, I don't know who will &s;cruple to wi&s;h her &s;ucce&s;s; for her young man ri&s;es every day in his cha|racter. My dear creature, you mu&s;t, you &s;hall, be in our row; and Lady D's la&s;t Letter to you is un|an&s;werable. Forgive me for touching upon this &s;ub|ject: But we have no hopes. You have nothing to fear; &s;ince you expect what the next mails will bring. And <HI>who</HI> of us, after all, have our fir&s;t Love? Aunt Nell would not have de&s;cended <HI>&s;ola</HI> into her greys, nor Cicely Badger neither, if they might have ob|tained the men of their choice&mdash;Poor aunt Nell! &s;he has been telling me (her taken off &s;pectacles in her fingers) of a di&s;appointment of this kind in her youth, with &s;uch woeful earne&s;tne&s;s, that it made me ready to cry for her. She lays it at the door of her brother,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
my poor father; and now will you wonder, that, to this hour, &s;he cannot &s;peak of him with patience?&mdash;Poor aunt Nell!</P>
<P>Well, but how do you, my Love? For Heaven's &s;ake, be well. Could I make you &s;peak out, could I make you complain, I &s;hould have &s;ome hope of you: But &s;o &s;orrowful when alone, as we plainly &s;ee, yet aiming to be &s;o chearful in company&mdash;O my dear! you mu&s;t be gluttonous of grief in your &s;olitary hours. But what tho' the man <HI>be</HI> Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; Is not the woman Harriet Byron?</P>
<P>Lady L. tells me, that Olivia behaved like a di&s;|tracted woman, when &s;he took leave of her on her &s;etting out to return to Italy. She &s;ometimes wept, &s;ometimes raved and threatned. Wretched woman! Surely &s;he will not attempt the life of the man &s;he &s;o ungovernably loves! <HI>Our</HI> ca&s;e, Harriet, is not &s;o hard as hers: But &s;he will &s;ooner get over her talk|ative, than you will your &s;ilent Love. When a per|&s;on can rave, the pa&s;&s;ion is not dangerous. If the head be &s;afe, pride and &s;uppo&s;ed &s;light will in time harden the heart of &s;uch a one; and her Love will be &s;wallowed up by re&s;entment.</P>
<P>You complimented me on my <HI>civility</HI> to my good man, all the time we were with you. Indeed I was <HI>very</HI> civil to him. It is now become a habit, and I verily think that it looks well in man and wife to be|have prettily to each other before company. I now-and-then, however, &s;it down with a full de&s;ign to make him look about him; but he is &s;o obliging, that I am con&s;trained, again&s;t my intention, to let the fit go off, without making him <HI>very</HI> &s;erious.</P>
<P>Am I conceited, Harriet? Which of the two &s;illy folks, do you think, has mo&s;t (Not wit&mdash;Wit is a fool|i&s;h thing, but) under&s;tanding? I <HI>think</HI> the woman has it, all to nothing.&mdash;Now don't mortify me. If you pretend to <HI>doubt,</HI> I will be <HI>&s;ure.</HI> Upon my word, my dear, I am an excellent creature, <HI>&s;o</HI> thinking, <HI>&s;o</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="127">
a&s;&s;ured, to behave &s;o obligingly as I do to Lord G. Never, never, unle&s;s a woman has as much prudence as your Charlette, let her wed a man who has le&s;s un|der&s;tanding than her&s;elf. But women marry not &s;o much now-a-days for Love, or fitne&s;s of tempers, as for the liberty of gadding abroad, with le&s;s cen&s;ure, and le&s;s controul&mdash;And yet, now I think of it, we need only to take a &s;urvey of the flocks of &s;ingle women which croud to Ranelagh and Vaux-hall markets, dre&s;&s;ed out to be <HI>cheapened,</HI> not <HI>purcha&s;ed,</HI> to be convinced that the maids are as much above either &s;hame or controul, as the wives.

As for <HI>mothers,</HI> many of them are for e&s;corting their daughters to public places, becau&s;e they them&s;elves like racketing.</P>
<P>But how, Charlotte, methinks you a&s;k, do the&s;e reflexions on your own Sex &s;quare with what you &s;aid above of the preference of women to men?&mdash;How! I'll tell you. The men who frequent tho&s;e places are &s;till more &s;illy than we. Is it their intere&s;t to join in this almo&s;t univer&s;al di&s;&s;ipation? And would the wo|men croud to market, if there were not men?</P>
<P>We are entered into our new hou&s;e. It is fur|ni&s;hed in ta&s;te. Lord G. has wanted but very little of my correction, I do a&s;&s;ure you, in the di&s;po&s;ition of every-thing: He begins to want employment.

My friends and I are one; and my uncle and <HI>cou&s;in James</HI> laughed out at &s;everal places in your lively Letter. Lucy, Nancy, &s;miled. My cou&s;ins Kitty and Patty Holles &s;aid, You were a charming Lady: But &s;hall I tell you what my grandmamma and aunt &s;aid?&mdash;I will not&mdash;Now will your curio&s;ity be excited&mdash;To &s;ay the truth, they &s;poke not; they only &s;hook their heads. I &s;aw, my dear, greatly as they love and admire you, that if they had &s;miled, it would have been <HI>at,</HI> not <HI>with,</HI> the poor Charlotte (Let me pity you, my dear!) who, in &s;ome places of her Letter, could &s;port with the infirmities of age, to which we are all advancing, and even wi&s;h to arrive at; and in others treat lightly a man, to whom &s;he owes re&s;pect, and has vowed duty; and who almo&s;t adores her.</P>
<P>You a&s;k, my dear, which of a certain pair has mo&s;t under&s;tanding? And you bid me not mortify you with giving it on the man's &s;ide. I will not.
<PB N="128" REF="129">
Lord G. is far from being wanting in under&s;tanding; but Lady G. has undoubtedly more than thou&s;ands, even of &s;en&s;ible women: But in her treatment of cer|tain &s;ubjects, &s;he by no means &s;hews it. There's for you, my dear! I hope you will be angry with your Harriet. You ought to take <HI>one</HI> of us to ta&s;k. Me|thinks I would not have you be angry with your&s;elf.</P>
<P>But, my dear, I am not well: This therefore may make me the le&s;s capable of reli&s;hing your raillery. The&s;e men vex me. Greville's ob&s;tinate per&s;everance, and &s;o near a neighbour, that I cannot avoid &s;eeing him often: Poor Mr. Orme's ill health: Another Letter from Sir Rowland Meredith, its contents &s;o extremely kind and generous, that they afflict me.&mdash;Lady D. urging me (I am afraid I mu&s;t &s;ay) with &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;on, and with an affection &s;o truly ma|ternal, that I know not how to an&s;wer her: And ju&s;t now I have received a Letter, unknown to that good Lady, from the Earl of D.&mdash;laying in a claim, on a certain &s;uppo&s;ition, that&mdash;O my dear! how cruel is all this to your Harriet! My grandmamma by her eyes, I &s;ee, wi&s;hes me to think of marriage, and with Lord D.&mdash;as all thoughts&mdash;I need not &s;ay of what, are over&mdash;My aunt Selby's eyes are ready to &s;econd my grandmamma's&mdash;My uncle &s;peaks out on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion: So do you: So does Lucy. Nancy is &s;ilent: She &s;ees my di&s;turbance when I am looked at, and talked to, on this &s;ubject: So ought Lucy, I think. Sir Rowland &s;ays, Mr. Fowler has almo&s;t pined him&s;elf to death.&mdash;My Soul, my dear, is fretted. I have begged leave to pa&s;s a fortnight or three weeks with my good Mr. Deane, who rejoiced at the motion; but my grandmother heard my re|que&s;t with tears: She could not &s;pare her Harriet, &s;he told me. My aunt al&s;o dried <HI>her</HI> eyes&mdash;How, my Charlotte, could I think of leaving them?&mdash;Yet could they have parted with me, I &s;hould &s;urely have been more compo&s;ed with Mr. Deane than at pre&s;ent
<PB N="129" REF="130">
I can be any-where el&s;e. He is more delicate (Shall I be excu&s;ed to &s;ay?) than my uncle.</P>
<P>Were but the news come that the &s;olemnity is over&mdash;I am greatly mi&s;taken in my&s;elf, if I &s;hould not be more ea&s;y than I am at pre&s;ent&mdash;But then I &s;hould be more teazed, more importuned, than before. You tell me, the Counte&s;s of D. would come down: The very thought of that vi&s;it hurts me.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but by this time the knot is tied. God Almighty &s;hower on the heads of both, the choice&s;t of his ble&s;&s;ings! I &s;hould be quite out of hu|mour with my&s;elf, if I were not able to offer up this prayer as often as I pray for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I beg of you, my dear, to &s;peed to me the next Letters from Italy, be the contents what they will. You know I am armed. Shall the event I wi&s;h to be over, either &s;urpri&s;e or grieve me; I hope not.</P>
<P>I will not pity Lady Olivia, becau&s;e &s;he threatned and raved. True Love rages not; threatens not. Yet a di&s;appointment in Love is a dreadful thing; and may operate, in different minds, different ways, as I have read &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>I &s;hall write to all my friends in town, and at Colne|brooke: I trouble you not, therefore, with particular compliments to them.</P>
<P>How could you mention the names of Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, and &s;ay no more of them? I thought you loved them both. They are de&s;erving of your love, and love you.</P>
<P>Never, I believe, did any young creature &s;uffer in her mind by &s;u&s;pen&s;e as I have done for &s;ome months pa&s;t. In the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things I know not what further to write. What <HI>can</HI> I, my Charlotte?&mdash;Conjectural topics are re&s;erved for my clo&s;et and pillow.</P>
<P>Adieu, and adieu, my beloved friend, my dear Lady G. Be good, and he happy! What a ble&s;&s;ing, that <HI>both</HI> are in your power! May they ever be
<PB N="130" REF="131">
&s;o! And may you make a good u&s;e of that power, prays</P>

<P>MY heart is unu&s;ually &s;ad. How imperfect is that happine&s;s which we cannot enjoy without giv|ing pain to another! The Count of Belvedere has been made acquainted with the hopeful turn in the mind of Clementina? and that, in all probability, &s;he will be given as a reward to the man to who&s;e friendly cares for her, and her brother, the whole family attri|bute the happy alteration: and late la&s;t night he gave me notice of his arrival in this city, and of his in|tention to pay me an early vi&s;it this morning.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now had a me&s;&s;age from Clementina by Camilla, with a reque&s;t, that I will &s;u&s;pend my in|tended vi&s;it till the afternoon.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked Camilla, If &s;he knew the rea&s;on of this; and of her being &s;o early di&s;patched with it? She &s;aid, It was her young Lady's own order, without con&s;ult|ing any-body. The Marchione&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, ye&s;terday in the afternoon, told her that every-thing was now ab&s;olutely determined upon between them and me and &s;he would be mi&s;tre&s;s of her own wi&s;hes; and that I &s;hould be allowed to attend her in the morning at breakfa&s;t, to know what tho&s;e were. Her young Lady, on this happy communication (&s;o Camilla called it) threw her&s;elf at her mother's feet, and in a very graceful manner acknowleged her father's and her indulgence to her; and from that hour her temper took a turn different from what it had been before. For, ever &s;ince, &s;aid Camilla, &s;he has been &s;ilent, &s;o|lemn, and re&s;erved; yet bu&s;y at her pen, tran&s;cribing
<PB N="131" REF="132">
fair from her pocket-book what &s;he had written in it. To-morrow, Camilla!&mdash;To-morrow! &s;aid &s;he break|ing once her &s;olemn &s;ilence, her complexion varying, will be a day indeed! O that it were come! and yet I dread it. How &s;hall I, face to face, conver&s;e with this exalted man! What &s;hall I do to appear as great as He? His goodne&s;s fires me with emulation!&mdash;O that to-morrow were come, and gone!</P>
<P>This was over night. I believe, proceeded Ca|milla, that the dear Lady is drawing up &s;ome condi|tions of her own for you to &s;ign: But Sir, I dare &s;ay, by the hint &s;he has thrown out, they will be generous ones, and what will have more of fancy than hard&s;hip in them.</P>
<P>I had much ado to prevail upon her, continued her faithful woman, to go to re&s;t at midnight: Yet at four in the morning &s;he aro&s;e, and went to her pen and ink; and about Six commanded me to call Laura to attend her, while I went to you with the me&s;&s;age I have brought. I expo&s;tulated with her, and begged &s;he would delay it till the Marchione&s;s aro&s;e; but &s;he began to be impatient: I have <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in my reque&s;t, Camilla, &s;aid &s;he. I mu&s;t not be contradicted, or ex|po&s;tulated with: My head will not bear oppo&s;ition, at this time. Is it a &s;light thing for &s;uch a poor creature as I have been, and am, to be put out of her cour&s;e; Am I not to have a meeting with the Chevalier Gran|di&s;on, on the mo&s;t important act of my life? My mamma tells me, that I am to be now mi&s;tre&s;s of my own will; Don't <HI>you,</HI> Camilla, &s;eek to controul me. I &s;hall not be prepared enough for the &s;ubject he will po&s;&s;ibly talk to me upon, till the afternoon: And if I know he is in the hou&s;e with an expectation of &s;eeing me, I &s;hall want the pre&s;ence of mind I am &s;truggling to obtain.</P>
<P>So, Sir, concluded Camilla, I have performed my duty. The dear Lady, I &s;ee, will be in too much confu&s;ion, if the important &s;ubject be not begun with
<PB N="132" REF="133">
precaution: But who &s;hall in&s;truct you in &s;uch delicate points as the&s;e? One thing, however, permit me, Sir, to ob&s;erve: I have often known young Ladies go on courageou&s;ly with a Lover, while the end in view has been di&s;tant, or there have been difficulties to encounter with; but when the&s;e difficulties are overcome, and they have a&s;cended the hill they toiled up, they have turned round, and looked about them, with fear as &s;trong as their hopes.</P>
<P>What the conditions may be&mdash;</P>
<P>But the Count of Belvedere is come.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ten o'clock.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Count acco&s;ted me, in return for the kinde&s;t reception I could give him, with an air of coldne&s;s and di&s;plea&s;ure. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at a behaviour &s;o different from his u&s;ual politene&s;s, and the kindne&s;s he had ever &s;hewn me. I took notice to him of it. He a&s;ked me, If I would tell him faithfully what my pre&s;ent &s;ituation was with Lady Clementina?</P>
<P>I will, my Lord, if I tell you any-thing of it: But the temper of mind you &s;eem to be in, may not, perhaps, for your own &s;ake, any more than mine, make it prudent for me to comply with your expecta|tions.</P>
<P>You need not give me any other an&s;wer, replied he. You &s;eem to be &s;ure of the Lady: But &s;he mu&s;t not, &s;he <HI>&s;hall</HI> not, be yours, while I am living.</P>
<P>It is not for me, my Lord, who have met with many amazing turns and incidents which I have not either invited or provoked, to be &s;urpri&s;ed at <HI>any</HI>-thing: But if your Lord&s;hip has any expectations, any demands, to make on this &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be from the family of the Marche&s;e della Porretta, and not from me.</P>
<P>Do you think, Sir, that I feel not the &s;ting of this reference? And yet all the family, but one, are in my intere&s;t in their hearts; every con&s;ideration is on my &s;ide; not one, but the plau&s;ibility of your genero&s;ity,
<PB N="133" REF="134">
and the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of your per&s;on and manners, on yours.</P>
<P>A man, my Lord, &s;hould not be reproached for qualities, upon which, whether he has them or not, he values not him&s;elf. But, let me a&s;k you, Were my preten&s;ions out of the que&s;tion, has your Lord|&s;hip any hope of an intere&s;t in the affections of La|dy Clementina.</P>
<P>While &s;he is unmarried, I <HI>may</HI> hope. Had you not come over to us, I make no doubt but I might in time, have called her mine. You cannot but know, that her ab&s;ence of mind was no ob&s;tacle with me.</P>
<P>I am wholly &s;atisfied in my own conduct, replied I: That, my Lord, is a great point with me: I am not accountable for it to any man on earth. Yet, if you have any doubts about it, propo&s;e them. I have a high opinion of the Count of Belvedere, and wi&s;h to have him think well of me.</P>
<P>Tell me, Chevalier, what your pre&s;ent &s;ituation is with Lady Clementina? What is concluded upon be|tween the family and you? And whether Clementina her&s;elf has declared for you?</P>
<P>She has not yet declared her&s;elf <HI>to me.</HI> I repeat, that I have a value for the Count of Belvedere, and will therefore acquaint him with more than he has rea&s;on to expect from the humour which &s;eems to have governed him in this vi&s;it.&mdash;I am to attend her this afternoon, by appointment: Her family and I under&s;tand one another. I have been willing to con|&s;ider the natural impul&s;es of a &s;pirit &s;o pure, tho' di&s;turbed, as the finger of Providence. I have hi|therto been ab&s;olutely pa&s;&s;ive: In honour I cannot now be &s;o. This afternoon, my Lord&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This afternoon,'</Q> trembling; What! this after|noon!&mdash;</P>
<P>Will my de&s;tiny, as to Lady Clementina, be deter|mined.</P>
<P>I am di&s;tracted. If her <HI>friends</HI> are determined in
<PB N="134" REF="135">
your favour, it is from nece&s;&s;ity, rather than choice: But if the Lady is left to <HI>her own</HI> determination, I am a lo&s;t man.</P>
<P>You have given a rea&s;on, my Lord, for your ac|quie&s;cence, <HI>&s;hould</HI> Lady Clementina determine in my favour&mdash;But it cannot be a happy circum&s;tance for me, if, as you hint, I am to enter into the family of Porretta as an unwelcome relation to any of them; and &s;till le&s;s, if my good fortune &s;hall make a man, ju&s;tly valued by all who know him, unhappy.</P>
<P>And are you, this afternoon, Chevalier, to &s;ee Cle|mentina for the purpo&s;e you intimate? This <HI>very</HI> afternoon?&mdash;And are you then to change your pa&s;&s;ive conduct towards her? And will you court, will you urge her to con&s;ent to be yours? Religion, Country&mdash;Let me tell you, Sir,&mdash;I mu&s;t take re&s;olutions. With infinite regret I tell you, that I mu&s;t. You will not refu&s;e to meet me. The con&s;ent is not <HI>yet</HI> given: You &s;hall not rob Italy of &s;uch a prize. Favour me, Sir, this moment, without the city-gates.</P>
<P>Unhappy man! How much I pity you! You know my principles. It is hard, acting as I have done, to be thus invited. Acquaint your&s;elf with my whole conduct in this affair, from the Bi&s;hop, from Father Mare&s;cotti, from the General him&s;elf, &s;o much always your friend, and once &s;o little mine. What has in|fluenced them (&s;o much as you &s;eem to think again&s;t their inclinations) cannot want its influence upon a mind &s;o noble as that of the Count of Belvedere. But whatever be your re&s;olutions upon the enquiries I wi&s;h you to make, I tell you before-hand, that I never will meet you but as my friend.</P>
<P>He turned from me with emotion: He walked about the room as a man irre&s;olute; and at la&s;t, with a wild|ne&s;s in his air, approached me.&mdash;I will go this in&s;tant, &s;aid he, to the family: I will &s;ee Father Mare&s;cotti, and the Bi&s;hop; and I will let them know my de&s;pair, And if I cannot have hope given me.&mdash;O Chevalier!
<PB N="135" REF="136">
once more I &s;ay, that Lady Clementina &s;hall not be yours while I live.</P>
<P>He looked round him, as if he would not have any|body hear what he was going to &s;ay, but me, tho' no one was near; and whi&s;pering, It is better, &s;aid he, to die by your hand, than&mdash;He &s;topt; and in di&s;order hurried from me; and was out of &s;ight when I got down to the door.</P>
<P>The Count, when he came up to me, left his valet below; who told Saunders that Lady Sforza had made his Lord a <HI>vi&s;it</HI> at Parma; and by &s;omething &s;he related to him, had &s;timulated him to make <HI>this</HI> to me. He added, that he was very apprehen&s;ive of the hu|mour he came in, and which he had held ever &s;ince he &s;aw Lady Sforza.</P>
<P>How, my dear Dr. Bartlett, do the <HI>ra&s;h</HI> e&s;cape as they do; when I who endeavour to avoid embar|ra&s;&s;ments, and am not ready either to give or take offence, am hardly able to extricate my&s;elf from one difficulty, but I find my&s;elf involved in another? What cannot a woman do, when &s;he re&s;olves to make mi&s;chief among friends? Lady Sforza is a high|&s;pirited and contriving woman. It is not for her in|tere&s;t that Clementina &s;hould marry at all: But yet, as the Count of Belvedere is a cool, a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate man, and knows the views of that Lady, I cannot but wonder what tho&s;e arts mu&s;t be, by which &s;he has been able to excite, in &s;o calm a brea&s;t, a flame &s;o vehement.</P>
<P>I am now ha&s;tening to the palace of Porretta; my heart not a little affected with the apprehen&s;ions, given me by Camilla's account of her young Lady's &s;olemn, yet active turn, on the expected vi&s;it. For does it not indicate an imagination too much rai&s;ed for the occa|&s;ion (important as that is); and that her di&s;order is far from &s;ub&s;iding?</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXIV.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Sat. Evening.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Sit down, now, my dear and reverend friend, to write to you particulars which will &s;urpri&s;e you! Clementina is the noble&s;t woman on earth! What at la&s;t&mdash;But I find I mu&s;t have a quieter heart, and fin|gers too, before I can proceed.</P>
<P>I THINK I am a little le&s;s agitated than I was. The above few lines &s;hall go; for they will expre&s;s to you the emotions of my mind, when I attempted to write an account of what had then &s;o newly pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I entered the palace, Camilla met me, and conducted me to the Marchione&s;s. The Marquis and the Bi&s;hop were with her. O Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, we have been greatly di&s;turbed by a vi&s;it from the Count of Belvedere. Poor man!&mdash;He &s;ays he waited on you at your lodgings.</P>
<P>He did. I then, at the Bi&s;hop's reque&s;t, told them all that had pa&s;&s;ed between us, except his la&s;t words, which implied, that it was better to die by the hand of another man, than by his own.</P>
<P>They expre&s;&s;ed their concern for him, and their apprehen&s;ions for me; but I found that his unexpected vi&s;it had not altered their purpo&s;e in my favour. They were convinced, they told him, that the re&s;toration of their daughter's tranquillity of mind depended upon giving her entirely her own way; and not one word more of oppo&s;ition or contradiction &s;hould &s;he meet with from them.</P>
<P>I have been hindered, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, by this unhappy man's vi&s;it, and his vehemence, which moved me to pity him (for I am afraid that he will be in our daughter's unhappy way) from watching in
<PB N="137" REF="138">
per&s;on the humour of my child; which, two hours ago, Camilla told me, was very particular. I was going to her, when you came; but I will &s;end for Camilla.&mdash;She did.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me in the morning, continued the Marchione&s;s, &s;he apologized to me for &s;ending Camilla to you to &s;u&s;pend your vi&s;it till the afternoon. She was not, &s;he &s;aid, prepared to &s;ee you.&mdash;I a&s;ked her, continued &s;he, What preparation was wanted to &s;ee a man e&s;teemed by us all, and who had given &s;uch in&s;tances of his regard to her?</P>
<P>Madam, an&s;wered &s;he, and &s;eemed as if ga&s;ping for breath, Am I not now to &s;ee him in a light, in which hitherto I never beheld him? I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to him, none of which perhaps I &s;hall be able to &s;ay, except he draws them from me. He hinted once, very lately, that he could only be re|warded by a <HI>family act.</HI> We <HI>cannot</HI> reward him; that is my grief: I mu&s;t &s;ee him with a heart overwhelmed with obligation. He will appear as a prince to me: I mu&s;t to my&s;elf as his va&s;&s;al. I have been putting down, in writing, what I &s;hould &s;ay to him; but I cannot plea&s;e my&s;elf. O madam! he is great in my eyes, becau&s;e I am unable to reward him as he de|&s;erves. I told her, that her fortune, her quality, the &s;acrifice &s;he would make of her Country (tho' never, I hoped, of her Religion) ought to give her a higher opinion of her&s;elf; tho' all the&s;e were far from can|celling the obligation we all were under to him, on our Jeronymo's account, as well as on hers.</P>
<P>Well, madam, replied &s;he, Heaven only knows how I &s;hall be able to behave to him, now you have left every thing to my&s;elf; and how he will talk to me, by permi&s;&s;ion, on a &s;ubject &s;o new, yet &s;o very intere&s;ting. O that this day were over!</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her, proceeded the Marchione&s;s, if &s;he would yet take further time?&mdash;A week, or more?</P>
<P>O no, &s;aid &s;he: That mu&s;t not be. I &s;hall be
<PB N="138" REF="139">
prepared to &s;ee him, I hope, by the afternoon. Pray let him come then. I am very clear now, putting her hand to her forehead: I may not be &s;o a week, nor a day hence.</P>
<P>Camilla then entered the room. Camilla. &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, In what way is the dear creature now?</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince your Lady&s;hip left her, &s;he has been more re&s;erved, and thoughtful; yet her &s;pirits are high: Her mind &s;eems full of the Chevalier's next vi&s;it; and twice, within this half-hour, &s;he a&s;ked if he were come? She reads over and over, &s;omething &s;he has written; lays it down, takes it up; walks about the room, &s;ometimes with an air of dignity, at others hanging down her head. I don't like her fre|quent &s;tartings. Within this hour &s;he has &s;everal times &s;hed tears. She &s;ighs often. She was not to be plea&s;ed with her dre&s;s. Once &s;he would be in black; then in colours; then her white and &s;ilver was taken out: But that, &s;he &s;aid, would give her a bridal ap|pearance: She at la&s;t cho&s;e her plain white &s;atten. She looks like an Angel. But O that her eyes, and her motions, &s;hewed greater compo&s;ure!</P>
<P>You have a ta&s;k before you, Chevalier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. What tokens are the&s;e of a di&s;ordered, yet a rai&s;ed mind! We may &s;ee, from the&s;e extraordinary agitations, on the expectation of a conver&s;ation that is to end in her con&s;ent to crown your wi&s;hes, how much her heart has been in that event: May it be happy to you both!</P>
<P>I fear nothing, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, as to the hap|pine&s;s of my child, that lies within the power of the Chevalier: I am &s;ure of his tenderne&s;s to her.</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid the Marquis, we will allow the Che|valier to carry his bride over to England for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;ix months, and return with her to us in the <HI>&s;econd:</HI> It may give a new turn to the cour&s;e of her ideas. The &s;ame places, the &s;ame per&s;ons, always in view, may &s;adden her reflecting heart. And, be&s;ides, the
<PB N="139" REF="140">
mind of the poor Count of Belvedere may be &s;trength|ened by this ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop applauded this thought. The Mar|chione&s;s &s;aid, <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> may approve the motion; but can the <HI>mother</HI> &s;o &s;oon part with her child?&mdash;Yet for her happine&s;s, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Let us, &s;aid the Marquis, leave this to her choice, as the re&s;t. Camilla, let my daughter know, that the Chevalier attends her plea&s;ure. You would have it &s;o, Chevalier?</P>
<P>I bowed my a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Camilla returned not pre&s;ently: When &s;he did; I could not come &s;ooner, &s;aid &s;he. My young Lady is &s;trangely fluttered. I have been rea&s;oning with her.&mdash;Madam, turning to the Marchione&s;s, Will you be plea&s;ed to walk up to her?</P>
<P>Had this been the fir&s;t interview, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, I &s;hould not have wondered at her di&s;compo&s;ure: But this di&s;order &s;hews it&s;elf in a &s;trange variety of &s;hapes!</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, attended by Camilla, went up. I was &s;oon &s;ent for. The Marchione&s;s met me at the entrance of the young Lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room&mdash;and re|tiring, whi&s;pered&mdash;I believe &s;he had rather be alone with you. Dear creature! I don't know what to make of her. She has, I fan&s;y, &s;omething to propo&s;e to you. Camilla, come with me. We will be but in the next room, Chevalier.</P>
<P>When I entered the room, the young Lady was &s;it|ting in a pen&s;ive mood, at her toilette; her hand &s;up|porting her head. A fine glow over&s;pread her cheeks, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me: She aro&s;e, and, courte&s;ying low, advanced a few &s;teps towards me; but trembled, and looked now down, now a&s;ide, and now con&s;ciou&s;ly glancing towards me.</P>
<P>I approached her, and, with profound re&s;pect, took her hand with both mine, and pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips. I addre&s;s not my&s;elf now to Lady Clementina as my
<PB N="140" REF="141">
pupil: I have leave given me to look upon her in a nearer light; and &s;he will have the goodne&s;s to par|don the freedom of this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, turning her face from me, but not withdrawing her hand&mdash;And he&s;itating, as if not knowing how to &s;peak her mind, &s;ighed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I led her to her chair. She &s;at down, &s;till trem|bling. God be prai&s;ed, &s;aid I, bowing my face on both her hands, as I held them in mine, for the amended health of the Lady &s;o dear to all who have the happine&s;s of knowing her! May her recovery, and that of our dear Jeronymo, be perfected!</P>
<P>Happy man! &s;aid &s;he, happy in the power given you to oblige as you have done!&mdash;But how, how &s;hall I&mdash;O, Sir! you know not the conflict that has rent my heart in pieces, ever &s;ince&mdash;I forget when.&mdash;O Chevalier! I have not power&mdash;She &s;topt, wept, and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It is in your power, madam, to make happy the man to whom you own obligations which are already overpaid.</P>
<P>I took my &s;eat by her, at her &s;ilent motion to a chair.</P>
<P>Speak on, Sir: My Soul is labouring with great purpo&s;es. Tell me, tell me, all you have to &s;ay to me. My heart is too big for its pri&s;on, putting her hand to it: It wants room, methinks; yet utterance is denied me&mdash;Speak, and let me be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Your Father, Mother, Brothers, Uncle, are all of one mind. I am permitted to open my heart to their Clementina; and I promi&s;e my&s;elf a gracious audi|ence. Father Mare&s;cotti befriends me.&mdash;The terms, madam, are tho&s;e I offered when I was la&s;t in Italy.</P>
<P>She hung down her head, in li&s;tening &s;ilence&mdash;</P>
<P>Every other year I am to be happy with my Clemen|tina in England&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> Clementina, Sir!&mdash;Ah Chevalier!&mdash;She

blu&s;hed, and turned away her face&mdash;<HI>Your</HI> Clementina, Sir! repeated &s;he&mdash;and looked plea&s;ed; yet a tear &s;tole down on her glowing cheek.</P>
<P>Yes, madam, I am encouraged to hope you will be mine.&mdash;You are to have your confe&s;&s;or, madam, Father Mare&s;cotti will do me the honour of attending you in that function. His piety, his zeal, my own charity for all tho&s;e who differ from me in opinion, my honour &s;o &s;olemnly engaged to the family who conde&s;cend to entru&s;t me with their deare&s;t pledge, will be your &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! interrupted &s;he, And are not you then to be a Catholic?</P>
<P>You <HI>con&s;ented,</HI> madam, when I was la&s;t in Italy, that I &s;hould pur&s;ue the dictates of my con&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>Did</HI> I? &s;aid &s;he, and &s;ighed!&mdash;Well, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Your father or mother, madam, will acquaint you with every other particular in which you &s;hall want to be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Tears &s;tood in her eyes; &s;he &s;eemed in great per|plexity. She would twice or thrice have &s;poken; but &s;peech was denied her: At la&s;t, &s;he gave me her hand, and directed her &s;teps, trembling, to her clo&s;et. She entered it. Leave me, leave me, &s;aid &s;he; and put|ting a paper in my hand, and &s;hutting to the door, in&s;tantly, as I &s;aw, fell on her knees; and I, to avoid hearing &s;obs which pierced my heart, went into the next apartment, where were her mother and Camilla, who had heard part of what had pa&s;&s;ed between us. The Marchione&s;s went to her; but pre&s;ently return|ing, The dear creature, &s;aid &s;he, is quite &s;en&s;ible, thank God, tho' in grief. She be&s;ought me to leave her to her own &s;truggles. If &s;he could but be a&s;&s;ured that you, Chevalier, would forgive her, &s;he &s;hould be better. She had given you a paper. Let him read it, &s;aid &s;he; and let me &s;tay here till he &s;ends for me, if he can bear in his &s;ight, <HI>after</HI> he has read it, a creature unworthy of his goodne&s;s.&mdash;What, &s;aid the Mar|chione&s;s, can be the meaning of all this?</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">
I was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as &s;he.

<LETTER>
<P>O Thou whom my heart be&s;t loveth, forgive me!&mdash;Forgive me, &s;aid I, for what?&mdash;For acting, if I am enabled to act, greatly? The example is from thee, who, in my eyes, art the greate&s;t of human creatures. My duty calls upon me one way: My heart re&s;i&s;ts my duty, and tempts me not to perform it: Do thou, O God, &s;upport me in the arduous &s;truggle! Let it not, as once before, overthrow my rea&s;on; my but ju&s;t-returning rea&s;on!&mdash;O God! do thou &s;upport me, and &s;trengthen my rea&s;on. My effort is great! It is worthy of the creature, which thou, Clementina, did&s;t always a&s;pire to be.</P>
<P>My Tutor, my Brother, my Friend! O mo&s;t be|loved and be&s;t of men! &s;eek me not in marriage! I am unworthy of Thee. Thy SOUL was ever mo&s;t dear to Clementina: Whenever I meditated the grace|fulne&s;s of thy per&s;on, I re&s;trained my eye, I checked my fancy: And how? Why, by meditating the &s;upe|rior graces of thy mind. And is not that SOUL, thought I, to be &s;aved? Dear ob&s;tinate, and perver&s;e! And &s;hall I bind my Soul to a Soul allied to perdition? That &s;o dearly loves that Soul, as hardly to wi&s;h to be &s;eparated from it in its future lot.&mdash;O thou mo&s;t amiable of men! How can I be &s;ure, that, were I thine, thou would&s;t not draw me after thee, by Love, by &s;weetne&s;s of Manners, by conde&s;cending Good|ne&s;s? I, who once thought a Heretic the wor&s;t of be|ings, have been already led, by the amiablene&s;s of thy piety, by the univer&s;ality of thy charity to all thy
<PB N="143" REF="144">
fellow-creatures, to think more favourably of all He|retics, for thy &s;ake? Of what force would be the ad|monitions of the mo&s;t pious Confe&s;&s;or, were thy con|de&s;cending goodne&s;s, and &s;weet per&s;ua&s;ion, to be ex|erted to melt a heart wholly thine! I know that I &s;hould not forbear arguing with thee, in hopes to con|vince thee: Yet, &s;en&s;ible of thy &s;uperior powers, and of my duty, might I not be entangled? My Confe&s;&s;or would, in that ca&s;e, grow unea&s;y with me. Women love not to be &s;u&s;pected. Oppo&s;ition ari&s;es from &s;u&s;|picion and contradiction; thy Love, thy Gentlene&s;s, thrown in the other &s;cale, &s;hould I not be lo&s;t?</P>
<P>And what have my Father, my Mother, my Bro|thers done, that I &s;hould &s;hew my&s;elf willing to leave them, and a beloved Country, for a Country but lately hated too, as well as the Religion? But now, that that hatred is gone off, and &s;o &s;oon, gives another in|&s;tance of my weakne&s;s, and thy &s;trength, O mo&s;t amiable of men!&mdash;O thou, whom my Soul loveth, &s;eek not to entangle me by thy Love! Were I to be thine, my duty to thee would mi&s;lead me from that I owe to my God, and make me more than tempora|rily unhappy: Since wert thou to convince me at the <HI>time,</HI> my doubts would return; and whenever thou wert ab&s;ent, I &s;hould be doubly mi&s;erable. For can&s;t Thou, can I, be indifferent in the&s;e high matters? Ha&s;t thou not &s;hewn me, that <HI>thou</HI> can&s;t not? And &s;hall I not be benefited by thy example? Shall a wrong Religion have a force, an efficacy, upon <HI>thee,</HI> which a right one cannot have upon <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;O thou mo&s;t amiable of men! &s;eek not to entangle me by thy Love!</P>
<P>But do&s;t thou <HI>indeed</HI> love me? Or is it owing to thy genero&s;ity, thy compa&s;&s;ion, thy noblene&s;s, for a creature, who, aiming to be great like thee, could not &s;u&s;tain the effort? I call upon thee, ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, to witne&s;s, how I <HI>formerly</HI> &s;truggled with my&s;elf! How much I endeavoured to &s;ubdue that affection which I
<PB N="144" REF="145">
ever mu&s;t bear to him!&mdash;<HI>Permit</HI> me, mo&s;t generous of men, to &s;ubdue it! It is in thy p wer to hold me fa&s;t, or to &s;et me free. I know thou love&s;t Clemen|tina: It is her pride to think that thou do&s;t. But &s;he is not worthy of thee. Yet let thy heart own, that thou love&s;t her Soul, her immortal Soul, and her fu|ture peace. In <HI>that</HI> wilt thou &s;hew thy Love, as &s;he has endeavoured to &s;hew hers. <HI>Thou</HI> art all magna|nimity: <HI>Thou</HI> can&s;t &s;u&s;tain the effort which <HI>&s;he</HI> was unequal to. Make &s;ome other woman happy!&mdash;But I cannot bear that it &s;hall be an Italian. If it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be an Italian, not Florence, but Bologna, &s;hall give an Italian to thee!</P>
<P>But can I &s;hew thee this paper, which has co&s;t me &s;o many tears, &s;o much &s;tudy, &s;o much blotting-out, and revi&s;ing and tran&s;cribing, and which yet I drew up with an <HI>intent</HI> to &s;hew thee? I verily think I can|not: Nor <HI>will</HI> I, till I can &s;ee, by conver&s;ing with thee face to face, what I &s;hall be enabled to do, in an&s;wer to prayers to Heaven, that it <HI>would</HI> enable me!&mdash;O how faint, at times, have been tho&s;e pray|ers!</P>
<P>You, my Father, my Mother, my Brothers, and you my &s;piritual Father, pious and good man! have helped to &s;ubdue me, by your generous goodne&s;s. You have all yielded up your own judgments to mine. You have told me, that if the choice of my heart can make me happy, happy I &s;hall be. But do I not know, that you have complied with me, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake only?&mdash;Shall I not, if it plea&s;e God to re&s;tore my memory, be continually recollecting the arguments which you, Father Mare&s;cotti, in particular, formerly urged again&s;t an alliance with this noble&s;t of men, becau&s;e he was of a religion &s;o contrary to my own, and &s;o pertinacious in it? And will tho&s;e <HI>recollections</HI> make me happy? O permit, permit me, my deare&s;t friends, &s;till to be God's child, the &s;pou&s;e of my Re|deemer only! Let me, let me yet take the veil!&mdash;
<PB N="145" REF="146">
And let me, in a place con&s;ecrated to his glory, pa&s;s the remainder of my life (It may not be a long one) in prayers for you all, and in prayers for the conver|&s;ion and happine&s;s of the man, who&s;e &s;oul my &s;oul loveth, and ever mu&s;t love. What is the portion of this world, which my grandfathers have bequeathed to me, weighed again&s;t this motive, and my &s;oul's ever|la&s;ting welfare? Let me take a great revenge of my cruel cou&s;in Laurana. Let hers be the e&s;tate &s;o truly de|&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;o voluntarily forfeited, by the happier Cle|mentina!&mdash;Are we not all of us rich and noble? Shall I not have a great revenge, if I can be enabled to take it in this way?</P>
<P>O thou whom my &s;oul loveth, let me try the great|ne&s;s of thy love, and the greatne&s;s of thy &s;oul, by thy endeavours to &s;trengthen, and not impair, a re&s;o|lution, which, after all, it will be in thy power to make me break or keep: For God only knoweth what this &s;truggle from the fir&s;t hath co&s;t me; and what it will &s;till further co&s;t me!

<P>But, O my friends, what can we do for this great and good man, in return for the obligations he hath heaped upon us all? In return for his goodne&s;s to two of your children? The&s;e obligations lie heavy upon my heart. Yet who knows not <HI>his</HI> magnanimity? Who, that knows him, knows not that he can enjoy the reward in the action? Divine, <HI>almo&s;t</HI> divine, Phi|lanthropi&s;t, can&s;t thou forgive me?&mdash;But I know thou can&s;t.

<P>Never was man more a&s;toni&s;hed, perplexed, con|founded. For a few moments, I forgot that the an|gel was in her clo&s;et, expecting the i&s;&s;ue of my con|templations; and walking out of her dre&s;&s;ing-room, I threw my&s;elf on a &s;offa, in the next room, not heeding Camilla, who &s;at in the window. My mind tortured; how greatly tortured! Yet filled with ad|miration of the angelic qualities of Clementina, I tried to look again into the paper; but the contents were all in my mind, and filled it.</P>
<P>She rang. Camilla ha&s;tened to her. I &s;tarted as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me. I aro&s;e; yet trembled: And for a moment &s;at down to re-a&s;&s;ure my feet. But Camilla, coming to me, rou&s;ed me out of the &s;tupidity that had &s;eized me. Never was I &s;o little pre&s;ent to my|&s;elf, as on this occa&s;ion&mdash;A woman &s;o &s;uperior to all her own Sex, and to all that I had read of, of ours.&mdash;O Sir, &s;aid Camilla, my Lady dreads your anger.

How &s;he fears your di&s;plea&s;ure!&mdash;Hers indeed is <HI>true</HI> Love!</P>
<P>She &s;aid this as &s;he conducted me in, as I now re|collect; for then all my faculties were too much en|gaged, to attend to her.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
I ha&s;tened in. The admirable Lady met me half|way? and throwing her&s;elf at my feet&mdash;Forgive me, forgive the creature, who mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, if you are offended with her.</P>
<P>I would have rai&s;ed her but &s;he would not be rai&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, till I had forgiven her.</P>
<P>I kneeled to her, as &s;he kneeled; and cla&s;ping her in my arms, Forgive you, madam! Inimitable wo|man! More than woman!&mdash;Can you forgive me for having pre&s;umed, or for &s;till per&s;uming, to hope &s;uch an angel mine!</P>
<P>She was ready to faint; and ca&s;t her arms about me to &s;upport her&s;elf. Camilla held to her her &s;alts:&mdash;I my&s;elf, for the fir&s;t time, was &s;en&s;ible of benefit from them, as my cheek was joined to hers, and bathed with her tears.</P>
<P>Am I, am I, forgiven&mdash;Say that I am!&mdash;</P>
<P>Forgive! madam! You have done nothing that requires forgivene&s;s. I adore your greatne&s;s of mind!&mdash;What you wi&s;h, bid me be, and that I <HI>will</HI> be. Ri&s;e, mo&s;t excellent of human creatures!</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed her; and leading her to a chair, involun|tarily kneeled on one knee to her, holding both her hands in mine as &s;he &s;at; and looking up to her with eyes that &s;poke not my heart, if they were not full of love and reverence.</P>

Pardon me, madam, an&s;wered Clementina&mdash;I could not &s;hew it to you fir&s;t. I could not reveal my purpo&s;e to Camilla neither. How could I, when I knew not whether I could or could not maintain it, or even mention it?&mdash;But now, be&s;t of men, and, ri&s;ing, laid her hand on my arm, leave me for a few moments.

<P>Hu&s;h, my Jeronymo! Let not the friend forget the brother. Clementina is the noble&s;t of women. It is true, I was not prepared for this blow. But I reverence her for her greatne&s;s of mind&mdash;You have read her paper?</P>
<P>I have; and am a&s;toni&s;hed at its contents.</P>
<P>The Marquis, the Count, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, entered. The Bi&s;hop embraced me.

<P>I withdrew, and walked again into the garden.</P>
<P>Camilla came to me. O Chevalier! What &s;trange things are the&s;e? My Lady has taken a re&s;olution &s;he never will be able to &s;upport. She commanded me to find you out, and to watch your looks, your behavi|our, your temper. She cannot live, &s;he &s;ays, if you are di&s;plea&s;ed with her&mdash;I &s;ee that your mind is great|ly di&s;turbed. Mu&s;t I report it &s;o?</P>
<P>Tell her, Camilla, that I am all re&s;ignation to her will: Di&s;turbed as &s;he has been, tell her, that her peace of mind is dear to me as my own life: That I <HI>can</HI> have no anger, no re&s;entment; and that I admire her more than I can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Camilla left me. Father Mare&s;cotti came to me pre&s;ently after, with a reque&s;t, that I would attend the family in Jeronymo's chamber.</P>
<P>We went up together. All that the good Father &s;aid, as we walked in, was, that God knew what was be&s;t for us: For <HI>his</HI> part, he could only wonder and adore in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>When we were all &s;eated, the Bi&s;hop &s;aid, My dear Chevalier, you have intitled your&s;elf to our ut|mo&s;t gratitude. It is confirmed, that Clementina &s;hall be yours. Jeronymo will have it &s;o: We are all of his mind. Her mother will enter into conver&s;ation with her in your favour.</P>
<P>I am equally obliged and honoured by this good|ne&s;s. But &s;hould &s;he per&s;i&s;t, what can I &s;ay, when &s;he calls upon me in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to &s;upport her in her re&s;olution; and not to put her upon taking advantage of the genero&s;ity of her friends?</P>
<P>She will be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, no doubt, Chevalier, an&s;wered the Bi&s;hop. She loves you. Does &s;he not &s;ay in this very paper, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it is in your power to
<PB N="151" REF="152">
make her break or keep her re&s;olution? and to add what name you plea&s;e to her Chri&s;tian name?"</Q></P>
<P>Nor can I, &s;aid the Marquis, bear that flight, in Laurana's favour. If her mind were found, her duty would not permit her to think of it.</P>
<P>It is our unanimous opinion, re&s;umed the Bi&s;hop, that &s;he will not be able to &s;upport her re&s;olution. You &s;ee &s;he is obliged to court your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to en|able her to keep it. Father Mare&s;cotti, it is true, has laid a &s;tre&s;s upon &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, in which &s;he &s;hews a doubt of her own &s;trength, and dreads yours in a certain article neare&s;t our hearts: But &s;he mu&s;t be cautioned to leave all arguments of that kind to her confe&s;&s;or and you; and to content her&s;elf to be an auditor, not an arguer; and we doubt not your honour. The marriage-articles will bind you, as they &s;hall us&mdash;And now allow me to be before-hand with your Jeronymo, and ours, in &s;aluting you our Bro|ther.</P>
<P>He took my hand; and, embracing me as &s;uch, You deal nobly with me, my Lord, &s;aid I. I re&s;ign my&s;elf to your direction.</P>
<P>Jeronymo affectionately held out his arms, and joy|fully &s;aluted me as his Brother. The Marquis, the Count, each took my hand: And, the Marchione&s;s offering hers, I pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips; and, with|drawing, ha&s;tened to my lodgings; with a heart, O Dr. Bartlett, how penetrated by a &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;o &s;trange and unexpected!</P>
<P>But when they attribute to flight, and un&s;oundne&s;s of mind, that glorious pa&s;&s;age, in which &s;he propo&s;es to take a revenge &s;o noble on the cruel Laurana, they &s;eem unable to comprehend, as I can ea&s;ily do, the greatne&s;s of mind of this admirable woman.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXV.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Monday, July <HI>10&mdash;21.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had no call for re&s;t la&s;t night. I only repo&s;ed my|&s;elf in a chair for about an hour. I &s;ent early in the morning a note, to enquire, with the tendere&s;t &s;olicitude, after all their healths; and particularly Clementina's and Jeronymo's. A written an&s;wer was returned by Jeronymo, that his &s;i&s;ter had re&s;ted &s;o ve|ry ill, that it was thought advi&s;eable to keep her quiet all day; unle&s;s &s;he &s;hould be particularly earne&s;t to &s;ee me; and, in that ca&s;e, they would &s;end me word.</P>
<P>I was my&s;elf very much indi&s;po&s;ed; yet had a diffi|culty to deny my&s;elf, tho' uninvited, to attend them at dinner. My own di&s;order, however, determined me not to go, unle&s;s &s;ent for. It would, I thought, be too vi&s;ible to them all; and might rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion, that I wanted to move compa&s;&s;ion: A meanne&s;s of which I am not capable. Yet, indi&s;po&s;ed as I was, &s;till more, in the afternoon, I hoped to have an invitation for half an hour. But not being &s;ent to, I repeated my enquiries in another billet. No invitation followed. On the contrary, Jeronymo wrote one line, wi&s;hing to &s;ee me in the morning.</P>
<P>I had as little re&s;t la&s;t night, as the night before. My impatience carried me to the palace of Porretta &s;ooner than u&s;ual this morning.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo rejoiced to &s;ee me. He hoped I did not take ami&s;s, that they invited me not the day before. To &s;ay the truth, &s;aid he, the day's re&s;t was judged entirely nece&s;&s;ary for you both: For my &s;i&s;ter particularly: And &s;he was &s;o unea&s;y and di&s;|plea&s;ed at your going away on Saturday, without take|ing leave of her, that &s;he was the more ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded not to &s;ee you ye&s;terday. But already this
<PB N="153" REF="154">
morning, I under&s;tand, &s;he a&s;ks after you with im|patience. You are angry at her, &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, and will never &s;ee her more. You had but ju&s;t left us, on Sa|turday night, when Camilla came down with her re|que&s;t to &s;ee you. For my part, proceeded he, my thoughts are &s;o much carried out of my&s;elf, by the extraordinary turn &s;he has taken, that, at times, I for|get I ail any-thing.</P>
<P>He then a&s;ked, if I could forgive his &s;i&s;ter; and re|flected on the Sex, on her account, as never knowing their own minds, but when they meet with ob&s;tacles to their wills. But &s;he mu&s;t, &s;he will, be yours, my Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he; and if it plea&s;e God to re&s;tore her, &s;he will make you rich amends.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti came in, to make their morning compliments to Jeronymo: The Marquis and Count entered &s;oon after, to &s;alute me.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s followed them. Clementina was &s;o unea&s;y on Saturday night, &s;aid &s;he to me, on find|ing you gone without taking leave of her, and &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed all day ye&s;terday, that I cho&s;e not to &s;ay any-thing to her on the great article. I am glad you are come.</P>
<P>Somebody ju&s;t then tapping at the door, Come in, Camilla, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not Camilla; it is I, &s;aid Lady Clementina, en|tering. I am told the Chevalier&mdash;O there he is&mdash;Favour me, Sir, with a few words&mdash;walking to a window at the other end of the room.</P>
<P>I followed her: Tears were in her eyes. She looked earne&s;tly at me: Then turning her face from me&mdash;Why, madam, &s;aid I, taking her hand, why this emotion? I have not, I hope, offended you.</P>
<P>O Chevalier! I cannot bear to be &s;lighted, and lea&s;t of all by you; though, I mu&s;t own, that I de|&s;erve it mo&s;t from you. A &s;light from you is a charge of ingratitude upon me, that my heart cannot bear.</P>
<P>Slight you, madam!&mdash;I revere you, as the mo&s;t
<PB N="154" REF="155">
excellent of women. You have, indeed, filled my heart with angui&s;h: But I admire you more for the cau&s;e of that angui&s;h, than it is po&s;&s;ible for me to ex|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Don't, don't &s;ay &s;o. You will ruin me by your genero&s;ity. I think you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be angry with me. I think you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> treat me ill, or how &s;hall I keep my purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Your purpo&s;e, deare&s;t madam!&mdash;Your purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e! Yes, Sir! Will it afflict you, if I do?</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, madam, but it mu&s;t? What would you think&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my good Chevalier. I am afraid it will: But don't tell me it will. I cannot bear to afflict you.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of every one's con&s;ent, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>That was in compa&s;&s;ion to me, Sir.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Love, &s;aid the Marquis, coming to us, that was at fir&s;t our motive: But now an alliance with the Chevalier Grandi&s;on, in ju&s;tice to his merits, is become our choice.</P>
<P>I bowed to the generous nobleman. She kneeled. Be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of fathers! taking his hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it; let me thank you for bearing with me as you have done. What trouble have I given you!&mdash;All the bu&s;ine&s;s of my future life &s;hall be to &s;hew my gratitude, and my obedience to your will. The Marchione&s;s then tenderly rai&s;ing her, took her to the farther end of the room. They talked low; but we heard all they &s;aid. You were &s;o very indifferent all day ye&s;terday, and la&s;t night, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, that I would not di&s;turb you, Love, for fear of break|ing your re&s;t; el&s;e I would have told you, how de|&s;irous now we all are, of an alliance with the Che|valier Grandi&s;on. No other way can he be rewarded for his goodne&s;s to us all.</P>
<P>Permit me, madam, an&s;wered Clementina, to give
<PB N="155" REF="156">
you the motives of my pre&s;ent conduct; of my <HI>&s;elf|denial;</HI> &s;uch is my value for the Chevalier, I will call it &s;o: If I thought I could make the generous man happy; if I thought I &s;hould not rather puni&s;h than reward him; if I thought I could be happy, in my&s;elf, and my &s;oul would not be endangered; if I thought I could make you and my papa happy, by giving my hand to him; God knows that my heart would not make the lea&s;t &s;cruple. But, madam, the Almighty has laid his hand upon me. My head is not <HI>yet</HI> as it &s;hould be; and, before I took my re&s;o|lution, I con&s;idered every-thing, as much as my poor &s;hattered rea&s;on would permit me to con&s;ider it. This was the way I took&mdash;I prayed that God would direct me. I put my&s;elf in the &s;ituation of another per&s;on, who circum&s;tanced as I was, I &s;uppo&s;ed, came to me for advice. I &s;aw plainly, that I could not de&s;erve the Chevalier, becau&s;e I could not think as he thought, in the mo&s;t important of all articles; and there was no likelihood of his thinking as I thought. I prayed for fortitude. I doubted my&s;elf. I altered and altered what I had written: But &s;till all my alterations ran one way. It was <HI>again&s;t my own wi&s;hes.</HI> So this I took for an an&s;wer to my prayers. I tran&s;cribed it fair; but &s;till I doubted my&s;elf. I would not con&s;ult you, madam: You had declared for the Chevalier. That would not have been to do ju&s;tice to the que&s;tion before me, and to the divine impul&s;e by which I was determined to be governed, if my prayers for it &s;hould be an&s;wered. I let not Camilla know my &s;truggles. I be&s;ought the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin to favour an unhappy maid, who&s;e heart was in her duty, but who&s;e head was di&s;turbed. It was &s;ug|ge&s;ted to me what to do: Yet I would not &s;end to the Chevalier what I had written. I &s;till doubted my heart: And thought I never &s;hould be able to give him the paper. At la&s;t I re&s;olved. But when he came, my heart recoiled. He could not but &s;ee the
<PB N="156" REF="157">
di&s;tre&s;s I was in. I am &s;ure I met with his pity. Could I but give him the paper, thought I, my diffi|culty would be over; for then I am &s;ure, almo&s;t &s;ure that, &s;eeing my &s;cruples, and the rectitude of my pur|po&s;e, he will him&s;elf generou&s;ly &s;upport me in my re|&s;olution. At la&s;t I gave the paper to him. And now let me &s;ay, that I verily think I &s;hall be ea&s;ier in my mind, if I can be allowed to adhere to the contents, yet not be thought ungrateful. Dear ble&s;&s;ed Grandi|&s;on, turning to me, read once more that paper: And then if you will not, if you cannot, &s;et me free; I will obey my friends, and make you as happy as I can.</P>
<P>She turned from every one, and fell upon her knees, Great God, I thank thee, &s;aid &s;he for this &s;erene mo|ment!</P>
<P>Serene as the noble enthu&s;ia&s;t thought her mind, I &s;aw it was too high &s;et. From the turn of her eyes I feared a relap&s;e. It was owing to her greatne&s;s of mind, her rea&s;on and her love combating with each other, that &s;he <HI>ever</HI> was di&s;ordered. I approached her&mdash;Admirable Lady, &s;aid I, be <HI>you</HI> free! Whatever be my de&s;tiny, be <HI>you,</HI> for me, what you wi&s;h to be. If <HI>you</HI> are well and happy, I will, if po&s;&s;ible, make <HI>my|&s;elf</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, coming up to me, and taking my hand, how do I admire you! But <HI>can</HI> you be thus great?</P>
<P>Shall I not emulate, my Lord, &s;uch an example &s;et by a woman? I came over without any intere&s;ted views. I con&s;idered my&s;elf, indeed, as <HI>bound</HI> by the conditions to which I had formerly yielded; but Lady Clementina and your family as <HI>free.</HI> When I was encouraged to hope, I <HI>did</HI> hope. I will now, though with deep regret, go back to my former &s;ituation. If Lady Clementina per&s;i&s;ts in her pre&s;ent re&s;olution, I will endeavour to acquie&s;ce with it. If &s;he &s;hould change her mind, I will hold my&s;elf in readine&s;s to
<PB N="157" REF="158">
receive her hand, as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that can be conferred upon me. Only let me add, that in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the difficulty upon me will be greatly in|crea&s;ed, by the exalted contents of the paper &s;he put into my hands on Saturday.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s taking her daughter's hand and mine&mdash;Why, why, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hould minds thus pair'd be &s;under'd?&mdash;And will you, Chevalier, wait with patience the re&s;ult of my &s;weet child's&mdash;Caprice&mdash;&s;hall I call it?</P>
<P>Detain not my hand, my dear mamma; withdraw|ing it a little wildly&mdash;Let me go up, and pray, that my fortitude of mind, after the pain it has co&s;t me to obtain it, may not for&s;ake me. Adieu! Adieu, Che|valier! I will pray for you as well as for my&s;elf. Ne|ver, never, in my devotions, will we be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Away flew the angel.</P>
<P>She met Camilla in the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;Dear Camilla! I have had an e&s;cape, as far as I know. My hand and the Chevalier's hand, each in one of my mamma's!&mdash;My re&s;olution was in danger. My mamma might have joined them, you know; and then I mu&s;t have been his.</P>
<P>Jeronymo in &s;ilence, but tears in his eyes, attended to the &s;cene between his &s;i&s;ter and &s;he. He embraced me&mdash;Deare&s;t of men, let me repeat my mother's que&s;tion: Can you with patience wait the re&s;ult of this dear girl's caprice?</P>
<P>I can; I will.</P>
<P>But I will talk to her my&s;elf, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>So, &s;aid the Marquis, will we all.</P>
<P>It will be right to do &s;o, added the Count, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould repent when it is too late.</P>
<P>But I believe, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, the Chevalier him&s;elf would not wi&s;h, that Lady Clementina &s;hould be <HI>too</HI> vehemently urged. She pleads her Soul: A &s;trong plea: A plea that &s;hould not be over-ruled. I my&s;elf doubt very much, whether &s;he will be able
<PB N="158" REF="159">
to adhere to her re&s;olution: If &s;he be &s;he will merit Beatification. But let her not be over-per&s;uaded. Once more I &s;hould be glad to read the paper, the con|tents of which have &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed us all.</P>
<P>I had it in my pocket; and he a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to read it aloud. Jeronymo oppo&s;ed his motion: But the Bi&s;hop approving it, he read it. He laid great empha&s;is upon <HI>particular</HI> words, and repeated &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages in it: You will ea&s;ily gue&s;s <HI>which,</HI> my dear friend; and all were as much affected, they owned, as when they heard it fir&s;t read: Yet they joined in one doubt, notwith&s;tanding what &s;he had &s;o lately &s;aid of the deliberation &s;he had given her pur|po&s;e, that &s;he would not be <HI>able</HI> to adhere to her re|&s;olution; and made me many compliments on the oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, my dear friend, if &s;he can continue to intere&s;t her glory in the adherence, and they are not <HI>very</HI> ur|gent with her in my favour, I am inclined to be|lieve, that &s;he has greatne&s;s of mind &s;ufficient to en|able her to carry her re&s;olution into effect. Where piety, my dear friend, engages the heart to give up its fir&s;t fervors to its &s;uperior duties, is it not probable that all temporal impul&s;es &s;hould receive abatement, and become but <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ones? And now will not Father Mare&s;cotti once more try to revive his influences over her mind?&mdash;Is it not his <HI>duty</HI> to do &s;o, zealous Catholic as he is? Can the Bi&s;hop refu&s;e, good man as he is, and as &s;teady in his principles, to &s;econd the Father?</P>
<P>But what trials are the&s;e, my dear Dr. Bartlett, to an expecting heart!&mdash;Will they not &s;erve to convince us of the vanity of all human reliance for happine&s;s? I am in a very &s;erious humour. But what can I &s;ay to <HI>you</HI> on &s;uch &s;ubjects, that you knew not much bet|ter before than I? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let us, I remember you once &s;aid, when we are called upon to act a great or manly part, preach by action.

be needle&s;s."</Q> God only knows, whether the ar|dent heart would be puni&s;hed or rewarded, by the completion of its wi&s;hes: But this I know, that were Clementina to give me both her hand and her heart, and could not, by rea&s;on of religious doubts, be happy with me, I &s;hould my&s;elf be extremely mi&s;er|able; e&s;pecially if I had been earne&s;t to prevail upon her to favour me again&s;t her judgment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVI.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I Was obliged to lay down my pen. My mind was too much di&s;turbed to write on.</P>
<P>We had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e before we quitted Jeronymo's chamber, on this extraordinary &s;ubject. They all, as I told you, expre&s;&s;ed their <HI>doubts,</HI> that the Lady would be able to per&s;i&s;t in her new re&s;o|lution. The Marquis and Marchione&s;s gave their opinion, that &s;he &s;hould be left entirely to the work|ings of her own will: And the Count propo&s;ed, by way of enforcing their opinions, that neither the Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti on one hand (tho' religion was in the que&s;tion) nor Jeronymo and my&s;elf on the other, &s;hould endeavour to prevail upon her either to <HI>alter</HI> or <HI>per&s;evere</HI> in, her way of thinking. Jeronymo &s;aid, he de&s;ired only one conver&s;ation with his &s;i&s;ter alone, before he complied with this propo&s;al.</P>
<P>They put it to me. I &s;aid, That &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in her paper were of too &s;olemn a nature for me to refu&s;e my con&s;ent to their propo&s;al: But, however, if I &s;hould ob&s;erve, in future conver&s;ations between her and me, that &s;he was inclined to alter her mind, and <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to wi&s;h to be encouraged to declare the alteration, they mu&s;t allow me, for the &s;ake of my own honour, as a <HI>man,</HI> and of her delicacy, as a <HI>woman,</HI> to &s;hew the ardour of my attachment to her, by my <HI>preventing</HI> declaration, and even entreaty.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
The Marchione&s;s bowed to me, with a grateful &s;mile of approbation.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti he&s;itated, as if he had &s;omething of an objection to make; but he was &s;ilenced by the Marquis's &s;aying, On <HI>your</HI> honour, on <HI>your</HI> delicacy, I am &s;ure, Chevalier, we may rely.</P>
<P>I am ab&s;olutely of opinion that we may, &s;aid the Count. The Chevalier can put him&s;elf in every one's &s;ituation; and can forget his own intere&s;t, when a right and ju&s;t mea&s;ure is to be taken.</P>
<P>This is true, &s;aid Jeronymo&mdash;But let it be <HI>our</HI> part to &s;hew the Chevalier, that he is not the <HI>only</HI> man in the world who can do &s;o.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember, my dear Jeronymo, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, that Religion is a con&s;ideration &s;uperior to all others. Shall our &s;i&s;ter, who follows the example &s;et her by the Chevalier, he di&s;couraged in an effort &s;o noble? But I am willing to &s;ub&s;cribe to the propo&s;al, as an equal one.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t return me the paper. I mu&s;t often have recour&s;e to it, to &s;trengthen my own mind, in order to enable my&s;elf to an&s;wer your expectations.</P>
<P>The Father de&s;ired leave to take a copy of it in &s;hort|hand; and retired for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but he will make great u&s;e of it with the family, and perhaps with the Lady, &s;hould there be occa&s;ion, hereafter. For my own part, if the noble Enthu&s;ia&s;t, when the heat of her imagina|tion is gone off, &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in believing that &s;he has a divine impul&s;e in favour of her re&s;olution, and <HI>that</HI> given in an&s;wer to her prayers, I will endeavour to &s;hew her, that her call upon me to &s;upport her in it, tho' again&s;t my&s;elf, &s;hall be an&s;wered, whatever it co&s;t me.</P>
<P>They prevailed on me to &s;tay dinner. She excu&s;ed her&s;elf from being pre&s;ent; but de&s;ired to &s;ee me, when it was over.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
Camilla <HI>then</HI> led me to her. I found her in tears. She was afraid, &s;he &s;aid, that I would not forgive her: Yet I <HI>would,</HI> &s;he was &s;ure, if I knew the conflicts with which her &s;oul laboured.</P>
<P>I &s;oothed her di&s;turbed mind. I told her, that I de|&s;ired her direction, and was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue it. Her paper &s;hould be one of my con&s;tant le&s;&s;ons; and <HI>her</HI> con&s;cience the rule of my conduct, with regard to my expectations of her favour.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid &s;he, how good you are! It is from your genero&s;ity, next to the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that I ex|pect &s;upport in my re&s;olution. I but imperfectly re|member what I would have done, and what I con|&s;ented to, when you were la&s;t among us&mdash;But when I <HI>be&s;t</HI> knew my&s;elf, I was more inclined to &s;up|port my parents and brothers in their expectations, with regard to the two great articles of religion and re&s;idence, than to comply with yours. My fortune, my rank, merited your con&s;ideration; and my pride was &s;ometimes piqued. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But it was the regard that I had to the welfare of your immortal &s;oul, that weighed <HI>mo&s;t</HI> with me.

<P>She then wrung her cla&s;ped hands, and tears trickled down her cheeks. God Almighty convert you, Che|valier!&mdash;But you mu&s;t leave me. I am beginning to be again unhappy!&mdash;Leave me, Sir. But let me &s;ee you to-morrow. I will pray for a compo&s;ure of mind, in the mean time. Do you pray for me too. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray for your&s;elf, Chevalier! The welfare of your &s;oul, your immortal &s;oul, was <HI>ever</HI> my principal concern."</Q></P>
<P>She began to ramble. Her looks were a little wild, I took leave of her; and going ha&s;tily from her, in order to hide my own emotion, I &s;urpri&s;ed Father Mare&s;cotti, who, as it was at fir&s;t &s;ight evident to me, from the confu&s;ion I found him in, and the at|tempts he he&s;itatingly made to excu&s;e him&s;elf, had
<PB N="162" REF="163">
been li&s;tening to what pa&s;&s;ed between the Lady and me. Pity! that a well-intended zeal &s;hould make a good man do mean things!</P>
<P>No apologies, my dear Father, &s;aid I. If you doubted my honour, I can think my&s;elf, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, obliged to your <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> for taking this me|thod to prove me. Allow me, my dear Sir, to &s;ay (It is to Father Mare&s;cotti) that the man, who, in the greater actions of his life, thinks him&s;elf under the All|&s;eeing Eye, will not be afraid of a fellow-creature's ear.</P>
<P>I beg a thou&s;and pardons, &s;aid he, he&s;itating, and in confu&s;ion. But I will confe&s;s the truth; I believed it was next to impo&s;&s;ible, that a young man, who&s;e Love to one of the mo&s;t excellent of women is not to be que&s;tioned, &s;hould be able to keep the conditions pre&s;cribed to him, and forbear to make u&s;e of the power &s;he acknowleges he has over her affections&mdash;But forgive me, Chevalier.</P>
<P>Forgive <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> my dear Father; I do mo&s;t hear|tily forgive you.</P>
<P>I led him down to Jeronymo's chamber, begging of him not to &s;ay a &s;yllable more of this matter; and not to let me &s;uffer in his e&s;teem by this accident.</P>
<P>I have more than once, Dr. Bartlett, experienced the irreconcileable enmity of a man whom I have forgiven for a meanne&s;s; and who was le&s;s able to forgive me my forgivene&s;s, than I was him his fault. But Father Mare&s;cotti cannot be &s;uch a man. He is capable of generous &s;hame. He could hardly hold up his head all the time I &s;taid.</P>
<P>I related to the family, in the pre&s;ence of the Fa|ther, the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed between the Lady and me. They &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at her &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. The Bi&s;hop told me, that he had di&s;patched a me&s;|&s;enger po&s;t to the General, with a Letter, in which he had written a faithful account of their pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion. He would &s;hew me a copy of it, if I plea&s;ed.
<PB N="163" REF="164">
I was &s;ure, I &s;aid, I could depend upon his genero&s;ity and honour; and &s;hould be glad to know the &s;enti|ments of the General and his Lady upon it, when they returned an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to attend them in the morning: And going to my lodgings, found there, waiting for me, the Count of Belvedere. Saunders, and his gentleman, were both together below-&s;tairs, waiting for, yet dread|ing, as they &s;aid, my return. Saunders had told the Count, it was uncertain: But he declared that he would wait for me, were it ever &s;o late. They both be&s;ought me to take care of my own &s;afety. His gen|tleman told me, that his ma&s;ter had been very much di&s;turbed in his mind ever &s;ince he was with me la&s;t; declaring often, that his life was a burden to him. He believed, he &s;aid, he had a brace of pi&s;tols with him: And then again expre&s;&s;ed his care for my &s;afety, as well as his Lord's. Fear not, &s;aid I: The Count is a man of honour: I would not, for the world, hurt <HI>him:</HI> And I dare &s;ay he will not hurt <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I ha&s;tened up. Why, my Lord, &s;aid I, taking his unwilling hands, each in mine, for a double rea&s;on, did you not let me know you intended me this honour? Or why did not your Lord&s;hip &s;end for me, as &s;oon as you came?</P>
<P>Send for you! with a melancholy air; What from your Clementina? No!&mdash;But tell me what is conclu|ded upon? My &s;oul is impatient to know. An&s;wer me like a man: An&s;wer me like a man of honour.</P>
<P>Nothing, my Lord, is concluded upon: Nothing can be concluded upon till Lady Clementina's mind be fully known.</P>
<P>If <HI>that</HI> be all the ob&s;tacle&mdash;</P>
<P>Not a &s;light one. I a&s;&s;ure you, that Clementina knows her own worth. She will put a ju&s;t value upon her&s;elf. In her unhappy delirium, &s;he always pre&s;erved a high &s;en&s;e of that delicacy, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the woman of true honour. It &s;hines forth now in all her
<PB N="164" REF="165">
words and actions with redoubled lu&s;tre. She will make the more difficulties, as her friends make le&s;s. Nothing <HI>can</HI> be done <HI>&s;oon:</HI> And if it will make your Lord&s;hip ea&s;ier (for I &s;ee you are di&s;turbed) I will ac|quaint you when any-thing is likely to be carried into effect.</P>
<P>And <HI>is</HI> nothing yet concluded on? And <HI>will</HI> you give me &s;uch notice?</P>
<P>I will, my Lord.</P>
<P>Upon your honour?</P>
<P>Upon my honour.</P>
<P>Well then, I have &s;ome days longer to crawl upon this earth.</P>
<P>What means my Lord?</P>
<P>This I mean, withdrawing his hands from mine, and taking out of his pockets two pi&s;tols: I came re|&s;olved, that you &s;hould take one of the&s;e, at your choice, had the affair been concluded upon, as I dreaded it would. I am no a&s;&s;a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n Sir, nor ever em|ployed one: Nor would I have deprived Clementina of her elected hu&s;band. All I intended was, that the hand to which &s;he is to give hers, &s;hould have fir&s;t taken my life. I will not, I cannot live, to &s;ee her the wife of any man on earth, tho' &s;he has refu&s;ed to be mine&mdash;You &s;hould have <HI>found</HI> I would not.</P>
<P>What a ra&s;hne&s;s!&mdash;But I &s;ee your mind is di&s;turbed. The Count of Belvedere could not otherwi&s;e talk in this manner.</P>
<P>It is not <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;urely, my dear Dr. Bartlett (how|ever <HI>improbable,</HI> as I begin to apprehend) that Clemen|tina may change her mind. I could not, therefore, acquaint the Count with our pre&s;ent &s;ituation; becau&s;e the hope he would have conceived from it, would, in ca&s;e of a change, have added &s;trength to his de&s;pair. I contented my&s;elf, therefore, to rea&s;on with him on his ra&s;h intention. And having renewed my a&s;&s;urances, as above, he took leave of me &s;o much recovered, as to thank me for the advice I had given him; and to

promi&s;e, that he would make it the foundation of his prayers to heaven for a calmer mind, than he had known for &s;ome days pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Saunders and his valet &s;eemed overjoyed at &s;eeing us come down together, in an amicable manner; and in the high civility each paid the other.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that the Count, of his own accord, in pa&s;&s;ing thro' my antechamber to the &s;tairs, laid in one of the windows the two pi&s;tols. My dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, let the&s;e remain in your keeping. They are pieces of curious workman&s;hip. Whither might one of them, by this time, have &s;ent me!&mdash;And in what difficulties might you the &s;urvivor, a fo|reigner, have been involved; which then I con&s;idered not; for all my malice was levelled again&s;t my unhappy &s;elf!

<P>Here I conclude for this night. I will not di&s;patch the&s;e la&s;t-written Letters, till I &s;ee what to-morrow will produce. My dear friend! How grievous is &s;u&s;pen&s;e!&mdash;Perhaps I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf more obliged to bear it, had I been thus entangled, fettered, &s;u&s;pended, by my own fault.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVII.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I Went, according to promi&s;e, in the morning, to the palace of Porretta. I found all the family, the Marchione&s;s and Lady Clementina excepted, in Je|ronymo's chamber. My entrance, I &s;uppo&s;e, was &s;olemn; for Jeronymo, as I approached him, &s;natch|ing my hand, &s;aid, This girl, this capricious, this un|common girl! How can I forgive her for vexing the heart of my Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti looked &s;o con&s;cious, that I pi|tied him. I took his hand, and, with an air of kind|ne&s;s, a&s;ked him&mdash;Are there any hopes, my good Fa|ther,
<PB N="166" REF="167">
that I &s;hall have the honour of calling you one of my deare&s;t hou&s;hold friends in England?</P>
<P>I gave him no time to an&s;wer, le&s;t he &s;hould not be a&s;&s;ured enough: And addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the Bi&s;hop, My Lord, I a&s;k <HI>you</HI> the like que&s;tion: Is there a likelihood, that I &s;hall have an intere&s;t in Father Ma|re&s;cotti's more intimate friend&s;hip? We already, I an&s;wer <HI>for</HI> my&s;elf, and <HI>from</HI> my vanity, love each other.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on! &s;aid the Marquis; and, taking my hand, he called me by the kinde&s;t name&mdash;Saving, that it was not <HI>Son!</HI> Jeronymo dried his eyes. The Count &s;aluted me in a tender accent. The Bi&s;hop was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, thought I, that the admirable Clementina per&s;everes!&mdash;Religion, that can do &s;o much for <HI>her,</HI> will not, I hope, leave <HI>me</HI> unbenefited by its all|chearing influence. If I cannot be &s;o happy as I wi&s;h, I am in the hands of Providence; and will not give my&s;elf up to unmanly de&s;pair&mdash;Yet the greatne&s;s of this woman's mind! thought I&mdash;Why did they not fall upon indulgent methods with her before? Then, probabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, had there not been a &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on for an invitati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n to me to quit my native country, to which I had been &s;o long a &s;tranger, and to come over to Italy!&mdash;Then had &s;he, in all likelihood, recovered her rea&s;on, and I had not known how great &s;he could be; and her filial duty would have di&s;engaged me equally from all obligations of honour, and expectations of favour!</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s came in &s;oon after. Her addre&s;s to me confirmed me in my apprehen&s;ions&mdash;Dear Gran|di&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, conde&s;cendingly laying her hand on mine, how do you? See our dear Jeronymo&mdash;How much better he is&mdash;What return can we make to you for your goodne&s;s to him; I went up to the dear girl la&s;t night, after you were gone. She was then in|deed a little hy&s;terical. But the di&s;order went off in prayers for you and for her&s;elf. I am ju&s;t come from
<PB N="167" REF="168">
her. She has had a quiet night. She is calm, and I may &s;ay, &s;erene. All her cares are in what manner to &s;hew her gratitude to you.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, madam, but I mu&s;t have joy in your joy. Lady Clementina, I apprehend, per&s;everes in her re&s;olution!&mdash;</P>
<P>I have talked to her, Chevalier, in your favour. If you love her, &s;he &s;ays, as we all think you do, &s;he will <HI>yet</HI> be yours.</P>
<P>Dear madam (overjoyed) tell me&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me interrupt you, Chevalier: I mu&s;t not mi&s;|lead you, nor keep you in &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;She will, &s;he &s;ays, beg your acceptance of her vows&mdash;if&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> what, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Hear me with patience, Chevalier&mdash;If you will comply with the conditions, on which we would have permited her to be yours, when you were la&s;t in Italy&mdash;This is her <HI>own</HI> propo&s;al&mdash;Made at her <HI>own</HI> motion&mdash;She is afraid it will be to no purpo&s;e (&s;he &s;ays <HI>afraid,</HI> Sir): But as you have not denied her to her&s;elf, &s;he begs I will put the que&s;tion to you in her name, for the &s;ake (if you &s;hould refu&s;e her) of her own future tranquillity of mind. The Chevalier Gran|di&s;on is generous; he is ju&s;t; he is polite: He cannot but receive this motion of my child by her mother, as the greate&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion from both.</P>
<P>I bowed. I was going to &s;peak; but they all &s;eve|rally broke in upon me.</P>
<P>On my knees, Chevalier, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti, I will entreat you!</P>
<P>O Chevalier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, how happy is it in your power to make us all!</P>
<P>Surely you <HI>can,</HI> you <HI>will,</HI> you <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> Chevalier! &s;aid the Count, if you love the dear creature, as we all &s;uppo&s;e you do.</P>
<P>You will not, I hope, dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Marquis, <HI>refu&s;e</HI> my daughter. A&s;k <HI>any</HI> conditions of us&mdash;She &s;hall be with you in England in a month's
<PB N="168" REF="169">
time. We will accompany her thither; and &s;tay till you &s;hall choo&s;e to return with us.</P>
<P>Jeronymo, with &s;obs, caught my hand as I &s;at next him&mdash;For <HI>God</HI>'s &s;ake, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, for <HI>all</HI> our &s;akes, for your &s;oul's &s;ake, my Grandi&s;on, be ours. Let your Jeronymo call you Brother.</P>
<P>If <HI>my</HI> tears, if my prayers, have weight, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, let me call down my child, and &s;he &s;hall give you her hand in our pre&s;ence. She thinks, be&s;ides the regard &s;he has for your &s;oul, that &s;he ought to in&s;i&s;t upon the terms on which we would have <HI>con|&s;ented</HI> to make her yours, in gratitude for our com|pliance with her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Grandi&s;on! rejoined the Bi&s;hop, <HI>Refu&s;e not</HI> my &s;i&s;ter: <HI>Refu&s;e not</HI> the daughter of the Marche&s;e and Marche&s;a della Porretta: <HI>Refu&s;e not</HI> the a&s;&s;enting Clementina.</P>
<P>They were all &s;ilent; their eyes were upon me. It is, an&s;wered I, too, too conde&s;cendingly generous to put this ta&s;k upon me: But, <HI>Refu&s;e</HI> Lady Clemen|tina, &s;aid you! How you wound my &s;oul by the &s;up|po&s;ition! I &s;ee your compa&s;&s;ion for me, in the light you cannot but <HI>mean</HI> I &s;hould. Lady Clementina's generou&s;ly and conde&s;cendingly meant propo&s;al, when I am willing to allow terms to <HI>her,</HI> that &s;he will not to <HI>me,</HI> &s;hews me how important &s;he thinks the dif|ference between the two religions: Need I repeat my, Lord (to the Bi&s;hop) what my own thoughts are upon this &s;ubject? Would to heaven the terms were no other than tho&s;e <HI>before agreed to;</HI> or were &s;uch as I could comply with! I have only to con&s;ole my&s;elf, that the power of <HI>Refu&s;al</HI> lies where it <HI>ought</HI> to lie. Clementina is an angel. I am not worthy of her. Yet, let me add, this company (bowing round me) cannot think me too &s;olemn&mdash;Were I to live always here; were I convinced that there is no life after this; your commands and <HI>Clementina</HI>'s would be Laws to me. But has &s;he not the goodne&s;s to &s;ay, in her paper, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That
<PB N="169" REF="170">
I have the &s;ame notion &s;he has of the brevity and vanity of this world's glory, and of the duration of that to come?"</Q></P>
<P>They looked upon one another. It is hard, very hard, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, for a man, convinced of the truth of his religion, to allow to another of a different per&s;ua&s;ion, what he expects &s;hould be allowed for him|&s;elf. <HI>You,</HI> Chevalier, however, can allow it; and have greatne&s;s of mind enough to judge favourably of tho&s;e who cannot. I do love you; but fain would I love you more.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s wept. My dear Love, &s;aid the Marquis, taking her hand with the tenderne&s;s of a Lover, but &s;peaking a little too &s;everely of me for his u&s;ual genero&s;ity&mdash;How many tears has this affair co&s;t you! My heart bleeds to &s;ee you weep. Comfort your&s;elf. Let us comfort each other. The Chevalier Grandi&s;on is indeed unworthy of our child; unworthy of the terms we offered to him; unworthy of our joint entreaties&mdash;He is an invincible man.</P>
<P>I was greatly affected. After a little he&s;itation, I a&s;k leave, my Lords, &s;aid I, to retire for one mo|ment. I will return as &s;oon as I have recovered my|&s;elf from the concern given me by the&mdash;<HI>mi&s;</HI>-appre|hen&s;ion (&s;hall I call it?) of the be&s;t of men, whom from my heart I reverence.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e as I &s;poke, withdrew, and took two or three turns in the &s;alon.</P>
<P>I &s;taid not till I was &s;ent for: But a&s;&s;uming as chear|ful an air as I could, returned; and found them earne&s;t in talk. They all aro&s;e at my return, &s;eemingly plea&s;ed with it; and the Marquis coming to me, Chevalier, &s;aid he, I am &s;orry&mdash;</P>
<P>Not one word of apology, my Lord, interrupted I. I withdrew not from di&s;re&s;pect, or in re&s;entment; but purely from concern, that, in <HI>your</HI> opinion, I de|&s;erved not the honour done me, by one &s;o dear to you. Think me unhappy, my Lord, and pitty me.
<PB N="170" REF="171">
Principle, not perver&s;ene&s;s, influences me: It does every one pre&s;ent: It does the dear Lady above: And &s;hall we not allow for one another, when we are all actuated by the &s;ame motive?</P>
<P>O that I could embrace my fourth &s;on! &s;aid the Marchione&s;s. The Bi&s;hop threw his arms about me. Generous expan&s;ion of <HI>heart!</HI> were the words that fell from his lips. Jeronymo &s;hewed his friendly Love in what he &s;aid: And <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not, &s;aid the Count, this young man be one of us?</P>
<P>After chocolate, the Marchione&s;s withdrew to the window, making a motion to me to attend her. I ha&s;tened to her. She complimented me, &s;peaking low, as a fit per&s;on to be con&s;ulted in a ca&s;e where fe|male delicacy was concerned; and then a&s;ked me, what I would have her &s;ay to Clementina, who had <HI>offered</HI> her hand to me on conditions, with which &s;he had hopes I would comply? Mu&s;t I tell the dear child, &s;he is <HI>rejected?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lady Clementina rejected!</HI>&mdash;Dear madam, how can I bear that &s;he &s;hould but &s;uppo&s;e it?&mdash;Be plea&s;ed to tell her, that I have been again &s;ounded on the &s;ubject of a change of religion, <HI>if</HI> her favour for me could be procured: But that I was &s;o &s;teady in my faith, that there were no hopes of my <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> as you will call it: And be &s;o good as to remind her (it may look like a breach of conditions if <HI>I</HI> do) that I require not a change in <HI>her;</HI> and that therefore the terms propo&s;ed are unequal.</P>
<P>Fain, very fain, Chevalier, would I&mdash;She &s;topt there&mdash;But no more on this &s;ubject. I will &s;ee in what way the dear creature is now.</P>
<P>She left me, and went to her daughter. The &s;ub|ject was changed.</P>
<P>In about half an hour &s;he returned. She told me, that &s;he had followed my advice; but that Clementina &s;eemed di&s;&s;atisfied and perplexed: And, as &s;he had not <HI>a&s;ked</HI> to &s;ee me, advi&s;ed me to &s;u&s;pend my attendance
<PB N="171" REF="172">
on her till the afternoon, as &s;he would by that means have more time to compo&s;e her &s;pirits; and her&s;elf further opportunities of talking with her.</P>
<P>Declining their invitation to dinner, I went to my lodgings; and to amu&s;e my&s;elf, had recour&s;e to my pen.</P>
<P>Having written thus far, I lay it down till my re|turn from them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVIII.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>AT my entrance into the palace of Porretta, I was de&s;ired to walk into the garden to the Bi&s;hop. I found with him Father Mare&s;cotti.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, meeting me, and taking my hand, you mu&s;t decide a point between the Father and me, that we are afraid has made us a little accountable to you.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent. He proceeded.</P>
<P>Clementina is very &s;edate. She &s;ent for me and the Father, &s;oon after you left us. She a&s;ked us &s;everal que&s;tions in relation to you; and in&s;i&s;ted on our ad|vice, as religious men, and as we would an&s;wer for it to our own con&s;ciences. Her fir&s;t was, Whether we thought there were any hopes of your conver&s;ion?&mdash;I an&s;wered negatively.</P>
<P>I don't expect, &s;aid &s;he, that he would be induced to change his religion for a wife, nor even for a crown, were he not convinced of the fal&s;hood of his own, and the truth of ours: But again I a&s;k, Cannot you and Father Mare&s;cotti convince his judgment? I &s;hould think it would not be &s;o hard a ta&s;k, learned and good men, as you both are: Good man, and mode&s;t, and patient, and unpre&s;uming, as he is; who has been &s;o long among Catholics; who came from England &s;o young; has been left &s;o much to his own direction;
<PB N="172" REF="173">
and who mu&s;t &s;ee the difference of the two religions to the advantage of ours, were he but to judge by the efficacy of each on the lives and manners of the people profe&s;&s;ing each; for, &s;urely, the men of name and family, who are &s;ent among us by their parents, from the heretic countries, in order to ob&s;erve our manners, and to improve their own, are not the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of the people of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>I told her, proceeded the Bi&s;hop, that, to be im|partial, there were bad and good of all nations; that &s;he was not likely to be approached by any of her <HI>own</HI> but who were good; that you, Chevalier, and Mrs. Beaumont, might convince us that there were good people among the Prote&s;tants; and that now-and then a young man of that profe&s;&s;ion, did <HI>actually</HI> ap|pear among us, who was <HI>not</HI> a di&s;credit to his country. But, continued I, I have heretofore debated the &s;ubject with the Chevalier Grandi&s;on. You know I was in a manner called upon to do it: And have found him a Prote&s;tant upon principle; and that he has a great deal to &s;ay for him&s;elf. You, Father, would not allow me this; but you never entered into clo&s;e ar|gument with him on the &s;ubject, as I have done.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter then a&s;ked, proceeded the Bi&s;hop, if I thought that her own religious principles would be en|dangered, if &s;he became yours, and went with you to England?</P>
<P>We both referred her to certain pa&s;&s;ages in the paper &s;he gave you.</P>
<P>My heart, &s;aid &s;he, could never be proof again&s;t a generous and kind treatment. The conde&s;cending compliances with my weakne&s;s, which my father, mo|ther, brothers, and uncle, have made, have effected what oppo&s;ition and cruelty, as you &s;ee, could not. So compa&s;&s;ionate, &s;o humane a man, as I think the Chevalier Grandi&s;on, and &s;o &s;teady as he is in his prin|ciples, &s;o much, as you own, as he has to &s;ay for him|&s;elf, joined with the &s;en&s;e I always had, from my

<HI>mother's</HI> example, of the duties of a good wife, will too probably &s;tagger me in my faith: And if &s;o, I &s;hall be unhappy: I &s;hall make my confe&s;&s;or &s;o. I am <HI>determined,</HI> added &s;he (as you, brother, have &s;een) in my own mind: But I a&s;k your opinion, and yours, Father Mare&s;cotti. The Chevalier now is a favou|rite with you both. Religion only can now be the que&s;tion&mdash;Is it not too probable that I &s;hall be &s;tag|gered in my own faith, were I to be his?</P>
<P>We gave her, continued the Bi&s;hop, our opinions freely, as religious men. <HI>Could</HI> we, Chevalier, do otherwi&s;e? And yet we are both ready to accu&s;e our|&s;elves of infringing conditions with you. Tell us, if n your opinion we have?</P>
<P>I cannot, my Lord, judge from this general ac|count. If you did <HI>more</HI> than an&s;wer her que&s;tions; if you expatiated <HI>argumentatively</HI> on the &s;ubject; I mu&s;t think you <HI>have:</HI> And your own doubts help to convince me, that you have; tho' I cannot but re&s;pect you greatly for the frankne&s;s of your application to me on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We <HI>were</HI> earne&s;t, Chevalier; we <HI>were</HI> warm in what we &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, my Lord, called upon as you both were, it would not have become your characters to be cool&mdash;For my own part, I have been recollecting the beha|viour of your admirable &s;i&s;ter throughout every &s;tage of her delirium, re&s;pecting my&s;elf: And I have not been able to call to mind one in&s;tance in it of an at|tachment <HI>merely</HI> per&s;onal. I need not tell you, Father, nor you, my Lord, what a zealous Catholic &s;he is, She <HI>early</HI> wi&s;hed me to be one: And had I not thought my&s;elf obliged in honour, becau&s;e of the confidence placed in me by the whole family, to decline the &s;ub|ject, our particular conver&s;ations, when &s;he favoured me with the name of tutor, would have generally taken that turn. Her unhappy illne&s;s was owing to her zeal for religion, and to her concealing her &s;trug|gles
<PB N="174" REF="175">
on that account. She never hinted at marriage in her re&s;veries. She was &s;till &s;olicitous for the SOUL of the man &s;he wi&s;hed to pro&s;elyte; and declared her|&s;elf ready to lay down her life, could &s;he have effected that favourite wi&s;h of her heart. At other times, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed my marriage with &s;ome other woman; and was only generou&s;ly &s;olicitous, that it &s;hould not be with one who might di&s;credit the regard &s;he her&s;elf profe&s;&s;ed for me. At another time &s;he wi&s;hed to be acquainted with my &s;i&s;ters, and hoped they would come to Italy: She propo&s;ed to perfect them in the Italian tongue, as they &s;hould her in the Engli&s;h: But as to me, only be&s;poke a vi&s;it from me now-and-then, when they came. I have the vanity to think, that I &s;tand high in her favour. But religion, it is evident, as it ought, &s;tands higher. From all the&s;e recollections and ob&s;ervations, I have endeavoured to account for the noble behaviour of your &s;i&s;ter; and am the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at it, now &s;he is come to her me|mory. It is all great; all uniform; and mo&s;t pro|bably we &s;hould have been in a very different &s;ituation than what we have been long in, had &s;he had her way given her at the time &s;he was &s;o earne&s;t&mdash;For what! <HI>Only</HI> to be allowed a <HI>&s;econd</HI> interview, a fare|wel vi&s;it, when &s;he had &s;hewn a little before, on a <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that marriage &s;eemed not to be in her thoughts.</P>
<P>And had &s;he not been entru&s;ted to the management of the cruel Laurana, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop&mdash;</P>
<P>From which, thank God, &s;aid the Father, I was the in&s;trument of freeing her.</P>
<P>By all this, proceeded I, I mean not recrimination; but only to ob&s;erve the con&s;i&s;tency of the noble Lady's mind, when &s;he was <HI>able</HI> to reflect. And what now remains for me to do, but to reconcile my&s;elf, if po&s;|&s;ible, to a conduct that I mu&s;t ever admire, however I may, in its con&s;equences, as to my own particular, regret it?&mdash;Your Lord&s;hip, I am afraid, thinks, that &s;he adheres to the contents of the paper &s;he put into my hands.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">
Unle&s;s you, Chevalier&mdash;</P>
<P>That, my Lord is out of the que&s;tion. Let it, however, be remembred, that I have not pre&s;cribed to her that hard condition, which is made an indi&s;|pen&s;able one to me. Yet is Lady Clementina the only woman on earth that I would have <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> to call mine, on the terms on which I &s;hould have been proud to receive her hand: For it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that, ge|nerally, great inconveniencies mu&s;t attend a marriage between per&s;ons of a different religion, one of them zealous, the other not indifferent.</P>
<P>But, Chevalier, you acquit Father Mare&s;cotti and me.</P>
<P>I do, my Lord. Be you your own judges. The <HI>condition</HI> was not propo&s;ed by me. I con&s;ented to it, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who pre&s;cribed it, and for your &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake. I could not wi&s;h to pro&s;ecute my hum|ble &s;uit, notwith&s;tanding her declared favour for me, again&s;t the pleas of con&s;cience which &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly urged. How could I, while religion, and the gene|ro&s;ity of her friends to her, required, as &s;he thought, that &s;he &s;hould get above all regards for me? I was therefore willing to comply with the propo&s;al, and to wait the i&s;&s;ue of her &s;pontaneous determination, and to be governed by it. But now that your Lord&s;hip and Father Mare&s;cotti have di&s;pen&s;ed with the condi|tion, I pre&s;ume that I am not bound by it.</P>
<P>What means my Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>Only this: I could not be thought to bear a Love &s;o fervent to the admirable Clementina, as the man ought to bear who a&s;pires to the honour of calling her his, if I made not <HI>one</HI> effort to convince her, that &s;he may be happy with me as to the article &s;he is &s;o &s;o|licitous about&mdash;From <HI>female delicacy,</HI> &s;he may perhaps, <HI>expect</HI> to be argued with, and to be per&s;uaded. Allow me to give her a&s;&s;urances of my inviolable honour in that point. It becomes me, as a man, and as her
<PB N="176" REF="177">
admirer, to remove her &s;cruples, if I <HI>can,</HI> before I yield up my Love to the force of them.</P>
<P>Would you <HI>argue</HI> with her on the merits of the two per&s;ua&s;ions?</P>
<P>I would not. I never did. I would only a&s;&s;ure her of my firm re&s;olution never to attempt to bring her over to mine, nor to traver&s;e the endeavours of her confe&s;&s;or, to keep her &s;teady in hers. But were we to con&s;ider only her future ea&s;e of mind [You, &s;ee my Lord, that &s;he her&s;elf has a view to that, in the pro|po&s;al made me, as from her&s;elf] in which the happine&s;s of all your family is included, it is right to &s;ee if &s;he builds on a foundation that cannot be &s;haken; that &s;he may not hereafter regret the &s;teps &s;he has taken, which might po&s;&s;ibly&mdash;</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Chevalier&mdash;It is prudently, it is kindly, put, as well for her &s;ake, as ours.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad, my Lord, that you &s;hould be within hearing of every word that &s;hall pa&s;s between us on this occa&s;ion. <HI>One</HI> effort I <HI>ought</HI> to make. If &s;he is determined, I will not urge her further. For all the world, and the dear Clementina in it, I would not have her act again&s;t her con&s;cience: Nor will I take advantage of the declaration &s;he has repeatedly made, that it is in my power to hold her fa&s;t, or to &s;et her free. I will not &s;o much as urge it to her, left, if &s;he &s;hould alter her purpo&s;e, it &s;hould be from the con&s;cience of a kind of promi&s;e implied in that decla|ration, and not from her heart. No, my Lord, &s;he &s;hall be <HI>wholly</HI> free. I will not, excellent as &s;he is, accept of her hand again&s;t her con&s;cience: Neither my con&s;cience, nor let me &s;ay, my pride, will permit me to do &s;o. But the world, as well as my own heart, would blame me if I made not one effort. If it fail, I &s;hall be ea&s;ier in my own mind; and &s;o will &s;he in hers. Be you, my Lord, within hearing of our next conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I would not, Dr. Bartlett, propo&s;e to Father Ma|re&s;cotti,
<PB N="177" REF="178">
that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould, for fear of making him un|ea&s;y, on his li&s;tening to what pa&s;&s;ed between the Lady and me.</P>
<P>I can ab&s;olutely depend upon your honour, Cheva|lier, replied the Bi&s;hop. We have brought our&s;elves to be <HI>&s;incere</HI> favourers of this alliance with you. But I own to you, that both Father Mare&s;cotti and my|&s;elf, on the unexpected turn my &s;i&s;ter has voluntarily taken, are of opinion, that you will <HI>both</HI> be happier, if it take not place. The difference in religion; her malady&mdash;</P>
<P>No more, my Lord, of this &s;ubject. If I cannot &s;ucceed, I mu&s;t endeavour to draw con&s;olation to my|&s;elf from rea&s;on and reflexion. Mean time, all I a&s;k is, that you will both acquit me of any &s;uppo&s;ed breach of condition, as well in your own minds, as to the re&s;t of the family, if I make this <HI>one</HI> effort: After which, if it &s;ucceed not, I will, whatever I &s;uffer, dive&s;t my|&s;elf of Self, and join with you, and Father Mare&s;cotti, to &s;ecure the ground gained in the re&s;toration of the noble&s;t of female minds.</P>
<P>They looked upon each other, as if they were afraid of the event. The Father whi&s;pered the Bi|&s;hop. I believe, by a word or two that I could not but hear, it was to induce him to place him&s;elf &s;o as to hear (as I had propo&s;ed) the conver&s;ation that was next to pa&s;s between the Lady and me.</P>
<P>Turning round on their whi&s;pering, Don't I &s;ee Camilla, my Lord, &s;aid I, at di&s;tance, watching our motions, as if &s;he wanted an opportunity to &s;peak to one of us?</P>
<P>She has been walking for &s;ome time within &s;ight, &s;aid Father Mare&s;cotti.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop made &s;igns to her to advance. She did. And told me, that her young Lady was de&s;irous to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I followed her. Clementina was alone. Camilla introduced me to her, and withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
She was in great confu&s;ion on my approach. Her complexion frequently varied. She looked at me of|ten, and as often turned away her eyes; and &s;ighed. Two or three times &s;he hemm'd, as if &s;he would have cleared her voice; but could not find words to expre&s;s her labouring mind. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that her perplexity was not favourable to me. I thought it would be cruel, not to break the way for her to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Let not my dear Clementina forbear to &s;ay all that is in her heart, to the man who greatly prefers her peace of mind to his own.</P>
<P>I had, I had, &s;aid &s;he, a great deal to &s;ay, before I <HI>&s;aw</HI> you: But now you are <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>&mdash;She &s;topt.</P>
<P>Take time to recollect your&s;elf, madam&mdash;I have been talking in the garden to my Lord the Bi&s;hop, and to Father Mare&s;cotti. I greatly revere them both. You have con&s;ulted them on the contents of the paper you are plea&s;ed to put into my hands. I have hopes from <HI>thence,</HI> that you may be made ea&s;y in your mind. I will never, deare&s;t madam, urge you on the article of Religion. You &s;hall be ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of your own will. You &s;hall pre&s;cribe to me what conditions you plea&s;e, with regard to your way of life, your plea&s;ures, your gratuities to your &s;ervants, and others. Father Mare&s;cotti and your Camilla with you, you will be as &s;afe from innovation, as you can be in your father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah Chevalier!</P>
<P>We may, perhaps, prevail upon your father and mother to honour us with their company, in your fir&s;t journey to England. They have not been of late &s;o well as it were to be wi&s;hed: We have baths there of &s;overeign efficacy, in many di&s;orders. By u&s;ing them, and change of climate, they will very probably receive benefit in their healths. Jeronymo&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier!&mdash;She aro&s;e from her &s;eat, and re|&s;eated her&s;elf &s;everal times, with great emotion. I proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">
Jeronymo, our dear Jeronymo, I hope will accom|pany us, and his &s;kilful Lowther. Tho&s;e baths are re&s;torative.</P>
<P>O Chevalier! what a man you are?&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;topt with an air of attention, as if &s;he wi&s;hed me to proceed.</P>
<P>&mdash;And when your honoured and beloved friends &s;hall &s;ee their Clementina happy, as I am determined &s;he &s;hall be, if all the tenderne&s;s of affection I am able to &s;hew, can make her &s;o, how happy will they <HI>all</HI> be?&mdash;Your chapel, madam! Your confe&s;&s;or! Your own &s;ervants!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! Sir!&mdash;Ought I to li&s;ten to &s;uch tempta|tions, after what I have given you, upon deliberation, in writing? Good Heaven! and the whole heavenly ho&s;t! direct me!&mdash;</P>
<P>She had recour&s;e to her beads; and her lips, as a word now-and-then half-pronounced informed me, moved to a Pater-no&s;ter. Again &s;he a&s;&s;umed an at|tentive air.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> &s;i&s;ters, madam, will revere you. You will have plea&s;ure in calling them <HI>yours.</HI> Their Lords are men of the fir&s;t figure in their country. I a&s;k not for for|tune. I a&s;k only for <HI>you,</HI> and you I a&s;k of your&s;elf. My e&s;tate is con&s;iderable, and improving. The pride I take in being independent, and in the power of obliging, &s;uffers me not to be imprudent with regard to oeconomy. My capital man&s;ion (I value it for not being a hou&s;e of ye&s;terday) tho' not &s;o magnifi|cent as your palace in Bologna, is genteel, &s;pacious, convenient. The paper you gave me, &s;hews me that the grandeur of your &s;oul is equal to that of your birth. I revere you for the pious and noble &s;entiments con|tained in it. What obligations will you lay me under to your goodne&s;s, if you can prevail upon your&s;elf to rely upon my a&s;&s;urances, that I will <HI>never</HI> &s;eek to make you unhappy on a religious account; and if you can be &s;atisfied with the enjoyment of your own religion,

and leave to me the exerci&s;e of mine! Dear madam, <HI>why</HI> may not this be? <HI>Why</HI> will you not leave me as free as I am ready to leave you? Ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, are my pleas to a Lady, who &s;urely cannot <HI>but</HI> be ju&s;t and generous. Think, madam; dear Lady Cle|mentina, think; if you cannot, by making me hap|py, be your&s;elf &s;o.</P>
<P>I took her unre&s;i&s;ting hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it. She &s;ighed. She wept. She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>With what plea&s;ure, proceeded I, will you every other year vi&s;it and revi&s;it England, and your native country! How dear will you be to your old friends, and to your new, in turn!

<P>Be propitious, madam, be propitious, to my hum|ble hope; that is all I will at pre&s;ent &s;ay: and now I obey you&mdash;Profoundly bowing, I withdrew into the next apartment. She to her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I went out &s;lowly; and heard the ha&s;ty motion of &s;omebody going out of the apartment, as I entered it. It was, it &s;eems, the Bi&s;hop, who had placed him&s;elf within hearing of what pa&s;&s;ed between his &s;i&s;ter and me, as I had de&s;ired he would.</P>
<P>It was a full quarter of an hour before I heard her move; and then it was to &s;eek for me.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting in a pen&s;ive mood, revolving the em|barra&s;ments I had met with from &s;ome of the be&s;t of women; and, as you, my dear Dr. Bartlett, know, in different countries; and particularly the unexpected turn which the excellent creature had taken. She ap|proached me with an air of maje&s;ty, yet mixed with tenderne&s;s. I met her, and, with a bent knee, taking her hand&mdash;My fate hangs upon tho&s;e lips, &s;aid I; and was proceeding; when interrupting me&mdash;O Sir! I hear not, it is not <HI>&s;afe</HI> for me to hear, <HI>that</HI> voice, ac|companying <HI>this</HI> manner&mdash;Let me bend to you&mdash;I have been craving the divine direction.

I doubt not <HI>your</HI> ju&s;tice, <HI>your</HI> genero&s;ity&mdash;But I fear <HI>my|&s;elf!</HI>&mdash;Seek not, let me repeat, and looked a little wildly, &s;eek not, kinde&s;t of men, to entangle me with your Love.</P>
<P>She bent her knee, and I was afraid would have fainted. I cla&s;ped my &s;upporting arms about her.</P>
<P>Let me, let me cut &s;hort all I intended to &s;ay, &s;aid &s;he, by referring to my paper. The contents of that <HI>are not, cannot</HI> be, an&s;wered to my &s;atisfaction. Be my advocate to your&s;elf, to your own heart, and &s;eek not to entangle me with your Love.</P>
<P>Whatever it co&s;t me, taking both her hands in mine, and bowing upon them, I will yield to your plea&s;ure. I never will urge you again on this &s;ubject, unle&s;s your brother the Bi&s;hop give me hope of your welcome change of mind.</P>
<P>Be&s;t of men, &s;aid &s;he, withdrawing her hands, and cla&s;ping them together!&mdash;But this is not enough&mdash;You mu&s;t promi&s;e me your future friend&s;hip. You mu&s;t let me call you <HI>Brother:</HI> You mu&s;t be my <HI>Tutor,</HI> I your <HI>Pupil,</HI> once more&mdash;Happy days were tho&s;e! The hap|pie&s;t of my life! And encourage and confirm in me the re&s;olution I have taken, or I &s;hall not be happy!</P>
<P>Look upon me, madam, as your brother, as your friend: But this latter ta&s;k requires more magnanimity than I am ma&s;ter of. To your brother the Bi&s;hop, and to Father Mare&s;cotti, I mu&s;t leave that ta&s;k. They will be in earne&s;t in it. I cannot; becau&s;e I am convinced, in my own mind, that we might have been happy&mdash;Could you&mdash;But I forbear, tho' with difficulty&mdash;I have promi&s;ed not to urge you further.</P>
<P>Indeed I have cou&s;ulted them both, re&s;umed &s;he; but not before I had given you my written determina|tion: Had they given their opinions <HI>different</HI> from what they did, I never could have got over the ap|prehen&s;ions I have of your &s;trength, and my own
<PB N="183" REF="184">
weakne&s;s. I only con&s;ulted them, in hopes they would (as they could, or thy had not been good Catho|lics) confirm and &s;trengthen my mind. And why, why, &s;hould I puni&s;h the man, I mu&s;t for ever e&s;teem as my be&s;t friend, with a wife, that her unhappy ma|lady has made unworthy of him? Dear Chevalier, I find my&s;elf at times not recovered. I may never be quite well. <HI>You</HI> and <HI>yours</HI> de&s;erve not to be puni&s;hed but rewarded. Believe me, Sir, this has been a <HI>&s;econd</HI> con&s;ideration with me. God enable me to adhere to my re&s;olution! for his &s;ake, for your &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of my own peace of mind!</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not be difficult, my dear Dr. Bartlett, more difficult than when I came over to Bologna, to give up all hopes of &s;o exalted a woman?</P>
<P>But &s;ay, Chevalier, you are not angry with me. Say, that you do not, that you will not, think me un|grateful. To obviate &s;uch a charge as that of ingra|titude, to a man who has laid us all under &s;uch obli|gations&mdash;What is it that I would not do?</P>
<P>I <HI>cannot</HI> be di&s;plea&s;ed with you, madam. You <HI>can|not</HI> be ungrateful. I mu&s;t not &s;peak: Yet hardly know how to be &s;ilent. I will take a walk in the garden. I have a new le&s;&s;on to learn.</P>
<P>With profound reverence I withdrew. She rang. Camilla came in&mdash;</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened into the garden, greatly di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf, yet hardly knowing why. I thought I want|ed &s;omebody to accu&s;e, &s;omebody to blame&mdash;Yet how could it be Clementina? But the words <HI>Narrow zeal!&mdash;Sweet Enthu&s;ia&s;t!</HI>&mdash;as if I would find fault with her <HI>religion,</HI> involuntarily &s;lipt from me to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is difficult, my dear Dr. Bartlett, at the in&s;tant in which the heart finds it&s;elf di&s;appointed of &s;ome dar|ling hope, to avoid reflexions that, however, can only be ju&s;tified by &s;elf-partiality. What mu&s;t I be, if led as I have been, by all her friends to hope, I had not been <HI>earne&s;t</HI> in my hope!</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185">
The Bi&s;hop joined me in the garden&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, for breaking in upon your con|templations: But I was de&s;irous to apologize to you, for taking the liberty, tho' you allowed it to me, of attending to what pa&s;&s;ed between you and my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, my Lord, have &s;aid every-thing I did &s;ay to your &s;i&s;ter, the occa&s;ion the &s;ame, before your whole a&s;&s;embled family. Your Lord&s;hip has there|fore no apologies to make to me. Heard you all that pa&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>I believe I did. Tho&s;e apartments were always the womens. Camilla placed me in a clo&s;et that I knew not of, where I heard every word you both &s;aid of the la&s;t part of your conver&s;ation. I mu&s;t a&s;k you, Cheva|lier&mdash;<HI>Is</HI> not Clementina&mdash;</P>
<P>Clementina, my Lord, is all that is great and good in woman. You will imagine, that it would have been much more ea&s;y for me to &s;upport my&s;elf under the re&s;olution &s;he has taken, had I not had &s;uch te&s;ti|monies of her magnanimity. Permit me, my Lord, to &s;ay, that I have one good quality: I can admire goodne&s;s or greatne&s;s where-ever I meet with it; and whether it makes for me, or again&s;t me. Clemen|tina has all my reverence.</P>
<P>He made me compliments, and withdrew.</P>
<P>The Marquis, the Count, and the Marchione&s;s, af|terwards joined me in the garden. The Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti not coming with them, or pre&s;ently after them, I doubted not but they went to Clemen|tina, in order to applaud her for, and confirm her in, a re&s;olution, which mu&s;t be agreeable to them. I was right in my conjecture.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Count each took my hand, and fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urprize at the young Lady's ad|herence to her re&s;olution; and next their high value of me. The Marchione&s;s ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that her daugh|ter, with all her excellencies, was ever difficult of per&s;ua&s;ion, when &s;he had deliberately re&s;olved upon any point."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">
It was ea&s;y, I &s;aid, to &s;ee, that they all now were of one opinion: which was, that Lady Clementina was not to be moved from her pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>They owned they were: But &s;aid, that if it were not <HI>mine,</HI> they thought them&s;elves bound in honour to con&s;ent, that I &s;hould try, by generous means (and they were &s;ure I would not think of any other) to pre|vail upon her in my favour.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, &s;aid I, that the Bi&s;hop has already ac|quainted you with the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed ju&s;t now, between Lady Clementina and me.</P>
<P>They were &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Has not your Lady&s;hip &s;een Lady Clementina &s;ince?</P>
<P>I have: And &s;he is extremely unea&s;y. She wi&s;hes you could be of our religion. Could it have been &s;o, I, for my part, &s;hould rather have called the Che|valier Grandi&s;on my &s;on, than any man in the world. Clementina told me, added &s;he (I cannot but &s;ay with more compo&s;ure than I could have expected tho' not without tears) that you promi&s;ed to urge her no more on this &s;ubject. She owns, that more than once, as you talked to her, &s;he could hardly forbear giving you her hand, on your own terms. But &s;he &s;ays, that you were the mo&s;t generous of men, when you &s;aw &s;he made a point of con&s;cience of her adhe|rence to her newly-taken re&s;olution. And now, Che|valier, having made my Lord and the Count acquaint|ed with all the&s;e things, we are come to advi&s;e with you what is to be done.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Marquis, advi&s;e us. We want an opportunity to &s;hew you, in more than words, our gratitude for all your goodne&s;s to us: We want to appea&s;e our Jeronymo; who is ready to &s;u&s;pect, that his Brother and Father Mare&s;cotti have contri|buted to this turn in our daughter's mind: And we want you to declare freely your own &s;entiments, with regard to Clementina; and whether you would advi&s;e us, as well for her own &s;ake, as for yours, to endea|vour
<PB N="186" REF="187">
to prevail on her to change her mind. Dear creature! a relap&s;e would now be fatal to her, and to her mother and me.</P>
<P>I have no difficulty, my Lord, to an&s;wer to the&s;e points. As to the fir&s;t, I am greatly rewarded by the plea&s;ure I have, in the more than could be hoped-for happy effects of Mr. Lowther's &s;kill; and in the pro|&s;pects that open to us of Lady Clementina's re&s;tored health of mind. On this &s;ubject I have but one re|que&s;t to make: It is that you will not mortify me &s;o much, as to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that I am not &s;ufficiently re|warded.</P>
<P>As to appea&s;ing the generous mind of Signor Jero|nymo, let that ta&s;k be Lady Clementina's. She can plead con&s;cience with more force for her&s;elf, than any &s;econd per&s;on can do for her; and if &s;he does, it will be a demon&s;tration to us all, of her being likely to be happy in her per&s;everance!&mdash;More happy than I &s;hall be! The admirable Lady who has &s;ilenced, on this head, a man &s;o deeply intere&s;ted to conte&s;t this point with her, will certainly be able to appea&s;e a brother by the &s;ame pleas; and the &s;ooner, as, being of the &s;ame religion with the lovely pleader, her arguments will have greater force with <HI>him,</HI> than they could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have on <HI>me.</HI> For, let me &s;ay, my Lord, that I could not &s;o much as <HI>&s;eem</HI> to give way to them, had I not been accu&s;tomed, when I was to judge of another's actions, to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf that very per&s;on: Hence have I often thought my&s;elf obliged to give judgement again&s;t my own wi&s;hes; though, on re&s;ume|ing MYSELF, I have not found rea&s;on to di&s;approve of my fir&s;t expectation.</P>
<P>As to the third point, what can I &s;ay?&mdash;And yet, as your Lord&s;hip has put it, does it not <HI>call</HI> upon me, as I may &s;ay, to give a <HI>proof</HI> of the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s I have mentioned? I an&s;wer then, as &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf in <HI>your</HI> &s;ituation&mdash;I cannot expect that you will urge an intere&s;t, which I, by having put my&s;elf into that
<PB N="187" REF="188">
of Lady Clementina, have promi&s;ed <HI>not</HI> to urge, un|le&s;s &s;he change her mind. What plea can a parent make u&s;e of, but that of <HI>filial duty?</HI> And where the child can plead <HI>con&s;cience</HI> in an&s;wer, ought it to be in|&s;i&s;ted on?</P>
<P>And now, re&s;uming MYSELF, let me pre&s;ume to advi&s;e you to give the dear Lady full time to con&s;ider and <HI>re</HI>-con&s;ider the ca&s;e. Her imagination may be heated: In other words, her malady may have a &s;hare in the heroi&s;m &s;he has &s;o nobly exerted: And yet I am afraid &s;he will per&s;evere. Permit me, my Lords, to &s;ay <HI>afraid.</HI> I cannot wholly dive&s;t my&s;elf of Self, in this very affecting ca&s;e. We will not therefore take her at her word: I will ab&s;ent my&s;elf for &s;ome time from Bologna; but (as &s;he has the goodne&s;s to ac|knowlege an e&s;teem for me) with her leave. I will return at my time. I will <HI>repeat</HI> my ab&s;ences, if we have the lea&s;t &s;hadow of doubt. But if &s;he hold her purpo&s;e, and &s;hall not be vi&s;ibly wor&s;e in her health or mind, we may conclude her re&s;olution unalterable. In this ca&s;e, I &s;hall have one or two reque&s;ts to make you; and, if granted, will endeavour to make my&s;elf as happy as a man in &s;uch a &s;ituation can be.</P>
<P>They applauded my advice. They declared them|&s;elves unwilling to think of giving up the plea&s;ure they had brought them&s;elves to have, in con&s;idering me as one of their family; and a&s;&s;ured me, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible, that any the lea&s;t difficulty &s;hould have ari&s;en from them, after they had brought them|&s;elves to di&s;pen&s;e with the mo&s;t material one.</P>
<P>They were earne&s;t with me to pa&s;s the evening with them. But I excu&s;ed my&s;elf. I wanted to be at my own lodgings, in order to revolve all that had pa&s;&s;ed. But having not taken leave of Lady Clementina, I imagined &s;he might think I went away in ill humour, if I forbore it. My whole &s;tudy, I told them, &s;hould be to make Lady Clementina ea&s;y: And if the Marchio|ne&s;s
<PB N="188" REF="189">
would be &s;o good as to permit me to take leave of her for the evening, in her pre&s;ence, I would depart; only making my compliment to Signor Jeronymo, by Mr. Lowther; knowing that he would be grieved for my di&s;appointment; and my mind not being at pre|&s;ent ea&s;y enough, to contend with his concern for me.</P>
<P>The Michione&s;s &s;aid, &s;he would &s;ee the way her Clementina was then in; and acquaint me, by Ca|milla, with her wi&s;hes; and then withdrew; leaving the Marquis, the Count, and me together.</P>
<P>Before we could renew our di&s;cour&s;e, the Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti joined us; both in high &s;pirits. They were exce&s;&s;ively complai&s;ant to me. It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s at the occa&s;ion of their good humour. I could not be greatly delighted with it. But when the Count told them what had pa&s;&s;ed, before they joined us, the Bi&s;hop embraced me; the Father un|awares &s;natched my hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>I was glad to be relieved from their compliments, by the expected me&s;&s;age from the Marchione&s;s and Clementina.</P>
<P>The young Lady met me, as I entered at the door of her apartment. She held out her hand to me. I re&s;pectfully took it. I &s;aw &s;he had been in tears: But &s;he looked with a &s;erenity, that I was glad to &s;ee, tho' I doubted not but it was partly owing to the conver|&s;ation &s;he had had &s;ince I left her, with her brother and her confe&s;&s;or, as well as to what might have pa&s;&s;ed between her mother and her.</P>
<P>She led me to a chair between them both. She withdrew not her hand; and aimed at a more chear|ful countenance than I had a heart. I congratulated her on her &s;erenity. It is in your power, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, to make me &s;till more &s;erene&mdash;Can you, of a truth, and from your heart, approve of my pre&s;ent way of thinking? <HI>Can</HI> you, Chevalier?&mdash;</P>
<P>I can admire you for it, madam! You have ex|alted your&s;elf, in my opinion. But I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> regret it&mdash;
<PB N="189" REF="190">
Becau&s;e&mdash;But I have promi&s;ed not to urge you. Your con&s;cience, madam, is concerned&mdash;To endeavour but to <HI>per&s;uade</HI> again&s;t con&s;cience, if you have no doubt of your motive, is not warranted, even in a parent.</P>

<P>She &s;till &s;uffered me to with-hold her hand; and with the other took out her handkerchief; not to wipe away her tears, but to hide her blu&s;hes. She wept not: Her bo&s;om heaved with the grandeur of her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, my dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Mar|chione&s;s, is this&mdash;We have all of us told my Clemen|tina, that you are invincible on the article of religion. She believes <HI>us:</HI> She doubts it not from your <HI>behaviour</HI> and <HI>words:</HI> But as &s;he would not omit any means to convince you of her high regard for you, &s;he is de|&s;irous to hear from your own lips, that you are <HI>not</HI> to be convinced: She is not afraid, the article &s;o impor|tant, to hear you declare, that you will not be a Ca|tholic. It will make her more ea&s;y upon reflexion, to be told by you <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> that you <HI>cannot</HI> comply, even were &s;he to con&s;ent to be yours, at a very &s;hort day, if you <HI>could</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The exalted Lady &s;tood up, &s;till not withdrawing her hand&mdash;Fal&s;e &s;hame, I de&s;pi&s;e thee, &s;aid &s;he: Yet, covered with blu&s;hes, &s;he turned her face from me.&mdash;That hand, as this heart, putting her other hand to her throbbing bo&s;om, is yours, on that one condi|tion&mdash;I am convinced of your affection for me&mdash;But fear not to tell me (it is for my own future peace of mind, that I a&s;k it) that you cannot accept it on the terms. She then withdrew her hand, and would have gone from me: But again I &s;natched it with both mine.</P>
<P>Do <HI>you,</HI> mo&s;t excellent of human beings, let me

<P>O madam! But I mu&s;t fir&s;t try to quiet my own.</P>
<P>I withdrew into the room adjoining; and, in two or three minutes, returning, found the lovely daughter incircled by the arms of the indulgent mother, both in tears. Clementina was &s;peaking. The&s;e were the words I heard her &s;ay:</P>
<P>Indeed, my deare&s;t mamma, I am <HI>not</HI> angry with the Chevalier. Why &s;hould I? But he can allow for

He <HI>believes</HI> it is. He might urge much to his own advantage from your adherence to yours: But he has only hinted at that to us, not to you. He is willing to wait the event of your own will.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Thur&s;day, July <HI>13-24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had a vi&s;it early this morning from the Count of Belvedere. Be found me very much indi&s;po&s;ed. He had heard that I had met with &s;ome difficulties, and attributed my indi&s;po&s;ition to them.</P>
<P>I owned that it might be &s;o. My life, my Lord, &s;aid I, has not been &s;o happy as might have been hoped for, by a man, who has made it his &s;tudy to avoid giving offence, either to man or woman; and has endeavoured to re&s;train pa&s;&s;ions, that otherwi&s;e might have been as unruly as tho&s;e of other young men, in my circum&s;tances. But, I ble&s;s God, I have re&s;olution. I may bend beneath a weight, when it is <HI>fir&s;t</HI> laid upon me: But if I find I cannot &s;hake it off, I will endeavour to collect my &s;trength, and make my&s;elf ea&s;y under it. Pardon me, my Lord: I do not often allow my mind to break out thus into words. But I hold the Count of Belvedere for my friend.</P>
<P>You do me honour, &s;aid he: And I came with a heart di&s;po&s;ed to cultivate your friend&s;hip. I thank you for your la&s;t goodne&s;s to me. Your advice and gentle behaviour, when I was not fit to be tru&s;ted with my&s;elf, have &s;aved me, as far as I know, from
<PB N="193" REF="194">
final de&s;truction. To the la&s;t day of my life, I &s;hall confe&s;s obligation to you. But, dear Chevalier, if &s;ome account of the difficulties you meet with will not be a renewal of grief, now you are not very well&mdash;</P>
<P>It will <HI>not</HI> be &s;o, my Lord, interrupted I, &s;ince at pre&s;ent I can think of nothing el&s;e. Yet putting my|&s;elf in the place of every one of the family of Porretta, I have nobody to blame; but the contrary. And I mu&s;t admire Lady Clementina as one of the noble&s;t of women.</P>
<P>He was all impatience for further particulars.</P>
<P>What may yet be the event, I cannot tell, pro|ceeded I: Therefore will only &s;ay, that difference in religion is the difficulty with the Lady. I am willing to allow her the full and free exerci&s;e of hers. She in&s;i&s;ts upon a change of mine. For the re&s;t, you, my Lord, want not friends among the principals of the family; let <HI>them</HI> give you what account they think fit. I would not &s;cruple to gratify your curio&s;ity, could I give you a conclu&s;ive one.</P>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> curious, Chevalier, &s;aid he. I loved Clemen|tina above all women, <HI>before</HI> her illne&s;s. I loved her not the le&s;s <HI>for</HI> her illne&s;s; for then my Pity joined with my Love, and added a tenderne&s;s to it, of which I had not, in equal degree, been before &s;en&s;ible. The treatment &s;he met with, and the &s;elf-intere&s;ted cruelty of Lady Laurana, heightened her illne&s;s, and that (I did not think it po&s;&s;ible) my Love. In order to free her from that treatment; and in hopes that a dif|ferent one (my hopes you &s;ee were not ill founded) would re&s;tore her rea&s;on; and that the happy re&s;ult might be the defeating of the cruel Laurana's expect|ations; I tender'd my&s;elf in marriage to her, not|with&s;tanding her illne&s;s. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I never knew how much I loved her, till I was apprehen&s;ive that, not only I, but Italy, and her Religion, were likely to lo&s;e her for ever. And will you not allow of my curio&s;ity now? God give you, Chevalier, health
<PB N="194" REF="195">
and happine&s;s here and hereafter! But may you never be the hu&s;band of Clementina, but of &s;ome woman of your own country, if there be one in it that can de&s;erve you!</P>
<P>The Count left me with this wi&s;h, pronounced with earne&s;tne&s;s: And I &s;uppo&s;e will vi&s;it the Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti, in order to gratify his cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>My indi&s;po&s;ition requiring indulgence, I &s;ent a billet to the Marchione&s;s, excu&s;ing my attendance till the afternoon, on the &s;core of an unexpected engage|ment. I was loth to mention that I was not very well, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought a lover-like artifice, to move compa&s;&s;ion. I will not owe my &s;ucce&s;s, even with a Clementina, to mean contrivances. You know I have pride, my dear friend&mdash;Pride which your example has not been able to &s;ubdue, tho' it has &s;ometimes made me a&s;hamed of it.</P>

<P>CAMILLA, by direction of her two Ladies, made me a vi&s;it about two hours ago. They were alarmed at my po&s;tponing my attendance on Lady Clementina till the afternoon; &s;u&s;pecting that the Count of Bel|vedere had unwelcomely engaged me; and therefore &s;ent the worthy woman to know the true cau&s;e. Ca|milla ob&s;erving that I looked ill, I de&s;ired her to take no notice of it to any-body: But &s;he could not help acquainting the Marchione&s;s with it; who, ordering her to forbear mentioning it to Clementina and Je|ronymo, was &s;o good, attended by Father Mare&s;cotti, to make me a vi&s;it in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Never was mother more tender to her own &s;on, than &s;he was to me. The Father expre&s;&s;ed a paternal affection for me. I made light of the illne&s;s, being re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to attend them in the afternoon. My mind, my dear friend, is di&s;turbed. I want to be at a certainty: Yet, from what the Marchione&s;s hinted, I believe I have no rea&s;on to doubt. The

Father and the Bi&s;hop have &s;pared no pains, I dare &s;ay, to &s;trengthen the Lady's &s;cruples. Their whole &s;tudy (the Marchione&s;s intimated) is now, in what menner to acknowlege their obligations to me.</P>
<P>They owe me none.</P>
<P>My dear Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, at parting, take care of your health: She put her hand on mine&mdash;Your <HI>precious</HI> health. Don't think of coming out. We will in turn attend you here.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the advice of the Marchio|ne&s;s, I went to the palace of Porretta, as &s;oon as I thought their dinner-time was over. Signor Jeronymo de&s;ired to be alone with me for a few minutes; and when he was, began upon the &s;ubject of the unex|pected turn which his &s;i&s;ter had taken. I found, that he had been acquainted with the truth of every-thing: Not a &s;ingle circum&s;tance was omitted, that might enable him to judge fairly of the whole.</P>
<P>And will you, Grandi&s;on, <HI>can</HI> you, my dear friend, &s;aid he, have the goodne&s;s to attend with patience the event of this dear girl's heroi&s;m, or what &s;hall I call it?</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, that the re&s;toration of his &s;i&s;ter's health of mind was the deare&s;t to me of all con&s;iderations; and that I came over at fir&s;t with no other hopes than <HI>his</HI> recovery and <HI>hers;</HI> re&s;olved to leave to Providence all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s came in &s;oon after, and taking me a&s;ide, chid me with tenderne&s;s even maternal, for coming abroad. The Marquis, the Count, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, joined us; and then they all, as with one voice, offered to u&s;e their intere&s;ts with Clementina in my favour, if either my peace of mind, or my health, were likely to be affected by her pre&s;ent re&s;olution.</P>
<P>While there was <HI>con&s;cience</HI> in it, I an&s;wered, I would not, for the world, that &s;he &s;hould be urged to change
<PB N="196" REF="197">
it. Nothing now, as I believed, remained to be done, but to try the firmne&s;s of her re&s;olution, by fir&s;t &s;hort, and then longer ab&s;ences: And tho&s;e I would pro|po&s;e to her&s;elf, if they thought fit, when I was next admitted to her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Jeronymo, and all the family, I &s;aw were of one mind. Tell me, <HI>&s;ay,</HI> my dear Dr. Bartlett, is it ex|cu&s;able in a man, who has been &s;o long favoured by your conver&s;ation, and <HI>&s;hould</HI> have been benefited by your example, who have behaved &s;o greatly in di&s;ap|pointments, and even per&s;ecutions, to find in him&s;elf a pride that, at the in&s;tant, had almo&s;t carried him into petulance, when he &s;aw every one of this family appear to be more plea&s;ed than di&s;plea&s;ed, that he was not likely to be allied to them?&mdash;Who yet, when he coolly con&s;iders, and puts him&s;elf in the ca&s;e of each individual of it, mu&s;t acknowlege, that they might well be allowed to rejoice (the great article of religion <HI>out</HI> of the que&s;tion) in the hope of keeping her among them in her native country; and the more, becau&s;e of the unhappy di&s;order of her mind; and out of a di&s;tant one, obnoxious to them all, as England is? Would not my own father and mother, would not I my&s;elf, have equally rejoiced in &s;uch a turn in the affections of a &s;i&s;ter of my own; e&s;pecially if we had complied with her principally from motives of compa&s;&s;ion, and contrary to the intere&s;ts of our family?</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s conducted me to the young Lady. She received me with a blu&s;h, as a per&s;on would do another whom &s;he was &s;en&s;ible &s;he had cau&s;ele&s;ly di&s;|appointed. She took notice, after the fir&s;t emotion, that I &s;eemed not to be well, and ca&s;t an eye of com|pa&s;&s;ion on me. A &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition, I &s;aid, that might, perhaps, be owing to my late inactivity, and want of exerci&s;e. I had thoughts of once more mak|ing the tour of Italy, in order to vi&s;it the many kind friends at different Courts, who had honoured me with their notice during my former abode in Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">
How long do you propo&s;e to be ab&s;ent, Sir?</P>
<P>Perhaps a month, madam.</P>
<P>A month, Sir!&mdash;She &s;ighed, and looked down.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo, I hope, &s;aid I, will corre&s;pond with me.</P>
<P>I could almo&s;t wi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Pardon me, madam, to her mother&mdash;and looked ba&s;hfully down.</P>
<P>What would my child wi&s;h?</P>
<P>That <HI>I</HI> might corre&s;pond with the Chevalier in his ab&s;ence&mdash;As his <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> as his <HI>pupil,</HI> I think I might&mdash;</P>
<P>You will do me, madam, the highe&s;t honour&mdash;Dear madam, to the Marchione&s;s, may I not have your <HI>intere&s;t</HI> with Lady Clementina, to engage her to pur&s;ue her kind hint?</P>
<P>By all means. My deare&s;t Love, it will not mi&s;|become you in <HI>any</HI> character, whether as pupil, as &s;i&s;ter, or friend, to write to &s;uch a man as the Chevalier Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Perhaps then I may, &s;aid &s;he. You, madam, &s;hall &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es in this corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>That &s;hall be as you plea&s;e, my Love. I can ab|&s;olutely depend upon the Chevalier's genero&s;ity, and your prudence.</P>
<P>I &s;hould <HI>choo&s;e,</HI> madam, &s;aid I, that you &s;hould &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es. As amu&s;ement is principally my view in this tour, I can be punctual to place and time.</P>
<P>But &s;hall you be gone a month, Sir?</P>
<P>As much le&s;s, madam, as you &s;hall command.</P>
<P>Nay, as things are circum&s;tanced, it is not for me&mdash;She &s;topt, &s;ighed, and looked down.</P>
<P>You, madam, are above unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;erve. I never yet abu&s;ed a confidence. I am proud of your good opinion. I never will do any-thing to forfeit it. What|ever &s;hall be your plea&s;ure, <HI>that</HI> &s;ignify to me in the Letters you will favour me with. I will be all grateful obedience.</P>
<P>Whither, Sir, do you intend to go fir&s;t?</P>
<P>To Florence, madam&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">
To Florence, Sir?&mdash;But Lady Olivia, I think, is <HI>not</HI> there&mdash;To Mrs. Beaumont, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P>I will &s;end you, madam, from Florence, the be|ginning Letter of the hoped-for corre&s;pondence. I will be careful to be within di&s;tance of receiving your favour in a very &s;hort &s;pace, by means of a &s;ervant, whom I will leave at Florence, to attend to our cor|re&s;pondence.</P>
<P>And when, Sir, do you leave Bologna?</P>
<P>I will now take leave of my new corre&s;pondent, and my dear friends here; and di&s;po&s;e my&s;elf for my little route.</P>
<P>She looked at her mother: then at me&mdash;again &s;ighed, blu&s;hed, and looked down&mdash;<HI>Well, Sir,</HI> was all &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Will you not drink chocolate with us to-morrow? &s;aid the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>I excu&s;ed my&s;elf. As I was not well, I thought I <HI>might</HI> be obliged to keep my chamber for two or three days; and that therefore it was better to take leave of her then, that I might not give them anxiety, for their own &s;akes, on a &s;uppo&s;al, that I owed my indi&s;po&s;ition to my di&s;appointment. And yet, Dr. Bartlett&mdash;But you know my heart, and all its imperfections: And will you not, on this extraordinary occa&s;ion, allow me to give way to my native pride, for my own &s;ake? Who but mu&s;t admire the exalted mind of this young Lady? What man would not wi&s;h her to be his?&mdash;But to covet a relation to a family, however illu&s;trious, however worthy, every one of which wi&s;hes, and with <HI>rea&s;on</HI> on his &s;ide, that it may not take place&mdash;I mu&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;But a few weeks will now determine my fate&mdash;I will not leave <HI>them</HI> or <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if I can help it, any cau&s;e of regret.</P>
<P>I took a &s;olemn leave of Clementina. She wept at parting; and dropping down on one knee, prayed for a ble&s;&s;ing to attend me where-ever I went.</P>
<P>Even had <HI>not</HI> my indi&s;po&s;ition lowered my &s;pirits,

<P>I went from her to Jeronymo. I left it to his mo|ther to tell him all that had pa&s;&s;ed; and took almo&s;t as ardent a leave of him. I de&s;ired a vi&s;it from Mr. Lowther: And left my compliments for the re&s;t of a family that I ever mu&s;t highly re&s;pect.</P>

<P>I TOOK, by advice, a medicine over-night, that compo&s;ed me. I had wanted re&s;t. I am much better, and preparing for my journey to Florence. I have re|turned an&s;wer that I <HI>am,</HI> to enquiries made after my health by the whole family. The Bi&s;hop excu&s;ed his per&s;onal attendance, on the Count's &s;udden re&s;olution to &s;et out for Urbino; and in&s;i&s;ting on his and Father Mare&s;cotti's accompanying him thither for a few days.</P>
<P>Camilla came to me from her two Ladies, and the Marquis. All three, &s;he told me, were indi&s;po&s;ed. Their enquiries after my health were very tender: The Marquis bid her tell me, that he hoped to be well enough to make me a vi&s;it before I &s;et out. Jeronymo wi&s;hed to &s;ee me fir&s;t, if I had opportunity. But, as I probably mu&s;t, if I go, &s;ee Lady Clementina, and another &s;olemn parting will follow, I think it will be be&s;t, for <HI>both</HI> our &s;akes, as well as for Jeronymo's, not to obey him; and &s;o I hinted by Camilla.</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere has made me a vi&s;it. He is &s;etting out for Parma. Not one word pa&s;&s;ed his lips about Lady Clementina, or her family. He was very earne&s;t with me, to promi&s;e him a vi&s;it at his palace. I gave him room to expect me. By his &s;ilence on a &s;ubject &s;o near his heart, as well as by the very great re&s;pect he paid me, I have no rea&s;on to doubt but he knows the &s;ituation I am in with Clementina: <HI>She</HI> will have <HI>his</HI> prayers, I dare &s;ay, for per&s;everance in her pre&s;ent way of thinking. Indeed now, <HI>every|body</HI>'s of her family&mdash;for who can doubt the Gene|ral's?
<PB N="200" REF="201">
She would have had <HI>mine</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, the more &s;incerely, had not they all joined to indulge my hopes; and had &s;he not given &s;uch in&s;tances of the noble&s;t of female minds.</P>
<P>But, how great &s;oever may be the occa&s;ion given me for fortitude, by a re&s;olution &s;o unexpected by eve|ry-body from Lady Clementina, I cannot be deprived of all plea&s;ure; &s;ince the contents of my la&s;t pacquets, as well tho&s;e from Paris as from England, afford me a great deal.</P>
<P>Every-thing is done at Paris, that I could have wi&s;hed, in relation to Mr. Danby's legacy.</P>
<P>Lord W. lets me know, that he thinks him&s;elf every day happier than in the pa&s;t with his Lady; who al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribes to the &s;ame acknowledgment.</P>
<P>Our Beauchamp tells me, that he wants only my company to make him the happie&s;t of men. He re|que&s;ts me to write a Letter of thanks, in my own name, to Lady Beauchamp, on his dutiful acknow|ledgment to me of her kindne&s;s to him. I will with plea&s;ure comply; and the &s;ooner, as I am &s;ure that gratitude for pa&s;t benefits, and not expectation of new ones, is his motive.</P>
<P>He laments in po&s;t&s;cript, that his father is taken with a threatening di&s;order. I am &s;orry for it. Me|thinks I am intere&s;ted in the life and health of Sir Harry Beauchamp. I hope he will long enjoy the happine&s;s, of which his &s;on &s;ays he is extremely &s;en|&s;ible. Should he die, the Lady will be a great deal in my Beauchamp's power, large as her jointure is. If he be not, on &s;uch an event, as obliging to her, as he now is, and forget not all pa&s;t di&s;obligations, I &s;hall not have the opinion of his heart that I now have. Our Beauchamp wants but the trial of pro&s;perity (a much more arduous one than that of adver&s;ity) to be upon full proof an excellent man.</P>
<P>Lady Mansfield, with equal joy and gratitude, ac|quaints me, that my pre&s;ence in England is only
<PB N="201" REF="202">
wanting to bring to a deci&s;ion every point that now remains in debate with her adver&s;aries, the Keelings; they having &s;hewn them&s;elves inclinable, by the me|diation of Sir John Lambton, to compromi&s;e on the terms I had advi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould get propo&s;ed, as from me; and the wicked Bolton having al&s;o made pro|po&s;als, that perhaps ought to be accepted if he cannot be brought to amend them.</P>
<P>Two of Emily's Letters of di&s;tant date are come together. I will write to the dear girl by the next mail, and let her know how much ab&s;ence endears to me my friends.</P>
<P>You give me joy my dear Dr. Bartlett, in acquaint|ing me with the happine&s;s of Lord and Lady G. I will write to my Charlotte upon it, and thank her for the credit &s;he does me by her affectionate beha|viour to that hone&s;t and obliging man.</P>
<P>How happy are you, my dear friend, and Lord and Lady G. and Emily, at Mi&s;s Byron's! I am charmed with the characters you give me of her family.</P>
<P>But I have Letters brought by the &s;ame mail, that are not &s;o agreeable as tho&s;e I have taken notice of. They are from Lady Olivia, and my poor cou&s;in Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>That unhappy woman <HI>is</HI> to be my di&s;turbance! She is preparing, &s;he &s;ays, to come back to Italy. She execrates: She threatens. Poor woman! But no more of her at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in is by this time, I &s;uppo&s;e, at Paris. He writes, that he was on the point of &s;etting out, in pur|&s;uance of my advice; and will wait there for my direction to proceed to Italy, or not. I &s;hall write to him to continue there till he hears further from me; and, at the &s;ame time, to &s;ome of my friends there, to make France agreeable to him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not perhaps write again very &s;oon. Letters from England will, however, find an ea&s;y acce&s;s, di|rected to me, under cover, to Mrs. Beaumont at Florence, as you know how.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
I &s;hall be pretty much in motion, if health permit. I &s;hall take a view of the works projecting by the duke of Modena, in order to render his little Signory con|&s;iderable. I &s;hall vi&s;it the Count of Belvedere at Parma. Mrs. Beaumont and her friends will have more of my company than any other per&s;ons. Per|haps I may make a long-reque&s;ted vi&s;it to the Altieri family, at Urbino. If I do, I mu&s;t not put a &s;light on the Conte della Porretta, who pre&s;&s;ingly invited me thither. I think to pa&s;s a few days at Rome. If I go from thence to Naples, I &s;hall perhaps once more, in the General's company, vi&s;it Portici, in order to make more accurate ob&s;ervations than I have hitherto done, on tho&s;e trea&s;ures of antiquity which have been di&s;covered in the antient Herculaneum.</P>
<P>I have a private intimation from Milan, that a vi&s;it there would be a welcome one to Lady Sforza. I may po&s;&s;ibly take that city in my way, when I quit Italy. But how can I, without indignation, &s;ee the cruel Laurana?</P>
<P>Thus, my dear and reverend friend, have I given you an imperfect &s;ketch of my pre&s;ent intentions, as to pa&s;&s;ing the month that I think of ab&s;enting my&s;elf from Bologna.</P>
<P>It is a long time &s;ince I have been able to tell you aforehand, with regard to &s;ome of the mo&s;t material articles of my life, what I <HI>will</HI> or will <HI>not</HI> do. Yet, knowing my own motives, I cannot &s;ay, that were the la&s;t three or four years of it to come over again, I &s;hould have acted otherwi&s;e than I have done. Do you, my reverend friend, with that freedom which has been of inexpre&s;&s;ible u&s;e to me, remind me, if I am too ready to acquit my&s;elf. You know (I repeat) all the &s;ecrets of my heart. Be not partial to your &s;incere friend. I write not to be prai&s;ed, but corrected, Don't flatter my vanity; I am yet but a young man! You have not blamed me a great while: I am for this rea&s;on a little diffident of the ground I &s;tand upon:
<PB N="203" REF="204">
But if you have no <HI>material</HI> fault to recollect, &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of telling me &s;o: Having thus re|newed my call upon you, for your friendly admoni|tion, I will look upon your &s;ilence as an acquittal, &s;o far as I have gone. And we will begin, from the date of your next, a new account. In the mean time, he not concerned for my health. I am much better than I was. My mind was weakened by &s;u&s;pen&s;e. I long &s;ince thought the cri&s;is near. If it be not already overpa&s;t, a few weeks mu&s;t &s;urely determine it. I am not in ha&s;te to &s;end this pacquet.

<P>TELL you my dear Lady G. all I think of the contents of the pacquet you &s;o kindly &s;ent me by an expre&s;s me&s;&s;enger!&mdash;What will you &s;ay to me, if I do? I can much better tell you, what all my <HI>friends</HI> here &s;ay of them. They are for congratulating me upon tho&s;e contents. But can I congratulate <HI>my&s;elf?</HI> Can I <HI>receive</HI> their congratulations? A woman! an angel!&mdash;So much more worthy of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, than the poor Harriet Byron can be!&mdash;O how great is Clementina, how little am I, in my own eyes! The Lady will &s;till be his. She mu&s;t. She &s;hall. She will change her mind. So earne&s;t he! So fervently in love with him, &s;he! Who will pre&s;ume to hope a place in his affections after her? My pride, my dear, is all up! Can I? How mean will any one now appear in his eyes, when he thinks of his Clementina? And who can be contented with half a heart? Nay, <HI>not</HI> half a one, if he does ju&s;tice to this wonder of a wo|man? It was always my con&s;olation, when I looked upon him as lo&s;t to my&s;elf, that it was to a per&s;on of &s;uperior merit.</P>
<P>But who can forbear pitying the glorious man! O my dear, I am lo&s;t in the &s;ubject! I know not what to &s;ay. Were I to tell you what I thought, what were my emotions, as I read now his generous pity for the Count of Belvedere&mdash;Now his affectionate and
<PB N="205" REF="206">
re&s;pectful addre&s;s to the noble Lady&mdash;Her agitations of mind, previous to the delivery of her paper to him&mdash;That paper, the contents &s;o greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all that I had read of woman! Yet &s;o much of a piece with the conduct &s;he &s;hewed, when the &s;truggle between her Religion and her Love co&s;t her her rea&s;on. His delicacy, yet equal &s;teadine&s;s, in his religion&mdash;In &s;hort, the whole of his conduct and hers, in the various lights in which they appeared in the different conver&s;ations with her, with her family&mdash;Were I to tell you, I &s;ay, what I thought, and what were my emotions, as I read, a volume would not be &s;ufficient; nor know I what mea&s;ure would contain my tears. Suffice it to &s;ay, that I was not able to ri&s;e in two days and nights; and it has been with the greate&s;t difficulty, that I obtained pen and ink, and leave to write; and the phy&s;ician talks of confining me to my chamber for a week to come.</P>
<P>Sir Charles cries out upon &s;u&s;pence. Indeed it is a grievous thing.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that in the&s;e la&s;t Letters he men|tions me but once; and that is, in making me a com|pliment on the favour which the beloved <HI>Four</HI> confer|red upon me, and all of us, in the vi&s;it you were &s;o good as to make us. And why do you think I take notice of this?&mdash;Not from petulance, I a&s;&s;ure you: But for the prai&s;e of his ju&s;tice as well as delicacy. For could Sir Charles Grandi&s;on excu&s;ably (if, on <HI>other</HI> occa&s;ions he remembred the poor girl whom he re&s;cued; could he excu&s;ably, I &s;ay) while his &s;oul was agitated by his own &s;u&s;pence, occa&s;ioned by the uncommon greatne&s;s of Clementina's behaviour, think of any other woman in the world?</P>
<P>But you &s;ee, my Charlotta, that the excellent man <HI>has been,</HI> perhaps <HI>is,</HI> greatly indi&s;po&s;ed. Can we won|der at it? Such a prize in view, &s;o many difficulties overcome, as he had to &s;truggle with; yet, at la&s;t, a &s;eemingly in&s;uperable one ari&s;ing from the Lady her|&s;elf,
<PB N="206" REF="207">
and from motives that increa&s;ed his admiration of her? But a woman may be eloquent, from grief and di&s;appointment; when a man, though his nobler heart is torn in pieces, mu&s;t hardly complain!&mdash;How do I pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a manly heart!</P>
<P>But &s;hould this noble Lady, on his return to Bologna, after a month's ab&s;ence, hold her purpo&s;e, unle&s;s he changes his religion, I will tell you my thoughts of what will probably be the re&s;ult. He will not marry at all. If he cannot love another woman, as well as he does Clementina, <HI>ought</HI> he? And who can equally de&s;erve his Love? Have we not heard from him&s;elf, as well as from Dr. Bartlett, that all the troubles he has had, have proceeded from our Sex? It is true, that men and women can hardly ever have any <HI>great</HI> troubles, but what mu&s;t ari&s;e from each other.

<P>But, &s;ick or well, you &s;ee Sir Charles Grandi&s;on lo&s;es not his &s;pirit. His enlarged heart can rejoice in the happine&s;s of his friends. I <HI>will</HI> have joy, &s;aid he once to me.

And in the happine&s;s tho&s;e recoveries mu&s;t give to a worthy and illu&s;trious family? Let me enumerate, from him, the plea&s;ure he enjoys, in the felicity he has given to ma|ny; tho' he cannot be, in him&s;elf, the happy per&s;on he makes others. Is he not delighted with the hap|pine&s;s of Lord and Lady W.? Of his Beauchamp, and his Beauchamp's father and mother?&mdash;Of Lady Mansfield, and her family? With yours and Lord G's happine&s;s?

<P>I Begin, dear and admirable Lady Clementina, the permitted corre&s;pondence, with a due &s;en&s;e of the favour done me in it: Yet, can I &s;ay, that it is not a painful favour?

Am I other than you ever had rea&s;on to think me, in my manners, in my principles? Did I ever endeavour to un&s;ettle you in your attachments to the religion of your country? No, madam: Invin|cibly attached as I knew you were to that religion, I contented my&s;elf with avowing my own; and indeed &s;hould have thought it an ill requital for the protection I enjoyed from the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers, and a breach of the Laws of ho&s;pitality, had I attempted to un&s;ettle the beloved daughter of a hou&s;e &s;o firmly likewi&s;e attached, as they always were, to their prin|ciples.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Tue&s;day, Aug. <HI>5.</HI> N. S.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Was the more willing, Sir, to become your cor|re&s;pondent, as I thought I could write to you with greater freedom, than I could &s;peak. And in|deed I will be very free, and very &s;incere, in all I &s;hall write. I will &s;uppo&s;e, that I am writing, when I write to you, to my Brother, and be&s;t friend. And indeed to which of my <HI>other</HI> brothers can I write, with equal freedom?&mdash;You, in imitation of the God of us all, require only the heart. My heart &s;hall be as open to you, as if, like Him, you could look into every &s;e|cret rece&s;s of it.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, for the kind and generous con|tents of the Letter, by which you have opened this de|&s;irable corre&s;pondence. Such a regard have you paid in it to the weakne&s;s of my mind, and to its late un|happy &s;tate, without mentioning that unhappy &s;tate&mdash;O Sir, you are the mo&s;t delicate of men&mdash;What ten|derne&s;s have you always &s;hewn me, for my attach|ment to the religion of my fathers&mdash;Surely, you are the mo&s;t pious of Prote&s;tants!&mdash;Prote&s;tants <HI>can</HI> be pi|ous;
<PB N="211" REF="212">
you and Mrs. Beaumont have convinced me that they can. Little did I think I &s;hould ever be brought to acknowlege &s;o much in favour of the people of your religion, as you and &s;he, by your goodne&s;s, have brought me to acknowlege. O Sir! What might you not have brought me to, by your Love, by your kind treatment of me, and by your irre&s;i&s;table addre&s;s, were I to have been yours, and re&s;iding in a Prote&s;tant na|tion, every one of your friends of that religion, and all amiable, and perhaps <HI>exemplarily</HI> good? I was <HI>afraid</HI> of you, Chevalier. But no more of this &s;ubject. <HI>You</HI> are invincible; and I hope <HI>I</HI> &s;hould not have been overcome, had I been yours&mdash;But do we not pray again&s;t running into temptation?&mdash;Again, I &s;ay, no more of this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, yet hardly know how to forbear&mdash;</P>
<P>Nothing but the due con&s;ideration of the brevity as well as vanity of this life, in which we are but pro|bationers, and of the eternity of the next, could have influenced me to act again&s;t my heart: Dear Cheva|lier, how happy &s;hould I have been, could I have given my hand as that heart would have directed, and on &s;uch terms, as I could have thought my Soul &s;ecure?&mdash;How &s;hall I quit this entangling &s;ubject? I am in the mid&s;t of briars and thorns&mdash;Lend me, lend me, your extricating hand; and conduct me into the &s;mooth and plea&s;ant path, in which you at fir&s;t found me walking with undoubting feet. Never, never, for my &s;ake, let an unexperienced virgin tru&s;t her&s;elf with her own imagination, when &s;he begins to meditate, with plea&s;ure, the great qualities of an object, with whom &s;he has frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing.</P>
<P>Again am I recurring to a &s;ubject I wi&s;h to quit. But &s;ince I cannot, I will give my pen its cour&s;e&mdash;Pen, take thy cour&s;e. Mind, equally perver&s;e and di&s;|turbed, I will give way to thee; I &s;ee there is no with&s;tanding thee&mdash;</P>
<P>Tell me, then, my brother, my friend, my faith|ful,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
my <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> friend, what I &s;hall do, what me|thod take, to be indifferent to you, in <HI>another</HI> cha|racter? What I &s;hall do, to be able to look upon you, <HI>only</HI> as my brother and friend?&mdash;Can you not tell me? Will you not? Will not your Love of Cle|mentina permit you to tell her?&mdash;I will help you to words&mdash;Say, <Q REND="inline">"you are the friend of her <HI>Soul.</HI>"</Q> If you cannot be a Catholic <HI>always,</HI> be a Catholic when you <HI>advi&s;e</HI> her. And then, from your Love of her Soul, you will be able to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Per&s;evere, Clemen|tina! and I will not account you ungrateful"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>O Chevalier! I fear nothing &s;o much as being thought capable of ingratitude, by tho&s;e I Love. And <HI>am</HI> I not, can you think, that I am <HI>not,</HI> ungrateful? Once you told me &s;o. Why, if you mean me <HI>more</HI> than a compliment, do you not tell me how to be <HI>grateful?</HI> Are <HI>you</HI> the only man on earth, who have it in your will, and in your power, to confer obliga|tions, yet can be above receiving returns? What &s;er|vices did you endeavour to do to the Soul of a mi&s;|guided youth, at your fir&s;t acquaintance with him!&mdash;Unhappy youth! And how did he at the time requite you for them! He has let us know (generous &s;elf-ac|cu&s;er!) what heroic patience you had with him; and how bravely you di&s;dained his ungrateful defiance. Well may he love you as he does. After many, many months di&s;continuance of friend&s;hip, you were called upon to &s;natch him from the jaws of death, by your bravery. You were not requited, as you might have expected, from &s;ome of our family&mdash;What regret has the recollection co&s;t us <HI>all!</HI>&mdash;You were obliged to quit our Italy; yet, <HI>called upon,</HI> as I may &s;ay, by your wounded friend; incurably wounded, as it was ap|prehended; you ha&s;tened to him: You ha&s;tened to his &s;i&s;ter, wounded in her head, in her heart: You ha&s;tened to her father, mother, brothers, wounded in their minds, by the &s;ufferings of that &s;on and daugh|ter. And whence did you ha&s;ten to us? From your
<PB N="213" REF="214">
native country. Quitting your relations, all proud of your Love, and proud of loving you; on the wings of friendly zeal did you ha&s;ten to us, in a di&s;tant re|gion. You encountered with, you overcame, a thou|&s;and ob&s;tacles. The genius of healing, in the form of a &s;kilful operator, accompanying you; all the art of the phy&s;icians of your country did you collect, to a&s;&s;i&s;t your noble purpo&s;e. Succe&s;s attended your generous wi&s;hes. We &s;ee one another, a whole family &s;ee one another, with that delight, which was wont to irra|diate our countenances, before di&s;a&s;ter overclouded them.</P>
<P>And now, what return &s;hall we make for your goodne&s;s to us? You &s;ay, you are already rewarded in the &s;ucce&s;s with which God has ble&s;&s;ed your gene|rous endeavours to &s;erve us. Hence it is, that I call you proud, and, at the &s;ame time, happy. Well do I know, that it is not in the power of a wife to re|ward you. For what could a wife do by &s;uch a man more than her duty? And were it po&s;&s;ible for Cle|mentina to be yours, <HI>would</HI> you that your kindne&s;s, your Love to her, &s;hould be rewarded at the price of her everla&s;ting happine&s;s?&mdash;No, you an&s;wer&mdash;You would leave to her the full and free exerci&s;e of her religion&mdash;And <HI>can</HI> you promi&s;e, can you, the Che|valier Grandi&s;on, undertake, if you think your wife in an error, that you never will endeavour to cure her of that error? You who, as the hu&s;band, ought to be the regulator of her con&s;cience; the &s;trengthener of her mind&mdash;Can you, believing your own religion a right one, hers a wrong one, be contented that &s;he &s;hall per&s;evere in it? Or can &s;he avoid, on the &s;ame, and even &s;till &s;tricter principles, entering into debate with you? and will not then her faith, from your &s;u|perior under&s;tanding, be endangered?&mdash;Of what force will be my Confe&s;&s;or's arguments, again&s;t yours, &s;trengthened by your Love, your kindne&s;s, your &s;weet|ne&s;s of manners? And how will all my family grieve,

were Clementina to become indifferent to <HI>them,</HI> to her <HI>country,</HI> and <HI>more</HI> than indifferent to her religion?</P>
<P>Say, Grandi&s;on, my tutor, my friend, my brother, can you be indifferent on the&s;e weighty matters?&mdash;O no, you cannot. My brother, the Bi&s;hop, has told me (But be not angry with my brother for telling me) that you did declare to my elder brother and him, that you would not, in a <HI>beginning</HI> addre&s;s, have grant|ed to a <HI>prince&s;s</HI> the terms you were willing to grant <HI>me;</HI> and that you offered them to me as a compro|mi&s;e!&mdash;Compa&s;&s;ion and Love were equally perhaps your inducements. Poor Clementina!&mdash;Yet, were there not a <HI>greater</HI> ob&s;tacle in the way, I would have accepted of your compa&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e you are great and good; and there can be no in&s;ult, but true god|like pity, in your compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Well, Sir, and do not my father, my mother, the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of fathers and mothers; and do not my uncle, and brothers, and my other kindred; comply with their Clementina, upon the &s;ame affectionate, the &s;ame pitying motive; otherwi&s;e religion, country, the one &s;o different, the other &s;o remote, <HI>would</HI> they have con&s;ented?&mdash;They would not. Will you not then, my dear Chevalier, think that I do but right (know|ing <HI>your</HI> motive, knowing <HI>theirs,</HI> knowing that to rely upon my own &s;trength is pre&s;umption, and a tempt|ing of the Almighty) to act as I act, to re&s;olve as I have re&s;olved&mdash;O do you, my tutor, be again my tu|tor&mdash;You never taught me a le&s;&s;on that either of us might be a&s;hamed to own&mdash;Do you, as I have beg|ged of you in my paper, &s;trengthen my mind.

<P>AND do you, be&s;t of men, con&s;ent to be governed by my wi&s;hes? But are you <HI>convinced</HI> (You do not &s;ay you are) by my rea&s;onings?&mdash;Alas! my rea&s;oning powers are weakened: My head has received an in|curable wound: My memory, indeed, &s;eems returned, but its return only &s;erves to make me more &s;en&s;ible of my pa&s;t unhappine&s;s; and to dread a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>But what is it I hear? Olivia is come back to Flo|rence; and <HI>you</HI> are at Florence! Fly from Florence, and from Olivia&mdash;But whither will you go, to avoid a woman who could follow you to England?&mdash;Whi|ther, but to England?&mdash;We are all of us apprehen|&s;ive for the &s;afety of your per&s;on, if you refu&s;e to be the
<PB N="219" REF="220">
hu&s;hand of that violent woman. Yet cannot I bear the thoughts of her being yours. But <HI>that,</HI> you have told me, &s;he never can be&mdash;Yet, if you could be happy with her, why &s;hould I be an enemy to her happine&s;s?&mdash;But to your own magnanimity I will leave this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e with my tutor, my friend, my bro|ther, on a point that is now much more my concern than Olivia, and her hopes&mdash;Fain, very fain, would I take the viel. My heart is in it. My friends, my deare&s;t friends, urge again&s;t my plea, the dying re|que&s;t, as well as the wi&s;hes while living, of my grand|fathers on both &s;ides. I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; I am <HI>greatly</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for well do I know what were the views of the two good men, now with God, in wi&s;hing me <HI>not</HI> to a&s;&s;ume the viel. But could they fore&s;ee the ca|lamity that was to befal their Clementina? They could <HI>not.</HI> I need not dwell upon the &s;ubject, and upon the force of their pleas and mine, to a man who&s;e mind is capacious enough to take in the whole &s;trength of both at once. But you will add an obligation to the many you have already conferred upon me, if you can join your weight to my pleas; and make it your reque&s;t, that I may be obliged in this momentous ar|ticle. Let me expect that you can, that you will. They all langui&s;h for opportunities to oblige the man, who has laid them under obligations not to be re|turned. Need I to &s;ugge&s;t a plea to you, the force of which mu&s;t be allowed from you, if you ever with fervor loved Clementina?</P>
<P>If I know my own heart, and I have given it a &s;trict examination, two things granted me would make me as happy as I now can be in this life: The one, that my reque&s;t to be allowed to &s;eque&s;ter my&s;elf from the world, and to dedicate my&s;elf to God, be complied with: The other, to be a&s;&s;ured of your happine&s;s in marriage with an Engli&s;h, at lea&s;t not to an Italian, woman. I am obliged to own, tho' I am &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="220" REF="221">
that I expo&s;e to you my weakne&s;s, by the acknow|legement, that the la&s;t is but too nece&s;&s;ary to the tran|quillity of my mind, in the &s;ituation in which the grant of my fir&s;t wi&s;h will plea&s;e me. Let me know, Che|valier, when I have &s;et my hand to the plough, that there is no looking back; and that the <HI>only</HI> man I ever thought of with tenderne&s;s is another's, and, were I <HI>not</HI> profe&s;&s;ed, never could be mine. An&s;wer, as I wi&s;h; and I &s;hall be able to follow you, Sir, with my prayers, to the country that has the honour of pro|ducing &s;uch an ornament to human nature.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be known, you will readily &s;uppo&s;e, that I have &s;ought to intere&s;t you in my plea. For this rea&s;on, I have not &s;hewn this Letter to any-body. Father Mare&s;cotti, I have hopes, as a Religious, will declare him&s;elf in my favour, if <HI>you</HI> do. My brother, the Bi&s;hop, &s;urely will &s;trengthen your hand and his, tho' he appears as the <HI>Brother,</HI> not as the Prelate, in &s;upport of the family rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>I am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, I long to &s;ee you, Sir. I can the more readily allow my&s;elf to tell you &s;o, as I can declare that I am unalterably determined in my adherence to my written re&s;olution, never to tru&s;t to my own &s;trength in an article in which my everla&s;ting welfare is concerned. O, Sir, what &s;truggles, what conflicts, did this re&s;olution co&s;t me, before I could make it!&mdash;But <HI>once</HI> made, and upon <HI>&s;uch</HI> deliberation, and after I had begged of God his direction, which I imagine he has graciou&s;ly given me, I have never wi&s;hed to alter it. Forgive me, Sir. You will; you are a good man:&mdash;My God only have I preferred to you.</P>

<P>MY dear corre&s;pondent a&s;ks, If I am convinced by her rea&s;onings&mdash;I repeat, That I re&s;ign to your will every hope, every wi&s;h, re&s;pecting my&s;elf. In a ca&s;e where con&s;cience can be pleaded, no other rea|&s;onings are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But what can I &s;ay, mo&s;t excellent of women, to the reque&s;t you make, that I will &s;upport you in your &s;olicitude to take the veil? I hope you only propo&s;e this to me, by way of a&s;king my advice&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me, &s;ay you, <HI>advi&s;e</HI> with my tutor, my friend, my brother"</Q>&mdash;I have given the highe&s;t in&s;tance that man could give, of my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s; and I will now, as you re|quire, &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf a Catholic in the humble ad|vice I &s;hall offer to my &s;i&s;terly friend; and this will the rather appear as I &s;hould, as a Prote&s;tant, argue again&s;t any one's binding him or her&s;elf, by vows of perpe|tual celibacy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Need I, a&s;ks my dear corre&s;pondent, &s;ugge&s;t a plea for you to make, the force of which mu&s;t be allowed, if ever you fervently loved Clementina?"</Q> At what plea does the excellent Clementina hint? Is it not at an <HI>Herodian</HI> one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herod directed, that his Mariamne &s;hould be put to death, that &s;he might not be the wife of any other man, if he returned not alive from the court of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, before whom he was cited to an&s;wer for his conduct, which had been obnoxious to that prince, in the conte&s;t between him and Antony for the empire of the world.</NOTE>? Why, if ever &s;he honoured her Grandi&s;on with her e&s;teem, does &s;he not enforce the &s;ame plea with regard to him? Can &s;he, avowing the e&s;teem, be &s;o generous as to wi&s;h him to enter into the married &s;tate, and even to in&s;i&s;t upon it, as a
<PB N="222" REF="223">
&s;tep that would contribute to her future peace of mind, yet hope to prevail upon him to make it his reque&s;t, that &s;he may be &s;ecluded from a po&s;&s;ibility of ever en|joying the &s;ame liberty? Were I <HI>married,</HI> and capable of wi&s;hing to fetter and re&s;train thus my <HI>wife,</HI> in ca&s;e of her &s;urviving me, I &s;hould think &s;he ought to de&s;pi&s;e me for the narrowne&s;s of my heart. What then is the plea that a young Lady, in the bloom of beauty, would put me upon making?&mdash;And to whom?&mdash;To her own relations, who all <HI>langui&s;h,</HI> as &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf, for <HI>opportunities to oblige him;</HI> and who are extremely earne&s;t to di&s;&s;uade her from entering upon the mea&s;ure &s;he wi&s;hes him to promote? Can he, ma|dam, to u&s;e your own words in the &s;olemn paper you give me, think of <HI>taking &s;uch advantage of their ge|nero&s;ity</HI> to him?</P>
<P>But can Clementina della Porretta, who is ble&s;t with the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of parents, and who has always gloried in her duty to them; who&s;e brothers love her with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s that hardly any brothers before them have been able to &s;hew; can &s;he, in oppo&s;ition to the will of her grandfathers, wi&s;h to enter into a mea&s;ure, that mu&s;t fru&s;trate all their hopes from her for ever?&mdash;Dear Lady! con&s;i|der.</P>
<P>You, my beloved corre&s;pondent, who hold marriage as a &s;acrament, &s;urely cannot doubt but you may &s;erve God in it with much greater efficacy, than were you to &s;eque&s;ter your&s;elf from a world that wants &s;uch an example as you are able to give it. But, madam, your parents propo&s;e not marriage to you: They, only, at pre&s;ent, be&s;eech, not command you (they know the genero&s;ity of your heart) not to take a &s;tep that mu&s;t entirely fru&s;trate all their hopes, and put an option out of your own power, &s;hould you change your mind. Let me advi&s;e you, madam, di&s;claiming all intere&s;ted views, and from motives of a Love merely fraternal (for &s;uch is your expectation from the man
<PB N="223" REF="224">
you honour with your corre&s;pondence) to &s;et the hearts of relations, &s;o ju&s;tly dear to you, at ea&s;e; and to leave to Providence the i&s;&s;ue. They never, madam, will compel you. And give me leave to &s;ay, that piety requires this of you. Does not the Almighty, every|where in his word, &s;anctify the <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> commands of parents? Does he not intere&s;t him&s;elf, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, in the performance of the &s;ilial duty? May it not be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that to obey your parents, is &s;erve God? Would the generous, the noble-minded Clementina della Porretta, <HI>narrow,</HI> as I may &s;ay, her piety, by limiting it (I &s;peak now as if I were a Ca|tholic, and as if I thought there were &s;ome <HI>merit</HI> in &s;ecluding one's &s;elf from the world) when &s;he could, at lea&s;t, <HI>equally</HI> &s;erve God, and benefit her own &s;oul, by obeying her parents, by fulfilling the will of her decea&s;ed grandfathers, and by obliging all her other near and dear relations? Lady Clementina cannot re|&s;olve all the world into her&s;elf. Shall I &s;ay, there is often cowardice, there is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and perhaps, in the world's eye, a too &s;trong con&s;e&s;&s;ion of di&s;appoint|ment, in &s;uch &s;eclu&s;ions?</P>
<P>There are about you per&s;ons who can give this argument its full force&mdash;I cannot do it. O my Cle|mentina, my &s;i&s;ter, my friend, I cannot be &s;o great, &s;o undive&s;ted, in this in&s;tance, as you can be!&mdash;But I can be ju&s;t: I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, I cannot be ungene|rous. I tell you not what I hope to be enabled by your noble example, in time, to do, becau&s;e of the pre&s;ent <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> of your <HI>health.</HI> But you mu&s;t not, madam, expect from <HI>me</HI> a conduct, that you think it would become <HI>you</HI> to di&s;avow. Delicate as the <HI>fe|male</HI> mind is, and as is mo&s;t particularly my dear corre&s;pondent's that of the man, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, &s;hould &s;hew at lea&s;t an <HI>equal</HI> delicacy: For has he not her honour, as a woman, to protect, as well as his own, as a man, to regard?</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s me not, my dear Clementina; <HI>add</HI> not, I
<PB N="224" REF="225">
&s;hould <HI>rather</HI> &s;ay, to my di&s;tre&s;s, by the declaration of <HI>yours.</HI> I repeat, that your parents will not compel you. Put it not out of your <HI>power</HI> to be prevailed upon to do an act of <HI>duty.</HI> God requires not that you &s;hould be dead to your friends, in order to live to Him. Their hope is laudable. Will Lady Clementina della Porretta put it out even of the <HI>Almighty</HI>'s power, to ble&s;s their hope? Will &s;he think her&s;elf unhappy, if &s;he cannot puni&s;h them, in&s;tead of rewarding them, for all their tender and indulgent goodne&s;s to her?&mdash;It cannot be. God Almighty perfect his own work, &s;o happily begun, in the full re&s;toration of your health! This ble&s;&s;ing, I have no doubt, will attend your filial obedience. But can you, my dear corre&s;pondent, expect it, if you make your&s;elf unea&s;y, and keep your mind in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, as to your duty, and indulge your|&s;elf in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the will of God, and the will of your parents, are oppo&s;ite, when theirs is &s;olely de|&s;igned for your good, &s;piritual and temporal? A great deal now depends upon your&s;elf. O, madam, will you not in a <HI>&s;maller</HI> in&s;tance, were your heart ever &s;o much engaged to the cloi&s;tered life, practi&s;e that &s;elf-denial, which in the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> you enforce upon me? All your temporal duties, again&s;t you; and your &s;pi|ritual not favouring, much le&s;s impelling, you?</P>
<P>But once more, I quit a &s;ubject, that may, and, no doubt, will, be enforced in a much &s;tronger man|ner, than I <HI>can</HI> enforce it. I will &s;oon, very &s;oon, pay my duty to you, and all yours. You own your wi&s;hes to &s;ee me, becau&s;e you are fortified by your invincible adherence to your re&s;olution. I will ac|knowlege angui&s;h of heart. I cannot, as I told you above, be &s;o great as you. But if you will permit your &s;i&s;terly Love to have its full operation, and if you wi&s;h me peace of mind, and a cordial re&s;ignation to your will, let me &s;ee you, madam, on the next vi&s;it I &s;hall have the honour to make you, chearful, &s;erene, and determined to re&s;ign your will to the rea&s;onable

will of parents, who, I am confident, I again repeat it, will never compel you to marry&mdash;Have they not al|ready given you a very &s;trong in&s;tance, that they will not?&mdash;In a word, let me hear you declare, that you will re&s;ign your&s;elf to their will, in this article of the veil; and I &s;hall then, with the more chearfulne&s;s, endeavour to re&s;ign to yours, &s;o &s;trongly and repeatedly declared, in the Letter before me, to, dear Lady,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Thur&s;day, Aug. <HI>17-28.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL hereafter have a pretty large &s;upplement to give you to my literary journal; having found it nece&s;&s;ary, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in the pa&s;t month, to amu&s;e my&s;elf with &s;ubjects without my&s;elf. And I &s;hall &s;end you now the copies of three Letters of mine, written in Italian to Lady Clementina; and two of hers, in an&s;wer to the fir&s;t and &s;econd of them.</P>
<P>I arrived here ye&s;terday. But before I proceed to acquaint you with my reception, I &s;hould mention, that Lady Olivia arrived at her own place at Flo|rence, on Friday la&s;t. I was then in that city, but newly returned from Naples and Rome. She &s;ent one of her gentlemen to me the night of her arrival, to acquaint me with it, and to de&s;ire me to attend her next morning. I went.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t reception of me was polite and agreeable. But the moment her aunt Maffei withdrew, and we
<PB N="226" REF="227">
were alone, her eyes darting a fiercer ray, Wretch, &s;aid &s;he, what di&s;turbance, what anxieties, ha&s;t thou given me!&mdash;But it is well, that thy ingratitude to the creature who has ri&s;qued &s;o much for thee, has been rewarded, as it ought to be, by a repul&s;e from a &s;till prouder heart, if po&s;&s;ible than thy own!</P>
<P>You, Lady Olivia, an&s;wered I, have <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to im|pute pride to me. You have given me many oppor|tunities to &s;hew you, that I, a man, can keep my temper; when you, a woman, have not been able to keep yours; yet, in me, never met with an aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Not an aggre&s;&s;or, Sir!&mdash;To &s;ay nothing of the con|tempts you ca&s;t upon me here in my own Italy, what was your treatment of me in your England&mdash;Paltry i&s;land! I de&s;pi&s;e it!&mdash;To re&s;olve to leave me there! To refu&s;e to compliment me with a day, an hour! [O my dete&s;ted weakne&s;s! What a figure did I make among your friends!] And declaredly to attend the motions of the haughtie&s;t woman in Europe! Thank God, for your own &s;ake; yes, Sir, I have the cha|rity to &s;ay, for <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake; that you are di&s;ap|pointed!</P>
<P>I pity you, Lady Olivia: From my &s;oul I pity you! And &s;hould abhor my&s;elf, were I capable of mingling in&s;ult with my pity. But I leave you.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Chevalier, catching my arm as I was going. I am more di&s;plea&s;ed with my&s;elf than with you. A creature, that has rendered her&s;elf &s;o cheap to you (but, Sir, it is <HI>only</HI> to you) cannot but be un|ea&s;y to her&s;elf; and when &s;he is, &s;he mu&s;t mi&s;behave to every-body el&s;e. Say you forgive me&mdash;</P>
<P>She held out her hand to me. But immediately, on Lady Maffei's coming in, followed by &s;ervants, withdrew it.</P>
<P>Her behaviour afterwards was that of the true pa&s;|&s;ionate woman; now ready to rave, now in tears. I. <HI>cannot,</HI> Dr. Bartlett, <HI>de&s;cend to particulars.</HI> A man, who loves the Sex; who has more compa&s;&s;ion than
<PB N="227" REF="228">
vanity in his nature; who can value (even generally faulty) per&s;ons for the qualities that are laudable in them, mu&s;t be de&s;irous to <HI>draw a veil</HI> over the weak|ne&s;&s;es of &s;uch. I left her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed? There <HI>may</HI> be ca&s;es in which &s;incerity cannot be &s;eparated from un|politene&s;s. I was obliged to be <HI>unpolite,</HI> or I could not have been <HI>&s;incere;</HI> and mu&s;t have given &s;uch an&s;wers, as would, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have intitled the Lady to think her&s;elf <HI>amu&s;ed.</HI> Poor woman! She threatened to have me overtaken by her vengeance. But now, on the di&s;appointment I had met with at Bologna, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to en|courage, or to di&s;courage, this unhappy Lady&mdash;I could not have been ju&s;t to <HI>her,</HI> had I not been ju&s;t to <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>A very extraordinary attempt was made, next day, on my per&s;on; I am apt to believe, from this quar|ter. It &s;ucceeded not: And as I was on the Tue&s;day to &s;et out for Bologna, I let it pa&s;s off without com|plaint or enquiry.</P>
<P>I paid the Count of Belvedere a vi&s;it, as I had pro|mi&s;ed. The General at Naples, and the Count at Parma, received me with the highe&s;t civilities; and both from the &s;ame motive. The Count <HI>will</HI> hope. The General accompanied me, with his Lady, part of my way to Florence. The motive of his journey is to rejoice per&s;onally with his friends at Urbino and Bologna, on the re&s;olution his &s;i&s;ter has taken; and to congratulate her upon it; as he has already done by Letter; the copy of which he &s;hewed me. There were high compliments made me in it. We <HI>may</HI> &s;peak hand&s;omely of the man whom we neither envy nor fear. He would have loaded me with pre&s;ents; but I declined accepting any; in &s;uch a manner, however, as he could not be di&s;&s;atisfied with me for my refu&s;al.</P>
<P>I paid al&s;o my re&s;pects at Urbino to the Altieri fa|mily, and the Conte della Porretta, in my way to
<PB N="228" REF="229">
Rome and Naples, and met with a very polite recep|tion from both. For the re&s;t of the time of my ab|&s;ence from Bologna, my literary journal will account.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day afternoon I went to the palace of Porretta. I ha&s;tened up to my Jeronymo, with whom, as al&s;o with Mr. Lowther, I had held a corre&s;pond|ence, in my ab&s;ence, and received favourable intel|ligences from them.</P>
<P>Jeronymo rejoiced to &s;ee me. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly delighted to find him &s;o much recovered. His appetite, he told me, was re&s;tored. His re&s;t was balmy and refre&s;hing. He &s;at up &s;everal hours in the day; and his &s;i&s;ter and he gave joy to each other, and to all their friends. But he hinted to me his wi&s;hes &s;till, to call me brother; and begged of God, in a very ear|ne&s;t manner, &s;natching my hand, and wetting it with his tears, that it &s;till might be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Marquis, the Marchione&s;s, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, joined to thank and applaud me for my part of the corre&s;pondence with their beloved daughter; for, on my declining to &s;upport her in her wi&s;hes to be allowed to take the veil, &s;he had &s;hewed them the copy of her &s;econd Letter, as well as my re|ply, to it. The ble&s;&s;ings which they poured out upon me, were mingled with their tears; and Father Ma|re&s;cotti and the Bi&s;hop declared, that they would, in every prayer they put up to Heaven for them&s;elves and the Family, remember me, and beg of God to &s;upply to me, by another, and even, they &s;aid, a bet|ter Clementina, the di&s;appointment I had &s;o unexpect|edly met with from theirs. The General and his La|dy, and the Count, arrived the day before: But they were not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>While they were all complimenting and applauding the almo&s;t <HI>&s;ilent</HI> man (for in &s;o critical a &s;ituation what could I &s;ay?) Camilla came in, and whi&s;pering the Marchione&s;s, Clementina, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, is impatient to &s;ee her friend. Chevalier, I will intro|duce you. I followed her.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">
The young Lady, the moment &s;he beheld me, flew to me with open arms, as to her brother, her <HI>fourth brother,</HI> as &s;he called me; and thanked me, &s;he &s;aid, a thou&s;and thou&s;and times, for my Letters to her. My mamma, &s;aid &s;he, has &s;een them all. But, ah, Sir, your third!&mdash;I did not think you would have refu&s;ed me your intere&s;t with my friends. I cannot, cannot give up that point. It was always my wi&s;h, madam (turning to her mother) to be God's child; that does not make me le&s;s yours and my papa's. O, Cheva|lier! you have not quieted, you have not convinced, my heart!</P>
<P>I promi&s;e my&s;elf, that I could have left you without a plea, my dear corre&s;pondent, returned I, had my heart been at ea&s;e, and the argument le&s;s affecting to my&s;elf. And &s;urely, if Lady Clementina had been convinced, &s;he would have acted up to her con|viction.</P>
<P>O, Sir, you are a dangerous man! I &s;ee, if a cer|tain event had taken place, I &s;hould have been a lo&s;t creature!&mdash;Are not you, Sir, convinced, that I &s;hould, in my notions of a lo&s;t creature? If you are, I hope <HI>you</HI> will act up to your conviction.</P>
<P>Was this nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid to me? I think, on recollection, &s;he half-&s;miled when &s;he &s;aid it.</P>
<P>My dear Dr. Bartlett, you &s;ee Clementina could be plea&s;ant on an occa&s;ion &s;o &s;olemn!&mdash;But perhaps &s;he &s;aw me only affectedly chearful. Little, at pre&s;ent, as &s;he imagines it, I think it not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he may in time be brought to yield to the &s;en&s;e of her duty, laid down by &s;uch powerful advocates as &s;he has in her own family. Whatever happens, may it be happy to her and this family, and then I cannot be wholly joyle&s;s! What is there in this Life, worth&mdash;But let me not be too ab&s;tracted! This world, if we can enjoy it with innocent chearfulne&s;s, and be &s;er|viceable to our fellow-creatures, is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, even by a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">
I hope, madam, &s;aid I, to her, that at lea&s;t you &s;u&s;pend your wi&s;hes after the &s;eque&s;tred life. She allowed the force of one or two of my arguments, but I could perceive, that &s;he gave not up her hope of being complied with in her wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;ume the veil.</P>
<P>The General, and his Lady, and the Count, being come in, ha&s;tened up to pay their compliments to me. How profu&s;e were the two Gentlemen in theirs!</P>
<P>At the Marchione&s;s's motion, we went to Jero|nymo, and found the Marquis, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, coming to us. And then, every one join|ing in their acknowlegements of obligation to me, and wi&s;hing it in their power to make me as happy as they declared I had made them, I &s;aid, It <HI>was</HI> in their power, I hoped, to do me an un&s;peakable plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>They called upon me, as with one voice; It is, an|&s;wered I, that my dear friend Jeronymo may be pre|vailed upon to accompany me to England. Mr. Low|ther would think him&s;elf very happy in his attendance on him there, rather than to &s;tay here; and yet, if my reque&s;t &s;hould not be granted, he is determined not to leave him till he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be out of danger.</P>
<P>They looked upon one another with eyes of plea|&s;ure and &s;urprize. Jeronymo wept. I cannot, can|not bear, &s;aid he, &s;uch a weight of obligation. Gran|di&s;on, we can do nothing for <HI>you:</HI> And you have brought me your Lowther to heal me, that you might have the killing of me your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Clementina's eyes were filled with tears. She went from us with &s;ome little precipitation.</P>
<P>O Chevalier, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, my Clemen|tina's heart is too &s;u&s;ceptible for its own ea&s;e, to im|pre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. You will quite kill the poor child&mdash;or make her repent her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>What is there but favour to me, replied I, if my
<PB N="231" REF="232">
reque&s;t can be complied with? I hope my dear Je|ronymo will not be unattended by others of his friends: I have had the promi&s;es of the two young Lords. Our baths are re&s;torative. I will attend you to them, my dear Jeronymo. The difference of air, of climate, may, probably, be tried with advantage. Let me have the honour of entertaining you in England, look|ing all round me; and that I will con&s;ider, as a full return of the obligations you think &s;o highly of, and are &s;o &s;olicitous to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>They looked upon one another, in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Would to God, proceeded I, that you, my Lord, and you, madam (directing my&s;elf to the father and mother) would honour me, as my gue&s;ts, for one &s;ea&s;on&mdash;You once had thoughts of it, had a certain happy event taken place&mdash;I dare promi&s;e you both, after the fatigues you have undergone, a renewal of health, from our &s;alutary &s;prings. I &s;hould be but too happy, if, in &s;uch com|pany, a &s;i&s;ter might be allowed to vi&s;it a brother!&mdash;But if this be thought too great a favour, that &s;i&s;ter, in your ab&s;ence, cannot but give and receive plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes in vi&s;iting Mrs. Beaumont at Florence; &s;ometimes her Brother and his Lady at Naples. And I will engage my two Si&s;ters and their Lords to ac|company me in my attendance on you back to Bo|logna. My Si&s;ters will be delighted with the oppor|tunity of vi&s;iting Italy, and of paying their re&s;pects to a young Lady who&s;e character they revere, and to whom once their brother had hoped to give them the honour of a relation.</P>
<P>They &s;till continuing &s;ilent, but none of them &s;eem|ing di&s;plea&s;ed; You will, by &s;uch a favour, my dear Lords, and you, madam, to the Marchione&s;s, do me credit with <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> as I may &s;ay. I &s;hall return to my native country, if I go alone, after the hopes you had all given me, like a di&s;appointed and rejected man. My pride, as well as my plea&s;ure, is concerned on this occa&s;ion. My hou&s;e in the country, my hou&s;e

in London, &s;hall be yours. I will be either inmate or vi&s;iter, at your plea&s;ure. No man loves his country better than I do: But you will induce me to love it &s;till better, if by your compliance with my earne&s;t reque&s;t, you &s;hall be able to obtain either health or plea&s;ure from a twelvemonth's re&s;idence in it. Ob|lige me, my dear Lords; oblige me, madam; were it but to give your&s;elves a new reli&s;h to your own country and palace on your return. Our &s;ummers have not your fervid &s;un: Our commerce gives us, in the highe&s;t perfection, all your ju&s;tly boa&s;ted au|tumnal fruits: Nor are our winters &s;o cold as yours. Oblige me, for the approaching winter only; and &s;tay longer, as you &s;hall find inclination.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Grandi&s;on, &s;aid Jeronymo, I will accept of your invitation the moment I am told that I may un|dertake the journey&mdash;</P>
<P>The journey, my Lord, interrupted I!&mdash;Your cabin &s;hall be made near as convenient to you, as your chamber. You &s;hall be &s;et a&s;hore within half a league of my hou&s;e in London. God give us a plea&s;ant voyage; and in a few days time, you will not know, except by amended health and &s;pirits, that you are not in this your own chamber.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;aid the General, my &s;i&s;ter was right in her apprehen&s;ions, that &s;he &s;hould not be able to continue a Catholic, had &s;he been this man's. I wi&s;h <HI>you,</HI> my Lord, <HI>you,</HI> madam, and Jeronymo, would go. You have had a long cour&s;e of fatigues and troubles. You love the Chevalier. <HI>Winter</HI> with him, however. I have heard much of the efficacy of the Engli&s;h baths. Clementina mu&s;t not go. My wife and I will make her as happy as po&s;&s;ible in your ab&s;ence: And take Grandi&s;on at his word. Bring him, and his &s;i&s;ters, back with you. Their Lords, I under&s;tand, <HI>have been</HI> among us. They will not be &s;orry to vi&s;it Italy a &s;econd time, as, no doubt, they are men of ta&s;te&mdash;But when, Chevalier, do you think of going?</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">
The &s;ooner the better, were it but to take advan|tage of the fine &s;ea&s;on: It will be but what mariners call a <HI>trip</HI> to England. You will make me very hap|py. You can have no other way of di&s;charging the obligations you are &s;o &s;ollicitous about. I will return with you: The health of Lady Clementina, I flatter my&s;elf, will be quite confirmed by that time. Signor Jeronymo, I hope, will be re&s;tored likewi&s;e: What joy &s;hall we be enabled to give one another:&mdash;</P>
<P>They took only till the morning to con&s;ult, and give me an an&s;wer.</P>

<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXXVIII.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Lowther and his collegues, having been con|&s;ulted, gave it as their opinion, that Jeronymo might be removed by litter to the neare&s;t &s;ea-port, and there embark for England; but that it is mo&s;t eligible to &s;tay till the next &s;pring, by which time they hope the two old wounds may be &s;afely cicatrized, and the new one only kept open.</P>
<P>But they all engaged, that then not only Jeronymo, and the two young Lords, but &s;ome others of the fa|mily, will be my gue&s;ts in England; and, in the mean time, that the Bi&s;hop and Father Mare&s;cotti will in turn corre&s;pond with me, and acquaint me with all that pa&s;&s;es here.</P>
<P>Clementina drank chocolate with us. She had been made acquainted with their determination, and ap|proved of the promi&s;es of a vi&s;it to be made me next year, by &s;ome of the principals of the family. What a hard circum&s;tance is it, whi&s;pered &s;he, as &s;he &s;at next me, that the per&s;on who would be <HI>mo&s;t</HI> willing to go, and I flatter my&s;elf, would not be the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> welcome, mu&s;t not be of the company! I &s;hould have been glad to have made one vi&s;it to the country where the Chevalier Grandi&s;on was born.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
And what a perver&s;ene&s;s, thought I, is there in cu|&s;tom; that would not permit this kind explicitne&s;s in Lady Clementina, were &s;he not determined to con&s;ider the <HI>brother,</HI> in the man before her, rather than a &s;till nearer relation! By how many ways, my dear Dr. Bartlett, may delicate minds expre&s;s a denial!&mdash;Ne|gatives need not to be frowningly given, nor affirma|tives blu&s;hingly pronounced.</P>
<P>Jeronymo and I being left alone, he challenged me on the vi&s;ible concern which he, and every one, as he &s;aid, &s;aw in my countenance, on the turn his &s;i&s;ter had taken: Had it not been in my heart, he was &s;ure it would not have been <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>Can you wonder at it, my dear friend? &s;aid I: When I came over, greatly as I thought of your &s;i&s;ter, I did not think &s;he had been <HI>&s;o</HI> great, as &s;he has &s;hewn her|&s;elf. I admired her ever; but I now <HI>more</HI> than admire her. Taught to hope, as I was, and &s;o unexpectedly di&s;appointed, as I have been, I mu&s;t have been more than man, were I not very much affected.</P>
<P>No doubt but you mu&s;t; and I am cordially con|cerned for your concern. But, my dear Grandi&s;on, it is only God that &s;he prefers to you. She &s;uffers more than you can do. She has no other way, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, to comfort her&s;elf, but by indulging her hopes, that &s;he &s;hall not live long&mdash;Dear creature! She flat|ters her&s;elf, that her rea&s;on is re&s;tored, in an&s;wer to her fervent &s;upplications, which, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he put up to Heaven, in all her lucid intervals, that for the &s;ake of her parents and brothers, it might be re&s;tored, and that then &s;he might be taken to the arms of mercy. But if your heart be <HI>deeply</HI> affected, my Grandi&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>It is, Jeronymo. I am not an in&s;en&s;ible man. But &s;hould now our dear Clementina be prevailed upon to de&s;cend from the height to which &s;he has &s;oared, how|ever my wi&s;hes might be gratified by the conde&s;cen|&s;ion: yet, while &s;he believed her con&s;cience would be wounded by it, I could not but think it would be &s;ome
<PB N="235" REF="236">
diminution to her glory. And how, as &s;he has hinted in one of her letters to me, would it be po&s;&s;ible, were I to &s;ee my beloved wife unhappy with her &s;cruples, to forbear endeavouring to quiet her mind by removing them? And could <HI>this</HI> be effected, without giving her an opinion of the religion I profe&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to hers? And would not that &s;ubject me to a breach of articles? O my dear Jeronymo! Matters mu&s;t &s;tand ju&s;t as they do, except &s;he could think more favour|ably of my religion, and le&s;s favourably of her own.</P>
<P>He began to talk of their obligations to me. I de|clared, that they could no other way give me pain. Do not, &s;aid I, let this &s;ubject ever be again men|tioned, by you, or any of the family. Every one, my dear Jeronymo, is not called upon by the occa|&s;ion, as I have had the happine&s;s to be. Would my friend envy me this happine&s;s?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Dr. Bartlett, with all my heart, that I could think of any thing that I could accept of, to make &s;uch grateful &s;pirits ea&s;y. It pains me, to be placed by them in &s;uch a &s;uperior light, as mu&s;t give <HI>them</HI> pain. What, my dear Dr. Bartlett, can I do, con&s;i&s;tent with my notions of friend&s;hip, to make their hearts ea&s;y?</P>
<P>He was afraid, he &s;aid, that I &s;hould now &s;oon think of leaving them.</P>
<P>I told him, that having no doubt of Lady Clemen|tina's per&s;everance in her re&s;olution, and of her leave to return to my native country, I &s;hould be glad, for my own &s;ake, as well as the Lady's, to be allowed to depart in a few days. Mr. Lowther, as it would make Jeronymo, as he had declared, more ea&s;y, would &s;tay behind me. But di&s;mi&s;s him, my friend, &s;aid I, as &s;oon as you can. He had obtained abroad a happy competency, and was returned to England, when I fir&s;t knew him, with intent to enjoy it. He is as rich as he wants to be; and can grati&s;y only the natural benevolence of his heart, by attending my dear friend.
<PB N="236" REF="237">
I hope to get him to accept of apartments with me, in my London hou&s;e; and to fix his retirement, if not with me in my paternal &s;eat, in its neighbourhood at lea&s;t. He has merit that is not confined to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion: But for what he has done for my Jeronymo, he will always hold a prime place in my heart.</P>
<P>It is <HI>true,</HI> Dr. Bartlett; and I plea&s;e my&s;elf, that he will be found as worthy of your friendly love, and my Beauchamp's, as of mine. If I can at la&s;t be in|dulged in my long, long hoped-for wi&s;h, of &s;ettling in my native country, with &s;ome tolerable tranquillity of mind, I &s;hall endeavour to draw around me &s;uch a  ollection of worthies, as &s;hall make my neighbour|hood one of the happie&s;t &s;pots in Britain.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s came up to us. Clementina, &s;aid &s;he, is apprehen&s;ive that you &s;oon will leave us. Her father and brothers are walking with her in the garden: They will, I dare &s;ay, be glad of your company.</P>
<P>I left Jeronymo and his mother together; and joined the Marquis, the General, the Bi&s;hop, and Clementina. The General's Lady and Father Mare|&s;cotti were in another ally, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Marquis made me a high compliment; and after a few turns, the Prelate led off his father and brother, and left Clementina and me alone together.</P>
<P>Were you not cruel, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, in your la&s;t Lettet to me, not only to deny me your weight in the reque&s;t my heart was, and is &s;till, &s;et upon; but to &s;trengthen their arguments again&s;t me? Great u&s;e have &s;ome of my friends made of what you wrote. O Sir, you have won the heart of Giacomo: but you have contributed to oppre&s;s that of his &s;i&s;ter. Indeed, indeed, I cannot be ea&s;y, if I am denied the veil.</P>
<P>Dear Lady Clementina, remember, that the full e&s;tabli&s;hment of your health depends, under God, up|on the quiet of your own mind. Give not way, I be|&s;eech you, to unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions. What daughter may rely upon the indulgence of a father and mother,
<PB N="237" REF="238">
what &s;i&s;ter upon the affection of brothers, if you may not upon yours? You have &s;een how much their happine&s;s depends upon your health. Would you doubt the efficacy of that piety, while you are in the world, of which you have already (Shall I &s;ay to <HI>my</HI> co&s;t?) given an in&s;tance &s;o glorious to your&s;elf, that the &s;ufferer by it cannot help applauding you for it?</P>
<P>O Chevalier! Say not <HI>at your co&s;t,</HI> if you wi&s;h me to be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t difficulty <HI>have</HI> I re&s;trained, and do I re&s;train, my&s;elf on the&s;e occa&s;ions. I mu&s;t, how|ever, add, on this, a few words: You have obliged me, madam, to give one of the greate&s;t in&s;tances of &s;elf-denial, that ever was given by man: Let me be|&s;eech you, deare&s;t Lady Clementina, for your own &s;ake, for the &s;ake of your duty, as well to the depart|ed, as to the living (and, may I add, for <HI>my,</HI> &s;ake?) that you would decline this now favourite wi&s;h of your heart.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed; and at la&s;t &s;aid, Well, Sir, I &s;ee I mu&s;t not expect any favour from you, on this &s;ubject. Let us turn into that &s;haded ally. And now, Sir, as to the other part of my reque&s;t to you, in my la&s;t Let|ter&mdash;It was not a reque&s;t made on undeliberate mo|tives.</P>
<P>What is that, madam?</P>
<P>How &s;hall I &s;ay it?&mdash;Yet I will&mdash;If, Chevalier, you would bani&s;h from my heart&mdash;Again &s;he &s;topt. I thought not, at that moment, of what &s;he meant.</P>

<P>Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t marry!&mdash;Then, Sir, &s;hall I not doubt of my adhering to my re&s;olution. But, &s;ay not a word till I have told you, that the Lady mu&s;t be an Engli&s;h woman. She mu&s;t not be an Italian. Olivia would not &s;cruple to change her religion for you. But Olivia mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> be yours. You could not be happy, Iper&s;uade my&s;elf, with Olivia. Do you think you could?</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
I bowed, in confirmation of her opinion.</P>
<P>I <HI>thought</HI> you could not. Let not Clementina be di&s;graced in your choice of a wife. I have a proud heart. Let it not be &s;aid, that the man, of whom Clementina della Porretta thought with di&s;tinction, undervalued him&s;elf in marriage.</P>
<P>This, Dr. Bartlett, was a reque&s;t of the &s;ame ge|nerous import, that &s;he mentioned in her re&s;verie, be|fore I left Italy. How con&s;i&s;tently delicate! She had tears in her eyes, as &s;he &s;poke. I was too much af|fected with her genero&s;ity, to interrupt her.</P>
<P>If you marry, Sir, I &s;hall, perhaps, be allowed to be one in the party, that will make you a vi&s;it in Eng|land: My &s;i&s;ter-in-law has, within this hour, wi&s;hed to be one. She will endeavour to prevail upon her Lord (He can deny her nothing) to accompany her. You will be able to induce Mrs. Beaumont once more to vi&s;it her native country. You and your Lady, and perhaps your Si&s;ters and their Lords, will return with <HI>us.</HI> Thus &s;hall we be as one family. If I am not to be obliged in <HI>another</HI> wi&s;h, I mu&s;t in <HI>this:</HI> And this <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be in your power. And will you not make me ea&s;y?</P>
<P>Admirable Clementina! Who can be &s;o great as you? Such tenderne&s;s as I read in your eyes, &s;uch magnanimity, never before met in woman!

Nor am I a&s;hamed to acknowlege the kind|ne&s;s of your compa&s;&s;ion to me. I will retain a grate|ful &s;en&s;e of it, to the la&s;t hour of my life. I wi&s;h to be remembred by you with tenderne&s;s to the la&s;t hour of yours. I may not live long: I will therefore yield to your reque&s;t, &s;o earne&s;tly made, and to the <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> of my deare&s;t friends, in &s;u&s;pending, at lea&s;t, <HI>my own.</HI> I will hope to &s;ee you (in the happy &s;tate I have hint|ed at) in England, and afterwards in Italy. I will &s;uppo&s;e you of my family. I will &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf of

yours. On the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, in the&s;e hopes, I can part with you; as, if I live, it will be a temporary parting only; an ab&s;ence of a few months. And have I not behaved well for the whole la&s;t month, and &s;e|veral days over, tho' I reckoned to my&s;elf the time as it pa&s;&s;ed, more than once every day, as &s;o much elap&s;ed, and nearer to the time of your return?&mdash;I own it (blu&s;hing)&mdash;And now, Sir, I return to you the option you offered me. Be the day, the &s;olemn day, at <HI>your</HI> nomination&mdash;Your <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> Clementina will &s;urrender you up to <HI>her</HI> Si&s;ters and <HI>yours</HI>&mdash;O Sir! li&s;t|ing up her eyes to me, and beholding an emotion in me which I tried to conceal, but could not, how good, how compa&s;&s;ionate, how affectionate, you are!&mdash;But name to me <HI>now</HI> your day! This &s;eat, when you are far, far di&s;tant from me, &s;hall be a &s;eat con|&s;ecrated to the remembrance of your tenderne&s;s. I will vi&s;it it every day; nor &s;hall the &s;ummer's &s;un, nor the winter's fro&s;t, keep me from it.</P>
<P>It will be be&s;t, taking her hand, admirable Lady! it will be be&s;t for us both, for <HI>me</HI> I am &s;ure it will, that the &s;olemn day be early. Next Monday morning let me &s;et out&mdash;Sunday <HI>evening</HI>&mdash;The <HI>day,</HI> on my part, &s;hall be a day pa&s;&s;ed in imploring health, happi|ne&s;s, and every ble&s;&s;ing, on my deare&s;t Clementina, on our Jeronymo, and their whole family; and for a happy meeting to us all in England&mdash;SUNDAY EVEN|ING, if you plea&s;e, I will&mdash;I could not &s;peak out the &s;entence.</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into tears; reclined her face on my &s;houl|der&mdash;her bo&s;om heaved&mdash;and &s;he &s;obbed out&mdash;Oh, Chevalier!&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;t, mu&s;t</HI>&mdash;But <HI>be</HI> it&mdash;<HI>Be</HI> it &s;o!&mdash;And God Almighty &s;trengthen the minds of both!</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, who was coming towards us, &s;aw at di&s;tance the emotion of her beloved daughter and fearing &s;he was &s;ainting, ha&s;tened to her, and cla&s;ping her arms about her&mdash;My child, my Clemen|tina, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Why the&s;e &s;treaming eyes? Look upon me, Love.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242">
Ah, madam! The day, the day is &s;et!&mdash;Next Monday!&mdash;The Chevalier will leave Bologna!</P>
<P>God forbid&mdash;Chevalier, you will not &s;o &s;oon leave us? My dear, we will prevail upon the Chevalier&mdash;</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, and walked into a cro&s;s alley from them. I was greatly affected!&mdash;O Dr. Bartlett! The&s;e good women!&mdash;Why have I a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible; yet &s;uch demands upon it for fortitude?</P>
<P>The General, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, came to me. I briefly recounted to them, the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between Lady Cle|mentina and me. The Marquis joined his Lady and daughter; and Clementina, in her tender way, gave her father and mother an account of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Marquis and his Lady, leaving her to her Ca|milla, joined us: O Chevalier! &s;aid the Marquis, how can we think of parting with you?&mdash;And &s;o &s;oon?&mdash;You will not &s;o &s;uddenly leave us?</P>
<P>Not if Lady Clementina commands the contrary. If &s;he do not, the &s;ooner, the better it will be for <HI>me.</HI> I cannot bear her generous excellence. She is the mo&s;t exalted of women.&mdash;See! the dear Lady before us, leaning on her Camilla, as if &s;he wanted &s;up|port!</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and you, Chevalier, &s;aid the General, will no doubt corre&s;pond. We &s;hall none of us deny her that liberty. As &s;he has already expre&s;&s;ed to you her wi&s;hes that you would marry; may we not hope, that you will try your influence over her, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, in your future Letters? The marriage of <HI>either</HI> will an&s;wer the end &s;he propo&s;es to her&s;elf, by urging yours.</P>
<P>Good Heaven! thought I&mdash;Do they believe me ab|&s;olutely dive&s;ted of human pa&s;&s;ions?&mdash;I have been at continual war, as you know, Dr. Bartlett, with the mo&s;t ungovernable of mine; but without wi&s;hing to overcome the tender &s;u&s;ceptibilities, which, properly directed, are the glory of the human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
This is too much to be a&s;ked, &s;aid the young Mar|chione&s;s. How can this be expected?</P>
<P>You know not, madam, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, &s;upport|ing his brother's wi&s;hes, what the Chevalier Grandi|&s;on can do, to make a whole family happy, tho' again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina, &s;aid the equally unfeeling, tho' good, Father Mare&s;cotti, thinks &s;he is under the divine direction, in the re&s;olution &s;he has taken. This world, and all its glories, are but of &s;econd con&s;ideration with her. Were it to co&s;t her her life, I am confident, &s;he would not alter it. As <HI>therefore</HI> the Chevalier can have no hopes&mdash;</P>
<P>I cannot a&s;k this, &s;aid the Marquis. You &s;ee how hard a ta&s;k <HI>(referring to me)</HI>&mdash;O that the great ob&s;ta|cle <HI>could be</HI> removed! My dear Grandi&s;on, taking my hand, cannot, cannot&mdash;But I dare not a&s;k&mdash;If it could, my own &s;ons would not be more dear to me, than you.</P>
<P>My Lord, you honour me. You engage my ut|mo&s;t gratitude. It is with difficulty that I am able to adhere to my engagement, not to pre&s;s her to be mine, when I have the honour to be with her. I have wi&s;hed her to re&s;ign her will to that of her fa|ther and mother, as you have &s;een, <HI>knowing</HI> the con|&s;equence. I am per&s;uaded, that if <HI>either</HI> were to mar|ry, the other would be more ea&s;y in mind; and I had much rather follow her example, than &s;et her one&mdash;You will &s;ee what my return to my native country will do for us both. But &s;he mu&s;t not be precipi|tated. If &s;he is, her wi&s;hes to take the veil may be re&s;umed. Punctilio will join with her piety; and, if not complied with, &s;he may then again be un|happy.</P>
<P>They agreed to follow my advice; to have patience; and leave the i&s;&s;ue to time.</P>
<P>I left them, and went to Jeronymo. I communi|cated to him what had pa&s;&s;ed, and the early day I
<PB N="243" REF="244">
had named for &s;etting out on my return to England. This I did, with as much tenderne&s;s as po&s;&s;ible. Yet his concern was &s;o great upon it, that it added much to mine; and I was forced, with &s;ome precipitation, to quit his chamber, and the hou&s;e; and to retire to my lodgings, in order to compo&s;e my&s;elf.</P>
<P>And thus, my dear Dr. Bartlett, is the day of my &s;etting out fixed. I hope I &s;hall not be induced to alter it. Mrs. Beaumont, I know, will excu&s;e me going back to Florence. Olivia mu&s;t. I hope &s;he will. I &s;hall write to both.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take my route thro' Modena, Parma, Pla|centia. Lady Sforza has de&s;ired an interview with me. I hope &s;he will meet me at Pavia, or Turin. If not, I will attend her at Milan. I promi&s;ed to pay her a vi&s;it before I quitted Italy: But as her reque&s;t to &s;ee me was made while it was thought there might have been a relation between us, I &s;uppo&s;e the inter|view now can mean nothing but civility. I hope, if I &s;ee her, her cruel daughter will not be pre&s;ent.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Parma, <DATE>Monday Night, Aug. <HI>21.</HI> Monday Night, Sept. <HI>1.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE I am, my dear Dr. Bartlett. Ju&s;t arrived.</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere allows me to be alone. I am not fit for company.</P>
<P>The whole family, Jeronymo and Clementina ex|cepted, dined with me on Saturday. Clementina was not well enough to leave her chamber. She would endeavour, &s;he &s;aid, on Sunday right, when I was to take my leave of them all, to behave with as much pre&s;ence of mind as &s;he did on a former occa&s;ion. All the intervenient time, &s;he &s;aid, was nece&s;&s;ary to for|tify her heart. But, alas! the circum&s;tances between
<PB N="244" REF="245">
us, then and now, were not the &s;ame. We had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been allowedly too dear to each other, to appear, either of us, &s;o politely di&s;tant, as we did then.</P>
<P>She never once a&s;ked me to &s;u&s;pend the day of my departure. Every one el&s;e repeatedly did. We <HI>both</HI> thought it be&s;t, as the &s;eparation was nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>I had many things to do; many Letters to write; much to &s;ay to Mr. Lowther, and he to me. I de|clined therefore their invitation to attend them home in the evening, as well as to dine with them next day. The &s;olemn vi&s;it was to be made ye&s;terday in the evening; and every vi&s;it near the time, would have been as &s;o many farewels. My own heart, at lea&s;t, told me &s;o, and forbad me more than one parting &s;cene. The time <HI>&s;o</HI> near, they them&s;elves wi&s;hed it pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Count had come from Urbino on purpo&s;e, with the two young Lords, to take leave of me: What ble&s;&s;ings did that nobleman, and the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, invoke upon me! The General had more than once tears in his eyes: He be&s;ought me to forgive him for every-thing, in his behaviour, that had been di&s;agreeable to me. His Lady permitted me to take leave of her in the mo&s;t affectionate manner; and &s;aid, that &s;he hoped to prevail on her Lord to vi&s;it me him&s;elf, and to allow her to bear him com|pany, in my own country. The Bi&s;hop &s;upplicated Heaven to reward me, for what he called my good|ne&s;s to their family. Father Mare&s;cotti joined in his &s;upplications, with a bent knee. The Marquis and Marchione&s;s both wept; and called me by very en|dearing names, vowing everla&s;ting love and gratitude to me. Jeronymo! my dear Jeronymo! one of the mo&s;t amiable of men! how precious to my &s;oul will ever be the remembrance of his friendly Love! <HI>His</HI> only con&s;olation was, and it is <HI>mine,</HI> that, in a few
<PB N="245" REF="246">
months, we &s;hall meet in England. They wanted to load me with pre&s;ents. They pained me with their importunities, that I would accept of &s;ome very valu|able ones. They &s;aw my pain; and, in pity to me, declined their generous &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>Clementina was not pre&s;ent at this parting &s;cene. She had &s;hut her&s;elf up for the greate&s;t part of the day. Her mother, and her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, had been her only vi&s;iters: And &s;he having declared that &s;he was afraid of &s;eeing me, it was propo&s;ed to me, whether it were not be&s;t for me to depart, without &s;eeing her. I can well &s;pare to my&s;elf, &s;aid I, the emotions which, already &s;o great, will, on taking leave of her, be too powerful for my heart, if you think, that, when I am gone, &s;he will not wi&s;h (as once &s;he was &s;o earne&s;t, even to di&s;compo&s;ure, for a farewel vi&s;it) that &s;he had allowed her&s;elf to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>They all were then of opinion, that &s;he &s;hould be prevailed upon. Camilla at that in&s;tant came down with her Lady's de&s;ire, that I would attend her. In what way, Camilla, is my Clementina? a&s;ked the Mar|chione&s;s: Every-one attending the an&s;wer. In great grief, madam: Almo&s;t in agonies. She was &s;ending me down with her warme&s;t wi&s;hes to the Chevalier, and with her excu&s;es; but called me back, &s;aying, &s;he would &s;ubdue her&s;elf: She would &s;ee him: And bid me ha&s;ten for fear he &s;hould be gone.</P>
<P>The two Marchione&s;&s;es went up directly. I was in tremors. Surely, thought I, I am the weake&s;t of men!&mdash;The Bi&s;hop and General took notice of my emotion, and pitied me. They all joined in the wi&s;h &s;o often repeated, that I could yet be theirs.</P>
<P>I followed Camilla. Lady Clementina, when I en|tered, &s;at between the mother and &s;i&s;ter; an arm round each of their necks: Her face was reclined, as if &s;he were ready to faint, on the bo&s;om of her mo|ther, who held her &s;alts to her. I was half-way in the room, before either mother or daughter &s;aw me,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
The Chevalier Grandi&s;on, my be&s;t &s;i&s;ter! &s;aid the young Marchione&s;s: Look up, my Love.</P>
<P>She reai&s;ed her head. Then &s;tood up, courte&s;ied; and, gu&s;hing into tears, turned her face from me.</P>
<P>I approached her: Her mother gave me the hand of her Clementina&mdash;Comfort her, comfort my Cle|mentina, good Chevalier&mdash;You only can&mdash;Sit down, my Love. Take my &s;eat, Sir.</P>
<P>The young Lady trembled. She &s;at down. Her mother &s;eated her&s;elf; tears in her eyes. I &s;at down by Clementina. The dear Lady &s;obbed; and the more, as &s;he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s her emotion.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, who had kept her &s;eat&mdash;Your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid I, gives me a very high plea&s;ure, in the hope of &s;eeing you, and your Lord, a few months hence, in company with my Jero|nymo. What a ble&s;&s;ing is it to us all, that that dear friend is &s;o well recovered? I have no doubt but change of climate, and our &s;alutary &s;prings, will do wonders for him. Let us, by our <HI>patience</HI> and <HI>re&s;igna|tion,</HI> intitle our&s;elves to <HI>greater</HI> ble&s;&s;ings; the con&s;e|quence, as I hope, of tho&s;e we have <HI>already</HI> received.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e God, I will &s;ee you in England, Chevalier, &s;aid the young Marchione&s;s, if my Lord is in the lea&s;t favourable to my wi&s;hes: And I hope my beloved &s;i&s;ter may be of the party. You, madam, and the Marquis, I hope&mdash;looking at her mother-in-law.</P>
<P>I hope you will not go without <HI>us,</HI> my dear, replied the Marchion&s;s. If our dear Clementina &s;hall be well, we will not leave her behind us.</P>
<P>Ah, madam!&mdash;Ah, Sir!&mdash;&s;aid Clementina, how you flatter me! But this, <HI>this</HI> night, if the Chevalier goes early in the morning, is the la&s;t time I &s;hall ever &s;ee him.</P>
<P>God forbid! replied I&mdash;I hope that we may, many, many years rejoice, in each other's friend&s;hip. Let us look forward with what plea&s;ure we may. My heart, madam, wants your comfortings. I have a greater

Tell me, that your endeavours &s;hall not be wanting to be &s;o: And I &s;hall then be &s;o too: Dear Lady Clementina, my happine&s;s is bound up with yours.</P>

<P>By all means, an&s;wered the Marchione&s;s. We &s;hall <HI>all</HI> corre&s;pond with you. We &s;hall pray for you and ble&s;s you, every day that we live.

<P>I rai&s;ed her, and aro&s;e; and ki&s;&s;ing fir&s;t one hand, then the other, and bowing to the two Marchione&s;&s;es, was ha&s;tening from her.</P>

<P>The two Marchione&s;&s;es &s;tood together, rapt in &s;ilent attention, leaning on each other.</P>

<P>She conde&s;cendingly inclined her cheek to me: I &s;aluted her; but could not utter to her what yet was upon my lips to &s;peak.</P>
<P>She withdrew her hand. She &s;eemed to want &s;up|port. Her mother and &s;i&s;ter ha&s;tened to her. I &s;topt at the door. Her eyes pur&s;ued my motions. By her uplifted hands &s;he &s;eemed praying for me. I was ap|prehen&s;ive of her fainting.

When a little recovered, I could not but &s;tep in to my Jeronyme. He was alone; drying his eyes as he &s;at: But &s;eeing me enter, he bur&s;t out into fre&s;h tears. <HI>Once more, my Jeronymo</HI>&mdash;I would have comforted him; but wanted comfort my&s;elf.</P>

<P>About eleven, according to the Engli&s;h numbering of the hours, I &s;ent to know how the whole family did. Father Mare&s;cotti returned with my &s;ervant. He told me, that the Lady fainted away after I was gone: But went to re&s;t as &s;oon as recovered. They all were in grief, he &s;aid. He was charged with the be&s;t wi&s;hes, and with the ble&s;&s;ings, of every one; with tho&s;e of the two Marchione&s;&s;es in particular. Signor Jero|nymo was &s;o ill, that one of his Italian &s;urgeons pro|po&s;ed to fit up with him all night; for Mr. Lowther had de&s;ired to accompany me as far as Modena: And him I charged with my compliments to each per&s;on of the family; and with my remembrances to &s;ervants, who well de&s;erved kindne&s;s from me; and who, Fa|ther Mare&s;cotti told me, were all in tears on my de|parture. I prevailed on the Father him&s;elf to make my acknowlegements to the good Camilla. He offer|ed, and I thankfully accepted of, his prayers for my health and happine&s;s, which he put up in the mo&s;t &s;ervent manner, on his knees; and then embracing me, with a tenderne&s;s truly paternal, we parted, ble&s;&s;|ing each other.</P>
<P>This morning early, I &s;et out. The Count of Bel|vedere rejoiced to &s;ee me; and called me kind, for being his gue&s;t, though but for one night; for I &s;hall pur&s;ue my journey in the morning. He a&s;&s;ures me, that he will make me a vi&s;it in England.</P>

<P>I Set out from Parma early on Tue&s;day morning, as I intended. The Count of Belvedere was &s;o ob|liging, as to accompany me to Pavia, where we parted with mutual civilities.</P>
<P>I paid my re&s;pects to Lady Sforza at Milan, as I had promi&s;ed. She received me with great politene&s;s. Our conver&s;ation chiefly turned on the differences be|tween the other branches of her family, on one part; and her&s;elf, and Lady Laurana, on the other. She owned, that when &s;he &s;ent to de&s;ire a vi&s;it from me, &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed, that the alliance between them and me was a thing concluded upon; and that &s;he intend|ed, by my mediation, to reconcile her&s;elf to the fa|mily, if they would meet her half-way.</P>
<P>She was &s;o indi&s;creet, as they lay general blame on her noble niece, as a per&s;on given up to a zeal that wanted government: She threw out hints, injurious to the &s;incerity of the three brothers, as well as to that of the father and mother, with regard to me: All which I di&s;countenanced.</P>
<P>I have hardly ever conver&s;ed with a woman &s;o art|ful as Lady Sforza. I wonder not, that &s;he had the addre&s;s to fire the Count of Belvedere with impa|tience, and to &s;et him on &s;eeking to provoke me to an act of ra&s;hne&s;s, which, after what had happened be|tween me and the young Count Altieri, &s;ome years ago, at Verona, might have been fatal to one, if not to both; and, by that means, rid Italy, if not the world, of me, and, at the &s;ame time, revenged her|&s;elf on the Count, for rejecting her daughter, who, as I have told you before, has a pa&s;&s;ion for him, in a
<PB N="252" REF="253">
manner that &s;he called too contemptuous to be pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>She told me, that &s;he doubted not <HI>now,</HI> that I had been circumvented, by (what even &s;he, an Italian, called) <HI>Italian fine&s;&s;e,</HI> but her niece would be pre|vailed upon to marry the Count; and bid me mind her words. Ah, my poor Laurana! added &s;he&mdash;But I will renounce her, if &s;he can be &s;o mean, as to re|tain Love for a man who de&s;pi&s;es her.</P>
<P>A convent, &s;he &s;aid, after &s;uch a malady as Cle|mentina had been afflicted with, would be the fitte&s;t place for her. She a&s;cribed to hers and Laurana's treatment of her (with great vehemence, on my di&s;|allowing her a&s;&s;ertion) the foundation of her cure. She wi&s;hed that, were Clementina to marry, it might have been me, preferably to any other man; &s;ince the Love &s;he bore me, was mo&s;t likely to com|plete her recovery; which was not to be expected, were &s;he to marry a man to whom &s;he was indifferent&mdash;But, added &s;he, they mu&s;t take their own way.</P>
<P>Lady Laurana was on a vi&s;it at the Borromean pa|lace: Her mother &s;ent for her, unknown to me. I could very well have excu&s;ed the compliment. I was civil, however: I could be no more than civil: And, after a &s;tay of two hours, pur&s;ued my route.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened in my journey. I wrote to Jeronymo, and his beloved Si&s;ter, from Ly|ons.</P>
<P>At the po&s;t-hou&s;e there, I found a &s;ervant of Lady Olivia, with a Letter. He was ordered to overtake, and give it into my own hands, were he to travel with it to Paris, or even to England. Lady Olivia will be obeyed. The man mi&s;&s;ed me, by my going to vi&s;it Lady Sforza at Milan. I inclo&s;ed the Letter; as al&s;o a copy of mine, to which it is an an&s;wer. When you read them, you will be of opinion, that they ought not to pa&s;s your own hands. Perhaps you will choo&s;e to read them in this place.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Saturday, Aug. <HI>19-30.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, at la&s;t, is the day approaching, that the writer of this will be allowed to con&s;ider him|&s;elf wholly as an Engli&s;hman. He is preparing to take, perhaps, an everla&s;ting leave of Italy. But could he do this, and not fir&s;t bid adieu to two Ladies at Florence, who&s;e welfare will be ever dear to him&mdash;Lady Olivia, and Mrs. Beaumont? It mu&s;t be to both by Letter.</P>
<P>I told you, madam, when I la&s;t attended you, that po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hould never &s;ee you more. If I told you &s;o in anger, pardon me. Now, in a farewel Letter, I would not upbraid you. I will be all in fault, if you plea&s;e. I never incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of Olivia, but I was more concerned for her, than for what I &s;uffered from it; and yet her di&s;plea&s;ure was not a matter of indifference to me.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h not, madam, for my own happine&s;s, with more &s;incerity than I do for yours. Would to Hea|ven it were in my power to promote it! I will flatter my&s;elf, that my true regard for your honour, daugh|ter as you are of a hou&s;e next to princely, and of for|tune more than princely, will give me an influence, which will awaken you to your glory. Allow, madam, the friendly, the brotherly expo&s;tulation&mdash;Let me think, let me &s;peak, of Olivia, in ab&s;ence, as a fond brother would of a &s;i&s;ter mo&s;t dear to him. I <HI>will</HI> &s;o &s;peak, &s;o think of you, madam, when far di&s;tant from you. When I remember my Italian friends, it will always be with tender ble&s;&s;ings, and the mo&s;t affecti|onate gratitude. Allow me, Olivia, to number you with the deare&s;t of tho&s;e friends. Your honour, your welfare, pre&s;ent and future, is, and ever will be, the object of my vows.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="255">
God and nature have done their parts by you. Let not your own be wanting. To what purpo&s;e live we, if not to grow wi&s;er, and to &s;ubdue our <HI>pa&s;&s;ions?</HI> Dear Lady! Illu&s;trious woman! How often have <HI>you</HI> been &s;ubdued by the violence of <HI>yours;</HI> and to what &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions has your generous repentance &s;ubjected you, even to your inferiors! Let me not be thought a boa&s;ter&mdash;But I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that I am the ra|ther intitled to advi&s;e, as I have made it my endeavour (and, I ble&s;s God, have not been always un&s;ucce&s;sful) to curb my pa&s;&s;ions. They are naturally violent. What do I owe to the advice of an excellent man, whom I early &s;et up as <HI>my</HI> monitor? Let me, in this Letter, be <HI>yours.</HI></P>
<P>Your &s;ituation in life, your high birth, your illu&s;tri|ous line of ance&s;tors, are &s;o many calls upon <HI>you,</HI> in whom the riches and the con&s;equence of &s;o many no|ble progenitors centre, to act worthy of their names, of their dignities, of your own; and of the dignity of your Sex. The world looks up to you (your educa|tion, too, &s;o greatly beyond that of mo&s;t Italian La|dies) with the expectation of an example&mdash;Yet have not evil reports already gone out upon your la&s;t ex|cur&s;ion? The world will not &s;ee with our eyes, nor judge as we would have it, and as we &s;ometimes know it <HI>ought</HI> to judge. My vi&s;it to Italy, when you were ab&s;ent from it, and in England, was of &s;ervice to your fame. The malignant world, at pre&s;ent, holds it&s;elf &s;u&s;pended in its cen&s;ures; and expects, from your &s;u|ture conduct, either a confutation or a confirmation of them. It is, therefore, &s;till in your power (rejoice, madam, that it is!) for ever to e&s;tabli&s;h, or for ever to depreciate, your character, in the judgment both of friends and enemies.</P>
<P>How often have I &s;een pa&s;&s;ion, and evenrage, deform features that are really lovely! Shall it be &s;aid, that your great fortune, your abundance, has been a &s;nare to you? That you would have been a happier, nay
<PB N="255" REF="256">
a <HI>better</HI> woman, had not God &s;o bountifully ble&s;&s;ed you?</P>
<P>Can your uatural genero&s;ity of temper allow you to bear &s;uch an imputation, as that the want of power only can keep you within the limits (Pardon, Olivia, the lover of your fame!) which the gentlene&s;s of your Sex, which true honour, pre&s;cribe?</P>
<P>You are a young Lady. Three fourths of your na|tural life (Heaven permitting) are yet to come. You have noble qualities, &s;hining accompli&s;hments. You will probably, in a very few years, perhaps in a few months, be able to e&s;tabli&s;h your&s;elf with the world. So far only as you have gone, the incon&s;ideration of youth will be allowed an excu&s;e for your conduct. Ble&s;t with means, as you are, you <HI>&s;till</HI> have it in your power, let me repeat, to be an honour to your Sex, to your country, to your &s;plendid hou&s;e, and to the age to which you are given.</P>
<P>The monitor I mentioned (You know him by per|&s;on, by manners) from my earlier youth, born as he knew me to be, the heir of a con&s;iderable fortune, &s;ugge&s;ted to me an addre&s;s to Heaven, which my heart has had no repugnance to make a daily one; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Almighty will, in mercy, with-hold from me wealth and affluence, and make my proud heart a dependant one, even for my daily bread, were riches to be a &s;nare to me; and, if I found not my inclinations to do good, as occa&s;ions offered, en|large with my power."</Q>&mdash;O that you, Olivia, were poor and low, if the being &s;o, and nothing el&s;e, would make you <HI>know your&s;elf,</HI> and act accordingly!&mdash;And that it were given to me, by acts of fraternal love, to re&s;tore you, as you could bear it, to an independence, large as your own wi&s;hes!</P>
<P>Wha an uncontroulable MAN would Lady Olivia have made, had &s;he been a man, with but the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, that now dimini&s;h th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;oul, and &s;o large a power to gratify them!&mdash;What a <HI>So|vereign!</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="257">
&mdash;Look into the characters of ab&s;olute princes, and &s;ee who&s;e, of all tho&s;e who have &s;ullied royalty, by the violence of their wills, you would have wi&s;hed to copy, or to have been compared with.</P>
<P>How has the unhappy Olivia, though but a &s;ubject dared!&mdash;How often has that tender bo&s;om, who&s;e glory it would have been to melt at another's woe, and to rejoice in acts of kindne&s;s and benevolence to her fellow-creatures, been armed by her&s;elf (not the mi|&s;tre&s;s, but the &s;lave, of her pa&s;&s;ions) not with defen|&s;ive, but offen&s;ive, &s;teel <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the poniard &s;he wore in her bo&s;om.</NOTE>! Hitherto Providence has averted any remedile&s;s mi&s;chief; but Providence will not be tempted.</P>
<P>Believe me, <HI>&s;till</HI> believe me, madam, I mean not to upbraid you. <HI>My dear</HI> Olivia, I <HI>will</HI> call you, how often has my heart bled for you! How <HI>paternally,</HI> tho' but of years to be your <HI>brother,</HI> have I lamented for you in &s;ecret! I will own to you, that, but for the with-holding prudence, and with-holding honour, that I owned to both our characters, becau&s;e of a &s;itua|tion which would not allow me to expre&s;s my tenderne&s;s for you, I had folded you, in your contrite moments, to my bo&s;om; and, on my knees, be&s;ought you to act up to your own knowlege, and to render your&s;elf worthy of your illu&s;trious ance&s;try. And what but your <HI>glory</HI> could have been, what but that is now, my motive?</P>
<P>With what joy do I reflect, that I took <HI>not</HI> (God be prai&s;ed for his re&s;training goodne&s;s!) advantage of the favour I &s;tood in, with a mo&s;t lovely, and princely|&s;pirited woman; an advantage that would have given me cau&s;e to charge my&s;elf with ba&s;ene&s;s to her, in the hour wherein I &s;hould have wanted mo&s;t con&s;olation! With what apprehen&s;ion (dreading for my&s;elf, becau&s;e of the great, the &s;ometimes almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table, tempta|tion) have I looked upon my&s;elf to be (&s;hall I &s;ay ?) the &s;ole guardian of Olivia's honour! More than once, mo&s;t
<PB N="257" REF="258">
generous and <HI>confiding</HI> of women, have I, from your unmerited favour for me, be&s;ought you to &s;pare me my <HI>pride;</HI> and as often to permit me to &s;pare you <HI>yours</HI>&mdash;Not the odious vice generally known by that name (the fault of fallen angels) but that which may be called a prop, a &s;upport, to an imperfect goodne&s;s which, properly directed, may, in time, grow into vir|tue!&mdash;That friendly pride, let me add, which has ever warmed my heart with wi&s;hes for your temporal and eternal welfare.</P>
<P>I call upon you once more, my FRIEND! How unreproachingly may we call each other by that &s;a|cred name! The Friend of your Fame, the Friend of your Soul, calls upon you once more, to rejoice with him, that you have it &s;till in your power to tread the path of honour. Again I glory, and let us <HI>both,</HI> that we have nothing to reproach each other with. I leave Italy, a country that ever will have a title to my grate|ful regard, without one <HI>&s;elf</HI>-upbraiding &s;igh; though not without <HI>many</HI> &s;ighs. I own it to Olivia. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> requires it. Ju&s;tice to a Lady Olivia loves not; but who de&s;erves, not only hers, but the love of every woman; for &s;he is an ornament to her Sex, and to human nature. Yet, be it known to Olivia, that I am a &s;ufferer by that very magnanimity, for which I revere <HI>her</HI>&mdash;A rejected man!&mdash;Will Olivia rejoice that I am?&mdash;She will. What inequalities are there in the greate&s;t minds? But &s;ubdue them in yours. For your own &s;ake, not for mine, &s;ubdue them. The con|que&s;t will be more glorious to you, than the acqui&s;ition of an empire could be.</P>
<P>Let me conclude, with an humble, but earne&s;t, wi&s;h, that you will cultivate, as once you promi&s;ed me, the friend&s;hip of one of the be&s;t of women, Mrs. Beaumont, di&s;po&s;ed as &s;he, your neighbour, is to cul|tivate yours. I &s;hall then hear often from you, by the pen of that excellent woman. Your compliance with this humble advice will give me, madam, for

your own &s;ake, and for the plea&s;ure I know Mrs. Beau|mont will have in it, the greate&s;t joy that is po&s;&s;ible for you to give to a heart, that overflows with &s;incere wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s: A heart that will rejoice in every opportunity that &s;hall be granted to pro|mote it: For I am, and ever will be,</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XLII.</HI> Lady <HI>OLIVIA,</HI> To Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON.</HI> (Tran&s;lated by Dr. <HI>Bartlett.</HI>)</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Florence, <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 22. <HI>Sept.</HI> 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I am to take it kindly, that you have thought fit to write to the unhappy Olivia before you leave Italy. I could not have expected even this poor &s;avour, after the parting it was your plea&s;ure to call <HI>everla&s;ting.</HI> Cruel man!&mdash;Can I <HI>&s;till</HI> call you &s;o?&mdash;I <HI>did,</HI> before I had this Letter; and was determind, that you &s;hould have rea&s;on to repent your cruelty: But this Letter has almo&s;t reconciled me to you; &s;o far recon|ciled me, however, as to oblige me to lay a&s;ide the intended vengeance that was rolling towards you from &s;lighted Love. You have awakened me to my glory, by your di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, your tender rea&s;onings. Your Letter (for I have era&s;ed one officious pa&s;&s;age in it) is in my bo&s;om all day. It is on my pillow at night. The la&s;t thing, and the fir&s;t thing, do I read it. The con|tents make my re&s;t balmy, my up-ri&s;ing &s;erene. But it was not till I had read it the &s;eventh time, and after I had era&s;ed that obnoxious pa&s;&s;age, that it began to have that happy effect upon me. I was above advice for the fir&s;t day. I could not reli&s;h your rea&s;onings. Re&s;olutions of vengeance had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me wholly.
<PB N="259" REF="260">
What a charm could there be in a <HI>Letter,</HI> that &s;hould make a flighted woman lay a&s;ide her meditated ven|geance? A woman too, that had fallen beneath her|&s;elf in the object of that de&s;pi&s;ed Love.</P>
<P>Allow me, Grandi&s;on, to &s;ay &s;o. In the account of wordly reckoning, it <HI>was</HI> &s;o. And when I thought I hated you, it was &s;o in my <HI>own</HI> account. Yet could you have returned my Love, I would have gloried in my choice: and attributed to envy all the in&s;olent cen&s;ures of maligners.</P>
<P>But even at the &s;eventh peru&s;al, when my indig|nation began to give way, <HI>would</HI> it have given way, had you not, in the &s;ame Letter, hinted, that the proud Bologna had given up all thoghts of a hu&s;band in the man to whom my heart had been &s;o long at|tached?&mdash;Allow me to call her by the name of her city. I love not her, nor her family. I hate them by their own proud names. It is an hereditary hatred, augmented by rivalry, a rivalry that had like to have been a &s;ucce&s;sful one: And is <HI>&s;he</HI> not proud, who, whatever be her motive, can refu&s;e the man, who has rejected a nobler woman? Yet I think I ought to for|give her; for has &s;he not avenged <HI>me?</HI> If <HI>you</HI> are grieved, that &s;he has refu&s;ed you. I am rejoiced. Be the pangs &s;he has &s;o often given me, if po&s;&s;ible, for|gotten!</P>
<P>What a mi&s;erable wretch, however, from my own reflexions, did this intelligence make me! Intelligence that I received before your Letter <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> m  hands. Let me &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf; the contents, I hope, will be the means of ble&s;&s;ings, by purifying my heart!&mdash;And why a mi&s;erable wretch?&mdash;O this man, of &s;entiments the mo&s;t delicate, of life and manners the mo&s;t unblameable; yet of air and behaviour &s;o truly gallant, had it not been for thy forwardne&s;s, Olivia; had it not been for propo&s;als, &s;hame to thy&s;elf! &s;hame to thy &s;ex! <HI>too plainly</HI> intimated to him; pro|po&s;als that owed their exi&s;tence to incon&s;iderate Love;
<PB N="260" REF="261">
a Love mingled, I will now confe&s;s, with pa&s;&s;ions of the darke&s;t hue&mdash;Envy, malice&mdash;and tho&s;e aggravated by de&s;pair&mdash;would, on this di&s;appointment from the Bologna, have offered his hand to the Florentine!&mdash;But now do I own, that it cannot, that it ought not to be. For what, Olivia, is there in the glitter of thy fortune, thy <HI>greate&s;t</HI> dependence, to attract a man, whom worldly grandeur cannot influence? Who has a fortune of his own &s;o ample, that hundreds are the better for it?&mdash;A man, who&s;e oeconomy is regulated by prudence? Who cannot be in &s;uch difficulties as would give &s;ome little merit to the per&s;on who was &s;o happy as to extricate him from them?&mdash;A man, in &s;hort, who takes plea&s;ure in conferring obligations yet never lays him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving returns? Prince of a man! What Prince, King, Emperor, is &s;o truly great as <HI>this</HI> man? And is he not likewi&s;e &s;urrounded by his nobles?&mdash;What a number of people of high interior worth, make up the circle of his acquaintance!</P>
<P>And is there not, cannot there yet be hope; the proud Bologna now (as &s;he is) out of the que&s;tion?&mdash;The Florentine wants not pride; but betrayed by the violence of her temper, &s;he has not had the cau|tion to confine her&s;elf within the bounds of female (&s;hall I &s;ay) <HI>hypocri&s;y?</HI> What &s;he could not hide from her&s;elf, &s;he revailed to the man &s;he loved: But ne|ver, however, was there any other man whom &s;he loved. Upon whom but one man, the haughty ob|ject of her pa&s;&s;ion, did &s;he ever conde&s;cend to look down? Who but he was ever encouraged to look up to her?&mdash;And did not his gentle, his humane, his unreproaching heart, &s;eem to pity rather than de|&s;pi&s;e her, till &s;he was too far engaged? At the time that &s;he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ca&s;t her eyes upon him, his fortune was not high: His father, a man of expence, was living, and likely to live: His &s;i&s;ters, whom he loved as him|&s;elf, were hopele&s;s of obtaining from their father for|tunes
<PB N="261" REF="262">
equal to their rank and education. Olivia knew all this from unerring intelligence. His friends, his Bartlett, his Beauchamp, and others, were not in circum&s;tances, that &s;et them above owing obligations to him, &s;lender as were his own appointments&mdash;<HI>Then</HI> it was that thou, Olivia, valued&s;t thy&s;elf for being ble&s;t with means to make the power of the man thou loved&s;t, as large as his heart. Thou woulde&s;t have ve&s;ted it <HI>all</HI> in him. Thou woulde&s;t have conditioned with him, that this he &s;hould do for one &s;i&s;ter; this for the other; this for one friend; this for another; and &s;till another, to the extent of his wi&s;hes: And with <HI>him,</HI> and the <HI>remainder,</HI> thou woulde&s;t have been happy.</P>
<P>Surely there was &s;ome merit in Olivia's Love.</P>
<P>But, alas! &s;he was not prudent: Her temper, &s;up|po&s;ed to be naturally haughty and violent, hurried her into mea&s;ures too impetuous. The &s;oul of the man &s;he loved, too great to be attracted by riches, by worldly glory, and capable of being happy in a mere competence, was (how can I &s;ay it? I blu&s;h while I write it!) di&s;gu&s;ted by a violence that had not been u&s;ed to be re&s;trained by the accu&s;tomed re&s;erve. It was all open day, no dark machinating night, in the heart of the undi&s;&s;embling Olivia. She per&s;ecuted the object of her pa&s;&s;ion with her Love, becau&s;e &s;he thought &s;he could lay him under obligation to it. By hoping to prove her&s;elf more, &s;he made her&s;elf appear le&s;s than woman. She de&s;pi&s;ed that affectation, that hy|pocrify, in her Sex, which unpenetrating eyes attri|bute to mode&s;ty and &s;hame&mdash;Shame of what! of a natural pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>But you, Grandi&s;on, were too <HI>delicate,</HI> to be taken with her <HI>&s;incerity.</HI> If you had penetration to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between re&s;erve and openne&s;s of heart, you had not greatne&s;s of mind enough to break thro' the low re&s;traints of cu&s;tom; and to reward the latter in pre|ference to the former. Yet who, better than you,
<PB N="262" REF="263">

<P>And mu&s;t &s;he yield to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own unworthine&s;s, from a propo&s;al made by her&s;elf, which tyrant cu&s;tom only can condemn?</P>
<P>O yes, &s;he mu&s;t. There is, among your coun|trywomen, one who &s;eems born for <HI>you,</HI> and you for <HI>her.</HI> If <HI>&s;he</HI> can abate of a digni y, that a fir&s;t and only Love alone can gratify, and accept of a &s;econd|placed Love a widower-batchelor, as I may call you, <HI>&s;he,</HI> I know, mu&s;t, will, be the happy-woman. To <HI>her</HI> the &s;lighted Florentine can re&s;ign, which, with pa|tience, &s;he never could to the proud Bologna; and the &s;ooner, becau&s;e of the immortal hatred &s;he bears to that woman of Bologna.

I loved, yet feared her, the moment I &s;aw her. I dared not to try my|&s;elf by her judgment.

I di&s;dain thee, Grandi&s;on, in this light. I will tear thy proud image from my heart, or die.</P>
<P>One reque&s;t only, let me make, and permit your pride to comply with it. Return not to me, but ac|cept (accept as a token of Love) the cabinets which perhaps will be in England before you. They will be thought by you of too great value; but they are not too great for the grandeur of my fortune, and the magnificence of my &s;pirit. The medals alone, make a collection that would do credit to the cabinet of a &s;overeign Prince. The&s;e are in your ta&s;te. They are <HI>nothing</HI> to Olivia, but for your &s;ake. Accept of the&s;e cabinets, as &s;ome atonement for the trouble I have given you; for the attempts I have made upon your liberty, and more than once (but Oh! with how feeble a hand!) upon your life! How ea&s;y had it been to take the latter, your &s;oul &s;o fearle&s;s, braving menace and danger, had I been re&s;oved to take it!

<P>All that I a&s;k of you now, that the Bologna, in di&s;appointing <HI>you,</HI> has di&s;appointed <HI>her&s;elf</HI> (great re|venge!) is within your own power to grant, without detriment to your&s;elf, and, I hope, without regret. It con&s;i&s;ts of two or three articles: The fir&s;t is, to re|&s;olve within your&s;elf, that you will not <HI>now,</HI> &s;hould that heat of the zealot's imagination, which has &s;eemed to carry her above her&s;elf, &s;ub&s;ide (as I have no doubt but it <HI>will;)</HI> and &s;hould &s;he even follow you to your native place, as a &s;till nobler woman ignobly did; that you will not now receive her offered hand!&mdash;O Grandi&s;on!

<P>Next, that you will (thus fairly, tho' <HI>fooli&s;hly,</HI> di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and the whole family rejoicing in your di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, well as they pretend to love you) put it out of your own power, &s;ince the Florentine can have no hope, to give the Bologne&s;e any.

<P>Preach not to me, Grandi&s;on, again&s;t that &s;pirit of revenge, which ever did, and ever mu&s;t, actuate my heart. Slighted Love will warrant it, or nothing can! Have I not lo&s;t the man I loved by it? Can I regain him, if I conquer that not ignoble vehemence of a great mind?&mdash;No!&mdash;Forbear then the unavailing precept. I am not of Bologna. I am no zealot! While the warm blood flows in my veins, I pretend not to be above human nature. When I can dive&s;t my&s;elf of that, <HI>then,</HI> perhaps, I may follow your advice: I may &s;eek to cultivate the friend&s;hip of Mrs. Beaumont: But <HI>till</HI> then, &s;he would not accept of mine.</P>

<P>My third reque&s;t is (as before reque&s;ted) that you will not refu&s;e the cabinets which will be &s;oon embark|ed for you. Be not <HI>afraid</HI> of me, Grandi&s;on; I form no preten&s;ions upon you from this pre&s;ent; valuable as you, perhaps, may think it. Your &s;imple accept|ance is all the return I hope for.

<HEAD>Continuation of Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON</HI>'s Letter. No. <HI>XL.</HI> Begun <HI>p. 251.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OLIVIA, you &s;ee, my dear Dr. Bartlett, con|cludes her Letter, with a de&s;ire of corre&s;ponding with me. As &s;he has put it, I cannot refu&s;e her re|que&s;t. How happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf, if I could be a means effectually to &s;erve her in the conduct of her future life!</P>
<P>I have written to her, that I &s;hall think an inter|cour&s;e by Letters an honour done me, if &s;he will allow me to treat her with the freedom and the &s;ingle|ne&s;s of heart of an affectionate brother.</P>
<P>As to her particular recommendation of a <HI>third per|&s;on,</HI> I tell her, that mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of the future corre&s;pondence to which &s;he is plea&s;ed to invite me.</P>
<P>Olivia <HI>may be</HI> in earne&s;t, in her warm com|mendations of a Lady, of who&s;e excellencies no|body can write or &s;peak with indifference: But I have no doubt, that &s;he is very earne&s;t to know my &s;entiments on the &s;ubject. But what mu&s;t be the mind of the <HI>bachelor-widower,</HI> as &s;he calls me, if already I can enter into the &s;ubject with <HI>any</HI>-body, with Lady Olivia e&s;pecially? The mo&s;t <HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI> I will not &s;ay <HI>&s;ubtle</HI> creature on earth, is certainly a woman in Love. What can e&s;cape her penetration? What can bound her curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I tell her, that I can neither decline nor accept of her pre&s;ent, till I &s;ee the contents of the cabinets &s;he is plea&s;ed to mention. It will give me pain, I &s;ay, to refu&s;e any favour from Lady Olivia, by which &s;he intends to &s;hew her e&s;teem of me: But favours of &s;o high a price, will, and ought to, give &s;cruples to one who would not be thought ungenerous.</P>
<P>I had always admired, I tell her, her collection of medals: But they are a family collection, of two or three generations: And I &s;hould not allow my&s;elf to accept of &s;uch a trea&s;ure, unle&s;s I could have an op|portunity
<PB N="268" REF="269">
given me to &s;hew, if not my merit, my gra|titude; and <HI>that</HI> I &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibility of being ble&s;&s;ed with, in any manner, that could make the acceptance tolerably ea&s;y to my&s;elf. I cannot, my dear Dr. Bart|lett, receive from this munificent Lady a pre&s;ent that is of &s;uch high intrin&s;ic worth. Had &s;he offered me any-thing that would have had its value <HI>from</HI> the giver, or <HI>to</HI> the receiver, for its own &s;ake, and not equally to any-body el&s;e; for in&s;tance, had &s;he de&s;ired me to accept of her picture, &s;ince the original could not me mine; I would not have refu&s;ed it, tho' it had been incircled with jewels of price. But, circum&s;tanced as this unhappy Lady and I are, could I have a&s;ked her for a favour of that nature?</P>
<P>I think, I have broken thro' one delicacy, in con|&s;enting to corre&s;pond with this Lady. She &s;hould not have a&s;ked it. I never knew a pain of &s;o particular a nature as this Lady (a not ungenerous, tho' a ra&s;h one) has given me. My very heart recoils, Dr. Bart|lett, at the thought of a denial of marriage to a wo|man expecting the offer, whom delicacy has not quite for&s;aken.</P>
<P>But a word or two more on this &s;ubject of Pre&s;ents. When the whole family at Bologna were &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicitous to &s;hew their gratitude to me by &s;ome per|manent token, I had once the thought of a&s;king for their Clementina's picture in miniature: But as I was never to think of her as mine, and as, probably, my picture, if but for politene&s;s &s;ake, would have been a&s;ked for in exchange, I was afraid of cheri&s;hing, by that means, in her mind, the tender ideas of our pa&s;t friend&s;hip, and thereby of making the work of her parents difficult. And do they not the more <HI>excu&s;ably</HI> hope to &s;ucceed in their views, as they think their &s;uc|ce&s;s will be a means to &s;ecure health of mind to their child? But if they vi&s;it me in England, I will then reque&s;t the pictures of the whole family, in one large piece, for the principal ornament of Grandi&s;on-hall.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="270">
By what Olivia &s;ays, of de&s;igns on my liberty, I be|lieve &s;he means to include the attempt made upon me at Florence; which I hinted at in my la&s;t, and &s;up|po&s;ed to come from that quarter. What &s;he would have done with me, had the attempt &s;ucceeded, I can|not imagine. I &s;hould not have wi&s;hed to have been the &s;ubject of &s;o romantic an adventure&mdash;A pri&s;oner to a Lady in her ca&s;tle!&mdash;She is certainly one of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing women in Italy; and her temper is too well &s;econded by her power. She would not, however, in that ca&s;e, have had recour&s;e to <HI>fatal</HI> acts of violence. Once, you know, &s;he had thoughts of exciting again&s;t me the Holy Tribunal: But I was up|on &s;uch a foot, as a traveller, and as an Engli&s;h Pro|te&s;tant, tho' avowed, not behaving indi&s;creetly, that I had friends enow, even in the Sacred College, to have rendered ineffectual any &s;teps of that &s;ort. And after all, her machinations were but tran&s;itory ones, and, the moment &s;he &s;aw me, given over.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t enquiry, after my arrival here, was after my poor cou&s;in Grandi&s;on. My <HI>poor</HI> cou&s;in, indeed! What a &s;piritle&s;s figure does he make! I remember you once &s;aid, That it was more difficult for a man to behave well in pro&s;perity, than in adver&s;ity: But the man who will prove the ob&s;ervation to be true, mu&s;t not be one, who, by his own extravagance and vice, has reduced him&s;elf, from an affluence to which he was born, to penury, at lea&s;t to a &s;tate of obligation and dependence. Good God! that a man &s;hould be &s;o infatuated, as to put on the ca&s;t of a dye, the e&s;tate of which he is in <HI>unque&s;tioned</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from his an|ce&s;tors! Yet who will &s;ay, that he who hopes to win what belongs to another, does not de&s;erve to lo&s;e his own?</P>
<P>I &s;oothed my cou&s;in in the be&s;t manner I could, con|&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice: Yet I told him, that his repent|ance mu&s;t ari&s;e from his <HI>judgment,</HI> as well as from his <HI>&s;ufferings;</HI> and that he would have le&s;s rea&s;on for re|gretting
<PB N="270" REF="271">
the unhappy &s;ituation to which he had reduced him&s;elf, if the latter brought him to a right &s;en&s;e of his errors. I was &s;olicitous, Dr. Bartlett, for the &s;ake of his own peace of mind, that he &s;hould fall into a proper train of thinking: But I told him, that preach|ment was no more my intention, than recrimination.</P>
<P>I have two hands to one tongue, my cou&s;in, &s;aid I; and the latter I u&s;e not but to tell you, that both the former are cordially at your &s;ervice. You have con|&s;idered this matter well, no doubt, added I: Can you propo&s;e to me any means of retrieving your affairs?</P>
<P>There is, &s;aid he, one way. It would do every|thing for me: But I am afraid of mentioning it to you.</P>
<P>If it be a ju&s;t way, fear not. If it be any-thing I can do for you, out of my own &s;ingle pur&s;e, without a&s;king any &s;econd or third per&s;on to contribute to it, command me&mdash;He he&s;itated.</P>
<P>If it be any-thing, my cou&s;in, &s;aid I, that you think I ought not, in ju&s;tice, in honour, to comply with, do <HI>not,</HI> for your own &s;ake, mention it. Let me &s;ee that your calamity has had a proper effect upon you. Let not the <HI>just man</HI> be &s;unk in the man in adver&s;ity; and then open your mind freely to me.</P>
<P>He could not, he &s;aid, tru&s;t the mention of the ex|pedient to me, till he had given it a further con&s;ider|ation.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, be plea&s;ed to remember, that I will never <HI>a&s;k</HI> you to mention it; becau&s;e I cannot doubt but you <HI>will,</HI> if, on con&s;ideration, you think it a <HI>proper</HI> expedient.</P>
<P>When &s;ome friends, who came to vi&s;it me on my arrival, were gone, my cou&s;in re&s;umed the former &s;ub|ject: But he offered not to mention his expedient. I hope it was not, that he had a view to my Emily. I am very jealous for my Emily. If I thought poor Everard had but an imagination of retrieving his affairs
<PB N="271" REF="272">
by her fortune, nothing but his pre&s;ent calamity &s;hould hinder me from reneuncing for ever my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>I enquired particularly into the &s;ituation he was in; and if there were a likelihood of doing any-thing with the game&s;ters. But he could not give me room for &s;uch an expectation. I find he has lo&s;t all his e&s;tate to them, Dunton-farm excepted; which, having been much out of repair, is now fitting up for a new te|nant; and will not, for three or four years to come, bring him in a clear fifty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I have known more men than one, who could not live upon fifteen hundred a year, bring them&s;elves to be contented with fifty. But Mr. Grandi&s;on is &s;o fallen in &s;pirit, that he never will be able to &s;urvive &s;uch a change of fortune, if I do not befriend him. Poor man! he is but the &s;hadow of what he was. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> formerly in the fa&s;hion: In body and face &s;o erect; his &s;teps &s;o firm, gait &s;o a&s;&s;ured, air &s;o gen|teel, eye &s;o lively&mdash;But now, in &s;o few months, gaunt &s;ides; his half-worn tarni&s;h'd-laced coat, big enough to lap over him; hollow cheeks, puling voice, &s;igh|ing heart, creeping feet&mdash;O my Dr. Bartlett, how much does it behove men &s;o little able to <HI>bear</HI> di&s;tre&s;s, to avoid falling into it by their own extravagance! But for a man to fall into indigence thro' <HI>avarice</HI> (for what is a &s;pirit of gaming, but a &s;pirit of avarice, and that of the wor&s;t &s;ort?) How can &s;uch a one &s;upport his own reflexions?</P>
<P>I had &s;uppo&s;ed, that he had no rea&s;on, in this &s;hat|tered &s;tate of his affairs, to apprehend any-thing from the pro&s;ecution &s;et on foot by the woman who claimed him on promi&s;e of marriage; but I was mi&s;taken; &s;he has, or pretends to have, he told me, witne&s;&s;es of the promi&s;e. Poor &s;hameful man! What witne&s;&s;es <HI>needed</HI> &s;he, if he <HI>knows</HI> he made it, and received the pro&s;tigate con&s;ideration?</P>
<P>I am not happy, my dear friend, in my mind. I hope to be tolerably &s;o, if my next Letters from Bo|logna
<PB N="272" REF="273">
are favourable, as to the &s;tate of health of the beloved brother and &s;i&s;ter there.</P>
<P>It would have been no di&s;agreeable amu&s;ement to me, at this time, to have proceeded directly to Ireland; the rather, as I hope a vi&s;it to my e&s;tate there is become almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, by the forwardne&s;s the works are in which I &s;et on foot when I was on that more than agreeable &s;pot.

<P>COngratulate us, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, on the arrival of my brother. He came la&s;t night. It was late. And he &s;ent to us this morning; and to others of his friends. My Lord and I hurried away to breakfa&s;t with him. Ah, my dear! we &s;ee too plainly that he has been very much di&s;turbed in mind. He looks more wan, and is thinner, than he was: But he is the &s;ame kind brother, friend, and good man.</P>
<P>I expected a little hint or two from him on my pa&s;t vivacities; but not a word of that nature. He felicitated my good man and me; and when he &s;poke of Lord and Lady L. and his joy in their happine&s;s,
<PB N="273" REF="274">
he put two &s;i&s;ters and their good men together, as two of the happie&s;t pairs in England. Politic enough; for as we &s;at at breakfa&s;t, two or three <HI>toy&s;ome</HI> things were &s;aid by my Lord (no ape was ever &s;o fond!) and I could hardly forbear him: But the reputation my brother <HI>gave</HI> me, was a re&s;traint upon me. I &s;ee, one may be flattered, by under&s;erved compliments, into good behaviour, when we have a regard to the com|plimenter.</P>
<P>Aunt Nell was all joy and gladne&s;s: She was in raptures la&s;t night, it &s;eems, at her nephew's fir&s;t ar|rival. He rejoiced to &s;ee her; and was &s;o thankful to her for letting him find her in town, and at his hou&s;e, that &s;he re&s;olves &s;he will not leave him till he is mar|ried. The good old &s;oul imagines &s;he is of import|ance to him, in the direction of the family matters, now I have left him&mdash;<HI>I,</HI> Harriet! there's &s;elf-import|ance!&mdash;But, good creatures, the&s;e old virgins! they do &s;o love to be thought u&s;eful&mdash;Well, and is not that a good &s;ign, on aunt Nell's part? Does it not look as if &s;he would have been an u&s;eful creature in the days of nightrail and notablene&s;s, had &s;he been a wife in good time? I always think, when I &s;ee tho&s;e badgerly virgins fond of a parrot, a &s;quirrel, a monkey, or a lap-dog, that their imagination makes our hu&s;band and children in the animals&mdash;Poor things!&mdash;But as to her care, I dare &s;ay, that will only &s;erve to make bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion, where el&s;e would be order and regularity; for my brother has the be&s;t of &s;ervants.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed her in in Berk&s;hire fifty times, as we &s;at at breakfa&s;t: For when I wanted to a&s;k my brother twenty thou&s;and que&s;tions, and to &s;et him on talking, we were entertained with her dreams of the night be|fore his arrival, and la&s;t night&mdash;Seas cro&s;&s;ed, rivers forded&mdash;Dangers e&s;caped by the help of angels and &s;aints, for the re&s;veries of the former night; and for the la&s;t, the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres, heaven, and joy, and fe&s;tivity&mdash;The plump creature loves good chear,
<PB N="274" REF="275">
Harriet.&mdash;In &s;hort, hardly a word could we &s;ay, but what put her upon recollecting a part of one of her dreams: Yet, &s;ome excu&s;e lies good, for an old &s;oul, who&s;e whole life has been but one dream, a little fal-lal|i&s;hly varied&mdash;And, would you think it? (yes, I believe you would) <HI>My</HI> odd creature was once or twice put upon endeavouring to recollect two or three dreams of his own, of the week pa&s;t; and would have gone on, if I had not &s;ilenced him by a frown, as he looked upon me for his cue, as a tender hu&s;band ought.</P>
<P>Beauchamp came in, and I thought would have relieved us: But he put my aunt in mind of an almo&s;t|forgotten part of her dream; for <HI>ju&s;t</HI> &s;uch a joyful meeting, <HI>ju&s;t</HI> &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of gladne&s;s, did &s;he dream of, as &s;he now beheld, and heard, between my brother and him felicitating each other. Duce take the&s;e dreaming &s;ouls, to remember their re&s;|veries, when realities infinitely more affecting are be|fore them! But Reflexion and Progno&s;tic are ever in|&s;piriting parts of the preten&s;ion of people who have lived long; dead to the Pre&s;ent; the Pa&s;t and the Future filling their minds: And why &s;hould not they be indulged in the thought that they know &s;ome|thing more than tho&s;e who are le&s;s ab&s;tracted; and who are contented with looking no further than the Pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>Sir Charles enquired after Sir Harry's health. Mr. Beauchamp, with a concern that did him credit, lamented his declining way; and he &s;poke &s;o re&s;pect|fully of Lady Beauchamp, and of her tenderne&s;s to his father, as made my brother's eyes gli&s;ten with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. Dr. Bartlett, and Emily, were at Colnebrook: But as they had left orders to be &s;ent for, the moment my brother arrived) for you need not doubt but his la&s;t Letter prepared us to expect him &s;oon) they came time enough to dine with us. There was a renewal of joy among us.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">
Emily, the dear Emily fainted away, embracing the knees of her guardian, as &s;he, unawares to him, threw her&s;elf at his feet, with joy that laboured for expre&s;&s;ion, but could not obtain it. He was affected. So was Beauchamp. So were we all. She was car|ried out, ju&s;t as &s;he was recovering to a &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face, for which only her own mode&s;ty could reproach her.</P>
<P>There are &s;u&s;ceptibilities which will &s;hew them&s;elves in outward acts; and there are others which cannot bur&s;t out into &s;peech. Lady L's joy was of the for|mer, mine of the latter, &s;ort. But &s;he is u&s;ed to tenderne&s;s of heart. Mine are ready to bur&s;t my heart, but never hardly can ri&s;e to my lips&mdash;My eyes, however, are great talkers.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure that Sir Charles, Lord L. and Dr. Bartlett, mutually expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee each other, was great, tender, and manly. My bu&s;tling nimble Lord enjoyed over again his joy, at that of every other per|&s;on; and he was ready, good-naturedly, to &s;ing and dance&mdash;That's <HI>his</HI> way, poor man, to &s;hew his joy; but he is hone&s;t, for all that. Don't de&s;pi&s;e him, Harriet! He was brought up as an only &s;on, and to know that he was a Lord, or el&s;e he would have made a better figure in <HI>your eyes.</HI> The man wants not &s;en&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you. You may think me partial; but I believe the mo&s;t fooli&s;h thing he ever did in his life, was at church, and that at St. George's, Hanover-&s;quare. Poor &s;oul! He <HI>might</HI> have had a wife better &s;uited to his ta&s;te, and then his very foibles would have made him &s;hine. But, Harriet, it is not always given to us to know what is be&s;t for our&s;elves. Black women, I have heard remarked, like fair men; fair men, black women; and tempers &s;uit be&s;t with contraries. Were we all to like the &s;ame per&s;on or thing equally, we &s;hould be for-ever engaged in bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">: As it <HI>is,</HI> human nature (<HI>vile rogue!</HI> as I have heard it called) is quarrel&s;ome enough: So my Lord, being a lo&s;t man, <HI>fell in love,</HI>

But I am very good to him <HI>now.</HI> I don't know, Harriet, whether it is be&s;t for me to break him of his trifling, or not: Unle&s;s one were &s;ure, that he could creditably &s;upport the al|teration. Now can I laugh at him; and, if the baby is froppi&s;h, can coax him into good humour. A &s;u|gar-plumb, and a courte&s;y, will do at any time; and, by &s;etting him into a broad grin, I can laugh away his anger. But &s;hould I endeavour to make him wi&s;e, as the man has not been u&s;ed to it, and as his edu|cation has not given him a turn to &s;ignificance, don't you think he would he would be aukward; and, what is wor&s;e, a&s;&s;uming? Well, I'll con&s;ider of this, before I at|tempt to new-ca&s;t him. Mean time, I repeat&mdash;Don't you, my dear, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, think meanly of Lord G.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, hah!&mdash;What do I laugh at, do you a&s;k me, Harriet?&mdash;Something &s;o highly ridiculous&mdash;I have&mdash;I have&mdash;&s;ent him away from me, &s;o much a&s;hamed of him&s;elf&mdash;He bears any-thing from me <HI>now,</HI> that he knows I am only in play with him, and have &s;o <HI>very</HI> right a heart&mdash;I mu&s;t lay down my pen&mdash;Poor &s;oul! Hah, hah, hah, hah!&mdash;I do love him for his &s;implicity!</P>
<P>WELL, I won't tell you what I laughed at ju&s;t now, for fear you &s;hould laugh at us both. My brother's arrival has tuned every &s;tring of my heart to joy. The holding up of a &s;traw will throw me into <HI>tittera|tion</HI>&mdash;I can hardly forbear laughing again, to think of the &s;hame the poor &s;oul &s;hewed, when he &s;lunk away from me. After all, he ill brooks to be laughed at. Does not that look as if he were con&s;cious?&mdash;But what, Harriet (will you a&s;k) mean I, by thus trifling with you, and at <HI>this</HI> time particularly?&mdash;Why, I would be glad to make you &s;mile, either <HI>with</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="278">
me, or <HI>at</HI> me: I am indifferent which, &s;o that you do but &s;mile&mdash;You do!&mdash;I prote&s;t you do!&mdash;Well! now that I have obtained my wi&s;hes, I will be &s;erious.</P>
<P>We congratulated my brother on the happy turn in the healths of his Italian friends, without naming names, or &s;aying a word of the &s;i&s;ter we had like to have had. He looked earne&s;tly at each of us; bowed to our congratulations; but was &s;ilent. Dr. Bartlett had told us, that he never, in his Letters to my bro|ther, mentioned your being not well; becau&s;e he knew it would di&s;turb him. He had many things to order and do; &s;o that, except at breakfa&s;t, when aunt Nell invaded us with her dreams, and at dinner, when the &s;ervants attendance made our di&s;cour&s;e general, we had hardly any opportunity of talking to him. But in the &s;pace between tea-time and &s;upper, he came and told us, that he was devoted to us for the remain|der of the day. Per&s;ons pre&s;ent were, Lord and Lady L. my&s;elf, and my good man, Dr. Bartlett, Mr. Beauchamp, and Emily, good girl! quite recovered, and blyth as a bird, attentive to every word that pa&s;&s;|ed the lips of her guardian&mdash;O, but aunt Nell was al&s;o pre&s;ent!&mdash;Poor &s;oul! I had like to have forgot her!</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, you mu&s;t take it for granted, that we all owned, we had &s;een mo&s;t of what he had writ|ten to Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>What troubles, what angui&s;h of mind, what a &s;trange variety of conflicts, has your heart had to con|tend with, my dear Sir Charles, began Mr. Beau|champ; and, at la&s;t, What a &s;trange di&s;appointment, from one of the noble&s;t of women!</P>
<P>Very true, my Beauchamp. He then &s;aid great and glorious things of Lady Clementina. We all joined in admiring her. He &s;eemed to have great plea|&s;ure in hearing us prai&s;e her&mdash;Very <HI>true,</HI> Harriet?&mdash;But you have genero&s;ity enough to be plea&s;ed with him for that.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="279">
Aunt Eleanor (I won't call her aunt Nell any more if I can help it) a&s;ked him, If he thought it were po&s;|&s;ible for the Lady to hold her re&s;olution? Now you have actually left Italy, nephew, and are at &s;uch a di&s;tance, don't you think her love will return?</P>
<P>Good &s;oul! She has <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> notions &s;till left, I find, of <HI>ideal</HI> Love! Tho&s;e notions, I fan&s;y, la&s;t a long time, with tho&s;e who have not had the opportu|nity of gratifying the <HI>&s;illy</HI> pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Be angry, if you will, Harriet, I don't care.</P>
<P>Well, but, thus gravely, as became the que&s;tion, an|&s;wered my brother&mdash;The favour which this incompar|able Lady honoured me with, was never di&s;owned: On the contrary, it was always avowed, and to the very la&s;t. She had therefore no uncertainty to con|tend with: She had no balancings in her mind. Her contention, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, was altogether in favour of her duty to Heaven. She is exemplarily pious. While &s;he remains a zealous Roman Catholic, &s;he mu&s;t per&s;evere; and I dare &s;ay &s;he will.</P>
<P>I don't know what to make of the&s;e <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> &s;aid our old Prote&s;tant aunt Nell&mdash;(Aunt Nell, did I &s;ay? Cry mercy!)&mdash;Thank God you are come home &s;afe and &s;ound, and without a <HI>papi&s;tical</HI> wife!&mdash;It is very hard, if England cannot find a wife for you, nephew.</P>
<P>We all &s;miled at aunt Nell&mdash;The duce is in me, I believe!&mdash;Aunt Nell again!&mdash;But let it go.</P>
<P>When, Lady G. (a&s;ked Lady L.) &s;aw you or heard you from, the dowager Counte&s;s of D.?</P>
<P>Is there any other Counte&s;s of D. Lady L.? &s;aid Sir Charles: A fine glow taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his cheeks.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, brother, thought I; I am not &s;orry for your charming apprehen&s;ivene&s;s.</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied Lady L.</P>
<P>Would you, brother, &s;aid <HI>Boldface</HI> (You know who that is, Harriet) that there <HI>&s;hould</HI> be another Counte&s;s of D.?</P>

<P>I believe I do, Lady G. I wi&s;h Mi&s;s Byron to be one of the happie&s;t women in the world, becau&s;e &s;he is one of the be&s;t&mdash;My dear, to Emily, I hope you have had nothing to di&s;turb or vex you, from your mother's hu&s;band&mdash;</P>

<P>That's well, my dear&mdash;Would not the Bath-wa|ters be good for Sir Harry? my dear Beauchamp.</P>
<P>A &s;econd remove, thought I! But I'll catch you, brother, I'll warrant (as ru&s;tics &s;ometimes, in their play, do a ball) on the rebound.</P>
<P>Now you will be piqued, I warrant, Harriet. Your delicacy will be offended, becau&s;e I urged the que&s;tion. I &s;ee a blu&s;h of di&s;dain ari&s;ing in your lovely cheek, and con&s;cious eye, re&s;toring the ro&s;es to the one, and its natural brilliancy to the other. Indeed we all be|gan to be afraid of a little affectation in my brother. But we needed not. He would not &s;uffer us to put him upon the &s;ubject again. After a few other gene|ral que&s;tions and an&s;wers, of <HI>who</HI> and <HI>who;</HI> and <HI>how</HI> and <HI>how;</HI> and <HI>what,</HI> and <HI>when,</HI> and-&s;o-forth; he turned to Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>My dear friend, &s;aid he, you gave me pain a little while ago, when I a&s;ked you after the health of Mi&s;s Byron, and her friends: You evaded my que&s;tion, I thought, and your looks alarmed me. I am afraid poor Mrs. Shirley&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron &s;poke of her always as in an infirm &s;tate: How, Charlotte, would our dear Mi&s;s Byron grieve, were &s;he to lo&s;e &s;o good a rela|tion!</P>
<P>I intended not, an&s;wered the Doctor, that you &s;hould <HI>&s;ee</HI> I was concerned: But I think it impo&s;&s;i|ble,
<PB N="280" REF="281">
ble, that a father can love a daughter better than I love Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>You would alarm me indeed, my dear friend, if Lady G. had not, by her u&s;ual <HI>liveline&s;s</HI> ju&s;t now, put me out of all apprehen&s;ions for the health of Mi&s;s By|ron. I hope Mi&s;s Byron is well.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he is not, &s;aid I, with a gravity becoming the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>God forbid! &s;aid he; with an emotion that plea&s;ed every-body&mdash;Not for <HI>your</HI> &s;ake, Harriet&mdash;Be not af|fectedly nice now; but for our own&mdash;</P>
<P>His face was in a glow&mdash;What, Lady L. what, Charlotte, &s;aid he, ails Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>She is not well, brother, replied I; but the mo&s;t charming &s;ick woman that ever lived. She is chear|ful, that &s;he may give no unea&s;ine&s;s to her friends. She joins in all their conver&s;ations, diver&s;ions, amu&s;e|ments. She would fain be well; and likes not to be thought ill. Were it not for her faded cheeks, her pale lips, and her changed complexion, we &s;hould not know from her&s;elf that &s;he ailed any-thing. Some people reach perfection &s;ooner than others; and are as &s;wift in their decay&mdash;Poor Mi&s;s Byron &s;eems not to be built for duration.</P>
<P>But &s;hould I write the&s;e things to you, my dear? Yet I know that Lady Clementina and You are &s;i&s;ters in magnanimity.</P>
<P>My brother was quite angry with me&mdash;Dear Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid he, explain this &s;peech of Charlotte. She loves to amu&s;e&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron is ble&s;&s;ed with a good con&s;titution: She is hardly yet in the perfection of her bloom. Set my heart at re&s;t. I love not either of my Si&s;ters, more than I do Mi&s;s Byron. Dear Char|lotte, I am really angry with you.</P>
<P>My good-natured Lord reddened up to his naked ears, at hearing my brother &s;ay he was angry with me. Sir Charles, &s;aid he, I am &s;orry you are &s;o &s;oon
<PB N="281" REF="282">
angry with your &s;i&s;ter. It is <HI>too</HI> true, Mi&s;s Byron is ill: She is, I fear in a declining way&mdash;</P>
<P>Pardon me, my dear Lord G.&mdash;Yet I am ready to be angry with any-body that &s;hall tell me, Mi&s;s By|ron is in a declining way&mdash;Dr. Bartlett&mdash;Pray&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, Mi&s;s Byron is not well&mdash;Lady G. has mingled her fears with her Love, in the de&s;cription. Mi&s;s Byron cannot but be lovely: Her complexion is &s;till fine. She is chearful, &s;erene, re&s;igned&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;igned,</HI> Dr. Bartlett!&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron is a &s;aint. She cannot but be re&s;igned, in the &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash;Re&s;ignation implies hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s. If &s;he is &s;o ill, would not you, my dear Dr. Bartlett, have in|formed me of it&mdash;Or was it from tenderne&s;s&mdash;<HI>You</HI> mu&s;t be kind in all you do.</P>
<P>I did not apprehend, &s;aid Lady L. that Mi&s;s Byron was &s;o very much indi&s;po&s;ed. Did you my Lord? (to Lord L.) Upon my word, Doctor, Si&s;ter, it was unkind, if &s;o, that you made me not acquainted&mdash;</P>
<P>And then her good-natured eye dropt a tear of Love for her Harriet.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry this went &s;o far. My brother was very unea&s;y. So was Mr. Beauchamp, for him, and for you, my dear.</P>
<P>That &s;he is, and endeavours to be, &s;o chearful, &s;aid Beauchamp, &s;hews, that nothing lies upon her mind&mdash;My father's illne&s;s only can more affect me, than Mi&s;s Byron's.</P>
<P>Emily wept for her Mi&s;s Byron. She has always been afraid, that her illne&s;s would be attended with ill con&s;equences.</P>
<P>My dear Love, my Harriet, you mu&s;t be well. See how <HI>every-body</HI> loves you. I told my brother, that I expected a Letter from Northampton&s;hire, by the next po&s;t; and I would inform him truly of the &s;tate of your health, from the contents of it.</P>
<P>I would not for the world have you think, my Harriet, that I meant to excite my brother's attention

I tell you, my dear, that, worthy as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is of a prince&s;s, he &s;hall not call you by his name, but with all his &s;oul.</P>
<P>As my brother laid it out to us this evening, I find we &s;hall lo&s;e him for &s;ome days. The game&s;ters whom Mr. Grandi&s;on permitted to ruin him, are at Winche&s;ter; dividing, I &s;uppo&s;e, and rejoicing over, their &s;poils of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on. Whether my brother intends to &s;ee them or not, I cannot tell. He expects not to do any-thing with them. They, no doubt, will &s;hew the fooli&s;h fellow, that <HI>they</HI> can keep what <HI>he</HI> could not: And Sir Charles aims only at practicable and legal, not at romantic, redre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Charles intends to pay his re&s;pects to Lord and La|dy W. at Wind&s;or; and to the Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude, who are at their Berk&s;hire &s;eat. My hone&s;t Lord has obtained my leave, at the fir&s;t a&s;king, to attend him thither.&mdash;My brother will wait on Sir Harry, and Lady Beauchamp, in his way to Lady Mansfield's&mdash;Beauchamp will accompany him thither.

as humble as a mou&s;e, tho' my brother does all he can to rai&s;e him, de&s;ires to be in his <HI>train,</HI> as he calls it, all the way, and never to be from under his wing. My brother intends to make a &s;hort vi&s;it to Grandi&s;on-hall, when he is &s;o near as at Lady Man&s;|field's: Dr. Bartlett will accompany him thither, as all the way; and hopes he will approve of every-thing he has done there, and in that neighbourhood, in his ab&s;ence. The good man has promi&s;ed to write to me. Emily is &s;ometimes to be with me, &s;ometimes with aunt Eleanor, at the Antient's reque&s;t; tho' Lord and Lady L. mutter at it. My brother's tru&s;ty Saunders is to be left behind, in order to di&s;patch to his ma&s;ter, by man and hor&s;e, any Letters that may come from abroad; and I have promi&s;ed to &s;end him an account of the healths, and-&s;o-forth, of our Northampton&s;hire friends. I think it would be a right thing in him to take a turn to Selby-hou&s;e. I hope you think &s;o too. Don't fib, Harriet.</P>

<P>I Will write to your Letter as it lies before me. I <HI>do</HI> mo&s;t heartily congratulate you, my dear La|dy G. on the arrival of your brother. I do not won|der that his fatigues, and his di&s;appointment, have made an alteration in his per&s;on and countenance. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on would not be the man he is, if he had not &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>You could not know your brother, my dear, if you expected from him recriminations on your pa&s;t odd
<PB N="284" REF="285">
behaviour to Lord G. I hope he does not yet know a tenth part of it: But if he did, as he hoped you &s;aw your error, and would be good for the future, he was right &s;urely to forget, what you ought not, but with contrition, to remember. You are very naughty in the Letter before me; and I love you too well to &s;pare you.</P>
<P>What can you mean, my dear, by exulting &s;o much over your aunt, for living, to an advanced age, a &s;in|gle woman? However ineffectual, let me add to my for|mer expo&s;tulatory chidings on this &s;ubject: Would you have one think you are overjoyed, that you have &s;o &s;oon put it out of any one's power to reproach you on the like account? If &s;o, you ought to be more thankful than you &s;eem to be, to Lord G. who has extended his genero&s;ity to you, and kept you from the odium. Upon my word, my dear Lady G. I think it looks like a want of decency in women, to ca&s;t re|flexions on others of their Sex, po&s;&s;ibly for their pru|dence and virtue. Do you con&s;ider, how you exalt, by your ludicrous freedoms, the men whom &s;ometimes you affect to de&s;pi&s;e? No wonder if <HI>they</HI> ridicule old maids. It is their intere&s;t to do &s;o. <HI>Lords of the Creation,</HI> &s;ometimes you deridingly call the in&s;ulters; Lords of the Creation, indeed you make them!&mdash;And pray, do you think, that the &s;ame weakne&s;s which made your aunt Grandi&s;on tell her dreams, in the joy of her heart, as an old maid, might not have made her guilty of the &s;ame foible, had &s;he been an old wife? Joy is the parent of many a &s;illy thing. Don't you own, that the arrival of your brother, which made your aunt break out into dream-telling, made you break into laughter (even in a Letter) of which you were a&s;hamed to tell the cau&s;e?&mdash;<HI>Wives,</HI> my dear, &s;hould not &s;all into the mi&s;takes, for which they would make <HI>maids</HI> the &s;ubject of their ridicule. You <HI>know</HI> better; and therefore &s;hould be above joining the fooli&s;h mul|titude, in a general cry to hunt down (as <HI>you</HI> reckon
<PB N="285" REF="286">
them) an <HI>unfortunate</HI> cla&s;s of people of your own Sex. Your aunt Grandi&s;on's dreams, let me add, were more innocent than your weaking mirth&mdash;You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> excu&s;e me&mdash;I could &s;ay a great deal more upon the &s;ubject; but if I have not &s;aid enough to make you &s;orry for your fault, a great deal more would be ineffectual&mdash;So much therefore for this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Poor dear Emily!&mdash;I wonder not at the effect the arrival, and fir&s;t &s;ight, of her guardian, had upon her tender heart.</P>
<P>But how wickedly do you treat your Lord!&mdash;Fie upon you, Charlotte!&mdash;And fie upon you again, for writing what I cannot, for your credit-&s;ake, read out to my friends. I wi&s;h, my dear, I could bring you to think, that there cannot be wit without ju&s;tice; nor humour without decorum: My Lord has &s;ome few foibles: But &s;hall a wife be the fir&s;t to di&s;cover them, and expo&s;e him for them? Cannot you cure him of them, without treating him with a ridicule which bor|ders upon contempt?&mdash;O my dear, you &s;hew us much greater foibles in your&s;elf, than my Lord ever yet had, when you make &s;o bad an u&s;e of talents that were given you for better purpo&s;es? One word only more on this &s;ubject&mdash;You cannot make me &s;mile, my dear, when you are thus un&s;ea&s;onable in your mirth. Henceforth, then, remember, that your <HI>excur&s;ivene&s;s</HI> (allow me the word, I had a har&s;her in my head) upon old maids, and your Lord, can only plea&s;e <HI>your|&s;elf;</HI> and <HI>I</HI> will not accept of your compliment. Why? Becau&s;e I will not be a partaker in your fault; as I &s;hould be, if I could countenance your levity.</P>
<P>Levity, Harriet!</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>levity,</HI> Charlotte&mdash;I will not &s;pare you. Whom do you &s;pare?</P>
<P>But do you really think me &s;o ill as you repre&s;ented me to be, to your brother? I don't think I am. If I did, I am &s;ure I &s;hould endeavour to put my thoughts in an ab&s;olutely new train: Nor would I quit the hold
<PB N="286" REF="287">
which at proper times, I do let go, to re-enter the world, as an individual, who imagines her&s;elf of &s;ome little u&s;e in it; and who is therefore obliged to per|form, with chearfulne&s;s, her allotted offices, however <HI>generally</HI> in&s;ignificant I may comparatively be.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you had no thoughts of exciting your brother's <HI>attention,</HI> by your &s;trong colouring, when you de&s;cribed the effects of my indi&s;po&s;ition to him. <HI>Attention!&mdash;Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> you might as well have &s;aid&mdash;I hope <HI>not.</HI> And I am obliged to Mr. Beauchamp for his inference, from the chearfulne&s;s, that nothing lay upon my mind. Now, tho' that inference &s;eemed to imply, that he thought, if he had not made the ob|&s;ervation, &s;omething <HI>might</HI> have been &s;uppo&s;ed to lie upon my mind, I am much better &s;atisfied that <HI>he</HI> made it, than if Sir Charles had.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I cannot but be plea&s;ed at two things in your Letter: The one, that Sir Charles ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;o great a concern for my health: The other, that you have all promi&s;ed, and that voluntarily, and from a &s;en&s;e of the fitne&s;s of the mea&s;ure, that every|thing be left to its natural cour&s;e&mdash;For my &s;ake, and for goodne&s;s-&s;ake, pray let it be &s;o. I think the open|ing, as you call it, was much, <HI>very</HI> much, too <HI>warm.</HI> Ble&s;s me, my dear, how I trembled as I read that part!&mdash;I am not, methinks, quite &s;atisfied with it, tho' I am with your intention.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my dear, Half a heart&mdash;A preferred La|dy!&mdash;For quality, fortune, and every merit, &s;o greatly preferable&mdash;O my Charlotte! I cannot, were the <HI>be&s;t</HI> to happen that can now happen, take &s;uch <HI>exceeding</HI> joy, as I once could have done, in the pro&s;pect of that <HI>be&s;t.</HI>&mdash;I have pride&mdash;But let us hear what the next Let|ters from Italy &s;ay; and it will be then time enough (if the truly admirable Lady &s;hall adhere to her re&s;olu|tion) to come with my &s;cruples and drawbacks. Your aunt Grandi&s;on is of opinion, that &s;he will <HI>not</HI> adhere. Who can tell what to &s;ay? Imagination, unnaturally
<PB N="287" REF="288">
heightened, may change into one altitude from an|other. I my&s;elf &s;incerely think (and have &s;o often &s;aid it, that an uncharitable mind would perhaps charge me with affectation for it) that Lady Clementina, and no other woman, can de&s;erve Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear. Pray tell your brother that I ne|ver thought my&s;elf &s;o ill as your friendly love made you apprehend me to be: And that I congratulate you with all my heart, and him al&s;o (it would be an affectation to forbear it, which would imply too much) on his &s;afe arrival in England. But be &s;ure remem|ber, that I look upon you and your Lord, upon my Lord and Lady L. and upon my &s;weet Emily, if &s;he &s;ees what I write, as guardians of the honour (of the <HI>punctilio,</HI> if you plea&s;e, &s;ince no <HI>di&s;</HI>-honour can be apprehended from Sir Charles Grandi&s;on) of</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XLV.</HI> Dr. <HI>BARTLETT,</HI> To Lady <HI>G.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, Sept. <HI>11.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your Lady&s;hip's commands, I write, but it mu&s;t be briefly, an account of our motions.</P>
<P>Sir Charles would not go out of town, till he had made a vi&s;it to Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, and enquired af|ter Mi&s;s Byron's health, of which he received an ac|count le&s;s alarming, than we, from our love and our fears, had given him.</P>
<P>We arrived at Wind&s;or on Wedne&s;day evening. My Lord and Lady W. expected him not till the next day.</P>
<P>I cannot find words to expre&s;s the joy with which they received him. My Lord acknowleged, before us all, that he owed it to God, and to him, that he was the happie&s;t man in the world. My Lady called her|&s;elf,
<PB N="288" REF="289">
with tears of joy, a happy woman: And Sir Charles told me, that when he was led by her to her clo&s;et, to talk about the affairs of her family, &s;he exceedingly aba&s;hed him, by expre&s;&s;ing her gratitude to him for his goodne&s;s to them all, on her knees; while he was almo&s;t ready, on <HI>his,</HI> he &s;aid, to acknow|lege the aunt, that had done &s;o much honour to his recommendation, and made his uncle &s;o happy.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, in order to have leave to depart next morning, as &s;oon as he had breakfa&s;ted, promi&s;ed to pa&s;s &s;everal days with them, when he could think him|&s;elf a <HI>&s;ettled Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>You, madam, and Lady L. equally love and ad|mire Lady W.: I will not, therefore, enlarge to you on her excellencies. Every-body loves her. Her &s;ervants, as they attend, look at their Lady, with the &s;ame delight, mingled with reverence, as tho&s;e of my patron look upon him.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Grandi&s;on could not help taking notice to me, with tears, on the joint acknowlegements of my Lord and Lady made to my patron, that goodne&s;s and beneficence brought with them their own rewards. Saw you not, my good Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid he, how my cou&s;in's eyes gli&s;tened with mode&s;t joy, as my Lord and Lady ran over with their gratitude? I thought of him, as an angel among men&mdash;What a wretch have I been! How can I &s;it at table with him! Yet how he overwhelms me with his goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>My patron having heard, that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen was at his hou&s;e on the fore&s;t, he rode to make him a vi&s;it, tho' &s;ome few miles out of his way. I attended him.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave is one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men. He is not yet fully recovered of the brui&s;es and rough treatment he met with near Paris: But he is &s;o mi&s;er|ably &s;unk in his &s;pirits, that my patron could not but be concerned for him. He received him with grateful acknowlegements, and was thankful for his vi&s;it:
<PB N="289" REF="290">
But he told him, that he was &s;o mi&s;erable in him&s;elf, that he could hardly thank him for &s;aving a life &s;o wretched.</P>
<P>Mr. Merceda, it &s;eems, died about a &s;ortnight ago.</P>
<P>That poor man was thought to be pretty well re|covered; and rode out &s;everal times: But was taken on his return from one of his rides, with a vomiting of blood; the con&s;equence, as imagined, of &s;ome in|ward brui&s;es; and died mi&s;erably. His death, and the manner of it, have greatly affected Sir Hargrave.&mdash;And poor Bagenhall, Sir Charles, &s;aid he, is as mi|&s;erable a dog as I am!</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, under&s;tanding, as he &s;aid, that I was a <HI>par&s;on,</HI> begged me to give him <HI>one prayer</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>He was &s;o importunate, and for Sir Charles to join in it, that we both kneeled with him.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave wept. He called him&s;elf a hardened dog.</P>
<P>Strange man!&mdash;But I think I was &s;till <HI>more</HI> af|fected (Sir Hargrave <HI>&s;hocked</HI> me!) by your noble brother's humanity, than by Sir Hargrave's wretch|edne&s;s; tears of compa&s;&s;ion for the poor man, &s;teal|ing down his manly cheek&mdash;God comfort you, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid he, wringing his hand&mdash;Dr. Bart|lett is a good man. You &s;hall have the prayers of us both.</P>
<P>He left him. He <HI>could</HI> &s;tay no longer; followed by the unhappy man's ble&s;&s;ings, interrupted by violent &s;obbings.</P>
<P>We were both &s;o moved, that we broke not &s;ilence, as we rode, till we joined our company at my Lord's.</P>
<P>I recounted what pa&s;&s;ed at this interview to Mr. Grandi&s;on. Your Lady&s;hip will not want me to be very particular in relating what were his applications
<PB N="290" REF="291">
to, and reflexions on, him&s;elf, when I tell you that he could not have been more concerned, had he been pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp was with us when I gave this re|lation to Mr. Grandi&s;on. He was affected at it, and with Mr. Grandi&s;on's &s;en&s;ibility: But how happy for him&s;elf was it, that his concern had in it no mixture of &s;elf reproach! It was a generous and humane con|cern, like that of his dear friend.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's next vi&s;it was to the good Earl of G. And here we left my Lord G.; the be&s;t natured, and one of the mo&s;t virtuous and prudent young noblemen in the Kingdom. Your Lady&s;hip will not accu&s;e me of flattery, when you read this; but you will, perhaps, of another view&mdash;Yet, as long as I know that you love to have ju&s;tice done to my Lord; and in your heart are &s;en&s;ible of the truth of what I &s;ay, and I am &s;ure rejoice in it; I give chearful way to the ju&s;tice; and the rather, as you look upon my Lord as &s;o much <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> that if you receive his prai&s;es with &s;ome little reluctance, it is with &s;uch a mode&s;t reluctance as you would receive your own; glad, at the &s;ame time, that you were &s;o ju&s;tly complimented.</P>
<P>My Lord will acquaint your Lady&s;hip with all that pa&s;&s;ed at the good Earl's; and how much overjoyed he and Lady Gertrude were at the favour they thought your brother did them in dining with them. His Lord|&s;hip will tell you al&s;o, how much they wi&s;h for you; for they propo&s;e to winter there, and not in Hertford|&s;hire, as once they thought to do.</P>
<P>Here Sir Charles enquired after their neighbour, Mr. Bagenhall.</P>
<P>He is become a very melancholy man. His wife is as obliging as he will let her be; but he hates her; and the le&s;s wonder, for he hates him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292">
Poor woman! &s;he could not expect a better fate. To yield up her cha&s;tity; to be forced upon him afterwards, by way of doing her poor ju&s;tice; what affiance can he have in her virtue, were &s;he to meet with a trial?</P>
<P>But that is not all; for though nobody que&s;tions her fidelity, yet what weight with him can her arguments have, were &s;he to endeavour to enforce upon his mind tho&s;e doctrines, which, were they to have proceeded from a pure heart, might, now-and-then, have let in a ray of light on his benighted &s;oul? A gloomy mind mu&s;t occa&s;ionally receive great con&s;olation from the interpo&s;al and &s;oothing of a companionable Love, when we know it comes from an untainted heart!</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Grandi&s;on found in <HI>this</HI> ca&s;e al&s;o great room for &s;elf-application and regret, without my being &s;o officious as to remind him of the &s;imilitude; tho' the woman who is endeavoured to be impo&s;ed on him for a wife, is a more guilty creature than ever Mrs. Bagenhall was.</P>
<P>And here, madam, allow me to ob&s;erve, that there is &s;uch a Samene&s;s in the lives, the actions, the pur|&s;uits of libertines, and &s;uch a likene&s;s in the accidents, puni&s;hments, and occa&s;ions for remor&s;e, which attend them, that I wonder they will not be warned by the beacons that are lighted up by every brother libertine whom they know; and that they will &s;o generally be driven on the &s;ame rock, over&s;pread and &s;urrounded as it is, in their very &s;ight, by a thou&s;and wrecks!&mdash;Did &s;uch know your brother, and learn from his example and hi&s;tory, what a <HI>variety</HI> there is in goodne&s;s, as he pa&s;&s;es on from object to object, exerci&s;ing, not officiou&s;ly, but as opportunity offers, his noble talents to the benefit of his fellow-creatures, &s;urely they would, like hone&s;t Mr. Sylve&s;ter, the attorney, endeavour to give them&s;elves &s;olid joy, by following what
<PB N="292" REF="293">
that gentleman ju&s;tly called &s;o <HI>&s;elf-rewarding</HI> an ex|ample.</P>
<P>Forgive me, madam, if &s;ometimes I am ready to preach: It is my province. Who but your brother can make every province his, and accommodate him|&s;elf to every &s;ubject?</P>
<P>We reached Sir Harry Beauchamp's that night; and there took up our lodgings.</P>
<P>Sir Harry &s;eems to be in a &s;wift decay; and he is very &s;en&s;ible of it. He rejoiced to &s;ee your brother. I was afraid, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, that our next meeting would have been in another world. May it be in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> world, and I &s;hall be happy!</P>
<P>This was a wi&s;h, a thought, not to be di&s;couraged in a dying man. Sir Charles was affected with it. You know, madam, that your brother has a heart the mo&s;t tender, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t in|trepid, of human hearts. I have learned much from him. He preaches by <HI>action.</HI> Till I knew him, young man as he then was, and &s;till is, my preaching was by <HI>words;</HI> I was contented, that my actions di&s;graced not my words.</P>
<P>Lady Beauchamp, as my patron afterwards told me, confe&s;&s;ed, in tears, that &s;he &s;hould owe to him all the tranquillity of mind that &s;he can hope for, if &s;he &s;urvive Sir Harry. O Sir, &s;aid &s;he, till I knew you, I was a narrow &s;elfi&s;h creature. I was jealous of a father's Love to a worthy &s;on; who&s;e worthine&s;s I knew not, as a &s;on, and as a friend: That was the happie&s;t day of our Beauchamp's life, which introduced him to an intimacy with you.</P>
<P>Here, on Friday morning, we left Mr. Beauchamp, &s;orrowing for his father's illne&s;s, and endeavouring, by every tender act of duty, to comfort his mother|in-law on a deprivation, with which, I am afraid, &s;he will &s;oon be tried.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">
My Beauchamp loves you, Sir Charles, &s;aid Sir Harry, at parting in the morning after breakfa&s;t; and &s;o he <HI>ought.</HI> Where-ever you are, he wants to be; but &s;pare him to his mother and me for a few days: He is her comforter, and mine. Fain, very fain, would I have longer rejoiced, if God had &s;een fit, in the Love of both. But I re&s;ign to the Divine Will. Pray for me: You al&s;o, Dr. Bartlett, pray for me. My &s;on tells me what a good man you are&mdash;And may we meet in heaven! I am afraid, Sir Charles, that I never &s;hall &s;ee you again in this world&mdash;But why &s;hould I oppre&s;s your noble heart? God be your Guide and Protector! Take care of your precious health. You have a great deal to do, before you fini&s;h your glorious cour&s;e, and come to this la&s;t period of human vanity.</P>
<P>My patron was both grieved and rejoiced&mdash;Rejoiced to &s;ee Sir Harry in a frame of mind &s;o different from that to which he had been a witne&s;s in Sir Hargrave Pollex&s;en; and grieved to find him pa&s;t all hopes of recovery.</P>
<P>Sir Charles pur&s;ued his journey, cro&s;s the country, to Lady Mansfield's. We found no convenient place for dining, and arrived at Mansfield-hou&s;e about five on Friday afternoon.</P>
<P>My Lady Mansfield, her daughter and &s;ons, were overjoyed to &s;ee my patron. Mr. Grandi&s;on told me, that he never, from infancy to this time, &s;hed &s;o many tears as he has &s;hed on this &s;hort tour, &s;ometimes from joy, &s;ometimes from grief. I don't know, madam, whether one &s;hould wi&s;h him re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his for|tune, if it could be done; &s;ince calamity, rightly &s;up|ported, is a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Here I left my patron, and proceeded on Saturday morning with Mr. Grandi&s;on to the Hall. If Sir Charles finds matters ripened for a treaty between the Mans|fields
<PB N="294" REF="295">
and their adver&s;aries, as he has been put in hopes, he will go near to &s;tay at Mansfield-hou&s;e, and only vi&s;it us at the Hall incognito, to avoid neighbourly con|gratulations, till he can bring things to bear.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on ju&s;t now told me, that Sir Charles, before he left town, gave him a 400 <HI>l.</HI> bank note, to enable him to pay off his debts to trade&s;men; of which, at his de&s;ire, he had given him in a li&s;t; amounting to 360 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>He owes, he &s;ays, 100 <HI>l.</HI> more to the widow of a wine-merchant; but being re&s;olved to pay it the mo|ment money comes into his hands, he would not ac|quaint Sir Charles with it.</P>
