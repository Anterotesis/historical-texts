<HEAD>TO His Royal Highne&s;s WILLIAM, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Royal Highne&s;s,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I pre&s;umed to &s;olicit the honour of laying the &s;ub&s;equent trifle at your Royal Highne&s;s's feet; it was not without a thorough con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the little value of the offering I was going to make; but I con&s;idered, mean as it was, it would &s;erve as a te&s;ti|mony of my devotion; and to a Prince happy in a love of the arts, nothing could be unacceptable, which bore the remote&s;t analogy to them.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">How far the Comic Opera, under proper regulations, has a right to be acknowledg|ed for a junior offspring of the Drama, and as &s;uch become candidate for a &s;hare of public encouragement, I &s;hall not pre|tend to determine; but if it can be ren|dered an agreeable amu&s;ement, the Engli&s;h Theatre has never &s;crupled to adopt, what was capable of plea&s;ing there; and though as a work of genius, it is by no means to be &s;et in competition with good Tragedies and Comedies, it may, I apprehend, be permitted as an occa&s;ional relief to them, without bringing either our ta&s;te or un|der&s;tanding into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I need not inform your Royal Highne&s;s, that in France, where the &s;tage has been cultivated with more care, and &s;ucce&s;s, than in any other country; this &s;pecies of entertainment is received with very great applau&s;e; nor is it thought any injury to Corneille, and Moliere, that the pieces of An&s;eaume and Favart, meet with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">It is true, among the French, Comic Operas have very often the advantage of being extremely well written; of which, On ne S'avi&s;e jamais de tout, Le Roy, et le Fermier, and &s;ome others are an in|&s;tance; nor would the be&s;t compo&s;ition of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter, make a very con|temptible poem pa&s;s on an audience: I wi&s;h I could a&s;&s;ert with truth, that in this re&s;pect, we fall nothing behind our neigh|bours, and that what I here pre&s;ent to your Royal Highne&s;s, might lay claim to &s;ome degree of merit, even in the writ|ing: but though I cannot do this, permit me to &s;ay, I have attempted to render it a little intere&s;ting, and not wholly undivert|ing, as far as the mu&s;ic, my principal care, would give me leave.</P>
<P>But I humbly beg your Royal High|ne&s;s's pardon; in applying to the con|noi&s;&s;eur, I forget that I am at the &s;ame time addre&s;&s;ing a Great Prince: indeed, there is a &s;ubject, on which I could dwell with the true&s;t plea&s;ure; but I
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
am too well in&s;tructed in your Royal Highne&s;s's character, to dare to offend you, with a language, which forms and cu&s;tom, too often impo&s;e upon princes, a nece&s;&s;ity of hearing; I mean their own prai&s;e; to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t de&s;erving, ever lea&s;t welcome.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I, therefore, &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, With the profounde&s;t re&s;pect, May it plea&s;e your Royal Highne&s;s, Your Royal Highne&s;s's, Mo&s;t obedient, Mo&s;t devoted, and Mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;carce a language in Europe, in which there is not a play taken from our romance of Pamela; in Italian and French, particularly, &s;everal writers of the fir&s;t eminence, have cho&s;en it for the &s;ubject of different dramas.</P>
<P>The little piece now ventured into the world, owes its origin to the &s;ame &s;ource, not only the general &s;ubject is drawn from Pamela, but almo&s;t every circum&s;tance in it. The reader will immediately recollect &mdash;the court&s;hip of Par&s;on Williams&mdash;the Squire's jealou&s;y and behaviour in con&s;e|quence of it, and the difficulty he had to prevail with him&s;elf to marry the girl, notwith&s;tanding his pa&s;&s;ion for her&mdash;the miller is a clo&s;e copy of Goodman An|drews
<PB N="ii" REF="7">
&mdash;Ralph is imagined, from the wild &s;on which he is mentioned to have had&mdash; Theodo&s;ia, from the young lady of quality, with whom Mr. B. through his &s;i&s;ter's per&s;ua&s;ion, is &s;aid to have been in treaty before his marriage with Pamela&mdash;even the gip&s;ies, are borrowed from a trifling incident in the latter part of the work.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this plan, which he has varied from the original, as far as he thought convenient, the author has made &s;implicity his principal aim. His &s;cenes, on account of the mu&s;ic, which could not be perfect without &s;uch a mixture, nece&s;|&s;arily con&s;i&s;t of &s;erious and buffoon. He knows gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and in&s;ipidity lay in his way; whether he has had art enough to avoid &s;tumbling upon them, the candid Public is left to determine.</P>

<P>Well Patty, Ma&s;ter Goodman my lord's &s;teward has been with me ju&s;t now, and I find we are like to have great doings, his lord&s;hip has brought down &s;ir Harry Sycamore, and his family; and there is more company expected in a few days.</P>

<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know &s;ir Harry very well, he is by marriage a di&s;tant relation of my lord's.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what &s;ort of a young body is the daugh|ter there? I think &s;he us'd to be with you at the ca&s;tle, three or four &s;ummers ago, when my young lord was out upon his travels.</P>

<P>Oh very often, &s;he was a great favourite of my lady's; pray father is &s;he come down?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know the report la&s;t night, about my lord's going to be married; by what I can learn &s;he is, and there is likely to be a nearer relation&s;hip be|tween
<PB N="5" REF="14">
the families, e're long. It &s;eems, his lord&s;hip was not over willing for the match, but the friends on both &s;ides in London pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o hard: then there's a &s;winging fortune, ma&s;ter Goodman tells me, a matter of twenty or thirty thou&s;and pounds!</P>

<P>This worthy baronet, and his lady, are certainly a very whim&s;ical couple, however, their daughter is perfectly amiable in every re&s;pect; and yet I am &s;orry I have brought her down here; for can I in honour marry her, while my affections are engaged to ano|ther? To what does the pride of condition and the cen|&s;ure of the world force me! Mu&s;t I then renounce the only per&s;on that can make me happy; becau&s;e, be|cau&s;e what? becau&s;e &s;he's a miller's daughter. Vain pride and unju&s;t cen&s;ure: has &s;he not all the graces that education can give her &s;ex, improved by a genius &s;eldom found among the highe&s;t? Has &s;he not mode&s;ty, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and beauty of per&s;on, capable of adorning a rank the mo&s;t exalted? But it is too late to think of the&s;e things now; my hand is promi&s;ed, my honour engaged; and if it was not &s;o, &s;he has engaged her&s;elf, the farmer is a per&s;on to her mind, and I have authori&s;ed their union by my approbation.</P>

<P>And why &s;o my lord?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith Ma'am, becau&s;e I can't live happy without her &mdash;And I think &s;he has too many amiable, too many e&s;timable qualities to meet with a wor&s;e fate.</P>

<P>Well, but you are a peer of the realm, you will have all the fleerers&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know very well the ridicule that may be thrown on a lord's marrying a miller's daughter; and I own with blu&s;hes, it has for &s;ome time had too great weight with me; but we &s;hould marry to plea&s;e our|&s;elves, not other people: and on mature con&s;ideration, I can &s;ee no reproach ju&s;tly merited, by rai&s;ing a de&s;erv|ing woman to a &s;tation &s;he is capable of adorning, let her birth be what it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why 'tis very true my lord: I once knew a gentleman that married his cook maid; he was a relation of my own&mdash;you remember fat Margery, my lady! She was a very good &s;ort of a woman, in|deed &s;he was, and made the be&s;t &s;uet dumplings that ever I ta&s;ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Syc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you never learn, Sir Harry, to guard your expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;Well, but give me leave my lord to &s;ay a word to you&mdash;there are other ill con&s;equences attending &s;uch an alliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of them I &s;uppo&s;e is, that I, a peer, &s;hould be obliged to call this good old miller, father-in-law; but where's the &s;hame in that? he is as good as any lord, in being a man; and if we dare &s;uppo&s;e a lord that is not an hone&s;t man, he is, in my opinion, the more re&s;pectable character. Come ma&s;ter Fairfield, give me your hand, from henceforth you have done with working; we will pull down your mill, and build you a hou&s;e in the place of it; and the money I in|tended for the portion of your daughter, &s;hall now be laid out in purcha&s;ing a commi&s;&s;ion for your &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my lord, will you make me a cap|tain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Aim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, a colonel, if you de&s;erve it.</P>
