<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following memoir is nei|ther calculated to enflame the reader's pa&s;&s;ions with de&s;criptions of gallantry, nor to gratify his malevo|lence with details of &s;candal. The amours of coxcombs, and the pur|&s;uits of debauchees, are as de&s;titute of novelty to attract us as they are of va|riety to entertain, they &s;till pre&s;ent us but the &s;ame picture, a picture we have &s;een a thou&s;and times repeated. The life of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> is incapable of &s;up|plying any entertainment of this na|ture to a prurient curio&s;ity. Tho' it was pa&s;t in the very mid&s;t of de|bauchery, he practi&s;ed but few of tho&s;e vices he was often obliged to
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
a&s;&s;ent to. Tho' he lived where gal|lantry was the capital pur&s;uit, he was never known to favour it by his ex|ample, and what authority he had was &s;et to oppo&s;e it. In&s;tead therefore of a romantic hi&s;tory filled with warm pictures and fanciful adventures, the reader of the following account mu&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfied with a genuine and can|did recital compiled from the papers he left behind, and others equally au|thentic; a recital neither written with a &s;pirit of &s;atire nor panegyric, and with &s;carce any other art, than that of arranging the materials in their natural order.</P>
<P>But tho' little art has been u&s;ed, it is hoped that &s;ome entertainment may be collected from the life of a per&s;on &s;o much talked of, and yet &s;o little
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
known as Mr. <HI>Na&s;h.</HI> The hi&s;tory of a man, who for more than fifty years pre&s;ided over the plea&s;ures of a polite kingdom, and who&s;e life, tho' without any thing to &s;urpri&s;e, was ever marked with &s;ingularity, de|&s;erves the attention of the pre&s;ent age; the pains he took in pur|&s;uing plea&s;ure, and the &s;olemnity he a&s;&s;umed in adju&s;ting trifles, may one day claim the &s;mile of po&s;terity. At lea&s;t &s;uch an hi&s;tory is well e|nough calculated to &s;upply a vacant hour with innocent amu&s;ement, how|ever it may fail to open the heart, or improve the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Yet his life, how trifling &s;oever it may appear to the inattentive, was not without its real advantages to the public. He was the fir&s;t who dif|fu&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;ociety, and an ea&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
of addre&s;s among a whole peo|ple who were formerly cen&s;ured by foreigners for a re&s;ervedne&s;s of beha|viour, and an aukward timidity in their fir&s;t approaches. He fir&s;t taught a familiar intercour&s;e among &s;trangers at <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among them. That ea&s;e and open accce&s;s fir&s;t ac|quired there, our gentry brought back to the metropolis, and thus the whole kingdom by degrees became more refined by le&s;&s;ons originally de|rived from him.</P>
<P>Had it been my de&s;ign to have made this hi&s;tory more plea&s;ing at the expence of truth, it had been ea&s;ily performed, but I cho&s;e to de|&s;cribe the man as he was, not &s;uch as imagination could have helped
<PB N="v" REF="7">
in compleating his picture; he will be found to be a weak man, governing weaker &s;ubjects, and may be con&s;idered as re&s;embling a mo|narch of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> whom <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;omewhere calls, <HI>the little king of a little people.</HI></P>
<P>But while I have been careful in de&s;cribing the monarch, his domini|ons have claimed no &s;mall &s;hare of my attention; I have given an exact account of the ri&s;e, regulation, and nature of the amu&s;ements of the city of <HI>Bath,</HI> how far Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> contribu|ted to e&s;tabli&s;h and refine them, and what plea&s;ure a &s;tranger may expect there upon his arrival. Such anec|dotes as are at once true and worth pre&s;erving are produced in their or|der, and &s;ome &s;tories are added,
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
which, tho' commonly known, more nece&s;&s;arily belong to this hi&s;tory, than to the places from whence they have been extracted. But it is needle&s;s to point out the pains that have been taken, or the entertainment that may be expected from the peru&s;al of this performance. It is but an indiffer|ent way to gain the reader's e&s;teem, to be my own panegyri&s;t, nor is this preface &s;o much de&s;igned to lead him to beauties, as to demand par|don for defects.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF RICHARD NASH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>_HISTORY owes its excellence more to the writer's manner than the materials of which it is compo&s;ed. The intrigues of courts, or the deva&s;tation of armies are re|garded by the remote &s;pectator with as little attention as the &s;quabbles of a village, or the fate of a malefactor, that fall under his own ob&s;ervation. The great and the little, as they have the &s;ame &s;en&s;es, and
<PB N="2" REF="10">
the &s;ame affections, generally pre&s;ent the &s;ame picture to the hand of the draught&s;|man; and whether the heroe or the clown be the &s;ubject of the memoir, it is only man that appears with all his native mi|nutene&s;s about him, for nothing very great was ever yet formed from the little ma|terials of humanity.</P>
<P>Thus none can properly be &s;aid to write hi&s;tory, but he who under&s;tands the hu|man heart, and its whole train of affec|tions and follies. Tho&s;e affections and follies are properly the materials he has to work upon. The relations of great events may &s;urprize indeed; they may be cal|culated to in&s;truct tho&s;e very few, who govern the million beneath, but the ge|nerality of mankind find the mo&s;t real improvement from relations which are levelled to the general &s;urface of life; which tell, not how men learned to con|quer, but how they endeavoured to live; not how they gained the &s;hout of the admiring croud, but how they acquired
<PB N="3" REF="11">
the e&s;teem of their friends and acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>Every man's own life would perhaps furni&s;h the mo&s;t plea&s;ing materials for hi&s;tory, if he only had candour enough to be &s;incere, and &s;kill enough to &s;elect &s;uch parts as once making him more prudent, might &s;erve to render his readers more cautious. There are few who do not prefer a page of <HI>Montaigne</HI> or <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> who candidly tells us what they thought of the world, and the world thought of them, to the more &s;tately memoirs and tran&s;|actions of <HI>Europe,</HI> where we &s;ee Kings pretending to immortality, that are now almo&s;t forgotten, and &s;tate&s;men planning frivolous negociations, that &s;carce outlive the &s;igning.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that mini&s;ters and Kings were left to write their own hi&s;to|ries; they are truly u&s;eful to few but them|&s;elves; but for men who are contented with more humble &s;tations, I fancy &s;uch truths only are &s;erviceable as may conduct
<PB N="4" REF="12">
them &s;afely through life. That know|ledge which we can turn to our real benefit &s;hould be mo&s;t eagerly pur&s;ued. Trea&s;ures which we cannot u&s;e but little encrea&s;e the happine&s;s or even the pride of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s to write the hi&s;tory of a man placed in the middle ranks of life; of one, who&s;e vices and virtues were open to the eye of the mo&s;t undi&s;cerning &s;pectator, who was placed in public view without power to repre&s;s cen&s;ure, or command adulation, who had too much merit not to become remarkable, yet too much folly to arrive at greatne&s;s. I attempt the character of one, who was ju&s;t &s;uch a man as probably you or I may be, but with this difference, that he never performed an action which the world did not know, or ever formed a wi&s;h which he did not take pains to divulge. In &s;hort I have cho&s;en to write the life of the noted Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> as it will be the delineation of a mind without di&s;gui&s;e, of a man ever a&s;&s;iduous without indu&s;try, and plea&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="13">
to his &s;uperiors without any &s;uperiority of genius or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Yet if there be any who think the &s;ub|ject of too little importance to command attention, and had rather gaze at the ac|tions of the great, than be directed in guiding their own, I have one undeniable claim to their attention. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was him&s;elf a King. In this particular, per|haps no Biographer has been &s;o happy as I. They who are for a delineation of men and manners may find &s;ome &s;atisfac|tion that way, and tho&s;e who delight in adventures of Kings and Queens, may perhaps find their hopes &s;atisfied in ano|ther.</P>
<P>It is a matter of very little importance who were the parents, or what was the edu|cation of a man who owed &s;o little of his advancement to either. He &s;eldom boa&s;ted of family or learning, and his father's name and circum&s;tances were &s;o little known, that Doctor <HI>Cheyne</HI> u&s;ed frequently to affirm that <HI>Na&s;h</HI> had no father. The
<PB N="6" REF="14">
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI> one day rallying him in public company upon the ob&s;cu|rity of his birth, compared him to <HI>Gil-Blas,</HI> who was a&s;hamed of his father: No, Madam, replied <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> I &s;eldom mention my father in company, not becau&s;e I have any rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of him; but becau&s;e he has &s;ome rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of me.</P>
<P>However, though &s;uch anecdotes be immaterial, to go on in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of hi&s;tory, it may be proper to ob&s;erve that <HI>Richard Na&s;h</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; the &s;ubject of this memoir, was born in the town of <HI>Swan-&s;ea,</HI> in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> on the 18th of <HI>October,</HI> in the year 1674. His father was a gentleman, who&s;e principal income aro&s;e from a partner&s;hip in a gla&s;s-hou&s;e; his mother was niece to Colonel <HI>Poyer,</HI> who was killed by <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> for defending <HI>Pembroke</HI> ca&s;tle again&s;t the re|bels. He was educated under Mr. <HI>Mad|docks</HI> at <HI>Carmarthan</HI> &s;chool, and from thence &s;ent to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> college, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> in order to prepare him for the &s;tudy
<PB N="7" REF="15">
of the law. His father had &s;trained his little income to give his &s;on &s;uch an education, but from the boy's natural vivacity, he hoped a recompence from his future preferment. In college, how|ever, he &s;oon &s;hewed that though much might be expected from his genius, no|thing could be hoped from his indu&s;try. A mind &s;trongly turned to plea&s;ure, al|ways is fir&s;t &s;een at the univer&s;ity, there the youth fir&s;t finds him&s;elf freed from the re&s;traint of tutors, and being treated by his friends in &s;ome mea&s;ure as a man, a&s;&s;umes the pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires of riper age, and di&s;covers in the boy, what are likely to be the affections of his matu|rity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t method Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> took to di&s;|tingui&s;h him&s;elf at college was not by ap|plication to &s;tudy, but by his a&s;&s;iduity in intrigue. In the neighbourhood of every univer&s;ity there are girls who with &s;ome beauty, &s;ome coquettry, and little fortune, lie upon the watch for every raw amorous youth, more inclined to make love than
<PB N="8" REF="16">
to &s;tudy. Our Heroe was quickly caught, and went through all the mazes and ad|ventures of a college intrigue, before he was &s;eventeen; he offered marriage, the offer was accepted, but the whole affair com|ing to the knowledge of his tutors, his happine&s;s, or perhaps his future mi&s;ery, was prevented, and he was &s;ent home from college, with nece&s;&s;ary advice to him, and proper in&s;tructions to his father.</P>
<P>When a man knows his power over the fair &s;ex, he generally commences their admirer for the re&s;t of life. That tri|umph which he obtains over one, only makes him the &s;lave of another, and thus he proceeds conquering and conquered, to the clo&s;ing of the &s;cene. The army &s;eemed the mo&s;t likely profe&s;&s;ion in which to di&s;play this inclination for gallantry; he therefore purcha&s;ed a pair of colours, commenced a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of the &s;ex, and dre&s;&s;ed to the very edge of his finances. But the life of a &s;oldier is more plea&s;ing to the &s;pectator at a di&s;tance than to the per&s;on who makes the experiment.
<PB N="9" REF="17">
Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;oon found that a red coat alone would never &s;ucceed, that the company of the fair &s;ex is not to be procured without expence, and that his &s;canty commi&s;&s;ion could never procure him the proper re|imbur&s;ements. He found too that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms required attendance and duty, and often encroached upon tho&s;e hours he could have wi&s;hed to dedicate to &s;ofter purpo&s;es. In &s;hort, he &s;oon be|came di&s;gu&s;ted with the life of a &s;oldier, quitted the army, entered his name as a &s;tudent in the temple books, and here went to the very &s;ummit of &s;econd-rate luxury. Though very poor he was very fine; he &s;pread the little gold he had, in the mo&s;t o&s;tentatious manner, and though the gild|ing was but thin, he laid it on as far as it would go. They who know the town, cannot be unacquainted with &s;uch a cha|racter as I de&s;cribe; one, who though he may have dined in private upon a banquet &s;erved cold from a cook's &s;hop, &s;hall dre&s;s at &s;ix for the &s;ide box; one of tho&s;e, who&s;e wants are only known to their laundre&s;s, and trade&s;men, and their fine
<PB N="10" REF="18">
cloaths to half the nobility; who &s;pend more in chair hire, than hou&s;ekeeping; and prefer a bow from a Lord, to a din|ner from a Commoner.</P>
<P>In this manner Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;pent &s;ome years about town, till at la&s;t his genteel appearance, his con&s;tant civility, and &s;till more, his a&s;&s;iduity, gained him the ac|quaintance of &s;everal per&s;ons qualified to lead the fa&s;hion both by birth and fortune. To gain the friend&s;hip of the young no|bility little more is requi&s;ite than much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and very fine cloaths; dre&s;s has a mechanical influence upon the mind, and we naturally are awed into re&s;pect and e&s;teem at the elegance of tho&s;e, whom even our rea&s;on would teach us to contemn. He &s;eemed early &s;en&s;ible of human weak|ne&s;s in this re&s;pect, he brought a per&s;on genteely dre&s;&s;ed to every a&s;&s;embly, he always made one of tho&s;e who are called very good company, and a&s;&s;urance gave him an air of elegance and ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="19">When King <HI>William</HI> was upon the throne, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was a member of the <HI>Middle Temple.</HI> It had been long cu&s;tomary for the Inns of court to entertain our Monarchs upon their acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, or &s;ome &s;uch remarkable occa&s;ion, with a revel and pageant. In the earlier periods of our hi&s;tory, Poets were the conductors of the&s;e entertainments; plays were exhibited, and complimentary ver&s;es were then written; but by degrees the pageant alone was con|tinued, Sir <HI>John Davis</HI> being the la&s;t poet that wrote ver&s;es upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion in the reign of <HI>James</HI> I.</P>
<P>This ceremony which has been at length totally di&s;continued, was la&s;t exhibited in honour of King <HI>William,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was cho&s;en to conduct the whole with proper decorum. He was then but a very young man, but we &s;ee at how early an age he was thought proper to guide the amu&s;ements of his country, and be the <HI>Arbiter Elegantiarum</HI> of his time; we &s;ee how early he gave proofs of that &s;pirit of regularity, for which he afterwards became
<PB N="12" REF="20">
famous, and &s;hewed an attention to tho&s;e little circum&s;tances, of which tho' the ob|&s;ervance be trifling, the neglect has often interrupted men of the greate&s;t abilities in the progre&s;s of their fortunes.</P>
<P>In conducting this entertainment, <HI>Na&s;h</HI> had an opportunity of exhibiting all his abilities, and King <HI>William</HI> was &s;o well &s;atisfied with his performance, that he made him an offer of knighthood. This, however, he thought proper to refu&s;e, which in a per&s;on of his di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems &s;trange. <HI>Plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</HI> replied he, when the offer was made him, <HI>if you intend to make me a Knight, I wi&s;h it may be one of your poor Knights of</HI> Wind&s;or, <HI>and then I &s;hall have a fortune, at lea&s;t able to &s;upport my title.</HI> Yet we do not find, that the King took the hint of encrea&s;ing his fortune, perhaps he could not, he had at that time numbers to oblige, and he never cared to give money without important &s;ervices.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21">But though <HI>Na&s;h</HI> acquired no riches by his late office, yet he gained many friends, or what is more ea&s;ily obtained, many acquaintance, who often an&s;wer the end as well. In the populous city where he re&s;ided, to be known was almo&s;t &s;ynoni|mous with being in the road to fortune. How many little Things do we &s;ee, with|out merit, or without friends, pu&s;h them|&s;elves forward into public notice, and by &s;elf-advertizing, attract the attention of the day. The wi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e them, but the public are not all wi&s;e. Thus they &s;ucceed, ri&s;e upon the wing of folly, or of fa&s;hion, and by their &s;ucce&s;s give a new &s;anction to effrontery.</P>
<P>But be&s;ide his a&s;&s;urance, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> had in reality &s;ome merit and &s;ome virtues. He was, if not a brilliant, at lea&s;t an ea&s;y companion. He never forgot good man|ners, even in the highe&s;t warmth of fa|miliarity, and as I hinted before, never went in a dirty &s;hirt to di&s;grace the table of his patron or his friend. The&s;e qua|lifications might make the furniture of his
<PB N="14" REF="22">
head; but for his heart, that &s;eemed an a&s;&s;emblage of the virtues which di&s;play an hone&s;t benevolent mind; with the vices which &s;pring from too much good nature. He had pity for every creature's di&s;tre&s;s, but wanted prudence in the application of his benefits. He had genero&s;ity for the wretched in the highe&s;t degree, at a time when his creditors complained of his ju&s;|tice. He often &s;poke fal&s;hoods, but never had any of his harmle&s;s tales tinctured with malice.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of his humanity is told us in the Spectator, though his name is not mentioned. When he was to give in his accompts to the ma&s;ters of the tem|ple, among other articles, he charged <HI>For making one man happy</HI> 10<HI>l.</HI> Being que&s;tioned about the meaning of &s;o &s;trange an item, he frankly declared, that hap|pening to over-hear a poor man declare to his wife and a large family of children, that 10<HI>l.</HI> would make him happy, he could not avoid trying the experiment. He added, that if they did not chu&s;e to
<PB N="15" REF="23">
acquie&s;ce in his charge, he was ready to refund the money. The ma&s;ters &s;truck with &s;uch an uncommon in&s;tance of good nature, publicly thanked him for his be|nevolence, and de&s;ired that the &s;um might be doubled as a proof of their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of his unaccountable genero&s;ity, and I &s;hall proceed. In &s;ome tran&s;actions with one of his friends, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was brought in debtor twenty pounds. His friend frequently a&s;ked for the money, and was as often denied. He found at la&s;t, that a&s;&s;iduity was likely to have no effect, and therefore contrived an ho|nourable method of getting back his mo|ney without di&s;&s;olving the friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. One day, re|turning from <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s chamber with the u&s;ual a&s;&s;urance of being paid to morrow, he went to one of their mutual acquaint|ance, and related the frequent di&s;appoint|ments he had received, and the little hopes he had of being ever paid.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My de&s;ign, continues he, is that you &s;hould go, and try to borrow twenty pounds from <HI>Na&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="24">
and bring me the money. I am apt to think, he will lend to you, tho' he will not pay me. Perhaps we may extort from his genero&s;ity, what I have failed to receive from his ju&s;tice."</Q>
His friend obeys, and going to Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, that, unle&s;s relieved by his friend&s;hip, he &s;hould certainly be undone; he wanted to borrow twenty pounds; and had tried all his acquaintance without &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> who had but &s;ome minutes before, refu&s;ed to pay a ju&s;t debt, was in raptures at thus giving an in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip, and in&s;tantly lent what was required. Im|mediately upon the receipt, the pretended borrower goes to the real creditor, and gives him the money, who met Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> the day after: our heroe upon &s;eeing him, immediately began his u&s;ual excu&s;es, that the billiard room had &s;tript him, that he was never &s;o damnably out of ca&s;h, but that in a few days&mdash;My dear Sir, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s, replied the other, I would not interrupt your tranquillity for the world, you lent twenty pounds ye&s;ter|day to our friend of the back &s;tairs, and
<PB N="17" REF="25">
he lent it to me, give him your receipt, and you &s;hall have mine.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perdition &s;eize <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, cried <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> thou ha&s;t been too many for me. You demanded a debt, he a&s;ked a favour; to pay thee, would not encrea&s;e our friend&s;hip, but to lend him, was procuring a new friend, by conferring a new obligation.</Q></P>
<P>Whether men at the time I am now talking of, had more wit than at pre&s;ent, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is, they took more pains to &s;hew what they had. In that age, a fel|low of high humour would drink no wine, but what was &s;trained through his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es &s;mock. He would eat a pair of her &s;hoes to&s;&s;ed up in a frica&s;ee. He would &s;wallow tallow-candles in&s;tead of toa&s;ted chee&s;e, and even run naked about town, as it was then &s;aid, to divert the ladies. In &s;hort, that was the age of &s;uch kind of wit as is the mo&s;t di&s;tant of all others from wi&s;dom.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was now fairly for life en|tered into a new cour&s;e of gaiety and di&s;&s;i|pation, and &s;teady in nothing but in pur|&s;uit of variety. He was thirty years old, without fortune, or u&s;eful talents to ac|quire one. He had hitherto only led a life of expedients, he thanked chance alone for his &s;upport, and having been long precariou&s;ly &s;upported, he became, at length, totally a &s;tranger to prudence, or precaution. Not to di&s;gui&s;e any part of his character, he was now, by profe&s;&s;ion, a game&s;ter, and went on from day to day, feeling the vici&s;&s;itudes of rapture and an|gui&s;h, in proportion to the fluctuations of fortune.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>London</HI> was the only the|atre in <HI>England,</HI> for plea&s;ure, or intrigue.
<PB N="21" REF="29">
A &s;pirit of gaming, had been introduced in the licentious age of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and had by this time thriven &s;urprizingly. Yet all its deva&s;tations were confined to <HI>London</HI> alone. To this great mart of every folly, &s;harpers from every country daily arrived, for the winter, but were obliged to leave the kingdom at the approach of &s;ummer, in order to open a new cam|paign at <HI>Aix, Spaw,</HI> or the <HI>Hague. Bath, Tunbridge, Scarborough,</HI> and other places of the &s;ame kind here, were then fre|quented only by &s;uch as really went for relief; the plea&s;ures they afforded were merely rural, the company &s;plenetic, ru&s;|tic, and vulgar. In this &s;ituation of things, people of fa&s;hion had no agreeable &s;um|mer retreat from the town, and u&s;ually &s;pent that &s;ea&s;on amid&s;t a &s;olitude of coun|try &s;quires, par&s;ons wives, and vi&s;iting te|nants, or farmers; they wanted &s;ome place where they might have each others com|pany, and win each others money, as they had done during the winter in town.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30">To a per&s;on, who does not thus calmly trace things to their &s;ource, nothing will appear more &s;trange, than how the healthy could ever con&s;ent to follow the &s;ick to tho&s;e places of &s;pleen, and live with tho&s;e, who&s;e di&s;orders are ever apt to excite a gloom in the &s;pectator. The truth is, the gaming table was properly the &s;alutary font, to which &s;uch numbers flocked. Gaming will ever be the plea&s;ure of the rich, while men continue to be men, while they fancy more happine&s;s in being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what they want, than they experience plea&s;ure in the fruition of what they have. The wealthy only &s;take tho&s;e riches, which give no real content, for an expectation of riches, in which they hope for &s;atisfaction. By this calculation, they cannot lo&s;e happine&s;s, as they begin with none; and they hope to gain it, by being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;omething they have not had already.</P>
<P>Probably upon this principle; and by the arrival of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> there for her health, About the year 1703, the city of
<PB N="23" REF="31">
<HI>Bath</HI> became in &s;ome mea&s;ure frequented by people of di&s;tinction. The company was numerous enough to form a country dance upon the bowling green; they were amu&s;ed with a fiddle and hautboy, and diverted with the romantic walks round the city. They u&s;ually &s;auntered in fine wea|ther in the grove, between two rows of &s;ycamore trees. Several learned Phy&s;ici|ans, Doctor <HI>Jordan,</HI> and others had even then prai&s;ed the &s;alubrity of the wells, and the amu&s;ements were put under the direction of a ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Web&s;ter</HI> was the predece&s;&s;or of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h:</HI> This I take to be the &s;ame gentleman, whom Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> de&s;cribes in his hi&s;tory of the lives of the game&s;ters, by which it appears, that <HI>Bath,</HI> even be|fore the arrival of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> was found a proper retreat for men of that profe&s;|&s;ion. This gentleman, in the year 1704, carried the balls to the town hall, each man paying half a guinea each ball.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="32">Still however, the amu&s;ements of this place were neither elegant, nor conducted with delicacy. General &s;ociety among people of rank or fortune was by no means e&s;tabli&s;hed. The nobility &s;till pre|&s;erved a tincture of <HI>Gothic</HI> haughtine&s;s, and refu&s;ed to keep company with the gentry at any of the public entertainments of the place. Smoaking in the rooms was per|mitted; gentlemen and ladies appeared in a di&s;re&s;pectful manner at public en|tertainments in aprons and boots. With an eagerne&s;s common to tho&s;e, who&s;e plea&s;ures come but &s;eldom, they generally continued them too long, and thus they were rendered di&s;gu&s;ting by too free an enjoyment. If the company liked each other they danced till morning, if any per&s;on lo&s;t at cards, he in&s;i&s;ted on conti|nuing the game till luck &s;hould turn. The lodgings for vi&s;itants were paltry, though expen&s;ive, the dining rooms and other chambers were floored with boards coloured brown with foot and &s;mall beer, to hide the dirt; the walls were covered with unpainted wain&s;cot, the furniture
<PB N="25" REF="33">
corre&s;ponded with the meanne&s;s of the architecture; a few oak chairs, a &s;mall looking gla&s;s, with a fender and tongs, compo&s;ed the magnificence of the&s;e tem|porary habitations. The city was in it&s;elf mean and contemptible, no elegant build|ings, no open &s;treets, nor uniform &s;quares. The Pump-hou&s;e was without any di|rector; the chairmen permitted no gen|tlemen or ladies to walk home by night without in&s;ulting them; and to add to all this, one of the greate&s;t Phy|&s;icians of his age conceived a de&s;ign of ruining the city, by writing again&s;t the efficacy of the waters. It was from a re&s;entment of &s;ome affronts he had re|ceived there, that he took this re&s;olution; and accordingly publi&s;hed a pamphlet, by which he &s;aid, <HI>he would ca&s;t a toad into the &s;pring.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things it was, that Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> fir&s;t came into that city, and hearing the threat of this Phy&s;ician, he humorou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured the people that if they would give him leave, he would
<PB N="26" REF="34">
charm away the poi&s;on of the Doctor's toad, as they u&s;ually charmed the venom of the Tarantula, by mu&s;ic. He therefore was immediately empowered to &s;et up the force of a band of mu&s;ic, again&s;t the poi&s;on of the Doctor's reptile; the company very &s;en&s;ibly encrea&s;ed, <HI>Na&s;h</HI> triumphed, and the &s;overeignty of the city was de|creed to him by every rank of people.</P>
<P>We are now to behold this gentleman as arrived at a new dignity for which na|ture &s;eemed to have formed him; we are to &s;ee him directing plea&s;ures, which none had better learned to &s;hare; placed over rebellious and refractory &s;ubjects that were to be ruled only by the force of his addre&s;s, and governing &s;uch as had been long ac|cu&s;tomed to govern others. We &s;ee a kingdom begining with him, and &s;ending off <HI>Tunbridge</HI> as one of its colonies.</P>
<P>But to talk more &s;imply, when we talk at be&s;t of trifles. None could po&s;&s;ibly conceive a per&s;on more fit to fill this em|ployment than <HI>Na&s;h</HI>: He had &s;ome wit,
<PB N="27" REF="35">
as I have &s;aid once or twice before; but it was of that &s;ort which is rather happy than permanent. Once a week he might &s;ay a good thing, this the little ones about him took care to divulge; or if they hap|pened to forget the joke, he u&s;ually re|membered to repeat it him&s;elf: In a long intercour&s;e with the world he had ac|quired an impenetrable a&s;&s;urance; and the freedom with which he was received by the Great, furni&s;hed him with vicacity which could be commanded at any time, and which &s;ome mi&s;took for wit. His former intercour&s;e among people of fa&s;hion in town, had let him into mo&s;t of the characters of the nobility; and he was ac|quainted with many of their private in|trigues. He under&s;tood rank and prece|dence, with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s, was fond of &s;hew and finery him&s;elf, and generally &s;et a pattern of it to others. The&s;e were his favourite talents, and he was the fa|vourite of &s;uch as had no other.</P>
<P>But to balance the&s;e which &s;ome may con&s;ider as foibles, he was charitable him|&s;elf,
<PB N="28" REF="36">
and generally &s;hamed his betters in|to a &s;imilitude of &s;entiment, if they were not naturally &s;o before. He was fond of advi&s;ing tho&s;e young men, who, by youth and too much money, are taught to look upon extravagance as a virtue. He was an enemy to rudene&s;s in others, though in the latter part of his life he did not much &s;eem to encourage a di&s;like of it by his own example. None talked with more humanity of the foibles of others, when ab&s;ent, than he, nor kept tho&s;e &s;ecrets with which he was entru&s;ted more inviolably. But above all (if mora|li&s;ts will allow it among the number of his virtues) tho' he gamed high, he always play|ed very fairly. The&s;e were his qualifications. Some of the nobility regarded him as an inoffen&s;ive, u&s;eful companion, the &s;ize of who&s;e under&s;tanding was, in general, level with their own; but their little imitators admired him as a per&s;on of fine &s;en&s;e, and great good breeding. Thus people became fond of ranking him in the number of their acquaintance, told over his je&s;ts, and Beau
<PB N="29" REF="37">
<HI>Na&s;h</HI> at length became the fa&s;hionable companion.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t care when made ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, or king of <HI>Bath,</HI> as it is called, was to promote a mu&s;ic &s;ub&s;cription, of one guinea each, for a band which was to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix performers, who were to receive a guinea a week each for their trouble. He allowed al&s;o two guineas a week for lighting and &s;weeping the rooms, for which he accounted to the &s;ub&s;cribers by receipt.</P>
<P>The Pump-hou&s;e was immediately put under the care of an officer, by the name of the <HI>Pumper</HI>; for which he paid the corporation an annual rent. A row of new hou&s;es was begun on the &s;outh &s;ide of the gravel walks, before which a hand|&s;ome pavement was then made for the company to walk on. Not le&s;s than &s;even|teen or eighteen hundred pounds was rai&s;ed this year, and in the beginning of 1706, by &s;ub&s;cription, and laid out in repairing the roads near the city. The
<PB N="30" REF="38">
&s;treets began to be better paved, cleaned and lighted, the licen&s;es of the Chair|men were repre&s;&s;ed, and by an act of par|liament procured on this occa&s;ion, the in|valids, who came to drink or bathe, were exempted from all manner of toll, as often as they &s;hould go out of the city for recreation.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es and &s;treets now began to improve, and ornaments were lavi&s;hed upon them even to profu&s;ion. But in the mid&s;t of this &s;plendor the company &s;till were obliged to a&s;&s;emble in a booth to drink tea and chocolate, or to game. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> undertook to remedy this incon|venience. By his direction, one <HI>Thomas Harri&s;on</HI> erected a hand&s;ome A&s;&s;embly-hou&s;e for the&s;e purpo&s;es. A better band of mu&s;ic was al&s;o procured, and the for|mer &s;ub&s;cription of one guinea, was rai&s;ed to two. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> had three guineas a week for the room and candles, and the mu&s;ic two guineas a man. The money Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> received and accounted for with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s and punctuality.
<PB N="31" REF="39">
To this hou&s;e were al&s;o added gardens for people of rank and fa&s;hion to walk in; and the beauty of the &s;uburbs continued to encrea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition that was made by the corporation, who at that time, looked upon every u&s;eful improvement particularly without the walls, as dangerous to the inhabitants within.</P>
<P>His dominion was now exten&s;ive and &s;ecure, and he determined to &s;upport it with the &s;tricte&s;t attention. But in order to proceed in every thing like a king, he was re&s;olved to give his &s;ubjects a law, and the following rules were accordingly put up in the Pump-room.<Q><LIST>
<HEAD>RULES to be ob&s;erv'd at BATH.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. THAT a vi&s;it of ceremony at fir&s;t coming and another at go|ing away, are all that are expected or de|&s;ired, by ladies of quality and fa&s;hion,&mdash;except impertinents.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. That no per&s;on take it ill that any one goes to another's play, or breakfa&s;t, and not theirs;&mdash;except captious by nature.</ITEM>

<ITEM>6. That gentlemen crowding before the ladies at the ball, &s;hew ill manners; and that none do &s;o for the future,&mdash;except &s;uch as re&s;pect nobody but them&s;elves.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="33" REF="41">7. That no gentleman or lady takes it ill that another dances before them;&mdash;ex|cept &s;uch as have no pretence to dance at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That the elder ladies and children be content with a &s;econd bench at the ball, as being pa&s;t or not come to perfection.</ITEM>

<ITEM>N. B. This does not extend to the <HI>Have-at-alls.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST><P><HI>N. B. Several men of no character, old women and young ones, of que&s;tion'd reputa|tion, are great authors of lies in the&s;e places, being of the &s;ect of levellers.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e laws were written by Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> him&s;elf, and by the manner in which they are drawn up, he undoubtedly de|&s;igned them for wit. The reader, how|ever,
<PB N="34" REF="42">
it is feared, will think them dull. Poor <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was not born a writer; for whatever humour he might have in con|ver&s;ation, he u&s;ed to call a pen his tor|pedo, whenever he gra&s;ped it, it numb|ed all his faculties.</P>
<P>But were we to give laws to a nur&s;ery, we &s;hould make them childi&s;h laws; his &s;tatutes, tho' &s;tupid, were addre&s;&s;ed to fine gentlemen and ladies, and were pro|bably received with &s;ympathetic approba|tion. It is certain, they were in general religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved by his &s;ubjects, and executed by him with impartiality, nei|ther rank nor fortune &s;hielded the refractory from his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The balls by his directions were to be|gin at &s;ix, and to end at eleven. Nor would he &s;uffer them to continue a moment longer, le&s;t invalids might commit irregu|larities, to counteract the benefit of the waters. Every thing was to be perform|ed in proper order. Each ball was to open with a minuet, danced by two per|&s;ons
<PB N="35" REF="43">
of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction pre&s;ent. When the minuet concluded, the lady was to return to her &s;eat, and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was to bring the gentleman a new partner. This ceremony was to be ob&s;erved by every &s;ucceeding couple, every gentleman being obliged to dance with two ladies till the minuets were over, which generally continued two hours. At eight the coun|try dances were to begin, ladies of quality, according to their rank, &s;tanding up fir&s;t. About nine o' clock a &s;hort interval was allowed for re&s;t, and for the gentlemen to help their partners to tea. That over, the company were to pur&s;ue their amu&s;e|ments till the clock &s;truck eleven. Then the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies entering the ball-room, ordered the mu&s;ic to de&s;i&s;t by lifting up his finger. The dances di&s;con|tinued, and &s;ome time allowed for be|coming cool, the ladies were handed to their chairs.</P>
<P>Even the royal family them&s;elves had not influence enough to make him deviate from any of the&s;e rules. The prince&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="44">
<HI>Amelia</HI> once applying to him for one dance more, after he had given the &s;ignal to withdraw, he a&s;&s;ured her royal highne&s;s, that the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of <HI>Bath</HI> re&s;embled the laws of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> which would admit of no alteration, without an utter &s;ubver|&s;ion of all his authority.</P>
<P>He was not le&s;s &s;trict with regard to the dre&s;&s;es, in which ladies and gentlemen were to appear. He had the &s;tronge&s;t aver|&s;ion to a white apron, and ab&s;olutely ex|cluded all who ventured to appear at the a&s;&s;embly dre&s;&s;ed in that manner. I have known him on a ball night &s;trip even the dutche&s;s of <HI>Q&mdash;,</HI> and throw her apron at one of the hinder benches among the ladies women; ob&s;erving, that none but <HI>Abigails</HI> appeared in white aprons. This from another would be in&s;ult, in him it was con&s;idered as a ju&s;t reprimand; and the good-natured dutche&s;s acquie&s;ced in his cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>But he found more difficulty in attack|ing the gentlemens irregularities; and for
<PB N="37" REF="45">
&s;ome time &s;trove, but in vain, to prohibit the u&s;e of &s;words. Di&s;putes ari&s;ing from love or play, were &s;ometimes attended with fatal effects. To u&s;e his own expre&s;|&s;ion, he was re&s;olved to hinder people from doing, <HI>what they had no mind to,</HI> but for &s;ome time without effect. However, there happened about that time, a duel between two game&s;ters, who&s;e names were <HI>Taylor</HI> and <HI>Clarke,</HI> which helped to pro|mote his peaceable intentions. They fought by torch-light in the grove; <HI>Tay|lor</HI> was run through the body, but lived &s;even years after, at which time his wound breaking out afre&s;h, it cau&s;ed his death. <HI>Clarke</HI> from that time pretended to be a Quaker, but the orthodox brethren never cordially received him among their num|ber; and he died at <HI>London,</HI> about eigh|teen years after, in poverty and contrition. From that time it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to forbid the wearing of &s;words at <HI>Bath,</HI> as they often tore the ladies cloaths, and fright|ed them, by &s;ometimes appearing upon tri|fling occa&s;ions. Whenever therefore <HI>Na&s;h</HI> heard of a challenge given, or accepted, he
<PB N="38" REF="46">
in&s;tantly had both parties arre&s;ted. The gentlemen's boots al&s;o made a very de&s;perate &s;tand again&s;t him, the country '&s;quires were by no means &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his u&s;urpations; and probably his authority alone would never have carried him thro', had he not re|inforced it with ridicule. He wrote a &s;ong upon the occa&s;ion, which, for the honour of his poetical talents, the world &s;hall &s;ee.<Q><LG>

<PB N="39" REF="47">
which was at that time highly reli&s;hed by many of the nobility at <HI>Bath,</HI> gained him a temporary triumph. But to pu&s;h his victories, he got up a puppet &s;hew, in which punch came in booted and &s;purred, in the character of a country '&s;quire. He was introduced as courting his mi&s;tre&s;s, and having obtained her con&s;ent to comply with his wi&s;hes, upon going to bed, he is de&s;ired to pull off his boots. My boots, replies punch, why, madam, you may as well bid me pull off my legs. I never go without boots, I never ride, I never dance without them; and this piece of politene&s;s is quite the thing at <HI>Bath.</HI> We always dance at our town in boots, and the ladies often move mi|nuets in riding-hoods. Thus he goes on, till his mi&s;tre&s;s, grown impatient, kicks him off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>From that time few ventured to appear at the a&s;&s;emblies in <HI>Bath</HI> in a riding-dre&s;s; and whenever any gentleman, thro' igno|rance, or ha&s;te, appeared in the rooms in boots, <HI>Na&s;h</HI> would make up to him, and
<PB N="40" REF="48">
bowing in an arch manner, would tell him, that he had forgot his hor&s;e. Thus he was at la&s;t completely victorious.<Q><L><HI>Doli&s;&abque; ccacti</HI></L>

<P>He began therefore to reign without a rival, and like other kings had his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, flatterers, enemies and calumniators; the amu&s;ements of the place however wore a very different a&s;pect from what they did formerly. Regularity repre&s;&s;ed pride, and that le&s;&s;ened, people of fortune became fit for &s;ociety. Let the moro&s;e and grave cen&s;ure an attention to forms and ceremo|nies, and rail at tho&s;e, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s it is to regulate them; but tho' ceremony is very different from politene&s;s, no coun|try was ever yet polite, that was not fir&s;t ceremonious. The natural gradation of breeding begins in &s;avage di&s;gu&s;t, pro|ceeds to indifference, improves into atten|tion, by degrees refines into ceremonious ob&s;ervance, and the trouble of being cere|monious at length produces politene&s;s,

elegance and ea&s;e. There is therefore &s;ome merit in mending &s;ociety, even in one of the inferior &s;teps of this gradation; and no man was more happy in this re&s;pect than Mr. <HI>Na&s;h.</HI> In every nation there are enough who have no other bu&s;ine&s;s or care but that of buying plea&s;ure; and he taught them, who bid at &s;uch an auction, the art of procuring what they &s;ought without dimini&s;hing the plea&s;ure of others.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Bath,</HI> by &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity, &s;oon became the theatre of &s;ummer amu&s;e|ments for all people of fa&s;hion; and the manner of &s;pending the day there mu&s;t amu&s;e any, but &s;uch as di&s;ea&s;e or &s;pleen had made unea&s;y to them&s;elves. The follow|ing is a faint picture of the plea&s;ures that &s;cene affords. Upon a &s;tranger's arrival at <HI>Bath</HI> he is welcomed by a peal of the Abbey bells, and in the next place, by the voice and mu&s;ic of the city waits. For the&s;e civilities the ringers have gene|rally a pre&s;ent made them of half a guinea, and the waits of half a crown, or more, in proportion to the per&s;on's fortune, genero|&s;ity
<PB N="42" REF="50">
or o&s;tentation. The&s;e cu&s;toms, tho' di&s;agreeable, are however genarally liked, or they would not continue. The greate&s;t incommodity attending them is the di&s;tur|bance the bells mu&s;t give the &s;ick. But the plea&s;ure of knowing the name of every family that comes to town recom|pences the inconvenience. Invalids are fond of news, and upon the fir&s;t &s;ound of the bells, every body &s;ends out to en|quire for whom they ring.</P>
<P>After the family is thus welcomed to <HI>Bath,</HI> it is the cu&s;tom for the ma&s;ter of it to go to the public places, and &s;ub&s;cribe two gui|neas at the a&s;&s;embly-hou&s;es towards the balls and mu&s;ic in the pump-hou&s;e, for which he is entitled to three tickets every ball night. His next &s;ub&s;cription is a crown, half a guinea, or a guinea, according to his rank and quality, for the liberty of walking in the private walks be|longing to <HI>Simp&s;on</HI>'s a&s;&s;embly-hou&s;e; a crown or half a guinea is al&s;o given to the book&s;ellers, for which the gentleman is to have what books he plea&s;es to read at his
<PB N="43" REF="51">
lodgings. And at the coffee-hou&s;e another &s;ub&s;cription is taken for pen, ink and paper, for &s;uch letters as the &s;ub&s;criber &s;hall write at it during his &s;tay. The ladies too may &s;ub&s;cribe to the book&s;ellers, and to an hou&s;e by the pump-room, for the advan|tage of reading the news, and for enjoying each other's conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Things being thus adju&s;ted, the amu&s;e|ments of the day are generally begun by bathing, which is no unplea&s;ing method of pa&s;&s;ing away an hour, or &s;o.</P>
<P>The baths are five in number. On the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the abbey church is the King's Bath; which is an oblong &s;quare, the walls are full of niches, and at every corner are &s;teps to de&s;cend into it: this bath is &s;aid to contain 427 tons and 50 gallons of water; and on its ri&s;ing out of the ground over the &s;prings, it is &s;ome|times too hot to be endured by tho&s;e who bathe therein. Adjoining to the King's Bath there is another, called the Queen's Bath; this is of more temperate warmth, as borrowing its water from the other.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52">In the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the city are three other baths, viz. The Hot Bath, which is not much inferior in heat to the King's Bath, and contains 53 tons 2 hog&s;heads, and 11 gallons of water. The Cro&s;s Bath, which contains 52 tons 3 hog&s;heads, and 11 gallons; and the Leper's Bath, which is not &s;o much frequented as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The King's Bath (according to the be&s;t ob&s;ervations) will fill in about nine hours and a half; the Hot Bath in about eleven hours and a half; and the Cro&s;s Bath in about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The hours for bathing are commonly be|tween &s;ix and nine in the morning; and the Baths are every morning &s;upplied with fre&s;h water; for when the people have done bathing, the &s;luices in each Bath are pulled up, and the water is carried off by drains into the river Avon.</P>
<P>In the morning the lady is brought in a clo&s;e chair, dre&s;&s;ed in her bathing cloaths, to the Bath; and, being in the water,
<PB N="45" REF="53">
the woman who attends, pre&s;ents her with a little floating di&s;h like a ba&s;on; into which the lady puts an handkerchief, a &s;nuff-box, and a no&s;egay. She then traver&s;es the Bath; if a novice with a guide, if otherwi&s;e by her&s;elf; and hav|ing amu&s;ed her&s;elf thus while &s;he thinks proper, calls for her chair, and returns to her lodgings.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ement of bathing is immedi|ately &s;ucceeded by a general a&s;&s;embly of people at the pump-hou&s;e, &s;ome for plea|&s;ure, and &s;ome to drink the hot waters. Three gla&s;&s;es, at three different times, is the u&s;ual portion for every drinker; and the intervals between every gla&s;s are enli|vened by the harmony of a &s;mall band of mu&s;ic, as well as by the conver&s;ation of the gay, the witty, or the forward.</P>
<P>From the pump-hou&s;e the ladies, from time to time, withdraw to a female coffee-hou&s;e, and from thence return to their lodgings to breakfa&s;t. The gentlemen withdraw to their coffee-hou&s;es,
<PB N="46" REF="54">
to read the papers, or conver&s;e on the news of the day, with a freedom and ea&s;e not to be found in the metropolis.</P>
<P>People of fa&s;hion make public break|fa&s;ts at the a&s;&s;embly-hou&s;es, to which they invite their acquaintances, and they &s;ometimes order private concerts; or when &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, attend lectures upon the arts and &s;ciences, which are frequently taught there in a pretty &s;uperficial man|ner, &s;o as not to teize the under&s;tanding, while they afford the imagination &s;ome amu&s;ement. The private concerts are performed in the ball-rooms, the tickets a crown each.</P>
<P>Concert breakfa&s;ts at the a&s;&s;embly-hou&s;e, &s;ometimes make al&s;o a part of the morning's amu&s;ement here, the expen|ces of which are defrayed by a &s;ub&s;cripti|on among the men. Per&s;ons of rank and fortune who can perform are admit|ted into the orche&s;tra, and find a plea&s;ure in joining with the performers.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">Thus we have the tedious morning fairly over. When noon approaches, and church (if any plea&s;e to go there) is done, &s;ome of the company appear upon the parade, and other public walks, where they continue to chat and amu&s;e each other, 'till they have formed parties for the play, cards, or dancing for the eve|ning. Another part of the company divert them&s;elves with reading in the book&s;ellers &s;hops, or are generally &s;een taking the air and exerci&s;e, &s;ome on hor&s;eback, &s;ome in coaches. Some walk in the meadows round the town, winding along the &s;ide of the river Avon, and the neighbouring canal; while others are &s;een &s;caling &s;ome of tho&s;e ro|mantic precipices that over-hang the city.</P>
<P>When the hour of dinner draws nigh, and the company is returned from their different recreations, the provi&s;ions are generally &s;erved with the utmo&s;t elegance and plenty. Their mutton, butter, fi&s;h, and fowl, are all allowed to be excellent, and their cookery &s;till exceeds their meat.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56">After dinner is over, and evening pray|ers ended, the company meet a &s;econd time at the pump-hou&s;e. From this they retire to the walks, and from thence go to drink tea at the a&s;&s;embly-hou&s;es, and the re&s;t of the evenings are concluded either with balls, plays or vi&s;its. A theatre was erected in the year 1705 by &s;ub&s;cription, by people of the highe&s;t rank, who per|mitted their arms to be engraven on the in&s;ide of the hou&s;e, as a public te&s;timony of their liberality towards it. Every tue&s;day and friday evening is concluded with a public ball, the contributions to which are &s;o numerous, that the price of each ticket is trifling. Thus Bath yields a continued rotation of diver&s;ions, and peo|ple of all ways of thinking, even from the libertine to the methodi&s;t, have it in their power to complete the day with employ|ments &s;uited to their inclinations.</P>
<P>In this manner every amu&s;ement &s;oon improved under Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s admini&s;tra|tion.
<PB N="49" REF="57">
The magi&s;trates of the city found, that he was nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful, and took every opportunity of paying the &s;ame re|&s;pect to his fictitious royalty, that is gene|rally extorted by real power. The &s;ame &s;atisfaction a young lady finds upon be|ing &s;ingled out at her fir&s;t appearance; or an applauded poet, on the &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t tragedy, influenced him. All admir|ed him as an extraordinary character; and &s;ome who knew no better, as a very fine gentleman; he was perfectly happy in their little applau&s;e, and affected at length &s;omething particular in his dre&s;s, behavi|our and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>His equipage was &s;umptuous, and he u&s;ually travelled to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in a po&s;t chariot and &s;ix greys, with out-riders, foot|men, <HI>French</HI> horns, and every other appen|dage of expen&s;ive parade. He always wore a white hat, and, to apologize for this &s;ingularity, &s;aid, he did it purely to &s;ecure it from being &s;tolen; his dre&s;s was tawdry, tho' not perfectly genteel; he might be con&s;idered as a beau of &s;everal generations,
<PB N="50" REF="58">
and in his appearance he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, mixed the fa&s;hions of the la&s;t age with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent. He perfectly under|&s;tood elegant expence, and generally pa&s;&s;ed his time in the very be&s;t company, if per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction de&s;erve that title.</P>
<P>But I hear the reader now demand, what finances were to &s;upport all this finery, or where the trea&s;ures, that gave him &s;uch frequent opportunities of di&s;playing his benevolence, or his vanity? To an&s;wer this, we mu&s;t now enter upon another part of his character, his talents as a game&s;ter; for by gaming alone at that period, of which I &s;peak, he kept up &s;o very genteel an appearance. When he fir&s;t figured at <HI>Bath,</HI> there were few laws again&s;t this de|&s;tructive amu&s;ement. The gaming-table was the con&s;tant re&s;ource of de&s;pair and indigence, and the frequent ruin of opulent fortunes. Wherever people of fa&s;hion came, needy adventurers were gene|rally found in waiting. With &s;uch <HI>Bath</HI> &s;warmed, and among this cla&s;s Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="59">
was certainly to be numbered in the be|ginning, only with this difference, that he wanted the corrupt heart, too common|ly attending a life of expedients; for he was generous, humane and honourable, even tho' by profe&s;&s;ion a game&s;ter.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and in&s;tances might be given of his integrity, even in this infamous pro|fe&s;&s;ion; where his genero&s;ity often im|pelled him to act in contradiction to his intere&s;t. Wherever he found a novice in the hands of a &s;harper, he generally fore|warned him of the danger; whenever he found any inclined to play, yet ignorant of the game, he would offer his &s;er|vices, and play for them. I remember an in&s;tance to this effect, tho' too nearly concerned in the affair to publi&s;h the gentleman's name of whom it is re|lated. In the year 1725, there came to <HI>Bath</HI> a giddy youth, who had ju&s;t re&s;igned his fellow&s;hip at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He brought his whole fortune with him there, it was but a trifle, however he was re&s;olved to venture it all. Good fortune &s;eemed kind|er
<PB N="52" REF="60">
than could be expected. Without the &s;malle&s;t &s;kill in play, he won a &s;um &s;uffi|cient to make any unambitious man happy. His de&s;ire of gain encrea&s;ing with his gains, in the <HI>October</HI> following he was <HI>at all,</HI> and added four thou&s;and pounds to his former capital. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> one night, after lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;um to this un|de&s;erving &s;on of fortune, invited him to &s;upper. Sir, cried this hone&s;t, tho' vete|ran game&s;ter, perhaps you may ima|gine I have invited you, in order to have my revenge at home; but, &s;ir! I &s;corn &s;o inho&s;pitable an action. I de&s;ired the fa|vour of your company to give you &s;ome advice, which you will pardon me, Sir, you &s;eem to &s;tand in need of. You are now high in &s;pirits, and drawn away by a torrent of &s;ucce&s;s. But there will come a time, when you will repent having left the calm of a college life for the turbulent profe&s;&s;ion of a game&s;ter. Ill runs, will come, as &s;ure as day and night &s;ucceed each other. Be therefore advi&s;ed, remain content with your pre&s;ent gains; for be per&s;uaded, that had you the bank of <HI>England,</HI> with
<PB N="53" REF="61">
your pre&s;ent ignorance of gaming, it would vani&s;h like a fairy dream. You are a &s;tranger to me, but to convince you of the part I take in your welfare, I'll give you fifty guineas, to forfeit twenty, every time you lo&s;e two hundred at one &s;itting. The young gentleman refu&s;ed his offer, and was at la&s;t undone!</P>
<P>The late duke of <HI>B.</HI> being chagrined at lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;um, pre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> to tie him up for the future from play|ing deep. Accordingly, the beau gave his grace an hundred guineas to forfeit ten thou&s;and, whenever he lo&s;t a &s;um to the &s;ame amount at play, in one &s;itting. The duke loved play to di&s;traction, and &s;oon after at hazard lo&s;t eight thou&s;and guineas, and was going to throw for three thou&s;and more; when <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> catching hold of the dice|box, entreated his Grace to reflect upon the penalty if he lo&s;t; the Duke for that time de&s;i&s;ted; but &s;o &s;trong was the furor of play upon him, that &s;oon after, lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;um at <HI>New-market,</HI> he was contented to pay the penalty.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="62">When the late earl of <HI>T&mdash;d</HI> was a youth, he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of play, and never better plea&s;ed than with having Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> for his antagoni&s;t. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;aw with concern his lord&s;hip's foible, and undertook to cure him, tho' by a very di&s;|agreeable remedy. Con&s;cious of his own &s;uperior &s;kill, he determined to en|gage him in &s;ingle play for a very con|&s;iderable &s;um. His lord&s;hip, in propor|tion as he lo&s;t his game, lo&s;t his temper too; and as he approached the gulph, &s;eemed &s;till more eager for ruin. He lo&s;t his e&s;tate; &s;ome writings were put into the winner's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; his very equipage was depo&s;ited as a la&s;t &s;take, and he lo&s;t that al&s;o. But, when our generous game|&s;ter had found his lord&s;hip &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for his temerity, he returned all; only &s;tipulating, that he &s;hould be paid five thou&s;and pound whenever he &s;hould think proper to make the demand. However, he never made any &s;uch demand during his lord&s;hip's life; but &s;ome time after his de|cea&s;e, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s affairs, being in the
<PB N="55" REF="63">
wane, he demanded the money of his lord&s;hip's heirs, who honourably paid it without any he&s;itation.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;kill <HI>Na&s;h</HI> might have acquired by long practice in play, he was never formed by nature for a &s;ucce&s;sful game&s;ter. He was con&s;titutionally pa&s;&s;ion|ate and generous. To acquire a perfection in that art, a man mu&s;t be naturally phleg|matic, re&s;erved and cool; every pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t learn to obey controul; but he fre|quently was unable to re&s;train the violence of his, and was often betrayed by this means into unbecoming rudene&s;s, or childi&s;h impertinence; was &s;ometimes a minion of fortune, and as often depre&s;t by adver&s;ity. While others made con&s;ider|able fortunes at the gaming-table, he was ever in the power of chance; nor did even the intimacy with which he was received by the great, place him in a &s;tate of inde|pendance.</P>
<P>The con&s;iderable inconveniencies that were found to re&s;ult from a permi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="56" REF="64">
gaming, at length attracted the attention of the legi&s;lature, and in the twelfth year of his late maje&s;ty, the mo&s;t prevalent games at that time were declared fraudu|lent and unlawful. Every age has had its peculiar modes of gaming. The games of Gleek, Primero, In and In, and &s;everal others now exploded, employed our &s;harping ance&s;tors; to the&s;e &s;ucceeded the Ace of hearts, Pharaoh, Ba&s;&s;et, and Hazard, all games of chance like the former. But tho' in the&s;e the chances &s;eemed equal to the novice; in general tho&s;e who kept the bank were con&s;iderable winners. The act therefore, pa&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, declared all &s;uch games and lotteries illicit, and directed, that all who &s;hould &s;et up &s;uch games, &s;hould forfeit two hundred pounds, to be levied by di&s;tre&s;s on the offender's goods; one third to go to the informer, the re&s;i|due to the poor.</P>
<P>The act further declared, that every per&s;on who played in any place, ex|cept in the royal palace where his maje&s;ty
<PB N="57" REF="65">
re&s;ided, &s;hould forfeit fifty pounds, and &s;hould be condemned to pay treble co&s;ts in ca&s;e of an appeal.</P>
<P>This law was &s;carcely made, before it was eluded by the invention of divers fraudulent and deceitful games; and a particular game, called Pa&s;&s;age, was daily practi&s;ed, and contributed to the ruin of thou&s;ands. To prevent this, the en&s;uing year it was enacted, that this and every other game invented, or to be invented with one die, or more, or any other in&s;trument of the &s;ame nature, with numbers thereon, &s;hould be &s;ubject to a &s;imilar penalty; and at the &s;ame time, the per&s;ons playing with &s;uch in&s;tru|ments &s;hould be puni&s;hed as above.</P>
<P>This amendment of the law &s;oon gave birth to new eva&s;ions; the game of Rolly Polly, Marlborough's Battles, but particu|larly the E O, were &s;et up; and &s;trange to ob&s;erve! &s;everal of tho&s;e very noblemen, who had given their voices to &s;uppre&s;s gaming, were the mo&s;t ready to encourage
<PB N="58" REF="66">
it. This game was at fir&s;t &s;et up at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> It was invented by one <HI>C&mdash;k,</HI> and carried on between him and one Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> proprietor of the a&s;&s;embly-room at that place; and was reckoned extremely profitable to the bank, as it gained two and an half per cent. on all that was lo&s;t or won.</P>
<P>As all gaming was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed but this, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was now utterly de&s;titute of any re&s;ource that he could expect from his &s;u|perior &s;kill, and long experience in the art. The money to be gained in private gaming is at be&s;t but trifling, and the opportunity precarious. The minds of the generality of mankind &s;hrink with their circum&s;tances; and <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> upon the immediate pro&s;pect of poverty, was now mean enough (I will call it no wor&s;e) to enter into a ba&s;e confederacy with tho&s;e low creatures to evade the law, and to &s;hare the plunder. The occa&s;ion was as follows. The profits of the table were, as I ob&s;erved, divided between <HI>C&mdash;k</HI> the inventor, and <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> the room-keeper.
<PB N="59" REF="67">
The fir&s;t year's profits were extraordinary, and <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> the room-keeper now began to wi&s;h him&s;elf &s;ole proprietor. The com|binations of the worthle&s;s are ever of &s;hort duration. The next year therefore <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> turned <HI>C&mdash;k</HI> out of his room, and &s;et up the game for him&s;elf. The gentlemen and ladies who frequented the wells, unmind|ful of the immen&s;e profit gained by the&s;e reptiles, &s;till continued to game as before; and <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> was triumphing in the &s;ucce&s;s of his politics, when he was informed, that <HI>C&mdash;k</HI> and his friends hired the crier to cry the game down. The con&s;equences of this would have been fatal to <HI>A&mdash;e</HI>'s intere&s;t, for by this means frauds might have been di&s;covered, which would deter even the mo&s;t ardent lovers of play. Immediately, therefore, while the crier was yet upon the walks, he applied to Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> to &s;top the&s;e proceedings, and at the &s;ame time offered him a fourth &s;hare of the bank, which Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was mean enough to ac|cept. This is the greate&s;t blot in his life, and this it is hoped will find pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="68">The day after, the inventor offered an half of the bank; but this Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> thought proper to refu&s;e, being pre-en|gaded to <HI>A&mdash;e.</HI> Upon which, being di&s;|appointed, he applied to one Mr. <HI>J&mdash;e,</HI> and under his protection another table was &s;et up, and the company &s;eemed to be divided equally between them. I cannot reflect, without &s;urprize, at the wi&s;dom of the gentlemen and ladies, to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be thus parcelled out between a pack of &s;harpers, and permit them&s;elves to be defrauded, without even the &s;hew of oppo&s;ition. The company thus divided, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> once more availed him&s;elf of their parties, and prevailed upon them to unite their banks, and to divide the gains into three &s;hares, of which he re&s;erved one to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h</HI> had hitherto enjoyed a fluctuating fortune; and had he taken the advantage of the pre&s;ent opportunity, he might have been for the future not only above want, but even in circum&s;tances of opulence. Had he cautiou&s;ly employed him&s;elf in
<PB N="61" REF="69">
computing the benefits of the table, and ex|acting his &s;tipulated &s;hare, he might have &s;oon grown rich; but he entirely left the management of it to the people of the rooms; he took them (as he &s;ays in one of his memorials upon this occa&s;ion) to be ho|ne&s;t, and never enquired what was won or lo&s;t; and, it is probable, they were &s;eldom a&s;&s;iduous in informing him. I find a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in thus di&s;playing the in&s;ecurity of friend&s;hips among the ba&s;e. They pre|tended to pay him regularly at fir&s;t, but he &s;oon di&s;covered, as he &s;ays, that at <HI>Tun|bridge</HI> he had &s;uffered to the amount of two thou&s;and guineas.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the E O table thus &s;ucceeded at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was re&s;olved to introduce it at <HI>Bath,</HI> and previou&s;ly a&s;ked the opinion of &s;everal law|yers, who declared it no way illegal. In con&s;equence of this, he wrote to Mrs. <HI>A&mdash;,</HI> who kept one of the great rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> acquainting her with the profits attend|ing &s;uch a &s;cheme, and propo&s;ing to have a fourth &s;hare with her, and Mr. <HI>W&mdash;,</HI> the pro|prietor of the other room, for his authority,
<PB N="62" REF="70">
and protection. To this Mr. <HI>W&mdash;</HI> and &s;he returned him for an&s;wer, that they would grant him a fifth &s;hare; which he con&s;ented to accept. Accordingly he made a journey to <HI>London,</HI> and be&s;poke two tables, one for each room, at the rate of fifteen pounds each table.</P>
<P>The tables were no &s;ooner &s;et up at <HI>Bath,</HI> than they were frequented with a greater concour&s;e of game&s;ters than tho&s;e at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> Men of that infamous pro|fe&s;&s;ion, from every part of the kingdom, and even other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> flocked here to feed on the ruins of each other's for|tune. This afforded another opportunity for Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> to become rich; but, as at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he thought the people here al&s;o would take care of him, and therefore he employed none to look after his intere&s;t. The fir&s;t year they paid him what he thought ju&s;t; the next, the woman of the room dying, her &s;on paid him, and &s;hewed his books. Sometime after the people of the rooms offered him one hundred pounds a year each for his &s;hare; which he refu&s;ed;
<PB N="63" REF="71">
every &s;ucceeding year they continued to pay him le&s;s and le&s;s; 'till at length he found, as he pretends, that he had thus lo&s;t not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Thus they proceeded, deceiving the public and each other, 'till the legi&s;lature thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e &s;eminaries of vice. It was enacted, that after the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> 1745, none &s;hould be per|mitted to keep an hou&s;e, room or place, for playing, upon pain of &s;uch forfeitures, as were declared in former acts in&s;tituted for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature likewi&s;e amended a law, made in the reign of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> for recover|ing money lo&s;t at play, on the oath of the winner. By this act no per&s;on was rendered incapable of being a witne&s;s; and every per&s;on pre&s;ent at a gaming-table might be &s;ummoned by the magi&s;trate, who took cognizance of the affair. No privilege of parliament was allowed, to tho&s;e con|victed of having gaming-tables in their
<PB N="64" REF="72">
hou&s;es. Tho&s;e who lo&s;t ten pounds at one time, were liable to be indicted within &s;ix months after the offence was committed; and being convicted, were to be fined five times the value of the &s;um won or lo&s;t, for the u&s;e of the poor. Any offender be|fore conviction, di&s;covering another, &s;o as to be convicted, was to be di&s;charged from the penalties incurred by his own offences.</P>
<P>By this wi&s;e and ju&s;t act, all <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s fu|ture hopes of &s;ucceeding by the tables were blown up. He had now only the ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity of his confederates to tru&s;t to; but that he &s;oon found to be a vain expectation; for, if we can depend on his own memorials, what at one time they confe&s;&s;ed, they would at another deny; and tho' upon &s;ome occa&s;ions they &s;eemed at variance with each other, yet when they were to oppo&s;e him, whom they con&s;idered as a common enemy, they generally united with confidence and &s;uc|ce&s;s. He now therefore had nothing but a law-&s;uit to confide in for redre&s;s; and this is ever the la&s;t expedient to retrieve a
<PB N="65" REF="73">
de&s;perate fortune, He accordingly threw his &s;uit into Chancery, and by this means the public became acquainted with what he had long endeavoured to conceal. They now found that he was him&s;elf concern|ed in the gaming-tables, of which he only &s;eemed the conductor; and that he had &s;hared part of the &s;poil, tho' he com|plained of having been defrauded of a ju&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;uit was what might have been naturally expected; he had but at be&s;t a bad cau&s;e, and as the oaths of the defendants were alone &s;ufficient to ca&s;t him in Chancery, it was not &s;urpri|zing that he was non&s;uited. But the con|&s;equence of this affair was much more fa|tal than he had imagined, it le&s;&s;ened him in the e&s;teem of the public, it drew &s;everal enemies again&s;t him, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure dimini&s;hed the authority of any defence he could make. From that time (about the year 1745) I find this poor, good-natured, but mi&s;guided man involved in continual di&s;putes, every day calumniated with &s;ome
<PB N="66" REF="74">
new &s;lander, and continually endeavour|ing to obviate its effects.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions his u&s;ual method was, by printed bills handed about among his acquaintance, to inform the public of his mo&s;t private tran&s;actions with &s;ome of tho&s;e creatures, with whom he had former|ly a&s;&s;ociated; but the&s;e apologies &s;erved rather to blacken his antagoni&s;ts, than to vindicate him. They were in general ex|tremely ill written, confu&s;ed, ob&s;cure, and &s;ometimes unintelligible. By the&s;e however it appeard, that <HI>W&mdash;</HI> was ori|ginally obliged to him for the re&s;ort of company to his room; that lady <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> who had all the company before <HI>W&mdash;</HI>'s room was built, offered Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> an hundred pound for his protection; which he refu&s;ed, having previou&s;ly promi&s;ed to &s;upport Mrs. <HI>W&mdash;.</HI> It appears by the&s;e apologies, that the per&s;ons concerned in the rooms made large fortunes, while he &s;till continued in pri&s;tine indigence; and that his nephew, for whom he had at fir&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="75">
&s;ecured one of the rooms, was left in as great di&s;tre&s;s as he.</P>
<P>His enemies were not upon this occa&s;ion contented with a&s;per&s;ing him, as a confe|derate with &s;harpers, they even a&s;&s;erted, that he &s;pent, and embezzled the &s;ub&s;crip|tions of gentlemen and ladies, which were given for u&s;eful or charitable purpo&s;es. But to &s;uch a&s;per&s;ions he an&s;wered, by declaring, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, be|fore God and man, that he never divert|ed one &s;hilling of the &s;aid &s;ub&s;criptions to his own u&s;e; nor was he ever thought to have done it, till new enemies &s;tarted up again&s;t him. Perhaps the reader may be curious to &s;ee one of the&s;e memorials, written by him&s;elf; and I will indulge his curio&s;ity, merely to &s;hew a &s;pecimen of the &s;tile and manner of a man, who&s;e whole life was pa&s;t in a round of gaiety and conver&s;ation, who&s;e je&s;ts were a thou|&s;and times repeated, and who&s;e company was courted by every &s;on and daughter of fa&s;hion.

<P>This gentleman's &s;implicity, in tru&s;ting per&s;ons whom he had no previous rea&s;ons to place confidence in, &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e lights into his character, which, while they impeach his under&s;tanding, do honour to his benevolence. The low and timid are ever &s;u&s;picious; but a heart im|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="72" REF="80">
with honourable &s;entiments, ex|pects from others &s;ympathetic &s;incerity.</P>
<P>But now that we have viewed his con|duct as a game&s;ter, and &s;een him on that &s;ide of his character, which is by far the mo&s;t unfavourable, &s;een him declining from his former favour and e&s;teem, the ju&s;t con&s;equence of his quitting, tho' but ever &s;o little, the paths of honour; let me turn to tho&s;e brighter parts of his life and character, which gained the affec|tion of his friends, the e&s;teem of the cor|poration which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and may po&s;&s;ibly attract the attention of po&s;terity. By his &s;ucce&s;&s;es we &s;hall find, that figuring in life, proceeds le&s;s from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great talents, than from the proper application of moderate ones. Some great minds are only fitted to put forth their powers in the &s;torm; and the occa&s;ion is often wanting during a whole life for a great exertion: but trifling opportuni|ties of &s;hining, are almo&s;t every hour offered to the little &s;edulous mind; and a per&s;on thus employed, is not only more
<PB N="73" REF="81">
plea&s;ing, but more u&s;eful in a &s;tate of tran|quil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Tho' gaming fir&s;t introduced him into polite company, this alone could hardly have carried him forward, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a genteel addre&s;s, much viva|city, &s;ome humour, and &s;ome wit. But once admitted into the circle of the Beau Monde, he then laid claim to all the pri|vileges by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed. A|mong others, in the early part of his life, he entered him&s;elf profe&s;&s;edly into the &s;er|vice of the fair &s;ex; he &s;et up for a man of gallantry and intrigue; and if we can credit the boa&s;ts of his old age, he often &s;ucceeded. In fact, the bu&s;ine&s;s of love &s;omewhat re&s;embles the bu&s;ine&s;s of phy&s;ic; no matter for qualifications, he that makes vigorous preten&s;ions to either is &s;ure&s;t of &s;ucce&s;s. Nature had by no means formed Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> for a Beau Gar&ccedil;on; his per&s;on was clum&s;ey, too large and aukward, and his features har&s;h, &s;trong, and peculiarly irregular; yet even, with tho&s;e di&s;advan|tages, he made love, became an univer|&s;al
<PB N="74" REF="82">
admirer of the &s;ex, and was univer&s;ally admired. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t, of &s;ome requi&s;ites of a lover. He had a&s;&s;idui|ty, flattery, fine cloaths, and as much wit as the ladies he addre&s;&s;ed. Wit, flattery, and fine cloaths, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, were enough to debauch a nunnery. But my fair readers of the pre&s;ent day are exempt from this &s;candal; and it is no matter now, what he &s;aid of their grandmothers.</P>
<P>As <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> was a man of three ages, &s;o <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;ometimes humorou&s;ly called him|&s;elf a beau of three generations. He had &s;een flaxen bobs &s;ucceeded by majors, which in their turn gave way to negli|gents, which were at la&s;t totally routed by bags and ramilees. The manner in which gentlemen managed their amours, in the&s;e different ages of fa&s;hion, were not more different than their perriwigs. The lover in the reign of king <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;olemn, maje&s;tic and formal. He vi&s;it|ed his mi&s;tre&s;s in &s;tate. Langui&s;hed for the favour, kneeled when he toa&s;ted his
<PB N="75" REF="83">
godde&s;s, walked with &s;olemnity, per|formed the mo&s;t trifling things with de|corum, and even took &s;nuff with a flouri&s;h. The beau of the latter part of queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s reign was di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o much forma|lity, he was pert, &s;mart and lively; his billet-doux were written in a quite differ|ent &s;tile from that of his antiquated prede|ce&s;&s;or; he was ever laughing at his own ridiculous &s;ituation; till at la&s;t, he per|&s;uaded the lady to become as ridiculous as him&s;elf. The beau of the third age, in which Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> died, was &s;till more extra|ordinary than either; his whole &s;ecret in intrigue con&s;i&s;ted in perfect indifference. The only way to make love now, I have heard Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;ay, was to take no man|ner of notice of the lady, which method was found the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;ecure her affections.</P>
<P>However the&s;e things be, this gentle|man's &s;ucce&s;&s;es in amour were in reality very much confined in the &s;econd and third age of intrigue; his character was too public for a lady to con&s;ign her repu|tation
<PB N="76" REF="84">
to his keeping. But in the begin|ning of life it is &s;aid, he knew the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the times, and contributed him&s;elf to &s;well the page of &s;candal. Were I upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to hold the pen of a noveli&s;t, I could recount &s;ome amours, in which he was &s;ucce&s;sful. I could fill a volume with little anecdotes, which contain neither plea&s;ure nor in&s;truc|tion; with hi&s;tories of profe&s;&s;ing lovers, and poor believing girls deceived by &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions. But &s;uch adventures are ea&s;ily written, and as ea&s;ily atchieved. The plan even of fictitious novel is quite exhau&s;ted; but truth, which I have fol|lowed here, and ever de&s;ign to follow, pre&s;ents in the affair of love &s;carce any variety. The manner in which one re|putation is lo&s;t, exactly re&s;embles that by which another is taken away. The gentleman begins at timid di&s;tance, grows more bold, becomes rude, till the lady is married or undone; &s;uch is the &s;ub&s;tance of every modern novel; nor will I gratify the pruriency of folly,
<PB N="77" REF="85">
at the expence of every other plea&s;ure my narration may afford.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> did not long continue an uni|ver&s;al gallant; but in the earlier years of his reign, entirely gave up his endeavours to deceive the &s;ex, in order to become the hone&s;t protector of their innocence, the guardian of their reputation, and a friend to their virtue.</P>
<P>This was a character he bore for many years, and &s;upported it with integrity, a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s. It was his con&s;tant practice to do every thing in his power to prevent the fatal con&s;equences of ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate love; and there are many per&s;ons now alive, who owe their pre&s;ent happine&s;s to his having interrupted the progre&s;s of an amour, that threatened to become unhappy, or even criminal, by privately making their guardians or pa|rents acquainted with what he could di&s;|cover</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86">I &s;hall beg leave to give &s;ome in&s;tances of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s good-nature on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, as I have had the accounts from him&s;elf. At the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> colonel <HI>M&mdash;</HI> was one of the thoughtle&s;s, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the attention of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talk|ed with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he &s;hewed, that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune however was a trifle, when compared to the elegance of his expence; and his imprudence at la&s;t was &s;o great, that it obliged him to &s;ell an annuity, ari|&s;ing from his commi&s;&s;ion, to keep up his &s;plendor a little longer.</P>
<P>However thoughtle&s;s he might be, he had the happine&s;s of gaining the affections of Mi&s;s <HI>L&mdash;,</HI> who&s;e father de&s;igned her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of di&s;tinction, but &s;he refu&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olved upon
<PB N="79" REF="87">
gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice. The intrigue went on &s;ucce&s;s|fully between her and the colonel, and they both would certainly have been mar|ried, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> apprized her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> a very con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, for the care he had taken, which he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time colonel <HI>M&mdash;</HI> had an intimation how his intrigue came to be di&s;covered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> &s;ound that his &s;u&s;picions were not without foundation. A challenge was the imme|diate con&s;equence, which the king of <HI>Bath,</HI> con&s;cious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear &s;words at <HI>Bath,</HI> the colonel found no opportunity of gratify|ing his re&s;entment, and waited with im|patience to find Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> in town, to re|quire proper &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="88">During this interval, however, he found his creditors become too importunate for him to remain longer at <HI>Bath</HI>; and his finances and credit being quite exhau&s;ted, he took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of going over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he enli&s;ted him&s;elf a volunteer. Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private cen|tinel, with the additional mi&s;ery of receiv|ing no pay, and his friends in <HI>England</HI> gave out, that he was &s;hot at the battle of &mdash;</P>
<P>In the mean time the nobleman pre&s;&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion with ardour, but during the progre&s;s of his amour, the young lady's father died, and left her heire&s;s to a for|tune of fifteen hundred a year. She thought her&s;elf now di&s;engaged from her former pa&s;&s;ion. An ab&s;ence of two years had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated her love for the colonel; and the a&s;&s;iduity, the merit, and real regard of the gentleman who &s;till continued to &s;olicit her, were almo&s;t too powerful for her con&s;tancy. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="89">
in the mean time, took every opportunity of enquiring after colonel <HI>M&mdash;,</HI> and found, that he had for &s;ome time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his creditors; and that he was entered into a company of &s;trolling players, who were at that time exhibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the colonel, in ju&s;tice, an opportunity of pro|moting his fortune, as he had once de|prived him of an occa&s;ion of &s;atisfying his love. Our Beau therefore invited the lady to be of a party to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the mo&s;t elegant in <HI>England,</HI> to conduct her there. The propo&s;al being accepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> arrived in town ju&s;t as the players were going to begin.</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>M&mdash;,</HI> who u&s;ed every means of remaining <HI>incognito,</HI> and who was too proud to make his di&s;tre&s;&s;es known to any of his former acquaintance, was now de|graded
<PB N="82" REF="90">
into the character of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>L&mdash;</HI> was placed in the foremo&s;t row of the &s;pectators, her lord on one &s;ide, and the impatient <HI>Na&s;h</HI> on the other; when the unhappy youth appeared in that de&s;picable &s;ituation upon the &s;tage. The moment he came on, his former mi&s;tre&s;s &s;truck his view, but his amazement was encrea&s;ed, when he &s;aw her fainting away in the arms of tho&s;e who &s;ate behind her. He was incapable of proceeding, and &s;carce knowing what he did, he flew and caught her in his arms.</P>
<P>Colonel, cried <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> when they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered, you once thought me your enemy, becau&s;e I endea|voured to prevent you both from ruining each other, you were then wrong, and you have long had my forgivene&s;s. If you love well enough now for matrimony, you fairly have my con&s;ent, and d&mdash;n him, &s;ay I, that attempts to part you. Their nuptials were &s;olemnized &s;oon after, and affluence added a ze&s;t to all their fu|ture enjoyments. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> had the
<PB N="83" REF="91">
thanks of each, and he afterwards &s;pent &s;everal agreeable days in that &s;ociety, which he had contributed to render happy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall beg the reader's patience, while I give another in&s;tance, in which he in|effectually offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice. This &s;tory is not from him&s;elf; but told us partly by Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect of <HI>Bath,</HI> as it fell particularly within his own knowledge; and partly from another memoir, to which he refers.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Sylvia S&mdash;</HI> was de&s;cended from one of the be&s;t families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her Si&s;ter's decea&s;e. She had early in life been intro|duced into the be&s;t company, and con|tracted a pa&s;&s;ion for elegance and expence. It is u&s;ual to make the heroine of a &s;tory very witty, and very beautiful, and &s;uch circum&s;tances are &s;o &s;urely expected, that they are &s;carce attended to. But what|ever the fine&s;t poet could conceive of wit, or the mo&s;t celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections
<PB N="84" REF="92">
of this young lady. Her &s;uperiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had &s;een her. She was natu|rally gay, generous to a fault, good-na|tured to the highe&s;t degree, affable in conver&s;ation, and &s;ome of her letters, and other writings, as well in ver&s;e as pro&s;e, would have &s;hone among&s;t tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>But the&s;e great qualifications were mark|ed by another, which le&s;&s;ened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honour &s;uffered by her imprudence; I only mean, &s;he had no knowledge of the u&s;e of money, &s;he relieved di&s;tre&s;s, by putting her&s;elf into the circum&s;tances of the object who&s;e wants &s;he &s;upplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repetition of new flattery, had taught her to think &s;he could never be for&s;aken, and never poor. Young ladies

are apt to expect a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, from a number of lovers; and yet I have &s;eldom &s;een a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an hu&s;band in any. Before the choice is fixed, &s;he has either lo&s;t her reputation, or her good &s;en&s;e; and the lo&s;s of either is &s;ufficient to con|&s;ign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers was the celebrated <HI>S&mdash;,</HI> who, at that time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gentleman, with talents that might have done honour to humanity, &s;uffered him&s;elf to fall at length into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of deba&s;ement. He followed the dictates of every newe&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, his love, his pity, his genero|&s;ity, and even his friend&s;hips were all in exce&s;s; he was unable to make head a|gain&s;t any of his &s;en&s;ations or de&s;ires, but they were in general worthy wi&s;hes and de&s;ires; for he was con&s;titutionally virtu|ous. This gentleman, who at la&s;t died in a goal, was at that time this lady's en|vied favourite.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94">It is probable that he, thoughtle&s;s crea|ture, had no other pro&s;pect from this amour, but that of pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent mo|ments agreeably. He only courted di&s;&s;ipa|tion, but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happine&s;s. At length, however, his debts amounting to a con&s;iderable &s;um, he was arre&s;ted, and thrown into pri&s;on. He en|deavoured at fir&s;t to conceal his &s;ituation from his beautiful mi&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he &s;oon came to a knowledge of his di&s;tre&s;s, and took a fatal re&s;olution of freeing him from confinement by di&s;charging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and repre&s;ented to the thoughtle&s;s young lady, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would effectual|ly ruin both; that &s;o warm a concern for the intere&s;ts of Mr. <HI>S&mdash;,</HI> would in the fir&s;t place quite impair her fortune, in the eyes of our &s;ex; and what was wor&s;e, le&s;&s;en her reputation in tho&s;e of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S&mdash;</HI> from pri&s;on, would be only a temporary
<PB N="87" REF="95">
relief; that a mind &s;o generous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and in&s;tead of improving in friend&s;hip or affection, he would only &s;tudy to avoid a creditor he could never repay; that tho' &s;mall favours produce good-will, great ones de&s;troy friend&s;hip. The&s;e admonitions however were di&s;re|garded, and &s;he too late found the pru|dence and truth of her advi&s;er. In &s;hort, her fortune was by this means exhau&s;ted, and, with all her attractions, &s;he found her acquaintance began to di&s;e&s;teem her, in proportion as &s;he became poor.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he accepted Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s invitation of returning to <HI>Bath</HI>; he promi&s;|ed to introduce her to the be&s;t company there, and he was a&s;&s;ured that her merit would do the re&s;t; upon her very fir&s;t appearance, ladies of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction courted her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; but a &s;ettled melancholy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and no amu&s;ements that they could propo&s;e were &s;ufficient to divert it. Yet &s;till, as if from habit, &s;he followed the
<PB N="88" REF="96">
crowd in its levities, and frequented tho&s;e places, where all per&s;ons endeavour to forget them&s;elves in the bu&s;tle of ceremo|ny and &s;hew.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her &s;implicity, and her un|guarded &s;ituation, &s;oon drew the attention of a de&s;igning wretch, who at that time kept one of the rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought, that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account. This woman's name was dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> a creature who, though vicious, was in ap|pearance &s;anctified; and though de&s;igning, had &s;ome wit and humour. She began by the humble&s;t a&s;&s;iduity to ingratiate her&s;elf with mi&s;s <HI>S&mdash;</HI>; &s;hewed, that &s;he could be amu&s;ing as a companion, and by frequent offers of money, proved, that &s;he could be u&s;eful as a friend. Thus by degrees &s;he gained an entire a&s;cendant over this poor, thoughtle&s;s, de&s;erted girl; and in le&s;s than one year, namely about 1727, Mi&s;s <HI>S,</HI> with|out ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of virtue, had entirely lo&s;t her reputation. When|ever a per&s;on was wanting to make up a
<PB N="89" REF="97">
party for play at dame <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>'s, <HI>Sylvia,</HI> as &s;he was then familiarly called, was &s;ent for, and was obliged to &s;uffer all tho&s;e &s;lights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of for|tune.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t, even the greate&s;t minds, the heart at la&s;t becomes level with the mean|ne&s;s of its condition; but in this charm|ing girl, it &s;truggled hard with adver&s;ity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with &s;ullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But tho' in the cour&s;e of three years &s;he was in the very eye of public in&s;pection, yet, Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;erva|tions, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of &s;uffering her&s;elf to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and at her own hazard, playing for the amu&s;e|ment and advantage of others. Her friend Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> therefore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr.
<PB N="90" REF="98">
<HI>Wood</HI>'s hou&s;e, in <HI>Queen &s;quare,</HI> where &s;he behaved with the utmo&s;t complai&s;ance, regularity and virtue.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation her dete&s;tation of life &s;till continued; &s;he found, that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attrac|tions, and that continual &s;olicitude would impair the re&s;t. With the&s;e reflections &s;he would frequently entertain her&s;elf, and an old faithful maid in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> when ever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even &s;ometimes &s;tart que&s;tions in company, with &s;eeming unconcern, in order to know what act of &s;uicide was ea&s;ie&s;t, and which was at|tended with the &s;malle&s;t pain. When tired with exerci&s;e, &s;he generally retired to medi|tation, and &s;he became habituated to early hours of &s;leep and re&s;t. But when the wea|ther prevented her u&s;ual exerci&s;e, and her &s;leep was thus more difficult, &s;he made it a rule to ri&s;e from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till &s;he began to find an in|clination for repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="99">This cu&s;tom made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room. And the maid u&s;u|ally, when &s;he withdrew, locked the chamber door, and pu&s;hing the key under it beyond reach, her mi&s;tre&s;s by that con&s;tant method lay undi&s;turbed till &s;even o' clock in the morning, then &s;he aro&s;e, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a &s;ignal for the maid to return.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of &s;eeming piety, regularity, and prudence continued for &s;ome time, till the gay, celebrated toa&s;ted mi&s;s <HI>Silvia</HI> was &s;unk into an hou&s;ekeeper to the gentleman at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lived. She was unable to keep company for want of the elegancies of dre&s;s, that are the u&s;ual pa&s;&s;port among the polite, and &s;he was too haughty to &s;eem to want them. The fa&s;hionable, the amu|&s;ing, and the polite in &s;ociety now &s;eldom vi&s;ited her, and from being once the object of every eye, &s;he was now de&s;erted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own imprudence.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100">Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Silvia</HI> was left with the re&s;t as a governe&s;s at <HI>Bath.</HI> She &s;ome|times &s;aw Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> and acknowledged the friend&s;hip of his admonitions, tho' &s;he refu&s;ed to accept any other marks of his genero&s;ity than that of advice. Upon the clo&s;e of the day, in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to return from <HI>London,</HI> &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the di&s;appoint|ment of not &s;eeing him; took particular care to &s;ettle the affairs of his family, and then as u&s;ual &s;ate down to meditation. She now ca&s;t a retro&s;pect over her pa&s;t mi&s;conduct, and her approaching mi&s;ery; &s;he &s;aw, that even affluence gave her no real happine&s;s, and from indigence &s;he thought nothing could be hoped but linger|ing calamity. She at length conceived the fatal re&s;olution of leaving a life, in which &s;he could &s;ee no corner for comfort, and terminating a &s;cene of imprudence in &s;ui|cide.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, &s;he &s;ate down at her di|ning-room window, and with cool intre|pidity,
<PB N="93" REF="101">
wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window.<Q><L>O death; thou plea&s;ing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greate&s;t good be|low!</L>
<L>Still may'&s;t thou fly the coward, and the &s;lave,</L>
<L>And thy &s;oft &s;lumbers only ble&s;s the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the mo&s;t chearful &s;erenity; talked of in|different &s;ubjects till &s;upper, which &s;he ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There &s;he &s;pent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber &s;he went into the nur&s;ery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay &s;leeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her meditated guilt, &s;he could not avoid bur&s;ting into tears, and hugging it in her arms; &s;he then bid her old &s;ervant a good night, for the fir&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="102">
time &s;he had ever done &s;o, and went to bed as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>It is probable &s;he &s;oon quitted her bed, and was &s;eized with an alternation of pa&s;|&s;ions, before &s;he yielded to the impul&s;e of de&s;pair. She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in clean lin|nen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her brea&s;t, ju&s;t as a nur&s;e pins the &s;waddling cloaths of an infant. A pink &s;ilk girdle was the in&s;trument with which &s;he re&s;olved to terminate her mi&s;ery, and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread. The end of the for|mer was tied with a noo&s;e, and the lat|ter with three knots, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, &s;he &s;ate down again, and read; for &s;he left the book open at that place, in the &s;tory of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o</HI> of <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bo&s;om friend, &s;he was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event
<PB N="95" REF="103">
gave her fre&s;h &s;pirits to go through her fatal purpo&s;e; &s;o &s;tanding upon a &s;tool, and flinging the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a clo&s;et-door that opened into her chamber, &s;he remained &s;u&s;pended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor de&s;pairer fell upon the floor with &s;uch violence, that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the hou&s;e about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering her&s;elf, &s;he began to walk about the room, as her u&s;ual cu&s;tom was when &s;he wanted &s;leep; and the workman imagining it to be only &s;ome ordinary ac|cident, again went to &s;leep. She once more, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;trong|er girdle made of &s;ilver thread, and this kept her &s;u&s;pended till &s;he died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as u&s;ual for the ringing of the bell, and protracted her patience, hour after hour, till two o' clock in the after|noon; when the workmen at length en|tering
<PB N="96" REF="104">
the room through the window, found their unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till hang|ing, and quite cold. The coroner's jury being impanelled, brought in their verdict lunacy; and her corp&s;e was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female companion, with whom &s;he had for many years an in&s;epara|ble intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toa&s;t, and a game&s;ter; loved, admired, and for&s;aken. Formed for the delight of &s;ociety, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hun|dreds in high life lamented her fate, and wi&s;hed, when too late, to redre&s;s her in|juries. They who once had helped to im|pair her fortune, now regretted that they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;o mean a pur&s;uit. The little effects &s;he had left behind were bought up with the greate&s;t avidity, by tho&s;e who de&s;ired to pre&s;erve &s;ome token of a companion, that once had given them &s;uch delight. The remembrance of every vir|tue &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of was now improv|ed by pity. Her former follies were few,
<PB N="97" REF="105">
but the la&s;t &s;welled them to a large amount. And &s;he remains the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance to po&s;terity, that want of prudence alone, almo&s;t cancels every other virtue.</P>
<P>In all this unfortunate lady's affairs Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> took a peculiar concern, he directed her when they played, advi&s;ed her when &s;he deviated from the rules of caution, and performed the la&s;t offices of friend&s;hip after her decea&s;e, by rai&s;ing the auction of her little effects.</P>
<P>But he was not only the a&s;&s;i&s;tant and the friend of the fair &s;ex, but al&s;o their defen|der. He &s;ecured their per&s;ons from in&s;ult, and their reputations from &s;candal. No|thing offended him more, than a young fellow's pretending to receive favours from ladies he probably never &s;aw; nothing plea&s;ed him &s;o much, as &s;eeing &s;uch a piece of deliberate mi&s;chief puni&s;hed. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> and one of his friends, being newly ar|rived at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> from <HI>Bath,</HI> were one day on the walks, and &s;eeing a young fel|low of fortune, with whom they had &s;ome
<PB N="98" REF="106">
&s;light acquaintance, joined him. After the u&s;ual chat and news of the day was over, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> a&s;ked him, how long he had been at the wells, and what company was there? The other replied, he had been at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> a month; but as for company, he could find as good at a <HI>Tyburn</HI> ball. Not a &s;oul was to be &s;een, except a parcel of game&s;ters and whores, who would grant the la&s;t favour, for a &s;ingle &s;take at the Pharaoh bank. <Q REND="inline">"Look you there, con|tinued he, that Godde&s;s of midnight, &s;o fine, at t'other end of the walks, by Jove, &s;he was mine this morning for half a guinea. And &s;he there, who brings up the rear with powdered hair and dirty ruffles, &s;he's pretty enough, but cheap, perfectly cheap; why, my boys, to my own knowledge, you may have her for a crown, and a di&s;h of chocolate into the bargain. La&s;t <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> night we were happy."</Q> Hold there, &s;ir, cried the gen|tleman; as for your having the fir&s;t lady, it is po&s;&s;ible it may be true, and I intend to a&s;k her about it, for &s;he is my &s;i&s;ter; but as to your lying with the other la&s;t

<HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> I am &s;ure you are a lying ra&s;|cal&mdash;&s;he is my wife, and we came here but la&s;t night. The Buck vainly a&s;ked pardon; the gentleman was going to give him proper cha&s;ti&s;ement; when Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> interpo&s;ed in his behalf, and obtained his pardon, upon condition that he quitted <HI>Tunbridge</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> not only took care, during his admini&s;tration, to protect the ladies from the in&s;ults of our &s;ex, but to guard them from the &s;landers of each other. He, in the fir&s;t place, prevented any animo&s;i|ties that might ari&s;e from place and prece|dence, by being previou&s;ly acquainted with the rank and quality of almo&s;t every family in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions. He en|deavoured to render &s;candal odious, by marking it as the re&s;ult of envy and folly united. Not even <HI>Solon</HI> could have enac|ted a wi&s;er law in &s;uch a &s;ociety as <HI>Bath.</HI> The gay, the heedle&s;s, and the idle, which mo&s;tly compo&s;e the groupe of water-drink|ers, &s;eldom are at the pains of talking upon univer&s;al topics, which require com|prehen&s;ive
<PB N="100" REF="108">
thought, or ab&s;tract rea&s;oning. The adventures of the little circle of their own acquaintance, or of &s;ome names of quality and fa&s;hion, make up their whole conver&s;ation. But it is too likely, that when we mention tho&s;e, we wi&s;h to de|pre&s;s them, in order to render our&s;elves more con&s;picuous; &s;candal mu&s;t therefore have fixed her throne at <HI>Bath,</HI> preferable to any other part of the kingdom. How|ever, tho' the&s;e endeavours could not to|tally &s;uppre&s;s this cu&s;tom among the fair, yet they gained him the friend&s;hip of &s;eve|ral ladies of di&s;tinction, who had &s;marted pretty &s;everely under the la&s;h of cen&s;ure. Among this number was the old duche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who conceived a particu|lar friend&s;hip for him, and which conti|nued during her life. She frequently con&s;ulted him in &s;everal concerns of a pri|vate nature. Her letting lea&s;es, building bridges, or forming canals, were often carried on under his guidance; but &s;he ad|vi&s;ed with him particularly in purcha&s;ing liveries for the footmen; a bu&s;ine&s;s to which &s;he thought his genius be&s;t a|dapted.

His wife laboured under a lingering di&s;order, which it was thought nothing but the Hot Wells could remove. The expences of living there &s;oon le&s;&s;ened the poor man's finances; his cloaths were &s;old, piece by piece, to pro|vide a temporary relief for his little family; and his appearance was at la&s;t &s;o &s;habby, that, from the number of holes in his coat and &s;tockings, <HI>Na&s;h</HI> gave him the name of doctor <HI>Cullender.</HI> Our beau, it &s;eems, was rude enough to make a je&s;t of poverty, tho' he had &s;en&s;ibility enough to relieve it. The poor clergyman combated his di&s;tre&s;&s;es with fortitude; and, in&s;tead of attempting to &s;olicit relief, endeavour|ed to conceal them. Upon a living of thirty pounds a year he endeavoured to maintain his wife and &s;ix children; but all his re&s;ources at la&s;t failed him, and nothing but famine was &s;een in the wretched family. The poor man's cir|cum&s;tances were at la&s;t communicated to
<PB N="107" REF="115">
<HI>Na&s;h</HI>; who, with his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, undertook to relieve him. On a &s;unday evening, at a public tea-drinking at <HI>Har|ri&s;on</HI>'s, he went about to collect a &s;ub&s;crip|tion, and began it him&s;elf, by giving five guineas. By this means two hundred guineas were collected in le&s;s than two hours, and the poor family rai&s;ed from the lowe&s;t de&s;pondence into affluence and felicity. A bounty &s;o unexpected, had a better influence even upon the woman's con&s;titution, than all that either the phy|&s;icians or the waters of <HI>Bath</HI> could produce, and &s;he recovered. But his good offices did not re&s;t here. He prevailed upon a no|bleman of his acquaintance, to pre&s;ent the Doctor with a living of an hundred and &s;ixty pounds a year, which made that hap|pine&s;s, he had before produced, in &s;ome mea&s;ure permanent.</P>
<P>In the &s;evere winter, which happened in the year 1739 his charity was great, u&s;eful, and exten&s;ive. He frequently, at that &s;ea&s;on of calamity, entered the hou&s;es of the poor, whom he thought too proud to beg, and generou&s;ly relieved

them. The colliers were at this time pe|culiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and in order to excite compa&s;&s;ion, a number of them yoak|ed them&s;elves to a waggon loaded with coals, and drew it into <HI>Bath,</HI> and pre&s;ent|ed it to Mr. <HI>Na&s;h.</HI> Their &s;cheme had the proper effect. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> procured them a &s;ub&s;cription, and gave ten guineas to|wards it him&s;elf. The weavers al&s;o &s;hared his bounty at that &s;ea&s;on. They came begging in a body into <HI>Bath,</HI> and he pro|vided a plentiful dinner for their entertain|ment, and gave each a week's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at going away.</P>
<P>There are few public charities to which he was not a &s;ub&s;criber, and many he prin|cipally contributed to &s;upport. Among others, Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ly,</HI> that &s;trange exam|ple of the mutability of fortune, and the inefficacy of our Laws, &s;hared his intere&s;t and bounty.

<P>WHEN I had the honour of con|ver&s;ing with thee at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, concerning that mo&s;t &s;in|gular &s;triking ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ley,</HI> whom I have known &s;ince he was about &s;ix years old, I being then employed by the late Lord Baron of <HI>Altham,</HI> his father, as his agent. From what I know of the affairs of that family, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ley</HI> is the legitimate &s;on of the late Lord Baron of <HI>Altham,</HI> and in con&s;equence thereof, is intitled to the ho|nours and e&s;tates of <HI>Angle&s;ey.</HI> Were I not well a&s;&s;ured of his right to tho&s;e honours and e&s;tates, I would not give countenance to his claim.&mdash;I well remember, that thou then made&s;t me a promi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;oliciting a &s;ub&s;cription, that was then be|gun at <HI>Tunbridge</HI>; but as that place was not within the limits of thy province, thou

<P>And now, my good friend, as the &s;ea&s;on is come on, and Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ley</HI> now at <HI>Bath,</HI> I beg leave to remind thee of that promi&s;e; and that thou wilt keep in full view the honour, the everla&s;ting honour, that will naturally redound to thee from thy bene|volence, and crown all the good actions of thy life.&mdash;I &s;ay, now in the vale of life, to relieve a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed young nobleman, to extricate &s;o immen&s;e an e&s;tate, from the hands of oppre&s;&s;ion; to do this, will fix &s;uch a ray of glory on thy memory, as will &s;peak forth thy prai&s;e to future ages.&mdash;This with great re&s;pect is the needful,</P>

<P><PB N="111" REF="119">Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> punctually kept his word with this gentleman; he began the &s;ub&s;crip|tion him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t liberality, and procured &s;uch a li&s;t of encouragers, as at once did honour to Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ly</HI>'s cau&s;e, and their own genero&s;ity. What a pity it was, that this money, which was given for the relief of indigence only, went to feed a &s;et of reptiles, who batten upon our weakne&s;s, mi&s;eries and vice.</P>
<P>It may not be known to the generality of my readers, that the la&s;t act of the co|medy, called <HI>E&s;op,</HI> which was added to the <HI>French</HI> plot of <HI>Bour&s;ault,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Van|burgh,</HI> was taken from a &s;tory told of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. He had in the early part of life made pro|po&s;als of marriage to mi&s;s <HI>V&mdash;,</HI> of <HI>D&mdash;</HI>; his affluence at that time, and the favour which he was in with the nobility, readi|ly induced the young lady's father to fa|vour his addre&s;&s;es. However, upon open|ing the affair to her&s;elf, &s;he candidly told him, her affections were placed upon ano|ther,
<PB N="112" REF="120">
and that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly com|ply. Tho' this an&s;wer &s;atisfied Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> it was by no means &s;ufficient to appea&s;e the father; and he peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon her obedience. Things were carri|ed to the la&s;t extremity; when Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> undertook to &s;ettle the affair; and de&s;iring his favoured rival to be &s;ent for, with his own hand pre&s;ented his mi&s;tre&s;s to him, together with a fortune equal to what her father intended to give her. Such an un|common in&s;tance of genero&s;ity had an in|&s;tant effect upon the &s;evere parent; he con|&s;idered &s;uch di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as a ju&s;t re|proach to his own mercenary di&s;po&s;ition, and took his daughter once more into fa|vour. I wi&s;h, for the dignity of hi&s;tory, that the &s;equel could be concealed, but the young lady ran away with her foot|man, before half a year was expired; and her hu&s;band died of grief.</P>
<P>In general, the benefactions of a gene|rous man are but ill be&s;towed. His heart &s;eldom gives him leave to examine the real di&s;tre&s;s of the object which &s;ues for pity;
<PB N="113" REF="121">
his good-nature takes the alarm too &s;oon, and he be&s;tows his fortune on only appa|rent wretchedne&s;s. The man naturally frugal, on the other hand, &s;eldom relieves, but when he does, his rea&s;on, and not his &s;en&s;ations, generally find out the object. Every in&s;tance of his bounty is therefore permanent, and bears witne&s;s to his bene|volence.</P>
<P>Of all the immen&s;e &s;ums which <HI>Na&s;h</HI> lavi&s;hed upon real or apparent wretched|ne&s;s, the effects, after a few years, &s;eem|ed to di&s;appear. His money was gene|rally given to &s;upport immediate want, or to relieve improvident indolence, and there|fore it vani&s;hed in an hour. Perhaps to|wards the clo&s;e of life, were he to look round on the thou&s;ands he had reliev|ed, he would find but few made hap|py, or fixed by his bounty in a &s;tate of thriving indu&s;try; it was enough for him, that he gave to tho&s;e that wanted; he never con&s;idered, that charity to &s;ome might impoveri&s;h him&s;elf without relieving them; he &s;eldom con&s;idered the merit or the in|du&s;try
<PB N="114" REF="122">
of the petitioner; or he rather fancied, that mi&s;ery was an excu&s;e for in|dolence and guilt. It was an u&s;ual &s;aying of his, when he went to beg for any per|&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, that they who could &s;toop to the meanne&s;s of &s;olicitation, mu&s;t certain|ly <HI>want</HI> the favour for which they peti|tioned.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore he gave away immen&s;e &s;ums of his own, and &s;till greater, which he procured from others. His way was, when any per&s;on was propo&s;ed to him as an object of charity, to go round with his hat fir&s;t among the nobility, ac|cording to their rank, and &s;o on, till he left &s;carce a &s;ingle per&s;on un&s;olicited. They who go thus about to beg for others, gene|rally find a plea&s;ure in the ta&s;k. They con|&s;ider, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, every benefaction they procure, as given by them&s;elves, and have at once the plea&s;ure of being liberal, without the &s;elf reproach of being profu&s;e.</P>
<P>But of all the in&s;tances of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s bounty, none does him more real honour,
<PB N="115" REF="123">
than the pains he took in e&s;tabli&s;hing an ho&s;pital at <HI>Bath,</HI> in which benefaction, however, Doctor <HI>Oliver</HI> had a great &s;hare. This was one of tho&s;e well guided charities, dictated by rea&s;on, and &s;upported by pru|dence. By this in&s;titution the di&s;ea&s;ed poor might recover health, when incapa|ble of receiving it in any other part of the kingdom. As the di&s;orders of the poor, who could expect to find relief at <HI>Bath,</HI> were mo&s;tly chronical, the expence of maintaining them there was found more than their pari&s;hes thought proper to afford. They therefore cho&s;e to &s;upport them in a continual &s;tate of infirmity, by a &s;mall allowance at home, rather than be at the charge of an expen&s;ive cure. An ho&s;pital therefore at <HI>Bath</HI> it was thought would be an a&s;&s;ylum, and a place of relief to tho&s;e di&s;a|bled creatures, and would, at the &s;ame time, give the phy&s;ician more thorough in&s;ight into the efficacy of the waters, from the regularity, with which &s;uch patients would be obliged to take them. The&s;e induce|ments therefore influenced Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> to promote a &s;ub&s;cription
<PB N="116" REF="124">
towards &s;uch a benefaction. The de&s;ign was &s;et on foot &s;o early as the year 1711, but not completed till the year 1742. This delay, which &s;eems &s;urprizing, was in fact owing to the want of a proper fund for carrying the work into execution. What I &s;aid above, of charity being the characteri&s;tic virtue of the pre&s;ent age, will be more fully evinced, by comparing the old and new &s;ub&s;criptions for this ho&s;|pital. The&s;e will &s;hew the difference be|tween ancient and modern benevolence. When I run my eye over the li&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;cribed in the year 1723, I find the &s;ub&s;cription in general &s;eldom ri&s;e above a guinea each per&s;on; &s;o that, at that time, with all their efforts, they were una|ble to rai&s;e four hundred pounds; but in a|bout twenty years after, each particular &s;ub|&s;cription was greatly encrea&s;ed, ten, twen|ty, thirty pounds, being the mo&s;t ordina|ry &s;ums then &s;ub&s;cribed, and they &s;oon rai&s;ed above two thou&s;and pounds for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="125">Thus chiefly by the means of Doctor <HI>Oliver</HI> and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> but not without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the good Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> who gave them the &s;tone for building and other benefactions, this ho&s;pital was erect|ed, and it is at pre&s;ent fitted up for the re|ception of one hundred and ten patients, the ca&s;es mo&s;tly paralytic or leprous. The following conditions are ob&s;erved previous to admittance.<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>"I. The ca&s;e of the patient mu&s;t be de|&s;cribed by &s;ome phy&s;ician, or per&s;on of &s;kill, in the neighbourhood of the place where the patient has re&s;ided for &s;ome time; and this de&s;cription, together with a certificate of the poverty of the patient, atte&s;ted by &s;ome per&s;ons of credit, mu&s;t be &s;ent in a letter po&s;t-paid, directed to the regi&s;ter of the <HI>General Ho&s;pital</HI> at <HI>Bath.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. After the patient's ca&s;e has been thus de&s;cribed, and &s;ent, he mu&s;t remain in his u&s;ual place or re&s;idence 'till he has notice of a vacancy, &s;ignified by a letter from the regi&s;ter.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="118" REF="126">III. Upon the receipt of &s;uch a letter, the patient mu&s;t &s;et forward for <HI>Bath,</HI> bringing with him this letter, the pari&s;h certificate duly executed, and allowed by two ju&s;tices, and three pounds caution-mo|ney, if from any part of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales</HI>; but if the patient comes from <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> then the caution-money, to be depo&s;ited before admi&s;&s;ion, is the &s;um of five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Soldiers may, in&s;tead of pari&s;h cer|tificates, bring a certificate from their commanding officers, &s;ignifying to what corps they belong, and that they &s;hall be received into the &s;ame corps, when di&s;|charged from the Ho&s;pital, in whatever condition they are. But it is nece&s;&s;ary, that their ca&s;es be de&s;cribed, and &s;ent pre|viou&s;ly, and that they bring with them three pounds caution-money.</ITEM>
</LIST><P><HI>Note,</HI> The intention of the caution-mo|ney is to defray the expences of returning the patients after they are di&s;charged from
<PB N="119" REF="127">
the Ho&s;pital, or of their burial in ca&s;e they die there. The remainder of the caution-money, after the&s;e expences are defrayed, will be returned to the per&s;on who made the depo&s;it."</P></Q></P>
<P>I am unwilling to leave this &s;ubject of his benevolence, becau&s;e it is a virtue in his character, which mu&s;t &s;tand almo&s;t &s;in|gle again&s;t an hundred follies; and it de|&s;erves the more to be in&s;i&s;ted on, becau&s;e it was large enough to outweigh them all. A man may be an hypocrite &s;afely in every other in&s;tance, but in charity; there are few who will buy the character of benevo|lence at the rate for which it mu&s;t be ac|quired. In &s;hort, the &s;ums he gave away were immen&s;e; and in old age, when at la&s;t grown too poor to give relief, <HI>he gave,</HI> as the poet has it, <HI>all he had, a tear</HI>; when incapable of relieving the agonies of the wretched, he attempted to relieve his own by a flood of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>From the ho&s;pital erected for the benefit of the poor, it is an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to the
<PB N="120" REF="128">
monuments erected by him in honour of the great. Upon the recovery of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by drinking the <HI>Bath</HI> waters, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> cau&s;ed a &s;mall obeli&s;k, thirty feet high, to be erected in a grove near the Abbey church, &s;ince called <HI>Orange Grove.</HI> This Prince's arms adorn the we&s;t &s;ide of the body of the pede&s;tal. The in|&s;cription is on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in the following words:

<P><PB N="121" REF="129">I find it a general cu&s;tom, at all Baths and Spaws, to erect monuments of this kind to the memory of every Prince, who has received benefit from the waters. <HI>Aix, Spau,</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> abound with in&s;criptions of this nature, apparently doing honour to the Prince, but in reality celebrating the efficacy of their &s;prings.

<P>In the year 1738, the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> came to <HI>Bath,</HI> who pre&s;ented Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> with a large gold enamelled &s;nuff-box; and upon his departure, <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> as king of <HI>Bath,</HI> erected an obeli&s;k in honour of this Prince, as he had before done for the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> This hand&s;ome memorial in ho|nour of that good-natured Prince is erected in <HI>Queen &s;quare.</HI> It is enclo&s;ed with a &s;tone balu&s;trade, and in the middle of every &s;ide there are large iron gates.

<P>Such a letter as this was what might naturally be expected from Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding the &s;eeming mode&s;ty towards the conclu&s;ion, the vanity of an applaud|ed writer bur&s;ts through every line of it. The difficulty of concealing his hand from the clerks at the Po&s;t-office, and the &s;o|licitude to have his name concealed, were marks of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own im|portance. It is probable, his hand was not &s;o very well known, nor his letters &s;o eagerly opened by the clerks of the Office, as he &s;eems always to think. But in all
<PB N="125" REF="133">
his letters, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Swift,</HI> there runs a &s;train of pride, as if the world talked of nothing but them&s;eves. <HI>Ala&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, in one of them, <HI>the day after I am dead, the &s;un will &s;hine as bright as the day before, and the world will be as merry as u&s;ual!</HI> Very &s;trange, that nei|ther an eclip&s;e nor an earthquake &s;hould follow the lo&s;s of a Poet!</P>
<P>The in&s;cription referred to in this letter, was the &s;ame which was afterwards en|graved on the obeli&s;k; and is as follows.<Q><P>In memory of honours be&s;tow'd,<LB>And in gratitude for benefits conferred in this city,<LB>By his Royal Highne&s;s<LB><HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI><LB>And his Royal Con&s;ort,<LB>In the Year 1738,<LB>This obeli&s;k is erected by<LB><HI>Richard Na&s;h,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P></Q></P>
<P>I dare venture to &s;ay, there was &s;carce a common-council-man in the corporation of

<P>About this period every &s;ea&s;on brought &s;ome new acce&s;&s;ion of honour to Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>; and the corporation now univer&s;ally found, that he was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for promot|ing the welfare of the city; &s;o that this year &s;eems to have been the meridian of his glory. About this time he arrived at &s;uch a pitch of authority, that I really believe <HI>Alex|ander</HI> was not greater at <HI>Per&s;epolis.</HI> The countenance he received from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the favour he was in with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the care&s;&s;es of the nobility, all con&s;pired to lift him to the utmo&s;t pitch of vanity. The exultation of a little mind, upon being admitted to the familiarity of the Great is inexpre&s;&s;ible. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had made him a a pre&s;ent of a very fine &s;nuff-box. Upon this &s;ome of the nobility thought it would be proper to give &s;nuff-boxes too;
<PB N="127" REF="135">
they were quickly imitated by the mid|dling gentry, and it &s;oon became the fa&s;hion to give Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;nuff-boxes.</P>
<P>To add to his honours, the corporation of <HI>Bath</HI> placed a full length &s;tatue of him, in the pump-room, between the bu&s;ts of <HI>Newton</HI> and <HI>Pope.</HI> It was upon this occa|&s;ion that the Earl of <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> wrote that &s;evere, but witty epigram; the la&s;t lines, of which were &s;o de&s;ervedly admired, and ran thus;
<Q><L>The &s;tatue placed, the bu&s;ts between,</L>
<L>Adds to the &s;atire &s;trength;</L>
<L><HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Wit</HI> are little &s;een,</L>
<L>But <HI>Folly</HI> at full length.</L></Q></P>
<P>The example of the corporation was followed by all his acquaintance, of infe|rior rank: He was treated in every re&s;pect like a great man; he had his levee, his flatterers, his buffoons, his good-natured creatures, and even his dedicators. A trifling ill &s;upported vanity was his foible, and while he received the homage of the
<PB N="128" REF="136">
vulgar, and enjoyed the familiarity of the great, he felt no pain for the unpromi|&s;ing view of poverty that lay before him; he enjoyed the world as it went, and drew upon content for the deficiencies of fortune. If a cringing wretch called him his Honour, he was plea&s;ed; internally con&s;cious, that he had the ju&s;te&s;t preten&s;ions to the title. If a beggar called him my Lord, he was happy, and generally &s;ent the flatterer off happy too. I have known him, in <HI>London,</HI> wait a whole day at a window in the <HI>Smyrna</HI> coffee-hou&s;e, in order to receive a bow from the Prince, or the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as they pa&s;&s;ed by where he was &s;tanding; and he would then look round upon the company for admiration and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But perhaps the reader de&s;ires to know, who could be low enough to flatter a man, who him&s;elf lived in &s;ome mea&s;ure by de|pendance. Hundreds are ready upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions. The very needy are almo&s;t ever flatterers. A man in wretched circum|&s;tances forgets his own value, and feels no
<PB N="129" REF="137">
pain in giving up &s;uperiority to every clai|mant. The very vain are ever flatterers; as they find it nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of all their arts, to keep company with &s;uch as are &s;uperior to them&s;elves. But particu|larly the prodigal are prone to adulation, in order to open new &s;upplies for their ex|travagance. The poor, the vain, and the extravagant, are chiefly addicted to this vice; and &s;uch hung upon his good nature. When the&s;e three characters are found united in one per&s;on, the compo&s;ition ge|nerally becomes a great man's favourite. It was not difficult to collect &s;uch a groupe in a city, that was the center of plea&s;ure. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> had them of all &s;izes, from the half pay captain in laced cloaths, to the humble boot-catcher at the <HI>Bear.</HI></P>

<P>But &s;ince I have mentioned this fel|low's book, I cannot repre&s;s an impul&s;e to give an extract from it, however fo|reign from my &s;ubject. I take the follow|ing picture to be a perfectly humorous de&s;cription of artful knavery affecting ig|norance on one hand, and ru&s;tic &s;impli|city pretending to great wi&s;dom and &s;a|gacity on the other. It is an account of the manner in which countrymen are de|ceived by gamblers, at a game called Pricking in the Belt, or the Old Nob. This is a leathern &s;trop, folded up double, and then laid upon a table; if the per&s;on who plays with a bodkin pricks into the loop of the belt he wins; if otherwi&s;e, he lo&s;es.

thought witty, makes but a very bad bar|gain.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s <HI>Na&s;h</HI> &s;ometimes met with led him on, when late in life, to mi&s;take his true character. He was really agreeable, but he cho&s;e to be thought a wit. He therefore indulged his inclination, and never mattered how rude he was, provi|ded he was thought comical. He thus got the applau&s;e he &s;ought for, but too often found enemies, where he lea&s;t expec|ted to find them. Of all the je&s;ts record|ed of him, I &s;carce find one that is not marked with petulance; he &s;aid whatever came uppermo&s;t, and in the number of his remarks it might naturally be expected that &s;ome were worth repeating; he threw of|ten, and &s;ometimes had a lucky ca&s;t.</P>
<P>In a life of almo&s;t ninety years, &s;pent in the very point of public view, it is not &s;trange, that five or &s;ix &s;prightly things of his have been collected, particularly as he took every opportunity of repeating them him&s;elf. His u&s;ual way, when he thought
<PB N="148" REF="156">
he &s;aid any thing clever, was to &s;trengthen it with an oath, and to make up its want of &s;entiment by a&s;&s;everation and grimace. For many years he thus entertained the company at the coffee-hou&s;e with old &s;tories, in which he always made him&s;elf the prin|cipal character. Strangers liked this well enough; but they who were u&s;ed to his conver&s;ation found it in&s;upportable. One &s;tory brought on another, and each came in the &s;ame order that it had the day pre|ceding. But this cu&s;tom may be rather a&s;cribed to the peculiarity of age, than a peculiarity of character; it &s;eldom happens, that old men allure, at lea&s;t by novelty; age that &s;hrivels the body contracts the under&s;tanding; in&s;tead of exploring new regions, they re&s;t &s;atisfied in the old, and walk round the circle of their former di&s;coveries. His manner of telling a &s;tory, however, was not di&s;plea&s;ing, but few of tho&s;e he told are worth tran&s;cribing. In|deed it is the manner, which places the the whole difference between the wit of the vulgar, and of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume the name of the polite; one, has in general as much
<PB N="149" REF="157">
good &s;en&s;e as the other; a &s;tory tran&s;cri|bed from the one, will be as entertaining as that copied from the other; but in con|ver&s;ation, the manner will give charms even to &s;tupidity. The following is the &s;tory which he mo&s;t frequently told, and pretty much in the&s;e words. Suppo&s;e the company to be talking of a <HI>German</HI> war, or <HI>Elizabeth Canning,</HI> he would begin thus.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll tell you &s;omething to that purpo&s;e, that I fancy will make you laugh. A covetous old par&s;on, as rich as the De|vil, &s;craped a fre&s;h acquaintance with me &s;everal years ago at <HI>Bath.</HI> I knew him when he and I were &s;tudents at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where we both &s;tudied damnationly hard, but that's neither here nor there. Well. Very well. I entertained him at my hou&s;e in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Court.</HI> (No, my hou&s;e in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Court</HI> was not built then) but I entertained him with all that the city could afford; the rooms, the mu&s;ic, and every thing in the world. Upon his leav|ing <HI>Bath,</HI> he pre&s;&s;ed me very hard to re|turn the vi&s;it; and de&s;ired me to let him
<PB N="150" REF="158">
have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me at his hou&s;e in <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> About &s;ix months after, I happened to be in that neigh|bourhood, and was re&s;olved to &s;ee my old friend, from whom I expected a very warm reception. Well: I knocks at his door, when an old queer crea|ture of a maid, came to the door, and denied him. I &s;u&s;pected, how|ever, that he was at home; and going into the parlour, what &s;hould I &s;ee, but the Par&s;on's legs up the chim|ney, where he had thru&s;t him&s;elf to a|void entertaining me. This was very well. My dear, &s;ays I to the maid, it is very cold, extreme cold indeed, and I am afraid I have got a touch of my ague, light me the fire, if you plea&s;e. La, &s;ir, &s;ays the maid, who was a mode&s;t creature to be &s;ure, the chimney &s;mokes mon&s;trou&s;ly; you could not bear the room for three minutes together. By the greate&s;t good luck there was a bun|dle of &s;traw in the hearth, and I called for a candle. The candle came. Well,
<PB N="151" REF="159">
good woman, &s;ays I, &s;ince you won't light me a fire, I'll light one for my&s;elf, and in a moment the &s;traw was all in a blaze. This quickly unkennelled the old fox; there he &s;tood in an old ru&s;ty night gown, ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, and looking like&mdash;a&mdash;hem&mdash;egad."</Q></P>
<P>He u&s;ed to tell &s;urprizing &s;tories of his activity when young.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here I &s;tand, gentlemen, that could once leap forty two feet upon level ground, at three &s;tanding jumps, backward or forward. One, two, three, dart like an arrow out of a bow. But I am old now. I remember I once leaped for three hundred guineas with Count <HI>Klop&s;tock,</HI> the great leaper, leaping-ma&s;ter to the Prince of <HI>Pa&s;&s;au</HI>; you mu&s;t all have heard of him. Fir&s;t he began with the running jump, and a mo&s;t dam|nable bounce it was, that's certain: Every body concluded that he had the match hollow; when only taking off my hat, &s;tripping off neither coat, &s;hoes,

nor &s;tockings, mind me, I fetches a run, and went beyond him one foot, three inches and three quarters mea&s;ured, upon my &s;oul, by Captain <HI>Pately</HI>'s own &s;tand|ard."</Q></P>
<P>But in this torrent of in&s;ipidity, there &s;ometimes were found very &s;evere &s;atire, &s;trokes of true wit, and lines of humour, <HI>cum fluerent lutulentus, &amp;c.</HI> He rallied very &s;ucce&s;sfully, for he never felt another's joke; and drove home his own without pity. With his &s;uperiors he was familiar and blunt, the inferiority of his &s;tation &s;ecured him from their re&s;entment; but the &s;ame bluntne&s;s which they laughed at, was by his equals regarded as in&s;olence. Something like a familiar boot-catcher at an inn, a gentleman would bear that joke from him, for which a brother boot-catcher would knock him down.</P>
<P>Among other &s;tories of <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s telling, I remember one, which I the more chear|fully repeat, as it tends to correct a piece of impertinence that reigns in almo&s;t

every country a&s;&s;embly. The principal inhabitants of a market-town, at a great di&s;tance from the capital, in order to en|courage that harmony which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ociety, and to promote a mu|tual intercour&s;e between the &s;exes, &s;o de|&s;irable to both, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for all, had e&s;tabli&s;hed a monthly a&s;&s;embly in the Town Hall, which was conducted with &s;uch decency, decorum and politene&s;s, that it drew the attention of the gentlemen and ladies in the neighbourhood; and a noble|man and his family continually honour|ed them with their pre&s;ence. This natu|rally drew others, and in time the room was crouded with, what the world calls, good company, and the a&s;&s;embly pro&s;per|ed, till &s;ome of the new admitted ladies took it into their heads, that the trade&s;|mens daughters were unworthy of their notice, and therefore refus'd to join hands with them in the dance. This was com|plained of by the town ladies, and that complaint was re&s;ented by the country gentlemen, who, more pert than wi&s;e, publickly adverti&s;ed, that they would not
<PB N="154" REF="162">
dance with trade&s;mens daughters. This the mo&s;t eminent trade&s;men con&s;idered as an in&s;ult on them&s;elves, and being men of worth, and able to live independently, they in return adverti&s;ed that they would give no credit out of their town, and de&s;ired all others to di&s;charge their accounts. A general unea&s;ine&s;s en&s;ued; &s;ome writs were actually i&s;&s;ued out, and much di&s;tre&s;s would have happened, had not my Lord, who &s;ided with no party, kindly interfe|red and compo&s;ed the difference. The a&s;&s;embly however was ruined, and the families I am told are not friends yet, tho' this affair happened thirty years ago.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing deba&s;es human nature &s;o much as pride.</HI>&mdash;This <HI>Na&s;h</HI> knew, and endeavour|ed to &s;tifle every emotion of it at <HI>Bath.</HI> When he ob&s;erved any ladies &s;o extremely delicate and proud of a pedigree, as to only touch the back of an inferior's hand in the dance, he always called to order, and de&s;ired them to leave the room, or behave with common decency; and when any Ladies and Gentlemen drew off, after
<PB N="155" REF="163">
they had gone down a dance, without &s;tanding up till the dance was fini&s;hed, he made up to them, and after a&s;king whe|ther they had done dancing, told them, they &s;hould dance no more unle&s;s they &s;tood up for the re&s;t; and on the&s;e occa|&s;ions he always was as good as his word.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h,</HI> tho' no great wit, had the art of &s;ometimes &s;aying rude things with decen|cy, and rendering them plea&s;ing by an uncommon turn.&mdash;But mo&s;t of the good things attributed to him, which have found their way into the je&s;t books, are no better than puns; the &s;marte&s;t things I have &s;een are again&s;t him. One day in the grove, he joined &s;ome ladies, and a&s;king one of them, who was crooked, whence &s;he came? She replied, &s;trait from <HI>London.</HI> Confound me, madam, &s;aid he, then you mu&s;t have been damnably warpt by the way.</P>
<P>She &s;oon, however, had ample revenge. Sitting the following evening in one of the rooms, he once more joined her company,
<PB N="156" REF="164">
and with a &s;neer and a bow, a&s;ked her, if &s;he knew her Catechi&s;m, and could tell the name of <HI>Tobit</HI>'s dog? His name, Sir, was <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> replied the lady, and an impu|dent dog be was. This &s;tory is told in a celebrated romance; I only repeat it here to have an opportunity of ob&s;erving, that it actually happened.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Anne</HI> once a&s;ked him, why he would not accept of knighthood? To which he replied, le&s;t Sir <HI>William Read,</HI> the mountebank, who had been ju&s;t knighted, &s;hould call him brother.</P>
<P>An hou&s;e in <HI>Bath</HI> was &s;aid to be haunted by the Devil, and a great noi&s;e was made about it, when <HI>Na&s;h</HI> going to the Mini&s;ter of St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, intreated him to drive the Devil out of <HI>Bath</HI> for ever, if it were only to oblige the ladies.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h</HI> u&s;ed &s;ometimes to vi&s;it the great Doctor <HI>Clarke.</HI> The Doctor was one day conver&s;ing with <HI>Locke,</HI> and two or three more of his learned and intimate compa|nions,
<PB N="157" REF="165">
with that freedom, gaiety and chear|fulne&s;s, which is ever the re&s;ult of inno|cence. In the mid&s;t of their mirth and laughter, the Doctor, looking from the window, &s;aw <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s chariot &s;top at the door. Boys, boys, cried the philo&s;opher, to his friends, let us now be wi&s;e, for here is a fool coming.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h</HI> was one day complaining in the following manner to the Earl of <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> of his bad luck at play. Would you think it, my Lord, that damned bitch fortune, no later than la&s;t night, tricked me out of 500. Is it not &s;urprizing, continued he, that my luck &s;hould never turn, that I &s;hould thus eternally be mauled? I don't wonder at your lo&s;ing money <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> &s;ays his lord&s;hip, but all the world is &s;urprized where you get it to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Cheney</HI> once, when <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was ill, drew up a pre&s;cription for him, which was &s;ent in accordingly. The next day the Doctor coming to &s;ee his patient, found him up and well; upon which he a&s;ked,
<PB N="158" REF="166">
if he had followed his pre&s;cription? Fol|lowed your pre&s;cription, cried <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> No.&mdash;Egad, if I had, I &s;hould have broke my neck, for I flung it out of the two pair of &s;tairs window.</P>
<P>It would have been well, had he confined him&s;elf to &s;uch &s;allies; but as he grew old he grew in&s;olent, and &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, in&s;en&s;ible of the pain his attempts to be a wit gave others. Upon a&s;king a lady to dance a minuet; if &s;he refu&s;ed, he would often demand, if &s;he had got bandy legs. He would attempt to ridicule natural de|fects; he forgot the deference due to birth and quality, and mi&s;took the manner of &s;ettling rank and precedence upon many occa&s;ions. He now &s;eemed no longer fa&s;hionable among the pre&s;ent race of gentry, he grew peevi&s;h and fretful, and they who only &s;aw the remnant of a man, &s;everely returned that laughter upon him, which he had once lavi&s;hed upon others.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="167">Poor <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was no longer the gay, thoughtle&s;s, idly indu&s;trious creature he once was; he now forgot how to &s;upply new modes of entertainment, and became too rigid, to wind with ea&s;e through the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of fa&s;hion. The evening of his life began to grow cloudy. His for|tune was gone, and nothing but poverty lay in pro&s;pect. To embitter his hopes, he found him&s;elf abandoned by the great, whom he had long endeavoured to &s;erve; and was obliged to fly to tho&s;e of humbler &s;tations for protection, whom he once af|fected to de&s;pi&s;e. He now began to want that charity, which he had never refu&s;ed to any; and to find, that a life of di&s;&s;ipa|tion and gaiety, is ever terminated by mi|&s;ery and regret.</P>
<P>Even his place of ma&s;ter of the cere|monies (if I can tru&s;t the papers he has left behind him) was &s;ought after. I would willingly be tender of any living reputati|on; but the&s;e papers accu&s;e Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> of endeavouring to &s;upplant him. He has

<P><PB N="164" REF="172">Here <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> if I may be permitted the u&s;e of a polite and fa&s;hionable phra&s;e, was humm'd; but he experienced &s;uch rubs as the&s;e, and a thou&s;and other mortifications every day. He found po|verty now denied him the indulgence not only of his favourite follies, but of his favourite virtues. The poor now &s;olicited him in vain; he was him|&s;elf a more pitiable object than they. The child of the public &s;eldom has a friend, and he who once exerci&s;ed his wit at the expence of others, mu&s;t naturally have ene|mies. Exa&s;perated at la&s;t to the highe&s;t degree, an unaccountable whim &s;truck him; poor <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was re&s;olved to become an au|thor; he, who in the vigour of manhood, was incapable of the ta&s;k, now at the im|potent age of eighty-&s;ix, was determined to write his own hi&s;tory! from the many &s;pecimens already given of his &s;tyle, the reader will not much regret that the hi&s;to|rian was interrupted in his de&s;ign. Yet as <HI>Montaigne</HI> ob&s;erves, as the adventures

of an infant, if an infant could inform us of them, would be plea&s;ing; &s;o the life of a Beau, if a beau could write, would certainly &s;erve to regale curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Whether he really intended to put this de&s;ign in execution, or did it only to alarm the nobility, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is, that his friends went about collecting &s;ub&s;criptions for the work, and he received &s;everal en|couragements from &s;uch as were willing to be politely charitable. It was thought by many, that this hi&s;tory would reveal the intrigues of a whole age; that he had numberle&s;s &s;ecrets to di&s;clo&s;e; but they ne|ver con&s;idered, that per&s;ons of public cha|racter, like him, were the mo&s;t unlikely in the world to be made partakers of tho&s;e &s;ecrets which people de&s;ired the public &s;hould not know. In fact, he had few &s;e|crets to di&s;cover, and tho&s;e he had, are now buried with him in the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">He was now pa&s;t the power of giving or receiving plea&s;ure, for he was poor, old and peevi&s;h; yet &s;till he was incapable of turning from his former manner of life to pur&s;ue happine&s;s. The old man endea|voured to practi&s;e the follies of the boy, he &s;purred on his jaded pa&s;&s;ions after every trifle of the day; tottering with age he would be ever an unwelcome gue&s;t in the a&s;&s;emblies of the youthful and gay; and he &s;eemed willing to find lo&s;t appetite among tho&s;e &s;cenes where he was once young.</P>
<P>An old man thus &s;triving after plea&s;ure is indeed an object of pity; but a man at once old and poor, running on in this pur|&s;uit, might excite a&s;toni&s;hment. To &s;ee a Being both by fortune and con&s;tituti|on rendered incapable of enjoyment, &s;till haunting tho&s;e plea&s;ures he was no longer to &s;hare in; to &s;ee one of almo&s;t ninety &s;et|tling the fa&s;hion of a lady's cap, or a&s;&s;ign|ing her place in a country dance; to &s;ee him unmindful of his own reverend

<P>But he was not permitted to run on thus without &s;evere and repeated reproof. The clergy &s;ent him frequent calls to reforma|tion; but the a&s;perity of their advice in general abated its intended effects; they threatened him with fire and brim&s;tone, for what he had long been taught to con|&s;ider as foibles, and not vices; &s;o like a de&s;perated debtor, he did not care to &s;ettle an account, that, upon the fir&s;t in&s;pection, he found him&s;elf utterly unable to pay. Thus begins one of his monitors.<Q REND="inline"><P>"THIS admonition comes from your friend, and one that has your inte|re&s;t deeply at heart: It comes on a de&s;ign altogether important, and of no le&s;s con|&s;equence

God as a corrupt carca&s;e that lies putrefy|ing in the church-yard. You are as far from doing your duty, or endeavouring after &s;alvation, or re&s;toring your&s;elf to the divine favour, as a heap of dry bones nail|ed up in a coffin is from vigour and acti|vity.&mdash;Think, Sir, I conjure you, think upon this, if you have any inclination to e&s;cape the fire that will never be quench|ed. Would you be re&s;cued from the fury and fierce anger of God? Would you be delivered from weeping and wailing, and ince&s;&s;ant gna&s;hing of teeth? &s;ure you would! But be certain, that this will never be done by amu&s;ements, which at be&s;t are trifling and impertinent; and for that, if for no other rea&s;on, fooli&s;h and &s;inful. 'Tis by &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s; 'tis by retirement and mourning, you mu&s;t accompli&s;h this great and de&s;ira|ble deliverance. You mu&s;t not appear at the head of every &s;illy diver&s;ion, you mu&s;t enter into your clo&s;et, and &s;hut the door; commune with your own heart, and &s;earch out its defects. The pride of life, and all its &s;uperfluity of follies mu&s;t be put away. You mu&s;t make ha&s;te, and delay not to

Your example, and your projects have been extremely <HI>prejudicial</HI>; I wi&s;h I could not &s;ay, <HI>fatal</HI> and <HI>de&s;tructive</HI> to many: For this there is no amends but an alteration of your conduct, as &s;ignal and remarkable as your <HI>per&s;on</HI> and <HI>name.</HI>"</P>
<P>"If you do not by this method remedy in &s;ome degree the evils that you have &s;ent abroad, and prevent the mi&s;chievous con|&s;equences that may en&s;ue&mdash;wretched will you be, wretched above all men, to eternity. The blood of &s;ouls will be laid to your charge; God's jealou&s;y, like a con&s;uming flame, will &s;moke again&s;t you; as you your|&s;elf will &s;ee in that day, when the moun|tains &s;hall quake, and the hills melt, and the earth be burnt up at his pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Once more then I exhort you as a friend; I be&s;eech you as a brother; I charge you as a me&s;&s;enger from God, in his own mo&s;t &s;olemn words;

<P>"Perhaps you may be di&s;po&s;ed to con|temn this, and its &s;erious purport; or to recommend it to your companions as a &s;ubject for raillery&mdash;Yet let me tell you be|fore-hand, that for this, as well as for other things, God will bring you to judg|ment. He &s;ees me now I write: He will ob&s;erve you while you read. He notes down my words; he will al&s;o note down your con&s;equent procedure. Not then upon me, not upon me; but upon your own &s;oul, will the neglecting or de&s;pi&s;ing my &s;ayings turn.

<P>Such repeated admonitions as the&s;e &s;erved to &s;ting, without reforming him; they made him moro&s;e, but not pious. The do&s;e was too &s;trong for the patient to bear. He &s;hould have been met with &s;miles, and allured into reformation, if indeed he was
<PB N="172" REF="180">
criminal. But in the name of piety, what was there criminal in his conduct; he had long been taught to con&s;ider his trifling profe&s;&s;ion as a very &s;erious and important bu&s;ine&s;s. He went through his office with great gravity, &s;olemnity, and care; why then denounce peculiar torments again&s;t a poor harmle&s;s creature, who did a thou&s;and good things, and who&s;e greate&s;t vice was vanity. He de&s;erved ridicule, indeed, and he found it, but &s;carce a &s;ingle action of his life, except one, de&s;erves the a&s;perity of reproach.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee a variety of cau&s;es concurred to embitter his departing life. The weakne&s;s and infirmities of exhau&s;ted nature, the ad|monitions of the grave, who aggravated his follies into vices; the ingratitude of his dependants, who formerly flattered his for|tunes; but particularly the contempt of the great, who quite forgot him in his wants; all the&s;e hung upon his &s;pirits and &s;oured his temper, and the poor man of plea&s;ure might have terminated his life very tragically, had not the corporation of
<PB N="173" REF="181">
<HI>Bath</HI> charitably re&s;olved to grant him ten guineas the fir&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> of every month. This bounty &s;erved to keep him from ac|tual nece&s;&s;ity, tho' far too trifling, to enable him to &s;upport the character of a gentle|man. Habit, and not nature, makes al|mo&s;t all our wants; and he who had been accu&s;tomed in the early parts of life to af|fluence and prodigality, when reduced to an hundred and twenty-&s;ix pounds a year, mu&s;t pine in actual indigence.</P>
<P>In this variety of unea&s;ine&s;s his health began to fail. He had received from na|ture a robu&s;t and happy con&s;titution, that was &s;carce even to be impaired by intem|perance. He even pretended, among his friends, that he never followed a &s;ingle pre|&s;cription in his life; however, in this he was one day detected on the parade; for boa&s;ting there of his contempt and utter difu&s;e of medicine, unluckily the water of two bli&s;ters, which Dr. <HI>Oliver</HI> had pre|&s;cribed, and which he then had upon each leg, ouzed through his &s;tockings, and be|trayed him. His aver&s;ion to phy&s;ic, how|ever,
<PB N="174" REF="182">
was frequently a topic of raillery be|tween him and Doctor <HI>Cheney,</HI> who was a man of &s;ome wit and breeding. When <HI>Cheney</HI> recommended his vegetable diet, <HI>Na&s;h</HI> would &s;wear, that his de&s;ign was to &s;end half the world grazing like <HI>Ne|buchadnezzar.</HI> Ay, <HI>Cheney</HI> would reply, <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was never &s;uch an infidel as thou art. It was but la&s;t week, gentle|men, that I attended this fellow in a fit of &s;ickne&s;s; there I found him rolling up his eyes to heaven, and crying for mercy; he would then &s;wallow my drugs like brea&s;t-milk, yet you now hear him, how the old dog bla&s;phemes the faculty. What <HI>Cheney</HI> &s;aid in je&s;t was true, he feared the approaches of death more than the genera|lity of mankind, and was generally very de|vout while it threatened him. Tho' he was &s;omewhat the libertine in action, none believed or trembled more than he; for a mind neither &s;chooled by philo&s;ophy, nor encouraged by con&s;cious innocence, is ever timid at the appearance of dan|ger.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183">For &s;ome time before his decea&s;e nature gave warning of his approaching di&s;&s;olu|tion. The worn machine had run it&s;elf down to an utter impo&s;&s;ibility of repair; he &s;aw, that he mu&s;t die, and &s;huddered at the thought. His virtues were not of the great, but the amiable kind; &s;o that for|titude was not among the number. Anxi|ous, timid, his thoughts &s;till hanging on a receding world, he de&s;ired to enjoy a little longer that life, the mi&s;eries of which he had experienced &s;o long. The poor un&s;ucce&s;sful game&s;ter hu&s;banded the wa&s;t|ing moments, with an encrea&s;ed de&s;ire to-continue the game, and to the la&s;t eagerly wi&s;hed for one yet more happy throw. He died at his hou&s;e in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>court, Bath,</HI> on the 3d of <HI>February,</HI> 1761, aged eighty-&s;even years, three months, and &s;ome days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of his age, which contradicts that given us by Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> was copied from Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s own hand-writing, by <HI>George Scott,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> from a book in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Charles Morgan,</HI> at his coffee-hou&s;e at <HI>Bath.</HI></NOTE></P>

The ma&s;ters of the a&s;&s;embly-rooms fol|lowed as chief mourners; the beadles of that ho&s;pital, which he had contribu|ted &s;o largely to endow, went next, and la&s;t of all, the poor patients them&s;elves,
<PB N="178" REF="186">
the lame, the emaciated, and the feeble, followed their old benefactor to his grave, &s;hedding unfeigned tears, and lamenting them&s;elves in him.</P>
<P>The crowd was &s;o great, that not only the &s;treets were filled, but, as one of the journals in a <HI>Rant</HI> expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"even the tops of the hou&s;es were covered with &s;pectators, each thought the occa&s;ion af|fected them&s;elves mo&s;t; as when a real King dies, they a&s;ked each other, <HI>where &s;hall we find &s;uch another</HI>; &s;orrow &s;ate up|on every face, and even children li&s;ped that their Sovereign was no more. The awfulne&s;s of the &s;olemnity made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants.

<P>Our deepe&s;t &s;olemnities have &s;omething truly ridiculous in them: there is &s;ome|what ludicrous in the folly of hi&s;torians, who thus declaim upon the death of
<PB N="179" REF="187">
Kings and Princes, as if there was any thing di&s;mal, or any thing unu&s;ual in it. <Q REND="inline">"For my part, &s;ays Poggi the Florentine, I can no more grieve for another's death than I could for my own. I have ever regarded death as a very trifling affair; nor can black &s;taves, long cloaks, or mourning coaches, in the lea&s;t influence my &s;pirits. Let us live here as long, and as merrily as we can, and when we mu&s;t die, why let us die merrily too, but die &s;o as to be happy."</Q></P>
<P>The few things he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of were left to his relations. A &s;mall li|brary of well cho&s;en books, &s;ome trinkets and pictures, were his only inheritance. Among the latter were a gold box, given by the late Counte&s;s of <HI>Burlington,</HI> with Lady <HI>Eu&s;ton</HI>'s picture in the lid. An agate etui, with a diamond on the top, by the Prince&s;s Dowager of <HI>Wales,</HI> and &s;ome other things of no great value. The rings, watches, and pictures, which he former|ly received from others, would have come to a con&s;iderable amount; but the&s;e his ne|ce&s;&s;ities had obliged him to di&s;po&s;e of: Some
<PB N="180" REF="188">
family pictures, however, remained, which were &s;old by adverti&s;ement, for five gui|neas each, after Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s decea&s;e.</P>
<P>It was natural to expect, that the death of a per&s;on &s;o long in the eye of the pub|lic, mu&s;t have produced a de&s;ire in &s;everal to delineate his character, or deplore his lo&s;s. He was &s;carce dead, when the pub|lic papers were filled with elegies, groans and characters; and before he was buried, there were epitaphs ready made to in&s;cribe on his &s;tone. I remember one of tho&s;e character writers, and a very grave one too, after ob&s;erving, ala&s;s! that <HI>Richard Na&s;h,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was no more, went on to a&s;&s;ure us, that he was <HI>&s;agacious, debonair, and comode</HI>; and concluded with gravely de|claring, <HI>that impotent po&s;terity would in vain fumble to produce his fellow.</HI> Another, e|qually &s;orrowful, gave us to know, <HI>that he was indeed a man</HI>; an a&s;&s;ertion, which I fancy none will be &s;o hardy as to contra|dict. But the merrie&s;t of all the lamen|tations made upon this occa&s;ion was, that where he is called, <HI>A con&s;tellation of the heavenly &s;phere.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="189">One thing, however, is common almo&s;t with each of them, and that is, that <HI>Venus, Cupid,</HI> and the <HI>Graces,</HI> are commanded to weep; and that <HI>Bath</HI> &s;hall never find &s;uch another.</P>
<P>But tho' he was &s;atirized with the prai&s;es of tho&s;e, yet there were &s;ome of real abilities, who undertook to do ju&s;tice to his character, to prai&s;e him for his virtues, and acknowledge his faults. I need &s;carcely mention, that Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> and Doctor <HI>King</HI> are of this number. They had honoured him with their friend&s;hip while living, and undertook to honour his me|mory when dead. As the reader may chu&s;e to compare their efforts upon the &s;ame &s;ub|ject, I have &s;ubjoined them, and perhaps many will find in either enough, upon &s;o unimportant a &s;ubject as Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s life, to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity. The fir&s;t publi&s;hed. was that by Doctor <HI>Oliver,</HI> written with much good &s;en&s;e, and &s;till more good na|ture.

<P><PB N="198" REF="206">Whatever might have been ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s &s;uperiority as a go|vernor, at lea&s;t it may be &s;aid, that few contemporary kings have met with &s;uch able panegyri&s;ts. The former enumerates all his good qualities with tenderne&s;s; and the latter enforces them with impetuo&s;ity. They both &s;eem to have loved him, and honourably paid his remains the la&s;t debt of friend&s;hip. But a cool biographer, un|bia&s;&s;ed by re&s;entment or regard, will pro|bably find nothing in the man either truly great, or &s;trongly vicious. His virtues were all amiable, and more adapted to procure friends than admirers, they were more ca|pable of rai&s;ing love than e&s;teem. He was naturally endued with good &s;en&s;e; but by having been long accu&s;tomed to pur&s;ue tri|fles, his mind &s;hrunk to the &s;ize of the little objects on which it was employed. His genero&s;ity was boundle&s;s, becau&s;e his tenderne&s;s and his vanity were in equal pro|portion; the one impelling him to relieve mi&s;ery, and the other to make his bene|factions known. In all his actions, how|ever
<PB N="199" REF="207">
virtuous, he was guided by &s;en&s;ation, and not by rea&s;on; &s;o that the uppermo&s;t pa&s;&s;ion was ever &s;ure to prevail. His be|ing con&s;tantly in company had made him an ea&s;y tho' not a polite companion. He cho&s;e to be thought rather an odd fellow, than a well-bred man; perhaps that mix|ture of re&s;pect and ridicule, with which his mock royalty was treated, fir&s;t in&s;pired him with this re&s;olution. The founda|tions of his empire were laid in vicious compliance, the continuance of his reign was &s;upported by a virtuous impartiality. In the beginning of his authority, he in reality obeyed tho&s;e whom he pretended to govern; towards the end, he attempted to extort a real obedience from his &s;ub|jects, and &s;upported his right by pre&s;crip|tion. Like a monarch <HI>Tacitus</HI> talks of; they complied with him at fir&s;t becau&s;e they loved, they obeyed at la&s;t becau&s;e they feared him. He often led the rich into new follies, in order to promote the happine&s;s of the poor, and &s;erved the one at the expence of the other. Whatever his vices were, they were of u&s;e to &s;ociety;
<PB N="200" REF="208">
and this neither Petronius, nor Apicius, nor Tigellius, nor any other profe&s;&s;ed vo|luptuary, could &s;ay. To &s;et him up, as &s;ome do, for a pattern of imitation, is wrong, &s;ince all his virtues received a tinc|ture from the neighbouring folly; to de|nounce peculiar judgments again&s;t him, is equally unju&s;t, as his faults rai&s;e rather our mirth than our dete&s;tation. He was fitted for the &s;tation in which fortune placed him. It required no great abilities to fill it, and few of great abilities, but would have di&s;dained the employment. He led a life of vanity, and long mi&s;took it for happine&s;s. Unfortunately he was taught at la&s;t to know, that a man of plea&s;ure leads the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant life in the world.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="201" REF="209">
<HEAD><HI>A Letter from Mr.</HI> *** <HI>in</HI> Tunbridge, <HI>to Lord &mdash; in</HI> London; <HI>found among the Papers of Mr.</HI> Na&s;h, <HI>and prepared by him for the pre&s;s.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I fore&s;aw has arrived, poor <HI>Jenners,</HI> after lo&s;ing all his fortune, has &s;hot him&s;elf through the head. His lo&s;&s;es to <HI>Bland</HI> were con&s;iderable, and his playing &s;oon after with <HI>Spedding</HI> contri|buted to ha&s;ten his ruin. No man was ever more enamour'd of play, or under|&s;tood it le&s;s. At whatever game he ven|tured his money, he was mo&s;t u&s;ually the dupe, and &s;till fooli&s;hly attributed to his bad luck, tho&s;e misfortunes that entirely proceeded from his want of judgment.</P>
<P>After finding that he had brought on him&s;elf irreparable indigence and contempt, his temper, formerly &s;o &s;prightly, began to grow gloomy and unequal; he grew more fond of &s;olitude, and more liable to
<PB N="202" REF="210">
take offence at &s;uppo&s;ed injuries; in &s;hort, for a week before he &s;hot him&s;elf, his friends were of opinion, that he medita|ted &s;ome &s;uch horrid de&s;ign. He was found in his chamber fallen on the floor, the bullet having glanced on the bone, and lodged behind his right eye.</P>
<P>You remember my Lord, what a charm|ing fellow this deluded man was once. How benevolent, ju&s;t, temperate, and every way virtuous; the only faults of his mind aro&s;e from motives of humanity; he was too ea&s;y, credulous, and good-natured, and unable to re&s;i&s;t temptation, when re|commended by the voice of friend&s;hip. The&s;e foibles the vicious and the needy &s;oon perceived, and what was at fir&s;t a weakne&s;s they &s;oon perverted into guilt; he became a game&s;ter, and continued the infamous profe&s;&s;ion, 'till he could &s;upport the mi&s;eries it brought with it no longer.</P>
<P>I have often been not a little concerned to &s;ee the fir&s;t introduction of a young man of fortune to the gaming-table. With
<PB N="203" REF="211">
what eagerne&s;s his company is courted by the whole fraternity of &s;harpers, how they find out his mo&s;t latent wi&s;hes, in order to make way to his affections by gratifying them; and continue to hang upon him with the meane&s;t degree of conde&s;cen&s;ion. The youthful dupe no way &s;u&s;pecting, imagines him&s;elf &s;urrounded by friends and gentlemen, and incapable of even &s;u&s;pect|ing that men of &s;uch &s;eeming good &s;en&s;e, and &s;o genteel an appearance, &s;hould devi|ate from the laws of honour, walks into the &s;nare, nor is he undeceived till &s;chooled by the &s;everity of experience.</P>
<P>As I &s;uppo&s;e no man would be a game&s;ter unle&s;s he hoped to win, &s;o I fancy it would be ea&s;y to reclaim him, if he was once effectually convinced, that by continuing to play he mu&s;t certainly lo&s;e. Permit me, my Lord, to attempt this ta&s;k, and to &s;hew, that no young gentleman by a year's run of play, and in a mixed company, can po&s;|&s;ibly be a gainer.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212">Let me &s;uppo&s;e in the fir&s;t place, that the chances on both &s;ides are equal, that there are no marked cards, no pinching, &s;huff|ling, nor hiding; let me &s;uppo&s;e that the players al&s;o have no advantage of each other in point of judgment, and &s;till fur|ther let me grant, that the party is only formed at home, without going to the u&s;ual expen&s;ive places of re&s;ort frequented by game&s;ters. Even with all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in the young game&s;ter's fa|vour, it is evident he cannot be a gainer. With equal players after a year's continu|ance of any particular game it will be found, that, whatever has been played for, the winnings on either &s;ide are very incon|&s;iderable, and mo&s;t commonly nothing at all. Here then is a year's anxiety, pain, jarring, and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and nothing gained; were the parties to &s;it down and profe&s;&s;ed|ly play for nothing, they would contemn the propo&s;al, they would call it trifling away time, and one of the mo&s;t in&s;ipid amu&s;ements in nature; yet in fact, how do equal players differ; it is allowed that little or nothing can be gained; but much is lo&s;t; our youth, our time, tho&s;e moments that may be laid
<PB N="205" REF="213">
out in plea&s;ure or improvement are fooli&s;h|ly &s;quandered away, in to&s;&s;ing cards, fret|ting at ill luck, or, even with a run of luck in our favour, fretting that our winnings are &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>I have now &s;tated gaming in that point of view in which it is alone defen&s;ible, as a commerce carried on with equal advantage and lo&s;s to either party, and it appears, that the lo&s;s is great, and the advantage but &s;mall. But let me &s;uppo&s;e the players not to be equal, but the &s;uperiority of judgment in our own favour. A per&s;on who plays under this conviction, however, mu&s;t give up all preten&s;ions to the approbation of his own mind, and is guilty of as much inju&s;tice, as the thief who robbed a blind man, becau&s;e he knew he could not &s;wear to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>But in fact, when I allowed the &s;uperi|ority of &s;kill on the young beginner's &s;ide, I only granted an impo&s;&s;ibility. Skill in gaming, like &s;kill in making a watch, can only be acquired by long and painful in|du&s;try. The mo&s;t &s;agacious youth alive
<PB N="206" REF="214">
was never taught at once all the arts, and all the niceties of gaming. Every pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;chooled by long habit into cau|tion, and phlegm; the very countenance mu&s;t be taught proper di&s;cipline; and he who would practice this art with &s;ucce&s;s, mu&s;t practice on his own con&s;titution, all the &s;everities of a martyr, without any ex|pectation of the reward. It is evident therefore every beginner mu&s;t be a dupe, and can only be expected to learn his trade by lo&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments, and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>If a young gentleman therefore begins to game, the commencements are &s;ure to be to his di&s;advantage; and all that he can promi&s;e him&s;elf is, that the company he keeps, tho' &s;uperior in &s;kill, are above taking advantage of his ignorance, and un|acquainted with any &s;ini&s;ter arts to correct fortune. But this however is but a poor hope at be&s;t, and what is wor&s;e, mo&s;t fre|quently a fal&s;e one. In general, I might almo&s;t have &s;aid always, tho&s;e who live by gaming, are not beholding to chance alone for their &s;upport, but take every ad|vantage
<PB N="207" REF="215">
which they can practi&s;e without danger of detection. I know many are apt to &s;ay, and I have once &s;aid &s;o my&s;elf, that after I have &s;huffled the cards, it is not in the power of a &s;harper to pack them; but at pre&s;ent I can confidently a&s;&s;ure your Lord|&s;hip, that &s;uch rea&s;oners are deceived. I have &s;een men both in <HI>Paris,</HI> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> who, after three deals, could give whatever hands they plea&s;ed to all the company. However, the u&s;ual way with &s;harpers is to correct fortune thus but once in a night, and to play in other re&s;pects without blunder or mi&s;take, and a per&s;e|verance in this practice always balances the year in their favour.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate all the tricks and arts practi&s;ed upon cards; few but have &s;een tho&s;e bungling poor fellows who go about at coffee-hou&s;es perform their clum&s;y feats, and yet, indifferently as they are ver&s;ed in the trade, they often deceive us; when &s;uch as the&s;e are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of &s;o much art, what mu&s;t not tho&s;e be, who have been bred up to gaming from
<PB N="208" REF="216">
their infancy, who&s;e hands are not like tho&s;e mentioned above, rendered callous by labour, who have continual practice in the trade of deceiving, and where the eye of the &s;pectator is le&s;s upon its guard.</P>
<P>Let the young beginner only reflect, by what a variety of methods it is po&s;&s;ible to cheat him, and perhaps it will check his confidence. His antagoni&s;ts may act by &s;igns and confederacy, and this he can never detect; they may cut to a particular card after three or four hands have gone about, either by having that card pinch|ed, or broader than the re&s;t, or by having an exceeding fine wire thru&s;t between the folds of the paper, and ju&s;t peeping out at the edge. Or the cards may be chalk|ed with particular marks, which none but the &s;harper can under&s;tand, or a new pack may be &s;lipped in at a proper oppor|tunity. I have known my&s;elf in <HI>Paris,</HI> a fellow thus detected with a tin ca&s;e, con|taining two packs of cards concealed with|in his &s;hirt &s;leeve, and which, by means of a &s;pring, threw the cards ready packed
<PB N="209" REF="217">
into his hands. The&s;e and an hundred other arts may be practi&s;ed with impunity, and e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>The great error lies in imagining every fellow with a laced coat to be a gentleman. The addre&s;s and tran&s;ient behaviour of a man of breeding are ea&s;ily acquired, and none are better qualified than game&s;ters in this re&s;pect. At fir&s;t, their complai&s;ance, civility, and appa|rent honour is plea&s;ing, but upon examina|tion, few of them will be found to have their minds &s;ufficiently &s;tored with any of the more refined accompli&s;hments, which truly characterize the man of breed|ing. This will commonly &s;erve as a cri|terion to di&s;tingui&s;h them, tho' there are other marks which every young gen|tleman of fortune &s;hould be apprized of. A &s;harper, when he plays, generally hand|les and deals the cards aukwardly like a bungler; he advances his bets by de|grees, and keeps his antagoni&s;t in &s;pirits by &s;mall advantages and alternate &s;ucce&s;s at the beginning; to &s;hew all his force
<PB N="210" REF="218">
at once, would but fright the bird he in|tends to decoy; he talks of honour and virtue, and his being a gentleman, and that he knows great men, and mentions his coal mines, and his e&s;tate in the coun|try; he is totally dive&s;ted of that ma&s;cu|line confidence, which is the attendant of real fortune; he turns, yields, a&s;&s;ents, &s;miles, as he hopes will be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to his de&s;tined prey; he is afraid of meet|ing a &s;habby acquaintance, particularly if in better company; as he grows richer, he wears finer cloaths; and if ever he is &s;een in an undre&s;s, it is mo&s;t probable he is without money; &s;o that &s;eeing a game|&s;ter growing finer each day, is a certain &s;ymptom of his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The young gentleman who plays with &s;uch men for con&s;iderable &s;ums, is &s;ure to be undone, and yet we &s;eldom &s;ee, even the rook him&s;elf make a fortune. A life of gaming mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a life of ex|travagance, parties of this kind are form|ed in hou&s;es, where the whole profits are con&s;umed, and while tho&s;e who play,
<PB N="211" REF="219">
mutually ruin each other, they only who keep the hou&s;e or the table acquire fortunes. Thus gaming may readily ruin a fortune, but has &s;eldom been found to retrieve it. The wealth which has been acquired with indu&s;try and hazard, and pre&s;erved for a|ges by prudence and fore&s;ight, is &s;wept away on a &s;udden; and when a be|&s;ieging &s;harper &s;its down before an e&s;tate, the property is often transferred in le&s;s time, than the writings can be drawn to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The neglect of bu|&s;ine&s;s, and the extravagance of a mind which has been taught to covet precarious po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, brings on premature de&s;truction; tho' poverty may fetch a compa&s;s and go &s;omewhat about, yet will it reach the game&s;ter at la&s;t; and tho' his ruin be &s;low, yet it is certain.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and in&s;tances could be given of the fatal tendency of this pa&s;&s;ion, which fir&s;t impoveri&s;hes the mind, and then per|verts the under&s;tanding. Permit me to mention one, not caught from report, or dre&s;&s;ed up by fancy, but &s;uch as has

actually fallen under my own ob&s;ervation, and of the truth of which, I beg your Lord&s;hip may re&s;t &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the year 1715, Mr. <HI>J. Hedges</HI> made a very brilliant appear|ance; he had been married about two years to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune; they had one child, a boy, on whom they be&s;towed all that affection, which they could &s;pare from each other. He knew nothing of gaming, nor &s;eemed to have the lea&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for play; but he was unacquainted with his own heart; he began by degrees to bett at the tables for trifling &s;ums, and his &s;oul took fire at the pro&s;pect of immediate gain; he was &s;oon &s;urrounded with &s;harpers, who with calm|ne&s;s lay in ambu&s;h for his fortune, and cooly took advantage of the precipitancy of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>His lady perceived the ruin of her fa|mily approaching, but at fir&s;t, without being able to form any &s;cheme to prevent it. She advi&s;ed with his brother, who at
<PB N="213" REF="221">
that time was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall fellow|&s;hip in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> It was ea&s;ily &s;een, that whatever pa&s;&s;ion took the lead in her hu&s;band's mind, &s;eemed to be there fixed unalterably; it was determined therefore, to let him pur&s;ue fortune, but previou&s;ly take mea&s;ures, to prevent the pur&s;uits be|ing fatal.</P>
<P>Accordingly every night this gentleman was a con&s;tant attender at the hazard ta|bles; he under&s;tood neither the arts of &s;harpers, nor even the allowed &s;trokes of a connoi&s;&s;eur, yet &s;till he played. The con&s;equence is obvious; he lo&s;t his e&s;tate, his equipage, his wife's jewels, and every other moveable that could be parted with, except a repeating watch. His agony upon this occa&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible; he was even mean enough to a&s;k a gentleman, who &s;ate near, to lend him a few pieces, in order to turn his fortune; but this prudent game&s;ter, who plainly &s;aw there were no expectations of being repaid, refu&s;ed to lend a farthing, alledging a former re&s;o|lution again&s;t lending. <HI>Hedges</HI> was at la&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="222">
furious with the continuance of ill &s;ucce&s;s, and pulling out his watch, a&s;ked if any per&s;on in company, would &s;et him &s;ixty guineas upon it: the company were &s;i|lent; he then demanded fifty; &s;till no an|&s;wer; he &s;unk to forty, thirty, twenty; finding the company &s;till without an&s;wer|ing, he cried out by <HI>G&mdash;d</HI> it &s;hall never go for le&s;s, and da&s;hed it again&s;t the floor, at the &s;ame time, attempting to da&s;h out his brains again&s;t the marble chimney-piece.</P>
<P>This la&s;t act of de&s;peration, immedi|diately excited the attention of the whole company; they in&s;tantly gathered round, and prevented the effects of his pa&s;&s;ion; and after he again became cool, he was permitted to return home, with &s;ullen di&s;|content, to his wife. Upon his entering her apartment, &s;he received him with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s and &s;atisfaction; while he an&s;wered her care&s;&s;es with contempt and &s;everity; his di&s;po&s;ition being quite altered with his misfortunes. But my dear <HI>Jemmy,</HI> &s;ays his wife, perhaps you don't
<PB N="215" REF="223">
know the news I have to tell; <HI>My Mam|ma's old uncle is dead, the me&s;&s;enger is now in the hou&s;e, and you know his e&s;tate is &s;ettled upon you.</HI> This account &s;eemed only to en|crea&s;e his agony, and looking angrily at her, he cried, there you lie, my dear, his e&s;tate it not &s;ettled upon me. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I beg your pardon, &s;ays &s;he, I really thought it was, at lea&s;t you have always told me &s;o.</HI>"</Q> No, returned he, as &s;ure as you and I are to be mi&s;erable here, and our children beggars hereafter, I have &s;old the rever&s;ion of it this day, and have lo&s;t every farthing I got for it at the hazard table. <Q REND="inline">"What, all",</Q> replied the Lady. Yes every farthing, returned he, and I owe a thou&s;and pounds more than I have to pay. Thus &s;peaking, he took a few frantic &s;teps acro&s;s the room. When the Lady had a little enjoyed his perplexity. <HI>No my dear, cried &s;he, you have lo&s;t but a trifle, and you owe nothing, our brother and I have taken care to pre|vent the effects of your ra&s;hne&s;s, and are actu|ally the per&s;ons, who have won your fortune; we employed proper per&s;ons for this purpo&s;e, who brought their winnings to me; your mo|ney,
<PB N="216" REF="224">
your equipage, are in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and here I return them to you, from whom they were unju&s;tly taken, I only a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to keep my jewels, and to keep you, my greate&s;t jewel, from &s;uch dangers for the future.</HI> Her prudence had the proper effect, he ever after retained a &s;en&s;e of his former follies, and never played for the &s;malle&s;t &s;ums, e|ven for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s than three per&s;ons in one day, fell a &s;acrifice at <HI>Bath</HI> to this de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion. Two gentlemen fought a duel, in which one was killed, and the other de&s;perately wounded, and a youth of great expectation, and excellent di&s;po&s;ition, at the &s;ame time ended his own life by a pi&s;tol. If there be any &s;tate that de&s;erves pity, it mu&s;t be that of a game&s;ter; but the &s;tate of a dying game&s;ter, is of all &s;ituations the mo&s;t deplorable.</P>
<P>There is another argument which your lord&s;hip, I fancy, will not entirely de&s;pi&s;e; beauty, my lord, I own is at be&s;t but a trifle, but &s;uch as it is, I fancy few would wil|lingly
<PB N="217" REF="225">
part with what little they have. A man with an healthful complexion, how great a philo&s;opher &s;oever he be, would not willingly exchange it for a &s;allow hectic phyz, pale eyes, and a &s;harp wrinkled vi&s;|age. I entreat you only to examine the faces of all the noted gamblers round one of our public tables; have you ever &s;een any thing more haggard, pinched, and mi|&s;erable? and it is but natural that it &s;hould be &s;o. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ions flu&s;h the cheek with red, and all &s;uch flu&s;hings are ever &s;ucceeded by con&s;equent palene&s;s; &s;o that a game&s;ter contracts the &s;ickly hue of a &s;tudent, while he is only acquiring the &s;tupidity of a fool.</P>
<P>Your good &s;en&s;e, my lord, I have often had an occa&s;ion of knowing, yet how mi|&s;erable it is to be in a &s;et of company where the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible is ever the lea&s;t &s;kilful; your footman with a little in&s;truction, would, I dare venture to affirm, make a better and more &s;ucce&s;sful game&s;ter than you; want of pa&s;&s;ions, and low cunning, are the two great arts; and it is peculiar
<PB N="218" REF="226">
to this &s;cience alone, that they who have the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for it, are of all others the mo&s;t unfit to practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever knew, <HI>Spedding</HI> was the greate&s;t blockhead, and yet the be&s;t game&s;ter, he &s;aw almo&s;t intuitively the advantage on either &s;ide, and ever took it; he could calculate the odds in a moment, and decide upon the merits of a cock or an hor&s;e, better than any man in <HI>England</HI>; in &s;hort he was &s;uch an adept in gaming, that he brought it up to a pitch of &s;ublimity it had never attained before; yet with all this, <HI>Spedding</HI> could not write his own name. What he died worth I cannot tell, but of this I am certain, he might have po&s;&s;e&s;t a mini&s;terial e&s;tate, and that won from men, famed for their &s;en&s;e, literature and patri|oti&s;m.</P>
<P>If after this de&s;cription, your Lord&s;hip is yet re&s;olved to hazard your fortune at gaming, I beg you would avert to the &s;i|tuation of an old and luckle&s;s game&s;ter. Perhaps there is not in nature a more de|plorable being, his character is too well
<PB N="219" REF="227">
marked, he is too well known to be tru&s;t|ed. A man that has been often a bank|rupt, and renewed trade upon low com|po&s;itions, may as well expect exten&s;ive cre|dit as &s;uch a man. His reputation is bla&s;t|ed, his con&s;titution worn, by the extrava|gance and ill hours of his profe&s;&s;ion, he is now incapable of alluring his dupes, and like a &s;uperannuated &s;avage of the fore&s;t, he is &s;tarved for want of vigour to hunt after prey.</P>
<P>Thus gaming is the &s;ource of poverty, and &s;till wor&s;e, the parent of infamy and vice. It is an inlet to debauchery, for the money thus acquired is but little valued. Every game&s;ter is a rake, and his morals wor&s;e than his my&s;tery. It is his inte|re&s;t to be exemplary in every &s;cene of de|bauchery, his prey is to be courted with every guilty plea&s;ure; but the&s;e are to be changed, repeated, and embelli&s;hed, in order to employ his imagination, while his rea&s;on is kept a&s;leep; a young mind is apt to &s;hrink at the pro&s;pect of ruin, care mu&s;t be taken to harden his courage, and make
<PB N="220" REF="228">
him keep his rank; he mu&s;t be either found a libertine, or he mu&s;t be made one. And when a man has parted with his money like a fool, he generally &s;ends his con&s;ci|ence after it like a villain, and the nearer he is to the brink of de&s;truction, the fonder does he grow of ruin.</P>
<P>Your friend and mine, my Lord, had been thus driven to the la&s;t re&s;erve, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;entangle his af|fairs, and look the world in the face; im|patience at length threw him into the aby&s;s he feared, and life became a burthen, becau&s;e he feared to die. But I own that play is not always attended with &s;uch tra|gical circum&s;tances, &s;ome have had cou|rage to &s;urvive their lo&s;&s;es, and go on content with beggary; and &s;ure tho&s;e misfortunes, which are of our own production, are of all others mo&s;t pungent. To &s;ee &s;uch a poor di&s;banded being an unwelcome gue&s;t at every table, and often flapped off like a fly, is affecting; in this ca&s;e the clo&s;e&s;t al|liance is forgotten, and contempt is too &s;trong for the ties of blood to unbind.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="229">But however fatal this pa&s;&s;ion may be in its con&s;equence, none allures &s;o much in the beginning, the per&s;on once li&s;ted as a game&s;ter, if not &s;oon reclaimed, pur&s;ues it &s;trough his whole life; no lo&s;s can re|tard, no danger awaken him to com|mon &s;en&s;e; nothing can terminate his ca|reer but want of money to play, or of ho|nour to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Among the number of my acquaintance, I knew but of two who &s;ucceeded by gaming; the one a phlegmatic heavy man, who would have made a fortune in what|ever way of life he happened to be placed; the other who had lo&s;t a fine e&s;tate in his youth by play, and retrieved a greater at the age of &s;ixty five, when he might be ju&s;tly &s;aid, to be pa&s;t the power of enjoying it. One or two &s;ucce&s;sful game&s;ters are thus &s;et up in an age to al|lure the young beginner; we all regard &s;uch, as the highe&s;t prize in a lottery, unmind|ful of the numerous lo&s;&s;es that go to the accumulation of &s;uch infrequent &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230">Yet I would not be &s;o moro&s;e, as to re|fu&s;e your youth all kinds of play, the inno|cent amu&s;ements of a family mu&s;t often be indulged, and cards allowed to &s;upply the intervals of more real plea&s;ure; but the &s;um played for in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;hould always be a trifle; &s;omething to call up attention, but not engage the pa&s;&s;ions. The u&s;ual ex|cu&s;e for laying large &s;ums is, to make the players attend to their game; but in fact, he that plays only for &s;hillings, will mind his cards equally well, with him that betts guineas; for the mind, habi|tuated to &s;take large &s;ums, will con&s;ider them as trifles at la&s;t; and if one &s;hilling could not exclude indifference at fir&s;t, neither will an hundred in the end.</P>
<P>I have often a&s;ked my&s;elf, how it is po&s;|&s;ible that he who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of compe|tence, can ever be induced to make it precarious, by beginning play with the odds again&s;t him; for wherever he goes to &s;port his money, he will find him&s;elf over matched and cheated. Either at
<PB N="223" REF="231">
<HI>White</HI>'s, <HI>New-market,</HI> the <HI>Tennis Court,</HI> the <HI>Cock Pit,</HI> or the <HI>Billiard Table,</HI> he will find numbers who have no other re|&s;ource, but their acqui&s;itions there; and if &s;uch men live like gentlemen, he may readily conclude it mu&s;t be on the &s;poils of his fortune, or the for|tunes of ill judging men like him&s;elf. Was he to attend but a moment to their manner of betting at tho&s;e places he would readily find the game&s;ter &s;eldom propo&s;ing betts, but with the advantage in his own favour. A man of honour continues to lay on the &s;ide on which he fir&s;t won; but game&s;ters &s;hift, change, lie upon the lurch, and take every advantage, either of our ignorance or neglect.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my Lord, if a man de&s;igns to lay out his fortune in que&s;t of plea&s;ure, the gaming table is, of all other places, that where he can have lea&s;t for his money. The company are &s;uperficial, extravagant, and unentertaining; the conver&s;ation flat, debauched, and ab&s;urd; the hours unna|tural, and fatiguing; the anxiety of lo&s;ing,
<PB N="224" REF="232">
is greater than the plea&s;ure of winning; friend&s;hip mu&s;t be bani&s;hed from that &s;o|ciety, the members of which are intent only on ruining each other; every other improvement, either in knowledge or vir|tue, can &s;carce find room in that brea&s;t, which is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit of play; the &s;pirits become vapid, the con&s;titution is enfeebled, the complexion grows pale, till, in the end, the mind, body, friends, fortune, and even the hopes of futurity &s;ink together!

<P>I Mu&s;t de&s;ire your Maje&s;ty to order the inclo&s;ed to be read to the great Mr. <HI>Hoyle,</HI> if he be found in any part of your dominions. You will perceive, that it is a panegyrick on his manifold virtues, and that he is thanked more particularly for &s;pending his time &s;o much to the emolu|ment of the public, and for obliging the world with a book more read than the Bible, and which &s;o eminently tends to promote chri&s;tian knowledge, &s;ound mo|rality, and the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>(<HI>The inclo&s;ed we have omitted, as it contains a &s;atire on gaming, and may probably give of|fence to our betters.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="234">This author, however (continues the letter writer) has not &s;et forth half the merits of the piece under con&s;ideration, nor is the great care which he has taken to prevent our reading any other book, in|&s;tead of this, been &s;ufficiently taken notice of: <HI>beware of counterfeits, the&s;e books are not to be depended on, unle&s;s &s;igned by</HI> E. Hoyle, is a charitable admonition. As you have &s;o much power at <HI>Bath,</HI> and are ab&s;olute, I think you &s;hould imitate other great monarchs, by rewarding tho&s;e with honours who have been &s;erviceable in your &s;tate; and I beg that a new order may be e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e. Let him who has done nothing but game all his life, and has reduced the mo&s;t families to ruin and beggary, be made a <HI>Mar&s;hal of the Black Ace</HI>; and tho&s;e who are every day making pro&s;elytes to the tables, have the honour of knighthood conferred on them, and be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;tyle and title of <HI>Knights of the four Knaves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235">The moment I came into <HI>Bath,</HI> my ears were &s;aluted with the news of a gentle|man's being plundered at the gaming ta|ble, and having lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es on the occa|&s;ion. The &s;ame day a duel was fought be|tween two gentlemen game&s;ters on the Downs, and in the evening another hanged him&s;elf at the <HI>Bear</HI>; but fir&s;t wrote a note, which was found near him, importing that he had injured the be&s;t of friends.

If a few of the&s;e game&s;ters and duellers were gibbeted, it might per|haps help to amend the re&s;t. I have often
<PB N="228" REF="236">

Soon after, a quarrel aro&s;e between two officers of very high com|mand, and as they knew the king's firmne&s;s in pre|&s;erving his word inviolable, they agreed to reque&s;t an audience, and be&s;ought his permi&s;&s;ion to decide the affair like men of honour.

</LETTER>
<P>The author of this letter appears to have been very angry, and not without rea&s;on; for if I am rightly informed, his only &s;on was ruined at <HI>Bath,</HI> and by &s;harpers.
<PB N="230" REF="238">
But why is <HI>Na&s;h</HI> to be blamed for this? It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he al|ways took pains to prevent the ruin of the youth of both &s;exes, and had &s;o guarded again&s;t duelling, that he would not permit a &s;word to be worn in <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>As the heart of a man is better known by his private than public actions, let us take a view of <HI>Na&s;h</HI> in dome&s;tick life; among his &s;ervants and dependants where no glo&s;s was required to colour his &s;enti|ments and di&s;po&s;ition, nor any ma&s;k ne|ce&s;&s;ary to conceal his foibles. Here we &s;hall find him the &s;ame open-hearted, ge|nerous, good-natured man we have already de&s;cribed; one who was ever fond of pro|moting the intere&s;ts of his friends, his &s;er|vants and dependants, and making them happy. In his own hou&s;e no man per|haps was more regular, chearful, and be|neficent than Mr. <HI>Na&s;h.</HI> His table was always free to tho&s;e who &s;ought his friend|&s;hip, or wanted a dinner; and after grace was &s;aid, he u&s;ually acco&s;ted the company in the following extraordinary manner, to
<PB N="231" REF="239">
take off all re&s;traint and ceremony. <Q REND="inline">"Come, gentlemen, eat and welcome, &s;pare, and the Devil choak you."</Q> I mention this circum&s;tance for no other rea&s;on but be|cau&s;e it is well known, and is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ingularity of his character and behaviour.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s thoughts were entirely em|ployed in the affairs of his government, he was &s;eldom at home but at the time of eating or of re&s;t. His table was well &s;erv|ed, but his entertainment con&s;i&s;ted princi|pally of plain di&s;hes. Boiled chicken and roa&s;t mutton were his favourite meats, and he was &s;o fond of the &s;mall &s;ort of pota|toes, that he called them <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pine|apples, and generally eat them as others do fruit, after dinner. In drinking he was altogether as regular and ab&s;temious. Both in this and in eating, he &s;eemed to con&s;ult nature, and obey only her dictates. Good &s;mall beer, with or without a gla&s;s of wine in it, and &s;ometimes wine and water, was his drink at meals, and after dinner he generally drank one gla&s;s of wine. He
<PB N="232" REF="240">
&s;eemed fond of hot &s;uppers, u&s;ually &s;upped about nine or ten o'clock, upon roa&s;t brea&s;t of mutton and his potatoes, and &s;oon af|ter &s;upper went to bed; which induced Dr. <HI>Cheney</HI> to tell him je&s;tingly, <HI>that he be|haved like other brutes, and lay down as &s;oon as he had filled his belly. Very true,</HI> replied Na&s;h, <HI>and this pre&s;cription I had from my neighbour's Cow, who is a better phy&s;ician than you, and a &s;uperior judge of plants, notwith|&s;tanding you have written &s;o learnedly on the ve|getable diet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h</HI> generally aro&s;e early in the morn|ing, being &s;eldom in bed after five: and to avoid di&s;turbing the family, and depriving his &s;ervants of their re&s;t, he had the fire laid after he was in bed, and in the morn|ing lighted it him&s;elf, and &s;at down to read &s;ome of his few, but well cho&s;en books. After reading &s;ome time, he u&s;ually went to the pump-room and drank the wa|ters; then took a walk on the parade, and went to the coffee-hou&s;e to breakfa&s;t; af|ter which, till two o'clock (his u&s;ual time of dinner) his hours were &s;pent in arbi|trating

differences among&s;t his neighbours, or the company re&s;orting to the wells; di|recting the diver&s;ions of the day, in vi&s;it|ing the new comers, or receiving friends at his own hou&s;e, of which there were a great concour&s;e till within &s;ix or eight years before his death.</P>
<P>His genero&s;ity and charity in private life, tho' not &s;o con&s;picuous, was as great as that in publick, and indeed far more con|&s;iderable than his little income would ad|mit of. He could not &s;tifle the natural impul&s;e which he had to do good, but frequently borrowed money to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and when he knew not con|veniently where to borrow, he has been often ob&s;erved to &s;hed tears, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the wretched &s;upplicants who at|tended his gate.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;ibility, this power of feeling the misfortunes of the mi&s;erable, and his addre&s;s and earne&s;tne&s;s in relieving their wants, exalts the character of Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> and draws an impenetrable veil over his
<PB N="234" REF="242">
foibles. His &s;ingularities are forgotten when we behold his virtues, and he who laughed at the whim&s;ical character and be|haviour of this Monarch of <HI>Bath,</HI> now laments that he is no more.</P>

<P>A Volume will be publi&s;hed the Fir&s;t of every Month, till the Whole is completed. Pr. 1 s. 6 d. each, &s;ewed, and embelli&s;hed with Copper-plate Prints.</P>
<P>Biography has, ever &s;ince the Days of <HI>Plu|tarch,</HI> been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t u&s;eful man|ner of Writing, not only from the Plea&s;ure it affords the Imagination, but from the In&s;truction it artfully and unexpectedly conveys to the Under|&s;tanding, It furni&s;hes us with an Opportunity of giving Advice freely, and without Offence. It not only removes the Dryne&s;s and dogmatical Air of Precept, but &s;ets Per&s;ons, Actions, and their Con&s;equences before us in the mo&s;t &s;triking Man|ner; and by that Means turns even Precept into Example: Whence ari&s;es the Propriety of placing the&s;e Volumes in the Hands of Youth.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of uncommon Under&s;tanding, be|ing a&s;ked what was the be&s;t Le&s;&s;on for Youth? an&s;wered, <HI>The Life of a good Man:</HI> And being a&s;k|ed, what was the next be&s;t? replied, <HI>The Life of a bad one:</HI> For, that the fir&s;t would make him in love with Virtue, and teach him how to conduct him&s;elf through Life, &s;o as to become an Orna|ment to Society, and a Ble&s;&s;ing to his Family and Friends; and the la&s;t would point out the hateful Con&s;equences of Vice, and make him careful to avoid tho&s;e Actions him&s;elf which appeared &s;o de|te&s;table in others.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What Hi&s;tories can be found (&s;ays the Mar|quis <HI>De Monte&s;quieu</HI>) that plea&s;e and in&s;truct like the Lives of <HI>Plutarch</HI>? He paints the Man who&s;e Life he relates; he makes him known &s;uch as he was at the Head of the Armies, in the
<PB REF="246">
Government of the People, in his own Family, and in his Plea&s;ures. In &s;hort, I am of the &s;ame Opinion with that Author, who &s;aid, that if he was con&s;trained to fling all the Books of the Antients into the Sea, PLUTARCH <HI>&s;hould be the la&s;t drowned.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of this Work, all tho&s;e Actions which are u&s;ually called Great and Glorious, but which are productive of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Ef|fects, will be particularly con&s;idered, &s;tript of their captivating Glare, and reduced to the Standard of Rea&s;on and of Ju&s;tice.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The WORLD DISPLAYED! Or, a curious Collection of Voyages and Travels, from the Writers of all Nations. In which the Con|jectures and Interpolations of &s;everal vain Editors and Tran&s;lators are expunged; every Relation is made conci&s;e and plain, and the Divi&s;ions of Coun|tries and Kingdoms are clearly and di&s;tinctly noted. In 20 Volumes, Price 1 l. 10 s. &s;ewed, or 2 l. bound in Calf.
<P>Curio&s;ity is &s;eldom &s;o powerfully excited, or &s;o amply gratified, as by faithful Relations of Voy|ages and Travels. The different Appearances of Nature, and the various Cu&s;toms of Men, the gradual Di&s;covery of the World, and the Acci|dents and Hard&s;hips of a naval Life, all concur to fill the Mind with Expection and with Won|der; and as Science, when it can be connected with Events, is always more ea&s;ily learned, and more certainly remembered, the Hi&s;tory of a Voyage may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t u&s;eful Treati&s;e on Geography, &s;ince the Student follows the Travellers from Country to Country, and re|tains the Situation of Places by recounting his Adventures. It is hoped that this Collection wil be favourably received, as no one has hitherto been offered &s;o cheap, or &s;o commodious.</P></ITEM>
