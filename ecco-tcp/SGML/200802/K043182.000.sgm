<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tragedy, which is now of|fered to the Public from the pen of RICHARD GLOVER, E&s;q. Author of LEONIDAS, is a Sequel to the MEDEA, which has been per|formed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with the greate&s;t applau&s;e. This Piece was pre&s;ented by him, many years previous to his death, to the celebrated Mrs. Yates, who pa&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t encomiums upon it; but owing to the grandeur of the &s;cenery, and the expen&s;e required to bring it forward, it was altogether laid a&s;ide; and it has &s;ince that period been offered to the Managers of both Theatres, who &s;till have the &s;ame objection. It is therefore only nece&s;&s;ary to add, that the Public, well knowing the Author's talents, have it in their power to judge of its merits or defects.</P>

With a Pre|face by the Tran&s;lator, comprehending an authentic and intere&s;ting Account of the Trade to the Levant.&mdash;Ele|gantly printed uniformly to bind with Park's and Brown's Travels in Africa, on fine wove paper, hot-pre&s;&s;ed, in one large volume quarto.</P>
<P>A COLLECTION of STATE PAPERS relative to the War again&s;t France, now carrying on by Great Bri|tain and the &s;everal other European Powers. Containing authentic Copies of Treaties, Conventions, Proclama|tions, Manife&s;toes, Declarations, Memorials, Remon|&s;trances, Official Letters, Parliamentary Papers, London Gazette Accounts of the War, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. many of which have never before been publi&s;hed in England.&mdash;Printed uniformly to bind with the Parliamentary De|bates.

<P>OBSERVATIONS on the STATE of the CONTI|NENT, &s;hould France be &s;uffered to retain her immen&s;e Acqui&s;itions.

<P>"This u&s;eful and intere&s;ting publication, in the form of letters, is well timed and well directed. The writer examines, in detail, the conduct of the French from the time of the revolution, and &s;tates, that the accumu|lation of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions increa&s;es the andacity, and confirms the power of their rulers; and that Engli&s;hmen have no re&s;ource again&s;t their in&s;olence, but to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour."<HI>&mdash;Briti&s;h Critic, March</HI> 1799.</P>

<P>"This is, in many re&s;pects, a very agreeable Mi&s;cel|lany. The undertaking is al&s;o a novel one, and will probably be repeated, as the German language is becom|ing every day more and more an object of attention in this country, and as it is well known that the German Journals contain very intere&s;ting and important matter. This collection is completely a mi&s;cellany, as the Com|piler and Tran&s;lator appears to have had in general no ob|ject in view except that of placing before his readers an entertaining variety. It mu&s;t indeed be a fa&s;tidious ta&s;te, which may not in its progre&s;s through the&s;e volumes find &s;ome of the viands it approves."<HI>&mdash;Briti&s;h Critic, Jan.</HI> 1796.</P>

<P>"This little work might be put with advantage into the hands of young ladies who are learning the French language. The intere&s;t their &s;en&s;ible hearts mu&s;t take in the narrative, would animate and alleviate the troubles of overcoming the difficulties of the le&s;&s;on; and they would contemplate more than one or two of the mo&s;t noble mo|dels or examples of female excellence."<HI>&mdash;Engli&s;h Review, Jan.</HI> 1706.</P>

<P>"The&s;e Letters contain much whole&s;ome advice on religious, moral, and prudential &s;ubjects, expre&s;&s;ed in un|affected language; and they are very proper to be put into the hands of young females when they leave the boarding-&s;chool, to correct the fal&s;e notions which they are too apt to gather there, and to prepare them for filling, with credit and advantage, the mo&s;t important of all female re|lations, tho&s;e of a Wife and a Mother."<HI>&mdash;Monthly Re|view, Dec.</HI> 1795.</P>
