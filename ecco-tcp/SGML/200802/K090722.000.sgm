<P>THE editor does not undertake to lay before the public the whole of General <HI>Burgoyne</HI>'s orders during the campaign of <HI>1777.</HI>&mdash;In &s;o exten&s;ive a detail, many would appear quite unintere&s;ting at the pre&s;ent moment, and even at the time they were given, except perhaps to the departments immediately concerned, as far as regarded their execution: &s;uch are tho&s;e re&s;pecting the daily duties, the ho&s;pital, the com|mi&s;erate, drivers, &amp;c. Tho&s;e only have been &s;elected, that have for their object the general arrangements and movements of the army, and which may tend to illu&s;trate the operations of the campaign. There are likewi&s;e &s;ome few by Generals <HI>Carleton</HI> and <HI>Philips,</HI> which are introduced here, as relating in particular to General <HI>Burgoyne</HI>'s expedition.</P>
<P>The editor's principal inducement for offering the&s;e orders to the public, was drawn not only from the idea that the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;tate of the expedition is incomplete without them, but likewi&s;e from the ob&s;ervation of the avidity with which General <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s orders were received by all ranks of people, and particularly by the officers of the army. It was conceived, that if General <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s orders were e&s;teemed as models to commanding officers of corps, as well as in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons in their profe&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e of an inferior rank, General <HI>Bur|goyne</HI>'s would more fully an&s;wer that de&s;cription, as they re|late to military tran&s;actions far more important, and to &s;cenes infinitely more intere&s;ting to the public.&mdash;Be&s;ide that the au|thor of them is known to add to the knowledge and experience of the General all the exterior graces and refinement of the &s;cholar and the writer.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to his Excellency the Lieutenant-General to acknowledge, that the&s;e orders are publi&s;hed without his concurrence or authority.</P>

<P>THE King having been plea&s;ed to order, that a detachment from the army under my command be &s;ent upon an expedition under Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and that this detachment be compo&s;ed of the grenadiers, light-infantry, and 24th regiment; together with the 9th, 20th, 21&s;t, 47th, 53d, and 62d regiments (except a detachment of 50 men from each of the &s;ix la&s;t-mentioned regiments) and all the German troops, except a detachment of 650&mdash;the&s;e corps will accordingly hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march at the &s;horte&s;t notice; orders for which will be given by Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, to whom, in the mean time, they will make all reports, as well as to the commander in chief. The detachments of 50, with a captain, two &s;ubalterns, and non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers in proportion, from each of the &s;ix regiments as above, will a&s;&s;emble at the pre&s;ent head-quarters of their re&s;pective regiments, and there re|main until further orders.</P>

<P>MAjor-general Philips has been directed by the commander in chief to inform the commanding officers of regiments of his excellency's de&s;ire, that the army &s;hould take the field this campaign in the mo&s;t perfect order.</P>
<P>This will depend &s;o entirely upon the &s;everal regiments being pre|pared by exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline&punc; that it is recommended to you to employ the utmo&s;t care and attention on &s;uch material points, where your own character and honour are &s;o intimately connected with the duty and good of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>His excellency the commander in chief has in&s;tructed Major-general Philips to ob&s;erve to you, that the good di&s;cipline of a regiment, in its general oeconomy, behaviour, and conduct in action, will depend on the attention of that re&s;pectable rank of gentlemen, the commanding officers of companies.</P>
<P>It is from this rank of officers, who&s;e time of &s;ervice and experience give them every po&s;&s;ible weight and re&s;pect in a regiment, that the &s;ubaltern officers are to take their example and their orders. It is by the captains that the younger officers are to be in&s;tructed, not only in the common military rules, but in that propriety of conduct, &s;trict &s;ubordination, and indefatigable attention, &s;o ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in a
<PB N="5" REF="6">
regiment, and by which alone the &s;oldiers can be held in that obe|dience to, and confidence in their officers, which will make them bear the fatigues, hard&s;hips, and dangers of a campaign, with patience, with zeal, and with &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Courage has ever belonged to the Briti&s;h troops, and there needs only to ob&s;erve, that a well di&s;ciplined body will always add to it a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principle in war&mdash;conduct.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that the officers &s;hould be perfectly acquainted with the &s;oldiers of their company, and that &s;oldiers &s;hould know their officers, and be accu&s;tomed to the &s;ound of their voices. The exer|ci&s;ing by companies will be the &s;ure&s;t means to effect tho&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>It is well under&s;tood, that all regiments exerci&s;e by companies; but it is u&s;ually done with a view of joining in battalion. It is here meant, that each company &s;hould be led to con&s;ider it&s;elf as a &s;mall, di&s;tinct body, and exerci&s;ed in various evolutions independent of the battalion&punc; with every po&s;&s;ible view for &s;ingle companies being taught to depend upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As from the nature of the pre&s;ent war, the abilities and military &s;kill of officers may be required to be &s;hown in detached parties, and as it may frequently happen, that &s;ingle companies will have to act, when an entire battalion cannot always manoeuvre; by pur&s;uing this idea, which the commander in chief has expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong de&s;ire of, it will leave the officers and &s;oldiers a dependence and attention on each other, and give confidence to both.</P>
<P>It will therefore be proper for every officer of a company to be per|fectly well acquainted with, and to exerci&s;e that company&mdash;for the commanding officer of a battalion to put him&s;elf at the head of one company, and to manoeuvre that company; while the other compa|nies, being drawn up at &s;mall intervals of di&s;tance, follow the evolu|tions &s;o given by the commanding officer.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
As the commander in chief has already ordered regiments in their exerci&s;e to make frequent changes of their po&s;itions and fronts, and to march over difficult ground, it will give the commanding officers of companies opportunities of &s;howing a ready power of taking good po&s;ts; and al&s;o, though there may be certain &s;eparations, owing to inclo&s;ures, ravines, ditches of water, mar&s;hy ground, &amp;c. of con|necting the companies one with another, and with the battalion.</P>
<P>Whenever a regiment, when marching or manoeuvring, is obliged to break into parts, from mar&s;hy ground, ravines, ditches, &s;mall hills, rocks, or thick underwood, it &s;hould be done, if po&s;&s;ible, by com|panies, which &s;hould divide as little as po&s;&s;ible, and never but in &s;uch parts, as an officer or &s;erjeant may have command of &s;uch &s;eparate divi&s;ion; and this not at the will of the &s;oldier, but from the di&s;tinct orders of the officers, &s;o that the &s;eparated divi&s;ions may join, as &s;oon as the ground will permit, into companies, and from companies into battalion.</P>
<P>The changing the order of companies at times, in drawing up the battalion, will make the &s;oldiers ready in forming on general principles, without regarding local &s;tations of companies.</P>
<P>His excellency has in view by this, that the &s;oldiers learn to be &s;teady and attached to their own company and its officers&mdash;that the officers, having a thorough knowledge of their men, and being ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch in&s;tances of &s;eparation as have been de&s;cribed, &s;uffer not the &s;oldiers to act, but from their words of command and orders&mdash;that every company may form a re&s;pectable body &s;ingly, and though attached to its place in battalion, yet always ready to act &s;eparate from it, as the nature of the ground may require, or the nature of the local &s;ervice they may be &s;ent on make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Major-general Philips has endeavoured to explain the commander in chief's plea&s;ure, by &s;ignifying how much his excellency depends
<PB N="7" REF="8">
on the &s;upport of captains commanding companies in this army; and there can be no doubt of every re&s;pectable and attentive obedience to his excellency's injunctions and orders. The commander in chief has not directed any thing relative to commanding officers and field officers of battalions; as his excellency, as well as every general officer of the army, has rea&s;on to depend on their experience, and to be a&s;&s;ured of the &s;trong exertion, and active and &s;pirited zeal of the field-officers for the particular character and credit of their own corps, and for the honour of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>

<P>THE regiments de&s;tined for the expedition under Lieutenant Ge|neral Burgoyne are to leave in their re&s;pective &s;tores their blanket coats, leggings, and all baggage that can be &s;pared during the &s;ummer months.</P>
<P>The officers are depended upon not to incumber the &s;ervice with more baggage than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a campaign, where the movements may be expected to be &s;udden and alert. The portions of batteaux to each regiment will be regulated on tho&s;e principles. Three women per company will be allowed to follow the army.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of the troops under the Lieutenant General's orders is to be confined to firing with ball-cartridges, bayonets fixed, and rapidity of movements in marching, evolutions, and forming.</P>

<P>OFFICERS of all ranks commanding out-po&s;ts and detachments are con&s;tantly to fortify, in the be&s;t manner the circum&s;tances of the place and the implements at hand will permit, felling trees with their points outwards, barricading churches and hou&s;es. Brea&s;t|works of earth and timber are generally to be effected in a &s;hort time, and the &s;cience of engineering is not nece&s;&s;ary to find and apply &s;uch re&s;ources.</P>
<P>The practice of fortifying is u&s;eful in all &s;ervices, but e&s;pecially in this, where the enemy, though infinitely inferior to the King's troops in open &s;pace and hardy combat, is well fitted by di&s;po&s;ition and prac|tice for the &s;tratagems and enterprizes of little war; and neither the di&s;tance of camps, nor the interference of fore&s;ts and rivers, are to be looked upon as &s;ecurity again&s;t their attempts. Upon the &s;ame prin|ciple,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
it mu&s;t be a con&s;tant rule, in or near woods, to place advanced &s;entries, where they have a tree or &s;ome other defence, to prevent them from being taken off by &s;ingle mark&s;men. Together with the&s;e pre|cautions, officers will ever bear in mind, how much the public ho|nour and their own are concerned in maintaining a po&s;t; and that to ju&s;tify a retreat in this war, the number of the enemy mu&s;t be much &s;uperior to that which would make their ju&s;tification, when acting again&s;t a brave and di&s;ciplined force.</P>
<P>The officers will take all opportunities, and e&s;pecially at the be|ginning of the campaign, to inculcate into the minds of the men a re|liance upon the bayonet. Men of half their bodily &s;trength, and even cowards, may be their match at firing; but the on&s;et of bayo|nets, in the hands of the valiant, is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>The enemy, convinced of this truth, place their dependence in entrenchments and rifle-pieces&mdash;it will be our glory and pre&s;ervation to &s;torm where po&s;&s;ible. The attention of every officer is to be em|ployed on his men; to make u&s;e of his fu&s;il, unle&s;s in very extraor|dinary ca&s;es of immediate per&s;onal defence, would betray an ignorance of his importance and of his duty.</P>
<P>No occa&s;ion can make it nece&s;&s;ary to keep the arms loaded in the bell tents; nor are the battalions of the line ever to be loaded on the march, till very near the time they may happen to engage.</P>
<P>No parties are to go from camp with or without arms, unle&s;s with a proportionable number of officers.&mdash;Not only the di&s;cipline and honour, but even the &s;afety of the troops, require the &s;tricte&s;t prohi|bition from &s;traggling and plundering; and the &s;avages, as well as the provo&s;t, will have orders to puni&s;h all offenders in the&s;e re&s;pects in|&s;tantly, and with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
The camp will always be extended as widely as the ground will admit, for the &s;ake of cleanline&s;s and health&mdash;but as it mu&s;t often happen, that the extent will be in&s;ufficient for the line to form in front of the camp, according to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of open files and two deep&mdash;the quarter-ma&s;ter-general will therefore mark out at every new camp the proportion of ground each battalion is to clear, over and above its own front, in order to make the work equal. To clear this ground mu&s;t be the immediate bu&s;ine&s;s after arriving in camp; and in this country it may be often nece&s;&s;ary to have an alarm|po&s;t cleared in the rear, as well as in front.&mdash;By clearing is meant the removal of &s;uch ob&s;tructions as might prevent the ready forming of troops, to receive or advance upon the enemy.</P>
<P>Quarter guards are always to face outwards, and at the di&s;tance of one hundred yards from the bells of arms, with a fl&ecirc;che of earth or timber thrown up before them. When the encampment of the line is with the front to the water, and too near to admit of this regula|tion, the quarter guard is to be po&s;ted in the rear, or tho&s;e of the flank regiments occa&s;ionally upon the flanks. Though the ground will &s;eldom admit a &s;trict regularity in pitching the officers tents, they are never to be placed &s;o as to interfere with the line of defence.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant-general vi&s;its an out-po&s;t, the men are not to &s;tand to their arms, or pay him any compliment. The articles of war, which regard the men, to be read at the head of every regiment to-morrow, at evening parade; and afterwards the&s;e regulations.</P>
<P>The daily duties are to be as follows&mdash;One Brigadier-general for the day, who will vi&s;it the out-po&s;ts, and have a general in&s;pection of the camp. All reports to be made through him, except when any alarm or other exigence requires in&s;tant notice to the commander in chief&mdash;A major of brigade for the day, who is to parade all guards, detach|ments, &amp;c. The picquet, when the la&s;t brigade arrives, will con&s;i&s;t of one field-officer for each wing, one captain each brigade, one &s;ub|altern,

<P>THE Lieutenant-general having received a report from Lieutenant-colonel Breymen, relative to the action of Saintcoick Mills, and likewi&s;e having received every collateral information po&s;&s;ible, thinks it but ju&s;tice to declare publickly, that he has no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atis|fied with the per&s;onal &s;pirit of the troops; that, on the contrary, the officers commanding corps acted with intrepidity on that occa&s;ion. The failure of the enterpri&s;e &s;eems to be owing, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the credulity of tho&s;e who managed the department of intelligence, who &s;uffered great numbers of the rebels to pa&s;s and repa&s;s, and per|haps to count the number of the detachment; and upon ill-grounded confidence induced Lieutenant-colonel Baume to advance too far. The next cau&s;e was the &s;low movement of Lieutenant-colonel Breymen; who, from bad weather, bad roads, and tired hor&s;es, together with other impediments &s;tated by Lieutenant-colonel Brehmen, could not reach 24 miles from eight in the morning of the 15th, to four in the afternoon of the 16th. The &s;uccour therefore arrived too late. The failure of ammunition, in the management of which there &s;eems to have been &s;ome improvidence, was another misfortune; the re&s;t &s;eem common occurrences of war. Upon the whole, the enemy has felt very little &s;ucce&s;s; and there is no circum&s;tance to affect the army with further regret or melancholy, than that which ari&s;es from the lo&s;s of &s;ome gallant men.&mdash;But let the affair of the mill of Saintcoick remain henceforward as a le&s;&s;on again&s;t the impo&s;ition of a treacherous enemy, many of whom, in the very hour of &s;wearing allegiance to the
