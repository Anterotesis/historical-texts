<HEAD>THE My&s;tery Revealed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;omewhat remarkable, that the Refor|mation, which in other countries bani&s;hed &s;uper&s;tition in England, &s;eemed to en|crea&s;e the credulity of the vulgar. At a time when Bacon was employed in re&s;toring true phi|lo&s;ophy, King James was endeavouring to &s;trenghen our prejudices, both by his authority and writings. Scot, Glanville, and Coleman, wrote and preached with the &s;ame de&s;ign; and our judges, particularly Sir Matthew Hales, gave &s;ome horrid proofs of their credulity.</P>
<P>Since that time, arguments of this kind have been pretty much rejected by all but the lowe&s;t cla&s;s. The vulgar have indeed, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, called for ju&s;tice upon &s;uppo&s;ed cri|minals, and when denied, have often exerci&s;ed it them&s;elves: their accu&s;ations, however, in general, fell upon the poor, the ignorant, the old, or the friendle&s;s, upon per&s;ons who were unable to re&s;i&s;t, or who, becau&s;e they knew no
<PB N="2" REF="4">
guilt, were incapable of making an immediate defence.</P>
<P>But of all accu&s;ations of this nature, few &s;eem &s;o extraordinary, as that which has lately engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the public, and which is &s;till carrying on at an hou&s;e in Cock-lane near Smithfield. The continuance of the noi&s;es, the numbers who have heard them, the per&s;everance of the girl, and the atro|ciou&s;ne&s;s of the murder which &s;he pretends to detect, are circum&s;tances that were never per|haps &s;o favourably united for the carrying on of impo&s;ture before. The credulous are preju|diced by the child's apparent benevolence: her age and ignorance wipe off the imputation of her being able to deceive, and one or two more, who pretend actually to have &s;een the ap|parition, are ready to &s;trengthen her evi|dence.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e grounds, a man, otherwi&s;e of a fair character, as will &s;hortly appear, is ren|dered odious to &s;ociety, &s;hunned by &s;uch as im|mediately take imputation for guilt, and made unhappy in his family, without having even in law a power of redre&s;s. Few characters more de&s;erve compa&s;&s;ion, than one, that is thus branded with crimes without an accu&s;er, at|tacked, in a manner, at once, calculated to ex|cite curio&s;ity, and &s;pread defamation, and all without a power of legal vindication. If a per|&s;on
<PB N="3" REF="5">
in &s;uch circum&s;tances di&s;regards calumny, and appears unconcerned, he is then accu&s;ed of ob&s;tinacy and impudence; if he &s;hrinks at the reproach, his timidity is con&s;trued as a &s;ymptom of his guilt: a writer of the life of Urban Gran|dier, who was maliciou&s;ly accu&s;ed, and burnt for being a magician, thus de&s;cribes his &s;itua|tion: <HI>If he &s;poke like an orator,</HI> &s;ays the hi&s;to|rian, <HI>his accu&s;ers ob&s;erve that the devil in&s;pired his eloquence; if he was &s;ilent, they looked upon it as a tacit avowal of his guilt; when he groaned aloud under the torture, they called it ob&s;tinacy; when he fainted away, they a&s;&s;erted, that his fa|miliar had rendered him in&s;en&s;ible.</HI> In &s;hort, if the credulous are re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pect, even op|po&s;ite and improbable circum&s;tances, will &s;erve to awaken &s;u&s;picion; and then calumny &s;hall grow, though incapable of being traced to the author, or though apparently propagated by malice, re&s;entment, or imbecility.</P>
<P>It is, however, a great in&s;tance of the good &s;en&s;e of the public upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that even the vulgar have &s;carce given the &s;mall|e&s;t degree of a&s;&s;ent to this deception. Tho' no &s;cheme was ever laid with more low cunning, and carried on with more indefatigable application, yet it has found but very few partizans, even among the very lowe&s;t of the people, who are ready enough to believe any tale of this nature. They readily perceived that it was but a trick;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
they were only amazed, at what could be the motives for &s;o black an imputation; and pro|bably de&s;ired information; they heard the per|&s;on's character who had been accu&s;ed, very freely treated in the news papers, and perhaps were not unwilling to believe a crime again&s;t a man, whom they had been taught to di&s;like. I &s;hall therefore, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, give the public a more &s;atisfactory account of this whole tran&s;action, than has hitherto tran&s;pired, and that, without partiality or prejudice, I &s;hall repeat nothing as a truth, that will not, upon the clo&s;e&s;t examination, be found <HI>&s;trictly &s;o</HI>; living witne&s;&s;es &s;hall be appealed to in proof of each a&s;&s;ertion. More &s;tudious of defence than recrimi|nation, nothing is a&s;&s;erted that even the oppo|nents will not confe&s;s. It is the duty of every hone&s;t man, to exculpate the guiltle&s;s, and enligh|ten the public, and the&s;e are the only motives for my pre&s;ent publication.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances that gave ri&s;e to this affair, are in &s;hort as follows. In the year 1756, Mr. K&mdash; was married to Mi&s;s E&mdash; L&mdash; of L&mdash; in the county of Norfolk, and during the &s;hort time &s;he lived with him, they enjoyed all the hap|pine&s;s a married &s;tate could be&s;tow. But in about eleven months after their cohabitation, Mr. K&mdash; having taken the Po&s;t-office at S&mdash; in Norfolk, he and his wife were &s;carce &s;ettled there a month, when &s;he died in childbed. This fatal accident therefore determined him to lay a&s;ide all thoughts
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of public bu&s;ine&s;s, but as he had engaged for a year certain at the Po&s;t-office, he was obliged to keep hou&s;e till the expiration of that term. During this interval Mi&s;s F&mdash; L&mdash;, the per&s;on who&s;e gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to appear, and who was &s;i&s;ter to his late wife, and lived with her as a companion, at her decea&s;e continued to re&s;ide with Mr. K&mdash;, in the character of his hou&s;e-keeper. The frequent intercour&s;e ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;oon produced a very tender affection between them. Mr. K&mdash; however finding, that by the &s;trict|ne&s;s of the canon law, he was not allowed to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion, (as his decea&s;ed, wife's i&s;&s;ue by him was born alive, tho' it died a &s;hort time after birth) took a re&s;olution of com|ing up to London, with intentions of pur|cha&s;ing a place in &s;ome public office, and in hopes of finding a cure from ab&s;ence and di&s;&s;ipation. Their affections however &s;eemed to encrea&s;e by ab&s;ence; he con&s;tantly received let|ters from the young lady, filled with repeated entreaties to &s;pend the re&s;t of their lives together, and with po&s;itive prote&s;tations of coming to London after him even on foot, if he did not procure her a more creditable conveyance. The&s;e in&s;tances of her regard and re&s;olution awakened all his pa&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t induced Mr. K&mdash; to comply with her &s;olicitations, thus at once to gratify his own inclination as well as her's. As the canon law would have allowed him to marry her, had there been no i&s;&s;ue born alive from his former wife, he thought him&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="8">
at lea&s;t, <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae,</HI> permitted to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion, nor could he &s;ee why &s;o &s;mall an ob&s;tacle as the birth of a child, that &s;o &s;hort a time &s;urvived its mother, &s;hould prevent his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>During their re&s;idence at S&mdash; they had con|tracted an acquaintance with one Mr. L&mdash; a gentleman who lived &s;ome years in the &s;ame neighbourhood. To this gentleman, who was now &s;ettled in London, Mr. K&mdash; had recour&s;e as a friend; and under&s;tanding that he &s;oon purpo&s;ed &s;pending a fortnight in Norfolk, about Whit&s;un|tide 1759, Mr. K&mdash; communicated the whole affair to him, &s;hewed him her letters, and entreated him, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her re|&s;olution of coming to London, to conduct her up to town upon his return. The gentleman complied, and upon his going into the country, waited upon Mi&s;s F&mdash;, informed her of his in|&s;tructions, and as his principal bu&s;ine&s;s lay at a village about 20 miles di&s;tant from her, where he intended to &s;tay eight or ten days, he de&s;ired to be acquainted with her final re&s;olution by let|ter; accordingly, three or four days before his intended return to town, he received a letter from her, reque&s;ting him to meet her at S&mdash;m, a market town, exactly midway between them. Here they agreed to go for London that night, and as the Yarmouth &s;tage coach was going then for London, they took that opportunity, and ar|rived in town at about five in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">Mr. K&mdash;, not being exactly apprized of the day of her arrival, was at that time at his coun|try lodgings at Greenwich, upon which Mi&s;s F&mdash; took a pair of oars and went to him there. As it was Mr. K&mdash;'s intention for the future to live with her as his wife, he had declared him&s;elf a married man to all his acquaintance long before her arrival, nor were any of them &s;urprized at his bringing home a woman, whom he acknow|ledged as his lawful wife. She was always called by his name, and ever treated and con&s;i|dered as a wife by him; and from their mutual happine&s;s and affection the contrary would have never been known, had not her relations, who by all the ties of honour and genero&s;ity, were concerned to keep it a &s;ecret, taken every oppor|tunity of divulging it to the world, and from a pretended regard for her reputation, endeavour|ed to publi&s;h her &s;hame.</P>
<P>As Mr. K&mdash; could not find an hou&s;e to his mind, he took her to his lodgings near the Man|&s;ion hou&s;e, where however they did not continue long; for to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a gentleman, who publi&s;hed an account in one of the public news papers, &s;igned J. A. L. the people of the hou&s;e where they lodged, did not altogether approve their conduct; and indeed it would be &s;urprizing if they had, for Mr. K&mdash; was oblig|ed to arre&s;t his landlord for above twenty pounds
<PB N="8" REF="10">
that he had lent him, a &s;tep which it is probable this &s;ame landlord did not entirely approve.</P>
<P>From this lodging they removed to Mr. P&mdash;s in Cock-lane near We&s;t Smithfield. But it &s;oon unfortunately happened, that his pre&s;ent land|lord had the very &s;ame cau&s;e of di&s;like to Mr. K&mdash; that his former landlord had. Money was borrowed by this as well as the former, and the &s;ame &s;low di&s;po&s;ition to repay it appeared in the new as well as the old. Mr. K&mdash; was therefore obliged to have recour&s;e once more to law, and to &s;ue his new landlord for twelve pounds, after many vain &s;ollicitations for payment. This, as may naturally be expected, created unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;turbances between them, and the quarrel ro&s;e to &s;uch an height, that at la&s;t he left Mr. P&mdash;'s hou&s;e at an hour's warning, and took ano|ther lodging, at a jeweller's in the &s;ame neigh|bourhood, an inconvenient apartment indeed, but which he expected would &s;erve for a &s;hort time, till an hou&s;e which he had taken in Bart|let-court was fitted up.</P>
<P>Thus far then we &s;ee nothing &s;o very culpa|ble in the conduct of Mr. K&mdash;; there was neither inveigling nor ince&s;t in the ca&s;e, as the world has been taught to believe, the lady's coming to London was almo&s;t again&s;t his con&s;ent, and his living with her after as his wife, was what the canon law would have allowed, had it not been for the child by his former wife, which was born
<PB N="9" REF="11">
alive. This light circum&s;tance prevented a public marriage; but to remedy this, the young lady and he took every precaution to live faithfully together, and to unite their friend&s;hip by the ties al&s;o of intere&s;t. They made their wills mutually in each others favour; Mr. K&mdash;'s fortune was con&s;iderable; hers only amounted to a bare hundred pound; &s;o that if there was any advantage on either &s;ide, it was on the part of the young lady. Yet how has this been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the public by the &s;ame gentleman in the news papers, who &s;igns him&s;elf J. A. L. He &s;eems to intimate, that the lady was inveigled from her friends, and then decoyed into making a will, perjudicial to her own in|tere&s;ts. But who is this Per&s;on, who &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of public ju&s;tice, and takes this open method of a&s;per&s;ing Mr. K&mdash;. There is a gentleman of K&mdash;'s acquain|tance, the initials of who&s;e name are the&s;e let|ters, and whether he really was or not concern|ed in the publication, will be &s;hortly made ap|pear in a due cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If there be any thing very culpable in Mr. K&mdash;'s behaviour, the public has now &s;een it; perhaps a rigid morali&s;t would cen&s;ure him in &s;ome in&s;tances of it, but certain I am, there are few who, con&s;cious of their own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, could not pardon him; what the reader has &s;een how|ever is the only indefen&s;ible part of his cha|racter;
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in all other re&s;pects he was entirely blamele&s;s, and what follows of his conduct, is as open, and as well atte&s;ted, as any evidence that was ever given, and which, in&s;tead of reproach, will perhaps merit approbation.</P>
<P>At his new lodging he had not remained above a week, when Mrs. L &mdash; was taken ill; a phy&s;ician was immediately &s;ent for, who had occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited her before; an apothecary was employed, and every precaution taken that tenderne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t. But the reader will be&s;t determine on the manner of her treatment by the following certificate, drawn up by the phy&s;ician him&s;elf, and &s;igned by him and the apothecary.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="testimony">
<P>SOME time in November 1759, I vi&s;ited Mr. K&mdash; at his lodgings at Mr. P&mdash;'s in Cock-lane, and was then retained, to attend the de|cea&s;ed F&mdash; &mdash; in her expected labour, &s;he being then in the &s;ixth month of her pregnancy. In the cour&s;e of the following months, I vi&s;ited her occa&s;ionally, twice or thrice in the &s;ame hou&s;e; on the 25th of January fol|lowing, I received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. K&mdash;, about nine in the morning, that the lady was ill, and wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I found them removed from P&mdash;'s, to an inconvenient apartment in the neighbourhood. I found the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
lady, deceived by an acute pain in the back, into an opinion that &s;he was actually in labour; but on my declaring the contrary, found not only &s;he, but the women about her, were ex|tremely unea&s;y, &s;till &s;u&s;pecting I had formed a wrong judgment; after a few hours, Mr. K&mdash; informed me, he had taken a hou&s;e in Bart|let's-court, near Red-lyon &s;treet Clerkenwell, and, if I thought there was no danger, would be glad to remove her thither; I told him, there were no &s;igns of labour, but that, from the &s;ymptoms, &s;he would probably be ill &s;ome time, as I apprehended an eruptive fever, tho' I had not, at that time, any &s;u&s;picion of the &s;mall-pox, as I did not know &s;he had never had them. In the afternoon, I attended the decea&s;ed in a coach (having properly &s;ecured her from re|ceiving any injury by cold) to the hou&s;e; Mr. K&mdash; having been before &s;ent, to prepare the apartment. I had her immediately put to bed, ordered her to be blooded, and pre&s;cribed &s;uch cordial medicines, as I thought were proper to throw out an eruption; a nur&s;e was immediately provided, and all nece&s;&s;aries, for the care of the &s;ick patient. The next morning, I met Mr. Jones her apothecary, by appointment, the erup|tion began to appear, and from the violent lum|bago of the day before, and other &s;ymptoms, we progno&s;ticated a confluent &s;mall-pox, of a very virulent nature; Mr. K&mdash; was inform'd, that in her &s;ituation, the mo&s;t favourable &s;pecies of that di&s;temper, would be extreamly hazar|dous;
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and that her's being a bad &s;ort, the danger was very great; we endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, by early bli&s;terings, and admini&s;tered me|dicines of a cordial nature; the &s;ymptoms were, for the fir&s;t four or five days, rather favourable; but, when maturation &s;hould have been per|formed, the pul&s;e flagged, the fever &s;unk, and the whole eruption put on a wharty pallid ap|pearance; and, as &s;he could not &s;wallow, but with difficulty, &s;he could but &s;eldom be prevailed on to take any thing; &s;he was her&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of her danger, and Mr. K&mdash; was told, &s;he could not &s;urvive three or four days; he was advi&s;ed therefore to procure a mini&s;ter to vi&s;it her, which was accordingly done; for the la&s;t two days, no per&s;ua&s;ion could bring her to ta&s;te any thing; &s;o that, for near fifty hours before &s;he died, &s;he hardly &s;wallowed a pint of any fluid whatever, and that only, when my&s;elf, or the apo|thecary were pre&s;ent to admini&s;ter it to her. The la&s;t morning of her life we found her extreamly low, her eyes &s;unk, her &s;peech failing, and her intellects very imperfect; we told Mr. K&mdash;, &s;he could not then live twelve hours.&mdash;Accord|ingly, a &s;hort time after we left her, her &s;peech was wholly taken from her, &s;he became &s;en&s;e|le&s;s, a little convul&s;ed, and expired in the even|ing, viz. on the 2d of Feb. 1762.</P>

<P>By this we find the lady taken ill of a di&s;or|der, in it&s;elf extremely dangerous, &s;till more &s;o, at her mature time of life, but mo&s;t of all &s;o, as the patient was now far advanced in her preg|nancy. We &s;ee her treated in the mo&s;t judi|cious manner by per&s;ons of learning and credit, her danger progno&s;ticated with judgment and accuracy; and her di&s;order going thro' all the regular but fatal &s;tages, peculiar to the &s;mall-pox alone, together with her death foretold, and prepared for four days before it hap|pened.</P>
<P>After &s;uch an atte&s;tation, we may judge what credit is to be given to the &s;uppo&s;ed gho&s;t, when among the re&s;t of her an&s;wers, &s;he a&s;&s;erts, that &s;he was poi&s;oned but three hours before &s;he died. It here appears, &s;he &s;wallowed nothing but in the pre&s;ence of the phy&s;ician, at lea&s;t fifty hours before her death; and, in fact, there was no great nece&s;&s;ity to poi&s;on her, if there had been &s;uch an intention, and if &s;he could &s;wallow, when the doctor and apothecary
<PB N="14" REF="16">
both joined in a&s;&s;erting &s;he could not live twelve hours; and when the &s;ymptoms of approaching death but too vi&s;ibly promi&s;ed to anticipate the operations of even the &s;tronge&s;t poi&s;on, &s;o as to make the perpetration needle&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;uch a full vindication therefore, the reader may judge what credit is to be given to the calumny of the per&s;on who &s;ub&s;cribes him|&s;elf R&mdash; B&mdash;, a man, at be&s;t&mdash;but I will have more tenderne&s;s to his character than he had to that of Mr. K&mdash;; it is enough to ob|&s;erve, that he was connected with her relations, and &s;aw nothing that he relates, there can be no credit therefore given to this man, when he a&s;&s;ures the public, that &s;he was <HI>purely,</HI> or in a fair way of doing well, the day before &s;he died.</P>
<P>In fact, &s;o far from being &s;o, that &s;he per|ceived her&s;elf the approaches of death, and pre|vailed on Mr. K&mdash; to &s;end for one Mr. M&mdash;s, an eminent attorney of her acquaintance, to ex|amine her will in Mr. K&mdash;'s favour, and if not found a good one, to draw it over anew. Up|on Mr. M&mdash;'s declaring the will to be good, &s;he a&s;ked this gentleman, if it could not be made &s;till more &s;trongly in Mr. K&mdash;'s favour: to which he replied in the negative: upon which, declaring her &s;atisfaction, Mr. K&mdash; a&s;ked her, if &s;he would chu&s;e to give any thing to any of her
<PB N="15" REF="17">
relations? to which &s;he replied, no: he then de|&s;ired to know, if &s;he cho&s;e to divide her cloaths among her &s;i&s;ters? to which &s;he an&s;wered with &s;ome emotion, I have nothing to give to any one but you. She was at that time &s;en&s;ible, and &s;urely, had &s;he her&s;elf &s;u&s;pected any foul treat|ment, &s;he would never have carried her affec|tion &s;o far, as to reward the cau&s;e of her de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>But &s;he was al&s;o attended by a divine of the church of England, Mr. A&mdash;, a gentleman equally remarkable for his benevolence, learn|ing, and morals: he was a witne&s;s to Mr. K&mdash;'s treatment and her behaviour; he de|clares, and has often declared, that never, dur|ing the time of his vi&s;its, did he &s;ee a grief more expre&s;&s;ive than in Mr. K&mdash;, nor a tenderne&s;s more affecting than in the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he died, Mr. K&mdash; &s;ent her &s;i&s;ter, who lived in Pall-mall, the earlie&s;t notice; or|dered an undertaker to make as good a coffin as he could, both lined and covered; but being apprehen&s;ive of a pro&s;ecution, if he gave her his own name upon it; and being unwilling to give her any other, he de&s;ired that no name &s;hould be fixed; but afterwards, when called upon for to have her name regi&s;tered; finding him&s;elf obliged to give &s;ome name, he gave her his own, being determined &s;he &s;hould not &s;uffer reproach, whatever might be the re&s;ult.

Her funeral was as decent as his circum&s;tances could permit; and her &s;i&s;ter, who was pre&s;ent, wept over the corp&s;e for &s;ome time before the coffin was &s;crewed down; by which it farther appears, what credit &s;hould be given to the afore&s;aid B&mdash;, when he &s;ays, <HI>that her &s;i&s;ter was deprived of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her dear &s;i&s;ter's body, as the coffin had been &s;crewed down &s;ome time before &s;he came to the hou&s;e.</HI> Her &s;i&s;ter wept for &s;ome time over the body while yet ex|po&s;ed, and the coffin being then &s;crewed down, &s;he attended it with the company to the vault in St. J&mdash; Clerkenwell, and &s;eemed at that time well &s;atisfied with her &s;i&s;ter's treatment. Mr. K&mdash; upon their return, offered her any part of the cloaths of the decea&s;ed, or the whole, if &s;he cho&s;e them: to which &s;he replied, that &s;he looked upon Mr. K&mdash;'s behaviour to her &s;i&s;ter in the &s;ame light as if they had been actually married; and that he was welcome to all that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of belonging to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Such is the plain narrative of the behaviour of Mr. K&mdash; to Mi&s;s L&mdash;, not &s;upported by mere a&s;&s;ertion, but by facts that will bear the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny; not by witne&s;&s;es remote or ob&s;cure, but by per&s;ons of undoubted credit, candour, and veracity; not produced as &s;up|porters of a controver&s;y, for the accu&s;ation is too ridiculous to admit one, but mentioned in order to carry conviction. And, indeed, it was happy for him, that his conduct was ob&s;erved
<PB N="17" REF="19">
by a greater number of per&s;ons than are gene|rally pre&s;ent upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, his behaviour could admit of no &s;u&s;picion, and there were no &s;u&s;picious characters concern'd in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who had behaved in &s;o fair and open a manner, might &s;urely have no rea&s;on to expect reproach upon this affair; he might re&s;t in &s;ecurity, that no accu&s;ation or calumny, ari&s;ing from his former conduct, could affect him now; but he was attacked from a quarter, that no per&s;on in his &s;en&s;es could in the lea&s;t have imagined, in a manner, that but to men|tion, would have excited the laughter of thou|&s;ands: after an interval of two years, all of a &s;udden, he was &s;urprized with the horrid impu|tation of being a murderer, of having murder|ed the per&s;on he held mo&s;t dear upon earth, of having murdered her by poi&s;on: and who is his accu&s;er? Why, a gho&s;t! The reader laughs; yet, ridiculous as the witne&s;s is, groundle&s;s as the accu&s;ation, it has &s;erved to make one man compleatly unhappy. The &s;lighte&s;t evils, by frequent repetition, at la&s;t become real misfor|tunes, and the imputation of great crimes, how|ever un&s;upported, often blacken a character more than the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;maller ones.</P>
<P>I would not chu&s;e to pall the reader with a repetition of tran&s;actions, which he has already heard too often repeated, but the &s;tory of the gho&s;t is in brief, as follows: &mdash; For &s;ome time a knocking and &s;cratching has
<PB N="18" REF="20">
been heard in the night at Mr. P&mdash;s's, where Mr. K&mdash; and Mrs. L&mdash; formerly lodged, to the great terror of the family; and &s;everal me|thods were tried, to di&s;cover the impo&s;ture, but without &s;ucce&s;s. This knocking and &s;cratching was generally heard in a little room, in which Mr. P&mdash;s's two children lay; the elde&s;t of which was a girl about twelve or thirteen years old. The purport of this knocking was not thoroughly conceived, till the elde&s;t child pretended to &s;ee the actual gho&s;t of the decea&s;ed lady mentioned above. When &s;he had &s;een the gho&s;t, a weak, ig|norant publican al&s;o, who lived in the neighbour|hood, a&s;&s;erted that he had &s;een it too; and Mr. P&mdash;s him&s;elf, (the gentleman whom Mr. K&mdash; had di&s;obliged by &s;uing for money) he al&s;o &s;aw the gho&s;t about the &s;ame time: the girl &s;aw it without hands, in a &s;hrowd; the other two &s;aw it with hands, all luminous and &s;hining. There was one unlucky circum&s;tance however in the apparition: though it appeared to three &s;everal per&s;ons, and could knock, &s;cratch, and flutter, yet its coming would have been to no manner of purpo&s;e, had it not been kindly a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by the per&s;ons thus haunted. It was impo&s;&s;ible for a gho&s;t that could not &s;peak, to make any di&s;covery; the people there|fore, to whom it appeared, kindly undertook to make the di&s;covery them&s;elves; and the gho&s;t, by knocking, gave its a&s;&s;ent to their method of wording the accu&s;ation; thus there was nothing illegal on any &s;ide, Mr. K&mdash;'s character was blackened, without an accu&s;er; the per&s;ons haunted only a&s;ked que&s;tions, no doubt, mere|ly
<PB N="19" REF="21">
from curio&s;ity, without any a&s;&s;ertion that could be reprehended; and an&s;wers by knock|ing could by no means be looked upon as a legal cau&s;e of impeachment. Thou&s;ands, who believed nothing of the matter came, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to detect its fal&s;ehood, or &s;atisfy cu|rio&s;ity; and the words poi&s;on and murder being frequently joined with the name of the &s;up|po&s;ed offender, that name became every where public, joined to an accu&s;ation, which, whe|ther believed or not in it&s;elf, is to a &s;en&s;ible mind &s;ufficient mi&s;ery: to become every where remarkable by imputed guilt, is certainly a &s;tate of unea&s;ine&s;s, that only falls &s;hort of a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of real villainy.</P>
<P>When therefore the &s;pirit taught the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, or rather the a&s;&s;i&s;tants had taught the &s;pi|it, (for that could not &s;peak) that Mr. K&mdash; was the murderer, the road lay then open, and every night the farce was carried on, to the amu&s;e|ment of &s;everal, who attended with all the good-humour, which the &s;pending one night with novelty in&s;pires; they je&s;ted with the gho&s;t, &s;oothed it, flattered it, while none was truly unhappy, but him who&s;e character was thus re|peatedly rendered odious, and trifled with, merely to amu&s;e idle curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>To have a proper idea of this &s;cene, as it is now carried on, the reader is to conceive a very &s;mall room with a bed in the middle, the girl,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
at the u&s;ual hour of going to bed, is undre&s;&s;ed, and put in with proper &s;olemnity; the &s;pectators are next introduced, who &s;it looking at each other, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing laughter, and wait in &s;ilent expectation for the opening of the &s;cene. As the gho&s;t is a good deal offended at incredulity, the per&s;ons pre&s;ent are to conceal theirs, if they have any, as by this concealment they can only hope to gratify their curio&s;ity. For, if they &s;hew either before, or when the knocking is begun, a too prying, inqui&s;itive, or ludicrous turn of thinking, the gho&s;t continues u&s;ually &s;ilent, or, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Fanny is angry. The &s;pectators therefore have nothing for it, but to &s;it quiet and credulous, other|wi&s;e they mu&s;t hear no gho&s;t, which is no &s;mall di&s;appointment to per&s;ons, who have come for no other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The girl who knows, by &s;ome &s;ecret, when the gho&s;t is to appear, &s;ometimes apprizes the a&s;&s;i&s;tants of its intended vi&s;itation. It fir&s;t be|gins to &s;cratch, and then to an&s;wer que&s;tions, giving two knocks for a negative, and one for an affirmative. By this means it tells whether a watch, when held up, be white, blue, yellow, or black; how many clergymen are in the room, though in this &s;ometimes mi&s;taken; it evidently di&s;tingui&s;hes white men from negroes, with &s;everal other marks of &s;agacity; however, it is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken in que&s;tions of a private
<PB N="21" REF="23">
nature, when it deigns to an&s;wer them: for in&s;tance; the gho&s;t was ignorant where &s;he dined upon Mr. K&mdash;'s marriage; how many of her relations were at church upon the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion; but particularly, &s;he called her father John in&s;tead of Thomas, a mi&s;take indeed a little extraordinary in a gho&s;t; but perhaps &s;he was willing to verify the old proverb, that <HI>it is a wi&s;e child that know its own father.</HI> How|ever, though &s;ometimes right, and &s;ometimes wrong, &s;he pretty invariably per&s;i&s;ts in one &s;tory, namely, that &s;he was poi&s;oned, in a cup of purl, by red ar&s;enic, a poi&s;on unheard of before, by Mr. K&mdash; in her la&s;t illne&s;s; and that &s;he hear|tily wi&s;hes him hanged.</P>
<P>It is no ea&s;y matter to remark upon an evi|dence of this nature; but it may not be un|nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the gho&s;t, though fond of company, is particularly mode&s;t upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, an enemy to the light of a candle, and always mo&s;t &s;ilent before tho&s;e, from who&s;e rank and under&s;tanding &s;he could mo&s;t rea&s;onably expect redre&s;s. When a committee of gentle|men of eminence for their rank, learning, and good &s;en&s;e, were a&s;&s;embled to give the gho&s;t a fair hearing, then, one might have thought, would have been the time to knock loude&s;t, and to ex|ert every effort; then was the time to bring the guilty to ju&s;tice, and to give every po&s;&s;ible me|thod of information; but in what manner &s;he behaved upon this te&s;t of her reality, will better

<P>"On this night, many gentlemen, eminent for their rank and character, were, by the invitation of the Rev. Mr. Aldrich of Clerkenwell, a&s;|&s;embled at his hou&s;e for the examination of the noi&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be made by a departed &s;pirit, for the detection of &s;ome enormous crime".</P>
<P>"About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber, in which the girl, &s;uppo&s;ed to be di|&s;turbed by a &s;pirit, had, with proper caution, been put to bed by &s;everal ladies: they &s;at ra|ther more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down &s;tairs, where they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, any knowledge or belief of fraud."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">"The &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit had before publicly promi&s;ed, by an affirmative knock, that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the vault under the church of St. John, Clerken|well, where the body is depo&s;ited, and give a token of her pre&s;ence there by a knock upon her coffin; it was therefore determined to make this trial of the exi&s;tence or veracity of the &s;up|po&s;ed &s;pirit."</P>
<P>"While they were enquiring and deliberating, they were &s;ummoned into the girl's chamber by &s;ome ladies, who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and &s;cratches: when the gentle|men entered, the girl declared, that &s;he felt the &s;pirit like a mou&s;e upon her back; and was re|quired to hold her hands out of bed. From that time, though the &s;pirit was very &s;olemnly re|quired to manife&s;t its exi&s;tence, by appearance, by impre&s;&s;ion on the hand, or body of any pre|&s;ent, by &s;cratches, knocks, or any agency, no evidence of any preternatural power was exhi|bited."</P>
<P>"The &s;pirit was then very &s;eriou&s;ly adverti&s;ed, that the per&s;on, to whom the promi&s;e was made of &s;triking the coffin, was then about to vi&s;it the vault, and that the performance of the promi&s;e was then claimed. The company, at one, went into the church, and the gentleman, to whom the promi&s;e was made, went, with one
<PB N="24" REF="26">
more, into the vault. The &s;pirit was &s;olemnly required to perform its promi&s;e; but nothing more than &s;ilence en&s;ued. The per&s;on, &s;up|po&s;ed to be accu&s;ed by the &s;pirit, then went down, with &s;everal others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return, they examined the girl, but could draw no confe&s;&s;ion from her: between two and three, &s;he de&s;ired, and was permitted, to go home with her father."</P>
<P>"It is therefore the opinion of the whole a&s;|&s;embly, that the child has &s;ome art of making or counterfeiting particular noi&s;es, and that there is no agency of any higher cau&s;e."</P>

<P>Such an account will convince tho&s;e who are under the influence of rea&s;on, but nothing can gain over &s;ome, who from their infancy have been taught to believe, but not to think. To convince &s;uch it were to be wi&s;hed, that the com|mittee had continued their &s;crutiny a night or two longer, by which means the impo&s;tor would in all probability be caught in the fact, or at lea&s;t more thoroughly detected. For if the gho&s;t per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch company to continue &s;i|lent, it would then be obvious, that it was afraid of the di&s;covery it pretended to aim at; or if it continued to knock or &s;cratch, the noi&s;es, by explaining them&s;elves, could not long fru&s;|trate a judicious enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">But as it is, the gho&s;t &s;till continues to prac|ti&s;e as before, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure remains un|detected; and it is probable, that &s;he will thus continue for a much longer time, to exhibit among friends who de&s;ire no detection, or a|mong the curious, who&s;e plea&s;ure is in proportion to the deception. The gho&s;t knows perfectly well before whom to exhibit. She could as we &s;ee venture well enough to fright the ladies, or perhaps &s;ome men, about as couragious as ladies, and as di&s;cerning; but when the committee had come up, and gathered round the bed, it was no time then to attempt at deception, the gho&s;t was angry, and very judiciou&s;ly kept her hun|ters at bay.</P>
<P>But let not the reader imagine, that I would &s;eriou&s;ly produce formal arguments to refute an accu&s;ation, which upon the fir&s;t blu&s;h an|&s;wers it&s;elf; what was once &s;aid to a writer, who drew up a book to prove the iniquity of the Inqui&s;ition, might in &s;uch a ca&s;e be applied to me. <HI>Men,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who read books of con|trover&s;y, are already convinced of the ab&s;urdity you undertake to refute; while tho&s;e who believe &s;uch fal&s;ehoods, never examine their own opinions, and will con&s;equently never read yours.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion in this ca&s;e, therefore, is not, whether the gho&s;t be true or fal&s;e, but who are
<PB N="26" REF="28">
the contrivers, or what can be the motives for this vile deception? to attempt to a&s;&s;ign the motives of any action, is not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k as many imagine. A thou&s;and events have ri&s;en from caprice, pride or mere idlene&s;s, which an undi&s;cerning &s;pectator might have attributed to rea&s;on, re&s;entment, and clo&s;e laid de&s;ign. It would not therefore become me, who have been now endeavouring to vindicate innocence, to lay the blame of this impo&s;ture on any individual upon earth, tho' never &s;o rationally to be &s;u&s;pected; All I &s;hall &s;ay is, that, as the reader may remem|ber, Mr. K&mdash; has many who owe him an ill will. His landlord at one hou&s;e, whom he arre&s;ted for money lent him, had cau&s;e of re&s;entment; his lardlord in Cock-lane, the father of the child, whom he was obliged to &s;ue from &s;imilar mo|tives, was, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, willing enough to retaliate the &s;uppo&s;ed injury. But above all, Mrs. L&mdash;'s relations, who had filed a bill in chancery again&s;t him, ju&s;t two months before this infernal agent appeared to &s;trengthen their plea. This law-&s;uit between him and the family of the decea&s;ed, is of a dome&s;tic nature, and therefore unfit at pre&s;ent to be laid before the public; all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned, is, that their animo&s;ity has been carried to the high|e&s;t pitch, and that &s;ince its commencement, they have pur&s;ued him with implacable re&s;ent|ment; what may be the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, or of their anger, the proper judges and not the
<PB N="27" REF="29">
public are to determine; but whether it goes for or again&s;t him, the world may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that the whole true &s;tate of this chancery &s;uit (as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with law) will be very minutely laid before them, upon a proper occa&s;ion; for the pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that it was com|menced in November la&s;t, while Mr. K&mdash; was upon a journey for his brother, and that when he returned, to put in his appearance, he &s;oon found a pro&s;ecution of a much more terrible na|ture commenced again&s;t him, more terrible, as unexpected, and more dangerous, as the cau&s;e was unknown.</P>
<P>I have now as briefly, and indeed as tenderly as I could, &s;tated the whole of this mo&s;t &s;urprizing tran&s;action, and the reader by this time &s;ees how far Mr. K&mdash; is culpable. He &s;ees him living affectionately with a woman as his wife, whom the laws of nature allowed him to love, but the &s;trictne&s;s of the canon law forbade him to marry. He &s;ees every po&s;&s;ible method taken to pre&s;erve this woman's reputation and life, and the mo&s;t reputable per&s;ons produced, as witne&s;&s;es of her end. He &s;ees men of the highe&s;t rank, both for birth, character, and learning, joined to ac|knowledge the whole of the pretended gho&s;t, as an impo&s;ition upon the public; and la&s;tly, he &s;ees tho&s;e who pretend to bear witne&s;s to the accu&s;a|tion, per&s;ons of a mixed reputation, of gro&s;s ignorance, great cruelty, and what is more,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
armed with re&s;entment again&s;t him. I would not wi&s;h however, to turn the popular re&s;ent|ment upon any particular per&s;on, but I think it my duty to divert it &s;ome where from the guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;till it &s;eems &s;omething extraordinary, how this impo&s;ition could be &s;o long carried on with|out a di&s;covery. However, when we compare it to &s;ome others, which have &s;ucce&s;sfully deceived the public a yet longer time, our wonder will be in &s;ome mea&s;ure dimini&s;hed. It was the ob|&s;ervation of Era&s;mus, that whenever people flock to &s;ee a miracle, they are generally &s;ure of &s;eeing a miracle; they bring an heated imagination, and an eager curio&s;ity to the &s;cene of action, give them&s;elves up blindly to deception, and each is better plea&s;ed with having it to &s;ay, that he had &s;een &s;omething very &s;trange, than that he was made the dupe of his own credulity. There are many alive now, who mu&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, remember the famous impo&s;tor Richard Hatha|way, who&s;e ca&s;e is recorded in the State Trials. This ignorant creature deceived the public both &s;ucce&s;sfully and long. He vomited in public crooked pins, which he had previou&s;ly &s;wal|lowed in private; he accu&s;ed an innocent per|&s;on of magic; he pretended to fa&s;t for a month together, and even in this deceived his guardians, with twenty other feats; by which means, the per&s;on he accu&s;ed was actually impri&s;oned, and
<PB N="29" REF="31">
&s;tood her trial at Guildford a&s;&s;izes. The cir|cum&s;tances were &s;trong; but then was not the time for burning for witchcraft, as about an age before: the poor woman was acquitted, and her accu&s;er ordered to pri&s;on in her &s;tead; Hatha|way was con&s;igned to the care of an apothe|cary, who lived in Guildford, if I remember, and here guarded by a maid, who pretended to be &s;orry for his &s;ituation, and took part in his di&s;|tre&s;s: to her therefore he confe&s;&s;ed all his im|po&s;tures, and the apothecary actually detected him at la&s;t through an hole in his chamber wall, either hiding more pins in his mouth, or making an hearty meal upon provi&s;ions the maid had &s;tole for him. Richard however, though put in the pillory as an impo&s;tor, had many partizans of credit and reputation; and &s;ome were &s;o credulous, as to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;incere, even after his own confe&s;&s;ion to the contrary.</P>
<P>The people believed in Richard; but there never was an in&s;tance in which they were in ge|neral &s;o aver&s;e to impo&s;ture as in the pre&s;ent at|tempt to deceive them: it is not known, how|ever, what effect a continuance of tho&s;e endea|vours, if not &s;ilenced by proper methods, may have: it is ea&s;y to conceive how much credu|lity is wrought upon by per&s;everance, <HI>even pious and orthodox divines them&s;elves have been known to give credit to the &s;trange&s;t fal&s;ehoods of this kind:</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="32">
and Glanville declares his &s;olemn belief in a gho&s;t, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in playing tricks, and clattering plates and trenchers.</P>
<P>In fact, the geople can at la&s;t be taught to believe any thing, and may probably, by per&s;e|verance, be taught to believe this; nor can I avoid deploring the ea&s;ine&s;s with which &s;ome, who&s;e duty it is to guide them from error, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led into it. A &s;tory that I am going to relate, will &s;erve as an in&s;tance, how far the public may deceive them&s;elves, and how far even a prote&s;tant divine may, unknowingly, help the impo&s;ture. The account is given us by Adrian Regenvol&s;cius, a prote&s;tant divine, in a work intitled, A Chronological Sy&s;tem of Hi&s;tory, re&s;pecting the Reformation in Sclavo|nia; printed in Utrecht, 1652, p. 95. he men|tions it as a tran&s;action, for the truth of which he can vouch; and his prudence, and the hi&s;to|rian's veracity are confirmed &s;till farther by Voe|tius, one of the mo&s;t eminent theologicians of his time, and who was him&s;elf the editor. The pa&s;|&s;age is this:</P>
<P>"In the number of the&s;e ob&s;tacles to the reformation in Poland, which we have already mentioned, we may add another, namely, about the year 1597, God permitted the appearance of a certain &s;pirit (at fir&s;t it could not be &s;aid whether it was black or white) to delude &s;everal
<PB N="31" REF="33">
from the true faith, after the old &s;uper&s;titions. There was a certain girl, who&s;e name was Biet|ka, who was courted by a young man called Zachary; they were both natives of Weilam, and had received their education there. This youth, though in deacon's orders, and al&s;o &s;oon expecting to be prie&s;ted, was neverthele&s;s re|&s;olved to marry Bietka, and accordingly they mutually plighted a promi&s;e to each other; but his father, in con&s;ideration of the rank which he held in the church, prevented his marriage, up|on which he became melancholy, and &s;oon after hanged him&s;elf. A &s;hort time after his death, a &s;pirit appeared to the di&s;con&s;olate Bietka, which pretended to be the &s;oul of Zachary her lover, a&s;&s;uring her that he was &s;ent by God, to apprize her of his di&s;plea&s;ure at the ra&s;hne&s;s of his death; and that, as &s;he had been the princi|pal cau&s;e of his temerity, he was come to ac|compli&s;h his promi&s;e to her, and to marry her. This fal&s;e &s;pirit knew perfectly well how to ca|jole this poor girl, by promi&s;ing to enrich her &s;o; that he at length per&s;uaded her that he was in reality the &s;pirit of her lover; and &s;he accord|ingly plighted him her marriage vow. The noi&s;e of this extraordinary match, between a woman and a &s;pirit was quickly &s;pread over the whole country, and the curious, from every quarter, flocked in to be witne&s;s of &s;o extraor|dinary an affair.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">Many of the Poli&s;h nobility, who believed in the hone&s;ty of the &s;pirit, became intimately ac|quainted with him; and even many of them brought him home to their hou&s;es. By the&s;e means Bietka ama&s;&s;ed a large &s;um of money, and &s;o much the more, as the &s;pirit would not return an an&s;wer, nor &s;peak to a &s;ingle per&s;on, nor fore|tell the &s;malle&s;t occurrence without his wife's con&s;ent. The &s;pirit lived a whole year in the hou&s;e of the Sieur Trepka, intendant of Craco|via; from thence going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, he went at la&s;t to re&s;ide with a certain widow lady, who&s;e name was Wlodkow, where he re|mained for the &s;pace of two years; and there played all the tricks of which he was capable. The principal are as follow: He told all things pa&s;t and pre&s;ent. He talked in favour of the Ro|man Catholic religion, and a&s;&s;ured his auditors, that the Reformers were all damned. He would not even permit one of them to approach him; for he con&s;idered them as unworthy his conver&s;a|tion; he rather per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;uring his audience, that their only &s;tudy was novelty, and not re|formation: and thus he brought back many again to popery.</P>
<P>Hitherto not a &s;ingle creature had perceived that this &s;pirit was the devil, nor would it have ever been known, had it not been for &s;ome Po|landers, who, going to Rome in the year of
<PB N="6" REF="35">
jubilee 1600, &s;pread the news of the &s;pirit through the whole country. A certain Italian, who under&s;tood magic, hearing this report, among others, and being informed that the &s;pirit had now exhibited five years, recol|lected that he had lo&s;t a &s;pirit about that time, which he had long kept confined near his per|&s;on. This magician therefore went to Poland, and waiting upon dame Wlodkow, demanded his property, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the &s;pectators. He in&s;i&s;ted, that this devil, which had fled from him, &s;hould be re&s;tored back; with which rea&s;onable reque&s;t the lady in|&s;tantly complied: he once more therefore &s;hut up this malicious &s;pirit in a ring, and brought him back to Italy, a&s;&s;uring the people, that, had the devil been permitted to &s;tay in Po|land much longer, he would have drawn down numberle&s;s mi&s;eries upon the nation."</P>
<P>One would think, that a &s;tory of this nature could hardly gain credit, and yet it deceived a whole nation for five years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: what is &s;till more &s;urprizing, it deceived a Prote&s;tant divine, otherwi&s;e of &s;en&s;e, and of learning. I cannot avoid thinking, that there are &s;everal &s;imilar circum&s;tances between this Poli&s;h gho&s;t and the gho&s;t of Cock-lane. The gho&s;t at Cock-lane an&s;wered que&s;tions, &s;o did Zachary; the Cock-lane gho&s;t is vi&s;ited by the nobility, &s;o was Zachary; the Cock-lane gho&s;t plays tricks,
<PB N="14" REF="36">
&s;o did Zachary; the Cock-lane gho&s;t follows a girl, &s;o did Zachary. There is one circum|&s;tance, however, in which the parallel will not hold good; Zachary was believed to be a real gho&s;t by a Prote&s;tant divine; but I fancy no Prote&s;tant divine can be found among us, &s;o much the old woman, as to lend even a moment's a&s;&s;ent to the gho&s;t in Cock-lane.</P>
