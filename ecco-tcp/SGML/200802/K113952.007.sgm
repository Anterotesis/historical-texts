<HEAD>THE COMPARISON BETWEEN JOHN CHURCHILL, DUKE OF MARL|BOROUGH, AND CHARLES CHURCHILL, ANTI-CALEDONIAN.</HEAD>
<L>IN Anna's wars immortal Churchill ro&s;e,</L>
<L>And, great in arms, &s;ubdued Britannia's foes;</L>
<L>A greater Churchill now commands our prai&s;e,</L>
<L>And the Palm yields her empire to the Bays:</L>
<L>Tho' John fought nobly at his army's head,</L>
<L>And &s;lew his thou&s;ands with the balls of lead;</L>
<L>Yet mu&s;t the Hero to the Bard &s;ubmit,</L>
<L>Who hurls, unmatch'd, the thunderbolts of wit.</L>
