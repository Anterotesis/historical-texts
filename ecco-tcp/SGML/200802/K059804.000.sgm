<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_TO remove a Difficulty in my Title, and that we may not &s;tumble at the Thre&s;hold, &s;ome Preface to this new Undertaking may be nece&s;&s;ary, but it will be very &s;hort.</P>
<P>If by <HI>A SYSTEM</HI> of this terrible thing called <HI>Magick,</HI> my Readers &s;hould expect a Body of the Black Art as a Science, a Book of Rules for In&s;truction in the Practice, or a Magical Grammar for Introduction to young Beginners, all I can &s;ay to &s;uch is, that they will be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The World has perhaps been impo&s;ed upon in nothing more than in their Notions of this dark Practice, as well its antient as its mo|dern State. Mo&s;t People, when they read of the antient Magicians, think they are reading of old Necromancers and Conjurers, when really at fir&s;t they were very hone&s;t Men; and now, when they read of them in their mo|dern Practice, they take them for hone&s;t Fel|lows, when they are, generally &s;peaking, meer
<PB REF="7">
Juglers, Cheats, Mountebanks, and Po&s;ture ma&s;ters; or el&s;e, real Wizards and downright Dealers with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>There is One Sort would fain be called <HI>Cunning Men,</HI> than which nothing can be a gro&s;&s;er piece of Delu&s;ion; and 'tis not their Cunning, but their Clients want of Cunning, that gives them the lea&s;t Appearance of Common Sen&s;e in all their Practice. 'Tis a &s;trange Piece of Art where Fools cheat Fools, and the Blind and the Ignorant, are impo&s;ed upon by the Blind and the Ignorant.</P>
<P>All the Di&s;covery I can make by it is, to note what a vi&s;ible Difference there is between Cunning and Wit; between Slight of Hand, as I may call it, and Under&s;tanding. 'Tis evi|dent the Pretenders to Magick at this time are &s;o far from dealing with the <HI>Devil,</HI> that they mu&s;t certainly be dealt with by the <HI>Devil,</HI> that have any thing to do with them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Ages they were Wi&s;e Men; in the middle Age, Madmen; in the&s;e latter Ages, Cunning Men: In the earlie&s;t Time they were Hone&s;t; in the middle Time, Rogues; in the&s;e la&s;t Times, Fools: At fir&s;t they dealt with Nature; then with the <HI>Devil;</HI> and now not with the <HI>Devil,</HI> or with Nature either: In the fir&s;t
<PB REF="8">
Ages the Magicians were wi&s;er than the People; in the &s;econd Age, wickeder than the People; and in our Age, the People are both wi&s;er and wickeder than the Magicians.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no great Harm in our pre&s;ent Pretenders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Magick, if the poor People could but keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Money in their Pockets; and that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould have their Pockets pick'd by &s;uch an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">performing, unmeaning, ignorant Crew as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e are, is the only Magick that I can find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the whole Science.</P>

the <HI>Magi,</HI> and then call them Magicians: if we will debauch the Word with a degeneracy of Practice, the Fault is our own. Their Ma|gick was truly Science, whereas ours is nei|ther Magick or Science, but a kind of <HI>Devi|li&s;m,</HI> a Practice carry'd on, by Men that would be wicked if they did not want Wit, and are no otherwi&s;e Harmle&s;s, than as they happen to be Fools.</P>
<P>Even at its be&s;t, 'tis a <HI>Babel</HI>-like Confu&s;ion, that &s;peaks &s;everal Languages, and none to be under&s;tood; a compleat Degeneracy of, or Deviation from, common Sen&s;e; a Complication of Negatives, that how many &s;oever you put together, won't make up one Affirmative.</P>
<P>Now, to bring this <HI>Nothing</HI> from the <HI>Some|thing</HI> it deriv'd from, tho' it &s;eems a little Difficult, yet 'tis very Nece&s;&s;ary, and this is the Rea&s;on why I call it a Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I have trac'd it as far back as Antiquity gives us any Clue to di&s;cover it by; it &s;eems to have its Beginning in the Ignorance and Curio&s;ity of the darke&s;t Ages of the World, when Miracle, and &s;omething Wonderful, was expected to confirm every advanc'd Notion; and when the wi&s;e Men, having rack'd their Invention to the utmo&s;t, call'd in the Devil to

their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for want of better Help; and tho&s;e that did not run into Satan's Mea|&s;ures, and give them&s;elves up to the Infernal, yet trod &s;o near, and upon the very edge of Hell, that it was hard to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Magician and the Devil; and there they have gone on ever &s;ince: &s;o that almo&s;t all the Di&s;|pute between us and the Magicians is, that they &s;ay they conver&s;e with good Spirits, and we &s;ay if they deal with any Spirits it is with the Devil let the following Sheets determine the Matter.</P>
<L>Hail! <HI>Dangerous Science,</HI> fal&s;ly call'd Sublime,</L>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Meaning of the Terms; who and what kind of People the <HI>Magicians</HI> were, and how the Words <HI>Magick</HI> or <HI>Magician</HI> were originally under&s;tood.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_BEFORE I come to the main End of this Undertaking, which is plainly laid down in my Title, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to explain the Terms, and to determine fully what is and is not to be under|&s;tood by <HI>Magick,</HI> the <HI>Black Art,</HI> and &s;uch like hard Words as we &s;hall be oblig'd to make frequent U&s;e of as we go along.</P>
<P>I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e my Readers not &s;o un|acquainted with the ancient U&s;age, as not to know that the Word <HI>Magick</HI> had a quite different Signi|fication in former Times from what it is now apply'd to, and that the People who &s;tudied or profe&s;s'd that which we now call <HI>Magick,</HI> were quite another &s;ort of Folk, than tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen who now apply them&s;elves to that Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a Word, a <HI>Magician</HI> was no more or le&s;s in the ancient <HI>Chaldean</HI> Times, than a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> a
<PB N="2" REF="15">
Man of Science, who &s;tor'd with Knowledge and Learning, as Learning went in tho&s;e Days, was a kind of walking Dictionary to other People, and in&s;tructed the re&s;t of Mankind in any Niceties and Difficulties which occur'd to them, and which they wanted to be inform'd about; and in this Sen&s;e we are to be under&s;tood when we &s;peak of the Magicians in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in <HI>Babylon,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus when any Omens, ill Signs and Tokens, Dreams, or other &s;trange things happen'd in tho&s;e Times, whether publickly in the Air, or particu|lar to Per&s;ons and Families, we find not only the <HI>ordinary People,</HI> but even Kings and Princes &s;ent im|mediately for the Magicians and the wi&s;e Men, the South&s;ayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to tell them what the Meaning o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch things was.</P>
<P>The&s;e Magicians are explain'd on many Occa|&s;ions by the term of <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> and that Term again by Men of Knowledge, and more than ordinary Under&s;tanding. Men, <HI>in a word,</HI> who &s;tudied Na|ture, look'd up into, and made Ob&s;ervations from the Motions of the Stars and other heavenly Bo|dies, and who, <HI>as 'tis &s;aid in the Scriptures,</HI> under|&s;tood the Signs of the Times, the Face of the Hea|vens, and the Influences of the Superior Luminarie there; who &s;earched into the Arcana of Nature, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were Ma&s;ters of <HI>perhaps a little</HI> experimental Philo+&s;ophy; I &s;ay a little, for Rea&s;ons which I &s;hall re|peat pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It was no Impropriety in Speech to call &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> at that time, tho' perhaps the utmo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their Knowledge might arrive to no more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what we would now ju&s;tly call &s;uperficial. Be|cau&s;e at that time the Knowledge of Nature wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very green and young in the World; and the Phi|lo&s;opher of tho&s;e times, if he was to be rated by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rules Men are plea&s;ed to judge by at this time, woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;omething like our Learned Friend Sir <HI>Tho. J...</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="16">
who&s;e particular Honour it was to be a Doctor among Fools, and a Fool among Doctors.</P>
<P>To the&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> Men went on the &s;everal Oc|ca&s;ions hinted as above for the Solution of <HI>doubt|ful Que&s;tions</HI>; to be re&s;olved and directed in difficult and intricate <HI>Undertakings</HI>; to be advi&s;ed in things of Moment; and the&s;e were therefore called <HI>Sages</HI> fir&s;t, and for a long time; and afterwards <HI>Magi,</HI> from the greatne&s;s of their Wi&s;dom. Hence the wi&s;e <HI>State&s;men</HI> to whom the Government of the <HI>Median Interregnum</HI> was committed were called <HI>Magi</HI>; as wi&s;e Men to whom alone it was fit to intru&s;t &s;o important an Article as that of the Go|vernment of an Empire.</P>
<P>Thus afterwards in the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> times, their <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> were called by another but very &s;ignifi|cant Name or Term (<HI>viz.</HI>) SEERS, a Word after|wards held in &s;uch Veneration, that they thought fit to be&s;tow it upon their <HI>Prophets,</HI> who al&s;o were called <HI>Seers,</HI> tho' afterwards they obtained a &s;upe|rior Title, namely that of <HI>Man of God.</HI> But before that I &s;ay the wi&s;er Men were called <HI>Seers</HI>; and this is mo&s;t expre&s;ly &s;ignified in that eminent Text, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ix.9. where 'tis &s;aid that <HI>before time</HI> they u&s;ed to &s;ay when they wanted to enquire of God, that is to enquire about any thing difficult, <HI>come and let us go to the</HI> SEER, that is to the <HI>Magician,</HI> the <HI>wi&s;e Man,</HI> the <HI>Prophet,</HI> or what el&s;e you plea&s;e to call him.</P>
<P>It is plain from the &s;ame Text al&s;o that they &s;ometimes went to tho&s;e People called SEERS upon meaner Enquiries; for they took it for grant|ed that tho&s;e <HI>Seers</HI> dealt in all &s;ecret Matters; Thus <HI>Ahaziah</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Baal-zebub</HI> when he was &s;ick, to know if he &s;hould live or dye, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> i.2, 3. and &s;o the King of <HI>Syria</HI>'s Captains told their Ma&s;ter, that <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> the Prophet told the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> what he did in his Bed-chamber, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> vi.12. And to bring it down to a meaner Ca&s;e &s;till;
<PB N="4" REF="17">
even when <HI>Saul</HI> wanted but to find his Father's lo&s;t A&s;&s;es or Cattle, his Servant &s;aid to him, <HI>let us go and enquire of the</HI> SEER; and &s;o they did, and found News of them.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e it appears by the &s;ame Text, that tho&s;e <HI>Seers,</HI> or <HI>Prophets,</HI> or <HI>Magi,</HI> made an Employment of it, that it was their Bu&s;ine&s;s to tell Men of their lo&s;t Goods, direct them in their Way, foretel of their Health, and the like; and that they made a Livelyhood or Trade of it; therefore when <HI>Saul</HI>'s Servant propo&s;ed to him to go to the SEER, <HI>Saul</HI> made a Difficulty of it becau&s;e he had nothing to give him; as if he &s;hould have &s;aid, I have no Money in my Pocket, and not a Loaf of Bread to give the <HI>cun|ning Man</HI> or SEER, and how &s;hould I expect that he &s;hould give me any Account of my Cattle for nothing?

<P>It &s;eems the Lawyers Fees were not &s;o high in tho&s;e Days as they have been &s;ince; for if he had not had that Piece of Silver, perhaps about as big as an <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Groat, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> if he had not had that, a couple of half-penny Barly Loaves it &s;eems would have been as good, and have done as well; tho&s;e Loaves being not u&s;ually bigger than our Half-penny, or at be&s;t than our Penny Wheaten brown Bread Loaves are now.</P>

<P>That it was the &s;ame thing with the <HI>Magi</HI> before that, we have no rea&s;on to doubt, tho' we have no Particular in Story relating to that part.

<P>Again afterwards in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar</HI>'s Dream, there is a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony that tho&s;e <HI>wi&s;e Men, A&s;trologers, Magicians,</HI> &amp;c. were e&s;teemed not to be Wizards and Dealers with the Devil, but only (as I have explain'd the Word a|bove) meer <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> or wi&s;e Men, <HI>Men of Lear|ning</HI> and Knowledge, Men of <HI>Science</HI> and of Skill in the works of Nature; for when the King demanded of them to tell him not only the Interpretation of the Dream, but the Dream it &s;elf, and threaten'd them with Death in ca&s;e they fail'd to perform it, they expo|&s;tulate with the King upon the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Propo&s;al, as a thing that no King in the World would expect from them, and that was not in the power of Nature to perform:</P>
<P>As if they had &s;aid, <HI>does your Maje&s;ty think we deal with the Devil, that you &s;hould expect &s;uch a Piece of Work</HI> as this <HI>from</HI> us? <HI>it is not in the Power of any, or of all the wi&s;e Men,</HI> or Philo&s;ophers, <HI>in the World; and therefore it cannot be imagined we &s;hould do it; but let the King tell us the Dream, and then we will interpret it, and that's as much as Man can do.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis plain from hence, not only that the <HI>Magi</HI> or <HI>Magicians</HI> in tho&s;e Days were not really Conju|rers and Dealers with the Devil, but that they were under&s;tood to be what we may call <HI>Scholars,</HI> Men

of Learning, of Wi&s;dom, and of a &s;uperior Un|der&s;tanding: So when the King calls for <HI>Daniel</HI> to prefer him, it is &s;aid he did it becau&s;e an <HI>excellent Spirit was found in him</HI>; and in another Place 'tis &s;aid, that <HI>the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him</HI>; whereas at the &s;ame time 'tis certain that the King e&s;teemed him as one of the <HI>Magicians</HI>; nay, and he was &s;et over them, as the Chief and Governor of all the re&s;t.

<P>This appears in all their &s;ub&s;equent Conduct, from the fir&s;t peopling of the World after <HI>Noah</HI> to that fooli&s;h <HI>Babel-Building-Age</HI> I &s;peak of: In the old World we found, that, at lea&s;t for a time, Men began to call on the Name of the Lord; and the Patriarchs of that Age were famous for Piety, of whom 'tis &s;aid, as particularly of <HI>Enoch,</HI> that <HI>he walked with God</HI>: an emphatic &s;ignificant Expre&s;&s;ion, which our learned Commentators have &s;pent a great deal of Time in expatiating upon and explain|ing. The Scripture again expre&s;&s;es this walking with God to be an Act of Faith, and quotes it, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. <HI>ver.</HI> 5. as a glorious Example of &s;uch Faith as was rewarded with an immediate Tran&s;lation of the Per&s;on into Heaven. <HI>He was not, for GOD took him</HI>; and from which the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely and ac|compli&s;htly whim&s;ical Mr. <HI>A&s;gill</HI> form'd his new Sy&s;tem of going the neare&s;t way (Home) <HI>to Hea|ven</HI> by the farthe&s;t way about, a fiery Chariot in|&s;tead of dying; as if the former were not a Change as well as the <HI>latter,</HI> and as if Heaven had not al|ready made the be&s;t Choice for us: But tho' he &s;uf|fer'd Martyrdom for his Scheme (having been ex|pell'd

<P>But to return to the <HI>Antediluveans:</HI> The old World, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> as wicked as they were, had &s;ome &s;hadow of Good in them, and for &s;ome Years, nay &s;ome hun|dreds of Years, they maintain'd the Character of the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> before they were debauched by the <HI>Daughters of Men</HI>; that is to &s;ay, before they blended the Race with the corrupt Seed of <HI>Cain,</HI> and mingled Blood with Idolaters. Where, by the way, we have an accurate De&s;cription of the Times, I mean in tho&s;e early Days, of the Race; 'tis evident 'twas ju&s;t then as 'tis now, the <HI>Ladies</HI> were the Devils of the Age; the Beauties, the Toa&s;ts, the fine Faces were the Baits; the Hell lay concealed in the Smiles of the charming Sex, They were the <HI>Magicians,</HI> taking the Word in its pre&s;ent Accepta|tion and its gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sen&s;e: There lay the Witch|craft, and its Force was &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that it drew in even the Sons of God, ju&s;t, in a word, as it does now, and of which I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak again at large as we go on.&mdash;In the mean time, I de&s;cend with the Story to the next Gene|ration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antediluveans</HI> might have &s;omething of Re|ligion in them, however fatally mix'd with Crime; but as for the new Good-for-nothing Race, we hardly read of any thing that ever was to be found among them that may be called valuable, from <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf downward; and even <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf, we all know, fell into the Debaucheries of Wine, and if you will believe Tradition, continued in it a hundred Years.

<P>It is worth ob&s;erving here indeed, were it not too grave for your Reading, how effectually <HI>Noah</HI> by the horrid Defection of his own Morals in that One Act of <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> I &s;ay how effectually he &s;hut the Door again&s;t the Force of all his Own future In|&s;tructions: He was till then indeed a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and had been &s;o to the Antediluvean World for near &s;ix hundred Years; but after that, he might preach indeed if he would, but what Re|gard would he obtain, when the debauch'd In&s;tructor had expos'd him&s;elf by his Drunkenne&s;s to the Ri|dicule in&s;tead of the Reverence of his Po&s;terity, and when the drunken Monitor by his own Pra|ctice had render'd his In&s;tructions fruitle&s;s and ridi|culous?</P>
<P>How ju&s;tly might they bid him hold his Tongue, and go and reform his Life, before he pretended to in&s;truct them? bid him fir&s;t learn the Precepts he taught, and &s;how them by his Example what it was he would have them practi&s;e? How might they

upbraid him with exhorting them to be &s;ober, while he went drunk to bed? exhorting them to Mode&s;ty and Virtue, while he appear'd in the mo&s;t &s;candalous manner, lying drunk in his Tent, and his Nakedne&s;s expos'd to the Banter and im|pious Je&s;t of his Grand&s;on <HI>Ham?</HI></P>
<P>How mu&s;t it cover his Face with Blu&s;hes, to find he had di&s;honoured by his Example the Doctrine of Sobriety which he had preached to his Children, who were thereby brought to mock him, rather than to li&s;ten to him, and to make Ballads of him, rather than copy his Precept for their Imitation?</P>
<P>But I &s;ay this is a Subject too &s;olemn for the Age, and you will pre&s;ently tell me I am going to write a Comment upon the ninth Chapter of <HI>Ge|ne&s;is.</HI> So I leave it for you to con&s;ider of, and re|turn to the Chronology of early Wickedne&s;s in the Po&s;t-diluvean World.</P>
<P><HI>Noah</HI> being thus di&s;abled, by his own falling into Crime, from in&s;tructing his Po&s;terity, what was the Con&s;equence? he liv'd to &s;ee them run headlong into that wor&s;t of all Crimes, <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and the Wor&s;hip of GOD &s;unk <HI>as it were</HI> out of the World, even in his own time, and before his Eyes.</P>
<P>This is evident from <HI>Abraham,</HI> whom the Scripture acknowledges to have been not an Idolater only, but even bred up in <HI>Idolatry</HI> while he lived in <HI>Me|&s;opotamia</HI>; and 'tis certain <HI>Abraham</HI> was born above fifty Years before <HI>Noah</HI> died: So that <HI>Noah</HI> liv'd to &s;ee his Po&s;terity degenerated into Idolatry, not all his Preaching or Practice being able to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een all the Wickedne&s;s of the old World revived in its new Inhabitants, without the Wit and Capacities which they had before; and the Race being thus entirely degenerated, we mu&s;t be|gin all our hi&s;torical Account of them with taking them ju&s;t as we find them, and that will bring us directly to the Subject I propo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29">The Race being thus, as I have &s;aid, &s;tript naked of the Beauties of their Ance&s;tors, whether in Mat|ters of Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding, or in Matters of Piety and Religion, and running on into all man|ner of fooli&s;h and &s;imple as well as wicked Exce&s;&s;es, it is not at all wonderful if when any particular Per|&s;on appeared more than ordinary knowing, or but a Lover of and Searcher after Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, &s;uch a Per&s;on was honoured in a more than ordinary manner, was reverenced as an extra|ordinary Man, exalted in the common E&s;teem when alive, and perhaps placed among the Stars after his Death; that he who &s;hined in their E&s;teem when living, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be made immor|tal at his Death, and to be exalted to &s;hine in a higher Orbit.</P>
<P>Hence it became a vulgar Error among the fir&s;t Ages, but was riveted &s;o fa&s;t in the Minds of Men, that nothing could per&s;wade them not to believe it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Stars were all the tran&s;parent bright Souls of their wi&s;e Ance&s;tors, who for their Virtue and Wi&s;dom were exalted by the immortal Powers to a Station of Glory, and were made to &s;hine in that manner for the farther enlightning the World, to whom they had been &s;o beneficent when they were here; and from hence it came at la&s;t that all their great Men, and e&s;pecially their Kings, were thus reverenced and exalted, whether they were good Men or no.</P>

then, as it is now; whether there was due Encouragement given for the Search, or whe|ther Wit went threadbare and in Rags, as it does &s;ince; Authors are not agreed upon it indeed, and it may be hard to bring them to a Point: It is true, later and more modern Philo&s;ophers learned to de|&s;pi&s;e Money, and <HI>Solon</HI> preferred Wi&s;dom and a retired Life to the Wealth of <HI>Croe&s;us</HI>; but in the more early Times of the World, the Knowledge of Nature and the Study of Wi&s;dom as it went then, &s;eemed to be a communicative Good, which therefore as they that reaped the Benefit of it ought to pay for and did &s;o, &s;o their <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> grew (in time) mercenary and mean, as in other Places.</P>
<P>This leads me to the Times when the primitive Wi&s;dom of tho&s;e early Days beginning, as I &s;aid, to be more common, and that the <HI>Magi</HI> had com|municated much of their Knowledge to the com|mon People.

<P>By this Study they obtained the Name of <HI>South|&s;ayers</HI> and <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> added to that of <HI>Magicians,</HI> which they had before: and on the foot of the&s;e Studies they interpreted Dreams, explain'd good and bad Omens, foretold Events, and perhaps play'd &s;ome Leger-de-main Tricks too, to impo&s;e upon the World, as their worthy Succe&s;&s;ors do to this Day; and in a word, 'tis likely they did all tho&s;e things then, which the&s;e People do now, of whom we &s;ay with more Freedom perhaps than Truth, that they deal with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>

old Gentleman; nor, if I under&s;tand how the Ca&s;e &s;tood with Satan at that time, had he any man|ner of Occa&s;ion for them, but did his Bu&s;ine&s;s quite another way; for the Devil had Altars and Temples of <HI>his own,</HI> was another kind of a King in tho&s;e Days than he has appeared to be &s;ince: THEN he gave Audience in form of <HI>a Deity,</HI> and &s;aw him&s;elf wor&s;hipped like a God almo&s;t throughout the whole World: Here, under the Name of <HI>Baal</HI>; there, <HI>Mo|loch</HI>; here in one manner, there in another: Nor had the GOD of Heaven One Temple in the World, when the Devil had a great many &s;catter'd here and there, almo&s;t in every Nation. I a&s;&s;ure you, however modern Writers think fit to repre|&s;ent him, he &s;corn'd in tho&s;e days to go about like a poor &s;habby Out-at-heels Devil, as he has done &s;ince, and may perhaps do now. No, He appeared in State, and as he u&s;urped divine Honours, &s;o he made a Figure &s;uitable to his U&s;urpation, and had his Shrines and his Votaries, his Prie&s;ts and his Places of Wor&s;hip, in whatever Shapes or Places he pleas'd to be wor&s;hipp'd in: Thus as <HI>Dagon</HI> he had a Hou&s;e of &s;olemn Wor&s;hip at <HI>A&s;hdod,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> v.2. and as <HI>Baalzebub</HI> at <HI>Ekron,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Now as the Devil had thus the Government of the whole World in his own Hand, and that he was almo&s;t in the very Letter of it <HI>the God of the World,</HI> &s;o he had no need at that time to employ &s;ecret Agents, and work by way of Familiars or private Intelligence, as he does &s;ince; nor, to do the <HI>ho|ne&s;t Men</HI> Ju&s;tice, had any of the <HI>South&s;ayers</HI> and <HI>Magicians,</HI> and tho&s;e which were at fir&s;t called their <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> any Conver&s;ation with the Devil at all, no, or with any of his Works, they carried on no Bu&s;ine&s;s for him.</P>
<P>But they were Men of Thought, or if you plea&s;e, Men of deeper thinking than the ordinary &s;ort: They &s;tudied the Sciences, and enquired into u&s;eful

things, &s;earched the Works of Nature and Provi|dence, &s;tudied the Meaning and End of things, the Cau&s;es and Events, and con&s;equently were able to &s;ee farther into the ordinary Cour&s;e and Cau&s;es both of things about them, and things above them, <HI>than other Men.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;tudy of A&s;tronomy, they &s;oon found the &s;ecret Influences of the Stars upon the Surface of the Earth, upon Plants and Animals, nay, upon both Man and Bea&s;t: as for Example, How the Growth and Virtues of earthly Bodies were guided and govern'd by the heavenly, and how even the Events of the greate&s;t moment on Earth often|times obey'd the Force of tho&s;e heavenly Bodies; their Conjunctions, Oppo&s;itions, near or remote Po&s;itions, Revolutions and Appearances; and ac|cordingly they were capable of making &s;uch pro|bable Conjectures of things not yet come to pa&s;s, as were amazing and &s;urprizing to the re&s;t of the World; and by which they took them, either for Men fill'd with &s;acred Knowledge, and that tho&s;e things were communicated to them immediately from Heaven; or that, however they got it, they had a prophetick Knowledge of what &s;hould come to pa&s;s, and could foretel Events even before the apparent Cau&s;es were ordinarily known.</P>
<P>This gave the common People an extraordinary Veneration for the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> as they had an awful Notion of their exceeding Wi&s;dom and Knowledge.

<P>The&s;e were the <HI>Magicians</HI> of the fir&s;t Ages of the World, and &s;uch was the Opinion which the People had of them in tho&s;e days; not that they were Conjurers, or <HI>cunning Men,</HI> or &s;uch &s;ort of People as we now call them; but were Men, who at that time knew more than the ordinary rate of Knowledge in&s;tructed others to know; and were endued from Heaven with extraordinary Degrees of Wi&s;dom above other Men. Nor was the Re|&s;pect paid to them equal, but more or le&s;s in de|gree, according to the particular Degrees of &s;a|cred In&s;piration which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have.

<P>Now 'tis true, we have only Examples of the Kings and Princes making u&s;e of the&s;e People in difficult Ca&s;es, as <HI>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Bel|&s;hazzar.</HI> But 'tis not to be doubted, that the Peo|ple in general, of all Qualities and Conditions, went to them to be re&s;olv'd in their Doubts, and to have Que&s;tions an&s;wer'd them in difficult Ca&s;es; in &s;hort this was their general Employment, and they made a Trade of it.</P>

<P>All things in Nature are great or little in their Appearances, in Proportion to tho&s;e proper Ob|jects which they are to be con&s;ider'd with, or mea&s;ur'd by. The Earth it &s;elf is con&s;ider'd as a va&s;t Globe of &s;olid Sub&s;tances, form'd into one Body by an infinitely powerful Hand; when on the one hand it is mea&s;ur'd by any particular Bodies, either Part of it &s;elf, or of any other Body, which are &s;mall, and as it may be &s;aid incon&s;iderable in Bulk compar'd to it: Whereas on the other hand, that very Globe or va&s;t Body which we call this <HI>Earth,</HI> is but as a Point, a Mote, or a grain of
<PB N="28" REF="41">
Du&s;t, when con&s;ider'd with and mea&s;ur'd by the immen&s;e Bodies of the Comets, the Sun, the fix'd Stars, or other tho&s;e glorious Luminaries which we &s;ee rang'd above us, and out of the reach even almo&s;t of our Conceptions.</P>
<P>Thus the Knowledge and Acquirement of the <HI>Magicians</HI> and wi&s;e Men in the fir&s;t Ages of Time, and of whom I have been now &s;peaking, tho' mean and trifling, &s;uperficial, and of little Worth, when compar'd with the accompli&s;h'd, and con|&s;ummate Wi&s;dom of the Moderns, their experi|mental Philo&s;ophy, their Knowledge in A&s;tronomy, their Improvement of Nature and Art; yet it was Great, and worthy of Admiration, when compar'd in tho&s;e Days, to what the re&s;t of Mankind knew, and look'd upon by, and compar'd with an ignorant Age &s;uch as that was; and therefore the King tells <HI>Da|niel,</HI> that an <HI>Excellent Spirit of Wi&s;dom was found in him.</HI> Dan. v. 14. And doubtle&s;s the People look'd upon <HI>Daniel</HI> to be in&s;pir'd with Wi&s;dom and Know|ledge from the <HI>holy Gods,</HI> that is to &s;ay from Hea|ven, <HI>as indeed he was,</HI> tho' not from their dumb Idols, whom they called by the Name of the <HI>Holy Gods.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, tho' perhaps not with &s;o &s;trong a Conviction, they had an Opinion of all tho&s;e they call'd the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>South&s;ayers, Magici|cians</HI> and <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> that they had &s;ecret Commu|nication with their Gods, and that they receiv'd all the Knowledge with which they were in&s;pir'd, and in which they &s;o much excell'd the re&s;t of Mankind, from the &s;everal Deities which they wor|&s;hipp'd. I will not deny but that tho&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> might endeavour by many Subtilties and Arts, to confirm and pre&s;erve the delu&s;ion (for they knew it to be &s;o) in the Minds of the People; that they might al&s;o work up the Veneration of the deluded Multitude to a due Height, and pre&s;erve the Opi|nion
<PB N="29" REF="42">
both of their Per&s;ons and of their Capacities; and this perhaps will appear, when further enquir'd into, to be the Foundation of all the wicked things which follow'd, as I &s;hall demon&s;trate in its Order.</P>
<P>It was really a Temptation to tho&s;e <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> as they were called, to &s;ee that the World had a va&s;t Opinion of them; while the World was blind, and in the Infancy of their own Under&s;tanding, a little matter would impo&s;e upon them; but in pro|ce&s;s of things the World grew wi&s;er, and the light Nature began to receive Illuminations from the light of Rea&s;on, and then it behov'd the wi&s;e Men to &s;ee that their Knowledge al&s;o encrea&s;ed in Pro|portion; for &s;till they were obliged to keep the Reputation of their Under&s;tandings, by pa&s;&s;ing from one Study to another, and a&s;piring &s;till high|er and higher in their &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es of Improve|ment.</P>
<P>Now this it was ea&s;ie to do, in all tho&s;e early Days of Knowledge. Nay, they had a thou&s;and Years before them &s;till, in which a moderate Com|petence of acquir'd Knowledge would keep up their Characters; what Cour&s;e was taken afterwards we &s;hall &s;ee by and by.</P>
<P>To &s;um it up then in few Words; a <HI>Magician</HI> in the fir&s;t Ages of the World was nothing more or le&s;s than a Man of Learning; only you mu&s;t take this with you as you go, that by the Word <HI>Learning</HI> is to be under&s;tood not a Man of <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Books,</HI> for the World knew little of either in the fir&s;t Days of tho&s;e Acquirements. Nay, we have rea|&s;on to be a&s;&s;ur'd, that the Knowledge of Letters was not arriv'd in the World, at the time when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;ummon'd the wi&s;e Men, and the South|&s;ayers, and Magicians to interpret his Dream; and as they had no Letters, they had no Books; and therefore when 'tis &s;aid that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was learned in

<P>The Magicians, I &s;ay, were Men of Learning that is to &s;ay Men of Study, Men of Ob&s;ervation bu&s;y in the &s;earch after Knowledge; and if we wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> take Pains to enquire into it, we &s;hall find thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ob&s;ervations chiefly re&s;pected the Motions of the heavenly Bodies, the A&s;pects and Influences of the Planets and fix'd Stars; and con&s;idering that they were ab&s;olutely without the help of In&s;trument and Gla&s;&s;es to make their Ob&s;ervations by, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without Books, by which to communicate the Knowledge of one Age, or of one Per&s;on, to an|other; I &s;ay, con&s;idering the&s;e things were want|ing, 'tis a wonderful thing that they arriv'd to &s;uch a Degree of a&s;tronomical Knowledge as they did.</P>
<P>Others &s;tudied the Knowledge of Nature, in the Con&s;titution and Contexture of human Bodies; the Originals, the Progre&s;s, and the cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;tempers, both in Men and Women; and al&s;o the phy&s;ical or medicinal Virtue of Drugs and Plants, for Cure and Ea&s;e of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es; the qualities of the &s;everal Herbs and Trees, and Pro|ductions of the Earth; and as in the&s;e things they made daily Di&s;coveries in Nature, which the World was till then ignorant of, and by which they perform'd &s;urprizing Cures, and deliver'd the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People in divers Maladies, they were on that Account, and de&s;ervedly too, had in great E&s;teem, were reve|renc'd, and even wor&s;hip'd by the People.</P>
<P>I could give many Examples in Hi&s;tory from the mo&s;t ancient Times, when their Phy&s;icians and A|&s;tronomers were, after their Decea&s;e, rank'd among their Gods, and doubtle&s;s were had in a profound Veneration, while they were living.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="44">In a word, Science and u&s;eful Knowledge being young in the World, tho&s;e Men who gave them|&s;elves up to the fir&s;t Searches after tho&s;e things, were thought worthy of the greate&s;t Honours, and were had in the greate&s;t E&s;teem; indeed they very well de&s;erv'd of Mankind, &s;ince they gave &s;uch noble Te&s;timonies of their being devoted to the Publick good.

<P>This is that <HI>Prometheus,</HI> who for his exqui&s;ite Knowledge, is feign'd by the Poets to have fir&s;t form'd Man, that is to &s;ay, form'd the Model of a Man by the help of Water and Earth; and then &s;tole Fire from the Sun to animate the Model, and to give him Life and Motion.</P>

<P>But to leave Moralizing, which my merry Rea|ders &s;eem to have an Aver&s;ion to, I go on with my Story.</P>
<P>The learned Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> &s;ays, they are greatly mi&s;taken who think that the Thing as well as the Word <HI>Magick</HI> is derived from <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> He adds, that <HI>Simon</HI>'s Name was not <HI>Magus,</HI> a Ma|gician, but <HI>Goes,</HI> a Per&s;on familiar with evil Spirits, and that he only u&s;urp'd the Title of <HI>Simon the Magician,</HI> becau&s;e the Title of a <HI>Magician</HI> was honou|rable and good; and my Opinion is thus &s;trengthen'd by his Authority, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is a manife&s;t dif|ference between <HI>Magick,</HI> which is Wi&s;dom and
<PB N="33" REF="48">
&s;upernatural Knowledge, and the Witchery and Con|juring by which we now under&s;tand the Word, and u&s;e it accordingly.</P>
<P>I join with this Expo&s;ition of the Word <HI>Magick,</HI> and &s;hall therefore carefully di&s;tingui&s;h as I go a|long betwixt the &s;everal differing Per&s;ons known in Hi&s;tory for <HI>Magi, Magicians,</HI> and Profe&s;&s;ors or Practi&s;ers of <HI>Magick</HI>; and tho&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> by which we are to under&s;tand Sorcerers, and Enchanters, and Dealers with the Devil, of whom neverthele&s;s I &s;hall have occa&s;ion frequently to &s;peak in this Work; becau&s;e, though I &s;hall let you know that the <HI>Magicians</HI> were not all Sorcerers and Devil-Dealers, yet I mu&s;t al&s;o let you know too, that I am to point the main of this Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;uch as are &s;o.</P>
<P>Nor is this previous determining the Point any thing le&s;s than nece&s;&s;ary at this time, with re&s;pect to the Variety of worthy Gentlemen, our pre&s;ent Contemporaries in fa&s;hionable Wi&s;dom; who, how|ever willing they are to be taken for <HI>Magicians,</HI> even in the very wor&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, rather than not to pa&s;s for Conjurers, mu&s;t be vindicated even again&s;t their Wills, if it be only upon the &s;ingle Con&s;ideration of Incapacity; &s;ince as none of the <HI>Magi</HI> of the World were famed for want|ing Brains, &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> having no occa&s;ion for Fools in the natural Sen&s;e, will always di&s;own them, in &s;pite of the &s;tronge&s;t Pretences they make to his Service.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice therefore to tho&s;e <HI>Wou'd-be-witches,</HI> I mu&s;t clear the way as I go, and openly di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Magicians,</HI> under&s;tanding them as wi&s;e and learned Men; or <HI>Magicians,</HI> under&s;tanding them as Black-Art Men; and FOOLS, that are only not <HI>Sor|cerers</HI> becau&s;e the Devil does not think it worth his while to employ them; and in &s;hort, that they are incapable of being as wicked as they would be.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="49">The Word <HI>Magus,</HI> from whence the Words <HI>Magick</HI> and <HI>Magician</HI> are derived, is a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or perhaps <HI>Chaldean</HI> Term, u&s;ed originally to &s;ignify a Student in Divinity, a Man conver&s;ant in divine Studies; and <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays the Art of <HI>Magick</HI> is nothing but the Knowledge of the Wor&s;hip of the Gods, and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> called their Gods <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; which Ex|po&s;ition of the Word is agreeable to that of <HI>Mat.</HI> ii.2. there came <HI>wi&s;e Men of the Ea&s;t,</HI> who having &s;een the Star of him that was born King of the <HI>Jews,</HI> came &s;o far <HI>to wor&s;hip him.</HI></P>

Mi&s;chief, as &s;ome call them; the&s;e are the kind I am to treat of, who are Workers of Evil by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an evil Spirit; and the la&s;t are called <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> by which are under&s;tood Foretellers of things to come, who under&s;tand their hidden and &s;ecret Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>This Expo&s;ition brings us down to the Ca&s;e in hand, where by the Word or Term of <HI>Magick</HI> is under&s;tood the two la&s;t &s;orts, who working Evil of &s;everal kinds, do it al&s;o by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an evil Spirit; that is in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by the Help of the Devil, by Inchantment, Conjurations, and corrupt Methods.</P>
<P>The Practices of the&s;e People were many ways Diabolical, even in tho&s;e days; and if we may cre|dit King <HI>James</HI>'s Account of them, they were ra|ther wor&s;e in tho&s;e latter Ages of the World than in former times; but of that in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>Philo Judaeus</HI> carries it further than any of the mo&s;t antient Writers and Sages, and &s;ays that by this kind of <HI>Magick,</HI> that is by <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> and Ob&s;ervation of the heavenly Bodies, their Motions, and Revolutions, <HI>Abraham,</HI> who was certainly a very great <HI>Magician,</HI> arriv'd to the Knowledge of the true GOD; even be|fore he came out from UR <HI>of the Chaldees</HI>; that is to &s;ay, he gather'd from the wi&s;e Government, the won|derful Order and Motion, and the immovable De|crees and Revolutions of the heavenly Bodies, that there mu&s;t be an infinite, wi&s;e, and intelli|gent Being, who, as he was the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of their Beings, &s;o he was likewi&s;e the great Director of their Motions, and by his Appointment every thing in the whole Sy&s;tem of their Operations was guid|ed and appointed: In &s;hort, that <HI>Abraham</HI> learn'd to know the Creator, by the Contemplation of the Creature. And doubtle&s;s as this &s;tudy of Nature directly leads us to the great Author of Nature, &s;o <HI>Abraham</HI> by his &s;incere Application to the fir&s;t,
<PB N="36" REF="51">
and his &s;incere De&s;ire to be led into the Number of the la&s;t; GOD, who knew tho&s;e De&s;ires of his Heart to be &s;incere, and aiming at a right end, was plea|&s;ed to make a more clear Di&s;covery of him&s;elf to him by Vi&s;ion and Revelation; teaching him more than he could ever have obtain'd by all the Study and Application imaginable.</P>
<P>It is not doubted however that <HI>Abraham</HI> was the fir&s;t teacher of A&s;tronomy and of Arithmetick in the World, and perhaps of the &s;everal Branches of the Mathematicks; The Ancients affirm, that he taught the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> that is to &s;ay the <HI>Cana|anites</HI> among whom he liv'd, and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> al&s;o, all the Knowledge they had, whether Philo&s;ophi|cal or Divine.</P>
<P>Thus then, whatever Notions we have now en|tertain'd of <HI>Magick</HI> as Diabolical, yet certainly, as our Saviour &s;ays in another Ca&s;e, <HI>in the beginning it was not &s;o.</HI> In the fir&s;t Ages of the World, the Know|ledge of <HI>Magick</HI> was the Wi&s;dom of Nature; and nothing but Ignorance brought Men to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to the Devil for the encrea&s;e of their Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>And this indeed is the way by which <HI>Magick,</HI> and the Knowledge of the mo&s;t excellent things, has been abus'd in the World; when Men &s;eeking be|yond them&s;elves for Knowledge, and ignorant of the way to increa&s;e true Knowledge, have been impos'd upon to make u&s;e of wicked and diabo|lical Methods to obtain it; the Devil not only readily concurring to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, but openly acting with them by Concert, to encourage the De|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hence the weake&s;t and mo&s;t impotent of all Capacities, meer Fools excepted, have been found &s;ufficient to make Tools for the Devil; who hard+ening them for his own Work, trains them up to his Hand, with &s;uch an unwearied Diligence, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="37" REF="52">
nothing can prevent their improving in his Ser|vice.</P>
<P>Thus while <HI>Magick</HI> is the Wi&s;dom of Nature, and the <HI>Magicians</HI> of tho&s;e Ages were the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Men; the <HI>Magicians</HI> of our times, and of this new kind, improve from nothing, begin with the vile&s;t of Ignorance, and proceed to the vile&s;t of Wickedne&s;s, till they come to be the mo&s;t Diabolical Creatures in the World.</P>
<P>Magick being therefore nothing in tho&s;e Times, but, as I have &s;aid, a degree of u&s;eful Knowledge, and the <HI>Magicians</HI> being a Race of hone&s;t &s;tudious Men, &s;earching after Wi&s;dom, and ble&s;t with greater Shares of it, than the ordinary Race of Men were arriv'd to; we mu&s;t look farther, and come down lower into Time, for the pre&s;ent vulgar Ac|ceptation of the Word: In which Inquiry, it will not be &s;ufficient to jump at once from the beginning of things to the pre&s;ent times, and from what the <HI>Magicians</HI> were in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Chaldea,</HI> to what they are now in a Chri&s;tian Age: But we mu&s;t a little enquire into the Gradations of the Change, and &s;ee by what &s;everal Progre&s;&s;ions of Art the u&s;eful <HI>Magicians</HI> of tho&s;e Ages have come on, from meer Philo&s;ophy, to all the Extraordi|naries of My&s;tery, Cunning, Trick, Cheat, Star|gazing, Fortune-telling, Conjuring, Witchcraft, and the Devil; and if this be not an Enquiry, both profitable and diverting, I mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in my Subject, or in my Readers.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Wi&s;dom and Learning advanc'd Men in the Fir&s;t Ages to Royalty and Government, and How Many of the Magicians were made Kings on that Account; as <HI>Zoroa&s;ter, Cad|mus,</HI> and many others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was not many Ages that the World conti|nued in a &s;tate of Dullne&s;s, equal to that at the fir&s;t &s;cattering the Nations. We do not find them building any more <HI>Babels,</HI> or entertaining them|&s;elves with &s;uch gro&s;s Notions any more.</P>
<P>As they travell'd abroad they learned Experience; they &s;aw farther into Nature, and into the Rea&s;on of Things: in&s;tead of building Ladders and <HI>Babels</HI> to reach up to Heaven, and keep them from drowning, they &s;oon learnt to build Cities to keep out their Enemies, and Ships to &s;ail upon the Water; they baffled the Fears of another Deluge not by their Faith, that God would not drown the World again, &s;o much as by the belief of this Whym&s;y, that &s;eeing they could &s;wim in Ships and Boats, he could not do it; or that knowing they could live upon the Water, they might &s;eem not to care whether he did or no.</P>
<P>In this travelling Circum&s;tance they grew in Knowledge, as I &s;ay, and <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> &s;ome of them being of a brighter Genius than others, advanc'd beyond their Neighbours in Wi&s;dom and Under|&s;tanding both &s;peculative and practical; and the&s;e, as they gain'd every Day more Knowledge, even by knowing, &s;o that Knowledge gain'd them infinite Applau&s;e and E&s;teem among the People.</P>
<P>Hence every a&s;piring Genius among them get|ting the &s;tart of the re&s;t, either in real or affected Knowledge of things, and thereby gaining Ad|mirers and Dependents, took little differing Routs
<PB N="39" REF="54">
in their Wanderings; and wherever they thought fit to plant and &s;ettle, they built Hou&s;es, call'd it a City, and the Leader made him&s;elf be call'd their particular King.</P>
<P>This petty Royalty, as it was rais'd upon the foot of Chance, rather than Blood, and upon the mean Circum&s;tance of a bold a&s;piring Head, which a &s;mall &s;hare of Brains above its Neighbours gave a Title to, &s;o it &s;eem'd to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the foot of the &s;ame Chance; tho&s;e Kings being as ea&s;ily, and as often depos'd, as they were either over-power'd by their Neighbours, or as any Decay and Defect of the bright Part that rais'd them, caus'd them to &s;ink in the Opinion of their Subjects, and gave the King of the next City a better Place in their Favour.</P>
<P>Yet this Diminutive Rank of Soveraignty re|main'd many Ages in the World; and we find, not only in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time, when the five Cities of the Lake or Valley, where <HI>Sodom</HI> &s;tood, had five Kings over them; and afterwards in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s time, the City of <HI>Sichem</HI> had a King over it; but even at the coming of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> into <HI>Canaan,</HI> almo&s;t every City had its King; and we have a great deal of room to judge, that the&s;e Kings did not derive from a patriarchal Succe&s;&s;ion, for then there would have been many thou&s;ands of Kings more than there were; but from the exalted Merit of the Under|&s;tandings and Genius of &s;uch and &s;uch a Per&s;on, whom the People thought fit to admire and follow, and con&s;equently &s;ubject them&s;elves to: and we have abundance of Examples in Hi&s;tory to prove, that this was the practice of tho&s;e fir&s;t Ages. But this is a dry Study, and the Search after their Names would be as needle&s;s, as the Li&s;t, when obtain'd, would be tedious to read; &s;o I leave it, and go on.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of my naming this Part, is not to &s;how the Veneration the mo&s;t early Ages of the World had for Wi&s;dom and Virtue; for, <HI>God knows,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Magi,</HI> tho' they had the Merit of &s;ome
<PB N="40" REF="55">
Knowledge above the re&s;t, yet we do not find they had a much greater Share of Virtue than o|ther People: But even as we find it now, the mo&s;t knowing Men are not the be&s;t Men; even &s;o it was then, every wi&s;e Man, much le&s;s every great Man, was not a good Man: and as in our Age it may be fear'd, we have more Clergy than Chri|&s;tians; &s;o there were in tho&s;e Days more Sages than Saints: till at la&s;t their wi&s;e Men turn'd whim&s;ical, their Kings Madmen, their South&s;ayers meer Conjurers, and their Magicians Devils: Of all which I &s;hall give a farther Account pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I'll &s;uppo&s;e now, that the <HI>Magicians</HI> of tho&s;e Ages were, as I have de&s;crib'd them in the Chapter before, nothing but Men fam'd for extraordinary Knowledge; meer A&s;trologers, Philo&s;ophers, Men of Study, and the like. You will next &s;ee how tho&s;e Men frequently rais'd their Fortunes by their Wi&s;dom, or rather by the Opinion which the ignorant World had of their Wi&s;dom and Ca|pacities.</P>
<P><HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> was a famous <HI>Magician,</HI> in the Sen&s;e which I have already given of the word. Hi&s;tory tells us, he was a great A&s;trologer, and foretold things by his Art, which were to come; that by his wonderful Predictions, he obtain'd &s;uch a Vene|ration among the People, that the <HI>Bactrians</HI> ador'd him as a Man &s;ent down from the Gods, or if you like it as well in Scripture Terms, as a <HI>Man of GOD</HI>; and by this mighty Opinion which they had of him, he obtain'd the Empire of the <HI>Bactrians.</HI> This mu&s;t be at the time when <HI>Ninus</HI> was Monarch of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>; for he was afterwards conquer'd, di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of his Dominions, and &s;lain by <HI>Semiramis,</HI> that warlike Widow Queen of <HI>A&s;&s;yria.</HI></P>
<P>They report that he foretold he &s;hould be &s;lain by Lightning, or by the Fire of Heaven; and that he told the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> that if they could find his A&s;hes, they &s;hould carefully pre&s;erve them, for
<PB N="41" REF="56">
that their Empire &s;hould continue no longer than while his A&s;hes &s;hould remain in Being; that after|ward it fell out accordingly, that he was kill'd by Lightning, and that the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> did &s;o pre&s;erve his A&s;hes, but that they were afterwards taken from them by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who overthrew their Empire.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> All this is &s;umm'd up thus in fact; That <HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> left behind him whol&s;ome Rules of Virtue and good Government, which as long as the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> kept in Memory, and wor|thily follow'd, they were pro&s;perous, as he foretold them they would be; but when af|terwards they degenerated into Vice, and cea&s;ed to obey the Rules which he had &s;et them, they fell into Divi&s;ions and Factions, Civil Wars and Deva&s;tations, which at length ended in the Ruin of their Empire.</P>
<P><HI>Cadmus,</HI> mention'd before, was a <HI>Phoenician,</HI> but went from his own Country and &s;ettled in <HI>Greece,</HI> where, as they &s;ay, he built the City of <HI>Thebes,</HI> and was made King of it, in con&s;equence of the Performance, and in Veneration of his Learning, having brought &s;ixteen Letters of the <HI>Greek</HI> Alpha|bet among them; not that he invented tho&s;e Let|ters, tho' he has the Fame of it to this Day: the Letters were the&s;e; &agr;, &bgr;, &ggr;, &dgr;, &egr;, &igr;, &eegr;, &kgr;, &lgr;, &ngr;, &ogr;, &pgr;, &zgr;, &sgr;, &tgr;, &ugr;; the other four &thgr;, &xgr;, &phgr;, &khgr;, they tell us were afterwards &s;upply'd by <HI>Palamedes</HI> during the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>But the Moral of the Story is this, that <HI>Cadmus</HI> came from <HI>Phoenicia</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> where by his Learning he in&s;tructed the People, civiliz'd and poli&s;h'd their Manners, and taught them the Knowldge of Letters; directed them to build Hou&s;es, and inhabit together in Towns and Vil|lages, which they then called Cities; and, in a word, introduc'd among them Di&s;cipline and good

or <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> were called in to &s;upport the Govern|ment of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire: And here they &s;hew'd indeed, that Wi&s;dom is not the only Qualification of a Prince; that there is another thing requi&s;ite, which tho' it is but trifling indeed among the Moderns, was an E&s;&s;ential among the Ancients, who found, that to make a good Governor, it was requi&s;ite, that he &s;hould not only be a Wi&s;e Man, but an Hone&s;t Man; and in defect of this Qualification, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> cut the Throats of all the <HI>Magi,</HI> to whom they had committed the Government of the Country; for tho' they were all Philo&s;ophers, and wi&s;e Men, yet, as Fame hands it down to us, they did not find one hone&s;t Man among them.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Magi</HI> are called by &s;ome Prie&s;ts, by others Philo&s;ophers, by others A&s;trologers; it is certain they foretold things to come, or at lea&s;t made the People believe &s;o; as in the Ca&s;e of the Queen of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> Mother of King <HI>Sapores.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> it &s;eems were in great Perplexity for want of a King, (there were no <HI>Pretenders</HI> at that time to put in their Claim) a thing which very &s;eldom happens in our times: The Nobility being a&s;&s;em|bled, in order to con&s;ider of a Nomination, the <HI>Magi</HI> &s;ent them word that they &s;hould not pro|ceed, for that the Queen Dowager was with Child, and would bring forth a Prince, who &s;hould be a mighty King, and do great things for the Honour of his Country.</P>
<P>Upon this their Con&s;ultations broke off, and with great Joy they &s;ent for the Queen, and laying the Crown upon her Belly, they &s;olemnly crown'd the Embrio, gave it the Title of King, and &s;aluted it King by the Name of <HI>Sapor,</HI> or <HI>Sapores</HI>; all which came to pa&s;s: And yet I may &s;ay all this might come to pa&s;s, and no great matter owing to the Pro|phetic Knowledge of the <HI>Magi</HI>; for the Queen, loth to have a King cho&s;en too &s;oon, before &s;he knew how

it was with her, might venture to &s;ay &s;he was with Child; or at lea&s;t get the Prie&s;ts, the <HI>Magi,</HI> to &s;ay &s;o for her, and leave the re&s;t all to Fate; for if it had not prov'd &s;o, no body was injur'd, and it would only have been &s;aid that the <HI>Magi</HI> were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But we are, if you plea&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e, that as I &s;aid, this did not la&s;t long; the low-priz'd Learn|ing of the <HI>Magicians</HI> an&s;wer'd very well, while the World was ignorant in Proportion; but as the World encrea&s;ed in People, and as Years went over their Heads, Knowledge had its Gradations too, and tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it was at a very &s;low Rate, yet &s;ome advances they did make; and as Princes &s;everally were lovers of Learning, &s;o they encouraged Men of Learning too, and their Num|bers encereas'd, as well as their Knowledge.</P>
<P>As the common People became more knowing and intelligent, &s;o it behov'd the <HI>Magicians</HI> to advance their Studies, and &s;eek farther into the more &s;ub|lime Parts of Learning, to pre&s;erve the Di&s;tance they &s;tood in, from the lower Cla&s;s of their Coun|trymen, and to maintain the Re&s;pect and Venera|tion which as I &s;aid the People had for them; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they had not done this, they had &s;oon been upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Level with the re&s;t of Mankind; the Rabbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been their Equals in Wi&s;dom, and they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lo&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;uperior Station of <HI>Magici+ans,</HI> which they enjoy'd before.</P>

<P><PB N="45" REF="60">Nor was this difficult to do; for as Knowledge was then, and even is &s;till, an unexhau&s;ted Mine and Store-hou&s;e of unvaluable Trea&s;ure, and which &s;till the deeper it is dug into, di&s;covers more and more Riches, and an infinite variety of Rarities and cu|rious things, as well natural as artificial; &s;o the farther the&s;e Men of Application &s;earch'd into the Arcana, or conceal'd Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom; and the farther and greater Experiments they made, the more they found the Search an&s;wer their utmo&s;t Ambition; the more they knew, the more they di&s;cover'd yet to know; and all their Enquiries made good the modern Di&s;tich made upon a like Subject.<Q><L>What's yet di&s;cover'd, only &s;erves to &s;how</L>

<P>This was not only an Encouragement to the <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> of the Ages we &s;peak of, to go on in their Studies, and in their making new Di&s;coveries in the hidden and mo&s;t retir'd parts of Nature; but it &s;hew'd that they were &s;till able to maintain the Characters they bore in the World, and to make good the Di&s;tinction which was formely made between them and the common People; &s;o that they &s;till pa&s;s'd for <HI>Magicians, wi&s;e Men,</HI> and A&s;trologers, as they really at la&s;t were; and for Men qualify'd to in|&s;truct the ignorant World in a &s;uperior Knowledge.</P>

<P>And this brings me down to the Point.</P>
<P>The Men of Wit and Learning being hard pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to it in their new Di&s;coveries, had but three ways to pre&s;erve the Dignity of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and keep up their Credit as <HI>wi&s;e Mine,</HI> that is as Philo|&s;ophers, <HI>Magi,</HI> and the like.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The fir&s;t was to pur&s;ue vigorou&s;ly the Study of Philo&s;ophy, that is to &s;ay of Nature, the &s;everal Branches of <HI>A&s;tronomy, A&s;trology, Geometry,</HI> and the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The &s;econd was to pu&s;h into the Study of Art, that is to &s;ay Experimental Philo&s;ophy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The la&s;t was the Study of Rea&s;on (<HI>viz.</HI>) Natu|ral Homage, and the Wor&s;hip of the Gods.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e they went on with great Succe&s;s; nor were they to be follow'd by the com|mon People, who&s;e Under&s;tandings could never come up to any uncommon degrees of Science, or indeed to make any Preten&s;ions to it; and therefore tho&s;e that apply'd to this Study, kept up their Credit longer than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus the three wi&s;e Men of the Ea&s;t are &s;aid to come into <HI>Judaea</HI> from a far Country, by ob&s;erving an unu&s;ual and &s;urprizing Phaenomenon, (<HI>viz.</HI>) a Star at Noon-day, moving in a particular Orbit, and pointing to them in a very particular Manner, by which they were as it &s;eems directed to follow it, in order to make an extraordinary Di&s;covery of &s;ome great Birth, and of &s;ome wonderful Prince,
<PB N="47" REF="62">
whom therefore they ought to come and pay Ho|mage to. Some Authors tell us, the&s;e three <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> or <HI>Magi,</HI> were three of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by <HI>Keturah</HI> his la&s;t Wife, that they dwelt in <HI>Ara|bia Felix,</HI> and that they had it revealed to them, that they &s;hould &s;ee this Star, and that they &s;hould be guided by it to &s;ee the Great <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> who was to come into the World to unite the Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in one Kingdom, which &s;hould rule over the whole World.

<P>But thus far 'tis to my Purpo&s;e, namely, that the Credit of the <HI>wi&s;e Men</HI> of the Ea&s;t was not yet quite &s;unk in the World; that they maintain'd a Corre&s;pondence with the Stars; that they por'd upon the heavenly Motions, and knew more of that kind than all that ever went before them.</P>
<P>As the A&s;tronomers, and Star-gazing <HI>Magi</HI> kept up the Dignity of their Characters, and out-did all the re&s;t of Mankind in tho&s;e Ages; &s;o the &s;econd &s;ort too apply'd them&s;elves to the Study of lower Life, ob&s;erving the Mechani&s;m of Nature, and introducing the helps of Art, even to perform things &s;urpri&s;ing.

Artificial or ratio|nal Magick, in which they included the Know|ledge of all judicial A&s;trology, the ca&s;ting or cal|culating Nativities, curing Di&s;ea&s;es by Charms, by particular Figures placed in this or that Po&s;ition; by Herbs gather'd at this or that particular Cri&s;is of Time, and by &s;aying &s;uch and &s;uch Words over the Patient, repeated &s;o many times, and by &s;uch and &s;uch Ge&s;tures, &s;troking the Fle&s;h in &s;uch and &s;uch a manner, and innumerable &s;uch like Pieces of Mimickry; working not upon the Di&s;ea&s;e it &s;elf, but upon the Imagination of the di&s;temper'd Peo|ple, and &s;o effecting the Cures by the Power of Nature, tho' that Nature were &s;et on work by the weake&s;t and &s;imple&s;t methods imaginable. But, 3<HI>dly,</HI> the la&s;t is truly called Diabolical and helli&s;h Magick, which was operated by and with the Concurrence of the Devil, carried on by a Cor|&s;pondence with evil Spirits, with their Help, Pre&s;ence, and per&s;onal A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and chiefly practi&s;ed by their Prie&s;ts. And thus you have the general Sy&s;tem of Magick, according to my Title: But I mu&s;t enter a little into the Parti|culars.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65">The fir&s;t Sort of this Magick I have alrea|dy de&s;cribed; and I am &s;till of this Opinion, that in all the fir&s;t Ages of the World, there was very little other Magick than this known among Men; That, all the Diabolical Practices of the third Sort, or the Art and Legerdemain of the &s;econd Sort of Magick, was perfectly unknown to the Ma|gicians of <HI>Aegypt</HI> or <HI>Arabia,</HI> or afterwards of <HI>Chal|dea,</HI> at lea&s;t for a great while.</P>
<P>As for the Magicians of <HI>Chaldea,</HI> I have named them already, and we find nothing Diabolical among them: as to tho&s;e of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as were ordinarily called &s;o, 'tis evident al&s;o they were gene|rally the &s;ame; for when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> dreamed his fir&s;t Dream of the &s;even fat, and the &s;even lean Kine, <HI>Gen.</HI> xli. the Words are expre&s;s, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>He &s;ent for all the Magicians and all the wi&s;e Men of Aegypt</HI>; and what followed? <HI>there was none that could interpret</HI> his Dream. Upon which, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;ent for; where by the way you may ob&s;erve the difference between <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and the wi&s;e Men or Magicians, let them be what they will. The wi&s;e Men came when they were &s;ent for, and they put the King to the trou|ble of telling them his Dream, and, as we may be|lieve, went away to con&s;ult and con&s;ider of an An|&s;wer. If they could have amu&s;ed the King with any &s;ham An&s;wer, &s;o as to have quieted his Thoughts, which were di&s;turbed with the Oddne&s;s of the Ap|pearance, they would certainly have done it; whence I conclude they were not either of the &s;econd &s;ort of Magicians, who by Trick and Charm, muttering of Words, drawing Figures, and &s;uch empty and &s;imple Formalities, did their Work; if they had, they would certainly have cheated the King with &s;ome of their Impo&s;tures and Legerdemain, and have made him accept of this or that wild Story for an Interpretation.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="66">Nor were they diabolical Magicians, &s;uch as by a real and immediate Conver&s;ation with the Devil, or &s;ome of his invi&s;ible Agents which we call evil Spirits, wrought their u&s;ual Wonders, or Delu&s;ions like Wonders; and &s;uch as perhaps tho&s;e after|wards made u&s;e of by another <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> really were; who mimick'd the Miracles of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the &s;ight of the King and his Court: If they had been &s;uch, the Devil would not have &s;uffer'd them to be &s;o di&s;graced before their Lord, as to go away and &s;ay they could make nothing of it, nor give him the Interpretation; the Devil would certainly have furni&s;hed them with &s;ome kind of Interpretation, true or fal&s;e, at lea&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould have &s;atisfied the King for the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> It is very rea&s;onable to &s;ugge&s;t here, that the&s;e Magicians and wi&s;e Men of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and &s;o tho&s;e afterwards at <HI>Babylon,</HI> had been u&s;ually called together before, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions as tho&s;e; that they had often interpreted Dreams, perhaps for the King him&s;elf, as well as for other People; that &s;ometimes they did perhaps make &s;uch Interpretations as came to pa&s;s, by which, they maintained much of their Reputation a|mong the People, as wi&s;e Men and as Magi|cians: the &s;ame we &s;ee practi&s;ed among us to this day by many an ignorant old Woman, without the lea&s;t Claim to the venerable Name of <HI>Magician,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>Wi&s;e</HI>; al&s;o we cannot doubt but that the Kings of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and of <HI>Ba|bylon</HI> did expect and believe tho&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> could interpret if they would; it had been el&s;e a prepo&s;terous piece of Cruelty in <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar</HI> to put all the <HI>Magicians</HI> and wi&s;e Men to death, becau&s;e they did not tell him his Dream and the Interpretation, if he did really believe they were not able to do it; for

<P>But when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> comes to talk with <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> hone&s;tly tells the King it was not in him; mode&s;t dive&s;ting him&s;elf of all Claim to the Honour whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he fore&s;aw was going to be put upon him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> giving up the Prai&s;e to the &s;upream Agent, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whom it was due. <HI>v.</HI> 16. <HI>It is not in me, but G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall give Pharaoh an An&s;wer of Peace</HI>; and then goes on to interpret the Dream.</P>

<P>But then let us &s;ee how the Text di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the kinds, and you will find 'tis exactly according to my pre&s;ent di&s;tinction: Before, 'tis &s;aid <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;ent for the Magicians and wi&s;e Men of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> See <HI>Gen.</HI> xli.8. But now the Style is changed, as the People were al&s;o, <HI>Exod.</HI> vii.11. <HI>Pha|raoh</HI> called the Sorcerers and Magicians of <HI>Aegypt</HI>; and &s;ee then how they acted, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. <HI>and the Magi|cians did the &s;ame with their Inchantments</HI>; and the like in &s;everal other Places: &s;o that here the Magicians and wi&s;e Men were of another &s;ort, for they acted by a Diabolical Practice, as Sorcerers and Dealers with the Devil; be&s;ides 'tis every where &s;aid, they did it by their Inchantments, which we never find &s;o much as mentioned before; no, nor afterwards a|mong the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and the Magicians of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>; but they acted by the meer Force of their Wi&s;dom and Learning, <HI>viz.</HI> the Study of Nature; and when that failed them, they acknowledged they had no other Power, and could go no farther.</P>
<P>Now, as I &s;aid before, having pa&s;s'd thro' the be&s;t of the Art, and the fir&s;t and only hone&s;t Part of the Practice, it follows, that we con|&s;ider the Sub&s;equent Progre&s;&s;ions of the People called Magicians, what they have been under&s;tood to be, what they now are in the World, and what we are to under&s;tand by the Word when we &s;ay <HI>Magick</HI> or <HI>a Magician</HI>; and this is,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Jugler or Shower of Tricks by Legerde|main and Slight of hand; which I call only a &s;ham Magick, and which the World has been indeed de|luded with for many Ages.</P>

<P><PB N="55" REF="70">But this is not the ca&s;e at all, for I am not now upon the Proof of the Reality and Exi&s;tence of the <HI>Devil</HI>; that has been worthily undertaken, and hi|&s;torically, mathematically, and enthu&s;ia&s;tically e|nough Perform'd by a late Writer in another Place: But I am now talking of a Set of People who were not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd BY, but rather, as it may be called, are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd OF the <HI>Devil</HI>; have him in their keeping and Cu&s;tody; where, by the way, I do not find but that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to be very much in Subjection to them; whether it be volun|tarily, and &s;o perhaps, like an ob&s;equious Dog, that fawns for what he can get; He (the Devil) creeps and cringes, in order the better to carry on his own De&s;igns, which indeed is not at all improbable; or whether there were Ways and Means which the&s;e antient People had found out, by what &s;uperiour Power I know not, to &s;ubject the Devil to their Orders, and make him their humble Servant upon all Occa&s;ions, to run and go, fetch and carry, at their whi&s;tle: All the&s;e critical Enquiries may per|haps come in my way, when I come to talk more particularly of the <HI>Magick</HI> of our pre&s;ent times, and the Management of our modern Cunning Men, who pretend to have the Devil in a String, make him jump over a Broom&s;tick, dance and &s;how Tricks, as the Mountebanks and Merry-Andrews do with a Bear and a Monkey.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if I can but, in my further Search after tho&s;e things, find out the Method the antient Magicians had to manage the <HI>Devil</HI> thus, and bring him to their hand, and can convey the Art to Po&s;terity, or at lea&s;t &s;et up a Scheme for the pre&s;ent Improvement of it, I &s;hall not doubt but I &s;hall meet with Encouragement; and if the eminent Mr. <HI>Wh&mdash;on</HI> will but &s;toop to join in with my De&s;ign (as I doubt not he will, if there be but Money to be got by it) we may publi&s;h our Read|ings,

<P>Be&s;ides, when we are thus engaged in Satan's Service, and in Conjunction with his Friends and Favourites, we cannot doubt but the <HI>Devil</HI> him|&s;elf will be &s;o much obliged, that he may come frankly and Voluntier, and let us into the Secret, bind him&s;elf Apprentice to us for a Term of Years, and enable us to play the Devil with him for the Time to come, as he had played the De|vil with us for &s;o many Years pa&s;t.

he lo&s;t a great deal of his Credit with his Em|ployers, and perhaps with the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Magicians of <HI>Aegypt</HI> to do tho&s;e things, or in &s;hort, that they made u&s;e of him as their In&s;trument, is plain from the Text, <HI>viz.</HI> that they did it by their Inchantments: What manner of Conjurings or Inchantments they were that they made u&s;e of, we have no particular light into from the &s;acred Text; but perhaps &s;ome Gue&s;s may be made at it, from what happen'd frequently in tho&s;e Countries in after-Ages.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we find that whatever the Magicians in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and in <HI>Media,</HI> and in tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries were, (for their Credit continued many Ages) yet in <HI>Aegypt</HI> they were (after that) chiefly Sorcerers and Dealers with the <HI>Devil</HI>; and in a word, <HI>Aegypt</HI> &s;eem'd to be the Nur&s;ery of human <HI>Devils</HI> for all the World. Hence <HI>Baalim</HI> is called a Witch, and hence in the <HI>Roman</HI> times the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Sorcerers were brought to <HI>Antioch</HI> for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Ju|lian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, to utter Predictions, and to flat|ter the Emperor with their good Omens and their Progno&s;tications; in which he was &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, that they put the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Delu&s;ions upon him, 'till the Citizens of <HI>Antioch</HI> made a je&s;t of him, and ex|po&s;ed his Inchantments to Ridicule; for which, had he lived to come back from the War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> he had vowed a &s;evere Revenge.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> are to this day, the common Strollers of the World, and are &s;ucceeded by a Race of Vagabonds who pretend to the Art, without the real Wickedne&s;s of it, and would be thought to deal with the Devil, when the Truth is, they know little or nothing of him.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell you that the Word <HI>Gyp&s;ie</HI> is derived from the&s;e &s;trolling <HI>Magicians,</HI> which really came out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and wandering over the World, got Money by their pretending

to Magick, telling Fortunes, predicting Events, and Mountebanking the World with their Inchant|ments; 'till at la&s;t having tired the Devil with following them, and the Drudgery of their Ser|vice being not worth his while, Satan left them; and they have been &s;ince that, for &s;ome time, in the Cla&s;s of the well-known Cardinal &mdash; who pretending to an Acquaintance with the Devil, and to have three inferior Daemons appointed to wait on him, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ent tho&s;e three Daemons to tell his Neighbours 'twas all a Cheat, and that he, <HI>Satan,</HI> had nothing to do with him.</P>
<P>'Tis very &s;trange Men &s;hould be &s;o fond of being thought wickeder than they are; that they cannot forbear, but that they mu&s;t abu&s;e the very Devil, and claim Kindred of him, whether he has any Knowledge of them or no: But thus it is, and we need not go to <HI>Aegypt</HI> for Examples, when we have &s;o many pieces of dull Witchcraft among our &s;elves.</P>
<P>It is true the <HI>Devil</HI> does not often decline an Acquaintance where he can find his Account in it; and therefore the eminent Doctor &mdash; may hope, that after a little farther Application to Here&s;y and Bla&s;phemy, he may be thought worthy of Admit|tance into Satan's Favour, at lea&s;t &s;o much as to &s;ettle a Corre&s;pondence, that &s;o they may act in concert for the future.</P>
<P>I am told &s;ome have thought it a particular Re|putation to them to have it &s;uppo&s;ed they maintain a Corre&s;pondence of this kind, which mu&s;t be up|on the foot of Satan's Credit, &s;uppo&s;ing that he knows who is fit for his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and who not, and that they mu&s;t be all capable Heads that he thinks fit to be concerned with in this manner; for as wi&s;e Princes always chu&s;e wi&s;e Councellors, the <HI>Devil</HI> under&s;tands the Capacities of his Friends &s;o well, that he is never mi&s;taken in his choice;
<PB N="59" REF="74">
but they that are concerned with him mu&s;t at lea&s;t be of the Cunning Cla&s;s, for he has no Incli|nation at all to Fools.</P>
<P>This brought &s;ome ju&s;t Reflections into my Thought upon the Conduct of our Times, and im|mediately cleared up the Characters of &s;ome of the greate&s;t Politicians of our Age, at lea&s;t in my Opi|nion, &s;eeing 'tis evident they either have too much Brains, or too little, for the infernal Corre&s;pondence; let the World judge which of the two is their Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;ay it cleared up the Character of &s;ome great Men to me, and I concluded they were no Ma|gicians, that they neither practi&s;ed Magick in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, as Philo&s;ophers; or in the la&s;t Sen&s;e, as Conjurers; what they might do in the middle Sen&s;e, as Jugglers, that remains to be enquired into as Op|portunity may pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Indeed I run over in my Reflections the pre&s;ent Situation of mo&s;t of the publick Affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Prime Mini&s;ters, grand Viziers, the State&s;men, the Coun&s;ellors, Generals, Admirals; the Clergy, whether Popi&s;h or Prote&s;tant, <HI>Greek</HI> Church, or <HI>Roman</HI> Church, Chri&s;tian or Mahometan; and I mu&s;t &s;peak it to their Honour, that except, as a late Writer taught me to except, our own People, our own Country and Country Worthies, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on to think any of the pre&s;ent Managers to be <HI>Ma|gicians</HI>; whether, as above, we con&s;ider the Magi|cians to be Philo&s;ophers, or as <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> Inchanters and Conjurers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion which brought the ancient hone&s;t <HI>Magi,</HI> who&s;e original Study was Philo&s;ophy, A&s;tronomy, and the Works of Nature, to turn Sorcerers and Wizzards, and deal with the Devil; and how their Conver&s;ation began.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING thus &s;tated the Fact, and given you what I call a <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of <HI>Magick,</HI> 'tis nece&s;&s;ary now, that in pur&s;uance of my Title, I &s;hould in|&s;i&s;t more particularly upon the third and la&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Magick</HI> I mention'd, and which is call'd <HI>Diabolical,</HI> or according to the vulgar Acceptation, the <HI>Black-art,</HI> and bring it out to you from its very foun|dation.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="77">This mu&s;t be deduced Hi&s;torically from the o|ther two, or el&s;e I cannot lead you regularly into its Original, or give you its true De&s;cription; be|&s;ides, a great many u&s;eful and agreeable Specula|tions offer them&s;elves in the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the thing it &s;elf, which will be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak to, as we go along.</P>
<P><HI>Magick</HI> did not jump at once into Being, as to the thing it &s;elf; it was not a Revelation from Hell, made at once to Mankind, to tell them what they might do: The Devil did not come and offer his Service <HI>Gratis</HI> to us, and repre&s;enting how u&s;eful a Slave he would be, &s;olicit us to take him into Pay, and this at once without Ceremony or Introduction.</P>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> it was a long Progre&s;&s;ion of Studies, and Improvement in wicked and mi&s;chievous Schemes, that brought Mankind to have recour&s;e to the In|fernals, to &s;eek the Aid of the dark Agents below, and to &s;ollicit a Commerce of that kind: Nor was this done till after finding many Diffi|culties in their other way, they &s;aw evidently they could not do without him, could not accompli&s;h their mi&s;chievous De&s;ires by other Methods, and that this way it was to be done.</P>
<P>Not but that the Devil was very ready, when he found him&s;elf made nece&s;&s;ary; I &s;ay, he was very ready to come into the Schemes when propos'd, and to &s;erve us in our Occa&s;ion, and that with a Wil|lingne&s;s which was extreamly obliging; which &s;hew'd him to be a Per&s;on of abundance of Complai&s;ance, and mighty willing to engage us whatever it co&s;t him; as much as to &s;ay, he was glad he could &s;erve us, was ready to do his utmo&s;t for us, and the like.</P>
<P>Now to go back briefly to the Occa&s;ion which brought the <HI>Magicians</HI> to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking to him for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to take him into the Ma|nagement of their Affairs; the Ca&s;e was in &s;hort
<PB N="63" REF="78">
this: The World, as I have &s;aid already, began to be wi&s;er than the Ages before them; the ordinary <HI>Magick</HI> of the former Ages would not pa&s;s any longer for Wi&s;dom; and if the wi&s;e Men, <HI>as they were called,</HI> did not daily produce &s;ome new Di&s;|coveries, 'twas evident the Price and Rate of <HI>South&s;aying</HI> would come down to nothing.</P>
<P>If this put them upon Stratagem and Art, in or|der to keep up their Credit, and maintain the Di|&s;tance between them and the inferior Rank of Men, it is not to be wonder'd at; and the&s;e Strata|gems were of &s;everal kinds, as the Occa&s;ion and the Wit of the Undertakers pre&s;ented; for you are to &s;uppo&s;e the inquiring Temper of the common Peo|ple to be arriv'd to &s;uch a Height, that nothing could pa&s;s with them for True, at lea&s;t nothing which had any Novelty in it, unle&s;s it was con|firm'd by &s;ome &s;trange thing, &s;ome Sign, &s;ome Miracle to be wrought, by which the Mind re|ceiving a due Impre&s;&s;ion, entertain'd the re&s;t of the propos'd Wonder with the more Satisfaction.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the <HI>Magicians</HI> &s;atisfy'd the Curio&s;ity of the People by Juggle and Trick, by framing ar|tificial Voices and Noi&s;es; foretelling &s;trange Events, by mechanical Appearances, and all the Cheats which we find put upon the ignorant Peo|ple to this Day; and it would be tedious to enu|merate the Particulars by which they impos'd upon one another. You may gue&s;s at them by &s;uch as are mention'd before; but principally tho&s;e who &s;tudied the heavenly Motions, had great Opportu|nities of recommending them&s;elves for Men of Craft, pretending to tell Fortunes, calculate Nati|vities, re&s;olve Doubts, read the Lines of Nature drawn in the Face, Palms of the Hand, Symetry of the Body, Moles and Marks on the Fle&s;h, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79">The&s;e things they carry'd to a due Length, and we find the Succe&s;s was &s;o much to their Ad|vantage, that the whole World, or great Part of it, has been Gyp&s;ey-ridden by them, even to this Day.</P>
<P>It would fill a Volume larger than I propo&s;e this &s;hall be, to give an Account of the &s;everal Stratagems tho&s;e People had Recour&s;e to, in the early Days of Sorcery and <HI>Magick,</HI> in order to main|tain their Character in the World as extraordinary. For I mu&s;t do them &s;o much Ju&s;tice as I go, to ob&s;erve, that they did not immediately run to the Devil for Help; or at lea&s;t, if &s;ome among them dealt in the Dark, and corre&s;ponded below, they did not all do &s;o; perhaps they were not harden'd enough at fir&s;t for the carrying on &s;uch a Traffick. 'Twas a new Commerce, and had &s;omething a little &s;hocking at fir&s;t, till the nece&s;&s;ity of their South|&s;aying Circum&s;tances brought them to comply with any thing rather than lo&s;e their Trade.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> you mu&s;t know, were a People originally attended with two things, which natu|rally made way for the&s;e Magical Studies.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mo&s;t impertinently Inqui&s;itive, gro&s;ly Igno|rant in the main, (as Ignorance would be called now, but mighty Wi&s;e, as things were rated at that time) and prying into every thing with an irre|&s;i&s;tible Pa&s;&s;ion for what they call'd Knowledge; on this Account they pa&s;s'd for the wi&s;e&s;t Nation on Earth, and <HI>Aegypt</HI> was e&s;teem'd the Center of Learning and Knowledge. Hence <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;aid to be learned in all the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI> It is true, and they are upbraided with it by the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> which they call the South; and who, tho' <HI>Arabians,</HI> are call'd <HI>Ethiopi|ans</HI> in Scripture; I &s;ay, it is true, that the <HI>Aegyp|tians</HI> learned all their Magick, that is, their A&s;tro|nomy and A&s;trology, from the <HI>Arabians</HI>; and they
<PB N="65" REF="80">
tell us that <HI>Abraham</HI> in&s;tructed his Son <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> in all the &s;uperior Knowledge in which his Po&s;terity afterwards grew &s;o famous.</P>
<P N="2">2. With this inqui&s;itive Temper of the <HI>Aegypti|ans,</HI> they were al&s;o mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly Super&s;titious; I &s;ay, mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly, becau&s;e it &s;hew'd it &s;elf in that &s;ordid and mo&s;t &s;imple Idolatry which they had mong them, in which they &s;unk below the com|mon Notions of Wor&s;hip practis'd by the mo&s;t ignorant Nations in the World; for they wor|&s;hip'd, or made a God of, almo&s;t every thing that came in their way; as the Ox, the Calf, the Wa|ter of <HI>Nile,</HI> nay the River it &s;elf, the Sand, the Crocodiles, and numberle&s;s things as &s;en&s;ele&s;s as tho&s;e.</P>
<P>As the&s;e things were peculiar to them as a Na|tion, &s;o they particularly qualify'd them to be im|pos'd upon by their South&s;ayers and Magicians, with all manner of Delu&s;ions; nor did the &s;ubtle Magicians fail to make their Advantage, upon all Occa&s;ions, of this &s;uper&s;titious and inquiring Hu|mour of the People, but u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Stratagem and Art to delude and impo&s;e upon them.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, they &s;oon mixt their Religion and their Magick together, their Philo&s;ophy and their Idolatry were made A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the general Fraud, and to rai&s;e a due Veneration in the Minds of the People: To this or that particular Tale advanc'd by their Prie&s;ts, they brought always along with them &s;ome extraordinary Revelation from the Gods, &s;ome wonderful Di&s;covery in Nature, or &s;omething &s;trange and miraculous.</P>
<P>How &s;trangely does religious Enthu&s;ia&s;m keep its hold of Mankind, and how exactly do pa&s;t things and pre&s;ent corre&s;pond! As the End is the &s;ame, &s;o are the Means: pious Frauds got ground from the Beginning, and pious Frauds get ground to the End. As no Cheats are &s;o fatal as tho&s;e which
<PB N="66" REF="81">
come prefac'd with Introductions of Religion, &s;o no Cheats are &s;o ea&s;y to prevail, &s;o &s;oon make Im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the People, or &s;tamp tho&s;e Impre&s;|&s;ions deeper.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts among the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> when they turn'd <HI>Magicians,</HI> (or rather, I &s;hould have &s;aid, the <HI>Magicians,</HI> when they turn'd Prie&s;ts,) &s;et up for Re|velation, In&s;piration, and a Conver&s;ation with their Gods; and for this purpo&s;e they withdrew into the De&s;arts and Wa&s;tes, of which the Country is known to be full; and where to their Glory (Shame) be it &s;poken, the Religious of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church play'd the &s;ame Game over again, &s;ome Ages afterward.</P>
<P>Hither the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts, I &s;ay, retir'd for Conver&s;ation with their Gods, from whence they were &s;ure to come back in&s;pir'd, that is to &s;ay, fill'd with &s;ome new Delu&s;ion to impo&s;e upon the People. Here they cut &s;acred Marks upon the Trees, and then brought them back as the Lan|guage taught them from the Gods; and by which they pretended, after muttering over them &s;ome un&s;ignifying Significations, to utter &s;ome An&s;wers to any Difficulties propo&s;ed to them; and then &s;ending their Votaries into the Wilderne&s;s, they would &s;et them to &s;earch for the &s;ame Divine Cha|racters; which after long looking for, they would find upon &s;ome Stone, or Po&s;t, or Tree, and come home in Raptures for the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Others of the&s;e Divine <HI>Magicians,</HI> or Diviners rather, would clamber up to the top of the Pyra|mids, who&s;e immen&s;e Height we have &s;uch certain Accounts of, as may make the climbing up &s;eem incredible, whatever el&s;e may not be &s;o. Yet here they went to make Ob&s;ervations, and Calculations of the heavenly Motions, &s;ome &s;ay; but according to others, to make their Conjurations, their &s;acred Retreats, and to carry on the Delu&s;ion of conver&s;ing with the Gods.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="82">Here al&s;o they cut their Diabolical Marks, which the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> call the Sacred Characters, which they left behind them indeed in the Stone upon the upper flat of the Pyramid; for according to the learned <HI>Greaves,</HI> the Summit of the Pyramid was not a Point as the top of a Spire, or as repre&s;ent|ing a Flame, and which by its great Height it &s;eem'd to be; but the uppermo&s;t Part form'd a Plain, which <HI>Stephanus</HI> in his Comment, &s;upplying the Defect in <HI>Herodotus,</HI> makes to be eight <HI>Orgyiae,</HI> which again, according to <HI>Suidas,</HI> is a <HI>Fathom,</HI> or &s;ix Foot; &s;o that the Plain on the top of the Pyra|mid mu&s;t be eight Fathom &s;quare: Others report it to be nine Foot only, tho' I think the former more probable.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, here 'tis certain they made, or found made by others, certain dark, My&s;tick, and as they pretended &s;acred Characters, who&s;e Sig|nifications were repre&s;ented by the Prie&s;ts ju&s;t as they pleas'd; for we have rea&s;on to believe they had not then the u&s;e of Letters; and as &s;ome think, the&s;e my&s;tick Characters were the Original of all the Hyeroglyphick Writing, which was afterwards the ordinary Practice of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> till the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters were handed to them by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> from the Writing of God deliver'd him at Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI></P>
<P>It is very well ob&s;erv'd by the learned Author ju&s;t now nam'd, that had not the Prie&s;ts &s;tood in need of &s;omething extraordinary, to make their coele&s;tial Conver&s;e &s;eem more Weighty and Impor|tant, all their A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations might as well have been made from the plain of the Rock upon which tho&s;e Pyramids are built, and which &s;upport the Foundation; which, as he takes notice, is it &s;elf &s;o elevated, that in a Country which is all a low, flat and level Surface, for near fifty Miles every way, and affords a fair Hori&s;on, is as well &s;uited for all
<PB N="68" REF="83">
&s;uch Ob&s;ervations as require a large extended Pro|&s;pect, as it would be if it were &s;even or eight hun|dred Foot higher, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Height of the Pyramid.</P>
<P>But the Rea&s;on is evident; the mounting the Steps or Degrees of the Pyramid on the out-&s;ide, was a work of va&s;t Labour, and &s;ome Hazard; Every Head could not bear the Elevation; every Mind could not have Re&s;olution to undertake it; few would venture up to examine the Truth of the Characters, or bring down Copies of them, much le&s;s examine into the Nature of them. And if they had gone up it was enough, the cunning Prie&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had impre&s;t them there, and left the Originals up|on the top Stone of the wonderful Building, magi|cal and awful in it &s;elf; and as it was really &s;o, that there the Characters were to be &s;een, it was no hard matter to per&s;uade the credulous &s;uper&s;ti|tious People,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That they were written there by the Finger of the Gods:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Interpretation of them was given by In&s;piration to the &s;ame Prie&s;ts, or wi&s;e Men, who fir&s;t di&s;cover'd, and brought down the Characters them&s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>How far the&s;e Delu&s;ions have prevail'd, and do to this Day prevail among the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> I need not tell you; 'tis enough to &s;ay it has gone &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Length, as has encouraged Enthu&s;ia&s;tic Pretenders, and made <HI>Aegypt</HI> the Nur&s;ery of Witchcraft to the whole World.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould we think it &s;trange to have Di|vinity and Magick thus blended together in a Coun|try &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as <HI>Aegypt?</HI> Has there not been a &s;tranger Mixture of Magick and Witchcraft, not omitting Prie&s;tcraft, in all kinds of Religions ever &s;ince, and is it le&s;s among the Politer Religions now in Vogue, than it was in tho&s;e Days?</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="84">To begin at the very Pinnacle of the Church, and to leave Judaical Magick all behind us, tho' they had the Devil almo&s;t in every Synagogue; I &s;ay, to begin at the Pinnacle of the Church, How many Popes in particular does Hi&s;tory give us an Account of, who have been Sorcerers and Conjurers, and who have dealt with the Devil in the mo&s;t open and avow'd manner? How has the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church been e&s;tabli&s;ht upon the Artificial Magick of the Clergy? and how ju&s;tly may we &s;ay to her, as <HI>Jehu</HI> to the King of <HI>I&s;rael, What Peace, while the Whoredoms of thy Mother Jezebel and her Witchcrafts are &s;o many?</HI></P>
<P>But not to make our Enquiries a Satyr upon our &s;elves, in falling upon Popery, where we are equally guilty; let us recommend it to our Mo&s;t Reve|rend, and Right Reverend, to put our own Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick Affairs into &s;uch a good Po&s;ture, that we may have no <HI>Magick</HI> among us; that while we pull down the formal <HI>Magicians,</HI> we may not &s;et up the <HI>cunning Men</HI> upon the Fall of the <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> and erect Here&s;y in the room of Schi&s;m.</P>
<P>Some People pretend our Modern Divinity is &s;o Magical in its own Nature, that it is not ea&s;y to &s;eparate them; that is, in a word, the Devil has &s;o far encroach'd upon the Church, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to ca&s;t him out: the Truth is, if it was not &s;o, we &s;hould hardly have &s;uch a &s;truggle as has now been among us to keep the true Lord in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And &s;ince the Church has but one true and rightful King and Sovereign, there would never have been &s;uch a bold Attempt to depo&s;e him, if the Devil, the ancient U&s;urper of his Throne, had not been at work again to &s;tep up in his Room. But we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of this Part more plainly by and by.</P>
<P>It was with great Succe&s;s, that the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts went on in the manner as above, and their Artificial Magick went a great way in all the
<PB N="70" REF="85">
Ea&s;tern World; they were counted the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men, who, Mountebank like, could &s;how mo&s;t Tricks, and invent the mo&s;t &s;urprizing things to take with the Vulgar, &s;o as to give their Words the Force of an Oracle, and entitle them to the Character of Divine and Prophetick: And thus we may &s;uppo&s;e the World going on for many Ages, till at length, to come nearer our own Times, and indeed nearer to the Practice of our own Times too, their Mimickry was exhau&s;ted; they had no more Tricks to play, the juggling Trade grew &s;tale and dull, the World began to look beyond them, and expected &s;omething more; and &s;o the la&s;t, I do not &s;ay the Church Jugglers, went to the Devil for Help. I had rather tell you that another Generation, who had always been true <HI>Magicians,</HI> true Practicers of the Diabolical Part, came in play of cour&s;e, and &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t, who gradually depo&s;ed them&s;elves by their meer Impotency; and ju&s;t as Darkne&s;s is a deprivation of Light, and &s;uc|ceeds it by the meer Con&s;equence of things, &s;o the hone&s;t Ignorance of the innocent <HI>Magician</HI> being unable to keep the Expectation of the People up, and an&s;wer the Importunities of the Age, dealing with the Devil &s;ucceeded, even by the meer Con|&s;equence of things.</P>
<P>The new Magick coming thus in Play, let us &s;ee how it made its fir&s;t Entrance in the World, and in what Shapes it began to appear; in which Search we &s;hall find, in &s;hort, that Religion &s;till open'd the Door. For as the Devil a&s;pir'd at nothing more from the Beginning than to be &s;et up for a God, &s;o he always built his Chappel clo&s;e by God's Church; it was in the Con&s;equence of this, that the Prie&s;ts were always his more immediate Corre&s;pon|dents. How long they continued &s;o, but e&s;pecially when the Corre&s;pondence ceas'd, would be a Di&s;|covery worth making to the World: but O how difficult!</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="86">It is indeed to be ob&s;erv'd, and the Devil has done us Chri&s;tians that Ju&s;tice, that Satan has di&s;|cover'd his Attachment to the Pagan Rites in Di|&s;tinction from, and Oppo&s;ition to, the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip on many Occa&s;ions, and that particularly as perhaps the latter is more fitted to introduce Devil-wor&s;hip in the World; we have &s;ome In&s;tan|ces of his making this Di&s;tinction, particularly when the Emperor <HI>Julian,</HI> while he was only <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and had not declar'd him&s;elf Apo&s;tate, (nay, was perhaps more inclin'd to be a Chri&s;tian than a Pagan, for he was Educated a Chri&s;tian,) I &s;ay, it was ob&s;erv'd, that he was perverted from Chri|&s;tianity, and confirm'd a Pagan, by <HI>Maximus</HI> a <HI>Ma|gician.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> This <HI>Maximus</HI> was a <HI>Magician,</HI> when the Word <HI>Magician</HI> &s;ignified no more a wi&s;e Man, or a South&s;ayer, but a down-right Conjurer, a Ma&s;ter of the Black-art, or One who dealt with the Devil.</P>
<P>Nor was it that the <HI>Magicians</HI> were Favourers of Pagani&s;m only, but &s;uch was the Subtilty of the Devil, that indeed the Pagan Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted much in Sorcery and Magick, Conjurings, Invo|cation of Devils, and rai&s;ing evil Spirits; by The&s;e the Rites and Ceremonies of Pagani&s;m were &s;uppor|ted.

<P>The Devil had a great many good Rea&s;ons to befriend the Pagan Wor&s;hip, rather than the Chri|&s;tian; for that indeed the Sub&s;tance of Pagani&s;m was a Diabolical Sy&s;tem in it &s;elf, and to wor&s;hip the Heathen Gods, was E&s;&s;entially to wor&s;hip the Devil, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its Place.</P>

A bolder Infidel I have not met with &s;ince I was la&s;t at the Pagan Circle, near old <HI>Charing,</HI> where God was own'd, &s;worn by, imprecated, bla&s;phem'd, and deny'd, all in a Breath.</P>
<P>But to go on: The Curio&s;ity of Mankind I &s;ay was never fully &s;atisfy'd, but when &s;omething won|derful was offer'd, and therefore Miracle was im|mediately call'd for, when any new Sy&s;tem was offer'd, or any thing difficult propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus when God &s;ent <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> to <HI>Pha|raoh,</HI> he &s;uppo&s;es the very Ca&s;e; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> were to a&s;&s;ure <HI>Pharaoh</HI> that God &s;ent them, and they were in his Name to demand Liberty for the

<P>But hold! <HI>&s;ays Mo&s;es,</HI> we do not come to affront your <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> nor are the People we come to &s;peak for inclin'd to revolt or rebel; but we come from God; the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> whom we repre&s;ent are God's cho&s;en favourite Nation, tho' they are your Servants, and they are commanded to go three days Journey into the Wilderne&s;s, to perform a great Sacrifice, and make a great Fea&s;t to him; and therefore we come to de&s;ire your Leave, that we may go peaceably and do the Duty of our Wor|&s;hip; a&s;&s;uring your Maje&s;ty, that God him&s;elf, who has thus commanded us out, has &s;ent me to you to demand your A&s;&s;ent.</P>

<P>But &s;till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> with other the Heads of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> (for there were many more with them) in&s;i&s;ted, that they were &s;ent by the immediate Direction of God him&s;elf. And how do you prove

<P><HI>Aaron</HI> does &s;o, throws down his white Staff, and immediately it was turn'd into a Serpent.</P>

<P>Well, the&s;e Men being call'd in, <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> in Contempt of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and the Sign or Miracle they had &s;hewn, ask'd them if they could not do that as well as <HI>Aaron?</HI></P>
<P>They readily an&s;wer Yes, and fall to <HI>Paw-waw|ing,</HI> as the <HI>Americans</HI> call it, and u&s;ing their Inchant|mens, invoking or whi&s;pering their Daemons, or what other Diabolical Arts they might u&s;e we know not; but upon this, and their Staves or Rods being ca&s;t down, they were turn'd into Serpents too.</P>
<P>This was enough to make <HI>Pharaoh</HI> triumph over <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and their Company, and deriding their Mirale, tell them in&s;ultingly, this did not at all te&s;tifie their Mi&s;&s;ion from God, for they might &s;ee his wi&s;e Men could turn Rods into Serpents as well as they. Nor did the Di&s;tinction which God was pleas'd to &s;how, by &s;uffering <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Serpent to de|vour or &s;wallow up the Serpents of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Sorcerers, alter the Ca&s;e with <HI>Pharaoh</HI>; for that, as an Accident, did not import any thing at all in the Ca&s;e. And thus he &s;ent them, or rather drove them, away with Contempt, and immediately &s;ent Taskma&s;ters among the People to double their Afflictions, encrea&s;e their Labours, and force them to make Brick without Straw.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> come again with the &s;ame Me&s;&s;age, and it had the &s;ame Event, they are Banter'd and ridicul'd: As if the King had call'd to them thus; Well, you are come again, and you &s;ay God has &s;ent you, pray has he furni&s;h'd you with any better Te&s;timony than you had before, have you any other Miracle to &s;how?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="91">The &s;acred Amba&s;&s;adors gravely tell him they had, and if he would &s;till refu&s;e to grant their De|mands, he &s;hould &s;ee it; nay, they tell him be|fore-hand what it &s;hould be, namely, that they would turn the Waters of <HI>Nile,</HI> the great River of their Country, into Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Pharaoh,</HI> as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, not believing they could do it, treats them &s;till in the &s;ame manner, and refu&s;es &s;till to receive them as Me&s;&s;engers from God; upon which, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> calls to <HI>Aaron,</HI> and bids him &s;tretch out his Rod and &s;mite the Waters of the River, and they were immediately turned into Blood, and all the Waters, Ponds, and Pools be|&s;ides; for <HI>Aegypt</HI> is full of Pits and Ponds, wherein they pre&s;erve the Water of <HI>Nile</HI> after the annual In|undation.</P>
<P>The King, frighted at this &s;udden Change of the Water, is a little calmer than he was before; but con&s;idering the matter, he calls his <HI>Magicians</HI> to &s;ee if they could not do this al&s;o, as well as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; when they came they did the &s;ame, by which &s;till the blinded Mind of the Prince continued ob&s;ti|nate.</P>
<P>I might run through the re&s;t of the Miracles wrought there, and &s;hew you how the <HI>Magicians</HI> brought Frogs, but could not bring Lice; but this is not to the Ca&s;e; the Story is known.</P>
<P>Only one thing I mu&s;t note for your Direction in the reading this Part of the Story, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Magicians could bring Plagues, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, as well as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI>; but the Magi|cians could not remove them again, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did; &s;o that the King might have perceived that which the Magicians them&s;elves acknowledged in the Plague of the Lice, that it was the Finger of God which only could remove the Plagues he brought.</P>
<P>The whole De&s;ign of this Remark is to &s;hew, that it was always the Temper of Mankind to de|mand
<PB N="77" REF="92">
a Sign or a Miracle, to confirm any new ad|vanced Doctrine, or any extraordinary Mi&s;&s;ion, and to take tho&s;e Miracles when produced for a full Confirmation.</P>
<P>This Temper of the People, as it drove the Ma|gicians to their Shifts how to &s;upply Miracles to obtain Credit with the People, &s;o it drove them beyond their Shifts too at la&s;t, and brought them to a Confederacy with the Devil for a Supply of Wonderfuls to delude the People. They tell us of a certain <HI>Sorcerer</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> who for the Confir|mation of &s;ome particular thing, which he had af|firmed to the People, to keep up his Credit with them, told them, that &s;uch an Evening he would cau&s;e Fire to come down from Heaven, and that it &s;hould re&s;t on the Top of &s;uch a certain Hill, in the Sight of all the City.</P>
<P>Whether the cunning Arti&s;t had found out any Compo&s;ition by which to make artificial Fireworks, agreeable to what is done at this time or not, is not certain; tho' 'tis mo&s;t certain the Art of ma|king Gunpowder was not then known, nor for above a thou&s;and Years afterwards: But for certain he cau&s;ed &s;uch a Machine to mount in the Air, un&s;een in the dark of the Evening, which then bur&s;ting, came down again in a Shower of Fire, like the Stars (as we call them) which &s;pread them&s;elves and fall down upon the bur&s;ting of the Tail of a Rocket; and this &s;o amazed the People, that they believed afterwards every thing he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Simon</HI> the Sorcerer is &s;aid, by his Diabolical Inchantments, to fly up in the Air, and perform &s;o many &s;urprizing things, that 'tis &s;aid the Peo|ple called him <HI>the Great Power of God,</HI> or the Appearance of the great Power of God, <HI>Acts</HI> viii.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</P>
<P>Indeed the De&s;cription the Scripture gives there of this <HI>Simon</HI> is very remarkable to the ca&s;e in hand; fir&s;t 'tis &s;aid, <HI>ver.</HI> 9. <HI>That he u&s;ed Sorcery and bewitched</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="93">
<HI>the People,</HI> that is, the People of <HI>Samaria</HI>; then 'tis added, all the People gave heed to him, and &s;aid, <HI>This Man is the great Power of God</HI>; the meaning i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evident, this Man has done &s;uch great and &s;trange things, &s;hewed &s;uch Miracles, &s;uch Wonders, that none but the great Power of God could enable him to do; and therefore 'tis certain that he is aided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the great Power of God; and this he held a long time. <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>To him they had re|gard, becau&s;e for a long time he had bewitched them with his Sorceries.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Simon</HI> and the People at <HI>Samaria</HI> was ju&s;t as it was with <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Magicians, when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> came to him. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his Courtiers gave heed to <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> for that of a long time they had bewitched them with their <HI>Sorceries.</HI></P>
<P>It remains a Que&s;tion here, by what Power and by who&s;e Hand it mu&s;t be, that the Magicians of <HI>Aegypt</HI> turned their Rods into Serpents; &s;mote the Waters, and turned them into Blood; brought up Frogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that is, in &s;hort, mimicked or imi|tated the Miracles of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron.</HI> If I am asked by who&s;e Permi&s;&s;ion it was done, I know how to an&s;wer; but if you ask who was the In&s;tru|ment, I mu&s;t &s;ay it was the <HI>Devil</HI>; for the Text &s;ays expre&s;ly, they did it by their Inchantments.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when they were baffled in their <HI>Paw-wawing</HI> for Lice, and could not per|form it, 'tis &s;aid expre&s;ly, they acknowledged that they could not do it, for that was <HI>the Finger of God,</HI> Exod. viii.19.</P>
<P>Now whether the Magicians meant, it is the Fin|ger of God that hinders us from doing now as we did before, &s;o that we cannot bring up Lice as we did Frogs; or whether they &s;eemed to acknow|ledge, that the Plague of Lice was the Finger of God, tho' they did not grant that the Blood and
<PB N="79" REF="94">
the Frogs were &s;o, becau&s;e the Devil could do it al&s;o; this, I &s;ay, is a Doubt which Commentators do not re&s;olve, or at lea&s;t do not agree about.</P>
<P>But take it which way you will, 'tis an Acknow|ledgment, that what they did by their Sorcery and Inchantments, was not done by the Finger of God; and al&s;o that when the Finger of God was in the Work, their Sorcery and Inchantments were impotent and could do nothing.</P>
<P>It is not to be que&s;tioned but as this Corre&s;pon|dence began between the&s;e Magicians and the in|fernal Spirits, they did al&s;o upon all Occa&s;ions, and with the utmo&s;t of their Power, as well as with the greate&s;t Artifice and Cunning, endeavour to make the People believe, that what they did was by the great Power of God, by the Finger of Heaven; for this alone an&s;wer'd the End, which was Deluding, and Impo&s;ing upon Mankind. 'Twas the Unhappine&s;s of that Age, as it is of ours, when a more modern and indeed more fatal kind of Ma|gick is practi&s;ed in the World; I &s;ay, it was their Unhappine&s;s that the Minds of the People &s;eemed prepared for their Delu&s;ions, by being more ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> World had for many Ages been led and guided by the Juggles and Legerdemain of their South&s;ayers and wi&s;e Men, as they were called; and when they by the Degeneracy of the Times were, as I have &s;aid, brought &s;o low as to &s;ubmit to Sor|cery and Inchantment, they had a va&s;t Advantage over the People, by the good Opinion which the People had of their Sincerity and Hone&s;ty, and that they would not by any means cheat and impo&s;e upon them.</P>
<P>Thus when Errors and damnable Doctrines in Religion are broached and &s;et on foot among us by Men of apparent Sanctity in Conver&s;ation, Men of &s;evere Morals, of rigid and au&s;tere Lives, blamele&s;s
<PB N="80" REF="95">
and mortified Manners, &s;trictly practi&s;ing the good things which they preach, and who by that Strict|ne&s;s of Conver&s;ation have obtained a Reputation in the World, as Men that do not willingly deceive the People, or that at lea&s;t have not a wicked De|&s;ign to deceive; In &s;uch ca&s;e, I &s;ay, Error comes armed with a fatal and double Power, and its in|fluence is much more likely to do Mi&s;chief, the Hypocri&s;y is the more dangerous, and the People more ea&s;ily abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Who could, <HI>in our Days</HI> expect, that Men of Morals, Men of un&s;potted Lives, and who&s;e Characters would be &s;uch as never to &s;uffer any Reproach, &s;hould blemi&s;h all their Reputation, which that commendable Rectitude of Life had obtained for them, with harbouring a horrid and dete&s;table Bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t it &s;elf, robbing the Son of God of the Equality which he thought it no Robbery to a&s;&s;ume, and de|nying the Godhead of him who is <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed for ever</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>But this is &s;till too &s;olemn, and I am not al&s;o come on far enough in Order of time to talk of tho&s;e People; we &s;hall meet with them again in our Way: for the pre&s;ent I mu&s;t be content to go back to the South and to the Ea&s;t, vi&s;it the pri|mitive Times of Sorcery and Witchcraft, and &s;ee if we can find it out, how the <HI>Devil</HI> and Mankind came to be &s;o well acquainted as we find they have been; for certainly it was not all done at once. Satan, who&s;e Region is the Air, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is in the Dark, was not immediately corre&s;ponded with in an open, publick, and avowed manner; he did not walk about in Per&s;on, undi&s;guis'd and open<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cloathed in the Shapes and Figures of a <HI>Devil,</HI> and acting like him&s;elf; he certainly made his court to Mankind by &s;ome particular Applications, or they to him; for the Learned are not fully agreed who made the fir&s;t Advances towards the new Acquain|tance,

and whether the Devil made love fir&s;t, or how Mankind found him out. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is an Enquiry of Moment, and the Hi&s;tory of it would take up &s;ome Room in our Speculations, perhaps very much to your Satisfaction; I mean, if we could give a true and particular Account how the <HI>Devil</HI> and Mankind came fir&s;t acquainted.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it would be particularly improving to our Under&s;tandings, if we could tell where the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of the Corre&s;pondence lay; that is to &s;ay, 1. Whether the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Admini&s;tration of his Affairs found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle a Cor|re&s;pondence among Mankind, and therefore, as Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> has it, travelled to this Globe upon the foot of new Di&s;coveries, and improved upon tho&s;e Di&s;coveries afterwards by the dexterity of his Ma|nagement, making his Acquaintance with Mankind his own way, and as he found proper for his Occa|&s;ions: or,</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether Mankind finding their De&s;ires to be wicked, infinitely greater than their Capacities, and being under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome ex|otick Helps, &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tances farther and other than they found natural Powers would &s;upply, made their Application to him; according to the laudable Example of my old Friend and good Pa|tron in every wicked Contrivance, the late Ho|nourable Mr. <HI>M&mdash;g M&mdash;</HI> who (&s;aving that I can|not &s;ay I believed him) told me, that being in an extraordinary Streight, and wanting an infallible Agent in a particular Piece of Revenge where a certain Female had jilted and in&s;ulted him, went out into his Garden, three Nights together, ju&s;t at the moment of Twelve, (<HI>that it &s;eems was the cri|tical</HI> time for Satan to be &s;poke with) and called him aloud by his Name, telling him he wanted his immediate Attendance in an Affair of the utmo&s;t Importance.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="97">Now, I &s;ay, which of the&s;e two was the Ca&s;e at the Beginning of the Intercour&s;e between Man and his Ma&s;ter, is hard to determine, and would be a mo&s;t admirable Di&s;covery if the Certainty could be come at, in a manner agreeable to the nature of the thing, &s;o as it might be depended upon.

<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge that I did not enquire of my Friend ju&s;t now named, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> gave his Attendance immediately, and with his u&s;ual Alacrity, upon his calling out &s;o Audibly to him; not that I ever doubted but that the <HI>Devil</HI> did wait upon him, becau&s;e 'tis vi&s;ible that he has acted as if the <HI>Devil</HI> had been in him ever &s;ince; but, I &s;ay, I &s;hould have enquired whether he came at the fir&s;t Call, for without doubt he called loud enough for him to hear; for, as Voice always a&s;cends, the Vibration moving mo&s;t naturally upward, and that Satan's particular Re&s;idence is &s;aid to lie that way, there is no room to que&s;tion but he could hear him; unle&s;s, as <HI>Elijah</HI> &s;aid to the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> he might be bu&s;y, or a&s;leep, or gone a Journey; which &s;eldom happens to him, &s;o as to be out of the way of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="99"><HI>N.B.</HI> Here indeed I ought to make &s;ome &s;mall Apology for what I happen'd to &s;ay of the Honourable Per&s;on I ju&s;t now mentioned, and who I &s;eemed to &s;ugge&s;t was not to be believed; which Expre&s;&s;ion (he being a Per|&s;on of Honour) <HI>I ought to explain,</HI> as I do by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, and in Manner and Form fol|lowing, <HI>that is to &s;ay</HI>; that he is always to be believed, in all Ca&s;es, and relating to all Per&s;ons, but him&s;elf; but he claiming a Right and Privilege of &s;landering him&s;elf, and being ex|ceeding fond of being thought wickeder than he is, I ventur'd, by way of Ob&s;ervation, to &s;u&s;pect his Veracity, when he talks of his Father's only Son; knowing that as he has &s;o con&s;tantly boa&s;ted of Sins he was never able to commit, and that every thing mu&s;t be fal&s;e which cannot be true, &s;o there is no Credit to be given to him in that Particular.</P>
<P>But in all other Ca&s;es you mu&s;t under&s;tand me to acknowledge him for a Man of as nice a Ta&s;te, and as &s;trict an Ob&s;erver of Truth and Decency, as ever Satan corre&s;ponded with; which publick Acknowledgment I hope he wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> take for ample Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Now, with Pardon for the needful Digre&s;&s;ion above, I go on with repeating in Sub&s;tance what I concluded before, <HI>viz.</HI> that this Difficulty is &s;o great, that I cannot ea&s;ily get over it, <HI>viz.</HI> to re&s;olve who began the Acquaintance between Satan and our Ance&s;tors of the Ea&s;t, for there it &s;eems they fir&s;t corre&s;ponded.</P>
<P>Nor can I proceed Hi&s;torically in my pre&s;ent Un|dertaking, without coming to a Certainty in this Point, and 'till it is determined one way or other; and for that Rea&s;on, I think I mu&s;t for the pre|&s;ent, 'till the <HI>Devil</HI> thinks fit to clear him&s;elf of the Charge, leave it at his Door, and grant that he
<PB N="85" REF="100">
found the Corre&s;pondence &s;o much to his Advan|tage, that is to &s;ay, &s;o much for the Intere&s;t of his pre&s;ent Undertakings of another kind, that he made no Scruple of being fir&s;t in the Application; that he &s;tooped without Ceremony to make the fir&s;t Vi&s;it, and &s;o began the Treaty afterwards in his own Name.</P>
<P>Nor has the <HI>Devil</HI> been very nice in his &s;ub&s;e|quent Intimacies, or in the Management of the Corre&s;pondence after it was begun; but has on &s;o many Occa&s;ions te&s;tified his Re&s;olution to culti|vate the Friend&s;hip &s;o (happily for him) begun, that they found him ever after at their Elbow when they had Occa&s;ion for him, and &s;ometimes whether they had Occa&s;ion for him or no; whe|ther he is le&s;s kind to their Po&s;terity, let his Friends and Confederates of the pre&s;ent Age te&s;tify.</P>
<P>It is true that &s;ometimes we find, or at lea&s;t they tell us &s;o, that he is too cunning for his Corre|&s;pondents; and that when he has drawn them into Bargains, he is not &s;o ju&s;t to his Word as he &s;hould be, or as they expected; and this brings &s;ome Scan|dal upon the Acquaintance, as if he was not a faith|ful Confederate, and that he leaves his Friends of|ten in the Lurch, as he did the late famous <HI>Car|touch</HI> in <HI>France, Jonathan Wild</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and as he has done the poor Trooper lately at <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> who, they &s;ay, he ought to have &s;ecured from the Officers of Ju&s;tice; and that when he had killed Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Halm</HI> the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ter, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould have given him an invi&s;ible Cloak to have carried him off, and not have left him to the Mercy of the Prote&s;tants, after he had done him &s;uch an eminent Piece of Service.</P>
<P>But let us bring things to a right Under&s;tanding, do Satan Ju&s;tice, and &s;et the Saddle upon the right <HI>Devil.</HI> In the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Que&s;tion is not, whether the <HI>Devil,</HI> after having made Bargains with the&s;e People, did not perform, and was not &s;o ju&s;t to his
<PB N="86" REF="101">
Word as they expected; but whether he was not as ju&s;t to his Word as they ought to have expected? For Example, perhaps in making their Bargains with the <HI>Devil,</HI> they expect things to be performed which it is not in his Power to perform; the Mi|&s;take lies not in <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf, but in them who make a God of him, and will have him be able to do every thing.</P>
<P>Now 'tis true that Satan, as he is a Spirit, is Magnipotent, but he never was Omnipotent; and therefore there may be, and are, abundance of fine things which &s;uch People expect of him, which he really not only never promi&s;es, but is not in any Condition to perform; and if People will have him do what he is not able to do, that is their Fault, not his; all they can blame him for in that ca&s;e is, that he does not tell them how far he can, or can|not, &s;erve them; and that truly, to give him his Due, &s;eems to be none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; but like a cunning Artificer, who is loth to tell you what he cannot do, but enlarges and expatiates upon his real Abili|ties; &s;o the <HI>Devil,</HI> if you are willing to believe he can do thus and thus for you, 'tis enough if he does but equivocate, and tacitly grant it, without engaging to perform; but he is not bound to con|fe&s;s his Impotence, and own he cannot do it: So the&s;e People pretend to blame him, whereas in truth they ought only to blame them&s;elves for expecting things of him, that even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf is not able to perform.</P>
<P>Thus our late Friend <HI>Jonathan,</HI> while he kept within Bounds, had, no doubt, a faithful and friend|ly Corre&s;pondence with him.
<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'But, &s;aid the <HI>Devil,</HI> What would <HI>Jonathan</HI> have me do? did he ex|pect I could &s;ave him, when he committed a Felo|ny even with his Fetters on, and while he was in <HI>Newgate?</HI> I had been his Protector in a thou|&s;and Rogueries, Things, which if I had not &s;tood by him, he could never have got over: I had

<P>The like Plea the <HI>Devil</HI> made for him&s;elf, no doubt, in the ca&s;e of his <HI>French</HI> Favourite <HI>Car|touch</HI>;
<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Had he thought fit, after a thou&s;and au|dacious Villanies &s;ucce&s;sfully committed, and an infinite Stock of Trea&s;ure ama&s;s'd, for he was grown rich by the Trade; had he thought fit to have left <HI>Paris,</HI> and march'd off, either out of the Kingdom, or at lea&s;t out of the City where he was &s;o well known, and &s;o diligently pur&s;ued, I had carried him &s;afe off.'</Q>
But he was ob&s;tinately and incon&s;iderately bold; and the <HI>Devil</HI> is not bound to &s;ave tho&s;e that re&s;olve they will be hang'd. Nay, if am not mi&s;informed, the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf told him, he would be taken if he &s;taid in <HI>Paris</HI>; and added, that the Search after him was &s;o hot, and &s;uch Rewards promi&s;ed, and he &s;o well known, that if he, Satan him&s;elf, was &s;o perfectly de&s;cribed, and &s;o hotly pur&s;ued, he &s;hould certainly be di&s;cover'd. Tho' by the way, I would have you take that Part only <HI>ad referendum,</HI> as the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s call it.</P>
<P>Now it is an unrea&s;onable thing that Men &s;hould make a Bargain with either Man or Devil for more than they are able to perform, and then pretend to blame them for Non-Performance; and therefore a certain noble Lord, now in Exile, (whom they charge with contracting with Satan for &s;ome Parti|cular, in favour of his late <HI>Dumblane</HI> Enterpri&s;e, and which the <HI>Devil</HI> has, it &s;eems, fail'd him in) ought not, as they &s;ay he does, to blame the <HI>De|vil,</HI> who really could do no more for him than he did.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="103">Having then brought it to this Conclu&s;ion, that the <HI>Devil</HI> has been really fir&s;t in the Confederacy, that Satan made the Acquaintance, and that Man neither knew how to come at the <HI>Devil,</HI> nor &s;o much as knew originally that there was any &s;uch thing as a <HI>Devil</HI> in Being, it would add to our more perfect under&s;tanding of the whole Matter, if we could be informed in what manner the Acquain|tance begun.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attack the <HI>Devil</HI> made upon our Mo|ther <HI>Eve,</HI> we have had fully de&s;cribed. Sacred Hi|&s;tory relates the Fact; and hone&s;t, grave Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> has given us the Particulars as di&s;tinctly, and in as lively Colours, as if he had been at the Conference, heard the Court&s;hip, and how cunningly the Devil managed; with what Addre&s;s he in&s;inuated into her weake&s;t Part, and how entirely he conquer'd her Virtue, her Obedience, her Sen&s;e of Religion, brought her to forget the Command that &s;he had but ju&s;t learned to remember; and to &s;acrifice her Soul, and all her Po&s;terity, to her Appetite: I &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> has done it in &s;o lively a manner, that it &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plain, that tho' <HI>Solomon</HI> could not under|&s;tand the way of a Man with a Maid, but placed it among the things that were too wonder|ful for him; <HI>Milton</HI> &s;eems not to be at a Lo&s;s to de&s;cribe the way of the <HI>Devil</HI> with a Woman.</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, we have a di&s;tinct Account how the <HI>Devil</HI> made the fir&s;t Attack upon <HI>Eve</HI> in Pa|radi&s;e; but how he pick'd Acquaintance with the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> after the Deluge, and in what man|ner, or upon what Occa&s;ion that was begun, we are utterly at a lo&s;s about.</P>
<P>Nor have we any hi&s;torical Account who were the Per&s;ons who entertained the fir&s;t Corre&s;pon|dence with him, or upon what Occa&s;ion; nothing appears upon Record to give us the lea&s;t Light into it, other than this, that we find the Effects of

an invi&s;ible <HI>Devil</HI> in <HI>Ham</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> one of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons, and in <HI>Canaan</HI> his Grand&s;on; but it is not the invi&s;ible <HI>Devil</HI> that I am enquiring after, but an appearing conver&s;ible Daemon or Evil Spirit, who a&s;&s;uming human Shape, or at lea&s;t Voice, and in|telligible Operations, could &s;upply the Office of the <HI>Devil</HI> in a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mankind in the &s;everal Exigencies of their Affairs, when any kind of infernal Work was upon their Hands.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, is the <HI>Devil</HI> I am enquiring after; and as I would fain bring Mankind and him to be acquainted together in a decent and regular man|ner, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am at a great Lo&s;s for want of the Particulars, as well of Per&s;ons, as of the Cir|cum&s;tances in which tho&s;e Per&s;ons were concerned.</P>
<P>However &s;ince that Part cannot be entred any farther into, or at lea&s;t not &s;o far as to make a full Di&s;covery, we mu&s;t take up with &s;o much as we find upon Record, and this may perhaps be enough to &s;atisfy us that &s;o it was.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Job,</HI> according to the &s;acred Chro|nology, and by comparing it with other Accounts of things, appears to be very antient; even &s;o old as to be in a very few Years after <HI>Abraham</HI>; for <HI>Eliphaz</HI> the <HI>Temanite</HI> could not, by Calculation, be many Removes from <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>; and <HI>Job</HI> be|ing at that Time an old Man, no le&s;s than a hundred Years old, he might probably be alive within the time of <HI>Japhet,</HI> one of the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI>; for 'tis thought <HI>Job</HI> was above a hundred Years old when his fir&s;t Sorrows came upon him.</P>
<P>Now in the time of <HI>Job,</HI> 'tis evident the <HI>Devil</HI> had made his vi&s;ible Appearances upon Earth, and among the Sons of GOD too; for he appeared before the Lord at the time, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of a &s;olemn Service or Sacrifice. What his Bu&s;ine&s;s was there, and on what Occa&s;ion he came, does not lie before me on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="105">In the next place, the <HI>Devil</HI> not only had per|&s;onally appeared, but it &s;eems plain from the Text, when God had given <HI>Job</HI> into his Hands, that is to &s;ay, had given him Commi&s;&s;ion to fall upon and af|flict him, and that he was gone out from the Pre|&s;ence of God, that he immediately &s;et his human as well as elementary In&s;truments at work; that he rai&s;ed a Storm of Wind, from or in the Wilder|ne&s;s, and blew the Hou&s;e down upon <HI>Job</HI>'s Sons and Daughters; that he brought Thunder and Lightning upon the Flocks, and burnt up the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sheep, and the Servants that look'd after them This was nothing but what, as a <HI>Devil</HI> and a Prince of the Air, might be expected from him: but that was not all; he rai&s;ed War upon him; the <HI>Chaldean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> from one &s;ide, (the North) and the <HI>Sabeans</HI> from ano|ther &s;ide, (the Ea&s;t) made out their Armies and came upon him, and plunder'd him; the fir&s;t carried away the Camels, and the other the Oxen.</P>

I make no que&s;tion but the <HI>Devil</HI> went to them, and told them God had &s;ent him to order them in his Name to ravage the Lands and carry away the Goods of <HI>Job</HI>; that God had de&s;tined him to Mi|&s;ery and Poverty, and had given his E&s;tate to them, and therefore it was lawful for them to fall upon and de&s;troy him and his Family; and to give them a Sign, as I &s;aid before, and that they might know he came with a Commi&s;&s;ion, they &s;hould &s;ee he would go and &s;end down Fire from Heaven and de|&s;troy his Sheep; and if they would not carry off the Camels and the Oxen, he would do the like by tho&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="106">This, and the Bait of Plunder, was enough to ani|mate tho&s;e Nations again&s;t poor <HI>Job,</HI> and &s;o they came immediately and did as the <HI>Devil</HI> directed.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to me to be the fir&s;t vi&s;ible Appea|rance of the <HI>Devil</HI> among the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> in the Po&s;t-diluvean Ages. I will not &s;ay his Acquaintance begun here, tho' if I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it did, I do not &s;ee that I could be contradicted by any authentick Vouchers from Hi&s;tory.

Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>(Arabians) Sabeans</HI>; nor can I doubt but that the <HI>Devil</HI> having made his Acquaintance fir&s;t here, kept his Hold and Intere&s;t among&s;t them upon account of the good Offices he had done them, and perhaps might do them on many other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now, tho' I would not be po&s;itive where there is the lea&s;t Uncertainty, being mighty cautious (as I am at pre&s;ent acting in the Capacity of an Hi|&s;torian) of doing the <HI>Devil</HI> any Wrong or Injury; &s;o I enter my Caveat too again&s;t an Objection here, <HI>viz.</HI> that if this be not the fir&s;t time that any Man gives an Account of Satan's Appearance, and that this was not the fir&s;t of his Pranks which he played upon Mankind after the Flood, let them &s;hew us another before it, if they can; nay, I believe the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf cannot tell us any one Time or Place, or any other Occa&s;ion, on which he ever &s;howed him&s;elf, or perhaps dur&s;t &s;how him&s;elf, in a vi&s;ible Appearance in the World, I mean after the De|luge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of what Shapes the <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;um'd in his fir&s;t Appearances to the <HI>Magicians,</HI> and others, in the Fir&s;t Ages of the World; and whe|ther He is, or has been, allow'd to a&s;&s;ume a Human Shape, or no.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I have ingenuou&s;ly acknowledg'd in my la&s;t Chapter, that I can give you no Account of what Dre&s;s or Shape the Devil appear'd in, when he pre&s;ented him&s;elf among the Sons of God, as noted in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Job,</HI> or whether he was vi&s;ible to any el&s;e but his Maker; &s;o I am equally uncertain in what Figure he made his fir&s;t Appearances afterwards, among his own Acquain|tance and Servants, when he was introduc'd.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore &s;uffice to tell you, that how|ever it was manag'd, we find there was certainly
<PB N="93" REF="108">
an Intelligence carry'd on, a Corre&s;pondence main|tain'd, and what was not perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">onally, was done by Inchantments, which we call Sorcery; by Voices and by Dreams, or by Apparition in &s;uch Shapes and Po&s;tures, as Satan, for Rea&s;ons of State, thought fit to take upon him&s;elf for the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some have doubted, whether the Devil is em|power'd to take up any human Shape, or to appear in the Figure of a Man; and they argue that it does not &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with the Goodne&s;s of the great Father of Mankind, to &s;uffer the Arch-Enemy of his Creatures to go about in &s;uch a Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;o dangerous, and that might be &s;o fatal to him; for that he would be always in danger of being de|ceiv'd to his Hurt, that he could never be &s;afe; but that as the Scripture directs us to be courteous to Strangers, becau&s;e &s;ome by being &s;o had enter|tain'd Angels; &s;o it would make us be &s;hy, and a|fraid of Strangers, for that we &s;hould be always afraid we might receive the Devil into our Hou&s;es, and e&s;pecially into our Friend&s;hip, and Familiarity. And hence I believe came the fooli&s;h empty No|tion, tho' &s;uch as it is impo&s;&s;ible to root out of the Fancies of Men, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Devil cannot ap|pear without his cloven Foot; of which I &s;hall &s;ay nothing here, but that it is a thing &s;o ridiculous as to merit no Notice, either now or at any other time.</P>
<P>Tho' there may be many things &s;aid for this Opi|nion, and particularly to that Part which relates to the Safety of Mankind, in ca&s;e of the &s;everal Di&s;|gui&s;es that the Devil may appear in, yet I cannot exclude the Devil from the Privilege of putting on our Clothes &s;ometimes, and that too perhaps oft|ner than we may think he does; and that he appears in &s;uch a Shape too, oftner than we may believe he does. As to the Danger of it I may &s;peak of that by it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="109">I have taken it for granted in my la&s;t Chapter, that in the fir&s;t Acquaintance between Mankind and the Evil Spirit, after the Deluge, Satan was the Aggre&s;&s;or; that he made his Application to them fir&s;t, made his Propo&s;als of A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help, in the Ca&s;es wherein he knew they wanted his Cor|re&s;pondence; and I &s;hall add, that he perhaps rais'd difficult perplex'd Ca&s;es in the World, on purpo&s;e to prepare the Way for his rendring him|&s;elf u&s;eful.</P>
<P>We are come now to the Manner, I mean How, and in What Way the cunning Manager made his fir&s;t Addre&s;s to Mankind. It is true, we are &s;omething deficient in the Hi&s;tory of this fir&s;t Tran&s;action, becau&s;e we do not yet know, nor can ea&s;ily find out, who was his fir&s;t Corre&s;pon|dent in the World; but if you will take what has been, by what is, and judge of his fir&s;t Method, by his &s;ub&s;equent Practice, I think I may give you room to make a fair Judgment. Nor do I think 'tis an improper way of determining the Point, &s;ince as Satan found the fir&s;t Step &s;ucce&s;sful, 'tis pro|bable he found no occa&s;ion to alter his Mea&s;ures; and tho' differing Circum&s;tances of Place and Per|&s;ons may make him vary a little as he &s;ees Occa|&s;ion, yet I have I think a great deal of rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the general rule of his Practice is much the &s;ame, and that he proceeds upon the &s;ame foot with Mankind in all Ages, and on all Occa&s;ions, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> as he finds the Circum&s;tances of the People the &s;ame, or not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Take then the Devil's fir&s;t Method with Man|kind to be grounded upon his own Experience in his Antediluvean Practices with their Ance&s;tors; upon his Knowledge of their Pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances, I mean Pre&s;ent at the time after the Flood, you mu&s;t allow Satan to have &s;o much Cunning in him, as to be able, without the lea&s;t He&s;itation, to

know what was the be&s;t Method to come about the Man, and how to compa&s;s him; and for that rea&s;on, I &s;ay, I do not allow him to have made any Change in his Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Method then, that I &s;uppo&s;e the Devil took to make his Acquaintance with Man|kind was by the way of Dreams; and here I &s;hall go back &s;o far as to &s;ugge&s;t, that he put <HI>Canaan, Noah</HI>'s Grand&s;on, upon intoxicating the good Patri|arch his Grandfather with Wine: for I join with a late Opinion, that it was <HI>Canaan,</HI> not <HI>Ham,</HI> that was the Occa&s;ion of it; tho' <HI>Ham</HI> was guilty of trium|phing over the old Man, when he was overcome, and expo&s;ing him, as far as lay in him, to his mode|&s;ter Brethren.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then young <HI>Canaan</HI> very bu&s;y, helping and a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Grandfather, in planting and dre&s;&s;ing the Vines after the Flood, and in gathering the Fruit; take then the following Ob&s;ervations upon tho&s;e Circum&s;tances in particular.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I cannot come into that fooli&s;h Notion, that <HI>Noah</HI> did not under&s;tand the Nature of the Vine, or the Strength of the Juice, when the Grapes were pre&s;s'd, and the Wine ran out, and that he drank it ignorantly; I &s;ay, I cannot come into that Opinion: For <HI>Noah,</HI> who had no doubt preach'd again&s;t the Vices of the Antediluvian World, and again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s among the re&s;t, mu&s;t certainly know the U&s;e of the Vine, and the Abu&s;e of it too; how el&s;e did he come to plant it at all, and to pre&s;s the Juice out for Drinking it at all?</P>
<P>Gen. ix.20. <HI>Noah began to be an Husbandman, and he planted a Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>21. <HI>And he drank of the Wine, and was drunken.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It does not &s;eem, that the time of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Drunkenne&s;s was upon the pre&s;&s;ing of the Grapes, or the pre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t Grapes of his new Planta|tion; it mu&s;t certainly be a con&s;iderable time after
<PB N="96" REF="111">
his planting them, and after his fir&s;t making of Wine. For tho' 'tis very probable that he planted the Vines immediately after the Flood, and the Text &s;eems to intimate as much; yet 'tis evident it mu&s;t be many Years after that, when he fell into the &s;nare of Drunkenne&s;s. For <HI>Canaan,</HI> who was the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Man grown, was not Born at the coming out of the <HI>Ark,</HI> and there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t twenty or thirty Years between that time and the Fact For if <HI>Canaan</HI> had not been Major, had not been at Man's E&s;tate, he would not in probability have been curs'd by his Grandfather, as a Principal in the Crime, as it is evident he was: For it does not &s;eem that he was cur&s;ed &s;o particularly, as an Ac|ce&s;&s;ary only, or for the meer Offence of his Fa|ther, nor would it have been Righteous in <HI>Noah</HI> to have done &s;o. But as he is &s;o warmly fallen up|on, and &s;o particularly by the old Patriarch, in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Anathema,</HI> 'tis very probable he was a Principal in the Fact of abu&s;ing him.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then, I &s;ay, young <HI>Canaan</HI> bu&s;y in a&s;|&s;i&s;ting his Grandfather in planting and dre&s;&s;ing the Vines, and in pre&s;&s;ing the Fruit; the Devil takes this for a Handle, and &s;ubtly makes <HI>Canaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> dream. (For I'll grant, with Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> that the Devil had, from the Beginning, the Art of whi&s;|pering to him in his Sleep, as that Author makes him do to <HI>Eve</HI> in Paradi&s;e, and thereby making him dream of any thing he pleas'd.) Take him the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whi&s;pering to <HI>Canaan,</HI> that he &s;hould make his Grandfather drunk with the Wine, and that he &s;hould be able to do what he pleas'd with him ever after; in&s;inuating, that the Effect of it would be to make his Grandfather have a greater Affecti|on to him than to any of the re&s;t of his Grand|children. This is not improbable, becau&s;e the De|vil always Tempts with the Expectation of &s;ome apparent Good.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="112">Others &s;ugge&s;t, that <HI>Noah</HI> having reprov'd and reproach'd <HI>Canaan</HI> for &s;ome Crime, and perhaps caus'd him to be corrected for it, the Devil took hold of his Re&s;entment, (which, by the way, is not much unlike a Devil,) and propos'd this method of Revenge to him in a Dream; as if he had dream'd that he had prevail'd over his Grandfather, by per|&s;uading him to drink him&s;elf drunk, and had there|by made him expo&s;e him&s;elf in a bea&s;tly manner, 'till he became the Ridicule and Je&s;t of the whole Family, which by that time was very numerous; and that <HI>Canaan,</HI> plea&s;ed with the lively Repre&s;entation of his Grandfather's Shame, re&s;olv'd (the Devil prompting him to it in other &s;ub&s;equent Dreams) if po&s;&s;ible, to give him&s;elf the Satisfaction of bringing it to pa&s;s, and to per&s;uade the old Man to drink him&s;elf Drunk, the next time he came to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the Bu&s;ine&s;s; and that accordingly he did &s;o, and prevail'd.</P>
<P>Whether Satan did it thus, or by any other me|thod of In&s;inuation, we are not &s;ure; but it is very probable it was by a Dream: Nor is it clear to me, that the Devil had ever any other way but by Dream or Apparition, to come at the intelligent Faculties of Man. 'Tis evident he does &s;ugge&s;t Evil; now he mu&s;t do it &s;leeping, or waking; if &s;leeping, it mu&s;t be by a Dream, in which he does but imitate the good Spirit, which, as the Scripture &s;ays plainly, and gives a multitude of In&s;tances of it, opens the Under&s;tandings of Men in the Night Vi&s;ions, and &s;eals their In&s;tructions: Nor is it a new Practice of Satan to mimick and imitate his Maker, in the Mea&s;ures and Operations of his Wi&s;dom with Mankind.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, we are &s;ure the Devil does communicate his malicious Propo&s;als of Mi&s;chief to Mankind; you have two eminent Examples of
<PB N="98" REF="113">
it in Scripture, which are too plain, and too direct to my purpo&s;e here, to admit any Di&s;pute; fir&s;t, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and his Project of numbring the Poeple, 'tis &s;aid expre&s;ly, 1 Chron. xxi 1. <HI>Satan moved David to number the People.</HI> Where, by the way, tho' it was his Sin, yet by it we gain a piece of Information, how prodigiou&s;ly populous the Tribes were at that time, <HI>viz.</HI> that there were fifteen hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and fighting Men in only ten of the Tribes; an incredible Number to inhabit &s;o &s;mall a Spot of Ground as the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> be&s;ides Women and Children: But that by the way.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Example, which renders it out of all doubt that Satan has Acce&s;s to the Thoughts of Men, is that of <HI>Judas,</HI> John xiii.2. <HI>Satan put it into the Heart of</HI> Judas <HI>to betray Chri&s;t.</HI> Now, I &s;ay as above&punc; this mu&s;t be done &s;leeping, or waking; if &s;leeping&punc; it mu&s;t be by Dreams; if waking, it mu&s;t be by Voice, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or Apparition. We &s;hall con&s;ider them all in their Place.</P>
<P>It is probable that the fir&s;t Method the Devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> took in the World was by Dream; as for Po&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ion, we do not meet with it very early; as to Voic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Apparition, we take them to be all &s;ub&s;equen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the Effect of a long Acquaintance: as amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Men there are &s;everal degrees of Communicatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with one another, after Men have a Per&s;onal Know+ledge and Acquaintance, before it comes up to <HI>Inti+macy</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="99" REF="114">Thus I cannot think but the Devil fir&s;t put it into the Hearts of the Men of the old World to go about that ridiculous piece of Work (as I ob&s;erv'd it to be before) of building of <HI>Babel</HI>; fir&s;t by fill|ing their Thoughts with daily Terrors and Appre|hen&s;ions of another Inundation, thronging their &s;leeping Imaginations with Fancies of new Rains to overflow them; by which, every time they had any ha&s;ty Showers which rais'd the Water of the Rivers or Brooks to what we call a Land-Flood, they would be immediately alarm'd as if another Deluge was a coming upon them, and that they were immediately to be drown'd.</P>
<P>Thus rai&s;ing the Vapours in their Hypocon|drias, they were every Night dreaming that they heard it Thunder, that they &s;aw heavy Rains, and that the Brooks and Rivers &s;well'd, or as we &s;ay in our common Di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, <HI>the Waters were out</HI>; in Con&s;equence of this, he puts them upon con&s;idering of Means for their own Se|curity, and then they dream every Night of Me|thods: One while they are for building another Ark, another time for building a Thou&s;and, that is to &s;ay, an Ark for every Family, or Patriarchate, or Tribe; one time this fooli&s;h thing, and ano|ther time that; and perhaps many Men dreaming on many &s;everal Methods, till at la&s;t they bring their &s;leeping Cogitations to a waking Con&s;ultation; and there they re&s;olve upon the meane&s;t, emptye&s;t, and mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent Project, that ever any Body of Men form'd in their Heads: And which, if the Devil had not been in them, and drawn them into it, as I &s;ay, meerly to impo&s;e upon, and expo&s;e them even to their own Ridicule, could never have come into their Heads, I mean the Building of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="115">If the Devil did excite that fooli&s;h Imagination, he mu&s;t do it as he was a meer Devil, to &s;how his Malice, to put them upon doing &s;ome|thing extremely Ridiculous, and which &s;hould at la&s;t expo&s;e them to their own Re&s;entments on the Madne&s;s and Folly of it; or, which I rather think, he bewilder'd their Imaginations, without any im|mediate Pro&s;pect, other than this, that he knew it would end in &s;ome ridiculous Undertaking, either very <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> or very <HI>wicked</HI>; not knowing which it would be, and perhaps not much caring, &s;o it would be but provoking to their Maker, and what might any way bring his Di&s;plea&s;ure upon them.</P>

<P>What a piece of Folly would the fruitle&s;s Toil have been, how would they have reproach'd them|&s;elves, and perhaps falling out, and going together by the Ears about it, the Victors would have made the Vanqui&s;h'd pull it down, and carry away the Materials, that the Monument of their Shame might be removed out of their Sight.

the Devil at that time any other way to bring it to pa&s;s but by Dreams, at lea&s;t not as we know of.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erv'd, that the fir&s;t Conver&s;e of Mankind with the invi&s;ible World, whether with the evil Spirits, or with the Good, or even with their Maker him&s;elf, was by Dreams; and therefore it is not improbable that Satan made his Applica|tion to them the &s;ame way: We have it very early mention'd, <HI>Gen.</HI> xv.1. <HI>The Word of the Lord came to Abram in a Vi&s;ion,</HI> that is a Dream; and again, <HI>A deep &s;leep fell upon Abram, and lo a horrour of great Darkne&s;s fell upon him, and he &s;aid unto him</HI>&mdash;ver. 12, 13.</P>
<P>It is in &s;ome particular Texts &s;aid <HI>the Lord appeared to Abram,</HI> which if interpreted by other Places, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be in <HI>a Dream</HI>; for in tho&s;e Places, when God convers'd by Apparition with <HI>Abram,</HI> or call'd to him by Voice, it is di&s;tingui&s;h'd expre&s;ly in &s;o many Words, that <HI>God &s;aid</HI>; and <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> went up from talking with Abram</HI>; and <HI>the Lord appeared to him in the Door of his Tent</HI>; and the like.</P>
<P>As God him&s;elf took this Method with <HI>Abram,</HI> and &s;o with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and &s;o with many others, both before and &s;ince; &s;o the Devil found means to make his Addre&s;s to Mankind by the &s;ame way. Hence we find a mighty great Stre&s;s laid upon &s;ome of the Dreams of the Ancients in tho&s;e Days; and much ado was made about the Interpretation of them: For when once a Man of Note had dream'd any Important Dream, any Dream which &s;eem'd to have &s;omething extraordinary in it, away they went to their Cunning Men, their South&s;ayers and <HI>Magicians,</HI> to enquire of them the Meaning and Interpretation of the&s;e Dreams.</P>
<P>Now bring all the&s;e Circum&s;tances together, and you will find the Devil &s;ubtily in&s;inuating Dreams
<PB N="103" REF="118">
into the Heads of Princes and Great Men, and then by like Dreams communicating to his Cor|re&s;pondents tho&s;e very Dreams, and what Interpre|tations they &s;hould make of them.</P>
<P>This was a particular Favour done in Aid of tho&s;e <HI>Magicians,</HI> who were more than ordinarily in his good Graces; and no doubt it gave them a particu|lar Reputation at Court, and in the Opinion of the People; as having a more than ordinary Under&s;tanding in hidden Matters, or having a very particular In|telligence in the &s;ecret and re&s;erv'd Part of Nature, or a Corre&s;pondence in the World of Spirits.</P>

<P>This was very obliging in the Devil, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, if the Story be true; and <HI>Ali</HI> was very &s;en&s;ible of the Help it was to him, and fail'd not to ask the Vi&s;ion how he &s;hould obtain his pro|mis'd A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the like Ca&s;es of Difficulty. Upon which the Vi&s;ion told him, that whenever he wanted his Help, he &s;hould come again to the Palm-tree, and that &s;urrounding the Tree fifteen times, he &s;hould call him aloud by his Name three times, every time he went round the Tree; and at the end of the fifteenth time he &s;hould find Sleepi|ne&s;s come upon him, when he &s;hould lay him&s;elf down as he did now, with his Face to the South; and if he fell a&s;leep, he &s;hould be &s;ure to receive a Vi&s;it from him in Vi&s;ion: and with this he gives him the Magick Name which he was to call him by.</P>
<P><HI>Ali</HI> was infinitely exalted with the thoughts of this Information, which let him &s;o much into the Secret of Nature, as to enable him to &s;peak in a Dialect infinitely &s;uperior to the common Under|&s;tanding, and in particular to make a Judgment of things, out of the reach of the mo&s;t Pretending of the re&s;t of his fellow <HI>Magicians.</HI> When he went home among the People, he fail'd not to give his Judgment of the terrible Appearance in the Air, and told them po&s;itively it portended a great Drought and Heat in the approaching Summer; to which he added, as a Sugge&s;tion only, that he had great rea&s;on to believe it would be attended
<PB N="108" REF="123">
with a Famine, and perhaps the Famine might be follow'd with a Plague; in&s;inuating, that if the Famine was not attended with a Plague among his own Countrymen, as he had &s;aid it would, it was then likely it would appear fir&s;t in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> their Neighbouring Kingdom, and perhaps it might af|terwards &s;pread among them.</P>
<P>This terrible Prediction, deliver'd with the Au|thority of one whom they had the Venerable Opi|nion of before as a <HI>Magician,</HI> and one that could foretel Events of things, gave the People an Alarm, and al&s;o their King with them, to whom the News of the Prediction was &s;oon carry'd; but the <HI>Magician</HI> conceal'd entirely from their Knowledge the Manner of his obtaining his Information, &s;o that it came to them on the &s;ingle Authority of his own Judgment.</P>
<P>It happen'd as a Confirmation of his Prediction, that after the Meteor ceas'd to appear, and the Spring Sea&s;on advanc'd, an extreme hot Sea&s;on came on, with a long Drought following for &s;eve|ral Weeks, which began very much to burn up the Fruits of the Earth; immediately the People remembring the Words of the <HI>Magician,</HI> and find|ing &s;o much of what he had &s;aid prove true, it put them in a great Con&s;ternation from the Ap|prehen&s;ion of what, according to his Account, was yet to follow.</P>
<P>It happen'd &s;ome time after this, that the King of the Country dreamed a Dream, which much perplex'd him, and all the Magicians and A&s;trolo|gers were &s;ent for, to interpret the &s;aid Dream; but <HI>Ali</HI> was not &s;ent for, which grieved him much, thinking that he was not e&s;teem'd enough among the Princes of the Country, and that he fear'd his having foretold the portentous Events of the late Meteor, which were not yet determin'd by the time that he
<PB N="109" REF="124">
predicted, he was neglected, as a Per&s;on that would not give any good Interpretation of the King's Dream. However, when <HI>Ali</HI> &s;aw that the <HI>Magi|cians</HI> and South&s;ayers, who were &s;ent for, gave the King no Satisfaction; for they were confounded in their Accounts, and differ'd one from another, and the King was &s;o angry, that he was about to command them all to be put to Death; with this he was comforted again, and re&s;olv'd to apply him|&s;elf to the Palm-tree, to &s;ee if he could furni&s;h him|&s;elf with any Intelligence &s;uitable to what he de|&s;ir'd; in which Ca&s;e he would &s;oon let the King know, that though the re&s;t of the <HI>Magicians</HI> could not an&s;wer his De&s;ire, he could &s;upply that Defect; and &s;o he &s;hould gain more Reputation, than if he had been &s;ent for with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon this, he retires him&s;elf as u&s;ual into the De&s;art as before, and comes to the Spot where he had the fir&s;t Vi&s;ion. Here he &s;urrounds the Tree fifteen times, and every time calls the Spectre by his appointed Name three times over, and as loud as his utmo&s;t extended Voice would admit; when, according to Direction, he laid him&s;elf down with his Face to the South, &s;hut his Eyes, and ob&s;equiou&s;ly waited till he fell a&s;leep, which was not long: No &s;ooner had his Sen&s;es for&s;aken him, whether doz'd with any infernal Charm or otherwi&s;e, the Account does not &s;pecify: But, I &s;ay, no &s;ooner was he a&s;leep, but the Vi&s;ion appeared to his Fancy, and asked him what was the Occa&s;ion of his coming.</P>
<P>He an&s;wer'd, That the King had dreamed a Dream, and had told it to the Magicians, whom he &s;ent for in order to have them interpret his Dream, but that he had not been &s;ent for, which was at fir&s;t very grieving to him; but that upon further En|quiry he found that the Magicians had given the
<PB N="110" REF="125">
King no Satisfaction; and that it had highly pro|voked him, &s;o that he was going once to have killed them all, and that now he was glad he was not called; but that if he could now put him into a Condition to interpret the King's Dream, it would e&s;tabli&s;h his Reputation for ever, not with the King only, but with the whole Country, for that he was &s;ure to be exalted to the highe&s;t Pitch of Honour that the King could give; and be&s;ides, all the People would adore him as one that had Intelligence among the Gods; &s;o that he &s;hould be had in the highe&s;t Reverence imaginable.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;ion a&s;&s;ured him that he could not only qualify him to interpret the King's Dream, but that he had made the King dream it on &s;et Purpo&s;e to to give him Occa&s;ion to interpret and explain it; and &s;o he let him into the Particulars of what it was the King had dreamed; and that the Dream being thus directed by him, he likewi&s;e could di|rect him to &s;uch an Interpretation as none but him&s;elf could put upon it; and &s;o he at once told him both what the King dreamed, and what Interpretation he &s;hould give of it; adding, that he would yet do greater things for him than tho&s;e; for that if he had Occa&s;ion to recommend him&s;elf to the King, or to any other Per&s;on of Note, he would put it into his Power at any time, not only to tell the King what his Dream &s;ignified, but &s;hould make the King Dream any thing that he thought fit; &s;o that he &s;hould be able to &s;ay to the King, To-morrow Night a deep Sleep &s;hall come upon you, and you &s;hall dream &s;o and &s;o, which Dream &s;hall portend &s;uch and &s;uch things to you and your People.</P>
<P><HI>Ali</HI> was exceedingly rai&s;ed in his Thoughts upon &s;uch a Motion as this, and you will not wonder
<PB N="111" REF="126">
that he expre&s;&s;ed, tho' in his Sleep or Vi&s;ion, his high Satisfaction at &s;uch a Favour; and from that time he entertained a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence with this Vi&s;ion or Apparition, not being aware, or per|haps not concerned, that he was all this while con|ver&s;ing with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that the new Friend|&s;hip he had engaged in, was neither le&s;s or more than an immediate Corre&s;pondence with Hell.</P>
<P>We have a Parallel Story to this, and almo&s;t of the &s;ame kind, of the Devil and an old <HI>Arabian</HI> in the Court of a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> upon the Appearance of a Comet or Blazing Star, and of which I &s;hall give an Account in its Place.</P>
<P>Nor was this any thing extraordinary in tho&s;e Times; 'twas natural to Satan's way of conver|&s;ing with Mankind, who had frequently midnight Thoughts injected to them by a &s;upernatural Power, that is, by the evil Spirit, without their knowing by what Hand they were injected; and the <HI>Devil</HI> was able mo&s;t certainly to give the In|terpretation of tho&s;e Thoughts which he had been the Occa&s;ion of.</P>
<P>This whole Affair, tho' remote in Time, I give this Account of, to &s;ugge&s;t from it the proba|ble Method which Satan has taken from the Be|ginning to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into Mankind; and, as I &s;aid before, to begin the Acquaintance; which, when once begun, he took particular Care to cultivate to all the degrees of Intimacy po&s;&s;ible; &s;o that in few Years, &s;uch People have been as in|timate with the <HI>Devil,</HI> tho' perhaps not thoroughly knowing who it was they conver&s;ed with, as they could de&s;ire to be.</P>
<P>By this Method he found Opportunities, upon all Occa&s;ions, to bring Men to conver&s;e freely and fully with him; and as he often furni&s;hed them with Materials and Subjects to amu&s;e the re&s;t of the
<PB N="112" REF="127">
World with, he was always able to oblige them in the utmo&s;t manner: &s;eeing nothing could be more to the Satisfaction of &s;uch People than the rai&s;ing their Reputation in their Profe&s;&s;ion, and giving a Sanction or Confirmation to their Predictions.</P>
<P>I know it is doubted by many among the Learn|ed, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> has him&s;elf any Knowledge of Futurity, and whether he can predict or fore|tell Events, or any thing future and to come; and this very Vi&s;ion or Apparition, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true, verifies the Opinion; for he put the Alter|native &s;everal times upon him, that &s;o if he mi&s;s'd giving a right Interpretation in one thing, he might be &s;ure in another; and if one Conjecture &s;hould mi&s;s, another might hit, as you &s;ee in the Con&s;truction of the appearing Body of Fire.</P>
<P>But the Que&s;tion is needle&s;s here; for if it be in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Power to inject the Subject of a Dream, and put Thoughts into the Heads of tho&s;e that are a&s;leep, 'tis then mo&s;t certainly &s;o far in his Power to give the Interpretation of tho&s;e Thoughts to whom he plea&s;es to grant &s;uch a Favour; &s;eeing the whole Scheme may be a meer Cheat and De|lu&s;ion of the evil Spirit, on purpo&s;e to form another Delu&s;ion, namely, that of bringing in a Conjurer or Dreamer of Dreams to interpret it. This is in|deed a true Piece of the Legerdemain of Hell, and it may be called, <HI>the Devil turned Juggler</HI>; for 'tis &s;o in the very Ab&s;tract, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>All this is no great matter for Satan to do, if we grant him only the Power of infu&s;ing Midnight Thoughts into the Mind, which we have good rea&s;on to believe he is able enough to perform, and yet have no great matter of Craft in him neither, not &s;o much as we are ordinarily willing to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> is Ma&s;ter of. The Variety is in|finite, that I might &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> is capable to
<PB N="113" REF="128">
act among his Di&s;ciples by this piece of Cunning, if we do but allow him &s;o much; and I cannot but &s;ay 'tis very clear to me, that the <HI>Devil</HI> has a &s;ecret Power to inject innumerable things into our Heads by Dream, and to make us dream almo&s;t what, and when he plea&s;es, &s;o as may be&s;t &s;erve his Occa&s;ions, and Ours too.</P>
<P>And his Advantages are very great by this Fraud, for he gives his In&s;trument &s;uch an undoubted Re|putation for a Revealer of Secrets and an Interpre|ter of Dreams, that nothing can be like it. Not <HI>Daniel</HI> him&s;elf, who they &s;aid had an excellent Spi|rit, and that the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him, could do more; for by this Means, the South|&s;ayer would be able to tell the Dreamer what it was he dreamed of, as well as what it &s;ignified.</P>
<P>If any Man doubt that the <HI>Devil</HI> can, as I &s;ay, infu&s;e midnight Thoughts, and whi&s;per Sugge&s;ti|ons by Dream of any kind to the Mind, I refer him to Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> who &s;hews us the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Shape of a Toad crept clo&s;e to <HI>Eve</HI>'s Ear in her deepe&s;t Slumbers, and injecting lu&s;tful or loo&s;e and wandering Thoughts into her cha&s;te Mind, (I &s;ay cha&s;te, for &s;uch it was without doubt before) and making her dream with Plea&s;ure of the Sin which he re&s;olved to allure her to commit the next Day, and &s;o prepare her for the Crime, which till then her very Soul ab|horred.</P>
<P>This granted, and the <HI>Devil</HI> being allowed &s;uch an Advantage over Mankind, whether good or bad; I cannot wonder either that he makes u&s;e of it at all, or that he makes u&s;e of it in &s;uch a frequent and extraordinary manner as to bewitch and in|&s;pire his Friends and Favourites: Nor that tho&s;e Friends or Favourites of his, whom he does thus a&s;&s;i&s;t, make &s;uch corrupt u&s;es of it as we find they do, for in&s;inuating an Opinion of them&s;elves into the World: for we find pre&s;ently, when this Fami|liarity
<PB N="114" REF="129">
is once obtained with the Evil Spirit, and they begin to act by his In&s;truction, the fir&s;t thing they do is, to put a Fraud upon Mankind, and make the World believe that all they did was from Heaven; that they &s;poke by In&s;piration and Reve|lation, and that their Intelligence was immediately from the Gods; to &s;peak in the Language of tho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Times.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Balaam</HI> tells the King of <HI>Moab,</HI> he can &s;peak nothing but as God &s;hall command him; wherea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 'tis plain, had not the <HI>Devil</HI> been re&s;trained from directing him at that time, he would as heartily have cur&s;ed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as he ble&s;&s;ed them, and &s;o have gained the Rewards of his Office, which was the Wages of Divination; but he confe&s;&s;es the Impo|tency of his Art, when he found a Lock put upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tongue, and the Key in the Hand of a &s;upream Power; I &s;ay, he confe&s;&s;es the good Will he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Reward, but the Weakne&s;s of his <HI>Black-A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> where Heaven interpo&s;ed its Power, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxiii. 23. <HI>Surely there is no Inchantment again&s;t Jacob, nei|ther is there any Divination again&s;t I&s;rael:</HI> intimating, that he had tryed the utmo&s;t of his Skill, but could do nothing; and in <HI>ver.</HI> 20. <HI>Behold I have receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commandment to ble&s;s, and he hath ble&s;&s;ed, and I can|not rever&s;e it:</HI> Nothing can be plainer, He would, but the <HI>Devil</HI> and he together were not able to re|ver&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ing. The only thing &s;trange in this Story of <HI>Balaam</HI> is, that God &s;hould thus &s;uffer a Sorcerer and Inchanter, a Witch or Dealer with the <HI>Devil,</HI> to receive Commands from him&s;elf, and to bid him go and do thus and thus, and to meet him, and put into his Mouth what he &s;hould &s;ay on that Occa&s;ion; from whence &s;ome might in&s;i|nuate, that the Wizards and Magicians of tho&s;e Days had a mutual or alternate Conver&s;e, &s;ome|times really with God him&s;elf, and at other times with the <HI>Devil</HI>; as if the Wretch were to day a

<P>By this means the People al&s;o were the more ea&s;ily &s;ubjected to the Abu&s;e of the Conjurer, and expo&s;ed to the Delu&s;ions of an evil Spirit, not being able to know when he &s;poke from One or from the Other; no doubt the Deluder would always pretend he &s;poke by the immediate Illumi|nation of Heaven, as he had &s;ometimes really done &s;o, it would not be difficult to obtain the Opi|nion that he did always &s;o.</P>
<P>Now 'tis mo&s;t certain that nothing can more a&s;&s;i&s;t the Delu&s;ions of the <HI>Devil</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, than to have it entertained among the Peo|ple, that all the In&s;piration is from Heaven; even the Devil him&s;elf cannot de&s;ire a &s;tronger Auxi|liar; it is an A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o natural to the Delu&s;ions which he is carrying on among Men, that all his infernal Art cannot form an Equivalent to it.

And behold the Lord &s;tood above it and &s;aid, <HI>I am the Lord God of Abraham thy Father.</HI> But if this will not do neither, then take it with one who it might be as likely &s;hould have the <HI>Devil</HI> appear to him as God him&s;elf, but &s;till 'twas the &s;ame thing, <HI>Gen.</HI> xx.3. <HI>God came to Abimelech in a Dream</HI>; So might the <HI>Devil</HI> too, for <HI>Abimelech</HI> was an Idolater: And again, <HI>ver.</HI> 6. <HI>And God &s;aid unto him in a Dream.</HI> Now <HI>Abimelech</HI> was a <HI>Phili&s;tin</HI> of the cur&s;ed Race de&s;tined to De&s;truction by the Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and yet God appeared to him, or came to him in a Dream, and &s;poke to him in a Dream.</P>
<P>From hence the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is cunning enough to imitate all tho&s;e Methods of Acce&s;s to the Minds of Man, which 'tis po&s;&s;ible for him to come at him by, and which his Maker has u&s;ed for the like Communications, has always made u&s;e of this Method; and when he has de&s;igned the Delu&s;ion, or the perplexing of Mankind, or any other of his infernal Infatuations, he has brought them to pa&s;s by the Injection of evil Thoughts or other dark Means, moving his Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, in&s;tilling all the helli&s;h Imaginations that are requi&s;ite to the Mi&s;chiefs he de&s;igns. And thus you have the Cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="119" REF="134">
and the Rea&s;on too, of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s way of working with Mankind.</P>
<P>It remains a Que&s;tion, tho' of no extraordinary Importance, what Shape or Form the <HI>Devil</HI> made u&s;e of in his fir&s;t acquainting him&s;elf with Man|kind. It is Satan's Misfortune, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of him, that he cannot appear in his own Figure, cloathed with any of his native Beauties; but that it would render him &s;o frightful to his Emi&s;&s;aries, and even his be&s;t Friends and mo&s;t u&s;eful Ser|vants would be terrified, and would run away from him in&s;tead of conver&s;ing with him; and the mo&s;t accurate Magician or South&s;ayer in <HI>Arabia</HI> would, in&s;tead of going into the De&s;erts and Wilderne&s;s to meet him, abhor the very Place, and tremble at the Thought of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>Hence, to whi&s;per to them in the Night, and only talk in Vi&s;ion and Appearance, is the kinde&s;t thing the <HI>Devil</HI> can do to them, as well as the wi&s;e&s;t way for him&s;elf; for was he ever to appeal, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> in his own Cloaths, none of his Friends would ever come to receive his &s;econd Vi&s;it. Now his coming in the Night, or in Dream, as is hinted in the Story of the Magician above, is certainly needful; for as in a Dream the Voice without the Vi&s;ion is &s;ufficient, &s;o if a Shape is repre&s;ented to the Imagination in the Sleep it &s;ooner wears off, and the Impre&s;&s;ions are &s;ooner raz'd out of the Mind, than if the Apparition was vi&s;ible with open Eyes, and in the Light of the Day; there's a great deal of difference between what we really &s;ee, and what we only dream we did &s;ee.</P>
<P>We have indeed &s;ome of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s Dreamers, that is to &s;ay, who dream with their Eyes open; indeed &s;ome of them may be &s;aid to be always in a Dream, they are &s;carce any thing but Apparition them&s;elves; their whole Lives are a kind of moral Delu&s;ion; and as they live in a Dream, &s;o we
<PB N="120" REF="135">
mu&s;t dream too, to make any thing of them, for they never are what they &s;eem to be, or &s;eem to be what they are. But as I may perhaps endeavour to di&s;cover tho&s;e People to the World, a little plainer than I can di&s;cover them to them&s;elves, I &s;ay no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them in this Place, leaving the <HI>De|vil</HI> and them to act in Concert a-while, that they may illu&s;trate, and be Foils to one another.</P>
<P>It is true that by this way of dealing in Dreams, the <HI>Devil</HI> has infinite Advantage, for the making C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|jurers, that is to &s;ay, Magicians and South&s;ayers, in the World: Whether that &s;ort of People have been of any U&s;e to him for the propagating his Intere&s;t in the World, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Devil</HI> took this Method for the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf in the World, and, as I call'd it, making his Acquaintance with Mankind, I have ta|ken Notice of already: How u&s;eful he has found his new-made Friends, and how apt to carry on his Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and e&s;pecially for the farther extending his Power, and propagating the Delu&s;ions of others, Hi|&s;tory will inform us; and we cannot doubt but he has found his Advantage in it: But it remains a Que&s;tion of Importance &s;till undecided, whether are be&s;t plea&s;ed in the&s;e nocturnal Operations, the Devil or the Magician; my Opinion is for the fir&s;t. I believe indeed the <HI>Devil</HI> has got the better of them in the main, and whereas he at fir&s;t was mighty eager to make his Acquaintance among them, and glad of the Means; he &s;eems now to have over-reached them, and to have worked them up to a De&s;ire after the Corre&s;pon|dence in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;ubtle Manager is not &s;o cheap to be had &s;ince, but makes Bargains, nay, brings them up to his own Terms, and &s;ometimes tells them plainly, he has no Occa&s;ion for them; but on the other hand, if they want him, they mu&s;t give him his own Price, and do what he con|ditions with them for, or el&s;e he has no more to &s;ay to them, tho' he is a Cheat in that too.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="136">Thus like a cunning Chap, he turns his Back and is gone, knowing very well that they will call him again, and give him his Price; yield to his Demand, and rather &s;ell them&s;elves to him <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> as we are told is now very frequent, than go without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. This is all owing to his Subtilty, and Mankind's Folly and Fondne&s;s; for had they &s;tood as they did at fir&s;t, he mu&s;t have come to their Conditions; but he found the way to make him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to them, and to plea&s;e them, and he managed accordingly.</P>
<P>It is indeed an Evidence how &s;hrewdly the <HI>Devil</HI> over-reached Mankind in the mo&s;t early Ages of the World: For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as I mentioned before, this was to come to them with &s;ome Authority, and with the Magnificence of a God, and it always gave them an Awe and kind of Reverence of his Appearance; <HI>Secondly,</HI> it really &s;o far prevail'd with them, that we have a great deal of Rea&s;on to believe they did not always know whether their Intelligence was from Above or from Below, and whether they were conver&s;ing with God or with the <HI>Devil</HI>; If this is true, as I have no Rea&s;on to que&s;tion, I have le&s;s Rea&s;on to doubt that he of|ten deluded them to think the former. And thus perhaps many fal&s;e Prophets in former times came to the poor People, and began their Predictions with the u&s;ual Preface, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord</HI>; when in Ju&s;tice they ought to have begun with, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Devil,</HI> as they might ea&s;ily have &s;een after|wards, by the Con&s;equence of it, and by the nature of their Prediction; for I believe that way it is mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Di&s;covery &s;eems indeed to be directed by this very Method, where the Scripture &s;ays. <HI>If a Prophet comes, &s;hews Signs and Wonders,</HI> and then adds, <HI>go &s;erve other Gods,</HI> his very Doctrine proves him to be an Impo&s;tor, and on that very Account
<PB N="122" REF="137">
he is to be rejected: God's Prophets will always teach God's Truths, a fal&s;e Prophet is ea&s;ily known by his Teachings; the <HI>Devil</HI> may deceive for a while, but even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf cannot hold it long, the cloven Principle will appear, which I &s;uppo&s;e the Fable of the cloven Foot to be an Em|blem of, and no more.</P>
<P>But to come back to the Example of the Magi|cian going into the De&s;art; why, the very Place was a Branch of that Complication of Fraud which con&s;tituted all the re&s;t: The Man went thither fir&s;t ca&s;ually, fell a&s;leep by the natural Con&s;equence of his Wearine&s;s, and under the Palm-tree, as cu|&s;tomary, to pre&s;erve him by its Shade; the re&s;t was all a Cheat; the <HI>Devil</HI> could as well have made him dream and &s;ee the Vi&s;ion in his Cham|ber at <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> or where el&s;e he dwelt in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Arabia,</HI> as in the Wilderne&s;s; but he catch'd him there, and took that Advantage, to introduce the Ceremony of his future corre&s;ponding; and therefore he appoints him to come again to the &s;ame Place, and there gives him the Formality of Mea&s;ures to be ob&s;erved; he mu&s;t make his Tour fifteen times round the Tree; he mu&s;t call him by what infernal Title he was plea&s;ed to give him&s;elf; and this to be done three times every Circuit he made about the Tree; and when all this was done, as he might well be inclined to do, he was to lie down and go to &s;leep. And what need all this Cookery, but to di&s;h up the Delu&s;ion with a due Form, give a Sanction to the Vi&s;ion it&s;elf, and command a &s;uitable Regard to the Audience which he had the Honour to be admitted to?</P>
<P>If this had not been the ca&s;e, it might as well have all been tran&s;acted any where el&s;e; but Satan finds his Account in the&s;e things: For during many Ages after this, and perhaps in other Places, the South&s;ayers and Magicians of <HI>Arabia,</HI> went out in the

Night, and into the Wilderne&s;s, and Solitary Places, to meet with their In&s;pirations, and to dream Dreams, and then came back, &s;tor'd and qualify'd to make their Predictions; as much as to &s;ay, they go to their Palm-trees, to meet Vi&s;ions; there they met their <HI>Devil,</HI> and then came back, and &s;pread their Delu&s;ions, as their In&s;tructor had furni&s;h'd them.</P>

Nor do I doubt at all but that they made Prodigies, and then explain'd their Meaning, as I &s;aid before; that they appointed Dreams on pur|po&s;e, and for the &s;ake of interpreting them; of which I &s;hall give you another Account hereafter.</P>
<P>Sometimes it &s;eems, the&s;e conjuring, enchanting People, were &s;o far from explaining things to the Queen's Mind, or interpreting things after the man|ner that &s;he expected, that her Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to di&s;patch them out of her way, and hang them

And when <HI>Micaiah,</HI> a true Prophet, or Prophet of God, came to tell the King what really came to pa&s;s, we &s;ee what his Fate had been, if the King had out-liv'd the Battle.</P>
<P>Nor to this Day do the Princes of the Ea&s;t make any &s;cruple to tru&s;s up their Conjurers and South&s;ayers, when they find them juggle with them, and find they cheat and impo&s;e upon them; an admirable Method to deal with the Broachers of Athei&s;tical, Dei&s;tical, and Enthu&s;ia&s;tic Whym&s;ies in our Age, where we have <HI>a more &s;ure Word of Pro|phe&s;y,</HI> which we are commanded to take heed to, and which the modern Agents of the <HI>Devil</HI> are only employ'd to counter-act, and drive out of the World, if po&s;&s;ible, that the old Oracles of Devil-wor&s;hip, and other Delu&s;ions, might be again in|troduc'd.</P>

<P>HAVING ob&s;erv'd how the <HI>Devil,</HI> in the In|fancy of his Corre&s;pondence with Mankind, came to him, and made his Acquaintance by the &s;ame Method that God was pleas'd to reveal him&s;elf on Occa&s;ions of the greate&s;t Importance; it would be very much to the Advantage of our pre&s;ent Enquiry, if we could come at &s;ome more Particulars in the re&s;pective Appearances, and know &s;omething of the Difference in them, that &s;o for the Future we might di&s;tingui&s;h our Modern In&s;pirations, and not oblige the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o much, or his Favourites either, as to flatter their Vanity with thinking they are di|vinely

<P>That God was pleas'd to reveal him&s;elf to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Servants of old by Vi&s;ion and Dream is eviden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be&s;ides the Examples mention'd before, from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own Declaration, that this was the way he re&s;olv'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to tran&s;act with them, Numb. xii.6. <HI>If there be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Prophet among you, I the</HI> LORD <HI>will make my &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> known to him in a Vi&s;ion, and will &s;peak unto him i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Dream.

<P>This is a noted Declaration of the Manner how God would di&s;cover him&s;elf to his Servants; and we cannot doubt but the <HI>Devil,</HI> who knew it very well, did quickly imitate the like Method, and bring in a thou&s;and Delu&s;ions at the &s;ame Door: It being in his Power, as I have &s;aid, to inject Midnight Thoughts and Amu&s;ements, and make his Appearances in Vi&s;ion and Dream as he pleas'd; how near he might come to imitate the Vi&s;ions and Revelations of God, is what I cannot under|take to determine: I am &s;ure 'tis more than pro|bable that he might do &s;o, in a manner as might deceive tho&s;e unguarded Per&s;ons, to whom he often thus appear'd, and who&s;e Ends in &s;eeking him out might be almo&s;t as wicked as his that appear'd to them.</P>
<P>It may be &s;omething too much in the Favour of the Pretenders to <HI>new Light and Prophe&s;ies,</HI> and to the ancient Revelations and Di&s;coveries made by fal&s;e Prophets, properly &s;o call'd in the holy &s;acred Writings; but I cannot an&s;wer it to my own Rea&s;on, if I &s;hould &s;ay, that I believe they all knew, and every time too when they &s;aid, <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> that it was fal&s;e, that they told a wilful preme|ditated Lye, and that they ought to have &s;aid, Thus &s;aith our &s;overeign Lord the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="142">Nor will I venture to &s;ay, that all the Modern Heathens, the <HI>Druids</HI> among the <HI>Britains,</HI> the Prie&s;ts of the Heathen Temples, who uttered the Oracles of the <HI>Devil,</HI> however they came by them, or the <HI>Bramans</HI> and &s;tricte&s;t Reclu&s;es of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> the <HI>Dervi&s;es</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the like, do all actually know, that is to &s;ay, by immediate Commu|nications from Hell, and the In&s;trumentality of its Agents, that they really are Confederate with the great Enemy of Mankind, and carrying on a Cor|re&s;pondence with the <HI>Devil.</HI> I have &s;o much Opi|nion of the Power of common Sen&s;e in Man, as a human Creature, and &s;o much Charity for the good Meaning of tho&s;e, who we do not find immediately vile, profligate, and immoral, as to think they would not act with <HI>Satan</HI> upon that foot.</P>
<P>I have much more Rea&s;on to think the four Ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticks of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> in the Story <HI>Jetzer,</HI> acted with Satan open-ey'd, and open-fac'd, when they propos'd to the poor fooli&s;h Creature to renounce God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o to carry on the Fraud they had begun, with a kind of Sanction in|&s;tead of an Oath of Secre&s;y, and it appear'd indeed to be &s;o at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But certainly, as in other Ca&s;es, abundant Para|lels might be brought. The <HI>Devil,</HI> who generally acts in Di&s;gu&s;e, has carry'd tho&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es &s;o art|fully, that I doubt not but many of his fal&s;e Pro|phets, long before our times, have &s;aid, <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> with a good Grace; <HI>that is,</HI> with a real Belief, that God had &s;poken to them, or, as was the Language of the Scripture Times, had &s;poken by them, when really it was the Voice of the <HI>De|vil,</HI> and of no body el&s;e: And let not our Modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ticks take this to be &s;aid only in Favour of them&s;elves; I am not come &s;o far down in the cour&s;e of my Work, &s;o much as to think of them, no not of St. <HI>Dun&s;tan,</HI> St. <HI>Francis,</HI> or of the more

eminent Deceiver St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> the greate&s;t Enthu|&s;ia&s;tick of the la&s;t ten Centuries: when I come to them, we &s;hall reckon as we meet.</P>
<P>But I am yet talking of the &s;pecifick Difference between the In&s;pirations of fal&s;e Prophets, the Dreams whi&s;per'd and &s;ugge&s;ted by the <HI>Devil</HI>; and tho&s;e on the other hand from the contrary Appear|ances of the good Spirit, that is to &s;ay, of God him&s;elf. I am in the fir&s;t place to intimate, that they are not always to be di&s;cern'd, no nor ea&s;y to be di&s;cern'd; if they were, there would not be &s;o many Delu&s;ions in the World as have been; for the Men are not all <HI>Devils</HI> before they come to him, they don't come to him re&s;olving to be deceiv'd, and intending to deceive every Body they are con|cern'd with. I mu&s;t own, I do not think that all the four hundred Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> whom <HI>Elijah</HI> &s;um|mon'd together to the great Sacrifice at Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> would have &s;hew'd &s;o many antick Tricks, leaping upon the Altar, cutting them&s;elves with Knives, and crying <HI>O Baal hear us!</HI> if they had believ'd they were under a Delu&s;ion of the <HI>Devil</HI> all the while, and that <HI>Baal</HI> was no Body but a dead Stock, a lifele&s;s Image, without Sen&s;e to hear, much more without Power to an&s;wer. They mu&s;t certainly believe, that <HI>Baal</HI> was a Something, or a Somebody, whom it was their Duty to pay a Ho|mage and Reverence to; or that they paid that Homage to the true God, through the Medium of an Image, a &s;ort of a Model of that meaner and more ignorant <HI>Idolatry</HI> call'd Popery.</P>
<P>But to look forward beyond this Image of Idol-wor&s;hip, we have the old fal&s;e Prophets coming much nearer to the true, and the In&s;pirations bear|ing an Affinity in a more &s;ignificant Point; and that is, in <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Wonders,</HI> or what we call Mircales, which yet may be all from the <HI>Devil</HI>; &s;o hard it is for the deceiv'd fal&s;e Prophet
<PB N="129" REF="144">
to know when he is right and when he is wrong; and &s;o ea&s;y is it for him to be impos'd upon him|&s;elf, and con&s;equently to delude the People he con|ver&s;es with.</P>

&s;tarted, but a Miracle was pre&s;ently enquir'd after to confirm it; and he that could do the mo&s;t eminent things of that kind, was the mo&s;t famous in their Opinion. <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> was a South&s;ayer, and &s;aid to be the Son of <HI>Apollo:</HI> He was in &s;uch Credit and E|&s;teem in his time, that it grew into a Proverb, to be <HI>as infallible as</HI> Mop&s;us.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> meeting one <HI>Chalchas,</HI> a Man like|wi&s;e eminent in the &s;ame devili&s;h Profe&s;&s;ion, they fell into Di&s;pute about &s;ome things relating to their ART. <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> ask'd <HI>Chalchas,</HI> how many Figs &s;uch a wild Fig-tree, as he pointed out to him, had upon it; the South&s;ayer <HI>Chalchas</HI> would not an&s;wer him, but alledg'd, that it was not a fair Que&s;tion. Upon which <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> told him the Number, and upon counting them up, it was found true to a Fig; upon which <HI>Chalchas</HI> was &s;o confounded, not being able to conceive how it was perform'd, that tho' the thing was trifling, he died for Grief.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, <HI>Chalchas</HI> had his Fortune told him by the Oracle, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he &s;hould dye when he found out a better South&s;ayer than him&s;elf; all which I can re&s;olve into nothing but this, that <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> had more Favour with the <HI>Devil</HI> than <HI>Chal|chas,</HI> at lea&s;t at that time, and that he whi&s;per'd the Number of the Figs in his Ear; or to clear up the Juggle, <HI>Mop&s;us</HI> had counted them before, and &s;o the Que&s;tion was a Juggle in it &s;elf; which in|deed was the mo&s;t likely of the two.</P>
<P>The Humour of the Times being, as I &s;aid, to require Miracles and Wonders, the South&s;ayers and Dreamers of Dreams be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, and &s;ought out (every Man his own Way) for &s;ecret In|&s;pirations and Illuminations, and the <HI>Devil</HI> was very u&s;eful to them on many Occa&s;ions, till at la&s;t he found the Work encreas'd upon his Hands, and he was oblig'd to &s;et up Delu&s;ion-Offices, as I may call them, and give out An&s;wers at the

Shrines of the People's Idols, and in the Names of their Gods.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;o far from crying down the Office or Dignity of a South&s;ayer in the World, that it rather encrea&s;t their Fame. For as the Number of tho&s;e Oracles were but few, not above twelve or fourteen, great and &s;mall; &s;o the <HI>wi&s;e Men,</HI> the <HI>Ma|gicians</HI> and <HI>South&s;ayers,</HI> were often &s;ent by their re|&s;pective Princes, who&s;e Favourites they were, to tho&s;e Oracles on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, and to be re&s;olved in their Doubts; whence they fre|quently brought &s;uch An&s;wers, as they knew would plea&s;e and oblige the Prince that &s;ent them; per|haps as be&s;t &s;uited the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Prin|ces, and which tho&s;e &s;o &s;ent be&s;t knew, whether the Oracle gave &s;uch An&s;wers or no, the latter being not always nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This working by Miracle &s;eldom or never fail'd; it confounded the Under&s;tandings of Men; and when any of their South&s;ayers had once obtain'd an E&s;teem by &s;uch a Performance, he never wanted any thing more to continue his Character, and to gain him Admittance into the Favour and Court of the greate&s;t Princes. Hence <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s telling <HI>Pha|raoh</HI>'s Chief Butler and Chief Baker their Dreams, and tho&s;e Dreams exactly coming to pa&s;s, open'd the Doors of the Pri&s;on for him; as his adding to it that of telling the Interpretation of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Dream advanc'd him to the &s;econd Chariot, and to the crying <HI>Abrek</HI> before him, that is <HI>Bow the Knee.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the Opinion of &s;ome Learned in the Wi&s;|dom of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> continued the Art of South&s;aying (for in that the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> chiefly con&s;i&s;ted) for a great while after; and I acknowledge my &s;elf to be of that O|pinion, whether I am learned in the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> or no, and that he had never been con|tinued in &s;uch a high Po&s;t &s;o long, if he had not.</P>

<P>And indeed, without putting any &s;train'd or con|&s;train'd Meaning upon the Sacred Text, I cannot doubt but that the People of <HI>Aegypt</HI> took <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to be what they call'd the Prince of the <HI>Magicians</HI> of the Ea&s;t; that is to &s;ay, one of the Chief of them, and extraordinarily qualify'd by the Gods for the Under&s;tanding deep My&s;teries, for diving into hard Que&s;tions, interpreting Dreams, and re&s;olving Doubts.

<P>Nor was it unrea&s;onable for the poor People un|der the dark Circum&s;tances of that Age to believe &s;o of him; for how el&s;e &s;hould he have the Fore|knowledge of the dreadful Famine &s;even Years be|fore it came? how that Sagacity to gather &s;uch im|men&s;e Quantities of Corn in the plentiful Years be|fore it; and lay it up in &s;uch Places, and in &s;uch Proportions, and &s;o &s;ecur'd, as to &s;upply &s;uitably the whole Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> &s;o va&s;tly extended, and &s;o populous as it was at that time?</P>
<P>How <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> came by all this Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, they (as we have like rea&s;on to believe) were as ignorant of, as they were po&s;itive that it was &s;o, by &s;ome means or other; and therefore it was no Ab&s;urdity for them to &s;ugge&s;t that he did all

by Divination, that is to &s;ay, by Enchantment, or &s;ecret Conver&s;e with the Spirits of another World; or as we call it, with more Propriety at lea&s;t in our Opinion, that he dealt with the <HI>Devil</HI>; and that this was done by the Charm of the Silver Cup which was put in the Mouth of <HI>Benjamin</HI>'s Sack.</P>
<P>That they believ'd &s;o is evident from the Words of the &s;ame Chap. <HI>Gen.</HI> xliv.5.

<P>That <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> knew better, and that he certainly neither u&s;ed &s;uch Methods, or convers'd with any &s;uch kind of Foreigners or Infernals, was mo&s;t cer|tain; but his Steward was directed to &s;peak in the Language of the Country; nor would he have talk'd to have been under&s;tood, if he had not: and this confirms the Conjecture as above, and makes it mo&s;t rea&s;onable; namely, that all <HI>Aegypt</HI> took him (<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>) to be a South&s;ayer or wi&s;e Man, and that certainly he could Divine.</P>
<P>This Part of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Story is u&s;eful to explain by what manner of Communication the Diviners of tho&s;e days u&s;ed to maintain their Acquaintance with the Infernals, and how mean and &s;candalous Methods the <HI>Devil</HI> contriv'd to &s;ettle his Corre|pondence; that in &s;hort, by the clanging of an old Kettle, or Bra&s;s-pot, the whole Hive of <HI>Devils</HI> &s;hould be alarm'd, be told that &s;ome of their Ma|&s;ters on Earth had occa&s;ion for them, or as we

call it, wanted to &s;peak with them, and that they &s;hould immediately fly to hand, and mount to the Place to know the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This will be a very material Point to di&s;cu&s;s more fully, and to explain the Philo&s;ophy of, if we &s;hould come to examine the mo&s;t accurate and polite Me|thods of that particular Art, which we call rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil,</HI> of which &s;o many valiant old Women have been compleatly Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and that &s;o emi|nently, that Satan dur&s;t no more refu&s;e to attend the Call, or fail of his Duty when he heard the Summons, than a School-boy that has been well la&s;h'd for playing Truant, dares do it again, before his Back-&s;ide has done &s;marting: For doubtle&s;s, the Scolding of an old Woman, and upon &s;uch a Di&s;appointment too, would be enough to terrifie the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, if he has any Sen&s;e of that out|rageous Animal, call'd an old Witch, upon his Mind.</P>
<P>But I leave that Part to a particular Di&s;&s;ertation upon the Species, when I &s;hall learnedly and po|litely examine, and, if practicable, determine for the good of Mankind, the two following Wehigty and Important Difficulties.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether upon an immergent and &s;udden Occa&s;ion, the Mu&s;ick al&s;o being the &s;ame, old Mo|ther <HI>Anthony</HI> of &mdash; in the County of &mdash; could not be as effectual with her Voice to hive a Swarm of Bees, as any Bra&s;s Kettle or Warming-pan in all the Village; and &s;o both frugally &s;ave her Neighbours from the ri&s;que of brui&s;ing their Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff; and the &s;aid Mother <HI>Anthony,</HI> in|&s;tead of being liable to the Ducking-&s;tool for a common Di&s;turber, become a u&s;eful Servant to her King and Country, and enjoy a Pen&s;ion for her good Offices.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether the &s;ame Mother <HI>Anthony,</HI> ac|cording to the Hypothe&s;is of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Cup of Divi|nation,
<PB N="136" REF="151">
might not be al&s;o made u&s;eful in her Ge|neration upon like extraordinary Occa&s;ions, to lay the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that too by the &s;ame Rules that others rai&s;e him; &s;ince the Bees in their greate&s;t Hur|ries and Tumults are quieted, as above, by the &s;ame Noi&s;e, which at another time would fret and di&s;|order them; the Philo&s;ophy of which is not yet under&s;tood, nor can the Rea&s;on of it be di&s;cover'd in all the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions or Tran&s;actors who have &s;o long &s;tudied it. From whence they &s;ay, the Tinkers beating their Pans when they publi&s;h their Occupations, or as we call it vul|garly in <HI>England, Cry their Trades,</HI> are extreamly unea&s;y to all the old Women above their ninth Climacteric, and un&s;ufferable to tho&s;e who are en|gaged in the Article of Circle-making, and Paw-wawing; in&s;omuch that if a Tinker &s;hould have &s;top'd in a Village and beat his Kettle above a certain li|mited time, at, or within hearing of the Town of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p&s;wich,</HI> in Mother <HI>Lackland</HI>'s time, &s;he would have been obliged to have rai&s;ed the <HI>Devil</HI> for her A&s;&s;i|&s;tance. But this I leave to Experiment.</P>
<P>As, I &s;ay, the&s;e two important Que&s;tions may take up a large Tract by them&s;elves, and as they mu&s;t needs be of va&s;t Con&s;equence to the Readers, I doubt not the Book&s;ellers, who are generally Publick-&s;pi|rited Gentlemen, will embrace the Opportunity of publi&s;hing &s;uch a valuable Piece for the Good of the Nation; &s;o I &s;hall adjourn it for the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Come we next in order, according to the Con|tents of this Chapter, to the particular Que&s;tion in what Shape the <HI>Devil</HI> appeared to the fir&s;t Magi|cians, or the Inchanters of the mo&s;t early Times; and the An&s;wer is, as far as we can yet learn, that he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot a&s;&s;ume any Shape or vi&s;ible Appearance at all: whether it was his Mode&s;ty or his Policy is a Que|&s;tion has been a little, tho' not fully di&s;cu&s;s'd, and
<PB N="137" REF="152">
tho&s;e that &s;peak mo&s;t favourably of Satan, think it was the fir&s;t; for in the early Times of his Inti|macy he might be loth perhaps to expo&s;e him&s;elf to his new Acquaintance; whereas afterwards, when he became really a familiar Spirit, in the litteral Sen&s;e of the Word, he made no Difficulty to conver&s;e with his Favourites more openly, &s;ee and be &s;een; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>But if this was not the Ca&s;e, it &s;eems to me, that at fir&s;t, and while being only a Night Vi&s;iter he communicated him&s;elf by Vi&s;ion and Dream only, there was no manner of Occa&s;ion for the Lo|cality of his Per&s;on, and for a real Appearance; nor, if his Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, was it material whe|ther he deliver'd it by his own Mouth, or by the Voice of any of his tru&s;ty and well-beloved Angels and Agents, who are certainly as capable to officiate in his Place as if he was there in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as much a Spirit as the <HI>Devil</HI> is, we have Rea&s;on to believe he is &s;o far from being Omnipre&s;ent, that he would not be able to di&s;patch a thou&s;andth Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s he has upon his hands, if he had not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> innumerable number of Deputy Repre&s;enta|tive <HI>Devils</HI> always at his hand, to execute his Com|mi&s;&s;ions, and make their Appearance for him, when and as often as the meane&s;t of the South&s;aying In|chanting Race calls him.</P>
<P>And for this Rea&s;on it might be, that <HI>Ali Albrahazen,</HI> as is &s;aid above, in the fir&s;t Intimacies betwixt him and the Favourite Spirit who &s;poke to him in Dream, had a Name given, by which he was to be called three times at every Round of the Palm-tree Circle; which when he had rehear&s;ed, the <HI>Devil,</HI> (that is to &s;ay, that particular Deputy <HI>Devil</HI> which was appointed to wait upon him) was always to attend and be ready. Whether that &s;aid parti|cular Spirit was bound to his due and daily Atten|dance for that one Occa&s;ion, Hi&s;tory has not yet
<PB N="138" REF="153">
determined: I have only to &s;ay, that if it was &s;o, Friend <HI>Ali</HI> mu&s;t be a Magician of &s;ome Quality, that had a whole <HI>Devil</HI> to attend him per&s;onally and &s;ingly, who was allowed to do no other Bu&s;ine&s;s, but ju&s;t wait to receive his Orders, and give back the In&s;tructions which <HI>Ali</HI> might &s;tand in need of, unle&s;s perhaps now and then he might go upon &s;ome other Errands, where the Occa&s;ion was extraordinary.</P>
<P>We are told, that in <HI>America,</HI> and in &s;ome Na|tions in <HI>Africa,</HI> the Magicians or Wizards and Pawaws found Ways and Means to conver&s;e with Satan Face to Face, as particular Occa&s;ions requir'd; and that from the Beginning of Time: for per|haps his Conver&s;ation in tho&s;e remote Countries might be as antient as it was any where, <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o that, he does appear in tho&s;e Coun|tries, and upon certain Times or Occa&s;ions, in hu|man Shape, &s;ometimes in one Po&s;ture, &s;ometimes in another, as Circum&s;tances may vary; as &s;ometimes he appears angry and frightful, &s;urrounded with Fire, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceded with Tempe&s;t, and the like terrify|ing Objects, to let the People know that he can hurt them; &s;ometimes in Smiles, and &s;weet &s;picey Perfumes, and preceded by Mu&s;ic and Melody in the Air, to let them know he is plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it was late in the World before we, in the&s;e Parts, knew any thing of it; and it might be &s;o al&s;o before he begun tho&s;e Practices there: they were too gro&s;s to go down with the fir&s;t Ages, when the Knowledge of God was not &s;o entirely obliterated from the Minds of Men as it was af|terwards; But Idolatry had prevailed to &s;uch a de|gree in <HI>America,</HI> that the <HI>Devil</HI> was perhaps the only God they had heard any thing of for &s;ome thou&s;ands of Years. But I return to my Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="154">Except in tho&s;e and &s;uch like remote and unac|quainted Parts of the World, we do not find much Evidence of the Magicians &s;eeing or conver&s;ing with evil Spirits, of whatever Kind or Quality, in the Shapes of Men or Women: Gods Angels indeed, who are in &s;acred Text called the <HI>Heaven|ly Ho&s;t,</HI> are and have been frequently allowed to make their Appearance, and have been &s;ent hither on immediate and &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s, as to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>Jacob,</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the Father of <HI>John</HI> the Bap|ti&s;t, to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to the Shepherds at the Birth, to our Saviour him&s;elf on divers Occa&s;ions, and to the Women at the Sepulcher, at the Re|&s;urrection, and at the A&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Perhaps this may be the Rea&s;on why the <HI>Devil</HI> has kept his di&s;tance; he remembers no doubt his former Rencounters with <HI>Uriel</HI> and with <HI>Gabriel,</HI> or other Angels, no matter who, mentioned by Name in Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> and how they drove him about from one Part of the Wa&s;te to another, out of Heaven, out of Paradi&s;e, and every where el&s;e, where they and he happen'd to meet; and doubt|le&s;s he does not much care to rencounter them.</P>
<P>What Shape or Figure he appeared in when he came to tempt his Maker and our Saviour, at that time him&s;elf in a State of Per&s;onality as Fle&s;h and Blood, as it is not expre&s;&s;ed, &s;o I will not pre|tend to make a Gue&s;s at it: 'Tis plain when he was at any time ca&s;t out of the poor di&s;temper'd People by our Saviour, or by his Di&s;ciples, tho' he came evidently out of the Demoniac or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, yet he did not come out vi&s;ibly and in Shape, but walking off like a detected Thief in the dark, and imperceptible, he always play'd out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Method I believe he took with all &s;orts of People in the World for &s;ome Ages, e&s;pe|cially at the Beginning of Time; and would all our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or profe&s;&s;ed Dealers with this cunning

<P>But now it &s;eems as if our modern Magicians acted upon another foot; that they do not go to the <HI>Devil,</HI> but the <HI>Devil</HI> comes to them; they do not go to him in the De&s;arts and Retreats of the Dark for Directions and In&s;tructions, but he acts with them in Concert, and there is a kind of mu|tual Cohabitation, they go on hand in hand, and are Fellow-Agents, both Principals and both Ac|ce&s;&s;aries, only with this u&s;ual difference on the <HI>De|vil</HI>'s &s;ide, <HI>viz.</HI> if they happen to do any capital Mi&s;chief, &s;o as to bring them to the Gallows, he always leaves the Hanging Part to them, there he, as we &s;ay, &s;lips his Neck out of the Collar, and is gone.</P>
<P>This &s;ubtle Agreement in Mi&s;chief between the Magician and the Spirit that acts with him, is not at all for the Advantage of Mankind; and the Magicians of the former Mould &s;eem to have been much the le&s;s hurtful kind, for they generally were known to be what they pretended, and were only made u&s;e of by People when they wanted 'em, and for what was requir'd of them; &s;o they had their Pay and Wages of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and you had done with them.</P>
<P>But here we conver&s;e with the Men, knowing nothing of what they are, and do not &s;ee the <HI>Devil</HI> that is within them; &s;o we deal with the <HI>Devil</HI> at &s;econd hand, as we may call it, that is, we talk to him in di&s;gui&s;e, make Bargains and Contracts with him, and that &s;ome of the wor&s;t kind, by the Agency of the&s;e Magicians, and &s;ee not the evil Spirit who is all the while both Di|rector and Principal in all the Affair. Thus far for

tho&s;e Magicians who really deal in &s;ecret with him, and this is that Magick which we call the <HI>Black Art,</HI> that is to &s;ay a &s;ecret undi&s;cover'd Con&s;piracy between Satan and tho&s;e Agents of his which apply to him for Direction, and then their acting again by tho&s;e Directions, to abu&s;e, impo&s;e upon, and deceive Mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of who were the fir&s;t Practicers of <HI>Magick,</HI> as a Diabolical Art, and how it was handed on to the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> where it was fir&s;t openly encouraged.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Writers upon this Subject before me &s;eem to have all been at a lo&s;s to &s;ix the O|riginal of <HI>Magick</HI> as an <HI>Art Diabolical,</HI> and they would fain have us believe it was in Practice in the Antediluvean World. This I have not denied, nor &s;hall I deny it &s;till; but granting the <HI>Devil</HI> to have a Conque&s;t upon the fir&s;t Woman, and by her Weakne&s;s and Treachery drawing her Husband in|to the &s;ame Snare, we may give up all their Race for as black as Hell could make them: And indeed the &s;acred Text de&s;cribes them in Terms as black as can well be expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi.12. God looked upon the Earth and behold <HI>it was corrupt,</HI> for <HI>all Fle&s;h had corrupted his way upon the Earth</HI>; and <HI>ver.</HI> 13. <HI>The Earth is filled with Violence</HI>; and <HI>ver.</HI> 5. &s;peaking of Man, <HI>the Imagination of the Thought of his Heart was only Evil continually</HI>; and <HI>the Wick|edne&s;s of Man was great upon the Earth:</HI> upon this Account, I &s;ay, I gave up all that Race in the Be|ginning of this Work; and be it &s;o, or be it only &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o, 'tis much the &s;ame, nor is it

<P>But my Que&s;tion has been all along, not what was done <HI>before</HI> but <HI>&s;ince</HI> the Deluge, and how did <HI>Satan</HI> introduce him&s;elf to the <HI>po&s;t-diluvean</HI> Ages, when and where, with whom, and in what man|ner did he make his fir&s;t Acquaintance and break|ing in upon Mankind for a &s;econd Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or Management of Art?</P>
<P>I mention'd <HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> &s;lain in Battle by <HI>Semirami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Prometheus</HI> and others, and very early they were; and I &s;tand by my Account of them, that they were the fir&s;t <HI>Magicians,</HI> as the Word or Term <HI>Magician</HI> imply'd a Man of Learning, of Wit, and more than common Under&s;tanding, &s;earching after Knowledge, &s;tudying the Rudiments and fir&s;t Pre|cepts and Principles of Philo&s;ophy. But we are now in Search after another &s;ort of People, who, tho' they were Searchers into Knowledge too, yet look'd into it in another manner, and for other Purpo&s;es, namely, who &s;earched deeper into things, and into deeper things, I mean &s;earching into HELL it &s;elf; who began fir&s;t to enter upon Diabolical Enquiries into the infernal My&s;teries and Arts of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and where tho&s;e begun it is not &s;o ea&s;y to find out.</P>
<P>Some Authors, as <HI>Serenus,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ianus</HI> from him, and the learned Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> from both, hand down this fabulous Original for our Speculation, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Ham</HI> or <HI>Cham</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah</HI> having practi&s;ed tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious and &s;acrilegious Arts (I take their own Words) before the Flood, and knowing that he could bring no Book or Memorial of that nature into the holy Ve&s;&s;el where his Life was to be &s;ecured by the goodne&s;s of his Maker, and wherein he was to remain with his righteous and godly Father, cau&s;ed the Rules and Precepts to
<PB N="143" REF="158">
be graved in Metal, and in hard Stone, which &s;hould receive no Impre&s;&s;ion from the Water.</P>
<P>But this is &s;uch an evident Fiction, and full of &s;o many Ab&s;urdities and Contradictions, as well as Fal&s;hoods, that 'tis not only unlikely it &s;hould, but impo&s;&s;ible it can be true.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Where were tho&s;e Plates left? If they were to be pre&s;erved in the Ark, 'tis certain <HI>Noah</HI> who had the Superintendency of the whole Build|ing, and of every thing that was brought into it, or to be admitted, would much le&s;s have admitted copper Plates to be brought in there, or Tables of Stone with &s;uch Abominations engraven on them, than he would have taken in written Books, if &s;uch had been then in u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Had <HI>Cham</HI> been &s;uch a Per&s;on, &s;o far engaged in a Corre&s;pondence with Hell, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e God, who for the Rea&s;ons taken from the Sins of the re&s;t of Mankind de&s;troyed the whole World, would never have &s;pared him, and &s;o by him laid the Foundation of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s &s;econd Kingdom, and of his debauching the World with Sorcery and Witchcraft: nor do we read that <HI>Cham</HI> or <HI>Ham</HI> was cur&s;ed by his Father on any &s;uch Account, but for Sins actually committed af|ter the Deluge, and after their coming out of the Ark; but to charge <HI>Ham</HI> with Sorcery and Diabo|lical Practices before the Flood, is a gro&s;s begging the Que&s;tion, and by no means to be admitted without good Evidence.</P>
<P>And again, the Writing and Graving upon hard Stones, Metal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> requires a Proof that there was any &s;uch thing as the Knowledge and U&s;e of Letters among Men before the Flood; which after the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiry is not yet a&s;certained, much le&s;s agreed upon by Men of Learning; the &s;ame having not been pre&s;erved to Mankind after the Deluge, which 'tis highly probable would have
<PB N="144" REF="159">
been, if &s;uch a thing had been in u&s;e, the Know|ledge having been both innocent and u&s;eful.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If &s;uch Writing or Engravement were made by <HI>Cham,</HI> or any one el&s;e, where were they laid, and how found again? when, by the uni|ver&s;al Convul&s;ions &s;uffer'd during the Flood, not the lea&s;t Ve&s;tiges, Ruins or Remains of Cities or Towns were to be &s;een upon the Surface of the Earth, but all was huddled together in the gene|ral Confu&s;ion of the Parts, and either buried and overwhelmed in the Body of the Earth, or driven down by the rapid Currents which followed at the going off of the Flood; and it &s;eems &s;trange that the&s;e Stones or Plates could be found, when every thing el&s;e was lo&s;t and overthrown; when the Surface being perfectly new, no one Part of the World could be known from another, much le&s;s any Place be known by the Situation which it had before.</P>
<P>There are many more Ab&s;urdities in the Ca&s;e as it is propo&s;ed; but I mu&s;t not dwell too long in a Place, that have &s;o long a Journey to go.</P>
<P><HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> is the next to whom they would a|&s;cribe the Magick Art; but I have proved him to be a very hone&s;t Man, and a wi&s;e Man, pro|perly &s;peaking, in my former Chapters, and that he was employed in a much better and hone&s;ter Study, &s;uch as in di&s;covering the Nature of Herbs and Plants, Metals and Minerals, precious Stones and Jewels; that he invented the Doctrines and fir&s;t Principles of natural and moral Philo&s;ophy; and many u&s;eful and beneficial Parts of Know|ledge for the Good of Mankind; the Power of Simpathies and Antipathies, and their various Work|ings and Objects; in all which I take <HI>Abraham</HI> al&s;o, who was &s;till before him, to have been e&s;pecially famous; and that 'tis probable <HI>Abraham</HI> was parti|cularly in&s;tructed by <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf, for 'tis evident
<PB N="145" REF="160">
that <HI>Abraham</HI> was upwards of fifty Years old when <HI>Noah</HI> died.</P>
<P>To come off of all this, there are others who make another <HI>Zoroa&s;ter,</HI> a real and Diabolical Magi|cian, who was not &s;lain by <HI>Semiramis,</HI> as that wi&s;e Prince <HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> was; but on the other hand, ha|ving been teaching his Di&s;ciples the Art of rai&s;ing and conver&s;ing with Spirits, was by one of them taken away out of his School, all his Scho|lars looking on; or, if you will have it in a modern Style, he rai&s;ed the <HI>Devil,</HI> to &s;hew his Di&s;ciples a Te&s;t of his Art; and the <HI>Devil</HI> carried him away in the face of them all, to give them a Te&s;t of his Power: which (by the way) was but poor Encou|ragement at that time, for any one of them to turn Magician; and for that Rea&s;on, and knowing the <HI>Devil</HI> to be no Fool, makes me give the le&s;s heed to that Part of the Story.</P>
<P>Other Writers, of whom <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is one, (who&s;e Credit, I mu&s;t always premi&s;e, goes but a very lit|tle way with me) tells us, that <HI>Seth</HI> the Son of <HI>Adam</HI> fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the Planets or wandering Stars with their Motions, Influences, Revolutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that tho&s;e with &s;everal other u&s;eful Branches of A&s;tronomic Knowledge were handed down by Tra|dition to <HI>Noah,</HI> and by him to the new World, and that then coming from <HI>Noah</HI> immediately to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>Zoroa&s;ter</HI> and others, they were hand|ed from them to Po&s;terity, as we find it at this Day.</P>
<P>But all this is nothing to the purpo&s;e, that is to &s;ay, nothing to our Diabolick Magick, nor does it give any Light into the grand Que&s;tion, Who was the fir&s;t Author of that kind of Study; who was <HI>Satan</HI>'s fir&s;t Corre&s;pondent in the new World, or fir&s;t dealt with the <HI>Devil</HI> after the Flood? I cannot think indeed that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;uffered Man|kind to live long unmole&s;ted by him, or that Man|kind
<PB N="146" REF="161">
could go on long without &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s be|tween them: they would be both eager to renew the Acquaintance, and re&s;tore the ancient Familia|rity; and it could not be long before they found &s;ome means or other to bring it to pa&s;s; for Lovers you know will meet, whatever are the Difficulties which fir&s;t ob&s;truct: and e&s;pecially the great Arti&s;t on his Side had many dark De&s;igns in view, and new Foundations to lay for the Overthrow of a ri&s;ing Generation, which required to be laid deep and &s;trong, and the &s;ooner they were begun, the better for him.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Cham</HI> being the Author of Magick in the new World, that indeed I cannot grant, that is to &s;ay, not as the Ancients bring in the Story; namely, that he invented the Seven liberal Sciences, and wrote them in fourteen Pillars of Bra&s;s or Stone, <HI>&amp;c</HI> as above; that <HI>Cham,</HI> as he was, notwith&s;tand|ing the Cur&s;e he incurred by his ill Behaviour to his Father, one of the immediate Progenitors of the new Race, and particularly of tho&s;e great and mighty Nations the <HI>Aegyptians, Arabians, Africans,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> among whom all human Wi&s;dom and Learning fir&s;t flouri&s;hed, and indeed fir&s;t be|gan; &s;o I doubt not but he was capable to in&s;truct them in much of the antediluvean Knowledge, and that of even the be&s;t things, and did &s;o: That he reigned afterward in <HI>Aegypt</HI> a very long while, is confirmed by all the antient Writers; particularly in the Catalogue of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kings, of which <HI>Cham</HI> was certainly the fir&s;t, they are &s;aid to reign and &s;ucceed one another thus,<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Cham</HI> peopled <HI>Egypt</HI> the Year of the World 1847, 191 Years after the Flood.

and Monuments only, but for Magick, that is, A&s;tronomick Ob&s;ervations, as <HI>Semiramis</HI> did the great Tower of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it appears that <HI>Cham</HI> came to <HI>Aegypt</HI> when he was near three hundred Years old; &s;up|po&s;e him to be an hundred Years old when he came out of the Ark, which was the mo&s;t, for his elder Brother <HI>Sem</HI> was no more, and that he reign'd in <HI>Aegypt</HI> one hundred and &s;ixty one Years, in which time he made the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and the <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> for they were all his Offspring, very polite Nations.</P>

<P>So that in &s;hort, <HI>Cham</HI> was &s;o exceeding fruitful, that he peopled all <HI>Africa,</HI> and &s;ince that, from <HI>Africa</HI> all <HI>America,</HI> and tho&s;e particularly populous Parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> called <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>I expect my light-headed Readers, who&s;e Wits are too volatile for this remote Story, will call this a dry Subject, tho' to me I confe&s;s 'tis ju&s;t the contrary; but as it is too grave for them, I will endeavour it &s;hall not be too long for them; &s;o to oblige Folly, and I am &s;ure to the Di&s;like of the truly wi&s;e and &s;olid Heads, I leave off before I have done, that I may not abate that mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Cu&s;tom of writing mo&s;t of that which is plea&s;ant, and lea&s;t of that which is profitable; &s;o willing is your humble Servant to be a Man of Mode, and &s;uch a Weight does he put on tho&s;e who have real|ly no Weight in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In favour then of the U&s;age of the Times, and e&s;pecially of the Genius and Temper I mention
<PB N="148" REF="163">
above, I am to leave off tho&s;e grave tho' u&s;eful Di|gre&s;&s;ions, and come back to the Progre&s;s of Ma|gick, the particular Subject before me.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Devil</HI> was the Aggre&s;&s;or in his new Corre&s;pondence with Mankind is not to be doubted, but that is not &s;o much our Bu&s;ine&s;s; as to know when this Corre&s;pondence began, who was the fir&s;t among Men that carried on the clande&s;tine Deal|ing, and how it was managed on both Sides.</P>
<P>We have cleared <HI>Cham</HI> of the Charge, as far as Probabilities will go in his Favour; and the Truth is, <HI>Cham</HI> grew quickly too great, was above the Occa&s;ion for it, and being the fir&s;t, and perhaps the greate&s;t Monarch upon Earth, even before <HI>Ninus</HI> or <HI>Bell</HI> (<HI>Baal</HI>) he had no need of turning Conjurer and Magician, which became pre&s;ently the Work of a meaner Race of Men than <HI>Cham</HI>; for the Magicians, e&s;pecially &s;peaking of them now as Witches and Inchanters, were not Kings and Emperors, but the Servants of Kings and Empe|rors; kept and maintained for the wicked Works and Services which they did for them.</P>
<P>Indeed the Magicians which I mentioned at fir&s;t, were Wor&s;hippers of the divine Being, or eminent Examples of the Homage Men owed to the true God; nay, and even after &s;ome time were Teachers of divine things too, tho' under the mi&s;taken <HI>Mediums</HI> of Idols and Images; The&s;e <HI>Magi,</HI> or Magicians, as I have ob&s;erved, were at fir&s;t &s;o reverenced and honoured by the Nations they &s;erved, as often to be made Go|vernours of the Common-wealth; Publick Be|nefactors having the mo&s;t Right to the publick Honours and Advancements in tho&s;e Countries where they had been accepted for their Merits.</P>
<P>Hence it &s;eems mo&s;t natural, that all Kings &s;hould be Patriots, &s;eeing the very Name and Dig|nity, much more the Office, began in the Thing;
<PB N="149" REF="164">
but that by the way; how far the <HI>Patriot</HI> and the <HI>Royalty</HI> go together in the&s;e Days, how the Name and the Dignity corre&s;pond, let the Kings of the Earth examine, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to mend it where it is not &s;o, and to let it be more known where it is.</P>
<P>It is then pretty hard to find out who were the fir&s;t Magicians, taking the Word Magick as I now under&s;tand it, <HI>viz.</HI> in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e; and yet it does not &s;eem to be very long after the Flood be|fore we &s;hall find &s;ome of them at work; for in the immediate Reign after <HI>Cham,</HI> that is, in the Reign of <HI>Mizraim</HI> or <HI>O&s;yris,</HI> which Hi&s;tory makes to be the <HI>Pharaoh</HI> who&s;e Dream <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> interpreted, and who reigned two hundred &s;ixty one Years; in his Reign 'tis evident there were &s;uch People. See the Place, <HI>Gen.</HI> xli.8. <HI>He &s;ent and called for all the Ma|gicians of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>and all the wi&s;e Men thereof.</HI></P>
<P>It is true it does not appear po&s;itively that the&s;e were Magicians of the wor&s;t Sort, but it &s;eems to be &s;o, becau&s;e Heaven re&s;erved from them the re|vealing to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> the Interpretation of his Dreams; which however might be to pre&s;erve the Honour to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and to make way for all the great Events which followed; but &s;till, I &s;ay, we do not know that here were none of the pre&s;ent kind of wicked Magicians, and we have much rea&s;on to believe there were.</P>
<P>But within the Space of about two hundred Years after, we are &s;ure to find them; nay, the Text is plain, they were there when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> &s;tood before the la&s;t <HI>Pharaoh</HI> who held the People in Captivity; for then they imitated the Miracles of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> by their Inchantments, that is, by <HI>Sorcery</HI> and <HI>Witchcraft</HI>; now even this was but a little above eight hundred Years from the Flood; and thus much may &s;uffice for the Chronology of of Witchcraft and Sorcery.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="165">Being thus come to a tolerable Certainty as to Time, when this Art was fir&s;t practi&s;ed, we &s;hall be led more directly to the Per&s;ons, by entring a little into an Enquiry after the Practice, that is, the Manner made u&s;e of in tho&s;e early Times of the Art; for by di&s;covering what they did, we &s;hall di&s;|cover al&s;o who did it: They acted certainly from the Beginning, by certain My&s;tick or concealed Conjurations, &s;uch as uncouth Noi&s;es and Sounds, &s;trange Ge&s;tures, Po&s;tures, and barbarous Magick Noi&s;es, of which we &s;hall &s;ay more in their Place.</P>
<P>But what, &s;ay our Enquirers, were tho&s;e things called Inchantments, which con&s;titute what is called the <HI>Black Art,</HI> or the <HI>Craft Magical?</HI> The Text &s;ays the Magicians did &s;o and &s;o, by their <HI>Inchant|ments</HI>; that is, whatever Wonders or Miracles the two Prophets of God wrought by the Finger and Power of God, the&s;e Men imitated by the Power of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Inchantments I take to con&s;i&s;t of certain agreed Ge&s;tures and Noi&s;es, certain barbarous Names and Words, and &s;uch inexplicable Terms of helli&s;h Art, which upon Concert between Hell and the helli&s;h Agent, are to be &s;o and &s;o under&s;tood between them; on expre&s;&s;ing of which, and mak|ing &s;uch Circles and Figures on the Ground as is agreed, the evil Spirit with whom they have con|certed the Affair beforehand, &s;hall appear, and ap|pear too in &s;uch and &s;uch Form as they appoint to bring him out in; and this I give as a brief Defini|tion of what they call Inchantment.</P>
<P>And here, not to preach upon the Point, or to in&s;i&s;t that even what is thus acted mu&s;t be by the Power of Heaven concurring, for this is what all that are not Athei&s;ts acknowledge; but, I &s;ay, not to dwell on this Part, I make &s;o free with our Fellow-Conjurers as to &s;ay, they put a great deal of Cheat upon the World, in pretending to act by
<PB N="151" REF="166">
&s;upernatural Powers in tho&s;e Inchantments, let them be of what &s;ort they will, whereas they really acted much by Cheat and Trick, Lege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">demain or Slight of Hand, and pretended the Prince of the Air, when he had nothing to do in it; that how|ever &s;ome of tho&s;e things were certainly by his, the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it was with <HI>Ali Albrahazen,</HI> and has been with others to this Day, which we &s;hall not and cannot deny, yet 'ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appa|rent much of it has been, as I &s;aid, meer juggling and deceiving.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Devil</HI> has not tied him&s;elf up to Methods in his acting with Mankind, &s;o neither hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Magicians of the World kept to any certain Me|thods, as to a &s;tated Rule in their Actings among us, but have, on many Occa&s;ions, made u&s;e of dif|fering Methods; I mean as to their Management between the <HI>Devil</HI> and them; and al&s;o as to their apparent putting the Belief of it upon us.</P>
<P>How we &s;hall do to know and di&s;tingui&s;h when the Magician puts the <HI>Devil</HI> upon us, and when he only acts the Juggler, would be worth while to find out; and did either the <HI>Devil</HI> or the Magician act by any &s;tated Rules and Methods, we might make &s;ome Judgment about it; but on the other hand, they are &s;o much and &s;o often both <HI>Devils</HI> and both Jugglers, that 'tis very difficult to fix them.</P>
<P>For Example, in their coming to Audience, ob|taining Admittance, or call it what you will, the great Que&s;tion is, How do they let the <HI>Devil</HI> know they want to &s;peak with him? either he is always at their Elbow, and can hear them whenever they call, where-ever they are, and on whatever Occa|&s;ion; and that would be to a&s;cribe either great things to him, as a Per&s;on, or a great Number to him, as an Ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, 'tis certain the&s;e People have certain concerted Terms agreed, as I &s;aid above, up|on repeating which he is to appear to them, and

act for them as they &s;hall agree, and tho&s;e I call Inchantments. There are al&s;o other agreed Signals, upon making which, the <HI>Devil,</HI> according to the Terms agreed on between them, &s;hall act in &s;uch and &s;uch a manner without appearing; and tho&s;e I call Charms.</P>
<P>Thus, it &s;eems, the <HI>Devil</HI> and Dr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reman</HI> agreed the Matter; the good Doctor having a mind to pay home an old Je&s;t upon a young Gentleman that had abu&s;ed a poor Girl, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lient of his; the Doctor, it &s;eems, told her, that if &s;he could per&s;wade him to get into her Smock upon their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Intimacy, he would certainly agree to marry her; upon which the poor Girl makes her&s;elf a new one, and very large for the Purpo&s;e, and getting the young Fel|low into it, the Doctor, as was &s;aid, laid &s;uch a Charm upon it, or the <HI>Devil</HI> by his Order, that the Fellow could never get out of it till he gave the Girl a Note under his Hand to marry her the next Morning, and accordingly did it.</P>
<P>If the Story be Fact, as is loudly affirm'd, the <HI>Devil</HI> acted upon the hone&s;t &s;ide it &s;eems; which I do not however charge upon him as a thing that he is often guilty of; but now and then, for the Credit of his Employers, he may be allowed to go out of his Way a little.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e things called Charms are, and how made u&s;e of, may occa&s;ion &s;ome Speculation as we go on, and when we come to &s;peak of Charms as they are u&s;ed between the <HI>Magicians</HI> and the Peo|ple; but I am now upon the Subject of Charms and Inchantments, as they relate to the proper In|tercour&s;e between the Magician and the <HI>Devil,</HI> or the Spirit whom he acts with, or by or for whom he acts, for 'tis not ea&s;y to expre&s;s it right.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, 'tis not ea&s;y to &s;ay in what Capacity the Ma|gician is to be under&s;tood to act. 1. Whether WITH (that is) in Concert and Agreement, or, 2. as we might &s;ay, in Partner&s;hip with the <HI>Devil</HI>; or whe|ther

in a &s;uperior Orb, as a Magician of Quality, making u&s;e of an attendant, ob&s;equious, commanded <HI>Devil,</HI> always at his call, to do what he bids him, jump over his Stick, run and go, fetch and carry like a Dog, as &s;ome eminent Magicians of State have been &s;aid to act; or as St. <HI>Dun&s;tan,</HI> St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the Abbot of <HI>Crowland,</HI> and others did by him, who they tell us &s;et him to work, &s;ent him of Errands, made him ring the Bell to Ve&s;pers, &s;weep the Church, and a thou&s;and good things the &s;er|viceable <HI>Devil</HI> did for them, if his good Hu|mour is not bely'd by the Prie&s;ts knavery, and Satan charg'd with more Complai&s;ance for 'em, than ever he was guilty of: Or, 3.

<P>But be it which of the&s;e it will, there mu&s;t be &s;ome concerted Terms of <HI>come</HI> and <HI>call</HI> between the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Corre&s;pondents; like Ships at Sea, they mu&s;t conver&s;e by Signals, they mu&s;t know when to meet, and when to &s;ummons for a meeting; when to appear, and when to di&s;appear; and to do this, is one of the con&s;tituting Parts of Magick; for without it the Magician is as good as no body, and the Devil in &s;hort would appear of no u&s;e to him.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Parts of <HI>India</HI> they alledge to this Day, that he is talk'd with in the apparent Shape of a Man, and in the Habit of their Prie&s;ts; but that is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s; they add that whenever they want to &s;peak with him, they go up to &s;uch and &s;uch Mountains in Troops or A&s;&s;emblies; &s;uch as ours at <HI>New-Hall</HI> perhaps, only with &s;ome &s;pecifick Differences, which I might mention but that they are too

<P>It is hard to find out in Hi&s;tory, what Words tho&s;e were, that were us'd for Charms in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> between the <HI>Devil</HI> and the Magicians for &s;o many Ages; it is certain they differ'd in dif|fering Countries, and 'tis as certain they differ'd as the &s;everal Per&s;ons acted together or apart; but I am as much at a lo&s;s to find out what the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould mean by &s;uffering tho&s;e Words, or any Words at all, to charm, call, awaken or alarm him, as I am to know what the Words were; but at pre&s;ent let us think of the Words.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> have left us a Word, which was us'd by the <HI>Magicians</HI> of Antiquity among them, upon the&s;e and many more &s;uch Occa&s;ions. This is that famous Trine, or Triangular Word call'd <HI>Abraca|dabra,</HI> which drawn out in its Equilateral Sides &s;tands thus.

<P>They &s;ay on the contrary, that it was invented by one <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> a learned <HI>Greek,</HI> that it con|tain'd the great and awful Name of the Divinity, and that it was u&s;ed for many Years for the oppo&s;ing the Spells and Charms of the Pagans; that is, the Diabolical Spells and Charms of the Pagan <HI>Magi|cians.</HI></P>
<P>But be this as it will, it fell into Contempt in after-Ages, and was u&s;ed by the <HI>Magicians</HI> them|&s;elves; &s;o that its containing, or being intended to contain the Name of <HI>God,</HI> &s;eems to me to be a Pretence only, to add a kind of Veneration to the Word; whereas it it now drop'd, only that &s;ome of our old Women, and quack <HI>Magicians,</HI> u&s;e it for a Spell or Charm, as they would have it call'd, to cure Agues, being written on a piece of Parch|ment, and hang'd about the Neck of the afflicted Per&s;on.</P>

<P>This &s;hews a little, what I am bringing all the&s;e things to; namely, that this was the Remains of the old Pagan Magick, and is all deriv'd from it, tho' perhaps it is practis'd with le&s;s crimi|nal Corre&s;pondence than it was then, the People that now do the&s;e things not knowing what they &s;ay, or to whom they &s;ay it, yet certainly the thing is the &s;ame.</P>

<P><HI>N.B.</HI> There is no room to que&s;tion, but that in <HI>Arabia, Aegypt, Syria,</HI> and tho&s;e Countries, where &s;o much Magick was at fir&s;t practis'd, and where the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Corre&s;pondence with Mankind was begun, where Magick was in its Perfection for &s;o many Ages, and practis'd with &s;uch apparent Succe&s;s, there are a great many &s;trange Stories current to this Day, and the Mouths of the People are &s;till fill'd with Traditional Accounts of the Wonders of the Ancients; their &s;trange Perfomances, and the Effects of their Magical Skill; the People are full of them, and even our <HI>Europeans,</HI> when they travel into tho&s;e Countries, bring away innu|merable Tales of this kind, which lo&s;e little in the coming, as perhaps this among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Account I am now going to give, relates to a <HI>Magician</HI> of great Note it &s;eems, tho', as I have &s;aid, I have not his Name, whom the <HI>Devil,</HI> if it was the <HI>Devil,</HI> managed much in the &s;ame way as the other, and 'tis of like u&s;e in the Ca&s;e before us. For as it confirms the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Conduct to be much the &s;ame with Mankind, tho' in different Places, &s;o it &s;hews us that the &s;ame occa&s;ions &s;uit him to make u&s;e of: Before, he frighted the <HI>Sabeans</HI> with a Meteor or Ball of Fire in the Air; Now he alarms <HI>Aegypt</HI> with a Comet; either of them things of no Signification in them&s;elves, and which we in tho&s;e days can look on without running to Conjurers for their Interpretation: But in tho&s;e younger

days they were &s;urpri&s;ing and terrifying, and there|fore very proper to amu&s;e the World with, and to make even Kings, as well as People, &s;end for their <HI>Magicians,</HI> to enquire after the Events of them.</P>
<P>In like manner we find in both the&s;e Accounts, the <HI>Devil</HI> not only making u&s;e of Dreams for di|&s;turbing the Fancies of the People, as well their Kings as others; but we find him in both u&s;ing that Power peculiar to him as a Spirit, namely, of cau&s;ing People to Dream of this, or that, (whatever he plea&s;es) on purpo&s;e to furni&s;h a Counterfeit In|terpretation to his Favourite South&s;ayer, and rai&s;e his Reputation at Court, in order to &s;erve his (<HI>Satan</HI>'s) Intere&s;t in other &s;ub&s;equent Delu&s;ions: But I refer to the Story.</P>
<P>An <HI>Arabian</HI> of Ancient Fame, and Eminent in the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Court for his great Skill in South-&s;ay|ing, having long &s;tudied the Knowledge of hidden and &s;ecret things, and arriv'd to great Skill in the Motions and Revolutions of the Stars and Planets, had made him&s;elf famous on that Account: Having al&s;o much &s;tudied the Appearances and Nature of the Planets, Vapours, Meteors, and other the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the upper Regions, from whence he made great and accurate Improvements in Natural and Experimental Philo&s;ophy; he al&s;o &s;tudied and under&s;tood the nature of Plants, Flowers, Drugs, Gums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Influences of the Hea|venly Bodies upon them, giving them Virtue, Co|lour, Aromatick Flavour, and mo&s;t healing and comforting Powers; and by this Knowledge, our Learned <HI>Arabian</HI> obtain'd the Fame of a mo&s;t excel|lent Phy&s;ician, as well as of a wi&s;e Man, and South&s;ayer, and was had in univer&s;al E&s;teem, but e&s;pecially I &s;ay in the Court of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Aegypt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="174"><HI>N.B.</HI> They do not tell us which <HI>Pharaoh</HI> this was, &s;o that the Chronology of this <HI>Ara|bian</HI> is &s;omething defective in that Part; but neither is this very material, becau&s;e much of it will be di&s;cover'd by the other Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Unwearied in his Diligence and Studies, and eaten up with the De&s;ire of Knowledge, this <HI>Arabian</HI> Doctor (for &s;uch we &s;hall now call him) not at all abating his Search after Wi&s;dom by the Fame al|ready obtain'd; but &s;eeing daily that there was an Aby&s;s of Knowledge yet behind, and that all he knew was as nothing, compar'd to what he was &s;till ignorant of, he pur&s;ued his Search into Nature with the utmo&s;t Application: All Night, yea many Nights together, he continued upon the Hills, and in the De&s;arts, whither he wandered; for <HI>Aegypt</HI> is a plain Country for many Leagues together, from <HI>Memphis</HI> where he re&s;ided. I &s;ay, all Night he &s;pent in looking up into Heaven, and all Day in poring upon the Earth, &s;earching into the Secrets of Na|ture, and trying and proving the Virtues of the Plants and Fruits, and other Rarities, the Product of that rich and fertile Soil: And thus he wa&s;ted and exhau&s;ted his vital and animal Strength, to feed and nouri&s;h the Strength of his Mind, and fill his Head and Heart with Divine Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding. Thus far it mu&s;t be acknowleg'd he was a true Original Magician, and a Man of Merit as well as Fame.</P>
<P>It happened in his wandering through the De|&s;art, to the Station where he u&s;ually fix'd his Place of A&s;tronomick Ob&s;ervations, that he &s;aw ri&s;e up out of the Sea, Northward from his Situation, a Body of Fire, which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to him one plain Flame, making an oblong Square, of an im|men&s;e Length and Breadth. But as it a&s;cended with the ordinary Motion of the Heavens, <HI>or rather ac|cording</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="175">
<HI>to the new Sy&s;tems,</HI> the ordinary Motion of the Earth, it le&s;&s;en'd in its apparent Dimen&s;ions, and al&s;o came to bear a more regular Form than be|fore; till coming to its full Height it appear'd af|ter &s;ome time to be a <HI>Comet</HI> or <HI>Blazing-&s;tar,</HI> which was vi&s;ible above the Horizon, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Bodies, for about twenty &s;ix Days (or Nights rather) &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and then was &s;een no more.</P>
<P>This Appearance being entirely new, &s;urmount|ed all the powers of his Under&s;tanding, and extreme|ly perplex'd him; and being one Night more than ordinarily afflicted about it, he broke out into Words to this purpo&s;e, tho' not directed to any of the Gods, not knowing it &s;eems which of them were able to inform him, and which not. <HI>O! that &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ed Inhabitants of the</HI> UNSEEN WORLD <HI>would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;earching out the My&s;tery of this &s;trange Phaenomenon.</HI></P>
<P>He was the more anxious about it, becau&s;e, at his return to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Memphis,</HI> he had an Account, that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had &s;ummon'd all the Ma|gicians and wi&s;e Men of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to give him their &s;everal Opinions of the meaning of this &s;trange Ap|pearance; for the King had either &s;een it, or heard of it from others. The Appearance of it, as I have &s;aid, being con&s;tant for about twenty &s;ix days after the <HI>Arabian</HI> had fir&s;t di&s;cover'd it; and the wi&s;e Men differing very much in their Accounts of it, their Judgment had encreas'd the King's Curio&s;ity very much; be&s;ides, the <HI>Arabian</HI> South|&s;ayer had notice given him, that he would receive a Summons or Order to come to the King's Palace upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Being thus, as is &s;aid, extremely puzzled with this Affair, and believing perhaps that he &s;hould do no more when he came to the King, than di&s;|cover his Ignorance, as the re&s;t of the South&s;ayers and the Magicians had done, he was very unea&s;y,
<PB N="161" REF="176">
and re&s;olv'd to retire into <HI>Aethiopia</HI> for &s;ome time, till the Enquiry might be over; and as he was not &s;ent for to the King, when the re&s;t of the Magici|cians were, it would be no Impeachment of his Fame, that he was gone abroad for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>One Day, while this publick Unea&s;ine&s;s la&s;ted, as he was walking towards his u&s;ual Ob&s;ervatory as above, there joyn'd him a grave and venerable old Man, who &s;aluting him with the u&s;ual Ble&s;&s;ing of the Times, and in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue, falls into Di&s;|cour&s;e with him upon divers Subjects, &s;uch as &s;eem'd to &s;hew that the <HI>Stranger</HI> was, like him&s;elf, an En|quirer after Knowledge. Among the re&s;t of their Di&s;cour&s;e, the <HI>Arabian</HI> particularly gave the Stran|ger an Account of the late Appearance which he had &s;een, as above.</P>
<P>They walk'd together till they came to the Foot of a gently ri&s;ing Mount, on the Top of which the <HI>Arabian</HI> had erected for him&s;elf a little Hut, or Bower of Palm-tree Leaves; here the Stranger &s;eeing him ready to go up to the Hill, offer'd to take his Leave, but he entreated him to go up to his Ob&s;ervatory (as he call'd it) with him, and to &s;tay with him that Night, that he might &s;hew him the &s;aid Appearance, and that in the Morning he &s;hould go whither he pleas'd.</P>
<P>When they were come up to the A&s;cent of the Hill, the Day being &s;hut in, and the time for Ob|&s;ervation of the Stars come on, the Heavens being clear, and the Moon ab&s;ent under the Horizon, leaving them a fair View of the Stars, perfectly bright and clear; the Stranger ask'd him, in what part of the Hemi&s;phere he had &s;een the Comet ri&s;e and &s;et, and what was the particular Sphere of its Motion; all which he &s;hew'd him mo&s;t exactly, and at la&s;t the Comet it &s;elf, not forgetting at the &s;ame time to let the Stranger know, how anxious and concern'd he had been to under&s;tand the Na|ture
<PB N="162" REF="177">
and Rea&s;on, as well as the Import of the Ap|pearance of &s;uch a Body, and to what particular Na|tion it had a Reference; and at la&s;t told him, how vehemently he had call'd out to the Gods, to give him &s;ome wi&s;e Interpreter, to in&s;truct him in the Nature of &s;uch Appearances, and of that in parti|cular.</P>
<P>The Stranger took no notice of his knowing that he had done &s;o, but began with a Philo&s;ophical Di&s;cour&s;e of Comets; as of Stars, which, in their ordinary Revolutions, are but &s;eldom vi&s;ible; and therefore when they do appear, &s;ays he, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that they import great Changes and Trou|bles among Men, which, &s;ays he, may in one Sen&s;e be true, becau&s;e they frequently are very much the occa&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the <HI>Arabian,</HI> how &s;hall we know when they have Important Significations, and when not, and to what Nations and Countries their Significa|tions are directed, and which are not concern'd in them?</P>
<P>Says the Stranger, There are Methods to know the&s;e things al&s;o; and the Gods, when they are minded to communicate the&s;e things, do it their own way. But <HI>Father,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Arabian,</HI> if you can relieve my Thought in the Signification of the pre&s;ent Difficulty, pray be &s;o kind; for I acknow|ledge my Ignorance, and that which perplexes me the more about it, is, that I expect to be call'd be|fore <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to-morrow, whom I reverence in the highe&s;t manner. I be&s;eech you inform me what I am to call this &s;trange new Appearance, and what are its Con&s;equences to the World.</P>
<P>Here the Stranger looking upon him with a &s;miling A&s;pect, reply'd; I have great Regard for your be|ing e&s;teem'd by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and &s;hall let you into the Knowledge of what you de&s;ire, for your farther good Fortune. Know then, added he, with an

<P>It was in vain that the <HI>Arabian</HI> Doctor ran out of the Hut or Bower, and down the Hill after him, to his two Servants, who always attended him at the Foot of the Hill, enquiring of them if the Father, the venerable Stranger, came not to them; they con&s;tantly and faithfully affirm'd that they had watch'd, as was their Duty, again&s;t wild Bea&s;ts for his Security, and that nothing had pa&s;&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>It was in vain al&s;o, that he went back lamenting, and calling aloud upon the Stranger, whom he &s;tyl'd <HI>Father,</HI> to return. <HI>How is it,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that you could thus far illuminate my Under&s;tanding, and reveal the &s;ecret of Wi&s;dom</HI> but in part; <HI>promi&s;ing to me a clear and perfect Knowledge,</HI> and then leave me <HI>unin&s;tructed, and in the dark, in the main and grand Inquiry?</HI> But no Voice, no Appearance return'd, which afflicted him &s;ore; and the Day appearing, he re&s;olv'd to con|tinue there the next Night, in hopes he might &s;ee him again in the Evening, as he had done before. After re&s;olving on this, and having been waking (as is &s;aid) all Night, he laid him down to &s;leep. He was no &s;ooner fallen into a deep Sleep, but he dream'd that he &s;aw, (or, to &s;peak it in the Language of the Ea&s;t,) the ancient Father, the venerable Stranger, appear'd to him again in a <HI>Dream.</HI></P>
<P>He was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpriz'd with the Sight of him, and according to the Ea&s;tern Cu&s;tom fell at his Feet, embracing his Knees, and with all the

<P>The Vi&s;ion on the contrary &s;eem'd di&s;pleas'd, and look'd at him with a le&s;s &s;miling and plea&s;ant Countenance than he had done before, when he was awake; and with a &s;tern Voice ask'd him wherefore he call'd after him &s;o importunately, when he had &s;taid &s;o long with him, and had &s;o fully inform'd him of all things he could de&s;ire.</P>

<P>The Doctor awaking, and the Vi&s;ion being end|ed, he now began to under&s;tand who it was he had been conver&s;ing with, namely an Angel of the invi&s;ible World, (I &s;uppo&s;e the Word <HI>Devil</HI> was not known among them at that time,) and that for the future he had a fair Opportunity of good In|telligence from the other World, upon all nece&s;|&s;ary Occa&s;ions, and upon the mo&s;t important En|quiries.</P>
<P>Comforted exceedingly with this Intelligence, he ha&s;tens back to the City, and being &s;ent for to appear before the King, as he expected, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> told him the Occa&s;ion of his &s;ending for him, and how the South&s;ayers and wi&s;e Men were puzzl'd and perplex'd about it, but could give him no Ra|tional Account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="182">Upon this the <HI>Arabian</HI> told the King, that he was &s;orry to find him, <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> made &s;o unea&s;y by the Apprehen&s;ions of a thing, which tho' above the Reach and Under&s;tanding of the Magicians, had yet in it nothing Extraordinary, nothing out of the Cour&s;e of Nature; that there was nothing in it more than the nece&s;&s;ity of its own Motion occa&s;ion'd, and that it had therefore no portentous Import or Signification to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> or to any of his People, or of his Dominions; and that this he might be a&s;&s;ur'd of.</P>
<P>Then he went on, and gave the King an Ac|count of the Nature of the thing, as a <HI>Comet</HI> or <HI>Blazing-&s;tar</HI>; and that Word for Word as the an|cient Stranger <HI>or Spirit</HI> had deliver'd it; and this he did too in the Audience, not of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> only, but of his whole Court; and that with &s;uch a ge|neral Applau&s;e, that all the other Magicians and South&s;ayers acknowledged the Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on of what he &s;aid, and the King was made perfectly ea&s;y upon that Account. From whence they tell us, that the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> tho' in other Ca&s;es the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious People in the World, and that u&s;ed formerly to be the mo&s;t concern'd upon all new <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the Heavens, or upon any un|u&s;ual Appearances, flying immediately to the Divi|nations, and to their South&s;ayers, and Magicians, to interpret and account for &s;uch things to them, are yet, ever &s;ince this Di&s;covery by the <HI>Arabian</HI> South|&s;ayer &s;o long ago, under no Concern at all upon the Appearance of <HI>Comets</HI> or <HI>Blazing-&s;tars,</HI> on any Account what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Arabian.</HI> It was no &s;mall Fame which he gain'd by the Solution he had given of this Appearance of a <HI>Comet; Pharaoh</HI> preferr'd him before all the <HI>Magicians</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and exalt|ed him to divers Honours, but particularly to that of being near his Per&s;on, to coun&s;el and advi&s;e
<PB N="168" REF="183">
him upon all extraordinary Occa&s;ions, as well in Matters of State and Politicks, as Matters of Dif|ficulty: Nor did the re&s;t of the Magicians envy him the Honours he enjoy'd, for they were convinc'd he merited all the King had done for him; and which was more, they did not find they could come at any Part of the extraordinary Intel|ligence or Under&s;tanding in things, which he was Ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as he was too wi&s;e to commu|nicate to any body the &s;ource of his Information, &s;o he was too well &s;atisfied with his new Intelligence, to neglect the Part he was directed to act, which was frequently to meet with the Vi&s;ion, which had once been &s;o favourable to him: In a word, he fol|low'd with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;iduity the begun Inti|macy, and &s;ail'd not to attend the very next Night in particular, after he had made his Speech con|cerning the Comet before the King.</P>
<P>On that occa&s;ion, going towards his Ob&s;ervatory as u&s;ual, he was encounter'd by a Man, in the Ha|bit of an <HI>Aethiopian,</HI> riding upon a Mule, and having a Bow hanging over his Shoulder, a Sheaf of Ar|rows at his Side, and a Lance in his Hand; the Man &s;eem'd to &s;hun him, and offer'd to go forward, but pre&s;ently turn'd back, and with a kind of Compli|ment to the <HI>Arabian</HI> Doctor, enquir'd of him, if there were any way for him to Foord through the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> which at that time of the Year was &s;o low, as to be in &s;ome Places almo&s;t dry, and ea&s;ily pa&s;|&s;able on Hor&s;e-back. The <HI>Arabian</HI> courteou&s;ly an|&s;wer'd him, that there was not any Place near the Road or Track which he was going in, and that he being as he perceiv'd a Stranger and alone, it would be hazardous for him to venture; but that if he would be pleas'd to &s;tay, and go with him to a little Hut which he had hard by, for his Retreat in the Night, he would guide him in the Morning
<PB N="169" REF="184">
to a Place where he &s;hould pa&s;s the River with Safety.</P>
<P>The Traveller thank'd him for the kind Offer, but &s;eem'd rather inclin'd to go on; Sir, &s;ays the <HI>Arabian,</HI> the Night approaches, and you may meet with o|ther Dangers in the way from Crocodiles, Lions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him again to &s;tay; but he declin'd it again, and as to the Dangers he laugh'd at and de&s;pis'd them; Well then, &s;ays the kind ho&s;pi|table <HI>Arabian,</HI> let me &s;end one of my Servants with you to guide you. He &s;eem'd at fir&s;t inclin'd to accept &s;o kind an Offer as that was, but falling a lit|tle farther into Di&s;cour&s;e, the <HI>Arabian</HI> perceiv'd the Stranger began to look pleas'd, and fancying he would accept the fir&s;t Offer, <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;taying all Night, mov'd it again, and with a little additional entreating, the Stranger con&s;ented to that Part, and turn'd back with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian,</HI> tho' with two Servants with him, was always on foot; he had him&s;elf no Weapons, be|ing without fear but of wild Bea&s;ts, again&s;t which his two Servants were his Security, who were armed with Swords and Lances; but the Stranger, well arm'd as above, turning back, they went on fearle&s;s together towards the Hill, which was about the Di&s;tance of two Miles.</P>
<P>In the Way, the <HI>Arabian</HI> was a little &s;hock'd with the unu&s;ual Civility which a great over-grown Crocodile &s;hew'd them; who ru&s;hing out of a mar&s;hy kind of Bog near the Way, came forward towards them, but on a &s;udden turn'd back, and very ob&s;equiou&s;ly crept into the lurking Place, where it had ju&s;t before come out from, and lay &s;till there as quiet as if it had been hu&s;h'd by its own Fears, as perhaps it was.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall Di&s;tance farther they met two She Lions, or as &s;ome call them Lione&s;&s;es; and as they heard them growling at &s;ome Di&s;tance, before they
<PB N="170" REF="185">
were &s;een; they, that is, the <HI>Arabian</HI> and his two Servants, began to &s;how &s;ome Concern about it; but behold, when the Lions appeared, they imme|diately turned about, and fled with the utmo&s;t Pre|cipitation.</P>
<P>After a little farther walking, the <HI>Arabian</HI> turn|ing to his Gue&s;t, told him, There, pointing to the Hill which was clo&s;e at hand, was his little Re|treat, to which he had invited him, and de&s;ired him to leave his Mule with his Servants, and to walk up the little Mount with him; which the Traveller very readily did, bidding his new Land|lord go before to &s;hew him the way, and he would follow him, as al&s;o he did; but what a Surpri&s;e think you was the poor <HI>Arabian</HI> in between Joy and Fright, when turning about at the Top of the A&s;cent to receive his Gue&s;t, he &s;aw nobody but the ancient venerable Stranger, who had at fir&s;t ap|peared to him, and from whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad received &s;o much kind In&s;truction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance before.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apparition</HI> (for &s;uch I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be now called) perceiving him in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, bid him not be &s;urpri&s;ed, for he was &s;till his Friend, and in the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;erve him as before, and asked him whether he came that Night in Ex|pectation of meeting him or not; to which the <HI>A|rabian</HI> replyed, He did, hoping to &s;ee him in Per&s;on or in Vi&s;ion, having &s;omething to offer, which he hoped he would be &s;o kind as to comply with him in.</P>
<P>Upon asking what it was, he told him, That <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had a great Difficulty upon him, and had asked him his Opinion therein, and he knew not what An&s;wer to give.</P>
<P>What is this Difficulty? <HI>&s;ays the Apparition.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays the Arabian,</HI> he has a private Account from his Spies, that <HI>Thermesbus,</HI> the General of the Armies of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> de&s;igns to invade him in the
<PB N="171" REF="186">
Beginning of the Year, with an infinite Number of Troops; and as the King is in greater Readine&s;s to begin the War, than the other, he wants my Opinion whether he &s;hall make War upon <HI>Aethi|opia</HI> forthwith, or &s;tay till he is obliged to do it in his own Defence.</P>
<P>Go you back, <HI>&s;ays the Spectre to him,</HI> and wait till the King &s;ends for you to interpret his Dream or Dreams.</P>
<P>What Dream? <HI>&s;ays the Arabian.</HI></P>
<P>Why to-morrow Night, <HI>&s;ays the Spectre,</HI> the King &s;hall dream, that a black <HI>Elephant</HI> came up to the Gates of his Palace, and that with his mighty Tusks or Teeth he broke down the Gates, and was entring in to make farther Spoil; when the Gates being, <HI>as I &s;ay,</HI> broken down fir&s;t, the Tower which was over the Gates being &s;haken with the Fall, fell down &s;oon after upon the Ele|phant, and well-nigh cru&s;h'd him to death; but that, tho' by his great Strength he bore up the Weight, yet he was &s;o terrified with the Fall of the Tower upon him, that he withdrew into the De&s;art and went quite away.</P>
<P>And what Interpretation &s;hall I give of this Dream? <HI>&s;ays the Arabian.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hall tell him, <HI>&s;ays the Spectre,</HI> That the black Elephant is the King of <HI>Aethiopia</HI>; that he &s;hall &s;end his General to invade him, even to the Gates of his Frontier City of <HI>Zaba,</HI> and &s;hall enter the Gates thereof; but that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> in Garri&s;on within &s;hall break out and fall upon him, and tho' by the great Power of their Troops they &s;hall e&s;cape, yet that they &s;hall retire and go back into the De&s;arts of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and not dare to look upon him any more.</P>
<P>But what then &s;hall I advi&s;e to be done? <HI>&s;ays the Arabian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="187">You will find it mo&s;t rational, <HI>&s;ays the Spectre,</HI> to advi&s;e him to begin the War; and may promi&s;e him Succe&s;s, without Fear; but if not, let him place very great Garri&s;ons in all the Frontier Towns of his Dominions, South, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Zaba</HI> or <HI>Zabda</HI>; and let him wait in a good Po&s;ture of De|fence, till the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Army advances to the Siege of that Place; and &s;o his Dream will come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>This was all wonderful; the <HI>Arab</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed with being thus furni&s;hed for ingratiating him&s;elf with his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>Aegypt</HI>; he knew well enough, that to be able to make <HI>Pharaoh</HI> dream what he plea&s;ed, and then to interpret it how he plea&s;ed, mu&s;t needs make him pa&s;s for a great Man, in a Country too &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly addicted to Dreams, and &s;o unea&s;ie to have tho&s;e Dreams interpreted, as the People of <HI>Aegypt</HI> were.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed, he goes back to the City, where he heard nothing till the third Day in the Morn|ing, when the whole Court was in Di&s;order, all Faces &s;eem'd cloudy, and every Mind di&s;turbed: The News was &s;oon &s;pread into all Parts of the City, that the King had had a frightful and terrible Dream, which had &s;o di&s;tracted his Mind, ('tis &s;uppo&s;ed they did not call him His Maje&s;ty) that he could not re&s;t.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e Men and the South&s;ayers, Magicians and A&s;trologers were immediately &s;ent for in a great hurry to give their Opinion, and interpret <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Dream: The Circum&s;tances of the Dream were much the &s;ame with tho&s;e already mentioned with this Addition, that at the Beginning, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> be|ing in a deep Sleep, heard as he thought a &s;udden great Noi&s;e, that it alarm'd the whole City, and that his Guards, as we call them, or Soldiers which were about him, were awaken'd, but all fled away, and that the City was even left without Defence, only that the Gates were &s;hut.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="188">That in the mid&s;t of this Hurry, a mon&s;trous black Elephant, breaking down all before him, and even overthrowing the Hou&s;es and Buildings which were without the City, came on, no one re&s;i&s;ting him, to the Gates of the City or Ca&s;tle where <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;lept; that with the Force of his mighty Tusks, or Teeth, he beat down the Gates thereof; but that the Tower being &s;haken al&s;o, Part of the Building fell down upon the Back of the Elephant, and, as the King thought at fir&s;t, had cru&s;hed him to Death.</P>
<P>But that notwith&s;tanding the Weight of the Building which fell down was very great, yet that the Elephant by his mighty Strength bore it &s;elf up and received no Injury by it; but being made afraid by the great Blow it received, it withdrew, and retired into the De&s;art towards the South.</P>
<P>None of the Magicians could interpret this Dream, or rather, they could not agree in their In|terpretations of it; &s;ome &s;aid one thing, &s;ome ano|ther, &s;o that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> received no Satisfaction from their Interpretations; whereupon the <HI>Arab,</HI> who appeared at Court purpo&s;ely to be called in, was &s;ummon'd, the King being told that he was there.</P>
<P>He came without any He&s;itation at the fir&s;t Call; and the King, with great Appearance of Di&s;tur|bance, tells him what a &s;trange Dream he had had, how it had di&s;turbed him, and the like, and added, that none of the Interpretations which the wi&s;e Men had given of it, were &s;atisfactory to him, or agreeing with one another. The <HI>Arab</HI> ha|ving then demanded a Particular of the King's Dream, had it related to him as above; then he de|&s;ired to know what Account the Magicians had given of it, and how they had interpreted it; which when he was told, he expre&s;s'd &s;ome Wonder that they &s;hould all amu&s;e the King in &s;uch a manner, and &s;hould &s;ay nothing but what was perfectly remote from the Ca&s;e.</P>

in the Story of the Wonders wrought by <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> where it is allowed that the Magicians wrought by Inchant|ment, which I always under&s;tood to mean by In|voking the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the evil Spirit, and by re|ceiving Help and Secret Powers as well as Intelli|gence from tho&s;e evil Spirits; and be&s;ides the work|ing by Inchantment or Sorcery, &s;o taken Notice of there, we &s;ee it mentioned again in the Book of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> Chap. xvii. &s;peaking of the Plague of Darkne&s;s, he &s;ays, <HI>They were &s;catter'd under a dark Veil of Forgetfulne&s;s, being horribly a&s;toni&s;hed and troubled with (&s;trange) Apparitions, Noi&s;es as of Waters falling down, &s;ounded about them, and &s;ad Vi&s;ions appeared unto them with heavy Countenances.</HI> Ver. 6. <HI>Only there appeared to them a Fire kindled of it &s;elf very dread|ful; for being much terrified, they thought the things which they &s;aw more terrible than the Things they &s;aw not.</HI></P>
<P>Ver. 7. <HI>As for the Illu&s;ions of Art Magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in Wi&s;dom was reproved with Di&s;grace: For they that promi&s;ed to drive away Terrors and Troubles from a &s;ick Soul, were &s;ick them|&s;elves with Fear, and worthy to be laughed at.</HI></P>
<P>This whole Quotation is a De&s;cription of the Darkne&s;s of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in which, according to this Text, there were &s;trange Apparitions, being evi|dently the <HI>Devil</HI> and evil Spirits with human Shapes, horrible Appearances and heavy Counte|nances.</P>
<P>I think this is &s;o plain, as to need no Confir|mation from other Opinions: Magick was reproved, that is to &s;ay, di&s;graced, becau&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> could not a&s;&s;i&s;t the Magician, &s;o as to make any Abate|ment of the Darkne&s;s, which was wrought by Hea|ven; for even the Fire could not be made to give any Light, &s;o the Power of Art, nay even of Ma|gick it &s;elf, was at an End.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="192">In this terrible Ca&s;e, the <HI>Devil</HI> or rather <HI>Devils</HI> were, it &s;eems, permitted to appear in horrible and frightful Shapes, with heavy Countenances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner I cannot doubt but he appeared to the Magicians when he and they had Occa&s;ion to meet and conver&s;e, and carry on their Helli&s;h Combinations, and Confederacies for doing Mi&s;chief; and this brings me of cour&s;e to &s;peak of the Man|ner of the Magicians conver&s;ing with the <HI>Devil,</HI> for hitherto we have only &s;poken of his con|ver&s;ing with them.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is this: Whenever the <HI>Devil</HI> had an Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak with the old <HI>Arab,</HI> or in Ages af|ter that (for the <HI>Arab</HI> was fir&s;t) with <HI>Ali Albrahazen</HI> the Magician of <HI>Saba</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> he knew well how to find them out, and could go to them, meet them in <HI>Apparition,</HI> or &s;peak to them in Vi&s;ion; But what was to be done when they wanted his A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon any Emergency?</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Ali,</HI> mentioned already, &s;tated the Matter for him, namely, that he was to go into the De&s;art to a certain Palm-tree, &s;urround it &s;o many times, call the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o many times in every Circle by &s;uch and &s;uch a Name, and then he would come.</P>
<P>Here was indeed a great deal of Ceremony, be|fore his Wor&s;hip would be &s;poken with; and I cannot but think our Friend <HI>Roger M&mdash;</HI> (Ac|cepted Free Ma&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) &s;peaks with him &s;ometimes upon much ea&s;ier Terms; for the World is grown much nicer of late, than they were then, and the <HI>Devil</HI> is obliged to treat with them on Terms of le&s;s Ceremony.</P>
<P>But the re&s;t of the Story of the old <HI>Arabian</HI> will &s;tate this Matter much clearer, and to the Under|&s;tanding of every Reader; and will let us &s;ee a little what Methods they took to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> in King <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s time, and before our modern Experiments were in u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="193">The <HI>Arab</HI> was now a great Per&s;on, all <HI>Aegypt</HI> re|ceived him as a wonderful Man; his Words were the Oracle of the Day, for whatever he &s;aid came to pa&s;s; he was &s;ent to far and wide, and Me&s;|&s;engers came from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> from <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> nay from <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> for him to come thither, and give the Interpretation of their Vi&s;ions, and explain to them every doubtful Ca&s;e; but he would not leave the Court of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and he was in the right, for the King highly honoured him.</P>
<P>All this while his Reputation wholly depended upon the con&s;tant Intelligence which he kept up with his familiar Spirit (&s;o I may now call it) I mean the Apparition which came to him in the De&s;art; but as this Appearing was arbitrary, and when it plea&s;ed, and might not be at hand when he might have a more than ordinary Occa&s;ion for it, it occurr'd to him one Night to propo&s;e Methods of a more con&s;tant and le&s;s difficult Corre&s;pondence, and that the Apparition might be brought to a greater Familiarity, &s;o as that when any Exigence was upon him, he might be &s;ure of his Aid, might be able to call him to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that he would not &s;ail to appear.</P>
<P>Story does not record what Condition the <HI>Devil</HI> might make with the old <HI>Arab</HI>; as for &s;elling Souls, &s;igning Contracts, <HI>and the like,</HI> it &s;eems to me there was little need of the&s;e things in tho&s;e Days, if there had, and the <HI>Devil</HI> had in&s;i&s;ted on it, I doubt not the <HI>Arabian</HI> would have made no more Scruple of it, than our Brother of the Trowel, who adorns &s;o often his blue Ribband with the mo&s;t honour|able Badge of the Leather Apron; and being fir&s;t incorporated, as above, in the ancient Society of free Th&mdash;s may, for ought we know, build two or three Churches abroad, &s;eeing the <HI>Devil</HI> and he are known to be upon their Travels together.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="194">You have thus a Sketch of Satan's profe&s;s'd Corre&s;pondence with his Agents in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t early Days of the Magick Art; if by tho&s;e Subtilties he brought them into great Re|putation among the People, and in the Courts of Princes, you are not to doubt but he found his Account in it; for by gaining a Reputation to his Agents, and at the &s;ame time keeping them at his Command, for the &s;ake of the Illuminations which they gained from him, he had them always at his hand, ready to do or undertake any thing how|ever black, which in the cour&s;e of their Witch|crafts came in their way. We &s;hall find &s;ome fla|ming Examples of this kind very quickly.</P>
<P>But for the pre&s;ent let us keep to our <HI>Arab</HI> as a Sample or In&s;tance of the ordinary way of &s;uch People in their future Corre&s;pondences; hitherto you &s;ee the <HI>Devil</HI> very a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and, in his way, obliging to the la&s;t degree, to his new Acquain|tance the <HI>Arab.</HI> I will for the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;e he had no other Corre&s;pondent, at lea&s;t not in <HI>Pha|raoh</HI>'s Court, nor was there any need of another; but you are to &s;uppo&s;e he had more &s;uch, or &s;uch like, in other Places.</P>
<P>He had, it &s;eems, found out the Way to make him|&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Arab,</HI> &s;o that the Doctor could not bear the Thoughts of wanting his con&s;tant A&s;&s;i&s;tance: The Sen&s;e of this puts the <HI>Arab</HI> upon propo&s;ing to him, that for the future the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould be &s;o favourable to him as always to come to him whenever he had Occa&s;ion, and this with|out obliging him to go into the De&s;art and up the Hill, in &s;earch of him, which many times the ex|traordinary Demands of the Court would not admit, nor allow him time for.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Devil</HI> did concede this Favour, which was more than he granted to <HI>Ali Albrahazen,</HI> (for he obliged him to come to the Palm-tree, walk &s;o
<PB N="180" REF="195">
many times about it, call aloud &s;o many times upon him every Circle he made) before he would come; I &s;ay, if he yielded to this at the De&s;ire of his Ac|quaintance the <HI>Arab,</HI> it was certainly for the great Ends which were to follow.</P>
<P>Upon his new Propo&s;al, Mea&s;ures were &s;tated be|tween them that upon &s;uch and &s;uch formal ma|naging, (for there was &s;ome Rea&s;on, it &s;eems, to make it a Piece of great Formality,) the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould always, that is &s;ome of the innumerable Le|gions, &s;hould always appear; whether Satan him&s;elf, or &s;ome of his Me&s;&s;engers, Servants, or <HI>Gentlemen in waiting,</HI> Hi&s;tory indeed is not &s;o particular as that I &s;hould be able to give you the Names of them, whether Chri&s;tian Name or Sirname, as in other Ca&s;es might be expected.</P>
<P>The Forms of his appearing, the Occa&s;ion, the Conditions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being thus left to the <HI>Arab</HI> to de|termine as &s;hould be for his Occa&s;ion; let us &s;ee how near we can come to the Particulars.</P>

<P>It was no doubt a great Conde&s;cention that the Devil would &s;toop to be always at hand, and to come when he was called; but he found his Ac|count in it: the <HI>Arab</HI> now had him at his Beck, and whenever <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had any difficult thing to pro|po&s;e, the old <HI>Arab</HI> could as they call it rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> when he plea&s;ed, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it.</P>

<P>Now from the &s;ame Text we &s;hall prove that the&s;e were Practices in the Nations of that Part of the World, even long before the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came into the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> See the &s;ame Chapter, Ver&s;e 12. <HI>And becau&s;e of tho&s;e Abominations the LORD thy GOD doth drive them out from before thee.</HI> And again, Ver. 14. <HI>For the&s;e Nations which thou &s;halt po&s;&s;e&s;s hearkened unto Ob&s;ervers of Times, and un|to Diviners.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;uch a one was this <HI>Arab</HI>; let him act as he did, and be that how it will, 'tis evident he had a <HI>Familiar</HI>; the meaning is, he was in or under a Covenant with the <HI>Devil</HI>; he had made an Agree|ment with the Apparition for continuing the Cor|re&s;pondence, and for attending him con&s;tantly, to
<PB N="182" REF="197">
furni&s;h him for his Predictions, foretelling Events, and acquainting them with &s;ecret and hidden things.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the known Interpretations of the&s;e &s;eve|ral Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>having a Familiar, u&s;ing Divination, Inchantments,</HI> &amp;c. All imply a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Devil,</HI> to help them in &s;uch extraordinary Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Such a &s;ort of People it &s;eems there was among the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> that is to &s;ay the <HI>Phoenicians</HI>; and the Abomination was come to &s;uch a height, and God had born with it &s;o many Ages, that now he was re&s;olved to drive out tho&s;e Nations, for this very Crime: Now, as there were &s;uch People among the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> no doubt but there were &s;uch a|mong the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> too, from whom the&s;e People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out, and who, tho' with the <HI>fir&s;t-born</HI> of their Children &s;lain in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the Lo&s;s of their Army and King in the Waters of the Red-Sea and other Calamities, they were reduced low enough at the Time that we read of them, yet were a &s;trong and powerful Nation, even from the time of <HI>Mizraim</HI> their greate&s;t Monarch after <HI>Cham.</HI></P>
<P>As they were a powerful and great People, &s;o they were a wi&s;e and learned Nation, as Wi&s;dom and Knowledge went then in the World, and there|fore we find, that however the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>Ara|bians</HI> boa&s;t that they were the fir&s;t Searchers into the My&s;teries of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, and that the fir&s;t Rudiments of the cele&s;tial Studies were conceiv'd among them, which yet does not appear other than in their Pretences; yet &s;uppo&s;e it, or &s;uppo&s;e we were to grant it, we &s;till find that they went to <HI>Aegypt</HI> for their Practice and Encou|ragement; that perhaps in <HI>Arabia</HI> they might drink in the fir&s;t Knowledge and Principles of things; But <HI>Arabia,</HI> a Country always poor, and not able to give Encouragement to Learning, as we

&s;ay of a Neighbouring Country, afforded Nothing but the dry Study, they mu&s;t go farther for the Im|provement of it; in &s;hort they might &s;tay at home, and get Knowledge, but they mu&s;t go abroad if they would get Money.</P>
<P>This was the Rea&s;on that, as it is at this time &s;ome|where el&s;e, as &s;oon as the Poor Wretches had got a little &s;mattering of <HI>Arabian,</HI> Mountain Wit, and a little Star-gazing Knowledge, away they went to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and there they &s;et up immediately for wi&s;e Men and Conjurers, and we &s;carce know what of Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> a wealthy but from the very Be|ginning a &s;uper&s;titious kind of People, always hunt|ing after &s;ecret Interpretations, and hidden re&s;erved Events, poring upon rather than under&s;tanding my&s;te|rious things, and loving to have &s;trange Stories told them by any one, e&s;pecially Foreigners, gaped eagerly after the fine Tales of the&s;e &s;econd-&s;ighted <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nk in their Magick as it was then called, and freely parted with their Money to have their Fortunes told them, and the Lines in their Palms explain'd to them by the crafty wandering <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>On the contrary, the cunning Arti&s;ts, that, tho' they knew nothing of the matter at fir&s;t, yet &s;ee|ing plainly that even that little was e&s;teemed a great deal, while the People they talked with knew le&s;s, and finding the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> ea&s;ie to be impo&s;ed upon, willing to be cheated, and particularly con|tented to have their Pockets pick'd for the Satis|fying their &s;imple Curio&s;ity; I &s;ay, the cunning wandering Strangers made a good Market of them, grew rich and famous among them, and kept up the Reputation of their Craft by all the Subtilties of Wit and Invention.</P>
<P>This Succe&s;s encouraging their Studies, we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e they pu&s;hed into all manner of na|tural Enquiries, and as far as they were able im|proved

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Practice and Progre&s;s of Magick, as it is now explain'd to be a Diabolical Art; how it &s;pread it &s;elf in the World, and by what Degrees it grew up to the Height which it has &s;ince arriv'd to.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have pitch'd upon <HI>Aegypt</HI> to be the Spot where the fir&s;t helli&s;h Arti&s;ts &s;tudy'd this that I now call Diabolical Magick. I &s;hall not keep you long upon the cold Scent. It was practis'd there very early, and very long, before we heard much of it any where el&s;e; but when it took a run, when it &s;tarted from thence, we &s;hall &s;oon hear of it a|broad: For however &s;ecret the Black Part may be, and however private the <HI>Magicians</HI> and their great Ma&s;ter the <HI>Devil</HI> manag'd their Corre&s;pondence, yet the Practice of it, and the Game they play'd upon Mankind by it, was always publick and open, as we &s;hall have rea&s;on to &s;ay, among other Nations, as well as among our own.</P>
<P>As to the Chronology of it, and when it began, in what Ages of the World tho&s;e <HI>Arabians</HI> began to practi&s;e as above, when they fir&s;t dealt in this
<PB N="185" REF="200">
Craft, when the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> began to be their Scho|lars, and they the <HI>Devil</HI>'s, it is not (however ancient) &s;o difficult to come at the Knowledge of in ge|neral, as &s;ome other things in the World, which yet we think our &s;elves very certain of.</P>
<P><HI>The Scripture,</HI> whether our good Friends that read Books in this Age will bear with our quoting it in Matters of Religion or no, yet is generally allow'd to be a tolerable good Hi&s;tory. Nay, if we may believe &s;ome good Authors, it mu&s;t be al|low'd to be the mo&s;t ancient Hi&s;tory, and the Writing from which all other Authorities take their Ri&s;e; that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was long before <HI>Bero&s;us, Homer, He&s;iod,</HI> or in a word, any of the Writers on Earth. Nor could it be well otherwi&s;e, if what is lately advanc'd is true, that the fir&s;t Knowledge of Let|ters to write by, and to read upon, was dictated to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> by the immediate Re|velation of Heaven. I &s;ay it could not be otherwi&s;e. For how &s;hould they write before they had Letters, and knew how to form the &s;ound of Words upon the Tables, where they were impre&s;t?</P>
<P>As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had the fir&s;t Knowledge of Letters, &s;o he had the fir&s;t Knowledge of Things too, and was therefore the be&s;t qualified to be a Collector of Antiquities; nor was it &s;o difficult a Matter for <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> to write a Hi&s;tory of the Creation, and of all the material Events of things that had happen'd before his time, as &s;ome may imagine: Since by the Cal|culations of Time, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might ea&s;ily have an Ac|count of tho&s;e things by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Supply of <HI>Oral Tradition</HI> from <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf, as you may ga|ther from the Times wherein he liv'd, and the Per&s;ons with whom he had convers'd; of which take the following &s;hort Sketch, as a leading Thread or Chain of things directly confirming my Argument.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="201">If <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> then had the mo&s;t early Knowledge of things by a &s;hort Succe&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;ons relating them, and that even from <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> in a right Line; and if <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had the fir&s;t Knowledge of Letters, even immediately from a &s;uperior Hand, then at lea&s;t you mu&s;t allow me, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was certainly the be&s;t qualify'd to form a Hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cted in the World; and was the fir&s;t Man, or at lea&s;t the Man be&s;t able to write that Hi&s;tory down. For who could form a Hi&s;tory of things they did not know? and who could write before they had Letters to form the Words he was to write by? and who could read what was written, unle&s;s tho&s;e Letters had been known, and made publick in the World?</P>
<P>Hence I infer that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was the fir&s;t Hi&s;torian, and the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> are the fir&s;t Hi&s;tory in the World; and if the fir&s;t, con&s;equently mo&s;t likely to be the be&s;t Authority; at lea&s;t, as I have &s;aid a|bove (and that my Readers may not be pu&s;h'd upon too hard, to believe tho&s;e Books which they have &s;o ill a reli&s;h of) I &s;ay at lea&s;t, they will allow that the Scripture or <HI>Pentateuch</HI> is a tolerable good Hi|&s;tory, and that is all I ask of them as a Favour.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, It &s;eems that God re&s;olv'd to drive out the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> that is the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> before the Chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> even for this very Offence among others; and I cannot come up to the modern rate of Sceptici&s;m, as to believe God would have driven them out of their Country, for a Crime which they were not guilty of; and e&s;pecially too, that he would have a&s;&s;ign'd that for a Rea&s;on of it, which the poor People could have &s;tood up and clear'd them&s;elves of, and have &s;aid they did not under|&s;tand what it was.</P>

<P>Certainly, GOD's Promi&s;e to turn out the Inha|bitants for <HI>Abram</HI>'s Po&s;terity mu&s;t be allow'd to be a Sentence of Condemnation upon the <HI>Canaa|nites</HI> even at that time; and he would not have con|demned them to Bani&s;hment, I mean as a Nation, for Crimes which they were not even then guilty of; e&s;pecially that very Crime being a&s;&s;ign'd as the Cau&s;e of their &s;aid Condemnation and Sentence.</P>
<P>If this Argument is ju&s;t, as I think it mu&s;t be, then I have gain'd the Point as to the Antiquity; for then this Crime of Diabolical Magick is as ancient as <HI>Abram</HI>; and 'tis evident <HI>Abram</HI> was born above fifty &s;ix Years before <HI>Noah</HI> died. How long this wicked Trade was known before <HI>Abram,</HI> we can|not determine, but may grant it might be &s;ome con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="203">It is certain however that in the Reign of <HI>Miz|raim,</HI> who was but the Grand&s;on of <HI>Noah,</HI> they were grown very con&s;iderable, I mean as to their Reputation, in the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Court; and I am wil|ling to &s;uppo&s;e my old <HI>Arab</HI> was one of the Chief, if not one of the fir&s;t of them in <HI>Mizraim</HI>'s Reign, and perhaps near the Beginning of it: For as the <HI>Devil</HI> introduc'd him&s;elf as it were Voluntier to him, it &s;hould &s;eem that he had no Corre&s;pondents of that kind there before, and took that Method to begin his Acquaintance; perhaps allowing his Corre&s;pondents to convey the &s;ame Method of In|telligence from one to another, and perhaps to re|new the Contract as often as he their In&s;tructor thought fit.</P>
<P>But be that how it will, 'tis certain the <HI>Devil</HI> mu&s;t be Aggre&s;&s;or, in all Ages, of this Art. He knew well enough how to break in upon them, how to &s;how him&s;elf, and make his Appearances to them as often as he thought fit; and could begin it, or renew it, how, and whenever he pleas'd. But the Ca&s;e was quite different on their Side, for no body knew how to come at him, they did not &s;o much as know him when they &s;aw him, or know where he liv'd, where he kept his Re&s;idence; how to go to him, or &s;end to him; or, in a word, to have any Corre&s;pondence with him, but ju&s;t as he thought fit to enter into a Familiarity with them, and give them Methods and Rules by which they &s;hould ob|tain Audience of him, when, and as often us they had occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it is not to be wonder'd that the <HI>Devil,</HI> and tho&s;e Men of Craft, became ac|quainted very &s;oon in the World; for the <HI>Devil</HI> is too diligent to neglect his own Affairs any longer than till they were ripe for his Agitation.</P>

<P>I hope our Mo&s;t Reverend, and Right Reverend of the &s;acerdotal Order in the&s;e Days, and in this wi&s;e Magical Age, will take no Offence at me for this, at lea&s;t till I have farther and fully explain'd my &s;elf. Far be it from us (and &s;ad would be our Circum&s;tances &s;hould I venture) to &s;ugge&s;t that any of our Clergy &s;hould be Conjurers, and deal in Magick: no, no; plenty of Grace, and paucity of Brains, I hope, is our e&s;tabli&s;h'd Protection from &s;uch a di&s;mal Eruption as that would be upon us.</P>
<P>In order therefore to explain my &s;elf fully upon this Subject, I mu&s;t go back to the early Ages of the World, even ju&s;t where I was before. The <HI>Devil,</HI> after the Flood, ob&s;erving the World begin to fill, and that the People &s;preading them&s;elves over it, began to People it again, and form them|&s;elves into Nations, and Governments; one of his fir&s;t Cares was to debauch their Principles as to Religion, to dictate fal&s;e Notions of Homage and Wor&s;hip to them, and, in a word, to introduce Ido|latry.</P>
<P>As he knew perfectly well the End he aim'd at, &s;o he was not at a lo&s;s to find out the Means. It would be too long a Story to tell you, in what manner he found out Gods for them to wor&s;hip, and how he canoniz'd their Heroes for them. The

Tale of <HI>Ninus</HI> or <HI>Nimrod</HI> appearing to the wi&s;e Men in a Flame of Fire, and telling them, he was going ju&s;t then up into Heaven, from whence he would always &s;hine upon them in the Shape of a Star, and that they &s;hould build a Temple to the glory of his Memory; that he &s;hould be call'd <HI>Baal</HI> or <HI>Bell,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay <HI>a great God,</HI> and that he would be always ready to help them again&s;t their Enemies, as he was to fight for them while he was alive;</P>
<P>I &s;ay, this Tale, &s;uppo&s;e it but a Tale, was not at all unlikely to take with the People, who had the Memory of their dead Hero-King fre&s;h in their Thought, and who were ready to idolize the very empty Sound of his Name. Suppo&s;e the wi&s;e Men as they call'd them, only feign'd, or forg'd this Story, and reported it to the People as a Vi&s;ion which they had really &s;een, tho' they had not &s;een it at all, yet it was not unlikely to make Impre&s;&s;ions upon them, in their fir&s;t Ignorance of things.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, on the other hand, the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is always awake, &s;hould have really &s;hown him&s;elf in &s;uch an Appearance, and then have drawn in the wi&s;e <HI>Magicians</HI> of that Age, upon &s;eeing &s;uch a Sight frightful and horrid like the <HI>Devil,</HI> that form'd it, to relate (as they might with Truth,) the Fact to the People: It was not at all &s;trange, that the wi&s;e Men mention'd &s;hould go to the King with that Story al&s;o; and that he the King, bi|gotted by the <HI>Magicians,</HI> and terrify'd as they were, &s;hould immediately order a Temple to be erected, Sacrifices to be appointed, and a formal Wor&s;hip &s;et on foot, to the Honour of this great God <HI>Bell,</HI> who&s;e Memory was &s;o high in their E&s;teem be|fore.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory is very full of the fir&s;t Fury of idola|trous Zeal, and of the extravagant Branches of their Devotion, I mean in their Princes. <HI>Ninus</HI>

<P>As tho&s;e Idols were introduc'd by the Art of the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;o it mu&s;t be that the Direction came from him; I mean as to the manner of the Idol-wor&s;hip, and that he certainly held an immediate Corre&s;pon|dence with the In&s;titutors and Managers of the Idol Rites.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Magicians and A&s;trologers, who by his Directions were in&s;tructed what Cere|monies, what Rites, what manner of Wor&s;hip to offer to their Gods; and as they con&s;ulted the Ma|gicians for the In&s;titution of their Wor&s;hip, &s;o in a few Ages after the Magicians or South&s;ayers were their Prie&s;ts, and their Prie&s;ts were all Ma|gicians and South&s;ayers. Hence the Auru&s;pices, the Sacrificers, and the Prie&s;ts of the &s;everal Tem|ples, where An&s;wers were given to Que&s;tions, E|vents predicted, and the like, were the Givers of tho&s;e An&s;wers from the Oracle; that is in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Prie&s;ts were Magicians, and the Magi|cians were the Prie&s;ts, and the <HI>Devil</HI> brought <HI>Witchcraft</HI> and <HI>Idolatry</HI> to be at la&s;t but one Sci|ence.</P>
<P>As he corre&s;ponded per&s;onally with <HI>Ali Albraha|zen,</HI> and the old <HI>Arab,</HI> in the Infancy of time, and when his Kingdom was, as it were, but ju&s;t erecting and &s;etting up in the World, &s;o when that Per&s;onal

<P>Nothing could be more agreeable to the Prie&s;ts of their Idols, than this Intimacy with the Infer|nal Spirits; for the <HI>Devil,</HI> who was always his Craft's Ma&s;ter, fail'd not as well to delude the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, as by them to impo&s;e upon the World; nor could he have carry'd on his Game upon Mankind without it. For if the Prie&s;ts had not believ'd that they convers'd with the Gods, when really they convers'd with the <HI>Devil</HI>; if they had been all let into the Secret, and made to pro|pagate their Religion as a Cheat upon the World, to which they were to have been privy; if it had all been known to be, as it really was, a Con&s;piracy again&s;t Heaven in Favour of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and with real De|&s;ign to impo&s;e upon and damn the World, they would never have been brought univer&s;ally to have kept the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Council, and have come into the Plot, at the Price of their eternal Felicity, and the Souls of all their Friends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI>'s Plot would certainly have been blown long before it was, and the Prie&s;ts of the Oracles would mo&s;t certainly have fir&s;t or la&s;t have betray'd their Ma&s;ter, and expos'd the whole Cheat. But the Ca&s;e was evidently this, the <HI>Devil</HI> found the way to delude and impo&s;e upon the very Prie&s;ts them&s;elves; and not only &s;ugge&s;ted to them, but made them really believe, that the Gods convers'd with them, that the Voices they heard, the An&s;wers dictated by their Oracles, the Apparitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were all the real Appearances of their Gods, tho&s;e in particular who&s;e Servants and Prie&s;ts they were; when in Truth it was no more than a gro&s;s Delu&s;ion, and an Appearance of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>

<P>It may &s;eem a little difficult to bring all the Schemes of Idol or Pagan Wor&s;hip down to a Level with Witchcraft and Diabolical Magick; and &s;ome will tell us, that &s;everal Parts of the Pagan Wor&s;hip, or even Pagani&s;m in general, was e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon pure and ju&s;t Principles, an exact and regular Virtue, the height of Morals, prin|ciples of Truth, and of natural Religion, of good Government, and of Dedication to the publick Welfare of Mankind; nay even upon Principles of Piety, and a Homage to be paid to the Divine Be|ing, as the fir&s;t moving Cau&s;e of Life, and as a Debt due to that Being, for all the good attending Hu|man Life; that nothing has been wanting in &s;ome Pagans but a Revelation from Heaven, and an open|ing the Eyes of the Soul by Divine In&s;piration, to know the Only True God.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are of this Opinion, &s;upport it by the Example of <HI>Numa Pompilius,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Roman</HI> Rites, and to whom the e&s;tabli&s;hing the greater part of the Pagan Ceremonies is ju&s;tly a&s;|&s;ign'd; who, they tell us, acted upon the highe&s;t

Principles of Morality and Virtue, and even of Piety; that he went even to the utmo&s;t length that Nature and Rea&s;on could go; that he not only acknowledg'd a Supreme Power, to whom Man|kind ow'd his Homage for the good receiv'd, and who would not fail, in a Life to come, to di&s;tribute Rewards and Puni&s;hments, agreeable to the Life and Conduct of every Man here: But own'd al&s;o that Wor&s;hip as a Natural Debt, to be paid by all Man|kind; hence upon the Door of the Temple of the &s;everal Gods he caus'd to be written, as a Direction to all Mankind, this &s;hort Precept, <HI>&agrave; Jove princi|pium</HI>; intimating that every Action of Man's Life &s;hould be begun with Application to the Gods.

<P>This appears in the Particular mention'd above, namely, that notwith&s;tanding Man's infallible Judg|ment led him to the Knowledge of a Divine Be|ing, and that there was a great fir&s;t Cau&s;e, Infi|nite, Eternal and Superior, becau&s;e Prior to all Be|ing, and that this fir&s;t Being had a Right to the Homage and Obedience of his Creatures; yet 'till God by Revelation directed it, all the Perfection of human Judgment could never lead Mankind to a right Knowledge of the Wor&s;hip and Homage this Great Being requir'd. But they &s;unk down in|to Idolatry, wor&s;hipping many Gods, and Images, the Repre&s;entations of Gods; and in a word, into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and dulle&s;t Conceptions of things re|lating to their Deities, &s;uch as one would think it was impo&s;&s;ible humane Judgment, under any manner of Improvement, could fall into; things unworthy of GOD, nay unworthy of Men.

of the Wor&s;hip of the true God, but to pay the Homage they ow'd to their Maker, to him who was their De&s;troyer and Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Numa,</HI> with all his Sincerity and Piety, re|&s;olv'd all his Ideas into a confus'd Ma&s;s of idola|trous Ceremonies, adorning the Prie&s;ts, forming new Orders and Degrees of his Clergy; and, in a word, drawing a Scheme of pompous Pagani&s;m; e&s;tabli&s;hing Games, and inhumane Fightings of Gladiators, Races and Exerci&s;es for Sport, in Ho|nour of the Gods: Be&s;ides crowding the City with Temples and Altars, to innumerable and unknown Deities; &s;o that, in a word, after he had acknowledg'd that there was a &s;upreme Power, a GOD of all the Earth, a great fir&s;t Cau&s;e of Life, and to whom all Homage was due, I &s;ay, after all the&s;e &s;ublime Ideas, he yet &s;unk down into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all Ido|latries, the wor&s;hipping imaginary Gods, deifying the Stars of Heaven, and offering Sacrifices, build|ing Temples, dedicating Prie&s;ts, and making Vows to Stocks and Stones, the Work of their own Fingers, and the Idols of their own Brain.</P>

<P>Yet all this while their Religion was Devil-wor|&s;hip; their Augurs and South&s;ayers, and the Prie&s;ts of their Temples and Oracles, were Diviners, <HI>Ma|gicians,</HI> Wizards, and in the very Letter of it <HI>Deal|ers with the Devil,</HI> and that in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e; all their Sacrifices, and their In&s;titution of Games, for appea&s;ing the angry Gods, were the mo&s;t horrid and barbarous Pieces of Ignorance, or helli&s;h Cru|elty and Brutality, that could be imagin'd, even &s;ometimes to human Sacrifices; and in all tho&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es of their Devotion, the <HI>Devil</HI> led them on blinded by &s;trong Delu&s;ions to &s;uch Performances, in order to appea&s;e the Wrath of Heaven, as were unworthy of God, incon&s;i&s;tent with his Nature, as a bountiful beneficent Being, as a fountain of Good|ne&s;s and Mercy, infinitely Compa&s;&s;ionate to his Creatures; and who could not take Plea&s;ure in tho&s;e things which were injurious to Mankind, in order to be reconcil'd to them, or be pacify'd by de&s;troying tho&s;e, whom it was his glory to &s;ave and protect.</P>
<P>All the while that they erected Temples to Ju|&s;tice, to Honour, to Virtue, and to Peace, they &s;tudied all po&s;&s;ible ways, by War, and Blood, to a|ma&s;s Trea&s;ures, and enlarge their Empire, 'till, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tories confe&s;s, they left no Na|tion un&s;ubdued, except &s;uch as they found it not in
<PB N="200" REF="215">
their Power, or worth their while to Conquer; that is to &s;ay, &s;uch as the <HI>Parthians,</HI> who were too powerful for them to conquer, and &s;o poor when conquer'd, as not to be worth the Attempt; or the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> who tho' rich, yet were &s;o remote and fenc'd by wide unpa&s;&s;able De&s;arts, and protected by the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Climate, &s;o that it was not in their Power to a&s;&s;ault them. Their Armies were not able to endure the March thro' the <HI>Libyan</HI> Sands, or over the Mountains and va&s;t Waters of <HI>India,</HI> under or near the Equinox, and where there was nothing to &s;helter or relieve them under the exce&s;&s;ive and violent Force of the Sun.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the World, as I have &s;aid, they continually invaded and &s;ubdued, and matter'd not the Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice of the War, if the Reward of their Trea&s;ures, and the Advantage of Govern|ing them, was apparent.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> invaded the <HI>Gauls,</HI> the <HI>Helvetians,</HI> the <HI>Germans,</HI> without any ju&s;t Pretence of making War, except only that of Conque&s;t, Plunder and Dominion. What Pretence of War had the <HI>Romans</HI> again&s;t a quiet, a remote, an inoffen&s;ive Nation, as the <HI>Britains</HI> certainly were? They neither offer'd to di&s;turb the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, or were in Condition to do it; having no Knowledge of Arms equal to any &s;uch Attempt, no Alliances or Cor|respondence with any of the <HI>Romans</HI> Enemies, no Ships to traver&s;e the Ocean, and make them ter|rible.</P>
<P>Nothing call'd <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> over hither to invade the innocent <HI>Britains,</HI> but thir&s;t of Glory, and enlarg|ing Dominion; a Principle imbib'd from the tyrannick Nature of the <HI>Devil</HI>; to rai&s;e humane Glory, not by Deeds truly Great, not by virtuous Actions, but by de&s;troying and in&s;ulting the Weak in Pre&s;umption of Strength, and by &s;hedding
<PB N="201" REF="216">
Blood to triumph over the Wrongs and Oppre&s;|&s;ion of their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P>And what was the Reward of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Ambition and Thir&s;t of Glory? A Conque&s;t indeed he gain'd; but of what, and for whom? a Conque&s;t of Inno|cence, and a Conque&s;t for the <HI>Devil</HI>; the fruit of which was thus to be &s;umm'd up: They, fir&s;t and la&s;t, de&s;troyed two Millions, &s;ome think five or &s;ix Millions, of the Inhabitants; they &s;pilt al&s;o an Ocean <HI>Roman</HI> Blood; eighty thou&s;and <HI>Romans</HI> were killed at one time by the gallant Queen <HI>Boadicia</HI> at <HI>Ca|molodinum,</HI> now <HI>Malden</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; and after a Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of above &s;ix hundred Years, they were forc'd to abandon it with Infamy and Scandal, and &s;o end|ed ju&s;t, where they began.</P>
<P>Whence was all this, but from the <HI>Devil?</HI> who&s;e Government of the World had this Magick in|deed always in it, that it &s;pread Cruelty and Ty|ranny in all Parts, founded Dominion in Blood, and made the World a Theatre of Rapin and Vio|lence.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ecret Magick of his Government, and yet this was always carried on under the Mask of Ju&s;tice, Peace and Religion; that is to &s;ay, Ava|rice was Ju&s;tice, and to gain the Plunder of a Na|tion was a &s;ufficient Pretence to quarrel with and &s;ubdue it: Conque&s;t then brought Peace; that is to &s;ay, when Rapin or Slaughter had impoveri&s;h'd or extirpated a People, then the <HI>Romans</HI> gave them Peace, and protected the Remnant; and as to Reli|gion, the Sub&s;tance of it was, as above, Cruelty and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of the <HI>Roman Polity,</HI> and of the Methods taken in a Government and by a People who, as above, are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t civilized of all the Pagan Nations and Governments in the World; and this, in a word, &s;erves to open the Eyes of Po&s;terity, and betrays the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Con&s;pi|racy
<PB N="202" REF="217">
again&s;t Mankind in the opene&s;t manner po&s;|&s;ible. The Magick of Hell di&s;covers it &s;elf here, that under the &s;pecious Pretence of ju&s;t Govern|ment, and under the Fame of a civiliz'd Nation, governing them&s;elves and the World by the Rules of Ju&s;tice and Virtue, a Loo&s;e was given to all man|der of Barbari&s;ms, Cruelty, Blood and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is clear in &s;o many Examples, that I need &s;ay no more to explain it, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Govern|ment and the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion was all founded on a Diabolical Regimen, and was maintained by the Magick and Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifice of the <HI>Devil</HI> and his In&s;tru|ments; which In&s;truments were chiefly the Prie&s;ts of the Idol Temples and Wor&s;hip, who by the Subtilty of their Arts (Religious Art, the wor&s;t &s;ort of Magick) made &s;uch deep Impre&s;&s;ions on the Minds of the deluded World, that not the com|mon &s;ort only, not the Vulgar, or as we &s;ay the <HI>Canaile,</HI> the Mobb and Rabble of the People came into it, and believed the lying Wonders; but the learned World, the Philo&s;ophers, the Poets, Men of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Parts, and the mo&s;t polite Know|ledge, nay of the noble&s;t Principles of Virtue, and who had the mo&s;t refined Ideas of Ju&s;tice and Honour, even the&s;e all came into the Delu&s;ions of this <HI>Black Art,</HI> believed, and, as I may &s;ay, reli&s;hed the Witch|craft and Delu&s;ions of the Magicians and Sorcerers, and were taken with their lying Wonders; even the <HI>Cato's,</HI> the <HI>Tully's,</HI> the great and the greate&s;t He|roes, Philo&s;ophers, Scholars, 'twas all one, they were &s;wallowed up by the Arts of the Magicians and South&s;ayers; nay, their Kings &s;tooped to deal in this <HI>Black Art</HI> them&s;elves. <HI>Romulus</HI> the Founder of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the fir&s;t Father even of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name, was him&s;elf a South&s;ayer; that is to &s;ay, a Magician, a Diviner or Inchanter; in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a Dealer with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and the great Pro|pagator of the infernal Art; I &s;ay, the great Pro|pagator
<PB N="203" REF="218">
of it, for he was the fir&s;t that in&s;tituted the <HI>Augurs</HI> in the Pagan Wor&s;hip, and, as I &s;aid, Hook'd in the Magicians into their Religion, making all the Wizards and Conjurers, Prie&s;ts; tho' I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, not <HI>Romulus, Numa,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, could make all the Prie&s;ts Conjurers, no not to this Day.</P>
<P>Some have been of Opinion that <HI>Numa Pompilius,</HI> who I have &s;aid was &s;incerely inclin'd to Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it was &s;imply under&s;tood to be a meer Homage due from Man a Creature, to God the Creator; that he acted from a &s;incere Principle, and that he went farther towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the true Religion, than any Pagan in the World ever did before him.</P>
<P>But they add, he was lo&s;t for want of revealed Light: that having determined by the Light of his Rea&s;on that there was a God, and that he was to be wor&s;hipped, but not knowing how or in what manner that Wor&s;hip was to be directed, and not being able to find out by his utmo&s;t Search what Wor&s;hip would be acceptable, He &s;unk into Idolatry and Polythei&s;m, as the only Pattern that was before him; with this Addition, that having thus taken his Ri&s;e from a wrong Beginning, his devout Temper hurried him on into all the Ex|tremes of Idolatry and Pagani&s;m, 'till at length he came into this very Mi&s;chief I am &s;peaking of, I mean, Magick, Sorcery, and dealing with familiar Spirits, that is, the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>This is ju&s;t what I had &s;aid already; but it is mo&s;t certain, that though at fir&s;t they acted up|on &s;ome Foundation of natural Principles, or if you plea&s;e, Principles of Natural Religion: Yet they afterwards run farther into this Sorcery and South&s;aying, and that with &s;uch an univer&s;al Gu&s;t of Inclination, that it became a chief Part of their Religion; and there were very few of their great Men, nay even of their Kings and Empe|rors,
<PB N="204" REF="219">
but what were Magicians them&s;elves; and &s;ome of them, if not all of them, took it for a Part of their Imperial Titles, and a Badge of their Honour, to be called <HI>Pontifex Maximus,</HI> and &s;ome|times appeared in the Robes of a Sacrificer, and of this or that Order of the Prie&s;ts, as they thought fit; 'till at length un&s;ufferable Pride and In&s;olence led them to accept of divine Honours them&s;elves, to lay a&s;ide the Prie&s;t, and a&s;&s;ume that of a God; placing them&s;elves &s;o above the Sacrificer, as to &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be &s;acrificed to: But this went but a little Way.</P>
<P>At length the Chri&s;tian Religion, in &s;pite of Per&s;ecution and ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, both from the Jews as well as the Pagans, began to &s;pread it &s;elf in the World: and as Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;ays, that he came to de&s;troy the Works of the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;o it ap|peared; for immediately the Glories of the Pagan Su|per&s;tition began to fade, their Oracles ceas'd, the Prie&s;ts became dumb; and the <HI>Devil,</HI> not able to car|ry on the Cheat any farther, threw it up; the Au|gurs and South&s;ayers fled from the Face of the Chri|&s;tian Doctrine, and from the Preaching of the A|po&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors, as not able to exerci&s;e their Sorceries and Divinations, no not &s;o much as in the Pre&s;ence of the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>We have two remarkable In&s;tances of this in the &s;acred Text; one is <HI>Acts</HI> xiii.7. when being at the I&s;le of <HI>Cyprus, Elymas</HI> the Sorcerer ventured to with&s;tand St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he preached the Word of God to <HI>Sergius Paulus</HI> the Governour; but for the audacious Attempt was &s;truck blind by the miraculous Word of the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, &s;o being made an In&s;trument to confirm the Governour in his Faith, and compleat the Conver&s;ion which the conjuring Wretch &s;ought to oppo&s;e, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. <HI>The Deputy, when he &s;aw what was done, believed, being a&s;toni&s;hed at the Doctrine of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="220">The other In&s;tance is in <HI>Acts</HI> xix.19. where indeed there is a double Evidence; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> of the Power of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine prevailing over the Magick and Diabolick Arts then in Practice; and, <HI>Secondly,</HI> of the prodigious Encrea&s;e of tho&s;e Magical Delu|&s;ions among the <HI>Romans,</HI> however wi&s;e and polite a People they were; the Story is &s;hort, and fully to the purpo&s;e. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> preaching at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> made a wonderful Progre&s;s in converting the Pagans of that great City, to the Chri&s;tian Faith. Some Hi|&s;tories tell us, he converted one hundred thou&s;and People there and in the Country adjacent; but that by the way: In a word, the Text &s;ays, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. <HI>the Name of the Lord Je&s;us was magnify'd.</HI> And how, but by this eminent Victory over the <HI>Devil?</HI> For (be&s;ides the Conque&s;t of the Exorci&s;ts who went a|bout to ca&s;t out a <HI>Devil</HI> by their Conjurings and Spells) the Magicians them&s;elves were converted by <HI>Paul</HI>'s preaching, and that to a prodigious Number of them, <HI>ver.</HI> 19. <HI>Many al&s;o of them which u&s;ed cu|rious Arts, brought their Books together, and burned them before all Men: and they counted the Price of them, and found it fifty thou&s;and Pieces of Silver.</HI> What a height mu&s;t the Black Art of the <HI>Devil</HI> be come to at that time, that the Books which were to be found in that one City &s;hould amount to &s;uch a Sum of Money? I give this Account, as I have &s;aid, to let you &s;ee to what an extravagant height the <HI>Devil</HI> had carried this Matter; and how and in what manner he &s;upported his Intere&s;t in the World. But I mu&s;t go back to the Beginning of things, where I left off, <HI>viz.</HI> at the In&s;titution of the <HI>Augurs,</HI> who were for &s;ome Ages the Engro&s;&s;ers of all the&s;e Delu&s;ions in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Augurs</HI> were a &s;ort of <HI>Roman</HI> Prie&s;ts, who pretended to foretell Events by Omens, by the chattering of Birds, howling of Dogs, and other uncouth Noi&s;es of any kind in the Air: They were
<PB N="206" REF="221">
erected into a Society, and formed in a College of Hall by the King's &s;pecial Order; the Number at fir&s;t was but three, one being taken from every <HI>Roman</HI> Tribe; and while they were thus few, the Dignity was very valuable, and it was highly e&s;teemed among even the <HI>Patricii</HI> and Nobility. <HI>Servius Tullius</HI> encreas'd their Number to Four, and cau&s;ed them to be taken only from the Nobility: Afterwards <HI>Quintus</HI> and <HI>Caeneus Agellinus</HI> obtained that Five more &s;hould be added to their Number, and &s;hould be cho&s;en out of the <HI>Plebeii</HI> or Common People. So ambitious were the <HI>Romans</HI> of this Diabolical Preferment, and &s;o much Honour had the <HI>Devil</HI>'s immediate Servants in the World; nay, upon this Increa&s;e of their Number to Nine, the Government was &s;o re&s;olute again&s;t lowering the Price of that Reverence and E&s;teem they had among the People, that they pa&s;&s;ed a Decree a|gain&s;t encrea&s;ing their Number any more.</P>
<P>However <HI>Sylla,</HI> one of the mo&s;t bloody and cruel Tyrants of his Time, that he might, accord|ing to Cu&s;tom, join his Care of Religion to his Thir&s;t of Blood, added &s;ix more; &s;o that now their Number was fifteen. The elde&s;t, whether in Years of longe&s;t &s;tanding in Order, (I am not po&s;itive which) was made Father or Pre&s;ident of the College, and had the immediate Direction of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Their Privileges, like their In&s;titution, were ex|orbitant; for they were never to be depo&s;ed or ex|pelled, no not for any Crime how great &s;oever, nor their Places filled up by another.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> Crime did not render the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Agents &s;candalous in their Profe&s;&s;ion, but rather the wickeder they were, the fitter for the Prie&s;t|hood or Augurate. How far the &s;ame Max|im may hold in &s;ome of the &s;acred Order in the World at this time, if I was of their Number, I &s;hould not vote to have it examined.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="222">And now for the Ceremonies of the Augurs Trade; for we mu&s;t note, that the Art Magick had always abundance of dark and uncouth U&s;ages attending it, as it has to this Day; rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI> was not done with a Whi&s;tle, like calling a Dog; or with a Beck of the Head or Hand, as we beckon to Servants when we call them &s;ilently to come near us; the <HI>Devil</HI> knew very well that his Affair mu&s;t be clothed with Ceremony, or it would not take with the World, or at lea&s;t would not hold long in it.</P>
<P>The Pagan Rites were indeed loaded with Bur|then&s;ome Ceremonies; all the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Wor&s;hip was filled with Conjurings and Mutterings, &s;trange Ge|&s;tures, Agitations, Ec&s;ta&s;ies, and I know not how many Di&s;tortings of the Limbs and Countenances, wild Practices and frightful Noi&s;es, that filled the People with Terror, and with a kind of awful Horrour at the Maje&s;ty of their Gods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Augurs</HI> Ob&s;ervations were attended with a great Variety of tho&s;e things, as the <HI>Apparatus</HI> to their Vi&s;ions, or whatever el&s;e they were to be called. The Augur fir&s;t placed him&s;elf upon a high Tower like one of our Ob&s;ervatories, and perhaps the Tower erected upon a high Hill, as upon the <HI>Mons Palatinus</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI>: Here he &s;eated him&s;elf in the cleare&s;t Day, or in a Star-light Night, to ob|&s;erve what came by him, or in his Sight, by Day, or what he might hear or &s;ee by Night.</P>
<P>He held in his Hand a <HI>Lituus,</HI> that is, a crooked Staff, with which he u&s;ed a great many wild Ge|&s;tures and Motions; and he had on, his grave <HI>Laena,</HI> that is, his South&s;aying Gown or Mantle: He placed him&s;elf always with his Face to the Ea&s;t, and at his fir&s;t fixing his Station he utter'd cer|tain Sentences and exotic barbarous Words, which none knew the Meaning of but the <HI>Devil</HI> and him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="223">Being thus &s;eated and fix'd, as I have &s;aid, he quarters out the Heavens, or Hemi&s;phere rather, into four Parts or Regions, each Quarter having before|hand &s;uch and &s;uch Predictions a&s;&s;ign'd to it: If it was Day, then he was to mark every Bird that ro&s;e up, or came flying by, or towards him; which of the &s;aid four Quarters he fir&s;t appear'd in, and then killing his Sacrifices, and muttering over cer|tain Sentences, joyning &s;ome petitionary Speeches to &s;uch or &s;uch a Deity, or Daemon rather, (which Speeches were call'd <HI>Effata</HI>) he then proceeded to Divination.</P>
<P>If it was in the Night, he ob&s;erv'd in the like manner any fiery Meteor, any flying or &s;hooting Fires, any &s;udden Vapour, (as the Nights are full of &s;uch things,) or any Cloud eclip&s;ing the Light of any particular Planet or Star of the fir&s;t Magni|tude; and then he proceeded in the &s;ame manner, only with &s;ome particular Words and Mutterings, as regarded the &s;everal Appearances re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>In the Night, it was &s;aid, they had the Company of &s;everal Spirits a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, and communica|ting to them the Knowledge of the Things they de|&s;ir'd. Their Divinations were arbitrary and po&s;i|tive, nor dur&s;t any Man ask or enquire of them the Rea&s;on of what they predicted, or how they came to know that it would or &s;hould be &s;o and &s;o. A Provi&s;ion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, very prudent in the Prie&s;ts, and which, as the ca&s;e has &s;tood with &s;ome of them, would be very much to their Convenience to this Day, as I &s;hall &s;how in its Place.</P>
<P>By this taking &s;uch a kind of State upon them, they politickly pre&s;erv'd the Reverence and E&s;teem of their Order, and imprinted a kind of Awe in the Minds of the People, concerning not the Holine&s;s of their Per&s;ons only, (tho' that went a great way,) but concerning the divine My&s;teries, as they were call'd, which were put into their Hands; and they
<PB N="209" REF="224">
were look'd upon as Per&s;ons to whom the Gods had committed the mo&s;t &s;ecret Things that were otherwi&s;e known only to them&s;elves, and were com|municated to the <HI>Augurs,</HI> Favourites of the Gods, for the good of Mankind.</P>
<P>A Learned Author, &s;peaking of this My&s;tery of South&s;aying, &s;ays, it came fir&s;t from the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> who taught it to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> of whom <HI>Amphiaraus</HI> was an eminent Proficient; but he mentions no|thing of who taught it the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> in which I believe my Account is the mo&s;t authentick; name|ly, that the <HI>Devil</HI> taught it to the <HI>Arab</HI> I have mention'd, or to &s;ome other, if any was before him; that the&s;e gave it to the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and <HI>Chal|deans,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> much about the &s;ame time; and that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> taught it the <HI>Greeks</HI>; their Prince <HI>Cadmus</HI> being an eminent South&s;ayer: and &s;o you &s;ee its ble&s;&s;ed Original.</P>
<P>In a word, as it is a particular Familiarity with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and depends entirely upon his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o no body can contend that he was not the fir&s;t Introducer of it as an Art; &s;ince, as I ob&s;erved, he might ea&s;ily begin a Corre&s;pondence with Man; but it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible that Men &s;hould be|gin a Corre&s;pondence with him; or know where to find him, and how to call him to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, whatever the Occa&s;ion might be, without his Di|rection, A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>As to the Introducing it from one Nation to a|nother, it may indeed be &s;omething difficult to a&s;&s;ign the manner; But as to the meer divining upon the flying of Birds, upon Noi&s;es, and Appearances in the Air, the Chattering of Pyes, the Croak|ing of Frogs and Ravens, and the like, I take much of that to be meer Juggle and Legerdemain of the Prie&s;ts and Augurs; and they have carry'd on the juggling Trade to a great Perfection in the &s;ame

<P>But now for a downright Conver&s;e with the <HI>De|vil,</HI> I don't under&s;tand that Satan ever ty'd him&s;elf down by Articles, that not only &s;uch and &s;uch a Man as my <HI>Arab,</HI> or <HI>Ali Albrahazen,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken, &s;hould be able to call him up when they pleas'd, by &s;uch and &s;uch Forms, Ceremonies, Voices and Sounds; but that to whom&s;oever they &s;hould communicate the &s;ame Tokens, or Watch|words, they &s;hould have the &s;ame Power, and that the very Words &s;hould call him or his Agents up to an Appearance, whoever made u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>This would have been to have the <HI>Devil</HI> bind him&s;elf Prentice to them and their Heirs for ever; and to have chain'd him&s;elf down, Gally&s;lave like, to the &s;ound of the Words, which I take to be quite wide of the Ca&s;e; nor would it &s;erve his De&s;igns, for the <HI>Devil</HI> loves to know his Agents, and not be at the call of every Boy, becau&s;e perhaps his Grand|mother told him the Words which &s;he u&s;ed to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> with, or becau&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> and &s;he had a|greed upon the Matter. But no doubt Satan, who is certainly the Author of all this kind of Magick, and which therefore and for that very Rea&s;on is call'd by his Name, <HI>Diabolick</HI>; I &s;ay, no doubt, as he is the only Teacher of the Art, &s;o he teaches it immediately by him&s;elf; that is, he make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Men <HI>Magicians,</HI> and Wizards, and makes old Wo|men Witches (ay and young too) by an immediate Conver&s;e and Contract with them only, and between them and him&s;elf.

<PB N="211" REF="226">
of every Nation mu&s;t learn the &s;ame Lan|guage; but on the contrary, as the <HI>Devil</HI> talks all Languages when he plea&s;es, &s;o he talks to every one of his Di&s;ciples in their own Mother Tongue, and directs them to do the &s;ame to him; &s;o that a <HI>Roman</HI> Wizard calls him up in <HI>Latin</HI>; a <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> Conjurer in <HI>Italian</HI>; a <HI>High German</HI> Doctor makes his Circles, and ca&s;ts his Figures, and talks Ma|gick to him in the &s;uitable Tongue call'd <HI>High Dutch</HI>; the &s;econd-&s;ighted <HI>Highlander</HI> in <HI>Irs,</HI> and the <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Lady in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>So propitious, &s;o civil, &s;o well-manner'd is Satan to all his Drudges and Devotees, that he, to put them to as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible, &s;toops to hear|ken to their Summons, as they think fit to expre&s;s them&s;elves in their own, or any Language. Nay, tho' the <HI>Magicians</HI> &s;ometimes form a Cant of their own, by which they amu&s;e their Clients, yet their familiar Friend takes it in good part, and on|ver&s;es with them in their own way.</P>
<P>Even the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> Pawaw with him in the Language of the mo&s;t Northern <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Ba|nians</HI> in the Language of the Ea&s;t <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> of <HI>Amboyna</HI> in the Language of the <HI>Celebes</HI> and <HI>Mo|luccos,</HI> and the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in that of <HI>Grand Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Magicians</HI> &s;eem to act in this Part, as if the <HI>Devil</HI> conde&s;cended to them, not they to him; but then this makes it evident, that he conver&s;es Per|&s;onally with them all, that he makes his Bar|gains and Agreements with them always &s;eparately, in all Places, and in all Languages; whereas, if he gave them a general Commi&s;&s;ion to empower others to divine, inchant, and rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> or evil Spirits, they mu&s;t all under&s;tand one univer&s;al Language.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the Matter is this; the <HI>Devil,</HI> as a Learned Author &s;ays, has three ways by which he carries on his Kingdom in the World, and by
<PB N="212" REF="227">
which he works all his Wonders, which amu&s;e and deceive them.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By moving the Affections and Thoughts of Men, whether &s;leeping or waking; and this, as it re&s;pects his cau&s;ing them to dream on any Occa&s;ion as he thinks fit, is one very con&s;iderable Branch of his Power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By his exqui&s;ite Knowledge of Nature, by which he turns the Cau&s;es of things to his own Purpo&s;es, and often brings to pa&s;s &s;uch Events as &s;uit with his particular Occa&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By Illu&s;ion and Fraud, impo&s;ing upon the Sen&s;es, binding and blinding the Under&s;tanding and the Eyes, both of the Body and of the Minds of willingly-deceiv'd Men.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> And I may add a fourth, which perhaps he was not acquainted with in former times; namely, by familiar Agreement, Compact and Contract with the Bright Men of the Times, who he brings over to conver&s;e and corre|&s;pond with him, and who he acts by, and allows them to play their Game and his own together; and this is Magick.</P>
<P>Having then e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Corre&s;pondence with Man, we are not to wonder if, to gratify his new Corre&s;pondents, he empowers them to act abun|dance of &s;trange and unaccountable things in the World, that they may by that means obtain a Re|putation of being wi&s;er and craftier than their Neighbours, and may al&s;o be admir'd and e&s;teem'd fir&s;t, and con&s;equently believ'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wonders they work by his immediate Hand, by his Power and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as well as Di|rection; and this I call <HI>Magick,</HI> and it is &s;o in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>To this he &s;ubjoins a Power, as it may be call'd, over him&s;elf; authorizing the <HI>Magicians</HI> or Con|jurers
<PB N="213" REF="228">
to &s;ummon him in to their Aid whenever they have Occa&s;ion for him, to demand his Pre|&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance whenever they plea&s;e. It was &s;aid of <HI>Hamed</HI> an <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Sorcerer, that he had the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o at his Command, that if he did but draw a Circle upon the Ground, and &s;tamp with his Foot in the middle of it, the <HI>Devil</HI> would ap|pear, and bring as many Devils with him, as the <HI>Magician</HI> &s;tampt &s;everal times on the Ground; and that upon their &s;o appearing, he could again &s;end them of &s;uch Errands, and for the Di&s;patch of &s;uch Bu|&s;ine&s;s as he requir'd; whether to do good or evil, to bring on Mi&s;chief, or to prevent Mi&s;chief, as he that &s;o call'd him up pleas'd to direct; but I do not vouch the Truth of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Complai&s;ance in this Particular, nor &s;ee the Rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Magicians</HI> in tho&s;e ancient Days had &s;uch Influence upon him, 'tis undoubtedly true that they did him great and &s;ignal Services, for, and by it; or el&s;e Satan, who does not u&s;e to di&s;pence his Fa|vours <HI>gratis,</HI> mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;ecret View in it, which they or we have not yet di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>This great U&s;e which the <HI>Devil</HI> makes of <HI>Magicians</HI> and Conjurers, is a certain Di&s;covery that he is con|fin'd by a &s;uperior Hand in his Workings, and that he can only act by Stratagem, by Cunning, and Craft, not by Force and Power.</P>
<P>It is reported of a Sorcerer in <HI>Rome,</HI> that he could call for Lightning and Thunder whenever he plea&s;ed, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> would produce it for him; but that calling him up once to procure Thunder, that &s;hould burn a Hou&s;e, and do great Mi&s;chief, to gratifie the wicked De&s;ign of the Conjurer; he told him No, he could not gratifie his Revenge &s;o far, at lea&s;t not at that time; and that the &s;ame Sorcerer did at la&s;t confe&s;s, that the Spirit which he convers'd with, could &s;how his Power

many ways in a miraculous manner, but could not do any Mi&s;chief by it.</P>
<P>It may be true, and no doubt is &s;o, that the <HI>Ma|gicians,</HI> were they fully empower'd, and at Liberty, would really do more Mi&s;chief than the <HI>Devil</HI> him|&s;elf, had he the &s;ame Power; not that their Malice can be greater, but their Policy is certainly le&s;s; and as they do not &s;ee &s;o far before them as he does, &s;o they do not always &s;ee into the Rea&s;on of things, and whether it would be for the common Intere&s;t or no: for Example; were the <HI>Devil</HI> empower'd to fire Hou&s;es, de&s;troy Families, lay wa&s;te King|doms, he might encline to do it; but his Pru|dentials and Politicks might &s;ometimes tell him, that it would be more for his Intere&s;t to let it a|lone; and &s;o the <HI>Magicians</HI> likewi&s;e find it, I &s;ay, for their common Intere&s;t, to act by Craft and Subtilty as their Ma&s;ter the <HI>Devil</HI> has done before them, rather than by open Rage and Fury; I mean for their common Intere&s;t as <HI>Magicians.</HI> The <HI>Devil,</HI> could without doubt, in the ordinary Exerci&s;e of his Power as a Spirit, burn, kill, de&s;troy, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e put an end to God's Creation: But this would not an&s;wer his End; he knows his Maker is his Go|vernour, and could if he pleas'd puni&s;h him imme|diately, even as he expre&s;&s;es it in the Scripture, <HI>be|fore his time:</HI> And he knows likewi&s;e, that when he had de&s;troy'd, and made havock of Mankind, God could, with the Breath of his Mouth, form a new Species, and that &s;uch a Kind as he &s;hould have no Power over; and therefore 'tis not in &s;hort the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Intere&s;t to make that Spoil in the World, which as an Angel, as a powerful Spirit, he might do; and e&s;pecially if we &s;uppo&s;e him not to be chain'd and fetter'd down to &s;uperior Limitations, which however we know to our infinite Satisfa|ction that he is.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="230">In a word, the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s, and all his Aim, is not to de&s;troy, but to damn Mankind; not to cut him off, and put his Maker to the trouble of a new Creation, but to make him a Rebel, like him&s;elf; and even this he is fain to bring to pa&s;s by Subtilty and Art, making u&s;e of Man again&s;t Man, arming Fle&s;h again&s;t Spirit, and &s;etting Nature in Defiance of the God of Nature; and this by &s;e|cretly corre&s;ponding with &s;ome of the wor&s;t and vile&s;t abandon'd Wretches that he can find; in|&s;tructing them, and teaching them his own Methods, and &s;o making them Traytors to their own Kind; drawing them in to engage with him in ruining the Souls and Bodies of others, and concerting Mea|&s;ures with the&s;e corrupted In&s;truments, who&s;e Principles he has fir&s;t debauch'd, that they may act and do for him, and in his Name, all the Mi&s;chief which he finds it is not for his Purpo&s;e to do him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>While he thus lies behind the Curtain him&s;elf, and is not &s;een, or at lea&s;t not publickly, he cor|re&s;ponds mo&s;t punctually with the&s;e Agents, em|powering and directing them by a great variety of helli&s;h Arts and Contrivances to work Wonders, amu&s;e and impo&s;e upon Mankind, and carry on all his Affairs for him. And this is that we call the Black Art, and &s;o I am come back to my Text.</P>
<P>If it be true that the <HI>Devil</HI> is the Prince of the Air, then he can form Tempe&s;ts in it, can poi&s;on and infect it &s;o, as that all Creatures, Humane as well as &s;en&s;itive and vegetable, &s;hould peri&s;h in it; But as he is yet a Prince under Limitations and Re|&s;trictions, &s;o he can exert no more Power than he has; and when his humane Agents, who are there|in wor&s;e Devils than him&s;elf, would be for Con|flagrations, and general De&s;truction; He wi&s;ely, or rather cunningly, puts them off, and diverts them, without telling them, or giving them room to
<PB N="216" REF="231">
think, that he really has not Power him&s;elf to en|able them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to clo&s;e this Article of the <HI>Magi|cians</HI> Power being limited, without an agree|able Reflection upon the modern Furies of our Age, your Party Leaders, and Politick Scheme-Makers; what merry work they would make in the World, if the <HI>Devil,</HI> their Head Engineer, was not limited, and not in Condition to tru&s;t them with the Power of doing Mi&s;chief as they de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Sen&s;e of this Limitation in the Pow|er of their chief Corre&s;pondent is one Rea&s;on, that however &s;tudious they are to do Mi&s;chief, yet they have not &s;o much &s;tudied the Diabolical Art as they would otherwi&s;e have done; in a word, they are not compleat <HI>Magicians,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;ee the Black Art is not wicked enough for them, and they can|not obtain a Power by it to out-&s;in the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>But I come back to the Art it &s;elf. The Arti&s;ts are certainly very helpful to the <HI>Devil,</HI> as well as the <HI>Devil</HI> to them: For as he is oblig'd to work by Stratagem, not by Force, all his Cunning is em|ploy'd to carry on his Kingdom and Government in the World; and this brings me to the Rea&s;on why the <HI>Devil</HI> does not care to act in Per&s;on, in mo&s;t ca&s;es of his Admini&s;tration; but to employ tho&s;e People, whom we call <HI>Magicians,</HI> that they may act with his full Directions, and tho' with Art, yet with Power al&s;o &s;ufficient to &s;tand his Ground again&s;t all humane Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Under the Cover of the&s;e Agents he acts with infinite Succe&s;s, by their Influence he carries on all his Affairs, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Kingdom and Dominion, in which it is not for want of Im|pudence if he does not rival or indeed dethrone his Maker. By his &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with them it is that he fills the World with &s;ham Won|ders, and fal&s;e Stories, which being detected and
<PB N="217" REF="232">
expo&s;ed, reflects upon the <HI>Magicians,</HI> not upon the <HI>Devil</HI>; neither indeed ought it to affect him, for that it is not for want of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance if any of them mi&s;carry, but from their expecting more from him than it is fit he &s;hould grant, or than perhaps it is in his Power to grant. No wonder then he is &s;o officious, and &s;o willing, that he runs and goes, and dances Attendance upon a &s;et of ignorant <HI>Ma|gicians</HI>; I &s;ay ignorant, except only as he in&s;tructs them; 'tis evidently, becau&s;e he makes his Advan|tage of them, and they act for his Account.</P>
<P>'Tis then apparent, that the <HI>Magicians</HI> are In&s;truments by which the <HI>Devil</HI> carries on his Po|litick Affairs in the World. It is time then, in the next Place, to enquire in what manner they per|form it, and from what Principles they act; and then we &s;hall come to &s;ome Hi&s;torical Account of their merry Proceedings in the World.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Black Art</HI> it &s;elf; what it really is, why there are &s;everal differing Practices of it in the &s;everal Parts of the World, and what tho&s;e Practices are; as al&s;o, what is contained in it in General.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Have all along, till now, &s;poken of the general Corre&s;pondence of the <HI>Devil</HI> with Mankind, under the Head of <HI>Diabolick Magick,</HI> as a meer Intimacy only; I have repre&s;ented it as a Method which the <HI>Devil</HI> fir&s;t took, to form his Intere&s;t and Acquaintance with Mankind, when he was drown'd out of his Kingdom in the old World by the Flood.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="234">'Tis too certain that the <HI>Devil</HI> acted by this Me|thod at fir&s;t, for the Propagation of his own De|&s;igns only, and to &s;et on foot a new Admini&s;trati|on of his Affairs; it being for many Rea&s;ons not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to act openly and barefacedly in the World as a <HI>Devil</HI>; but now 'tis al&s;o as apparent, that after the <HI>Devil</HI> had thus e&s;tabli&s;hed a Corre|&s;pondence, he &s;oon found Man as forward as him|&s;elf, as willing to embark with him and engage, as he could de&s;ire; nay &s;o forward in the new Trade, &s;o eager for Mi&s;chief, &s;o glad of being ve|&s;ted with Power (tho' Infernal) to do it, and to gratify tho&s;e vile&s;t of his Pa&s;&s;ions, Envy, Revenge, Malice and Strife, that the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, as is ob|&s;erved in the la&s;t Chapter, is forced to re&s;train him, and gently to divert his Thoughts to &s;ome le&s;s vi|olent and le&s;s de&s;tructive Methods; not being wil|ling, and &s;ometimes indeed not being able, to act &s;o much the <HI>Devil</HI> as the&s;e new Hell-fire Agents would have him at it.</P>
<P>The Corre&s;pondence being thus &s;ettled between the <HI>Devil</HI> and the Magician, and the Treaties be|tween them &s;igned, ratified, and exchanged in Form, the In&s;trument (Man) is immediately furni&s;hed by the Employer (Satan) with all nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tions for his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and is compleatly qualify'd for an Infernal Mountebank; and &s;o he falls to his Juggling-box and to &s;hewing his Tricks, his Pawaw|ing and Conjuring, and in a word, exerci&s;ing his new Acquirements and Helli&s;h Talents upon Man|kind; and this we call, and that with a great Pro|priety of Speech, the BLACK ART.</P>
<P>The brief Definition of what we call the <HI>Black Art,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as I would have it be under|&s;tood in the re&s;t of my Di&s;cour&s;e, is, that it is a new general Term for all the Branches of that Corre&s;pondence which Mankind has maintained, or does, or can carry on, between him&s;elf and the
<PB N="220" REF="235">
<HI>Devil,</HI> between this and the Infernal World; com|pri&s;ing all the eight Particulars which I mentioned before, as they are taken from the Prohibition of them, and the Declaration again&s;t them in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> viz.

</LIST></P>
<P>The Practice of the&s;e, or of any of them, or of all of them, is what we are to under&s;tand by this ge|neral Term the <HI>Black Art</HI>; and as the&s;e &s;everal Parts are expre&s;s'd after a differing manner, and per|haps practis'd in a differing Form in &s;everal and re|mote Parts of the World, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give a brief De&s;cription of them one by one; that &s;o when we name them apart, I may yet be right|ly under&s;tood, and may need no more Digre&s;&s;ions for Explanation of Terms as I go on.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Divining.</HI> A Diviner I under&s;tand to be the &s;ame as was antienly called a <HI>South&s;ayer</HI>; this is ex|pre&s;ly confirm'd in Scripture, if you will take its Authority for any thing, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi.16. <HI>A certain Dam&s;el po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Spirit of</HI> Divination <HI>met us, who brought her Ma&s;ter great Gain by</HI> South&s;aying: <HI>So that</HI> Divination <HI>and</HI> South&s;aying <HI>is the &s;ame thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> Ob&s;erve that this Divination is here called a Spirit, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Devil,</HI> or a <HI>Devil</HI>; and he was really in her, for 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Paul</HI> ca&s;t him out of her.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="236">This South&s;aying al&s;o, as we are to under&s;tand it, contained all tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Pieces of low-priz'd Art, called, telling Fortunes, re&s;olving Difficulties, find|ing out and di&s;covering &s;ecret things; and perhaps all the juggling Part practi&s;ed at this time; and that without any Corre&s;pondence with the Spirit <HI>Python</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI> ca&s;t out, or any other Spirit but that of Fraud and Legerdemain, which the Divining or South&s;aying is only made a Cover to.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ob&s;ervers of Times.</HI> The&s;e I take to be &s;ome, who, by Corre&s;pondence with an evil Spirit, de|clared &s;uch and &s;uch Days or Times to have a particular Fatality, &s;o that no Bu&s;ine&s;s which was undertaken on that Day could pro&s;per; and this Part of the Black Art may take in &s;uch as carrying on the Study of judicial A&s;trology to the extreme, and to the Gates of Hell, a&s;cribe Events of Things to the Government and Influence of the Stars, and that Influence to be &s;o or &s;o directed for Good or Evil, according to the particular Po&s;ition, Oppo&s;i|tion, Conjunction or Situation of tho&s;e Stars or Planets in differing Hou&s;es; as if the&s;e could be the Directors of the Fate of Per&s;ons, Families and Na|tions; and that the Events of things were directed by them, and by the Sea&s;ons and Times of their Stations here or there in the Cour&s;e of their ordi|nary Motion, whether direct or retrogade: In a word, the Practice of judicial A&s;trology, tho' not a dealing with, or by the Help of the <HI>Devil,</HI> is condemn'd here, as being a plain robbing Divine Providence of its known Glory, in directing and di&s;|po&s;ing both Cau&s;es and Events in all things relating to the Government of Mankind, or indeed of the whole World, and a&s;cribing that to the poor innocent unconcerned Stars or Planets which is &s;ingly in the Di&s;po&s;ition of him that made them. The Stars and Planets are no intelligent Beings; they have indeed a vegetative or active Life, but as to
<PB N="222" REF="237">
Knowledge or Acquaintance of or with human Af|fairs they are entirely lifele&s;s Bodies, utterly incapable of influencing or directing any thing, or of any Motion or Action, other than by the Direction of the &s;ame Power and Providence which made and guides them in common with the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>U&s;ing Inchantments.</HI> The&s;e are variou&s;ly de|&s;crib'd by the Ancients; but to explain it by our modern Terms of Art, this is what we call Con|juring; and this is certainly performed by the im|mediate Agency and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the evil Spirit, when the Magician u&s;ing the&s;e Inchantments, works by the &s;ecret Aid of the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ome won|derful thing, &s;o as to &s;urpri&s;e the Beholders, and make them think the Operator is ve&s;ted with &s;u|pernatural Power, and con&s;equently is &s;ome ex|traordinary Man. Thus when St. <HI>Paul</HI> healed the lame Man at <HI>Ly&s;tra,</HI> the People, &s;urpri&s;ed with the Miracle, cry'd out pre&s;ently, <HI>The Gods are come down to us in the Likene&s;s of Men.</HI> Thus the Ma|gicians in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Court made Frogs, turn'd the Water into Blood, and the Rods into Serpents by their Inchantments, that is to &s;ay, by the immedi|ate Hand of the <HI>Devil</HI>; who was permitted, it &s;eems, to increa&s;e the Plagues of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> doing Mi&s;|chief being his particular Talent: But I do not read that whenever <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> denounc'd any of tho&s;e Plagues, the Magicians could &s;top or prevent them; if they could have done that indeed, they had been worth Notice, but it was quite otherwi&s;e; for, le&s;t they &s;hould boa&s;t too much of their Power, they were re&s;train|ed, and not able to make Lice, tho' they had made Frogs and Serpents; but they were obliged to acknowledge in publick, that they were unable to do it, that it was the Finger of God, and that he had put a &s;top to their Inchantments; in a word, it made them acknowledge that, according to an
<PB N="223" REF="238">
old Proverb which, for ought I know, is derived from thence, <HI>GOD is above the Devil.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Witchcraft.</HI> This is indeed the blacke&s;t part of the Black Art it &s;elf: I need not de&s;cribe it any farther than this, that it is a Power received im|mediately from the <HI>Devil</HI> to do Mi&s;chief; to gratify Rage, Envy, Malice, Revenge, and the vile&s;t Pa&s;|&s;ions of Men, giving it into their Hands to be|witch Men, Cattle, Places and Things; to burn and de&s;troy, tho' limited, as hinted before in many Particulars; the Effects of this Witchcraft we of|ten &s;ee, and &s;hall &s;ay more to it in its Place.</P>
<P>This includes Per&s;ons being immediately agi|tated by an evil Spirit, carried often violently into the Air by the Help of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and being able to carry away others in the Air al&s;o; and not to in&s;i&s;t upon all the improbable things &s;aid of them, and &s;aid to be done by them; yet that the <HI>Devil</HI> certainly plays his Pranks by tho&s;e Tools &s;ometimes in a mo&s;t extravagant manner, I mu&s;t grant.

<P>In this Article of Witchcraft is included what we call an Evil Tongue, an evil Eye, Cur&s;ing, Bla&s;ting, Bewitching, and abundance of Helli&s;h things which tho&s;e Creatures are permitted to practi&s;e, to the Hurt of tho&s;e that they point their Malice again&s;t.</P>

<P>Thus we read that King <HI>Mena&s;&s;es</HI> dealt with the <HI>Devil</HI>; the Text &s;ays expre&s;ly, <HI>he u&s;ed Witchcraft and Inchantments, and dealt with a familiar Spirit.</HI> And who could doubt it, from what followed? nothing but a Man abandoned to Hell, and that had the <HI>Devil</HI> at his Elbow, could have been prevailed with to do what he did, which at that time was the mo&s;t dangerous piece of Impudence that ever had been heard of, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;et a carved Image in the very Temple, the Hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Wizards.</HI> This &s;ome take to be nothing but what they call a Man Witch; but in the Practice it hath been carried farther, namely, to be one that con&s;ults with the <HI>Devil,</HI> to give An&s;wers to difficult Que&s;tions, to reveal and di&s;cover Con&s;piracies, and to govern the greater things of Life; as to bla&s;t or &s;ucceed the Enterprizes of Princes and People; to tell and foretell the Succe&s;s of &s;uch and &s;uch Un|dertakings; and even to influence the Undertakers. Such a one as this was <HI>Baalim,</HI> who being fam'd for a Wizard, was &s;ent for a long way by the King of <HI>Moab</HI> to cur&s;e the Camp and Army of the <HI>He|brews.</HI></P>
<P>The Northern Word u&s;ed in our own Country for this Kind is a <HI>Warlock,</HI> the antient Import of which was one that could give good or bad Speed to any Undertaking, or at lea&s;t could foretell whe|ther the thing enquired about &s;hould &s;ucceed or no.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="240">We have abundance of merry Tales &s;catter'd a|broad in the Oral Tradition of antient times, and among tho&s;e antient things called <HI>Old Women,</HI> con|cerning Wizards: how the Kings and Princes u&s;ed to con&s;ult with them, before they undertook any great Enterprize: They tell you in the North; how an old Wizard warned King <HI>James</HI> IV of <HI>Scotland</HI> who was killed at <HI>Flodden Field,</HI> not to pa&s;s the <HI>Tweed</HI> with his Army, but encamp on the Nor|thern Bank of the River, and that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Water of <HI>Tweed</HI> to attack him, he &s;hould certainly defeat and overthrow them; but that if he fought on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, he &s;hould lo&s;e both his Army and his Life; which accordingly hap|pen'd.

<P>It is true the&s;e blacke&s;t of the <HI>Black-Art Men</HI> have a great many other things in their Practice, be&s;ides that of brokering for the <HI>Devil</HI>; they were u&s;ed to rai&s;e Storms, Whirlwinds, and Hurricanes, by which they made them&s;elves very terrible to the People, as if it was in their Power to do all the mi&s;chievous things in the World: By this they brought in their Cu&s;tomers, for the People u&s;ually brib'd them, as the <HI>Indians</HI> wor&s;hip the <HI>Devil</HI> that he may do them no Harm. The &s;trong Opinion the common People had of the&s;e Men in time pa&s;t was &s;uch, that they would go to them for Rain in Drought, and for fair Weather in Harve&s;t, for Abatement of Floods, and for protecting their Cattle in Lightning and Thunder.</P>
<P>To &s;um them up all, the Diviner and South&s;ayer, the judicial A&s;trologer and Conjurer, the Inchanter and Charmer, the Witch and the Wizard, the Ne|cromancer and Dealer with a Familiar Spirit all put together and practi&s;ed in their fulle&s;t Extent, make up this <HI>One Black Art</HI> which I am &s;peaking of, in its Perfection; and in this Sen&s;e I am to be under|&s;tood in the following Part of this Work.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Modern Magick, or the Black Art as now in its Practice and Perfection.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE antient Magick having by a long Succe&s;&s;ion of Art and Time been handed down to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and from them to the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> we cannot but acknowledge that they went a great way to the improving it, for they mingled the <HI>Black Art</HI> &s;o entirely among their religious Wor&s;hip that it is not to this day po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the Rites and Ceremonies of their Gods, and the Inchantments and Charms, Conju|rations and Divinations immediately directed by the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="244">I have mentioned &s;omething of this already in their <HI>Augurs,</HI> and the &s;everal In&s;titutions of <HI>Romu|lus, Numa Pompilius,</HI> and others; but nothing &s;o effectually di&s;cover'd the <HI>Black Art</HI> to be blended with their Religious Rites, and the Craft of the <HI>Devil</HI> with the Wor&s;hip of their Gods, as the &s;et|ting up <HI>Oracles,</HI> giving Re&s;pon&s;es, and &s;olving Doubts, as if by Enquiry of the Gods; whereas in|deed it was all managed by the Craft of the <HI>De|vil,</HI> and the Agency of tho&s;e &s;olemn Knaves the Prie&s;ts; and this I call Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Magick.</P>
<P>There was not a little Knavery in the &s;etting up the Augurs, in the Divinations and Predictions from the flying and chattering of Birds; and be|fore that, in the Prie&s;ts poring upon the Intrails of the Bea&s;ts &s;acrificed to their Gods: Here this Art went &s;uch a length, that the Truth is, the Devil &s;aw him&s;elf outdone by the Prie&s;ts, and the Witchcraft of Super&s;tition went beyond all that Satan him&s;elf ever pretended to in the fir&s;t In|&s;titution: So far did the crafty and avaritious Prie&s;ts engro&s;s the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s, that they really &s;eem'd to take the very Trade out of his Hand, or as we &s;ay of an invading Trade&s;man that &s;ets up under his Ma&s;ter's No&s;e, <HI>he takes the Bread out of his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> were the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious of all the <HI>Devil</HI>-Wor&s;hippers in the World, wor&s;e than the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> from whom they borrowed all the Fundamentals of their Idolatry, and far wor&s;e than the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were afterwards their Scholars: Image and Idol Wor&s;hip were E&s;&s;entials in all their Temples, which the <HI>Romans</HI> at fir&s;t re|jected with Di&s;dain; even <HI>Numa Pompilius,</HI> the mo&s;t devout and &s;uper&s;titious of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> de&s;pis'd it; and many of the mo&s;t learned of the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors exclaim again&s;t it as ab&s;urd and ridiculous; however they came into it afterwards al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="245">But the <HI>Greeks,</HI> I &s;ay, from their particular Love to Super&s;tition, were the fir&s;t that wor&s;hipped the Images of their Gods: thus you read of the <HI>Ephe|&s;ians</HI> having the Image of <HI>Jupiter</HI> which came down from Heaven; in like manner they had particular Images in every Temple, and Temples almo&s;t in every Corner; and being the fitte&s;t People to be thus impo&s;ed upon and deluded, the Prie&s;ts who were equally &s;ubtle there as in other Places, invented (or the Devil directed them to) that gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all Cheats, the Oracles of their Gods; to who&s;e Temples they con&s;tantly repair'd for An&s;wers in the mo&s;t difficult and doubtful Ca&s;es; and the <HI>Romans</HI> took it from them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Oracles were indeed the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ma&s;ter|piece, for here the Prie&s;ts and him&s;elf juggled to|gether in &s;o notorious a manner, that no Contri|vance for putting a publick Cheat upon the World ever met with the like Succe&s;s: The <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the Prie&s;ts gave An&s;wers in the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, doubtful and ambiguous Terms imaginable, &s;o that they frequently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the People with a Belief of the Things predicted being come to pa&s;s; where|as it was all owing to the Double Entendre of the An&s;wers, which left things to be under&s;tood any way the Prie&s;ts thought fit, and left the Prie&s;ts room to &s;ugge&s;t a Corre&s;pondence between the O|racle and the Event, when indeed there was no manner of Similitude, no Coherence, or any thing like it.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory gives &s;everal Examples of the ambiguous doubtful An&s;wers of the Oracles, and yet &s;o bigot|ted were the <HI>Greeks</HI> to their Notions of them, that on the Day of the great Battle at <HI>Plataea</HI> with the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> they would not give Battle, tho' the Ene|my was upon them, and began to trample down their Infantry with the Hor&s;e, till they knew the Will of the Gods, as they expre&s;s'd it, and had a
<PB N="231" REF="246">
full An&s;wer from the Oracle; the Soldiers &s;itting &s;till upon the Ground, and letting the Enemies cut them in Pieces. But as &s;oon as they had under&s;tood that the Oracle had given its An&s;wer, and that their Sacrifices for Victory were favourable, their Commanders a&s;&s;uring them that the Gods were propitious, and that they had a Promi&s;e of Victory, they immediately rous'd up from their Seats, form'd their Battalia or Phalanx, and fell on with &s;uch Fury, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the other <HI>Greeks</HI> that were confederate with them, were ut|terly overthrown, and cut in Pieces.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s, in order to &s;how the World how great the Powers of religious Infatuations were, and how far Mankind may be impos'd upon, to give a &s;hort Account of but that one Day's Ac|tion between the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army under their Ge|neral <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> and <HI>Mardonius</HI> Leader of the Army of <HI>Xerxes</HI> the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred thou&s;and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> the Flower of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s Army; and fifty thou&s;and <HI>Greeks; Thebans, Macedonians</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> Auxiliaries or Confederates with <HI>Xerxes.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of no more than forty thou&s;and <HI>Grecians,</HI> but old Soldiers, and well arm'd, commanded by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> to whom they had join'd indeed &s;eventy thou&s;and Auxiliar Militia, but the&s;e were only raw and unexperi|enc'd People; nor had they any Dependance on them for their Valour or Di&s;cipline, only for making Excur&s;ions, plundering, and the like.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The <HI>Greeks</HI> had &s;ent to enquire of the Oracle at <HI>Delphos,</HI> to know the Succe&s;s of the War, and were an&s;wer'd, that they &s;hould certainly have the Victory, provided they fought the Battel up|on <HI>Athenian Ground,</HI> or in the Plains of <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> and made their Prayers to &s;uch and &s;uch GODS, <HI>Demy Gods</HI> and NYMPHS, <HI>(Ex|cellent</HI>

<P>'While they were in this Unea&s;ine&s;s, the <HI>Pla|taeans,</HI> to &s;hew their good will, and encourage the Army, be&s;tow'd all the Lands which tho&s;e Temples and dedicated Places &s;tood on, and for a large Space round, by Deed of Gift on the <HI>Athenians,</HI> &s;o to cau&s;e them to fight on <HI>Athe|nian</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>'All things being thus clear'd up, and the Ar|mies ju&s;t ready to engage, the <HI>Grecian</HI> General cau&s;ed Sacrifices to the Gods for Victory to be brought to the head of the Troops; nor would the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;tir, or &s;trike a Stroke, till they were ended, and that the Prie&s;ts gave Signals of the Fortunate Omens. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army ad|vanc'd, the Hor&s;emen charg'd in upon the fore|mo&s;t Troops, the Arrows flew in Clouds, and many were &s;lain; but 'twas all one, the Soldiers &s;at upon the Ground, and would not &s;tir a Foot.</P>
<P>'But as &s;oon as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> had Notice that the Sacrifices were happily ended, and that he found tho&s;e Tokens in the Entrails of the Bea&s;ts, which the Super&s;tition of the Age e&s;teemed Fortunate, and Signals of Succe&s;s; he immediately caus'd the
<PB N="233" REF="248">
Army to rai&s;e a Shout, and gave the Signal of Battel: Upon which the Soldiers &s;uddenly ri&s;e up upon their Feet, with Acclamations, and re|ceiv'd the Charge of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> in &s;uch excel|lent Order, and with &s;uch undaunted Bravery, that notwith&s;tanding the Enemy came pouring in upon them with their Multitudes, expecting to bear all down before them, yet the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were repul&s;ed, and utterly overthrown, and <HI>Mardonius</HI> with above three hundred thou&s;and Men kill'd upon the Spot.</P></Q></P>
<P>What Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Magick was this! what Super|&s;tition, without ground! The Sacrifices would have gone on, tho' the Armies had engag'd; or if not, why were they not brought &s;ooner to the Place, and how in a few Moments more might the whole Army have been cut in Pieces without Re&s;i&s;tance, for want of the Ceremony of a timely Sacrifice? But &s;uch is the Power of Super&s;tition, and to &s;uch a degree of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Infatuation had the <HI>Devil,</HI> by the means of his In&s;truments the <HI>Magicians,</HI> brought Mankind.</P>
<P>This I take to be the Meridian of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Influence, and when the Magick Diabolical was at its greate&s;t Height. The <HI>Romans</HI> were &s;uper&s;titious enough, but not &s;o gro&s;ly given up: and yet the <HI>Gre|cians</HI> were a wi&s;e Nation; the <HI>Athenians</HI> were fam'd for Wi&s;dom and Knowledge; for Philo&s;ophy; Art and Science flouri&s;h'd among them to a degree be|yond all the re&s;t of the World. Nay they de&s;pis'd the Wi&s;dom of all the World in compari&s;on of their own; yet &s;wallow'd up with the Magick of Super&s;tition, they were in &s;hort bewitch'd by a religious Sorcery, and run into Super&s;tition to an exce&s;s equal to Madne&s;s and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> as I &s;aid above, follow'd them at the Hells; and tho' at fir&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t of their Leaders rejected the Image Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> nay

<P>In the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Times, the Minds of Men untaught, and without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Di|vine Illuminations, were ea&s;ily impos'd upon, given up to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, and to believe Lies; they were bigotted by the Prie&s;ts, and by their own Native Super&s;titions, and were ea&s;ily deluded to wor&s;hip any Gods, every bodies Gods, and even as above, <HI>Unknown Gods.</HI> Happy Ignorance! com|par'd to our Age, who by their Exce&s;s of Know|ledge and Sen&s;e are arriv'd to a degree of Liberty, from the Slavery and Bondage of all Religion; that e&s;teem them&s;elves wi&s;e, in having found out a new Happine&s;s for Mankind, freeing him from the Chains of Doctrine and Principle, triumphing in a State of compleat Athei&s;m and Irreligion, and in|&s;tead of wor&s;hipping many Gods, &s;ave them|&s;elves the trouble of Idolatry, and wor&s;hip no God at all.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it has co&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ome Pains, he has employ'd a world of Agents, and be&s;tow'd a great deal of Magick, to bring this to pa&s;s; nay, in my Opinion it &s;eems that he never
<PB N="236" REF="251">
was able to bring it to pa&s;s, no, not by all his A|gents, and whatever Pains and Expence he had been at; but on the contrary, it came into his Manage|ment by an unfore&s;een, and, even to the <HI>Devil</HI> him|&s;elf, an unexpected turn of his Affairs: For fir&s;t it &s;eem'd to be a new Di&s;covery in its very Nature, and what Satan had no Notion of for many thou|&s;ands of Years; and I do not find the mo&s;t Learned in the&s;e Matters are agreed yet about it, as whe|ther it is immediately from Hell, a new Invention of the Place, and &s;o introduc'd by the <HI>Devil</HI> as a Favour and Advantage to Mankind; or whether the Ca&s;e is inverted, and as Man has in this Pra|ctice out-&s;inn'd the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;o he has been the <HI>Devil</HI>'s In&s;tructor in it, and brought the thing to him, as a Projector does a Scheme to the Per&s;on whom he would have to manage it for him.</P>
<P>Indeed I mu&s;t do the <HI>Devil</HI> the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay I think it was the latter; that it never enter'd into <HI>Satan</HI>'s Head, as cunning as he is, to imagin any thing &s;o gro&s;s would go down with the World; that tho' it is true he had begun early in &s;etting up him&s;elf in the place of God, and had gotten him&s;elf to be wor&s;hip'd as a GOD, yet he never of|fer'd to &s;ugge&s;t to Mankind that there was no God to be ador'd at all; no Supreme Being exi&s;ting, to whom the Homage of the World was due, as to its Creator and Pre&s;erver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> knew the early Principles, and whence they were infus'd; he knew that it was a Fire kindled with the Life, and that could not be ex|tingui&s;h'd but with the &s;ame Life; that it was the Work of Nature in Man, twi&s;ted with his Rea&s;on, and as he thought it impo&s;&s;ible to be erac'd and ob|literated, &s;o he never attempted it. Not to believe a God! All Hell acknowledg'd the Mighty Truth, and the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf could never imagine Mankind could be brought to que&s;tion it.<Q><PB N="237" REF="252">
<L>Infernal Spirits Them&s;elves have deify'd,</L>

<P>This Attainment is indeed a new Invention; but like our late <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock it is run up, and has gain'd upon Mankind by a general Infatuation, and may well be call'd Magick in its very Ab&s;tract. Nothing indeed but a kind of thinking <HI>rightly call'd</HI> FREE, and founded on Schemes of the mo&s;t re|fin'd Infidelity, could act upon &s;uch a Sy&s;tem as this: What Magick mu&s;t there be to work up the Mind of Man to a Po&s;&s;ibility of receiving &s;uch a Principle, without A&s;toni&s;hment. No God! what a Shock it gives to the Soul, what a Blow to the rea&s;oning Powers!<Q><L>The &s;ecret Trepidation racks the Soul,</L>
<L>And while he &s;ays No God, replies, <HI>thou Fool!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Piece of Magical Work, and Magick in it &s;elf mu&s;t be a mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite Art, more refin'd and more &s;uperior in Wick|edne&s;s, than the mo&s;t &s;uperlative Craft of Hell ever arriv'd to, that &s;hould raze out the Impre&s;&s;ions of a GOD from the Soul of Man, where they were fir&s;t riveted by the very &s;ame Hand of Power that created him; that could harden the Soul again&s;t the Ter|rors of his Maker, and blot out all the Repre&s;en|tations of God, which the light of Nature and of Rea&s;on had printed upon his Mind.</P>
<P>It is beyond even the lofty Theme I am upon, and as the Power of Magick cannot reach it, &s;o it is al&s;o beyond me to conceive of it, either what Power it is wrought by, or from what &s;trange corrupted Fountain it flows. I confe&s;s, I cannot find in my
<PB N="238" REF="253">
Heart to charge <HI>Satan</HI> with it, for I would not &s;lander the <HI>Devil</HI>; nor do I find any Foot&s;teps of it in all the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story, or in all the Accounts of his Management in the World: I leave it therefore to the Learned Searchers into the Antiquity of the&s;e Times, to find out, if it be po&s;&s;ible, its Original, and tell us from whence it proceeds; promi&s;ing in the mean time, that if they will but tell me where it begun, I'll take care to give them an Account where it will end, and that from very good Au|thority.</P>
<P>The bringing Mankind to deny the Being of their Maker, is a thing in it &s;elf &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;o &s;hock|ing to Nature and to common Sen&s;e, that it can|not but rai&s;e our Curio&s;ity, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out its Original; I acknowledge my &s;elf to have lo&s;t a great deal of Labour in the Search, nor have all the Methods I have hitherto taken been able to give me any con&s;iderable Light into the Matter. I am loth I confe&s;s to go to <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf to en|quire about it, and &s;o deal with the <HI>Devil</HI> my &s;elf, while I am exploding the Practice in others. Be|&s;ides, I am very doubtful, whether, if I did, he could give me a true, or at lea&s;t, a full Ac|count of it; for I am under a full Per&s;wa&s;ion that it is beyond him, that the Original was from the Nature of Man, arriv'd by his own Improvement to a height beyond his fir&s;t In&s;tructor. How the Heart of Man became receptive of Wickedne&s;s be|yond the Power of Hell and Devils to infu&s;e, is a Point too curious to dwell upon here, we may meet with it again in our way.</P>
<P>It may be true, and we have good rea&s;on to &s;ay we find it &s;o, that the <HI>Devil</HI> greedily embrac'd the Propo&s;al; and like the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when <HI>Colum|bus</HI> brought him the fir&s;t News of a new World in <HI>America</HI> offer'd to his Government, and adding a new Empire to his Dominiom; He who&s;e Ambi|tion
<PB N="239" REF="254">
had before gra&s;p'd the whole World in Ima|gination, yet greedily accepted the Di&s;covery, how mean &s;oever the Di&s;coverer was. Thus <HI>Satan,</HI> however out-witted and out-&s;inn'd by the Dexte|rity of Men, being &s;hew'd a way of in&s;ulting his Maker, (his darling Sin, and the height of his Am|bition) which he never thought of before, tho' perhaps &s;ecretly di&s;daining to be out-&s;hot in his own Bow, yet greedily embrac'd the Di&s;covery, embarks in the Scheme, and prompts the wicked Contrivers to go on with it, with the utmo&s;t Ap|plication.</P>
<P>It may be ask'd of me, why I will In&s;i&s;t upon this matter in a Treati&s;e of Magick; that this re|lates to the Athei&s;ts, not to <HI>Magicians,</HI> and that by the &s;ame Rule, all Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, Here&s;ies and my&s;te|rious things in Religion, as well as in Science, may be rated in the &s;ame Cla&s;s, and be call'd by the &s;ame Name, and &s;o we &s;hall make a Magick of Re|ligion at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But let a &s;hort An&s;wer &s;uffice to this weak Obje|ction; All Errors in Religion are not equally Diabo|lic, no, nor equally mi&s;chievous; and as I have &s;aid above, that this &s;eems to be of an Original deeper than Hell, and out of the Reach of the <HI>Devil</HI>; &s;o, as far as it is a Crime which derives from the Man as an Independent, and acting the <HI>Devil</HI> by him&s;elf, I think it mu&s;t have the Height of human Imagina|tion and Invention in it, and &s;o may be call'd Magical, as Magick is a Sicence or Art of doing Superlative Evil.</P>
<P>If then it &s;hall be allow'd at lea&s;t to be, as it really is, an Extreme of human Wickedne&s;s, it mu&s;t have the E&s;&s;ence of Magick in it, as Magick is now con&s;ider'd; and therefore when I mention it in the Title of this Chapter, I call it MAGICK <HI>in its Practice and Perfection.</HI> What my&s;terious Power mu&s;t it be, or as 'tis u&s;ual to expre&s;s it, what Ma|gick
<PB N="240" REF="255">
mu&s;t there be in it, that Mankind can be harden'd to a Pitch, capable of denying the POWER that made them, capable of arguing again&s;t the Re|ality of that Being, which gave them Being?</P>
<P>Nor does the Magick con&s;i&s;t in the Fact, nei|ther do I lay the Stre&s;s of it there; or upon the Sin again&s;t Rea&s;on, again&s;t common Sen&s;e, the Ingrati|tude to their Maker, the open In&s;ult of Heaven, the Venture of provoking that <HI>Being</HI> who&s;e Power it in&s;ults, and many other things of like Impor|tance; the&s;e are things the People I am talking to, and the Age I am talking in, can ridicule, and make a Je&s;t of, and laugh at the mention of them; not &s;hall I dwell upon them, the Divines are equal to this Task, and their proper Work it is. I leave it with them.</P>
<P>But my Enquiry looks another way, and there the Magick di&s;covers it &s;elf; <HI>viz.</HI> by what &s;trange Influence, by what &s;ecret Wonder in Nature it is brought about, that Men who &s;ay they have Souls, that have a Capacity of rea&s;oning and judging, and who&s;e <HI>univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is to be vain of that Judg|ment, proud of their rea&s;oning Powers, and of their being capable of cen&s;uring the Defects of o|thers, that The&s;e &s;hould ever be capable of being thus impos'd upon, of receiving &s;uch a Notion, and even of de&s;iring it &s;hould be true. This is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing! and here I confe&s;s there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>Magick,</HI> &s;ome &s;ecret prevailing Artifice, whether of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or of what el&s;e, who can tell? Here mu&s;t be &s;ome Wheels and Springs, able, when &s;et a going, to give a Progre&s;&s;ion to the whole Move|ment; and here mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ecret Hand turning tho&s;e Wheels and Springs; be it Internal, Exter|nal, or Infernal, I leave it as I find it; only I think, as I thought before, my Judgment dictates to me, that the <HI>Devil</HI> is not in the Plot, that he had no hand in it, at lea&s;t not at fir&s;t; what he may have
<PB N="241" REF="256">
done &s;ince I know nothing of yet, and I do not &s;ee how I &s;hall, at lea&s;t not till I have made farther Inquiry.</P>
<P>In looking into this Ab&s;urdity, which &s;o many Men of Parts, and who &s;corn Ab&s;urdities in other things, are pleas'd to come into, I cannot but ob|&s;erve how bu&s;y they are; how many Arts and Tricks truly Magical, do they find out, to rea&s;on them|&s;elves into the belief of that horrid Incon&s;i&s;tency? What &s;ubterfuges do they fly to, what Arguments, weak as they are, do they u&s;e; and how do they cleave and cling about them, loading every Word that can be offer'd again&s;t them with innumerable Cavils, and with the mo&s;t apparent Sophi&s;try!</P>
<P>One &s;ort will have a God of one kind, One of an|other. The <HI>Sceptick</HI> forms the Notion of a God in his Mind, but &s;trips him of all his governing Pow|er, dive&s;ts him of Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, Holy|ne&s;s and Ju&s;tice, and all tho&s;e glorious Attributes for which he is worthy to be ador'd, and which make him ju&s;tly the Object of our Homage, and of our Affection too.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> &s;trips him of the very con&s;tituting Part of the Deity, and brings him down to a Level with our Rea&s;oning; dive&s;ting him of all Govern|ing, Protecting and Pre&s;erving Providence, and parti|cularly of all Re&s;entment again&s;t the vile&s;t Offences; robbing him of the Power of Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, and making him &s;o good, &s;o kind and graci|ous, that they do not leave him room to be Ju&s;t, or allow him any Re&s;entment let the ca&s;es be what they will.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> out-goes them all, and not able in|deed to reconcile their Notions to common Sen&s;e, much le&s;s to rea&s;on him&s;elf into their Opinions, audaciou&s;ly &s;huts his Eyes again&s;t Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e al&s;o, and tells you there is NO GOD at all.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="257">Now Magick puts an end to all this Difficulty; for by con&s;ulting the dark Oracle, and entring a little into the Secrets of the <HI>&s;acred Science,</HI> as they wickedly tell you it is; they come out transform'd into a new kind of Species, they tell you that they are arriv'd to a compleat Knowledge of the Eternal My&s;teries; that GOD is nothing but the Sum of human De&s;ires, the Ec&s;ta&s;y of an exalted Spirit, carry'd up into the Regions of eternal Calm and Quiet, where the Soul is in Raptures of Joy and Love.

<P>This unintelligible Stuff is all Magick to me, and I believe we may truly &s;ay it is &s;o to us all; it is &s;ome of the Cant of the Trade, the Terms of Art in that Profe&s;&s;ion; and if this be the Di&s;covery that Magick makes to the Mind, the Magicians will have &s;mall cau&s;e to boa&s;t of their Improvement, I pre&s;ume it &s;hall leave the Mind darker than it finds it.</P>
<P>Now that this makes room for <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> or <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> or <HI>Polythei&s;m</HI> in the Mind, it is very evident; for, next to the denying the divine Being, our enter|taining fal&s;e and corrupt Notions unworthy of

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Scene, chang'd; That as the <HI>Devil</HI> acted at Fir&s;t with his <HI>Black Art</HI> without the <HI>Ma|gicians,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Magicians</HI> &s;eem to carry it on now without the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HItherto I have made the <HI>Devil</HI> the Aggre&s;&s;or in all the Tran&s;actions between him&s;elf and Man|kind, but now we mu&s;t turn the Tables; for <HI>whe|ther it be,</HI> that finding things go on currently, and to his Mind, he only &s;its &s;till and looks on, like an En|gineer who has with infinite Art and great Fa|tigue form'd a new Machine, then &s;ets it at Work, and &s;eeing it perform according to Expectation, &s;its down with Satisfaction, and lets it go round of it &s;elf: Or whether the Nature of Man, corrupt, and prompt to all the fooli&s;h and foul things the <HI>Devil</HI> could put into his Head, does really run on fa&s;ter than the <HI>Devil</HI> can drive him: This as a Doubt, which either Philo&s;ophy or Divinity have not yet re&s;olv'd, I mu&s;t leave it to Time and Expe|rience to explain.</P>
<P>That thus it is, the Fact is plain; if the <HI>Black</HI> or Diabolick <HI>Art</HI> was at fir&s;t a Machine of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or let it be who&s;e it will, it works now of it &s;elf, it performs to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Satisfaction; he has little to do but to &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee the Wheels go round.</P>
<P>Nay, we may &s;ay, the Scholars teach the Ma|&s;ter, the Magician &s;eems to guide, nay to command the <HI>Devil,</HI> who&s;e Art it is that he profe&s;&s;es, and according to the Lines in my Title,
<Q><L>The ob&s;equious Devil attends the Sorcerer's Spell;</L>
<L>The Mill turns round the Hor&s;e, who fir&s;t turns round the Mill.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="264">'Tis worth ob&s;erving here, how remarkable the Turn is that &s;eems to be given to the working of the&s;e Infernal Machines. At fir&s;t, the <HI>Devil</HI> had &s;ome Difficulty with Mankind, was oblig'd to act with great Craft and Subtilty, to make his Acquaintance among them, as I have ob&s;erv'd at large; after this he got the A&s;cendant to &s;uch a degree, that he (as the <HI>Devil</HI> you know is apt to encroach where he finds room for it) &s;et him&s;elf up for a Guide, then a Governor, then a God; was fir&s;t follow'd as a Director or Advi&s;er, next obey'd and &s;ubmitted to as a Governor and Commander; and then (<HI>for he never re&s;ts</HI>) wor&s;hipp'd as a God; which no doubt was his fir&s;t, and of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be his highe&s;t Aim and Ambition.</P>
<P>But now, by we know not what Fate, Mankind &s;eems to have got the better of him; in&s;tead of be|ing waited upon in Form, and humbly expected, as in his fir&s;t Appearances; in&s;tead of being <HI>Paw-wa'd,</HI> and great A&s;&s;emblies and Ceremonies us'd to ob|tain an Audience of him, he comes now at every old Woman's Call, and upon the mo&s;t trifling Oc|ca&s;ion; in&s;tead of being a Coun&s;ellor or an Advi|&s;er, much le&s;s a Governor, now he's a meer Er|rand Boy, runs and goes, will do any Drudgery, work like a Hor&s;e, fetch and carry like a Dog, dig Ditches, carry Burthens, build Churches, or any thing the Prie&s;ts and the Conjurers bid him do; witne&s;s <HI>New-Market Heath, Stone-henge, Crowland Abbey,</HI> and a thou&s;and more things, which to be &s;ure the <HI>Devil</HI> did, becau&s;e we don't know how el&s;e they could be done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magicians</HI> were formerly the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ser|vants, but now they are his Ma&s;ters, and that to &s;uch a degree, that 'tis but drawing a Circle, ca&s;ting a few Figures, muttering a little <HI>Ara|bick,</HI> and up comes the <HI>Devil,</HI> as readily as the Drawer at a Tavern, with a <HI>d'ye call Sir?</HI> or like a
<PB N="250" REF="265">
<HI>Scots Caude,</HI> with <HI>What's your Honour's Wull Sir?</HI> Nay, and as the learned in the Art &s;ay, <HI>He mu&s;t come, he can't help it:</HI> Then as to tempting, he's quite out of Doors. And I think, as the old Parliament did by the Bi&s;hops, we may e'en <HI>vote him u&s;ele&s;s</HI>: In a word, there's no manner of Occa&s;ion for him; Mankind are as forward as he can wi&s;h and de&s;ire of them: Nay, &s;ome cunning Men tell us we &s;in fa|&s;ter than the <HI>Devil</HI> can keep Pace with us; as wit|ne&s;s the late witty and moderately wicked Lady &mdash; who ble&s;s'd her Stars, that the <HI>Devil</HI> never tempted her to any thing, he under&s;tood him&s;elf better, for &s;he knew well enough how to &s;in without him, and that it would be lo&s;ing his time to talk to her.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e our happy Friend the much honoured Sir <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> who values him&s;elf upon this particu|lar Accompli&s;hment, that he is able to SIN <HI>like a Gentleman</HI>; nay he merits much from Satan, in that, if he may be believed when he &s;peaks the wor&s;t of him&s;elf, he is al&s;o able to teach him (the <HI>Devil</HI>) to be more refinedly wicked than he is: This Sir <HI>H&mdash;</HI> certainly gives the <HI>Devil</HI> very little Trouble about him: and tho' I don't hear that the old Gentleman is yet come to School to the Ba|ronet; yet as the Baronet don't come to learn of him, &s;o he (the <HI>Devil</HI>) need not come to teach him, for that he is certainly as well accompli&s;hed in the horrid Art as the <HI>Devil</HI> can make him.</P>
<P>The Age we live in, <HI>fruitful in Black Arts</HI> (whe|ther in that which by way of Eminence we call <HI>Black Art</HI> or no, is yet undetermined) affords us many, I dare not &s;ay bright, Examples of flaming Wickedne&s;s: 'Tis no new thing to hear the Right Honourable my Lord &mdash; tho' his Lord&s;hip is known to be no Necromancer neither, rate him&s;elf above the low, mechanick, poor-headed Rabble (as he ju&s;tly calls them) who dare be <HI>Devils,</HI> but don't

under&s;tand it; have Impudence enough, but not a Genius to be truly flagrant: It is indeed a modern Accompli&s;hment, and requires &s;ome Additions of Art and Practice to be able to &s;in like a Lord. And tho' the great Man ju&s;t now mentioned may, per|haps, have rea&s;on to exalt his own Acquirement, and to boa&s;t of accumulated Crime; in&s;omuch that he would take it for an Affront, if the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould pretend to prompt him; and that perhaps Satan, who under&s;tands good Breeding, has had more Man|ners than to di&s;turb his Lord&s;hip that way, &s;eeing him go on &s;o happily without him; yet it may be acknowledged the watchful Seraph does find a little Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ometimes among &s;ome of his Lord&s;hip's Imitators, being at &s;ome happy Pains to form them, as the Moderns expre&s;s it, and make them as fini&s;h'd Devils of Quality as his Lord&s;hip; &s;o that we may be &s;atisfied there is no great Fear we &s;hall want a Succe&s;&s;ion of human Infernals, no not among Men of Rank.</P>
<P>Wonder not then that the <HI>Devil</HI> growing &s;o much out of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, and Men grow|ing, as I &s;aid, &s;uch Proficients in the Science of the Abominables, is in proportion humble as to his Con|duct, and allows him&s;elf to be the obedient Servant of every Star-gazer and Figure-ca&s;ter; that he comes when he is called, goes when he is &s;ent, nay &s;ome|times comes before he is called, and is the mo&s;t di|ligent <HI>Devil</HI> imaginable. He would be very ungrate|ful, it mu&s;t be allowed, if he &s;hould not, where the Age is &s;o obliging to him; but be&s;ides that, he finds it for his Intere&s;t too, and he is too cunning not to pu&s;h his Game where-ever it will go.</P>
<P>I have heard of a Magician, that, when the <HI>Devil</HI> and he had made a Bargain that he &s;hould always come when he was called, that is to &s;ay, that when|ever the Magician drew &s;uch and &s;uch Circles, and made &s;uch and &s;uch Figures, and then called him
<PB N="252" REF="267">
by Name, that then he &s;hould be &s;ure to appear, had a mind to try whether the Devil would be hone&s;t to him or no; and for making this Experi|ment performed all his Exerci&s;es, as I may call them, by him&s;elf, and when he had no manner of Occa&s;ion for it: However, the punctual <HI>Devil</HI> kept his Word, and came to a Tittle, which the Necro|mancer was mightily plea&s;ed with. After this he thought he might make a little Game with the <HI>Devil</HI>; &s;o he calls him up again, and when he came, the Spirit ask'd him, what was the Bu&s;ine&s;s; he told him, he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s, only called him for his Company, and to be better acquainted. Ve|ry well, &s;ays Satan, or <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> or who you will call him, for I don't remember that he knew what his Name was; but it &s;eems the patient <HI>Devil</HI> an&s;wer'd him 'Twas very well, and &s;hewed no man|ner of Re&s;entment; but after &s;ome Conver&s;ation left him again very quietly.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h Fellow, it &s;eems, went on with the Sport, making a Fool of the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o often and &s;o long, 'till at la&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> asking him, as before, what he called him up for, and he telling him he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s, but only that he liked his Con|ver&s;ation, and called him up for the &s;ake of his Company: Very well, &s;ays the <HI>Devil,</HI> not at all di&s;plea&s;ed, I am glad to hear it; then go along with me, and you &s;hall have enough of my Company, with|out giving me the Trouble to come &s;o far: and with that the Conjurer felt him&s;elf lifted up in the Air a little from the Ground, which made him cry out horribly.</P>
<P>I don't know what Argument, and Entrea|ties he u&s;ed, &s;o as to move Compa&s;&s;ion in him that is known not to be furni&s;hed with any thing of that kind; but perhaps the <HI>Devil</HI> was not quite ready for him, and knew that he might do him more Service in the Station he was newly entred
<PB N="235" REF="268">
into; &s;o it &s;eems he did not take him quite away that time: However it was, the Magician was ef|fectually cured of trying Experiments, and never offer'd to make a Je&s;t of the <HI>Devil</HI> any more.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould tell you the Name of this bold Spark of a Conjurer, and that he lived not far off of one of our <HI>Temples</HI>; you would perhaps wonder at the Man, who indeed no body ever took to have Wit enough to banter the <HI>Devil</HI>; but I mu&s;t not bring my Characters too near home; be&s;ides, who knows but the <HI>Devil</HI> may charge me with di&s;covering his Secrets, and betraying Conver&s;ation; &s;o I &s;ay no more: If any body finds me out, and gue&s;&s;es at the Man by the Story, I &s;hall be only &s;orry for the Per&s;on, not for the Picture.</P>
<P>As I was mu&s;ing of the&s;e things the other day, and having a great many merry Stories of this &s;ort in my Budget, was con&s;idering which was fit to be told, and which not, it came into my Thoughts, how travelling &s;ome time &s;ince, from <HI>Daventry</HI> to|wards <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> I met on the Road with a Coun|tryman, of whom, being my &s;elf a Stranger to the Road, I asked the Way to <HI>Northampton</HI>; the Coun|tryman told me, but with a Tone of Melancholy and Dejection, that he was going to <HI>Northampton,</HI> and if I plea&s;ed, and I would not over-ride him, he would &s;how me the Way.</P>
<P>I was very glad of his offer'd Service, and &s;o &s;uiting my Pace to his, for he had but a very poor Hor&s;e, we went on together; I &s;till perceived the Man to be pen&s;ive and &s;ad, &s;poke little, and never but when I asked him &s;ome Que&s;tion which oblig'd him to an An&s;wer; often &s;igh'd and lifted up his Hands, and &s;ometimes his Eyes, and minded his Way &s;o little, that if his Hor&s;e had not been more &s;agacious than he, the Man would have run again&s;t a Po&s;t, or into a Ditch; and two or three times he did get into a Hole or &s;ome other ill Place in the

<P>Why do you think the <HI>Devil</HI> is more your Friend than theirs? do you think he cares how ma|ny Whores and Cuckolds there are?</P>

<P>Nay that's true indeed, I did not think of that; but however, I &s;hall be informed where I am going, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> knows any thing of it or no; and if he does&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but do you call that going to the <HI>De|vil?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes certainly, for he deals with the <HI>Devil,</HI> or el&s;e he could never do &s;uch &s;trange things.</P>

<P>What &s;trange things does he do?</P>

<P>And &s;o you think he can tell who has cuck|olded you, don't you?</P>

<P>To be &s;ure he can, Ma&s;ter; why &s;hould not he tell one thing as well as another?</P>

<P>He'll take your Money to be &s;ure, that's all you can be &s;ure of. I tell thee, Countryman, 'tis all a Cheat; they are only Rogues and Jugglers, they know nothing of the matter.</P>

<P>Ay, I told you the <HI>Devil</HI> had been with you, 'tis he makes you talk of Revenge; that's all the <HI>Devil,</HI> and ends in Damnation; for if he is a Spirit which waits to devour, and that does all he can to de&s;troy us, we may very well think all evil Motions come from him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, he deals with the <HI>Devil,</HI> not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think, as I &s;aid before, the <HI>De|vil</HI> would befriend you &s;o far as to hinder your Wife's Wickedne&s;s? do think he would not rather make her wickeder than &s;he is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, that's true; but however, I'd try what I can do; I am re&s;olv'd I'll go to him.</P>

<P>When I found he was &s;o po&s;itive, I bad him e'en go and try the Experiment; but depend upon it, &s;aid I, the <HI>Devil</HI> won't betray the Secret to you; he is too much o' t'other Side.</P>
<P>By this time we were come to <HI>Queen</HI>'s-<HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> a little of this &s;ide <HI>Northampton,</HI>; and &s;eeing the Town from the Hill, I offer'd to go on fa&s;ter, &s;eeing I knew the Way was before me: but he be|&s;poke me to keep him Company; for, Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, if you lye in the Town all Night, I'll cer|tainly come and tell you what the <HI>cunning Man</HI> &s;ays to me.</P>
<P>I was not unwilling to hear the Re&s;ult of the Story, but was particularly curious to hear what the Magician at <HI>Oundle</HI> could do; &s;o I re&s;olved to &s;tay at <HI>Northampton</HI> that Night, and we kept Com|pany together to the Town. When we came to the Town, I put up at the <HI>George Inn,</HI> and thought he would have gone in with me; but when we came to the Door, he bad me Good-by for the pre&s;ent, for the Cunning Man, he &s;aid, liv'd two Miles out of the Town, and he would talk with him, and come to me at Night.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="279">I went into my Inn and &s;taid there all Night, but heard no more of my poor Cuckold the Coun|tryman all that Evening. The next Morning I was indi&s;po&s;ed, which made me &s;tay longer at the Inn than I intended, and indeed was obliged to &s;tay there all that Day and Night too, but &s;till I had no News of my Countryman, which made me a little chagreen; but at la&s;t he came back again, and comes to me, but not 'till the next Day about eleven a-Clock.</P>
<P>Then as I had been waiting before very patient|ly, I began, and &s;poke a little angrily; What's the Bu&s;ine&s;s now, &s;ays I, what's the matter with you, that you dodge about &s;o?</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;ays he, let me come in, and I'll tell you the &s;trange&s;t things&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, come in then, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and &s;it down; I thought you had been lo&s;t, or had forgot your Promi&s;e. So he came in, and we begun another &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, as follows:</P>

<P>Ay, ay, they are in the right, 'tis the only thing I can call them cunning Men for.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why are they cunning in that?</P>

<SP>

<P>That is to &s;ay, he &s;aw there was no more to be had, &s;o he took what he could get; and &s;o they all do. But come, what did he do for it, what did he tell thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>O he examined me very &s;trictly, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Examine you, about what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how long my Wife had been gone, what &s;he carried with her, what a-Clock &s;he went at, what file &s;aid at parting; and took every thing down in Figures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, this was all Grimace, to put a Countenance upon things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he bid me hold my Tongue, and he fell to making Figures and mutt'ring to him&s;elf; and on a &s;udden he &s;tarts up; Well, &s;ays he, I find your Wife is gone away, and that you beat her very &s;everely before &s;he went. Now, I could not deny that Part, Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e I knew it was true; but how &s;hould he know that, Ma&s;ter, if he wan't a cunning Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well enough: when he had examined you &s;o &s;trictly before in all the Particulars, he might ea&s;i|ly gue&s;s you had u&s;ed her hardly, by the Rage you were in, when you came to him; and when you talk'd of hanging your &s;elf and murthering her, he might ea&s;ily judge that you had talked the &s;ame to her, which had frighted the Woman, and &s;he was run away for fear of you; there's no great cunning in all that. I was a going to &s;ay &s;o to you my &s;elf once, for I really thought of it before.</P>

<P>Why then you are as much a cunning Man as he.</P>

<P>Nothing to the purpo&s;e, only to vex me and make me mad.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="264" REF="281">
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Ma&s;ter, he fell to &s;cribbling and &s;crawling again upon a Piece of Paper, and then he ri&s;es and walks up and down, and round and round, as I thought, he made Circles three or four times, and talk'd to him&s;elf all the while.</P>

<P>Well, and how then, what came of it?</P>

<P>Came on it! why, Ma&s;ter, the Man's a Rogue, a meer Cheat; he had got my Money, and when all come to all, he told me nothing, at lea&s;t nothing that &s;ignified any thing to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what was it? for I find he told you &s;omething, tho' you don't like it: did he bid you go home and be quiet and ea&s;ie, and not trou|ble your &s;elf about it?</P>

<P>Hang him, Rogue; when he had made all his Turns, and his Circles, and &s;aid all his Witch|craft over to him&s;elf, he &s;its down and calls me to him, and very civilly bad me &s;it down, and begun his ugly Story.</P>

<P>I'll tell it you all, Ma&s;ter, if you'll have Patience; he's a Rogue; a Rogue, Ma&s;ter. I told you he would have my Money beforehand, and &s;o he had, or he &s;hould never ha' had a Farthing; and he knew that well enough.</P>

<P>Why, as grave as a Judge, he takes me by the Hand, felt my Pul&s;e, holding his conjuring Paper in t'other Hand, all the while; Heark thee, Friend, &s;ays he, I have calculated the Times and the Sea&s;ons, I have brought your Names in a direct Oppo&s;ition, I have done every thing to &s;atisfy you, that can be done, and all my Numbers and Accounts agree, and this is the Sum of your Ca&s;e; You are a poor, hone&s;t, fretful, pa&s;&s;ionate Fellow that &s;tands here on one Side; and then he &s;hewed me his damned Figures, and Cro&s;&s;es and Circles, on one &s;ide; and here's your poor Wi&s;e a t'other &s;ide, &s;ays he; and then he &s;hewed me his Figures again; &s;he has anger'd you, and &s;colded at you for your ill U&s;age of her, and you have fallen upon her and beaten her un|mercifully, and threaten'd to murther her, and &s;he is run away for fear of it; and now you call her Whore, and come to me to tell you who has made a Cuckold of you.</P>

<P>Yes, Ma&s;ter, and a great deal more, like a Rogue as he is. He a cunning Man! he's a Block|head; why, I knew all that before.</P>

<P>Well then, you'll make him a cunning Man indeed, at the &s;ame time that you call him a Block|head and a Fool. I tell you I gather'd as much be|fore from you, and you can't help it; you are too full of your own Story. But go on, what did he &s;ay then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Upon my Word, Friend, whether he be a cunning Man or no, that I have nothing to &s;ay to; he may make thee believe &s;o, that's for his Ad|vantage; but o'my Con&s;cience I think he's a wi&s;e Man, and an hone&s;t Man, and I would advi&s;e thee to follow his Coun&s;el; for I do tell thee, I firmly believe 'tis thy Ca&s;e to a Tittle, and I tell thee thy whole Di&s;cour&s;e di&s;cover'd it; he might have &s;aid it all without his Figures and Circles; that was done to amu&s;e you, but 'tis plain from all you have &s;aid, that's thy very Ca&s;e.</P>

<P>Truly Ma&s;ter, I don't know whether I can tell it you or no, for I have been frighted out of my Wits. I'm &s;ure if my Hat had been on, my Hair would have lifted it off, tho' I had had a good Basket of Apples upon my Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come let me hear it however, as well as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Ma&s;ter, when I came to the Man's Hou&s;e, ('tis within two Mile of <HI>Oundle</HI> I think, or thereabout,) it was almo&s;t dark, and that made it the wor&s;e. I knock'd at the Door, and out came a tall black frightful old Man. I begun to be fright|ed at the very fir&s;t Sight, for I thought it had been the <HI>Devil</HI> was come before I ask'd for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you &s;ure it was not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think he was not the <HI>Devil,</HI> for he &s;poke very civilly to me; and when I ask'd him if he was the cunning Man, he &s;mil'd, and bad me come in; &s;o he carry'd me into a large Room, which had but one dim burning Candle in it, and I trembl'd every Inch of me, for I thought the Candle burnt blue as &s;oon as I look'd at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, &s;o you thought you were come into good Company, did not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I wi&s;h'd my &s;elf out of the Hou&s;e again, that I did; but the old Gentleman whi&s;tled, and in came a young Fellow that look'd like a Ser|vant, and he bad him go &s;nuff the Candle, and bring in another, and that comforted me a little; then he &s;at him down in a great Elbow-Chair, with a little Table before it, and upon the Table was a great many Books, and a Pen and Ink, and Paper. Come Friend, &s;ays he, let me know thy Bu&s;ine&s;s, for tho' I am none of tho&s;e ignorant Fel|lows you call Cunning Men, yet perhaps I may tell you what you want to know, upon a better foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="268" REF="285">
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he begun pretty high: what could he pretend to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I reply'd, Sir, I was told you was one that dealt in &s;ecret things, that under&s;tood the <HI>Black Art,</HI> and tho&s;e we call Cunning Men; if I am mi|&s;taken, I am very &s;orry: and &s;o made as if I would go away again, but he &s;topp'd me, and &s;aid, Look you Friend, I am none of tho&s;e Fellows you call cunning Men, I look upon them to be all Cheats; my Practice is all Divine, of a &s;uperior Nature, I &s;tudy things in a higher Sphere, I deal in the My|&s;teries of an invi&s;ible World, and conver&s;e with the World of Spirits unembody'd, who are beneficent and kind to us, who are Spirits embody'd, and not only conver&s;e with us below, but are helpful and &s;erviceable to us on all Occa&s;ions. I can't remem|ber all his hard Words, Ma&s;ter, but he &s;aid a deal more to that purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, did not he ask for your Money be|fore hand too, as t'other did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, but when he bad me tell him my Ca&s;e, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out two half Crowns, and went to offer him the Money, for I found he was not an ordinary Fel|low, and &s;o I thought he would not be very low-priz'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he took the Money, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he &s;aid he did not do the&s;e things for Money, as he found I believ'd he did; but he &s;aid, you may put what you plea&s;e in there, poin|ting to a Box that &s;tood upon the Table; I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it charitably, and to better U&s;es, it may be, than you would do your &s;elf; &s;o I put the Money into his Box, which had a &s;lit like a Trade&s;man's Till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, this look'd great indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he bad me tell him my Ca&s;e; for, &s;ays he, I perceive you are a Man of a troubled

Countenance, your Mind is oppre&s;s'd, the Pa&s;&s;ions of your Soul have been in a Perturbation, your Spirits are fluttering &s;till, and in a Storm, tho' &s;omething abated of what they have been; pray be very free, and tell me your whole Ca&s;e, as fully and plainly as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I a&s;&s;ure you, he &s;poke in &s;tate with a great deal of Maje&s;ty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co. m</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and yet he &s;poke very courteou&s;ly too, and I began to like him mightily; &s;o I began, and told him my Ca&s;e at large, ju&s;t as I did you, Ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to &s;ay, that you wanted to be re|veng'd of your Wife, and to find out the Man that had cuckolded you, and the like; &s;o you expected pre&s;ently he &s;hould tell you who it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;o I did; but he brought me to un|der&s;tand things better, and I found he was in Ear|ne&s;t, and that he was not to be cheated. He ex|amin'd me too as t'other had done, and ask'd me abundance of Que&s;tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I doubt not, gather'd your Ca&s;e in e|very Part of it from the weak incon&s;i&s;tent Account you gave him of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that; but after he had done asking me all his Que&s;tions, he took his Pen and Ink too, and wrote down a great many things upon his Paper, and made Lines with a &s;hort bra&s;s Rule and a Pencil, and then took out a pair of Compa&s;&s;es, and drew &s;everal Figures and Marks, but I under|&s;tood nothing of them, neither could I &s;ee them di&s;tinctly by the Candle Light; then he ask'd me my Chri&s;tian Name, which I told him was <HI>Edward,</HI> and he &s;et it down in great Letters, but &s;uch as tho' I can read Ma&s;ter, I am &s;ure that I never &s;aw &s;uch Before. Then he ask'd my Wife's Chri&s;tian Name too, which I told him was <HI>Abigal,</HI> and he &s;et that down in the &s;ame kind of Letters as before;
<PB N="270" REF="287">
then he ask'd my Age, and my Wife's Age, and the Age of my two Children; of all which I gave him a full Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you had told him that you had two Children; he did not conjure out that, did he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he had ask'd me that before, and I told him; &s;o when he had done all, and I believe we had talk'd together above an Hour, he ro&s;e up, and offer'd to go away, and I ro&s;e up too, but he laid his Hand upon my Arm, Do you &s;it &s;till, &s;ays he, and I'll come to you again; at which I was a little frighted to be left alone, and he perceiv'd it. Don't be afraid, &s;ays he, there &s;hall nothing hurt you, nor &s;peak to you; and if you hear any Noi&s;e don't you &s;tir, but &s;it &s;till here. So he took up one of the Candles, and went into another Room by a little Door like a Clo&s;et-Door, and when he &s;hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Door after him, I perceiv'd a little Window of one broad Square of Gla&s;s only, that look'd into the Room which he was gone into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant ye, you wanted to peep, did not ye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did, but I dur&s;t not &s;tir for my Life, becau&s;e he had charg'd me I &s;hould not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you was to hear &s;ome Noi&s;es, was you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I did not, except once that I heard a Noi&s;e like the drawing of a Chair upon the Floor, which being nothing but what was ordinary, did not di&s;turb me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how long did he &s;tay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>About half an Hour, and came in again, looking very well pleas'd, and ask'd me how I did, and then &s;at down as before. Well, &s;ays he, I have been con&s;ulting on your Ca&s;e, and I find things not &s;o threatning to you as I expected; perhaps you may not be in &s;o ill a Ca&s;e as you imagine; how|ever, I am order'd to tell you, that &s;ome Days af|ter your return, your Wife &s;hall come to a Hou&s;e

near you, and &s;end to know if you will receive her again kindly; if the Per&s;on &s;he &s;ends is a Woman, you may conclude your Wife has abus'd you; but if &s;he &s;ends a Man, then &s;he is innocent, and you are mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was point-blank, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not like it however, and that he might &s;ee well enough; for I can't allow any if's or and's. Tell me of being mi&s;taken! &s;aid I to him, I can't be mi&s;taken. Well, &s;ays he, I'll go again and con&s;ult farther about you; and &s;eeing me be|gin to get up too, he turns again; You are not afraid, &s;ays he, are you? No, not at all, &s;aid I? Well, nor you won't be afraid, will you, if you &s;ee nothing frightful? No, not at all, &s;aid I again. But I ly'd, Ma&s;ter, for I was almo&s;t frighted to Death, when he &s;poke of my &s;eeing &s;omething; but as I had &s;aid No twice, and &s;poke it pretty heartily too, he &s;aid, Well then, come along with me into the next Room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt you were afraid then indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o I was heartily, and he perceiv'd it too again; Well, &s;ays he, if you are afraid to go into my Room of Practice, I'll &s;tay here with you; only, whatever you &s;ee or hear &s;it you &s;till, and neither &s;peak or &s;tir out of your Chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, did you ob&s;erve his Direction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed Ma&s;ter, my Heart fail'd me; I dur&s;t neither go nor &s;tay, but I'll tell you what I did when he was gone into the next Room, I went to the Window and peep'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did you &s;ee? 'tis odd peeping at the <HI>Devil,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw my old Gentleman in a great Chair, and two more in Chairs at &s;ome Di&s;tance, and three great Candles, and a great Sheet of white Paper upon the Floor between them; every one of them had a long white Wand in their Hands, the lower end of which touch'd the Sheet of Paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="272" REF="289">
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were the Candles upon the Ground too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a great deal of Ceremony about you, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;o too, but it is not done yet; immediately I heard the little Door &s;tir, as if it was opening, and away I skipp'd as &s;oftly as I could tread, and got into my Chair again, and &s;at there as gravely as if I had never &s;tirr'd out of it. I was no &s;ooner &s;et but the Door open'd indeed, and the old Gentleman came out as before, and turning to me, &s;aid, Sit &s;till, don't ye &s;tir; and at that Word, the other two that were with him in the Room walk'd out after him, one after another cro&s;s the Room, as if to go out at the other Door where I came in; but at the farther end of the Room they &s;top'd, and turn'd their Faces to one another and talk'd; but it was &s;ome Devil's Language of their own, for I could under&s;tand nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now I &s;uppo&s;e you were frighted in earne&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o I was; but it was wor&s;e yet, for they had not &s;tood long together, but the great Elbow-Chair which the old Gentleman &s;at in at the little Table ju&s;t by me began to &s;tir of it &s;elf; at which the old Gentleman knowing I &s;hould be afraid, came to me and &s;aid, Sit &s;till, don't you &s;tir, all will be well, you &s;hall have no harm; at which he gave his Chair a kick with his Foot, and &s;aid, Go, with &s;ome other Words, and of other Language, and away went the obedient Chair &s;liding two of its Legs on the Ground, and the other two off, as if &s;ome body had dragg'd it by that Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o no doubt they did, tho' you could not &s;ee it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;oon as the Chair was dragg'd or mov'd to the end of the Room, where the three, I know
<PB N="273" REF="290">
not what to call 'em, were, two other Chairs did the like from the other &s;ide of the Room, and &s;o they all &s;at down, and talk'd together a good while; at la&s;t the Door at that end of the Room open'd too, and they all were gone in a Moment without ri&s;ing out of their Chairs; for I am &s;ure they did not ri&s;e to go out, as other Folks do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you think of your &s;elf, when you &s;aw the Chair &s;tir &s;o near you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think! nay, I did not think; I was dead, to be &s;ure I was dead, with the Fright, and expected I &s;hould be carry'd away, Chair and all, the next Moment. Then it was, I &s;ay, that my Hair would have lifted off my Hat, if it had been on I am &s;ure it would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but when they were all gone, you came to your &s;elf again, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>

<P>To tell you the truth Ma&s;ter, I am not come to my &s;elf yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>But go on, let me know how it ended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, after a little while my old Man came in again, call'd his Man to &s;et the Chairs to rights, and then &s;at him down at the Table, &s;poke chearfully to me, and ask'd me if I would drink, which I refus'd, tho' I was a-dry indeed. I believe the fright had made me dry; but as I never had been us'd to drink with the <HI>Devil,</HI> I didn't know what to think of it, &s;o I let it alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you might e'en have ventur'd, for the old Necromancer was but a Man, whatever Cor|re&s;pondence he might have, and his Ale would not have hurt you. But what el&s;e did he &s;ay about your Bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he told me the invi&s;ible Agents were favourable in their An&s;wers; that there ap|pear'd nothing but well; that he was a&s;&s;ur'd by the A&s;pects which any way concern'd me; that I was more concern'd about this Matter, than

there was rea&s;on for; that I &s;hould go home and wait, till by the Signals he had given me, I might judge for my &s;elf, and till I heard from my Wife as before; and that if I could make any plain Di&s;co|very, that there was real Guilt, I &s;hould come to him again, and he would endeavour to point ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Man.

<P>This is an odd Story, why this Man is only a Cheat like all the re&s;t; he bids you go home, and if you can find out any real Guilt, then come to him and he will tell you what to do; that is to &s;ay, he knows nothing: Is this your Necromancer pray where does he dwell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Ma&s;ter, the Man has done me n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrong.

<P>Well, but it &s;eems you are not fully &s;atisfy'd yet, becau&s;e he does not confirm your Notion that your Wife is a Whore; I fancy you have a Mind i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be &s;o.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.m.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't promi&s;e, Ma&s;ter, to take any of their Advices, or your's either.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>This Story is not told &s;o much to give an Ac|count of the Man, who was nothing as I could under&s;tand by it all, but a ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate Fellow to an hone&s;t Woman his Wife; but 'tis a kind of a Hi&s;tory of modern Magick, or of the Craft which is at this time in Practice in the World. Nor is it a &s;ingular Example, for we have many more Peo|ple among us, who are Pretenders to the &s;acred Sciences, as they call them; who yet do not level their Knowledge of them to &s;uch mean U&s;es, as to go Mountebanking with them, to get a Crown or two for petty Di&s;coveries, and &s;et up for what they call cunning Men; which is indeed the lowe&s;t Step of this kind that a Spirit of the invi&s;ible World could well be &s;uppos'd to take.</P>
<P>It is true, 'tis &s;omething hard to de&s;cribe what this thing we call Magick is, and how it is to be under&s;tood now; what it was formerly we know &s;omething of, and yet even then no great things were perform'd by it; &s;omething they did, whether by the thing it &s;elf as an Art, or by the <HI>Devil</HI> being pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, we know not; that which would be call'd wonderful is, that they did then, as they pretend to do &s;till, &s;everal things which the <HI>Devil</HI> really has no Power to do; and particularly that of foretelling things to come, which we do not, ge|nerally &s;peaking, grant the <HI>Devil</HI> to have in his
<PB N="276" REF="293">
Power; he can indeed make better Judgment of things than we can, but that the Knowledge of Futurity is given him, I deny.</P>
<P>For the Augurs and South&s;ayers, they did &s;trange things formerly; by who&s;e Power, is not in my reach, nor any ones el&s;e to determine: For Exam|ple; In the latter end of the Life of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> while the Ceremonies were performing in the <HI>Cam|pus Martius,</HI> the Emperor and a va&s;t Concour&s;e of People being pre&s;ent, an Eagle came into the Place, and hover'd over the Emperor &s;ome time, flying round and round him in the Air, and then flying towards a &s;mall Temple or Oratory, it &s;et|tled upon a little Pinacle, ju&s;t over the Statue of <HI>Agrippa.</HI></P>
<P>This was taken as a Pre&s;age or Omen to the Emperor, whether of Good or Evil was hard to determine; but the <HI>Augurs</HI> being con&s;ulted, they determin'd it to be Evil, and that it betoken'd the Death of the Emperor in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Another Accident happened the very next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> a Fla&s;h of Lightning broke upon the Statue of the Emperor, over the Senate-Hou&s;e, and &s;truck out the Letter <HI>C,</HI> from the Word <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> in the In&s;cription upon the Capital of the Work over the Statue. The <HI>Augurs</HI> were again con&s;ulted, and they again con&s;ulting with one another, and by the ordinary Ob&s;ervations, declar'd the Emperor would dye within a hundred Days; &s;ignify'd by the Numeral Letter <HI>C</HI> being &s;truck out, and that he &s;hould then be reckon'd among the GODS, becau&s;e the Word <HI>AESAR</HI> in the <HI>Hetrurian</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies a GOD.</P>
<P>Now it fell out according to this Prediction; the Emperor, and <HI>Tiberius</HI> his Heir Apparent, went as far as <HI>Beneventum,</HI> he was taken Sick there of a <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> and cau&s;ing him&s;elf to be carry'd to <HI>Nola</HI> near <HI>Capua,</HI> he expired ninety nine Days after the Stroke
<PB N="277" REF="294">

<P>If there are &s;uch glorious things attain'd to by Art, and by the Study of the&s;e <HI>&s;acred Sciences,</HI> where &s;hall we find the Practice of them? I think we mu&s;t be referr'd back to the <HI>Augurs</HI> and <HI>Diviners</HI> among the more hone&s;t Heathens; for we may almo&s;t an&s;wer for it, that nothing of this kind is &s;een among us; or at lea&s;t if it is found in Theory, and there is in Nature a Reality of Art, &s;uch as I have men|tion'd above; that Magick is a Science laudable in its Study, ju&s;tifiable in its Practice, &s;ublime in its Attainment; it is yet &s;o blended with the wicked Part, by the Corruption of its Profe&s;&s;ors, that we &s;carce know where to find one, either in Being or in Story, in the whole Chri&s;tian Time, who&s;e Pra|ctice can be allow'd to be &s;acred, whatever can be &s;aid of the Science.</P>
<P>It is true, there was a fam'd <HI>Magician</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who pretended to this, and of whom I &s;hall &s;peak at large in the next Chapters; and he &s;eem'd to act wholly upon the Principle of doing good, de|tecting, puni&s;hing, and expo&s;ing Crime: but I &s;hall give my Exceptions to it when I come to his Story.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent therefore the World are to be excus'd the Mi&s;take, if they run into it even with a kind of general Con&s;ent, taking the Word Magick and Magician in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e, under&s;tanding them all as practi&s;ing the Diabolical Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> a Conver&s;e with Evil Spirits, and a Dealing with the <HI>Devil</HI>; inclu&s;ive al&s;o of all tho&s;e &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es into which I have di&s;tingui&s;h'd it before.</P>
<P>Hence perhaps it is, that in our Di&s;cour&s;ing with even the mo&s;t Learned Men upon this Subject, a few, a very few excepted, it is very hard to bring them to any Notions of a Difference between Ma|gick and Witchcraft, between a Magician and a
<PB N="280" REF="297">
Sorcerer, between a Student in the exalted Scien|ces, a Conver&s;er with the Intellectual World, and a Wretch that has a Familiar, a Wizzard or Ne|cromancer; but they will, tho' they may be wrong in it too, have them be reckon'd all in a Cla&s;s, that they are all Practitioners in the Diabolical Part, and in a word, that they all deal with the <HI>Devil.</HI> Indeed the Difference is not ea&s;ily preceptible, becau&s;e of the Pretences which the wor&s;t of them make to the high Illumination, when they are really acting the vile&s;t Part, and that in the ordi|nary cour&s;e of their Practice; 'tis therefore by the Con&s;equences only, that they are to be known. Witchcraft and Sorcery may in one Re&s;pect be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be all Magick; but I mu&s;t not allow that all Magick is Witchcraft, as I di&s;tingui&s;h'd before between a Witch and a Wizzard. But &s;ee|ing it is &s;o hard to know them a&s;under, and that the Impo&s;ture is &s;o great, the be&s;t Method I can take is, where Hi&s;tory or Conver&s;ation will &s;upply Materials, to give you as many Examples of the &s;everal Practices and Practi&s;ers in the&s;e la&s;t Ages of the World as we can meet with, as well for your Diver&s;ion as In&s;truction.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here enter a Caution too again&s;t a weak, but vulgar Mi&s;take, which to the Reproach of hu|man Under&s;tanding the World has been very much po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with; and that is, to a&s;cribe every difficult unaccountable Performance to the <HI>Art Ma|gick</HI>; and every &s;uperior Genius, every Man of a &s;ublime Thought, and more than ordinary Capa|city, to be a <HI>Magician. Archimedes</HI> was a mo&s;t ac|compli&s;h'd Genius, and an excellent Mathema|tician, but we will have him be a <HI>Magician</HI> too. Fryar <HI>Bacon,</HI> who by his Skill in the Mathema|ticks, and the Doctrine of Motion, and of Sounds, made a Brazen-Head to &s;peak; of which by the way there are many Examples in Hi&s;tory, more
<PB N="281" REF="298">
ancient than Father <HI>Bacon,</HI> yet we will have this hone&s;t Friar be a Witch, a <HI>Magician,</HI> a Conjurer, only becau&s;e the thing was beyond the ordinary Conception.</P>
<P>Men of Thought and Head, who have a Genius a little above their Neighbours, have on all Occa|&s;ions been liable to be thus treated; even our Savi|our him&s;elf, when he acted &s;uch Wonders as the like had not been &s;een, and ca&s;t out Devils; what &s;aid the amaz'd World? The more weak and ad|miring and innocent Thoughts were amaz'd, the Text &s;ays they were a&s;toni&s;h'd; and at another time they were fill'd with Wonder, and the like; but the &s;elf-wi&s;e Heads, the pretending Phari&s;ees, having neither Knowledge to reach the Divine Power by which he wrought, and too much Pride to &s;ubmit to Faith, reproach'd him with dealing with the <HI>Devil; He ca&s;teth out Devils by</HI> Belzeebub <HI>the Prince of Devils.</HI> Mat. xii.24.</P>
<P>This Mi&s;take may therefore take place in the Ca&s;e before me; and Men who have &s;tudied, in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite manner, any of the Sciences which are lawful and commendable, and are arriv'd to a degree of Knowledge beyond others, may be &s;u&s;pected of <HI>Magick,</HI> and of the <HI>Diabolick Magick</HI> too, which I have been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>I will not venture to &s;tate the Bounds, critically &s;peaking, between the lawful Study of Magick as a Science, and the unlawful Part of its Practice as a Diabolick or a Black Art, any more than between the noble Study of A&s;tronomy, including the Motions of the heavenly Bodies, and that corrupt and horrid Impo&s;itio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that wor&s;t of Juggle, the mo&s;t &s;imple and &s;candalous of all Cheats, call'd judicial A&s;tro|logy.</P>
<P>That Magick may be a handle to Witchcraft, that one may begin where the other ends, this I will not deny; but I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, that if

<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing many Years &s;ince upon this Subject with a particular Friend, a judicious and learned Man, and one that was not ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, I &s;eemed to be doubtful of the Reality of the thing in general, and whether there was indeed &s;uch a thing as that of Men having Intercour&s;e with the World of Spirits, and whether we might di&s;tin|gui&s;h between that and Witchcraft, in&s;i&s;ting that I thought it was all Witchcraft, Sorcery, and the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>He told me he was of my Mind 'till &s;ome Years before, that he had Occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with the famous Magician called Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who he a&s;&s;ured me was a very grave judicious Man, and, as he believed, a good Man.

Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if I tire you then with the length of it tell me, and I will leave off: So he began his Story thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I had, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> a Friend, a young Man, who de&s;ired me, upon an extraordinary Occa&s;ion to go with him (as he called it) to a <HI>Cunning Man.</HI></P>
<P>'<HI>I asked him,</HI> What was the Bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>'<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence to him, and tho' he did not care to tell it ju&s;t then, yet I &s;hould know it afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="303">'<HI>I told him,</HI> I had no Faith at all in tho&s;e &s;ort of People whom they called Cunning Men.</P>
<P>'Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I believe they deal with the <HI>De|vil,</HI> but I don't care for that, if I can but have Sa|tisfaction in what I go about.</P>
<P>'<HI>I told him,</HI> I differ'd from him in that too, for I neither believed that they dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> with them; or that they could &s;ay any thing to him that was to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>'Why, they do tell &s;trange things, <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>'<HI>I told him,</HI> I believed nothing of it; but that it was all a Cheat; and &s;o I &s;eem'd loth to have him go to the <HI>Cunning Man</HI> at all.</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> You mu&s;t under&s;tand here, that my Friend was not &s;o really doubtful as he made the young Man believe he was; but, as he had told me before, he believ'd there was &s;ome|thing in it, but he could never come at the Speech of one of the Pretenders to the Art, and &s;o was entirely ignorant of what they did, or how they proceeded, and therefore (as he told me) he was mighty willing to go with him, tho' he made &s;ome Shew of being back-backwards; &s;o he went on with his Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I was not only loth to let him go, &s;ays my Friend, but I told him I did not care for it, and therefore de&s;ired he would excu&s;e me going with him; but when he told me who the cunning Man was, and that he would go to the famous Dr. <HI>Boreman,</HI> my Curio&s;ity prevail'd with me, not only not to per&s;wade him again&s;t going, but to re&s;olve to go with him my &s;elf.</P>
<P>'In a word, we appointed a Day, and I went with him, for I had a great mind to talk with the Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="304">
'When we came to the Hou&s;e (it was in <HI>Kent,</HI> not far from <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> where the Doctor liv'd at that time; I don't remember the Place exactly) but, I &s;ay, when we came to the Place, a Ser|vant came to the Door, and very civilly led us in|to the Hou&s;e, and bad us &s;it down; leaving us in a large Hall, where we walk'd about, looking on his Magical Pictures, of which we &s;aw a great many, who&s;e meaning I did not at all under&s;tand, and the Servant went away, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to call his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>'After a while the Doctor came in with a Staff in his Hand like a Crutch, as I thought; and I thought al&s;o he was lame, having lately had the Gout: He was a grave old Man, with a long black Velvet Gown on, his Beard long, and the upper Lip of it trimm'd into a kind of <HI>Mu&s;chato,</HI> a Cap on his Head with a Border of Hair within it, as was the Cu&s;tom in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>'After u&s;ual Civilities, he began to enquire our Bu&s;ine&s;s; and directing his Speech to me, as the Senior in appearance, I told him, that young Man (pointing to him that came with me) my Friend, had &s;omething of Importance to commu|nicate to him, and which he wanted his Advice in; and &s;o, &s;ays he, I bid the young Man give the Doctor an Account of his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>'This young Man had; it &s;eems, a particular Ca&s;e which he went to him about; and tho' he had de&s;ired me to go with him, as I have &s;aid, yet he had not told me his Ca&s;e; &s;o I was oblig'd to direct him to tell it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Then the Doctor de&s;ir'd the young Man to give him his Ca&s;e in writing; but he told him, he could not write well enough, or explain his Ca&s;e &s;o intelligibly to him in writing.'</P>
<P>'Well then, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> tell it me in Words at length, and I'll write it down from your own
<PB N="288" REF="305">
Mouth: However, I per&s;waded him to write it down as well as he could; upon which, he de|&s;ired a Pen, Ink and Paper, which the Doctor or|der'd his Man to give him; and in the mean time, the Doctor ask'd me to walk into another Room; come, &s;ays he, we will leave him to do it, that we may not di&s;turb him. So we went in|to the next Room.</P>
<P>'Then he began a Di&s;cour&s;e, by asking me if I knew any thing of the young Man's Ca&s;e; which I really did not, and therefore told him &s;o; but if I had known it, I &s;hould hardly have given him any Account, for I took that to be a Piece of his Art, to pick as much of the Circum|&s;tance of the Ca&s;e out privately as he could, &s;o to guide his An&s;wers; but I quite mi&s;took the Man. From that we fell into &s;everal other Di&s;cour&s;es, and among the re&s;t, I asked the Doctor, if it would be no Offence to him to let us talk a lit|tle about the Study of tho&s;e things which he was &s;o fam'd for.</P>

<P>Nothing but this; that tho&s;e good beneficent Spirits, with whom Mankind had then the Ble&s;|&s;ing of a daily Society, fill'd their Minds, and in&s;pir'd their Thoughts with the&s;e noble and u&s;e|ful Di&s;coveries, and qualify'd them daily to im|prove upon them.</P>

<P>Sir, your Di&s;cour&s;e is very well laid toge|ther I confe&s;s; but you make a long leap, and &s;ome of it in the dark too; from <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Year of the World 1576, or thereabouts, to our time, which is about three thou&s;and Years after.

The good Spirits are the &s;ame; they change not, neither is their Good|will towards Men abated; but the cu&s;tom of the World has been, and &s;till is, to be &s;hy and a|fraid of them, take them to be evil Spirits, and, as the World calls them, Devils; &s;o that a good Spirit cannot now offer its A&s;&s;i&s;tance to Man, or go about to do any good to Mankind, but they are frighted and terrify'd, and cry out <HI>the Devil,</HI> fly from it, and refu&s;e to accept the Benefit offer'd.</P>

<P>'I have nothing about me, &s;ays he, or that con|ver&s;es with me, that need to fright or terrifie any one, much le&s;s that will do him any hurt.

<P>'I gave him an An&s;wer in as obliging Terms as I could, and &s;o we parted, and I came to the young Man, who waited for me with the utmo&s;t Impatience, and with &s;ome kind of Terror; for I found he was in a Sweat, tho' it was a cold Evening too.</P>

<P>'Why, I can a&s;&s;ure you, that he &s;ays po&s;itively he has nothing to do with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and if you had &s;een any Appearance, it would have not been an evil Spirit, or <HI>Devil,</HI> but a good Spirit; that it would have come to render you Service, and do you good, rather than have hurt you, and that you would have had no need to be frighted.</P>

Here was a Hou&s;e in our Town &s;o plagu'd with evil Spi|rits, that no body could lie in it; and when the Doctor was &s;ent for, he went and &s;at up all Night in it; what he did there no body knows, but he &s;o frighted the <HI>Devil</HI> to be &s;ure, that the Hou&s;e has never been haunted any more &s;ince; and the poor Wenches are &s;o afraid of him all round the Coun|try, that they dare not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>'Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what does he do to them?</P>
<P>'Why, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> a poor Girl can't let a young Fellow ki&s;s her, but the Docter will TELL; and if they prove with Child, he'll tell the Father of it pre&s;ently; nay he'll di&s;cover all the little whoreing Intrigues in the Country. Now, Ma|&s;ter, <HI>adds he,</HI> this is not Devil's Work; you know the <HI>Devil</HI> didn't care if they were all Whores, not he.</P>
<P>'That's very true, indeed, <HI>&s;ays I</HI>; but what then mu&s;t the Doctor be call'd? is he a <HI>Magician?</HI></P>
<P>'I &s;uppo&s;e he is, Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> tho' I don't know what that means. But he charms Folks, and &s;ets Spells, and a young Fellow dares not
<PB N="310" REF="329">
come near an hone&s;t Girl, for fear of him. Why, they &s;ay, he drew a Circle the other Day round a young La&s;s's Bed that was &s;u&s;pected; and when the Fellow, that they thought had to do with her, came to her, truly he could not get away till the Doctor was &s;ent for to relea&s;e him.</P>
<P>'And do you believe all this? <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>'Believe it, Sir! <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> Why, all the Country believes it, and the young People are kept in &s;uch Awe by it, that I don't think there will be one Ba&s;tard got this Year, no, not in twenty Pari&s;hes hereabout; and that's very hard, Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this War time too, when the King is like to want Soldiers.</P>
<P>'This Di&s;cour&s;e was diverting, but &s;till I wanted to hear of my Man. I was loth to go back to the Doctor to &s;eek him there; &s;o I was oblig'd to go away without him.</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far I have entertain'd you with my Friend's Relation, as I had it from him in a continu'd Di&s;|cour&s;e, and this la&s;t Part is merry enough; nor is it more than I have heard by many other Hands, I mean of the Doctor's Exploits; and particularly 'twas certainly true of him, that he kept all the young People, I mean the wicked part of 'em, in Awe; whether by Spells or Charms, and what tho&s;e Spell or Charms were, that I could never come to a Certainty about.</P>
<P>The Story of his per&s;wading a young Fellow and his Wench to get both into her Smock, and that when he was in, the Doctor &s;et his Spell upon him, &s;o that he could never get out till the Doctor was &s;ent for to relea&s;e him; and that he would not re|lea&s;e him till the Fellow oblig'd him&s;elf to marry the Girl; this Story, I &s;ay, is &s;o firmly believ'd all o|ver that Part of the Country, that no body doubts of it.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330">But to come back a little to my Friend, and the Story of the young Fellow that was with him, which I &s;hall give you now in a more &s;ummary way, it being too long for my Work; The Short of the Ca&s;e was this: The Fellow being heartily frighted, as you have heard, was no &s;ooner got to Bed, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep, but he dreamed that the Doctor came into his Chamber and to his Bed-&s;ide, with two <HI>Devils</HI> or Spirits with him; that he was at fir&s;t &s;o terrified, that he was not able to &s;peak; but that the Doctor &s;poke kindly to him, and bad him not be afraid, for that here was a good Angel come to him, to give him a full An&s;wer, happy, and for his Satisfaction, to all his Difficulties; and that he had nothing to do but to hear and receive his Me&s;&s;age, and be ea&s;y; and that upon this, the Spirit advanced clo&s;e to the Bed-&s;ide; but that he cry'd out, and refu&s;ed to hear him; at which the Doctor &s;poke angrily to him, and &s;aid, Well, &s;ince you refu&s;e the Advice and Direction of a good Spi|rit, we &s;hall leave you to the &s;ame di&s;turbing <HI>Devil</HI> which po&s;&s;e&s;s'd you before: and upon this the Doctor and the good Spirit vani&s;hed out of his Sight, and an ugly frightful <HI>Devil</HI> remain'd in the Place, which grinn'd and threaten'd him in a ter|rible manner, but &s;aid nothing to him: that the Horrour of the la&s;t Spectre frighted him &s;o terri|bly, that he waked out of his Sleep, knock'd up the People of the Hou&s;e, and told them the <HI>Devil</HI> was in the Room, and, in a word, di&s;turb'd the whole Family; the Ho&s;tler and a Maid-Servant &s;at up with him, but &s;aw nothing; and in the Morn|ing as &s;oon as it was light, he took his Hor&s;e and went away.</P>
<P>As the Doctor had told my Friend, and as he &s;aid to the young Man, &s;o it was; for being terrified to the la&s;t Degree with this cour&s;e Appearance, away he went to the Doctor's Hou&s;e in hurry enough.
<PB N="312" REF="331">
It happen'd that when he came to the Hou&s;e, the Doctor was at his Door, &s;peaking to &s;omebody that he was ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ing, and the Party went away ju&s;t as the young Man came up.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Well, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> what's the matter now? why, I did not bid you come till <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>'O Sir, <HI>&s;ays the young Man,</HI> but let me &s;peak with you a little upon another Occa&s;ion that has hap|pen'd &s;ince, and I'll wait upon you again about t'other Bu&s;ine&s;s on <HI>Friday,</HI> as you appointed.</P>
<P>'Come, come in then, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I believe I know your Bu&s;ine&s;s; I warrant ye you have been dreaming &s;ome frightful thing or other to-night: what, have you &s;een the <HI>Devil</HI> in your Sleep? you had e'en as good ha' let me have &s;hewn him you.</P>
<P>'Why &s;o you have, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> han't you? pray have not you been abroad to-night?</P>
<P>'Abroad, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> what do'&s;t thou mean by that? I am but ju&s;t out of Bed.</P>
<P>'Why, Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> han't you been at <HI>Wroo|tham</HI> to-night?</P>
<P>'At <HI>Wrootham!</HI> why, thou art mad; I tell thee I am but ju&s;t up.</P>
<P>'It's no matter for that, <HI>&s;ays the Man, &s;till &s;taring and wild</HI>; I am &s;ure I &s;aw you there, and &s;poke to you, and you to me.</P>
<P>'Come Friend, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I &s;ee you are fright|ed, and you have dreamt waking; you have dreamt of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or of Spirits, all Night; why, thou art not come to thy &s;elf yet; come, let me know the whole Story.</P>
<P>'Nay, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the young Man,</HI> 'tis a plain Ca&s;e you know the whole Story already, as well as I.</P>
<P>'Not a Word, not I, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>'Why, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> han't you told me the very Ca&s;e, han't you told me I have been dreaming
<PB N="313" REF="332">
of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and &s;een the <HI>Devil?</HI> how can you &s;ay, you know nothing of it?</P>
<P>'Truly, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> any one that &s;aw what a Fright you were in la&s;t Night, without the lea&s;t Rea&s;on, and &s;ees how bewilder'd you look now, might gue&s;s you have been terrify'd in a Dream, and that without any Witchcraft or Con|juring in the lea&s;t: But, <HI>adds the Doctor,</HI> what &s;ignifies telling me I know it already? If you think fit to tell me the Ca&s;e, well and good; if not, pr'ythee go about your Bu&s;ine&s;s, I de&s;ire not to meddle with it.</P>
<P>'With that he begg'd the Doctor's Pardon, and told him, if he did not know his Ca&s;e already, he hoped he would not be angry with him for what he had &s;aid, at lea&s;t he was &s;ure he would not, when he had told him. So he gave him the whole Story at large as I have told it you, with a great many more Particulars.</P>
<P>'Well, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> you &s;ee there are good and beneficent Spirits in Being, who are willing to relieve and extricate us out of Difficulties, at lea&s;t by their good Coun&s;el and Advice; and if thou had&s;t had Courage and Patience to have heard it, no doubt you would have had all your Doubts explained, and your Que&s;tions an&s;wer'd; and would have had no need to come to me: But the <HI>Devil,</HI> who you &s;ay &s;tood behind, and who af|terwards appeared terrible and frightful to you, prevented your accepting the good Coun&s;el, and the An&s;wers which you would have had from the fir&s;t Appearance: and as for my appearing to you, depend upon it your Imagination &s;upplied that Part, for I have not &s;tirr'd out from home all Night; be&s;ides, a good Spirit might a&s;&s;ume a Shape and Appearance like me, that it might be more familiar to you.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="333">
'But, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the young Man,</HI> what mu&s;t I do now? if I have rejected this good Offer, it may be the &s;ame good Spirit will not now re&s;olve me, or do any thing for me.</P>
<P>'Perhaps it may, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> or perhaps I may obtain a Re&s;olution for you; are you willing to &s;tay with me now, by Day-light?</P>
<P>'Ay Sir, with all my Heart; I'll wait all Day, and all Night too now, if you plea&s;e; for I am &s;atisfied now, that you will do me no hurt.</P>
<P>'In &s;hort, the Fellow's Ca&s;e was thus: (Take it in my Friend's own Words again;) He was de|&s;perately in love with a young Gentlewoman in the Country, had courted her a long time, and gain'd her Good-will &s;o far at la&s;t, that they had agreed to be married; but on a &s;udden, &s;ome other Object had pre&s;ented to her Friends, who had a better E&s;tate than this young Man; and he found his Mi&s;tre&s;s was at fir&s;t kept up from him; and at la&s;t, that tho' &s;he was at Liberty, &s;he was grown cold and indifferent to him, and he was half mad with the Di&s;appointment: That after this &s;he &s;eem'd a little kinder, and told him the Rea&s;on of her Coldne&s;s; but after all that, ano|ther thing perplexed him, and that was; That three Nights together he dreamt that he &s;aw a Neighbouring Gentleman ki&s;&s;ing his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and in downright <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> lying with her.</P>
<P>'This la&s;t tormented him, and he was &s;o per|plex'd between his Love and his Jealou&s;y, that he could not re&s;t; to this was to be added, that tho' his Mi&s;tre&s;s was kinder to him than before, yet her Father had given him a po&s;itive Denial, and he knew not what to do; and for a Direction in this Difficulty he went to the Cunning Man.</P>
<P>'Upon the&s;e things, the Doctor, after all the intervening Circum&s;tances which have taken up your time, gave him this very good Advice; whe|ther

by his Art, con&s;ulting of Spirits, or by what other Method I know not, but he deliver'd it to him in this Form, or to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>'Friend, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> the Intelligence which I have had relating to thy Affairs from the invi|&s;ible Regions, and by the Aid of tho&s;e good Spi|rits which thou art &s;o afraid to receive it from, is very kind and favourable to thee, if thou art di&s;po&s;ed to hearken to good Advice.</P>
<P>'The young Woman that thou art &s;o deeply in love with, is not di&s;hone&s;t; tho&s;e Dreams thou had&s;t in Prejudice of thy Affection are injurious, and proceed from the grinning, angry Spirit, which, as thou &s;aid&s;t, appeared to thee in thy la&s;t Night's Di&s;turbance: However, it would be wi&s;ely done, if thou would&s;t withdraw thy Af|fection from this Object, for I am well a&s;&s;ured her Parents, who are re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;e of her another way, will never favour thee; and if thou take&s;t her again&s;t their Con&s;ent, will neither give thee Portion or Ble&s;&s;ing, nor will thy Marriage be happy.</P>
<P>'Ask me not by what Rules I obtain this Infor|mation; quiet thy Mind in the view of other Offers which may pre&s;ent; pre&s;erve thy Virtue and Temperance; there &s;eems &s;omething in View, tho' yet at a Di&s;tance, which &s;hall be more to thy Satisfaction even than this, had it gone for|ward; and I &s;ee a Light of moderate Happine&s;s glancing towards thee from a remote Part, inti|mating that thou &s;halt be very happy, and live comfortably, if the Exerci&s;e of a patient and quiet Temper prevail over Ra&s;hne&s;s and Pa&s;&s;ion; but if the latter prevail, expect Mi&s;ery and di&s;tracted Circum&s;tances may be thy Lot.</P>
<P>'The Youth went away better in&s;tructed than I &s;hould have expected from an Art which I have &s;o very bad an Opinion of: But this
<PB N="316" REF="335">
Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI> was a &s;trange Man, according to all the Reports of the Country about him, and did abundance of things, even by the Methods of his Art, which carried a Face of Good with them, as is &s;aid before, <HI>Pag.</HI> 309; if it was delu&s;ive and came from the <HI>Devil,</HI> it was &s;o much the more dangerous, as it came cover'd and coloured with a Mi&s;t of Virtue, and a religious Character, and with a Mouth always full of a lofty Cant, as if talking from a divine Oracle, and directed by Spirits always employed for the Good of Mankind in general, and to do Acts of Charity and Beneficence to afflicted or perplexed Per&s;ons in particular.</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far from my Friend who conver&s;ed with Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI>: He gave me &s;everal other Accounts of him, which, notwith&s;tanding all the good things pretended to, and the fine canting Words of the Doctor, convince me &s;till that he mu&s;t have had &s;ome unlawful Conver&s;ation with &s;uch Spirits or &s;uch Beings as I &s;hould &s;till call <HI>Devils</HI>: That he u&s;ed Spells, and Charms, and Familiars; that he did not di&s;own the Appearance of Spirits to him, a&s;|&s;uming vi&s;ible Bodies, was, it &s;eems, well known; and that he had &s;everal Books of Magical Experi|ments I have heard it al&s;o well atte&s;ted; whether there were any wicked Magical Performances in tho&s;e Books, or not, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>It is true, or el&s;e general Report mu&s;t lye mo&s;t unu&s;ually, that he did perform &s;everal &s;trange things; yet they &s;ay he was never known to do, or direct the doing any Mi&s;chief, or to encourage any injurious thing: It was u&s;ual, as they report of him, to &s;et Spells for the Country People for the pre&s;erving their Cherry-Gardens from being plunder'd, and their Orchards from being robb'd: Take &s;ome of the Tales which pa&s;s for creditable, as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="336">That three young Fellows being gotten into an Orchard, which I &s;uppo&s;e was under his particu|lar Care, he cau&s;ed a large Bell to hang to the Heel of their Shoes behind, like a Heel-&s;pur, by which they alarm'd the Hou&s;e and rai&s;ed the Peo|ple, who &s;urrounding the Orchard, took them all; when they were taken, the Bells being to be pull'd off, could not be &s;een, and yet the Sound of them was heard all the Way they went to the Ju&s;tice of the Peace, till he committed them, and then cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another time, &s;ome Boys being gotten into a Cherry-Garden, and one of them being up a Cherry-Tree, he made the Boy &s;ee a great Ma&s;tif Dog &s;itting at the bottom of the Tree, waiting for his coming, looking him full in the Face, and grinning and &s;narling at him if he offer'd to &s;tir; &s;o that the poor Boy not daring to come down, was oblig'd to &s;it in the Tree 'till he cry'd out for Help; by which means, the People of the Hou&s;e came and found him in the Tree; and as &s;oon as they were come, he could &s;ee no more of the Dog, neither could any body &s;ee it but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Methods he took with lewd People of tho&s;e Times, were, it &s;eems, exceeding many, and &s;uch that, as the Landlord told my Friend, the young Wenches &s;tood in awe of him, and were terrified with the very Name of him.</P>
<P>No petty Thefts but he would di&s;cover them, even after they were committed; and if we may believe common Fame, if People's Cattle were gone a&s;tray, he would tell them which Way to look for them. Whether he could ha' told <HI>Saul</HI> how to find his Father's A&s;&s;es, I cannot &s;ay; But I dare affirm he could not have told him of the Kingdom, as <HI>Samuel</HI> did.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="337">And yet this Dr. <HI>Boreman,</HI> as they &s;ay, would not &s;uffer any &s;uch thing as a Witch to live in the Country, but expo&s;ed and detected them on all oc|ca&s;ions; and the wicked Spirits on all occa&s;ions fled from him, as was reported of the Hou&s;e which they &s;aid was haunted.</P>
<P>How to reconcile this to a Corre&s;pondence of <HI>Devils</HI> only, I cannot &s;ay; and yet that Magick Powers are communicated by good Angels, and by divine Ap|pointment, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;ugge&s;t; but the contrary &s;eems to be evident by the People of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> coming and bringing their conjuring Books, and burning them, upon receiving the Chri&s;tian Faith by the preaching of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> to the Value of fifty thou&s;and Pieces of Silver.</P>
<P>There are abundance of Books upon this Subject left by this Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI>; and &s;ome, <HI>as they &s;ay,</HI> with Rules of Art, as they are called; but they are kept &s;o up in private Hands, that I do not find they are to be come at, by any means.

<P>This <HI>Jacob Behemen</HI> took it very ill to be called a <HI>Magician</HI>; but he was a kind of a Vi&s;ioni&s;t. He pretended to &s;ee things invi&s;ible, and hear things unutterable; and I might add, he &s;eemed to have &s;ome Truth in it, for he publi&s;hed things unintelli|gible.</P>
<P>His Writings are either Magick or Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, or rather both, for I never met with many that would pretend to under&s;tand them, and never with one that was the better for them; except it was one very particular Man among his Admirers, who declared him&s;elf to be the better for them, only, and for that very Rea&s;on, <HI>namely,</HI> becau&s;e he did not under&s;tand them.</P>

&s;undry Occa&s;ions, and yet none of tho&s;e Spirits are hurtful to them, or join in any hurtful things.</P>
<P>Either the&s;e Spirits inhabit in the Regions of the Air, and &s;o are near us and take Cognizance of our Per&s;ons and Affairs, or they do not: if they do not, what do they appear for? if they take cognizance of us and of our Affairs, and yet do None Hurt, then they are not <HI>Devils</HI> tho' Spirits, for the <HI>Devil</HI> would certainly do the utmo&s;t Mi&s;chief he could; on the contrary, tho&s;e Spirits do eminent good Ser|vices on &s;undry Occa&s;ions to Mankind; they mu&s;t therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed at lea&s;t to be good and bene|ficent Beings, inhabiting &s;omewhere in the va&s;t Ex|pan&s;e of Space which we call the Habitation of Spi|rits, or the invi&s;ible World.</P>
<P>And this leads us by the Hand to that hitherto unintelligible thing called the Second-&s;ight; that is to &s;ay, that tho&s;e good Spirits make them&s;elves vi&s;ible to &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, and repre&s;ent to them the Form or Shadow of this or that Per&s;on that they have a mind to have &s;een; and even tho&s;e Per&s;ons are repre&s;ented not to do them Hurt, but oftentimes to warn of approaching Mi&s;chief, Death or Danger.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e &s;hould the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is never guilty of doing Good, except with de&s;ign of Evil, I &s;ay to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he foretell Evils a|waiting this or that Man, who cares not what Evil may or can befall him? to repre&s;ent to him things in Effigie, which &s;hall yet come to pa&s;s in Reality? to give him warnings of Evils in time, that he may avoid it? This is not like the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is always &s;eeking Man's De&s;truction. For Example:</P>
<P>The Second-&s;ighted Highlander &s;ees a young Lady with three Gentlemen &s;tanding at her right Hand, intimating that they &s;hould every one of them in their Turn, be her Husband and, however unlikely, this comes to pa&s;s: He &s;ees the like

number of Women &s;tanding on the left hand of a Man, and he is directed by this to know they &s;hall all be his Wives; the very Faces and Habits of them are de&s;cribed, and that &s;o as to have them known; and this, tho' &s;eeming at fir&s;t ridiculous, comes to pa&s;s. A Second-&s;ight Man travelling on the Road, &s;ees a Man on Hor&s;eback at a great di|&s;tance coming towards him; a great River being between them; He &s;ays to his Friend that was with him, <HI>Ride forward to the River Bank and you may chance &s;ave the Man's Life, for he will pa&s;s the Ford, but will be driven away by the Water, and you may chance a&s;&s;i&s;t him to get out.</HI></P>
<P>The Man to whom it was &s;aid, gallop'd up to the River's Brink and calls to the Man on the other Side, bidding him not come forward, for the River at the Ford was newly ri&s;en, and the Water or the Current would be too &s;trong for his Hor&s;e, adding that he would be in Danger: <HI>I know the Ford,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>better than you, mind your own Affairs,</HI> and with that comes on and enters the River, and was accordingly driven away with the Current, and in great Danger; but the Man &s;ent to warn him was &s;o careful, that running on the other &s;ide of the River, he had an Opportunity to throw a Rope to him, which at la&s;t he took hold of, and with great Difficulty is drawn to the Shore: and in that manner his Life was &s;aved.</P>
<P>Now, tho' it is true, that the Intelligence which this Man gave, was the &s;aving the Man's Life, yet they will have it, that this Man dealt with the <HI>Devil:</HI> How el&s;e, &s;ay they, &s;hould this Man know that the other Man, a Stranger to him, &s;hould be in Danger? But I an&s;wer, that the <HI>Devil</HI> has no Knowledge of Futurity, and therefore this could not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> or from the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="347">Be&s;ides, why &s;hould the Devil tell the Man, and warn him of the Danger of pa&s;&s;ing the River? would he not much rather that the Man &s;hould have been drown'd, and as many more as he could?</P>
<P>'Tis evident that in Witchcrafts and familiar Spirits, where the <HI>Devil</HI> acts by the Agency of the Witch or Wizard, they are always fam'd for doing Mi&s;chief, prompting to all manner of Evil, torment|ing the particular People they are empower'd to act upon; murthering others, de&s;troying Cattle, &s;etting Fire to Hou&s;es, Ships, Stacks of Corn or Hay; and in a word every thing hurtful, and every thing hateful.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome Rea&s;on therefore certainly to di|&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e Spirits who are kind, and careful, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Mankind, and tho&s;e that are mi&s;chievous, de&s;tructive, and declare them&s;elves Enemies to the comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Good: The La&s;t are evi|dently of Hell, the very Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure of the <HI>Devil</HI> ap|pears in all their Actions, and in the Ends and Aims of all the Emi&s;&s;aries they employ.

<P>They both act, at lea&s;t we under&s;tand them to act, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome invi&s;ible Spirit; or, as it may be more properly expre&s;&s;ed, the invi&s;ible Spirits act in them and by them.</P>
<P>As to Witchcraft and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that I thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k is plain, and needs no Di&s;cour&s;e upon it; 'tis known to be all from an evil Spirit, or in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Engli&s;h, from the <HI>Devil</HI>: There is no Room to di&s;pute i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; the Wretches employed acknowledge it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d the Helli&s;h things they do di&s;cover it; &s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed &s;ay no more of that, nor is it the Bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|fore me.</P>

<P>To me 'tis more a Wonder that it &s;hould not be under&s;tood; for it &s;eems to be nothing more or le&s;s than this: That &s;uppo&s;ing an invi&s;ible World, or World of Spirits, as we have already been di&s;|cour&s;ing, and have in part granted; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing there are &s;uch Spirits, and that they inhabit the in|vi&s;ible Regions; how near to or remote from us, we know not, and that the Reality of their Exi&s;tence is certain, this Second-&s;ight then is accounted for thus:</P>
<P>Two Ways tho&s;e Spirits find to conver&s;e with Mankind; be it for Good or Evil, that's a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf; I &s;ay, they maintain an Intercour&s;e with Mankind two Ways.</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Or the&s;e Spirits, acting at a di&s;tance, render them&s;elves vi&s;ible, and their Tran&s;actions per|ceptible to &s;uch and &s;uch particular Per&s;ons, and on &s;uch Occa&s;ions as they think fit, and as they find needful; without any farther Concern or Ac|quaintance with the Per&s;on, or communicating to him or them any thing of the Rea&s;on or Nature of the Di&s;covery, or any Knowledge of the Per&s;on &s;o making the Di&s;covery; and this is what we fooli&s;h|ly enough call the Second-&s;ight.</P>

<P>Some of the&s;e informing Spirts think fit to appear them&s;elves to the&s;e &s;econd-&s;ighted Peo|ple, and not to others; and if the Author of the De&s;cription of the We&s;tern I&s;lands of <HI>Scot|land</HI> may be credited, who al&s;o names not the Circum&s;tances only, but the Per&s;ons, they have not only abundance of the&s;e &s;econd-&s;ighted People there, but they have abundance of things di&s;cover'd to them in this Manner, and e&s;pecially upon the ap|proaching Death or Di&s;a&s;ters of any Per&s;on or Fa|mily.

<P>I was at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e in this Town, near St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and he happen'd to have &s;ome Friends invited to his Hou&s;e that Day upon an Entertain|ment, the Occa&s;ion of which I do not ju&s;t now remember.

<P>This Foreigner it &s;eems came to the Gentleman's Hou&s;e, not as invited to the Entertainment, but upon &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence; Dinner being ju&s;t ready he ask'd her to &s;tay, and told her they would di&s;patch their Bu&s;ine&s;s afterwards, and &s;o led her in among the Ladies.</P>
<P>After Dinner, the Gentleman and this Foreign Lady withdrew to di&s;patch their Affair, which was &s;omething relating to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> where he had an Employ; and in Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he &s;aid to him, Pray Mr. &mdash; who is that elderly Lady that &s;at op|po&s;ite to me? &s;o he told her the Lady's Name; and that young charming Lady is her Daughter, I &s;up|po&s;e? &s;ays &s;he.

<P>The Gentleman (who told me Story with his own Mouth) was extreamly &s;urpris'd at what &s;he &s;aid, and would fain have under&s;tood it as if &s;he je&s;ted with him; but &s;he affirm'd it &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;hew'd &s;o much Concern at it, that he could not carry it off for a Je&s;t; then he ask'd her how &s;he knew it? I &s;ee it upon her, &s;ays &s;he, I wi&s;h I could &s;how it you, I tell you &s;he is a dead Woman, all the World can't &s;ave her, for her Hour is come, ask me no more Que&s;tions. My Friend told me the Story immediately; the Concern about it had almo&s;t frighted him, and the Event an&s;wer'd it all; in a|bout three Days the young Lady was taken very ill, which turn'd to a Vomiting, and that to a Fever, and &s;he dy'd on the very fourteenth Day afterward.</P>
<P>Another time walking in a Friend's Garden near <HI>London,</HI> there was a young Gentlewoman walking in the next Garden, and there being but a low Wall between, and a Mount on that Side where we were, we could &s;ee her walking with her Father on one &s;ide of her, and a Si&s;ter on the other; &s;aid one Gentleman that was with me, Who is the mid|dlemo&s;t Per&s;on of tho&s;e three? we told him &s;he was the Gentleman's Daughter who walk'd by her.</P>
<P>Has &s;he been &s;ick? &s;aid he. Now it was true, that the Lady had been very ill, and was come into the Country for Air, and we told him how it was.

I earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd him to tell us how he knew it; he an&s;wer'd am|biguou&s;ly a good while, but as I pre&s;s'd him with great Importunity, he told me &s;eriou&s;ly: Said he, you cannot &s;ee it as I do, I wi&s;h I could not &s;ee things &s;o as I do, but her Face now at this In&s;tant is to me exactly what you call <HI>a Death's Head</HI>;
<PB N="333" REF="354">
that is, the Skeleton of a Head or Scull, and no other.</P>
<P>The thing was right, and the young Woman died within a Week after.</P>
<P>But to return to the Subject: As the&s;e Spirits we may &s;uppo&s;e can make any Repre&s;entations of things vi&s;ible, and that to whom they plea&s;e, &s;o it may be &s;uppo&s;ed they can make them&s;elves vi&s;ible al&s;o, when, and to whom they plea&s;e; and this is at|te&s;ted by many Witne&s;&s;es, and evidenced by &s;eve|ral differing Circum&s;tances, of which I have by En|quiry met with a great many in my time.</P>
<P>In the Highlands and I&s;lands, they tell you of a Spirit, which the poor ignorant Country People call <HI>Browny,</HI> or <HI>Bronne,</HI> as it &s;eems was the more an|cient Name they gave it, as the <HI>Norwegians</HI> have another, whom they call <HI>Bielke.</HI></P>
<P>Much Pains has been taken to examine who this <HI>Browny</HI> is, and whether he is a good Spirit or a bad; but mo&s;t of the Stories I meet with are &s;o fabulous, or trifling, or ridiculous, that I rather take the Appearance to be imaginary than real; If it be real, it mu&s;t be &s;ome low-priz'd Spirit, employed among the meane&s;t of People, and on the meane&s;t Occa&s;ions, &s;carce worth naming, and yet mo&s;t of them rather for evil than good.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, that where the&s;e frequent Appearances are, and the&s;e &s;econd-&s;ighted <HI>Vi&s;ioni&s;ts,</HI> we rarely hear of any Paw-wawing or Conjuring, no Black-Art-Men, very little Magick. I fancy it &s;eems rather, that what Bu&s;ine&s;s the&s;e invi&s;ible A|gents have to do, and what Intercour&s;e they carry on with this World, they generally do it them|&s;elves, they are not manag'd by Art, or call'd in to the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Arti&s;ts. But as they make things vi&s;ible at Plea&s;ure, they want no A|gents, they do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s their own way; and in a word, they have no <HI>Magicians</HI> among them,
<PB N="334" REF="355">
none of tho&s;e they call Cunning Men, or that con|&s;ult with the invi&s;ible World in behalf of others; it &s;eems they have no Occa&s;ion of &s;uch Men, they are not &s;o fanciful, or over-run with Vapours, as we are in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>Yet they have &s;ome Remains of Sorcery among them too, and particularly they are &s;trangely ad|dicted to Charms. In the I&s;les of <HI>Orkney</HI> they u&s;e a Charm to &s;top Bleeding, and they tell you it is as effectual as the &s;tronge&s;t Stiptick, be the Bleed|ing outward by a Wound, or inward by any break|ing the Ve&s;&s;els, Wrench or Strain, or by Di&s;tem|per; and for this they have particular People, whom they call Charmers. What Part of the Black Art or Magick the&s;e Charmers practi&s;e, I know not, but it &s;eems they perform it at a Di&s;tance, and without &s;eeing or knowing the Per&s;ons; only the Per&s;on who is in Di&s;tre&s;s by Bleeding, &s;ends his Name to the Charmer, and he &s;ends the good Spirit he talks of, and (as the <HI>Magicians</HI> &s;ay) conver&s;es with, and the Bleeding is &s;topt in a Moment. This the Charmer, as they call him does, by repeating the Name of the Per&s;on afflicted, to which he always adds &s;ome barbarous unintelligible Language of his own; upon repeating which he &s;ends the Me&s;&s;en|ger away, and the Cure is perfected. Now this is much the &s;ame with the <HI>Magick</HI> of other Practi|&s;ers; for this they tell you is the Charmer's &s;peaking to the good Spirit he conver&s;es with, who imme|diately flyes invi&s;ible to the poor di&s;tre&s;s'd Patient, and works the Cure.</P>
<P>The&s;e Charms are al&s;o of &s;everal Kinds, and for &s;everal Purpo&s;es; &s;ome to cure humane Bodies, &s;ome to cure Cattle, &s;ome to quiet great Dogs, and prevent their falling upon People as they go along, and &s;ome perhaps to prevent their Barking when a Thief may attempt the Hou&s;e; that Part I &s;up|po&s;e they won't call the Work of a good Spirit.
<PB N="335" REF="356">
They have &s;uch a Variety of tho&s;e things in other Parts, as well as in our own Country, and e&s;peci|ally in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> that it would be needle&s;s to give an Ac|count of them, and a little out of the way too in &s;uch a Work as this.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t come a little nearer home. The&s;e Arts are u&s;ed more on this &s;ide the World, as the ren|dring darker things vi&s;ible, &s;eems to be more the ca&s;e on that &s;ide; and as I am enquiring rather what our <HI>Magicians</HI> practi&s;e without the <HI>Devil,</HI> than what the <HI>Devil</HI> or any other Spirit practi&s;es without the <HI>Magician</HI>; I come to bring all the&s;e things down to your immediate Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>We have been diving into My&s;teries long e|nough, and been &s;erious till perhaps you are tir'd; for a little grave doings wearies us at this time of day; let us &s;ee if the Subject will afford us any Diver&s;ion. The Age is witty beyond mea&s;ure, and not a little wicked too; but whence is it that we have no Magick in our Wit? It is not many Years ago, &s;ince the &s;prightly Part of human Wit re|li&s;h'd with Mankind, and Men were bright by meer In&s;piration; the good Spirits, if &s;uch there are, dictated things of Value to the Minds of Men, they convers'd in the very Confines of the my&s;terious World, but without Raptures and Agitations; they had the Sublime without the Infernal, the Humid without the Horrid; they had the Fire without the Brim&s;tone; they could laugh without Baudy, and je&s;t without Bla&s;phemy; talk without Buffoonry, and vote without Bribery; write with|out Pedantry, and read without Party.</P>
<P>But now, ble&s;s us all! how &s;trangely is the Cour&s;e of things chang'd; what with good Spirits and bad Spirits, we do every thing without Spirit; we are all Magick, and no Witchcraft, the <HI>Devil</HI> with|out the <HI>Devil</HI>; we laugh without a Je&s;t, and je&s;t
<PB N="336" REF="357">
without Wit; we write without Sen&s;e, and read without Ta&s;te; we are lewd beyond Whoredom, and devout beyond Religion; we preach without Doctrine, are religious without Principles; pray without Doxology, and wor&s;hip without a God.</P>
<P>Now, how &s;hall we do to find out the Magick of all this? 'tis certainly brought about by &s;ome &s;trange Fa&s;cination, &s;ome Devili&s;me that we feel, and don't &s;ee. Here mu&s;t be &s;ome Intercour&s;e be|tween us and the invi&s;ible World, tho' I doubt 'tis &s;ome of the darker Part of it. Every Man &s;eems to me to have his Daemon of a particular kind, pro|per and &s;eparate to him&s;elf, by which he either go|verns him&s;elf, or is govern'd, I know not well which to call it; and &s;o he walks on in his own way, follows no body, and leads no body; but is a Principle, a Doctrine, a Governor, nay a God to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Formerly the Broachers of Errors, and particular Notions, had always their Di&s;ciples and Followers; and they judged pretty much of the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of the Doctrine, whether Religious, Philo|&s;ophic or Moral, by the Number and Quality of the Followers they had; even the <HI>Jews</HI> did thus of our Saviour, <HI>Have any of the Elders or of the Rulers believed on him?</HI></P>
<P>But now, <HI>God &s;ave us!</HI> &s;o many Men, &s;o many Maggots, <HI>Tot Homines, Tot Di . . . s</HI>; every Man broaches his own Opinions, preaches them to him|&s;elf, is his own Convert; his Soul is the Di&s;ciple of his Fancy, and his Sen&s;es the Pulpit of his Hu|mour; as for other People, as he teaches no body, &s;o he &s;corns to be taught by any body, and bids God da . . . him, if he had not rather go to the <HI>Devil,</HI> than not go to Heaven his own way.</P>
<P>Thus we live in a general Di&s;gui&s;e, and like the Ma&s;querades, every Man dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf up in a par|ticular Habit, not two appear a-like in the whole
<PB N="337" REF="358">
Place; and that the Simily may be perfect, the Humour carries it on to the minute&s;t Part; as the Habits are not alike, &s;o they are always particularly remarkable for being directly oppo&s;ite to the Per|&s;on they cover; the Phlegmatic dre&s;&s;es <HI>&agrave; la San|guine,</HI> the Sober mimicks the Drunkard, the Cha&s;te chu&s;es to dre&s;s <HI>&agrave; la Courti&s;ane,</HI> the Athei&s;t puts on the <HI>Religieu&s;e,</HI> the Chri&s;tian has the Ve&s;t and the Turban, and the Quaker a Habit from the Theatre.</P>
<P>In the Appearance of the &s;uperior Part it is much the &s;ame: Mimickry, and oppo&s;ite Capacities engro&s;s Conver&s;ation; the Beau turns Polemic, the Athei&s;t di&s;putes Principles, the Actre&s;s practi&s;es Mode&s;ty, and the Pedant panegyricks upon Wit: Fools write Satyr, as Clowns teach Manners; the Fops are the Men of Weight; and &s;ince, by Acci|dent, Wit and Sen&s;e appear'd under the Title of the TATTLERS, the eternal Clang of Tea-Table TATTLE has rung the Changes upon Scandal, and &s;et up for the univer&s;al Cen&s;ors of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And need we go any farther now for our Enqui|ries after <HI>Magick?</HI> could things take &s;uch a Turn as this, without a general Conver&s;e with the World of Spirits? will any Man tell me this could happen by the Nature of things, or even by the Things of Nature? No, no: invi&s;ible Operations are acted from an invi&s;ible World; the <HI>Magicians</HI> are in the right, all the great things they do could never be done without an Intercour&s;e with a &s;uperior Rank of Beings, be they Infernal, or what other <HI>Devils</HI> you plea&s;e to call 'em.</P>
<P>Take a few bright Doings for Examples. Upon what foot does the bright Lord &mdash; &s;it every Morning over his Chocolate, talking upon all the Works of the Learned, him&s;elf Unlearned to a Scandal?

<P>Sir <HI>Timothy Title-Page</HI> is an admirable Gentleman; his Knowledge of the fir&s;t Leaf of every thing, compleatly covers his Ignorance of the In&s;ide of any thing.

<P>If they do not think of this or &s;ome other way, (for Pen&s;ions will rather encrea&s;e the Number, and like Sweat-meats draw the Flyes about them) I &s;ay, if they do not think of &s;ome &s;uch way, they may I think ju&s;tly &s;wear the Peace again&s;t the A&s;&s;ailants, and &s;afely affirm that they go in Danger of being Panegyrick'd to death by 'em. For in &s;hort, &s;uch writing is little le&s;s in my Opinion than a poetical A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the Mini&s;ters are in Danger of dying the Death of <HI>Edward</HI> V. and being &s;mother'd with Feather-beds.</P>
<P>Heavens deliver every hone&s;t State&s;man from the in&s;upportable Burthen of Panegyrick, e&s;pecially where 'tis attended with two Negatives, want of Money, and want of Wit; the la&s;t makes the fir&s;t lamentable, but the fir&s;t makes the la&s;t un&s;ufferable; the fir&s;t is <HI>piteous,</HI> the la&s;t is <HI>pitiful</HI>; the fir&s;t is af|flicting, the la&s;t tormenting; the fir&s;t importunate, but the la&s;t impertinent: and as a wi&s;e Giver would give any thing to be deliver'd from them, &s;o a wi&s;e Receiver would rather decently &s;tarve, than to re|ceive at the Price of being a Plague to the boun|tiful Hand, and of being reliev'd, as the unju&s;t Judge reliev'd the Widow, to be rid of her.</P>
<P>As for the poetical Gentlemen them&s;elves, I think it may be &s;aid of them with re&s;pect to their Magick, as was &s;aid of a late Author of a Qua|druple Performance with re&s;pect to his Merit; namely, that there might be &s;ome in his Poverty, but there was none at all in his Poetry.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, however, there is a great deal of Magick or Black Art, or call it dealing with the <HI>Devil</HI> if you will, that Poetical Dregs &s;hould re|gale

the Age. If they were &s;ent to the <HI>Druggi&s;ts,</HI> and &s;old there for Emeticks, or made up in Lotions, and given for Gli&s;ters, I &s;hould not doubt their effectual Operation: But that they &s;hould be paum'd upon us for Wit, (By <HI>Jove,</HI> and all the Hell-born Clan of Deities!) I think the Au|thors, like Coiners of Counterfeit Money, &s;hould be drawn, hang'd and quarter'd, for High-Trea&s;on again&s;t the Peace of their Sovereign Lord King <HI>Drama,</HI> his Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P>Where's the Cadence, the Propriety, the Plot, the Genius, not to &s;ay any thing of the Wit, in any one Play, written for the&s;e two, or three, or four la&s;t Reigns? The Drums and Trumpets of the War, the Broad-&s;ides of the Fleets at <HI>Barfleur</HI> and <HI>La Hogue,</HI> together with the more terrible Cla|mours of the Street Mobs, and all the <HI>&amp; ceteras</HI> of Parties, Rabbles, Riots and Rebellions, quite &s;i|lenc'd the Mu&s;es, &s;truck them Dumb, and I am told they could never make any Mu&s;ick &s;ince, no not all Nine of them put together.</P>
<P>Now we talk of the Black Art, of Magick, of rai&s;ing Spirits, of having an Intercour&s;e with &s;u|perior Beings and the like; I think the Art of our Days, the Magick of this Age, has been exercis'd to lay the Spirits, not rai&s;e them; to &s;ink the <HI>Devil</HI> of Wit, not lift him up; and if they have any In|tercour&s;e with the invi&s;ible World, it mu&s;t be among the inferior Beings, not the Superior, if they know any Degrees among the Seraphick Train: Certain it is, the Impetuo&s;ity of our Wit has for &s;ome Years been all let off in Squibs and Crackers, and &s;o like the le&s;&s;er Volcano's of <HI>Lipary</HI> and <HI>Strombolo,</HI> have given Vent to the Subterraneans of Sulphur and Nitre, while the Quantity was moderate. Where|as when the luxuriance of Wit over-power'd tho&s;e &s;maller Eruptions, then Mount <HI>Gibello</HI> (<HI>Aetna</HI>) and <HI>Ve&s;&s;uvius</HI> roar'd aloud, and over-run all the Coun|try

Tho&s;e Comets in Wit which blaz'd in their &s;everal Orbits are di&s;appear'd, and when the Revolution of their Spirits &s;hall be vi&s;ible again, what A&s;tronomer, what Calculator can inform us? not all the <HI>Newtons,</HI> the <HI>Whi&s;tons,</HI> or <HI>Halleys</HI> in the Nation can &s;olve this Difficulty.</P>
<P>What <HI>Magician</HI> now can bring us to an Inter|cour&s;e with tho&s;e departed Wits, or a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the bringing them to conver&s;e with us again? If there is an Acquaintance with this World of Spirits, let us call upon the Sons of Art to exert their Ut|mo&s;t, and bring tho&s;e good Spirits again in play; and to re&s;tore the Commonwealth of Wit, that the new-fa&s;hion'd Ribaldry, which the World now re|li&s;hes for Wit, and the Dogmatick, which, upon the &s;tricte&s;t View of our other Performances, the utmo&s;t Perfection of them, may receive their due Cen&s;ure, to the Satisfaction of all the true Ma&s;ters of common Sen&s;e, and the due Mortification of the voluminous Scriblers of the Age.</P>
<P>Pardon me then, from the &s;trange turn of Affairs in the&s;e Times of ours; I &s;ay, pardon me to look back again a little to the Conjurings and Black Art of the middle Ages of Time, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e of them who did not pretend to deal with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and it will pre&s;ently bring us to an under|&s;tanding of things among our &s;elves.</P>
<P>After the ancient <HI>Magicians</HI> had tir'd the World with their Tricks, and the <HI>Devil</HI> began to fail them, except to tho&s;e who kept an immediate Corre&s;pon|dence with him by way of Familiar, there came up a new &s;ort of Magick, as well as a new &s;ort of <HI>Magicians</HI>; the Ca&s;e was this.</P>
<P>The People it &s;eems began to di&s;cover that the <HI>Magicians</HI> having left off that u&s;eful and valuable Study of Science, call'd the Knowledge of Nature, the
<PB N="344" REF="365">
Improvement of Art, and the In&s;truction of Man|kind in Wi&s;dom and Virtue, had turn'd their Hands to a new and inferiour Study; that they con&s;ulted Daemons and Evil Spirits, that they qualify'd them|&s;elves by helli&s;h Corre&s;pondences to do Mi&s;chief, in|&s;tead of doing Good; and that in &s;hort they dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> making them&s;elves the Terror in&s;tead of the Ble&s;&s;ing of Mandind.</P>
<P>When this came to be their Character, no won|der the People began to be afraid of them, to &s;hun and avoid them as a kind of <HI>Devils</HI> them&s;elves; &s;o that except a few, who kept up their Reputation by a clo&s;er and cunninger Manage, the People withdrew their Reverence from the <HI>Magicians,</HI> till at la&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> was fain to &s;hift Hands too, and act by other In&s;truments, or he would have endanger'd his Kingdom in the World.<Q><L>So Monarchs, when their Politicks grow &s;tale,</L>
<L>Change Mea&s;ures, and by Novelty prevail.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this Change of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Mea&s;ures, he frequently found Rea&s;ons to change &s;ome of his In|&s;truments too, and thus from the <HI>Magi,</HI> he turn'd over to the Clergy; and &s;o, as I hinted in its Place, the Augurs, the Auru&s;pices, and the Oracles came in play.</P>
<P>Now it happen'd to Satan, as it has frequently happens to other mighty Princes and Tyrants in the World; that finding his Servants and State&s;|men cea&s;e to be Popular, cea&s;e to be the dar|lings of the People, as they u&s;ed formerly to be; he found al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;hift Hands, di&s;mi&s;s his Tools and In&s;truments, and take up with others. So <HI>Philip</HI> II. had, as was &s;aid, eleven new Mini|&s;ters and Governors in the <HI>Netherlands</HI>; but no new Management; if any of his Agents and prime Mini&s;ters grew odious to the People, he valued not di&s;gracing them, recalling them, expo&s;ing
<PB N="345" REF="366">
them, and turning them out; but took care, that when another Governor came, the Government &s;hould be the &s;ame. And when the Prince of <HI>Par|ma,</HI> who by his Conduct recover'd the whole <HI>Low-Country</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> would have pre&s;erv'd them by his Prudence, when he had gain'd 'em by his Valour; the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Councils, which were all for Tyranny and for Cruelty, cho&s;e to di&s;courage that gallant Prince, rather than not car|ry on their old ab&s;olute Dominion. So every Governor there, if the People complain'd, was &s;ure to be turn'd out, and yet the next was oblig'd to pur&s;ue the &s;ame Tyranny, 'till they were peti|tion'd out, as others had been before them.<Q><L>&mdash; When Mini&s;ters of State</L>
<L>Cea&s;e to be popular, they know their Fate.</L>
<L>The Crafty Tyrant has no more to do,</L>
<L>But &s;acrifice a Favourite or two.</L>
<L>The Mobb are ea&s;ily cajol'd, and then</L>
<L>He changes not the Mi&s;chiefs, but the Men.</L></Q></P>
<P>By this Method, as I &s;ay, the <HI>Devil</HI> pur&s;ued his Intere&s;t in the World; When one Generation grew out of U&s;e, out of Fa&s;hion, and &s;tale, he took to another; when the Augurs grew &s;tale, when the Cheats of the Oracles were expos'd, when the Prie&s;ts could no more predict by the Entrails, he &s;ets his Wits to work to find out other Ways and Means, for the carrying on his Game: as,</P>
<P N="1">1. By a kind of A&s;trological Magick, in which he manag'd with a great deal of Subtilty and Art, bringing the Stars and planetary Influences into Play; and by an unpractis'd Subtilty, the Art was then carried on with Spell and Charm, by Words cut in Metals, and in Stones, divining by the Byril, by the Amathy&s;t, by the Lu&s;tre of the Emerald, and the Ruby, and by all the old Super&s;titions brought
<PB N="346" REF="367">
into a new Rule of Practice. This was call'd the <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI>; or the Sympathetick Conjuring-&s;tone.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious for this Work, to give a long Hi&s;tory of the Delu&s;ions and Cheats which the <HI>Devil</HI> put upon Mankind for three or four hundred Years Practice of this kind in the World. I &s;hall &s;atisfy my &s;elf only to let you &s;ee, by way of Abrigment, what the&s;e Tali&s;|mans were, and what the Authors of them pre|tended; take the De&s;cription of them, as collected from the be&s;t Authors, thus.</P>

believ'd that <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus</HI> was the fir&s;t Au|thor of the <HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> but others are of Opinion that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> were the Inventers of them, which <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;eems to in&s;inuate in the &s;econd Book of his Hi&s;tory, when he &s;ays, this People having fir&s;t of all given Names to the twelve Cele&s;tial Gods, did likewi&s;e engrave Animals on Stones. The Inhabitants of the I&s;land of <HI>Samo|thracia</HI> made <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> with Gold Rings, which had Iron &s;et in them in&s;tead of Precious Stones: <HI>Petronius</HI> &s;peaks of it, when he &s;ays, that <HI>Trimal|cio</HI> carried a Gold Ring &s;et with Stars of Iron. The Gods, which they call'd the Gods of <HI>Samo|thracia,</HI> were tho&s;e that pre&s;ided over the Science of the <HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> which is confirmed by the In|&s;criptions of tho&s;e three Altars whereof <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;peaks. Before the Pillars, &s;aith he, there are three great Altars, dedicated to three &s;orts of Gods, which they call Great, and Mighty, and Strong, and which are believed to be tho&s;e of <HI>Sa|mothracia. Apollonius</HI> makes mention of three <HI>Divinities,</HI> to whom he joineth <HI>Mercury,</HI> and re|lateth the barbarous Names of tho&s;e <HI>Gods,</HI> which it was prohibited to reveal, <HI>(viz.)

The mo&s;t an|cient <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> are made upon Plants, Branches of Trees, or Roots. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of them in the eighth Book of his Antiquities, and attributes the Invention of them to <HI>Solomon.</HI> They ap|ply, &s;ays he, to the No&s;e of the Sick po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Devil, a Ring, wherein a Root was &s;et

<P>'<HI>Tzetzes</HI> relateth, that a Philo&s;opher put a Stop to a Plague at <HI>Antioch,</HI> by a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> of Stone, wherein there was the Head of <HI>Charon</HI> graved. <HI>Apollonius</HI> made u&s;e of the Figures of <HI>Storks</HI> and <HI>Serpents,</HI> and the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> commonly made u&s;e of the Figures of <HI>Serapis,</HI> of <HI>Canopus,</HI> God of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> of the <HI>Spar-Hawk</HI> and <HI>A&s;p,</HI> again&s;t the Evils which might come from the four Elements, Earth, Water, Air and Fire.</P></Q></P>
<P>The modern <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> are not &s;o curious as the ancient, and we may know them by the Characters, which are purely <HI>Arabick, Turki&s;h,</HI> or of other Oriental Tongues. The principal Authors that have treated on this Subject in the latter Ages, are <HI>Camilli Leonardi,</HI> who has writ the Mirror of Stones. <HI>Geber, Bacon,</HI> and <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> who have treated of A&s;trological Magick, and of the Sym|pathy of Stones, Metals and Planets. <HI>Gaffarel</HI> has compos'd a Book on this Subject; intitled, <HI>Unheard-of</HI>
<PB N="350" REF="371">
Curio&s;ities. And <HI>Agrippa</HI> has treated of it in his Occult Philo&s;ophy. <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours</HI> relateth, that the City of <HI>Paris</HI> had been built under a Con|&s;tellation, which pre&s;erved it from Conflagration, Serpents and Mice; and that a little before the Fire that happen'd in the Year 588, they had found in raking up an Arch of a Bridge, the two <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> Pre&s;ervers of that City, which were a Serpent and a Mou&s;e of Bra&s;s. Some have de|rived the <HI>Arabick</HI> Name <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which &s;ignifies Pre&s;ervation. We will not &s;pend time to &s;hew the Vanity of the <HI>Tali&s;|mans,</HI> for we live in an Age that is not much ad|dicted to &s;uch Super&s;titions.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things went but a little way, com|pared to what followed; for now the <HI>Pagan</HI> Wor|&s;hip declining, the World began to &s;ee with o|ther Eyes; the <HI>Devil</HI> lo&s;t Ground every where, and the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;pread it &s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly, and in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, e&s;pecially over all the Ea&s;tern and Northern Parts, as into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France</HI>; and now it behoved the <HI>Devil</HI> to take new Mea&s;ures al&s;o.</P>
<P>Nor was he at all at a Lo&s;s, for he knew his Method pre&s;ently, and that was to put on the Face of Religion, rank in with the &s;anctifyed Part of the People, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Clergy, and draw them into his Scheme, as he had done the Pagan Prie&s;ts before.</P>
<P>Upon this he took up the Ton&s;ure, &s;haved him|&s;elf for a Monk, or a Monkey, which you plea&s;e, dre&s;s'd him&s;elf up in the Habit, put on the &s;acred Ve&s;tments, and got pre&s;ently into Orders. The Popes quickly fell in with him: Pope <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> II. gave him In&s;titution and Induction, and from this time for|ward he quitted the A&s;trologick, and &s;et up an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic <HI>Magick</HI> in the World: The Succe&s;s

has been wonderful, beyond even his own Expecta|tion; for it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, when the Prie&s;ts fir&s;t began a Corre&s;pondence with him, they out-&s;tript him in their Speed, for they run even before they were &s;ent. St. <HI>Francis</HI> and St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> out-did all the Arts of infernal Magick that ever were known, or in u&s;e in the World, and with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance did more to e&s;tabli&s;h a Race of Inchanters and Church Magicians in the World, than the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf could have expected.</P>
<P>This &s;erved his Intere&s;t effectually on one Side of the World, that is to &s;ay, for <HI>Europe</HI> e&s;pecially, and all the We&s;tern World: And <HI>Confucius</HI> drew out another Plan of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick or rather Philo|&s;ophick <HI>Magick</HI> for him in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> But he was &s;till at a Lo&s;s for all the re&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> which we might then call the middle Part of the World; and which at that time was ripe for any kinds of Enthu&s;ia&s;m or Church Magick, let it be almo&s;t what it would.</P>
<P><HI>Satan,</HI> who always &s;ees his Opportunity, and has no want of Vigilance to lay hold of it, &s;aw the Occa&s;ion, but could not readily find out a Handle. He could not pre&s;ently think of a Method, 'till at length the indu&s;trious <HI>Devil</HI> found out the Contri|vance of &s;etting up the Unity again&s;t the Trinity, the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> the Race of the Bond-woman again&s;t the Race of the Free-woman; the Circumci&s;ion again&s;t the Bap|ti&s;m; and the Magick of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Pidgeon to mi|mick the Chri&s;tian Dove.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled the Scheme, he found out a Tool fit for his Purpo&s;e; a fierce ignorant <HI>Arabian,</HI> bold, &s;ubtle, cruel, and mercile&s;s; to Men in&s;olent, and audacious to Heaven; who by this meer Ma|gick of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, back'd by the Sword and Spear, &s;et up the bolde&s;t, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s of all Impo&s;tures that ever was in the

<P>Such is the Force of Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Magick, and how far it is gone be&s;ides this to break into the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tic Affairs of the Chri&s;tian World, is not hard to de&s;cribe, tho' it would take up too much Room, e&s;pecially at the Clo&s;e of this Work, to enquire into the Particulars.</P>
<P>What a continued Series of Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Magick has been acted among the Romi&s;h Clergy, and in the whole Papal Hierarchy! Even Popery it&s;elf &s;eems to me to be one entire Sy&s;tem of Antechri|&s;tian Magick; its Con&s;titutions are all Sorcery and Witchcraft; they prevail upon Sen&s;e by Non&s;en&s;e, upon the Head by the Tail, upon Zeal by Enthu|&s;ia&s;m; and upon the Chri&s;tian Doctrine by the Do|ctrine of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>How could it be po&s;&s;ible that Mankind, blinded by their own Ob&s;tinacy, could &s;ink their Rea&s;on to erect Notion; e&s;tabli&s;h Fraud and Cheat, again&s;t Chri&s;tian Sincerity and Plainne&s;s; make Men re|fu&s;e to &s;ee when their Eyes are open; wor&s;hip Prie&s;ts in the Name of God, and &s;et up Darkne&s;s in the room of Light; if they were not bewitched with the Magick of Hell, and under the entire Management of the <HI>Devil?</HI></P>
<P>It would be worth while here to draw a Table of Proportions, and let us &s;ee how much more fatal to the World this Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Magick of Po|pery, inclu&s;ive of a few other &s;piritual Delu&s;ions and Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, has been, than all the Magick of Pagani&s;m, and all the Conjurations of Hell were before.</P>

<P>But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve one thing here, which is nece&s;&s;ary to your Illumination, and tho' it &s;hould bring me back and draw me in again to the Sin of Gravity, which the Town hates; yet ven|turing the general Di&s;plea&s;ure, I &s;ay 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to take Notice here, that the&s;e religious <HI>Effluvia</HI> of Hell, which at pre&s;ent make &s;uch Confu&s;ion of Principles among us, are &s;o demon&s;trably embrac'd by the pre&s;ent <HI>Magi,</HI> the Sages, the Conver&s;ers
<PB N="355" REF="376">
with good Spirits, the <HI>Ro&s;icrucians,</HI> and Ma&s;ters of the Occult Sciences, and all the other Preten|ders to Supernaturals, and &s;ecret Illuminations; that they leave us no more room to doubt but they are all Natives of the &s;ame Climate, bred up in the &s;ame Country, carrying on the &s;ame Intere&s;t, and will &s;hare at la&s;t in the &s;ame De&s;truction; when the Tares and the Wheat &s;hall be skilfully and criti|cally &s;eparated, as we are well a&s;&s;ur'd they will be.</P>
<P>This indeed &s;tands fair again&s;t all the modern Teachers of the <HI>Ro&s;icrucian</HI> Whim&s;ies, and the Doctrine of Spirits, <HI>viz.</HI> that None of them apply to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of true Religion. On the contrary, they e&s;tabli&s;h, or &s;trive to e&s;tabli&s;h, old Errors, and continually broach new; they preach another Doctrine, and their Notions, were they not expos'd by their own Extravagancies, and En|thu&s;ia&s;tic Brains, would expo&s;e them&s;elves, being a kind of religious Ramble, a confus'd and a con|founding Heap of Non&s;en&s;e: The poor People would otherwi&s;e be in Danger of being wheedled into their Delu&s;ions, but this unravels all their dark Schemes, and tends to &s;how us the Cheat of all the re&s;t, and to convince us that 'tis all a Black Art, all a Diabolick, a meer Emanation of Hell.</P>
<P>Thus all their <HI>Magick</HI> detects and expo&s;es it &s;elf, all the high and blu&s;tring Bomba&s;t of Sacred, Di|vine, Excellent, and &s;uch like, di&s;cover whence they come; the Pretences to Illuminations, Com|munication, or Intercour&s;e with Spirits, and an invi|&s;ible World, appear to be Pretences, and no more; Their Dreams of <HI>Aerial</HI> Sub&s;tances and Spirituous Bo|dies, the Inhabitants of the Elements, the refin'd incor|poreal E&s;&s;ences; their Ab&s;tracts of Quinte&s;&s;ence, and a thou&s;and more which they put upon the World; I &s;ay, they all &s;mell of the Fire and Brim&s;tone, are born of Hell, their invi&s;ible World is evidently to be under&s;tood the Infernal World, and their Study of

the Sacred Sciences, is neither more or le&s;s, to &s;peak in the common Dialect, than dealing with the <HI>Devil</HI>; there it begins, and there it mu&s;t and will end.</P>
<P>What el&s;e means their Philo&s;ophick Cant of mingling the &s;upernatural E&s;&s;ences, their confound|ing the Terms of Religion and things Divine, with the Dreams and the Jargon of their un&s;igni|fying Language? loo&s;ing the Name of GOD, <HI>De|vil,</HI> HEAVEN, <HI>Hell,</HI> in the Cant of their Trade, and the labour'd Expre&s;&s;ions of &s;acred Flame, men|tal Fire, immortal Spirit, Perfection, Corruption, illuminating Genius, and a va&s;t Throng of Words, tending to amu&s;e the Fooli&s;h, and di&s;tract the Wi&s;e; tending to de&s;troy Religion and all the &s;olid E&s;tabli&s;hment of Heaven, whether for the Fe|licity of the Ju&s;t, or Puni&s;hment of the Wicked?</P>
<P>Had their Magick any Tokens of a truly Divine In&s;titution, of a heavenly Original, and was this de|mon&s;trated by its confirming, and conforming to the Principles of either Natural or Reveal'd Religion, &s;omething might be &s;aid for it; or was its Tendency to e&s;tabli&s;h, not bewilder the Under&s;tanding, and to fix the Knowledge of the true God in the Minds of Men; was it qualify'd to e&s;tabli&s;h our Faith in divine Illuminations, and truly to direct our Wor&s;hip and Homage to Him, encouraging at the &s;ame time Peace, Ju&s;tice, Humility, and every Chri&s;tian Virtue; Were this the Ca&s;e, we &s;hould not di&s;pute with them the Conver&s;e of Spirits between us and the invi&s;ible World, the Spirits uncas'd and fled from hence, with the Spirits yet embodyed, by an invi&s;ible and inconceivable Communication.

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Magick</HI> of the pre&s;ent Time, as it &s;tands &s;trip'd in the la&s;t <HI>Chapter,</HI> from all the Pretences of the <HI>Magicians,</HI> and the De|lu&s;ions of <HI>Hell;</HI> of what Length it has gone, <HI>or</HI> is like to go, <HI>in</HI> deluding Mankind; what the <HI>Magicians</HI> can do, and that they really have now no Conver&s;e with the <HI>Devil</HI> at all: So that the Art being at an End, the Hi&s;tory comes to an End of cour&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING, in the la&s;t Chapter, brought down this Idol call'd Magick to its true Original, &s;trip'd it of all the Ma&s;querade Dre&s;&s;es, je&s;ted a little about it, and at la&s;t laid the Ba&s;tard at the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Door, who is the true Father of it; One would think &s;o Bare-fac'd an Impo&s;ture &s;hould be able to appear no longer in the World, that it would be hi&s;s'd off the Stage, and that the very Boys and Girls would throw Stones and Dirt at it in the Street.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, and in &s;pight of Contradiction the <HI>Devil</HI> goes on his own way; if this or that Nation, or Country, or People drop him, and refu&s;e him, he goes to another; like a true Pedlar, if he is an&s;wer'd No at one Door, he knocks at the next. If he &s;ells Counterfeits, and is call'd Cheating Knave at one Hou&s;e, he calls him|&s;elf hone&s;t Man at another. The <HI>Devil</HI> is never baulk'd, but carries on his Game, in &s;pight of all the Repul&s;es he meets with, nay in &s;pite of Heaven i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he is never at a lo&s;s for Di&s;gui&s;es, and like a Lady at the Ball, if &s;he happens to have been known in her Ma&s;querade Habit Ye&s;terday, to-morrow
<PB N="358" REF="379">
&s;he gets another that &s;hall be a more per|fect Di&s;gui&s;e. If he happens to be blown here, he is conceal'd there. If he is di&s;cover'd and known for a <HI>Devil</HI> to-day, you &s;hall mi&s;take him again, and take him for a Saint or <HI>Magician</HI> of another kind to-morrow.</P>
<P>Nay, and after all, even where he is known to be the <HI>Devil,</HI> and finds he cannot be di&s;guis'd any longer; yet he has his ways with him, to win and plea&s;e you, and draw you in, at lea&s;t to bear with him, &s;eeing he does you no harm. Thus, do you not &s;ee the Crowd about the Puppet-Show, and do they not laugh, and halloo, and appear infinitely pleas'd with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and &s;imple&s;t of all Cheats; and that tho' they know them to be Cheats and Delu&s;ions, and that they are but meer Puppets?</P>
<P>So our <HI>Magicians,</HI> tho' you know them to be Cheats, tho' you know that notwith&s;tanding all their Pretences, they really deal with the <HI>Devil</HI>; yet we have People among us that would be con|tent, and deal with them upon that very Score. I want to know, &s;ays the jealous-headed Country|man, who has made me a Cuckold, and don't tell me of the Cunning Man going to the <HI>Devil</HI> for In|formation. Why, I'd go to the <HI>Devil</HI> my &s;elf, if I knew where he was, rather than not find it out.</P>
<P>Nay, tho' you convince them, that even in the wor&s;t of it all, the Fellow is not &s;o wicked as they think he is, or as he makes of him&s;elf, that he knows nothing of the <HI>Devil</HI> any more than they do, but only cheats them, and per&s;wades them to believe he knows &s;omething, when indeed he knows nothing of the matter, yet &s;till they will go to him; Such an old Woman, or &s;uch a young Fool, told 'em, that they had been with the Cun|ning Man, and they will go too; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade them again&s;t it, till they have thrown their Money away, and come back a&s;ham'd.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="380">So that the Delu&s;ion &s;till goes on. A young Girl has two Sweet-hearts, and &s;he goes to the Cun|ning Man to know which of tho&s;e two &s;hall have her. A young Fellow has lo&s;t his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and mu&s;t know who Courts her. Another has lo&s;t a Cow, and away he goes to the Cunning Man to know who has &s;tole her. The crafty Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, like the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Oracles of old, gives doubtful An|&s;wers, &s;atisfies no Body, and yet plea&s;es every Body. He &s;ends the Girl home with an old Wife's Tale; bids her lay two Sticks a-cro&s;s under her Pillow, and the fir&s;t &s;he dreams on will be the Man. The poor Girl's Head runs upon the Affair of a Husband, 'tis no wonder &s;he &s;hould dream of one of them, and it may be the right, as well the wrong, &s;o that 'tis an even Lay. But the Con|jurer is right; and to be once right, &s;ecures him the Cu&s;tom of all the young People in the Country; whereas, if he is out, that's forgotten, and does him no Harm.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Devil</HI>'s low-priz'd Game, and he carries it on a great way; and as the Mountebank oftentimes gets more Money than a licen&s;ed Phy|&s;ician, and the Quack than the Doctor; &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> gets more Clients than the Coun&s;ellor, and his Agents have as much Practice as the Lawyers, and perhaps upon as hone&s;t a foot too as &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould enquire a little here, and expo&s;e the weak Doings of tho&s;e Cunning Men, and how they delude the poor People; but 'tis of no great U&s;e. For as 'tis one of the &s;imple&s;t things of its kind in the World, and by which the poor Peo|ple are the mo&s;t impos'd upon, yet 'tis perhaps one of the la&s;t Delu&s;ions in the World that they will be cur'd of; nor can all the Cunning Men of a higher Kind in the whole World rea&s;on them out of it. They will leave the Surgeon for the Moun|tebank,
<PB N="360" REF="381">
the Phy&s;ician for the Quack, the Par&s;on for the Conjurer, and God for the <HI>Devil.</HI> A few &s;hort Tales upon this Part may perhaps illu&s;trate the Speculation, and &s;how you the Force of Fraud, tho' I doubt it will not do much towards a Cure.</P>
<P>A <HI>Magician</HI> giving out his Bills, and boa&s;ting of his mighty Perfomances, went down in the way of his Calling, as other Trade&s;men do, to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Fair, and there he did Wonders, told Fortunes, calcu|lated Nativities, look'd in the Girls Hands, peep'd in their Eyes, talk'd broad things to them to make them blu&s;h; and then gue&s;&s;ing from their Colour how things &s;tood with them, and by a thou&s;and cro&s;s Que&s;tions, fir&s;t crept into their Ca&s;es, and then told them for a mighty Di&s;covery, what they had di&s;cover'd to him with their own fooli&s;h Tongues that very Minute.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the young La&s;&s;es that came to him with their Grievances, there comes one with that laudable Que&s;tion; <HI>if in Love,</HI> whether <HI>I &s;hall marry the Man or no?</HI> She was &s;o Mode&s;t that &s;he could not tell the Doctor her Ca&s;e her &s;elf, but &s;he brings it him in Writing; and in|&s;tead of &s;tating the Que&s;tion as above, <HI>If in Love,</HI> &s;he had written it, <HI>if Courted.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor (for they are all <HI>Doctors</HI>) looks upon the Paper, and &s;eeing it a Woman's Hand; 'Tis your own Writing, Child, &s;ays he, I &s;uppo&s;e, you would not tru&s;t any body el&s;e with it; &s;he curti&s;y'd, and &s;aid <HI>Yes</HI>: &s;o he reads it out, <HI>If in Love,</HI> whether the Man <HI>will marry me</HI> or <HI>no?</HI> The Girl colour'd and &s;aid, 'tis not &s;o, you don't read it right, Sir.

<PB N="361" REF="382">
Chair, I'll tell thee a Story: &s;o the Girl, after a few Curte&s;ies and &s;light Refu&s;es, &s;its down; and the Do|ctor begins his Story: There was, &s;ays he, a young Woman, a very pretty cleaver Girl, as you are, my Dear, (and with that he feels her Pul&s;e again) came to me t'other Day ju&s;t with &s;uch a Que&s;tion as this, and after I had a little Talk with her, and feeling her Pul&s;e, as I do yours, my Dear, (and then he felt her Pul&s;e again, and &s;tarted again <HI>Ha,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>'tis &s;o indeed,</HI> and then goes on) I by the Help of my Art, which is the mo&s;t certain Line for the Di&s;covery of hidden Truth directed by Nature, and by the Intercour&s;e of invi&s;ible Beings, which inform me of every thing proper to be known, and for the Service of tho&s;e who come to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with my exalted Genius, I &s;ay by my infallible Judgment I found the poor Girl had concealed &s;omething from me, which indeed &s;he ought not to have done.</P>
<P>For by giving me a wrong Account of her Ca&s;e, how &s;hould I give a direct An&s;wer? were it not that I, who am a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the good Spirits, the Inhabi|tants of the &s;uperior World, am not to be deceived.</P>
<P>So I &s;aid to her, Sweet-heart, thou ha&s;t con|cealed the chief Part of thy Ca&s;e; is there not &s;omething more in this Que&s;tion than thou ha&s;t acknowledg'd? She made me no An&s;wer at fir&s;t, till I being illuminated by the bright Spirit of the fifth Region of <HI>Alahamed irwi&s;hah,</HI> and by all the a&s;&s;i&s;ting Lights of the high exalted Atmo&s;phere, (Here the Doctor run over a great many <HI>Greek</HI> Words, which almo&s;t frighted the poor Girl whom he held fa&s;t by the Hand or Wri&s;t all the while) I, &s;aid he, that could not be deceived, told her in plain Words, Why thou ha&s;t concealed from me that thou art with Child; at which, continues he, the guilty poor Girl having nothing to &s;ay, and be|ing not able to deny what &s;he found was reveal'd to me by my never-failing Intelligence, confe&s;s'd
<PB N="362" REF="383">
to me, that it was &s;o; and I having Compa&s;&s;ion for her Circum&s;tances (for &s;he had been deluded) pro|mis'd her my powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance to bring the Knave to marry her, which is now happily done to her in|finite Satisfaction. All this while he held her by the Wri&s;t, and look'd frequently in her Face.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t he di&s;cern'd an unu&s;ual Fluttering and &s;udden Di&s;order in her Pul&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the Story being well enough told, and the fir&s;t Girl's Behaviour mimick'd to the Life; by looking in her Face, he &s;aw her Colour come and go; and when he talked of his knowing every thing from the &s;uperior Beings and the invi&s;ible Word, he &s;aw &s;he was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now my Dear, &s;ays the Doctor, rai&s;ing her by the Hand out of the Chair, give me Leave to look a little farther; &s;o leading her to the Window, he gently lifted up one of her Eye-lids, then he gave two Hums and &s;aid, <HI>Pretty well there.</HI> The Girl all the while blu&s;ht and colour'd, and chang'd now red, and then pale; a little Conjuration indeed would tell the Doctor how it was with her.</P>
<P>Now, my Dear, &s;ays he to the Girl, you would do well to be &s;o free with me as to let me know your whole Ca&s;e, if you think fit to tru&s;t me with it, and for that, I am as &s;ecret as Death; you need not be under the lea&s;t Concern about that, for 'tis my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I am tru&s;ted with the Secrets of Princes, and am a Coun&s;ellor of Coun&s;ellors; and if I &s;hould betray any body, it would be a double Offence, neither would the invi&s;ible Spirits com|municate the Secrets of People's Affairs to me if they did not judge me faithful, therefore you may tru&s;t me with the utmo&s;t Safety, Child, adds he, I &s;hall never divulge any thing that you commit to me.</P>
<P>The Girl was as mute as a Fi&s;h, and &s;aid not one Word to him, but blu&s;h'd and colour'd as red as the Gills of a Turkey-Cock when he is angry.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="384">Come, my Dear, &s;ays he, perhaps you can't ex|pre&s;s your &s;elf freely, &s;o I won't pre&s;s you any far|ther; but &s;it down till I con&s;ult the good Spirits again, who, as I told thee, are always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Innocence; and who will not fail to give me a full Information of your Ca&s;e, and Directions al&s;o for your Good; &s;o that I do not need you &s;hould make any kind of Confe&s;&s;ion of your Ca&s;e to me. I &s;hall be able pre&s;ently to tell it you di|rectly without your Help; &s;o pray &s;it but two or three Minutes, and I'll come to you again.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this to her, he offer'd to go away, at which the Girl fell a crying vehemently; and the Doctor, too cunning not to take hold of it, and &s;atisfied that he had hit the Mark, &s;topt, and came back to her: Well, my Dear, &s;ays he, I &s;ee how 'tis, and I had partly Intelligence of it before, as you may ea&s;ily perceive; But, come Child, adds he, let's &s;ee, what is to be done for thee? She cried all the while; but when he &s;aid, What's to be done, &s;he &s;aid, but could not &s;peak it plain for crying, <HI>That</HI> Thomas <HI>would</HI> &mdash; and there &s;he &s;topp'd. I under&s;tand thee Child, &s;ays he, that I &s;hould make <HI>Thomas</HI> marry thee, is it not? <HI>YES,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, and blubber'd <HI>mo&s;t &s;adly.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;ays the Doctor, but how far are you gone with Child? let me know that, and then I'll tell thee whether I can bring it to pa&s;s or no. With that he laid his Hand gently upon her Belly. I doubt thou art far gone, &s;ays he: About four Months, &s;ays the Girl. Well, Child, &s;ays he, come to me again To-morrow in the Afternoon, and I'll tell thee what is re&s;olved in thy Ca&s;e by the Powers who a&s;&s;i&s;t my never-failing Art. So taking a Crown of the Poor Girl for letting him pump the Truth out of her own Mouth, and getting the Reputation of a mo&s;t eminent Magician and Man of Art, he di&s;mi&s;s'd her for that time, letting her know
<PB N="364" REF="385">
that if he undertook to bring <HI>Thomas</HI> to marry her, he &s;hould expect a more con&s;iderable Acknow|ledgement.</P>
<P>In a word, he took <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Name, and where he liv'd, and found Ways to manage <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;o well, that <HI>Thomas</HI> came to him in two or three Days to get rid of a Gho&s;t, that haunted him. The Ca&s;e was this: The Doctor had an Implement which he carried with him upon the Occa&s;ion of his Bu|&s;ine&s;s; a &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, oily-tongu'd, young Fellow, who was a Jack-of-all-Trades, here he was a Juggler, there a Tumbler, To-day a Conjurer, at one time a Gho&s;t or Apparition, at another a <HI>Devil</HI> or Spirit, and &s;o acted all Shapes and Po&s;tures that could be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The Doctor having had his Intelligence from the Girl where <HI>Thomas</HI> liv'd, and finding very happily that he lodg'd in a publick Hou&s;e not far off, being Servant to a Trade&s;man, who not having Room for him in his Hou&s;e, paid for a Lodging for him in the Ale-hou&s;e; I &s;ay, having gotten this Handle, he &s;ends his Ingineer to lodge in the &s;ame Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Fellow finds an Opportunity to come &s;o far acquainted with <HI>Thomas,</HI> as always to know whither he went, and upon what Errands and Bu|&s;ine&s;s: and the fir&s;t Time that <HI>Thomas</HI> was &s;ent of an Errand (very happily for him) was to a Vil|lage, about a Mile out of the City, and in the Evening.</P>
<P>As <HI>Thomas</HI> was going to this Village, this &s;ubtle Rogue gets behind a Wall in his Way, and with a hollow dead kind of Voice calls him three times by his Name; and immediately convey'd him&s;elf away into a Field of Corn, where, had <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;u|&s;pected him, he could not have found him; and get|ting out of the Corn, he runs round by another Way, and puts him&s;elf ju&s;t in the Way that <HI>Thomas</HI>

<P>And was it very loud and di&s;tinct? <HI>&s;ays George.</HI> Are you &s;ure you are not deceived? for &s;ometimes People fancy Voices when there are none.</P>
<P>Ay, that may be, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> but I an't &s;o fancy|ful; I am very &s;ure I heard it three Times; it call'd my Chri&s;tian Name and Sirname, <HI>Thomas</HI> fir&s;t, then <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Saunders</HI> again; 'twas a <HI>Devil</HI>'s Voice to be &s;ure, 'twas har&s;h and hollow as the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I don't like it, I confe&s;s, <HI>&s;ays George</HI>; it &s;eems to &s;ignify Death when People are called &s;o, and it may be in three Days, three Weeks, or three Months, or three Years.</P>
<P>Can't you tell me which? <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>No really, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> I can't go &s;o far as that. If my Ma&s;ter was to know the Ca&s;e, he would tell you exactly; but I dare &s;ay 'tis Death, or &s;omething very bad.</P>
<P>They had not gone far after this, but <HI>George</HI> watching a convenient Place, gives a little Start, and &s;tops, looking as if he &s;aw &s;omething: Hold a little, &s;ays he to <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>What's the matter? <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>Matter, <HI>&s;ays George</HI>; Nay you be&s;t know what's the matter; have you committed Murther, <HI>Thomas</HI>? have you kill'd any body?</P>
<P>I kill'd any body! Mercy upon me! <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> what do you mean?</P>
<P>Why, do you &s;ee nothing, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> do ye &s;ee nothing * there?</P>
<P><HI>He points to a great Tree which &s;tood on the Com|mon which they were going over.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="388">No, not I, <HI>&s;ays Thomas</HI>; don't fright me; you know, <HI>George,</HI> I am frighted enough already.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> I don't de&s;ire to fright you, <HI>Thomas</HI>; but you would be wor&s;e frighted than I if you &s;aw it; I'm glad you don't.</P>
<P>But what is it? <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI> Dear <HI>George,</HI> tell me, is it the <HI>Devil?</HI></P>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> not the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;ays <HI>George,</HI> but 'tis a Spi|rit, 'tis a Gho&s;t to be &s;ure; that made me ask if you had kill'd any body.</P>
<P>Well, I &s;hall die, <HI>&s;ays Thomas</HI>; I'm e'en dead with the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight; Why how &s;hould you &s;ee it and not I, <HI>George?</HI></P>
<P>O, there's a Rea&s;on for that, <HI>&s;ays George</HI>; my Ma|&s;ter gave me a particular Sight; that I can &s;ee Ap|paritions when others can't, it belongs to our Bu|&s;ine&s;s; but you'll &s;ee it pre&s;ently, for it will come nearer, I &s;ee that.</P>
<P>O, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> what &s;hall I do, <HI>George?</HI> will it &s;peak to me?</P>
<P>I don't know yet, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> it may be not, I'll tell you pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>They continued going forward all this while, and began to come pretty near the Town; when by-and-by, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> I don't know what to think of it, <HI>Thomas</HI>; it threatens and makes Signs as if it would come up to you and &s;trike you.</P>
<P>Strike me! <HI>&s;ays Thomas:</HI> nay then 'twill kill me to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>No, no, they never kill any body; be&s;ides, I &s;ee you are in &s;uch a Fright, I'll &s;ee if I can &s;peak to it, and keep it off; if my Ma&s;ter were here, he'd &s;end it away with a Word &s;peaking. With that <HI>George</HI> goes three Steps forward; bids <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;tand &s;till, draws a Circle with his Stick upon the Ground, and puts <HI>Thomas</HI> into it: Stand there, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> and you &s;hall be &s;afe, and don't be afraid, I'll &s;ee what I can do for thee.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="389"><HI>Thomas</HI> &s;tands &s;till as he was bid, but quaking and trembling in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; and <HI>George</HI> goes forward a little out of the Way and talks aloud, but &s;o that <HI>Thomas</HI> could hear only the Voice, not under&s;tand the Words; and <HI>George</HI> makes a great many Motions and Cro&s;&s;es in the Air, and this he held a good while, when he comes back to <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>Thomas, &s;ays he,</HI> I believe I have deliver'd you for this time, but &s;omething is the matter; this Apparition threatens you &s;trangely; I fancy you'll hear of it again.</P>
<P>But is it gone now? <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>Stand &s;till, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> a little, I think 'tis a going.</P>
<P>So <HI>George</HI> and he &s;tand &s;till a little: Ay, there, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> it goes off that Way (pointing North) and now 'tis gone up in the Air, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> come now we'll go on. So away they went to the Town, and <HI>George</HI> tells him he mu&s;t take his Leave of him, and run home as hard as he can drive.</P>
<P>Dear <HI>George, &s;ays Thomas,</HI> don't leave me; why, I could not go back in the dark if you would give me a thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>I can't po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay, <HI>&s;ays George</HI>; if you are &s;o frighted, you had be&s;t lie there all Night, and come Home in the Morning.</P>
<P>I dare not do that neither, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> my Ma|&s;ter will be &s;o angry, 'tis as much as my Place is worth.</P>
<P>Why then you mu&s;t get &s;omebody to come with you at the Town, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> for indeed I can't &s;tay now. So away comes <HI>George</HI> and leaves him, and &s;ets up a Run, as if he was bound to be back again with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>When <HI>George</HI> had got away and was out of &s;ight, he alter'd him&s;elf, as he knew very well how to do by his Skill in Po&s;tures and Tumbling, which, <HI>as before,</HI> was a Part of his Trade; and having a linnen Habit in his great Pocket, dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf up in the
<PB N="369" REF="390">
Habit of a Gho&s;t or an Apparition, not in a Shrowd like a dead Body, but all in white, down to the Feet, and a Woman's Head-dre&s;s upon his Head; and in this Po&s;ture he places him&s;elf where he knew <HI>Thomas</HI> would come. But before this, covering his Habit with his great Coat, he plac'd him&s;elf at the Village in &s;ight of the Door where <HI>Thomas</HI> went in, that he might be &s;ure to know when he came out, and which Way he went, le&s;t he &s;hould take &s;ome other Way; and al&s;o to know who and how many he got to come with him.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found <HI>Thomas</HI> on his Way, for he came out of the Hou&s;e and two Fellows with him in about an Hour: So <HI>George</HI> follow'd 'em at a di|&s;tance, 'till he &s;aw them in a little Lane leading into the Common as before, and when he knew they could go no other Way; upon which, he run by another Way over the Fields, and got into the Common before them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he did was to get into a little Thicket, where lying flat on the Ground, and out of Sight, he lay and hi&s;s'd like a Serpent mo&s;t frightfully; This had its immediate Effect, for it frighted them all, and he heard one of them &s;ay, It was the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that he was come for <HI>Thomas</HI> to be &s;ure: and the other &s;aid &s;o too, adding that he would go no further; this was enough for <HI>George,</HI> for by this he knew they were no Champions that <HI>Thomas</HI> had brought along with him; &s;o removing and getting to another Place a little behind them, that they might not run back again, there he chang'd his Note, and then growl'd like a great Dog, and that frighted them again. Now having made this Beginning, he leaves off a little, and goes into the Common, and &s;tands in the middle of the Road ju&s;t where the Lane open'd into the Heath; &s;o that he might be &s;ure to be &s;een all in white, a little be|fore they came out of the Lane.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="391">The Night was not very dark, but no Moon|light; &s;ome Stars, not many, were &s;een; when co|ming to the Lane's end, they &s;aw the Spectre, and no &s;ooner &s;aw it, but all three run away and cry'd out mo&s;t terribly. <HI>George</HI> had now his End, for he didn't de&s;ire to carry it on any farther; &s;o he kept his Po&s;t 'till he found by their Noi&s;e they cro&s;s'd the Common farther off and out of Sight; then he put off his Habit, and made the be&s;t of his Way to their Lodging; where when <HI>Thomas</HI> came, he found <HI>George</HI> very &s;edately &s;tanding at the Door &s;moaking his Pipe.</P>
<P>He bad <HI>Thomas</HI> well-come Home, but &s;aid no more, not taking the lea&s;t notice of any thing; but found that <HI>Thomas</HI> went immediately up Stairs, and threw him&s;elf down upon the Bed; and the next Morning <HI>Thomas</HI> was very &s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> in the mean time went home to his Ma|&s;ter, and gave him an Accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the whole Tran&s;|action, who finding his Engines work to his Mind, gave <HI>George</HI> farther In&s;tructions; which were in &s;hort, to haunt the poor Fellow Night and Day, and give him no Quiet, 'till he had manag'd him up to a Nece&s;&s;ity of coming to him (the <HI>Doctor</HI>) for Help, which was not long fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved that the Doctor or Cun|ning Man finding he &s;hould compa&s;s his Ends upon <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;ent now for the poor Girl, and told her, that he had employed the utmo&s;t of his Art and Skill in her Behalf; And upon my Word, adds he, my Child, I have had a fatherly Concern for you; and I have engaged &s;o many of the good Spirits of the &s;uperior Regions in your Favour, that they (always ready to do Acts of Beneficence and Kindne&s;s to di&s;tre&s;s'd Mortals) have a&s;&s;ured me that <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;hall marry you; ay, and &s;hall come and court you to have him too, as much as if he had not gotten this unju&s;t Advantage of you, or he
<PB N="371" REF="392">
&s;hall have no Re&s;t in this Life, nay he &s;hall have no Re&s;t in this Life 'till he does.</P>
<P>The poor Girl <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mil'd, and was mightily pleas'd, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, and puts her Hand in her Pocket, and gives the Doctor half a Guinea for the good News. The Doctor took the Money, but told her mode&s;tly, that if he did her &s;uch a great piece of Service as this, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> She under&s;tood him, and told him, &s;he had not a great deal of Money, but yet &s;he had a rich Aunt, and other good Friends; and <HI>Thomas</HI> need not ha' us'd her &s;o; for, that if&mdash;and then &s;he cry'd again, &s;he would have &s;corn'd to ha' marry'd him, but&mdash;I under&s;tand you, Child, &s;ays the Doctor; now you mu&s;t not only take him, but mu&s;t be glad he will take you? Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> and does your Aunt know this unlucky Story?</P>
<P>Yes Sir, &s;ays the Girl, and &s;he bid me tell you, &s;he will make a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent to you, if you can bring it about.</P>
<P>Well Child, &s;ays the Doctor, tell your Aunt, I will undertake to do it, if &s;he will be as good as her Word.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he will, Sir. I will bring it you, &s;ays &s;he; and nam'd the Sum, which was no le&s;s than twenty Pounds; and the Doctor, with an unu&s;ual Mode&s;ty, not craving any more, told her generou&s;ly, that if he fail'd, he would have nothing more than &s;he had given him already.</P>
<P>This Treaty took up two or three Days, and in the mean time <HI>George</HI> haunted <HI>Thomas,</HI> upon &s;eve|ral Occa&s;ions: Nay, he could hardly &s;tir out of Doors in the Night, but he &s;how'd him&s;elf, &s;ome|times all in White, &s;ometimes all in Black; till at la&s;t <HI>Thomas</HI> comes to him one Evening: <HI>George, &s;ays he,</HI> dear <HI>George,</HI> if you don't help me, I know not what to do. I am harra&s;s'd out of my Wits.
<PB N="372" REF="393">
This <HI>Devil,</HI> if it is the <HI>Devil,</HI> haunts me &s;o, that it gives me no Re&s;t. La&s;t Night it call'd me again three times at my Chamber Window, the very &s;ame Voice, and three times over, ju&s;t as it did at the long Wall.</P>
<P>N.B. George <HI>had cunningly got a Ladder in the Night, and &s;et it up to the Fellow's Window, and went up, and call'd him aloud, with the &s;ame hollow dead Sound, as he did before.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> I am &s;orry for it, <HI>Thomas</HI>; I would have you &s;end for a Mini&s;ter, and prepare for another World, for I doubt you are not very long for this World.</P>
<P>But did not you tell me, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> your Ma&s;ter could do &s;omething for me?</P>
<P>Yes indeed, <HI>&s;ays George,</HI> I did &s;o; and I believe he could, if you han't let it run too far, and if you han't done &s;ome &s;ad thing, <HI>Thomas</HI>; For the Spi|rits of the invi&s;ible World, which my Ma&s;ter knows and conver&s;es with, are all good Spirits, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and they will do no nothing for you, adds he, if you have committed Murder or Robbery, or any &s;uch thing; and therefore if that be your Ca&s;e, do not let me carry you to my Ma&s;ter, for he can do you no good.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> &s;tar'd as if he had been bewitch'd. <HI>Mer|cy upon me!</HI> what do you mean, <HI>Brother George, &s;ays he,</HI> I am as Innocent as the Child unborn. I never did any &s;uch thing in my Life.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;ays <HI>George,</HI> if you &s;peak hone&s;tly, I'll let my Ma&s;ter know your Ca&s;e, and if you will come to our Office to-morrrow Morning, you &s;hall have his An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Good George, &s;ays Thomas,</HI> don't put it off till to-morrow; what &s;hall I do? <HI>Why George,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> will murder me to-night.</P>
<P>What would you have me do? <HI>&s;ays George.</HI> I'll go immediately, if you will, but I doubt he is not at home.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="394">However, <HI>Thomas</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him, away they go to the Doctor together; which was indeed what <HI>George</HI> wanted.

<P>But, &s;ays the Doctor, (ju&s;t as <HI>George</HI> had been taught to do before) I fear this Man has commit|ted &s;ome flagrant Crime, and &s;o the evil Sprits have a right to pur&s;ue him.

<P>Well, pull of thy Glove, &s;ays the Doctor.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> you may &s;ee I an't burnt in the Hand.</P>
<P>Pr'ythee, young Man, &s;ays the Doctor, I don't look for that; &s;o he examines his Palm. Well, &s;ays the Doctor, all's <HI>well here.</HI> Nor you have com|mitted no Robbery or Felony? don't come to me if you are Guilty of any &s;uch Crimes as you ought to be hang'd for.</P>
<P>No, indeed, I han't, and't plea&s;e you, <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI></P>

for you; &s;o you had better let me know it before|hand.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, and plea&s;e you, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> I have never done any &s;uch thing in my Life.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou ever done any Injury, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> to any, for which thou can'&s;t be thus plagu'd?</P>
<P>No indeed, Sir, not I, <HI>&s;ays Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>Well, Friend, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> I enquire for your Service only; for I don't care what you have done, nor do I care to know it. But let me ask you one Que&s;tion more, and then I &s;hall be able to &s;peak for you in general, as a very innocent, hone&s;t Per&s;on.

<P>Yes, Sir, with all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays Thomas</HI>; and Sir, adds he, I have never done any Hurt in all my Life.</P>
<P>All this while the Doctor holds him by the Hand, and every now and then feels his Pul&s;e.

<P>Now the Doctor had him fa&s;t. Well, is there any thing between you, is &s;he your Sweet-heart &s;till?</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="396">No, and't plea&s;e you, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> we have done.</P>
<P>Done! <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> What have you done? you han't lain with her, have you?

<P>Ay, but then, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> you &s;ay, if I don't tell you every thing fir&s;t, then I &s;hall get no Help afterwards?</P>
<P>That's very true, <HI>Thomas, &s;ays the Doctor gravely,</HI> I do &s;ay &s;o; and therefore, if you have any thing to tell me before I go, let me know it; but I don't oblige you to tell, you may do as you will; if you have any thing to &s;ay, tell me; if not, tell me.</P>
<P>Why, nothing, Sir, but about the Girl, a little.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>there now,</HI> I thought &s;o, when I felt your Pul&s;e: didn't I almo&s;t tell you &s;o? &s;ays the Doctor. I warrant you, ye have lain with the poor Girl now, and it may be got her with Child: is that it?</P>

And, <HI>be&s;ides Ma&s;ter, &s;ays Thomas,</HI> &s;he is a good hone&s;t Girl, and loves me too mainly, and &s;he'll be a good Wife: I'll e'en take her, Ma&s;ter, for better for wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Now you &s;peak hone&s;tly, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI> Now I like you, <HI>Thomas.</HI> I warrant you the <HI>Devil</HI> will haunt you no more, if you take her; but you have been but a kind of a Rogue to her before, I under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Doctor heartens him on, the young Fellow is ea&s;y, and the young Woman is &s;ent for; and in the Morning they were marry'd, and had a great Wedding-Dinner near the Doctor's Hou&s;e; &s;o that all was done to the Girl's Mind, and the Conjurer's too. For the Doctor had two Gunieas of <HI>Thomas,</HI> for delivering him from the <HI>Devil,</HI> (Who could do it cheaper!) and twenty of the good Wife's Friends, and the Lady that gave the Money thought it very well be|&s;tow'd.</P>
<P>This Management of the <HI>Magician,</HI> &s;erves to let you &s;ee, with what Art and Dexterity the&s;e Men play the Doctor with our ignorant People; and well they de&s;erve the Name of <HI>Cunning Men</HI>; and as this is the greate&s;t Part of the Magick they are Ma&s;ters of, &s;o this is the chief End and Aim of this Relation, to let the Reader into the Cheat of it. Here were two Fools manag'd by one cunning Knave; yet both of them are &s;erv'd. The Know|ledge of their Story, and the way to do them both Ju&s;tice, is pick'd out of their own Mouths; yet they are brought to do one another Ju&s;tice, and
<PB N="378" REF="399">
believe 'tis all done by the Magick of the Cunning Man; he gets their Money, and they come both off thankful into the Bargain. And here's not an Ounce of Magick in it all; here's no deal|ing with the <HI>Devil</HI> in all this. 'Tis nothing but a <HI>Bite,</HI> a kind of a Juggle; a <HI>Devil</HI> and no <HI>Devil,</HI> a Doctor no Conjurer, a Vi&s;ion without a Spirit, a Dance without a Fiddle; and in a word, here was Craft, but no Knavery neither: For what he did, ended in doing a poor injur'd Wench Ju&s;tice, and bringing a young impudent Fellow upon his Knees, making him take the Woman, not indeed for the Fear of God, but for Fear of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>This Account of the Doctor, or Cunning Man, may &s;tand upon Record, as a Specimen of the Ma|gick which we have now generally practis'd among us; or if you plea&s;e to take it as a Specimen of what is at pre&s;ent put upon the World for Magick. For as to the Real Black Art, or Dealing with the <HI>Devil</HI> by way of Compact, Intercour&s;e, Witchcraft, and &s;uch like, we find &s;o little of it left, that we have &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;ay 'tis quite out of U&s;e, and we have heard very little of it in this Part of the World for many Years.</P>
<P>Not that we are much better than our Ance&s;tors, nor have we &s;een any thing in the Manners of the People le&s;s addicted to Sorcery than formerly; but Cu&s;tom has made Men turn <HI>Magicians</HI> to them|&s;elves, we &s;eem to carry on our Corre&s;pondence with Hell &s;ingle handed, and by a kind of immedi|ate Intercour&s;e; &s;o that we want no more the Help of the <HI>Magician,</HI> whatever we do of the Magick. And here I think the Magick it &s;elf being as it were brought to a Conclu&s;ion, the Hi&s;tory of it is ju&s;tly at a Conclu&s;ion al&s;o. The Arts of Hell are now no more carry'd on by particular In&s;truments, and by way of Profe&s;&s;ion; the Black Art is at End; the <HI>Devil</HI> having no more need of the <HI>Magicians,</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="400">
has drop'd them, and manages his Affairs him&s;elf; and the <HI>Magicians</HI> having no other Acce&s;s to the <HI>Devil,</HI> than what is Imaginary, and carry'd on by meer Legerdemain, whatever it was formerly, their Number is decreas'd, and in a manner worn off by Time; &s;o that you have now nothing left but a few Jugglers, Cunning Men, Gyp&s;ies and Fortun-tellers. In &s;hort the Trade is decay'd, and we may &s;uppo&s;e the Managers of the Black Negotiation have turn'd their Hands to other Employments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI> by Magical Operations; whether the Magicians really have &s;uch a Power or no, and if they have, whether it is perform'd as an Art, and by the Con&s;e|quence of Magical Experiments, or whether it is by Concert and mutual Con&s;ent, be|tween <HI>Satan</HI> and the <HI>Magicians.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>RAi&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI> has been thought by &s;ome to be a Branch of <HI>Witchcraft</HI> rather than <HI>Ma|gick</HI>; and then it &s;hould not be mention'd in this Place; but the Point is not fully decided. It &s;eems both the Worthy Profe&s;&s;ions have pretended to it, and perhaps both have attain'd to practi&s;e it, and &s;o it may be reckon'd among the <HI>Occult Sciences,</HI> in common to the Practitioners of both Kinds, and then may be properly treated of in which part of our Undertaking we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is a kind of a vulgar Expre&s;&s;ion, and has not much Propriety in it, <HI>I mean that of rai&s;ing the Devil</HI>; for the <HI>Devil</HI> is not rais'd, he is rather brought down. As his Abode is expre&s;ly &s;aid to be in the
<PB N="380" REF="401">
upper Regions, and his Principality is in the Air, he is not fetch'd out of the Earth; and as &s;ome have thought with the &s;tamp of a Foot, as if he lodg'd under us, and we knock'd for him, as the &s;ick Body knocks upon the Floor for the Nur&s;e to come up Stairs, and &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>Satan certainly is not far out of Call, tho' 'tis &s;till &s;ometing doubtful in what particular Element he inhabits.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not in the Earth,</HI> (&s;ay I) becau&s;e then he would be impower'd to &s;hake the World with Earthquakes, overturn Cities and Towns, and give Mankind perpetual Di&s;turbances, and perhaps would be oblig'd to do &s;o as often as he mov'd from Place to Place. Nay, it would &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary that the Earth, notwith&s;tanding his &s;pirituous Nature, mu&s;t &s;uffer &s;ome Convul&s;ions, Di&s;locations, and Openings, or &s;ome or other Di&s;tortions, every time an old Woman had Occa&s;ion to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Not in the Sea:</HI> this is apparent by the <HI>Devils</HI> of <HI>Gadarene,</HI> who be&s;ought Chri&s;t not to &s;end them away into <HI>the Deep.</HI> It &s;eems they have an Aver&s;ion to the Water, and that therefore In&s;tinct led the Herd of Swine to run into the Sea, to deliver them&s;elves from the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing he would leave them when they came there. But the Hogs it &s;eems were not &s;agacious enough to find their Way out again, or to con&s;ider that before they went in. <HI>Luke</HI> viii.31, 33.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Not in the Fire</HI>; Becau&s;e that Element is ap|propriated for their final State, is to be their Pri|&s;on, and the Place of their Puni&s;hment; and as they have at pre&s;ent an Interval for Action, &s;o they mu&s;t have a Medium of Space for their Re&s;idence during the time of Action.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It mu&s;t</HI> then be <HI>in the Air,</HI> or airy Regions; and as we have rea&s;on to believe that they are not confin'd to the Atmo&s;phere of this Globe the
<PB N="381" REF="402">
Earth, which compar'd to them, their Numbers, and the Extent of their Operations, would be by much too narrow a Place for them, too much pre|&s;crib'd and limited, and give them no room for Action in proportion to them&s;elves; &s;o I am wil|ling to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow Satan to be in Capacity, (at lea&s;t able) to vi&s;it all the Atmo&s;pheres and Spaces in the im|men&s;e Wa&s;te, whether of habited, habitable, or uninhabited Bodies; and whether in tho&s;e we call Planets, or &s;uch Bodies as we have no Name for, becau&s;e no Knowledge of.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> cannot complain that I have not given him room enough, &s;ince I have deny'd his Locality to no Place but <HI>Heaven,</HI> where he cannot come, and perhaps does not now de&s;ire it, and the other gro&s;s Elements which could not contain him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> being Re&s;ident, chiefly at lea&s;t, in that invi&s;ible Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, the Air, and which we particularly call the World of Spirits, our bringing him out into Company is very unworthily call'd rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI>; for how can that be rais'd up, which is already not below?</P>
<P>However, if we will talk intelligibly, we mu&s;t call things as other People call them, and &s;peak of them as other People under&s;tand them, that they may know what we talk of, and know how to think upon what we &s;peak to them about. Having therefore no other way of expre&s;&s;ing it, you mu&s;t be content to hear me &s;peak of rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil,</HI> tho' at the &s;ame time I tell you 'tis Non&s;en&s;e in the very Terms, and contrary to Nature.</P>
<P>But to hold you no longer upon &s;ettling Preli|minaries, the Point in hand is, Can the Magicians who we are now &s;peaking of, rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> or can they not? Can the <HI>Magick Art</HI> perform this high Operation, is it in the reach of the Profe&s;&s;ion, and is <HI>Satan</HI> &s;ubjected to it? is he obliged to come
<PB N="382" REF="403">
when he is call'd, when &s;uch and &s;uch Words of Command are given out, &s;uch and &s;uch Methods us'd, &s;uch and &s;uch Words repeated? is he rous'd, as the Keeper rouzes the Lions in the <HI>Tower,</HI> di|&s;turb'd from his Abode, and oblig'd to come away? or as the Hunt&s;man unharbours a Deer, by his Horn and his Hallow?</P>
<P>If the <HI>Devil</HI> is under this Nece&s;&s;ity, and is thus at the Summons of every Gla&s;s Trumpet, as we may call it, that every Scoundrel ra&s;cally <HI>Figure ca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Circle-maker</HI> can fetch him up, when they think fit; I mu&s;t &s;ay, I think Satan is no free Agent; He is very far from being a Prince, and a Prince of the Power of the Air. Nay, there are &s;o many rational Objections again&s;t it, &s;o many Difficulties, Ab&s;urdities, and even Impo&s;&s;ibilities in it, that I think there is hardly room for any farther Di&s;pute about it; the thing has nothing in it rational, or agreeing to common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>But how is it done then? for that it is &s;o, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> does appear, when they call, does come, when he is &s;ent for, and that by the meane&s;t of tho&s;e Creatures who have tho&s;e Dealings with him, is not to be deny'd; nor never has been deni|able &s;ince the Witch of <HI>Endor</HI>'s Days, nor will it want Confirmation on many Occa&s;ions &s;ince that: Did not &s;he put it to <HI>Saul,</HI> who he would have her bring up? intimating that &s;he could bring up whom &s;he pleas'd, even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, if he wanted him.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be then by Concert and Agreement; for if the <HI>Devil</HI> can't be forc'd out of his Den, if he is not conjur'd up, as we call it; he mu&s;t be invited in a friendly manner, and prevail'd upon by En|treaties, or expected by Agreement; and in both the&s;e Ca&s;es 'tis much more ageeeable to our Under|&s;tanding, and we can conceive of things with much more Propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="404">Either he is invited by Entreaties and Petitions, importun'd and earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to come; and this is a kind of Peculiar; for that it is a Reality we have no room to doubt. I &s;ay, 'tis peculiar to tho&s;e Countries where the <HI>Devil</HI> is wor&s;hip'd as a God, where they bow the Knee, and, as the <HI>Indians</HI> call it, &s;ay <HI>O</HI> to him as a &s;upreme Power. That he willingly ob&s;erves the&s;e Summons, and comes when they de&s;ire him, is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e; as he is a poli|tick <HI>Devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and willing to pre&s;erve his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a|mong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m, willing to be wor&s;hip'd and ador'd, as he mo&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ly as upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, and which he in a manner triumphs over his Maker by, as if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d gain'd a Victory, had conquer'd tho&s;e Parts of his Dominions, and taken them from him by Force.</P>
<P>Or on the other hand, he is oblig'd by Contract, between h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elf and tho&s;e Infernal Merchants that trade with him. I &s;ay, he is oblig'd to come when they have Occa&s;ion for him; and in this ca&s;e he mu&s;t perform his Promi&s;e, or el&s;e he would not maintain his Credit, and would not be tru&s;ted again. Thus, in one, he is bound to come as he is a cun|ning <HI>Devil,</HI> and knows his Intere&s;t; and in the o|ther Ca&s;e, as he is an hone&s;t <HI>Devil,</HI> and keeps his Word; tho' the la&s;t is &s;ubject to many Breaches and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;ifications, and he is not always as good as his Word neither.</P>
<P>All the Difficulty that lies before us here, is, how he makes his Bargains. Witches and Wizards, they tell us, &s;ign Contracts, let him prick their Hands, and &s;ign with their Blood; Helli&s;h Doings! but I do not tell you I give any Credit to them. But the <HI>Magicians,</HI> who, it is &s;uppos'd, are Per&s;ons of a &s;u|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ur Dignity, &s;eem to act upon a better foot, and by the Help of what they call Art; have to do with him in a &s;uperior Way; what that Way is, and what Art it is to be call'd, that brings the
<PB N="384" REF="405">
Affairs of Hell into &s;uch a Management, is the great Que&s;tion before me.</P>
<P>It is true, the Magicians deny it, and Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI> would have told you he &s;corn'd your Words; he rai&s;ed no <HI>Devil,</HI> he had to do with no evil Spirits, he dealt with no &s;uch Cattle; but on the contrary, that he laid the <HI>Devil</HI> when other People rai&s;ed him; that he cured Hou&s;es that were haunted, and turned the <HI>Devil</HI> out of Doors when he was got in; all which I believe as &s;tedfa&s;tly as I do that St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> took him by the No&s;e with a pair of red hot Tongs; or that St. <HI>Francis</HI> would have nothing to do with him, when he appeared to him in the Shape of a Bag of Money; or that St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> re&s;i&s;ted him, when he tempted him in the Shape of a naked beautiful Lady.</P>
<P>Where, by the way, if the <HI>Legend Makers</HI> of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church could prove tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages to be true in Fact, &s;o that we could no more doubt them, we &s;hould have much more Rea&s;on to take tho&s;e two Per&s;ons for Saints than ever I thought we had. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, the thing would be rare in it&s;elf, to &s;ee a Prie&s;t kick a Pur&s;e of Gold out of his Way upon the Road, and not think it worth his while to take it up: So, to &s;ee a young Lady, beautiful and charming, offer her&s;elf to a Prie&s;t, and he turn from her, as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> from his Mi&s;tre&s;s, look'd a little more Saint-like than I mu&s;t own I &s;hould expect from any of the Tribe, e&s;pecially on the <HI>Roman</HI> Side of the Que&s;tion. I hope our own Church has abundance of &s;uch Saints among the Clergy, tho' I may not have the Honour to be acquainted with many of them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Men of Art can rai&s;e him; that &s;eems to be a Truth too &s;olid to be deny'd; and I mu&s;t not hazard my Reputation &s;o much as to oppo&s;e all the old Women that have &s;een him, or dream'd they &s;aw him: So that I mu&s;t take it for granted,
<PB N="385" REF="406">
that they can rai&s;e him; tho' I believe it no more than I do that Dr. <HI>Boreman</HI> could lay him when other People had rai&s;ed him, which I take to be whim&s;ical and ridiculous.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing then, for Di&s;cour&s;e &s;ake, that they can rai&s;e him, as they call it; What is it, and how is it done?</P>
<P>As to what it is, I take it to be no more than this; that the <HI>Devil</HI> is plea&s;ed, at their De&s;ire &s;igni|fy'd to him in &s;uch manner <HI>as to the Magician in his great Wi&s;dom &s;eems meet,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume a Vi&s;ibility, and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on &s;uch a Shape or Per&s;on as he and the Ma|gician agrees upon for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. This being granted, two Things nece&s;&s;arily follow:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the <HI>Devil</HI> and the Magician really cor|re&s;pond.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the <HI>Devil</HI> was pre&s;ent before, only not vi&s;ibly.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the <HI>Devil</HI> and the Magician corre|&s;pond: By Corre&s;ponding mu&s;t I think be under|&s;tood that the Magician knows where Satan is; that Mea&s;ures are concerted between them, how to conver&s;e; as was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e between him and <HI>Al|brahazen,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whom already; and that by the&s;e con|certed Mea&s;ures, he can ask the Favour of <HI>Satan</HI> as often as he plea&s;es, to make him&s;elf vi&s;ible for &s;uch or &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, as at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat time pre|&s;ents</P>
<P N="2">2. By this it &s;hould &s;eem, according to the Opinion of Some learned in this Wi&s;dom, that tho&s;e Magi|cians that are eminent in their Practice, have &s;ome <HI>Devil</HI> or other always with them, vi&s;ible to them|&s;elves, tho' invi&s;ible to others; and that they both &s;ee and conver&s;e with them continually. This is very rational to believe, and is what I take to be that which the Scripture means by having a Familiar Spirit; and that <HI>Mena&s;&s;eh</HI> had &s;uch, the Text is po|&s;itive
<PB N="386" REF="407">
in. Now that the&s;e Men or Women, whe|ther Magicians or what you plea&s;e to call them, can de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Favour of their <HI>Familiar</HI> or Seconda|ry <HI>Devil,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume a Shape and put on Vi&s;ibility, I make no que&s;tion of; it &s;eems to be no great matter, and to have no great Difficulty in it. On the other hand, the&s;e &s;eem to be the only People that can rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI>; for how &s;hould any body el&s;e do it upon &s;uch common and ordinary Occa|&s;ions, if he was not at their Elbow? how could they call him with muttering over a little Gib|beri&s;h, and talking it in Whi&s;per too? The <HI>Devil</HI> is not Omni&s;cient; he cannot, at the Di&s;tance of his airy Dwelling, know the Thoughts of the Agent, or &s;ee the Circles and Figures he draws; he mu&s;t therefore be invi&s;ibly pre&s;ent with him, can &s;ee his Circles, Cro&s;&s;es and Figures, and all his Motions, whe|ther publick or private; and I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that none can rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> in this manner but &s;uch Men as tho&s;e, that have a certain and con&s;tant In|tercour&s;e with him. I do not &s;ay that the Ma|gicians have this Corre&s;pondence with him, nor do I &s;ay or believe that all of them can bring <HI>Satan</HI> into Apparition when they plea&s;e; but this I do both &s;ay and believe, that tho&s;e that can or do thus rai&s;e him, <HI>as we call it,</HI> do it by this Means, and have &s;uch a Corre&s;pondence and Intimacy with him, and that it can be done by no other.</P>
<P>All the Notions which we can have of the <HI>Devil,</HI> founded upon the Scripture, or upon Rea&s;on, &s;eem to ju&s;tify this Opinion; for unle&s;s we &s;hall allow him to be Infinite, Omni&s;cient and Omnipre&s;ent, (and that would be to make him a God) we cannot make it rational that he &s;hould be commanded into Vi&s;i|bility and Action ju&s;t when we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If he is confin'd to Locality, if he is any-where, and that Any-where is Some-where, then he mu&s;t
<PB N="387" REF="408">
have &s;ome &s;ettled Intelligence e&s;tabli&s;hed between him and Mankind for the carrying on his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and this mu&s;t be carried on by the Agency of &s;ome Spirits, it cannot be by Voice only, by meer Whi|&s;per and Sugge&s;tion, if he be not pre&s;ent; for tho' it may be true that Spirits conver&s;e without the Help of Voice, yet infernal Spirits cannot act, as the Infinite Eternal Being acts, namely, by infinite ex|ten&s;ive Knowledge; they mu&s;t conver&s;e by the In|&s;trumentality and Agency of their Per&s;ons: it is true it may be imperceptible to human Sight, and it is &s;o; but there is not the le&s;s Reality in their Agency, for that there is not the le&s;s Per&s;onality nor Agency of Per&s;ons or Places on that account; for That may as really be that cannot be perceived to exi&s;t, as That which is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Now &s;tand clear Magick, and &s;tand clear Magi|cians; for if the Magician can rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> he mu&s;t corre&s;pond with the <HI>Devil</HI>; and if he corre|&s;ponds with the <HI>Devil,</HI> he mu&s;t have a Familiar; or how does he do it?

<P>If then they have any Spirits, I doubt they are <HI>Devils,</HI> not good Spirits; but my more ju&s;tifiable Opinion, and which I think is really well-grounded, is, that mo&s;t, if not all of them, who pretend to this Conver&s;e with Spirits, have no Knowledge of, or Corre&s;pon|dence with, any Spirits at all; but that all the Cant of their good Spirits, the Inhabitants o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the invi&s;ible World, and their Intelligence with them is a Cheat, a meer Cheat and Delu&s;ion, to abu&s;e the ignorant world, impo&s;e upon the weak, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ible gain them&s;elves a Character and a Fame o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, in order to pick Pockets and get Money.</P>

too, for that they are &s;o put together, that not only no body that hears them can under|&s;tand them, but that they do not under&s;tand 'em them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This certainly is the ju&s;t Character of mo&s;t of the Magicians we meet with in our Times; what may have been formerly, or what may yet be, where the <HI>Devil</HI> has really a Corre&s;pondence with any of the&s;e People, and if there are any <HI>Albrahazens</HI> alive, I will not determine; but then, I &s;ay, either the&s;e mu&s;t have a more than intimate Conver&s;e with the <HI>De|vil</HI> per&s;onally, as <HI>Ali</HI> had, or they mu&s;t do it by way of <HI>Familiar,</HI> by a con&s;tant attending Agent; and then they are no more Magicians, but <HI>Necroman|cers,</HI> and downright Dealers with the <HI>Devil</HI>; and this is not what we are talking of, it not what they pretend to, nor is it really in them.</P>
<P>To bring it then down to the Ca&s;e in hand, I mean about rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI>; the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion is of two Parts, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether the Magicians have a Power to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> that is, to produce an Appearance or Apparition of the <HI>Devil.</HI> This, I &s;ay, I will not deny; only that then I &s;ay, they are no more Magicians, but Witches, Wizards, Necromancers, or what el&s;e you plea&s;e to call tho&s;e People that have an immediate Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether, if they can do it at all, 'tis done <HI>as an Art,</HI> a Sy&s;tem, for the Practice of which there are Rules and Methods, which being learned by others, enables them to perform the &s;ame thing, as an Operation, whether mathematical or other|wi&s;e? and this I think I may venture to deny; becau&s;e I think it &s;ubjects Satan to &s;uch a Situation of Circum&s;tances, as are incon&s;i&s;tent with all the No|tions we have of him as a Spirit; as a powerful unlimited Seraph, a Prince of the Air, and who (except where his Maker has limited and pre&s;cribed
<PB N="390" REF="411">
him) is placed in a Station inconceivably &s;uperior to all human Influence or Operation.</P>
<P>To talk of &s;crewing the <HI>Devil</HI> up into an En|gine, that like a Jack in a Box he may be brought out and &s;hewn for a Sight to the People whenever a Conjurer thinks fit, or to be &s;hewn like a Puppet-Show for Two-pence a-piece, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, this is really di&s;honouring the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What may be done by Concert and Agreement between the <HI>Devil</HI> and them, is one thing; but to talk of bringing him out by an Art or Invention, &s;o that, as I &s;aid before, the Arti&s;ts may call him in, or call him up, when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, this wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be rai&s;ing him indeed, in the very litteral Sen&s;e of the Word; and may be, for ought I know, what was the true Meaning of the Expre&s;&s;ion at fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nd I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve here, this rai&s;ing the <HI>Devil</HI> is an old way of &s;peaking, and was formerly much more in u&s;e a|mong us than it is now; for I am not yet deter|mined in the matter fully, whether it be a Fact or a meer proverbial Speech: My Opinion at pre&s;ent mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be for the latter; for as to rai&s;ing him, 'tis, as I have &s;aid already, a piece of Non&s;en&s;e, becau&s;e (1) it intimates that he is fetch'd up <HI>ab in|feris,</HI> from Below; whereas I have given many good Rea&s;ons to move you to believe he is already rather Above than Below: and, (2) Becau&s;e I can give you many more to prove, that if he was Be|low, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Hell,</HI> in the bottomle&s;s Pit it &s;elf, as we have too much fancy'd he is; all the old Women and old Witches, and all the Prayers in the Pari&s;h, read backward, all the Circles and Figures, all the <HI>Paw-waws</HI> and Conjurings in the World, could never fetch him out again; 'till He comes, who has the Key of the <HI>Bottomle&s;s Pit,</HI> and <HI>who &s;huts,</HI> and no Man <HI>can open.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="412">We are told that St. <HI>Peter</HI> gave our holy Father of St. <HI>Angelo</HI> the Keys of <HI>Heaven</HI>; but I doubt he has not the Keys of t'other Place too; if he has, he has been but a &s;orry Jaylor, for the <HI>Devil</HI> has been abroad the&s;e four thou&s;and Years to our Knowledge, and continues &s;till at large; not a Con&s;table can take him up, even a <HI>Scape Warrant</HI> cannot apprehend him.</P>
<P>As he is then <HI>at large,</HI> tho' he is a Pri&s;oner too in one Sen&s;e, but as I &s;ay the <HI>Devil</HI> is at large, he is then a free Agent as to us, he goes <HI>to and fro, in</HI> or throughout <HI>the Earth,</HI> and <HI>walks up and down therein,</HI> Job. i.7.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Seeing, as the <HI>Magicians</HI> pretend, they do not Deal with the <HI>Devil,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> Who it is they do De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with, how is their Corre&s;pondence managed, and why do they Deal with Good Spirits, by Conju|rings and the Black Art?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE remain but two Que&s;tions then, which have any Difficulty in them, to &s;peak to in this Affair of Magick; the fir&s;t is the natural Con&s;equence of what is &s;aid before; If the <HI>Magi|cian</HI> cannot rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> who and what it is he does rai&s;e? for we will have it that he has Spirits about him: If they are not evil Spirits, as he will a&s;&s;ert in his own Defence, what Spirits are they, and by what Power or Influence does he maintain &s;uch a Corre&s;pondence among the Intelligent Beings of the invi&s;ible World, as to procure tho&s;e &s;uperior Angelick Creatures to appear upon Earth, either at his Reque&s;t, or upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions as he repre|&s;ents to them?</P>
<P>There is too much Difficulty, I had almo&s;t &s;aid Ab&s;urdity, in this Part, for us to come into it, as the <HI>Magicians</HI> pretend to de&s;ire; they would
<PB N="393" REF="414">
have us believe that all they do is by the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e happy Intelligent Beings, that they, upon the meer Principle of Affection to Mankind, and meerly from their Beneficent Na|ture and Di&s;po&s;ition, are ready at all times to a&s;|&s;i&s;t their faithful Agent or Servant the <HI>Magician,</HI> in doing acts of Charity, Kindne&s;s and Benevolence to their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Magician</HI> by this puts a great Compliment upon him&s;elf, and &s;ugge&s;ts that he is him&s;elf a general Ble&s;&s;ing to Mankind; and that as &s;uch the&s;e Generous and Beneficent BEINGS &s;in|gle out them (the <HI>Magicians</HI>) as the proper In&s;tru|ments of their Kindne&s;s to their Fellow-Creatures; and that they even could not act, at lea&s;t not &s;o fully and effectually, without them.</P>
<P>That therefore it is, tho&s;e &s;uperior Beings are pleas'd to conver&s;e with the&s;e <HI>Magicians,</HI> and com|municate to them a &s;uperior Knowledge of things, making them u&s;eful to Mankind, and giving them a Reputation for their Wi&s;dom, that &s;o the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed People may apply to them for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Direction and Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>But then the &s;econd Que&s;tion is, How do they conver&s;e with them, by what means do tho&s;e good Spirits come to know when the <HI>Magician</HI> has any thing to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in, and in what manner do they claim or de&s;ire their A&s;&s;i&s;tance? Now the Diffi|culty of this Que&s;tion rai&s;es a Doubt almo&s;t un|an&s;werable again&s;t the Truth of the <HI>Magician</HI>'s An|&s;wer to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>They tell us they conver&s;e with the good Spi|rits of the invi&s;ible World: That they would have us take as a fir&s;t Principle, a <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> that &s;hould be granted; tho' 'tis pretty much to ask too: but to oblige them as far as with any colour of com|mon Sen&s;e can be done, let us &s;uppo&s;e it, tho' I can by no means grant it.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415">But how then is it manag'd? How is this Con|ver&s;e carry'd on? In a word, how do they come together? It mu&s;t be either,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By the <HI>Magicians</HI> applying to the&s;e Spirits for Advice when they want it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Or by the Spirits officiou&s;ly coming to them upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, of their own meer Good|ne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Or tho&s;e good Spirits mu&s;t be always pre&s;ent, and to be &s;een, &s;poken to, and conver&s;ed with, with|out calling, or without &s;eeking to be call'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I mu&s;t be &s;o plain with our <HI>Magicians,</HI> as to &s;ay, that I do not &s;ee how either of the&s;e three can be made out by them; nor yet how they can defend them|&s;elves from the Charge of Diabolick Magick, un|le&s;s they make out all the three, and that very clearly too.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>Magicians</HI> applying to the&s;e Spirits for Advice and Intelligence; this I know is their Pre|tence, this they all alledge; and when the poor ignorant People apply to them, they make a great deal of Ceremony with their Circles and Figures, with Magical Books, <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Arabick</HI> Chara|cters, muttering of hard Words, and other Barba|ri&s;ms innumerable; Ju&s;t, in a word, as the old Necromancers do, when they con&s;ult with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Now, is there any thing of all this requi&s;ite in order to conver&s;e with a good Spirit? did the Prophets of old u&s;e any thing of this Mimickry, when they went to enquire of the Lord? If they would have their Art be call'd the Sacred Science, and we mu&s;t believe that they conver&s;e with Hea|venly Beings, what need of all the&s;e Amu&s;ements, the&s;e Conjurings and Paw-wawings?</P>
<P>Will they make us believe that the good Spi|rits are to be us'd as the Wizards and Witches u&s;e
<PB N="395" REF="416">
the <HI>Devil?</HI> that they are to be brought down by Mutterings and Conjurings, by Po&s;tures and Di&s;tor|tions, or (as our Dancing-Ma&s;ters talk) by Gro|te&s;que Characters? This would do very little to oblige our Reverence, Nor to me, would it look like any thing but talking to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>If it is done to put an Amu&s;ement upon the ignorant People that come to them, and to give a Soleminity (as they call it) to the thing, then 'tis evident it is done to cheat them. For what Oc|ca&s;ion could there be for &s;uch things, if they were really about to conver&s;e with the exalted Spirits of a heavenly Kind, and Inhabitants of the invi&s;ible Regions?</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t they apply to their invi&s;ible an|gelick Spirits, ju&s;t as the other &s;ort of People do to the <HI>Devil.</HI> Their Ceremonies of Ad|dre&s;s are much the &s;ame, and when the poor ig|norant Stranger &s;eems &s;urpriz'd at it, they tell him he &s;hould not fear, for they are not going to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI>; granting clearly that there was good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it.</P>
<P>If they are Hone&s;t, why then will they not tell us the rea&s;on of all the&s;e Barbari&s;ms? What Cau&s;e, and what Nece&s;&s;ity, when they are apply|ing to Heaven, to act ju&s;t as tho&s;e do who apply to Hell? Let them examine Hi&s;tory or An|tiquity, nay let them examine Nature; are the Application to God and Idols the &s;ame? The <HI>Devil</HI> may mimick the Methods of the be&s;t Ser|vice, and &s;eek to be &s;erved in the &s;ame manner as his Maker; but we no where read that ever the Servants of God mimick'd the <HI>Devil</HI>; 'till now.</P>
<P>Let them look at that eminent Time, when the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> brought him&s;elf and the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal</HI> to a Te&s;t for the Truth of their Wor|&s;hip,
<PB N="396" REF="417">
and the Reality of the GOD they wor|&s;hip'd: The Idolatrous Prie&s;ts began their Pagan Rites, their Sacrifices were alike; that was ap|pointed by the Prophet, becau&s;e they &s;hould not &s;ay but their Idol <HI>Devil</HI> had equal Honour done him, as the true God had, in a Proportion. But when they came to the Service of the Prie&s;ts, the Idol-Prie&s;ts us'd their Exorci&s;ms, their Conjurings, their Ec&s;ta&s;ies and their Barbari&s;ms, leaping up upon their Altars, and dancing to their God, then cutting them&s;elves with Knives, and the like.</P>
<P>But when the truly reverend Prophet came to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;acred Office, and the Apparatus of lay|ing the Sacrifice upon the Wood was &s;imply per|formed; what did <HI>Elijah?</HI> nothing, but in a &s;olemn manner, and in the Audience of all the People, and in the Vulgar Tongue, that they might all under&s;tand what was &s;aid, and with a loud Voice, call upon the True God to hear him, and to glorifie him&s;elf in the Sight of the People; and God did hear him, and magnified his Power ac|cordingly, to the Conviction of the People, even to the Conviction of their Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Bring this down to our Ca&s;e now. Here is a &s;et of Men pretending to con&s;ult the good Spi|rits, Inhabitants of the &s;uperior Regions, and who dwell in the angelick World, where-ever that is. To the&s;e they give all the adorable Names they can devi&s;e, in &s;trange and Outlandi&s;h Terms, and advance them in their Notions, that they may rai&s;e the Regard of their wondering, but ignorant Admirers.</P>
<P>When they have done all this, they apply to them ju&s;t after the Pattern of the Wizards and Necromancers in their enquiring of the <HI>Devil,</HI> with Mutterings and Whi&s;pers, with hard and
<PB N="397" REF="418">
exotick Words, and unintelligible Speeches; as if the good Spirits did not under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> well as <HI>Arabick</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> or as well as their unmeaning, un&s;ignifying <HI>Devil-Language</HI>; a Jargon of their own forming, without any real U&s;age among Men, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uch as they plea&s;e to put up|on it.</P>
<P>How can this be reconcil'd to the conver&s;ing with Good Spirits? Intelligent and Beneficent Beings, who partake of the Heavenly Nature, and are always inclined to do good to Mankind, who a&s;&s;i&s;t the Indigent and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and protect tho&s;e that are in Danger, direct in Difficulties, and are ready on all Occa&s;ions to do good Offices and Acts of Kindne&s;s to every one?</P>
<P>How are they thus ready and beneficent, if they are thus to be call'd out of their happy Abodes, like <HI>Devils,</HI> with Spells and Conjurations, with Necromancy and Wizardi&s;m? Were they &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed, bountiful, and beneficent Beings, and &s;o ready to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t Mankind in times of Dif|ficulties, protect them from Evil, and from evil Spirits, 'twould be but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould give &s;ome Directions to Mankind, how to obtain and procure their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when they want it.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed, if the&s;e Spirits are &s;uch good, &s;uch beneficent, compa&s;&s;ionate Beings, and &s;o par|ticularly inclined to do good to Mankind; I &s;ay, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed they are &s;o, by the determinate Appointment of their Creator; their Heavenly Fa|ther, from who&s;e inherent Goodne&s;s all good De&s;ires, and all good Thoughts do proceed, as well in Heaven as in Earth, as well in Angels and Spirits, as in humane Creatures. The&s;e good Spi|rits then, if they were &s;uch as is pretended, would certainly direct Mankind to obtain their Aid, by
<PB N="398" REF="419">
praying to the Supreme Being, under who&s;e Com|mand and Direction they immediately are, that they (the &s;aid good Spirits) might be &s;ent to di|rect, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and protect tho&s;e that &s;o de&s;ire their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is a &s;hrewd Sign to me, that the&s;e Spirits are of another Cla&s;s, and that they do not proceed from Him who is the Author of all Good; that they mu&s;t be apply'd to in &s;uch a &s;candalous manner, ju&s;t as the <HI>Devil</HI> is apply'd to; that they take the Honour to them&s;elves of being apply'd to di|rectly and immediately, as God him&s;elf is, and without giving the Honour to God, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e and Original Author of all Good; and that they at the &s;ame time &s;toop &s;o low, as to accept of the like mean and ba&s;e Methods of being call'd to for Help, which are u&s;ed when we want to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>What do the <HI>Magicians</HI> mean by this uncouth Jargon, <HI>I'll go and con&s;ult with the good Spirits which I conver&s;e with, and I'll bring you an An|&s;wer?</HI> Where are the&s;e good Spirits, and how do they conver&s;e with them? If they would &s;ay, I will pray to God that he may &s;end his Angels, or &s;ome of his Angels, or good Spirits, to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t you; this had &s;ome Sen&s;e in it; &s;ome|thing like the u&s;ual Method: then when we came to the <HI>Magician</HI> or Cunning Man, our Language would be, we pray you <HI>Enquire of the Lord for us</HI>; and thus it was when God had his good Prophets, and his good Spirits to act between his People and him, as much as can be &s;uppos'd now.</P>
<P>But now the <HI>Magician,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;aying I will enquire of the Lord for you, &s;ays I will con|&s;ult with the good Spirits of the invi&s;ible World, who I have the Honour to conver&s;e with, and I will tell you what they &s;ay in your Ca&s;e. Here's

<P N="2">2.

<P>This is a formal Story, and might have &s;ome Weight in it, if it were not that it wanted Truth of Fact to &s;upport it; and that this is &s;o, we mu&s;t believe, 'till we get the following Diffi|culties removed. The fir&s;t is, How do they know the Condition and Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e that want to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted? That the&s;e good Spirits mu&s;t either know it by an infinite Pre&s;cience,
<PB N="400" REF="421">
by which they mu&s;t every one of them know every thing, and that not every thing that is vi|&s;ible to human Eyes and Real, but every invi|&s;ible and imaginary Thing, the Thoughts, the Angui&s;h of the Soul, the De&s;ires, Wi&s;hes, Fears, Terrors, and Hopes of, not only the par|ticular Per&s;ons they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t, but of all Peo|ple whatever, in all Places and Times, and on every particular Occa&s;ion whatever; and to do &s;o would be to be ab&s;olutely and e&s;&s;entially God, and every one of them &s;eparately &s;o; a Thought attended with a Heap of horrid Confu&s;ions, and forming di&s;tracted Images in the Mind, &s;uch as tend to all manner of Bla&s;phemies on one hand, or gro&s;s Ab&s;urdities on the other.</P>
<P>The next thing is, if the good Spirits cannot by their own Pre&s;cience know the Condition and Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e that may want their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; how, or by whom mu&s;t they be, or are they informed of it?</P>
<P>Now here is the only <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> in which the Magi|cian makes him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary; for if the good Spirits had, joined to &s;o univer&s;al Beneficence in their Di&s;|po&s;ition, an infinite Knowledge of all the Per&s;ons and their Circum&s;tances who &s;tood in any need of their Help, they would then certainly, in con&s;e|quence of the general good Di&s;po&s;ition of their Na|ture, immediately apply them&s;elves to the proper Objects, and in Compa&s;&s;ion to them would relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t them of their own free Goodne&s;s and Be|neficence, not needing the Interpo&s;ition of any o|ther Agent what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But now this we do not find: but the&s;e good Spirits, with all the Good-will which they bear to us, yet &s;it pa&s;&s;ively &s;till, and &s;ee all the Mi&s;eries of Mankind, and all the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es which this or that particular Per&s;on labours under, and perhaps lan|gui&s;hes
<PB N="401" REF="422">
in, and at la&s;t lets him peri&s;h without the lea&s;t Help or A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This, I think, de&s;troys the very Notion of their Pre&s;cience, or el&s;e it mu&s;t de&s;troy the Notion of their Beneficence; one or other mu&s;t drop: they mu&s;t either not know of the mi&s;erable Wretch and his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, who wants their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; or knowing it, they mu&s;t want a Will or Power to a&s;&s;i&s;t and de|liver him.</P>
<P>But here comes in the Magician, and he truly, to make him&s;elf a nece&s;&s;ary Man in his Generation, is to be made acquainted with our Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and our Complaints, and he is to lay them before the&s;e good Spirits, and procure their An&s;wers; in which Ca&s;e it follows mo&s;t naturally,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That tho&s;e good Spirits are &s;hort-&s;ighted, ignorant and uninform'd Beings, 'till they receive Information from &s;ome inferior Hand: Thus in &s;hort, the Coun&s;ellor at Law; he is ready to give his Advice in the mo&s;t difficult Ca&s;e, and perfectly qua|lifyed and able to direct what you &s;hould do; but he &s;its in his Chambers in the <HI>Temple</HI> or in <HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> and waits (perfectly pa&s;&s;ive in all Bu&s;ine&s;s) 'till the Client, brought by the Attorney or Sollicitor, comes to him with his Brief; and if the Client does not come, he may &s;it &s;till and be ruined for any Advice or A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Lawyer will give him, 'till he is asked: Or as the Phy&s;ician; he is Ma&s;ter of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, able to direct and advi&s;e, able to pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cribe a Specifick, a certain Cure, for &s;uch or &s;uch Di&s;tempers; but &s;its in his Study, and &s;tirs not out of his ea&s;ie Chair, to do the di&s;tre&s;s'd People in his Neighbourhood any good, or to help them in their greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, 'till he is &s;ent for, and the Ca&s;e laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore him, and then he &s;hews his beneficent good Di&s;po&s;ition: If they have &s;taid 'till the Di&s;temper is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o far gone, he pities them and &s;hews his Con|cern
<PB N="402" REF="423">
for them; but adds, Why did not you let me know his Condition &s;ooner? I could ha' &s;av'd his Life if you had &s;ent to me in time; but how &s;hould I do him any good, when you did not &s;o much as let me know he was &s;ick? and thus the poor Patient langui&s;hes and dies, and the Phy&s;ician is not blam'd by any body, for how &s;hould he help him, when they did not &s;end to him for Advice, or &s;o much as let him know he was &s;ick?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Magicians are a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Generation of Men, that without them the mi&s;erable World would be robb'd of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all tho&s;e beneficent good Spirits in the invi&s;ible World, which wait to do us good, but cannot apply them|&s;elves to exert the good Di&s;po&s;itions they are filled with, for want of knowing the Condition and Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Creatures which &s;tand in need of their Help; and that tho&s;e Magi|ans being the only Men that conver&s;e in that invi|&s;ible World, and hold any Corre&s;pondence with the Spirits that are di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, they alone can hand that A&s;&s;i&s;tance to us, being the only Peo|ple that can acquaint the &s;aid good Spirits with our Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That therefore 'tis our only Bu&s;ine&s;s to cheri&s;h and encourage the&s;e u&s;eful Men called Magi|cians, and to take care that the Race be not extinct, and the World deprived of their extraordinary Per|formances.</P>
<P>This would be a noble Doctrine for the Men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Figures and Circles, a Magician would out-do al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Mountebanks, Quacks and Pretenders to infal+lible Remedies in the World; they would bring <HI>Law, Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Divinity</HI> into one Head of Pra+ctice, and, good Spirits in&s;piring, they would cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Age of all its Di&s;tempers both of Soul an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Body, they would re&s;olve all Ca&s;es of Con+&s;cience

<HI>Jure divino,</HI> cure all the Incurables in <HI>Guy</HI>'s Ho&s;pital, and make that old &mdash;'s Cha|rity as u&s;ele&s;s as his &mdash;s. They would abridge the Practice of the Law to Perfection, and bring all the Pleadings at Bar to Chamber Practice; the good Spirits would all be Peace-makers, and Ma|gicians be general Arbitrators.</P>
<P>But this not being at pre&s;ent our Ca&s;e, from hence I venture to conclude, that the&s;e good Spirits, if &s;uch there be, are not &s;o intimate with our modern Magicians as the latter pretend they are; and 'tis to be doubted the&s;e carry on their Intelligence with a different &s;ort of Spirits, and in a Manage &s;avouring a little more of the Diabolick than the Angelick; or, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> with no Spirits at all.</P>
