<DIV1 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>JULIUS CAESAR, FIRST EMPEROR.</HEAD>
<P>CAESAR has been much celebrated for his fortune, and yet his <MILESTONE N="706" UNIT="U. C."> abilities &s;eem equal to his highe&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. He enjoyed many &s;hining qua|lities, without the intermixture of any defect but that of ambition. His talents were &s;uch as would have rendered him victorious at the head of any army he commanded, and he would have go|verned in any republic that had given him birth. Having now gained a mo&s;t complete victory, his &s;ucce&s;s only &s;eemed to increa&s;e his activity, and
<PB N="2" REF="8">
in&s;pire him with fre&s;h re&s;olution to face new dangers. He re&s;olved, therefore, to pur&s;ue his la&s;t advantage, and follow Pompey to what|ever country he &s;hould retire; convinced that during his life he might gain new triumphs, but could never enjoy &s;ecurity. Hearing therefore of his being at Amphipolis, he &s;ent off his troops before him, and then embarked on board a little frigate in order to cro&s;s the Helle&s;pont; but, in the middle of the &s;treight, he fell in with one of Pompey's commanders, at the head of ten &s;hips of war. Cae&s;ar, no way terrified at the &s;uperiority of his force, bore up to him, and commanded him to &s;ub|mit. The other in&s;tantly obeyed, awed by the terror of Cae&s;ar's name, and &s;urrendered him&s;elf and his fleet at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>From thence he continued his voyage to Ephe&s;us, then to Rhodes; and, being informed that Pompey had been there before him, he made no doubt but that he was fled to Egypt; wherefore, lo&s;ing no time, he &s;et &s;ail for that kingdom&punc; and arrived at Alexandria with about four thou&s;and men; a very incon&s;iderable force to keep &s;uch a powerful kingdom under &s;ub|jection. But he was now grown &s;o &s;ecure in his good fortune, that he expected to find obedience wherever he found men. Upon his landing, the fir&s;t accounts he received were of Pompey's mi&s;erable end; and &s;oon after one
<PB N="3" REF="9">
of the murderers came with his head and ring as a mo&s;t grateful pre&s;ent to the conqueror. But Cae&s;ar had too much humanity to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch an horrid &s;pectacle; he turned away from it with horror, and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, gave vent to his pity in a flood of tears. He &s;hortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory, on the &s;pot where he was murdered; and a temple near the place to Ne|me&s;is, who was the godde&s;s that puni&s;hed tho&s;e that were cruel to men in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that the Egyptians by this time had &s;ome hopes of breaking off all alli|ance with the Romans; which they con&s;idered, as in fact it was, but a &s;pecious &s;ubjection. They fir&s;t began to take offence at Cae&s;ar's car|rying the en&s;igns of Roman power before him as he entered the city. Photinus the eunuch al&s;o treated him with great di&s;re&s;pect, and even attempted his life. Cae&s;ar, however, who knew how to di&s;&s;emble, concealed his re&s;ent|ment till he had a force &s;ufficient to puni&s;h his treachery, and &s;ending privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for Pom|pey's &s;ervice, as being the neare&s;t to Egypt, he, in the mean time, pretended to repo&s;e an en|tire confidence in the king's mini&s;ter, making great entertainments, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the con|ferences of the philo&s;ophers who were in great numbers at Alexandria. However, he &s;oon
<PB N="4" REF="10">
changed his manner when he found him&s;elf in no danger from the mini&s;ter's attempts, and declared, that, as being Roman con&s;ul, it was his duty to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Egyptian crown.</P>
<P>There were at that time two pretenders to the crown of Egypt; Ptolemy, the acknowledged king; and the celebrated Cleopatra, his &s;i&s;ter; who, by the cu&s;tom of the country, was al&s;o his wife, and, by their father's will, &s;hared jointly in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. However, not being contented with a bare participation of power, &s;he aimed at governing alone; but being oppo&s;ed in her views by the Roman &s;enate, who confirmed her brother's title to the crown, &s;he was bani&s;hed into Syria with Ar&s;inoe her younger &s;i&s;ter. Cae|&s;ar, however, gave her new hopes of a&s;piring to the kingdom, and &s;ent to both her and her brother to plead their cau&s;e before him. Pho|tinus, the young king's guardian, who had long borne the mo&s;t inveterate hatred, as well to Cae&s;ar as to Cleopatra, di&s;dained accepting this propo&s;al, and backed his refu&s;al by &s;ending an army of twenty thou&s;and men to be&s;iege him in Alexandria. Cae&s;ar bravely repul&s;ed the ene|my for &s;ome time, but finding the city of too great extent to be defended by &s;o &s;mall an army as he then commanded, he retired to the pa|lace, which commanded the harbour, where he purpo&s;ed to make his &s;tand. Achilles, who
<PB N="5" REF="11">
commanded the Egyptians, attacked him there with great vigour, and &s;till aimed at making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fleet that lay before the palace. Cae&s;ar, however, too well knew the im|portance of tho&s;e &s;hips in the hands of an ene|my; and therefore burnt them all, in &s;pite of every effort to prevent him. He next po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the i&s;le of Pharos, which was the key to the Alexandrian port; by which he was en|abled to receive the &s;upplies &s;ent him from all &s;ides; and, in this &s;ituation, he determined to with&s;tand the united force of all the Egyptians.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cleopatra, having heard of the pre&s;ent turn in her favour, re&s;olved to de|pend rather on Cae&s;ar's favour for gaining the government than her own forces. She had, in fact, a&s;&s;embled an army in Syria to &s;upport her claims; but now judged it the wi&s;e&s;t way to rely intirely on the deci&s;ion of her &s;elf-elected judge. But no arts, as &s;he ju&s;tly conceived, were &s;o likely to influence Cae&s;ar as the charms of her per&s;on, which, tho' not faultle&s;s, were yet extremely &s;educing. She was now in the bloom of youth, and every feature bor|rowed grace from the lively turn of her tem|per. To the mo&s;t enchanting addre&s;s &s;he joined the mo&s;t harmonious voice, which the hi&s;torians of her time compare to the be&s;t tuned in&s;trument; with all the&s;e accompli&s;hments &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of the learning of
<PB N="6" REF="12">
the times, and could give audience to the am|ba&s;&s;adors of &s;even different nations without an interpreter. The difficulty was how to get at Cae&s;ar, as her enemies were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues that led to the palace. For this purpo&s;e &s;he went on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and, in the evening, landed near the palace, where, being wrapt up in a coverlet, &s;he was carried by one A&s;polodorus into the very chamber of Cae&s;ar. Her addre&s;s, at fir&s;t, plea&s;ed him; her wit and under&s;tanding &s;till fanned the flame; but her care&s;&s;es, which were carried beyond the bounds of innocence, intirely brought him over to &s;econd her claims.</P>
<P>While Cleopatra was thus employed in for|warding her own views, her &s;i&s;ter Ar&s;inoe was al&s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly engaged in the camp, in pur|&s;uing a &s;eparate intere&s;t. She had found means, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Ganymede, her confi|dent, to make a large divi&s;ion in the Egyptian army in her favour; and &s;oon after, by one of tho&s;e &s;udden revolutions which are common in barbarian camps to this day, &s;he cau&s;ed Achil|las to be murdered, and Ganymede to take the command in his &s;tead, and to carry on the &s;iege with greater vigour than before. Ganymede's principal effort was by letting in the &s;ea upon tho&s;e canals which &s;upplied the palace with fre&s;h water; but this inconvenience Cae&s;ar remedied by digging a great number of wells. His next
<PB N="7" REF="13">
endeavour was, to prevent the junction of Cae|&s;ar's twenty-fourth legion, which he twice at|tempted in vain. He &s;oon after made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a bridge which joined the i&s;le of Pha|ros to the continent, from which po&s;t Cae&s;ar was re&s;olved to di&s;lodge him. In the heat of the action, &s;ome mariners, partly through curio|&s;ity, and partly ambition, came and joined the combatants, but, being &s;eized with a panic, in|&s;tantly fled, and &s;pread a general terror thro' the army. All Cae&s;ar's endeavours to rally his forces were in vain, the confu&s;ion was pa&s;t re|medy, and numbers were drowned or put to the &s;word in attempting to e&s;cape. Now, therefore, &s;eeing the irremediable di&s;order of his troops, he retired to a &s;hip, in order to get to the palace that was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite: however, he was no &s;ooner on board than great crowds entered at the &s;ame time with him; upon which, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;hip's &s;inking, he jumped into the &s;ea, and &s;wam two hundred paces to the fleet that lay before the palace, all the time holding his own Commentaries in his left hand above water, and his coat of mail in his teeth.</P>
<P>The Alexandrians, finding their efforts to take the palace ineffectual, endeavoured, at lea&s;t, to get their king out of Cae&s;ar's power, as he had &s;eized upon his per&s;on in the begin|ning of their di&s;putes. For this purpo&s;e they
<PB N="8" REF="14">
made u&s;e of their cu&s;tomary arts of di&s;&s;imula|tion, profe&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t de&s;ire for peace, and only wanting the pre&s;ence of their lawful prince to give a &s;anction to the treaty. Cae&s;ar, who was &s;en&s;ible of their perfidy, neverthele&s;s concealed his &s;u&s;picions, and gave them their king, as he was under no apprehen&s;ions from the abilities of a boy. Ptolemy, however, the in&s;tant he was &s;et at liberty, in&s;tead of promot|ing peace, made every effort to give vigour to ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>In this manner Cae&s;ar was hemmed in for &s;ome time by this artful and in&s;idious enemy, with all manner of difficulties again&s;t him; but he was at la&s;t relieved from this mortifying &s;ituation by Mithridates Pergamenus, one of his mo&s;t faithful partizans, who came with an army to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This general, collect|ing a numerous army in Syria, marched into Egypt, took the city of Pelu&s;ium, repul&s;ed the Egyptian army with lo&s;s, and at la&s;t, joining with Cae&s;ar, attacked their camp with a great &s;laughter of the Egyptians: Ptolemy him&s;elf, attempting to e&s;cape on board a ve&s;&s;el that was &s;ailing down the river, was drowned by the &s;hip's &s;inking, and Cae&s;ar thus became ma&s;ter of all Egypt without any farther oppo&s;ition. He therefore appointed, that Cleopatra, with her younger brother, who was then but an infant, &s;hould jointly govern, according to the intent
<PB N="9" REF="15">
of their father's will, and drove out Ar&s;inoe with Ganymede into bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>Having thus given away kingdoms, he now, for a while, &s;eemed to relax from the u&s;ual ac|tivity of his conduct, captivated with the charms of Cleopatra. In&s;tead of quitting Egypt to go and quell the remains of Pompey's party, he abandoned him&s;elf to his plea&s;ures, pa&s;&s;ing whole nights in fea&s;ts, and all the exce&s;&s;es of high wrought luxury with the young queen. He even re&s;olved to attend her up the Nile into Aethiopia; but the brave veterans who had long followed his fortune, boldly reprehended his conduct, and refu&s;ed to be partners in &s;o in|famous an expedition. Thus, at length, rouzed from his lethargy, he re&s;olved to prefer the call of ambition to that of love, and to leave Cleopatra, by whom he had a &s;on who was af|terwards named Cae&s;ario, in order to oppo&s;e Pharnaces the king of Bo&s;phorus, who had now made &s;ome inroads upon the dominions of Rome.</P>
<P>This prince, who was the &s;on of the great Mithridates, being ambitious of recovering his father's dominions, &s;eized upon Armenia and Colchis, and overcame Domitius, who had been &s;ent again&s;t him. Upon Cae&s;ar's march to op|po&s;e him, Pharnaces, who was as much terri|fied at the name of the general as at the &s;trength of his army, laboured, by all the arts of nego|tiation,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
to avert the impending danger. Cae&s;ar, exa&s;perated at his crimes and his ingratitude, at fir&s;t di&s;&s;embled with the amba&s;&s;adors, and, u&s;ing all expedition, fell upon the enemy un|expectedly, and, in a few hours, obtained a &s;peedy and a complete victory. Pharnaces at|tempting to take refuge in his capital, was &s;lain by one of his own commanders&mdash;A ju&s;t puni&s;hment for his former parricide. This vic|tory was gained with &s;o much ea&s;e, that Cae&s;ar could not avoid ob&s;erving, that Pompey was very happy in gaining &s;o much glory again&s;t this enemy at &s;o ea&s;y a rate. In writing to a friend at Rome, he expre&s;t the rapidity of his victory in three words, <HI>veni, vidi, vici:</HI> a man &s;o accu&s;tomed to conque&s;t thought a &s;light battle &s;carce worth a longer letter.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar having &s;ettled affairs in this part of the empire, as well as time would permit; hav|ing be&s;towed the government of Armenia upon Ariobarzanes, that of Judea upon Hyrcanus and Antipater, and that of Bo&s;phorus upon Mi|thridates, embarked for Italy, where he ar|rived &s;ooner than his enemies could expect, but not before his affairs there ab&s;olutely required his pre&s;ence. He had been, during his ab|&s;ence, created con&s;ul for five years, dictator for one year, and tribune of the people for life. But Anthony, who in the mean time governed in Rome for him, had filled the city with riot and
<PB N="11" REF="17">
debauchery, and many commotions en&s;ued, which nothing but the arrival of Cae&s;ar &s;o op|portunely could appea&s;e. However, by his mo|deration and humanity, he &s;oon re&s;tored tran|quility to the city, &s;carce making any di&s;tinction between tho&s;e of his own and the oppo&s;ite party. Thus having by gentle means re&s;tored his authority at home, he prepared to march into Africa, where Pompey's party had found time to rally under Scipio and Cato, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Juba, king of Mauritania. But the vigour of his proceedings had like to have been retarded by a mutiny in his own army. Tho&s;e veteran legions who had hitherto conquered all that came before them, began to murmur for not having received the rewards which they had expected for their pa&s;t &s;ervices, and now in|&s;i&s;ted upon their di&s;charge. The &s;edition fir&s;t broke out in the tenth legion, which till then had &s;ignalized them&s;elves for their valour and attachment to their general. Cae&s;ar, at fir&s;t, &s;trove to appea&s;e them by promi&s;es of future rewards; but the&s;e, in&s;tead of appea&s;ing the &s;edition, only &s;erved to increa&s;e it. The whole army marched forward from Campania towards Rome, pillaging and plundering all the way. Cae&s;ar immediately cau&s;ed the gates of the city to be &s;hut, and ordered &s;uch troops as were in rea|dine&s;s to defend the walls: he then boldly went out alone to meet the mutineers, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="12" REF="18">
the repre&s;entations of his friends who were concerned for his &s;afety. Upon coming into the Campus Martius, where the mo&s;t tumul|tuous were a&s;&s;embled, he boldly mounted his tribunal, and with a &s;tern air demanded of the &s;oldiers what they wanted, or who had con|ducted them there? A conduct &s;o re&s;olute &s;eemed to di&s;concert the whole band: they be|gan by complaining, that being worn out with fatigue, and exhau&s;ted by their numberle&s;s wounds, they were in hopes to obtain a di&s;|charge. "Then take your di&s;charge," cried Cae&s;ar, "and when I &s;hall have gained new "conque&s;ts with other troops, I promi&s;e that "you &s;hall be partakers in the &s;poil." So much genero&s;ity quite confounded the &s;editious, who were agitated between the contending pa&s;|&s;ions of gratitude and jealou&s;y; they were grateful for his intended bounty, and jealous le&s;t any other army &s;hould &s;hare the honours of completing the conque&s;t of the world. They unanimou&s;ly entreated his pardon, and even offered to be decimated to obtain it. Cae&s;ar for a while &s;eemed to continue inflexible, and at la&s;t granted as a favour what it was his intere&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, but the tenth le|gion continued ever after under his &s;evere di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, according to his u&s;ual diligence, land|ed with a &s;mall party in Africa, but the re&s;t of
<PB N="13" REF="19">
his army followed &s;oon after: After many movements, and &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes between both armies, which only &s;erved to de&s;troy man|kind without determining the cau&s;e of quar|rel, he re&s;olved at la&s;t to come to a deci&s;ive battle. For this purpo&s;e he inve&s;ted the city of Tap&s;us, &s;uppo&s;ing that Scipio would attempt its relief, which turned out according to his ex|pectations. Scipio, joining with the young king of Mauritania, advanced his army, and en|camping near Cae&s;ar they &s;oon came to a ge|neral battle. Cae&s;ar's &s;ucce&s;s was as u&s;ual, the enemy received a complete and final overthrow with little or no lo&s;s on his &s;ide. Juba and Petreius his general killed each other in de|&s;pair; Scipio, attempting to e&s;cape by &s;ea into Spain, fell in among the enemy and was &s;lain; &s;o that, of all the generals of that undone party, Cato was now alone remaining.</P>
<P>This extraordinary man, whom no pro&s;pe|rity could elate, nor any misfortunes depre&s;s, having retired into Africa after the battle of Phar&s;alia, had led the wretched remains of that defeat through burning de&s;arts and tracts in|fe&s;ted with &s;erpents of various malignity, and was now in the city of Utica, which he had been left to defend. Still, however, in love with even the &s;hew of Roman government, he had formed the principal citizens into a &s;enate, and conceived a re&s;olution of holding out the town. He accordingly a&s;&s;embled his &s;enators upon

this occa&s;ion, and demanded their advice upon what mea&s;ures were be&s;t to be taken, and whether they &s;hould defend this la&s;t city that owned the cau&s;e of freedom. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If," &s;aid he, "you are willing to &s;ubmit to Cae&s;ar, I mu&s;t acquie&s;ce; but if you are willing to hazard the dangers of defending the la&s;t remains of liberty, let me be your guide and com|panion in &s;o great an enterprize. Rome has often recovered from greater calamities than the&s;e, and there are many motives to en|courage our attempt. Spain has declared in our cau&s;e, and Rome it&s;elf bears the yoke with indignation. With re&s;pect to the ha|zards we mu&s;t encounter, why &s;hould they terrify us? Ob&s;erve our enemy: he braves every danger, and encounters every fatigue to undo mankind and make his country wretched; and &s;hall we &s;cruple to &s;uffer a &s;hort interval of pain in a cau&s;e &s;o glori|ous?"</Q> This &s;peech had at fir&s;t a &s;urpri&s;ing effect; but the enthu&s;ia&s;m for liberty &s;oon &s;ub|&s;iding, he was re&s;olved no longer to force men to be free who &s;eemed naturally prone to &s;la|very. He now therefore de&s;ired &s;ome of his friends to &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;ea, and bade others to rely upon Cae&s;ar's clemency; ob&s;erv|ing, that, as to him&s;elf, he was at la&s;t victo|rious. After this, &s;upping chearfully among his friends, he retired to his apartment, where he behaved with unu&s;ual tenderne&s;s to his &s;on,
<PB N="15" REF="21">
and to all his friends. When he came into his bed-chamber, he laid him&s;elf down, and took up Plato's dialogue on the immortality of the &s;oul; and, having read for &s;ome time, happen|ing to ca&s;t his eyes to the head of his bed, he was much &s;urprized not to find his &s;word there, which had been taken away by his &s;on's order while they were at &s;upper. Upon this, calling one of his dome&s;tics to know what was become of his &s;word, and receiving no an&s;wer, he re|&s;umed his &s;tudies; but &s;ome time after called for his &s;word again. When he had done reading, and perceiving nobody obeyed him in bring|ing his &s;word, he called all his dome&s;tics one after the other, and with a peremptory air de|manded his &s;word once more. His &s;on came in &s;oon after, and with tears be&s;ought him in the mo&s;t humble manner to change his re&s;o|lution, but, receiving a &s;tern reprimand, he de|&s;i&s;ted from his per&s;ua&s;ions. His &s;word being at length brought him he &s;eemed &s;atisfied, and cried out, "Now again I am ma&s;ter of my&s;elf." He then took up the book again, which he read twice over, and fell into a &s;ound &s;leep. Upon awaking, he called to one of his freedmen to know if his friends were embarked, or if any thing yet remained that could be done to &s;erve them. The freedman a&s;&s;uring him that all was quiet, was then ordered again to leave the room. He was no &s;ooner alone than he &s;tabbed
<PB N="16" REF="22">
him&s;elf with his &s;word through the brea&s;t, but not with that force he intended, for the wound not di&s;patching him, he fell upon his bed, and at the &s;ame time overturned a table on which he had been drawing &s;ome geometrical figures. At the noi&s;e he made in his fall his &s;ervants gave a &s;hriek, and his &s;on and friends imme|diately entered the room. They found him weltring in his blood, and his bowels pu&s;hed out through the wound. The phy&s;ician who attended his family perceiving that his inte&s;tines were yet untouched, was for replacing them; but when Cato had recovered his &s;en&s;es, and under&s;tood their intention to pre&s;erve his life, he pu&s;hed the phy&s;ician from him, and with a fierce re&s;olution tore out his bowels and expired.</P>
<P>In this manner Cato died, who was one of the mo&s;t faultle&s;s characters we find in the Roman hi&s;tory. He was &s;evere but not cruel, he was ready to pardon much greater faults in others than he could forgive in him&s;elf. His haughtine&s;s and au&s;terity &s;eemed rather the ef|fect of principle than natural con&s;titution, for no man was more humane to his dependents, or better loved by tho&s;e about him. The con|&s;tancy of his oppo&s;ition to Cae&s;ar proceeded from a thorough conviction of the inju&s;tice of his aims. And the la&s;t act of his life was but conformable to the tenets of his &s;ect; as the Stoics maintained, that life was a gift which all
<PB N="17" REF="23">
men might return to the donor when the pre|&s;ent was no longer plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, upon hearing of Cato's end, could not help ob&s;erving, that as Cato had envied him the glory of &s;aving his life, &s;o he had rea|&s;on to envy him the glory of &s;o bravely dying. Upon his death, the war in Africa being com|pleted, Cae&s;ar returned in triumph to Rome; and, as if he had abridged all his former tri|umphs only to encrea&s;e the &s;plendor of this, the citizens were a&s;toni&s;hed at the magnificence of the proce&s;&s;ion, and the number of the coun|tries he had &s;ubdued. It la&s;ted four days: the fir&s;t was for Gaul, the &s;econd for Egypt, the third for his victories in A&s;ia, and the fourth for that over Juba in Africa. His ve|teran &s;oldiers, all &s;carred with wounds, and now laid up for life, followed their triumphant ge|neral crowned with laurels, and conducted him to the Capitol. To every one of the&s;e he gave a &s;um equivalent to about an hundred and fifty pounds of our money, double that &s;um to the centurions, and four times as much to the &s;uperior officers. The citizens al&s;o &s;hared his bounty; to every one of which he di&s;tri|buted ten bu&s;hels of corn, ten pounds of oil, and a &s;um of money equal to about two pounds &s;terling of ours. He, after this, entertained the people at above twenty thou&s;and tables, treated them with the combat of gladiators,
<PB N="18" REF="24">
and filled Rome with a concour&s;e of &s;pectators from every part of Italy.</P>
<P>The people, intoxicated with the allurements of plea&s;ure, thought their freedom too &s;mall a return for &s;uch benefits. They &s;eemed eager only to find out new modes of homage, and unu&s;ual epithets of adulation for their great en&s;laver. He was created by a new title <HI>Ma|gi&s;ter Morum,</HI> or ma&s;ter of the morals of the people; he received the title of emperor, fa|ther of his country; his per&s;on was declared &s;acred; and, in &s;hort, upon him alone were de|volved for life all the great dignities of the &s;tate. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that &s;o much power could never have been intru&s;ted to better keeping. He immediately began his empire by repre&s;&s;ing vice and encouraging virtue. He committed the power of judicature to the &s;e|nators and the knights alone, and by many &s;umptuary laws re&s;trained the &s;candalous luxu|ries of the rich. He propo&s;ed rewards to all &s;uch as had many children, and took the mo&s;t prudent methods of repeopling the city that had been exhau&s;ted in the late commotions.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;tored pro&s;perity once more to Rome, he again found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of going into Spain to oppo&s;e an army which had been rai&s;ed there under the two &s;ons of Pompey, and Labienus his former general. He proceeded in this expedition with his u&s;ual
<PB N="19" REF="25">
celerity, and arrived in Spain before the enemy thought him yet departed from Rome. Cneius and Sextus, Pompey's &s;ons, profiting by their unhappy father's example, re&s;olved as much as po&s;&s;ible to protract the war; &s;o that the fir&s;t operations of the two armies were &s;pent in &s;ieges and fruitle&s;s attempts to &s;urprize each other. At length Cae&s;ar, after taking many cities from the enemy, and pur&s;uing Pompey with un|wearied per&s;everance, at la&s;t compelled him to come to a battle upon the plains of Munda. Pompey drew up his men by break of day upon the declivity of an hill with great exactne&s;s and order. Cae&s;ar drew up his men likewi&s;e in the plain below; and, after advancing a little way from his trenches, he ordered his men to make an halt, expecting the enemy to come down from the hill. This delay made Cae&s;ar's &s;ol|diers begin to murmur, while Pompey's with full vigour poured down upon them, and a dreadful conflict began. Hitherto Cae&s;ar had fought for glory, but here he fought for life. His &s;oldiers behaved with intrepidity in|cited by the hopes of making this a final pe|riod to their labour. Pompey's men were not le&s;s &s;trenuous, expecting no pardon, as having their lives formerly given them when over|thrown in Africa. The fir&s;t &s;hock was &s;o dread|ful, that Cae&s;ar's men, who had hitherto been u&s;ed to conquer, now began to waver. Cae&s;ar
<PB N="20" REF="26">
was never in &s;o much danger as now; he threw him&s;elf &s;everal times into the very throng of battle. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What," cried he, "are you going to give up your general, who is grown grey in fighting at your head, to a parcel of boys?"</Q> Upon this his tenth legion, willing to recover their general's lo&s;t e&s;teem, exerted them&s;elves with more than former bravery; and a party of hor&s;e being detached by Labienus from the camp in pur&s;uit of a body of Numidian cavalry, Cae&s;ar cried aloud, that they were flying. This cry in&s;tantly &s;pread it&s;elf through both armies, exciting the one as much as it depre&s;&s;ed the other. Now therefore the tenth legion pre&s;t forward, and a total rout &s;oon en&s;ued. Thirty thou&s;and men were killed on Pompey's &s;ide, among&s;t whom was Labienus, whom Cae&s;ar or|dered to be buried with the funeral honours of a general officer. Cneius Pompey e&s;caped with a few hor&s;emen to the &s;ea &s;ide, but finding his pa&s;&s;age intercepted by Cae&s;ar's lieutenant, he was obliged to &s;eek for a retreat in an ob&s;cure cavern. Here, wounded and de&s;titute of all kinds of &s;uccour, he patiently awaited the ap|proach of the enemy. He was quickly di&s;|covered by &s;ome of the enemy's troops, who pre&s;ently cut off his head and brought it to Cae&s;ar. His brother Sextus, however, concealed him&s;elf &s;o well that he e&s;caped all pur&s;uit; &s;o that Cae&s;ar was obliged to return without him,
<PB N="21" REF="27">
after having &s;everely fined the cities of Spain for their late imputed rebellion.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar by this la&s;t blow &s;ubdued all his avowed enemies, and had now conquered the be&s;t part of the world in almo&s;t as &s;hort a time as others would travel through the &s;ame extent of country. He therefore returned to Rome for the la&s;t time to receive new dignities and honours, and to enjoy in his own per&s;on an ac|cumulation of all the great offices of the &s;tate. Still however he pretended to a moderation in the enjoyment of his power; he left the con&s;uls to be named by the people; but, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the authority of the office, it from this time began to &s;ink into contempt. He enlarged the number of &s;enators al&s;o; but, as he had pre|viou&s;ly de&s;troyed their power, their new ho|nours were but empty titles. He took care to pardon all who had been in arms again&s;t him, but not till he had deprived them of the power of re&s;i&s;tance. He even &s;et up once more the &s;tatues of Pompey, which, however, as Cicero ob&s;erved, he only did to &s;ecure his own. In &s;hort, if his clemency, his ju&s;tice, and mode|ration did not proceed from virtue, yet they had all the effect of virtues in the &s;tate, which an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the public as well.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this extraordinary man's life was employed for the advantage of the &s;tate. He
<PB N="22" REF="28">
adorned the city with magnificent buildings; he rebuilt Carthage and Corinth, &s;ending co|lonies to both cities; he undertook to level &s;everal mountains in Italy, to drain the Pontine mar&s;hes near Rome, and de&s;igned to cut through the i&s;thmus of Pelopone&s;us. Thus, with a mind that could never remain inactive, he pondered mighty projects and de&s;igns be|yond the limits of the longe&s;t life; but the greate&s;t of all was his intended expedition again&s;t the Parthians, by which he de&s;igned to revenge the death of Cra&s;&s;us; then to pa&s;s through Hyrcania, and enter Scythia along the banks of the Ca&s;pian Sea; from thence to open him&s;elf a way through the immea&s;urable fore&s;ts of Germany into Gaul, and &s;o return to Rome. The&s;e were the aims of ambition: the jealou&s;y of a few individuals put an end to them all.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, with an adulation which marked the degeneracy of the times, continued to load him with fre&s;h honours, and he continued with equal vanity to receive them. They called one of the months of the year after his name; they &s;tampt money with his image; they or|dered his &s;tatue to be &s;et up in all the cities of the empire; they in&s;tituted public &s;acrifices on his birth-day; and talked, even in his life-time, of enrolling him among the number of their gods. Anthony, at one of the public fe&s;tivals, fooli&s;hly ventured to offer him a diadem; but
<PB N="23" REF="29">
he put it back again, refu&s;ing it &s;everal times, and receiving at every refu&s;al loud acclama|tions from the people. One day, when the &s;e|nate ordered him &s;ome particular honours, he neglected to ri&s;e from his &s;eat; and from that moment envy began to mark him for de&s;truc|tion. Mankind are ever mo&s;t offended at any tre&s;pa&s;s on ceremony, &s;ince a violation of de|corum is u&s;ually an in&s;tance of contempt. It began therefore to be rumoured that he in|tended to make him&s;elf king, which, though in fact he was, the people, who had an utter aver&s;ion to the name, could not bear his a&s;&s;um|ing the title. Whether he really de&s;igned to a&s;&s;ume that empty honour mu&s;t now for ever remain a &s;ecret; but certain it is, that the un|&s;u&s;pecting openne&s;s of his conduct marked &s;omething like a confidence in the innocence of his intentions. When informed by tho&s;e about him of the jealou&s;ies of many per&s;ons who envied his power, he was heard to &s;ay, That he had rather die once by trea&s;on, than to live con|tinually in apprehen&s;ions of it: when advi&s;ed by &s;ome to beware of Brutus, in whom he had for &s;ome time repo&s;ed the greate&s;t confidence, he opened his brea&s;t, all &s;carred with wounds, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Can you think Brutus cares for &s;uch poor pillage as this!"</Q> and being one night at &s;upper, as his friends di&s;puted among them|&s;elves what death was ea&s;ie&s;t, he replied, That
<PB N="24" REF="30">
which was mo&s;t &s;udden, and lea&s;t fore&s;een. But to convince the world how little he had to ap|prehend from his enemies, he di&s;banded his company of Spani&s;h guards, which facilitated the enterprize again&s;t his life; for he &s;hould have con&s;idered that confidence in an u&s;urper is but ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>A deep-laid con&s;piracy was ab&s;olutely in agi|tation again&s;t him, compo&s;ed of no le&s;s than &s;ixty &s;enators. They were &s;till the more for|midable as the generality of them were of his own party; and, being rai&s;ed above other citi|zens, felt more &s;trongly the weight of a &s;ingle &s;uperior. At the head of this con&s;piracy were Brutus, who&s;e life Cae&s;ar had &s;pared after the battle of Phar&s;alia; and Ca&s;&s;ius, who was par|doned &s;oon after; both praetors for the pre&s;ent year. Brutus made it his chief glory to have been de&s;cended from that Brutus who fir&s;t gave liberty to Rome. The pa&s;&s;ion for free|dom &s;eemed to have been tran&s;mitted with the blood of his ance&s;tors down to him. But though he dete&s;ted tyranny, yet he could not forbear loving the tyrant from whom he had received the mo&s;t &s;ignal benefits. However, the love of his country broke all the ties of private friend&s;hip, and he entered into a con|&s;piracy which was to de&s;troy his benefactor. Ca&s;&s;ius, on the other hand, was impetuous and proud, and hated Cae&s;ar's per&s;on &s;till more
<PB N="25" REF="31">
than his cau&s;e. He had often &s;ought an op|portunity of gratifying his revenge by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation, which took ri&s;e rather from private than from public motives.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators, to give a colour of ju&s;tice to their proceedings, remitted the execution of this de&s;ign to the ides of March, the day on which Cae&s;ar was to be offered the crown. The augurs had foretold that this day would be fatal to him, and the night preceding he heard his wife Calpurnia lamenting in her &s;leep, and being awakened &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to him, that &s;he dreamt of his being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in her arms. The&s;e omens in &s;ome mea&s;ure began to change his intentions of going to the &s;enate, as he had re&s;olved, that day; but one of the con&s;pirators coming in, prevailed upon him to keep his re&s;o|lution, telling him of the reproach which would attend his &s;taying at home till his wife had lucky dreams, and of the preparations that were made for his appearance. As he went along to the &s;enate, a &s;lave, who ha&s;tened to him with in|formation of the con&s;piracy, attempted to come near him, but could not for the crowd. Arte|midorus, a Greek philo&s;opher, who had di&s;covered the whole plot, delivered him a memorial con|taining the heads of his information; but Cae&s;ar gave it, with other papers, to one of his &s;ecreta|ries without reading, as was u&s;ual in things of this nature. Being at length entered the Senate|hou&s;e,
<PB N="26" REF="32">
where the con&s;pirators were prepared to receive him, he met one Spurina, an augur, who had foretold his danger, to whom he &s;aid, &s;miling,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, Spurina, the ides of March are come." "Yes," replied the augur, "but they are not yet over."</Q> As &s;oon as he had taken his place, the con&s;pirators came near him under pretence of &s;aluting him; and Cimber, who was one of them, approached in a &s;uppliant po&s;ture, pretending to &s;ue for his brother's par|don, who was bani&s;hed by his order. All the con&s;pirators &s;econded him with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s; and Cimber, &s;eeming to &s;ue with &s;till greater &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, took hold of the bottom of his robe, holding him &s;o as to prevent his ri|&s;ing. This was the &s;ignal agreed on. Ca&s;ca, who was behind, &s;tabbed him, though &s;lightly, in the &s;houlder. Cae&s;ar in&s;tantly turned round, and, with the &s;tyle of his tablet, wounded him in the arm. However, all the con&s;pirators were now alarmed, and, inclo&s;ing him round, he received a &s;econd &s;tab from an unknown hand in the brea&s;t, while Ca&s;&s;ius wounded him in the face. He &s;till defended him&s;elf with great vigour, ru&s;hing among them, and throw|ing down &s;uch as oppo&s;ed him, till he &s;aw Brutus among the con&s;pirators, who, coming up, &s;truck his dagger into his thigh. From that moment Cae&s;ar thought no more of de|fending him&s;elf, but looking upon this con&s;pi|rator,
<PB N="27" REF="33">
cried out, "And you too, my &s;on!" Then covering his head, and &s;preading his robe before him, in order to fall with greater decency, he &s;unk down at the ba&s;e of Pompey's &s;tatue, after receiving three and twenty wounds from hands which he vainly &s;uppo&s;ed he had di&s;|armed by his benefits.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar was killed in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age, and about fourteen years after he began the conque&s;t of the world. If we examine his hi&s;tory, we &s;hall be equally at a lo&s;s whether mo&s;t to admire his great abilities or his won|derful fortune. To pretend to &s;ay that from the beginning he planned the &s;ubjection of his native country, is doing no great credit to his well-known penetration, as a thou&s;and ob&s;ta|cles lay in his way, which fortune, rather than conduct, was to &s;urmount. No man, therefore, of his &s;agacity, would have begun a &s;cheme in which the chances of &s;ucceeding were &s;o many again&s;t him: it is mo&s;t probable that, like all very &s;ucce&s;sful men, he only made the be&s;t of every occurrence; and his ambition ri&s;ing with his good fortune, from at fir&s;t, being contented with humbler aims, he at la&s;t began to think of governing the world, when he found &s;carce any ob&s;tacle to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of man, who&s;e cravings after power are always mo&s;t in&s;atiable when he enjoys the greate&s;t &s;hare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. From the death of Cae&s;ar to the battle of Actium and the death of Anthony, which &s;ettled the con&s;titution in Augu&s;tus.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="710" UNIT="U. C."> UPON the death of Cae&s;ar a conjuncture happened which was never known before; there was no longer any tyrant, and yet liberty was extingui&s;hed; for the cau&s;es which had con|tributed to its de&s;truction &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted to pre|vent its revival. The &s;enate had made an ill u&s;e of their power in the times of Sylla, and the people &s;huddered at the thought of tru&s;ting them with it once more.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the con&s;pirators had di&s;patched Cae&s;ar, they began to addre&s;s them&s;elves to the &s;enate in order to vindicate the motives of their enterpri&s;e, and to excite them to join in pro|curing their country's freedom: but the uni|ver&s;al coldne&s;s with which their expo&s;tulations were received, &s;oon taught them to fear their conduct would not meet with many advocates. All the &s;enators who were not accomplices fled with &s;uch precipitation that the lives of &s;ome of them were endangered in the throng. The people al&s;o being now alarmed, left their u&s;ual
<PB N="29" REF="35">
occupations, and ran tumultuou&s;ly through the the city; &s;ome actuated by their fears, and &s;till more by a de&s;ire of plunder. In this &s;tate of confu&s;ion the con&s;pirators all retired to the Ca|pitol, and guarded its acce&s;&s;es by a body of gladiators which Brutus had in pay. It was in vain they alledged that they only &s;truck for freedom, and that they killed a tyrant who had u&s;urped the rights of mankind: the people, accu&s;tomed to luxury and ea&s;e, little regarded their profe&s;&s;ions, dreading more the dangers of poverty than of &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>The friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for coming into greater power than before, and for &s;atisfying their ambition under the veil of promoting ju|&s;tice. Of this number was Anthony, whom we have already &s;een acting as a lieutenant under Cae&s;ar, and governing Rome in his ab&s;ence with &s;uch little ju&s;tice or decency. He was a man of moderate abilities and exce&s;&s;ive vices, ambitious of power only becau&s;e it gave his plea|&s;ures a wider range to riot in; but &s;killed in war, to which he had been trained from his youth. He was con&s;ul for this year, and re|&s;olved, with Lepidus, who was fond of com|motions like him&s;elf, to &s;eize this opportunity of gaining that power which Cae&s;ar had died for u&s;urping. Lepidus, therefore, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Forum with a band of &s;oldiers at
<PB N="30" REF="36">
his devotion; and Anthony, being con&s;ul, was permitted to command them. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all Cae&s;ar's papers and money, and the next to convene the &s;enate. Never had this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly been convened upon &s;o delicate an occa&s;ion, as it was to deter|mine whether Cae&s;ar had been a legal magi&s;|trate or a tyrannical u&s;urper; and whether tho&s;e who killed him merited rewards or puni&s;h|ments. There were many of the&s;e who had received all their promotions from Cae&s;ar, and had acquired large fortunes in con&s;equence of his appointments: to vote him an u&s;urper, there|fore, would be to endanger their property, and yet to vote him innocent might endanger the &s;tate. In this dilemma they &s;eemed willing to reconcile extremes; wherefore they approved all the acts of Cae&s;ar, and yet granted a general pardon to all the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>This decree was very far from giving An|thony &s;atisfaction, as it granted &s;ecurity to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny, and who would be foremo&s;t in op|po&s;ing his &s;chemes of re&s;toring ab&s;olute power. As therefore the &s;enate had ratified all Cae&s;ar's acts without di&s;tinction, he formed a &s;cheme upon this of making him rule when dead as imperiou&s;ly as he had done when living. Being, as was &s;aid, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Cae&s;ar's books of ac|counts, he &s;o far gained upon his &s;ecretary as

to make him in&s;ert whatever he thought pro|per. By the&s;e means great &s;ums of money, which Cae&s;ar would never have be&s;towed, were here di&s;tributed among the people; and every man who had any &s;editious de&s;igns again&s;t the government was here &s;ure of finding a gra|tuity. Things being in this forwardne&s;s he de|manded that Cae&s;ar's funeral ob&s;equies &s;hould be performed, which the &s;enate now could not decently forbid, as they had never declared him a tyrant: accordingly the body was brought forth into the Forum with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity; and Anthony, who charged him&s;elf with the&s;e la&s;t duties of friend&s;hip, began his operations upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the people by the prevailing motives of private intere&s;t. He fir&s;t read them Cae&s;ar's will, in which he had left Octavius, his &s;i&s;ter's grand&s;on, his heir, permitting him to take the name of Cae&s;ar; and three parts of his private fortune Brutus was to inherit in ca&s;e of his death. The Roman peo|ple were left the gardens which he had on the other &s;ide of the Tyber; and every citizen, in particular, was to receive three hundred &s;e&s;|terces. This la&s;t beque&s;t not a little con|tributed to increa&s;e the people's affection for their late dictator; they now began to con&s;ider Cae&s;ar as a father, who, not &s;atisfied with doing them the greate&s;t good while living, thought of benefiting them even after death. As Anthony
<PB N="32" REF="38">
continued reading, the multitude began to be moved, and &s;ighs and lamentations were heard from every quarter. Anthony &s;eeing the au|dience favourable to his de&s;igns, now began to addre&s;s the a&s;&s;embly in a more pathetic &s;train; he pre&s;ented before them Cae&s;ar's bloody robe, and, as he unfolded it, took care they &s;hould ob&s;erve the number of &s;tabs in it: then di&s;play|ing an image which to them appeared the body of Cae&s;ar all covered with wounds; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This," cried he, "this is all that is left of him who was befriended by the gods, and loved by mankind even to adoration.

Behold now the execution of the&s;e vows: behold here the proofs of our gratitude! The brave&s;t of men de&s;troyed by the mo&s;t ungrateful of mankind!

intentions."</Q> The people could now no lon|ger contain their indignation; they unanimou&s;ly cried out for revenge; all the old &s;oldiers who had fought under him burnt, with his body, their coronets, and other marks of conque&s;t with which he had honoured them. A great number of the fir&s;t matrons in the city threw in their ornaments al&s;o; till at length rage &s;uc|ceeding to &s;orrow, the multitude ran, with flam|ing brands, from the pile to &s;et fire to the con|&s;pirators hou&s;es. In this rage of re&s;entment, meeting with one Cinna&punc; whom they mi&s;took for another of the &s;ame name who was in the con&s;piracy, they tore him in pieces. The con|&s;pirators them&s;elves, however, being well guard|ed, repul&s;ed the multitude with no great trou|ble; but perceiving the rage of the people, they thought it, &s;oon after, &s;afe&s;t to retire from the city. The populace being thus left to them&s;elves, &s;et no bounds to their &s;orrow and gratitude. Divine honours were granted him; an altar was erected on the place where his body was burnt, where, afterwards, was erected a column in&s;cribed to the father of his country.</P>
<P>In the mean time Anthony, who had excited this flame, re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of the oc|ca&s;ion. Having gained the people by his zeal in Cae&s;ar's cau&s;e, he next endeavoured to bring over the &s;enate by a &s;eeming concern for the freedom of the &s;tate. He therefore propo&s;ed
<PB N="34" REF="40">
to recall Sextus, Pompey's only remaining &s;on, who had concealed him&s;elf in Spain &s;ince the death of his father; and to grant him the command of all the fleets of the empire. His next &s;tep to their confidence, was the quelling a &s;edition of the people who ro&s;e to revenge the death of Cae&s;ar, and putting their leader Ama|thus to death, who pretended to be the &s;on of Marius. He, after this, pretended to dread the re&s;entment of the multitude, and demand|ed a guard for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on. The &s;enate granted his reque&s;t, and, under this pretext, he drew round him a body of &s;ix thou|&s;and re&s;olute men, attached to his intere&s;t, and ready to execute his commands. Thus he con|tinued every day making rapid &s;trides to ab&s;o|lute power; all the authority of government was lodged in his hands, and tho&s;e of his two brothers alone, who &s;hared among them the con&s;ular, tribunitian, and praetorian power. His vows to revenge Cae&s;ar's death &s;eemed ei|ther po&s;tponed, or totally forgotten; and his only aims &s;eemed to be to confirm him&s;elf in that power, which he had thus artfully acquired. But an ob&s;tacle to his ambition &s;eemed to ari&s;e from a quarter on which he lea&s;t expected it. This was from Octavius Cae&s;ar, afterwards call|ed Augu&s;tus, as we &s;hall henceforth take leave to call him, though he did not receive the title till long after. Augu&s;tus, who was the grand
<PB N="35" REF="41">
nephew, and adopted &s;on of Cae&s;ar, was at Ap|pollonia when his kin&s;man was &s;lain. He was then but eighteen years old, and had been &s;ent to that city to improve him&s;elf in the &s;tudy of Grecian literature. Upon the news of Cae&s;ar's death, notwith&s;tanding the earne&s;t di&s;&s;ua&s;ions of all his friends, he re&s;olved to return to Rome, to claim the inheritance, and revenge the death of his uncle. From the former pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Anthony, he expected to find him a warm a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his aims; and he doubted not, by his concurrence, to take &s;ignal vengeance on all who had a hand in the con&s;piracy. However, he was greatly di&s;appointed. An|thony, who&s;e projects were all to aggrandize him|&s;elf, gave him but a very cold reception, and, in&s;tead of granting him the fortune left him by the will, delayed the payment of it upon va|rious pretences, hoping to check his ambition, by limiting his circum&s;tances. But Augu&s;tus &s;eems to have inherited, not only the wealth, but the inclinations of his uncle; in&s;tead, there|fore, of abating his claims, he even &s;old his own patrimonial e&s;tate, to pay &s;uch legacies as Cae&s;ar had left, and particularly that to the people. By the&s;e means he gained a degree of populari|ty, which his enemies vainly laboured to dimi|ni&s;h, and which, in fact, he had many other methods to procure. His conver&s;ation was elegant and in&s;inuating, his face comely and
<PB N="36" REF="42">
graceful, and his affection to the late dictator &s;o &s;incere, that every per&s;on was charmed, ei|ther with his piety or his addre&s;s. But what add|ed &s;till more to his intere&s;t was, the name of Cae&s;ar, which he had a&s;&s;umed, and, in con&s;e|quence of which, the former followers of his uncle now flocked in great numbers to him. All the&s;e he managed with &s;uch art, that, while he gained their affections, he never lo&s;t their e&s;teem; &s;o that Anthony now began to conceive a violent jealou&s;y for the talents of his young opponent, and &s;ecretly laboured to counteract all his de&s;igns. In fact, he did not want rea&s;on; for the army near Rome, that had long wi&s;hed to &s;ee the con&s;pirators puni&s;h|ed, began to turn from him to his rival, whom they &s;aw more &s;incerely bent on gratifying their de&s;ires. Anthony having al&s;o procured the go|vernment of Hither Gaul from the people, two of his legions, that he had brought home from his former government of Macedonia, went over to Augu&s;tus, notwith&s;tanding all his re|mon&s;trances to detain them. This produced, as u&s;ual, interviews, complaints, recrimina|tions, and pretended reconciliations, which on|ly tended to widen the difference; &s;o that, at length, both &s;ides prepared for war. Thus the &s;tate was divided into three di&s;tinct factions: that of Augu&s;tus, who aimed at procuring Cae|&s;ar's inheritance, and revenging his death;
<PB N="37" REF="43">
that of Anthony, who&s;e &s;ole view was to obtain ab&s;olute power; and that of the con&s;pirators, who endeavoured to re&s;tore the &s;enate to its former authority.</P>
<P>Anthony being rai&s;ed by the people to his new government of Ci&s;alpine Gaul, contrary to the inclinations of the &s;enate, re&s;olved to enter up|on his province immediately, and oppo&s;e Bru|tus, who commanded a &s;mall body of troops there, while his army was yet entire. He ac|cordingly left Rome, and marching thither, commanded Brutus to depart. Brutus, being unable to oppo&s;e him, retired with his forces; but being pur&s;ued by Anthony, he was at la&s;t be&s;ieged in the city of Mutina, of which he &s;ent word to the &s;enate.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Augu&s;tus, who, by this time, had rai&s;ed a body of ten thou&s;and men, returned to Rome; and, being re&s;olved, be|fore he attempted to take vengeance on the con&s;pirators, if po&s;&s;ible, to dimini&s;h the power of Anthony, began, by bringing over the &s;enate to &s;econd his de&s;igns. In this he &s;uc|ceeded, by the credit of Cicero, who long had hated Anthony, becau&s;e he thought him the enemy of the &s;tate. Accordingly, by means of his great eloquence, a decree was pa&s;&s;ed, ordering Anthony to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Mutina, to evacuate Ci&s;alpine Gaul, and to await the further orders of the &s;enate upon the banks of
<PB N="38" REF="44">
the Rubicon. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of government in Rome, a commander, at the head of a victorious army, would pay little attention to an ineffective de|cree. Anthony treated the order with contempt, and, in&s;tead of obeying, began to profe&s;s his di&s;plea&s;ure at being hitherto &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. Nothing now therefore remained for the &s;e|nate, but to declare him an enemy to the &s;tate, and to &s;end Augu&s;tus, with the army he had rai&s;ed, to curb his in&s;olence. Augu&s;tus was very ready to offer his army for this expedition, in order to puni&s;h his own private injuries, be|fore he undertook tho&s;e of the public. The two con&s;uls, Hirtius and Pan&s;a, joined al&s;o their forces, and thus combined, they marched, at the head of a numerous army, again&s;t Anthony, into Ci&s;alpine Gaul. He, on his part, was not &s;low in oppo&s;ing them. After one or two in|effectual conflicts, both armies came to a gene|ral engagement; in which Anthony was de|feated, and compelled to fly to Lepidus, who commanded a body of forces in Further Gaul. This victory, however, which promi&s;ed the &s;enate &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, produced effects very different from their expectations. The two con&s;uls were mortally wounded; but Pan&s;a, previous to his death, calling Augu&s;tus to his bed-&s;ide, advi&s;ed him to join with Anthony, telling him, that the &s;enate only de&s;ired to de|pre&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="45">
both, by oppo&s;ing them to each other. The advice of the dying con&s;ul &s;unk deep on the &s;pirits of Augu&s;tus; &s;o that, from that time, he only &s;ought a pretext to break with them. Their giving the command of a part of his ar|my to Decimus Brutus, and their denying him a triumph &s;oon after, &s;erved to alienate his mind entirely from them, and made him re|&s;olve to join Anthony and Lepidus. He was willing, however, to try the &s;enate thorough|ly, before he came to an open rupture; where|fore, he &s;ent to demand the con&s;ul&s;hip, which was refu&s;ed him. He then thought him&s;elf obliged to keep no mea&s;ures with that a&s;&s;em|bly, but privately &s;ent to &s;ound the inclinations of Anthony and Lepidus, concerning a junction of forces, and found them as eager to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as the &s;enate was to oppo&s;e him. Anthony was, in fact, the general of both armies, and Lepi|dus was only nominally &s;o, his &s;oldiers refu&s;ing to obey him upon the approach of the former. Wherefore, upon being a&s;&s;ured of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Augu&s;tus, upon their arrival in Italy, they &s;oon cro&s;&s;ed the Alps, with an army of &s;even|teen legions, breathing revenge again&s;t all who had oppo&s;ed their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The &s;enate now began, too late, to perceive their error, in offering to di&s;oblige Augu&s;tus; they therefore gave him the con&s;ul&s;hip, which they had &s;o lately refu&s;ed, and, to prevent his
<PB N="40" REF="46">
joining with Anthony, flattered him with new honours, and gave him a power &s;uperior to all law. The fir&s;t u&s;e Augu&s;tus made of his new authority was, to procure a law for the condem|nation of Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, and, in &s;hort, to join his forces with tho&s;e of Anthony and Le|pidus.</P>
<P>The meeting of the&s;e three u&s;urpers of their country's freedom was near Mutina, upon a little i&s;land of the river Panarus. Their mutual &s;u&s;picions were the cau&s;e of their meeting in a place where they could not fear any treachery; for, even in their union, they could not dive&s;t them&s;elves of mutual diffidence. Lepidus fir&s;t entered, and, finding all things &s;afe, made the &s;ignal for the other two to approach. They embraced each other upon their fir&s;t meeting, and Augu&s;tus began the conference, by thank|ing Anthony for his zeal, in putting Decimus Brutus to death, who, being abandoned by his army, was taken, as he was de&s;igning to e&s;cape into Macedonia, and beheaded by Anthony's command. They then entered upon the bu&s;i|ne&s;s that lay before them, without any retro&s;pec|tion of the pa&s;t. Their conference la&s;ted for three days, and, in this period, they fixed a di|vi&s;ion of government, and determined upon the &s;ate of thou&s;ands. One can &s;carce avoid wondering, how that city, which gave birth to &s;uch men as Fabricius and Cato, could now be
<PB N="41" REF="47">
a tame &s;pectator of a conference, which barter|ed away the lives and liberties of the people at their plea&s;ure. To &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e three men &s;eated, without attendants, on the highe&s;t part of a de&s;olate i&s;land, marking out whole cities and nations for de&s;truction, and yet none to oppo&s;e their de&s;igns, &s;hews what changes may quickly be wrought in the brave&s;t people in a very &s;hort time. The re&s;ult of their conference was, that the &s;upreme authority &s;hould be lodged in their hands, under the title of the Triumvirate, for the &s;pace of five years; that Anthony &s;hould have Gaul; Lepidus, Spain; and Augu&s;tus, Africa, and the Mediterranean i&s;lands. As for Italy, and the ea&s;tern provinces, they were to remain in common, until their general enemy was entirely &s;ubdued. But the la&s;t article of their union was a dreadful one: It was agreed, that all their enemies &s;hould be de&s;troyed, of which each pre&s;ented a li&s;t. In the&s;e were compri&s;ed, not only the enemies, but the friends of the Triumvirate, &s;ince the parti&s;ans of the one were often found among the oppo&s;ers of the other. Thus Lepidus gave up his bro|ther Paulus to the vengeance of his colleague; Anthony permitted the pro&s;cription of his uncle Lucius; and Augu&s;tus delivered up the great Cicero. The mo&s;t &s;acred rights of nature were violated; three hundred &s;enators, and above two thou&s;and knights, were included in this
<PB N="42" REF="48">
terrible pro&s;cription; their fortunes were con|fi&s;cated, and their murderers enriched with the &s;poil. Rome &s;oon felt the effects of this infer|nal union: nothing but cries and lamentations were to be heard through all the city, &s;carce an hou&s;e e&s;caping without a murder. No man dar|ed to refu&s;e entrance to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, although he had no other hopes of &s;afety; and this city, that was once the beauty of the world, &s;eemed now reduced to de&s;olation without an army; and now felt the effects of an invading ene|my, with all the deliberate malice of cool|blooded &s;laughter.</P>
<P>In this horrid carnage, Cicero was one of tho&s;e principally &s;ought after, who, for a while, &s;eemed to evade the malice of his pur&s;uers; but upon hearing of the &s;laughters that were com|mitted at Rome, he &s;et forward from his Tu&s;|culan villa, towards the &s;ea-&s;ide, with an intent to tran&s;port him&s;elf directly out of the reach of his enemies. There finding a ve&s;&s;el ready, he pre&s;ently embarked; but the winds being aver&s;e, and the &s;ea wholly unea&s;y to him, after he had &s;ailed about two leagues along the coa&s;t, he was obliged to land, and &s;pend the night upon &s;hore. From thence he was forced, by the importunity of his &s;ervants, on board again, but was &s;oon after obliged to land at a country &s;eat of his, a mile from the &s;hore, weary of life, and declaring he was re&s;olved to
<PB N="43" REF="49">
die in that country which he had &s;o often &s;aved. Here he &s;lept &s;oundly for &s;ome time, till his &s;ervants once more forced him away in a litter towards the &s;hip, having heard that he was pur&s;ued by a party of Anthony's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. They were &s;carce departed, when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ar|rived at his hou&s;e, and, perceiving him to be fled, pur&s;ued him immediately towards the &s;ea, and overtook him in a wood that lay near the &s;hore. Their leader was one Popilius Lenus, a tribune of the army, who&s;e life Cicero had formerly defended and &s;aved. As &s;oon as the &s;oldiers appeared, the &s;ervants prepared to defend their ma&s;ter's life, at the hazard of their own; but Cicero commanded them to &s;et him down, and to make no re&s;i&s;tance. They &s;oon cut off his head and his hands, returning with them to Rome, as the mo&s;t agreeable pre&s;ent to their cruel employer. Anthony, who was then at Rome, received them with extreme joy, reward|ed the murderer with a large &s;um of money, and placed Cicero's head on the ro&s;trum, as if there once more to reproach his vile inhuma|nity. Cicero was &s;lain in the &s;ixty-third year of his age, but not until he had &s;een his country ruined before him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The glory he obtained," &s;ays Julius Cae&s;ar, "was as much above all other triumphs, as the extent of the Roman genius was above that of the bounds of the Roman empire."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50">
Thus the pro&s;cription went on to rage for &s;ome time with as much violence as when it began. As many as could e&s;cape its cruelty fled either into Macedonia to Brutus, or found refuge with young Pompey, who was now in Sicily, and covered the Mediterranean with his numerous navy. Their cruelties were not aimed at the men alone; but the &s;ofter &s;ex were in danger of being marked as objects ei|ther of avarice or re&s;entment. They made out a li&s;t of fourteen hundred women of the be&s;t quality, and the riche&s;t in the city, who were ordered to give in an account of their fortunes, to be taxed in proportion. But this &s;eemed &s;o unpopular a mea&s;ure, and was &s;o firmly oppo&s;ed by Horten&s;ia, who &s;poke again&s;t it, that, in|&s;tead of fourteen hundred women, they were content to tax only four hundred. However, they made up the deficiency, by extending the tax upon men; near an hundred thou&s;and, as well citizens as &s;trangers, were compelled to furni&s;h &s;upplies, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of their country's freedom. At la&s;t, both the avarice and vengeance of the Triumviri &s;eemed fully &s;atisfied, and they went into the &s;enate to de|clare that the pro&s;cription was at an end; and thus having deluged the city with blood, Au|gu&s;tus and Anthony, leaving Lepidus to de|fend Rome in their ab&s;ence, marched with their army to oppo&s;e the con&s;pirators, who
<PB N="45" REF="51">
were now at the head of a formidable army in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, the principal of the&s;e, upon the death of Cae&s;ar, being compelled to quit Rome, went into Greece, where they per|&s;uaded the Roman &s;tudents at Athens to declare in the cau&s;e of freedom; then parting, the former rai&s;ed a powerful army in Macedonia, and the adjacent countries, while the latter went into Syria, where he &s;oon became ma&s;ter of twelve legions, and reduced his opponent, Dollabella, to &s;uch &s;treights as to kill him&s;elf. Both armies &s;oon after joining at Smyrna, the &s;ight of &s;uch a formidable force began to re|vive the declining &s;pirits of the party, and to reunite the two generals &s;till more clo&s;ely, be|tween whom there had been, &s;ome time before, a &s;light mi&s;under&s;tanding. In &s;hort, having quitted Italy like di&s;tre&s;&s;ed exiles, without having one &s;ingle &s;oldier or one town that own|ed their command, they now found them&s;elves at the head of a flouri&s;hing army, furni&s;hed with all the nece&s;&s;aries for carrying on the war, and in a condition to &s;upport a conte&s;t where the empire of the world depended on the event. This &s;ucce&s;s in rai&s;ing levies was entirely owing to the ju&s;tice, moderation, and great huma|nity of Brutus, who, in every in&s;tance, &s;eemed &s;tudious of the happine&s;s of his country, and not his own.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52">
It was in this flouri&s;hing &s;tate of their affairs, that the con&s;pirators had formed a re&s;olution of going again&s;t Cleopatra, who, on her &s;ide, had made great preparations to a&s;&s;i&s;t their op|ponents. However, they were diverted from this purpo&s;e by an information that Augu&s;tus and Anthony were now upon their march, with forty legions, to oppo&s;e them. Brutus now, therefore, moved to have their army pa&s;s over into Greece and Macedonia, and there meet the enemy; but Ca&s;&s;ius &s;o far prevailed, as to have the Rhodians and Lycians fir&s;t reduced, who had refu&s;ed their u&s;ual contributions. This expedition was immediately put in exe|cution, and extraordinary contributions were rai&s;ed by that means, the Rhodians having &s;carce any thing left them but their lives. The Lycians &s;uffered &s;till more &s;everely; for, hav|ing &s;hut them&s;elves up in the city of Xanthius, they defended the place again&s;t Brutus with &s;uch fury, that neither his arts nor entreaties could prevail upon them to &s;urrender. At length, the town being &s;et on fire, by their at|tempting to burn the works of the Romans, Brutus, in&s;tead of laying hold on this opportu|nity to &s;torm the place, made every effort to pre&s;erve it, entreating his &s;oldiers to try all means of extingui&s;hing the fire: but the de&s;pe|rate phrenzy of the citizens was not to be mol|lified. Far from thinking them&s;elves obliged
<PB N="47" REF="53">
to their generous enemy, for the efforts which were made to &s;ave them, they re&s;olved to peri&s;h in the flames. Wherefore, in&s;tead of extin|gui&s;hing, they did all in their power to aug|ment the fire, by throwing in wood, dry reeds, and all kinds of fuel. Nothing could exceed the di&s;tre&s;s of Brutus, upon &s;eeing the town&s;men thus re&s;olutely bent on de&s;troying them&s;elves; he rode about the fortifications, &s;tretching out his hands to the Xanthians, and conjuring them to have pity on them&s;elves and their city; but, in&s;en&s;ible to his expo&s;tulations, they ru&s;h|ed into the flames with de&s;perate ob&s;tinacy, and the whole &s;oon became an heap of undi&s;|tingui&s;hable ruin. At this horrid &s;pectacle Brutus melted into tears, offering a reward to every &s;oldier who &s;hould bring him a Lycian alive. The number of tho&s;e whom it was po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ave from their own fury amounted to no more than one hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius met once more at Sardis, where, after the u&s;ual ceremonies were pa&s;t be|tween them, they re&s;olved to have a private conference together. They &s;hut them&s;elves up therefore, in the fir&s;t convenient hou&s;e, with expre&s;s orders to their &s;ervants to give no admi&s;&s;ion. Brutus began, by reprimanding Ca&s;&s;ius for having di&s;po&s;ed of offices, which &s;hould ever be the reward of merit, and for having overtaxed the tributary &s;tates. Ca&s;&s;ius
<PB N="48" REF="54">
retorted the imputation of avarice with the more bitterne&s;s, as he knew the charge to be ground|le&s;s. The debate grew warm, till, from loud &s;peaking, they bur&s;t into tears. Their friends, who were &s;tanding at the door, overheard the increa&s;ing vehemence of their voices, and be|gan to dread for the con&s;equences, till Favo|nius, who valued him&s;elf upon a cynical bold|ne&s;s, that knew no re&s;traint, entering the room with a je&s;t, calmed their mutual animo&s;ity. Ca&s;|&s;ius was ready enough to forego his anger, being a man of great abilities, but of uneven di&s;po&s;ition, not aver&s;e to plea&s;ure in private company, and, upon the whole, of morals not quite &s;incere. But the conduct of Brutus was always perfect|ly &s;teady. An even gentlene&s;s, a noble eleva|tion of &s;entiments, a &s;trength of mind, over which neither vice nor plea&s;ure could have any influence, an inflexible firmne&s;s in the defence of ju&s;tice, compo&s;ed the character of that great man. In con&s;equence of the&s;e qualities, he was beloved by his army, doated upon by his friends, and admired by all good men. After their conference, night coming on, Ca&s;&s;ius in|vited Brutus and his friends to an entertain|ment, where freedom and chearfulne&s;s, for a while, took place of political anxiety, and &s;oftened the &s;everity of wi&s;dom. Upon retir|ing home it was that Brutus, as Plutarch tells the &s;tory, &s;aw a &s;pectre in his tent. He natu|rally
<PB N="49" REF="55">
&s;lept but little, and he had encrea&s;ed this &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s by habit and great &s;obriety. He never allowed him&s;elf to &s;leep in the day time, as was then common in Rome; and only gave &s;o much of the night to &s;leep as could barely renew the natural functions. But e&s;pe|cially now, when oppre&s;t with &s;uch various cares, he only gave a &s;hort time after his nightly repa&s;t to re&s;t; and, waking about midnight, generally read or &s;tudied till morning. It was in the dead of the night, when the whole camp was perfectly quiet, that Brutus was thus em|ployed in reading by a lamp that was ju&s;t ex|piring. On a &s;udden he thought he heard a noi&s;e as if &s;ome body entered, and looking to|wards the door he perceived it open. A gi|gantic figure, with a frightful a&s;pect, &s;tood be|fore him, and continued to gaze upon him with &s;ilent &s;everity. At la&s;t Brutus had courage to &s;peak to it: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Art thou a daemon or a mortal man? and why come&s;t thou to me?" "Bru|tus," replied the phantom, "I am thy evil genius, thou &s;halt &s;ee me again at Philippi." Well, then," an&s;wered Brutus, without being di&s;compo&s;ed, "we &s;hall meet again."</Q>  Upon which the phantom vani&s;hed, and Brutus call|ing to his &s;ervants, a&s;ked if they had &s;een any thing; to which replying in the negative, he again re&s;umed his &s;tudies&punc; But as he was &s;truck with &s;o &s;trange an occurrence, he mentioned it
<PB N="50" REF="56">
the next day to Ca&s;&s;ius, who, being an Epicu|rean, a&s;cribed it to the effect of an imagination too much exerci&s;ed by vigilance and anxiety. Brutus appeared &s;atisfied with this &s;olution of his late terrors; and, as Anthony and Augu&s;tus were now advanced into Macedonia, they &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed over into Thrace, and advanced to the city of Philippi, near which the forces of the Triumviri were po&s;ted.</P>
<P>All mankind now began to regard the ap|proaching armies with terror and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The empire of the world depended upon the fate of a battle; as from victory on the one &s;ide they had to expect freedom; but from the other, a &s;overeign with ab&s;olute command. Brutus was the only man who looked upon the&s;e great events before him with calmne&s;s and tranquility. Indifferent as to &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;atisfied with having done his duty, he &s;aid to one of his friends, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I gain the victory, I &s;hall re&s;tore liberty to my country; if I lo&s;e it, by dying, I &s;hall be delivered from &s;lavery my&s;elf; my condition is fixed, and I run no hazards."</Q> The Republican army con&s;i&s;ted of four&s;core thou&s;and foot, and twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e. The army of the Triumviri amounted to an hundred thou&s;and foot, and thirteen thou&s;and hor&s;e. Thus complete, on both &s;ides, they met and encamped near each other upon the plains of Philippi, a city upon the confines of Thrace.
<PB N="51" REF="57">
This city was &s;ituated upon a mountain, to|wards the we&s;t of which a plain &s;tretched it&s;elf, by a gentle declivity, almo&s;t fifteen leagues to the banks of the river Strymon. In this plain, about two miles from the town, were two little hills at about a mile di&s;tance from each other, defended on one &s;ide by mountains, on the other by a mar&s;h which communicated with the &s;ea. It was upon the&s;e two hills that Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius fixed their camps: Brutus on the hill towards the north: Ca&s;&s;ius on that towards the &s;outh: and in the intermediate &s;pace which &s;eparated them, they ca&s;t up lines and a parapet from one hill to the other. Thus they kept a firm communication between the two camps, which mutually defended each other. In this commodious &s;ituation they could act as they thought proper, and give bat|tle only when it was to their advantage to en|gage. Behind them was the &s;ea, which fur|ni&s;hed them with all kinds of provi&s;ions; and at twelve miles di&s;tance the i&s;land of Tha&s;os, which &s;erved them for a general magazine. The Triumviri, on the other hand, were en|camped on the plain below, and were obliged to bring their provi&s;ions from fifteen leagues di&s;tance; &s;o that their &s;cheme and intere&s;t was to bring on a battle as &s;oon as they could. This they offered &s;everal times, drawing out their men from their camp, and provoking the enemy
<PB N="52" REF="58">
to engage. On the contrary, the&s;e contented them&s;elves with drawing up their troops at the head of their camps, but without de&s;cending to the plain. This re&s;olution of po&s;tponing the battle, was all that the Republican army had for it; and Ca&s;&s;ius, who was aware of his ad|vantage, re&s;olved to harra&s;s the enemy rather than engage them. But Brutus began to &s;u&s;|pect the fidelity of &s;ome of his officers, &s;o that he u&s;ed all his influence to per&s;uade Ca&s;&s;ius to change his re&s;olution. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am impatient," &s;aid he, "to put an end to the mi&s;eries of mankind, and in that I have hopes of &s;ucceeding whether I fall or conquer."</Q> His wi&s;hes were &s;oon gratified; for Anthony's &s;oldiers having, with great labour, made a road through the mar&s;h which lay to the left of Ca&s;&s;ius's camp, by that means opened a communication with the i&s;land of Tha&s;os, which lay behind him. Both armies, in attempting to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of this road, re&s;olved, at length, to come to a general engagement. This, how|ever, was contrary to the advice of Ca&s;&s;ius, who declared, that he was forced, as Pompey had formerly been, to expo&s;e the liberty of Rome to the hazard of a battle. The en&s;uing morn|ing the two generals gave the &s;ignal for engag|ing, and conferred together a little while before the battle began. Ca&s;&s;ius de&s;ired to know how Brutus intended to act in ca&s;e they were un|&s;ucce&s;sful:
<PB N="53" REF="59">
to which the other replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had formerly, in his writings, condemned the death of Cato, and maintained, that avoid|ing calamities by &s;uicide, was an in&s;olent at|tempt again&s;t Heaven that &s;ent them; but he had now altered his opinions, and, having given up his life to his country, he thought he had a right to his own way of ending it; wherefore he was re&s;olved to change a mi&s;e|rable being here, for a better hereafter if fortune proved again&s;t him." "Well &s;aid, my friend," cried Ca&s;&s;ius embracing him, now we may venture to face the enemy, for either we &s;hall be conquerors our&s;elves, or we &s;hall have no cau&s;e to fear tho&s;e that are &s;o."</Q> Augu&s;tus being &s;ick, the forces of the Triumviri were commanded alone by An|thony, who began the engagement by a vigor|ous attack upon the lines of Ca&s;&s;ius. Brutus, on the other &s;ide, made a dreadful irruption on the army of Augu&s;tus, and drove forward with &s;o much intrepidity, that he broke them upon the very fir&s;t charge. Upon this he penetrated as far as the camp, and cutting in pieces tho&s;e who were left for its defence, his troops immediately began to plunder: but in the mean time the lines of Ca&s;&s;ius were forced, and his cavalry put to flight. There was no effort that this unfor|tunate general did not try to make his infantry &s;tand, &s;topping tho&s;e that fled, and &s;eizing him|&s;elf
<PB N="54" REF="60">
the colours to rally them. But his own valour alone was not &s;ufficient to in&s;pire his ti|morous army. He &s;aw him&s;elf entirely routed, his camp taken, and him&s;elf obliged to retire under a little hill at &s;ome di&s;tance. Brutus, who had gained a complete victory, was ju&s;t returning at this interval with his triumphant army, when he found that all was lo&s;t on the part of his a&s;&s;ociate; he &s;ent out a body of ca|valry to bring him news of Ca&s;&s;ius, who, per|ceiving them advance towards him, &s;ent one Titinius to inform him&s;elf whether they were friends or enemies. Titinius &s;oon joined this body, who received him with great tran&s;port, informing him of their &s;ucce&s;s, but delaying too long, Ca&s;&s;ius began to mi&s;take them for what his fears had &s;ugge&s;ted, and crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he had expo&s;ed his deare&s;t friend to be taken pri&s;oner,"</Q> he retired to his tent with one of his freedmen, named Pindarus, who &s;lew him, and then was never heard of after. Titinius arrived in triumph with the body of hor&s;emen, but his joy was &s;oon turned into angui&s;h upon &s;eeing his friend dead in the tent before him; upon which, accu&s;ing his own delay as the cau&s;e, he puni&s;hed it with falling on his &s;word. Brutus was by this time in|formed of the defeat of Ca&s;&s;ius, and &s;oon after of his death as he drew near the camp. He &s;eemed &s;carce able to re&s;train the exce&s;s of his
<PB N="55" REF="61">
grief for a man whom he called the la&s;t of the Romans. He bathed the dead body with his tears; and, telling his friends that he thought Ca&s;&s;ius very happy in being beyond the reach of tho&s;e misfortunes which remained for them to &s;uffer, he ordered him to be pri|vately removed, le&s;t the knowledge of his death &s;hould de&s;pirit the army. It was only this pre|cipitate de&s;pair of Ca&s;&s;ius which gave the enemy the advantage, &s;ince, till then, the Republicans might be &s;aid to have the &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of Brutus, when he became the &s;ole general, was to a&s;&s;emble the di&s;per&s;t troops of Ca&s;&s;ius, and animate them with fre&s;h hopes of victory. As they had lo&s;t all they po&s;&s;e&s;t by the plundering of their camp, he pro|mi&s;ed them two thou&s;and denarii each man to make up their lo&s;&s;es. This once more in|&s;pired them with new ardour; they admired the liberality of their general, and with loud &s;houts proclaimed his former intrepidity. Still, however, he had not confidence &s;ufficient to face the adver&s;ary who offered him battle the en&s;uing day. His aim was to &s;tarve his enemies, who were in extreme want of provi&s;ions, their fleet having been lately defeated. But his &s;ingle opinion was over-ruled by the re&s;t of his army, who now grew every day more confident of their &s;trength, and more arrogant to their new general. He was, therefore, at la&s;t, after a
<PB N="56" REF="62">
re&s;pite of twenty days, obliged to comply with their &s;olicitations to try the fate of the battle. Both armies being drawn out, they remained a long while oppo&s;ite to each other without of|fering to engage. It is &s;aid that he him&s;elf had lo&s;t much of his natural ardour by having &s;een the &s;pectre the night preceding: however, he encouraged his men as much as po&s;&s;ible, and gave the &s;ignal for battle within three hours of &s;un-&s;et. He had, as u&s;ual, the advantage where he commanded in per&s;on; he bore down the enemy at the head of his infantry, and, &s;upported by his cavalry, made a very great &s;laughter. But his left wing, fearing to be taken in flank, &s;tretched it&s;elf out in order to enlarge its front, by means of which it became too weak to &s;tand the &s;hock of the enemy. It was there that the army of Brutus began to yield; and An|thony pu&s;hing forward, drove the enemy &s;o far back as to be able to turn and attack Brutus in the rear. The troops which had belonged to Ca&s;&s;ius communicated their terror to the re&s;t of the forces, till, at la&s;t, the whole army gave way. Brutus, &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t valiant of his officers, fought for a long time with amazing valour. The &s;on of Cato fell fighting by his &s;ide, as al&s;o the brother of Ca&s;&s;ius; &s;o that, at la&s;t, he was obliged to yield to nece&s;&s;ity, and fled. In the mean time the two Trium|viri, now a&s;&s;ured of victory, expre&s;sly ordered
<PB N="57" REF="63">
by no means to &s;uffer the general to e&s;cape, for fear he &s;hould renew the war. Thus the whole body of the enemy &s;eemed chiefly intent on Brutus alone, and his capture &s;eemed inevita|ble. In this deplorable exigence, Lucilius, his friend, was re&s;olved, by his own death, to effect his general's delivery. Upon perceiving a body of Thracian hor&s;e clo&s;ely pur&s;uing Bru|tus, and ju&s;t upon the point of taking him, he boldly threw him&s;elf in their way, telling them that he was Brutus. The Thracians, overjoyed with &s;o great a prize, immediately di&s;patched &s;ome of their companions, with the news of their &s;ucce&s;s, to the army. Upon which, the ardour of the pur&s;uit now abating, Anthony marched out to meet his pri&s;oner, and to ha&s;ten his death, or in&s;ult his misfortunes. He was fol|lowed by a great number of officers and &s;oldiers, &s;ome &s;ilently deploring the fate of &s;o virtuous a man; others reproaching that mean de&s;ire of life for which he con&s;ented to undergo capti|vity. Anthony now &s;eeing the Thracians ap|proach, began to prepare him&s;elf for the inter|view; but the faithful Lucilius, advancing with a chearful air, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is not Brutus," &s;aid he, "that is taken; fortune has not yet had the power of committing &s;o great an outrage upon virtue. As for my life it is well &s;pent in pre&s;erving his honour; take it, for I have deceived you."</Q> Anthony, &s;truck with &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="64">
fidelity, pardoned him upon the &s;pot; and from that time forward loaded him with be|nefits, and honoured him with his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the mean time Brutus, with a &s;mall num|ber of friends, pa&s;&s;ed over a rivulet, and, night coming on, &s;at down under a rock which con|cealed him from the pur&s;uit of the enemy. After taking breath for a little time, he ca&s;t his eyes up to Heaven, that was all &s;pangled with &s;tars; he repeated a line from Euripides, con|taining a wi&s;h to the Gods, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that guilt &s;hould not pa&s;s in this life without puni&s;hment."</Q> To this he added another from the &s;ame poet: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O virtue! thou empty name, I have wor|&s;hipped thee as a real good, but thou art only the &s;lave of fortune."</Q> He then called to mind, with great tenderne&s;s, tho&s;e whom he had &s;een peri&s;h in battle, and &s;ent out one Statilius to give him &s;ome information of tho&s;e that remained; but he never returned, being killed by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e. Brutus, judging very rightly of his fate, now re&s;olved to die likewi&s;e, and &s;poke to tho&s;e who &s;tood round him to lend him their la&s;t &s;ad a&s;&s;i&s;tance. None of them, however, would render him &s;o melancholly a piece of &s;ervice. Upon this, rai&s;ing him&s;elf up and &s;tretching out his hands, he &s;poke to them with a &s;erene countenance, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was happy in the fidelity of his friends; happy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="59" REF="65">
his own rectitude; and, though he fell, yet his death was more glorious than the triumphs of the enemy, &s;ince they were &s;ucce&s;sful in the cau&s;e of u&s;urpation, and he overthrown in the defence of virtue."</Q> He then retired to a little di&s;tance with one Strato, who was his ma&s;ter in oratory, and entreated him to do him the la&s;t office of friend&s;hip. Strato, how|ever, expre&s;t his reluctance in taking upon him &s;o &s;hocking an office. Brutus, therefore, &s;ee|ing him &s;o aver&s;e, called to one of his &s;laves to perform what he &s;o ardently de&s;ired; but Strato then offered him&s;elf, crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it &s;hould never be &s;aid that Brutus, in his la&s;t extremity, &s;tood in need of a &s;lave for want of a friend."</Q> Thus &s;aying, and averting his head, he pre&s;ented the &s;word's point to Brutus, who threw him&s;elf upon it, and immediately expired. Thus died Brutus, and with him all hopes of liberty in Rome. By this famous overthrow, the Triumviri became irre&s;i&s;table; and though Pompey's younger &s;on was &s;till alive, and at the head of a powerful army, yet, with the united forces of the empire again&s;t him, little could be expected from his greate&s;t efforts.</P>
<P>From the moment of Brutus's death, the Triumviri began to act as &s;overeigns, and to divide the Roman dominions between them, as theirs by right of conque&s;t. However, though
<PB N="50" REF="66">
there were apparently three who thus partici|pated all power, yet, in fact, only two were actually po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, &s;ince Lepidus was at fir&s;t admitted merely to curb the mutual jealou&s;y of Anthony and Augu&s;tus; and was po&s;&s;e&s;t neither of intere&s;t in the army, nor authority among the people. Their fir&s;t care was to puni&s;h tho&s;e whom they had formerly marked for vengeance. Horten&s;ius, Dru&s;us, and Quinti|lius Varus, all men of the fir&s;t rank in the com|monwealth, either killed them&s;elves or were &s;lain. A &s;enator and his &s;on were ordered to ca&s;t lots for their lives, but both refu&s;ed it; the father voluntarily gave him&s;elf up to the executioner, and the &s;on &s;tabbed him|&s;elf before his face. Another begged to have the rites of burial after his death; to which Augu&s;tus replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he &s;hould find a grave in the vultures that devoured him."</Q> But chiefly the people lamented to &s;ee the head of Brutus &s;ent to Rome to be thrown at the foot of Cae&s;ar's &s;tatue. His a&s;hes, however, were &s;ent to his wife Porcia, Cato's daughter, who, following the example of her hu&s;band and father, killed her&s;elf by &s;wallowing burning coals. It is ob&s;erved, that of all tho&s;e who had a hand in the death of Cae&s;ar, not one died a natural death.</P>
<P>The power of the Triumviri being thus e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon the ruin of the Commonwealth&punc;
<PB N="51" REF="67">
they now began to think of enjoying that ho|mage to which they had a&s;pired. Anthony went into Greece to receive the flattery of that refined people, and &s;pent &s;ome time at Athens, conver&s;ing among the philo&s;ophers, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing at their di&s;putes in per&s;on. From thence he pa&s;t over into A&s;ia, where all the monarchs of the Ea&s;t who acknowledged the Roman power, came to pay him their obedience, while the faire&s;t prince&s;&s;es &s;trove to gain his favour by the greatne&s;s of their pre&s;ents, or the allure|ments of their beauty. In this manner he pro|ceeded from kingdom to kingdom, attended by a crowd of &s;overeigns, exacting contributions, di&s;tributing favours, and giving away crowns with capricious in&s;olence. He pre&s;ented the kingdom of Cappadocia to Sy&s;enes, in preju|dice of Ariarathes, only becau&s;e he found plea|&s;ure in the beauty of Glaphyra, the mother of the former. He &s;ettled Herod in the kingdom of Judea, and &s;upported him again&s;t every oppo&s;er. But among all the &s;overeigns of the Ea&s;t who &s;hared his favours, none had &s;o large a part as Cleopatra, the celebrated queen of Egypt.</P>
<P>It happened that Serapion, her governor in the i&s;land of Cyprus, had formerly furni&s;hed &s;ome &s;uccours to the con&s;pirators; and it was thought proper that &s;he &s;hould an&s;wer for his conduct on that occa&s;ion. Accordingly, having received
<PB N="62" REF="68">
orders from Anthony to come and clear her&s;elf of this imputation of infidelity, &s;he readily com|plied, equally con&s;cious of the goodne&s;s of her cau&s;e, and the power of her beauty. She had already experienced the force of her charms upon Cae&s;ar and Pompey's elde&s;t &s;on; and the addition of a few years &s;ince that time, only &s;erved to heighten their lu&s;tre. She was now in her twenty-&s;eventh year, and con&s;equently improved tho&s;e allurements by art, which, in earlier age, are &s;eldom attended to. Her addre&s;s and wit were &s;till further heightened, and, though there were &s;ome women in Rome that were her equals in beauty, none could rival her in the charms of &s;educing conver&s;ation. Anthony was now in Tar&s;us, a city of Cilicia, when Cleopatra re&s;olved to attend his court in per&s;on. She &s;ailed down the river Cydnus, at the mouth of which the city &s;tood, with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous pageantry. Her galley was covered with gold, the &s;ails of purple, large, and floating in the wind. The oars, of &s;ilver, kept tune to the &s;ound of flutes and cymbals. She her&s;elf lay reclined on a couch &s;pangled with &s;tars of gold, and with &s;uch ornaments as poets and painters had u&s;ually a&s;cribed to Venus. On each &s;ide were boys like Cupids, who fanned her by turns; while the mo&s;t beautiful nymphs, dre&s;t like Neriads and graces, were placed at proper di&s;tances around her. Upon the banks
<PB N="63" REF="69">
of the river were kept burning the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite perfumes, while an infinite number of people gazed upon the &s;ight with a mixture of delight and admiration. So &s;oon after relating the death of Brutus, I fancy it will give the reader but very little plea&s;ure minutely to de|&s;cribe the triumphs of vice and infamy; &s;uffice it therefore to &s;ay, that Anthony was captivated with her beauty, and, leaving all his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hortly after followed her into Egypt. Here he continued in all that ea&s;e and &s;oftne&s;s to which his vicious heart was prone, and which that luxurious people were able to &s;upply.</P>
<P>While he remained thus idle in Egypt, Au|gu&s;tus, who took upon him to lead back the veteran troops and &s;ettle them in Italy, was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in providing for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. He had promi&s;ed them lands at home, as a recompence for their pa&s;t &s;ervices, but they could not receive their new grants without turning out the former inhabitants. In con&s;e|quence of this, multitudes of women, with children in their arms, who&s;e tender years and innocence excited univer&s;al compa&s;&s;ion, daily filled the temples and the &s;treets with their di|&s;tre&s;&s;es. Numbers of hu&s;bandmen and &s;hep|herds came to deprecate the conqueror's in|tention, or to obtain an habitation in &s;ome other part of the world. Among this number
<PB N="64" REF="70">
was Virgil, the poet, to whom mankind owe more obligations, than to a thou&s;and conque|rors, who, in an humble manner, begged per|mi&s;&s;ion to retain his patrimonial farm: Virgil obtained his reque&s;t, but the re&s;t of his coun|trymen, of Mantua and Cremona, were turned out without mercy.</P>
<P>Italy and Rome now felt the mo&s;t extreme mi&s;eries; the in&s;olent &s;oldiers plundered at will; while Sextus Pompey, being ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, cut off all foreign communication, and prevented the people's receiving their u&s;ual &s;upplies of corn. To the&s;e mi&s;chiefs were added the commencement of another civil war. Fulvia, the wife of Anthony, who had been left behind him at Rome, had felt for &s;ome time all the rage of jealou&s;y, and re&s;olved to try every method of bringing back her hu&s;band from the arms of Cleopatra. She con&s;idered a breach with Augu&s;tus, as the only proba|ble means of rouzing him from his lethargy; and, accordingly, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lucius, her brother-in-law, who was then con&s;ul, and entirely devoted to her intere&s;t, &s;he began to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The pretext was, that Anthony &s;hould have a &s;hare in the di&s;tri|bution of lands as well as Augu&s;tus; this pro|duced &s;ome negotiations between them; Au|gu&s;tus offered to make the veterans them&s;elves umpires in the di&s;pute. Lucius refu&s;ed to ac|quie&s;ce;

and, being at the head of more than &s;ix legions, mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of &s;uch as were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t, he re&s;olved to compel Augu&s;tus to accept of whatever terms he &s;hould offer. Thus a new war was excited between Augu&s;tus and Anthony; or, at lea&s;t, the generals of the latter a&s;&s;umed the &s;anction of his name. Augu&s;tus, however, was victorious: Lucius was hemmed in between two armies, and con&s;trained to re|treat to Peru&s;ia, a city of Etruria, where he was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by the oppo&s;ite party. He made many de&s;perate &s;allies, and Fulvia did all in her power to relieve him, but without &s;ucce&s;s. He was at la&s;t, therefore, reduced to &s;uch extremity, by famine, that he came out in per&s;on, and delivered him&s;elf up to the mercy of the conqueror. Augu&s;tus received him very honourably, and generou&s;ly pardoned him and all his followers. Thus having con|cluded the war in a few months, he returned in triumph to Rome to receive new marks of adulation from the ob&s;equious &s;enate.</P>
<P>Anthony, who, during this interval, was re|velling in all the &s;tudied luxuries procured him by his in&s;idious mi&s;tre&s;s, having heard of his bro|ther's overthrow, and his wife's being com|pelled to leave Italy, was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e Augu&s;tus without delay. He accordingly &s;ailed, at the head of a con&s;iderable fleet, from Alex|andria to Tyre; from thence to Cyprus and
<PB N="66" REF="72">
Rhodes, and had an interview with Fulvia, his wife, at Athens. He much blamed her for oc|ca&s;ioning the late di&s;orders, te&s;tified the utmo&s;t contempt for her per&s;on, and, leaving her upon her death-bed, at Sycion, ha&s;tened into Italy to fight Augu&s;tus. They both met at Brundu|&s;ium; and it was now thought that the flames of a civil-war were going to blaze out once more. The forces of Anthony were numerous, but mo&s;tly newly rai&s;ed; however, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sextus Pompeius, who, in the&s;e op|po&s;itions of intere&s;t, was daily coming into power. Augu&s;tus was at the head of tho&s;e ve|terans, who had always been irre&s;i&s;tible, but who &s;eemed no way di&s;po&s;ed to fight again&s;t Anthony, their former general. A negotiation was therefore propo&s;ed, and, by the activity of Cocceius, a friend to both, a reconciliation was effected. All offences and affronts were mutually forgiven; and, to cement the union, a marriage was concluded between Anthony and Octavia, the &s;i&s;ter of Augu&s;tus. A new divi&s;ion of the Roman empire was made be|tween them; Augu&s;tus was to have the com|mand of the We&s;t; Anthony of the Ea&s;t; while Lepidus was obliged to content him&s;elf with the provinces in Africa. As for Sextus Pompeius, he was permitted to retain all the i&s;lands he had already po&s;&s;e&s;t, together with Pelopone&s;&s;us: he was al&s;o granted the privilege
<PB N="67" REF="73">
of demanding the con&s;ul&s;hip in his ab&s;ence, and of di&s;charging that office by any of his friends. It was likewi&s;e &s;tipulated to leave the &s;ea open, and pay the people what corn was due out of Sicily. Thus a general peace was concluded, to the great &s;atisfaction of the people, who now expected a ce&s;ation from all their calamities.</P>
<P>This calm &s;eemed to continue for &s;ome time; Anthony led his forces again&s;t the Parthians, over whom his lieutenant, Ventidius, had gained &s;ome advantages. Augu&s;tus drew the greate&s;t part of his army into Gaul, where there were &s;ome di&s;turbances; and Pompey went to &s;ecure his newly-ceded province to his intere&s;t. It was on this quarter that fre&s;h mo|tives were given for renewing the war. An|thony, who was obliged by treaty to quit Pelo|pone&s;&s;us, refu&s;ed to evacuate it till Pompey had &s;atisfied him for &s;uch debts as were due to him from the inhabitants. This, Pompey would by no means comply with, but imme|diately fitted out a new fleet, and renewed his former enterprizes, by cutting off &s;uch corn and provi&s;ions as were con&s;igned to Italy. Thus the grievances of the poor were again renewed; and the people began to complain, that in&s;tead of three tyrants they were now oppre&s;t by four.</P>
<P>In this exigence Augu&s;tus, who had long
<PB N="68" REF="74">
meditated the be&s;t means of dimini&s;hing the number, re&s;olved to begin by getting rid of Pompey, who kept the &s;tate in continual alarms. He was ma&s;ter of two fleets; one which he had cau&s;ed to be built at Ravenna, and another which Menodorus, who revolt|ed from Pompey, brought to his aid. His fir&s;t attempt was to invade Sicily; but being overpowered in his pa&s;&s;age by Pompey, and afterwards &s;hattered in a &s;torm, he was obliged to defer his de&s;igns to the en&s;uing year. Dur|ing this interval he was reinforced by a noble fleet of one hundred and twenty &s;hips, given him by Anthony, with which he re&s;olved once more to invade Sicily on three &s;everal quar|ters. But fortune &s;eemed &s;till determined to oppo&s;e him. He was a &s;econd time di&s;abled and &s;hattered by a &s;torm; which &s;o rai&s;ed the vanity of Pompey, that he began to &s;tyle him|&s;elf the &s;on of Neptune. However, Augu&s;tus was not to be intimidated by any di&s;graces; for, having &s;hortly refitted his navy, and recruited his forces, he gave the command of both to Agrippa, his faithful friend and a&s;&s;ociate in war. Agrippa proved him&s;elf worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; he began his operations by a victory over Pompey; and, though he was &s;hortly after wor&s;ted him&s;elf, he &s;oon after gave his adver&s;ary a complete and final overthrow. Thus undone, Pompey re&s;olved to fly to An|thony,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
from whom he expected refuge, as he had formerly obliged that Triumvir by giving pro|tection to his mother. However, a gleam of hope offering, he tried, once more, at the head of a &s;mall body of men, to make him&s;elf inde|pendent, and even &s;urprized Anthony's lieute|nants, who had been &s;ent to accept of his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions. Neverthele&s;s, he was at la&s;t aban|doned by his &s;oldiers, and delivered up to Titus, Anthony's lieutenant, who &s;hortly after cau&s;ed him to be &s;lain.</P>
<P>The death of this general removed one very powerful ob&s;tacle to the ambition of Augu&s;tus, and he re&s;olved to take the earlie&s;t opportunity to get rid of the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates. An offence was &s;oon furni&s;hed by Lepidus, that &s;erved as a &s;ufficient pretext for depriving him of his &s;hare in the Triumvirate. Being now at the head of twenty-two legions, with a &s;trong body of cavalry, he idly &s;uppo&s;ed that his pre|&s;ent power was more than an equivalent to the popularity of Augu&s;tus. He therefore re&s;olved upon adding Sicily, where he then was, to his province, pretending a right, as having fir&s;t in|vaded it. Augu&s;tus &s;ent to expo&s;tulate upon the&s;e proceedings; but Lepidus fiercely replied, <Q>"That he was determined to have his &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, and would no longer &s;ubmit to let one alone po&s;&s;e&s;s all the autho|rity."</Q> Augu&s;tus was previou&s;ly informed
<PB N="70" REF="76">
of the di&s;po&s;ition of Lepidus's &s;oldiers; for he had, by his &s;ecret intrigues and large&s;&s;es, entirely attached them to him&s;elf. Where|fore, without further delay he, with great boldne&s;s, went alone to the camp of Lepidus, and with no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than his private bounties, and the authority he had gained by his former victories, he re&s;olved to depo&s;e his rival. The &s;oldiers throng'd round him with the mo&s;t dutiful alacrity, while Lepidus ha&s;t|ened to prevent their defection. But Augu&s;tus&punc; though he received a wound from one of the centurions, flew, with great pre&s;ence of mind, to the place where the military en&s;igns were planted, and flouri&s;hing one of them in the air, all the legionary &s;oldiers ran in crowds and &s;a|luted him as their general. Lepidus being thus abandoned by his men, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of all the marks of his authority, which he could no longer keep, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively threw him|&s;elf at the feet of Augu&s;tus. This general de|&s;pi&s;ed his colleague too much to take his life; he &s;pared it, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the army, but deprived him of all his for|mer authority, and bani&s;hed him to Circaeum. There he continued the re&s;t of his life, de&s;pi&s;ed by his friends, and to all a melancholy object of bla&s;ted ambition.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus was received, upon his return to Rome, with univer&s;al joy; the &s;enators&punc; met
<PB N="71" REF="77">
him at the gates, and conducted him to the Capitol: the people followed crowned with garlands of flowers; and, after having re|turned thanks to the gods, waited upon him to his palace. There remained now but one ob&s;tacle to his ambition, which was Anthony, whom he re&s;olved to remove, and for that purpo&s;e began to render his character as con|temptible as he po&s;&s;ibly could at Rome. In fact, Anthony's conduct did not a little con|tribute to promote the endeavours of his am|bitious partner in the &s;tate. He had marched again&s;t the Parthians with a prodigious army, but was forced to return with the lo&s;s of the fourth part of his forces, and all his baggage. This extremely dimini&s;hed his reputation; but his making a triumphal entry into Alexandria, &s;oon after entirely di&s;gu&s;ted the citizens of Rome. However, Anthony &s;eemed quite regardle&s;s of their re&s;entment: alive only to plea&s;ure, and totally di&s;regarding the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, he &s;pent whole days and nights in the company of Cleopatra, who &s;tudied every art to encrea&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion, and vary his entertainments. Few women have been &s;o much celebrated for the art of giving no|velty to plea&s;ure, and making trifles impor|tant: &s;till ingenious in filling up the languid pau&s;es of &s;en&s;ual delight with &s;ome new &s;troke of refinement, &s;he was at one time a queen;
<PB N="72" REF="78">
then a Bachanal, and &s;ometimes an huntre&s;s. She invented a &s;ociety called, The Inimitable; and tho&s;e of the court who made the mo&s;t &s;umptuous entertainments, carried away the prize. Not contented with &s;haring, in her com|pany, all the delights which Egypt could af|ford, Anthony was re&s;olved to enlarge his &s;phere of luxury, by granting her many of tho&s;e king|doms which belonged to the Roman empire. He gave her all Phaenicia, Celo-Syria and Cyprus; with a great part of Cilicia, Arabia and Judea; gifts which he had no right to be|&s;tow, but which he pretended to grant in imi|tation of Hercules. This complication of vice and folly at la&s;t totally exa&s;perated the Ro|mans; and Augu&s;tus, willing to take the ad|vantage of their re&s;entment, took care to exag|gerate all his defects. At length, when he found the people &s;ufficiently irritated again&s;t him, he re&s;olved to &s;end Octavia, who was then at Rome, to Anthony, as if with a view of re|claiming her hu&s;band; but, in fact, to furni&s;h a &s;ufficient pretext of declaring war again&s;t him, as he knew &s;he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;t with contempt.</P>
<P>Anthony was now at the city of Leucopolis, revelling with his in&s;idious paramour, when he heard that Octavia was at Athens, upon her journey to vi&s;it him. This was very unwel|come news as well to him as to Cleopatra; who, fearing the charms of her rival, endea|voured
<PB N="73" REF="79">
to convince Anthony of the &s;trength of her pa&s;&s;ion by her &s;ighs, langui&s;hing looks, and well-feigned melancholy. He frequently caught her in tears, which &s;he &s;eemed as if willing to hide; and often entreated her to tell him the cau&s;e, which &s;he &s;eemed willing to &s;uppre&s;s. The&s;e artifices, together with the cea&s;ele&s;s flatte|ry, and importunity of her creatures, prevailed &s;o much upon Anthony's weakne&s;s, that he com|manded Octavia to return home without &s;eeing her, and attached him&s;elf &s;till more clo&s;ely to Cleopatra than before. His ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion now began to have no bounds. He re&s;olved to own her for his wife, and entirely to repudiate Octavia. He accordingly a&s;&s;embled the people of Alexandria in the public theatre, where was rai&s;ed an alcove of &s;ilver, under which were placed two thrones of gold, one for him&s;elf and the other for Cleopatra. There he &s;eated him&s;elf, dre&s;t like Bacchus, while Cleopatra &s;ate be&s;ide him cloathed in the ornaments and attributes of I&s;is, the principal deity of the Egyptians. On that occa&s;ion he declared her queen of all the countries which he had already be&s;towed upon her; while he a&s;&s;ociated Cae&s;ario, her &s;on by Cae&s;ar, as her partner in the govern|ment. To the two children which he had by her him&s;elf, he gave the title of king of kings, with very exten&s;ive dominions: and, to crown his ab&s;urdities, he next &s;ent a minute account of
<PB N="74" REF="80">
his proceedings to the two con&s;uls at Rome. One folly is generally the parent of many more. As he became a god, it was now ne|ce&s;&s;ary to act up to his imaginary dignity; new luxuries and pageantries were now there|fore &s;tudied, and new modes of profu&s;ion found out: no le&s;s than &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds of our money was lavi&s;hed upon one &s;ingle entertain|ment: it is &s;aid, upon this occa&s;ion, that Cleopatra di&s;&s;olved a pearl of great value in vinegar, and drank it off. Yet, however high wrought their entertainments might be, they wanted that delicacy which gives the fine&s;t reli&s;h to all &s;en&s;ual happine&s;s. Anthony, as we are told, was but a coar&s;e and inelegant &s;oldier, who mi&s;took ob&s;cenity for wit, and profu&s;ion for magnificence. Cleopatra, who was naturally more refined, was yet obliged to comply with his di&s;po&s;ition, and to bear with his debaucheries, rather than &s;hare them. But we are told of one circum&s;tance that might well repre&s;s their delights, and teach mankind to reli&s;h the beverage of virtue, however &s;im|ple, above their mo&s;t ze&s;ted enjoyments. He was &s;u&s;picious of being poi&s;oned in every meal; he feared Cleopatra, whom he &s;o much loved, and would eat nothing without having it pre|viou&s;ly ta&s;ted by one of his attendants.</P>
<P>In the mean time Augu&s;tus had now a &s;uffi|cient pretext for declaring war, and informed
<PB N="75" REF="81">
the &s;enate of his intentions. However, he de|ferred the execution of his de&s;ign for a while, being then employed in quelling an in&s;urrection of the Illyrians. The following year was chiefly taken up in preparations again&s;t Anthony, who, perceiving his de&s;ign, remon&s;trated to the &s;enate, that he had many cau&s;es of complaint again&s;t his colleague, who had &s;eized upon Sicily without affording him a &s;hare; alledg|ing that he had al&s;o dipo&s;&s;e&s;t Lepidus, and kept to him&s;elf the province he had command|ed; and that he had divided all Italy among his own &s;oldiers, leaving nothing to recom|pence tho&s;e in A&s;ia. To this complaint Au|gu&s;tus was contented to make a &s;arca&s;tic an&s;wer, implying, that it was ab&s;urd to complain of his di&s;tribution of a few trifling di&s;tricts in Italy; when, Anthony having conquered Par|thia, he might now reward his &s;oldiers with cities and provinces. The &s;arca&s;m upon An|thony's misfortunes in Parthia, &s;o provoked him, that he ordered Canidius, who command|ed his army, to march, without intermi&s;&s;ion, into Europe; while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos, in order to prepare for carrying on the war with vigour. When arrived there it was ridiculous enough to behold the odd mix|ture of preparations for plea&s;ure and for war. On one &s;ide all the kings and princes from Egypt to the Euxine &s;ea, had orders to &s;end
<PB N="76" REF="82">
him thither &s;upplies both of men, provi&s;ions and arms; on the other &s;ide, all the come|dians, dancers, buffoons, and mu&s;icians of Greece, were ordered to attend him. Thus, frequently, when a &s;hip was thought to arrive laden with &s;oldiers, arms and ammunition, it was found only filled with players and thea|trical machinery. When news was expected of the approach of an army, me&s;&s;engers only arrived with tidings of a fre&s;h quantity of veni&s;on. In this manner he laboured to unite incompatible pur&s;uits; the kings who attended him endeavoured to gain his favour more by their entertainments, than their warlike pre|parations: the provinces &s;trove rather to plea&s;e him by &s;acrificing to his divinity, than by their alacrity in his defence; &s;o that &s;ome were heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What rejoicings would not this man make for a victory, when he thus triumphs at the eve of a dangerous war!"</Q> In &s;hort, his be&s;t friends now began to for&s;ake his intere&s;ts, which is generally the ca&s;e with all tho&s;e who fir&s;t for&s;ake them&s;elves.</P>
<P>His delay at Samos, and afterwards at Athens, where he carried Cleopatra, to receive new ho|nours, was extremely favourable to the arms of Augu&s;tus. This general was, at fir&s;t, &s;carcely in a di&s;po&s;ition to oppo&s;e him, had he gone into Italy; but he &s;oon found time to put him&s;elf in a condition for carrying on the war; and,
<PB N="77" REF="83">
&s;hortly after, declared it again&s;t him in form. All Anthony's followers were invited over to join him, with great promi&s;es of rewards; but they were not declared enemies, partly to pre|vent their growing de&s;perate, and partly to give a &s;hew of moderation to his own party. At length, both found them&s;elves in readine&s;s to begin the war, and their armies were an&s;wer|able to the empire they contended for. The one was followed by all the forces of the Ea&s;t; the other drew all the &s;trength of the We&s;t to &s;upport his preten&s;ions. Anthony's force com|po&s;ed a body of an hundred thou&s;and foot, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e; while his fleet amount|ed to five hundred &s;hips of war. The army of Augu&s;tus mu&s;tered but eighty thou&s;and foot, but equalled his adver&s;ary's in his number of cavalry: his fleet was but half as numerous as Anthony's; however, his &s;hips were better built, and manned with better &s;oldiers. Such forces on both &s;ides may excite our wonder, but not our intere&s;t: neither had a good cau&s;e to &s;upport, the contention of both being only like that of two robbers who quarrel in the divi&s;ion of their plunder.</P>
<P>The great deci&s;ive engagement, which was a naval one, was fought near Actium, a city of Epirus, at the entrance of the gulph of Ambracia. Anthony ranged his &s;hips before the mouth of the gulph; and Augu&s;tus drew up his fleet in
<PB N="78" REF="84">
oppo&s;ition. Neither general a&s;&s;umed any fixt &s;tation to command in, but went about from &s;hip to &s;hip, wherever his pre&s;ence was ne|ce&s;&s;ary. In the mean time, the two land ar|mies, on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the gulph, were drawn up, only as &s;pectators of the engagement; and encouraged the fleets, by their &s;houts, to en|gage. The battle began, on both &s;ides, with great ardour; and after a manner not practi&s;ed upon former occa&s;ions. The prows of their ve&s;&s;els were armed with brazen points; and with the&s;e they drove furiou&s;ly again&s;t each other. In this conflict, the &s;hips of Anthony came with greater force, but tho&s;e of Augu&s;tus avoided the &s;hock with greater dexterity. On Anthony's &s;ide, the &s;terns of the &s;hips were rai&s;ed in form of a tower; from whence they threw arrows, from machines for that purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e of Augu&s;tus, made u&s;e of long poles, hooked with iron, and fire-pots. They fought in this manner for &s;ome time, with equal ani|mo&s;ity; nor was there any advantage on either &s;ide, except a &s;mall appearance of di&s;order in the centre of Anthony's fleet. But all of a &s;ud|den, Cleopatra determined the fortune of the day. She was &s;een flying from the engagement, attended by &s;ixty &s;ail; &s;truck, perhaps, with the terrors natural to her &s;ex: but what encrea&s;ed the general amazement, was, to behold An|thony him&s;elf following &s;oon after, and leaving
<PB N="79" REF="85">
his &s;leet at the mercy of the conquerors. The engagement, notwith&s;tanding, continued with great ob&s;tinacy till five in the evening; when Anthony's forces, partly con&s;trained by the conduct of Agrippa, and partly per&s;uaded by the promi&s;es of Augu&s;tus, &s;ubmitted to the conqueror. The land forces &s;oon after followed the example of the navy; and all yielded to Augu&s;tus without &s;triking a blow, the fourth day after the battle.</P>
<P>When Cleopatra fled, Anthony pur&s;ued her in a five-oar'd galley; and, coming along &s;ide of her &s;hip, entered it without &s;eeing, or being &s;een by her. She was in the &s;tern, and he went to the prow, where he remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent, holding his head between his hands. In this manner he continued three whole days, during which, either through indignation or &s;hame, he neither &s;aw nor &s;poke to Cleopatra. At la&s;t, when they were arrived at the promon|tory of Tenarus, the queen's female attendants reconciled them, and every thing went on as before. Still, however, he had the con&s;olation to &s;uppo&s;e his army continued faithful to him, and accordingly di&s;patched orders to his lieu|tenant Canidius, to conduct it into A&s;ia. How|ever, he was &s;oon undeceived when he arrived in Africa, where he was informed of their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his rival. This account &s;o tran&s;ported him with rage, that he was hardly prevented
<PB N="80" REF="86">
from killing him&s;elf; but at length, at the en|treaty of his friends, he returned to Alexandria, in a very different &s;ituation from that in which he had left it &s;ome time before. Cleopatra, however, &s;eemed to retain that fortitude in her misfortunes, which had utterly abandoned her admirer. Having ama&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable riches, by means of confi&s;cations, and other acts of violence, &s;he formed a very &s;ingular and un|heard of project: this was to convey her whole fleet over the i&s;tmus of Suez into the Red Sea, and thereby &s;ave her&s;elf in another region, be|yond the reach of Rome, with all her trea&s;ures. Some of her ve&s;&s;els were actually tran&s;ported thither, pur&s;uant to her orders; but the Ara|bians having burnt them, and Anthony di&s;&s;uad|ing her from the de&s;ign, &s;he abandoned it for the more improbable &s;cheme of defending Egypt again&s;t the conqueror. She omitted nothing in her power to put this advice in practice, and made all kinds of preparations for war; at lea&s;t hoping thereby to obtain better terms from Augu&s;tus. In fact, &s;he had always loved Anthony's fortunes rather than his per&s;on; and if &s;he could have fallen upon any method of &s;aving her&s;elf, though even at his expence, there is no doubt but &s;he would have embraced it with gladne&s;s. She even &s;till had &s;ome hopes from the power of her charms, though &s;he was arrived almo&s;t at the age of
<PB N="81" REF="87">
forty; and was de&s;irous of trying upon Augu&s;tus, tho&s;e arts which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with the greate&s;t men of Rome. Thus, in three em|ba&s;&s;ies, which were &s;ent one after another, from Anthony to Augu&s;tus in A&s;ia, the queen had always her &s;ecret agents, charged with parti|cular propo&s;als in her name. Anthony de&s;ired no more than that his life might be &s;pared, and to have the liberty of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of his days in ob&s;curity. To the&s;e propo&s;als Au|gu&s;tus made no reply. Cleopatra &s;ent him al&s;o public propo&s;als in favour of her children; but at the &s;ame time privately re&s;igned him her crown, with all the en&s;igns of royalty. To the queen's public propo&s;al, no an&s;wer was given: to her private offer he reply'd, by giving her a&s;&s;urances of his favour, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;ent away Anthony, or put him to death. The&s;e nego|tiations were not &s;o private but they came to the knowledge of Anthony, who&s;e jealou&s;y and rage every occurrence now contributed to heighten. He built a &s;mall &s;olitary hou&s;e upon a mole in the &s;ea, and there &s;hut him&s;elf up, a prey to all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that are the tormentors of un&s;ucce&s;sful tyranny. There he pa&s;t his time, &s;hunning all commerce with mankind, and profe&s;&s;ing to imitate Timon the man-hater. However, his furious jealou&s;y drove him even from this retreat into &s;ociety; for hearing that Cleopatra had many &s;ecret conferences with one
<PB N="82" REF="88">
Thyr&s;us, an emi&s;&s;ary from Augu&s;tus, he &s;eized upon him, and having ordered him to be cruelly &s;courged, he &s;ent him back to his patron. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent letters by him, importing that he had cha&s;tized Thyr&s;us for in&s;ulting a man in misfortunes; but withal he gave Augu&s;tus permi&s;&s;ion to avenge him&s;elf, by &s;courging Hiparchus, Anthony's freedman, in the &s;ame manner. The revenge, in this ca&s;e, would have been highly plea&s;ing to Anthony, as Hiparchus had left him, to join the fortunes of his more &s;ucce&s;sful rival.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the operations of the war were carried vigorou&s;ly forward, and Egypt was once more the theatre of the contending armies of Rome. Gallus, the lieutenant of Augu&s;tus, took Paretonium, which opened the whole country to his incur&s;ions. On the other &s;ide, Anthony, who had &s;till con&s;iderable forces by &s;ea and land, wanted to take that important place from the enemy. He therefore marched towards it, flattering him&s;elf, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf to the legions which he had once commanded, their affection for their an|tient general would revive. He approached therefore, and exhorted them to remember their former vows of fidelity. Gallus, however, ordered all the trumpets to &s;ound, in order to hinder Anthony from being heard, &s;o that he was obliged to retire.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">
Augu&s;tus him&s;elf was in the mean time ad|vancing with another army before Pelu&s;ium, which, by its &s;trong &s;ituation, might have re|tarded his progre&s;s for &s;ome time. But the go|vernor of the city, either wanting courage to de|fend it, or previou&s;ly in&s;tructed by Cleopatra to give it up, permitted him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; &s;o that Augu&s;tus had now no ob&s;tacle in his way to Alexandria, whither he marched with all expedition. Anthony, upon his arrival, &s;allied out to oppo&s;e him, fighting with great de&s;peration, and putting the enemy's cavalry to &s;light. This &s;light advantage once more re|vived his declining hopes; and, being naturally vain, he re-entered Alexandria in triumph. Then going, all armed as he was, to the palace, he embraced Cleopatra, and pre&s;ented her a &s;oldier who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the late en|gagement. The queen rewarded him very mag|nificently; pre&s;enting him with an head-piece and brea&s;t-plate of gold. With the&s;e, however, the &s;oldier went off the next night to the other army; prudently re&s;olving to &s;ecure his riches, by keeping on the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide. Anthony, however, could not bear this defection without fre&s;h indignation; he re&s;olved, therefore, to make a bold expiring effort by &s;ea and land, but pre|viou&s;ly offered to fight his adver&s;ary in &s;ingle combat. Augu&s;tus too well knew the inequality of their &s;ituations, to comply with this forelorn
<PB N="84" REF="90">
offer; he only, therefore, coolly reply'd, that Anthony had ways enough to die be&s;ides &s;ingle combat.</P>
<P>The evening before the day appointed for his la&s;t de&s;perate attempt, he ordered a grand entertainment to be prepared. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Give me good wine, and good cheer," cried he to his friends; "let me live to-day, to-morrow, perhaps, you may &s;erve another ma&s;ter."</Q> About mid|night, as Plutarch relates, while a melancholy &s;ilence reigned throughout the city, a noi&s;e of voices, in&s;truments, and dancing, was heard, as if pa&s;&s;ing through the town, and &s;eeming to go out at the gate which looked towards the enemy. At day-break, Anthony po&s;ted the few troops he had remaining, upon a ri&s;ing ground near the city; from whence he &s;ent orders to his gallies to engage the enemy. There he waited to be a &s;pectator of the com|bat; and, at fir&s;t, he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee them advance in good order; but his approba|tion was &s;oon turned into rage, when he &s;aw his &s;hips only &s;aluting tho&s;e of Augu&s;tus, and both fleets uniting together, and &s;ailing back into the harbour. At the very &s;ame time, his cavalry de&s;erted him. He tried, however, to lead on his infantry, which were ea&s;ily vanqui&s;hed; and he him&s;elf compelled to return into the town. His anger was now ungovernable; he could not help crying out aloud as he pa&s;t, that he
<PB N="85" REF="91">
was betrayed by Cleopatra, and delivered by her to tho&s;e, who, for her &s;ake alone, were his enemies. In the&s;e &s;u&s;picions he was not deceiv|ed, for it was by &s;ecret orders from the queen that the fleet had pa&s;t over to the enemy.</P>
<P>Cleopatra had, for a long while, dreaded the effects of Anthony's jealou&s;y; and had, &s;ome time before, prepared a method of obviating any &s;udden &s;allies it might produce. Near the temple of I&s;is &s;he had erected a building, which was &s;eemingly de&s;igned for a &s;epulchre. Hither &s;he removed all her trea&s;ure, and mo&s;t valuable effects, covering them over with torches, fag|gots, and other combu&s;tible matter. This &s;e|pulchre &s;he de&s;igned to an&s;wer a double pur|po&s;e; as well to &s;creen her from the &s;udden re|&s;entments of Anthony, as to make Augu&s;tus believe that &s;he would burn all her trea&s;ures, in ca&s;e he refu&s;ed her proper terms of capitulation. Here, therefore, &s;he retired from Anthony's pre&s;ent fury; &s;hutting the gates, which were fortified with bolts and bars of iron: but in the mean time, gave orders, that a report &s;hould be &s;pread of her death. This news, which &s;oon reached Anthony, recalled all his former love and tenderne&s;s. This poor wretch was now a being &s;ubject to the gu&s;t of every pa&s;&s;ion, and each of them in extreme. He now lamented her death with the &s;ame violence he had but a few minutes before &s;eemed to de&s;ire it.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="86" REF="92">"Wretched man," cried he to him&s;elf, "what is there now worth living for; &s;ince all that could &s;ooth or &s;often my cares is departed! O Cleopatra," continued he, being got to his chamber, "our &s;eparation does not &s;o much afflict me, as the di&s;grace I &s;uffer, in permit|ting a woman to in&s;truct me in the ways of dying."</Q> He then called one of his freedmen, named Eros, whom he had engaged by oath to kill him, whenever fortune &s;hould drive him to this la&s;t re&s;ource. Eros being now commanded to perform his promi&s;e, this faithful follower drew the &s;word, as if going to execute his or|ders, but turning his face, plunged it into his own bo&s;om, and died at his ma&s;ter's feet. Anthony, for a while hung over his faithful &s;ervant, and commending his fidelity, took up the &s;word, with which, &s;tabbing him&s;elf in the belly, he fell backward upon a little couch. Tho' the wound was mortal, yet the blood &s;topping, he recovered his &s;pirits, and earne&s;tly conjured tho&s;e who were come into the room to put an end to his life; but they all fled, being &s;eized with fright and horror. He therefore conti|nued in this manner for &s;ome time; &s;till cry|ing out and writhing with pain, till he was informed by one of the queen's &s;ecretaries that his mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;till alive. He then earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be carried to the place where &s;he was. They accordingly brought him to the gate of
<PB N="87" REF="93">
the &s;epulchre; but Cleopatra, who would not permit it to be opened, appeared at the win|dow, and threw down cords in order to pull him up. In this manner, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her two female attendants, &s;he rai&s;ed him all bloody from the ground; and while yet &s;u&s;pended in the air, he continued &s;tretching out his hands to encourage her. Cleopatra and her maids had only ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to rai&s;e him; and at la&s;t, with much &s;training, they effected their purpo&s;e, and carried him to a couch, on which they gently laid him. Here &s;he gave way to her &s;orrow, tearing her cloaths, beating her brea&s;t, and ki&s;&s;ing the wound of which he was dying. She called upon him as her lord, her hu&s;band, her emperor, and &s;eemed to have forgot her own di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the greatne&s;s of his &s;ufferings. Anthony entreated her to mo|derate the tran&s;ports of her grief, and a&s;ked for &s;ome wine, either becau&s;e he was thir&s;ty, or thought it would ha&s;ten his end: after he had drank he entreated Cleopatra to endea|vour to pre&s;erve her life, if &s;he could do it with honour; and recommended Proculus, a friend of Augu&s;tus, as one &s;he might rely on to be her interce&s;&s;or. He exhorted her not to lament for his misfortunes, but to congratulate him upon his former felicity, to con&s;ider him as one who had lived the mo&s;t powerful of men, and at la&s;t died by the hand of a
<PB N="88" REF="94">
Roman. Ju&s;t as he had done &s;peaking he expired, and Proculus made his appearance by command of Augu&s;tus, who had been in|formed of Anthony's de&s;perate conduct. He was &s;ent to try all means of getting Cleopatra into his power. Augu&s;tus having a double motive for his &s;ollicitude on this occa&s;ion: one, to prevent her de&s;troying the trea&s;ures &s;he had taken with her into the tomb; the other to pre&s;erve her per&s;on as an ornament to grace his triumph. Cleopatra, however, was upon her guard, and would not confer with Proculus, except through the gate, which was very well &s;ecured. In the mean time, while he de&s;ignedly drew out the conference to &s;ome length, and had given Galus, one of his fellow &s;oldiers, directions to carry on the conver&s;ation in his ab&s;ence, he entered with two more by the window at which Anthony had been drawn up. As &s;oon as he was entered he ran down to the gate; and one of the women crying out, that they were taken alive; Cleopatra, perceiving what happened, drew a poniard, and at|tempted to &s;tab her&s;elf; but Proculus prevent|ing the blow, gently remon&s;trated that &s;he was cruel in refu&s;ing &s;o good a prince as his ma&s;ter was, the plea&s;ure of di&s;playing his cle|mency. He then forced the poniard out of her hand, and examined her cloaths to be cer|tain &s;he had no poi&s;on about her. Thus leav|ing
<PB N="89" REF="95">
every thing &s;ecured, he went to acquaint his ma&s;ter with his proceedings.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus was extremely plea&s;ed at finding her in his power: he &s;ent Epaphroditus to bring her to his palace, and to watch her with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. He was likewi&s;e ordered to u&s;e her, in every re&s;pect, with that deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which was due to her rank; and to do every thing in his power to render her captivity agreeable. She was per|mitted to have the honour of granting Anthony the rites of burial, and furni&s;hed with every thing &s;he de&s;ired, that was becoming his dig|nity to receive, or her love to offer. Yet, &s;till &s;he langui&s;hed under her new confinement. Her exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow, her many lo&s;&s;es, and the blows &s;he had given her bo&s;om, produced a fever which &s;he &s;eemed willing to encrea&s;e. She re&s;olved to ab&s;tain from taking any nouri&s;h|ment, under the pretence of a regimen nece&s;&s;ary for her di&s;order; but, Augu&s;tus being made acquainted with the real motive, by her phy&s;i|cian, began to threaten her, with regard to her children, in ca&s;e &s;he per&s;i&s;ted. This was the only puni&s;hment that could now affect her; &s;he allowed her&s;elf to be treated as they thought proper, and received whatever was pre&s;cribed for her recovery.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Augu&s;tus made his entry into Alexandria; taking care to mitigate the
<PB N="90" REF="96">
fears of the inhabitants, by conver&s;ing famili|arly as he went along, with Areus, a philo&s;opher, and a native of the place. The citizens, however, trembled at his approach, and when he placed him&s;elf upon the tribunal, they pro&s;trated them&s;elves, with their faces to the ground, be|fore him, like criminals who waited the &s;en|tence of their execution. Augu&s;tus pre&s;ently ordered them to ri&s;e, telling them, that three motives induced him to pardon them. His re&s;pect for Alexander, who was the founder of their city; his admiration of its beauty; and his friend&s;hip for Areus, their fellow-citizen. Two only of particular note were put to death upon this occa&s;ion; Anthony's elde&s;t &s;on Antyl|lus, and Cae&s;ario, the &s;on of Julius Cae&s;ar, both betrayed into his hands by their re&s;pective tu|tors, who them&s;elves &s;uffered for their perfidy &s;hortly after. As for the re&s;t of Cleopatra's children, he treated them with great gentlene&s;s, leaving them to the care of tho&s;e who were in|tru&s;ted with their education, who had orders to provide them with every thing &s;uitable to their birth. When &s;he was recovered from her late indi&s;po&s;ition, he came to vi&s;it her in per&s;on; &s;he received him lying upon a couch, in a care|le&s;s manner; and upon his entering the appart|ment, ro&s;e up to pro&s;trate her&s;elf before him. She was dre&s;t in nothing but a loo&s;e robe; her misfortunes had given an air of &s;everity to her
<PB N="91" REF="97">
features; her hair was di&s;hevelled, her voice trembling, her complexion pale, and her eyes red with weeping. Yet, &s;till her natural beauty &s;eemed to gleam through the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that &s;ur|rounded her; and the graces of her motion, and the alluring &s;oftne&s;s of her looks, &s;till bore te&s;timony to the former power of her charms. Augu&s;tus rai&s;ed her with his u&s;ual complai|&s;ance, and de&s;iring her to &s;it, placed him&s;elf be&s;ide her. Cleopatra had been prepared for this interview, and made u&s;e of every method &s;he could think of, to propitiate the conqueror. She tried apologies, entreaties and allurements, to obtain his favour, and &s;often his re&s;ent|ment. She began by attempting to ju&s;tify her conduct; but when her art and &s;kill failed again&s;t manife&s;t proofs, &s;he turned her defence into &s;upplications. She talked of Cae&s;ar's hu|manity to tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he read &s;ome of his letters to her, full of tenderne&s;s, and enlarged upon the long intimacy that had pa&s;t between them. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But of what &s;ervice," cried &s;he, "are now all his benefits to me! Why could I not die with him! Yet he &s;till lives, methinks I &s;ee him &s;till before me, he revives in you."</Q> Augu&s;tus was no &s;tranger to this method of addre&s;s, but he remained firm again&s;t all attacks, an&s;wering always with a cold indifference, which obliged her to give her attempts a dif|ferent turn. She now addre&s;t his avarice, pre|&s;enting
<PB N="92" REF="98">
him with an inventory of her trea&s;ure and jewels. This gave occa&s;ion to a very &s;in|gular &s;cene, which &s;hews that the little deco|rums of breeding were then, by no means, &s;o carefully attended to as at pre&s;ent. One of her &s;tewards having alledged that the inventory was defective, and that &s;he had &s;ecreted a part of her effects, &s;he fell into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, &s;tarted from her couch, and catching him by the hair, gave him &s;everal blows on the face. Augu&s;tus &s;miled at her indignation, and lead|ing her to the couch, de&s;ired her to be paci|fied. To this &s;he replied, that &s;he could not bear being in&s;ulted in the pre&s;ence of one whom &s;he &s;o highly e&s;teemed. <Q>"And &s;uppo&s;ing," cried &s;he, "that I have &s;ecreted a few trifles, am I to blame, when they are re&s;erved not for my&s;elf, but for Livia and Octavia, whom I hope to make my interce&s;&s;ors with you?"</Q> This excu&s;e, which intimated a de&s;ire of liv|ing, was not di&s;agreeable to Augu&s;tus, who politely a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he was at liberty to keep whatever &s;he had re&s;erved, and that in every thing &s;he &s;hould be indulged to the height of her expectations. He then took leave, and departed; imagining he had recon|ciled her to life, and to the indignity of being &s;hewn in the intended triumph, which he was preparing for his return to Rome: but in this he was deceived. Cleopatra, all this time,
<PB N="93" REF="99">
had kept a corre&s;pondence with Dollabella, a young Roman of high birth, in the camp of Augu&s;tus; who, perhaps, from compa&s;&s;ion, or &s;tronger motives, was intere&s;ted in the misfor|tunes of that prince&s;s. From him &s;he learnt the intentions of Augu&s;tus, and that he was de|termined to &s;end her off in three days, together with her children, to Rome. She now, there|fore, determined upon dying; but previou&s;ly, entreated permi&s;&s;ion to pay her la&s;t oblations at Anthony's tomb. This reque&s;t being granted her, &s;he was carried with her two female atten|dants, to the &s;tately monument where he was laid. There &s;he threw her&s;elf upon his coffin, bewailed her captivity, and renewed her pro|te&s;tations not to &s;urvive him. She then crown|ed the tomb with garlands of flowers; and hav|ing ki&s;&s;ed the coffin a thou&s;and times, &s;he return|ed home, to execute her fatal re&s;olution. Hav|ing bathed, and ordered a &s;umptuous banquet, &s;he attired her&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. She then fea&s;ted as u&s;ual, and &s;oon after order|ed all but her two attendants, Charmion and Iras, to leave the room. Then, having pre|viou&s;ly ordered an a&s;p to be &s;ecretly conveyed to her in a ba&s;ket of fruit, &s;he &s;ent a letter to Augu&s;tus, informing him of her fatal purpo&s;e, and de&s;iring to be buried in the &s;ame tomb with Anthony. Augu&s;tus, upon receiving this letter, in&s;tantly di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to &s;top
<PB N="94" REF="100">
her intentions, but they arrived too late. Upon entering the chamber, they beheld Cleopatra lying dead upon a gilded couch, arrayed in her royal robes. Near her, Iras, one of her faith|ful attendants, was &s;tretched lifele&s;s at the feet of her mi&s;tre&s;s; and Charmion her&s;elf, almo&s;t expiring, was &s;ettling the diadem upon Cleo|patra's head.<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "Alas!" cried one of the me&s;|&s;engers, "was this well done, Charmion?" "Yes," replied &s;he, "it is well done; &s;uch a death becomes a glorious queen, de&s;cended from a race of noble ance&s;tors."</Q> On pro|nouncing the&s;e words, &s;he fell down, and died with her much lov'd mi&s;tre&s;s. There are &s;ome circum&s;tances in the death of this celebrated woman, that intere&s;ts our affections, contrary to the dictates of our rea&s;on. Though with &s;carce any valuable talent but that of cun|ning, and &s;carce any other ornament but that of beauty, yet we pity her fate, and &s;ympa|thize with her di&s;tre&s;&s;es. She died at the age of thirty-nine, after having reigned twenty-two years. Her death put an end to the mo|narchy in Egypt, which had flouri&s;hed there for immemorial ages.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus &s;eemed much troubled at Cleopa|tra's death, as it deprived him of a principal ornament in his intended triumph. However, the manner of it, a good deal exalted her cha|racter among the Romans, with whom &s;uicide
<PB N="95" REF="101">
was con&s;idered as a virtue. Her dying reque&s;t was complied with, her body being laid by Anthony's, and a magnificent funeral prepared for her and her two faithful attendants. By the death of Anthony, Augu&s;tus was now be|come complete ma&s;ter of the Roman Empire. He &s;oon after returned to Rome in triumph; where, by &s;umptuous fea&s;ts and magnificent &s;hews, he began to obliterate the impre&s;&s;ions of his former cruelty, and from thence for|ward, re&s;olved to &s;ecure by his clemency, a throne, the foundations of which were laid in blood. He was now at the head of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive empire that mankind had ever con|curred in obeying. The former &s;pirit of the Romans, and tho&s;e characteri&s;tic marks that di&s;tingui&s;hed them from others, was totally lo&s;t. The city was now inhabited by a con|cour&s;e from all the countries of the world, and being con&s;equently dive&s;ted of all ju&s;t patriotic principles, perhaps a monarchy was the be&s;t form of government that could be found to unite its members. However, it is very remarkable, that during the&s;e long contentions among them&s;elves, and the&s;e horrid deva&s;tations by civil-war, the &s;tate was daily growing more formidable and powerful, and completed the de&s;truction of all the kings who pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e it. A modern Politician <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quiou.</NOTE>, pretends to
<PB N="96" REF="102">
prove upon principle, that this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in every &s;tate long harra&s;&s;ed by civil-war. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on," &s;ays he, "the nobility, the citizens, the arti&s;ans, the pea&s;ants, in &s;hort, the whole body of the people become &s;oldiers; and when peace has united all the contending parties, this &s;tate enjoys great advantages over others, who&s;e &s;ubjects are generally citizens. Be&s;ides, civil-wars al|ways produce great men; as then is the &s;ea&s;on when merit is &s;ought for, and talents become con&s;picuous."</Q> However this may be, there never was a time when Rome was &s;o magnificent, &s;o populous and &s;o refined. The empire was now brought very near its utmo&s;t extent. It contained in Europe, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Greece, Illyrricum, Dacia, Pan|nonia, Britain, and &s;ome part of Germany. In A&s;ia, all tho&s;e provinces which went under the name of A&s;ia Minor, together with Armenia, Syria, Judaea, Me&s;opotamia and Media. In Africa, almo&s;t all tho&s;e parts of it which were then &s;uppo&s;ed habitable; namely, Egypt, Numidia, Mauritania and Lybia; the whole of their empire comprizing an extent of be|tween three and four thou&s;and miles in length, and half as much in breadth. As to the yearly revenues of the empire, they have been computed to about forty millions of our money. The number of the citizens amounted to four
<PB N="97" REF="103">
millions and &s;ixty-three thou&s;and men, women and children; a number, at lea&s;t, four times greater than that of London, at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t populous city in the world. As to the improvements in polite learning, they exceed|ed all that preceded them, and have never &s;ince been equalled. Be&s;ides Virgil, and Ho|race, and Ovid, poets, who&s;e names it is &s;uf|ficient to mention; Livy, the hi&s;torian, graced this period; a writer who&s;e works are as much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other hi&s;torian, as the actions he undertook to record were greater. Without either pedantry or affecta|tion, it may be &s;aid, that none have ever been comparable to him; and in whatever point of view his books may be con&s;idered, whether in point of accuracy, eloquence, or vigour of imagination, he has &s;et mankind a model of the grande&s;t &s;ubject, treated in the mo&s;t be|coming manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. From the death of Anthony to the death of Augu&s;tus.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="725" UNIT="U. C."> THE government having now taken a permanent form, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that hi&s;tory can teem with &s;uch &s;triking events, as during that period in which the con&s;titution was &s;truggling for freedom. But a dearth of hi&s;torical occurrences is generally the happi|ne&s;s of the people. In fact, Rome never en|joyed an interval of &s;o much pro&s;perity as dur|ing the continuance of the reign of Augu&s;tus. From the moment he wanted a rival he gave up his cruelty; and, being entirely without an oppo&s;er, he &s;eemed totally dive&s;ted of &s;u&s;pi|cion. His fir&s;t care was to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the friends of Anthony; to which end he pub|licly reported that he had burnt all Anthony's letters and papers without reading them, con|vinced that while any thought them&s;elves &s;u&s;|pected they would be fearful of even offering him their friend&s;hip. His next &s;troke of politics was to e&s;tabli&s;h order, or rather per|manent &s;ervitude; for, when once the &s;ove|reignty is u&s;urped in a free &s;tate, every tran&s;|action
<PB N="99" REF="105">
on which an unlimited authority can be founded is called a regulation: however as the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e that rai&s;e their for|tunes, a&s;&s;ume new titles to authorize their power, Augu&s;tus re&s;olved to conceal his new power under u&s;ual names and ordinary dignities. He cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be &s;tyled emperor, to pre&s;erve authority over the army; he made him&s;elf to be created tribune, to manage the people; and prince of the &s;enate, to govern there. Thus uniting in his own per&s;on &s;o many different powers, he charged him&s;elf al&s;o with the cares belonging to each &s;eparate department; and while he did the greate&s;t good to others, fully gratified his ambition in the di&s;charge of his duty. In this manner the people's intere&s;ts and his ambition &s;eemed to co-operate, and while he governed all, he let them imagine that they were governing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, as he had gained the king|dom by his army, he re&s;olved to govern it by the &s;enate. This body, tho' greatly fallen from their ancient &s;plendour, he knew to be the be&s;t ordered, and mo&s;t capable of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice. To the&s;e therefore he gave the chief power in the admini&s;tration of his go|vernment, while he &s;till kept the people and the army &s;tedfa&s;t to him by donatives, and acts of favour. By the&s;e means all the odium of ju&s;tice fell upon the &s;enate, and all the po|pulariy
<PB N="100" REF="106">
of pardon was &s;olely his own. Thus re&s;toring to the &s;enate their ancient &s;plendour, and di&s;countenancing all corruption, he pre|tended to re&s;erve to him&s;elf a very moderate &s;hare of authority, which none could refu&s;e him: namely, an ab&s;olute power to compel all ranks of the &s;tate to do their duty. This, in fact, was re&s;erving ab&s;olute dominion in his own hands; but, the mi&s;guided people began to look upon his moderation with a&s;toni&s;h|ment: they con&s;idered them&s;elves as re&s;tored to their former freedom, except in the capacity of promoting &s;edition; and the &s;enate &s;uppo&s;ed their power re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all things but their tendency to inju&s;tice. It was even &s;aid that the Romans, by &s;uch a government, lo&s;t nothing of the happine&s;s that liberty could produce; and were exempt from all the mi&s;|fortunes it could occa&s;ion. This ob&s;ervation might have &s;ome truth under &s;uch a monarch as Augu&s;tus now appeared to be; but they were taught to change their &s;entiments under his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, when they found them&s;elves afflicted with all the puni&s;hments that tyranny could inflict or &s;edition make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>After having e&s;tabli&s;hed this admirable or|der, Augu&s;tus found him&s;elf agitated by dif|ferent inclinations; and con&s;idered a long time whether he &s;hould keep the empire or re&s;tore the people to their ancient liberty.
<PB N="101" REF="107">
The examples of Sylla and Cae&s;ar variou&s;ly operated upon him. He con&s;idered that Sylla, who had voluntarily quitted the dictator&s;hip, died peaceably in the mid&s;t of his enemies; and Cae&s;ar, who had kept it, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his mo&s;t intimate friends, who gloried in the action. Struggling with this trouble&s;ome un|certainty, he di&s;covered the di&s;order of his mind to his two principal friends Agrippa and Maecenas. Agrippa, who had gained him the empire by his valour, advi&s;ed him to re&s;ign it; either impelled by patrioti&s;m, or a de&s;ire to &s;eize upon what &s;hould be thus laid down. Maecenas, however, was of a contrary opinion. This mini&s;ter, &s;o famous for patronizing the men of genius of his time, had much merit, but was effeminate and tender. More an ad|mirer of the u&s;eful than the &s;plendid virtues, he was better &s;atisfied with what benefited the people than rai&s;ed their admiration: be&s;ides, he might have been influenced by &s;elf-inte|re&s;ted motives in the advice he gave; for being more capable of advi&s;ing than of acting, and entirely formed for the cabinet, he hoped to obtain tho&s;e honours from a ma&s;ter which he could not force from the people, with whom he mu&s;t have rai&s;ed him&s;elf by his own proper powers, and acted with vigorous independance. He therefore entreated Augu&s;tus to con&s;ider rather what was advantageous to his country
<PB N="102" REF="108">
than alluring to him&s;elf; he likened the re|public to a &s;hip fraught with pa&s;&s;engers, but totally de&s;titute of a pilot: he con&s;idered it as now grown almo&s;t a wreck, though &s;afely brought into harbour, and in the utmo&s;t danger of &s;ink|ing, if once more pu&s;ht off from &s;hore. He de&s;cribed the empire as now too great and un|wieldy to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the mo&s;t vigorous ma&s;ter, and likely to fall into pieces under a variety of rulers. To the&s;e he added a di&s;&s;ua&s;ive, perhaps &s;till more prevailing; namely, the &s;afety of the emperor, which no|thing but his pre&s;ent authority could &s;ecure. Tho&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed upon a mind already too well inclined to pre&s;erve that power which it had &s;o hardly laboured to obtain. From that time Augu&s;tus adopted the advice of Maecenas, not only in this in&s;tance, but on every other occa&s;ion. By the in&s;tructions of that great mini&s;ter, he became gentle, affable, and hu|mane. By his advice it was that he &s;et a re|&s;olution of never being concerned at what was &s;aid again&s;t him. However, in order to avoid obloquy as much as po&s;&s;ible, he encouraged men of learning, and gave them much of his time and his friend&s;hip. They in their turn relieved his mo&s;t anxious hours, and circulated his prai&s;e through the empire.</P>
<P>Thus having given peace and happine&s;s to the empire, and being convinced of the attach|ment
<PB N="103" REF="109">
of all the orders of the &s;tate to his per|&s;on, he re&s;olved upon impre&s;&s;ing the people with an idea of his magnanimity al&s;o. This was nothing le&s;s than making a &s;hew of re|&s;igning his authority; wherefore, having pre|viou&s;ly in&s;tructed his creatures in the &s;enate how to act, he addre&s;&s;ed them in a &s;tudied &s;peech, importing the difficulty of governing &s;o exten&s;ive an empire; a ta&s;k, which, he &s;aid, none but the immortal Gods were equal to. He mode&s;tly urged his own inability, though impelled by every motive to undertake it; and then, with a degree of &s;eeming genero&s;ity, freely gave up all that power, which, as he ob&s;erved, his arms had gained, and the &s;enate had confirmed. This power he repeatedly of|fered to re&s;tore, giving them to under&s;tand that the true &s;pirit of the Romans was not lo&s;t in him. This &s;peech operated upon the &s;enate variou&s;ly, as they were more or le&s;s in the &s;e|cret; many believed the &s;incerity of his pro|fe&s;&s;ions, and therefore regarded his conduct as an act of unequalled heroi&s;m by any thing that had hitherto appeared in Rome; others, equally ignorant of his motives, di&s;tru&s;ted his de&s;igns. Some there were who, having greatly &s;uffered during the late popular commotions, were fearful of having them renewed; but the ma|jority, who were entirely devoted to his inte|re&s;ts, and in&s;tructed by his mini&s;ters, fre|quently
<PB N="104" REF="110">
attempted to interrupt him while &s;peak|ing, and received his propo&s;al with pretended indignation. The&s;e unanimou&s;ly be&s;ought him not to re&s;ign the admini&s;tration; but upon his continuing to decline their reque&s;t, they in a manner compelled him to comply. However, that his per&s;on might be in greater &s;ecurity, they immediately decreed the pay of his guard to be doubled. On the other hand, that he might &s;eem to make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions on his &s;ide, he permitted the &s;enate to govern the weak internal provinces of the empire, while the mo&s;t powerful provinces, and tho&s;e that required the greate&s;t armies for their defence, were taken entirely under his own command. Over the&s;e he a&s;&s;umed the government but for ten years, leaving the people &s;till in hopes of regaining their ancient freedom; but, at the &s;ame time, laying his mea&s;ures were &s;o well, that his government was renewed every ten years to his death.</P>
<P>This &s;hew of a re&s;ignation only &s;erved to confirm him in the empire and the hearts of the people. New honours were heaped upon him. He was then fir&s;t called Augu&s;tus; a name I have hitherto u&s;ed as that by which he is be&s;t known in hi&s;tory. A laurel was ordered to be planted at his gates. His hou&s;e was called the palace, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that of ordinary citizens. He was confirmed in the
<PB N="105" REF="111">
title of father of his country, and his per&s;on declared &s;acred and inviolable. In &s;hort, flattery &s;eemed on the rack to find out new modes of plea&s;ing him; but, though he de&s;pi&s;ed the arts of the &s;enate, he permitted their homage, well knowing that among mankind, titles pro|duce a re&s;pect which enforces authority.</P>
<P>Upon entring into his tenth con&s;ul&s;hip, the &s;enate, by oath, approved of all their acts, and &s;et him wholly above the power of the laws. They &s;ome time after offered to &s;wear to not only all the laws he had made, but &s;uch as he &s;hould make for the future. It was then cu&s;tomary with fathers upon their death-beds, to command their children to carry oblations to the Capitol with this in&s;cription, That at the day of their deaths they left Augu&s;tus in health. It was determined that no man &s;hould be put to death on &s;uch days as the emperor entered the city. Upon a dearth of provi&s;ions, the people in a body entreated him to accept of the dictator&s;hip; but, though he undertook to be procurator of the provi&s;ions, yet, he would by no means accept of the title of dic|tator, which had been aboli&s;hed by a law made when Anthony was con&s;ul.</P>
<P>This accumulation of titles and employments however, did not, in the lea&s;t, dimini&s;h his a&s;|&s;iduity in filling the duties of each. Several very whole&s;ome edicts were pa&s;t by his com|mand,
<PB N="106" REF="112">
tending to &s;uppre&s;s corruption in the &s;enate, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the people. He ordained that none &s;hould exhibit a &s;how of gladiators without orders from the &s;enate, and then no oftener than twice a year, nor with more than a hundred and twenty at a time. This law was extremely nece&s;&s;ary at &s;o corrupt a period of the empire; when whole armies of the&s;e unfortunate men were brought at once upon the &s;tage, and compelled to fight often till half of them were &s;lain. It had been u&s;ual al&s;o with the knights, and &s;ome women of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, to exhibit them&s;elves as dancers upon the theatre; he ordered that not only they, but their children and grand-children, &s;hould be re&s;trained from &s;uch exerci&s;es for the future. He fined many that had refu&s;ed to marry at a certain age, and rewarded &s;uch as had many children. He ordained that virgins &s;hould not be married till twelve years of age; and permitted any per&s;on to kill an adulterer taken in the fact. He enacted that the &s;enate &s;hould be always held with great reverence, adding to its authority what he had taken from its power. He made a law, that no man &s;hould have the freedom of the city without a previous examination into his merit and cha|racter. He appointed new rules and limits to the manumi&s;&s;ion of &s;laves, and was him&s;elf very &s;trict in the ob&s;ervance of them. With regard
<PB N="107" REF="113">
to players, of whom he was very fond, he &s;e|verely examined their morals, not allowing the lea&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s in their lives, nor indecency in their actions. Though he encouraged the athletic exerci&s;es, yet he would not permit wo|men to be pre&s;ent at them; holding it unbe|coming the mode&s;ty of the &s;ex, to be &s;pecta|tors of the&s;e &s;ports, which were performed by naked men. In order to prevent bribery in &s;uing for offices, he took con&s;iderable &s;ums of money from the candidates, by way of pledge; and if any indirect practices were proved again&s;t them, they were obliged to forfeit all. Slaves had been hitherto di&s;allowed to confe&s;s any thing again&s;t their own ma&s;ters; but he abo|li&s;hed the practice, and fir&s;t &s;old the &s;lave to another; which altering the property, his examination became free. The&s;e, and many other laws, all tending to reform vice, or deter from crimes, gave the manners of the people another complexion; &s;o that the rough cha|racter of the Roman was now &s;oftened into that of the refined citizen.</P>
<P>Indeed his own example a good deal tended to humanize his fellow citizens; for being placed above all equality, he had nothing to fear from conde&s;cen&s;ion: wherefore he was fa|miliar with all, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be re|primanded with the mo&s;t patient humility. Though he was, by the &s;ingle authority of his
<PB N="108" REF="114">
&s;tation, capable of condemning, or acquitting whom&s;oever he thought proper; yet he gave the laws their proper cour&s;e, and even &s;ometimes pleaded for tho&s;e he de&s;ired to protect. Thus Primus, the governor of Macedonia, having a day a&s;&s;igned him for making war upon the Odri&s;ii, a neighbouring &s;tate, as he &s;aid, by the command of Augu&s;tus, the latter denied the charge. Upon which the advocate for Primus de&s;ired to know, with an in&s;olent air, What brought Augu&s;tus into court, or who had &s;ent for him? To this the emperor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively replied, "The commonwealth;" an an&s;wer which greatly plea&s;ed the people. Upon ano|ther occa&s;ion, one of his veteran &s;oldiers en|treated his protection in a certain cau&s;e; but Augu&s;tus taking little notice of his reque&s;t, de&s;ired him to apply to an advocate. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah," replied the &s;oldier, "it was not by proxy I &s;erved you at the battle of Actium."</Q> This reply plea&s;ed Augu&s;tus &s;o much, that he pleaded his cau&s;e in per&s;on, and gained it for him. He was extremely affable, and returned the &s;alutations of the meane&s;t per&s;ons. One day a per&s;on pre&s;ented him a petition, but with &s;o much awe, that Augu&s;tus was di&s;plea&s;ed with his meanne&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, friend," cried he, "you &s;eem as if you were offering &s;omething to an elephant, and not to a man; be bolder."</Q> One day, as he was &s;itting on the tribunal,
<PB N="109" REF="115">
in judgment, Maecenas perceiving by his tem|per, that he was inclined to be &s;evere, at|tempted to &s;peak to him; but not being able to get up to the tribunal for the crowd, he threw a paper into his lap, on which was wrote, "Ari&s;e, executioner." Augu&s;tus read it, without any di&s;plea&s;ure, and immediately ri&s;ing, pardoned tho&s;e whom he was di&s;po&s;ed to con|demn. But what mo&s;t of all &s;hewed a total alteration in his di&s;po&s;ition, was his treatment of Cornelius Cinna, Pompey's grand&s;on. This nobleman had entered into a very dangerous con&s;piracy again&s;t him, but the plot was di&s;|covered before it was ripe for execution. Au|gu&s;tus, for &s;ome time, debated with him&s;elf how to act; but, at la&s;t, his clemency pre|vailed; he therefore &s;ent for tho&s;e who were guilty, and after reprimanding them, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them all. But he was re&s;olved to mortify Cinna by the greatne&s;s of his genero&s;ity: for ad|dre&s;&s;ing him in particular, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have twice," &s;ays he, "given you your life; fir&s;t, as an enemy; now, as a con&s;pirator; I now give you the con&s;ul&s;hip: let us, therefore, be friends for the future; and let us only contend in &s;hew|ing, whether my confidence, or your fidelity, &s;hall be victorious."</Q> This genero&s;ity, which the emperor very happily timed, had &s;o good an effect, that, from that in&s;tant, all con&s;piracies cea&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="116">
In the practice of &s;uch virtues as the&s;e, he pa&s;&s;ed a long reign of above forty years, in which the happine&s;s of the people &s;eemed to con&s;pire with his own: not but that there were wars, in the di&s;tant provinces of the empire, during, almo&s;t, the whole reign; however, they were rather the quelling of in&s;urrections, than the extending of dominions; for he had made it a rule to carry on no operations, in which ambition, and not the &s;afety of the &s;tate, was concerned. In fact, he &s;eemed the fir&s;t Roman, who aimed at gaining a character by the arts of peace alone; and who obtained the affections of the &s;oldiers, without any military talents of his own. Neverthele&s;s, the Roman arms, under his lieutenants, were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The Cantabrians, in Spain, who had revolted, were more than once quelled by Ti|berius, his &s;tep-&s;on; Agrippa, his &s;on-in-law&punc; and Aelius Lama; who followed them to their inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, there blocked them up, and compelled them by famine to &s;urren|der at di&s;cretion. The Germans al&s;o gave &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, by their repeated incur&s;ions into the territories of Gaul, but were repre&s;&s;ed by Lollius. The Rhetians were conquered by Dru&s;us, the brother of Tiberius. The Be&s;&s;i and Sialatae, barbarous nations, making an ir|ruption into Thrace, were overthrown by Pi&s;o, governor of Pamphylia, who gained triumphal
<PB N="111" REF="117">
honours. The Dacians were repre&s;&s;ed with more than one defeat: the Armenians al&s;o were brought into due &s;ubjection by Caius, his grand&s;on. The Getulians, in Africa, took up arms; but were &s;ubdued by the con&s;ul, Caius Co&s;&s;us, who thence received the &s;urname of Getulicus. A dangerous war al&s;o was carried on again&s;t the Dalmatians and Pannonians, who having acquired great &s;trength, by the continuance of a long peace, gathered an army of two hundred thou&s;and foot, and nine thou|&s;and hor&s;e, threatening Rome it&s;elf with de|&s;truction. Levies were therefore made in Italy with the utmo&s;t expedition; the veteran troops were recalled from all parts, and Augu&s;tus went to Arminium, for the greater conveni|ence of giving his directions. And indeed, though per&s;onal valour was by no means his mo&s;t &s;hining ornament, yet no man could give wi&s;er orders upon every emergency, or go with greater di&s;patch into all parts of his do|minions than he. This war continued near three years, being principally managed by Tiberius and Germanicus, the latter of which gained great reputation again&s;t the&s;e fierce and barbarous multitudes. Upon their reduction, Bato, their leader, being &s;ummoned before the tribunal of Tiberius, and being demanded how he could offer to revolt again&s;t the power of Rome: the bold barbarian replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That
<PB N="112" REF="118">
the Romans, and not he, were the aggre&s;|&s;ors, &s;ince they had &s;ent, in&s;tead of dogs and &s;hepherds, to &s;ecure their flocks, only <MILESTONE N="752" UNIT="U. C."> wolves and bears to devour them."</Q> But the war which was mo&s;t fatal to the Roman inte|re&s;ts, during this reign, was that which was managed by Quintillius Varus. This general, invading the territories of the Germans, was induced to follow the enemy among their fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes, with his army in &s;eparate bodies: there he was attacked by night, and entirely cut off, with his whole army. The&s;e were the be&s;t and choice&s;t legions of the whole empire, either for valour, di&s;cipline or experience. The affliction, from this defeat, &s;eemed to &s;ink very deep upon the mind of Augu&s;tus. He was often heard to cry out, in a tone of an|gui&s;h, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quintillius Varus re&s;tore me my le|gions;"</Q> and &s;ome hi&s;torians pretend to &s;ay, that he never after recovered the former &s;ere|nity of his temper.</P>
<P>But he had &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of a dome&s;tic nature, in his own family, that contributed to di&s;tre&s;s him: he had married Livia, the wife of Tiberius Nero, by the con&s;ent of her hu&s;|band, at a time &s;he was &s;ix months gone with child. This was an imperious woman, and, con&s;cious of being beloved, &s;he controlled him ever after at her plea&s;ure. She had two &s;ons by her former hu&s;band; Tiberius, the elder,
<PB N="113" REF="119">
whom &s;he greatly loved; and Dru&s;us, who was born three months after &s;he had been mar|ried to Augu&s;tus, and who was thought to be his own &s;on. The elde&s;t of the&s;e, Tiberius, whom he afterwards adopted, and who &s;uc|ceeded him in the empire, was a good general, but of a &s;u&s;picious and ob&s;tinate temper; &s;o that though he was &s;erviceable to Augu&s;tus in his foreign wars, yet he gave him but little quiet at home. He was, at la&s;t, obliged to go into exile for five years to the i&s;land of Rhodes, where he chiefly &s;pent his time in a retired man|ner, conver&s;ing with the Greeks, and addict|ing him&s;elf to literature; of which, however, he made afterwards but a bad u&s;e. Dru&s;us, the other &s;on of Livia, died in his return from an expedition again&s;t the Germans, leaving Au|gu&s;tus incon&s;olable for his lo&s;s. But his greate&s;t affliction was, the conduct of his daughter Julia, whom he had by Scribonia, his former wife. This woman, whom he married to his general Agrippa, and after his death to Tibe|rius, &s;et no bounds to her lewdne&s;s. Not contented with enjoying her plea&s;ures, &s;he &s;eemed al&s;o earne&s;t in procuring the infamy of her pro&s;titutions. Augu&s;tus, for a long time, would not believe the accounts he daily heard of her conduct; but, at la&s;t, could not help ob&s;erving them. He found &s;he was arrived at that exce&s;s of wantonne&s;s and prodigality, that
<PB N="114" REF="120">
&s;he had her nocturnal appointments in the mo&s;t public parts of the city; the very court, were her father pre&s;ided, not being exempt from her debaucheries. He, at fir&s;t, had thoughts of putting her to death; but, after &s;ome con&s;i|deration, he bani&s;hed her to Pandataria, for|bidding her the u&s;e of wine, and all &s;uch de|licacies, as could inflame her vicious incli|nations: he ordered al&s;o, that no per&s;ons &s;hould come near her, without his own permi&s;&s;ion; and &s;ent her mother Scribonia with her, to bear her company. Afterwards, whenever any at|tempted to intercede for Julia, his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That fire and water &s;hould &s;ooner unite, than he with her."</Q> When &s;ome per&s;ons, one day, were more than u&s;ually urgent with him in her favour, he was driven to &s;uch an extremity of pa&s;&s;ion, as to wi&s;h, that they might have &s;uch a daughter. However, &s;he had two &s;ons by Agrippa, named Caius and Lucius, from whom great expectations were formed; but they died when &s;carcely arrived at man's e&s;tate; Lucius about five years after his father, at Mar&s;eilles; and Caius, two years after, on his return to Rome, of a wound he had received in Arme|nia. Thus Augu&s;tus having, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;urvived all his ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;t relations, at length, in the &s;eventy-fourth year of his age, began to think of retiring, in good earne&s;t, from the fatigues of &s;tate; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of con&s;tituting
<PB N="115" REF="121">
Tiberius &s;ucce&s;&s;or in his u&s;ual employments. He de&s;ired the &s;enate to &s;alute him no longer at the palace according to their cu&s;tom; nor to take it ami&s;s, if, for the future, he could not conver&s;e with them as formerly. From this <MILESTONE N="766" UNIT="U. C."> time, Tiberius was joined in the government of the provinces with him, and inve&s;t|ed with almo&s;t the &s;ame authority. How|ever, Augu&s;tus could not entirely for&s;ake the admini&s;tration of the &s;tate, which habit had mixed with his &s;atisfactions; he &s;till continued a watchful guardian of its intere&s;ts, and &s;hewed him&s;elf to the la&s;t, a lover of his people. Find|ing it now, therefore, very inconvenient to come to the &s;enate, by rea&s;on of his age, he de&s;ired to have twenty privy-coun&s;ellors a&s;&s;ign|ed him for a year; and it was decreed, that whatever mea&s;ures were re&s;olved upon by them, together with the con&s;uls, &s;hould have entirely the force of a law. He &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, apprehen&s;ive of his approaching end, for he made his will, and delivered it to the ve&s;tal virgins. He then &s;olemnized the cen&s;us, or numbering the people, whom he found to amount to four millions, one hundred and thirty-&s;even thou&s;and; which &s;hews Rome to be equal to four of the greate&s;t cities of modern times. While the&s;e ceremonies were per|forming, by a mighty concour&s;e of people

in the Campus Martius, it is &s;aid, that an eagle flew round the emperor &s;everal times, and di|recting its flight to a neighbouring temple, perched over the name of Agrippa; which was by the augurs conceived to portend the death of the emperor. Shortly after, having ac|companied Tiberius in his march into Illyria, as far as Beneventum, he was taken ill at that town of a diarrhoea. Returning, therefore, from thence, he came to Nola, near Capua, and there finding him&s;elf dangerou&s;ly ill, he &s;ent for Ti|berius, with the re&s;t of his mo&s;t intimate friends and acquaintance. He did not continue long to indulge vain hopes of a recovery, but, convinced that his end was at hand, patiently awaited its arrival. A few hours before his death, he ordered a looking-gla&s;s to be brought, and his hair to be adju&s;ted with more than u&s;ual care. He then addre&s;&s;ed his friends, whom he beheld &s;urrounding his bed, and de&s;ired to know, whether he had properly played his part in life: to which being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he cried out, with his la&s;t breath, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then give me your applau&s;e;"</Q> and thus, in the &s;eventy-&s;ixth year of his age, after reigning forty-one, he expired in the arms of Livia, bidding her remember their marriage and farewell.</P>

Roman empire; &s;ome thought that his wife Livia had &s;ome hand in ha&s;tening it, willing to procure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion more &s;peedily for her &s;on. However this be, &s;he took care, for &s;ome time, to keep it concealed, having guarded all the pa&s;&s;ages to the palace; &s;ometimes giving out that he was recovered, and then pretend|ing a relap&s;e. At length, having &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to her mind, &s;he publi&s;hed the em|peror's death, and at the &s;ame time the adop|tion of Tiberius to the empire. The emperor's funeral was performed with great magnificence. The &s;enators being in their places, Tiberius, on whom the care was devolved, began a con|&s;olatory oration to them; but &s;uddenly &s;topped in the beginning of his &s;peech, as unable to re|&s;train the violence of his &s;orrow; and, in&s;tead of continuing, gave his notes to Dru&s;us, his &s;on, who read them to the &s;enate. After this, one of the late emperor's freed men, publicly read his will in the &s;enate-hou&s;e, wherein he made Tiberius and Livia his heirs; and by that, Livia was likewi&s;e adopted into the Ju|lian family, and honoured with the name of Augu&s;ta. He gave con&s;iderable legacies to many private per&s;ons, to the Pretorian guards, to the legionary &s;oldiers, and to all the citizens of Rome. But his re&s;entment to his daugh|ter Julia, continued even to the la&s;t; he left
<PB N="118" REF="124">
her a &s;mall legacy indeed, but would neither re&s;tore her to her family, nor permit her to be buried in the &s;epulchre of her ance&s;tors. Be|&s;ides his will, four other writings of his were produced. One, in which he had left in&s;truc|tions concerning his funeral; another, contained an enumeration of his &s;everal exploits; a third, compri&s;ed an account of the provinces, forces, and revenues of the empire; and the fourth, was a &s;chedule of directions to Tiberius for governing the empire. Among the&s;e, it was found to be his opinion, that no man, how great a favourite &s;oever he might be, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with too much authority, le&s;t it &s;hould induce him to turn tyrant. Another maxim was, that none &s;hould de&s;ire to enlarge the empire, which was already pre&s;erved with difficulty. Thus he &s;eemed &s;tudious of &s;erving his country to the very la&s;t, and the &s;orrow of the people &s;eemed equal to his a&s;&s;iduity. It was decreed, that all the women &s;hould mourn for him a whole year. Temples were erected to him; divine honours were allowed him; and one Numerius Atticus, a &s;enator, willing to convert the adulation of the times to his own benefit, received a large &s;um of money, for &s;wearing that he &s;aw him a&s;cend|ing into heaven; &s;o that no doubt remained among the people concerning his divinity.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">
Such were the honours paid to Augu&s;tus, who&s;e power began in the &s;laughter, and ter|minated in the happine&s;s, of his &s;ubjects; &s;o that it was &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it had been good for mankind if he had never been born, or if he never had died."</Q> It is very proba|ble, that the cruelties exerci&s;ed in his trium|virate, were &s;ugge&s;ted by his colleagues; or, per|haps, he thought, in the ca&s;e of Cae&s;ar's death, that revenge was virtue. Certain it is, that the&s;e &s;everities were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;|&s;ary to re&s;tore public tranquility; for until the Roman &s;pirit was entirely eradicated, no mo|narchy could be &s;ecure. He gave the govern|ment an air &s;uited to the di&s;po&s;ition of the times; he indulged his &s;ubjects in the pride of &s;eeing the appearance of a republic, while he made them really happy in the effects of a mo&s;t ab&s;olute monarchy, guided by the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate prudence. In this la&s;t virtue he &s;eems to have excelled mo&s;t monarchs; and, indeed, could we &s;eparate Octavius from Augu&s;tus, he would be one of the mo&s;t faultle&s;s princes in hi&s;tory. The long peace which his &s;ubjects enjoyed, during his admini&s;tration, may be en|tirely a&s;cribed to his moderation alone; and about the middle of his reign, the greate&s;t part of mankind &s;aw them&s;elves, at once, profe&s;&s;ing obedience to one monarch, and in perfect har|mony

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Tiberius, the Third EMPEROR. <MILESTONE N="767" UNIT="U. C."></HEAD>
<P>TIBERIUS is, perhaps, the &s;tronge&s;t <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="A.D."> example of a man, by an exce&s;s of refinement, de&s;troying tho&s;e very advantages he attempts to &s;ecure. Augu&s;tus left him, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great popularity, and an happy empire: he immediately, however, found means to in|&s;ure his popularity, by claiming as a debt, that homage, which his predece&s;&s;or was will|ing to receive as a favour; and &s;ubverted the happine&s;s of the empire, by making a di&s;tinction between the welfare of the prince and the peo|ple. Thus all his abilities only &s;erved to heigh|ten his errors, and corrupt his heart; till, in the end, his life &s;eemed painfully employed, in finding pretexts for appearing what he might ea&s;ily have been; and in deceiving others, by being deceived him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of his &s;u&s;picion, when he came to the empire, was Agrippa Po&s;thumus, the third and only remaining &s;on of the gene|ral of that name, by Julia, daughter of Au|gu&s;tus.
<PB N="122" REF="128">
This youth having rather imitated the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his mother, than the prudence of his father, was bani&s;hed by Augu&s;tus into the i&s;land of Plana&s;ium; and was now mur|dered by the order of Tiberius, who pretended that it was done by the particular appointment of the late emperor, who was &s;olicitous for the &s;afety of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He even carried his di&s;&s;imulation &s;o far, that when the centurion, who had executed his commands, came with the account, Tiberius pretended, that he had given no &s;uch command, and that he &s;hould an&s;wer for his conduct before the &s;enate. How|ever, the bu&s;ine&s;s was hu&s;hed up &s;oon after, and no enquiry made after the murderer.</P>
<P>As for the people in general, they were now ready to &s;uffer every injury, without murmur|ing. Every order of the &s;tate was ambitious of &s;lavery, and only de&s;irous of &s;hewing the ex|tent of their obedience, by the humility of their adulation. All &s;uits and petitions were now made to Tiberius; and he, at the &s;ame time, took care, that nothing material &s;hould be done without his concurrence. The &s;enate was willing enough to give up the reins of go|vernment; yet he had &s;o much di&s;&s;imulation in his nature, as to wi&s;h to make his acceptance of them the greate&s;t favour. He began, therefore, in the &s;enate, with great art, to de&s;cant on the extent of the Roman empire,
<PB N="123" REF="129">
and the difficulty of guiding it with proper &s;kill; he then alledged his own in&s;ufficiency for the ta&s;k, and hinted that no man could be a worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Augu&s;tus. However, as the city was &s;o happily ornamented with great numbers of wi&s;e and worthy men, it would be more advi&s;able for a number to unite their care and their councils, than to lay the whole bur|then upon him alone. The &s;enate, however, &s;killed now only in the arts of adulation, be|&s;ought him, in the mo&s;t humble manner, to ac|cept of the government; and not reject a ta&s;k, to which he alone was equal. Tiberius upon this, pretending to be &s;omewhat &s;oftened, partly accepted their offers; but alledged, that he was unable to take the charge of the whole; how|ever, at their reque&s;t, he declared him&s;elf will|ing to undertake the protection of any one part they a&s;&s;igned him. Whereupon A&s;inius Gallus demanded, what part he was willing to take charge of. This unexpected que&s;tion quite confounded the di&s;&s;embling emperor. He, for &s;ome time, remained &s;ilent; but recovering him&s;elf, an&s;wered, with a &s;ubtle re&s;erve, that it ill became him to chu&s;e any one part of that, from which he begged a general exemption. Gallus, who now perceived he had gone too far, and who, perhaps, only put the que&s;tion to flatter his vanity, very readily brought him|&s;elf off, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he did not offer
<PB N="124" REF="130">
that que&s;tion, as though he de&s;igned to di|vide what was in it&s;elf indi&s;&s;oluble; but from his own confe&s;&s;ion, to convince him, that the commonwealth was but one body, and was con&s;equently to be actuated only by one &s;oul."</Q> At length Tiberius, &s;eemingly overcome by the importunities and clamours of all around him, yielded, by degrees, to their entreaties; and at la&s;t conde&s;cended to take upon him, the labour of the government purely to &s;atisfy their wi&s;hes, rather than his own; adding, however, that he would keep it only till they &s;hould think fit to give repo&s;e to his old age.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="765" UNIT="U. C."> He was now fifty-&s;ix years old, when he took <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="A.D."> upon him the government of the Roman empire. He had long lived in a profound &s;tate of di&s;&s;imu|lation under Augu&s;tus, and was not yet hardy enough to &s;hew him&s;elf in his real character. In the beginning of his reign nothing appeared but prudence, genero&s;ity and clemency. He utterly rejected many of tho&s;e great names and titles of honour which were &s;o liberally offered him by the &s;enate. He prohibited their erect|ing &s;tatues to him but upon certain occa&s;ions, and ab&s;olutely forbade their wor&s;hipping him as a deity. Tho&s;e ju&s;t prai&s;es al&s;o, which he might have received without cen&s;ure, &s;eemed irk&s;ome to him; and he appeared to de&s;ire no other rewards for his labours in the empire, but
<PB N="125" REF="131">
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having de&s;erved them. When the &s;enate offered to &s;wear to obey all the ordi|nances which had not only been made, but tho&s;e he was about to enact hereafter, he checked their vile adulation; ob&s;erving, that all &s;ub|lunary things were mutable and uncertain, and the higher he was rai&s;ed, his &s;tate would only be the more expo&s;ed to danger. He di&s;&s;embled al&s;o, great patience and moderation upon all occa&s;ions; and, though in the &s;enate there pa&s;t &s;ome things contrary to his will, yet, he &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t offended. Having learnt that &s;ome per&s;ons had &s;poken ill both of him and his government, he &s;hewed no re&s;ent|ment; but mildly replied, That in a free city the tongues of men ought al&s;o to be free. When the &s;enate would have proceeded again&s;t &s;ome who had libelled him, he would not con|&s;ent; alledging, That he had greater and more u&s;eful employments, than to embarra&s;s him&s;elf with &s;uch trifling concerns; adding, That the be&s;t way of puni&s;hing &s;uch as defamed him, was to make the account of his conduct un|ea&s;y to them, and by retaliating their con|tempt. When &s;ome governors had &s;hewn him a method of encrea&s;ing his revenues, he with indignation an&s;wered, That a good &s;hepherd ought to &s;hear but never flea his flock. He made many &s;umptuary edicts again&s;t taverns, and places of public re&s;ort; he puni&s;hed di&s;|hone&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="132">
matrons, and even prohibited ki&s;&s;ing by way of &s;alutation. He was very vigilant in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing robberies and &s;editions, and cau&s;ed ju&s;tice to be duly and regularly admini&s;tered in all the towns of Italy. He al&s;o behaved in a very re&s;pectful manner to the &s;enate, and in the beginning did nothing of moment without their advice and approbation. They, on their parts, continually forced upon him the mo&s;t extravagant prai&s;es; &s;o that no prince was ever more flattered than he. Nor is it an impro|bable conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e that this adulation &s;erved greatly to pejorate his mind, and to make him more boldly throw a&s;ide the ma&s;k of di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Germanicus fir&s;t brought his natural di&s;po&s;itions to light, and di&s;|covered the malignity of his mind without di&s;gui&s;e. He was &s;carce well &s;ettled on his throne when he received intelligence that the legions in Pannonia, hearing of the death of Augu&s;tus, and de&s;irous of novelty, had re|volted; but the&s;e were &s;oon quieted, and Percennius their leader &s;lain; but a commo|tion in Germany was attended with much more important con&s;equences. The legions in that part of the empire were conducted by Ger|manicus, the &s;on of Dru&s;us, late brother of Ti|berius, a youth of mo&s;t admirable qualities, and who had been, at the late emperor's reque&s;t,
<PB N="127" REF="133">
adopted to &s;ucceed to the empire. The legions under his command had taken the opportunity of his ab&s;ence to revolt, and now boldly began to affirm that the whole Roman empire was in their power, and that its principal grandeur was owing to the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms; where|fore, when Germanicus was returned, they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to chu&s;e him emperor. This general was the darling of the &s;oldiers, and almo&s;t idolized by them, &s;o that he might with very little difficulty have rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the highe&s;t dignity in the &s;tate; but his duty prevailed over his ambition; he rejected their offers with the utmo&s;t indignation, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t indefatigable endeavours to oppo&s;e the &s;edition. This he effected, though with extreme hazard, by cutting off many of the principal revolters, and then by leading the troops again&s;t the Germans, who were con|&s;idered as the common enemies of the empire.</P>
<P>Tiberius was as much plea&s;ed with the loy|alty of Germanicus as he was di&s;tre&s;t at his &s;uperior popularity; his &s;ucce&s;s al&s;o, imme|diately after, again&s;t the Germans, only &s;till more excited the emperor's envy and private di&s;gu&s;t: he overthrew the enemy in &s;everal battles, &s;ubduing many wild and exten&s;ive countries, the Angrivarii, the Cheru&s;ci, and the Chatti, with other fierce nations beyond the Rhine. Among his other conque&s;ts it
<PB N="128" REF="134">
was not con&s;idered as the lea&s;t honourable, that of recovering the &s;tandards that had been taken from the unfortunate Varus, and erecting trophies to the memory of his own legions, in tho&s;e very wilds in which the legions of the former were &s;lain. Upon one of the monu|ments of his victories he placed a mode&s;t in|&s;cription, mentioning only the people that were conquered, and the army which made the conque&s;t, entirely omitting his own name, either willing to avoid envy, or &s;en&s;ible that po&s;terity would &s;upply the defect.</P>
<P>All the&s;e victories, however, only &s;erved to enflame the emperor's jealou&s;y, and every vir|tue in the general now became a new cau&s;e of offence. This di&s;like fir&s;t began to appear by Tiberius making u&s;e of every pretence to draw Germanicus from the legions; but he was for a while obliged to po&s;tpone his purpo&s;e, upon account of a dome&s;tic in&s;urrection, which was made in Italy by one Clemens, who had been a &s;lave to the young Agrippa that was &s;lain. This adventurer being about the &s;ame age, and in per&s;on very much re&s;embling his late ma&s;|ter, took upon him his name, and cau&s;ed it to be reported in all parts of Italy that <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="A.D."> Agrippa was &s;till alive. This report, idle as it was, had a &s;urprizing influence through the empire, and rai&s;ed great tumults in many towns of Italy, Clemens him&s;elf boldly a&s;&s;erting his
<PB N="129" REF="135">
claim, and now and then appearing in diffe|rent parts of the country, when he could do it with &s;afety. Tiberius, however, knew but too well the impo&s;ture, and was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e fraud on his &s;ide to that of this young pre|tender. Accordingly, two &s;oldiers were em|ployed, who were to find him out, and, by pretending an attachment to his per&s;on, &s;eize him upon the fir&s;t opportunity. This com|mi&s;&s;ion they executed with punctuality and &s;ucce&s;s. Clemens was taken pri&s;oner, and brought before Tiberius, who &s;ternly de|manded how he came to be Agrippa? to which the other as boldly replied, "By the &s;ame arts with which you have become Cae&s;ar." Ti|berius finding by his re&s;olution that it was vain to expect any di&s;covery from him of his accomplices, re&s;olved to put him immediately to death; however, &s;uch were his apprehen|&s;ions from the people, that he would not pu|ni&s;h him publicly, but ordered him to be con|veyed to a &s;ecret apartment in the palace, and there to be executed in private.</P>
<P>Being now rid of his dome&s;tic enemy, he began to con&s;ult on the mo&s;t &s;pecious means of bringing home Germanicus from the legions in Germany. For this, an inva&s;ion of the Parthians offered him the faire&s;t opportunity. The&s;e fierce and unconquerable people having &s;lain two of their own kings, and having re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="130" REF="136">
to accept one who had been an ho&s;tage at Rome, and was, it &s;eems, the lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or, they broke the peace, which had been ratified in the reign of Augu&s;tus, and in|vaded Armenia, a kingdom tributary to the empire. Tiberius was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this inva&s;ion, as it gave him a pretext for re|calling Germanicus from tho&s;e legions, which were too much devoted to his intere&s;t. He fir&s;t, therefore, began by procuring him a triumph for his victory in Germany, and then by writing to him to return, in order to enjoy the&s;e honours which the &s;enate had decreed: add|ing, that he had reaped enough of glory in a country where he had been &s;ent nine times, and had been every time victorious; concluding that the number of triumphs was &s;ufficient; and, that the mo&s;t &s;ignal vengeance that could be in|flicted on them, was their being permitted to carry on their own inte&s;tine commotions. To all the&s;e &s;pecious civilities Germanicus made no direct reply, but earne&s;tly entreated the continuance of his command for one year lon|ger, only to fini&s;h the enterprizes he had be|gun. Tiberius, however, was too well &s;killed in di&s;&s;imulation not to prevail upon him by a repetition of pretended honours; he offered him the con&s;ul&s;hip, and de&s;ired him to execute the office in per&s;on; &s;o that Germanicus had no longer any pretences for refu&s;ing. Thus,
<PB N="131" REF="137">
finding the &s;ea&s;on very far advanced, he delayed his return no longer; and he was met many miles out of the city by infinite multitudes, who received him rather with marks of adora|tion than re&s;pect: the gracefulne&s;s of his per&s;on; his triumphal chariot, in which were carried his five children; and the recovered &s;tandards of the army of Varus, threw the people into a phrenzy of joy and admiration. Tiberius, though inwardly repining, &s;eemed to join in the general rapture: he gave the people, in the name of Germanicus, three hundred &s;e&s;terces each man, and the &s;ucceeding year made him his colleague in the con&s;ul&s;hip. However, his aim was to &s;end him to a di&s;tance from Rome, where his popularity was now become odious to him; and yet, not to give him &s;uch command as could at any time be turned again&s;t him&s;elf. Wherefore, the Parthian in|va&s;ion was now very convenient for his de&s;igns; and, be&s;ides, there now offered other pretexts for &s;ending him into A&s;ia, which might be con&s;idered as no better than &s;pecious bani&s;h|ment. Antiochus, king of Comagena, and Phi|lopater, king of Cicilia, being both dead, &s;ome differences aro&s;e in tho&s;e nations to the preju|dice of the Romans. At the &s;ame time al&s;o, Syria and Judaea, overburthened with taxes, made earne&s;t &s;upplications for redre&s;s. The&s;e, therefore, appeared to be objects worthy the
<PB N="132" REF="138">
attention of Germanicus, and Tiberius was not wanting in urging before the &s;enate the nece&s;&s;ity there was of his pre&s;ence in that quarter of the empire. In con&s;equence of this, all the provinces of A&s;ia were readily decreed to Germanicus, and a greater power given him than had been granted to any governor be|fore. But Tiberius, to re&s;train this power, had &s;ent Cneius Pi&s;o governor into Syria; hav|ing di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t Silenus of that office. This Pi&s;o was a per&s;on of a furious and head&s;trong tem|per, and in every re&s;pect fit to execute tho&s;e fatal purpo&s;es for which he was de&s;igned. His in&s;tructions were to oppo&s;e Germanicus upon every occa&s;ion, and to excite all the ha|tred again&s;t him which, without &s;u&s;picion, he could; and even to procure his death, if an opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="A.D."> Germanicus being now appointed to his new dignity, departed from Rome for his ea&s;tern expedition, carrying with him his wife Agrippina and his children. In the mean time, Pi&s;o, pur|&s;uant to his directions, endeavoured to gain the affections of the &s;oldiers by all the arts of bribery and adulation. He took every oppor|tunity of abu&s;ing Germanicus, and taxed him with dimini&s;hing the Roman glory, by his pe|culiar protection to that people who called them|&s;elves Athenians, but were now &s;uch no longer: Germanicus di&s;regarded his invectives, being
<PB N="133" REF="139">
more employed in executing the bu&s;ine&s;s of his commi&s;&s;ion than in counteracting the private de|&s;igns of Pi&s;o. In a &s;hort time he replaced the king of Armenia, who was a friend to the Ro|mans, and reduced Cilicia and Comagena into Roman provinces, placing praetors there to collect the taxes due to the empire. He &s;oon after obliged the king of Parthia to &s;ue for peace, which was granted him much to the advantage and honour of Rome. However, Pi&s;o, and his wife Plancina, who is recorded as one of an implacable and cruel di&s;po&s;ition, continued to defame him, and openly to tax all his proceedings. The&s;e efforts of ineffective malice were quite di&s;regarded; Germanicus only oppo&s;ed patience and conde&s;cen&s;ion to all their invectives; and, with that gentlene&s;s which was peculiar to him, repaid their re&s;ent|ment by courte&s;y. He was not ignorant of their motives, and was rather willing to evade than oppo&s;e their enmity. Wherefore he took a voyage into Egypt, under a pretence of view|ing the celebrated antiquities of the place; but in reality to avoid the machinations of Pi&s;o and tho&s;e of his wife, which were &s;till more dangerous. However, upon his return he fell &s;ick; and, whether from a mind previou&s;ly alarmed, or from more apparent marks of treachery, he &s;ent to let Pi&s;o know, that he broke off all fur|ther connexions and friend&s;hip with him. A
<PB N="134" REF="140">
&s;hort interval of convale&s;cence re&s;tored the hopes of his friends, and the citizens of An|tioch prepared to offer &s;acrifices for his reco|very. However, Pi&s;o, with his lictors, di|&s;turbed their &s;olemnities, and drove off their victims from the foot of the altars. In the mean time, Germanicus grew daily wor&s;e, and his death now began to appear inevitable. Whereupon, finding his end approaching, he addre&s;t his friends who &s;tood round his bed, to the following effect. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Had my death been natural, I might have rea&s;on to complain of being thus &s;natched away from all the endear|ments of life, at &s;o early an age; but now my complaints are aggravated in falling the victim of Pi&s;o and Plancina's treachery. Let the emperor, therefore, I conjure you, know the manner of my death, and the tor|tures I &s;uffer. Tho&s;e that loved me, when living, tho&s;e even that envied my fortune, will feel &s;ome regret, when they hear of a &s;oldier who had &s;o often e&s;caped the rage of the enemy, falling a &s;acrifice to the trea|chery of a woman. Plead then my cau&s;e before the people; you will be heard with pity; and if my murderers &s;hould pretend to have acted by command, they will either receive no credit or no pardon."</Q> As he &s;poke the&s;e words, he &s;tretched forth his hand, which his weeping friends tenderly pre&s;&s;ing, mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly

vowed, that they would &s;ooner lo&s;e their lives than their revenge. The dying prince then turning to his wife, conjured her by his memory, and all the bonds of nuptial love, to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and to evade the re&s;entment of her more powerful enemies, by not oppo&s;ing it. Thus much he &s;aid openly, &s;omething more was uttered in private, intimating, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, his fears from the empetor's cruelty, and &s;hortly after he expired. Nothing could exceed the di&s;tre&s;s of the whole empire, upon hearing of the death of Germanicus. But the people of Rome &s;eemed to put no bounds to their di&s;tre&s;s. A vacation was made in all public and dome&s;|tic duties; the &s;treets were filled with lamen|tations; the people ca&s;t &s;tones at their tem|ples, and flung down their altars; while new|born infants were expo&s;ed, as objects not worthy parental attention in this univer&s;al di|&s;tre&s;s. So much was the &s;pirit of the people now changed from its former fortitude and equality. They now were &s;o accu&s;tomed to place their happine&s;s in paying homage to their ma&s;ters, that they con&s;idered the &s;afety of the &s;tate as compri&s;ed in an individual. In fact, the community was now compo&s;ed of per|&s;ons who had lately received their freedom, or of &s;uch indolent and idle people as lived at the expence of the public trea&s;ure. The&s;e
<PB N="136" REF="142">
were therefore &s;en&s;ible of nothing but their own imbecillity; and afflicted them&s;elves, like children, for evils which were only &s;ugge&s;ted by their fears.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s, Pi&s;o &s;eemed marked for de&s;truction. Hi&s;torians in general, charge him and his wife with the death of Germa|nicus; it is now too remote a period to con|trovert their te&s;timony; however, the general accu&s;ation of their giving him a &s;low poi&s;on, is one of tho&s;e imputations that &s;eems to have but little foundation. The belief of &s;low poi|&s;ons is now much di&s;puted, it being in general &s;uppo&s;ed by phy&s;icians that it is not in the power of art to regulate the duration of their effect. Let this be as it will, not only Pi&s;o and his wife, but even the emperor him&s;elf, with his mother Livia, incurred a &s;hare of the general &s;u&s;picions. The&s;e were &s;oon after greatly encrea&s;ed by the arrival of Agrippina, the widow of Germanicus, a woman in high e&s;teem for her virtue, who appeared bearing the a&s;hes of her hu&s;band, and attended by all her chil|dren. As &s;he approached the city, &s;he was met by the &s;enate, and the whole body of the people of Rome, with a &s;trange mixture of acclamation and di&s;tre&s;s. The veteran &s;oldiers, many of whom had &s;erved under Germanicus, gave the &s;in|cere&s;t te&s;timonies of their concern. The whole multitude, while the a&s;hes were depo&s;iting in
<PB N="137" REF="143">
the tomb of Augu&s;tus, at fir&s;t regarded the ce|remony in profound &s;ilence; but &s;hortly after, all of a &s;udden, broke out into loud lamen|tations; crying, that the commonwealth was now no more.</P>
<P>Tiberius, who&s;e jealou&s;y had &s;ome rea&s;on to be alarmed at this effeminate exce&s;s of &s;orrow, u&s;ed all his art to hide his anger, and make a &s;hew of &s;haring in the general calamity. He even permitted the accu&s;ation of Pi&s;o, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be merely the in&s;trument of his ven|geance. This general having returned to Rome &s;hortly after, pre&s;uming on the great favour he was in with the emperor, was accu&s;ed before the &s;enate, in behalf of Agrippina and her friends, of the death of Germanicus; and &s;everal other crimes, particularly his cruelty to good men, and his corrupting the legions, were laid to his charge.</P>
<P>Pi&s;o, either con&s;cious of his innocence, or &s;eeing the inefficacy of any defence again&s;t the tide of popularity, vindicated him&s;elf but weakly again&s;t every part of the charge. However, the poi|&s;oning of Germanicus could not be made ap|pear evident enough to &s;atisfy his judges, who &s;eemed to take part again&s;t him. His trial was therefore drawn out to a greater length than was expected; but in the mean time, he cut it &s;hort, by putting an end to his life in his own hou&s;e. His wife Plancina, who was uni|ver&s;ally believed to be mo&s;t culpable, e&s;caped
<PB N="138" REF="144">
puni&s;hment by the intere&s;t of Livia; &s;o that all di&s;turbances rai&s;ed upon this account, by de|grees &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>About a year after the death of Germanicus, Tiberius took his own &s;on Dru&s;us, as a col|league with him in the con&s;ul&s;hip; and willing to initiate him into bu&s;ine&s;s betimes, left him in the government of the city, while he him&s;elf retired, under the pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition. About this time, &s;everal nations of the Gauls revolted, being unable to endure the heavy tributes which the emperor had lately impo&s;ed upon them. The principal leaders in this re|volt were Florus and Sacrovir, who were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the beginning, that the fame of their &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;pread con&s;ternation even as far as Rome. Caius Silius, however, marched with the Roman legions to oppo&s;e them, and gained a great and deci&s;ive victory. A revolt al&s;o happened about this time in Numidia, un|der Tacfarinas, who had rebelled once before; but he was now in &s;ome mea&s;ure brought under by Blae&s;us, who, in con&s;equence, had received the honour of being &s;aluted imperator, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Tiberius.</P>
<P>Hitherto Tiberius had kept within bounds; he was frugal, ju&s;t in the di&s;tribution of offices, a rigid puni&s;her of inju&s;tice in others, and an example of temperance to his luxurious court. But now, from the ninth year of his reign, it
<PB N="139" REF="145">
is that hi&s;torians begin to trace the bloody ef|fects of his &s;u&s;picious temper.</P>
<P>Having now no object of jealou&s;y to keep him in awe, he began to pull off the ma&s;k, and appear more in his natural character than be|fore. He no longer adopted that wi&s;e&s;t maxim, the truth of which has familiarized it into a proverb, that hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy; with him, judgement, ju&s;tice, and extent of think|ing, were converted into &s;lyne&s;s, artifice, and expedients adapted to momentary conjunctures. He took upon him&s;elf the interpretation of all political mea&s;ures, and gave morals whatever colour he cho&s;e, by the fine-drawn &s;peculations of his own malicious mind. He began daily to dimini&s;h the authority of the &s;enate; which de&s;ign was much facilitated, by their own apti|tude to &s;lavery; &s;o that he de&s;pi&s;ed their meanne&s;s, while he enjoyed its effects. A law at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, which made it trea&s;on to form any injurious attempt again&s;t the maje&s;ty of the people. Tiberius a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the interpretation and enforcement of this law, and extended it not only to the ca&s;es which really affected the &s;afety of the &s;tate, but to every conjuncture that could po&s;&s;ibly be fa|vourable to his hatred or &s;u&s;picions. All freedom was now therefore bani&s;hed from con|vivial meetings, and diffidence reigned among&s;t the deare&s;t relations. The gloomy di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="140" REF="146">
and in&s;incerity of the prince, were diffu&s;ed through all ranks of men; friend&s;hip had the air of an allurement to betray; and a fine ge|nius was but a &s;hining indi&s;cretion; even virtue it&s;elf was only con&s;idered as an impertinent intruder, that only &s;erved to remind the people of their lo&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The law of offended maje&s;ty being revived, the fir&s;t of note that fell a &s;acrifice to it was Cremutius Cordus, who, in his annals of the Roman empire, had called Brutus the la&s;t of the Romans. It is al&s;o thought he had given offence to Sejanus, the emperor's favourite, by too great liberty in private conver&s;ation. This brave man &s;eeing his death re&s;olved upon, de|fended him&s;elf in the &s;enate with great force and undaunted re&s;olution. Then going home, he re&s;olved to defeat the malice of the tyrant, by a voluntary death, and refu&s;ed taking any manner of &s;u&s;tenance. The informers, who perceived that he was upon the point of de|priving them of their reward, pre&s;ented their complaints to the &s;enate, &s;ignifying his inten|tentions of e&s;caping ju&s;tice. However, while their petitions continued under deliberation, Cremutius, as Seneca expre&s;&s;es it, pronounced his own ab&s;olution by dying.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the&s;e cruelties, Tiberius took into his confidence Sejanus, a Roman knight, who found out the method of gaining
<PB N="141" REF="147">
his confidence, by the mo&s;t refined degree of di&s;&s;i|mulation, being an over match for his ma&s;ter in his own arts. This favourite mini&s;ter, by birth a Vol&s;cian, was clo&s;e and &s;ubtle in his de&s;igns, but bold and a&s;piring in his attempts; mode&s;t to outward appearance, but concealing an am|bition that knew no bounds. He was &s;o &s;ecure in the affections of the emperor, that, tho' ever re&s;erved and &s;ecret to others; he was entirely open and explicit with him. He was made by the emperor captain of the Praetorian guards, one of the mo&s;t confidential tru&s;ts in the &s;tate, and extolled in the &s;enate as a worthy a&s;&s;ociate in his labours. The &s;ervile &s;enators, with ready adulation, &s;et up the &s;tatues of the favourite be&s;ide tho&s;e of Tiberius, and &s;eemed eager to pay him &s;imilar honours. It is not well known whether he was the advi&s;er of all the cruelties that en&s;ued &s;oon after, but certain it is, that, from the beginning of his mini&s;try, Tiberius &s;eemed to become more fatally &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>It was from &s;uch humble beginnings, that this mini&s;ter even ventured to a&s;pire at the throne, and was re&s;olved to make the empe|ror's fooli&s;h confidence one of the fir&s;t &s;teps to his ruin. However, he con&s;idered that cut|ting off Tiberius alone, would rather retard than promote his de&s;igns, while his &s;on Dru&s;us and the children of Germanicus were yet re|maining. He therefore began by corrupting
<PB N="142" REF="148">
Livia, the wife of Dru&s;us, whom, after having debauched, he prevailed upon to poi&s;on her hu&s;band. This was effected by means of a &s;low poi&s;on, (as we are told) which gave his death the appearance of a ca&s;ual di&s;temper. Tiberius, in the mean time, either naturally phlegmetic, or, at be&s;t, not much regarding his &s;on, bore his death with great tranquility. He was even heard to je&s;t upon the occa&s;ion; for when the emba&s;&s;adors from Troy came &s;ome|what late with their compliments of condo|lence, he an&s;wered their pretended di&s;tre&s;&s;es, by condoling with them al&s;o upon the lo&s;s of Hector.</P>
<P>Sejanus having &s;ucceeded in this, was re|&s;olved to make his next attempt upon the children of Germanicus, who were undoubted &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the empire. However, he was fru&s;trated in his de&s;igns, both with regard to the fidelity of their governors, and the cha&s;tity of Agrippina, their mother. Whereupon he re&s;olved upon changing his aims, and removing Tiberius out of the city; by which means he expected more frequent opportunities of put|ting his de&s;igns into execution. He therefore u&s;ed all his addre&s;s to per&s;uade Tiberius to retire to &s;ome agreeable retreat, remote from Rome. By this he expected many advantages, &s;ince there could be no acce&s;s to the emperor but by him. Thus all letters being conveyed to
<PB N="143" REF="149">
the prince by &s;oldiers at his own devotion, they would pa&s;s through his hands; by which means he mu&s;t in time become the &s;ole governor of the empire, and at la&s;t be in a capacity of removing all ob&s;tacles to his ambition. He now therefore began to in&s;inuate to Tiberius the great and numerous inconveniencies of the city, the fatigues of attending the &s;enate, and the &s;editious temper of the inferior citizens of Rome. Tiberius, either prevailed upon by his per&s;ua&s;ions, or pur&s;uing the natural turn of his temper, which led to indolence and debauch|ery, in the twelfth year of his reign left Rome, and went into Campania, under pretence of de|dicating temples to Jupiter and Augu&s;tus. After this, tho' he removed to &s;everal places, he never returned to Rome, but &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time in the i&s;land of Ca|prea, a place which was rendered as infamous by his plea&s;ures, as dete&s;table by his cruelties, which were &s;hocking to human nature. For having, in pur&s;uance of his intentions, de|dicated the temples which he had built in Cam|pania, he publi&s;hed an edict, forbidding all per&s;ons to di&s;turb his repo&s;e, and &s;topt the concour&s;e of his &s;ubjects, by placing &s;oldiers in the ways which led to his palace. But &s;till growing weary of places where mankind might follow him with their complaints and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he withdrew him&s;elf, as was &s;aid,
<PB N="144" REF="150">
into that mo&s;t delightful i&s;land of Caprea, three miles from the continent, and oppo&s;ite Naples. Buried in this retreat, he gave him|&s;elf up to his plea&s;ures, quite regardle&s;s of the mi&s;eries of his &s;ubjects. Thus an in&s;urrection of the Jews, upon placing his &s;tatue in Jeru|&s;alem, under the government of Pontius Pilate, gave him no &s;ort of unea&s;ine&s;s. The falling of an amphitheatre at Fidenae, in which fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons were either killed or wound|ed, no way affected his repo&s;e. He was only employed in &s;tudying how to vary his odious plea&s;ures, and forcing his feeble frame, &s;hat|tered by age and former debaucheries, into the enjoyment of them. Nothing can pre&s;ent a more horrid picture than the retreat of this impure old man, attended in this place by all the mini&s;ters of his perverted appetites. He was at this time &s;ixty-&s;even years old; his per&s;on was mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing; and &s;ome &s;ay the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of it, in a great mea&s;ure, drove him into retirement. He was quite bald be|fore, his face was all broke out into ulcers, and covered over with plai&s;ters; his body was bowed forward, while its extreme height and leanne&s;s, encrea&s;ed its deformity. With &s;uch a per&s;on, and a mind &s;till more hideous, being gloomy, &s;u&s;picious, and cruel, he &s;ate down with a view rather of forcing his appetites than &s;atisfying them. He &s;pent whole nights in de|baucheries
<PB N="145" REF="151">
baucheries at the table; and he appointed Pomponius Flaccus, and Lucius Pi&s;o, to the fir&s;t po&s;ts of the empire, for no other merit than that of having &s;ate up with him two days and two nights without interruption. The&s;e he called his friends of all hours. He made one Novelius Torgnatus a praetor, for being able to drink off five bottles of wine at a draught. His luxuries of another kind were &s;till more dete&s;table, and &s;eemed to encrea&s;e with his drunkenne&s;s and glutonny. He made the mo&s;t eminent women of Rome &s;ub&s;ervient to his lu&s;ts, and all his inventions only &s;eemed calculated how to make his vices more extrava|gant and abominable. Here he invented rooms adapted to his libidinous exerci&s;es, where he made u&s;e of all manner of incentives, which nothing but the depraved imagination of a tyrant could delight in. The numberle&s;s ob|&s;cene medals dug up in that i&s;land at this day, bear witne&s;s at once to his &s;hame, and the veracity of the hi&s;torians who have de&s;cribed his debaucheries. In &s;hort, in this retreat, which was &s;urrounded with rocks on every &s;ide, he quite gave up the bu&s;ine&s;s of the empire; or, if he was ever active, it was only to do mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>In fact, it had been happy for mankind, had he given up his &s;u&s;picions, when he declined the fatigues of reigning, and re&s;igned the will
<PB N="146" REF="152">
to do harm, when he dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the power of doing good. But from the time of his retreat he became more cruel, and Sejanus always endeavoured to encrea&s;e his di&s;tru&s;ts. Secret &s;pies and informers were placed in all parts of the city, who converted the mo&s;t harmle&s;s actions into &s;ubjects of offence. If any per&s;on of merit te&s;tified any concern for the glory of the empire, it was immediately con&s;trued into a de&s;ign to obtain it. If an|other &s;poke with regret of former liberty, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to aim at re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the com|monwealth. Every action became liable to forced interpretations; joy expre&s;t an hope of the prince's death; melancholy, an envying of his pro&s;perity. Sejanus found his aims every day &s;ucceeding; the wretched emperor's ter|rors were an in&s;trument that he wrought upon at his plea&s;ure, and by which he levelled every ob&s;tacle to his de&s;igns. But the chief objects of his jealou&s;y were the children of Germani|cus, whom he re&s;olved to put out of the way. He therefore &s;edulou&s;ly continued to render them obnoxious to the emperor, to alarm him with fal&s;e reports of their ambition, and to terrify them with alarms of his intended cruelty. By the&s;e means, he &s;o contrived to widen the breach, that he actually produced on both &s;ides tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which he pretended to obviate; till at length, the two princes,
<PB N="147" REF="153">
Nero and Dru&s;us, were declared enemies to the &s;tate, and afterwards &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on, while Agrippina, their mother, was &s;ent into bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of their pretended crimes, many others lo&s;t their lives. Sabinus, who was attached to their intere&s;ts, was accu&s;ed and con|demned by a mo&s;t vile combination of infor|mers again&s;t him. A&s;inius Gallus was &s;en|tenced to remain in pri&s;on only to encrea&s;e the rigour of his puni&s;hment by a lingering death. Syriacus was condemned and executed, merely for being a friend to the latter. In this man|ner Sejanus proceeded, removing all who &s;tood between him and the empire, and every day encrea&s;ing in confidence with Tiberius, and power with the &s;enate. The number of his &s;tatues exceeded even tho&s;e of the emperor; people &s;wore by his fortune, in the &s;ame man|ner as they would have done, had he been actually upon the throne, and he was more dreaded than even the tyrant who actually en|joyed the empire. But the rapidity of his ri&s;e &s;eemed only preparatory to the greatne&s;s of his downfall. All we know of his fir&s;t di&s;grace with the emperor is, that Satrius Secundus was the man who had the boldne&s;s to accu&s;e him. Antonia, the mother of Germanicus, &s;e|conded the accu&s;ation. What were the parti|culars of his crimes, we now cannot learn; but
<PB N="148" REF="154">
certain it is, that he attempted to u&s;urp the empire by aiming at the life of Tiberius. He was very near di&s;patching him, when his prac|tices were di&s;covered, and his own life was very opportunely &s;ub&s;tituted to that again&s;t which he aimed. Tiberius, &s;en&s;ible of the traitor's power, proceeded with his u&s;ual di&s;&s;imulation in having him apprehended. He granted him new honours at the very time he re&s;olved his death, and took him as his colleague in the con|&s;ul&s;hip. The emperor's letter to the &s;enate began only with &s;light complaints again&s;t his friend, but ended with an order for putting him in pri&s;on. He entreated the &s;enators to protect a poor old man, as he was, abandoned by all; and in the mean time prepared &s;hips for his flight, and ordered &s;oldiers for his &s;ecurity. The &s;e|nate, who had long been jealous of the favou|rite's power, and dreaded his cruelty, imme|diately took this opportunity of going beyond their orders. In&s;tead of &s;entencing him to im|pri&s;onment, they directed his execution. A &s;trange revolution now appeared in the city: of tho&s;e numbers that but a moment before were pre&s;&s;ing into the pre&s;ence of Sejanus with offers of &s;ervice and adulation, not one was found that would &s;eem to be of his ac|quaintance: he was de&s;erted by all; and tho&s;e who had formerly received the greate&s;t bene|fits from him, &s;eemed now converted into his
<PB N="149" REF="155">
mo&s;t inveterate enemies. As he was conduct|ing to execution, the people loaded him with in&s;ult and execration. He attempted to hide his face with his hands, but even this was de|nied him, and his hands were &s;ecured. He was pur&s;ued with &s;arca&s;tic reproaches, his &s;ta|tues were in&s;tantly thrown down, and he him|&s;elf &s;hortly after &s;trangled by the executioner. Nor did the rage of his enemies &s;ub&s;ide with his death; his body was ignominiou&s;ly dragged about the &s;treets, and his whole family exe|cuted with him. Such was the end of Sejanus; a &s;triking example of the in&s;tability of every fa|vourite's power, and the precariou&s;ne&s;s of every tyrant's friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>His death only lighted up the emperor's rage for further executions. Plancina, the wife of Pi&s;o, was put to death as little pitied as the former. Sextus Ve&s;tilius &s;hared the &s;ame fate, as it was pretended, for having written a &s;atire again&s;t Caligula, the only &s;urviving &s;on of Germanicus; but his real fault was, that his &s;evere virtues were become intolerable to the vicious emperor. Ve&s;cularius Atticus, and Ju|lius Marinus, formerly the in&s;eparable friends of Tiberius, and who had been his compa|nions in Rhodes, were now executed by his command for being attached to Sejanus; and Mamercus Scaurus was al&s;o obliged to prevent his execution by &s;uicide, for having written a
<PB N="150" REF="156">
tragedy upon the &s;tory of Atreus. The &s;u&s;pi|cious emperor applied to him&s;elf the invective that was alledged again&s;t tyrants in general; and declared, in a rage, that if he was become an Atreus, he would compel the author to be|come an Ajax. Vitia, an aged woman, was put to death, only for having lamented the execu|tion of her &s;on. Fufius, and his wife Publia, being accu&s;ed of trea&s;on again&s;t the emperor, were obliged to prevent their condemnation by &s;uicide. Confidius Proculus, as he was chearfully employed among&s;t his friends, in celebrating his birth-day, found him&s;elf, in an in&s;tant, dragged before the &s;enate, accu&s;ed of con&s;piring again&s;t the emperor, condemned, and executed: the whole family of Theopha|nes was treated with the &s;ame cruel expedition. Sextus Marius found his riches and the beauty of his daughter &s;ufficient cau&s;es to procure his conviction and death. The pri&s;ons were crowded with pretended accomplices in the con&s;piracy of Sejanus. Tiberius began to grow weary of parti|cular executions; he therefore gave orders, that all the accu&s;ed &s;hould be put to death together, without further examination. The whole city was filled with &s;laughter and mourning. The place of execution was a deplorable &s;cene, where per|&s;ons of every &s;ex and age were expo&s;ed, racked and mangled; dead bodies putrefying, lay heaped on each other, while even the friends
<PB N="151" REF="157">
of the wretched convicts were denied the &s;ati&s;|faction of weeping. Thus mi&s;erable were the Romans, under the arbitrary rod of this gloomy tyrant; no per&s;on, though ever &s;o virtuous, could be &s;afe; or, rather, every virtue was but an approach to new dangers. Of twenty &s;e|nators, whom he cho&s;e for his council, he put &s;ixteen to death. "Let them hate me," cried he, "&s;o long as they obey me." He even averred, that Priam was an happy man, who outlived all his po&s;terity. In this manner there was not a day without &s;ome barbarous execu|tion, in which the &s;ufferers were obliged to underdergo the mo&s;t &s;hameful indignities and exqui&s;ite torments. When one Carnulius had killed him&s;elf, to avoid the torture: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah," cried Tiberius, "how has that man been able to e&s;cape me!"</Q> When a pri&s;oner ear|ne&s;tly intreated, that he would not defer his death: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No," cried the tyrant. "I am not &s;ufficiently your friend, to &s;horten your tor|ment."</Q> Sometimes he was more joco&s;e in his cruelties, particularly when a certain man, &s;topping an hear&s;e, de&s;ired the dead body to tell Augu&s;tus, that his legacies to the people were yet unpaid. Tiberius &s;ent for him, and having paid him his &s;hare, cau&s;ed him to be immedi|ately executed; bidding him go tell Augu&s;tus, that he, at lea&s;t, had been &s;atisfied. One would have thought that &s;uch cruelties, exer|ci&s;ed

at Rome, would have &s;atiated his love of vengeance; but Caprea it&s;elf, the place &s;ecluded for his plea&s;ures and his ea&s;e, was daily conta|minated, not le&s;s with his cruelties than his debauchery. He often &s;atisfied his eyes with the tortures of the wretches who were put to death before him; and in the days of Sueto|nius the rock was to be &s;een, from which he ordered &s;uch as had di&s;plea&s;ed him to be thrown headlong. As he was one day examining &s;ome per&s;ons upon the rack, he was told that an old friend of his was come from Rhodes to &s;ee him. Tiberius &s;uppo&s;ing him brought for the pur|po&s;es of information, immediately ordered him to the torture; and when he was convinced of his mi&s;take, he ordered him to be to put to death, to prevent farther di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In this manner, did the tyrant continue to torment others, although he was him&s;elf &s;till more tortured by his own &s;u&s;picions. In one of his letters to the &s;enate, he confe&s;&s;ed that the gods and godde&s;&s;es had &s;o afflicted and con|founded him, that he knew not what, or how to write: and, in fact, he had every rea&s;on for &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion; a plotting &s;enate, a reviling people, his bodily infirmities encrea&s;ed by his luxuries, and his neare&s;t friends con&s;cious of being &s;u&s;pected. The dome&s;tic policy of the empire, al&s;o, was in the hands of mi&s;creants; and the frontier provinces were invaded with
<PB N="153" REF="159">
impunity. Me&s;ia was &s;eized on by the Dacians and Sarmatians; Gaul was wa&s;ted by the Ger|mans, and Armenia conquered, by the king of Parthia. The&s;e were lo&s;&s;es that might excite the vigilance of any other governor but Tibe|rius. He, however, was &s;o much a &s;lave to his brutal appetites, that he left his provinces wholly to the care of his lieutenants, and they were intent rather on the accumulation of pri|vate fortune, than the &s;afety of the &s;tate. Such a total di&s;order in the empire, might be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed to produce a degree of anxiety in him who governed it; &s;o that he was heard to wi&s;h, that Heaven and earth might pe|ri&s;h with him when he died.</P>
<P>In this manner he lived, odious to all the world, and trouble&s;ome to him&s;elf; an enemy to the lives of others, and a tormentor of his own. At length, however, in the twenty-&s;econd year of his reign, he began to feel the ap|proaches of his di&s;&s;olution, and all his appetites totally to for&s;ake him. He now, therefore, found it was time to think of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and he&s;itated for a long while, whether he &s;hould chu&s;e Caligula, who&s;e vices were too apparent to e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation. He had been often heard to &s;ay, that this youth had all the faults of Sylla, without his virtues; that he was a &s;erpent that would &s;ting the empire, and a Phaeton that would &s;et the world in a flame.
<PB N="154" REF="160">
However, notwith&s;tanding all his well-ground|ed apprehen&s;ions, he named him for his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or; willing, perhaps, by the enormity of Caligula's conduct, to cover the memory of his own.</P>
<P>But though he thought fit to chu&s;e a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, he could by no means think of dying: though totally for&s;aken by his appetites and enjoyments, his di&s;&s;imulation never for&s;ook him: he, therefore, concealed his approaching decline with the utmo&s;t care, as if he was wil|ling at once to hide it from the world and him|&s;elf. He long had a contempt for phy&s;ic, and refu&s;ed the advice of &s;uch as attended him: he even &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in being pre&s;ent at the &s;ports of the &s;oldiers, and ventured him|&s;elf to throw a javelin at a boar that was let loo&s;e before him. The effort which he made upon this occa&s;ion, cau&s;ed a pain in his &s;ide, which ha&s;tened the approaches of death: &s;till, however, he &s;eemed willing to avoid his end; and &s;trove, by change of place, to put off the inquietude of his own reflections. He left his favourite i&s;land, and went upon the continent: he at la&s;t fixed at the promontory of Mi&s;enum, in a hou&s;e that formerly had belonged to Lu|cullus. It was here that Charicles, his phy&s;i|cian, pretending to ki&s;s his hand, felt the fai|lure of his pul&s;e, and apprized Macro, the em|peror's pre&s;ent favourite, that he had not above
<PB N="155" REF="161">
two days to live. Tiberius, on the contrary, who had perceived the art of Charicles, did all in his power to impre&s;s his attendants with an opinion of his health: he continued at table till the evening; he &s;aluted all his gue&s;ts as they left the room, and read the acts of the &s;enate, in which they had ab&s;olved &s;ome per&s;ons he had written again&s;t with great indignation. He re&s;olved to take &s;ignal vengeance of their di&s;o|bedience, and meditated new &s;chemes of cruelty, when he fell into &s;uch faintings, as all believed were fatal. It was in this &s;ituation, that, by Macro's advice, Caligula prepared to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He received the congratulations of the whole court, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be ac|knowledged by the Praetorian &s;oldiers, and went forth from the emperor's apartment amid&s;t the applau&s;es of the multitude; when all of a &s;udden he was informed that the emperor was recovered, that he had begun to &s;peak, and de|&s;ired to eat. This unexpected account filled the whole court with terror and alarm: every one who had before been earne&s;t in te&s;tifying their joy, now re-a&s;&s;umed their pretended &s;orrow, and left the new emperor, through a feigned &s;olicitude for the fate of the old. Caligula him|&s;elf &s;eemed thunder&s;truck; he pre&s;erved a gloomy &s;ilence, expecting nothing but death, in&s;tead of the empire at which he had a&s;pired. Macro, however, who was hardened in crime,
<PB N="156" REF="162">
ordered that the dying emperor &s;hould be di&s;|patched, by &s;mothering him with pillows, or, as others will have it, by poi&s;on. In this manner Tiberius died in the &s;eventy-eighth year of his age, after reigning twenty-two.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="790" UNIT="U. C."> Little can be added to the character of a <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="A.D."> prince, who, in every in&s;tance, was &s;o &s;trongly marked with cruelty and di&s;&s;imulation. It only remains, therefore, to characterize the peo|ple whom he governed. The Romans were, at this time, arrived at their highe&s;t pitch of effeminacy and vice. The wealth of almo&s;t every nation of the empire, having, for &s;ome time, circulated through the city, brought with it the luxuries peculiar to each country; &s;o that Rome pre&s;ented a dete&s;table picture of various pollution. In this reign lived Appicius, &s;o well known for having reduced gluttony into &s;y&s;tem; &s;ome of the notorious in this way, thought it no &s;hame to give near an hundred pounds for a &s;ingle fi&s;h, and exhau&s;t a fortune of fifty thou&s;and pounds in one entertainment. Debaucheries of every other kind kept pace with this; while the dete&s;table folly of the times thought it was refining upon plea&s;ure to make it unnatural. There were at Rome men called Spintriae, who&s;e &s;ole trade it was, to &s;tudy new modes of plea&s;ure; and the&s;e were univer|&s;ally favourites of the great. The &s;enators were long fallen from their authority, and were no le&s;s
<PB N="157" REF="163">
e&s;tranged from their integrity and honour. Their whole &s;tudy &s;eemed to be, how to invent new ways of flattering the emperor, and various methods of tormenting his &s;uppo&s;ed enemies. The people were &s;till more corrupt; they had, for &s;ome years, been accu&s;tomed to live in idlene&s;s, upon the donations of the emperor; and, being &s;a|tisfied with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, entirely gave up their freedom. Too effeminate and cowardly to go to war, they only railed again&s;t their governors; &s;o that they were bad &s;oldiers, and &s;editious ci|tizens. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that &s;uch indifferent &s;ubjects &s;hould be indiffe|rently governed. It has been often a&s;ked, how &s;o many of the emperors were bad princes. The an&s;wer is ea&s;y&mdash;becau&s;e the people they had brought to command, were ill di&s;po&s;ed to obey. Good &s;ubjects generally make good kings; while luxury, &s;edition, di&s;content and murmurs in the populace, as u&s;ually produce &s;everity, cruelty and &s;u&s;picion in him who is appointed to govern. Little more need be &s;aid of the&s;e times, but that in the eighteenth year of this monarch's reign, Chri&s;t was cruci|fied; as if the univer&s;al depravity of man|kind, wanted no le&s;s a &s;acrifice than that of God him&s;elf, to reclaim them. Shortly after his death, Pilate wrote to Tiberius an account of his pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;urrection and miracles; upon which the emperor made a report of the whole
<PB N="158" REF="164">
to the &s;enate, de&s;iring that Chri&s;t might be ac|counted a God by the Romans. But the &s;enate being di&s;plea&s;ed that the propo&s;al had not come fir&s;t from them&s;elves, refu&s;ed to allow of his apotheo&s;is; alledging an ancient law, which gave them the &s;uperintendance in all matters of religion. They even went &s;o far as, by an edict, to command, that all Chri&s;tians &s;hould leave the city; but Tiberius, by another edict, threatened death to all &s;uch as &s;hould accu&s;e them; by which means they continued unmo|le&s;ted during the re&s;t of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. CALIGULA, the Fourth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>NO monarch ever came to the throne with more advantages than Caligula. He was the &s;on of Germanicus, who had been the darling of the army and the people. He was bred among the &s;oldiers, from whom he received the name of Caligula, from the &s;hort bu&s;kin, called Caliga, that was worn by the common centinels, and which was al&s;o u&s;ually worn by him. He &s;ucceeded a mercile&s;s tyrant; after whom, even moderate merit would look like excellence. Wherefore, as he approached Rome, the principal men of the &s;tate went out in crowds to meet him. He received the con|gratulations of the people on every &s;ide, all equally plea&s;ed in being free from the cruelties of Tiberius, and in hoping new advantages from the virtues of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Caligula &s;eemed to take every precaution, to impre&s;s them with the opinion of an happy change. Amid&s;t the rejoicings of the multi|tude, he advanced mourning, with the dead body of Tiberius, which the &s;oldiers brought to be burnt at Rome, according to the cu&s;tom
<PB N="160" REF="166">
of that time. Upon his entrance into the city, he was received with new titles of honour by the &s;enate, who&s;e chief employment &s;eemed now to be, the art of encrea&s;ing their emperor's vanity. He was left coheir with Gemellus, grand&s;on to Tiberius; but they &s;et a&s;ide the nomination, and declared Caligula &s;ole &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the empire. The joy for this election was not confined to the narrow bounds of Italy, it &s;pread through the whole empire, and victims with|out number were &s;acrificed upon the occa&s;ion. Some of the people, upon his going into the i&s;land of Campania, made vows for his return; and &s;hortly after, when he fell &s;ick, the mul|titude crowded whole nights round his palace, and &s;ome even devoted them&s;elves to death, in ca&s;e he recovered, &s;etting up bills of their re&s;o|lutions in the &s;treets. In this affection of the ci|tizens, &s;trangers them&s;elves &s;eemed ambitious of &s;haring. Artabanus, king of Parthia, who took every method of contemning his prede|ce&s;&s;or, &s;ought the pre&s;ent emperor's alliance with a&s;&s;iduity. He came to a per&s;onal confe|rence with one of his legates; he pa&s;&s;ed the Euphrates, he adored the Roman eagles; and ki&s;&s;ed the emperor's images; &s;o that the whole world &s;eemed combined to prai&s;e him for vir|tues, which their hopes, and not their experi|ence, had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167">
Thus all the enormities of this emperor were concealed in the beginning of his reign. He, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed extremely careful of the pub|lic; and having performed the funeral &s;olem|nities of Tiberius, he ha&s;tened to the i&s;lands of Pandataria and Pontia, to remove the a&s;hes of his mother and brothers, expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the danger of tempe&s;tuous weather, to give a lu&s;tre to his piety. Having brought them to Rome, he ordained annual &s;olemnities in their honour, and ordered the month of September to be called Germanicus, in memory of his father. The&s;e ceremonies being over, he con|ferred the &s;ame honours upon his grandmother Antonia, which had before been given to Livia; and ordered all informations to be burnt, that any ways expo&s;ed the enemies of his family. He even refu&s;ed a paper that was offered him, tending to the di&s;covery of a con|&s;piracy again&s;t him; alledging, That he was con&s;cious of nothing to de&s;erve any man's hatred, and therefore had no fears from their machina|tions. He cau&s;ed the in&s;titutions of Augu&s;tus, which had been di&s;u&s;ed in the reign of Tiberius, to be revived; he undertook to reform many abu&s;es in the &s;tate, and &s;everely puni&s;hed cor|rupt governors. Among others, he bani&s;hed Pontius Pilate into Gaul, where this unju&s;t magi&s;trate afterwards put an end to his life by &s;uicide. He &s;trictly in&s;pected the behaviour
<PB N="162" REF="168">
of the knights, whom he publicly degraded upon being found guilty of any infamous crime.</P>
<P>He bani&s;hed, without remi&s;&s;ion, the Spin|triae, or inventors of abominable recreations, from Rome. He attempted to re&s;tore the ancient manner of electing magi&s;trates by the &s;uffrages of the people, and gave them a free juri&s;diction, without any appeal to him&s;elf. Although the will of Tiberius was annulled by the &s;enate, and that of Livia &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Ti|berius, yet he cau&s;ed all their legacies to be punctually paid; and, in order to make Ge|mellus amends for mi&s;&s;ing the crown, he cau&s;ed him to be elected Princeps Juventutis, or principal of the Youth. He re&s;tored &s;ome kings to their dominions, who had been unju&s;tly di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Tiberius, and gave them the ar|rears of their revenues. And, that he might ap|pear an encourager of every virtue, he ordered a female &s;lave a large &s;um of money for en|during the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments, without di&s;covering the &s;ecrets of her ma&s;ter. So many conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch apparent virtue, could not fail of receiving ju&s;t applau&s;e. A &s;hield of gold, bearing his image, was decreed to be carried annually to the Capitol, attended by the &s;enate, and the &s;ons of the nobility, &s;inging in prai&s;e of the emperor's virtues. It was like|wi&s;e ordained, that the day on which he was appointed to the empire &s;hould be called Pu|bitia;
<PB N="163" REF="169">
implying, that when he came to govern, the city received a new foundation.</P>
<P>But it had been happy for him and the em|pire, had &s;uch a beginning been as &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained. In le&s;s than eight months all this &s;hew of moderation and clemency vani&s;hed; while furious pa&s;&s;ions, unexampled avarice, and capricious cruelty, began to take their turn in his mind. As mo&s;t of the cruelties of Tibe|rius aro&s;e from &s;u&s;picion, &s;o mo&s;t of tho&s;e com|mitted by Caligula took ri&s;e from prodigality. Some indeed pretend to a&s;&s;ert, that a di&s;order which happened &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the empire, entirely di&s;torted his rea&s;on, and di&s;|compo&s;ed his under&s;tanding. However this may be, madne&s;s it&s;elf could &s;carce dictate cruelties more extravagant, or incon&s;i&s;tencies more ridiculous than are imputed to him; &s;ome of them appear almo&s;t beyond belief, as they &s;eem entirely without any motive to incite &s;uch barbarities.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of his cruelty, and one that will &s;carcely be regretted by po&s;terity, was a per&s;on named Politus, who had devoted him|&s;elf to death, in ca&s;e the emperor, who was then &s;ick, &s;hould recover. When Caligula's health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he was informed of the zeal of Politus, and actually compelled him to complete his vow. This ridiculous devotee was therefore led round the city, by
<PB N="164" REF="170">
children, adorned with chaplets, and then put to death, being thrown headlong from the ramparts. Another, named Secundus, had vow|ed to fight in the amphitheatre upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion. To this he was al&s;o compelled, the emperor him&s;elf chu&s;ing to be a &s;pectator of the combat. However, he was more fortu|nate than the former, being &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to kill his adver&s;ary, by which he obtained a re|lea&s;e from his vow. Gemellus was the next who &s;uffered from the tyrant's inhumanity. The pretence again&s;t him was, that he had wi&s;hed the emperor might not recover, and that he had taken a counter-poi&s;on to &s;ecure him from any &s;ecret attempts again&s;t his life. Caligula ordered him to kill him&s;elf; but as the unfor|tunate youth was ignorant of the manner of do|ing it, the emperor's me&s;&s;engers &s;oon in&s;truct|ed him in the fatal le&s;&s;on. Silenus, the em|peror's father-in-law, was the next that was put to death upon &s;light &s;u&s;picions; and Grecinus&punc; a &s;enator of noted integrity, refu&s;ing to witne&s;s fal&s;ely again&s;t him, &s;hared his fate. After fol|lowed a crowd of victims to the emperor's ava|rice or &s;u&s;picion. The pretext again&s;t them was their enmity to his family; and in proof of his accu&s;ations he produced the&s;e very memorials, which but a while before he pretended to have burnt. Among the number of tho&s;e who were &s;acrificed to his jealou&s;y, was Macro, the late
<PB N="165" REF="171">
favourite of Tiberius, and the per&s;on to whom Caligula owed his empire. He was accu&s;ed of many crimes, &s;ome of which were common to the emperor, as well as to him, and his death brought on the ruin of his whole family.</P>
<P>The&s;e cruelties, however, only &s;eemed the fir&s;t fruits of a mind naturally timid and &s;u&s;pi|cious: his vanity and profu&s;ion &s;oon gave ri&s;e to others which were more attrocious, as they &s;prung from le&s;s powerful motives. His pride fir&s;t began by a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the title of ruler, which was u&s;ually granted only to kings. He would al&s;o have taken the crown and dia|dem, had he not been advi&s;ed that he was al|ready &s;uperior to all the monarchs of the world. Not long after he a&s;&s;umed divine honours, and gave him&s;elf the names of &s;uch divinities as he thought mo&s;t agreeable to his nature. For this purpo&s;e he cau&s;ed the heads of the &s;tatues of Jupiter and &s;ome other gods to be &s;truck off, and his own to be put in their places. He frequently &s;eated him&s;elf between Ca&s;tor and Pollux, and ordered that all who came to their temple to wor&s;hip, &s;hould pay their adorations only to him. However, &s;uch was the extrava|gant incon&s;tancy of this unaccountable ideot, that he changed his divinity as often as he changed his cloaths. Being at one time a male deity, at another a female; &s;ometimes Jupiter or Mars, and not unfrequently Venus or Diana.
<PB N="166" REF="172">
He even built and dedicated a temple to his own divinity, in which his &s;tatue of gold was every day dre&s;t in &s;imilar robes to tho&s;e which he him&s;elf wore, and was wor&s;hipped by crowds of adorers. His prie&s;ts were numerous, the &s;a|crifices made to him were of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delicacies that could be procured, and the dig|nity of the prie&s;thood was &s;ought by the mo&s;t oppulent men of the city. However, he ad|mitted his wife and his hor&s;e to that honour; and, to give a fini&s;hing &s;troke to his ab&s;urdities, he became a prie&s;t to him&s;elf. His method of a&s;&s;uming the manners of a deity was not le&s;s ri|diculous: he often went out in the full moon, and courted it in the &s;tyle of a lover. He often invited it to his bed, to ta&s;te the plea|&s;ure of his embraces. He employed many in|ventions to imitate thunder, and would fre|quently defy Jupiter, crying out from a &s;peech of Homer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do you conquer me, or I will conquer you."</Q> He frequently pretended to conver&s;e in whi&s;pers with the &s;tatue of Jupiter, and u&s;ually &s;eemed angry at its replies; threat|ening to &s;end it packing into Greece. Some|times, however, he would a&s;&s;ume a better temper, and &s;eemed contented that they two &s;hould dwell together in amity.</P>
<P>A per&s;on &s;o impious re&s;pecting the deity, was &s;till more criminal with regard to man. He was not le&s;s notorious for the depravation of
<PB N="167" REF="173">
his appetites, than for his ridiculous pre&s;ump|tions. Neither per&s;on, place, nor &s;ex were ob|&s;tacles to the indulgence of his unnatural lu&s;ts. There was &s;carce a lady of any quality in Rome that e&s;caped his lewdne&s;s; and, indeed, &s;uch was the degeneracy of the times, that there were few ladies then who did not think this di&s;grace an honour. He committed ince&s;t with his three &s;i&s;ters, and at public fea&s;ts they lay with their heads upon his bo&s;om by turns. Of the&s;e he pro&s;tituted Livia and Agrippina to his vile com|panions, and then bani&s;hed them as adultre&s;&s;es and con&s;pirators again&s;t his per&s;on. As for Dru&s;illa, he took her from her hu&s;band Lon|ginus, and kept her as his wife. Her he loved &s;o affectionately, that, being &s;ick, he appointed her as heire&s;s of his empire and fortune; and &s;he happening to die before him, he made her a godde&s;s. Nor did her example, when living, appear more dangerous to the people than her divinity, when dead. To mourn for her death was a crime, as &s;he was become a godde&s;s; and to rejoice for her deity, was capital, becau&s;e &s;he was dead. Nay, even &s;ilence it&s;elf was an un|pardonable in&s;en&s;ibility, either of the emperor's lo&s;s or his &s;i&s;ter's advancement. Thus he made his &s;i&s;ter &s;ub&s;ervient to his profit, as before he had done to his plea&s;ure; rai&s;ing va&s;t &s;ums of money by granting pardons to &s;ome, and by confi&s;cating the goods of others. As to his
<PB N="168" REF="174">
marriages, whether he contracted them with greater levity, or di&s;&s;olved them with greater in|ju&s;tice, is not ea&s;y to determine. Being pre|&s;ent at the nuptials of Livia Ore&s;tilla with Pi&s;o, as &s;oon as the &s;olemnity was over, he com|manded her to be brought to him as his own wife, and then di&s;mi&s;t her in a few days. He &s;oon after went &s;o far as to bani&s;h her upon &s;u&s;|picion of cohabiting with her hu&s;band after &s;he was parted from him. He was enamoured of Lollia Paulina, upon a bare relation of her grandmother's beauty; and thereupon took her from her hu&s;band who commanded in Mace|donia: notwith&s;tanding which he repudiated her as he had done the former, and likewi&s;e forbad her future marrying with any other. The wife who caught mo&s;t firmly upon his affections was Milonia Cae&s;onia, who&s;e chief merit lay in her perfect acquaintance with all the alluring arts of her &s;ex, for &s;he was otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;t neither of youth nor beauty. She continued with him during his reign, and he loved her &s;o ridi|culou&s;ly, that he &s;ometimes &s;hewed her to his &s;oldiers dre&s;t in armour, and &s;ometimes to his companions &s;tark naked; &s;o that his very re|gards were a reproach to tho&s;e whom he wi&s;hed to oblige.</P>
<P>His envy was &s;till more dete&s;table than his lu&s;ts. We are told that he put Caius to death for no other crime, than becau&s;e he wore a
<PB N="169" REF="175">
purple gown, the lu&s;tre of which called off all the regards of the &s;pectators from him&s;elf. He ordered &s;everal per&s;ons in the city to be &s;haved, for having hair more beautiful than ordinary. He ordered one Proculus, who was remark|able for his beauty and the tallne&s;s of his &s;ta|ture, to de&s;cend into the amphitheatre, and to fight among the combatants as a gladiator. Proculus came off victorious, having vanqui&s;h|ed two men one after the other. However, the tyrant was not &s;atisfied with this puni&s;h|ment, but cau&s;ed him to be bound and cloathed in rags, and then to be led round the city and &s;lain. Being pre&s;ent at the public games, where a particular gladiator &s;ucceeded with more than ordinary applau&s;e, he was &s;o highly di&s;plea&s;ed that he flung him&s;elf out of the amphitheatre in a fury, crying out with great indignation, that the Romans gave more honour to a pitiful fencer, than to the emperor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But of all his vices, his prodigality was the mo&s;t remarkable, and that which in &s;ome mea|&s;ure gave ri&s;e to the re&s;t. The luxuries of former emperors were &s;implicity it&s;elf, when compared to tho&s;e which he practi&s;ed. He contrived new ways of bathing, where the rich|e&s;t oils and mo&s;t precious perfumes were ex|hau&s;ted with the utmo&s;t profu&s;ion. He found out di&s;hes of immen&s;e value, and had even jewels, as we are told, di&s;&s;olved among his
<PB N="170" REF="176">
&s;auces. He &s;ometimes had &s;ervices of pure gold pre&s;ented before his gue&s;ts in&s;tead of meat, ob&s;erving, that a man &s;hould be an oeconomi&s;t or an emperor.</P>
<P>The expen&s;ive manner in which he main|tained his hor&s;e will give &s;ome idea of his do|me&s;tic oeconomy. He built it a &s;table of mar|ble, and a manger of ivory. Whenever this animal, which he called Incitatus, was to run, he placed centinels near its &s;table, the night preceding, to prevent its &s;lumbers from being broken. He appointed it an hou&s;e, furniture, and a kitchen, in order to treat all its vi&s;itors with proper re&s;pect. The emperor &s;ometimes invited Incitatus to his own table, pre&s;ented it with gilt oats, and wine in golden cup. He often &s;wore by the &s;afety of his hor&s;e, and it is &s;aid he would have named it to the con&s;ul&s;hip, had not death prevented.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days together he flung con&s;ider|able &s;ums of money among the people. He ordered &s;hips of a prodigious bulk to be built of cedar, the &s;terns of ivory inlaid with gold and jewels, the &s;ails and tackling of various &s;ilks, while the decks were planted with the choice&s;t fruit trees, under the &s;hade of which he often dined. Here, attended by all the mi|ni&s;ters of his plea&s;ures, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;ing|ers, and the mo&s;t beautiful youths, he coa&s;ted along the &s;hore of Campania with great &s;plen|dour.
<PB N="171" REF="177">
All his buildings &s;eemed rather calcu|lated to rai&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment, than to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of utility. He ordered hou&s;es to be built in the &s;ea; he cut his way through rocks of prodigious bulk; he levelled mountains, and elevated plains and valleys. But the mo&s;t no|torious in&s;tance of his fruitle&s;s profu&s;ion was the va&s;t bridge at Puteoli, which he undertook in the third year of his reign. To &s;atisfy his de&s;ire of being ma&s;ter as well of the ocean as the land, he cau&s;ed an in&s;inite number of &s;hips to be fa&s;tened to each other, &s;o as to make a floating bridge from Bai to Puteoli, acro&s;s an aim of the &s;ea three miles and an half broad. The &s;hips being placed in two rows, in form of a cre&s;cent, were &s;ecured to each other with anchors, chains and cables. Over the&s;e were laid va&s;t quantities of timber, and upon that earth, &s;o as to make the whole re&s;emble one of the &s;treets of Rome. He next cau&s;ed &s;everal hou&s;es to be built upon his new bridge, for the reception of him&s;elf and his attendants, into which fre&s;h water was conveyed by pipes from land. He then repaired thither with all his court, attended by prodigious throngs of people, who came from all parts, to be &s;pectators of &s;uch an expen&s;ive pageant. It was there that Caligula, adorned with all the magnificence of ea&s;tern royalty, &s;itting on hor&s;eback with a civic crown, and Alexander's brea&s;t-plate, attended
<PB N="172" REF="178">
by the great officers of the army, and all the nobility of Rome, entered at one end of the bridge, and with ridiculous importance rode to the other. At night, the number of torches and other illuminations with which this ex|pen&s;ive &s;tructure was adorned, ca&s;t &s;uch a gleam as illuminated the whole bay, and all the neigh|bouring mountains. This &s;eemed to give the weak emperor new cau&s;e for exultation, boa&s;t|ing that he had turned night into day, as well as &s;ea into land. The next morning he again rode over in a triumphant chariot, follow|ed by a numerous train of charioteers, and all his &s;oldiers in glittering armour. He then a&s;|cended a ro&s;trum erected for the occa&s;ion, where he made a &s;olemn oration in prai&s;e of the greatne&s;s of his enterprize, and the a&s;&s;iduity of his workmen and his army. He then di&s;tri|buted rewards among his men, and a &s;plendid fea&s;t &s;ucceeded. However, there was &s;till wanting &s;omething to mark the di&s;po&s;ition of the mighty projector. In the mid&s;t of the en|tertainment many of his attendants were thrown into the &s;ea; &s;everal &s;hips filled with &s;pectators, were attacked and &s;unk in an ho&s;tile manner; and, altho' the majority e&s;caped through the calmne&s;s of the weather, yet many were drown|ed&punc; and &s;ome who endeavoured to &s;ave them|&s;elves by climbing to the bridge, were &s;truck down again by the emperor's command. The
<PB N="173" REF="179">
calmne&s;s of the &s;ea during this pageant, which continued for two days, furni&s;hed Caligula with fre&s;h opportunities for boa&s;ting; being heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Neptune took care to keep the &s;ea &s;mooth and &s;erene, merely out of reverence to him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Expences like the&s;e, it may naturally be &s;up|po&s;ed, mu&s;t have exhau&s;ted the mo&s;t unbound|ed wealth: in fact, after reigning about a year, Caligula found his revenues totally exhau&s;ted; and a fortune of about eighteen millions of our money, which Tiberius had ama&s;&s;ed to|gether, entirely &s;pent in extravagance and folly. Now, therefore, his prodigality put him upon new methods of &s;upplying the exchequer; and, as before his profu&s;ion, &s;o now his rapacity became boundle&s;s. He put in practice all kinds of rapine and extortion; while his principal &s;tudy &s;eemed to be the inventing new impo&s;ts, and illicit con&s;i&s;cations. Every thing was taxed, to the very wages of the meane&s;t trade&s;man. He cau&s;ed freemen to purcha&s;e their freedom a &s;econd time; and poi&s;oned many who had named him for their heir, to have the immediate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their fortunes. He &s;et up a brothel in his own palace, by which he gained con&s;ider|able &s;ums by all the methods of pro&s;titution. He al&s;o kept a gaming hou&s;e, in which he him|&s;elf pre&s;ided, &s;crupling none of the mean tricks of that reptile race, in order to advance his
<PB N="174" REF="180">
gains. On a certain occa&s;ion, having had a run of ill luck, he &s;aw two rich knights pa&s;&s;ing through his court, upon which he &s;uddenly ro&s;e up, and cau&s;ing both to be apprehended, confi&s;cated their e&s;tates, and then joining his former companions, boa&s;ted that he never had a better throw in his life. Another time, want|ing money for a &s;take, he went down, and cau&s;ed &s;everal noblemen to be put to death, and then returning, told the company that they &s;ate playing for trifles, while he had won &s;ixty thou|&s;and &s;e&s;terces at a ca&s;t. Having had a daugh|ter born, he complained openly of his poverty, and publi&s;hed an edict that he would receive whatever pre&s;ents &s;hould be &s;ent him, and ac|tually &s;tood in the portico of his palace, to in|duce the people to be liberal in their dona|tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e methods, however, were but &s;ubor|dinate to the cruelties by which he acquired immen&s;e &s;ums. He &s;lew many of the &s;enate, and afterwards cited them to appear as if they had killed them&s;elves. He condemned many per&s;ons of the highe&s;t quality to dig in the mines, and to repair the high-ways, for offer|ing to ridicule his profu&s;ion. He ca&s;t great numbers of old and infirm men and poor de|crepid hou&s;ekeepers to wild bea&s;ts, to free the &s;tate from &s;uch un&s;erviceable citizens. He u&s;ually fed his wild bea&s;ts with the bodies of
<PB N="175" REF="181">
tho&s;e wretches whom he condemned; and every tenth day, &s;ent off numbers of them to be thus devoured; which he joco&s;ely called, clear|ing his accounts. One of tho&s;e who was thus expo&s;ed, crying out that he was innocent, Caligula ordered his tongue to be cut out, and then thrown into the amphitheatre as be|fore. He took delight in killing men with &s;low tortures, that, as he expre&s;t it, they might feel them&s;elves dying; being always pre&s;ent at &s;uch executions, him&s;elf directing the duration of the puni&s;hment, and mitigating the tortures, merely to prolong them. In fact, he valued him&s;elf for no quality more than this unrelent|ing temper, and inflexible &s;everity which he pre&s;erved while pre&s;iding at an execution.</P>
<P>His barbarous attempts at wit in the mid&s;t of &s;laughter, &s;ufficiently evince what little pain he felt from compa&s;&s;ion. An eminent citizen, who for an indi&s;po&s;ition had got leave to retire into the i&s;land Anticyra, which was a place fa|mous for curing madne&s;s by hellebore, de&s;iring to have his &s;tay prolonged, Caligula ordered him to be put to death; adding, with a &s;mile, That bleeding mu&s;t certainly be u&s;eful to one who had &s;o long taken hellebore without &s;ucce&s;s. Once putting a wrong per&s;on to death by mi&s;take, upon finding his error, he &s;aid it was well done, for this criminal had doubtle&s;s de&s;erved to die as well as the other. This horrid di&s;po&s;i|&s;ition
<PB N="176" REF="182">
never for&s;ook him, even in his mo&s;t fe&s;|tive hours: he frequently had men racked be|fore him, while he &s;ate at meat, ironically pity|ing their misfortunes, and blaming their execu|tioner. He always de&s;ired to have the friends and relations of the &s;ufferer to be pre&s;ent at the&s;e executions. Upon a certain occa&s;ion one of them excu&s;ing him&s;elf upon account of &s;ickne&s;s, the tyrant &s;ent a litter to carry him. Whenever he ki&s;&s;ed his wife or mi&s;tre&s;s, he generally laid his hand on her neck, ob&s;erving, that, however &s;mooth and lovely it was, he could take it off when he plea&s;ed. Demanding of one whom he had recalled from bani&s;hment, how he employed him&s;elf in his exile; being told, that he had prayed for the death of Tiberius, Caligula immediately concluded, that all whom he him|&s;elf had bani&s;hed, wi&s;hed for his death likewi&s;e&punc; commanded that all exiles &s;hould be &s;lain without mercy. At one time, being incen&s;ed with the citizens of Rome, he wi&s;hed that all the Roman people had but one neck, that he might di&s;patch them at a blow.</P>
<P>Such in&s;upportable and capricious cruelties produced many &s;ecret con&s;piracies again&s;t him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the&s;e were for a while deferred, upon ac|count of his intended expedition again&s;t the Germans and Britains, which he undertook in <MILESTONE N="793" UNIT="U.

parts of the empire, and talked with &s;o much re&s;olution, that it was univer&s;ally believed he would conquer all before him. His march perfectly indicated the inequality of his temper: &s;ometimes it was &s;o rapid that the cohorts were obliged to leave their &s;tandards behind them; at other times it was &s;o &s;low, that it more re&s;em|bled a pompous proce&s;&s;ion than a military ex|pedition. In this di&s;po&s;ition he would cau&s;e him&s;elf to be carried on eight mens' &s;houlders, and order all the neighbouring cities to have their &s;treets well &s;wept and watered, to defend him from the du&s;t. However, all the&s;e mighty preparations ended in nothing. In&s;tead of con|quering Britain, he only gave refuge to one of its bani&s;hed princes; and this he de&s;cribed in his letter to the &s;enate, as taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole i&s;land. In&s;tead of conquering Ger|many, he only led his army to the &s;ea-&s;hore, in Batavia. There di&s;po&s;ing his engines and war|like machines with great &s;olemnity, and drawing up his men in order of battle, he went on board his galley, with which coa&s;ting along, he com|manded his trumpets to &s;ound, and the &s;ignal to be given as if for an engagement; upon which, his men, having had previous orders, immediately fell to gathering the &s;hells that lay upon the &s;hore into their helmets, terming them the &s;poils of the conquered ocean, wor|thy of the palace and the Capitol. After this
<PB N="178" REF="184">
doughty expedition, calling his army together, as a general after victory, he harangued them in a pompous manner, and highly extolled their atchievements; and then di&s;tributing money among them, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with orders to be joyful, and congratulated them upon their riches. But that &s;uch exploits &s;hould not pa&s;s without a memorial, he cau&s;ed a lofty tower to be erected by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and ordered the galleys in which he had put to &s;ea, to be con|veyed to Rome in a great mea&s;ure by land.</P>
<P>After numberle&s;s in&s;tances of folly and cru|elty in this expedition, among which he had intentions of de&s;troying the whole army, that had formerly mutinied under his father Germa|nicus, he began to think of a triumph. The &s;enate, who had long been the timid mini&s;ters of his pride and cruelty, immediately &s;et about con&s;ulting how to &s;atisfy his expectations. They con&s;idered that a triumph would, even to him|&s;elf, appear as a burle&s;que upon his expedition: they therefore decreed him only an ovation. Having come to this re&s;olution, they &s;ent him a deputation, informing him of the honours granted him, and the decree, which was drawn up in terms of the mo&s;t extravagant adulation. However, their flattery was far from &s;atisfy|ing his pride. He con&s;idered their conduct rather as a diminution of his power, than an addition to his glory. He therefore ordered
<PB N="179" REF="185">
them, on pain of death, not to concern them|&s;elves with his honours; and being met by their me&s;&s;engers on the way, who invited him to come and partake of the preparations which the &s;enate had decreed, he informed them that he would come; and then laying his hand upon his &s;word, added, that he would bring that al&s;o with him. In this manner, either quite omit|ting his triumph, or deferring it to another time, he entered the city only with an ovation: while the &s;enate pa&s;t the whole day in acclamati|ons in his prai&s;e, and &s;peeches filled with the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive flattery. This conduct in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erved to reconcile him, and &s;oon after their exce&s;&s;ive zeal in his cau&s;e entirely gained his favour. For it happened that Protogenes, who was one of the mo&s;t intimate and the mo&s;t cruel of his favourites, coming into the hou&s;e, was fawned upon by the whole body of the &s;enate, and particularly by Proculus. Whereupon Protogenes with a fierce look, a&s;ked how one who was &s;uch an enemy to the emperor could be &s;uch a friend to him? There needed no more to excite the &s;enate again&s;t Proculus. They in&s;tantly &s;eized upon him, and violently tore him in pieces; plainly &s;hewing by their conduct, that tyranny in the prince produces cruelty in tho&s;e whom he governs.</P>
<P>It was after returning from his extravagant expedition, that he was waited on by a depu|tation
<PB N="180" REF="186">
from the Jews of Alexandria, who came to deprecate his anger, for not wor&s;hipping his divinity as other nations had done. He was employed in looking over &s;ome hou&s;es of plea|&s;ure, and giving directions to the workmen, when Philo, the Jew, and the re&s;t of the em|ba&s;&s;y, were admitted to an audience. Upon their approaching him with the mo&s;t profound humility, he began by calling them enemies to the gods, and by a&s;king them how they could refu&s;e to acknowledge his divinity? Upon their replying that they had &s;acrificed hecatombs both upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the empire, and his recovery from &s;ickne&s;s, he replied, that tho&s;e &s;acrifices were offered not to him, but for him. In the mean time, while they continued &s;ilently a&s;toni&s;hed at his impiety, he went from room to room, giving directions to his workmen con|cerning new improvements, and remarking &s;uch parts of the furniture as happened to di&s;plea&s;e him. He would now and then &s;top to a&s;k &s;ome extravagant que&s;tion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What can be the rea&s;on," cried he, "that you Jews ab&s;tain from pork?"</Q>  This que&s;tion &s;eemed &s;o very lively to his attendants, that they bur&s;t into &s;uch loud fits of laughter, as obliged an officer who was pre&s;ent to reprimand them. Philo was will|ing to give him all the information he was able upon this head, and began by &s;aying, That different nations had different cu&s;toms;
<PB N="181" REF="187">
that, while the people of one religion ab&s;tained from pork, tho&s;e of another never eat lamb.  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor do I blame them," cried Caligula, "for lamb is very bad eating. But tell me," con|tinued he, "What preten&s;ions have you to be citizens of Alexandria?"</Q> Upon this, Philo began to enter into the bu&s;ine&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y; but he had &s;carce commenced, when Caligula abruptly left him, and ran into a large hall, the windows of which he ordered to be adorned with tran&s;parent &s;tone, which was u&s;ed by the antients in&s;tead of gla&s;s. He then returned to the deputies, and a&s;&s;uming a more moderate air, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well," cried he, "let me know what you have to &s;ay in your defence."</Q> Philo be|gan his harangue where it had been interrupted before; but Caligula again left him in the mid&s;t of it, and gave orders for placing &s;ome pictures. Nothing can be a more &s;triking picture than this, of the manner in which this mon&s;ter at|tended to the complaints of mankind. This affair of the Jews remained undecided during his reign; but it was at la&s;t &s;ettled by his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to their &s;atisfaction. It was upon this occa&s;ion, that Philo made the following re|markable an&s;wer to his a&s;&s;ociates, who were terrified with apprehen&s;ions from the emperor's indignation: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fear nothing," cried he to them; "Caligula, by declaring again&s;t us, puts God on our &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188">
The continuation of this horrid reign &s;eemed to threaten univer&s;al calamity: however, it was as &s;hort as it de&s;erved to be. There had already been &s;everal con&s;piracies formed to de|&s;troy the tyrant, but without &s;ucce&s;s. That which at la&s;t &s;ucceeded, in delivering the world of this mon&s;ter, was concerted under the influence of Ca&s;&s;ius Cherea, tribune of the Praetorian bands. This was a man of experienced courage, an ar|dent admirer of freedom, and con&s;equently an enemy to tyrants. Be&s;ides the motives which he had in common with other men, he had re|ceived repeated in&s;ults from Caligula, who took all occa&s;ions of turning him into ridicule, and impeaching him of cowardice, merely becau&s;e he happened to have an effeminate voice. When|ever Cherea came to demand the watch-word from the emperor, according to cu&s;tom, he always gave him either Venus, Adonis, or &s;ome &s;uch, implying effeminacy and &s;oftne&s;s. He, therefore, &s;ecretly imparted his de&s;igns to &s;everal &s;enators and knights, whom he knew to have received per&s;onal injuries from Cali|gula, or to be apprehen&s;ive of tho&s;e to come. Among the&s;e to Valerius A&s;iaticus, who&s;e wife the emperor had debauched. Annius Vinici|anus, who was &s;u&s;pected of having been in a former con&s;piracy, was now de&s;irous of really engaging in the fir&s;t de&s;ign that offered. Be&s;ides the&s;e, were Clemens, the prefect; and
<PB N="183" REF="189">
Cali&s;tus, who&s;e riches made him obnoxious to the tyrant's re&s;entment.</P>
<P>While the&s;e were deliberating upon the mo&s;t certain and &s;peedy method of de&s;troying the tyrant, an unexpected incident gave new &s;trength to the con&s;piracy. Pompedius, a &s;e|nator of di&s;tinction, having been accu&s;ed be|fore the emperor, of having &s;poken of him with di&s;re&s;pect, the informer cited one Quin|tilia, an actre&s;s, to confirm his accu&s;ation. Quintilia, however, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a degree of fortitude not ea&s;ily found, even in the other &s;ex. She denied the fact with ob&s;tinacy; and being put to the torture, at the informer's reque&s;t, &s;he bore the &s;evere&s;t torments of the rack with un&s;haken con&s;tancy. But what is mo&s;t remarkable of her re&s;olution is, that &s;he was acquainted with all the particulars of the con&s;piracy; and although Cherea was the per|&s;on appointed to pre&s;ide at her torture, &s;he re|vealed nothing: on the contrary, when &s;he was led to the rack, &s;he trod upon the toe of one of the con&s;pirators, intimating at once her knowledge of the confederacy, and her own re&s;olution not to divulge it. In this manner &s;he &s;uffered, until all her limbs were di&s;located, and in that deplorable &s;tate was pre&s;ented to the emperor, who ordered her a gratuity for what &s;he had &s;uffered. Cherea could now no
<PB N="184" REF="190">
longer contain his indignation, at being thus made the in&s;trument of a tyrant's cruelty. He, therefore, propo&s;ed to the con&s;pirators to at|tack him as he went to offer &s;acrifices in the Capitol; or while he was employed in the &s;e|cret plea&s;ures of his palace. The re&s;t, how|ever, were of opinion, that it was be&s;t to fall upon him when he &s;hould be unattended; by which means they would be more certain of their &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;everal deliberations, it was at la&s;t re&s;olved, to attack him during the con|tinuance of the Palatine games, which la&s;ted four days; and to &s;trike the blow, when his guards &s;hould have the lea&s;t opportunity to de|fend him. In con&s;equence of this, the three fir&s;t days of the games pa&s;&s;ed, without affording that opportunity which was &s;o ardently de&s;ired. Cherea now, therefore, began to apprehend, that deferring the time of the con&s;piracy, might be a means to divulge it: he even began to dread, that the honour of killing the tyrant, might fall to the lot of &s;ome other per&s;on, more bold than him&s;elf. Wherefore, he at la&s;t re&s;olved, to defer the execution of his plot only to the day following, when Caligula &s;hould pa&s;s through a private gallery, to &s;ome baths, not far di&s;tant from the palace.</P>
<P>The la&s;t day of the games was more &s;plendid than the re&s;t, and Caligula &s;eemed more &s;pright|ly
<PB N="185" REF="191">
and conde&s;cending than u&s;ual. He took great amu&s;ement in &s;eeing the people &s;cramble for the fruits, and other rarities, thrown, by his order, among them; and &s;eemed no way ap|prehen&s;ive of the plot formed for his de&s;truction. In the mean time, the con&s;piracy began to tran|&s;pire; and, had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any friends, it could not fail of being di&s;ccovered. A &s;enator, who was pre&s;ent, a&s;king one of his acquaintance, if he had heard any thing new; the other reply|ing in the negative; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then you mu&s;t know," &s;ays he, "that this day will be repre&s;ented the death of a tyrant."</Q> The other immediately under|&s;tood him, but de&s;ired him to be more cautious how he divulged a &s;ecret of &s;o much importance. The con&s;pirators waited a great part of the day with the mo&s;t extreme anxiety; and at one time Caligula &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;pend the whole day without any refre&s;hment. This unex|pected delay entirely exa&s;perated Cherea; and had he not been re&s;trained, he would have gone and perpetrated his de&s;ign in the mid&s;t of all the people. Ju&s;t at that in&s;tant, while he was yet he&s;itating what he &s;hould do, A&s;prenas, one of the con&s;pirators, per&s;uaded Caligula to go to the bath, and take &s;ome &s;light refre&s;h|ment, in order to enjoy the re&s;t of the enter|tainment with greater reli&s;h. The emperor, therefore, ri&s;ing up, the con&s;pirators u&s;ed every
<PB N="186" REF="192">
precaution to keep off the throng, and to &s;ur|round him, under pretence of greater a&s;&s;iduity. Upon entering into the little vaulted gallery that led to the bath, he was met by a band of Grecian children, who had been in&s;tructed in &s;inging, and were come to perform in his pre|&s;ence. He was once more, therefore, going to return into the theatre with them, had not the leader of the band excu&s;ed him&s;elf, as having a cold. This was the moment which Cherea &s;eized to &s;trike him to the ground; crying out, "Tyrant, think upon this." Immediately after the other con&s;pirators ru&s;hed in; and, while the emperor continued to re&s;i&s;t, crying out, that he was not yet dead, they di&s;patched him with thirty wounds.</P>
<P>Such was the merited death of Caius Cali|gula, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, after a &s;hort reign of three years, ten months and eight days. It will be unnece&s;&s;ary to add any thing more to his character, than what Seneca &s;ays of him: namely, that nature &s;eemed to have brought him forth, to &s;hew what was po&s;&s;ible to be produced, from the greate&s;t vice, &s;upported by the greate&s;t authority. His wit and eloquence are applauded by &s;ome: but what could be his ta&s;te in either, who con|demned Virgil as a bad poet, and Livy as a wretched hi&s;torian? With him his wife and
<PB N="187" REF="193">
infant daughter al&s;o peri&s;hed; the one being &s;tabbed by a centurion, the other having its brains da&s;hed out again&s;t the wall. His mo|ney al&s;o was melted down, by a decree of the &s;enate; and &s;uch precautions were taken, that all &s;eemed willing, that neither his features nor his name might be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.  CLAUDIUS, the Fifth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="794" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="42" UNIT="A.D."> AS &s;oon as the death of Caligula was made public, it produced the greate&s;t confu&s;ion in all parts of the city. The con&s;pirators, who only aimed at de&s;troying a tyrant, without at|tending to a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, had all &s;ought &s;afety, by retiring to private places. Some thought the report of the emperor's death, was only an artifice of his own, to &s;ee how his enemies would behave. Others averred, that he was &s;till alive, and actually in a fair way to reco|ver. In this interval of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the German guards finding it a convenient time to pillage, gave a loo&s;e to their licentiou&s;ne&s;s, under a pretence of revenging the emperor's death. All the con&s;pirators and &s;enators that fell in their way, received no mercy: A&s;pre|nas, Norbanus and Anteius were cut in pieces. However, their rage being, at length, with|out an object, and their &s;ervice without a ma&s;|ter, they grew calm by degrees, and the &s;enate was permitted to a&s;&s;emble, in order to delibe|berate
<PB N="189" REF="195">
berate upon what was nece&s;&s;ary to be done in the pre&s;ent emergency.</P>
<P>In this deliberation, Saturninus, who was then con&s;ul, in&s;i&s;ted much upon the benefits of liberty, and talked in raptures of Cherea's fortitude, alledging that it de&s;erved the highe&s;t reward. This was a language highly plea&s;ing to the &s;enate, who being long harra&s;&s;ed by the cruelty of tyrants, panted once more for the re&s;toration of their former freedom. Liberty now became the favourite topic; and they even ventured to talk of extingui&s;hing the very name of Cae&s;ar. Impre&s;&s;ed with this generous re&s;o|lution, they brought over &s;ome cohorts of the city to their &s;ide, and boldly &s;eized upon the Capitol. But it was now too late for Rome to regain her pri&s;tine freedom, the populace and the army oppo&s;ed their endeavours. The for|mer were &s;till mindful of their ancient hatred to the &s;enate, and remembered the donations and public &s;pectacles of the emperors with regret. The latter were &s;en&s;ible they could have no power but in a monarchy; and had &s;ome hopes that the election of the emperor would fall to their determination. In this oppo&s;ition of in|tere&s;t, and variety of opinions, chance &s;eemed at la&s;t to decide the fate of the empire. Some &s;oldiers happening to run about the palace, di&s;|covered Claudius, Caligula's uncle, lurking in a &s;ecret place, where he had hid him&s;elf through
<PB N="190" REF="196">
fear. Of this per&s;onage, who had hitherto been de&s;pi&s;ed for his imbecility, they re&s;olved to make an emperor; and accordingly carried him upon their &s;houlders to the camp, where they proclaimed him, at a time he expected no|thing but death.</P>
<P>The &s;enate now, therefore, perceiving that force alone was likely to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were re&s;olved to &s;ubmit, &s;ince they had no power to oppo&s;e. Claudius was the per&s;on mo&s;t nearly allied to the late emperor, then living, being the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of Caligula. The &s;enate, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed a decree, confirming him in the empire; and went &s;oon after in a body, to render him their compul&s;ive homage. Cherea was the fir&s;t who fell a &s;acrifice to the jealou&s;y of this new mo|narch. He met death with all the fortitude of an ancient Roman, de&s;iring to die by the &s;ame &s;word with which he had killed Caligula. Lupus, his friend, was put to death with him, and Sabinus, one of the con&s;pirators, laid vio|lent hands on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Claudius was now fifty years old, when he began to reign. The complicated di&s;ea&s;es of his infancy, had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, affected all the faculties both of his body and mind. He was continued in a &s;tate of pupilage much longer than was u&s;ual at that time; and &s;eemed, in every part of life, incapable of conducting
<PB REF="197">
him&s;elf. Not that he was entirely de&s;titute of under&s;tanding, &s;ince he had made a tolerable proficiency in the Greek and Latin languages, and even wrote an hi&s;tory of his own time; which, however de&s;titute of other merit, was not contemptible in point of &s;tyle. Never|thele&s;s, with this &s;hare of erudition, he was un|able to advance him&s;elf in the &s;tate, and &s;eemed utterly neglected, till he was placed all at once at the head of affairs.</P>
<P>The commencement of his reign, as it was with all the other bad emperors, gave the mo&s;t promi&s;ing hopes of an happy continuance. He begun by pa&s;&s;ing an act of oblivion for all for|mer words and actions, and di&s;annulled all the cruel edicts of Caligula. He &s;hewed him&s;elf more moderate than his predece&s;&s;ors with re|gard to titles and honours. He forbade all per|&s;ons, upon &s;evere penalties, to &s;acrifice to him, as they had done to Caligula. He was a&s;&s;idu|ous in hearing and examining complaints; and frequently admini&s;tered ju&s;tice in per&s;on; tem|pering, by his mildne&s;s, the &s;everity of &s;trict ju&s;tice. We are told of his bringing a woman to acknowledge her &s;on, by adjudging her to marry him. The tribunes of the people coming one day to attend him, when he was on his tribunal, he courteou&s;ly excu&s;ed him&s;elf, for not having room for them to &s;it down. By this deportment he &s;o much gained the affections of
<PB REF="198">
the people, that upon a vague report of his being &s;lain by &s;urpri&s;e, they ran about the &s;treets, in the utmo&s;t rage and con&s;ternation, with horrid imprecations again&s;t all &s;uch as were acce&s;&s;ary to his death; nor could they be appea&s;ed, till they were a&s;&s;ured, with certainty, of his &s;afety. He took a more than ordinary care that Rome &s;hould be continually &s;upplied with corn and provi&s;ions, &s;ecuring the mer|chants again&s;t pirates. He was not le&s;s a&s;&s;idu|ous in his buildings, in which he excelled almo&s;t all that went before him. He con&s;tructed a won|derful aquaeduct, called after his own name, much &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any other in Rome, either for workman&s;hip, or plentiful &s;upply. It brought water from forty miles di&s;tance, through great mountains, and over deep vallies, being built on &s;tately arches, and furni&s;hing the highe&s;t parts of the city. He made al&s;o an haven at O&s;tia; a work of &s;uch immen&s;e expence, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were unable to maintain it. But his greate&s;t work of all was, the draining the lake Fucinus, which was the large&s;t in Italy, and bringing its water into the Tyber, in order to &s;trengthen the current of that river. For effecting this, among other va&s;t difficulties, he mined through a mountain of &s;tone, three miles broad, and kept thirty thou|&s;and men employed for eleven years together.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199">
To this &s;olicitude for the internal advantages of the &s;tate, he added that of a watchful guar|dian&s;hip over the provinces. He re&s;tored Judea to Herod Agrippa, which Caligula had taken from Herod Antipas, his uncle, the man who had put John the Bapti&s;t to death, and who was bani&s;hed by order of the pre&s;ent emperor. Claudius al&s;o re&s;tored &s;uch princes to their kingdoms, as had been unju&s;tly di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors; but deprived the Lycians and Rhodians of their liberty, for hav|ing promoted in&s;urrections, and crucified &s;ome citizens of Rome.</P>
<P>He even undertook to gratify the people by foreign conque&s;t. The Britons, who had, for near an hundred years, been left in &s;ole po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own i&s;land, began to &s;eek the mediation of Rome, to quell their inte&s;tine commotions. The principal man, who de&s;ired to &s;ubject his native country to the Roman do|minion, was one Bericus, who, by many ar|guments, per&s;uaded the emperor to make a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land, magnifying the advan|tages that would attend the conque&s;t of it. In pur&s;uance of his advice, therefore, Plautius, the praetor, was ordered to pa&s;s over into Gaul, and make preparations for this great expedition. At fir&s;t, indeed, his &s;oldiers &s;eemed backward to embark, declaring that they were unwilling to make war beyond the limits of the world,
<PB N="194" REF="200">
for &s;o they judged Britain to be. However, they were at la&s;t per&s;uaded to go; and the Britons, under the conduct of their king Cyno|belinus, were &s;everal times overthrown.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="A.D."> The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;oon after induced Claudius to go into Britain in per&s;on, upon pretence that the natives were &s;till &s;editious, and had not de|livered up &s;ome Roman fugitives, who had taken &s;helter among them. However, his ex|pedition rather &s;eemed calculated for &s;hew than &s;ervice; the time he continued in Britain, which was in all but &s;ixteen days, was more taken up in receiving homage, than extending his con|que&s;ts. Great rejoicings were made upon his return to Rome: the &s;enate decreed him a &s;plendid triumph, triumphal arches were erect|ed in his honour, and annual games in&s;tituted to commemorate his victories. In the mean time, the war was vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted by Plautius and his lieutenant Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who, ac|cording to Suetonius, fought thirty battles with the enemy, and by that means reduced a part of the i&s;land into the form of a Roman province. However, this war broke out afre&s;h under the <MILESTONE N="51" UNIT="A.D."> government of O&s;torius, who &s;ucceeded Plau|tius. The Britons either de&s;pi&s;ing him for want of experience, or hoping to gain advan|tages over a per&s;on newly come to command, ro&s;e up in arms, and di&s;claimed the Roman power. The Iceni, the Cangi, and the Brigantes
<PB N="195" REF="201">
made a powerful re&s;i&s;tance, though they were at length overcome; but the Silures, or inha|bitants of South Wales, under their king Ca|ractacus, were the mo&s;t formidable opponents the Roman generals had ever yet encountered. This brave barbarian not only made a gallant defence, but often &s;eemed to claim a doubtful victory. He, with great conduct, removed the &s;eat of war into the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the country, and for nine years kept the Romans in continual alarm.</P>
<P>This general, however, upon the approach of O&s;torius, finding him&s;elf obliged to come to a deci&s;ive engagement, addre&s;&s;ed his coun|trymen with calm re&s;olution; telling them, that this battle would either e&s;tabli&s;h their li|berty, or confirm their &s;ervitude: that they ought to remember the bravery of their an|ce&s;tors, by who&s;e valour they were delivered from taxes and tributes, and that this was the time to &s;hew them&s;elves equal to their proge|nitors. Nothing, however, that undi&s;ciplined valour could perform, could avail again&s;t the conduct of the Roman legions. After an ob&s;ti|nate fight, the Britons were entirely routed; the wife and daughter of Caractacus were taken pri&s;oners; and he him&s;elf &s;eeking refuge from Carti&s;mandua, queen of the Brigantes, was treacherou&s;ly delivered up to the conquerors. When he was brought to Rome, nothing could exceed the curio&s;ity of the people, to
<PB N="196" REF="202">
behold a man who had, for &s;o many years, braved the power of the empire. On his part, he te&s;tified no marks of ba&s;e dejection; but, as he was leading through the &s;treets, happening to ob&s;erve the &s;plendour of every object around him; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas," cried he, "how is it po&s;&s;ible, that people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch magnificence at home, could think of envying Caractacus an humble cottage in Britain!"</Q> When he was brought before the emperor, while the other captives &s;ued for pity, with the mo&s;t ab|ject lamentations, Caractacus &s;tood before the tribunal with an intrepid air, and &s;eemed rather willing to accept of pardon, than meanly &s;oli|citous of &s;uing for it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If," cried he, to|wards the end of his &s;peech, "I had yielded immediately, and without oppo&s;ition, nei|ther my fortune would have been remark|able, nor your glory memorable: you would have cea&s;ed to be victorious, and I had been forgotten. If now, therefore, you &s;pare my life, I &s;hall continue a perpetual example of your clemency."</Q> Claudius had the genero&s;ity to pardon him, and O&s;torius was decreed a triumph, which, however, he did not live to enjoy. Though the Britons were thus humbled, they were by no means en|tirely &s;ubdued: &s;everal new revolts en&s;ued; but the natives being weakened by di&s;&s;en|&s;ions among&s;t each other, were many times
<PB N="197" REF="203">
overthrown, and more ea&s;ily kept under. The&s;e tran&s;actions in Britain continued during the whole reign of Claudius: his fir&s;t expedition into Britain was in the &s;econd year of his reign, and the victory over Caractacus in the tenth. I have thrown them, however, into one point of view, to avoid interrupting the narrative.</P>
<P>Claudius, as I have &s;aid, gave, in the be|ginning of his reign, the highe&s;t hopes of an happy continuance; but he &s;oon began to le&s;&s;en his care for the public, and to commit to his favourites all the concerns of the empire. This weak prince had from his infancy been in a &s;tate of pupilage; and now, when called to go|vern, he was unable to act, but under the di|rection of others. Men of narrow capacities, and feeble minds, are only good or evil, as they happen to fall into the hands of virtuous or vicious guides; and, unhappily for him, his directors, were, to the la&s;t degree, abandoned and infamous. The chief of the&s;e, was his wife, Me&s;&s;alina, who&s;e name is almo&s;t become a common appellation to women of abandoned characters. However, &s;he was not le&s;s re|markable for her cruelties than her lu&s;ts, as by her intrigues &s;he de&s;troyed many of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families of Rome. Subordinate to her were the emperor's freedmen; Pallas, the trea&s;urer; Narci&s;&s;us, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and Calli&s;tus, the ma&s;ter of the reque&s;ts. The&s;e
<PB N="198" REF="204">
entirely governed Claudius, &s;o that he was only left the fatigues of ceremony, while they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the power of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to enumerate the various cruelties which the&s;e in&s;idious advi&s;ers obliged the feeble emperor to commit: tho&s;e again&s;t his own family will &s;uffice. Appius Silanus, a per&s;on of great merit, who had been married to the emperor's mother-in-law, was put to death upon the &s;ugge&s;tions of Me&s;&s;alina. After him he &s;lew both his &s;ons-in-law, Silanus and Pompey, and his two nieces, the Livias, one the daughter of Dru&s;us, the other of Germa|nicus; and all without permitting them to plead in their defence, or even without a&s;&s;igning any cau&s;e for his di&s;plea&s;ure. Great numbers of others fell a &s;acrifice to the jealou&s;y of Me&s;&s;a|lina and her minions, who bore &s;o great a &s;way in the &s;tate, that all offices, dignities and go|vernments, were entirely at their di&s;po&s;al. Every thing was put to &s;ale: they took money for pardons and penalties; and accumulated, by the&s;e means, &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums, that the wealth of Cra&s;&s;us was con&s;idered as nothing in compari&s;on. One day, the emperor complaining that his ex|chequer was exhau&s;ted, he was ludicrou&s;ly told, that it might be &s;ufficiently repleni&s;hed, if his two freedmen would take him into partner&s;hip. Still, however, during &s;uch immen&s;e &s;trides of
<PB N="199" REF="205">
corruption, he regarded his favourites with the highe&s;t e&s;teem, and even &s;olicited the &s;enate to grant them peculiar marks of their approbation. The&s;e di&s;orders in the mini&s;ters of government did not fail to produce con&s;piracies again&s;t the emperor. Statius Corvinus and Gallus A&s;&s;i|nius formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t him. Two knights, who&s;e names are not told us, privately combined to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. But the revolt which gave him the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, and which was puni&s;hed with the mo&s;t unrelenting &s;everity, was that of Camillus, his lieutenant|governor in Dalmatia. This general, incited by many of the principal men of Rome, openly rebelled again&s;t him, and a&s;&s;umed the title of emperor. Nothing could exceed the terrors of Claudius, upon being informed of this revolt: his nature and his crimes had di&s;po&s;ed him to be more cowardly than the re&s;t of mankind; &s;o that when Camillus commanded him by his letters to relinqui&s;h the empire, and retire to a private &s;tation, he &s;eemed inclined to obey. However, his fears upon this account were &s;oon removed; for the legions which had declared for Camillus being terrified by &s;ome remark|able prodigies, &s;hortly after abandoned him; &s;o that the man whom but five days before they had acknowledged as emperor, they now thought it no in&s;amy to de&s;troy. The cruelty of Me&s;&s;alina and her minions upon this occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="200" REF="206">
&s;eemed to have no bounds. They &s;o wrought upon the emperor's fears and &s;u&s;pi|cions, that numbers were executed without tryal or proof; and &s;carce any, even of tho&s;e who were but &s;u&s;pected, e&s;caped, unle&s;s by ran&s;oming their lives with their fortunes.</P>
<P>Among the numbers who were put to death on this occa&s;ion, I can't omit mentioning the pathetic cata&s;trophe of Petus and his faithful wife Arria. Cecina Petus was one of tho&s;e un|fortunate men, who joined with Camillus again&s;t the emperor, and who, when his a&s;&s;ociate was &s;lain by the army, had endeavoured to e&s;cape into Dalmatia. However, he was there appre|hended, and put on board a &s;hip in order to be conveyed to Rome. Arria, who had been long the partner of his affection and misfortunes, en|treated his keepers to be taken in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el with her hu&s;band. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is u&s;ual," &s;he &s;aid, "to grant a man of his quality a few &s;laves, to dre&s;s, un|dre&s;s, and attend him; I my&s;elf will perform all the&s;e offices, and &s;ave you the trouble of a more numerous retinue."</Q> Her fidelity, how|ever, could not prevail. She therefore hired a fi&s;herman's bark, and thus kept company with the &s;hip in which her hu&s;band was conveyed through the voyage. They had an only &s;on, equally remarkable for the beauty of his per|&s;on, and the rectitude of his di&s;po&s;ition. This youth died at the time his father was confined
<PB N="201" REF="207">
to his bed by a dangerous di&s;order. However, the affectionate Arria concealed her &s;on's death, and in her vi&s;its to her hu&s;band te&s;tified no marks of &s;adne&s;s. Being a&s;ked how her &s;on did, &s;he replied that he was at re&s;t, and only left her hu&s;band's chamber to give a vent to her tears. When Petus was condemned to die, and the orders were that he &s;hould put an end to his own life, Arria u&s;ed every art to in&s;pire him with re&s;olution; and at length, finding him continue timid and wavering, &s;he took the poniard, and &s;tabbing her&s;elf in his pre|&s;ence, pre&s;ented it to him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It gives me no pain, my Petus."</Q></P>
<P>By &s;uch cruelties as the&s;e, the favourites of the emperor endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his and their own authority: but in order to encrea&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they laboured to augment the greatne&s;s of his terrors. He now became a prey to jealou&s;y and di&s;quietude. Being one day in the temple, and finding a &s;word that was left there by accident, he con|vened the &s;enate in a fright, and informed them of his danger. After this he never ventured to go to any fea&s;t without being &s;urrounded by his guards, nor would he &s;uffer any man to ap|proach him without a previous &s;earch. Thus wholly employed by his anxiety for &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, he entirely left the care of the &s;tate to his favourites, who by degrees gave him a re|li&s;h
<PB N="202" REF="208">
for &s;laughter. From this time, he &s;eemed delighted with inflicting tortures, and on a certain occa&s;ion continued a whole day at the city Tibur, waiting for an hangman from Rome, that he might fea&s;t his eyes with an execution in the manner of the ancients. Nor was he le&s;s regardle&s;s of the per&s;ons he con|demned, than cruel in the infliction of their puni&s;hment. Such was his extreme &s;tupidity, that he would frequently invite tho&s;e to &s;upper whom he had put to death but the day before; and often denied the having given orders for an execution, but a few hours after pronouncing &s;entence. Suetonius a&s;&s;ures us, that there were no le&s;s than thirty-five &s;enators, and above three hundred knights, executed in his reign; and that &s;uch was his unconcern in the mid&s;t of &s;laugh|ter, that one of his tribunes bringing him an account of a certain &s;enator who was executed, he quite forgot his offence, but calmly acqui|e&s;ced in his puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>In this manner was Claudius urged on by Me&s;&s;alina to commit cruelties, which he con|&s;idered only as whole&s;ome &s;everities, while in the mean time, &s;he put no bounds to her enor|mities. The impunity of her pa&s;t vices only encrea&s;ing her confidence to commit new, her debaucheries now became every day more noto|rious, and her lewdne&s;s exceeded what had ever been &s;een in Rome. She cho&s;e her paramours
<PB N="203" REF="209">
through wantonne&s;s, and then, &s;acrificed them through caprice. She cau&s;ed &s;ome women of the fir&s;t quality to commit adultery in the pre|&s;ence of their hu&s;bands, and de&s;troyed &s;uch as refu&s;ed to comply. After appearing for &s;ome years in&s;atiable in her de&s;ires, &s;he at length fixed her affections upon Caius Silius, the mo&s;t beautiful youth in Rome. As all her pa&s;&s;ions were in extreme, her love for this young Ro|man &s;eemed to amount even to madne&s;s. She obliged him to divorce his wife Junia Syllana, that &s;he might entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s him to her&s;elf. She obliged him to accept of immen&s;e trea|&s;ures, and valuable pre&s;ents, cohabiting with him in the mo&s;t open manner, and treating him with the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s familiarity. The very imperial ornaments were transferred to his hou&s;e, and the emperor's &s;laves and attendants had orders to wait upon the adulterer. Nothing was wanting to complete the in&s;olence of their conduct, but their being married together, and that was &s;oon after effected. They relied upon the emperor's imbecillity for &s;ecurity, and only waited till he retired to O&s;tia to put their ill|judged project into execution. In his ab&s;ence they celebrated their nuptials with all the cere|monies and &s;plendour which attend the mo&s;t confident &s;ecurity. Me&s;&s;alina giving a loo&s;e to her pa&s;&s;ion, appeared as a Bacchanalian with a thyr&s;us in her hand; while Silius a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="204" REF="210">
the character of Bacchus, his body being adorn|ed with robes imitating ivy, and his legs cover|ed with bu&s;kins. A troop of &s;ingers and dan|cers attended, who heightened the revel with the mo&s;t la&s;civious &s;ongs, and the mo&s;t inde|cent attitudes. In the mid&s;t of this riot, one Valens, a buffoon, is &s;aid to have climbed a tree; and being demanded what he &s;aw, an&s;wer|ed that he perceived a dreadful &s;torm coming from O&s;tia. What this fellow &s;poke at random, was actually at that time in preparation. It &s;eems that &s;ome time before, as the friend&s;hips of the vicious are always of &s;hort duration, there had been a quarrel between Me&s;&s;alina and Nar|ci&s;&s;us, the emperor's fir&s;t freed-man. This &s;ubtle mini&s;ter, therefore, de&s;ired nothing more than an opportunity of ruining the empre&s;s, and he judged this to be a mo&s;t favourable occa&s;ion. He fir&s;t made the di&s;covery, by means of two concubines who attended the emperor, who were in&s;tructed to inform him of Me&s;&s;alina's marriage, as the news of the day, while Nar|ci&s;&s;us him&s;elf &s;tept in to confirm their infor|mation. Finding that it operated upon the emperor's fears as he could wi&s;h, he re&s;olved to alarm him &s;till more by a di&s;covery of all Me&s;|&s;alina's projects and attempts. He aggravated the danger, and urged the expediency of &s;peed|ily puni&s;hing the delinquents. Claudius, quite terrified at &s;o unexpected a relation, &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="205" REF="211">
that the enemy was already at his gates, and frequently interrupted his freedmen, by a&s;king if he was &s;till ma&s;ter of the empire. Being a&s;|&s;ured that he yet had it in his power to conti|nue &s;o, he re&s;olved to go and puni&s;h the affront offered to his dignity without delay. Nothing could exceed the con&s;ternation of Me&s;&s;alina and her thoughtle&s;s companions, upon being in|formed that the emperor was coming to di&s;turb their fe&s;tivity. Every one retired in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Silius was taken. Me&s;&s;alina took &s;helter in &s;ome gardens formerly belonging to Lucullus, but which &s;he had lately &s;eized upon, having expelled A&s;iaticus the true owner, and put him to death. From thence &s;he &s;ent Bri|tannicus, her only &s;on by the emperor, with Octavia her daughter, to intercede for her, and implore his mercy. She &s;oon after followed them her&s;elf: but Narci&s;&s;us had &s;o fortified the emperor again&s;t her arts, and contrived &s;uch methods of diverting his attention from her defence, that &s;he was obliged to retire in de|&s;pair. Narci&s;&s;us being thus far &s;ucce&s;sful, led Claudius to the hou&s;e of the adulterer, there &s;hewed him the apartments adorned with the &s;poils of his own palace; and then conducting him to the Praetorian camp, revived his courage by giving him a&s;&s;urances of the readine&s;s of the &s;oldiers to defend him. Having thus artfully wrought upon his fears and re&s;entment, the
<PB N="206" REF="212">
wretched Silius was commanded to appear, who making no defence, was in&s;tantly put to death in the emperor's pre&s;ence. Several others &s;hared the &s;ame fate, but Me&s;&s;alina &s;till flat|tered her&s;elf with hopes of pardon. She re|&s;olved to leave neither prayers nor tears unat|tempted to appea&s;e the emperor. She &s;ome|times even gave a loo&s;e to her re&s;entment, and threatened her accu&s;ers with vengeance. Nor did &s;he want ground for entertaining the mo&s;t favourable expectations. Claudius hav|ing returned from the execution of her para|mours, and having allayed his re&s;entment in a banquet, began to relent. He now there|fore commanded his attendants to apprize that mi&s;erable creature, meaning Me&s;&s;alina, of his re&s;olution to hear her accu&s;ation the next day, and ordered her to be in readine&s;s with her de|fence. The permi&s;&s;ion to defend her&s;elf would have been fatal to Narci&s;&s;us, wherefore he ru&s;hed out, and ordered the tribunes and cen|turions who were in readine&s;s, to execute her immediately by the emperor's command. Upon their arrival at the gardens, where &s;he &s;till con|tinued, they found her &s;tretched upon the ground, attended by her mother Lepida, who exhorted her to prevent her puni&s;hment by a voluntary death. But this unfortunate woman was too much &s;oftened by luxury, to be able to face death without terror. In&s;tead of for|tifying
<PB N="207" REF="213">
her re&s;olution to meet the blow, &s;he only gave way to tears and unpitied di&s;tre&s;s. At length, taking a &s;word from one of the &s;oldiers, &s;he put it to her brea&s;t; but her fears &s;till pro|longing the blow, the tribune ran her through the body, and &s;o di&s;patched her. Claudius was immediately informed of her death, in the mid&s;t of his banquet; but this in&s;en&s;ible ideot &s;hewed not the lea&s;t appearance of emotion. He continued at table with his u&s;ual tranquil|lity, while neither the love he bore her, the joy of her accu&s;ers, nor the &s;orrow of his chil|dren, had the lea&s;t effect upon his temper. As a proof, however, that this proceeded rather from &s;tupidity than fortitude, the day follow|ing, while he was &s;itting at table, he a&s;ked why Me&s;&s;alina was ab&s;ent, as if he had totally for|gotten her crimes and her puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Claudius being now a widower, declared publickly, that as he had been hitherto unfortu|nate in his marriages, he would remain &s;ingle for the future, and that he would be contented to forfeit his life, in ca&s;e he broke his re&s;olu|tion. However, the re&s;olutions of Claudius were but of &s;hort continuance. Having been accu&s;tomed to live under the controul of wo|men, his pre&s;ent freedom was become irk&s;ome to him, and he was entirely unable to live with|out a director. His freedmen therefore per|ceiving his inclinations, re&s;olved to procure him
<PB N="208" REF="214">
another wife; and, after &s;ome deliberation, they fixed upon Agrippina, the daughter of his brother Germanicus. This woman was more practi&s;ed in vice than even the former empre&s;s. Her cruelties were more dangerous, as they were directed with greater caution: &s;he had poi&s;oned her former hu&s;band, to be at liberty to attend the calls of ambition; and, perfectly acquainted with all the infirmities of Claudius, only made u&s;e of his power to advance her own. However, as the late declaration of Claudius &s;eemed to be an ob&s;tacle to his mar|rying again, per&s;ons were &s;uborned to move in the &s;enate, that he &s;hould be compelled to take a wife, as a matter of great importance to the commonwealth; and &s;ome more deter|mined flatterers than the re&s;t, left the hou&s;e, as with a thorough re&s;olution, that in&s;tant, to con|&s;train him. When this decree (by which al&s;o ince&s;tuous marriages were made lawful) pa&s;t in the &s;enate, Claudius had &s;carce patience to contain him&s;elf a day before the celebration of his nuptials. However, &s;uch was the dete&s;|tation in which the people in general held the&s;e ince&s;tuous matches, that, tho' they were made lawful, yet only one of his tribunes, and one of his freedmen were found ba&s;e enough to follow his example.</P>
<P>Claudius having now received a new director, &s;ubmitted with more implicit obedience than
<PB N="209" REF="215">
in any former part of his reign. Agrippina's chief aims were to gain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in favour of her own &s;on Nero, and to &s;et a&s;ide the claims of young Britannicus, &s;on to the emperor and Me&s;&s;alina. For this purpo&s;e &s;he married Nero to the emperor's daughter Octavia, a few days after her own marriage. Not long after this, &s;he urged the emperor to &s;trengthen the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, in imitation of his predece&s;&s;ors, by making a new adoption, and advi&s;ed him to take in her &s;on Nero, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to divide the fatigues of government. The feeble prince, who had no di&s;cernment nor malice but what were infu&s;ed into him, imme|diately yielded to her per&s;ua&s;ions, and adopt|ed Nero in preference of his only &s;on Britanni|cus. Her next care was to encrea&s;e her &s;on's popularity, by giving him Seneca for a tutor. This excellent man, by birth a Spaniard, had been bani&s;hed into the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica by Claudius, upon the fal&s;e te&s;timony of Me&s;&s;a|lina, who had accu&s;ed him of adultery with Julia, the emperor's niece. The people loved and admired him for his genius, but &s;till more for his &s;trict morality; and a part of his re|putation therefore nece&s;&s;arily devolved to his pupil. This &s;ubtle woman was not le&s;s a&s;&s;i|duous in pretending the utmo&s;t affection for Britannicus; whom, however, &s;he re&s;olved at a proper time to de&s;troy; but her jealou&s;y
<PB N="210" REF="216">
was not confined to this child only; &s;he, &s;hortly after her acce&s;&s;ion, procured the deaths of &s;e|veral ladies who had been her rivals in the em|peror's affections. She di&s;placed the captains of the guard, and appointed Burrhus to that command; a per&s;on of great military know|ledge, <MILESTONE N="790" UNIT="U. C."> and &s;trongly attached to her intere&s;ts. <MILESTONE N="52" UNIT="A.D."> From that time, &s;he took le&s;s pains to di&s;|gui&s;e her power, and frequently entered the Capitol in a chariot; a privilege which none before were allowed, except of the &s;acerdotal order.</P>
<P>In the twelfth year of this monarch's reign, &s;he per&s;uaded him to re&s;tore liberty to the Rho|dians, of which he had deprived them &s;ome years before; and to remit the taxes of the city Ilium, as having been the progenitors of Rome. Her de&s;ign in this was to encrea&s;e the popu|larity of Nero, who pleaded the cau&s;e of both cities with great approbation. Thus did this ambitious woman take every &s;tep to aggrandize her &s;on, and was even contented to become hateful her&s;elf to the public, merely to en|crea&s;e his popularity. Being one day told by an a&s;trologer, that he would be em|peror, and yet the cau&s;e of her death;  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let him kill me," an&s;wered &s;he, "provided he but reigns."</Q> <HI>Occidet dum imperat.</HI></P>
<P>Such a very immoderate abu&s;e of her power, &s;erved at la&s;t to awaken the emperor's &s;u&s;picions.
<PB N="211" REF="217">
Agrippina's imperious temper began to grow in&s;upportable to him; and he was heard to de|clare, when heated with wine, that it was his fate to &s;uffer the di&s;orders of his wives, and to be their executioner. This expre&s;&s;ion &s;unk deep on her mind, and engaged all her facul|ties to prevent the blow. Her fir&s;t care was to remove Narci&s;&s;us, whom &s;he hated upon many accounts, but particularly for his at|tachment to Claudius. This mini&s;ter, for &s;ome time, oppo&s;ed her de&s;igns; but at length thought fit to retire by a voluntary exile into Campania. The unhappy emperor, thus ex|po&s;ed to all the machinations of his in&s;idious con&s;ort, &s;eemed entirely regardle&s;s of the dan|gers that threatened his de&s;truction. His af|fections for Britannicus were perceived every day to encrea&s;e, and &s;erved al&s;o to encrea&s;e the vigilance of Agrippina, and add &s;tings to her jealou&s;y. She now, therefore, re&s;olved not to defer a crime which &s;he had meditated a long while before; namely, that of poi&s;on|ing her hu&s;band. She for &s;ome time, how|ever, debated with her&s;elf in what manner &s;he &s;hould admini&s;ter the poi&s;on; as &s;he feared too &s;trong a do&s;e would di&s;cover her treach|ery, and one too weak might fail of its effect. At length &s;he determined upon a poi&s;on of &s;in|gular efficacy to de&s;troy his intellects, and yet not &s;uddenly to terminate his life. As &s;he had
<PB N="212" REF="218">
been long conver&s;ant in this horrid practice, &s;he applied to a woman called Locu&s;ta, noto|rious for a&s;&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The poi|&s;on was given the emperor among mu&s;hrooms, a di&s;h he was particularly fond of. Shortly after having eaten, he dropped down in&s;en&s;ible; but this cau&s;ed no alarm, as it was u&s;ual with him to &s;it eating till he had &s;tupified all his faculties, and was obliged to be carried off to his bed from the table. However, his con&s;titution &s;eemed to overcome the effects of the potion, when Agrippina re&s;olved to make &s;ure of him; wherefore &s;he directed a wretched phy&s;ician, who was her creature, to thru&s;t a poi&s;oned feather down his throat, under pretence of making him vomit, and this di&s;|patched him.</P>
<P>The reign of this emperor, feeble and im|potent as he was, produced no great calamities in the &s;tate, &s;ince his cruelties were chiefly le|velled at tho&s;e about his per&s;on. The li&s;t of the inhabitants of Rome at this time amounted to &s;ix million eight-hundred and forty-four thou|&s;and &s;ouls; a number equal perhaps to all the people of England at this day. In &s;uch a con|cour&s;e, it is not to be doubted but every virtue and every vice mu&s;t come to their highe&s;t pitch of refinement; and, in fact, the conduct of Seneca &s;eems an in&s;tance of the former, and that of Me&s;&s;alina of the latter. However, the
<PB N="213" REF="219">
general character of the times was that of cor|ruption and luxury; for wherever there is a great &s;uperfluity of wealth, there will al&s;o be &s;een a thou&s;and vicious modes of exhau&s;ting it. The military &s;pirit of Rome, tho' much relaxed from its former &s;everity, &s;till continued to awe mankind; and tho' during this reign, the world might be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be without a head, yet the terror of the Roman name alone kept mankind in their obedience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.  NERO, the Sixth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="55" UNIT="A.D."> CLAUDIUS being de&s;troyed, Agrip|pina took every precaution to conceal his death from the public, until &s;he had &s;ettled her mea|&s;ures for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A &s;trong guard was placed at all the avenues of the pa|lace, while &s;he amu&s;ed the people with various reports; at one time giving out that he was &s;till alive; at another, that he was recovering. In the mean while, &s;he made &s;ure of the per&s;on of young Britannicus, under a pretence of af|fection for him. Like one overcome with the extremity of her grief, &s;he held the child in her arms, calling him the dear image of his father, and thus preventing his e&s;cape. She u&s;ed the &s;ame precautions with regard to his &s;i&s;ters, Octavia and Antonia; and even or|dered an entertainment in the palace, as if to amu&s;e the emperor. At la&s;t, when all things were adju&s;ted, the palace gates were thrown open, and Nero, accompanied by Burrhus, prefect of the Praetorian guards, i&s;&s;ued to re|ceive the congratulations of the people and the army. The cohort then attending, proclaimed
<PB N="215" REF="221">
him with the loude&s;t acclamations, though not without making &s;ome enquiries after Britanni|cus. He was carried in a chariot to the re&s;t of the army; where having made a &s;peech proper to the occa&s;ion, and promi&s;ing them a donation, in the manner of his predece&s;&s;ors, he was de|clared emperor by the army, the &s;enate and the people.</P>
<P>Nero's fir&s;t care was, to &s;hew all po&s;&s;ible re|&s;pect to the decea&s;ed emperor, in order to co|ver the guilt of his death. His ob&s;equies were performed with a pomp, equal to that of Au|gu&s;tus: the young emperor pronounced his fu|neral oration, and He was canonized among the gods, who &s;carce de&s;erved the name of man. The funeral oration, though &s;poken by Nero, was drawn up by Seneca; and it was remarked, that this was the fir&s;t time a Roman emperor needed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another's eloquence.</P>
<P>Nero, though but &s;eventeen years of age, began his reign with the general approbation of mankind. As he owed the empire to Agrip|pina, &s;o, in the beginning, he &s;ubmitted to her directions with the mo&s;t implicit obedience. On her part, &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved on governing with her natural ferocity, and con&s;idered her private animo&s;ities as the only rule to guide her in public ju&s;tice. Immediately after the death of Claudius, &s;he cau&s;ed Silanus, the pro-con|&s;ul of A&s;ia, to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated upon very &s;light
<PB N="216" REF="222">
&s;u&s;picions, and without ever acquainting the emperor with her de&s;ign. The next object of her re&s;entment was Narci&s;&s;us, the late empe|ror's favourite; a man equally notorious for the greatne&s;s of his wealth, and the number of his crimes. He was obliged to put an end to his life, by Agrippina's order, although Nero refu&s;ed his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This bloody out&s;et would have been followed by many &s;everities of the &s;ame nature, had not Seneca and Burrhus, the emperor's tutor and general, oppo&s;ed. The&s;e worthy men, although they owed their ri&s;e to the empre&s;s, were above being the in&s;truments of her cruelty. They, therefore, combined together in an oppo&s;ition, and gaining the young emperor on their &s;ide, formed a plan of power, at once the mo&s;t mer|ciful and wi&s;e. The beginning of this mo|narch's reign, while he continued to act by their coun&s;els, has always been con&s;idered as a model for &s;ucceeding princes to govern by. The famous emperor Trajan u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That for the fir&s;t five years of this prince, all other governments came &s;hort of his."</Q> In fact, the young monarch knew &s;o well how to conceal his innate depravity, that his neare&s;t friends could &s;carce perceive his virtues to be but a&s;|&s;umed. He appeared ju&s;t, liberal, and humane. When a warrant for the execution of a crimina was brought him to be &s;igned, he was heard
<PB N="217" REF="223">
to cry out, with &s;eeming concern, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Would to Heaven that I had never learned to write."</Q> The &s;enate, upon a certain occa&s;ion, giving him their applau&s;e, for the regularity and ju&s;tice of his admini&s;tration; he replied, with &s;ingular mode&s;ty, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they &s;hould defer their thanks till he had de&s;erved them."</Q> His conde|&s;cen&s;ion and affability were not le&s;s than his other virtues; &s;o that the Romans began to think, that Heaven had &s;ent them a prince, who&s;e clemency would compen&s;ate for the ty|ranny of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Agrippina, who was ex|cluded from any &s;hare in government, at|tempted, by every po&s;&s;ible method, to main|tain her declining power. Perceiving that her &s;on had fallen in love with a freedwoman, named Acte, and dreading the influence of a concu|bine, &s;he tried every art to prevent his growing pa&s;&s;ion. However, in &s;o corrupt a court, it was no difficult matter for the emperor to find other confidants, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his wi&s;hes. The gratification of his pa&s;&s;ion, there|fore, in this in&s;tance, only &s;erved to increa&s;e his hatred for the empre&s;s. Nor was it long before he gave evident marks of his di&s;obedi|ence, by di&s;placing Pallas, her chief favourite. It was upon this occa&s;ion, that &s;he fir&s;t per|ceived the total declen&s;ion of her authority, which threw her into the mo&s;t ungovernable
<PB N="218" REF="224">
fury. In order to give terror to her rage, &s;he proclaimed that Britannicus, the real heir to the throne, was &s;till living, and in a condition to receive his father's empire, which was now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by an u&s;urper. She threatened to go to the camp, and there expo&s;e his ba&s;ene&s;s and her own, invoking all the furies to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The&s;e menaces &s;erved to alarm the &s;u&s;picions of Nero, who, though apparently guided by his governors, yet already began to give way to his natural depravity. He, there|fore, determined upon the death of Britannicus, and contrived to have him poi&s;oned at a public banquet. Agrippina, however, &s;till retained her natural ferocity: &s;he took every opportunity of obliging and flattering the tribunes and centu|rions; &s;he heaped up trea&s;ures, with a rapacity beyond her natural avarice; all her actions &s;eemed calculated to rai&s;e a faction, and make her&s;elf formidable to the emperor. Whereupon Nero commanded her German guard to be taken from her, and obliged her to lodge out of the palace. He al&s;o forbid particular per|&s;ons to vi&s;it her, and went him&s;elf but rarely and ceremoniou&s;ly to pay her his re&s;pects. She now, therefore, began to find, that, with the emperor's favour, &s;he had lo&s;t the a&s;&s;iduity of her friends. She was even accu&s;ed by Sillana of con&s;piring again&s;t her &s;on, and of de&s;igning to marry Plautius, a per&s;on de&s;cended from Au|gu&s;tus,
<PB N="219" REF="225">
and of making him emperor. A &s;hort time after, Pallas, her favourite, together with Burrhus, were arraigned for a &s;imilar of|fence, and intending to &s;et up Cornelius Sylla. The&s;e informations being proved void of any foundation, the informers were bani&s;hed; a puni&s;hment which was con&s;idered, as very in|adequate to the greatne&s;s of the offence.</P>
<P>As Nero increa&s;ed in years, his crimes &s;eemed to increa&s;e in equal proportion. He now be|gan to find a plea&s;ure in running about the city by night, di&s;gui&s;ed like a &s;lave. In this vile habit he entered taverns and brothels, attended by the lewd mini&s;ters of his plea&s;ures, attempt|ing the lives of &s;uch as oppo&s;ed him, and fre|quently endangering his own. In imitation of the emperor's example, numbers of profligate young men infe&s;ted the &s;treets likewi&s;e; &s;o that every night the city was filled with tumult and di&s;order. However, the people bore all the&s;e levities, which they a&s;cribed to the emperor's youth, with patience, having occa&s;ion every day to experience his liberality, and having al&s;o been gratified by the abolition of many of their taxes. The provinces al&s;o were no way affected by the&s;e riots; for, except &s;ome di|&s;turbances on the &s;ide of the Parthians, which were &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, they enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect tranquility.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="226">
But tho&s;e &s;en&s;ualties, which, for the four fir&s;t years of his reign, produced but few di&s;orders, in the fifth became alarming. He fir&s;t began to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of decency, by pub|licly abandoning Octavia, his pre&s;ent wife, and then by taking Poppea, the wife of his favourite Otho, a woman more celebrated for her beauty than her virtues. This was another grating circum&s;tance to Agrippina, who vainly u&s;ed all her intere&s;t to di&s;grace Poppea, and re-in&s;tate her&s;elf in her &s;on's lo&s;t favour. Hi&s;torians a&s;|&s;ert, that &s;he even offered to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ions her&s;elf, by an ince&s;tuous compliance; and that, had not Seneca interpo&s;ed, the &s;on would have joined in the mother's crime. This, however, does not &s;eem probable, &s;ince we find Poppea victorious, &s;oon after, in the contention of in|tere&s;ts; and at la&s;t impelling Nero to parricide, to &s;atisfy her revenge. She began her arts by urging him to divorce his pre&s;ent wife, and marry her: &s;he reproached him as a pupil, who wanted not only power over others, but liberty to direct him&s;elf. She in&s;inuated the dangerous de&s;igns of Agrippina, and, by degrees, accu&s;|tomed his mind to reflect upon parricide with|out horror. His cruelties again&s;t his mother began rather by &s;everal circum&s;tances of petty malice, than by any downright injury. He encouraged &s;everal per&s;ons to teize her with liti|gious &s;uits; he employed &s;ome of the meane&s;t
<PB N="221" REF="227">
of the people to &s;ing &s;atirical &s;ongs again&s;t her, under her windows. At la&s;t, finding the&s;e in|effectual, in breaking her &s;pirit, he re&s;olved on putting her to death. His fir&s;t attempt was by poi&s;on; but this, though twice repeated, proved ineffectual, as &s;he had fortified her con|&s;titution again&s;t it by antidotes. This failing, a &s;hip was contrived in &s;o artificial a manner, as to fall to pieces in the water, on board of which, &s;he was invited to &s;ail to the coa&s;ts of Calabria. However, this plot was as ineffectual as the former: the mariners not being all ap|prized of the &s;ecret, di&s;turbed each other's ope|rations; &s;o that the &s;hip not &s;inking as readily as was expected, Agrippina found means to continue &s;wimming, till &s;he was taken up by &s;ome trading ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ing that way. Nero now finding that all his machinations were di&s;|covered, re&s;olved to throw off the ma&s;k, and put her openly to death, without further delay. He therefore cau&s;ed a report to be &s;pread, that &s;he had con&s;pired again&s;t him; and a poignard was dropped at his feet by one, who pretended a command from Agrippina to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. In con&s;equence of this, he applied to his go|vernors Seneca and Burrhus, for their advice how to act, and their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ridding him of the object of his fears. Things were now come to &s;uch a cri&s;is, that no middle way could be taken; and either Nero or Agrippina was
<PB N="222" REF="228">
to fall. Seneca, therefore, kept a profound &s;ilence; while Burrhus, with more re&s;olution, refu&s;ed to be the perpetrator of &s;o great a crime, alledging, that the army was entirely devoted to all the de&s;cendants of Cae&s;ar, and would never be brought to imbrue their hands in the blood of any of his family. In this embarra&s;sment, Anicetus, the contriver of the &s;hip above-men|tioned, offered his &s;ervices; which Nero ac|cepted with the greate&s;t joy, crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That then was the fir&s;t moment he ever found him&s;elf an emperor."</Q> This freed-man, there|fore, taking with him a body of &s;oldiers, &s;ur|rounded the hou&s;e of Agrippina, and then forced open her doors. He next &s;eized upon every &s;lave that he met, until he came near the cham|ber where Agrippina lay. In the mean time, Agrippina, who &s;trove to conceal her con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of Nero's de&s;igns, continued anxiou&s;ly expecting the return of a me&s;&s;enger, whom &s;he had &s;ent with an account of her e&s;cape. How|ever, perceiving a &s;udden &s;tillne&s;s without, among the crowds that had, but a few mo|ments before, been loud in their congratulations; &s;he a&s;ked the cau&s;e, and demanded of the &s;lave who attended her, if her emi&s;&s;ary were returned. While &s;he yet continued &s;peaking, the &s;lave di&s;|appeared, and Anicetus entered the apartment, accompanied by two &s;oldiers, in who&s;e looks &s;he read her fate. She &s;till, however, pre|&s;erved
<PB N="223" REF="229">
pre&s;ence of mind &s;ufficient to a&s;k the cau&s;e of their coming. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If," cried &s;he, "you come to enquire after my health, you may in|form the emperor that I am better; but if you come with any wor&s;e intention, you alone, and not my &s;on, mu&s;t be guilty."</Q> To this the executioners made no reply, but one of them da&s;hed his club at her head, which, however, did not di&s;patch her. Now, therefore, finding that &s;he was to expect no mercy, and &s;eeing Ani|cetus draw his &s;word to &s;tab her, &s;he pre&s;ented her bo&s;om, crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Strike here, for this place gave birth to a mon&s;ter."</Q> The execu|tioners having di&s;patched her, with &s;everal wounds, left her dead on the couch, and went to inform Nero of what they had done. Some hi&s;torians &s;ay, that Nero came immediately to view the body; that he continued to gaze upon it with plea&s;ure, commending &s;ome parts, and di&s;prai&s;ing others; and ending his horrid &s;ur|vey, by cooly ob&s;erving, that he never thought his mother had been &s;o hand&s;ome. However this be, he vindicated his conduct next day to the &s;enate, who not only excu&s;ed, but applaud|ed, his impiety.</P>
<P>All the bounds of virtue being thus broken down, Nero now gave a loo&s;e to his appetites, that were not only &s;ordid, but inhuman. There &s;eemed an odd contra&s;t in his di&s;po&s;ition; for while he practi&s;ed cruelties, which were &s;uffici|ent to make the mind &s;hudder with horror, he
<PB N="224" REF="230">
was fond of tho&s;e amu&s;ing arts that &s;often and refine the heart. He was particularly addicted, even from childhood, to mu&s;ic, and not totally ignorant of poetry. But chariot driving was his favourite pur&s;uit. He never mi&s;&s;ed the circus&punc; when chariot races were to be exhibited there; appearing at fir&s;t privately, and &s;oon after pub|licly; till, at la&s;t, his pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;ing by in|dulgence, he was not content with being merely a &s;pectator, but re&s;olved to become one of the principal performers. His governors, however, did all in their power to re&s;train this perverted ambition; but finding him re&s;olute, they en|clo&s;ed a &s;pace of ground in the valley of the Vatican, where he fir&s;t exhibited only to &s;ome cho&s;en &s;pectators, but &s;hortly after invited the whole town. The prai&s;es of his flattering &s;ub|jects only &s;timulated him &s;till more to the&s;e un|becoming pur&s;uits; &s;o that he now re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume a new character, and to appear as a &s;inger upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>His pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic, as was ob&s;erved, was no le&s;s natural to him than the former; but as it was le&s;s manly, &s;o he endeavoured to defend it by the example of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated men, who practi&s;ed it with the &s;ame fondne&s;s. He had been in&s;tructed in the principles of this art from his childhood; and upon his advance|ment to the empire, he had put him&s;elf under the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters. He patiently &s;ub|mitted to their in&s;tructions, and u&s;ed all tho&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="231">
methods which &s;ingers practice, either to mend the voice, or improve its volubility. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all his a&s;&s;iduity, his voice was but a wretched one, being both feeble and un|plea&s;ant. However, he was re&s;olved to pro|duce it to the public, &s;uch as it was; for flat|tery, he knew, would &s;upply every deficiency. His fir&s;t public appearance was, at games of his own in&s;titution, called Juveniles; where he advanced upon the &s;tage, tuning his in|&s;trument to his voice, with great appearance of &s;kill. A groupe of tribunes and centurions attended behind him; while his old governor, Burrhus, &s;tood by his hopeful pupil, with in|dignation in his countenance, and prai&s;es on his lips.</P>
<P>He was de&s;irous al&s;o of becoming a poet, but he was unwilling to undergo the pain of &s;tudy, which a proficiency in that art requires: he was de&s;irous of being a poet ready-made. For this purpo&s;e, he got together &s;everal per&s;ons, who were con&s;idered as great wits at court, though but very little known as &s;uch to the public. The&s;e attended him with ver&s;es which they had compo&s;ed at home, or which they blabbed out extemporaneou&s;ly; and the whole of their com|po&s;itions being tacked together, by his direction, was called a poem. Nor was he without his phi|lo&s;ophers al&s;o: he took a plea&s;ure in hearing
<PB N="226" REF="232">
their debates after &s;upper, but he heard them merely for his amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Furni&s;hed with &s;uch talents as the&s;e, for giving plea&s;ure, he was re&s;olved to make the tour of his empire, and give the mo&s;t public di&s;play of his abilities wherever he came. The place of his fir&s;t exhibition, upon leaving Rome, was at Naples. The crowds there were &s;o great, and the curio&s;ity of the people &s;o earne&s;t in hearing him, that they did not perceive an earthquake that happened while he was finging. His de&s;ire of gaining the &s;uperiority over the other actors was truly ridiculous: he made in|tere&s;t with his judges, reviled his competitors, formed private factions to &s;upport him, all in imitation of tho&s;e, who got their livelihood up|on the &s;tage. While he continued to perform, no man was permitted to depart from the the|atre, upon any pretence what&s;oever. Some were &s;o fatigued with hearing him, that they leaped privately from the walls, or pretended to fall into fainting fits, in order to be carried out. Nay, it is &s;aid, that &s;everal women were deli|vered in the theatre. Soldiers were placed, in &s;everal parts, to ob&s;erve the looks and ge&s;tures of the &s;pectators, either to direct them where to point their applau&s;e, or re&s;train their di&s;plea|&s;ure. An old &s;enator, named Ve&s;pa&s;ian, hap|pening to fall a&s;leep upon one of the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, very narrowly e&s;caped with his life.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="233">
After being fatigued with the prai&s;es of his countrymen, Nero re&s;olved upon going over into Greece, to receive new theatrical honours. The occa&s;ion was this. The cities of Greece had made a law to &s;end him the mu&s;ical crowns from all the games; and deputies were accord|ingly di&s;patched with this (to him) important emba&s;&s;y. As he one day entertained them at his table, in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner, and conver&s;ed with them with the utmo&s;t familia|rity, they entreated to hear him &s;ing. Upon his complying, the artful Greeks knew how to &s;atisfy his vanity, by the exaggeration of their prai&s;e. They te&s;tified all the marks of exta&s;y and rapture. Applau&s;es &s;o warm, were pecu|liarly plea&s;ing Nero; he could not refrain from crying out, That the Greeks alone were worthy to hear him; and accordingly prepared, with|out delay, to go into Greece, where he &s;pent the whole year en&s;uing. In this journey, his retinue re&s;embled an army in number; but it was only compo&s;ed of &s;ingers, dancers, taylors, and other attendants upon the theatre. He pa&s;&s;ed over all Greece, and exhibited at all their games, which he ordered to be celebrated in one year. At the Olympic games he re&s;olved to &s;hew the people &s;omething extraordinary; wherefore, he drove a chariot with ten hor&s;es: but he &s;ucceeded mo&s;t wretchedly; for being unable to &s;u&s;tain the violence of the motion, he
<PB N="228" REF="234">
was thrown from his &s;eat. The &s;pectators, however, gave him their unanimous applau&s;e, and he was crowned as conqueror. In this manner he obtained the prize at the I&s;thmian, Pythian and Nemean games. The Greeks were not &s;paring of their crowns, he obtained eighteen hundred of them. An unfortunate &s;inger hap|pened to oppo&s;e him on one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, and exerted all the powers of his art, which, it appears, was prodigious. But he &s;eems to have been a better &s;inger than a politician, for Nero ordered him to be killed on the &s;pot. Upon his return from Greece, he entered Na|ples, through a breach in the walls of the city, as was cu&s;tomary with tho&s;e who were conque|rors in the Olympic games. But all the &s;plen|dour of his return, was re&s;erved for his entry into Rome. There he appeared &s;eated in the chariot of Augu&s;tus, dre&s;&s;ed in robes of pur|ple, and crowned with wild olive, which was the Olympic garland. He bore in his hand the Pythian crown, and had eighteen hundred more carried before him. Be&s;ide him &s;ate one Dio|dorus, a mu&s;ician, and behind him followed a band of &s;ingers, as numerous as a legion who &s;ung in honour of his victories. The &s;enate, the knights and the people attended this pu|erile pageant, filling the air with their accla|mations. The whole city was illuminated, every &s;treet &s;moked with incen&s;e; wherever he
<PB N="229" REF="235">
pa&s;&s;ed victims were &s;lain; the pavement was &s;trewed with &s;affron, while garlands of flowers, ribbons, fowls and pa&s;ties, (for &s;o we are told) were &s;howered down upon him from the win|dows as he pa&s;t along. So many honours only enflamed his de&s;ire of acquiring new; he at la&s;t began to take le&s;&s;ons in wre&s;tling, willing to immitate Hercules in &s;trength, as he had rivalled Apollo in activity. He al&s;o cau&s;ed a lion of pa&s;teboard to be made with great art, again&s;t which he undauntedly appeared in the theatre, and &s;truck it down with a blow of his club.</P>
<P>But it had been happy for mankind, had he confined him&s;elf to the&s;e puerilities, and, contented with being contemptible, had not &s;ought to become formidable al&s;o. His cruel|ties even out-did all his other extravagancies. A complete li&s;t of tho&s;e would exceed the limits of the pre&s;ent work, and would pre&s;ent the reader with an hideous repetition of &s;u&s;picions without cau&s;e, and puni&s;hments without mercy. Soon after the death of Agrippina, he ordered Domitia his aunt to be poi&s;oned. Some &s;ay that Burrhus, who died &s;hortly after, was &s;erved in the &s;ame manner. Rebellius Plancus, toge|ther <MILESTONE N="63" UNIT="A.D."> with Pallas, Agrippina's favourite, were about this time put to death, the former for being of the Cae&s;arean family, the latter for being rich. Octavia his wife was divorced, and
<PB N="230" REF="236">
likewi&s;e put to death; and Poppaea made em|pre&s;s in her place. Sylla, and Torquatus Syl|lanus, with many others, either fell by the executioner, or gave them&s;elves a voluntary death.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed even &s;tudious of finding out plea|&s;ures as well as crimes again&s;t nature. Being attired in the habit of a woman, and covered with a yellow veil like a bride, he was wedded to one of his abominable companions called Pythagoras, and again to his freedman Dori|phorus. On the other hand, that he might be every way dete&s;table, he became the hu&s;band of a youth named Sporus, whom he had pre|viou&s;ly deprived of the marks of virility. With this prepo&s;terous bride, decked out in all the ornaments of an empre&s;s, he went to all public places: they always rode together in his cha|riot, and he &s;crupled not to treat him as a wo|man, in the &s;ight of the wondering multitude. However, tho' he e&s;caped their anger, he did not fail to incur their ridicule. It was ob&s;er|ved upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, that the world had been happy if the emperor's father had been married only to &s;uch a &s;pou&s;e. But he little regarded what the wi&s;er part of mankind thought of him. He was often heard to ob|&s;erve, that he had rather be hated than loved. When one happened to &s;ay in his pre&s;ence, That the world might be burnt when he was
<PB N="231" REF="237">
dead: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nay," replied Nero, "let it be burnt while I am alive."</Q> In fact, a great part of the city of Rome was con&s;umed by fire &s;hortly after; and mo&s;t hi&s;torians a&s;cribe the confla|gration to him. It is &s;aid that he &s;tood upon an high tower, during the continuance of the flames, enjoying the &s;ight, and repeating in a player's habit, and in a theatrical manner, &s;ome ver&s;es upon the de&s;truction of Troy. As a proof of his guilt upon this occa&s;ion, none were permitted to lend any a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards extin|gui&s;hing the flames; and &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;een &s;etting fire to the hou&s;es, alledging, that they had orders for &s;o doing. However this be, the emperor u&s;ed every art to throw the odium of &s;o dete&s;table an action from him&s;elf, and to fix it upon the Chri&s;tians, who were at that time gaining ground in Rome. Nothing could be more dreadful than the per&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t them upon this fal&s;e accu&s;ation. Some were covered with the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, and in that figure devoured by dogs. Some were crucified, and others burnt alive. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When the day was not &s;ufficient for their tortures, the flames in which they peri&s;hed, &s;ays Tacitus, &s;erved to illuminate the night;"</Q> while Nero, dre&s;t in the habit of a charioteer, regaled him|&s;elf with their tortures from his gardens, and entertained the people at one time with their &s;ufferings, at another with the games of the
<PB N="232" REF="238">
circus. In this per&s;ecution, St. Paul was be|headed, and St. Peter was crucified with his head downwards; which death he cho&s;e, as being more di&s;honourable than that of his di|vine ma&s;ter. The inhuman mon&s;ter, con&s;cious of being &s;u&s;pected of burning the city, in order to free him&s;elf from the &s;candal, took great care to re-edify it with even greater beauty than before. But he &s;et no bounds to the magni|ficence with which his own palace, which had &s;hared in the conflagration, was rebuilt. It now received the name of the golden palace, from the rich materials of which it was com|po&s;ed, as all the apartments were adorned with the riche&s;t metals, and the mo&s;t precious jewels. The principal hall was circular, and the cieling moveable, and went round in imi|tation of the heavenly motions. The extent of the palace was not le&s;s amazing than its beauty. It was &s;o large as to contain within its walls, lakes, parks, and vineyards. The entrance was &s;pacious enough to receive a colo&s;&s;al &s;ta|tue of the emperor, an hundred and twenty feet high. In &s;hort, nothing, either before or &s;ince, ever equalled the magnificence or rich|ne&s;s of this &s;tructure. Nero, however, when it was fini&s;hed, only &s;aid coolly, that he was now lodged like a man. But he did not &s;eem to regard the extortions and exactions in all the provinces, which were made to &s;upport
<PB N="233" REF="239">
this &s;tyle of expence. The oppre&s;&s;ion and the mi&s;ery of mankind &s;eemed to be his plea|&s;ure, and he was every day contented to fea&s;t upon the de&s;olation of a province, at a &s;ingle meal.</P>
<P>Hitherto, however, the citizens of Rome &s;eemed comparatively exempted from his cru|elties, which chiefly fell upon &s;trangers, and his neare&s;t connections. A con&s;piracy formed again&s;t him by Pi&s;o, a man of great power and integrity, which was prematurely di&s;co|vered, opened a new train of &s;u&s;picions that de&s;troyed many of the principal families in Rome. This con&s;piracy, in which &s;everal of the chief men of the city were concerned, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the indi&s;creet zeal of a wo|man named Epicharis, who, by &s;ome means now unknown, had been let into the plot, which &s;he revealed to Volu&s;ius, a tribune, in order to prevail upon him to be an accom|plice. Volu&s;ius, in&s;tead of coming into her de&s;ign, went and di&s;covered what he had learnt to Nero, who immediately put Epicharis in pri&s;on. Soon after, a freedman belonging to Scaenius, one of the accomplices, made a far|ther di&s;covery. The con&s;pirators were exa|mined apart, and as their te&s;timonies differed, they were put to the torture. Natalis was the fir&s;t who made a confe&s;&s;ion of his own guilt, and that of many others. Scaevinus gave a li&s;t
<PB N="234" REF="240">
of the con&s;pirators &s;till more ample. Lucan, the poet, was among&s;t the number, and he, like the re&s;t, in order to &s;ave him&s;elf, &s;till farther enlarged the catalogue, naming among others Attilia, his own mother. Epicharis was now, therefore, again called upon and put to the torture; but her fortitude was proof again&s;t all the tyrant's cruelty; neither &s;courging, nor burning, nor all the malicious methods u&s;ed by the executioners, could extort the &s;malle&s;t confe&s;&s;ion. She was therefore remanded to pri&s;on, with orders to have her tortures renewed the day following. In the mean time, &s;he found an opportunity of &s;trangling her&s;elf with her handkerchief, by hanging it again&s;t the back of her chair. It need &s;carcely be a&s;ked, whe|ther the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators were put to death under &s;uch a prince as Nero, who&s;e daily cu&s;tom was to condemn even the innocent. Pi&s;o, Lateranus, Fennius Rufus, Subrius Fla|vius, Sulpicius A&s;per, Ve&s;tinus the con&s;ul, and numberle&s;s others, were all executed without mercy. But the two mo&s;t remarkable per&s;on|ages who fell on this occa&s;ion were Seneca the philo&s;opher, and Lucan the poet, who was his nephew. It is not certainly known, whether Seneca was really concerned in this con&s;piracy or not. This great man had for &s;ome time perceived the outrageous conduct of his pupil, and finding him&s;elf incapable of
<PB N="235" REF="241">
controlling his &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, had retire d from court into &s;olitude and privacy. How|ever, his retreat did not now protect him, for Nero either having real te&s;timony again&s;t him, or el&s;e hating him for his virtues, &s;ent a tribune informing him that he was &s;u&s;pected as an ac|complice. The tribune found the philo&s;opher at table with Paulina his wife, and informing him of his bu&s;ine&s;s, Seneca replied without any emotion, that his welfare depended up|on no man; that he had never been accu&s;|tomed to indulge the errors of the emperor, and would not do it now. When this an&s;wer was brought back to Nero, he demanded whe|ther Seneca &s;eemed afraid to die; the tribune replying that he did not appear in the lea&s;t ter|rified; "then go to him again," cried the em|peror, "and give him my orders to die." This tribune was him&s;elf one of the con&s;pi|rators; &s;o that in&s;tead of immediately returning, he went to a&s;k the opinion of Fennius Rufus, his commander, whether he &s;hould obey. Upon Fennius's advi&s;ing him to it, he &s;ent a centu|rion to Seneca, &s;ignifying that it was the em|peror's plea&s;ure that he &s;hould die. Upon re|ceiving this fatal command, Seneca &s;eemed no way di&s;compo&s;ed, but called for his will, in order to make &s;ome additions to it in favour of &s;ome friends that were then with him. This your, however, the centurion refu&s;ed to grant
<PB N="236" REF="242">
him; upon which Seneca, turning to his friends, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ince then," cried he, "I am not permitted to leave you any other marks of my affection, at lea&s;t, I leave you one legacy more pre|cious than all the re&s;t, my example."</Q> Then comforting their di&s;tre&s;s, and embracing his wife, the memory of her pa&s;t affection &s;eemed to melt him into tears. However, no way un|mindful of his con&s;tancy, he endeavoured to con&s;ole her for his lo&s;s, and exhort her to a life of per&s;evering virtue. But &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved on not &s;urviving him, and pre&s;t her reque&s;t to die with him &s;o earne&s;tly, that Seneca, who had long looked upon death as a benefit, at la&s;t gave his con&s;ent, and the veins of both their arms were opened at the &s;ame time. As Seneca was old, and much enfeebled by the au&s;terities of his life, the blood flowed but &s;lowly, &s;o that he cau&s;ed the veins of his legs and thighs to be opened al&s;o. His pains were long and violent, but they were not ca|pable of repre&s;&s;ing his fortitude or his elo|quence. He dictated a di&s;cour&s;e to two &s;ecre|taries, which was read with great avidity after his death by the people, but which has &s;ince peri&s;hed in the wreck of time. His agonies being now drawn out to a great length, he at la&s;t demanded poi&s;on from his phy&s;ician; but this al&s;o failed of its effect, his body being already exhau&s;ted, and incapable of exciting
<PB N="237" REF="243">
its operation. He was from this carried into a warm bath, which only &s;erved to prolong his end; at length, therefore, he was put into a dry &s;tove, the vapour of which quickly di&s;|patched him. In the mean time, his wife Pau|lina, having fallen into a &s;woon with the lo&s;s of blood, had her arms bound up by her do|me&s;tics, and by this means &s;urvived her hu&s;band for &s;ome years, but by her conduct during the re&s;t of her life, &s;he &s;eemed always mindful of her own love and his example.</P>
<P>The death of Lucan was not le&s;s remark|able. The veins of his arms being opened&punc; after he had lo&s;t a great quantity of blood, perceiving his hands and legs already dead, while the vital parts &s;till continued warm and vigorous, he called to mind a de&s;cription in his own poem of the Phar&s;alia, of a per&s;on dying in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and expired while he was repeating that beautiful pa&s;&s;age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Nec &s;icut vulnere &s;anguis</L>

<P>Nor were the Roman provinces in a better &s;ituation than the capital city. The example of the tyrant &s;eemed to influence his gover|nors, who gave in&s;tances not only of their ra|pacity, but their cruelty in every part of the empire. In the &s;eventh year of his reign&punc; the Britons revolted under the conduct of their queen Boadicia. Paulinus, the Roman general, being at that time employed with part of the legions in expelling the Druids from the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey; his lieutenants in his ab&s;ence com|mitted &s;uch barbarities as were intolerable to the inhabitants. Boadicia, queen of the Iceni, was treated with peculiar indignity, being con|demned to be &s;courged, and her daughters deflowered by the &s;oldiery. In revenge, there|fore, at the head of a numerous army, &s;he
<PB N="239" REF="245">
fell upon the Romans wherever they were un|provided, took their ca&s;tles, de&s;troyed the chief &s;eats of their power at London and Verulam, and &s;o great was her fury, that &s;eventy thou|&s;and Romans peri&s;hed in this revolt. But the Roman general &s;oon after revenged his coun|trymen by a great and deci&s;ive battle, in which eighty thou&s;and Britons are &s;aid to have peri&s;h|ed; and Boadicia her&s;elf, rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her life by poi&s;on. By this remarkable defeat, the Britons ever after, during the continuance of the Romans among them, lo&s;t not only all hopes, but even all de&s;ire of freedom.</P>
<P>A war al&s;o was carried on again&s;t the Parthians, for the greate&s;t part of this reign, conducted by Corbuto; who, after many &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;t Tiridates, and &s;ettled Tigranes in Arme|nia in his room. Tiridates, however, was &s;oon after re&s;tored by an inva&s;ion of the Parthiana into that country; but being once more oppo&s;ed by Corbulo, the Romans and Parthians came to an agreement that Tiridates &s;hould continue to govern Armenia, upon condition that he &s;hould lay down his crown at the feet of the emperor's &s;tatue, and receive it as coming from him; all which he &s;hortly after performed. A ceremo|ny, however, which Nero de&s;ired to have re|peated to his per&s;on; wherefore, by letters and promi&s;es, he invited Tiridates to Rome, granting
<PB N="240" REF="246">
him the mo&s;t magnificent &s;upplies for his jour|ney. Nero attended his arrival with very &s;ump|tuous preparations. He received him &s;eated on a throne, accompanied by the &s;enate &s;tanding round him, and the whole army drawn out with all imaginable &s;plendour. Tiridates a&s;cended the throne with great reverence, and approaching the emperor, fell down at his feet&punc; and in the mo&s;t abject terms acknowledged him|&s;elf his &s;lave. Nero rai&s;ed him up, telling him with equal arrogance, that he did well, and that by his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he had gained a king|dom which his ance&s;tors could never acquire by their arms. He then placed the crown on his head, and, after the mo&s;t co&s;tly ceremonies and entertainments, he was &s;ent back to Armenia with incredible &s;ums of money to defray the expences of his return.</P>
<P>In the twelfth year of this emperor's reign, the Jews al&s;o revolted, having been &s;everely oppre&s;t by the Roman governors. It is &s;aid that Florus, in particular, was arrived at that degree of tyranny, that by public proclama|tion he gave permi&s;&s;ion to plunder the country, provided he received half the &s;poil. The&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions drew &s;uch a train of calamities after them, that the &s;ufferings of all other nations were &s;light in compari&s;on to what this devoted people afterwards endured. I &s;hall mention them more at length in the reign of Ve&s;pa|&s;ian,
<PB N="241" REF="247">
in which, as Chri&s;t had prophe&s;ied, they came to a completion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Nero proceeded in his cruelties at Rome, with unabated &s;everity. Rufius Cri&s;pinus, and Annaeus Mella, the bro|ther of Seneca, were de&s;troyed upon &s;light &s;u&s;|picions. The death of Petronius about this <MILESTONE N="817" UNIT="A. U."> <MILESTONE N="66" UNIT="A.D."> time, is too remarkable to be pa&s;t over in &s;i|lence. This per&s;on, whom many modern hi&s;torians &s;uppo&s;e to be the author of a work of no great merit, intituled Satyricon, which is &s;till remaining, was an epicurean, both in prin|ciple and practice. In &s;o luxurious a court as that of Nero, he was particularly noted for his refinements in luxury. He was by no means a low &s;en&s;ual debauchee, but chiefly remark|able for giving the mo&s;t &s;tudied attempts in wit an air of the mo&s;t elegant &s;implicity. Nero had cho&s;en him among the number of his de|pendants, as the arbiter of his plea&s;ures, an office which Tigelinus re&s;olved to enjoy &s;olely to him&s;elf, and therefore re&s;olved upon his de|&s;truction. He was accu&s;ed accordingly of be|ing privy to Pi&s;o's con&s;piracy, and committed to pri&s;on. Petronius could not endure the anxiety of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, wherefore he re&s;olved upon putting him&s;elf to death; which he performed in a manner entirely &s;imilar to that in which he had lived. He opened his veins, and then clo&s;ed them as he thought lea&s;t painful, with
<PB N="242" REF="248">
the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s and tranquillity. He conver&s;ed with his friends, not upon maxims of philo&s;ophy, or grave &s;ubjects, but upon &s;uch topics as had amu&s;ed his gaye&s;t revels. He li&s;tened while they recited the lighte&s;t poems; and by no action, no word, nor circum&s;tance, &s;hewed the perplexity of a dying per&s;on. Shortly after him, Numicius Thermus was put to death, as likewi&s;e Barea Soranus, and Petus Thra&s;ea. The de&s;troying the two la&s;t, Ta|citus calls an attack upon virtue it&s;elf. Thra|&s;ea died in the mid&s;t of his friends and phi|lo&s;ophers, conver&s;ing and rea&s;oning on the na|ture of the &s;oul. His wife, who was the daughter of the celebrated Arria, was de&s;irous of following her mother's example, but he di&s;|&s;uaded her from it. The death of the valiant Corbulo, who had gained Nero &s;o many vic|tories over the Parthians, followed next. Nor did the empre&s;s Poppea her&s;elf e&s;cape, whom, in a fit of anger, he kicked when &s;he was preg|nant, by which &s;he mi&s;carried and died. At length, human nature grew weary of bearing her per&s;ecutor, and the whole world &s;eemed to rouze, as if by common con&s;ent, to rid the earth of a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>The inbred di&s;tempers of the empire, which had been contracted under the dete&s;table go|vernment of four &s;ucceeding princes now began to di&s;cover them&s;elves in their furious effects&punc;
<PB N="243" REF="249">
and there appeared a general revolution in all the provinces.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appeared in Gaul, under Julius Vindex, who commanded the legions there, and publickly prote&s;ted again&s;t the tyrannical government of Nero. He appeared to have no other motive for this revolt than that of freeing the world from an oppre&s;&s;or; for when it was told him that Nero had &s;et a reward upon his head of ten millions of &s;e&s;terces, he made this gallant an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whoever brings me Nero's head, &s;hall, if he plea&s;es, have mine."</Q> But &s;till more to &s;hew, he was not actuated by mo|tives of private ambition, he proclaimed Sergius Galba, emperor, and invited him to join in the revolt. Sergius Galba, who was at that time governor of Spain, was equally remarkable for his wi&s;dom in peace, and his courage in war. But as all talents under corrupt princes are dan|gerous, he for &s;ome years had &s;eemed willing to court ob&s;curity, giving him&s;elf up to an in|active life, and avoiding all opportunities of &s;ignalizing his valour. He now therefore, either through the caution attending old age, or from a total want of ambition, appeared little enclined to join with Vindex, and con|tinued for &s;ome time to deliberate with his friends on the part he &s;hould take.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Nero, who had been ap|prized of the proceedings again&s;t him in Gaul,
<PB N="244" REF="250">
appeared totally regardle&s;s of the danger, pri|vately flattering him&s;elf that the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this revolt would give him an opportunity of fre&s;h confi&s;cations. He appeared therefore at the theatre as u&s;ual, and &s;eemed to intere&s;t him&s;elf as warmly in the conte&s;ts there, as if he had totally forgot that there was a contention for his empire. Being then at Naples, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf in his letters to the &s;enate, for not immediately coming to Rome, as he was detained by an hoar&s;ene&s;s which he was afraid to encrea&s;e. The care of his voice was &s;till uppermo&s;t in his mind, and nothing &s;eemed to give him greater unea&s;ine&s;s than that Vindex in his manife&s;toes &s;hould call him a mi&s;erable mu&s;ician. He frequently a&s;ked tho&s;e about him, whether it was po&s;&s;ible one who had &s;tudied the art &s;o long and care|fully as he had done, &s;hould be the bungler he was repre&s;ented by Vindex.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the revolt growing more formidable every hour, Nero returned to Rome with a mixture of hope, exultation and revenge. Ob&s;erving an ancient monu|ment by the way &s;ide, on which were the &s;ta|tues of a Roman knight overcoming a Gauli&s;h &s;oldier, he looked upon this as a favourable omen, and was tran&s;ported with plea&s;ure at the adventure. Upon entering the city, he con|vened a few of his creatures among the &s;enate,
<PB N="245" REF="251">
and entertained them not by deliberations upon the &s;tate of his affairs, but by &s;hewing them &s;ome mu&s;ical in&s;truments that were to be play|ed upon by water. He explained to them their mechani&s;m, their advantages, and defects, ad|ding with an ironical air, <Q REND="inline">"that he hoped with Vindex's permi&s;&s;ion, to exhibit this in&s;trument upon the theatre."</Q></P>
<P>The actual revolt of Galba, the news of which arrived &s;oon after, affected him in a very different manner. The reputation of that ge|neral was &s;uch, that from the moment he de|clared again&s;t him, Nero con&s;idered him&s;elf as undone. He received the account as he was at &s;upper, and, in&s;tantly &s;truck with terror, over|turned the table with his foot, breaking two cry|&s;tal va&s;es of immen&s;e value. He then fell into a &s;woon, from which when he recovered, he tore his cloaths, and &s;truck his head, crying out, "that he was utterly undone." It was then that he began to meditate &s;laughters more ex|ten&s;ive than he yet had committed, and tortures yet untried. He was re&s;olved to ma&s;&s;acre all the governors of provinces, to de&s;troy all exiles, and to murder all the Gauls in Rome, as a puni&s;hment for the treachery of their country|men. In &s;hort, in the wildne&s;s of his rage, he thought of poi&s;oning the whole &s;enate, of burning the city, and turning the lions kept for the purpo&s;es of the theatre, out upon the
<PB N="246" REF="252">
people. The&s;e de&s;igns being impracticable, he re&s;olved, at la&s;t, to face the danger in per&s;on. But his very preparations &s;erved to mark the infatuation of his mind. His principal care was, to provide waggons for the convenient carriage of his mu&s;ical in&s;truments; and to dre&s;s out his concubines like Amazons, with whom he intended to face the enemy. He al&s;o made a re&s;olution, that if he came off with &s;afe|ty and empire, he would appear again upon the theatre with the lute and the water-mu&s;ic, and would equip him&s;elf as a pantomime.</P>
<P>While Nero was thus frivolou&s;ly employed, the revolt became general. Not only the ar|mies in Spain and Gaul, but al&s;o the legions in Germany, Africa and Lu&s;itania, declared again&s;t him. Virginius Rufus alone, who commanded an army on the Upper Rhine, for a while con|tinued in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; during which, his forces, without his permi&s;&s;ion, falling upon the Gauls, routed them with great &s;laughter, and Vin|dex &s;lew him&s;elf. But this ill &s;ucce&s;s no way advanced the intere&s;ts of Nero; he was &s;o de|te&s;ted by the whole empire, that he could find none of the armies faithful to him, however they might di&s;agree with each other. He, therefore, called for Locu&s;ta to furni&s;h him with poi&s;on; and thus prepared for the wor&s;t, he retired to the Servelian gardens, with a re&s;o|lution of flying into Egypt. He accordingly
<PB N="247" REF="253">
di&s;patched the freed-men, in whom he had the mo&s;t confidence, to prepare a fleet at O&s;tia; and, in the mean while, &s;ounded, in per&s;on, the tribunes and centurions of the guard, to know if they were willing to &s;hare his fortunes. But they all excu&s;ed them&s;elves, under divers pretexts. One of them had the boldne&s;s to an&s;wer him, by part of a line from Virgil: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>U&s;que adeone mi&s;erum e&s;t mori:</HI> Is death then &s;uch a misfortune?"</Q> Thus de&s;titute of every re&s;ource, all the expedients that cowardice, revenge, or terror could produce, took place in his mind by turns. He, at one time, re&s;olved to take refuge among the Parthians; at another, to deliver him|&s;elf up to the mercy of the in&s;urgents: one while, he determined to mount the ro&s;trum, to a&s;k pardon, for what was pa&s;t, and to conclude with promi&s;e of amendment for the future. With the&s;e gloomy deliberations he went to bed, but waking about midnight, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find his guards had left him. The Praetorian &s;oldiers, in fact, having been corrupted by their commander, had retired to their camp, and proclaimed Galba emperor. Nero imme|diately &s;ent for his friends, to deliberate upon his pre&s;ent exigence, but his friends al&s;o for|&s;ook him; even Tigelinus him&s;elf, the creature of his benefits, and the partaker of his guilt, had gone over to Galba. He went in per&s;on,
<PB N="248" REF="254">
from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, but all the doors were &s;hut again&s;t him, and none were found to an&s;wer his enquiries. While he was pur&s;uing this enquiry, his very dome&s;tics followed the general defection; and, having plundered his apartment, e&s;caped different ways. Being now reduced to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, he de&s;ired that one of his fa|vourite gladiators might come and di&s;patch him; but even in this reque&s;t, there was none found to obey. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas," cried he, "have I neither friend nor enemy!"</Q> And then run|ing de&s;perately forth, &s;eemed re&s;olved to plunge headlong into the Tyber. But ju&s;t then his cou|rage beginning to fail him, he made a &s;udden &s;top, as if willing to recollect his rea&s;on, and a&s;ked for &s;ome &s;ecret place, where he might re a&s;&s;ume his courage, and meet death with be|coming fortitude. In this di&s;tre&s;s, Phaon, one of his freedmen, offered him his country-hou&s;e, about four miles di&s;tant, where he might, for &s;ome time, remain concealed. Nero accepted his offer; and, half dre&s;&s;ed as he was, with his head covered, and hiding his face with an handkerchief, he mounted on hor&s;eback, at|tended by four of his dome&s;tics, of whom the wretched Sporus was one. His journey, though &s;hort, was crowded with adventures. An earth|quake gave him the fir&s;t alarm. The lightning from Heaven next fla&s;hed in his face. Round
<PB N="249" REF="255">
him he heard nothing but confu&s;ed noi&s;es from the camp, and the cries of the &s;oldiers, impre|cating a thou&s;and evils upon his head. A pa&s;|&s;enger, meeting him on the way, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There go men in pur&s;uit of Nero."</Q> Another a&s;ked him, if there were any news of Nero in the city. His hor&s;e taking fright at a dead body, that lay near the road, he dropped his handker|chief and a &s;oldier who was near, addre&s;&s;ed him by name. He now, therefore, quitted his hor&s;e, and for&s;aking the highway, entered a thicket, that led towards the back part of Phaon's hou&s;e, through which he crept, making the be&s;t of his way among the reeds and brambles, with which the place was overgrown. When he was arrived at the back part of the hou&s;e, while he was waiting till there &s;hould be a breach made in the wall, he took up &s;ome water in the hollow of his hands, from a pool to drink; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are the delicacies of Nero."</Q> When the hole was made large enough to admit him, he crept in upon all fours, and took a &s;hort repo&s;e upon a wretched pallet, that had been prepared for his reception. Being pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, he demanded &s;omewhat to eat; they brought him a piece of brown bread, which he refu&s;ed; but drank a little water. During this interval, the &s;enate finding the Praetorian guards had taken part with Galba, declared him emperor, and
<PB N="250" REF="256">
condemned Nero to die, <HI>more majorum;</HI> that is, according to the rigour of the ancient laws. The&s;e dreadful tidings were quickly brought by one of Phaon's &s;laves from the city, while Nero yet continued lingering between his hopes and his fears. At one time, this mo&s;t wretched of all mankind, was employed in providing &s;tones for his tomb; at another, in preparing wood and water for his funeral; now repeating ver&s;es, expre&s;&s;ive of the horrors of his mind; again giving vent to his tears, and crying out, <Q REND="inline">"What an arti&s;t is the world likely to loo&s;e!"</Q> When he was told of the re&s;olution of the &s;enate again&s;t him, he a&s;ked the me&s;&s;enger what was meant, by being puni&s;hed accord|ing to the rigour of the ancient laws? To this he was an&s;wered, that the criminal was to be &s;tripped naked, his head was to be fixed in a pillory, and in that po&s;ture he was to be &s;courged to death. Nero was &s;o terrified at this, that he &s;eized two poniards, which he had brought with him, and examining their points, returned them to their &s;heaths, pretending, that the fatal moment was not yet arrived. He then de&s;ired Sporus to begin the lamentations which were u&s;ed at funerals; he next intreated that &s;ome one of his attendants would die, to give him courage by his example; and after|wards began to reproach his own cowardice,
<PB N="251" REF="257">
crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Does this become Nero? Is this trifling well timed? No, no, let me be courageous."</Q> In fact, he had no time to &s;pare, for the &s;oldiers who had been &s;ent in pur&s;uit of him, were ju&s;t then approaching the hou&s;e: wherefore, hearing the &s;ound of the hor&s;es feet, he &s;et a dagger to his throat, with which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Epaphroditus, his freedman and &s;ecretary, he gave him&s;elf a mor|tal wound. However, he was not yet quite dead, when one of the centurions entering the room, and pretending he came to his relief, attempted to &s;top the blood with his cloak. But Nero regarding him with a &s;tern countenance, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is now too late. Is this your fidelity?"</Q> Upon which, with his eyes fixed, and fright|fully &s;taring, he expired, even in death a gha&s;t|ly &s;pectacle of innoxious tyranny.</P>
<P>Little need be &s;aid concerning the character of a monarch, who&s;e very name is become a term of reproach to all bad princes. His natural di&s;po&s;ition was extremely bad, but it was ren|dered &s;till more dete&s;table by flattery. All or|ders of men were, at this time, &s;o depraved, that each &s;eemed eager to contend, which &s;hould be mo&s;t in&s;trumental in pu&s;hing him on to his exce&s;&s;es, and applauding him when he had committed them. It mu&s;t be a &s;trong mind, that, being a&s;&s;aulted thus, on every &s;ide, can
<PB N="252" REF="258">
&s;tand un&s;haken, and trace out for it&s;elf the track of undeviating virtue. Thus much, I think, we may &s;ay of this mo&s;t wretched man, notwith&s;tanding the concurrent reproach of all hi&s;torians, that through the greate&s;t part of his reign, he him&s;elf &s;eemed ignorant of his being a tyrant.</P>
<P>He reigned thirteen years, &s;even months and twenty-eight days, and died in the thirty-&s;econd year of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. SERGIUS GALBA, the Seventh EMPEROR of Rome. <MILESTONE N="821" UNIT="U. C."></HEAD>
<P>THE rejoicings at Rome, upon Nero's <MILESTONE N="69" UNIT="A.D."> death, were as great as tho&s;e upon his acce&s;&s;ion. All per&s;ons came running into the &s;treets to congratulate each other upon the death of the tyrant; dre&s;t in the manner of &s;laves, who had been ju&s;t &s;et free.</P>
<P>Galba was &s;eventy-two years old when he was declared emperor, and was then in Spain with his legions. However, he &s;oon found that his being rai&s;ed to the throne, was but an inlet to new di&s;quietudes. His fir&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment aro&s;e from a di&s;order in his own army; for upon his approaching the camp, one of the wings of his hor&s;e, repenting of their choice, prepared to revolt, and he found it no ea&s;y matter to reconcile them to their duty. He al&s;o nar|rowly e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, from &s;ome &s;laves, who were pre&s;ented to him by one of Nero's freedmen, with that intent. The death of Vindex al&s;o &s;erved not a little to add to his di&s;|quietudes; &s;o that, upon his very entrance into empire, he had &s;ome thoughts of putting an end to his own life. But, hearing from Rome,
<PB N="254" REF="260">
that Nero was dead, and the empire transferred to him, he immediately a&s;&s;umed the title and en&s;igns of command. In his journey towards Rome, he was met by Rufus Virginius, who finding the &s;enate had decreed him the govern|ment, came to yield him obedience. This ge|neral had more than once refu&s;ed the empire him&s;elf, which was offered him by his &s;oldiers, alledging, that the &s;enate alone had the di&s;|po&s;al of it; and from them only he would ac|cept the honour. Shortly after this, many of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t notorious during the la&s;t reign, and who attempted to di&s;turb the pre&s;ent, were cut off. Among the&s;e were Nymphidius Sabinus, praefect of the Praetorian guards at Rome; Fonteius Capito, lieutenant in Ger|many; and Clodius Macer, pro-con&s;ul in Africa.</P>
<P>Galba having been brought to the empire by means of his army, was, at the &s;ame time, will|ing to &s;uppre&s;s their power to commit any future di&s;turbance. His fir&s;t approach to Rome, was attended with one of tho&s;e rigorous &s;trokes of ju&s;tice which ought rather to be defended than immitated. A body of mariners, whom Nero had taken from the oar, and enli&s;ted among the legions, went to meet Galba, three miles from the city, and with loud importunities demanded a confirmation of what his predece&s;&s;or had done in their favour. Galba, who was rigidly attached
<PB N="255" REF="261">
to the ancient di&s;cipline, deferred their reque&s;t to another time. But they, con&s;idering this de|lay as equivalent to an ab&s;olute denial, in&s;i&s;ted upon their reque&s;t, in a very di&s;repectful man|ner; and even &s;ome of them had recour&s;e to arms: whereupon, Galba ordered a body of hor&s;e attending him, to ride in among them, and thus killed &s;even thou&s;and of them; but not content with this puni&s;hment, he afterwards ordered them to be decimated. Their in&s;olence demand|ed correction; but &s;uch exten&s;ive puni&s;hments deviated into cruelty. His next &s;tep to curb the in&s;olence of the &s;oldiers, was his di&s;charging the German cohort, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the former emperors, as a guard to their per|&s;ons. Tho&s;e he &s;ent home to their own country, unrewarded, pretending they were di&s;affected to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to have two other objects al&s;o in view: namely, to puni&s;h tho&s;e vices which had come to an enormous height in the la&s;t reign, with the &s;tricte&s;t &s;everity; and to repleni&s;h the exchequer, which had been quite drained by the prodigality of his predece&s;&s;ors. The&s;e attempts only brought on him the imputation of &s;everity and avarice; the &s;tate was too much corrupted to admit of &s;uch an immediate tran&s;ition from vice to virtue, as this worthy, but weak poli|tician, attempted to effect. The people had long been maintained in &s;loth and luxury, by
<PB N="256" REF="262">
the prodigality of the former emperors, and could not think of being obliged to &s;eek for new means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or retrench their &s;u|perfluities. They began, therefore, to &s;atirize the old man, and turn the &s;implicity of his man|ners into ridicule. Among the marks of ava|rice recorded of him, he is &s;aid to have groaned upon having an expen&s;ive &s;oup &s;erved up to his table; he is &s;aid to have pre&s;ented to his &s;tew|ard, for his fidelity, a plate of beans; a famous player upon the flute, named Canus, having greatly delighted him, it is reported, that he drew out his pur&s;e, and gave him five pence, telling him, that it was private, and not public money. By &s;uch ill-judg'd frugalities, at &s;uch a time, Galba began to lo&s;e his popularity; and he who, before his acce&s;&s;ion, was e&s;teemed by all, now being become emperor, was con&s;idered with ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome circum&s;tances of avarice alledged again&s;t him, le&s;s equivocal than tho&s;e trifling ones already mentioned. Shortly after his coming to Rome, the people were pre&s;ented with a mo&s;t grateful &s;pectacle; which was that of Locu&s;ta, Elius, Polycletus, Patronius, and Pe|tinus, all the bloody mini&s;ters of Nero's cru|elty, drawn in fetters through the city, and publickly executed. But Tigelinus, the mo&s;t notorious offender of all, was not there. This crafty villain had taken care for his own &s;afety,
<PB N="257" REF="263">
by the largene&s;s of his bribes; and though the people cried cut for vengeance again&s;t him, at the theatre, and the circus, yet the emperor granted him his life and pardon. Helotus, the eunuch, al&s;o, who had been the in&s;trument of poi&s;oning Claudius, e&s;caped, and ow'd his &s;afety to the proper application of his wealth.</P>
<P>This collu&s;ion, however, was owing rather to the avarice of Galba's favourites than to his; for, whether from the infirmity of age, or the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, he now &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be entirely governed by three favourites; who, being continually in his pre&s;ence, were commonly &s;tyled his ma&s;ters. The&s;e were, Titus Venius, who had been his lieutenant in Spain, a man of in&s;atiable avarice; Caius Laco, whom he had made prefect of the Praetorian bands; and Icelus, his freedman, who a&s;pired at the highe&s;t command in the eque&s;trian or|der. The&s;e three, very different in their di&s;po&s;i|tions, influenced the emperor to oppo&s;ite pur|&s;uits; and only agreed in one point, that of abu&s;ing his confidence. Thus, by the inequa|lity of his conduct, he became de&s;picable to his &s;ubjects. At one time, &s;hewing him&s;elf &s;e|vere and frugal; at another, remi&s;s and pro|digal; condemning &s;ome illu&s;trious per&s;ons, without any hearing; and pardoning others, though guilty: in &s;hort, nothing was done but by the mediation of the&s;e favourites; all offices
<PB N="258" REF="264">
were venal, and all puni&s;hments redeemable by money.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this un&s;ettled po&s;ture at Rome, while the provinces were yet in a wor&s;e condition. The &s;ucce&s;s of the army in Spain, in chu&s;ing an emperor, induced the legions in other parts, to wi&s;h for a &s;imilar opportunity. Accordingly many &s;editions were kindled, and &s;everal factions promoted in different parts of the empire, but particularly in Germany. There were then, in that province, two Roman armies; the one which had lately attempted to make Rufus Virginius emperor, as has been already mentioned, and which was commanded by his lieutenant: the other commanded by Vitellius&punc; who long had an ambition to obtain the empire for him&s;elf. The former of the&s;e armies de|&s;pi&s;ing their pre&s;ent general, and con&s;idering them&s;elves as &s;u&s;pected by the emperor, for having been the la&s;t to acknowledge his title, re&s;olved now to be foremo&s;t in denying it. Ac|cordingly, when they were &s;ummoned to take the oaths of homage and fidelity, they refu&s;ed to acknowledge any other commands but tho&s;e of the &s;enate. This refu&s;al they backed by a me&s;&s;age to the Praetorian bands, importing, that they were re&s;olved not to acquie&s;ce in the elec|tion of an emperor created in Spain, and de&s;iring that the &s;enate &s;hould proceed to a new choice.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="265">
Galba being informed of the&s;e commotions, was &s;en&s;ible, that, be&s;ide his age, he was le&s;s re&s;pected for want of an heir. He re&s;olved, therefore, to put what he had formerly de|&s;igned in execution, and to adopt &s;ome per&s;on, who&s;e virtues might de&s;erve &s;uch advancement, and protect his declining age from danger. His favourites under&s;tanding his determination, in&s;tantly re&s;olved on giving him an heir of their own chu&s;ing, &s;o that there aro&s;e a great contention among them upon this occa&s;ion. Otho made warm application for him&s;elf, al|ledging the great &s;ervices he had done the em|peror, as being the fir&s;t man of note who came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when he had declared again&s;t Nero. However, Galba, being fully re&s;olved to con&s;ult the public good alone, rejected his &s;uit, and on a day appointed ordered Pi&s;o Lucinianus to attend him. The character given by hi&s;to|rians of Pi&s;o is, that he was every way worthy of the honour de&s;igned him. He was no way re|lated to Galba, and had no other intere&s;t but merit, to recommend him to his favour. Taking this youth, therefore, by the hand, in the pre&s;ence of his friends, he adopted him to &s;ucceed in the empire, giving him the mo&s;t whol&s;ome le&s;&s;ons for guiding his future conduct. Pi&s;o's conduct &s;hewed that he was highly de&s;erving this di&s;tinc|tion: in all his deportment there appeared &s;uch mode&s;ty, firmne&s;s and equality of mind, as be|&s;poke
<PB N="260" REF="266">
him rather capable of di&s;charging, than ambitious of obtaining, his pre&s;ent dignity. But the army and the &s;enate did not &s;eem equally di&s;intere&s;ted upon this occa&s;ion; they had been &s;o long u&s;ed to bribery and corruption, that they could now bear no emperor, who was not in a capacity of &s;atisfying their avarice. The adoption, therefore, of Pi&s;o was but cold|ly received, for his virtues were no recom|mendation in a nation of univer&s;al depravity.</P>
<P>Otho now finding his hopes of adoption wholly fru&s;trated, and &s;till further &s;timulated by the immen&s;e load of debt which he had contracted by his riotous way of living, re|&s;olved upon obtaining the empire by force, &s;ince he could not by peaceable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In fact, his circum&s;tances were &s;o very de&s;perate, that he was heard to &s;ay, that it was equal to him whether he fell by his enemies in the field, or by his creditors in the city. He therefore rai&s;ed a moderate &s;um of money, by &s;elling his intere&s;t to a per&s;on who wanted a place, and with this, bribed two &s;ubaltern officers in the Praetorian bands, &s;upplying the deficiency of his large&s;&s;es by promi&s;es and plau&s;ible pretences. Having in this manner, in le&s;s than eight days, cor|rupted the fidelity of the &s;oldiers, he &s;tole &s;e|cretly from the emperor, while he was &s;acri|ficing; and a&s;&s;embling the &s;oldiers, in a &s;hort &s;peech, urged the cruelties, and the avarice of
<PB N="261" REF="267">
Galba. Finding the&s;e his invectives received with univer&s;al &s;houts by the whole army, he entirely threw off the ma&s;k, and avowed his intentions of dethroning him. The &s;oldiers being ripe for &s;edition, immediately &s;econded his views, and taking Otho upon their &s;houl|ders immediately declared him emperor; and, to &s;trike the citizens with terror, carried him, with their &s;words drawn, into the camp.</P>
<P>Galba, in the mean time, being informed of the revolt of the army, &s;eemed utterly con|founded, and in want of &s;ufficient re&s;olution to face an event, which he &s;hould have long fore&s;een. In this manner the poor old man continued wavering and doubtful; till, at la&s;t, being deluded by a fal&s;e report of Otho's being &s;lain, he rode into the forum in complete ar|mour, and attended by many of his followers. Ju&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, a body of hor&s;e, &s;ent from the camp to de&s;troy him, entered on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and each party prepared for the encounter. For &s;ome time ho&s;tilities were &s;u&s;pended on each &s;ide; Galba confu&s;ed and irre&s;olute, and his antagoni&s;ts &s;truck with hor|ror at the ba&s;ene&s;s of their enterprize. At length, however, finding the emperor, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure de&s;erted by his adherents, they ru&s;hed in upon him, trampling the crowds of people that then filled the forum under foot. Galba &s;eeing them approach, &s;eemed to recollect all his
<PB N="262" REF="268">
former fortitude; and bending his head for|ward, bid the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;trike it off, if it were for the good of the people. This was quickly performed; and his head being &s;et upon the point of a launce, was pre&s;ented to Otho, who ordered it to be contemptuou&s;ly carried round the camp; his body remaining unburied in the &s;treets, till it was buried by one of his <MILESTONE N="69" UNIT="A.D."> &s;laves. He died in the &s;eventy-third year of his age, after a &s;hort reign of &s;even months; as illu&s;trious by his own virtues, as it was con|taminated by the vices of his favourites, who &s;hared in his downfall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OTHO, the Eighth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was Galba thus murdered, than the &s;enate and people ran in crowds to the camp, contending who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in extolling the virtues of the new emperor, and depre&s;&s;ing the character of him they had &s;o unju&s;tly de|&s;troyed. Each laboured to excel the re&s;t in his in&s;tances of homage, and the le&s;s his affecti|ons were for him, the more did he indulge all the veheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of exaggerated prai&s;e. Otho finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded by congratulating
<PB N="263" REF="269">
multitudes, immediately repaired to the &s;enate, where he received the titles u&s;ually given to the emperors; and from thence returned to the palace, &s;eemingly re&s;olved to reform his life, and a&s;&s;ume manners becoming the greatne&s;s of his &s;tation.</P>
<P>He began his reign by a &s;ignal in&s;tance of clemency, in pardoning Marius Cel&s;us, who had been highly favoured by Galba; and not con|tented with barely forgiving, he advanced him to the highe&s;t honours; a&s;&s;erting, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fidelity de&s;erved every reward."</Q> This act of cle|mency was followed by another of ju&s;tice, equally agreeable to the people. Tigellinus, Nero's favourite, he who had been the promo|ter of all his cruelties, was now put to death; and all &s;uch as had been unju&s;tly bani&s;hed, or &s;tripped, at his in&s;tigation, during Nero's reign, were re&s;tored to their country and for|tunes.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the legions in Lower Germany having been purcha&s;ed by the large gifts and &s;pecious promi&s;es of Vitellius, their general, were at length induced to proclaim him emperor; and, regardle&s;s of the &s;enate, declared that they had an equal right to appoint to that high &s;tation, with the cohorts at Rome. The news of this conduct in the army, &s;oon &s;pread con&s;ternation throughout Rome; but Otho was particularly &s;truck with the account,
<PB N="264" REF="270">
as being apprehen&s;ive, that nothing but the blood of his countrymen, could decide a conte&s;t, of which his own ambition only was the cau&s;e. Of all characters in hi&s;tory, Otho's &s;eems that alone which was mended by advancement; for we now find Otho, the emperor, very diffe|rent from him&s;elf, when in a private &s;tation; he was, at that time, weak, vicious and de|bauched; but, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, he appears courageous, benevolent and humane. He now, therefore, &s;ought to come to an agreement with Vitellius; but this not &s;uc|ceeding, both &s;ides began their preparations &s;or war. However, all things &s;eemed to be un|favourable to Otho. The chief of the &s;enate were grown old and impotent; the rich men of Rome were indolent and &s;lothful; the knights had long been di&s;&s;olved in ea&s;e and luxury; and the cohorts them&s;elves were relaxed from the military di&s;cipline of their ance&s;tors. News being received that Vitellius was upon his march to Italy, Otho departed from Rome with a va&s;t army to oppo&s;e him. But though he was very powerful, with regard to numbers, his men, being but little u&s;ed to war, could not be relied on. He &s;eemed by his behaviour &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;proportion of his forces; and he is &s;aid to have been tortured with frightful dreams and the mo&s;t boding apprehen&s;ions. It is al&s;o reported by &s;ome, that one night, fetching
<PB N="265" REF="271">
many profound &s;ighs in his &s;leep, his &s;ervants ran ha&s;tily to his bed-&s;ide, and found him &s;tretched on the ground. He alledged, he had &s;een the gho&s;t of Galba, which had, in a threatening manner, beat and pu&s;hed him rude|ly from the bed; and he afterwards u&s;ed many expiations to appea&s;e it. However this be, he proceeded with a great &s;hew of courage, till he arrived at the city of Brixellum, on the river Po, where he remained, &s;ending his forces be|fore him, under the conduct of his generals Suetonius and Cel&s;us, who made what ha&s;te they could to give the enemy battle. The army of Vitellius, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy thou|&s;and men, was commanded by his generals Va|lens and Cecina, he him&s;elf remaining in Gaul, in order to bring up the re&s;t of his forces. Thus both &s;ides ha&s;tened to meet each other with &s;o much animo&s;ity and precipitation, that three con&s;iderable battles were fought in the &s;pace of three days. One near Placentia, ano|ther near Cremona, and a third, at a place call|ed Ca&s;tor; in all which, Otho and the Romans had the advantage. But the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were but of &s;hort-lived continuance, for Valens and Cecinnia, who had hitherto acted &s;eparately, joining their forces, and reinforcing their ar|mies with fre&s;h &s;upplies, re&s;olved to come to a general engagement. Otho, who by this time had joined his army, at a little village called
<PB N="266" REF="272">
Bebriacum, finding the enemy, notwith|&s;tanding their late lo&s;&s;es, inclined to come to a battle, re&s;olved to call a council of war, to determine upon the proper mea&s;ures to be taken. His generals were of opinion to protract the war: but others, who&s;e inexperience had given them cau&s;ele&s;s confidence, declared, that nothing but a battle could relieve the mi&s;eries of the &s;tate; prote&s;ting that Fortune, and all the Gods, with the divinity of the emperor him&s;elf, favoured the de&s;ign, and would, undoubtedly, pro&s;per the enterprize. In this advice Otho acquie&s;ced: he had been for &s;ome time &s;o un|ea&s;y under the war, that he &s;eemed willing to exchange &s;u&s;pen&s;e for danger. However, he was &s;o &s;urrounded by flatterers, that he was prohibited from being per&s;onally pre&s;ent in the engagement, but prevailed upon to re&s;erve him|&s;erve him&s;elf for the fortune of the empire, and wait the event at Brixellum. The affairs of both armies being thus adju&s;ted, they came to an engagement at Bebriacum; where, in the beginning, tho&s;e on the &s;ide of Otho &s;eemed to have the advantage, and at the fir&s;t on&s;et &s;lew all the fir&s;t rank, and won the eagle, which was con&s;idered as a certain pre&s;age of victory. Both armies were extremely encumbered with trees and hedges, &s;o that they were obliged to fight with very little regularity, and the en|gagement &s;eemed a tumultuary oppo&s;ition of
<PB N="267" REF="273">
forces, without a plan, and without a com|mander. At length, however, the &s;uperior di&s;cipline of the legions of Vitellius, turned the &s;cale of victory. They, after &s;ome time, formed them&s;elves from a &s;tate of apparent confu&s;ion, and attacking the enemy in flank, gained a &s;ignal and deci&s;ive victory. Otho's army fled in great confu&s;ion towards Bebriacum, being pur&s;ued with a mi&s;erable &s;laughter all the way.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Otho waited for the news of the battle with great impatience, and &s;eemed to tax his me&s;&s;engers with delay. The fir&s;t ac|count of his defeat was brought him by a com|mon &s;oldier, who had e&s;caped from the field of battle. However, Otho, who was &s;till &s;ur|rounded by flatterers, was de&s;ired to give no credit to a ba&s;e fugitive, who was guilty of fal&s;ehood, only to cover his own cowardice. The &s;oldier, however, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the ve|racity of his report; and, finding none inclined to believe him, immediately fell upon his &s;word, and expired at the emperor's feet. Otho was &s;o much &s;truck with the death of this faithful cen|tinel, that he cried out, that he would cau&s;e the ruin of no more &s;uch valiant and worthy &s;oldiers, but would end the conte&s;t by the &s;horte&s;t way. It was in vain, therefore, that his followers gathered round him, endeavouring to revive his hopes, and in&s;pire him with fre&s;h ambition: in vain did tho&s;e, who were too
<PB N="268" REF="274">
di&s;tant to be heard, lift up their hands to be|&s;eech him; he was deaf to all their intreaties; he had formed a re&s;olution to die, as the only means of ridding him&s;elf of his cares, and his country of its calamities. Having, therefore, given the &s;ignal for &s;peaking, he addre&s;&s;ed the &s;hattered remains of his army with great intre|pidity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I e&s;teem," cried he, "this day, as far more glorious than that of my elec|tion, &s;ince it has convinced me of your fide|lity and affection. I mu&s;t, however, intreat for one favour more; which is, to die, in order to procure your &s;afety: I can never &s;o much advance the intere&s;ts of my country by war and blood, as by &s;acrificing my&s;elf for its peace. Others have purcha&s;ed fame by governing well; let it be my boa&s;t to leave an empire, rather than, by my ambi|tion, to weaken or de&s;troy it."</Q> After &s;peak|ing to this effect, he intreated his followers to yield them&s;elves to Vitellius, and not provoke him by ob&s;tinacy or delay. Then rebuking the unrea&s;onable fears of tho&s;e about him, without any &s;igns of fear, either in his looks or words, he retired to his chamber: there he wrote two con&s;olatory letters to his &s;i&s;ter, and a third to Me&s;&s;alina, whom he had de&s;igned for his wife. He next burnt &s;uch letters and papers as might be prejudicial to his friends, and di&s;tributed &s;ome money and jewels among his friends and
<PB N="269" REF="275">
dome&s;tics. He then prepared to die; but per|ceiving a tumult among the &s;oldiers, who pre|pared to puni&s;h &s;ome that were going privately away; he cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me then add one day more to my life."</Q> Upon which he or|dered his chamber door to be thrown open, and employed the remaining part of the day in hindering the violence of his &s;oldiers, and giving advice to all &s;uch as de&s;ired admittance. Having thus performed the duties of his &s;tation, and having quenched his thir&s;t with a draught of cold water, he ordered the doors to be &s;ecured. He then took two daggers, and having tried and cho&s;en the &s;harpe&s;t, he laid it under his pillow, and fell into a profound &s;leep. Awaking by break of day, he perceived one of his &s;er|vants remaining in the room, whom he com|manded to retire. Then taking the dagger, he gave him&s;elf a mortal blow on the left &s;ide, and with a &s;ingle groan ended his life, after a &s;hort reign of three months and five days. There is &s;omething in the conclu&s;ion of this prince's reign, that &s;eems to atone for the vile methods by which he acquired dominion. His clemency and ju&s;tice, while he continued on the throne, and the calm manner in which he re|&s;igned it, make us almo&s;t regret his wanting an opportunity to di&s;play his newly acquired vir|tues with more permanent lu&s;tre.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP X.  VITELLIUS, the ninth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="70" UNIT="A.D."> IT was no &s;ooner known that Otho had killed him&s;elf, than all the &s;oldiers repaired to Virgi|nius, the commander of the German legions, earne&s;tly intreating him to take upon him the reins of government; or, at lea&s;t, intreating his mediation with the generals of Vitellius in their favour. Upon his declining their reque&s;t, Rubrius Gallus, a per&s;on of con&s;iderable note, immediately undertook their emba&s;&s;y to the ge|nerals of the conquering army, and &s;oon after obtained pardon for all the adherents of Otho.</P>
<P>Vitellius was immediately after declared em|peror by the &s;enate, and received the marks of di&s;tinction, which were now accu&s;tomed to fol|low the appointment of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide. At the &s;ame time, Italy was &s;everely embarra&s;&s;ed by the &s;oldiers, who committed &s;uch outrages, as exceeded all the oppre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t ca|lamitous war. Vitellius, who was yet in Gaul, re&s;olved, before he &s;et out for Rome, to puni&s;h the Praetorian cohorts, who had been the in&s;tru|ments of all the late di&s;turbances in the &s;tate.
<PB N="271" REF="277">
He, therefore, cau&s;ed them to be di&s;armed, and deprived of the name and honour of &s;ol|diers. He ordered al&s;o an hundred and fifty of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t guilty, to be put to death.</P>
<P>The&s;e bright beginnings, however, were &s;oon &s;haded by his vices and extravagance. As he approached towards Rome, he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the towns with all imaginable &s;plendour; his pa&s;&s;age by water was in painted galleys, adorned with garlands of flowers, and profu&s;ely fur|ni&s;hed with the greate&s;t delicacies. In his jour|ney there neither was order nor di&s;cipline among his &s;oldiers; they plundered wherever they came with impunity, and he &s;eemed no way di&s;|plea&s;ed at the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of their behaviour. Upon his arrival on the field where the battle was fought, which put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, ob&s;erving the great number of dead bodies &s;cattered over the plain, men and hor&s;es, confu&s;edly intermixed, putrefying, and taint|ing the air with their &s;tench, he &s;eemed no way &s;hocked at the &s;pectacle; but ob&s;erved to tho&s;e about him, that a dead enemy &s;melt well; and then calling for wine, he drank upon the field, and ordered large quantities to be di&s;tributed among his &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival at Rome, he entered the city, not as a place he came to govern with ju&s;tice, but as a town that was become his own by the laws of conque&s;t. He marched through
<PB N="272" REF="278">
the &s;treets, mounted on hor&s;eback, all in armour, the &s;enate and people going before him as if the captives of his late victory. He the next day made the &s;enate a &s;peech, in which he magnified his own actions, and promi&s;ed them extraordi|nary advantages from his admini&s;tration. He next harangued the people, who being now long accu&s;tomed to flatter all in authority, highly applauded, and ble&s;&s;ed their new em|peror.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his &s;oldiers being per|mitted to &s;atiate them&s;elves in the debaucheries of the city, grew totally unfit for war. The principal affairs of the &s;tate, were managed by the lowe&s;t wretches, whom Fortune, in her capricious moments, &s;eemed plea&s;ed with ex|alting. A&s;iaticus, his freedman, attended by a groupe of players and charioteers, governed all things, and brought virtue into di&s;repute by their example. Vitellius, more abandoned than they, gave him&s;elf up to all kinds of lux|ury and profu&s;ene&s;s; but gluttony was his fa|vourite vice; &s;o that he brought him&s;elf to an habit of vomiting, in order to be able to renew his meals at plea&s;ure. His entertainments, though &s;eldom at his own co&s;t, were prodigi|ou&s;ly expen&s;ive; he frequently invited him&s;elf to the tables of his &s;ubjects, breakfa&s;ting with one, dining with another, and &s;upping with a third, all in the &s;ame day. The mo&s;t memo|rable
<PB N="273" REF="279">
of the&s;e entertainments was, that made for him by his brother, on his arrival at Rome. In this, were &s;erved up two thou&s;and &s;everal di&s;hes of fi&s;h, and &s;even thou&s;and fowl of the mo&s;t valuable kinds. But in one particular di&s;h, he &s;eemed to have outdone all the former pro|fu&s;ion of the mo&s;t luxurious Romans. This di&s;h, which was of &s;uch magnitude as to be called the &s;hield of Minerva, was filled with an olio made from the &s;ounds of the fi&s;h called Scarri, the brains of phea&s;ants and woodcocks, the tongues of the mo&s;t co&s;tly birds, and the &s;pawn of lampreys brought from the Carpa|thian &s;ea. In order to cook this di&s;h properly, a furnace was built in the fields, as it was too large for any kitchen to contain it.</P>
<P>In this manner did this bea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ly creature pro|ceed, &s;pending his time in the mo&s;t gro&s;s &s;en|&s;ualities; &s;o that Jo&s;ephus tells us, that if he had reigned long, the whole empire would not have been &s;ufficient to have maintained his glut|tony. All the attendants of his court &s;ought to rai&s;e them&s;elves, not by their virtue and abi|lities, but the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of their entertain|ments. This prodigality produced its attend|ant, want; and that, in turn, gave ri&s;e to cruelty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had formerly been his a&s;&s;ociates, were now de&s;troyed without mercy. Going to vi&s;it one of them in a violent fever, he mingled

poi&s;on with his water, and delivered it to him with his own hands. He never pardoned tho&s;e money lenders who came to demand payment of his former debts. One of the number coming to &s;alute him, he immediately ordered him to be carried off to execution; but &s;hortly after, commanding him to be brought back, when all his attendants thought it was to pardon the un|happy creditor, Vitellius gave them &s;oon to un|der&s;tand, that it was merely to have the plea&s;ure of feeding his eyes with his torments. Having condemned another to death, he executed his two &s;ons with him, only for their pre&s;uming to intercede for their father. A Roman knight being dragged away to execution, and crying out, that he had made the emperor his heir, Vitellius demanded to &s;ee the will, where find|ing him&s;elf joint heir with another, he ordered both to be executed, that he might enjoy the legacy without a partner.</P>
<P>By the continuance of &s;uch vices and cruel|ties as the&s;e, he became, not only a burthen to him&s;elf, but odious to all mankind. The a&s;tro|logers, a &s;et of people who &s;eldom fail to fore|tell the ruin of one, who&s;e whole &s;tudy it is to become inimical to the world, began by pro|gno&s;ticating his downfall. A writing was &s;et up in the forum to this effect, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We, in the name of the ancient Chaldaeans, give Vitellius warning, to depart this life by the calends

of October."</Q> Vitellius, on his part, received their information with terror, and ordered all the a&s;trologers to be bani&s;hed from Rome. An old woman having foretold, that, if he &s;urvived his mother, he &s;hould reign many years in happine&s;s and &s;ecurity, this gave him a de&s;ire of putting her to death; which he did, by refu&s;ing her &s;u&s;tenance, under pretence of its being prejudi|cial to her health. But he &s;oon &s;aw the futility of relying upon &s;uch vain progno&s;tications; for his &s;oldiers, by their cruelty and rapine, having become in&s;upportable to the inhabitants of Rome, the legions of the ea&s;t, who had at fir&s;t acquie&s;ced in his dominion, began to revolt, and, &s;hortly after, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to make Ve&s;pa&s;ian emperor.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who was appointed command|er again&s;t the rebellious Jews, had reduced mo&s;t of their country, except Jeru&s;alem, to &s;ubjection. The death of Nero, however, had at fir&s;t interrupted the progre&s;s of his arms, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Galba gave a temporary check to his conque&s;ts, as he was obliged to &s;end his &s;on Titus to Rome, to receive that empe|ror's commands. Titus, however, was &s;o long detained by contrary winds, that he received news of Galba's death before he &s;et &s;ail. He then re&s;olved to continue neuter, during the civil wars between Otho and Vitellius; and when the latter prevailed, he gave him his ho|mage
<PB N="276" REF="282">
with reluctance. But being de&s;irous of acquiring reputation, though he di&s;liked the government, he determined to lay &s;iege to Je|ru&s;alem, and actually made preparations for that great undertaking, when he was given to un|der&s;tand, that Vitellius was dete&s;ted by all ranks in the empire. The&s;e murmurings in|crea&s;ed every day, while Ve&s;pa&s;ian &s;ecretly en|deavoured to advance the di&s;contents of his army. By the&s;e means, they began, at length, to fix their eyes upon him, as a per&s;on, the mo&s;t capable and willing to terminate the mi&s;eries of his country, and put a period to the injuries it &s;uffered. Not only the legions under his command, but tho&s;e in Mae&s;ia and Pannonia came to the &s;ame re&s;olution, &s;o that they declared them&s;elves for Ve&s;pa&s;ian. He was al&s;o, without his own con&s;ent, proclaimed emperor at Alexandria, the army there con|firming it with extraordinary applau&s;e, and paying their accu&s;tomed homage. Still, how|ever, Ve&s;pa&s;ian &s;eemed to decline the honours done him; till, at length, his &s;oldiers com|pelled him, with their threats of immediate death, to accept a title, which, in all probabi|lity, he wi&s;hed to enjoy. He now, therefore, called a council of war, where it was re&s;olved, that his &s;on Titus &s;hould carry on the war again&s;t the Jews; and that Mutianus, one of his generals, &s;hould, with the greate&s;t part
<PB N="277" REF="283">
of his legions, enter Italy; while Ve&s;pa&s;ian him&s;elf &s;hould levy forces in all parts of the ea&s;t, in order to reinforce them, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>During the&s;e preparations, Vitellius, though buried in &s;loth and luxury, was re&s;olved to make an effort to defend the empire; where|fore, his chief commanders, Valens and Ce|cinna, were ordered to make all po&s;&s;ible pre|parations to re&s;i&s;t the invaders. The fir&s;t army that entered Italy with an ho&s;tile intention, was under the command of Antonius Primus, who was met by Cecinna near Cremona. A battle was expected to en&s;ue, but a negotiation taking place, Cecinna was prevailed upon to change &s;ides, and declare for Ve&s;pa&s;ian. His army, however, quickly repented of what they had done; and, impri&s;oning their general, at|tacked Antonius, though without a leader. The engagement continued during the whole night, and in the morning, after a &s;hort re|pa&s;t, both armies engaged a &s;econd time; when the &s;oldiers of Antonius &s;aluting the ri&s;ing &s;un, according to cu&s;tom, the Vitellians &s;uppo&s;ing that they had received new reinforce|ments, betook them&s;elves to flight, with the lo&s;s of thirty thou&s;and men. Shortly after, freeing their general Cecinna from pri&s;on, they prevailed upon him to intercede with the con|querors for pardon; which they obtained, tho' not without the mo&s;t horrid barbarities com|mitted
<PB N="278" REF="284">
upon Cremona, the city to which they had retired for &s;helter.</P>
<P>In the mean time Vitellius was wallowing in all kinds of luxury and exce&s;s. However, when informed of the defeat of his army, his former in&s;olence was converted into an ex|treme of timidity and irre&s;olution. At length, rou&s;ing from his lethargy of protracted vice, he commanded Julius Pri&s;cus, and Alphenus Va|rus, with &s;ome forces that were in readine&s;s, to guard the pa&s;&s;es of the Appenines, to prevent the enemy's march to Rome; re&s;erving the principal body of his army, to &s;ecure the city, under the command of his brother Lucius. At length, being per&s;uaded to repair to his army in per&s;on, his pre&s;ence only &s;erved to increa&s;e the contempt of his &s;oldiers. He there appeared irre&s;olute, and &s;till luxurious, without coun&s;el or conduct, ignorant of war, and demanding from others, tho&s;e in&s;tructions which it was his duty to give. After a &s;hort continuance in the camp, and under&s;tanding the revolt of his fleet, he returned once more to Rome, ever fearful of the la&s;t blow, and al|ways carele&s;s as to the principal object of his concern. Every day, however, only &s;erved to render his affairs &s;till more de&s;perate; till, at la&s;t, he made offers to Ve&s;pa&s;ian of re&s;igning the empire, provided his life were granted, and a &s;ufficient revenue for his &s;upport. In
<PB N="279" REF="285">
order to enforce this reque&s;t, he i&s;&s;ued from his palace in deep mourning, with all his dome&s;tics weeping round him. He then went to offer the &s;word of ju&s;tice to Cecilius, the con&s;ul; which he refu&s;ing, the abject emperor prepared to lay down the en&s;igns of empire in the temple of Concord. But being interrupted by &s;ome, who cried out, That he him&s;elf was Concord, he re&s;olved, upon &s;o weak an encouragement, &s;till to maintain his power, and immediately prepared for his defence.</P>
<P>During this fluctuation of coun&s;els, one Sa|binus, who had advi&s;ed Vitellius to re&s;ign, perceiving his de&s;perate &s;ituation, re&s;olved, by a bold &s;tep, to oblige Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and accord|ingly &s;eized upon the Capitol. But he was pre|mature in his attempt; for the &s;oldiers of Vi|tellius attacked him with great fury, and pre|vailing by their numbers, &s;oon laid that beauti|ful building in a&s;hes. During this dreadful conflagration, Vitellius was fea&s;ting in the pa|lace of Tiberius, and beholding all the horrors of the a&s;&s;ault with great &s;atisfaction. Sabinus was taken pri&s;oner, and &s;hortly after executed by the emperor's command. Young Domitian, his nephew, who was afterwards emperor, e&s;caped by flight, in the habit of a prie&s;t; and all the re&s;t who &s;urvived the fire were put to the &s;word.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="286">
But this tran&s;ient gleam of &s;ucce&s;s &s;erved little to improve the affairs of Vitellius; he vainly &s;ent me&s;&s;enger after me&s;&s;enger, to bring Ve&s;pa&s;ian's general, Antonius, to a compo&s;ition: this commander, however, gave no an&s;wer to his reque&s;ts, but &s;till continued his march to|wards Rome. Being arrived before the walls of the city, the forces of Vitellius were re&s;olved upon defending it to the utmo&s;t extremity. It was attacked, on three &s;ides, with the utmo&s;t fury; while the army within, &s;allying upon the be&s;iegers, defended it with equal ob&s;tinacy. The battle la&s;ted a whole day, till, at la&s;t, the be&s;ieged were driven into the city&punc; and a dread|ful &s;laughter made of them in all the &s;treets, which they vainly attempted to defend. In the mean time, the citizens &s;tood by, looking on as both &s;ides fought; and, as if they had been in a theatre, clapped their hands; at one time encouraging one party, and again the other. As either turned their backs, the citizens would then fall upon them in their places of refuge, and &s;o kill and plunder them without mercy. But what was &s;till more remarkable, during the&s;e dreadful &s;laughters, both within and without the city, the people would not be prevented from celebrating one of their mo&s;t riotous fea&s;ts, called the Saturnalia; &s;o that at one t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e might have been &s;een a &s;trange mix|ture of mirth and mi&s;ery, of cruelty and lewd|ne&s;s;

<P>During this complicated &s;cene of mi&s;ery, Vi|tellius, who had been the cau&s;e of it all, retired privately to his wife's hou&s;e, upon mount Aven|tine&punc; de&s;igning that night to fly to the army com|manded by his brother at Tarracina. But, quite incapable, through fear, of forming any re&s;olu|tion, he changed his mind, and returned again to his palace, now void and de&s;olate; all his &s;laves now for&s;aking him in his di&s;tre&s;s, and purpo&s;ely avoiding his pre&s;ence. There, after wandering for &s;ome time, quite di&s;con&s;olate, and fearing the face of every creature, he met he hid him&s;elf in an ob&s;cure corner, from whence he was &s;oon taken by a party of the conquering &s;oldiers. Still, however, willing to add a few hours more to his mi&s;erable life, he begged to be kept in pri&s;on till the arrival of Ve&s;pa&s;ian at Rome, pretending that he had &s;e|crets of importance to di&s;cover. But his in|treaties were vain: the &s;oldiers binding his hands behind him, and throwing an halter round his neck, led him along, half naked, into the public forum, upbraiding him, as they pro|ceeded,
<PB N="282" REF="288">
with all tho&s;e bitter reproaches their malice could &s;ugge&s;t, or his own cruelty could de&s;erve. They al&s;o tied his hair backwards, as was u&s;ual with the mo&s;t infamous malefactors, and held the point of a &s;word under his chin, to prevent his hiding his face from the public. Some ca&s;t dirt and filth upon him as he pa&s;&s;ed, others &s;truck him with their hands; &s;ome ridi|culed the defects of his per&s;on, his red fiery face, and the enormous greatne&s;s of his belly. At length, being come to the place of puni&s;hment, they killed him with many blows; and then dragging the dead body through the &s;treets with an hook, they threw it, with all po&s;&s;ible igno|miny, into the river Tyber. Such was the me|rited end of this brutal emperor, in the fifty-&s;eventh year of his age, after a &s;hort reign of eight months and five days; &s;o that Plutarch compares this emperor, and his two predece&s;&s;ors&punc; to the kings in tragedies, who ju&s;t appear upon the &s;tage, and then are de&s;troyed. Vitellius &s;eemed the only tyrant who entered upon his command with cruelty. Nero and Caligula gave the beginnings of their reign to mercy and ju&s;tice; but this mon&s;ter was fir&s;t advanced for his vices, began his gvernment with cruelty, continued it with univer&s;al dete&s;tation, and died to the &s;atisfaction of all mankind.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="70" UNIT="A.D."> VITELLIUS being now no more, the  conquering army pur&s;ued their enemies through|out the whole city, while neither hou&s;es nor temples afforded refuge to the fugitives. The &s;treets and public places were all &s;trewed with dead, each man lying &s;lain where it was his misfortune to be overtaken by his unmerciful pur&s;uers. But not only the enemy &s;uffered in this manner, but many of the citizens, who were obnoxious to the &s;oldiers, were dragged from their hou&s;es, and killed without any form or trial. The heat of their re&s;entment being &s;omewhat abated, they next began to &s;eek for plunder; and, under pretence of &s;earching for the enemy, left no place without marks of their rage or rapacity. Be&s;ides the &s;oldiers, the lower rabble joined in the&s;e dete&s;table outrages; &s;ome of the ba&s;e&s;t &s;laves came and di&s;covered the riches of their ma&s;ters; &s;ome were detected by their neare&s;t friends; the whole city was filled with outcry and lamentation; in&s;omuch, that the former ravages of Otho and Vitellius were now con&s;idered as &s;light evils in compari&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="290">
At length, however, upon the arrival of Mutianus, general to Ve&s;pa&s;ian, the&s;e &s;laugh|ters cea&s;ed, and the &s;tate began to wear an ap|pearance of former tranquility. Ve&s;pa&s;ian was declared emperor, by the unanimous con&s;ent, both of the &s;enate and the army; and dignified with all tho&s;e titles, which now followed rather the power, than the merit, of tho&s;e who were appointed to govern. Me&s;&s;engers were di&s;|patched to him into Egypt, de&s;iring his return, and te&s;tifying the utmo&s;t de&s;ire for his govern|ment. However, the winter being dangerous for &s;ailing, he deferred his voyage to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on. Perhaps, al&s;o, the di&s;&s;en|&s;ions in other parts of the empire retarded his return to Rome; for Claudius Civilis, in Lower Germany, excited his countrymen to revolt, and de&s;troyed the Roman garri&s;ons, which were placed in different parts of that province. However, to give his rebellion an air of ju&s;tice, he cau&s;ed his army to &s;wear allegiance to Ve&s;|pa&s;ian, until he found him&s;elf in a condition to throw off the ma&s;k. When he thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently powerful, he di&s;claimed all &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Roman government, and having overcome one or two of the lieutenants of the empire, and being joined by &s;uch of the Ro|mans, as refu&s;ed obedience to the new empe|peror, he boldly advanced to give Cerealis, Ve&s;pa&s;ian's general, battle. In the beginning
<PB N="285" REF="291">
of this engagement, he &s;eemed &s;ucce&s;sful, breaking the Roman legions, and putting their cavalry to flight. But, at length, Cerealis, by his conduct, turned the fate of the day, and not only routed the enemy, but took and de|&s;troyed their camp. This engagement, how|ever, was not deci&s;ive; &s;everal others en&s;ued with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s. An accommodation, at length, determined what arms could not effect. Civilis obtained peace for his countrymen, and pardon for him&s;elf; for the Roman empire was, at this time, &s;o torn by its own divi&s;ions, that the barbarous nations around made incur|&s;ions with impunity, and were &s;ure of obtaining peace, whenever they thought proper to de|mand it.</P>
<P>During the time of the&s;e commotions in Germany, the Sarmatians, a barbarous nation to the north-ea&s;t of the empire, &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;ed the river I&s;ter, and marched into the Roman dominions with &s;uch celerity and fury, as to de|&s;troy &s;everal garri&s;ons, and an army under the command of Fonteius Agrippa. However, they were driven back, with &s;ome &s;laughter, by Rubrius Gallus, Ve&s;pa&s;ian's lieutenant, into their native fore&s;ts; where &s;everal attempts were made to confine them by garri&s;ons, and forts, placed along the confines of their coun|try. But the&s;e hardy nations, having once found the way into the empire, never after de|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="286" REF="292">
from invading it upon every opportunity&punc; till, at length, they over-ran and de&s;troyed the glory of Rome.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pa&s;ian continued &s;ome months at Alexan|dria, in Egypt, where, it is &s;aid, he cured a blind and alame man by touching them. Before he &s;et out for Rome, he gave his &s;on Titus the command of the army that was to lay &s;iege to Jeru&s;alem; while he him&s;elf went forward, and was met many miles from Rome by all the &s;e|nate, and near half the inhabitants, who gave the &s;incere&s;t te&s;timonies of their joy, in having an emperor of &s;uch great and experienced vir|tues. Nor did he, in the lea&s;t, di&s;appoint their expectations; being equally a&s;&s;iduous in re|warding merit, and pardoning his adver&s;aries; in reforming the manners of the citizens, and &s;etting them the be&s;t example in his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Titus carried on the war again&s;t the Jews with vigour. This ob&s;tinate and infatuated people had long re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t the Roman power, vainly hoping to find pro|tection from Heaven, which their impieties had utterly offended. Their own hi&s;torian repre|&s;ents them, as arrived at the highe&s;t pitch of iniquity; while famines, earthquakes and pro|digies, all con&s;pired to forewarn their approach|ing ruin. Nor was it &s;ufficient that Heaven and earth &s;eemed combined again&s;t them, they had the mo&s;t bitter di&s;&s;en&s;ions among them&s;elves,
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and were &s;plit into two parties, that robbed and de&s;troyed each other with impunity, &s;till pil|laging and, at the &s;ame time, boa&s;ting their zeal for the religion of their an ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>At the head of one of the&s;e parties was an incendiary, who&s;e name was John. This fa|natic affected &s;overeign power, and filled the whole city of Jeru&s;alem, and all the towns around, with tumult and pillage. In a &s;hort time, a new faction aro&s;e, headed by one Si|mon, who gathering together multitudes of robbers and murderers, who had fled to the mountains, attacked many cities and towns, and reduced all Idumea into his power. Jeru|&s;alem, at length, became the theatre, in which the&s;e two demagogues began to exerci&s;e their mutual animo&s;ity; John was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the temple, while Simon was admitted into the city; both equally enraged again&s;t each other, while &s;laughter and deva&s;tation followed their preten&s;ions. Thus did a city, formerly cele|brated for peace an unity, become the &s;eat of tumult and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> was in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation, that Titus came to &s;it down before it with his conquering army, and began his operations within about &s;ix furlongs of the place. It was at the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, when the place was filled with an infinite multitude of people who had come from all parts, to celebrate that great &s;olemnity, that Titus undertook to be&s;iege it. His pre|&s;ence
<PB N="288" REF="294">
produced a temporary reconciliation be|tween the contending factions within; &s;o that they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, to oppo&s;e the common enemy fir&s;t, and then decide their dome&s;tic quarrels at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on. Their fir&s;t &s;ally, which was made with much fury and re&s;olution, put the Romans in great di&s;order, and obliged them to abandon their camp, and fly to the mountains. However, rallying immediately after, the Jews were forced back into the city; while Titus, in per&s;on, &s;hewed &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of valour and con|duct.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages over the Romans only re|newed in the be&s;ieged, their de&s;ires of private vengeance. A tumult en&s;ued in the temple, in which &s;everal of both parties were &s;lain; and in this manner, upon every remi&s;&s;ion from without, the factions of John and Simon vio|lently raging again&s;t each other, agreed only in their re&s;olution to defend the city again&s;t the Romans.</P>
<P>Jeru&s;alem was &s;trongly fortified by three walls on every &s;ide except where it was fenced by deep vallies. Titus began by battering down the out|ward wall, which, after much fatigue and danger, he effected; all the time &s;hewing the greate&s;t clemency to the Jews, and offering them repeat|ed a&s;&s;urances of pardon. But this infatuated people refu&s;ed his proferred kindne&s;s with con|tempt,
<PB N="289" REF="295">
and imputed his humanity to his fears. Five days after, Titus broke through the &s;e|cond wall, and, though driven back by the be&s;ieged, he recovered his ground, and made preparations for battering the third wall, which was their la&s;t defence. But fir&s;t he &s;ent in Jo|&s;ephus, their countryman, to exhort them to yield, who, u&s;ing all his eloquence to per&s;uade them, was only reviled with &s;coffs and re|proaches. The &s;iege was now, therefore, car|ried on with greater vigour than before; &s;everal batteries for engines were rai&s;ed, which were no &s;ooner built, than de&s;troyed by the enemy. At length, it was re&s;olved in council, to &s;urround the whole city with a trench, and thus prevent all relief and &s;uccours from abroad. This, which was quickly executed, &s;eemed no way to intimidate the Jews. Though famine and pe&s;tilence, its nece&s;&s;ary attendant, began now to make the mo&s;t horrid ravages within the walls, yet this de&s;perate people &s;till re&s;olved to hold out. Though obliged to live upon the mo&s;t &s;canty and unwhol&s;ome food, though a bu&s;hel of corn was &s;old for &s;ix hundred crowns, and the holes and &s;ewers were ran&s;acked for car|ca&s;es, that had long &s;ince grown putrid, yet they were not to be moved. The famine raged at la&s;t to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that a woman of di|&s;tinction in the city, boiled her own child to eat it; which horrid account, when it came to
<PB N="290" REF="296">
the ears of Titus, he declared that he would bury &s;o abominable a crime in the ruins of their &s;tate. He now, therefore, cut down all the woods within a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of the city, and cau&s;ing more batteries to be rai&s;ed, he, at length, battered down the wall, and in five days entered the citadel by force. Thus reduced to the very verge of ruin, they &s;till de|ceived them&s;elves with ab&s;urd and fal&s;e expecta|tions, while many fal&s;e prophets deluded the multitude, declaring, they &s;hould &s;oon have a&s;&s;i&s;tance from God. The heat of the battle was now, therefore, gathered round the inner wall of the temple, while the defendants de&s;|perately re&s;i&s;ted from the top. Titus was will|ing to &s;ave this beautiful &s;tructur; ebut a &s;oldier ca&s;ting a brand into &s;ome adjacent buildings, the fire communicated to the temple, and, not|with&s;tanding the utmo&s;t endeavours on both &s;ides, the whole edifice was quickly con&s;umed. The &s;ight of this in ruins effectually &s;erved to damp the ardour of the Jews. They now be|gan to perceive, that Heaven had for&s;aken them, while their cries and lamentations ec|choed from the adjacent mountains. Even tho&s;e who were almo&s;t expiring, lifted up their dying eyes to bewail the lo&s;s of their temple, which they valued more than life it&s;elf. The mo&s;t re&s;olute, however, &s;till endeavoured to defend the upper and &s;tronger part of the city, named
<PB N="291" REF="297">
Sion; but Titus, with his batrering engines, &s;oon made him&s;elf entire ma&s;ter of the place. John and Simon were taken from the vaults where they had concealed them&s;elves; the former was condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment, and the latter re&s;erved to grace the conqueror's triumph. The greate&s;t part of the populace were put to the &s;word, and the city was entirely razed by the plough; &s;o that, according to our Saviour's prophecy, not one &s;tone remained upon another. Thus, after a &s;iege of &s;ix months, this noble city was totally de&s;troyed, having flouri&s;hed, under the peculiar protection of Heaven, above two thou&s;and years. The numbers who peri&s;hed in this &s;iege, according to Jo&s;ephus, amounted to above a million of &s;ouls, and the captives to almo&s;t an hundred thou&s;and. The temporal &s;tate of the Jews ended with their city; while the wretched &s;ur|vivors were bani&s;hed, &s;old, and di&s;per&s;ed into all parts of the world.</P>
<P>His &s;oldiers would have crowned Titus as conqueror, but he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed the honour, alledging, that he was only an in&s;trument in the hand of Heaven, that manife&s;tly declared its wrath again&s;t the Jews. At Rome, however, all mens mouths were filled with the prai&s;es of the conqueror, who had not only &s;hewed him&s;elf an excellent general, but a courageous combatant: his return, therefore, in triumph, which he did
<PB N="292" REF="298">
with his father&punc; was marked by all the magni|ficence and joy that was in the power of men to expre&s;s. All things that were e&s;teemed valuable or beautiful among men, were brought to adorn this great occa&s;ion. Among the rich &s;poils, were expo&s;ed va&s;t quantities of gold, taken out of the temple; but the book of their law was not the lea&s;t remarkable among the magnificent profu&s;ion. This was the fir&s;t time that ever Rome &s;aw the father and the &s;on triumph to|gether. A triumphal arch was erected upon this occa&s;ion, on which were de&s;cribed all the victories of Titus over the Jews, which remains almo&s;t entire to this very day. Ve&s;pa&s;ian like|wi&s;e built a temple to Peace, wherein were de|po&s;ited mo&s;t of the Jewi&s;h &s;poils; and having now calmed all the commotions in every part of the empire, he &s;hut up the temple of Janus, which had been open about five or &s;ix years.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pa&s;ian having thus given &s;ecurity and peace to the empire, re&s;olved to correct num|berle&s;s abu&s;es, which had grown up under the tyranny of his predece&s;&s;ors. To effect this with greater ea&s;e, he joined Titus with him in the con&s;ul&s;hip and tribunitial power; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, admitted him a partner in all the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate. He began with re&s;training the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the army, and forcing them back to their pri&s;tine di&s;cipline. He ordered a young officer to be broke for
<PB N="293" REF="299">
being perfumed, declaring he had rather he had &s;tunk of garlick. Some military me&s;|&s;engers de&s;iring money to buy &s;hoes, he or|dered them for the future to perform their jour|nies barefoot. He was not le&s;s &s;trict with re|gard to the &s;enators and the knights. He turned out &s;uch as were a di&s;grace to their &s;tation, and &s;upplied their places with the mo&s;t worthy men he could find. He abridged the proce&s;&s;es that had been carried to an unrea&s;onable length in the courts of ju&s;tice. He took care to re-edify &s;uch parts of the city as had &s;uffered in the late commotions; particularly the Capitol, which had been lately burnt; and which he now re|&s;tored to more than former magnificence. He likewi&s;e built a famous amphitheatre, the ruins of which are to this day an evidence of its an|cient grandeur. The other ruinous cities in the empire, al&s;o &s;hared his paternal care; he im|proved &s;uch as were declining, adorned others, and built many a-new. In &s;uch acts as the&s;e, he pa&s;t a long reign of clemency and mode|ration; &s;o that it is &s;aid, no man &s;uffered by an unju&s;t or a &s;evere decree, during his admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>Julius Sabinus &s;eems to be the only per&s;on who was treated with greater rigour than was u&s;ual with this emperor. Sabinus, as was ju&s;t mentioned before, was commander of a &s;mall army in Gaul, and had declared him&s;elf emperor&punc;
<PB N="294" REF="300">
upon the death of Vitellius. However, his army was &s;hortly after overcome by Ve&s;pa&s;ian's general, and he him&s;elf compelled to &s;eek &s;afety by flight. He for &s;ome time wandered through the Roman provinces, without being di&s;co|vered; but finding the pur&s;uit every day become clo&s;er, he was obliged to hide him&s;elf in a cave, in which he remained concealed for no le&s;s than nine years, attended all the time by his faithful wife Epponina, who provided provi&s;ions for his &s;upport by day, and repaired to him in the night. However, &s;he was at length di&s;|covered in the performance of this pious office, and Sabinus was taken pri&s;oner, and carried to Rome. Several interce&s;&s;ions were made to the emperor in his behalf; Epponina her&s;elf ap|pearing, with her two children, and imploring her hu&s;band's pardon. However, neither her tears nor entreaties could prevail; Sabinus had been too dangerous a rival for mercy; &s;o that, though &s;he and her children were &s;pared, her hu&s;band &s;uffered by the executioner.</P>
<P>But this &s;eems to be the only in&s;tance in which he re&s;ented pa&s;t offences. He cau&s;ed the daughter of Vitellius, his avowed enemy, to be married into a noble family; and he him&s;elf provided her a &s;uitable fortune. One of Nero's &s;ervants coming to beg for pardon for having once rudely thru&s;t him out of the palace, and in&s;ulting him when in office, Ve&s;pa&s;ian only took
<PB N="295" REF="301">
his revenge by &s;erving him ju&s;t in the &s;ame man|ner. When any plot or con&s;piracies were formed again&s;t him, he di&s;dained to puni&s;h the guilty; &s;aying, That they de&s;erved rather his contempt for their ignorance, than his re&s;ent|ment; as they &s;eemed to envy him a dignity of which he daily experienced the unea&s;ine&s;s. When he was &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;ed to beware of Metius Pompo&s;ianus, again&s;t whom there was &s;trong cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, he rai&s;ed him to the dignity of con&s;ul; adding, That the time would come when he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of &s;o great a be|nefit.</P>
<P>His liberality towards the encouragement of arts and learning, was not le&s;s than his cle|mency. He &s;ettled a con&s;tant &s;alary of an hundred thou&s;and &s;e&s;terces upon the teachers of rhetorick. He was particularly favourable to Jo&s;ephus, the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian. Quinctilian, the orator, and Pliny, the naturali&s;t, flouri&s;hed in his reign, and were highly e&s;teemed by the emperor. He was no le&s;s an encourager of all other excellencies in art; and invited the greate&s;t ma&s;ters and artificers from all parts of the world, making them con&s;iderable pre&s;ents, as he found occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet all his numerous acts of genero&s;ity and magnificence, could not pre&s;erve his character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice. He revived many ob&s;olete methods of taxation;
<PB N="296" REF="302">
and even bought and &s;old commodities him&s;elf, in order to encrea&s;e his fortune. He is charged with advancing the mo&s;t avaricious governors to the provinces, in order to &s;hare their plunder on their return to Rome. He de&s;cended to &s;ome very unu&s;ual and di&s;honourable impo&s;ts, even to the laying a tax upon urine. When his &s;on Titus remon&s;trated the meanne&s;s of &s;uch a tax, Ve&s;pa&s;ian taking a piece of money, demanded if the &s;mell offended him; and then added, that this very money was produced by urine. But the avarice of princes is generally a virtue when their own expences are but few. The exchequer, when Ve&s;pa&s;ian came to the throne, was &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that he informed the &s;enate that it would require a &s;upply of three hundred millions (of our money) to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the com|monwealth. This nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t naturally pro|duce more numerous and heavy taxations than the empire had hitherto experienced; but while the provinces were thus obliged to contribute to the &s;upport of his power, he took every pre|caution to provide for their &s;afety; &s;o that we find but two in&s;urrections in this reign.</P>
<P>In the fourth year of his reign, Antiochus, king of Comagena&punc; holding a private corre|&s;pondence with the Parthians, the declared ene|mies of Rome, was taken pri&s;oner in Cilicia, by Poetus, the governor, and &s;ent bound to Rome. But Ve&s;pa&s;ian generou&s;ly prevented
<PB N="297" REF="303">
all ill treatment towards him, by giving him a re&s;idence at Lacedaemon, and allowing him a re|venue &s;uitable to his dignity. </P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="73" UNIT="A.D."> About the &s;ame time al&s;o, the Alani, a bar|barous  people, inhabiting along the river Ta|nais&punc; abandoned their barren wilds, and invaded the kingdom of Media. From thence, pa&s;&s;ing like a torrent into Armenia, after great rava|ges, they overthrew Tirridates, the king of that country, with prodigious &s;laughter. Titus was at length &s;ent to cha&s;ti&s;e their in&s;olence, and relieve a king that was in alliance with Rome. However, the barbarians retired at the approach of the Roman army, loaden with plunder; be|ing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure compelled to wait a more favourable opportunity of renewing their ir|ruptions.</P>
<P>The&s;e incur&s;ions, however, were but as a tran&s;ient &s;torm, the effects of which were &s;oon repaired by the emperor's moderation and a&s;&s;i|duity. We are told, that he new formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed a thou&s;and nations, which had &s;carcely before amounted to two hundred. No provinces in the empire lay out of his view and protection. He had, during his whole reign, a particular regard to Britain; his generals, Pe|tilius Cerealis, and Julius Frontinus, brought the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land into &s;ubjection; and Agricola, who &s;ucceeded &s;oon after, com|pleated what they had begun.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="304">
Such long and uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s no way encrea&s;ed this emperor's vanity. He ever &s;eemed aver&s;e to tho&s;e &s;welling titles which the &s;enate and people were con&s;tantly offering him. When the king of Parthia, in one of his let|ters, &s;tyled him&s;elf king of kings, Ve&s;pa&s;ian, in his an&s;wer, only called him&s;elf &s;imply Flavius Ve&s;pa&s;ian. He was &s;o far from attempting to hide the meanne&s;s of his original, that he fre|quently mentioned it in company; and when &s;ome flatterers were for deriving his pedigree from Hercules, he de&s;pi&s;ed and derided the meanne&s;s of their adulation. In this manner, having reigned ten years, loved by his &s;ubjects, and de&s;erving their affection, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by an indi&s;po&s;ition at Campania, which he at once declared would be fatal, crying out, in the &s;pirit of Pagani&s;m, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Methinks I am going to be a God."</Q> Removing from thence to the city, and afterwards to a country &s;eat near Reate, he was there taken with a flux, which brought him to the la&s;t extremity. However, perceiving his end approach, and ju&s;t going to expire, he cried out, that an emperor ought to die &s;tanding; wherefore, rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his feet, he expired in the hands of tho&s;e that &s;u&s;tained him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. TITUS, the eleventh EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="79" UNIT="A.D."> TITUS being joyfully received as emperor,  notwith&s;tanding a &s;light oppo&s;ition from his  brother Domitian, who maintained that he him|&s;elf was appointed, and that Titus had fal&s;ified the will, began his reign with the practice of every virtue that became an emperor and a man. During the life of his father, there had been many imputations again&s;t him, both for cruelty, lu&s;t, and prodigality; but upon his exal|tation to the throne, he &s;eemed entirely to take leave of his former vices, and became an ex|ample of the greate&s;t moderation and humanity. His fir&s;t &s;tep towards gaining the affections of his &s;ubjects, was his moderating his pa&s;&s;ions, and bridling his &s;trong inclinations. He had long loved Berenice, &s;i&s;ter to Agrippa, king of Judaea, a woman of the greate&s;t beauty, and refined allurements. But knowing that the connection with her was entirely di&s;agreeable to the people of Rome, he gained a victory over his affections, and &s;ent her away, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="300" REF="306">
their mutual pa&s;&s;ion, and the many arts &s;he u&s;ed to induce him to change his re&s;olutions. He next di&s;carded all tho&s;e, who had been the former mini&s;ters of his plea&s;ures, and forbore to countenance the companions of his loo&s;er recreations, though he had formerly taken great pains in the &s;election. This moderation, added to his ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity, procured him the love of all good men, and the appel|lation of The Delight of Mankind; which all his actions &s;eem calculated to en&s;ure.</P>
<P>As he came to the throne with all the advan|tage of his father's popularity, he was re&s;olved to u&s;e every method to increa&s;e it. He, there|fore, took particular care to puni&s;h all informers, fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and promoters of di&s;&s;ention. Tho&s;e wretches, who had their ri&s;e in the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and impunity of former reigns, were now become &s;o numerous, that their crimes called loudly for puni&s;hment. Of the&s;e, therefore, he daily made public examples; condemning them to be &s;courged in the mo&s;t public &s;treets; next to be dragged through the theatre, and then to be bani&s;hed to the uninha|bited parts of the empire, or &s;old as &s;laves. He exhibited al&s;o many &s;hews, which were very &s;umptuous and magnificent. He, in one day, cau&s;ed five thou&s;and wild bea&s;ts to be bated in the amphitheatre, for the entertainment of the people. The&s;e public rejoicings were con|tinued
<PB N="301" REF="307">
for an hundred days together; during which, he permitted the people to dictate the manner in which they &s;hould chu&s;e to be enter|tained. His courte&s;y and readine&s;s to do good, have been celebrated even by chri&s;tian writers; his principal rule being, never to &s;end any peti|tioner di&s;&s;atisfied away. One night, recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial to mankind the day preceding, he cried out, among his friends, <Q REND="inline">"I have lo&s;t a day."</Q> A &s;entence too remarkable not to be univer&s;ally known.</P>
<P>He was &s;o tender of the lives of his &s;ub|jects, that he took upon him the office of pon|tifex maximus, or high prie&s;t, to keep his hands undefiled with blood. He &s;o little re|garded &s;uch as cen&s;ured or abu&s;ed him, that he was heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I do nothing worthy of cen&s;ure, why &s;hould I be di&s;plea&s;ed at it?"</Q> He was even heard to affirm, that he had ra|ther die him&s;elf than put another to death. Learning that two noblemen had con&s;pired again&s;t him, he readily forgave them, and the next day placing them next him&s;elf in the the|atre, he put the &s;words with which the gladi|ators fought into their hands, demanding their judgment and approbation, whether they were of &s;ufficient &s;hortne&s;s. He pardoned his bro|ther Domitian in the &s;ame manner, who had actually prepared all things for an open re|bellion.</P>

In this reign, an irruption of mount Ve&s;uvius did con&s;iderable damage, overwhelming many towns, and &s;ending its a&s;hes into countries more than an hundred miles di&s;tance. Upon this memorable occa&s;ion, Pliny, the naturali&s;t, lo&s;t his life; for being impelled by too eager a curi|o&s;ity to ob&s;erve the eruption, he was &s;uffocated in the flames. There happened al&s;o about this time a fire at Rome, which continued three days and nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, which was followed by a plague, in which ten thou&s;and men were bu|ried in a day. The emperor, however, did all that lay in his power to repair the damage &s;u&s;|tained by the public; and, with re&s;pect to the city, declared that he would take the whole lo&s;s of that upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, counterbalanced by the &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Britain, under Agricola. This excellent general having been &s;ent into that country towards the latter end of Ve&s;pa&s;ian's reign, &s;hewed him&s;elf equally expert in quelling the refractory, and civilizing tho&s;e who had formerly &s;ubmitted to the Ro|man power. The Ordovices, or inhabitants of North Wales, were the fir&s;t that were &s;ubdued. He then made a de&s;cent upon Mona, or the i&s;land of Angle&s;ey, which &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion. Having thus rendered him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole country, he took every method to re&s;tore di&s;cipline to his own army, and to
<PB N="303" REF="309">
introduce &s;ome &s;hare of politene&s;s among tho&s;e whom he had conquered. He exhorted them, both by advice and example, to build temples, theatres and &s;tately hou&s;es. He cau&s;ed the &s;ons of their nobility to be in&s;tructed in the liberal arts; he had them taught the Latin language, and induced them to immitate the Roman modes of dre&s;&s;ing and living. Thus, by degrees, this barbarous people began to a&s;&s;ume the luxurious manners of their conquerors, and, in &s;ome time, even to outdo them, in all the refinements of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. For the &s;ucce&s;s in Britain, Titus was &s;aluted emperor the fifteenth time; but he did not long &s;urvive his honours, being &s;urpri&s;ed by a violent fever at a little di&s;tance from Rome. Perceiving his death approach, he declared, that, during the whole cour&s;e of his life, he knew but of one action which he repented of; but that action he did not think proper to expre&s;s. Shortly after he died, not without &s;u&s;picion of treachery from his brother Domitian, who had long wi&s;hed to govern, in the forty-fir&s;t year of his age, having reigned two years, two months and twenty days.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.  DOMITIAN, the Twelfth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="81" UNIT="A.D."> THE love which all ranks of people bore to Titus, facilitated the election of his brother Domitian, notwith&s;tanding the ill opinion many had already conceived of him. His ambition was already but too well known, and his pride &s;oon appeared upon his coming to the throne; having been heard to declare, that he had given the empire to his father and brother, and now received it again as his due.</P>
<P>The beginning of his reign was univer&s;ally acceptable to the people, as he appeared equally remarkable for his clemency, liberality and ju&s;tice. He carried his abhorrence of cru|elty &s;o far, as, at one time, to forbid the &s;acri|ficing of oxen. His liberality was &s;uch, that he would not accept of the legacies that were left him by &s;uch as had children of their own. His ju&s;tice was &s;uch, that he would &s;it whole days, and rever&s;e the partial &s;entences of the ordinary judges. He appeared very careful and liberal in repairing the libraries which had been burnt, and recovering copies of &s;uch
<PB N="305" REF="311">
books as had been lo&s;t, &s;ending purpo&s;ely to Alexandria to tran&s;cribe and correct them.</P>
<P>But he &s;oon began to &s;hew the natural defor|mity of his mind. In&s;tead of cultivating lite|rature, as his father and brother had done, he neglected all kinds of &s;tudy, addicting him&s;elf wholly to meaner pur&s;uits, particularly archery and gaming. He was &s;o very expert an archer, that he would frequently cau&s;e one of his &s;laves to &s;tand at a great di&s;tance, with his hand &s;pread as a mark, and would &s;hoot his arrows with &s;uch exactne&s;s, as to &s;tick them all between his fingers. He in&s;tituted three &s;orts of con|te&s;ts to be ob&s;erved every five years; in mu&s;ic, hor&s;eman&s;hip and wre&s;tling; but at the &s;ame time he bani&s;hed all philo&s;ophers and mathematicians from Rome. No emperor before him enter|tained the people with &s;uch various and expen|&s;ive &s;hows. During the&s;e diver&s;ions he di&s;tri|buted great rewards, &s;itting as pre&s;ident him|&s;elf, adorned with a purple robe and crown, with the prie&s;ts of Jupiter, and the college of Flavian prie&s;ts about him. The meanne&s;s of his occupations in &s;olitude, were a ju&s;t contra&s;t to his exhibitions of public o&s;tentation. He u&s;ually &s;pent his hours of retirement in catching flies, and &s;ticking them through with a bod|kin; &s;o that one of his &s;ervants being a&s;ked, if the emperor were alone; he an&s;wered, that
<PB N="306" REF="312">
he had not &s;o much as a fly to bear him com|pany.</P>
<P>His vices &s;eemed every day to encrea&s;e with the duration of his reign; and as he thus be|came more odious to his people, all their mur|murs only &s;erved to add &s;trength to his &s;u&s;pi|cions, and malice to his cruelty. His ungrate|ful treatment of Agricola &s;eemed the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of his natural malevolence. Do|mitian was always particularly fond of obtain|ing a military reputation, and therefore jealous of it in others. He had marched &s;ome time before into Gaul upon a pretended expedition again&s;t the Catti, a people of Germany; and, without ever &s;eeing the enemy, re&s;olved to have the honour of a triumph upon his return to Rome. For that purpo&s;e he purcha&s;ed a num|ber of &s;laves, whom he dre&s;t in German habits, and at the head of this mi&s;erable proce&s;&s;ion en|tered the city amid&s;t the apparent acclamations and concealed contempt of all his &s;ubjects. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es therefore of Agricola in Britain, affected him with an extreme degree of envy. This admirable general, who is &s;carce men|tioned by any other writer except Tacitus, pur|&s;ued the advantages which he had already ob|tained. He &s;ubdued the Caledonians, and overcame Galgacus, the Briti&s;h chief, at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, and afterwards &s;ending out a fleet to &s;cour the coa&s;t, fir&s;t di&s;|covered
<PB N="307" REF="313">
Great-Britain to be an i&s;land. He likewi&s;e di&s;covered and &s;ubdued the Orkneys, and thus reduced the whole into a civilized province of the Roman empire. When the account of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es was brought to Do|mitian, he received it with a &s;eeming plea&s;ure, but real unea&s;ine&s;s. He thought Agricola's ri&s;ing reputation a reproach upon his own inacti|vity; and, in&s;tead of attempting to emulate, he re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s the merit of his &s;ervices. He ordered him therefore the external marks of his approbation, and took care that triumphant ornaments, &s;tatues and other honours &s;hould be decreed him; but at the &s;ame time he removed him from his command, under a pretence of appointing him to the government of Syria. By the&s;e means, Agricola &s;urrendered up his province to Salu&s;tius Lucullus, but &s;oon found that Syria was otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of. Upon his return to Rome, which was privately, and by night, he was cooly received by the empe|ror; and dying &s;ome time after in retirement, it was &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that his end was ha&s;t|ened by Domitian's direction.</P>
<P>Domitian &s;oon after found the want of &s;o experienced a commander, in the many irrup|tions of the barbarous nations that &s;urrounded the empire. The Sarmatians in Europe, joined with tho&s;e of A&s;ia, made a formidable inva|&s;ion, at once de&s;troying a whole legion, and a
<PB N="308" REF="314">
general of the Romans. The Dacians, under the conduct of Decebalus their king, made an irruption, and overthrew the Romans in &s;eve|ral engagements. The conte&s;ts now were not for the limits of the empire and the banks of the Danube, but the provinces them&s;elves were in danger. Lo&s;&s;es were followed by lo&s;&s;es, &s;o that every &s;ea&s;on became memorable for &s;ome remarkable overthrow. At la&s;t, however, the &s;tate making a vigorous exertion of its internal power, the barbarians were repelled partly by force, and partly by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of money, which only &s;erved to enable them to make fu|ture inva&s;ions to greater advantage. But in what|ever manner the enemy might have been re|pelled, Domitian was re&s;olved not to lo&s;e the honour of a triumph. He returned in great &s;plendor to Rome, and, not contented with thus triumphing twice without a victory, he re&s;olved to take the &s;urname of Germanicus, for his conque&s;t over a people with whom he never contended.</P>
<P>In proportion as the ridicule encrea&s;ed again&s;t him, his pride &s;eemed every day to demand greater homage. He would permit his &s;tatues to be made only of gold and &s;ilver; he a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf divine honours, and ordered that all men &s;hould treat him with the &s;ame appellations which they gave to the divinity. His cruelty was not behind his arrogance; he cau&s;ed num|bers
<PB N="309" REF="315">
of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;enators and others to be put to death upon the mo&s;t trifling pre|tences. One Aelius Lama was condemned and executed only for je&s;ting, tho' there was nei|ther novelty nor poignancy in his humour. Cocceanus was murdered only for celebrating the nativity of Otho. Pompo&s;ianus &s;hared the &s;ame fate, becau&s;e it was foretold by an a&s;tro|loger that he &s;hould be emperor. Salu&s;tius Lucullus, his lieutenant in Britain, was de&s;troy|ed only for having given his own name to a new &s;ort of launces of his own invention. Ju|nius Ru&s;ticus died for publi&s;hing a book, in which he commended Thra&s;ea and Pri&s;cus, two philo&s;ophers, who oppo&s;ed Ve&s;pa&s;ian's coming to the throne.</P>
<P>Such cruelties as the&s;e, that &s;eem almo&s;t without a motive, mu&s;t have con&s;equently pro|duced rebellion. Lucius Antonius, governor in upper Germany, knowing how much the empe|ror was dete&s;ted at home, re&s;olved upon &s;trik|ing for the throne, and accordingly a&s;&s;umed the en&s;igns of imperial dignity. As he was at the head of a formidable army, his &s;ucce&s;s remained long doubtful; but a &s;udden over|flowing of the Rhine, dividing his army, he was &s;et upon at that juncture by Normandus, the emperor's general, and totally routed. The news of this victory, we are told, was brought to Rome, by &s;upernatural means, on the &s;ame day that the battle was fought. Domitian's
<PB N="310" REF="316">
&s;everity was greatly encrea&s;ed by this &s;ucce&s;s, of &s;hort duration. In order to di&s;cover tho&s;e who were accomplices with the adver&s;e party, he invented new tortures; &s;ometimes cutting off the hands, at other times thru&s;ting fire into the privities of the people whom he &s;u&s;pected of being his enemies. During the&s;e &s;everities, he aggravated their guilt by hypocri&s;y, never pronouncing &s;entence with|out a preamble full of gentlene&s;s and mer|cy. The night before he crucified the comp|troller of his hou&s;hold, he treated him with the mo&s;t &s;eeming friend&s;hip, and ordered him a di&s;h of meat from his own table. He carried Aretinus Clemens with him in his own litter the day he had concluded upon his death. He was particularly terrible to the &s;enate and nobility, the whole body of whom he frequently threat|ened to extirpate entirely. At one time, he &s;urrounded the &s;enate hou&s;e with his troops, to the great con&s;ternation of the &s;enators. At another, he re&s;olved to amu&s;e him&s;elf with their terrors in a different manner. Having invited them to a public entertainment, he re|ceived them all very formally at the entrance of his palace, and conducted them into a &s;pa|cious hall, hung round with black, and illu|minated by a few melancholy lamps, that dif|fu&s;ed light, only &s;ufficient to &s;hew the horrors of the place. All around were to be &s;een no|thing but coffins, with the names of each of the
<PB N="311" REF="317">
&s;enators written upon them, together with other objects of terror and in&s;truments of exe|cution. While the company beheld all the&s;e pre|parations with &s;ilent agony, &s;everal men, having their bodies blackened, each with a drawn &s;word in one hand, and a flaming torch in the other, entered the hall, and danced round them. Af|ter &s;ome time, when the gue&s;ts expected no|thing le&s;s than the mo&s;t in&s;tant death, well knowing Domitian's capricious cruelty, the doors were &s;et open, and one of the &s;ervants came to inform them, that the emperor gave all the company leave to withdraw.</P>
<P>The&s;e cruelties were rendered &s;till more odi|ous by his lu&s;t and avarice. Frequently after pre&s;iding at an execution, he would retire with the lewde&s;t pro&s;titutes, and u&s;e the &s;ame baths which they did. His avarice, which was the con&s;equence of his profu&s;ion, had no bounds. He &s;eized upon the e&s;tates of all, again&s;t whom he could find the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions; the mo&s;t trifling action, or word, again&s;t the maje&s;ty of the prince, was &s;ufficient to ruin the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. He particularly exacted large &s;ums from the rich Jews, who even then began to practi&s;e the arts of peculation, for which they are at pre|&s;ent &s;o remarkable. He was excited again&s;t them, not only by avarice, but by jealou&s;y. A prophecy had been long current in the Ea&s;t, that a per&s;on from the line of David &s;hould rule the world. Whereupon, this &s;u&s;picious tyrant,
<PB N="312" REF="318">
willing to evade the prediction, commanded all the Jews of the lineage of David, to be dili|gently &s;ought out, and put to death. Two Chri&s;tians, grand&s;ons of St. Jude, the apo&s;tle, of that line, were brought before him; but finding them poor, and no way ambitious of temporal power, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, con&s;ider|ing them as objects too mean for his jealou&s;y. However, his per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians, was more &s;evere, than that of any of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. By his letters and edicts they were ba|ni&s;hed in &s;everal parts of the empire, and put to death with all the tortures of ingenious cru|elty. The predictions of the Chaldeans and a&s;trologers al&s;o, concerning his death, gave him violent apprehen&s;ions, and kept him in the mo&s;t tormenting di&s;quietude. As he approach|ed towards the end of his reign, he would per|mit no criminal, or pri&s;oner, to be brought into his pre&s;ence, till they were bound in &s;uch a manner, as to be incapable of injuring him, and he generally &s;ecured their chains in his own hands. His jealou&s;ies increa&s;ed to that degree, that he ordered the gallery in which he walked, to be &s;et round with a pellucid &s;tone, which &s;erved as a mirror to reflect the per&s;ons of all &s;uch as approached him from behind. Every omen and prodigy gave him fre&s;h anxiety. A&s;cleterion, the a&s;trologer, was brought before him, for publi&s;hing predictions of his death.
<PB N="313" REF="319">
As he did not attempt to deny the charge, the emperor demanded, if he knew his own for|tune? To which the a&s;trologer replied, that he &s;hould be devoured by dogs. Upon which, Do|mitian immediately ordered him to be &s;lain, and, to fru&s;trate his prediction, to be burnt imme|diately after. But we are told, that, while he was executing, a furious tempe&s;t aro&s;e, which blew down the body, and di&s;per&s;ed the executioners; and, in the mean time, the body was devoured by dogs, as the a&s;trologer had foretold. An accident like this was a &s;ufficient pretext for the death of hundreds. The la&s;t part of the tyrant's reign was more in&s;upport|able than any of the preceding. Nero exer|ci&s;ed his cruelties without being a &s;pectator; but a principal part of the Roman mi&s;eries, during this reign, was to &s;ee and be &s;een; to behold the &s;tern air, and fiery vi&s;age of the ty|rant, which he had armed again&s;t blu&s;hing by continued intemperance, directing the tortures, and maliciou&s;ly plea&s;ed with adding poignance to every agony.</P>
<P>But a period was &s;oon to be put to this mon|&s;ter's cruelty. Rome had now, by horrid ex|perience, learned the art of ridding her&s;elf of her tyrants. Among the number of tho&s;e whom he at once care&s;&s;ed and &s;u&s;pected, was his wife Domitia, whom he had taken from Aelius Lama, her former hu&s;band. This woman, however, was
<PB N="314" REF="320">
become obnoxious to him, for having placed her affections upon one Paris, a player; and he re&s;olved to di&s;patch her, with &s;everal others that he either hated or &s;u&s;pected. It was the tyrant's method to put down the names of all &s;uch as he intended to de&s;troy in his tablets, which he kept about him with great circum&s;pection. Domitia, fortunately, happening to get a &s;ight of them, was &s;truck at finding her own name in the cata|logue of tho&s;e fated to de&s;truction. She &s;hewed the fatal li&s;t to Norbanus and Petronius, praefects of the Praetorian bands, who found them&s;elves &s;et down; as likewi&s;e to Stephanus, the comptroller of the hou&s;hold, who came into the con&s;piracy with alacrity. Parthenius al&s;o, the chief chamberlain, was of the number; and the&s;e, after many con&s;ultations, determined, on the fir&s;t opportunity, to put their de&s;ign into execution; and, at length, fixed upon the eighteenth day of September, for the comple|tion of their great attempt. Domitian, who&s;e death was every day foretold by the a&s;trologers, who, of con&s;equence, mu&s;t at la&s;t be right in their predictions, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure apprehen&s;ive of that particular day; and, as he had been ever timorous, &s;o was he now more particularly upon his guard. He had for &s;ome time before &s;ecluded him&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of his palace, and at midnight was &s;o affrighted as to leap out of his bed, enquiring
<PB N="315" REF="321">
of his attendants what hour of the night it was. Upon their fal&s;ely a&s;&s;uring him that it was an hour later than that which he was taught to ap|prehend&punc; quite tran&s;ported, as if all danger were pa&s;t, he prepared to go to the bath. Ju&s;t then, Petronius, his chamberlain, came to inform him that Stephanus, the comptroller of the hou&s;hold, de&s;ired to &s;peak to him, upon an affair of the utmo&s;t importance. The emperor having given orders that his attendants &s;hould retire, Ste|phanus entered with his hand in a &s;carf, which he had worn thus for &s;ome days, the better to conceal a dagger, as none were permitted to ap|proach the emperor except unarmed. He be|gan by giving information of a pretended con|&s;piracy, and exhibited a paper, in which the particulars were &s;pecified. While Domitian was reading the contents, with an eager cu|rio&s;ity, Stephanus drew his dagger, and &s;truck him in the groin. The wound not being mor|tal, Domitian caught hold of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and threw him upon the ground, calling out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He demanded al&s;o his &s;word, that was u&s;ually placed under his pillow, and a boy who attended in the apartment, running to fetch it, found only the &s;cabbard, for Parthenius had previou&s;ly removed the blade. The &s;truggle with Stephanus &s;till continued; Domitian &s;till kept him under, and at one time attempted to wre&s;t the dagger from his hand, at another to
<PB N="316" REF="322">
tear out his eyes with his fingers. But Par|thenius, with his freedman, a gladiator, and two &s;ubaltern officers, now coming in, ran all fu|riou&s;ly upon the emperor, and di&s;patched him with &s;even wounds. In the mean time, &s;ome of the officers of the guard being alarmed, came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but too late to &s;ave him; however, they &s;lew Stephanus on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t incredible what &s;ome writers re|late concerning Appollonius Tyaneus, who was then at Ephe&s;us. This per&s;on, whom &s;ome call a magician, and &s;ome a philo&s;opher, but who more probably was nothing more than an impo&s;tor, was, ju&s;t at the minute in which Domitian was &s;lain, lecturing in one of the public gardens of the city. But &s;topping &s;hort, all of a &s;udden he cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Courage, Stephanus, &s;trike the tyrant."</Q> And then, after a pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Rejoice, my friends, the tyrant dies this day; this day do I &s;ay! the very moment in which I kept &s;ilence he &s;uf|fer'd for his crimes."</Q></P>
<P>However, the death of &s;uch a mon&s;ter &s;eemed to produce more preternatural di&s;turbances, and more predictions, than it de&s;erved. The truth &s;eems to be, that a belief in omens and prodigies were again becoming prevalent; the people were again relap&s;ing into pri&s;tine bar|barity; an age of ignorance is ever the proper &s;oil for an harve&s;t of impo&s;ture.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XIV. NERVA, the thirteenth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="96" UNIT="A.D."> WHEN it was publicly known that Do|mitian  was &s;lain, the joy of the &s;enate was &s;o great, that being a&s;&s;embled with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, they began to load his memory with every reproach. His &s;tatues were commanded to be taken down; and a decree was made, that all his in&s;criptions &s;hould be era&s;ed, his name &s;truck out of the regi&s;ters of fame, and his fu|neral omitted. The people, who now took little part in the affairs of government, looked on his death with indifference; the &s;oldiers alone, whom he had loaded with favours, and enriched by large&s;&s;es, &s;incerely regretted their benefactor.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, therefore, re&s;olved to provide a &s;ucce&s;&s;or before the army could have an oppor|tunity of taking the appointment upon them|&s;elves; and Cocceius Nerva was cho&s;en to the empire the very day on which the tyrant was &s;lain.</P>
<P>Nerva was of an illu&s;trious family, as mo&s;t &s;ay, by birth a Spaniard, and above &s;ixty-five
<PB N="318" REF="324">
years old when he was called to the throne. He was, at that time, the mo&s;t remarkable man in Rome, for his virtues, moderation, and his re&s;pect to the laws; and he owed his exaltation to the blamele&s;s conduct of his former life. When the &s;enate went to pay him their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions, he received them with his accu&s;tomed humility, while Arius Antonius, his mo&s;t in|timate friend, having embraced him with great familiarity, addre&s;t him in a language very dif|ferent from what former emperors were ac|cu&s;tomed to hear. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I come," cried he, "with others, to congratulate, not your good for|tune, but that of the Roman empire. You have long e&s;caped the malice of your ene|mies, and the cruelty of tyrants. Now, at the decline of life, to be plunged into new trou|bles, and &s;urrounding dangers, to be ex|po&s;ed, not only to the hatred of enemies, but to the dangerous reque&s;ts of friend&s;hip, is not a &s;tate to be wi&s;h'd for: your enemies will naturally envy; and your friends, pre|&s;uming upon your former favour, if their &s;uits be denied, will become enemies; &s;o that, you mu&s;t either injure the public, or lo&s;e their favour."</Q> Such candid advice was received with proper gratitude; and, indeed, no emperor &s;eemed to want &s;uch advice more than he; as the ea&s;y indulgence of his di&s;po|&s;ition made him the prey of his in&s;idious cour|tiers.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="325">
However, an exce&s;s of indulgence and hu|manity were faults that Rome could ea&s;ily par|don, after the cruelties of &s;uch an emperor as Domitian. Being long accu&s;tomed to tyranny, they regarded Nerva's gentle reign with rap|ture, and even gave his imbecility the name of benevolence. Upon coming to the throne, he &s;olemnly &s;wore that no &s;enator of Rome &s;hould be put to death by his command, during his reign, though they gave never &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e. This oath he &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that when two &s;enators had con&s;pired his death, he u&s;ed no kind of &s;everity again&s;t them; but &s;ending for them, to let them &s;ee he was not ignorant of their de&s;igns, he carried them with him to the public theatre: there pre&s;enting each with a dagger, he de&s;ired them to &s;trike, as he was determined not to ward off the blow. Such acts of clemency appeared to the multitude as virtues; but others &s;aw them in a different light, and con&s;idered them as encouragements to di&s;&s;olution. One of the principal men in Rome, was heard to declare, that it was indeed a misfortune to live under a prince who con|&s;idered innocence as a crime; but a greater &s;till, under one who regarded crimes as innocent. Having one night invited Veiento, one of Do|mitian's mo&s;t vicious favourites, to &s;upper, the conver&s;ation ran upon the vices of Catullus Me&s;&s;alinus, who&s;e memory was dete&s;ted for his
<PB N="320" REF="326">
cruelties, during the former reign. As each of the gue&s;ts mentioned him with horror, Nerva was induced to a&s;k one Mauricus, who &s;at at table, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What do you think, Mauricus, would become of &s;uch a man now?" "I think," replied Mauricus, pointing to Veiento, "that he would have been invited with us to &s;upper."</Q></P>
<P>However true &s;uch &s;arca&s;ms might have been, Nerva bore them with the utmo&s;t good hu|mour; ever de&s;irous of being rather loved than feared by his &s;ubjects. He conferred great favours, and be&s;towed large gifts, upon his particular friends. His liberality was &s;o ex|ten&s;ive, that, upon his fir&s;t promotion to the empire, he was con&s;trained to &s;ell his gold and &s;ilver plate, with his other rich moveables, to enable him to continue his liberalities. He re|lea&s;ed the cities of the empire from many &s;evere impo&s;itions, which had been laid upon them by Ve&s;pa&s;ian; he took off a rigorous tribute, which had been laid upon carriages, and re|&s;tored tho&s;e to their property who had been unju&s;tly di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t by Domitian.</P>
<P>During his &s;hort reign he made &s;everal good laws. He particularly prohibited the ca&s;tration of male children; which had been likewi&s;e condemned by his predece&s;&s;or, but not wholly removed. He put all tho&s;e &s;laves to death, who had, during the la&s;t reign, informed again&s;t
<PB N="321" REF="327">
their ma&s;ters. He permitted no &s;tatues to be erected to honour him, and converted &s;uch of Domitian's as had been &s;pared by the &s;enate, into money. He &s;old many rich robes, and much of the &s;plendid furniture of the palace, and retrenched &s;everal unrea&s;onable expences at court. At the &s;ame time, he had &s;o little regard for money, that when one of his &s;ub|jects had found a large trea&s;ure, and wrote to the emperor how to di&s;po&s;e of it, he received for an&s;wer, that he might <HI>u&s;e it:</HI> but the finder &s;till informing the emperor that it was a for|tune too large for a private per&s;on, Nerva, admiring his hone&s;ty, wrote him word, that then he might <HI>abu&s;e it.</HI></P>
<P>A life of &s;uch genero&s;ity and mildne&s;s, was not, however, without its enemies. Vigilius Rufus, who had oppo&s;ed him, was not only pardoned, but made his colleague in the con|&s;ul&s;hip. Calpurnius Cra&s;&s;us al&s;o, with &s;ome others, formed a dangerous con&s;piracy to de|&s;troy him; but Nerva would u&s;e no &s;everity: he re&s;ted &s;atisfied with bani&s;hing tho&s;e who were culpable, though the &s;enate were for in|flicting more rigorous puni&s;hments. But the mo&s;t dangerous in&s;urrection again&s;t his intere&s;ts, was from the Praetorian bands; who, headed by Ca&s;parius Olianus, in&s;i&s;ted upon revenging the late emperor's death, who&s;e memory was &s;till dear to them, from his frequent liberalities.
<PB N="322" REF="328">
Nerva, who&s;e kindne&s;s to good men, rendered him more obnoxious to the vicious, did all in his power to &s;top the progre&s;s of this in&s;ur|rection; he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the mutinous &s;oldiers, and opening his bo&s;om, de&s;ired them to &s;trike there, rather than be guilty of &s;o much inju&s;tice. The &s;oldiers, however, paid no re|gard to his remon&s;trances, but &s;eizing upon Petronius and Parthenius, &s;lew them in the mo&s;t ignominious manner. Not content with this, they even compelled the emperor to ap|prove of their &s;edition, and to make a &s;peech to the people, in which he thanked the cohorts for their fidelity.</P>
<P>So di&s;agreeable a con&s;traint upon the em|peror's inclinations, was, in the end, attended with the mo&s;t happy effects, as it cau&s;ed the adoption of Trajan to &s;ucceed him in the em|pire. Nerva perceived that in the pre&s;ent tur|bulent di&s;po&s;ition of the times, he &s;tood in need of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the empire, who might &s;hare the fatigues of government, and contribute to keep the licentious in awe. For this purpo&s;e, &s;etting a&s;ide all his own relations, he fixed upon Ulpius Trajan, an utter &s;tranger to his family, who was then governor in Upper Germany, to &s;ucceed him. Having put his determination in execution, and performed the accu&s;tomed &s;olemnities, he in&s;tantly &s;ent off amba&s;&s;adors to Cologne, where Trajan then re&s;ided, entreating
<PB N="323" REF="329">
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in puni&s;hing tho&s;e from whom he had received &s;uch an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>The adoption of this admirable man, proved &s;o great a curb to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ol|diery, that they continued in perfect obedience during the re&s;t of this reign; and Ca&s;perius being &s;ent to him, was, by his command, either bani&s;hed or put to death.</P>
<P>The adopting Trajan, was the la&s;t public act of Nerva. In about three months after, hav|ing put him&s;elf in a violent pa&s;&s;ion with one Regulus, a &s;enator, he was &s;eized with a fever, of which he &s;hortly after died, after a &s;hort reign of one year, four months, and nine days.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t foreign emperor who reign|ed in Rome, and ju&s;tly reputed a prince of great genero&s;ity and moderation. He is al&s;o cele|brated for his wi&s;dom, though with le&s;s rea&s;on, the greate&s;t in&s;tance he gave of it during his reign, being in the choice of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="851" UNIT="U. C"><MILESTONE N="98" UNIT="A.D."> TRAJAN'S family was originally from   Italy, but he him&s;elf was born in Seville in Spain. He very early accompanied his father,
<PB N="324" REF="330">
who was a general of the Romans, in his expe|ditions along the Euphrates and the Rhine, and while yet very young, acquired a con&s;iderable reputation for military accompli&s;hments. He enured his body to fatigue; he made long marches on foot; and laboured to acquire all that &s;kill in war which was nece&s;&s;ary for a com|mander. When he was made general of the army in Lower Germany, which was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable employments in the empire, it made no alteration in his manners or way of living, and the commander was &s;een no way differing from the private tribune, except in his &s;uperior wi&s;dom and virtues. The great qua|lities of his mind were accompanied with all the advantages of per&s;on. His body was ma|je&s;tic and vigorous; he was at that middle time of life which is happily tempered with the warmth of youth, and the caution of age, being forty-two years old. To the&s;e qualities were added, a mode&s;ty that &s;eemed peculiar to him|&s;elf alone; &s;o that mankind found a plea&s;ure in prai&s;ing tho&s;e accompli&s;hments of which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;eemed no way con&s;cious. Upon the whole, Trajan is di&s;tingui&s;hed as the greate&s;t and the be&s;t emperor of Rome. Others might have equalled him in war, and &s;ome might have been his rivals in clemency and goodne&s;s; but he &s;eems the only prince who united the&s;e ta|lents in the greate&s;t perfection, and who appears
<PB N="325" REF="331">
equally to engage our admiration, and our regard.</P>
<P>Upon being informed of the death of Nerva, he prepared to return to Rome, whither he was invited by the united entreaties of the &s;tate. He therefore began his march with a di&s;cipline that was for a long time unknown in the armies of the empire. The countries through which he pa&s;t, were neither ravaged nor taxed, and he entered the city, not in a triumphant manner, though he had de&s;erved many, but on foot, at|tended with the civil officers of the &s;tate, and followed by his &s;oldiers, who marched &s;ilently forward, with mode&s;ty and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t lectures he received, re&s;pect|ing his conduct in governing the empire, was from Plutarch, the philo&s;opher, who had the honour of being his ma&s;ter. Upon his arrival at Rome, he is &s;aid to have written him a let|ter, to the following purpo&s;e: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Since your merits, and not your importunities, have ad|vanced you to the empire, permit me to con|gratulate your virtues, and my own good fortune. If your future government proves an&s;werable to your former worth, I &s;hall be happy. But if you become wor&s;e for power, yours will be the danger, and mine the igno|miny of your conduct. The errors of the pupil will be charged upon his in&s;tructor. Seneca is reproached for the enormities of
<PB N="326" REF="332">
Nero; and Socrates and Quintillian have not e&s;caped cen&s;ure for the mi&s;conduct of their re&s;pective &s;cholars. But you have it in your power to make me the mo&s;t honoured of men, by continuing what you are. Continue the command of your pa&s;&s;ions; and make virtue the &s;cope of all your actions. If you follow the&s;e in&s;tructions, then will I glory in my having pre&s;umed to give them; if you neglect what I offer, then will this letter be my te&s;timony that you have not erred through the council and authority of Plutarch."</Q> I have in&s;erted this letter, whether genuine or not, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me well written; and a &s;trik|ing picture of this greate&s;t philo&s;opher's manner of addre&s;&s;ing that be&s;t of princes.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and unnece&s;&s;ary, to en|ter into a detail of this good monarch's labours for the &s;tate. His application to bu&s;ine&s;s, his moderation to his enemies, his mode&s;ty in exalta|tion, his liberality to the de&s;erving, and his fru|gality in his own expences; the&s;e have all been the &s;ubject of panegyric among his cotempo|raries; and they continue to be the admiration of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Upon giving the perfect of the Praetorian bands the &s;word, according to cu&s;tom, he made u&s;e of this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Take this &s;word, and u&s;e it: if I have merit, for me; if otherwi&s;e, again&s;t me."</Q> After which, he
<PB N="327" REF="333">
added, That he who gave laws was the fir&s;t who was bound to ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>If he had any failings, they were his love of women; which, however, never hurried him beyond the bounds of decency; and his immo|derate pa&s;&s;ion for war, to which he had been bred up from his childhood. The fir&s;t war he was engaged in after his coming to the throne, was with the Dacians, who, during the reign of Domitian, had committed numberle&s;s ravages upon the provinces of the empire. He therefore rai&s;ed a powerful army, and with great expe|dition marched into tho&s;e barbarous countries, where he was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Decebalus, the Dacian king, who for a long time with&s;tood his bolde&s;t efforts. At length, however, being con&s;trained to come to a general battle, and no longer able to protract the war, he was routed with great &s;laughter; though not without great lo&s;s to the conqueror. The Roman &s;oldiers, upon this occa&s;ion, wanting linen to bind up their wounds, the emperor tore his own robes to &s;upply them. This victory compelled the enemy to &s;ue for peace, which they obtained upon very di&s;advantageous terms; their king coming into the Roman camp, and acknow|ledging him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al of the Roman em|pire.</P>
<P>Upon Trajan's return, after the u&s;ual tri|umphs and rejoicings upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, he
<PB N="328" REF="334">
was &s;urpri&s;ed with an account, that the Da|cians had renewed ho&s;tilities. Decebalus, their king, was now, therefore, a &s;econd time, ad|judged an enemy to the Roman &s;tate, and Trajan invaded his dominions with an army equal to that with which he had before &s;ub|dued him. But Decebalus, now grown more cautious by his former defeat, u&s;ed every art to avoid coming to an engagement. He al&s;o put various &s;tratagems in practice, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy; and, at one time, Trajan him&s;elf was in danger of being &s;lain or taken. He al&s;o took Longinus, one of the Roman gene|rals, pri&s;oner, and threatened to kill him, in ca&s;e Trajan refu&s;ed granting him terms of peace. But the emperor replied, That peace and war had not their dependance upon the &s;afety of one &s;ubject only; wherefore Longi|nus, &s;ome time after, de&s;troyed him&s;elf by a voluntary death. The fate of this general &s;eemed to give new vigour to Trajan's opera|tions. In order to be better enabled to invade the enemy's territories at plea&s;ure, he under|took a mo&s;t &s;tupendous work, which was no le&s;s than building a bridge acro&s;s the Danube. This amazing &s;tructure, which was built over a deep, broad and rapid river, con&s;i&s;ted of more than twenty-two arches, an hundred and fifty feet high, and an hundred and &s;eventy broad: the ruins of this &s;tructure, which remain to this day,
<PB N="329" REF="335">
&s;hew modern architects how far they were &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed by the ancients, both in the greatne&s;s and the boldne&s;s of their de&s;igns. Upon fini&s;h|ing this work, Trajan continued the war with great vigour, &s;haring with the meane&s;t of his &s;oldiers the fatigues of the campaign, and con|tinually encouraging them to their duty by his own example. By the&s;e means, notwith&s;tanding the country was &s;pacious and uncultivated, and the inhabitants brave and hardy, he &s;ubdued the whole, and added the kingdom of Dacia, as a province to the Roman empire. Dece|balus made &s;ome attempts to e&s;cape, but be|ing &s;urrounded on every &s;ide, he at la&s;t &s;lew him&s;elf, and his head was &s;ent immediately to Rome, to certify his misfortune there. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;eemed to advance the empire to a greater degree of &s;plendour, than it had hi|therto acquired. Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;een to come from the interior parts of India, to con|gratulate Trajan's &s;ucce&s;s, and be&s;peak his friend&s;hip. At his return to Rome, he entered the city in triumph; and the rejoicings for his victories la&s;ted for the &s;pace of an hundred and twenty days.</P>
<P>Having thus given peace and pro&s;perity to the empire, Trajan continued his reign, loved, honoured, and almo&s;t adored, by his &s;ubjects. He adorned the city with public buildings; he freed it from &s;uch men as lived by their vices;
<PB N="330" REF="336">
he entertained per&s;ons of merit with the utmo&s;t familiarity; and &s;o little feared his enemies, that he could &s;carcely be induced to &s;uppo&s;e that he had any. Being one day told by &s;ome, that his friend and favourite, Sura, was fal&s;e to him; Trajan, to &s;hew how much he relied upon his fidelity, went, in his ordinary manner, to &s;up with him. There he commanded Sura's &s;urgeon to be brought, whom he ordered to take off the hair about his eye brows. He then made the barber &s;have his beard, and after went unconcerned into the bath as u&s;ual. The next day, when Sura's accu&s;ers were renewing their obloquy, Trajan informing them how he had &s;pent the night, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If," cried he, "Sura had any de&s;igns again&s;t my life, he then had the faire&s;t opportunity."</Q></P>
<P>It had been happy for this great prince's me|mory, if he had &s;hewn equal clemency to all his &s;ubjects; but, about the ninth year of his <MILESTONE N="860" UNIT="U. C."> reign, he was per&s;uaded to look upon the <MILESTONE N="107" UNIT="A.D."> Chri&s;tians with a &s;u&s;picious eye. The extreme veneration which he profe&s;&s;ed for the religion of the empire, &s;et him &s;edulou&s;ly to oppo&s;e every innovation, and the progre&s;s of chri&s;tianity &s;eem|ed to alarm him. A law had &s;ome time before been pa&s;&s;ed, in which all Heteriae, or &s;ocieties di&s;&s;enting from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, were con|&s;idered as illegal, being reputed nur&s;eries of im|po&s;ture and &s;edition. Under the &s;anction of this
<PB N="331" REF="337">
law, the Chri&s;tians were per&s;ecuted in all parts of the empire. Great numbers of them were put to death, as well by popular tumults as by edicts and judicial proceedings. In this per&s;ecution, St. Clemens, bi&s;hop of Rome, was condemned to be thrown into the &s;ea, with an anchor about his neck; St. Simeon, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, at the age of a hundred and twenty, was &s;courged and cru|cified; and St. Ignatius, who had a particular di&s;pute with Trajan, at Antioch, was con|demned to be thrown to wild bea&s;ts, in the amphitheatre at Rome. However, the per&s;e|cution cea&s;ed after &s;ome time; for the emperor having advice from Pliny, the pro-con&s;ul in Bi|thynia, of the innocence and &s;implicity of the Chri&s;tians, and of their inoffen&s;ive and moral way of living, he &s;u&s;pended their puni&s;hments. But a total &s;top was put to them upon Tiberi|anus, the governor of Pale&s;tine's, &s;ending him word, That he was wearied out with executing the laws again&s;t the Galileans, who crowded to execution in &s;uch multitudes, that he was at a lo&s;s how to proceed. Upon this information, the emperor gave orders, that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould not be &s;ought after; but if any offered them&s;elves, that they &s;hould &s;uffer. In this manner the rage of per&s;ecution cea&s;ed, and the emperor found lei&s;ure to turn the force of his arms again&s;t the Armenians and Parthians,
<PB N="332" REF="338">
who now began to throw off all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Rome.</P>
<P>While he was employed in the&s;e wars, there was a dreadful in&s;urrection of the Jews in all parts of the empire. This wretched people, &s;till infatuated, and ever expecting &s;ome &s;ignal deliverer, took the advantage of Trajan's ab|&s;ence in the ea&s;t, to ma&s;&s;acre all the Greeks, and Romans, which they got into their power, without reluctance or mercy. This rebellion fir&s;t began in Cyrene, a Roman pro|vince in Africa; from thence the flame ex|tended to Egypt, and next to the i&s;land of Cyprus. The&s;e places, they, in a manner, di&s;peopled with ungovernable fury. Their bar|barities were &s;uch, that they ate the fle&s;h of their enemies, wore their &s;kins, &s;awed them a&s;under, ca&s;t them to wild bea&s;ts, made them kill each other, and &s;tudied new torments by which to de&s;troy them. However, the&s;e cru|elties were of no long duration; the governors of the re&s;pective provinces making head again&s;t their tumultuous fury, &s;oon treated them with a retaliation of cruelty, and put them to death, not as human beings, but as outrageous pe&s;ts to &s;ociety. As the Jews had practi&s;ed their cruelties in Cyprus particularly, a law was publicly enacted, by which it was made capital for any Jew to &s;et foot on the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="339">
During the&s;e bloody tran&s;actions, Trajan was pro&s;ecuting his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the Ea&s;t. His fir&s;t march was into Armenia, the king of which country had di&s;claimed all alliance with Rome, and received the en&s;igns of royalty and dominion from the monarch of Parthia. How|ever, upon the news of Trajan's expedition, his fears were &s;o great, that he abandoned his country to the invader; while the greate&s;t part of his governors and nobility came &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to the emperor, acknowledging them&s;elves his &s;ubjects, and making him the mo&s;t co&s;tly pre|&s;ents. Having in this manner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole country, and gotten the king into his power, he marched into the dominions of the king of Parthia. There entering the opu|lent kingdom of Me&s;&s;opotamia, he reduced it into the form of a Roman province. From thence he went again&s;t the Parthians, marching on foot at the head of his army; in this man|ner cro&s;&s;ing rivers, and conforming to all the &s;everities of di&s;cipline, which were impo&s;ed upon the meane&s;t &s;oldier. His &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t the Parthians were great and numerous. He conquered Syria and Chalde&aacute;, and took the famous city of Babylon. Here, attempting to cro&s;s the Euphrates, he was oppo&s;ed by the enemy, who were re&s;olved to &s;top his pa&s;|&s;age; but he &s;ecretly cau&s;ed boats to be made upon the adjoining mountains; and bringing
<PB N="334" REF="340">
them to the water &s;ide, pa&s;&s;ed his army with great expedition, not, however, without great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. From thence he tra|ver&s;ed large tracts of country, which had never before been invaded by a Roman army, and &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in pur&s;uing the &s;ame march, which Alexander the Great had for|merly marked out before him. Having pa&s;&s;ed the rapid &s;tream of the Tigris, he advanced to the city Cte&s;iphon, which he took and opened him&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age into Per&s;ia, where he made many conque&s;ts, that were rather &s;plendid than &s;erviceable. After &s;ubduing all the coun|try bordering on the Tigris, he marched &s;outh|ward to the Per&s;ian gulph, where he &s;ubdued a monarch who po&s;&s;e&s;t a con&s;iderable i&s;land, made by the divided &s;treams of that river. Here winter coming on, he was in danger of lo&s;ing the greate&s;t part of his army by the in|clemency of the climate and the inundations of the river. He therefore with indefatigable pains fitted out a fleet, and &s;ailing down the Per|&s;ian gulph, entered the Indian ocean, conquer|ing even to the Indies, and &s;ubduing a part of them to the Roman empire. He was pre|vented from pur&s;uing further conque&s;ts in this di&s;tant country, both by the revolt of many of the provinces he had already &s;ub|dued, and by the &s;carcity of proui&s;ions, which &s;eemed to contradict the reports of the fertility
<PB N="335" REF="341">
of the countries he was induced to invade. The inconveniencies of encrea&s;ing age, al&s;o contributed to damp the ardour of this en|terprize, which at one time he intended to pur|&s;ue to the confines of the earth. Returning therefore, along the Per&s;ian gulph, and &s;end|ing the &s;enate a particular account of all the nations he had conquered, the names of which alone compo&s;ed a long catalogue, he prepared to puni&s;h tho&s;e countries which had revolted from him. He began by laying the famous city of Ede&s;&s;a, in Me&s;opotamia, in a&s;hes; and in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, not only retook all tho&s;e places which had before acknowledged &s;ubjection, but conquered many other provin|ces, &s;o as to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the mo&s;t fertile kingdoms of all A&s;ia. In this train of &s;ucce&s;&s;es he &s;carce met with a repul&s;e, except before the city Atra, in the de&s;arts of Arabia. Wherefore judging that this was a proper time for bounding his conque&s;ts, he re&s;olved to give a ma&s;ter to the countries he had &s;ub|dued. With this re&s;olution he repaired to the city Cte&s;iphon, in Per&s;ia, and there with great ceremony crowned Parthena&s;pates, king of Parthia, to the great joy of all his &s;ubjects. He e&s;tabli&s;hed another king al&s;o over the kingdom of Albania, near the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. Then placing governors and lieutenants in other ptovinces, he re&s;olved to return to his
<PB N="336" REF="342">
capital in a more magnificent manner than any of his predece&s;&s;ors had done before him. He accordingly left Adrian general of all his forces in the ea&s;t, and continued his journey towards Rome, where the mo&s;t magnificent preparations were made for his arrival. How|ever, he had not got farther than the pro|vince of Cilicia, when he found him&s;elf too weak to proceed in his u&s;ual manner. He therefore ordered him&s;elf to be carried on &s;hip board, to the city of Saleucia, where he died of the apoplexy, having been attacked by that di&s;order once before. During the time of his indi&s;po&s;ition, his wife Plotina con&s;tantly at|tended near him; and knowing the emperor's di&s;like to Adrian, it is thought forged the <MILESTONE N="870" UNIT="U. C."> <MILESTONE N="117" UNIT="A.D."> will, by which he was adopted to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Trajan died in the &s;ixty-third year of his age, after a reign of nineteen years, &s;ix months and fifteen days. How highly he was e&s;teemed by his &s;ubjects appears from their man|ner of ble&s;&s;ing his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, always wi&s;h|ing them the fortune of Augu&s;tus, and the goodne&s;s of Trajan. His military virtues, however, upon which he chiefly valued him|&s;elf, produced no real advantage to his coun|try, and all his conque&s;ts di&s;appeared, when the power was withdrawn that enforced them.</P>
<P>But &s;till it may be a&s;&s;erted that the Ro|man empire was never &s;o large as when he
<PB N="337" REF="343">
left it, nor &s;o formidable to the re&s;t of the world. Its &s;trength, however, was much im|paired; for being &s;pread over &s;o great an ex|tent of territory, it wanted that invigorating principle of patrioti&s;m to in&s;pire its &s;ubjects in its defence. Its bulk &s;eemed rather a &s;ymp|tom of its di&s;ea&s;e, than its vigour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. ADRIAN, the Fifteenth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P>ADRIAN was by de&s;cent a Spaniard, and of the &s;ame city where Trajan was born. He was nephew to Trajan, and married to Sabina his grand niece. When Trajan was adopted to the empire, Adrian was a tribune of the army in Mae&s;ia, and was &s;ent by the troops to congratulate the emperor on his ad|vancement. However, his brother-in-law, who de&s;ired to have an opportunity of congratulating Trajan him&s;elf, &s;upplied Adrian with a carriage that broke down on the way. Adrian, how|ever, was re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time, and per|formed the re&s;t of the journey on foot. This a&s;&s;iduity was very plea&s;ing to the emperor; but he di&s;liked Adrian from &s;everal more pre|vailing motives. His kin&s;man was expen&s;ive
<PB N="338" REF="344">
and involved in debt. He was, be&s;ides, in|con&s;tant, capricious and apt to envy another's reputation. The&s;e were faults, that in Tra|jan's opinion could not be compen&s;ated either by his learning or his talents. His great &s;kill in the Greek and Latin languages, his inti|mate acquaintance with the laws of his coun|try, and the philo&s;ophy of the times, were no inducements to Trajan, who, being bred him|&s;elf a &s;oldier, de&s;ired to have a military man to &s;ucceed him. For this rea&s;on it was that the dying emperor would by no means appoint a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; fearful, perhaps, of injuring his great reputation, by adopting a per&s;on that was unworthy. His death, therefore, was con|cealed for &s;ome time by Plotina, his wife, till Adrian had &s;ounded the inclinations of the army, and found them firm in his intere&s;ts. They then produced a forged in&s;trument, im|porting that Adrian was adopted to &s;ucceed in the empire. By this artifice he was elected by all orders of the &s;tate, tho' then ab&s;ent from Rome, being left at Antioch, as general of the forces in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon Adrian's election, his fir&s;t care was to write to the &s;enate, excu&s;ing him&s;elf for a&s;|&s;uming the empire without their previous ap|probation; imputing it to the ha&s;ty zeal of the army, who rightly judged that the &s;enate ought not long to remain without an head
<PB N="339" REF="345">
He then began to pur&s;ue a cour&s;e quite op|po&s;ite to that of his predece&s;&s;or, taking every method of declining war, and promoting the arts of peace. He was quite &s;atisfied with pre|&s;erving the ancient limits of the empire, and &s;eemed no way ambitious of exten&s;ive con|que&s;t. For this rea&s;on he abandoned all the conque&s;ts which Trajan had made, judg|ing them to be rather an inconvenience than an advantage to the empire. He therefore made the river Euphrates the boundary of the empire, and placed the legions along its banks to prevent the incur&s;ions of the enemy.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled the affairs of the ea&s;t, and leaving Severus governor of Syria, he took his journey by land to Rome, &s;ending the a&s;hes of Trajan thither by &s;ea. Upon his ap|proach to the city, he was informed that a magnificent triumph was preparing for him; but this he mode&s;tly declined, de&s;iring that the&s;e honours might be paid to Trajan's me|mory, which they had de&s;igned for him. In con&s;equence of this command, a mo&s;t &s;uperb triumph was decreed, in which Trajan's &s;tatue was carried as the principal figure in the pro|ce&s;&s;ion, it being remarked that he was the only man that ever triumphed after he was dead. Not content with paying him the&s;e extraor|dinary honours, his a&s;hes were placed in a golden urn, upon the top of a column an
<PB N="340" REF="346">
hundred and forty feet high. On this were engraven the particulars of all his exploits in ba&s;&s;o relievo, a work of great labour, and which is &s;till remaining.</P>
<P>It was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to appear with any lu&s;tre, after an emperor &s;o loved and admired as Trajan; notwith&s;tanding the merits of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to con&s;ole the people for their lo&s;s. Adrian was one of the mo&s;t remarkable of the Roman emperors for the variety of his endowments. He was highly &s;kilful in all the exerci&s;es both of body and mind. He compo&s;ed with great beauty, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e; he pleaded at the bar, and was one of the be&s;t orators of his time. He was deeply ver&s;ed in the mathematics, and no le&s;s &s;kilful in phy&s;ic. In drawing and paint|ing, he was equal to the greate&s;t ma&s;ters; an excellent mu&s;ician, and &s;ung to admiration. Be&s;ides the&s;e qualifications, he had an a&s;toni&s;h|ing memory; he knew the names of all his &s;ol|diers, tho' never &s;o long ab&s;ent. He could dictate to one, confer with another, and write him&s;elf, all at the &s;ame time. He was remark|ably expert in military di&s;cipline, he was &s;trong and very &s;kilful in arms, both on hor&s;eback and on foot, and frequently with his own hand killed wild-boars, and even lions, in hunt|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="347">
His moral virtues were not le&s;s than his ac|compli&s;hments. Upon his fir&s;t exaltation, he forgave an infinite number of debts due to the exchequer, remitting the large arrears to which the provinces were liable, and burning the bonds and regi&s;ters of them in the public Forum. He refu&s;ed to take the confi&s;cated e&s;tates of condemned per&s;ons into his private coffers, but ordered them to be placed in the public trea|&s;ury. His moderation and clemency appeared by pardoning the injuries which he had receiv|ed when he was yet but a private man. One day meeting a per&s;on who had formerly been his mo&s;t inveterate enemy, "My good friend," cried he, "you have e&s;caped, for I am made em|peror." He had &s;o great a veneration for the &s;enate, and was &s;o careful of not introducing unworthy per&s;ons into it, that he told the cap|tain of his guard, when he made him a &s;ena|tor, that he had no honours in his gift, equal to what he then be&s;towed. He was affable to his friends, and gentle to per&s;ons of meaner &s;tations; he relieved their wants, and vi&s;ited them in &s;ickne&s;s, it being his con&s;tant maxim, that he was an emperor not for his own good, but for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e were his virtues, which were contra&s;t|ed by a &s;trange mixture of vices; or, to &s;ay the truth, he wanted &s;trength of mind to pre&s;erve his general rectitude of character without de|viation.

Thus he is repre&s;ented as proud and vain-glorious, envious and detractive, ha&s;ty and revengeful, inqui&s;itive into other men's af|fairs, and often induced by &s;ycophants and informers to acts of cruelty and inju&s;tice. He permitted the revival of the per&s;ecution again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, and &s;hewed many in&s;tances of a bad di&s;po&s;ition, which it was the whole &s;tudy of his life to correct or to conceal.</P>
<P>But, however Adrian might have been, as to his private character, his conduct as an empe|ror appears mo&s;t admirable, as all his public tran&s;actions appear dictated by the &s;ounde&s;t policy, and the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted wi&s;dom. He was &s;carce &s;ettled on the throne, when &s;everal of the northern barbarians, the Alani, the Sarmatians and the Dacians, began to make deva&s;tations on the empire. The&s;e hardy na|tions, who now found the way to conquer, by i&s;&s;uing from their fore&s;ts, and then retiring upon the approach of a &s;uperior force to op|po&s;e them, began to be truly formidable at Rome. Adrian had thoughts of contracting the limits of the empire, by giving up &s;ome of the mo&s;t remote and lea&s;t defen&s;ible provin|ces; but in this he was over-ruled by his friends, who wrongly imagined that an ex|ten&s;ive frontier would intimidate an invading enemy. But tho' he complied with their re|mon&s;trances, he broke down the bridge over
<PB N="343" REF="349">
Danube, which his predece&s;&s;or had built, &s;en|&s;ible that the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age which was open to him, was equally convenient for the incur&s;ions of his barbarous neighbours.</P>
<P>While he was employed in compelling the&s;e nations to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, a con&s;piracy was di&s;co|vered, carried on among four per&s;ons of con|&s;ular dignity at home. The&s;e had agreed to kill him, either while he was offering &s;acrifice, or while he was hunting. Their de&s;igns, how|ever, were timely di&s;covered, and the con&s;pi|rators put to death, by order of the &s;enate. Adrian took great pains to clear him&s;elf from the imputation of having had any hand in their execution; he had &s;worn upon his advance|ment, to put no &s;enator to death, and he now declared that the delinquents died without his permi&s;&s;ion. But in order entirely to &s;uppre&s;s the murmurs of the people upon this head, he di&s;tributed large &s;ums of money among them, and called off their attention from this act of &s;everity, to magnificent &s;hows, and the various diver&s;ions of the amphiteatre.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed a &s;hort time at Rome, &s;o as to &s;ee that all things were regulated and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the &s;afety of the public, he pre|pared to vi&s;it and take a view of his whole empire. It was one of his maxims, that an emperor ought to immitate the &s;un, which dif|fu&s;es warmth and vigour over all parts of the
<PB N="344" REF="350">
earth. He therefore took with him a &s;plendid court, and a con&s;iderable force, and entered the province of Gaul, where he made an enu|meration of all the inhabitants. From Gaul he went into Germany, from thence to Hol|land, and next pa&s;&s;ed over into Britain. There reforming many abu&s;es, and reconciling the natives to the Romans; for the better &s;ecurity of the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, he built a wall of wood and earth, extending from the river Eden in Cumberland, to the Tine in Northumberland, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Picts, and other barbarous nations in the north. From Britain, returning through Gaul, he directed his journey to Spain, where he was received with great joy, as being a native of that country. Here, wintering in the city of Tarragona, he called a meeting of the de|puties from all the provinces, and ordained many things for the benefit of the nation. Happening, while he was in Spain, to walk in his garden, one of the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e ran furiou&s;ly at him, with a drawn &s;word, to kill him; but the emperor warding off the blow, and clo&s;ing with him, quickly di&s;armed him; then delivering him to his guards, he ordered that he might have a phy|&s;ician to bleed him; con&s;idering the poor crea|ture, as in fact he was, a madman. From Spain, returning to Rome, he continued there
<PB N="345" REF="351">
for &s;ome time, in order to prepare for his journey into the ea&s;t, which was ha&s;tened by a new inva&s;ion of the Parthians. His approach compelling the enemy to peace, he pur&s;ued his travels without mole&s;tation. Arriving in A&s;ia Minor, he turned out of his way to vi&s;it the famous city of Athens. There he made a con&s;iderable &s;tay, was innitiated into the Eleu|&s;inian my&s;teries, which were accounted the mo&s;t &s;acred in the pagan mythology, and took upon him the office of archon, or chief magi&s;trate of the place. In this place al&s;o, he remitted the &s;everity of the Chri&s;tian per&s;ecution, at the repre&s;entation of Granianus, the procon&s;ul of A&s;ia, who repre&s;ented the people of that per|&s;ua&s;ion, as no way culpable. He was even &s;o far reconciled to them, as to think of re|ceiving Chri&s;t into the number of the Gods. After a winter's continuance at Athens, he went over into Sicily, and vi&s;ited Aetna, and the other curio&s;ities of the place. Returning from thence once more to Rome, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he prepared &s;hips, and cro&s;t over into Africa. There he &s;pent much time in regu|lating abu&s;es, and reforming the government, in deciding controver&s;ies, and erecting mag|nificent buildings. Among the re&s;t, he or|dered Carthage to be rebuilt; calling it, after his own name, Adrianople. Again returning to Rome, where he &s;tayed but a very little
<PB N="346" REF="352">
time, he travelled a &s;econd time into Greece, pa&s;t over into A&s;ia Minor, from thence went into Syria, gave laws and in&s;tructions to all the neighbouring kings whom he invited to come and con&s;ult with him; then entered Pa|le&s;tine, Arabia, and Aegypt; where he cau&s;ed Pompey's tomb, that had been long neglected and almo&s;t covered with &s;and, to be renewed and beautified. He al&s;o gave orders for the rebuilding of Jeru&s;alem, which was performed with great expedition, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Jews, who now began to conceive hopes of being re&s;tored to their long lo&s;t kingdom. But the&s;e expectations only &s;erved to aggravate their calamities; for being incen&s;ed at the pri|vileges which were granted the pagan wor&s;hip|pers in their new city, they fell upon all the Romans and Chri&s;tians that were di&s;per&s;ed throughout Judea, and unmercifully put them all to the &s;word. In this cruel and de&s;perate undertaking they were chiefly incited by one Barcocab, an impo&s;tor, who, willing to be thought the Me&s;&s;iah, or perhaps believing him&s;elf to be &s;o, declared that he him&s;elf was the &s;tar foretold by Balaam, and that he was come down as a light from heaven to re&s;cue them from bondage. Adrian was at Athens when this dangerous in&s;urrection began; where|fore &s;ending a powerful body of men, under the command of Julius Severus, this general
<PB N="347" REF="353">
obtained many &s;ignal, though bloody, victories over the in&s;urgents. The war was concluded in two years, by the demolition of above a thou&s;and of their be&s;t towns, and the de&s;truc|tion of near &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men in battle.</P>
<P>He then bani&s;hed all tho&s;e who remained out of Judea; and, by a public decree, forbade any to come within view of their native &s;oil. This in&s;urrection was &s;oon after followed by a dan|gerous irruption of the barbarous nations to the northward of the empire; who entering Media with great fury, and pa&s;&s;ing through Armenia, carried their deva&s;tations as far as Cappadocia. Adrian preferring peace, upon any terms, to an unprofitable war, bought them off by large &s;ums of money; &s;o that they return|ed peaceably into their native wilds, to enjoy their plunder, and meditate fre&s;h inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>Adrian having now &s;pent thirteen years in travelling through his dominions, and reform|ing the abu&s;es of the empire, re&s;olved, at length, to return, and end all his fatigues at Rome. Nothing could be more grateful to the people than his pre&s;ent re&s;olution, of coming to re&s;ide, for the re&s;t of his days, among them: they received him with the loude&s;t demon&s;trations of joy; and, though he now began to grow old and unwieldy, he re|mitted not the lea&s;t of his former a&s;&s;iduity and application to the public welfare. His chief
<PB N="348" REF="354">
amu&s;ement was in conver&s;ing with the mo&s;t celebrated men in every art and &s;cience, fre|quently boa&s;ting, that he thought no kind of knowledge incon&s;iderable, or to be neglected, either in his private or public capacity. This de&s;ire of knowing was laudable, if kept within bounds: but he &s;eemed to affect univer&s;al ex|cellence; and even envied all, who a&s;pired at an equal reputation in any of the arts with him|&s;elf. It is &s;aid, that he ordered Apollodorus, the architect, to be put to death, only for too freely remarking upon the errors of &s;ome &s;tructure erected from the emperor's de&s;igns. However this be, he took great delight in di&s;|puting among the learned men, and the philo|&s;ophers who attended him; nor were they le&s;s careful in granting him, that &s;uperiority he &s;eemed &s;o eagerly to affect. Favorinus, a man of great reputation in his court for philo&s;ophy, happening one day to di&s;pute with him upon &s;ome philo&s;ophical &s;ubject, acknowledged him|&s;elf to be overcome. His friends blamed him for thus giving up the argument, when he might ea&s;ily have pur&s;ued it with &s;ucce&s;s. <Q>"How!" replied Favorinus, who was proba|bly a better courtier than philo&s;opher, "would you have me contend with a man, who is ma&s;ter of thirty legions?"</Q> Adrian was &s;o fond of literary fame, that we are told, he wrote his own life, and afterwards gave it to
<PB N="349" REF="355">
his &s;ervants to publi&s;h under their names. But whatever might have been his weakne&s;s in aiming at univer&s;al reputation, he was in no part of his reign remi&s;s, in attending the duties of his exalted &s;tation. He ordered the knights and &s;enators never to appear in public, but in the proper habits of their orders. He forbade ma&s;ters to kill their &s;laves; as had been before allowed; but ordained that they &s;hould be tried by the laws enacted again&s;t capital offences. A law &s;o ju&s;t, had he done nothing more, de|&s;erved to have en&s;ured his reputation with po&s;terity, and to have made him dear to man|kind. He &s;till further extended the lenity of the laws to tho&s;e unhappy men, who had been long thought too mean for ju&s;tice. If a ma&s;ter was found killed in his hou&s;e, he would not allow all his &s;laves to be put to the torture, as formerly, but only &s;uch as might have perceived or prevented the murder.</P>
<P>In &s;uch cares he con&s;umed the greate&s;t part of his time; but, at la&s;t, finding the duties of his &s;tation daily encrea&s;ing, and his own &s;trength proportionably upon the decline, he re&s;olved upon adopting a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who&s;e me|rits might de&s;erve, and who&s;e courage &s;ecure, his exaltation. After many deliberations, he made choice of Lucius Commodus, who&s;e bo|dily infirmities rendered him unfit for a tru&s;t of &s;uch importance. Of this, after &s;ome time,
<PB N="350" REF="356">
Adrian &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible, declaring, that he re|pented of having cho&s;en &s;o feeble a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and &s;aying, That he had leaned again&s;t a moul|dering wall. However, Commodus &s;oon after dying, the emperor immediately adopted Mar|cus Antoninus, afterwards &s;urnamed the Pious; but previou&s;ly obliged him to adopt two others, namely, Marcus Aurelius, and Lucius Verus, who afterwards &s;ucceeded to the empire.</P>
<P>While he was thus careful in appointing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, his bodily infirmities daily encrea&s;ed; and, at length, his pains becoming in&s;upport|able, he vehemently de&s;ired that &s;ome of his attendants would di&s;patch him. Antoninus, however, would by no means permit any of his dome&s;tics to be guilty of &s;o great an impiety, but u&s;ed all the arts in his power to reconcile the emperor to &s;u&s;tain life. At one time he produced a woman, who pretended that &s;he was warned in a dream, that he &s;hould recover his health; at another, a man was brought from Pannonia, who gave him the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances. Neverthele&s;s, Adrian's pains encrea&s;ed every day. He frequently cried out, How mi&s;e|rable a thing it was to &s;eek death, and not to find it. He engaged one Ma&s;tor, partly by threats, and partly by entreaties, to pro|mi&s;e to di&s;patch him; but Ma&s;tor, in&s;tead of obeying, con&s;ulted his own &s;afety by flight; &s;o that, he who was ma&s;ter of the lives of mil|lions,
<PB N="351" REF="357">
was not able to di&s;po&s;e of his own. In this deplorable exigence, he re&s;olved on going to Baiae, where the tortures of his di&s;ea&s;es en|crea&s;ing, they affected his underdanding, &s;o that he gave orders for &s;everal per&s;ons to be put to death; which Antoninus, according to his u&s;ual wi&s;dom, never meant to obey. Con|tinuing, for &s;ome time, in the&s;e excruciating circum&s;tances, the emperor was at la&s;t re&s;olved to ob&s;erve no regimen, often &s;aying, That kings died merely by the multitude of their phy|&s;icians. This conduct &s;erved to ha&s;ten that death he &s;eemed &s;o ardently to de&s;ire; and it was probably joy upon its approach which dictated the celebrated &s;tanzas which are &s;o well known, upon the repetition of which he expired <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<P><MILESTONE N="891" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="886" UNIT="A.D."> TITUS ANTONINUS, whom Adrian had  appointed for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was born in the city of Ni&s;mes, in Gaul. His father was a noble|man of an antient family, which had enjoyed the highe&s;t honours of the &s;tate. At the time of his &s;ucceeding to the throne, he was above fifty years old, and had pa&s;&s;ed through many of the mo&s;t important offices of the &s;tate with great integrity and application. His virtues in private
<PB N="353" REF="359">
life, were no way impaired by exaltation, as he &s;hewed him&s;elf one of the mo&s;t excellent princes for ju&s;tice, clemency and moderation. His morals were &s;o pure, that he was u&s;ually compared to Numa, and was &s;urnamed the Pious, both for his tenderne&s;s to his predece&s;&s;or Adrian, when dying, and his particular attach|ment to the religion of his country.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his reign, he made it his particular &s;tudy, to promote only the mo&s;t de&s;erving to employments; he mode|rated many impo&s;ts and tributes, and com|manded that all &s;hould be levied without partiality or oppre&s;&s;ion. His liberality was &s;uch, that he even parted with all his own private fortune, in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the nece&s;&s;itous. Again&s;t which, when Fau&s;tina, the empre&s;s, &s;eemed to remon&s;trate, he repre|hended her folly, alledging, That as &s;oon as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the empire, he quitted all pri|vate intere&s;ts; and having nothing of his own, all properly belonged to the public. He acted differently from his predece&s;&s;ors with regard to travelling, and &s;eldom left Rome, &s;aying, That he was unwilling to burden his &s;ubjects with o&s;tentations and unnece&s;&s;ary expences. By this frugal conduct, he was the better enabled to &s;uppre&s;s all the in&s;urrections that happened during his reign, either in Britain, in Dacia, or in Germany. Thus he was at once reve|renced
<PB N="354" REF="360">
and loved by mankind, being accounted rather a patron, and father of his &s;ubjects, than a ma&s;ter and commander. Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent to him from the remote&s;t parts of Hyrcania, Bactria and India, all offering him their alliance and friend&s;hip; &s;ome de&s;iring him to appoint them a king, whom they &s;eemed proud to obey. He &s;hewed not le&s;s paternal care towards the oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians; in who&s;e favour he declared, That if any &s;hould pro|ceed to di&s;turb them, merely upon the account of their religion, that &s;uch &s;hould undergo the &s;ame puni&s;hment, which was intended again&s;t the accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This clemency was attended with no le&s;s affability and freedom; but, at the &s;ame time, he was upon his guard, that his indulgence to his friends, &s;hould not tempt them into in&s;o|lence or oppre&s;&s;ion. He, therefore, took care, that his courtiers &s;hould not &s;ell their favours, nor take any gratuity from their &s;uitors. In the time of a great famine in Rome, he provided for the wants of the people, and maintained va&s;t numbers with bread and wine all the time of its continuance. When any of his &s;ubjects at|tempted to inflame him with a pa&s;&s;ion for mili|tary glory, he would an&s;wer, That he more de&s;ired the pre&s;ervation of one &s;ubject, than the de&s;truction of a thou&s;and enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="361">
He was an eminent rewarder of learned men, to whom he gave large pen&s;ions and great ho|nours, drawing them from all parts of the world. Among the re&s;t, he &s;ent for Apollo|nius, the famous &s;toic philo&s;opher, to in&s;truct his adopted &s;on, Marcus Aurelius, whom he had previou&s;ly married to his daughter. Apol|lonius being arrived at Rome, the emperor de|&s;ired his attendance; but the other arrogantly an&s;wered, That it was the &s;cholar's duty to wait upon the ma&s;ter, and not the ma&s;ter's upon the &s;cholar. To this reply, Antoninus only returned with a &s;mile, <HI>That it was &s;urpri&s;ing how Apol|lonius, who made no difficulty of coming from Greece to Rome, &s;hould think it &s;o hard to walk from one part of Rome to another;</HI> and immediately &s;ent Marcus Aurelius to him. While the good em|peror was thus employed, in making mankind happy, in directing their conduct by his own example, or reproving their follies with the keene&s;s of rebuke, he was &s;eized with a vio|lent fever at Lorium, a plea&s;ure-hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance from Rome; where, finding him|&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly decaying, he ordered his friends and principal officers to attend him. In their pre&s;ence, he confirmed the adoption of Marcus Aurelius, without once naming Lucius Verus, who had been joined by Adrian with him in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; then commanding the golden &s;tatue of Fortune, which was always in the chamber

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. MARCUS AURELIUS, otherwi&s;e called ANTONI|NUS the PHILOSOPHER, the &s;eventeenth EM|PEROR  of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="914" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="161" UNIT="A.D."> THE death of Antonine was univer&s;ally lamented throughout the empire, and his fu|neral oration, pronounced, as u&s;ual, by his adopted &s;on, Marcus Aurelius; who, though left &s;ole &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne, took Lucius Verus as his a&s;&s;ociate and equal, in govern|ing the &s;tate. Thus Rome, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw it&s;elf governed by two &s;overeigns, of equal power, but of very different merit and preten&s;ions. Aurelius was the &s;on of Annius Verus, of an antient and illu&s;trious family, which claimed its original from Numa. Lucius Verus was the &s;on of Commodus, who had been adopted by Adrian, but died before he &s;ucceeded to the throne. Aurelius was as re|markable for his virtues and accompli&s;hments, as his partner in the empire was, for his ungo|vernable pa&s;&s;ions and debauched morals. The
<PB N="357" REF="363">
one was an example of the greate&s;t goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom; the other, of ignorance, &s;loth, and extravagance.</P>
<P>The two emperors had been &s;carce &s;ettled on the throne, when the empire &s;eemed attacked on every &s;ide, from the barbarous nations by which it was &s;urrounded. The Catti invaded Germany and Rhaetia, ravaging all with fire and &s;word; but were, after &s;ome time, repelled by Victorinus. The Britains likewi&s;e revolted, but were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Califurnius. But the Parthians, under their king Vologe&s;us, made an irruption &s;till more dreadful than either of the former; de&s;troying the Roman legions in Armenia; then entering Syria, and driving out the Roman governor, and filling the whole country with terror and confu&s;ion. In order to &s;top the progre&s;s of this barbarous irruption, Verus him&s;elf went in per&s;on, being accom|panied by Aurelius part of the way, who did all in his power, both by giving him advice and proper attendants, to correct or re&s;train his vices.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e precautions were fruitle&s;s; Verus &s;oon grew weary of all re&s;traint: he neglected every admonition; and, thoughtle&s;s of the urgency of his expedition, plunged him&s;elf into every kind of debauchery. The&s;e exce&s;&s;es brought on a violent fever on his journey, which his con&s;titution was &s;ufficiently &s;trong to
<PB N="358" REF="364">
get over: but nothing could correct his vici|ous inclinations. Upon his entering Antioch, he re&s;olved to give an indulgence to every appetite, without attending to the fatigues of war. Here, in one of its &s;uburbs, which was called Daphne; which, from the &s;weetne&s;s of the air, the beauty of its groves, the richne&s;s of its gardens, and the fre&s;hne&s;s of its fountains, &s;eemed formed for plea&s;ure, he rioted in ex|ce&s;&s;es unknown, even to the voluptuous Greeks; leaving all the glory of the field to his lieute|nants, who were &s;ent to repre&s;s the enemy. The&s;e, however, fought with great &s;ucce&s;s; Sta|tius Pri&s;cus took Artazata; Martius put Volo|ge&s;us to flight, took Seleucia, plundered and burnt Babylon and Cte&s;iphon, and demoli&s;hed the magnificent palace of the kings of Parthia. In a cour&s;e of four years, during which the war continued, the Romans entered far into the Parthian country, and entirely &s;ubdued it; but upon their return, their army was wa&s;ted to le&s;s than half its former number by pe&s;tilence and famine. However, this was no impediment to the vanity of Verus, who re&s;olved to enjoy the honours of a triumph, &s;o hardly earned by others. Wherefore, having appointed a king over the Armenians, and finding the Parthians entirely &s;ubdued, he a&s;&s;umed the titles of Armenicus and Parthicus; and then returned to Rome, to par|take of a triumph with Aurelius, which he
<PB N="359" REF="365">
accordingly &s;olemnized with great pomp and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this expedition, which continued for &s;ome years, Aurelius was &s;edu|lou&s;ly intent upon di&s;tributing ju&s;tice and hap|pine&s;s to his &s;ubjects at home. He fir&s;t applied him&s;elf to the regulation of public affairs, and to the correcting &s;uch faults as he found in the laws and policy of the &s;tate. In this endeavour, he &s;hewed a &s;ingular re&s;pect for the &s;enate, often permitting them to determine without appeal; &s;o that the commonwealth &s;eemed in a manner once more revived under his equitable admini|&s;tration. Be&s;ides, &s;uch was his application to bu|&s;ine&s;s, that he often employed ten days together upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, maturely con&s;idering it on all &s;ides, and &s;eldom departing from the &s;enate hou&s;e till, night coming on, the a&s;&s;embly was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ul. But while thus gloriou&s;ly occupied, he was daily mortified with accounts of the enormities of his colleague; being repeat|edly a&s;&s;ured of his vanity, lewdne&s;s and extrava|gance. However, feigning him&s;elf ignorant of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, he judged marriage to be the be&s;t method of reclaiming him; and therefore &s;ent him his daughter Lucilla, a woman of great beauty, whom Verus married at Antioch. But even this was found ineffectual: Lucilla proved of a di&s;po&s;ition very unlike her father; and, in|&s;tead of correcting her hu&s;band's extravagancies&punc;

only contributed to inflame them. Still, however, Aurelius hoped, that, upon his return, his pre|&s;ence would keep him in awe, and that happi|ne&s;s would, at length, be re&s;tored to the &s;tate. But in this al&s;o he was di&s;appointed. His return only &s;eemed fatal to the empire; for his army carried back the plague from Parthia, and di&s;&s;eminated the infection into all the provinces through which it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the empire &s;hortly after the return of Verus. In this horrid picture was repre&s;ented an emperor, un|awed by example, or the calamities &s;urrounding him, giving way to unheard of debaucheries. A raging pe&s;tilence &s;preading terror and de&s;olation through all parts of the we&s;tern world; earth|quakes&punc; famines, and inundations, &s;uch as had never before happened; the products of the earth, throughout all Italy, devoured by lo|cu&s;ts; all the barbarous nations &s;urrounding the empire, the Germans, the Sarmatians, the Quadi and Marcomanni, taking advantage of its various calamities, and making their irruptions even into Italy it&s;elf. The prie&s;ts doing all they could to put a &s;top to the mi&s;eries of the &s;tate, by attempting to appea&s;e the gods; vowing and offering numberle&s;s &s;acrifices; celebrating all the &s;acred rites that had ever been known in Rome; and exhibiting the &s;olemnity called Lecti&s;ternia, &s;even days together. To crown

the whole, the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts, not &s;atisfied with the impending calamities, making new, by a&s;|cribing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;tate, to the im|pieties of the Chri&s;tians alone; &s;o that a violent per&s;ecution was &s;een reigning in all parts of the empire; in which Ju&s;tin Martyr, St. Polycarp, bi&s;hop of Smyrna, and an infinite number of others, &s;uffered martyrdom.</P>
<P>In this &s;cene of univer&s;al tumult, de&s;olation and di&s;tre&s;s, there was nothing left but the vir|tues and the wi&s;dom of one man alone to re&s;tore tranquility, and bring back happine&s;s to the empire. Aurelius began his endeavours by marching again&s;t the Marcomanni and Quadi, taking Verus with him, who reluctantly left the &s;en&s;ual delights of Rome for the fatigues of a camp. They came up to the Marcomanni near the city of Aquileia, and, after a furious engagement, routed their whole army: then pur&s;uing them acro&s;s the Alpes, overcame them in &s;everal conte&s;ts, and at la&s;t entirely defeat|ing them, returned into Italy without any con|&s;iderable lo&s;s. As the winter was far advanced, <MILESTONE N="922" UNIT="U. C."> <MILESTONE N="169" UNIT="A.D."> Verus was determined upon going from Aqui|leia to Rome, in which journey he was &s;eized with an apoplexy which put an end to his life, being thirty-nine years old, having reign|ed in conjunction with Aurelius nine.

cau&s;es. Some &s;ay that he was poi&s;oned by the empre&s;s Fau&s;tina, &s;ome by his own wife Lu|cilla, who was jealous of him for the pa&s;&s;ion he bore his &s;i&s;ter Fabia: and others &s;till were found to &s;ay that Aurelius had a hand in it; but the number of the&s;e reports ought to de|&s;troy their credibility.</P>
<P>Aurelius, who had hitherto the fatigues of governing not only an empire, but an emperor, being now left to him&s;elf, began to act with greater diligence, and more vigour than ever. His fir&s;t care was to marry his daughter Lu|cilla once more to Claudius Pompeianus, a man of moderate fortune and humble &s;tation, but eminent for his hone&s;ty, courage and wi&s;|dom. He then left Rome to fini&s;h the war again&s;t the Marcomanni, who, joining with the Quadi, the Sarmatians, the Vandals and other barbarous nations, renewed ho&s;tilities, with un|u&s;ual rage and deva&s;tation. They had &s;ome time before attacked Vindex, praefect of the Praetorian bands, and in a general battle near the Danube, de&s;troyed no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and of his men. They even pur&s;ued the Romans as far as Aquileia, and would have taken the city, had not the emperor led his troops in per&s;on to oppo&s;e them. Aurelius having repul&s;ed the enemy, continued his endeavours to repre&s;s them from future inroads. He &s;pent in this laborious undertaking no le&s;s than
<PB N="363" REF="369">
five years, harra&s;&s;ing the&s;e barbarous nations, &s;upporting the mo&s;t dreadful fatigues, and &s;upplying, by the exce&s;s of his courage, the defects of a delicate con&s;titution. The &s;toic philo&s;ophy, in which he was bred, had taught him a &s;implicity of living, which &s;erved as an example to the whole army. The common &s;oldier could not murmur at any hard&s;hips he was put upon, when he &s;aw the emperor him&s;elf every hour undergoing greater au&s;terities with chearful re&s;ignation. By this conduct, Aure|lius &s;o wearied out the enemy with repeated attacks, that he at la&s;t con&s;trained them to ac|cept of &s;uch terms of peace as he thought fit to impo&s;e, and thus returned in triumph to Rome.</P>
<P>Upon the emperor's return to Rome, he be|gan his u&s;ual endeavours to benefit mankind by a farther reformation of the internal policy of the &s;tate. He ordered that no enquiry &s;hould be made after the fortune of decea&s;ed per&s;ons who had been dead five years. He moderated the public expences, and le&s;&s;ened the number of &s;hows and &s;ports which were exhibited on the amphitheatre. He particu|larly took the poor under his protection; he found &s;uch plea&s;ure in relieving their wants, that he con&s;idered his ability to &s;upply the dic|tates of his compa&s;&s;ion, as one of the greate&s;t happine&s;&s;es of his life. He laboured ince&s;&s;antly
<PB N="364" REF="370">
to re&s;train the luxuries of the great, he prohi|bited the u&s;e of chariots and litters to per&s;ons of inferior &s;tation, and endeavoured by all means to correct the lewdne&s;s and di&s;orders of women.</P>
<P>But his good endeavours were &s;oon inter|rupted by a renewal of the former war. The barbarians no &s;ooner perceived his army with|drawn, than they took up arms once more, and renewed their ravages with greater fury than before. They had now drawn over to their &s;ide all the nations from Illyricum, to the furthe&s;t parts of Gaul. Aurelius, there|fore, again &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with diffi|culties; his army had been wa&s;ted by plague, and frequent engagements, and his trea&s;ures entirely exhau&s;ted. In order to remedy the&s;e inconveniencies, he increa&s;ed his army, by in|li&s;ting &s;laves, gladiators, and the banditti of Dalmatia. To rai&s;e money, he &s;old all the moveables belonging to the empire, and all the rich furniture which had been depo&s;ited in the cabinets of Adrian. This &s;ale, which conti|nued for two months, produced &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um, as to defray all the expences of the war. His next effort was to march forward, and cro&s;s the Danube by a bridge of boats. He then attacked the enemy, gained &s;everal advantages, burnt their hou&s;es and magazines of corn, and received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of &s;uch, as had
<PB N="365" REF="371">
incon&s;iderately joined in the inva&s;ion. The detail of his campaigns is but confu&s;edly related by hi&s;torians; one battle, in particular, is men|tioned, which might have proved fatal, had not &s;ome mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing accidents interpo&s;ed. This engagement was begun by the enemy's &s;lingers acro&s;s a river, which induced the Ro|mans to cro&s;s it, and make a great &s;laughter of tho&s;e, who attempted to defend its banks on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. The enemy judging they &s;hould be pur&s;ued, retired, previou&s;ly leaving &s;ome bo|dies of archers, covered by a &s;quadron of hor&s;e, to &s;kirmi&s;h with the Romans, as though they de&s;igned to &s;top their progre&s;s. The Romans, with incon&s;iderate valour, attacking this for|lorn hope, pur&s;ued them among a chain of barren mountains; where they found them&s;elves unexpectedly blocked up on every &s;ide. How|ever, they continued fighting, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantage of the place; but the enemy, prudently declined engaging, not willing to leave that victory to chance, which they ex|pected from delay. At length, the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the inclo&s;ed &s;ituation, the fatigues of long employment, together with a violent thir&s;t, totally di&s;heartened the legions. They now found, that they could neither fight nor retreat; and that they mu&s;t run upon certain danger, or become a prey to their barbarous enemies. In this deplorable exigence, while
<PB N="366" REF="372">
&s;orrow and de&s;pair were their only companions, Aurelius ran through their ranks, and in vain endeavoured to re-kindle their hopes and their courage. Nothing was heard but groans and lamentations: nothing &s;een but marks of terror and de&s;olation. At this dreadful juncture, and ju&s;t as the barbarians were ready to fall upon them, we are a&s;&s;ured, by &s;ome writers, that the &s;olemn prayers of a Chri&s;tian legion which was among them, produced &s;uch a fall of rain, as in&s;tantly refre&s;hed the fainting army. The &s;oldiers were &s;een holding their mouths and their helmets up to Heaven, and receiving the &s;how|ers which came &s;o wonderfully to their relief. The &s;ame clouds al&s;o which &s;erved for their re&s;|cue, at the &s;ame time di&s;charged &s;uch a terri|ble &s;torm of hail, accompanied with thunder, again&s;t the enemy, as a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded them. By this unlooked for aid, the Romans recovering &s;trength and courage, once more turned upon their pur&s;uers, and cut them in pieces.</P>
<P>Such are the circum&s;tances of an engage|ment, acknowledged by pagan, as well as chri&s;tian writers, only with this difference, that the latter a&s;cribe the victory to their own, the former to the prayers of their emperor. How|ever this be, Aurelius &s;eemed &s;o &s;en&s;ible of miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he immediately re|laxed the per&s;ecution again&s;t the Chri&s;tians,
<PB N="367" REF="373">
and wrote to the &s;enate in favour of their reli|gion. Notwith&s;tanding this victory, the war continued for &s;ome months longer; but after many violent conflicts, the barbarians &s;ent to &s;ue for peace. The emperor impo&s;ed condi|tions upon them, more or le&s;s &s;evere, as he found them more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to revolt; being actually re&s;olved to divide their terri|tories into provinces, and &s;ubject them to the Roman empire. However, a fre&s;h rebellion called him to the defence of his dominions at home.</P>
<P>Avidius Ca&s;&s;ius was one of the emperor's mo&s;t favourite generals, and had been chiefly in&s;trumental in obtaining the Roman &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Parthia. His principal merit &s;eemed to con|&s;i&s;t in his re&s;toring the old di&s;cipline, and in pre|tending a violent regard for the commonwealth in its antient form. However, all his &s;eeming regard for freedom, was only to &s;eize upon the liberties of his country for his own aggrandi&s;e|ment. Wherefore, finding his &s;oldiers (for he was left with an army in the Ea&s;t) willing to &s;up|port his preten&s;ions, he proclaimed him&s;elf em|peror in Syria. One of his chief artifices to pro|cure popularity was, his giving out, that he was de&s;cended from the famous Ca&s;&s;ius, who had con|&s;pired again&s;t Cae&s;ar; and, like him, he pretended, that his aims were for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the commonwealth of Rome. He al&s;o cau&s;ed it to be
<PB N="368" REF="374">
rumoured, that Aurelius was dead, and affected to &s;hew the greate&s;t re&s;pect for his memory. By the&s;e pretences, he united a large body of men under his command, and, in a &s;hort time, brought all the countries from Syria to mount Taurus, under his &s;ubjection. The&s;e pro&s;pe|rous beginnings &s;erved to increa&s;e the empe|ror's activity, but not his apprehen&s;ions. He prepared to oppo&s;e him without any marks of unea&s;ine&s;s for the event; telling his &s;oldiers, That he could freely yield up his empire to Avi|dius, if it &s;hould be judged conducive to the public good; for, as to his own part, the only fruits he had from exaltation, were ince&s;&s;ant labour and fatigue. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am ready," cried he, "to meet Avidius before the &s;enate, and before you; and to yield him up the empire, without the effu&s;ion of blood, or &s;triking a blow, if it &s;hall be thought good for the people. But Avidius will never &s;ubmit to &s;uch a tribunal; he who has been faithle&s;s to his benefactor, can never rely upon any man's profe&s;&s;ions. He will not even, in ca&s;e of being wor&s;ted, rely upon me. And yet, my fellow &s;oldiers, my only fear is, and I &s;peak it with the greate&s;t &s;incerity, le&s;t he &s;hould put an end to his own life; or le&s;t &s;ome, thinking to do me a &s;ervice, &s;hould ha&s;ten his death. The greate&s;t hope that I have, is to prove, that I can pardon the
<PB N="369" REF="375">
mo&s;t outrageous offences, to make him my friend, even in &s;pite of his reluctance; and to &s;hew the world, that civil wars them|&s;elves can come to an happy i&s;&s;ue."</Q> In the mean time, he, who well knew, that de&s;perate undertakings, mu&s;t have a &s;peedy execution, endeavoured to draw over Greece to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; but the love which all mankind bore the good emperor, fru&s;trated his expectations; he was unable to bring over a &s;ingle city to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts. This repul&s;e &s;eemed to turn the &s;cale of his former fortunes. His offi|cers and &s;oldiers began now to regard him with contempt, and at la&s;t &s;lew him, in le&s;s than four months after having fir&s;t revolted. His head was brought to the emperor, who re|ceived it with regret, and ordered it an ho|nourable interment. The re&s;t of the con&s;pi|rators were treated with great lenity; &s;ome few or them were bani&s;hed, but recalled &s;oon after. This clemency was admired by &s;ome, and con|demned by others; but the emperor little re|garded the murmurs or the applau&s;e of the multitude; guided only by the goodne&s;s of his own di&s;po&s;ition, he did what, to him, &s;eemed right; content and happy in &s;elf-approbation. When &s;ome took the liberty of blaming his conduct, telling him, That Avidius would not have been &s;o generous, had he been con|queror; the emperor replied in this &s;ublime
<PB N="370" REF="376">
manner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never &s;erved the gods &s;o ill, or reigned &s;o irregularly, as to fear Avidius could ever be conqueror."</Q></P>
<P>Though Avidius was no more, yet Aurelius was &s;en&s;ible that he had &s;till &s;ome friends re|maining, whom he was willing to win over. He therefore took a journey into the Ea&s;t, where, in all places, he at once charmed them with his affability, rai&s;ed their admiration by his clemency, in&s;tructed them by precept, and improved them by his example. The better to prevent &s;uch revolts for the future, he ordained, That as Avidus was a native of the country in which he rebelled, no per&s;on, for the future, &s;hould command in the place where he was born. In this journey, the empre&s;s Fau&s;tina, was unexpectedly &s;eized with a violent di&s;tem|per, and died. She was a woman, who&s;e wanton life gave great &s;candal to the dignity of her &s;tation; however, her pa&s;&s;ive hu&s;band, either could not, or, at lea&s;t, affected not, to &s;ee her enormities; and willingly admitted the ill de&s;erved honours, which the &s;enate impor|tunately decreed to her memory.</P>
<P>In his way to Rome, he vi&s;ited Athens, were he conferred many honours on the inha|bitants, and e&s;tabli&s;hed profe&s;&s;ors in all the &s;ciences, with munificent &s;alaries for their ea&s;e. Upon landing in Italy, he quitted his &s;oldier's habit, as al&s;o did all his army; and made his
<PB N="371" REF="377">
entry into Rome in the gown which was worn in peace. As he had been ab&s;ent almo&s;t eight years, he di&s;tributed to each citizen eight pieces of gold, and remitted all the debts due to the trea&s;ury for &s;ixty years pa&s;t. At the &s;ame time he nominated his &s;on Commodus, to &s;ucceed him in the empire, and made him a partner in his triumphal entry. He then re|tired for &s;ome time to a country &s;eat into the arms of philo&s;ophy, which delighted his mind, and guided his conduct: he u&s;ually called it his mother, in oppo&s;ition to the court, which he con&s;idered as his &s;tep-mother. He al&s;o was frequently heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the people were happy who&s;e philo&s;ophers were kings, or who&s;e kings were philo&s;ophers."</Q> He, in fact, was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men then in being; and though he had been born in the meane&s;t &s;tation, his merits, as a writer, would have in&s;ured him immortality. But it was not with him mere &s;peculation, his practice was entirely guided by the principles of &s;toici&s;m; &s;o that his tranquility was &s;uch, that he was never ob&s;erved to feel any emotion, or to change countenance, either in joy or &s;orrow. His chief ma&s;ters were, Appollonius of Chalcis; and Sextus Cheronen&s;is, grand&s;on to the famous Plutarch; the&s;e &s;hared his bounty, as likewi&s;e did all the learned men of his time. He had learned the art of &s;o blending liberality with
<PB N="372" REF="378">
the mo&s;t frugal oeconomy, that he &s;eemed ra|ther the equitable guardian of another's wealth, than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his own. He was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible, that few under&s;tood the art of giving, that he built a temple to the godde&s;s who pre|&s;ided over benefits.</P>
<P>In this manner, having re&s;tored pro&s;perity to his &s;ubjects, and peace to mankind, he ex|pected, in the decline of life, to re&s;t from fu|ture toil. But it was his fortune to be ever em|ployed. News was brought him, that the Scythians, and barbarous nations of the North, were again up in arms, and invading the empire with furious impetuo&s;ity. He now, therefore, once more re&s;olved, to expo&s;e his aged per&s;on in the defence of his country, and made &s;peedy preparations to oppo&s;e them. He went to the &s;enate, for the fir&s;t time, and de&s;ired to have money out of the public trea&s;ury. Though it was in his power to take what &s;ums he thought proper without their con&s;ent, yet he openly declared, That emperors had no private pro|perty, not &s;o much as the palace in which they dwelt. The people, who&s;e love to the empe|ror daily increa&s;ed, finding him making pre|parations to leave them, and re&s;olving to expo&s;e him&s;elf in a dangerous war, a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves before his palace, be&s;eeching him not to depart, till he had given them in&s;tructions for their future conduct; &s;o that if the gods &s;hould take
<PB N="373" REF="379">
him to them&s;elves, they might, by his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, continue in the &s;ame paths of virtue, into which he had led them by his example. This was a reque&s;t which the good emperor was highly plea&s;ed in obeying; he &s;pent three whole days in giving them &s;hort maxims, by which they might regulate their lives; and, having fini&s;hed his lectures, departed upon his expedi|tion, amid&s;t the prayers and lamentations of all his &s;ubjects. The particulars of the&s;e cam|paigns are not related by hi&s;torians; we can only &s;ay, that he fought &s;everal bloody battles, where the victory was always owing to his pru|dence, courage, and example. He was con|&s;tantly at the head of his men, and always in places the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger. He built &s;everal forts, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed his garri&s;ons, as to keep all his barbarous neighbours in awe. It was upon going to open his third campaign, that he was &s;eized with the plague at Vienna, which &s;topped the progre&s;s of his &s;ucce&s;s. No|thing, however, could abate his de&s;ire of be|ing beneficial to mankind; for though his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the will of Providence, made him meet the approaches of death with tranquility, his fears for the youth and unpromi&s;ing di&s;po|&s;ition of Commodus, his &s;on, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;eemed to give him great unea&s;ine&s;s, and aggra|vated the pains of nature. Struggling with this apprehen&s;ion, and fluctuating between hope
<PB N="374" REF="380">
and fear, he addre&s;&s;ed his friends and the princi|pal officers that were gathered round his bed; telling them, That as his &s;on was now going to lo&s;e a father, he hoped he &s;hould find many fathers in them. That they would direct his youth, and give him &s;uch in&s;tructions as would be to the public benefit as well as his own. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Make him more particularly &s;en&s;ible," con|tinued the dying emperor, "That not all the riches and honours of this world, are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the luxury and ambition of a ty|rant; nor are the &s;tronge&s;t guards and armies able to defend them from the ju&s;t reward of their crimes. A&s;&s;ure him, that cruel princes never enjoy a long and peaceful reign; and that all the real delights of power, are re|&s;erved only for tho&s;e, who&s;e clemency and mildne&s;s have gained the hearts of their peo|ple. It mu&s;t be yours to inform him, that obedience by con&s;traint, is never &s;incere; and that he who would expect fidelity among mankind, mu&s;t gain it from their affections, not their fears. Lay before him the diffi|culty, and yet the nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;etting bounds to his pa&s;&s;ions, as there are none &s;et to his power. The&s;e are the truths to which he ought ever to attend; by &s;teadily inculcating the&s;e, you will have the &s;atisfaction of form|ing a good prince, and the plea&s;ure of pay|ing my memory the noble&s;t of all &s;ervices,
<PB N="375" REF="381">
&s;ince you will thus render it immortal."</Q> As he was &s;peaking the&s;e la&s;t words, he was &s;eized with a weakne&s;s which &s;topped his utterance, and brought him to his end the day following. He died in the fifty-ninth year of his age, having reigned nineteen years and &s;ome days.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as if the whole glory and pro&s;pe|rity of the Roman empire died with Aurelius. From hence forward we are to behold a train of emperors either vicious or impotent, either wilfully guilty, or unable to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of their &s;tation. We are to behold an empire, grown too great, &s;inking by its own weight, &s;urrounded by barbarous and &s;ucce&s;sful ene|mies without, and torn by ambitious and cruel factions within. The principles of the times wholly corrupted; philo&s;ophy attempt|ing to regulate the minds of men without the aid of religion, and the warmth of patrioti&s;m entirely evaporated, by being diffu&s;ed in too wide a circle. We &s;hall &s;till farther find the people becoming dull, as they grow impotent; their hi&s;torians cool and &s;piritle&s;s in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting narrations, and the convul&s;ions of the greate&s;t empire upon earth, de&s;cribed in childi&s;h points, or languid prolixity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XIX.  COMMODUS, the eighteenth EMPEROR of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="923" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE UNIT="A.D."> THE merits of Aurelius procured Com|modus an ea&s;y acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. He was acknowledged emperor, fir&s;t by the army, then by the &s;enate and people, and &s;hortly after by all the provinces. But though he owed the empire to the adoption of his &s;uppo&s;ed father, many were of opinion, that he was the &s;purious i&s;&s;ue of a gladiator; his own conduct afterward, and the wanton character of his mother Fau&s;ti|na, having, perhaps, given ri&s;e to the report. He was about nineteen years of age when he entered upon the empire; his per&s;on was come|ly and robu&s;t: no man was more expert in all bodily exerci&s;es than he; he frequently fought with gladiators, and always came off victori|ous; he threw the javelin, and &s;hot from the bow with &s;uch wonderful expertne&s;s, as almo&s;t exceeded credibility. He never mi&s;&s;ed hitting and killing the fleete&s;t animals, though upon full &s;peed, and this in any part of their bodies he thought fit. He killed, upon a certain oc|ca&s;ion, an hundred lions let loo&s;e all at once upon the amphitheatre. He &s;hot birds, flying
<PB N="377" REF="383">
in the air, with unerring aim, and cut off the heads of an hundred o&s;triches, in their mo&s;t rapid motion, with his arrows headed in the &s;hape of an half moon.</P>
<P>But it had been happy for him&s;elf and man|kind, if he had cultivated the mental exerci&s;es with as much attention as tho&s;e of the body. His whole reign is but a ti&s;&s;ue of wanton|ne&s;s and folly, cruelty and inju&s;tice, rapacity and corruption. There is &s;o &s;trong a &s;imili|tude between his conduct, and that of Domi|tian, that a reader might be apt to imagine he was going over the &s;ame reign.</P>
<P>He was received, upon his entrance into Rome, with a tran&s;port of applau&s;e from the peo|ple, and, for &s;ome time, he &s;hewed him&s;elf wor|thy of their affection. But &s;oon the levity of his temper, and the corrupt example of his favou|rite companions, turned him to the ba&s;e&s;t, meane&s;t pur&s;uits. He went with his a&s;&s;ociates to taverns and brothels; &s;pent the day in fea&s;ting, and the night in the mo&s;t abominable lux|uries, having no le&s;s than three hundred fe|males, and as many males, for dete&s;table purpo&s;es. He committed ince&s;t, as Caligula did, with all his &s;i&s;ters. He &s;ometimes went about the markets in a frolic, with &s;mall wares, as a petty chapman; &s;ometimes he immitated an hor&s;e-cour&s;er; and, at other times, drove his own chariot in a &s;lave's habit.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="384">
Tho&s;e he chiefly promoted re&s;embled him|&s;elf, being the companions of his plea&s;ures, or the mini&s;ters of his cruelty. He took little care of the government, devolving all the conduct of it upon one Perennius, a per&s;on, chiefly re|markable for his avarice and cruelty. In con&s;e|quence of the enormities of this mini&s;ter, a con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t Commodus in the beginning of his reign, in which his &s;i&s;ter Lu|cilla, with her hu&s;band Pompeianus, were prin|cipally concerned. The per&s;on employed to kill the emperor was one Quintianus, who coming up to him in a dauntle&s;s manner, and holding up his dagger, cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;e|nate &s;ends thee this."</Q> But this unguarded manner of proceeding fru&s;trated his aim; for one of the guards ju&s;t then &s;eizing his arm, pre|vented the fatal blow, and he, &s;oon after, made a di&s;covery of all his accomplices. Lucilla, Pompeianus and Quintianus were executed; many other per&s;ons, wholly innocent, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and Perennius proceeded &s;acrificing numbers of the &s;enate, as pretended accom|plices, but in reality with a view of &s;eizing upon their e&s;tates and fortunes. Being thus grown ex|tremely rich, he began to think of gaining the empire for him&s;elf, and made &s;ome progre&s;s in the attempt; but his de&s;ign becoming appa|rent, Commodus &s;eemed to rouze from his lethargy, and ordered both him and his &s;ons,
<PB N="379" REF="385">
who had been &s;ent to draw the legions to re|volt, for immediate execution.</P>
<P>Two con&s;piracies, thus di&s;covered and pu|ni&s;hed, only &s;erved to render the emperor &s;till more cruel and &s;u&s;picious, and the&s;e cruelties begot new revolts. One Maternus, at the head of a numerous banditti, wa&s;ted Spain and Gaul, and re&s;olved to attempt the empire it&s;elf. In order to effect this, upon a certain fe&s;tival, he ordered &s;ome of his &s;oldiers to mix with the emperor's guards, and then a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. But his own party, in hopes of advantage, be|trayed their employer, and he was executed, with many others, &s;oon after. It was about this time al&s;o, that Cleander, the emperor's chief favourite, fell a &s;acrifice to the indig|nation of the populace, for his haughty carriage towards them. Another favourite, who&s;e name was Julian, was put to death by the emperor's command; and &s;hortly after a third (for this vicious prince could not reign without a fa|vourite) who was called Regillius, was exe|cuted in the &s;ame manner. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded the murder of his wife Cri&s;pina, and his fa|ther's cou&s;in german, Fau&s;tina, and numberle&s;s others, who&s;e virtues, or fortunes, rendered them obnoxious to his capricious cruelty. If any per&s;on de&s;ired to be revenged on an enemy, by bargaining with Commodus for a &s;um of mo|ney, he was permitted to de&s;troy him in &s;uch
<PB N="380" REF="386">
manner as he thought proper. He commanded a per&s;on to be ca&s;t to the wild bea&s;ts, for read|ing the life of Caligula in Suetonius. He com|manded another to be thrown into a burning furnace, for accidentally over-heating his bath. He would &s;ometimes, in a good humour, cut off mens no&s;es, under a pretence of &s;having their beards; and was him&s;elf &s;o jealous of all mankind, that he was obliged to be his own barber.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e cruelties his vanity ne|ver for&s;ook him. In&s;tead of being content with numberle&s;s titles, which his flattering &s;enate were daily offering, he was rather willing to a&s;|&s;ume &s;uch as were mo&s;t agreeable to him&s;elf. He, at one time, commanded him&s;elf to be &s;tyled, Hercules, the &s;on of Jupiter; and, the better to immitate that hero, he carried a club, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a lion's &s;kin. But to drive the immitation as far as po&s;&s;ible, and that he might appear to de&s;troy giants and mon&s;ters, as the former had done, he dre&s;&s;ed up &s;everal poor men and cripples, which were found begging in the &s;treets, like mon&s;ters, giving them &s;ponges to throw at him in&s;tead of &s;tones, and falling fu|riou&s;ly among them with his club, he de&s;troyed them all. When tired of the Herculean habit, he a&s;&s;umed that of an Amazon. He, at la&s;t, became &s;o abandoned as to for&s;ake his palace, and live in a fencing-&s;chool; and, &s;atiated with
<PB N="381" REF="387">
all his former titles, he a&s;&s;umed the name of a famous gladiator.</P>
<P>During the&s;e deplorable irregularities, the barbarians on the frontiers of the empire were daily gaining ground; and though his lieute|nants were &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Britains, the Moors, the Dacians, the Germans and Panno|nians, yet the empire was daily declining, &s;ince their numbers &s;eemed to increa&s;e by defeat, &s;o that neither treaties could bind, nor victories repel them. In the mean time, the emperor's actions were become &s;o odious to all mankind, and &s;o contemptible to the citizens of Rome, that his death was ardently de&s;ired by all. At length, upon the fea&s;t of Janus, re&s;olving to fence naked before the people, as a common gladiator, three of his friends remon&s;trated to him upon the indecency of &s;uch a behaviour. The&s;e were Laetius, his general, Electus, his chamberlain, and Marcia, a concubine, of whom he always appeared exce&s;&s;ively fond. Their ad|vice was attended with no other effect, than that of incen&s;ing him again&s;t them, and inciting him to re&s;olve upon their de&s;truction. It was his method, as well as Domitian's, to put down the names of all &s;uch as he intended to put to death, in a roll, which he carefully kept by him. However, at this time, happening to place it upon his bed, while he was bathing in an|other room, it was taken up by a little boy,
<PB N="382" REF="388">
whom he pa&s;&s;ionately loved, who, playing with it for &s;ome time, brought it to Marcia, who was in&s;tantly alarmed at the contents. She immediately di&s;covered it to Laetus and Electus, who perceiving their dangerous &s;ituation, in|&s;tantly re&s;olved the tyrant's death. After &s;ome deliberation, it was agreed upon to di&s;patch him by poi&s;on. In con&s;equence of this, a draught, probably opium, was admini&s;tered to him by the hands of Marcia, which beginning to operate, ca&s;t him into a heavy &s;lumber. In order to conceal the fact, &s;he immediately cau&s;ed the company to retire, under pretence of allowing him re&s;t; but finding him awake &s;oon after, and taken with a violent vomiting, &s;he was greatly alarmed with fears of his recovery. In this exigence, con&s;ulting with the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators, &s;he ha&s;tily introduced a young man, called Narci&s;&s;us, and &s;hewing him his own name, among the number of tho&s;e whom Commodus had de&s;tined to de&s;truction, &s;he prevailed upon him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;patching him. He boldly undertook the dangerous ta&s;k, &s;o that the emperor was &s;oon &s;trangled by their united efforts. In this manner died Commodus, in the thirty-fir&s;t year of his age, after an im|pious reign of twelve years and nine months; and, as if the example was given by him, few of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors e&s;caped a violent death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. PERTINAX, the nineteenth EMPEROR of Rome. </HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="945" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="192" UNIT="A.D."> THE &s;ecrecy and expedition with which  Commodus was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated were &s;uch, that few were at that time, acquainted with the real circum&s;tances of his death. His body was wrapped up as a bale of u&s;ele&s;s furniture, and carried through the guards, mo&s;t of which were either drunk or &s;leeping.</P>
<P>But previous to their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the con&s;pi|rators had fixed upon a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This was Hel|vius Pertinax, who&s;e virtues and courage render|ed him worthy of the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation. This extraordinary per&s;onage had pa&s;&s;ed thro' many changes of fortune. He was originally the &s;on of an enfranchi&s;ed &s;lave, called Aelius, who only gave him &s;o much learning as to qualify him for keeping a little &s;hop in the city. He then became a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, afterwards &s;tudi|ed the law, and after that became a &s;oldier; in which &s;tation his behaviour was &s;uch, as to be &s;oon made captain of a cohort again&s;t the Parthians. Being thus introduced to arms, he went through the u&s;ual gradations of military
<PB N="384" REF="390">
preferment in Britain, and Me&s;ia, until he be|came the commander of a legion under Aure|lius. In this &s;tation he performed &s;uch excel|lent &s;ervices again&s;t the barbarians, that he was made con&s;ul, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively governor of Da|cia, Syria and A&s;ia Minor. In the reign of Commodus he was bani&s;hed, &s;oon after re|called, and &s;ent into Britain to reform the abu&s;es of the army. In this employment his u&s;ual extraordinary fortune attended him: he was oppo&s;ed by a &s;edition among the legions, and left for dead among many others that were &s;lain. However, he got over this danger, &s;e|verely puni&s;hed the mutineers, and e&s;tabli&s;hed regularity and di&s;cipline among the troops he was &s;ent to command. From thence he was removed into Africa, where the &s;edition of the &s;oldiers had like to have been as fatal to him as in his former government. Removing from Africa, and fatigued with an active life, he betook him&s;elf to retirement; but Commodus, willing to keep him &s;till in view, made him praefect of the city; which employment he filled, when the con&s;pirators fixed upon him, as the propere&s;t per&s;on to &s;ucceed to the empire.</P>
<P>His being advanced by Commodus only &s;erved to increa&s;e his fears of falling as an ob|ject of his &s;u&s;picions; when, therefore, the con&s;pirators repaired to his hou&s;e by night, he con&s;idered their arrival as a command from the
<PB N="385" REF="391">
emperor for his death. Upon Laetus entering his apartment, Pertinax, without any &s;hew of fear, cried out, That for many days he had expected to end his life in that manner, won|dering that the emperor had deferred it &s;o long. However, he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when in|formed of the real cau&s;e of their vi&s;it; and be|ing &s;trongly urged to accept of the empire, he, at la&s;t, complied with their offer.</P>
<P>Being carried to the camp, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor, &s;oon after the citizens and &s;enate con&s;ented; their joy for the election of their new &s;overeign being &s;carce equal to that for the death of the former. They pronounced Commodus a parricide; an enemy to the gods, his country and all mankind; and commanded, that his coar&s;e &s;hould rot upon a dunghill. In the mean time, they &s;aluted Pertinax as em|peror and Cae&s;ar, with numerous acclamations, and chearfully took the oaths of obedience. The provinces &s;oon after followed the example of Rome, &s;o that he began his reign with uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction to the whole empire, being in the &s;ixty-eighth year of his age.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of this monarch's reign, the &s;hort time it conti|nued. He puni&s;hed all tho&s;e who had &s;erved to corrupt the late emperor, and di&s;po&s;ed of his ill got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to public u&s;es. He attempted to re&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Praetorian
<PB N="386" REF="392">
bands, and put a &s;top to the injuries and in&s;o|lencies they committed again&s;t the people. He &s;old mo&s;t of the buffoons and je&s;ters of Com|modus as &s;laves; particularly &s;uch as had ob|&s;cene names. He continually frequented the &s;enate as often as it &s;ate, and never refu&s;ed an audience, even to the meane&s;t of the people. His &s;ucce&s;s in foreign affairs was equal to his internal policy. When the barbarous nations abroad had certain intelligence that he was em|peror, they immediately laid down their arms, well knowing the oppo&s;ition they were to ex|pect from &s;o experienced a commander. His great error was avarice, and that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to ha&s;ten his ruin.</P>
<P>The Praetorian &s;oldiers, who&s;e manners he had attempted to reform, having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profu&s;ion of their former monarch, began to hate him, for the par&s;imony and di&s;cipline he had introduced among them. They therefore re&s;olved to de|throne him; and, for that purpo&s;e, declared Maternus, an ancient &s;enator, emperor, and endeavoured to carry him to the camp to pro|claim him. Maternus, however, was too ju&s;t to the merits of Pertinax, and too faithful a &s;ub|ject, to concur in their &s;editious de&s;igns; where|fore, e&s;caping out of their hands, he fled, fir&s;t to the emperor, and then out of the city. They then nominated one Falco, another &s;enator,
<PB N="387" REF="393">
whom the &s;enate would have ordered for exe|cution, had not Pertinax interpo&s;ed, who de|clared, That, during his reign, no &s;enator &s;hould &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>The Praetorian &s;oldiers then re&s;olved unani|mou&s;ly not to u&s;e any &s;ecret con&s;piracies, or pri|vate contrivances, but boldly to &s;eize upon the emperor and empire at once. They accordingly, in a tumultuous manner, marched through the &s;treets of Rome, and entered the palace with|out oppo&s;ition. Such was the terror of their approach, that the greate&s;t part of the empe|ror's attendants for&s;ook him; while tho&s;e who remained, earne&s;tly intreated him to fly to the body of the people, and intere&s;t them in his defence. However, he rejected their advice, declaring, That it was unworthy his imperial dignity, and all his pa&s;t actions, to &s;ave him|&s;elf by flight. Having thus re&s;olved to face the rebels, he had &s;ome hopes, that his pre|&s;ence alone, would terrify and confound them. But what could his former virtues, or the dig|nity of command, avail again&s;t a tumultuous rabble, nur&s;ed up in vice, and mini&s;ters of former tyranny? One Thau&s;ias, a Tungrian, &s;truck him with his launce on the brea&s;t, crying out, "The &s;oldiers &s;end you this." Pertinax find|ing all was over, covered his head with his robe, and &s;unk down, mangled with a multi|tude of wounds, which he received from various
<PB N="388" REF="394">
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Electus, and &s;ome more of his at|tendants, who attempted to defend him, were al&s;o &s;lain: his &s;on and daughter only e&s;caped, who happened to be lodged out of the palace. Thus, after a reign of three months, Pertinax fell a &s;acrifice to the licentious fury of the Prae|torian army. From the number of his adven|tures, he was called the Tennis-ball of Fortune, and certainly no man ever experienced &s;uch a variety of &s;ituation, with &s;o blamele&s;s a cha|racter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. DIDIUS JULIAN, the Twentieth EMPEROR of  ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="945" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="192" UNIT="A.D."> THE &s;oldiers having committed this out|rage, retired with great precipitation, and getting out of the city to the re&s;t of their com|panions, expeditiou&s;ly fortified their camp, ex|pecting to be attacked by the citizens. Two days having pa&s;&s;ed without any attempt of the kind, they became more in&s;olent; and, willing to make u&s;e of the power of which they found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, made proclamation, That they would &s;ell the empire to whoever would purcha&s;e it at the highe&s;t price. In con|&s;equence of this proclamation, &s;o odious and
<PB N="389" REF="395">
unju&s;t, only two bidders were found; namely, Sulpician and Didius. The former, a con&s;u|lar per&s;on, praefect of the city, and &s;on-in-law to the late emperor Pertinax. The latter, a con&s;ular per&s;on likewi&s;e, a great lawyer, and the wealthie&s;t man in the city. He was &s;itting with &s;ome friends at dinner when the procla|mation was publi&s;hed; and being charmed with the pro&s;pect of unbounded power, imme|diately ro&s;e from the table, and ha&s;tened to the camp. Sulpician was got there before him; but as he had rather promi&s;es, than trea&s;ure, to be&s;tow, the offers of Didius, who produced immen&s;e &s;ums of ready money, prevailed. He was received into the camp by a ladder, and they in&s;tantly &s;wore to obey him as emperor. From the camp he was attended by his new electors into the city; the whole body of his guards, which con&s;i&s;ted of ten thou&s;and men, ranged around him in &s;uch order, as if they had prepared for battle, and not for a peaceable ceremony. The citizens, however, refu&s;ed to confirm his election, but rather cur&s;ed him as he pa&s;&s;ed. Upon being conducted to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, he addre&s;&s;ed the few &s;enators that were pre&s;ent in a very laconic &s;peech. <HI>Fathers, you want an emperor, and I am the fitte&s;t per&s;on you can chu&s;e.</HI> But even this, &s;hort as it &s;eems, was unne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the &s;enate had it not in their power to refu&s;e their approbation. His &s;peech being
<PB N="390" REF="396">
backed by the army, to whom he had given about a million of our money, &s;ucceeded. The choice of the &s;oldiers was confirmed by the &s;e|nate, and Didius was acknowledged emperor, now in the fifty-&s;eventh year of his age.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem by this weak monarch's con|duct, when &s;eated on the throne, that he thought the government of an empire rather a plea&s;ure, than a toil. In&s;tead of attempting to gain the hearts of his &s;ubjects, he gave him&s;elf up to ea&s;e and inactivity, utterly regardle&s;s of the duties of his &s;tation. He was mild and gentle indeed, neither injuring any, nor expect|ing to be injured. But that avarice, by which he became oppulent, &s;till followed him in his exaltation; &s;o that the very &s;oldiers who elected him, &s;oon began to dete&s;t him for tho&s;e quali|ties, &s;o very oppo&s;ite to a military character. The people al&s;o, again&s;t who&s;e con&s;ent he was cho&s;en, were not le&s;s inimical. Whenever he i&s;&s;ued from his palace, they openly poured forth their imprecations again&s;t him, crying out, That he was a thief, and had &s;tolen the empire. Didius, however, in the true &s;pirit of a trader, patiently bore it all, &s;ometimes beckoning them, with &s;miles, to approach him, and te&s;tifying his regard by every kind of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While Didius was thus contemptuou&s;ly treated at home, two valiant generals, in dif|ferent parts of the empire, di&s;claimed his au|thority,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
and boldly re&s;olved to &s;trike at the throne for them&s;elves. The&s;e were, Pe&s;cennius Niger, governor of Syria; and Septimius Se|verus, commander of the German legions. Niger was beloved by the people for his cle|mency and valour; and the report of his pro|po&s;ing Pertinax for his model, and re&s;olving to revenge his death, gained him univer&s;al e&s;teem among the people. Being thus apprized of their inclinations, he ea&s;ily induced his army in Syria to proclaim him emperor; and his title was, &s;hortly after, acknowledged by all the kings and potentates in A&s;ia, who &s;ent their amba&s;&s;adors to him as their lawful prince. The plea&s;ure of thus being treated as a monarch, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, retarded his endeavours to &s;e|cure his title. Entirely &s;atisfied with the ho|mage of tho&s;e about him, he neglected the op|portunities of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his rivals, and gave him&s;elf up to fea&s;ting and luxury at Antioch. The conduct of Severus, an African by birth, was very different. Being proclaimed by his army, he began by promi&s;ing to revenge the death of Pertinax, and took upon him his name. He next &s;ecured the fidelity of all the &s;trong places in his province, and then re|&s;olved, with the utmo&s;t expedition, to march, with his whole force, directly to Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Didius, who di&s;regarded the attempts of Niger, was greatly alarmed at
<PB N="392" REF="398">
tho&s;e of Severus. He fir&s;t, with many &s;olicitations, procured the &s;enate to proclaim him a traitor. He then applied him&s;elf to make the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions to oppo&s;e him, in which he found nothing but di&s;appointment. The cohorts that elected him, were enervated by vice and luxury; the people dete&s;ted his cau&s;e; and the cities of Italy had long been di&s;u&s;ed to the arts of war. Some advi&s;ed him to march forward, and meet Severus, as he was cro&s;&s;ing the Alps. Others were for &s;ending the generals upon that expedi|tion. The unfortunate Didius, unequal to the ta&s;k of empire, and quite confounded with the multiplicity of coun&s;els, could take no other re&s;olution, but that of awaiting his rival's coming at Rome. Accordingly, &s;oon after be|ing informed of his approach, he obtained the con&s;ent of the &s;enate to &s;end him amba&s;&s;adors, offering to make him a partner in the empire. But Severus rejected this offer, con&s;cious of his own &s;trength, and of the weakne&s;s of the pro|po&s;er. The &s;enate &s;oon appeared of the &s;ame &s;entiments, and, perceiving the timidity and weakne&s;s of their pre&s;ent ma&s;ter, began to aban|don him. They now began to alledge, That he who could not defend the empire, was un|worthy to govern it. Didius vainly endea|voured to reduce them to their duty, fir&s;t by intreaties, and then by threats; but the&s;e only &s;erved to ha&s;ten his de&s;truction. The &s;enate
<PB N="393" REF="399">
being called together, as was formerly prac|ti&s;ed in the times of the commonwealth, by the con&s;uls, they unanimou&s;ly decreed, That Didius &s;hould be deprived of the empire, and that Se|verus &s;hould be proclaimed in his &s;tead They then commanded Didius to be &s;lain, and &s;ent me&s;&s;engers for this purpo&s;e to the palace, where they found him di&s;armed, and weeping among a few friends, that &s;till adhered to his intere&s;t. When the executioners began to prepare for their fatal errand, he expo&s;tulated with them, demanding what crime he had committed.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS, the twenty-fir&s;t EMPEROR  of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="195" UNIT="A.D."> THE &s;enate having thus di&s;patched Di|dius, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Severus, yielding him obedience, granting him the en&s;igns and the u&s;ual titles of empire, and informing him of the death of Didius. Severus, who was now about forty-&s;even years of age, received them with all proper re&s;pect, and entertaining them honourably, continued his march towards Rome. As he came near the city, his fir&s;t exertion of power was, to have all the Praetorian &s;oldiers, who had lately &s;old the empire, come forth, unarmed, to meet him. The&s;e, though &s;en|&s;ible of their danger, had no other re&s;ource left but compliance; and accordingly came forward, with branches of laurel, as if to wel|come his approach. Severus, however, &s;oon &s;hewed how little capable their pre&s;ent &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion was, to atone for their pa&s;t offences: after upbraiding them, in a &s;hort &s;peech, with all their crimes, he commanded them to be in|&s;tantly &s;tripped of their military habits, de|prived of the name and honour of &s;oldiers, and
<PB N="395" REF="401">
bani&s;hed an hundred miles from Rome. He then entered the city in a military manner, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the palace, and promi&s;ed the &s;enate to conduct him&s;elf with clemency and ju&s;tice. However, though he united great vi|gour with the mo&s;t refined policy, yet his African cunning was con&s;idered as a particular defect in him. He is celebrated for his wit, learning and prudence; but equally blamed for infidelity and cruelty. In &s;hort, he &s;eemed equally di&s;po&s;ed to the performance of the greate&s;t acts of virtue, and the mo&s;t bloody &s;everities. He began his command, by &s;eizing all the children of &s;uch as had employments or authority in the Ea&s;t, and detained them as pledges for their father's loyalty. He next &s;up|plied the city with corn, and then, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, marched again&s;t Niger, who was &s;till con&s;idered, and honoured, as em|peror of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>One of the chief ob&s;tacles to his march, was, the leaving behind him Clodius Albinus, com|mander of the legions in Britain, whom he by all means endeavoured to &s;ecure in his intere&s;ts. For this end he endeavoured to prevail upon him, by giving him hopes of &s;ucceeding to the empire; in&s;inuating, that he him&s;elf was declin|ing, and his children as yet but infants. To deceive him &s;till further, he wrote in the &s;ame &s;tile to the &s;enate, gave him the title of Cae&s;ar,
<PB N="396" REF="402">
and ordered money to be coined with his image. The&s;e artifices &s;erving to lull Albinus into fal&s;e &s;ecurity, Severus marched again&s;t Niger with all his forces. After &s;ome undeci&s;ive conflicts, the la&s;t great battle that was fought between the&s;e two extraordinary men, was upon the plains of I&s;&s;us, on the very &s;pot where Alexander had formerly conquered Darius. Be&s;ide the two great armies drawn upon the plain, the neigh|bouring mountains were covered with infinite numbers of people, who were merely led by curio&s;ity to become &s;pectators of an engagement that was to determine the empire of the world. The fate of the battle was what we have almo&s;t ever found between European and A&s;iatic troops, of nearly equal numbers. Severus was con|queror; and Niger's head being &s;truck off by &s;ome &s;oldiers of the conquering army, was in|&s;ultingly carried through the camp on the point of a launce.</P>
<P>This victory &s;ecured Severus in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. However, the Parthians, Per|&s;ians, and &s;ome other neighbouring nations, took up arms, under a pretence of vindicating Niger's cau&s;e. The emperor marched again&s;t them in per&s;on, had many engagements with them, and obtained &s;uch &s;ignal victories over them, as enlarged the empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed peace in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="403">
Niger being no more, Severus now turned his views again&s;t Albinus, whom he re&s;olved by every means to de&s;troy. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent &s;ome a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins into Britain, under a pretence of bringing him letters, but in reality to di&s;patch him. Albinus being apprized of their de&s;igns, prevented their attempt by recurring to open force, and proclaiming him&s;elf emperor. Nor was he without a powerful army to &s;upport his preten&s;ions; of which Severus being &s;en&s;ible, bent his whole force to oppo&s;e him. From the ea&s;t he continued his cour&s;e acro&s;s the Streights of Byzantium, into the mo&s;t we&s;tern parts of Europe, without intermi&s;&s;ion. Equally regard|le&s;s of the mo&s;t parching heats, and the mo&s;t rigorous colds, he led his &s;oldiers bareheaded over mountains covered with &s;now. Albinus being informed of his approach, went over to meet him with his forces into Gaul, &s;o that the campaign on both &s;ides was carried on with great vigour. Fortune &s;eemed for a while variable; but at la&s;t a deci&s;ive engagement came on, which was one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate recorded in the Roman &s;tory. It la&s;ted from morning till night, without any &s;eeming advantage on either &s;ide; at length, the troops of Severus began to fly, and he him&s;elf happening to fall from his hor&s;e, the army of Albinus cried out victory. But the engagement was &s;oon renewed with vi|gour by Laetus, one of Severus's commanders,
<PB N="398" REF="404">
who came up with a body of re&s;erve, de&s;igning to de&s;troy both parties, and make him&s;elf emperor. This attempt, though de&s;igned again&s;t both, turned out entirely to the advantage of Severus. He, therefore, again charged with &s;uch fury and exactne&s;s, that he &s;oon plucked the victory from tho&s;e who but a &s;hort time before &s;eemed conquerors; and pur&s;uing them into the city of Lyons, took Albinus pri&s;oner, and cut off his head; treating his dead body with in&s;ults that could only flow from a mean and revengeful temper. All the &s;enators who were &s;lain in bat|tle, he ordered to be quartered; and &s;uch as were taken alive, were immediately executed.</P>
<P>Having thus, by means of his army, &s;ecured him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, upon his re|turn to Rome, he loaded his &s;oldiers with re|wards and honours, giving them &s;uch privileges as &s;trengthened his own power, while they de|&s;troyed that of the &s;tate. For the &s;oldiers, who had hitherto &s;hewed the &s;tronge&s;t inclinations to an abu&s;e of power, were now made arbiters of the fate of emperors; and we &s;hall hencefor|ward behold them &s;etting them up, and de|throning them, at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ecure of his army, he re&s;olved to give way to his natural turn for conque&s;t, and to oppo&s;e his arms again&s;t the Parthians, who were then invading the frontiers of the empire. Having, therefore, previou&s;ly given the govern|ment of dome&s;tic policy to one Plautian, a parti|cular
<PB N="399" REF="405">
favourite of his, to who&s;e daughter he mar|ried his &s;on Caracalla, he &s;et out for the ea&s;t, and pro&s;ecuted the war with his u&s;ual expedition and &s;ucce&s;s. He forced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the king of Armenia, de&s;troyed &s;everal cities in Arabia Fe|lix, landed on the Parthian coa&s;ts, took and plundered the famous city Cte&s;iphon, marched back through Pale&s;tine and Egypt, and at length returned to Rome in triumph.</P>
<P>During this interval, Plautian, who was left to direct the affairs of Rome, began to think of a&s;piring to the empire him&s;elf. He had before been remarkably cruel to the Chri&s;tians, and now he re&s;olved to encrea&s;e the number of his crimes by ingratitude and trea&s;on. Upon the empe|ror's return, he employed a tribune of the Praetorian cohorts, of which he was the com|mander, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; as likewi&s;e his &s;on, Caracalla. The tribune &s;eemed chearfully to undertake this dangerous office; but in&s;tead of going through with it, informed Severus of his favourite's treachery. He at fir&s;t received it as an improbable &s;tory, and as the artifice of &s;ome one who envied his favourite's fortune. However, he was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to permit the tribune to conduct Plautian to the empe|ror's apartments. With this intent, the tribune went and amu&s;ed him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his &s;on, de&s;iring him, if he thought it fit to &s;ee them dead, to
<PB N="400" REF="406">
come with him to the palace. As Plautian ar|dently de&s;ired their deaths, he readily gave credit to this relation, and following the tri|bune, he was conducted, at midnight, into the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the palace. But what mu&s;t have been his di&s;appointment, when, in&s;tead of finding the emperor lying dead, as he expected, he beheld the room lighted up with torches, and Severus, &s;urrounded by his friends, prepared in array to receive him. Being a&s;ked by the emperor, with a &s;tern countenance, what had brought him there, at that un&s;ea&s;onable time; he was, at fir&s;t, ut|terly confounded; wherefore, not knowing what excu&s;e to make, he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed the whole, intreating forgivene&s;s for what he had intended. The emperor &s;eemed, in the begin|ning, inclined to pardon; but Caracalla, his &s;on, who, from the earlie&s;t age, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty, &s;purned him away in the mid&s;t of his &s;upplications, and, with his &s;word, ran him through the body.</P>
<P>Severus having e&s;caped this danger, &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in vi&s;iting &s;ome cities in Italy, permitting none of his officers to &s;ell places of tru&s;t or dignity, and di&s;tributing ju&s;tice with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality. He took &s;uch an exact order in managing his exchequer, that, notwith&s;tanding his great expences, he left more money behind him than any of his
<PB N="401" REF="407">
predece&s;&s;ors. His armies al&s;o were kept upon the &s;ame re&s;pectable footing, &s;o that he feared no inva&s;ion. Being equally attentive to the pre&s;ervation of all parts of the empire, he re|&s;olved to make his la&s;t expedition into Britain, where the Romans were in danger of being de|&s;troyed, or compelled to fly the province. Wherefore, after appointing his two &s;ons, Cara|calla and Geta, joint &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the empire, and taking them with him, he landed in Bri|tain, to the great terror of &s;uch as had drawn down his re&s;entment. Upon his progre&s;s into the country, he left his &s;on Geta in the &s;outh|ern part of the province, which had continued in obedience, and marched, with his &s;on Cara|calla, again&s;t the Caledonians. In this expe|dition, his army &s;uffered prodigious hard&s;hips in pur&s;uing the enemy; they were obliged to hew their way through intricate fore&s;ts, to drain exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, and form bridges over rapid rivers; &s;o that he lo&s;t fifty thou&s;and men by fatigue and &s;ickne&s;s. However, he &s;upported all the&s;e inconveniencies with unrelenting bra|very; and pro&s;ecuted his &s;ucce&s;&s;es with &s;uch vigour, that he compelled the enemy to beg for peace; which they obtained, not without the &s;urrender of a con&s;iderable part of their coun|try, together with all their arms and military preparations. Thus giving peace to Britain, for its better &s;ecurity, he built that famous wall,
<PB N="402" REF="408">
which &s;till goes by his name, extending from Solway Frith, on the we&s;t, to the German ocean, on the ea&s;t. It was eight feet broad, and twelve feet high, planted with towers, at a mile's di&s;tance from each other, and communicating by pipes of bra&s;s in the wall, which conveyed in&s;tructions from one garri&s;on to another with incredible di&s;patch. Severus having thus puni&s;hed his enemies, retired to York; where, partly thro' age and fatigue, and partly through grief for the irreclaimable life of Caracalla, he found him&s;elf daily declining. To add to the di&s;tre&s;s of his &s;ituation, he was informed, that the &s;ol|diers had revolted, and declared his &s;on em|peror. In this exigence, he &s;eemed once more to recall his natural vigour; he got him&s;elf immediately into his litter, and commanded the new emperor, with the tribunes and centuri|ons, to be brought before him. Though all were willing to court the favour of the young emperor, &s;uch was the authority of Severus, that none dared to di&s;obey. They appeared before him confounded and trembling, and implored pardon upon their knees. Upon which, putting his hand to his head, he cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Know, that it is the head that governs, and not the feet."</Q> However, &s;oon per|ceiving his di&s;order to increa&s;e, and knowing that he could not outlive it, he could not help ob&s;erving in his agony, That though he had
<PB N="403" REF="409">
been all that a man could be, it was of no &s;er|vice to him at that painful hour. Then order|ing his urn to be brought, wherein his a&s;hes were to be inclo&s;ed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Little urn," &s;aid he, "thou &s;halt now contain what the world could not contain."</Q> Then addre&s;&s;ing his friends that &s;tood near him,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I took the empire upon me," &s;aid he, "I found it declining, and exhau&s;ted: I now leave it &s;trong and la&s;ting to my &s;ons, if they prove virtuous; but feeble and de&s;perate, if otherwi&s;e."</Q> His pains now increa&s;ing, e&s;pecially in his feet, he called for poi&s;on; which being refu&s;ed him, he loaded his &s;tomach with food, which not being able to dige&s;t, it &s;oon brought him to his end, in the &s;ixty-&s;ixth year of his age, after an active, though cruel, reign, of about eighteen years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. CARACALLA and GETA, the twenty-&s;econd EMPE|RORS of ROME.</HEAD>
<P>CARACALLA and GETA being acknow|ledged as emperors by the army, began to &s;hew a mutual hatred to each other, even before their arrival at Rome. Their only agreement was, in re&s;olving to deify Severus, their father;
<PB N="404" REF="410">
but &s;oon after, each &s;ought to attach the &s;enate and army to his own particular intere&s;t. They were of very oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions: Caracalla was fierce and cruel to an extreme degree; Geta was mild and merciful; &s;o that the city &s;oon found the dangerous effects of being go|verned by two princes of equal power and contrary inclinations.</P>
<P>But this oppo&s;ition was of no long continu|ance; for Caracalla, being re&s;olved to govern alone, furiou&s;ly entered Geta's apartment and, followed by ruffians, &s;lew him in his mother's arms. Having committed this dete&s;table mur|der, he i&s;&s;ued, with great ha&s;te, from the pa|lace, crying out, That his brother would have &s;lain him; and that he was obliged, in &s;elf|defence, to retaliate the intended injury. He then took refuge among the Praetorian cohorts, and, in a pathetic tone, began to implore their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;till making the &s;ame excu&s;e for his conduct. To this he added a much more pre|vailing argument, promi&s;ing to be&s;tow upon them, the large&s;&s;es u&s;ually given upon the election of new emperors, and di&s;tributing among them almo&s;t all the trea&s;ures which had been ama&s;&s;ed by his father. By &s;uch per&s;ua|&s;ives, the &s;oldiers did not he&s;itate to proclaim him &s;ole emperor, and to &s;tigmatize the memory of his brother Geta as a traitor, and an enemy to the commonwealth. The &s;enators were,
<PB N="405" REF="411">
&s;oon after, induced, either through favour or fear, to approve what had been done by the army; Caracalla began to reign alone, wept for the death of his brother, whom he had &s;lain; and, to carry his hypocri&s;y to the utmo&s;t extreme, ordered him to be adored as a god.</P>
<P>Being now emperor, he went on to mark his cour&s;e with blood. Whatever was done by Do|mitian, or Nero, fell &s;hort of this mon&s;ter's barbarities. Laetus, who fir&s;t advi&s;ed him to murder his brother, was the fir&s;t who fell a &s;a|crifice to his jealou&s;y. His own wife, Plautina, followed. Papinian, the renowned civilian, was beheaded, for refu&s;ing to write in vin|dication of his cruelty; an&s;wering the em|peror's reque&s;t, by ob&s;erving, That it was much ea&s;ier to commit a parricide, than to de|fend it. He commanded all governors to be &s;lain, that his brother had appointed, and de|&s;troyed not le&s;s than two thou&s;and per&s;ons that had adhered to his party. Whole nights were &s;pent in the execution of his bloody decrees; and the dead bodies of people, of all ranks, were carried out of the city in carts, where they were burnt in heaps, without any of the cere|monies of a funeral. Upon a certain occa&s;ion, he ordered his &s;oldiers to &s;et upon a crowded audience in the theatre, only for di&s;counte|nancing a charioteer, whom he happened to &s;a|vour. Perceiving him&s;elf hated by the people, he publicly &s;aid, That he could in&s;ure his own
<PB N="406" REF="412">
&s;afety, though not their love; &s;o that he nei|ther valued their reproaches, nor feared their hatred.</P>
<P>This &s;afety which he &s;o much built upon, was placed in the protection of his &s;oldiers. He had exhau&s;ted the trea&s;ury, drained the pro|vinces, and committed a thou&s;and acts of rapa|city, merely to keep them &s;tedfa&s;t in his in|tere&s;ts; and being di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t him&s;elf with them particularly, he re&s;olved to lead them upon a vi&s;it through all the provinces of the empire. He fir&s;t went into Germany, where, to oblige the natives, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of their country. From thence, he tra|velled into Macedonia, where he pretended to be a great admirer of Alexander the Great; and, among other extravagancies, cau&s;ed a &s;tatue of that monarch to be made with two faces; one of which re&s;embled Alexander, and the other him&s;elf. He was &s;o corrupted by flattery, that he called him&s;elf Alexander; walked as he was told that monarch had walked, and, like him, bent his head to one &s;houlder. Shortly after, arriving at Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and the ruins of Troy, as he was viewing the tomb of Achilles, he took it into his head to re&s;emble that hero: and one of his freedmen happening to die at that time, he u&s;ed the &s;ame ceremonies that were per|formed at the tomb of Patroclus. Pa&s;&s;ing from thence into Egypt, he cut off numbers at once,
<PB N="407" REF="413">
in the amphitheatre at Alexandria, only for having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome je&s;ts upon his per&s;on and vices. The &s;laughter was &s;o great, that the &s;treams of blood, flowing down, di&s;coloured the mouth of the river Nile.</P>
<P>Going from thence into Syria, he invited Artabanus, king of Parthia, to a conference, de&s;iring his daughter in marriage, and pro|mi&s;ing him the mo&s;t honourable protection. In con&s;equence of this, that king met him on a &s;pacious plain, unarmed, and only attended with a va&s;t concour&s;e of his nobles. This was what Caracalla de&s;ired. Regardle&s;s of his pro|mi&s;e, or the law of nations, he in&s;tantly &s;ur|rounded him, with armed troops, let in wild bea&s;ts among his attendants, and made a mo&s;t terrible &s;laughter among them, Artabanus him|&s;elf e&s;caping with the utmo&s;t difficulty. For this vile treachery, he obtained from the &s;enate the &s;urname of Parthicus.</P>
<P>Upon his return towards Rome, it would &s;eem as if his vices were inexhau&s;tible; for, having been guilty of parricide, he now re|&s;olved to marry the mother of Geta, whom he had &s;lain. It happened that one day, &s;eeing her drop her veil, which di&s;clo&s;ed her naked bo&s;om, which was extremely beautiful, he told her, that he would po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e charms he be|held, if it were lawful. To this unnatural re|que&s;t, &s;he he&s;itated not to an&s;wer, That he
<PB N="408" REF="414">
might enjoy all things, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all. Whereupon, &s;etting a&s;ide all duty and re&s;pect for his decea&s;ed father, he celebrated his nup|tials with her in public, totally di&s;regarding the cen&s;ures and the &s;arca&s;ms of mankind.</P>
<P>However, though he di&s;regarded &s;hame, he was not in&s;en&s;ible to fear. He was ever un|ea&s;y, in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being univer&s;ally hated; and was continually con&s;ulting a&s;trolo|gers concerning what death he &s;hould die. Among others, he &s;ent one of his confidants, named Maternianus, with orders to con&s;ult all the a&s;trologers in the city concerning his end. Maternianus con&s;idered this as a proper time to get rid of Macrinus, the emperor's princi|pal commander in Me&s;&s;opotamia, a man who was daily &s;upplanting him in his ma&s;ter's fa|vour. He, therefore, informed him by letter, as if from the a&s;trologers, that Macrinus had a de&s;ign again&s;t his life; and they con&s;e|quently advi&s;ed him to put the con&s;pirator to death. This letter was &s;ent &s;ealed, and made up, among&s;t many others, to be conveyed with the greater &s;ecrecy, and delivered to the em|peror, as he was preparing for a chariot race. However, as it never was his cu&s;tom to inter|rupt his plea&s;ures for his bu&s;ine&s;s, he gave the pacquet to Macrinus to read over, and to in|form him of the contents, when more at lei&s;ure. In peru&s;ing the&s;e letters, when Macrinus came
<PB N="409" REF="415">
to that, which regarded him&s;elf, he was unable to contain his &s;urprize and terror. His fir&s;t care was, to re&s;erve the letter in que&s;tion to him&s;elf, and to acquaint the emperor only with the &s;ub&s;tance of the re&s;t. He then &s;et about the mo&s;t probable means of compa&s;&s;ing his death, by which alone he could expect any &s;afety. At length he determined to apply to one Martial, a man of great &s;trength, and a centurion of the guards, who hated the emperor from various motives, particularly for the death of a brother, whom Caracalla had or|dered to be &s;lain. Him, therefore, Macrinus, exhorted to revenge his brother's death, by killing the tyrant, which he might ea&s;ily ef|fect, as being always &s;o near his per&s;on. Mar|tial readily undertook the dangerous ta&s;k, being willing to meet death him&s;elf, &s;o he might obtain his de&s;ire of &s;eeing the tyrant ex|pire before him. Accordingly, as the emperor was riding out one day, near a little city called Carrae, he happened to withdraw him&s;elf pri|vately, upon a natural occa&s;ion, with only one page to hold his hor&s;e. This was the opportu|nity Martial had &s;o long and ardently de&s;ired; wherefore, running to him ha&s;tily, as if he had been called, he &s;tabbed the emperor in the back, &s;o that he died immediately. Having performed this hardy attempt, Martial, unconcernedly, returned to his troop; but retiring, by in&s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="410" REF="416">
degrees, he endeavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf by flight. But his companions &s;oon mi&s;&s;ing him, and the page giving information of what had been done, he was pur&s;ued by the German hor&s;e, and cut in pieces.</P>
<P>During the reign of this execrable tyrant, which continued &s;ix years, the empire was every day declining; the &s;oldiers were entirely ma&s;ters of every election; and as there were various armies in different parts, &s;o there were as many intere&s;ts all oppo&s;ite to each other. Caracalla, by &s;atisfying their mo&s;t unrea&s;onable appetites, de&s;troyed all di&s;cipline among them, and all &s;ubordination in the &s;tate. However, the con&s;titution of Rome at pre&s;ent pretty much re&s;embled that of ancient Rome; kings or governors were cho&s;en at both times by the people; but in ancient Rome, tho&s;e people were but occa&s;ionally &s;oldiers; in the latter empire, they were &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

The &s;enate confirmed their choice &s;hortly after; and likewi&s;e that of his &s;on Diadumenus, whom he took as a partner in the empire. Macrinus was fifty-three years old when he entered upon the government of the empire. He was of ob&s;cure parentage; &s;ome &s;ay, by birth a Moor, who by the mere rotation of office, being made fir&s;t praefect of the Praetorian bands, was now, by trea&s;on and accident, called to fill the throne. We are told but little of this emperor, except his engaging in a bloody, though undecided battle, with Artabanus, king of Parthia, who came to take vengeance for the injury he had &s;u&s;tained in the late reign; however, this mo|narch finding his real enemy dead, was content to make peace, and returned into Parthia.

It was this rigorous di&s;cipline, together with the artifices of Mo&s;a, grand-mother to Heliogabalus, the na|tural &s;on of Caracalla, that cau&s;ed the emperor's ruin. Heliogabalus was prie&s;t of a temple dedi|cated to the Sun, in Eme&s;a, a city of Phaenicia, and though but fourteen years old, was greatly loved by the army, for the beauty of his per&s;on, and the memory of his father, whom they &s;till con&s;idered as their greate&s;t benefactor. This was &s;oon perceived by the grand-mother, who being very rich in gold and jewels, gave liberal pre&s;ents among them, while they frequently re|paired to her temple, both from the garri&s;on in the city, and the camp of Macrinus. This in|tercour&s;e growing every day more frequent, and the &s;oldiers being di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;everities of their pre&s;ent emperor, Macrinus began to think of placing Heliogabalus in his &s;tead. Accordingly, &s;ending for him to their camp, he was immediately proclaimed; and &s;uch were the hopes of his virtues, that all men began to affect his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Macrinus, who at this time was pur&s;uing his plea&s;ures at Antioch, gave but little attention to

the fir&s;t report, only &s;ending his lieutenant Ju|lian, with &s;ome legions, to quell the in&s;urrection. However, the&s;e, like the re&s;t, &s;oon declared for Heliogabalus, and &s;lew their general. It was then that Macrinus found he had treated the rebellion too &s;lightly; he therefore re&s;olved, with his &s;on, to march directly again&s;t the &s;e|ditious legions, and force them to their duty. Both parties met on the confines of Syria; the battle was for &s;ome time furious and ob&s;tinate; but at la&s;t, Macrinus was overthrown, and ob|liged to &s;eek &s;afety by flight. His principal aim was to get to Rome, where he knew his pre&s;ence was de&s;ired; wherefore, he travelled through the provinces of A&s;ia Minor, with the utmo&s;t expedition and privacy, but unfortu|nately fell &s;ick at the city of Chalcedon. There tho&s;e who were &s;ent in pur&s;uit, overtook, and put him to death, together with his &s;on Diadu|menus, after a &s;hort reign of one year and two months.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. HELIOGABALUS, the twenty-fourth EMPEROR  of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="971" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="218" UNIT="A.D."> THE &s;enate and citizens of Rome being ob|liged to &s;ubmit to the appointment of the army, as u&s;ual, Heliogabalus a&s;cended the throne, at the age of fourteen. One at &s;o early an age, inve&s;ted with unlimited power, and &s;urrounded with flatterers, could be expected to act only as they thought proper to direct. This young emperor was entirely led by them; and being &s;en&s;ible that it was in his power to indulge all his appetites, he &s;tudied only their gratification. As he is de&s;cribed by hi&s;torians, he appears, a mon&s;ter of &s;en&s;uality. But little better could be expected from an emperor at fourteen, let loo&s;e from every re&s;traint. His &s;hort life, there|fore, is but a ti&s;&s;ue of effeminacy, lu&s;t, and ex|travagance. He married, in the &s;mall &s;pace of four years, &s;ix wives, and divorced them all. This was not the wor&s;t; he took upon him&s;elf the quality of a woman, and married one of his officers; after that, he took for hu&s;band, one Hierocles, a &s;lave, whom he &s;uffered to beat him &s;everely when he was guilty of any exce&s;s; all
<PB N="415" REF="421">
which he &s;uffered with great patience, &s;aying, that a wife was obliged to &s;ubmit to her hu&s;band. He built a temple to the &s;un, and, willing that his god &s;hould have a wife as well as him&s;elf, he married him to Pallas, and, &s;hortly after, to the moon. His palace was a place of ren|dezvous for all the pro&s;titutes of Rome, whom he frequently met naked, calling them his fel|low-&s;oldiers, and companions in the field. He was &s;o fond of the &s;ex, that he carried his mo|ther with him to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and demanded that &s;he &s;hould always be pre&s;ent when matters of importance were debated. He even went &s;o far as to build a &s;enate-hou&s;e for women, with &s;uitable orders, habits and di&s;tinctions, of which his mother was made pre&s;ident. They met &s;e|veral times; all their debates turning upon the fa&s;hions of the day, and the different formalities to be u&s;ed at giving and receiving vi&s;its. To the&s;e follies he added, great cruelty, and bound|le&s;s prodigality; &s;o that he was heard to &s;ay, that &s;uch di&s;hes as were cheaply obtained, were &s;carce worth eating. His &s;uppers, therefore, generally co&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and crowns, and often &s;ixty thou&s;and. He always dre&s;t in cloth of gold and purple, enriched with precious &s;tones, and yet never wore the &s;ame habit twice. His palace, his chambers, and his beds, were all fur|ni&s;hed of the riche&s;t &s;tuffs, covered with gold and jewels. Whenever he took hor&s;e, all the
<PB N="416" REF="422">
way between his apartment and the place of mounting, was covered with gold and &s;ilver du&s;t &s;trewn at his approach. In &s;hort, all his government, actions, dre&s;s, and fur|niture, te&s;tified the extravagant folly of a vicious boy. Thus he was &s;een at one time driving elephants yoaked to his chariot; at another, ma&s;tiff dogs; at one time he was drawn by lions; at another, by four naked women. He was &s;o extravagantly whim&s;ical, that he cau&s;ed a collection to be made of ten thou&s;and pound weight of &s;piders, to be a te&s;timony of the magnitude of the city. He would invite gue&s;ts to &s;upper in the &s;ame &s;pirit of ab&s;urdity; thus he gave a fea&s;t to eight old men, eight bald men, eight blind of one eye, eight lame with the gout, eight deaf men, eight blacks, and eight &s;o fat that they could &s;carce &s;it at the &s;ame ta|ble. The&s;e were the tricks of a child, and might pa&s;s for harmle&s;s follies, had he not united malevolence with every entertainment. He was often &s;een to &s;mother his gue&s;ts in rooms filled with ro&s;es; and terrify them by letting loo&s;e wild bea&s;ts among them, previou&s;ly de|prived of their teeth and claws. It is even &s;aid, he &s;trove to foretel what was to happen, by in&s;pecting the entrails of young men &s;acrificed; and that he cho&s;e the mo&s;t beautiful youths throughout Italy, to be &s;lain for that horrid purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="423">
The&s;e exce&s;&s;es were &s;oon perceived by his grand-mother Mae&s;a, who&s;e intrigues had fir&s;t rai&s;ed him to the throne, &s;o that &s;he thought to le&s;&s;en his power by dividing it. For this pur|po&s;e, under a pretence of freeing him from the cares of public bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he per&s;uaded him to adopt his cou&s;in-german, Alexander, as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and likewi&s;e to make him his partner in the con&s;ul&s;hip. Heliogabalus, having thus rai&s;ed his cou&s;in, had &s;carce given him his power, when he wi&s;hed again to take it away; but the virtues of this young prince had &s;o greatly endeared the people and the army to him, that the attempt had like to have been fa|tal to the tyrant him&s;elf. The Praetorian &s;ol|diers mutinying, attempted to kill him, as he was walking in his gardens, but he e&s;caped, by hiding him&s;elf from their fury. However, upon returning to their camp, they continued the &s;edition, requiring that the emperor &s;hould remove &s;uch per&s;ons from about him, as oppre&s;t the &s;ubject, and contributed to contaminate him. They required al&s;o the being permitted to guard the young prince them&s;elves; and that none of the emperor's favourites or familiars &s;hould ever be permitted to conver&s;e with him. Heliogabalus was reluctantly obliged to comply; and, con|&s;cious of the danger he was in, made prepa|rations for death, when it &s;hould arrive, in a manner truly whim&s;ical and peculiar. He built
<PB N="418" REF="424">
a lofty tower, with &s;teps of gold and pearl, from whence to throw him&s;elf headlong in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. He al&s;o prepared cords of pur|ple &s;ilk and gold to &s;trangle him&s;elf with; he provided golden &s;words and daggers to &s;tab him&s;elf with; and poi&s;on to be kept in boxes of emerald, in order to obtain what death he cho&s;e be&s;t. Thus, fearing all things, but particularly &s;u&s;picious of the de&s;igns of the &s;enate, he ba|ni&s;hed them all out of the city; he next at|tempted to poi&s;on Alexander, and &s;pread a re|port of his death; but perceiving the &s;oldiers be|gin to mutiny, he immediately took him in his chariot to the camp, where he only experienced a fre&s;h mortification, by finding all the accla|mations of the army directed only to his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. This not a little rai&s;ed his indignation, and excited his de&s;ire of revenge. He returned towards the city, threatening the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hments again&s;t tho&s;e who had di&s;plea&s;ed him, and meditating fre&s;h cruelties. However, the &s;oldiers were unwilling to give him time to put his de&s;igns in execution; they followed him directly to his palace, pur&s;ued him from apart|ment to apartment, till at la&s;t he was found con|cealed in a privy; a &s;ituation very different from that in which he expected to die. Having dragged him from thence through the &s;treets, with the mo&s;t bitter invectives, and having di&s;patched him, they attempted once more to &s;queeze his
<PB N="419" REF="425">
pampered body into a privy; but not ea&s;ily affecting this, they threw it into the Tyber, with heavy weights, that none might afterwards find or give it burial. This was the mi&s;erable and ignominious death of Heliogabalus, in the eighteenth year of his age, after a dete&s;table reign of four years. His mother al&s;o was &s;lain at the &s;ame time by the &s;oldiers; as al&s;o many of the opprobious a&s;&s;ociates of his criminal plea|&s;ures; having &s;takes drove up their bodies, that their deaths might be conformable to their lives.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. ALEXANDER, the Twenty-fifth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="975" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="222" UNIT="A.D."> ALEXANDER being, without oppo&s;ition,  declared emperor, the &s;enate, in their u&s;ual me|thod  of adulation, were for conferring new ti|tles upon him; but he mode&s;tly declined them all, alledging, that titles were only then honour|able when given to virtue, not to &s;tation. This out&s;et was an happy omen of his future virtues; and few princes in hi&s;tory have been more com|mended by his cotemporaries, or indeed more de&s;erved commendation. To the mo&s;t rigid ju&s;tice he added the greate&s;t humanity. He loved the good, and was a &s;evere reprover of
<PB N="420" REF="426">
the lewd and infamous. His accompli&s;hments were equal to his virtues. He was an excellent mathematician, geometrician, and mu&s;ician; he was equally &s;kilful in painting and &s;culpture; and in poetry, few of his time could equal him. In &s;hort, &s;uch were his talents, and &s;uch the &s;o|lidity of his judgment, that, though but &s;ixteen years of age, he was con&s;idered as a wi&s;e old man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of his reign was &s;pent in a re|formation of the abu&s;es of his predece&s;&s;or. He re&s;tored the &s;enators to their rank; nothing be|ing undertaken without the mo&s;t &s;age advi&s;ers, and mo&s;t mature deliberation. Among the number of his advi&s;ers, was his mother Mam|maea, a woman eminent for her virtues and ac|compli&s;hments, and who made u&s;e of her power as well to &s;ecure her &s;on the affections of his &s;ubjects, as to procure them the mo&s;t ju&s;t admi|ni&s;tration. Among his mini&s;ters of &s;tate, the principal were, Ulpian, the celebrated lawyer; and Sabinus, the &s;enator, who was called the Cato of his time. Merit only was the pa&s;&s;port to his protection; he would never permit offices or places to be purcha&s;ed for money; it being a frequent maxim with him, that he who bought an office, mu&s;t con&s;equently be a &s;eller of ju&s;tice. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I cannot," he would &s;ay, "bear to &s;ee merchants in authority; if I fir&s;t allow them to be &s;uch, I cannot after condemn their
<PB N="421" REF="427">
conduct: for how could I puni&s;h the per&s;on who bought, when I permitted him to be a buyer?"</Q> He was, therefore, a rigid puni&s;her of &s;uch magi&s;trates as took bribes, &s;aying, That it was not enough to deprive &s;uch of their places, for their tru&s;ts being great, their lives, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, ought to pay for a breach of them. On the contrary, he thought he could never &s;ufficiently reward &s;uch as had been re|markable for their ju&s;tice and integrity, keep|ing a regi&s;ter of their names, and &s;ome|times a&s;king &s;uch of them as appeared mode&s;t and unwilling to approach him, why they were &s;o backward in demanding their reward; and why they &s;uffered him to be in their debt. In &s;hort, he was ob&s;erved every day to have done &s;ome good; in which he had the advantage of Titus, by having a longer reign. His clemency extended even to the Chri&s;tians, who had been puni&s;hed in the former reigns with unrelenting barbarity. Upon a conte&s;t between them and a company of cooks and vintners, about a piece of public ground, which the one claimed as a place for public wor&s;hip, and the other for ex|erci&s;ing their re&s;pective trades, he decided the point by his re&s;cript, in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is better that God be wor&s;hipped there in any manner, than that the place &s;hould be put to u&s;es of drunkenne&s;s or debauchery."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="428">
His abilities in war, were not inferior to his a&s;&s;iduity in peace. The empire, which, from the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and debauchery of the preceding reigns, now began to be attacked on every &s;ide, wanted a per&s;on of vigour and conduct to defend it. Alexander faced the enemy where|ever the inva&s;ion was mo&s;t formidable, and, for a &s;hort time, deferred its ruin. His fir&s;t expedion, in the tenth year of his reign, was again&s;t the Parthians and Per&s;ians, whom he oppo&s;ed with a powerful army. His regularity and di&s;cipline were things almo&s;t unknown among the debauched &s;oldiery; his camp re|&s;embled a well regulated city, his &s;oldiers were well cloathed and armed, and his cavalry pro|perly mounted; &s;o that his army now gave an idea of Rome in its &s;plendour. His manner of living was like that of the meane&s;t centinel; whenever he dined, or &s;upped, he &s;ate with his tent open, that all men might be witne&s;&s;es of the frugality of his table. Succe&s;s again&s;t the enemy was the reward of &s;o much military virtue. The Per&s;ians were routed in a deci&s;ive engagement, with great &s;laughter; the cities of Cte&s;iphon and Babylon were once more taken, and the Roman empire re&s;tored to its former limits. Upon his return to Antioch, his mo|ther, Mammaea, &s;ent for the famous Origen, to be in&s;tructed by him in the principles of chri&s;tianity; and after di&s;cour&s;ing with him for
<PB N="423" REF="429">
&s;ome time upon the &s;ubject, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, with a proper &s;afeguard, to his native city of Alex|andria. About the &s;ame time that Alexander was victorious in the Ea&s;t, Furius Cel&s;us, his general, obtained a &s;ignal victory over the Mauritanians, in Africa; Varius Macrinus was &s;ucce&s;sful in Germany, and Junius Palmatus returned with conque&s;t from Armenia. How|ever, the number of the&s;e victories only ha&s;tened the decline of the empire, which was wa&s;ted by the exertion of its own &s;trength, and was now becoming little more than a &s;plendid ruin.</P>
<P>About the thirteenth year of his reign, the Upper Germans, and other northern nations, began to pour down immen&s;e &s;warms of people upon the more &s;outhern parts of the empire. They pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine and the Danube with &s;uch fury, that all Italy was thrown into the mo&s;t extreme con&s;ternation. The emperor, ever ready to expo&s;e his per&s;on, for the &s;afety of his people, made what levies he could, and went in per&s;on to &s;tem the torrent, which he &s;peedily effected. It was in the cour&s;e of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es again&s;t the enemy, that he was cut off by a mutiny among his own &s;oldiers. The legions encamped about Moguntia, having been abo|minably corrupted, during the reign of Helio|gabalus, and trained up in all kinds of rapine and di&s;obedience, required the mo&s;t &s;trict com|mand. Alexander could neither endure their
<PB N="424" REF="430">
tumultuary obedience, nor they his regular di&s;cipline. His own faults, and tho&s;e of his mother Mammaea, were objected again&s;t him. They openly exclaimed, That they were go|verned by an avaricious woman, and a mean|&s;pirited boy, and re&s;olved upon electing an emperor, capable of ruling alone. In this general revolt, Maximin, an old and experi|enced commander, held frequent conferences with the &s;oldiers, and enflamed the &s;edition. At length, being determined to di&s;patch their pre&s;ent emperor, they &s;ent an executioner into his tent who immediately &s;truck off his head; and, &s;hortly after, that of his mother. He died in the twenty-ninth year of his age, after a pro&s;perous reign of thirteen years and nine days; his death proving, that no virtue or ju&s;tice can guard us again&s;t the misfortunes of this life; and that good men are to expect their reward in a place of more equitable di&s;tri|bution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. MAXIMIN, the Twenty-&s;ixth EMPEROR of Rome. </HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="988" UNIT="U. C."><MILESTONE N="235" UNIT="A.D."> THE tumults occa&s;ioned by the death of  Alexander, being appea&s;ed, Maximin, who had been the chief promoter of the &s;edition, was cho&s;en emperor. This extraordinary man, who&s;e character de&s;erves particular attention, was born of very ob&s;cure parentage, being the &s;on of a poor herd&s;man of Thrace. In the be|ginning, he followed his father's humble pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and only exerci&s;ed his per&s;onal courage again&s;t the robbers who infe&s;ted that part of the country in which he lived. Soon after, his ambition increa&s;ing, he left his poor employ|ment, and enli&s;ted in the Roman army, where he &s;oon became remarkable for his great &s;trength, di&s;cipline and courage. This gi|gantic man was no le&s;s than eight feet and an half high; he had a body and &s;trength corre|&s;ponding to his &s;ize, being not le&s;s remarkable for the magnitude, than the &s;ymmetry of his per&s;on. His wife's bracelet u&s;ually &s;erved him for a thumb ring; and his &s;trength was &s;o great, that he was able to draw a carriage
<PB N="426" REF="432">
which two oxen could not move. He could &s;trike out an hor&s;e's teeth, with a blow of his fi&s;t; and break its thigh with a kick. His diet was as extraordinary as the re&s;t of his en|dowments: he generally eat forty pounds weight of fle&s;h every day, and drank &s;ix gallons of wine, without committing any debauch in either. With a frame &s;o athletic, he was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mind undaunted in danger, and nei|ther fearing nor regarding any man. The fir&s;t time he was made known to the emperor Seve|rus, was upon his celebrating games on the birth-day of his &s;on Geta. Maximin was then a rude countryman, and reque&s;ted the emperor to be permitted to contend for the prizes which were di&s;tributed to the be&s;t runners, wre&s;tlers and boxers of the army. Severus, un|willing to infringe the military di&s;cipline, would not permit him at fir&s;t to combat, except with &s;laves, again&s;t whom his &s;trength appeared a&s;toni&s;hing. He overcame &s;ixteen in running, one after the other: he then kept up with the emperor on hor&s;eback; and having fatigued him in the cour&s;e, he was oppo&s;ed to &s;even of the mo&s;t active &s;oldiers, and overcame them with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. From that time he was particularly noticed, and taken into the empe|ror's body guard, in which his a&s;&s;iduity and prompt obedience were particularly remark|able. In the reign of Caracalla, he was made
<PB N="427" REF="433">
a centurion, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, in this &s;tation, by his &s;trict attention to the morals and di&s;cipline of tho&s;e he commanded. When made a tribune, he &s;till retained the hardy &s;implicity of his life; eat as the meane&s;t centinel; &s;pent whole days in exerci&s;ing the troops; and would now and then him&s;elf wre&s;tle with eight or ten of the &s;tronge&s;t men in the army, whom he threw with &s;carce any effort. Being thus be|come one of the mo&s;t remarkable men in the empire, both for courage, di&s;cipline and per|&s;onal activity, he gave, &s;hortly after, a very high in&s;tance of his un&s;haken fidelity: for when Macrinus was made emperor, he refu&s;ed to &s;erve under a prince that had betrayed his &s;overeign; and retired to Thrace, his native country, where he followed commerce, and purcha&s;ed &s;ome lands, content with privacy rather than a guilty dependance. Upon the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Heliogabalus to the throne, this bold veteran once more returned to the army, but was, in the very beginning, di&s;gu&s;ted at the ba&s;e effeminacy of the emperor; who, hearing amazing in&s;tances of his &s;trength, a&s;ked him, if he were equally capable in combats of another nature. This lewd demand was &s;o little &s;uit|able to the temper of Maximin, that he in|&s;tantly left the court. Upon the death of Helio|gabalus, he again returned to Rome, and was received with great kindne&s;s by Alexander,
<PB N="428" REF="434">
who particularly recommended him to the &s;e|nate, and made him commander of the fourth legion, which con&s;i&s;ted of new rai&s;ed &s;oldiers. Maximin gladly accepted of this charge, and performed his duty with great exactne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;etting an example of virtue and di&s;ci|pline to all the commanders of the army. Nor was his valour le&s;s apparent again&s;t the Ger|mans, whither he was &s;ent with his legion; &s;o that he was unanimou&s;ly con&s;idered as the bold|e&s;t, brave&s;t, mo&s;t valiant and mo&s;t virtuous &s;ol|dier in the whole empire. He &s;oon, however, for&s;eited all the&s;e ju&s;tly merited titles when he was rai&s;ed to the throne; and, from being the mo&s;t loved commander in the army, he be|came the mo&s;t cruel tyrant upon earth. The change in his di&s;po&s;ition may readily &s;erve to &s;hew how dangerous a thing is power, that could transform a per&s;on with &s;o many rigid virtues into &s;uch a mon&s;ter of iniquity. Yet in fact, his former virtues were all of the &s;evere and rigid kind; which, without any education might very ea&s;ily degenerate into tyranny; &s;o that he might have mi&s;taken his &s;ucceeding cruelty for di&s;cipline, and his &s;everity for ju&s;|tice. However this be, Maximin is con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t mon&s;ters of cruelty that ever di&s;graced power; and, fearful of nothing him&s;elf, he &s;eemed to &s;port with the terrors of all mankind.</P>

Maximin &s;eeing him&s;elf advanced to &s;o high a &s;tation as the empire, began immediately by endeavouring to force obedience from every rank of people, and by vindicating his authority by violence. The &s;enate and people of Rome were the fir&s;t that incurred his re&s;entment. They utterly refu&s;ing to confirm the election of the army, he was the fir&s;t emperor who reigned with|out their concurrence or approbation. However, he &s;eemed regardle&s;s of their oppo&s;ition, pro|ceeding to &s;ecure his election by putting all &s;uch to death as had been rai&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;or. The Chri&s;tians al&s;o having found favours in the former reign, felt the weight of his re&s;ent|ment, and were per&s;ecuted in &s;everal parts of the empire, particularly in tho&s;e where he him|&s;elf re&s;ided. His cruelty likewi&s;e extended to the rich, who&s;e lives and e&s;tates became a fre|quent &s;acrifice to avarice and &s;u&s;picion. But what appears &s;till a more extraordinary in&s;tance of his cruelty, being a&s;hamed of the meanne&s;s of his extraction, he commanded all &s;uch as were be&s;t acquainted with him and his paren|tage to be &s;lain, altho' there were &s;ome among the number, that had relieved him in his low condition.</P>
<P>However, his cruelties did not retard his mi|litary operations, which were carried on with a &s;pirit becoming a better monarch. He overthrew the Germans in &s;everal battles,
<PB N="430" REF="436">
wa&s;ted all their country with fire and &s;word for four hundred miles together, and &s;et a re&s;olu|tion of &s;ubduing all the northern nations as far as the ocean. In the&s;e expeditions, in order to attach the &s;oldiers more firmly to him, he en|crea&s;ed their pay; and in every duty of the camp, he him&s;elf took as much pains as the meane&s;t centinel in his army, &s;hewing incredi|ble courage and a&s;&s;iduity. In every engage|ment, wherever the conflict was hotte&s;t, Maxi|min was always&punc; &s;een fighting there in per&s;on, and de&s;troying all before him: for, being bred a barbarian, he con&s;idered it as his duty to combat as a common &s;oldier, while he com|manded as a general.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his cruelties had &s;o alie|nated the minds of his &s;ubjects, that &s;everal con&s;piracies were &s;ecretly aimed again&s;t him. Magnus, a con&s;ular per&s;on, and &s;ome others, had plotted to break down a wooden bridge, as &s;oon as the emperor had pa&s;t it, and thus to abandon him to the enemy. But this being di&s;covered, gave Maximin an opportunity of indulging his natural &s;everity, upon this pre|text alone, cau&s;ing above four thou&s;and to be &s;lain. Shortly after, &s;ome of Alexander's old &s;oldiers withdrawing them&s;elves from the camp, proclaimed one Quarcianus as emperor, who had been lately di&s;gu&s;ted at Maximin, for be|ing di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from employment. The &s;oldiers,
<PB N="431" REF="437">
in fact, con&s;trained him to accept of the dan|gerous &s;uperiority to which he was expo&s;ed; and &s;hortly after, in the &s;pirit of the times, the per&s;on who had been the promoter of his advancement, murdered him in his bed, and carried his head to Maximin, who received him kindly at fir&s;t, but &s;oon put him to a cruel death, for his complicated guilt of trea&s;on and treachery.</P>
<P>The&s;e partial in&s;urrections were &s;oon after followed by a &s;pirit of general di&s;content throughout all the empire. The provinces of Africa were the fir&s;t that &s;hewed their de|te&s;tation of the tyrant, who&s;e extortions and cruelties among them were become in&s;upport|able. They fir&s;t &s;lew his procurator, and af|terwards con&s;idering how dangerous a crime they had committed, they re&s;olved to throw off all expectations of pardon, and create a new emperor. Gordian was then procon&s;ul of Africa, a per&s;on of great fame for his vir|tues, and greatly reverenced for a blamele&s;s life of near eighty. Him, therefore, they determined to elect, and accordingly the &s;ol|diers and natives a&s;&s;embling together, tumul|tuou&s;ly entered his hou&s;e, re&s;olved to put their de&s;ign in execution. Gordian, who at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed they were come to kill him, being made &s;en&s;ible of their intentions, utterly re|fu&s;ed their offer, alledging his extreme age,
<PB N="432" REF="438">
and Maximin's power. But all his oppo&s;ition was vain; they con&s;trained him to accept of the profferred dignity; and he, with his &s;on Gor|dian, who was forty-&s;ix years of age, were de|clared emperors. Being thus rai&s;ed, contrary to his inclinations, the old man immediately wrote to the &s;enate, declaring that he had un|willingly accepted of the empire, and would only keep his authority till he had freed it from the tyranny of its pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;or. The &s;enate very joyfully confirmed his election, ad|judging Maximin as an enemy and a traitor to the &s;tate. The citizens al&s;o &s;hewed an equal zeal in the cau&s;e; they flew upon &s;uch as were the reputed friends of Maximin, and tore them in pieces; even &s;ome who were innocent, fall|ing a &s;acrifice to the multitude's blind rage. So great an alteration being made in the city again&s;t the intere&s;ts of Maximin, the &s;enate were re&s;olved to drive their oppo&s;ition to the extreme, and accordingly made all nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their &s;ecurity, ordering Maxi|min's governors to be di&s;placed, and com|manding all the provinces to acknowledge Gor|dian for emperor. This order was differently received in different parts, as people were af|fected to one or the other party; in &s;ome pro|vinces the governors were &s;lain; in others, the me&s;&s;engers of the &s;enate; &s;o that all parts of the empire felt the con&s;equences of the civil war.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="439">
In the mean time, when Maximin was in|formed of the&s;e charges again&s;t him, his rage appeared ungovernable. He roared like a &s;avage bea&s;t, and violently &s;truck his head again&s;t the wall, &s;hewing every in&s;tance of ungovernable di|&s;traction. At length, his fury being &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, he called his whole army together; and, in a &s;et &s;peech, exhorted them to revenge his cau&s;e, giving them the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, That they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;tates of all &s;uch as had offended. The &s;oldiers unanimou&s;ly promi&s;ed to be faithful; they received his ha|rangue with their u&s;ual acclamations; and, thus encouraged, he led them towards Rome, breathing nothing but &s;laughter and revenge. However, he found many ob&s;tacles to his im|petuo&s;ity; and, though he de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as di&s;patch, his marches were incommo|dious and &s;low. The tumultuous and di&s;|obedient armies of the empire, were, at pre&s;ent, very different from the legions that were led on by a Sylla, or a Cae&s;ar; they were loaded with baggage, and followed by &s;laves and wo|men, rather re&s;embling an ea&s;tern caravan, than a military batallion. To the&s;e inconve|niencies al&s;o was added the hatred of the cities through which he pa&s;&s;ed, the inhabitants all abandoning their hopes upon his approach, and &s;ecuring their provi&s;ions in proper hiding places. However, in this complication of
<PB N="434" REF="440">
inconveniencies and misfortunes, his affairs be|gan to wear a favourable appearance in Africa; for Capelianus, the governor of Numidia, rai&s;ed a body of troops in his favour, and marched again&s;t Gordian, towards Carthage, where he fought the younger Gordian, &s;lew him, and de&s;troyed his army. His father hear|ing of the death of his &s;on, together with the lo&s;s of the battle, &s;trangled him&s;elf in his own girdle. Capelianus pur&s;uing his victory, en|tered Carthage, where he gave a loo&s;e to pil|lage and &s;laughter, under a pretence of re|venging the cau&s;e of Maximin. The news of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es was &s;oon brought to the em|peror, who now increa&s;ed his diligence, and flattered him&s;elf with a &s;peedy opportunity of revenge. He led on his large army by ha&s;ty journeys into Italy, threatening de&s;truction to all his oppo&s;ers, and ardently wi&s;hing for fre&s;h opportunities of &s;laughter.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the con&s;ternation of the &s;enate upon the news of this defeat. They now &s;aw them&s;elves not only deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Gordian and his &s;on, on whom they greatly relied, but al&s;o oppo&s;ed by two formi|dable tyrants, each commanding a victorious army, directly marching towards Rome, and meditating nothing but vengeance. In this afflicting exigence, they, with great &s;olemnity, met at the temple of Jupiter, and after the mo&s;t
<PB N="435" REF="441">
mature deliberation cho&s;e Pupienus and Bal|binus emperors conjointly. The&s;e were men who had acquired the e&s;teem of the public both in war and peace, having commanded armies and governed provinces with great reputation; and being now appointed to oppo&s;e Maximin, they made what levies they could, both in Rome and the country. With the&s;e, Pupienus marched to &s;top the progre&s;s of the invaders, leaving the city to a fre&s;h and unlooked for calamity. This was occa&s;ioned by two of Maximin's &s;oldiers, who, entering the &s;enate-hou&s;e, were &s;lain by two &s;enators. This quickly gave offence to the body of the Praetorian &s;oldiers, who in|&s;tantly re&s;olved to take revenge, but were op|po&s;ed by the citizens; &s;o that nothing was &s;een throughout Rome, but tumult, &s;laughter and cruelty. In this univer&s;al confu&s;ion the cala|mity was increa&s;ed, by the &s;oldiers &s;etting the city on fire, while the wretched inhabitants were combating each other in the mid&s;t of the flames.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Maximin him&s;elf, in who&s;e favour the&s;e &s;editions were promoted, did not &s;eem to be more fortunate. Upon being in|formed of the new election of emperors, his fury was again renewed, and he pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, entering Italy, expecting to refre&s;h his fatigued and fami&s;hed army in that fertile part of the country. But in this he was entirely
<PB N="436" REF="442">
di&s;appointed; the &s;enate had taken &s;uch care to remove all kinds of &s;u&s;tenance to fortified places, that he &s;till found him&s;elf reduced to his former nece&s;&s;ities, while his army began to murmur for want. To this another di&s;appoint|ment was added &s;hortly after: for approach|ing the city of Aquileia, which he expected to enter without any difficulty, he was a&s;toni&s;hed to find it prepared for the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance, and re&s;olved to hold out a regular &s;iege. This city was well fortified and popu|lous, and the inhabitants greatly aver&s;e to Maximin's government; but what added &s;till more to its &s;trength, it was commanded by two excellent generals, Cri&s;pinus and Menophilus, who had &s;o well furni&s;hed it with men and amu|nition, that Maximin found no &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance, even in inve&s;ting the place. His fir&s;t attempt was, to take the city by &s;torm; but the be|&s;ieged threw down &s;uch quantities of &s;calding pitch and &s;ulphur upon his &s;oldiers, that they were unable to continue the a&s;&s;ault. He then determined upon a blockade; but the inhabi|tants were &s;o re&s;olute, that even the old men and children were &s;een combating upon the walls, while the women cut off their hair, to furni&s;h the &s;oldiers with bow &s;trings. Maximin's rage, at this unexpected oppo&s;ition, was now ungovernable: having no enemy to wreck his re&s;entment upon, he turned it again&s;t his own
<PB N="437" REF="443">
commanders. He put many of his generals to death, as if the city had held out through their neglect or incapacity, while famine made great depredations upon the re&s;t of his army. No|thing now appeared on either &s;ide to terminate the conte&s;t, except the total de&s;truction of either. But a mutiny in Maximin's own army, a while re&s;cued the declining empire from de|&s;truction, and &s;aved the lives of thou&s;ands. The &s;oldiers being long harra&s;&s;ed by famine and fatigue, and hearing of revolts on every &s;ide, re&s;olved to terminate their calamities by the tyrant's death. His great &s;trength, and his being always armed, were, at fir&s;t, the princi|pal motives to deter any from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating him; but at length having made his guards accom|plices in their de&s;ign, they &s;et upon him, while he &s;lept at noon in his tent, and &s;lew both him and his &s;on, whom he had made his partner in the empire, without any oppo&s;ition. Thus died this mo&s;t remarkable man, after an u&s;ur|pation of about three years, and in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age. His a&s;&s;iduity, when in humble &s;tation, and his cruelty, when in power, &s;erve very well to evince, that there are &s;ome men, who&s;e virtues are fitted for ob&s;curity, and others who only &s;hew them&s;elves great, when placed in an exalted &s;tation.</P>

This prince was but &s;ixteen years old when he began his reign, but his virtues &s;eemed to compen&s;ate for his want of experience. His principal aims were, to unite the oppo&s;ing members of the govern|ment,
<PB N="440" REF="446">
and to reconcile the &s;oldiers and citizens to each other. His learning is &s;aid to have been equal to his virtues; and we are a&s;&s;ured that he had &s;ixty-two thou&s;and books in his library.

<P>The four fir&s;t years of this emperor's reign, were attended with the utmo&s;t pro&s;perity; but in the fifth, he was alarmed with accounts from the ea&s;t, that Sapor, king of Per&s;ia, had furi|ou&s;ly invaded the confines of the Roman em|pire, and having taken Antioch, had pillaged Syria, and all the adjacent provinces. Be&s;ides the Per&s;ians, the Goths al&s;o invaded the empire on their &s;ide, pouring down like an inundation from the north, and attempting to fix their re&s;i|dence in the kingdom of Thrace&punc; To oppo&s;e both the&s;e inva&s;ions, Gordian prepared an army, and having gained &s;ome victories over the Goths, whom he obliged to retire, he turn|ed his arms again&s;t the Per&s;ians, whom he de|feated upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, and forced to re|turn home with di&s;grace. In gaining the&s;e ad|vantages, Mi&s;ithaeus, whom he had made Praetorian prefect, had the principal &s;hare; his wi&s;dom directed to &s;ucce&s;s, and his courage in&s;ured it.

Philip was about forty years old when he came to the throne, being the &s;on of an ob&s;cure Ara|bian, who had been captain of a band of rob|bers. Upon his exaltation, he a&s;&s;ociated his
<PB N="442" REF="448">
&s;on, a boy of &s;ix years of age, as his partner in the empire; and, in order to &s;ecure his power at home, made peace with the Per&s;ians, and marched his army towards Rome. On his way, having conceived a de&s;ire to vi&s;it his native country of Arabia, he built there a city called Philopolis; and from thence returning to Rome, he was received as emperor, and treated with all the marks of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, tho' not of joy. Perhaps it was to put the people into good humour, that he cau&s;ed the &s;ecular games to be celebrated, with a magnificence &s;uperior to any of his predece&s;&s;ors, it being ju&s;t a thou&s;and years after the building of the city. Upon occa&s;ion of the&s;e games, we are told, that both Philip and his &s;on were converted to chri&s;tianity. However this be, a murderer and an ungrateful u&s;urper, does no great ho|nour to whatever opinion he may happen to embrace. We have little account of the latter part of his reign in the wretched and muti|lated hi&s;tories of the times; we only learn, that the Goths, renewing their inva&s;ions, Ma|rinus, Philip's lieutenant, who was &s;ent again&s;t them, revolted, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be de|clared emperor. This revolt, however, was but of &s;hort duration; for the army which had rai&s;ed him, repenting of their ra&s;hne&s;s, depo&s;ed him with equal levity, and put him to death. Decius was the per&s;on whom Philip appointed
<PB N="443" REF="449">
to command in the room of the revolting ge|neral. The chief merit of Decius with the emperor was, that when Marinus had rebelled, he averred, in the &s;enate, That the traitor's pre&s;umption would be very &s;hortly his ruin; which, when it happened accordingly, Philip appointed him to &s;ucceed in the command of the rebellious army. Decius, who was a man of great &s;ubtlety, being thus entru&s;ted with &s;o much power, upon arriving at the army, found that the &s;oldiers were re&s;olved on inve&s;ting him with the &s;upreme authority. He, therefore, &s;eemed to &s;uffer their importunities, as if thro' con&s;traint; and, in the mean time, &s;ent Philip word, that he had unwillingly a&s;&s;umed the title of emperor, the better to &s;ecure it for the right|ful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; adding, that he only looked for a convenient opportunity of giving up his pre|ten&s;ions and title together. Philip, however, knew mankind too well, to rely upon &s;uch pro|fe&s;&s;ions: he, therefore, got together what forces he could, from the &s;everal provinces, and led them forward towards the confines of Italy. However, the army was &s;carce arrived at Verona, when it revolted in favour of De|cius, and &s;etting violently upon Philip, a cen|tinel, with one blow, cut off his head, or ra|ther cleaved it a&s;under, &s;eparating the under jaw from the upper.</P>

<P>It was at this time, that no le&s;s than thirty pretenders were &s;een contending with each other for the dominion of the &s;tate, and adding the calamities of civil-war, to the re&s;t of the misfortunes of this devoted empire.

Hi&s;torians are divided as to their number, names, and preten&s;ions; it only appears, in the ill dige&s;ted accounts of the&s;e times, that they were not at all cotemporary, but &s;ucceeded each other whenever they found an opportunity of a&s;&s;erting their preten&s;ions.

<P>We are not &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of this empe|ror's lineage and country. Some affirm, that he was born in Dalmatia, and de&s;cended from an antient family there; others a&s;&s;ert, that he was a Trojan; and others, &s;till, that he was &s;on to the emperor Gordian. But, whatever might have been his de&s;cent, his merits were by no means doubtful. He was a man of great valour and conduct, having performed the mo&s;t excellent &s;ervices again&s;t the Goths, who had long continued to make their irruptions
<PB N="454" REF="460">
into the empire. He was now about fifty-five years old, equally remarkable for the &s;trength of his body and the vigour of his mind; he was cha&s;te and temperate, a rewarder of the good, and a &s;evere puni&s;her of &s;uch as tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the laws. Thus endowed, therefore, he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, put a &s;top to the precipitate decline of the empire, and, once more, &s;eemed to re&s;tore the glory of Rome.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, upon being made emperor, was again&s;t Aureolus, an u&s;urper of the empire, whom he defeated near Milan. His next expedition was to oppo&s;e the Goths, again&s;t whom he had a very numerous army. The&s;e barbarians had made their principal and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful irruptions into Thrace and Macedonia, &s;warmed over all Greece, and had pillaged the famous city of Athens, which had long been the &s;chool of all the polite arts to the Romans. The Goths, however, had no veneration for the&s;e embelli&s;hments that tend to &s;often and humanize the mind, but de&s;troy|ed all monuments of ta&s;te and learning with the mo&s;t &s;avage alacrity. It was upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, that having heaped together a large pile of books, in order to burn them, one of their commanders di&s;uaded them from the de&s;ign, alledging, that the time which the Grecians &s;hould wa&s;te on books, would only render them more unqualified for war. But
<PB N="455" REF="461">
the empire &s;eemed to tremble, not only on that &s;ide, but almo&s;t on every quarter. At the &s;ame time, above three hundred thou&s;and of the&s;e barbarians (the Herulies, the Trutangi, the Virturgi, and many namele&s;s and unciviliz'd nations) came down the river Danube, with two thou&s;and &s;hips, fraught with men and ammunition, &s;preading terror and deva&s;tation on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of univer&s;al di&s;may, Claudius, alone, &s;eemed to continue un&s;haken. He marched his di&s;proportioned army again&s;t the &s;avage invaders, and, though but ill pre|pared for &s;uch an engagement, as the forces of the empire were then employed in different parts of the world, he came off victorious, and made an incredible &s;laughter of the enemy. The whole of their great army was either cut to pieces or taken pri&s;oners; hou&s;es were filled with their arms, and &s;carce a province of the empire, that was not furni&s;hed with &s;laves, from tho&s;e that &s;urvived the defeat.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were followed by many others in different parts of the empire; &s;o that the Goths, for a con&s;iderable time after, made but a feeble oppo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. AURELIAN, the Thirty-fifth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="270" UNIT="A.D."> IMMEDIATELY after the death of Claudius, the army made unanimous choice of Aurelian, who was at that time ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and e&s;teemed the mo&s;t valiant com|mander of his time. However, his promotion was not without oppo&s;ition, on the part of the &s;enate, as Quintillus, the brother of the de|cea&s;ed emperor, put in his claim, and was, for awhile, acknowledged at Rome. But his au|thority was of very &s;hort duration; for find|ing him&s;elf abandoned by tho&s;e who at fir&s;t
<PB N="457" REF="463">
in&s;tigated him to declare for the throne, he cho&s;e to prevent the &s;everity of his rival, by a voluntary death; and cau&s;ing his veins to be opened, expired after having reigned but &s;eventeen days.</P>
<P>Aurelian being thus univer&s;ally acknowleged by all the &s;tates of the empire, a&s;&s;umed the command, with a greater &s;hare of power than his predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed for &s;ome time be|fore. This active monarch was born of mean and ob&s;cure parentage in Dacia, and was about fifty-five years old at the time of his coming to the throne. He had &s;pent the early part of his life in the army, and had ri&s;en through all the gradations of military duty. He was of un|&s;haken courage and amazing &s;trength; he, in one &s;ingle engagement, killed forty of the enemy with his own hand, and above nine hundred at &s;everal different times. In &s;hort, his valour and expedition were &s;uch, that he was compar'd to Julius Cae&s;ar; and, in fact, only wanted mildne&s;s and clemency to be every way his equal.</P>
<P>The whole of this enterprizing monarch's reign was &s;pent, in repre&s;&s;ing the irruptions of the northern nations; in humbling every other pretender to the empire, and puni&s;hing the mon&s;trous irregularities of his own &s;ubjects. He defeated the Morcomanni, a fierce and ter|rible nation of Germany, that had invaded
<PB N="458" REF="464">
Italy, in three &s;everal engagements, and at length totally de&s;troyed their whole army. He was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t Zenobia, the queen of the Ea&s;t, a woman of the mo&s;t heroic qualifications, who had long di&s;claimed the Roman power, and e&s;tabli&s;hed an empire of her own. To oppo&s;e this extraordinary wo|man, Aurelian pa&s;&s;ed his army over into A&s;ia, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all the ob&s;tructions that were oppo&s;ed again&s;t him, he at length &s;ate down before Tyana, a city of Capadocia, which &s;eemed re&s;olved to hold out again&s;t him, and actually for &s;ome time &s;topt his progre&s;s. The unexpected ob&s;tinacy of the be&s;ieged, &s;erved not a little to enrage the emperor, who was naturally precipitate and furious. He vowed, that upon taking the city, he would &s;o puni&s;h the inhabitants, as not to leave a dog alive among them. After &s;ome time the city was taken: and when his whole army expected the plunder of &s;o wealthy a place, and put him in mind of his former prote&s;tations, he re|&s;trained their impetuo&s;ity, and only ordered all the dogs in the place to be de&s;troyed. He afterwards pretended that he was re&s;trained from &s;atiating his re&s;entment on the inhabi|tants, by an apparition of the famous Appol|lonius, that warn'd him not to de&s;troy his birth|place. This excu&s;e was no doubt fictitious;
<PB N="459" REF="465">
but we can ea&s;ily pardon fal&s;ehood, when it is brought to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of humanity.</P>
<P>From Tyana he marched to meet the enemy, who waited his approach, near the city of Eme&s;a in Syria. Both armies were very powerful and numerous; the one trained up under the mo&s;t valiant leader of his time; the other led on by a woman, that &s;eemed born to controle the pride of man. The battle was long and ob&s;tinate; victory at one time leaned to the &s;ide of the A&s;iatics; but the per&s;everance of Aurelian's generals, at la&s;t, carried the day. The enemy were defeated, and Zenobia was obliged to fly to Palmyra for &s;afety. But &s;he was &s;oon pur&s;ued thither by the conqueror, who did all in his power to induce her to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; but the haughty queen refu&s;ed his proferred terms of life and &s;ecurity with &s;corn, relying on the &s;uccours which &s;he expected from the Per&s;ians, the Saracens, and the Ar|menians. However, Aurelian's diligence &s;ur|mounted every ob&s;tacle; he intercepted the Per&s;ian auxiliaries and di&s;per&s;ed them; the Saracens &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and the Arme|nians were, by plau&s;ible promi&s;es, led over to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;t. Thus Zenobia, deceived in her &s;uccour, and de&s;pairing of relief, at|tempted to fly into Per&s;ia; but was taken by a cho&s;en body of hor&s;e &s;ent to pur&s;ue her. The city of Palmyra likewi&s;e &s;ubmitted to the con|queror;
<PB N="460" REF="466">
and Longinus, the celebrated critic, and &s;ecretary to the queen, was by Aurelian's order put to death. Zenobia was re&s;erved to grace his triumph, and was afterwards allotted &s;uch lands, and &s;uch an income, as &s;erved to main|tain her in almo&s;t her former &s;plendor.</P>
<P>Aurelian having thus brought back peace to the empire, endeavoured, by the rigours of ju&s;tice, to bring back virtue al&s;o. He was very &s;trict in puni&s;hing the crimes of the &s;oldiery; and in his orders to his lieutenants, in&s;i&s;ted that the pea&s;ants &s;hould not be plun|dered upon any pretences; that not even a grape, a grain of &s;alt, or a drop of oil, &s;hould be exacted unju&s;tly.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed a &s;oldier, who had committed adultery with his ho&s;te&s;s, to have his feet tied to the tops of two trees, forcibly bent at top to meet each other; which being let loo&s;e, and &s;uddenly recoiling, tore the criminal in two. This was a &s;everity that might take the name of cruelty; but the vices of the time, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, required it. In the&s;e puni&s;hments in|flicted on the guilty, the Chri&s;tians, who had all along been growing more numerous, were &s;harers. Again&s;t the&s;e he drew up &s;everal letters and edicts, which &s;hewed that he intend|ed a very &s;evere per&s;ecution; but, if we may believe the credulous hi&s;torians of the times, he was deterred ju&s;t as he was going to &s;ign
<PB N="461" REF="467">
them, by a thunder-bolt, which fell &s;o near his per&s;on, that all people judged him to be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>But, however Heaven might have inter|po&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, it is certain, that his &s;everities, at la&s;t, were the cau&s;e of his de&s;truc|tion. Mene&s;thus, his principal &s;ecretary, hav|ing been threatened by him, for &s;ome fault, which he had committed, began to con&s;ider how he might prevent the meditated blow. For this purpo&s;e he forged a roll of the names of &s;everal per&s;ons, whom he pretended the emperor had marked out for death, adding his own to &s;trengthen him in the confidence of the party. The &s;crole, thus contrived, was &s;hewn with an air of the utmo&s;t &s;ecre&s;y to &s;ome of the per&s;ons concern'd; and they, to procure their &s;afety, immediately agreed with him to de&s;troy the emperor. This re&s;olution was &s;oon put into execution; for, as the emperor pa&s;&s;ed, with a &s;mall guard, from Uraclea, in Thrace, towards Byrantum, the con&s;pirators &s;et upon him at once, and &s;lew him with very &s;mall re|&s;i&s;tance.

<P>UPON the death of Tacitus, the army &s;eemed divided in the choice of an emperor; one part of it cho&s;e Florian, brother to the decea&s;ed; but the majority were for &s;ome time undetermined. They alledged among&s;t each other, the nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing one eminent for valour, hone&s;ty, piety, clemency, and probity; but the la&s;t virtue being that chiefly in&s;i&s;ted upon, the whole army, as if by common con|&s;ent, cried out that Probus &s;hould be emperor.

<P>Probus was forty-four years old when he a&s;cended the throne, being born of noble parentage at Sirmium in Pannonia, and bred

up a &s;oldier from his youth. He began early to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf for his di&s;cipline and valour; being frequently the fir&s;t man that, in be&s;ieging towns, &s;caled the walls, or that bur&s;t into the enemy's camp. Nor was he le&s;s remarkable for &s;ingle combats, and &s;aving the lives of many eminent citizens. Nor were his activity and courage, when elected to the em|pire, le&s;s apparent than in his private &s;tation. Every year now produced only new calamities to the empire; and fre&s;h irruptions on every &s;ide threatened univer&s;al de&s;olation: perhaps no other abilities but tho&s;e of Probus were capable of oppo&s;ing the&s;e united inva&s;ions. He flew with an army to repre&s;s the Germans in Gaul, of whom he &s;lew four hundred thou&s;and. He then marched into Dalmatia, to oppo&s;e and &s;ubdue the Sarmatians. From thence he led his forces into Thrace, and forced the Goths to &s;ue for peace. He, after that, turned his arms to|wards A&s;ia; &s;ubdued the province of I&s;auria; and, marching onward, conquered a people called the Blemii; who, leaving their native fore&s;ts of Aethiopia, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Arabia and Judea. Nar&s;ius, al&s;o, the king of Per&s;ia, &s;ubmitted at his approach; and upon his return into Europe, he divided the depo|pulated parts of Thrace among its barbarous
<PB N="466" REF="472">
invaders: a circum&s;tance that afterwards pro|duced great calamities to the empire.</P>
<P>His diligence was not le&s;s con&s;picuous in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing inte&s;tine commotions. Saturnius, be|ing compelled by the Egyptains to declare him|&s;elf emperor, was defeated and &s;lain. Proculus al&s;o (a per&s;on remarkable only for his great attachment to women, and who boa&s;ted in a letter, that, having taken an hundred Sarmatian virgins pri&s;oners, he deprived ten of that name in one night, and all the re&s;t within a fortnight) &s;et up again&s;t the emperor, but was compelled to fly, and at length delivered up by the Ger|mans. At the &s;ame time, Bonolus (who was as remarkable a votary to Bacchus, being able to drink as much wine as ten could do, without being di&s;ordered) rebelled, and, being over|come, hanged him&s;elf in de&s;pair. Probus, when he &s;aw him, immediately after his death, could not avoid pointing to him, and &s;aying, "There hangs not a man, but a bottle." Still, however, notwith&s;tanding every effort to give quiet to the empire, the barbarians who &s;ur|rounded it, kept it in continual alarms. They were frequently repul&s;ed into their native wilds, but they as certainly returned with fre&s;h rage and increa&s;ed ferocity. The Goths and Vandals finding him engaged in quelling do|me&s;tic di&s;putes, renewed their accu&s;tomed in|roads, and once more felt the puni&s;hment of
<PB N="467" REF="473">
their pre&s;umption. They were conquered in &s;everal engagements, and Probus returned in triumph to Rome. His active temper, how|ever, would not &s;uffer him to continue at re&s;t while any of the enemy were left to conquer. In his la&s;t expedition, he led his &s;oldiers again&s;t the Per&s;ians; and going through Sir|mium, the place of his nativity, he there &s;et &s;everal thou&s;ands of his &s;oldiers upon draining a fen that was incommodious to the inhabi|tants. The fatigues of this undertaking, and the great re&s;traint that was laid upon the &s;oldiers licentious manners, produced a con|&s;piracy, which ended in his ruin. For taking the opportunity, as he was marching into Greece, they &s;et upon, and &s;lew him, after he had reigned &s;ix years and four months, with general approbation. As an in&s;tance of the e&s;teem, which even his rebellious army had for him, they erected him a &s;umptuous monument with this epitaph. <HI>Here lies the emperor Probus, truly de&s;erving the name; a &s;ubduer of barbarians, and a conqueror of u&s;urpers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. CARUS and his two &s;ons, CARINUS and NUMERIAN, making together the thirty-eighth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="282" UNIT="A.D."> THE &s;hort continuance of this triumvirate, has given hi&s;torians but little room for any thing very material concerning their reign. Carus, who was praetorian prefect to the de|cea&s;ed emperor, was cho&s;en by the army to &s;ucceed him; and he, to &s;trengthen his autho|rity, united his two &s;ons, Carinus and Nume|rian, with him in command; the former of whom was as much &s;ullied by his vices, as the younge&s;t was virtuous, mode&s;t and courageous. The new emperor had &s;carce time to puni&s;h the murderers of the late monarch, when he was alarmed by a fre&s;h irruption of the Sar|matians, over whom he gained a &s;ignal victory. The Per&s;ian monarch al&s;o made &s;ome attempts upon the empire; but Carus a&s;&s;ured his emba&s;|&s;adors, that if their ma&s;ter per&s;i&s;ted in his ob&s;tinacy, all his field &s;hould &s;hortly be as bare as his own bald head, which he &s;hewed them. In con&s;equence of this threat, he marched to
<PB N="460" REF="475">
the very walls of Cte&s;iphon, and a dreadful battle en&s;uing, he once more gained a complete victory. What the re&s;ult of this &s;ucce&s;s might have been, is not known, for he was &s;hortly after &s;truck dead, by lightning, in his tent, with many others that were round him.</P>
<P>Numerian, the younge&s;t &s;on, who accom|panied his father in this expedition, was in|con&s;oleable for his death, and brought &s;uch a di&s;order upon his eyes, with weeping, that he was obliged to be carried along with the army, &s;hut up in a clo&s;e litter. The peculiarity of his &s;ituation, after &s;ome time, excited the am|bition of A&s;per his father-in-law, who &s;uppo&s;ed that he could now, without any great danger, aim at the empire him&s;elf. He therefore hired a mercinary villian to murder the emperor in his litter; and the better to conceal the fact, gave out that he was &s;till alive, but unable to endure the light. In this manner was the dead body carried about for &s;ome days, A&s;per con|tinuing to attend it with the utmo&s;t apperance of re&s;pect, and to take orders as u&s;ual. The offen&s;ivene&s;s, however, of its &s;mell, at length, di&s;covered the treachery, and excited an uni|ver&s;al uproar throughout the whole army. In the mid&s;t of this tumult, Diocle&s;ian, one of the mo&s;t noted commanders of his time, was cho&s;en emperor, and with his own hand &s;lew A&s;per; having thus, as it is &s;aid, fulfilled a
<PB N="470" REF="476">
prophecy, which had &s;aid that Diocle&s;ian &s;hould be emperor after he had &s;lain a boor.</P>
<P>Carinus, the remaining &s;on, did not long &s;urvive his father and brother; for giving him|&s;elf up to his vices, and yet, at the &s;ame time, oppo&s;ing the new-made emperor, the com|petitors led their forces into Mae&s;ia, where Diocle&s;ian being victorious, Carinus was &s;lain, by a tribune of his own army, who&s;e wife he had formerly abu&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. DIOCLESIAN, the Thirty-ninth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="284" UNIT="A.D."> DIOCLESIAN was a per&s;on of mean birth; being accounted, according to &s;ome, the &s;on of a &s;crivener; and of a &s;lave, accord|ing to others. He received his name from Dioclea, the town in which he was born, and was about forty years old when he was elected to the empire. He owed his exaltation entire|ly to his merit; having pa&s;t through all the gradations of office, with &s;agacity, courage and &s;ucce&s;s. Nor did the beginning of his reign, in the lea&s;t, deceive the expectations his &s;ub|jects
<PB N="471" REF="477">
had formed in his favour. He pardoned all his enemies that had joined with Corinus, without injuring either their fortunes or ho|nours. Con&s;cious al&s;o, that the weight of empire was too heavy for one alone to &s;u&s;tain, he took in Maximian, his general, as a partner in the fatigues of duty, making him his equal and companion on the throne. Thus mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, the&s;e two continued to live in &s;trict friend&s;hip, and tho' &s;omewhat differing in temper (as Maximian was rather a man of vicious inclinations) yet they con|curred in promoting the general good, and humbling their enemies. And it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved that there never was a period, in which there were more numerous or formidable enemies to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants and labourers in Gaul, made a dangerous in&s;urrection, under the conduct of Amandus and Helianus, but were &s;ubdued by Maximian. Achilleus, who commanded in Egypt, proclaimed him&s;elf emperor; and it was not without many bloody engagements, that he was overcome, and condemned by Diocle&s;ian to be devoured by lions. In Africa, the Roman legions, in like manner, joined with many of the natives, &s;eized upon the publick revenues, and plundered tho&s;e who continued in their duty. The&s;e were al&s;o &s;ubdued by Maximian; and, after a long, dubious war, con|&s;trained
<PB N="472" REF="478">
to &s;ue for peace. About the &s;ame time, a principal commander in Britain, named Carau&s;ius, proclaimed him&s;elf emperor, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the i&s;land. To oppo&s;e this general's claims, Maximian made choice of Con&s;tantius Chlorus, whom he created Cae&s;ar, and married to Theodora, his daughter-in|law. He, upon his arrival in Britain, finding Carau&s;ius extremely polite, and continually reinforced from Germany, thought proper to come to an accommodation; &s;o that this u&s;urper continued for &s;even years in quiet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole i&s;land, till he was &s;lain by Alectus, his friend and intimate. About this time, al&s;o, Nar&s;eus, king of Per&s;ia and Parthia, began a dangerous war upon the empire, and invaded Me&s;opotamia. To &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy upon this quarter, Diocle&s;ian made choice of Galerius, &s;urnamed Armenta|rius; from the report of his being born of a cow-herd, in Dacia; and he likewi&s;e was created Cae&s;ar. His &s;ucce&s;s al&s;o, though very doubt|ful in the beginning, was, in the end, termi|nated according to his wi&s;hes. The Per&s;ians were overcome in a deci&s;ive engagement, their camp plundered and taken, and the king's wives and children made pri&s;oners of war. There only remained, of all the enemies of the Roman empire, tho&s;e that lay to the north|ward un&s;ubdued. The&s;e were utterly uncon|querable,
<PB N="473" REF="479">
as well upon the account of their &s;avage fiercene&s;s, as the inho&s;pitable &s;everity of the climate and &s;oil from whence they i&s;&s;ued. Ever at war with the Romans, they i&s;&s;ued forth, when the armies that were to repre&s;s their inva&s;ions, were called away; and upon their return, they as &s;uddenly withdrew into cold, barren, and inacce&s;&s;ible places, which only them&s;elves could endure. In this manner the Scythians, Goths, Sarmatians, Alani, Car&s;ii, and Quadi, poured down in incredible num|bers; while every defeat &s;eemed but to encrea&s;e their &s;trength and per&s;everance. Of the&s;e, multitudes were taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ent to people the more &s;outhern parts of the empire; &s;till greater numbers were de&s;troyed; and tho' the re&s;t were driven back to their native fore&s;ts, yet they continued ever mindful of their inve|terate enmity, and, like a &s;avage bea&s;t, only continued inactive, till they had licked their wounds, for a new encounter.</P>
<P>During this interval, as if the external mi|&s;eries of the empire were not &s;ufficient, the tenth and la&s;t great per&s;ecution was renewed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians. This is &s;aid to have ex|ceeded all the former in &s;everity; and &s;uch was the zeal with which it was pur&s;ued, that, in an ancient in&s;cription, we are informed, that they had effaced the name and &s;uper&s;tition of the Chri&s;tians, and had re&s;tored and propagated
<PB N="474" REF="480">
the wor&s;hip of the gods. Their attempts, how|ever, were but the malicious efforts of an ex|piring party; for Chri&s;tianity &s;hortly after was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and triumphed over the malice of all it's enemies. In the mid&s;t of the troubles rai&s;ed by this per&s;ecution, and of the conte&s;ts that &s;truck at the external parts of the &s;tate, Diocle&s;ian and Maximian &s;urprized the world by re&s;igning their dignities on the &s;ame day, and both retiring into private &s;tations. Hi&s;torians are much divided concerning the motives that thus induced them to give up tho&s;e honours which they had purcha&s;ed with &s;o much danger. Some a&s;cribe it to the phi|lo&s;ophical turn of Diocle&s;ian; and others, to his being di&s;gu&s;ted with the ob&s;tinacy of his Chri&s;tian &s;ubjects: but Lactantius a&s;&s;erts, that he was compelled to it, together with his partner, by Galerius, who coming to Nico|media, upon the emperor's recovery from a great &s;ickne&s;s, threatened him with a civil war in ca&s;e he refu&s;ed to re&s;ign. However, this we are well a&s;&s;ured, that he &s;till pre&s;erved a dignity of &s;entiment in his retirement, that might in|duce us to believe he had no other motive for re&s;ignation. Having retired to his birth-place, he &s;pent his time in cultivating his garden, a&s;|&s;uring his vi&s;itors that then only he began to enjoy the world, when he was thought by the re&s;t of mankind to &s;or&s;ake it. When al&s;o &s;ome
<PB N="475" REF="481">
attempted to per&s;uade him to re&s;ume the em|pire, he reply'd, That if they knew his pre&s;ent happine&s;s they would rather endeavour to imitate than di&s;turb it. In this contented man|ner he lived &s;ome time, and at la&s;t died either by poi&s;on or madne&s;s, it is uncertain which. His reign, which continued twenty years, was active and u&s;eful; and his authority, tinctured with &s;everity, was well adapted to the depraved &s;tate of morals at that time.</P>
<P>Maximian, his partner in the empire, and in re&s;ignation, was by no means &s;o contented with his &s;ituation. He longed once more for power, and di&s;turbed the two &s;ucceeding reigns with various efforts to re&s;ume it; attempting to en|gage Diocle&s;ian in the &s;ame de&s;ign. Being ob|liged to leave Rome, where he had bred great confu&s;ion, he went over into Gaul, where he was kindly received by Con&s;tantine, the then acknowledged emperor of the we&s;t. But here, al&s;o, continuing his intrigues, and endeavouring to force his own daughter, and de&s;troy her hu&s;band, he was detected, and condemned to die, by whatever death he &s;hould think pro|per; and Lactantius tells us that he cho&s;e hanging.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. CONSTANTIUS and GALERIUS, making together the Fortieth EMPEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="304" UNIT="A. D"> UPON the re&s;ignation of the two em|perors, the two Cae&s;ars whom they had for|merly cho&s;en, were univer&s;ally acknowledged as their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Con&s;tantius Chlorus, who was &s;o called from the palene&s;s of his complexion, was virtuous, valiant, and merciful. Galerius, on the other hand, was brave; but brutal, in|continent, and cruel. As there was &s;uch a di&s;parity in their tempers, they readily agreed, upon coming into full power, to divide the empire; Con&s;tantius being appointed to govern the we&s;tern parts; namely, Italy, Sicily, the greate&s;t part of Afric, together with Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Germany: Galerius had the ea&s;tern parts allotted to his &s;hare; to wit, Illy|ricum, Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, all the provinces of Greece, and the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, to|gether with Aegypt, Syria, Judaea, and all the countries ea&s;tward. The greatne&s;s of the di|vi&s;ion, however, &s;oon induced the emperor to take in two partners more, Severus and Max|imin, who were made Cae&s;ars, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in
<PB N="477" REF="483">
the conducting of affairs; &s;o that the empire now was under the guidance of four per&s;ons, all inve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority.</P>
<P>We are informed of but few particulars of the reign of Con&s;tantius, except a detail of his character, which appears, in every light, mo&s;t amiable. He was frugal, cha&s;te, and temperate. Being one day reproached by Diocle&s;ian's am|ba&s;&s;adors for his poverty, he only intimated his wants to the people, and in a few hours the &s;ums pre&s;ented him amazed the beholders, and exceeded their highe&s;t expectations.  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Learn from hence," &s;aid he then to the amba&s;&s;a|dors, "that the love of the people is the riche&s;t trea&s;ure; and that a prince's wealth is never &s;o &s;afe as when his people are the guardians of it."</Q> His mercy and ju&s;tice were equally con&s;picuous in his treatment of the Chri&s;tians, whom he would not &s;uffer to be injured; and when, at length, per&s;uaded to di&s;place all the Chri&s;tian officers of his hou&s;hold, that would not change their religion, when &s;ome of them complied, he &s;ent them away in di&s;grace; alledging, That tho&s;e who were not true to their God, would never be faithful to their prince.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd year of his reign, he went over into Britain, and leaving his &s;on Con&s;tantine as a kind of ho&s;tage in the court of his partner in the empire, took up his re&s;idence at York. He
<PB N="478" REF="484">
there continued in the practice of his u&s;ual virtues, till falling &s;ick, he began to think of appointing his &s;on for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He ac|cordingly &s;ent for him with all &s;peed; but he was pa&s;t recovery before his arrival: notwith|&s;tanding, he received him with marks of the utmo&s;t affection, and rai&s;ing him&s;elf in his bed, gave him &s;everal u&s;eful in&s;tructions, particularly recommending the Chri&s;tians to his care. He then bequeathed the empire to his care, and crying out that none but the pious Con&s;tantine &s;hould &s;ucceed him, he expired in his arms.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Galerius, his partner in the empire, being informed of Con&s;tantine's advancement, te&s;tified the mo&s;t ungovernable rage, and was even going to condemn the me&s;|&s;enger who brought him the account: but be|ing di&s;&s;uaded, he &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in what he could not prevent, and &s;ent him the marks of royalty; but at the &s;ame time, declared Severus emperor, in oppo&s;ition to his in|tere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t about this time al&s;o, another pretender to the empire &s;tarted up. This was Maxentius, a per&s;on of mean extraction, but very much fa|voured by the &s;oldiers, whom he permitted to pillage at di&s;cretion. Thus there were &s;everal intere&s;ts at the &s;ame time, in oppo&s;ition to each other; and all con&s;piring each other's down|fall.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="485">
In order to oppo&s;e Maxentius, Severus led a numerous army towards the gates of Rome; but his &s;oldiers con&s;idering again&s;t whom they were to fight, immediately abandoned him; and &s;hortly after, he put an end to his own life, by opening his veins.</P>
<P>To revenge his death, Galerius marched in|to Italy, re&s;olving to ruin the inhabitants, and to de&s;troy the whole &s;enate. His &s;oldiers, how|ever, upon their approaching the capital, began to waver in their re&s;olutions; wherefore, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to entreaties, im|ploring them not to abandon him; and retiring by the &s;ame route by which he had advanced, made Licinius, who was originally the &s;on of a poor labourer in Dacia, Cae&s;ar, in the room of Severus, who was &s;lain. This &s;eemed to be the la&s;t act of his power, for &s;hortly after he was &s;eized with a very extraordinary di&s;order in his privities, which baffled all the &s;kill of his phy&s;icians, and carried him off, after he had langui&s;hed in torments for near the &s;pace of a year.</P>
<P>His cruelty to the Chri&s;tians was one of the many crimes alledged again&s;t him; and their hi&s;torians have not failed to aggravate the cir|cum&s;tances of his death as a judgment from Heaven for his former impiety. However this be, he abated much of his &s;everities again&s;t
<PB N="480" REF="486">

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. CONSTANTINE the GREAT, the Forty-fir&s;t EM|PEROR of ROME.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="311" UNIT="A.D."> CONSTANTINE being thus delivered from his greate&s;t opponent, might now be con&s;idered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more power than any of his rivals in authority, who were yet remaining. The empire was at that time divided between him and three others: Maxentius, who governed in Rome; a per&s;on of a cruel di&s;po&s;ition, and a &s;tedfa&s;t &s;upporter of pagani&s;m: Licinius, who was adopted by Galerius, and commanded in the ea&s;t: and likewi&s;e Maximin, who had for|merly been declared Cae&s;ar with Severus, and who al&s;o governed &s;ome of the ea&s;tern pro|vinces.</P>
<P>Whether the empire was by this time &s;ick of it's inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, or whether each of it's commanders was content with his &s;hare, is not material to enquire; but, for a time, all things &s;eemed to wear a peaceful appearance; till, at length, either ambition, or the tyrannical con|duct
<PB N="481" REF="487">
of Maxentius, induced Con&s;tantine to en|gage in an expedition to expell that commander from Rome; and to make the proper pre|parations for marching into Italy. It was upon this occa&s;ion that he formed a re&s;olution which produced a mighty change in the politics, as well as the morals of mankind; and gave a new turn to the councils of the wi&s;e, and the pur|&s;uits of ambition. One evening, as we are told by Eu&s;ebius, the army being upon it's march towards Rome, Con&s;tantine was taken up with various con&s;iderations upon the fate of &s;ub|lunary things, and the dangers of his approach|ing expedition: &s;en&s;ible of his own incapacity to &s;ucceed without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he em|ployed his meditations upon the opinions that then were chiefly agitated among mankind, and &s;ent up his ejaculations to Heaven to in&s;pire him with wi&s;dom to chu&s;e the path to pur&s;ue. It was then, as the &s;un was declining, that there &s;uddenly appeared a pillar of light in the hea|vens, in the fa&s;hion of a cro&s;s, with this in|&s;cription, &Tgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Tgr;&OHgr; &Ngr;&Igr;&Kgr;&Agr;, <HI>In this overcome.</HI> So ex|traordinary an appearance did not fail to create a&s;toni&s;hment both in the emperor and his whole army, who con&s;idered it as their various di&s;po&s;i|tions led them to believe. Tho&s;e who were at|tached to pagani&s;m, prompted by their au&s;pices, pronounced it to be a mo&s;t inau&s;picious omen, portending the mo&s;t unfortunate events. But
<PB N="482" REF="488">
it made a different impre&s;&s;ion on the emperor's mind; who, as the account goes, was further encouraged by vi&s;ions the &s;ame night. He therefore, the day following, cau&s;ed a royal &s;tandard to be made, like that which he had &s;een in the heavens, and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars, as an en&s;ign of victory and cele&s;tial protection. After this, he con&s;ulted with &s;everal of the principal teachers of Chri&s;tianity, and made a public avowal of that &s;acred per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine having thus attached his &s;oldiers to his intere&s;t, who were mo&s;tly of the Chri&s;tian per&s;ua&s;ion, lo&s;t no time in entering Italy, with ninety thou&s;and foot, and eight thou&s;and hor&s;e; and &s;oon advanced almo&s;t to the very gates of Rome. The unfortunate Maxentius, who had long given him&s;elf up to ea&s;e and debauchery, now began to make preparations, when it was too late. He fir&s;t put in practice all the &s;u|per&s;titious rites which pagani&s;m taught to be nece&s;&s;ary; and then con&s;ulted the Sybiline books, from whence he was informed, that on that great day, the enemy of Rome &s;hould peri&s;h. This prediction, which was equivocal, he ap|plied to Con&s;tantine; wherefore, leaving all things in the be&s;t po&s;ture, he advanced from the city, with an army of an hundred and &s;e|venty thou&s;and foot, and eighteen thou&s;and hor&s;e. The engagement was, for &s;ome time,
<PB N="483" REF="489">
fierce and bloody, till his cavalry being routed, victory declared upon the &s;ide of his opponent, and he him&s;elf was drown'd in his flight, by the breaking down of a bridge, as he attempt|ed to cro&s;s the river Tyber.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine, in con&s;equence of this victory; entering the city, di&s;claimed all prai&s;es which the &s;enate and people were ready to offer; a&s;cribing his &s;ucce&s;s to a &s;uperior power. He even cau&s;ed the cro&s;s, which he was &s;aid to have &s;een in the heavens, to be placed at the right of all his &s;tatues with this in&s;cription. <HI>That under the influence of that victorious cro&s;s Con&s;tantine had delivered the city from the yoke of tyrannical power, and had re&s;tored the &s;enate and people of Rome to their ancient authority.</HI> He afterwards ordained that no criminal &s;hould&punc; for the future, &s;uffer death by the cro&s;s, which had formerly been the mo&s;t u&s;ual way of puni&s;hing &s;laves convicted of capital offences. Edicts were &s;oon after i&s;&s;ued, declaring that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould be ea&s;ed from all their grievances, and received into places of tru&s;t and authority. Thus the new religion was &s;een at once to prevail over the whole Roman empire; and, as that enormous fabric had been built and guided upon pagan principles, it lo&s;t a great deal of its &s;trength and coherence, when tho&s;e principles were thus at once &s;ub|verted.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="490">
Things continued in this &s;tate for &s;ome time, Con&s;tantine, all the while, contributing what was in his power to the intere&s;t of religion, and the revival of learning, which had long been upon the decline, and was almo&s;t wholly extinct in the empire. But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;iduities, the peace of the empire was again di&s;turbed by the preparations of Maxi|min, who governed in the ea&s;t; and who, de|&s;irous of a full participation of power, marched again&s;t Licomius, with a very numerous army&punc; In con&s;equence of this &s;tep, after many con|flicts, a general engagement en&s;ued, in which Maximin &s;uffered a total defeat; many of his troops were cut to pieces, and tho&s;e that &s;ur|vived &s;ubmitted to the conqueror. Maximin, however, having e&s;caped the general carnage, once more put him&s;elf at the head of another army, re&s;olving to try the fortune of the field, but his death prevented the de&s;ign. As he died by a very extraordinary kind of madne&s;s, the Chri&s;tians, of whom he was the declared enemy, did not fail to a&s;cribe his end to a judgment from heaven; but this was the age in which fal&s;e judgments and fal&s;e miracles, made up the bulk of their unin&s;tructive hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine and Licinius thus remaining undi&s;puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and partners in the em|pire, all things promi&s;ed a peaceable continu|ance of friend&s;hip and power. However, it
<PB N="485" REF="491">
was &s;oon found, that the &s;ame ambition that aimed after a part, would be content with nothing le&s;s than the whole. Pagan writers a&s;cribe the rupture, between the&s;e two poten|tates, to Con&s;tantine; while the Chri&s;tians, on the other hand, impute it wholly to Licinius. Both, perhaps, might have concurred, for Licinius is convicted of having per&s;ecuted chri&s;tianity, which was &s;o highly favoured by his rival; and Con&s;tantine is known to have been the fir&s;t to begin the preparations for an open rupture. Both &s;ides exerted all their power to make oppo&s;ition; and, at the head of very formidable armies, came to an engage|ment near Cybalis, in Panonia. Con&s;tantine, previous to the battle, in the mid&s;t of his chri&s;tian bi&s;hops, begged the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven; while Licinius, with equal zeal, called upon the pagan prie&s;t, to intercede with the gods in his favour. The &s;ucce&s;s was on the &s;ide of truth; Con&s;tantine, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the enemy, became victorious; took their camp; and, after &s;ome time, com|pelled Licinius to &s;ue for a truce, which was agreed upon. But this was of no long con|tinuance; for &s;oon after the war breaking out afre&s;h, and the rivals coming once more to a general engagement, it proved deci&s;ive. Li|cinius was entirely defeated, and pur&s;ued by Con&s;tantine into Nicomedia, where he &s;ur|rendered
<PB N="486" REF="492">
him&s;elf up to the victor; having fir&s;t obtained an oath that his life &s;hould be &s;pared, and that he &s;hould be permitted to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in retirement. This, however, Con&s;tantine &s;hortly after broke; for either fearing his de&s;igns, or finding him ac|tually engaged in fre&s;h con&s;piracies, he com|manded him to be put to death, together with Martian, his general, who, &s;ome time before, had been created Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine being now &s;ole monarch of the empire, without a rival to divide his power, or any per&s;on from who&s;e claims he could have the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions, re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h chri&s;tianity on &s;o &s;ure a ba&s;is, that no new re|&s;olutions &s;hould &s;hake it. He commanded that in all the provinces of the empire the orders of the bi&s;hops &s;hould be exactly obeyed; a privilege of which, in &s;ucceeding times, the&s;e fathers made but a very indifferent u&s;e. He called al&s;o a general council of the&s;e, in order to repre&s;s the here&s;ies, that had already crept into the church, particularly that of Arius. To this place repaired about three hundred and eighteen bi&s;hops, be&s;ides a multitude of pre&s;byters and deacons, together with the em|peror him&s;elf; who all, to about &s;eventeen, concurred in condemning the tenets of Arius, who, with his a&s;&s;ociates, was bani&s;hed into a remote part of the empire.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="493">
Having thus re&s;tored univer&s;al tranquility to the empire, he was not able to ward off the calamities of a more dome&s;tic nature. As the wretched hi&s;tories of this period are entirely at variance with each other, it is not ea&s;y to tell the motives which induced him to put his wife Fau&s;ta and his &s;on Cri&s;pus to death. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible account is this. Fau&s;ta, the empre&s;s, who was a woman of great beauty, but of extravagant de&s;ires, had long, though &s;ecretly, loved Cri&s;pus, Con&s;tantine's &s;on by a former wife. She had tried every art to in&s;pire this youth with a mutual pa&s;&s;ion; and finding her more di&s;tant efforts ineffectual, had even the confidence to make him an open confe&s;&s;ion of her de&s;ires. This produced an explanation, which was fatal to both. Cri&s;pus received her addre&s;&s;es with dete&s;tation; and &s;he, to be re|venged, accu&s;ed him to the emperor. Con|&s;tantine, fired at once with jealou&s;y and rage, ordered him to die without an hearing, nor did his innocence appear till it was too late for redre&s;s. The only reparation therefore that remained, was the putting Fau&s;ta, the wicked in&s;trument of his former cruelty, to death; which was accordingly executed upon her, to|gether with &s;ome others, who had been accom|plices in her fal&s;ehood and treachery.</P>
<P>But the private misfortunes of a few, were not to be weighed again&s;t evils of a more gene|ral
<PB N="488" REF="494">
nature, which the Roman empire &s;hortly after experienced. The&s;e aro&s;e from a mea&s;ure which this emperor conceived and executed, of transferring the &s;eat of the empire from Rome to Byzantium, or Con&s;tantinople, as it was afterwards called. Whatever might have been the rea&s;ons which induced him to this undertaking; whether it was becau&s;e he was offended at &s;ome affronts he had received at Rome, or that he &s;uppo&s;ed Con&s;tantinople more in the centre of the empire; or that he thought the ea&s;tern parts more required his pre&s;ence; experience has &s;hewn that they were weak and groundle&s;s. The empire had long before been in a mo&s;t declining &s;tate; but this, in a great mea&s;ure, gave precipitation to its downfall. After this it never re&s;umed its former &s;plendor, but, like a flower tran&s;planted into a foreign clime, langui&s;hed by degrees, and at length &s;unk into nothing.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t de&s;ign was to build a city, which he might make the capital of the world; and for this purpo&s;e, he made choice of a &s;ituation at Chaledon in A&s;ia Minor; but we are told, that in laying out the ground plan&punc; an eagle caught up the line, and flew with it over to Byzantium, a city, which lay upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Bo&s;phorus. Here, therefore, it was thought expedient to fix the &s;eat of the empire; and, indeed, nature &s;eemed to have formed it with
<PB N="489" REF="495">
all the conveniencies, and all the beauties, which might induce power to make it the &s;eat of re&s;idence. It was &s;ituated on a plain, that ro&s;e gently from the water; it commanded that &s;treight which unites the Mediterranean with the Euxine &s;ea, and was furni&s;hed with all the advantages which the mo&s;t indulgent climate could be&s;tow. This city, therefore, he beau|tified with the mo&s;t magnificent edifices; he divided it into fourteen regions; built a capitol, an amphitheatre, many churches, and other publick works; and, having thus rendered it equal to the magnificence of his idea, he dedi|cated it in a very &s;olemn manner, to the God of  martyrs; in about two years after repairing thither with his whole court. <MILESTONE N="1084" UNIT="A. U. C."><MILESTONE N="330" UNIT="A.D."></P>
<P>This removal produced no immediate al|teration in the government of the empire&punc; the inhabitants of Rome, though with reluctance, &s;ubmitted to the change; nor was there for two or three years any di&s;turbance in the &s;tate, until, at length, the Goths finding that the Ro|mans had withdrawn all their garri&s;ons along the Danube, renewed their inroads, and ravag|ed the country with unheard of cruelty. Con|&s;tantine, however, &s;oon repre&s;t their incur&s;ions, and &s;o &s;traitened them, that near an hundred thou&s;and of their number peri&s;hed by cold and hunger. The&s;e, and &s;ome other in&s;urrections, being happily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the government of
<PB N="490" REF="496">
the empire was divided as follows. Con&s;tantine, the emperor's elde&s;t &s;on, commanded in Gaul and the We&s;tern provinces, Con&s;tantius govern|ed Afric and Illyricum, and Con&s;tans ruled in Italy. Dalmatius, the emperor's brother, was &s;ent to defend tho&s;e parts that bordered upon the Goths; and Annibalianus, his nephew, had the charge of Cappadocia and Armenia Minor. This divi&s;ion of the empire &s;till farther contri|buted to its downfall; for the united &s;trength of the &s;tate being no longer brought to repre&s;s inva&s;ion, the barbarians fought with &s;uperior numbers, and conquered at la&s;t, though often defeated. Con&s;tantine, however, did not live to feel the&s;e calamities. The latter part of his reign was peaceful and &s;plendid; amba&s;&s;adors from the remote&s;t Indies came to acknowlege his authority; the Per&s;ians, who were ready for fre&s;h inroads, upon finding him prepared to oppo&s;e, &s;ent humbly to de&s;ire his friend&s;hip and forgivene&s;s. He was above &s;ixty years old, and had reigned above thirty, when he found his health began to decline. To obviate the effects of his di&s;order, which was an inter|mitting fever, he made u&s;e of the warm baths of the city; but receiving no benefit from thence, he removed, for change of air, to Helenopolis, a city which he had built to the memory of his mother. His di&s;order encrea&s;ing he changed again to Nicomedia, where finding
<PB N="491" REF="497">
him&s;elf without hopes of a recovery, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be baptized; and, having &s;oon after received the &s;acrament, he expired after a memorable and active reign of almo&s;t thirty-two years. This monarch's character is re|pre&s;ented to us in very different lights; the Chri&s;tian writers of that time adorning it with every &s;train of panegyric; the heathens on the contrary, loading it with all the virulence of invective. In fact, it &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of a mixture of virtues and vices, of piety and credulity, of courage and cruelty, of ju&s;tice and ambition. He e&s;tabli&s;hed a religion that continues the ble&s;&s;ing of mankind, but pur&s;ued a &s;cheme of politics that de&s;troyed the empire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII. Of the de&s;truction of the ROMAN EMPIRE, after the death of Con&s;tantine, and the events which ha&s;tened its cata&s;trophe.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO the characters of the Roman emperors have been intimately connected with the hi&s;tory of the &s;tate, and its ri&s;e or decline might have been &s;aid to depend on the virtues and vices, the wi&s;dom or the indolence of tho&s;e who governed it. But from this dreary period its recovery was become de&s;perate; no wi&s;dom could obviate its decadence, no courage oppo&s;e the evils that &s;urrounded it on every &s;ide. In|&s;tead, therefore, of entering into a minute ac|count of the characters of its &s;ucceeding em|perors, it will at pre&s;ent &s;uffice, to take a general &s;urvey of this part of the hi&s;tory, and rather de|&s;cribe the cau&s;es by which the &s;tate was brought down to nothing, than the per&s;ons who neither could ha&s;ten nor prevent its decline. Indeed, if we were to enter into a detail concerning the characters of the princes of tho&s;e times, it &s;hould be tho&s;e of the conquerors, not the con|quered; of tho&s;e Gothic chiefs who led a
<PB N="493" REF="499">
more virtuous, and more courageous people to the conque&s;t of nations corrupted by vice and enervated by luxury.</P>
<P>The&s;e barbarians were at fir&s;t unknown to the Romans, and for &s;ome time after had been only incommodious to them. But they were now become formidable, and aro&s;e in &s;uch numbers, that the earth &s;eemed to produce a new race of mankind, to complete the empire's de&s;truction. They had been encrea&s;ing in their hideous de&s;erts, and amid&s;t regions frightful with eternal &s;news, and had long only waited the opportunity of coming down into a more favourable climate. Again&s;t &s;uch an enemy no courage could avail, nor abilities be &s;ucce&s;sful; a victory only cut off numbers without an ha|bitation, and a name, &s;oon to be &s;ucceeded by others equally de&s;perate and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>The emperors who had to contend with this people, were mo&s;t of them furni&s;hed neither with courage nor conduct to oppo&s;e. Their re&s;idence in A&s;ia &s;eemed to enervate their manners, and produced a de&s;ire in them to be adored like the monarchs of the ea&s;t&punc; Sunk in &s;oftne&s;s, they &s;hewed them&s;elves with le&s;s frequency to the &s;oldiers, they became more indolent, fonder of dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, and more ab&s;tracted from the empire. Con&s;tantius, who reigned thirty-eight years, was weak, timid, and un&s;ucce&s;sful, governed by his
eunuchs<PB N="494" REF="500">
and his wives, and unfit to prop the falling empire. Julian, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;urnamed the Apo&s;tate, upon account of his relap&s;ing into pagani&s;m, was, notwith&s;tanding, a very good and a very valiant prince. He, by his wi&s;dom, conduct and oeconomy, cha&s;ed the barbarians, that had taken fifty towns upon the Rhine, out of their new &s;ettlements; and his name was a terror to them during his reign, which la&s;ted but two years. Jovian and Valentinian had virtue and &s;trength &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the empire from immediately falling under its enemies. No prince &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of re|&s;toring the ancient plan of the empire more than Valentinian; the former emperors had drained away all the frontier garri&s;ons, merely to &s;trengthen their own power at home; but his whole life was employed in fortifying the banks of the Rhine; making levies, rai&s;ing ca&s;tles, placing troops in proper &s;tations, and furni&s;hing them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their &s;up|port; but an event, that no human prudence could for&s;ee, brought up a new enemy to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the univer&s;al de&s;truction.</P>
<P>That tract of land which lies between the Palus Maeotis, the mountains of Cauca&s;us and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, was inhabited by a numerous &s;avage people, that went by the name of the Huns and Allanes. Their &s;oil was fertile, and the inhabitants fond of robbery and plunder.
<PB N="495" REF="501">
As they imagined it impracticable to cro&s;s the Palus Maeotis, they were altogether unac|quainted with the Romans, &s;o that they remain|ed confined within the limits their ignorance had a&s;&s;igned them, while other nations plunder|ed with &s;ecurity. It has been the opinion of &s;ome, that the &s;lime which was rolled down by the current of the Tanais, had, by degrees, formed a kind of incru&s;tation on the &s;urface of the Cimmaerian Bo&s;phorus, over which tho&s;e people are &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed. Others relate that two young Scythians, being in full pur&s;uit of an heifer, the terrified creature, &s;wam over an arm of the &s;ea, and the youths immediately following her, found them&s;elves in a new world, upon the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Upon their return, they did not fail to relate the wonders of &s;trange lands and countries, which they had di&s;covered. Upon this information, an innumerable body of Huns pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;treights, and meeting fir&s;t with the Goths, made that people fly before them. The Goths, in con&s;ternation, pre&s;ented them&s;elves on the banks of the Danube, and, with a &s;uppliant air, entreated the Romans to allow them a place of refuge. This they ea&s;ily obtained from Valens, who a&s;&s;igned them &s;everal portions of land in Thrace, but left them de&s;titute of all needful &s;upplies. Stimmulated, therefore, by hunger and re&s;entment, they &s;oon after ro&s;e
<PB N="496" REF="502">
again&s;t their protectors, and, in a dreadful en|gagement, fought near Adrianople, de&s;troyed Valens him&s;elf, and the greate&s;t part of his army.</P>
<P>It was in this manner the Roman armies grew weaker; &s;o that the emperors, finding it difficult, at la&s;t, to rai&s;e levies in the provinces, were obliged to hire one body of barba|rians to oppo&s;e another. This expedient had its u&s;e in circum&s;tances of immediate danger; but when that was over, the Romans found it was as difficult to rid them&s;elves of their new allies, as of their former enemies. Thus the empire was not ruined by any particular inva|&s;ion, but &s;unk gradually under the weight of &s;everal attacks made upon it. When the bar|barians had wa&s;ted one province, tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t &s;poilers, proceeded on to another. Their deva&s;tations were at fir&s;t limitted to Thrace, My&s;ia, and Panonia; but, when the&s;e countries were ruined, they de&s;troyed Macedonia, The&s;&s;aly and Greece; and from thence they expatiated to Noricum. The empire was in this manner continually &s;hrinking, and Italy, at la&s;t, became the fron|tier.</P>
<P>The valour and conduct of Theodo&s;ius, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, retarded the de&s;truction that had begun in the times of Valens, but upon his death the enemy became irre&s;i&s;tible. A
<PB N="497" REF="503">
large body of Goths had been called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the regular forces of the empire, under the command of Alaric, their king; but what was brought in to &s;top the univer&s;al decline, proved the mo&s;t mortal &s;tab to its &s;ecurity. This Gothic prince, who is repre&s;ented as brave, impetuous and enterprizing, perceiving the weakne&s;s of the &s;tate, and how little Arcadius and Honorius, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Theodo&s;ius, were able to &s;ecure it; being in&s;tigated al&s;o, &s;till further, by the artifices of one P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ufinus, who had de&s;igns upon the throne him&s;elf; this warlike prince, I &s;ay, putting him&s;elf at the head of his barbarous forces, declared war again&s;t his employers, and fought the armies of the empire for &s;ome years with various &s;ucce&s;s. However, in proportion as his troops were cut off, he received new &s;upplies from his native fore&s;ts; and, at length, putting his mighty de&s;igns in execution, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, and poured down, like a torrent, among the fruitful vallies of Italy. This charming region had long been the &s;eat of indolence and &s;en&s;ual delight; its fields were now turned into gar|dens of plea&s;ure, that only &s;erved to enervate the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from having once been a nur&s;ery of military &s;trength, that furni&s;hed &s;oldiers for the conque&s;t of mankind. The timid inhabi|tants, therefore, beheld, with terror, a dreadful enemy ravaging in the mid&s;t of their country,
<PB N="498" REF="504">
while their wretched emperor, Honorius, who was then in Ravenna, &s;till only &s;eemed re&s;olved to keep up his dignity, and to refu&s;e any ac|commodation. But the inhabitants of Rome felt the calamities of the times with double aggravation. This great city, that had long &s;ate as mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, now &s;aw her&s;elf be&s;ieged by an army of fierce and terrible bar|barians; and being crowded with inhabitants, it was reduced, by the extremities of pe&s;tilence and famine, to a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation. In this extremity the &s;enate di&s;patched their am|ba&s;&s;adors to Alarick, de&s;iring him either to grant them peace, upon rea&s;onable terms, or to give them leave to fight it with him, in the open field. To this me&s;&s;age, however, the Gothic monarch only replied, with a bur&s;t of laughter, <HI>"That thick gra&s;s was ea&s;ier cut than thin:"</HI> implying that their troops, when cooped up within the narrow compa&s;s of the city, would be more ea&s;ily overcome, than when drawn out in order of battle. When they came to debate about a peace, he demanded all their riches, and all their &s;laves. When he was a&s;ked, <HI>What then he would leave them;</HI> he &s;ternly replied, <HI>Their lives.</HI> The&s;e were hard conditions for &s;uch a celebrated city to accept; but, com|pelled by the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, they rai&s;ed an immen&s;e trea&s;ure, both by taxation and by &s;tripping the heathen temples; and thus, at
<PB N="499" REF="505">
length, bought off their fierce invader. But this was but a temporary removal of the cala|mity; for Alarick now finding that he might become ma&s;ter of Rome whenever he thought proper, returned with his army, a &s;hort time after; pre&s;&s;ed it more clo&s;ely than he had done before, and at la&s;t took it; but whether by force or &s;tratagem, is not agreed among <MILESTONE N="1163" UNIT="U. C."> hi&s;torians. Thus, that city which for ages <MILESTONE N="410" UNIT="A.D."> had plundered the re&s;t of the world, and en|riched her&s;elf with the &s;poils of mankind; now felt, in turn, the &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, and &s;uffered all that barbarity could inflict, or patience endure. The &s;oldiers had free liberty to pillage all places except the Chri&s;tian churches; and, in the mid&s;t of this horrible de&s;olation, &s;o great was the reverence of the&s;e barbarians for our holy religion, that the pa|gans found &s;afety in applying to the Chri&s;tians for protection. This dreadful deva&s;tation conti|nued for three days; and un&s;peakable were the precious monuments, both of art and learning, that &s;unk under the fury of the&s;e conquerors. However, there were &s;till left numberle&s;s traces of the city's former greatne&s;s; &s;o that this capture &s;eemed rather a correction, than a total overthrow.</P>
<P>But the Gothic conquerors of the We&s;t, tho' they had &s;uffered Rome to &s;urvive its fir&s;t cap|ture, now found how ea&s;y it was to become
<PB N="500" REF="506">
ma&s;ters of it upon any other occa&s;ion. The extent of its walls had, in fact, made it almo&s;t impracticable for the inhabitants to defend them; and, as it was &s;ituated in a plain, it might be &s;tormed without much difficulty. Be&s;ides this, no &s;uccours were to be expected from without, for the number of the people was &s;o extremely dimini&s;hed, that the emperors were obliged to retire to Ravenna; a place &s;o fortified by nature, that they could be &s;afe without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an army. What Alaric, therefore, &s;pared, Ge&s;neric, king of the Vandals, not long after contributed to de&s;troy: his mercile&s;s &s;oldiers, for fourteen days together, raged with implacable fury, in the mid&s;t of that venerable place. Neither private dwellings, nor public buildings; neither &s;ex, nor age, nor religion, were the lea&s;t protection again&s;t their lu&s;t or avarice.</P>
<P>The capital of the empire being thus ran|&s;acked &s;everal times, and Italy overrun by bar|barous invaders, under various denominations, from the remote&s;t &s;kirts of Europe; the we&s;tern emperors, for &s;ome time, continued to hold the title without the power of royalty. Honorius lived till he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of his dominions; his capital taken by the Goths; the Huns &s;eized of Panonia; the Alans, Suevi, and Vandals e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Spain; and the Burgundians &s;ettled
<PB N="501" REF="507">
in Gaul, where the Goths al&s;o fixed them&s;elves at la&s;t. After &s;ome time, the inhabitants of Rome al&s;o, being abandoned by the princes, feebly attempted to take the &s;upreme power into their own hands. Armorica and Britain, &s;eeing them&s;elves for&s;aken, began to regulate them&s;elves by their own laws. Thus the power was entirely broken, and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed the title, only encountered certain de&s;truction. At length, even the very name of emperor of the We&s;t expired upon the abdication of Au|gu&s;tus; and Odoacer, general of the Heruli, a&s;&s;umed the title of king of all Italy. Such was the end of this great empire, that had con|quered the world with its arms, and in&s;tructed them with its wi&s;dom; that had ri&s;en by tem|perance, and fell by luxury; that had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and that fell into ruin when the empire was become &s;o exten&s;ive, that a Roman citizen was but an empty name. Its final di&s;&s;olution happened about five hundred and twenty-two years after the battle of Phar&s;alia, an hundred and forty-&s;ix after the removal of the imperial &s;eat to Con&s;tantinople, and four hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix after the nativity of our Saviour.</P>
