<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Prologue &s;hews the motive of this altera|tion, it may not be improper to mention, that it was fir&s;t hinted to the Author by a Noble Per&s;onage, who has eminent|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the literary world; and who recol|lected to have heard Mr. SOUTHERNE declare, in his latter days, that he mo&s;t heartily regretted his complying with licen|tious ta&s;te, by writing any thing &s;o offen&s;ive to mode&s;ty, as the comic part of his works; e&s;pecially that which was &s;o unna|turally joined to the tragedy of this play.</P>
<P>The Author thinks him&s;elf obliged, in gratitude, to acknow|ledge the very candid reception <HI>his</HI> part of it met with from the polite and judicious audience of EDINBURGH, without one per|&s;on to recommend it, as he cho&s;e to lie concealed; and this ap|probation is the more extraordinary, as the piece laboured un|der &s;ome lamentable deficiencies in the repre&s;entation.</P>
<P><HI>Such lines as have been added, to gratify curio&s;ity, are marked thus</HI> (').</P>

<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's the devil of a fellow, that I can tell you; a prince every inch of him: you have paid dear enough for him, for all the good he'll do you: I was forc'd to clap him in irons, and did not think the &s;hip &s;afe neither.

<P>But who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is &s;on and heir to the great King of An|gola, a mi&s;chievous monarch in tho&s;e parts; who, by his good will, would never let any of his neighbours be quiet. This &s;on was his General, a plaguy &s;ighting fellow: I have formerly had dealings with him for &s;laves, which he took pri&s;oners, and have got pretty roundly by him. But the war being at an end, and nothing more to be got by the trade of the country&mdash;I made bold to bring the prince along with me.</P>

<P>How could you do that?</P>

<P>What! &s;teal a prince out of his own country? Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>

<P>He's naturally inqui&s;itive about the men and manners of the white nations; &s;o, becau&s;e I cou'd give him &s;ome accounts of tho&s;e parts of the world, I grew very much into his 
favour&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'When I made my la&s;t voyage, he had quarrell'd with his father about &s;ome

on this I invited him; I could do no le&s;s, you know, as he had been a friend to me: I prepar'd my entertainment; &s;o he came in the evening, and brought about twenty friends with him; the punch flew about, and as many of his companions, as I thought would be dangerous, I &s;ent dead drunk on &s;hore&mdash;the re&s;t we &s;ecur'd; and &s;o you have the Prince Oroonoko.</P>
