</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Live.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of him!&mdash;he is one of the di&s;graces of his country. There is no general to whom I would pay more re&s;pect; de&s;cended from an antient family, he inhe|rired only a brown mu&s;ket; and after having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in mo&s;t of the Great Duke of Marlborough's&punc; wars, with a bravery, the admiration of every one, is, at the age of &s;ixty-five, nobly rewarded by a brevet for Chel|&s;ea Ho&s;pital, whither, I am told, he is now on his way, and where his wife, a wa&s;her-woman, and his daughter a &s;eam&s;tre&s;s, are waiting his arrival.</P>

<P>Poor old Blenheim!&mdash;Why do you think if as how I had been a general, and Blenheim had &s;erved under me, that I would have broke his poor old heart, by put|ting a parcel of boys before him, becau&s;e one was my Lord this thing's footman, and t'other carried my Lady that thing's lap dog&mdash;</P>

<P>There is &s;omething like wi&s;dom in your re|marks, old gentleman, but mix'd, I think, with rather too much &s;pleen. This public &s;pirit, which you require, is certainly a virtue, but by no means a duty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your &s;tation 'tis a duty&mdash;the very founda|tion of every military virtue.&mdash;Whoever dedicates him|&s;elf to the &s;ervice of his country, &s;hould con&s;ider his country unable to requite his &s;ervices; for in fact, that which he devotes to the public good, is above all price.&mdash;No more of the&s;e complaints then&mdash;'Tis una|voidable in counties like ours, that bravery mu&s;t &s;ome|times fall into neglect, otherwi&s;e there would be no &s;ub|ordination; for how could you reward as you ought an Engli&s;h army, unle&s;s every one could command in chief?</P>

<SPEAKER>Blen.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whom then do you expect to hear your duty&mdash;from the&s;e gentlemen, who never &s;aw fire but in the corner of a chimney? 'Tis true I have been wrong'd, neglected, taken up, impri&s;oned, accu&s;ed of violating the

<P>'Tis not in your power, Sir,&mdash;poor as old Blen|heim is, he has a trea&s;ure in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion infinitely above all yours.</P>
