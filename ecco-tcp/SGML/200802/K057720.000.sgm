<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY TWO GENTLEMEN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NOW, by my &s;anguine hopes, our author cries,</L>
<L>With expectation &s;parkling in her eyes,</L>
<L>There's nothing here &s;hould &s;care me that I &s;ee,</L>
<L>They all are &s;aplings of the tough old tree:</L>
<L>Women, who wear Ely&s;ium in their look,</L>
<L>And men, unconquer'd as their native oak.</L>
<L>But yet a word or two I'll briefly &s;ay,</L>
<L>To prove we're right in naming of our play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of human conduct, in each varied &s;cene,</L>
<L>Th' extreme &s;ucceeds beyond the patient mean;</L>
<L>If eminence in rank our bo&s;oms fire,</L>
<L>If merit to preferment dare a&s;pire,</L>
<L>Follow the active, not the formal part,</L>
<L>"And &s;natch a grace beyond the rules of art."</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="3">
<HI>Bold Strokes,</HI> from bounding genius firmly &s;truck,</L>
<L>Attract &s;ucce&s;s, more than the turns of luck.</L>
<L>The bankrupt &s;windler, though to pay unable,</L>
<L>Oft mends his fortune by the E O table;</L>
<L>Or, failing there, he acts a braver part,</L>
<L>And takes a pur&s;e,<HI>&mdash;a Bold Stroke for the cart.</HI></L>
<L>The game&s;ter too forgets each tender tie,</L>
<L>And ventures his la&s;t guinea on a die,</L>
<L>'Till ruin'd, and repenting of the evil,</L>
<L>He hangs him&s;elf<HI>&mdash;a Bold Stroke for the Devil.</HI></L>
<L>The fortune hunter &s;ports a &s;uit of lace,</L>
<L>In this a Count, a Lord in t'other place,</L>
<L>Succe&s;s at length, begins his married life</L>
<L>At Gretna Green<HI>&mdash;a Bold Stroke for a Wife.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But are bold &s;trokes to vicious men confin'd?</L>
<L>Does virtue lie inactive in the mind?</L>
<L>It cannot be, while England's genius breathes,</L>
<L>And many a brow is deck'd with laurel wreaths.</L>
<L>Bold &s;trokes in war are England's greate&s;t pride;</L>
<L>Think how a HOOD has liv'd, a MANNERS died!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our play holds forth the conque&s;t of a heart,</L>
<L>By one bold &s;troke of nature, not of art.</L>
<L>A female pen calls female virtue forth,</L>
<L>And fairly &s;hews to man her &s;ex's worth.</L>
<L>Could men but &s;ee what female &s;en&s;e can do,</L>
<L>How apt their wit, their con&s;tancy&mdash;how true;</L>
<L><PB N="iii" REF="4">
In vain would rakes the married &s;tate revile,</L>
<L>Nor with the wanton, precious time beguile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is our aim, to rectify the age,</L>
<L>By bringing ri&s;ing follies on the &s;tage;</L>
<L>Be then propitious, let our fears decrea&s;e,</L>
<L>While you, with plaudits, ratify the peace!</L>

<P>No, that's only the occa&s;ional gilding; but 'tis in vain to attempt a de&s;cription of what changed its nature with every moment.

<P>To rival him was not my fir&s;t motive.

<P>I came here, Sir, by the mere&s;t accident.&mdash;The garden door was open, curio&s;ity led me to this apart|ment.&mdash;You came in a moment after, and very civilly lock'd me in with your daughter.</P>
