<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM your writings I received all that in|expre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure and Improvement which Eru|dition ever affords the Mind of the feeling Man: From your Writings I learned to form a ju&s;t Character of tho&s;e illu&s;trious Worthies, your mighty Predece&s;&s;ors, in that Chair where you now &s;it.&mdash;Permit me then, great Man! as a Lover of Poe&s;y, and Reverer of Merit, to pay you this tributary Token of Re&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TIRED with the Importunities of many, I at length &s;elected the following Trifles, and pre&s;ume to pre&s;ent them to the pub|lic eye.</P>
<P>HOW far "Idle Ver&s;es e&s;&s;ayed in early Age," may meet the public Approbation, I cannot tell; but he who endeavours well, &s;urely ought not to be cen&s;ured.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">JUVENILLE Compo&s;itions &s;ometimes meet more good-natured Readers than rigid Critics: may &s;uch be the Fate of this Vo|lume, written by an Author between his fifteenth and nineteenth Years.</P>
<P>SUCH Sen&s;ations as are in the Bo&s;om of a penitent Criminal certain of immediate Death, but unknowing whither his im|mortal Soul may go; &s;uch &s;trong Sen&s;a|tions now beat high in me, whil&s;t with a trembling Hand I pen the&s;e Lines, fearing the fatal Con&s;equences "of flying from the &s;afe Scenes of Privacy to meet in giddy Ha&s;te the public Eye."</P>
<P>BUT as &s;ome of the Productions of my boyi&s;h Fancy had appeared in the different
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
periodical Papers, I the more readily con|&s;ented to this Publication; and the Poems (&s;uch as they are) will be here found more correct.</P>
<P>SOME people will perhaps accu&s;e me of that Vanity which &s;o powerfully predomi|nates in the youthful Mind, for attempt|ing to climb that A&s;cent down which &s;o many have tumbled.&mdash;In what I have written I meant well; I therefore pre&s;ent it to the Public, not with the Arrogance of an a&s;&s;uming young Man, but with all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Mode&s;ty of an Author.</P>

<LG>
<L>"'TIS true we talk of Friend&s;hip much,</L>
<L>"But who are they who can keep touch?"</L>
<L>Thus &s;ung Hibernia's patriot Dean,</L>
<L>In Satire's energetic &s;train;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11">The &s;tory we have now in view,</L>
<L>Will prove his ob&s;ervations true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seventeen hundred pounds a year;</L>
<L>Made <HI>Jack</HI> to all the country dear,</L>
<L>Of it he was no mi&s;er, as</L>
<L>His &s;tarving predece&s;&s;or was,</L>
<L>Who left behind him what he &s;tor'd,</L>
<L>Of gold, the god that he ador'd:</L>
<L>But <HI>Jack,</HI> Sir, liv'd a diff'rent way,</L>
<L>He &s;pent his time in amours gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He'd friends to come to him and dine,</L>
<L>To prodigally drink his wine,</L>
<L>To &s;pend the tedious pa&s;&s;ing hours,</L>
<L>In co&s;tly plea&s;ure's ro&s;eate bow'rs,</L>
<L>To take all from him they cou'd get,</L>
<L>To make him pay their tavern debt,</L>
<L>To give advice thro' private ends,</L>
<L>In &s;hort, <HI>who had &s;o many friends?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<L>But now, alas! the time was come,</L>
<L>When <HI>Jack</HI> had lo&s;t his &s;tately home,</L>
<L>When he con&s;um'd his whole e&s;tate,</L>
<L>That Fame might &s;ound him goodly great,</L>
<L>When he had run in debt to have</L>
<L>Th' expen&s;ive &s;uppers which he gave,</L>
<L>And now the &s;heriffs keepers laid</L>
<L>On hou&s;e, 'till all the debts were paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now, let me think, (&s;ays <HI>Jack</HI>) I've gentry,</L>
<L>Who'll give me diet and my rent free;</L>
<L>There is Samuel, James, and John,</L>
<L>Generous Sidropel and Mun,</L>
<L>Who&s;e numerous friendly actions &s;hew'd</L>
<L>Their tempers ho&s;pitably good,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oft benignity will grant</L>
<L>What my nece&s;&s;ity may want;</L>
<L>With them I'll &s;creen from Law's turmoils,</L>
<L>'Till Fortune more propitious &s;miles."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<L>His ca&s;e to Samuel then he told,</L>
<L>Him Samuel cordially condol'd,</L>
<L>But co&s;tly aid he wou'd not give,</L>
<L>Yet &s;eem'd from teeth to greatly grieve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Jack &s;aw his di&s;&s;embling mode,</L>
<L>He curs'd the gifts he ill be&s;tow'd,</L>
<L>And hied to James's to &s;ojourn&mdash;</L>
<L>But &s;upplication meets with &s;corn:</L>
<L>He rap'd at door, &s;ent in his name,</L>
<L>The &s;ervant with this an&s;wer came:&mdash;</L>
<L>"His Honour &s;ays, he does not know you;</L>
<L>"And bid me the hall-door to &s;how you."</L>
<L>Thus baffled and abus'd by two,</L>
<L>He went to John, and told his woe;</L>
<L>But John, Sir, with a bow polite,</L>
<L>Exclaim'd his hou&s;e was robb'd la&s;t night,</L>
<L>And was it not for that he wou'd</L>
<L>Repay the compliments he ow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="14">
<L><HI>Jack,</HI> &s;tung with di&s;appointment's pain,</L>
<L>At this unmerited di&s;dain,</L>
<L>From tho&s;e he almo&s;t rais'd from want,</L>
<L>Cry'd, "Cou'd I former deeds recant,</L>
<L>"I'd chu&s;e with more judicious ken,</L>
<L>"My friends 'mid unde&s;igning men."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wrap'd in &s;uch thoughts, which woe augment,</L>
<L>To generous Sidropel he went;</L>
<L>Who &s;aid his wife was brought-to-bed;</L>
<L>The Doctor's fee was not yet paid;</L>
<L>The hou&s;e-rent was a heavy debt,</L>
<L>And money he cou'd no where get.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then quick to Mun he bent his way,</L>
<L>And told the Fates' &s;evere decree,</L>
<L>Impell'd by Law's au&s;tere command,</L>
<L>Who&s;e mandate poorne&s;s can't with&s;tand,</L>
<L>To quit in mean Di&s;gui&s;e's garb,</L>
<L>(Profu&s;ion's &s;ure and ju&s;t reward)</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="15">A patrimonial goodly &s;eat,</L>

<L>Ev'n with that cheering ray of hope,</L>
<L>Which might the pre&s;ent angui&s;h &s;top,</L>
<L>He'd pray that to him &s;hou'd be giv'n,</L>
<L>Tran&s;cendent joys, the gifts of Heav'n!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Mun, replies "<HI>my deare&s;t Jack,</HI></L>
<L>"You know the troubles <HI>on my back,</HI></L>
<L>"You know, Lord Love by pa&s;&s;ion led,</L>
<L>"Debas'd, defil'd my nuptial bed;</L>
<L>But when the damages I recover</L>
<L>I'll pay thy friend&s;hip more than over."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor Jack when he had try'd each friend,</L>
<L>And found none who'd a&s;&s;i&s;tance lend,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="16">Went home with &s;orrow in his heart,</L>
<L>Which now felt Penury's galling &s;mart:</L>
<L>Scarce was he in, when noi&s;e at door</L>
<L>Made him his dreadful ca&s;e deplore;</L>
<L>He thought 'twas bailiffs him to take,</L>
<L>But, oh, how plea&s;ing the mi&s;take!</L>
<L>'Twas letter, with the glad account,</L>
<L>He'd got a prize to the amount</L>
<L>Of twice five thou&s;and &s;terling pound,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>His friends</HI> came the &s;ucceeding day,</L>

<L>AH, dear deluder, cau&s;e of all my woe,</L>
<L>Who made me break the &s;olemn nuptial vow;</L>
<L>Who by compul&s;ion and enticing charms,</L>
<L>Seduc'd me from the tend're&s;t hu&s;band's arms,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21">Hear how too late my injur'd lord I mourn,</L>

<L>When I &s;ought much lov'd C&mdash; to plea&s;e,</L>
<L>When I receiv'd thee in a blithe alcove,</L>
<L>Imperial object of my guilty love!</L>
<L>For o'er my head the graceful &s;miles were &s;een</L>

<BIBL>TERENCE.</BIBL>
<P>I am a Man, and ble&s;s'd with manly Feeling.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I WAS brought the other day by &s;ome of my juvenile acquaintance, into a cock-pit, and there heard the mo&s;t gentle reproof that the tender lips of parental love could utter. Johannes, a &s;age gentleman, whom curio&s;ity led to the pit,
<PB N="72" REF="67">
chanced to &s;ee his &s;on Gallus at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, holding wagers; when the battle was terminated, Johannes a&s;ked Gallus did he lo&s;e. "No," re|plied he, with the quick voice of joy, "I have won a crown." "I'm &s;orry for it," returned Johannes." Then after &s;haking his head and making a long pau&s;e, he continued&mdash;
<Q>I hope that crown may not co&s;t you five hundred pounds.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e few words made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind that I in&s;tantly left the pit, and vowed never to enter one again. When I had got home, reflection and &s;ober rea&s;on made me plainly &s;ee the barbarity of that, which is termed an amu&s;ement only by the unfeeling, incon&s;ide|rate, and mean.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e people who are termed Cockers, are in general ignorant, avaricious, indolent, fond of
<PB N="73" REF="68">
inebriety, and fond of accumulating money 'in an ea&s;y way,' as they expre&s;s them&s;elves; with|out once con&s;idering it is al&s;o an ea&s;y way of lo&s;|ing it. What but a &s;ordid de&s;ire of lucre makes a man go to &s;uch an opprobrious place! Youth &s;hould beware how they enter a cock-pit: if they win, they bet on expecting to win more; if they lo&s;e, Hope, which is &s;o predominant in the hu|man mind, &s;timulates them to bet on, with the de&s;ire of recovering their own. Turn your &s;teps far from this &s;eat of immorality and corruption, where the di&s;cordant voices of the bla&s;phemers perpetually prophane that awful name, at the &s;ound of which Virtue &s;hudders with a religious fear.</P>
<P>How many illu&s;trious per&s;onages have fallen unhappy victims to their in&s;atiable pa&s;&s;ion for cock-fighting, and involved their ri&s;ing families

in ruin! that fortune which &s;hould be theirs by hereditary right, the hand of Imprudence has &s;quandered, by di&s;charging the honourable debts at the &s;od.</P>
<P>The barbarity of this epidemic pa&s;time no le&s;s affects the heart with &s;en&s;ations of pity, than the &s;ight of men, who &s;take one half of their fortunes on a black-brea&s;ted duck-wing, of yellow pile affects the mind with wonder. A thou&s;and pounds lo&s;t in a few minutes! &s;uch, in the cour&s;e of years, mu&s;t exhau&s;t a man's pecuniary re&s;ources, were he ma&s;ter even of the riches of Chili and Peru. What do cockers or gamblers of any denomina|tion depend on? Chance, blind chance. The unpropitious termination of a &s;ingle battle may perhaps hurl them headlong from the glittering pinnacles of magnificence, to the va&s;t profundity of poverty, and from thence to the low gloomy
<PB N="75" REF="72">
man&s;ions of confinement, where they may pa&s;s away their dark days till death tran&s;ports them from the mi&s;eries of life.</P>
<P>The pathetic Pope &s;trongly inveighs again&s;t the cruelty practi&s;ed by man to inferior creatures; and the unmanly diver&s;ions of cock-fighting and throwing at cocks, have been reprobated by him, and many of his cotemporaries. I knew a gentle|man who tortured every creature, that his vi&s;itors might compare him to Domitian, becau&s;e that mon&s;ter once filled the powerful chair of domi|nion. I have &s;een him put two flies on a needle, one at the eye, the other at the point, and while they in agonies would pull again&s;t each other, he'd cry&mdash;"Behold Domitian."</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with the &s;tory of Zai, which I recollect to have heard in the happy
<PB N="76" REF="73">
days of boyi&s;h innocence: Zai was the only &s;on of Amazar the wealthy, who had ama&s;&s;ed im|men&s;e riches by bringing merchandize from Egypt, and &s;elling it again at con&s;iderable profit. Amazar, at the age of twenty-nine, met with an irreparable lo&s;s, which drove him to the height of melancholy: this was the death of the beau|tiful Ha&s;ora, to whom he had been eight years joined in all the endearing bands of wedlock.&mdash; The only con&s;olation the di&s;con&s;olate Amazar had, was in the glooms of retirement, care&s;&s;ing little &s;miling Zai, the &s;ole pledge of that pure love he had borne the amiable Ha&s;ora.</P>
<P>Zai had now &s;een &s;even &s;ummers, his lovely vi&s;age and engaging ways made him the delight of every who frequented his father's hou&s;e. But let us now rever&s;e the leaf. Behold the youth (when the cold hand of Death con&s;igned the ten|der parent to the grave) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e riches
<PB N="77" REF="74">
which the hand of Frugality had gathered, to keep him independent of mankind. The pro|mi&s;ing hope of the re&s;pected&mdash;Amazar now &s;pends his whole time in the company of I&s;|maen, the gambler. See! &s;ee! how quickly he empties the foaming goblet of intoxication. Are tho&s;e pale lips the once ro&s;y ones of Zai, which were &s;o often wont to ki&s;s the cooling cup of lime-juice and water?&mdash;Yes, Heaven, they are!&mdash;But what a metamorpho&s;is!</P>
<P>Zai's con&s;titution was &s;oon broke, his money as &s;oon &s;pent. What could he do? He ran in debt to &s;upport nature, and his mercile&s;s creditor thru&s;t him in the di&s;mal confines of a pri&s;on, where he expired a victim to his inordinate de|&s;ires.</P>

APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the north of Ireland I met with a gentleman to who&s;e good nature I am indebted for a copy of the following Poem; it is the production of the late Rev. William Pilkington, Curate of Omagh, capital of the county of Tyrone. This genius is reputed to have been a &s;on of Dean Swift's, by the celebrated Mrs. Laetitia Pilkinton. I am told he was the exact image of Swift, and a man who&s;e abi|lities were univer&s;ally acknowledged; his &s;atiric talent, which was very great, procured him high di&s;re&s;pect from the brethren of the gown: he was a graceful and eloquent preacher, but not a very rigid ob&s;erver of the doctrine he preached.
<PB N="82" REF="77">
The burden of a large family, with the attendant anxieties and cares, extremely depre&s;&s;ed the ge|nerous &s;pirit of this plea&s;ing companion. Think|ing to drown the memory of his afflictions, he frequented Bacchanalian &s;ocieties, and latterly drank &s;trong liquors when alone; this, at length, put a period to his exi&s;tence: he expired, in a manner truly pitiable, a deplorable &s;pectacle of ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
