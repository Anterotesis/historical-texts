<L>See him from place to place with tran&s;port fly,</L>
<L>In &s;earch of plea&s;ure and variety.</L>
<L>When &s;ick of <HI>high life</HI> he begins to grow,</L>
<L>He tries to find a reli&s;h in the <HI>low</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>F&mdash;te</HI> next ari&s;es to his vacant mind,</L>
<L>For there he's &s;ure the coar&s;e&s;t fare to find;</L>
<L>Tho' coar&s;e, yet light, and ea&s;y to dige&s;t,</L>
<L>Nor hurt the head before it meets the brea&s;t.</L>
<L>No heavy &s;entence to perplex the brain,</L>
<L>No &s;earching morals on the mind remain,</L>
<L>But like the froth, di&s;&s;olving in the ta&s;te,</L>
<L>And, ere it meets the lip, begins to wa&s;te:</L>
<L>While in our ears he dins the mighty pother,</L>
<L>It enters one, and hurries out at t'other.</L>
