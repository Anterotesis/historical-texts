<HEAD>Jus Tertii.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN a Man pleads any Point, in which he has no LEGAL INTEREST, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the gaining of which he can propo&s;e to him&s;elf no <HI>ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Advantage, he is re|mov'd <HI>per&s;onali objectione</HI> from pleading &s;uch Point. For the Law encourages no Man to &s;tand in the Way of his Neighbour, un|le&s;s his own Intere&s;t be at Stake.</P>
<P>This per&s;onal Objection is expre&s;s'd common|ly by the Name of <HI>JUSTERTII.</HI> And the Po&s;ition runs thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> to found upon any Alledgance which does not terminate in the legal Intere&s;t of the Proponer, but of a third Party."</Q> Which comes in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, You are not pleading for your &s;elf, but for another"</Q>. And this is the true Touch-&s;tone to di&s;cover when the <HI>Jus Tertii</HI> is well or ill found|ed. If the Proponer can &s;how he has any <HI>legal Intere&s;t,</HI> any <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Benefit or Advantage in making
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the Alledgance, this per&s;onal Objection of <HI>Jus Tertii can never lie again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>In the Application of this Doctrine, the greate&s;t Difficulty is in judging, <HI>what is a legal Intere&s;t;</HI> that every <HI>accidental</HI> or <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> Benefit does not come up to a <HI>legal Intere&s;t</HI> is plain. As to this Matter, all Arguments drawn from po&s;&s;ible Con|tingencies are cut off. A legal Intere&s;t mu&s;t be &s;omething fix'd; &s;omewhat the Proponer is founded in Law to plead upon, and to be cut out of which, he can &s;ub&s;ume upon as an Act of Inju&s;tice. This falls to be e&s;timated and judg'd of, by the Situati|on the Proponer is in, from the Nature of his Claim, and Relation to his Party.</P>
<P>For Example, A Nullity of the Execution of a Warning again&s;t a Tenant to remove, being object|ed again&s;t an Adjudger, who&s;e Adjudication was expired, by another who was not within the Year of him, but both were infeft, the Lords found the Nullity not competent for that &s;econd Adjudger to object, unle&s;s he were either preferable, or to come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> and therefore repelled it as <HI>jus tertii</HI> to him. <HI>Fountainhal, Forbes,</HI> 30th <HI>June</HI> 1708. <HI>Rule</HI> contra <HI>Purdie.</HI> So far the Matter is clear.</P>
<P>In a Removing again&s;t a Tenant, the Defender was not allowed to plead upon the Right of a third Party as preferable to the Pur&s;uer, unle&s;s he would &s;ub&s;ume upon &s;ome Right made to him by the third Party. <HI>Erskine,</HI> Col. <HI>Stuart</HI> contra Laird. of <HI>Grange.</HI> For here the Tenant could not figure the &s;malle&s;t Advantage in pleading upon the Right of the third Party, unle&s;s it were, 1<HI>mo,</HI> A Po&s;|&s;ibility that the third Party would not turn him out. 2<HI>do,</HI> That for one Year, at lea&s;t, he could not, not having given any Warning to the Tenant.
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Both which being <HI>accidental</HI> and <HI>contingent,</HI> the Law re&s;pects not, as not coming up to a <HI>legal In|tere&s;t,</HI> or &s;uch a rea&s;onable Benefit, which being cut out off, he can &s;ub&s;ume that he has met with material Inju&s;tice. Which a Tenant can never &s;ay, who is remov'd upon a legal Warning by any Per&s;on having a colourable Title to the Lands. All his legal Intere&s;t is to pay his Rent &s;ecurely; it belongs not at all to him to object again&s;t the Pur&s;uer's Title, providing <HI>ex facie</HI> it appear to be good; or to dip into the Que&s;tion, Whether &s;ome third Party may not have a better Title.</P>
<P>The like is ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Colvil, December</HI> 1582. Counte&s;s of <HI>Errol contra</HI> Tenants, where a Life|rent being competent to a Lady by her Husband who was only Liferenter him&s;elf; in an Action of Removing again&s;t Tenants at her In&s;tance after her Husband's Decea&s;e, this Exception, that her Liferent was extinct by her Husband's Decea&s;e, was repelled, as being <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the Tenants.</P>
<P>Another Example is mentioned by <HI>Spoti&s;wood, voce, E&s;cheat and Liferent,</HI> 23d <HI>March</HI> 1630. <HI>Murray</HI> contra Commi&s;&s;ary of <HI>Dunkeld.</HI> In a &s;pe|cial Declarator of the Commi&s;&s;ary of <HI>Dunkeld</HI>'s E&s;cheat pur&s;ued by Mr. <HI>Patrick Murray,</HI> the De|fender propon'd an Alledgance upon the ordinary Back-bond given to the Trea&s;urer by the Donatar, which bore, that he &s;hould not u&s;e the Gift to the Prejudice of the Rebel's Creditors. This the Re|bel alledged might be propon'd in his own Name, as well as the Creditors, &s;eeing he was intere&s;ted to &s;ee his Creditors rather paid by his own e&s;cheat|able Goods, than that the Donatar &s;hould meddle therewith, and the Creditors be obliged to have Recour&s;e to his Lands or his Per&s;on. The Lords
<PB N="4" REF="7">
repelled this, as not competent to be proponed in the Rebel's own Name. Here the Rebel had a plain and fix'd Intere&s;t; but &s;till he was denied the Benefit of the Alledgance, becau&s;e it was not a <HI>legal Intere&s;t, &s;ciz.</HI> &s;uch an Intere&s;t or Benefit he was intitled to by Law. Becau&s;e a Backbond of the Nature mentioned in the Deci&s;ion can have no Re&s;pect to the Advantage of the Rebel, who&s;e E&s;cheat falls <HI>in modum poenae,</HI> but re&s;pects &s;olely the Creditors; and therefore the Creditors may plead upon it, the Rebel never can.</P>
<P>In a Declarator of Property, the Defender, pre|tending no Right in his own Per&s;on, was not &s;uffered to make any Objection again&s;t the Pur&s;uer's Title, <HI>Stair</HI> 18, <HI>July</HI> 1662, Lord <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> contra Laird of <HI>Philorth.</HI> Here the Defender, by making the Al|ledgance and removing the Pur&s;uer, could have no other View, but to retain Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome Time longer; which is &s;o far from a legal Intere&s;t, that it is plainly inju&s;tifiable: In re&s;pect it is more rea|&s;onable to give him the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who has &s;ome colourable Title, than to allow it to remain with the Per&s;on who has no Pretence at all.</P>
<P>And in a Declarator of the Property of Teinds, tho' the Title of the Proce&s;s was a Progre&s;s exceedingly ill connected, and labouring under many Infirmities; yet the Lords &s;u&s;tain'd the Title, in the &s;ame Way, as if the Action had been a Reduction and Impro|bation of Land-Rights; and found it to be &s;uffi|cient again&s;t naked Heritors pretending no Right to the Teinds of their Lands; and that it was <HI>jus ter|tii</HI> for them to object again&s;t it. The Defenders yielded, that any pre&s;umptive Title might do in a Que&s;tion of Lands, becau&s;e no Man can pretend the &s;malle&s;t Intere&s;t in or to Lands, but in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="5" REF="8">
of &s;ome Conveyance, &s;ome written Docu|ment, which, if he has not, it is indeed <HI>jus tertii</HI> to object again&s;t any pre&s;umptive Title in the Per|&s;on of another: But that could never happen in a Que&s;tion of Teinds, becau&s;e an Heritor's Right to the Lands, &s;uppo&s;e he has none to the Teinds, gives him a &s;ufficient <HI>Title</HI> and plain <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> to object again&s;t any Man's being declared Titular of his Teinds. Which was inforced from the&s;e Con&s;idera|tions. 1<HI>mo,</HI> That every Heritor has a Right to have his Teinds declared free, rather than the Pro|perty of any Man; and that becau&s;e &s;everal legal Intere&s;ts ari&s;e to him thereby. 2<HI>do,</HI> Every Heritor has an Intere&s;t, that his Teinds &s;hould belong to the Crown, rather than to a Subject; the <HI>Exchequer</HI> being in u&s;e to grant Tacks to Heritors of their Teinds at a very ea&s;y Rate; and rather to belong to the Patron, from whom they can acquire at &s;ix Years Purcha&s;e, than to any other Titular, who can demand nine.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion comes preci&s;ely here, Whether the Alledgance made for the Defenders, amounted to a <HI>legal Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;uch a Benefit as it was unju&s;t to de|prive them of? That it is a <HI>legal Intere&s;t,</HI> the Court was of Opinion, 29th <HI>November</HI> 1710, <HI>Mitchel</HI> con|tra <HI>Baillie</HI> and <HI>Shearer,</HI> ob&s;erved by <HI>Forbes,</HI> where a Charter of Adjudication of the Teinds of certain Lands, with Infeftment thereon, was not found a &s;ufficient Title to oblige the Heritor of the Lands to make Payment of the Teinds, without producing the Adjudication it&s;elf, and in&s;tructing a Right to them in the Per&s;on of him they were adjudged from, albeit no other Right appeared to com|pete.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
A Va&s;&s;al being pur&s;ued by a Purcha&s;er of the Superiority, made this Defence, That the Seller's Relict was infeft as conjunct Fiar, and that he the Defender was bound to acknowledge none other for his Superior during her Lifetime; which was &s;u&s;tained <HI>Colvil.&mdash;May</HI> 1583, Laird of <HI>Capringtoun</HI> contra Laird of <HI>Caldwells.</HI> This Alledgance was not <HI>jus tertii;</HI> becau&s;e Va&s;&s;als have a legal Intere&s;t to keep their Charter-che&s;ts &s;hut again&s;t every one but their proper Superior.</P>
<P>Having thus given a general Idea of my Sub|ject, the Application thereof will be&s;t be &s;een by In|duction of particular Ca&s;es. Which, for Clearne&s;s Sake, I &s;hall range under different Heads.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="position">
<HEAD>POSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Debitor, pur&s;ued by an A&s;&s;igney, is founded in an Intere&s;t to alledge, that it appears</HI> ex facie &s;cripturae, <HI>or is otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;tent with his Know|ledge, that there is no Right in the A&s;&s;igney's Per&s;on, becau&s;e, in this Ca&s;e, he cannot pay &s;afe|ly. But if</HI> ex facie &s;cripturae, <HI>by the Production, it appear, that the A&s;&s;igney's Right is founded, the Debitor cannot be allowed to plead upon any Exception to take away the A&s;&s;igney's Right, un|le&s;s it be &s;o notorious, as nece&s;&s;arily to &s;uperinduce a</HI> mala fides. <HI>Such an Exception is</HI> jus tertii <HI>as to him, he has no Intere&s;t in it; all his Concern is to pay &s;afely, and he pays &s;afely when he pays to the Man who has the Face of a Title, e&s;pecially</HI> interpo&s;ita authoritate praetoris.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Branch of the Po&s;ition, &s;ee <HI>Durie March</HI> 5. 1624, <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI> contra <HI>Mackie&s;on.</HI> Here
<PB N="7" REF="10">
a Debitor being pur&s;ued by his Creditor upon a Bond, it was found competent for him to propone this Alledgance, That the Pur&s;uer's E&s;cheat was gifted, and the &s;pecial Declarator intimated to him the Debitor; which Declarator, though afterwards pa&s;&s;ed from as to him by the Donatar, was equiva|lent as if the Pur&s;uer had been denuded by an A&s;|&s;ignation intimate; and therefore he could not pay <HI>bona fide.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;econd Branch, &s;ee <HI>Durie,</HI> 21. <HI>Decem|ber</HI> 1621, <HI>Hamilton</HI> contra <HI>Durham;</HI> in which this Exception proponed by a Party in who&s;e Hands Arre&s;tment was laid, was repelled, as being <HI>jus tertii, &s;ciz.</HI> That the Arre&s;ter could not demand the Sum to be made furthcoming, in regard he had recovered Payment from the common De|bitor.</P>
<P><HI>James Ballantine</HI> took a Bond payable to him|&s;elf, and after his Decea&s;e to <HI><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Ballantine</HI> his Son; <HI>John Ballantine</HI>'s Name was afterwards filled up in this Bond, though he was born after the Date thereof; and he was found to have good Action as a Sub&s;titute again&s;t the Debitor, who had no Intere&s;t to debate how <HI>John</HI>'s Name came into the Bond, that being <HI>jus tertii,</HI> &s;eeing there was no other Heir or Child pretending Right. <HI>Stair, Dirleton,</HI> 5. <HI>January</HI> 1675. <HI>Ballantine</HI> con|tra <HI>Edgar.</HI></P>
<P>A Debitor objecting again&s;t the Donatary of his Creditors Forfeiture, That the Creditor him&s;elf was only an Executor, which, being an Office, could not be a&s;&s;igned, far le&s;s could be carried away by the Forfeiture, except as to the Executor's own Share; the Lords found this Alledgance <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the Debitor, and therefore repelled it. <HI>Fountain|hall</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
4<HI>th November</HI> 1686, <HI>Graham</HI> contra <HI>Lin.</HI> There may be &s;ome Doubt as to this Deci&s;ion. The Pur&s;uer here had not even a colourable Title. The Defect appeared <HI>ex facie &s;cripturae.</HI> It &s;eems incumbent upon a Defender to take Notice of &s;uch a Defect, and upon the Judge to &s;u&s;tain it for the Benefit of tho&s;e who &s;hall really be found to have the <HI>jus exigendi.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSITION II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>It is not</HI> jus tertii <HI>in a Defender to found upon the Right of a third Party, when the Intent is on|ly to make out, that he him&s;elf is not liable.</HI></P>
<P>In a Pur&s;uit for liquidating the Avail of a Mar|riage, it being alledged by the Donatary, That it was <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the apparent Heir to &s;ay, that his Father died not in the Fie, as being denuded by an Adjudger who was publickly infeft, unle&s;s that Adjudger would appear and defend; the Lords found, That it was not <HI>jus tertii,</HI> but com|petent to the apparent Heir to found upon it. <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> 13. <HI>February</HI> 1707, Lord <HI>Rae</HI> contra <HI>Innes.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="position">
<HEAD>POSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>When Payment is offered to a Creditor, it is</HI> jus ter|tii <HI>for him to object, that the Per&s;on is not en|titled to make the Offer; becau&s;e a Creditor is bound to accept of Payment from whatever Hand.</HI></P>
<P>A Party &s;erved and retoured Heir to a Defunct, offering to redeem an Adjudger, who alledged, that
<PB N="9" REF="12">
the Party to whom the Heir was retoured was pre|&s;umed alive, his Death not being in&s;tructed; the Lords found, That the Alledgance was <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the Adjudger, and &s;u&s;tained Proce&s;s at the Heir's In|&s;tance upon the Retour produced, in regard there was no nearer Heir quarrelling the &s;ame, 27. <HI>July</HI> 1688, <HI>Hay</HI> contra <HI>Dobbie.</HI> The Matter comes here, An Adjudication within the Legal, which was the Ca&s;e here, being only a Security for Debt, may be extingui&s;hed by whoever offers Payment. After Ex|piration of the Legal, when it becomes a Right of Property, the Adjudger is not bound to debate the Relevancy of Objections tending to annul his Right, or open the Legal, unle&s;s with a Per&s;on connecting a good Title to the Lands.</P>
<P>In the Redemption of a Wad&s;et by an Appri|&s;er of the Rever&s;ion, it was found <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the Wad&s;etter to alledge, the Appri&s;ing was fallen by Pre&s;cription. <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> 7. <HI>November</HI> 1704, <HI>Ni|col</HI> contra <HI>Park.</HI> Here the Pre&s;cription might have been interrupted, and it was not rea&s;onable to oblige the Appri&s;er to enter into this Di&s;pute with a Per|&s;on who had no other Intere&s;t but to get Payment. But this Matter is not without &s;ome &s;eeming Dif|ficulty; for if a Wad&s;et be con&s;idered only as a bare Security for Money, there does not a Rea&s;on occur why it &s;hould not be extingui&s;hable by any Per&s;on whatever offering Payment. If it be con&s;i|dered as a Right of Property in Lands, redeemable only by the Rever&s;er him&s;elf, and tho&s;e deriving Right from him by effectual Conveyances; upon that Suppo&s;ition the Wad&s;etter ought to be allow|ed to make every Objection again&s;t the Title of the Redeemer; and in my Opinion would be well
<PB N="10" REF="13">
founded in the Objection of Pre&s;cription mentioned in the Ca&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="position">
<HEAD>POSITION IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>It is not</HI> jus tertii <HI>in an apparent Heir to alledge, That the Pur&s;uer has no</HI> jus agendi, <HI>though the apparent Heir refu&s;es to acknowledge the pa&s;&s;ive Titles.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is, That regularly before the Defen|der is obliged to recur to any Defences, the Pur&s;uer mu&s;t &s;how, that he is founded in his Action; and unle&s;s he make out this Point, the Defender is not obliged to &s;ay whether he repre&s;ents or not, being founded in a legal Intere&s;t to keep this Matter pri|vate from every one, &s;ave the Defunct's ju&s;t Credi|tors. Thus then, an apparent Heir, without invol|ving him&s;elf in the pa&s;&s;ive Titles, may propone every Objection again&s;t the Pur&s;uer's Claim, that ari&s;es <HI>ex facie &s;cripturae,</HI> or that he can otherwi&s;e in&s;tant|ly verify. Objections indeed that require a Proof, &s;tand upon another Footing: Not that it is <HI>jus ter|tii</HI> in the Defender to propone them; the Rea&s;on why the apparent Heir, after proponing &s;uch Objec|tions, is not &s;uffered to deny the pa&s;&s;ive Titles, is al|lenarly the Hard&s;hip upon the Creditor, in obliging him to &s;u&s;tain a long Proof, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any Benefit to him, &s;o long as the Defender has in it his Power to deny the pa&s;&s;ive Titles.</P>

<HEAD>POSITION V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In a Competition betwixt two Rights to the &s;ame Subject, whereof the one, under which my Com|petitor claims, is in it &s;elf preferable, it is</HI> jus tertii <HI>for me to object, That his Progre&s;s is not well connected; which is only competent to one having a more compleat Progre&s;s to the &s;ame Right or Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>For Example, <HI>A</HI> has an ab&s;olute good Progre&s;s to the Infeftment <HI>X. B</HI> has but a lame Progre&s;s to the Infeftment <HI>Y.</HI> Yet <HI>B</HI> is preferred, <HI>Y</HI> being &s;uppo&s;ed the preferable Infeftment. And the Rea|&s;on is, It is ju&s;t to give <HI>B</HI> who has at lea&s;t a dou|bious Title, a Preference to <HI>A</HI> who can have no Pretence, as long as the Infeftment <HI>Y</HI> is in the Field. The re&s;pective <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> produced are ranked accord|ing to their legal Preference. And the Per&s;ons claim|ing upon the&s;e Intere&s;ts, if they have any Appea|rance of a connected Title, take their Places ac|cordingly. This being premi&s;ed, it is obvious, That <HI>A</HI> can have no <HI>legal Intere&s;t</HI> to impugn <HI>B</HI>'s Progre&s;s: For tho' it &s;hould be found, That <HI>C</HI> has Right to the Infeftment <HI>Y</HI> and not <HI>B,</HI> that does not benefit <HI>A,</HI> he can propo&s;e to him&s;elf no Ad|vantage by gaining the Point; becau&s;e in that Ca&s;e, the Judge would prefer <HI>C,</HI> and not <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>The Right of a Feu Va&s;&s;al being appri&s;ed from him, and the Appri&s;ing again di&s;pon'd to another, the Superior's Heir rai&s;ed Reduction and Improba|tion again&s;t the Di&s;ponee, and obtained Certifica|tion again&s;t the principal Sa&s;ine on the original Char|ter
<PB N="12" REF="15">
and again&s;t the Grounds and Warrants of the Appri&s;ing. Notwith&s;tanding of which, it was found <HI>jus tertii</HI> in the Pur&s;uer, to quarrel the Want of the&s;e Writs; in re&s;pect that, as Heir to the Gan|ter of the original Feu Charter, he was liable to warrant it. <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> 1 <HI>February</HI> 1712. Earl of <HI>Forfar</HI> contra <HI>Gilhaigie:</HI> Ob&s;erved al&s;o by Mr. <HI>Forbes,</HI> as of 31. <HI>January</HI> 1712. For the original Feu Charter, which was produced, being plainly preferable to the Pur&s;uer's Claim of Property, &s;ince he was debarred thereby, it was the &s;ame Thing to him, who was Va&s;&s;al; in that Que&s;tion he could have no legal Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In two mutual Declarators, touching the Right of a Salmond Fi&s;hing, the one produced a Charter from his Maje&s;ty, with a well connected Progre&s;s, down to the Time of the Competition; the other pro|duced a Right from a Subject of a much older Date, but not well connected, for many of the in|terveening Years; in &s;o much that his Progre&s;s, &s;o much of it as was well connected, did not go &s;o far back as his Competitor's. Yet it was found, That the Per&s;on deriving Right from his Maje&s;ty had no <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> to object the Want of Mid-couples to the other: And that it was <HI>jus tertii,</HI> and incom|petent for him to object and obtrude that Defect, unle&s;s he derived Right from the &s;ame Author, or any &s;ucceeding in his Right. <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> 3. <HI>De|cember</HI> 1701. <HI>Forbes</HI> of <HI>Watertoun</HI> contra <HI>Udney.</HI></P>

<P><HI>John Murray</HI> &s;erved him&s;elf Heir in general to <HI>Alexander Maxwel</HI> his Grandfather, and upon that Title did compeat with <HI>Neil&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chaple,</HI> who had Adjudications in his Per&s;on, led originally again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Alexander Maxwel,</HI> conveyed by the Cre|ditor to <HI>Eli&s;abeth Maxwel,</HI> and from her to the &s;aid <HI>Neil&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chaple.</HI> It was contended for <HI>John Mur|ray,</HI> That <HI>Eli&s;abeth Maxwel</HI> the intermediate Au|thor had di&s;poned the&s;e Appri&s;ings to her Husband <HI>Gilbert M'Cartney;</HI> and that therefore <HI>Neil&s;on</HI>'s Right was null, as granted <HI>a non habente pote&s;ta|tem.</HI> The Lords found it <HI>jus tertii,</HI> for <HI>John Mur|ray,</HI> to found upon the Right of <HI>Gilbert M'Cartney,</HI> unle&s;s he derived Right from him. This was found <HI>anno</HI> 1727. in the Competition <HI>Neil&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chaple</HI> and <HI>Lanerick</HI> of <HI>Ladylands,</HI> with <HI>John Murray.</HI> Here the Objection again&s;t <HI>Neil&s;on, viz.</HI> That his Author was denuded, and con&s;equently that he could have no Right, was in it &s;elf good: But then his Competitor was not allowed to found upon it, becau&s;e he could &s;hew no legal Intere&s;t therein. For what if <HI>Neil&s;on</HI>'s Right &s;hould be found null? That would &s;ignifie to <HI>M'Cartney</HI> indeed, if he plea&s;ed to

<P><HI>But as Law allows me to u&s;e every Argument tend|ing to annull or cut down the Title upon which my Competitor founds, when the Con&s;equence is to prefer my own Title, it is not</HI> Jus Tertii <HI>to found upon the Intere&s;t of a Third Party, when it tends to prove, not that the Third Party is preferable, which would be</HI> Jus Tertii, <HI>but that I my &s;elf am preferable by the Nullity of my Competitor's Right.</HI></P>
<P><HI>X</HI> is infeft in Lands. He gives a Di&s;po&s;ition con|taining Procuratory to <HI>A,</HI> who a&s;&s;igns, fir&s;t to <HI>B,</HI> and then to <HI>C;</HI> but <HI>C.</HI> is fir&s;t infeft. Betwixt the Dates of the&s;e two Infeftments, <HI>X</HI> grants a Second Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>D,</HI> who obtains him&s;elf infeft prior to <HI>B,</HI> but po&s;terior to <HI>C.</HI> Upon the Suppo&s;ition, <HI>That a per&s;onal Conveyance denudes of a per&s;onal Right,</HI> quaeritur, How is this Matter to be extricated? <HI>B</HI> is preferred to <HI>C</HI> upon the Footing of this Brocard, <HI>A</HI> being &s;uppo&s;ed entirely denuded by his fir&s;t A&s;&s;ig|nation in Favours of <HI>B. C</HI> is preferred to <HI>D,</HI> as fir&s;t infeft, and <HI>D</HI> to <HI>B,</HI> for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. And thus the Matter becomes plainly inextricable, unle&s;s <HI>D</HI> be allowed to plead that <HI>C</HI>'s Infeftment is null, as flowing <HI>a non habente pote&s;tatem,</HI> his Author <HI>A</HI> being <HI>ab ante</HI> denuded in Favours of <HI>B.</HI> The Dif|ficulty in this Ca&s;s is, That it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for <HI>D.</HI> to plead upon <HI>B</HI>'s A&s;&s;ignation. The An&s;wer is, That this very Example mu&s;t &s;how it not to be <HI>jus tertii;</HI> Since the Con&s;equence would plainly be to make the
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Affair inextricable, which is a downright Ab&s;urdi|ty. To take a general View of the Matter, it appears without Controver&s;y, that <HI>D</HI> is the Man who is fir&s;t legally infeft, and who has fir&s;t denuded the common Author <HI>X.</HI> Now if this be the plain Mat|ter of Fact, I can &s;ee no good Rea&s;on why <HI>D</HI> &s;hould not be allowed to found upon it. It is a Rule in our Law, that <HI>alii per alium acquiritur obligatio;</HI> the Principle upon which this is founded will equally &s;upport another Rule, that <HI>alii per alium acquiritur exceptio.</HI> And when we con&s;ider the Nature of this Objection of <HI>jus tertii,</HI> the Difficulty will evani&s;h; according to the Definition, it ari&s;es from pleading a Point, wherein the Party has no <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and the gaining of which cannot profit him. The direct contrary is the Ca&s;e here, for if <HI>C</HI>'s Infeftment be found null, <HI>D</HI> comes in of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To explain this Matter further, let us take a View of a Deci&s;ion ob&s;erved by <HI>Forbes</HI> 18th <HI>Dec.</HI> 1708. Colonel <HI>Erskine</HI> contra Sir <HI>George Hamilton;</HI> in which a Per&s;on having a real Right in Lands, was allowed to object again&s;t a competing Adjudi|cation, that it was null, as being led upon a Bond payed by the Debitor; albeit he who quarrelled the Adjudication, derived no Right from the Per&s;on a|gain&s;t whom it was led.</P>
<P>This Deci&s;ion is obviou&s;ly well founded; and yet therein we &s;ee a Party allowed, to found upon the Deed of a third Per&s;on with whom he does not con|nect, <HI>viz.</HI> the Payment made to his Competitor by the common Debitor. And he is allowed to do &s;o, for this preci&s;e Rea&s;on, that thereby he comes to e&s;tabli&s;h a Preference to him&s;elf. Now I can &s;ee no Difference betwixt this Deci&s;ion and the Ca&s;e in Hand. In both a Party is allowed to found upon
<PB N="16" REF="19">
the <HI>Deed</HI> of a third Per&s;on with whom he has no Connection; and in both he has equally a <HI>legal Be|nefit</HI> in &s;o doing. In a Word, there is nothing more common in Law than to &s;ee People founding upon the <HI>Deeds</HI> of third Parties; &s;uch Alledgances ca&s;t up in a thou&s;and Shapes every Day: If they can &s;hew no <HI>legal Intere&s;t</HI> in &s;o doing, it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> they are debarred <HI>per&s;onali objectione:</HI> If they can &s;how a legal Intere&s;t, they ought to be heard. This is al&s;o fortified by the Doctrine contained in Po&s;ition II. for if a Defender can found upon the Right of a third Party, in order to obtain <HI>ab&s;olvitor,</HI> for the fame Rea&s;on may a Competitor found upon the Right of a third Party to obtain <HI>Preference.</HI></P>
<P>Another Ca&s;e is related by Lord <HI>Stair</HI> 22d <HI>July</HI> 1668. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> contra <HI>Arnold,</HI> to this Purpo&s;e; In a Competition betwixt two Appri&s;ings, whereupon Infeftment had followed, both led before the Act bringing in Appri&s;ers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u;</HI> The fir&s;t Appri&s;er was al&s;o fir&s;t infeft: But it was objected again&s;t the Infeftment by the &s;econd Appri&s;er, that it was null, being in Name of an A&s;&s;igney to the Appri&s;ing, who did not appear to have any Right, no A&s;&s;ignation being produced. This the Lords fu&s;tained, and did not find it <HI>jus tertii</HI> to object the Want of the &s;aid A&s;&s;ignation.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> The Competition run betwixt the &s;econd Appri&s;er and the Heir of the fir&s;t Appri&s;er, who had al&s;o in his Per&s;on a Conveyance from the A&s;&s;igney, in who&s;e Name Infeftment was taken.</P>

<P><HI>Where an Alledgance tends not to make my Party's Title ab&s;olute ly null, but only reduceable or annul|lable at the In&s;tance of a third Party, it is jus ter|tii for me to found upon it.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, a Donatar of Ward and Non-en|try pur&s;uing the Va&s;&s;al for the Non-entry Duties fallen due &s;everal Years after elap&s;ing of the Ward; this Gift of Non-entry continues but three Terms after the Ward in Competition with the King or another Donatar, but is &s;till good again&s;t the Va&s;|&s;al; and therefore it is reckoned <HI>jus tertii</HI> for him to found upon it. <HI>Haddington,</HI> 6th <HI>July</HI> 1611. <HI>Dick|&s;on</HI> contra Laird <HI>Dawick;</HI> A Spuilie was &s;u&s;tained, altho' at committing the &s;ame the Party injured was at the Horn, it being found <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the Defen|der, to alledge, that the Action in that Ca&s;e was competent only to the King and his Donatat. <HI>Mait|land,</HI> 16th <HI>June</HI> 1552, Laird <HI>Kinfauns</HI> contra Laird <HI>Craigie.</HI> The Rea&s;on is, That Denunciation does not <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> dive&s;t the Rebel of his Moveables; he re|mains &s;till Proprietor until the King plea&s;es to take the Benefit of his Rebellion. And therefore the Deci&s;ion would probably have gone otherwi&s;e, if the Defender could have &s;ub&s;umed upon a general or &s;pecial De|clarator at the Donatar's In&s;tance. In a Proce&s;s at a Mini&s;ter's In&s;tance for his Stipend, it was objected by the Heritors, that he was not duely admitted by a Pre&s;entation conform to the Statute 10. <HI>Annae</HI> re|re&s;toring Patronages; this was found <HI>jus tertii</HI> to the Heritors, being competent only to the Patron him&s;elf. <HI>Forbes</HI> 18th <HI>June</HI> 1714, <HI>M'Bain</HI> contra

<P>It may be worth Notice, that this Po&s;ition does not &s;o directly come under the Doctrine of <HI>jus tertii.</HI> In the Deci&s;ions ju&s;t now mentioned, the Alledgean|ces were repelled, not &s;o much upon the Footing of a <HI>jus tertii,</HI> that the Proponer had no Intere&s;t to make them; but truly becau&s;e they were by no Means con|clu&s;ive, did not infer what they were brought to prove, which above all is plain from the la&s;t menti|oned Deci&s;ion, in which there was not wanting a <HI>legal Intere&s;t</HI> to found the Proponer in his Alledg|ance of Nullity; he failed only in this, That it was not found to be a Nullity: There is a wide Diffe|rence betwixt a <HI>null</HI> Right, and a Right <HI>annullable;</HI> a Nullity in a <HI>Right</HI> may be pled upon by every one who can &s;how an Intere&s;t in the Que&s;tion; the Pow|er of annulling, by no Mortal, but who is ve&s;ted with the Power.</P>

<HEAD>Beneficium cedendarum actionum.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen a Creditor has different Per&s;ons or Subjects bound to him for Secu|rity and Payment of his Debt, it naturally ari&s;es to be a Que&s;tion, how far he has it in his Power to exerce his Right arbitrarily, by loading one and freeing another; and when he does &s;o, if there is any Relief competent to the Per&s;on or Subject over-burdened. Que&s;tions of this Nature may be ea&s;ily &s;olvable in the &s;imple Ca&s;es. But the Connections betwixt Per&s;ons and Subjects, Creditors and Debitors, preferable and &s;econdary Securities, ca&s;t up &s;o various and intricate, and run out &s;o great a Length, that one is apt to lo&s;e him&s;elf, if he does not begin at Principles, and go on Step by Step from the more ea&s;y to the more intricate Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It appears in the fir&s;t Place agreeable to Principles of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Humanity,</HI> that Creditors having bound to them different Per&s;ons or their Effects, &s;hould not be allowed ARBITRARILY to load one and exempt others. There are two good Rea&s;ons for this, one <HI>a priori,</HI> the other <HI>a po&s;teriori.</HI> The
<PB N="20" REF="23">
one <HI>a priori</HI> is drawn from this Law of Nature, <HI>That every Man is confined in the Way of u&s;ing his Pro|perty &s;o as to be lea&s;t hurtful to others.</HI> He is allow|ed to prefer him&s;elf; but his own Intere&s;t being out of the Que&s;tion, he has no longer Liberty to go on to take any Step <HI>in aemulationem vicini,</HI> either by direct|ly doing Damage, or by u&s;ing the Pretext of his Pro|perty <HI>arbitrarily</HI> to prejudge one for the Benefit of a|nother. To take this in &s;omewhat a different Light, <HI>Property</HI> was introduced, not that Men &s;hould be indulged to u&s;e it wantonly, but only in &s;o far as beneficial to them&s;elves. Therefore every Man may u&s;e his Property while his private Intere&s;t goes along. There his <HI>Power</HI> is at an End. After that the Law takes it out of his Hands, and directs it &s;o as in the whole to do mo&s;t Good to others. And when the Matter is brought there, it is plain, that the Law, which is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons, never acts <HI>arbitra|rily,</HI> but deals to every one with an equal Hand. The Con&s;ideration <HI>a po&s;teriori</HI> is drawn from the numberle&s;s Inconveniencies that might en&s;ue if Cre|ditors were indulged in this arbitrary Proceeding: It would naturally introduce underhand fraudulent Pac|tions betwixt the Creditor, who holds the Ballance, and &s;ome one or other of the Debitors, in order to throw the Burden upon others. Every one would endeavour to bribe highe&s;t to get him&s;elf relieved. And thus Bribery and Corruption would go on to the De&s;truction of Debitors, whereby their Creditors would have an Opportunity of making unju&s;t Gains by Extortion, which no civilized Country will indulge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Law and ours go thus far Hand in Hand, that a Debitor paying, is entitled to demand A&s;&s;ignation from the Creditor again&s;t his Fellow Debitor, <HI>l.</HI> 17. <HI>l.</HI> 36. <HI>Fideju&s;&s;.</HI> Here the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="24">
Law &s;tops, at lea&s;t that of the <HI>Pandects,</HI> and gives no Action for Relief to one Co-debitor again&s;t ano|ther, where the Action is not ceded, <HI>l.</HI> 39. <HI>Fideju&s;&s;.</HI> This is better ordered in our Law; with us the De|bitor who pays, has directly an Action for a propor|tionable Relief again&s;t his Co-debitor without Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of A&s;&s;ignation. This is not under&s;tood to pro|ceed from any Paction expre&s;t or implied betwixt the <HI>correi debendi.</HI> It flows directly from the above Principle, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> That a Creditor is confined from ex|ercing his Right <HI>arbitrarily.</HI> He ought to draw a proportional Part from every one of his Debitors, or if for his own Ea&s;e he chu&s;es to draw the whole from one, it is incumbent upon him to a&s;&s;ign his Debt and Diligence, that the Per&s;on making Pay|ment may have a proportional Relief off others; and becau&s;e it is a Rule, <HI>That what ought always to be done, is ever held as done,</HI> the Law, to abridge the unnece&s;&s;ary Circuit of an A&s;&s;ignation, gives directly an Action of Relief to the Debitor making Payment again&s;t his Fellow Debitors, whether he has an A&s;|&s;ignation or not. This &s;eems to have been the Law of the <HI>Codex, l.</HI> 2. <HI>C. de duob. reis,</HI> and this is our common Practice at this Day.</P>
<P>Thus the Matter is fix'd upon the mo&s;t &s;olid and equitable Footing, &s;o far as relates to <HI>per&s;onal Re|lief</HI> among&s;t Fellow-debitors; It mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that our Practice is but in its Infancy as to <HI>real Relief,</HI> that ought to be competent to the Proprietor or &s;econdary Creditor, out of who&s;e Fund Payment is drawn again&s;t the other Funds, upon which the preferable Debt is equally &s;ecured. To give the plaine&s;t Example, Two Per&s;ons <HI>conjunctly and &s;everally</HI> oblige them&s;elves to pay a Sum, and grant each of them an heritable Bond out of their
<PB N="22" REF="25">
re&s;pective Lands, upon which Infeftment follows. So far the Matter is clear by our Practice, that the Debitor, out of who&s;e E&s;tate the whole Sum is made effectual by virtue of the Infeftment of An|nualrent, has per&s;onal Relief off his Fellow-debitor; But why not al&s;o real Relief? That is, why &s;hould he not be intitled to take up the Creditor's Infeft|ment upon the other Debitor's Lands, in order to be ranked for that Part of the Sum, which he has paid over and above his Proportion? It appears, without Controver&s;y, that there is the &s;ame Foun|dation for both. It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, That after the Debt is paid out of one Debitor's Effects, the Bond falls extingui&s;h'd with all its Con&s;equences. But in An&s;wer to this it is urg'd, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the Debitor him&s;elf or his real Creditors to plead upon this, &s;ince in all Events no more is intended to be drawn from him than his Proportion of the Debt. 2<HI>do &amp; principaliter,</HI> At any Rate this might have been done by the Circuit of an A&s;&s;ignation: Now, as is above laid down, the Law &s;upplies this, and grants an implied A&s;|&s;ignation. For truly the Action for Relief betwixt Co-debitors, whether per&s;onal or real, is no other than an Action upon an implied <HI>legal</HI> A&s;&s;ignation. The Matter then comes out thus; From each of the Debitors the Creditor has &s;trictly Right to demand Payment of the one Half; if he chu&s;e to poind the Ground of one of the Debitors for the whole, which he may do for his own Conveniency; the Law &s;uppo&s;es, that he takes the one Half in Pay|ment of that Debitor's Proportion of the Debt; but as for the other Half, that is not &s;uppo&s;ed taken in Payment of a Debt, which the other Debitor is ultimately liable in, but as the Price of the legal
<PB N="23" REF="26">
A&s;&s;ignation; &s;ee <HI>l.</HI> 36. <HI>Fideju&s;.</HI> And therefore the Creditor's Infeftment remains &s;till good upon the other Debitor's Lands as to that Half, which may accordingly be taken up in virtue of the <HI>legal</HI> A&s;|&s;ignation, by the Debitor, who has paid the whole. The Benefit of this <HI>legal</HI> A&s;&s;ignation would be of con&s;iderable Effect in Practice. Among&s;t others it would remove the Pretext that Debitors have to &s;u&s;pend real Diligence, in order to obtain an actual A&s;&s;ignation.</P>
<P>'Tis true, no Traces appear in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law of this real Relief, otherwi&s;e than by the Circuit of an A&s;&s;ignation: With re&s;pect to which there is a remarkable Text, <HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>Pr. de Cen&s;.</HI> But neither were they acquainted with the per&s;onal Relief, at lea&s;t by the ancient Law: However, as the Foun|dation of real Relief is plainly laid down in the &s;aid <HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>de Cen&s;.</HI> it would be no great Stretch to e&s;tabli&s;h it, even in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, by an Ar|gument drawn from the &s;aid <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>C. de duob. reis.</HI></P>
<P>The Principle being thus fix'd, it will be ea&s;y to draw out a Rule for adju&s;ting all the Kinds of <HI>real</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal Relief</HI> among&s;t Co-debitors and &s;e|condary Creditors. A Creditor, who has &s;everal Per&s;ons bound to him in a Debt, is &s;uppo&s;ed to take Payment equally and proportionally from every one of them. If he choo&s;es to draw more from any one than his Proportion, this is not under&s;tood as taken in Payment, but as the Price of an A&s;&s;igna|tion <HI>actual</HI> or <HI>legal.</HI> This intitles the Payer to come in Place of the Creditor as to that Superplus, which accordingly he may draw from the other Debitors. After the very &s;ame Manner, when a Catholick Creditor, who&s;e Infeftment reaches over two Tene|ments, draws the whole out of one, the Per&s;on
<PB N="24" REF="27">
overburdened, whether Proprietor, or only a &s;e|condary Creditor, ought to be intitled to act in the Creditor's Name to be refunded of the Superplus over and above his Proportion out of the other Te|nement; whereby <HI>Equality</HI> is pre&s;erved among&s;t all concerned, and no <HI>Per&s;on</HI> or <HI>Subject</HI> bears a greater or le&s;s Burden than his Situation obliges him to. And thus the Rule comes out, THAT REAL OR PERSONAL RELIEF GOES NO FURTHER THAN TO BE REFUNDED OF WHAT THE SUBJECT OR PER|SON HAS BEEN BURDENED WITH OVER AND ABOVE HIS PROPORTION.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now come to Particulars; and for Me|thod's Sake, it may be proper, 1<HI>mo,</HI> To handle &s;uch Ca&s;es as fall directly under the Rule. 2<HI>do,</HI> The&s;e Ca&s;es, which, by Rea&s;on of &s;pecial Circum|&s;tances, may be ranked under the Head of Excep|tions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Suppo&s;ing a preferable Infeftment upon the Tenements</HI> A. <HI>and</HI> B. <HI>both pertaining to the common Debi|tor, and a &s;econdary Infeftment upon</HI> A. <HI>only, the &s;econdary Creditor infeft in the Tenement</HI> A. <HI>out of which Tenement the Catholick Creditor chu&s;es to draw his whole Debt, is intitled only to a pro|portional Relief out of the Tenement</HI> B. <HI>tho' there be no other Infeftment upon it, &s;ave that belong|ing to the Catholick Creditor.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>This is a direct Inference from the Rule above laid down. The Catholick Creditor is &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>fictione juris,</HI> to draw proportionally out of the two Tenements; And if in Fact he does otherwi&s;e, the
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Creditor overburdened has Relief indeed, but only &s;o far as he is overburdened. As to a total A&s;|&s;ignation again&s;t the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> it appears obvious, that the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> is no better intitled to it than any of the per&s;onal Creditors of the common Debitor. If the Fact be, That he has lent more Money upon the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> than that Portion of it will &s;atisfy, which remains after a pro|portional Allocation of the catholick Right, he has him&s;elf to blame. Upon that Suppo&s;ition, nothing remains to him, but in common with the per&s;onal Creditors to attack that Portion of the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> which remains after the &s;aid proportional Allo|cation.</P>
<P>To take this Matter a little more at large, let us examine what mu&s;t be the Con&s;equences of a Scheme, where it is held, that the &s;econdary Credi|tor upon <HI>A</HI> is intitled to demand a total A&s;&s;igna|tion for his Relief again&s;t the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> in ca&s;e there is no other Burden upon it be&s;ide the catho|lick Infeftment. Upon this Scheme it is not &s;een, that any Creditor can well excu&s;e him&s;elf for lend|ing upon the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> when there is a &s;econda|ry Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> and a catholick Creditor over both; for this would be truly defrauding the &s;econ|dary Creditor of his Security. If it be alledged, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> when he lent his Money took his Hazard of this, it is an|&s;wered, This is no Excu&s;e to any Party who offici|ou&s;ly cuts him out of his Hazard, by turning it into a Certainty again&s;t him. If it be &s;aid, 2<HI>do,</HI> That the Creditor contracting upon <HI>B,</HI> was not bound to know of the Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> the An&s;wer is, That at any Rate no Creditor is &s;afe to lend upon <HI>B,</HI> without knowing whether there is a &s;econ|dary
<PB N="26" REF="29">

If it be &s;aid, 3<HI>tio,</HI> That the Creditor up|on <HI>B,</HI> does no more than any Creditor does, who lends upon heritable Security, knowing his Debitor to have per&s;onal Creditors. The Difference is, that the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> (upon the pre&s;ent Suppo&s;ition) is under&s;tood to be a Security to the Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> by his Right to demand A&s;&s;ignation preferable to all other Creditors; which Security the Creditor up|on <HI>B</HI> in Part cuts him out of. Now per&s;onal Cre|ditors have no Security upon their Debitors Lands; they may effect it by Diligence; but &s;o may they the Money come in its Place. From all which it appears, that if it be a lawful Commerce for a Creditor to lend upon <HI>B,</HI> while there is another &s;econdary Cre|ditor upon <HI>A,</HI> and a catholick Creditor over both, which cannot be di&s;puted, it mu&s;t follow, that the Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> has but a proportional Relief off the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> even when there is no Burden up|on <HI>B,</HI> &s;ave that of the catholick Creditor's.</P>

<P>It is laid down in the Propo&s;ition, that the &s;econ|dary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> is <HI>entitled</HI> only to a propor|tional Relief out of the Tenement <HI>B.</HI> Now this he can demand of <HI>Right,</HI> and can by no Alteration of Circum&s;tances be cut out off.

<P>'Tis very true, that in this Situation the catho|lick preferable Creditor has it in his Power to <HI>fa|vour</HI> either the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> or the per&s;onal Creditors who have not attached either of the Subjects. If he deny an A&s;&s;ignation, all that remains for the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> after adju&s;ting the proportional Relief, is to adjudge the Tenement <HI>B, pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the per&s;onal Creditors, which will entitle him to a Share of what remains of the Tenement <HI>B</HI> unexhau&s;ted, after the propor|tional Relief. If on the other Hand, the catholick Creditor vouchafe to grant A&s;&s;ignation, the per&s;o|nal Creditors have no Acce&s;s, unle&s;s the two Tene|ments do more than &s;atisfy both the real Debts.

<PB N="28" REF="31">
<HI>B,</HI> having not &s;o much as the Pretence of lending their Money upon the Faith of it, are founded in no Title to oppo&s;e a total A&s;&s;ignation. The catholick Creditor is not &s;o much as bound to know, that there are any per&s;onal Creditors, and has no Cou|nection or Concern with them. When therefore in the&s;e Circum&s;tances the catholick Creditor chu&s;es to <HI>favour</HI> the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A,</HI> by granting him a total A&s;&s;ignation; this is not <HI>cutting down,</HI> or <HI>hurting</HI> one Creditor in favours of another, &s;ince the per&s;onal Creditors have no <HI>Nexus</HI> upon the Te|nement <HI>B;</HI> 'tis at mo&s;t but di&s;appointing them of a Hope, which may be <HI>lucrum ce&s;&s;ans,</HI> but is by no Means <HI>damnum datum.</HI> 'Tis another Ca&s;e if the per&s;onal Creditors have by Diligence attached the Tenement <HI>B.</HI> 'Tis thought that even a bare Citation in an Adjudication is a &s;ufficient <HI>Nexus</HI> upon the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> to enforce a proportional Relief be|twixt them and the &s;econdary real Creditor upon <HI>A.</HI> For after Citation, it is no longer a Matter of <HI>Favour,</HI> but of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Equity.</HI></P>
<P>Yet after all, if there's any Appearance, that a total A&s;&s;ignation is the Re&s;ult of a Contrivance betwixt the two real Creditors, to di&s;appoint the per&s;onal Creditors, 'tis left to be con&s;idered, if, up|on that Suppo&s;ition, the A&s;&s;ignation might not be cut down upon the Head of <HI>Collu&s;ion:</HI> And there would be the more Ground for this, if &s;uch A&s;|&s;ignation were granted after nottour Bankruptcy, which indeed would be very &s;u&s;picious.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>This is plain from <HI>Prop.</HI> 4th and 5th. It will be proper here to obviate a Scruple that ari&s;es with Re&s;pect to this Propo&s;ition. Let us put the Argu|ment in the Mouth of a per&s;onal Creditor, who may urge it as a hard Ca&s;e, the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> lying open for him to adjudge, whereby he would have the Benefit of a proportional Allocation, if the Law &s;hould cut him out, by &s;uffering the Catholick Cre|ditor to renounce in Favours of the &s;econdary Cre|ditor upon <HI>A.</HI> The &s;ame, &s;ays he, indeed happens, if the Catholick Creditor purcha&s;es in the &s;econdary Debt upon <HI>A,</HI> or a&s;&s;igns his Right to that &s;econ|dary Creditor; but this mu&s;t be allowed for the Sake of Commerce, that Creditors be not debarr'd from taking Money for their Claims. In An&s;wer to this, it is allowed, that if the Renunciation can be proven the Re&s;ult of a Contrivance to di&s;appoint the per&s;onal Creditors, I know not if this might not be under&s;tood as collu&s;ive, and which mu&s;t always be under&s;tood, if the Renunciation be after notour Bankruptcy; but otherwi&s;e Renunciation may be as nece&s;&s;ary for Commerce as either of the other two Ca&s;es. For put the Ca&s;e, the &s;econdary Creditor
<PB N="34" REF="37">
upon <HI>A</HI> refu&s;es to tru&s;t his Money any longer in the common Debitor's Hands, unle&s;s he get an ad|ditional Security upon <HI>B,</HI> or a Renunciation from the Catholick Creditor, if the la&s;t be cho&s;en, as more ea&s;ily expedited, 'tis obvious the per&s;onal Creditors have nothing to complain of. See what is further &s;aid <HI>Schol. Prop.</HI> 1<HI>&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e four la&s;t Propo&s;itions are plainly in Prin|ciples; but there may be &s;ome Di&s;pute in the Exe|cution. For they &s;uppo&s;e, that before the Catho|lick Creditor can renounce the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> or lend upon it, or purcha&s;e in a Debt already contracted, he mu&s;t &s;earch the Regi&s;ters, lea&s;t there be a Debt already contracted upon <HI>B;</HI> if he lends or purcha&s;es in, no Que&s;tion it is <HI>cum priculo.</HI> As for renoun|cing, he may do it &s;afely; but the Creditor, in who&s;e Favours the Renunciation is made, is by no Means in Safety to rely upon it without knowing what Burdens are upon the other Tenements &s;ub|jected to the Catholick Infeftment. Another In|convenience is, That there's no ab&s;olute Certainty of coming to the Knowledge what Renunciations have been granted. For if even the Declaration of the Catholick Creditor &s;hould be thought a &s;ufficient Security, tho' that is not always ea&s;y to be obtain|ed, yet frequently the Debt &s;tands in the Per&s;on of a &s;ingular or univer&s;al Succe&s;&s;or. To remedy the&s;e Inconveniencies, it might be proper by an Act of <HI>Sederunt</HI> to appoint, 1<HI>mo,</HI> Secondary Creditors, when they contract, to intimate their Rights to the Catholick Creditor; under this Certification, That otherwi&s;e the Catholick Creditor &s;hall be at Li|berty to contract, acquire or renounce, as if &s;uch &s;econdary Debt were not exi&s;ting. 2<HI>do,</HI> To ap|point Renunciations to be regi&s;tred, which will give
<PB N="35" REF="38">
ab&s;olute Security to contract upon Tenements where|upon there is already a preferable Catholick Infeft|ment. We will &s;ee from Deci&s;ions to be mention|ed hereafter, how far this is under&s;tood to be nece&s;|&s;ary; and how far already fix'd.</P>
<P>To conclude this Head, it often happens to be doubtful after what Manner this proportional Allo|cation of the preferable Creditor's Right is to be ex|tricated, by Rea&s;on of the peculiar Nature thereof, or of the Rights of the &s;econdary Creditors. To give an In&s;tance.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e three Adjudgers, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> a Catho|lick Adjudger of both Tenements; 2<HI>do,</HI> An Ad|judger coming in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> upon the Tenement <HI>A.</HI> 3<HI>tio,</HI> An Adjudger without Year and Day upon the Tenement <HI>B.</HI> The Difficulty in this Ca&s;e is, That the Catholick Adjudger is not &s;imply preferable to the other two Adjudgers, as in the ordinary Ca&s;es. But it may be reduced to the &s;imple&s;t Ca&s;e thus. Let the Tenement <HI>A</HI> be &s;uppo&s;ed divided betwixt the two Adjudgers in Proportion to their re&s;pective Debts. This becau&s;e they come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u.</HI> Lay a&s;ide altogether that Proportion of the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> which befalls the Creditor who comes in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the Catholick Adjudger upon that Tenement. This pays his Debt <HI>pro tanto;</HI> and as for the Re|mainder, it comes in as a &s;econdary Debt upon that Proportion of the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> which falls to the Share of the Catholick Creditor. The Ca&s;e then reduced to its &s;imple&s;t Terms &s;tands thus. A Ca|tholick Right over a certain Proportion of the Te|nement <HI>A,</HI> which we &s;hall call <HI>D,</HI> and al&s;o over the whole Tenement <HI>B.</HI> A &s;econdary Right over <HI>B, &s;ciz.</HI> the Adjudication without Year and Day; a &s;econdary Right over <HI>D, &s;ciz.</HI> the Remainder of
<PB N="36" REF="39">
the other Adjudger's Claim, over and above what his Share of the Tenement <HI>A</HI> comes to: And when the Que&s;tion is reduced to the&s;e Terms, the Rules for the proportional Allocation are ea&s;ily appli|cable.</P>
<P>Let each of the Debts be 6, and each of the Te|nements worth 6. In the fir&s;t Place, lay a&s;ide 3, as a <HI>praecipuum</HI> to the &s;econd Adjudger upon <HI>A.</HI> This being done, we have a catholick Creditor over the Tenement <HI>D</HI> = 3, and of the Tenement <HI>B</HI> = 6. Out of the&s;e two Tenements, he ought to draw his Sum proportionally; that is 2 out of <HI>D</HI> and 4 out of <HI>B.</HI> (2 being to 4 as 3 to 6) after which there remains 2 to the Creditor upon <HI>B,</HI> 1 to the Creditor upon <HI>A.</HI> So upon the whole, the catholick Adjudger draws his 6, the Adjudger coming in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with him upon the Tenement <HI>A</HI> draws 4, and the other Ad|judger upon <HI>B.</HI> only 2.</P>
<P>Let us vary this Ca&s;e a little, and &s;uppo&s;e all the three adjudges within Year and Day, and let the Numbers be the &s;ame, &s;ave only, that the Adjudger upon <HI>B,</HI> is only 3. Here &s;triking out the &s;econd and third Adjudgers Claims, &s;o far as they come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the catholick Adjudger, there will remain two Subjects, 3 which remains of <HI>A,</HI> 4 which remains of <HI>B,</HI> over which the catholick Adjudger is preferable, and out which he is to draw his Debt 6 proportionally. Which is 2 4/7 out of 3, and 3 3/7 out of 4. So that the catholick Ad|judger draws his whole 6. The Adjudger upon <HI>A</HI> draws 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/7 the Adjudger upon <HI>B</HI> 2 4/7.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e the Legals to be expired, and &s;ee what Alteration that makes. Here the Ad|judications, that before were Rights in Security, li|mited to the Payment of the Debt &s;ecured, become
<PB N="37" REF="40">
now Rights of Property. Thus then in the fir&s;t of the two Ca&s;es, the catholick Adjudger now no longer re&s;tricted to his Claim of 6; in the Divi&s;ion of the Property with the other Adjudgers, claims the Half of the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> and the whole Te|nement <HI>B.</HI> And in the other Ca&s;e, he draws the Half of the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> and 4/6 of the Tene|ment <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>To give another In&s;tance, where the Application of this Rule may &s;eem to be attended with &s;ome Difficulty. The Ca&s;e is; after an Inhibition, the Debitor grants a per&s;onal Bond to one, and alienates a Parcel of Land to another; the Inhibiter attacks the Purcha&s;er, Is he bound to a&s;&s;ign <HI>in totum?</HI> The Difficulty is, That here there appears no Place for a proportional Allocation, there not being two Funds, out of which the Debt &s;ecured by Inhi|bition may be drawn. The An&s;wer is, That the per&s;onal Bond granted after Inhibition mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as one Fund, at lea&s;t &s;o much of it as comes to be made effectual again&s;t the bankrupt E&s;tate by Adjudication, and the Lands di&s;poned as another. And therefore, that tho' the Inhibiter may a&s;&s;ign <HI>in totum,</HI> yet the A&s;&s;igny cannot u&s;e it, but propor|tionally again&s;t the per&s;onal Creditor adjudging. But if the A&s;&s;ignation to the Purcha&s;er is &s;uppo&s;ed prior in Date, to the Adjudication upon the per|&s;onal Bond, there the A&s;&s;ignation may be u&s;ed <HI>in totum, per</HI> Corrol. Prop. IV. Simular to this is Di|ligence by Horning again&s;t a Bankrupt, which is made u&s;e of to found a Reduction, upon the Act 1621. In this Ca&s;e the Creditor reducing is bound to a&s;&s;ign his Debt and Diligence, but then the A&s;|&s;igny cannot extend it again&s;t other Alienations, made prior to the A&s;&s;ignation, otherwi&s;e than pro|portionally;
<PB N="38" REF="41">
but as to Alienations made after, he may extend it <HI>in totum.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now touch &s;ome of the <HI>Exceptions,</HI> where this proportional Relief is denied, upon &s;pecial Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It will be remembred, as laid down in the Be|ginning of this E&s;&s;ay, That the proportional Allo|cation and Relief obtains, when &s;everal Per&s;ons or &s;everal Subjects are bound equally to the &s;ame Creditor; the Inequality of the Obligation will, in all Ca&s;es, di&s;turb this Rule. As for Example, where one Per&s;on or Thing is bound principally, an other only <HI>in &s;ub&s;idium.</HI></P>
<P>As to Ca&s;es of this Kind, take the following Rule.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION VII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>When two Per&s;ons or Subjects are bound unequally, the one principally, the other</HI> in &s;ub&s;idium, <HI>the proportional Allocation cannot obtain. But the &s;ub&s;idiary Obligant is intitled to a total A&s;&s;igna|tion again&s;t the Principal, and has a total Re|lief.</HI></P>
<P>This naturally follows from the Doctrine above laid down; for if an Equality of Obligation infer a proportional A&s;&s;ignation or Relief, an Inequality of Obligation mu&s;t infer a di&s;proportional A&s;&s;igna|tion or Relief: And thus it is founded in the ge|neral Principle, that Cautioners, who have renounced the Benefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, have yet the Benefit <HI>Cedendarum actionum.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of the &s;trict Cautionry Oblige|ment, the Intendment of which is, that the Cau|tioner &s;hall pay, if the Principal be in&s;olvent, and
<PB N="39" REF="42">
which therefore infers the Benefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; here it is obvious, that there is no proportional Re|liet betwixt the Principal and Cautioner. After the principal Debitor is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the Creditor at|tacking the Cautioner, is bound to a&s;&s;ign his Debt and Diligence, that the Cautioner may make the be&s;t of them. Ab&s;tracting from the Principles above laid down, this is otherwi&s;e plain from the follow|ing Con&s;ideration, that as the principal Debitor is liable ultimately for the Debt, the Diligence ought to be kept up, in order to attack any future Funds accruing to him. And &s;ince the Creditor is out of the Que&s;tion, by the Cautioner's making Payment, the Diligence ought to &s;tand in the Cautioner's Per|&s;on. The Obligation to a&s;&s;ign being thus founded in the Nature of the Cautionry Contract, it follows, that the Creditor may not with-hold it upon a Pre|text, as if no Man were bound to a&s;&s;ign again&s;t him|&s;elf. For 'tis obvious the principal Debitor is not &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;t, &s;o long as the Creditor retains to him&s;elf Securities for his &s;eparate Debt, upon Subjects belonging to the principal Debitor. It makes no Objection what was found, <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>C. Fide|ju&s;&s;.</HI> becau&s;e, at the Time of this Law, <HI>Fideju&s;&s;ores</HI> had not the <HI>beneficium ordinis aut di&s;cu&s;&s;ionis,</HI> be|ing introduced afterwards by <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> &s;ee <HI>Nov.</HI> 4. <HI>C.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>In this Matter a Que&s;tion may ari&s;e, relating indeed principally to the Nature of an Inhibition. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a Man lends Money upon a per&s;onal Bond and inhibits the Debitor; thereafter he lends another Sum to him &s;ecured by Infeftment. La&s;t of all the Debitor grants a Bond of Corroboration of the per&s;onal Debt with a Cautioner. When the Cautioner pays, without Controver&s;y he has a Right
<PB N="40" REF="43">
to the Inhibition. Upon this the Que&s;tion ari&s;es, Whether the Inhibition a&s;&s;ign'd to the Cautioner does &s;trike again&s;t the Creditor's heritable Bond? Which re&s;olves into a Di&s;pute anent the Nature of an Inhibition, whether it be <HI>real,</HI> that is, directed to the Debt, and intended to guard it, or only <HI>per|&s;onal,</HI> directed to the Creditor; that is, in other Words, whether Inhibition be a Prohibition to the Debitor to alienate in Prejudice of the <HI>Debt,</HI> or in Pre|judice of the <HI>Creditor?</HI> I incline to the la&s;t. Upon which Suppo&s;ition, the Inhibition, when a&s;&s;ign'd, will not be available to the Cautioner, &s;ince it does not &s;trike again&s;t Alienations made to the Creditor him&s;elf. 'Tis a different Ca&s;e, if the Cautionry Obligement was prior to the contracting of the heritable Debt; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>Let us, in the next Place, &s;uppo&s;e a Cautioner, who has renounced the Benefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by binding him&s;elf <HI>conjunctly and &s;everally</HI> with the Principal. And here, tho' the Cautioner is <HI>directly,</HI> yet not <HI>equally</HI> bound with the Principal. There|fore, by <HI>Prop.</HI> VII. as he has a total Relief, he ought to have a total A&s;&s;ignation. But if once we e&s;tabli&s;h the Obligation upon the Creditor to a&s;&s;ign, it will follow by <HI>Prop.</HI> V. That he cannot there|after contract with the principal Debitor directly or indirectly, to di&s;appoint the Cautioner's Relief. But there appears nothing to oblige the Creditor to a&s;&s;ign again&s;t him&s;elf, to defeat any Right of his own, that was prior to the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Cau|tioner. For &s;ince, in this Ca&s;e, the Cautioner has not the Benefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he has nothing to found his Claim of A&s;&s;ignation upon, but the ge|neral Laws above laid down; and therefore this Ca&s;e falls to be regulated by <HI>Prop.</HI> IV.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">
Po&s;&s;ibly it may not be thought an u&s;ele&s;s Piece of Curio&s;ity to &s;ee this made out from other Prin|ciples. In all Ca&s;es it carries &s;trong Conviction, when it is found, that different Principles coincide in the &s;ame Conclu&s;ions. The Principle of Law that leads me to this Point is as follows, That when different Per&s;ons are bound to one another in mutual and reciprocal Obligements to a certain End, in every Thing they do with Relation to the Contract, they are bound to have in View the Sup|port and Accompli&s;hment thereof. In other Words, the Law con&s;iders Per&s;ons, &s;o bound together, as in a <HI>Society,</HI> with Relation to their common Af|fair. And it is a Rule in Society, that every Member ought to act for the common Behoof. Thus a Purcha&s;er of Land buying in a collateral Right, cannot pur&s;ue a Warrandice again&s;t the Seller upon the Footing of Eviction; but mu&s;t re|&s;trict his Claim to the Money he paid for the col|lateral Right, which is &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been bought in with a View to the common Intere&s;t. Thus a Wad&s;etter buying in a preferable Title to the E&s;tate, is under&s;tood to do it for the joint Be|hoof of him&s;elf and Rever&s;er; and therefore cannot plead upon it again&s;t Redemption of the Lands. The &s;ame will be found to obtain betwixt a Cre|ditor and a Cautioner who has renounced the Be|nefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. For as to the proper Cautioner, his Benefit of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as above &s;et forth, affords him more ample Security than he has by this Prin|ciple. To come to Particulars. If the Creditor adjudge, inhibit, or take any other additional Se|curity, he is under&s;tood as carrying on a <HI>commune negotium,</HI> for the Behoof of him&s;elf and Cautioners. Which infers, that he ought to communicate &s;uch
<PB N="42" REF="45">
additional Security to the Cautioner performing his Part by paying the Debt. In which View it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, when any additional Security is granted to a Creditor, as it is a Security for the Debt it&s;elf, of con&s;equence it mu&s;t be a common Security, to all who are concerned as Cautioners, to &s;ee the Debt paid. All this proceeds from what is commonly called the <HI>bona fides contractus.</HI> And thus it is made out from the Nature of the Con|tract it&s;elf, that the Creditor is bound to a&s;&s;ign his Debt and Diligence to the Cautioner upon Pay|ment. It is a natural Con&s;equence from this, that if the Creditor di&s;charge any additional Secu|rity, it operates Relief <HI>pro tanto</HI> to the Cautioner. Which being fix'd Law with us, is a Confirmation of this Doctrine. For it obviou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;es, that the Cautioner has an antecedent Right to demand A&s;&s;ignation, without which it would be nothing to the Cautioner, whether the Creditor di&s;charge the additional Security or not. From the &s;ame Prin|ciple it follows, that a Creditor in a per&s;onal Bond with Cautioners, u&s;ing Inhibition again&s;t the De|bitor, and thereafter lending Money to the Debi|tor upon heritable Security, is bound notwith&s;tand|ing to a&s;&s;ign his Inhibition to the Cautioner upon Payment, tho' again&s;t him&s;elf, becau&s;e the Inhibi|tion is a common Security for the Debt, both to Principal and Cautioner; which Security the Cau|tioner cannot be defrauded of by any After-deed of the Creditors. And if a Creditor cannot di&s;charge any additional Security <HI>directly,</HI> neither will he be allowed to do it <HI>indirectly</HI> by the Circuit of lending Money to the Debitor. It follows, 2<HI>do,</HI> That if the Creditor cannot &s;afely lend to the Debitor after
<PB N="43" REF="46">
the Date of the additional Security, as little can he purcha&s;e in.</P>
<P>But now let us &s;uppo&s;e the heritable Bond prior to the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Cautioner. And let us al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e it Law, that Inhibition does &s;trike again&s;t po&s;terior Alienations to the Inhibiter him&s;elf. In this Ca&s;e there is nothing in this Principle at lea&s;t, why the Creditor &s;hould be obliged to a&s;&s;ign at all, far le&s;s to a&s;&s;ign again&s;t him&s;elf. For tho' upon this Principle the Creditor is bound to a&s;&s;ign to the Cautioner, who has renounced the Benefit of Di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, whatever additional Securities were ob|tained after the Date of the cautionry Engagement, the &s;ame will not hold with Re&s;pect to anterior Se|curities, becau&s;e the&s;e cannot be regulated by the Laws of Society, being before the Society ex|i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Another EXCEPTION we &s;hall give is of three different Sort of Creditors upon the &s;ame Subject 1<HI>mo,</HI> An Annualrenter or Annuitant. 2<HI>do,</HI> A Life|rent Infeftment of Locality. 3<HI>tio,</HI> An Adjudger. One would readily think of reducing this to the common Ca&s;e by con&s;idering the Liferent Infeft|ment as one Subject, the Adjudication of the Property as another, and the Annualrenter or Annuitant, as a preferable Infeftment over both. But when the Na|ture of an Annualrent, or Annuity is con&s;idered, this will be found a wrong Conception of the Mat|ter. An Annualrenter or Annuitant ought fir&s;t to draw his Payment out of the Fruits; and it is but by a &s;ub&s;idiary Right that he is entitled to claim the Property it&s;elf. This is obvious from the Acti|on of poinding the Ground, the Stile of which carries the Poinder only to affect the Property, <HI>fail|ing</HI> Moveables upon the Ground. In this View the
<PB N="44" REF="47">
Rents &s;tand as <HI>principal Debitor,</HI> the Ground on|ly as <HI>Cautioner.</HI> From this Con&s;ideration the Life|rent Infeftment by Locality ought to be intirely bur|dened with the Annuity or Annualrent. There is no Place therefore for a proportional Allocation, and con&s;equently no Foundation for Relief.</P>
<P>But what if the Annualrenter or Annuitant &s;uf|fer the Locali&s;t to uplift the whole Rents, tru&s;ting to his &s;ub&s;idiary Action again&s;t the Property. This plainly would be acting <HI>arbitrarily,</HI> by giving a par|tial Preference to the Locali&s;t: And therefore the Adjudger in this Ca&s;e would be entitled, not only to a proportional, but to a total Relief again&s;t the Locali&s;t. And further, If the&s;e preferable Creditors ly out, and refu&s;e to intromet, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why the Adjudger may not be entitled to uplift the Rents in their Name.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> Here it is taken for granted, That as a Lo|cali&s;t is a liferent Proprietor, &s;he can have on poind|ing of the Ground for any Inlacks of the Rents, more than an ab&s;olute Proprietor can; and &s;o the&s;e Inlacks are not a real Burden upon the Ground as the Inlacks of an Aunuity are. All the Remedy &s;he has is to adjudge the Fie upon her Warrandice, which will bring her in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with other Ad|judgers upon per&s;onal Rights. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he has adjudged upon her Warrandice; but this will make no Difference, it will not bring on a proportional Allocation. The Annuity, or Annu|alrent continues &s;till a Burden upon the Locality; and all the Alteration is, that the Locali&s;t, upon her Warrandice, comes in among the other Adjud|gers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">
2<HI>do,</HI> What if the Annuitant, or Annualrenter, actually a&s;&s;ign to the Locali&s;t? If this was done &s;ub&s;equent to the Date of the Adjudication, it will avail nothing, &s;ee <HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> V. unle&s;s perhaps it be allowed the Force of an Adjudication, to bring in the Locali&s;t <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> as if &s;he had adjud|ged upon her Warrandice. There is even a Scruple if this A&s;&s;ignation &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained, though of a Date prior to the Adjudication; becau&s;e it tends to cut out the per&s;onal Creditors, who re&s;t &s;ecure to ad|judge <HI>quandocunque</HI> as long as no other Adjudica|tion &s;tands in their Way. But this Scruple is al|ready obviated <HI>Schol.</HI> 1. <HI>Prop.</HI> I.</P>
<P>3<HI>tio,</HI> If the Annuity and Locality be ve&s;ted in the &s;ame Per&s;on before the Exi&s;tence of any other Right upon the E&s;tate, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion my be attributed to either to &s;ave both. This is clear from <HI>Prop </HI> IV. And though the Matter &s;hould be reckoned doubt|ful as to a Renunciation, which can never be a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Deed when granted to a Locali&s;t, who has not Power like a Creditor to uplift, there can be no Dubiety when the Locali&s;t purcha&s;es the Annuity, &amp; <HI>e contra;</HI> becau&s;e there is no Rea&s;on &s;uch Com|merce &s;hould be di&s;countenanced.</P>
<P>This is all to be under&s;tood of an Annuity and Locality concurring for the &s;ame Years: But if there be prior Annuities due before the Commencement of the Liferent Right, the&s;e cannot be &s;aid to be a natural Burden upon every Year's Fruits falling due to the Liferenter, as the yearly Annuities are; and therefore the Creditors cannot force the Annuitant to draw them out of the Rents. As little can they be reckoned a proper Burden upon the Fie con&s;ider|ed exclu&s;ive of the Liferent; but they ought rather to be con&s;idered as a catholick Burden, and the
<PB N="46" REF="49">
Liferent and Fie as two &s;eparate E&s;tates &s;ubject to them; and therefore to be drawn <HI>proportionally</HI> out of each, <HI>i. e.</HI> upon a Sale they are to be paid out of the fir&s;t End of the Price, the Remainder there|of to go to the Locali&s;t in Liferent, and the Adjud|gers in Fie.</P>
<P>Another EXCEPTION is as follows. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Locality the preferable Right. 2<HI>do.</HI> The Infeftment of Annualrent or Annuity. 3<HI>tio,</HI> The Adjudger. At the &s;ame Time let us &s;uppo&s;e, That the Liferenter con&s;ents to the po&s;terior Annualrent|right; by Virtue of this Con&s;ent the Annualren|ter will be preferable. Has the Locali&s;t in this Ca&s;e a <HI>total,</HI> or only a <HI>proportional</HI> Relief again&s;t the Adjudger? The An&s;wer is, She has a <HI>total</HI> Relief; becau&s;e the Con&s;ent here is private betwixt the Annualrenter and Locali&s;t, and can operate no|thing in Favours of the Adjudger. Be&s;ides, there is implied in the Con&s;ent an Obligation upon the Annualrenter to keep the Locali&s;t <HI>indemnis,</HI> &s;o far as con&s;i&s;tent with his own Intere&s;t: Therefore what the Annualrenter uplifts in this Ca&s;e is under&s;tood as in Name of the Locali&s;t, and he takes the Rent not as in Payment of his own Claim, but as Money re|ceived from the Locali&s;t for the Purcha&s;e of his Right; which therefore he is obliged to a&s;&s;ign &s;o far as he receives. Thus the Paction is not extended to be a <HI>direct Preference</HI> to the Annualrenter, but inter|preted to be only an <HI>Obligation</HI> upon the Locali&s;t to communicate her Rents to him, or, which is the &s;ame, to allow him to uplift in her Name. And &s;o it was found. <HI>Home,</HI> 17. <HI>February</HI> 1727, Competition Lady <HI>Ludquhairn</HI> with her Husband's Creditors. But what if &s;uch Con&s;ent were <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> conceiv'd,
<PB N="47" REF="50">
would not this bring it to the former Ca&s;e, as if the Annualrenter were &s;imply preferable?</P>
<P>To compleat this E&s;&s;ay, it will be proper to look into the Deci&s;ions of our Court of Se&s;&s;ion, and to examine how far they have followed or varied from the Principles here laid down. They are as follow,</P>
<P>An Annualrent being payable out of two Tenements which came afterwards into the Hands of different &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors; it was found, That the Annual|renter might uplift the whole out of any one of the Tenements, a&s;&s;igning again&s;t the other for Relief. <HI>Stair</HI> 26th <HI>June</HI> 1662, <HI>Adam&s;on</HI> contra Lord <HI>Balme|rino.</HI> This is an Example of the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A Cautioner upon Payment craving A&s;&s;ignation again&s;t his Co-cautioner, the Lords found the Cre|ditor not obliged to a&s;&s;ign, the Cautioner being &s;uf|ficiently &s;ecured in Law by his Action for Relief. <HI>Newbyth, Stair</HI> 10th <HI>July</HI> 1666, <HI>Home</HI> contra <HI>Craw|furd.</HI> In this Ca&s;e tho' hard to deny A&s;&s;ignation, yet the Di&s;pute perhaps was of little Importance, &s;ince the Relief that was competent might be as effectual.</P>
<P>In a Competition an Adjudger &s;ubjected to an In|hibition offering to purge by Payment of the Debt; the Creditor was found obliged to a&s;&s;ign his Inhibi|tion, but not in &s;o far as it might be prejudicial to other Debts in his Per&s;on. <HI>Stair</HI> 19th <HI>July</HI> 1672, <HI>Chie&s;ly</HI> contra <HI>Hay.</HI> The like, <HI>Stair</HI> 11th <HI>February</HI> 1676, <HI>Bruce</HI> contra <HI>Mitchel.</HI> The&s;e Deci&s;ions are defective in &s;o far as they do not mention, whether the Inhibiters &s;econdary Debt was of a Date prior or po&s;terior to the Adjudication. If prior, the Deci&s;i|ons are founded in <HI>Prop.</HI> III. If po&s;terior the Relief ought to be proportional <HI>per Prop.</HI> IV.</P>
<P>A Creditor being preferable over two Tenements and a &s;econdary Creditor having a Right only over one
<PB N="48" REF="51">
of them, in that Situation the preferable Creditor for a &s;eparate Debt adjudg'd both Tenements; it was found, That the Catholick Creditor was not obliged to di&s;pone to the &s;econdary Creditor in Prejudice of his Adjudication exi&s;ting before the Date of the Pro|ce&s;s. <HI>Stair</HI> 6th <HI>Nov.</HI> 1678, <HI>Miln</HI> contra <HI>Hay.</HI> By this Deci&s;ion and &s;ome others to be mentioned here|after, it &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the Catholick Creditor is in Safety to lend upon the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> before he be interpelled by <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> at the In&s;tance of the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A.</HI> It will undoubt|edly be allowed, that if he is interpelled by <HI>Inti|mation,</HI> as is above propo&s;ed, the Effect would be the &s;ame. By the&s;e Deci&s;ions then we may reckon it as e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Intimation is nece&s;&s;ary to interpel the catholick Creditor, without which he may &s;afe|ly lend upon the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> though in Prejudice of the &s;econdary Creditor upon <HI>A;</HI> and this in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;uper&s;edes the Nece&s;&s;ity of making an Act of <HI>Sederunt</HI> to that Effect.</P>
<P>It may further be remarked upon this Deci&s;ion, That if the Bond upon which Adjudication pa&s;t, was prior in Date to the Notification of the &s;econ|dary Creditor's Infeftment, upon that Suppo&s;ition the catholick Creditor was not at all bound to a&s;&s;ign, <HI>Argum. Prop.</HI> III. becau&s;e though he might be <HI>in mala fide</HI> to lend upon <HI>B,</HI> after he knew of ano|ther Debt upon <HI>A;</HI> yet not to adjudge upon a pri|or Debt, that being <HI>nece&s;&s;itatis</HI> not <HI>voluntatis.</HI></P>
<P>Similar is the Ca&s;e ob&s;erved by <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> 3<HI>d January</HI> 1696, <HI>Scotland</HI> contra <HI>Bairdner,</HI> where in a Competition betwixt a Liferentrix, who only had her Liferent upliftable out of the half of the Subject, and a Creditor who&s;e Infeftment affected
<PB N="49" REF="52">
the whole, and was prior to that of the Liferentrix, and who had al&s;o an Adjudication, but po&s;terior to the Liferent Right; &s;he craving, that he might be decerned to a&s;&s;ign her as to one half, in regard the other was &s;ufficient to pay him his Annualrent: The Lords thought, that if he acquired any &s;uch Adjudication le&s;s preferable <HI>po&s;t litem motam,</HI> he might be reputed <HI>in mala fide</HI> to make U&s;e of &s;uch Right to impede his a&s;&s;igning to the Liferentrix; but if he had got it before, then there was no Law hindring him to do the &s;ame, and to cover it by his better Right; and &s;o the Lords refu&s;ed to decern him to a&s;&s;ign the Liferentrix again&s;t the other half, in Prejudice of his Adjudication. Here again the Nece&s;&s;ity of Intimation is enforced.</P>
<P>An A&s;&s;ignation to &s;ome Goods by a Bankrupt to his Creditor in Security and Payment, being reduced upon the Act 1696 by another Creditor, and the Re|ducer at the &s;ame Time arre&s;ting in the A&s;&s;igney's Hands, and pur&s;uing a Forthcoming; the A&s;&s;igney was contented to make the Goods forthcoming, but craved A&s;&s;ignation from the Pur&s;uer to his cumula|tive Security by Adjudication, in &s;o far as he &s;hould pay, that &s;o he might operate his Relief out of the common Debitor's Effects <HI>pro tanto;</HI> The Lords found this relevant, and ordained the Pur&s;uer to a&s;|&s;ign, but with this expre&s;s Quality, That the Pur|&s;uer &s;hould be preferred <HI>quoad</HI> his Debt, and the A&s;&s;igney &s;hould not compete with him for the &s;ame. <HI>Fountainhall, Forbes</HI> 19. <HI>December</HI> 1705, <HI>Reid</HI> con|tra <HI>Man.</HI> This Deci&s;ion is certainly well founded. There can be no Pretence for obliging a catholick Creditor, who gets Payment only of a Part of his catholick Debt, to a&s;&s;ign in Proportion to that Pay|ment, which may tend in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to re&s;trict
<PB N="50" REF="53">
his Claim for the Remainder. 'Tis fair in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, if he a&s;&s;ign at any Rate.</P>
<P>A Creditor by Bond, wherein three Per&s;ons were bound as Co-principals, being the fir&s;t Arre|&s;ter of a Subject, belonging to one of his Debitors, was not found obliged to a&s;&s;ign his Bond to the o|ther Arre&s;ters, for recovering of the other two Co-principals the Superplus paid to him, out of the com|mon Debitor's Effects, more than his third Share, altho' Relief of two Thirds was competent to the common Debitor him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e Co-princi|pals. For this Rea&s;on, That the Creditors po&s;t|poned might affect the &s;aid Relief by Diligences. <HI>Forbes</HI> 24. <HI>February</HI> 1708. <HI>Kennedy</HI> contra <HI>Vans</HI> and <HI>Crawford.</HI> This Deci&s;ion is one of very few that are not ea&s;ie to be adju&s;ted to Principles, running contrary to the primary Law of a proportional Al|location. It appears obvious, That the <HI>ratio deci|dendi,</HI> which may po&s;&s;ibly be the Ob&s;erver's, is by no Means conclu&s;ive. For if A&s;&s;ignation is never to be granted, where the Creditor craving A&s;&s;ignation has otherwi&s;e Action competent again&s;t the Per&s;on or Subject; it will follow, that A&s;&s;ignations &s;hould never be granted in any Ca&s;e. At that Rate, in the known Ca&s;e of a catholick Right over two Tene|ments belonging to the &s;ame common Debitor, and a &s;econdary Right over one of them; the &s;econdary Creditor could not &s;eek A&s;&s;ignation a|gain&s;t the other Tenement, becau&s;e he might affect it by Diligence. And it is remarkable, That the Deci&s;ions, as handed down to us, run &s;o cro&s;s to one another, that &s;ometimes it has been &s;u&s;tained as a good Rea&s;on for denying A&s;&s;ignation, that the Subject de&s;igned to be affected, in vertue of the A&s;|&s;ignation, did not belong to the common Debitor;
<PB N="51" REF="54">
and con&s;equently was not otherwi&s;e to be come at, but thro' Aid of the A&s;&s;ignation. See below, <HI>Forbes</HI> 29. <HI>June</HI> 1714. <HI>Ker</HI> contra Creditors of <HI>Harden.</HI> But now, what if another Creditor of the common De|bitor's has <HI>ab ante</HI> affected this Relief? The An|&s;wer is, That it will &s;ignifie nothing. For, let us make a Suppo&s;ition, which is exceeding rational, That the catholick Creditor had drawn his Payment equally from the three Co-obligants; upon that Sup|po&s;ition, as there would be no Foundation for Re|lief, the Creditor who had affected it could draw nothing. It can make no Difference, that the ca|tholick Creditor chu&s;es to draw his Whole from one. The very De&s;ign of an A&s;&s;ignation, is to remedy this Inequality; and to put all Things upon the &s;ame Footing, as if he had drawn <HI>equally</HI> and <HI>pro|portionally,</HI> which every catholick Creditor is &s;up|po&s;ed to do, when the Que&s;tion is anent Relief, com|petent to &s;econdary Creditors among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A Party having two Infeftments of Annualrent, one prior and another po&s;terior to the Infeftment of another Creditor, who&s;e Infeftment was only of a Part of the Lands, he, who had the fir&s;t and third, being infeft in the whole, and taking up his Annual|rent out of that Part only, wherein the other &s;tood infeft, whereby that other was di&s;appointed; and therefore craved in a Proce&s;s, to be a&s;&s;igned to a Proportion, &amp;c. The Lords found, That where a po&s;terior Creditor pays a prior out of his own Mo|ney, he has a Title to demand A&s;&s;ignation; but if he leaves him to get his Payment out of the Debi|tors Means, the catholick Creditor is not obliged to a&s;&s;ign but with a Quality and Re&s;ervation, that it &s;hall not prejudice his other Debts and Rights, tho' po&s;terior to the Party's Right, who craves the A&s;|&s;ignation.

<P>Brigadier <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> Purcha&s;er of the E&s;tate of <HI>Val|leyfield</HI> at a publick Roup, offered to the Lords a Scheme for drawing the Price, wherein it appeared, that he had Right to &s;ome Debts, preferable over the whole E&s;tate, and to others preferable over particu|lar Parcels: And pretending to exhau&s;t the rema|nent Price of the &s;eparate Parcels, affected by his ca|tholick Debts, in order to bring in the other Debts purcha&s;ed in by him, preferable, as &s;aid is, upon particular Parcels. This was oppo&s;ed by Colonel <HI>Erskine,</HI> who alledged, that the catholick Debts, preferable upon the whole E&s;tate, ought to be taken out of the whole Head of the Price, whereby the Price of every particular Parcel of the E&s;tate would be dimini&s;hed proportionally; and he, the Colonel, of Con&s;equence, would draw &s;ome Share of the re|manent Price; whereas, by the Brigadier's Scheme, he was intirely excluded. The Lords found, the Brigadier might exhau&s;t the Price of any Part of the E&s;tate, by his &s;overeign Rights affecting the whole; and that he might make the be&s;t U&s;e he could of his Rights, providing the &s;ame were not <HI>acquired,</HI> or made u&s;e of <HI>in emulationem</HI> of the Colonel. <HI>Bruce.</HI> 22. <HI>February</HI> 1715. Brigadier <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> contra Colo|nel <HI>Erskine.</HI> Here the Fact is not di&s;tinctly laid down, whether the Purcha&s;es made by the Brigadier, of his &s;econdary Rights, were prior or po&s;terior to
<PB N="53" REF="56">
the Exi&s;tence of tho&s;e belonging to the Colonel. If prior, the Deci&s;ion is agreeable to the Corrollary of Prop. III. otherwi&s;e if po&s;terior; unle&s;s it be put up|on the Footing, that Colonel <HI>Erskine</HI> gave no Inti|mation to the Brigadier of the Exi&s;tence of his Rights. And the Provi&s;ion at the Clo&s;e of the In|terlocutor &s;hews plain enough the Opinion of the Court, as to this Matter: For after &s;uch Intima|tion, any &s;econdary Rights purcha&s;ed in by the Brigadier, who was catholick Creditor, mu&s;t un|doubtedly be deemed, <HI>to be acquired and made u&s;e of</HI> in emulationem <HI>of the Colonel.</HI></P>
<P>A Creditor ranked in the &s;econd Place did after the Ranking purcha&s;e in the preferable Debt, and having the&s;e two Rights in his Per&s;on, he became Purcha&s;er of the E&s;tate at a publick Sale, and gave Bond for the Price payable to his Creditors as they were ranked. The preferable Debt purchas'd in by him, as &s;aid is, did not only reach over the Lands purchas'd by him at the publick Roup, but al&s;o over a &s;eparate Subject belonging to another. The Fact was, That the Price of the Lands &s;old publick|ly was but &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the preferable Right; and therefore the Purcha&s;er, willing to bring his &s;e|condary Claim within the Price, craved Payment of his preferable Right intirely out of the &s;eparate Sub|ject; which the Lords refu&s;ed, and found, That the &s;aid Debt, being in the Per&s;on of the Purcha&s;er of the Lands upon which it was ranked <HI>primo loco,</HI> which Purcha&s;er granted Bond for Payment of the Price to the Creditors as ranked, the &s;aid Debt be|came <HI>eo ip&s;o</HI> extingui&s;hed <HI>confu&s;ione,</HI> and could not revive to be a Charge upon the &s;eparate Subject. 13th <HI>June,</HI> 1729.

<PB N="54" REF="57">
it is clearly laid down, that after Intimation, by Proce&s;s, of a &s;econdary Right, the proportional Re|lief will obtain, tho' the preferable and any other &s;econdary Right &s;hould come into the &s;ame Per&s;on. When the Matter is brought here, it will follow, that any legal Intimation is &s;ufficient. For it would be ridiculous to impo&s;e the Nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing a Proce&s;s, when there is nothing el&s;e in view but to in|timate a Fact to the Defender. Thus then we may hold it as an e&s;tabli&s;hed Point in our Practice, that the Catholick-creditor may renounce his Right upon the Tenement <HI>A,</HI> lend a &s;econd Debt upon that Tenement, or purcha&s;e in a Debt upon it at any Time without being oblig'd to &s;earch the Re|gi&s;ters, until actual Intimation be made to him of a &s;econdary Right upon the Tenement <HI>B.</HI></P>

It was an&s;wered for the Creditors, That no Per&s;on is intitled to demand A&s;&s;ignation, unle&s;s a|gain&s;t his own Debitors Effects. The Lords found, That in &s;o far as Sir <HI>William Scot</HI>'s Creditors are either paid out of his E&s;tate, or out of his other Effects, they are not bound to a&s;&s;ign their Debts and Diligences in Favours of <HI>Chatto, Forbes</HI> 29. <HI>June</HI> 1714, <HI>Scot</HI> contra <HI>Ker.</HI> That this Deci&s;ion is re|concileable

with the Principles above laid down, I &s;ee not, unle&s;s we take a &s;eparate Circum&s;tance into Con&s;ideration, tho' not at all laid hold upon by the Collector. Sir <HI>William Scot</HI> had tailied his Land E&s;tate with &s;trict prohibitory and irritant clau&s;es. Now tho' this could not &s;ave the E&s;tate from his own Debts, yet it may infer a very natu|ral Pre&s;umption, That Sir <HI>William</HI> intended his &s;eparate Funds &s;hould go in the fir&s;t Place for Pay|ment of his Debts. If this be well founded, the Deci&s;ion is extreamly ju&s;tifiable; for the &s;eparate Funds to which <HI>Robert Scot</HI> &s;ucceeded upon his Confirmation and general Service, have been con&s;i|dered as the principal Debitor, and the tailied E|&s;tate as Cautioner only; and therefore in this View, it had been wrong done by the Creditors to a&s;&s;ign again&s;t the tailied E&s;tate, had they been ever &s;o willing.</P>
<P>In the Year 1685, <HI>M'Guffoc</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;co,</HI> Heri|tor of the Lands of <HI>Borgue,</HI> granted an heritable Bond for the Sum of 2000 <HI>lib.</HI> out of the &s;aid Lands in Favours of <HI>Irving</HI> of <HI>Logan,</HI> whereupon the Creditor was infeft the &s;ame Year. Thereafter the &s;aid <HI>Ru&s;co</HI> granted a Di&s;po&s;ition of the Lands of <HI>Borgue</HI> in Favours of his &s;econd Son <HI>David Blair,</HI> re&s;erving a Faculty to alter; but which Faculty he afterwards renounced in his Son's Contract of Marriage. <HI>M'Guffoc</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;co</HI> be|ing overcharged with Debt, in the 1727 his E|&s;tate was brought to a Sale; and the &s;aid <HI>Irving</HI> of <HI>Logan,</HI> who had adjudged all his Debitor's Lands for the above mentioned Debt of 2000 <HI>lib.</HI> was ranked as a preferable Creditor: And upon his drawing Payment, it was demanded by the
<PB N="56" REF="59">
other Creditors, that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ign them to his Infeftment upon the Lands of <HI>Borgue,</HI> according to the general Rule in the&s;e Ca&s;es, that who has a preferable Infeftment in two different Subjects for the &s;ame Debt, if he chu&s;e to draw his whole Claim out of one, is obliged to a&s;&s;ign to the Cre|ditors po&s;tponed, to afford them a proportional Relief out of the other Subject. This was oppo&s;ed by the Relict and Children of <HI>Borgue,</HI> upon this <HI>medium,</HI> That by <HI>Ru&s;co</HI>'s Di&s;po&s;ition to his &s;econd Son, and After-con&s;ent in that Son's Contract of Marriage, he became bound to warrant the &s;aid Lands; the Con&s;equence whereof is, that had <HI>Irving</HI> of <HI>Logan</HI> drawn his whole Sum out of their Lands, they mu&s;t have been intitled to de|mand A&s;&s;ignation again&s;t <HI>Ru&s;co</HI> bound to them in Warrandice, ju&s;t as much as a Creditor who takes Payment from a Cautioner is obliged to a&s;|&s;ign him again&s;t the principal Debitor. An&s;wer'd, <HI>Ru&s;co</HI> was never bound to warrand his Son <HI>David</HI> and his Heirs again&s;t <HI>Logan</HI>'s Debt. The Di&s;|po&s;ition was under a re&s;erv'd Faculty, to con|tract Debt, alter and di&s;po&s;e of the E&s;tate, &amp;c. and con&s;equently the Debt already contracted, could be no Contravention of the Warrandice; and &s;uppo&s;ing the Son had paid the Debt, he could never have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his Father for the &s;ame; and con&s;equently an A&s;&s;ignation would have been fruitle&s;s and ineffectual. Nor does the Father's After-con&s;ent in his Son's Contract of Marriage, which implied a Renunciation of his Faculty any way alter the Ca&s;e: For by no In|terpretation can this be drawn to import an Obli|gation upon the Father to warrand or relieve his

There may occur &s;ome Difficulty in adju&s;ting the real Relief in this Ca&s;e; which will be &s;olv'd by comparing this Ca&s;e with that abovementioned of a Catholick Ad|judger of two Tenements; Another Adjudger with|in Year and Day upon the Tenement <HI>A;</HI> a third without Year and Day upon the Tenement <HI>B.</HI> Here the Lands of <HI>Borgue</HI> &s;tand for the Tenement <HI>B,</HI> and <HI>David Blair</HI> Proprietor thereof for the Ad|judger without Year and Day.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Dalglei&s;h,</HI> Creditor to Earl of <HI>Ro&s;eberry,</HI> ar|re&s;ted the Rents of his E&s;tate in the Tenants Hands, as al&s;o a per&s;onal Bond of his in the Hands of Mr. <HI>John Alves</HI> the Debitor. Thereafter the &s;ame Rents were arre&s;ted by <HI>Blair</HI> another Creditor, who by Decreet of Furthcoming was preferred <HI>&s;ecundo loco</HI> on that Subject. La&s;t of all the common Debitor granted A&s;&s;ignation of Mr. <HI>John Alves</HI>'s Bond for onerous Cau&s;es to <HI>Archibald Robert&s;on</HI> Merchant in <HI>Edin|burgh.</HI> This A&s;&s;ignation obliged the Debitor in the Bond to rai&s;e a Multiply-poinding, wherein the Arre&s;ter was preferred to the A&s;&s;igney. This gave Occa&s;ion to <HI>Robert&s;on</HI> the A&s;&s;igney, who&s;e Subject was thus carried away by the Arre&s;ter, to demand an A&s;&s;ignation to the Arre&s;ter's Debt and Diligence, in order to operate his Relief out of the other Sub|ject affected thereby, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> the Rents of the E&s;tate in the Tenants Hands. Again&s;t that Demand <HI>Blair,</HI> the &s;econd Arre&s;ter of that Subject, appeared for his Intere&s;t. It was pled for him, That the common
<PB N="58" REF="61">
Debitor could not put the Arre&s;ter in a wor&s;e Situa|tion by granting A&s;&s;ignation to <HI>Robert&s;on;</HI> And therefore that he is intitled to a total A&s;&s;ignation, as if the A&s;&s;ignation had not been granted. It was an&s;wered, That the common Debitor remained Fiar of the Bond ju&s;t as much after <HI>Blair</HI>'s Arre&s;t|ment as before, the Arre&s;tment not affecting the Bond; and therefore his A&s;&s;ignation to <HI>Robert&s;on</HI> was valid and effectual in Law; and did infer an Obligation upon the Catholick-creditor, chu&s;ing to draw his Payment out of a Fund that now no longer belonged to his Debitor, to a&s;&s;ign for a total Relief; which Obligation was infer'd from the Principles of Remuneration. To this it was replied by the &s;econd Arre&s;ter, That the Bond, being affected by the preferable Arre&s;tment, was made litigious; and therefore was &s;till to be con&s;idered as remaining in the Per&s;on of the common Debitor. The Lords found, that Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Dalglei&s;h</HI> was not obliged to a&s;&s;ign to the A&s;&s;igney <HI>Robert&s;on</HI> in Prejudice of <HI>Blair</HI>'s Arre&s;tment. 12th <HI>June</HI> 1730.

In this Proce&s;s the Que&s;tion occur'd, Whether <HI>John|&s;ton</HI> was bound to a&s;&s;ign the Inhibition to <HI>Suttie</HI> u|pon Payment? <HI>John&s;ton</HI> pled, That the Inhibition &s;trikeing again&s;t his heritable Bond, the Law did not oblige him to a&s;&s;ign again&s;t him&s;elf. <HI>Suttie</HI> con|tended, That this Rule holds not betwixt Cautio|ners who &s;eeking Relief off one another, are bound in &s;trict Law from the Nature of the Contract to a&s;&s;ign.

In this Ca&s;e, ac|cording to the plaine&s;t Principles, <HI>Suttie</HI> paying the Debt, would be intitled to demand A&s;&s;ignation to the Inhibition, tho' exclu&s;ive of the heritable Bond. See <HI>Page</HI> 40. 'Tis another Que&s;tion, how far the Inhibition would in this Ca&s;e be &s;erviceable when a&s;&s;igned; but this comes not in in a Ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, where the heritable Bond was granted to a|nother than the Inhibiter. Continuing &s;till the Sup|po&s;ition, That <HI>Gordon</HI> was Creditor in both Bonds, let us draw a little nearer to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e by taking in the Con&s;ideration of the Bond of Corro|boration, wherein <HI>John&s;ton</HI> acceded as Cautioner.
<PB N="60" REF="63">
Here <HI>John&s;ton</HI> paying the Debt, would have Right to demand A&s;&s;ignation to the Inhibition. And when he is &s;eeking Relief off <HI>Suttie,</HI> 'tis as evident he mu&s;t transfer the Debt and Diligence to him, in order to operate his Relief again&s;t the principal Debitor. For if he acts as Creditor, the Thing is apparent; if as Cautioner upon the Clau&s;e in the Bond of Corro|boration, it will come to the &s;ame: For if a Cre|ditor be bound to a&s;&s;ign upon Payment, <HI>multo ma|gis</HI> a Co-cautioner who has a Bond of Relief. To come clo&s;e to the Ca&s;e in Hand, if <HI>Gordon</HI> was bound to a&s;&s;ign to <HI>Suttie</HI> even again&s;t him&s;elf, tho' he had been Lender of the heritable Bond, he cannot put him in a wor&s;e Situation by choo&s;ing to take his Debt from <HI>John&s;ton.</HI> And <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> who comes in <HI>Gordon</HI>'s Place by the A&s;&s;ignation, cannot be in a better Situation than <HI>Gordon</HI> him&s;elf would be, had he been the Lender of the heritable Bond. To take this Matter in the neare&s;t View, <HI>Gordon</HI>'s Inhibition became an additional Security for the Debt, for the Benefit of him&s;elf and all the Cautioners. Therefore whichever Cautioner was burdened with the Debt had a Right to the Inhibition in order to operate his Relief again&s;t the principal Debitor; and there|upon was intitled to reduce every Deed po&s;terior to the Inhibition in who&s;e-ever Favours granted.</P>

<P>_IN the E&s;&s;ay upon the <HI>Beneficium ceden|dendarum actionum,</HI> we have endea|voured to lay down, after what Man|ner Creditors catholick and &s;econdary are to draw their Payment from the &s;everal Per&s;ons, and out of the &s;everal Subjects bur|dened with their Debts. The De&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay is to lay down &s;ome Rules for extricating the Pre|ferences of Creditors and Di&s;ponees competing upon the &s;ame Subject. In the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay the Que|&s;tion is, Having given the Order of Preference, to determine the Method of drawing Payment out of the different Funds, and from the different Per|&s;ons liable in the Debts. In this the Que&s;tion is, Having given the Fund to determine the ab&s;olute and partial Preferences, and what each Competitor &s;hall draw?</P>
<P>For Method's Sake, we &s;hall fir&s;t take under Con&s;ideration the Competition of Creditors among them&s;elves. The&s;e &s;tand <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>re&s;tricted</HI> ac|cording to the Extent of their Claims. After di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing which, the Competition among Di&s;ponees, &amp;c. fall in, who&s;e Claims, upon the Subject contravert|ed, are from their Nature unlimited, and totally exclu&s;ive of others.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="65">
In the Preferences that ari&s;e &s;imply from Priority of Time, there can ari&s;e no Dubiety among com|peting Creditors. <HI>Potior tempore, potior jure,</HI> is a Rule upon which Preferences may be as ea&s;ily determin'd, as it is to determine, that this Year, this Hour, this Day is po&s;terior to the la&s;t. The Difficulties that ari&s;e proceed from partial Grounds of Preference, that one Creditor obtains again&s;t another, whereby it happens, that he who is po&s;te|rior in Time, &s;hall &s;ometimes exclude and be pre|ferred to one, or another that is prior. To give an Example. Suppo&s;e three Annualrenters, <HI>A, B, C,</HI> all in Order of Time, &s;uppo&s;e at the &s;ame Time <HI>A</HI> con&s;enting to <HI>C</HI>'s Preference: In this Ca&s;e <HI>A</HI> is pre|ferable to <HI>B, B</HI> to <HI>C,</HI> and <HI>C</HI> again to <HI>A: A</HI> to <HI>B,</HI> and <HI>B</HI> to <HI>C,</HI> by Priority of Time, and <HI>C</HI> to <HI>A,</HI> by the Con&s;ent. In Ca&s;es of this Nature, if the Debts exceed the Fund, it will be found no ea&s;y Matter to adju&s;t what every Creditor &s;hould draw.</P>
<P>Before we come to the Point, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the Force and Effect of the Con&s;ent that the la&s;t Creditor has obtained from the fir&s;t. This Con&s;ent mu&s;t be con&s;idered in one of two Views. 1<HI>mo,</HI> As giving the Right con&s;ented to, all the Benefit of the Con&s;enter's Diligence; that is, inter|preting the Con&s;ent as a <HI>virtual A&s;&s;ignation.</HI> Or, 2<HI>do,</HI> As giving it only a <HI>Preference,</HI> &s;o as to in|title the Creditor con&s;ented to, to draw as if the Con&s;enter were not in the Field. This la&s;t is the true Meaning of the Con&s;ent, and all the Force that the Law allows it; and which indeed is the only View in which the Matter can be attended with any Difficulty. For if the Con&s;ent be under|&s;tood as a <HI>virtual A&s;&s;ignation,</HI> there can be no Col|li&s;ion betwixt the fir&s;t and la&s;t Creditor, the Rule
<PB N="63" REF="66">
<HI>prior tempore potior jure</HI> will be &s;ufficient to extri|cate the whole.</P>
<P>Taking then the Con&s;ent as a <HI>Preference,</HI> not a <HI>virtual A&s;&s;ignation,</HI> the Method that naturally ca&s;ts up to adju&s;t the&s;e Preferences, appears to be this. Let the Creditors be ranked upon the Subject ac|cording to their <HI>real</HI> Preferences, <HI>A</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>B</HI> in the &s;econd, <HI>C</HI> in the la&s;t. The&s;e are the Places that naturally belong to them in virtue of their Diligences. This Step being taken, it falls next to be con&s;idered, what <HI>partial</HI> Grounds of Pre|ference any Creditor has again&s;t another. In this Ca&s;e, the only partial Ground is the Con&s;ent, whereby <HI>C</HI> is intitled to draw, as if <HI>A</HI> were not in the Field. To adju&s;t this Preference, let us &s;uppo&s;e the Fund 6, and each of the Debts 4; in adju&s;ting the <HI>real</HI> Ranking, <HI>A</HI> draws 4, <HI>B</HI> 2, <HI>C</HI> nothing. <HI>B</HI> keeps his 2; this he is intitled to by the <HI>real</HI> Ranking, not being concerned with the <HI>partial</HI> Preference, that occurs only when the Que&s;tion is betwixt the other two Creditors. Let us next con&s;ider the Effect of this <HI>partial</HI> Preference, which intitles <HI>C</HI> to draw, as if <HI>A</HI> were not in the Field. When this Calculation is made, <HI>C</HI> will be found intitled to draw only 2; &s;o that upon the whole <HI>B</HI> draws 2, <HI>C</HI> 2, and <HI>A</HI> 2.</P>
<P>This appears to be the natural Method for ad|ju&s;ting Preferences among Creditors, who have per&s;onal Challenges or partial Grounds of Pre|ference again&s;t one another. To clear the Mat|ter &s;till further, it will be proper to obviate what Objections may ari&s;e. According to this Method, it is obvious, that <HI>A</HI> the Con&s;enter is in a better Situation, than if <HI>B</HI> were not in the Field; This may appear &s;trange. It may be thought when <HI>C</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="67">
is claiming the Benefit of <HI>A</HI>'s Con&s;ent, that he ought to draw the whole 4, &s;eeing it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for <HI>A</HI> to plead upon the Right of <HI>B;</HI> which he does, when <HI>C</HI> is re&s;tricted to draw only 2. As this indeed &s;eems to have the Air of an Objection, a &s;olid An|&s;wer may tend &s;trongly to inforce this Scheme. To obtain perfect Satisfaction, we need but look into the Circum&s;tances of the Parties, and Nature of the Tran&s;action. <HI>C</HI> about to lend his Money, &s;ees two real Creditors upon the Subject. He is unwilling to lend upon that Security, unle&s;s he ob|tain <HI>A</HI>'s Con&s;ent to his Preference. He &s;ees at the &s;ame Time <HI>B</HI> preferable, but that he takes his Hazard of, he is willing to lend under that Di&s;advantage. All therefore he can pretend to draw, even after <HI>A</HI>'s Con&s;ent, is what remains of the Fund unpre|occupied by <HI>B.</HI> This is all the real Security he has to depend upon, and all he ought to draw in the Divi&s;ion of the Fund or Price thereof. When therefore in the Que&s;tion betwixt <HI>C</HI> and <HI>A,</HI> upon the Con&s;ent, <HI>B</HI>'s Right is brought under Con&s;ideration, it mu&s;t not be taken in this Light, as if <HI>A</HI> were founding any Preference upon it; it is pled upon only to de|termine, how far the Con&s;ent &s;hould operate. The Law &s;ays, That &s;uch a Con&s;ent is not a <HI>virtual</HI> A&s;&s;ignation, it means no more, but to allow the Creditor con&s;ented to, to draw as if the Con&s;enter were not in the Field. To make this Calculation, it is plain, that <HI>B</HI>'s Intere&s;t mu&s;t be taken into Con&s;ideration: And therefore, according to the Example above laid down, when <HI>C</HI> draws 2, all the Fund that remains unpreoccupied by <HI>B,</HI> he draws the whole that was intended him by the Con&s;ent. This Argument is drawn from the Meaning of the Con&s;ent, and it is &s;olid. However, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="65" REF="68">
to give another An&s;wer &s;ufficient to reach all the Ca&s;es of partial Preferences, as well as that by Con&s;ent. And this will ari&s;e from con&s;idering the Nature of the Objection <HI>jus tertii.</HI> In the E&s;&s;ay upon that Subject, it is laid down, <HI>Po&s;ition</HI> VI. That one is ever allowed to found upon the Right of a third Party, when the Conclu&s;ion tends to re|&s;trict or annul the Right of his Antagoni&s;t. Thus, &s;ub&s;tituting an Inhibition in Place of the Con&s;ent, when the third Creditor Inhibiter comes to claim his Preference, he draws ju&s;t 2 as the Right con|&s;ented to did; becau&s;e, all that the Inhibition or Con&s;ent can operate is to &s;trike out <HI>A.;</HI> And when that is done, all that remains to them unpreoccupied by <HI>B</HI> is 2. And tho' <HI>B</HI> him&s;elf draws but 2 in Competition with <HI>A,</HI> yet <HI>A</HI> can found upon <HI>B</HI>'s Right to re&s;trict <HI>C</HI> to 2; &s;ince it is not claiming a Preference upon <HI>B</HI>'s Right, but u&s;ing it as an Ar|gument to re&s;trict <HI>C</HI>'s Right. And truly the Ar|gument is conclu&s;ive. Were <HI>C</HI> allowed to cut out <HI>A</HI> of his whole Claim, without &s;uffering any Re|&s;triction upon Account of <HI>B</HI>'s Claim, it would fol|low, that an Inhibition, which is only under&s;tood a Ground of <HI>Preference,</HI> mu&s;t really and &s;ub&s;tantially be a <HI>virtual A&s;&s;ignation,</HI> &s;o as to put the Inhibiter in the inhibited Per&s;on's Place, and to intitle him to draw, not only in his own Right, but in Right of the Per&s;on inhibited, which is directly contrary to the Nature of an Inhibition.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be urged further upon this Point, Why &s;hould it not be reckoned <HI>jus tertii</HI> for <HI>A</HI> to found upon <HI>B</HI>'s Right, in order to re&s;trict <HI>C,</HI> as well as it is for <HI>C</HI> to found upon <HI>A</HI>'s Right, in order to re&s;trict <HI>B?</HI> Now it <HI>C</HI> could found upon <HI>A</HI>'s Right in order to re&s;trict <HI>B,</HI> the Scheme would come out
<PB N="66" REF="69">
thus. By Means of the Re&s;triction <HI>B</HI> drawing but two, there would remain four unpre-occupied to be drawn by <HI>C.</HI> In An&s;wer to this, let it be con|&s;idered, that the <HI>jus tertii</HI> cannot lie both Ways. If it be <HI>jus tertii</HI> for <HI>C</HI> to build upon <HI>A</HI>'s Right, in order to re&s;trict <HI>B,</HI> it cannot be <HI>jus tertii</HI> for <HI>A</HI> to found upon <HI>B</HI>'s Right, in order to re&s;trict <HI>C;</HI> the&s;e being directly contradictory Po&s;itions; the one ter|minating in a virtual Conveyance, the other only in a Preference, which is the true Conception of the Matter. But more directly the Difference comes preci&s;ely here. <HI>A,</HI> as above laid down, may found upon <HI>B</HI>'s Intere&s;t, to cut down <HI>C;</HI> why? Becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence is to prefer him&s;elf, or, which is the &s;ame, to relieve him&s;elf of a Burden. But to what Purpo&s;e is it that <HI>C</HI> would found up|on <HI>A</HI>'s Intere&s;t? 'Tis true, <HI>A</HI> is preferable to <HI>B;</HI> but no Conclu&s;ion can be drawn from that to <HI>C</HI>'s Advantage, it neither tends to profit <HI>C,</HI> or to relieve him of any Burden. Thus in Competition with <HI>A, B</HI> can only draw two; but it will not follow that four remains for <HI>C,</HI> becau&s;e 'is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, that <HI>B</HI> draw four in Competition with <HI>C,</HI> though he draw only two in Competition with <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>I have cho&s;en the partial Preference that ari&s;es from Con&s;ent, as the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t Ca&s;e, to illu&s;trate and clear this Subject. But what is laid down here will apply to all the other Grounds of partial Preference, Inhibitions, <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> Adjudica|tions, &amp;c. All of which operate a <HI>Preference,</HI> not a <HI>virtual A&s;&s;ignation.</HI></P>
<P>The Rule then comes out thus, fir&s;t to rank all the Creditors according to the Priority of their Dili|gences, without re&s;pecting the partial Grounds of Preference any one may have again&s;t another. By
<PB N="67" REF="70">
this fir&s;t Operation will be a&s;certained the Claims of the&s;e Creditors who &s;tand free of Challenge. In the next Place, to adju&s;t what will fall to any Cre|ditor, in Virtue of partial Grounds of Preference, the Operation mu&s;t go thus. Strike out the Credi|tor again&s;t whom the partial Ground of Preference is directed; what remains of the Fund unpre-occu|pied by the other Creditors not &s;truck at, belongs to the Creditor Obtainer of the partial Preference.</P>
<P>It need hardly be qualified here, that for what is drawn from the fir&s;t Creditor <HI>A,</HI> by Virtue of the Con&s;ent or Inhibition, he cannot recur again&s;t <HI>B;</HI> that would carry this Ab&s;urdity, to make the Inhi|bition or Con&s;ent virtually operate again&s;t <HI>B,</HI> tho' in|tended only again&s;t <HI>A, B</HI>'s Annualrent, &s;econd in the Order of Time, entitles him to take up the &s;econd Place; this is his Situation, let <HI>A</HI> and <HI>C</HI> adju&s;t their Preferences in the be&s;t Shape they can. If <HI>C</HI> thur&s;t out <HI>A,</HI> that entitles not <HI>A</HI> to thur&s;t out <HI>B:</HI> He mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to take up <HI>C</HI>'s Place. But it is proper to be ob&s;erved, That it will make no Difference as to this Scheme, whether the partial Ground of Chal|lenge be con&s;idered as operating a direct Preference, or only a per&s;onal Claim, or Ground of Reducti|on. For, taking the Matter in either Shape, the Creditor who has the Ground of Challenge, mu&s;t &s;till be entitled to draw, as if the Debt again&s;t which the Challenge lies, were not in the Field. This Ob|&s;ervation &s;uper&s;edes intirely the Nece&s;&s;ity as to this Point of di&s;puting, whether an Inhibition give a direct Preference, or be only a Ground of Reducti|on? Which po&s;&s;ibly may be a Que&s;tion not ea&s;i|ly determined from the Nature of that Diligence.</P>
<P>Let us illu&s;trate this Doctrine by another Ex|ample. The fir&s;t we &s;hall give is out of the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="71">
Law. The <HI>&s;pecies facti</HI> is this; a Per&s;on bor|rows Money and for Security gives a Hypotheck, which the Creditor neglects to regi&s;trate. Thereaf|ter the Debitor becomes a Tutor, whereby, by the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, his whole Goods become hypothecated to the Pupil. La&s;t of all he borrows another Sum, and gives another conventional Hypotheck, which the Creditor regi&s;trates. What gives Occa&s;ion to the Difficulty here, is a Con&s;titution whereby con|ventional Hypothecks regi&s;tred, are preferred to the&s;e not regi&s;tred. Whence the unregi&s;tred Hypotheck is preferred to the Legal, and the Legal to the Regi&s;tred by Priorty of Time. (For a legal Hypo|theck need not be regi&s;tred;) the regi&s;tred Hypo|theck again is preferred to the unregi&s;tred. Let us as before &s;uppo&s;e each of the Debts = 4 the Fund = 6. To extricate this, let us fir&s;t adju&s;t the real Ranking. By this Ranking the legal Hypotheck draws 2, not being concerned with the Ground of Challenge that the one conventional Hypotheck has again&s;t the other. All that the regi&s;tred Hypotheck can draw, &s;uppo&s;ing the unregi&s;tred out of the Field is barely 2. The other remaining 2 is left to the unregi&s;tred Hypotheck. This Scheme of Ranking falls in preci&s;ely with the one above-mentioned: And &s;o it ought, becau&s;e the regi&s;tring of <HI>C</HI>'s Hy|potheck has the &s;ame Effect with his Inhibition again&s;t <HI>A,</HI> or <HI>A</HI>'s Con&s;ent to his Preference.</P>
<P>Thus the Matter comes out, where the partial Grounds of Challenge operate a total Preference. The Ca&s;es fall next to be con&s;idered where the&s;e partial Grounds operate only a <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> Prefe|rence, or &s;uch like, which is the Ca&s;e of Adjudica|tions within Year and Day. As for Example, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e <HI>A</HI> to be an Adjudger infeft, <HI>B</HI> an An|nualrenter,
<PB N="69" REF="72">
<HI>C</HI> a &s;econd Adjudger <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the fir&s;t. In this Ca&s;e, it is plain, all the &s;econd Adjud|ger has to depend upon is what remains of the Fund after &s;atisfying the Annualrenter, and that Remain|der too, he mu&s;t lay his Account to &s;hare with all prior Adjudgers, and po&s;terior within Year and Day. He can be in no better Situation than if <HI>A</HI> the fir&s;t Adjudger were po&s;terior to the Annual|renter, or even were the la&s;t Adjudger, but within Year and Day. Whence it follows, That <HI>C</HI> the &s;e|cond Adjudger in this Ca&s;e can draw but half of the free Fund that remains unpre-occupied by <HI>B</HI> the Annualrenter. This Ca&s;e is al&s;o reducible to the former, by taking it in this Light, <HI>A</HI> the fir&s;t Adjudger is preferable to <HI>B</HI> the Annualrenter, and <HI>B</HI> the Annualrenter to <HI>C</HI> the &s;econd Adjudger by Priority of Diligence, <HI>C</HI> the &s;econd Adjudger is preferable to <HI>A</HI> the fir&s;t Adjudger by the Act 1661, not totally indeed, but for the one Half. And ac|cordingly he draws that Half as if <HI>A</HI> the fir&s;t Ajud|ger were not in the Field. To illu&s;trate this by an Example, let us, as formerly, &s;uppo&s;e the Fund = 6, each of the Debts = 4; then <HI>A</HI> draws 4 in Com|petition with <HI>B.</HI> To <HI>B</HI> there remains 2, which he retains in all Events. To <HI>C</HI> again there remains but 2 unpro-occupied by <HI>B,</HI> which at the &s;ame Time he mu&s;t communicate with <HI>A,</HI> upon Account of the <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> Preference. So, upon the whole <HI>A</HI> draws 3, <HI>B</HI> 2, <HI>C</HI> 1.</P>
<P>In this View of the Matter it is taken for grant|ed, That the Act of Parliament bringing in Ajud|gers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> does not give the &s;econd Adjudger all Advantages as if his Diligence were truly of the &s;ame Date with the fir&s;t Adjudgers; &s;uch Fa|vour was &s;urely not de&s;igned. All intended by the
<PB N="70" REF="73">
Act to cut off that Preference, which fir&s;t Adjudgers naturally have by Priority of Diligence; &s;o that it levels the fir&s;t Adjudger's Preference in Competiti|on with a &s;econd, but gives no Privilege to a &s;econd Adjudger in Competition with third Parties.</P>
<P>Having laid down the Rule and Method for de|termining the Preferences among compeating Credi|tors, it will be proper in the next Place to add &s;ome other Examples to the&s;e above &s;et forth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>A</HI> an Annualrenter con&s;enting to <HI>C</HI>'s Preference.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>B</HI> an Adjudger inhibiting before the Contraction of <HI>C</HI>'s Debt.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>C</HI> an Adjudger <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> &s;ubject to <HI>B</HI>'s Inhibiti|on, and preferable to <HI>A</HI> by the Con&s;ent.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Let us continue to &s;uppo&s;e the Fund = 6, each of the Debts = 4.</P>
<P>In adju&s;ting the <HI>real</HI> Preferences, which fall fir&s;t under Con&s;ideration, <HI>A</HI> draws 4, and the two Ad|judgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> each of them draws 1. Next as to the <HI>partial Grounds</HI> of Preference, <HI>B</HI> the Adjud|ger Inhibiter cutting out <HI>C</HI> by Virtue of his In|hibition, mu&s;t draw as he were not in the Field; and &s;o takes 2, which is his ultimate Draught. <HI>C</HI> again mu&s;t draw as <HI>A</HI> were not in the Field, which entitles him to no more but 2, being cut out of the other 4 by the inhibiting Adjudger. The&s;e 2 <HI>C</HI> draws from <HI>A,</HI> and con&s;equently upon the ultimate Divi&s;ion <HI>A</HI> draws 2, <HI>B</HI> 2, and <HI>C</HI> 2.</P>
<P>Let us again &s;uppo&s;e each of the Debts = 5, the Fund continuing = 6. In this Ca&s;e <HI>A</HI> will draw 4, <HI>B</HI> 1, and <HI>C</HI> 1.</P>
<P>Let now each of the Debts be = 6, the Fund continuing = 6. In this Ca&s;e <HI>A</HI> will draw the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74">
Another Example may be drawn from <HI>l.</HI> 16. <HI>Qui potior. in Pign.</HI> A Debitor hypothecates his Fund fir&s;t to <HI>A,</HI> next to <HI>B,</HI> in the la&s;t Place to <HI>C.</HI> In a Competition betwixt <HI>A</HI> and <HI>C, C</HI> is unju&s;tly pre|ferred; but again&s;t this unju&s;t Sentence there is no Appeal entred. <HI>C</HI> is al&s;o preferred to <HI>B;</HI> but up|on an Appeal <HI>B</HI> obtains Redre&s;s. In this Ca&s;e it is demanded, how the Preferences are to be adju&s;t|ed? <HI>A</HI> is preferable to <HI>B,</HI> and <HI>B</HI> to <HI>C</HI> by Priority of Time, <HI>C</HI> again to <HI>A</HI> by the Sentence not appealed again&s;t. This Ca&s;e comes to be the &s;ame with that of three Annualrenters above-mentioned, whereof the la&s;t has an Inhibition again&s;t the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Another Example may be given, which de&s;erves well to be con&s;idered, 1<HI>mo,</HI> An A&s;&s;ignation intimate. 2<HI>do,</HI> An Arre&s;tment interveening betwixt the A&s;&s;ig|nation and Intimation. 3<HI>tio,</HI> An Adjudication whereof the Citation was prior to the Arre&s;tment, but po&s;terior to the Date of the A&s;&s;ignation. The Subject is the Rent of Lands, and the Parties all called together in a Multiple-poinding. Here the Arre&s;tment is preferable to the A&s;&s;ignation. <HI>Stair, T. A&s;&s;ignation,</HI> &sect; 44. The A&s;&s;ignation is preferable to the Adjudication by Priority of Diligence. <HI>Du|rie,</HI> 2<HI>d March</HI> 1637, <HI>Smith</HI> contra <HI>Hepburn.</HI> And the Adjudication again to the Arre&s;tment upon the &s;ame Account. <HI>Forbes,</HI> 26. <HI>June</HI> 1705, <HI>Steuart</HI> contra <HI>Steuart.</HI> How is this Matter to be extricat|ed? Here is a plain direct Circle of <HI>ab&s;olute real</HI> Preferences, founded all upon the &s;ame Medium, which appears to be a plain direct Incon&s;i&s;tence: For it comes to the &s;ame as if <HI>A</HI> &s;hould be made preferable to <HI>B</HI> upon any one Medium, and <HI>B</HI> again preferable to <HI>A</HI> upon the &s;ame Medium. In all the Circles that have hitherto ca&s;t up, different <HI>Media</HI> of
<PB N="72" REF="75">
Preference are brought in to make the Circle. Thus it may readily be, that <HI>A</HI> is preferable to <HI>B, B</HI> to <HI>C</HI> upon one Medium, and <HI>C</HI> again to <HI>A</HI> upon ano|ther Medium; or more &s;hortly, that <HI>A</HI> is preferable to <HI>B</HI> upon one Medium, and <HI>B</HI> to <HI>A</HI> upon another: As for Example, In two Infeftments of Annualrent, whereof the la&s;t has an Inhibition that &s;trikes again&s;t the fir&s;t, <HI>A</HI> is preferable to <HI>B</HI> by Priority of Time, and <HI>B</HI> again to <HI>A</HI> by his Inhibition: But 'tis in|con&s;i&s;tent that two Diligences can be mutually pre|ferable upon the &s;ame Medium, which would in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er this Ab&s;urdity, That from the &s;ame Medium two oppo&s;ite or incon&s;i&s;tent Conclu&s;ions might be drawn. In this Ca&s;e the &s;ame Medium of Preference regu|lates the whole Competition, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> the Priority of At|tachment, or <HI>Nexus realis</HI> upon the Subject. Were this Medium carried &s;teadily through, in comparing the&s;e Diligences with one another, it is impo&s;&s;ible there could be any Difficulty. The Matter becomes inextricable by this alone, that in the Competition betwixt the A&s;&s;igney and Arre&s;ter, the Arre&s;tment is &s;uppo&s;ed to make a <HI>Nexus realis</HI> upon the Subject; whereas in Competition with the Adjudger, the Ar|re&s;tment is &s;uppo&s;ed only to be a <HI>per&s;onal Prohibi|tion</HI> to the Debitor, and con&s;equently no <HI>Nexus re|alis.</HI> No Wonder then, that two incon&s;i&s;tent Sup|po&s;itions in the &s;ame Competition &s;hould bring on an inextricable Circle. To evade this, if it be al|ledged, That an Arre&s;tment is preferable interveen|ing betwixt the A&s;&s;ignation and Intimation, upon a Pre&s;umption of Collu&s;ion betwixt the Debitor and A&s;&s;igney, antedating the A&s;&s;ignation in Order to di&s;appoint the Arre&s;ter. The An&s;wer is ready, 1<HI>mo,</HI> There is no Ground in Law to infer &s;uch a Collu&s;ion with Re&s;pect to a formal Right, &s;olemnly

The Matter therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come out in this Shape, either that Arre&s;tment makes a <HI>nexus realis,</HI> upon which Suppo&s;ition, it mu&s;t be preferable, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, both to A&s;&s;igney and Adjudger; or, that it makes only a <HI>per&s;onal Prohibi|tion,</HI> upon which Suppo&s;ition, both A&s;&s;igney and Ad|judger mu&s;t be preferable to it. That the la&s;t Sup|po&s;ition is the Truth of the Matter, will appear, 1<HI>mo.</HI> From the Nature and Stile of the Diligence. 2<HI>do.</HI> From this indi&s;putable Po&s;ition, That Arre&s;t|ment &s;tops not a po&s;terior Poinding. 3<HI>tio.</HI> From what is above laid down, that a po&s;terior Adjudica|tion is preferable to an Arre&s;tment.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the Competition among Di&s;ponees, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The Rules above laid down will apply equally to the Ca&s;e of Di&s;ponees, as to that of Creditors: There is no other Variety in the Ca&s;es, but that of <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>unlimited.</HI> And even Creditors come frequently to have unlimited Claims; which hap|pen &s;o oft, as the Debt is equal to, or exceeds the Value of the Subject: In which Circum&s;tances they come to be preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame Footing with Di&s;ponees. In Competition among Di&s;ponees, &amp;c. real Preferences, and per&s;onal Grounds of Chal|lenge ca&s;t up the &s;ame Way, as among Creditors: And the Rule mu&s;t equally obtain in both, that the per&s;onal Ground of Challenge is frequently cut
<PB N="74" REF="77">
down, for Want of an Intere&s;t to plead it; &s;o that <HI>jus tertii</HI> does equally regulate both Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>To &s;hew this Connection by an Example, let us &s;uppo&s;e three Annualrenters, of which the la&s;t has an Inhibition again&s;t the fir&s;t. Let the Fund be = 6, and each of Debts = 4. Upon this Suppo&s;ition the Creditors will draw 2 a Piece. But again, let each of the Debts be = 6, and upon this Suppo&s;i|tion, the fir&s;t Annualrenter will draw the Whole, notwith&s;tanding that the la&s;t Annualrenter is prefe|rable to him, by vertue of his Inhibition: Which in this Ca&s;e, it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the la&s;t Annualrenter to in&s;i&s;t upon, the Fund as to him being intirely pre|ocupied by the &s;econd Annualrenter; &s;o that, tho' the third Annualrenter &s;hould prevail in his per&s;onal Challenge again&s;t the fir&s;t, it would avail him nothing.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Annualrenters, let us now &s;ub&s;titute Di&s;ponees, and it is obvious, the Re&s;olution mu&s;t be the &s;ame. The la&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition, tho' &s;upported by an Inhibition, that &s;trikes again&s;t the fir&s;t, cannot prevail. The <HI>jus tertii</HI> lies again&s;t him, in re&s;pect he can have no Benefit by the Challenge, the Fund being already preoccupied by the &s;econd Di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>It is then the <HI>jus tertii</HI> that equally regulates both Ca&s;es; which allows the per&s;onal Challenge to go no further, than the Challenger can &s;hew a Bene|fit thereby. It will readily occur, That among Di&s;ponees, this Bar of <HI>jus tertii</HI> generally excludes the per&s;onal Challenge totally, the Fund being &s;up|po&s;ed already preoccupied by &s;ome third Right, a|gain&s;t which the Challenge lies not: Among Cre|ditors it is generally otherwi&s;e: For the third Right, again&s;t which the Challenge lies not, being limited,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
and for the mo&s;t Part not ab&s;orbing the whole Fund, this of con&s;equence allows the per&s;onal Challenge a <HI>partial</HI> Effect; as may be &s;een in all the Ex|amples above given among Creditors; unle&s;s where the Debt of the interjected Creditor has been equal to the Value of the Fund. And this is the only Variety that does occur, in Application of the a|bove Rules to the Ca&s;e of compeating Di&s;ponees.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to give other Examples upon this Head.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE I.</HEAD>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, 1<HI>mo.</HI> A Death-bed Deed com|pleated, but reducible by the Heir. 2<HI>do.</HI> A &s;econd Death-bed Deed, of the &s;ame Subject, con&s;ented to by the Heir.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Deed cuts out the &s;econd; the &s;econd cuts out the Heir; and the Heir again cuts out the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>To clear this Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, as a Thing taken for granted, that the Heir's Con&s;ent here operates not a <HI>Conveyance</HI> of his Privilege, but barely a Renunciation thereof, with re&s;pect to the Right con&s;ented to. If it did operate a Convey|ance, there could be no Difficulty in the Que&s;tion, becau&s;e upon that Suppo&s;ition, the Reduction would be competent to the &s;econd Di&s;ponee, as well as to the Heir him&s;elf.

1673. <HI>Brown</HI> contra <HI>Nichols.</HI> This Ca&s;e is handled above.</P>
<P>The next Deci&s;ion I &s;hall mention, is the Com|petition among&s;t the Creditors of <HI>Langtoun,</HI> 20. <HI>January</HI> 1709. This being a curious Ca&s;e, and pretty &s;tifly debated, I &s;hall give it at full Length, as ob&s;erved by a very eminent Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Langtoun</HI>'s Affairs having gone into Di&s;order, in the Beginning of the Year 1690; about the Time of his Retiring, he grants many heritable Bonds of Corroboration, whereupon Infeftments followed, be|fore any Adjudications could be expede; and there were al&s;o many Inhibitions, &s;ome older, &s;ome later, before the granting of &s;everal of the&s;e Bonds of Cor|roboration; and the Creditors did all generally ad|judge, within Year and Day. The Debts and Di|ligences did far exceed the Debitor's E&s;tate: Whereupon a Competition of Creditors ari&s;ing, &s;e|veral Que&s;tions did occur, which had never former|ly been determined, e&s;pecially in the Ranking of &s;imple, and inhibiting Adjudgers, and Annualren|ters; which Que&s;tions were pled and determined, without Names of Parties, but upon the Nature of their &s;everal Rights and Diligences.</P>
<P>For the Annualrenters it was alledged, That their Infeftments of Annualrent, being prior to all the Adjudgers, they were preferable, and their Annual|rents payable in the fir&s;t Place, before an Adjudger could draw any Share of the Rents.</P>
<P>And for the Inhibiters, that the Sums in their Inhibitions mu&s;t be fully &s;atisfied before the po&s;te|rior Annualrenters could draw any Share.</P>
<P>And for the &s;imple Adjudgers on Debts anterior to the Inhibitions, that the &s;aid Inhibitions could not be any ways prejudicial to their Debts, but

<PB N="79" REF="84">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="80" REF="85">
that they, as Co-adjudgers with the Inhibiters, ought to draw the &s;ame Share, as if no Inhibition had been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal Propo&s;itions were all &s;everally founded upon known Principles of Law, in ca&s;e of Competition betwixt any two of the three con|tending Parties, but not reconcileable to one ano|ther in the Competition of &s;imple and adjudging Inhibiters and Annualrenters, which was the Ca&s;e that lay before the Lords to be decided.</P>
<P>The Lords after many Hearings <HI>in pre&s;entia,</HI> and very mature Deliberation and Rea&s;oning among&s;t them&s;elves, did, at la&s;t, come to e&s;tabli&s;h certain Rules for determining the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, and the like that might occur in other Proce&s;&s;es of Ranking, which of late had fallen to be more fre|quent, and the Deci&s;ions more accurate, in Re|gard of the late Acts of Parliament, anent the Sale of Bankrupts E&s;tates.</P>
<P>The Rules e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Lords were the&s;e. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That an Inhibiter-adjudger did not &s;imply reduce po&s;terior Annualrenters, but only in as far as the&s;e Annualrenters were prejudicial to the Inhi|biter; And found, That Inhibiters would draw &s;uch a Share of the Rents, or in ca&s;e of Sale of the Property of the E&s;tate, as would have belonged to them, if no po&s;terior voluntary Rights had been granted; And found, That anterior Creditors ad|judging within Year and Day of the Inhibiter, could not be prejudged by the Inhibition, but that ante|rior Creditors adjudging would draw the &s;ame Share of the common Debitor's E&s;tate, as if there had been no Inhibition u&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this Deci&s;ion the Inhibiter did not obtain full Payment of the Sums in the Inhibition before
<PB N="81" REF="86">
the Annualrenter could draw any Share, nor did the Annualrenter lo&s;e all, but a Part only; nor was the Annualrenter allowed to recur upon Ad|judgers for anterior Debts for making up that Share, which the Inhibiter reduced and cut off. As for Example, &s;uppo&s;e the Ca&s;e, That the Sub|ject affected is worth 12000 Merks, and that there are three Adjudgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> for 5000 Merks each, and one Annualrenter effeiring to 6000 Merks, and that one of the Adjudgers is al&s;o an Inhibiter before contracting the Annualrenter's Debt; the Divi&s;ion falls thus. The three Adjudgers for equal Sums, do fir&s;t divide the 12000 Merks in equal Parts, whereof each draws 4000 Merks, and there|by lo&s;e each 1000 Merks; the Annualrenter being a common Burden on the Subject affected, and pre|ferable to all the Adjudications, claims 2000 Merks from each of the three Adjudgers, as a Stock effeir|ing to his Annualrent; but the inhibiting Adjudger &s;trikes off his Claim, by virtue of his Diligence of Inhibition; but the po&s;terior Adjudgers having no Defence, the Annualrenter draws 2000 Merks from each of them, whereby the inhibiting Adjudger gets his full third Share with the Co-adjudgers, but lo&s;es 1000 Merks of his whole Sum, and the An|nualrenter lo&s;es 2000 Merks, and gets 4000 Merks, and the Co-adjudgers get each 2000 Merks of the remaining 4000 Merks.</P>
<P>According to this Rule, the Lords did uniformly determine in all &s;ub&s;equent Rankings and Sales for &s;everal Years; And the Rules are found practicable in all the Variety of Ca&s;es that did occur in the &s;everal Proce&s;&s;es of Sale, which have been very fre|quent &s;ince that Time. But thereafter in the Ca&s;e of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">arridden,</HI> there happened a &s;pecial Circum&s;tance,
<PB N="82" REF="87">
which had not been pled when the Rule was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and &s;ome Alteration had al&s;o happened on the Bench &s;ince that Deci&s;ion; whereupon the whole Foundation of that Rule and Deci&s;ion was called in Que&s;tion, and often debated <HI>in pre&s;entia,</HI> and &s;everal Bills; And after a Review and full Con&s;ide|ration of the Ca&s;e, the Lords did proceed upon the &s;ame Foundation, and &s;trengthned the former Rule.</P>
<P><HI>Carridden</HI>'s Ca&s;e occurred in the Competition of the Creditors of <HI>Cockburnspath,</HI> a Part of <HI>Ni|col&s;on</HI>'s E&s;tate; and he being an Inhibiter, and al&s;o an Adjudger within Year and Day, the Lords found his Adjudication null; But he in&s;i&s;ted as In|hibiter for reducing the Right of &s;everal Debts after his Inhibition, whereon Adjudication had been led within Year and Day of other Adjudgers on Debts anterior, alledging, That he could not be wholly excluded, while the&s;e Adjudgers on po&s;terior Debts were admitted to a Share of the Price; for he could &s;till adjudge, whereby his Adjudication would be drawn back to his Inhibition, and always be preferable to &s;uch Adjudgers, who&s;e Debts were po&s;terior to his Diligence.</P>
<P>To which it was an&s;wered, That his Adjudica|tion could afford him no Share, becau&s;e &s;etting a&s;ide all the po&s;terior Creditors, the Diligences on ante|rior Debts were far beyond the Value of the Sub|ject of the Competition; And &s;eeing his Inhibition could not prejudge the&s;e anterior Debts nor Dili|gences, it afforded no Prejudice to him that po&s;te|rior Creditors by their Diligence came in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> to get a Share with anterior Creditors; becau&s;e, tho' the&s;e po&s;terior Debts had never been contract|ed, <HI>Carridden</HI> was utterly excluded, and his Inhi|bition
<PB N="83" REF="88">
was only a prohibitory Diligence; where|upon he could not reduce po&s;terior Debts &s;imply, but in &s;o far as they were prejudicial to his Debt; and his After-adjudication could not &s;tate him in the Ca&s;e of the&s;e po&s;terior Annualrenters, &s;o as to make the Benefit of their Annualrents accre&s;ce to him.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;everal Debates in that Ca&s;e, the Lords at la&s;t, by their Interlocutor 15th <HI>February</HI> 1698, found, That an Inhibiter cannot be prejudged by po&s;terior Debts, nor anterior Creditors prejudged by an Inhibiter; And found, That the contracting of Debts after an Inhibition could not be profitable to an Inhibiter, nor does their Diligence accre&s;ce to him, and that therefore <HI>Carriden</HI> could draw no Share of the Price of <HI>Cockburnspath.</HI></P>
<P>According to the&s;e Rules, all the Rankings have ever proceeded uniformly without any Contra|diction. But of late in the Competition of the Cre|ditors of <HI>Langtoun,</HI> that Rule was again called in Que&s;tion; And upon a Petition, &s;everal Times moved by the Inhibiters, a Hearing allowed <HI>in pre&s;entia,</HI> in which it was alledged, That the Rule above &s;et down could not con&s;i&s;t with the true Ef|fect of an Inhibition, which was not only a prohi|bitory, but a preparatory Diligence, and that an Adjudication coming after, whether within Year and Day of other Adjudgers or not, was always to be drawn back to the Date of the Inhibition, &s;o as to re|move all po&s;terior Annualrents or other Diligences on po&s;teriorDebts, and the&s;e being removed, the Inhibiter fell to come in to get the full Payment of the Debts in his Inhibition, at lea&s;t to the Extent of the vo|luntary Rights; and then the Annualrenter, being preferable by the Nature of his Right and Security,
<PB N="84" REF="89">
came in the next Place to get the full Payment pre|ferable to po&s;terior Co-adjudgers. As for Example, In the Ca&s;e formerly &s;tated of a Subject to the Value of 12000 Merks, and three Adjudgers for 5000 Merks each, and an Annualrenter effeiring to 6000 Merks; the Annualrenter, as preferable, draws fir&s;t his Share, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> 6000 Merks, which is &s;et a&s;ide; &s;o the remaining 6000 Merks being divided in three, each Adjudger gets 2000 Merks; But the inhibiting Adjudger recurs upon the Annual|renter by virtue of his Diligence, from whom he draws 3000 Merks more to make up his 5000 Merks; then the Annualrenter, by the Nature of his Right being preferable to the Co-adjudgers, re|curs on them, from whom he draws the &s;aid 3000 Merks; &s;o remains only to the Co-adjudgers 1000 Merks.</P>
<P>For inforcing this, the Inhibiter in&s;i&s;ted upon the Nature of the Diligence, alledging, That the Ad|judger's Diligence reach'd nothing but the Rever|&s;ion over and above the Annualrent, which was preferable upon every Part of the Subject adjudged; and therefore the Inhibiter getting his full Share by virtue of his Adjudication and Inhibition, the An|nualrent lay upon the Shares of the Co-adjudgers; and it often happens, that an Inhibiter gets a bet|ter Share, by Rea&s;on of po&s;terior voluntary Rights, than he would have had without them. As for Example, Suppo&s;e that in place of a Right of An|nualrent, a po&s;terior Creditor had obtained either a proper Wad&s;et, or a redeemable Right of a Part of the Debitor's E&s;tate, and being thereupon in|feft was preferable to the po&s;terior Adjudgers, in that Ca&s;e the Inhibiter would have an equal Share with the Co-adjudgers, if within Year and Day;
<PB N="85" REF="90">
and what were wanting would be made up to him by affecting the Wad&s;et or Right of Property made after his Inhibition, wherein the Co-adjudgers would have no Share nor Intere&s;t, and by that Means the full Sum in the Inhibition would be made up, and he in a much better Condition than he would have been, if no po&s;terior Right had been granted. And &s;uppo&s;e again, That this Inhibiter had not ad|judged within Year and Day, he would indeed have had no Share in the Rever&s;ion or Superplus with prior Adjudgers, but his Diligence would have been drawn back to procure to him full Payment of the Sums in his Inhibition, at lea&s;t &s;o far as the Value of the po&s;terior voluntary Right did extend to; And there is no Rea&s;on that the Ca&s;e of an Inhibiter &s;hould be wor&s;e where there is a po&s;terior Annual|rent, than it would be if no proper Wad&s;et or par|tial Right had been granted.</P>
<P>To all which it was an&s;wered, That the Rules above laid down are mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable, and nothing material objected.</P>
<P>The fundamental Rules are, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That an In|hibiter cannot be prejudged by po&s;terior Debts. 2<HI>do,</HI> That an anterior Creditor can no ways be pre|judged by an Inhibition; whereas by what's now pled, an Inhibition would &s;trike more effectually a|gain&s;t the prior Creditor than the po&s;terior Annual|renter; For tho' the Inhibiter recurs upon the An|nualenter as po&s;terior, the Annualrenter recurrs a|gain upon the Adjudgers who&s;e Debts were con|tracted prior to the Inhibition, by which Means the Annualrenter lo&s;es nothing, tho' the Inhibition ought only to &s;trike again&s;t po&s;terior voluntary Deeds, and the Adjudger on prior Debts is at the whole Lo&s;s, albeit it be a mo&s;t certain Principle,
<PB N="86" REF="91">
that an Inhibition has no imaginable Effect again&s;t anterior Debts, and Diligences following thereupon: So that there mu&s;t certainly be a Fallacy in that Rea&s;oning, and there is no Manner of My&s;tery, or the lea&s;t Difficulty in finding where the Fallacy lies, <HI>viz.</HI> an Inhibition is no Ground Reduction of po|&s;terior Debts &s;imply to anull them, but only in &s;o far as they are prejudicial to the Debt in the Inhi|bition, that is to &s;ay, in &s;o far as the Inhibiter falls to draw a le&s;s Share of the E&s;tate or Rents thereof, than he would have obtained if no po&s;terior vo|luntary Deed had been done: And an Inhibition is merely a prohibitory Diligence for removing the Prejudice of po&s;terior Deeds, but does not give any po&s;itive Right, nor &s;tate the Inhibiter Adjudger in Place of the Annualrenter, &s;o as to draw a Share by Virtue of the Right of Annualrent as the In|hibiter mu&s;t acknowledge by his own Argument; for if the Inhibiter came in Place of the Annual|renter, that is to &s;ay, if the Right of Annualrent did accre&s;ce to the Inhibiter, then the Inhibiter getting Payment in the Right of the Annualrent would extingui&s;h the Annualrent, and con&s;equently the Annualrenter could never recur upon the Co|adjudgers. So that the Scheme offered by the Inhi|biters is incon&s;i&s;tent with Law and Rea&s;on in every Circum&s;tance; For the Inhibiter can never have what was competent to the Annualrenter, but by coming in his Place, and cau&s;ing the Annualrent to accre&s;ce, which were a Notion ab&s;urd and incon|&s;i&s;tent. And what's urged, that an Inhibition is not only a prohibitory but a preparatory Diligence, is a new invented Notion never heard of in any former Ca&s;e, and without any Foundation in Law.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="92">
And, whereas it is alledged, That in the Ca&s;e of a proper Wad&s;et, or a partial Right of Pro|perty after Inhibition and before the Adjudications, the Inhibiter &s;trikes out the po&s;terior Wad&s;etter or Purcha&s;er, and comes in his Place; from which 'tis inferred, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That an Inhibiter may have Advantage by po&s;terior voluntary Deeds. 2<HI>do,</HI> What mu&s;t be acknowledged to be in the Ca&s;e of a proper Wad&s;et or an irredeemable Right of Proper|ty, ought al&s;o to hold in the Ca&s;e betwixt the com|peting Annualrenter and Inhibiter,</P>
<P>It is an&s;wered, That in the Ca&s;e propo&s;ed, an Inhibiter may have an accidental Advantage in the Competition with other Creditors by po&s;terior vo|luntary Deeds; For the Inhibiter would not only have a Share with the Co-adjudgers in the Rever&s;ion of the Debitor's other E&s;tate, but further would af|fect the Lands irredeemably di&s;poned or wad&s;et af|ter his Inhibition, but cannot have the like Benefit in the Ca&s;e of an Annualrenter, and it often happens, that by a Competition a greater Benefit ari&s;es to &s;ome Creditors than would do, if &s;ome of the Par|ties competing were out of the Field; becau&s;e in a Competition of many Creditors, there mu&s;t be ge|neral Rules and Foundations in Law with Regard to the Rights and Intere&s;ts of the &s;everal Credi|tors competing, which alter, if the Rights of &s;ome of the&s;e Creditors be drawn out of the Field. As for Example, In the Competition betwixt an Inhi|bition and a po&s;terior voluntary Right without the Concour&s;e of other Creditors, the Inhibition is al-always preferable; but in the Competition of many other Creditors, the Inhibition may happen to be totally excluded, and po&s;terior Rights get a Share.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="93">
To apply this to the Ca&s;e propo&s;ed, a proper Wad&s;etter, or a Right of Property of a Part of the Debitor's E&s;tate, does wholly &s;eparate and &s;et a|part the Wad&s;et Right or the Property from the Debitor's E&s;tate in Competition with po&s;terior Ad|judgers, whereby they are intirely excluded from that Wad&s;et or Right of Property; but <HI>quoad</HI> the Inhibiter, the Wad&s;et or Right of Property is null, and therefore the inhibiting Adjudger removing the voluntary Right by his Inhibition comes to receive the Benefit of the voluntary Right &s;o far as is wanting to him by his Diligence in Competition with Co-adjudgers or other Creditors: Whereof the Rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e &s;uch voluntary Rights do in the fir&s;t Place wholly exclude Adjudgers not In|hibiters, and then the Competition falls &s;ingly be|twixt Inhibiters and po&s;terior Purcha&s;ers; and in the Competition of the&s;e two, the Inhibiter is ever preferred; but that makes nothing to the Advantage of what is now urged to be a Rule in the Competi|tion of &s;imple and inhibiting Adjudgers and An|nualrenters. For,</P>
<P>1<HI>mo,</HI> The po&s;terior Wad&s;etter or Purcha&s;er &s;o excluded does not recur upon the po&s;terior Ad|judgers, but only &s;uffers the Lo&s;s as having re&s;ted upon voluntary Rights without Diligence; and &s;o the Rule above &s;et down, That prior Creditors are not prejudged by the Inhibition, &s;tands &s;till good, whereas in the pre&s;ent Debate it is alledged, That as the Inhibiter recurrs upon the Annualrenter; &s;o the Annualrenter al&s;o recurrs upon Adjudgers and anterior Debts.</P>
<P>2<HI>do,</HI> There is a manife&s;t Di&s;parity betwixt the Ca&s;e of an Annualrenter and a proper Wad&s;etter or Purcha&s;er of a Part of the Debitor's E&s;tate by an

irredeemable Right; for the la&s;t two do intirely di|vide and &s;eparate the Wad&s;et or irredeemable Right from the Remainder of the Debitor's E&s;tate, and thereby does wholly withdraw his Purcha&s;e from the po&s;terior Adjudgers; whereas an Annualrent Right re&s;embles a Servitude, and is a Burden con|&s;i&s;ting with the Property, and affecting every Part thereof; and therefore the po&s;terior Adjudgers carry the Property &s;o affected: And when the&s;e Adjudgers divide the Property or the Rents, the Annualrent which lies as a Burden is equally proportioned a|mong&s;t the Adjudgers according to their Dividend: But that Proportion of the Annualrent which falls upon the Share of the inhibiting Adjudger is &s;truck off, whereby he gets the &s;ame Share that would have fallen to him if there had been no Annualrent, and becau&s;e the &s;aid Share of the Annualrent is cut off by the Diligence of an Inhibition, the Annual|renter is at a Lo&s;s, and cannot recur upon the Ad|judgers who did not inhibit, becau&s;e the Inhibition can no more prejudge anterior Creditors than po|&s;terior Deeds can prejudge the Inhibiter. As for Example, In the Ca&s;e above &s;tated of a Competiti|on for a Stock of 12000 Merks, the three Ad|judgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> for 5000 Merks each get only 4000 Merks, and the Annualrenter effeiring to 6000 Merks, gets 2000 Merks from each of the two Adjudgers who did not inhibit, but draws no|thing from the Inhibiter, as being after his Diligence. And &s;uppo&s;e again, That the Inhibiter were not <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the other two Adjudgers, but Year and Day after them, the&s;e two Adjudgers would fir&s;t draw their full 10000 Merks out of the common Stock, whereby there would remain 2000 Merks to the Annualrenter, and then the Annualrenter would
<PB N="90" REF="95">
draw his other 4000 Merks from the two fir&s;t Ad|judgers which would make up his whole Annualrent, but the Inhibiter who was not within Year and Day would reduce the Annualrent in &s;o far as ex|tended to the 2000 Merks more than fell to the fir&s;t two Adjudgers, becau&s;e tho' the fir&s;t two Ad|judgers were preferable as to their 10000 Merks, and in &s;o far as the Annualrenter draw from them, the Inhibiter was not prejudged, yet as to the Superplus of 2000 Merks, the Competition falling betwixt the Inhibiter and a po&s;terior Annualren|ter, the Inhibiter is intirely preferred. But &s;up|po&s;e again, That there were three Adjudgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> &s;till for 5000 Merks, and an Inhibiter Ad|judger, Year and Day after, for the like Sum, and an Annualrenter as formerly; in that Ca&s;e, the three Adjudgers on anterior Debts would each draw 4000 Merks, and the Annualrenter would draw 2000 Merks from each of them, and &s;o ob|tain full Payment, and the Inhibiter Adjudger not within Year and Day would get nothing, albeit the po&s;terior Annualrenter gets all, as was found in the forecited Ca&s;e of <HI>Carridden,</HI> becau&s;e the Inhibiter is not prejudged by the Annualrenter who can never compete if the Que&s;tion were betwixt them two; but the whole Stock being affected and exhau&s;ted by preferable Adjudications for anterior Debts, the Inhibiter is thereby effectually excluded by his own Negligence and the Diligence of the other Creditors, and is noways prejudged by the Annualrenter who by his Preference to the Co-adjudgers gets his full Annualrent, which the Inhibiter ought not to envy, and can not quarrel the Annualrenter's Advantage, not being in Defraud and Prejudice of him. And thus it happens, that in the Competition of many
<PB N="91" REF="96">
Creditors, the Divi&s;ion being made according to Foundations and Principles of Law, a voluntary Right obtains Preference and Payment, when an anterior Inhibiter is wholly excluded, not by the An|nualenter, but by other competing Creditors; and it is a mi&s;taken Notion of the Import of an Inhibi|tion, to imagine, that an Inhibition gives any po&s;i|tive Right, or that the Inhibiter is prejudged as long as he gets not his full Payment preferrable to po&s;terior Annualrents; for the Effect of his Dili|gence is only that he do not get le&s;s than if the&s;e Annualrents had not been granted, or that in Com|petition with voluntary Rights alone, and without the Intervention of other competing Creditors, the Inhibiter is always preferred to the voluntary Right; But where other Creditors come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> or are preferable to the Inhibiter, and po&s;tponed to the Annualrenter, every Creditor draws his Share ac|cording to the Nature of his Right and Diligence.</P>
<P><HI>The Lords found, That in the Competition of &s;imple and inhibiting Adjudgers and Annualrenters, the inhibiting Adjudger could only reduce the po&s;terior Annualrent, in &s;o far as he was thereby prejudged; and that he could not claim full Payment of the Sums in his Inhibition before the Annualrenter could draw any Share in the &s;aid Competition, but could only draw &s;uch a Share of the Annualrents or Price as he would have drawn, if there had been no po&s;terior Annualrent or voluntary Right.</HI></P>
<P>The E&s;tate of <HI>Tofts</HI> being &s;old at a publick Roup, and the Decreet of Ranking remitted to an Ac|comptant, to draw out a Scheme of the Divi&s;ion of the Price among&s;t the Creditors, an Objection was
<PB N="92" REF="97">
&s;tarted again&s;t the Scheme, to under&s;tand which, the following Fact is nece&s;&s;ary to be known. 1<HI>mo, Su&s;anna Bel&s;hes</HI> had an inhibition in the 1672, and Adjudication upon the &s;ame Ground of Debt in 1685. 2<HI>do, Kippenro&s;s</HI> had an Inhibition in the 1673, with an heritable Bond of Corrobora|tion and Infeftment in the 1679, which Infeftment was &s;truck at by <HI>Su&s;anna Bel&s;hes</HI> her Inhibition. 3<HI>tio,</HI> A Set of Annualrenters, &s;ome prior, &s;ome po|&s;terior to <HI>Kippenro&s;s,</HI> but all of them &s;truck at by his Inhibition. 4<HI>to,</HI> A Sett of Adjudgers in the 1685, coming in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with <HI>Su&s;anna Bel&s;hes</HI> her Adjudication, &s;truck at by neither of the Inhi|bitions To reduce this Ca&s;e to its &s;imple&s;t Terms, and to throw off extraneous Circum&s;tances, <HI>Kippen|ro&s;s</HI>'s Inhibition, and the Effect thereof was fir&s;t con&s;idered; which &s;triking only again&s;t the po&s;terior Annualrenters, the Ca&s;e was taken up, as if the&s;e Annualrenters were not in the Field: And at the &s;ame Time, the Inhibition it&s;elf was laid a&s;ide, it having thus got its full Effect, by throwing out of the Field every Right it &s;truck again&s;t. This being premis'd, the Ca&s;e reduc'd to its &s;imple&s;t Terms came out thus. 1<HI>mo,</HI> An Infeftment of Annual|rent, <HI>&s;oiz. Kippenro&s;s</HI>'s. 2<HI>do,</HI> Po&s;terior Adjudgers coming in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u;</HI> of which Adjudgers, one, <HI>&s;oiz. Su&s;anna Bel&s;hes,</HI> has an Inhibition that &s;trikes again&s;t the Infeftment of Annualrent.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is, How are the&s;e Creditors to draw their Proportions? The Annualrenter is rank|ed <HI>primo loco;</HI> and the Inhibiter, without doubt, draws from him whatever &s;he could draw, were he not in the Field. So far the Matter is clear. But now the Di&s;pute comes, Can the Annualrenter re|cur again&s;t the other Adjudgers again&s;t whom the
<PB N="93" REF="98">
Inhibition &s;trikes not for any Share of what was drawn from him by the Inhibition? The Scheme &s;ays No; the Objector &s;ays Yes.</P>
<P>To go to the Foundation of this Matter, it mu&s;t be carefully attended to, that an Inhibition is in it|&s;elf no <HI>real</HI> Right, gives no Preference in the Sub|ject, not being directed again&s;t the Land but again&s;t the competing Creditors, &s;uch of them as it &s;trikes again&s;t. In a Word, being but a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Prohibi|tion directed again&s;t Creditors, it affords only a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Challenge, which does not alter or di&s;turb the <HI>real</HI> Preferences.</P>
<P>For Example, If there be three Annualrenters, <HI>A, B, C,</HI> following one another in the Order of Time, and ranked accordingly: Let us &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>C,</HI> the la&s;t Annualrenter, has an Inhibition &s;triking again&s;t <HI>A,</HI> the fir&s;t Annualrenter. Let the E&s;tate be 800, and the Value of each of the Annualrent Rights 400: In this Ca&s;e the Method of drawing can be no other but this. <HI>A,</HI> the fir&s;t Annualrenter, is pre|ferred <HI>primo loco,</HI> and draws his whole Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> 400. By which his Annualrent-Right falls to be ex|tingui&s;hed by Payment. <HI>B,</HI> the &s;econd Annual|renter, draws all that remains, being other 400. And thus &s;o far as concerns the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> Pre|ferences, <HI>C,</HI> the la&s;t Annalrenter, is cut off, and draws nothing. But then when we go to con&s;ider the Pretences, that one Right or Diligence may have again&s;t another, which my Lord <HI>Stair</HI> terms, <HI>Page</HI> 649, <HI>The partial Rea&s;ons of Reduction;</HI> we find that <HI>C</HI> has an Inhibition again&s;t <HI>A,</HI> and there|fore mu&s;t draw from him whatever he would have drawn by Vertue of his Annualrent-Right, had <HI>A</HI> never exi&s;ted, which is no le&s;s than his 400. And thus the ultimate Divi&s;ion comes out. <HI>B</HI> gets 400,
<PB N="94" REF="99">
<HI>C</HI> gets 400, and <HI>A</HI> gets nothing. Now in this Ca&s;e the Objector mu&s;t &s;ay, that <HI>A</HI> recurs again&s;t <HI>B</HI> for what was drawn from him by the Inhibiter, which lands in giving <HI>C</HI> 400, <HI>A</HI> 400, and <HI>B</HI> nothing. And he comes at this Conclu&s;ion by con|ceiving <HI>C,</HI> by Virtue of his Inhibition, preferable in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>A</HI> in the &s;econd Place, and <HI>B</HI> in the la&s;t Place, which is plainly fallacious. 1<HI>mo,</HI> Be|cau&s;e an Inhibition, as &s;aid is, gives no <HI>real</HI> Prefe|rence. 2<HI>do,</HI> Becau&s;e it is evident, let <HI>A</HI> and <HI>C</HI> ad|ju&s;t their Preferences, as they be&s;t can, that <HI>B,</HI> the &s;econd Annualrenter, again&s;t whom the Inhibition &s;trikes not, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;econd Place. So that if we &s;hall allow <HI>C,</HI> by Vertue of his Inhibition to take up the fir&s;t Place naturally due to <HI>A,</HI> that cannot harm <HI>B. A</HI> being thus beat out of his Place, cannot di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>B,</HI> but mu&s;t upon that Sup|po&s;ition fall back to the la&s;t Place. And were this otherwi&s;e, great Ab&s;urdities would follow. Ac|cording to the Objector's Scheme, as was ju&s;t now demon&s;trated, the E&s;tate being 800, and each of the Annualrents 400, <HI>C,</HI> the Inhibiter, draws his whole Claim, <HI>A</HI> his whole Claim, and <HI>B</HI> gets nothing at all. What is this but to &s;ay, that the Inhibiti|on excludes <HI>B,</HI> tho' it has no Cau&s;e of Reduction again&s;t it, and pre&s;erves <HI>A,</HI> tho' it is again&s;t <HI>A</HI> on|ly that it &s;trikes.</P>
<P>There is another Ca&s;e which tends much to illu|&s;trate this Doctrine. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a Liferentrix who, having the preferable Right upon the E&s;tate, con&s;ents to the Preference of another Creditor, which Wives are frequently led to do. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, at the &s;ame Time, a third Creditor who has an Infeftment of Annualrent interjected betwixt the Liferent-Right and the Right con&s;ented to. 'Tis plain that the
<PB N="95" REF="100">
<HI>Con&s;ent</HI> here alters nothing of the <HI>real</HI> Preferences. The Liferentrix falls to be ranked <HI>primo loco,</HI> the o|ther Creditor <HI>&s;ecundo loco,</HI> and the Right con&s;ented to <HI>ultimo loco.</HI> And in that Order they mu&s;t draw their re&s;pective Proportions, and the E&s;tate of Con|&s;equence be disburdened. The Right indeed rank|ed in the la&s;t Place, by Vertue of the Con&s;ent, mu&s;t draw from the Liferentrix whatever it would have drawn, had the Liferentrix not been in the Field. But &s;ure this could never intitle the Liferentrix to recur again&s;t the Annualrent ranked in the &s;econd Place, who&s;e Right the Con&s;ent harms not. As to him, the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> is <HI>res inter alios,</HI> which can nei|ther hurt him or do him Service. The Foundation of Law is preci&s;ely the &s;ame in the Ca&s;e of Inhibiti|on. The Effect of which is re&s;tricted again&s;t the Creditors which it &s;trikes at; and in no Ca&s;e can either harm or benefit others.</P>
<P>All this is to clear the Method of making out Schemes in Rankings, which has been continually practi&s;ed and followed ever &s;ince the Vi&s;count of <HI>Stair</HI>'s Time, who was the fir&s;t that fixed this Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>real</HI> Rights mu&s;t fir&s;t be ranked according to their Preference; and having drawn their Sums accordingly, the E&s;tate falls to be di&s;|burdened of them, and they extingui&s;hed by Pay|ment. In the next Place mu&s;t be con&s;idered the partial <HI>Preten&s;ions</HI> or Rea&s;ons of Reduction that any of the Creditors may have again&s;t others. As to &s;uch the Rule is,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whatever is drawn from a preferable Creditor upon any per&s;onal Con&s;ideration, intitles him not to recur again&s;t any other preferable Creditor po&s;terior to him, a|gain&s;t whom the per&s;onal Con&s;ideration militates not."</Q> See, <HI>Stair Page</HI> 649 at the Foot.</P>

To apply all to the Ca&s;e in di&s;pute, which is that of an Annualrenter, and two po&s;terior Ad|judgers, one of which has an Inhibition &s;triking a|gain&s;t the Annualrenter; my Lord <HI>Stair</HI> in the a|bove cited Place, has well fixed that the Annual|rent-Right mu&s;t be ranked fir&s;t, and the Adjudica|tions in the &s;econd Place <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u.</HI> Then he con|&s;iders the Effect of the Inhibiter's <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Claim again&s;t the Annualrenter, but allows not the An|nualrenter at all to recur again&s;t the other Adjudger for what was drawn from him by the Inhibition, which were landing in the above Ab&s;urdity, no le&s;s than allowing the Annualrenter, when he is beat out of his own Place, to take up the &s;econd Place, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s thereby the Adjudger, who&s;e Place by Right it is, whereby the Inhibition would come to &s;trike again&s;t the Adjudger, and not again&s;t the An|nualrenter, in expre&s;s Contradiction to the Intend|ment of the Diligence, which the Law &s;ays, in this Ca&s;e, &s;trikes only again&s;t the Annualrenter and not again&s;t the Adjudger. Now here the Objector would have the inhibiting Adjudger to be ranked in the fir&s;t Place, and thereby to take up the Place of the Annualrenter, becau&s;e the Inhibition &s;trikes a|gain&s;t him. He would have the Annualrenter &s;truck out of his own Place, to take up the &s;econd Place po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Adjudger, and he would &s;end the &s;econd Adjudger thus unju&s;tly di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t, to &s;eek his Redre&s;s off the fir&s;t Adjudger, in the be&s;t Man|ner he can, which is evidently contrary to the Nature of the Thing, and the Conception of the&s;e Diligences.</P>
<P>To &s;um up all, when <HI>Kippenro&s;s</HI> pleads upon his Inhibition, no doubt it mu&s;t have its Effect, and thereby mu&s;t be &s;truck out all the po&s;terior Infeft|ments

of Annualrent. In the next Place, when he pleads upon his Infeftment, he has a Title to be ranked for his whole Sum, he is accordingly rank|ed and draws his whole Sum; and thus his Infeft|ment has al&s;o its full Effect. There is indeed a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Claim upon him by Vertue of an Inhibiti|on, which takes from him &s;ome Share of his Draught: But this <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Claim, the other <HI>real</HI> Creditors have no Concern with; as to them 'tis plainly <HI>res inter alios</HI> they cannot be le&s;ed thereby.

<P>The Lords found, That <HI>Kippenro&s;s</HI>'s Infeftment being once ranked, &s;o as to draw his Share in Com|petition with the other <HI>real</HI> Creditors; that he could not recur again&s;t the po&s;terior <HI>real</HI> Creditors for any Part of what was drawn from him by <HI>Su&s;anna Bel&s;hes</HI> her Inhibition,&mdash;<HI>Feb.</HI> 1730. <HI>Campbell</HI> contra <HI>Drummond.</HI></P>
<P>In a reclaiming Petition, the Objector again&s;t the Scheme endeavoured to turn his Argument into another Shape, he pled according to the Rule laid down by Lord <HI>Stair, Page</HI> 649, &sect; 28. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Adjudgers are to be accounted as joint Pro|prietars, and the Infeftments of Annualrenters as Servitudes on the Property."</Q> Whence he drew this Con&s;equence, That as it is the Property of an Annualrent-right to affect every Part of the Ground
<PB N="98" REF="103">
<HI>in &s;olidum,</HI> in which <HI>unaquaequa gleba &s;ervit,</HI> there|fore it was in <HI>Kippenro&s;s</HI>'s Power to draw his whole Sum out of the &s;imple Adjudger's Part; and he behoved &s;o to do, becau&s;e he was barred by the In|hibition from any Demand upon the inhibiting Ad|judger. But the An&s;wer was obvious to the Lords. 1<HI>mo,</HI> That this Argument went upon a Fallacy; &s;uppo&s;ing each Adjudger to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a different Tenement, without any Connexion or Relation to one another, and the Annualrent a Burden upon both: Whereas the Subject was but one, and the Adjudgers had each of them a Right over the whole <HI>pro indivi&s;o.</HI> Attending to this, the Objectors Argument falls to the Ground, becau&s;e, before there could be any Acce&s;s to make a Partition of the Land it&s;elf, or the Price coming in its Place, be|twixt the two Adjudgers; all the Burdens upon the joint Property mu&s;t have been con&s;idered and paid off, &s;o as to leave the Remainder clear to be divid|ed equally betwixt the Adjudgers. 2<HI>do, E&s;to</HI> the Scheme &s;hould be framed in this Way which the Objectors &s;eems to point at, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> fir&s;t to divide the common Subject betwixt the two Adjudgers, joint Proprietars: To be &s;ure the next Thing to be done was to divide the common Burdens al&s;o; by which Means, no more but the one Half of the An|nualrent would fall to be a Burden upon the &s;imple Adjudger. 'Tis true, this could not limit the Annualrenter's Right who might notwith&s;tanding draw his whole Sum from the &s;imple Adjudger. But then the &s;imple Adjudger, who had not only paid his own Share of the Annualrent-right, but al&s;o that Share which by the Divi&s;ion was laid up|on his Co-adjudger, would without Controver&s;y be intitled to <HI>Recour&s;e</HI> again&s;t the Co-adjudger, as

having paid a Debt which he, the Co-adjudger, was ultimately liable in. And this brings it back preci&s;ely where it was before, by the other Method of Calculation. And indeed it would be ab&s;urd, that two Schemes both right, occa&s;ioned only by taking up the Matter in different Lights, &s;hould terminate in different Conclu&s;ions.

<P>_AS Man is not formed complete in him|&s;elf, but an indigent Being, &s;tanding in Need of daily Supplies from without; The Deity has be&s;towed the Earth up|on Man, and Men upon one another.

But as Mankind grew numerous, and the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life not &s;o ea&s;ily come at, Labour and Indu&s;try became of Va|lue, and PROPERTY to be con&s;idered: For without Property, Labour and Indu&s;try was in vain. The Foundation of Property <HI>a po&s;teriori</HI> is apparent; that it is al&s;o founded <HI>a priori</HI> in the Nature of
<PB N="101" REF="106">
Man, and con&s;equently in the original Laws, is al&s;o certain. Evident from this, that Nature, which makes nothing in vain, has provided every Per&s;on with an AFFECTION to Property, wherein is found|ed that Connection betwixt Men and Things, which we call commonly by the Name of PROPERTY, and whereby Nature prompts a Man to be diffe|rently <HI>affected</HI> to one Thing from another; and which Affection leads us to be&s;tow Care in pre&s;erving, Labour and Indu&s;try in improving what we thus con&s;ider as our own; and frequently enhances the Value of it in our Imagination above Reality, and above the Value we attribute to any other Thing that does not &s;tand with us in that Relation. This AFFECTION is as much founded in Nature as that we bear to our Children, or any Affection whatever. And the De&s;ign is admirable: for 'tis this Affection that is the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of all that Indu&s;try and Diligence Men be&s;tow upon their Af|fairs. Providence fore&s;aw Appropriation nece&s;&s;ary, and it fitted us with <HI>Affections</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> lead|ing to that End. And thus PROPERTY is founded <HI>a priori</HI> in the Nature of Man, or, which is the &s;ame, in the ab&s;tract Laws of Nature: The ab|&s;tract Laws, relating to whatever Species of Beings, being nothing el&s;e but the Regulations their Na|tures and Con&s;titution prompt and direct them to govern them&s;elves by.</P>
<P>PROPERTY being thus founded in the Law of Na|ture, there are MEANS of acquiring and lo&s;ing it, founded al&s;o in the &s;ame Law.

The Affection of Property exerts it&s;elf; and during that Time the Thing is as much his as ever. His Attempts prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, Hope lo&s;es Ground, he de&s;pairs. By Degrees his Lo&s;s wears out of his Mind. His Affection cools, and at la&s;t evani|&s;hes. He lo&s;es intirely the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Property. Thus the Matter lies over for many Years. My Po&s;iti|on is, That the Connection betwixt the Man and his Jewel is by tho&s;e Means as throughly di&s;&s;olved, as if he had derelinqui&s;hed it by the mo&s;t po&s;itive Act, or as if it had never been his.

The natural Affection increa&s;es by Time to this paternal Inheri|tance, which has been now in the &s;ame Family, if you will, for &s;everal Centuries. At la&s;t the for|mer Proprietor comes, and claims the Ground, he &s;hows after what Manner his Predece&s;&s;ors were led to for&s;ake their Country and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. During all that Interval they had been abroad in another Land, where they fixed their Heart and Re&s;idence, without the lea&s;t View or Pro&s;pect of ever revi&s;it|ing their native Soil, till by &s;ome Accident, like the former, Fortune led them back to the Country from whence they originally &s;prung. Let any Man con|&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly this Ca&s;e, and con&s;ult his own Heart about it, he will find this Claim to be again&s;t Na|ture and Rea&s;on. The Demand has no other Foun|dation but a <HI>quondam</HI> Property, long ago de&s;erted, and given over for lo&s;t. 'Tis directed again&s;t a

Per&s;on who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors have been <HI>bona fide</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Time out of Mind, and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed them&s;elves truly Proprietors. A Demand of this Kind is obviou&s;ly again&s;t Nature. The fir&s;t Propri|etor de&s;erted his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t his Affection to it, whereby as to all real Effects the Ca&s;e comes to be the &s;ame as it had never been his. Another Per&s;on is &s;uffered peaceably and hone&s;tly to take up the de&s;erted Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: He has no Rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;pici|ous of this, more than of any other vacant Spot of Ground. His Affection grows to the Subject as his own Property; it becomes as &s;trong as he had bought it, nay, we may &s;uppo&s;e he actually bought it, or obtained it by &s;ome other the mo&s;t indi&s;puted Title. If the Law thereafter take it from him, it takes it from a Man, who cannot help thinking it unju&s;tly tore from him, and who is thereby made a real Sufferer, to be given to another who&s;e Pre|ten&s;ions are quite wore out by Cour&s;e of Time; and who is thus made <HI>locupletior aliena jactura.</HI> It can never be in the Law of Nature to indulge &s;uch Hard&s;hips. It will be granted to be perfectly agree|able to humane Nature, that a Man indulge his Af|fection in &s;uch Acqui&s;ition. At fir&s;t indeed, 'tis rea&s;onable to have &s;ome Doubts; the&s;e mu&s;t wear off nece&s;&s;arily by the Cour&s;e of Time, till at the long Run, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or acquires the mo&s;t &s;olid Affection to, and Security in the Thing as his own. After &s;o good a Foundation built in humane Nature, it ne|ver can be agreeable to the <HI>Laws</HI> of that Nature, to overturn &s;uch a Foundation, by wre&s;ting the Property from him; which were in other Words to &s;ay, That Na|ture dictates to be &s;ecure, and in&s;ecure at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>The Matter comes here in one Word, the longer a Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>bona fide,</HI> the greater is
<PB N="105" REF="110">
his Security in the Thing, and Affection to it, till at length both become extreme. The Laws of Na|ture ought to protect every Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in rea&s;onable Se|curity and Affection, which are of Nature's Growth, and not prefer him who has neither Security nor Affection. And thus by the Law of Nature, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A long continued <HI>bona fide</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is a good Title for acquiring Property."</Q></P>
<P>It will conduce to the better illu&s;trating of this Doctrine, if we take a View of the Effects of <HI>bona fide</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in its full Extent. The <HI>bona fide</HI> Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or from the very Beginning is allowed to con|&s;ume the Fruits. The true Proprietor, let him put in his Claim when he will, has no Demand upon that Score. The Rea&s;on is, That as Property is introduced for the Conveniency and Support of Mankind, 'tis better any Man con&s;ume the Fruits than that they be lo&s;t to every Body: And there|fore are given to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who has a Title &s;uch as to convince the Judges, that he was in <HI>bona fi|de</HI> to con&s;ider him&s;elf as Proprietor. And as from the Nature of the Thing, Titles to Property are ex|tremely uncertain, 'tis the Intere&s;t of Mankind, that they be keeped &s;ecure again&s;t After-reckonings of this Nature. 'Tis but enlarging this Thought to give Security to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, after great Length of Time, in the Thing it&s;elf, when the former Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or has lo&s;t his Affection, and all Thought of Re|covery. For is not all this an&s;wering the true De|&s;ign of Property, by making it &s;ub&s;ervient to the U&s;es and Nece&s;&s;ities of Mankind? Are not the&s;e very Laws anent Property, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> That it cannot be taken away without Con&s;ent of the Owner, and &s;uch like, introduced for the &s;ame I nd, tho&s;e very Laws that &s;een mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to this Doctrine?

But what is the Re&s;ult of all? None other but this, That the End is the true Touch&s;tone to judge of the Preference of the Means.

<P>Pre&s;cription nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;es two Per&s;ons, one who lo&s;es, and another who gains thereby. This is evident; for all the Ways known in Law to de|prive a Man of any of his Rights and Privileges are in Favours of, and with a View to the Intere&s;t of others. Pre&s;cription is of two Kinds, the PO|SITIVE, whereby is gained a Power over the Pro|perty or Per&s;on of another; the NEGATIVE, whereby one lo&s;es his own Rights or Privileges. To determine what Rights fall under the negative Pre&s;cription by the Law of Nature, it is obvious, in the fir&s;t Place, That it is a legal Extinction of Rights of Property, which go thereafter to the fir&s;t Occupier. 2<HI>do,</HI> All Burdens upon the Per&s;on, or Effects of another fall under it, which operating an Extinction only, not a Transference, &s;tand in Need of no po&s;itive Act of the Acquirer of his Liberty, to produce the full Effect; becau&s;e if the Creditor's Right fall, the Debitor cannot remain bound. But as to all Acts of native Liberty, per&s;onal Privileges,
<PB N="107" REF="112">
and &s;uch like, which in benefiting our&s;elves inter|feir not with others, and make no Re&s;traint upon them, &s;uch cannot be lo&s;t by Di&s;u&s;e, becau&s;e they involve but the Idea of one Per&s;on, and concern not others, whereby &s;uppo&s;ing them capable to be cut off by Pre&s;cription, &s;till it would come to nothing, becau&s;e no Mortal could be founded in an Intere&s;t to alledge upon it, the per&s;onal Objection of <HI>jus tertii</HI> would ever lie again&s;t him. Thus, if a Per|&s;on &s;hall keep Silence a hundred Year, confine him|&s;elf to a Place, or to a certain Method of Action, there is nothing in Nature to oblige him to con|tinue a Moment in the &s;ame, longer than he wills, unle&s;s another by U&s;e, Con&s;ent, or otherwi&s;e, has acquired a Power over him to re&s;train his native Liberty. 'Tis for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that a Man cannot tie him&s;elf down, even by the mo&s;t expre&s;s Con&s;ent, unle&s;s declared in Favours of &s;ome third Party. Thus then Rights pre&s;cribe only negatively, which involve the Con&s;ideration of two Per&s;ons. But there is here a remarkable Limitation, which makes a con&s;iderable further Re&s;triction upon Rights pre&s;cribable; which is, That <HI>per&s;onal Powers</HI> or <HI>Fa|culties,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Faculties to burden, to alter</HI> or <HI>in|novate, to revoke,</HI> &amp;c. though inferring a <HI>Burden</HI> upon others, are not lo&s;t <HI>non utendo.</HI> The true and adequate Rea&s;on whereof is this, that it being in|volved in the very Idea of a <HI>Faculty,</HI> to be exerced <HI>quandocunque</HI> at the arbitrary Plea&s;ure of the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, as well now as afterwards, as well afterwards as now, <HI>Neglect</HI> or <HI>De&s;ertion,</HI> the Cau&s;es operative of Pre&s;cription, can never be inferred &s;imply from Forbearance. In <HI>Rights</HI> the very De&s;ign of which is to be made effectual <HI>quam primum,</HI> &s;uch as Obli|gations for Money, or other Pre&s;tation, Forbear|ance
<PB N="108" REF="113">
to act upon the&s;e, implies <HI>Neglect</HI> and <HI>Dere|liction.</HI> But where it is the very Intention of the Thing, that the Matter &s;hould lie over, where it is intirely arbitrary, whether the <HI>Power</HI> be exerced this Day or hereafter, the forbearing to act at pre&s;ent cannot infer in the Nature of Things <HI>Neglect</HI> or <HI>Dereliction.</HI> The&s;e Limitations upon the negative Pre&s;cription, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> Acts of per&s;onal Liberty, that imply but one Per&s;on, and Faculties of the Nature to be exerced <HI>quandocunque,</HI> are both of them gene|rally comprehended under the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>res merae facultatis,</HI> though very different in their Natures and carefully to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. As for the <HI>po&s;i|tive Pre&s;cription,</HI> all Rights may be acquired there|by that are capable of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis obvious, that <HI>po&s;itive Pre&s;cription</HI> can in no Ca&s;e exi&s;t without the <HI>Negative;</HI> for it is through <HI>Neglect</HI> and <HI>Dereliction,</HI> that the po&s;itive Pre&s;crip|tion gives any Man Power over the Effects or Per|&s;on of another. But the negative Pre&s;cription may well &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, and work its whole Effect with|out Intervention of the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. Thus Property is lo&s;t negatively <HI>non utendo;</HI> and if the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription, it is a &s;trong Confirmation of his Title, but not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The proper Subjects therefore of the po&s;i|tive Pre&s;cription are <HI>Servitudes per&s;onal</HI> or <HI>real,</HI> whereby Re&s;traint is impo&s;ed upon Per&s;ons or their Effects, which can by no Means be done by the negative Pre&s;cription alone.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary to lay down the Principles of the Law of Nature relating to this Matter; which will &s;erve to guide us in the Ambiguities of our own Law, as well as where it is totally deficient.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="114">
Having explained the Doctrine of Pre&s;cription, as founded in the Law of Nature: Before we come clo&s;s to our own Practice, it may be proper to pre|mi&s;e, that, be&s;ides the above Con&s;iderations, there are many others &s;ufficient to have influenced our Law-givers to introduce a Statute of this Nature. Nothing more conduces to the Well-being of a So|ciety, than that private Property be fix'd and a&s;cer|tained. It tends to quiet the Minds of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and encourages Indu&s;try, which of all Things ought to be mo&s;t cheri&s;hed. Be&s;ides it cuts off in a great Mea&s;ure a Sort of Pleas pernicious above every Thing to Society, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> &s;uch as are the Re&s;ult of Forgery, Fraud, and under-hand Dealing. Such Claims be|ing generally laid over upon the Pro&s;pect, that by Length of Time, the proper Means of Di&s;covery &s;hall be evani&s;h'd, or the real Exceptions compe|tent again&s;t them be forgot. Taking then Pre&s;crip|tion in all the&s;e different Views, it is &s;o far from be|ing odious, that perhaps there never was a Con&s;titu|tion better founded, whether it be con&s;idered in the View of Equity or Expediency. The Expedi|ency is apparent. The Equity is clearly &s;hown above, &s;ince the indulging of old forgotten Claims comes truly to this, Making the Claimant <HI>locuple|tior aliena jactura.</HI> And 'tis extremely curious to ob&s;erve in this Ca&s;e, as well as in many others, how common Sen&s;e and the Dictates of Nature get in&s;en&s;ibly the better of fal&s;e Principles imbib'd by Reading or Education. In all our Authors it is held and allowed, that Pre&s;cription is odious; yet our Court of Se&s;&s;ion has been in the con&s;tant U&s;e of extending, rather than limiting the Statutes thereanent. And at this Day, as we &s;hall &s;ee after|wards, 'tis e&s;tabli&s;hed in Practice, that many
<PB N="110" REF="115">
Things fall under Pre&s;cription, which have no Sort of Warrant from the Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>Tho' Pre&s;cription be founded in the Law of Na|ture, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that no preci&s;e Time is fixed to it by that Law. This is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure arbitrary, left to the Regulation of every different Society for it &s;elf. Our Law, with great Judgment, has fix'd upon forty Years. A &s;horter Time might po&s;&s;ibly have been reckon'd too great a Limitation upon Proprietors. A longer Time was unnece&s;&s;ary; for exceeding the ordinary Memory of Man, in that Re&s;pect it is equivalent to the longe&s;t Duration. And the Man, who during &s;uch an Extent of Time neglects or overlooks his Affairs, would probably reap little Benefit from a longer Indulgence.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that our Statutes or Practicks have much receded from the Law of Nature, ex|cept in one particular Pre&s;cription of Rights of Property. By the Law of Nature, the negative Pre&s;cription is as effectual to cut a <HI>Proprietor</HI> out of his Right as a <HI>Creditor:</HI> Yet without a po&s;itive Pre|&s;cription, &s;ince the Effect would be to make the Subject <HI>caduciary,</HI> to go to the Fisk or fir&s;t Occu|pier, our Law, favouring the <HI>quondam</HI> Proprietor, allows him to take it up <HI>quandocunque,</HI> as long as not appropriated by the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. And thus, with us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is no &s;uch Thing as a nega|tive Pre&s;cription of Rights of Property ab&s;tracted from the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription."</Q></P>
<P>'Tis commonly held, that in our Law <HI>bona fides</HI> is not a Requi&s;ite of the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. The Lord <HI>Stair</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in <HI>Act</HI> 1617, there is no Provi&s;ion concerning the Manner of the Entry, whether it be <HI>bona fide,</HI> peaceable or lawful?"</Q> &sect; 19. <HI>h. t.</HI> If this be ab&s;olutely fixed in our
<PB N="11" REF="116">
Practice, there's an End of the Que&s;tion. If not, the following Con&s;iderations may not be quite im|pertinent. 1<HI>mo,</HI> If <HI>bona fides</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to the Na|ture of Pre&s;cription, as has been fully laid down above; it mu&s;t ever be under&s;tood included, unle&s;s where expre&s;ly excluded. 2<HI>do,</HI> In this very Act 'tis virtually, if not expre&s;ly included. For to what other End is a Title by Charter and Sa&s;ine made e&s;&s;ential, if not to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>bona fides?</HI> Let a Man examine &s;eriou&s;ly all the Rea&s;ons for Pre&s;cription political and legal, and he &s;hall not be able to point out any other View the Legi&s;lator could have in making a Title nece&s;&s;ary to Pre&s;cription. This will be more plain, when we take a View of the <HI>Roman</HI> Law. There a <HI>ju&s;tus titulus,</HI> ab&s;tracting from <HI>bona fides,</HI> was reckoned a Requi&s;ite of the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription, as much as it is with us. Yet when we come to examine that Matter to the Bot|tom, it will appear, that <HI>ju&s;tus titulus</HI> was truly no di&s;tinct Requi&s;ite of Pre&s;cription; That it was only &s;o far con&s;idered, as to make Evidence of a <HI>bona fides;</HI> and that where there was otherwi&s;e Pre|&s;umption or Evidence of <HI>bona fides,</HI> Pre&s;cription was &s;u&s;tain'd, without any Title at all. All this is clear from the Authority of <HI>Africanus,</HI> one of the be&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, <HI>l.</HI> 11. <HI>pro emptore.</HI> His Words are, <HI>Quod vulgo traditum e&s;t,</HI> Eum, qui exi&s;timat &s;e quid emi&s;&s;e, nec emerit non po&s;&s;e pro emptore u&s;ucapere: <HI>Hactenus verum e&s;&s;e ait, &s;i nullam ju&s;tam cau&s;am ejus erroris emptor ha|beat.

one erroneou&s;ly conceiving him&s;elf Heir, pre&s;cribes a Right to the Heritage by <HI>Addition.</HI> In this Ca&s;e <HI>u&s;ucapio</HI> proceeds upon <HI>bona fides,</HI> without any Colour of a Title. See <HI>Voet, T. pro heredere,</HI> &sect; 2. If then it come out that in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, the <HI>ju&s;tus titulus</HI> is truly no di&s;tinct Requi&s;ite of Pre|&s;cription more than it is in the Law of Nature; Why &s;hould we go about to e&s;tabli&s;h it as the only Principle, when our Law &s;ays no &s;uch Thing, to degrade the <HI>bona fides,</HI> in Sub&s;erviency to which the <HI>ju&s;tus titulus</HI> ought alone to be con&s;idered. 3<HI>tio,</HI> The Ca&s;es ju&s;t now mentioned from the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, without Controver&s;y, would equally obtain in our Practice, The <HI>U&s;ucapio pro herede,</HI> particu|larly is e&s;tabli&s;hed by expre&s;s Statute, <HI>P.</HI> 1617. <HI>C.</HI> 13. and the Pre&s;cription limited to 20 Years. Here then by Authority of Parliament, we have the <HI>bona fides</HI> made the Foundation of Pre&s;cription, without the lea&s;t Pretence of a Title. What can be an&s;wered to the&s;e Examples, by tho&s;e who hold that a Title is nece&s;&s;ary, and not <HI>bona fides?</HI> 4<HI>to, Bona fides</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary <HI>ad lucrandos fructus perceptos ex re aliena:</HI> Would it not be ab&s;urd to adjudge the Property to a <HI>mala fide</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who at the &s;ame Time is in &s;o unfavourable a Situation in the Eye of Law, as even to be made accountable for the Fruits long ago con&s;umed? 'Tis a common Ca&s;e to indemnify a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or as to the Rents, who at the &s;ame Time is made to re&s;tore the Property: So much le&s;s favourable is the one Claim than the other. But it would be &s;trange indeed to &s;u&s;tain a Title as &s;ufficient to retain the Property, which is not even &s;ufficient to retain the Fruits already con&s;um'd. This la&s;t Argument I acknowledge ap|pears to me in a very &s;trong Light. However, if it
<PB N="113" REF="118">
appear not &s;o to others, I &s;hall be the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed in that they have a Support from the <HI>Roman</HI> Law. See <HI>l.</HI> 48. &sect; 1. <HI>A. R.

Sure I am, the cool and diligent Enquirer, who, in Search after Truth, u&s;es his own Rea&s;on, and the Lights that Nature has afforded him, is more to be commended, and offers a more agreeable Incen&s;e to the Memory of the great Men who write upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, tho' in his Judgment he may &s;ometimes argue them of little Slips and Errors, than the abject Mind does, which blindly follows where-ever they chu&s;e to lead. So much was ne|ce&s;&s;ary by Way of Apology, for venturing to &s;et up private Judgment, again&s;t publick and indeed, generally &s;peaking, &s;o well founded Authority. But to return to my Subject.</P>
<P>Here we have a notable. Difference in our Law betwixt the negative and po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. <HI>Bo|na fides</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in the one, not at all in the other. Obligations are lo&s;t, merely by Di&s;u&s;e and Dereliction, without Nece&s;&s;ity of alledging a <HI>bona fides</HI> in the Debitor, or any Thing &s;imilar to a po&s;itive Pre&s;cription of Liberty. For tho' the former Proprietor is re&s;tored again&s;t the Fisk, the Creditor is not re&s;tored again&s;t his Debitor; becau&s;e <HI>Liberation</HI> is as much more favourable than <HI>Obliga|tion,</HI> as private Property is more favourable than Confi&s;cation. This explains the Deci&s;ion, <HI>Fountain|hall,</HI> 7th <HI>December</HI> 1703, <HI>Napier</HI> contra <HI>Campbell,</HI> where it was found, That after the 40 Years Pre|&s;cription
<PB N="114" REF="119">
the Defender was not obliged to give his Oath, whether the Debt was yet re&s;ting owing; and tho' he &s;hould confe&s;s it, that he was not in <HI>foro humano</HI> liable. Po&s;&s;ibly it were to be wi&s;h'd, we had deviated from the Law of Nature in the negative Pre&s;cription of <HI>Obligations,</HI> as far as we have done in the negative Pre&s;cription of <HI>Property. Bona fides</HI> is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in the Acqui&s;ition of Property by Pre&s;cription, without which the former Proprietor is not cut out by whatever Di&s;|u&s;e. Might it not be thought as rea&s;onable, that the Debitor &s;hould not be re&s;tored to his Liberty, unle&s;s by a <HI>qua&s;i</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Exemption upon a <HI>bona fide</HI> colourable Title. And were this made the Rule, the negative Pre&s;cription would be as &s;trong|ly founded in Equity, as it is in &s;trict Law. 'Tis a great Hard&s;hip to oblige a Man to pay a Debt he never was con&s;cious of, having ab&s;olute Affection and Security upon the Side of Freedom: 'Tis no Hard&s;hip to refu&s;e Action to a Creditor, who had perhaps never con&s;idered him&s;elf as &s;uch, and never built Hope in the Claim.

<P>The po&s;itive Pre&s;cription may be defined, <HI>A le|gal Acqui&s;ition of Property or Servitude, by Means of a forty Years</HI> bona fide <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> qua <HI>Proprietor, or</HI> qua <HI>having a Right to the Servitude: Join'd with a total Di&s;u&s;e or Neglect of the righteous Owner during that Time.</HI> The negative Pre&s;crip|tion is, <HI>A legal Extinction of the Creditor's Intere&s;t, by</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="120">
<HI>Means of a total Di&s;u&s;e or Dereliction for forty Years.</HI></P>
<P>Every temporary Extinction of a Right is not Pre&s;cription: That is only under&s;tood to be Pre&s;crip|tion, which extingui&s;hes Rights de&s;ign'd by the Law or Con&s;ent to endure a longer Time. Thus the <HI>annus deliberandi,</HI> the three Years Preference given the Creditors of the Defunct, the Legal of Adjudications, and &s;uch like, fall not within the Compa&s;s of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>The negative Pre&s;cription is not a <HI>real</HI> Extinction like Payment, but only a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Exclu&s;ion of the Pur&s;uer, being an <HI>extrin&s;ick</HI> not <HI>intrin&s;ick</HI> Exception. This is plain from its Nature, being directed again&s;t the Pur&s;uer's Negligence; and therefore can only amount to a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Exception again&s;t him. Thus in an Adjudication, or other Right di&s;poned to two different Per&s;ons, one after another, the negative Pre&s;cription may run again&s;t one of them, tho' the Adjudication it &s;elf be &s;aved from Pre&s;cription, by the other Di&s;ponee. 26. <HI>November</HI> 1728. <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> contra <HI>Mackenzie.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Principle depends the Re&s;olution of the following Que&s;tions. An unintimate A&s;&s;ignation lies over 40 Years; Pre&s;cription has run again&s;t the Ce|dent, but interrupted <HI>quoad</HI> the A&s;&s;igny by Mino|rity.

<P>The &s;ame Principle determines the Que&s;tion, as to the Pre&s;cription of <HI>acce&s;&s;ory</HI> or <HI>cautionary</HI> Oblige|ments. Here we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt an addi|tional Security &s;trictly <HI>acce&s;&s;ory,</HI> or <HI>&s;ub&s;idiary,</HI> and an <HI>expromi&s;&s;ory</HI> Security, <HI>i. e.</HI> the acceding of a new <HI>principal</HI> Obligant. In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch &s;trictly acce&s;&s;ory Obligements can have no Self|&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by whatever Means the <HI>principal</HI> Obli|gation is cut off, its Shadow the <HI>Acce&s;&s;ory</HI> falls of Cour&s;e: But when &s;everal Co-obligants bind at different Times, for the &s;ame Debt, every &s;everal Co-obligant will be free, by a &s;everal Cour&s;e of Pre|&s;cription; for Pre&s;cription is not like Payment, an Extinction of the Debt it &s;elf, operating only an <HI>extrin&s;ick</HI> Exception <HI>per&s;onal</HI> again&s;t the Pur&s;uer.</P>
<P>From this Principle it al&s;o follows, That Pre|&s;cription is not of the Nature of a <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> in|ferring, that the Debt is extingui&s;hed, by Payment or otherwi&s;e, which &s;ome hold: For in the above Ex|ample, <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> contra <HI>Mackenzie,</HI> if the Adjudication were pre&s;um'd extingui&s;hed, by Payment or Intromi&s;|&s;ion, in the fir&s;t Di&s;poner's Per&s;on; this would ne|ce&s;&s;arily affect the &s;econd Di&s;ponee, becau&s;e an Ad|judication extingui&s;hed, by Payment in one A&s;&s;igny's Per&s;on cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the Per&s;on of any other. There is a &s;econd Argument to evince this: Pre|&s;cription has &s;uch an Effect again&s;t the Pur&s;uer's Claim, that it cannot thereafter be reared up, by the Debitor's Oath of Knowledge, that it is &s;till re&s;ting owing. Does not this evince, That Pre&s;crip|tion is not a Pre&s;umption at all, whether <HI>juris &amp; de</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="122">
<HI>jure,</HI> or <HI>juris</HI> only? For 'tis obvious, That every legal Pre&s;umption, however &s;trong, mu&s;t yield to a demon&s;trative Proof, by the Debitor's Oath. There is &s;ome better Colour for putting the po&s;itive Pre|&s;cription upon the Footing of a <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI> The Narrative of the Act &s;eems to favour this: But as Pre&s;cription is &s;upported, by the Law of Nature, it has a more &s;olid Fundation, than a <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> a Creature of the Law, in this Ca&s;e, no better than a Fiction.</P>
<P>It goes next in order, to con&s;ider what Things fall under the negative Pre&s;cription. 1<HI>mo.</HI> It is plain, from the two Statutes, <HI>P.</HI> 1469. <HI>C.</HI> 28. and 1617. <HI>C.</HI> 12. joined with the Nature of Pre|&s;cription, above laid down, that all Burdens, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>Things,</HI> pre&s;cribe <HI>non u|tendo,</HI> &s;uch as Obligations, mutual Contracts, In|feftments of Annualrents, Wad&s;ets, Servitudes, Di&s;|po&s;itions, Adjudications, &amp;c. All of which in|clude the <HI>Idea</HI> of two Per&s;ons, one who lo&s;es his Right, and another who is thereby freed from a Claim or Burden. In a Que&s;tion upon this Head, it was found &s;ufficient to exempt the Defender's Lands, from the Juri&s;diction of a Regality, that he had been free for the Space of 40 Years, never being inrolled, or cited by the Bailie, but &s;till by the She|riff. <HI>Stair</HI> 23. <HI>November</HI> 1671. <HI>Rolland</HI> contra Laird of <HI>Craigievar.</HI> It was al&s;o found, That the Power of Repledging, from one Court to another, was lo&s;t <HI>non utendo,</HI> by the negative Pre&s;cription. <HI>Fountainhall</HI> 29. <HI>January</HI> 1712.

And if they did, it would be <HI>jus tertii</HI> to found upon it. Thus the Right of Blood never pre&s;cribes.

The Man cannot be accu&s;ed of Negligence, who wad&s;et his Lands Ye&s;terday, for not redeeming them to Day, or to Morrow. To oblige him to redeem them pre&s;ent|ly, under the Hazard of Pre&s;cription, would be going directly contrary to the Nature and De&s;ign of the Contract. Yet this &s;eems to be laid down, Parliament 1617. <HI>Cap.</HI> 12. Unle&s;s it be referred to the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription; which Interpretation is founded, both in the Nature of the Thing, and in the Act it &s;elf. For if Rever&s;ions be regi&s;tred, or incorporated within the Body of the Infeftment, the Act in this Ca&s;e &s;ays, they never can pre&s;cribe. Now it appears ob|vious, That this does only relate to the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. There is good Rea&s;on, that Rever|&s;ions incorporated or regi&s;tred &s;hould be good again&s;t the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription; and the &s;ame Rea&s;on will infer, that latent Rever&s;ions ought not: But no
<PB N="119" REF="124">
good Rea&s;on can be given, if latent Rever&s;ions pre|&s;cribe negatively, why they &s;hould not al&s;o, tho' made ever &s;o publick. Neglect and Dereliction are the Foundations of the negative Pre&s;cription, and they mu&s;t hold equally in both Ca&s;es, to infer the nega|tive Preicription, or they mu&s;t hold in neither, which is the more rational Scheme.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, a Donation betwixt Man and Wife may be revoked at any Time; and the Power of Revocation &s;uffers not the negative Pre|&s;cription. <HI>Fountainhall</HI> 15. <HI>January</HI> 1697. <HI>Turn|bul</HI> contra <HI>Husband.</HI> Upon the &s;ame Footing it is, That the Power to take Infeftment upon a Precept is not lo&s;t by Delay; which while the Party is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands, or Superiority thereof, may <HI>ad libitum</HI> be done <HI>quandocunque.</HI> 4. <HI>July</HI> 1716. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> of <HI>Corhead</HI> contra <HI>John&s;ton</HI> of <HI>Newtoun.</HI></P>
<P>In mutual Contracts, Pre&s;cription can have no &s;uch Effect, as to liberate the one Party, while the other remains bound: If the one demand Performance, he mu&s;t fulfil al&s;o his Part; Becau&s;e Pre&s;cription does not change the Nature of Contracts, by tran&s;|forming them into other Species; it cuts them off &s;imply, or allows them to &s;tand &s;imply. Now as the Nature of a mutual Contract is <HI>one</HI> and <HI>indivi|&s;ible;</HI> to oblige the one Party to perform, while the other is free, would be intirely to change its Na|ture, by transforming it into a <HI>&s;imple</HI> Obligation, which Pre&s;cription cannot do, being made to <HI>de|&s;troy,</HI> not to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> Obligations. Thus in a Con|tract of Sale, for Example, which has lien over 40 Years without Implement, but keeped alive by the one Party, thro' Minority or Interruption, if the Party, again&s;t whom Pre&s;cription has not run, in&s;i&s;t for Implement, he mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time perform the

mutual Cau&s;e; becau&s;e if he pur&s;ue upon the Con|tract, he mu&s;t take it as it &s;tands. But then the Pre&s;cription has this Effect, that the other Party can|not pur&s;ue upon it, becau&s;e, as to him, it is lo&s;t <HI>non utendo.</HI> And thus Pre&s;cription may run again&s;t one Party in a mutual Contract, and not again&s;t the other; but never &s;o as to divide the Pre&s;tations; the Contract mu&s;t be fulfilled <HI>in totum,</HI> or not at all.</P>
<P>'Tis commonly held, That a Right of Peerage does not &s;uffer the negative Pre&s;cription: But of this there may be a Doubt. It cannot be put upon the Footing of a <HI>per&s;onal Quality,</HI> &s;uch a one as no Per&s;on has an Intere&s;t to object Pre&s;cription again&s;t; becau&s;e the fir&s;t Peer being removed, the &s;econd in order attains the fir&s;t Place. 'Tis true, Peerage is not a Burden upon any Per&s;on or Thing; but nei|ther is Property; and yet by the Law of Nature, it &s;uffers the negative Pre&s;cription: Our Law indeed, <HI>in favorem,</HI> re&s;tores the former Proprietor to his Right; but that Favour cannot be pled in this Ca&s;e, more than in that of a Creditor: There is no Rea&s;on for re&s;toring one Peer again&s;t another, more than for re&s;toring a Creditor again&s;t his Debitor. It can|not be put upon the Footing of a <HI>Faculty,</HI> to be ex|erced <HI>quandocunque.</HI> A Right of Peerage is of the Nature to be capable of Neglect and Dereliction, as well as a Right of Property, or of Credit. <HI>La&s;t|ly,</HI> Tho' <HI>jus &s;anguinis</HI> pre&s;cribes not, which might be reckoned of the &s;ame Nature with this in Que|&s;tion, that holds only, where it is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for any Mortal to make the Objection; no Per&s;on ha|ving an Intere&s;t to hinder an Heir to repre&s;ent whomever of his Prdece&s;&s;ors. If the Right taken up by the Heir be of the Nature of an Obligation, the <HI>quondam</HI> Debitor &s;uffers nothing, becau&s;e he is

already free, by the negative Pre&s;cription; if a Right of Property, the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is &s;afe, by the po|&s;itive Pre&s;cription; and if that be not run, the Heir has Acce&s;s upon a &s;eparate <HI>medium,</HI> to wit, That Property pre&s;cribes not negatively; if it be a per&s;o|nal Faculty, that interfeirs not with others, or if it be of that Nature to be exerced <HI>quandocunque</HI> there is nothing to hinder the Heir to take it up.

<P>Reduction upon the Head of Death-bed was found to &s;uffer the negative Pre&s;cription. <HI>Forbes</HI> 18. <HI>March</HI> 1707. <HI>Murray</HI> contra <HI>Irving.</HI> But in that Deci&s;ion, Mention is not made of what Nature was the Subject di&s;poned upon Death bed. If it was an heritable Bond, there can be no Que&s;tion about the Deci&s;ion; for this Rea&s;on, that the Heir could have no Intere&s;t to pur&s;ue &s;uch a Reduction again&s;t the Di&s;ponee, who&s;e Right again&s;t the Debitor him&s;elf was cut off <HI>non utendo:</HI> And if the Di&s;ponee took a Document upon the Right, and &s;aved it from Pre&s;cription, that cannot benefit the Heir; but if the Heir him&s;elf u&s;ed Interruption, there is a Diffi|culty, which re&s;olves into this, Whether a Death-bed Deed be <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> null, or good until it be challenged by Reduction? If the la&s;t, the Reduc|tion pre&s;cribes <HI>non utendo:</HI> If the other, the Sub|ject remained <HI>in haereditate jacente;</HI> and there could be no Nece&s;&s;ity of a Reduction. If now the Di&s;|po&s;ition upon Death-bed was of Lands, the &s;ame Di&s;tinction mu&s;t be taken along; for upon Suppo&s;i|tion the Death-bed Deed was good until Reduction, it follows, That the Reduction is cut off, by the negative Pre&s;cription; if null, as a Right of Pro|perty

<P>The negative Pre&s;cription of annual Pre&s;tations is a Subject ab&s;tru&s;e in it&s;elf, and not at all clear'd by Writers or Deci&s;ions. To avoid the Labyrinth the&s;e naturally lead us into, it will be the be&s;t Way to ab&s;tract from them for the pre&s;ent, and endea|vour to draw our Conclu&s;ions from well founded Principles. To begin, we ought nicely to di&s;tin|gui&s;h among&s;t four Things. 1<HI>mo,</HI> The Contract, or other legal Deed which is the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and where|by the Right is e&s;tabli&s;hed. 2<HI>do,</HI> The Writing, which is the <HI>Evidence.</HI> 3<HI>tio,</HI> The <HI>Right</HI> it &s;elf e|&s;tabli&s;hed. 4<HI>to,</HI> The Con&s;equences of the Right. For Example, in a Loan of Money, the Fact of De|livery of the Sum lent to the Debitor with his Con|&s;ent to repay is the <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> The BOnd is the <HI>Evi|dence.</HI> There is a <HI>Right of Credit</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed; the Con&s;equences are, 1<HI>mo,</HI> A Power to oblige the De|bitor to repay the Sum <HI>quandocunque.</HI> 2<HI>do,</HI> A Power to oblige him to pay Annualrent in the mean Time. Of the&s;e four 'tis the Right it&s;elf that is the proper Subject of Pre&s;cription. 'Tis obvious, that <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> or <HI>Evidence</HI> are not capable of Pre|&s;cription. And as for the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of the Right, if the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf remain firm and un&s;ha|ken, its Con&s;equences are a Shadow that mu&s;t ever attend the Sub&s;tance. If the Right it&s;elf fall, 'tis bootle&s;s to talk whether the Con&s;equences be pre|&s;cribed, &s;ince a Shadow cannot exi&s;t without the Sub&s;tance. Having gained this Point, that the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf is the proper Subject of Pre&s;cription, let us now put the Ca&s;e of a Sum of Money lent, repayable at two different Terms; the Creditor in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ts for Payment forty Years after the fir&s;t Term's
<PB N="123" REF="128">
Payment fell due, but within forty Years of the &s;e|cond Term. <HI>Quaeritur,</HI> Whether the remaining Half that fell due the &s;econd Term, can yet be ex|acted? The An&s;wer is, That it cannot, becau&s;e the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf, the <HI>jus crediti</HI> is cut off by Pre|&s;cription; after which there can be no Pur&s;uit upon the Bond. The Creditor has been negligent for the Space of forty Years, &s;ince the Time that Acti|on was fir&s;t competent thereupon, the Law from this infers, that he has derelinqui&s;hed his Right, which brings him to the &s;ame Situation as it ne|ver had been granted; the Right it&s;elf falls with all its Con&s;equences. Upon the &s;ame Medium it is, that a Bond bearing Annualrent having lien over forty Years, not only the principal Sum, but all the intermediate Annualrents fall to the Ground, tho' none of them have been due forty Years, and po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ome of them not a &s;ingle Month. Thus the Matter was determined in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, and up|on the &s;ame Principles. See <HI>L.</HI> 26. <HI>C. de U&s;ur.</HI> The Words are, <HI>Eos, qui principali actione per exceptio|nem triginta, vel quadraginta annorum, &s;ive per&s;o|nali, &s;ive hypothecaria ceciderunt [jubemus] non po&s;&s;e &s;uper u&s;uris, vel fructibus praeteriti temporis ali|quam movere quae&s;tionem, dicendo ex ii&s;dem tempo|ribus eas velle &s;ibi per&s;olvi, quae non ad triginta, vel quadraginta praeteritos annos referuntur, a&s;&s;eren|do &s;ingulis annis earum actiones na&s;ci:</HI> principali <HI>enim actione non &s;ub&s;i&s;tente, &s;atis &s;upervacuum e&s;t &s;uper u&s;uris, vel fructibus adbuc judicem cogno&s;cere.</HI> From the &s;ame Principle it flows, that if a Credi|tor take Document upon his Right, the <HI>Right</HI> it|&s;elf is &s;afe from Pre&s;cription with all its <HI>Con&s;equen|ces;</HI> which is in&s;inuated in the fir&s;t Act anent Pre|&s;cription, and cleared by Practice. Thus negative

Pre&s;cription is &s;aved as to the whole, the Creditor doing Diligence again&s;t any one of the Principals or Cautioners. <HI>Stair, Dirleton,</HI> 18<HI>th December</HI> 1667, <HI>Nicol&s;on</HI> contra Laird of <HI>Philorth.

<PB N="125" REF="130">
and the quite contrary found. Upon this rea&s;on|ing, that though Payment either of the Principal or Annualrent, does interrupt Pre&s;cription of a Bond as to the principal Sum; yet the Annualrent be|ing <HI>annua prae&s;tatio,</HI> every Year does infer a di&s;tinct Obligation, and every di&s;tinct Year's Annualrent does pre&s;cribe by forty Years Silence: So that the Payment of the &s;ub&s;equent Annualrent, or a Part of the Principal, does not interrupt the Pre&s;cription of any &s;ingle bygone Year's Annualrent, if there was no Pur&s;uit upon that Year's Annualrent during the Cour&s;e of Pre&s;cription. I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that this is ju&s;t Rea&s;oning. The Error &s;eems to lie here, that every Year's Annualrent is con&s;ider|ed as a di&s;tinct <HI>principal</HI> Obligation, not <HI>depending</HI> upon, or <HI>con&s;equential</HI> to the Right whereby the principal Sum is e&s;tabli&s;hed; whereas it is as di|rect a <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of the Right of Credit, as the Penalty is, or any other <HI>acce&s;&s;ory</HI> Stipulation. To try this rea&s;oning, let us examine where it will car|ry us. The Obligation for Annualrent is a di|&s;tinct <HI>principal</HI> Obligation; therefore it is not in|terrupted by Document taken upon the Right for the principal Sum. Therefore, 2<HI>do,</HI> Of nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence it pre&s;cribes not with the principal Sum, but has its own &s;eparate Pre&s;cription. And &s;o though a Bond be cut off by a forty Years Ne|gligence, all the Annualrents within the forty Years may yet be demanded, expre&s;ly contrary to the above Text of the Civil Law, founded in the mo&s;t &s;olid Principles. To &s;um up this Di&s;pute, the whole comes here, if Annualrent be a di&s;tinct <HI>principal in|dependent</HI> Obligation, it mu&s;t have a &s;eparate Pre|&s;cription from that of the principal Sum, whereby the principal Sum may be pre&s;cribed while the by|gone

Let us further illu&s;trate this Matter by the Con&s;ideration of a Tack, which though containing mutual and different Pre&s;tations, both as to Kind and Time, is yet one Contract, one Right in the Contracters. The Matter then comes here; if the Right it&s;elf be cut off by Pre|&s;cription, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> the Legacy or Contract, the annual Pre&s;tations flowing therefrom, and depending upon it, mu&s;t cea&s;e of Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>To &s;ift this Matter to the Bottom, being of Importance, let us examine what further may be &s;aid in Favours of this Di&s;tinction betwixt the Pre&s;cription of Annualrents, and other yearly Pre&s;tations, inferred from comparing the&s;e two Laws of the <HI>Codex</HI> together. If it be contended to ly here, that the <HI>principal</HI> Sum falling, the <HI>acce&s;&s;ory</HI> Annualrent cannot &s;tand; whereas, in other annual Pre&s;tations, there is no <HI>principal</HI> Obligation to which they may be referred as <HI>Acce&s;&s;ories,</HI> but each Pre&s;tation is a &s;eparate <HI>Principal.</HI> The An|&s;wer is, It is true, that after the <HI>principal</HI> Sum is extingui&s;hed, no Annualrents can begin to exi&s;t. But as to the Annualrents due before the Pre&s;crip|tion run out, there is no &s;uch Connection as to infer, that they mu&s;t fall, becau&s;e the <HI>Principal</HI> falls. The &s;olid Rea&s;on is, that there is a <HI>Right</HI> in the Creditor antecedent in the Order of our Ideas to the re&s;pective Claims of both <HI>Principal</HI> and Annual|rent, from which <HI>Right</HI> the&s;e Claims flow, are
<PB N="129" REF="134">
Con&s;equences of, and depend upon. To <HI>claim</HI> is to <HI>act,</HI> and all legal Action pre&s;uppo&s;es a <HI>Right</HI> in the Actor, which makes it legal. 'Tis this <HI>Right</HI> which &s;uffers the negative Pre&s;cription; and it being done away, there is nothing left to &s;upport a Claim either for Principal or Annualrent. The very &s;ame Way in other annual Pre&s;tations, a Bond of Pen&s;ion, for Example, there is an ante|cedent <HI>Right,</HI> that &s;upports every re&s;pective Year's Claim, which being extingui&s;hed, the&s;e Claims mu&s;t all fall at once. If it be alledged, That every Year's Claim ari&s;es from a &s;eparate independent Right, which ari&s;es annually; let it be con&s;idered, that Time alone cannot make a <HI>Right</HI> to exi&s;t. If it did not exi&s;t before, it cannot begin now by the Force of Time alone. The Pen&s;ion is <HI>one,</HI> ari&s;ing from <HI>one</HI> Con&s;ent, one Act of the binding Faculty. Even as much as a Right to a Sum bear|ing Annualrent is <HI>one,</HI> or a Right of Pa&s;turage, or to oblige a Per&s;on <HI>ad factum pre&s;tandum,</HI> which re|quires a Cour&s;e of Time to Performance: Or even as a Right of Property, which involves many Powers and Pre&s;tations, differing in Kind as well as Time. To &s;how that a Bond of Pen&s;ion is one Right, tho' containing the Performance of many Years, Let us con&s;ider the Difference betwixt that Ca&s;e, and a different Bond for every Year's Pen&s;ion re|newed annually. In the la&s;t Ca&s;e a Right ari&s;es and falls every Year, and all the different Bonds are quite independent and unconnected; whereas in the other Ca&s;e a Right aro&s;e upon Sub&s;cription of the Bond, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted equally and uniformly through all the Years it was de&s;igned to la&s;t, and fell not until running out of the la&s;t Year. 2<HI>do,</HI> If &s;uch a Pen&s;ion be not allowed to be one Right, it
<PB N="130" REF="135">
will be difficult to &s;how that one Year's Pen&s;ion is one Right, which is equally divi&s;ible as 100 Years are, into Months and Days, and &s;o on to <HI>infi|nitum.</HI></P>
<P>To fortify this, let us apply to the natural No|tions of Mankind, whether they are not apt to con&s;ider a Right obtained by one Con&s;ent in one Deed, as <HI>one?</HI> Whether of judging of one's own Ne|glect, he does not take it from forbearing to pur&s;ue upon the <HI>Deed</HI> the <HI>Contract,</HI> without dreaming to di&s;tingui&s;h the particular Pre&s;tations therein?</P>
<P>Thus as to the negative Pre&s;cription of annual Pre&s;tations, the&s;e two Conclu&s;ions appear to be well founded. 1<HI>mo,</HI> That the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf falling by Pre|&s;cription, it mu&s;t fall with all its <HI>Acce&s;&s;ories</HI> and <HI>Con&s;equences.</HI> 2<HI>do,</HI> That any Document taken upon the Right, according to Act 1469, <HI>C.</HI> 28. as it does pre&s;erve the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf, &s;o of Nece&s;&s;ity it mu&s;t pre&s;erve all the <HI>Acce&s;&s;ories</HI> and <HI>Con&s;equences.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto of annual Pre&s;tations, where the Right it&s;elf is pre&s;cribable. There remains &s;till behind another Branch to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> where the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf is not pre&s;cribable, which is the noted Ca&s;e of Teind, Feu-duty, &amp;c. In this Ca&s;e, tho' the Right it&s;elf fall not by Di&s;u&s;e or Dereliction, yet it is our con&s;tant Practice to cut down the Bygones preceeding 40 Years. Thus, I &s;ay, &s;tands our Law; but if one &s;hall go accurately to inquire into the Rea&s;on, it will not be found &s;o obvious. The Footing, I apprehend, it is generally taken upon, is, That every Year's Pre&s;tation is a <HI>different</HI> Right, which of Con&s;equence mu&s;t have a <HI>different</HI> Cour&s;e of Pre&s;cription. But this, I acknowledge, I never could conceive; and that it is a wrong Conception
<PB N="131" REF="136">
of the Matter, is pretty fully explained above. 'Tis obvious in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, tho' the Pre&s;tations ari&s;e annually, yet there mu&s;t be a <HI>Right</HI> antecedent in the Order of our Ideas, which &s;upports each of the&s;e Pre&s;tations, and upon which each Year's Claim is founded; which <HI>Right</HI> is as much <HI>unicum &amp; in|dividuum,</HI> as any Right can be that &s;upports but one &s;ingle Performance. To take a clo&s;er View of this in the Matter of Teinds, in which indeed every Year's Pre&s;tation bids as fair for being a <HI>di&s;tinct Right</HI> as any one that can be exemplified. 'Tis obvious in the fir&s;t Place, That Vicarage-Teind has never been taken upon that Footing, otherwi&s;e it could never &s;uffer a total negative Pre&s;cription, which it unque&s;tionably does: And 'tis plain, that Par&s;onage-Teind is as much <HI>jus unicum &amp; indivi|duum,</HI> as Vicarage. 2<HI>do,</HI> Par&s;onage-Teind is ap|parently con&s;idered as <HI>jus unicum &amp; individuum,</HI> without which it could never be carried by the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription. Were it otherwi&s;e, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Par&s;onage-Teinds for 40 Years might well ex|clude a Demand for Bygones, upon the Footing, that the <HI>Fructus</HI> are <HI>bona fide percepti &amp; con&s;umpti;</HI> but could give no Right for Time to come, becau&s;e no Right can be carried by Pre&s;cription, but that individually, upon which the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was founded. The Conclu&s;ion of all is, That if a Right to Par|&s;onage-Teinds be a <HI>jus unicum &amp; individuum,</HI> Pre|&s;cription mu&s;t run again&s;t it totally, or not at all. If the Right fall, it mu&s;t fall with its Con&s;equences; if it &s;tand, it mu&s;t &s;tand with its Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame Manner, the Right to Feu-duties is <HI>jus unicum &amp; individuum.</HI> The Right it&s;elf can never pre&s;cribe, being inherent in the Superiority, which again being a Right to Lands, can never &s;uf|fer
<PB N="132" REF="137">
the negative Pre&s;cription. The like of Tack-duties, which are con&s;tituted in one Contract, e&s;tabli&s;hed by one Con&s;ent, one Bargain.</P>
<P>'Tis extremly true, that in the&s;e Examples there has been Neglect, Di&s;u&s;e and Dereliction; all that is nece&s;&s;ary in the common Ca&s;es to found the nega|tive Pre&s;cription. But <HI>quid inde?</HI> To &s;ay that the negative Pre&s;cription in any particular Ca&s;e runs not, is, in other Words, to &s;ay, That the Law re&s;tores him again&s;t his Neglect, Di&s;u&s;e and Dereliction; therefore the per&s;onal Objection of Pre&s;cription lies not again&s;t him; Therefore he can in&s;i&s;t upon his Right <HI>quandocunque;</HI> And if he can in&s;i&s;t upon his Right, he can in&s;i&s;t upon it as it &s;tands, and as it &s;tood from the Beginning: For Pre&s;cription alters not the Nature of Rights, transforms them not into other Shapes; it cuts them down &s;imply, or allows them to &s;tand &s;imply. Thus in the Ca&s;e of Feu-duty, &s;ince the Right of Superiority pre|&s;cribes not, neither can the Claim for the Feu-duties, whether again&s;t the Va&s;&s;al, or again&s;t the Ground, which Claim is <HI>inherent</HI> in the Superiority, e&s;&s;ential to it; and therefore not to be divided from it.</P>
<P>If now the Matter be put upon this Footing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That by the Law of Nature, all Sorts of Rights fall by the negative Pre&s;cription, and among the re&s;t Right to Lands and Teinds; and that our Law, when it re&s;tores Proprietors again&s;t this Pre&s;cription, does it not totally, but only as to Bygones within 40 Years, and in Time to come."</Q> The Difficulty is, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That this is but an arbitrary Scheme. For taking the Thing in this View, it appears more rea&s;onable, that the Pre&s;cription &s;hould be allowed to run with Re&s;pect to the whole Bygones
<PB N="133" REF="138">
from the pre&s;ent Time. For truly the Neglect and Dereliction would infer &s;o much equally, as in the Ca&s;e of a Bond bearing Annualrent, in which the Annualrents within 40 Years fall by Pre&s;cription, as well as the Bond it&s;elf. And when we take a View of the Rea&s;on, why Right to Lands falls not by Pre&s;cription, the Objection will appear in a &s;tronger Light. A Man by our Law is re&s;tor'd to his Property, where it is not acquir'd to another by po&s;itive Pre&s;cription, becau&s;e the former Pro|prietor is in a more favourable Ca&s;e than the Fisk or fir&s;t Occupier: But there is no Rea&s;on he &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to Bygones, &s;eeing Liberation is more favourable than Obligation, e&s;pecially taking along that Neglect on the one Side, with|out <HI>bona fides</HI> on the other, is &s;ufficient in the negative Pre&s;cription. If then this Scheme come out to any Thing, it mu&s;t come out thus, That Property in Lands is lo&s;t by the negative Pre&s;cription, as well as other Rights, whereby all its Con&s;equences and Acce&s;&s;ories fall of Cour&s;e. But that our Law <HI>ob favorem</HI> gives back the Property, as by a <HI>new</HI> Right, unle&s;s it has been acquir'd to another by Pre&s;cription. 2<HI>do,</HI> There is another &s;trong Ob|jection again&s;t the Scheme, which cuts off the By|gones only preceeding 40 Years. Which is, That as the Law is &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;tore the Proprietor to the Bygones within 40 Years, becau&s;e of his Ne|glect with Re&s;pect to the&s;e of an older Date, It mu&s;t follow, that if he has purged his Neglect by uplifting any Year's Duty within the 40 Years, &s;uch a Document taken upon his Right mu&s;t be an Interruption, even as to Bygones, for 40 Years pre|ceeding the Date thereof. Now this will &s;carce be allowed, the contrary is the received Scheme, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="139">
That every Year's Pre&s;tation runs a di&s;tinct Cour&s;e of Pre&s;cription; and therefore, that the uplifting of one Year's Duty will not &s;ave another.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering this Matter in all its different Lights, the mo&s;t rational Footing it can be put upon, &s;eems to be, that the refu&s;ing Action upon annual Pre&s;ta|tions preceeding 40 Years, does not at all ari&s;e from Pre&s;cription, but from a quite different Founda|tion. The Law introduces a <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> that every Man will demand what is due to him, at lea&s;t within 40 Years, and that if he delays longer, it is becau&s;e Payment has already been made. I am the more &s;atisfied with this, from what I &s;ee in <HI>Durie,</HI> 15th <HI>December</HI> 1638, Laird of <HI>Gairntully</HI> contra Commi&s;&s;ary of St. <HI>Andrews.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where a Feu|duty being demanded after 40 Years, it was found, That this being a Debt owing by the Defender's own Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">er, he could not propone <HI>Pre&s;cription</HI> again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ame; But the Lords thought it ex|pedient, that the Pur&s;uer &s;hould re&s;trict his Libel to the Feu-duties ari&s;ing within the la&s;t 40 Years."</Q> If this Scheme hold, it will follow, that the Pur|&s;uer has Acce&s;s in this Ca&s;e to refer to the Defender's Oath, that the Duties even preceeding the 40 Years are &s;till re&s;ting owing. Which, as above &s;et forth, he has no Acce&s;s to do in the proper Pre&s;cription. And thus Pre&s;cription, in Ca&s;es of this Kind, is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame Nature with the quinquennial Pre&s;cription of Tack-duties, &amp;c. and triennial Pre|&s;cription of Merchant Accompts, &amp;c. none of which truly are of the Nature of the proper Pre|&s;cription. They found not a per&s;onal Objection again&s;t the Pur&s;uer upon the <HI>Medium</HI> of Neglect or Dereliction. They are nothing el&s;e but a <HI>Pre&s;ump|tion</HI> introduc'd by Law, that the Debt is &s;atisfied,
<PB N="135" REF="140">
which has this Effect to throw the <HI>onus probandi</HI> upon the Pur&s;uer, that the Debt is &s;till re&s;ting owing.</P>
<P>Thus far upon the Que&s;tion with Relation to Rights that fall not by Pre&s;cription, whether at lea&s;t they &s;hould not fall as to Bygones preceed|ing forty Years? We proceed now to another Que&s;tion with Relation to Teinds in particular, Why they &s;hould not fall totally by the negative Pre&s;cription? It is laid down by Lord <HI>Stair</HI> in his In&s;titutions, &sect; 22. <HI>hujus tituli, That a Right to Teinds may be pre&s;cribed as well as other Rights by forty Years Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but that a Right to by|gone Teinds, being founded in publick Law pre|&s;cribes not except as to Bygones before forty Years.</HI> Thus in our Law, Teinds are &s;ubject to the <HI>po&s;i|tive,</HI> but not <HI>negative</HI> Pre&s;cription: Yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the Rea&s;on given here for the Difference, is not quite &s;atis ying. All Rights are founded in publick Law. as well as Teinds; be&s;ides that publick Law has no more Re|lation to the <HI>negative</HI> than <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Pre&s;cription. To take this Matter from the Beginning, 'tis obvious, that before the Reformation, while Teinds were the Patrimony of the Church, and not alienable, they were in no View pre&s;criptable, as being <HI>ex|tra commercium,</HI> ju&s;t as much as the <HI>res &s;acrae, &s;anctae &amp; religio&s;ae</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> But the Ca&s;e differed after the Abolition of <HI>Popery,</HI> Teinds continuing no longer the Patrimony of the Church, they were erected into temporal Lord&s;hips, gifted away to particular Per&s;ons, and now plainly <HI>in com|mercio.</HI> 'Tis true, they continue &s;till burdened with a competent Provi&s;ion to Mini&s;ters: So far as that
<PB N="136" REF="141">
Burden goes, they are &s;till <HI>extra commercium,</HI> and con&s;equently not pre&s;criptable. But as for the In|tere&s;t the Laity have in Teinds, 'tis perhaps not ea&s;y to account why that Intere&s;t &s;hould not &s;uffer the <HI>negative</HI> as well as <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Pre&s;cription. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Ca&s;e, that a Per&s;on who is Titular of his own Teinds, di&s;po&s;es upon the &s;ame by Way of Sale, the Purcha&s;er forbears during forty Years to in&s;i&s;t upon his Contract; it does not appear why the Contract &s;hould not fall by Pre&s;cription, and of Con&s;equence the Right to the Teind-duties: Nor is it any Way repugnant, that the &s;ame Teinds &s;hould yet continue to be a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Subject, liable to the Burden of the Mini&s;ters Stipend; becau&s;e, as above laid down, Pre&s;cription gives only an <HI>ex&s;trin|&s;ick</HI> Exception again&s;t the Pur&s;uer claiming, but operates not an Extinction of the Right claimed. I have formerly thought that Teind is a Land-right; and therefore &s;uffers not the negative Pre&s;cription: But this is not ju&s;t. Teinds are a <HI>Burden</HI> upon Land, ju&s;t as an Infeftment of Annualrent is. And if the negative Pre&s;cription &s;hould take Place, the Con&s;equence would be a <HI>Liberation</HI> only, not a <HI>Transference</HI> of Property. Were a Right to Teinds to be con&s;idered not as a <HI>jus unicum &amp; indivi|duum,</HI> but a &s;eparate <HI>principal independent</HI> Right as to every di&s;tinct Years Teind-duty, the Matter would be expedite. But this is not &s;o, as is en|deavoured to be made out above. And truly after all, &s;ince a Right to Teinds is acquirable by Pre|&s;cription, which &s;uppo&s;es it a <HI>jus unicum &amp; indi|viduum,</HI> it appears a fair Con&s;equence, that it &s;hould be lo&s;t the &s;ame Way.</P>
<P>As to the negative Pre&s;cription of Viccarage|teinds, there is a remarkable Deci&s;ion ob&s;erved by

<P>To reconcile the&s;e Texts, the Doctors make this Di&s;tinction, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> Whether the Defunct's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

was <HI>vitious,</HI> or <HI>bona fide</HI> by any lawful Title, &s;uch as <HI>commodatum, depo&s;itum, precario,</HI> or &s;uch like.

<P>In the mid&s;t of &s;o much Ob&s;curity, what Light &s;hall we find. Among all the Authorities above|cited, <HI>Papinian</HI> is the &s;ingle Writer, who gives a Rea&s;on for his Opinion. Says he, There can be no <HI>U&s;ucapio pro Haerede, quia haeres in jus omne de|functi &s;uccedit, &amp; ignoratione &s;ua defuncti vitia non excludit.</HI> Which is, in other Words, That the Heir is the &s;ame Per&s;on with the Defunct; and therefore cannot be in a better Situation than him. This, I confe&s;s, I could never throughly compre|hend; An Heir indeed is thus far the &s;ame Per|&s;on with the Defunct, that he is liable for all his Debts, and &s;ucceeds in all his Rights. But it was never imagined, that an Heir is the &s;ame Per&s;on with the Defunct, with re&s;pect to any purely per|&s;onal Quality or Property, good or bad. If the Defunct has committed a Crime, the Heir is not the
<PB N="145" REF="150">
&s;ame Per&s;on in any Sen&s;e to be liable as the Crimi|nal. If the Defunct was a Tutor, the Heir repre|&s;ents him <HI>qua Debitor,</HI> not <HI>qua Tutor.</HI> The &s;ame Way, if the Defunct was <HI>in mala fide,</HI> that is a per&s;onal Property, wherein the Heir repre&s;ents him not; the Heir may well be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>in bona fide,</HI> tho' the <HI>mala fides</HI> of his Predece&s;&s;or be ever &s;o cer|tain; And this <HI>Papinian</HI> him&s;elf does allow in the Text, giving an In&s;tance of it in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Precarium.</HI></P>
<P>Let us examine what Light we can have from Principles. It mu&s;t be obvious from the Nature of Pre&s;cription, that the Title, real or putative, to which the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a&s;cribes his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be in its Nature <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>exclu&s;ive.</HI> Thus the Title <HI>pro emptore</HI> is an ab&s;olute exclu&s;ive Title; for this good Rea&s;on, that the &s;ame Subject cannot totally belong to two at once. There cannot be Pre&s;crip|tion again&s;t a Right, which is compatible and con|&s;i&s;tent with the Right upon which the Pre&s;criber founds. Therefore a Right of a Wad&s;et, or of a Feu acquired by Pre&s;cription, does no more <HI>ex|clude</HI> the Rever&s;er or Superior, than the Purcha&s;e of them does from the true Proprietor. To apply this, let us con&s;ider if at all, or in what Ca&s;es the Title <HI>pro haerede</HI> is an ab&s;olute exclu&s;ive Title. At fir&s;t View, it is plainly an ab&s;olute and exclu&s;ive Title, as to all competing Heirs. If one Per&s;on be <HI>&s;ole</HI> Heir to the Defunct, which is always implied in a Service where but one is mentioned, no other Per&s;on can be Heir. Thus far then there may be an <HI>u&s;u|capio pro herede.</HI> His <HI>bona fides,</HI> with the putative Title of being &s;ole Heir, will &s;upport him in the Right, after having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed during that Cour&s;e of Time the Law requires. Let us next con&s;ider how
<PB N="146" REF="151">
this Title &s;tands, with Re&s;pect to the Debts and Deeds of the Defunct. As to the&s;e it mu&s;t be al|lowed, that it is far from being an <HI>ab&s;olute ex|clu&s;ive</HI> Title. An Heir <HI>qua</HI> &s;uch is liable to, and burdened with all the Debts and Deeds of the Per|&s;on whom he repre&s;ents: And therefore the Title <HI>pro herede</HI> is &s;o far from being <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> in this Ca&s;e, that in Reality it implies this Burden, ju&s;t as much as a Wad&s;et implies a Rever&s;ion, or a Feu the Right of Superiority. This brings it to the &s;ame, as if the Debts and Deeds of the Predece&s;&s;or were every one of them &s;pecified in the Heir's Right. In this Ca&s;e therefore the Heir can have no <HI>bona fides,</HI> no Security. The Debts and Deeds of his Predece&s;&s;or he mu&s;t ever lay his Account to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>If this hold, and upon a Review, I cannot find but it is &s;olid, the Di&s;tinction above laid down by the Commentators mu&s;t fall to the Ground as with|out any Foundation. If the Defunct's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was as <HI>Colonus</HI> or <HI>Commoditarius,</HI> the Action <HI>loca|ti conducti,</HI> or <HI>Commodati</HI> competent again&s;t him, mu&s;t be good again&s;t his Heir for ever, until they fall by the negative Pre&s;cription. 'Tis true the Heir may believe, that the Subject belonged to the Defunct in Property; but then it is not every vague Opinion any how taken up, that will found the <HI>bona fides</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for Pre&s;cription. It mu&s;t be a &s;olid Belief founded upon good Rea&s;on. An Heir can never have a &s;olid <HI>bona fides,</HI> as to any Subject de&s;cending to him from the Defunct. For ought he knows, it may belong to another, no Body has told him otherwi&s;e; it may be given or pro|mi&s;ed away; it may be burdened with Debt. The very Title of Heir obliges him to &s;ubmit to all the&s;e Chances; which, as above laid down, effectually
<PB N="147" REF="152">
excludes that <HI>Security,</HI> that <HI>bona fides,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every Acqui&s;ition by Pre|&s;cription. It mu&s;t be obvious then, that this Di|&s;tinction betwixt a <HI>bona fide</HI> and vitious Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, can &s;ignify nothing at all as to the Que&s;tion in Hand.</P>
<P>It being thus laid down, that <HI>u&s;ucapio pro hae|rede</HI> is well founded where the Competition is among Heirs, but that it cannot obtain again&s;t the Debts and Deeds of the Predece&s;&s;or, let us in the next Place, examine what the Texts above-cited &s;ay as to this Di&s;tinction. The <HI>L.</HI> 11. <HI>diver&s;. &amp; temporal. Pre&s;cript. L.</HI> 1. &amp; <HI>ult. C. U&s;ucap. pro hae|red.</HI> &amp; &sect; 12. <HI>In&s;titut. U&s;ucap.</HI> relate all of them &s;ole|ly to the &s;econd Branch of the Di&s;tinction. And the Authors have nothing in View but the Debts and Deeds of the Predece&s;&s;or, in the&s;e Texts where they declare again&s;t the <HI>u&s;ucapio pro haerede.</HI> The <HI>L.</HI> 33. &sect; 1. cited upon the other Side of the Que|&s;tion plainly relates to the fir&s;t Branch of the Di|&s;tinction. The Words are, <HI>Hoc amplius, &s;i ju&s;tam cau&s;am habuerit exi&s;timandi, &s;e haeredem vel bo|norum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;orem Domino extiti&s;&s;e fundum pro hae|rede po&s;&s;idebit.</HI> The <HI>L. ult. pro haered.</HI> may well be under&s;tood of the &s;ame Ca&s;e: So there remains none that requires an An&s;wer &s;ave <HI>L.</HI> 3. <HI>pro haered.

<P>According to the Doctrine here laid down, there mu&s;t be a great Difference with re&s;pect to the two Sorts of po&s;itive Pre&s;cription e&s;tabli&s;hed in our Law, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> that of Heirs, and that of original Purcha&s;ers; the la&s;t gives Security again&s;t all Mortals; the other gives no Security again&s;t the Debts and Deeds of the Predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>It remains only to be mentioned, that the <HI>U&s;u|capio pro haerede,</HI> &s;o far as it relates to the Compe|tition among Heirs, is e&s;tabli&s;hed in our Law by Act 1617, <HI>Cap</HI> 13. and a Time fixed much &s;hor|ter than the ordinary Cour&s;e of Pre&s;cription: For it &s;tatutes, That no Retour &s;hall be reduceable af|ter twenty Years.

talks in general of the righteous Heir, and neare&s;t of Kin; And thus it was found 11th <HI>July</HI> 1701, Lady <HI>Edingla&s;&s;ie</HI> contra Laird of <HI>Powrie,</HI> ob&s;erved by <HI>Fountainhall,</HI> That <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this Act does relate main|ly to erroneous Services, where a remoter Heir is retoured in Prejudice of a nearer; but that it does not found Heirs &s;erved to quarrel their own Re|tours upon Minority and Le&s;ion, or &s;uch like; &s;eeing Minority and Le&s;ion was a Ground of Re|duction before that Act, and needed no new Law."</Q> As for the Deci&s;ion <HI>Lamb</HI> contra <HI>An|der&s;on,</HI> when it is looked into, it holds forth no &s;uch Di&s;tinction. The Ca&s;e there was, That a younger Brother had &s;erved Heir while the elder was out of the Country: And the Di&s;pute turned &s;olely up|on this, the elder Brother having returned with in the twenty Years, and dying &s;oon after the Lap&s;e thereof, without intenting an actual Reduc|tion of his Brother's Retour, whether the elde&s;t Bro|ther's Creditor, who had charged him to enter Heir within the twenty Years and adjudged, could have Acce&s;s to the Lands. Here it was not called in|to Controver&s;y, but that if the Heir had died abroad, without making any Motion again&s;t his Brother's Retour, the Retour would have &s;tood good. It was only contended, That the Heir's Return with the Charge again&s;t him to enter, was equivalent to a Reduction of the Brother's Retour; which the Lords found. Sir <HI>George</HI> has a &s;econd Ob&s;ervation upon this Act: His Words are, <HI>By this Act, though &s;uch Retours may be reduced in Prejudice of Per&s;ons &s;o &s;erved; yet if the Per&s;ons &s;o &s;erved have di&s;poned their Right to &s;ingular Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, having</HI> bona fide <HI>acquired Rights, as &s;aid is, they cannot be prejudged. And in our Law</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="155">
<HI>this is &s;till introduced for the Good of Commerce in Favours of &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors; for how &s;hould they know, that the Retour was reducible?</HI> Were this Ob&s;ervation founded in the Act, it would give a Security to Purcha&s;ers, and in my Opinion a rea&s;o|nable one, that our Law as yet is not acquainted with. It is no where held forth in general, That onerous Purcha&s;ers are &s;afe again&s;t all latent Claims; all of the&s;e they &s;tand expo&s;ed to, that from their Nature are good again&s;t &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors, and this among others. Our Legi&s;lature has indeed recti|fied this in &s;ome Mea&s;ure by &s;everal &s;alutary Laws; among the&s;e the Act of Pre&s;cription makes the great|e&s;t Figure. It has further introduced Regi&s;ters, and appointed &s;everal Kinds of Rights to be regi&s;tred under this Certification, that otherwi&s;e they &s;hall not be good again&s;t &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors. But there are many Rights &s;till behind, not appointed to be regi&s;tred, and many more that from their Nature cannot admit of it; of which this in Hand is an Example; all of the&s;e are good again&s;t Purcha&s;ers. Let us examine what the Act &s;ays as to this. The Words are, <HI>It is always declared, That the&s;e Pre|&s;ents &s;hall nowi&s;e be prejudicial to what&s;oever Per|&s;ons who have acquired Rights of Lands and Heri|tages before the Date hereof</HI> bona fide, <HI>from Per|&s;ons already retoured thereto in any Time bygone: But the &s;aid Per&s;ons who have</HI> bona fide <HI>acquired, &s;hall bruik their Rights</HI> ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEN STANDING. The Meaning of this is extreme|ly obvious. The Law referred to is <HI>Parl.</HI> 1494. <HI>C.</HI> 57. by which it was introduced, That Retours &s;hould be unquarrellable after three Years, both with Re&s;pect to the Inque&s;t, and the Per&s;on &s;erved. This was altered by the pre&s;ent Act, &s;o far as re|lates
<PB N="151" REF="156">
to the Per&s;on &s;erved, who mu&s;t now run a Cour&s;e of twenty, Years Pre&s;cription. This Altera|tion being made, it remained to be con&s;idered what &s;hould become of tho&s;e who had purcha&s;ed <HI>bona fide</HI> after three Years, from Per&s;ons &s;tanding infeft upon Retours, enjoying the Privileges of the former Law. The Re&s;olution upon this was obvious, that they mu&s;t be &s;ecure, &s;eeing the Per&s;ons from whom they purcha&s;ed were &s;ecure by the &s;aid triennial Pre|&s;cription. Sir <HI>George</HI> in the above Citation under|&s;tands this Clau&s;e as a Privilege introduced in ge|neral in Favours of &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors, both who had acquired, and who &s;hould acquire thereafter. There needs little other Argument again&s;t this, but the Clau&s;e it&s;elf upon which he founds his Ob|&s;ervation, which in expre&s;s Terms re&s;tricts this De|claration to &s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors, who had purcha&s;ed before the Date of this pre&s;ent Act. That Purcha|&s;ers from the Nature of the Thing are not &s;ecure again&s;t this Reduction, will be clear, 1<HI>mo,</HI> Becau&s;e this Reduction is not <HI>per&s;onal</HI> again&s;t the Defen|der, but <HI>real</HI> in the Subject. The righteous Heir coming up, claims the Subject as his own, and the Per&s;on retoured cannot &s;tand in his Way, ha|ving no Right e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Subject till after the Cour&s;e of the twenty Years Pre&s;cription. In &s;hort, it is not properly a Right <HI>reducible,</HI> but <HI>null,</HI> till it be <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> by Pre&s;cription, which is the common Nature of Rights to which the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription is nece&s;&s;ary: And therefore a Purcha&s;er from a Per&s;on erroneou&s;ly retoured can be no more &s;afe within the Years of Pre&s;cription, than any one who purcha&s;es a <HI>non Domino.</HI> 2<HI>do,</HI> This is plainly the Opinion of the Legi&s;lature in the above-cited Clau&s;e, protecting the Purcha&s;ers only from tho&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="157">
who&s;e Retours become irreduceable by Pre&s;cription. 3<HI>tio,</HI> Were Purcha&s;ers from Heirs ab&s;olutely &s;ecure <HI>a principio</HI> again&s;t this Reduction, no good Rea|&s;on could be given why this Reduction &s;hould be limited to twenty Years, rather than the common Period of forty: Whereas upon the Suppo&s;ition, that Purcha&s;ers are not &s;ecure till after the Lap&s;e of twenty Years, there is an exceeding good Rea|&s;on for it. One buys from an Heir, &s;eeing a &s;uf|ficient good Progre&s;s for forty or fifty Years by|gone. This gives him tolerable good Security, un|le&s;s with Re&s;pect to this Reduction at the In&s;tance of a nearer Heir. It would be hard in this Ca&s;e to leave him open and in&s;ecure for the Cour&s;e of a &s;econd forty Years. In a Word, a &s;horter Pre&s;crip|tion than twenty Years would be hard upon the righteous Heir; a longer would be hard upon Pur|cha&s;ers.</P>

Servitudes are acquired by Pre&s;cription, without any expre&s;s Title in Writing.

Other Servitudes, &s;uch as paying dry Mul|tures, are upon a different Footing. There every Act of Exerci&s;e of the Servitude infers a pre&s;ent Con&s;ent, if there has not been one antecedent; for it is rational enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Man will pay dry Multures, in Sub&s;erviency to another Man's Right already con&s;tituted, or in order to give a new Right: But the Suppo&s;ition is quite ab&s;urd, that a Man looking to his own Intere&s;t, and having no other View, but to act in his Right of Liberty, would go about to pay dry Multure.</P>

<P>3<HI>tio,</HI> In &s;ome Ca&s;es it is laudable to forbear Acti|on, as for Example, where a Woman in Decency forbears to pur&s;ue her Husband; and therefore du|ring the Time &s;he is clad with a Husband, Pre&s;crip|tion runs not again&s;t her, forbearing to pur&s;ue for Implement of her Contract of Marriage <HI>Stair, Gilmour,</HI> 5<HI>th July</HI> 1665. <HI>Macky</HI> contra <HI>Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>4<HI>to,</HI> Where the Circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that he can have no Benefit by acting. As for Example, Where a Man having in his Per&s;on two Adjudica|tions upon an E&s;tate, continues to po&s;&s;e&s;s upon one of them for upwards of 40 Years, which is after|wards found redeemable. The other Adjudication in the mean Time will not &s;uffer the negative Pre|&s;cription; becau&s;e he was not negligent in not per|&s;uing upon it, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole E&s;tate by
<PB N="161" REF="166">
Vertue of the other Adjudication. And thus a Man is never put under a Nece&s;&s;ity to act, when he can have no other View but to &s;top Pre&s;cription. For Pre&s;cription being a Con&s;equence of Neglect; if he was not negligent, which he is not, when he could have no Benefit by acting, the Pre&s;cription cannot run. It was objected again&s;t a Defender pleading upon the po&s;itive Pre&s;cription, that for &s;ome time during the forty Years, there was a Liferent of the Subject in Que&s;tion in the Per&s;on of one of the Defen|der's Authors, to which Liferent the Pur&s;uer was Con&s;enter; and therefore during that Time he was <HI>non valens agere,</HI> in Re&s;pect by no Action could he obtain Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And the Lords never put Par|ties to the Nece&s;&s;ity of intenting Proce&s;&s;es where they can &s;erve to no Purpo&s;e but to &s;top Pre&s;cripti|on which was &s;u&s;tained, <HI>Stair.</HI> 28<HI>th February</HI> 1666.

Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> contra Earl of <HI>Tweedale.</HI> 17<HI>th January</HI> 1672. <HI>Young</HI> contra <HI>Thom&s;on.</HI> 5<HI>th February</HI> 1680, <HI>Brown</HI> contra <HI>Hep|burn.</HI> An apparent Heir in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an E&s;tate by &s;ingular Titles, having thereafter purcha&s;ed in an Appri&s;ing, it was found, That the apparent Heirs Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion did pre&s;erve the &s;aid Appri&s;ing from the negative Pre&s;cription. It being pled in the ge|neral, That where a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has many Rights in his Per&s;on, all di&s;tinct Titles of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; Pre|&s;cription cannot run again&s;t one of them &s;o long as he keeps Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For what can he demand up|on any of the&s;e Titles but to have the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which if he already has, there can be no Occa&s;ion for an Action. But afterwards upon a reclaiming Bill the Lords found no Nece&s;&s;ity of determining this Point, having taken it up upon a &s;eparate Foot|ing

<P>5<HI>to,</HI> No Man can pre&s;crive again&s;t him&s;elf. Of this take the following Example. The E&s;tate of <HI>Pai&s;ley,</HI> &amp;c. &s;tood ve&s;ted in the Per&s;on of Lord <HI>Cochran,</HI> tailied to him&s;elf and Heirs Male; after his Decea&s;e his Grandfather the Earl of <HI>Dundonald;</HI> who had no Right in his own Per&s;on, granted a Difpo&s;ition of the &s;ame E&s;tate to the Lord <HI>Cochran</HI>'s Son and his Heirs Male. One of whom above 40 Years thereafter altered the De&s;tination, and con|veyed the Subject to his Daughter. The Di&s;po&s;iti|on granted by the Earl of <HI>Dundonald</HI> being null as <HI>a non habente pote&s;tatem,</HI> the E&s;tate in Con&s;equence was found to be all the while <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of the Lord <HI>Cochran,</HI> upon which the Heir Male, who had Acce&s;s to make up his Titles to the Lord <HI>Cochran,</HI> after the Decea&s;e of him who conveyed the Subject, as &s;aid is, to his Daughter, quarrelled the Conveyance as being a gratuitous Deed by an appa|rent Heir. And the forty Years po&s;itive Pre&s;crip|tion in Con&s;equence of the Earl of <HI>Dundonald</HI>'s Di&s;|po&s;ition being pled in &s;upport thereof; the Pre&s;crip|tion was not found to run, in Re&s;pect that no Man can pre&s;crive again&s;t him&s;elf. <HI>Home,</HI> 26<HI>th January</HI> 1726, Marquis of <HI>Clyd&s;dale</HI> contra Earl of <HI>Dun|donald.</HI> In this Ca&s;e there were no <HI>termini habiles</HI> for Pre&s;cription. Pre&s;cription nece&s;&s;arily implies two
<PB N="163" REF="168">
Per&s;ons, two oppo&s;ite Intere&s;ts; the one in a Cour&s;e of acquiring either Property or Liberation; the o|ther in a Cour&s;e of Neglect, forbearing to follow out his Intere&s;t. Here there was but one Per&s;on, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> the Heir Male: And no Man can be accu&s;ed of Negligence for not following out an Action a|gain&s;t him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, no Ground of Action aro&s;e until the Di&s;po&s;ition was granted to the Daughter, and the De&s;tination to Heirs Male thereby broke in upon. We have then three Foundations, each of which &s;eparately is &s;ufficient to &s;upport this Deci&s;i|on. 1<HI>mo,</HI> A Man cannot pre&s;cribe again&s;t him&s;elf. 2<HI>do,</HI> No Benefit in pur&s;uing. 3<HI>tio,</HI> No Action un|til the Time the Di&s;po&s;ition was granted to the Daughter.</P>
<P>As to Interruption of Pre&s;cription, no Document taken upon the Debt, will be &s;ufficient to interrupt the negative Pre&s;cription, unle&s;s it be &s;uch as is &s;uffi|cient to interpel the Debitor. Thus, Regi&s;tration of a Bond is no &s;ufficient Interruption. But when this is examined, it will not be found to &s;quare exact|ly with the Principles laid down anent the negative Pre&s;cription. 'Tis obvious that Regi&s;tration alone is &s;ufficient to purge the Creditors Neglect: And when further Interpellation of the Debitor is found nece&s;&s;ary, it can be with no other View, than to put an End to the <HI>bona fide</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Liberty. Now this indeed is rea&s;onable, as was hinted above, but as our Practice requires no <HI>bona fides</HI> in a Debi|tor, this Interpellation, in order to an Interruption of the negative Pre&s;cription, &s;eems not to be well founded in Principles; po&s;&s;ibly it may be held, that the Regi&s;tration of a Bond without going on to in|terpel the Debitor for the Space of forty Years, in|fers
<PB N="164" REF="169">
a Pre&s;umption of &s;ome original Vitio&s;ity in the Bond, which barred the Creditor from bringing it &s;ooner to Light. And it may be &s;aid, that Inter|pellation of the Debitor within the forty Years is a nece&s;&s;ary Step to take off this Pre&s;umption. What|ever be in this, 'tis plain it cannot be univer&s;al: For to put the Ca&s;e where the Debitor acknowledges upon Oath that the Debt is ju&s;t; there &s;imple Re|gi&s;tration ought to be deemed &s;ufficient to interrupt the negative Pre&s;cription.</P>
