<P>YOung Authors, like young Wives, are lyable to di&s;tru&s;t their own Conduct in every thing; and, whil&s;t they fear venturing too far, are apt to &s;top &s;hort, and rob their Benefactors of tho&s;e Ac|knowledgments they ju&s;tly de&s;erve: Or, by u&s;eing too loo&s;e a Rein, unavoidably
<PB REF="3">
run into Adulation. But I need fear neither of the&s;e Cen&s;ures, &s;ince your Mode&s;ty, which is &s;o con&s;picuous, will pardon one, and your Character be a &s;ufficient defence again&s;t t'other, for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay more of you than you de&s;erve.</P>
<P>To attempt your Character, wou'd be too daring an Undertaking; For what Pen, be&s;ides your own, cou'd expre&s;s that ju&s;t Thought, lively Fancy, flowing and ea&s;y Language, that adorn tho&s;e Pieces, which, like ine&s;timable Jewels, too valu|able for common u&s;e, are re&s;erv'd for the Entertainment of your happy Friends? Your luckly Genius in Poetry, and your peculiar ta&s;t for Mu&s;ick, proclaim you the Mu&s;es Darling; for you they re&s;erve their choice&s;t Favours: And, indeed, without &s;uch Qualifications, no Man can have a true Reli&s;h for Productions of this kind; and the mo&s;t Excellent Pieces, wou'd be entertain'd with Coldne&s;s and Contempt.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
How I have perform'd in the follow|ing Scenes, is neither po&s;&s;ible, nor pro|per for me to determine; 'tis Prai&s;e e|nough, that you have given me leave to lay it at your Feet, which I prefer be|fore the vain Applau&s;e of clapping Mul|titudes; nor cou'd I ever excu&s;e it, either to the World, or my &s;elf, if I &s;lipt any opportunity of publi&s;hing the Honour you do me: 'Tis a Vanity we are all lyable to, and we glory in the Ex|cellencies of our Patron. Be&s;ides the advantage, 'tis a piece of Ju&s;tice due to this Poem, and my &s;elf, to fly for Sanctu|ary to one who is mo&s;t apt to Pardon, be|cau&s;e the mo&s;t capable to Judge; and has him&s;elf not only approv'd, but al&s;o, by his inimitable Performance, Correct|ed and Refin'd upon the mo&s;t plea&s;ant parts of Poetry.</P>

<P>Oh Love! How powerful are thy Charms, thus to unman, and &s;end me like a Boy, gaping after Imaginary Joys.</P>
<P>Not all the Hazards of a Soldier's Life cou'd half &s;o much a&s;&s;ect me, as the dreadful Apprehen&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ing this Girl.</P>
