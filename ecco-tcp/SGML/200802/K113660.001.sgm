<P>THERE are an hundred faults in this Thing, and an hundred things might be &s;aid to prove them beauties. But it is needle&s;s. A book may be amu&s;ing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a &s;ingle ab&s;urdity. The hero of this piece unites in him&s;elf the three greate&s;t characters upon earth; he is a prie&s;t, an hu&s;bandman, and the father of a family. He is drawn as ready to teach, and ready to obey, as &s;imple in affluence, and maje&s;tic in adver&s;ity. In this age of opulence and refinement whom can &s;uch a character plea&s;e? Such as are fond of high life, will turn with di&s;dain from the &s;implicity of his country fire-&s;ide. Such as mi&s;take ribaldry for humour, will find no wit in his harmle&s;s conver&s;ation; and &s;uch

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The de&s;cription of the family of Wake|field; in which a kindred likene&s;s pre|vails as well of minds as of per&s;ons.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I WAS ever of opinion, that the hone&s;t man who married and brought up a large family, did more &s;ervice than he who continued &s;in|gle, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had &s;carce taken orders a year before I began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of matri|mony, cho&s;e my wife as &s;he did her wed|ding gown, not for a fine glo&s;&s;y &s;urface, but &s;uch qualities as would wear well. To do her ju&s;tice, &s;he was a good-natured no|table woman; and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who at that time could &s;hew more. She could read any Engli&s;h book without much &s;pelling, and for pickling, pre&s;erving, and cookery,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
none could excel her. She prided her|&s;elf much al&s;o upon being an excellent contriver in hou&s;e-keeping; yet I could never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.</P>
<P>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondne&s;s encrea&s;ed with age. There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was &s;pent in moral or rural amu&s;e|ments; in vi&s;iting our rich neighbours, or relieving &s;uch as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to un|dergo; all our adventures were by the fire-&s;ide, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown.</P>
<P>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or &s;tranger come to ta&s;te our goo&s;eberry wine, for which we had great reputation; and I profe&s;s with the veracity of an hi&s;torian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our cou|&s;ins
<PB N="3" REF="6">
too, even to the fortieth remove, all remembered their affinity, without any help from the Herald's office, and came very frequently to &s;ee us. Some of them did us no great honour by the&s;e claims of kindred; for literally &s;peaking, we had the blind, the maimed, and the halt among&s;t the number. However, my wife always in&s;i&s;ted that as they were the &s;ame <HI>fle&s;h and blood</HI> with us, they &s;hould &s;it with us at the &s;ame table. So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends about us; for this remark will hold good thro' life, that the poorer the gue&s;t, the better plea&s;ed he ever is with being treated: and as &s;ome men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip, and others are &s;mit|ten with the wing of a butterfly, &s;o I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces. However, when any one of our re|lations was found to be a per&s;on of very bad character, a trouble&s;ome gue&s;t, or one we de&s;ired to get rid of, upon his leaving my hou&s;e for the fir&s;t time, I ever took care to lend him a riding coat, or a pair of
<PB N="4" REF="7">
boots, or &s;ometimes an hor&s;e of &s;mall va|lue, and I always had the &s;atisfaction of finding he never came back to return them. By this the hou&s;e was cleared of &s;uch as we did not like; but never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors.</P>
<P>Thus we lived &s;everal years in a &s;tate of much happine&s;s, not but that we &s;ome|times had tho&s;e little rubs which Providence &s;ends to enhance the value of its other favours. My orchard was often robbed by &s;chool-boys, and my wife's cu&s;tards plun|dered by the cats or the children. The 'Squire would &s;ometimes fall a&s;leep in the mo&s;t pathetic parts of my &s;ermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curte&s;y. But we &s;oon got over the unea&s;ine&s;s cau&s;ed by &s;uch accidents, and u&s;ually in three or four days we be|gan to wonder how they vext us.</P>
<P>My children, the offspring of tempe|rance, as they were educated without &s;oft|ne&s;s,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
&s;o they were at once well formed and healthy; my &s;ons hardy and active, my daughters dutiful and blooming. When I &s;tood in the mid&s;t of the little circle, which promi&s;ed to be the &s;upports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous &s;tory of Count Aben&s;berg, who, in Henry II's progre&s;s through Ger|many, when other courtiers came with their trea&s;ures, brought his thirty-two children, and pre&s;ented them to his &s;overeign as the mo&s;t valuable offering he had to be&s;tow. In this manner, though I had but &s;ix, I con|&s;idered them as a very valuable pre&s;ent made to my country, and con&s;equently looked upon it as my debtor. Our elde&s;t &s;on was named George, after his uncle, who left us ten thou&s;and pounds. Our &s;econd child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Gri&s;&s;el; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, in|&s;i&s;ted upon her being called Olivia. In le&s;s than another year we had a daughter again, and now I was determined that Gri&s;|&s;el &s;hould be her name; but a rich relation
<PB N="6" REF="9">
taking a fancy to &s;tand godmother, the girl was, by her directions, called Sophia; &s;o that we had two romantic names in the family; but I &s;olemnly prote&s;t I had no hand in it. Mo&s;es was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, we had two &s;ons more.</P>
<P>It would be fruitle&s;s to deny my exulta|tion when I &s;aw my little ones about me; but the vanity and the &s;atisfaction of my wife were even greater than mine. When our vi&s;itors would u&s;ually &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primro&s;e, you have the fine&s;t children in the whole country."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, neighbour,"</Q> &s;he would an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they are as heaven made them, hand&s;ome enough, if they be good enough; for hand&s;ome is that hand&s;ome does."</Q> And then &s;he would bid the girls hold up their heads; who, to con|ceal nothing, were certainly very hand|&s;ome. Mere out&s;ide is &s;o very trifling a cir|cum&s;tance with me, that I &s;hould &s;carce have remembered to mention it, had it not
<PB N="7" REF="10">
been a general topic of conver&s;ation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty with which pain|ters generally draw Hebe; open, &s;prightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not &s;o &s;triking at fir&s;t; but often did more certain execution; for they were &s;oft, mo|de&s;t, and alluring. The one vanqui&s;hed by a &s;ingle blow, the other by efforts &s;ucce&s;sfully repeated.</P>
<P>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features, at lea&s;t it was &s;o with my daughters. Olivia wi&s;hed for many lovers, Sophia to &s;ecure one. Olivia was often affected from too great a de&s;ire to plea&s;e. Sophia even re|pre&s;t excellence from her fears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the other with her &s;en&s;e when I was &s;erious. But the&s;e qualities were never carried to exce&s;s in either, and I have often &s;een them exchange charac|ters for a whole day together. A &s;uit of mourning has transformed my coquet into
<PB N="8" REF="11">
a prude, and a new &s;et of ribbands given her younger &s;i&s;ter more than natural viva|city. My elde&s;t &s;on George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned profe&s;&s;ions. My &s;econd boy Mo&s;es, whom I de&s;igned for bu&s;ine&s;s, received a &s;ort of a mi&s;cellaneous education at home. But it would be needle&s;s to attempt de|&s;cribing the particular characters of young people that had &s;een but very little of the world. In &s;hort, a family likene&s;s pre|vailed through all, and properly &s;peaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, &s;imple, and inoffen&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Family misfortunes. The lo&s;s of fortune only &s;erves to encrea&s;e the pride of the worthy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife's management, as to the &s;piritual I took them entirely under my own direction. The pro|fits of my living, which amounted to but thirty-five pounds a year, I gave to the or|phans and widows of the clergy of our dioce&s;e; for having a &s;ufficient fortune of my own, I was carele&s;s of temporalities, and felt a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in doing my duty without reward. I al&s;o &s;et a re&s;olution of keeping no curate, and of being ac|quainted with every man in the pari&s;h, ex|horting the married men to temperance and the bachelors to matrimony; &s;o that in a few years it was a common &s;aying, that there
<PB N="10" REF="13">
were three &s;trange wants at Wakefield, a par&s;on wanting pride, young men wanting wives, and ale-hou&s;es wanting cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>Matrimony was always one of my fa|vourite topics, and I wrote &s;everal &s;er|mons to prove its utility and happine&s;s: but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of &s;upporting; for I main|tained with Whi&s;ton, that it was unlawful for a prie&s;t of the church of England, af|ter the death of his fir&s;t wife, to take a &s;econd, or to expre&s;s it in one word, I valued my&s;elf upon being a &s;trict mono|gami&s;t.</P>
<P>I was early innitiated into this important di&s;pute, on which &s;o many laborious vo|lumes have been written. I publi&s;hed &s;ome tracts upon the &s;ubject my&s;elf, which, as they never &s;old, I have the con&s;olation of thinking are read only by the happy <HI>Few.</HI> Some of my friends called this my weak &s;ide; but alas! they had not like me made it the &s;ubject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more
<PB N="11" REF="14">
important it appeared. I even went a &s;tep beyond Whi&s;ton in di&s;playing my principles: as he had engraven upon his wife's tomb that &s;he was the <HI>only</HI> wife of William Whi&s;ton; &s;o I wrote a &s;imilar epi|taph for my wife, though &s;till living, in which I extolled her prudence, oeconomy, and obedience till death; and having got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it an&s;wered &s;everal very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. It admoni&s;hed my wife of her duty to me, and my fidelity to her; it in&s;pired her with a pa&s;&s;ion for fame, and con&s;tantly put her in mind of her end.</P>
<P>It was thus, perhaps, from hearing mar|riage &s;o often recommended, that my elde&s;t &s;on, ju&s;t upon leaving college, fix|ed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dig|nitary in the church, and in circum&s;tances to give her a large fortune: but fortune was her &s;malle&s;t accompli&s;hment. Mi&s;s Arabella Wilmot was allowed by all, ex|cept my two daughters, to be completely
<PB N="12" REF="15">
pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were &s;till heightened by a complexion &s;o tran&s;parent, and &s;uch an happy &s;en&s;ibility of look, that even age could not gaze with in|difference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very hand&s;ome &s;ettlement on my &s;on, he was not aver&s;e to the match; &s;o both families lived together in all that harmony which generally precedes an expected alliance. Being convinced by experience that the days of court&s;hip are the mo&s;t happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period; and the various amu&s;ements which the young cou|ple every day &s;hared in each other's com|pany, &s;eemed to encrea&s;e their pa&s;&s;ion. We were generally awaked in the morning by mu&s;ic, and on fine days rode a hunting. The hours between breakfa&s;t and dinner the ladies devoted to dre&s;s and &s;tudy: they u&s;ually read a page, and then gazed at them&s;elves in the gla&s;s, which even phi|lo&s;ophers might own often pre&s;ented the page of greate&s;t beauty. At dinner my wife took the lead; for as &s;he always in|&s;i&s;ted upon carving every thing her&s;elf, it
<PB N="13" REF="16">
being her mother's way, &s;he gave us upon the&s;e occa&s;ions the hi&s;tory of every di&s;h. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and &s;ometimes, with the mu&s;ic ma&s;ter's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walking out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, &s;hortened the re&s;t of the day, with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except backgammon, at which my old friend and I &s;ometimes took a two-penny hit. Nor can I here pa&s;s over an ominous circum&s;tance that hap|pened the la&s;t time we played together: I only wanted to fling a quatre, and yet I threw deuce ace five times running.</P>
<P>Some months were elap&s;ed in this man|ner, till at la&s;t it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young cou|ple, who &s;eemed earne&s;tly to de&s;ire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not de&s;cribe the bu&s;y importance of my wife, nor the &s;ly looks of my daugh|ters: in fact, my attention was fixed on
<PB N="14" REF="17">
another object, the completing a tract which I intended &s;hortly to publi&s;h in de|fence of monogamy. As I looked upon this as a ma&s;ter-piece both for argument and &s;tyle, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid &s;hewing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of receiv|ing his approbation; but too late I di&s;co|vered that he was mo&s;t violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good rea&s;on; for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife. This, as may be expected, produced a di&s;pute attended with &s;ome acrimony, which threatened to interrupt our intended alliance: but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject at large.</P>
<P>It was managed with proper &s;pirit on both &s;ides: he a&s;&s;erted that I was heterodox, I retorted the charge: he replied, and I rejoined. In the mean time, while the controver&s;y was hotte&s;t, I was called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, advi&s;ed me to give up the di&s;|pute, and allow the old gentleman to be a <GAP DESC="missing" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ pages">
<PB N="15" REF="18">
if he could, at lea&s;t till my &s;on's wedding was over. <Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"relinqui&s;h the cau&s;e of truth, and let him be an hu&s;|band, already driven to the very verge of ab&s;urdity. You might as well advi&s;e me to give up my fortune as my argument."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That fortune,"</Q> returned my friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am now &s;orry to inform you, is almo&s;t no|thing. Your merchant in town, in who&s;e hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a &s;tatute of bank|ruptcy, and it is thought has not left a &s;hilling in the pound. I was unwilling to &s;hock you or the family with the account till after the wedding: but now it may &s;erve to moderate your warmth in the argument; for, I &s;uppo&s;e, your own prudence will enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|&s;embling at lea&s;t till your &s;on has the young lady's fortune &s;ecure."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> reurned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it &s;hall ne|ver make me a ra&s;cal, or induce me to di&s;avow my principles. I'll go this moment and inform the company of my circum&s;taces; and as for the argu|ment,
<PB N="16" REF="19">
I even here retract my former con|ce&s;&s;ions in the old gentleman's favour, nor will I allow him now to be an hu&s;|band either dejure, de facto, or in any &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the diffe|rent &s;en&s;ations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfortunes; but what others felt was &s;light to what the young lovers appeared to endure. Mr. Wilmot, who &s;eemed before &s;ufficiently in|clined to break off the match, was by this blow &s;oon determined: one virtue he had in perfection, which was prudence, too often the only virtue that is left us unimpaired at &s;eventy-two.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A migration. The fortunate circum&s;tances of our lives are generally found at la&s;t to be of our own procuring.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE only hope of our family now was, that the report of our mi&s;|fortunes might be malicious or premature: but a letter from my agent in town &s;oon came with a confirmation of every particu|lar. The lo&s;s of fortune to my&s;elf alone would have been trifling; the only unea&s;i|ne&s;s I felt was for my family, who were to be humble without &s;uch an education as could render them callous to contempt.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away before I attempted to re&s;train their affliction; for premature con&s;olation is but the remem|brancer of &s;orrow. During this interval,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
my thoughts were employed on &s;ome future means of &s;upporting them; and at la&s;t a &s;mall Cure of fifteen pounds a year was of|fered me in a di&s;tant neighbourhood, where I could &s;till enjoy my principles without mole&s;tation. With this propo&s;al I joyfully clo&s;ed, having determined to encrea&s;e my &s;alary by managing a little farm.</P>
<P>Having taken this re&s;olution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune; and all debts collected and paid, out of fourteen thou&s;and pounds we had now but four hundred remaining. My chief attention therefore was next to bring down the pride of my family to their cir|cum&s;tances; for I well knew that a&s;piring beggary is wretchedne&s;s it&s;elf. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You can't be ignorant, my children,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune; but prudence may do much in di&s;appointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wi&s;dom bids us conform to our humble &s;ituation. Let us then, without repining,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
give up tho&s;e &s;plendours with which numbers are wretched, and &s;eek in hum|bler circum&s;tances that peace with which all may be happy. The poor live plea|&s;antly without our help, and we are not &s;o imperfectly formed as to be incapable of living without theirs. No, my chil|dren, let us from this moment give up all preten&s;ions to gentility; we have &s;till enough left for happine&s;s if we are wi&s;e, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune."</Q></P>
<P>As my elde&s;t &s;on was bred a &s;cholar, I determined to &s;end him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our &s;upport and his own. The &s;eparation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances attendant on pe|nury. The day &s;oon arrived on which we were to di&s;per&s;e for the fir&s;t time. My &s;on, after taking leave of his mother and the re&s;t, who mingled their tears with their ki&s;&s;es, came to a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to be&s;tow. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are going, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great an|ce&s;tor, travelled there before you. Take from me the &s;ame hor&s;e that was given him by the good bi&s;hop Jewel, this &s;taff, and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the way: the&s;e two lines in it are worth a million, <HI>I have been young, and now am old; yet never &s;aw I the righteous man for&s;aken, or his &s;eed beg|ging their bread.</HI> Let this be your con|&s;olation as you travel on. Go, my boy, whatever be thy fortune let me &s;ee thee once a year; &s;till keep a good heart, and farewell."</Q> As he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of inte|grity and honour, I was under no appre|hen&s;ions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life; for I knew he would act a good part whether he ro&s;e or fell.</P>
<P>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days after|wards.
<PB N="21" REF="24">
The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed &s;o many hours of tranquility, was not without a tear, which &s;carce fortitude it&s;elf could &s;uppre&s;s. Be|&s;ides, a journey of &s;eventy miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehen&s;ion, and the cries of the poor, who followed us for &s;ome miles, contributed to encrea&s;e it. The fir&s;t day's journey brought us in &s;afety within thirty miles of our future re|treat, and we put up for the night at an ob&s;cure inn in a village by the way. When we were &s;hewn a room, I de&s;ired the land|lord, in my u&s;ual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would encrea&s;e the bill next morning. He knew, however, the whole neighbourhood to which I was re|moving, particularly 'Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he de&s;cribed as one who de&s;ired to know little more of the world than the plea&s;ures it afforded, being particularly re|markable
<PB N="22" REF="25">
for his attachment to the fair &s;ex. He ob&s;erved that no virtue was able to re&s;i&s;t his arts and a&s;&s;iduity, and that &s;carce a farmer's daughter within ten miles round but what had found him &s;ucce&s;sful and faithle&s;s. Though this account gave me &s;ome pain, it had a very a different ef|fect upon my daughters, who&s;e features &s;eemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph, nor was my wife le&s;s plea&s;ed and confident of their allure|ments and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the ho&s;te&s;s entered the room to inform her hu&s;band, that the &s;trange gentleman, who had been two days in the hou&s;e, wanted money, and could not &s;atisfy them for his reckoning. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want money!"</Q> replied the ho&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible; for it was no later than ye&s;terday he paid three guineas to our beadle to &s;pare an old broken &s;ol|dier that was to be whipped through the town for dog-&s;tealing."</Q> The ho&s;te&s;s, however, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in her fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, he was preparing to leave the room, &s;wear|ing
<PB N="23" REF="26">
that he would be &s;atisfied one way or another, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a &s;tranger of &s;o much cha|rity as he de&s;cribed. With this he com|plied, &s;hewing in a gentleman who &s;eemed to be about thirty, dre&s;t in cloaths that once were laced. His per&s;on was well formed, though his face was marked with the lines of thinking. He had &s;omething &s;hort and dry in his addre&s;s, and &s;eemed not to under&s;tand ceremony, or to de&s;pi&s;e it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing my concern to the &s;tranger at &s;eeing a gentleman in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and offered him my pur&s;e to &s;atisfy the pre&s;ent demand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I take it with all my heart, Sir,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and am glad that a late over&s;ight in giv|ing what money I had about me, has &s;hewn me that there is &s;till &s;ome benevo|lence left among us. I mu&s;t, however, previou&s;ly entreat being informed of the name and re&s;idence of my benefactor, in order to remit it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible."</Q> In this I &s;atisfied him fully, not only men|tioning

my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"happens &s;till more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the &s;ame way my&s;elf, having been de|tained here two days by the floods, which, I hope, by to-morrow will be found pa&s;&s;able."</Q> I te&s;tified the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in his company, and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to &s;tay &s;upper. The &s;tran|ger's conver&s;ation, which was at once plea&s;|&s;ing and in&s;tructive, induced me to wi&s;h for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to retire and take refre&s;hment again&s;t the fatigues of the following day.</P>
<P>The next morning we all &s;et forward to|gether: my family on hor&s;eback, while Mr. Burchell, our new companion, walked along the foot-path by the road-&s;ide, ob|&s;erving, with a &s;mile, that as we were ill mounted, he would be too generous to at|tempt leaving us behind. As the floods were not yet &s;ub&s;ided, we were obliged to
<PB N="25" REF="28">
hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchell and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the road with philo&s;ophical di&s;putes, which he &s;eemed perfectly to under&s;tand. But what &s;ur|pri&s;ed me mo&s;t was, that though he was a money-borrower, he defended his opini|ons with as much ob&s;tinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then al&s;o informed me to whom the different &s;eats belonged that lay in our view as we tra|velled the road. <Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> cried he, point|ing to a very magnificent hou&s;e which &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely depen|dant on the will of his uncle, Sir Willam Thornhill, a gentleman, who content with a little him&s;elf, permits his nephew to en|joy the re&s;t, and chiefly re&s;ides in town."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What!"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is my young landlord then the nephew of a man who&s;e vir|tues, genero&s;ity, and &s;ingularities are &s;o univer&s;ally known?

He early began to aim at the qualifications of the &s;oldier and &s;cho|lar; was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed in the army, and had &s;ome reputation among men of learning. Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for &s;uch alone receive mo&s;t plea&s;ure from flattery. He was &s;ur|rounded with crowds, who &s;hewed him only one &s;ide of their character; &s;o that he began to lo&s;e a regard for private intere&s;t in univer&s;al &s;ympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were ra&s;cals. Phy&s;icians tell us of a di&s;order in which
<PB N="27" REF="30">
the whole body is &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;lighte&s;t touch gives pain: what &s;ome have thus &s;uffered in their per|&s;ons, this gentleman felt in his mind. The &s;lighte&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, whether real or fic|titious, touched him to the quick, and his &s;oul laboured under a &s;ickly &s;en&s;ibi|lity of the mi&s;eries of others. Thus di&s;|po&s;ed to relieve, it will be ea&s;ily conjec|tured, he found numbers di&s;po&s;ed to &s;o|licit: his profu&s;ions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature; that, indeed, was &s;een to encrea&s;e as the other &s;eemed to decay: he grew improvident as he grew poor; and though he talked like a man of &s;en&s;e, his actions were tho&s;e of a fool. Still, however, being &s;ur|rounded with importunity, and no lon|ger able to &s;atisfy every reque&s;t that was made him, in&s;tead of <HI>money</HI> he gave <HI>pro|mi&s;es.</HI> They were all he had to be&s;tow, and he had not re&s;olution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this means he drew round him crowds of de|pendants,
<PB N="28" REF="31">
whom he was &s;ure to di&s;ap|point; yet wi&s;hed to relieve. The&s;e hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became de&s;picable to him|&s;elf. His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that &s;upport taken away, he could find no plea&s;ure in the ap|plau&s;e of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence it&s;elf. The world now began to wear a different a&s;pect; the flat|tery of his friends began to dwindle into &s;imple approbation, that &s;oon took the more friendly form of advice, and ad|vice when rejected ever begets reproaches. He now found that &s;uch friends as bene|fits had gathered round him, were by no means the mo&s;t e&s;timable: it was now found that a man's own heart mu&s;t be ever given to gain that of another. I now found, that&mdash;but I forget what I was going to ob&s;erve: in &s;hort, &s;ir, he re&s;olved to re&s;pect him|&s;elf,

and laid down a plan of re&s;toring his &s;hattered fortune. For this pur|po&s;e, in his own whim&s;ical man|ner he travelled through Europe on foot, and before he attained the age of thirty, his circum&s;tances were more afflu|ent than ever. At pre&s;ent, therefore, his bounties are more rational and mo|derate than before; but &s;till he pre&s;erves the character of an humouri&s;t, and finds mo&s;t plea&s;ure in eccentric virtues."</Q></P>
<P>My attention was &s;o much taken up by Mr. Burchell's account, that I &s;carce looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my fami|ly, when turning, I perceived my young|e&s;t daughter in the mid&s;t of a rapid &s;tream, thrown from her hor&s;e, and &s;trug|gling with the torrent. She had &s;unk twice, nor was it in my power to di&s;en|gage my&s;elf in time to bring her relief. My &s;en&s;ations were even too violent to
<PB N="30" REF="33">
permit my attempting her re&s;cue: &s;he would have certainly peri&s;hed had not my companion, percieving her danger, in&s;tantly plunged in to her relief, and, with &s;ome difficulty, brought her in &s;afety to the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore. By taking the current a little farther up, the re&s;t of the family got &s;afely over; where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to her's. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than de&s;cribed: &s;he thanked her deliverer more with looks than words, and conti|nued to lean upon his arm, as if &s;till willing to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My wife al&s;o hoped one day to have the plea&s;ure of returning his kindne&s;s at her own hou&s;e. Thus, after we were all refre&s;hed at the next inn, and had dined together, as he was going to a different part of the country, he took leave; and we pur&s;ued our journey. My wife ob&s;erv|ing as we went, that &s;he liked Mr. Bur|chell extremely, and prote&s;ting, that if he had birth and fortune to entitle him to match into &s;uch a family as our's, &s;he knew

no man &s;he would &s;ooner fix upon. I could not but &s;mile to hear her talk in this &s;train: one almo&s;t at the verge of beggary thus to a&s;&s;ume language of the mo&s;t in&s;ulting affluence, might excite the ridicule of ill-nature; but I was never much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e innocent delu|&s;ions that tend to make us more happy.</P>

<P>A proof that even the humble&s;t for|tune may grant happine&s;s and delight, which depend not on circum&s;tance, but con&s;titution.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE place of our new retreat was in a little neighbourhood, con&s;i&s;ting of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal &s;trangers to opulence and poverty. As they had almo&s;t all the con|veniencies of life within them&s;elves, they &s;eldom vi&s;ited towns or cities in &s;earch of &s;uperfluity. Remote from the polite, they &s;till retained a primaeval &s;implicity of man|ners, and frugal by long habit, &s;carce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with chearfulne&s;s on days of la|bour; but ob&s;erved fe&s;tivals as intervals of idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure. They kept up the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
Chri&s;tmas carol, &s;ent true love-knots on Valentine morning, eat pancakes on Shrove|tide, &s;hewed their wit on the fir&s;t of April, and religiou&s;ly cracked nuts on Michael|mas eve. Being apprized of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their mini&s;ter, dre&s;t in their fine&s;t cloaths, and preceded by a pipe and tabor: al&s;o a fea&s;t was provided for our reception, at which we &s;at chearfully down; and what the conver&s;ation wanted in wit, we made up in laughter.</P>
<P>Our little habitation was &s;ituated at the foot of a &s;loping hill, &s;heltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prat|ling river before; on one &s;ide a meadow, on the other a green. My farm con&s;i&s;ted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given an hundred pound for my predece&s;&s;or's good-will. Nothing could ex|ceed the neatne&s;s of my little enclo&s;ures: the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpre&s;&s;ible beauty. My hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of but one &s;tory, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great &s;nug|ne&s;s;
<PB N="35" REF="37">
the walls on the in&s;ide were nicely white-wa&s;hed, and my daughters undertook to adorn them with pictures of their own de&s;igning. Though the &s;ame room &s;erved us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Be&s;ides, as it was kept with the utmo&s;t neatne&s;s, the di&s;hes, plates, and coppers, being well &s;coured, and all di&s;|po&s;ed in bright rows on the &s;helves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not &s;eem to want rich furniture. There were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters, within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the re&s;t of my children.</P>
<P>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulated in the following manner: by &s;un-ri&s;e we all a&s;&s;embled in our common appartment; the fire being previou&s;ly kindled by the &s;ervant. After we had &s;a|luted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to keep up &s;ome mechanical forms of good breeding, with|out which freedom ever de&s;troys friend&s;hip,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my &s;on and I went to pur&s;ue our u&s;ual indu&s;try abroad, while my wife and daughters employed them&s;elves in pro|viding breakfa&s;t, which was always ready at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in innocent mirth be|tween my wife and daughters, and in phi|lo&s;ophical arguments between my &s;on and me.</P>
<P>As we ro&s;e with the &s;un, &s;o we never pur&s;ued our labours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family; where &s;miling looks, a neat hearth, and plea&s;ant fire, were prepared for our recep|tion. Nor were we without other gue&s;ts: &s;ometimes farmer Flamborough, our talk|ative neighbour, and often the blind piper, would pay us a vi&s;it, and ta&s;te our goo&s;e|berry wine; for the making of which we had lo&s;t neither the receipt nor the reputa|tion. The&s;e harmle&s;s people had &s;everal
<PB N="37" REF="39">
ways of being good company, while one played the pipes, another would &s;ing &s;ome &s;oothing ballad, Johnny Arm&s;trong's la&s;t good-night, or the cruelty of Barbara Al|len. The night was concluded in the man|ner we began the morning, my younge&s;t boys being appointed to read the le&s;&s;ons of the day, and he that read loude&s;t, di&s;tinct|e&s;t, and be&s;t, was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor's box.</P>
<P>When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery, which all my &s;umptuary edicts could not re&s;train. How well &s;o ever I fancied my lectures again&s;t pride had con|quered the vanity of my daughters; yet I &s;till found them &s;ecretly attached to all their former finery: they &s;till loved laces, ribbands, bugles and catgut; my wife her|&s;elf retained a pa&s;&s;ion for her crim&s;on pa|dua&s;oy, becau&s;e I formerly happened to &s;ay it became her.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Sunday in particular their beha|viour &s;erved to mortify me: I had de&s;ired my
<PB N="38" REF="40">
girls the preceding night to be dre&s;t early the next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the re&s;t of the congregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were to a&s;|&s;emble in the morning at breakfa&s;t, down came my wife and daughters, dre&s;t out in all their former &s;plendour: their hair plai&s;|tered up with pomatum, their faces patched to ta&s;te, their trains bundled up into an heap behind, and ru&s;tling at every mo|tion. I could not help &s;miling at their va|nity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I expected more di&s;cretion. In this exigence, therefore, my only re&s;ource was to order my &s;on, with an important air, to call our coach. The girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more &s;olemnity than before.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Surely, my dear, you je&s;t,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we can walk it perfectly well: we want no coach to carry us now."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mi&s;|take, child,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this trim, the very children in the pari&s;h

No, my children,"</Q> continued I, more gravely, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tho&s;e gowns may be altered into &s;ome|thing of a plainer cut; for finery is very unbecoming in us, who want the means of decency.

<P>This remon&s;trance had the proper ef|fect; they went with great compo&s;ure,

that very in&s;tant, to change their dre&s;s; and the next day I had the &s;atisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own reque&s;t employed in cutting up their trains into Sunday wai&s;tcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones, and what was &s;till more &s;a|tisfactory, the gowns &s;eemed improved by being thus curtailed.</P>

<P>A new and great acquaintance intro|duced. <HI>What we place mo&s;t hopes upon, generally proves mo&s;t fatal.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT a &s;mall di&s;tance from the hou&s;e my predece&s;&s;or had made a &s;eat, over|&s;haded by an hedge of hawthorn and ho|ney&s;uckle. Here, when the weather was fine, and our labour &s;oon fini&s;hed, we u&s;u|ally all &s;ate together, to enjoy an exten|&s;ive land&s;chape, in the calm of the evening. Here too we drank tea, which now was become an occa&s;ional banquet; and as we had it but &s;eldom, it diffu&s;ed a new joy, the preparations for it being made with no &s;mall &s;hare of bu&s;tle and ceremony. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, our two little ones al|ways read for us, and they were regularly &s;erved after we had done. Sometimes, to give a variety to our amu&s;ements, the girls
<PB N="42" REF="44">
&s;ung to the guitar; and while they thus formed a little concert, my wife and I would &s;troll down the &s;loping field, that was embelli&s;hed with blue bells and cen|taury, talk of our children with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony.</P>
<P>In this manner we began to find that every &s;ituation in life might bring its own peculiar plea&s;ures: every morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity.</P>
<P>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept &s;uch as intervals of relaxation from labour, that I had drawn out my family to our u&s;ual place of amu&s;e|ment, and our young mu&s;icians began their u&s;ual concert. As we were thus engaged, we &s;aw a &s;tag bound nimbly by, within about twenty paces of where we were &s;it|ting, and by its panting, it &s;eemed pre&s;t by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
when we perceived the dogs and hor&s;emen come &s;weeping along at &s;ome di&s;tance be|hind, and making the very path it had taken. I was in&s;tantly for returning in with my family; but either curio&s;ity or &s;urprize, or &s;ome more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their &s;eats. The hunt&s;|man, who rode foremo&s;t, pa&s;t us with great &s;wiftne&s;s, followed by four or five per&s;ons more, who &s;eemed in equal ha&s;te. At la&s;t, a young gentleman of a more genteel ap|pearance than the re&s;t, came forward, and for a while regarding us, in&s;tead of pur&s;u|ing the chace, &s;topt &s;hort, and giving his hor&s;e to a &s;ervant who attended, approach|ed us with a carele&s;s &s;uperior air. He &s;eemed to want no introduction, but was going to &s;alute my daughters as one cer|tain of a kind reception; but they had early learnt the le&s;&s;on of looking pre&s;ump|tion out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thorn|hill, and that he was owner of the e&s;tate that lay for &s;ome extent round us. He again, therefore, offered to &s;alute the fe|male
<PB N="44" REF="46">
part of the family, and &s;uch was the power of fortune and fine cloaths, that he found no &s;econd repul&s;e. As his addre&s;s, though confident, was ea&s;y, we &s;oon be|came more familiar; and perceiving mu|&s;ical in&s;truments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a &s;ong. As I did not ap|prove of &s;uch di&s;proportioned acquain|tances, I winked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mo|ther; &s;o that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite &s;ong of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill &s;eemed highly delighted with their per|formance and choice, and then took up the guitar him&s;elf. He played but very indif|ferently; however, my elde&s;t daughter re|paid his former applau&s;e with intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;ured him that his tones were louder than even tho&s;e of her ma&s;ter. At this com|pliment he bowed, which &s;he returned with a curte&s;y. He prai&s;ed her ta&s;te, and &s;he commended his under&s;tanding: an age could not have made them better acquaint|ed. While the fond mother too, equally
<PB N="45" REF="47">
happy, in&s;i&s;ted upon her landlord's &s;tepping in, and ta&s;ting a gla&s;s of her goo&s;eberry. The whole family &s;eemed earne&s;t to plea&s;e him: my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought mo&s;t modern, while Mo&s;es, on the contrary, gave him a que&s;tion or two from the ancients, for which he had the &s;atisfaction of being laughed at; for he always a&s;cribed to his wit that laughter which was lavi&s;hed at his &s;implicity: my little ones were no le&s;s bu|&s;y, and fondly &s;tuck clo&s;e to the &s;tranger. All my endeavours could &s;carce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarni&s;hing the lace on his cloaths, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes, to &s;ee what was there. At the approach of evening he took leave; but not till he had reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to renew his vi&s;it, which, as he was our landlord, we mo&s;t readily agreed to.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion, that it was a mo&s;t fortu|nate

<P>AS we carried on the former di&s;pute with &s;ome degree of warmth, in or|der to accommodate matters, it was univer|&s;ally concluded upon, that we &s;hould have a part of the veni&s;on for &s;upper, and the girls undertook the ta&s;k with alacrity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that we have no neighbour or &s;tranger to take a part in this good cheer: fea&s;ts of this kind ac|quire a double reli&s;h from ho&s;pitality."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here comes our good friend Mr. Burchell, that &s;aved our Sophia, and that run you down fairly in the argument."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Confute me in argument, child!"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mi&s;take there, my dear.

your abilities at making a goo&s;e-pye, and I beg you'll leave argument to me."</Q>&mdash;As I &s;poke, poor Mr. Burchell entered the hou&s;e, and was welcomed by the family, who &s;hook him heartily by the hand, while little Dick officiou&s;ly reached him a chair.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed with the poor man's friend|&s;hip for two rea&s;ons; becau&s;e I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the cha|racter of the poor Gentleman that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet above thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good &s;en&s;e; but in general he was fonde&s;t of the company of children, whom he u&s;ed to call harmle&s;s little men. He was famous, I found, for &s;inging them ballads, and telling them &s;to|ries; and &s;eldom went without &s;omething in his pockets for them, a piece of ginger|bread, or a halfpenny whi&s;tle. He gene|rally came into our neighbourhood once a

year, and lived upon the neighbours ho&s;|pitality. He &s;ate down to &s;upper among us, and my wife was not &s;paring of her goo&s;eberry wine. The tale went round; he &s;ung us old &s;ongs, and gave the chil|dren the &s;tory of the Buck of Beverland, with the hi&s;tory of Patient Gri&s;&s;el. The adventures of Cat&s;kin next entertained them, and then Fair Ro&s;amond's bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repo&s;e; but an unfore&s;een difficulty &s;tarted about lod|ging the &s;tranger: all our beds were al|ready taken up, and it was too late to &s;end him to the next alehou&s;e. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother Mo&s;es would let him lie with him; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I,"</Q> cried Bill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my &s;i&s;ters will take me to theirs."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well done, my good children,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ho&s;pitality is one of the fir&s;t chri&s;tian duties.

greate&s;t &s;tranger in this world, was he that came to &s;ave it. He never had an hou&s;e, as if willing to &s;ee what ho&s;pita|lity was left remaining among&s;t us.

<P>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at &s;aving an after-growth of hay, and our gue&s;t offering his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly, we turned the &s;wath to the wind, I went foremo&s;t, and the re&s;t followed in due &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I could not avoid, however, ob&s;erving the a&s;&s;idu|ity of Mr. Burchell in a&s;&s;i&s;ting my daugh|ter Sophia in her part of the ta&s;k. When he had fini&s;hed his own, he would join in her's, and enter into a clo&s;e conver&s;ation: but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's under&s;tanding, and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any unea&s;i|ne&s;s from a man of broken fortune.
<PB N="53" REF="55">
When we were fini&s;hed for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refu&s;ed, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's, to who&s;e child he was carrying a whi&s;tle. When gone, our con|ver&s;ation at &s;upper turned upon our late un|fortunate gue&s;t. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What a &s;trong in|&s;tance,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is that poor man of the mi&s;eries attending a youth of levity and extravagance.

<P>A town wit de&s;cribed. The dulle&s;t fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed what provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted to make an ap|pearance. It may al&s;o be conjectured that my wife and daughters expanded their gay|e&s;t plumage upon this occa&s;ion. Mr. Thorn|hill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder. The &s;ervants, who were numerous, he politely ordered to the next ale-hou&s;e: but my wife, in the tri|umph of her heart, in&s;i&s;ted on entertaining them all; for which, by the bye, the family was pinched for three weeks after. As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day be|fore,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
that he was making &s;ome propo&s;als of marriage to Mi&s;s Wilmot, my &s;on George's former mi&s;tre&s;s, this a good deal damped the heartine&s;s of his reception: but acci|dent, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relieved our em|barra&s;ment; for one of the company hap|pening to mention her name, Mr. Thorn|hill ob&s;erved with an oath, that he never knew any thing more ab&s;urd than calling &s;uch a fright a beauty: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For &s;trike me ugly,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I &s;hould not find as much plea&s;ure in choo&s;ing my mi&s;tre&s;s by the information of a lamp under the clock at St. Dun&s;tan's."</Q> At this he laugh|ed, and &s;o did we:&mdash;the je&s;ts of the rich are ever &s;ucce&s;sful. Olivia too could not avoid whi&s;pering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour.</P>
<P>After dinner, I began with my u&s;ual toa&s;t, the Church; for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he &s;aid the church was the only mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come tell us hone&s;tly, Frank,"</Q> &s;aid the

No, &s;ir, there I prote&s;t you are too hard for me."</Q> This effectually rai&s;ed the laugh again&s;t poor Mo&s;es, who &s;ate the only di&s;|mal
<PB N="62" REF="64">
figure in a groupe of merry faces: nor did he offer a &s;ingle &s;yllable more during the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>But though all this gave me no plea&s;ure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who mi&s;took this humour, which was a mere act of the memory, for real wit. She thought him therefore a very fine gentle|man; and &s;uch as con&s;ider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine cloaths, and fortune, are in that character, will ea&s;ily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill, notwith|&s;tanding his real ignorance, talked with ea&s;e, and could expatiate upon the common topics of conver&s;ation with fluency. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing then that &s;uch talents &s;hould win the affections of a girl, who by educa|tion was taught to value an appearance in her&s;elf, and con&s;equently to &s;et a value up|on it when found in another.</P>
<P>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and
<PB N="63" REF="65">
conver&s;ation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that &s;he was the object that induced him to be our vi&s;itor. Nor did &s;he &s;eem to be much di&s;plea&s;ed at the in|nocent raillery of her brother and &s;i&s;ter up|on this occa&s;ion. Even Deborah her&s;elf &s;eemed to &s;hare the glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, my dear,"</Q> cried &s;he to me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll fairly own, that it was I that in&s;tructed my girls to encou|rage our landlord's addre&s;&s;es. I had al|ways &s;ome ambition, and you now &s;ee that I was right; for who knows how this may end?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, who knows that indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered I, with a groan: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for my part I don't much like it; and I could have been better plea&s;ed with one that was poor and hone&s;t, than this fine gen|tleman with his fortune and infidelity; for depend on't, if he be what I &s;u&s;pect him, no free-thinker &s;hall ever have a child of mine."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sure, father,"</Q> cried Mo&s;es, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are too &s;evere in this; for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does. Every man has a thou|&s;and vicious thoughts, which ari&s;e with|out his power to &s;uppre&s;s. Thinking freely of religion, may be involuntary with this gentleman: &s;o that allowing his &s;entiments to be wrong, yet as he is purely pa&s;&s;ive in their reception, he is no more to be blamed for their incur|&s;ions than the governor of a city without walls for the &s;helter he is obliged to af|ford an invading enemy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"True, my &s;on,"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but if the governor invites the enemy, there he is ju&s;tly culpable. And &s;uch is always the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who embrace error. The vice does not lie in a&s;&s;enting to the proofs they &s;ee; but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer. Like corrupt judges on a bench, they deter|mine right on that part of the evidence they hear; but they will not hear all the
<PB N="65" REF="67">
evidence. Thus, my &s;on, though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we de&s;erve puni&s;hment for our vice, or contempt for our folly."</Q></P>
<P>My wife now kept up the conver&s;ation, though not the argument: &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;everal very prudent men of our ac|quaintance were free-thinkers, and made very good hu&s;bands; and &s;he knew &s;ome &s;en&s;ible girls that had &s;kill enough to make converts of their &s;pou&s;es: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And who knows, my dear,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what Olivia may be able to do. The girl has a great deal to &s;ay upon every &s;ubject, and to my knowledge is very well &s;killed in controver&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my dear, what controver&s;y can &s;he have read?"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It does not occur to my memory that I ever put &s;uch books into her hands: you certainly over-rate her merit."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, pappa,"</Q>

<P>THE next morning we were again vi|&s;ited by Mr. Burchell, though I be|gan, for certain rea&s;ons, to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the frequency of his return; but I could not refu&s;e him my company and fire-&s;ide. It is true his labour more than requited his entertainment; &s;or he wrought among us with vigour, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick put him&s;elf foremo&s;t. Be&s;ides, he had always &s;ome|thing amu&s;ing to &s;ay that le&s;&s;ened our toil, and was at once &s;o out of the way, and yet &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only di&s;like aro&s;e from an attachment he di&s;covered to my daughter: he would, in a je&s;ting manner,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
call her his little mi&s;tre&s;s, and when he bought each of the girls a &s;et of ribbands, hers was the fine&s;t. I knew not how, but he every day &s;eemed to become more ami|able, his wit to improve, and his &s;implicity to a&s;&s;ume the &s;uperior airs of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Our family dined in the field, and we &s;ate, or rather reclined, round a temperate repa&s;t, our cloth &s;pread upon the hay, while Mr. Burchell &s;eemed to give chear|fulne&s;s to the fea&s;t. To heighten our &s;ati&s;|faction two blackbirds an&s;wered each other from oppo&s;ite hedges, the familiar red|brea&s;t came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every &s;ound &s;eemed but the echo of tranquillity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never &s;it thus,"</Q> &s;ays Sophia, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I think of the two lovers, &s;o &s;weetly de&s;cribed by Mr. Gay, who were &s;truck dead in each other's arms under a barley mow.

While this ballad was reading, Sophia &s;eemed to mix an air of tenderne&s;s with her approbation. But our tranquillity was &s;oon di&s;turbed by the report of a gun ju&s;t by us, and immediately after a man was &s;een bur&s;ting through the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This &s;port&s;man was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had &s;hot one of the blackbirds that &s;o agreeably entertained us. So loud a re|port, and &s;o near, &s;tartled my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown her&s;elf into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection. The gentleman came up, and a&s;ked pardon for having di&s;turbed us, affirming that he was ignorant of our being &s;o near. He therefore &s;ate down by my younge&s;t daughter, and, &s;port&s;man like, offered her what he had killed that morn|ing. She was going to refu&s;e, but a pri|vate look from her mother &s;oon induced her to correct the mi&s;take, and accept his pre&s;ent, though with &s;ome reluctance. My wife, as u&s;ual, di&s;covered her pride in a whi&s;per, ob&s;erving, that Sophy had

made a conque&s;t of the chaplain, as well as her &s;i&s;ter had of the 'Squire. I &s;u&s;pected, however, with more proba|bility, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chap|lain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided mu&s;ic and refre&s;hments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moon|light, on the gra&s;s-plot before our door. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor can I deny,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I have an intere&s;t in being fir&s;t to deliver this me&s;&s;age, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with mi&s;s Sophy's hand as a partner."</Q> To this my girl re|plied, that &s;he &s;hould have no objection, if &s;he could do it with honour: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But here,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is a gentleman,"</Q> looking at Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who has been my com|panion in the ta&s;k for the day, and it is fit he &s;hould &s;hare in its amu&s;ements."</Q> Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions; but re&s;igned her up to the chaplain, adding that he was to go that night five miles, being invited

His refu&s;al appeared to me a little extraordinary, nor could I con|ceive how &s;o &s;en&s;ible a girl as my younge&s;t, could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune to a &s;prightly young fellow of twenty-two. But as men are mo&s;t capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing merit in women, &s;o the ladies often form the true&s;t judgments upon us.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Two ladies of great di&s;tinction introduced. Superior finery ever &s;eems to confer &s;u|perior breeding.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Burchell had &s;carce taken leave, and Sophia con&s;ented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the 'Squire was come, with a crowd of company. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly dre&s;t, whom he introduced as women of very great di&s;tinction and fa&s;hi|on from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately propo&s;ed that every gentleman &s;hould &s;it in a lady's lap.
<PB N="82" REF="84">
This I po&s;itively objected to, notwith&s;tand|ing a look of di&s;approbation from my wife. Mo&s;es was therefore di&s;patched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies al&s;o to make up a &s;et at country dances, the two gentlemen went with him in que&s;t of a couple of partners. Chairs and partners were &s;oon provided. The gentlemen returned with my neigh|bour Flamborough's ro&s;y daughters, flaunt|ing with red top-knots. But there was an unlucky circum&s;tance which was not adverted to; though the Mi&s;s Flambo|roughs were reckoned the very be&s;t dan|cers in the pari&s;h, and under&s;tood the jig and the round-about to perfection; yet they were totally unacquainted with country dances. This at fir&s;t di&s;compo&s;ed us: however, after a little &s;hoving and drag|ging, they began to go merrily on. Our mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ted of two fiddles, with a pipe and tabor. The moon &s;hone bright, Mr. Thornhill and my elde&s;t daughter led up the ball, to the great delight of the
<PB N="83" REF="85">
&s;pectators; for the neighbours hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My girl moved with &s;o much grace and vi|vacity, that my wife could not avoid di&s;co|vering the pride of her heart, by a&s;&s;uring me, that though the little chit did it &s;o cle|verly, all the &s;teps were &s;tolen from her&s;elf. The ladies of the town &s;trove hard to be equally ea&s;y, but without &s;ucce&s;s. They &s;wam, &s;prawled, langui&s;hed, and fri&s;ked; but all would not do: the gazers in|deed owned that it was fine; but neighbour Flamborough ob&s;erved, that Mi&s;s Livy's feet &s;eemed as pat to the mu&s;ic as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehen|&s;ive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expre&s;|&s;ed her &s;entiments upon this occa&s;ion in a very coar&s;e manner, when &s;he ob&s;erved, that by the <HI>living jingo,</HI> &s;he was all of a muck of &s;weat. Upon our return to the hou&s;e, we found a very elegant cold &s;upper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought
<PB N="84" REF="86">
with him. The conver&s;ation at this time was more re&s;erved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the &s;hade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high lived company; with other fa&s;hionable to|pics, &s;uch as pictures, ta&s;te, Shake&s;pear, and the mu&s;ical gla&s;&s;es. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us &s;en&s;ibly by &s;lipping out an oath; but that appeared to me as the &s;ure&s;t &s;ymptom of their di&s;tinction, (tho' I am &s;ince informed &s;wearing is now perfectly unfa&s;hi|onable.) Their finery, however, threw a veil over any gro&s;&s;ne&s;s in their conver&s;ation. My daughters &s;eemed to regard their &s;uperior ac|compli&s;hments with envy; and what appeared ami&s;s was a&s;cribed to tip-top quality breed|ing. But the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the ladies was &s;till &s;uperior to their other accompli&s;hments. One of them ob&s;erved, that had mi&s;s Oli|via &s;een a little more of the world, it would greatly improve her. To which the other added, that a &s;ingle winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly a&s;&s;ented to both; adding,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
that there was nothing &s;he more ardently wi&s;hed than to give her girls a &s;ingle win|ter's poli&s;hing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already &s;uperior to their fortune; and that greater refinement would only &s;erve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures they had no right to po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And what plea&s;ures,"</Q> cried Mr. Thornhill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do they not de&s;erve, who have &s;o much in their power to be&s;tow?

We talked of the plea&s;ures of temperance, and the &s;un-&s;hine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was well plea&s;ed that my little ones were kept up beyond the u&s;ual time to be edified by &s;uch good conver&s;ation.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance, &s;im|plicity, and contentment, were entirely di&s;|regarded. The di&s;tinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid a&s;leep, but not removed. Our windows now again, as formerly, were filled with wa&s;hes for the neck and face. The &s;un was dreaded as an enemy to the &s;kin without doors, and the fire as a &s;poiler of the complexion within. My wife ob&s;erved, that ri&s;ing too early would hurt her daugh|ter's eyes, that working after dinner would redden their no&s;es, and convinced me that
<PB N="90" REF="92">
the hands never looked &s;o white as when they did nothing. In&s;tead therefore of fi|ni&s;hing George's &s;hirts, we now had them new modelling their old gauzes, or flouri&s;h|ing upon catgut. The poor Mi&s;s Flambo|roughs, their former gay companions, were ca&s;t off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conver&s;ation ran upon high life and high lived company, with pictures, ta&s;te, Shake&s;pear, and the mu&s;ical gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune-telling gyp&s;ey come to rai&s;e us into perfect &s;ublimity. The tawny &s;ybil no &s;ooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a &s;hilling a piece to cro&s;s her hand with &s;ilver. To &s;ay the truth, I was tired of being always wi&s;e, and could not help gratifying their reque&s;t, becau&s;e I loved to &s;ee them happy. I gave each of them a &s;hilling; though, for the honour of the fa|mily, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that they never went without money them&s;elves, as my wife always generou&s;ly let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets; but with &s;trict
<PB N="91" REF="93">
injunctions never to change it. After they had been clo&s;etted up with the fortune-teller for &s;ome time, I knew by their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promi&s;ed &s;omething great.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, my girls, how have you &s;ped? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune-teller given thee a pennyworth?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I prote&s;t, pappa,"</Q> &s;ays the girl, with a &s;erious face, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I be|lieve &s;he deals with &s;ome body that's not right; for &s;he po&s;itively declared, that I am to be married to a great 'Squire in le&s;s than a twelvemonth?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well now, Sophy, my child,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and what &s;ort of a hu&s;band are you to have?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am to have a Lord &s;oon after my &s;i&s;ter has been married to the 'Squire."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">How,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is that all you are to have for your two &s;hil|lings! Only a Lord and a 'Squire for two &s;hillings! You fools, I could have promi&s;ed you a Prince and a Nabob for half the money."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
This curio&s;ity of theirs, however, was at|tended with very &s;erious effects: we now began to think our&s;elves de&s;igned by the &s;tars for &s;omething exalted, and already an|ticipated our future grandeur.</P>
<P>It has been a thou&s;and times ob&s;erved, and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve it once more, that the hours we pa&s;s with happy pro&s;pects in view, are more plea&s;ing than tho&s;e crowned with fruition. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e we cook the di&s;h to our own appetite; in the latter nature cooks it for us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more ri&s;ing; and as the whole pari&s;h a&s;&s;erted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter, &s;he was ac|tually &s;o with him; for they per&s;uaded her into pa&s;&s;ion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the mo&s;t lucky dreams in the world, which &s;he took care to tell us every morning, with great &s;olemnity and exact|ne&s;s. It was one night a coffin and cro&s;s

bones, the &s;ign of an approaching wedding: at another time &s;he imagined her daugh|ter's pockets filled with farthings, a certain &s;ign of their being one day &s;tuffed with gold. The girls had their omens too: they felt &s;trange ki&s;&s;es on their lips; they &s;aw rings in the candle, pur&s;es bounced from the fire, and true love-knots lurked at the bottom of every tea-cup.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the week we receiv|ed a card from the town ladies; in which, with their compliments, they hoped to &s;ee all our family at church the Sunday follow|ing. All Saturday morning I could per|ceive, in con&s;equence of this, my wife and daughters in clo&s;e conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be &s;incere, I had &s;trong &s;u&s;picions that &s;ome ab&s;urd propo&s;al was preparing for appearing with &s;plendor the next day. In the evening they began their operations in a very regular man|ner, and my wife undertook to conduct the
<PB N="94" REF="96">
&s;iege. After tea, when I &s;eemed in &s;pirits, &s;he began thus.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we &s;hall have a great deal of good compa|ny at our church to-morrow."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps we may, my dear,"</Q> returned I; though <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you need be under no unea&s;ine&s;s about that, you &s;hall have a &s;ermon whether there be or not."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That is what I expect,"</Q> returned &s;he; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as po&s;|&s;ible, for who knows what may happen?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your precautions,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are high|ly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We &s;hould be devout and humble, chearful and &s;erene."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried &s;he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know that; but I mean we &s;hould go there in as proper a manner as po&s;&s;ible; not altogether like the &s;crubs about us."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are quite right, my dear,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I was going to make the very &s;ame propo&s;al. The proper manner of going is, to go there as early as po&s;&s;ible, to have time for meditation before the
<PB N="95" REF="97">
&s;ervice begins."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Phoo, Charles,"</Q> interrupted &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all that is very true; but not what I would be at. I mean, we &s;hould go there genteelly. You know the church is two miles off, and I prote&s;t I don't like to &s;ee my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a &s;mock race. Now, my dear, my propo&s;al is this: there are our two plow hor&s;es, the Colt that has been in our family the&s;e nine years, and his companion Black|berry, that have &s;carce done an earthly thing for this month pa&s;t, and are both grown fat and lazy. Why &s;hould not they do &s;omething as well as we? And let me tell you, when Mo&s;es has trimmed them a little, they will not be &s;o con|temptible."</Q></P>
<P>To this propo&s;al I objected, that walk|ing would be twenty times more genteel than &s;uch a paltry conveyance, as Black|berry was wall-eyed, and the Colt wanted a
<PB N="96" REF="98">
tail: that they had never been broke to the rein; but had an hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one &s;addle and pillion in the whole hou&s;e. All the&s;e objections, however, were over-ruled; &s;o that I was obliged to comply. The next morning I perceived them not a little bu&s;y in collecting &s;uch materials as might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the expedition; but as I found it would be a bu&s;ine&s;s of much time, I walked on to the church before, and they promi&s;ed &s;peedily to follow. I waited near an hour in the reading de&s;k for their arrival; but not finding them come as expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the &s;er|vice, not without &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at find|ing them ab&s;ent. This was encrea&s;ed when all was fini&s;hed, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back by the hor&s;e-way, which was five miles round, tho' the foot-way was but two, and when got about half way home, perceived the proce&s;|&s;ion marching &s;lowly forward towards the church; my &s;on, my wife, and the two
<PB N="97" REF="99">
little ones exalted upon one hor&s;e, and my two daughters upon the other. I demand|ed the cau&s;e of their delay; but I &s;oon found by their looks they had met with a thou&s;and misfortunes on the road. The hor&s;es had at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to move from the door, till Mr. Burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next the &s;traps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to &s;top to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the hor&s;es took it into his head to &s;tand &s;till, and neither blows nor entreaties could pre|vail with him to proceed. It was ju&s;t re|covering from this di&s;mal &s;ituation that I found them; but perceiving every thing &s;afe, I own their pre&s;ent mortification did not much di&s;plea&s;e me, as it might give me many opportunities of future triumph, and teach my daughters more humility.</P>

<P>The family &s;till re&s;olve to hold up their heads.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MICHAELMAS eve happening on the next day, we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have rejected &s;uch an invitation with contempt: however, we &s;uffered our|&s;elves to be happy. Our hone&s;t neigh|bour's goo&s;e and dumplings were fine, and the lamb's-wool, even in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoi&s;eur, was thought excellent. It is true, his man|ner of telling &s;tories was not quite &s;o well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about him&s;elf, and we had laughed at
<PB N="100" REF="101">
them ten times before: however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of &s;eeing &s;ome innocent amu&s;e|ment going forward, and &s;et the boys and girls to blind man's buff. My wife too was per&s;uaded to join in the diver&s;ion, and it gave me plea&s;ure to think &s;he was not yet too old. In the mean time, my neighbour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and prai&s;|ed our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles &s;ucceeded next, que&s;tions and commands followed that, and la&s;t of all, they &s;ate down to hunt the &s;lipper. As every per|&s;on may not be acquainted with this primaeval pa&s;time, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the company at this play plant them&s;elves in a ring upon the ground, all, except one who &s;tands in the middle, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to catch a &s;hoe, which the company &s;hove about under their hams from one to another, &s;omething like a weaver's &s;huttle. As it is impo&s;&s;ible, in this ca&s;e, for the lady who
<PB N="101" REF="102">
is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the &s;hoe on that &s;ide lea&s;t capable of making a defence. It was in this manner that my elde&s;t daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in &s;pirits, and bawling for fair play, fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad &s;inger, when confu&s;ion on confu&s;ion, who &s;hould enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarney and Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs! De&s;cription would but beggar, therefore it is unnece&s;&s;ary to de|&s;cribe this new mortification Death! To be &s;een by ladies of &s;uch high breeding in &s;uch vulgar attitudes!. Nothing better could en&s;ue from &s;uch a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's propo&s;ing. We &s;eemed &s;tuck to the ground for &s;ome time, as if actually petrified with amazement.</P>
<P>The two ladies had been at our hou&s;e to &s;ee us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were unea&s;y to know
<PB N="102" REF="103">
what accident could have kept us from church the day before. Olivia undertook to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a &s;ummary way, only &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We were thrown from our hor&s;es."</Q> At which ac|count the ladies were greatly concerned; but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad: but being in|formed that we were almo&s;t killed by the fright, they were va&s;tly &s;orry; but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could ex|ceed their complai&s;ance to my daughters; their profe&s;&s;ions the la&s;t evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They prote&s;ted a de&s;ire of having a more la&s;ting acquain|tance. Lady Blarney was particularly at|tached to Olivia; Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her &s;i&s;ter. They &s;upported the conver&s;ation between them&s;elves, while my daughters &s;ate &s;ilent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly him&s;elf, is
<PB N="103" REF="104">
fond of high-lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords, Ladies, and Knights of the Gar|ter, I mu&s;t beg leave to give him the con|cluding part of the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All that I know of the matter,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Skeggs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true: but this I can a&s;|&s;ure your Lady&s;hip, that the whole rout was in amaze; his Lord&s;hip turned all manner of colours, my Lady fell into a &s;woon; but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his &s;word, &s;wore he was her's to the la&s;t drop of his blood."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> replied our Peere&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this I can &s;ay, that the Dutche&s;s never told me a &s;yllable of the matter, and I be|lieve her Grace would keep nothing a &s;e|cret from me. But this you may de|pend upon as fact, that the next morn|ing my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre, Jerni|gan, Jernigan, Jernigan, bring me my garters."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
But previou&s;ly I &s;hould have mentioned the very impolite behaviour of Mr. Bur|chell, who, during this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ate with his face turned to the fire, and at the con|clu&s;ion of every &s;entence would cry out <HI>fudge,</HI> an expre&s;&s;ion which di&s;plea&s;ed us all, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure damped the ri&s;ing &s;pirit of the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be&s;ides, my dear Skeggs,"</Q> continued our Peere&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">there is nothing of this in the copy of ver&s;es that Dr. Burdock made upon the occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;urpri&s;ed at that,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Skeggs;" <Q REND="inline margQuotes">for he &s;eldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his own amu&s;e|ment. But can your Lady&s;hip favour me with a &s;ight of them?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear creature,"</Q> replied our Peere&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do you think I carry &s;uch things about me? Though they are very fine to be &s;ure, and I think my&s;elf &s;omething of a judge; at lea&s;t I know what plea&s;es my|&s;elf.
<PB N="105" REF="106">
Indeed I was ever an admirer of all Doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except what he does, and our dear Coun|te&s;s at Hanover-Square, there's nothing comes out but the mo&s;t lowe&s;t &s;tuff in nature; not a bit of high life among them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your Lady&s;hip &s;hould except,"</Q> &s;ays t'other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll &s;ay there's no|thing low lived there? But I &s;uppo&s;e we are to have no more from that quar|ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my dear,"</Q> &s;ays the Lady, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to Captain Roach, and as my poor eyes won't &s;uffer me to write my&s;elf, I have been for &s;ome time looking out for another.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I know,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Skeggs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by experience. For of the three com|panions I had this la&s;t half year, one of them refu&s;ed to do plain-work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a year too &s;mall a &s;a|lary, and I was obliged to &s;end away the third, becau&s;e I &s;u&s;pected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear La|dy Blarney, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"</Q></P>
<P>My wife had been for a long time all attention to this di&s;cour&s;e; but was particu|larly &s;truck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year made fifty-&s;ix pounds five &s;hillings Engli&s;h money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might ea&s;ily be &s;ecured in
<PB N="107" REF="110">
the family. She for a moment &s;tudied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion, that two &s;uch places would fit our two daughters ex|actly. Be&s;ides, if the 'Squire had any real affection for my elde&s;t daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife there|fore was re&s;olved that we &s;hould not be de|prived of &s;uch advantages for want of a&s;&s;u|rance, and undertook to harangue for the family. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your Lady|&s;hips will pardon my pre&s;ent pre&s;ump|tion. It is true, we have no right to pretend to &s;uch favours; but yet it is na|tural for me to wi&s;h putting my children forward in the world. And I will be bold to &s;ay my two girls have had a pret|ty good education, and capacity, at lea&s;t the country can't &s;hew better. They can read, write, and ca&s;t accompts; they un|der&s;tand their needle, bread&s;titch, cro&s;s and change, and all manner of plain-work; they can pink, point, and frill;
<PB N="108" REF="111">
and know &s;omething of mu&s;ic; they can do up &s;mall cloaths, work upon catgut; my elde&s;t can cut paper, and my younge&s;t has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards."</Q></P>
<P>When &s;he had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in &s;ilence, with an air of doubt and importance. At la&s;t, Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs conde&s;cended to ob&s;erve, that the young ladies, from the opinion &s;he could form of them from &s;o &s;light an acquaintance, &s;eem|ed very fit for &s;uch employments: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But a thing of this kind, Madam,"</Q> cried &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing my &s;pou&s;e, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"requires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not, Madam,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect the young ladies virtue, pru|dence and di&s;cretion; but there is a form in the&s;e things, Madam, there is a form."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112">
My wife approved her &s;u&s;picions very much, ob&s;erving, that &s;he was very apt to be &s;u&s;picious her&s;elf; but referred her to all the neighbours for a character: but this our Peere&s;s declined as unnece&s;&s;ary, alledg|ing that her cou&s;in Thornhill's recommen|dation would be &s;ufficient, and upon this we re&s;ted our petition.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we were returned home, the night was dedicated to &s;chemes of future conque&s;t. Deborah exerted much &s;agacity in conjecturing which of the two girls was likely to have the be&s;t place, and mo&s;t opportunities of &s;eeing good compa|ny. The only ob&s;tacle to our preferment was in obtaining the 'Squire's recommenda|tion; but he had already &s;hewn us too many in&s;tances of his friend&s;hip to doubt of it now. Even in bed my wife kept up the u&s;ual theme: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, faith, my dear Charles, between our&s;elves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of
<PB N="112" REF="114">
it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pretty well,"</Q> cried I, not knowing what to &s;ay.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What only pretty well?"</Q> returned &s;he. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think it is very well. Suppo&s;e the girls &s;hould come to make acquaintances of ta&s;te in town! And this I am a&s;&s;ured of, that London is the only place in the world for all man|ner of hu&s;bands. Be&s;ides, my dear, &s;tranger things happen every day: and as ladies of quality are &s;o taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality be! Entre nous, I prote&s;t I like my Lady Blarney va&s;tly, &s;o very obliging. However, Mi&s;s Carolina Wilelmina Ame|lia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you &s;aw at once how I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> re|turned I, not knowing well what to think of the matter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"heaven grant they may be both the better for it this day three months!"</Q> This was one of tho&s;e ob&s;er|vations I u&s;ually made to impre&s;s my wife with an opinion of my &s;agacity; for if the
<PB N="113" REF="115">
girls &s;ucceeded, then it was a pious wi&s;h fulfilled; but if any thing unfortunate en|&s;ued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this conver&s;ation, however, was only preparatory to another &s;cheme, and indeed I dreaded as much. This was nothing le&s;s than, that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper to &s;ell the Colt, which was grown old, at a neighbour|ing fair, and buy us an hor&s;e that would carry &s;ingle or double upon an occa&s;ion, and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a vi&s;it. This at fir&s;t I oppo&s;ed &s;tout|ly; but it was as &s;toutly defended. How|ever, as I weakened, my antagoni&s;t gained &s;trength, till at la&s;t it was re&s;olved to 'part with him.</P>
<P>As the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of going my&s;elf; but my wife per&s;uaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"our &s;on Mo&s;es is a di&s;creet boy,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
and can buy and &s;ell to very good ad|vantage; you know all our great bar|gains are of his purcha&s;ing. He always &s;tands out and higgles, and actually tires them till he gets a bargain."</Q></P>
<P>As I had &s;ome opinion of my &s;on's pru|dence, I was willing enough to entru&s;t him with this commi&s;&s;ion; and the next morning I perceived his &s;i&s;ters mighty bu&s;y in fitting out Mo&s;es for the fair; trimming his hair, bru&s;hing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the toilet be|ing over, we had at la&s;t the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him mounted upon the Colt, with a deal box before him to bring home gro|ceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightning, which, though grown too &s;hort, was much too good to be thrown away. His wai&s;tcoat was of go&s;ling green, and his &s;i&s;|ters had tied his hair with a broad black ribband. We all followed him &s;everal paces from the door, bawling after him
<PB N="115" REF="117">
good luck, good luck, till we could &s;ee him no longer.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce gone, when Mr. Thorn|hill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, &s;aying, that he over|heard his young ma&s;ter mention our names with great commendations.</P>
<P>Good fortune &s;eemed re&s;olved not to come alone. Another footman from the &s;ame family followed, with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received &s;uch a plea&s;ing account from Mr. Thornhill of us all, that, after a few previous enquiries more, they hoped to be perfectly &s;atisfied. <Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I now &s;ee it is no ea&s;y matter to get into the families of the great; but when one once gets in, then, as Mo&s;es &s;ays, they may go &s;leep."</Q> To this piece of humour, for &s;he intended it for wit, my daughters a&s;&s;ented with a loud laugh of plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, &s;uch was her &s;atisfaction at this me&s;|&s;age, that &s;he actually put her hand to her
<PB N="116" REF="118">
pocket, and gave the me&s;&s;enger &s;even-pence halfpenny.</P>
<P>This was to be our vi&s;iting-day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for them, and give them by letters at a time. He brought my daughters al&s;o a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, &s;nuff, patches, or even money, when they got it. My wife was u&s;ually fond of a wee&s;el &s;kin pur&s;e, as being the mo&s;t lucky; but this by the bye. We had &s;till a regard for Mr. Burchell, though his late rude be|haviour was in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;plea&s;ing; nor could we now avoid communicating our happine&s;s to him, and a&s;king his ad|vice: although we &s;eldom followed ad|vice, we were all ready enough to a&s;k it. When he read the note from the two ladies, he &s;hook his head, and ob&s;erved, that an af|fair of this &s;ort demanded the utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection.&mdash;This air of diffidence
<PB N="117" REF="119">

<P>OUR family had now made &s;everal at|tempts to be fine; but &s;ome unfore&s;een di&s;a&s;ter demoli&s;hed each as &s;oon as project|ed.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Once upon a time,"</Q> cried the child, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a Giant and a Dwarf were friends, and kept together. They made a bar|gain that they would never for&s;ake each other, but go &s;eek adventures. The fir&s;t battle they fought was with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very courageous, dealt one of the champions a mo&s;t angry blow. It did the Saracen but very little injury, who lifting up his &s;word, fairly &s;truck off the poor Dwarf's arm. He was now in a woeful plight; but the Giant coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a &s;hort time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of &s;pite. They then travelled on to another adventure. This was again&s;t three bloody-minded
<PB N="125" REF="126">
Satyrs, who were carrying away a dam|&s;el in di&s;tre&s;s. The Dwarf was not quite &s;o fierce now as before; but for all that, &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, which was returned by another, that knocked out his eye: but the Giant was &s;oon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very joyful for this victo|ry, and the dam&s;el who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The Giant, for the fir&s;t time, was foremo&s;t now; but the Dwarf was not far behind. The battle was &s;tout and long. Wherever the Giant came all fell before him; but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At la&s;t the victory declared for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf lo&s;t his leg. The Dwarf was now without an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant, who was without a &s;in|gle wound, cried out to him, Come

No, cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wi&s;er, no, I declare off; I'll fight no more: for I find in every battle that you get all the honour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me."</Q></P>
<P>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm di&s;|pute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughters intended expedition to town. My wife very &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon the advantages that would re&s;ult from it. Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, di&s;|&s;uaded her with great ardor, and I &s;tood neuter. His pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ua&s;ions &s;eemed but the &s;econd part of tho&s;e which were re|ceived with &s;o ill a grace in the morning. The di&s;pute grew high, while poor De|borah, in&s;tead of rea&s;oning &s;tronger, talked louder, and at la&s;t was obliged to take &s;helter from a defeat in clamour. The
<PB N="127" REF="128">
conclu&s;ion of her harangue, however, was highly di&s;plea&s;ing to us all: &s;he knew, &s;he &s;aid, of &s;ome who had their own &s;ecret rea&s;ons for what they advi&s;ed; but, for her part, &s;he wi&s;hed &s;uch to &s;tay away from her hou&s;e for the future.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> cried Burchell, with looks of great compo|&s;ure, which tended to enflame her the more, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as for &s;ecret rea&s;ons, you are right: I have &s;ecret rea&s;ons, which I forbear to mention, becau&s;e you are not able to an|&s;wer tho&s;e of which I make no &s;ecret: but I find my vi&s;its here are become trouble|&s;ome; I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once more to take a final farewell when I am quitting the coun|try."</Q> Thus &s;aying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, who&s;e looks &s;eemed to upbraid his preci|pitancy, prevent his going.</P>
<P>When gone, we all regarded each other for &s;ome minutes with confu&s;ion. My wife, who knew her&s;elf to be the cau&s;e, &s;trove to hide her concern with a forced &s;mile,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
and an air of a&s;&s;urance, which I was willing to reprove: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How, woman,"</Q> cried I to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is it thus we treat &s;trangers? Is it thus we return their kindne&s;s?

But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of &s;uch men, and that it would be even madne&s;s to expect happine&s;s from one who has been &s;o very bad an oeconomi&s;t of his own. Your mother and I have now better pro&s;pects for you. The next winter, which you will probably &s;pend in town, will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</Q></P>
<P>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occa&s;ion, I can't pretend to determine; but I was not di&s;plea&s;ed at the bottom that we were rid of a gue&s;t from whom I had much to fear. Our breach of ho&s;pitality went to my con&s;cience a little: but I quickly &s;ilenced that monitor by two or three &s;pecious rea&s;ons, which &s;erved to

<P>Fre&s;h mortifications, or a demon&s;tration that &s;eeming calamities may be real ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE journey of my daughters to town was now re&s;olved upon, Mr. Thorn|hill having kindly promi&s;ed to in&s;pect their conduct him&s;elf, and inform us by letter of their behaviour. But it was thought indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that their appearance &s;hould equal the greatne&s;s of their expec|tations, which could not be done without &s;ome expence. We debated therefore in full council what were the ea&s;ie&s;t methods of rai&s;ing money, or, more properly &s;peaking, what we could mo&s;t conve|niently &s;ell. The deliberation was &s;oon fini&s;hed, it was found that our remaining
<PB N="132" REF="133">
hor&s;e was utterly u&s;ele&s;s for the plow, with|out his companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye, it was there|fore determined that we &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of him for the purpo&s;es above-mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and, to prevent im|po&s;ition, that I &s;hould go with him my&s;elf. Though this was one of the fir&s;t mercan|tile tran&s;actions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting my&s;elf with reputa|tion. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is mea&s;ured by that of the company he keeps, and as mine was mo&s;t|ly in the family way, I had conceived no unfavourable &s;entiments of my worldly wi&s;|dom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had got &s;ome paces from the door, called me back, to advi&s;e me, in a whi&s;per, to have all my eyes about me.</P>
<P>I had, in the u&s;ual forms, when I came to the fair, put my hor&s;e through all his paces; but for &s;ome time had no bidders. At la&s;t a
<PB N="133" REF="134">
chapman approached, and, after he had for a good while examined the hor&s;e round, finding him blind of one eye, would have nothing to &s;ay to him: a &s;econd came up; but ob&s;erving he had a &s;pavin, de|clared he would not take him for the driv|ing home: a third perceived he had a windgall, and would bid no money: a fourth knew by his eye that he had the botts: a fifth, more impertinent than all the re&s;t, wondered what a plague I could do to the fair with a blind, &s;pavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time I began to have a mo&s;t hearty contempt for the poor animal my&s;elf, and was almo&s;t a&s;hamed at the approach of every new cu&s;tomer; for though I did not entirely believe all the fellows told me; yet I reflected that the number of witne&s;&s;es was a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion they were right, and St. Gregory, up|on good works, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135">
I was in this mortifying &s;ituation, when a brother clergyman, an old acquain|tance, who had al&s;o bu&s;ine&s;s to the fair, came up, and &s;haking me by the hand, propo&s;ed adjourning to a public-hou&s;e and taking a gla&s;s of whatever we could get. I readily clo&s;ed with the offer, and entering an ale-hou&s;e, we were &s;hewn into a little back room, where there was only a venera|ble old man, who &s;at wholly intent over a large book, which he was reading. I ne|ver in my life &s;aw a figure that pre|po&s;&s;ed me more favourably. His locks of &s;ilver grey venerably &s;haded his temples, and his green old age &s;eemed to be the re&s;ult of health and benevolence. However, his pre|&s;ence did not interrupt our conver&s;ation; my friend and I di&s;cour&s;ed on the various turns of fortune we had met: the Whi&s;tonean con|trover&s;y, my la&s;t pamphlet, the archdea|con's reply, and the hard mea&s;ure that was dealt me. But our attention was in a &s;hort time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, re&s;pectfully &s;aid &s;ome|thing
<PB N="135" REF="136">
&s;oftly to the old &s;tranger. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Make no apoligies, my child,"</Q> &s;aid the old man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures: take this, I wi&s;h it were more; but five pounds will relieve your di&s;tre&s;s, and you are welcome."</Q> The mode&s;t youth &s;hed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was &s;carce equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevolence plea&s;ed me &s;o. He conti|nued to read, and we re&s;umed our conver|&s;ation, until my companion, after &s;ome time, recollecting that he had bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act in the fair, promi&s;ed to be &s;oon back; adding, that he always de&s;ired to have as much of Dr. Primro&s;e's company as po&s;&s;ible. The old gentleman, hearing my name mentioned, &s;eemed to look at me with attention, and when my friend was gone, mo&s;t re&s;pectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primro&s;e, that couragious monogami&s;t, who had been the bulwark of the church.

I was re&s;olved therefore to bring him to the touch-&s;tone; but he was too mild and too gentle to contend for vic|tory.

nothing; by which I under&s;tood he could &s;ay much, if he thought proper. The &s;ub|ject therefore in&s;en&s;ibly changed from the bu&s;ine&s;s of antiquity to that which brought us both to the fair; mine I told him was to &s;ell an hor&s;e, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My hor&s;e was &s;oon produced, and in fine we &s;truck a bargain. Nothing now remained but to pay me, and he accordingly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand, he ordered the landlady to call up his footman, who made his appearance in a very genteel livery. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, Abra|ham,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbour Jack&s;on's, or any where."</Q> While the fellow was gone, he entertained me with a pathetic harangue on the great &s;carcity of &s;ilver, which I undertook to improve, by deplor|ing al&s;o the great &s;carcity of gold; and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never &s;o hard

to be come at as now. Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change, tho' he had offered half a crown for doing it. This was a very great di&s;appointment to us all; but the old gentleman having pau&s;ed a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country: upon replying that he was my next door neighbour, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be the ca&s;e then,"</Q> re|turned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe we &s;hall deal.

<P>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way di&s;po&s;ed for battle. My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them, that their journey to town was entirely over. The two ladies having heard reports of us from &s;ome malicious per&s;on about us, were that day &s;et out for London. He could

neither di&s;cover the tendency, nor the au|thor of the&s;e. but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to a&s;&s;ure our family of his friend&s;hip and protection.

But what per|plexed us mo&s;t was to think who could be &s;o ba&s;e as to a&s;per&s;e the character of a fa|mily &s;o harmle&s;s as ours, too humble to ex|cite envy, and too inoffen&s;ive to create di&s;|gu&s;t.</P>

<P>All Mr. Burchell's villainy at once detected. The folly of being over-wi&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT evening and a part of the fol|lowing day was employed in fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover our enemies: &s;carce a family in the neighbourhood but incurred our &s;u&s;picions, and each of us had rea&s;ons for our opinion be&s;t known to our&s;elves. As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter-ca&s;e, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to be|long to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been &s;een, and, upon examination, con|tained &s;ome hints upon different &s;ubjects; but what particularly engaged our attention was a &s;ealed note, &s;uper&s;cribed, <HI>the copy of</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="146">
<HI>a letter to be &s;ent to the two ladies at Thornhill-ca&s;tle.</HI> It in&s;tantly occurred that he was the ba&s;e informer, and we delibe|rated whether the note &s;hould not be broke open. I was again&s;t it; but Sophia, who &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure that of all men he would be the la&s;t to be guilty of &s;o much ba&s;e|ne&s;s, in&s;i&s;ted upon its being read. In this &s;he was &s;econded by the re&s;t of the family, and, at their joint &s;olicitation, I read as follows:<Q REND="inline"><P>LADIES,</P>
<P>"THE bearer will &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy you as to the per&s;on from whom this comes: one at lea&s;t the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being &s;educed. I am informed for a truth, that you have &s;ome intentions of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have &s;ome knowledge of, under the character of companions. As I would neither have &s;implicity impo&s;ed up|on, nor virtue contaminated, I mu&s;t offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of &s;uch
<PB N="147" REF="147">
a &s;tep will be attended with dangerous con|&s;equences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with &s;everi|ty; nor &s;hould I now have taken this me|thod of explaining my&s;elf, or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take there|fore the admonition of a friend, and &s;eri|ou&s;ly reflect on the con&s;equences of intro|ducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto re&s;ided."</P></Q></P>
<P>Our doubts were now at an end. There &s;eemed indeed &s;omething applicable to both &s;ides in this letter, and its cen&s;ures might as well be referred to tho&s;e to whom it was written, as to us; but the malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had &s;carce patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the wri|ter with unre&s;trained re&s;entment. Olivia was equally &s;evere, and Sophia &s;eemed per|fectly amazed at his ba&s;ene&s;s. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vile&s;t in&s;tances of unprovoked ingratitude I had
<PB N="148" REF="148">
met with. Nor could I account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his de&s;ire of detaining my younge&s;t daugh|ter in the country, to have the more fre|quent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all &s;ate ruminating upon &s;chemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came runing in to tell us that Mr. Bur|chell was approaching at the other end of the field. It is ea&s;ier to conceive than de|&s;cribe the complicated &s;en&s;ations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury, and the plea&s;ure of approaching revenge. Tho' our intentions were only to upbraid him with his ingratitude; yet it was re&s;olved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting. For this purpo&s;e we agreed to meet him with our u&s;ual &s;miles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindne&s;s, to amu&s;e him a little; but then in the mid&s;t of the flattering calm to bur&s;t upon him like an earthquake, and over|whelm him with the &s;en&s;e of his own ba&s;e|ne&s;s. This being re&s;olved upon, my wife undertook to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s her&s;elf,
<PB N="149" REF="149">
as &s;he really had &s;ome talents for &s;uch an un|dertaking. We &s;aw him approach, he enter|ed, drew a chair, and &s;ate down.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A fine day, Mr. Burchell."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A very fine day, Doctor; though I fancy we &s;hall have &s;ome rain by the &s;hooting of my corns."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;hooting of your horns,"</Q> cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then a&s;ked pardon for being fond of a joke.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear madam,"</Q> re|plied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I pardon you with all my heart; for I prote&s;t I &s;hould not have thought it a joke till you told me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps not, Sir,"</Q> cried my wife, winking at us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet I dare &s;ay you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, madam,"</Q> returned Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have been reading a je&s;t book this morning, that ounce of jokes is &s;o very good a con|ceit; and yet, madam, I had rather &s;ee half an ounce of under&s;tanding."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe you might,"</Q> cried my wife, &s;till &s;miling at us, though the laugh was again&s;t her; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet I have &s;een &s;ome men pretend to under&s;tanding that have

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I always held that favourite maxim of Pope,"</Q> returned Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as very unworthy a man of genius, and a ba&s;e de&s;ertion of his own &s;uperiority.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your pre&s;ent ob&s;er|vation is ju&s;t, when there are &s;hining vir|tues and minute defects; but when it ap|pears that great vices are oppo&s;ed in the &s;ame mind to as extraordinary virtues, &s;uch a character de&s;erves contempt.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;ound well,"</Q> re|turned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet it would be ea&s;y this moment to point out a man,"</Q> and I fixed my eye &s;tedfa&s;tly upon him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who&s;e head and heart form a mo&s;t dete&s;table contra&s;t.

So &s;aying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a &s;mile, and &s;hutting the cla&s;ps with the utmo&s;t compo|&s;ure, left us, quite a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;erenity of his a&s;&s;urance.

Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake fate, that went before in the &s;hape of an executioner: but &s;hame be|ing naturally timorous, returned back to keep company with virtue, which, in the beginning of their journey, they had left behind.

<P>The family u&s;e art, which is oppo&s;ed with &s;till greater.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's &s;en&s;ations, the re&s;t of the family was ea&s;ily con&s;oled for Mr. Bur|chell's ab&s;ence by the company of our landlord, who&s;e vi&s;its now became more fre|quent and longer. Though he had been di&s;appointed in procuring my daughters the amu&s;ements of the town, as he de&s;igned, he took every opportunity of &s;upplying them with tho&s;e little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He u&s;ually came in the morning, and while my &s;on and I followed our occupations abroad, he &s;at with the family at home, and amu&s;ed them by de&s;cribing the town, with every part
<PB N="158" REF="157">
of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the ob&s;ervations that were retailed in the atmo&s;phere of the play-hou&s;es, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote long before they made way into the je&s;t-books. The intervals be|tween cover&s;ation were employed in teach|ing my daughters piquet, or &s;ometimes in &s;etting my two little ones to box to make them <HI>&s;harp,</HI> as he called it: but the hopes of having him for a &s;on-in-law, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure blinded us to all his defects. It mu&s;t be owned that my wife laid a thou&s;and &s;chemes to entrap him, or, to &s;peak it more tenderly, u&s;ed every art to magnify the me|rit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea eat &s;hort and cri&s;p, they were made by Oli|via: if the goo&s;eberry wine was well knit, the goo&s;eberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers gave the pickles their pecu|liar green; and in the compo&s;ition of a pudding, her judgment was infallible. Then the poor woman would &s;ometimes tell the 'Squire, that &s;he thought him and Oli|via
<PB N="159" REF="158">
extremely like each other, and would bid both &s;tand up to &s;ee which was talle&s;t. The&s;e in&s;tances of cunning, which &s;he thought impenetrable, yet which every bo|dy &s;aw through, were very plea&s;ing to our benefactor, who gave every day &s;ome new proofs of his pa&s;&s;ion, which though they had not ari&s;en to propo&s;als of marriage, yet we thought fell but little &s;hort of it; and his &s;lowne&s;s was attributed &s;ometimes to native ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and &s;ometimes to his fear of of|fending a rich uncle. An occurrence, how|ever, which happened &s;oon after, put it beyond a doubt that he de&s;igned to become one of the family, my wife even regarded it as an ab&s;olute promi&s;e.</P>
<P>My wife and daughters happening to re|turn a vi&s;it to neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pic|tures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and did them for fifteen &s;hillings a head. As this family and ours had long a &s;ort of rivalry in point of ta&s;te, our &s;pirit took the alarm at this &s;tolen march upon us,
<PB N="160" REF="159">
and notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay, and I &s;aid much, it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner, for what could I do? our next deliberation was to &s;hew the &s;uperiority of our ta&s;te in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's fa|mily, there were &s;even of them, and they were drawn with &s;even oranges, a thing quite out of ta&s;te, no variety in life, no compo&s;ition in the world. We de&s;ired to have &s;omething done in a brighter &s;tyle, and, after many debates, at length came to an unanimous re&s;olution to be drawn to|gether, in one large hi&s;torical family piece. This would be cheaper, &s;ince one frame would &s;erve for all, and it would be infi|nitely more genteel; for all families of any ta&s;te were now drawn in the &s;ame manner. As we did not immediately recollect an hi&s;|torical &s;ubject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independent hi&s;torical figures. My wife de&s;ired to be repre&s;ented as Venus, with a &s;tomacher richly &s;et with diamonds, and her two lit|tle
<PB N="161" REF="160">
ones as Cupids by her &s;ide, while I, in my gown and band, was to pre&s;ent her with my books on the Bangorean contro|ver&s;y. Olivia would be drawn as an Ama|zon, &s;itting upon a bank of flowers, dre&s;t in a green jo&s;eph, laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a &s;hepherde&s;s, with as many &s;heep as the pain|ter could &s;pare; and Mo&s;es was to be dre&s;t out with an hat and white feather. Our ta&s;te &s;o much plea&s;ed the 'Squire, that he in&s;i&s;ted on being put in as one of the family in the character of Alexander the great, at Olivia's feet. This was con&s;idered by us all as an indication of his de&s;ire to be in|troduced into the family in reality, nor could we refu&s;e his reque&s;t. The painter was therefore &s;et to work, and as he wrought with a&s;&s;iduity and expedition, in le&s;s than four days the whole was compleated. The piece was large, and it mu&s;t be owned he did not &s;pare his colours; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly &s;atisfied with his performance;
<PB N="162" REF="161">
but an unfortunate circum&s;tance had not occurred till the picture was fini&s;hed, which now &s;truck us with di&s;may. It was &s;o very large that we had no place in the hou&s;e to fix it. How we all came to di&s;regard &s;o material a point is inconceivable; but cer|tain it is, we were this time all greatly over|&s;een. In&s;tead therefore of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, there it leaned, in a mo&s;t mortifying manner, again&s;t the kitchen wall, where the canvas was &s;tretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the je&s;t of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe's long-boat, too large to be remov|ed; another thought it more re&s;embled a reel in a bottle; &s;ome wondered how it &s;hould be got out, and &s;till more were amazed how it ever got in.</P>
<P>But though it excited the ridicule of &s;ome, it effectually rai&s;ed more ill-natured &s;ugge&s;|tions in many. The 'Squire's portrait be|ing found united with ours, was an honour too great to e&s;cape envy. Malicious whi&s;|pers
<PB N="163" REF="162">
began to circulate at our expence, and our tranquility continually to be di&s;turbed by per&s;ons who came as friends to tell us what was &s;aid of us by enemies. The&s;e reports we always re&s;ented with becoming &s;pirit; but &s;candal ever improves by oppo|&s;ition. We again therefore entered into a con&s;ultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies, and at la&s;t came to a re&s;olu|tion which had too much cunning to give me entire &s;atisfaction. It was this: as our prin|cipal object was to di&s;cover the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addre&s;&s;es, my wife under|took to &s;ound him, by pretending to a&s;k his advice in the choice of an hu&s;band for her elde&s;t daughter. If this was not found &s;uf|ficient to induce him to a declaration, it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival, which it was thought would compel him, though never &s;o refractory. To this la&s;t &s;tep, however, I would by no means give my con&s;ent, till Olivia gave me the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances that &s;he would marry the per&s;on provided to rival him upon this occa&s;ion, if Mr. Thornhill did not prevent it,
<PB N="164" REF="163">
by taking her him&s;elf. Such was the &s;cheme laid, which though I did not &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e, I did not entirely approve.</P>
<P>The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to &s;ee us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her &s;cheme in execution; but they only re|tired to the next room, from whence they could over-hear the whole conver&s;ation; which my wife artfully introduced, by ob|&s;erving, that one of the Mi&s;s Flamboroughs was like to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'Squire a&s;&s;ent|ing, &s;he proceeded to remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always &s;ure of getting good hu&s;bands: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But heaven help,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the girls that have none. What &s;ignifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what &s;ignifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of &s;elf-intere&s;t? It is not, what is &s;he? but what has &s;he? is all the cry."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I highly ap|prove the ju&s;tice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir!"</Q> returned my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are plea&s;ed to be facetious: but I wi&s;h I were a queen, and then I know where they &s;hould look for an hu&s;band.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Scarce any virtue found to re&s;i&s;t the power of long and plea&s;ing temptation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I only &s;tudied my child's real hap|pine&s;s, the a&s;&s;iduity of Mr. Williams plea&s;ed me, as he was in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, prudent, and &s;incere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o that in an evening or two after he and Mr. Thornhill met at our hou&s;e, and &s;urveyed each other for &s;ome time with looks of anger: but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little re|garded his indignation. Olivia, on her &s;ide, acted the coquet to perfection, if that might be called acting which was her real character, pretending to lavi&s;h all her ten|derne&s;s on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill
<PB N="170" REF="168">
appeared quite dejected at this prefe|rence, and with a pen&s;ive air took leave, though I own it puzzled me to find him &s;o much in pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power &s;o ea&s;ily to remove the cau&s;e, by declaring an honourable pa&s;|&s;ion. But whatever unea&s;ine&s;s he &s;eemed to endure, it could ea&s;ily be perceived that Olivia's angui&s;h was &s;till greater. After any of the&s;e interviews between her lovers, of which there were &s;everal, &s;he u&s;ually re|tired to &s;olitude, and there indulged her grief. It was in &s;uch a &s;ituation I found her one evening, after &s;he had been for &s;ome time &s;upporting a fictitious gayety.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You now &s;ee, my child,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your confidence in Mr. Thornhill's pa&s;|&s;ion was all a dream: he permits the ri|valry of another, every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to &s;ecure you by a candid declaration him|&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, pappa,"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but he has his rea&s;ons for this delay: I know he has. The &s;incerity of his looks and words convince me of his real e&s;teem.
<PB N="171" REF="169">
A &s;hort time, I hope, will di&s;cover the ge|nero&s;ity of his &s;entiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more ju&s;t than yours."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Olivia, my dar|ling,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every &s;cheme that has been hitherto pur&s;ued to compel him to a declaration, has been propo&s;ed and plan|ned by your&s;elf, nor can you in the lea&s;t &s;ay that I have con&s;trained you. But you mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, that I will be ever in&s;trumental in &s;uffering his ho|ne&s;t rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed pa&s;&s;ion. Whatever time you re|quire to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation &s;hall be granted; but at the expiration of that term, if he is &s;till regardle&s;s, I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t that hone&s;t Mr. Williams &s;hall be rewarded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto &s;upported in life demands this from me, and my tenderne&s;s, as a parent, &s;hall never influence my in|tegrity as a man. Name then your day, let it be as di&s;tant as you think proper, and in the mean time take care to let
<PB N="172" REF="170">
Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I de&s;ign delivering you up to an|other. If he really loves you, his own good &s;en&s;e will readily &s;ugge&s;t that there is but one method alone to prevent his lo&s;ing you for ever."</Q>&mdash;This propo|&s;al, which &s;he could not avoid con&s;idering as perfectly ju&s;t, was readily agreed to. She again renewed her mo&s;t po&s;itive promi&s;e of marrying Mr. Williams, in ca&s;e of the other's in&s;en&s;ibility; and at the next oppor|tunity, in Mr. Thornhill's pre&s;ence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival.</P>
<P>Such vigorous proceedings &s;eemed to re|double Mr. Thornhill's anxiety: but what Olivia really felt gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. In this &s;truggle between prudence and pa&s;&s;ion, her vivacity quite for&s;ook her, and every op|portunity of &s;olitude was &s;ought, and &s;pent in tears. One week pa&s;&s;ed away; but her lover made no efforts to re&s;train her nuptials. The &s;ucceeding week he was &s;till a&s;&s;iduous; but not more open. On the
<PB N="173" REF="171">
third he di&s;continued his vi&s;its entirely, and in&s;tead of my daughter te&s;tifying any im|patience, as I expected, &s;he &s;eemed to re|tain a pen&s;ive tranquillity, which I looked upon as re&s;ignation. For my own part, I was now &s;incerely plea&s;ed with thinking that my child was going to be &s;ecured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently applauded her re&s;olution, It was within about four days of her in|tended nuptials, that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling &s;tories of the pa&s;t, and laying &s;chemes for the future.

<P>The pur&s;uit of a father to reclaim a lo&s;t child to virtue.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THO' the child could not de&s;cribe the gentleman's per&s;on who handed his &s;i&s;|ter into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, yet my &s;u&s;picions fell entirely upon our young landlord, who&s;e cha|racter for &s;uch intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my &s;teps towards Thornhill-ca&s;tle, re&s;olving to upbraid him, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring back my daughter: but before I had reached his &s;eat, I was met by one of my pari&s;hioners, who &s;aid he &s;aw a young lady re&s;embling my daughter in a po&s;t-chai&s;e with a gentleman, whom, by the de&s;cription, I could only gue&s;s to be Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very fa&s;t. This information, however, did by no
<PB N="188" REF="185">
means &s;atisfy me. I therefore went to the young 'Squire's, and though it was yet ear|ly, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing him immediately: he &s;oon appeared with the mo&s;t open fami|liar air, and &s;eemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, prote&s;ting upon his honour that he was quite a &s;tranger to it. I now therefore condemned my former &s;u&s;picions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who I recollected had of late &s;everal private conferences with her: but the appearance of another witne&s;s left me no room to doubt of his villainy, who averred, that he and my daughter were ac|tually gone towards the wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company. Hearing this, I re&s;olved to pur|&s;ue them there. I walked along with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, and enquired of &s;everal by the way; but received no accounts, till enter|ing the town, I was met by a per&s;on on hor&s;eback, whom I remembered to have &s;een at the 'Squire's, and he a&s;&s;ured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might de|pend
<PB N="189" REF="186">
upon overtaking them; for he had &s;een them dance there the night before, and the whole a&s;&s;embly &s;eemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon I came upon the cour&s;e. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all earne&s;tly employed in one pur&s;uit, that of plea|&s;ure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a lo&s;t child to virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at &s;ome di&s;tance from me; but, as if he dreaded an inter|view, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I &s;aw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no pur|po&s;e to continue my pur&s;uit farther, and re&s;olved to return home to an innocent fa|mily, who wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fever, the &s;ymptoms of which I perceived before I came off the cour&s;e. This was another un|expected &s;troke, as I was more than &s;eventy miles di&s;tant from home: however, I re|tired
<PB N="190" REF="187">
to a little ale-hou&s;e by the road-&s;ide, and in this place, the u&s;ual retreat of indi|gence and frugality, I laid me down pati|ently to wait the i&s;&s;ue of my di&s;order. I langui&s;hed here for near three weeks; but at la&s;t my con&s;titution prevailed, though I was unprovided with money to defray the expences of my entertainment. It is po&s;&s;i|ble the anxiety from this la&s;t circum&s;tance alone might have brought on a relap&s;e, had I not been &s;upplied by a traveller, who &s;topt to take a cur&s;ory refre&s;hment. This per|&s;on was no other than the philanthropic book&s;eller in St. Paul's church-yard, who has written &s;o many little books for children: he called him&s;elf their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no &s;ooner alighted, but he was in ha&s;te to be gone; for he was ever on bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the hi&s;tory of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face; for he had pub|li&s;hed for me again&s;t the Deuterogami&s;ts of
<PB N="191" REF="188">
the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I re&s;olved to return home by ea&s;y journies of ten miles a day. My health and u&s;ual tranquillity were almo&s;t re&s;tored, and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of correction. Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them; as in a&s;cending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every &s;tep we ri&s;e &s;hews us &s;ome new pro&s;pect of hidden di&s;|appointment; &s;o in our de&s;cent to the vale of wretchedne&s;s, which, from the &s;ummits of plea&s;ure appears dark and gloomy, the bu&s;y mind, &s;till attentive to its own amu&s;e|ment, finds &s;omething to flatter and &s;ur|pri&s;e it. Still as we de&s;cend, the objects appear to brighten, unexpected pro&s;pects amu&s;e, and the mental eye becomes adapt|ed to its gloomy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I now proceeded forwards, and had walked about two hours, when I perceived
<PB N="192" REF="189">
what appeared at a di&s;tance like the wag|gon, which I was re&s;olved to overtake; but when I came up with it, found it to be a &s;trolling company's cart, that was carrying their &s;cenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the per&s;on who drove it, and one of the company, as the re&s;t of the players were to follow the en&s;uing day. Good company upon the road, &s;ays the proverb, is always the &s;horte&s;t cut, I therefore entered into conver&s;ation with the poor player; and as I once had &s;ome theatrical powers my&s;elf, I di&s;&s;erted on &s;uch topics with my u&s;ual freedom: but as I was pretty much unacquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;tage, I demanded who were the pre&s;ent theatrical writers in vogue, who the Drydens and Otways of the day.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Sir,"</Q> cried the player, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"few of our modern dramati&s;ts would think them|&s;elves much honoured by being com|pared to the writers you mention.

<P>By this time the equipage of the &s;trolling company was arrived at the village, which, it &s;eems, had been appri&s;ed of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us; for my compa|nion ob&s;erved, that &s;trollers always have more &s;pectators without doors than within. I did not con&s;ider the impropriety of my being in &s;uch company till I &s;aw a mob ga|thered about me. I therefore took &s;hel|ter, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, in the fir&s;t ale-hou&s;e that offered, and being &s;hewn into the common room, was acco&s;ted by a very well-dre&s;t gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my ma&s;querade character in the play. Upon informing him
<PB N="195" REF="192">
of the truth, and that I did not belong to the company, he was conde&s;cending e|nough to de&s;ire me and the player to par|take in a bowl of punch, over which he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed modern politics with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s and &s;eeming intere&s;t. I &s;et him down in my own mind for nothing le&s;s than a par|liament-man at lea&s;t; but was almo&s;t confirm|ed in my conjectures, when upon my a&s;king what there was in the hou&s;e for &s;upper, he in&s;i&s;ted that the player and I &s;hould &s;up with him at his hou&s;e, with which reque&s;t, after &s;ome entreaties, I was prevailed on to comply.</P>

<P>The de&s;cription of a per&s;on di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent government, and ap|prehen&s;ive of the lo&s;s of our liberties.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE hou&s;e where we were to be enter|tained, lying at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the village, our inviter ob&s;erved, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we &s;oon arrived at one of the mo&s;t magnificent man&s;ions I had &s;een in the country. The apartment into which we were &s;hewn was perfectly elegant and mo|dern; he went to give orders for &s;up|per, while the player, with a wink, ob|&s;erved that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer &s;oon returned, an elegant &s;upper was brought in, two or three ladies, in an

ea&s;y de&s;habille, were introduced, and the con|ver&s;ation began with &s;ome &s;prightline&s;s. Po|litics, however, was the &s;ubject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiated; for he a&s;&s;erted that liberty was at once his boa&s;t and his terror. After the cloth was remov|ed, he a&s;ked me if I had &s;een the la&s;t Mo|nitor, to which replying in the negative, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, nor the Auditor, I &s;uppo&s;e?"</Q> cried he. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Neither, Sir,"</Q> returned I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That's &s;trange, very &s;trange,"</Q> replied my entertainer. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, I read all the politics that come out. The Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the &s;eventeen magazines, and the two re|views; and though they hate each other, I love them all.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wi&s;h,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that &s;uch intrud|ing advi&s;ers were fixed in the pillory.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am for liberty, that attribute of Gods! Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king my&s;elf. We have all naturally an equal right to the throne: we are all originally equal. This is my opinion, and was once the opinion of a &s;et of hone&s;t men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect them&s;elves into a com|munity, where all &s;hould be equally free. But, alas! it would never an&s;wer; for there were &s;ome among them &s;tronger, and &s;ome more cunning than others, and the&s;e became ma&s;ters of the re&s;t; for as
<PB N="201" REF="197">
&s;ure as your groom rides your hor&s;es, be|cau&s;e he is a cunninger animal than they, &s;o &s;urely will the animal that is cunninger or &s;tronger than he, &s;it upon his &s;houl|ders in turn. Since then it is entailed upon humanity to &s;ubmit, and &s;ome are born to command, and others to obey, the que&s;tion is, as there mu&s;t be ty|rants, whether it is better to have them in the &s;ame hou&s;e with us, or in the &s;ame village, or &s;till farther off, in the metropolis. Now, Sir, for my own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better plea&s;ed am I. The generality of mankind al&s;o are of my way of thinking, and have unanimou&s;ly created one king, who&s;e election at once dimini&s;hes the number of tyrants, and puts tyranny at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the greate&s;t number of people. Now tho&s;e who were tyrants them&s;elves before the elec|tion of one tyrant, are naturally aver&s;e to a power rai&s;ed over them, and who&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="198">
weight mu&s;t ever lean heavie&s;t on the &s;u|bordinate orders. It is the intere&s;t of the great, therefore, to dimini&s;h kingly power as much as po&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e whatever they take from it is naturally re&s;tored to them|&s;elves; and all they have to do in a &s;tate, is to undermine the &s;ingle tyrant, by which they re&s;ume their primaeval authority. Now, a &s;tate may be &s;o con&s;titutionally cir|cum&s;tanced, its laws may be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, and its men of opulence &s;o minded, as all to con&s;pire to carry on this bu&s;ine&s;s of undermining monarchy. If the circum|&s;tances of the &s;tate be &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as to favour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent &s;till more rich, this will encrea&s;e their &s;trength and their am|bition. But an accumulation of wealth mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the con&s;equence in a &s;tate when more riches flow in from ex|ternal commerce, than ari&s;e from inter|nal indu&s;try: for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have al&s;o at the &s;ame
<PB N="203" REF="199">
time all the emoluments ari&s;ing from in|ternal indu&s;try: &s;o that the rich, in &s;uch a &s;tate, have two &s;ources of wealth, where|as the poor have but one. Thus wealth in all commercial &s;tates is found to accu|mulate, and &s;uch have hitherto in time become ari&s;tocratical. Be&s;ides this, the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth; as when tho&s;e natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is or|dained that the rich &s;hall only marry a|mong each other; or when the learned are held unqualified to &s;erve their coun|try as coun&s;ellors merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wi&s;e man's ambition; by the&s;e means I &s;ay, and &s;uch means as the&s;e, riches will accumulate. The po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of accumulated wealth, when fur|ni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;aries and plea&s;ures of life, can employ the &s;uperfluity of for|tune only in purcha&s;ing power. That is, differently &s;peaking, in making de|pendants,
<PB N="204" REF="200">
in purcha&s;ing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous ty|ranny for bread. Thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poore&s;t of the people; and the po|lity abounding in accumulated wealth, may be compared to a Carte&s;ian &s;y&s;tem, each orb with a vortex of its own. Tho&s;e, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex, are only &s;uch as mu&s;t be &s;laves, the rabble of mankind, who&s;e &s;ouls and who&s;e education are adapted to &s;ervitude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there mu&s;t &s;till be a large number of the people without the &s;phere of the opulent man's influence, namely, that order of men which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the very rich and the very rabble; tho&s;e men who are po&s;|&s;e&s;t of too large fortunes to &s;ubmit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to &s;et up for tyranny them&s;elves. In this middle order of mankind are ge|nerally
<PB N="205" REF="201">
to be found all the arts, wi&s;dom, and virtues of &s;ociety. This order alone is known to be the true pre&s;erver of freedom, and may be called the People. Now it may happen that this middle or|der of mankind may lo&s;e all its influence in a &s;tate, and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble: for if the fortune &s;ufficient for qualifying a per|&s;on at pre&s;ent to give his voice in &s;tate affairs, be ten times le&s;s than was judged &s;ufficient upon forming the con&s;titution, it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political &s;y&s;tem, and they ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where greatne&s;s &s;hall direct. In &s;uch a &s;tate, therefore, all that the middle order has left, is to pre&s;erve the prerogative and privileges of the one principal tyrant with the mo&s;t &s;acred circum&s;pection. For he divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the midle order placed beneath them. The middle order may be com|pared
<PB N="206" REF="202">
to a town of which the opulent are forming the &s;iege, and which the tyrant is ha&s;tening to relieve. While the be|&s;iegers are in dread of the external ene|my, it is but natural to offer the town&s;|men the mo&s;t &s;pecious terms; to flatter them with &s;ounds, and amu&s;e them with privileges: but if they once defeat the tyrant, the walls of the town will be but a &s;mall defence to its inhabitants. What they may then expect, may be &s;een by turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for, monarchy, &s;a|cred monarchy; for if there be any thing &s;acred among&s;t men, it mu&s;t be the anointed &s;overeign of his people, and every diminution of his power in war, or in peace, is an infringemet upon the real liberties of the &s;ubject. The &s;ounds of liberty, patrioti&s;m, and Britons, have al|ready done <HI>much,</HI> it is to be hoped that the true &s;ons of freedom will prevent their ever doing more. I have known
<PB N="207" REF="203">
many of tho&s;e bold champions for liber|ty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</Q></P>
<P>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue beyond the rules of good breeding: but the impatience of my en|tertainer, who often &s;trove to interrupt it, could be re&s;trained no longer. <Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then I have been all this while entertaining a Je&s;uit in par&s;on's cloaths; but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he &s;hall pack, if my name be Wil|kin&s;on."</Q> I now found I had gone too far, and a&s;ked pardon for the warmth with which I had &s;poken. <Q REND="inline">"Pardon,"</Q> returned he in a fury: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think &s;uch principles de|mand ten thou&s;and pardons.

But nothing could now exceed my confu&s;ion upon &s;eeing the gentleman, with his lady, enter, nor was their &s;urprize, at finding &s;uch company and good cheer, le&s;s than ours. <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen,"</Q> cried the real ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to me and my companion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am your mo&s;t hum|ble &s;ervant; but I prote&s;t this is &s;o unex|pected a favour, that I almo&s;t &s;ink under the obligation."</Q> However unexpected our company might be to him, his, I am &s;ure, was &s;till more &s;o to us, and I was &s;truck dumb with the apprehen&s;ions of my own ab&s;urdity, when whom &s;hould I next &s;ee enter the room but my dear mi&s;s Ara|bella

<P>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the hou&s;e belonged now, in&s;i&s;ted upon having the plea&s;ure of my &s;tay for &s;ome days, and as their niece, my charming pupil, who&s;e mind, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, had been formed

under my own in&s;tructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was &s;hewn to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning early Mi&s;s Wilmot de&s;ired to walk with me in the garden, which was deco|rated in the modern manner. After &s;ome time &s;pent in pointing out the beauties of the place, &s;he enquired with &s;eeming unconcern, when la&s;t I had heard from my &s;on George. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas!

My little family are now di&s;per&s;ing very fa&s;t, and poverty has brought not only want, but infamy upon us."</Q> The good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I &s;aw her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too much &s;en&s;ibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our &s;ufferings. It

was, however, &s;ome con&s;olation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affections, and that &s;he had rejected &s;everal matches that had been made her &s;ince our leaving her part of the country. She led me round all the exten&s;ive improvements of the place, pointing to the &s;everal walks and arbours, and at the &s;ame time catch|ing from every object a hint for &s;ome new que&s;tion relative to my &s;on. In this manner we &s;pent the forenoon, till the bell &s;ummoned us in to dinner, where we found the manager of the &s;trolling compa|ny, who was come to di&s;po&s;e of tickets for the Fair Penitent, which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a young gentleman who had never appeared on any &s;tage before. He &s;eemed to be very warm in the prai&s;es of the new performer, and averred, that he never &s;aw any who bid &s;o fair for excellence. Acting, he ob|&s;erved, was not learned in a day; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But this gentleman,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;eems born to tread the &s;tage. His voice, his

We caught him up accidentally in our jour|ney down."</Q> This account, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, excited our curio&s;ity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to ac|company them to the play-hou&s;e, which was no other than a barn. As the company with which I went was inconte&s;tably the chief of the place, we were received with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and placed in the front &s;eat of the theatre; where we &s;ate for &s;ome time with no &s;mall impatience to &s;ee Horatio make his appearance. The new performer advanced at la&s;t, and I found it was my unfortunate &s;on. He was go|ing to begin, when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived us, and &s;tood at once &s;peechle&s;s and immoveable. The actors behind the &s;cene, who a&s;cribed this pau&s;e to his natural timidity, attempted to encourage him; but in&s;tead of going on, he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and retired off the &s;tage. I don't know what were the &s;en&s;ations I felt; for they &s;ucceeded with
<PB N="213" REF="209">
too much rapidity for de&s;cription: but I was &s;oon awaked from this di&s;agreeable re|verie by Mi&s;s Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, de&s;ired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a &s;tranger to our extraordinary behaviour, being informed that the new performer was my &s;on, &s;ent his coach, and an invitation, for him; and as he per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al to appear again upon the &s;tage, the players put another in his place, and we &s;oon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kinde&s;t reception, and I received him with my u&s;ual tran&s;port; for I could never counterfeit fal&s;e re&s;entment. Mi&s;s Wilmot's reception was mixed with &s;eeming neglect, and yet I could perceive &s;he acted a &s;tudied part. The tumult in her mind &s;eemed not yet abated; &s;he &s;aid twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals &s;he would take a &s;ly peep at the gla&s;s, as
