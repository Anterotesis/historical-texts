<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT Friend&s;hip with which you have &s;o long honoured me, was never more clearly proved, or more nobly exerci&s;ed, than in the free and candid Account you lately gave me, of &s;ome Ex|ceptions
<PB N="2" REF="5">
taken again&s;t the E&s;timate, among certain Ranks of Men in Town, more par|ticularly on the Publication of the &s;econd Volume, and &s;ince the Author's Retire|ment into the Country.</P>
<P>THIS Intelligence hath indeed alarmed the Writer; and &s;et him to review his Work with greater Circum&s;pection even than that with which he writ it. 'Tis certain, that no Man can expect to hear the frank Opinions of the World, from the World it&s;elf. 'Tis, therefore, an Office of the true&s;t Friend&s;hip in your Lord&s;hip to com|municate all you have heard on this Sub|ject. The Objections which you have &s;o fairly &s;tated, I &s;hall an&s;wer in their Order; and with equal Plea&s;ure <HI>vindicate,</HI> where I think my&s;elf <HI>right</HI>; or <HI>retract,</HI> where I am <HI>wrong.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">ON this Occa&s;ion, your Lord&s;hip may expect a Series of Letters. This Method will equally alleviate <HI>my</HI> Trouble in <HI>writ|ing,</HI> and <HI>yours</HI> in <HI>reading.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to your Objec|tions, you will give me Leave, my Lord, briefly to &s;tate the main Intent or Scheme of the E&s;timate; in &s;uch a Manner as may prove a Sort of general Key to the Objections you have made. For I perceive plainly that many of them proceed from a mere Inattention to, or a total Mi&s;under|&s;tanding of the leading Principles of the Work.</P>
<P>AND that I may give your Lord&s;hip a ju&s;t Idea of its main De&s;ign, I will give you a &s;hort Account of the accidental <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of this Work; the leading Principles of which, are indeed no more
<PB N="4" REF="7">
than a &s;mall Part of a much larger De|&s;ign, of a much more exten&s;ive Nature.</P>
<P>THE Writer being convinced both from Books and Ob&s;ervation, that the Happine&s;s and Duration of States depends much le&s;s on mere Law and external In&s;titution, and much more on the internal Force of Man|ners and Principles than hath been com|monly imagined; and being of Opinion, that the fundamental and leading Cau&s;es of the Happine&s;s and Duration of States had not as yet been enquired into or pointed out, with that Particularity of Proof, Circum&s;tance and Illu&s;tration, which &s;o important a Subject might demand; had for &s;ome Time bent his Thoughts on a De&s;ign of con&s;iderable Extent, which might be called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Hi&s;tory and Analy&s;is of Manners and Principles in their &s;e|veral Periods."</Q>
His general Plan begins with the Examination of <HI>&s;avage Life,</HI> and
<PB N="5" REF="8">
proceeds through the &s;everal intermediate Periods of <HI>rude, &s;imple, civilized, poli&s;hed, effeminate, corrupt, profligate,</HI> to that of final DECLENSION and RUIN.</P>
<P>IN the Cour&s;e of this Plan (too exten|&s;ive, indeed, for the Mediocrity of the Writer's Talents) a Diver&s;ity of Circum|&s;tances, almo&s;t infinite, have pre&s;ented them&s;elves. The Ri&s;e, Changes, and Pro|gre&s;s of Commerce, Arts, Science, Reli|gion, Laws; their mutual Influence, and Effects on each other, and on Manners and Principles; the Characters, Virtues and Vices of Rank, Office, and Profe&s;&s;ion, in each of the Periods thus delineated; the natural Means by which the&s;e Periods ge|nerate each other; the Advantages and Di&s;advantages, Strengths and Weakne&s;&s;es, which mark and di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e &s;everal Periods; the mo&s;t practicable Means of
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<HI>bringing forward</HI> the <HI>&s;avage</HI> and <HI>rude</HI> Pe|riods towards <HI>poli&s;hed</HI> Life, and of <HI>bringing back</HI> the <HI>effeminate</HI> and <HI>corrupt</HI> Periods to the &s;ame <HI>&s;alutary Medium</HI>; above all, the Regulation and &s;trong E&s;tabli&s;hment of Manners and Principles to this important End;&mdash;the&s;e, with other &s;ubordinate Ar|ticles of Re&s;earch, proved and illu&s;trated by Facts drawn from Hi&s;tory, form the Sub&s;tance of the Writer's general De&s;ign.</P>
<P>ON this De&s;ign he was intent, when the War broke out between BRITAIN and FRANCE; which being very un&s;ucce&s;sful in its Beginnings, on the Part of BRITAIN; he thought he could not, in his private Sta|tion, do a better Service to his Country, than in pointing out what to him appeared the fundamental and <HI>latent Cau&s;es</HI> of this ill Succe&s;s. To this End he &s;ingled out &s;o much of his main De&s;ign, as immediately
<PB N="7" REF="10">
related to the pre&s;ent State of his own Times and Country; endeavouring to con|vince his Fellow Citizens, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Source of our public Mi&s;carriages did not lie merely in the particular and incidental Mi&s;conduct of Individuals; but in great Part in the prevailing Character of <HI>that Period in which we live</HI>; that is, in the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of the <HI>Times.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>HENCE alone, the E&s;timate had its ac|cidental Birth: Let it be chiefly remem|bered then, that the main Subject of this E&s;timate is &s;olely
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Effects of pre&s;ent Manners and Principles on the Duration of the State."</Q>
This the Writer in&s;i&s;ted on &s;o &s;trongly, and repeated &s;o often, that he thought his Readers would certainly carry it along with them: yet he finds, he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">THE leading Truths, therefore, which in the Cour&s;e of his Work he has attempted to prove, are the&s;e; That exorbitant Trade hath produced exorbitant Wealth; that this hath naturally produced a high De|gree of Luxury, and a general Attention to plea&s;urable Enjoyment <HI>among the higher Ranks,</HI> among whom the Effects of Lux|ury mu&s;t of cour&s;e <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appear. That the&s;e natural Effects of Wealth have been naturally attended with public Con&s;e|quences which tend to the weakening or Di&s;&s;olution of the State, by turning that general Attention upon <HI>plea&s;urable Enjoy|ment,</HI> which in &s;impler Times was bent on Views of <HI>Duty.</HI> That hence, a general Defect of Capacity, Fortitude, and Prin|ciple, did naturally ri&s;e; &s;uch as, in its End, mu&s;t be fatal, if unchecked in its Progre&s;s: and that all the leading Ranks were of cour&s;e infected with the&s;e natural
<PB N="9" REF="12">
Con&s;equences, in &s;ome Degree or other, from their very Situation.</P>
<P>THAT another Evil hath con&s;pired with this; and that as this aro&s;e from the Abu&s;e of Wealth, &s;o the other was inflamed by this, and aro&s;e from the Abu&s;e of Liberty. That our Con&s;titution, excellent in its Na|ture, was liable to an Abu&s;e, which aro&s;e even from its Excellence. That the Prin|ciple of <HI>parliamentary Influence</HI> which was thought or found nece&s;&s;ary at the Revolu|tion in Eighty-eight, as a new Principle of Government, had con&s;pired with the Lux|ury and ruling Manners of the Times, to weaken the national Powers, by rai&s;ing many Men to Places of the mo&s;t important Tru&s;t, who were in &s;ome Re&s;pect or other unequal to the Ta&s;k: And hence the ac|cumulated Danger to the Stability of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">THIS is the main Outline of the Au|thor's De&s;ign, &s;trip'd of that Particularity and Variety of colouring, which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give it, ere it could be made a ju&s;t and &s;triking Picture of the Times. All that circum&s;tantial Delineation of the ruling Character of each Rank, Condition, Order, or Profe&s;&s;ion of Men, being indeed no more than what the Writer intended as a Proof in Detail, of the&s;e general Prin|ciples.</P>
<P>THE Reception which the Work hath met with in the World, is a Proof &s;uffi|cient, how thoroughly the main Body of the Nation is convinced of the general Truth and Utility of the Plan. As to the Exe|cution of it; whoever con&s;iders the Na|ture of the Work; and that in the Cour&s;e of particular Proof, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak with uncommon Freedom concern|ing the real State of all Ranks and Orders
<PB N="11" REF="14">
of Men, will ea&s;ily &s;ee that Numbers mu&s;t be di&s;plea&s;ed at a Freedom which was per|haps <HI>new,</HI> but which the very Genius of the Work rendered <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT Foundation this particular Di&s;|plea&s;ure of Individuals may have had in Rea&s;on, and what in Pa&s;&s;ion and Self-Partiality, I will now calmly con&s;ider; in weighing tho&s;e Objections which your Lord&s;hip hath laid before me.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;ay, my Lord, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"many good and well meaning People have taken Offence, as being involved in the blame|able Manners of the Times, and there|fore charged with Guilt, as the Enemies of their Country, while they are not con|&s;cious of acting <HI>intentionally ami&s;s.</HI>"</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">IN reply to this, my Lord, let me briefly quote my Vindication from &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Book it&s;elf.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is not affirmed or imply'd, in this general Review, that every Individual hath a&s;&s;umed the Garb and Character of fal&s;e Delicacy.&mdash;As in manly Ages, &s;ome will be effeminate, &s;o, in effeminate Times, the manly Character will be found."</Q>
&mdash;But from
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the general Combination of Manners and Principles, in every Period of Time, will always re&s;ult one ruling and predo|minant Character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 65.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>YET altho' it be true, that the Character of guilty Effeminacy belongs not to all; it &s;eems to the Writer, that none are exempt from &s;ome Degree or other of tho&s;e ruling Manners, which, when indulged beyond a certain Degree, con&s;titute the Character of guilty Effeminacy. He cannot acquit his
<PB N="13" REF="16">
be&s;t and worthie&s;t Friends of &s;ome Parti|cipation with the Defects of their Time and Country. Nor doth he pretend to be exempt from them him&s;elf. Alas, if he did, he mu&s;t be the blinde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elf-ignorant of all Mortals! The&s;e Man|ners are, in a certain Degree, in-wrought into our very Nature by the Force of early Habit; then become, as it were, a Part of us: and we might as well attempt to dive&s;t our&s;elves of the Modes of Speech, as of the Modes of Thought and Action which are peculiar to our Time and Coun|try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Virtuous and vicious ev'ry Man mu&s;t be,</L>
<L>Few in th' extreme, but all in the Degree:</L>
<L>The Rogue and Fool by Fits is fair and wi&s;e;</L>
<L>And ev'n the be&s;t, by Fits, what they de&s;pi&s;e.</L></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, as no Period is without its De|fects, &s;o by early Habit, we are all nece&s;&s;a|rily doomed to a Participation of the&s;e De|fects. Hence, all Characters are imper|fect;
<PB N="14" REF="17">
not only from their internal Frame and Pa&s;&s;ions; but from their external Ha|bits of Education. But where the Scales fairly preponderate on the Side of Rea&s;on and Virtue; there, tho' the Character be <HI>imperfect,</HI> it is not <HI>vicious.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, not only the worthie&s;t are in &s;ome Degree nece&s;&s;arily tinctured with the ruling Errors of the Times; but I will go a Step further, my Lord, and affirm,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Men may be involved in the Manners of the Times, to a Degree that is even perni|cious, and yet not be ju&s;tly &s;tigmatized as immoral or unworthy Characters, &s;o as to become ju&s;tly the Objects of Ha|tred or Dete&s;tation."</Q></P>
<P>TO prove that I am not cooking up a new Sy&s;tem in my own Defence, different from the Principles of the E&s;timate, I mu&s;t again have Recour&s;e to the E&s;timate it&s;elf
<PB N="15" REF="18">
The following Paragraph is deci&s;ive.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Se|veral Habits, Qualities, and Actions, which &s;eem innocent in them&s;elves, as they affect or influence <HI>private</HI> Life, are equally or more hurtful than others of a more odious Appearance, if we con|&s;ider them as they affect the <HI>public</HI> Strength and Welfare. This comes to pa&s;s, becau&s;e the ill Con&s;equences of &s;ome Actions are <HI>immediate</HI>; of others, more <HI>di&s;tant.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;trike the <HI>Imagination,</HI> and are &s;een by all: The latter mu&s;t be traced up to their Cau&s;es by the U&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>; and to do this, exceeds the Ta|lents of the Many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 11. p. 173.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>GIVE the Author Leave now, my Lord, to apply this Truth fairly and candidly in his own Defence: A U&s;e, which he little dreamt, when he writ it, that he &s;hould ever have Occa&s;ion to apply it to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">WHEN, therefore, the Author charged his Contemporaries with indulging Man|ners pernicious to the public Welfare, he never intended to charge ALL who thus indulged them, with any de&s;igned Immo|rality or Guilt. The&s;e Manners, it ap|pears, do not nece&s;&s;arily imply an immoral Character, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e; becau&s;e, tho they be attended with di&s;tant Con&s;e|quences which are bad, nay perhaps fatal, yet the&s;e Con&s;equences are not always per|ceived or &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who are in|volved in them. There is, in this Ca&s;e, no Idea, no Su&s;picion of any Violation of Duty; the Con&s;equences are perhaps too di&s;tant to be &s;een by every Eye; and there|fore, &s;trictly &s;peaking, no moral Guilt or Demerit can ari&s;e. Yet the&s;e Manners (to cite another Pa&s;&s;age which may convince you that the Writer's Defence is built on his fir&s;t Principles)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tho' in Appearance they are too trite to merit Notice, and
<PB N="17" REF="20">
too trifling for Rebuke, may in their Tendency be as fatal to the Stability of a Nation, as Maxims and Manners more apparently flagitious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 29.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>NOW, the&s;e Manners, my Lord, which are thus fraught with hidden and un&s;een Mi&s;chief, ought &s;urely to be laid open in all their Con&s;equences, no le&s;s than Man|ners more apparently flagitious. Nay, there is indeed the greater Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a Developement, becau&s;e without it, even the worthy and well-intentioned may be drawn in, while they &s;u&s;pect no &s;uch Con&s;equence, to adopt a Sy&s;tem of Man|ners de&s;tructive to their Country.</P>
<P>LET the following Paragraph (apply'd, indeed, in the Book it&s;elf to a different Purpo&s;e) &s;erve as a concurrent Proof of what is here a&s;&s;erted.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The more trite
<PB N="18" REF="21">
and trifling the Facts may &s;eem, the more their Con&s;equences are likely to e&s;cape Notice: For Attention is natu|rally fixed only on Things of manife&s;t Importance. Now, if indeed, notwith|&s;tanding this, they be in their Tendency as fatal to the Stability of a Nation, as Maxims and Manners more apparently flagitious; then it may be not only a Ta&s;k of &s;ome Importance, but of &s;ome Delicacy too, to trace them to their Con&s;equences and Sources<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 54.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THIS, my Lord, may be called the <HI>&s;e|cond Degree,</HI> in which the Writer e&s;teems his Country very generally infected with that Sy&s;tem of Manners, which he hath attempted to di&s;grace. But neither in this Degree, does he think that moral Guilt is chargeable on the Delinquents; nor did he ever charge them with it, &s;o as to en|endeavour
<PB N="19" REF="22">
to render Individuals the Objects of Hatred and Dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>BUT there is a <HI>third Degree</HI> of Dege|neracy, which the Writer e&s;teems the pro|per Object of &s;evere Cen&s;ure and Reproof; and that is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When thro' a determined Pur&s;uit of Gain or Plea&s;ure, manife&s;t ill Con&s;equences are willfully overlooked and &s;ea&s;onable Admonitions neglected; or when the&s;e Con&s;equences are &s;een, and Admonitions attended to; yet deli|berately de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;et at Defiance."</Q>
Now this Degree of Degeneracy, my Lord, the Author believes and hopes, is not very common: Indeed, the very Tenor of his Work, the very e&s;&s;ential Principles on which he &s;et out, imply and affirm the con|trary. For if this had been the Repre&s;en|tation he had de&s;igned to make of his Times and Country, he mu&s;t have regarded and branded them as <HI>profligate.</HI> Now &s;o
<PB N="20" REF="23">
far from this, that he hath expre&s;sly af|med, as a fundamental Principle of his Work, that the Character of the Times is NOT that of profligacy.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;lighte&s;t Ob&s;ervation, if attended with Impartiality, may convince us, that the Character of the Manners of this Age and Nation, is by no means that of abandoned Wick|edne&s;s and Profligacy. This Degree of Degeneracy, indeed, is often imputed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 26.</NOTE> to the Times; but to what Times hath it not been imputed?"</Q>
Again:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the previous E&s;timate, already given, be ju&s;t; if the Spirit of Liberty, Humanity, and Equity, be in a certain Degree yet left among us, &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Foundations of abandoned Wickedne&s;s and Profligacy can have no Place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 28.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>YET, my Lord, tho' the&s;e atrocious Crimes have no Place among us, &s;o as to
<PB N="21" REF="24">
form the Character of a People, the Wri|ter can entertain no Doubt, but there are Characters in every Rank and Station of Life, who may ju&s;tly de&s;erve the Style of <HI>profligate.</HI> This is often &s;uppo&s;ed, in the Cour&s;e of the E&s;timate; the&s;e Characters, with their Effects on the public Welfare, are incidentally touched on: But as the general Tenor and Complexion of the Work &s;uppo&s;es, that the general Character of the Times is totally different from this; no candid Reader, &s;ure, will charge the Writer with imputing this Profligacy to any parti|cular Character, unle&s;s where it is PARTI|CULARLY AFFIRMED and IMPUTED.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH, then, my Lord, is the general Foundation of the Writer's main De|fence: A Defence which, if every one had known his Sentiments of Men and
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Things, as well as your Lord&s;hip, he is per&s;uaded he never could have had Occa|&s;ion to make. And he hath only to apply the&s;e general Principles of Defence, to all tho&s;e Ranks, Conditions, Orders, and Pro|fe&s;&s;ions, which he hath &s;crutinized in his E&s;timate, in order to clear him&s;elf of this capital Objection.</P>
<P>THUS, when he affirms, that the leading Ranks in general are infected with the Manners of the Times, he means not to charge the leading Ranks with a general Profligacy or deliberate Guilt. He believes them involved, from their Situation, in a Sy&s;tem of Manners, and in very various Degrees of the&s;e Manners, which, if not attended to, and curbed in their Exce&s;s, will &s;oon or late endanger the Stability of the Commonwealth. But he believes, at the &s;ame Time, nay, and knows it too, that many among the&s;e leading Ranks are
<PB N="23" REF="26">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Qualities truly amiable. He only thinks, and hath a&s;&s;erted what he thinks, that they extend not their Views to di&s;tant or future Con&s;equences; but heedle&s;&s;ly adopt a Sy&s;tem of Manners, which, if unchecked in their Progre&s;s, will be attended with &s;uch Effects as they them&s;elves would tremble to behold.</P>
<P>HE regards the Armies of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as being le&s;s gro&s;&s;ly vicious than in former Times: He applauds their Valour in par|ticular In&s;tances: But he points out, what all indifferent People acknowledge, that the ruling Character of the Times hath naturally drawn them into a Sy&s;tem of Man|ners, which tends to the De&s;truction of mi|litary Spirit.</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame Kind are his Strictures on the Navy. Nay, here he acknowledgeth In&s;tances of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Bravery.
<PB N="24" REF="27">
He laments the public Act of their Coun|try, which con&s;pired with the Manners of the Times, and expo&s;ed the&s;e Gentlemen to the Temptations of Gain, in Preference to Views of Duty. He affirms, that their Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s is not properly a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Guilt, but the natural Effect of their <HI>Situation,</HI> in &s;uch a <HI>Period,</HI> and in &s;uch a <HI>Nation</HI>; for that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they are brave, hardy, and in|trepid, till they ri&s;e to the higher Com|mands; and then the Example and Manners of the Time infect them*."</Q></P>
<P>HE hath treated his own Profe&s;&s;ion with the &s;ame Freedom and Impartiality: But what is remarkable here, is, that while &s;ome cry aloud again&s;t him for his ill U&s;age of his own Profe&s;&s;ion, others affirm he hath done it more than Ju&s;tice. For it &s;eems, he hath affirmed that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the middle Ranks of this Profe&s;&s;ion there are more good Qualities found than in
<PB N="25" REF="28">
any other."</Q>
This indeed he thinks is true; and re&s;olves it, not into the &s;uperior per&s;onal Virtue of the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> but into the Nature of the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> it&s;elf; which, among the middle Ranks, contains and pre&s;ents &s;tronger Motives to Virtue, and more effctual Bars to Vice, than any other Profe&s;&s;ion he knows of. Now, as he judgeth of the Virtues, &s;o doth he judge of the Failings, or, if you will, the Vices of this Order. Per&s;onal Vices he never thought of meddling with, but only the Vices of Rank and Profe&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially &s;uch as the Manners of the Times inflame. Now, it is manife&s;t, that all tho&s;e of this Profe&s;&s;ion, who
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"conver&s;e with the World, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to make Part of it,"</Q>
without Regard to their <HI>particular Rank,</HI> &s;tand expo&s;ed to Temptations, Follies, and Vices, which the more retired Part of the Profe&s;&s;ion are not expo&s;ed to. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, it is hard to &s;ay, where
<PB N="26" REF="29">
per&s;onal and moral Guilt begins; but this he adventures to &s;ay, that many well-meaning Men in the Profe&s;&s;ion may be in|volved in Manners and Habits which are con&s;equentially pernicious, tho' &s;eemingly innocent. This Conduct is often the Ef|fect of Inattention: doubtle&s;s, it is &s;ome|times the Re&s;ult of deliberate De&s;ign: Where the Boundaries lie, the Writer pre|tends not to determine: neither indeed is it nece&s;&s;ary for his main Purpo&s;e, that he &s;hould determine; becau&s;e his main Purpo&s;e was only to point out and pre|vent <HI>Con&s;equences:</HI> And Con&s;equences will equally ari&s;e, from any &s;uppo&s;ed Sy&s;tem of Conduct, whether that Conduct ari&s;eth from mere <HI>Inattention,</HI> or from moral <HI>De|pravity</HI> of Heart.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to the political Leaders of the People, every Man who reads his Work with an Eye of Candour and Im|partiality,

The&s;e Virtues, yet left among us, do not only form amiable Characters in the common Intercour&s;es of private Life; but in his Opinion may form a fair Founda|tion on which to build tho&s;e public Vir|tues, the Lo&s;s of which he affirms and la|ments<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>. It is the Idea of a Public that,

in his Opinion, is too generally lo&s;t: It is the Force of Religion that is too generally no more: It is the Principle of virtuous and public Honour, that in his E&s;timation is too generally dwindled into unmanly Vanity. Thus, while the Manners of the Times are in many In&s;tances amiable and alluring, as they regard private Life and particular Connexions; the great Bonds of public Strength, the Sinews of the Com|monwealth, the Manners and Principles which &s;hould be the Soul of the State, &s;hould unite all its Members into one Body, vigorous, &s;trong, and terrible to its Enemies, the&s;e, in his Opinion, have been relaxed into Weakne&s;s, and Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>NAY, even the great ruling Evil of par|liamentary Influence, who&s;e Effects, on the national Strength, he hath been &s;o bold in di&s;clo&s;ing; and at which, he believes, the Great have taken mo&s;t Offence;&mdash;even this
<PB N="29" REF="32">
ruling Evil, he believes, hath made its Progre&s;s in many In&s;tances, through the mere Blindne&s;s, and Inattention of the Par|ties concerned; who bent only on private Advantage, or perhaps actuated only by the Reputation and Honour annexed to an ex|ten&s;ive Influence (a View no ways blameable while con&s;i&s;tent with the Welfare of the Public) and not con&s;cious of tho&s;e Effects which naturally aro&s;e from &s;uch a Conduct, have often immer&s;ed them&s;elves in all the Wretchedne&s;s of Party Violence and Bo|rough-jobbing, without any ill Intention to the State.

by rai&s;ing Men to public Of|fices of Tru&s;t and Importance, who were unequal to their Station both in Capacity, public Spirit, and other nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tions. But altho' he thinks thus of many of his Fellow Subjects, he cannot be &s;o blindly credulous, as to think thus of all: He cannot doubt, but there are &s;ome, who would hire them&s;elves out to &s;ale, would ob&s;truct whole&s;ome Mea&s;ures, would for|ward bad ones, in order to force them&s;elves into lucrative Employments, and enrich them&s;elves, their Families, and Depen|dants, tho' the Di&s;order or the Ruin of the State were the fore&s;een and certain Con&s;equence. Yet, how many of the&s;e Characters may infe&s;t the Nation, or where &s;uch Characters are to be looked for, he neither hath affirmed, nor even in&s;inuated. His De&s;ign was of a far different Nature,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not to make per&s;onal Applications, but to trace acknowledged Facts to their un|&s;een

Whether, there|fore, di&s;hone&s;t Intentions were concerned or not, was of no e&s;&s;ential Import to his capital De&s;ign; which was only to point out the <HI>dangerous Effects</HI> of &s;uch a ruling Sy&s;|tem of <HI>Policy,</HI> whether it was founded in <HI>blamele&s;s</HI> or in <HI>wicked Intention.</HI></P>
<P>ON the&s;e Foundations then, my Lord, the Author of the E&s;timate re&s;ts his De|fence. He affirms, what, indeed, the greater Part of his Readers are well &s;atis|fied of, that he never meant to &s;tigmatize or point out per&s;onal Defects or Vices, but only tho&s;e of Rank, of Profe&s;&s;ion, of the Times. He hath in Con&s;equence of this Principle endeavoured to lay open the pe|culiar Defects incident to each Rank and Profe&s;&s;ion; but no where hath he de&s;ign|edly pointed out the particular Men which are chargeable with the&s;e Defects. So far is he from re&s;olving the&s;e general Defects
<PB N="32" REF="35">
or Vices into per&s;onal and deliberate Guilt, that he thinks it po&s;&s;ible, that if the lead|ing Ranks and the middle Ranks of the Nation were to change <HI>Places,</HI> they might change <HI>Characters</HI> too: That many of tho&s;e who are now borne down by the Manners of the Times, might, thro' &s;uch a Change of Situation, &s;tand entirely clear of them; and many of tho&s;e who now &s;tand clear of them, might be over-whelmed by their prevailing Influence. But if the Writer was to e&s;timate the moral Merit or De|merit of private and per&s;onal Characters (a Thing which came not within his De|&s;ign) he would &s;urely go another Way to Work: He would not weigh <HI>Con&s;equences,</HI> &s;o much as <HI>Intentions:</HI> He would con&s;ider, who were delinquent thro' <HI>Inadvertence,</HI> and who thro' <HI>deliberate De&s;ign.</HI> As he never did this; as nothing of this Kind makes any Part of his Work; as he hath in many Places declared the very contrary; it
<PB N="33" REF="36">
is evident, that he never meant to charge In|dividuals with moral Guilt; but, in one Word,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to e&s;timate the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Manners and Principles, in which the particular State of the Times hath naturally, in &s;ome Degree or other, in|volved <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> his <HI>Friends,</HI> and his COUNTRY."</Q></P>
<P>I FORESEE, my Lord, an Objection may ri&s;e to the Propriety of this Defence. It may be a&s;ked,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the&s;e Manners and Principles of the Times are properly treated here with <HI>Gentlene&s;s,</HI> why in the E&s;timate it&s;elf are they often treated with <HI>Severity?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THE Reply to this Objection, my Lord, is ea&s;y; and not only con&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the Defence, but indeed e&s;&s;en|tially founded on it. In this Defence, the author hath con&s;idered the Manners and
<PB N="34" REF="37">
Principles of the Times, as they affect the <HI>Intentions</HI> of tho&s;e who are involved in them: their Intentions, he &s;uppo&s;es, to be in many In&s;tances, void of <HI>deliberate</HI> Guilt: therefore, when he regards them in this Light, he regards them as not chargeable with moral Profligacy, and therefore to be treated with <HI>Gentlene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in the E&s;timate it&s;elf, he con|&s;idered the Manners and Principles of the Times, &s;olely with regard to their <HI>Con&s;e|quences.</HI> The&s;e, he thought, were pernicious, and fatal: and therefore the Manners and Principles which led to them, were, in his Opinion, to be di&s;played as being perni|cious and fatal; and therefore, in this Re|gard, to be treated with <HI>Severity.</HI></P>
<P>IT is farther urged, it &s;eems,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Writer hath acted with a blameable Partiality, in painting the ruling Fol|lies

and Vices of the Times with the utmo&s;t, and even aggravated Severity; but hath given few or no Virtues to compen&s;ate: whereas an E&s;timator of the Times ought to have been <HI>impar|tial</HI>; and &s;hould have <HI>commended,</HI> as well as <HI>blamed.</HI>"</Q></P>

<P><PB N="46" REF="49">LET us conclude then, my Lord, that whoever has the <HI>Power,</HI> has likewi&s;e the <HI>Right,</HI> to command the national Attention.

Individuals, be In&s;olence, Arrogance and Dogmati&s;m, the Writer &s;tands guilty of the Charge: But if this be not the ca&s;e, if the Accu&s;ation be founded in the mere Want of tho&s;e frequent and common <HI>Apologies, Re&s;erves, Exceptions, Salvo's</HI> and <HI>Douceurs,</HI> by which Writers are apt to court the &s;elf-love or Malice of the World, and by which every Reader is happily prevented from <HI>ap|plying</HI> any thing to <HI>him&s;elf</HI>; The Writer ap|prehends, that in this Ca&s;e he is not <HI>a&s;|&s;uming,</HI> but that he did his Duty in being explicit and <HI>intelligible.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is, in this re&s;pect, an e&s;&s;en|tial Difference between <HI>Writing</HI> and <HI>Speak|ing.</HI> The Speaker's private Rank and Character is nece&s;&s;arily attended to; be|cau&s;e from his per&s;onal Pre&s;ence, per&s;onal Con&s;iderations will (contrary to what is right) intermix them&s;elves.

he lo&s;es the Benefits of &s;uperior Station on one Hand, on the other the Want of them ought not to be imputed.

Are the Follies and Vices attacked, of a public or private Nature? If public, they are of public Cog|nizance; and the Accu&s;er is not to be told, that he has no Right to accu&s;e; becau&s;e he is of an inferior Station: It is enough, that he is a Fellow-Member of the Commu|nity.

of mo&s;t <HI>effectual Service</HI> to his COUNTRY?

The latter knows his Station, and hopes he conducts him&s;elf in it with Humility and Propriety. The Per&s;ons of the Great he treats with due Re&s;pect, and in Point of Decency, (and perhaps of Dignity too) maintains his Di&s;tance: As a Writer, he is a little more familiar with their Vices, when they interfere with the Welfare of his Country; becau&s;e <HI>the&s;e</HI> are not the Ob|jects of his Reverence; not even of his external Reverence, as they have no Place, Rank, or Titles of Honour legally annex|ed to them (that he knows of) in this
<PB N="51" REF="54">
Kingdom. As his Cen&s;ures therefore are <HI>general,</HI> and nor <HI>particular,</HI> he thinks, he may arraign the <HI>Vice,</HI> and yet pre&s;erve due Re&s;pect to the <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER; tho' he held this Principle of Conduct to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and therefore <HI>ju&s;t</HI>; yet, like every other Principle, it cer|tainly hath its proper Bounds: Nor does the Writer pretend to erect him&s;elf into an ab&s;olute Judge of the Propriety of his own Conduct, in every In&s;tance.

<P>BUT you add, my Lord, that &s;uppo|&s;ing the Repre&s;entations ju&s;t, which the Writer of the E&s;timate hath given of his Times and Country, it is farther ob|jected,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that as the Book has been tran&s;|lated into foreign Tongues, and made its Way on the <HI>Continent,</HI> it has given Advantage and Encouragement to our Enemies, by painting this Nation as be|ing &s;unk in Effeminacy."</Q></P>
<P>ALAS! my Lord, our Enemies knew our Weakne&s;s and Degeneracy before: the national Di&s;graces had proclaimed it. As to the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> and <HI>Remedies</HI> of this political Degeneracy, the Knowledge of the&s;e could only affect our&s;elves. We

might reap Advantage, (if we &s;o plea&s;ed) by being led to the Knowledge and Sen&s;e of the&s;e: Our Enemies had already reaped all the Advantages of Information, from the mere Knowledge of the <HI>Fact.</HI> Is a Nation to go quietly down to Ruin, with|out one awakening Voice to rouze it from its fatal Lethargy, merely through Fear that our Enemies &s;hould take Advantage? They &s;aw we were a&s;leep: they had &s;ur|prized and attacked us in our Slumber: Sure, it could not be dangerous or hurtful, to awaken from its Dream a Nation &s;o ex|po&s;ed and attacked. Nor could it le&s;&s;en that Nation in another's Eyes, to &s;ee there was one bold enough to attempt it.</P>
<P>BUT, it &s;eems,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Alarm was &s;o &s;trong, that it was in Danger of throw|ing the Nation from a State of blind <HI>Security,</HI> into a State of <HI>De&s;pair.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">THIS, my Lord, is the vague Language of undi&s;tingui&s;hing Objectors; and &s;avours little of the Knowledge of Human Nature. Would to God, the Feelings of the Guilty were &s;o delicate; but to bring that Part of the Nation which was &s;unk in blind <HI>Se|curity,</HI> to the oppo&s;ite Extreme of <HI>De|&s;pair,</HI> is, by no Means, an ea&s;y Task. There are many intermediate Periods to be gone through, of Doubt, Su&s;picion, Fear, De&s;pondency, 'ere the di&s;&s;olute Mind can arrive at this Extreme.

blamele&s;s.&mdash;Farther, that &s;par|ing Hand, with which the Author thought it nece&s;&s;ary to mingle Panegyric in his Work, hath undoubtedly been the Occa|&s;ion of much Di&s;content.&mdash;Again, the open and unre&s;erved Manner in which the E&s;timate is written; the &s;eeming Danger of telling &s;o much political Truth to the World, &s;uppo&s;ing the Repre&s;entations true;&mdash;All the&s;e, my Lord, have been undoubt|edly regarded as improper or imprudent Steps; and declaimed again&s;t, as &s;uch, by Men of good Intentions.</P>
<P>FOR a Reply to the&s;e Objections, your Lord&s;hip is referred to the preceding Let|ters. There are other Cau&s;es of Cla|mour, I apprehend, of a very different Nature; and I will point out the&s;e with the &s;ame Freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">ONE Source of Clamour hath been the ob&s;tinate Blindne&s;s of the <HI>di&s;&s;olute,</HI> in every Rank and Station; who, being determined to proceed in the beaten Track of Plea|&s;ure, without Regard to Con&s;equences, do therefore naturally di&s;like tho&s;e who di&s;play them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, my Lord, the more Truth ap|pears in a Work of this Nature, by which the Intere&s;ts of Individuals are &s;o nearly af|fected, the more Enemies the Work mu&s;t have among a certain Party of Men: I mean all that Party who look no farther than them&s;elves, and are watching to plun|der the Public for their own private Emo|lument. How large a Party this may be, or where they may lie, the Writer leaves to your Lord&s;hip to determine.

<P>I PROCEED, my Lord, to your la&s;t Objection. It &s;eems,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Freedom with which the Character of a famous Mini&s;ter is treated, hath been the Oc|ca&s;ion of much Offence to his Friends and Adherents, which form a large and powerful Party in this Kingdom."</Q></P>
<P>AS to the mere Matter of <HI>Offence,</HI> my Lord, there is no preventing it in certain Ca&s;es. But if the Writer was to calculate <HI>Numbers</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, he finds the <HI>Majority</HI> would con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e who think he hath treated the Character of this Mi|ni&s;ter at lea&s;t with <HI>&s;ufficient Lenity.</HI> 'Tis certainly a Kind of Pre&s;umption in his Favour, that one Part of the Nation thinks he hath allowed <HI>too little</HI>; and others, <HI>too much,</HI> to this decea&s;ed Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68">BE that as it may; the Inve&s;tigation of this Mini&s;ter's Principles and Conduct is certainly of national Concern: It is of great Importance to this Kingdom, that it be known whether his political Sy&s;tem be <HI>&s;a|lutary</HI> or <HI>de&s;tructive:</HI> therefore the Character of his Admini&s;tration not only <HI>may,</HI> but <HI>ought</HI> to be freely and fairly canva&s;&s;ed, for the Conviction and Benefit of the Whole.</P>
<P>HAD the Writer treated this Mini&s;ter's Character with Contempt, there had been &s;ome Pretence for Blame: As he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided every thing of this Kind, he can|not but be a&s;toni&s;hed, that Men of Can|dour and fair Intentions can be offended at his cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Rea&s;onings on this Subject. He never entertained any per|&s;onal Di&s;like to this Mini&s;ter, his Friends, or Adherents. On the contrary, he knows &s;ome of them to be Men of Worth and Honour, the Friends of Liberty and their
<PB N="66" REF="69">
Country; and for who&s;e Characters, he were both unju&s;t and in&s;en&s;ible if he had not the highe&s;t Deference: If he differs from the&s;e Gentlemen in Point of Opi|nion, they are &s;atisfied he does it from the Convictions of his own Rea&s;on. They know, he proceeds on the &s;ame Principles of Liberty with them&s;elves; that he only di&s;&s;ents in his Conclu&s;ions; and are too ju&s;t and generous, to di&s;like him for throw|ing out his Sentiments &s;o freely, on a Sub|ject of &s;uch Importance.</P>
<P>Is the Writer mi&s;taken in his Opinions concerning the Conduct of this Mini&s;ter? The Pre&s;s is open to every body: Why then is <HI>Clamour</HI> &s;pread, in&s;tead of rational <HI>Confutation?</HI> To tie down the Nation to this Sy&s;tem, to forbid or di&s;courage ra|tional Inquiry into its Tendency, would be to erect a political Tyranny in the State. If it is clear then, that the Writer's Inten|tions
<PB N="67" REF="70">
are hone&s;t, the Friends of this Mi|ni&s;ter will find it equitable to make Al|lowance for Difference in Opinion. What they contend for in <HI>Religion,</HI> will they de|ny in <HI>Politics?</HI> Certainly, my Lord, the Maxims of <HI>arbitrary Power</HI> &s;it with the wor&s;t Grace on the declared Patrons of <HI>Freedom.</HI></P>
<P>IT were perhaps unfair to charge any of the more <HI>generous</HI> Part of this decea&s;ed Mini&s;ter's Friends, with joyning in the Cla|mours rai&s;ed on this Occa&s;ion. That no candid and equitable Mind can be di&s;gu&s;ted at his Conduct, he concludes from the ge|nerous Profe&s;&s;ions of a late Writer, &s;o nearly connected with this Mini&s;ter, that his Evidence mu&s;t be allowed above all Su&s;picion.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This Freedom of Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the Dead of any Rank, or however con&s;ecrated by the Authority of great Names, or even by the E&s;teem of Ages,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
every Man ought to be at Liberty to ex|erci&s;e. The greate&s;t Men certainly may be mi&s;taken; &s;o may even the Judgment of Ages, which often takes Opinions upon Tru&s;t. No Authority, under Di|vine, is too great to be called in Que|&s;tion: And however venerable Mo|narchy may be in a State, no Man ever wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Government of Let|ters, under any Form but that of a <HI>Re|public.</HI> As a Citizen of that Common|wealth, I propo&s;e my Sentiments for the Revi&s;ion of any Decree, of any ho|norary Sentence, as <HI>I think fit:</HI> My Fel|low Citizens, <HI>equally free,</HI> will vote ac|cording to their Opinions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Mr. WALPOLE's Catalogue of royal and noble Authors.</NOTE>."</Q>
&mdash;Such are this Gentleman's free and generous Prin|ciples on the like Occa&s;ion: And the Wri|ter is well per&s;uaded, that this honourable Per&s;on is too equitable to refu&s;e that Pri|vilege to another, which he &s;o rationally a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf.</P>

<P>SUCH, then, my Lord, is the Writer's Reply to the &s;everal Objections which you tell me have been urged again&s;t his E&s;timate. How far it may be &s;atisfactory he pretends not to determine; but leaves every Man to weigh it with candid Free|dom.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave now, my Lord, to clo&s;e this Defence with a few Ob&s;ervations, which may &s;till farther tend to clear the Doubts of tho&s;e who have &s;tarted the Ob|jections.</P>
<P>LET them con&s;ider, my Lord, that in a Subject &s;o wide, multifarious, and compli|cated,
<PB N="72" REF="75">
as that of the Manners and Prin|ciples of a wealthy and luxurious Nation, there are not perhaps two Individuals of that Nation, who&s;e Opinions do altogether coincide. Every Man that examines &s;uch a Subject, proceeds not only on a View of <HI>Facts,</HI> but on a Set of <HI>Principles</HI> too, in &s;ome Degree <HI>different</HI> from tho&s;e of every other. The Body of the Nation, which hath been &s;o partial in Favour of this E&s;|timate, &s;hould they compare their parti|cular Opinions, would find them widely different in many Circum&s;tances: and tho&s;e among the higher Ranks who have di&s;&s;ented, &s;hould they enter into the &s;ame critical and minute Compari&s;on of each others Thoughts, would find them equally di&s;cordant. If &s;o, my Lord; is not here a manife&s;t Rea&s;on for mutual Forbearance, where Opinions cla&s;h? And who will deny that it was a Ta&s;k of the greate&s;t Difficulty, to &s;teer thro' &s;uch a Sea of
<PB N="73" REF="76">
Doubt, where (though the Facts lie open to every Man's Ob&s;ervation) every Man forms an Opinion peculiar to him&s;elf. The great Outlines, the e&s;&s;ential Truths, the leading Principles of &s;uch a Work may be acknowledged to be ju&s;t by Thou&s;ands, who, amid&s;t that infinite Variety of Cir|cum&s;tances glanced at in the Cour&s;e of it, may have particular Opinions different from the Author and each other. All, therefore, that a mode&s;t Writer will pre|tend in &s;uch a Ca&s;e to give, or a mode&s;t Reader expect to <HI>find,</HI> will be <HI>a good deal of Truth,</HI> and <HI>a little Error.</HI></P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of this, my Lord, con|&s;ider farther, how often and how naturally particular Pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ob|jected to, in &s;uch a Work, while the ge|neral Truths and leading Principles, on which the Work is founded, are totally overlooked. For every Reader erects him|&s;elf
<PB N="74" REF="77">
into a Judge of the <HI>particular</HI> Remarks made, and pronounces on them by the Standard of his own Judgment, formed upon his own Ob&s;ervation and Principles: While, among the Multitude of Readers, even of tho&s;e who mean well, an extended Di&s;cernment of Things, and the Compre|hen&s;ion of a <HI>general Plan,</HI> is not always to be found. How ea&s;y a Ta&s;k then, my Lord, and how natural to weak, to vain, or ungenerous Minds, to throw out Ob|jections to particular <HI>Parts,</HI> without any Regard had to the main <HI>Tenor, Extent,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the <HI>Whole?</HI></P>

He only &s;aw one proper Expedient; which was, to give the predominant or leading Character of the &s;everal Ranks concerned; yet to admit (in general Terms) that in each Rank there were <HI>Exceptions</HI> to this leading Character.

But he here a&s;&s;ures your Lord&s;hip, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, that the whole of this E&s;timate was the &s;ole Re&s;ult of his own Rea&s;on, uninfluenced by the Advice, or Direc|tion of any Friend whatever: And that, indeed, he thought the Subject of &s;o delicate a Nature, that it would have been
<PB N="77" REF="80">
ungenerous to have involved any Friend in the per&s;onal Con&s;equences which he fore|&s;aw it might produce. Had no di&s;agree|able Effects attended the Publication, he &s;hould not have judged it nece&s;&s;ary to make this Avowal; but as the Clamour and Di&s;plea&s;ure of certain Ranks have been the Con&s;equence of its Appearance and Succe&s;s, he thinks it a Duty incumbent on him to clear every Friend of this ground|le&s;s Imputation; and declares, that what|ever may appear in it either inadvertent, or erroneous, the Whole is to be at|tributed to him&s;elf alone; to the Over|flowings of his own Zeal, thrown out to the World without Di&s;gui&s;e, Expectation, or Fear; and bent, not again&s;t <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> but again&s;t the predominant Errors, Fol|lies, and Vices of his Time and Country. His Work hath had the Fate which might rea&s;onably be expected: it hath been <HI>read, approved, di&s;&s;ented</HI> from, and
<PB N="78" REF="81">
<HI>reviled.</HI> For the Conviction of tho&s;e who have candidly <HI>di&s;&s;ented,</HI> the Publication of the&s;e Letters may be of U&s;e: But when the Writer con&s;iders, by WHOM his Work hath been <HI>approved,</HI> and by WHOM <HI>reviled,</HI> as the fir&s;t of the&s;e Parties <HI>de&s;ire</HI> no Reply, &s;o the latter <HI>de&s;erve</HI> none: They have <HI>both</HI> done his Work all the Honour that is in their Power to give; and he cannot but e&s;teem its Fate to have been <HI>peculiarly happy.</HI> The wor&s;t that he wi&s;hes to his wor&s;t Enemy, is <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> and a <HI>better Mind.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole, my Lord, the Writer can but declare his upright Intentions, and leave the World to judge of their Propriety and Succe&s;s. He would de&s;ire his Coun|trymen to remember the generous Maxim of a true Politician,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a Patriot will admit there may be hone&s;t Men, and that hone&s;t Men may differ:"</Q>
And that,
<PB N="79" REF="82">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where the Heart is right, there is true Patrioti&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Berkley's Maxims.</HI></NOTE>."</Q>
He knows, it is the Principle of many good Men, that all At|tempts towards <HI>Innovation,</HI> of whatever Kind, are dangerous. For him&s;elf, he is of a different Opinion: He thinks that <HI>&s;eeming Innovation</HI> is, in many Ca&s;es, no more than the nece&s;&s;ary Means of <HI>prevent|ing</HI> a gradual and un&s;u&s;pected <HI>Change</HI> of Things for the wor&s;e, which inevitably &s;teals on in every State, if not checked by timely and re&s;olute Applications.</P>
<P>SO far is the Writer from imagining, with the Herd of Politicians, that there is no Virtue nor good Intention in any but tho&s;e who approve that Sy&s;tem of Politicks which He e&s;pou&s;es; that on the contrary, he makes no Doubt, but &s;ome of the Great, who had not the Courage to combat the ruling Evils of the Times, wi&s;hed &s;incerely to compa&s;s &s;uch an End, but judged the
<PB N="80" REF="83">
End unattainable. He is, therefore, the more &s;urpri&s;ed that Individuals &s;hould take Offence at this Part of his Work, becau&s;e it is pointed, not again&s;t the Conduct of Indi|viduals, but again&s;t the common and rul|ing Errors of the Times. He believes there are upright Men of all Parties, and only wi&s;hes they would believe &s;o of one another. His Approbation or Di&s;approba|tion is not of <HI>Men,</HI> but <HI>Mea&s;ures:</HI> And he is well per&s;uaded, that many of tho&s;e who once thought the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures of Go|vernment <HI>impracticable,</HI> begin now to &s;ee the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> as well as the great <HI>Importance</HI> of carrying on the public Affairs, on a higher Principle than that of <HI>venal</HI> In|fluence.</P>
<P>SO &s;udden and &s;o great is the Change in the Appearance of our public Affairs, in Con&s;equence of this &s;udden and coura|gious Check given to the ruling Manners and Principles of the Times, that the Wri|ter
<PB N="81" REF="84">
hath been &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether the ri&s;ing Courage of the Nation, our for|midable Armaments, and the gallant Spi|rit of &s;everal young Men of Fa&s;hion and Fortune, are not &s;o many Confutations of the Principles advanced in the <HI>E&s;ti|mate?</HI>"</Q>
Seriou&s;ly, my Lord, the Writer of the <HI>E&s;timate</HI> is right glad to be so CON|FUTED. Had the&s;e Appearances ri&s;en be|fore the Publication of his Work, he might ju&s;tly have been accu&s;ed of Partiality and Mi&s;repre&s;entation. But as it is confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e Appearances are but now <HI>ri&s;ing,</HI> he will only de&s;ire his Objectors to look back to the <HI>E&s;timate</HI> it&s;elf, and con&s;ider whe|ther they are not <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> on the very Principles there <HI>urged, delineated,</HI> and <HI>foretold.</HI> The Writer did indeed believe, he fore&s;aw, nay he foretold, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"NECESSITY alone could bring back effeminate and unprincipled Minds from their Attachments to Gain and Plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 220.</NOTE>."</Q>
Nay, he foretold the
<PB N="82" REF="85">
very Means:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Voice of an <HI>uncor|rupt People,</HI> and a GREAT MINISTER<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 221.</NOTE>."</Q>
Ca&s;t your Eye back, my Lord, to no very di&s;tant Day, and be You the Judge, what was the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and what the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the Time: Had not a general Di&s;&s;olution of Manners and of Principle di&s;ordered, nay, almo&s;t unhinged the State? This it was, that united the <HI>Voice,</HI> the <HI>legal Re|pre&s;entations,</HI> of an uncorrupted People: That united Voice, <HI>&s;teady,</HI> not <HI>factious&mdash;loyal,</HI> yet <HI>couragious</HI>&mdash;was heard and ap|proved by a GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN: The <HI>expected Mini&s;ter</HI> was found; and a <HI>coercive Power</HI> hath thus appeared from the <HI>Throne,</HI> &s;ufficient to controul the Blindne&s;s and Folly of the di&s;&s;olute and thoughtle&s;s a|mong the higher Ranks, and to lead them to <HI>&s;alutary Mea&s;ures</HI> and their own <HI>Safety.</HI></P>
<P>MARK the Effects of this uniting Power: <HI>private Good</HI> gives Way to <HI>public:</HI> the &s;e|veral
<PB N="83" REF="86">
Ranks a&s;&s;ume a Spirit and <HI>Fervor</HI> un|known before: Fear of <HI>Shame,</HI> and Thir&s;t of <HI>Honour,</HI> begin to &s;pread thro' our <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Armies</HI>; and our growing <HI>Youth</HI> &s;eem already to catch the kindling <HI>Fire.</HI> In a Word, the national Strength is awakened, and called forth into Action: The GENIUS of BRITAIN &s;eems ri&s;ing as from the <HI>Grave:</HI> he &s;hakes him&s;elf from the <HI>Du&s;t,</HI> a&s;&s;umes his ancient <HI>Port,</HI> and <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of Empire, and goes forth in his Might to <HI>overwhelm</HI> our <HI>Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude, my Lord, without &s;eriou&s;ly recommending to your particular Notice and Regard, two Ob&s;ervations, (which contain, indeed, the Sub&s;tance and End of the <HI>E&s;timate</HI> it&s;elf) ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent State of our public Affairs. The fir&s;t is, that by proper Exertions and well-directed Applications, the ruling <HI>Evils</HI> of an <HI>effeminate Period</HI> may be <HI>controuled:</HI> The Second is, that under our pre&s;ent Con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="84" REF="87">
the national Affairs may be carried on with <HI>Honour</HI> to the <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> (a Truth which, not long ago, many &s;erious Men did not believe) on a higher Principle than that of <HI>corrupt In|fluence.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, let us not be intoxicated with the Appearances of Succe&s;s: The Tree may <HI>blo&s;&s;om,</HI> and yet be <HI>bla&s;ted.</HI> The ruling De|fects and Evils of the Times are for the pre&s;ent <HI>controuled</HI> indeed, but not <HI>extirpated.</HI> The Remedy, tho' it begins to take Effect, is yet no more than <HI>temporary:</HI> The Di|&s;temper <HI>lurks,</HI> tho' the Symptoms begin to <HI>vani&s;h.</HI> Let tho&s;e who wi&s;h well to their Country, then, be watchful, and prepared again&s;t a Relap&s;e. 'Tis <HI>&s;omething,</HI> to have <HI>check'd</HI> the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> at its <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>; the per|fect <HI>Cure</HI> will require the <HI>Attention</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> of an <HI>Age.</HI></P>
