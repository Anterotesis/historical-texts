<P>_CHRISTIANITY is a pure, per|fect, rational, con&s;i&s;tent Sy&s;tem; it is a Revelation worthy the God of Truth and Wi&s;dom to di&s;pen&s;e; its Doctrines have a direct Tendency to mo|ralize the Powers and Faculties, and to eno|ble and dignify the human Nature; it &s;ets its true Profe&s;&s;ors free from ridiculous Ab|&s;urdities, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic Delu&s;ions; for its divine Author taught no Doctrines, en|joined no Precepts, but &s;uch as will bear the &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny, and mu&s;t be owned by every truly wi&s;e and judicious Per&s;on, to be well adapted, and nicely calculated, at once to di&s;play the Power and Mercy of God, as well as to enrich, con&s;olate, and make happy the Mind of every true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But how an In&s;titution, thus wi&s;ely de|&s;igned, ordered and e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould be &s;o greatly mi&s;taken, &s;o unhappily perverted, and &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented, is no le&s;s &s;ur|prizing than true; and therefore how much
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to be deplored and lamented! But why is this? How mu&s;t we account for the many delu&s;ive Tenets and de&s;tructive Errors, which are indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by a Sett of <HI>mo|dern Teachers,</HI> and readily embraced, by &s;o many Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. How? why, as the Papi&s;ts mi&s;takenly a&s;&s;ert Igno|rance to be the Mother of Devotion, we may truly &s;ay, Ignorance is the Parent of Error, Folly and Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But to what Kind of Ignorance may we a&s;cribe the Mi&s;takes of the Teachers, and the Folly of the People in being thus de|ceived? Doubtle&s;s to an Ignorance of the Word of God, the holy Scriptures, which are the only &s;ure Guide, the be&s;t Standard, and the mo&s;t certain Criterion, whereby to di&s;cern Truth from Fal&s;hood, Right from Wrong; but through Neglect of &s;earching tho&s;e &s;acred Pages, the poor People ea&s;ily become a Prey to every ignorant <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic Preacher</HI> that comes in their Way; hence we &s;ee &s;uch a plentiful Production of Novel Doctrines, and &s;uch an abundant Fruitful|ne&s;s of extravagant Follies, and de&s;tructive Errors, which are &s;o prevalent among us at this Day.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren and Fathers, &s;ee ye not what an Inundation of Error and Delu&s;i|on hath broken in upon us? Ob&s;erve you not the Overflowings of Immorality and Vice, which like a Torrent is over&s;preading our Land? Can you be unconcerned, when
<PB N="5" REF="5">
the dreadful Effects, and baneful Con&s;e|quences, are &s;o vi&s;ible and evident? Alas <HI>Virtue</HI> reclines her fainting Head! <HI>Morality</HI> is almo&s;t bani&s;hed but in Name! The golden Rule of doing to others as we would be done by, is neglected and di&s;regarded! How few advert to the plain Requi&s;ition of the Prophet, To do ju&s;tly, love Mercy, and walk humbly before the Lord? Surely it is too plain to be denied, we have for&s;aken the true Principles of the Go&s;pel. <HI>Chri&s;t|ianity</HI> has lo&s;t its powerful Influence upon us; and therefore the Practice of <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Good Works,</HI> is &s;o much neglected, &s;o little attended to. O ye Mini&s;ters, ye pro|fe&s;&s;ed Teachers, and In&s;tructors of Mankind, will not ye attempt to &s;tem the rapid Tor|rent, which threatens to carry all before it? There is no Way left, but to retreat to the primitive Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Principles of the Reformation. The&s;e, the&s;e con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;ted on, and powerfully in|culcated will, nay, the&s;e only can be, attended with the happy Effects of reclaiming the Peo|ple from Error, rectifying their Principles, and effectually producing Chri&s;tian Practices. As for you my Brethren, Brethren Profe&s;|&s;ors of the &s;ame Go&s;pel, let me entreat and conjure you, if ye would be true <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> again&s;t the Fallacy and Deceit of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as you would de&s;ire to be Proof again&s;t all Doctrines of Novelty, all erro|neous
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Principles, all dangerous and delu&s;ive Tenets; would you perceive and detect, and &s;o beware of deceiving Teachers, fal&s;e Pro|phets, hypocritical and pretended Mini&s;ters; in one Word, are ye &s;ollicitous to come to the Knowledge of the Truth as it is in Je&s;us, that &s;o ye may be &s;aved? &s;earch the Scrip|tures. Make this your con&s;tant Practice; for be a&s;&s;ured ye are in the utmo&s;t Danger of being mi&s;&s;ed and deceived, never more &s;o than at pre&s;ent. On the one Hand by the proud, &s;elf-pre&s;uming, God-re&s;i&s;ting <HI>Infidel,</HI> on the other by the credulous, un&s;criptural, unmeaning <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI> While the former is an open Enemy to the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, totally rejects every Article of the Chri&s;tian Faith, acts as far wide from the moralizing Precepts of the Go&s;pel as from Humility; the latter, the <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> deceives him&s;elf and others, by his meer Pretences to In&s;pi|ration; profe&s;&s;es to have received the Gifts of the Spirit, but gives no Evidence to a&s;certain the Truth of it; makes &s;olemn Declarations of being <HI>inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to preach to you, and only pretends to pray to God for &s;piritual Operations, Influences, and Impre&s;&s;ions, but after all 'tis plain to the Eye of di&s;cerning Rea&s;on, he means nothing but to make Gain of his Preten&s;ions to God|line&s;s; for, contrary to his mo&s;t &s;olemn Pre|ten&s;ions and Profe&s;&s;ions, he utterly denies any true, real, inward Motion, Operation, and
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Influence of the Spirit: And hence doth he bewilder, amu&s;e, and perplex the Ignorant and Unwary, by teaching un&s;ound, un&s;crip|tural Doctrine.</P>
<P>Take heed to your&s;elves. Beware of &s;uch pretended Teachers; for you are liable to be led by &s;uch, into a Maze of Antichri&s;tian Errors, and a Wilderne&s;s of un&s;criptural Per|plexities; &s;o as that your Danger, through their Means, may not ea&s;ily be e&s;caped, nor ever rectified. It is not a trifling Affair I am now addre&s;&s;ing you about; but it is, my Brethren, of the utmo&s;t Concern, and of the greate&s;t Importance, no le&s;s than your Souls are at &s;take, nothing le&s;s than an Eternity de|pends upon your being wi&s;e unto Salvation. For your Sakes, and in Regard to your Safety, &s;uffer me here to introduce &s;ome of the truly &s;criptural, orthodox Articles of the E&s;tabli&s;h|ed Church of <HI>England,</HI> which as they are a Kind of Epitome, or Abridgment of the Go&s;pel, I &s;hall &s;elect &s;uch of them as may be&s;t &s;erve our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, namely, to try and examine Doctrines and Teachers by, to detect Error, and di&s;cover Truth. By the&s;e let us determine our a&s;&s;ent to, or di&s;|&s;ent from, &s;uch Doctrines as are propo&s;ed to us, and I am verily per&s;uaded, we &s;hall e&s;cape Error, avoid Delu&s;ion, and be freed from Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Perhaps a fond Attachment to our excel|lent E&s;tabli&s;hed Church (of which I am a
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Member) may influence me rather to fix on this Form of &s;ound Words, than any other of Human Compo&s;ition; be it &s;o, I am (I think) herein ju&s;tified, fora&s;much as the&s;e Articles are &s;upported by, and built upon, the Holy Scriptures. Therefore I am un|concerned what our modern Teachers, and new pretended Divines, think or &s;ay of me; if they di&s;like, and are a&s;hamed of our Ar|ticles, I am not. For all our Chri&s;tian Bi|&s;hops (Heavens ble&s;s them!) and all our Church Par&s;ons (Lord have mercy on them!) <HI>they</HI> all own them, and &s;ub&s;cribe to them, ay and <HI>&s;wear</HI> to them too; and they are publickly printed in all our Common-Prayer Books; for what U&s;e think ye? but that we &s;hould read them, know them, be in&s;tructed in them, and always abide in them. God grant, Brethren, that we may! For if we are happily intere&s;ted in the great Truths they contain, vain will be all the artful At|tempts, &s;ubtile De&s;igns, and nefarious Stra|gems, of Men de&s;titute of the Truth, to mi&s;lead, pervert, or delude us.</P>
<P>To this End, I &s;hall now lay the Articles before you, make &s;ome Strictures upon them, and draw &s;ome Applications from them as I go along; God give us a right Judgment! We begin with the Doctrine of <HI>Original,</HI> or Birth Sin, Article the 9th.</P>
<P><Q>Original Sin &s;tandeth not in the follow|ing of <HI>Adam</HI> (as the <HI>Pelagians</HI> do vainly
<PB N="9" REF="9">
talk) but it is the Fault and Corruption of the Nature of every Man that is gendered of the Offspring of <HI>Adam,</HI> whereby Man is far gone from Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil.</Q></P>
<P>This the <HI>Pelagians</HI> of old denied, and this the modern <HI>Pelagians,</HI> who pretend to great Knowledge, while ignorant of them&s;elves, and Strangers to the Corruption and Depra|vity of their own Hearts, <HI>di&s;own.</HI> At the &s;ame Time they are &s;tanding Monuments of the Truth of this Doctrine, and whether they believe or confe&s;s it or not, their outward Actions plainly evince the inhering Power of Original Sin; their not &s;eeing, not knowing, and not feeling it, is only one of the &s;tronge&s;t Proofs of their being under original Blindne&s;s and In&s;en&s;ibility. And yet &s;uch as the&s;e truly, &s;et up for Guides and Teachers of others. Know them, Brethren: Di&s;cern them you may, you ought; and for your Soul's Sake avoid &s;uch. Attend not to their &s;weet Syrens Songs, le&s;t you are thereby lulled a&s;leep up|on the Waves of De&s;truction. Take the&s;e Marks with you. Your&s;elves, Brethren, judge of their Doctrines by them: For our Articles plainly declare the mi&s;erable State and Condition of Man, of every Man that is born into this World; Fir&s;t, in the Lo&s;s of original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the Image of God; and Secondly, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a contrary Image; therefore is of his own Nature in|clined
<PB N="10" REF="10">
to Evil. Here behold the true Pic|ture of the &s;o much boa&s;ted Dignity of human Nature! Thus is Man painted out by our Article, thus is Man de&s;cribed by the Oracles of Truth; and to this melancholy Account doth every true Chri&s;tian readily &s;ub&s;cribe, and every carnal, natural Man's Actions fully demon&s;trate it. Ay, but, &s;ay our <HI>new Doctors,</HI> and <HI>modern Teachers,</HI> this is too dark a Shade, too &s;able a Dre&s;s, too degrading of the hu|man Nature, and therefore they tickle the Ears, plea&s;e the Pride, and flatter the Vanity of the human Mind, with their <HI>unedifying Jargon, un&s;criptural Harangues,</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e Encomiums</HI> on the Moral Rectitude, Virtue, and Dignity of Man. But Brethren, would ye avoid an un&s;kilful <HI>Quack</HI> in Surgery, who in&s;tead of &s;earching and probing a Wound, in order to procure the Soundne&s;s and Health of the Body, &s;hould &s;lightly heal and &s;kin over the Parts aggrieved, while Putrefaction and Rottenne&s;s is at the Bottom, whereby the Life of the Patient is de&s;troyed? So the&s;e <HI>Quacks</HI> in Divinity are much more to be dreaded, ina&s;much as the Life of the Soul is of infinitely more Value than that of the Body. I have heard our true, &s;taunch, <HI>Church Mini&s;ters,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch Flatterers of human Nature by the Appellations of <HI>&s;leek Divines, downy Doctors,</HI> and <HI>velvet|mouthed Preachers.</HI> Pretty and &s;ignificant truly! And the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes &s;uch, as
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;erve not the Lord Je&s;us but their own Bellies, with fine Words and fair Speeches deceiving the Hearts of the Simple: For as they don't preach agreeable to the Articles, &s;o neither do they chu&s;e Scripture Language, nor A|po&s;tolic Diction, in their Compo&s;itions. For our Article next declares,</P>
<P><Q>Therefore in every Per&s;on born into the World, it de&s;erves <HI>God's Wrath and Dam|nation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What a &s;trange Phra&s;e is here, God's Wrath and Damnation. <Q>Ah, &s;ay our <HI>new|fangled Teachers,</HI> our flim&s;y Divines, thank God we are not &s;o uncharitable, to &s;up|po&s;e any Per&s;on in the World de&s;erving of God's Wrath and Damnation. What unpolite, uncouth Sett of Men were the Compilers of the&s;e Articles!</Q></P>
<P>Say ye &s;o? Pray let me ob&s;erve, That however unfa&s;hionable this Doctrine may be thought by &s;ome, however ob&s;olete and har&s;h, the Expre&s;&s;ions may &s;eem to others of our airy fa&s;hionable Preachers, Truth it is. It is the Doctrine of Scripture, and tho&s;e vener|able Compilers &s;pake as <HI>the Oracles of God.</HI> And is it not better, far better, for the Sin|ner to hear and be made &s;en&s;ible of his Dan|ger, and <HI>de&s;erving of God's Wrath and Dam|nation,</HI> &s;o as to e&s;cape it <HI>now,</HI> than to be blinded by flattering Deceivers, till he falls a Sacrifice to God's Wrath and Damnation,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
in dreadful Eternity hereafter? This you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to, this you will not deny?</P>
<P>But our Article farther declares, <Q>This Infection of Nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated.</Q> Regenerated, how? By Infant Bapti&s;m only? No, the Re|generate have received not the outward and vi&s;ible Sign only, but are made Partakers of the inward and &s;piritual Grace <HI>al&s;o.</HI> By the quickening and purifying Operations of the Holy Spirit, a Principle of &s;piritual Life is implanted in them (and take this by the Way, without experiencing this, Infant Bap|ti&s;m will not, cannot profit any Per&s;on to Salvation:) So that &s;uch, and &s;uch only, are &s;en&s;ible of the different <HI>lu&s;tings of the Fle&s;h and of the Spirit;</HI> and though there is no Condemnation for &s;uch as believe with a Faith of divine Operation, and are baptized with the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, <Q>yet Con|cupi&s;ence and Lu&s;t, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle (that is, inward De&s;ires and Lu&s;tings) hath the Nature of Sin.</Q></P>
<P>But alas! in the&s;e Days of Modification and Refinement, if &s;o be the outward Actions are &s;omewhat decent, moral, and regular, no Thought or Concern is taken about in|ward Depravity and Heart-Wickedne&s;s. But what amazing Horror, what trembling Dread, will &s;eize on &s;uch, when a Heart-&s;earching God &s;hall di&s;cover before Angels and Men the Vilene&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, and Deceitfulne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="13">
of the Heart, and to the &s;peechle&s;s Condem|nation of all mi&s;erable <HI>Dawbers</HI> and Soul-Deceivers, they &s;hall be forced to own (when too late to be rectified) that their inward Parts were very Wickedne&s;s, and therefore &s;tood in Need of being changed and renewed, as well as the outward Actions to be reformed and moralized.</P>
<P>And as the former Article &s;hews the Wretchedne&s;s and Sinfulne&s;s of our E&s;tate by Nature, the next Article (10) a&s;&s;erts the Helple&s;&s;ne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency of our Con|dition.</P>
<P><Q>The Condition of Man &s;ince the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> is &s;uch, that he cannot turn and pre|pare him&s;elf by his own natural Strength and good Works, to Faith and calling up|on God. Wherefore we have no Power to do good Works plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Chri&s;t preventing us, that we may have a good Will, and working with us when we have that good Will.</Q></P>
<P>Deceivers will come, &s;aith the Scripture; we believe it &s;aith our Church; and there|fore we e&s;tabli&s;h Articles, at once to &s;ettle the Judgment of our Members, and to guard them from erroneous Novelty. And are not the&s;e Deceivers already come? Is not their Name Legion? Do not <HI>Arminian</HI> Teachers &s;warm among us? Who teach, that Man has Free-Will and Power to turn and prepare
<PB N="14" REF="14">
him&s;elf, and to do good Works, by which he is to recommend him&s;elf to the Favour of God. Are not the&s;e the favourite Doctrines of this Day? Don't we con&s;tantly hear &s;uch Un&s;criptural, Antichri&s;tian Tenets daily ad|vanced, both from <HI>Pulpit and Pre&s;s?</HI> A&s;k that reverend Gentleman in <HI>Black,</HI> Sir, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved? And you will find his An|&s;wer as novel and as modi&s;h as the Fa&s;hion of his <HI>Periwig.</HI> He's too polite to dictate the old Scriptural An&s;wer, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> But <Q>practice Morality, and do good Works, and you are &s;afe.</Q> Was you to reply, Sir I have no Power to do good Works, plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, with|out the Grace of God by Chri&s;t&mdash;<Q>P&s;ha, p&s;ha, prithee don't tire and teaze me with your Methodi&s;tical Rant, and Enthu&s;ia&s;ti|cal Non&s;en&s;e,</Q> would be your An&s;wer from his <HI>Orthodox Reverend&s;hip.</HI> Man's Power, natural Ability, and Free-Will, are his favourite Themes, in&s;tead of free Grace, &s;upernatural Power, divine and &s;piritual A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Lord have Mercy on the Sheep that are under the Care of &s;uch a Shepherd!</P>
<P>But, Brethren, let me plainly and briefly apply my&s;elf to you on the two foregoing Articles. Do ye know your&s;elves? Are ye &s;en&s;ible of your real State? Are ye made ac|quainted with your true Condition? Do ye know and feel your Mi&s;ery and Want as Sin|ners? Are ye &s;en&s;ible of your own Weakne&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="15">
and In&s;ufficiency to turn and prepare your|&s;elves? Do you &s;ee your Inclination and Pronene&s;s to all Evil and Sin, and your A|ver&s;ion and Di&s;affection to all Holine&s;s and Godline&s;s? If you do not, have not thus &s;een your&s;elves &s;tript of all Good, and full of all Evil, <HI>de&s;erving God's Wrath and Damnation,</HI> it is plain you are blind even unto this Day, and farther, you never prayed in all your Life. Nay, don't &s;tart; 'tis plain Truth: You cannot, you dare not deny it before God, and your own Con&s;cience, if you con|&s;ider Prayer as a breathing out the Wants of the Soul before God, in and under a Sen&s;e of the &s;ame, and an humble Dependence on him, for Relief and Redre&s;s. But how could you pray to be delivered from Sin, Evil, and Danger, when you never &s;aw it, never felt it, and was never &s;en&s;ible of it, and con&s;e|quently could have no De&s;ire to be delivered from it?</P>
<P>But you &s;ay you have gone to Church, and prayed&mdash;that you have gone to Church, and repeated the &s;olemn Words of our excellent Liturgy, is not denied; but even then and there you offered the Sacrifice of Fools, and &s;olemnly mocked God, while you pretended to addre&s;s and wor&s;hip him. El&s;e how could you dare to tell God you was a <HI>mi&s;erable Sin|ner,</HI> de&s;ire him to have Mercy upon you, tell him there is <HI>no Health in you,</HI> that you are <HI>tied and bound with the Chain of your Sins,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="16">
and <HI>that the Remembrance of your Sins is grievous unto you, and the Burden is intoler|able,</HI> while you neither feel nor experience &s;uch a State? Surely the mo&s;t dreadful Hy|pocri&s;y this! The mo&s;t fatal and dangerous Delu&s;ion po&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>But if not only your Heads are enlighten|ed, and your Judgment informed, but your Hearts al&s;o truly convicted and humbled be|fore the Lord, with a View of your&s;elves as de&s;cribed by our Scripture Articles; ble&s;&s;ed Knowledge! Happy Sen&s;ibility! For this you are indebted to the Divine Grace, and Heavenly Teachings of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> of whom you learn to <Q>ca&s;t away all human Confidence, all Dependence on the Arm of Fe&s;h only, and to fly to Chri&s;t for Help and Succour&mdash;with a <HI>Lord &s;ave,</HI> or we peri&s;h; for the Heart of Man by Nature is e&s;tranged and alienated from <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> would try every other Means, and &s;eek for Salvation in any Way, rather than accept it as a <HI>free Gift</HI> from <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> To ca&s;t away all Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s is grievous to the Heart in its natural State of Pride, and Affectation of Independency. Man would &s;till be as God, &s;till work out and merit for him&s;elf his own Salvation: And he mu&s;t be driven to the la&s;t Extremity, &s;ee the In&s;ufficiency of Law and SELF, of <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> before he <HI>can</HI> ca&s;t away all <HI>other Confidence, and apply</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>

<P>O Brethren, what a Con&s;i&s;tency of Doc|trine! What a Harmony of Divine Truth! What a Chain of Scripture Tenets, do our excellent Articles afford us!

<P>You &s;ee Brethren, that good Works are the Fruits of Faith. Have you received of God the Gift of Faith? Faith in our Lord
<PB N="21" REF="21">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby you are ju&s;tified? Is the Condemnation and Guilt of your Sins taken away? And do ye po&s;&s;e&s;s Pardon and Peace from God? Then I am &s;ure you mu&s;t love God, and Love is the mo&s;t powerful and availing Principle to produce good Works, <Q REND="inline">"plea&s;ant and acceptable to God in Chri&s;t,"</Q> for only in Chri&s;t Je&s;us is it our Works are accepted; the be&s;t Work we can perform can't put away our Sins, and endure the Se|verity of God's Judgment: <Q>But good Works &s;pring out nece&s;&s;arily of a true Faith,</Q> they are true Marks and Evidences of a lively Faith, as the Fruitfulne&s;s of a Tree is an unan&s;werable Proof of the Life and Soundne&s;s of the Root. Hence ye &s;ee, Bre|thren, by the plain Sen&s;e of the Articles, that without a true ju&s;tifying Faith in our Lord Je&s;us, no good Works can be pro|duced; and yet truly we find many, who pretend to be the only true orthodox Teachers of our Church, con&s;tantly exploding and ve|hemently denying the Doctrine of Ju&s;tifica|tion by Faith only. Therefore it is a plain Con&s;equence and natural Deduction, that the only Marks &s;uch give of their <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> is, that they have neither <HI>Faith</HI> nor <HI>good Works,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all that prating and Noi&s;e they make about <HI>good Works.</HI> And this is more fully proved by Article 13, which a&s;|&s;ures us,</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">
All <Q>Works done before the Grace of Chri&s;t, and the In&s;piration of his Spirit, are not plea&s;ant to God, fora&s;much as they &s;pring not of Faith in Je&s;u Chri&s;t; neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors &s;ay) de&s;erve Grace of Congruity: Rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and com|manded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</Q></P>
<P>The Grace of Chri&s;t, and the In&s;piration of the Spirit! Why this is the very Mark and Characteri&s;tic of an <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> to talk of being in&s;pired, &s;ay our <HI>new Lights</HI> and <HI>mo|dern Deceivers.</HI> But no, it is the only Prin|ciple of true Chri&s;tian Practices. He is not a Chri&s;tian who is not in&s;pired by the Spirit of God, neither are any Works plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, but what &s;pring from In|&s;piration, &s;ays our Church. <HI>In&s;piration</HI> &s;ig|nifies a Breathing inward: What?

<P>But to avoid Prolixity, I &s;hall not enlarge, as I find I have much exceeded my fir&s;t In|tentions; but really our excellent Articles afford &s;uch a Field of Argument to &s;upport Truth, and detect Error, that they are plea|&s;ing and delightful Themes to dwell on, though I doubt not but what I have advanced

<P>So again that decent regular Per&s;on, who freed from the <HI>irk&s;ome Care of Souls,</HI> com|fortably lolls in his Chariot, thinks 'tis Time for him to have done with the Labour and Fatigue of praying and preaching (for he is turned of Forty) therefore has <HI>left off Trade,</HI> is content with a bare &s;ingle 1000l. <HI>per Annum</HI> Church Preferment; he loves, wi&s;hes well to the Church (not without Rea&s;on by the by) rails at your popular, Mob-driving Preachers (as he terms them) is &s;ure they would not take half the Pains they do, if Views of Money-getting were not at the Bot|tom: The&s;e &s;ort of Gentlemen too, &s;tand very clear of being deemed <HI>Methodi&s;ts.</HI></P>

<P>Well, it is plain that Principles and Prac|tices, &s;uch as are contrary to the ignorant, formal, &s;inful, Antichri&s;tian Mini&s;ters and Profe&s;&s;ors of the Age, and to abide by and contend for the orthodox Articles of our Church, is thought &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a Per&s;on a <HI>Methodi&s;t:</HI> Therefore, Reader, let me here pre&s;ent thee with a ju&s;t and plain

<P><Q>Ah, &s;ays a con&s;tant Church-goer, I heard one of the&s;e Preachers at our Church; he preached &s;uch a Sermon! almo&s;t an Hour long, and &s;aid downright, That all unconverted People were in a State of Damnation, and would go to Hell, if they did not believe on the Lord Je&s;us!

<P>Why truly Reader, &s;uch is the preaching of too many who call them&s;elves Mini&s;ters of our Church; but beware of them, for they are Heathens in Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>But your Ethu&s;ia&s;ts pretend to, and con|tend for, In&s;piration of the Spirit.</Q> A heavy Charge this indeed! And is this what you mean by <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m?</HI> Are all that pre|tend to be in&s;pired by the Spirit <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts?</HI> O yes, doubtle&s;s, &s;ay our modern Teachers, and unchri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors! Why then if &s;o, is not every Mini&s;ter of our Church an <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;t</HI> or a Deceiver? For they all at their Ordination, &s;olemnly profe&s;s to be inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to take on them the holy Function; and al&s;o the Bi&s;hop pro|nounces on them, Receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t. Hence 'tis plain our Church pre-requires the Nece&s;&s;ity of an inward Call and In&s;piration of the Spirit to the Work of the Mini&s;try, (which if they pretend to and have not, they are Deceivers) and therefore 'tis expected they receive the powerful Influences and Opera|tions of the Holy Gho&s;t, as though without
<PB N="29" REF="29">
them they could not be true Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And it has been be|fore proved, from the plain Declarations of our Articles, that without the In&s;piration of the Holy Spirit none can be a true Chri&s;tian, or do any good Works.</P>
<P>But if by an Enthu&s;ia&s;t is meant a De|ceiver, one that <HI>fancies</HI> him&s;elf and <HI>pretends</HI> to be what in Reality he is not: I declare to you Reader, I do not know a wor&s;e Sort of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, nor a more dangerous Sett of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and Deceivers, (Deceivers both of them&s;elves and others, let common Sen&s;e and right Rea&s;on determine the Point) than tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who &s;olemnly profe&s;s to be inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, pre|tend to receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit at their Ordination, a&s;&s;ent, &s;ub&s;cribe, and &s;wear to the Articles of our Church, in which the Nece&s;&s;ity of In&s;piration is &s;o &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on; u&s;e the mo&s;t excellent Form of our Church Liturgy; con&s;tantly pray to God for the In&s;piration, Guidance, and Operations of the Holy Spirit: And yet after all this (O dreadful Hypocri&s;y before God! O amazing Soul-Delu&s;ion!) can je&s;t, jeer at, and ridicule all &s;piritual Influences and inward Operations; de&s;pi&s;e and contemn the hone&s;t, faithful, &s;piritual Mini&s;ters of our Church. Surely an hone&s;t Heathen would blu&s;h at &s;uch Behaviour. No Won|der &s;uch are &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;et at
<PB N="30" REF="30">
nought, who make them&s;elves by their Ab|&s;urdity contemptible in the Sight of Men.</P>
<P>But it is farther urged again&s;t our truly re|verend and Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, <Q>That they are not content with the common and or|dinary Operations of the Spirit, but they talk of, and contend for, the extraordi|nary and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t; therefore they <HI>are Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></Q> This is fal&s;e; they neither expect, nor &s;ee any Nece&s;&s;ity for the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t: But they contend for (agree|able to Scripture) the promi&s;ed inward Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit, to enlighten, convince, convert, and make happy, the true Chri&s;tian, by his indwelling Witne&s;s and comfortable Pre&s;ence to the Soul.</P>
<P>Neither is their Preten&s;ions to In&s;piration <Q>ungrounded and unwarranted (as others object, and therefore &s;ay) they are <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></Q> This Kind of Preten&s;ion may be reduced to two Sorts for <HI>Matter,</HI> and for <HI>Manner.</HI> For Matter, when Per&s;ons pre|tend to In&s;piration of God for things con|trary to Scripture, which God hath given us as a &s;tanding Rule to the World's End. But our Mini&s;ters pretend to no &s;uch In&s;piration, &s;eeing they con&s;tantly inculcate the Doctrines of our Church, which are agreeable to the Scriptures: Yea, they preach &s;uch In&s;pira|tion <HI>only,</HI> which the Word of God promi&s;es to every true Chri&s;tian. Therefore they are not Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
For <HI>Manner,</HI> when In&s;pirations are ex|pected to exclude and &s;uper&s;ede the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, Scripture, and all Divine Ordinan|ces. Such as pretend to the&s;e are proper <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI> But our faithful and orthodox Mini&s;ters preach the rational Scripture Doc|trines of the Go&s;pel <HI>only.</HI> They don't &s;et up Heathen Morality in&s;tead of Chri&s;tian Prac|tices, nor do they teach Man's natural Abili|ty, to the Exclu&s;ion of God's Divine Grace, nor the Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;inful Man, in order to &s;uper&s;ede and &s;et at nought the meritorious Sacrifice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No; but they in&s;i&s;t on the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of being endued with &s;piritual Life and &s;piritual Power, in order to produce &s;piritual Actions; they &s;cripturally teach, that Faith, and every other good Gift and Grace, is of the Spirit's <HI>In&s;piration;</HI> and they therefore direct Souls to a diligent Atten|dance, and con&s;tant Waiting on the Ordi|nances, and to e&s;teem them as Channels, wherein God is u&s;ually plea&s;ed to <HI>in&s;pire</HI> in|to the Soul Divine Grace and &s;piritual Influ|ences.

<P>And now Reader, by &s;uch plain, &s;criptu|ral, and infallible Marks, we may know and di&s;cern the true Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters of our Church from <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ert and preach that true Chri&s;tianity is wrought in the Soul, by the Infu&s;ion and In&s;piration of the Spirit <HI>only,</HI> authorized by the Word

of God, and agreeable to the Voice of our Church, they con&s;tantly declare, No one can be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t without being called to and qualified for the preaching of the Go&s;pel, by the Spirit of Chri&s;t <HI>only.</HI> Neither can any Per&s;on be a true Chri&s;tian, but through the animating Power and A|gency of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.

<P>The Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit are promi&s;ed in the Go&s;pel to be with Chri&s;t's Church through all the &s;ucceeding Ages; to what End? But to carry on, and effectuate and apply, the Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts of Chri&s;t's Redemption to the Soul of every Member; to give them an Earne&s;t of the purcha&s;ed Inheritance in their Hearts <HI>here,</HI> and to qualify and prepare them for the En|joyment of the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us, in a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity hereafter?

Why really <HI>Mr. Par&s;on,</HI> Truth is a very de&s;irable thing, and never more &s;o, than when Reli|gion is concerned. Now the Ca&s;e is plainly
<PB N="34" REF="34">
this: When a Per&s;on is not content to take up his Religion upon Tru&s;t, but reads with Attention and Di&s;cernment the Word of God, compares the Doctrines of our Church with the Bible, and ob&s;erves the great and funda|mental Truths therein contained, either not preached at all in his <HI>own Pari&s;h Church,</HI> or what is wor&s;e, openly inveighed again&s;t, de|nied, and exploded. Such as the Doctrines of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> the In&s;ufficiency of Works to ju&s;tify the Sinner, the Merits and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us, and Ju&s;tification through the &s;ame by Faith; the Nece&s;&s;ity of inward Holine&s;s and Sanctification by the Holy Spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay, when a Per&s;on &s;ees the Weight and Importance of the&s;e &s;acred Scripture Truths, it is the very Delight of his Soul to hear them preached; he becomes a <HI>Church of England Man</HI> not by Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>merely,</HI> but on Principle <HI>chiefly.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis ea&s;y to be accounted for, that he takes &s;ome Pains to follow the Voice of the Church, and to attend the Sound of her Doc|trines at other Churches, and even thinks it an Unhappine&s;s he can't hear them preached at his own <HI>Pari&s;h Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Doctor</HI> you &s;ay 'tis wrong, and you blame People for rambling away from their own Churches; but is it not wor&s;e in you to for&s;ake your own Church Doctrines? 'Tis true, they &s;ometimes for&s;ake the Stone Walls and Buildings of their Pari&s;h Churches; but why? For this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e their
<PB N="35" REF="35">
own Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts have departed from the con&s;tituent Principles and e&s;tabli&s;hed Doc|trines of our Articles, Homilies, and Liturgy. And pray now, who is in Fault? Not tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who preach the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor tho&s;e who are &s;o at|tached to the &s;ame as to <HI>follow</HI> them; but tho&s;e who <HI>drive</HI> them away from their own &s;tated Pari&s;h Churches, by preaching con|trary to the venerable Scripture Truths, and can't be content with the Religion of their <HI>Forefathers,</HI> the Doctrines of the Reforma|tion, but mu&s;t broach &s;ome new-fangled Te|nets, and preach only the poor, dry, unavail|ing Sy&s;tem of Heatheni&s;h Morality, in&s;tead of the lively, animating, powerful, truly-moralizing Truths of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Therefore let <HI>Clericus</HI> and his Brethren, who are &s;o often haranguing <HI>again&s;t Schi&s;m</HI> and Separation, know that the <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> rever|berates and the Charge of Separation recoils back upon them&s;elves, while they are guilty of Schi&s;m in Doctrine, and &s;eparate from the precious Truths, the avowed Tenets of our excellent E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>But there is one Expedient, which from my hearty Zeal for our Church, and warm Affection to the Clergy, I would humbly re|commend to them (and may the Almighty God, who alone worketh <HI>great Marvels,</HI> in|cline them all to put it in Practice.) It is this, to preach con&s;tantly, maintain &s;teadily, in|culcate fervently, the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrines of
<PB N="36" REF="36" MS="y">
our Church, the glorious Truths of the Re|formation. Now who would think there could be any Objection again&s;t this Method? Nay there can be none; and I am &s;ure it will be practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who have &s;o much Con&s;cience, as to believe &s;olemn Promi&s;es, Oaths, and Sub&s;criptions, are binding and obligatory upon them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, con&s;ider Reverend Sirs, pray con&s;ider that be&s;ides di&s;charging your Con|&s;cience in the Sight of God, clearing your|&s;elves from the Imputation of Schi&s;m and Di&s;affection to the Truths of our E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, you may al&s;o a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves the&s;e happy Effects will be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Practice: Your re&s;pective Flocks will be kept together, they will punctually attend their Mini&s;ters at their own Pari&s;h Churches, ignorant Profe&s;&s;ors will be in&s;tructed in the &s;aving Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> and will be thereby pre&s;erved from being mi&s;led by Er|ror, and perverted by Delu&s;ion; a glorious Spirit of Reformation will over&s;pread our Land, the Practice of Morality and good Works will abound, and our Church will &s;oon become the Glory of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>O happy Period! A Time how much to be de&s;ired! May the God of Truth and Power ha&s;ten it for his Mercy's Sake!</P>
