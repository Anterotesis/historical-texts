<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ermon which gave ri&s;e to the publication of the&s;e, having been offer'd to the world as a &s;ermon of <HI>Yo|rick</HI>'s, I hope the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous reader will find nothing to offend him, in my conti|nuing the&s;e two volumes under the &s;ame title: le&s;t it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, I have added a &s;econd title page with the real
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
name of the author: &mdash; the fir&s;t will &s;erve the book&s;eller's purpo&s;e, as <HI>Yorick</HI>'s name is po&s;|&s;ibly of the two the more known; &mdash; and the &s;econd will ea&s;e the minds of tho&s;e who &s;ee a je&s;t, and the dan|ger which lurks under it, where no je&s;t was meant.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it is needle&s;s to inform the publick, that the rea&s;on of printing the&s;e &s;er|mons, ari&s;es altogether from
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
the favourable reception, which the &s;ermon given as a &s;ample of them in TRISTRAM SHANDY, met with from the world; &mdash; That &s;ermon was printed by it&s;elf &s;ome years ago, but could find neither purcha&s;ers or readers, &s;o that I appre|hended little hazard from a promi&s;e I made upon its re|publication,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if the &s;ermon was liked, the&s;e &s;hould be al&s;o at the world's &s;ervice;"</Q> which, to be as
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
good as my word, they here are, and I pray to GOD, they may do the &s;ervice I wi&s;h it.
I have little to &s;ay in their be|half, except this, that not one of them was compo&s;ed with any thoughts of being prin|ted, &mdash; they have been ha&s;tily wrote, and carry the marks of it along with them. &mdash; This may be no recommendation; &mdash; I mean it however as &s;uch; for as the &s;ermons turn chiefly upon philanthropy, and tho&s;e
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
kindred virtues to it, upon which hang all the law and the prophets, I tru&s;t they will be no le&s;s felt, or wor&s;e received, for the evidence they bear, of proceeding more from the heart than the head. I have nothing to add, but that the reader, upon old and beaten &s;ubjects, mu&s;t not look for many new thoughts, &mdash; 'tis well if he has new lan|guage; in three or four pa&s;|&s;ages, where he has neither
<PB N="x" REF="12">
the one or the other, I have quoted the author I made free with &mdash; there are &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages, where I &s;u&s;pect I may have taken the &s;ame li|berty, &mdash; but 'tis only &s;u&s;pi|cion, for I do not remember it is &s;o, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have re&s;tored them to their proper owners, &s;o that I put it in here more as a general &s;aving, than from a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of having much to an&s;wer for upon that &s;core:
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
in this however, and every thing el&s;e, which I offer, or &s;hall offer to the world, I re&s;t, with a heart much at ea&s;e, upon the protection of the humane and candid, from whom I have received many favours, for which I beg leave to return them thanks &mdash; thanks.</P>

<P>There be many that &s;ay, who will &s;hew us any good? &mdash; Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great pur&s;uit of man is after happine&s;s: it is the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of his na|ture &mdash; in every &s;tage of his life, he &s;earches for it, as for hid trea&s;ure &mdash; courts it under a thou&s;and different &s;hapes &mdash; and though perpetually di&s;appointed, &mdash; &s;till per&s;i&s;ts &mdash; runs after and enquires for it afre&s;h &mdash; a&s;ks every pa&s;&s;enger who comes in his way &mdash; Who will &s;hew him any good? &mdash; who will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the attainment of it, or direct him to the
<PB N="2" REF="40">
di&s;covery of this great end of all his wi&s;hes?</P>
<P>He is told by one, to &s;earch for it among&s;t the more gay and youthful plea|&s;ures of life, in &s;cenes of mirth and &s;prightline&s;s where happine&s;s ever pre|&s;ides, and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will &s;ee, at once painted in her looks.</P>
<P>A &s;econd, with a graver a&s;pect, points out to the co&s;tly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected &mdash; tells the enquirer that the object he is in &s;earch of inhabits there &mdash; that happine&s;s lives only in company with the great in the mid&s;t of much pomp and outward &s;tate. That he will ea&s;ily find her out by the coat of many colours &s;he has on, and the great luxury and expence of equipage
<PB N="3" REF="41">
and furniture with which &s;he always &s;its &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>The mi&s;er ble&s;&s;es GOD! &mdash; wonders how any one would mi&s;lead, and wilfully put him upon &s;o wrong a &s;cent &mdash; con|vinces him that happine&s;s and extrava|gance never inhabited under the &s;ame roof &mdash; that if he would not be di&s;ap|pointed in his &s;earch, he mu&s;t look into the plain and thrifty dwelling of the pru|dent man, who knows and under&s;tands the worth of money, and cautiou&s;ly lays it up again&s;t an evil hour: that it is not the pro&s;titution of wealth upon the pa&s;|&s;ions, or the parting with it at all, that con&s;titutes happine&s;s &mdash; but that it is the keeping it together, and the <HI>having</HI> and <HI>holding</HI> it fa&s;t to their heirs for ever which are the chief attributes that form this
<PB N="4" REF="42">
great idol of human wor&s;hip to which &s;o much incen&s;e is offered up every day.</P>
<P>The epicure, though he ea&s;ily rectifies &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;take, yet at the &s;ame time he plunges him, if po&s;&s;ible, into a greater; for, hearing the object of his pur&s;uit to be happine&s;s, and knowing of no other happine&s;s than what is &s;eated immedi|ately in the &s;en&s;es &mdash; He &s;ends the enqui|rer there &mdash; tells him 'tis in vain to &s;earch el&s;ewhere for it, than where nature her|&s;elf has placed it &mdash; in the indulgence and gratification of the appetites which are given us for that end: and in a word &mdash; if he will not take his opinion in the matter &mdash; he may tru&s;t the word of a much wi&s;er man who has a&s;&s;ured us &mdash; that there is nothing better in this world, than that a man &s;hould eat and drink and rejoice in his works, and make his &s;oul
<PB N="5" REF="43">
enjoy good in his labour &mdash; for that is his portion.</P>
<P>To re&s;cue him from this brutal expe|riment &mdash; ambition takes him by the hand and carries him into the world &mdash; &s;hews him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them &mdash; points out the many ways of advancing his fortune and rai|&s;ing him&s;elf to honour &mdash; lays before his eyes all the charms and bewitching temptations of power, and a&s;ks if there can be any happine&s;s in this world like that of being care&s;&s;ed, courted, flattered and followed?</P>
<P>To clo&s;e all, the philo&s;opher meets him bu&s;tling in the full career of this pur&s;uit &mdash; &s;tops him &mdash; tells him, if he is in &s;earch of happine&s;s, he is far gone out of his way.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="44">That this deity has long been bani&s;hed from noi&s;e and tumults, where there was no re&s;t found for her, and was fled into &s;olitude far from all commerce of the world; and in a word, if he would find her, he mu&s;t leave this bu&s;y and intri|guing &s;cene, and go back to that peaceful &s;cene of retirement and books, from which he at fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>

For tho' there can be no happine&s;s without plea&s;ure &mdash; yet the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition will not hold true. &mdash; We are &s;o made, that from the common gratifications of our appetites, and the impre&s;&s;ions of a thou&s;and objects, we &s;natch the one, like a tran&s;ient gleam, without being &s;uffered to ta&s;te the other,

and enjoy that perpetual &s;un-&s;hine and fair weather which con&s;tantly attend it. This, I contend, is only to be found in religion &mdash; in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue &mdash; and the &s;ure and certain hopes of a better life, which brightens all our pro|&s;pects, and leaves no room to dread di&s;|appointments &mdash; becau&s;e the expectation of it is built upon a rock, who&s;e founda|tions are as deep as tho&s;e of heaven and hell.</P>
<P>And tho' in our pilgrimage through this world &mdash; &s;ome of us may be &s;o for|tunate as to meet with &s;ome clear foun|tains by the way, that may cool for a few moments, the heat of this great thir&s;t of happine&s;s &mdash; yet our Saviour, who knew the world, tho' he enjoyed but little of it, tells us, that who&s;oever drinketh of this water will thir&s;t again:

 &mdash; and we all find by experience it is &s;o, and by rea&s;on that it always mu&s;t be &s;o.</P>
<P>I conclude with a &s;hort ob&s;ervation upon Solomon's evidence in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Never did the bu&s;y brain of a lean and hectick chymi&s;t &s;earch for the phi|lo&s;opher's &s;tone with more pains and ar|dour than this great man did after hap|pine&s;s. &mdash; He was one of the wi&s;e&s;t en|quirers into nature &mdash; had tried all her powers and capacities, and after a thou|&s;and vain &s;peculations and vile experi|ments, he affirmed at length, it lay hid in no one thing he had tried &mdash; like the chymick's projections, all had ended in &s;moak, or what was wor&s;e, in vanity and vexation of &s;pirit: &mdash; the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter was this &mdash; that he ad|vi&s;es every man who would be happy, to fear GOD and keep his commandments.</P>

<P>I will not contend at pre&s;ent again&s;t this rhetorick; I would choo&s;e rather for a moment to go on with the allegory, and &s;ay we are travellers, and, in the mo&s;t

affecting &s;en&s;e of that idea, that like travellers, though upon bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t and neare&s;t concern to us, may &s;urely be allowed to amu&s;e our&s;elves with the natural or artificial beauties of the coun|try we are pa&s;&s;ing through, without re|proach of forgetting the main errand we are &s;ent upon; and if we can &s;o order it, as not to be led out of the way, by the variety of pro&s;pects, edifices, and ruins which &s;ollicit us, it would be a non&s;en&s;ical piece of &s;aint errantry to &s;hut our eyes.</P>
<P>But let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of the argu|ment in pur&s;uit of the &s;imile.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="67">
we ha&s;ten, and that the way to get there is not &s;o much to plea&s;e our hearts, as to improve them in virtue; &mdash; that mirth and fea&s;ting are u&s;ually no friends to at|chievements of this kind &mdash; but that a &s;ea&s;on of affliction is in &s;ome &s;ort a &s;ea&s;on of piety &mdash; not only becau&s;e our &s;ufferings are apt to put us in mind of our &s;ins, but that by the check and in|terruption which they give to our pur|&s;uits, they allow us what the hurry and bu&s;tle of the world too often deny us, &mdash; and that is a little time for reflection, which is all that mo&s;t of us want to make us wi&s;er and better men; &mdash; that at certain times it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a man's mind &s;hould be turned towards it&s;elf, that rather than want occa&s;ions, he had bet|ter purcha&s;e them at the expence of his pre&s;ent happine&s;s. &mdash; He had better, as the text expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>go to the hou&s;e of mourning,</HI> where he will meet with &s;ome|thing

to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, than to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting, where the joy and gaity of the place is likely to excite them &mdash; That whereas the entertainments and ca|re&s;&s;es of the one place, expo&s;e his heart and lay it open to temptations &mdash; the &s;or|rows of the other defend it, and as na|turally &s;hut them from it.

<P>And fir&s;t, let us look into the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting.</P>
<P>And here, to be as fair and candid as po&s;&s;ible in the de&s;cription of this, we will not take it from the wor&s;t originals, &s;uch as are opened merely for the &s;ale of virtue, and &s;o calculated for the end, that the di&s;gui&s;e each is under not only

<P>Imagine then, &s;uch a hou&s;e of fea&s;t|ing, where either by con&s;ent or invita|tion a number of each &s;ex is drawn toge|ther for no other purpo&s;e but the enjoy|ment and mutual entertainment of each other, which we will &s;uppo&s;e &s;hall ari&s;e

<P>Here then, let us turn a&s;ide, from this gay &s;cene; and &s;uffer me to take you
<PB N="40" REF="79">
with me for a moment to one much fitter for your meditation. Let us go into the hou&s;e of mourning, made &s;o, by &s;uch afflic|tions as have been brought in, merely by the common cro&s;s accidents and di&s;a&s;ters to which our condition is expo&s;ed, &mdash; where perhaps, the aged parents &s;it broken hearted, pierced to their &s;ouls with the folly and indi&s;cretion of a thankle&s;s child &mdash; the child of their prayers, in whom all their hopes and expectations centred: &mdash; perhaps a more affecting &s;cene &mdash; a virtuous family lying pinched with want, where the unfortunate &s;upport of it, ha|ving long &s;truggled with a train of mis|fortunes, and bravely fought up again&s;t them &mdash; is now piteou&s;ly borne down at the la&s;t &mdash; overwhelmed with a cruel blow which no foreca&s;t or frugality could have prevented. &mdash; O GOD! look upon his afflictions. &mdash; Behold him di&s;tracted

<P>When we enter into the hou&s;e of mourning &s;uch as this, &mdash; it is impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;ult the unfortunate even with an improper look &mdash; under whatever levity and di&s;&s;ipation of heart. Such objects catch our eyes, &mdash; they catch likewi&s;e our attentions, collect and call home our &s;cattered thoughts, and exerci&s;e them with wi&s;dom. A tran&s;ient &s;cene of di|&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as is here &s;ketch'd, how &s;oon does it furni&s;h materials to &s;et the mind at work? how nece&s;&s;arily does it engage it to the con&s;ideration of the mi&s;eries and misfortunes, the dangers and cala|mities to which the life of man is &s;ubject.
<PB N="42" REF="81">
By holding up &s;uch a gla&s;s before it, it forces the mind to &s;ee and reflect upon the vanity, &mdash; the peri&s;hing condition and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world.

<P>If the&s;e le&s;&s;ons are &s;o in&s;eparable from the hou&s;e of mourning here &s;uppo&s;ed &mdash; we &s;hall find it a &s;till more in&s;tructive &s;chool of wi&s;dom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light

in which the wi&s;e man &s;eems to confine it in the text, in which, by the hou&s;e of mourning, I believe, he means that par|ticular &s;cene of &s;orrow where there is la|mentation and mourning for the dead.</P>
<P>Turn in hither, I be&s;eech you, for a moment. Behold a dead man ready to be carried out, the only &s;on of his mo|ther, and &s;he a widow.

perform that la&s;t melancholy office, which when the debt of nature is payed, we are called upon to pay each other.</P>
<P>If this &s;ad occa&s;ion which leads him there, has not done it already, take no|tice, to what a &s;erious and devout frame of mind every man is reduced, the mo|ment he enters this gate of affliction.

is &s;mitten with &s;en&s;e and with a love of virtue.

<Q><BIBL>LUKE x. 36, 37.</BIBL>
<P>Which now of the&s;e three, thinke&s;t thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among&s;t the thieves? &mdash; And he &s;aid, he that &s;hewed mercy on him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him &mdash; Go, and do thou likewi&s;e.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the foregoing ver&s;es of this chap|ter, the Evangeli&s;t relates, that a certain lawyer &s;tood up and tempted JE|SUS, &s;aying, ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I do to inherit eternal life? &mdash; To which en|quiry, our SAVIOUR, as his manner was, when any en&s;naring que&s;tion was put to
<PB N="50" REF="90">
him, which he &s;aw proceeded more from a de&s;ign to entangle him, than an hone&s;t view of getting information &mdash; in&s;tead of giving a direct an&s;wer which might afford a handle to malice, or at be&s;t &s;erve only to gratify an impertinent humour &mdash; he immediately retorts the que&s;tion up|on the man who a&s;ked it, and unavoid|ably puts him upon the nece&s;&s;ity of an|&s;wering him&s;elf; &mdash; and as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the particular profe&s;&s;ion of the en|quirer, and his &s;uppo&s;ed general know|ledge of all other branches of learning, left no room to &s;u&s;pect, he could be ig|norant of the true an&s;wer to his que&s;|tion, and e&s;pecially of what every one knew was delivered upon that head by their great Legi&s;lator, our SAVIOUR therefore refers him to his own memory of what he had found there in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies &mdash; What is written in the
<PB N="51" REF="91">
law, how reade&s;t thou? &mdash; upon which the enquirer reciting the general heads of our duty to GOD and MAN as deli|vered in the 18th of Leviticus and the 6th of Deuteronomy, &mdash; namely &mdash; <HI>That we &s;hould wor&s;hip the Lord our God with all our hearts, and love our neighbour as our&s;elves</HI>; our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR tells him, he had an&s;wered right, and if he follow|ed that le&s;&s;on, he could not fail of the ble&s;&s;ing he &s;eemed de&s;irous to inherit. &mdash; <HI>This do and thou &s;halt live.</HI></P>
<P>But he, as the context tell us, willing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf &mdash; willing po&s;&s;ibly to gain more credit in the conference, or hoping perhaps to hear &s;uch a partial and narrow definition of the word <HI>neighbour</HI> as would &s;uit his own princi|ples, and ju&s;tify &s;ome particular oppre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="52" REF="92">
of his own, or tho&s;e of which his whole order lay under an accu&s;ation &mdash; &s;ays unto JESUS in the 29th ver&s;e, &mdash; <HI>And who is my neighbour?</HI> though the demand at fir&s;t &s;ight may &s;eem utterly trifling, yet was it far from being &s;o in fact. For according as you under&s;tood the term in a more or a le&s;s re&s;trained &s;en&s;e &mdash; it produced many nece&s;&s;ary variations in the duties you owed from that rela|tion. &mdash; Our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, to rectify any partial and pernicious mi&s;take in this matter, and place at once this duty of the love of our neighbour upon its true bottom of philanthropy and univer&s;al kindne&s;s, makes an&s;wer to the propo&s;ed que&s;tion, not by any far fetch'd refine|ment from the &s;chools of the Rabbis, which might have &s;ooner &s;ilenced than convinced the man &mdash; but by a direct
<PB N="53" REF="93">
appeal to human nature in an in&s;tance he relates of a man falling among&s;t thieves, left in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s imaginable, till by chance a Samaritan, an utter &s;tranger, coming where he was, by an act of great goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, not only relieved him at pre&s;ent, but took him under his protection, and ge|nerou&s;ly provided for his future &s;afety.</P>
<P>On the clo&s;e of which engaging ac|count &mdash; our SAVIOUR appeals to the man's own heart in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the text &mdash; <HI>Which now of the&s;e three thinke&s;t thou was neighbour unto him that fell among&s;t the thieves?</HI> and in&s;tead of draw|ing the inference him&s;elf, leaves him to decide in favour of &s;o noble a principle &s;o evidently founded in mercy. &mdash; The lawyer, &s;truck with the truth and ju&s;tice of the doctrine, and frankly acknowledg|ing
<PB N="54" REF="94">
the force of it, our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR concludes the debate with a &s;hort admo|nition, that he would practi&s;e what he had approved &mdash; and go, and imitate that fair example of univer&s;al benevolence which it had &s;et before him.</P>
<P>In the remaining part of the di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall follow the &s;ame plan; and there|fore &s;hall beg leave to enlarge fir&s;t upon the &s;tory it&s;elf, with &s;uch reflections as will ri&s;e from it; and conclude, as our SAVIOUR has done, with the &s;ame exhor|tation to kindne&s;s and humanity which &s;o naturally falls from it.</P>
<P>A certain man, &s;ays our SAVIOUR, went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho and fell among thieves, who &s;tripped him of his rayment and departed, leaving him half dead. There is &s;omething in our
<PB N="55" REF="95">
nature which engages us to take part in every accident to which man is &s;ub|ject, from what cau&s;e &s;oever it may have happened; but in &s;uch calamities as a man has fallen into through mere mis|fortune, to be charged upon no fault or indi&s;cretion of him&s;elf, there is &s;ome|thing then &s;o truly intere&s;ting, that at the fir&s;t &s;ight we generally make them our own, not altogether from a reflec|tion that they might have been or may be &s;o, but oftener from a certain genero|&s;ity and tenderne&s;s of nature which di&s;|po&s;es us for compa&s;&s;ion, ab&s;tracted from all con&s;iderations of &s;elf. So that with|out any ob&s;ervable act of the will, we &s;uffer with the unfortunate, and feel a weight upon our &s;pirits we know not why, on &s;eeing the mo&s;t common in&s;tan|ces of their di&s;tre&s;s. But where the &s;pec|tacle is uncommonly tragical, and com|plicated
<PB N="56" REF="96">
with many circum&s;tances of mi|&s;ery, the mind is then taken captive at once, and, <HI>were</HI> it inclined to it, has no power to make re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;urrenders it&s;elf to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern. So that when one con&s;iders this friendly part of our nature without looking farther, one would think it impo&s;&s;ible for man to look upon mi|&s;ery, without finding him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure attached to the intere&s;t of him who &s;uffers it. &mdash; I &s;ay, one would think it impo&s;&s;ible &mdash; for there are &s;ome tem|pers &mdash; how &s;hall I de&s;cribe them? &mdash; formed either of &s;uch impenetrable mat|ter, or wrought up by habitual &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s to &s;uch an utter in&s;en&s;ibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow-creatures, as if they were not partakers of the &s;ame nature, or had no lot or con|nection at all with the &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="97">Of this character, our SAVIOUR pro|duces two di&s;graceful in&s;tances in the be|haviour of a prie&s;t and a levite, whom in this account he repre&s;ents as coming to the place where the unhappy man was &mdash; both pa&s;&s;ing by without either &s;tretch|ing forth a hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or uttering a word to comfort him in his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And by chance there came down a certain prie&s;t! &mdash; merciful GOD! that a teacher of thy religion &s;hould ever want humanity &mdash; or that a man who&s;e head might be thought full of the one, &s;hould have a heart void of the other! &mdash; This however was the ca&s;e before us &mdash; and though in theory one would &s;carce &s;u&s;|pect that the lea&s;t pretence to religion and an open di&s;regard to &s;o main a part of it, could ever meet together in one
<PB N="58" REF="98">
per&s;on &mdash; yet in fact it is no fictitious character.</P>
<P>Look into the world &mdash; how often do you behold a &s;ordid wretch, who&s;e &s;traight heart is open to no man's affliction, ta|king &s;helter behind an appearance of piety, and putting on the garb of reli|gion, which none but the merciful and compa&s;&s;ionate have a title to wear. Take notice with what &s;anctity he goes to the end of his days, in the &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h track in which he at fir&s;t &s;et out &mdash; turn|ing neither to the right hand nor to the left &mdash; but plods on &mdash; pores all his life long upon the ground, as if afraid to look up, le&s;t peradventure he &s;hould &s;ee aught which might turn him one moment out of that &s;traight line where intere&s;t is carrying him &mdash; or if, by chance, he &s;tumbles upon a haple&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="99">
object of di&s;tre&s;s, which threatens &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter to him &mdash; like the man here repre&s;ented, <HI>devoutly</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by on the other &s;ide, as if unwilling to tru&s;t him|&s;elf to the impre&s;&s;ions of nature, or hazard the inconveniences which pity might lead him into upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is but one &s;troke wanting in this picture of an unmerciful man to ren|der the character utterly odious, and that our SAVIOUR gives it in the following in&s;tance he relates upon it. And like|wi&s;e, &s;ays he, <HI>a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked at him.</HI> It was not a tran&s;ient over&s;ight, the ha&s;ty or ill advi&s;ed neglect of an uncon&s;idering hu|mour, with which the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed are &s;ometimes overtaken, and led on beyond the point where otherwi&s;e they would have wi&s;hed to &s;top. &mdash; No! &mdash; on the
<PB N="60" REF="100">
contrary, it had all the aggravation of a deliberate act of in&s;en&s;ibility proceeding from a hard heart. When he was at the place, he came, and looked at him &mdash; con&s;idered his misfortunes, gave time for rea&s;on and nature to have awoke &mdash; &s;aw the imminent danger he was in &mdash; and the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of immediate help, which &s;o violent a ca&s;e called aloud for &mdash; and after all &mdash; turned a&s;ide and un|mercifully left him to all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his condition.</P>
<P>In all unmerciful actions, the wor&s;t of men pay this compliment at lea&s;t to hu|manity, as to endeavour to wear as much of the appearance of it, as the ca&s;e will well let them &mdash; &s;o that in the harde&s;t acts a man &s;hall be guilty of, he has &s;ome motives true or fal&s;e always ready to offer, either to &s;atisfy him&s;elf or the
<PB N="61" REF="101">
world, and, GOD knows, too often to impo&s;e both upon the one and the other. And therefore it would be no hard mat|ter here to give a probable gue&s;s at what pa&s;&s;ed in the Levite's mind in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, and &s;hew, was it nece&s;&s;ary, by what kind of ca&s;ui&s;try he &s;ettled the matter with his con&s;cience as he pa&s;&s;ed by, and guarded all the pa&s;&s;ages to his heart again&s;t the inroads which pity might attempt to make upon the occa|&s;ion. &mdash; But it is painful to dwell long upon this di&s;agreeable part of the &s;tory; I therefore ha&s;ten to the concluding inci|dent of it, which is &s;o amiable that one cannot ea&s;ily be too copious in reflections upon it. &mdash; And behold, &s;ays our SAVI|OUR, a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was; and when he &s;aw him he had compa&s;&s;ion on him &mdash; and went to him &mdash; bound up his wounds,
<PB N="62" REF="102">
pouring in oil and wine &mdash; &s;et him upon his own bea&s;t, brought him to an inn and took care of him. I &s;uppo&s;e, it will be &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary here to remind you that the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans &mdash; an old religious grudge &mdash; the wor&s;t of all grudges, had wrought &s;uch a di&s;like between both people, that they held them&s;elves mutually di&s;charged not only from all offices of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s, but even from the mo&s;t common acts of courte&s;y and good manners.

<P>We are &s;till wor&s;e ca&s;ui&s;ts, and the deceit is proportionably &s;tronger with a man, when he is going to judge of him|&s;elf &mdash; that deare&s;t of all parties, &mdash; &s;o clo&s;ely connected with him &mdash; &s;o much and &s;o long beloved &mdash; of whom he has &s;o early conceived the highe&s;t opinion and e&s;teem, and with who&s;e merit he has all-along, no doubt, found &s;o much rea&s;on to be contented.

<P>So that however ea&s;y this knowledge of one's-&s;elf may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, it is otherwi&s;e when we come to examine; &s;ince not only in practice but even in &s;peculation and theory, we find it one of the harde&s;t and mo&s;t painful le&s;&s;ons. Some of the earlie&s;t in&s;tructors of man|kind, no doubt, found it &s;o too, and for that rea&s;on, &s;oon &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of laying &s;uch a &s;tre&s;s upon this great pre|cept of &s;elf knowledge, which for its excellent wi&s;dom and u&s;efulne&s;s, many of them &s;uppo&s;ed to be a divine direc|tion; that it came down from Heaven, and comprehended the whole circle both

of knowledge and the duty of man. And indeed their zeal might ea&s;ily be allowed in &s;o high an encomium upon the attain|ment of a virtue, the want of which &s;o often baffled their in&s;tructions, and ren|dered their endeavours of reforming the heart vain and u&s;ele&s;s.

<P>But this was a point always much ea|&s;ier recommended by public in&s;tructors than &s;hewn how to be put in practice, and therefore others, who equally &s;ought the reformation of mankind, ob&s;erving that this direct road which led to it was guarded on all &s;ides by &s;elf-love, and con&s;equently very difficult of open ac|ce&s;s,
<PB N="86" REF="124">
&s;oon found out that a different and more artful cour&s;e was requi&s;ite; as they had not &s;trength to remove this flatter|ing pa&s;&s;ion which &s;tood in their way and blocked up all the pa&s;&s;ages to the heart, they endeavoured by &s;tratagem to get beyond it, and by a &s;kilful addre&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, to deceive it.

<P>The prophet Nathan &s;eems to have been a great ma&s;ter in this way of ad|dre&s;s. David had greatly di&s;plea&s;ed GOD by two grievous &s;ins which he had com|mitted, and the prophet's commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="87" REF="125">
was to go and bring him to a convic|tion of them, and touch his heart with a &s;en&s;e of guilt for what he had done again&s;t the honour and life of Uriah.</P>
<P>The holy man knew, that was it any one's ca&s;e but David's own, no man would have been &s;o quick-&s;ighted in di&s;|cerning the nature of the injury, &mdash; more ready to have redre&s;&s;ed it, or who would have felt more compa&s;&s;ion for the party who had &s;uffered it, than he him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of declaring the real intention of his errand, by a direct ac|cu&s;ation and reproof for the crimes he had committed; he comes to him with a fictitious complaint of a cruel act of inju&s;tice done by another, and accord|ingly he frames a ca&s;e, not &s;o parallel

to David's as he &s;uppo&s;ed would awaken his &s;u&s;picion, and prevent a patient and candid hearing, and yet not &s;o void of re&s;emblance in the main circum&s;tances, as to fail of &s;triking him, when &s;hewn in a proper light.</P>
<P>And Nathan came and &s;aid unto him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor &mdash; the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing, &s;ave one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nouri&s;hed up &mdash; and it grew up together with him and with his children &mdash; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bo&s;om, and was unto him as a daughter &mdash; and there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he &s;pared to take of his own flock and of his own

<P>The &s;tory, though it &s;poke only of the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ive act of an|other man &mdash; yet it pointed to what he had lately done him&s;elf, with all the circum&s;tances of its aggravation &mdash; and
<PB N="90" REF="128">
withal, the whole was &s;o tenderly ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the heart and pa&s;&s;ions, as to kindle at once the utmo&s;t horror and in|dignation. And &s;o it did, &mdash; but not again&s;t the proper per&s;on. In his tran&s;|port he forgot him&s;elf &mdash; his anger greatly kindled again&s;t the man &mdash; and he &s;aid unto Nathan,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing, &s;hall &s;urely die, and he &s;hall re&s;tore the lamb fourfold, becau&s;e he did this thing and becau&s;e he had no pity."</Q></P>
<P>It can &s;carce be doubted here, but that David's anger was <HI>real,</HI> and that he was what he appeared to be, greatly provoked and exa&s;perated again&s;t the offender: and, indeed, his &s;entence again&s;t him proves he was &s;o above mea&s;ure. For to puni&s;h the man with death, and
<PB N="91" REF="129">
oblige him to re&s;tore fourfold be&s;ides, was highly unequitable, and not only di&s;proportioned to the offence, but far above the utmo&s;t rigour and &s;everity of the law, which allowed a much &s;ofter attonement, requiring in &s;uch a ca&s;e, no more than an ample re&s;titution and re|compence in kind. The judgment how|ever, &s;eems to have been truly &s;incere and well meant, and be&s;poke rather the hone&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s of an un&s;u&s;picious judge, than the cool determination of a con|&s;cious and guilty man, who knew he was going to pa&s;s &s;entence upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I take notice of this particular, be|cau&s;e it places this in&s;tance of &s;elf deceit, which is the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e, in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and fully demon&s;trates the truth of a fact in this great man, which happens every day among&s;t our|&s;elves,

<P>And the barrel of meal wa&s;ted not, neither did the cru&s;e of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord which he &s;pake by the prophet Elijah.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words of the text are the re|cord of a miracle wrought in be|half of the widow of Zerephath, who had charitably taken Elijah under her roof, and admini&s;tered unto him in a time of great &s;carcity and di&s;tre&s;s. There is &s;omething very intere&s;ting and affec|tionate in the manner this &s;tory is re|lated in holy writ; and as it concludes with a &s;econd &s;till more remarkable
<PB N="114" REF="149">
proof of GOD's favour to the &s;ame per|&s;on, in the re&s;toration of her dead &s;on to life, one cannot but con&s;ider both mi|racles as rewards of that act of piety, wrought by infinite power, and left upon record in &s;cripture, not merely as te&s;ti|monies of the prophet's divine mi&s;&s;ion, but likewi&s;e as two encouraging in&s;tances of GOD Almighty's ble&s;&s;ing upon works of charity and benevolence.</P>
<P>In this view I have made choice of this piece of &s;acred &s;tory, which I &s;hall beg leave to make u&s;e of as the ground|work for an exhortation to charity in general: and that it may better an&s;wer the particular purpo&s;e of this &s;olemnity, I will endeavour to enlarge upon it with &s;uch reflections, as, I tru&s;t in GOD, will excite &s;ome &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="115" REF="150">
which may be profitable to &s;o pious a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Elijah had fled from two dreadful evils, the approach of a famine, and the per&s;ecution of Ahab an enraged enemy: and in obedience to the command of GOD had hid him&s;elf by the brook Che|rith, that is before Jordan. In this &s;afe and peaceful &s;olitude, ble&s;&s;ed with daily marks of GOD's providence, the holy man dwelt free both from the cares and glories of the world: by miraculous im|pul&s;e <HI>the ravens brought him bread and fle&s;h in the morning, and bread and fle&s;h in the evening, and he drank of the brook</HI>; till by continuance of drought, (the windows of heaven being &s;hut up in tho&s;e days for three years and &s;ix months, which was the natural cau&s;e likewi&s;e of the famine,) it came to pa&s;s after a while
<PB N="116" REF="151">
that the brook, the great fountain of his &s;upport, dried up; and he is again di|rected by the word of the Lord where to betake him&s;elf for &s;helter. He is com|manded to ari&s;e and go to Zerephath, which belongeth to Zidon, with an a&s;|&s;urance that he had di&s;po&s;ed the heart of a widow-woman there to &s;u&s;tain him.</P>
<P>The prophet follows the call of his GOD: &mdash; the &s;ame hand which brought him to the gate of the city, had led al&s;o the poor widow out of her doors, op|pre&s;&s;ed with &s;orrow. She had come forth upon a melancholy errand, to make pre|peration to eat her la&s;t meal, and &s;hare it with her child.</P>
<P>No doubt, &s;he had long fenced again&s;t this tragical, event with all the thrifty management which &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and
<PB N="117" REF="152">
parental love could in&s;pire; full, no doubt, of cares and many tender appre|hen&s;ions le&s;t her &s;lender &s;tock &s;hould fail them before the return of plenty.</P>
<P>But as &s;he was a widow, having lo&s;t the only faithful friend who would be&s;t have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in this virtuous &s;truggle, the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of the times at length overcame her; and &s;he was ju&s;t falling down an ea&s;y prey to it, when Elijah came to the place where &s;he was. <HI>And he called unto her her, and &s;aid, fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a ve&s;&s;el that I may drink. And as &s;he was going to fetch it, he called unto her and &s;aid, bring me, I pray thee, a mor&s;el of bread in thine hand. And &s;he &s;aid, as the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cru&s;e, and behold I am gathering two &s;ticks, that</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="153">
<HI>I may go in and dre&s;s it for me and my &s;on, that we may eat it and die. And Elijah &s;aid unto her, fear not, but go, and do as thou ha&s;t &s;aid; but make me thereof a little cake fir&s;t, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy &s;on. For thus &s;ays the Lord God of I&s;rael, the bar|rel of meal &s;hall not wa&s;te, neither &s;hall the cru&s;e of oil fail, until the day that the Lord &s;endeth rain upon the earth.</HI></P>
<P>True charity is always unwilling to find excu&s;es &mdash; el&s;e here was a fair op|portunity of pleading many: &s;he might have in&s;i&s;ted over again upon her &s;itua|tion, which nece&s;&s;arily tied up her hands; &mdash; &s;he might have urged the unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s of the reque&s;t; &mdash; that &s;he was reduced to the lowe&s;t extremity already; &mdash; and that it was contrary to ju&s;tice and the fir&s;t law of nature, to rob her&s;elf and
<PB N="119" REF="154">
child of their la&s;t mor&s;el, and give it to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>But, in generous &s;pirits, compa&s;&s;ion is &s;ometimes more than a ballance for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. For, as GOD certainly in|terwove that friendly &s;oftne&s;s in our na|ture to be a check upon too great a pro|pen&s;ity towards &s;elf-love &mdash; &s;o it &s;eemed to operate here. &mdash; For it is ob&s;ervable, that though the prophet backed his re|que&s;t with the promi&s;e or an immediate recompence in multiplying her &s;tock; yet it is not evident, &s;he was influenced at all by that temptation. For if &s;he had, doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t have wrought &s;uch a mixture of &s;elf-intere&s;t into the motive of her compliance, as mu&s;t great|ly have allayed the merit of the action. But this I &s;ay, does not appear, but rather the contrary, from the reflection
<PB N="120" REF="155">
&s;he makes upon the whole in the la&s;t ver&s;e of the chapter. <HI>Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides as &s;he was an inhabitant of Zerephath, (or, as it is called by St. Luke, Sarepta, &s;ubject to Sidon the me|tropolis of Phoenicia, without the bounds of GOD's people,) &s;he had been brought up in gro&s;s darkne&s;s and idolatry, in utter ignorance of the Lord GOD of I&s;rael: or, if &s;he had heard of his name, which is all that &s;eems probable, &s;he had been taught to di&s;believe the mighty wonders of his hand, and was &s;till le&s;s likely to believe his prophet.</P>
<P>Moreover &s;he might argue, if this man by &s;ome &s;ecret my&s;tery of his own,
<PB N="121" REF="156">
or through the power of his GOD, is able to procure &s;o preternatural a &s;upply for me, whence comes it to pa&s;s, that he now &s;tands in want him&s;elf, oppre&s;&s;ed both with hunger and thir&s;t?</P>
<P>It appears therefore, that &s;he mu&s;t have been wrought upon by an unmixed principle of humanity. &mdash; She look'd upon him as a fellow-partner almo&s;t in the &s;ame affliction with her&s;elf. &mdash; She con&s;idered he had come a weary pilgri|mage, in a &s;ultry climate, through an exhau&s;ted country; where neither bread or water were to be had, but by acts of liberality. &mdash; That he had come an un|known traveller, and as a hard heart never wants a pretence, that this circum|&s;tance, which &s;hould rather have be|friended, might have helped to oppre&s;s him. &mdash; She con&s;idered, for charity is
<PB N="122" REF="157">
ever fruitful in kind rea&s;ons, that he was now far from his own country, and had &s;trayed out of the reach of the ten|der offices of &s;ome one who affectionately mourned his ab&s;ence &mdash; her heart was touched with pity. &mdash; She turned in &s;i|lence and <HI>went and did according as he had &s;aid. And behold, both &s;he and he and her hou&s;e did eat many days</HI>; or, as in the margin, one whole year. <HI>And the barrel of meal wa&s;ted not, neither did the cru&s;e of oil fail, until the day that God &s;ent rain upon the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Though it may not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e conjectures here upon this event, yet it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, the danger of the famine being thus unexpectedly got over, that the mother began to look hopefully forwards upon the re&s;t of her days. There were many widows in I&s;|rael
<PB N="123" REF="158">
at that time, when the heavens were &s;hut up for three years and &s;ix months, yet, as St. Luke ob&s;erves, <HI>to none of them was the prophet &s;ent, &s;ave to this widow of Sarepta:</HI> in all likelihood, &s;he would not be the la&s;t in making the &s;ame ob&s;ervation, and drawing from it &s;ome flattering conclu&s;ion in favour of her &s;on. &mdash; Many a parent would build high, upon a wor&s;e foundation. &mdash; 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Since the GOD of I&s;rael has thus &s;ent his own me&s;&s;enger to us in our di&s;tre&s;s, to pa&s;s by &s;o many hou&s;es of his own people, and &s;top at mine, to &s;ave it in &s;o miraculous a manner from de|&s;truction; doubtle&s;s, this is but an earne&s;t of his future kind intentions to us: at lea&s;t, his goodne&s;s has de|creed to comfort my old age by the long life and health of my &s;on: &mdash; but perhaps, he has &s;omething greater
<PB N="124" REF="159">
&s;till in &s;tore for him, and I &s;hall live to &s;ee the &s;ame hand hereafter crown his head with glory and honour?"</Q>
We may naturally &s;uppo&s;e her innocent|ly carried away with &s;uch thoughts, when &s;he is called back by an unexpected di|&s;temper which &s;urpri&s;es her &s;on, and in one moment brings down all her hopes &mdash; <HI>for his &s;ickne&s;s was &s;o &s;ore that there was no breath left in him.</HI> &mdash; </P>
<P>The expo&s;tulations of immoderate grief are &s;eldom ju&s;t &mdash; For, though Elijah had already pre&s;erved her &s;on, as well as her&s;elf from immediate death, and was the la&s;t cau&s;e to be &s;u&s;pected of &s;o &s;ad an accident; yet the pa&s;&s;ionate mother in the fir&s;t tran&s;port challenges him as the author of her misfortune; &mdash; as if he had brought down &s;orrow upon a hou&s;e, which had &s;o ho&s;pitably
<PB N="125" REF="160">
&s;heltered him. The prophet was too full of compa&s;&s;ion, to make reply to &s;o unkind an accu&s;ation. He takes the dead child <HI>out of his mother's bo&s;om, and laid him upon his own bed; and he cried unto the Lord and &s;aid, O Lord my God! ha&s;t thou brought evil upon the widow with whom I &s;ojourn, by &s;laying her &s;on?</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is this the reward of all her charity and goodne&s;s? thou ha&s;t before this robbed her of the dear partner of all her joys and all her cares; and now that &s;he is a widow, and has mo&s;t rea|&s;on to expect thy protection; behold thou ha&s;t withdrawn her la&s;t prop: thou ha&s;t taken away her child, the only &s;tay &s;he had to re&s;t on."</Q>
 &mdash; <HI>And Elijah cried unto God, and &s;aid, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's &s;oul come into him again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="161">The prayer was urgent, and be&s;poke the di&s;tre&s;s of a humane mind deeply &s;uffering in the misfortunes of another; &mdash; moreover his heart was rent with other pa&s;&s;ions. &mdash; He was zealous for the name and honour of his GOD, and thought not only his omnipotence, but his glori|ous attribute of mercy concern'd in the event: for, oh! with what triumph would the prophets of Baal retort his own bitter taunt, and &s;ay, <HI>his God was either talking, or he was pur&s;uing, or was in a journey; or peradventure he &s;lept and &s;hould have been awaked.</HI> &mdash; He was more|over involved in the &s;ucce&s;s of his prayer him&s;elf; &mdash; hone&s;t minds are mo&s;t hurt by &s;candal. &mdash; And he was afraid, le&s;t &s;o foul a one, &s;o unworthy of his cha|racter, might ari&s;e among&s;t the heathen, who would report with plea&s;ure,

<P><PB N="158" REF="191">The phari&s;ee, in&s;tead of an act of hu|miliation in that awful pre&s;ence before which he &s;tood, &mdash; with an air of triumph and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, thanks GOD that he had not made him like others &mdash; extorti|oners, adulterers, unju&s;t, or even as this publican. &mdash; The publican is repre&s;ented as &s;tanding afar off, and with a heart touch|ed with humility from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s, is &s;aid only to have &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying &mdash; GOD be merciful to me a &s;inner. I tell you, adds our SAVIOUR, this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the other.</P>
<P>Though the ju&s;tice of this determina|tion &s;trikes every one at fir&s;t &s;ight, it may not be ami&s;s to enter into a more par|ticular examination of the evidence and rea&s;ons upon which it might be founded,
<PB N="159" REF="192">
not only becau&s;e it may place the equity of this deci&s;ion in favour of the pub|lican in a &s;tronger light, but that the &s;ubject &s;eems likely to lead me to a train of reflections not un&s;uitable to the &s;o|lemnity of the &s;ea&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preached in <HI>Lent.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The phari&s;ee was one of that &s;ect, who, in our SAVIOUR's time, what by the au&s;terity of their lives &mdash; their pub|lic alms-deeds, and greater pretences to piety than other men, had gradually wrought them&s;elves into much credit and reputation with the people: and indeed as the bulk of the&s;e are ea&s;ily caught with appearances, their character &s;eems to have been admirably well &s;uited to &s;uch a purpo&s;e &mdash; If you looked no farther than the outward part of it, you would think it made up of all goodne&s;s and perfection; an uncommon &s;anctity
<PB N="160" REF="193">
of life, guarded by great decorum and &s;everity of manners, &mdash; profu&s;e and fre|quent charities to the poor, &mdash; many acts of religion, much ob&s;ervance of the law &mdash; much, ab&s;tinence &mdash; much prayer. &mdash; </P>
<P>It is painful to &s;u&s;pect the appearance of &s;o much good &mdash; and would have been &s;o here, had not our ble&s;&s;ed SA|VIOUR left us their real character upon record, and drawn up by him&s;elf in one word &mdash; that the &s;ect were like whitened &s;epulchres, all fair and beautiful without, and enriched there with whatever could attract the eye of the beholder; but, when &s;earched within&s;ide, were full of corruption and of whatever could &s;hock and di&s;gu&s;t the &s;earcher. So that with all their affectation of piety, and more extraordinary &s;trictne&s;s and regularity in
<PB N="161" REF="194">
their outward deportment, all was irre|gular and uncultivated within &mdash; and all the&s;e fair pretences, how promi&s;ing &s;o|ever, bla&s;ted by the indulgence of the wor&s;t of human pa&s;&s;ions; &mdash; pride &mdash; &s;piritual pride, the wor&s;t of all pride &mdash; hypocri&s;y, &s;elf-love, covetuou&s;ne&s;s, ex|tortion, cruelty and revenge. What pity it is that the &s;acred name of reli|gion &s;hould ever have been borrowed, and employed in &s;o bad a work, as in covering over &s;uch a black catalogue of vices &mdash; or that the fair form of virtue &s;hould have been thus di&s;graced and for ever drawn into &s;u&s;picion, from the un|worthy u&s;es of this kind, to which the artful and abandoned have often put her. The phari&s;ee &s;eems to have had not many &s;cruples of this kind, and the prayer he makes u&s;e of in the temple is a true picture of the man's heart, and
<PB N="162" REF="195">
&s;hews with what a di&s;po&s;ition and frame of mind he came to wor&s;hip. &mdash; </P>
<P>GOD! I thank thee that thou ha&s;t formed me of different materials from the re&s;t of my &s;pecies, whom thou ha&s;t created frail and vain by nature, but by choice and di&s;po&s;ition utterly corrupt and wicked.</P>
<P>Me, thou ha&s;t fa&s;hioned in a different mould, and ha&s;t infu&s;ed &s;o large a por|tion of thy &s;pirit into me, lo! I am rai&s;ed above the temptations and de&s;ires to which fle&s;h and blood are &s;ubject &mdash; I thank thee that thou ha&s;t made me thus &mdash; not a frail ve&s;&s;el of clay, like that of other men &mdash; or even this publican, but that I &s;tand here a cho&s;en and &s;anctified ve&s;&s;el unto thee.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="196">After this obvious paraphra&s;e upon the words, which &s;peaks no more than the true &s;pirit of the phari&s;ee's prayer, &mdash; you will naturally a&s;k what rea&s;on was there for all this triumph &mdash; or what foundation could he have to in&s;ult in this manner over the infirmities of man|kind &mdash; or even tho&s;e of the humble publican who &s;tood before him? &mdash; why, &s;ays he, I give tithes of all that I po&s;|&s;e&s;s. &mdash; Truly a very indifferent account of him&s;elf &mdash; and if that was all he had to offer in his own behalf, GOD knows, it was but a weak foundation to &s;upport &s;o much arrogance and &s;elf-conceit; be|cau&s;e the ob&s;ervance of both the one and the other of the&s;e ordinances might be &s;uppo&s;ed well enough to be con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t profligate, of life and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="197">The conduct and behaviour of the publican appears very different &mdash; and indeed as much the rever&s;e to this, as you could conceive. But before we en|ter upon that, as I have &s;poke largely to the character of the phari&s;ee, 'twill be but ju&s;tice to &s;ay a word or two in general to his. &mdash; The publican was one of that order of men employed by the Roman emperors in levying the taxes and contributions which were from time to time exacted from Judea as a con|quered nation. Whether, from the par|ticular fate of that employment, owing to the fixed aver&s;ion which men have to part with what is their own, or from whatever other cau&s;es it happened &mdash; &s;o it was, that the whole &s;et of men were odious, in&s;omuch that the name of a publican was a term of reproach and in|famy among&s;t the Jews.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="198">Perhaps the many in&s;tances of rigour to which their office might direct them &mdash; heightened &s;ometimes by a mixture of cruelty and in&s;olence of their own &mdash; and po&s;&s;ibly always made to appear wor&s;e than they were by the loud clamours and mi&s;repre&s;entations of others &mdash; all might have contributed to form and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ix this odium. But it was here no doubt, as in all other cla&s;&s;es of men, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions expo&s;e them to more temp|tations than that of others &mdash; that there are numbers who &s;till behave well, and who, amid&s;t all the &s;nares and opportu|nities which lye in their way, &mdash; pa&s;s through them, not only with an un|blemi&s;hed character, but with the in|ward te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The publican in all likelihood was one of the&s;e &mdash; and the &s;entiments of
<PB N="166" REF="199">
candour and humility which the view of his condition in&s;pired, are &s;uch as could come only from a heart and character thus de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>He goes up into the temple to pay his &s;acrifice of prayer &mdash; in the di&s;charge of which, he pleads no merit of his own &mdash; enters into no compari&s;on with others, &mdash; or ju&s;tification of him&s;elf with GOD, but in reverence to that holier part of the temple where his pre&s;ence was &s;up|po&s;ed more immediately to be di&s;played &mdash; he keeps afar off &mdash; is afraid to lift up his eyes towards heaven &mdash; but &s;mites upon his brea&s;t, and in a &s;hort but fervent ejaculation &mdash; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively begs GOD to have mercy upon his &s;ins. O GOD! how precious! how amiable! is true hu|mility? what a difference in thy &s;ight does it make to con&s;i&s;t betwixt man and
<PB N="167" REF="200">
man! Pride was not made for a crea|ture with &s;uch manifold imperfections &mdash; religious pride is a dre&s;s which &s;till wor&s;e becomes him &mdash; becau&s;e, of all others, 'tis that to which he has lea&s;t pretence &mdash; the be&s;t of us fall &s;even times a day, and thereby add &s;ome degree of unprofitablene&s;s to the character of tho&s;e who do all that is commanded them &mdash; was I perfect therefore, &s;ays Job, I would not know my &s;oul, I would be &s;ilent, I would be ignorant of my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, for &s;hould I &s;ay I was per|fect, it would prove me to be perver&s;e. From this introduction I will take occa|&s;ion to recommend this virtue of religi|ous humility which &s;o naturally falls from the &s;ubject, and which cannot more effectually be enforced, than by an en|quiry into the chief cau&s;es which pro|duce
<PB N="168" REF="201">
the oppo&s;ite vice to it &mdash; that of &s;piritual pride &mdash; for in this malady of the mind of man &mdash; the ca&s;e is parallel with mo&s;t others of his body, the dan|gers of which can never rightly be ap|prehended; or can remedies be applied either with judgment or &s;ucce&s;s, till they are traced back to their fir&s;t principles, and the &s;eeds of the di&s;order are laid open and con&s;idered. And fir&s;t, I believe, one of the mo&s;t general cau&s;es of &s;piri|tual pride, is that which &s;eems to have mi&s;led the phari&s;ee &mdash; a mi&s;taken notion of the true principles of his religion. He thought, no doubt, that the whole of it was comprehended in the two arti|cles of paying tythes and frequent fa&s;t|ing, and that when he had di&s;charged his con&s;cience of them &mdash; he had done all that was required at his hands, and might
<PB N="169" REF="202">
with rea&s;on go, and thank GOD that he had not made him like others. &mdash; It is not to be que&s;tioned, but through force of this error, the phari&s;ee might think him&s;elf to be, what he pretended, a re|ligious and upright man. &mdash; For how|ever he might be brought to act a double and in&s;incere part in the eyes of men upon worldly views &mdash; it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed &mdash; that when he &s;tood by him|&s;elf, apart in the temple, and no wit|ne&s;&s;es of what pa&s;&s;ed between him and his GOD &mdash; that he &s;hould knowingly and wilfully have dared to act &s;o open and barefaced a &s;cene of mockery in the face of Heaven. This is &s;carce proba|ble &mdash; and therefore it mu&s;t have been ow|ing to &s;ome delu&s;ion in his education, which had early implanted in his mind fal&s;e and wretched notions of the e&s;&s;en|tials of religion &mdash; which as he grew up
<PB N="170" REF="203">
had proved the &s;eeds of infinite error, both in practice and &s;peculation. &mdash; </P>
<P>With the re&s;t of his &s;ect, he had been &s;o principled and in&s;tructed as to ob&s;erve a &s;crupulous nicety and mo&s;t religious exactne&s;s in the le&s;&s;er matters of his re|ligion &mdash; its frequent wa&s;hings &mdash; its fa&s;t|ings and other external rites of no merit in them&s;elves &mdash; but to be exempted, from the more trouble&s;ome exactne&s;s in the weightier matters of the law, which were of eternal and unchangeable obli|gation. So that, they were in truth blind guides &mdash; who thus would &s;train at a gnat and yet &s;wallow a camel, and as our SAVIOUR reproves them from a familiar in&s;tance of dome&s;tic incon&s;i&s;tency &mdash; would make clean the out&s;ide of the cup and platter &mdash; yet &s;uffer the in&s;ide &mdash; the mo&s;t material part, to be full of cor|ruption
<PB N="171" REF="204">
and exce&s;s. From this know|ledge of the character and principles of the phari&s;ee, 'tis ea&s;y to account for his &s;entiments and behaviour in the temple, which were ju&s;t &s;uch as they would have led one to have expected.</P>
<P>Thus it has always happened, by a fa|tality common to all &s;uch abu&s;es of reli|gion as make it to con&s;i&s;t in external rites and ceremonies more than inward purity and integrity of heart. &mdash; As the&s;e outward things are ea&s;ily put in practice &mdash; and capable of being attained to, without much capacity, or much oppo|&s;ition to fle&s;h and blood &mdash; it too naturally betrays the profe&s;&s;ors of it, into a ground|le&s;s per&s;ua&s;ion of their own godline&s;s and a de&s;picable one of that of others, in their religious capacities, and the relations in which they &s;tand towards GOD: which is the very definition of &s;piritual pride.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="205">When the true heat and &s;pirit of de|votion is thus lo&s;t and extingui&s;hed un|der a cloud of o&s;tentatious ceremonies and ge&s;tures, as is remarkable in the Ro|man church &mdash; where the celebration of high ma&s;s, when &s;et off to the be&s;t ad|vantage with all its &s;cenical decorations and finery, looks more like a theatrical performance, than that humble and &s;o|lemn appeal which du&s;t and a&s;hes are offering up to the throne of GOD, &mdash; when religion I &s;ay, is thus clogged and bore down by &s;uch a weight of ceremo|nies &mdash; it is much ea&s;ier to put in pre|tentions to holine&s;s upon &s;uch a mecha|nical &s;y&s;tem as is left of it, than where the character is only to be got and main|tained by a painful conflict and perpe|tual war again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions. 'Tis ea&s;ier, for in&s;tance, for a zealous papi&s;t to cro&s;s him&s;elf and tell his beads, than for an humble prote&s;tant to &s;ubdue the lu&s;ts of
<PB N="173" REF="206">
anger, intemperance, cruelty and re|venge, to appear before his maker with that preparation of mind which becomes him. The operation of being &s;prinkled with holy water, is not &s;o difficult in it|&s;elf, as that of being cha&s;te and &s;potle&s;s within &mdash; con&s;cious of no dirty thought or di&s;hone&s;t action. 'Tis a much &s;horter way to kneel down at a confe&s;&s;ional and receive ab&s;olution &mdash; than to live &s;o as to de&s;erve it &mdash; not at the hands of men &mdash; but at the hands of GOD &mdash; who &s;ees the heart and cannot be impo&s;ed on. &mdash; The atchievement of keeping lent, or ab&s;taining from fle&s;h on certain days, is not &s;o hard, as that of ab&s;taining from the works of it at all times &mdash; e&s;pecially, as the point is generally managed among&s;t the richer &s;ort with &s;uch art and epicu|ri&s;m at their tables &mdash; and with &s;uch in|dulgence to a poor mortified appetite &mdash; that an entertainment upon a fa&s;t is much
<PB N="174" REF="207">
more likely to produce a <HI>&s;urfeit</HI> than a fit of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>One might run the parallel much farther, but this may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew how dangerous and delu&s;ive the&s;e mi&s;takes are &mdash; how apt to mi&s;lead and over&s;et weak minds, which are ever apt to be caught by the pomp of &s;uch external parts of religion. &mdash; This is &s;o evident, that even in our own church, where there is the greate&s;t cha&s;tity in things of this nature &mdash; and of which none are retained in our wor&s;hip, but what I believe, tend to excite and a&s;&s;i&s;t it &mdash; yet &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity is there in our nature to &s;en&s;e &mdash; and &s;o unequal a match is the under&s;tanding of the bulk of man|kind, for the impre&s;&s;ions of outward things &mdash; that we &s;ee thou&s;ands who every day mi&s;take the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance, and was it fairly put to the trial would exchange the reality for the appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="208">You &s;ee, this was almo&s;t univer&s;ally the ca&s;e of the Jewi&s;h church &mdash; where, for want of proper guard and di&s;tinction betwixt the means of religion and religion it&s;elf, the ceremonial part in time eat away the moral part, and left nothing but a &s;hadow behind. &mdash; 'Tis to be feared the buffooneries of the Romi&s;h church, bid fair to do it the &s;ame ill office, to the di&s;grace and utter ruin of chri&s;tianity wherever popery is e&s;tabli&s;hed. What then remains, but that we rectify the&s;e gro&s;s and pernicious notions of religion, and place it upon its true bottom, which we can only do, by bringing back reli|gion to that cool point of rea&s;on which fir&s;t &s;hewed us its obligation &mdash; by al|ways remembering that GOD is a &s;pirit &mdash; and mu&s;t be wor&s;hipped &s;uitable to his nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> in &s;pirit and in truth &mdash; and that the mo&s;t acceptable &s;acrifice we can
<PB N="176" REF="209">
offer him is a virtuous and an upright mind &mdash; and however nece&s;&s;ary it is, not to leave the ceremonial and po&s;itive parts of religion undone &mdash; yet not like the phari&s;ee to re&s;t there &mdash; and omit the weightier matters, but keep this in view perpetually, that though the in&s;trumen|tal duties are duties of unque&s;tionable obligation to us &mdash; yet they are &s;till but INSTRUMENTAL DUTIES, condu|cive to the great end of all religion &mdash; which is to purify our hearts &mdash; and conquer our pa&s;&s;ions &mdash; and in a word, to make us wi&s;er and better men &mdash; better neighbours &mdash; better citizens &mdash; and better &s;ervants to GOD. &mdash; To whom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
