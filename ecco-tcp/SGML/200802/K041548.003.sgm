A Critic, who lately ro&s;e to great eminence in our own country, has endeavoured by a more &s;ingular method to damp the ardour of inventive Genius, and to annihilate the hopes of all who would a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of originality in this higher &s;pecies of poetical compo&s;ition. He has attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h a Triumvirate in the Epic world, with a perpetuity of dominion. Every reader who is conver&s;ant with modern critici&s;m, will perceive that I allude to the following pa&s;&s;age in the famous Di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ixth Book of Virgil:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t as Virgil rivalled Homer, &s;o Milton emulated both of them. He found Ho|mer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the province of Morality; Virgil of Politics; and nothing left for him but that of Religion. This he &s;eized, as a&s;piring to &s;hare with them in the government of the Poetic world: and, by means of the &s;uperior dignity of his &s;ub|ject, hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate, which took &s;o many ages in forming. The&s;e are the three &s;pecies of the Epic Poem; for its large&s;t &s;phere is <HI>human action,</HI> which can be con&s;idered
<PB N="138" REF="136">
but in a <HI>moral,</HI> political, or religious view: and The&s;e the three <HI>Makers;</HI> for each of their Poems was &s;truck out at a heat, and came to perfection from its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay. Here then the grand &s;cene was clo&s;ed, and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end."</Q></P>
<P>I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> (to u&s;e the favourite expre&s;&s;ion of the author I have quoted) than the preceding lines. Surely Milton is him&s;elf a proof that <HI>human action</HI> is not the large&s;t &s;phere of the Epic Poem; and as to Virgil, his mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate admirers mu&s;t allow, that in &s;ubject and de&s;ign he is much le&s;s of an original than Camoens or Lucan. But &s;uch a critical &s;tatute of limitation, if I may call it &s;o, is not le&s;s pernicious than ab&s;urd. To di&s;|figure the &s;phere of Imagination with the&s;e capri|cious and arbitrary zones, is an injury to &s;cience. Such Critici&s;m, in&s;tead of giving &s;pirit and ener|gy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet, can only lead him to &s;tart like Macbeth at unreal mockery, and to exclaim, when he is invited

<P>I have ventured to &s;uppo&s;e that Greece produced no worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Homer, and that her ex|ploits again&s;t the Per&s;ians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner &s;uitable to &s;o &s;ublime a &s;ub|ject:&mdash;yet an author named Chaerilus is &s;aid to have recorded tho&s;e triumphs of his country in

But from the general &s;ilence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet, we may, I think, very fairly conjecture that his compo&s;itions were not many degrees &s;uperior to tho&s;e of his unfortunate name&s;ake, who frequented the court of Alexander the Great, and is &s;aid to have &s;ung the exploits of his Sovereign, on the curious con|ditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good ver&s;e, and a box on the ear for every bad one. The old Scholia&s;t on Horace, who has pre&s;erved this idle &s;tory, concludes it by &s;aying, that the mi&s;erable Bard was beat to death in con&s;equence of his contract. Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be confounded, both by Horace him&s;elf, and after|wards by Scaliger, with the Chaerilus rewarded

The &s;crap pre&s;er|ved by Ari&s;totle in his Rhetoric is only half a ver&s;e, and quoted without any commendation of its author. The two citations in Strabo amount to little more. The curious reader may al&s;o find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus, attri|buted to this Poet; who is mentioned by the &s;ame author as peculiarly addicted to the gro&s;&s;er exce&s;&s;es of the table.&mdash;Let us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has <Q REND="inline">"damn'd to everla&s;ting fame."</Q> The judicious and elegant Roman Satiri&s;t &s;eems remarkably unju&s;t in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his pa|tron Augu&s;tus, at the expence of the Macedonian hero.

per&s;ua&s;ion concerning the purpo&s;e of Homer was entertained at Athens; and 2dly, Becau&s;e it gives me a plea&s;ing opportunity of &s;upporting the learned Madame Dacier again&s;t an ill|grounded cen&s;ure of a late Engli&s;h critic. In her Preface to the Ody&s;&s;ey, &s;he a&s;&s;erts, that the judgment of antiquity decided in favour of the Iliad; and &s;he appeals to part of the &s;entence in Plato, to which I have alluded, as a proof of her a&s;&s;ertion. Mr. Wood, in a note to the Intro|duction of his E&s;&s;ay on Homer, endeavours to &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of this proof; and &s;till farther, to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly mi&s;taken in her &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age to which &s;he appealed. If he ventures to con|tradict this learned lady, he does not however in&s;ult her with that in&s;olent pertne&s;s with which &s;he is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer; and which, for the honour of our Eng|li&s;h Poet, I will not &s;uppo&s;e to be his. But though Mr. Wood endeavours to &s;upport his opinion by argument, I apprehend that he is
<PB N="148" REF="146">
him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in under&s;tanding the words of Socrates in their literal &s;en&s;e, without the lea&s;t mixture of irony. It is true, indeed, that the aim of Socrates, in the cour&s;e of the dialogue, is to ridicule the pre&s;umption and ignorance of the &s;ophi&s;t Hippias, in the mo&s;t ironical manner; but the particular &s;peech on which Madame Dacier founds her opinion, is a plain and &s;imple addre&s;s to Eudicus, before he enters on his de|bate with the Sophi&s;t. It turns on the mo&s;t &s;imple circum&s;tance, the truth of which Eu|dicus could hardly be ignorant of, namely, the &s;entiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer. As the&s;e &s;entiments are &s;uch as I believe mo&s;t admirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in que&s;tion, I per|fectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and &s;erious, when he &s;ays to Eudicus, <Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">

&s;uch periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden, when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly under&s;tood, we can ea&s;ily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the ma&s;k of &s;uch heroic names as hi&s;tory could &s;upply, and their genius accommodate to their purpo&s;e. We find accordingly, that the Roman Bard is &s;uppo&s;ed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas, and that the Engli&s;h Poet has, with equal ingenuity, enwrapt the di&s;|&s;olute Charles the Second in the Jewi&s;h robes of King David. But in &s;o rude an age as we mu&s;t admit that of Homer to have been; when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art; when he had no hi&s;tory to con&s;ult, perhaps no patron to flatter, and no critics to elude or obey; in &s;uch an age, may we not more naturally conjecture, that poetical compo&s;ition was neither laboured in its form, nor deep in its de&s;ign? that, in&s;tead of being the &s;low and &s;y&s;|tematic

The &s;evere&s;t enemies of Warburton mu&s;t indeed allow, that &s;everal of his remarks on his Poetical Patron are entitled to pre&s;ervation, by their u&s;e or beauty; but the greater part, I ap|prehend, are equally de&s;titute of both: and how far the Critic was capable of di&s;gracing the Poet, mu&s;t be evident to every reader who recollects that the non&s;en&s;e in the E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, where Pega&s;us is made to <HI>&s;natch a grace,</HI> which is ju&s;tly cen&s;ured by Dr. Warton, was fir&s;t introduced into the poem by an arbitrary tran&s;po&s;ition of the editor.</P>
<P>Though arrogance is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing and characteri&s;tical defect in the compo&s;ition of this a&s;&s;uming Commentator, he had certainly other critical failings of con&s;iderable importance; and it may po&s;&s;ibly be rendering &s;ome little &s;er|vice to the art which he profe&s;&s;ed, to inve&s;tigate the peculiarities in this &s;ingular writer, which con&s;pire to plunge him in the crowd of tho&s;e <HI>evane&s;cent critics</HI> (if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion)

critic;&mdash;&s;trong under&s;tanding, lively imagination, and refined &s;en&s;ibility. The fir&s;t was the characteri&s;tic of Ari&s;totle; and, by the con&s;ent of all ages, he is allowed to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed it in a &s;uperlative degree. May I be par|doned for the opinion, that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the <HI>other two?</HI> I would not ab&s;olutely &s;ay, that he had neither Fancy nor Feel|ing: but that his imagination was <HI>not brilliant,</HI> and that his &s;en&s;ibility was not exqui&s;ite, may, I think, be fairly pre&s;umed from the general tenor of his pro&s;e; nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea. The two qualities in which Ari&s;totle may be &s;uppo&s;ed defective, were the very two which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h Lon|ginus; who certainly wanted not under&s;tanding, though he might not po&s;&s;e&s;s the philo&s;ophical &s;agacity of the Stagyrite. When con&s;idered in every point of view, he appears the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate character among the Critics of anti|quity. If Warburton bore any re&s;emblance to either of the&s;e mighty names, I apprehend it
<PB N="167" REF="165">
mu&s;t be to the former, and perhaps in imagina|tion he was &s;uperior to Ari&s;totle: but, of the three qualities which I have ventured to con|&s;ider as requi&s;ite in the perfect Critic, I conceive him to have been mi&s;erably deficient in the la&s;t, and certainly the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of the three; for, as the great Commentator of Horace has phi|lo&s;ophically and truly remarked, in a note to that Poet, <Q REND="inline">"Feeling, or Sentiment, is not only the &s;ure&s;t, but the &s;ole ultimate arbiter of works of genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, ver. 210.</NOTE>."</Q> A man may po&s;&s;e&s;s an acute un|der&s;tanding and a lively imagination, without being a found Critic; and this truth perhaps cannot be more clearly &s;hewn than in the writings of Warburton. His under&s;tanding was undoubtedly acute, his imagination was lively; but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means &s;ynonymous: and he certainly wanted tho&s;e finer feelings, which con&s;titute accuracy of di&s;cernment, and a perfect percep|tion of literary excellence. In con&s;equence
<PB N="168" REF="166">
of this defect, in&s;tead of &s;eizing the real &s;en&s;e and intended beauties of an author, he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy, which led him in que&s;t of &s;ecret meanings and my&s;terious allu&s;ions; the&s;e he readily found, and his powers of under&s;tanding enabled him to dre&s;s them up in a plau&s;ible and &s;pecious form, and to per&s;uade many readers that he was (what he believed him&s;elf to be) the re&s;torer of genuine Critici&s;m. As a farther proof that he was de&s;ti|tute of refined &s;en&s;ibility, I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction, which, as Dr. John|&s;on has very ju&s;tly remarked, is coar&s;e and im|pure. Perhaps it may be found, that in pro|portion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I &s;uppo&s;e him to have wanted, they have been more or le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ea&s;e, the elegance, and the beauty of their language: were I required to fortify this conjecture by ex|amples, I &s;hould produce the names of Virgil and Racine, of Fenelon and Addi&s;on&mdash;that Addi&s;on, who, though in&s;ulted by the Com|mentator

This has vi&s;ibly been the ca&s;e in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Ari&s;totle, Horace, and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry. In our own country, the rules of the Drama, for in&s;tance,

Perhaps our acquaint|ance with tho&s;e writings of Greece and Rome, which were &s;ub&s;equent to Ari&s;totle and Horace, is not &s;ufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in re&s;pect to tho&s;e countries. But with regard to France, may we not a&s;&s;ert, that her po|etical productions, which aro&s;e after the publica|tion of Boileau's Didactic E&s;&s;ay, are at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;uperior, to tho&s;e which preceded that period? If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem, it is allowed to be the be&s;t which the French have to boa&s;t; not to mention the
<PB N="172" REF="170">
dramatic works of that extraordinary and univer|&s;al author. If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true, I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e it to ari&s;e from the irritable nature of the poetic &s;pirit, &s;o peculiarly aver&s;e to re&s;traint and controul. The Bard who could gallop his Pega&s;us over a free and open plain, might be eager to engage in &s;o plea&s;ing an exerci&s;e; but he who ob&s;erved the direction|po&s;ts &s;o thickly and &s;o perver&s;ely planted, that, in|&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his career, they mu&s;t probably oc|ca&s;ion his fall, would ea&s;ily be tempted to de&s;cend from his &s;teed, and to decline the cour&s;e. Let me illu&s;trate this conjecture by a &s;triking fact, in the very words of the Poet ju&s;t mentioned, who was by no means deficient in poetical confi|dence, and who has left us the following anec|dote of him&s;elf, in that plea&s;ing little anony|mous work, intitled, Commentaire Hi&s;torique &s;ur les Oeuvres de l'Auteur de la Henriade. <Q REND="inline">"Il lut un jour plu&s;ieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Pr&eacute;&s;ident de Mai&s;ons, &s;on intime ami.

Voltaire has pointed out, with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad; but he has frequently fallen him&s;elf into &s;imilar defects, and is equally unju&s;t to Homer, again&s;t whom he has levelled the mo&s;t bitter &s;arca&s;ms both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e. Voltaire attacking Homer, is like Paris &s;hooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles: the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors; yet Homer, like Achilles, may have his vulnerable &s;pot: but with this happy difference, that although the &s;haft of ridicule, which is pointed again&s;t him, may be tinged with venom, its wound cannot be mortal.

<P>Apollonius, &s;urnamed the Rhodian from the place of his re&s;idence, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a native of Alexandria; where he is &s;aid to have recited &s;ome portion of his Poem, while he was yet a youth.

Chri&s;t 246. That prince had been educated by the famous Ari&s;tarchus, and rivalled the pre|ceding &s;overeigns of his liberal family in the mu|nificent encouragement of learning. Apollonius was a di&s;ciple of the poet Callimachus; but their connection ended in the mo&s;t violent enmity; which was probably owing to &s;ome degree of contempt expre&s;&s;ed by Apollonius for the light compo&s;itions of his ma&s;ter. The learned have vainly endeavoured to di&s;cover the particulars of their quarrel.&mdash;The only Work of Apollo|nius which has de&s;cended to modern times, is his Poem, in four Books, on the Argonautic expe|dition. Both Longinus and Quinctilian have a&s;|&s;igned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity: but there lies an appeal from the &s;entence of the mo&s;t candid and enlightened Cri|tics to the voice of Nature; and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the deci|&s;ion of this ultimate judge. His Poem abounds in animated de&s;cription, and in pa&s;&s;ages of the

But the chief excellence in our Poet, is the &s;pirit and delicacy with which he has deli|neated the pa&s;&s;ion of love in his Medea. That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular, is &s;ufficiently evident from the minute exactne&s;s with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet. Tho&s;e who com|pare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil, may, I think, perceive not only that Dido has &s;ome features of Medea, but that the two Bards, however different in their reputation, re&s;embled each other in their genius; and that they both excel in delicacy and pathos.</P>

<P>Scaliger appears to be the mo&s;t extravagant of all the Critics who have lavi&s;hed their undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing encomiums on Virgil, by a&s;&s;erting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet. Poeti|ces, lib. iii. c. 2.&mdash;Though the opinion of Spence, and other modern Critics, concerning the cha|racter of Aeneas, con&s;idered as an allegorical portrait of Augu&s;tus, &s;eems to gain ground, yet it might perhaps be ea&s;y to overturn the inge|nious conjectures and the fanciful rea&s;oning by which that idea has been &s;upported. This attempt would have the &s;anction of one of the mo&s;t judi|cious Commentators of Virgil; for the learned Heyne expre&s;sly rejects all allegorical interpre|tation, and thinks it improbable that a Poet of &s;o correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contract and cramp his

powers. He even ventures to a&s;&s;ert, that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allego|rical portrait of Augu&s;tus, the execution of it is unhappy. The &s;tronge&s;t argument which has been adduced to &s;upport this conjecture, is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following pa&s;&s;age in the opening of the third Georgic:<Q><L>Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita &s;u|per&s;it,</L>

A licence &s;o extra|ordinary cannot even be ju&s;tified by the talents of this accompli&s;hed writer: for if the le&s;s elegant pa&s;&s;ages of the ancient Poets might be removed at plea&s;ure, their compo&s;itions would be expo&s;ed to the caprice of every fanta&s;tic commentator. The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unnece&s;&s;ary, but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the manners of his age. The cu&s;tom of erecting real temples was &s;o familiar to antiquity, that a Ro|man would never have &s;u&s;pected the edifice was to be rai&s;ed only with poetical materials. We may even conjecture, from a line of Statius, that
<PB N="193" REF="191">
the Poet him&s;elf had a temple erected to his me|mory; and, without any breach of probability, we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor &s;uch a te&s;timony of his gratitude. This adulation, though &s;hocking to us, was too gene|rally ju&s;tified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction. He had before ac|quie&s;ced in the divinity of his Imperial Pa|tron, and had expre&s;&s;ed the idea in its full &s;en&s;e:

<P>Having con&s;idered in this note &s;ome conjectures on Virgil, that appear to me fanta&s;tical and ill founded, I am tempted to produce two illu&s;tra|tions of the &s;ame great poet, which, if I am not deceived by friend&s;hip, reflect more light and honour on the fir&s;t of the Roman poets.

Among his remarks on different pa&s;&s;ages of his

I &s;hall mention them as they occurred to me. The fir&s;t of the&s;e lines is in the eighth book of the Aeneid, ver&s;e 695.

<L>Quam cum &s;anguineo &s;equitur Bellona flagello.</L></Q> The difficulty in this pa&s;&s;age is, to know what and where the two prophetic &s;nakes were behind Cleopatra's back. Mo&s;t commentators &s;ay that they were carved upon her &s;hield, which hung upon her back; but &s;urely this could not be de|&s;igned by Virgil: if he meant to repre&s;ent Cleo|patra in armour, as he undoubtedly did, he would not have hung her &s;hield behind her back in the hour of battle. In the next place, why does he give her two &s;erpents, when both her &s;culptors, painters, and hi&s;torians give her only <HI>one,</HI> the bite of which, in that country of veno|mous creatures, was quite &s;ufficient to &s;lay her.

<PB N="200" REF="198">
turning her eyes to what is carved upon her own back. If the reader is convinced that the pa&s;|&s;age wants per&s;picuity, he will be plea&s;ed to find the whole cleared up, by ob&s;erving, that the two &s;nakes were on the <HI>caduceus</HI> of <HI>Anubis,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of a <HI>dog's head</HI> on a human figure, with a <HI>caduceus</HI> in one hand, on the top of which were two beautifully curling a&s;ps or &s;nakes, and a pur&s;e or a porridge pot in his left <HI>(Le Pluche)</HI>&mdash;from whence the Greeks, perhaps, without knowing the meaning of this emblem, took their <HI>Mercury.</HI> They di&s;carded the <HI>dog's head,</HI> as un&s;ightly, and placed a human one in its &s;tead; by which they de&s;troyed the emblematic figures, though they left the name of <HI>latrator,</HI> or <HI>barker,</HI> &s;ufficient to lead us to its real mean|ing; which was, that of the <HI>dog-&s;tar,</HI> the ri&s;ing of which ju&s;t preceded the <HI>overflow of the Nile.</HI> As &s;oon, therefore, as the a&s;tronomers of Egypt could di&s;cern the <HI>dog-&s;tar</HI> ri&s;en in the &s;pring, they gave notice of it by their <HI>Anubis,</HI> or <HI>dog,</HI> which was hung out on their &s;everal towers, that
<PB N="201" REF="199">
all the people might fly to their terraces and places of &s;afety: but if clouds had before ob|&s;tructed the view of the &s;tar, and it was ri&s;en high before it was di&s;cerned, they added wings to his feet and &s;houlders, put his caduceus in his right hand, and a porridge pot, or pur&s;e, in his left, to hurry the people in their preparations again&s;t the deluge.

the battle of <HI>Actium,</HI> when, Antony being &s;ubdued, the whole world &s;eemed at peace, and Augu&s;tus &s;hut the gate of Janus.

It occurred to me, many years before I knew any proof of it, that "Cana Fides, et Ve&s;ta, et Remo cum fratre Quirinus," were the names of tho&s;e temples where Mecaenas held his beds of ju&s;tice; in the &s;ame manner as, in the former note, "Anu|bis" and "Deorum mon&s;tra" were only the names of the Egyptian &s;hips oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e of the Ro|mans, named Mercury, Venus, and Minerva.

The com|pliment to Mecaenas, is this: When civil wars &s;hall cea&s;e, and all power, regal, con&s;ular, and tribunitial, centre in Augu&s;tus, his friend and fa|vourite, Mecaenas, &s;hall be Praetor Urbanus; who &s;hall rule by the equitable laws &s;u&s;pended in the ancient temple of Fides, &s;hall decide civil cau&s;es in the temple and grove of Ve&s;ta, and criminal ones in the temple of Romulus and Remus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foundation walls of which &s;till remain, and on them is built a modern temple, dedicated to two brother &s;aints.&mdash;<HI>Roma Antica.</HI></NOTE>.

<L><HI>Shall Hi&s;tory's pen, to aid his vengeance won.</HI>]</L>
<P>There is hardly any eminent per&s;onage of anti|quity, who has &s;uffered more from detraction, both in his literary and moral character, than the poet Lucan. His fate, indeed, &s;eems in all points to have been peculiarly &s;evere. His early death, at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work, is it&s;elf &s;uffi|cient to excite our compa&s;&s;ion and regret; but to peri&s;h by the envious tyranny of Nero may be con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing, when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with in|famy in the immortal pages of Tacitus. As I am per&s;uaded that the great Hi&s;torian has inad|vertently adopted the gro&s;&s;e&s;t calumny again&s;t our Poet, I &s;hall mo&s;t readily a&s;&s;ign my rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o. It may fir&s;t be proper to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of Lucan's life.&mdash;He was the &s;on of Anneus Mela, the younge&s;t brother of Seneca;
<PB N="207" REF="205">
and, though born at Corduba, was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months: a circum|&s;tance, as his more indulgent critics ob&s;erve, which &s;ufficiently refutes the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e who con&s;ider his language as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus, &s;o warmly celebrated by his di&s;ciple Per&s;ius the Sa|tiri&s;t, who was the intimate friend of our Poet. In the clo&s;e of his education, Lucan is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Athens. On his return to Rome he ro&s;e to the office of Quae&s;tor, before he had attained the legal age. He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs; and married a lady of noble birth, of who&s;e amiable character I &s;hall &s;peak more at large in a &s;ub&s;equent note. Lu|can had for &s;ome time been admitted to fami|liarity with Nero, when the Emperor cho&s;e to contend for poetical honours, by the public recital of a poem he had compo&s;ed on Niobe; and &s;ome ver&s;es of this imperial production are &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;erved in the Fir&s;t Satire of Per&s;ius. Lucan had the hardine&s;s to repeat a poem
<PB N="208" REF="206">
on Orpheus, in competition with that of Nero; and, what is more remarkable, the judges of the conte&s;t were ju&s;t and bold enough to decide again&s;t the Emperor. From hence Nero became the per&s;ecutor of his &s;ucce&s;sful rival, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public. The well|known con&s;piracy of Pi&s;o again&s;t the tyrant &s;oon followed; and Tacitus, with his u&s;ual &s;arca&s;tic &s;everity, concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had re|ceived: a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Hi&s;torian; who might have found a much nobler, and I will add a more probable, motive for his conduct, in the generous ardour of his character, and his pa&s;&s;ionate adoration of freedom. In the &s;equel of his narration, Tacitus alledges a charge again&s;t our Poet, which, if it were true, mu&s;t lead us to dete&s;t him as the mo&s;t abject of mankind. The Hi&s;torian a&s;&s;erts, that Lucan, when accu&s;ed of the con&s;piracy, for &s;ome time denied the charge; but, corrupted at la&s;t by a promi&s;e of impunity, and de&s;irous to atone for
<PB N="209" REF="207">
the tardine&s;s of his confe&s;&s;ion, accu&s;ed his mother Atilla as his accomplice. This circum&s;tance is &s;o improbable in it&s;elf, and &s;o little con&s;onant to the general character of Lucan, that &s;ome writers have treated it with contempt, as a calumny in|vented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of Tacitus has given &s;uch an air of authority to the &s;tory, that it may &s;eem to de&s;erve a more &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, parti|cularly as there are two &s;ub&s;equent events re|lated by the &s;ame Hi&s;torian, which have a ten|dency to invalidate the accu&s;ation &s;o injurious to our Poet. The events I mean are, the fate of Annaeus, and the e&s;cape of Atilla, the two parents of Lucan. The former died in con&s;equence of an accu&s;ation brought again&s;t him, after the death of his &s;on, by Fabius Romanus, who had been intimate with Lucan, and forged &s;ome letters in his name, with the de&s;ign of proving his father concerned in the con&s;piracy. The&s;e letters were produced to Nero, who &s;ent them to Annaeus, from an eager de&s;ire, &s;ays Tacitus, to get po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="210" REF="208">
of his wealth. From this fact two in|ferences may be drawn, according to the differ|ent lights in which it may be con&s;idered:&mdash;If the accu&s;ation again&s;t Annaeus was ju&s;t, it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his father, and he appears the le&s;s likely to have endangered by his confe&s;&s;ion the life of a parent, to whom he owed a &s;till tenderer regard:&mdash;If Annaeus was not in|volved in the con&s;piracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the &s;ake of his trea&s;ure, we may the more readily believe, that the tyrant who mur|dered the father from avarice, might calumniate the &s;on from envy. But the e&s;cape of Atilla affords us the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery, of which Tacitus has &s;up|po&s;ed him guilty. Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice, would the vindictive and &s;anguinary Nero have &s;pared the life of a wo|man, who&s;e family he dete&s;ted, particularly when other females were put to death for their &s;hare in the con&s;piracy? That Atilla was not in that
<PB N="211" REF="209">
number, the Hi&s;torian him&s;elf informs us in the following remarkable &s;entence, Atilla mater An|naei Lucani, &s;ine ab&s;olutione, &s;ine &s;upplicio, di&s;|&s;imulata; thus tran&s;lated by Gordon: <Q REND="inline">"The information again&s;t Atilla, the mother of Lucan, was di&s;&s;embled; and, without being cleared, &s;he e&s;caped unpuni&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>The preceding remarks will, I hope, vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet; who&s;e firmne&s;s and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly di&s;played in that picture of his death which Tacitus him&s;elf has given us. I &s;hall pre&s;ent it to the Engli&s;h reader in the words of Gordon:&mdash;Lucan, <Q REND="inline">"while his blood i&s;&s;ued in &s;treams, perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and &s;tiffen, and life to retire by little and little to the extremities, while his heart was &s;till beating with vital warmth, and his faculties no wi&s;e impaired, recollected &s;ome lines of his own, which de&s;cribed a wounded &s;oldier expiring in a manner that re&s;embled this.

Such was the death of Lucan, before he had
<PB N="214" REF="212">
completed his twenty-&s;eventh year. If his cha|racter as a man has been injured by the Hi&s;to|rian, his poetical reputation has been treated not le&s;s injuriou&s;ly by the Critics. Quintilian, by a frivolous di&s;tinction, di&s;putes his title to be cla&s;|&s;ed among the Poets; and Scaliger &s;ays, with a brutality of language di&s;graceful only to him&s;elf, that he &s;eems rather to <HI>bark</HI> than to <HI>&s;ing.</HI> But the&s;e in&s;ults may appear amply compen&s;ated, when we remember, that in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations of modern Europe the mo&s;t elevated and poetic &s;pirits have been his warme&s;t admirers; that in France he was idolized by Corneille, and in England tran&s;lated by Rowe.&mdash;The &s;evere&s;t cen|&s;ures on Lucan have proceeded from tho&s;e who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil: but how unju&s;t and ab&s;urd is &s;uch a compari&s;on! it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough from the quarry, to the mo&s;t beautiful &s;uperficies of poli&s;hed marble. How differently &s;hould we think of Virgil as a poet, if we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the ver&s;es which he
<PB N="215" REF="213">
wrote at that period of life when Lucan compo|&s;ed his Phar&s;alia! In the di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubject, in the propriety and elegance of diction, he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil: but if we attend to the bold originality of his de&s;ign, and to the vigour of his &s;entiments; if we con&s;ider the Phar&s;alia as the rapid and uncorrected &s;ketch of a young poet, executed in an age when the &s;pirit of his countrymen was broken, and their ta&s;te in literature corrupted, it may ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed as one of the mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t wonderful produc|tions of the human mind.</P>

<L><HI>Let Argentaria on your canva&s;s &s;hine.</HI>]</L>
<P>Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Se|nator, and the wife of Lucan. She is &s;aid to have tran&s;cribed and corrected the three fir&s;t books of the Phar&s;alia, after the death of her hu&s;band. It is much to be regretted that we po&s;&s;e&s;s not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accompli&s;hed woman; but her name is immor|talized by two &s;urviving Poets of that age. The
<PB N="218" REF="216">
veneration which &s;he paid to the memory of her hu&s;band, is recorded by Martial; and more poe|tically de&s;cribed in that plea&s;ing and elegant lit|tle production of Statius, <HI>Genethliacon Lucani,</HI> a poem which I the more readily commend, as I may be thought by &s;ome readers unju&s;t towards its author, in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid. I confe&s;s, indeed, the mi&s;cellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his mo&s;t valuable work: in mo&s;t of the&s;e there is much imagination and &s;en|timent, in harmonious and &s;pirited ver&s;e. The little poem which I have mentioned, on the an|niver&s;ary of Lucan's birth, is &s;aid to have been written at the reque&s;t of Argentaria. The Au|thor, after invoking the poetical deities to attend the cere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">omy, touches with great delicacy and &s;pirit on the compo&s;itions of Lucan's childhood, which are lo&s;t, and the Phar&s;alia, the production of his early youth; he then pays a &s;hort compli|ment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria, la|ments the cruel fate which deprived her &s;o im|maturely

<P>I cannot clo&s;e this note without ob&s;erving, that the preceding ver&s;es have a &s;trong tendency to prove, that Lucan was perfectly innocent in regard to the accu&s;ation which I have examined before. Had he been really guilty of ba&s;ely endangering the life of his mother, it is not probable that his wife would have honoured his memory with &s;uch en|thu&s;ia&s;tic veneration, or that Statius, in ver&s;es de|&s;igned to do him honour, would have alluded to <HI>the mother</HI> of Nero.
