<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Advantage, which a Nation reaps from an Encouragement gi|ven, by Princes, to Letters in general, cannot be unknown to your Royal Highne&s;s, who&s;e exten&s;ive Knowledge in all Parts of Hi&s;tory, would make it the highe&s;t Piece of Pre&s;umption in me to pretend to quote Au|thorities to &s;hew, what Altera|tions
<PB REF="3">
the Study or Neglect of Letters have cau&s;ed in the &s;ame People.</P>
<P>Your Royal Highne&s;s's Good|ne&s;s in being graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept the Dedication of the following Scenes, &s;hews not only how much your Royal High|ne&s;s has at Heart the Advance|ment of Learning in general, but of that Branch in particu|lar, who&s;e End is to expo&s;e the Vices, and ridicule the Follies of Mankind.</P>
<P>I could have wi&s;h'd this fir&s;t Attempt had been an Offering more worthy of the high Pro|tection it receives from your Royal Highne&s;s's Name. But Comedy, tho' not the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> Production of the Mind, is not
<PB REF="4">
the lea&s;t <HI>unu&s;eful;</HI> and it is &s;uf|ficient if there is a Tendency towards doing Good, in any Work, to make that Work ap|pear de&s;erving in your Royal Highne&s;s's Eye.</P>
<P>This being the only Merit I pretend to, I beg Leave, as the mo&s;t grateful Heart always <HI>feels</HI> more than it can <HI>expre&s;s,</HI> to be allow'd to return my mo&s;t dutiful Acknowledgments by an <HI>inward Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of that profound Truth, Re&s;pect, and Gratitude, with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;continuing the acting of a Play, that has been well re|ceived by the Town in general, at a Time when it might have gone on, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome Account of what has pa&s;t &s;ince the fir&s;t Night of its Re|pre&s;entation, and of the Motives that made the Author put a Stop to its Run.</P>
<P>A Report having been maliciou&s;ly rai&s;ed, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread all over the Town, that the Play was a Party Play, and &s;upported by the Court, and therefore to be oppo&s;ed, Numbers of Per&s;ons came into the Hou&s;e with an Intent, (as the Term is) to damn it at all Events.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Thus determin'd, they took hold of every little Slip that,
<Q><L>&mdash;Aut Incuria fudit</L>
<L>Aut humana parum cavit Natura&mdash;</L></Q>
and were very clamorous: However, the Play having had a fair Hearing, went off with infinitely more <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> than <HI>Blame.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Night the particular Things objected to, being taken out, the Play was acted from Beginning to End, without one &s;ingle Mark of Di&s;plea|&s;ure in the Audience.</P>
<P>The Third Night it went off in the &s;ame Manner, to the mo&s;t numerous and &s;plendid Audience that could be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Fourth Night a Set of about eight or ten young Fellows went to the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-Hou&s;e in the Piazza, and declared publickly that they came purpo&s;ely to damn the Play, and would not leave the Play-hou&s;e till they had compa&s;&s;ed their Ends. The &s;ame De|claration they repeated when in the Hou&s;e to &s;ome Gentlemen that wero there,
<PB REF="7">
Friends (but unknown to them) to the Author.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>Ryan</HI> coming on to &s;peak the <HI>Prologue,</HI> they began their Up|roar, but were &s;oon &s;ilenced, and the <HI>Prologue</HI> was heard with Applau&s;e: The Play beginning, they began again, and were &s;o loud that Mr. <HI>Ryan</HI> ac|quainted them, that as he could not ima|gine there was any thing in the Play they could except again&s;t, he was appre|hen&s;ive he had the Misfortune to di&s;|plea&s;e them. Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> then came on, and told them he found the Hou&s;e was divided, and as the Majority was for hearing the Play, he hop'd tho&s;e who were not, would go out. The Hou&s;e on that were unanimous, and cry'd, <HI>Turn them out, Turn them out,</HI> but they &s;aved the Audience the Trouble of doing it, and retired under the general Hi&s;s of every Per&s;on then pre&s;ent: After which the Play went on without the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The Author having reflected that Malice, tho' it could do the Play no Hurt, might affect Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> by keeping Per|&s;ons
<PB REF="8">
from the Hou&s;e, who have no great Reli&s;h for Noi&s;e, cho&s;e rather to di&s;|continue the further acting of the Play, and to refer him&s;elf to the Judgment of every impartial Reader, to whom he freely commits it, being determin'd as frankly to acknowledge any real Fault found with it, as to ju&s;tify it, if cen&s;ur'd without Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Author cannot conclude, without declaring how much he thinks him&s;elf obliged to every Actor for the Care taken in the acting it, and more particularly to tho&s;e who having the principal Parts to perform, had an Opportunity to exert them&s;elves, as they did, in the mo&s;t &s;a|tisfactory Manner.</P>

<L>WHEN Love's taught Dangers animate the Stage,</L>
<L>Your Ears, ye Fair! let the &s;oft Scenes engage:</L>
<L>Let each bright Li&s;t'ner mark the Wiles we &s;how,</L>
<L>And catch dumb Caution, from the pictur'd Woe.</L>
<L>&mdash;Guiltle&s;s of Farce, to Night, the meaning Player</L>
<L>Courts not your Laughter&mdash;but, alarms your Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Man, the Deceiver! veils his cruel Art:</L>
<L>And &s;kreens him&s;elf, within th' attempted Heart.</L>
<L>There, to ungenerous Empire, climbs, ere long:</L>
<L>Help'd by the Confidence, he means to wrong!</L>
<L>&mdash;This, to detect, we act his Fal&s;hood o'er:</L>
<L>And, the Deluder, known, betrays no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, the be&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Comick Mu&s;e!</L>
<L>Love has a thou&s;and Le&s;&s;ons, to infu&s;e:</L>
<L>&mdash;Not always Lightne&s;s &s;hou'd ungrace the Scene.&mdash;</L>
<L>To laugh at Folly, but indulges Spleen.</L>
<L>Coxcombs, and Fops, in harmle&s;s Error &s;tray:</L>
<L>And trip, undangerous out of Pa&s;&s;ion's Way.</L>
<L>Mi&s;ers, and Sots, le&s;s, Mirth, than Pity, move:</L>
<L>And, Dullne&s;s brings an Antidote, for Love.</L>
<L>&mdash;But, there's a Traitor, arm'd, in am'rous Mail!</L>
<L>Born, to attempt, and, fa&s;hion'd to prevail!</L>
<L>Di&s;guis'd in Softne&s;s&mdash;by deep Arts endear'd:</L>
<L>And, always dang'rous&mdash;becau&s;e, never fear'd.</L>

Him, in our Gla&s;s of Life, to Night, we &s;how:</L>
<L>Nor &s;toop the conde&s;cending Scene, too low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence, if too grave, for Comedy, we &s;eem,</L>
<L>Think us but &s;uited to our &s;erious Theme.&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;'Tis no light Lo&s;s, when charming Woman falls!</L>
<L>On our Defence, the Sex's Merit calls.&mdash;</L>
<L>We, who the Pictures of a World impart,</L>
<L>Neglect not what concerns its faire&s;t Part.</L>
<L>All Danger, to that Sex, thus frankly &s;hown,</L>
<L>At the &s;ame Time, does Honour to our own.</L>

<L>Nor let Neglect of Laughter move the Pit,</L>
<L>To dread, in Con&s;equence, a Dearth of Wit.</L>
<L>Unmeaning <HI>Mirth</HI> may live, in empty Noi&s;e:</L>
<L>But, &s;olid <HI>Conver&s;e</HI> &s;wells our &s;ofter Joys.</L>
<L>&mdash;Once, in an Age of Tumbling, Dance, and Song,</L>

<L>Fir&s;t, <HI>Maidens!</HI> let my &s;ad Example teach ye,</L>

<L>They move more Sorrow, than a dying Woman!</L>
<L>And, Sighs, and Prayers, are be&s;t, when made in private,</L>
<L>As you all know, who have good Ends to drive at.</L>

<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> I thought the Time long on many Accounts. But will you forgive me an abrupt Que&s;tion? Was not that your Si&s;ter that left you, as I came up? I got a Glimp&s;e as &s;he &s;hot along, and thought it was that dear Figure, who&s;e Re&s;emblance, &s;till fre&s;h in my Memory, during my Retirement, ever kept me Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeed. But &s;he was not well dre&s;s'd enough; &s;he wanted a Pin, or a Patch, I &s;uppo&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch important Matter. A fooli&s;h Maxim in the Sex, <HI>Ned,</HI> always to ap|pear to the be&s;t Advantage before Marriage. It makes the Difference but too &s;en&s;ible after, when we &s;ee and feel the Neglect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Rea&s;on of her going was however kind. But tell me, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> are you a little more reconcil'd to old <HI>England</HI> than you was, when we la&s;t parted? Have our pretty Country|women made any Impre&s;&s;ion on your Heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Heart, <HI>Ned,</HI> was ever &s;oft, and will, like Wax, as ea&s;ily take as lo&s;e an Impre&s;|&s;ion. But I'm &s;uch a Convert to my Country|women's Charms, that I think they want nothing but a little more Gaiety and Life to make them as much more agreeable, as they are already more beautiful than tho&s;e of other Nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;omething. I am pleas'd to &s;ee you can do Ju&s;tice to your own Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, dear <HI>Ned,</HI> for once lay a&s;ide thy Partiality to thy own Country. Look upon thy&s;elf as a Foreigner. That done, ob&s;erve our charming Countrywomen, at a Vi&s;it or a Play; &s;ee how they &s;it with their Hands rivetted to their
<PB N="5" REF="20">
Fans, and plac'd ju&s;t in the Centre of their pretty Per&s;ons; motionle&s;s, unle&s;s it be to di&s;play the Furbelows of that little Engine, and as &s;ilent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the fir&s;t that ever complain'd of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd have 'em &s;peak in every Ge&s;ture. Give me a Woman, who&s;e very Air and Manner &s;peak, and are a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion that they have&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have&mdash;what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? Why as much Inclination as Power to charm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you found none &s;uch? How did Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI>'s Lady prove? I think I left you hot in that charitable Pur&s;uit. I don't expect to find you &s;o now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, <HI>Ned,</HI> it wou'd be odd if you did. A beautiful Woman is like a well-wrote Book, every Leaf you turn over, at fir&s;t affords new Plea&s;ure; but when you're forc'd to read it daily, from one End to the other, you'll find but little Inclination to begin again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're witty, Sir. But is this Argument only to hold good for the Men? Have not Women the &s;ame Plea for Incon&s;tancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Friend! That it was but &s;o! How happy &s;hould we be! But there's a Fatality in the Way of loving, of the two Sexes, that renders both mi&s;erable. Enjoyment le&s;&s;ens our Pa&s;&s;ion, and increa&s;es theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you was &s;ucce&s;sful? And now, like a re&s;tle&s;s Tyrant, de&s;pi&s;e your Conque&s;t, and &s;eek for new Acqui&s;itions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Succe&s;sful! Ay, that I was, to tell you a Secret, long before hone&s;t Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI> took a Bargain off my Hands, that began to puzzle me a little how to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir <HI>Harry!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>In few Words then, thus: Lady <HI>Traf|fick,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="21">
then <HI>Lucia Bellfa&s;t,</HI> old Colonel <HI>Bellfa&s;t</HI>'s Daughter, was very pretty, I very amorous. Our Neighbourhood gave me many Opportunities of &s;eeing her, which I improv'd, till at la&s;t I found my&s;elf tenderly beloved. I caught the Infection too, and doated on her; promi&s;ed Marriage; which I intended to execute. The Saints in Hea|ven, and her Maid, were Witne&s;&s;es to my Vows. <HI>Lucia</HI> thought the Security good, and delivered into my Arms the lovelie&s;t Per&s;on they had ever held. With Joy we often met, and with Reluc|tance parted, cur&s;ing the Day that came &s;o &s;oon, and oblig'd me to di&s;appear, before any of the Family was up, but the tru&s;ty Maid. Much about this Time Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI> came down to <HI>Lucia</HI>'s Fa|ther, fell in Love with the Daughter, a&s;k'd her of him, and obtain'd her. She wou'd have declar'd our Affair, to avoid a Match &s;he hated, and to have been mine, as I had promis'd; but having no great Stomach to the Match, and finding &s;he wou'd not &s;uffer in her Reputation by the Affair, I advis'd her to accept the Gentleman's Offer, in &s;uch a Manner, that &s;he &s;aw &s;he mu&s;t, or be un|done. I own 'twas unkind.&mdash;She did not &s;ee me for a long Time after &s;he was married, and, I believe, never wou'd, had not her Hu&s;band's Affairs call'd him abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o, not content with forcing this fond Creature to give her Vows to a Man &s;he hated, you forc'd her too, to violate tho&s;e very Vows, and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Ned,</HI> not &s;o fa&s;t. I did all I cou'd, indeed, but &s;he was ob&s;tinate, and never wou'd. It was in vain to alledge former Intima|cies; &s;he wept, and an&s;wer'd me with her Hu&s;band, her Hu&s;band, at ever Word. Is it not odd, <HI>Ned,</HI> a Woman &s;hou'd be con&s;tant to a Man &s;he hates, and refu&s;e one &s;he loves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="22">
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;o to you. But People that think there is &s;omething be&s;ide Pa&s;&s;ion, that ought to be li&s;ten'd to, may, perhaps, be of a different Opinion. But now you mention her Hu&s;band, pray what's become of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gone! What do you mean, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why gone&mdash;Gone to Heaven, Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>What dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir.&mdash;And the generous, good|natur'd Creature, left his Widow all he had: If he had not, it would have been a heavy Tax on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas generous indeed. I heard he was a worthy Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, too worthy to make a Cuckold of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, be &s;erious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, in few Words,&mdash;her Hu&s;band, Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI>'s private Affairs, oblig'd him to go to <HI>Leghorn.</HI> The&s;e very private Affairs oblig'd him to leave that Place &s;oon after, and make a &s;hort Voyage. Short, indeed, it was; for the Ship and Crew were all ca&s;t away on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> near <HI>Sallee.</HI> Like a prudent Man, he had made his Will before he went, and thus my Lady <HI>Traffick</HI> became a young and rich Widow. Now, <HI>Ned,</HI> you know a Woman can't hold out for ever again&s;t a Man &s;he loves. Her Hu&s;band's Death left her without any Excu&s;e, and her own Heart pleaded &s;trongly for me. Then &s;he hop'd too to make me more than ever fond, and like a fond Fool marry her. She took the wrong Method.&mdash;However our Commerce, which now I am very &s;orry for, was renewed again; again &s;he tru&s;ted me, and was again deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;oon cool!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be tir'd of an Angel, unle&s;s &s;he cou'd vary her Form. Like <HI>Ovid,</HI> I'm for the
<PB N="8" REF="23">
black, the fair, the plump, the lean, the tall, the &s;hort. All, all.&mdash;To be plain, I never &s;aw a Woman, but had &s;omething plea&s;ing in her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still wild and incon&s;tant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, faith. And when I grow other|wi&s;e, it mu&s;t be for a very bad Rea&s;on. Why, Sir, to &s;hew you what a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s I am, I have at pre&s;ent an honourable Affair upon my Hands, which does not hinder me from amu&s;ing my&s;elf with my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Woman.</P>

<P>But who is it that has kindled this honour|able Flame in your Brea&s;t?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>One that might warm a Hermit's frozen Brea&s;t. <HI>Angelina.</HI></P>

<P>My Lord <HI>Lovewell</HI>'s Daughter. I think &s;he's an only Child. She mu&s;t be rich.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, &s;he wants for nothing. Then, Sir, I have, which with all my Soul I wi&s;h I had not, this Lady <HI>Traffick,</HI> as trouble&s;ome as a Dun. when a Man has nothing to pay.&mdash;But this does not hinder me from laying clo&s;e Siege to another, who is on the Point of dropping into my Arms, Young and pretty as an Angel.</P>

<P>Why, faith, <HI>Ned,</HI> I am a little puzzled as to that, I have not Ill-nature enough to for|&s;ake her, nor Complai&s;ance enough to for&s;ake my Plea&s;ures for her. She knows my Love is at its lowe&s;t Ebb; and that there is little left but Grati|tude to keep it alive. And &s;ince that Time, what have I not &s;uffer'd? To give you a Sketch of my Life with her, Each Day I &s;ee her, and each Day am regularly entertain'd with the &s;ame Reproaches.&mdash;I hear my&s;elf accus'd as Author of her Ruin; my own Words, Words, which at certain Mo|ments in my fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion's Heat, or when com|pell'd by the fond Que&s;tion, <HI>Do you love, and will you ever love me?&mdash;</HI>Words, which, indeed, I may have &s;aid, quoted back and retorted as &s;o many Proofs of my Incon&s;tancy. In &s;hort, my Temper's quite broke, quite wearied out with &s;truggling. Neither Company nor Friends divert me. Were I to con&s;ult her Humour, I &s;hould never be from her. When I but mi&s;s a Day, there's no End of her upbraiding.

<P>I have not done yet. I heard you out, now hear me. I'll grant you, a Chambermaid lo&s;es her Character the other Way; but if &s;he has any Beauty, and Wit to make the mo&s;t of it, it will go hard if &s;he do not make it worth her while. And Money, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> you know, hides a great many Faults. Then the Elegancies of Life wipe away a Spot in one's Character; or at lea&s;t make one bear with it. Good Cloaths, Meat, Drink, Diver&s;ions! To ri&s;e from a low State to an Affluence of Fortune and Plea&s;ure, at lea&s;t to her. Oh! the Joy's not to be de&s;crib'd, one mu&s;t feel it. After all, one can at la&s;t match with one's Equal. He'll be glad to have us, if we bring our Welcome with us. He won't be &s;o nice as to refu&s;e a hand&s;ome Suit of Cloaths, becau&s;e it has been a little &s;oil'd; and we may, perhaps, be enabled to carry on a genteeler Profe&s;&s;ion than a Chandler's Shop.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Experience, Madam, is the Mother of true Judgment. Tho&s;e fine Gentlemen you mention, are either too young to judge right, or too much hurried by their Pa&s;&s;ions, which For|tune enables 'em to indulge to Exce&s;s, to follow what is right.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t, however, give a thinking Wo|man &s;ome Pain, to find even Men of Sen&s;e can't value them as they ought, till they are &s;ated with Plea&s;ures, and have lo&s;t their Reli&s;h for them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Education of our Sex, &s;o diffe|rent from that of yours, gives us &s;uch early and unbounded Liberties, that a thinking Woman mu&s;t look with Indulgence on our early Failings; e&s;pecially, &s;ince we are the principal Sufferers, in neglecting real Happine&s;s to follow the Phan|tom.</P>

<P>Madam, 'tis to you I now &s;peak. I told you of a Promi&s;e of Marriage from Sir <HI>Harry</HI> to me, made in early Youth. As we were both too young to judge of Happine&s;s when that Vow was made, I here acquit him of his Promi&s;e, and withdraw my own. He is now free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is too much; I'll never be outdone in Genero&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Lucia,</HI> you have indeed reveng'd your&s;elf. This generous Action will never be for|got, nor ever be remember'd, but with Pain.</P>
<STAGE>[Turns to Ang.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir. True Happine&s;s mu&s;t be with|out Alloy. I &s;hall never think of this Lady, but I &s;hall look upon my&s;elf as a Bar to her Peace of Mind. And tho' thro' Exce&s;s of Goodne&s;s, which very Goodne&s;s &s;hou'd confound you, &s;he can give up her Happine&s;s to procure that of the Man by whom &s;he's ruin'd, I never can con&s;ent, and never will. Your Rea&s;on, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> points the Path you have to follow, mine, which I am to avoid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Traf.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Sentiment, Madam, is kind and generous. But my Mi&s;ery or Happine&s;s mu&s;t henceforward depend upon my&s;elf alone; and I, Madam, will never be his. He is free.&mdash;Here, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> is your Letter. I could almo&s;t wi&s;h I had never &s;een it; but &s;ince I have, let me beg you never to &s;ee that Per&s;on more. Her Pa&s;&s;ion is but young; &s;he yet may conquer it, if you avoid &s;eeing her.</P>

<P>Take Comfort, Madam. There are but few that know this fatal Secret. Believe me, Ma|dam, as delicate a Sen&s;e of Virtue as I have, I do acquit you. Have Patience, you may yet be happy.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady Traf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be govern'd by you. Your Leave, Madam, at pre&s;ent to retire. I am unfit to &s;tay.</P>

<P>No, faith, Sir: And to prove that I have no Preten&s;ion to her, if this Lady, &s;ince you have told her &s;he mu&s;t not think of you, were in|clin'd to believe &s;he has Charms enough to re|claim me&mdash;</P>

<P>I have a Man that has &s;erv'd me long and faithfully. The Way of Life I am now going into, renders his Service u&s;ele&s;s to me. I long in|tended him a Farm of forty Pounds a Year.

<P>Well, <HI>Tom,</HI> if thou art but as good as thy Word, I promi&s;e thee thou &s;halt reap the Fruits of No-body's Labour but thy own. But take heed.
