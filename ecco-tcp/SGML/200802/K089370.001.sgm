<HEAD>To the Editor of the Piece intitled, <HI>PAMELA;</HI> or, <HI>VIRTUE Rewarded.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure in the Per|u&s;al of your PAMELA. It intirely an&s;wers the Character you give of it in your Preface; nor have you &s;aid one Word too much in Commen|dation of a Piece that has Advantages and Excel|lencies peculiar to it&s;elf. For, be&s;ides the beautiful Simplicity of the Style, and a happy Propriety and Clearne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion (the Letters being written under the immediate Impre&s;&s;ion of every Circum|&s;tance which occa&s;ioned them, and that to tho&s;e who had a Right to know the fair Writer's mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts) the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be more affectingly de&s;cribed, and Nature may be traced in her undi&s;gui&s;ed Inclina|tions with much more Propriety and Exactne&s;s, than can po&s;&s;ibly be found in a Detail of Actions long pa&s;t, which are never recollected with the &s;ame Affections, Hopes, and Dreads, with which they were felt when they occurred.</P>
<P>This little Book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto much-wanted Standard or Pattern for this Kind of Writing. For it abounds with lively Images and Pictures; with Incidents natural, &s;ur|pri&s;ing, and perfectly adapted to the Story; with Circum&s;tances intere&s;ting to Per&s;ons in common
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Life, as well as to tho&s;e in exalted Stations. The greate&s;t Regard is every where paid in it to Decency, and to every Duty of Life: There is a con&s;tant Fit|ne&s;s of the Style to the Per&s;ons and Characters de|&s;cribed; Plea&s;ure and In&s;truction here always go hand in hand: Vice and Virtue are &s;et in con&s;tant Oppo&s;ition, and Religion every-where inculcated in its native Beauty and chearful Amiablene&s;s; not dre&s;&s;ed up in &s;tiff, melancholy, or gloomy Forms, on one hand, nor yet, on the other, deba&s;ed below its due Dignity and noble Requi&s;ites, in Compliment to a too fa&s;hionable but depraved Ta&s;te. And this I will boldly &s;ay, that if its numerous Beauties are added to its excellent Tendency, it will be found worthy a Place, not only in all Families (e&s;pecially &s;uch as have in them young Per&s;ons of either Sex) but in the Collections of the mo&s;t curious and polite Readers. For, as it borrows none of its Excellencies from the romantic Flights of unnatural Fancy, its being founded in Truth and Nature, and built upon Experience, will be a la&s;ting Recommendation to the Di&s;cerning and Judicious; while the agreeable Variety of Occurrences and Characters, in which it abounds, will not fail to engage the Attention of the gay and more &s;prightly Readers.</P>
<P>The moral Reflections and U&s;es to be drawn from the &s;everal Parts of this admirable Hi&s;tory, are &s;o happily deduced from a Croud of different Events and Characters, in the Conclu&s;ion of the Work, that I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s on that Head. But I think, the Hints you have given me, &s;hould al&s;o prefatorily be given to the Publick; <HI>viz.</HI> That it will appear from &s;everal Things mentioned in the Letters, that the Story mu&s;t have happened within the&s;e Thirty Years pa&s;t: That you have been obliged to vary &s;ome of the Names of Per&s;ons, Places, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to di&s;gui&s;e a few of the Circum&s;tances, in order to avoid giving Offence
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
to &s;ome Per&s;ons, who would not chu&s;e to be point|ed out too plainly in it; tho' they would be glad it may do the Good &s;o laudably intended by the Publi|cation. And as you have in Confidence &s;ubmitted to my Opinion &s;ome of tho&s;e Variations, I am much plea&s;ed that you have &s;o managed the Matter, as to make no Alteration in the Facts; and, at the &s;ame time, have avoided the digre&s;&s;ive Prolixity too fre|quently u&s;ed on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Little Book, charming PAMELA! face the World, and never doubt of finding Friends and Admirers, not only in thine own Country, but far from Home; where thou may&s;t give an Example of Purity to the Writers of a neighbouring Nation; which now &s;hall have an Opportunity to receive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bullion in Exchange for its own Dro&s;s, which has &s;o long pa&s;&s;ed current among us in Pieces abounding with all the Levities of its volatile Inhabitants. The reigning Depravity of the Times has yet left Virtue many Votaries. Of their Protection you need not de&s;pair. May every head-&s;trong Libertine who&s;e Hands you reach, be reclaimed; and every tempted Virgin who reads you, imitate the Virtue, and meet the Reward of the high-meriting, tho' low-de&s;cended, PAMELA. I am, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>To my worthy Friend, the Editor of PAMELA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN the Manu&s;cript of <HI>Pamela</HI> by the Bearer, which I have read with a great deal of Plea&s;ure. It is written with that Spirit of Truth and agreeable Simplicity, which, tho' much wanted, is &s;eldom found in tho&s;e Pieces which are calculated for the Entertainment and In&s;tru|ction of the Publick. It carries Conviction in every Part of it; and the Incidents are &s;o natural and intere&s;ting, that I have gone hand-in-hand, and &s;ympathiz'd with the pretty Heroine in all her Sufferings, and been extremely anxious for her Safety, under the Apprehen&s;ions of the bad Con|&s;equences which I expected, every Page, would en&s;ue from the laudable Re&s;i&s;tance &s;he made. I have intere&s;ted my&s;elf in all her Schemes of E&s;cape; been alternately pleas'd and angry with her in her Re&s;traint; <HI>pleas'd</HI> with the little Machinations and Contrivances &s;he &s;et on foot for her Relea&s;e, and <HI>angry</HI> for &s;uffering her Fears to defeat them; always lamenting, with a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Concern, the Mi&s;|carriages of her Hopes and Projects. In &s;hort, the whole is &s;o affecting, that there is no reading it without uncommon Concern and Emotion. Thus far only as to the <HI>Entertainment</HI> it gives.</P>
<P>As to <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> the Piece is full of both. It &s;hews Virtue in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, and renders the Practice of it amiable and lovely.
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
The beautiful Sufferer keeps it ever in her View, without the lea&s;t O&s;tentation, or Pride; &s;he has it &s;o &s;trongly implanted in her, that thro' the whole Cour&s;e of her Sufferings, &s;he does not &s;o much as he&s;itate once, whether &s;he &s;hall &s;acrifice it to Li|berty and Ambition, or not; but, as if there were no other way to free and &s;ave her&s;elf, carries on a determin'd Purpo&s;e to per&s;evere in her Innocence, and wade with it throughout all Difficulties and Temptations, or peri&s;h under them. It is an a&s;toni&s;h|ing Matter, and well worth our mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;i|deration, that a young beautiful Girl, in the low Scene of Life and Circum&s;tance in which Fortune placed her, without the Advantage of a Friend capa|ble to relieve and protect her, or any other Educa|tion than what occurr'd to her from her own Ob&s;ervation and little Reading, in the Cour&s;e of her Attendance on her excellent Mi&s;tre&s;s and Benefactre&s;s, could, after having a Ta&s;te of Ea&s;e and Plenty in a higher Sphere of Life than what &s;he was born and fir&s;t brought up in, re&s;olve to return to her primi|tive Poverty, rather than give up her Innocence, I &s;ay, it is &s;urpri&s;ing, that a young Per&s;on, &s;o circum|&s;tanced, could, in Contempt of proffer'd Grandeur on the one &s;ide, and in Defiance of Penury on the other, &s;o happily and prudently conduct her&s;elf thro' &s;uch a Series of Perplexities and Troubles, and with|&s;tand the alluring Baits, and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible Offers of a fine Gentleman, &s;o univer&s;ally admired and e&s;teemed, for the Agreeablene&s;s of his Per&s;on and good Qualities, among all his Acquaintance; defeat all his Mea&s;ures with &s;o much Addre&s;s, and oblige him, at la&s;t, to give over his vain Pur&s;uit, and &s;acri|fice his Pride and Ambition to Virtue, and become the Protector of that Innocence which he &s;o long and &s;o indefatigably labour'd to &s;upplant: And all this without ever having entertain'd the lea&s;t previ|ous
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
De&s;ign or Thought for that Purpo&s;e: No Art u&s;ed to inflame him, no Coquetry practi&s;ed to tempt or intice him, and no Prudery or Affectation to tamper with his Pa&s;&s;ions; but, on the contrary, art|le&s;s and unpracti&s;ed in the Wiles of the World, all her Endeavours, and even all her Wi&s;hes, tended only to render her&s;elf as un-amiable as &s;he could in his Eyes: Tho' at the &s;ame time &s;he is &s;o far from having any Aver&s;ion to his Per&s;on, that &s;he &s;eems rather prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in his Favour, and admires his Excellencies, whil&s;t &s;he condemns his Pa&s;&s;ion for her. A glorious In&s;tance of Self-denial! Thus her very Repul&s;es became Attractions: The more &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, the more &s;he charm'd; and the very Means &s;he u&s;ed to guard her Virtue, the more endanger'd it, by inflaming his Pa&s;&s;ions: Till, at la&s;t, by Per&s;e|verance, and a brave and re&s;olute Defence, the Be|&s;ieged not only obtain'd a glorious Victory over the Be&s;ieger, but took him Pri&s;oner too.</P>
<P>I am charmed with the beautiful Reflections &s;he makes in the Cour&s;e of her Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; her Solilo|quies and little Rea&s;onings with her&s;elf, are exceeding pretty and entertaining: She pours out all her Soul in them before her Parents without Di&s;gui&s;e; &s;o that one may judge of, nay, almo&s;t &s;ee, the inmo&s;t Re|ce&s;&s;es of her Mind. A pure clear Fountain of Truth and Innocence; a Magazine of Virtue and unblemi&s;h'd Thoughts!</P>
<P>I can't conceive why you &s;hould he&s;itate a Mo|ment as to the Publication of this very natural and uncommon Piece. I could wi&s;h to &s;ee it out in its own native Simplicity, which will affect and plea&s;e the Reader beyond all the Strokes of Ora|tory in the World; for tho&s;e will but &s;poil it: and, &s;hould you permit &s;uch a murdering Hand to be laid upon it, to glo&s;s and tinge it over with &s;uper|fluous and needle&s;s Decorations, which, like too
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
much Drapery in Sculpture and Statuary, will but encumber it; it may di&s;gui&s;e the Facts, mar the Reflections, and unnaturalize the Incidents, &s;o as to be lo&s;t in a Multiplicity of fine idle Words and Phra&s;es, and reduce our Sterling Sub&s;tance into an empty Shadow, or rather <HI>frenchify</HI> our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> So|lidity into Froth and Whip-&s;yllabub. No; let us have <HI>Pamela</HI> as <HI>Pamela</HI> wrote it; in her own Words, without Amputation, or Addition. Produce her to us in her neat Country Apparel, &s;uch as &s;he appear'd in, on her intended Departure to her Parents; for &s;uch be&s;t becomes her Innocence, and beautiful Simplicity. Such a Dre&s;s will be&s;t edify and enter|tain. The flowing Robes of Oratory may indeed amu&s;e and amaze, but will never &s;trike the Mind with &s;olid Attention.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, a Piece of this Kind is much want|ed in the World, which is but too much, as well as too early, debauched by pernicious <HI>Novels.</HI> I know nothing Entertaining of that Kind that one might venture to recommend to the Peru&s;al (much le&s;s the Imitation) of the Youth of either Sex: All that I have hitherto read, tends only to corrupt their Principles, mi&s;lead their Judgments, and initiate them into Gallantry, and loo&s;e Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Publi&s;h then, this good, this edifying and in&s;tru|ctive little Piece for their &s;akes. The Honour of <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Sex demands <HI>Pamela</HI> at your Hands, to &s;hew the World an Heroine, almo&s;t beyond Exam|ple, in an unu&s;ual Scene of Life, whom no Tempta|tions, or Sufferings, could &s;ubdue. It is a fine, and glorious Original, for the Fair to copy out and imi|tate. Our own Sex, too, require it of you, to free us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from the Imputation of being incapable of the Impre&s;&s;ions of Virtue and Honour; and to &s;hew the Ladies, that we are not inflexible while they are &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="13">In &s;hort, the Cau&s;e of Virtue calls for the Pub|lication of &s;uch a Piece as this. Oblige then, Sir, the concurrent Voices of both Sexes, and give us <HI>Pamela</HI> for the Benefit of Mankind: And as I be|lieve its Excellencies cannot be long unknown to the World, and that there will not be a Family with|out it; &s;o I make no Doubt but every Family that has it, will be much improv'd and better'd by it. 'Twill form the tender Minds of <HI>Youth</HI> for the Reception and Practice of Virtue and Honour; con|firm and e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e of <HI>maturer Years</HI> on good and &s;teady Principles; reclaim the Vicious, and mend the Age in general; in&s;omuch that as I doubt not <HI>Pamela</HI> will become the bright Example and Imita|tion of all the fa&s;hionable young Ladies of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; &s;o the truly generous Benefactor and Re|warder of her exemplary Virtue, will be no le&s;s ad|mired and imitated among the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> of our own Sex.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE kind Reception which this Piece has met with from the Publick, (a large Impre&s;&s;ion having been carried off in le&s;s than Three Months) de|&s;erves not only Acknowledgment, but that &s;ome Notice &s;hould be taken of the Objections that have hitherto come to hand again&s;t a few Pa&s;&s;ages in it, that &s;o the Work may be rendered as unexceptionable as po&s;&s;ible, and, of con&s;equence, the fitter to an&s;wer the general De&s;ign of it; which is to promote Virtue, and cultivate the Minds of the Youth of both Sexes.</P>
<P>But Difficulties having ari&s;en from the different Opinions of Gentlemen, &s;ome of whom applauded the very Things that others found Fault with, it was thought proper to &s;ubmit the Whole to the Judgment of a Gentleman of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd Ta&s;te and Abilities; the Re&s;ult of which will be &s;een in the &s;ub&s;equent Pages.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have agreeably deceiv'd me into a Sur|prize, which it will be as hard to ex|pre&s;s, as the Beauties of PAMELA. Though I open'd this powerful little Piece with more Expe|ctation than from common De&s;igns, of like Pro|mi&s;e, becau&s;e it came from <HI>your</HI> Hands, for my <HI>Daughters,</HI> yet, who could have dreamt, he &s;hould find, under the mode&s;t Di&s;gui&s;e of a <HI>Novel,</HI> all the <HI>Soul</HI> of Religion, Good-breeding, Di&s;cretion, Good-nature, Wit, Fancy, Fine Thought, and Morality? &mdash;I have done nothing but read it to others, and hear others again read it, to me, ever &s;ince it came into my Hands; and I find I am likely to do nothing el&s;e, for I know not how long yet to come: becau&s;e, if I lay the Book down, it comes after me.&mdash;When it has dwelt all Day long upon the Ear, It takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all Night, of the Fancy. &mdash;It has Witchcraft in every Page of it: but it is the Witchcraft of Pa&s;&s;ion and Meaning. Who is there that will not de&s;pi&s;e the fal&s;e, empty <HI>Pomp</HI> of the Poets, when he ob&s;erves in this little, unpre|tending, mild Triumph of <HI>Nature,</HI> the whole Force of Invention and Genius, creating new Powers of Emotion, and tran&s;planting <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> into that unweeded low Garden the

<HI>Heart,</HI> from the dry and &s;harp <HI>Summit</HI> of <HI>Rea|&s;on?</HI></P>
<P>YET, I confe&s;s, there is <HI>One,</HI> in the World, of whom I think with &s;till greater Re&s;pect, than of PAMELA: and That is, of the wonderful AUTHOR of PAMELA. &mdash; Pray, Who is he, Dear Sir? and where, and how, has he been able to hide, hitherto, &s;uch an encircling and all-ma&s;tering Spirit? He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every Quality that ART could have charm'd by: yet, has lent it to, and conceal'd it in. NATURE. &mdash; The Compre|hen&s;ivene&s;s of his Imagination mu&s;t be truly prodi|gious! &mdash;It has &s;tretch'd out this diminutive mere <HI>Grain</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;tard-&s;eed,</HI> (a poor Girl's little, inno|cent, Story) into a Re&s;emblance of That <HI>Heaven,</HI> which the Be&s;t of Good Books has compar'd it to. &mdash;All. the Pa&s;&s;ions are His, in their mo&s;t clo&s;e and ab&s;tracted Rece&s;&s;es: and by &s;electing the mo&s;t delicate, and yet, at the &s;ame time, mo&s;t powerful, of their Springs, thereby to act, wind, and manage, the Heart, He <HI>moves</HI> us, every where, with the Force of a TRAGEDY.</P>
<P>WHAT is there, throughout the <HI>Whole,</HI> that I do not &s;incerely admire! &mdash; I admire, in it, the &s;trong di&s;tingui&s;h'd Variety, and picture&s;que glow|ing Likene&s;s to <HI>Life,</HI> of the Characters. I know, hear, &s;ee, and live among 'em All: and, if I cou'd paint, cou'd return you their <HI>Faces.</HI> I admire, in it, the noble Simplicity, Force, Aptne&s;s, and Truth, of &s;o many mode&s;t, oeconomical, moral, prudential, religious, &s;atirical, and cautionary, <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI>; which are introduc'd with &s;uch &s;ea&s;onable Dexterity, and with &s;o poli&s;h'd and exqui&s;ite a Delicacy, of Expre&s;&s;ion and Sentiment, that I am only apprehen&s;ive, for the <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Virtue,</HI> le&s;t &s;ome of the <HI>fine&s;t,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t touching,</HI> of tho&s;e

<P>ONE of the be&s;t-judg'd Peculiars, of the Plan, is, that The&s;e In&s;tructions being convey'd, as in a Kind of Dramatical Repre&s;entation, by tho&s;e beau|tiful <HI>Scenes,</HI> Her own Letters and Journals, who acts the mo&s;t moving and &s;uffering <HI>Part,</HI> we feel the Force in a threefold Effect,&mdash;from the Motive, the Act, and the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>BUT what, above All, I am charm'd with, is the amiable <HI>Good-nature</HI> of the AUTHOR, who, I am convinc'd, has one of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t gene|rous Hearts, of Mankind: becau&s;e, mi&s;-mea&s;uring <HI>other</HI> Minds, by <HI>His Own,</HI> he can draw Every thing, to Perfection, but <HI>Wickedne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; I became inextricably in <HI>Love</HI> with this delightful Defect of his Malice;&mdash;for, I found it owing to an <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> in his <HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI> Only ob&s;erve, Sir, with what <HI>virtu|ous Reluctance</HI> he complies with the Demands of his Story, when he &s;tands in need of &s;ome blame|able Characters. Tho' his Judgment compels him to mark 'em with di&s;agreeable Colourings, &s;o that they make an odious Appearance at fir&s;t, He can't forbear, by an unexpected and gradual Decline from Them&s;elves, to &s;often and tran&s;mute all the Hor|ror conceiv'd for their Ba&s;ene&s;s, till we are arriv'd, through in&s;en&s;ible Stages, at an Inclination to for|give it intirely.</P>
<P>I MUST venture to add, without mincing the matter, what I really believe, of this Book. &mdash; It will live on, through Po&s;terity, with &s;uch unbounded Extent of Good Con&s;equences, that
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
Twenty Ages to come may be the Better and Wi&s;er, for its Influence. It will &s;teal fir&s;t, imper|ceptibly, into the Hearts of the <HI>Young</HI> and the <HI>Tender:</HI> where It will afterwards guide and mode|rate their Reflections and Re&s;olves, when grown Older. And, &s;o, a gradual moral Sun&s;hine, of un-au&s;tere and compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Virtue,</HI> &s;hall break out upon the <HI>World,</HI> from this TRIFLE (for &s;uch, I dare an&s;wer for the <HI>Author,</HI> His Mode&s;ty mi&s;|guides him to think it).&mdash; No Applau&s;e therefore can be too <HI>high,</HI> for <HI>&s;uch Merit.</HI> And, let me abominate the contemptible <HI>Re&s;erves of mean-&s;pi|rited Men,</HI> who while they but <HI>he&s;itate</HI> their E&s;teem, with Re&s;traint, can be fluent and un|check'd in their <HI>Envy.</HI>&mdash; In an Age &s;o deficient in Goodne&s;s, Every &s;uch Virtue, as That of this Author, is a &s;alutary <HI>Angel,</HI> in <HI>Sodom.</HI> And <HI>One</HI> who cou'd &s;toop to conceal, a Delight he receives from the <HI>Worthy,</HI> wou'd be equally capable of &s;ub|mitting to an Approbation of the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Wicked.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS thinking, ju&s;t now, as I return'd from a <HI>Walk</HI> in the <HI>Snow,</HI> on that <HI>Old Roman Policy,</HI> of Exemptions in Favour of Men, who had given a few, bodily, Children to the Republick.&mdash;What &s;uperior Di&s;tinction ought <HI>our</HI> Country to find (but that <HI>Policy</HI> and <HI>We</HI> are at Variance) for Re|ward of this <HI>Father, of Millions of</HI> MINDS, which are to owe new Formation to the future Effect of his Influence!</P>
<P>UPON the whole, as I never met with &s;o plea&s;|ing, &s;o hone&s;t, and &s;o truly de&s;erving a Book, I &s;hou'd never have done, if I explain'd All my Rea|&s;ons for admiring its Author.&mdash;If it is not a <HI>Secret,</HI> oblige me &s;o far as to tell me his <HI>Name:</HI> for &s;ince I feel him the <HI>Friend</HI> of my Soul, it would be a

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'&mdash;NO Sentiments which I have here, or in my la&s;t, expre&s;s'd, of the &s;weet <HI>Pamela,</HI> being more than the bare Truth, which every Man mu&s;t feel, who lends his Ear to the inchanting Prattler, why does the Author's Mo|de&s;ty mi&s;lead his Judgment, to &s;u&s;pect the Style wants Poli&s;hing? &mdash;No, Sir, there is an <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> a <HI>natural Air,</HI> a dignify'd <HI>Simplicity,</HI> and mea&s;ured Fullne&s;s, in it, that, re&s;embling Life, outglows it!

Remember, tho' &s;he put it on with hum|ble Pro&s;pect, of de&s;cending to the Level of her Purpo&s;e, it <HI>adorn'd</HI> her, with &s;uch unpre&s;um'd <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of Loveline&s;s; &s;at with &s;uch neat Pro|priety of Elegant Neglect about her, that it threw out All her Charms, with tenfold, and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Influence.&mdash;And &s;o, dear Sir, it will be always found.&mdash;When mode&s;t Beauty &s;eeks to hide it&s;elf by ca&s;ting off the <HI>Pride</HI> of <HI>Ornament,</HI> it but di&s;plays it&s;elf without a <HI>Covering:</HI> And &s;o, becoming more di&s;tingui&s;hed, by its Want of
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
<HI>Drapery,</HI> grows <HI>&s;tronger,</HI> from its <HI>purpos'd Weak|ne&s;s.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>There were formed by an anonymous Gentleman, the following Objections to &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Work.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That the Style ought to be a little rai&s;ed, at lea&s;t &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Pamela</HI> knows the Gentleman's Love is honourable, and when his Diffidence is changed to Ea&s;e: And from about the fourth Day after Marriage, it &s;hould be equal to the Rank &s;he is rais'd to, and charged to fill becomingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. That to avoid the Idea apt to be join'd with the Word '<HI>Squire,</HI> the Gentleman &s;hould be &s;tyled Sir <HI>James,</HI> or Sir <HI>John,</HI> &amp;c. and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> in a new Edition might procure for him the Title of a Baronet.</P>
<P N="3">3. That if the &s;acred Name were &s;eldomer re|peated, it would be better; for that the Wi&s;e Man's Advice is, <HI>Be not righteous over-much.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That the Penance which <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;uffers from Lady <HI>Davers</HI> might be &s;horten'd: That &s;he is too timorous after owning her Marriage to that Lady, and ought to have a little more Spirit, and get away &s;ooner out at the Window, or call her own Ser|vants to protect, and carry her to her Hu&s;band's Appointment.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Females are too apt to be &s;truck with Images of Beauty; and that the Pa&s;&s;age where the Gentleman is &s;aid to &s;pan the Wai&s;t of <HI>Pamela</HI> with his Hand, is enough to ruin a Nation of Wo|men by Tight-lacing.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Word <HI>naughty</HI> had better be changed to &s;ome other, as <HI>Bad, Faulty, Wicked, Vile, Abo|minable, Scandalous:</HI> Which in mo&s;t Places would
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
give an Empha&s;is, for which recour&s;e mu&s;t other|wi&s;e be had to the innocent Simplicity of the Wri|ter; an Idea not nece&s;&s;ary to the Moral of the Story, nor of Advantage to the Character of the Heroine.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the Words, <HI>p.</HI> 305. <HI>Fooli&s;h Thing that I am,</HI> had better be <HI>Fooli&s;h that I am.</HI> The &s;ame Gen|tleman ob&s;erves by way of <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> that Jokes are often more &s;evere, and do more Mi&s;chief, than more &s;olid Objections; and would have one or two Pa&s;&s;ages alter'd, to avoid giving Occa&s;ion for the Suppo&s;ition of a double Entendre, particularly in two Places which he mentions, <HI>viz. p.</HI> 175. <HI>and</HI> 181.</P>
<P><HI>He is plea&s;ed to take notice of &s;everal other Things of le&s;s Moment, &s;ome of which are merely typogra|phical; and very kindly expre&s;&s;es, on the Whole, a high Opinion of the Performance, and thinks it may do a great deal of Good: For all which, as well as for his Objections, the Editor gives him very &s;incere Thanks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Others are of Opinion, That the Scenes in many Places, in the Beginning e&s;pecially, are too low; and that the Pa&s;&s;ions of Lady</HI> Davers, <HI>in particular, are carried too high, and above Nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And others have intimated, That</HI> Pamela <HI>ought, for Example &s;ake, to have di&s;charg'd Mrs.</HI> Jewkes <HI>from her Service.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material Objections that have come to hand, all which are con&s;idered in the follow|ing Extracts from &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful Letters that have been written in any Language:</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Gentleman's Advice, not to alter <HI>Pamela</HI> at all, was both friendly, and &s;olidly ju&s;t. I run in, with full Sail, to his Anchorage, that the low Scenes are no more out of Nature, than the
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
high Pa&s;&s;ions of proud Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> Out of Nature, do they &s;ay? 'Tis my A&s;toni&s;hment how Men of Letters can read with &s;uch ab&s;ent Attention! They are &s;o far from <HI>Out</HI> of <HI>Na|ture,</HI> They are ab&s;olute <HI>Nature her&s;elf!</HI> or, if they mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd her <HI>Re&s;emblance</HI>; they are <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Re&s;emblance, at lea&s;t, as our <HI>true Face</HI> gives our <HI>Face</HI> in the <HI>Looking-gla&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I wonder indeed, what it is, that the Gentle|men, who talk of <HI>Low</HI> Scenes, wou'd de&s;ire &s;hould be under&s;tood by the Epithet?&mdash;Nothing, properly &s;peaking, is <HI>low,</HI> that &s;uits well with the Place it is rais'd to.&mdash;The Pa&s;&s;ions of Nature are the &s;ame, in the <HI>Lord,</HI> and his <HI>Coach-man.</HI> All, that makes them &s;eem different con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Degrees,</HI> in the <HI>Means,</HI> and the <HI>Air,</HI> where|to or wherewith they indulge 'em.

But, to imagine that Per&s;ons of Rank are above a Concern for what is thought, felt, or acted, by others, of their Species, between whom and them|&s;elves is <HI>no Difference,</HI> except &s;uch as was owing to Accident, is to reduce Human Nature to a Lowne&s;s,&mdash;<HI>too low</HI> for the <HI>Truth</HI> of her <HI>Frailty.</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And as for the oppo&s;ite Extreme they wou'd quar|rel with, the high-pa&s;&s;ion'd, and un-tam'd Lady <HI>Davers,</HI>&mdash;I cou'd direct 'em to a Dozen or two of <HI>Quality Originals,</HI> from whom (with Exception perhaps of her <HI>Wit)</HI> one wou'd &s;wear the Author had taken her Copy.&mdash;What a Sum might the&s;e Objectors en&s;ure, to be paid, by the <HI>Hu&s;bands</HI> and <HI>Sons,</HI> of &s;uch termagant, hermaphrodite Minds, upon their making due Proof, that they were no longer to be found, in the Kingdom!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I know, you are too ju&s;t to imagine me ca|pable of giving any other Opinion than my be&s;t-weigh'd and true one. But, becau&s;e it is fit you &s;hould have <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> in Support of a Judgment that can neither de&s;erve nor expect an implicit Reception, I will run over the Anonymous Let|ter I herewith return you; and note with what Lightne&s;s even Men of <HI>good-natur'd</HI> Intention fall into <HI>Mi&s;takes,</HI> by Neglect in too ha&s;ty Peru|&s;als, which their Benevolence wou'd take Plea|&s;ure in blu&s;hing at, when they di&s;cover their Weakne&s;s, in a cooler Revi&s;al.</Q></P>

as the Letters are writ to her Parents, it wou'd have look'd like forgetting, and, in &s;ome &s;ort, in&s;ulting, the Lowline&s;s of their inferior Condition, to have a&s;&s;um'd a new Air in her Language, in Place of retaining a &s;teady Humi|lity.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> PAMELA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter was indeed a great Trouble, and &s;ome Comfort to me and your poor Mother. We are troubled, to be &s;ure, for your good Lady's Death, who took &s;uch Care of you, and gave you Learn|ing, and for Three or Four Years pa&s;t has always been giving you Cloaths and Linen, and every thing that a Gentlewoman need not be a&s;ham'd to appear in. But our chief Trouble is, and indeed a very great
<PB N="5" REF="42">
one, for fear you &s;hould be brought to any thing di&s;hone&s;t or wicked, by being &s;et &s;o above your&s;elf. Every body talks how you have come on, and what a genteel Girl you are, and &s;ome &s;ay, you are very pretty; and indeed, Six Months &s;ince, when I &s;aw you la&s;t, I &s;hould have thought &s;o too, if you was not our Child. But what avails all this, if you are to be ruin'd and undone! &mdash; Indeed, my dear Child, we begin to be in great Fear for you; for what &s;ignify all the Riches in the World, with a bad Con&s;cience, and to be di&s;hone&s;t? We are, 'tis true, very poor, and find it hard enough to live; tho' once, as you know, it was better with us. But we would &s;ooner live upon the Water and Clay of the Ditches I am forced to dig, than to live better at the Price of our dear Child's Ruin.</P>
<P>I hope the good 'Squire has no De&s;ign; but when he has given you &s;o much Money, and &s;peaks &s;o kindly to you, and prai&s;es your coming on; and Oh! that fatal Word, that he would be kind to you, if you would do as <HI>you &s;hould do,</HI> almo&s;t kills us with Fears.</P>
<P>I have &s;poken to good old Widow <HI>Mumford</HI> about it, who, you know, has formerly lived in good Fa|milies, and &s;he puts us in &s;ome Comfort; for &s;he &s;ays, it is not unu&s;ual, when a Lady dies, to give what &s;he has about her Per&s;on to her Waiting-maid, and to &s;uch as &s;it up with her in her Illne&s;s. But then, why &s;hould he &s;mile &s;o kindly upon you? Why &s;hould he take &s;uch a poor Girl as you by the Hand, as your Letter &s;ays he has done twice? Why &s;hould he &s;toop to read your Letter to us; and commend your Writing and Spelling? And, why &s;hould he give you Leave to read his Mother's Books! &mdash; Indeed, indeed, my deare&s;t Child, our Hearts ake for you; and then you &s;eem &s;o full of <HI>Joy</HI> at his Goodne&s;s, &s;o <HI>taken</HI> with his kind Expre&s;&s;ions, which, truly, are
<PB N="6" REF="43">
very great Favours, if he means well, that we <HI>fear</HI> &mdash; Yes, my dear Child, we <HI>fear</HI> &mdash; you &s;hould be <HI>too</HI> grateful, &mdash; and reward him with that Jewel, your Virtue which no Riches, nor Favour, nor any thing in this Life, can make up to you.</P>
<P>I, too, have written a long Letter; but will &s;ay one Thing more; and that is, That in the Mid&s;t of our Poverty and Misfortunes, we have tru&s;ted in God's Goodne&s;s, and been hone&s;t, and doubt not to be happy hereafter, if we continue to be good, tho' our Lot is hard here; but the Lo&s;s of our dear Child's Virtue, would be a Grief that we could not bear, and would bring our grey Hairs to the Grave at once.</P>
<P>If, then, you love <HI>us,</HI> if you value <HI>God</HI>'s Ble&s;&s;ing, and <HI>your own</HI> future Happine&s;s, we both charge you to &s;tand upon your Guard; and, if you find the lea&s;t Attempt made upon your Virtue, be &s;ure you leave every thing behind you, and come away to us; for we had rather &s;ee you all cover'd with Rags, and even follow you to the Church-yard, than have it &s;aid, a Child of ours preferr'd any worldly Conveniencies to her Virtue.</P>
<P>We accept kindly of your dutiful Pre&s;ent; but 'till we are out of our Pain, cannot make u&s;e of it, for fear we &s;hould partake of the Price of our poor Daughter's Shame: So have laid it up in a Rag among the Thatch, over the Window, for a while, le&s;t we &s;hould be robb'd. With our Ble&s;&s;ings and our hearty Prayers for you, we remain,</P>

<P>I Mu&s;t needs &s;ay, your Letter has fill'd me with much Trouble. For it has made my Heart, which was overflowing with Gratitude for my Ma|&s;ter's Goodne&s;s, &s;u&s;picious and fearful; and yet, I hope I &s;hall never find him to act unworthy of his Character; for what could he get by ruining &s;uch a poor young Creature as me?

No, my dear Father and Mother, be a&s;&s;ur'd, that, by God's Grace, I never will do any thing that &s;hall bring your grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.

<P>FOR the la&s;t Letter was to my Father, in An&s;wer to his Letter; and &s;o I will now write to you; tho' I have nothing to &s;ay but what will make me look more like a vain Hu&s;&s;y, than any thing el&s;e: Yet I hope I &s;han't be &s;o proud as to forget my&s;elf. Yet there is a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure one has to hear one's &s;elf prais'd. You mu&s;t know then, that my Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> who, I need not tell you, is my Ma&s;ter's Si&s;ter, has been a Month at our Hou&s;e, and has taken great Notice of me, and given me good Advice to keep my&s;elf to my&s;elf; &s;he told me I was a very pretty Wench; and that every body gave me a very good Character, and lov'd me; and bid me take care to keep the Fellows at a Di&s;tance; and &s;aid, <HI>that</HI> I might do, and be more valu'd for it, even by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But what pleas'd me much, was what I am going to tell you; for at Table, as Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;ays, my Ma&s;ter and her Lady&s;hip talking of me, &s;he told him, &s;he thought me the prettie&s;t Wench &s;he ever &s;aw in her Life; and that I was too pretty to live in a Batchelor's Hou&s;e; &s;ince no Lady he might marry, would care to continue me with her. He &s;aid, I was va&s;tly improv'd, and had a good Share of Prudence, and Sen&s;e above my Years; and it would be Pity, that what was my Merit, &s;hould be my Misfortune.&mdash; No, &s;ays my good Lady, <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;hall come and live with me, I think. He &s;aid, Withall his Heart; he &s;hould be glad to have me &s;o well provided for. Well, &s;aid &s;he, I'll con&s;ult my Lord about it. She a&s;k'd, How old I was; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid, I was Fifteen la&s;t <HI>February.</HI> O! &s;ays &s;he, if the Wench (for &s;o &s;he calls all us Maiden Ser|vants) takes care of her&s;elf, &s;he'll improve yet more and more, as well in her Per&s;on as Mind.</P>

He &s;ays you are both &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and &s;o hone&s;t, that he always learns &s;ome|thing from you to the Purpo&s;e. It is a thou&s;and Pities, he &s;ays, that &s;uch worthy Hearts &s;hould not have better Luck in the World! and wonders, that you, my Fa|ther, who are &s;o well able to teach, and write &s;o good a Hand, &s;ucceeded no better in the School you at|tempted to &s;et up; but was forced to go to &s;uch hard Labour. But this is more Pride to me, that I am come of &s;uch hone&s;t Parents, than if I had been born a Lady.</P>
<P>I hear nothing yet of going to Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> And I am very ea&s;y at pre&s;ent here. For Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> u&s;es me as if I were her own Daughter, and is a very good Woman, and makes my Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t her own. She is always giving me good Coun&s;el, and I love her, next to you two, I think be&s;t of any body. She keeps &s;o good Rule and Order, &s;he is mightily re&s;pected by us all; and takes Delight to hear me read to her: and
<PB N="10" REF="47">
all &s;he loves to hear read, is good Books, which we read whenever we are alone; &s;o that I think I am at home with you. She heard one of our Men, <HI>Harry,</HI> who is no better than he &s;hould be, &s;peak freely to me; I think he called me his pretty <HI>Pamela,</HI> and took hold of me, as if he would have ki&s;&s;ed me; for which, you may be &s;ure, I was very angry; and &s;he took him to Ta&s;k, and was as angry at him as could be, and told me &s;he was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee my Prudence and Mode&s;ty, and that I kept all the Fellows at a Di&s;tance. And indeed I am &s;ure I am not proud, and carry it civilly to every body; but yet, methinks I cannot bear to be look'd upon by the&s;e Men-&s;ervants; for they &s;eem as if they would look one thro'; and, as I gene|really breakfa&s;t, dine, and &s;up with Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;o good &s;he is to me, I am very ea&s;y that I have &s;o little to &s;ay to them.

<P>I am going on again with a long Letter; for I love Writing, and &s;hall tire you. But when I began, I only intended to &s;ay, that I am quite fearle&s;s of any Danger now: And indeed can but wonder at my&s;elf, (tho' your Caution to me was your watchful Love) that I &s;hould be &s;o fooli&s;h as to be &s;o unea&s;y as I have been: For I am &s;ure my Ma&s;ter would not demean him&s;elf &s;o, as to think upon &s;uch a poor Girl as I, for my Harm.

<P>MY Ma&s;ter has been very kind &s;ince my la&s;t; for he has given me a Suit of my late Lady's Cloaths, and half a Dozen of her Shifts, and Six fine Handker|chiefs, and Three of her Cambrick Aprons, and Four Holland ones. The Cloaths are fine Silk, and too rich and too good for me, to be &s;ure. I wi&s;h it was no Affront to him to make Money of them, and &s;end it to you; it would do me more good.</P>
<P>You will be full of Fears, I warrant now, of &s;ome De&s;ign upon me, till I tell you, that he was with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> when he gave them me; and he gave her a Mort of good Things at the &s;ame Time, and bid her wear them in Remembrance of her good Friend, my Lady, his Mother. And when he gave me the&s;e fine Things, he &s;aid, The&s;e, <HI>Pamela,</HI> are for you; have them made fit for you, when your Mourning is laid by, and wear them for your good Mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ake.

<P>SINCE my la&s;t, my Ma&s;ter gave me more fine Things. He call'd me up to my late Lady's Clo&s;er, and pulling out her Drawers, he gave me Two Suits of fine <HI>Flanders</HI> lac'd Headcloaths, Three Pair of fine Silk Shoes, two hardly the wor&s;e, and ju&s;t fit for me, and the other with rich Silver Buckles in them (for my Lady had a very little Foot); and &s;everal Ribbands and Topknots of all Colours; Four Pair of fine white Cotton Stockens, and Three Pair of fine Silk ones; and two Pair of rich Stays. I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed, and unable to &s;peak for a while; but yet I was inwardly a&s;hamed to take the Stockens; for Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was not there: If &s;he had, it would have been nothing. I believe I receiv'd them very awkwardly; for he &s;mil'd at my Awkwardne&s;s, and &s;aid, Don't blu&s;h, <HI>Pamela:</HI> Do&s;t think I don't know pretty Maids wear Shoes and Stockens?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="50">I was &s;o confounded at the&s;e Words, you might have beat me down with a Feather. For, you mu&s;t think, there was no An&s;wer to be made to this: So, like a Fool, I was ready to cry; and went away cur|te&s;ying and blu&s;hing, I am &s;ure, up to the Ears; for, tho' there was no Harm in what he &s;aid, yet I did not know how to take it. But I went and told all to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> who &s;aid, God put it into his Heart to be good to me; and I mu&s;t double my Diligence. It looked to her, &s;he &s;aid, as if he would fit me in Dre&s;s for a Waiting-maid's Place on Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But &s;till your kind fatherly Cautions came into my Head, and made all the&s;e Gifts nothing near to me what they would have been. But yet, I hope, there is no Rea&s;on; for what Good could it do to him to harm &s;uch a &s;imple Maiden as me?

<P>O this Angel of a Ma&s;ter! this fine Gentleman! this gracious Benefactor to your poor <HI>Pamela!</HI> who was to take care of me at the Prayer of his good dying Mother; who was &s;o careful of me, le&s;t I &s;hould be drawn in by Lord <HI>Davers</HI>'s Nephew, that he would not let me go to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s: This very Gentleman (yes, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> call him Gentle|man, tho' he has fallen from the Merit of that Title) has degraded him&s;elf to offer Freedoms to his poor Servant! He has now &s;hewed him&s;elf in his true Co|lours, and to <HI>me,</HI> nothing appears &s;o black and &s;o frightful.</P>
<P>I have not been idle; but have writ from time to time, how he, by &s;ly mean Degrees, expo&s;ed his wicked Views: But &s;omebody &s;tole my Letter, and I know not what has become of it. It was a very long one. I fear that he who was mean enough to do bad things, in one re&s;pect, did not &s;tick at <HI>this</HI>; but be it as it will, all the U&s;e he can make of it will be, that he may be a&s;hamed of <HI>his</HI> Part; I not of <HI>mine.</HI> For he will &s;ee I was re&s;olved to be virtuous, and glory'd in the Hone&s;ty of my poor Parents.</P>

<P>WELL, I can't find my Letter, and &s;o I'll tell you all, as briefly as I can. All went well enough in the main for &s;ome time after my la&s;t Letter but one. At la&s;t, I &s;aw &s;ome Rea&s;on to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI>; for he would look upon me, whenever he &s;aw me, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hew'd not well; and at la&s;t he came to me, as I was in the Summer-hou&s;e in the little Garden, at work with my Needle, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was ju&s;t gone from he; and I would have gone out; but he &s;aid, No, don't go, <HI>Pamela</HI>; I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you; and you always fly me, when I come near you, as if you were afraid of me.</P>
<P>I was much out of Countenance, you may well think: but &s;aid at la&s;t, It does not become your

<P>Well, &s;ays he, my Bu&s;ine&s;s does require it &s;ome times, and I have a Mind you &s;hould &s;tay to hear what I have to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>I &s;tood all confounded, and began to tremble, and the more when he took me by the Hand; for now no Soul was near us.</P>
<P>My Si&s;ter <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;aid he (and &s;eem'd, I thought, to-be as much at a Lo&s;s for Words as I) would have had you live with <HI>her</HI>; but &s;he would not do for you what I am re&s;olved to do, if you continue faithful and obliging. What &s;ay'&s;t thou, my Girl? &s;aid he, with &s;ome Eagerne&s;s; had&s;t thou not rather &s;tay with me, than go to my Si&s;ter <HI>Davers?</HI> He look'd &s;o, as fill'd me with Affrightment; I don't know how; wildly, I thought.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, when I could &s;peak, Your Honour will for|give me; but as you have no Lady for me to wait upon, and my good Lady has been now dead this Twelvemonth, I had rather, if it would not di&s;plea&s;e you, wait upon Lady <HI>Davers, becau&s;e</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>I was proceeding, and he &s;aid a little ha&s;tily&mdash;<HI>Be|cau&s;e</HI> you are a little Fool, and know not what's good for your&s;elf. I tell you, I will make a Gentlewoman of you, if you be obliging, and don't &s;tand in your own Light, and &s;o &s;aying, he put his Arm about me, and ki&s;s'd me!</P>
<P>Now you will &s;ay, all his Wickedne&s;s appear'd plainly. I &s;truggled, and trembled, and was &s;o be|numb'd with Terror, that I &s;unk down, not in a Fit, and yet not my&s;elf; and I found my&s;elf in his Arms, quite void of Strength; and he ki&s;&s;ed me two or three times, with frightful Eagerne&s;s.&mdash;At la&s;t I bur&s;t from him, and was getting out of the Summer-hou&s;e; but he held me back, and &s;hut the Door.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="56">I would have given my Life for a Farthing. And he &s;aid, I'll do you no Harm, <HI>Pamela</HI>; don't be afraid of me, I &s;aid, I won't &s;tay.

Yet, Sir, I will be bold to &s;ay, I am hone&s;t, tho' poor: And if you was a Prince, I would not be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>He was angry, and &s;aid, Who would have you otherwi&s;e, you fooli&s;h Slut! Cea&s;e your Blubbering. I own I have demean'd my&s;elf; but it was only to try you: If you can keep this Matter &s;ecret, you'll give me the better Opinion of your Prudence; and here's &s;omething, &s;aid he, putting &s;ome Gold in my Hand, to make you Amends for the Fright I put you in. Go, take a Walk in the Garden, and don't go in till your Blubbering is over: And I charge you &s;ay nothing of what has pa&s;t, and all &s;hall be well, and I'll forgive you.</P>
<P>I won't take the Money, indeed, Sir, &s;aid I; poor as I am: I won't take it. For, to &s;ay Truth, I thought it look'd like taking Earne&s;t; and &s;o I put it upon the Bench; and as he &s;eemed vex'd and confus'd at what he had done, I took the Opportunity to open the Door, and went out of the Summer-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He called to me, and &s;aid, Be &s;ecret, I charge you, <HI>Pamela</HI>; and don't go in yet, as I told you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WELL, I will now proceed with my &s;ad Story. And &s;o, after I had dry'd my Eyes, I went in, and began to ruminate with my&s;elf what I had be&s;t to do. Sometimes I thought I would leave the Hou&s;e, and go to the next Town, and wait an Opportunity to get to you; but then I was at a Lo&s;s to re&s;olve whether to take away the Things he had given me or no, and how to take them away: Sometimes I thought to leave them behind me, and only go with the Cloaths on my Back; but then I had two Miles and a half, and a By-way to the Town; and being pretty well dre&s;s'd, I might come to &s;ome Harm, almo&s;t as bad as what I would run away from; and then may-be, thought I, it will be re|ported, I have &s;tolen &s;omething, and &s;o was forc'd to run away; and to carry a bad Name back with me to my dear Parents, would be a &s;ad thing in|deed!
<PB N="21" REF="58">
&mdash;O how I wi&s;h'd for my grey Ru&s;&s;et again, and my poor hone&s;t Dre&s;s, with which you fitted me out, (and hard enough too you had to do it!) for going to this Place, when I was not twelve Years old, in my good Lady's Days! Sometimes I thought of telling Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and taking her Advice, and only feared his Command to be &s;e|cret; for, thought I, he may be a&s;hamed of his Actions, and never attempt the like again: And as poor Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> depended upon him, thro' Misfortunes that had attended her, I thought it would be a &s;ad thing to bring his Di&s;plea&s;ure upon her for my &s;ake.</P>
<P>In this Quandary, now con&s;idering, now crying, and not knowing what to do, I pa&s;s'd the Time in my Chamber till Evening; when de&s;iring to be ex|cu&s;ed going to Supper, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> came up to me; and &s;aid, Why mu&s;t I &s;up without you, <HI>Pamela?</HI> Come, I &s;ee you are troubled at &s;omething; tell me what is the Matter.</P>
<P>I begg'd I might be permitted to lie with her on Nights; for I was afraid of Spirits, and they would not hurt &s;uch a good Per&s;on as &s;he. That was a &s;illy Excu&s;e, &s;he &s;aid; for why was you not afraid of Spirits before?&mdash;(Indeed I did not think of that). But you &s;hall be my Bed-fellow with all my Heart, added &s;he, let your Rea&s;on be what it will; only come down to Supper. I begg'd to be excus'd; for, &s;aid I, I have been crying &s;o, that it will be taken Notice of by my Fellow-&s;ervants; and I will hide nothing from you, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> when we are a-bed.</P>
<P>She was &s;o good to indulge me, and went down to Supper; but made more Ha&s;te to come up to-bed; and told the Servants, that I &s;hould lie with her, becau&s;e &s;he could not re&s;t well, and &s;he would
<PB N="22" REF="59">
get me to read her to &s;leep; for &s;he knew I lov'd reading, as &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I told her all that had pa&s;&s;ed; for I thought, though he had bid me not, yet if he &s;hould come to know I had told, it would be no wor&s;e; for to keep a Secret of &s;uch a Na|ture, would be, as I apprehended, to deprive my|&s;elf of the good Advice which I never wanted more; and might encourage him to think I did not re&s;ent it as I ought, and would keep wor&s;e Secrets, and &s;o make him do wor&s;e by me. Was I right, my dear Mother?</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> could not help mingling Tears with my Tears; for I cry'd all the Time I told her the Story, and begg'd her to advi&s;e me what to do; and I &s;hew'd her my dear Father's two Letters, and &s;he prai&s;ed the Hone&s;ty and Inditing of them, and &s;aid plea&s;ing Things to me of you both. But &s;he begg'd I would not think of leaving my Service; for, &s;ays &s;he, in all Likelihood, you behav'd &s;o virtuou&s;ly, that he will be a&s;ham'd of what he has done, and never offer the like to you again: Though, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I fear more for your Prettine&s;s than for any thing el&s;e; becau&s;e the be&s;t Man in the Land might love you; &s;o &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay. She &s;aid &s;he wi&s;h'd it was in her Power to live independent; that then &s;he would take a little private Hou&s;e, and I &s;hould live with her like her Daughter.</P>
<P>And &s;o, as you order'd me to take her Advice, I re&s;olved to tarry to &s;ee how Things went, without he was to turn me away; altho', in your fir&s;t Letter, you order'd me to come away the Moment I had any Rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive. So, dear Father and Mother, it is not Di&s;obedience, I hope, that I &s;tay; for I could not expect a Ble&s;&s;ing, or the good Fruits of your Prayers for me, if I was di&s;obedient.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="60">All the next Day I was very &s;ad, and began to write my long Letter. He &s;aw me writing, and &s;aid (as I mention'd) to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> That Girl is always &s;cribbling; methinks &s;he might find &s;ome|thing el&s;e to do; or to that purpo&s;e. And when I had fini&s;h'd my Letter, I put it under the Toilet, in my late Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-room, whither nobody comes but my&s;elf and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> be&s;ides my Ma|&s;ter; but when I came up again to &s;eal it up, to my great Concern, it was gone; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> knew nothing of it; and nobody knew of my Ma&s;ter's having been near the Place in the Time; &s;o I have been &s;adly troubled about it: But Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> as well as I, thinks he has it, &s;ome how or other; and he appears cro&s;s and angry, and &s;eems to &s;hun me, as much as he &s;aid I did him. It had better be &s;o than wor&s;e!</P>
<P>But he has order'd Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> to bid me not pa&s;s &s;o much Time in writing; which is a poor Matter for &s;uch a Gentleman as he to take Notice of, as I am not idle other-ways, if he did not re&s;ent what he thought I wrote upon. And this has no very good Look.</P>
<P>But I am a good deal ea&s;ier &s;ince I lie with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; tho' after all, the Fears I live in on one Side, and his Frowning and Di&s;plea&s;ure at what I do on the other, make me more mi&s;erable than enough.</P>
<P>O that I had never left my Rags and my Poverty, to be thus expos'd to Temptations on one hand, or Di&s;gu&s;ts on the other! How happy was I a while ago! How contrary now!&mdash;Pity and pray for</P>

She told me, &s;he was &s;urpris'd at the Que&s;tion; but &s;aid, That I was one of the mo&s;t virtuous and indu&s;trious young Creatures that ever &s;he knew. Why that Word <HI>virtuous,</HI> &s;aid he, I pray you? Was there any Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e her other|wi&s;e? Or has any body taken it into their Heads to <HI>try</HI> her? &mdash; I wonder, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, you a&s;k &s;uch a Que&s;tion!

Your Servant, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;ays he, for your good Opinion; but pray, if any body <HI>did,</HI> do you think <HI>Pamela</HI> would let <HI>you</HI> know it? Why, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, &s;he is a poor innocent young Creature, and I believe has &s;o much Confidence in me, that &s;he would take my Advice as &s;oon as &s;he would her Mother's. <HI>Innocent!</HI> again; and <HI>virtuous,</HI> I warrant!
<PB N="26" REF="63">
Well, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> you abound with your Epithets; but I take her to be an artful young Baggage; and had I a young hand&s;ome Butler or Steward, &s;he'd &s;oon make her Market of one of them, if &s;he thought it worth while to &s;nap at him for a Hu&s;band. Alack-a-day, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, 'tis early Days with <HI>Pa|mela</HI>; and &s;he does not yet think of a Hu&s;band, I dare &s;ay: And your Steward and Butler are both Men in Years, and think nothing of the Matter No, &s;aid he, if they were younger, they'd have more Wit than to think of &s;uch a Girl. I'll tell you my Mind of her, Mrs. <HI>Jervis:</HI> I don't think this &s;ame Favourite of yours &s;o very artle&s;s a Girl, as you imagine. I am not to di&s;pute with your Honour, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; but I dare &s;ay, if the Men will let her alone, &s;he'll never trouble her&s;elf about them. Why, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he, are there any Men that will <HI>not</HI> let her alone, that you know of? No, indeed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he; &s;he keeps her&s;elf &s;o much to her&s;elf, and yet behaves &s;o prudently, that they all e&s;teem her, and &s;hew her as great Re&s;pect, as if &s;he was a Gentlewoman born.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;ays he, that's her Art, that I was &s;peaking of: But let me tell you, the Girl has Vanity and Conceit, and Pride too, or I am mi&s;taken; and, per|haps, I could give you an In&s;tance of it. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you can &s;ee further than &s;uch a poor &s;illy Wo|man as I; but I never &s;aw any thing but Inno|cence in her.&mdash;And <HI>Virtue</HI> too, I'll warrant ye! &s;aid he. But &s;uppo&s;e I could give you an In&s;tance, where &s;he has talk'd a little too freely of the Kindne&s;&s;es that have been &s;hew'd her from a <HI>certain Quarter;</HI> and has had the Vanity to impute a few kind Words, utter'd in mere Compa&s;&s;ion to her Youth and Cir|cum&s;tances, into a De&s;ign upon her, and even dar'd to make free with Names that &s;he ought never to mention but with Reverence and Gratitude; what

would you &s;ay to that?&mdash;Say, Sir! &s;aid &s;he, I cannot tell what to &s;ay. But I hope <HI>Pamela</HI> incapable of &s;uch Ingratitude.</P>
<P>Well, no more of this &s;illy Girl, &s;ays he; you may only advi&s;e her, as you are her Friend, not to give her&s;elf too much Licence upon the Favours &s;he meets with; and if &s;he &s;tays here, that &s;he will not write the Affairs of my Family purely for an Exerci&s;e to her Pen and her Invention. I tell you, &s;he is a &s;ubtle artful Gyp&s;ey, and Time will &s;hew it you.</P>
<P>Was ever the like heard, my dear Father and Mo|ther?

<P>He interrupted me, and &s;aid. <HI>Hardly!</HI> you little Equivocator! what do you mean by <HI>hardly?</HI> Let me ask you, Have you not told Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> for one? Pray your Honour, &s;aid I, all in Agitation, let me go down; for 'tis not for <HI>me</HI> to hold an Argument with your Honour. Equivocator, again! &s;aid he, and took my Hand, what do you talk of an <HI>Argu|ment?</HI> Is it holding an Argument with me, to an&s;wer a plain Que&s;tion? An&s;wer me what I ask'd. O good Sir, &s;aid I, let me beg you will not urge me further, for fear I forget my&s;elf again, and be &s;aucy.</P>
<P>An&s;wer me then, I bid you, &s;ays he, Have you not told Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> It will be &s;aucy in you, if you don't an&s;wer me directly to what I ask. Sir, &s;aid I, and fain would have pulled my Hand away, perhaps I &s;hould be for an&s;wering you by another Que&s;tion, and that would not become me. What is it you would &s;ay? replies be, &s;peak out.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="66">Then, Sir, &s;aid I, why &s;hould your Honour be &s;o angry I &s;hould tell Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> or any body el&s;e, what pa&s;&s;ed, if you intended no Harm?</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, pretty <HI>Innocent</HI> and <HI>Artle&s;s!</HI> as Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> calls you, &s;aid he; and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me, in&s;olent as you are! But &s;till I will be an&s;wered directly to my Que&s;tion? Why then, Sir, &s;aid I, I will not tell a Lie for the World: I <HI>did</HI> tell Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; for my Heart was almo&s;t broken; but I open'd not my Mouth to any other. Very well, Bold-face, &s;aid he, and Equivocator again! You did not open your <HI>Mouth</HI> to any other; but did you not <HI>write</HI> to &s;ome other? Why now, and plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid I, (for I was quite courageous ju&s;t then) you could not have a&s;ked me this Que&s;tion if you had not taken from me my Letter to my Father and Mother, in which I own I had broken my Mind freely to them, and a&s;ked their Advice, and poured forth my Griefs!</P>
<P>And &s;o I am to be expo&s;ed, am I, &s;aid he, <HI>in</HI> my Hou&s;e, and <HI>out</HI> of my Hou&s;e, to the whole World, by &s;uch a Saucebox as you? No, good, Sir, &s;aid I, and I hope your Honour won't be angry with me; it is not <HI>I</HI> that expo&s;e you, if I &s;ay nothing but the Truth. So, taunting again! A&s;&s;urance as you are! &s;aid he: I will not be thus talk'd to!</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, whom can a poor Girl take Ad|vice of, if it mu&s;t not be of her Father and Mo|ther, and &s;uch a good Woman as Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> who, for her Sex-&s;ake, &s;hould give it me when a&s;ked! In&s;olence! &s;aid he, and &s;tamp'd with his Foot, Am I to be que&s;tion'd thus by &s;uch an one as you? I fell down on my Knees, and &s;aid, For Heaven's &s;ake, your Honour, pity a poor Creature, that knows nothing of her Duty, but how to cheri&s;h her Vir|tue and good Name: I have nothing el&s;e to tru&s;t to: and tho' poor and friendle&s;s here, yet I have al|ways
<PB N="30" REF="67">
been taught to value Hone&s;ty above my Life. Here's ado with your Hone&s;ty, &s;aid he, fooli&s;h Girl! Is it not one Part of Hone&s;ty, to be dutiful and grate|ful to your Ma&s;ter, do you think? Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be ingrateful to your Honour, or di&s;obedient, or de&s;erve the Names of Bold-face and In&s;olent, which you call me, but when your Com|mands are contrary to that fir&s;t Duty, which &s;hall ever be the Principle of my Life!</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to be moved, and ro&s;e up, and walk'd into the great Chamber two or three Turns, leaving me on my Knees; and I threw my Apron over my Face, and laid my Head on a Chair, and cry'd as if my Heart would break, having no Power to &s;tir.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he came in again, but, alas! with Mi&s;|chief in his Heart! and rai&s;ing me up, he &s;aid, Ri&s;e, <HI>Pamela,</HI> ri&s;e; you are your own Enemy. Your perver&s;e Folly will be your Ruin: I tell you this, that I am very much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Freedoms you have taken with my Name to my Hou&s;e-keeper, as al&s;o to your Father and Mother; and you may as well have <HI>real</HI> Cau&s;e to take the&s;e Freedoms with me, as to make my Name &s;uffer for <HI>imaginary</HI> ones. And &s;aying &s;o, he offer'd to take me on his Knee, with &s;ome Force. O how I was terrify'd! I &s;aid, like as I had read in a Book a Night or two before, Angels, and Saints, and all the Ho&s;t of Heaven, de|fend me! And may I never &s;urvive one Moment, that fatal one in which I &s;hall forfeit my Innocence. Pretty Fool! &s;aid he, how will you forfeit your In|nocence, if you are oblig'd to yield to a Force you cannot with&s;tand? Be ea&s;y, &s;aid he; for let the wor&s;t happen that can, <HI>you'll</HI> have the Merit, and <HI>I</HI> the Blame; and it will be a good Subject for Letters to your Father and Mother, and a Tale into the Bargain for Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="68">He by Force ki&s;&s;ed my Neck and Lips; and &s;aid, Who ever blamed <HI>Lucretia,</HI> but the <HI>Ravi&s;her</HI> only?

May I, &s;aid I, <HI>Lucretia</HI> like, ju&s;tify my&s;elf with my Death, if I am u&s;ed barbarou&s;ly? O my good Girl! &s;aid he, tauntingly, you are well read, I &s;ee; and we &s;hall make out between us, be|fore we have done, a pretty Story in Romance, I warrant ye.</P>
<P>He then put his Hand in my Bo&s;om, and the In|dignation gave me double Strength, and I got loo&s;e from him by a &s;udden Spring, and ran out of the Room; and the next Chamber being open, I made &s;hift to get into it, and threw-to the Door, and the Key being on the In&s;ide, it locked; but he follow'd me &s;o clo&s;e, he got hold of my Gown, and tore a Piece off, which hung without the Door.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t remember I got into the Room; for I knew nothing further of the Matter till afterwards; for I fell into a Fit with my Fright and Terror, and there I lay, till he, as I &s;uppo&s;e, looking through the Key-hole, &s;py'd me lying all along upon the Floor, &s;tretch'd out at my Length; and then he call'd Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> to me, who, by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, bur&s;ting open the Door, he went away, &s;eeing me coming to my&s;elf; and bid her &s;ay nothing of the Matter, if &s;he was wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> thought it was wor&s;e, and cry'd over me like as if &s;he was my Mother; and I was two Hours before I came to my&s;elf; and ju&s;t as I got a little up on my Feet, he coming in, I went away again with the Terror; and &s;o he withdrew: But he &s;taid in the next Room to let nobody come near us, that his foul Proceedings might not be known.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="69">Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> gave me her Smelling-bottle, and had cut my Laces, and far me in a great Chair, and he call'd her to him: How is the Girl? &s;aid he: I ne|ver &s;aw &s;uch a Fool in my Life. I did nothing at all to her. Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> could not &s;peak for crying. So he &s;aid, She has told you, it &s;eems, that I was kind to her in the Summer-hou&s;e, tho' I'll a&s;&s;ure you, I was quite innocent then as well as now, and I de|&s;ire you to keep this Matter to your&s;elf, and let <HI>me</HI> not be nam'd in it.</P>
<P>O, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, for your Honour's &s;ake, and for Chri&s;t's &s;ake&mdash; But he would not hear her, and &s;aid &mdash; For <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, I tell you, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;ay not a Word more. I have done her no Harm. And I won't have her &s;tay in my Hou&s;e; prating, perver&s;e Fool, as &s;he is!

<P>And &s;o he went out in a Pet, and order'd his Cha|riot and Four to be got ready, and went a Vi&s;iting &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> then came to me, and I told her all that had happen'd, and &s;aid I was re&s;olv'd not to &s;tay in the Hou&s;e: And &s;he &s;aying, He &s;eem'd to threaten as much; I &s;aid, I am glad of that; then I &s;hall be ea&s;y.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> is very loth I &s;hould go; and yet, poor Woman! &s;he begins to be afraid for her&s;elf; but would not have me ruin'd for the World.

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Parents,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Know you longed to hear from me &s;oon. I &s;end as &s;oon as I could.</P>
<P>Well, you may believe how unea&s;ily I pa&s;&s;ed the Time, till his appointed Hour came. Every Minute, as it grew nearer, my Terrors increa&s;ed; and &s;ome|times I had great Courage, and &s;ometimes none at all; and I thought I &s;hould faint when it came to the Time my Ma&s;ter had dined. I could neither eat nor drink for my part; and do what I could, my Eyes were &s;well'd with crying.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he went up to the Clo&s;et, which was my good Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-room; a Room I once lov'd, but then as much hated.</P>
<P>Don't your Heart ake for me? &mdash; I am &s;ure mine flutter'd about like a new-caught Bird in a Cage. O <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid I to my&s;elf, why art thou &s;o fooli&s;h and fearful! Thou ha&s;t done no Harm! What, if thou feare&s;t an unju&s;t Judge, when thou art innocent, would&s;t thou do before a ju&s;t one, if thou wert guilty? Have Courage, <HI>Pamela,</HI> thou knowe&s;t the wor&s;t! And how ea&s;y a Choice Poverty and Hone&s;ty is, rather than Plenty and Wickedne&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="71">So I chear'd my&s;elf; but yet my poor Heart &s;unk, and my Spirits were quite broken. Every thing that &s;tirred, I thought was to call me to my Account. I dreaded it, and yet I wi&s;hed it to come.</P>
<P>Well, at la&s;t he rung the Bell; O, thought I, that it was my Pa&s;&s;ing-bell! Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> went up, with a full Heart enough, poor good Woman! He &s;aid, Where's <HI>Pamela?</HI> Let her come up, and do you come with her. She came to me: I was ready to come with my Feet, but my Heart was with my dear Father and Mother, wi&s;hing to &s;hare your Poverty and Happine&s;s. But I went.</P>
<P>O how can wicked Men &s;eem &s;o &s;teady and un|touch'd, with &s;uch black Hearts, while poor Inno|cents look like Malefactors before them!</P>
<P>He look'd &s;o &s;tern, that my Heart failed me, and I wi&s;h'd my&s;elf any-where but there, tho' I had be|fore been &s;ummoning up all my Courage. Good Heaven, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, give me Courage to &s;tand before this naughty Ma&s;ter! O &s;often him, or har|den me!</P>
<P>Come in, Fool, &s;aid he, angrily, as &s;oon as he &s;aw me (and &s;natch'd my Hand with a Pull); you may well be a&s;hamed to &s;ee me, after your Noi&s;e and Non&s;en&s;e, and expo&s;ing me as you have done. I a&s;ham'd to &s;ee <HI>you!</HI> thought I: Very pretty in|deed! &mdash; But I &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he, here you are both together, Do you &s;it down; but let her &s;tand if &s;he will: Ay thought I, if I <HI>can</HI>; for my Knees beat one again&s;t another. Did you not think, when you &s;aw the Girl in the Way you found her in, that I had given her the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion that could po&s;&s;ibly be given any Woman? And that I had actually ruined her, as &s;he calls it? Tell me, <HI>could</HI> you think any thing le&s;s? Indeed, &s;ay'd &s;he, I fear'd &s;o at fir&s;t. Has &s;he told you what I did to her, and <HI>all</HI> I did to her, to
<PB N="35" REF="72">
occa&s;ion all this Folly, by which my Reputation might have &s;uffer'd in your Opinion, and in that of all the Family?&mdash;Inform me, what has &s;he told you?</P>
<P>She was a little too much frighted, as &s;he owned afterwards, at his Sternne&s;s, and &s;aid. Indeed &s;he told me you only pulled her on your Knee, and ki&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Then I plucked up my Spirit a little. <HI>Only</HI>! Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I; and was not that enough to &s;hew me what I had to fear? When a Ma&s;ter of his Honour's Degree demeans him&s;elf to be &s;o free as <HI>that</HI> to &s;uch a poor Servant as me, what is the next to be expected?&mdash; But your Honour went fur|ther, &s;o you did; and threaten'd me what you would do, and talk'd of <HI>Lucretia,</HI> and her hard Fate.&mdash;Your Honour knows you went too far for a Ma&s;ter to a Servant, or even to his Equal; and I cannot bear it. So I fell a crying mo&s;t &s;adly.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> began to excu&s;e me, and to beg he would pity a poor Maiden, that had &s;uch a Value for her Reputation. He &s;aid, I &s;peak it to her Face, I think her very pretty, and I thought her humble, and one that would not grow upon my Favours, or the Notice I took of her, but I abhor the Thought of forcing her to any thing. I know my&s;elf better, &s;aid he, and what, belongs to me: And to be &s;ure I have enough demean'd my&s;elf to take Notice of &s;uch a one as &s;he; but I was bewitch'd by her, I think, to be freer than became me; tho' I had no Intention to carry the Je&s;t farther.</P>
<P>What poor Stuff was all this, my dear Mother, from a Man of his Sen&s;e! But &s;ee how a bad Cau&s;e and bad Actions confound the greate&s;t Wits! &mdash; It gave me a little more Courage then; for Innocence, I find, in a weak mind, has many Advantages over Guilt, with all its Riches and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="73">So I &s;aid, Your Honour may call this Je&s;t or Sport, or what you plea&s;e; but indeed, Sir, it is not a Je&s;t that becomes the Di&s;tance between a Ma&s;ter and a Servant. Do you hear, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> &s;aid he: Do you hear the Pertne&s;s of the Creature? I had a good deal of this Sort before in the Summer-hou&s;e, and Ye&s;terday too, which made me rougher with her than perhaps I had otherwi&s;e been.</P>
<P>Says Mrs. <HI>Jervis, Pamela,</HI> don't be pert to his Honour? You &s;hould know your Di&s;tance; you &s;ee his Honour was only in Je&s;t. &mdash; O dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, don't <HI>you</HI> blame me too. It is very difficult to keep one's Di&s;tance to the greate&s;t of Men, when they won't keep it them&s;elves to their meane&s;t Ser|vants.</P>
<P>See again, &s;aid he; could you believe this of the young Baggage, if you had not heard it? Good your Honour, &s;aid the well-meaning Gentlewoman, pity and forgive the poor Girl; &s;he is but a Girl, and her Virtue is very dear to her; and I will pawn my Life for her, &s;he will never be pert to your Honour, if you'll be &s;o good as to mole&s;t her no more, nor frighten her again. Said &s;he, You &s;ee how, by her Fit, &s;he was in Terror; &s;he could not help it; and tho' your Honour intended her no Harm, yet the Apprehen&s;ion was almo&s;t Death to her: And I had much ado to bring her to her&s;elf again. O the little Hypocrite! &s;aid he; &s;he has all the Arts of her Sex; they are <HI>born</HI> with her; and I told you a-while ago, you did not know her. But, &s;aid he, this was not the Rea&s;on principally of my calling you before me both together: I find I am likely to &s;uffer in my Reputation by the Perver&s;ene&s;s and Folly of this Girl. She has told you all, and perhaps more than all; nay, I make no Doubt of it; and &s;he has writ|ten Letters (for I find &s;he is a mighty Letter-writer!) to her Father and Mother, and others, as far as I
<PB N="37" REF="74">
know; in which &s;he makes her&s;elf an Angel of Light, and me, her kind Ma&s;ter and Benefactor, a Devil incarnate.&mdash;(O how People will &s;ometimes, thought I, call them&s;elves by their right Names!&mdash;) And all this I won't bear; and &s;o I am re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hall re|turn to the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Poverty &s;he was taken from; and let her take care how &s;he u&s;es my Name with Freedom, when &s;he is gone from me.</P>
<P>I was brighten'd up at once with the&s;e welcome Words: And I threw my&s;elf upon my Knees at his Feet, with a mo&s;t &s;incere, glad Heart, and I &s;aid, May your Honour be for ever ble&s;&s;ed for your Re&s;o|lution! Now I &s;hall be happy. And permit me, on my bended Knees, to thank you for all the Bene|fits and Favours you have heap'd upon me; for the Opportunities I have had of Improvement and Learn|ing, thro' my good Lady's Means, and yours. I will now forget all your Honour has offer'd to me: And I promi&s;e you, that I will never take your Name in my Lips, but with Reverence and Grati|tude: And &s;o God Almighty ble&s;s your Honour, for ever and ever, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing from my Knees, I went away with another-gui&s;e &s;ort of Heart than I came into his Pre|&s;ence with: And &s;o I fell to writing this Letter. And thus all is happily over.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Father and Mother, expect to &s;ee &s;oon your poor Daughter, with an humble and dutiful Mind return'd to you: And don't fear but I know how to be happy with you as ever: For I will lie in the Loft, as I u&s;ed to do; and pray let the little Bed be got ready; and I have a little Money, which will buy me a Suit of Cloaths, fitter for my Condition than what I have; and I will get Mrs. <HI>Mumford</HI> to help me to &s;ome Needle-work; and fear not that I &s;hall be a Burden to you, if my Health continues; and I know I &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed,

if not for my own &s;ake, for both your &s;akes, who have, in all your Trials and Misfortunes, pre&s;erved &s;o much Integrity, as makes every body &s;peak well of you both. But I hope he will let good Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis</HI> give me a Character, for fear it &s;hould be thought I was turn'd away for Di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear Parents, may you be ble&s;t for me, and I for you! And I will always pray for my Ma&s;ter and Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> So good Night; for it is late, and I &s;hall be &s;oon called to-bed.</P>
<P>I hope Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> is not angry with me, becau&s;e &s;he has not called me to Supper with her; tho' I could eat nothing if &s;he had. But I make no Doubt I &s;hall &s;leep purely To-night, and dream that I am with you, in my dear, dear, happy Loft once more.</P>

At la&s;t &s;he came up, but &s;eem'd &s;hy and re&s;erv'd; and I &s;aid, O my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I am glad to &s;ee you: You are not angry with me, I hope. She &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry Things had gone &s;o far; and that &s;he had a great deal of Talk with my Ma&s;ter after I was gone; that he &s;eem'd mov'd at what I &s;aid, and at my falling on my Knees to him, and my Prayer for him, at my going away. He &s;aid, I was a &s;trange Girl; he knew not what to make of me: And is &s;he gone? &s;aid he: I intended to &s;ay &s;omething el&s;e to her, but &s;he behav'd &s;o oddly, that I had not Power to &s;top her. She a&s;k'd, If &s;he &s;hould call me again? He &s;aid, Yes; and then, No, let her go; it is be&s;t for her and me too, that &s;he &s;hall go now I have given her Warn|ing. But where &s;he had it, I can't tell; but I never met with the Fellow of her in my Life, at any Age. She &s;aid, he had order'd her not to tell me all: But &s;he believ'd he never would offer any thing to me

again, and I might &s;tay, &s;he fan&s;y'd, if I would beg it as a Favour; tho' &s;he was not <HI>&s;ure</HI> neither.</P>
<P>I &s;tay! dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I; why 'tis the be&s;t News that could have come to me, that he will let me go. I do nothing but long to go back again to my <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> as he &s;aid I &s;hould; for, tho' I am &s;ure of the Poverty, I &s;hall not have half the Di&s;tre&s;s I have had for &s;ome Months pa&s;t, I'll a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> dear good Soul! wept over me, and &s;aid, Well, well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I did not think I had &s;hew'd &s;o little Love to you, as that you &s;hould ex|pre&s;s &s;o much Joy to leave me. I am &s;ure I never had a Child half &s;o dear to me as you.</P>
<P>I wept to hear her &s;o good to me, as indeed &s;he has always been; and &s;aid, What would you have me <HI>to do,</HI> dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> I love you next to my own Father and Mother, and to leave you is the chief Con|cern I have at quitting this Place; but I am &s;ure it is certain Ruin if I &s;tay. After &s;uch Offers, and &s;uch Threatenings, and his comparing him&s;elf to a wicked Ravi&s;her, in the very Time of his la&s;t Offer; and making a Je&s;t of me, that we &s;hould make a pretty Story in Romance; can I &s;tay, and be &s;afe? Has he not demean'd him&s;elf twice? And it behoves me to beware of the third time, for fear he &s;hould lay his Snares &s;urer; for may-hap he did not expect a poor Servant would re&s;i&s;t her Ma&s;ter &s;o much. And mu&s;t it not be look'd upon as a &s;ort of Warrant for &s;uch Actions, if I &s;tay after this? For I think, when one of our Sex finds &s;he is attempted, it is an Encouragement to a Per&s;on to proceed, if one puts one's &s;elf in the Way of it, when one can help it; and it &s;hews one can forgive what in &s;hort, ought <HI>not</HI> to be forgiven: Which is no &s;mall Countenance to foul Actions, I'll a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="79">She hugg'd me to her, and &s;aid, <HI>I'll a&s;&s;ure you!</HI> Pretty-face, where gotte&s;t thou all thy Knowledge, and thy good Notions, at the&s;e Years? Thou art a Miracle for thy Age, and I &s;hall always love thee.&mdash; But, do you <HI>re&s;olve</HI> to leave us, <HI>Pamela?</HI></P>
<P>Yes, my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I; for, as Matters &s;tand, how can I do otherwi&s;e?&mdash;But I'll do all the Duties of my Place fir&s;t, if I may. And hope you'll give me a Character as to my Hone&s;ty, that it may not be thought I was turn'd away for any Harm. Ay, that I will, &s;aid &s;he; I will give thee &s;uch a Character as ne|ver Girl at thy Years de&s;erv'd. And, I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, I will always love and honour you, as my third be&s;t Friend, where-ever I go, or whatever becomes of me.</P>
<P>And &s;o we went to Bed, and I never wak'd 'till 'twas Time to ri&s;e; which I did, as blythe as a Bird, and went about my Bu&s;ine&s;s with great Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But I believe my Ma&s;ter is fearfully angry with me; for he pa&s;s'd by me two or three times, and would not &s;peak to me; and towards Evening he met me in the Pa&s;&s;age, going into the Garden, and &s;aid &s;uch a Word to me as I never heard in my Life from him, to Man, Woman or Child; for he fir&s;t &s;aid, This Crea|ture's always in my way, I think.

<P>I profe&s;s, I trembled to hear him &s;ay &s;o; but I <HI>&s;aw</HI> he was vex'd; and as I am going away, I minded it the le&s;s. But I &s;ee, my dear Parents, that when a Per&s;on will do wicked Things, it is no Wonder he will &s;peak wicked Words. And &s;o I re&s;t</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR <HI>John</HI> having no Opportunity to go your Way, I write again, and &s;end both Letters at once. I can't &s;ay, yet, when I &s;hall get away, nor how I &s;hall come; becau&s;e Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;hew'd my Ma&s;ter the Wai&s;tcoat I am flowering for him, and he &s;aid. It looks well enough: I think the Creature had be&s;t &s;tay till &s;he has fini&s;h'd it.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome private Talk carry'd on betwixt him and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that &s;he don't tell me of; but yet &s;he is very kind to me, and I don't mi&s;tru&s;t her at all. I &s;hould be very ba&s;e if I did. But, to be &s;ure, &s;he mu&s;t oblige him, and keep all his lawful Commands; and other, I dare &s;ay, &s;he won't keep: She is too good, and loves me too well; but <HI>&s;he</HI> mu&s;t &s;tay when I am gone, and &s;o mu&s;t get no Ill-will.</P>
<P>She has been at me again to ask to &s;tay, and humble my&s;elf, as &s;he calls it. But what have I done, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> &s;aid I: If I have been a Sauce-box, and a Bold-face, and Pert, and a Creature, as he calls me, have I not had Rea&s;on? Do you think I &s;hould ever have forgot <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if he had not forgot to act as my <HI>Ma&s;ter?</HI> Tell me, from your own Heart, dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, if you think I could &s;tay and be &s;afe: What would <HI>you</HI> think, or how would <HI>you</HI> act, in <HI>my</HI> Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and ki&s;s'd me, I don't know how I &s;hould act, or what I &s;hould think. I hope I &s;hould act as <HI>you</HI> do. But I know nobody el&s;e that would. My Ma&s;ter is a fine Gentleman; he has a great deal of Wit and Sen&s;e, and is admir'd, as I know, by half a dozen Ladies, who would think
<PB N="44" REF="81">
them&s;elvs happy in his Addre&s;&s;es. He has a noble E&s;tate; and yet I believe he loves my good Maiden, tho' his Servant, better than all the Ladies in the Land; and he has try'd to overcome it, becau&s;e he knows you are &s;o much his Inferior; and 'tis my Opi|nion he finds he can't; and that vexes his proud Heart, and makes him re&s;olve you &s;han't &s;tay; and &s;o he &s;peaks &s;o to cro&s;s you, when he &s;ees you by Accident.</P>
<P>Well, but, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, let me ask you, if he can &s;toop to like &s;uch a poor Girl as I, as perhaps he may (for I have read of Things almo&s;t as &s;trange, from great Men to poor Dam&s;els) What can it be <HI>for?</HI>&mdash;He may conde&s;cend, may-hap, to think I may be good enough for his Harlot; and tho&s;e Things don't di&s;grace Men, that ruin poor Women, as the World goes. And &s;o, if I was wicked enough, he would keep me till I was undone, and 'till his Mind changed; for even wicked Men, I have read, &s;oon grow weary of Wickedne&s;s of <HI>one</HI> Sort, and love <HI>Variety.</HI> Well then, poor <HI>Pamela</HI> mu&s;t be turn'd off, and look'd upon as a vile abandon'd Creature, and every body would de&s;pi&s;e her; ay, and <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> too, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; for &s;he that can't keep her Virtue, ought to live in Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>But, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> continued I, let me tell you, that I hope, if I was &s;ure he would always be kind to me, and never turn me off at all, that I &s;hall have &s;o much Grace, as to hate and with&s;tand his Temptations, were he not only my Ma&s;ter, but my King; and that for the <HI>Sin</HI>'s &s;ake. This my poor dear Parents have always taught me; and I &s;hould be a &s;ad wicked Creature indeed, if, for the &s;ake of Riches or Favour, I &s;hould forfeit my good Name: yea, and wor&s;e than any other young body of my Sex; becau&s;e I can &s;o contentedly return to my Poverty again, and think it le&s;s Di&s;grace to be oblig'd to wear Rags, and
<PB N="45" REF="82">
live upon Rye-bread and Water, as I u&s;ed to do, than to be a Harlot to the greate&s;t Man in the World.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> lifted up her Hands, and had her Eyes full of Tears. God ble&s;s you, my dear Love! &s;aid &s;he; you are my Admiration and Delight.&mdash;How &s;hall I do to part with you!</P>
<P>Well, good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, let me ask you now: &mdash;You and he have had &s;ome Talk, and you <HI>mayn't</HI> be &s;uffer'd to tell me all. But, do you think, if I was to ask to &s;tay, that he is &s;orry for what he has done? ay, and <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> of it too? for I am &s;ure he ought, con&s;idering his high Degree, and my low Degree, and how I have nothing in the World to tru&s;t to but my Hone&s;ty: Do you think in <HI>your own</HI> Con&s;cience now (pray an&s;wer me truly) that he would never offer any thing to me again, and that I could be &s;afe?</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Child, &s;aid &s;he, don't put thy home Que&s;tions to me, with that pretty becoming Earne&s;t|ne&s;s in thy Look. I know this, that he is vex'd at what he has done; he was vex'd the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time, more vex'd the <HI>&s;econd</HI> time.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid I, and &s;o he will be vex'd, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>third,</HI> and the <HI>fourth</HI> time too, 'till he has quite ruin'd your poor Maiden; and who will have Cau&s;e to be vex'd then?</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, don't imagine that I would be acce&s;&s;ary to your Ruin for the World. I only can &s;ay, that he has, yet, done you no Hurt; and 'tis no Wonder he &s;hould love you, you are &s;o pretty; tho' &s;o much beneath him: But I dare &s;wear for him, he never will offer you any Force.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, &s;aid I, that he was &s;orry for his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Offer in the Summer-hou&s;e; well, and how long did his Sorrow la&s;t?&mdash;Only 'till he found me by my&s;elf; and then he was wor&s;e than before: and &s;o became
<PB N="46" REF="83">
&s;orry <HI>again.</HI> And if he has deign'd to love me, and you &s;ay can't <HI>help</HI> it, why he can't <HI>help</HI> it neither, if he &s;hould have an Opportunity, a <HI>third</HI> time to di&s;tre&s;se me. And I have read, that many a Man has been a&s;ham'd of his Wickedne&s;s at a Repul&s;e, that never would, had he &s;ucceeded. Be&s;ides, Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis,</HI> if he really intends to offer no <HI>Force,</HI> What does <HI>that</HI> mean?&mdash;While you &s;ay he can't <HI>help</HI> liking me, for <HI>Love</HI> it cannot be&mdash;Does it not imply, that he hopes to ruin me by my own <HI>Con&s;ent?</HI> I <HI>think,</HI> &s;aid I, (and I hope I &s;hould have Grace to <HI>do</HI> &s;o) that I &s;hould not give way to his Temptations on <HI>any</HI> Ac|count; but it would be very pre&s;umptuous in me to rely upon my own Strength, again&s;t a Gentleman of his Qualifications and E&s;tate, and who is my <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>; and thinks him&s;elf intitled to call me Bold-face, and what not? only for &s;tanding on my nece&s;&s;ary Defence: And that where the Good of my Soul and Body, and my Duty to God, and my Parents, are all concern'd. How then, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, can I <HI>ask</HI> or <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to &s;tay?</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;ays &s;he, as he &s;eems very de&s;irous you &s;hould <HI>not</HI> &s;tay, I hope it is from a good Motive; for fear he &s;hould be tempted to di&s;grace him&s;elf as well as you. No, no, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I; I have thought of that too; for I would be glad to think of him with that Duty that becomes me: But then he would have let me gone to Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and not have hinder'd my Preferment. And he would not have &s;aid, I &s;hould return to my <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> when, by his Mother's Goodne&s;s, I had been lifted out of it; but that he intended to fright me, and <HI>puni&s;h</HI> me, as he thought, for not complying with his Wickedne&s;s: and this &s;hews me enough what I have to expect from his future Goodne&s;s, except I will de&s;erve it at his own dear, dear Price.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="84">She was &s;ilent, and I &s;aid, Well, there's no more to be &s;aid; I mu&s;t go, that's certain: All my Concern will be how to part with <HI>you:</HI> And indeed, next to you, with <HI>every body</HI>; for all my Fellow-&s;ervants have loved me, and you and they will co&s;t me a Sigh, and a Tear, too, now-and-then, I am &s;ure. And &s;o I fell a-crying: I could not help it. For it is a plea&s;ant Thing to one to be in a Hou&s;e among a great many Fellow-&s;ervants, and be belov'd by them all.</P>
<P>Nay, I &s;hould have told you before now, how kind and civil Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> our Steward is; va&s;tly cour|teous, indeed, on all Occa&s;ions! And he &s;aid once to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> he wi&s;h'd he was a young Man for my &s;ake; I &s;hould be his Wife, and he would &s;ettle all he had upon me on Marriage; and, you mu&s;t know, he is reckon'd worth a Power of Money.</P>
<P>I take no Pride in this; but ble&s;s God, and your good Example, my dear Parents, that I have been en|abled &s;o to carry my&s;elf, as to have every body's good Word. Not but that our Cook one Day, who is a little &s;nappi&s;h and cro&s;s &s;ometimes, &s;aid once to me, Why this <HI>Pamela</HI> of <HI>ours</HI> goes as fine as a Lady. See what it is to have a fine Face! &mdash; I wonder what the Girl will come to at la&s;t!</P>
<P>She was hot with her Work; and I &s;neak'd away; for I &s;eldom go down into the Kitchen; and I heard the Butler &s;ay, Why, <HI>Jane,</HI> nobody has your good Word: What has Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI> done to you? I am &s;ure <HI>&s;he</HI> offends nobody. And what, &s;aid the peevi&s;h Wench, have I &s;aid to her, <HI>Foolatum;</HI> but that &s;he was pretty?

<P>I Did not &s;end my la&s;t Letters &s;o &s;oon as I hop'd, becau&s;e <HI>John</HI> (whether my Ma&s;ter mi&s;tru&s;ts or no, I can't &s;ay) had been &s;ent to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s, in|&s;tead of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who u&s;ed to go; and I could not be &s;o free with, nor &s;o well tru&s;t <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> tho' he is very civil to me too.

So
<PB N="49" REF="86">
I will begin where I left off about the Talk between Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and me, for me to ask to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Unknown to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I put a Project, as I may call it, in Practice. I thought with my&s;elf &s;ome Days ago, Here I &s;hall go home to my poor Father and Mother, and have nothing on my Back, that will be fit for my Condition; for how &s;hould your poor Daughter look with a Silk Night-gown, Silken Petticoats, Cambrick Head-cloaths, fine Hol|land Linen, lac'd Shoes, that were my Lady's, and fine Stockens! And how in a little while mu&s;t they have look'd, like old Ca&s;t-offs indeed, and I look'd &s;o for wearing them! And People would have &s;aid, (for poor Folks are envious, as well as rich) See there Goody <HI>Andrews</HI>'s Daughter, turn'd home from her fine Place! What a tawdry Figure &s;he makes! And how well that Garb becomes her poor Parents Cir|cum&s;tances! &mdash;And how would they look upon me, thought I to my&s;elf, when they come to be thread-bare and worn out? And how &s;hould I look, even if I could get home&s;pun Cloaths, to dwindle into them one by one, as I could get them?&mdash;May-be, an old Silk Gown, and a Lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey Petticoat, and the like. So, thought I, I had better get my&s;elf at once 'quipt in the Dre&s;s that will become my Condition; and tho' it may look but poor to what I have been us'd to wear of late Days, yet it will &s;erve me, when I am with you, for a good Holiday and <HI>Sunday</HI> Suit, and what, by a Ble&s;&s;ing on my Indu&s;try, I may, per|haps, make &s;hift to keep up to.</P>
<P>So, as I was &s;aying, unknown to any body, I bought of Farmer <HI>Nichols</HI>'s Wife and Daughters, a good &s;ad-colour'd Stuff, of their own Spinning, enough to make me a Gown and two Petticoats; and I made Robings and Facings of a pretty Bit of printed Calico, I had by me.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="87">I had a pretty good Camblet quilted Coat, that I thought might do tolerably well; and I bought two Flanel Under-coats; not &s;o good as my Swan-skin and fine Linen ones, but what will keep me warm, if any Neighbour &s;hould get me to go out to help 'em to milk, now-and-then, as &s;ometimes I us'd to do formerly; for I am re&s;olv'd to do all your good Neighbours what Kindne&s;s I can; and hope to make my&s;elf as much belov'd about you, as I am here.</P>
<P>I got &s;ome pretty good <HI>Scots</HI> Cloth, and made me, at Mornings and Nights, when nobody &s;aw me, two Shifts; and I have enough left for two Shirts, and two Shifts, for you, my dear Father and Mother. When I come home, I'll make 'em for you, and de&s;ire your Acceptance as my fir&s;t Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Then I bought of a Pedlar, two pretty enough round-ear'd Caps, a little Straw-hat, and a Pair of knit Mittens, turn'd up with white Calico; and two Pair of ordinary blue Wor&s;ted Ho&s;e, that make a &s;marti&s;h Appearance, with white Clocks, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; and two Yards of black Ribband for my Shift Sleeves, and to &s;erve as a Necklace; and when I had 'em all come home, I went and look'd upon them once in two Hours, for two Days together: For, you mu&s;t know, tho' I lie with Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I keep my own little Apartment &s;till for my Cloaths; and nobody goes thither but my&s;elf. You'll &s;ay, I was no bad Hou&s;ewife to have &s;av'd &s;o much Money; but my dear good Lady was always giving me &s;omething.</P>
<P>I believ'd my&s;elf the more oblig'd to do this, be|cau&s;e, as I was turn'd away for what my good Ma|&s;ter thought Want of Duty; and, as he expected other Returns for his Pre&s;ents, than I intended to make him; &s;o I thought it was but ju&s;t to leave his Pre&s;ents behind me when I went away;
<PB N="51" REF="88">
for, you know, if I would not earn his Wages, why &s;hould I have them?</P>
<P>Don't trouble your&s;elf, now I think of it, about the Four Guineas, nor borrow to make them up; for they were given me, with &s;ome Silver, as I told you, as a Perqui&s;ite, being what my Lady had about her when &s;he dy'd; and, as I hope for no other Wages, I am &s;o vain as to think I have de&s;erv'd them in the fourteen Months, &s;ince my Lady's Death: For &s;he, good Soul! overpaid me before, in Learning and other Kindne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Had <HI>&s;he</HI> liv'd, none of the&s;e Things might have happen'd!&mdash;But I ought to be thankful 'tis no wor&s;e. Every thing will turn about for the be&s;t; that's my Confidence.</P>
<P>So, as I was &s;aying, I have provided a new and more &s;uitable Dre&s;s, and I long to appear in it, more than ever I did in any new Cloaths in my Life; for then I &s;hall be &s;oon after with you, and at Ea&s;e in my Mind.&mdash;But, mum&mdash;I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Said &s;he, I have had a World of Talk with my Ma&s;ter about you. I am &s;orry for it, &s;aid I, that I am made of &s;o much Con&s;equence as to be talk'd
<PB N="52" REF="89">
of by him. O, &s;aid &s;he, I mu&s;t not tell you all; but you are of more Con&s;equence to him, than you think for &mdash;</P>
<P>Or <HI>wi&s;h</HI> for, &s;aid I; for the Fruits of being of Con|&s;equence to him, would make me of none to my&s;elf, or any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Said &s;he, Thou art as witty as any Lady in the Land: I wonder where thou gotte&s;t it. But they mu&s;t be poor Ladies, with &s;uch great Opportunities, I am &s;ure, if they have no more than I.&mdash;But let that pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, that I am of &s;o much Con&s;e|quence, however, as to vex him, if it be but to think, he can't make a Fool of &s;uch a one as I; and that is nothing at all, but a Rebuke to the Pride of his high Condition, which he did not expect, and knows not how to put up with.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in that, may-be, &s;aid &s;he; but indeed, <HI>Pamela,</HI> he is very angry at you <HI>too</HI>; and calls you twenty perver&s;e Things; wonders at his own Folly, to have &s;hewn you &s;o much Favour, as he calls it; which he was fir&s;t inclin'd to, he &s;ays, for his Mother's &s;ake, and would have per&s;i&s;ted to &s;hew you for your own, if you was not your own Enemy.</P>
<P>Nay, now I &s;han't love you, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I; you are going to per&s;uade me to ask to &s;tay, tho' you know the Hazards I run.&mdash;No, &s;aid &s;he, he &s;ays you <HI>&s;hall</HI> go; for he thinks it won't be for his Reputation to keep you: But he wi&s;h'd (don't &s;peak of it for the World, <HI>Pamela</HI>) that he knew a Lady of Birth, ju&s;t &s;uch another as your&s;elf, in Per&s;on and Mind, and he would marry her To|morrow.</P>
<P>I colour'd up to the Ears at this Word; but &s;aid, Yet if I was the Lady of Birth, and he would offer to be rude fir&s;t, as he has twice done to poor me,
<PB N="53" REF="90">
I don't know whether I would have him: For <HI>&s;he</HI> that can bear an In&s;ult of that kind, I &s;hould think not worthy to be any Gentleman's Wife; any more than <HI>he</HI> would be a Gentleman that would offer it.</P>
<P>Nay, now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, thou carrie&s;t thy No|tions a great way. Well, dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, very &s;eriou&s;ly, for I could not help it, I am more full of Fears than ever. I have only to beg of you, as one of the be&s;t Friends I have in the World, to &s;ay no|thing of my asking to &s;tay. To &s;ay my Ma&s;ter likes me, when I know what End he aims at, is Abomina|tion to my Ears; and I &s;han't think my&s;elf &s;afe till I am at my poor Father's and Mother's.</P>
<P>She was a little angry at me, 'till I a&s;&s;ured her, that I had not the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s on her Account, but thought my&s;elf &s;afe under her Protection and Friend&s;hip. And &s;o we dropt the Di&s;cour&s;e for that Time.</P>
<P>I hope to have fini&s;h'd this ugly Wai&s;tcoat in two Days; after which, I have only &s;ome Linen to get up, and do &s;omething to, and &s;hall then let you know how I &s;hall contrive as to my Pa&s;&s;age; for the heavy Rains will make it &s;ad travelling on Foot: But may|be I may get a Place to &mdash;, which is ten Miles of the Way, in Farmer <HI>Nichols</HI>'s clo&s;e Cart; for I can't &s;it a Hor&s;e well at all.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL my Fellow-&s;ervants have now &s;ome Notion, that I am to go away; but can't imagine for what. Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> tells them, that my Father and Mother, growing in Years, cannot live without me; and &s;o I go to them, to help to comfort their old Age; but they &s;eem not to believe it.</P>
<P>What they found it out by, was, the Butler heard him &s;ay to me, as I pa&s;s'd by him, in the Entry lead|ing to the Hall, Who's that's? <HI>Pamela,</HI> Sir, &s;aid I&punc; <HI>Pamela</HI>! &s;aid he, How long are <HI>you</HI> to &s;tay here? &mdash; Only, plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid I, till I have done the Wai&s;tcoat; and it is almo&s;t done. &mdash; You might, &s;ays he, (very roughly indeed) have fini&s;hed that long enough ago, I &s;hould have thought. In|deed, and plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid I, I have work'd early and late upon it; there is a great deal of Work in it. &mdash; <HI>Work in it!</HI> &s;aid he; yes, you mind your Pen more than your Needle; I don't want &s;uch idle Sluts to &s;tay in my Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd &s;tartled, when he &s;aw the Butler. As he enter'd the Hall, where Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;tood, What do <HI>you</HI> here? &s;aid he.&mdash;The Butler was as much con|founded as I; for I, never having been tax'd &s;o roughly, could not help crying &s;adly; and got out of both their ways to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and told my Com|plaint. This Love, &s;aid &s;he, is the D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l! in how many &s;trange Shapes does it make People &s;hew them&s;elves? And in &s;ome the farthe&s;t from their Hearts.</P>
<P>So one, and then another, has been &s;ince whi&s;per|ing, Pray, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> are we to lo&s;e Mrs. <HI>Pamela?</HI> as they always call me &mdash;What has &s;he done? And
<PB N="55" REF="92">
then &s;he tells them as above, about going home to you.</P>
<P>She &s;aid afterwards to me, Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you have made our Ma&s;ter, from the &s;weete&s;t-temper'd Gentleman in the World, one of the mo&s;t peevi&s;h. But you have it in your Power to make him as &s;weet-temper'd as ever; tho' I hope you'll never do it on his Terms.</P>
<P>This was very good in Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; but it inti|mated, that &s;he thought as ill of his De&s;igns as I; and as &s;he knew his Mind more than I, it convinced me, that I ought to get away as fa&s;t as I could.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter came in, ju&s;t now, to &s;peak to Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> about Hou&s;hold Matters, having &s;ome Com|pany to dine with him To-morrow; and I &s;tood up, and having, been crying, at his Roughne&s;s in the En|try, I turn'd away my Face.</P>
<P>You may well, &s;aid he, turn away your cur&s;ed Face; I wi&s;h I had never &s;een it! &mdash; Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> how long is &s;he to be about this Wai&s;tcoat?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, if your Honour had plea&s;ed, I would have taken it with me; and tho' it would be now fini&s;h'd in a few Hours, I will do &s;o &s;till; and remove this hated poor <HI>Pamela</HI> out of your Hou&s;e and Sight for ever.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid he, not &s;peaking to me, I believe this little Slut has the Power of Witchcraft, if ever there was a Witch; for &s;he inchants all that come near her. She makes even <HI>you,</HI> who &s;hould know better what the World is, think her an Angel of Light.</P>
<P>I offer'd to go away; for I believ'd he wanted me to ask to &s;tay in my Place, for all this his great Wrath; and he &s;aid, Stay here! &s;tay here, when I bid you! and &s;natch'd my Hand. I trembled, and &s;aid, I will! I will! for he hurt my Fingers, he gra&s;ped me &s;o hard.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="93">He &s;eem'd to have a mind to &s;ay &s;omething to me; but broke off abruptly, and &s;aid, Begone! And away I tripp'd, as fa&s;t as I could; and he and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> had a deal of Talk, as &s;he told me; and among the re&s;t, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf vex'd to have &s;poken in Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Hearing.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> our Butler, is a very grave good &s;ort of old Man, with his Hair as white as Silver! and an hone&s;t worthy Man he is. I was hurrying out with a Flea in my Ear, as the Saying is, and going down Stairs into the Par|lour, met him. He took hold of my Hand, (in a gentler manner tho' than my Ma&s;ter) with both his; and he &s;aid, Ah! &s;weet, &s;weet Mrs. <HI>Pamela!</HI> what is it I heard ju&s;t now! &mdash;I am &s;orry at my Heart; but I am &s;ure I will &s;ooner believe <HI>any body</HI> in Fault than <HI>you.</HI> Thank you, Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> &s;aid I; but as you value your Place, don't be &s;een &s;peaking to &s;uch a one as me. I cry'd too; and &s;lipt away as fa&s;t as I could from him, for his own &s;ake, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;een to pity me.</P>
<P>And now I will give you an In&s;tance how much I am in Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>'s E&s;teem al&s;o.</P>
<P>I had lo&s;t my Pen &s;ome-how; and my Paper being written out, I &s;tepp'd to Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>'s our Steward's Office, to beg him to give me a Pen or two, and a Sheet or two of Paper. He &s;aid, Ay, that I will, my &s;weet Maiden! And gave me three Pens, &s;ome Wa|fers, a Stick of Wax, and twelve Sheets of Paper; and coming from his Desk, where be was writing, he &s;aid, Let me have a Word or two with you, my &s;weet little Mi&s;tre&s;s (for &s;o the&s;e two good old Gentlemen often call me; for I believe they love me dearly): I hear bad News; that we are going to lo&s;e you: I hope it is not true? Yes, it is, Sir, &s;aid I; but I was in Hopes it would not be known till I went away.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="94">What a D&mdash;l, &s;aid he, ails our Ma&s;ter of late! I never &s;aw &s;uch an Alteration in any Man in my Life! He is pleas'd with nobody, as I &s;ee; And by what Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI> tells me ju&s;t now, he was quite out of the way with you. What could <HI>you</HI> have done to him, tro'? Only Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> is a very good Wo|man; or I &s;hould have fear'd <HI>&s;he</HI> had been your Enemy.</P>
<P>No, &s;aid I, nothing like it. Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> is a ju&s;t good Woman, and, next to my Father and Mother, the be&s;t Friend I have in the World.&mdash;Well then, &s;aid he, it mu&s;t be wor&s;e. Shall I gue&s;s? You are too <HI>pretty,</HI> my &s;weet Mi&s;tre&s;s, and, may-be, too <HI>virtuous.</HI> Ah! have I not hit it? No, good Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, don't think any thing ami&s;s of my Ma&s;ter; he is cro&s;s and angry with me indeed, that's true; but I may have given Occa&s;ion for it, may-be; and becau&s;e I am obliged to go to my Father and Mo|ther, rather than &s;tay here, may-hap, he may think me ungrateful. But, you know, Sir, &s;aid I, that a Father and Mother's Comfort is the deare&s;t thing to a good Child that can be. Sweet Excellence! &s;aid he, this becomes <HI>you</HI>; but I know the World and Man|kind too well; tho' I mu&s;t hear, and &s;ee, and &s;ay no|thing! And a Ble&s;&s;ing attend my little Sweeting, &s;aid he, where-ever you go! And away went I, with a Curt'&s;y and Thanks.</P>
<P>Now this plea&s;es one, my dear Father and Mother, to be &s;o belov'd.&mdash;How much better, by good Fame and Integrity, is it to get every one's good Word but <HI>one,</HI> than by <HI>plea&s;ing that one,</HI> to make <HI>every one el&s;e</HI> one's Enemy, and be an execrable Creature be&s;ides!

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE had a great many neighbouring Gentlemen, and their Ladies, this Day at Dinner; and my Ma&s;ter made a fine Entertainment for them. And <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> waited at Table. And <HI>I&s;aac</HI> tells Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that the Ladies will by-and-by come to &s;ee the Hou&s;e, and have the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee me; for it &s;eems, they &s;aid to my Ma&s;ter, when the Jokes flew about, Well, Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;, we under&s;tand, you have a Servant-maid, who is the greate&s;t Beauty in the County; and we promi&s;e our|&s;elves to &s;ee her before we go.</P>
<P>The Wench is well enough, &s;aid he; but no &s;uch Beauty as you talk of, I'll a&s;&s;ure ye. She was my Mother's Waiting-maid, who, on her Death-bed, en|gag'd me to be kind to her, She is young, and every thing is <HI>pretty</HI> that is <HI>young.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, ay, &s;aid one of the Ladies, that's true; but if your Mother had <HI>not</HI> recommended her &s;o &s;trongly, there is &s;o much Merit in Beauty, that I make no doubt &s;uch a fine Gentleman would have wanted no &s;uch &s;trong Inducement to be kind.</P>
<P>They all laugh'd at my Ma&s;ter: And he, it &s;eems, laugh'd for Company; but &s;aid, I don't know how it is, but I &s;ee with different Eyes from other People; for I have heard much more Talk of her Prettine&s;s, than I think it de&s;erves: She is well enough, as I &s;aid; but I think her greate&s;t Excellence is, that &s;he is humble, and courteous, and faithful, and makes all her Fellow-&s;ervants love her: My Hou&s;e-keeper, in particular, doats upon her; and you know, Ladies, &s;he is a Woman of Di&s;cernment: And, as for Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> here, if they thought
<PB N="59" REF="96">
them&s;elves young enough, I am told, they would fight for her. Is it not true, <HI>Jonathan?</HI> Troth, Sir, &s;aid he, an't plea&s;e your Honour, I never knew her Peer, and all your Honour's Family are of the &s;ame Mind. Do you hear now? &s;aid my Ma&s;ter&mdash;Well, &s;aid the Ladies, we will make a Vi&s;it to Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> by-and-by, and hope to &s;ee this Paragon.</P>
<P>I believe they are coming; and will tell you more by-and-by. I wi&s;h they had come, and were gone. Why can't they make their Game without me?</P>
<P>Well, the&s;e fine Ladies have been here, and gone back again. I would have been ab&s;ent if I could, and did &s;tep into the Clo&s;et; &s;o they &s;aw me not when they came in.</P>
<P>There were four of them, Lady <HI>Arthur</HI> at the great white Hou&s;e on the Hill, Lady <HI>Brookes,</HI> Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> and the other, it &s;eems, a Counte&s;s, of &s;ome hard Name, I forget what.</P>
<P>So, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;ays one of the Ladies, how do you do? We are all come to inquire after your Health. I am much oblig'd to your Lady&s;hips, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis:</HI> Will your Lady&s;hips plea&s;e to &s;it down? But, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, we are not <HI>only</HI> come to ask after Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Health neither; but we are come to &s;ee a Rarity be&s;ides. Ay, &s;ays Lady <HI>Arthur,</HI> I have not &s;een your <HI>Pamela</HI> the&s;e two Years, and they tell me &s;he is grown wond'rous pretty in that Time.</P>
<P>Then I wi&s;h'd I had not been in the Clo&s;et; for when I came out, they mu&s;t needs know I heard them: but I have often found, that ba&s;hful Bodies owe them&s;elves a Spite, and frequently confound them|&s;elves more, by endeavouring to avoid Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Why, yes, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Jervis, Pamela</HI> is very pretty indeed; &s;he's but in the Clo&s;et there:&mdash;<HI>Pamela,</HI> pray
<PB N="60" REF="97">
&s;tep hither. I came out, all cover'd with Blu&s;hes; and they &s;mil'd at one another.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s took me by the Hand: Why, in|deed, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, Report has not been too lavi&s;h, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. Don't be a&s;ham'd, Child (and &s;tar'd full in my Face); I wi&s;h I had ju&s;t &s;uch a Face to be a&s;ham'd of. O how like a Fool I look'd!</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Arthur</HI> &s;aid, Ay, my good <HI>Pamela,</HI> I &s;ay as her Lady&s;hip &s;ays: Don't be &s;o confus'd; tho' indeed it becomes you too. I think your good Lady de|parted made a &s;weet Choice of &s;uch a pretty Atten|dant. She would have been mighty proud of you, as &s;he always was prai&s;ing you, had &s;he liv'd till now.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, &s;aid Lady <HI>Brookes,</HI> do you think, that &s;o <HI>dutiful</HI> a Son as our Neighbour, who always <HI>admir'd</HI> what his Mother <HI>lov'd,</HI> does not pride him&s;elf, for all what he &s;aid at Table, in &s;uch a pretty Maiden?</P>
<P>She look'd with &s;uch a malicious &s;neering Counte|nance, I cannot abide her.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Towers</HI> &s;aid, with a free Air, (for it &s;eems &s;he is call'd a Wit) Well, Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> I can't &s;ay I like you &s;o well as the&s;e Ladies do; for I &s;hould never care, if you were <HI>my</HI> Servant, to have <HI>you</HI> and your <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> in the &s;ame Hou&s;e together. Then they all &s;et up a great Laugh.</P>
<P>I know what I could have &s;aid, if I dur&s;t. But they are Ladies&mdash;and Ladies may &s;ay any thing.</P>
<P>Says Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> Can the pretty Image &s;peak, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> I vow &s;he has &s;peaking Eyes! O you little Rogue, &s;aid &s;he, and tapt me on the Cheek, you &s;eem born to undo, or to be undone!</P>
<P>God forbid, and plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid I, it &s;hould be <HI>either!</HI>&mdash;I beg, &s;aid I, to withdraw; for the Sen&s;e I have of my Unworthine&s;s, renders me unfit for &s;uch a Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I then went away, with one of my be&s;t Curt'&s;ies; and Lady <HI>Towers</HI> &s;aid, as I went out, Prettily &s;aid,
<PB N="61" REF="98">
I vow!&mdash;And Lady <HI>Brookes</HI> &s;aid, See that Shape! I never &s;aw &s;uch a Face and Shape in my Life; why &s;he mu&s;t be better de&s;cended than you have told me!</P>
<P>And &s;o, belike, their Clacks ran for half an Hour in my Prai&s;es; and glad was I, when I got out of the Hearing of them.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, they went down with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Story to my Ma&s;ter, and &s;o full of <HI>me</HI>&punc; that he had much ado to &s;tand it; but as it was very little to my Reputation, I am &s;ure I could take no Pride in it; and I fear'd it would make no better for me. This gives me ano|ther Cau&s;e for wi&s;hing my&s;elf out of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This is <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, and next <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> I hope to &s;et out; for I have fini&s;h'd my Task, and my Ma&s;ter is horrid cro&s;s! And I am vex'd his Cro&s;&s;ne&s;s affects me &s;o. If ever he had any Kind|ne&s;s towards me, I believe he now hates me hear|tily.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, that Love borders &s;o much upon Hate? But this wicked Love is not like the true virtuous Love, to be &s;ure: <HI>That</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> mu&s;t be as far off, as <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI> And how mu&s;t this Hate have been increa&s;ed, if he had met with a ba&s;e Compliance, after his wicked Will had been gratify'd?</P>
<P>Well, one may &s;ee by a little, what a great deal means: For if <HI>Innocence</HI> cannot attract common Ci|vility, what mu&s;t <HI>Guilt</HI> expect, when Novelty had ceas'd to have its Charms, and Changeablene&s;s had taken place of it? Thus we read in Holy Writ, that wicked <HI>Amnon,</HI> when he had ruin'd poor <HI>Tamar,</HI> hated her more than ever he lov'd her, and would have turn'd her out of Door!</P>
<P>How happy am I, to be turn'd out of Door, with that &s;weet Companion my Innocence!&mdash;O may that be always my Companion! And while I pre|&s;ume
<PB N="62" REF="99">
not upon my own Strength, and am willing to avoid the Tempter, I hope the Divine Grace will a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P>Forgive me, that I repeat in my Letter Part of my hourly Prayer. I owe every thing, next to God's Goodne&s;s, to your Piety and good Examples, my dear Parents; my dear <HI>poor</HI> Parents, I will &s;ay, be|cau&s;e your <HI>Poverty</HI> is my <HI>Pride,</HI> as your Integrity &s;hall be my Imitation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I have din'd, I will put on my new Cloaths. I long to have them on. I know I &s;hall &s;urpri&s;e Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> with them; for &s;he &s;han't &s;ee me till I am full-dre&s;s'd.&mdash;<HI>John</HI> is come back, and I'll &s;oon &s;end you &s;ome of what I have written.&mdash; I find he is going early in the Morning; and &s;o I'll clo&s;e here, that I am</P>

<P>I am glad you did not tell him the Occa&s;ion of my coming away; for <HI>if</HI> they &s;hould gue&s;s, it were better &s;o, than to have it from you or me: Be&s;ides, I really am concern'd, that my poor Ma&s;ter &s;hould ca&s;t &s;uch a Thought upon &s;uch a Creature as me; for be&s;ides the Di&s;grace, it has quite turn'd his Temper; and I begin to think he likes me, and can't help it; and yet &s;trives to conquer it, and &s;o finds no way but to be cro&s;s to me.</P>
<P>Don't think me pre&s;umptuous and conceited; for it is more my Concern than my Pride, to &s;ee &s;uch a Gentleman &s;o demean him&s;elf, and le&s;&s;en the Regard he u&s;ed to have in the Eyes of all his Servants, on my Account.&mdash;But I am to tell you of my new Dre&s;s to|day.</P>
<P>And &s;o, when I had din'd, up Stairs I went, and lock'd my&s;elf into my little Room. There I trick'd my&s;elf up as well as I could in my new Garb, and put on my round-ear'd ordinary Cap; but with a green Knot however, and my home-&s;pun Gown and Petti|coat, and plain-leather Shoes; but yet they are what they call <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather, and my ordinary Ho&s;e, or|dinary I mean to what I have been lately u&s;ed to; tho' I &s;hall think good Yarn may do very well for every Day, when I come home. A plain Mu&s;lin Tucker I put on, and my black Silk Necklace, in&s;tead of the <HI>French</HI> Necklace my Lady gave me; and put the Ear|rings out of my Ears; and when I was quite 'quipp'd, I took my Straw Hat in my Hand, with its two blue Strings, and look'd about me in the Gla&s;s, as proud as any thing.&mdash;To &s;ay Truth, I never lik'd my&s;elf &s;o well in my Life.</P>
<P>O the Plea&s;ure of de&s;cending with Ea&s;e, Inno|cence and Re&s;ignation!&mdash;Indeed there is nothing
<PB N="64" REF="101">
like it! An humble Mind, I plainly &s;ee, cannot meet with any very &s;hocking Di&s;appointment, let Fortune's Wheel turn round as it will.</P>
<P>So I went down to look for Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> to &s;ee how &s;he lik'd me.</P>
<P>I met, as I was upon the Stairs, our <HI>Rachel,</HI> who is the Hou&s;e-maid; and &s;he made me a low Curt'&s;y, and I found did not know me. So I &s;mil'd, and went to the Hou&s;e-keeper's Parlour: And there &s;at good Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> at Work, making a Shift: And, would you believe it? &s;he did not know me at fir&s;t; but ro&s;e up, and pull'd off her Spectacles; and &s;aid, Do you want me, for&s;ooth? I could not help laugh|ing, and &s;aid. Hey-day! Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> what! don't you know me?&mdash;She &s;tood all in Amaze, and look'd at me from Top to Toe; Why, you &s;urpri&s;e me, &s;aid &s;he; what! <HI>Pamela!</HI> thus metamorphos'd! How came this about?</P>
<P>As it happen'd, in &s;tept my Ma&s;ter; and my Back being to him, he thought it was a Stranger &s;peaking to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and withdrew again; and did not hear her ask, If his Honour had any Commands with her?&mdash;She turn'd me about and about, and I &s;hew'd her all my Dre&s;s, to my Under-petticoat; and &s;he &s;aid, &s;itting down, Why, I am all in Amaze: I mu&s;t &s;it down. What can all this mean. I told her, I had no Cloaths &s;uitable to my Condition when I return'd to my Father's; and &s;o it was better to begin here, as I was &s;oon to go away, that all my Fellow-&s;ervants might &s;ee I knew how to &s;uit my&s;elf to the State I was returning to.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, I never knew the like of thee. But this &s;ad Preparation for going away (for now I &s;ee you are quite in Earne&s;t) is what I know not how to get over. O my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> how can I part with you!</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter rung in the Back-parlour, and &s;o I withdrew, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> went to attend him. It
<PB N="65" REF="102">
&s;eems he &s;aid to her, I was coming in to let you know that I &s;hall go to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and may-be to my Si&s;ter <HI>Davers</HI>'s, and be ab&s;ent &s;ome Weeks. But, pray, what pretty neat Dam&s;el was with you? She &s;ays, &s;he &s;miled, and ask'd, If his Honour did not know who it was? No, &s;aid he, I never &s;aw her before. Farmer <HI>Nichols,</HI> or Farmer <HI>Brady,</HI> have neither of them &s;uch a tight prim La&s;s for a Daughter; have they?&mdash;Tho' I did not &s;ee her Face neither, &s;aid he. If your Honour won't be angry, &s;aid &s;he, I will in|troduce her into your Pre&s;ence; for, I think, &s;ays &s;he, &s;he out-does our <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
<P>Now I did not thank her for this, as I told her after|wards (for it brought a great deal of Trouble upon me, as well as Cro&s;&s;ne&s;s, as you &s;hall hear). That can't be, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay. But if you can find an Ex|cu&s;e for it, let her come in.</P>
<P>At that &s;he &s;tept to me, and told me, I mu&s;t go in with her to my Ma&s;ter; but, &s;aid &s;he, for Goodne&s;s &s;ake, let him find you out; for he don't know you. O fie, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, how could you &s;erve me &s;o? Be&s;ides, it looks too free both <HI>in me,</HI> and <HI>to him.</HI> I tell you, &s;aid &s;he, you <HI>&s;hall</HI> come in; and pray don't reveal your&s;elf till he finds you out.</P>
<P>So I went in, fooli&s;h as I was; tho' I mu&s;t have been &s;een by him another time, if I had not then. And &s;he would make me take my Straw-hat in my Hand.</P>
<P>I dropt a low Curt'&s;y, but &s;aid never a Word. I dare &s;ay, he knew me as &s;oon as he &s;aw my Face; but was as cunning as <HI>Lucifer.</HI> He came up to me, and took me by the Hand, and &s;aid, Who&s;e pretty Maiden are you?&mdash;I dare &s;ay you are <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Si&s;ter, you are &s;o like her. So neat, &s;o clean, &s;o pretty! Why, Child, you far &s;urpa&s;s your Si&s;ter <HI>Pamela!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="103">I was all Confu&s;ion, and would have &s;poken; but he took me about the Neck; Why, &s;aid he, you are very pretty, Child; I would not be &s;o free with your <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> you may believe; but I mu&s;t ki&s;s <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid I, I am <HI>Pamela,</HI> indeed I am: Indeed I am <HI>Pamela, her own &s;elf!</HI></P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed me for all I could do; and &s;aid, Impo&s;|&s;ible! you are a lovelier Girl by half than <HI>Pamela</HI>; and &s;ure I may be innocently free with you, tho' I would not do her &s;o much Favour.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Bite upon me indeed, and what I could not expect; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> look'd like a Fool as much as I, for her Officiou&s;ne&s;s &mdash;At la&s;t I got away, and ran out of the Parlour, mo&s;t &s;adly vex'd, as you may well think.</P>
<P>He talk'd a good deal to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and at la&s;t order'd me to come in to him. Come in, &s;aid he, you little Villain! for &s;o he call'd me; good Sirs! what a Name was there! Who is it you put your Tricks upon? I was re&s;olved never to honour your Unworthine&s;, &s;aid he, with &s;o much Notice again; and &s;o you mu&s;t di&s;gui&s;e your&s;elf, to attract me, and yet pretend, like an Hypocrite as you are&mdash;</P>
<P>I was out of Patience, then; Hold, good Sir, &s;aid I; don't impure Di&s;gui&s;e and Hypocri&s;y to me, above all things; for hate them both, mean as I am I have put on no Di&s;gui&s;e.&mdash;What, a-plague, &s;aid he, for that was his Word, do you mean then by this Dre&s;s?&mdash;Why, and plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid I, I mean one of the hone&s;te&s;t things in the World. I have been in Di&s;gui&s;e indeed ever &s;ince my good Lady your Mother took me from my poor Parents. I came to her Lady&s;hip &s;o poor and mean, that the&s;e Cloaths I have on, are a princely-Suit, to tho&s;e I had then. And her Goodne&s;s heap'd upon me rich Cloaths, and other Bounties: And as I am now re|turning to my poor Parents again &s;o &s;oon, I cannot
<PB N="67" REF="104">
wear tho&s;e good things without being whooted at; and &s;o have bought what will be more &s;uitable to my Degree, and be a good Holiday Suit too, when I get home.</P>
<P>He then took me in his Arms, and pre&s;ently pu&s;h'd me from him. Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he, take the little Witch from me; I can neither bear, nor forbear her! (Strange Words the&s;e!)&mdash;But &s;tay; you &s;han't go!&mdash; Yet begone!&mdash;No, come back again.</P>
<P>I thought he was mad, for my Share; for he knew not what he would have. But I was going however, and he &s;tept after me, and took hold of my Arm, and brought me in again: I am &s;ure he made my Arm black and blue; for the Marks are upon it &s;till. Sir, Sir, &s;aid I, pray have Mercy; I will, I will come in!</P>
<P>He &s;at down, and look'd at me, and, as I thought afterwards, as &s;illily as &s;uch a poor Girl as I. At la&s;t, he &s;aid. Well, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> as I was telling you, you may permit her to &s;tay a little longer, till I &s;ee if my Si&s;ter <HI>Davers</HI> will have her; if, mean time, &s;he humble her&s;elf, and ask this as a Favour, and is &s;orry for her Pertne&s;s, and the Liberty &s;he has taken with my Character, out of the Hou&s;e and in the Hou&s;e. Your Honour indeed told me &s;o, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; but I never found her inclinable to think her&s;elf in a Fault. Pride and Perver&s;ene&s;s, &s;aid he, with a Vengeance! Yet this is your Doat|ing-piece!&mdash;Well, for once I'll &s;ubmit my&s;elf, to tell you, Hu&s;&s;y, &s;aid he to me, you may &s;tay a Fort|night longer, till I &s;ee my Si&s;ter <HI>Davers:</HI> Do you hear what I &s;ay to you, Statue! Can you neither &s;peak, nor be thankful?&mdash;Your Honour frights me &s;o, &s;aid I, that I can hardly &s;peak: But I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that I have only to beg, as a Favour, that I may go to my Father and Mother.&mdash;Why,
<PB N="68" REF="105">
Fool, &s;aid he, won't you like to go to wait on my Si&s;ter <HI>Davers?</HI> Sir, &s;aid I, I was once fond of that Honour; but you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I might be in Danger from her Lady&s;hip's Nephew, or he from me.&mdash; D&mdash;d Impertinence! &s;aid he; do you hear, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> do you hear, how &s;he retorts upon me? Was ever &s;uch matchle&s;s A&s;&s;urance!&mdash;</P>
<P>I then fell a weeping; for Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid, Fie, <HI>Pa|mela,</HI> fie! &mdash;And I &s;aid, My Lot is very hard indeed! I am &s;ure I would hurt nobody; and I have been, it &s;eems, guilty of Indi&s;cretions, which have co&s;t me my Place, and my Ma&s;ter's Favour, and &s;o have been turn'd away. And when the Time is come, that I &s;hould return to my poor Parents, I am not &s;uffered to go quietly. Good your Honour, what have I done, that I mu&s;t be u&s;ed wor&s;e than if I had robb'd you!&mdash; Robb'd me! &s;aid he, why &s;o you have, Hu&s;&s;y; you <HI>have</HI> robb'd me. Who! I, Sir! &s;aid I; have I robb'd you? Why then you are a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and may &s;end me to Gaol, if you plea&s;e, and bring me to a Tryal for my Life! If you can prove that I have robb'd you, I am &s;ure I ought to die.</P>
<P>Now I was quite ignorant of his Meaning; tho' I did not like it, when it was afterwards explain'd, nei|ther; and, well, thought I, what will this come to at la&s;t, if poor <HI>Pamela</HI> is e&s;teem'd a Thief! Then I thought, in an In&s;tant, how I &s;hould &s;hew my Face to my hone&s;t poor Parents, if I was but &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;aid I, let me ask you but one Que&s;tion, and pray don't let me be called Names for it; for I don't mean di&s;re&s;pectfully; Why, if I have done ami&s;s, am I not left to be di&s;charged by your Hou&s;e|keeper, as the other Maids have been? And if <HI>Jane,</HI> or <HI>Rachel,</HI> or <HI>Hannah,</HI> were to offend, would your Honour &s;toop to take Notice of them? And why &s;hould you &s;o demean your&s;elf to take Notice of

me? Pray, Sir, if I have not been wor&s;e than others, why &s;hould I &s;uffer more than others? and why &s;hould I not be turn'd away, and there's an End of it? For indeed I am not of Con&s;equence enough for my Ma&s;ter to concern him&s;elf and be angry about &s;uch a Creature as me.</P>
<P>Do you hear, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> cry'd he again, how pertly I am interrrogated by this &s;aucy Slut? Why, Sauce-box, &s;ays he, did not my good Mother de&s;ire me to take care of you? And have you not been always di&s;tingui&s;h'd by me, above a common Ser|vant? And does your Ingratitude upbraid me for this?</P>
<P>I &s;aid &s;omething mutteringly, and he vow'd he would hear it. I begg'd Excu&s;e; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it. Why then, &s;aid I, if your Honour mu&s;t know, I &s;aid, That my good Lady did not de&s;ire your Care to extend to the <HI>Summer-hou&s;e</HI> and her <HI>Dre&s;&s;ing-room.</HI></P>
<P>Well, this was a little &s;aucy, you'll &s;ay!&mdash;And he flew into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that I was forced to run &s;or it; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid, It was happy I got out of his Way.</P>
<P>Why what makes him provoke one &s;o, then?&mdash; I'm almo&s;t &s;orry for it; but I would be glad to get away at any rate. For I begin to be more fearful now.</P>

I can neither write as I &s;hould do, nor let it alone; for to whom but you can I vent my Griefs, and keep my poor Heart from bur&s;ting! Wicked, wicked Man! &mdash; I have no Patience left me! &mdash; But yet, don't be frighted&mdash; for&mdash; I hope&mdash; I hope, I am hone&s;t!&mdash; But if my Head and my Heart will let me, you &s;hall hear all.&mdash;Is there no Con&s;table nor Headborough, tho', to take me out of his Hou&s;e? for I am &s;ure I can &s;afely &s;wear the Peace again&s;t him: But, alas! he is greater than any Con&s;table, and is a Ju&s;tice him&s;elf; &s;uch a Ju&s;tice, deliver me from!&mdash;But God Almighty, I hope, in time, will right me!&mdash; For he knows the Innocence of my Heart!</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> went your way in the Morning; but I have been too much di&s;tracted to &s;end by him; and have
<PB N="71" REF="108">
&s;een nobody but Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and <HI>Rachel,</HI> and one I hate to &s;ee: And indeed I hate now to &s;ee any body. Strange things I have to tell you, that happen'd &s;ince la&s;t Night, that good Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Letter, and my Ma&s;ter's Har&s;hne&s;s, put me into &s;uch a Flu&s;ter. But I will no more <HI>preambulate.</HI></P>
<P>I went to Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Chamber; and, O my dear Father and Mother, my wicked Ma&s;ter had hid him&s;elf, ba&s;e Gentleman as he is! in her Clo&s;et, where &s;he has a few Books, and Che&s;t of Drawers, and &s;uch-like. I little &s;u&s;pected it; tho' I u&s;ed, till this &s;ad Night, always to look into that Clo&s;et, and another in the Room, and under the Bed, ever &s;ince the Summer-hou&s;e Trick, but never found any thing; and &s;o I did not do it then, being fully re&s;olved to be angry with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> for what had happened in the Day, and &s;o thought of no|thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;at my&s;elf down on one Side of the Bed, and &s;he on the other, and we began to undre&s;s our&s;elves; but &s;he on that Side next the wicked Clo&s;et, that held the wor&s;t Heart in the World. So, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> you won't &s;peak to me, <HI>Pamela!</HI> I find you are angry with me. Why, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, &s;o I am, a little; 'tis a Folly to deny it. You &s;ee what I have &s;uffer'd by your forcing me in to my Ma&s;ter: And a Gentlewoman of your Years and Experience mu&s;t needs know, that it was not fit for me to pretend to be any body el&s;e for my own &s;ake, nor with regard to my Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid &s;he, who would have thought it would have turn'd out &s;o? Ay, &s;aid I, little thinking who heard me, <HI>Lucifer</HI> always is ready to promote his own Work and Workmen. You &s;ee, pre&s;ently, what U&s;e he made of it, pretending not to know me, on purpo&s;e to be free with me: And when he took upon him&s;elf to know me, to quarrel with me, and u&s;e me hardly; And you too, &s;aid I, to cry, Fie, fie,
<PB N="72" REF="109">
<HI>Pamela!</HI> cut me to the Heart: For that encouraged him.</P>
<P>Do you think, my Dear, &s;aid &s;he, that I would encourage him? &mdash;I never &s;aid &s;o to you before; but &s;ince you force it from me, I mu&s;t tell you, that ever &s;ince you con&s;ulted me, I have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t Endeavours to divert him from his wicked Purpo&s;es: And he has promi&s;ed fair; but, to &s;ay all in a Word, he doats upon you; and I begin to &s;ee it is not in his Power to help it.</P>
<P>I luckily &s;aid nothing of the Note from Mr. <HI>Jo|nathan</HI>; for I began to &s;u&s;pect all the World almo&s;t: But I &s;aid, to try Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> Well then, what would you have me do? You &s;ee he is for having me wait on Lady <HI>Davers</HI> now.</P>
<P>Why, I'll tell you freely, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and I tru&s;t to your Di&s;cretion to conceal what I &s;ay: My Ma&s;ter has been often de&s;iring me to put you upon asking him to let you &s;tay.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid I, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> let me interrupt you: I will tell you why I could not think of that: It was not the Pride of my <HI>Heart</HI>; but the Pride of my <HI>Hone&s;ty:</HI> For, what mu&s;t have been the Ca&s;e? Here my Ma&s;ter has been very rude to me, once and twice; and you &s;ay he cannot help it, though he pretends to be &s;orry for it: Well, he has given me Warning to leave my Place, and u&s;es me very har&s;hly; perhaps, to frighten me to his Purpo&s;es, as he &s;uppo&s;es I would be fond of &s;taying (as in|deed I &s;hould, if I could be &s;afe; for I love you and all the Hou&s;e, and value him, if he would act as my Ma&s;ter). Well then, as I know his De|&s;igns, and that he owns he cannot help it; mu&s;t I not have ask'd to &s;tay, knowing he would attempt me again? for all you could a&s;&s;ure me of, was, he would do nothing by <HI>Force</HI>; &s;o I, a poor weak Girl, was to be left to my own Strength! And was not this
<PB N="73" REF="110">
to <HI>allow</HI> him to tempt me, as one may &s;ay? and to encourage him to go on in his wicked Devices? &mdash; How then, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> could I ask or wi&s;h to &s;tay?</P>
<P>You &s;ay well, my dear Child, &s;ays &s;he; and you have a Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought above your Years; and for all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and for what I have heard this Day, after you ran away, (and I am glad you went as you did) I cannot per&s;uade you to &s;tay; and I &s;hall be glad, which is what I never thought I could have &s;aid, that you were well at your Father's; for if Lady <HI>Davers</HI> will entertain you, &s;he may as well have you from thence as here. There's my good Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI> &s;aid I; God will ble&s;s you for your good Coun&s;el to a poor Maiden, that is hard be|&s;et. But pray what did he &s;ay, when I was gone.? Why, &s;ays &s;he, he was very angry with you. But he would hear it I &s;aid I: I think it was a little bold; but then he provoked me to it. And had not my Ho|ne&s;ty been in the Ca&s;e, I would not by any means have been &s;o &s;aucy. Be&s;ides, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> con&s;ider, it was the Truth; if he does not love to hear of the <HI>Summer-hou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Dre&s;&s;ing-room,</HI> why &s;hould he not be a&s;hamed to continue in the &s;ame Mind? But, &s;aid &s;he, when you had muttered this to your&s;elf, you might have told him any thing el&s;e. Well, &s;aid I, I cannot tell a wilful Lye, and &s;o there's an End of it. But I find you now give him up, and think there's Dan|ger in &s;taying. &mdash; Lord ble&s;s me! I wi&s;h I was well our of the Hou&s;e; &s;o it was at the Bottom of a wet Ditch, on the wilde&s;t Common in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Why, &s;aid &s;he, it &s;ignifies nothing to tell you all he &s;aid; but it was enough to make me fear you would not be &s;o &s;afe as I could wi&s;h; and, upon my Word, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I don't wonder he loves you; for, without Flattery, you are a charming Girl! and I never &s;aw you look more lovely in my Life, than in

that &s;ame new Dre&s;s of yours. And then it was &s;uch a Surprize upon us all! &mdash; I believe truly, you owe &s;ome of your Danger to the lovely <HI>Appearance</HI> you made. Then, &s;aid I, I wi&s;h the Cloaths in the Fire. I expected <HI>no</HI> Effect from them; but if <HI>any,</HI> a quite contrary one.</P>
<P>Hu&s;h! &s;aid I, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> did you not hear &s;ome|thing &s;tir in the Clo&s;et? No, &s;illy Girl! &s;aid &s;he; your Fears are always awake. &mdash; But indeed, &s;aid I, I think I heard &s;omething ru&s;tle. &mdash; May-be, &s;ays &s;he, the Cat may be got there: But I hear nothing.</P>
<P>I was hu&s;h; but &s;he &s;aid, Pr'ythee, my good Girl, make ha&s;te to-bed. See if the Door be fa&s;t. So I did, and was thinking to look in the Clo&s;et; but hearing no more Noi&s;e, thought it needle&s;s, and &s;o went again and &s;at my&s;elf down on the Bed-&s;ide, and went on un|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf. And Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> being by this time undre&s;s'd, &s;tept into Bed, and bid me ha&s;ten, for &s;he was &s;leepy.</P>
<P>I don't know what was the Matter; but my Heart &s;adly mi&s;gave me; but Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Note was enough to make it do &s;o, with what Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> had &s;aid. I pulled off my Stays, and my Stockens, and all my Cloaths to an Under-petticoat; and then hear|ing a ru&s;tling again in the Clo&s;et, I &s;aid, Heaven pro|tect us! but before I &s;ay my Prayers, I mu&s;t look into this Clo&s;et. And &s;o was going to it &s;lip-&s;hod, when, O dreadfull out ru&s;h'd my Ma&s;ter, in a rich &s;ilk and &s;ilver Morning Gown.</P>
<P>I &s;cream'd, and ran to the Bed; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;cream'd too; and he &s;aid, I'll do you no Harm, if you forbear this Noi&s;e; but otherwi&s;e take what follows.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly he came to the Bed, (for I had crept into it, to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> with my Coat on, and my Shoes) and, taking me in his Arms, &s;aid, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> ri&s;e, and ju&s;t &s;tep up Stairs, to keep the Maids from
<PB N="75" REF="112">
coming down at this Noi&s;e; I'll do no Harm to this Rebel.</P>
<P>O, for Heaven's &s;ake! for Pity's &s;ake! Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, if I am not betray'd, don't leave me; and, I be&s;eech you, rai&s;e all the Hou&s;e. No, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I will not &s;tir, my dear Lamb; I will not leave you. I wonder at you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he; and kindly threw her&s;elf upon my Coat, cla&s;ping me round the Wai&s;t; you &s;hall not hurt this Innocent, &s;aid &s;he; for I will lo&s;e my Life in her Defence. Are there not, &s;aid &s;he, enough wicked ones in the World, for your ba&s;e Pur|po&s;e, but you mu&s;t attempt &s;uch a Lamb as this?</P>
<P>He was de&s;perate angry, and threaten'd to throw her out of the Window; and to turn her out of the Hou&s;e the next Morning. You need not, Sir, &s;aid &s;he; for I will not &s;tay in it. God defend my poor <HI>Pamela</HI> till To-morrow, and we will both go together.&mdash;Says he, let me but expo&s;tulate a Word or two with you, <HI>Pa|mela.</HI> Pray, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> don't hear a Word, except he leaves the Bed, and goes to the other End of the Room. Ay, out of the Room, &s;aid I; ex|po&s;tulate To-morrow, if you mu&s;t expo&s;tulate!</P>
<P>I found his Hand in my Bo&s;om, and when my Fright let me know it, I was ready to die; and I &s;ighed, and &s;creamed, and fainted away. And &s;till he had his Arms about my Neck; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was about my Feet, and upon my Coat. And all in a cold, clammy Sweat was I. <HI>Pamela! Pamela!</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> as &s;he tells me &s;ince, O&mdash;h, and gave another Shriek, my poor <HI>Pamela</HI> is dead for certain! &mdash; And &s;o, to be &s;ure, I was for a time; for I knew nothing more of the Matter, one Fit following another, till about three Hours after, as it prov'd to be, I found my&s;elf in Bed, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;itting up on one &s;ide, with her Wrapper about her, and <HI>Rachel</HI> on the other; and no Ma&s;ter, for the wicked Wretch was gone. But I was &s;o overjoy'd, that
<PB N="76" REF="113">
I hardly could believe my&s;elf; and I &s;aid, which were my fir&s;t Words, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Rachel,</HI> can I be <HI>&s;ure</HI> it is you? Tell me! can I?&mdash;Where have I been? Hu&s;h, my Dear, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; you have been in Fit after Fit. I never &s;aw any body &s;o frightful in my Life!</P>
<P>By this I judg'd Mrs. <HI>Rachel</HI> knew nothing of the Matter; and it &s;eems my wicked Ma&s;ter had, upon Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s &s;econd Noi&s;e on my fainting away, &s;lipt out, and, as if he had come from his own Chamber, di&s;turb'd by the Screaming, went up to the Maids Room, (who hearing the Noi&s;e, lay trembling, and afraid to &s;tir) and bid them go down and &s;ee what was the Matter with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and me. And he charg'd Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and promi&s;ed to forgive her for what &s;he had &s;aid and done, if &s;he would conceal the Matter. So the Maids came down; for the Men lie in the Out|hou&s;es; and all went up again, when I came to my&s;elf a little, except <HI>Rachel,</HI> who &s;taid to &s;it up with me, and bear Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> Company. I believe they all gue&s;s the Matter to be bad enough; tho' they dare not &s;ay any thing.</P>
<P>When I think of my Danger, and the Freedoms he actually took, tho' I believe Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aved me from wor&s;e, and &s;he &s;ays he did, (tho' what can I think, who was in a Fit, and knew nothing of the Matter?) I am almo&s;t di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I was afraid of Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; but I am fully &s;atisfy'd &s;he is very good, and I &s;hould have been lo&s;t but for her; and &s;he takes on grievou&s;ly about it. What would have become of me, had &s;he gone out of the Room, to &s;till the Maids, as he bid her. He'd certainly have &s;hut her out, and then, Mercy on me! what would have become of your poor <HI>Pamela?</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t leave off a little; for my Eyes and my Head are &s;adly bad. &mdash;This was a dreadful Trial! This was

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did not ri&s;e till Ten o'Clock, and I had all the Concerns and Wi&s;hes of the Family, and Multi|tudes of Inquiries about me. My wicked Ma&s;ter went out early to hunt; but left Word, he would be in to Breakfa&s;t. And &s;o he was.</P>
<P>He came up to our Chamber about Eleven, and had nothing to do to be &s;orry: for he was our <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o put on &s;harp Anger at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I had great Emotions at his entering the Room, and threw my Apron over my Head, and fell a crying, as if my Heart would break.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;ince I know <HI>you,</HI> and you <HI>me</HI> &s;o well, I don't know how we &s;hall live together for the future. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I will take the Liberty to &s;ay what I think is be&s;t for both. I have &s;o much Grief, that you &s;hould attempt to do any Injury to this poor Girl, and e&s;pecially in my Chamber, that I &s;hould think my&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary to the Mi&s;chief, if I was not to take Notice of it. Tho' my Ruin therefore may de|pend upon it, I de&s;ire not to &s;tay; but pray let poor <HI>Pamela</HI> and me go together. With all my Heart, &s;aid he, and the &s;ooner, the better. She fell a crying. I find, &s;ays he, this Girl has made a Party of the whole Hou&s;e in her Favour again&s;t me. Her Innocence de&s;erves it of us all, &s;aid &s;he very kindly: And I never could have thought, that the Son of my dear good Lady departed,
<PB N="78" REF="115">
could have &s;o forfeited his Honour, as to endeavour to de&s;troy a Virtue he ought to protect. No more of this, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he; I will not bear it. As for <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;he has a lucky Knack at falling into Fits, when &s;he plea&s;es. But the cur&s;ed Yellings of you both made me not my&s;elf. I intended no Harm to her, as I told you both, if you'd have left your Squallings; and I did no Harm neither, but to my&s;elf; for I rai&s;ed a Hornet's Ne&s;t about my Ears, that, as far as I know, may have &s;tung to Death my Reputation. Sir, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> then I beg Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> may take my Accounts, and I will go away as &s;oon as I can. As for <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;he is at her Liberty, I hope, to go away next <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> as &s;he intends?</P>
<P>I &s;at &s;till; for I could not &s;peak, nor look up, and his Pre&s;ence di&s;compo&s;ed me extremely; but I was &s;orry to hear my&s;elf the unhappy Occa&s;ion of Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s lo&s;ing her Place, and hope that may be &s;till made up.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, let Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> make up your Ac|counts, as &s;oon as you will; and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> (who is his Hou&s;e-keeper in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI>) &s;hall come hither in your Place, and won't be le&s;s obliging, I dare &s;ay, than <HI>you</HI> have been. Said &s;he, I have never di&s;oblig'd you till now; and let me tell you, Sir, if you knew what belong'd to your own Reputation or Honour &mdash; No more, no more, &s;aid he, of the&s;e antiquated To|picks. I have been no bad Friend to you; and I &s;hall always e&s;teem you, tho' you have not been &s;o faithful to my Secrets, as I could have wi&s;h'd, and have laid me open to this Girl, which has made her more afraid of me than &s;he had Occa&s;ion. Well, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, after what pa&s;&s;ed Ye&s;terday, and la&s;t Night, I think I went rather too far in Favour of your Injunctions than other|wi&s;e; and I &s;hould have de&s;erv'd every body's Cen&s;ure, as the ba&s;e&s;t of Creatures, had I been capable of contri|buting to your lawle&s;s Attempts. Still, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="116">
&s;till reflecting upon me, and all for imaginary Faults! for what Harm have I done the Girl? &mdash; I won't bear it, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. But yet, in Re&s;pect to my Mother, I am willing to part friendly with you: Tho' you ought both of you to reflect on the Freedom of your Con|ver&s;ation, in relation to me; which I &s;hould have re&s;ented more than I do, but that I am con&s;cious I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to demean my&s;elf &s;o as to be in your Clo|&s;et, where I might have expected to hear a Multitude of impertinence between you.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you have no Objection, I hope, to <HI>Pamela</HI>'s going away on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next? You are mighty &s;olicitous, &s;aid he, about <HI>Pamela:</HI> But, no, not I; let her go as &s;oon as &s;he will: She is a naughty Girl, and has brought all this upon her&s;elf; and upon me more Trouble than &s;he can have had from me: But I have overcome it all, and will never concern my&s;elf about her.</P>
<P>I have a Propo&s;al made me, added he, &s;ince I have been out this Morning, that I &s;hall go near to embrace; and &s;o wi&s;h only, that a di&s;creet U&s;e may be made of what is pa&s;t; and there's an End of every thing with me, as to <HI>Pamela,</HI> I'll a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I cla&s;p'd my Hands together thro' my Apron, over|joy'd at this, tho' I was &s;oon to go away: For, naughty as he has been to me, I wi&s;h his Pro&s;perity with all my Heart, for my good old Lady's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, you need not now be afraid to &s;peak to me; tell me what you lifted up your Hands at? I &s;aid not a Word. Says he, If you like what I have &s;aid, give me your Hand upon it. I held my Hand upon my Apron; for I could not &s;peak to him; and he took hold of it, and pre&s;&s;ed it, tho' le&s;s hard than he did my Arm the Day be|fore. What does the little Fool cover her Face for? &s;aid he: Pull your Apron away; and let me &s;ee how
<PB N="80" REF="117">
you look, after your Freedom of Speech of me la&s;t Night. No wonder you're a&s;hamed to &s;ee me. You know you were very free with my Character.</P>
<P>I could not &s;tand this harbarous In&s;ult, at I took it to be, con&s;idering his Behaviour to me; and I then &s;poke and &s;aid, O the Difference between the Minds of thy Creatures, good God! How &s;hall &s;ome be ca&s;t down in their Innocence, while others &s;hall tri|umph in their Guilt!</P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, I went up Stairs to my Chamber, and wrote all this; for tho' he vex'd me at his Taunt|ing, yet I was plea&s;ed to hear he was likely to be mar|ry'd, and that his wicked Intentions were &s;o happily overcome as to me; and this made me a little ea&s;ier. And I hope I have pa&s;s'd the Wor&s;t; or el&s;e it is very hard. And yet I &s;han't think my&s;elf at Ea&s;e quite, till I am with you. For, methinks, after all, his Re|pentance and Amendment are mighty &s;uddenly re|&s;olv'd upon. But the Divine Grace is not confin'd to Space; and Remor&s;e may, and I hope has &s;mitten him to the Heart at once, for his Injuries to poor me! Yet I won't be too &s;ecure neither.</P>
<P>Having Opportunity, I &s;end now what I know will grieve you to the Heart. But I hope I &s;hall bring my next Scribble my&s;elf; and &s;o conclude, tho' half broken-hearted,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad I de&s;ir'd you not to meet me, and <HI>John</HI> &s;ays you won't; for he &s;ays, he told you, he is &s;ure I &s;hall get a Pa&s;&s;age well enough, either behind &s;ome one of my Fellow-&s;ervants on Hor&s;eback, or by Farmer <HI>Nichols</HI>'s Means: But as for the Chariot he talk'd to you of, I can't expect that Favour, to be &s;ure; and I &s;hould not care for it, becau&s;e it would look &s;o much above me. But Farmer <HI>Brady,</HI> they &s;ay, has a Chai&s;e with one Hor&s;e, and we hope to borrow that, or hire it rather than fail; tho' Money runs a little lowi&s;h, after what I have laid out; but I don't care to &s;ay &s;o here: tho' I warrant I might have what I would of Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>; but then how &s;hall I pay it, you'll &s;ay? And be&s;ides, I don't love to be beholden.</P>
<P>But the chief Rea&s;on I'm glad you don't &s;et out to meet me, is the Uncertainty; for it &s;eems I mu&s;t &s;tay another Week &s;till, and hope certainly to go <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> after. For poor Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> will go at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;ays, and can't be ready before.</P>
<P>Oh! that I was once well with you!&mdash;Tho' he is very civil too at pre&s;ent, and not &s;o cro&s;s as he was; and yet he is as vexatious another way, as you &s;hall hear. For Ye&s;terday he had a rich Suit of Cloaths brought home, which they call a Birth-day Suit; for he intends to go to <HI>London</HI> again&s;t next Birth-day, to &s;ee the Court, and our Folks will have it he is to be made a Lord. &mdash; I wi&s;h they may make him an hone&s;t Man, as he was always thought; but I have not found it &s;o, Alas for me!</P>
<P>And &s;o, as I was &s;aying, he had the&s;e Cloaths come home, and he try'd them on. And before he
<PB N="82" REF="119">
pull'd them off, he &s;ent for me, when nobody el&s;e was in the Parlour with him: <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, you are &s;o neat and &s;o nice in your own Dre&s;s, (AlacK-a-day, I did'n't know I was!) that you mu&s;t be a Judge of ours. How are the&s;e Cloaths made? Do they fit me?&mdash; I am no Judge, &s;aid I, and plea&s;e your Honour; but I think they look very fine.</P>
<P>His Wai&s;tcoat &s;tood an End with Gold Lace, and he look'd very grand. But what he did la&s;t, has made me very &s;erious, and I could make him no Compli|ments. Said he, Why don't you wear your u&s;ual Cloaths? Tho' I think every thing looks well upon you (For I &s;till continue in my new Dre&s;s). I &s;aid, I have no Cloaths, Sir, I ought to call my own, but the&s;e: And it is no Matter what &s;uch a one as I wears. Said he, Why, you look very &s;erious, <HI>Pa|mela.</HI> I &s;ee you can bear Malice.&mdash;Yes, &s;o I can, Sir, &s;aid I, according to the Occa&s;ion! Why, &s;aid he, your Eyes always look red, I think. Are you not a Fool to take my la&s;t Freedom &s;o much at Heart? I am &s;ure, you, and that Fool Mrs <HI>Jervis,</HI> frightened me, by your hideous Squalling, as much as I could frighten you. That is all we had for it, &s;aid I; and if you could be &s;o afraid of your own Servants know|ing of your Attempts upon a poor unworthy Creature, that is under your Protection while I &s;tay, &s;urely your Honour ought to be more afraid of God Almighty, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence we all &s;tand, in every Action of our Lives, and to whom the Greate&s;t, as well as the Lea&s;t, mu&s;t be accountable, let them think what they li&s;t.</P>
<P>He took my Hand, in a kind of good-humour'd Mockery, and &s;aid, Well &s;aid, my pretty Preacher I When my <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> Chaplain dies, I'll put thee on a Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock, and thou'lt make a good Figure in his Place!&mdash; I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, a little vex'd at his Jeer, your Honour's Con&s;cience would be your Preacher,
<PB N="83" REF="120">
and then you would need no other Chaplain. Well, well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, no more of this unfa&s;hionable Jargon. I did not &s;end for you &s;o much for your Opinion of my new Suit, as to tell you, you are wel|come to &s;tay, &s;ince Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> de&s;ires it, till &s;he goes. I welcome! &s;aid I; I am &s;ure I &s;hall rejoice when I am out of the Hou&s;e!</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, you are an ungrateful Baggage; but I am thinking it would be Pity, with the&s;e fair &s;oft Hands, and that lovely Skin, (as he called it, and took hold of my Hand) that you &s;hould return again to hard Work, as you mu&s;t, if you go to your Father's; and &s;o I would advi&s;e her to take a Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> and let Lodgings to us Members of Parliament, when we come to Town; and &s;uch a pretty <HI>Daughter</HI> as you may pa&s;s for, will always fill her Hou&s;e, and &s;he'll get a great deal of Money.</P>
<P>I was &s;adly vex'd at this barbarous Joke; but was ready to cry before, and I gu&s;h'd out into Tears, and (endeavouring to get my Hand from him, but in vain) &s;aid, I can expect no better from &s;uch a rude Gentle|man: Your Behaviour, Sir, to me has been ju&s;t of a Piece with the&s;e Words; nay, I will &s;ay't, tho' you were to be ever &s;o angry.&mdash;I angry, <HI>Pamela!</HI> No, no, &s;aid he, I have overcome all that; and as you are to go away, I look upon you now as Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Gue&s;t, while you both &s;tay, and not as my Servant; and &s;o you may &s;ay what you will. But I'll tell you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> why you need not take this Matter in &s;uch high Di&s;dain I&mdash;You have a very pretty romantick Turn for Virtue, and all that. &mdash;And I don't &s;uppo&s;e but you'll hold it &s;till; and no|body will be able to prevail upon you. But, my Child, (fleeringly he &s;poke it) do but con&s;ider what a fine Op|portunity you will then have, for a Tale every Day to good Mother <HI>Jervis,</HI> and what Subjects for Letter-writing to your Father and Mother, and what pretty Preachments you may hold forth to the young Gentle|men.

Ad's my Hear.! I think it would be the be&s;t Thing you and &s;he could do.</P>
<P>You do well, Sir, &s;aid I, to even your Wit to &s;uch a poor Maiden as me. But, Sir, let me &s;ay, that if you was not rich and great, and I poor and little, you would not in&s;ult me thus.&mdash; Let me ask you, Sir, if you think this becomes your fine Cloaths, and a Ma&s;ter's Station? Why &s;o &s;erious, my pretty <HI>Pamela?</HI> &s;aid he; Why &s;o grave? And would ki&s;s me; but my Heart was full, and I &s;aid, Let me alone! I <HI>will</HI> tell you, if you was a King, and &s;aid to me what you have done, that you are no Gentleman: And I won't &s;tay to be u&s;ed thus! I will go to the next Far|mer's, and there wait for Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> if &s;he mu&s;t go: And I'd have you know, Sir, that I can &s;toop to the ordinarie&s;t Work of your Scullions, for all the&s;e na&s;ty &s;oft Hands, &s;ooner than bear &s;uch ungentlemanly Im|putations.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, I &s;ent for you in, in high good Hu|mour; but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to hold it with &s;uch an Im|pertinent: However I'll keep my Temper. But while I &s;ee you here, pray don't put on tho&s;e di&s;mal grave Looks; Why, Girl, you &s;hould forbear 'em, if it were but for your Pride-&s;ake; for the Family will think you are grieving to leave the Hou&s;e. Then, Sir, &s;aid I, I will try to convince them of the contrary, as well as your Honour; for I will endeavour to be more chearful while I &s;tay, for that very Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, I will &s;et this down by it&s;elf, as the fir&s;t Time that ever what I advis'd had any Weight with you. And I will &s;ay, &s;aid I, as the fir&s;t Advice you have given me of late, that was fit to be follow'd! &mdash; I wi&s;h, &s;aid he, (I'm almo&s;t a&s;ham'd to write it, impudent Gentleman as he is! I wi&s;h) I had thee as <HI>quick another Way,</HI> as thou art in thy Repartees&mdash; And he laugh'd, and I &s;natch'd my Hand from him,

<P><HI>JOHN</HI> &s;ays you wept when you read my la&s;t Letter, that he carry'd. I am &s;orry you let him &s;ee that; for they all mi&s;tru&s;t already how Matters are; and as it is no Credit that I have been <HI>attempted,</HI> tho' it is that I have <HI>re&s;i&s;ted</HI>; yet I am &s;orry they have Cau&s;e to think &s;o evil of my Ma&s;ter from any of us:</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> has made up her Accounts with Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and will &s;tay in her Place. I am glad of it, for her own &s;ake, and for my Ma&s;ter's; for &s;he has a good Ma&s;ter of him; &s;o indeed all have, but poor me! &mdash; and he has a good Hou&s;ekeeper in her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> it &s;eems, took upon him to talk to my Ma&s;ter, how faithful and careful of his Intere&s;ts &s;he was, and how exact in her Accounts; and he told him, there was no Compari&s;on between her Ac|counts and Mrs. <HI>Jewkers</HI>'s, at the <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> E&s;tate.
<PB N="87" REF="124">
He &s;aid &s;o many fine Things, it &s;eems, of Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that my Ma&s;ter &s;ent for her in Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>'s Pre|&s;ence, and &s;aid <HI>Pamela</HI> might come along with her: I &s;uppo&s;e to mortify me, that I mu&s;t go, while &s;he was to &s;tay: But as, when I go away, I am not to go with her, nor was &s;he to go with me; &s;o I did not matter it much; only it would have been creditable to &s;uch a poor Girl, that the Hou&s;ekeeper would bear me Com|pany, if I went.</P>
<P>Said he to her, Well, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> &s;ays you have made up your Accounts with him, with your u&s;ual Fidelity and Exactne&s;s. I had a good mind to make you an Offer of continuing with me, if you can be a little &s;orry for your ha&s;ty Words, which indeed were not &s;o re&s;pectful as I have de&s;erv'd at your Hands. She &s;eemed at a &s;ad Lo&s;s what to &s;ay, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> was there; and &s;he could not &s;peak of the Occa&s;ion of tho&s;e Words, which was <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> I mu&s;t needs &s;ay before your Face, that &s;ince I have known my Ma&s;ter's Fa|mily, I have never found &s;uch good Management in it, nor &s;o much Love and Harmony neither. I wi&s;h the <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> E&s;tate was as well &s;erv'd! &mdash; No more of that, &s;aid my Ma&s;ter; but Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> may &s;tay, if &s;he will; and here, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> pray accept of this, which at the Clo&s;e of every Year's Accounts I will pre|&s;ent you with, be&s;ides your Salary, as long as I find your Care &s;o u&s;eful and agreeable. And he gave her five Guineas.&mdash; She made him a low Curt'&s;y, and thanking him, look'd to me, as if &s;he would have &s;poken to me.</P>
<P>He took her Meaning, I believe; for he &s;aid,&mdash; Indeed I love to encourage Merit and Obligingne&s;s, Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>; but I can never be equally kind to tho&s;e who don't de&s;erve it at my Hands, as to tho&s;e who
<PB N="88" REF="125">
do; and then he look'd full at me. Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> continued he, I &s;aid that Girl might come in with Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> becau&s;e they love to be always together. For Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> is very good to her, and loves her as well as if &s;he was her Daughter. But el&s;e&mdash; Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> interrupting him, &s;aid, <HI>Good</HI> to Mrs. <HI>Pamela!</HI> Ay, Sir, and &s;o &s;he is, to be &s;ure! But every body mu&s;t be good to her; for&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going on. But my Ma&s;ter &s;aid, No more, no more, Mr. <HI>Longman.</HI> I &s;ee old Men are taken with pretty young Girls, as well as other Folks; and fair Looks hide many a Fault, where a Per&s;on has the Art to behave obligingly. Why, and plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> every body&mdash;and was going on, I believe to &s;ay &s;omething more in my Prai&s;e; but he interrupted him, and &s;aid, Not a Word more of this <HI>Pamela.</HI> I can't let her &s;tay, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; not only for her own Freedom of Speech, but her Letter-writing of all the Secrets of my Family. Ay! &s;aid the good old Man; I'm &s;orry for that too! But, Sir&mdash;No more, I &s;ay, &s;aid my Ma&s;ter; for my Reputation's &s;o well known, (mighty fine, thought I!) that I care not what any body writes or &s;ays of <HI>me:</HI> But to tell you the Truth, (not that it need go further, I think of changing my Condition &s;oon; and, you know, young Ladies of Birth and Fortune will chu&s;e their own Ser|vants, and that's my chief Rea&s;on why <HI>Pamela</HI> can't &s;tay. As for the re&s;t, &s;aid he, the Girl is a good &s;ort of Body, take her all together; tho' I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, a little pert, &s;ince my Mother's Death, in her An&s;wers, and gives me two Words for one; which I can't bear; nor is there Rea&s;on I &s;hould, you know, Mr. <HI>Long|man.</HI> No, to be &s;ure, Sir, &s;aid he; but 'tis &s;trange methinks, &s;he &s;hould be &s;o mild and meek to every one of us in the Hou&s;e, and forget her&s;elf &s;o where &s;he &s;hould &s;hew mo&s;t Re&s;pect! Very true, Mr. <HI>Long|man,</HI> &s;aid he; but &s;o it is, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; and it was
<PB N="89" REF="126">
from her Pertne&s;s, that Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and I had the Words: And I &s;hould mind it the le&s;s, but that the Girl (there &s;he &s;tands, I &s;ay it to her Face) has Wit and Sen&s;e above her Years, and knows better.</P>
<P>I was in great Pain to &s;ay &s;omething, but yet I knew not what, before Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> look'd at me, and walk'd to the Window to hide her Concern for me. At la&s;t, I &s;aid, It is for <HI>you,</HI> Sir, to &s;ay what you plea&s;e; and for <HI>me</HI> only to &s;ay, God ble&s;s your Honour!</P>
<P>Poor Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> falter'd in his Speech, and was ready to cry. Said my in&s;ulting Ma&s;ter to me, Why pr'ythee, <HI>Pamela,</HI> now, &s;hew thy&s;elf as thou art, be|fore Mr. <HI>Longman.</HI> Can'&s;t not give him a Specimen of that Pertne&s;s which thou ha&s;t exercis'd upon me &s;ometimes?</P>
<P>Did he not, my dear Father and Mother, de&s;erve all the Truth to be told? Yet I overcame my&s;elf &s;o far, as to &s;ay, Well, your Honour may play upon a poor Girl, that you <HI>can</HI> an&s;wer you, but <HI>dare</HI> not.</P>
<P>Why, pr'ythee now, In&s;inuator, &s;aid he, &s;ay the wor&s;t you can before Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> I challenge the utmo&s;t of thy Impertinence; and as you are going away, and have the Love of every body, I would be a little ju&s;tify'd to my Family, that you have no Rea&s;on to complain of Hard&s;hips from me, as I have of pert &s;aucy An&s;wers from you, be&s;ides ex|po&s;ing me by your Letters.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, &s;aid I, I am of no Con&s;equence equal to this, in your Honour's Family, that &s;uch a great Gentleman as you, my Ma&s;ter, &s;hould need to ju&s;tify your&s;elf about me. I am glad Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;tays with your Honour; and I know I have <HI>not de&s;erv'd</HI> to &s;tay; and more than that, I don't <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Ads-bobbers! &s;aid Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and ran to me; don't &s;ay &s;o, don't &s;ay &s;o, dear Mrs. <HI>Pamela!</HI> We all love you dearly; and pray down of your Knees, and
<PB N="90" REF="127">
ask his Honour Pardon, and we will all become Plead|ers in a Body, and I, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> too, at the Head of it, to beg his Honour's Pardon, and to continue you, at lea&s;t till his Honour marries.&mdash; No, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, I cannot ask; nor will I &s;tay, if I might. All I de&s;ire, is, to return to my poor Father and Mother; and tho' I love you all, I won't &s;tay.&mdash; O well-a-day, well-a-day! &s;aid the good old Man, I did not expect this?&mdash;When I had got Matters thus far, and had made all up for Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I was in Hopes to have got a double Holiday of Joy for all the Family, in your Pardon too. Well, &s;aid my Ma|&s;ter, this is a little Specimen of what I told you, Mr. <HI>Longman.</HI> You &s;ee there's a Spirit you did not expect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jervis</HI> told me after, that &s;he could &s;tay no longer, to hear me &s;o hardly u&s;ed, and mu&s;t have &s;poken, had &s;he &s;tay'd, what would never have been forgiven her; &s;o &s;he went out. I look'd after her to go too; but my Ma&s;ter &s;aid, Come, <HI>Pamela,</HI> give another Specimen, I de&s;ire you, to Mr. <HI>Long|man:</HI> I am &s;ure you mu&s;t, if you will but <HI>&s;peak.</HI> Well, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;ince it &s;eems your Greatne&s;s wants to be ju&s;tified by my Lowne&s;s, and I have no De&s;ire you &s;hould &s;uffer in the Sight of your Family, I will &s;ay, on my bended Knees, (and &s;o I kneeled down) that I have been a very faulty, and a very ingrateful Creature to the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of Ma&s;ters: I have been very perver&s;e and &s;aucy; and have de&s;erv'd nothing at your Hands, but to be turn'd out of your Family with Shame and Di&s;grace. I, therefore, have nothing to &s;ay for my&s;elf, but that I am not <HI>worthy</HI> to &s;tay, and &s;o cannot wi&s;h to &s;tay, and <HI>will</HI> not &s;tay: And &s;o God Almighty ble&s;s you, and you, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and good Mrs <HI>Jervis,</HI> and every living Soul of the Family! and I will pray for you as long as I live.&mdash; And &s;o I ro&s;e up, and was
<PB N="91" REF="128">
forc'd to lean upon my Ma&s;ter's Elbow-chair, or I &s;hould have &s;unk down.</P>
<P>The poor old Man wept more than I, and &s;aid, Ads-bobbers, was ever the like heard! 'Tis too much, too much; I can't bear it. As I hope to live, I am quite melted. Dear Sir, forgive her: The poor Thing prays for you; &s;he prays for us all! She owns her Fault; yet <HI>won't</HI> be forgiven! I profe&s;s I know not what to make of it.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, harden'd Wretch as he was, &s;eem'd a little mov'd, and took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and walk'd to the Window: What Sort of a Day is it? &s;aid he.&mdash; And then getting a little more Hard-heartedne&s;s, he &s;aid, Well, you may be gone from my Pre&s;ence, thou &s;trange Med|ley of Incon&s;i&s;tence! but you &s;han't &s;tay after your Time in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Nay, pray, Sir, pray, Sir, &s;aid the good old Man, relent a little. Ads-heartlikins! you young Gentle|men are made of Iron and Steel, I think: I'm &s;ure, &s;aid he, my Heart's turn'd into Butter, and is running away at my Eyes. I never felt the like before.&mdash; Said my Ma&s;ter, with an imperious Tone, Get out of my Pre&s;ence, Hu&s;&s;y; I can't bear you in my Sight. Sir, &s;aid I, I'm going as fa&s;t as I can.</P>
<P>But indeed, my dear Father and Mother, my Head was &s;o giddy, and my Limbs trembled &s;o, that I was forc'd to go holding by the Wain&s;cot all the way with both my Hands, and thought I &s;hould not have got to the Door: But when I did, as I hop'd this would be my la&s;t Interview with this terrible hard-hearted Ma&s;ter, I turn'd about, and made a low Curt'&s;y, and &s;aid, God ble&s;s you, Sir! God ble&s;s <HI>you,</HI> Mr. <HI>Longman!</HI> And I went into the Lobby leading to the great Hall, and dropt into the fir&s;t Chair; for I could get no further a good while.</P>

<P>I Mu&s;t write on, tho' I &s;hall come &s;o &s;oon; for now I have hardly any thing el&s;e to do. For I have fini&s;h'd all that lay upon me to do, and only wait the good Time of &s;etting out. Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid, I mu&s;t be low in Pocket, for what I had laid out; and &s;o would have pre&s;ented me with two Guineas of her Five; but I could not take them of her, becau&s;e, poor Gentlewoman, &s;he pays old Debts for her Chil|dren that were extravagant, and wants them her&s;elf. This, tho', was very good in her.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, I &s;hall have but little to bring with me; but I know you won't, you are &s;o good!&mdash; and I will work the harder, when I come home, if I can get a little Plain-work, or any thing to do. But all your Neighbourhood is &s;o poor, that I fear I &s;hall want Work; but may-be Dame <HI>Mumford</HI> can help me to &s;omething, from &s;ome good Family &s;he is acquainted with.</P>
<P>Here, what a &s;ad Thing it is! I have been brought up wrong, as Matters &s;tand. For, you know, my good Lady, now in Heav'n, lov'd Singing and Dancing;
<PB N="93" REF="130">
and, as &s;he would have it I had a Voice, &s;he made me learn both; and often and often has &s;he made me &s;ing her an innocent Song, and a good P&s;alm too, and dance before her. And I mu&s;t learn to flower and draw too, and to work fine Work with my Needle; why, all this too I have got pretty to|lerably at my Fingers End, as they &s;ay; and &s;he us'd to prai&s;e me, and was a good Judge of &s;uch Mat|ters.</P>
<P>Well now, what is all this to the Purpo&s;e, as Things have turn'd about?</P>
<P>Why, no more nor le&s;s, than that I am like the Gra&s;hopper in the Fable, which I have read of in my Lady's Books: and I will write it down, in the very Words:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the Ants were airing their Provi&s;ions one Winter, a hungry Gra&s;hopper (as &s;uppo&s;e it was poor I) begg'd a Charity of them. They told him, That he &s;hould have wrought in Summer, if he would not have wanted in Winter. Well, &s;ays the Gra&s;hopper, but I was not idle neither; for I &s;ung out the whole Sea&s;on. Nay, then, &s;aid they, you'll e'en do well to make a merry Year of it, and dance in Winter to the Tune you &s;ung in Summer."</Q></P>
<P>So I &s;hall make a fine Figure with my Singing and my Dancing, when I come home to you! Nay, I doubt, I &s;hall even be unfit for a <HI>May-day</HI> Holiday-time; for the&s;e Minuits, Rigadoons, and <HI>French</HI> Dances, that I have been practi&s;ing, will make me but ill Company for my rural Milk-maid Companions that are to be. To be &s;ure I had better, as Things &s;tand, have learn'd to wa&s;h and &s;cour, and brew and bake, and &s;uch-like. But I hope, if I can't get Work, and can get a Place, to learn the&s;e &s;oon, if any body will
<PB N="94" REF="131">
have the Goodne&s;s to bear with me, till I can learn. For, I ble&s;s God, I have an humble and a teachable Mind, for all what my Ma&s;ter &s;ays; and, next to his Grace, that is all my Comfort: For I &s;hall think nothing too mean that is hone&s;t. It may be a little hard at fir&s;t, but wo to my proud Heart, if I &s;hall find it &s;o, on Trial! for I will make it bend to its Condition, or will break it.</P>
<P>I have read of a good Bi&s;hop that was to be burnt for his Religion; and he try'd how he could bear it, by putting his Fingers into the lighted Candle: So I, t'other Day, try'd, when <HI>Rachel</HI>'s Back was turn'd, if I could not &s;cour the Pewter Plate &s;he had begun. I &s;ee I could do't by Degrees; tho' I bli&s;ter'd my Hand in two Places.</P>
<P>All the Matter is, if I could get Needle-work enough, I would not &s;poil my Fingers by this rough Work. But if I can't, I hope to make my Hands as red as a Blood-pudden, and as hard as a Beechen Trencher, to accommodate them to my Condition.&mdash; But I mu&s;t break off, here's &s;omebody coming.</P>
<P>'Tis only our <HI>Hannah</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age from Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI>&mdash; But, hold, here is &s;omebody el&s;e.&mdash; Well, it is only <HI>Rachel.</HI></P>
<P>I am as much frighted as were the City Mou&s;e and the Country Mou&s;e, in the &s;ame Book of Fables, at every thing that &s;tirs. Oh! I have a Power of the&s;e Things to entertain you with in Winter Evenings, when I come home. If I can but get Work, with a little Time for Reading, I hope we &s;hall be very hap|py, over our Peat Fires.</P>
<P>What made me hint to you, that I &s;hould bring but little with me, is this:</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, I did intend to do, as I have this Afternoon: And that is, I took all my Cloaths,
<PB N="95" REF="132">
and all my Linen, and I divided them into three Par|cels, as I had before told Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> I intended to do; and I &s;aid, It is now <HI>Monday,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and I am to go away on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning betimes; &s;o, tho' I know you don't doubt my Hone&s;ty, I beg you will look over my poor Matters, and let every one have what belongs to them; for, &s;aid I, you know I am re&s;olv'd to take with me only what I can properly call my own.</P>
<P>Said &s;he, (I did not know her Drift then; to be &s;ure &s;he meant well; but I did not thank her for it, when I did know it) Let your Things be brought down into the Green-room, and I will do any thing you would have me do.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, &s;aid I, Green-room or any|where; but I think you might &s;tep up, and &s;ee 'em as they lie.</P>
<P>However, I fetch'd 'em down, and laid them in three Parcels, as before; and, when I had done, I went down to call her up to look at them.</P>
<P>Now, it &s;eems, &s;he had prepared my Ma&s;ter for this Scene, unknown to me; and in this Green-room was a Clo&s;et, with a Sa&s;h-door and a Curtain before it; for there &s;he puts her Sweet-meats and &s;uch Things; and &s;he did it, it &s;eems, to turn his Heart, as know|ing what I intended, I &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;hould make me take the Things; for if he had, I &s;hould have made Money of them, to help us when we got together; for, to be &s;ure, I could never have appear'd in them.</P>
<P>Well, as I was &s;aying, he had got, unknown to me, in this Clo&s;et; I &s;uppo&s;e while I went to call Mrs. <HI>Jervis:</HI> And &s;he &s;ince told me, it was at his De&s;ire, when &s;he told him &s;omething of what I intended, or el&s;e &s;he would not have done it: Tho' I have Rea&s;on, I'm &s;ure, to remember the la&s;t Clo&s;et-work.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="133">So I &s;aid, when &s;he came up, Here, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> is the fir&s;t Parcel; I will &s;pread it all abroad. The&s;e are the Things my good Lady gave me.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, &s;aid I&mdash;and &s;o I went on de&s;cribing the Cloaths and Linen my Lady had given me, mingling Ble&s;&s;ings, as I proceeded, for her Goodne&s;s to me; and when I had turn'd over that Parcel, I &s;aid, Well, &s;o much for the fir&s;t Parcel, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; that was my Lady's Gifts.</P>
<P>Now I come to the Pre&s;ents of my dear virtuous Ma&s;ter: Hay, you know, <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> for that! Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis.</HI> She laugh'd, and &s;aid, I never &s;aw &s;uch a comi|cal Girl in my Life. But go on. I will, Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis,</HI> &s;aid I, as &s;oon as I have open'd the Bundle; for I was as brisk and as pert as could be, little thinking who heard me.</P>
<P>Now here, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, are my ever worthy Ma&s;ter's Pre&s;ents; and then I particulariz'd all tho&s;e in the &s;econd Bundle.</P>
<P>After which, I turn'd to my own, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>Now, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> comes poor <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Bundle, and a little one it is, to the others. Fir&s;t, here is a Calico Night-gown, that I u&s;ed to wear o' Morn|ings. 'Twill be rather too good for me when I get home; but I mu&s;t have &s;omething. Then there is a quilted Calimanco Coat, and a Pair of Stockens I bought of the Pedlar, and my Straw-hat with blue Strings; and a Remnant of <HI>Scots</HI> Cloth, which will make two Shirts and two Shifts, the &s;ame I have on, for my poor Father and Mother. And here are four other Shifts, one the Fellow to that I have on; ano|ther pretty good one, and the other two old fine ones, that will &s;erve me to turn and wind with at home, for they are not worth leaving behind me; and here are two Pair of Shoes; I have taken the Lace off, which I will burn, and may-be will fetch me
<PB N="97" REF="134">
&s;ome little Matter at a Pinch, with an old &s;ilver Buckle or two.</P>
<P>What do you laugh for, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> &s;aid I. &mdash; Why you are like an <HI>April</HI> Day; you cry and laugh in a Breath.</P>
<P>Well, let me &s;een; ay, here is a Cotton Handker|chief I bought of the Pedlar; there &s;hould be an|other &s;omewhere. O here it is! And here too are my new-bought knit Mittens. And this is my new Flannel Coat, the Fellow to that I have on And in this Parcel pinn'd together, are &s;everal Pieces of printed Calico, Remnants of Silks, and &s;uch-like, that, if good Luck &s;hould happen, and I &s;hould get Work, would &s;erve for Robings and Facings, and &s;uch-like U&s;es. And here too are a Pair of Pockets; they are too fine for me; but I have no wor&s;e. Ble&s;s me! &s;aid I, I did not think I had &s;o many good Things!</P>
<P>Well, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, you have &s;een all my Store, and I will now &s;it down, and tell you a Piece of my Mind.</P>
<P>Be brief then, &s;aid &s;he, my good Girl; for &s;he was afraid, &s;he &s;aid afterwards, that I &s;hould &s;ay too much.</P>
<P>Why then the Ca&s;e is this: I am to enter upon a Point of Equity and Con&s;cience, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; and I mu&s;t beg, if you love me, you'd let me have my own Way. Tho&s;e Things there of my Lady's, I can have no Claim to, &s;o as to take them away; for &s;he gave them me, &s;uppo&s;ing I was to wear them in her Service, and to do Credit to her bountiful Heart. But &s;ince I am to be turn'd away, you know, I can|not wear them at my poor Father's; for I &s;hould bring all the little Village upon my Back: and &s;o I re&s;olve not to have <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="135">Then, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, I have far le&s;s Right to the&s;e of my worthy Ma&s;ter's. For you &s;ee what was his Intention in giving them to me. So they were to be the Price of my Shame, and if I <HI>could</HI> make u&s;e of them, I &s;hould think I &s;hould never pro&s;per with them; and be&s;ides, you know, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> if I would not do the good Gentleman's Work, why &s;hould I take his Wages? So in Con&s;cience, in Honour, in every thing, I have nothing to &s;ay to thee, thou <HI>&s;econd wicked</HI> Bundle!</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, come to my Arms, my dear <HI>third</HI> Par|cel, the Companion of my Poverty, and the Witne&s;s of my Hone&s;ty; and may I never de&s;erve the lea&s;t Rag that is contain'd in thee, when I forfeit a Title to that Innocence that I hope will ever be the Pride of my Life! and then I am &s;ure it will be my highe&s;t Comfort at my Death, when all the Riches and Pomps of the World will be wor&s;e than the vile&s;t Rags that can be worn by Beggars! And &s;o I hugg'd my <HI>third</HI> Bundle.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> (and &s;he wept to hear me) one thing more I have to trouble you with, and that's all.</P>
<P>There are Four Guineas, you know, that came out of my good Lady's Pocket, when &s;he dy'd, that, with &s;ome Silver, my Ma&s;ter gave me: Now the&s;e &s;ame Four Guineas I &s;ent to my poor Father and Mother, and they have broken them; but would make them up, if I would: And if you think it &s;hould be &s;o, it &s;hall. But pray tell me hone&s;tly your Mind: As to the Three Years before my Lady's Death, do you think, as I had no Wages, I may be &s;uppos'd to be Quits? &mdash; By Quits, I cannot mean, that my poor Services &s;hould be equal to my Lady's Goodne&s;s; for that's impo&s;&s;ible. But as all her Learning and Education of me, as Matters have turn'd, will be of little Service to me now; for it had been better
<PB N="99" REF="136">
for me to have been brought up to hard Labour to be &s;ure; for that I mu&s;t turn to at la&s;t, if I can't get a Place (and you know, in Places too, one is &s;ubject to &s;uch Temptations as are dreadful to think of): So I &s;ay, by Quits, I only mean, as I return all the good Things &s;he gave me, whether I may not &s;et my little Services again&s;t my Keeping; becau&s;e, as I &s;aid, my Learning is not now in the Que&s;tion; and I am &s;ure my dear good Lady would have thought &s;o, had &s;he liv'd: But that, too, is now out of the Que&s;tion. Well then, if &s;o, I would ask, whether in above this Year that I have liv'd with my Ma&s;ter, as I am re|&s;olved to leave all his Gifts behind me, I may not have earn'd, be&s;ides my Keeping, the&s;e Four Guineas, and the&s;e poor Cloaths here upon my Back, and in my third Bundle? Now tell me your Mind freely without Favour or Affection.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Maiden, &s;aid &s;he, you make me unable to &s;peak to you at all: To be &s;ure, it will be the highe&s;t Affront that can be offer'd, for you to leave any of the&s;e Things behind you; and you mu&s;t take all your Bundles with you, or my Ma&s;ter will never forgive you.</P>
<P>Well, well, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, I don't care; I have been too much u&s;ed to be &s;nubb'd and hardly treated by my Ma&s;ter, of late. I have done him no Harm; and I &s;hall always pray for him, and wi&s;h him happy. But I don't de&s;erve the&s;e Things, I know I don't. Then I can't wear them, if I &s;hould take them; &s;o they can be of no U&s;e to me: And I tru&s;t I &s;hall not want the poor Pittance, that is all I de&s;ire to keep Life and Soul together. Bread and Water I can live upon, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> with Content. Water I &s;hall get any-where; and if I can't get me Bread, I will live like a Bird in Winter upon Hips and Haws,
<PB N="100" REF="137">
and at other times upon Pig-nuts, and Potatoes, or Turneps, or any thing. So what Occa&s;ion have I for the&s;e Things?&mdash;But all I ask is about the&s;e Four Gui|neas, and if you think I need not return them, that is all I want to know.&mdash; To be &s;ure, my Dear, you need not, &s;aid &s;he; you have well earn'd them by that Wai&s;t|coat only. No, I think not <HI>&s;o,</HI> in that only; but in the Linen&punc; and other Things, do you think I have? Yes, yes, &s;aid &s;he, and more. And my Keeping allow'd for, I mean, &s;aid I, and the&s;e poor Cloaths on my Back, be&s;ides? Remember that, Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> Yes, my dear Odd-ones, no doubt you have! Well then, &s;aid I, I am as happy as a Prince&s;s. I am quite as rich as I wi&s;h to be! And, once more, my dear third Bundle, I will hug thee to my Bo&s;om. And I beg you'll &s;ay nothing of all this till I am gone, that my Ma&s;ter mayn't be &s;o angry, but that I may go in Peace; for my Heart, without other Matters, will be ready to break to part with you all.</P>
<P>Now, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, as to one Matter more: And that is my Ma&s;ter's la&s;t U&s;age of me, before Mr. <HI>Longman.</HI>&mdash;Said &s;he, Pr'ythee, dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;tep to my Chamber, and fetch me a Paper I left on my Ta|ble. I have &s;omething to &s;hew you in it. I will, &s;aid I, and &s;tept down but that was only a Fetch to take the Orders of my Ma&s;ter, I found. It &s;eems he &s;aid, he thought two or three times to have bur&s;t out upon me; but he could not &s;tand it, and wi&s;h'd I might not know he was there. But I tript up again &s;o nimbly, (for there was no Paper) that I ju&s;t &s;aw his Back, as if coming out of that Green Room, and going into the next to it, the fir&s;t Door that was open. &mdash;I whipt in, and &s;hut the Door and bolted it. O Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, what have you done by me? &mdash; I &s;ee I can't confide in any body. I am be&s;et on all Hands! Wretched, wretched <HI>Pamela!</HI> where &s;halt thou ex|pect

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Write again, tho', may-be, I &s;hall bring it to you in my Pocket my&s;elf. For I &s;hall have no Write|ing, nor Writing-time, I hope, when I come to you. This is <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, and I &s;hall, I hope, &s;et out to you To-morrow Morning; but I have had more Trials, and more Vexation; but of another Complexion too a little, though all from the &s;ame Quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="139">Ye&s;terday my Ma&s;ter, after he came from Hunt|ing, &s;ent for me. I went with great Terror; for I expected he would &s;torm, and be in a fine Pa&s;&s;ion with me for my Freedom of Speech before: So I was re&s;olv'd to begin fir&s;t, with Submi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;arm his Anger; and I fell upon my Knees as &s;oon as I &s;aw him; and I &s;aid, Good Sir, let me be&s;eech you, as you hope to be forgiven your&s;elf, and for the &s;ake of my dear good Lady your Mother, who recommended me to you with her la&s;t Words, to forgive me all my Faults: And only grant me this Favour, the la&s;t I have to ask you, that you will let me depart your Hou&s;e with Peace and Quietne&s;s of Mind, that I may take &s;uch a Leave of my dear Fellow-&s;ervants as befits me; and that my Heart be not quite broken.</P>
<P>He took me up, in a kinder manner, than ever I had known; and he &s;aid, Shut the Door, <HI>Pamela,</HI> and come to me in my Clo&s;et: I want to have a little &s;erious Talk with you. How can I, Sir, &s;aid I, how can I? and wrung my Hands! O pray, Sir, let me go out of your Pre&s;ence, I be&s;eech you. By the God that made me, &s;aid he, I'll do you no Harm. Shut the Parlour-door, and come to me in my Library.</P>
<P>He then went into his Clo&s;et, which is his Library, and full of rich Pictures be&s;ides; a noble Apartment, tho' called a Clo&s;et, and next the private Garden, into which it has a Door that opens. I &s;hut the Par|lour-door, as he bid me; but &s;tood at it irre&s;olute. Place &s;ome Confidence in me &s;urely, &s;aid he, you may, when I have &s;poken thus &s;olemnly. So I crept to|wards him with trembling Feet, and my Heart throb|bing through my Handkerchief. Come in, &s;aid he, when I bid you. I did &s;o. Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, pity and &s;pare me. I will, &s;aid he, as I hop'd to be &s;av'd. He &s;at down upon a rich Settee; and took
<PB N="103" REF="140">
hold of my Hand, and &s;aid, Don't doubt me, <HI>Pa|mela.</HI> From this Moment I will no more con&s;ider you as my Servant; and I de&s;ire you'll not u&s;e me with Ingratitude for the Kindne&s;s I am going to ex|pre&s;s towards you. This a little embolden'd me; and he &s;aid, holding both my Hands in his, You have too much Wit and good Sen&s;e not to di&s;cover, that I, in &s;pite of my Heart, and all the Pride of it, cannot but love you. Yes, look up to me, my &s;weet-fac'd Girl! I mu&s;t &s;ay I love you; and have put on a Beha|viour to you, that was much again&s;t my Heart, in hopes to frighten you to my Purpo&s;es. You &s;ee I own it ingenuou&s;ly; and don't play your Sex upon me for it.</P>
<P>I was unable to &s;peak, and he &s;eeing me too much oppre&s;s'd with Confu&s;ion to go on in that Strain, &s;aid, Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> let me know in what Situation of Life is your Father: I know he is a poor Man; but is he as low and as hone&s;t, as he was when my Mother took you?</P>
<P>Then I could &s;peak a little, and with a down Look, (and I felt my Face glow like Fire) I &s;aid, Yes, Sir, as <HI>poor</HI> and as <HI>hone&s;t</HI> too; and that is my Pride. Says he, I will do &s;omething for him, if it be not your Fault, and make all your Family happy. Ah! Sir, &s;aid I, he is happier already than ever he can be, if his Daughter's Innocence is to be the Price of your Favour. And I beg you will not &s;peak to me on the <HI>only</HI> Side that can wound me. I have no De&s;ign of that &s;ort, &s;aid he. O Sir, &s;aid I, tell me not &s;o, tell me not &s;o! &mdash; 'Tis ea&s;y, &s;aid he, for me to be the Making of your Father, without injuring you. Well, Sir, &s;aid I, if this can be done, let me know how; and all I can do with Innocence &s;hall be the Study and Practice of my Life.&mdash;But Oh! what can &s;uch a poor Creature as I do, and do my Duty? &mdash; Said he, I would have you &s;tay a Week or a Fortnight only, and behave your&s;elf
<PB N="104" REF="141">
with Kindne&s;s to me: I &s;toop to beg it of you, and you &s;hall &s;ee all &s;hall turn out beyond your Expectation. I &s;ee, &s;aid he, you are going to an&s;wer otherwi&s;e than I would have you; and I begin to be vex'd I &s;hould thus meanly &s;ue; and &s;o I will &s;ay, that your Behavi|our before hone&s;t <HI>Longman,</HI> when I u&s;ed you as I did, and you could &s;o well have vindicated your&s;elf, has quite charmed me. And tho' I am not plea&s;ed with all you &s;aid Ye&s;terday while I was in the Clo&s;er, yet you have mov'd me more to admire you than be|fore; and I am awaken'd to &s;ee more Worthine&s;s in you, than ever I &s;aw in any Lady in the World. All the Servants, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, doat upon you, in&s;tead of envying you; and look upon you in &s;o &s;uperior a Light, as &s;peaks what you ought to be. I have &s;een more of your Letters than you imagine, (This &s;urpris'd me!) and am quite overcome with your charming Manner of Writing, &s;o free, &s;o ea&s;y, and many of your Sentiments &s;o much above your Years, and your Sex; and all put together, makes me, as I tell you, love you to Extravagance. Now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> when I have &s;toop'd &s;o low as to ac|knowledge all this, oblige me only to &s;tay another Week or Fortnight, to give me time to bring about &s;ome certain Affairs; and you &s;hall &s;ee how much you &s;hall find your Account in it.</P>
<P>I trembled to find my poor Heart giving Way.&mdash;O good Sir, &s;aid I, &s;pare a poor Maiden, that cannot look up to you, and &s;peak. My Heart is full: And why &s;hould you wi&s;h to undo me!&mdash;Only oblige me, &s;aid he, to &s;tay a Fortnight longer, and <HI>John</HI> &s;hall carry Word to your Father, that I will &s;ee him in the Time, either here or at the <HI>Swan</HI> in his Village. O Sir, &s;aid I, my Heart will bur&s;t; but on my bended Knees, I beg you to let me go To-morrow, as I de|&s;ign'd: And don't offer to tempt a poor Creature,
<PB N="105" REF="142">
who&s;e whole Will would be to do yours, if my Virtue would permit.&mdash;It &s;hall permit it, &s;aid he; for I intend no Injury to you, God is my Witne&s;s!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible! &s;aid I; I cannot, Sir, believe you, after what has pa&s;&s;ed: How many Ways are there to undo poor Creatures! Good God, protect me this <HI>one</HI> Time, and &s;end me but to my dear Father's Cot in Safety! &mdash; Strange, damn'd Fate! &s;ays he, that when I &s;peak &s;o &s;olemnly, I can't be believ'd!&mdash;What <HI>&s;hould</HI> I believe, Sir? &s;aid I; what <HI>can</HI> I believe? What have you &s;aid, but that I am to &s;tay a Fortnight longer? and what then is to become of me? &mdash; My Pride of Birth and Fortune (damn them both! &s;aid he, &s;ince they cannot obtain Credit with you, but mu&s;t add to your Su&s;picions) will not let me &s;toop at once; and I ask you but a Fort|night's Stay, that after this Declaration, I may pacify tho&s;e proud Demands upon me.</P>
<P>O how my Heart throbb'd! and I began, for I did not know what I did, to &s;ay the Lord's Prayer. None of your Beads to me, <HI>Pamela!</HI> &s;aid he; thou art a perfect Nun, I think.</P>
<P>But I &s;aid aloud, with my Eyes lifted up to Heaven, <HI>Lead me not into Temptation. But deliver me from Evil,</HI> O my good God! He hugg'd me in his Arms, and &s;aid, Well, my dear Girl, then you &s;tay this Fort|night, and you &s;hall &s;ee what I will do for you.&mdash;I'll leave you a Moment, and walk into the next Room, to give you time to think of it, and to &s;hew you I have no De&s;ign upon you. Well, this, I thought, did not look ami&s;s.</P>
<P>He went out, and I was tortur'd with twenty dif|ferent Thoughts in a Minute; &s;ometimes I thought, that to &s;tay a Week or Fortnight longer in this Hou&s;e to obey him, while Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was with me could do no great Harm: But then, thought I, how
<PB N="106" REF="143">
do I know what I may be <HI>able</HI> to do? I have with|&s;tood his <HI>Anger</HI>; but may I not relent at his <HI>Kindne&s;s?</HI> &mdash;How &s;hall I &s;tand <HI>that!</HI> &mdash; Well, I hope, thought I, by the &s;ame protecting Grace in which I will always confide!&mdash;But then, what has he promi&s;ed? Why he will make my poor Father and Mother's Life com|fortable. O, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, that is a rich Thought; but let me not dwell upon it, for fear I &s;hould indulge it to my Ruin.&mdash;What can he do for <HI>me,</HI> poor Girl as I am!&mdash;What can his Greatne&s;s &s;toop to! He talks, thought I, of his Pride of Heart, and Pride of Con|dition; O the&s;e are in his <HI>Head,</HI> and in his <HI>Heart</HI> too, or he would not confe&s;s them to me at <HI>&s;uch</HI> an In&s;tant. Well then, thought I, this can be only to &s;educe me! &mdash;He has promi&s;ed nothing. &mdash; But I am to <HI>&s;ee</HI> what he will do, if I &s;tay a Fortnight; and this Fortnight, thought I again, is no &s;uch great Matter; and I &s;hall &s;ee in a few Days, how he carries it. &mdash; But then, when I again reflected upon the Di&s;tance between him and me, and his now open Declaration of Love, as he called it, and that after this, he would talk with me on that Subject <HI>more plainly</HI> than ever, and I &s;hould be <HI>le&s;s</HI> arm'd, may-be, to with&s;tand him; and then I bethought my&s;elf, why, if he meant no Di&s;honour, he &s;hould not &s;peak before Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; and the odi|ous frightful Clo&s;et came again into my Head, and my narrow E&s;cape upon it; and how ea&s;y it might be for him to &s;end Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and the Maids out of the way; and &s;o that all the Mi&s;chief he de&s;ign'd me might be brought about in le&s;s than that Time; I re&s;olv'd to go away, and tru&s;t all to Providence, and nothing to my&s;elf. And how ought I to be thankful for this Re&s;o|lution! &mdash; as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>But ju&s;t as I have writ to this Place, <HI>John</HI> &s;ends me Word, that he is going this Minute your Way;

But, &s;aid he, you are &s;o pretty, that go where you will, you'll never be free from the De&s;igns of &s;ome or other of our Sex; and I &s;hall think I don't an&s;wer the Care of my dying Mo|ther for you, who committed you to me, if I don't provide you a Husband to protect your Virtue and your Innocence; and a worthy one I have thought of for you.</P>
<P>O black, perfidious Creature! thought I, what an Implement art thou in the Hands of <HI>Lucifer,</HI> to ruin the innocent Heart!&mdash;But &s;till I di&s;&s;embled; for I fear'd much both him and the Place I was in. But, whom, pray, Sir, have you thought of?&mdash;Why, &s;aid be, young Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> my Chaplain, in <HI>Lincoln|&s;hire,</HI> who will make you happy. Does he know, Sir, &s;aid I, any thing of your Honour's Intentions? &mdash; No, my Girl, &s;aid he, and ki&s;&s;ed me (much again&s;t my Will; for his very Breath was now Poi&s;on to me); but his Dependence upon my Favour, and your Beauty and Merit, will make him rejoice at my Kindne&s;s to him. Well, Sir, &s;aid I, then it is time enough to con&s;ider of this Matter; and this
<PB N="109" REF="146">
cannot hinder me from going to my Father's: For what will &s;taying a Fortnight longer &s;ignify to this? Your Honour's Care and Goodne&s;s may extend to me <HI>there</HI> as well as <HI>here</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and all the World, &s;hall know that I am not a&s;hamed of my Father's Poverty.</P>
<P>He would ki&s;s me again, and I &s;aid, if I am to think of Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> or any body, I beg <HI>you'll</HI> not be &s;o free with me: That is not pretty, I'm &s;ure. Well, &s;aid he, but you &s;tay this next Fortnight, and in that time I'll have both <HI>Williams</HI> and your Father here; for I will have the Match concluded in my Hou&s;e; and when I have brought it on, you &s;hall &s;ettle it as you plea&s;e together. Mean time take and &s;end only the&s;e Fifty Pieces to your Father, as an Earne&s;t of my Favour, and I'll make you all happy.&mdash;Sir, &s;aid I, I beg at lea&s;t two Hours to con&s;ider of this. I &s;hall, &s;aid he, be gone out in one Hour; and I would have you write to your Father, what I propo&s;e, and <HI>John</HI> &s;hall carry it on purpo&s;e, and he &s;hall take the Pur&s;e with him for the good old Man, if you approve it. Sir, &s;aid I, I will then let you know in one Hour my Re&s;olution. Do &s;o, &s;aid he; and gave me another Ki&s;s, and let me go.</P>
<P>O how I rejoiced I had got out of his Clutches!&mdash; So I write you this, that you may &s;ee how Matters &s;tand; for I am re&s;olved to come away if po&s;&s;ible. Ba&s;e, wicked, treacherous Gentleman, as he is!</P>
<P>So here was a Trap laid for your poor <HI>Pamela!</HI> I tremble to think of it! O what a Scene of Wic|kedne&s;s was here laid down for all my wretched Life! Black-hearted Wretch! how I hate him?&mdash;For at fir&s;t, as you'll &s;ee by what I have written, he would have made me believe other Things; and this of Mr. <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> I believe, came into his Head after he walked out from his Clo&s;et, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to give him&s;elf time
<PB N="110" REF="147">
to think how to delude me better: But the Covering was now too thin, and ea&s;y to be &s;een through.</P>
<P>I went to my Chamber, and the fir&s;t thing I did, was to write to him; for I thought it was be&s;t not to &s;ee him again, if I could help it; and I put it under his Parlour-door, after I had copy'd it, as follows:

<P><PB N="115" REF="152">It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erv'd, that the Me&s;&s;enger of her Letters to her Father, who &s;o often pretended Bu&s;i|ne&s;s that way, was an Implement in his Ma&s;ter's Hands, and employ'd by him for that Purpo&s;e; and who always gave her Letters fir&s;t to him, and his Ma&s;ter u&s;ed to open and read them, and then &s;end them on; by which means, as he hints to her, (as &s;he ob&s;erves in one of her Letters, <HI>p.</HI> 104.) he was no Stranger to what &s;he wrote.

<P>Why, <HI>London</HI> is a great way off, &s;aid the 'Squire, and I can't &s;end for her back pre&s;ently. What, then, &s;aid he, have you &s;ent my poor <HI>Pamela</HI> to <HI>London?</HI> I would not have it &s;aid &s;o, &s;ays the 'Squire; but I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my Honour, &s;he is quite &s;afe and &s;atisfied, and will quickly inform you of as much by Letter. I am &s;ure &s;he is in a reputable Family, no le&s;s than a Bi&s;hop's; and will wait on his Lady till I get this Matter over, that I mentioned to you</P>
<P>O how &s;hall I know this? reply'd he &mdash; What! &s;aid the 'Squire, pretending Anger, am I to be doubted? &mdash; Do you believe I can have any View upon your Daughter? And if I had, do you think I would take &s;uch Methods as the&s;e to effect it? Why, Man, you know not whom you talk to! &mdash;O Sir, &s;aid he, I beg your Pardon; but con&s;ider, my dear Child is in the Ca&s;e: Let me know what Bi&s;hop, and where; and I will travel to <HI>London</HI> barefoot, to &s;ee my Daughter, and then &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Why, Goodman <HI>Andrews,</HI> I think thou ha&s;t read Romances as well as thy Daughter, and thy Head's turn'd with them. May I not have my Word taken? Do you think, once more, I would offer any thing to your Daughter? Is there any thing looks like it?&mdash; Pr'ythee, Man, con&s;ider a little who I am; and if I am not to be believ'd, what &s;ignifies talking?
<PB N="121" REF="158">
Why, Sir, &s;aid he, pray forgive me; but there is no Harm to &s;ay, What Bi&s;hop's, or whereabouts? What, and &s;o you'd go troubling his Lord&s;hip with your impertinent Fears and Stories! Will you be &s;atisfied if you have a Letter from her within a Week, it may be le&s;s, if &s;he be not negligent, to a&s;&s;ure you all is well with her? Why, that, &s;aid the poor Man, will be a Comfort. Well then, &s;aid the Gentleman, I can't an&s;wer for her Negligence, if &s;he don't; but &s;he will &s;end a Letter to you, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>; for I de|&s;ire not to &s;ee it; I have had Trouble enough about her already; and be &s;ure you &s;end it by a Man and Hor&s;e the Moment you receive it. To be &s;ure I will, &s;aid &s;he. Thank your Honour, &s;aid the good Man: And then I mu&s;t wait with as much Patience as I can for a Week, which will be a Year to me.</P>
<P>I tell you, &s;aid the Gentleman, it mu&s;t be her own Fault if &s;he don't; for 'tis what I in&s;i&s;ted upon for my own Reputation; and I &s;han't &s;tir from this Hou&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, till &s;he is heard from, and that to Sati&s;|faction.

<P>He then, whi&s;pering her, bid her give him a couple of Guineas to bear his Charges home; telling him, he &s;hould be welcome to &s;tay there till the Letter came, if he would; and he &s;hould be a Witne&s;s, that he intended honourably, and not to &s;tir from his Hou&s;e for one while.</P>
<P>The poor old Man &s;taid and din'd with Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> with &s;ome tolerable Ea&s;e of Mind, in hopes to hear from his beloved Daughter in a few Days; and then accepting the Pre&s;ent, return'd for his own Hou&s;e; and re&s;olv'd to be as patient as po&s;&s;ible for a few Days.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="159">Mean time Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and all the Family, were in the utmo&s;t Grief for the Trick put upon the poor <HI>Pamela</HI> and &s;he and the Steward repre&s;ented it to their Ma&s;ter in as moving Terms as they dur&s;t: But were forc'd to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with his general A&s;&s;urances of intending her no Harm; which, however, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> little believ'd, from the Pretence he had made in his Letter, of the Corre&s;pondence between <HI>Pamela</HI> and the young Par&s;on, which &s;he knew to be all In|vention, tho' &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ay &s;o.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>O my deare&s;t Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me write and bewail my mi&s;erable hard Fate, tho' I have no Hope, that what I write will be convey'd to your Hands!&mdash; I have now nothing
<PB N="124" REF="161">
to do but write, and weep, and fear,and pray! But yet what can I hope for, when I &s;eem to be devoted, as a Victim to the Will of a wicked Violator of all the Laws of God and Man?&mdash;But, gracious Heaven, forgive me my Ra&s;hne&s;s and De&s;pondency! O let me not &s;in again&s;t thee; for thou be&s;t knowe&s;t what is fitte&s;t for thy poor Handmaid:&mdash;And as thou &s;uffere&s;t not thy poor Creatures to be tempted above what they can bear, I will re&s;ign to thy good Plea&s;ure. And &s;till, I hope, de&s;perate as my Condition &s;eems, that as tho&s;e Trials are not of my own &s;eeking, nor the Effects of ray Pre&s;umption and Vanity, I &s;hall be enabled to overcome them, and, in God's own good Time, be delivered from them.</P>
<P>Thus do I pray, imperfectly as I am forced by my di&s;tracting Fears and Apprehen&s;ions; and O join with me, my dear Parents!&mdash;But, alas! how can you know, how can I reveal to you, the dreadful Situa|tion of your poor Daughter? The unhappy <HI>Pa|mela</HI> may be undone, (which God forbid, and &s;ooner deprive me of Life I) before you can know my hard Lot.</P>
<P>O the unparallel'd Wickedne&s;s, Stratagems, and Devices of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Gentlemen, and pervert the De&s;ign of Providence, in giving them ample Means to do Good, to their own Perdition, and to the Ruin of poor oppre&s;&s;ed Innocence!</P>
<P>But let me tell you what has befallen me; and yet, how &s;hall you receive it? For I have now no hone&s;t <HI>John</HI> to carry my Letters to you; but am likely to be watch'd in all my Steps, till my hard Fate ripens his wicked Projects for my Ruin. I will every Day now write my &s;ad State; and &s;ome way, perhaps, may be open'd to &s;end the melancholy Scribble to you. But if you <HI>know</HI> it, what will it do but aggravate your Troubles? For, O! what can the
<PB N="125" REF="162">
abject Poor do again&s;t the mighty Rich, when they are determined to oppre&s;s?</P>
<P>Well, but I will proceed to write what I had hoped to tell you in a few Hours, that I believed I &s;hould receive your grateful Ble&s;&s;ings, on my Return to you from &s;o many Hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>I will begin here with my Account from the la&s;t Letter I wrote you, in which I inclo&s;ed my poor Stuff of Ver&s;es; and continue it at times, as I have Oppor|tunity; tho', as I &s;aid, I know not how it can reach you now.</P>
<P>The long hop'd-for <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning came, that I was to &s;et out. I had taken my Leave of my Fel|low-&s;ervants over-night; and a mournful Leave it was to us all: For Men, as well as Women-&s;ervants, wept much to part with me; and, for <HI>my</HI> Part, I was overwhelm'd with Tears, and the affecting In&s;tances of their E&s;teem. They all would have made me little Pre&s;ents, as Tokens of their Love; but I would not take any thing from the lower Servants, to be &s;ure. But Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> made me a Pre&s;ent of &s;everal Yards of <HI>Holland,</HI> and a Silver Snuff-box, and a Gold Ring, which he de&s;ir'd me to keep for his &s;ake; and he wept over me; but &s;aid, I am &s;ure, &s;o good a Maiden God will ble&s;s; and tho' you return to your poor Father again, and his low E&s;tate, yet Providence will find you out; and <HI>one</HI> Day, tho' I mayn't live to &s;ee it, you <HI>will</HI> be rewarded.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, O dear Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> you make me too rich, and too mody; and yet I mu&s;t be a Beggar before my Time: For I &s;hall want often to be &s;cribbling, (little thinking it would be my only Employment &s;o &s;oon) and I will beg you, Sir, to favour me with &s;ome Pa|per; and as &s;oon as I get home, I will write you a Letter, to thank you for all your Kindne&s;s to me; and a Letter to good Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> too.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="163">This was lucky; for I &s;hould have had none el&s;e, but at Plea&s;ure of my rough-natur'd Governe&s;s, as I may call her; but now I can write to ea&s;e my Mind, tho' I can't &s;end it to you; and write what I plea&s;e, for &s;he knows not how well I am provided. For good Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> gave me above forty Sheets of Paper, and a dozen Pens, and a little Phial of Ink; which la&s;t I wrapt in Paper, and put in my Pocket; and &s;ome Wax and Wafers.</P>
<P>O dear Sir, &s;aid I, you have &s;et me up. How &s;hall I requite you? He &s;aid, By a Ki&s;s, my fair Mi&s;tre&s;s; and I gave it very willingly; for he is a good old Man.</P>
<P><HI>Rachel</HI> and <HI>Hannah</HI> cry'd &s;adly when I took my Leave, and <HI>Jane,</HI> who &s;ometimes u&s;ed to be a little cro&s;&s;i&s;h, and <HI>Cicely</HI> too, wept &s;adly, and &s;aid they would pray for me; but poor <HI>Jane,</HI> I doubt, &s;eldom &s;ays her Prayers for her&s;elf: More's the Pity!</P>
<P>Then <HI>Arthur</HI> the Gardener, our <HI>Robin</HI> the Coach|man, and <HI>Lincoln&s;hire Robin</HI> too, who was to carry me, were very civil; and both had Tears in their Eyes; which I thought then very good-natur'd in <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire Robin,</HI> becau&s;e he knew but little of me.&mdash; But &s;ince, I find he might well be concern'd; for he had then his In&s;tructions, it &s;eems, and knew how he was to be a Means to entrap me.</P>
<P>Then our other three Footmen, <HI>Harry, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and Grooms, and Helpers, were very much affected likewi&s;e; and the poor little Scullion-boy, <HI>Tommy,</HI> was ready to run over for Grief.</P>
<P>They had got all together over-night, expecting to be differently employ'd in the Morning; and they all begg'd to &s;hake Hands with me, and I ki&s;s'd the Maidens, and pray'd to God to ble&s;s them all; and thanked them for all their Love and Kindne&s;&s;es to
<PB N="127" REF="164">
me: And indeed I was forced to leave them &s;ooner than I would, becau&s;e I could not &s;tand it: Indeed I could not. <HI>Harry</HI> (I could not have thought it; for he is a little wildi&s;h, they &s;ay) cry'd till he &s;obb'd again. <HI>John,</HI> poor honed <HI>John,</HI> was not then come back from you. But as for the Butler, Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> he could not &s;tay in Company.</P>
<P>I thought to have told you a deal about this; but I have wor&s;e things to employ my Thoughts.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> cry'd all Night long; and I comforted her all I could: and &s;he made me promi&s;e, that if my Ma&s;ter went to <HI>London</HI> to attend Parliament, or to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> I would come and &s;tay a Week with her. And &s;he would have given me Money; but: I would not take it.</P>
<P>Well, next Morning came, and I wonder'd I &s;aw nothing of poor hone&s;t <HI>John</HI>; for I waited to take Leave of him, and thank him for all his Civilities to me and to you: But I &s;uppo&s;e he was &s;ent further by my Ma&s;ter, and &s;o could not return; and I de&s;ired to be remember'd to him.</P>
<P>And when Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> told me, with a &s;ad Heart, the Chariot was ready, with four Hor&s;es to it, I was ju&s;t upon &s;inking into the Ground, tho' I wanted to be with you.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter was above Stairs, and never asked to &s;ee me. I was glad of it in the main; but he knew, fal&s;e Heart as he is! that I was not to be out of his Reach.&mdash;O pre&s;erve me. Heaven, from his Power, and from his Wickedne&s;s!</P>
<P>Well, they were not &s;uffer'd to go with me one Step, as I writ to you before; for he &s;tood at the Win|dow to &s;ee me go. And in the Pa&s;&s;age to the Gate, out of his Sight, there they &s;tood all of them, in two Rows; and we could &s;ay nothing on both Sides, but,
<PB N="128" REF="165">
God ble&s;s you! and God ble&s;s you! But <HI>Harry</HI> carried my own Bundle, my third Bundle, as I was u&s;ed to call it, to the Coach, and &s;ome Plum-cakes, and Diet-bread, made for me over-night, and &s;ome Sweat-meats, and &s;ix Bottles of <HI>Canary</HI> Wine, which Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> would make me take in a Basket, to chear our Hearts now-and-then when we got toge|ther, as &s;he &s;aid. And I ki&s;&s;ed all the Maids again, and &s;hook Hands with the Men again; but Mr. <HI>Jona|than</HI> and Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> were not there; and then I tript down Steps to the Chariot, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> crying mo&s;t &s;adly.</P>
<P>I look'd up when I got to the Chariot, and I &s;aw my Ma&s;ter at the Window, in his Gown; and I curt'&s;y'd three times to him very low, and pray'd for him with my Hands lifted up; for I could not &s;peak; indeed I was not able. And he bow'd his Head to me, which made me then very glad he would take &s;uch Notice of me; and in I &s;tept, and was ready to bur&s;t with Grief; and could only, till <HI>Robin</HI> began to drive, wave my white Handkerchief to them, wet with my Tears. And at la&s;t away he drove, <HI>Jehu-like,</HI> as they &s;ay, out of the Court-yard: And I too &s;oon found I had Cau&s;e for greater and deeper Grief.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, at this rate I &s;hall &s;oon be with my dear Father and Mother; and till I had got, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, half-way, I thought of the good Friends I had left. And when, on &s;topping for a little Bait to the Hor&s;es, <HI>Robin</HI> told me, I was near half-way, I thought it was high time to wipe my Eyes, and think to whom I was going; as then, alack for me! I thought. So I began to ponder what a Meeting I &s;hould have with you; how glad you'd both be to &s;ee me come &s;afe and innocent to you, after all my Dangers; and &s;o I began to comfort my|&s;elf, and to bani&s;h the other gloomy Side from my Mind; tho', too, it return'd now-and-then; for
<PB N="129" REF="166">
I &s;hould be ingrateful not to love them, for their Love.</P>
<P>Well, I believe, I &s;et out about Eight o'Clock in the Morning; and I wonder'd, and wonder'd, when it was about Two, as I &s;aw by a Church-dial in a little Village we pa&s;s'd thro', that I was &s;till more and more out of my Knowledge. Hey-day! thought I, to drive this &s;trange Pace, and to be &s;o long a-going little more than twenty Miles, is very odd! But, to be &s;ure, thought I, <HI>Robin</HI> knows the Way.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he &s;topt, and look'd about him, as if he was at a Lo&s;s for the Way; and I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> &s;ure you are out of the Way!&mdash;I'm afraid I am, &s;aid he. But it can't be much; I'll ask the fir&s;t Per&s;on I &s;ee. Pray do, &s;aid I; and he gave his Hor&s;es a Mouthful of Hay; and I gave him &s;ome Cake, and two Gla&s;&s;es of <HI>Canary</HI> Wine; and &s;topt about half an Hour in all. Then he drove on very fa&s;t again.</P>
<P>I had &s;o much to think of, of the Dangers I now doubted not I had e&s;caped, of the loving Friends I had left, and my be&s;t Friends I was going to, and the many things I had to relate to you; that I the le&s;s thought of the Way, till I was &s;tartled out of my Meditations by the Sun beginning to &s;et, and &s;till the Man driving on, and his Hor&s;es &s;weating and foaming; and then I began to be alarm'd all at once, and call'd to him; and he &s;aid he had horrid ill Luck, for he had come &s;everal Miles out of the Way, but was now right, and &s;hould get in &s;till before it was quite dark. My Heart began then to mi&s;give me a little, and I was very much fatigued; for I had no Sleep for &s;everal Nights before, to &s;ignify; and at la&s;t I &s;aid, Pray, Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> there is a Town before us; what do you call it?&mdash; If we are &s;o much out of the Way, we had better put up there; for the Night comes on apace: And, Lord protect me! thought I, I &s;hall
<PB N="130" REF="167">
have new Dangers, may-hap, to encounter with the <HI>Man,</HI> who have e&s;caped the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> &mdash; little thinking of the ba&s;e Contrivance of the latter. Says he, I am ju&s;t there, 'tis but a Mile on one Side of the Town before us &mdash; Nay, &s;aid I, I may be mi&s;taken; for it is a good while &s;ince I was this Way; but I am &s;ure the Face of the Country here is nothing like what I remember it.</P>
<P>He pretended to be much out of Humour with him&s;elf for mi&s;taking the Way, and at la&s;t &s;topt at a Farm-hou&s;e, about two Miles beyond the Village I had &s;een; and it was then almo&s;t dark, and he alighted, and &s;aid, We mu&s;t make &s;hift here; for I am quite out.</P>
<P>Lord, thought I, be good to the poor <HI>Pamela!</HI> More Trials &s;till!&mdash;What will befal me next?</P>
<P>The Farmer's Wife, and Maid, and Daughter, came out; and the Wife &s;aid, What brings you this Way at this time of Night, Mr. <HI>Robert?</HI> And with a Lady too?&mdash;Then I began to be frighten'd out of my Wits; and laying Middle and both Ends together, I fell a crying, and &s;aid, God give me Patience! I am undone for certain I &mdash; Pray, Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid I, do you know E&s;quire <HI>B.</HI> of <HI>Bedford&s;hire?</HI></P>
<P>The wicked Coachman would have prevented the an&s;wering me; but the &s;imple Daughter &s;aid, Know his Wor&s;hip! yes, &s;urely! why he is my Father's Landlord!&mdash;Well, &s;aid I, then I am undone, undone for ever!&mdash;O wicked Wretch! what have I done to you, &s;aid I to the Coachman, to &s;erve me thus?&mdash; Vile Tool of a wicked Ma&s;ter! &mdash;Faith, &s;aid the Fel|low, I'm &s;orry this Task was put upon me: But I could not help it. But make the be&s;t of it now; here are very civil, reputable Folks; and you'll be &s;afe here, I'll a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;Let me get out, &s;aid I, and I'll walk back to the Town we came through, late as it is:&mdash;For I will not enter here.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="168">Said the Farmer's Wife, You'll be very well u&s;ed here, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, young Gentlewoman, and have better Conveniencies than any-where in the Village. I matter not Conveniencies, &s;aid I: I am betray'd and undone! As you have a Daughter of your <HI>own,</HI> pity me, and let me know, if your Landlord, as you call him, be here!&mdash; No, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, he is not, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>And then came the Farmer, a good-like &s;ort of Man, grave, and well-behav'd; and he &s;poke to me in &s;uch &s;ort, as made me a little pacify'd; and &s;eeing no Help for it, I went in; and the Wife immediately conducted me up Stairs to the be&s;t Apartment, and told me, that was mine as long as I &s;taid; and nobody &s;hould come near me but when I call'd. I threw my&s;elf on the Bed in the Room, tir'd, and frighten'd to Death almo&s;t, and gave way to the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive Fit of Grief that I ever had.</P>
<P>The Daughter came up, and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> had given her a Letter to give me; and <HI>there</HI> it was. I rai&s;ed my&s;elf, and &s;aw it was the Hand and Seal of the wicked Wretch my Ma&s;ter, directed To Mrs. <HI>Pa|mela Andrews.</HI>&mdash;This was a little better than to have him here; tho', if he had, he mu&s;t have been brought thro' the Air; for I thought <HI>I</HI> was.</P>
<P>The good Woman (for I began to &s;ee Things about a little reputable, and no Guile appearing in them, but rather a Face of Grief for my Grief) offered me a Gla&s;s of &s;ome cordial Water, which I accepted, for I was ready to &s;ink; and then I &s;at up in a Chair a little, tho' very fainti&s;h: And they brought me two Candles, and lighted a Bru&s;h-wood Fire; and &s;aid, If I call'd, I &s;hould be waited upon in&s;tantly; and &s;o left me to ruminate on my &s;ad Condition, and to read my Letter, which I was not able to do pre|&s;ently.

<P>I but too well apprehended, that this Letter was only to pacify me for the pre&s;ent; but as my Danger was not &s;o immediate as I had Rea&s;on to dread, and he had promi&s;ed to forbear coming to me, and to write to you, my dear Parents, to quiet your Con|cern, I was a little more ea&s;y than I was before: And I made &s;hift to eat a little Bit of boil'd Chicken they had got for me, and drank a Gla&s;s of my Sack, and made each of them do &s;o too.</P>
<P>But after I had &s;o done, I was again a little flu|&s;ter'd; for in came the Coachman with the Look of a Hangman, I thought, and <HI>Madam'd</HI> me up &s;trangely; telling me, he would beg me to get ready to pur&s;ue my Journey by Five in the Morning, or el&s;e he &s;hould be late in. I was quite griev'd at this; for I began not to di&s;like my Company, con&s;idering how Things &s;tood, and was in Hopes to get a Party among them, and &s;o to put my&s;elf into any worthy Protection in the Neighbourhood, rather than go forward.</P>
<P>When he withdrew, I began to tamper with the Farmer and his Wife. But, alas! they had had a Letter deliver'd them at the &s;ame time I had; &s;o &s;ecurely had <HI>Lucifer</HI> put it into his Head to do his Work; and they only &s;hook their Heads, and &s;eem'd to pity me; and &s;o I was forced to give over that Hope.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>He had &s;aid, too cunningly for me, that I would not <HI>own</HI> this pretended Love Affair; &s;o that he had provided them not to believe me, &s;ay what I would; and as they were his Tenants, who all love him, (for he has &s;ome good Qualities, and &s;o he had need!) I &s;aw all my Plot cut out, and &s;o was forc'd to &s;ay the le&s;s.</P>
<P>I wept bitterly, however; for I found he was too hard for me, as well in his Contrivances as Riches; and &s;o had recour&s;e again to my only Refuge, that God, who takes the innocent Heart into his Protection, and is alone able to baffle and confound the Devices of the Mighty. Nay, the
<PB N="135" REF="172">
Farmer was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Contents of his Letter to him, that he began to prai&s;e his Care and Concern for me, and to advi&s;e me again&s;t en|tertaining Addre&s;&s;es without my Friends Advice and Con&s;ent, and made me the Subject of a Le&s;&s;on for his Daughter's Improvement. So I was glad to &s;hut up this Di&s;cour&s;e; for I &s;aw I was not likely to be believ'd.</P>
<P>I &s;ent, however, to tell my Driver, that I was &s;o fatigued, I could not &s;et out &s;o &s;oon the next Morn|ing. But he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, and &s;aid. It would make my Day's Journey the lighter; and I found he was a more faithful Servant to his Ma&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding what he wrote of his Reluctance, than I could have wi&s;h'd: So I &s;aw &s;till more and more, that all was deep Di&s;&s;imulation, and Contrivance wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed I might have &s;hewn them his Letter to me, as a full Confutation of his to them; but I &s;aw no Probability of engaging them in my Behalf; and &s;o thought it &s;ignify'd little, as I was to go away &s;o &s;oon, to enter more particularly into the Matter with them; and be&s;ides, I &s;aw they were not inclinable to let me &s;tay longer for fear of di&s;obliging him: So I went to Bed, but had very little Re&s;t: And they would make their Servant-maid bear me Company in the Chariot five Miles, early in the Morning, and &s;he was to walk back.</P>
<P>I had contriv'd in my Thoughts, when I was on my Way in the Chariot, on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, that when we came into &s;ome Town, to bait, as he mu&s;t do for the Hor&s;es &s;ake, I would, at the Inn, apply my&s;elf, if I &s;aw I any way could, to the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Inn, and tell her the Ca&s;e, and refu&s;e to go far|ther, having nobody but this wicked Coachman to contend with.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="173">Well, I was very full of this Project, and was in great Hopes, &s;ome-how or other, to extricare my&s;elf this way. But, Oh! the artful Wretch had provided for even this la&s;t Re&s;ource of mine; for when we came to put up at a large Town on the Way, to eat a Mor&s;el for Dinner, and I was fully re&s;olv'd to execure my Project, who &s;hould be at the Inn that he put up at, but the wicked Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> expecting me! And her Si&s;ter-in-law was the Mi&s;tre&s;s of it; and &s;he had provided a little Entertainment for me.</P>
<P>And this I found, when I de&s;ir'd, as &s;oon as I came in, to &s;peak with the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e. She came to me, and I &s;aid, I am a poor unhappy young Body, that want your Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and you &s;eem to be a good &s;ort of Gentlewoman, that would a&s;&s;i&s;t an oppre&s;&s;ed innocent Per&s;on. Yes, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I hope you gue&s;s right, and I have the Happine&s;s to know &s;omething of the Matter be|fore you &s;peak. Pray call my Si&s;ter <HI>Jewkes.&mdash; Jewkes! Jewkes!</HI> thought I; I have heard of that Name; I don't like it.</P>
<P>Then the wicked Creature appear'd, whom I had never &s;een but once before, and I was terrify'd out of my Wits. No Stratagem, thought I, not <HI>one!</HI> for a poor innocent Girl; but every thing to turn out again&s;t me; that is hard indeed!</P>
<P>So I began to pull in my Horns, as they &s;ay; for I &s;aw I was now wor&s;e off than at the Farmer's.</P>
<P>The naughty Woman came up to me with an Air of Confidence, and ki&s;s'd me: See, Si&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, here's a charming Creature! Would &s;he not tempt the be&s;t Lord in the Land to run away with her? O frightfull thought I; here's an Avowal of the Mat|ter at once: I am now gone, that's certain. And &s;o was quite &s;ilent and confounded; and &s;eeing no Help for it, (for &s;he would not part with me out of her Sight) I was forc'd to &s;et out with her in the
<PB N="137" REF="174">
Chariot; for &s;he came thither on Hor&s;eback with a Man-&s;ervant, who rode by us the re&s;t of the Way, with her Hor&s;e. And now I gave over all Thoughts of Redemption, and was in a de&s;ponding Condition indeed.</P>
<P>Well, thought I, here are &s;trange Pains taken to ruin a poor innocent, helple&s;s, and even <HI>worthle&s;s</HI> young Body. This Plot is laid too deep, and has been too long a hatching, to be baffled, I fear. But then I put my Tru&s;t in God, who I knew was able to do every thing for me, when all other po&s;&s;ible Means &s;hould fail: And in Him I was re&s;olv'd to confide.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee&mdash;(Yet, oh! that kills me; for I know not whether <HI>ever</HI> you may &s;ee what I now write, or no &mdash; El&s;e you may &s;ee) what &s;ort of Woman this Mrs, <HI>Jewkes</HI> is, compar'd to good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> by this&mdash;</P>
<P>Every now-and-then &s;he would be &s;taring in my Face, in the Chariot, and &s;queezing my Hand, and &s;aying, Why, you are very pretty, my &s;ilent Dear! And once &s;he offer'd to ki&s;s me. But I &s;aid, I don't like this Sort of Carriage, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>; it is not like two Per&s;ons of one Sex. She fell a laughing very confidently, and &s;aid, That's prettily &s;aid, I vow! Then thou had&s;t rather be ki&s;s'd by the other Sex? 'Ifackins, I commend thee for that!</P>
<P>I was &s;adly tiez'd with her Impertinence, and bold Way; but no wonder; &s;he was an Inn-keeper's Hou&s;e-keeper before &s;he came to my Ma&s;ter; and tho&s;e Sort of Creatures don't want Confidence, you know. And indeed &s;he made nothing to talk boldly on twenty Occa&s;ions, and &s;aid two or three times, when &s;he &s;aw the Tears every now-and-then, as we rid, trickle down my Checks, I was &s;orely hurt, truly, to have the hand&s;ome&s;t and fine&s;t young Gen|tleman in five Counties in Love with me!</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="175">So I find I am got into the Hands of a wicked Pro|cure&s;s, and if I was not &s;afe with good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and where every body lov'd me, what a dreadful Pro&s;pect have I now before me, in the Hands of a Woman that &s;eems to delight in Filthine&s;s!</P>
<P>O dear Sirs! what &s;hall I do! What &s;hall I do!&mdash; Surely, I &s;hall never be equal to all the&s;e Things!</P>
<P>About Eight at Night, we enter'd the Court-yard of this hand&s;ome, large, old, and lonely Man&s;ion, that looks made for Solitude and Mi&s;chief, as I thought, by its Appearance, with all its brown nodding Horrors of lofty Elms and Pines about it: And here, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, I fear, is to be the Scene of my Ruin, unle&s;s God protect me, who is all-&s;ufficient!</P>
<P>I was very &s;ick at entering it, partly from Fatigue, and partly from Dejection of Spirits: And Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> got me &s;ome mull'd Wine, and &s;eem'd mighty officious to welcome me thither. And while &s;he was ab&s;ent, ordering the Wine, the wicked <HI>Robin</HI> came in to me, and &s;aid, I beg a thou&s;and Pardons for my Part in this Affair, &s;ince I &s;ee your Grief, and your Di&s;tre&s;s; and I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I am &s;orry it fell to my Task.</P>
<P>Mighty well, Mr. <HI>Robert!</HI> &s;aid I; I never &s;aw an Execution but once, and then the Hangman ask'd the poor Creature's Pardon, and wip'd his Mouth, as you do, and pleaded his Duty, and then calmly tuck'd up the Criminal. But I am no Criminal, as you all know: And if I could have thought it my Duty to obey a wicked Ma&s;ter, in his unlawful Commands, I had &s;av'd you all the Merit of this vile Service.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, &s;aid he, you take it &s;o. But every body don't think alike. Well, &s;aid I, you have, done <HI>your</HI> Part, Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> towards my Ruin, very
<PB N="139" REF="176">
faithfully; and will have Cau&s;e to be &s;orry, may-be, at the Long-run, when you &s;hall &s;ee the Mi&s;chief that comes of it.&mdash;Your Eyes were open, and you knew I was to be carry'd to my Father's, and that I was barbarou&s;ly trick'd and betray'd; and I can only, once more, thank you for your Part of it. God for|give you!</P>
<P>So he went away a little &s;ad. What have you &s;aid to <HI>Robin,</HI> Madam? &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> (who came in as he went out): The poor Fellow's ready to cry. I need not be afraid of <HI>your</HI> following his Example, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I: I have been telling him, that he has done <HI>his</HI> Part to my Ruin: And he now can't help it! So his Repentance does <HI>me</HI> no Good; I wi&s;h it may <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould be as ready to cry as he, if I &s;hould do you any Harm. It is not in <HI>his</HI> Power to help it now, &s;aid I; but <HI>your</HI> Part is to come, and you may chu&s;e whether you'll contribute to my Ruin or not.&mdash;Why, look ye, look ye, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I have a great Notion of doing my Duty to my Ma&s;ter; and therefore you may de|pend upon it, if I can do <HI>that,</HI> and &s;erve <HI>you,</HI> I will: But, you mu&s;t think, if <HI>your</HI> De&s;ire, and <HI>his</HI> Will, come to cla&s;h once, I &s;hall do as he bids me, let it be what it will.</P>
<P>Pray, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, don't <HI>Madam</HI> me &s;o: I am but a &s;illy poor Girl, &s;et up by the Gambol of Fortune, for a May-game; and now am to be Something, and now Nothing, ju&s;t as that thinks fit to &s;port with me: And let you and me talk upon a Foot together; for I am a Servant inferior to you, and &s;o much the more as I am turn'd out of Place.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, &s;ays &s;he, I under&s;tand &s;omething of the Matter; you have &s;o great Power over my Ma&s;ter, that you may be &s;oon Mi&s;tre&s;s of us all; and &s;o I
<PB N="140" REF="177">
would oblige you, if I could. And I mu&s;t and will call you Madam; for I am in&s;tructed to &s;hew you all Re&s;pect, I'll a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Who in&s;tructed you to do &s;o? &s;aid I. Who! my Ma&s;ter, to be &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he. Why, &s;aid I, how can that be? You have not &s;een him lately. No, that's true, &s;aid &s;he; but I have been expecting you here &s;ome time (O the deep-laid Wickedne&s;s&punc; thought I); and be&s;ides, I have a Letter of In&s;tructions by <HI>Robin</HI>; but, may-be, I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much. If you would &s;hew them to me, &s;aid I, I &s;hould be able to judge how far I could, or could not, expect Favour from you, con&s;i&s;tent with your Duty to our Ma&s;ter. I beg your Pardon, fair Mi&s;tre&s;s, for that, &s;aid &s;he; I am &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, and you may depend upon it, I will ob&s;erve my Orders; and &s;o far as they will let me, &s;o far will I oblige you; and there's an End of it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, you will not, I hope, do an unlaw|ful or wicked thing, for any Ma&s;ter in the World. Look-ye, &s;aid &s;he, he is my Ma&s;ter; and if he bids me do a thing that I <HI>can</HI> do, I think I <HI>ought</HI> to do it; and let him, who has Power to command me, look to the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of it. Why, &s;aid I, &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould bid you cut my Throat, would you do it? There's no Danger of that, &s;aid &s;he; but to be &s;ure I would not; for then I &s;hould be hang'd; for that would be Murder. Well, &s;aid I, and &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould re&s;olve to en&s;nare a poor young Creature, and ruin her, would you a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that? For to rob a Per&s;on of her Virtue, is wor&s;e than cutting her Throat.</P>
<P>Why now, &s;ays &s;he, how &s;trangely you talk! Are not the two Sexes made for one another? And is it not natural for a Gentleman to love a pretty Woman? And &s;uppo&s;e he can obtain his De&s;ires, is that &s;o bad as cutting her Throat? And then the Wretch fell a
<PB N="141" REF="178">
laughing, and talk'd mo&s;t impertinently, and &s;hew'd me, that I had nothing to expect from her Virtue or Con&s;cience. And this gave me great Mortifica|tion; for I was in hopes of working upon her by degrees.</P>
<P>So we ended our Di&s;cour&s;e here, and I bid her &s;hew me where I mu&s;t lie. &mdash; Why, &s;aid &s;he, lie where you li&s;t, Madam; I can tell you, I mu&s;t lie with you for the pre&s;ent. <HI>For the pre&s;ent!</HI> &s;aid I, and Torture then wrung my Heart! &mdash; But is it in your <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> that you mu&s;t lie with me? Yes, indeed, &s;aid &s;he. I am &s;orry for it, &s;aid I. Why, &s;aid &s;he, I am whol&s;ome and cleanly too, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. Yes, &s;aid I, I don't doubt that; but I love to lie by my&s;elf. How &s;o? &s;aid &s;he; was not Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> your Bed-fellow at t'other Hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, quite &s;ick of her, and my Condition, you mu&s;t do as you are in&s;tructed, I think. I can't help my&s;elf; and am a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Creature.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I am now come down in my Writing to this pre&s;ent SATURDAY, and a deal I have written.</HEAD>
<P>MY wicked Bed-fellow has very punctual Orders, it &s;eems; for &s;he locks me and her&s;elf in, and ties the two Keys (for there is a double Door to the Room) about her Wri&s;t, when &s;he goes to Bed. She talks of the Hou&s;e having been attempted to be broken open two or three times; whether to fright me, I can't tell; but it makes me fearful; tho' not &s;o much as I &s;hould be, if I had not other and greater Fears.</P>
<P>I &s;lept but little la&s;t Night, and got up, and pre|tended to &s;it by the Window which looks into the &s;pacious Gardens; but I was writing all the

time, from Break of Day, to her getting up, and after, when &s;he was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>At Breakfa&s;t &s;he pre&s;ented the two Maids to me, the Cook and Hou&s;e-maid, poor awkward Souls, that I can &s;ee no Hopes of, they &s;eem &s;o devoted to her and Ignorance. Yet I am re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to find &s;ome way to e&s;cape, before this wicked Ma&s;ter comes.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides, of Servants, the Coachman <HI>Ro|bert,</HI> a Groom, a Helper, a Footman; all but <HI>Ro|bert</HI> and he is acce&s;&s;ary to my Ruin) &s;trange Crea|tures, that promi&s;e nothing; and all likewi&s;e devoted to this Woman. The Gardener looks like a good hone&s;t Man; but he is kept at a Di&s;tance, and &s;eems re&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>I wonder'd I &s;aw not Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> the Clergyman, but would not ask after him, apprehending it might give her &s;ome Jealou&s;y; but when I had beheld the re&s;t, he was the only one I had Hopes of; for I thought his Cloth would &s;et him above a&s;&s;i&s;ting in my Ruin &mdash;But in the Afternoon he came; for it &s;eems he has a little <HI>Latin</HI> School in the neighbouring Village, which he attends; and this brings him in a little Matter, additional to my Ma&s;ter's Favour, till &s;omething better falls, of which he has Hopes.</P>
<P>He is a &s;en&s;ible, &s;ober young Gentleman; and when I &s;aw him, I confirm'd my&s;elf in my Hopes of him; for he &s;eem'd to take great Notice of my Di&s;tre&s;s and Grief (for I could not hide it); tho' he appear'd fear|ful of Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> who watch'd all our Motions and Words.</P>
<P>He has an Apartment in the Hou&s;e; but is mo&s;tly at a Lodging in the Town, for Conveniency of his little School; only on <HI>Saturday</HI> Afternoons and <HI>Sun|days:</HI> And he preaches &s;ometimes for the Par&s;on of the Village, which is about three Miles off.</P>

<P>I have ask'd her, for a Feint, (becau&s;e &s;he &s;han't think I am &s;o well provided) to indulge me with Pen and Ink, tho' I have been u&s;ing my own &s;o freely, when her Ab&s;ence would let me; for I begg'd to be left to my&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>No, not at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> may-be, &s;aid &s;he; but I am told you are a great Writer, and it is in my In|&s;tructions to &s;ee all you write; &s;o, look you here, &s;aid &s;he, I will let you have a Pen and Ink, and two Sheets of Paper; for this Employment will keep you out of wor&s;e Thoughts: But I mu&s;t &s;ee them always when I ask, written or not written. That's very hard, &s;aid I; but may I not have to my&s;elf the Clo&s;et in the Room where we lie, with the Key to lock up my Things? I believe I may con&s;ent to that, &s;aid &s;he; and I will &s;et it in Order for you, and leave the Key in the Door. And there is a Spinnet too, &s;aid &s;he; if it be in Tune, you may play to divert you now-and-then; for I know my old Lady learnt you.</P>
<P>So I re&s;olv'd to hide a Pen of my own here, and another there, for fear I &s;hould come to be deny'd, and a little of my Ink in a broken China-cup, and a little in another Cup; and a Sheet of Paper here-and-there among my Linen, with a little Wax, and a few Wafers, in &s;everal Places, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;earch'd; and &s;omething I thought might happen to open a

For, if he comes hither, I am undone, to be &s;ure! For this naughty Woman will a&s;&s;i&s;t him, rather than fail, in the wor&s;t of his Attempts; and he'll have no Occa&s;ion to &s;end her out of the Way, as he would have done Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> once. So I mu&s;t &s;et all my little Wits at Work.</P>
<P>It is a Grief to me to write, and not to be able to &s;end to you what I write; but now it is all the Diver|&s;ion I have, and if God will favour my E&s;cape with my Innocence, as I tru&s;t He graciou&s;ly will, for all the&s;e black Pro&s;pects, with what Plea&s;ure &s;hall I read them afterwards!</P>
<P>I was going to &s;ay, Pray for your dutiful Daughter, as I u&s;ed; but, alas! you cannot know my Di&s;tre&s;s, tho' I am &s;ure I have your Prayers, And I will write on as Things happen, that if a Way &s;hould open, my Scribble may be ready to &s;end.

<HEAD>I am now come to SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>WELL, here is a &s;ad Thing! I am deny'd by this barbarous Woman to go to Church, as I had built upon I might. And &s;he has huffed poor Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> all to-piece;, for pleading for me. I find he is to be forbid the Hou&s;e, if &s;he plea&s;es. Poor Gentleman! all his Dependence is upon my Ma&s;ter, who has a very good Living for him, if the Incumbent die; and he has kept his Bed the&s;e four Months, of old Age and Drop&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="182">He pays me great Re&s;pect, and I &s;ee pities me; and would perhaps a&s;&s;i&s;t my E&s;cape from the&s;e Dan|gers: But I have nobody to plead for me; and why &s;hould I wi&s;h to ruin a poor Gentleman, by engaging him again&s;t his Intere&s;t? Yet one would do any thing to pre&s;erve one's Innocence; and Providence would, perhaps, make it up to <HI>him!</HI></P>
<P>O judge (but how &s;hall you &s;ee what I write!) my di&s;tracted Condition, to be reduc'd to &s;uch a Pa&s;s as to de&s;ire to lay Traps for Mankind! &mdash; But he wants &s;adly to &s;ay &s;omething to me, as he whi&s;per|ingly hinted.</P>
<P>The Wretch (I think I will always call her the <HI>Wretch</HI> henceforth) abu&s;es me more and more. I was but talking to one of the Maids ju&s;t now, indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees; and &s;he popt upon us, and &s;aid&mdash;Nay, Madam, don't offer to tempt poor innocent Country Maidens from doing their Duty. You wanted, I hear, &s;he &s;hould take a Walk with you. But I charge you, <HI>Nan,</HI> never &s;tir with her, nor obey her, without letting me know it, in the &s;malle&s;t Tri&s;les. &mdash; I &s;ay, walk with you! why, where would you go, I tro'? Why, barbarous Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, only to look a little up the Elm-walk, as you would not let me go to Church.</P>
<P><HI>Nan,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, to &s;hew me how much they were all in her Power, pull off Madam's Shoes, and bring them to me.

Nay, &s;aid <HI>Nan,</HI> but I mu&s;t, if my Mi&s;tre&s;s bids me; &s;o pray, Madam, don't hinder me: And &s;o indeed (would you believe it?) &s;he took my Shoes off, and left me barefoot; And, for my Share, I have been &s;o frighten'd at this, that I have not Power even to relieve my Mind by my Tears, I am quite &s;tupify'd, to be &s;ure! &mdash; Here I was forc'd to leave off.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="183">Now I will give you a Picture of this Wretch: She is a broad, &s;quat, pur&s;y, <HI>fat Thing,</HI> quite ugly, if any thing human can be &s;o called; about forty Years old. She has a huge Hand, and an Arm as thick as my Wai&s;t, I believe. Her No&s;e is flat and crooked, and her Brows grow over her Eyes; a dead, &s;piteful, grey, goggling Eye, to be &s;ure &s;he has. And her Face is flat and broad; and as to Colour, looks like as if it had been pickled a Month in Salt-petre: I dare &s;ay &s;he drinks! &mdash;She has a hoar&s;e man-like Voice, and is as thick as &s;he's long; and yet looks &s;o deadly &s;trong, that I am afraid &s;he would da&s;h me at her Foot in an In&s;tant, if I was to vex her. &mdash; So that with a Heart more ugly than her Face, &s;he frightens me &s;adly; and I am undone, to be &s;ure, if God does not protect me; for &s;he is very, very wicked&mdash;indeed &s;he is.</P>
<P>This is but poor helple&s;s Spite in me:&mdash;But the Picture is too near the Truth notwith&s;tanding. She &s;ends me a Me&s;&s;age ju&s;t now, that I &s;hall have my Shoes again, if I will, accept of her Company, to walk with me in the Garden&mdash;To <HI>waddle</HI> with me, rather, thought I.</P>
<P>Well, 'tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to quarrel with her down|right. I &s;hall be watch'd the narrower, if I do; and &s;o I will go with the hated Wretch. &mdash; O for my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI> or rather, to be &s;afe with my dear Fa|ther and Mother!</P>
<P>Oh! I'm out of my Wits for Joy! Ju&s;t as I have got my Shoes on, I am told, <HI>John,</HI> hone&s;t <HI>John,</HI> is come on Hor&s;eback! &mdash; A Ble&s;&s;ing on his faithful Heart!

I mu&s;t not let her know, I am &s;o glad to &s;ee this dear ble&s;&s;ed <HI>John,</HI> to be &s;ure!&mdash;O but he looks &s;ad, as I &s;ee him out of the Window!

Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and every body, my naughty Ma&s;ter not excepted;&mdash;for I wi&s;h him to live, and repent of all his Wickedne&s;s to poor me.</P>
<P>O dear Heart! what a World do we live in !&mdash; I am now to take up my Pen again: But I am in a &s;ad Taking truly! Another puzzling Trial, to be &s;ure!</P>
<P>Here is <HI>John,</HI> as I &s;aid; and the poor Man came to me, with Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> who whi&s;per'd, that I would &s;ay nothing about the Shoes, for my <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, as &s;he &s;aid.

Oh Mrs. <HI>Pamela!</HI> &s;aid he; Oh Mrs. <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash; Well hone&s;t Fellow-&s;ervant, &s;aid I, I cannot help it at pre&s;ent! I am oblig'd to your Hone&s;ty and Kindne&s;s, to be &s;ure; and then he wept more. Said I, (for my Heart was ready to break to &s;ee his Grief; for it is a touching thing to &s;ee a Man cry) Tell me the wor&s;t! Is my Ma&s;ter coming? No, no, &s;aid he, and &s;obb'd. &mdash;Well, &s;aid I, is there any News of my poor Father and Mother? How do they do?&mdash; I hope, well, &s;aid he; I know nothing to the contrary; There is no Mi&s;hap, I hope, to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> or my Fellow-&s;ervants! No&mdash; &s;aid he, poor Man! with a long N&mdash;o, as if his Heart would bur&s;t. Well, thank God then! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The Man's a Fool, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> I think; what ado is here! why &s;ure thou'rt in Love, <HI>John.</HI> Do&s;t thou not &s;ee young Madam is well? What ails thee, Man? Nothing at all, &s;aid he; but I am &s;uch a Fool, as to cry for Joy to &s;ee good Mrs. <HI>Pamela:</HI> But I have a Letter for you.</P>
<P>I took it, and &s;aw it was from my Ma&s;ter; &s;o I put it in my Pocket. Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, you need not,
<PB N="148" REF="185">
I hope, &s;ee this. No, no, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee whom it comes from, well enough; or el&s;e, may-be, I mu&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>And here is one for you, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid he; but yours, &s;aid he to me, requires an An&s;wer, which I mu&s;t carry back early in the Morning, or to-night, if I can.</P>
<P>You have no more, <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> for Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> have you? No, &s;aid he, I have not; but every body's kind Love and Service.

<P>But he &s;ays enough of him&s;elf; and I can only &s;it down with this &s;ad Reflection, That Power and Riches never want Tools to promote their vile&s;t Ends, and that there is nothing &s;o hard to be known as the Heart of Man!&mdash;Yet I can but pity the poor Wretch, &s;ince he &s;eems to have &s;ome Remor&s;e, and I believe it be&s;t to keep his Wickedne&s;s &s;ecret, and, if it lies in my way, to encourage his Penitence; for I may po&s;&s;ibly make &s;ome Di&s;coveries by it.</P>
<P>One thing I &s;hould mention in this Place; he brought down, in a Portmanteau, all the Cloaths and Things my Lady and Ma&s;ter had given me, and more|over two Velvet Hoods, and a Velvet Scarf, that u&s;ed to be worn by my Lady; but I have no Comfort in them, or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> had the Portmanteau brought into my Clo&s;er, and &s;he &s;hew'd me what was in it; but then lock'd it up, and &s;aid, &s;he would let me have what I would out of it, when I asked; but if I had the Key, it might make me want to go abroad, may-be; and &s;o the in&s;olent Woman put it in her Pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="192">I gave my&s;elf over to &s;ad Reflexions upon this &s;trange and &s;urprizing Di&s;covery of <HI>John</HI>'s, and wept much for him, and for my&s;elf too; and now I &s;ee, as he &s;ays, my Ruin has been &s;o long a hatching, that I can make no Doubt what my Ma&s;ter's <HI>honourable</HI> Pro|fe&s;&s;ions will end in.

<P>I can but wonder what the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as they are called, can think of them&s;elves for the&s;e vile Doings? <HI>John</HI> had <HI>&s;ome</HI> Inducement; for he hoped to plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter, who rewarded him, and was bountiful to him; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid, bad as &s;he is, for this &s;ame odious Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> But what Inducement has my <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> for taking &s;o much Pains to do the Devil's Work?&mdash;If he loves me, as 'tis fal&s;ly called, mu&s;t he therefore lay Traps for me, to ruin me, and to make me as bad as him&s;elf? I cannot imagine what Good the Undoing of &s;uch a poor Creature as I can procure him! &mdash;To be &s;ure, I am a very worthle&s;s Body. People indeed &s;ay I am hand&s;ome; but if I was &s;o, &s;hould not a Gentleman prefer an hone&s;t Servant to a guilty Har|lot?&mdash;And mu&s;t he be <HI>more</HI> earne&s;t to &s;educe me, be|cau&s;e I dread of all Things to be &s;educed, and would rather lo&s;e ray Life than my Hone&s;ty!</P>
<P>Well, the&s;e are &s;trange Things to me! I cannot account for them, for my Share; but &s;ure nobody will &s;ay, that the&s;e fine Gentlemen have any Tempter but their own wicked Wills!&mdash;This naughty Ma&s;ter could run away from me, when he thought none but

his Servants &s;hould know his ba&s;e Attempts, in that &s;ad Clo&s;et Affair; but is it not &s;trange, that he &s;hould not be afraid of the All-&s;eeing Eye, from which even that black poi&s;onous Heart of his, and its mo&s;t &s;ecret Motions, could not be hid? &mdash; But what avail me the&s;e &s;orrowful Reflections?

<HEAD><HI>TUESDAY</HI> and <HI>WEDNESDAY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have been hinder'd, by this wicked Woman's watching me too clo&s;e, from writing on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>; and &s;o I will put both the&s;e Days together. I have been a little Turn with her, for an Airing, in the Chariot, and walked &s;everal times in the Garden; but have always her at my Heels.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> came to &s;ee us, and look a Walk with us once; and while her Back was ju&s;t turn'd, (encou|rag'd by the Hint he had before given me) I &s;aid, Sir, I &s;ee two Tiles upon that Par&s;ley-bed; cannot one cover them with Mould, with a Note between them, on Occa&s;ion?&mdash;A good Hint, &s;aid he; let that Sun|flower by the Back-door of the Garden be the Place; I have a Key to that; for it is my neare&s;t way to the Town.</P>
<P>So I was forced to begin. O what Inventions will Nece&s;&s;ity be the Parent of! I hugg'd my&s;elf with the Thought; and &s;he coming to us, he &s;aid, as if he was continuing the Di&s;cour&s;e we were in; No, not extraordinary plea&s;ant. What's that? what's that? &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI>&mdash;Only, &s;aid he, the Town, I'm &s;aying, is not very plea&s;ant. No, indeed, &s;aid &s;he, 'tis not; 'tis a poor Town, to my thinking. Are there any Gentry in it? &s;aid I. And &s;o we chat|ted
<PB N="157" REF="194">
on about the Town, to deceive her. But my Deceit intended no Hurt to any body.</P>
<P>We then talked of the Garden, how large and plea&s;ant, and the like; and &s;at down on the turfted Slope of the fine Fi&s;h-pond, to &s;ee the Fi&s;hes play upon the Surface of the Water; and &s;he &s;aid, I &s;hould angle if I would.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, you'd be &s;o kind to fetch me a Rod and Baits. Pretty Mi&s;tre&s;s! &s;aid &s;he&mdash;I know better than that, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, at this time.&mdash;I mean no Harm, &s;aid I, indeed. Let me tell you, &s;aid &s;he, I know no one that has their Thoughts more about them than you. A body ought to look to it, where you are. But we'll angle a little to-morrow. Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> who is much afraid of her, turn'd the Di&s;|cour&s;e to a general Subject. I &s;aunter'd in, and left them to talk by them&s;elves; but he went away to Town, and &s;he was &s;oon after me.</P>
<P>I had got to my Pen and Ink; and I &s;aid, I want &s;ome Paper (putting what I was about in my Bo|&s;om): You know I have written two Letters, and &s;ent them by <HI>John</HI> (O how his Name, poor guilty Fel|low, grieves me!). Well, &s;aid &s;he, you have &s;ome left; one Sheet did for tho&s;e two Letters. Yes, &s;aid I; but I u&s;ed half another for a Wrapper, you know; and &s;ee how I have &s;cribbled the other Half; and &s;o I &s;hewed her a Parcel of broken Scraps of Ver&s;es, which I had try'd to recollect, and which I had written purpo&s;ely that &s;he might &s;ee, and think me u&s;ually employ'd to &s;uch idle Purpo&s;es. Ay, &s;aid &s;he, &s;o you have; well, I'll give you two Sheets more; but let me &s;ee how you di&s;po&s;e of them, either written or blank. Well, thought I, I hope &s;till, <HI>Argus,</HI> to be too hard for thee. Now <HI>Argus,</HI> the Poets &s;ay, had an hundred Eyes, and was made to watch with them all, as &s;he does.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="195">She brought me the Paper, and &s;aid, Now, Ma|dam, let me &s;ee you write &s;omething. I will, &s;aid I; and took the Pen, and wrote,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wi&s;h Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> would be as good to me, as I would be to her, if I had it in my Power!"</Q>
&mdash;That's pretty now! &s;aid &s;he; well, I hope I am; but what then?
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why then (<HI>wrote I</HI>) &s;he would do me the Favour to let me know, what I have done to be made her Pri&s;oner; and what &s;he thinks is to become of me."</Q>
Well, and what then? &s;aid &s;he.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why then, of Con&s;equence, (<HI>&s;cribbled I</HI>) &s;he would let me &s;ee her In&s;tructions, that I may know far to blame her, or acquit her."</Q></P>
<P>Thus I fooled on, to &s;hew her my Fondne&s;s for &s;cribbling; for I had no Expectation of any Good from her; that &s;o &s;he might &s;uppo&s;e I employ'd my|&s;elf, as I &s;aid, to no better Purpo&s;e at other Times: For &s;he will have it, that I am upon the &s;ome Plot, I am &s;o &s;ilent, and love &s;o much to be my&s;elf. &mdash; She would have me write on a little further. No, &s;aid I, you have not an&s;wer'd me. Why, &s;aid &s;he, what can you doubt, when my Ma&s;ter him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures you of his Honour? Ay, &s;aid I; but lay your Hand to your Heart, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> and tell me, if you your|&s;elf believe him. Yes, &s;aid &s;he, to be &s;ure I do. But, &s;aid I, what do <HI>you</HI> call Honour?&mdash;Why, &s;aid &s;he, what does <HI>he</HI> call Honour, think you?&mdash;Ruin! Shame! Di&s;grace! &s;aid I, I fear.&mdash;Pho, pho! &s;aid &s;he; if you have any Doubt about it, he can be&s;t ex|plain his own Meaning:&mdash;I'll &s;end him Word to come to &s;atisfy you, if you will.&mdash;Horrid Creature! &s;aid I, all in a Fright&mdash;Can'&s;t thou not &s;tab me to the Heart! I'd rather thou would&s;t, than &s;ay &s;uch another Word! &mdash;But I hope there is no Thought of his coming.</P>
<P>She had the Wickedne&s;s to &s;ay. No, no; he don't intend to come, as I know of: &mdash; But if I was he,
<PB N="159" REF="196">
I would not be long away.&mdash;What means the Wo|man? &s;aid I.&mdash;Mean! &s;aid &s;he (turning it off); why I mean, I would come, if I was he, and put an End to all your Fears&mdash;by making you as happy as you wi&s;h. 'Tis out of his Power, &s;aid I, to make <HI>me</HI> happy, great and rich as he is! but by leaving me in|nocent, and giving me Liberty to go to my dear Fa|ther and Mother.</P>
<P>She went away &s;oon after, and I ended my Letter, in Hopes to have an Opportunity to lay it in the ap|pointed Place. So I went to her, and &s;aid; I &s;up|po&s;e, as it is not dark, I may take another Turn in the Garden. 'Tis too late, &s;aid &s;he; but if you will go, don't &s;tay; and, <HI>Nan,</HI> &s;ee and attend Madam, as &s;he called me.</P>
<P>So I went towards the Pond, the Wench follow|ing me, and dropt purpo&s;ely my Hu&s;&s;ey: And when I came near the Tiles, I &s;aid, Mrs. <HI>Ann,</HI> I have dropt my Hu&s;&s;ey; be &s;o kind as to look for it: I had it by the Pond-&s;ide. The Wench went to look, and I &s;lipt the Note between the Tiles, and cover'd them as quick as I could with the light Mould, quite unperceiv'd; and the Maid finding the Hu&s;&s;ey, I took it, and &s;aunter'd in again, and met Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> coming to &s;ee after me. What I wrote was this:

<HEAD>THURSDAY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS completes a fatal Week &s;ince my &s;etting out, as I hoped, to &s;ee you, my dear Father and Mother. O how different were my Hopes then, from what they are now! Yet who knows what the&s;e happy Tiles may produce!</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tell you, fir&s;t, how I have been beaten by Mrs. <HI>Jewkes!</HI> 'Tis very true!&mdash;And thus it came about:</P>
<P>My Impatience was great to walk in the Garden, to &s;ee if any thing had offer'd, an&s;werable to my Hopes. But this wicked Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> would not let me go without her; and &s;he &s;aid &s;he was not at Lei&s;ure. We had a great many Words about it; for I &s;aid, it was very hard I could not be tru&s;ted to walk by my&s;elf in the Garden for a little Air; but mu&s;t be dogg'd and watch'd wor&s;e than a Thief.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="199">She &s;till pleaded her In&s;tructions, and &s;aid &s;he was not to tru&s;t me out of her Sight: And you had better, &s;aid &s;he, be ea&s;y and contented, I a&s;&s;ure you; for I have wor&s;e Orders than you have yet found. I re|member, &s;aid &s;he, your asking Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> if, there were any Gentry in the Neighbourhood: This makes me &s;u&s;pect you want to get away to them, to tell your &s;ad di&s;mal Story, as you call it.</P>
<P>My Heart was at my Mouth; for I fear'd by that Hint, &s;he had &s;een my Letter under the Tiles: O how unea&s;y I was! At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, Well, &s;ince you take &s;o on, you may take a Turn, and I will be with you in a Minute.</P>
<P>I went out; and when I was out of Sight of her Window, I &s;peeded towards the hopeful Place, but was &s;oon forced to &s;lacken my Pace, by her odious Voice; Hey-day, why &s;o nimble, and whither &s;o fa&s;t? &s;aid &s;he: What! are you upon a Wager? I &s;topt for her, till her pur&s;y Sides were waddled up to me; and &s;he held by my Arm, half out of Breath: So I was forced to pa&s;s by the dear Place, without daring to look at it.</P>
<P>The Gardener was at Work a little further, and &s;o we looked upon him, and I began to talk about his Art; but &s;he &s;aid &s;oftly. My In&s;tructions are, not to let you be &s;o familiar with the Servants. Why, &s;aid I, are you afraid I &s;hould confederate with them to commit a Robbery upon my Ma&s;ter? May-be I am, &s;aid the odious Wretch; for to rob him of your&s;elf, would be the wor&s;t that could happen to him, in his Opinion.</P>
<P>And pray, &s;aid I, walking on, how came I to be his Property? What Right has he in me, but &s;uch as a Thief may plead to &s;tolen Goods?&mdash;Why, was ever the like heard, &s;ays &s;he!&mdash;This is downright Rebellion, I prote&s;t!&mdash;Well, well, Lambkin, (which
<PB N="163" REF="200">
the Fooli&s;h often calls me) if I was m his Place, he &s;hould not have his Property in you long que&s;tion|able. Why, what would you do, &s;aid I, if you were he?&mdash;Not. &s;tand &s;hill-I, &s;hall-I, as he does; but put you and him&s;elf both out of your Pain.&mdash;Why, <HI>Je|zebel,</HI> &s;aid I, (I could not help it) would you ruin me by Force?&mdash;Upon this &s;he gave me a deadly Slap upon my Shoulder: Take that, &s;aid &s;he; whom do you call <HI>Jezebel?</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;urpris'd, (for you never beat me, my dear Father and Mother, in your Lives) that I was as one thunder-&s;truck; and looked round, as if I wanted &s;omebody to help me; but, alas! I had no|body; and &s;aid, at la&s;t, rubbing my Shoulder, Is this al&s;o in your In&s;tructions?&mdash;Alas! for me! am I to be beaten too? And &s;o I fell a-crying, and threw my&s;elf upon the Gra&s;s-walk we were upon.&mdash;Said &s;he, in a great Pet, I won't be call'd &s;uch Names, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. Marry come up! I &s;ee you have a Spirit: You mu&s;t and &s;hall be kept under. I'll ma|nage &s;uch little provoking Things as you, I warrant ye! Come, come, we'll go in Doors, and I'll lock you up, and you &s;hall have no Shoes, nor any thing el&s;e, if this is to be the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I did not know what to do. This was a cruel thing to me, and I blam'd my&s;elf for my free Speech; for now I had given her &s;ome Pretence; and Oh! thought I, here I have, by my Malpertne&s;s, ruin'd the only Project I had left.</P>
<P>The Gardener &s;aw this Scene; but &s;he called to him, Well, <HI>Jacob,</HI> what do you &s;tare at? Pray mind what you're upon. And away he walk'd, to another Quarter, out of Sight.</P>
<P>Well, thought I, I mu&s;t put on the Di&s;&s;embler a little, I &s;ee. She took my Hand roughly; Come, get up, &s;aid &s;he, and come in Doors.&mdash;I'll <HI>Jezebel</HI> you, I warrant ye! &mdash; Why, dear Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid
<PB N="164" REF="201">
I&mdash;None of your Dears and your Coaxing? &s;aid &s;he; why not <HI>Jezebel</HI> again?&mdash;She was in a fearful Pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;aw, and I was out of my Wits. Thought I, I have often heard Women blam'd for their Tongues; I wi&s;h mine had been &s;horter. But I can't go in, &s;aid I, indeed I can't!&mdash;Why, &s;aid &s;he, can't you? I'll warrant I can take &s;uch a thin Body as you are, under my Arm, and carry you in, if you won't walk. You don't know my Strength.&mdash;Yes, but I do, &s;aid I, too well; and will you not u&s;e me wor&s;e when I come in?&mdash;So I aro&s;e, and &s;he mutter'd to her&s;elf all the way, She to be a <HI>Jezebel</HI> with me, that had u&s;ed me &s;o well! and &s;uch-like.</P>
<P>When I came near the Hou&s;e, I &s;aid, &s;itting down upon a Settle-bench, Well, I will <HI>not</HI> go in, till you &s;ay, you will forgive me, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI>&mdash;If you will forgive my calling you that Name, I will forgive your beating me.&mdash;She &s;at down by me, and &s;eem'd in a great Pucker, and &s;aid, Well, come, I will forgive you for this time; and &s;o ki&s;&s;ed me, as a Mark of Reconciliation.&mdash;But pray, &s;aid I, tell me where I am to walk, and go, and give me what Liberty you can; and when I know the mo&s;t you can favour me with, you &s;hall &s;ee I will be as content as I can, and not ask you for more.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid &s;he, this is &s;omething like: I wi&s;h I could give you all the Liberty you de&s;ire; for you mu&s;t think it is no Plea&s;ure to me to tie you to my Petticoat, as it were, and not to let you &s;tir with|out me&mdash; But People that will do their Duties, mu&s;t have &s;ome Trouble; and what I do, is to &s;erve as good a Ma&s;ter, to be &s;ure, as lives&mdash;Yes, &s;aid I, to every body but me!&mdash;He loves you too well, to be &s;ure, reply'd &s;he, and that's the Rea&s;on; &s;o you ought to bear it. I &s;ay, <HI>love,</HI> &s;aid I! Come, &s;aid &s;he, don't let the Wench &s;ee you have been crying, nor tell her any Tales; for you won't tell them fairly, I

am &s;ure; and I'll &s;end her, and you &s;hall take ano|ther Walk in the Garden, if you will: May-be, &s;aid &s;he, it will get you a Stomach to your Dinner; for you don't eat enough to keep Life and Soul to|gether. You are Beauty to the Bone, added the &s;trange Wretch, or you could not look &s;o well as you do, with &s;o little Stomach, &s;o little Re&s;t, and &s;o much pining and whining for nothing at all. Well, thought I, &s;ay what thou wilt, &s;o I can be rid of thy bad Tongue and Company: And I hop'd to find &s;ome Opportunity now, to come at my Sun-flower. But I walked the other way, to take that in my Return, to avoid Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>I forced my Di&s;cour&s;e to the Wench; but it was all upon general things; for I find &s;he is asked after every thing I &s;ay and do. When I came near the Place, as I had been devi&s;ing, I &s;aid, Pray, &s;tep to the Gardener, and ask him to gather a Sallad for me to Dinner. She called out, <HI>Jacob!</HI>&mdash;Said I, he can't hear you &s;o far off; and pray tell him, I &s;hould like a Cucumber too, if he has one. When &s;he had &s;tept about a Bow-&s;hot from me, I popt down, and whipt my Fingers under the upper Tile, and pulled out a Letter, without Direction, and thru&s;t it in my Bo&s;om, trembling for Joy. She was with me before I could well &s;ecure it; and I was in &s;uch a taking, that I feared I &s;hould di&s;cover my&s;elf. You &s;eem frighted, Ma|dam, &s;aid &s;he: Why, &s;aid I, with a lucky Thought, (alas! your poor Daughter will make an Intriguer by-and-by; but I hope an innocent one!) I &s;toop'd to &s;mell at the Sun-flower, and a great na&s;ty Worm ran into, the Ground, that &s;tartled me; for I don't love Worms. Said &s;he, Sun-flowers don't &s;mell. So I find, reply'd I. And &s;o we walked in; and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> &s;aid, Well, you have made ha&s;te in.&mdash;You &s;hall go another time.</P>

<P>I had time but ju&s;t to tran&s;cribe this, before I was called to Dinner; and I put that for Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> with a Wafer in it, in my Bo&s;om, to get an Oppor|tunity to lay it in the dear Place.</P>
<P>O good Sirs! Of all the Flowers in the Garden, the Sun-flower, &s;ure, is the lovelie&s;t!&mdash;It is a pro|pitious one to me! How nobly my Plot &s;ucceeds!

O Mrs. <HI>Jewkes!</HI> &s;aid I, I was thinking this poor Carp was the unhappy <HI>Pamela.</HI> I was likening you and my&s;elf to my naughty Ma&s;ter.

<P>Lord ble&s;s thee! &s;aid &s;he, what a Thought is there! &mdash;Well, &s;aid I, I can angle no more. I'll try <HI>my</HI> Fortune, &s;aid &s;he, and took the Rod. Well, &s;aid I, I will plant Life then, if I can, while you are de|&s;troying it.

down, and hop'd &s;he us'd me kindly, and the like. And I &s;aid, Now, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> let me have your Advice as to this. Why then, &s;aid &s;he, I will give it you freely. E'en &s;end to him to come down. It will highly oblige him, and I dare &s;ay you'll fare the better for it.

<P>Well, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, I &s;hall not at this time di&s;pute with you about the Words <HI>Ruin</HI> or <HI>honour|able</HI>; for I find, we have quite different Notions of both: But now I will &s;peak plainer than ever I did. Do you think he intends to make Propo&s;als to me, as to a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, or kept Slave rather, or do you not?&mdash;Why, Lambkin, &s;aid &s;he, what do&s;t thou think thy&s;elf?&mdash;I fear, &s;aid I, he does. Well, &s;aid &s;he, but if he does, (for I know nothing of the Matter, I a&s;&s;ure you) you may have your own Terms&mdash; I &s;ee that; for you may do any thing with him.</P>
<P>I could not bear this to be &s;poken, tho' it was all I fear'd of a longtime; and began to exclaim mo&s;t &s;adly. Nay, &s;aid &s;he, he may marry you, as far as I know.&mdash;No, no, &s;aid I, that cannot be&mdash;I neither de&s;ire nor expect it. His Condition don't permit me to have &s;uch a Thought, and that, and the whole Series of his Conduct, convinces me of the con|trary; and you would have me invite him to come down, would you? Is not this to invite my Ruin?</P>
<P>'Tis what <HI>I</HI> would do, &s;aid &s;he, in your Place; and if it was to be as you <HI>think,</HI> I &s;hould rather be out of my Pain, than live in continual Frights and Apprehen&s;ion as you do. No, reply'd I, an <HI>Hour</HI> of Innocence is worth an <HI>Age</HI> of Guilt; and were my

<P>Why, may-be, &s;aid &s;he, as he loves you &s;o well, you may prevail upon him by your Prayers and Tears; and for that Rea&s;on, I &s;hould think, you'd better let him come down. Well, &s;aid I, I will write him a Letter, becau&s;e he expects an An&s;wer, or may-be he will make that a Pretence to come down. How can it go?</P>
<P>I'll take care of that, &s;aid &s;he; it is in my In|&s;tructions&mdash;Ay, thought I, &s;o I doubt, by the Hint Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> gave me, about the Po&s;t-hou&s;e.</P>

What &s;hould <HI>I</HI> do with Beans? &s;aid &s;he&mdash; and &s;adly &s;car'd me; for &s;he whi&s;per'd me, I am afraid of &s;ome Fetch! you don't u&s;e to &s;end of &s;uch &s;imple Errands.&mdash; What Fetch? &s;aid I; it is hard I can neither &s;tir, nor &s;peak, but I mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pected.&mdash;Why, &s;aid &s;he, my Ma&s;ter writes, that I mu&s;t have all my Eyes about me; for, tho' you are as innocent as a Dove, yet you're as cunning as a Serpent. But I'll forgive you, if you cheat me.</P>

<P>I Write now with a little more Liking, tho' le&s;s Opportunity, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> has got a large Parcel of my Papers &s;afe, in his Hands, to &s;end them to you, as he has Opportunity; &s;o I am not quite u&s;ele&s;ly employ'd; and I am deliver'd, be&s;ides, from the Fear of their being found, if I &s;hould be &s;earch'd, or di&s;cover'd. I have been permitted to take an Airing five or &s;ix Miles, with Mrs. <HI>Jewkes:</HI> But, tho' I know not the Rea&s;on, &s;he watches me more clo&s;ely than ever; &s;o that we have di&s;continued, by Con&s;ent, for the&s;e three Days, the Sun-flower Corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>The poor Cook-maid has had a bad Mi&s;chance; for &s;he has been hurt much by a Bull in the Pa&s;ture, by the Side of the Garden, not far from the Back|door. Now this Pa&s;ture I am to cro&s;s, which is about half a Mile, and then is a Common, and near that a private Hor&s;e-road, where I hope to find an Op|portunity for e&s;caping, as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> can get me a Hor&s;e, and has made all ready for me: For he has got me the Key, which he put under the Mould, ju&s;t by the Door, as he found an Opportu|nity to hint to me.</P>
<P>He ju&s;t now has &s;ignify'd, that the Gentleman is dead, who&s;e Living he has had Hope of, and he came pretendedly to tell Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> of it; and &s;o could &s;peak this to her, before me. She wi&s;h'd him

<P>I knew this mu&s;t be a Fetch of hers, becau&s;e in|&s;tead of being troubled for me, as &s;he pretended, &s;he watched me clo&s;er, and him too: and &s;o I &s;aid, There is not the Man living that I de&s;ire to marry.

Well, but, &s;aid &s;he, I have been thinking very &s;eriou&s;ly, that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> would make you a good Hu&s;hand; and as he will owe all his Fortune to my Ma&s;ter, he will be very glad, to be &s;ure, to be oblig'd to him for a Wife of his chu&s;ing: E&s;pecially, &s;aid &s;he, &s;uch a pretty one, and one &s;o ingenious and genteelly educated.</P>
<P>This gave me a Doubt, whether &s;he knew of my Ma&s;ter's Intimation of that &s;ort formerly; and I a&s;ked her, if &s;he had Rea&s;on to furmi&s;e, that <HI>that</HI> was in View? No, &s;he &s;aid; it was only her own Thought; but it was very likely that my Ma&s;ter had either that in View, or &s;omething better for me. But, if I approv'd of it, &s;he would propo&s;e &s;uch a thing to her Ma&s;ter directly; and gave a dete&s;table Hint, that I might take Re&s;olutions upon it, of
<PB N="187" REF="224">
bringing &s;uch an Affair to Effect. I told her, I ab|horr'd her vile In&s;inuation; and as to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> I thought him a civil good &s;ort of Man; but as on one &s;ide, he was above me; &s;o on the other, of all Things, I did not love a Par&s;on.

<P>I will open his Letter by-and-by, and give you the Contents of it; for &s;he is up and down &s;o much, that I am afraid of her &s;urpri&s;ing me.</P>

I was glad of this, becau&s;e tho' in my pre&s;ent doubtful Situation, I &s;hould not have cho&s;en it, yet I would have encourag'd her Propo&s;al, to be able to judge by her being in Earne&s;t or otherwi&s;e, whether one might depend upon the re&s;t.

<P>After all, I hope the be&s;t; but if this &s;hould turn out to be a Plot, I fear nothing but a Miracle can &s;ave me. But &s;ure, the Heart of Man is not capable of &s;uch black Deceit.

her, as I could do very &s;afely, that there was not a Man on Earth I wi&s;h'd to have; and, as to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> he might do better by far, and I had pro|po&s;ed &s;o much Happine&s;s in living with my poor Father and Mother, that I could not think of any Scheme of Life, with Plea&s;ure, till I had try'd that.

And what a Figure he mu&s;t cut in his tatter'd Band and Ca&s;&s;ock, and without Hat and Wig, when he got Home. I warrant, &s;aid &s;he, he was in a &s;weet Pickle!&mdash;I &s;aid, I thought it was very barbarous to laugh at &s;uch a Misfortune: But &s;he &s;aid, As he was &s;afe, &s;he laughed; otherwi&s;e &s;he &s;hould have been &s;orry: And &s;he was glad to &s;ee me &s;o concern'd for him&mdash;It look'd <HI>promi&s;ing,</HI> &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I heeded not her Reflection; but as I have been u&s;ed to Cau&s;es for Mi&s;tru&s;ts, I cannot help &s;aying, that I don't like this thing: And their taking his Letters mo&s;t alarms me.&mdash;How happy it was, they mi&s;s'd my Pacquet! I know not what to think of it!&mdash;But why &s;hould I let every Accident break my Peace? But yet it <HI>will</HI> do &s;o while I &s;tay here.</P>

And &s;he is gone without me.</P>
<P>I have &s;trange Temptations to get away in her Ab&s;ence, for all the&s;e fine Appearances. 'Tis &s;ad to have no body to advi&s;e with!&mdash;I know not what to do. But, alas for me! I have no Money, if I &s;hould, to buy any body's Civilities, or to pay for
<PB N="199" REF="236">
Nece&s;&s;aries or Lodging. But I'll go into the Gar|den, and re&s;olve afterwards.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been in the Garden, and to the Back-door; and there I &s;tood, my Heart up at my Mouth. I could not &s;ee I was watch'd; &s;o this looks well. But if any thing &s;hould go bad afterwards, I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf, for not taking this Opportunity. Well, I will go down again, and &s;ee if all is clear, and how it looks out at the Back-door in the Pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, there is Witchcraft in this Hou&s;e; and I believe <HI>Lucifer</HI> is bribed, as well as all about me, and is got into the Shape of that na&s;ty grim Bull, to watch me!&mdash;For I have been down again; and ventur'd to open the Door, and went out about a Bow-&s;hoot into the Pa&s;ture; but there &s;tood that horrid Bull, &s;taring me full in the Face, with fiery &s;aucer Eyes, as I thought. So, I got in again; for fear he &s;hould come at me.

But yet, what could I do without Money or a Friend? &mdash;O this wicked Woman! to trick me &s;o!

<P>But after all, if my Ma&s;ter &s;hould mean <HI>well,</HI> he can't be angry at my Fears, if I <HI>&s;hould</HI> e&s;cape; and no body can blame me; and I can more ea&s;ily be induced with you, when all my Apprehen&s;ions are over, to con&s;ider his Propo&s;al of Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> than I could here; and he pretends as you have read in his Letter, he will leave me at my Choice: Why then &s;hould I be afraid? I will go down again, I think!

<P>Well, I have ju&s;t now a &s;ort of &s;trange Per|&s;ua&s;ion upon me, that I ought to try to get away, and leave the I&s;&s;ue to Providence. So, once more?&mdash; I'll &s;ee, at lea&s;t, if this Bull be &s;till there!</P>
<P>Alack-a-day! what a Fate is this! I have not the Courage to go, neither can I think to &s;tay. But I mu&s;t re&s;olve. The Gardner was in Sight la&s;t time! &s;o made me come up again. But I'll contrive to &s;end him out of the way, if I can!&mdash;For if I never &s;hould have &s;uch another Opportunity, I could not forgive my&s;elf. Once more I'll venture, God direct my Foot&s;teps, and make &s;mooth my Path and my Way to Safety!</P>
<P>Well, here I am, come back again! frighted like a Fool, out of all my Purpo&s;es! O how terrible every thing appears to me! I had got twice as far again, as I was before, out of the Back door; and I looked, and &s;aw the Bull, as I thought, between me and the Door; and another Bull coming towards me the other way: Well, thought I, here is double Witchcraft, to be &s;ure! Here is the Spirit of my
<PB N="201" REF="240">
Ma&s;ter in one Bull; and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s in the other: and now I am gone, to be &s;ure! O help! cry'd I, like a Fool, and run back to the Door, as &s;wift as if I flew. When I had got the Door in my Hand, I ventur'd to look back, to &s;ee if the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Bulls were coming; and I &s;aw they were only two poor Cows, a grazing in di&s;tant Places, that my Fears had made all this Rout about. But as eve|ry thing is &s;o frightful to me, I find I am not fit to think of my E&s;cape: For I &s;hall be as much frighted at the fir&s;t &s;trange Man that I meet with. And I am per&s;uaded, that Fear brings one into more Dangers, than the Caution, that goes along with it, delivers one from.</P>
<P>I then locked the Door, and put the Key in my Pocket, and was in a &s;ad Quandary; but I was &s;oon determined; for the Maid <HI>Nan</HI> came in Sight, and asked, if any thing was the matter, that I was &s;o often up and down Stairs? God forgive me; but I had a &s;ad Lye at my Tongue's End: &s;aid I, Tho' Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is &s;ometimes a little hard upon me, yet I know not where I am without her: I go up, and I come down to walk about in the Garden: and not having her, know &s;carcely what to do with my|&s;elf. Ay, &s;aid the Idiot, &s;he is main good Com|pany, Madam; no wonder you mi&s;s her.</P>
<P>So here I am again; and here likely to be; for I have no Courage to help my&s;elf any-where el&s;e.

<P>SO, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is returned from her Vi&s;it: Well, &s;aid &s;he, I would have you &s;et your Heart at re&s;t; for Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> will do very well again. He is not half &s;o badly off as he fancy'd. O the&s;e Scholars, &s;aid &s;he, they have not the Hearts of Mice! He has only a few Scratches on his Face; which, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;uppo&s;e he got by grabbling among the Gravel, at the bottom of the Dam, to try to find a Hole in the Ground, to hide him&s;elf from the Robbers. His Shin and his Knee are hardly to be &s;een to all any thing. He &s;ays in his Letter, he was a fright|ful Spectacle: He might be &s;o indeed, when he fir&s;t came in a-doors; but he looks well enough now; and, only for a few Groans now-and-then, when he thinks of his Danger, I &s;ee nothing is the matter with him. So, Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I would have you be very ea&s;y about it. I am glad of it, &s;aid I, for all your Jokes, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, he talks of nothing but you; and when I told him, I would fain have per&s;uaded you to come with me, the Man was out of his Wits with his Gratitude to me: and &s;o has laid open all his Heart to me, and told me all that has pa&s;&s;ed, and was contriving between you two. This alarm'd me prodigiou&s;ly; and the rather, as I &s;aw, by two or three In&s;tances, that his hone&s;t Heart could keep nothing, believing every one as unde&s;igning as him&s;elf.
<PB N="203" REF="242">
I &s;aid, but yet with a heavy Heart, ah, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> this might have done with me, had he had any thing that he could have told you of. But you know well enough, that had we been di&s;|po&s;ed, we had no Opportunity for it, from your watchful Care and Circum&s;pection. No, &s;aid &s;he, that's very true, Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI>; not &s;o much as for that Declaration that he own'd before me, he had found Opportunity, for all my Watchfulne&s;s, to make you. Come, come, &s;aid &s;he, no more of the&s;e Shams with me! You have an excellent Head|piece for your Years; but may-be I am as cunning as you.&mdash;However &s;aid &s;he, all is well now; be|cau&s;e my <HI>Watchments</HI> are now over, by my Ma|&s;ter's Direction. How have you employ'd your&s;elf in my Ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>I was &s;o troubled at what might have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and her, that I could not hide it. And &s;he &s;aid, Well, Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;ince all Mat|ters are likely to be &s;o &s;oon and &s;o happily ended, let me advi&s;e you to be a little le&s;s concern'd at his Di&s;coveries: and make me your Confident, as <HI>he</HI> has done, and I &s;hall think you have &s;ome Favour for me, and Reliance upon me; and perhaps you might not repent it.</P>
<P>She was &s;o earne&s;t, that I mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;he did this to pump me; and I knew how, now, to account for her Kindne&s;s to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> in her Vi&s;it to him; which was only to get out of him what &s;he could. Why, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, is all this fi&s;hing about for &s;omething, where there is nothing, if there be an end of your <HI>Watchments,</HI> as you call them? Nothing, &s;aid &s;he, but Womani&s;h Curio&s;ity, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; for one is naturally led to find out Mat|ters, where there is &s;uch Privacy intended. Well, &s;aid I, pray let me know what he has &s;aid; and then I'll give you an An&s;wer to your Curio&s;ity. I don't

care, &s;aid &s;he, whether you do or not; for I have as much as I wanted from him; and I de&s;pair of getting out of you any thing you han't a mind I &s;hould know, my little cunning Dear. &mdash; Well, &s;aid I, let him have &s;aid what he would, I care not: for I am &s;ure he can &s;ay no Harm of me; and &s;o let us change the Talk.</P>
<P>I was the ea&s;ier indeed; becau&s;e, for all her Pumps, &s;he gave no Hints of the Key and the Door, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which had he communicated to her, &s;he would not have forborn giving me a Touch of. &mdash; And &s;o we gave up one another, as de&s;pairing to gain our Ends of each other. But I am &s;ure he mu&s;t have &s;aid more than he &s;hould. &mdash; And I am the more apprehen&s;ive all is not right, becau&s;e &s;he has now been actually, the&s;e two Hours, &s;hut up a writing; tho' &s;he pretended &s;he had given me up all her Stores of Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that I &s;hould write for her. I begin to wi&s;h I had ventur'd every thing, and gone off, when I might. O when will this State of Doubt and Unea&s;ine&s;s end!</P>
<P>She has ju&s;t been with me, and &s;ays &s;he &s;hall &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>; and he &s;hall carry a Letter of Thanks for me, if I will write it, for my Ma&s;ter's Favour to me. Indeed, &s;aid I, I have no Thanks to give, till I am with my Father and Mo|ther: And be&s;ides, I &s;ent a Letter, as you know, but have had no An&s;wer to it. She &s;aid, &s;he thought that his Letter to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> was &s;ufficient; and the lea&s;t I could do, was to thank him, if but in two Lines. No need of it, &s;aid I; for I don't intend to have Mr. <HI>Williams:</HI> What then is that Letter to me? Well, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee thou art quite unfathomable!</P>
<P>I don't like all this. O my fooli&s;h Fears of Bulls and Robbers!&mdash; For now all my Unea&s;ine&s;s begins to double upon me. O what has this uncautious

<HEAD>TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Williams</HI> has been here; but we have had no Opportunity to talk together: He &s;eem'd confounded at Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s Change of Temper, and Re&s;ervedne&s;s, after her kind Vi&s;it, and their Free|dom with one another, and much more at what I am going to tell you. He asked, if I would take a Turn in the Garden with Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> and him. No, &s;aid &s;he, I can't go. Said he, may not Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI> take a Walk? &mdash; No, &s;aid &s;he; I de&s;ire &s;he won't. Why, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid he? I am afraid I have &s;ome-how di&s;obliged you.

<P>So I left them both together, and retired to my Clo&s;et, to write a Letter for the Tiles; but having no Time for a Copy, I will give you the Sub&s;tance only.</P>
<P>I expo&s;tulated with him on his too great Openne&s;s and Ea&s;ine&s;s to fall into Mrs. <HI>Jewkes's</HI> Snares; told him my Apprehen&s;ions of foul Play; and gave briefly the Rea&s;ons which moved me: Begg'd to know what he had &s;aid; and intimated, that I thought there was the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to re&s;ume our Project of the E&s;cape by the Back-Door.

<HEAD>And now I am come to the Clo&s;e of <HI>WEDNES|DAY,</HI> the <HI>27</HI>th Day of my Di&s;tre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>POOR Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> is actually arre&s;ted, and carried away to <HI>Stamford.</HI> So there is an End of all my Hopes in him. Poor Gentleman! his Over-&s;ecurity and Openne&s;s, have ruin'd us both!

I fear I &s;hall &s;oon find it &s;o!</P>
<P>But one Stratagem I have ju&s;t invented, tho' a very di&s;couraging one to think of; becau&s;e I have neither Friends nor Money, nor know one Step of the Way, if I was out of the Hou&s;e. But let Bulls, and Bears, and Lions, and Tygers, and, what is wor&s;e, fal&s;e, treacherous, deceitful Men, &s;tand in my Way, I cannot be in more Danger than I am; and I depend nothing upon his three Weeks: For how do I know, now be is in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, and has already begun his Vengeance on poor Mr. <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> that he will not change his Mind, and come down to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> before he goes to <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P>My Stratagem is this; I will endeavour to get Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> to go to-bed without me, as &s;he often does, while I &s;it lock'd up in my Clo&s;et; and as &s;he &s;leeps very &s;ound in her fir&s;t Sleep, of which &s;he never fails to give Notice by &s;noring, if I can but then get out between the two Ears of the Window, (for you know, I am very &s;lender, and I find I can get my Head thro'; then I can drop upon the Leads under|neath,
<PB N="223" REF="262">
which are little more than my Height, and which Leads are over a little Summer-parlour, that juts out towards the Garden, and as I am light, I can ea&s;ily drop from them; for they are not high from the Ground: Then I &s;hall get into the Garden; and then, as I have the Key of the Back-door, I will get out. But I have another Piece of Cunning &s;till; good Heaven, &s;ucceed to me my dangerous, but innocent Devices! &mdash; I have read of a great Captain, who being in Danger, leap'd over-board, into the Sea; and his Enemies &s;hooting at him with Bows and Arrows; he got off his upper Garment, and &s;wam away, while they &s;tuck that full of their Darts and Arrows; and he e&s;caped, and triumphed over them all. So what will I do, but &s;trip off my upper Petticoat, and throw it into the Pond, with my Neck-handkerchief; for, to be &s;ure, when they mi&s;s me, they will go to the Pond fir&s;t, think|ing I have drowned my&s;elf; and &s;o, when they &s;ee &s;ome of my Cloaths floating there, they will be all employ'd in dragging the Pond, which is a very large one: and as I &s;hall not, perhaps, be mi&s;s'd till the Morning, this will give me Opportunity to get a great way off; and I am &s;ure I will run for it when I am out. And &s;o I tru&s;t, that Providence will di|rect my Steps to &s;ome good Place of Safety, and make <HI>&s;ome</HI> worthy Body my Friend; for &s;ure, if I &s;uffer ever &s;o, I cannot be in more Danger, nor in wor&s;e Hands, than where I am; and with &s;uch avow'd bad De&s;igns.</P>
<P>O my dear Parents! don't be frighted when you come to read this!&mdash;But all will be over before you can &s;ee it; and &s;o God direct me for the be&s;t. My Writings, for fear I &s;hould not e&s;cape, I will bury in the Garden; for, to be &s;ure, I &s;hall be &s;earch'd, and u&s;ed dreadfully, if I can't get off. And

So, being now on the Ground, I hid my Papers under a Ro&s;e-bu&s;h, and cover'd them over with Mould, and there they &s;till lie, as I hope. Then I hy'd away to the Pond: The Clock &s;truck Twelve, ju&s;t as I got out; and it was a dark mi&s;ty Night, and coldi&s;h; but I felt none then.</P>
<P>When I came to the Pond-&s;ide, I flung in my Upper-coat, as I had de&s;ign'd, and my Neck|handkerchief, and a round ear'd Cap, with a Knot; and then with great Speed ran to the Door, and took the Key out of my Pocket, my poor Heart beating all the Time again&s;t my Bo&s;om, as if it would have forc'd its way thro' it: And beat it well might! For I then, too late, found, that I was mo&s;t mi&s;erably di&s;ap|pointed; for the wicked Woman had taken off that Lock, and put another on; &s;o that my Key would not open it.

O then how my Heart &s;unk!&mdash;I dropt down with Grief and Confu&s;ion, unable to &s;tir or &s;upport my&s;elf for a while. But my Fears awakening my Re&s;olution, and knowing that my Attempt would be as terrible for me, as any other Danger I could then encounter, I clamber'd up upon the Ledges of the Door, and upon the Lock, which was a great wooden one; and reached the Top of the Door with my Hands; then, little thinking I could climb &s;o well, I made &s;hift to lay hold on the Top of the Wall with my Hands; but, alas for me! nothing but ill Luck! &mdash; no E&s;cape for poor <HI>Pamela!</HI> The Wall being old, the Bricks I held by, gave way, ju&s;t as I was taking a Spring to get up, and down came I, and received &s;uch a Blow upon my Head, with one of the Bricks, that it quite &s;tunn'd me; and I broke my Shins and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ancle be&s;ides, and beat off the Heel of one of my Shoes.</P>

<P>And without helping me, &s;he run away to the Pond, and brought all the Crew to the Wood-hou&s;e. &mdash;The wicked Woman, as &s;he entered, &s;aid, Where is &s;he? &mdash; Plague of her Spells, and her Witch|crafts!
<PB N="235" REF="274">
She &s;hall dearly repent of this Trick, if my Name be <HI>Jewkes</HI>; and coming to me, took hold of my Arm, &s;o roughly, and gave me &s;uch a Pull, as made me &s;queal out, (my Shoulder being bruis'd on that Side) and drew me on my Face.

<P>I was &s;o weak, when I had got up Stairs, that I fainted away, with Dejection, Pain and Fatigue; and they undre&s;s'd me, and got me to Bed, and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> order'd <HI>Nan</HI> to bathe my Shoulder, and Arm, and Ancle, with &s;ome old Rum warm'd; and they cut the Hair a little from the back Part of my Head, and wa&s;h'd that; for it was clotted with Blood, from

a pretty long, but not deep Ga&s;h; and put a Family Plai&s;ter upon it; for if this Woman has any good Quality, it is, it &s;eems, in a Readine&s;s and Skill to manage in Ca&s;es, where &s;udden Misfortunes happen in a Family.</P>
<P>After this, I fell into a pretty &s;ound and refre&s;h|ing Sleep, and lay till Twelve o'Clock, tolerably ea&s;y, con&s;idering I was very feveri&s;h and agui&s;hly in|clin'd; and &s;he took a deal of Care to fit me to undergo more Trials, which I had hop'd would have been more happily ended: But Providence did not &s;ee fit.</P>
<P>She would make me ri&s;e about Twelve; but I was &s;o weak, I could only fit up till the Bed was made, and went into it again; and was, as they &s;aid, delirious &s;ome Part of the Afternoon.

But fir&s;t &s;he made me tell her the whole Story of my Enterprize; which I did very faithfully, knowing now that no|thing could &s;tand me in any &s;tead, or contribute to my Safety and E&s;cape: And &s;he &s;eem'd full of Wonder at my Re&s;olution and Venture&s;omene&s;s, but told me frankly, that I &s;hould have found a hard Matter to get quite off; for, that &s;he was provided with a War|rant from my Ma&s;ter, (who is a Ju&s;tice of Peace in this County, as well as the other) to get me appre|hended, if I <HI>had</HI> got away, on Su&s;picion of wrong|ing him, let me have been where I would.</P>
<P>O how deep-laid are the Mi&s;chiefs de&s;igned to fall on my devoted Head!&mdash;Surely, &s;urely, I cannot be

What is the Matter, with all his ill U&s;age of me, that I cannot hate him? To be &s;ure, I am not like other People! He has certain|ly done enough to make me hate him; but yet when I heard his Danger, which was very great, I could not in my Heart forbear rejoicing for his Safety; tho' his Death would have ended my Afflictions. Ungenerous Ma&s;ter! if you knew this, you &s;urely would not be &s;o much my Per&s;ecutor! But for my

late good Lady's &s;ake, I mu&s;t wi&s;h him well; and O what an Angel would he be in my Eyes yet, if he would cea&s;e his Attempts, and reform.</P>
<P>Well, I hear by Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> that <HI>John Arnold</HI> is turn'd away, being detected in writing to Mr. <HI>Wil|liams</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jonathan</HI> the Butler, have incurr'd his Di&s;plea&s;ure, for offering to &s;peak in my Behalf. Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> too is in Dan|ger; for all the&s;e three, belike, went together to beg in my Favour; for now it is known where I am.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> has, with the News about my Ma&s;ter, receiv'd a Letter; but &s;he &s;ays the Contents are too bad for me to know. They mu&s;t be bad indeed, if they be wor&s;e than what I have already known.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now the horrid Creature tells me, as a Secret, that &s;he has rea&s;on to think he has found out a Way to &s;atisfy my Scruples: It is, by marrying me to this dreadful <HI>Colbrand,</HI> and buying me of him on the Wedding-day, for a Sum of Money!&mdash;Was ever the like heard?&mdash;She &s;ays it will be my Duty to obey my Husband; and that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> will be forc'd, as a Puni&s;hment, to marry us; and that when my Ma&s;ter has paid for me, and I am &s;urrender'd up, the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> is to go home again, with the Money, to his former Wife and Children; for &s;he &s;ays, it is the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e People to have a Wife in every Nation.</P>
<P>But this, to be &s;ure, is horrid romancing! But abo|minable as it is, it may po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve to introduce &s;ome Plot now hatching!&mdash;With what &s;trange Per|plexities is my poor Mind agitated!

<HEAD>FRIDAY, the <HI>36</HI>th Day of my Impri&s;onment.</HEAD>
<P>I Took the Liberty ye&s;terday Afternoon, finding the Gates open, to walk out before the Hou&s;e; and ere I was aware, had got to the Bottom of the long Row of Elms; and there I &s;at my&s;elf down upon the Steps of a &s;ort of broad Stile, which leads into the Road, that goes towards the Town. And as I &s;at mu&s;ing about what always bu&s;ies my Mind, I &s;aw a whole Body of Folks, running towards me from the Hou&s;e, Men and Women, as in a Fright. At fir&s;t I wonder'd what was the Matter, till they came nearer; and I found they were all alarm'd, thinking I had attempted to get off. There was fir&s;t the horrible <HI>Colbrand,</HI> running with his long Legs, well nigh two Yards at a Stride; then there was one of the Grooms, poor Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Robber; then I &s;py'd <HI>Nan,</HI> half out of Breath; and the Cook-maid after her; and la&s;tly, came waddling, as fa&s;t as &s;he could, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> exclaiming mo&s;t bitterly, as I found, again&s;t me. <HI>Colbrand</HI> &s;aid, O how have you frighted us all!&mdash;And went behind me, le&s;t I &s;hould run away, as I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>

I found her terribly incens'd, and raving about my Contrivances. Why &s;aid I, &s;hould you be &s;o con|cerned?

She would not believe me; and the barbarous Creature &s;truck at me with her horrid Fi&s;t, and, I believe, would have felled me, had not <HI>Colbrand</HI> interpo&s;ed, and &s;aid, He &s;aw me &s;itting &s;till, looking about me, and not &s;eem|ing to have the lea&s;t Inclination to &s;tir. But this would not &s;erve: She order'd the two Maids to take me each by an Arm, and lead me back into the Hou&s;e, and up Stairs; and there have I been lock'd up ever &s;ince, without Shoes. In vain have I pleaded that I had no De&s;ign, as indeed I had not the lea&s;t; and, la&s;t Night I was forced to lie between her and <HI>Nan</HI>; and I find &s;he is re&s;olved to make a Handle of this again&s;t me, and in her own Behalf&mdash;In|deed, what with her U&s;age, and my own Appre|hen&s;ions of &s;till wor&s;e, I am quite weary of my Life.</P>

<HEAD>SATURDAY Morning.</HEAD>
<P>NOW let me give you an Account of what pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t Night; for I had no Power to write, nor yet Opportunity, till now.</P>
<P>This vile Woman held my Ma&s;ter till half an Hour after Seven; and he came hither about Five in the Afternoon. And then I heard his Voice on the Stairs, as he was coming up to me. It was about his Supper; for he &s;aid, I &s;hall chu&s;e a boil'd Chicken, with Butter and Par&s;ley.&mdash;And up he came!</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="282">He put on a &s;tern and maje&s;tick Air; and he can look very maje&s;tick when he plea&s;es. Well, perver&s;e <HI>Pamela,</HI> ungrateful Runaway, &s;aid he, for my fir&s;t Salutation!&mdash;You do well, don't you, to give me all this Trouble and Vexation? I could not &s;peak; but throwing my &s;elf on the Floor, hid my Face, and was ready to die with Grief and Apprehen&s;ion.&mdash; He &s;aid, Well may you hide your Face! well may you be a&s;hamed to &s;ee me, vile forward one, as you are!&mdash;I &s;obb'd, and wept, but could not &s;peak. And he let me lie, and went to the Door, and called Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI>&mdash;There, &s;aid he, take up that fallen Angel!&mdash;Once I thought her as innocent as an Angel of Light. But I have now no Patience with her. The lit|tle Hypocrite pro&s;trates her &s;elf thus, in hopes to move my Weakne&s;s in her Favour, and that I'll rai&s;e her from the Floor my&s;elf. But I &s;hall not touch her: No, &s;aid he, cruel Gentleman as he was! let &s;uch Fellows as <HI>Williams</HI> be taken in by her artful Wiles, I know her now, and &s;ee &s;he is for any Fool's Turn, that will be caught by her.</P>
<P>I &s;ighed, as if my Heart would break!&mdash;And Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> lifted me up upon my Knees: for I trembled &s;o, I could not &s;tand. Come, &s;aid &s;he, Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> learn to know your be&s;t Friend; con|fe&s;s, your unworthy Behaviour, and beg his Honour's Forgivene&s;s of all Your Faults.

<P>I was &s;truck to the Heart at this; but could not &s;peak pre&s;ently; only lifted up my Eyes to Heaven! &mdash;And at la&s;t made &s;hift to &s;ay&mdash;God forgive you, Sir!&mdash;He &s;eem'd in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, and walked up and down the Room, ca&s;ting &s;ometimes an Eye upon me, and &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng as if he would have &s;poken, but check'd him&s;elf And at la&s;t he &s;aid, When &s;he has <HI>acted</HI> this her <HI>fir&s;t Part</HI> over, perhaps I will &s;ee

<P>And &s;o he went out of the Room: And I was quite &s;ick at Heart!&mdash;Surely, &s;aid I, I am the wicked|e&s;t Creature that ever breath'd! Well, &s;aid the Im|pertinent, not &s;o wicked as <HI>that</HI> neither; but I am glad you begin to &s;ee your Faults. Nothing like be|ing humble!&mdash;Come I'll &s;tand your Friend, and plead for you, if you'll promi&s;e to be more dutiful for the future: Come, come, added the Wretch, this may be all made up by to-morrow Morning, if you are not a Fool.&mdash;Begone, hideous Woman! &s;aid I; and let not my Afflictions be added to by thy inexorable Cruelty, and unwomanly Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>She gave me a Pu&s;h, and went away in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion. And it &s;eems, &s;he made a Story of this; and &s;aid, I had &s;uch a Spirit, there was no hearing it.</P>
<P>I laid me down on the Floor, and had no Power to &s;tir, till the Clock &s;truck Nine; and then the wicked Woman came up again. You mu&s;t come down Stairs, &s;aid &s;he, to my Ma&s;ter; that is, if you plea&s;e, Spirit!&mdash;Said I, I believe I cannot &s;tand. Then, &s;aid, &s;he, I'll &s;end Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbrand</HI> to carry you down.</P>
<P>I got up, as well as I could, and trembled all the way down Stairs. And &s;he went before me into the Parlour; and a new Servant, that he had waiting on him in&s;tead of <HI>John,</HI> withdrew as &s;oon as I came in. And, by the way, he had a new Coachman too, which looked as if <HI>Bedford&s;hire Robin</HI> was turn'd away.</P>
<P>I thought, &s;aid he, when I came down, you &s;hould have &s;at at Table with we, when I had not Company; but when I find you cannot forget you Original, but mu&s;t prefer my Menials to me, I call you down to wait on me, while I &s;up, that I may have &s;ome Talk with you, and throw away as little Time as po&s;&s;ible upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="284">Sir, &s;aid I, you do me Honour to wait upon you. &mdash;And I never &s;hall, I hope, forget my Original. But I was forced to &s;tand behind his Chair, that I might hold by it. Fill me, &s;aid he, a Gla&s;s of that <HI>Burgundy.</HI> I went to do it; but my Hand &s;hook &s;o, that I could not hold the Plate with the Gla&s;s in it, and &s;pilt &s;ome of the Wine. So Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> pour'd it for me, and I carry'd it as well as I could; and made a low Court'&s;y. He took it, and &s;aid, Stand behind me, out of my Sight!</P>
<P>Why, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid he, you tell me, &s;he re|mains very &s;ullen &s;till, and eats nothing. No, &s;aid &s;he, not &s;o much as will keep Life and Soul toge|ther.&mdash;And is always crying, you &s;ay, too? Yes, Sir, an&s;wer'd &s;he, I think &s;he is, for one thing or another. Ay, &s;aid he, your young Wenches will feed upon their Tears; and their Ob&s;tinacy will &s;erve them for Meat and Drink. I think I never &s;aw her look better, tho, in my Life! &mdash; But I &s;up|po&s;e &s;he lives upon Love. This &s;weet Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and her little villanous Plots together, have kept her alive and well, to be &s;ure. For Mi&s;chief, Love, and Contradiction, are the natural Ailments of a Woman.</P>
<P>Poor I was forced to hear all this, and be &s;ilent; and indeed my Heart was too full to &s;peak.</P>
<P>And &s;o you &s;ay, &s;aid he, that &s;he had <HI>another</HI> Project, but Ye&s;terday, to get away? She denies it her&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he; but it had all the Appearance of one. I'm &s;ure &s;he made me in a fearful Pucker a|bout it. And I am glad your Honour is come, with all my Heart; and I hope, whatever be your Ho|nour's Intention concerning her, you will not be long about it; for you'll find her as &s;lippery as an Eel, I'll a&s;&s;ure you!</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, and clap&s;ed his Knees with my Arms, not knowing what I did, and falling on my Knees,
<PB N="246" REF="285">
Have Mercy on me, and hear me, concerning that wicked Woman's U&s;age of me.&mdash;</P>
<P>He cruelly interrupted me, and &s;aid, I am &s;atisfy'd &s;he has done her Duty: It &s;ignifies nothing what you &s;ay again&s;t Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> That you are here, little Hypocrite as you are, pleading your Cau&s;e be|fore me, is owing to her Care of you; el&s;e you had been with the Par&s;on&mdash;Wicked Girl! &s;aid he, to tempt a Man to undo him&s;elf, as you have done him, at a Time when I was on the Point of making him happy for his Life!</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, but &s;aid, with a deep Sigh, I have done, Sir,&mdash;I have done!&mdash;I have a &s;trange Tribunal to plead before. The poor Sheep, in the Fable, had &s;uch an one; when it was try'd before the Vultur, on the Accu&s;ation of the Wolf!</P>
<P>So, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid he, you are the Wolf, I the Vultur, and this the poor innocent Lamb, on her Trial before us&mdash;Oh! you don't know how well this Innocent is read in Reflection. She has Wit at Will, when &s;he has a mind to di&s;play her own romantick Innocence, at the Price of other People's Characters.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid the aggravating Creature this is nothing to what &s;he has called me; I have been a <HI>Jezebel,</HI> a <HI>London</HI> Pro&s;titute, and what not?&mdash;But I am contented with her ill Names, now I &s;ee it is her Fa&s;hion, and &s;he can call your Honour a Vultur.</P>
<P>Said I, I had no Thought of comparing my Ma|&s;ter&mdash;And was going to &s;ay on: But he &s;aid, Don't prate, Girl!&mdash;No, &s;aid &s;he, it don't become you, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, &s;ince I mu&s;t not &s;peak, I will hold my Peace: But there is a righteous Judge, who knows the Secrets of all Hearts! and to Him I appeal.</P>
<P>See there! &s;aid he: Now this meek, good Crea|ture is praying for Fire from Heaven upon us! O

&s;he can cur&s;e mo&s;t heartily, in the Spirit of Chri|&s;tian Meekne&s;s, I'll a&s;&s;ure you!&mdash;Come, Sawcy-face, give me another Gla&s;s of Wine!</P>
<P>So I did, as well as I could; but wept &s;o, that he &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall have &s;ome of your Tears in my Wine!</P>
<P>When he had &s;upp'd, he &s;tood up, and &s;aid, O how happy for you it is, that you can at Will, thus make your &s;peaking Eyes overflow in this manner, without lo&s;ing any of their Brilliancy! You have been told, I &s;uppo&s;e, that you are <HI>mo&s;t</HI> beautiful in your Tears!&mdash;Did you ever, &s;aid he to <HI>her,</HI> (who all thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> while was &s;tanding in one Corner of the Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur) &s;ee a more charming Creature than this? Is it to be wonder'd at, that I demean my&s;elf thus to take No|tice of her!&mdash;See, &s;aid he, and took the Gla&s;s with one Hand, and turn'd me round with the other, What a Shape! what a Neck! what a Hand! and what a Bloom in that lovely Face!&mdash;But who can de&s;cribe the Tricks and Artifices, that lie lurk|ing in her little, plotting, guileful Heart! 'Tis no Wonder the poor Par&s;on was infatuated with her&mdash; I blame him le&s;s than I do her; for who could ex|pect &s;uch Artifice in &s;o young a Sorcere&s;s!</P>
<P>I went to the further part of the Room, and held my Face again&s;t the Wain&s;cot; and, in &s;pite of all I could do to refrain crying, &s;obb'd, as if my Heart would break. He &s;aid, I am &s;urpriz'd, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> at the Mi&s;take of the Letters you tell me of! But, you &s;ee, I am not afraid any body &s;hould read what I write.

<P>Come hither, Hu&s;&s;y, &s;aid he; you and I have a dreadful Reckoning to make.&mdash;Why don't you come, when I bid you?&mdash;Fie upon it! Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI>

&s;aid &s;he, what! not &s;tir, when his Honour command&punc; you to come to him!&mdash;Who knows but his Good|ne&s;s will forgive you?</P>
<P>He came to me, (for I had no power to &s;tir) and put his Arms about my Neck, and would ki&s;s me; and &s;aid, Well, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> if it were not for the Thought of this cur&s;ed Par&s;on, I believe in my Heart, &s;o great is my Weakne&s;s, that I could <HI>yet</HI> forgive this intriguing little Slut, and take her to my Bo|&s;om.</P>
<P>O, &s;aid the Sycophant, yen are very good, Sir, very forgiving, indeed!&mdash;But come, added the pro|fligate Wretch, I hope you will be &s;o good, as to take her to your Bo&s;om; and that, by to-morrow Morning, you'll bring her to a better Sen&s;e of her Duty!</P>
<P>Could any thing, in Womanhood, be &s;o vile!

But the Word was the Subject of their Ridicule. Was ever poor Crea|ture wor&s;e be&s;et!</P>
<P>He &s;aid, as if he had been con&s;idering whether he could forgive me or not, No, I cannot yet for|give her neither&mdash;She has given me great Di&s;turb|ance; has brought great di&s;credit upon me, both abroad and at home; has corrupted all my Servants at the other Hou&s;e; has de&s;pi&s;ed my honourable Views and Intentions to her, and &s;ought to run away with this ingrateful Par&s;on&mdash;And &s;urely I ought not to forgive all this!&mdash;Yet, with all this wretch|ed Grimace, he ki&s;&s;ed me again, and would have put his Hand in my Bo&s;om; but I &s;truggled, and &s;aid, I would <HI>die</HI> before I would be u&s;ed thus.&mdash; Con&s;ider, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, in a Threatening Tone, con&s;ider where you are! and don't play the Fool:
<PB N="249" REF="288">
If you do, a more dreadful Fate awaits you than you expect.

But no Wonder!&mdash;It &s;hews what Hands I am got into!&mdash;Ay, &s;o it does, &s;aid &s;he; but I beg you'll undre&s;s, and come to-bed, or I believe your Inno|cence won't keep you from <HI>&s;till wor&s;e</HI> Hands. I will come to-bed, &s;aid I, if you will let me have the Keys in my own Hand; not el&s;e, if I can help it. Yes, &s;aid &s;he, and then, hey! for another Contrivance, another E&s;cape!&mdash;No, no, &s;aid I, all my Contri|vances are over, I'll a&s;&s;ure you! Pray let me have the Keys, and I will come to bed. She came to me, and took me in her huge Arms, as if I was a Feather; &s;aid &s;he, I do this to &s;hew you, what a poor Re&s;i&s;tance you can make again&s;t me, if I plea&s;ed to exert my &s;elf; and &s;o, Lambkin, don't &s;ay to your Wolf, I <HI>won't</HI> come to bed!&mdash;And &s;et me down, and tapped me on the Neck: Ah! &s;aid &s;he thou art a pretty Creature, it's true; but &s;o ob&s;tinate! &s;o full of Spirit! If thy Strength was but an&s;werable to that, thou would&s;t run away with us all, and this great Hou&s;e too on thy Back!-But undre&s;s, undre&s;s, I tell you.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, I &s;ee my Misfortunes make you very merry, and very witty too: But I will <HI>love</HI> you, if you will humour me with the Keys of the Cham|ber-doors.&mdash;Are you <HI>&s;ure</HI> you will love me, &s;aid &s;he?&mdash;Now &s;peak your Con&s;cience!&mdash;Why, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t not put it &s;o clo&s;e; neither would you,
<PB N="262" REF="301">
if you thought you had not given Rea&s;on to doubt it!&mdash;But I will love you as well as I can!&mdash;I would not tell a wilful Lye: And if I did, you would not believe me, after your hard U&s;age of me. Well, &s;aid &s;he, that's all fair, I own!&mdash;But <HI>Nan,</HI> pray pull off my young Lady's Shoes and Stockens.&mdash;No, pray don't, &s;aid I; I will come to-bed pre&s;ently, &s;ince I mu&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;o I went to the Clo&s;et, and &s;cribbled a little about this idle Chit-chat. And &s;he being impor|tunate, I was forced to go to-bed; but with &s;ome of my Cloaths on, as the former Night; and &s;he let me hold the two Keys; for there are two Locks, there being a double Door; and &s;o I got a little Sleep that Night, having had none for two or three Nights before.</P>
<P>I can't imagine what &s;he means; but <HI>Nan</HI> offer'd to talk a little once or twice; and &s;he &s;nubb'd her, and &s;aid, I charge you, Wench, don't open your Lips before me! And if you are asked any Que|&s;tions by Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> don't an&s;wer her one Word, while I am here!&mdash;But &s;he is a lordly Woman to to the Maid-&s;ervants, and that has always been her Character. O how unlike good Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> in every thing!</P>

<HEAD>SUNDAY Morning.</HEAD>
<P>A Thought came into my Head; I meant no Harm; but it was a little bold. For &s;eeing my Ma&s;ter dre&s;&s;ing to go to Church, and his Chariot getting ready, I went to my Clo&s;et, and I writ,
<Q>The Prayers of this Congregation are earne&s;tly de&s;ired for a Gentlemen of great Worth and Ho|nour, who labours under a Temptation to ex|ert his great Power to ruin a poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, worthle&s;s Maiden.</Q>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> came up; Always writing, &s;aid &s;he! and would &s;ee it. And &s;trait, all that ever I could &s;ay, carry'd it down to my Ma&s;ter.&mdash;He look'd upon it, and &s;aid, Tell her, &s;he &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee how her Prayers are an&s;wer'd. She is very bold. But as &s;he has rejected all my Favours, her Reckoning for all, is not far off. I look'd after him, out of the Window, and he was charmingly dre&s;s'd: To be &s;ure, he is a hand&s;ome fine Gentleman!&mdash;What pity his Heart is not as good as his Appearance! Why can't I hate him?&mdash;But don't be unea&s;y, if you &s;hould &s;ee this; for it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould love him; for his Vices all <HI>ugly him over,</HI> as I may &s;ay.</P>

All his Trouble is brought upon him for my &s;ake: This grieves me much. My Ma&s;ter it &s;eems, will have his Money from him. This is very hard; for it is three fifty Pounds, he gave him, as he thought, as a Salary for three Years that he has been with him. But there was no Agree|ment between them; and he ab&s;olutely depended on my Ma&s;ter's Favour. To be &s;ure, it was the more generous of him to run the&s;e Ri&s;ques for the &s;ake of oppre&s;&s;ed Innocence; and I hope he will meet with his Reward in due Time. Alas for me! I dare not plead for him; that would rai&s;e my Op|pre&s;&s;or's Jealou&s;y more. And I have not Intere&s;t to &s;ave my&s;elf!</P>

<P>MRS. <HI>Jewkes</HI> has received a Line from my Ma|&s;ter. I wonder what it is; but his Chariot is come home without him. But &s;he will tell me nothing; &s;o it is in vain to ask her.

<P>I had but ju&s;t fini&s;hed taking a Copy of this, and laid the Letter where I had it, and unbolted the Door, when &s;he came up in a great Fright, for fear I &s;hould have &s;een it; but I being in my Clo&s;et, and that lying as &s;he left it, &s;he did not mi&s;tru&s;t. O, &s;aid &s;he, I was afraid you had &s;een my Ma&s;ter's Letter here, which I carele&s;ly le&s;t on the Table. I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, I had known that. Why &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he, if you had, you would not have offered to read my Letters!

To be &s;ure, added &s;he, he is a very good Gentleman, and very forgiving! &mdash;Why, &s;aid I, as If I had known nothing of the Matter, how can he make up Matters with him? Is not Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> at <HI>Stamford?</HI> Yes, &s;aid &s;he, I believe &s;o; but Par&s;on <HI>Peters</HI> pleads for him, and he is gone with him to <HI>Stamford,</HI> and will not be back to-night: So, we have nothing to do, but to eat our Suppers betimes, and go to-bed.

<HEAD>TUESDAY Night.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the future, I will always mi&s;tru&s;t mo&s;t, when Appearances look faire&s;t. O your poor Daughter! what has &s;he not &s;uffer'd &s;ince what I wrote of <HI>Sunday</HI> Night!&mdash;My wor&s;t Trial, and my fearfulle&s;t Danger! O how I &s;hudder to write you an Account of this wicked Interval of Time! For, my dear Parents, will you not be too much frighten'd and affected with my Di&s;tre&s;s, when I tell you, that his Journey to <HI>Stamford</HI> was all abominable Pre|tence? for he came home privately, and had well nigh effected all his vile Purpo&s;es&punc; and the Ruin of your poor Daughter; and that by &s;uch a Plot as I was not in the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive of: And Oh! you'll hear what a vile and unwomanly Part that wicked Wretch, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> acted in it!</P>
<P>I left off with letting you know how much I was plea&s;ed, that I had one Night's Reprieve added to my Hone&s;ty. But I had le&s;s Occa&s;ion to rejoice than ever, as you will judge by what I have &s;aid already. Take then the dreadful Story as well as I can relate it.</P>
<P>The Maid <HI>Nan</HI> is a little apt to drink, if &s;he can get at Liquor; and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> happen'd, or de|&s;ign'd, as is too probable, to leave a Bottle of Cherry-brandy in her way, and the Wench drank &s;ome of it more than &s;he &s;hould; and when &s;he came in to lay the Cloth, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> perceiv'd it, and fell a rating at her mo&s;t &s;adly; for &s;he has too many Faults of her own, to &s;uffer any of the like &s;ort in any body el&s;e, if &s;he can help it; and &s;he bid her get out of her Sight, when we had &s;upp'd, and go to-bed, to &s;leep off her Liquor, before we came to-bed.
<PB N="267" REF="306">
And &s;o the poor Maid went muttering up Stairs.</P>
<P>About two Hours after, which was near Eleven o'Clock, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> and I went up to go to-bed; I plea&s;ing my&s;elf with what a charming Night I &s;hould have. We lock'd both Doors, and &s;aw poor <HI>Nan,</HI> as I thought, (for Oh! 'twas my abominable Ma&s;ter, as you &s;hall hear by-and-by) &s;itting fa&s;t a&s;leep, in an Elbow-chair, in a dark Corner of the Room, with her Apron thrown over her Head and Neck. And Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> &s;aid, There is that Bea&s;t of a Wench fa&s;t a&s;leep, in&s;tead of being a bed! I knew, &s;aid &s;he, &s;he had taken a fine Do&s;e. I'll wake her, &s;aid I, No, don't, &s;aid &s;he, let her &s;leep on; we &s;hall lie better without her. Ay, &s;aid I, &s;o we &s;hall; but won't &s;he get Cold?</P>
<P>Said &s;he, I hope you have no Writing to-night. No, reply'd I, I will go to-bed with you, Mrs <HI>Jewkes.</HI> Said &s;he, I wonder what you can find to write about &s;o much; and am &s;ure you have better Conveniencies of that kind, and more Paper, than I am aware of; and I had intended to romage you, if my Ma&s;ter had not come down; for I '&s;py'd a broken Tea-cup with Ink, which gave me a Su&s;pi|cion; but as he is come, let him look after you, if he will; and if you deceive him, it will be his own Fault.</P>
<P>All this time we were undre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves. And I fetch'd a deep Sigh! What do you &s;igh for? &s;aid &s;he, I am thinking, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> an&s;wer'd I, what a &s;ad Life I live, and how hard is my Lot. I am &s;ure the Thief that has robb'd, is much better off than I, 'bating the Guilt; and I &s;hould, I think, take it for a Mercy, to be hang'd out of the way, rather than live in the&s;e cruel Apprehen&s;ions. So, being not &s;leepy, and in a prattling Vein, I began to give a little Hi&s;tory of my&s;elf, as I did once before to Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis</HI>; in this manner;</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="307">Here, &s;aid I, were my poor hone&s;t Parents; they took care to in&s;til good Principles into my Mind, till I was almo&s;t twelve Years of Age; and taught me to prefer Goodne&s;s and Poverty to the highe&s;t Condition of Life; and they confirm'd their Le&s;&s;ons by their own Practice; for they were of late Years remarkably poor, and always as remarkably hone&s;t, even to a Proverb; for, <HI>As hone&s;t as Goodman</HI> ANDREWS, was a Bye-word.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid I, comes my late dear good Lady, and takes a Fancy to me, and &s;aid, &s;he would be the making of me, if I was a good Girl; and &s;he put me to &s;ing, to dance, to play on the Spinnet, in order to divert her melancholy Hours; and al&s;o learnt me all manner of fine Needle-work; but &s;till this was her Le&s;&s;on, <HI>My good</HI> Pamela, <HI>be virtuous, and keep the Men at a Di&s;tance:</HI> Well, &s;o I was, I hope, and &s;o I did; and yet, tho' I &s;ay it, they all loved me and re&s;pected me; and would do any thing for me, as if I was a Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>But then, what comes next?&mdash;Why, it plea&s;ed God to take my good Lady; and then comes my Ma&s;ter: And what &s;ays he?&mdash;Why, in Effect, it is, <HI>Be Not Virtuous,</HI> Pamela.</P>
<P>So here have I lived above &s;ixteen Years in Virtue and Reputation, and, all at once, when I come to know what is Good, and what is Evil, I mu&s;t re|nounce all the Good, all the whole Sixteen Years In|nocence, which, next to God's Grace, I owed chiefly to my Parents and my Lady's good Le&s;&s;ons and Ex|amples; and chu&s;e the Evil; and &s;o, in a Moment's Time, become the vile&s;t of Creatures! And all this, for what, I pray? Why truly, for a Pair of Diamond Ear-rings, a Necklace, and a Diamond Ring for my Finger; which would not become me: for a few paltry fine Cloaths; which when I wore, it would make but my former Poverty more ridiculous to
<PB N="269" REF="308">
every body that &s;aw me; e&s;pecially when they knew the ba&s;e Terms I wore them upon. But indeed, I was to have a great Parcel of Guineas be&s;ide; I forget how many; for had there been ten times more, they would have been not &s;o much to me, as the hone&s;t Six Guineas you trick'd me out of, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI></P>
<P>Well, for&s;ooth! but then I was to have I know not how many Pounds a Year for my Life; and my poor Father (there was the Je&s;t of it!) was to be the Manager for the abandon'd Pro&s;titute his Daughter: And then (there was the Je&s;t again!) my kind, for|giving, virtuous Ma&s;ter, would pardon me all my Mi&s;deeds!</P>
<P>Yes, thank him for nothing, truly. And what, pray, are all the&s;e violent Mi&s;deeds?&mdash;Why, they are for daring to adhere to the good Le&s;&s;ons that were taught me; and not learning a new one, that would have rever&s;ed all my former: For not being contented when I was run away with, in order to ruin me; but contriving, if my poor Wits had been able, to get out of Danger, and pre&s;erve my&s;elf hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Then was he once jealous of poor <HI>John,</HI> tho' he knew <HI>John</HI> was his own Creature, and helped to deceive me.</P>
<P>Then was he outrageous again&s;t poor Par&s;on <HI>Wil|liams</HI>; and him has this good, merciful Ma&s;ter thrown into Goal; and for what? Why truly, for that being a Divine, and a good Man, he had the Fear of God before his Eyes, and was willing to forego all his Expectations of Intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;i&s;t an oppre&s;&s;ed poor Creature.</P>
<P>But to be &s;ure, I mu&s;t be forward, bold, &s;aucy, and what not? to dare to run away from certain Ruin, and to &s;trive to e&s;cape from an unju&s;t Confinement; and I mu&s;t be married to the Par&s;on, nothing &s;o &s;ure!</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="309">He would have had but a poor Catch of me, had I con&s;ented; but he, and <HI>you</HI> too, know, I did not want to marry <HI>any body.</HI> I only wanted to go to my poor Parents, and to have my own Liberty, and not to be confined to &s;uch an unlawful Re&s;traint; and which would not be inflicted upon me, but only that I am a poor, de&s;titute, young Body, and have no Friend that is able to right me.</P>
<P>So, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, here is my Hi&s;tory in brief. And I am a very unhappy young Creature, to be &s;ure! &mdash;And why am I &s;o?&mdash;Why, becau&s;e my Ma&s;ter &s;ees &s;omething in my Per&s;on that takes his pre&s;ent Fancy; and becau&s;e I would not be un|done.&mdash;Why therefore, to chu&s;e, I mu&s;t, and I &s;hall be undone!&mdash;And this is all the Rea&s;on that can be given!</P>
<P>She heard me run on all this time, while I was undres&s;ing, without any Interruption; and I &s;aid, Well, I mu&s;t go to the two Clo&s;ets, ever &s;ince an Affair of the Clo&s;et at the other Hou&s;e, tho' he is &s;o far off. And I have a good mind to wake this poor Maid. No, don't, &s;aid &s;he, I charge you. I am very angry with her, and &s;he'll get no Harm there; but if &s;he wakes, &s;he may come to-bed well enough, as long as there is a Candle in the Chimney.</P>
<P>So I looked into the Clo&s;ets,and kneeled down in my own, as I u&s;ed to do, to &s;ay my Prayers, and this with my under Cloaths in my Hand, all undre&s;t; and pa&s;&s;ed by the poor &s;leeping Wench, as I thought, in my Return. But, Oh! little did I think, it was my wicked, wicked Ma&s;ter in a Gown and Petticoat of hers, and her Apron over his Face and Shoulders. What Meanne&s;&s;es will not <HI>Lucifer</HI> make his Vota|ries &s;toop to, to gain their abominable Ends!</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> by this time, was got to-bed, on the further Side, as &s;he u&s;ed to be; and, to make room for the Maid, when &s;he &s;hould awake, I got
<PB N="271" REF="310">
into Bed, and lay clo&s;e to her. And I &s;aid, Where are the Keys? tho', &s;aid I, I am not &s;o much afraid to-night. Here, &s;aid the wicked Woman, put your Arm under mine, and you &s;hall find them about my Wri&s;t, as they u&s;ed to be. So I did, and the abomi|nable De&s;igner held my Hand with her Right-hand, as my Right-arm was under her Left.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour, I &s;aid, There's poor <HI>Nan</HI> awake; I hear her &s;tir. Let us go to &s;leep, &s;aid &s;he, and not mind her: She'll come to-bed, when &s;he's quite awake. Poor Soul! &s;aid I, I'll warrant &s;he will have the Head-ach finely to|morrow for it! Be &s;ilent, &s;aid &s;he, and go to &s;leep; you keep me awake; and I never found you in &s;o talkative a Humour in my Life. Don't chide me, &s;aid I; I will &s;ay but one thing more: Do you think <HI>Nan</HI> could hear me talk of my Ma&s;ter's Offers? No, no, &s;aid &s;he; &s;he was dead a&s;leep. I'm glad of that, &s;aid I; becau&s;e I would not expo&s;e my Ma&s;ter to his common Servants; and I knew <HI>you</HI> were no Stranger to his <HI>fine</HI> Articles. Said &s;he, I think they were fine Articles, and you were bewitch'd you did not clo&s;e in with them: But let us go to &s;leep. So I was &s;ilent; and the pretended <HI>Nan</HI> (O wicked ba&s;e, villainous De&s;igner! what a Plot, what an unexpected Plot, was this!) &s;eem'd to be awaking; and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> abhorred Creature! &s;aid, Come, <HI>Nan!</HI>&mdash;what, are you awake at la&s;t? Pr'ythee come to-bed; for Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI> is in a talking Fit, and won't go to &s;leep one while.</P>
<P>At that the pretended She came to the Bed &s;ide; and &s;itting down in a Chair, where the Curtain hid her, began to undre&s;s. Said I, Poor Mrs. <HI>Ann,</HI> I warrant your Head aches mo&s;t &s;adly! How do you do?&mdash;She an&s;wer'd not one Word. Said the &s;u|perlatively wicked Woman, You know I have or|der'd
<PB N="272" REF="311">
her not to an&s;wer you, And this Plot, to be &s;ure, was laid when &s;he gave her the&s;e Orders, the Night before.</P>
<P>I heard her, as I thought, breathe all quick and &s;hort: Indeed, &s;aid I, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> the poor Maid is not well. What ails you, Mrs. <HI>Ann?</HI> And &s;till no An&s;wer was made.</P>
<P>But, I tremble to relate it! the pretended She came into Bed; but quiver'd like an A&s;pen-leaf; and I, poor Fool that I was! pitied her much.&mdash;But well might the barbarous Deceiver tremble at his vile Di&s;&s;imulation, and ba&s;e De&s;igns.</P>
<P>What Words &s;hall I find, my dear Mother, (for my Father &s;hould not &s;ee this &s;hocking Part) to de|&s;cribe the re&s;t, and my Confu&s;ion, when the guilty Wretch took my left Arm, and laid it under his Neck, as the vile Procure&s;s held my Right; and then he cla&s;p'd me round my Wai&s;t!</P>
<P>Said I, Is the Wench mad! Why, how now, Confidence? thinking &s;till it had been <HI>Nan.</HI> But he ki&s;&s;ed me with frightful Vehemence; and then his Voice broke upon me like a Clap of Thunder. Now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, is the dreadful Time of Reckoning come, that I have threaten'd.&mdash;I &s;cream'd out in &s;uch a manner, as never any body heard the like. But there was nobody to help me: And both my Hands were &s;ecured, as I &s;aid. Sure never poor Soul was in &s;uch Agonies as I. Wicked Man! &s;aid I; wicked, abominable Woman! O God! my God! this <HI>Time,</HI> this <HI>one</HI> Time! deliver me from this Di|&s;tre&s;s! or &s;trike me dead this Moment. And then I &s;cream'd again and again.</P>
<P>Says he, One Word with you, <HI>Pamela</HI>; one Word hear me but; and hitherto you &s;ee I offer nothing to you. Is this <HI>nothing,</HI> &s;aid I, to be in Bed here? To hold my Hands between you? I will hear, if
<PB N="273" REF="312">
you will in&s;tantly leave the Bed, and take this vil|lainous Woman from me!</P>
<P>Said &s;he, (O Di&s;grace of Womankind!) What you do, Sir, do; don't &s;tand dilly-dallying. She cannot exclaim wor&s;e than &s;he has done. And &s;he'll be quieter when &s;he knows the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>Silence! &s;aid he to her; I mu&s;t &s;ay one Word to you, <HI>Pamela</HI>; it is this: You &s;ee, now you are in my Power!&mdash;You cannot get from me, nor help your&s;elf: Yet have I not offer'd any thing ami&s;s to you. But if you re&s;olve not to comply with my Propo&s;als, I will not lo&s;e this Opportunity: If you do, I will yet leave you.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid I, leave me, leave me but, and I will do any thing I ought to do.&mdash;Swear then to me, &s;aid he, that you will accept my Propo&s;als!&mdash;and then (for this was all dete&s;table Grimace) he put his Hand in my Bo&s;om. With Struggling, Fright, Terror, I fainted away quite, and did not come to my&s;elf &s;oon; &s;o that they both, from the cold Sweats that I was in, thought me dying&mdash;And I remember no more, than that, when, with great Difficulty, they brought me to my&s;elf, &s;he was &s;itting on one &s;ide of the Bed, with her Cloaths on; and he on the other with his, and in his Gown and Slippers.</P>
<P>Your poor <HI>Pamela</HI> cannot an&s;wer for the Liber|ties taken with her in her deplorable State of Death. And when I &s;aw them there, I &s;at up in my Bed, without any Regard to what Appearance I made, and nothing about my Neck; and he &s;oothing me, with an A&s;pect of Pity and Concern, I put my Hand to his Mouth, and &s;aid, O tell me, yet tell me not, what I have &s;uffer'd in this Di&s;tre&s;s! And I talked quite wild, and knew not what; for, to be &s;ure, I was on the Point of Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>He mo&s;t &s;olemnly, and with a bitter Imprecation, vow'd, that he had not offer'd the lea&s;t Indecency;
<PB N="274" REF="313">
that he was frighten'd at the terrible manner I was taken with the Fit: That he would de&s;i&s;t from his Attempt; and begg'd but to &s;ee me ea&s;y and quiet, and he would leave me directly, and go to his own Bed. O then, &s;aid I, take from me this mo&s;t wick|ed Woman, this vile Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> as an Earne&s;t that I may believe you!</P>
<P>And will you, Sir, &s;aid the wicked Wretch, for a Fit or two, give up &s;uch an Opportunity as this?&mdash; I thought you had known the Sex better.&mdash;She is now, you &s;ee, quite well again!</P>
<P>This I heard; more &s;he might &s;ay; but I fainted away once more, at the&s;e Words, and at his cla&s;ping his Arms about me again. And when I came a little to my&s;elf, I &s;aw him &s;it there, and the Maid <HI>Nan,</HI> holding a Smelling-bottle to my No&s;e, and no Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aid, taking my Hand, Now will I vow to you, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> that I will leave you the Mo|ment I &s;ee you better, and pacify'd. Here's <HI>Nan</HI> knows, and will tell you, my Concern for you. I vow to God, I have not offered any Indecency to you. And &s;ince I found Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> &s;o offen&s;ive to you, I have &s;ent her to the Maid's Bed, and the Maid &s;hall lie with you to-night. And but promi&s;e me that you will compo&s;e your&s;elf, and I will leave you. But, &s;aid I, will not <HI>Nan</HI> al&s;o hold my Hand? And will not &s;he let you come in again to me?&mdash; He &s;aid, by Heaven! I will not come in again to-night. <HI>Nan,</HI> undre&s;s your&s;elf, go to-bed, and do all you can to comfort the dear Creature: And now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, give me but your Hand, and &s;ay you forgive me, and I will leave you to your Repo&s;e. I held out my trembling Hand, which he vouch&s;afed to ki&s;s, and I &s;aid, God for|give you, Sir, as you <HI>have been</HI> ju&s;t in my Di&s;tre&s;s; and as you <HI>will be</HI> ju&s;t to what you promi&s;e! And
<PB N="275" REF="314">
he withdrew, with a Countenance of Remor&s;e, as I hoped; and &s;he &s;hut the Doors, and, at my Re|que&s;t, brought the Keys to-bed.</P>
<P>This, O my dear Parents! was a mo&s;t dreadful Trial. I tremble &s;till to think of it; and dare not recal all the horrid Circum&s;tances of it. I hope, as he a&s;&s;ures me, he was not guilty of Indecency; but have Rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, who, by di&s;abling me in my Faculties, enabled me to pre&s;erve my Innocence; and when all my Strength would have &s;ignified nothing, magnified him&s;elf in my Weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was &s;o weak all Day on <HI>Monday,</HI> that I lay a-bed. My Ma&s;ter &s;hew'd great Tenderne&s;s for me; and I hope he is really &s;orry, and that this will be his la&s;t Attempt; but he does not &s;ay &s;o neither.</P>
<P>He came in the Morning, as &s;oon as he heard the Door open: And I began to be fearful. He &s;topt &s;hort of the Bed, and &s;aid, Rather than give you Apprehen&s;ions, I will come no further. I &s;aid, Your Honour, Sir, and your Mercy, is all I have to beg. He &s;at him&s;elf on the Side of the Bed, and a&s;ked kindly how I did?&mdash;begg'd me to be compos'd; &s;aid I &s;till look'd a little wildly. And I &s;aid, Pray, good Sir, let me not &s;ee this infamous Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>; I doubt I cannot bear her Sight. She &s;han't come near you all this Day, if you'll promi&s;e to compo&s;e your&s;elf. Then, Sir, I will try. He pre&s;&s;ed my Hand very tenderly, and went out. What a Change does this &s;hew!&mdash;O may it be la&s;ting! But alas! he &s;eems only to have alter'd his Method of Proceeding; but retains, I doubt, his wicked Purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> about Ten o'Clock, when my Ma&s;ter heard I was up, he &s;ent for me down into the Par|lour.
<PB N="276" REF="315">
When I came, he &s;aid, Come nearer to me, <HI>Pamela.</HI> I did &s;o, and he took my Hand, and &s;aid, You begin to look well again. I am glad of it. You little Slut, how did you frighten me on <HI>Sunday</HI> Night! &mdash;Sir, &s;aid I, pray name not that Night; and my Eyes overflow'd at the Remembrance, and I turn'd my Head a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Said he, Place &s;ome little Confidence in me: I know what tho&s;e charming Eyes mean, and you &s;hall not need to explain your&s;elf: For I do a&s;&s;ure you, that as &s;oon as I &s;aw you change, and a cold Sweat bedew your pretty Face, and you fainted away, I quitted the Bed, and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> did &s;o too. And I put on my Gown, and &s;he fetch'd her Smelling-bottle, and we did all we could to re&s;tore you; and my Pa&s;&s;ion for you was all &s;wallowed up in the Concern I had for your Recovery; for I thought I never &s;aw a Fit &s;o &s;trong and violent in my Life; and fear'd we &s;hould not bring you to Life again; for what I &s;aw you in once before, was nothing to it. This, &s;aid he, might be my Folly, and my Unacquaintedne&s;s with what your Sex <HI>can</HI> &s;hew when they are in Earne&s;t. But this I repeat to you, that your Mind may be intirely com|forted&mdash;All I offer'd to you, (and that, I am &s;ure, was innocent) was before you fainted away.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, that was very bad: And it was too plain you had the wor&s;t De&s;igns. When, &s;aid he, I tell you the Truth in one In&s;tance, you may believe me in the other. I know not, I declare beyond this lovely Bo&s;om, your Sex; but that I did intend what you call <HI>the wor&s;t,</HI> is mo&s;t certain: And tho' I would not too much alarm you now, I could cur&s;e my Weakne&s;s, and my Folly, which makes me own, that I love you beyond all your Sex, and cannot live without you. But, if I am Ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, and my own Re&s;olution, I will not attempt to force you to any thing again. Sir, &s;aid I, you may ea&s;ily keep
<PB N="277" REF="316">
your Re&s;olution, if you will &s;end me out of your way, to my poor Parents; that is all I beg.</P>
<P>'Tis a Folly to talk of it, &s;aid he. You mu&s;t not, &s;hall not go! And if I could be a&s;&s;ur'd you would not attempt it, you &s;hould have better U&s;age, and your Confinement &s;hould be made ea&s;ier to you. But to what End, Sir, am I to &s;tay? &s;aid I: You your&s;elf &s;eem not &s;ure you can keep your own pre|&s;ent good Re&s;olutions; and do you think, if I was to &s;tay, when I <HI>could</HI> get away, and be &s;afe, it would not look, as if either I confided too much in my own Strength, or would tempt my Ruin? And as if I was not in Earne&s;t to wi&s;h my&s;elf &s;afe and out of Danger?&mdash;And then, how long am I to &s;tay? And to what Purpo&s;e? And in what Light mu&s;t I appear to the World? Would not <HI>that</HI> cen&s;ure me, altho' I might be innocent? And you will allow, Sir, that if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good Name, or fair Reputation, one mu&s;t not de&s;pi&s;e the World's Cen&s;ure, if one can avoid it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, I &s;ent not for you on this Account, ju&s;t now; but for two Rea&s;ons: The fir&s;t is, that you promi&s;e me, that for a Fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my expre&s;s Con|&s;ent; and this I expect for <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, that I may give you a little more Liberty. And the &s;econd is, That you will &s;ee and forgive Mrs. <HI>Jewkes:</HI> She takes on much, and thinks, that, as all her Fault was her Obedience to me, it would be very hard to &s;acrifice her, as &s;he calls it, to your Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, Sir, &s;aid I, it is a hard Injunction, for the Rea&s;ons I have mentioned. And as to the &s;econd, con&s;idering her vile unwomanly Wicked|ne&s;s, and her Endeavours to in&s;tigate you more to ruin me, when your returning Goodne&s;s &s;eem'd to
<PB N="278" REF="317">
have &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion upon me, it is &s;till harder. But to &s;hew my Obedience to your Commands, (for you know, my dear Parents, I might as well make a Merit of my Compliance, when my Re|fu&s;al would &s;tand me in no &s;tead) I will con|&s;ent to both; and to every thing el&s;e, that you &s;hall be pleas'd to injoin, which I can do with Innocence.</P>
<P>That's my good Girl! &s;aid he, and ki&s;s'd me. This is quite prudent, and &s;hews me, that you don't take in&s;olent Advantage of my Favour for you; and will, perhaps, &s;tand you in more &s;tead than you are aware of.</P>
<P>So he rung the Bell, and &s;aid, call down Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> She came down, and he took my Hand, and put it into hers; and &s;aid, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> I am oblig'd to you for all your Diligence and Fidelity to me; but <HI>Pamela,</HI> I mu&s;t own, is not; becau&s;e the Service I employ'd you in was not &s;o very obliging to her, as I could have wi&s;h'd &s;he would have thought it; and you were not to favour her, but obey me. But yet I'll a&s;&s;ure you, at the very fir&s;t Word, &s;he has <HI>once</HI> obliged me, by con&s;enting to be Friends with you; and, if &s;he gives me no great Cau&s;e, I &s;hall not, perhaps, put you on &s;uch di&s;agreeable Ser|vice again.&mdash;Now, therefore, be you once more Bed-fellows and Board-fellows, as I may &s;ay, for &s;ome Days longer; and &s;ee that <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;ends no Letters nor Me&s;&s;ages out of the Hou&s;e, nor keeps a Corre&s;pondence unknown to me, e&s;pecially with that <HI>Williams</HI>; and, as for the re&s;t, &s;hew the dear Girl all the Re&s;pect that is due to one I mu&s;t love, if &s;he will de&s;erve it, as I hope &s;he will yet; and let her be under no unnece&s;&s;ary or har&s;h Re&s;traints. But your watchful Care is not, however, to cea&s;e: And re|member, that you are not to di&s;oblige me, to oblige her; and that I will not, cannot, yet part with her.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="318">Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> look'd very &s;ullen, and as if &s;he would be glad &s;till to do me a good Turn, if it lay in her Power.</P>
<P>I took Courage then to drop a Word or two for poor Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>; but he was angry with me for it, and &s;aid, he could not endure to hear his Name in <HI>my</HI> Mouth; &s;o I was forc'd to have done for that time.</P>
<P>All this time my Papers that I had bury'd under the Ro&s;e-bu&s;h, lay there &s;till; and I begg'd for Leave to &s;end a Letter to you. So I &s;hould, he &s;aid, if he might read it fir&s;t. But this did not an&s;wer my De|&s;ign; and yet I would have &s;ent you &s;uch a Letter as he might &s;ee, if I had been &s;ure my Danger was over. But that I cannot; for he now &s;eems to take another Method, and what I am more afraid of, be|cau&s;e, may-be, he may watch an Opportunity, and join Force with it, on Occa&s;ion, when I am lea&s;t prepar'd: For now he &s;eems to abound with Kind|ne&s;s, and talks of Love without Re&s;erve, and makes nothing of allowing him&s;elf in the Liberty of ki&s;&s;ing me, which he calls innocent; but which I do not like, and e&s;pecially in the manner he does it: but for a Ma&s;ter to do it at all to a Servant, has Mean|ing too much in it, not to alarm an hone&s;t Body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY Morning.</HEAD>
<P>I Find I am watched and &s;u&s;pected &s;till very clo&s;e: and I wi&s;h I was with you; but that mu&s;t not be, it &s;eems, this Fortnight. I don't like this Fortnight, and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me, I doubt.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter ju&s;t now &s;ent for me down to take a Walk with him in the Garden. But I like him not at all, nor his Ways. For he would have all the
<PB N="280" REF="319">
way his Arm about my Wai&s;t, and &s;aid abundance of fond Things to me, enough to make me proud, if his De&s;ign had not been apparent. After walking about, he led me into a little Alcove, on the further Part of the Garden; and really made me afraid of my&s;elf. For he began to be very tiezing, and made me &s;it on his Knee, and was &s;o often ki&s;&s;ing me, that I &s;aid, Sir, I don't like to be here at all, I a&s;&s;ure you. Indeed you make me afraid!&mdash;And what made me the more &s;o, was what he once &s;aid to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> and did not think I heard him, and which, tho' always uppermo&s;t with me, I did not mention before, becau&s;e I did not know how to bring it in, in my Writing.</P>
<P>She, I &s;uppo&s;e, had been encouraging him in his Wickedne&s;s; for it was before the la&s;t dreadful Trial; and I only heard what he an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>Said he, I will try <HI>once</HI> more; but I have begun wrong. For I &s;ee Terror does but add to her Fro&s;t; but &s;he is a charming Girl, and may be thaw'd by Kindne&s;s; and I &s;hould have melted her by Love, in&s;tead of freezing her by Fear.</P>
<P>Is he not a wicked &s;ad Man for this?&mdash;To be &s;ure, I blu&s;h while I write it. But I tru&s;t, that that God who has deliver'd me from the Paw of the Lion and the Bear; that is, his and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s Violences; will al&s;o deliver me from this <HI>Phili&s;tine,</HI> my&s;elf, and my own Infirmities, that I may not <HI>defy the Commands of the Living God!</HI></P>
<P>But, as I was &s;aying, this Expre&s;&s;ion coming into my Thoughts, I was of Opinion, I could not be too much on my Guard, at all times; more e&s;pecially when he took &s;uch Liberties: For he profe&s;&s;ed Ho|nour all the Time with his Mouth, while his Actions did not corre&s;pond. I begg'd and pray'd he would let me go; And had I not appear'd quite regardle&s;s
<PB N="281" REF="320">
of all he &s;aid, and re&s;olved not to &s;tay, if I could help it, I know not how far he would have pro|ceeded: For I was forced to fall down upon my Knees.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he walk'd out with me, &s;till bragging of his Honour, and his Love. Yes, yes, Sir, &s;aid I, your Honour is to de&s;troy mine; and your Love is to ruin me, I &s;ee it too plainly. But, indeed, I will not walk with you, Sir, &s;aid I, any more. Do you know, &s;aid he, whom you talk to, and where you are?</P>
<P>You may believe I had Rea&s;on to think him not &s;o decent as he &s;hould be; for I &s;aid, As to where I am, Sir, I know it too well, and that I have no Creature to befriend me: And, as to who you are, Sir, let me a&s;k you, what you would have me an&s;wer?</P>
<P>Why tell me, &s;aid he, What An&s;wer you would make? It will only make you angry, &s;aid I; and &s;o I &s;hall fare wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible. I won't be angry, &s;aid he. Why then, Sir, &s;aid I, you cannot be my late good Lady's Son; for &s;he lov'd me, and taught me Virtue. You cannot then be my Ma&s;ter; for no Ma&s;ter demeans him&s;elf &s;o to his poor Servant.</P>
<P>He put his Arm round me, and his other Hand on my Neck; which made me more angry and bold; and he &s;aid, What then am I? Why, &s;aid I, (&s;truggling from him, and in a great Pa&s;&s;ion) to be &s;ure you are <HI>Lucifer</HI> him&s;elf in the <HI>Shape</HI> of my Ma&s;ter, or you could not u&s;e me thus. The&s;e are too great Liberties, &s;aid he, in Anger, and I de&s;ire that you will not repeat them, for your own &s;ake: For if you have no Decency towards <HI>me,</HI> I'll have none to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>I was running from him; and he &s;aid, Come back, when I bid you.&mdash;So, knowing every Place was alike dangerous to me, and I had nobody to run to,
<PB N="282" REF="321">
I came back, at his Call, and &s;eeing him look di&s;|plea&s;ed, I held my Hands together, and wept, and &s;aid, Pray, Sir, forgive me. No, &s;aid he, rather &s;ay, Pray, <HI>Lucifer,</HI> forgive me; and now, &s;ince you take me for the Devil, how can you expect any Good from me?&mdash;How, rather, can you expect any thing but the wor&s;t Treatment from me?&mdash;You have given me a Character, <HI>Pamela,</HI> and blame me not that I act up to it.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, let me beg you to forgive me. I am really &s;orry for my Boldne&s;s; but indeed you don't u&s;e me like a Gentleman; and how can I expre&s;s my Re&s;entment, if I mince the Matter, while you are &s;o indecent?</P>
<P>Preci&s;e Fool! &s;aid he, what Indecencies have I offer'd you?&mdash;I was bewitch'd I had not gone thro' my Purpo&s;e la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> Night; and then your licen|tious Tongue had not given the wor&s;t Name to little puny Freedoms, that &s;hew my Love and my Folly at the &s;ame time. But begone, &s;aid he, taking my Hand, and to&s;&s;ing it from him, and learn another Conduct, and more Wit; and I will lay a&s;ide my fooli&s;h Regard for you, and a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf. Begone, &s;aid he, again, with a haughty Air.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I cannot go, till you pardon me, which I beg on my bended Knees. I am truly &s;orry for my Boldne&s;s.&mdash;But I &s;ee how you go on: You creep by little and little upon me; and now &s;ooth me, and now threaten me; and if I &s;hould for|bear to &s;hew my Re&s;entment, when you offer In|civilities to me, would not that be to be lo&s;t by degrees? Would it not &s;hew, that I could bear any thing from you, if I did not expre&s;s all the Indig|nation I <HI>could</HI> expre&s;s, at the fir&s;t Approaches you make to what I dread? And, have you not as good as avow'd my Ruin?&mdash;And have you once made me hope, you will quit your Purpo&s;es again&s;t me?
<PB N="283" REF="322">
How then, Sir, can I act, but by &s;hewing my Ab|horrence of every Step that makes towards my Un|doing? And what is left me but Words?&mdash;And can the&s;e Words be other than &s;uch &s;trong ones, as &s;hall &s;hew the Dete&s;tation, which, from the Bottom of my Heart, I have for every Attempt upon my Virtue? Judge for me, Sir, and pardon me.</P>
<P>Pardon you! &s;aid he, what! when you don't re|pent?&mdash;When you have the Boldne&s;s to ju&s;tify your&s;elf in your Fault? Why don't you &s;ay, you never will again offend me? I will endeavour, Sir, &s;aid I, always to pre&s;erve that Decency towards you which becomes me. But really, Sir, I mu&s;t beg your Excu&s;e for &s;aying, That when you forget what belongs to Decency in your Actions, and when Words are all that are left me, to &s;hew my Re|&s;entment of &s;uch Actions, I will not promi&s;e to for|bear the &s;tronge&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions that my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mind &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t to me; nor &s;hall your angrie&s;t Frowns deter me, when my Hone&s;ty is in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>What then, &s;aid he, do you beg Pardon for? Where is the Promi&s;e of Amendment, for which I &s;hould forgive you? Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I own that mu&s;t ab&s;olutely depend on your U&s;age of me: For I will bear any thing you can inflict upon me with Patience, even to the laying down of my Life, to &s;hew my Obedience to you in other Ca&s;es; but I cannot be patient, I cannot be pa&s;&s;ive, when my Virtue is at Stake!&mdash;It would be criminal in me, if I was.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he never &s;aw &s;uch a Fool in his Life! And he walk'd by the Side of me &s;ome Yards, without &s;aying a Word, and &s;eem'd vex'd; and, at la&s;t walked in, bidding me attend him in the Garden after Dinner. So having a little Time, I went up, and wrote thus far.</P>

<P>After my Ma&s;ter had din'd, he took a Turn into the Stables, to look at his Stud of Hor&s;es; and, when he came in, he open'd the Parlour-door, where Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> and I &s;at at Dinner; and, at his Entrance, we both ro&s;e up; but he &s;aid, Sit &s;till, &s;it &s;till; and let me &s;ee how you eat your Victuals, <HI>Pa|mela.</HI> O, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> very poorly, Sir, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. No, &s;aid I, pretty well, Sir, <HI>con&s;idering.</HI> None of your <HI>Con&s;iderings!</HI> &s;aid he,Pretty face; and tapp'd me on the Cheek. I blu&s;h'd, but was glad he was &s;o good-humour'd; but I could not tell how to &s;it before him, nor to behave my&s;elf. So he &s;aid, I know, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you are a nice Carver: My Mo|ther u&s;ed to &s;ay &s;o. My Lady, Sir, &s;aid I, was very good to me, in every thing, and would always make me do the Honours of her Table for her, when &s;he was with her few &s;elect Friends that &s;he lov'd. Cut up, &s;aid he, that Chicken. I did &s;o. Now, &s;aid he, and took a Knife and Fork, and put a Wing upon my Plate, let me &s;ee you eat that. O Sir, &s;aid I, I have eat a whole Brea&s;t of a Chicken already, and cannot eat &s;o much. But he &s;aid, I mu&s;t eat it for his &s;ake, and he would learn me to eat heartily: So I did eat it; but was much confu&s;ed at his &s;o kind and unu&s;ual Freedom and Conde&s;cen&s;ion. And,
<PB N="285" REF="324">
good Sirs! you can't imagine how Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> look'd, and &s;tar'd, and how re&s;pectful &s;he &s;eem'd to me, and call'd me <HI>good Madam,</HI> I'll a&s;&s;ure you! urging me to take a little Bit of Tart.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter took two or three Turns about the Room, mu&s;ing and thoughtful, as I had never be|fore &s;een him; and at la&s;t he went out, &s;aying, I am going into the Garden: You know, <HI>Pamela,</HI> what I &s;aid to you before Dinner. I ro&s;e and curt'&s;y'd, &s;aying, I would attend his Honour; and he &s;aid. Do, good Girl!</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> I &s;ee how things will go. O <HI>Madam,</HI> as &s;he call'd me again, I am &s;ure you are to be our Mi&s;tre&s;s! And then I know what will be|come of me. Ah! Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> &s;aid I, if I can but keep my&s;elf virtuous, 'tis the mo&s;t of my Ambition; and, I hope, no Temptation &s;hall make me other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothwith&s;tanding I had no Rea&s;on to be pleas'd with his Treatment of me before Dinner, yet I made ha&s;te to attend him; and I found him walking by the Side of that Pond, which, for want of Grace, and thro' a &s;inful De&s;pondence, had like to have been &s;o fatal to me, and the Sight of which, ever &s;ince, has been a Trouble and Reproach to me. And it was by the Side of this Pond, and not far from the Place where I had that dreadful Conflict, that my pre&s;ent Hopes, if I am not to be deceiv'd again, began to dawn; which I pre&s;ume to flatter my&s;elf with being an happy Omen for me, as if God Almighty would &s;hew your poor &s;inful Daughter, how well I did, to put my Affiance in his Goodne&s;s, and not to throw away my&s;elf, becau&s;e my Ruin &s;eem'd inevitable to my &s;hort-&s;ighted Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>So he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I am glad you are come of your own Accord, as I may &s;ay: Give me your Hand, I did &s;o; and he look'd at
<PB N="286" REF="325">
me very &s;teadily, and pre&s;&s;ing my Hand all the time, at la&s;t &s;aid, I will now talk to you in a &s;erious manner.</P>
<P>You have a great deal of Wit, a great deal of Penetration, much beyond your <HI>Years</HI>; and, as I thought, your <HI>Opportunities.</HI> You are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an open, frank and generous Mind; and a Per&s;on &s;o lovely, that you excel all your Sex, in my Eyes. All the&s;e Accompli&s;hments have engag'd my Affections &s;o deeply, that as I have often &s;aid, I cannot live with|out you; and I would divide, with all my Soul, my E&s;tate with you, to make you mine upon my own Terms. The&s;e you have ab&s;olutely rejected; and that, tho' in &s;aucy Terms enough, yet, in &s;uch a manner, as makes me admire you more. Your pretty Chit-chat to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> the la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> Night, &s;o innocent, and &s;o full of beautiful Simpli|city, half di&s;armed my Re&s;olutions before I approach'd your Bed. And I &s;ee you &s;o watchful over your Vir|tue, that, tho' I hop'd to find it otherwi&s;e, I cannot but &s;ay, my Pa&s;&s;ion for you is increas'd by it. But now what &s;hall I &s;ay further, <HI>Pamela?</HI>&mdash;I will make you, tho' a Party, my Advi&s;er in this Matter; tho' not perhaps my definitive Judge.</P>
<P>You know I am not a very abandon'd Profligate: I have hitherto been guilty of no <HI>very</HI> enormous or vile Actions. This of &s;eizing you, and confining you thus, may, perhaps, be one of the wor&s;t, at lea&s;t to Per&s;ons of real Innocence. Had I been utterly given up to my Pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould before now have gratify'd them, and not have &s;hewn that Remor&s;e and Compa&s;&s;ion for you, which have repriev'd you more than once, when ab&s;olutely in my Power; and you are as inviolate a Virgin as you were when you came into my Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But, what can I do? Con&s;ider the Pride of my Condition, I cannot endure the Thought of Mar|riage,
<PB N="287" REF="326">
even with a Per&s;on of equal or &s;uperior Degree to my&s;elf; and have declin'd &s;everal Pro|po&s;als of that kind: How then, with the Di&s;tance between us, and in the World's Judgment, can I think of making you my Wife? &mdash;Yet I mu&s;t have you; I cannot bear the Thoughts of any other Man &s;upplanting me in your Affections. And the very Apprehen&s;ion of that has made me hate the Name of <HI>Williams,</HI> and u&s;e him in a manner unworthy of my Temper.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> judge for me; and, &s;ince I have told you thus candidly my Mind, and I &s;ee yours is big with &s;ome important Meaning, by your Eyes, your Blu&s;hes, and that &s;weet Confu&s;ion which I be|hold &s;truggling in your Bo&s;om, tell me with like Openne&s;s and Candour, what you think I ought to do, and what you would have me do.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s the Agitations of my Mind on this unexpected Declaration, &s;o con|trary to his former Behaviour. His Manner, too, had &s;omething &s;o noble, and &s;o &s;incere, as I thought; that, alas for me! I found I had Need of all my poor Di&s;cretion, to ward off the Blow which this Treatment gave to my mo&s;t guarded Thoughts. I threw my&s;elf at his Feet; for I trembled, and could hardly &s;tand: O Sir, &s;aid I, &s;pare your poor Servant's Confu&s;ion! O &s;pare the poor <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash;Speak out, &s;aid he, and tell me what I bid you, What you think I ought to do? I cannot &s;ay what you <HI>ought</HI> to do, an&s;wer'd I: But I only beg you will not ruin me; and, if you think me virtuous, if you think me &s;incerely hone&s;t, let me go to my poor Parents. I will vow to you, that I will never &s;uffer my&s;elf to be engag'd without your Approbation.</P>
<P>Still he in&s;i&s;ted upon a more explicit An&s;wer to his Que&s;tion, of what I thought he ought to do. And I &s;aid, As to <HI>my</HI> poor Thoughts, of what you
<PB N="288" REF="327">
ought to do, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that, indeed, I think you ought to regard the World's Opinion, and avoid doing any thing di&s;graceful to your Birth and Fortune; and therefore, if you really honour the poor <HI>Pamela</HI> with your Re&s;pect, a little Time, Ab&s;ence, and the Conver&s;ation of worthier Per&s;ons of my Sex, will effectually enable you to overcome a Regard &s;o unworthy of your Condition: And this, good Sir, is the be&s;t Advice I can offer.</P>
<P>Charming Creature! lovely <HI>Pamela!</HI> &s;aid he, (with an Ardor, that was never before &s;o agreeable to me) this generous Manner is of a Piece with all the re&s;t of your Conduct. But tell me &s;till more explicitly, what you would advi&s;e me to in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid I, take not Advantage of my Credulity, and the&s;e my weak Moments; but, were I the fir&s;t Lady in the Land, in&s;tead of the poor abject <HI>Pa|mela,</HI> I would, I <HI>could</HI> tell you. But I can &s;ay no more&mdash;</P>
<P>O my dear Father and Mother! now I know you will indeed be concern'd for me;&mdash;for now I am for my&s;elf:&mdash;And now I begin to be afraid, I know too well the Rea&s;on, why all his hard Trials of me, and my black Apprehen&s;ions, would not let me hate him.</P>
<P>But be a&s;&s;ur'd &s;till, by God's Grace, that I &s;hall do nothing unworthy of your <HI>Pamela</HI>; and if I find that he is &s;till capable of deceiving me, and that this Conduct is only put on to delude me more, I &s;hall think nothing in this World &s;o vile and &s;o odious; and nothing, if he be not the wor&s;t of his Kind, (as he &s;ays, and, I hope, he is not) &s;o de&s;perately guileful as the Heart of Man.</P>
<P>He generou&s;ly &s;aid, I will &s;pare your Confu&s;ion, <HI>Pamela.</HI> But I hope, I may promi&s;e my&s;elf, that you can love me preferably to any other Man; and that no one in the World has had any Share in your
<PB N="289" REF="328">
Affections; for I am very jealous of what I love, and if I thought you had a &s;ecret Whi&s;pering in your Soul, that had not yet come up to a Wi&s;h, for any other Man breathing, I &s;hould not forgive <HI>my|&s;elf</HI> to per&s;i&s;t in my Affection for you; nor <HI>you,</HI> if you did not frankly acquaint me with it.</P>
<P>As I &s;till continued on my Knees, on the Gra&s;s Slope by the Pond-&s;ide, he &s;at him&s;elf down on the Gra&s;s by me, and took me in his Arms, Why he|&s;itates my <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he? &mdash; Can you not an&s;wer me with Truth, as I wi&s;h? If you cannot, &s;peak, and I will forgive you.</P>
<P>O, good Sir, &s;aid I, it is not <HI>that</HI>; indeed it is not: But a frightful Word or two that you &s;aid to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> when you thought I was not in hearing, comes cro&s;s my Mind; and makes me dread, that I am in more Danger than ever I was in my Life.</P>
<P>You have never found me a common Liar, &s;aid he, (too fearful and fooli&s;h <HI>Pamela!</HI>) nor will I an&s;wer how long I may hold in my pre&s;ent Mind; for my Pride &s;truggles hard within me, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; and if you doubt me, I have no Obligation to your Confidence or Opinion. But at pre&s;ent, I am really &s;incere in what I &s;ay: And I expect you will be &s;o too; and an&s;wer directly my Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I find Sir, &s;aid I, I know not my&s;elf; and your Que&s;tion is of &s;uch a Nature, that I only want to tell you what I heard, and to have your kind An&s;wer to it; or el&s;e, what I have to &s;ay to your Que&s;tion, may pave the Way to my Ruin, and &s;hew a Weakne&s;s that I did not believe was in me.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, you may &s;ay what you have over-heard; for, in nor an&s;wering me directly, you put my Soul upon the Rack; and half the Trouble I have
<PB N="290" REF="329">
had with <HI>you,</HI> would have brought to my Arms the fine&s;t Lady in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid I, my Virtue is as dear to me, as if I was of the highe&s;t Quality; and my Doubts (for which you know I have had too much Rea&s;on) have made me trouble&s;ome. But now, Sir, I will tell you what I heard, which has given me great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>You talked to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> of having begun wrong with me, in trying to &s;ubdue me with Terror, and of Fro&s;t, and &s;uch-like;&mdash; you remember it well:&mdash; and that you would, for the future, change your Con|duct, and try to <HI>melt</HI> me, that was your Word, by Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I fear not, Sir, the Grace of God &s;upporting me, that any Acts of Kindne&s;s would make me forget what I owe to my Virtue; but, Sir, I may, I find, be made more mi&s;erable by &s;uch Acts, than by Ter|ror; becau&s;e my Nature is too frank and open to make me wi&s;h to be ingrateful; and if I &s;hould be taught a Le&s;&s;on I never yet learnt, with what Re|gret &s;hould I de&s;cend to the Grave, to think, that I could not hate my Undoer? And, that, at the la&s;t great Day, I mu&s;t &s;tand up as an Accu&s;er of the poor unhappy Soul, that I could wi&s;h it in my Power to &s;ave!</P>
<P>Exalted Girl, &s;aid he, what a Thought is that! &mdash; Why now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you excel your &s;elf! You have given me a Hint that will hold me long. But, &s;weet Creature, &s;aid he, tell me what is this Le&s;&s;on, which you never yet learnt, and which you are &s;o afraid of learning?</P>
<P>If, Sir, &s;aid I, you will again generou&s;ly &s;pare my Confu&s;ion, I need not &s;ay it: But <HI>this</HI> I will &s;ay, in An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion you &s;eem mo&s;t &s;olicitous about, That I know not the Man breathing that I
<PB N="291" REF="330">
would wi&s;h to be marry'd to, or that ever I thought of with &s;uch a Hope. I had brought my Mind &s;o to love Poverty, that I hop'd for nothing but to return to the be&s;t, tho' the poore&s;t, of Parents; and to employ my&s;elf in &s;erving God, and comforting them; and you know not, Sir, how you di&s;ap|pointed my Hopes, and my propo&s;ed hone&s;t Plea|&s;ures, when you &s;ent me hither.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid he, I may promi&s;e my&s;elf, that neither the Par&s;on, nor any other Man, is any the lea&s;t &s;ecret Motive to your &s;tedfa&s;t Refu&s;al of my Offers? Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, you may; and, as you was plea&s;ed to ask, I an&s;wer, that I have not the lea&s;t Shadow of a Wi&s;h, or Thought, for any Man living.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid he; for I am fooli&s;hly jealous, and yet it &s;hews my Fondne&s;s for you; have you not en|courag'd <HI>Williams</HI> to think you will have him? In|deed, Sir, &s;aid I, I have not; but the very contrary. And would you not have had him, &s;aid he, if you had got away by his Means? I had re&s;olv'd, Sir, &s;aid I, in my Mind otherwi&s;e; and he knew it, and the poor Man &mdash; I charge you, &s;aid he, &s;ay not a Word in his Favour! You will excite a Whirlwind in my Soul, if you name him with Kindne&s;s, and then you'll be borne away with the Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, I have done! &mdash; Nay, &s;aid he, but do not have done; let me know the whole. If you have any Regard for him, &s;peak out; for, it would end fearfully for <HI>you,</HI> for <HI>me,</HI> and for <HI>him,</HI> if I found, that you di&s;guis'd any Secret of your Soul from me, in this nice Particular.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, if I have ever given you Cau&s;e to think me &s;incere &mdash; Say then, &s;aid he, interrupting me, with great Vehemence; and taking both my Hands between his, Say, That you now, in the Pre&s;ence
<PB N="292" REF="331">
of God, declare, that you have not any the mo&s;t hidden Regard for <HI>Williams,</HI> or any other Man.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, I do. As God &s;hall ble&s;s me, and pre&s;erve my Innocence, I have not. Well, &s;aid he, I will believe you, <HI>Pamela</HI>; and in time, perhaps, I may better bear that Man's Name. And, if I am convinc'd that you are not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, my Vanity makes me a&s;&s;ur'd, that I need not to fear a Place in your E&s;teem, equal, if not preferable to any Man in <HI>England.</HI> But yet it &s;tings my Pride to the quick, that you was &s;o ea&s;ily brought, and at &s;uch a &s;hort Acquaintance, to run away with that College No|vice!</P>
<P>O good Sir, &s;aid I, may I be heard one Thing, and tho' I bring upon me your highe&s;t Indignation, I will tell you, perhaps the unnece&s;&s;ary and impru|dent, but yet, the whole Truth.</P>
<P>My Hone&s;ty (I am poor and lowly, and am not intitled to call it <HI>Honour</HI>) was in Danger. I &s;aw no Means of &s;ecuring my&s;elf from your avow'd At|tempts. You had &s;hew'd you would not &s;tick at little Matters; and what, Sir, could any body have thought of my Sincerity, in preferring that to all other Con&s;iderations, if I had not e&s;cap'd from the&s;e Dangers, if I could have found any way for it? &mdash; I am not going to &s;ay any thing for him; but indeed, indeed, Sir, I was the Cau&s;e of putting him upon a&s;&s;i&s;ting me in my E&s;cape. I got him to acquaint me, what Gentry there were in the Neighbourhood, that I might fly to; and prevail'd upon him; &mdash; Don't frown at me, good Sir, for I mu&s;t tell you the whole Truth! &mdash; to apply to one Lady <HI>Jones</HI>; to Lady <HI>Darnford</HI>; and he was &s;o good to apply to Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> the Mini&s;ter: but they all refus'd me; and then it was he let me know, that there was no honourable Way but Marriage.
<PB N="293" REF="332">
That I declin'd; and he agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me for God's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid he, you are going &mdash; I boldly put my Hand before his Mouth, hardly knowing the Liberty I took; Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, don't be angry; I have ju&s;t done &mdash; I would only &s;ay, That rather than have &s;taid to be ruin'd, I would have thrown my&s;elf upon the poore&s;t Beggar that ever the World &s;aw, if I thought him hone&s;t. &mdash; And I hope, when you duly weigh all Matters, you will forgive me, and not think me &s;o bold and &s;o forward as you have been pleas'd to call me.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, even in this your la&s;t Speech, which, let me tell you, &s;hews more your Hone&s;ty of Heart, than your Prudence, you have not overmuch pleas'd me. But I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love you; and that vexes me not a little. But tell me, <HI>Pamela</HI>; for now the former Que&s;tion recurs; Since you &s;o much prize your Ho|nour and your Virtue; &s;ince all Attempts again&s;t that are &s;o odious to you; and, &s;ince I have avow|edly made &s;everal of the&s;e Attempts, do you think it is po&s;&s;ible for you to love me <HI>preferably</HI> to any other of my Sex?</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, &s;aid I, and here my Doubt recurs, that you may thus graciou&s;ly u&s;e me, to take Advan|tage of my Credulity.</P>
<P><HI>Still</HI> perver&s;e and doubting, &s;aid he! Cannot you take me as I am at pre&s;ent; and that, I have told you, is &s;incere and unde&s;igning, whatever I may be hereafter? &mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, reply'd I, what can I &s;ay? &mdash; I have already &s;aid too much, if this dreadful <HI>Hereafter</HI> &s;hould take place. Don't bid me &s;ay how well I can &mdash; And then, my Face, glowing as the Fire, I, all aba&s;h'd, lean'd upon his Shoulder, to hide my Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="333">He cla&s;p'd me to him with great Ardour, and &s;aid, Hide your dear Face in my Bo&s;om, my beloved <HI>Pamela</HI>; your innocent Freedoms charm me!&mdash;But then &s;ay, How well&mdash;what?</P>
<P>If you will be good, &s;aid I, to your poor Servant, and &s;pare her, I cannot &s;ay too much! But if not, I am doubly undone!&mdash;Undone indeed!</P>
<P>Said he, I hope my pre&s;ent Temper will hold; for I tell you frankly, that I have known in this agreeable Hour more &s;incere Plea&s;ure, than I have experienc'd in all the guilty Tumults that my de&s;iring Soul put me into, in the Hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you on my own Terms. And, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you mu&s;t pray for the Continuance of this Temper; and I hope your Prayers will get the better of my Temptations.</P>
<P>This &s;weet Goodne&s;s overpower'd all my Re&s;erves. I threw my&s;elf at his Feet, and embrac'd his Knees: What Plea&s;ure, Sir, you give me, at the&s;e gracious Words, is not lent your poor Servant to expre&s;s!&mdash; I &s;hall be too much rewarded for all my Sufferings, if this Goodne&s;s hold! God grant it may, for your own Soul's &s;ake, as well as mine. And Oh! how happy &s;hould I be, if&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt me, and &s;aid, But, my dear Girl, what mu&s;t we do about the World, and the World's Cen|&s;ure? &mdash;Indeed, I cannot marry!</P>
<P>Now was I again &s;truck all of a Heap. However, &s;oon recollecting my&s;elf, Sir, &s;aid I, I have not the Pre&s;umption to hope &s;uch an Honour. If I may be permitted to return in Peace and Safety to my poor Parents, to pray for you there; it is all I at pre&s;ent reque&s;t! This, Sir, after all my Apprehen&s;ions and Dangers, will be a great Plea&s;ure to me. And, if I know my own poor Heart, I &s;hall wi&s;h you happy in a Lady of &s;uitable Degree: And rejoice mo&s;t &s;incerely in every Circum&s;tance that &s;hall make for

the Happine&s;s of my late good Lady's mo&s;t be|loved Son!</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, this Conver&s;ation, <HI>Pamela,</HI> is gone farther than I intended it. You need not be afraid, at this rate, of tru&s;ting your&s;elf with <HI>me:</HI> But it is I, that ought to be doubtful of my&s;elf, when I am with <HI>you.</HI>&mdash;But, before I &s;ay any thing further on this Subject, I will take my proud Heart to Task; and, till then, let every thing be, as if this Con|ver&s;ation had never pa&s;s'd. Only, let me tell you, that the more Confidence you place in me, the more you'll oblige me: But your Doubts will only beget <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of Doubts. And with this ambiguous Saying, he &s;aluted me in a more formal manner, if I may &s;o &s;ay, than before, and lent me his Hand, and &s;o we walk'd towards the Hou&s;e, Side-by-&s;ide, he &s;eeming very thoughtful and pen&s;ive, as if he had already repented him of his Goodne&s;s.</P>
