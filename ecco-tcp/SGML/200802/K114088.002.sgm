<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of the Air, and &s;ome of its Properties.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING ju&s;t calculated the re|&s;i&s;tance given by the air to bodies in motion, this naturally leads us to con&s;ider the nature and properties of the air it&s;elf. It was the method with the natural philo&s;ophers that ju&s;t &s;ucceeded the ages of ob&s;curity to divide the &s;ubject
<PB N="2" REF="9">
of their inve&s;tigation into as many parts as they &s;uppo&s;ed there were elements; namely, earth, air, water, fire. We know nothing of the elements of which bodies are compo&s;ed; but as there is nothing ab&s;urd in the order they have u&s;ed, and as the parts will be more ea&s;ily explained thus, we beg leave to adopt a method, which, though le&s;s modern, will be found more per&s;picuous.</P>
<P>A GREEK philo&s;opher, when &s;ome wranglers a&s;ked him for a definition of motion, got up and walked; he &s;hewed them the thing, which was the be&s;t defi|nition he could give. Were we a&s;ked in the &s;ame manner what is air, we &s;hould refer the queri&s;t to his experience alone for information. Animals breathe the air, birds fly upon it, fire burns in it, &s;ounds float in it; in &s;hort, the be&s;t defi|nition of this &s;ub&s;tance is the enume|ration which we are about to give of its properties.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">HOWEVER the form of air may e&s;cape our &s;ight, yet its &s;ub&s;tance &s;trikes all the re&s;t of our &s;en&s;es; the bladder when filled with air is very different from the &s;ame when empty, and then re&s;i&s;ts pre&s;|&s;ure with great force. All places on the &s;urface of the earth are replete with air, we find it in the bottom of the deepe&s;t caverns, and upon the tops of the highe&s;t mountains.</P>
<P>IT was the opinion of Boyle that all bodies what&s;oever had an atmo&s;phere or a thin fluid &s;ub&s;tance peculiar to them|&s;elves and floating round them; he &s;hewed that the diamond had its atmo|&s;phere, the load&s;tone another. The ro&s;e we &s;ee has an atmo&s;phere of odorous parts flying round its &s;urface, the mu&s;k dif|fu&s;es perfume in a very wide atmo&s;phere, while a&s;&s;afaetida diffu&s;es its &s;cent into a &s;phere equally exten&s;ive. The caele&s;tial bodies almo&s;t all of them that we are &s;ufficiently near to examine, have their atmo&s;pheres: when a &s;tar is &s;ometimes
<PB N="4" REF="11">
hid from us behind a planet, we always find as the &s;tar emerges from this tempo|rary eclip&s;e, that the planet's atmo&s;phere hides the &s;tar for a while longer than we had a right to expect its appearance. As all bodies thus have their atmo&s;pheres, &s;o it is but analogous with the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, that the earth al&s;o &s;hould have an atmo&s;phere or a fluid &s;ub&s;tance floating round it filled with par|ticles; and &s;ome have thought that air is nothing more than earth or water ex|panded, and a&s;&s;uming a more &s;ubtil form. The&s;e therefore compared the atmo&s;phere to a large chymical furnace; in this the matter of all &s;ublunary bodies is found floating in great quantities. This great recipient, &s;aid they, is continually expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un's heat, from whence re&s;ults a number of chymical operations, &s;ublimations, &s;eparations, compo&s;itions, dige&s;tions, fermentations, and putrefactions. This &s;ect of philo&s;o|phers &s;uppo&s;ed, and brought experiments to prove, that air could be produced from
<PB N="5" REF="12">
bodies at plea&s;ure, that we could make air from earth or plants by a very ea&s;y proce&s;s, and that air was in fact nothing but the parts of bodies, which, by being changed, became capable of different properties.</P>
<P>TO this purpo&s;e Boyle has related many experiments by which he made air. By making air he meant drawing it in large quantities from &s;everal bodies that &s;eemed unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it before, or at lea&s;t not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch quantities as were extracted by him from them. He ob&s;erves, that the be&s;t methods for accompli&s;hing this are by leaving the bodies to ferment, to putrify, to di&s;&s;olve, or in &s;hort driving them through any proce&s;s that will &s;erve to di&s;unite their parts from each other. He adds, that even many minerals, in the parts of which we could expect to meet no &s;uch fluid as air, have yet afforded much upon being di&s;&s;olved in corroding fluids, &s;uch as aqua fortis, which &s;epa|rates the parts of the metal from each
<PB N="6" REF="13">
other. Hales has made many experi|ments to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. However, after all, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e the air thus made either from vegetables or minerals is the true ela&s;tic air, the properties of which are now under con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ALL that appears air to our &s;en&s;es is not really &s;o, for we can make even water put on, for a time the appearance of air, and yet this water, who&s;e nature &s;eems thus in a manner changed, will, when left to it&s;elf for a &s;hort time, again re&s;ume its natural form, and look like water as before.</P>
<P>THIS is proved by the very ingenious experiment of the Aeolipyle. This in|&s;trument is a copper globular body, in which is in&s;erted a &s;mall neck or pipe (See Fig. 43.) with a very &s;mall orifice, from whence, when filled with water and laid upon the fire, a vapour like wind i&s;&s;ues out with prodigious violence,
<PB N="7" REF="14">
and blows like a tempe&s;t. The way to fill this in&s;trument with water is to &s;et it fir&s;t while empty upon the fire till it is hot, and then with a pair of tongs it mu&s;t be taken off and the pipe held under water till it be filled as much as you think fit. Tho&s;e who have not this in&s;trument it&s;elf, may ea&s;ily make one &s;omething like it with their tea-kettle, only fir&s;t having filled it with water, and then clapping down the lid very clo&s;e, &s;topping it round with loam or any &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance to prevent the &s;team from e&s;|caping any way but by the &s;pout. When this kettle boils, if you hold a candle to the &s;pout you will pre&s;ently &s;ee it blown out with &s;ome violence; and if we could bend down the &s;pout in &s;uch a manner as to blow again&s;t the fire, the kettle would blow the fire under it&s;elf like a pair of bellows. If the water put into the kettle in&s;tead of being &s;imple were perfumed, this would diffu&s;e the odour with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;trength round the room. If a wind in&s;trument were pro|perly
<PB N="8" REF="15">
adapted to this &s;pout, it would make it &s;ound. Such are the effects of water when made to re&s;emble air, but &s;till it is altogether different from real air; for when this vapour is caught by a proper receiver, it quickly conden&s;es in drops to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, and no way differs from common water.</P>
<P>IT is exactly the &s;ame with all other counterfeiting fluids and &s;ub&s;tances as with water; how great &s;o ever the rare|faction, yet they con&s;tantly are found after a time to lo&s;e the properties of air, and to a&s;&s;ume a different appearance. Boyle informs us, that he has drawn an ela&s;tic fluid from &s;everal bodies, from bread, from grapes, from beer, apples, peas, as al&s;o from hart&s;horn and paper. This &s;ub&s;tance had, at the fir&s;t appear|ance, all the properties of air. But upon examining it more clo&s;ely, it was &s;o far from being of the &s;ame nature with pure air, that the animals which were con|fined in it, not only lo&s;t all power of
<PB N="9" REF="16">
breathing in it, but died in it &s;ooner than in a place from whence he had taken out all the air.</P>
<P>FROM this therefore it appears, that there is &s;uch a thing as true air, con|&s;idered as di&s;tinct from vapours, from factitious air, or any other minute &s;ub|&s;tance floating in our atmo&s;phere. It ap|pears that it can neither be converted into other &s;ub&s;tances, nor others converted into it. This real air when &s;hut up in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el remains there continually without any change, and always under the form of air. But it is not &s;o with vapours, or other rarefied &s;ub&s;tances; for as &s;oon as they become cold they lo&s;e all their ela&s;|ticity, and adhere to the &s;ides of the gla&s;s in the form of round drops, while the ve&s;&s;el which in the beginning &s;eemed filled with the vapour, in a manner be|comes quite empty.</P>
<P>ANOTHER property by which this pure air differs from vapours is, that by
<PB N="10" REF="17">
the&s;e we often hinder our breathing, while, without the other, we could not breathe.</P>
<P>IT differs al&s;o from terre&s;trial exha|lations in this, that it remains the &s;ame after great rains and thunder, as it was before them; whereas, if it was only a compound of exhalations, the&s;e when fired off in lightning, or falling with rain, would totally de&s;troy the com|pound, and con&s;equently change the nature of the air; which however is not the ca&s;e, for the air remains unvaried, or, if it receives any change, they leave it more pure.</P>
<P>WE may therefore re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that there is a &s;ub&s;tance called air different from all others, and no way allied to them; but then as to the nature of this &s;ub&s;tance, the parts of which it is com|po&s;ed, the figure of tho&s;e parts, the&s;e are things to which we are utterly &s;trangers; all our opinions upon this head are but
<PB N="11" REF="18">
conjecture. Though rea&s;on &s;erves to a&s;&s;ure us that this pure air mu&s;t exi&s;t, yet we have never had the means of examining it &s;olely and unmixed with other &s;ub|&s;tances. Whatever we breathe, whatever we feel, is but an heterogeneous mixture of different bodies floating in this un|known &s;upporter; and the different noxious or &s;alutary effects a&s;cribed to air belong properly to tho&s;e foreign mixtures with which it is impregnated.</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE has &s;hewn that the air we breathe is a chaos, or an a&s;&s;emblage of all kinds of bodies what&s;oever. What|ever fire can divide floats in the air's bo&s;om, and there is no &s;ub&s;tance, how|ever hard, that fire is not able at length to &s;eparate into fume. Thus, for ex|ample, we meet in the air all the &s;ub&s;tances which belong to the mineral kingdom, as it is called, &s;uch as &s;alts, &s;ulphurs, &s;tones, and metals; the&s;e all by heat can be di&s;&s;ipated into &s;moak, and con&s;e|quently become lighter than the air.
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Even gold it&s;elf, the heavie&s;t of all minerals, is found in the mine often united with quick&s;ilver; and if we at|tempt to convert the quick&s;ilver into fumes over the fire, a part of the gold will ri&s;e into the air with it.</P>
<P>IN the air floats al&s;o all &s;ub&s;tances that belong to the animal kingdom. The copious emanations that continually fly from the bodies of all animals, by per|&s;piration and other means, (thus if an healthy man's arm be put into a gla&s;s ca&s;e, the per&s;piration of the limb will be gathered like a dew upon the &s;urface of the gla&s;s) the&s;e per&s;pirations, I &s;ay, &s;end into the air a greater quantity of the animal's &s;ub&s;tance in the &s;pace of a few months than would make the bulk of the animal it&s;elf. Even after the animal is dead, if expo&s;ed to the air all its fle&s;hy parts will &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated, and in the warme&s;t climates, this is often found to obtain in three or four days.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">THE air is not le&s;s loaded with vegetable per&s;pirations. Doctor Hales has calculated that a &s;ingle &s;un-flower per|&s;pires more than a man, but a full-grown tree per&s;pires in much greater abundance. All the&s;e per&s;pirations go to be mixed in the air. When vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are left to putrefy, they then become perfectly volatile, and make a part of the terre&s;trial atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>THUS is our air &s;aturated with an in|finite variety of &s;ub&s;tances foreign to its own nature; but of all the emanations which float in it, Boyle affirms that &s;alts are found in greate&s;t quantity. Some authors think the nitrous &s;alts abound mo&s;t in air from the frequency of its being found &s;ticking again&s;t old lime-walls, and other &s;ub&s;tances, which &s;eem fitted for drawing it from the air. This has been denied by &s;ome of the moderns, who affirm that the nitre is not in the air, but actually in the wall it&s;elf. How|ever this be, certain it is that the air is
<PB N="14" REF="21">
impregnated with &s;alts of &s;ome kind or another, and perhaps mixed in a manner perfectly conformable to the chymi&s;t's art, for their effects in experiment are as powerful as any &s;alts he can form. Thus the &s;tones of very old buildings are often corroded by the air, and gnawed away in a manner as if it had been done by worms. No unmixed &s;alt in the elaboratories of art could do this. From hence we may gather that the bodies which float in air have not only all the properties of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ingly, but al&s;o a&s;&s;ume new qualities which they are often found to po&s;&s;e&s;s by being mixed together. In the chymi&s;t's elaboratory new and un|expected appearances continually ari&s;e from the mixture of different &s;ub&s;tances together. In the air, the great elabora|tory of nature, more different effects are con&s;tantly produced, for the variety of the &s;ub&s;tances which it mixes together is in|finitely more.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22">THE air then &s;ubjected to &s;en&s;e is a very heterogeneous mixture of various exha|lations, but what is the ba&s;e, the fluid that &s;upports the&s;e, we are unable to di&s;cover. The ancients called it an element, by which they meant one of tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances of which all others are compo&s;ed. Doctor Hooke calls it Ether, or that &s;ubtil matter which is diffu&s;ed every where. It has received &s;everal other appellations, but all this is only calling an unknown thing by different names. The ancients were ignorant of its nature, as well as its properties; the moderns are equally ignorant of its nature, but its properties they have inve&s;tigated with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the mo&s;t obvious Effects of Air upon the Human Body.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY Philo&s;ophy was content with examining Nature as &s;he offered her&s;elf obviou&s;ly to view. Later enquirers have &s;crutinized more clo&s;ely into her &s;ecret workings by the means of experiments. Let us fir&s;t then con&s;ider tho&s;e properties of air which the fir&s;t philo&s;ophers enquired after, and then &s;ee what wonders modern experi|ments have &s;hewn; and thus following nature upon the view, at la&s;t pur&s;ue her into her more &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>AIR, as we &s;aid already, is the prin|cipal in&s;trument of nature in all her productions. If we deprive an animal of air by ob&s;tructing the organs by which they in&s;pire it, the animal will die in a few minutes. If we &s;hould by any other
<PB N="17" REF="24">
means deprive the animal of the free u&s;e of air by &s;hutting it into a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, the air with which it is thus included would &s;oon become unfit for all the purpo&s;es of life, and the animal would die in a few minutes. Air therefore is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of all animals; even fi&s;hes that live in water cannot do without it: if a fi&s;h is put into a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el of water where the external air is excluded, the fi&s;h will &s;oon die for want of fre&s;h air. The fi&s;hes in a pond covered over with ice would die if care were not taken to break the ice, and &s;o let in fre&s;h air upon the &s;urface of the water to fit it for their re&s;piration.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the u&s;es of the air thus in&s;pired by animals, or why it &s;hould be thus nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life, is a que&s;tion philo&s;ophers cannot ea&s;ily re|&s;olve. Some are of opinion that there is a &s;alt in the air, which the lungs of animals continually imbibe as they draw in their breath. This opinion they gathered from the fine &s;carlet colour of
<PB N="18" REF="25">
the blood of the arteries ju&s;t as it came from being mixed with the air in the lungs, and that dull colour in the venal blood which it had before. The &s;carlet colour of the blood, they &s;aid, re&s;embled what a &s;alt would have given it, while the blacki&s;h colour of the blood before it came to the lungs, &s;hewed that it wanted tho&s;e &s;alts which it afterwards received from the air to fit it for the purpo&s;e of animal life. This is not true. There is no more &s;alt in the &s;carlet arterial blood than in the du&s;ky-coloured venal blood; and in fact, none in either, except a part of that &s;alt we eat.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;ect were of opinion that the air was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport animal life, becau&s;e without it the blood could not be driven through the body. For the air, &s;aid they, pre&s;&s;ing down upon the large &s;urface of the blood in the lungs, like the pi&s;ton of a &s;yringe drives it through the tubes appointed for its reception, and &s;o the blood is driven from one tube to
<PB N="19" REF="26">
another through the whole body. This is not true: Becau&s;e the child in his mother's womb has the blood circulating through his whole body, and no air comes to his lungs whatever.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Whytt has given us &s;ome ingenious conjectures upon this &s;ubject. He a&s;cribes much to the irritation of the air upon the internal &s;urface of the lungs, which thus contracting to the touch, drives forward the blood through the re&s;t of the body. After all the&s;e con|jectures, the particular u&s;es of the air in regulating the animal oeconomy, are not yet well known, but even chil|dren are convinced of its utility. We rather know what harm it would do us if taken away, than the good it does us being given.</P>
<P>THE air produces &s;everal effects upon the body in proportion as it is charged with vapours and exhalations. This was well known to Hippocrates, and &s;everal &s;ucceeding phy&s;icians have given us hi&s;|tories
<PB N="20" REF="27">
of tho&s;e di&s;orders which are pro|duced by the badne&s;s of air. An air charged with the particles either of ar&s;enic or quick&s;ilver will &s;oon become fatal. In the quick&s;ilver mines at Idra I have &s;een the workmen in general mi&s;er|ably affected from the nature of the atmo&s;phere in which they were obliged to breathe. The mo&s;t vigorous were in &s;ome mea&s;ure pal&s;ied by working there, and that in a few days; &s;carce any were known to outlive a term of three years con&s;tant re&s;idence at the mine.</P>
<P>THE air when filled with exhalations from animal bodies acquires a pe&s;tilential quality, as it is thought, and the&s;e ex|halations have been known to corrupt quickly; the common baths of the warm countries, in which &s;everal bathe in a morning, if not con&s;tantly changed, would &s;oon grow intolerably offen&s;ive. It has been theoretically alledged, that if a number of men were crowded into a &s;pace of &s;mall extent, the exhalations from their bodies would &s;oon form a
<PB N="21" REF="28">
column of &s;eventy-two feet high, which, if not di&s;&s;ipated by the winds, would become in&s;tantly fatal to one ju&s;t placed in it. Theory fir&s;t a&s;&s;erted this; the number of per&s;ons &s;uffocated at Calcutta &s;hews the theory to have too true a foun|dation. From hence we may infer, that tho&s;e who build or improve cities, &s;hould be very attentive to make the &s;treets &s;uf|ficiently &s;pacious, and not permit their pri&s;ons to be crowded with wretches, who&s;e numbers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily breed infection. It were even to be wi&s;hed, that people ab&s;tained from burying their dead near churches, where there is, or &s;hould be the greate&s;t re&s;ort of the living. Yet, after all, though air that has been too much in&s;pired by man mu&s;t be un|whole&s;ome, yet probably the air, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, acquires an healthful quality by being moderately peopled, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it. The air upon a de&s;olate coa&s;t, however open and dry the &s;oil, is always found dangerous; while univer|&s;ally
<PB N="22" REF="29">
through Europe the mo&s;t populous cities are reckoned the mo&s;t healthful.</P>
<P>IF bra&s;s or copper plates be heated in the fire, and the vapour that a&s;cends from them while thus burning be conveyed by blowing or any other means into a clo&s;e room, animals, in &s;uch air, will be in|&s;tantly de&s;troyed: this is a very con|vincing proof how much mines of copper may prejudice the atmo&s;phere, and de|&s;troy the whole&s;ome qualities of the air.</P>
<P>AIR may be heated by a very ea&s;y experiment; a common pair of bellows, having their end or &s;nout heated red hot, will render the air that is blown through it hotter than the hand can bear. Hot air is reckoned extremely prejudicial to health. It has been &s;aid, that when air acquired a degree of heat greater than the natural heat of animals, which is u&s;ually reckoned to amount to about an hundred degrees by the mo&s;t common thermometer (as we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;hew) then
<PB N="23" REF="30">
it was thought the animal could not live in it. However, this is a mi&s;take; for Mr. Ellis, when in South Carolina, mea|&s;ured the warmth of the air, and found it &s;everal degrees greater than animal heat, yet the inhabitants bore its ex|tremity with health and unconcern. However, it will &s;till hold that when the heat of the air is increa&s;ed to many degrees beyond the warmth of the lungs that breathe in it, it will corrupt the &s;olids and fluids both, and &s;oon bring on death. In a &s;ugar baker's oven, in which the heat was equal to an hundred and forty-&s;ix degrees, that is fifty-four beyond animal heat, a &s;parrow died in two minutes, and a dog in twenty-eight.</P>
<P>COLD in exce&s;s has a very injurious effect al&s;o upon the health of animals, but its malign influence is neither &s;o &s;udden nor &s;o &s;ure as that of heat. Cold contracts the animal fibres &s;o much that
<PB N="24" REF="31">
the &s;ame body mea&s;ured in hot weather and then in cold, will be found to be &s;hrunk in the latter very con&s;iderably. Extreme cold acts on the body like &s;o many &s;mall needles entering its &s;urface, at fir&s;t only producing a &s;light itching, then a &s;mall degree of inflammation, and &s;oon after, if carried to exce&s;s, a total &s;top|page of the circulation. This irritation of cold is felt peculiarly &s;evere upon the &s;urface of the lungs internally, where the thin covering of the parts is ea&s;ily affected. The cold air entering into the lungs would be actually in&s;upportable, but that a part of the warm air, which was left behind in the former expiration, &s;till remains and mixes with the fre&s;h cold air taken in. However, the continual want of per&s;piration, the cold clo&s;ing up the pores of the &s;kin, together with the continual irritation upon the different parts of the body, in a &s;hort time pro|duce the mo&s;t terrible &s;ymptoms. The &s;curvy is the peculiar di&s;order of cold
<PB N="25" REF="32">
countries, a di&s;order which, in the arctic regions, a&s;&s;umes very different appear|ances from tho&s;e which we are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in this temperate climate; the joints immoveable, an ulcerated body, the teeth falling, old wounds received in the former part of life breaking open again, the&s;e and &s;everal &s;uch terrible &s;ymptoms are the con&s;equence of living in an air too cold for the native of a temperate climate to &s;u&s;tain. Such as de&s;ire an hi&s;tory of the fatal &s;ymptoms attending this di&s;order, may con&s;ult Ellis's voyage to Hud&s;on's bay, where they will not only &s;ee the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, but al&s;o the be&s;t methods of preventing it.</P>
<P>AN air too humid produces a relaxation in the fibres of animals and vegetables. The moi&s;ture in&s;inuating it&s;elf through the pores of the body augments its di|men&s;ions. As the &s;tring of a fiddle grows thicker and con&s;equently &s;horter by being moi&s;tened, &s;o do the animal fibres relaxed by too much humidity.
<PB N="26" REF="33">
A per&s;on that &s;wims is more wearied by the relaxation of his fibres by the water, than he is by the fatigue of the exerci&s;e it&s;elf. This relaxation, if continued to any great degree, &s;oon begets a peculiar train of dangerous di&s;orders; agues, drop&s;ies, and pal&s;ies are generally its &s;ure&s;t attendants. In &s;hort, the air and its peculiar qualities have &s;uch an affinity with the human con&s;titution, that it &s;hould be our care to &s;tudy them, if not from rea&s;ons of curio&s;ity, at lea&s;t from motives of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. As humidity is therefore dangerous to the con&s;titution, there has been a method contrived of mea&s;uring the quantity of humidity in the air, that when known we may guard our bodies or chambers again&s;t it. This cheap in&s;trument is called the hygrometer or weather-hou&s;e, which is made merely upon the principle of a piece of cat-gut lengthening in dry weather and contracting in moi&s;t weather.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34">HOW bodies thus with moi&s;ture &s;well and &s;horten is ea&s;ily conceived, for the liquid that enlarges the dimen&s;ion of the fibre one way, will nece&s;&s;arily &s;horten it the other. If I draw a cat-gut or any other cord to a great length between my fingers, I will make it &s;maller than it was before; on the contrary, when I let it go and when it thus becomes thicker, it becomes al&s;o &s;horter. To illu&s;trate this a little more, for the que&s;tion is attended with &s;ome difficulty; and the difficulty is, why the &s;ame moi&s;ture that enlarges the fibres of the cord cro&s;s-wi&s;e does not al&s;o enlarge them length-wi&s;e? In other words, why, as the cord &s;wells, does it not al&s;o lengthen, for &s;uch is the ca&s;e in timber moi&s;tened in water, as Mu&s;chen|brook ju&s;tly ob&s;erves? This que&s;tion has been &s;olved by different methods. The following will &s;uffice. If the cord be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;emble an ela&s;tic tube or gut, and water be forced into it at one end, the fluid pre&s;&s;ing out its &s;ides
<PB N="28" REF="35">
equally every way, its dimen&s;ions cro&s;s|wi&s;e will be encrea&s;ed in a much greater proportion than length-wi&s;e, and as it is protruded with &s;uch exce&s;s cro&s;s-wi&s;e, it mu&s;t con&s;equently grow &s;horter length|wi&s;e to conform to the forcing power. Such a theory may &s;erve for this wonder|ful appearance of the cord's &s;hortening by moi&s;ture; but timber, the fibres of which are more rigid, will not yield &s;o readily to the influx of the fluid, and con&s;equently will not &s;horten in pro|portion as it &s;wells. After all, however, we mu&s;t leave this &s;ubject in ob&s;curity, and what is mo&s;t extraordinary, natura|li&s;ts have in general pa&s;&s;ed it over as an object unworthy their notice. The fact, however, is certain; every day's expe|rience &s;hews us that cords of all kinds contract with humidity, and lengthen when the weather becomes dry. When Trajan's pillar was a &s;econd time reared by Pope Sixtus, we are told that the cords of the machine employed in rai&s;ing it were found too long ju&s;t when the pillar
<PB N="29" REF="36">
was almo&s;t upright. The machini&s;t that directed the whole was at a lo&s;s, till a countryman taught him to &s;horten the cords by the affu&s;ion of water. However true this &s;tory may be, the hygrometer when its cord is &s;hortened will mark the humidity of the air, and when the &s;ame is lengthened it will denote its dry|ne&s;s. The u&s;ual method of making an hygrometer is as follows. Let A B C (See Fig. 44.) be the lower part of a twi&s;ted line or cord hanging from the height of the room again&s;t the wall or wain&s;cot. On the wall let there be de&s;cribed a large circle graduated into an hundred equal parts, &s;uch as KLMN; in the centre of this circle is fixed a pulley turning upon its axis, and bearing an index or hand upon it O P. If now a cord be put round the pulley, and a &s;mall weight or ball &s;u&s;pended at the lower end to keep the cord tight, as the cord gathers moi&s;ture from the air it will become &s;horter, and con&s;equently turn the pulley upward, and the index ri&s;ing
<PB N="30" REF="37">
with it will point higher as the air is more moi&s;t. This is an hygrometer that any per&s;on may make; but an ea&s;ier and &s;till a cheaper I am told may be made by a wild oat-beard, which lengthens with dry weather and contracts with moi&s;ture much more &s;en&s;ibly than any other &s;ub|&s;tance what&s;oever. A very &s;mall &s;hare of ingenuity may form it into a gradu|ated hygrometer, and the &s;impler it is con&s;tructed the better.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the mo&s;t obvious Effects of Air upon mineral and vegetable Sub&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P>THE effects of the air, by which I at pre&s;ent mean that heteroge|neous mixture that floats on our atmo|&s;phere, are &s;till as apparent in the alte|rations produced on &s;ome minerals and vegetables as on man. In fact, it is mo&s;t likely that all natural corruptions and alterations proceed from the air alone; for if we keep the air from either minerals or vegetables by any contri|vance, either by oiling the &s;urfaces of the one, or &s;topping up the others pores clo&s;e; in &s;uch ca&s;es neither will metals ru&s;t, nor vegetables putrefy. If the air is kept from them, they are &s;een neither to en|crea&s;e or dimini&s;h, metals cea&s;e to change, and vegetables to grow or to corrupt.</P>
<P>THOSE metals which the air can pene|trate, &s;uch as iron, lead or copper, are &s;oon
<PB N="32" REF="39">
touched, ru&s;ted, and in a number of years are corroded entirely away. On the tops of high mountains, where the air is not &s;o much impregnated with foreign materials, things are not &s;o apt to change. Words written upon the &s;and or the earth in the&s;e places have been legible forty years after, and appeared no way disfigured or defaced.</P>
<P>BUT though the air, which is a &s;ubtil fluid, penetrates iron or copper after a &s;eries of years, yet in immediate u&s;e the pores of either give it no admi&s;&s;ion. The air will pa&s;s through the pores of lead unle&s;s the metal is fir&s;t hammered upon an anvil. It will not pa&s;s through hard &s;tone, nor wax, nor pitch, nor ro&s;in, nor tallow, the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances effec|tually re&s;i&s;t its admi&s;&s;ion; and if ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be made of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, or lined with them, they would keep the inclo&s;ed air which was blown or driven into them for &s;ome years without lo&s;ing any part of it. After a long &s;eries of
<PB N="33" REF="40">
years, however, the air will eat its way through the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and thus con|trive its own e&s;cape.</P>
<P>THESE keep the air for a long time. There are other &s;ub&s;tances which the air will &s;oon penetrate. It will in&s;inuate it&s;elf through wood, however hard or clo&s;e it may appear. It will pa&s;s through dry parchment, through dry leather, paper, or a bladder turned in&s;ide out; but if the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances be moi&s;tened either with water or oil, they then become air-tight: However, if the air be very much rarified, it will not pa&s;s through all &s;orts of timber; and if the timber be oiled, it will re&s;i&s;t the air better than before. There are but two &s;ub&s;tances that re&s;i&s;t the air, and confine it without being cor|roded by it; namely, gold, and vitreous or gla&s;&s;y bodies, &s;uch as gems of all kinds, and common gla&s;s.</P>
<P>LET us now therefore &s;ee what are the effects of air when it thus in&s;inuates it&s;elf
<PB N="34" REF="41">
into the pores of bodies and mixes it&s;elf with them. We have already &s;aid that the air contained a mixture of different &s;ub&s;tances, &s;alts, metals, &s;ulphurs, and &s;uch-like; the&s;e when uniting with the &s;urfaces of terre&s;trial bodies mu&s;t natu|rally corrode them, as we &s;ee aqua fortis, which is made of a mineral acid, cor|rode iron. It is not le&s;s corroded in the &s;pace of a few years by the acid of the air; and the mo&s;t u&s;ual methods of pre|venting this acid &s;alt from entering its &s;urface, is either to clo&s;e up the pores of the &s;urface by giving the iron the highe&s;t poli&s;h it is capable of bearing, or by oiling it, which will an&s;wer till the oil is evaporated. Boerhaave a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een iron bars &s;o much corroded by the acid of the air, that he could crumble them between his fingers like du&s;t. As for copper it is &s;oon corroded by the air, and covered with a green ru&s;t like verdigrea&s;e, which is no other than the acid of the air mixed with the parts of the metal. As for lead, tin, and
<PB N="35" REF="42">
&s;ilver, they all contract a ru&s;t in like manner. Aco&s;ta informs us, that in Peru the air di&s;&s;olves lead entirely; and we &s;ee our leaden pipes affixed to hou&s;es that have been a long time expo&s;ed, very much injured by the corro&s;ion of the air. Gold is the only metal which we find the air will not ru&s;t or con&s;ume. The only &s;ub&s;tance that con&s;umes gold is &s;ea &s;alt; this &s;alt it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e into the air, or volatilize, as it is called. It is not wonderful therefore that the air can|not con&s;ume or ru&s;t gold, &s;ince it wants the &s;alt adapted for this operation; all other &s;alts are more ea&s;ily volatilized and made to &s;wim in the air, and therefore every other metal finds in the air the &s;alt adapted to corrode it. In elaboratories, however, where aqua regia is made, &s;ea &s;alt is volatilized in &s;ome quantity, and in the&s;e places gold is actually found to ru&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the operations of the chymi&s;t many of the changes of bodies are very diffe|rent, if they be made in a clo&s;e or an
<PB N="36" REF="43">
open air. Thus camphire burnt in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el di&s;&s;olves all into &s;alts; when, on the contrary, if the &s;ame proce&s;s were carried on in the open air, the whole would di&s;&s;ipate into &s;moak. In the &s;ame manner, if &s;ulphur be placed upon an iron plate under a gla&s;s bell, with the edges clo&s;e &s;topped, fire being placed beneath, the &s;ulphur will ri&s;e in &s;pirits round the internal &s;urface of the bell; but if by the &s;malle&s;t opening the air within the bell has a communication with the external air, the &s;ulphur will in&s;tantly take fire, and the whole will be con&s;umed. An ounce of charcoal in|clo&s;ed in a crucible well &s;topped will remain in the fire a whole fortnight without being con&s;umed or lo&s;ing any of its weight; whereas the thou&s;andth part of the &s;ame fire applied to it in open air would have con&s;umed it entirely. Van Helmont adds, that during the whole time the charcoal does not even lo&s;e its blackne&s;s, but upon the air's being intro|duced but for a moment, the whole
<PB N="37" REF="44">
ma&s;s, tho' black before, falls into white a&s;hes. What befalls the charcoal in this experiment, will likewi&s;e be the ca&s;e with all other vegetable or animal &s;ub&s;tances that are burnt in the fire in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el and then immediately expo&s;ed to the air.</P>
<P>THE air, when impregnated with the vapours of a mineral, de&s;troys all &s;ub|&s;tances that &s;uch a mineral would de&s;troy. Thus, in a place where a mineral ore is found in great abundance, the air is im|pregnated with a vitriolic acid that cor|rodes whatever it touches. In London, where there is much coal burnt, and where the air is con&s;equently impreg|nated with &s;ulphur, experiments upon &s;alts are very different from what they are in an air of a different kind le&s;s &s;ul|phureous. For this rea&s;on, the metal uten&s;ils are found not to ru&s;t &s;o &s;oon in London as in &s;ome other parts of the kingdom where wood or turf is the only fire u&s;ed in common. For in the&s;e latter places the air abounds with corroding
<PB N="38" REF="45">
&s;alts, which, in London, are overcome by the fumes of the &s;ulphur; and this may be one rea&s;on among others why that great metropolis is &s;o healthy.</P>
<P>THE influence of the air upon &s;ome &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances is &s;till more apparent than what we have yet mentioned. Many of them, which, when the air is kept away, continue for a long time under the appearance of cry&s;tals, upon its admi&s;&s;ion extract all its humidity, and melt without any other liquid added to them. Some upon the admi&s;&s;ion of the air change their nature, and from what chymi&s;ts call fixed &s;alts become volatile, as, for in&s;tance, &s;alt of tartar, when ex|po&s;ed to an acid air. On the contrary, volatile &s;alts become &s;ometimes fixed.</P>
<P>IN India, where the nitrous &s;alts are found by experience to abound greatly in the air, they dye many colours in much greater perfection than we can in England. In Guinea, the heat, joined with the humidity, cau&s;e &s;uch putre|faction
<PB N="39" REF="46">
in every vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tance, that the be&s;t drugs lo&s;e their virtues in that terrible climate. In the i&s;land of St. Jago belonging to Spain, they are obliged to expo&s;e their bales by day in the &s;un to dry them from the moi&s;ture they have contracted during the night.</P>
<P>WHEN the Dutch, &s;aith Boyle, cut down the clove trees of the i&s;land of Ternati, of which it was full, in order to inhance the price of cloves in Europe, this produced &s;uch a change in the air, that the i&s;land from being extremely healthy, became &s;ickly and unhealthful to an extreme degree. A phy&s;ician who was then upon the &s;pot, a&s;&s;ured Mr. Boyle that the&s;e di&s;orders proceeded from the noxious vapours of a volcano that was upon the i&s;land, and again&s;t which, in all probability, the vapours per&s;pired by the clove tree were an effectual antidote.</P>
<P>THESE and numberle&s;s &s;imilar in|&s;tances might be produced of the power
<PB N="40" REF="47">
of the atmo&s;phere over terre&s;trial bodies. Whatever chymical di&s;&s;olvents can per|form, the atmo&s;phere will be found in time to do the &s;ame. For the terre&s;trial body will attract from the air tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances with which it has the greate&s;t affinity; and as &s;traws are attracted by amber, &s;o will the acid and vapours of the air by &s;ub&s;tances on earth peculiarly adapted to receive them; &s;o that the doctrine of attraction is bound to explain all the chymical changes in nature. The very &s;ea&s;ons are under its influence; whatever alters the heat of the atmo|&s;phere, as we ob&s;erved above, alters al&s;o the nature of the air. By this heating pro|perty, Boyle &s;uppo&s;es that &s;alts and other &s;ub&s;tances are kept liquefied in air, and that being melted together they act con|junctly. He &s;uppo&s;es, that by cold they lo&s;e their fluidity and their motion, that they cry&s;tallize and &s;eparate one from the other, and by their weight hang clo&s;e to the &s;urface of the earth, cling to all &s;ub|&s;tances, and prevent vegetation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Air con&s;idered as a Fluid.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH are the mo&s;t obvious of that heterogeneous a&s;&s;emblage of bodies in our atmo&s;phere; but that fine and perfectly tran&s;parent &s;ub&s;tance the true natural air which &s;upports them, comes next to be taken into con&s;ideration; and its fluidity, or the ea&s;y yielding of its parts, is one of the mo&s;t obvious of its properties. The ea&s;e with which it gives way to the &s;wifte&s;t bodies need &s;carce be mentioned; &s;ounds travel through it with great rapidity, odours and emanations of all kinds find no difficulty in moving forward and pre&s;&s;ing a&s;ide its parts to make way for their own. The&s;e all demon&s;trate the air to be a mo&s;t yielding &s;ub&s;tance which gives way, if not pre|vented, to every impre&s;&s;ion; and this is but another name for fluidity. This
<PB N="42" REF="49">
fluid quality the air never lo&s;es, though it be kept never &s;o long in the clo&s;e&s;t ve&s;&s;els, though it be expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t vici&s;&s;itudes of heat or cold, or though it be pre&s;t together with the ut|mo&s;t violence of human force a&s;&s;i&s;ted by machinery. Still the air continues that yielding fluid it was at fir&s;t; in all the&s;e ca&s;es it was never found that any of its parts became &s;olid, and unbending to the touch, or that they were reduced into any other &s;ub&s;tance different from air. Why the parts of this fluid &s;till retain their u&s;ual form we cannot tell; to un|der&s;tand this would require a knowledge of the figure of the &s;mall parts of air them&s;elves; to under&s;tand this, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know the dimen&s;ions of tho&s;e &s;mall parts, and al&s;o to know their mutual tendency to attract or repell each other. None of the&s;e however are known to us, and therefore the cau&s;e of the air's fluidity mu&s;t &s;till remain a &s;ecret; it is &s;ufficient that we know that it is a fluid, the appearance and not the cau&s;e is all
<PB N="43" REF="50">
that we are permitted to under&s;tand. Carte&s;ius a&s;cribes its fluidity to an inte&s;|tine motion in its parts. But whence ari&s;es the inte&s;tine motion? This motion is even more difficult to be accounted for than fluidity it&s;elf, a greater wonder is therefore &s;uppo&s;ed in order to account for a le&s;s. Boerhaave a&s;cribes the fluidity of the air to the heat of the &s;un, which keeps it in a &s;tate of liquefaction; and he &s;uppo&s;es the whole atmo&s;phere would congeal into one &s;olid ma&s;s if it were not for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;un's fire. This is contrary to experience; no degree of cold can in the lea&s;t alter the air's flu|idity, or unite its parts into the form of the &s;malle&s;t &s;olid: Be&s;ides, on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains where the cold is greate&s;t, the air is (to u&s;e his own ex|pre&s;&s;ion) mo&s;t liquefied. Newton's fol|lowers have attempted to explain the fluidity of the air by means of their great in&s;trument attraction. The parts which con&s;titute the ma&s;s of the air, &s;ay they, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be globular,
<PB N="44" REF="51">
they therefore touch each other in very &s;mall &s;urfaces, as all globes mu&s;t. The attraction between two bodies that touch will be le&s;s in proportion as the &s;urfaces that touch, and the quantities of matter in the touching bodies are little. In the parts of air therefore, as both are ex|tremely &s;mall, the attraction mu&s;t be al&s;o very little, and the parts will con&s;equently be &s;eparated from each other with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. This hypothe&s;is, however, &s;uppo&s;es, what, if denied, can never be proved; namely, that the parts of the air are globular; we do not know of what figure the parts of the air con&s;i&s;t. However, though we do not certainly know the figure of the parts of the air, it is very po&s;&s;ible they are &s;pherical or globular; fir&s;t, becau&s;e bodies that are of that figure roll over each other, and give the ea&s;ie&s;t way to any impre&s;&s;ion made upon them; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e the larger parts of &s;uch fluids as we can view with a micro&s;cope, are of a &s;pheri|cal figure. Thus the parts of mercury
<PB N="45" REF="52">
ri&s;ing in fume are all &s;pherical, the parts of the blood running through a very &s;mall tran&s;parent vein are &s;pherical, &s;o is the chyle or that part of our nutriment which is going to be turned into blood. Derham having examined with a micro|&s;cope a ray of light pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;un into a dark room, found that all the va|pours which danced to and fro in this ray were perfectly globular. If there|fore all the gro&s;&s;er fluids are compo&s;ed of &s;pherical parts, we may from analogy conclude that more &s;ubtil fluids are com|po&s;ed of the &s;ame. But notwith&s;tanding this &s;imilitude, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the air as a very different kind of fluid from water, oils, mercury, or &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances which are called peculiarly liquids. All the parts of liquids we find, when in any quantity, &s;unk with a level &s;urface; but the air, for aught we know, a&s;&s;umes no &s;uch &s;urface.</P>
<P>BUT though the air differs from other fluids in &s;everal properties, which we
<PB N="46" REF="53">
&s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee, yet it agrees with all fluids in this, that it pre&s;&s;es in all kinds of directions with equal force; that is, &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould confine air in a bladder, it pre&s;&s;es again&s;t all parts of the &s;ides of the bladder with equal force, and if the air be continued to be driven in, it will bur&s;t that part of the bladder which is weake&s;t. That the air pre&s;&s;es with as much force any one way as another, that it pre&s;&s;es upward, downward, &s;ideways, obliquely, in all directions with equal force, may be concluded from an experi|ment of Mr. Mariotte. He took a long bottle with a &s;mall hole towards the middle of its &s;ide. This bottle being filled with water, the hole being in the mean time clo&s;ed with the finger, a gla&s;s tube open at both ends was dipped into its mouth, &s;o that the lower end of the tube came below the little hole on the &s;ide. The mouth of the bottle was then well clo&s;ed round the tube with wax, &s;o that no air could enter that way. This being done, water was poured into the tube to
<PB N="47" REF="54">
fill it, and the finger was taken from the hole on the &s;ide. If with a finger in the mean time the top of the tube were &s;topped, and the &s;ide hole thus left open, no water would pour through the &s;ide hole at all for want of vent at top, as the vulgar expre&s;s it. But both holes being left open at top and &s;ide, the effects that followed were the&s;e. The water ran out of the &s;ide, and de&s;cended in the tube to below the level of the hole, and the re&s;t of the bottle remained full. Now from this it appears, that the perpen|dicular pre&s;&s;ure of the air through the tube is but ju&s;t equal to the lateral pre&s;|&s;ure through the hole. For if it exceed|ed, then the whole of the water would be driven through the hole on the &s;ide, which however is by no means the ca&s;e, for the air upon the &s;ide hole pre&s;&s;es as forcibly as that which comes down the perpendicular opening of the tube, and therefore the air pre&s;&s;es equally in all directions.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">FROM this experiment therefore it appears, that air pre&s;&s;es in all directions, upwards, downwards, laterally, and obliquely. Now, why &s;hould we not con&s;ider the particles of air as thus pre&s;&s;ing in all directions upon each other, and if they pre&s;s each other equally every way, their figures mu&s;t mo&s;t probably be &s;pherical. This however is only offered as a conjecture, and luckily for mankind, it matters not whether the&s;e conjectures be true or fal&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Weight of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>AS light as air, is an expre&s;&s;ion made u&s;e of in common conver|&s;ation, yet it is much heavier than is commonly imagined. We have number|le&s;s proofs of its weight, many of which though the ancients could e&s;timate as well as we, yet they con&s;idered it as a &s;ub&s;tance totally void of gravity, and called it an element. An element was &s;omething different from earthly matter, and therefore they con&s;idered it as want|ing material pondero&s;ity. The u&s;age of an undefined name thus &s;atisfied all their curio&s;ity. However all material &s;ub|&s;tances, of which air is one, have weight; like other bodies it falls to the earth, and is more den&s;e as it approaches its center. All people know that air on the tops of high mountains is much rarer and thinner than it is below in the valley; if they &s;hould doubt it, the dif|ference
<PB N="50" REF="57">
they will find in drawing their breath in the different places will clearly convince them. As they go up a very high mountain their breathing becomes quicker, the atmo&s;phere becomes clearer, neither clouds nor vapours are able to ri&s;e to &s;uch heights, and therefore as he a&s;cends the traveller leaves the tempe&s;t and the &s;torm midway below him. Ulloa, who went to take the mea&s;ure of a degree upon the Andes in Peru, which are the highe&s;t mountains in the world, tells us, that when clouds gathered below the mountain's brow while he &s;tood on the top, they &s;eemed like a tempe&s;tuous ocean all da&s;hing and foaming below him, here and there lightnings breaking through the waves, and &s;ometimes two or three &s;uns reflected from its bo&s;om. In the mean time he enjoyed a cloudle&s;s and &s;erene &s;ky, and left the war of the elements to the unphilo&s;ophical mortals on the plain below him.</P>
<P>SUCH appearances as the&s;e, with which the ancients were as well acquainted as
<PB N="51" REF="58">
we, might have led them to con&s;ider the air as having weight; but they were not at this time acquainted with a machine which &s;erves to di&s;cover its weight by proofs much better calculated for con|viction than tho&s;e brought from untried nature. The machine I mean by which we &s;o plainly di&s;cover the weight of the air, is the air-pump. For the fir&s;t in|vention of this, the world is indebted to Otho Gueric, a German; but it was our countryman Boyle who turned it to real u&s;es, it was he who improved it, and applied it to philo&s;ophical purpo&s;es. In the hands of Gueric it was a mechanical in&s;trument; in tho&s;e of Boyle it was a truly philo&s;ophical machine. By this machine we can with ea&s;e empty a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el of its air, and put what bodies into it we think fit. Thus comparing the changes wrought upon bodies by being kept from air, with the &s;ame bodies when expo&s;ed to air, we come to a knowledge of the effects of air upon bodies in general.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">BUT before we come to examine the u&s;es of this machine, let us fir&s;t give its de&s;cription as it is in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement: rather de&s;cribing the in|&s;trument as already made, than giving directions how to make it.</P>
<P>HAVING put a wet leather on the plate L L, (See Fig. 45.) place the large gla&s;s or ve&s;&s;el receiver M with its mouth down|wards upon the leather, &s;o that the hole <HI>i</HI> in the plate may be within the gla&s;s. Then turning the handle F backward and for|ward, the air will be pumped out of the receiver by the contrivance of the mecha|ni&s;m below, which we are going to de&s;cribe. As the handle F, repre&s;ented more at large (Fig. 46.) is turned back|wards, it rai&s;es the &s;ucker or pi&s;ton <HI>d e</HI> in the hollow barrel B K by means of the toothed wheel F engraining in the toothed rack D <HI>d:</HI> and as the pi&s;ton or &s;ucker is leathered &s;o tight as to fit the barrel exactly, no air can get between this pi&s;ton and the barrel, and therefore all the air above <HI>d</HI> in the barrel is lifted

up towards B, and a vacuum made in the barrel from <HI>e</HI> to <HI>b:</HI> upon which part of the air in the gla&s;s M (Fig. 47.) by its &s;pring ru&s;hes through the hole <HI>i</HI> in the bra&s;s plate L L along the pipe G G, which communicates with both barrels by the hollow trunk I H K, and pu&s;hing up the valve <HI>b</HI> (a valve is a bit of leather that covers a hole as the flapper of a bellows, admitting the air in, but &s;uffer|ing none to go back) pu&s;hing up the valve, I &s;ay, the air enters into the vacuity <HI>b e</HI> of the barrel B K. For the air will naturally pre&s;s into tho&s;e places where it is lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;All this is done by drawing the handle towards D. Now then turning the handle forward the con|trary way towards C, the pi&s;ton <HI>d e</HI> is depre&s;&s;ed in the barrel, and as the air which had got into the barrel cannot be pu&s;hed back through the valve <HI>b,</HI> for the valve clo&s;es like the flapper of a bellows, and will not let the air back the way it came, the air mu&s;t therefore a&s;cend through an hole in the pi&s;ton, and e&s;capes
<PB N="54" REF="63">
through a valve at <HI>d</HI>; and is hindered by that valve from returning into the barrel when the pi&s;ton is again rai&s;ed. At the next rai&s;ing of the pi&s;ton, a vacuum is again made in the &s;ame manner as before, between <HI>b</HI> and <HI>e,</HI> upon which more of the air which was left in the gla&s;s receiver M gets out thence, and runs into the more empty barrel B K through the valve <HI>b.</HI> The &s;ame thing is effected with re|gard to the other barrel A I, and as the handle F is turned backwards and for|wards, it alternately rai&s;es and depre&s;&s;es the pi&s;tons in their barrels, always rai&s;ing one while it depre&s;&s;es the other. And as there is a vacuum made in each barrel when its pi&s;ton is rai&s;ed, every particle of air in the receiver M pu&s;hes out an|other through the hole <HI>i</HI> and pipe G G into the barrels, until at la&s;t the air in the gla&s;s receiver comes to be &s;o much rarefied that it can no longer get through the valves, and then no more can be taken out of the receiver. From which it appears there is no &s;uch thing as
<PB N="55" REF="64">
making a perfect vacuum in the receiver; for the air that leaves the receiver is driven out by that which remains be|hind, there mu&s;t therefore &s;ome remain behind at la&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS is the con&s;truction and nature of the celebrated air-pump. Some in&s;tru|ments at fir&s;t contrived only for explain|ing &s;cience, become at la&s;t by frequent u&s;e a part of the &s;cience it&s;elf, and demand an equal explanation. Such is the ca&s;e with this; and the reader mu&s;t pardon our prolixity in the de&s;cription. There is a cock <HI>k</HI> below the plate L L, which being turned, lets air into the receiver again. There is a gla&s;s tube <HI>l m n</HI> open at both ends, and about thirty-four inches long, the upper end communi|cating with the hole in the pump plate, and the lower end immer&s;ed in quick|&s;ilver at <HI>n</HI> in the ve&s;&s;el N. To this tube is fitted a wooden ruler <HI>m m,</HI> divided into inches and parts of an inch from the bottom at <HI>n,</HI> where it is upon a level
<PB N="56" REF="65">
with the &s;urface of the quick&s;ilver, and continued up to the top, a little below <HI>l,</HI> to thirty or thirty-one inches. Now the quick&s;ilver in this tube ri&s;es as the air is exhau&s;ted in the receiver, for it opens into the receiver through the plate L L. And the more the air is exhau&s;ted, the more will the quick&s;ilver ri&s;e, (for a rea&s;on we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee) &s;o that by this means the quantity of air pumped out of the receiver may be very exactly mea&s;ured.</P>
<P>BY means of this in&s;trument the fir&s;t thing we learn is, that the air is actually heavy. If a ve&s;&s;el be by means of the air-pump exhau&s;ted of its air, if we clap the palm of our hand to its mouth we &s;hall quickly perceive the weight of the air upon the back of the hand, pre&s;&s;ing the hand in a manner into the ve&s;&s;el. If a part of the &s;kin of a bladder &s;hould be placed there in&s;tead of the hand, the external air would break the &s;kin with great force, and ru&s;h into the ve&s;&s;el with
<PB N="57" REF="66">
a noi&s;e. If the air be pumped out of a &s;quare gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el, the weight of the ex|ternal air will break the gla&s;s in pieces. If a flat piece of gla&s;s be fixed upon the top of an exhau&s;ted receiver, the air without, pre&s;&s;ing upon the flat gla&s;s, will break it all to pieces. But to put the air's weight pa&s;t all doubt, we can actually weight it in a balance, and it is there found heavy.</P>
<P>HAVING exhau&s;ted the air out of a thin gla&s;s fla&s;k, and &s;u&s;pended it at one end of a balance, which being nicely counterpoized by weights in the other &s;cale. This done, admit the air into the fla&s;k, into which it will ru&s;h with a noi&s;e, and though the fla&s;k was balanced before, it will now upon the admi&s;&s;ion of the air become heavier and prepon|derate. If the fla&s;k holds a quart, it will be found that the weight of the air it now contains is about &s;eventeen grains above what it was when quite empty, &s;o that a quart of air weighed upon an
<PB N="58" REF="67">
average in the open air, is about &s;even|teen grains.</P>
<P>NOW, if a &s;ingle quart of air weighs &s;o much, what would not a pillar of air weigh, the ba&s;e of which re&s;ts upon earth, and who&s;e top reaches &s;everal miles above the clouds. The weight of this pillar mu&s;t &s;urely be great! The weight of &s;uch a pillar, how extraordi|nary &s;oever it may &s;eem, can be deter|mined with the nice&s;t preci&s;ion. We mentioned ju&s;t now with what extreme weight &s;uch a pillar re&s;ted upon the back of the hand which had no air under it to keep it up, or balance the weight above it of the air, but we cannot preci&s;ely tell how great that force is as yet. Let us go a little farther then, and &s;ee with what weight this high pillar of air would pre&s;s upon the &s;urface of a tub of quick|&s;ilver. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a long gla&s;s tube exhau&s;ted of all air, and &s;topped clo&s;e at the top, to be plunged at the other end into it. It is evident that the air will
<PB N="59" REF="68">
pre&s;s upon the &s;urface of the quick|&s;ilver without; and if there were air in the tube, it would pre&s;s up the &s;urface of the quick&s;ilver within the tube al&s;o: but there is no air at all, as was &s;aid, within the tube, for that was exhau&s;ted before the experiment; &s;o that in &s;hort all the air will pre&s;s upon the quick&s;ilver on the out|&s;ide of the tube, and none upon that within. The air, therefore, as it has great weight, will pre&s;s the external &s;ur|face of the quick&s;ilver all over, and drive it up into the hollow of the tube, where there is no pre&s;&s;ure from air at all. As if I pre&s;&s;ed down the palm of my hand upon water, the water would ri&s;e up between the inter&s;tices of my fingers where the pre&s;&s;ure was lea&s;t: By means of this pre&s;&s;ure of the heavy air upon the quick&s;ilver, the quick&s;ilver will be driven up into the tube, and ri&s;e in it, if the tube be long enough, about twenty-nine inches and an half high.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="69">THUS then the air pre&s;&s;es down with a weight capable of making quick&s;ilver ri&s;e to twenty-nine inches and a half. A pillar of air therefore that reaches to the air's greate&s;t height, is ju&s;t as heavy as a pillar of quick&s;ilver of the &s;ame diameter that mea&s;ures exactly twenty-nine inches and an half. For the weight of the air pre&s;&s;ing down mu&s;t be ju&s;t exactly equal to the weight of the quick|&s;ilver that is pre&s;&s;ed up. When one body rai&s;es another to its highe&s;t pitch, and can rai&s;e it no more, the body rai&s;ed then equals the body rai&s;ing. We may there|fore boldly conclude, that a pillar of air which reaches from the top of the atmo|&s;phere, weighs ju&s;t as much as a pillar of quick&s;ilver twenty-nine inches and an half high. The weight of &s;uch a pillar we can ea&s;ily e&s;timate, and con&s;equently mea&s;ure the weight of the atmo&s;phere; but fir&s;t let us mention another ca&s;e &s;imilar to this of the quick&s;ilver, which is, water.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="70">IF by any means we exhau&s;t all the air from a ve&s;&s;el more than thirty-two feet high, and &s;topping one end, &s;et the other in water, the water will ri&s;e thirty-two feet within the ve&s;&s;el and no higher, for the weight of the air will pre&s;s upon the &s;urface of the external water as it did before upon the &s;urface of the quick|&s;ilver, and pre&s;s up the one as well as the other with all its weight. A pillar of water of thirty-two feet high ju&s;t weighs equally with a pillar of quick|&s;ilver twenty-nine inches; the air there|fore pre&s;&s;es up that thirty-two feet, as it pre&s;&s;ed up this twenty-nine inches. The weight therefore of a pillar of the atmo&s;phere is equal to either a pillar of quick&s;ilver twenty-nine inches high, or to a pillar of water thirty-two feet high; it is equal to either, for they are equal to each other.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention an obvious experiment to this purpo&s;e, which the &s;tudent can put into practice without any apparatus
<PB N="62" REF="71">
while at tea. Some water being poured into a &s;aucer, let him burn a bit of paper in a tea-cup, which will drive the air out, and make a vacuum in the cup. Then while the paper is yet burning, let him turn it down paper and all into the &s;aucer, and the air without will pre&s;s the water up from the &s;aucer into the cup. The water will &s;tand within the cup in a column, and if the cup were thirty-two feet high, and the air within it perfectly exhau&s;ted, the water would ri&s;e &s;o high in it; as we have &s;aid before.</P>
<P>IF what has been &s;aid is well under|&s;tood, the &s;tudent will be at no lo&s;s to account for the ri&s;ing of water in pumps, or the &s;tanding of the quick&s;ilver in the barometer.</P>
<P>A PUMP is a machine of &s;o much utility, that its con&s;truction mu&s;t be de&s;cribed before we proceed. It is u&s;ed as we all know for rai&s;ing water from deep wells, and thus &s;aving the labour
<PB N="63" REF="72">
of winding it up with buckets, or going down into the well our&s;elves to rai&s;e it. The whole machine is formed upon this principle, that the air will pre&s;s up a column of water thirty-two feet high into a tube or pipe in which there is no air. The air is drawn out of the tube by a pi&s;ton or &s;ucker, and the water fol|lows it. The tube A B I (See Fig. 48.) which we will &s;uppo&s;e is made of gla&s;s, repre&s;ents the pump, or pump-&s;tick, as it is vulgarly called. In this there is a pi&s;ton D <HI>d</HI> G, which we can pu&s;h up and down like the handle of a &s;yringe, or a churn. This pi&s;ton is leathered round at G &s;o as to fit the bore exactly, with|out &s;uffering any air to come between it and the tube or pump-&s;tick. Now then hold the machine thus con&s;tructed up|right in the ve&s;&s;el of water K, the water being deep enough to ri&s;e at lea&s;t as high as from A to L. The valve <HI>a</HI> is fixed within the moveable pi&s;ton G, and the valve <HI>b</HI> on the fixed box H, which quite fills the bore of the pipe or barrel at H.
<PB N="64" REF="73">
The&s;e valves are &s;o made as to let all the water come upward, but to &s;uffer none of it to pa&s;s downward, for the more the water pre&s;&s;es back, the clo&s;er they &s;hut. Now then the work begins: by the handle E the pi&s;ton which was fir&s;t at B is drawn up to C, and this will make room for the air in the pump below the pi&s;ton to dilate it&s;elf, and therefore it will have le&s;s weight than the air on the out&s;ide of the pump barrel, and the out|&s;ide air will therefore pre&s;s up the water into the tube in proportion to the exce&s;s of its weight. Therefore at the fir&s;t lift of the pi&s;ton the outward air will pre&s;s up the water through the notched foot A, into the lower pipe about as far as <HI>e.</HI> This will contract the rarefied air in the pipe between <HI>e</HI> and C into a &s;maller compa&s;s, and thus it will become as heavy as it was in the beginning. As its weight or rather &s;pring therefore be|comes as great as that of the outward air, the outward air can pre&s;s the water at this time no higher than <HI>e,</HI> and the
<PB N="65" REF="74">
valve <HI>b,</HI> which was rai&s;ed a little by the air's ri&s;ing through it, will again fall back and &s;top the hole in the box H, the &s;urface of the water &s;tanding at <HI>e.</HI> Then the pi&s;ton is depre&s;&s;ed from C to B, and as the air in the part B cannot get back again through the valve <HI>b,</HI> it will, as the pi&s;ton de&s;cends, rai&s;e the valve <HI>a,</HI> and &s;o make its way through the upper part of the barrel <HI>d</HI> into the open air. But upon rai&s;ing the pi&s;ton G a &s;econd time, the air between it and the water, in the lower pipe at <HI>e,</HI> will be again left at liberty to fill a larger &s;pace, and &s;o its weight being thus dimini&s;hed again, the pre&s;&s;ure of the outward air on the water in the ve&s;&s;el K will force more water up into the lower pipe from <HI>e</HI> to <HI>f,</HI> and when the pi&s;ton is at its greate&s;t height C, the lower valve <HI>b</HI> will fall back, and &s;top the hole in the box H, as be|fore. At the third lifting up of the pi&s;ton, the water will ri&s;e through the box H towards B, and then the valve <HI>b,</HI> which was rai&s;ed by it, will fall back when
<PB N="66" REF="75">
the pi&s;ton G is at its greate&s;t height. Upon depre&s;&s;ing the pi&s;ton the third time, the water cannot be pu&s;hed back through the valve <HI>b,</HI> which keeps clo&s;e upon the hole whil&s;t the pi&s;ton de&s;cends. Upon rai&s;ing the pi&s;ton the fourth time, the outward pre&s;&s;ure of the air will force the water up through H, where it will rai&s;e the valve, and follow the pi&s;ton to C. Upon the next depre&s;&s;ion of the pi|&s;ton, it will force down into the water in the barrel B, and as the water cannot be driven back through the valve <HI>b</HI> now clo&s;e, it will rai&s;e the valve <HI>a</HI> in the pi&s;ton as this is driven down, and it will al&s;o be lifted up with the pi&s;ton when that is rai&s;ed next; for the valve <HI>a</HI> will not permit it to go back again. And now the whole &s;pace below the pi&s;ton being full of water, as it is alternately rai&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed, the water will ri&s;e through its valve, but cannot de&s;cend by it; for it clo&s;es the firmer the more the water pu&s;hes back. Therefore, as the pi&s;ton continues to work, fre&s;h water will con|tinually
<PB N="67" REF="76">
get up through it, and none getting down, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily run out at top through the pipe F. And thus, by continuing to rai&s;e and depre&s;s the pi&s;ton, more water &s;till will be rai&s;ed, which getting over the pipe F into the wide top I, will &s;upply the pipe, and make it run with an uninterrupted &s;tream. So then at every time the pi&s;ton is rai&s;ed, the valve <HI>b</HI> ri&s;es, and the valve <HI>a</HI> falls; and at every time the pi&s;ton is depre&s;&s;ed, the valve <HI>b</HI> falls, and the valve <HI>a</HI> ri&s;es. By this contrivance it is, that water is rai&s;ed in our u&s;ual pumps (for there are other kinds of pumps which we &s;hall examine at another time) and if the exhau&s;ted tube in which it ri&s;es be thirty-two feet high, the water will a&s;cend to that height, and no higher; for the air on the outward &s;urface of the water can pre&s;s it down only with a weight equal to a pillar of water thirty-two feet high.</P>
<P>WHAT we have now &s;een with re|gard to pumps, we may every day &s;ee
<PB N="68" REF="77">
practi&s;ed in a &s;maller degree by the com|mon &s;yringe. If one of its ends be put into water, and the pi&s;ton be drawn up, this will make a &s;pace void of air, and the water will be pre&s;&s;ed up into the void, and thus fill the &s;yringe.</P>
<P>WHEN children &s;uck at the brea&s;t, it is by a natural mechani&s;m &s;omewhat re|&s;embling that of the &s;yringe; for the child &s;wallows the air in his mouth, then &s;tops its entrance into the mouth by the no&s;trils, and then &s;queezes the nipple between his lips, &s;o that no air can come that way. Thus there is a void in the mouth, and the external air pre&s;&s;ing upon the mother's brea&s;t, &s;queezes the milk into the infant's mouth, and by this means it finds the nouri&s;hment proper for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>CUPPING-GLASSES may be explained upon the &s;ame principle. That part of the body under the mouth of the gla&s;s has no pre&s;&s;ure of air upon it; for the
<PB N="69" REF="78">
air was driven out of the gla&s;s by heat, before the gla&s;s was applied. The hu|mours of the body are pu&s;hed to that place where they find lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e appearances in nature are performed, as was &s;aid, by the weight of the air pre&s;&s;ing the fluids into places where there was no air, nor any other re&s;i&s;tance. But though the&s;e truths are now as obvious as they are a&s;toni&s;hing, yet for many ages the cau&s;es of the a&s;|cending of water in pumps was utterly unknown. Philo&s;ophers were content with thinking after Ari&s;totle, and his opi|nion was, that nature hated a void or empty &s;pace, and therefore made all po&s;|&s;ible efforts to fill it when the art of man had made one. All this may be very true; but we want to know, why na|ture hates this void? And here their philo&s;ophy was puzzled. Torricelli was the fir&s;t who undertook to ex|plain, as we have &s;een, why nature made ha&s;te to fill up this void. An accidental

Having filled a tube, which was &s;topt at one end, with quick|&s;ilver, and then fixed this tube with its open end in a tub filled with the &s;ame: the quick&s;ilver in the tube did not all de&s;cend into the tub, but &s;tood in the tube at the height of twenty-nine inches and an half. This experiment was &s;oon com|municated to the learned of Europe: the genius of the times all over Europe was then employed in que&s;t of new adven|tures; Boyle, Pa&s;chal, and Riccioli, &s;et them&s;elves to con&s;ider this new phae|nomenon; and this led them to the following conclu&s;ions. Water ri&s;es in a void thirty-two feet high, as we have for ages &s;een in pumps; quick&s;ilver &s;tands twenty-nine inches high, as we &s;ee in this new experiment; a pillar of the one weighs exactly as much as a pillar of the other; the a&s;cent of both there|fore mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to one and the &s;ame cau&s;e. And why may not this cau&s;e be owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of a pillar of air?
<PB N="71" REF="80">
And if the pre&s;&s;ure of this pillar of air were taken away, would the quick|&s;ilver then &s;tand in the tube? Let the Torricellian tube, ve&s;&s;el, quick&s;ilver, and all, be placed under the gla&s;s of the air pump, and let the weight of the air be taken away from the quick&s;ilver. It will then be found to &s;tand no longer &s;u&s;pend|ed in the tube, but will &s;ink down to the &s;ame level with the re&s;t of the quick|&s;ilver in the ve&s;&s;el in which it is placed. This was enough, and indeed fully &s;ufficient to convince them, they pur&s;ued the track of light as it led, and at length they de|duced a theory of the air equally clear and convincing.</P>
<P>WE mortals, who are upon the &s;urface of the earth, &s;aid they, re&s;emble fi&s;hes at the bottom of the ocean: like them we are enveloped in a fluid of air, which ri&s;es far above our heads, an ocean of atmo&s;phere, which while on earth we cannot quit. This atmo&s;phere &s;urrounds our whole earth for &s;ome miles high, enveloping the
<PB N="72" REF="81">
earth on every &s;ide. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the tops of the highe&s;t mountains thru&s;ting up their heads through this great fluid, like rocks in the ocean that almo&s;t ri&s;e to, but not quite &s;o high as the &s;ur|face. As the parts of this ambient atmo&s;phere are all heavy, they pre&s;s down one upon another, and tho&s;e parts that are lowe&s;t will &s;uffer the great|e&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, as they have the greate&s;t number of parts above pre&s;&s;ing them down. The lower vallies will, therefore, &s;uffer greater pre&s;&s;ure from the atmo|&s;phere than the higher mountains. Let then the Torricellian tube be brought into a low valley: here the pre&s;&s;ure up|on the quick&s;ilver will be greate&s;t, and it will ri&s;e above twenty-nine inches and an half. Let it be now brought up to the top of an high mountain: here the pre&s;|&s;ure will be lea&s;t, and it will &s;ink down proportionably. On the &s;ummit of Snow|don-hill, Dr. Halley found the baro|meter above three degrees lower than at the bottom. On the &s;ummit of an Al|pine
<PB N="73" REF="82">
mountain, the Abb&egrave; Nollet found it a quarter le&s;s high than on the plains of Piedmont. Thus therefore the tube of Torricelli, by the quick&s;ilver ri&s;ing or falling, will &s;erve very exactly to mea|&s;ure the weight of the air.</P>
<P>AS the quick&s;ilver in the tube &s;ome|times in the &s;ame place &s;tands an inch or two higher, and &s;ometimes &s;everal inches lower, than twenty-nine inches and an half, it is very plain, that the air is &s;ome|times heavier and &s;ometimes lighter: than when heavier, it pre&s;&s;es up the quick&s;ilver above twenty-nine inches; when lighter, the quick&s;ilver &s;uffering le&s;s pre&s;&s;ure ri&s;es not &s;o high.</P>
<P>THE tube therefore will exactly de|termine the&s;e variations, and its heights will alter with every change. This in|&s;trument was fir&s;t called the Torricellian Tube; but being now made u&s;e of for mea&s;uring the alterations and weight of the air, it is called the Barometer, or
<PB N="74" REF="83">
Weather-gla&s;s. The &s;imple&s;t and per|haps the be&s;t method of making the ba|rometer is thus: a gla&s;s tube, of about thirty-five inches, hermetically &s;ealed at one end, is to be filled with quick&s;ilver. Hermetically &s;ealing a gla&s;s is no more than holding the end in the flame of a candle, or fire, until the gla&s;s &s;oftens, and then twi&s;ting it round, &s;o as quite to clo&s;e up the orifice, and filled with quick&s;ilver well purged of its air, which it may be by boiling the quick&s;ilver in water. The finger being then placed on the open end, this end is &s;et into a ba&s;on of the &s;ame prepared mercury. Then upon removing the finger, the mercury in the ba&s;on will join with that in the tube, and that in the tube will &s;ink down to about twenty-nine inches and an half, one time with another. In&s;tead of a ba&s;on at the bottom, the lower end is u&s;ually turned up, and dilated into a &s;ort of cup, containing a quantity of quick&s;ilver; upon which the air pre&s;&s;es, and &s;o drives it up along
<PB N="75" REF="84">
the bend of the tube to the u&s;ual height. This tube thus fitted and filled is then fa&s;tened to a board, which has the inches marked upon it; and towards the top tho&s;e inches are divided into their parts, in order to mea&s;ure the ri&s;ing and falling of the quick&s;ilver more preci&s;ely. (Nollet, fig. 25, vol. II. plate 5.)</P>
<P>IT is no ea&s;y matter to make a baro|meter which &s;hall vary with the minute&s;t variations of the weather, for there are &s;e|veral requi&s;ites which mu&s;t be attended to for this purpo&s;e. The tube mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, be of an equal bore from top to bottom, which few gla&s;s tubes are found to be. The mercury mu&s;t be perfectly free from air, which it &s;eldom is. The tube mu&s;t be no wider in warm weather than in cold, which is impo&s;&s;ible. The&s;e and &s;ome other inconveniencies have induced arti&s;ts to try other methods of making barometers: they have employed diffe|rent fluids, &s;uch as &s;pirit of wine, water,

oil, and &s;uch like: the &s;imple barometer, however, &s;eems to be mo&s;t in e&s;teem &s;till.</P>
<P>AN in&s;trument contrived in this man|ner will pretty nearly &s;erve to mea&s;ure the weight of the atmo&s;phere; it will not preci&s;ely mea&s;ure its weight, becau&s;e it is affected al&s;o by another property of the air, namely, its ela&s;ticity or &s;pring, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its proper place. By this in&s;trument we learn, that the air is chang|ing its weight continually, being &s;ome|times more heavy, &s;ometimes more light; but upon an average, its weight (and &s;pring together) are able to pre&s;s up a pillar of quick&s;ilver twenty-nine inches and an half high, or a pillar of water thirty-three feet high.</P>
<P>THE atmo&s;phere thus pre&s;&s;ing down upon the &s;urface of the earth envelopes all the bodies upon its &s;urface, and pre&s;&s;es them together. The whole earth may be con&s;idered to &s;uffer as great a pre&s;|&s;ure
<PB N="77" REF="86">
from the atmo&s;phere, as if it were pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide by water thirty-three feet deep; and all that are upon the earth's &s;urface are as much pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide as we would be, if in&s;tead of an airy atmo&s;phere we had an atmo|&s;phere of water, like fi&s;hes, thirty-three feet above our heads. The weight of &s;uch an atmo&s;phere of water can be ea&s;ily calculated. A cubic foot of water we will &s;uppo&s;e to weigh 60 pounds, 33 feet will weigh 33 times 60, that is 1980 pounds. Suppo&s;e a middle-&s;ized man has a &s;urface of about 14 feet &s;quare, he will &s;u&s;tain 14 times 1980 pounds of water, that is 27,720 pounds. If a man &s;u&s;tains &s;o much, who is but 14 feet &s;quare, how much weight of atmo&s;phere will not the whole earth &s;u&s;tain, which hath a &s;urface of more than two millions of &s;quare miles? The &s;tudent with his multiplication table can readily an&s;wer the que&s;tion. Thus, whether the earth &s;u&s;tains a weight of water thirty-three feet high, or an airy atmo&s;phere equal
<PB N="78" REF="87">
in weight, the difference is nothing, it will be equally pre&s;&s;ed by both. Thus, in the atmo&s;phere in which we move with &s;o much freedom, and which we traver&s;e with &s;o much rapidity, we are pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides with an almo&s;t incre|dible weight, and our bodies &s;eldom &s;up|port le&s;s than twelve ton of air at a time.</P>
<P>SO great a pre&s;&s;ure of air upon his body may well &s;urpri&s;e the ignorant, and &s;hake his belief; but he mu&s;t con&s;ider, that this weight of air he has carried from his earlie&s;t infancy. Sen&s;ations to which we have been always accu&s;tomed, are &s;carce felt: we cannot perceive the difference of things, when we have no &s;tandard by which to mea&s;ure their vari|ations; we cannot perceive the weight of the air, becau&s;e we have always felt its weight, and cannot remove from its pre&s;&s;ure. No one part of the body can be di&s;turbed by its pre&s;&s;ure, for it lays the load equally upon all. Be&s;ides this,
<PB N="79" REF="88">
there is air within the body, which &s;erves to counterbalance that from without; and there is another con&s;ideration al&s;o, which naturali&s;ts have pa&s;&s;ed over unno|ticed. The heat of our bodies rarifies the air on their &s;urface; &s;o that in fact an animal doth not &s;u&s;tain &s;o great a pre&s;&s;ure from the air as cold inanimate &s;ub&s;tances are found to &s;u&s;tain. In &s;hort, to u&s;e the words of Borelli, &s;ince by the air's pre&s;|&s;ure none of the parts of our bodies can &s;uffer either &s;eparation, or luxation, or contu&s;ion, nor any other change, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that this pre&s;&s;ure can produce any pain.</P>
<P>THIS pre&s;&s;ure then can do no injury to the animal frame, we find it by experience of infinite utility. By it the parts of our bodies are kept compactly together, by it the fluids in our ve&s;&s;els are prevented from bur&s;ting their ca|nals. Travellers, in a&s;cending high mountains, feel the want of this pre&s;&s;ure, to which they were accu&s;tomed in the
<PB N="80" REF="89">
valley: as they a&s;cend, they perceive a total la&s;&s;itude upon them from the dilatation of their ve&s;&s;els, and at la&s;t the blood begins to bur&s;t through the fine coats of the lungs, and they &s;pit blood. The &s;ame thing is &s;een in other animals under the gla&s;s re|ceiver of an air-pump: in proportion as the air is exhau&s;ted, they pant, &s;well, vo|mit, &s;weat, and generally are unable to retain their abdominal contents.</P>
<P>NOR is the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere le&s;s &s;erviceable in forcing the parts which fly from bodies upon our &s;en&s;e either of ta&s;ting or &s;melling. The air in a manner forces them down by pre&s;&s;ure upon the nerves that &s;erve tho&s;e &s;en&s;es: for this rea&s;on it is, that upon the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, (the Peak of Teneriff, for in&s;tance) the &s;ub&s;tances which have the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t pun|gent ta&s;te, &s;uch as pepper, ginger, &s;alt, and &s;pirit of wine, are there almo&s;t in&s;i|pid: there perfumes lo&s;e their odour, and a&s;&s;afoetida its &s;cent. This ari&s;es from
<PB N="81" REF="90">
the want of a &s;ufficient agent to impre&s;s the &s;mall parts of tho&s;e bodies, that are continually flying off, either upon the ol|factory nerves, or on tho&s;e of the tongue.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere is al&s;o equally &s;erviceable to the vegetable world. By it the juices in the tubular parts of vegetables are prevented from bur&s;ting their channels, and a proper quan|tity of air is pre&s;&s;ed into them, and thus &s;erves to carry on that continual flow of &s;ap through all their parts, by which means they vegetate. If this pre&s;|&s;ure is taken away, plants no longer vegetate: the mo&s;t thriving flower, when conveyed under an air-pump, quickly withers and fades, the air within expand|ing e&s;capes through the pores of the plant, and leaves its juices deprived of the agent that helps to drive them for|ward.</P>
<P>IN the inorganized parts of nature this pre&s;&s;ure too is entirely nece&s;&s;ary; for it
<PB N="82" REF="91">
is owing to this pre&s;&s;ure that many bodies mix with each other, which they would not do in a void. Thus liquids, &s;uch as oils and &s;alts, which mix readily of them|&s;elves in the open air, will not, when placed in an air pump, unite with all the art of man. In con&s;equence al&s;o of this pre&s;&s;ure, and of the air's fluidity, it is that the ac|tion of fire is directed from one body up|on another, and becomes efficacious. Thus fire in the open air may be applied to wood, and the fire will effectually burn it; but when the &s;ame is applied in the exhau&s;ted air-pump, the flame will no longer operate upon the wood, for there is then no longer an agent which can pre&s;s its parts upon the &s;ub&s;tance which it is &s;et to con&s;ume. The &s;ame thing will happen if we attempt to di&s;&s;olve gold in aqua regia. This men&s;truum cea&s;es to act upon the metal as &s;oon as the air is pumped away. This property of weight in the air al&s;o produces the winds, as we &s;hall be led &s;hortly to believe. In &s;hort, the weight of the atmo&s;phere, in&s;tead of
<PB N="83" REF="92">
being injurious, is our greate&s;t comforter and a&s;&s;i&s;tant: when it is heavie&s;t, our &s;pirits are found to be lighte&s;t; when by pre&s;&s;ing down it drives up the quick|&s;ilver in the weather-gla&s;s to its greate&s;t height, it is then we feel our&s;elves invi|gorated and enlivened. The weather-gla&s;s &s;hews us, that in fine weather the at|mo&s;phere is then always the mo&s;t heavy; and yet there are few who do not find them&s;elves on &s;uch occa&s;ions more alert than in dull weather, when the &s;mall pre&s;&s;ure the quick&s;ilver &s;u&s;tains evinces that the atmo&s;phere is then mo&s;t light.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Ela&s;ticity or Spring of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t chapter we only made men|tion of the weight of the air, and of the effects of its pre&s;&s;ure; but this pre&s;|&s;ure is increa&s;ed by another cau&s;e, I mean the air's &s;pring or ela&s;ticity. We ex|plained &s;everal appearances in nature that re&s;ulted from its pre&s;&s;ure; but the&s;e appearances were not entirely cau&s;ed by pre&s;&s;ure alone, for the air's ela&s;ticity con|&s;pired with its weight to work the&s;e ef|fects: by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this property, water ri&s;es in pumps, and &s;tands in the barometer.</P>
<P>BY the ela&s;ticity of the air is meant that property, which this fluid has pecu|liar only to it&s;elf, of yielding to pre&s;&s;ure on every &s;ide, and then upon the pre&s;|&s;ure's being taken away, &s;pringing out to its former dimen&s;ions. Water, which is
<PB N="85" REF="94">
a fluid, can &s;carcely be pre&s;&s;ed into a &s;maller compa&s;s by all the art of man; nor can quick&s;ilver be compre&s;&s;ed: &s;team, which is a fluid, may be compre&s;|&s;ed into a &s;maller &s;pace, indeed; but then we de&s;troy its properties: it turns to wa|ter, and therefore cannot recover its for|mer dimen&s;ions. Air is the only fluid we know that can be pre&s;&s;ed into a &s;maller &s;pace than that in which it was contained before, and which, when the force is re|moved, recovers its former dimen&s;ions. Thus the air, for in&s;tance, which fills a bladder, might be pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;pace of a nut-&s;hell. And as the air may be thus compre&s;&s;ed into a &s;maller &s;pace, &s;o it can be dilated to fill a larger: the air that fills a bladder, if &s;uffered to expand, would diffu&s;e it&s;elf equally, and fill a whole hou&s;e.</P>
<P>INFINITE are the proofs which may be brought to prove this ela&s;tic &s;pring in the air. A bladder, when blown, may be pre&s;&s;ed in by the finger; but the air,
<PB N="86" REF="95">
upon the removal of the pre&s;&s;ure, with true ela&s;tic force pu&s;hes the part out again. If we place this bladder, almo&s;t quite empty, in the receiver of the air-pump, and then exhau&s;t the air from the re|ceiver, the air within the bladder will then exert its power of dilating, the pre&s;|&s;ure of the external air being taken off, and the bladder, before flaccid, will now appear full, as if ju&s;t blown up by the breath. A flaccid bladder, carried up to the top of a mountain, will exhibit the &s;ame appearance; the air without be|ing more thin at that height, the air within will dilate it&s;elf. If in&s;tead of putting an half-empty bladder under the air-pump, we &s;hould put a blown blad|der there, when the void is made around it, the force of the &s;pring of its internal air is too &s;trong for the &s;ides, and the bladder quickly bur&s;ts. If, in&s;tead of a bladder, we &s;hould try the experiment upon gla&s;s bubbles filled with air, the ef|fects would be the &s;ame: the&s;e, like the bladder, would bur&s;t in pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="96">THIS &s;hews the air to be ela&s;tic; but it al&s;o &s;hews, that this ela&s;ticity is very different from the ela&s;ticity of an ivory ball, or a coiled watch-&s;pring, or any &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance, to which the air has been &s;ome|times compared. An ivory ball, when the pre&s;&s;ure, which bent its parts inwards, is removed, &s;tarts out again to its former &s;ize and &s;hape: a watch &s;pring, when the pre&s;&s;ure that keeps it coiled is re|moved, flies out to its former length. But it is very different with a bladder of air: if the pre&s;&s;ure is removed from its &s;ur|face, the air contained not only &s;tarts out to fill the &s;ame &s;pace it occupied before, but ten thou&s;and times that &s;pace, if no new pre&s;&s;ure prevents it from dilating.</P>
<P>TO account for this &s;urpri&s;ing force of expan&s;ion, of which the air is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, has not a little employed the thoughts of the &s;peculative. Some have compared the air to watch &s;prings or hoops, which coiled up by pre&s;&s;ure, re&s;tore them&s;elves again. Others re&s;embled the air to little flocks
<PB N="88" REF="97">
of wool: No more, &s;aid they, is nece&s;&s;ary, if we would produce ela&s;tic air, but to &s;eek it in bodies thus di&s;po&s;ed in &s;piral circles; and bodies, which are mo&s;t &s;u&s;|ceptible of this ela&s;tic di&s;po&s;ition, are &s;uch as will mo&s;t ea&s;ily furni&s;h air. And for that rea&s;on it is, continue they, that liquids cannot be converted into air, be|cau&s;e of the roundne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of their parts.</P>
<P>ALL this, which is ob&s;cure enough, has been ju&s;tly controverted by Newton. The air's extreme expan&s;ion to a &s;pace an hundred thou&s;and times greater than what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon pre&s;&s;ure, could not be accounted for upon &s;uch a bungling mechani&s;m as that of a watch &s;pring, which cannot expand a thou&s;andth part of what we find the air to do. He there|fore thinks, that as all bodies have a re|pul&s;ive power as well as an attractive, this repul&s;ive power always begins to act when the attractive power can reach no farther. Now the parts of the
<PB N="89" REF="98">
air, which he &s;uppo&s;es to have been &s;olid at fir&s;t, and which were con&s;equently while &s;olid within the &s;phere of each other's attraction, being in this ca&s;e driven a&s;under by &s;ome external interpo&s;ition, &s;uch as fire, or any other agent, no mat|ter what; the&s;e parts thus &s;eparated lo&s;e their attractive and acquire a repul&s;ive force. The parts fly from each other, expand, and fill a &s;phere almo&s;t equal to the extent of imagination: for, to u&s;e his own words,
<Q REND="margQuotes">"Particles (&s;ays he) when &s;haken off from bodies by heat or fermentation, &s;o &s;oon as they are beyond the reach of the attraction of the body, recede from it, and al&s;o from one another, with great &s;trength, and keep at a di&s;tance, &s;o as &s;ometimes to take up a million times more &s;pace than they did before in the form of a den&s;e body."</Q>
This va&s;t contraction and ex|pan&s;ion &s;eem unintelligible, by feign|ing the particles of air to be &s;pringy and ramous, or rolled up like hoops, or by
<PB N="90" REF="99">
<HI>(feigning)</HI> any other means <HI>than that</HI> of a repul&s;ive power.</P>
<P>AS we thus &s;ee the particles of air, when the external pre&s;&s;ure is removed, fly from each other with &s;uch repul&s;ive force, it will be matter of curio&s;ity, and of moment al&s;o, to inquire how great that force is, and how much it is dimini&s;hed, as the particles of air are le&s;s pre&s;&s;ed to|gether. In the fir&s;t place, then, Boyle and Mariotte have found by experiment, that the le&s;s forcibly they pre&s;&s;ed the par|ticles of air together, the le&s;s violently did the particles of air repel each other; and &s;o, on the contrary, the more vio|lently they pre&s;&s;ed a body of air, the more forcibly did the air re&s;i&s;t their pre&s;|&s;ure, the repelling power of its particles becoming greater the nearer they were driven to each other. Thus, for in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e a gallon of common air were to be pre&s;&s;ed into a &s;maller compa&s;s, if a pre&s;&s;ure of one hundred pound &s;queezed
<PB N="91" REF="100">
this air into a pottle, it would require the pre&s;&s;ure of two hundred pounds to &s;queeze it into a quart, the pre&s;&s;ure of four hundred pounds to &s;queeze it into a pint, and &s;o on. But another experiment will lead us &s;till farther, and &s;hew, that the force with which it expands is always equal to the force which pre&s;&s;es it. Let us &s;uppo&s;e an upright tube thirty inches long, its lower end plunged into a bottle half filled with quick&s;ilver, the mouth of the bottle clo&s;ed fa&s;t round it, and the tube open at top. Let us next imagine a gla&s;s receiver, by &s;ome contrivance made tall enough to cover this tube, bottle and all, and let the receiver be then ex|hau&s;ted of all its air. The air in the in&s;ide bottle, however, cannot be exhau&s;t|ed, for it cannot e&s;cape; the mouth is clo&s;ed fa&s;t round the tube, and therefore it mu&s;t pre&s;s upon the quick&s;ilver beneath. This it will do, and pu&s;h it into the tube, who&s;e end was plunged into it, and the air, &s;till continuing to pre&s;s the quick|&s;ilver, will at length pre&s;s it, merely by
<PB N="92" REF="101">
its &s;pring or ela&s;ticity, as high as it would actually ri&s;e in the barometer, by the weight of a pillar of air reaching to the top of the atmo&s;phere. The air's ela&s;|ticity, therefore, mu&s;t be equal to the weight; and whatever be the weight or pre&s;&s;ure upon any part of the air, its ela&s;ticity mu&s;t be equal to it.</P>
<P>FROM hence then we &s;ee, that what|ever effects are wrought by the weight of the atmo&s;phere in pre&s;&s;ing up quick|&s;ilver into the barometer, or into pumps, the &s;pring or ela&s;ticity of the air is able to perform the &s;ame. Yet we are not for this rea&s;on to di&s;card the weight of the atmo&s;phere, and con&s;ider it as no way nece&s;&s;ary in producing the&s;e effects: an opinion &s;ome have actually embraced. By no means: it is the weight of the air that gives it its great ela&s;ticity; take away the weight, and the ela&s;tic force cea&s;es. On the tops of mountains, where this weight is le&s;s, the air is le&s;s ela&s;tic al&s;o, and it pre&s;&s;es up quick&s;ilver above

<P>BOYLE was of opinion, that the air, at the &s;urface of the earth, was pre&s;&s;ed into almo&s;t fourteen thou&s;and times as much le&s;s &s;pace as it would dilate to by virtue of its own ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>MANY authors have taken pains to calculate into how wide a &s;phere its par|ticles would diffu&s;e them&s;elves, if &s;uf|fered to expand at freedom. This in|quiry is &s;ubject to many difficulties; for to know how much the air would dilate it&s;elf, we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as purged from tho&s;e heterogeneous mixtures, with which we ever find it united. Mu&s;chen|broek, from &s;ome inconclu&s;ive experi|ments, &s;uppo&s;es that the air at the &s;ur|face of our globe might be dilated &s;o much, as to fill a &s;pace four thou&s;and times as large as that it at pre&s;ent u&s;ually occupies. Boyle, as I &s;aid, affirms, that by means of the air-pump he has rare|fied
<PB N="94" REF="103">
common air &s;o as to fill near four|teen thou&s;and times the &s;pace which it occupied before; but air conden&s;ed into its &s;malle&s;t &s;pace could fill 50,000 times as much &s;pace as it did before. In &s;hort, &s;o great is this rarefaction, which can be produced by art, that &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, that if a nut-&s;hell filled with air were &s;uf|fered to dilate, it would fill all &s;pace. This, however, is but mere &s;pecu|lation.</P>
<P>WHETHER air can be infinitely dilated or not, we cannot tell; and wherever the doctrines of infinity enter into phi|lo&s;ophy, knowledge cea&s;es, and we talk at random. This however is certain, that air can be found deprived of its ex|pan&s;ive ela&s;tic force, and therefore we may readily conceive a point, to which, if it dilates, it cea&s;es to be ela&s;tic. Hawk&s;|bee has &s;hewn us, that its parts can be &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed by violent pre&s;&s;ure, that it cannot recover its tone till after &s;ome time, and this only by pre&s;&s;ing it into wa|ter,
<PB N="95" REF="104">
and then ob&s;erving how much time it took to di&s;engage it&s;elf. Fontenelle a&s;&s;ures us, that humidity in &s;ome mea|&s;ure de&s;troys the ela&s;ticity of the air for a time; but though the te&s;timony of the&s;e naturali&s;ts may be controverted, yet that of Hales mu&s;t confirm us in the opinion: for he deprived the air of its ela&s;ticity by the fumes of &s;ulphur, and perhaps there are many natural exha|lations which produce the &s;ame effect, and therefore, when the air arrives at a certain height, it may cea&s;e to expand, and &s;o terminate the &s;urface of our at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>AS the air is thus capable of the mo&s;t ela&s;tic expan&s;ion, &s;o is it al&s;o of being pre&s;&s;ed into a &s;mall compa&s;s. How far this pre&s;&s;ure may reach, or what is the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree to which a cer|tain quantity of air may be reduced, has not yet been well a&s;certained. Halley a&s;&s;ures us, from his own experiments, and tho&s;e of the academy of Cimento,
<PB N="96" REF="105">
that the air may be reduced into a &s;pace eight hundred times le&s;s than what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before in common. Halley, however, has gone much farther than this: by means of freezing it, when mixed with water in an iron ball, he re|duced the air into a volume eighteen hundred times le&s;s than it had before: &s;o that we &s;ee by this means air was con|den&s;ed into a &s;ub&s;tance twice as heavy as water, a thing which may excite &s;urpri&s;e. Upon this &s;u&s;ceptibility of conden&s;ation in the air, and its &s;urpri&s;ing power of ex|pan&s;ion, when pre&s;&s;ure is removed, has the air-gun been contrived: an in&s;tru|ment by which balls are &s;hot off with the force even of a cannon, by the &s;pring of the air only, and which, with|out making any report, carry the mo&s;t &s;ure de&s;truction. The common air-gun is made of bra&s;s, and has two bar|rels. The middle barrel KA (&s;ee fig. 50.) from which the bullets are &s;hot, and the larger out&s;ide barrel, clo&s;ed up at the end C D, and in this the
<PB N="97" REF="106">
air is driven and kept conden&s;ed, by means of a &s;yringe M, which drives the air in, but &s;uffers none to go back. This &s;yringe having been worked for &s;ome time, the air is accumulated in great quantities in the external barrel, and this air may be made to &s;trike upon the ball K by means of the trigger O, which pulls back the &s;piral R, and this &s;piral opens a valve behind the ball. When the valve is open, the air conden&s;ed in the outward barrel ru&s;hes in behind the ball, and drives it out with great vio|lence, &s;o great, that at twenty-&s;ix yards di&s;tance it would drive through an oak board half an inch thick. If the valve behind K be &s;hut &s;uddenly, one charge of conden&s;ed air may make &s;everal di&s;|charges of bullets. The little pellet guns in the hands of children &s;hew al&s;o the force and &s;pring of the air; for one pel|let &s;topping the mouth of the gun at one end, and another being driven in at the oppo&s;ite end, the air contained in the bore of the gun between each pellet is
<PB N="98" REF="107">
continually conden&s;ing, as the hinder pellet is driven towards the foremo&s;t, till at la&s;t the &s;pring becomes &s;o great as to drive the foremo&s;t pellet forward with &s;ome noi&s;e and violence. In the large air-gun, however, the noi&s;e is by no means &s;o great: upon its di&s;charge no|thing is heard but a &s;ort of a ru&s;hing wind; and it is very po&s;&s;ible, that what we are vulgarly told of &s;ome men killing others by loading their pi&s;tols with dumb powder, might have proceeded from the &s;ilent effects of the air-gun.</P>
<P>THIS, however, is but an in&s;trument of curio&s;ity, and &s;ometimes of mi&s;chief; but upon the expan&s;ive &s;pring of the air it is that the fire-engine has been formed, a machine of the utmo&s;t benefit to man|kind in one of the mo&s;t terrible &s;ituations. This is u&s;ed for extingui&s;hing fires; for by means of the &s;pring of the air, which is conden&s;ed within the machine, the water is &s;purted out through a pipe to an height above the top of an ordinary hou&s;e;
<PB N="99" REF="108">
for water, as we &s;hall &s;ee, can be forced in a continued &s;tream not much higher, its parts &s;eparating, and the whole divid|ing into the &s;malle&s;t drops. That the me|chani&s;m of the fire-engine, or New&s;ham's engine, for he was the inventor, may be under&s;tood, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the machine in its &s;imple&s;t &s;tate, namely, the forcing pump, as it is called. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a common water-pump, &s;uch as we have already de&s;cribed, DA (&s;ee fig. 51.) rai&s;ing its water through the box H, upon lifting up the pi&s;ton D. But the pi&s;ton of the forcing pump differs from that of the common pump, in having no hole through it at <HI>d,</HI> as the other has: &s;o that it will not permit the water in the barrel BC by any means to get above it when it is depre&s;&s;ed to B. Therefore the water between the pi&s;ton <HI>g</HI> and the box H can get neither up nor down, neither through the pi&s;ton as it is not perforated, nor back through the box H, for the valve there clo&s;es again&s;t it;
<PB N="100" REF="109">
but it has a free pa&s;&s;age &s;ideways by the hole <HI>m n</HI> into the pipe M M, and this way it goes till it a&s;cends into the air ve&s;&s;el KK, up through the pipe at L. As it enters at P, there is a valve <HI>a,</HI> which permits it readily to enter, but never &s;uffers any to get back. The wa|ter then being thus forced into the air ve&s;&s;el KK, by repeated &s;trokes of the pi&s;ton, it ri&s;es above the lower end of the pipe GHI, and then begins to pre&s;s the air in the ve&s;&s;el KK into a narrower compa&s;s, and thus conden&s;ing it encrea&s;es its &s;pring. For the air has no way to get out of this ve&s;&s;el, the only open|ing it had was through the hole I at the bottom of the tube, and this is now co|vered up with water. The air there|fore is more and more pre&s;&s;ed, the more water is forced into the air ve&s;&s;el, till at length it begins to exert its &s;pring again&s;t the &s;urface of the water at H. This &s;pring therefore forces up the water through the pipe IHGF, from whence it &s;pouts in a jet S to a great height; and
<PB N="101" REF="110">
this may be continued as long as we chu&s;e to work the machine, and there is any wa|ter to &s;upply it. This in&s;trument was in u&s;e in miniature as a thing of mere curio&s;ity among naturali&s;ts, till the above ingenious and intelligent machini&s;t converted it to the mo&s;t u&s;eful purpo&s;es. If we &s;hould de|&s;ire to know, how the water may be driven in one of the&s;e in&s;truments, it is obvious, that the more the air in the ve&s;&s;el KK is pre&s;&s;ed, the more forcibly will it be driven through the pipe F. If the compre&s;&s;ion be equal to double the weight of the atmo&s;phere, the &s;pout will be thirty-three feet high; if the com|pre&s;&s;ion be three times greater than the weight of the atmo&s;phere, the &s;pout will be (all circum&s;tances the &s;ame) &s;ixty-&s;ix feet high; if four times, then ninety-nine feet high, and &s;o on. Thus, by encrea&s;ing the compre&s;&s;ion, the water will &s;pout higher, and this compre&s;&s;ion will be encrea&s;ed only by le&s;&s;ening the hole, by which the water is to e&s;cape from its force, or, in other words, by dimini&s;hing
<PB N="102" REF="111">
the diameter of the tube. But of this el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>THUS powerful is the expan&s;ive force of the air; but &s;till more powerful would it be if, by means of fire, we encrea&s;ed the ela&s;ticity of its parts, or their apti|tude to &s;eparate. It is an inconte&s;ted truth, that heat will expand air to a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing degree. Indeed, heat &s;erves to expand all bodies what&s;oever, but by no means in &s;uch great proportion as it does air. How heat comes to have this extraordinary power upon air we cannot tell: the cau&s;es of many things we are &s;trangers to, and mu&s;t be contented with knowing the phaenomena. Heat expands the air in an amazing degree, and cold, on the contrary, conden&s;es and contracts it. If, in proof of this, I hold a bladder half blown near the fire, the heat will &s;oon encrea&s;e the ela&s;ticity of the internal air, the bladder will &s;well, and at la&s;t bur&s;t. If I place a gla&s;s bubble filled with air in the fire, when
<PB N="103" REF="112">
the contents begin to rarefy with heat, the bubble will bur&s;t with a loud ex|plo&s;ion. So great is this expan&s;ion cau&s;ed in the air by heat, that &s;ome have been of opinion, that the air owed its expan&s;ive force only to the heat it con|tained; and as was &s;aid in a former chap|ter, if the air were deprived of all heat, it would quickly be conden&s;ed into a &s;o|lid ma&s;s. However this be, Amontons has found, that the heat of boiling water encrea&s;ed the force of air at lea&s;t a third part greater than it was before. And he al&s;o has proved, that the more den&s;e the air is, the more will an equal degree of heat expand it. If, for in&s;tance, a quart of air be conden&s;ed into a pint, an heat equal to that of boiling water will ope|rate twice more powerfully upon the compre&s;&s;ed pint, than upon the quart that is twice le&s;s compre&s;&s;ed. Thus we &s;ee with what force a &s;mall quantity of air may be made to pre&s;s upon the &s;urface of the earth, its weight from the height of the atmo&s;phere, its ela&s;ticity which is equal
<PB N="104" REF="113">
to that weight, and the encrea&s;ed ela&s;ti|city which it may receive from being heated. A &s;mall quantity of air acting with the&s;e three forces conjointly, might be able to cau&s;e an earthquake; but whether air thus expanding be actually the cau&s;e of earthquakes, we cannot de|termine: it is probable that it is not; but very po&s;&s;ible that it might be.</P>
<P>HOW great the power of the air is, though only acting with two of the&s;e forces, namely, its natural ela&s;ticity, and that which it acquires by heat, may be &s;een in the experiment of a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, which has received the name of Papin's Dige&s;ter. The effects of this dige&s;ter are perhaps &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing that experimental philo&s;ophy is ca|pable of exhibiting. The dige&s;ter is nothing more than an iron ve&s;&s;el of mo|derate thickne&s;s: into this is put meat, bone, hart&s;horn, or any other animal &s;ub&s;tance, and then the re&s;t of the ve&s;|&s;el is filled with water. Being thus filled,
<PB N="105" REF="114">
there is a cover, which is &s;crewed down clo&s;e upon the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el, &s;o that no air within the ve&s;&s;el can by any means e&s;cape, nor any of the exter|nal air enter. Then the whole is placed over the flame of a lamp, or up|on a few embers. In le&s;s than eight minutes time, the fle&s;h contained will be converted entirely into a liquor like &s;oup. By encrea&s;ing the fire a little more, or lengthening the time a few minutes longer, the harde&s;t bones will be di&s;&s;olved down into a jelly. This uten&s;il was fir&s;t invented by a philo&s;o|pher: it is at pre&s;ent chiefly converted to very unphilo&s;ophical purpo&s;es; for it is merely an in&s;trument of Epicuri&s;m and luxury. The French make their &s;oups with it, and we have of late brought it among our&s;elves from the elaboratory to the larder. When we con&s;ider the force which the air mu&s;t exert in thus brui&s;|ing down, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the harde&s;t bones in a few minutes into an impal|pable jelly, it may well excite our &s;ur|pri&s;e.
<PB N="106" REF="115">
The heavie&s;t hammer of an iron|work could not do it the fortieth part &s;o &s;oon. This in&s;trument, as we &s;aid, is called a Dige&s;ter, for it was brought by Papin to explain the manner in which our food was dige&s;ted in the &s;tomach, which he compared to this machine. He found, that in four and twenty hours an heat equal to that of the human body would di&s;&s;olve the harde&s;t bones in his dige&s;ter, and he therefore &s;uppo&s;ed, that the heat in the &s;tomach rarefying the air which was contained in the food, wrought the &s;ame change upon it, and di&s;&s;olved what we eat into a &s;ort of jelly, which is called chyle. A &s;ingle objec|tion de&s;troyed this whole theory. Fi&s;hes have no heat in their &s;tomachs, but yet dige&s;t very quickly. This therefore, like &s;everal former opinions, was &s;oon aban|doned. Boerhaave, finding any one of the former opinions unequal to the expla|nation of the work of dige&s;tion, pru|dently united them all: a method the
<PB N="107" REF="116">
fitte&s;t, if not of &s;atisfying curio&s;ity, at lea&s;t of concealing ignorance.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider this power, which heat has of rarefying the air, we cannot be &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at the con&s;tant changes of weight and ela&s;ticity, to which we find it liable; for, &s;etting a&s;ide the approach of the &s;un, the earth is conti|nually &s;ending up hot exhalations, which tend to rarefy the air in &s;ome places more than in others. The&s;e changes of the air is what, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, car|ries on the work of vegetation. Let us on|ly conceive the air as clo&s;ely enveloping the growing plant, and by its ela&s;ticity in&s;inuating it&s;elf continually into its pores. Its continual dilatation and con|traction will therefore take place upon entering the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of the plant; for as its den&s;ity is never found in na|ture two minutes together the &s;ame, it will be varying within the plant ju&s;t as it was before its entrance. Thus in every plant there is a continual vibration of
<PB N="108" REF="117">
parts, the air contracting and dilating with the minute&s;t variations of heat and cold. And thus it is that the juices are driven forward through their channels, and the whole work of vegetation is carried regularly on. And hence al&s;o it is, that plants will not vegetate in the void. I have often &s;een in a clear &s;un|&s;hiny day all the objects of nature as if trembling before my eyes. This is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the ri&s;ing of vapours; perhaps with more probability it may be attributed to this alternate expan&s;ion and contraction of the air. This undu|lation is very manife&s;t in the &s;piracles of many plants viewed with the micro&s;cope. We find a &s;imilar undulation in the parts of light. From analogy we may a&s;cribe &s;uch &s;imilar motion to the alternate expan&s;ion and contraction of the air. At the wor&s;t, if it be an error, the error is but &s;mall, for the enquiry is of little importance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Atmo&s;phere and its Height.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een the manner in which the air &s;u&s;pends quick&s;ilver in the empty tube to the height of about twenty-nine inches, and water to the height of about thirty-two feet: the quick&s;ilver or water, however, as we &s;aid, does not always ri&s;e to the &s;ame height: the quick&s;ilver, for in&s;tance, alters &s;o as to be three inches lower, or three inches higher, at one time than at another. So that in the barometer or weather-gla&s;s there is a variation of three inches at lea&s;t between its highe&s;t and its lowe&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. The&s;e changes, as we al&s;o ob&s;erved, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the alte|ration of the weight of the air, &s;ome|times pre&s;&s;ing the external quick&s;ilver with greater, &s;ometimes with le&s;&s;er force. If the quick&s;ilver always &s;tood at the &s;ame height, that is, exactly at twenty-nine
<PB N="110" REF="119">
inches, the weight of a pillar of the atmo&s;phere would be concluded to be invariable; and, as we &s;hewed before, would be equal to a pillar of quick&s;ilver twenty-nine inches high, and it would weigh above thirty thou&s;and pounds; but as the barometer is continually altering, it is plain the weight of the atmo&s;phere is altering al&s;o, in&s;omuch that it is near one tenth more heavy at one time than at another. For &s;uppo&s;e, when the air is lighte&s;t, we at one time &s;u&s;tain a weight equal to a pillar of quick&s;ilver twenty-eight inches high, it is obvious that when, at another time, this pillar is encrea&s;ed by three inches of quick&s;il|ver more, this will make our load near one tenth part more; or, in other words, if we at one time &s;u&s;tain a pillar of air equal in weight to twenty-eight of the&s;e inches, which in round numbers is near thirty thou&s;and pound, we &s;hall at an|other time, when the air is heavie&s;t, be loaded with a pillar of air equal to thirty-one inches of quick&s;ilver, which will add
<PB N="111" REF="120">
to our load of thirty thou&s;and pound, near one tenth, that is, make it thirty-three thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P>SUCH is the difference of weight, which we in&s;en&s;ibly &s;u&s;tain at one time more than at another. Of the encrea&s;e of this pre&s;&s;ure other animals &s;eem much more &s;en&s;ible than we: crows, for in|&s;tance, as the poet has remarked, by their cawing &s;urely foretel a change of wea|ther: their more poignant &s;en&s;ations di&s;|cover the approaching alteration, which perhaps the luxury, and artificial heats, to which we have accu&s;tomed our&s;elves, have deprived us of. Certain it is, that in &s;ome parts of India, where the Joque&s;e prie&s;ts never eat animal food, nor ever enter hou&s;es, their &s;en&s;ations of ap|proaching change in the weather are &s;aid to be exqui&s;ite: they feel its weight, and their &s;mell di&s;covers its alterations. It is common among them, when de|&s;cribing the beauties of a place, to rank
<PB N="112" REF="121">
among the number the exqui&s;ite <HI>ta&s;te</HI> of its air.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that the greatne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere's weight did not affect us with a &s;en&s;e of any oppre&s;&s;ion, and we may remark the &s;ame with re|gard to the encrea&s;e of this weight. Na|ture hath wi&s;ely armed us again&s;t this change, and in proportion as the atmo|&s;phere is laid upon us with additional oppre&s;&s;ion, the heart beats quicker again&s;t it, and drives the compre&s;&s;ed fluids of the body with greater force. Why the heart thus bounds more &s;trongly when the weight of the atmo&s;phere is greate&s;t, we can but ob&s;curely tell: it is an en|quiry rather belonging to the medical phy&s;iologi&s;t, than to the natural philo&s;o|pher. To whom&s;oever it belongs, the inve&s;tigation is ab&s;tru&s;e, and the &s;olution difficult.</P>
<P>AS we know with &s;ome preci&s;ion the weight of our atmo&s;phere, &s;o &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers
<PB N="113" REF="122">
have pur&s;ued &s;peculation, and attempted to di&s;cover its height al&s;o. Geometricians love to pur&s;ue a &s;ubject where calculation is all that is nece&s;&s;ary; for this rea&s;on we have had many &s;olutions of this que&s;tion, and all dif|ferent from each other.</P>
<P>IF the air was not ela&s;tic, but throughout of the &s;ame den&s;ity from the &s;urface of the earth to the top of the at|mo&s;phere, like water, which is equally den&s;e at every height, it would then be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to mea&s;ure the height of the atmo&s;phere. We might then proceed certainly and &s;afely thus. We have only to find out the proportion between the height of a &s;hort pillar of air, and a &s;mall pillar of water of equal weight; and having compared the proportion the heights of the&s;e bear to each other in the &s;mall, the &s;ame proportion will be &s;ure to hold in the great, between a pillar of wa|ter thirty-two feet high, and a pillar of air that reaches to the top of the atmo|&s;phere,
<PB N="114" REF="123">
who&s;e height I want to know. Thus, for in&s;tance, we find that a certain weight of water reaches one inch high, and a &s;imilar weight of air reaches &s;even|ty-two feet high: this then is the pro|portion two &s;uch pillars bear to each other in the &s;mall. Now, if one inch of water be equal to &s;eventy-two feet of air, to how much air will thirty-two feet of water be equal. By the common rule of proportion, I rea|dily find, that thirty-two feet, or 384 inches of water, will be equal to 331,776 inches, which makes &s;omething more than five miles, which would be the height of the atmo&s;phere, were its den|&s;ity every where the &s;ame as at the earth, where &s;eventy-two feet of air were equal to one inch of water.</P>
<P>BUT this is not really the ca&s;e; for the air's den&s;ity, as we &s;hewed before, is not every where the &s;ame, but decrea&s;es as the pre&s;&s;ure upon it decrea&s;es; &s;o that the air becomes lighter and lighter the
<PB N="115" REF="124">
higher we a&s;cend, and at the upper part of the atmo&s;phere, where the pre&s;&s;ure is &s;carce any thing at all, the air dilating in proportion, mu&s;t be expanded to a &s;ur|pri&s;ing degree; and therefore the height of the atmo&s;phere mu&s;t be much greater than has appeared by the la&s;t calculation, in which its den&s;ity was &s;uppo&s;ed to be every where as great as at the &s;urface of the earth. In order therefore to deter|mine the height of the atmo&s;phere more exactly, geometricians have endeavour|ed to determine the den&s;ity of the air at different di&s;tances from the earth. The following &s;ketch will give an idea of the method which &s;ome geometricians have taken to determine this den&s;ity, which is preparatory to finding out the height of the atmo&s;phere more exactly.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a pillar of air to reach from the top of the atmo&s;phere down to the earth's &s;urface; and let us al&s;o &s;up|po&s;e it marked like a &s;tandard by inches, from the top to the bottom; let us &s;till

farther &s;uppo&s;e, that each inch of air, if not at all compre&s;&s;ed, would weigh one grain. The topmo&s;t inch then weighs one grain, as it &s;uffers no compre&s;&s;ure what&s;oever; the &s;econd inch is pre&s;&s;ed by the topmo&s;t with a weight of one grain, and this added to its own natural weight or den&s;ity of one grain, now makes its den&s;ity, which is ever equal to the pre&s;&s;ure, two grains. The third inch is pre&s;&s;ed down by the weight of the two inches above it, who&s;e weights united make three grains, and the&s;e add|ed to its natural weight, give it a den|&s;ity of four grains. The fourth inch is pre&s;&s;ed by the united weight of the three above it, which together make &s;even grains, and this added to its natural weight give it a den&s;ity of eight grains. The fifth inch, being pre&s;|&s;ed by all the former fifteen, and its own weight, added, gives it a den&s;ity of &s;ix|teen grains, and &s;o on, de&s;cending down|wards to the bottom. The fir&s;t inch has a den&s;ity of one, the &s;econd inch a den|&s;ity
<PB N="117" REF="126">
of two, the third inch, a den&s;ity of four, the fourth inch of eight, the fifth of &s;ixteen, and &s;o on. Thus the inches of air increa&s;e in den&s;ity as they de&s;cend from the top, at the rate of one, two, four, eight, &s;ixteen, thirty-two, &s;ix|ty-four, and &s;o on, which is called a geo|metrical progre&s;&s;ion. Or if we have a mind to take this backwards, and begin at the bottom, we may &s;ay, that the den|&s;ity of each of the&s;e inches grows le&s;s upwards in a geometrical progre&s;&s;ion. If, in&s;tead of inches, we &s;uppo&s;e the parts into which this pillar of air is divided to be extremely &s;mall, like tho&s;e of air, the rule will hold good in the&s;e as well as tho&s;e. So that we may generally a&s;|&s;ert, that the den&s;ity of the air, from the &s;urface of the earth, decrea&s;es in a geo|metrical proportion.</P>
<P>THIS being under&s;tood, &s;hould I now de&s;ire to know the den&s;ity of the air at any certain height, I have only fir&s;t to find out how much the den&s;ity of the air
<PB N="118" REF="127">
is dimini&s;hed to a certain &s;tandard height, and from thence proceed to tell how much it will be dimini&s;hed at the greate&s;t heights that can be imagined. At &s;mall heights the diminution of its den&s;ity is by fractional or broken numbers. We will &s;uppo&s;e at once then, for greater ea&s;e, that at the height of five miles, or a Dutch league, the air is twice le&s;s den&s;e than at the &s;urface of the earth: then, at two leagues high, it mu&s;t be four times thinner and le&s;s den&s;e, and at three leagues eight times thinner and lighter, and &s;o on. In&s;tead of Dutch leagues, &s;uppo&s;e we took a German league of &s;e|ven miles, and that it was four times le&s;s den&s;e at the height of the fir&s;t German league, then it would decrea&s;e in the &s;ame proportion, and be four times le&s;s den&s;e than the fir&s;t at the &s;econd league, that is &s;ixteen times; and four times le&s;s den&s;e than the &s;econd at the third league, that is &s;ixty-four times; and four times le&s;s den&s;e than the third at the fourth league, that is two hundred and fifty-&s;ix
<PB N="119" REF="128">
times le&s;s den&s;e than at the &s;urface. In &s;hort, whatever decrea&s;e it received in the fir&s;t &s;tep, it will continue to have in the &s;ame proportion in the &s;econd, third, and &s;o on; and this, as we &s;aid, is called geometrical progre&s;&s;ion. They who are fond of calculations may go &s;till forward, calculating the height of the air in this manner, and they will find, that a cubic inch of &s;uch air as we breathe here below would be &s;o very much rarefied at the height of five hundred miles, that it would fill a &s;phere equal in magnitude to the farthe&s;t reach of our planetary &s;y&s;tem. Calculations, how|ever, confer but little wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>BY this method of calculating the den&s;ity of the air, we find that the height of the atmo&s;phere is &s;carce to be deter|mined, as it grows thinner the higher it a&s;cends. However, I think it may be ea&s;ily enough proved, that it cannot dif|fu&s;e it&s;elf above a certain determined height; for it mu&s;t be noted, that the air is attracted by gravity to the earth,
<PB N="120" REF="129">
all the time it is thus impelled to recede from it by its expan&s;ive force. Now, if its den&s;ity, and con&s;equently its ex|pan&s;ive force, which is equal, be ninety hundred thou&s;and million times le&s;s at one hundred miles from the earth, than at its &s;urface, as is nearly the ca&s;e; and if, on the other hand, the power of gravity &s;hould be but a &s;ingle tenth part le&s;s at an hundred miles di&s;tance, than it is at the &s;urface of the earth, it is evi|dent, that the power of gravity will be|come at la&s;t greater than the force of expan&s;ion, and at a certain height the air, in&s;tead of &s;uffering farther expan|&s;ion, will be attracted towards the earth. For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e a bubble of air at the &s;urface of the earth weighs but the millionth part of a grain, &s;uppo&s;e it rai&s;ed &s;eventy miles high, its weight or gravity will &s;carce be dimini&s;hed at all, but its den&s;ity, and con&s;equently its expan&s;ive force, will be a million times le&s;s than before. Suppo&s;e then it is rai&s;ed &s;eventy-&s;even miles high, this will make &s;carce any alteration in its gravity; but its
<PB N="121" REF="130">
den&s;ity, and con&s;equently its expan&s;ive force, will be four million times le&s;s. Here then the gravitating force exceeds the expan&s;ive force by three millions, and con&s;equently the particles of air, in&s;tead of attempting to ri&s;e by expan|&s;ion, will be carried down by the &s;upe|rior force of gravity. In other words, the atmo&s;phere cannot ri&s;e above &s;eventy miles high at the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed, that this theory were a&s;certained by experiment, and that upon examining the diminution of the air's den&s;ity at three different heights, as in the valley, on the brow of a high moun|tain, and on its &s;ummit, we found the den&s;ity of the air thus decrea&s;ing in geo|metrical proportion. Were the theory thus inconte&s;tably a&s;certained, and found conformable to facts, we might ea&s;ily mea&s;ure the heights of mountains merely by knowing the den&s;ity of the air, and the air's den&s;ity could always be ea&s;ily found by the barometer. Derham, if I re|member right, was the fir&s;t who thought
<PB N="122" REF="131">
upon this method of mea&s;uring the heights of mountains by the barometer. He attempted to mea&s;ure the hill of Snowdon in this manner: however, he &s;uppo&s;ed the atmo&s;phere of an equal den|&s;ity throughout. Others have taken its geometrically decrea&s;ing den&s;ity into con&s;ideration, and laid down rules for thus mea&s;uring mountains by calculating their heights, in proportion to the de|crea&s;e of the air's den&s;ity. The thing is ea&s;ily enough done; but at pre&s;ent, the whole of the method is looked upon as matter rather curious than either u&s;eful or exact. Ca&s;&s;ini the younger, in his admea&s;urement of a degree in France, calculated the den&s;ities of the air at &s;e|veral heights, upon different mountains; and he found the den&s;ity of the air decrea&s;e in a much greater proportion as he a&s;|cended, than in the geometrical progre&s;|&s;ion which the theory had laid down. The publication of the&s;e experiments cau&s;ed a &s;chi&s;m among naturali&s;ts. Some have a&s;cribed this difference between experiment and theory to the vapours
<PB N="123" REF="132">
being in greater abundance in the valley than on the mountain, and as the&s;e va|pours neither ri&s;e to the heights of pure air, nor act with equal ela&s;ticity, the air upon the tops of mountains being freed from the&s;e is more expanded, and con|&s;equently le&s;s den&s;e. This is denied by others, particularly Fontenelle: he a&s;|&s;erts, that the air is more rare upon the tops of mountains, becau&s;e there it has more ela&s;ticity, and it has there more ela&s;ti|city becau&s;e it has more humidity; but Dr. Jurin has well confuted this by &s;hew|ing, that humidity by no means in|crea&s;es the ela&s;ticity of the air. Others there are, who make a di&s;tinction be|tween the air on the mountain, and the air in the valley, and who think that they are governed by different laws. Such is the &s;tate of the controver&s;y as it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Philo&s;ophers di&s;pute, but chance more frequently decides.</P>
<P>THIS method of determining the height of the atmo&s;phere, though per|haps
<PB N="124" REF="133">
the be&s;t, is yet di&s;liked by Ber|nouilli, who gives us a method of his own. The heat in the air is reckoned by him as one of the agents in producing its dif|ferent den&s;ities. This method, however, is not much followed: the manner of finding out its height, as given by Kep|ler, is mo&s;t known and followed, though perhaps built, like the re&s;t, upon a ba&s;e|le&s;s foundation. Kepler's method is this.</P>
<P>ASTRONOMERS know, to the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, the place of the heavens in which the &s;un is at any one moment of time: they know, for in&s;tance, the moment in which it will &s;et, and al&s;o the preci&s;e time in which it is about to ri&s;e. However, upon awaiting his ap|pearance any morning, they always &s;ee the light of the &s;un before its body, and they &s;ee the &s;un it&s;elf &s;ome minutes &s;ooner above the mountain top, than it ought to appear from their calculations. Twilight they &s;ee long before the &s;un
<PB N="125" REF="134">
appears, and that at a time when they know that it is eighteen degrees lower than the verge of the &s;ky. There is then in this ca&s;e &s;omething which deceives our &s;ight; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un to be &s;o irregular in his motions as to vary every morning: this would di&s;turb the regularity of nature. The deception actu|ally exi&s;ts in the atmo&s;phere. By look|ing through this den&s;e, tran&s;parent &s;ub|&s;tance, every cele&s;tial object that lies be|yond it is &s;eemingly rai&s;ed up, in &s;ome &s;uch manner as we &s;ee a piece of money look as if rai&s;ed higher in a ba&s;on filled with water. From hence it is plain, that if the atmo&s;phere were away, the &s;un's light would not be brought to view &s;o long in the morning before the &s;un it&s;elf actually appears. The &s;un, with|out the atmo&s;phere, would appear all blazing in light the in&s;tant it ro&s;e, and leave us in total darkne&s;s the in&s;tant of its &s;etting. The length of the twilight, therefore, is in proportion to the height of the atmo&s;phere; or let us
<PB N="126" REF="135">
invert this and &s;ay, that the height of the atmo&s;phere is in proportion to the length of the twilight. So that the di&s;tance there is between the real and the apparent place of the &s;un's ray will &s;erve to mea&s;ure the height of the atmo&s;phere; for let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un to be at S, and the eye of a &s;pectator upon the earth at A. Now the &s;pectator cannot &s;ee the &s;un, but yet he will &s;ee the light reflected by the atmo|&s;phere; for when the ray of the &s;un touches the earth at D, (&s;ee fig. 52.) and goes &s;till forward, as &s;oon as it arrives at B it will bend &s;lanting to the &s;pectator's eye at A; by which he enjoys the light before the &s;un appears. This ray has touched the earth at D and at A, and the arch DA is comprehended between the two tangents. If a line be drawn from the centre of the earth, &s;o as to divide this arch in two equal parts, from the nature of all circles, as geometry a&s;&s;ures us, it mu&s;t come upon the place where the ray was bended at B, and the length of the line HB will be the height of the atmo|&s;phere,
<PB N="127" REF="136">
which even a common &s;urveyor may ea&s;ily find. It is generally found by this means to be about forty-five miles high. All this holds, &s;uppo&s;ing the rays to be &s;traight or direct as they pa&s;s through the atmo&s;phere, which in fact they are not. Kepler was the fir&s;t who found out this, but he &s;oon abandoned it, becau&s;e it made the atmo&s;phere many times higher than he really thought it was.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, twilight is one of the great ble&s;&s;ings we derive from our atmo&s;phere: by it we are by gentle de|grees brought from darkne&s;s into light, and again from light into darkne&s;s. In tho&s;e countries towards the poles, where, though the &s;un di&s;appears totally for a &s;ea&s;on, yet, when not above eighteen de|grees below their horizon, they have the twilight all night long. At the equator, the twilight is &s;horte&s;t, becau&s;e the rays of the &s;un dart mo&s;t directly through the atmo&s;phere, and con&s;equent|ly are le&s;s refracted by pa&s;&s;ing through
<PB N="128" REF="137">
it; but even allowing the whole of this computation to be exact, which however the learned now begin to doubt of, yet there mu&s;t be allowance &s;till made for the alterations in the den&s;ity of the at|mo&s;phere; for the den&s;er it is, the greater will be its power of refracting the light, and we &s;hewed before that cold will encrea&s;e its den&s;ity. In Nova Zem|bla, where the air is extremely cold, the refracting power of the atmo&s;phere is &s;o great, that &s;ome Hollanders, who win|tered there, were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;un &s;eventeen days before they expected to &s;ee him, even allowing for the influence of the atmo&s;phere, as a&s;tronomers u&s;u|ally do. There is another appearance in the heavens u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the atmo&s;phere, the largene&s;s of the ri&s;ing or &s;etting &s;un or moon, and their oval ap|pearance; but as the&s;e can be explained only by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of optics, they mu&s;t be re&s;erved for that part of natural phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of <HI>WINDS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have already repre&s;ented the atmo&s;phere as in continual mo|tion, alternately relaxed by heat, and contracted by cold, as the &s;un, our &s;ource of cele&s;tial heat, acts upon it, or the hot or cold exhalations from the earth contribute to encrea&s;e its warmth or to dimini&s;h it.</P>
<P>IF we &s;hould move with great &s;peed again&s;t the air, we &s;hould feel its force: the &s;ame thing will happen if the air moves with &s;wiftne&s;s again&s;t us: we feel it forcibly impre&s;&s;ed upon our bo|dies, and the air thus moving all know to be called Wind. The wind is nothing el&s;e but the air put violently into mo|tion, and the more &s;wift this motion, and the more den&s;e the air, the greater the wind's force, and if to a great de|gree, it is then called a Storm.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="140">IF we &s;uppo&s;e the atmo&s;phere heated in any one part more violently than in another, it is plain, that this will dilate it, and drive the air out of that part. The air, however, cannot be thus driven from its own peculiar place without making an excur&s;ion into the place which another body of air po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. By this means a great quantity of air will be crowded or conden&s;ed into one particular region, while another &s;hall have but very little. This inequality of the air in the&s;e two different regions mu&s;t continue as long as the one of them continues more heated by the &s;un or by vapours than the other. But when the cau&s;e of the inequality is re|moved, and the heat is equally mode|rate in both places, the air conden&s;ed in one place having nothing now to re&s;i&s;t its pre&s;&s;ure, will ru&s;h into the place empty of air, and thus flowing in with a violent motion produce winds, &s;uch as we every hour experience. To have a clear conception of this, let us compare that particular &s;pot or place where all the
<PB N="132" REF="141">
air is ju&s;t in a manner exhau&s;ted by heat to a great empty gulf, into which fluids are going to enter from every &s;ide. The inhabitants in the mid&s;t of the gulf are pre&s;&s;ed violently by the &s;tream on every &s;ide: tho&s;e who are to the north of it, &s;ee the &s;tream of air directed towards the &s;outh, that is, they have a north wind: tho&s;e on the contrary, who live to the &s;outhward, &s;ee the &s;tream going northwards, and therefore have a &s;outh wind, and &s;o of all the other points of the compa&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the gulf, where all the &s;treams meet and mix, they feel all the inconveniences which are the effects of that heterogeneous mixture. There &s;ulphureous exhalations from the &s;outh, torrents of nitre from the north, and watery vapours from every &s;ide, are indi&s;criminately blended together in one confu&s;ed ma&s;s. From hence proceed tempe&s;ts, thunder, rain, hail, and whirl|winds.</P>
<P>BUT though winds are thus found to produce mi&s;chief, yet the harm they
<PB N="133" REF="142">
do bears no proportion to the good we experience from them. The atmo&s;phere of a large city, if continually the &s;ame, would &s;oon become corrupt, and from the quantity of animal exhalations float|ing in it, would in a very few days, perhaps hours, de&s;troy the health of the inhabitants. The wind prevents this, and blows away this over-charged part of the atmo&s;phere, placing a new co|lumn of atmo&s;phere in its room.</P>
<P>THESE currents of air are al&s;o bene|ficial in another re&s;pect, for they often cool the atmo&s;phere when too much heated. Tho&s;e places, which have but ju&s;t before felt the mo&s;t violent effects of heat, are refre&s;hed by the air which comes from a colder region. On the other hand, the air, which by heat has been forced from the warmer region into that which is more cold, reciprocally bene|fits that, and &s;oftens the &s;everity of its natural atmo&s;phere. The inhabitants of tho&s;e i&s;lands that lie in hot tropical cli|mates
<PB N="134" REF="143">
feel the&s;e benefits mo&s;t &s;ignally from the wind. All day the &s;un beat|ing with &s;everity again&s;t the &s;olid earth of the i&s;land, cau&s;es this, like all hard &s;ub|&s;tances, to be greatly heated, and the air con&s;equently rarefied to a great degree. In the mean time, the air upon the &s;ur|face of &s;o great and &s;o fluid a body as the &s;urrounding ocean, is by no means &s;o much rarefied, but lies out cool at &s;ea, and con&s;equently healthful. As &s;oon, therefore, as the &s;un every day has done exerting the violence of his heat, the air from the ocean pours in upon the inhabitants panting and faint for want of air, and at once comforts, cools, and refre&s;hes them. Thus every four-and-twenty hours they have two regular and &s;tated winds. In the morn|ing, while the &s;un is driving off the air from land, the wind blows out to &s;ea; on the contrary, when the &s;un's power is over, and he has done his ta&s;k, at night the air from the &s;ea ru&s;hes back to fill the &s;pace the &s;un had made empty.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="144">IN this manner, however irregular we find the wind in this &s;till happier climate, they have it a more con&s;tant and more grateful vi&s;itant; yet the con&s;tancy of the wind among the i&s;lands is but a trifle, if compared to what it is found to blow in the open parts of the ocean between the tropics; for in gene|ral, within the whole torrid zone, an ea&s;t wind is found to prevail throughout the whole year: &s;o that if a &s;hip &s;hould &s;ail away from the coa&s;t of Africa, and go continually we&s;tward, it would have an ea&s;tern gale to carry it round the whole globe. From its being &s;o fa|vourable to navigation, this wind has been called a Trade Wind.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this con&s;tancy in the trade winds has been variou&s;ly accounted for. Very many, and very ab&s;urd have been the conjectures brought to explain them. There is a weed, &s;ays Ly&s;|ter, growing in the &s;ea, called <HI>alga marina,</HI> and extremely abundant in
<PB N="136" REF="145">
the tropical climates. The per&s;pirations of this weed produce air, and this air produces the trade winds, and the&s;e trade winds are always con&s;tant, becau&s;e they are always produced from the &s;ame plant. This is &s;ufficiently ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>DR. GORDON, with more probability, a&s;cribed the trade wind to the motion of the earth upon its axle; but none of the motions of a fluid at the earth's &s;ur|face can be a&s;cribed to that cau&s;e. Others were willing to a&s;cribe them to the &s;ame cau&s;es that produced the tides, the &s;un and moon's attraction. But it might be geometrically proved, that this attraction would not cau&s;e the air to ri&s;e much higher than it does the ocean, which in the air would be &s;o trifling a difference, that it could cau&s;e no &s;en&s;ible alteration whatever in the direction of the winds. It is to Dr. Halley we owe the mo&s;t rational theory upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">HE explains the cau&s;e of the trade|winds in general terms thus: the air is more rarefied between the tropics, be|cau&s;e a greater quantity of the &s;un's rays fall in that region, and becau&s;e they fall more directly, and al&s;o becau&s;e it is that part of the earth which is actually nearer the &s;un. Now, as the &s;un travels on|ward from ea&s;t to we&s;t every day, he dilates mo&s;t that part of the atmo|&s;phere that is immediately under him, and &s;o makes a kind of a void &s;pace as he goes along; but it is very obvious, that the air behind him will ru&s;h in to fill up this &s;pace that he has ju&s;t left, rather than the air which is before his motion: for if the air before his motion ru&s;hed for|ward to fill up the cha&s;m he has ju&s;t made, it mu&s;t pa&s;s directly under his rays, and if &s;o it would it&s;elf by that means be di|lated, and &s;o rendered unfit to fill up the void place it was ru&s;hing in to occupy. For this rea&s;on, therefore, the air mu&s;t follow the &s;un's motion, and fill each cha&s;m he has ju&s;t made; in other words,
<PB N="138" REF="147">
the trade-winds mu&s;t move from ea&s;t to we&s;t. From hence, therefore, between the tropics, there would always be a current of air due ea&s;t; but we are to take another effect into con&s;ideration. The den&s;e air from the north and &s;outh poles is always ru&s;hing into the rarefied regions of the equator. Here the&s;e two oppo&s;ite winds meeting with that which continually blows due ea&s;t, they in &s;ome mea&s;ure flow in its current, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure keep their own current. On the north &s;ide of the equator the wind blows north-ea&s;t; on the &s;outh &s;ide of the equator it con&s;tantly blows &s;outh-ea&s;t; and this is really the ca&s;e with the trade-winds, which lie over the open part of the ocean, and which are not affected by the heat, which the &s;un &s;triking again&s;t &s;ome neighbour|ing continent might produce.</P>
<P>I SAY in the open parts of the ocean; for in tho&s;e parts of it crowded with i&s;lands, or lying near continents, the trade-winds are by no means &s;o regular. Earth is a more hard body than water;
<PB N="139" REF="148">
hard bodies receive a &s;tronger heat than tho&s;e which are fluid; an iron heated red-hot is much hotter than water at its highe&s;t pitch of heat; the earth, as being an harder body than the ocean, receives more of the &s;un's rays, and reflects them with greater violence. Thus the air over a large continent is much more heated, and therefore more dilated, than over an ocean. This difference, therefore, produces what mariners in tho&s;e cli|mates call the Land-wind. Every day, while the &s;un heats the earth, and thus produces a dilatation, the air is in a man|ner driven out to &s;ea; but at night, when this heat cea&s;es, the &s;ea-breeze blows in upon land to fill up the void cau&s;ed by the diurnal &s;olar heat. Thus it is where there are continents, or i&s;lands, lying between the tropics: by day the wind blows out from &s;hore; by night, it blows back again the contrary way, and mariners find it dangerous to at|tempt landing at that time; but it is otherwi&s;e where the ocean is open.

is the regularity of the trade-winds, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, that from the mo&s;t we&s;tern coa&s;t of America acro&s;s the great Pacific Ocean to the Philippine I&s;lands, is but a voyage of nine weeks; for the ocean is almo&s;t without i&s;land, and the winds upon its &s;urface blow continually the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>SUCH therefore is the nature of the winds, that if the earth were all over covered with one deep ocean, the winds upon its &s;urface would always blow the &s;ame way on either &s;ide of the equator, and the motion of the air would regu|larly pur&s;ue the motion of the &s;un; but in the earth's pre&s;ent &s;tate, there are numberle&s;s cau&s;es to interrupt their re|gularity, and more in our colder cli|mates than in tho&s;e burning regions that are more immediately &s;ubject to the &s;un's influence. In the&s;e there is a kind of interrupted regularity in the winds, but with us nothing can be more irregu|lar than they are. The &s;un is &s;eldom &s;o
<PB N="141" REF="150">
extremely powerful in the temperate zone, as to counteract the incon&s;tant and uncertain impre&s;&s;ions of different exha|lations upon the wind, and thus give regularity to its motions. Vapours, meteors, mountains, fore&s;ts, lakes, cities, all con&s;pire to give a new direction to the current of the air, and alter the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. The cau&s;es that give irregularity to winds with us are nu|merous, while the &s;un, that in the tor|rid climates regulates their motion, ope|rates here with dimini&s;hed influence. We have not yet, therefore, a &s;ufficient hi&s;tory of the changes wrought by the&s;e different cau&s;es upon the wind in our own climates; and until &s;uch an hi&s;tory, which mu&s;t be the work of more than an age, can be compiled, no certainty is to be expected in our predictions of the changes it may undergo. Bacon was the fir&s;t who undertook to write an hi&s;|tory of the wind: his great &s;pirit was deterred at no difficulty in the way; he began the edifice, and &s;ucceeding philo|&s;ophers,
<PB N="142" REF="151">
in&s;tead of pur&s;uing his great de&s;ign, have left it &s;tanding ju&s;t at the height he left it. They have added &s;carce any new ob&s;ervations to en|large the work. Had his plan been carried on with the &s;ame &s;pirit with which he began it, the variations of the weather might now perhaps have been determined with greater certainty, and who knows but by this time we might have been able to predict a north or a &s;outh wind, with as much exactne&s;s as we now calculate an eclip&s;e. To predict an eclip&s;e is an object merely of curio&s;ity; to predict an approaching &s;torm would be of inconceivable benefit. The time &s;pent in determining the figure of a <HI>tautochrone</HI> might have been more u&s;e|fully employed in this re&s;earch. I &s;hall conclude this chapter with the &s;ketch of an hi&s;tory of the winds, &s;uch as he has left it, with &s;ome few additions by Halley, Buffon, D'Alembert, and others.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="152">AT &s;ea the winds are more regular than at land; for there nothing oppo&s;es their progre&s;s, or alters the &s;un's in|fluence.</P>
<P>THE air at &s;ea is more equable, as well as more con&s;tant: at land it blows in &s;its of force and intermi&s;&s;ion; but at &s;ea the current is &s;trong, &s;teady, and even.</P>
<P>IN general, at &s;ea, on this &s;ide the equator, the ea&s;t and north winds are mo&s;t violent and boi&s;terous: on the con|trary, at land, the we&s;t and &s;outh winds are mo&s;t &s;ubject to produce hurricanes and tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE air is often &s;een to move in two contrary currents, and this almo&s;t ever previous to thunder. The clouds, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, are &s;een to move one way, while the weathercock points another.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="153">THE winds are more violent at cer|tain heights than upon the plain, and the higher we a&s;cend lofty mountains, the greater is the force of the wind, till we get above the ordinary heights of the clouds. Above this the &s;ky is u&s;u|ally &s;erene and clear. The rea&s;on is, that the wind, at the &s;urface of the earth, is continually interrupted by hills and ri&s;ings: &s;o that, on the plain, between any two of the&s;e, the inhabitants are in a kind of &s;helter; but when once the interpo&s;ition of &s;mall hills no longer &s;tops the wind's cour&s;e, it then becomes &s;tronger, as the interruptions it meets with are fewer. At the tops of the high|er mountains its interruptions are lea&s;t of all; but it does not blow with vio|lence there: for its den&s;ity is &s;o much dimini&s;hed by the height, that its force is &s;carce perceivable, and the &s;torm falls midway below.</P>
<P>A current of air always augments in force in proportion as the pa&s;&s;age through
<PB N="145" REF="154">
which it runs is dimini&s;hed. The law of this augmentation is, that the air's force is compounded of its &s;wiftne&s;s and den|&s;ity, and as the&s;e are encrea&s;ed, &s;o will the force of the wind. If any quan|tity of wind moves with twice the &s;wift|ne&s;s of a &s;imilar quantity, it will be twice as forceful; but if, at the &s;ame time that it is twice as &s;wift, it moves through twice a &s;maller tube, and the &s;ides of the canal give no re&s;i&s;tance to its motion, it will be four times as forceful. This, however, is not entirely the ca&s;e; for the &s;ides of the tube give a re&s;i&s;tance, and retard its motion, in a proportion that is not ea&s;ily calculated. From this increa&s;e of the wind's den&s;ity in blowing through narrow pa&s;&s;ages, it is that we &s;ee the &s;torms &s;o very violent that &s;ometime blow between two neigh|bouring hills. It is from this, that when caught in long arcades opening at one end, the wind blows with great force along them. From this increa&s;ed den|&s;ity it is, that we meet with &s;uch cold
<PB N="146" REF="155">
bla&s;ts at the corners of &s;treets. In &s;hort, whatever dimini&s;hes its bulk, without taking entirely away from its motion, increa&s;es the vehemence of the wind. This al&s;o is the rea&s;on why the air re|flected back from the &s;ide of a moun|tain is often more violent than the air which fir&s;t &s;truck its &s;ide; for it is by this means conden&s;ed, and its force augmented. The countrymen and far|mers have a di&s;tinction which is not without its foundation; for they make a difference between a &s;wift and an heavy &s;torm: the &s;wift &s;torm is loud, boi&s;te|rous, and inoffen&s;ive; the heavy &s;torm more &s;o, but more forceful and dange|rous. This &s;hews the in&s;ufficiency of tho&s;e in&s;truments made for mea&s;uring winds, by mea&s;uring the rapidity only with which they move. The&s;e machines for mea&s;uring the &s;wiftne&s;s of the wind are called Anemometers, an ill-&s;ound|ing word made from Greek.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="156">MR. BUFFON has divided the winds by zones: the frigid zone is the parent of north winds, and ea&s;t winds rule at the equator. The winds of the tempe|rate zone are compo&s;ed of the eddies of the&s;e two united. As the north wind prevails over the ea&s;t wind, it produces a we&s;t wind; as the ea&s;t wind prevails, it produces a wind from the &s;outh. The&s;e, however, are reflected, refracted, and at la&s;t de&s;troyed by each other's op|po&s;ition in every region: their force is greate&s;t when &s;everal winds con&s;pire to move in the &s;ame current.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. Of Mu&s;ical Sounds.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of &s;ounds adds infi|nitely more to the happine&s;s of man than to that of all other animals: it not only &s;upplies him, like them, with expre&s;&s;ions of his wants and his de&s;ires, but it opens to him a wide field for plea&s;ure. He finds delights un|known to the re&s;t of the animated cre|ation from their varied combinations. The fables of the ancients pretend, that mu&s;ic was fir&s;t found out by the beating of different hammers upon the &s;mith's anvil. Without pur&s;uing the fable, let us endeavour to explain the nature of mu&s;ical &s;ounds by a &s;imilar method; for fable may often conduct us to truth. Let us &s;uppo&s;e an anvil, or &s;everal &s;imilar anvils, to be &s;truck upon by &s;everal hammers of different weights or forces. The hammer, which
<PB N="149" REF="158">
is double that of another, upon &s;triking the anvil will produce a &s;ound double that of the other: this double &s;ound mu&s;icians have agreed to call an Oc|tave. The ear can judge of the differ|ence or re&s;emblance of the&s;e &s;ounds with great ea&s;e, the numbers being as one and two, and therefore very readily compared. Suppo&s;e that an hammer three times le&s;s than the fir&s;t, &s;trikes the anvil, the &s;ound produced by this will be three times le&s;s than the fir&s;t: &s;o that the ear, in judging the &s;imilitude of the&s;e &s;ounds, will find &s;omewhat more difficulty; becau&s;e it is not &s;o ea&s;y to tell how often one is contained in three, as it is to tell how often it is contained in two. Again, &s;uppo&s;e that an ham|mer four times le&s;s than the fir&s;t &s;trikes the anvil, the ear will find greater dif|ficulty &s;till in judging preci&s;ely the dif|ference of the &s;ounds; for the difference of the numbers four and one cannot &s;o &s;oon be determined with preci&s;ion as three and one. If the hammer be five
<PB N="150" REF="159">
times le&s;s, the difficulty of judging will be &s;till greater. If the hammer be &s;ix times le&s;s, the difficulty &s;till increa&s;es, and &s;o al&s;o of the &s;eventh, in&s;omuch that the ear cannot always readily and at once determine the preci&s;e gradation. Now, of all compari&s;ons, tho&s;e which the mind makes mo&s;t ea&s;ily, and with lea&s;t labour, are the mo&s;t plea&s;ing. There is a certain regularity in the human &s;oul, by which it finds happine&s;s in exact and &s;triking and ea&s;ily-made compari&s;ons. As the ear is but an in&s;trument of the mind, it is therefore mo&s;t plea&s;ed with the combination of any two &s;ounds, the differences of which it can mo&s;t readily di&s;tingui&s;h. It is more plea&s;ed with the concord of two &s;ounds, which are to each other as one and two, than of two &s;ounds, which are as one and three, or one and four, or one and five, or one and &s;ix or &s;even. Upon this plea&s;ure, which the mind takes in compari&s;on, all harmony depends. The variety of &s;ounds are in|finite; but becau&s;e the ear cannot com|pare
<PB N="151" REF="160">
two &s;ounds &s;o as readily to di&s;tin|gui&s;h their di&s;criminations when they exceed the proportion of one and &s;e|ven, mu&s;icians have been content to confine all harmony within that com|pa&s;s, and allowed but &s;even notes in mu&s;ical compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>LET us now then &s;uppo&s;e a &s;tringed in&s;trument fitted up in the order men|tioned above. For in&s;tance: let the fir&s;t &s;tring be twice as long as the &s;econd; let the third &s;tring be three times &s;horter than the fir&s;t, let the fourth be four times, the fifth &s;tring five times, and the &s;ixth &s;ix times as &s;hort as the fir&s;t. Such an in&s;trument would probably give us a repre&s;entation of the lyre as it came fir&s;t from the hand of the inventor. This in&s;trument will give us all the &s;e|ven notes following each other, in the order in which any two of them will accord together mo&s;t plea&s;ingly; but yet it will be a very inconvenient and a very di&s;agreeable in&s;trument: inconvenient,
<PB N="152" REF="161">
for in a compa&s;s of &s;even &s;trings only the fir&s;t mu&s;t be &s;even times as long as the la&s;t; and di&s;agreeable, becau&s;e this fir&s;t &s;tring will be &s;even times as loud al&s;o: &s;o that when the tones are to be played in a different order, loud and &s;oft &s;ounds would be intermixed with mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting alternations. In order to improve the fir&s;t in&s;trument, there|fore, &s;ucceeding mu&s;icians very judici|ou&s;ly threw in all the other &s;trings be|tween the two fir&s;t, or, in other words, between the two octaves, giving to each, however, the &s;ame proportion to what it would have had in the fir&s;t natural in&s;trument. This made the in&s;trument more portable, and the &s;ounds more even and plea&s;ing. They therefore di&s;|po&s;ed the &s;ounds between the octave in their natural order, and gave each its own proportional dimen&s;ions. It is not my de&s;ign here to enter farther into this &s;ubject than merely its &s;lighte&s;t elements; let it therefore &s;uffice to &s;ay that, in ge|neral, of the&s;e &s;ounds, where the pro|portion
<PB N="153" REF="162">
between any two of them is mo&s;t obvious, the concord between them will be mo&s;t plea&s;ing. Thus octaves, which are as two to one, have a mo&s;t harmonious effect; the fourth and fifth al&s;o &s;ound &s;weetly together, and they will be found, upon calculation, to bear the &s;ame pro|portion to each other that octaves do.
<Q REND="margQuotes">"Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, (&s;ays Mr. Sa|veur) that the mu&s;ical &s;cale is merely an arbitrary combination of &s;ounds: it is made up from the con&s;onance and differences of the parts which compo&s;e it. Tho&s;e who have often heard a fourth and a fifth accord to|gether, will be naturally led to di&s;cover their difference at once; and the mind unites it&s;elf to their beauties."</Q>
Let us then cea&s;e to a&s;&s;ign the coincidences of vibrations as the cau&s;e of harmony, &s;ince the&s;e coincidences in two &s;trings vibrating at different intervals, mu&s;t at be&s;t be but fortuitous, whereas concord is always plea&s;ing. The true cau&s;e why concord is plea&s;ing, mu&s;t ari&s;e from our
<PB N="154" REF="163">
power, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, of mea&s;uring more ea&s;ily the differences of the tones. In proportion as the note can be mea&s;ured with its fundamental tone by large and obvious di&s;tinctions, then the concord is mo&s;t plea&s;ing; on the contrary, when the ear mea&s;ures the di&s;criminations of two tones by very &s;mall parts, or can|not mea&s;ure them at all, it lo&s;es the beauty of their re&s;emblance: the whole is di&s;|cord and pain.</P>
<P>BUT there is another property in the vibration of a mu&s;ical &s;tring not yet taken notice of, and which &s;erves to confirm the foregoing theory. If we &s;trike the &s;tring of an harp&s;ichord, or any other ela&s;tic &s;ounding cord what|ever, it returns a continuing &s;ound. This till of late was con&s;idered as one &s;imple uniform tone; but all mu&s;icians now confe&s;s, that in&s;tead of one tone it actu|ally returns four tones, and that con|&s;tantly. The notes are, be&s;ide the fun|damental tone, an octave above, a twelfth
<PB N="155" REF="164">
above, and a &s;eventeenth. One of the ba&s;e notes of an harp&s;ichord has been di&s;&s;ected in this manner by Mr. Rameau, and the actual exi&s;tence of the&s;e tones proved beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of being controverted. In fact, the experiment is ea&s;ily tried; for if we &s;martly &s;trike one of the lower keys of an harp&s;ichord, and then take the finger bri&s;kly away, a tolerable ear will be able to di&s;tingui&s;h, that after the fundamental tone has cea&s;ed, three other &s;hriller tones will be di&s;tinctly heard: fir&s;t the octave above, then the twelfth, and la&s;tly the &s;eventeenth: the octave above is in general almo&s;t mixed with the fundamental tone, &s;o as not to be ea&s;ily perceived, except by an ear long habituated to the minute di&s;crimi|nations of &s;ounds. So that we may ob|&s;erve, that the &s;malle&s;t tone is heard la&s;t, and the deepe&s;t or large&s;t tone fir&s;t: the two others in order.</P>
<P>IN the whole theory of &s;ounds, nothing has given greater room for &s;peculation,
<PB N="156" REF="165">
conjecture, and di&s;appointment, than this amazing property in ela&s;tic &s;trings. The whole &s;tring is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged to be in vibration in all its parts, yet this &s;ingle vibration returns no le&s;s than four different &s;ounds. They who account for the tones of &s;trings by the number of their vibrations are here at the greate&s;t lo&s;s. Daniel Bernouilli &s;up|po&s;es, that a vibrating &s;tring divides it|&s;elf into a number of curves, each of which has a peculiar vibration, and though they all &s;wing together in the common vibration, yet each vibrates within it&s;elf. This opinion, which was &s;upported, as mo&s;t geometrical &s;pecu|lations are, with the parade of demon|&s;tration, was only born &s;oon after to die. Others have a&s;cribed this to an ela&s;tic diffe|rence in the parts of the air, each of which, at different intervals, thus received dif|ferent impre&s;&s;ions from the &s;tring, in proportion to their ela&s;ticity. This is ab&s;urd. If we allow the difference of tone to proceed from the force, and not
<PB N="157" REF="166">
the frequency of the vibrations, this dif|ficulty will admit of an ea&s;y &s;olution. The&s;e &s;ounds, though they &s;eem to exi&s;t together in the &s;tring, actually follow each other in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: while the vi|bration has greate&s;t force, the funda|mental tone is brought forward: the force of the vibration decaying, the oc|tave is produced, but almo&s;t only in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly; to this &s;ucceeds, with di|mini&s;hed force, the twelfth, and la&s;tly the &s;eventeenth is heard to vibrate with great di&s;tinctne&s;s, while the three other tones are always &s;ilent. The&s;e &s;ounds, thus excited, are all of them the har|monic tones, who&s;e differences from the fundamental tone are, as we &s;aid, &s;trong and di&s;tinct. On the other hand, the di&s;cordant tones cannot be heard, their differences being but very &s;mall are overpowered, and in a manner drowned in the tones of &s;uperior difference: yet not always neither; for Daniel Bernou|illi has been able, from the &s;ame &s;troke, to make the &s;ame &s;tring bring out its har|monic
<PB N="158" REF="167">
and its di&s;cordant tones al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Memoires de l'Acad&eacute;mie de Berlin, 1753, p. 153.</NOTE>. So that from hence we may ju&s;tly infer, that every note what&s;oever is only a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of tones, and that tho&s;e are mo&s;t di&s;tinctly heard, who&s;e differences are mo&s;t ea&s;ily perceivable. Thus far then we &s;ee a &s;trong &s;imilitude between a tone of &s;ound and a ray of light: both are, to all appearance, &s;imple and uniform; but art can di&s;&s;ect them, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;cover their con&s;tituent prin|ciples.</P>
<P>I WOULD only ob&s;erve here far|ther, that of all the &s;ounds I have hi|therto experienced, tho&s;e brought from the edge of the mu&s;ical gla&s;s are mo&s;t &s;imple and uniform. The great plea|&s;ure they give is from their &s;implicity alone; for when three, or any other number of them, come to be united to|gether into one harmony, the &s;ounds are low, trifling, confu&s;ed, and &s;carce &s;upe|rior
<PB N="159" REF="168">
to that of a jews-harp. So that we &s;ee how injudiciou&s;ly the performers on gla&s;&s;es manage, who play fir&s;ts, &s;econds, and &s;ometimes a ba&s;e altogether upon an in&s;trument, who&s;e only excellence de|pends, not on its &s;trength, but its &s;im|plicity of tone.</P>
<P>TO recapitulate all that has been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of &s;ounds: long con|tinued tones are nothing more than a repetition of the &s;ame &s;troke and tone. By &s;wiftly repeating the &s;trokes, all bo|dies are capable of giving tones; but the&s;e tones do not ari&s;e from the &s;wift|ne&s;s but the greatne&s;s of the blow. The tone, therefore, in ela&s;tic &s;trings, is not to be attributed to the frequency of the vibration, but to its force, to that greater vehemence with which a long and thick &s;tring, permitted by proper ten&s;ion to exert its whole ela&s;tic power, excels a &s;hort and &s;mall &s;tring &s;crewed up almo&s;t beyond its pitch of ela&s;ticity. The quan|tity of vibration is always proportioned
<PB N="160" REF="169">
to the length, diameter, and dimini&s;hed ten&s;ion of the &s;tring; but the quantity or depth of tone is not always &s;o. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this, in practically tuning mo&s;t mu&s;ical in&s;truments, as the tone and vibrations ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and are u&s;ually &s;imilar, the vibrations will &s;erve to mea&s;ure the tone. But then, when we con&s;ider the &s;ubject philo|&s;ophically, we &s;hould not call tho&s;e vi|brations the parent, when they are only the &s;i&s;ter of mu&s;ical &s;ounds. Light and flame are ever &s;een together, and yet it would be unju&s;t to &s;ay that light is the parent of flame. True thinking is no|thing more than giving effects their pro|per cau&s;es.</P>
<P>I CANNOT quit a &s;ubject relative to an art, of which I am &s;o fond, without making a few &s;light remarks upon Eng|li&s;h mu&s;ical compo&s;ition in general. Fo|reigners greatly object to our harmo|nies: they accu&s;e them of being almo&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="170">
always overcharged, and that there is never room enough left for occa&s;ional force of expre&s;&s;ion. Whether their di&s;|like to Handel be ju&s;t or not, I will not pretend to determine; but certain it is, they &s;eem highly di&s;plea&s;ed with his &s;tile and manner, nor will they bear to hear him named with Ha&s;&s;e, Pergole&s;e, Faradellas, or any of the principal fo|reign compo&s;ers. The fire of his mu&s;ic, as they expre&s;s it, is much too great, and generally unfitted to the &s;ubject and the performers. They &s;hould have con|&s;idered, however, that it is in general adapted to the audience: the Engli&s;h have been ever remarked for being fond of loud mu&s;ic. Scaliger, as early as the time of Queen Elizabeth, gives that peculiarity among the features of their national character. Handel &s;eems to have &s;tudied his audience perfectly: he knew that an Engli&s;h ear found le&s;s plea&s;ure in the &s;ound of a violin, than in the glorious notes of a drum.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="171">IT has been objected by foreigners, that modern Engli&s;h mu&s;ic labours throughout under the ab&s;urdity of mi&s;|taken expre&s;&s;ion.

<P>IT has been objected by foreigners to modern Engli&s;h mu&s;ic, that the concert pitch has been injudiciou&s;ly altered. There is, &s;ay they, a certain &s;tretch, at which all &s;trings give their fine&s;t tones: that, in general, is the pitch which the other nations of Europe have found by

In the colder climates, this pitch, if it be altered at all, &s;hould be let down; for &s;ounds &s;trike bri&s;ker in a cold air than in a warm, in fro&s;t, for in&s;tance, than in the &s;ultry heats of autumn.

<P>TO all the&s;e objections I can only an|&s;wer, that, whatever be our defects in this way, modern Italian mu&s;ic, (for the French need not be mentioned, as &s;ome will &s;carce allow that they have any) modern Italian mu&s;ic, I &s;ay, is &s;till more defective than ours. Whatever variety of expre&s;&s;ion ours may want from too much harmony, theirs actually wants from a deficiency of genius. I have heard a judicious friend ob&s;erve, that he thought all the modern Italian canta|ta's but a repetition of the &s;ame tune. In fact, though they at pre&s;ent aim &s;o much at &s;implicity, contrary to what is
<PB N="164" REF="173">
u&s;ually imagined upon this &s;ubject, I have heard a &s;inger throw more &s;ong into his voluntary clo&s;e, than the com|po&s;er had given him in his part. But in proportion as the compo&s;ers are &s;teril, their performers are compelled to be wild, and to make up in tawdry orna|ment what the piece wants in &s;olidity. Mu&s;ic, notwith&s;tanding, mu&s;t be owned to have been indebted for many improve|ments to &s;ome later compo&s;ers. Alberti is graceful, Tartini delicate, Rameau, though a Frenchman, often &s;ublime: Handel's mu&s;ic is well adapted; but, after all, Correlli is &s;till inimitable.</P>
<P>THEY who would de&s;ire a thorough knowledge of the mathematical princi|ples, upon which the &s;cience of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition is founded, cannot have a better or more accurate guide than Smith's Treati&s;e of Harmonies.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Sound in general.</HEAD>
<P>IF we were to examine all nature for a place proper for augmenting and echoing &s;ounds with mo&s;t force, and with greate&s;t exactne&s;s, we &s;hould find the human ear to be be&s;t formed for the&s;e purpo&s;es. By its admirable con|trivance it repeats &s;ounds of all kinds, admits the greate&s;t quantity into the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, and echoes each back without confu&s;ion. Within the &s;kull there is a large bony canal, that has one end opening into the ear, and the other running backwards with &s;everal turnings, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the internal wind|ings of a common &s;nail-&s;hell. This la|byrinth is lined within by a very fine &s;kin, which is but an expan&s;ion of the nerves that &s;erve for hearing, and which, uniting together towards the bottom,
<PB N="167" REF="176">
carry the &s;ounds directly to the brain. But before the &s;ound can come to the labyrinth, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;trike again&s;t a thin &s;kin, which is &s;tretched, like the parchment of a drum, acro&s;s a pa&s;&s;age that leads from the outward ear into the mouth. This membrane or &s;kin is called the drum of the ear, and, as in a common drum, there is a contrivance that &s;eems calculated to brace or relax it at plea&s;ure. About the u&s;e of this drum modern phy&s;iologi&s;ts are divided. The common opinion is, that all &s;ounds mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;trike again&s;t this, and make its parts vibrate like a beaten drum, and that this vibration is communicated to the internal labyrinth, who&s;e tremors corre&s;pond, and thus the &s;ound is car|ried to the brain. They go on al&s;o to affirm, that when the drum of the ear is either too much relaxed, or totally de|&s;troyed, there can be no tremors of &s;ound conveyed to the labyrinth, and that therefore the per&s;on mu&s;t become deaf. This doctrine, however, is contradicted
<PB N="168" REF="177">
by others, who affirm, that per&s;ons hear perfectly well who have been totally de|prived of this ear-drum; that others drive tobacco &s;moak, which they take in at their mouths, through both ears, and as in its pa&s;&s;age it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;trained through the drum of the ear, (for there is no other way by which it can pa&s;s) they are apt to think that this membrane, which admits &s;o gro&s;s a fluid, cannot be the proper in&s;trument for hearing. Be&s;ides all this, they affirm that birds, who&s;e hearing is very exqui|&s;ite, are deprived of this apparatus, and therefore &s;o may we, and yet &s;till con|tinue to hear. The&s;e objections are &s;trong. The late&s;t and mo&s;t probable opinion therefore is, that the drum of the ear is not &s;o much de&s;igned to ren|der us capable of hearing &s;ounds, (for we can hear without it) but to make us capable of exactly di&s;tingui&s;hing them. To render us &s;en&s;ible of the difference between deep and &s;hrill tones, or, as they are otherwi&s;e called, between &s;ounds that
<PB N="169" REF="178">
are grave, and &s;uch as are acute. For the reception of a &s;hrill tone the drum is braced tightly, and therefore vibrates with the &s;wifte&s;t and &s;horte&s;t tremblings; in receiving the grave tones, it is braced more loo&s;ely, its tremblings therefore are free, wide, and open.</P>
<P>AS a confirmation of this opinion, it is obvious, that tho&s;e who have the drum of the ear any way inflamed or di&s;or|dered, can bear to hear deep or grave &s;ounds; but the &s;hrill and acute give them inexpre&s;&s;ible pain. In order to pre|pare for the &s;hrill &s;ound, the drum, as was &s;aid, mu&s;t be braced up tight, and this bracing will nece&s;&s;arily be as pain|ful as it would be to &s;tretch out a finger &s;treight that was contracted by an in|flammation. However this be, the con|trivance for the increa&s;e of &s;ound in the ear is allowed to be admirable by all. Human ingenuity can make a machine, which may imitate vi&s;ion exactly; but nothing that the art of man can form is
<PB N="170" REF="179">
found to increa&s;e &s;ounds &s;o much in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s as the human ear.</P>
<P>MOST &s;ounds, we all know, are con|veyed to us on the bo&s;om of the air. In whatever manner they either float upon it, or are propelled forward in it, certain it is, that without the vehicle of this or &s;ome other fluid, we &s;hould have no &s;ounds at all. Let the air be exhau&s;ted from a receiver, and a bell &s;hall emit no &s;ound when rung in the void; for, as the air continues to grow le&s;s den&s;e, the &s;ound dies away in proportion, &s;o that at la&s;t its &s;tronge&s;t vibrations are almo&s;t totally &s;ilent.</P>
<P>THUS air is a vehicle for &s;ound. However, we mu&s;t not with &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers a&s;&s;ert, that it is the only vehi|cle; that if there were no air, we &s;hould have no &s;ounds what&s;oever: for it is found by trial, that &s;ounds are conveyed through water almo&s;t with the &s;ame facility with which they move through air: a bell rung in water returns a tone
<PB N="171" REF="180">
as di&s;tinct as if rung in our aerial at|mo&s;phere. This was ob&s;erved by Der|ham, who al&s;o remarked, that the tone came a quarter deeper. Natural hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ure us al&s;o, that fi&s;hes have a &s;trong perception of &s;ounds, even at the bottom of deep rivers. From hence, therefore, we may, I think, rea&s;onably infer, that it is not very material in the propagation of &s;ounds, whether the fluid which conveys them be ela&s;tic or otherwi&s;e. Water, which of all &s;ub|&s;tances that we know, has the lea&s;t ela&s;|ticity, yet &s;erves to carry them forward; and if we make allowance for the dif|ference of its den&s;ity, perhaps the &s;ounds move in it with a proportional rapidity, to what they are found to do in the ela&s;tic fluid of air. It may be &s;aid, indeed, that the water conveys &s;ounds not of it&s;elf, but becau&s;e mixed with a quantity of air, which is not totally deprived of its ela&s;ticity; that the &s;ound is carried forward by the vibra|tions of this. To this way of rea&s;oning
<PB N="172" REF="181">
we an&s;wer nothing: it may &s;erve to for|tify an hypothe&s;is well enough, but it will never carry conviction with it.</P>
<P>ONE thing however is certain, that whether the fluid which conveys the note be ela&s;tic or non-ela&s;tic, whatever &s;ound we hear is produced by a &s;troke, which the &s;ounding body makes again&s;t the fluid, whether air or water. The fluid being &s;truck upon, carries the im|pre&s;&s;ion forward to the ear, and there produces its &s;en&s;ation. Philo&s;ophers are &s;o far agreed, that they all allow that &s;ound is nothing more than the impre&s;|&s;ion made by an ela&s;tic body upon the air or water, and this impre&s;&s;ion carried along by either fluid to the organ of hearing. But the manner in which this conveyance is made is &s;till di&s;puted: Whether the &s;ound is diffu&s;ed into the air, in circle beyond circle, like the waves of water, when we di&s;turb the &s;mooth|ne&s;s of its &s;urface by dropping in a &s;tone, or whether it travels along, like

rays diffu&s;ed from a center, &s;omewhat in the &s;wift manner that electricity runs along a rod of iron; the&s;e are the que|&s;tions which at pre&s;ent divide the learned, and are likely to continue to divide them.</P>
<P>NEWTON was of the fir&s;t opinion. He has explained the progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ound by an undulatory, or rather a vermicular motion in the parts of the air. If we have an exact idea of the crawling of &s;ome in&s;ects, we &s;hall have a tolerable notion of the progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ound upon this hypothe&s;is. The in|&s;ect, for in&s;tance, in its motion fir&s;t car|ries its contractions from the hinder part, in order to throw its fore part to the proper di&s;tance, then it carries its contrac|tions from the fore part to the hinder, to bring that forward. Something &s;imi|lar to this is the motion of the air when &s;truck upon by a &s;ounding body. To be a little more preci&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e ABC, (&s;ee fig. 53.) the &s;tring of an harp&s;i|chord &s;crewed to a proper pitch, and
<PB N="174" REF="184">
drawn out of the right line by the finger at B. We formerly &s;aid, that &s;uch a &s;tring would, if let go, vibrate to E, and from E to D, and back again. We ob|&s;erved, that it would continue thus to vibrate like a pendulum for ever, if not externally re&s;i&s;ted, and, like a pendu|lum, all its little vibrations would be performed in equal times, the la&s;t and the fir&s;t being equally long in perform|ing. We &s;hewed al&s;o that, like a pen|dulum, its greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s would al|ways be when it arrived at E, the middle part of its motion. Now then, if this &s;tring be &s;uppo&s;ed to fly from the finger at B, it is obvious, that whatever be its own motion, &s;uch al&s;o will be the mo|tion of the parts of air that fly before it. Its motion, as is obvious, is fir&s;t uni|formly accelerated forward from B to E, then retarded as it goes from E to D, accelerated back again as it returns from D to E, and retarded from E to B. This motion being therefore &s;ent in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion through a range of ela&s;tic air, it
<PB N="175" REF="185">
mu&s;t happen, that the parts of one range of air mu&s;t be &s;ent forward with acce|lerated motion, and then with a retard|ed motion. This accelerated motion reaching the remote&s;t end of the fir&s;t range will be communicated to a &s;e|cond range, while the neare&s;t parts of the fir&s;t range being retarded in their motion, and falling back with the re|ce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tring, retire fir&s;t with an accelerated, then with a retarded mo|tion, and the remote&s;t parts will &s;oon follow. In the mean time, while the parts of the fir&s;t range are thus falling back, the parts of the &s;econd range are going forward with an accelerated mo|tion. Thus there will be an alternate conden&s;ation and relaxation of the air, during the time of one vibration; and as the air going forward &s;trikes any op|po&s;ing body with greater force than up|on retiring, &s;o each of the&s;e accelerated progre&s;&s;ions have been called by New|ton a pul&s;e of &s;ound.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="186">THUS will the air be driven forward in the direction of the &s;tring. But now we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the&s;e pul&s;es will move every way; for all motion im|pre&s;&s;ed upon fluids in any direction what&s;oever, operates all around in a &s;phere: &s;o that &s;ounds will be driven in all directions, backwards, forwards, up|wards, downwards, and on every &s;ide. They will go on &s;ucceeding each other, one without &s;ide the other, like circles in di&s;turbed water; or rather, they will lie one without the other, in concentric &s;hells, &s;hell above &s;hell, as we &s;ee in the coats of an onion.</P>
<P>ALL who have remarked the tone of a bell, while its &s;ounds are decaying away, mu&s;t have an idea of the pul&s;es of &s;ound, which, according to Newton, are formed by the air's alternate pro|gre&s;&s;ion and rece&s;&s;ion. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as each of the&s;e pul&s;es are formed by a &s;ingle vibration of the
<PB N="177" REF="187">
&s;tring, they mu&s;t be equal to each other; for the vibrations of the &s;tring are known to be &s;o.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as to the velocity with which &s;ounds travel, this Newton determines, by the mo&s;t difficult calculation that can be imagined, to be in proportion to the thickne&s;s of the parts of the air, and the di&s;tance of the&s;e parts from each other. From hence he goes on to prove, that each little part moves backward and for|ward like a pendulum; and from thence he proceeds to demon&s;trate, that if the atmo&s;phere were of the &s;ame den&s;ity every where as at the &s;urface of the earth, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a pendulum that reached from its highe&s;t &s;urface down to the &s;ur|face of the earth, would by its vibrations di&s;cover to us the proportion of the ve|locity with which &s;ounds travel. The velocity with which each pul&s;e would move, he &s;hews, would be as much greater than the velocity of &s;uch a pen|dulum &s;winging with one complete vi|bration,
<PB N="178" REF="188">
as the circumference of a circle is greater than the diameter. From hence he calculates, that the motion of &s;ound would be nine hundred and &s;e|venty-nine feet in one &s;econd. But this not being con&s;onant to experience, he takes in another con&s;ideration, which de&s;troys entirely the rigour of his former demon&s;tration, namely, vapours in the air, and then finds the motion of &s;ound to be one thou&s;and one hundred and forty-two in one &s;econd, or near thir|teen miles in a minute: a proportion which experience had e&s;tabli&s;hed nearly before.</P>
<P>THUS much will &s;erve to give an ob|&s;cure idea of a mo&s;t ob&s;cure theory: a theory which has met with numbers of oppo&s;ers; &s;ome more forward, condemn|ing what they thought they knew, but did not really under&s;tand; others more prudent, condemning the whole doc|trine, not as fal&s;e, but becau&s;e ob&s;cure. Even John Bernouilli, Newton's greate&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="189">
di&s;ciple, mode&s;tly owns that he did not pre|tend to under&s;tand this part of Newton's Principia. He attempted therefore to give a more per&s;picuous demon&s;tration of his own, that might confirm and illu&s;trate the Newtonian theory. The &s;ubject &s;eemed to reject elucidation: his theory is obviou&s;ly wrong, as D'Alembert has proved in his Theory of Fluids. Euler, therefore, rejecting the Newtonian doc|trine entirely, has attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h another; but as he has hitherto only given the re&s;ult of his calculations, with|out the progre&s;&s;ive proofs that con|firm his opinion, the learned continue in &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to the merit of his work.</P>
<P>VARIOUS have been the objections that have been made to the Newtonian &s;y&s;tem of &s;ounds. Fir&s;t, it is urged, that if the fir&s;t pul&s;e of &s;ound be driven by that which immediately follows, and that by the &s;ucceeding, and &s;o on, it mu&s;t then happen, that the more numerous the pul&s;es, the farther will the &s;ound be
<PB N="180" REF="190">
driven; &s;o that a &s;tring which vibrates the longe&s;t will be heard at the greate&s;t di|&s;tance, which is contrary to known ex|perience. Again, it is urged, that this theory can only agree with the motion of &s;ound in an ela&s;tic fluid, whereas &s;ounds are known to move forward through water that is not ela&s;tic: to ex|plain their progre&s;s therefore through water, a &s;econd theory mu&s;t be formed: &s;o that two theories mu&s;t be made to ex|plain a &s;imilar effect, which is contrary to the &s;implicity of true philo&s;ophy, for it is contrary to the &s;implicity of nature. It is &s;till farther urged, that this &s;low vermicular motion but ill repre&s;ents the velocity with which &s;ounds travel, as we know by experience, that it is almo&s;t thirteen miles in a minute. In &s;hort, it is urged, that &s;uch undulations as have been de&s;cribed, when coming from &s;eve|ral &s;onorous bodies at once, would cro&s;s, ob&s;truct, and confound each other; &s;o that, if they were conveyed to the ear by this means, we &s;hould hear nothing but
<PB N="181" REF="191">
a medley of di&s;cord, and broken articu|lations. But this is equally with the re&s;t contradictory to experience, &s;ince we hear the fulle&s;t concert, not only without con|fu&s;ion, but with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure. The&s;e objections, whether well founded or not, have given ri&s;e to another theory. The reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf, which of the two he will prefer: <HI>non no&s;trum e&s;t tantas componere lites.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY &s;ound may be con&s;idered as driven off from the &s;ounding body in &s;traight lines, and impre&s;&s;ed upon the air in one direction only; but whatever im|pre&s;&s;ion is made upon a fluid in one di|rection, is diffu&s;ed upon its &s;urface into all directions: &s;o that the &s;ound fir&s;t driven directly forward &s;oon fills up a wide &s;phere, and is heard on every &s;ide. Thus, as it is impre&s;&s;ed, it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly tra|vels forward with a very &s;wift motion, re&s;embling the velocity with which we know electricity flies from one end of a line to another.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="192">NOW, as to the pul&s;es, or open &s;hakes as the mu&s;icians expre&s;s it, which a &s;ounding body is known to make, a little reflection may &s;erve to &s;hew, that each pul&s;e is it&s;elf a di&s;tinct and perfect &s;ound, and that the interval between every two pul&s;es is profoundly &s;ilent. Continuity of &s;ound from the &s;ame body is only a deception of the hearing; for as each di&s;tinct &s;ound &s;ucceeds at very &s;mall in|tervals, the organ has not time to tran&s;|mit its images with equal &s;wiftne&s;s to the mind, and the interval is thus lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e; ju&s;t as in &s;eeing a flaming torch, if flared round in a circle, it appears as a ring of fire. In this manner a beaten drum, at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, pre&s;ents us with the idea of continuing &s;ound. When children run with their &s;ticks along a rail, a continuing &s;ound is thus repre&s;ented, though it need &s;carce be ob&s;erved, that the &s;trokes again&s;t each rail is perfectly di&s;tinct and in&s;ulated.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="193">ACCORDING to this theory, therefore, the pul&s;es are nothing more than di&s;tinct &s;ounds repeated by the &s;ame body, the fir&s;t &s;troke or vibration being ever the loude&s;t, and travelling farther than tho&s;e that follow; while each &s;ucceeding vi|bration gives a new &s;ound, but with di|mini&s;hed force, till at la&s;t the pul&s;es de|cay away totally, as the force decays that gives them exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ALL bodies what&s;oever that are &s;truck, return more or le&s;s a &s;ound; but &s;ome wanting ela&s;ticity, give back a repetition of the &s;ound: the noi&s;e is at once be|gotten and dies; while other bodies, how|ever, there are, which being more ela&s;tic, and who&s;e parts are capable of vibration, give back a &s;ound, and repeat the &s;ame &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The&s;e la&s;t are &s;aid to have a tone; the others are not allowed to have any.</P>
<P>THIS tone of the ela&s;tic &s;tring or bell is notwith&s;tanding nothing more than a
<PB N="184" REF="194">
&s;imilar &s;ound to what the former bodies produced, but with the difference of be|ing many times repeated, while their note is but &s;ingle. So that, if we would give the former bodies a tone, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make them repeat their &s;ound, by repeating our blows &s;wiftly upon them. This will effectually give them a tone, and even an unmu&s;ical in|&s;trument has often had a fine effect by its tone in our concerts.</P>
<P>LET us now go on then to &s;uppo&s;e, that by &s;wift and equably continued &s;trokes we give any non-ela&s;tic body its tone, it is very obvious, that no altera|tions will be made in this tone by the quickne&s;s of the &s;trokes, though repeated never &s;o fa&s;t. The&s;e will only render the tone more equal and continuous, but make no alteration in the tone it gives. On the contrary, if we make an alteration in the force of each blow, a different tone will then undoubtedly be excited. The difference will be &s;mall, I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
<PB N="185" REF="195">
for the tones of the&s;e inflexible bodies are capable but of &s;mall variation; how|ever, there will certainly be a difference. The table on which I write, for in&s;tance, will return a different &s;ound when I &s;trike it with a club, from what it did when I only &s;truck it with a &s;witch. Thus non-ela&s;tic bodies return a difference of tone, not in proportion to the &s;wiftne&s;s with which their &s;ound is repeated, but in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the blow which produced it; for in two equal non-ela&s;tic bodies, that body pro|duced the deepe&s;t tone that was &s;truck by the greate&s;t blow.</P>
<P>WE now then come to a critical que&s;tion, What is it that produces the difference of tone in two ela&s;tic &s;ounding bells or &s;trings? Or what makes one deep and the other &s;hrill? This que&s;tion has al|ways been hitherto an&s;wered by &s;aying, that the depth or heighth of the note proceeded from the &s;lowne&s;s and &s;wift|ne&s;s of the times of the vibrations. The
<PB N="186" REF="196">
&s;lowe&s;t vibrations, it has been &s;aid, are qualified for producing the deepe&s;t tones, while the &s;wifte&s;t vibrations produce the highe&s;t tones. In this ca&s;e an effect has been given for a cau&s;e. It is in fact the force with which the &s;ounding &s;tring &s;trikes the air when &s;truck upon, that makes the true di&s;tinction in the tones of &s;ounds. It is this force, with greater or le&s;s impre&s;&s;ions, re&s;embling the greater or le&s;s force of the blows upon a non-ela&s;tic body, which produces corre&s;pon|dent affections of &s;ound. The greate&s;t forces produce the deepe&s;t &s;ounds: the high notes are the effect of &s;mall efforts. In the &s;ame manner a bell, wide at the mouth, gives a grave &s;ound; but if it be very ma&s;&s;y withal, that will render it &s;till graver; but if ma&s;&s;y, wide, and long or high, that will make the tone deepe&s;t of all.</P>
<P>THUS then will ela&s;tic bodies give the deepe&s;t &s;ound, in proportion to the force with which they &s;trike the air; but if
<PB N="187" REF="197">
we &s;hould attempt to increa&s;e their force by giving them a &s;tronger blow, this will be in vain: they will &s;till return the &s;ame tone; for &s;uch is their formation, that they are &s;onorous only, becau&s;e they are ela&s;tic, and the force of this ela&s;ticity is not increa&s;ed by our &s;trength, as the greatne&s;s of a pendulum's vibration will not be increa&s;ed by falling from a greater height.</P>
<P>THUS far of the lengths of cords; now as to the frequency with which they vi|brate the deepe&s;t tones, it has been found, from the nature of ela&s;tic &s;trings, that the longe&s;t &s;trings have the wide&s;t vibra|tions, and con&s;equently go backward and forward &s;lowe&s;t; while, on the contrary, the &s;horte&s;t &s;trings vibrate the quicke&s;t, or come and go in the &s;horte&s;t intervals. From hence tho&s;e who have treated of &s;ounds have a&s;&s;erted, as was &s;aid before, that the tone of the &s;tring depended up|on the length or the &s;hortne&s;s of the vi|brations. This, however, is not the ca&s;e.
<PB N="188" REF="198">
One and the &s;ame &s;tring, when &s;truck, mu&s;t always, like the &s;ame pendulum, return preci&s;ely &s;imilar vibrations; but it is well known, that one and the &s;ame &s;tring, when &s;truck upon, does not al|ways return preci&s;ely the &s;ame tone: &s;o that in this ca&s;e the vibrations follow one rule, and the tone another. The vibra|tions mu&s;t be invariably the &s;ame in the &s;ame &s;tring, which does not return the &s;ame tone invariably, as is well known to mu|&s;icians in general. In the violin, for in|&s;tance, they can ea&s;ily alter the tone of the &s;tring an octave or eight notes higher, by a &s;ofter method of drawing the bow; and &s;ome are known thus to bring out the mo&s;t charming airs imaginable. The&s;e peculiar tones are by the Engli&s;h fiddlers called Flute Notes, if I mi&s;take hot. The only rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;ign|ed for the &s;ame &s;tring thus returning dif|ferent tones, mu&s;t certainly be the dif|ferent force of its &s;trokes upon the air. In one ca&s;e, it has double the tone of the other, becau&s;e upon the &s;oft touches
<PB N="189" REF="199">
of the bow, only half its ela&s;ticity is put into vibration.</P>
<P>THIS being under&s;tood, we &s;hall be able clearly to account for many things relating to &s;ounds that have hitherto been inexplicable. Thus, for in&s;tance, if it be a&s;ked, When two &s;trings are &s;tretched together of equal lengths, ten&s;ion, and thickne&s;s, how does it happen, that one of them being &s;truck, and made to vi|brate throughout, the other &s;hall vibrate throughout al&s;o? The an&s;wer is obvious: the force that the &s;tring &s;truck receives is communicated to the air, and the air communicates the &s;ame to the &s;imilar &s;tring, which therefore receives all the force of the former, and the force be|ing equal, the vibrations mu&s;t be &s;o too. Again put the que&s;tion, If one &s;tring be but half the length of the other, and be &s;truck, how will the vibrations be? The an&s;wer is, the longe&s;t &s;tring will receive all the force of the &s;tring half as long as it&s;elf, and therefore it will vibrate in
<PB N="190" REF="200">
proportion, that is, through half its length. In the &s;ame manner, if the longe&s;t &s;tring were three times as long as the other, it would only vibrate in a third of its length: or if four times, in a fourth of its length. In &s;hort, whatever force the &s;maller &s;tring impre&s;&s;es upon the air, the air will impre&s;s a &s;imilar force upon the longer &s;tring, and partially excite its vibrations.</P>
<P>FROM hence al&s;o we may account for the cau&s;e of tho&s;e charming, melancholy gradations of &s;ound in the Eolian lyre, a modern in&s;trument, invented by Mr. O&s;wald. The Eolian lyre is ea&s;ily made, being nothing more than a long narrow box of thin deal, about a yard long, and four inches wide, with an hole on one &s;ide. On this &s;ide are &s;even &s;trings of very fine gut, &s;tretched over bridges at each end, like the bridge of a &s;iddle, and &s;crewed up or relaxed with &s;crew pins. The &s;trings are all tuned to one and the &s;ame note, and the in&s;trument is placed
<PB N="191" REF="201">
in &s;ome current of air, where the wind can bru&s;h over its &s;trings with free|dom. A window with the &s;a&s;h ju&s;t rai&s;ed, to give the air admi&s;&s;ion, will an|&s;wer this purpo&s;e exactly. Now when the entering air blows upon the&s;e &s;trings with different degrees of force, there will be excited different tones of &s;ound; &s;ometimes the bla&s;t brings out all the tones in full concert; &s;ometimes it &s;inks them to the &s;ofte&s;t murmurs; it feels for every tone, and by its gradations of &s;trength &s;olicits tho&s;e gradations of &s;ound, which art has taken different methods to produce.</P>
<P>We come now, in the la&s;t place, to con&s;ider the loudne&s;s and the lowne&s;s, or as mu&s;icians &s;peak, the &s;trength and &s;oftne&s;s of &s;ounds. In vibrating ela&s;tic &s;trings, the loudne&s;s of the tone is in proportion to the deepne&s;s of the note; that is, in two &s;trings, all things in other circum&s;tances alike, the deepe&s;t tone will be loude&s;t. In mu&s;ical in&s;truments,
<PB N="192" REF="202">
upon a different principle, as in the violin, it is otherwi&s;e; the tones are made in &s;uch in&s;truments, by a number of &s;mall vibrations crowded into one &s;troke. The refined bow, for in&s;tance, being drawn along a &s;tring, its roughne&s;&s;es catch the &s;tring at very &s;mall intervals, and excite its vibrations. In this in&s;trument, there|fore, to excite loud tones, the bow mu&s;t be drawn quick, and this will produce the greate&s;t number of vibrations. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the more quick the bow pa&s;&s;es over the &s;tring, the le&s;s apt will the roughne&s;s of its &s;urface be to touch the &s;tring at every in&s;tant; to remedy this, therefore, the bow mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed the harder as it is drawn quicker, and thus its fulle&s;t &s;ound will be brought from the in&s;trument. If the &s;wiftne&s;s of the vibrations in an in&s;trument thus rubbed upon, exceed the force of the deeper &s;ound in another, then the &s;wift vibrations will be heard at a greater di&s;tance, and as much farther off, as the
<PB N="193" REF="203">
&s;wiftne&s;s in them exceeds the force in the other.</P>
<P>BUT one thing more remains. It may be objected to this theory, that if the tone of a &s;tring was cau&s;ed by the force of its &s;troke, then tho&s;e parts of the air that were neare&s;t the &s;ounding body would be impre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t force, and would therefore give the greate&s;t of deepe&s;t tone; while, as the &s;ound went off to a greater di&s;tance, and the force became con&s;equently le&s;s, the tone would become le&s;s al&s;o; or, in other words, grow higher and higher: but this, con|tinue the objectors, is known, by expe|rience, to be otherwi&s;e. To this it might be an&s;wered, that the force once im|pre&s;&s;ed continues ever the &s;ame. But, in fact, I am apt to allow their objec|tion, but to deny their conclu&s;ion. I am inclined to believe that the tone actually alters as it travels onward, becoming higher, as it recedes from the &s;ounding body. I would offer the following rea|&s;ons
<PB N="194" REF="204">
for this opinion, rather as motives to excite farther &s;earch, than as deci&s;ions to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity. In hearing di&s;tant &s;ounds, it is probable, we labour under the &s;ame continual deceptions which we do in &s;eeing di&s;tant objects; the judg|ment in both is ever correcting the er|roneous repre&s;entation of the &s;en&s;es. A man, when &s;een at a mile's di&s;tance, ap|pears actually but a few inches tall, yet the per&s;on who &s;ees him, would be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, if told, that what he &s;aw was an object no bigger than his finger. It may be the &s;ame with &s;ounds; the tone may dimini&s;h by di&s;tance, and yet we may not be &s;en&s;ible of it without a nice compari&s;on. It may be added, that as vi&s;ual objects, when placed at a di&s;tance, fade from the &s;ight, and a&s;&s;ume the colour of the air as they remove; &s;o &s;ounds, to u&s;e the painter's word, may have their <HI>keeping</HI> in like manner, and thus by becoming indi&s;tinct and low.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="205">THAT we labour under a deception with regard to tones, and that they be|come higher as they come from a greater di&s;tance, may be inferred from mu&s;ical compo&s;ition. The greate&s;t ma&s;ters in this art, when they would imitate a di&s;|tant echo, generally take the &s;ounds an octave higher. A few years ago, a fel|low exhibited in We&s;tmin&s;ter, the art of imitating &s;ounds at any di&s;tance what|ever. I remarked, that whenever he de&s;igned to imitate a voice coming from a great di&s;tance, he not only made the &s;ound more low and indi&s;tinct, but rai&s;ed the tone &s;everal pitches higher than that u&s;ed in his nearer imitations. A few ob&s;ervations &s;ince made upon &s;ounds, induce me to believe, that they become higher as they come from a di&s;tance more remote; while, on the contrary, that they deepen, the more the vibrations approach the labyrinth of the ear. The following ea&s;y and common experiment I think will prove it. Take any thing whatever, capable of giving a
<PB N="196" REF="206">
&s;ound; let it be a common poker, for in&s;tance; and tying on a garter at top, &s;o as that both ends of the garter are left at liberty; the&s;e ends mu&s;t be rolled round the fir&s;t finger of each hand, and then with the&s;e fingers &s;topping the ears clo&s;e, &s;trike the poker, thus &s;u&s;pended, again&s;t any body what&s;oever. The depth of the tone which this new mu&s;ical in&s;trument returns will be amazing. The deepe&s;t and large&s;t bell will not equal it. Whence is this, unle&s;s from the clo&s;e approach of the &s;ounding body, who&s;e vibrations are immediately communicated to the internal parts of the ear. I am &s;en|&s;ible that many objections may be made to this la&s;t opinion; &s;ucceeding expe|rience mu&s;t, however, determine whe|ther it be ju&s;t or not: but &s;uch as make them mu&s;t be particularly careful, not to let their former experience correct their immediate &s;en&s;ations. This alter|ation of tone, with di&s;tance, however, mu&s;t dimini&s;h but by great intervals. The fir&s;t part of this theory appears to
<PB N="197" REF="207">
me very probable, whatever befalls the latter part of it. Some of the outlines are taken from &s;ome hints dropped by Mr. Buffon.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it may be with regard to the theories of &s;ound, experience has taught us, that it travels at about the rate of 1142 feet in a &s;econd, or near thirteen miles in a minute. The method of calculating its progre&s;s is ea&s;ily made known. When a gun is di&s;charged at a di&s;tance, we &s;ee the fire long before we hear the &s;ound. If then we know the di&s;tance of the place, and know the time of the interval between our fir&s;t &s;eeing the fire and then hearing the report, this will &s;hew us exactly the time the &s;ound has been travelling to us. For in&s;tance, if the gun is di&s;|charged a mile off, the moment the fla&s;h is &s;een, I take a watch and count the &s;econds till I hear the &s;ound; the number of &s;econds is the time the &s;ound has been travelling a mile.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="208">DERHAM has gone yet farther, and proved by experience, that all &s;ounds whatever travel at the &s;ame rate. The &s;ound of a gun, and the &s;triking of a hammer, are equally &s;wift in their mo|tions; the &s;ofte&s;t whi&s;per flies as &s;wiftly, as far as it goes, as the loude&s;t thunder.</P>
<P>AS &s;ound is communicated from a &s;ingle point, in every direction, it mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, dimini&s;h in &s;trength the farther it goes. All bodies &s;ent out directly in rays from a center, meet greater re&s;i&s;tances, as the &s;quares of their di&s;tances become greater; and therefore the progre&s;s of &s;ounds will be re&s;i&s;ted in proportion, as their di&s;|tances, by being &s;quared, increa&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS, however, mu&s;t not be con&s;i|dered as a con&s;tant rule; for when a &s;ound travels again&s;t the wind, it takes a longer time than when it flies before it. Of con&s;equence it goes fa&s;ter one way than the other, and thus, as it is no
<PB N="199" REF="209">
longer diffu&s;ed in a &s;phere, the law of its progre&s;s forward mu&s;t al&s;o be altered. Ulloa thinks that the &s;ame &s;ound which, again&s;t a &s;trong wind, travels nine miles and a half, would, if it went with the wind in the &s;ame time, travel ten miles and a half, that is a whole mile farther.</P>
<P>TO drive the human voice to the greate&s;t di&s;tance, we are obliged to make u&s;e of art. The in&s;trument called the &s;peak|ing trumpet is well known at land; but it is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary at &s;ea. The voice reflected from the &s;ides of this tube, which is made pretty much in the figure of an hunt&s;man's &s;traight horn, is encrea&s;ed at its mouth, and thus, as it is &s;aid, &s;trikes the air with greater force. There are very different opinions, both with re&s;pect to the manner in which the &s;peaking trumpet increa&s;es &s;ound, and al&s;o with regard to the be&s;t figure of &s;uch an in&s;trument; the logarithmic curve has been adopted by &s;ome, and the para|bolic curve by others; it is for geometri|cians
<PB N="200" REF="210">
to di&s;pute; arti&s;ts u&s;ually chu&s;e a figure peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A &s;ubject not le&s;s di&s;puted than the former, and &s;till le&s;s under&s;tood, is the cau&s;e and nature of an echo. It is &s;aid, in general terms, that an echo is a reflection of &s;ound, &s;triking again&s;t &s;ome object, as an image is reflected in a gla&s;s. If this, however, were the ca&s;e, all bodies with a &s;mooth &s;urface would be capable of reflecting &s;ounds, which we know, by experience, they are not. That the &s;ound is reflected none can de|ny, the great difficulty lies in deter|mining what are the proper qualities in a body for thus reflecting &s;ounds. Were this preci&s;ely known, we &s;hould then be able to make an echo at plea&s;ure; but &s;ome have found, to their co&s;t, that &s;uch art attempt is impracticable; what|ever arts they have tried to bring the coy nymph to their gardens or plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, have proved ineffectual; a poet would &s;ay, that &s;he flies the palaces
<PB N="201" REF="211">
of the great, content with &s;olitude and privacy.</P>
<P>IT is in general known, that caverns, grottoes, mountains, and ruined build|ings return this image of &s;ound. Image we may call it, for in every re&s;pect it re&s;embles the image of a vi&s;ible object reflected from a poli&s;hed &s;urface. Our figures are often repre&s;ented in a mirrour, without &s;eeing them our&s;elves, while tho&s;e &s;tanding on one &s;ide are alone &s;en&s;ible of the reflection. To be capable of &s;ee|ing the reflected image of our&s;elves, we mu&s;t be directly in a line with the image. Ju&s;t &s;o is it in an echo; we mu&s;t &s;tand in the line in which the &s;ound is re|flected, or the repetition will be lo&s;t to us, while it may, at the &s;ame time, be di&s;tinctly heard by others who &s;tand at a &s;mall di&s;tance to one &s;ide of us. I remem|ber a very extraordinary echo, at a ruined fortre&s;s near Louvain, in Flanders. If a per&s;on &s;ung, he only heard his own voice, without any repetition, on the
<PB N="202" REF="212">
contrary, tho&s;e who &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;|&s;tance, heard the echo but not the voice; but then they heard it with &s;urpri&s;ing variations, &s;ometimes louder, &s;ometimes &s;ofter, now more near, then more di&s;|tant. There is an account in the me|moirs of the French academy, of a &s;imi|lar echo near Rouen. The building which returns it is a &s;emicircular court|yard; yet all buildings of the &s;ame form do not produce the &s;ame effects. We find &s;ome mu&s;ic halls excellently adapt|ed for &s;ounds, while others, built upon the &s;ame plan, in a different place, are found to mix the tones, in&s;tead of en|larging them, in a very di&s;agreeable manner.</P>
<P>AS we know the di&s;tance of places by the length of time a &s;ound takes to travel from them, &s;o we may judge of the di&s;tance of an echo, by the length of the interval between our voice and its repetition. The mo&s;t deliberate echoes,
<PB N="203" REF="213">
as they are called, are ever the mo&s;t di&s;tant; while on the contrary, tho&s;e that are very near, return their &s;ounds &s;o very quick as to have the interval almo&s;t imperceptible; when this is the ca&s;e, and the echo is &s;o very near, the voice is &s;aid to be increa&s;ed and not echoed; however, in fact, the increa&s;e is only made by the &s;wiftly pur&s;uing repetition. Our the|atres and concert rooms are be&s;t fitted for mu&s;ic or &s;peaking, when they en|large the &s;ound to the greate&s;t pitch, at the &s;malle&s;t interval: for a repetition which does not begin the word till the &s;peaker has fini&s;hed it, throws all the &s;ounds into confu&s;ion. Thus the theatre at the Hay|market, enlarges the &s;ound very much; but then, at along interval, after the &s;inger or &s;peaker. The theatre at Drury-lane, before it was altered, enlarged the &s;ound but in a &s;mall degree; but then the re|petition was extremely quick in its pur|&s;uit; and the &s;ounds, when heard, were therefore heard di&s;tinctly. Dergoli&s;e, the
<PB N="204" REF="214">
great mu&s;ical compo&s;er, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that an echo was the be&s;t &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s; for let a man's own mu&s;ic be never &s;o good, by playing to an echo &s;he would teach him to improve it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of &s;ome anomalous Properties of the Air, which have not been yet accounted for.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e properties of the air, there are &s;everal others the cau&s;es of which are more ob&s;cure, or to &s;peak more ingenuou&s;ly, the cau&s;es of which we are not able to a&s;&s;ign with &s;o &s;trong an appearance of truth. Boyle has given us a chapter expre&s;sly upon this &s;ubject; where like a true philo&s;opher he confe&s;&s;es the limits of his own powers, and where he cannot find the true cau&s;es, refu&s;es to give conjectural ones. The vital principle of the air is one of its properties which cannot be account|ed for, and which foil human &s;agacity: that principle which it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in feeding flame, is al&s;o equally in&s;cru|table; it is driven off by heat, yet &s;till
<PB N="206" REF="216">
more &s;trange, heat cannot be continued without it.</P>
<P>The power it has of whitening &s;ome bodies and tanning others, is a property we may admire, but cannot account for. We are at a lo&s;s al&s;o to account for the aptitude of the air, in keeping hetero|geneous bodies &s;upported on its bo&s;om, while the heavier fluids of the &s;ame region and the &s;ame place are quite free from tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. Thus it is often found, that the air of &s;ome countries is extremely unhealthful and noxious, while the waters of the &s;ame place are admired for their &s;alubrity. We have a &s;hort memoir of one of the members of the Academy of Sciences in Paris to this purpo&s;e; "A ma&s;on working by the &s;ide of a deep well near the city of Rennes, happening to let his hammer fall, one of the labourers who attended him, went down, but was &s;uffocated be|fore he reached the bottom: the &s;ame thing befel a &s;econd, who went down to draw
<PB N="207" REF="217">
up the body; a third al&s;o underwent the &s;ame fate: a fourth, almo&s;t drunk, was let down, but with po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances to be drawn up the moment he gave the &s;ignal; this he quickly gave, but was drawn up &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and died in three days after. The mo&s;t extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance of the relation is, that the water of this well had long been u&s;ed by the neighbourhood without any noxious ef|fects what&s;oever.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of the air's in&s;crutable qua|lities is, that if kept for &s;ome time inclo&s;ed in a ve&s;&s;el without any commu|nication with the external atmo&s;phere, it becomes deadly and pe&s;tilential in the highe&s;t degree; all animals that are obliged to re&s;pire in it in&s;tantly die. We have another account of the pe&s;tilential effects of clo&s;e air, related in the &s;ame work: "A baker of Chartres had a cellar under his hou&s;e, to which there was a de&s;cent by a &s;tairca&s;e of thirty-&s;ix &s;teps. Thither his &s;on, a &s;trong young
<PB N="208" REF="218">
man, went to carry down a &s;ack of bran, but while he was on the &s;teps the candle was extingui&s;hed. Unconcerned at this, which he regarded as an accident, he went back, lighted his candle, and again returned; but as &s;oon as he came to the lowe&s;t &s;tep he cried out, that he was unable&mdash;death interrupted the excla|mation. His brother, a youth as re|markable for &s;trength as the former, in&s;tantly ran down to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;oon cried out that he was dying, and his cries cea&s;ed a few moments after. His wife went to his re&s;cue, a &s;ervant maid followed her, they were all &s;uffo|cated. This accident terrified the whole village, and the inhabitants fled from the hou&s;e with precipitation. At length one more re&s;olute than the re&s;t, being per&s;uaded that they were not yet dead, went down to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, but he was &s;oon a &s;harer in their fate. Not daunted at this, the next day a friend of the baker's was let down into the cellar by a cord; upon his crying out they at|tempted
<PB N="209" REF="219">
to draw him up again, but the cord breaking, he fell into the cellar and was &s;uffocated in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>THE blood ve&s;&s;els of the brain upon di&s;&s;ection appeared di&s;tended, and the bowels inflamed. Upon throwing in a large quantity of water into the cellar the&s;e noxious effects were di&s;per&s;ed, and a candle having been let down was drawn up without being put out, a cer|tain indication of the melioration of the air.</P>
<P>ANOTHER property of the air, which has not yet been accounted for, is, that globular figure its parts a&s;&s;ume, when the air, by means of the pump, or by fire, is forced out of the &s;ub&s;tances into which it has in&s;inuated. The bubbles in this ca&s;e are always round; and though the bubble happens to &s;well to a thou&s;and times its former dimen&s;ions, yet its glo|bular figure &s;till remains. Can the parts of air of which the&s;e globules are
<PB N="210" REF="220">
compo&s;ed be round them&s;elves? Or will any number of globes by being in con|tact one with the other, compo&s;e a figure that is round?</P>
<P>BUT of all the in&s;crutable properties of the air, that by which it conveys &s;ounds from one place to another, is at pre&s;ent e&s;teemed the mo&s;t ob&s;cure: in the la&s;t age, when a philo&s;opher would blu&s;h if he could not be thought to a&s;&s;ign a ready cau&s;e for every effect in nature, we then had theories of the progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ound through an ela&s;tic fluid, and &s;uch were generally embraced by the learned. The&s;e theories, it mu&s;t be owned, though they added nothing to a &s;cholar's former fund of learning, yet &s;erved to conceal the bounds of what he knew; for an ob&s;cure an&s;wer will always &s;atisfy the demands of inqui&s;itive ig|norance, and create its e&s;teem: however, the doctrine of &s;ounds is now acknow|ledged the mo&s;t ob&s;cure part of na|tural philo&s;ophy. The rea&s;on may be

ea&s;ily a&s;&s;igned. Newton attempted it without &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;ucceeding philo|&s;ophers have not had talents equal to the elucidation of what he left ob&s;cure. The two minims, Le Sueur and Jac|quier, who commented upon his <HI>Prin|cipia,</HI> have proved the Newtonian hy|pothe&s;is, relating to the motion of the particles of an ela&s;tic medium, to be fal|lacious, and have propo&s;ed other methods for re&s;toring the Newtonian doctrine of &s;ound; but neither have their explana|tions carried univer&s;al conviction; a pre&s;umptive proof of their weakne&s;s or ob&s;curity.</P>

<P>THESE are the properties of Fire as enumerated by a modern wit; and nothing can be at once more full and more conci&s;e. All things contain Fire, &s;ays
<PB N="214" REF="223">
he, in &s;ome degree; it produces, it renews, divides, con&s;umes, or nouri&s;hes every part of Nature: every per&s;on's expe|rience mu&s;t inform him of the obvious properties of Fire; and in fact, philo&s;o|phers more readily prove its exi&s;tence, than give its definition.</P>
<P>WHAT is Fire? This is a que&s;tion which has divided the greate&s;t men, as well among the ancients as moderns: of the lat|ter, Boerhaave, Homberg, and Lemery, &s;uppo&s;e fire to be a body actually exi&s;ting, like air, water, or any other fluid, and diffu&s;ed through all nature. It is to be found, &s;ay they, in all places and in all things, only wanting to be collected into a narrow compa&s;s, in order to be|come manife&s;t to the &s;en&s;es. They &s;ay, that, upon uniting with other bodies, it not only increa&s;es their bulk, but their weight al&s;o. That it &s;ometimes is col|lected in &s;uch a manner, that &s;ome of its properties only appear, as when it &s;hines without burning: at other times diffe|rent
<PB N="215" REF="224">
properties are collected, and it burns without &s;hining, as in metals heated to a certain pitch.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e chymical philo&s;ophers are oppo&s;ed no le&s;s names than Bacon, Boyle, and Newton: the&s;e deny that fire is by any means it&s;elf a body, but only ari&s;es from the attrition or rubbing of bodies one again&s;t the other. Char|coal ignited, &s;ay they, what is it but wood made red and burning? A bar of iron hi&s;&s;ing from the forge, what is it but iron &s;till? In &s;hort, &s;ay they, wherever a violent attrition or inte&s;tine motion of the parts can be excited between bodies, fire will be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult; &s;uch bodies will &s;ometimes ca&s;t forth flame, and flame is it&s;elf nothing more than parts exce&s;&s;ively &s;mall, put violently into motion.</P>
<P>MODERN philo&s;ophers in general in|cline to the opinion of Boerhaave, and concur with the ancients in affirming,
<PB N="216" REF="225">
that fire is an element of a peculiar kind and an in&s;crutable nature, with properties peculiar to it&s;elf, every where appearing, but no where certainly known. Let us leave therefore the nature of this element to tho&s;e who love di&s;putation, and give the mo&s;t obvious properties of fire, but without attempting in the lea&s;t to inve&s;|tigate their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t con&s;tant property of fire is its heat: heat is ever found to increa&s;e the bulk of all bodies before it begins to con&s;ume them. When heat is applied to any &s;ub&s;tance, to iron for in&s;tance, in a moderate degree it &s;wells; the &s;ame heat increa&s;ed &s;till, increa&s;es all its dimen|&s;ions. As long as the heat or fire is continued, the dilatation increa&s;es, and the more ardent the one becomes, the more bulky &s;till will be the other. The dilatation, however, of the &s;ub&s;tance has its bounds, nor can it be infinitely increa&s;ed. When the fire is fir&s;t applied, the dilatation begins &s;lowly; it then accelerates till it
<PB N="217" REF="226">
comes to a certain pitch, then it goes on &s;lowly again; but at la&s;t, though the fire be never &s;o ardent, or continued never &s;o long, the dilatation is at a &s;tand. If we would de&s;ire to know ex|actly in what proportion bodies of dif|ferent hardne&s;s or different weights dilate; this neither theory nor expe|rience can re&s;olve. Some very hard bodies dilate more than others le&s;s hard; but then &s;ome bodies harder &s;till, dilate le&s;s than either. Tin dilates &s;ooner than the &s;ofter body, lead; iron, harder than tin, dilates le&s;s than either of them.</P>
<P>OF all fluids which are dilated by heat, air is the mo&s;t ea&s;ily expanded: next to that the chymical aether, then &s;pirit of wine, then the oil called petro|leum, then oil of turpentine, rape oil, di&s;tilled vinegar, fre&s;h water, &s;alt water, &s;pirit of vitriol, &s;pirit of nitre, and quick|&s;ilver.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="227">IN order to mea&s;ure this expan&s;ion of bodies, as well by fire as by a more moderate heat, two in&s;truments have been contrived; namely, the pyrometer, and the thermometer: the pyrometer &s;erves to &s;hew the degrees of heat in &s;olid bodies, the thermometer in fluids; the pyrometer is u&s;ually nothing more than a rod of metal equally heated and &s;o fixed, that as the heat increa&s;es, its minute&s;t dilatations may be di&s;covered by a nice adju&s;ted &s;cale. Several methods of making them have been propo&s;ed; all the methods are equally good, as the in&s;trument at be&s;t can an&s;wer but few purpo&s;es of either &s;peculation or utility.</P>
<P>THE thermometer is an in&s;trument much more known, and infinitely more u&s;eful; it very preci&s;ely mea&s;ures the degree of heat in all fluids, and con|&s;equently informs us of the temperature of the air. This in&s;trument &s;hews ex|actly when the weather is hot and when
<PB N="219" REF="228">
it is cold, which, whatever we may boa&s;t of our natural &s;en&s;ations, they but very imperfectly di&s;cover. A man, for in|&s;tance, going into a warm apartment of a bagnio, finds the air of the room exce&s;|&s;ively warm; but after being for &s;ome time in the bath, which is &s;till hotter, if he then comes out into the &s;ame apart|ment, though the air &s;till continues the &s;ame, he &s;hall think it exce&s;&s;ively cold. The travellers who go up the Andes, which are the highe&s;t, mountains in the world, often meet other travellers com|ing down, who have been in the province of Quito, which lies near its top. Their &s;en&s;ations are very different, as Ulloa informs us. The de&s;cending traveller, who has left the cold country above, is almo&s;t &s;tifled with heat; the traveller, who a&s;cends from the torrid regions below, freezes with cold; the one throws off his garment, and the other &s;eizes it with ha&s;te to keep him&s;elf warm. As our na|tural feelings are thus incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the real warmth of the
<PB N="220" REF="229">
air, or any other &s;ub&s;tances, the thermo|meter is called in, which an&s;wers the end with much greater preci&s;ion. This in|&s;trument is nothing more than, a fluid inclo&s;ed in a gla&s;s tube nicely marked, and as the fluid &s;wells with heat, it fills more of the tube, and con&s;equently ri&s;es higher; on the contrary, as it contracts with cold, it &s;inks in the tube; and thus ri&s;ing or falling, mea&s;ures the true tem|perature of the weather, or the degree of heat in any fluid into which it is immer&s;ed. The thermometer was fir&s;t di&s;covered by one Drebbel, a common Dutch pea&s;ant, who u&s;ed it merely to direct him in his occupations of hu&s;|bandry. Philo&s;ophers &s;oon found the u&s;e of &s;uch an in&s;trument, improved and converted it to purpo&s;es far beyond what the inventor had any idea of. The thermometer now u&s;ed mo&s;t fre|quently, is that of Fahrenheit's improve|ment. The fluid with which the bulb at the bottom is filled, is mercury; upon the &s;ide of the tube are marked the divi&s;ions at
<PB N="221" REF="230">
which the fluid expands by different degrees of heat from freezing, which he calls the freezing point, up to the greate&s;t heats fluid &s;ub&s;tances are ca|pable of receiving. Thus when we &s;ay, human heat is ninety-eight degrees by Fahrenheit's thermometer, it means only this, that the heat of a man's body is ninety-eight of tho&s;e degrees warmer than water when it begins to freeze. On the other hand, when we are told, that in Greenland the mercury &s;ome|times &s;tands &s;even degrees lower than 0 by Fahrenheit's thermometer, it only im|plies that the air is &s;even degrees colder than water when it begins to freeze. Several other kinds of thermometers have been made u&s;e of by different na|turali&s;ts; the difference in any of them is not very material, it is only proper that they, &s;hould hold to &s;ome one &s;tan|dard, otherwi&s;e when a philo&s;opher tells us, that the air is at &s;uch a time thirty degrees of his thermometer, we can have no idea of its peculiar heat,
<PB N="222" REF="231">
unle&s;s we have a draught of his peculiar in&s;trument al&s;o. Newton's thermometer mea&s;ured the degrees of heat with oil in&s;tead of mercury; perhaps &s;uch an in|&s;trument is more ju&s;t, but it is by no means &s;o portable as the former.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS having thus agreed upon in&s;truments that can preci&s;ely mea|&s;ure the degrees of heat and cold, can under&s;tand each other, when they talk of the different dilatations in bodies, with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT heat does not only increa&s;e the bulk of bodies, but increa&s;es their weight al&s;o. A body weighed nicely before it is put into the fire, and then weighed again, will be found to be increa&s;ed in weight very &s;en&s;ibly. It is remarkable enough, that lead when melted and red|duced by heat to a red powder, receives a con&s;iderable addition to its weight from the operation of the fire, even after it is become cold again: a pound of lead
<PB N="223" REF="232">
by being thus reduced by heat, &s;hall weigh &s;everal grains heavier than before.</P>
<P>IT is not however the property of fire always to heat or expand tho&s;e bodies in which it re&s;ides, for we frequently &s;ee it emitting light while it is perfectly cold. Pho&s;phorus, which &s;hines in the dark, rotten wood, &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h, or fle&s;h as it begins to putrefy, and &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances, all emit a light &s;en&s;ibly. So that light and heat may be con&s;idered as two &s;ocial qualities which are propagated from the &s;ame &s;ource, namely, from fire; but though u&s;ually together, yet by &s;ome unknown means are often found di&s;united.</P>
<P>HOT water cools &s;ooner by being placed under the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air pump, while on the contrary iron cools &s;ooner in the open air. Shining rotten wood lo&s;es all its light in the void, and never recovers it again; on the other hand, the glow-worm lo&s;es
<PB N="224" REF="233">
its light, but &s;oon recovers it again in the open air. If &s;everal bodies of dif|ferent heats are all placed in the &s;ame clo&s;e apartment, after a &s;hort time the heat will be equally diffu&s;ed among them, and the thermometer will &s;hew the degrees to be the &s;ame in all. Bodies heat by being expo&s;ed to the air, but never if their moi&s;ture be dried away. Hay when moi&s;t will take fire of it&s;elf, when dried it remains &s;ecure.</P>
<P>WOOD rubbed very &s;wift with a cir|cular motion takes fire. Several liquors poured one upon the other, though cold before, immediately take fire; &s;uch as any acid, a &s;pirit of vitriol for in&s;tance, when mixed with any e&s;&s;ential oil, as oil of cloves. A flint &s;truck again&s;t a &s;teel emits &s;parks of fire, the &s;ulphur contained in the flint heating and melting the metal of the iron, and mixing with it and falling in &s;mall drops, which may be gathered upon paper, and attracted by the load&s;tone. But a property &s;till more
<PB N="225" REF="234">
extraordinary than any hitherto men|tioned is, that the&s;e &s;parks &s;hall &s;et fire to gunpowder, and the flame of a candle will not. In &s;everal mines in different parts of England, they are obliged to have very different kinds of light to carry on their work by. The flame of a candle in &s;ome mines would &s;et their whole works on fire: they are therefore obliged to have a wheel with flints &s;et round the circumference like the cogs of a mill wheel; the&s;e flints continually &s;triking a &s;teel properly di&s;po&s;ed give a light, which &s;erves to guide the opera|tions of the workmen. Yet though &s;uch a machine be requi&s;ite in &s;ome places, a &s;ingle &s;park &s;truck between flint and &s;teel would in&s;tantly fire other mines where they work by the light of flame, and be more fatal than the explo&s;ion of tons of gunpowder: the&s;e are all proper|ties of this element, for which we can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on that impre&s;&s;es the &s;malle&s;t conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="235">THERE &s;eem to be two &s;ources of fire by which all nature is refre&s;hed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and even animated; for philo&s;ophers now begin to allow, that animals may be produced from no other parent than heat alone. There are probably, I &s;ay, two &s;ources of fire, the central, or that heat which is contained deep in the bowels of the earth, and the &s;olar, or &s;un's heat. In digging mines or wells it is ob&s;erved, that at a &s;mall di&s;tance below the &s;urface of the earth, the air feels a little chill; &s;omewhat deeper it is colder, and when the workmen have come preci&s;ely to that depth, beyond which the rays of the &s;un cannot pene|trate, water is found to freeze: when they de&s;cend &s;till more deep to about fifty feet below the &s;urface, they then begin to perceive the place a little warmer and ice melts. The deeper they de&s;cend from this point, the more does the heat increa&s;e, until at length their breathing becomes difficult and their candles go out.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="236">BY this central heat many have ex|plained earthquakes, the production of gems, minerals, and even the nutrition of vegetables. They who are mo&s;t wed|ded to the &s;y&s;tem, regard this heat as a central &s;un, enlivening and refre&s;hing nature beneath the &s;urface of the earth, as the planetary &s;un does the external parts of the &s;y&s;tem. Boyle, however, a&s;cribes the increa&s;e of heat at the lowe&s;t depths to vapours, which mixing with others of a different and oppo&s;ite nature, produce heat and &s;ometimes flame, as we &s;ee &s;ulphur when kneaded into a pa&s;te with filings of iron frequently does.</P>
<P>THE &s;un, as we all experience, is the cau&s;e of heat, at the &s;urface of the earth: whatever regions are &s;truck by its rays mo&s;t perpendicularly, feel the influ|ence of its heat with greate&s;t violence. For every object, placed directly beneath the rays, receive them in greate&s;t quan|tity; and be&s;ides, every object that re|ceives the perpendicular ray, will al&s;o
<PB N="228" REF="237">
receive the reflected rays, which will not be the ca&s;e, if they fall obliquely; a material con&s;ideration, though not u&s;ually taken notice of. This heat of the &s;un, which is &s;o great at the &s;urface of the earth, is much dimini&s;hed as we a&s;cend above it; &s;o that the tops of mountains are generally extremely cold; and though &s;ome of them are internally fraught with fire, yet externally they are covered with &s;now. The mountain of Hecla, in Iceland, &s;ometimes ca&s;ts forth flames and earth melted like gla&s;s into a flaming torrent; this runs down its &s;ides in rivers, while the collected &s;now drives before the current, and the whole makes the mo&s;t hideous cataract in nature. The cau&s;e of mountains being thus more cold than the valley be|low, is obvious; the valley reflects all the rays of the &s;un, warms the air, and drives the rays back directly again&s;t the ob&s;erver: the mountain reflects its rays in a &s;maller quantity; the air is thin, and will not admit of much warmth, and
<PB N="229" REF="238">
the ob&s;erver is more out of the line of each reflected ray.</P>
<P>OF all bodies which reflect or throw back the rays of the &s;un, tho&s;e which are &s;mooth, well poli&s;hed, and but little porous, do it mo&s;t powerfully; while, on the contrary, &s;oft, &s;pongy, porous bodies, reflect back but a few rays in compari&s;on, but, in a manner, &s;uck them up and keep them within them&s;elves. A look|ing gla&s;s will throw back the rays that fall upon it very powerfully, with light and warmth, while a pillow &s;hall &s;carce reflect any rays what&s;oever. Of all &s;ub|&s;tances however, poli&s;hed &s;teel reflects the rays mo&s;t, while, on the contrary, wool has the &s;malle&s;t power of reflec|tion, tran&s;mitting the rays, and &s;uf|fering them to pa&s;s through its &s;ub&s;tance in the greate&s;t number. And for this rea&s;on, wool that thus imbibes the rays in &s;uch great quantities mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be warmer than any other &s;ub&s;tance; though Reaumur, in hatching chickens
<PB N="230" REF="239">
by the means of an oven alone, made u&s;e of an artificial hen made of wool to clutch the young brood when it came from the &s;hell.</P>
<P>ALL bodies thus feel the influence of the &s;un's rays, in proportion as they &s;trike again&s;t them more directly, or as the bodies are fitted for their reception. The rays, however, as they ever continue to ope|rate, are, at the &s;ame time, re&s;trained from burning too fiercely, by the na|ture and di&s;po&s;ition of the bodies upon which they fall; the heat is diffu&s;ed evenly through their parts; and never in the natural &s;tate of things, is it found to &s;et the body in flames. To give the rays greater power they mu&s;t be col|lected by art; and when their heat thus becomes united, they con&s;ume, or, at lea&s;t, change all bodies what&s;oever with inexpre&s;&s;ible force. The harde&s;t metals, &s;teel it&s;elf melts, in a few mi|nutes, into gla&s;s, and &s;eems, by the violence of the heat, to lo&s;e its nature;
<PB N="231" REF="240">
in a few minutes more, the metal begins to &s;end up fumes, and, at la&s;t, is totally evaporated away, to mix with the air in which we breathe.</P>
<P>TO give an idea of the manner in which the &s;un's rays are thus collected together, take &s;ix or eight &s;mall look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, and holding them oppo|&s;ite to the &s;un, let their reflected light fall all upon one &s;pot, upon the crown of a hat for in&s;tance; if we put our hand there, we &s;hall find the place much warmer than the &s;un would have heated it without the reflection. If we make the united reflections fall upon the ball, at the bottom of the thermometer, (&s;ee fig. 54) we &s;hall then be perfectly con|vinced of the increa&s;ed heat by the ri&s;ing of the fluid in the tube. This experi|ment is ea&s;ily tried, and the effects will always an&s;wer. Now, if in&s;tead of eight gla&s;&s;es we &s;hould u&s;e a much greater number, the heat will be aug|mented in proportion, in the body
<PB N="232" REF="241">
upon which their united reflection falls. We have often &s;aid, that all circles may be con&s;idered as compo&s;ed of a number of right lines; and &s;pherical figures may be con&s;idered as compo&s;ed of a number of plain &s;urfaces. In&s;tead, therefore, of a number of plain gla&s;&s;es, if we &s;hould make u&s;e of one concave mirrour, (&s;ee fig. 55) &s;omewhat re&s;embling, in &s;hape, the internal &s;urface of a pewter ba&s;on, this will throw the rays upon one point, and the body, which is placed exactly there, will be con&s;umed in a time pro|portioned to the mirrour's &s;ize and con|&s;truction. I am &s;en&s;ible that mentioning &s;o vulgar an uten&s;il as a ba&s;on, may in|cur ridicule; however, a very tolerable burning reflector may be made from one of the&s;e, newly taken out of the &s;hop. For if a copper ba&s;on or di&s;h formed of a true &s;pherical figure, as &s;ome of them are, be well tinned on the in&s;ide. If then quick&s;ilver be put into this ve&s;&s;el, and rolled about its &s;ides, it will unite with the tin, and &s;tick to its &s;urface
<PB REF="242">

<PB N="233" REF="243">
as water would, and &s;ilver the whole &s;urface over with as fine a poli&s;h as it a&s;&s;umes behind a plate of looking-gla&s;s, for that is only quick&s;ilver and tin mixed together, as in this experiment. The ba&s;on thus poli&s;hed on the in&s;ide will make a very good burning mirrour, and will con&s;ume the den&s;e&s;t bodies, if laid in the proper point where the re|flected rays unite together. Such a re|flector is only for tho&s;e who will not be at the expence of &s;uch as are more powerful. The be&s;t are thought to be tho&s;e made of poli&s;hed &s;teel, as this metal is harde&s;t and be&s;t reflects the rays. Others recommend a compo&s;ition of tin and antimony; in &s;hort, each philo&s;opher chu&s;es the materials of his mirrour; and tho&s;e, in general, are found to an&s;wer be&s;t, where the &s;ub|&s;tance of which they are made is com|pact, bears an high poli&s;h, and is of a white colour; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that &s;uch as are made of black materials, as of black marble, do not reflect the
<PB N="234" REF="244">
rays at all, or, at lea&s;t, but very fee|bly; for black is a quality which ra|ther imbibes than reflects the rays that fall upon its &s;urface. We have &s;everal accounts of the force with which concave mirrours, properly formed, de|&s;troy all &s;ub&s;tances put into the focus of their energy, for &s;o is the point called, where all the reflected rays unite and burn fierce&s;t. The mirrour of Septala burnt at fifteen feet di&s;tance: Boerhaave &s;ays much of that made by T&s;chirn|hau&s;en. That of Villet's con&s;truction is equally admired; it was near four feet in diameter, and burnt &s;ub&s;tances at a di&s;tance of three feet two inches with extreme violence. Iron ore placed in its eye or focus, melted in twenty-four &s;econds, bone was turned to gla&s;s in thirty-three &s;econds, a copper halfpenny had an hole melted through it in thirty &s;econds, and &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances were con&s;umed with equal rapidity. Boerhaave informs us, that with his mir|rour he has frequently turned gold to
<PB N="235" REF="245">
gla&s;s, but could never dimini&s;h its weight; others, however, a&s;&s;ert the contrary, af|firming that part of the gold is driven away, and a part remains behind, re|duced, in a manner, to a&s;hes, or, as the chymi&s;ts call it, to a <HI>calx</HI> or <HI>caput mortuum.</HI> Such are the effects of mirrours of this con&s;truction; though it may be ob&s;erved, however, that whatever metals are thus turned to gla&s;s or to a&s;hes by the effects of heat, may be re&s;tored to their natural &s;tate by being united with charcoal, and &s;o melted over again.</P>
<P>BUT whatever we are told of the ef|fects of Villet's burning mirrour, they fall far &s;hort of what has been perform|ed by a mirrour more lately made by Mr. Buffon; for this burns at a di&s;|tance of no le&s;s than two hundred feet. This excellent naturali&s;t ju&s;tly con&s;ider|ed, that if a plain looking-gla&s;s warmed at a great di&s;tance, a number of plain gla&s;&s;es, united to fall their rays upon the &s;ame &s;pot, would actually burn; he therefore put

<P>POLISHED &s;ub&s;tances reflect the rays in greate&s;t abundance; but no &s;ub&s;tance what&s;oever is wholly de&s;titute of this reflecting power.

<P>BUT the concave figure is not the only one by which the rays of the &s;un are thus collected together; for any tran&s;parent convex body that permits the rays to pa&s;s through it, will unite them in a focal point &s;omewhere behind it. One of the gla&s;&s;es of a common pair of &s;pectacles, if it be &s;ufficiently con|vex (that is gradually ri&s;ing in the mid|dle) will burn wood, or any other &s;ub|&s;tance that lies at the proper di&s;tance under its eye. We &s;hall &s;hew the man|ner how a convex gla&s;s thus directs the rays that pa&s;s through it in a point be|hind, in another place (&s;ee fig. 56). Let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve here, that if &s;o &s;mall a gla&s;s as that ju&s;t mentioned has power to burn, what will not the power be of that made by T&s;chirnhau&s;en, which was near four feet broad, an inch and an half thick, and who&s;e focal point,
<PB N="239" REF="249">
or that point where all the rays were mo&s;t collected, was twelve feet from the gla&s;s, &s;o that it burnt with its greate&s;t force at that great di&s;tance. Stones, me|tals, earths, fled in&s;tantly away before it; it was ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that its ardour was mo&s;t efficacious, when the &s;ub&s;tance to be con&s;umed was laid upon a piece of charcoal. Yet we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e the effects of &s;uch a gla&s;s equal to tho&s;e of the concave mirrour mentioned before. From its figure it cannot unite the rays into &s;o &s;mall a point as the former, and there|fore mu&s;t operate with le&s;s influence. Burning in&s;truments of this kind are u&s;ually made with gla&s;s; but any tran&s;|parent &s;ub&s;tance that lets the rays pa&s;s freely through, will an&s;wer the end as well. An hollow gla&s;s of the proper &s;hape filled with water, has all the &s;ame effect as &s;olid gla&s;s would have. And this was known to the ancients, for Lac|tantius a&s;&s;ures us, that a globe filled with water, would kindle a fire even in the mid&s;t of winter, which he thought &s;till

the more &s;urpri&s;ing. A burning in|&s;trument may be thus made of horn, if very tran&s;parent, of I&s;ingla&s;s, of glue, of ice it&s;elf. In fact, ice makes an ex|cellent burning in&s;trument. Take a piece of ice, put it into a common bra&s;s ladle, and by melting, it will &s;hape it&s;elf, in the bottom of the ladle, to the figure you propo&s;e, that is convex on one &s;ide and plain on the other. U&s;e this as a burning gla&s;s, and it will an&s;wer rather better; particularly if the water has been boiled before it froze, &s;o as to purge it of all its air.</P>
<P>THE effects of burning in&s;truments, whether concave or convex, are great, always in winter, which is very extra|ordinary, &s;ince the heat which they collect is &s;o much le&s;s at that &s;ea&s;on. However, there may be a very good rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this &s;eeming para|dox. Vapours are found greatly to di|mini&s;h the efficacy of the rays collected by the ardent in&s;trument; charcoal burn|ing
<PB N="241" REF="251">
and &s;ending up its vapour under the converging rays, enfeebles them &s;urpri|&s;ingly. There are always le&s;s vapours in winter than in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>A burning mirrour not only collects the rays of heat, but of light al&s;o; &s;ome|times giving luminary rays &s;uch a bril|liancy as to dazzle, and, at la&s;t, de&s;troy the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ight. Thus the light of the moon may be collected in the eye of a burning mirrour, with a &s;plendour only inferiour to the united beams of the &s;un; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e beams are &s;o very bright, they have no heat at all. Nor is want of heat in the moon beams to be wondered at; for by calculation it has been found, that the heat of this luminary is three million of times le&s;s than that of the &s;un; but our be&s;t in&s;truments can make the beams either of the &s;un or moon, only three hundred times more powerful than they were before. So that the moon beams, even after they have been united to|gether,
<PB N="242" REF="252">
are &s;till a thou&s;and times colder than the common heat of the &s;un in the ordinary &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>DUFAY, a French philo&s;opher, fir&s;t tried the force of the&s;e in&s;truments, in collecting the rays of a common culi|nary fire. Neither the concave mirrour, nor the convex gla&s;s, would collect the rays of a charcoal fire, when &s;ingle and alone; but by uniting their forces, he found that they had a moderate &s;hare of force. He fir&s;t took a large gla&s;s con|vex upon both &s;ides, &s;o that the rays of the fire pa&s;&s;ing through it went out be|hind parallel to each other. The&s;e rays thus tran&s;mitted were received upon the &s;urface of a concave mirrour behind, which reflected them into a focus; however, they could burn only when the two in&s;truments were but four feet a&s;under. So very much are the rays of a culinary fire enfeebled by pa&s;&s;ing through the pores of gla&s;s, while the &s;olar rays, on the contrary, &s;eem to lo&s;e
<PB N="243" REF="253">
very little of their force. The heat of a common fire is thus compo&s;ed of gro&s;s and ma&s;&s;y parts, while that of the &s;un is penetrating, light, and active. Is it to be wondered therefore, that the juices which are nouri&s;hed in the vegetable world by the &s;olar heat, are light, pun|gent, and racy, while tho&s;e which cu|linary heat produces in an hot-hou&s;e, are more vapid and le&s;s highly flavoured?</P>
<P>IF a concave burning mirrour be placed before a large fire, it gives back the heat in a con&s;iderable degree, &s;o as to be &s;en&s;ibly felt at thirty or forty paces di&s;tance. But it will not, however, be reflected into a focal point. An in|&s;trument of this kind might be u&s;eful in kitchens, to reflect, and thus double the heat of their fires. A learned Dutch writer advi&s;es cook maids, in ge|neral, in&s;tead of the &s;pherically formed mirrours, to make u&s;e of the true para|bolic curve; for then it will reflect the rays mo&s;t exactly parallel to its axis.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Cold.</HEAD>
<P>COLD is a quality who&s;e nature, like that of fire, is be&s;t known by its effects. Whatever are the properties of fire, tho&s;e of cold &s;eem to be directly oppo&s;ite. Fire increa&s;es the bulk of all bodies, cold contracts them; fire tends to di&s;&s;ipate their &s;ub&s;tance, cold con|den&s;es them, and &s;trengthens their mu|tual cohe&s;ion. But though cold thus &s;eems, by &s;ome of its effects, to be no|thing more than the ab&s;ence and pri|vation of heat, as darkne&s;s is only the privation of light; yet cold is &s;eemingly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of another property, that has induced many to think it a di&s;tinct &s;ub|&s;tance from heat, and of a peculiar nature. It is univer&s;ally known, that when cold, by being continued, contracts and con|den&s;es
<PB N="245" REF="255">
&s;ub&s;tances to a certain degree; if then its power be increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of continuing to contract and le&s;&s;en their bulk, it enlarges and expands them; &s;o that extreme cold, like heat, &s;wells the &s;ub&s;tance into which it enters. Thus, in fluids, they contract &s;en&s;ibly with cold till the moment they begin to freeze; from thenceforward they dilate, and take up more &s;pace than they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed while in a &s;tate of fluidity. When liquor turns to ice in a clo&s;e ca&s;k, it is often known to bur&s;t the ve&s;&s;el. When ice is broken upon a pond it &s;wims upon upon the &s;urface; a certain proof of its being of a larger bulk than &s;o much water.</P>
<P>WATER, after lo&s;ing its fire, by means of which it remains in a fluid &s;tate, be|comes more den&s;e; con&s;equently its par|ticles mutually touch in a greater num|ber of points, and therefore cohere more &s;trongly, to a degree, that water turns to a hard body, commonly called ice.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="256">IF a very cold air is in contact with the &s;urface of the water, there it fir&s;t lo&s;es its fire: and thus the cau&s;e of its fluidity being removed, the upper &s;ur|face of the water turns to a film or &s;kin of ice, formed by oblong threads or fila|ments. And this is the rea&s;on why water u&s;ually begins to freeze on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>AS water in freezing becomes more den&s;e after lo&s;ing its fire, its interme|diate &s;paces or pores become &s;maller, and being filled with air, this air comes to be compre&s;&s;ed, and thus its ela&s;ticity being heightened, it forces out of the pores of the water, a&s;cending in it, as being lighter than water, in the form of &s;mall bubbles; and having reached the upper film of ice, their e&s;cape is there prevented, and thus they run into larger bubbles, when come into mutual con|tact. And this accounts for the great number of air-bubbles ob&s;ervable in ice. If by boiling, or by the air-pump, we
<PB N="247" REF="257">
di&s;charge the air out of water, and then &s;et it to freeze, the bubbles, it is true, will be fewer, but that it &s;hall have none is not po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the air can never be all of it di&s;charged.</P>
<P>AND thus the air forming bubbles in ice, mu&s;t expand it, and cau&s;e it to oc|cupy a larger &s;pace than water, and con|&s;equently render it lighter, and make it float on the water. It &s;hould there|fore &s;eem, that the ice of the water purged of air, &s;hould be of equal weight with it. But experience &s;hews the con|trary. For &s;uch ice laid on water floats in like manner, though &s;inking much deeper in it than other ice. And it is not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, as neither by boiling, nor by the air-pump, all the air can be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>THE Florentine academicians attempt|ing to di&s;cover the extent of the expan|&s;ion of water when turned to ice, found that the &s;pace occupied by the water,
<PB N="248" REF="258">
was to that occupied by the ice to which it was froze, as 8 to 9. Again, they took a certain weight of water which they &s;et to freeze, and filling the &s;pace occupied by the ice, with water, and weighing it, they found the weight of the fir&s;t to that of the &s;econd water, as 25 to 28 1/19. Now 8 is to 9, as 25 is to 28&frac18;. So that the ratio of 8 to 9 differs but little from that of 25 to 28 1/19.</P>
<P>FROM this extraordinary expan&s;ion of water, we may readily conceive why it cracks the gla&s;&s;es in which it freezes. Huygens filled a &s;tout gun-barrel with water, &s;ecuring it at both ends, and in twelve hours after it bur&s;t with a loud explo&s;ion. The Florentines filled a copper ball with water, and filing it down gradually, it at la&s;t bur&s;t, by the water froze in it. Mu&s;chenbroek, by calculation, found, that a force of 27,720 pounds was requi&s;ite to tear this ball a&s;under. At Peter&s;burg, in the winter of
<PB N="249" REF="259">
1749, an iron bomb was bur&s;t by water turned to ice. And we have in&s;tances of the havock produced in the &s;ub&s;tance of vege|tables, trees, and even of &s;plitting rocks, when the fro&s;t is carried to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>FREEZING is carried on much more expeditiou&s;ly when the water is at re&s;t than when it is in motion; it is ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of this, as the ice is carried from one &s;urface to another by filaments, the current is &s;till de&s;troying them as &s;oon as formed; and it would be as difficult for a &s;pider's web to be formed while the wind was breaking and blowing the threads that formed it, as it is for the fro&s;t to &s;end forth its fila|ments in the proper order, for the ge|neral congelation of a river. In very great fro&s;ts however, rivers them&s;elves are frozen. I have &s;een the Rhine frozen at one of its mo&s;t precipitate cataracts, and the ice &s;tanding in gla&s;&s;y columns like a fore&s;t of large trees, the branches of which have been newly lopt away.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="260">BUT though the current of the &s;tream oppo&s;es its freezing, yet a gentle and hot wind frequently helps it forward. Fahrenheit a&s;&s;ures us, that a pond which &s;tands quite calm, often acquires a de|gree of cold much beyond what is &s;uf|ficient for freezing, yet no congelation en&s;ues. If a &s;light breath of air happens in &s;uch ca&s;e to bru&s;h over the water's &s;urface, it &s;tiffens the whole in an in|&s;tant. The water before congelation and in its liquid &s;tate, &s;inks the thermometer very low, which &s;hews its exce&s;&s;ive degree of coldne&s;s. The moment that by the air, or any other agitation, it begins to con|geal, the thermometer ri&s;es to the ordinary freezing point. The cau&s;es of all the&s;e are in&s;crutable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of philo&s;ophical experiments.</P>
<P>IN general, the ice of northern regions is much harder than that of the more &s;outhern climates; and though it con|tains more air, yet its contexture is much &s;tronger by rea&s;on of the greater degree
<PB N="251" REF="261">
of cold by which it is congealed. The ice of Spitzbergen and the Greenland &s;eas is &s;o hard, that it is very difficult to break it with a hammer. In our own climate we may, in general, form a very ju&s;t conjecture, concerning the duration of fro&s;t by the hardne&s;s of the ice. If in the beginning of the fro&s;t, the ice is harder and more re&s;i&s;ting than u&s;ual, it is a &s;ign that the fro&s;t will continue long in proportion. A machine might with a little ingenuity be made, that would di&s;cover this hardne&s;s with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion. During the hard fro&s;t of 1740, a palace of ice was built at Pe|ter&s;burg after the mo&s;t elegant model, and the ju&s;te&s;t proportions of Augu&s;tan architecture. It was fifty-two feet long, and twenty feet high: the materials were quarried from the &s;urface of the river Neva, and the whole &s;tood gli&s;|tening again&s;t the &s;un with a brilliancy almo&s;t equal to his own. To increa&s;e the wonder, &s;ix cannons of ice, two
<PB N="252" REF="262">
bombs, and mortars, all of the &s;ame ma|terials, were planted before this extraor|dinary edifice. The cannon were three pounders, they were charged with gun|powder and fired off; the ball of one of them pierced an oak plank at &s;ixty paces di&s;tance and two inches thick, nor did the piece bur&s;t with the explo&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Mairan Di&s;&s;ert &s;ur la Glace. Part. II. Sec. 3. Chap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN melting of ice, if it be laid upon &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances it melts fa&s;ter than upon others, nor can we a&s;&s;ign any cau&s;e for the difference; it melts &s;ooner in a &s;ilver plate than upon the palm of the hand, and it melts &s;ooner upon copper than on any other metal what&s;oever. Ice melts &s;ooner in water, than expo&s;ed to the air of a &s;imilar temperature. Sooner in water a little warm than near the fire when it is hotter. It melts &s;ooner in the void, than expo&s;ed to the atmo|&s;phere. If it takes twenty minutes
<PB N="253" REF="263">
to di&s;&s;olve in open air, it will be but four minutes di&s;&s;olving in the exhau&s;ted receiver.</P>
<P>THOUGH ice be a hard body, yet it is &s;ubject to a con&s;tant evaporation when the cold in the air is exce&s;&s;ive. Perrault found, that four pounds of ice, which lay expo&s;ed for 19 days in the open air, was lighter by a whole pound. M. Mairan, in the year 1716, in which, for &s;ome days, the cold was as &s;evere as that of the winter 1709, al&s;o found that ice, which had lain in the air and in a northerly wind, had lo&s;t in 24 hours above a fifth in weight: from which we may, at the &s;ame time, perceive the rea&s;on, why &s;now, lying expo&s;ed in a continued cold on the earth, becomes dimini&s;hed in quantity.</P>
<P>WE have hitherto con&s;idered cold and freezing, as effects ari&s;ing barely from the ab&s;ence of heat. There is, per|haps, &s;omething actual or real in this
<PB N="254" REF="264">
ca&s;e; po&s;&s;ibly a body, which expels the particles of fire out of other bodies, while it&s;elf forces into their pores, and thus coagulates the fluid matters; that is, con&s;trains or binds their parts, in &s;uch a manner as to cohere &s;trongly toge|ther. The diffidence which one &s;hould entertain concerning his conclu&s;ions, gives weight to this thought, and the experiments performed with &s;alts will enhance it.</P>
<P>IF a thermometer is &s;et in cold water, and you remark how far the &s;pirit &s;inks; then throwing in &s;altpetre, you will ob|&s;erve the &s;pirit to &s;ink deeper &s;till, after the &s;altpetre is di&s;&s;olved in the water. The &s;ame thing happens, if in&s;tead of &s;altpetre, you u&s;e common &s;alt, or which is better, &s;al ammoniac.</P>
<P>WATER congeals in a gla&s;s which is &s;et in &s;alted &s;now: and, if only the under part of the gla&s;s &s;tands in the &s;now, the congelation happens from be|low
<PB N="255" REF="265">
upwards, and then we may plainly perceive the manner in which the air is di&s;charged out of the water. In this ca&s;e, the gla&s;s does not readily &s;pring or fly; but if you cover it entirely with &s;alted &s;now, in order to promote a con|gelation all over, and thus prevent the di&s;charge of the air, the gla&s;s flies.</P>
<P>AS heat expands &s;olid bodies, &s;o cold contracts them. On the expul&s;ion of the heat, the parts of the body draw clo&s;er together, and thus their matter is reduced to a &s;maller compa&s;s. Now, as a body becomes cold on lo&s;ing its heat, it becomes den&s;er in the proportion of the cold; and yet not in an infinite progre&s;&s;ion, nature &s;etting bounds to both.</P>
<P>COLD and heat affect the pendulum rod of clocks, the fir&s;t contracting or &s;hortening, and the la&s;t dilating or length|ening it, and thus altering its motion; which is attempted to be remedied, by
<PB N="256" REF="266">
oppo&s;ing expan&s;ion to expan&s;ion, and contraction to contraction.</P>
<P>IRON is hardened by cold, upon making it fir&s;t glowing hot, and then quenching it in cold water or moi&s;t loam; the&s;e are bodies which quickly deprive iron of its heat; and being thus cooled at once, it becomes den&s;er, its parts com|ing clo&s;er together; and thus touching in a greater number of points, they cohere the more &s;trongly, and con&s;e|quently the iron is made harder.</P>
<P>THE Thermometer is the common mea&s;ure for the degrees of heat and cold; but whether a ju&s;t one may be doubted. And fir&s;t, the gla&s;s of the thermometer expands with heat, and thus hinders the a&s;cent of the &s;pirit, and contracts with cold, thus preventing its fall. Then, in a great degree of cold, the air is di&s;|charged out of the &s;pirit, and fills that part of the gla&s;s which &s;hould have no air, and by its ela&s;ticity oppo&s;es the
<PB N="257" REF="267">
ri&s;ing of the &s;pirit. And la&s;tly, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, though groundle&s;sly, that the heat is proportional to the expan&s;ion of the &s;pirit, though the contrary appears by the pyrometer.</P>
<P>IF you pour water on a table, and place on it a tin plate with &s;alted &s;now, the plate will be frozen to the table, as &s;oon as this &s;now begins to melt. For as the water is much warmer than the &s;alted &s;now, the fire mu&s;t force out of the water into the plate, and from this la&s;t into the &s;alted &s;now. And thus the water lo&s;ing its heat, turns to ice; and on the contrary, the &s;now being heated, mu&s;t melt, before which the plate is not froze to the table, the particles of fire being then gone over into the &s;now out of the water. This experiment may be made, though you &s;et the plate with the &s;alted &s;now over glowing coals, kept con&s;tantly blowing. On the plate with the &s;now lay another plate with cold water, and &s;tirring with a cane, or any
<PB N="258" REF="268">
other in&s;trument, the &s;now will di&s;&s;olve, and ice will be formed upon the water in the di&s;h. I have tried it frequently without &s;alt, and it an&s;wers, though not with equal efficacy.</P>
<P>BUT by this method we can only then make ice when we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;now or ice already: Boerhaave gives us a method of making ice without them. We mu&s;t have for this purpo&s;e, at any &s;ea&s;on of the year, the colde&s;t water we can get; this is to be mixed with a proper quantity of &s;alt, at the rate of about three ounces to a quart of water; another quart of water mu&s;t be prepared in the &s;ame manner with the fir&s;t; the &s;alt, by being di&s;&s;olved in each, will make the water, as was &s;aid above, much colder than it was before; they are then to be mixed together, and this will make them colder &s;till. Two quarts of water more prepared and mixed in the manner of the two fir&s;t, are to be mixed with the&s;e, which will increa&s;e the cold
<PB N="259" REF="269">
in a much higher degree in all. The whole of this operation is to be carried on in a cold cellar; and a gla&s;s of com|mon water is then to be placed in the ve&s;&s;el of liquor thus artificially cold, which will be turned into ice in the &s;pace of twelve hours. Of all &s;alts, <HI>&s;al ammoniac</HI> be&s;t an&s;wers this intention.</P>
<P>BUT of late there has been a more effectual method of congealing fluids than any yet mentioned. It has been di&s;covered, that fluids &s;tanding in a cur|rent of air, grow by this means much colder than before: it has been di&s;co|vered al&s;o, that all &s;ub&s;tances grow colder by the fluids they contain, or are mixed with, being evaporated. If both the&s;e methods therefore are prac|ti&s;ed upon the &s;ame body at the &s;ame time, they will increa&s;e the cold to almo&s;t any degree of inten&s;ene&s;s we de&s;ire.</P>

<P>AS by the degrees of cold or heat in bodies, we are led to e&s;timate the quantity of fire they contain; &s;o al&s;o we have another method of a&s;&s;uring our&s;elves of the exi&s;tence of fire in dif|ferent &s;ub&s;tances, by the light they &s;end forth; for wherever there is light, there is fire. Heat and light may be con|&s;idered as the children of fire, as kindred qualities produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e, but &s;ometimes exerting their powers &s;eparately, and &s;ometimes united. It is the &s;ame fire, who&s;e heat burns in the melting metal un&s;een, and who&s;e light &s;hines harmle&s;s in the glow-worm. This light, though &s;eemingly inoffen&s;ive, would burn if collected into a &s;mall compa&s;s, like the fierce&s;t flame; but no in&s;truments that art has yet found out, are able to give its parts a &s;ufficient con&s;i&s;tence.
<PB N="263" REF="273">
The flame which hangs over burning &s;pirit of wine, we all know to &s;corch with great power; yet the&s;e flames may be made to &s;hine as bright as ever, and yet be perfectly harmle&s;s. This is done by placing them over a gentle fire, and leaving them thus to evaporate in a clo&s;e room without a chimney: if a per&s;on &s;hould &s;oon after enter with a candle, he will find the whole room filled with innoxious flames. The parts have been too minutely &s;eparated, and the fluid perhaps has not force enough to &s;end forth its burning rays with &s;ufficient effect. However this be, we may &s;afely con|clude, that the parts of fire may be &s;o &s;eparated, as to become harmle&s;s, and yet they may retain all their former &s;plendour.</P>
<P>SINCE we thus &s;ee light and heat are the mo&s;t obvious indications of fire, we have no rea&s;on to doubt, but that the &s;un, who is the great fountain of both, is it&s;elf one large body of that element.
<PB N="264" REF="274">
In what manner that great fiery ma&s;s is fed, with continuing fuel to keep up his force, is a que&s;tion equally u&s;ele&s;s and impo&s;&s;ible to be re&s;olved; whether comets travel from other &s;y&s;tems with a provi&s;ion of this nature, or whether the etherial vapours come from all parts with their &s;upply, is not worth enqui|ring after. He that made the comet &s;weep through immea&s;urable tracts of &s;pace, could with equal ea&s;e give permanent fire to the &s;un: we feel the con&s;tancy of his flame, and can &s;ee &s;carce any dimi|nution of his &s;plendour. It is enough for philo&s;ophy to inve&s;tigate the nature of this heat and light; the things with which man has the neare&s;t concern, &s;hould be the chief objects of his cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>SETTING a&s;ide other &s;y&s;tems therefore, we know that the rays of the &s;un's light and heat are darted foreward from his body in &s;traight lines. If we make a &s;mall hole in a dark room, and permit a ray
<PB N="265" REF="275">
of the &s;un's light to enter, we &s;hall &s;ee it dart again&s;t the oppo&s;ite part of the wall or floor, in the &s;traighte&s;t line. Did the beams of the &s;un diffu&s;e them|&s;elves in any other manner, for in&s;tance as water or air are known to do, the ray, upon once entering the room, would &s;oon fill the whole chamber with light: but this we know to be contrary to every hour's experience. The rays of light therefore dart directly forward from the &s;un, and reach our earth with the &s;wifte&s;t progre&s;&s;ion. It might by the uninitiated be thought a ta&s;k beyond the reach of human abilities to calculate exactly, how long a ray of light is up|on its journey, in travelling from the &s;un to enlighten our hemi&s;phere. Yet this has been attempted by Romer, who finds that light travels at the rate of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and miles in a &s;ingle &s;econd; and that it is &s;even mi|nutes in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;un to the earth, which is nearly a di&s;tance of &s;eventy millions of miles. The &s;tudent
<PB N="266" REF="276">
may de&s;ire to know how he made this calculation, it was thus:</P>
<P>WHEN the earth in going its annual revolution round the &s;un is at C, (&s;ee fig. 57.) an eclip&s;e is ob&s;erved of a &s;atel|lite of Jupiter, which thus regularly &s;uffers eclip&s;es every forty-two hours and an half. If the earth never left C, but continued there immoveable, it would regularly &s;ee the &s;atellite eclip&s;ed at the expected interval of forty-two hours and an half: and al&s;o at thirty times that number, the &s;pectator would &s;ee thirty eclip&s;es. But the earth is not fixed; it travels onward to D, and a &s;pectator does not &s;ee thirty eclip&s;es in the &s;tated period, and not till &s;ome minutes after; for the further off the earth removes, the light takes &s;o much time to travel acro&s;s the annual orbit from C to D. From C to D it takes up about &s;ixteen minutes in travelling. Now the &s;un is nearly half-way between C and D, and therefore the light travelling from him,

mu&s;t perform its journey in half &s;ix|teen, that is, in eight minutes, or there|abouts.</P>
<P>SUCH is the rapidity with which the&s;e rays dart them&s;elves forward, that a journey, they perform thus in le&s;s than eight minutes, a ball from the mouth of a cannon would not complete in &s;everal weeks. But here it may be &s;aid, if the velocity of the light is &s;o very great, how is it that it doth not &s;trike again&s;t objects with a force equal to its &s;wiftne&s;s? If the fine&s;t &s;and, the objector may continue to ob&s;erve, were thrown again&s;t our bodies with the hundredth part of this velocity, each grain would be as fatal as the &s;tab of a &s;tiletto: how then is it, that we expo&s;e without pain, not only other parts of our bodies to the incur&s;ions of light, but our eyes, which are a part &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible of every impre&s;&s;ion? To an|&s;wer this objection, experiment will in|form us, that the minutene&s;s of the
<PB N="268" REF="279">
parts of light are &s;till &s;everal degrees beyond their velocity; and they are therefore harmle&s;s, becau&s;e &s;o very &s;mall. A ray of light is nothing more than a con&s;tant &s;tream of minute parts &s;till flowing from the luminary, &s;o incon|ceivably little, that a candle, in a &s;ingle &s;econd of time, has been &s;aid to diffu&s;e &s;everal hundreds of millions more par|ticles of light, than there could be grains in the whole earth, if it were entirely one heap of &s;and. The &s;un furni&s;hes them, and the &s;tars al&s;o, with|out appearing in the lea&s;t to con&s;ume, by granting us the &s;upply. Mu&s;k, while it diffu&s;es its odour, wa&s;tes as it perfumes us; but the &s;un's light is diffu&s;ed in a wide &s;phere, and &s;eems inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>HIS rays travel onward without hin|derance or mutual interruption; winds meet and de&s;troy each other's force, but the rays of light never oppo&s;e their mutual progre&s;s. If we place a row of candles (&s;ays the &s;en&s;ible Mr. Fer|Fergu&s;on)
<PB N="269" REF="280">
on a table, and let them dart rays through a pinhole in a piece of black paper, the&s;e rays being received upon any object not too far off, will be formed into as many &s;pecks of light, as there are candles; each &s;peck being di&s;|tinct and clear, the rays from one candle being no way de&s;troyed, by any interrup|tion of tho&s;e from another. The rays of a torch may be overpowered, and &s;eem lo&s;t in the brighter rays of the &s;un, yet &s;till the &s;maller candle actually &s;hines with undimini&s;hed radiance; as we may &s;ee by looking at it by night and by day through a tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>AS light is thus driven forward in rays from a center, it mu&s;t decrea&s;e, as all rays do, in proportion as the di&s;|tance &s;quared becomes greater. Gravity, &s;ounds, and light are, in this re&s;pect, &s;imilar; a luminary that enlightens the mountain's &s;ide at a mile di&s;tance, will illuminate four times as feebly at two miles di&s;tance. If I can but ju&s;t read
<PB N="270" REF="281">
with a candle placed a yard from me, I mu&s;t have four candles if they are placed two yards off. In a word, the quantity of light decrea&s;es inver&s;ely as the &s;quare of the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>TO make any body vi&s;ible, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the rays of light &s;hould fall upon it; otherwi&s;e it will paint no image on the eye, nor tran&s;mit any but that of darkne&s;s to the mind. Objects placed in a dark room cannot be &s;een; but if the &s;a&s;h be lifted up, and the light be thrown in a greater quantity, we may have a confu&s;ed idea of the figure of the furniture; however, until the room be entirely illuminated, and the rays that fall on every object be reflected back to our eyes, we can have no di&s;tinct per|ceptions. For this rea&s;on, a per&s;on who remains him&s;elf in the dark with an hole to peep through, can &s;ee all objects without, becau&s;e their rays can be re|flected to his eye; but, as was &s;aid be|fore, he cannot from without &s;ee clearly
<PB N="271" REF="282">
into a dark room, becau&s;e there are too &s;mall a number of rays &s;ent from thence to form the picture of the object in his eye.</P>
<P>WHEN I u&s;e the word Picture, it &s;hould be under&s;tood in the mo&s;t literal &s;en&s;e. Every object that we behold has its picture drawn mo&s;t exactly, and in colours far beyond the reach of art, on the back part of the eye. To be convinced of this, we have only to take the eye of an ox or &s;heep, and &s;tripping off all the coats to the la&s;t internal one behind, place it &s;o in the hole in the win|dow &s;hutter of a dark room, &s;o as that no light what&s;oever &s;hall enter but through the eye it&s;elf thus prepared. Then taking a &s;heet of white paper, and hold|ing it nearer or farther off behind the eye, the &s;pectators will perceive a mo&s;t beautiful picture of the objects without thrown upon the paper, through the humours of the eye. Every object, however, will be inverted up&s;ide down

upon the paper, or, as the vulgar ex|pre&s;s it, they will all &s;tand upon their heads, the cau&s;e of which demands ex|planation.</P>
<P>BUT before we enter into a more minute illu&s;tration of the manner in which vi&s;ion is performed, we mu&s;t ex|plain more minutely the nature of light it&s;elf, by which the eye is thus made capable of &s;eeing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IV. Of the Refraction of Light.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that the parts of light are extremely &s;mall, and flow from the &s;un with inconceivable rapidity. We ob&s;erved al&s;o, that they darted from that great luminary in &s;traight rays; but this is not entirely the ca&s;e, for the rays may be bent into crooked lines by pa&s;&s;ing through tran&s;parent bodies of different den&s;ities. We &s;ee a &s;tick when put into water, appear as if it were broken, at the &s;urface of the water, in two. We &s;ee through &s;ome gla&s;&s;es bodies appear enormou&s;ly large, and through others they appear extremely little. Through &s;ome they &s;eem near, and through others remote. From whence ari&s;e the&s;e &s;trange appearances, or what is the cau&s;e which thus bends the &s;traight &s;tick &s;eemingly into a curve; apparently that magnifies the bulk of one object, or dimini&s;hes that of ano|ther?
<PB N="274" REF="285">
All the&s;e wonders ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e; the rays of light, in pa&s;&s;ing through different tran&s;parent &s;ub&s;tances, take different directions. To explain this:</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS have agreed to call any tran&s;parent body, through which light pa&s;&s;es a <HI>medium.</HI> Air is a medi|um; water, gla&s;s, diamonds are medi|ums; wherever light pa&s;&s;es, though it be a vacuum it&s;elf, they call that a <HI>medium.</HI> Now, while the rays of light dart through any medium of uniform den&s;ity, they are &s;traight; but when they pa&s;s o|bliquely through one medium into ano|ther, then they are <HI>refracted,</HI> broken, or driven out of their right lined cour&s;e into a crooked direction. As a &s;traight &s;tick one half in the medium of water, and the other half in the medium of air, appears broken in two, ju&s;t where the two mediums unite.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew that a ray of light is thus refracted by pa&s;&s;ing from air to water,

an ea&s;y experiment will &s;uffice. Let a &s;un beam be permitted to enter into the room by an hole; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the chamber &s;hould be darkened for this purpo&s;e. Then &s;et an empty ve&s;&s;el, as A B (&s;ee fig. 58) in &s;uch a po&s;ition, that the ray &s;hall fir&s;t glance upon the edge of the ve&s;&s;el, and then fall upon the bottom. Put a &s;hilling at the bot|tom E. where the ray falls; then fill the ve&s;&s;el with water. We &s;hall find that then the ray will not fall upon the &s;hilling at E, but fall nearer under the edge B C. So that the ray will now fall more perpendicularly to the &s;urface of the water, than it would if it had &s;uffered no refraction.</P>
<P>AS the ray is thus refracted or broken more into the perpendicular, in pa&s;&s;ing from the air into the water, &s;o will it be refracted, in a contrary way, in pa&s;&s;ing from water into air. For, let us &s;uppo&s;e, the ve&s;&s;el once more empty, and the &s;hilling at E hiding its rays from the &s;pectator's
<PB N="276" REF="288">
eye, at F. If the ve&s;&s;el be then filled with water, the rays of light, now pa&s;&s;ing from the den&s;er medium of water into the thinner medium of air, will fir&s;t mount up almo&s;t perpendicularly to C. and then getting into the air will pa&s;s more ob|liquely forward to hit the &s;pectator's eye. So that the &s;hilling will thus be|come vi&s;ible. Ju&s;t thus the fer|rel of my cane, if put into the water, would appear rai&s;ed, like the &s;hilling; and therefore, if the ferrel be rai&s;ed, the other parts of the cane that are in the water, mu&s;t al&s;o be rai&s;ed nearer to the eye, &s;o that it will appear broken in two, ju&s;t where the air and water meet. Thus then, we have &s;een that a ray of light, pa&s;&s;ing from a thinner medium into a den&s;er, as from air into water, is refracted more directly downward, or more perpendicularly to the &s;urface of the den&s;e medium. On the contrary, the ray, pa&s;&s;ing from water into air is, upon its entrance into the air, &s;ent for|ward more obliquely. Hence then, we
<PB N="277" REF="289">
may univer&s;ally conclude, that the den&s;er the medium, the more perpen|dicularly to its &s;urface are the rays of light refracted. To give the learner the mo&s;t di&s;tinct ideas po&s;&s;ible of this, we &s;aid, the refraction of light was great|e&s;t in the den&s;e&s;t mediums. Suppo&s;e the ray A E (&s;ee fig. 59) falls upon a va&s;e of water, it is refracted from the &s;traight line at the &s;urface of the water to D. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the perpendicular B E C drawn to the &s;urface of the wa|ter, the ray of light A E makes an angle with the perpendicular B. It al&s;o makes a different angle with the &s;ame perpendicular, in going from E to D. The difference between the&s;e two angles is that which mea&s;ures the greatne&s;s of the refraction of the ray. The two angles always bear a con&s;tant proportion to each other. The greater the angle A B, the greater will be the angle D C. To know the names u&s;ed in &s;cience is, at la&s;t, become a part of &s;cience. The
<PB N="278" REF="290">
angle B A thus made by the perpendi|cular and the ray, before refraction, is called the angle of incidence. The an|gle D C, made by the &s;ame lines, after refraction, is called the angle of re|fraction.</P>
<P>NOW then, a ray of light pa&s;&s;ing from air to water, is found by expe|rience to have its angle of incidence B A, bearing the &s;ame proportion to its angle of refraction D C as three does to four; or in other words, it is a fourth part greater in the air than in the water. In gla&s;s, the angle of incidence is a third part greater than the angle of refraction, the proportion being about three to two. Diamond refracts mo&s;t of all, the an|gle of incidence being three times greater than the angle of refraction.</P>
<P>FROM hence then we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the den&s;er the medium, the more per|pendicular
<PB N="279" REF="291">
does a ray of light, falling on its &s;urface obliquely, pa&s;s through it; that is, it takes the &s;horte&s;t way. It takes a &s;horter cut in pa&s;&s;ing through diamond than gla&s;s, and through gla&s;s than through water; &s;o that we &s;ee, the den&s;er the body the more readily it per|vades them. This is very extraordinary, and very different from the nature of other bodies, pa&s;&s;ing through ob&s;truct|ing mediums. If I &s;hould throw a leaden bullet obliquely into the water, it would not reach the bottom in the direction I had given it, but the water would in &s;ome mea&s;ure keep it buoyant, and it would come with a greater &s;lant to the bottom. But it is very different with a ray of light; when it darts ob|liquely on the &s;urface of the water, it then begins to de&s;cend more perpendi|cularly downwards. What can be the cau&s;e of this extraordinary diver&s;ity in the operations of nature? Several phi|lo&s;ophers have attempted this &s;olution in
<PB N="280" REF="292">
vain: Newton attempted, and it no longer appeared a &s;ecret. The cau&s;e of light being thus perpendicularly re|fracted by the mo&s;t den&s;e mediums, is, that the parts of it are mo&s;t attracted by the mo&s;t den&s;e mediums. All bodies as we well know, attract and are attract|ed in proportion to their quantity of matter. The light, from its minutene&s;s, pa&s;&s;es with equal ea&s;e through the harde&s;t diamonds or the &s;ofte&s;t air; it meets in the den&s;e&s;t mediums nothing to retard its progre&s;s, but much to increa&s;e its celerity, for it obeys the influence of their &s;uperior attractions. Every in&s;tant of its de&s;cent or progre&s;s through the den&s;er mediums, it feels new influence from the attracting power. A bullet thrown from the hand obliquely into water, goes downward yet more obliquely; for the water in &s;ome mea&s;ure, takes off from its natural gravity and keeps it buoy|nant: a ray of light, on the contrary, darting obliquely upon the water, has
<PB N="281" REF="293">
the obliquity of its fall interrupted by attraction, and con&s;equently falls more perpendicularly down; though, rigor|ou&s;ly &s;peaking, the ray, in its de&s;cent through water or gla&s;s, is not refracted from the &s;urface to the bottom in a &s;traight line, but a crooked one; &s;o that the line from E to D (&s;ee fig. 60.) is an ab&s;olute curve.</P>
<P>THAT bodies have this power of at|tracting the rays of light, may be known from the following ea&s;y experiment. Set a &s;mall pointed penknife &s;tanding with its point upward; (&s;ee fig. 61.) let the room be made perfectly dark, and a ray of light be permitted to glance in, &s;o as ju&s;t to touch the point of the penknife: the ray, upon touching the metal will bend it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that the part of it which is neare&s;t the point, will be mo&s;t refracted, and that farthe&s;t from the point, will &s;uffer the lea&s;t re|fraction; a proof, that the metal attracts
<PB N="282" REF="294">
tho&s;e neare&s;t it with the greate&s;t force. If the point thus can refract the rays by its attracting power at a &s;mall di&s;tance, any den&s;e &s;ub&s;tance through which they pa&s;s mu&s;t more powerfully attract them, as the di&s;tance is nothing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Pa&s;&s;age of Light through Gla&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een the manner in which water refracts the rays of light that pa&s;s through it; but the con&s;ide|ration of that part of the &s;ubject, though plea&s;ing, is only a matter of cu|rio&s;ity; an inve&s;tigation of the man|ner of its refractions through gla&s;s is connected very nearly both with our nece&s;&s;ities and plea&s;ures. When a ray of light pa&s;&s;es out of air into gla&s;s, its angle of incidence is to its angle of re|fraction, as we &s;aid above, as three to two; that is, the angle of incidence is a third part larger than that of refraction: upon this &s;ingle principle depends the whole theory of vi&s;ion through gla&s;&s;es.</P>

to give the learner an idea of its figure. A three &s;quare razor &s;trap, as the vulgar expre&s;s it, will give a re&s;emblance of the pri&s;m. I have &s;een the &s;hank of a large drinking gla&s;s taken and ground down, &s;o as to have three flat &s;ides, which an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of a pri&s;m tolerably well. All the&s;e gla&s;&s;es mentioned above, are called by the com|mon name of Len&s;es.</P>
<P>THE more obliquely a ray of light falls upon any one of the&s;e, as we &s;aid before, the greater will be the angle of incidence, and con&s;equently greater will be the angle of refraction. If, therefore, the &s;olar rays fall upon one of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es with a &s;urface not quite flat, but irregular, it is very evident that the &s;ame rays will fall with different obliquities upon the&s;e different &s;urfaces, and con&s;e|quently be differently refracted, or bent, in their pa&s;&s;age through the gla&s;&s;es. Let us illu&s;trate this in every particular gla&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="299">A ray of light A B C falling (&s;ee fig. 63) perpendicularly on a plain gla&s;s, is never refracted; but if it falls obliquely it will be refracted upon its entrance into the den&s;er gla&s;&s;y medium, and be again refracted upon its exit from behind the gla&s;s into the air. It will alter its di|rection as it goes into the gla&s;s; but upon going out, it will re&s;ume the &s;ame direction with which it entered. Thus it will be refracted in the line B C, upon entering; and upon going out will be again refracted in the line C D.</P>
<P>IF &s;everal rays of light fall together on a gla&s;s E D, convex on one &s;ide (&s;ee fig. 64) they will be differently re|fracted, in proportion to the obliquity with which each of them falls upon the &s;urface. The middle ray, for in&s;tance, which pa&s;&s;es perpendicularly through, will not be refracted at all, but go on &s;traight forward. All the other rays, however, will &s;uffer refraction. The
<PB N="287" REF="300">
ray C E will be refracted upwards to F; the ray A D will be refracted downwards to the &s;ame point. There they will cro&s;s, and then go onward, diverging or &s;eparating from each other for ever; that which came from the bottom going upward, and that which came from the top downward. The figure we have given there is flat, but it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed round, the gla&s;s being repre&s;ented edge|ways. If &s;o, therefore, the collected bundle of rays, pa&s;&s;ing through the gla&s;s, unite and form a cone, or a figure like a candle extingui&s;her, the bottom of which is at the gla&s;s, and the point at F. This point, as we once before had occa&s;ion to mention, is called the focus of the gla&s;s. From a calculation in deep geo|metry we learn, that the di&s;tance from this point is always equal to the dia|meter of the circle which the gla&s;s would make if its convexity were con|tinued.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301">WHEN the rays of the &s;un fall di|rectly upon a gla&s;s D E (&s;ee fig. 65) equally convex on both &s;ides, they will be refracted &s;till more abruptly, and meet &s;ooner in a point or principal focus at F. The di&s;tance of this focus is, we are informed by the &s;ame ab&s;tru&s;e calculation, equal to the &s;emi-diameter of the circle, which the convexity of the gla&s;s continued would make. Either this gla&s;s or the former, as they collect the rays of the &s;un into a point, will burn at that point, &s;ince the whole force of the rays is concentrated there. Their &s;urpri&s;ing power in this way we have had occa&s;ion to mention before. The broader the gla&s;s in the&s;e in&s;truments, the greater will be its power.</P>
<P>AS parallel rays, &s;triking upon the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, are thus converged to a point, it mu&s;t naturally follow, that when the rays, diffu&s;ing them&s;elves from a point, as from a candle, &s;trike one of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, they will be refracted parallel.
<PB N="289" REF="302">
If, therefore, we place a candle at a fo|cal di&s;tance from one or both of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, as at <HI>f,</HI> its rays will, upon going through the gla&s;s, all run parallel to each other. If the candle be placed nearer the gla&s;s than its focal di&s;tance, the rays, after pa&s;&s;ing through the gla&s;s, will no longer run parallel, but &s;eparate or diverge: if it be placed further off, the rays will then &s;trike the gla&s;s more parallel, and will therefore, upon pa&s;&s;|ing through it, converge or unite at &s;ome di&s;tance behind the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT it is very remarkable, that where the&s;e rays fall, as in the &s;olar rays, they not only unite, but they al&s;o form an inverted picture of the flame of the can|dle, as may be &s;een on a paper placed at the meeting of the rays behind! How the image is inverted is ea&s;y to appre|hend; for we ob&s;erved above, that the upper rays, after refraction, were &s;uch as came from the under part of the lu|minous body; and that the under rays,
<PB N="290" REF="303">
on the contrary, came from its top: &s;o that the rays are turned up-&s;ide down, and &s;o con&s;equently is the image. It is very plea&s;ing to view a picture of this kind thus formed, each ray pre&s;erving the colour it had in the luminous object, with the mo&s;t imitative preci&s;ion. The &s;hadings of the little piece are far be|yond the reach of art, and the de&s;ign far more correct than that of the fine&s;t painter. We mention the candle as being an obvious luminary; but if any object what&s;oever be placed at the proper di|&s;tance from a convex gla&s;s, its picture will be in the &s;ame manner thrown be|hind, and may be received upon paper, or any other body what&s;oever, in all its natural proportions and colourings. The nearer the natural object is to the re|fracting gla&s;s, the farther off will this picture be behind it; becau&s;e, as we &s;aid before, the rays which form it do not then converge or unite, but at a great focal di&s;tance. The farther off the natural object is, the nearer will be
<PB N="291" REF="304">
the focal di&s;tance it makes, and con&s;e|quently the nearer will be the picture behind the gla&s;s; for wherever the fo|cus is, there will the perfect picture be. However, when the rays come from &s;eve|ral objects at a moderate di&s;tance, they may be then con&s;idered as all parallel, and this difference of focus is then im|perceptible.</P>
<P>TO put what has been &s;aid in other words &mdash; As the rays of the &s;un may be all con&s;idered as falling parallel upon every gla&s;s of the convex kind, &s;o they mu&s;t always unite behind it in a focal point. As all the rays flowing from other objects are not always parallel, when placed too near the gla&s;s, they &s;eparate after refraction, and run off divergent; when placed at a proper di|&s;tance, they unite or converge in a fo|cal point, and there imprint a picture, if there be any thing properly placed to receive it, in which the natural figure
<PB N="292" REF="305">
will be repre&s;ented, its motions, its co|lours, and &s;hadings.</P>
<P>THE whole foregoing theory may be demon&s;trated with a common reading-gla&s;s. If a candle is held &s;o near it, as that the rays pa&s;&s;ing through &s;hall &s;trike the wain&s;cot of the chamber with a bright &s;pot, ju&s;t as large as the gla&s;s it&s;elf, the candle is then at the focal di&s;tance; and rays, &s;triking the gla&s;s divergently, are re|fracted through it, parallel to each other, neither &s;preading nor drawing together as they proceed. If the candle is held nearer than the focal di&s;tance, the rays will fall then more divergent upon the gla&s;s, and will con&s;equently be refracted more divergent, &s;o that they will form a very broad &s;pot of light upon the wain|&s;cot. If the candle be placed at a much greater di&s;tance than the focus, the rays fall upon the gla&s;s more parallel, and con&s;equently when they are refracted will tend to unite and converge behind
<PB N="293" REF="306">
the gla&s;s, and will form but a &s;mall &s;peck of vivid light on the wain&s;cot. This &s;peck, if clo&s;ely examined, will ap|pear a perfect picture of the candle.</P>
<P>EVERY vi&s;ible point, in any body what&s;oever, may be con&s;idered as a can|dle &s;ending forth its ray, which &s;plits and <HI>pencils</HI> out into &s;everal other rays before it arrives at the eye. Each body is as if compo&s;ed of an infinite number of &s;plen|did points or candles, each point with its own radiance, and diffu&s;ing it&s;elf on every &s;ide. In&s;tead of one body, the eye in fact is impre&s;&s;ed with thou&s;ands of radiant points &s;ent out from that body, which being grouped at the bottom of the eye, imprint the picture of the ob|ject from whence they flow. Each point &s;ends forth its ray.</P>
<P>NOW, if, in&s;tead of candle light, we u&s;e that of the &s;un, by holding this gla&s;s oppo&s;ite his beams, as the&s;e all &s;trike the gla&s;s parallel to each other, they
<PB N="294" REF="307">
will be united &s;oon into a focus behind, and where they unite will burn with great fiercene&s;s. Suppo&s;e we adapt this gla&s;s, &s;o as to fit an hole in the window-&s;hutter of a darkened chamber, &s;o as that no light &s;hall come into the room but through the gla&s;s; then let us place a &s;heet of white paper behind it at the proper di|&s;tance, we &s;hall thus have a <HI>camera ob&s;cura</HI>; for a picture of every external object will pa&s;s through the gla&s;s, and be painted upon the paper in the mo&s;t beautiful colours that imagination can conceive, and all the motions of tho&s;e objects al&s;o. It is nece&s;&s;ary, in this experiment, that the window &s;hould not be oppo&s;ite the &s;un; for then we &s;hould &s;ee no image but that of his brightne&s;s: and yet it is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o, that while we make the experiment, the &s;un &s;hould &s;hine and il|luminate the objects &s;trongly, which are to paint them&s;elves within. With|out this &s;trong illumination, the rays will be &s;ent &s;o feebly from every object,
<PB N="295" REF="308">
that we &s;hall have but a very faint pic|ture, if any at all.</P>
<P>PAINTERS and architects often make u&s;e of a &s;imilar contrivance to take a draught of land&s;kips or buildings: their gla&s;s is fixed in a box, and by means of a mirrour, on which the objects fall, they are reflected upon oiled paper pro|perly placed, upon which the arti&s;t &s;ketches his draught. With regard to the contours, or out-lines, which this picture gives, nothing can be more ex|act; but, with regard to the &s;hading and colouring, the arti&s;t can expect but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from it: for, as the &s;un is every moment altering its &s;ituation, &s;o is the land&s;kip every moment varying its &s;hade; and &s;o &s;wift is this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new &s;hade, that while the painter is copy|ing one part of a &s;hade, the other part is lo&s;t, and a new &s;hade is thrown upon &s;ome other object.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="309">IF &s;uch a gla&s;s be &s;o fitted to an hole in a dark lantern, &s;o that little pictures, painted in tran&s;parent colours on pieces of gla&s;s, may be pa&s;&s;ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively along between the gla&s;s and the candle in the lantern, we &s;hall thus have a magic lan|tern. The pictures, &s;triking the gla&s;s very divergent, will be refracted very divergent al&s;o, and will be painted upon the wall of the chamber in all their co|lours, as large as we plea&s;e to make them; for the farther the wall is from the gla&s;s, the more room will the rays have to di|verge. To illuminate the little figures more &s;trongly, another gla&s;s mu&s;t be u&s;ed, which may either reflect or re|fract the light of the candle upon them.</P>
<P>BUT of all the optical in&s;truments that we know, tho&s;e made by art are nothing to the natural one of the eye, which has its convex gla&s;&s;es, and diffe|rently refracting mediums, all adju&s;ted in the mo&s;t admirable order, while a fine tape&s;try is hung behind to receive

the image from without. But, to quit tawdry common-place ob&s;ervations, let us de&s;cribe the <HI>eye</HI> it&s;elf, and trace Nature through her various operations in that wonderful piece of mechani&s;m.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Eye.</HEAD>
<P>THE eye is nearly globular, as we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve by the eyes of &s;heep or oxen when taken out of the head. But it is not perfectly round; for, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, it bli&s;|ters out a little before, as at E, (&s;ee fig. 66.)</P>
<P>WE all know that the eye of an ox is compo&s;ed of an external coat or &s;kin, which, like a bladder filled with water, contains a fluid within it. This ex|ternal coat is made up of three coats, one without the other, like the bark of a tree, which may be &s;eparated into three coverings; and the fluid within al&s;o is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed into three tran&s;parent humours of different den&s;i|ties;
<PB N="299" REF="312">
one of them as thin as water, the other like jelly, and the third as hard as gum arabic.</P>
<P>BUT fir&s;t as to the three coats of the eye. When we take the eye of an ox from the head, we fir&s;t find an outward fle&s;hy &s;kin almo&s;t covering the ball of the eye, which does not properly be|long to it, but to the &s;kull. It is not reckoned among the coats of the eye, although it makes what we call the white of the eye. Now then, this mem|brane being taken away, there are under it three proper coats belonging to the eye. The outward coat is called the <HI>&s;clerotica,</HI> a finer coat next this is called the <HI>choroides,</HI> and the mo&s;t internal of all is the <HI>retina,</HI> which covers chiefly the internal back part of the eye. The outward coat, or <HI>&s;clerotica,</HI> is tran&s;pa|rent, like horn, on the fore-part of the eye, and that part of it is therefore called the <HI>cornea,</HI> or horny-coat. The <HI>cornea</HI> is repre&s;ented by D E G. The &s;e|cond
<PB N="300" REF="313">
coat, or <HI>choroides,</HI> does not line the <HI>cornea,</HI> as it does the other parts of the upper coat, but leaves a pa&s;&s;age be|fore for the light to enter, opening in a &s;ort of mouth, which is gathered or ex|panded by little fibres, which open it or contract it, as running &s;trings do the mouth of a pur&s;e. The&s;e fibres are called the <HI>iris,</HI> and may be &s;een through the tran&s;parent <HI>cornea,</HI> and they al&s;o give the denomination of colour to the eye. Whenever there comes too much light to the eye, the circular fibres of the <HI>iris</HI> contract the opening; whenever the light is rather wanted, the radial fibres of the <HI>iris,</HI> on every &s;ide, draw the hole more open. The little hole, which the <HI>iris</HI> thus contracts or dilates, is no other than the pupil or &s;ight: that little black &s;peck, which we &s;ee &s;o &s;hining in every eye, and which we know to be &s;ometimes larger and &s;ometimes le&s;s. The mo&s;t internal coat is the <HI>retina:</HI> this lies at the back of the eye, and &s;ome|what re&s;embles a &s;pider's web.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="314">THE coats of the eye being thus di&s;|po&s;ed, the fluid within is di&s;tingui&s;hed in the following manner. In the fore-part of the eye, ju&s;t behind the <HI>cornea,</HI> lies a fine tran&s;parent fluid like water: it gives that protuberance to the eye on the fore-part, which was mentioned in the beginning, and fills up the cavity <HI>m m</HI> and <HI>n n.</HI> Farther backwards lies the cry&s;talline humour L L, of the con&s;i&s;tence of gum arabic, and pretty much &s;haped like a &s;mall horn-button mould: it &s;tands with the mo&s;t convex &s;ide backwards, and it is &s;ometimes brought forward a little by fibres, called the Ciliary Circle, which go round its edges like a hoop. Hindmo&s;t of all the humours lies that called the Vitreous Humour, K K, of the con&s;i&s;tence of a jelly, perfectly tran&s;parent, and in great quantity, filling all the back part of the eye. Now then, if we have a clear idea of the foregoing de&s;cription, we mu&s;t know, that the aqueous or watery hu|mour lies foremo&s;t in the eye, that the

<PB N="301" REF="316">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="302" REF="317">
hard cry&s;talline humour &s;tands farther back, by being placed behind the pupil, or hole of the eye, as we would fix a gla&s;s behind the hole of a window-&s;hutter in a darkened room. Behind this is the vitreous humour, filling the whole backward apartment of the eye. If we expo&s;e a &s;heep's eye in an hard fro&s;t to one night's freezing, the next morn|ing all the humours of the eye will be frozen, and we may with a &s;harp knife cut the icy globe in two parts; by which means we &s;hall have the mo&s;t di|&s;tinct view of the three humours, as they lie within their external covering.</P>
<P>IF by this time the reader has &s;ome idea of the &s;tructure of the eye, the na|ture and manner of vi&s;ion will be ea&s;ily conceived. As every point of every vi&s;ible object &s;ends forth rays that &s;trike the eye, let us &s;uppo&s;e a vi&s;ual ray coming from the upper point of the external object A B. This, like all rays coming from a point, will diverge and &s;eparate
<PB N="303" REF="318">
as it goes along, and when it arrives at the <HI>cornea</HI> of the eye it will be &s;pread upon its &s;urface. Here, however, it is refracted by the aqueous humour, and thus it will be converged into a compa&s;s &s;mall enough to pa&s;s through the pupil, behind which it falls upon the cry&s;tal|line humour where it is &s;till more re|fracted; &s;o that by the time it has pa&s;&s;ed thence it is nearly collected into a focal point, but &s;till converg|ing yet more as it proceeds through the vitreous humour, it will at la&s;t fall upon the back of the eye in a point: and thus there will be as many points formed on the back of the eye as there were vi&s;ual rays &s;ent from every part of the object; &s;o that the whole picture of the object will be formed on the back part of the eye. The po&s;ition, however, of the object will be inverted, the bot|tom rays being refracted uppermo&s;t and inver&s;ely, as we more than once had occa&s;ion to mention. The picture being thus formed, it is painted on the back part
<PB N="304" REF="319">
of the eye, or the retina, which is only a fine expan&s;ion of the optic nerve, that is in&s;erted towards the back part of the eye. This nerve runs to the brain, and by that means all its pictures are conveyed to the common &s;en&s;ory.</P>
<P>IT has been a &s;ubject of great inquiry to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e how we come to &s;ee every object in its natural upright po|&s;ition, when we know it to be inverted on the organ of &s;en&s;ation. How when Nature draws the picture the wrong way, we &s;o readily correct her errors and place it right again, even without being con&s;cious of our rectitude. To &s;olve this, &s;ome &s;ay that we certainly &s;ee every object the wrong way, but that our judgment fir&s;t corrected the error, and habit corrects it in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. To cor|rect this error at fir&s;t, demanded an effort of the mind; but con&s;tant cu&s;|tom at length grew a &s;econd na|ture, &s;o that, in a &s;hort time, our cor|rections became mechanical and in|&s;tantaneous.
<PB N="305" REF="320">
Judgment corrects &s;o often, that it forgets that it corrects at all. As the motion of a trade&s;man's arms are fir&s;t acquired by &s;tudy and art, after a time he becomes in&s;en&s;ible of their exerci&s;e, and even in his very walk, they often, again&s;t his will, betray his profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o, &s;ay they, we have <HI>taught</HI> our eyes the art of &s;eeing differently from what they would in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>THIS is but a weak way of accounting for the cau&s;es of things. According to them we are under continual deceptions; how then can we tru&s;t our judgements that what they tell us is not a deception? The truth is, if there be any real re&s;em|blance between things and our &s;en&s;a|tions; as the image is inverted in pa&s;&s;ing through the humours of the eye, why may it not as well be again inverted in its pa&s;&s;age from the optic nerve to the brain, the picture on the eye is im|material in this con&s;ideration; the pic|ture on the brain or common &s;en&s;ory is
<PB N="306" REF="321">
all that we &s;hould &s;trive to di&s;cover, and that may, for ought we know, be upright enough; rea&s;on does not contradict this, and every moment's experience con|firms it.</P>
<P>BUT to go on with the nature of vi&s;ion. Though the three humours of the eye be requi&s;ite in &s;eeing objects di&s;tinctly and at the proper di&s;tances, yet we can &s;ee tolerably well, even though one of them &s;hould be taken away, particularly if we a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ight by gla&s;&s;es. It very often happens that the cry&s;talline humour lo&s;es its tran&s;|parency, and thus prevents the admi&s;&s;ion of the vi&s;ual rays to the back parts of the eye. This di&s;order is called by the &s;urgeons, a cataract. As we know that the cry&s;talline humour &s;tands edgeways behind the pupil, all then that we have to do, is to make it lie flat in the bottom of the eye, and it will no longer bar up the rays that come in at the pupil. A &s;urgeon, therefore, takes a fine &s;traight
<PB N="307" REF="322">
awl, and thru&s;ting it through the coats of the eye, he depre&s;&s;es the cry&s;talline into the bottom of the eye, and there leaves it. Or &s;ometimes he cuts the coats of the eye, the cry&s;talline and the aqueous humour bur&s;t out together; in &s;ome hours the wound clo&s;es, a new aqueous humour returns, and the eye continues to &s;ee, by the means of a gla&s;s, without its cry&s;talline humour. This operation is called couching for the ca|taract. Che&s;elden once couched a boy who had been blind from his birth with a cataract. Being thus introduced, in a manner, to a new world, every object pre&s;ented &s;omething to plea&s;e, a&s;toni&s;h, or terrify him. The mo&s;t regular figures gave him the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, the dark|e&s;t colours di&s;plea&s;ed, and even affrighted him. The fir&s;t time he was re&s;tored, he thought he actually touched whatever he &s;aw; but by degrees his experience cor|rected his numberle&s;s mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>THE eye may be remedied when the cry&s;talline humour only is faulty; but when
<PB N="308" REF="323">
there happens to be a defect in the optic nerve L, which carries the image to the brain, then the di&s;order is almo&s;t ever incurable. It is called the <HI>gutta &s;erena,</HI> a di&s;order in which the eye is, to all appearance, as capable of &s;eeing as in the &s;ound &s;tate; but, notwith&s;tanding, the per&s;on remains for life in utter darkne&s;s. The nerve is in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;carce any medicine can re&s;tore its lo&s;t &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>BUT though the optic nerve be thus the only conductor by which images are conveyed to the brain, yet there is an artery running through the mid&s;t of it, upon which, if the rays from an object happen to fall, there will be no picture what&s;oever formed, and the object will remain un&s;een. That part of any image which falls upon the artery in the mid|dle of the optic nerve, is entirely lo&s;t; for arteries have no &s;en&s;ibility, and con&s;equently no power of percep|tion. An ea&s;y experiment will &s;how this. If we fix three black patches

Or, if he &s;huts his left eye, and directs the right towards A, he will &s;ee both A and C, but B will di&s;appear; and if he directs his eye towards B, he will &s;ee both B and A, but not C. Whatever patch falls under the artery is un&s;een. This re|quires a little practice; but the &s;pectator may &s;oon become &s;o expert, as by the direction of his eye to lo&s;e whatever patch he thinks proper. In our ordi|nary intercour&s;e with vi&s;ible objects, we are no way &s;en&s;ible of this defect in our &s;ight; becau&s;e we turn the vi&s;ual parts
<PB N="310" REF="326">
of the eye with &s;o much rapidity upon the invi&s;ible part of the object. All lo&s;&s;es that la&s;t but for an in&s;tant are im|perceptible; each moment that the eyes twinkle we remain in utter darkne&s;s; the &s;hort duration of our want alleviates it.</P>
<P>THE nearer any object is to the eye, the larger is the angle by which it will appear in the eye, and therefore the greater will be the &s;eeming magnitude of that body. Nothing can be more obvious. Suppo&s;e the object H K (&s;ee fig. 68) re|moved at a hundred yards di&s;tance, it will form an angle in the eye at A. At two hundred yards di&s;tance, the angle it makes will be twice as little in the eye at B. Thus to whatever moderate di&s;tance the object is removed, the angle it forms in the eye will be proportionably le&s;s, and therefore the object will be dimi|ni&s;hed in the &s;ame proportion. From this diminution of the magnitude of bodies we generally judge of their di&s;|tance.

I &s;ee a man upon the mountain &s;ide; he really appears to my eye an hundred times le&s;s than the child that &s;tands near me. In&s;tead of &s;aying that the man is le&s;s than the child, I correct the information of the &s;en&s;e, and &s;ay that the child is much nearer me than the man. However, after all, it is, at pre&s;ent, with a great &s;hew of rea&s;on di&s;|puted, whether the&s;e angles have much to do in vi&s;ion; a child one yard di&s;tant from the eye appears under twice the angle of a tall man four yards from the eye; yet we know that painters, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to imitate nature, make no &s;uch abrupt diminutions in per&s;pective; their men, though ten yards behind, are larger than their children on the fore|ground of the canvas. The rule of angles therefore, is not ob&s;erved in bodies very near, nor does it make any di&s;tinction in the di&s;tances of objects very remote. The cele&s;tial bodies &s;eem all &s;tuck upon the &s;ame &s;tarry vault, at one di&s;tance; the mountain's top, when

The vi&s;ual angle therefore, under which a body is &s;een, will only be ju&s;tly dimini&s;hed at mo|derately remote di&s;tances. Yet, after all, though the per&s;pective diminution of objects give us an ob&s;cure idea of their di&s;tance, yet painters are obliged to call in another art to their aid, to give their figures the proper degree of remotene&s;s; they &s;pread over each a thick colouring of air; for the more remote the object, the more do its own colours &s;eem lo&s;t in that of the intervening atmo&s;phere. This is called <HI>keeping,</HI> for by this means every object in a picture &s;eems to keep its proper di&s;tance from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>WE have hitherto mentioned the effect of vi&s;ible objects only upon one &s;ingle eye, we need &s;carce repeat the proverb, that two eyes &s;ee better than one. In fact, by means of two we &s;ee more plainly, and are always better prepared,

in ca&s;e of accidents. Opticians generally pre&s;ent us with a figure, by which they &s;hew the method of two eyes &s;eeing the &s;ame body at once (&s;ee fig. 69). In this both eyes are turned inwards, in order to take a view of an object placed at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them; &s;o that they may be thus &s;uppo&s;ed to behold the &s;ame object only as one &s;ingle body. This figure, and the theory al&s;o derived from it, &s;eem to me erroneous. We cannot turn our eyes both inwards or both outwards, un|le&s;s we &s;quint. For in&s;tance, let a per&s;on try to throw both eyes at once on the point of his own no&s;e, he will find him&s;elf utterly incapable of doing it. Nor do we, when turning both eyes towards the &s;ame object, &s;ee it &s;ingle, as this figure would repre&s;ent, but actually double. If we fir&s;t ob&s;erve an object with our right eye, and mind what part of the wain&s;cot it corre&s;ponds with, then let us ob&s;erve it with the left, and it will &s;eem to corre&s;pond with a different part. Then let us ob&s;erve it with both eyes at
<PB N="314" REF="330">
once, and the object will &s;eem in a &s;itu|ation between the two points with which it before corre&s;ponded. Thus we really &s;ee an image of the object to the right, and another to the left; but our judg|ment determines it to be but one image between both. If we pre&s;s the globe of either eye inwards with our finger, we &s;hall make that eye &s;quint; and we &s;hall &s;ee ju&s;t in the manner as a man that &s;quints naturally. But by this pre&s;&s;ure we &s;hall find, that if we turn to any object, we &s;hall &s;ee two images in&s;tead of one; whereas, the man that &s;quints naturally, thinks he only &s;ees one &s;ingle image. Whence comes this difference? The truth is, he &s;ees two images as well as we; but he has long &s;o learned to bethink right, that he forgets he was ever wrong: the mi&s;take is new to us, and therefore the error is obvious.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Method of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Sight by Gla&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every eye is &s;o framed as to be able to &s;ee di&s;tinctly at different di&s;tances rays coming from dif|ferent parts of the object. To &s;ee objects di&s;tinctly, it is requi&s;ite that each ray &s;hould be diffu&s;ed upon the <HI>cornea,</HI> and from thence be converged into a point, which will help to &s;tipple or point out the image of the external object upon the back of the eye. On this union, or pointing of the rays upon the back of the eye, depends di&s;tinct vi&s;ion; for &s;hould they be united before they come there, or &s;hould the point where they would unite, lie far|ther back than the <HI>retina,</HI> it is evident that the ray, from each point of the ex|ternal object, would thus take up too much room in the back of the eye, and mix with that next it, and that with another, and &s;o all the rays would be
<PB N="317" REF="333">
thus mixed and blended together on the back of the eye, exhibiting together a very confu&s;ed repre&s;entation of the ob|ject without.</P>
<P>NOW, the greater the di&s;tance from whence rays come, the more parallel do they fall upon the eye; whence, there|fore, the image of near bodies will not converge in the eye &s;o &s;oon as the di&s;tant ones; when they come from a le&s;s di&s;|tance they are more widely &s;cattered. The eye then mu&s;t have a power of adapting its form to the reception of bodies at different di&s;tances. That is, if it is to receive the image of di&s;tant objects who&s;e rays come parallel and converge quickly, it mu&s;t have a power of bringing the back-part of the eye more forward to meet the focus of the convergent rays. On the contrary, if the object be very near, as the vi&s;ual rays will then converge very far back, the eye mu&s;t have a power of lengthening its orbit, in order to let the rays fall at
<PB N="318" REF="334">
a proper focal di&s;tance on the <HI>retina</HI> be|hind. All this is performed by means of &s;ix mu&s;cles which are in&s;erted into the outward coat of the eye, which, like &s;o many cords or pulleys, lengthen the eye-ball at plea&s;ure. So that by their means, the eye which is globular, is &s;ometimes lengthened nearly into the &s;hape of an egg with the &s;mall end fore|mo&s;t. When the object to be &s;een is very near, the mu&s;cles act together, and lengthen the eye to make a long focal di&s;tance; when the object is remote, the eye re&s;umes its natural form, and the focal points of the di&s;tant rays fall upon the <HI>retina.</HI></P>
<P>YET, notwith&s;tanding this contrivance of Nature to adapt our eyes to different objects at different di&s;tances, there are &s;ome eyes, in which, rays coming from di&s;tant objects, will not find a proper focus, and objects will be therefore con|fu&s;edly &s;een; while there are others where the rays from near objects will,

by falling too far back into the eye, be equally confu&s;ed. For if, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the <HI>cornea,</HI> or cry&s;talline humour of the eye, be very convex, as in the eye B (&s;ee fig. 70) it will refract the rays too &s;oon for di&s;tinct vi&s;ion. For the rays that enter it from the object C, will be converged to a focus much too &s;oon, and before they come to the <HI>retina</HI> at <HI>f.</HI> Per&s;ons thus affected, are &s;aid to be near-&s;ighted, that is, they can &s;ee objects near the eye who&s;e rays enter very divergent, with minute preci&s;ion; but if the objects are removed at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance, they become confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct. If the ball of the eye has been long kept in a lengthened po&s;ition by regard|ing very minute objects, it will, at length, a&s;&s;ume this con&s;trained form, and the per&s;on will become near &s;ighted from the elliptical figure of his eye. Thus we &s;ee &s;everal per&s;ons be|come &s;hort &s;ighted, when the nature of their employments obliges them to be conver&s;ant with the &s;malle&s;t &s;ubjects, as
<PB N="320" REF="337">
miniature painters, virtuo&s;i, and watch|makers. This inconvenience is remedied by u&s;ing a concave gla&s;s, which always cau&s;es the rays to diverge; &s;o that when they are made to fall diverging upon the eye, the focal di&s;tance is removed to the proper place, and is ju&s;t upon the <HI>retina.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other hand, there are eyes that require the u&s;e of convex gla&s;&s;es to make them &s;ee objects di&s;tinctly. For if the <HI>cornea a b c,</HI> or cry&s;talline hu|mour be too flat, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e with the aged, they will not refract the rays &s;o &s;oon, wherefore their focus would fall behind the <HI>retina,</HI> and thus cau&s;e an indi&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion. This infirmity is remedied by u&s;ing a convex gla&s;s, which converges the rays before they come to the eye, and throws them, thus converg|ing, upon the flat <HI>cornea,</HI> which, thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, throws them exactly to the fo|cal di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="338">BUT there are other gla&s;&s;es which we now come to explain. The micro&s;cope, which magnifies &s;mall bodies to &s;uch immen&s;e bulks, is an in&s;trument of in|finite u&s;e to philo&s;ophy, &s;ince by it a new world is opened to the eye, of which mankind before never even &s;u&s;pected the exi&s;tence. Of all tho&s;e who have made micro&s;copical di&s;coveries, Leeuwenhoek de&s;erves the fir&s;t place; his re&s;earches were generally guided by &s;en&s;ible theory, and not diffu&s;ed at random throughout all nature. He made many micro&s;copi|cal di&s;coveries which have been &s;ince found true by repeated ob&s;ervation; he has made others, which we have adopted barely upon his authority; for neither our eyes nor our gla&s;&s;es are capable of arriving at a clear view of their minute|ne&s;s. He left his micro&s;copes to the Royal Society; we have &s;ince made others that magnify many degrees be|yond them; yet for all this, our di&s;|coveries fall &s;hort of his ob&s;ervations. Long habit probably taught him better
<PB N="322" REF="339">
arts of adapting his in&s;truments, and fitted his eye more properly to them. The nearer any body is to the eye, the larger the angle it will be &s;een un|der; but then if placed too near the naked eye, the image will be confu&s;ed and irregular. The micro&s;cope reme|dies this defect; it brings the object clo&s;e to the eye, and yet does not hinder di&s;tinct vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE common &s;ingle micro&s;cope (&s;ee fig. 71) is only a &s;mall and very convex gla&s;s, as <HI>c d.</HI> The object to be magnified is placed at its focal di&s;tance, and the eye is to be at the &s;ame di&s;tance on the other &s;ide. The rays flowing from every point of the object run parallel after refraction, and &s;pread them&s;elves upon the <HI>cornea.</HI> From thence they are converged into as many different points on the <HI>retina,</HI> forming one large di&s;tinct picture. Large, for the object being very near is &s;een at a great angle; di&s;|tinct, for the object's rays fall parallel
<PB N="323" REF="340">
upon the <HI>cornea.</HI> If we would know mathematically, how much a gla&s;s of this kind magnifies the object, geometri|cians &s;hew that we mu&s;t fir&s;t find out the focal di&s;tance of the gla&s;s, that we mu&s;t next try at what di&s;tance we can, with the naked eye, view the &s;ame object di&s;tinctly. Divide this la&s;t di&s;|tance by the former, and the <HI>quotient</HI> will be the body's apparent increa&s;e.</P>
<P>THE double, or compound micro&s;cope (&s;ee fig. 72) con&s;i&s;ts of an object gla&s;s <HI>c d,</HI> and an eye gla&s;s <HI>e f</HI>; the object to be magnified is placed at &s;omething more than the focal di&s;tance, by which means the rays converge after pa&s;&s;ing through it, and form the picture of the object a little before the eye-gla&s;s <HI>e f,</HI> and if it be properly placed, the picture &s;hould be exactly in its focus. The rays diverging from this picture fall upon the eye gla&s;s, where they again &s;uffer refraction and pa&s;s on parallel to the eye, and will then be converged upon the <HI>retina,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="341">
and form a large inverted image A B. The magnifying power of this micro&s;cope is as follows. Suppo&s;e the image <HI>g h</HI> to be &s;ix times the di&s;tance of the object <HI>a b</HI> from the object-gla&s;s <HI>c d,</HI> if &s;o, it will be &s;ix times greater; this image may be &s;een di&s;tinctly, if placed within an inch of the eye-gla&s;s, whereas, the naked eye could not &s;ee it di&s;tinctly but at &s;ix inches di&s;tance; con&s;equently it will be viewed under an angle &s;ix times greater &s;till. So that it is increa&s;ed &s;ix times &s;ix, which make thirty-&s;ix times. Its diameter will be thus magnified; its whole &s;urface will be therefore increa&s;ed by the &s;quare of the diameter, that is 1296 times.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee, by adding one gla&s;s, how much the &s;urface of the minute object is enlarged; a third and a fourth gla&s;s, if added, would magnify it &s;till more; but this addition of new gla&s;&s;es is ab&s;olutely precluded, becau&s;e the more the gla&s;&s;es are increa&s;ed, the more mu&s;t

the light be dimini&s;hed, and the darker will the object appear, till at la&s;t it be in|volved in utter ob&s;curity. Mathematical in&s;trument-makers have contrived various ways of making micro&s;copes, and have given to each a peculiar name. There are catadioptic micro&s;copes, &s;olar micro|&s;copes, reflecting micro&s;copes, and &s;o forth; the de&s;cription of but a part of the&s;e might occupy volumes, and the peru&s;al might be of advantage to mathe|matical in&s;trument makers.</P>
<P>WHATEVER micro&s;copes perform upon minute bodies, very near; tele|&s;copes perform upon great bodies very remote; namely, they enlarge the angle in the eye under which the bodies are &s;een; and thus, by making them very large, they make them appear very near; the only difference is, that in the micro&s;cope, the focus of the gla&s;&s;es is adapted to the in&s;pection of bodies very near; in the tele&s;cope, to &s;uch as are more remote. Suppo&s;e a di&s;tant object
<PB N="326" REF="343">
at A B (&s;ee fig. 73), its rays come nearly parallel, and fall upon the convex gla&s;s <HI>c d</HI>; through this they will converge in points, and form the object E at their focus. But it is u&s;ually &s;o contrived, that this focus is al&s;o the focus of the other convex gla&s;s of the tube. The rays of each pencil, therefore, will now diverge before they &s;trike this gla&s;s, and will go through it parallel; but the pencils all together will cro&s;s in its focus on the other &s;ide, as at <HI>e,</HI> and the pupil of the eye being in this focus, the image will be viewed through the gla&s;s, under the angle <HI>g e h,</HI> &s;o that the object will &s;eem at E under the angle D <HI>e</HI> C. This tele&s;cope inverts the image, and therefore is only proper for viewing &s;uch bodies, as it is immaterial in what po&s;ition they appear, as the &s;un, the fixed &s;tars, &amp;c. By adding two gla&s;&s;es more, the image may be &s;een upright. The magnifying power of this tele|&s;cope is found by dividing the focal di&s;tance of the object gla&s;s, by the focal

The art of u&s;ing the&s;e, or of under&s;tanding their con&s;truction thoroughly, is be&s;t learned from the ar|tificers who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s is to make them. Tele&s;copes have received &s;ome improvements &s;ince the beginning of this century. Tho&s;e they have received from Mr Dollond, a mathematical in|&s;trument-maker, de&s;erve to be men|tioned. By increa&s;ing the number of gla&s;&s;es in the refracting tele&s;cope, he has made an in&s;trument of this kind, but three feet long, magnify the ob|ject as much as an ordinary tele&s;cope of ten. It was long thought, and even demon&s;tration had been brought to prove, that refracting tele&s;copes were
<PB N="328" REF="346">
incapable of farther improvement by the addition of a greater number of gla&s;&s;es. It was &s;aid, that &s;ome rays of light were more refracted in pa&s;&s;ing through gla&s;&s;es than other rays; &s;o that numerous gla&s;&s;es would permit only the lea&s;t refrangible rays to pa&s;s on through them all to the eye; and the&s;e rays which had been thus &s;trong enough to get through, being but few in number, and all of one colour, they would im|print no picture. Dollond, however, di&s;regarding the theory, tried the ex|periment of adding more gla&s;&s;es, and then theori&s;ts began to &s;ay, that light was not &s;o very refrangible. It is remarkable enough, that the members of the acade|my of Peter&s;burgh, propo&s;ed the im|provement of the refracting tele&s;cope to the learned, as a &s;ubject for the year's prize, the very year Dollond made this di&s;covery.

<PB N="330" REF="348">
&s;ize; the&s;e are all wonders that the curious would wi&s;h to under&s;tand, and the inexperienced to examine.</P>
<P>BEFORE Newton expanded nature to our view, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that every ray of light which bodies reflected, re|bounded from their &s;urfaces, as we &s;ee a marble bound when &s;truck upon the pavement. Newton, however, taught mankind, that rays of light never touch the bodies from whence they are re|flected; but that every ray, when it comes within a certain di&s;tance of the body, either pa&s;&s;es entirely through, or is again &s;truck back, as we &s;ee filings of &s;teel when brought near to the load&s;tone. However poli&s;hed the &s;urface of the &s;moothe&s;t object may &s;eem to our &s;ight and touch, yet it is, in fact, one con|tinued a&s;&s;emblage of inequalities. To us the&s;e inequalities appear &s;mall, but if compared with the &s;mallne&s;s of light, they are as mountains. From the &s;ur|face of &s;uch, therefore, it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="331" REF="349">
that rays will be reflected with that uniformity we u&s;ually ob&s;erve; or that we could ever &s;ee an image of our&s;elves completely reflected; for un|equal &s;urfaces mu&s;t make unequal and &s;cattered reflections. "If light," &s;ays Newton, "were reflected by &s;triking on the &s;olid parts of the gla&s;s, it would be &s;cattered as much by the mo&s;t po|li&s;hed gla&s;s as the roughe&s;t." We mu&s;t be obliged to allow, therefore, that it is reflected before it arrives at the &s;urface, and that the whole body, and not any &s;ingle point, drives it back; all the parts oppo&s;e their united repelling power, to meet the incur&s;ive rays, and drive them back with uniformity.</P>
<P>LET us, however, for a &s;hort time, &s;up|po&s;e that every reflected ray &s;trikes again&s;t the body, and rebounds from it to the &s;pectator's eye, like a tennis ball to the racket of a player. Now, whatever was the direction in which the ray &s;truck the body, it will rebound with a contrary
<PB N="332" REF="350">
direction. If I &s;trike an ivory ela&s;tic ball again&s;t the pavement, whatever force I impre&s;&s;ed upon it, it will re&s;tore it&s;elf with a contrary force; and what|ever direction I gave it, it will rebound in a contrary direction. If I &s;trike it perpendicularly down, it will ri&s;e per|pendicularly; if I &s;trike it in an oblique direction, it will mount obliquely the other way. This is nece&s;&s;arily the re&s;ult of its ela&s;tic quality. A ray of light may be con&s;idered as an ela&s;tic body, and whatever be the angle of its inci|dence upon the plain &s;urface, the angle of its reflection will be &s;imilar. The line A C (&s;ee fig. 74) is the line of inci|dence, the line C B is the line of re|flection, and the&s;e form equal angles on the &s;urface of the poli&s;hed mirrour; &s;o that all the rays coming from the object, and falling upon the mirrour at C, will &s;trike the eye at B, and the reflected image will thus become vi&s;ible. But now a difficulty remains. How comes it then, that we do not &s;ee the
<PB N="333" REF="351">
body at C, &s;ince it is there that all its rays fall; and why do we &s;ee it deep within, or behind the mirrour, at D? This is an&s;wered thus; no object can be &s;een that does not lie in a &s;traight line from the eye, or, at lea&s;t, appear to do &s;o. The body A, therefore, when it comes reflected to the eye, will appear to lie in the &s;traight line B D, which, &s;ince the angle of incidence is equal to that of reflection, will be exactly in the two lines A C and A B. The rays, therefore, going from A to C, will be &s;een at D, and con&s;equently, &s;o will the picture. For, as the rays have diverged in going from the object at A A, and diffu&s;ed them&s;elves upon the &s;urface of the gla&s;s, they will be again converged into an equal focus, by the time they ar|rive at D D, and they will therefore paint the object at D D.</P>
<P>FROM hence we may learn, that if a man &s;ees his whole image in a plain looking-gla&s;s, the part of the gla&s;s that
<PB N="334" REF="352">
reflects his image, is but one half as long and one half as broad as the man. For the image is &s;een, under an angle, as large as the life; the reflecting mirrour is ex|actly half-way between the image and the eye, and therefore mu&s;t make but an angle half as large as the image, or in other words, it is ju&s;t half as large as the image which is of the &s;ame &s;ize with the man. Thus the man A B (&s;ee fig. 75) will &s;ee the whole of his own image in the gla&s;s C D, which is but half as large as him&s;elf. His eye, at A, will &s;ee the eye of the image at an equal di&s;tance behind the gla&s;s at E. His foot at B will &s;end its ray to D; this will be reflected at an equal angle, and the ray will therefore go in the di|rection of F D A; &s;o that the man will &s;ee his foot at F. That is, he will &s;ee his whole figure E F. But &s;uppo&s;e his foot was lower than B at L, then he could not &s;ee it; for the ray L &s;triking the gla&s;s at D, would be reflected with an equal angle up to M, far above the man's eye, and
<PB N="335" REF="353">
con&s;equently out of his &s;ight. In the &s;ame manner as he advances or retires, he will &s;till &s;ee his own image, if all the lines of reflection come to his eye; but if they ri&s;e above it; like D M, or fall below it, that part of the object, to him, will be invi&s;ible, though another &s;pectator at M may &s;ee his feet at L, which he him&s;elf cannot &s;ee.</P>
<P>THUS plain mirrours reflect, not only the object, but the di&s;tance al&s;o, and that exactly in its natural dimen&s;ions; but it is otherwi&s;e with regard to convex mir|rours, &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as a watch-ca&s;e, which dimini&s;h; or concave mirrours, which, on the contrary, magnify it. As to convex mirrours, the nearer we ap|proach them, the more the image &s;tarts back; in the ca&s;e of concave, as we draw near them, the image &s;eems to &s;tep for|ward, beyond the gla&s;s, to meet us.</P>
<P>TO &s;how fir&s;t, how images are le&s;&s;ened in the convex mirrour, we mu&s;t &s;till
<PB N="336" REF="354">
repeat the former rule, that the angle of reflection is ever equal to the angle of incidence. Carrying this in our memory, let us &s;uppo&s;e (fig. 76) an object A A is re|flected by a convex gla&s;s, to the eye, at C. Let us con&s;ider, at what angles each pen|cil of rays, from the object, will fall upon this convex &s;urface. It is certain, that each angle which they make with it, will be more acute than if the mirrour's &s;ur|face were perfectly flat. If &s;o, after reflection, the reflected rays being &s;up|po&s;ed to pa&s;s onward to B, they will be converged much &s;ooner from acute, than if they came from large angles; and the object B B will therefore appear more near and &s;maller than the life.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, with regard to concave mirrours, an object mu&s;t appear in them larger than the life, if it be placed moderately near (&s;ee fig. 77). For the pencil of rays B B falling at larger angles upon the concave &s;urface, if they are reflected; they will not con|verge

<P>AS the real principles of catoptrics are perfectly mathematical, and can be known only by tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in deep geometry; it would be vain to attempt leading the reader farther into this &s;ub|ject, as every &s;tep onward would be found to increa&s;e the gloom. The principles of this &s;cience, particularly with regard to the places where objects are &s;een in mirrours, are yet in di&s;pute among ma|thematicians, and hitherto undecided. Newton acknowledges the determina|tion of the apparent place of an object, &s;een in a concave mirrour, to be the mo&s;t difficult part of all mathematics. His words are, <HI>Puncti illius accurata de|terminatio, problema &s;olutu difficillimum praebebit, ni&s;i hypothe&s;i alicui &s;altem veri|&s;imili,

<P>THERE are &s;everal amu&s;ing optical deceptions which are effected by a pro|per combination of plain or convex mir|rours. We all know, that if a man &s;tands with his face oppo&s;ite a looking-gla&s;s, and with his back to another, he will &s;ee his figure many times reflected. If an hexagon chamber, (one with &s;ix &s;ides) be &s;o contrived as to have light admitted, in &s;ufficient abundance, from the top, and a large gla&s;s on every &s;ide, a man &s;tanding in this chamber, will &s;ee him|&s;elf multiplied into a &s;eeming crowd. The effect is &s;till more plea&s;ing by can|dle light.</P>
<P>LET there be a box of &s;ix &s;ides, and divide its in&s;ide by as many little parti|tions running from each corner, which
<PB N="339" REF="358">
will all con&s;equently unite in the middle. Line each partition with looking gla&s;&s;es, and let there be an hole made on every &s;ide of the box to look through. Cover the&s;e holes with plain gla&s;s, and cover the top of the machine, thus prepared, with fine oiled parchment, and the catoptric box is made. Whatever object we place upon the &s;ide or &s;ides, at which we look in, it will be multiplied in the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing manner, and by turning different &s;ides, a variety of pro&s;pects may be thus offered to the view, each &s;eemingly twenty times larger than the capacity of the machine we look through.</P>
<P>IN another box, if we u&s;e a convex gla&s;s, &s;uch as we u&s;ually read with, at a hole on the &s;ide of the box, and place a looking gla&s;s in its focus, in &s;uch a man|ner, that while the focus falls upon the mirrour, the mirrour at the &s;ame time reflects objects or pictures below; this will magnify tho&s;e pictures very much, and place them &s;eemingly at a great

di&s;tance from the eye. The&s;e may a|mu&s;e the youthful; but there have been catoptric in&s;truments formed for the a|mu&s;ement of philo&s;ophers. The re|flecting tele&s;cope is among the number. This in&s;trument was fir&s;t invented by Newton, who &s;aw the inconvenience of u&s;ing very long refracting tele&s;copes, and therefore &s;ub&s;tituted reflectors. He gave directions for making one of &s;ix inches long, which was found to mag|nify objects as much as a common re|fractor of four feet. If any reader de|&s;ires to know the con&s;truction of this in&s;trument, he &s;hall have it from Mr. Fergu&s;on's de&s;cription, which is the plaine&s;t that I have met with.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. Of Colours.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto con&s;idered light as a body uncompounded and of parts re&s;embling each other; but we are now going to examine its texture more clo&s;ely: we &s;hall now &s;ee that this fluid, though &s;o &s;imple to all appearance, is made up of very different particles; that it is compo&s;ed of different coloured tints, and that from the nature of this compo&s;ition ari&s;es that charming variety of &s;hades which paint the face of Nature.</P>
<P>WHATEVER plea&s;ures we derive from the beauty of colouring is owing to the different rays of light alone; for the ob|jects them&s;elves have no difference in this re&s;pect at all: the blu&s;hing beauties of the ro&s;e, or the mode&s;t blue of the violet, are not in the flowers them&s;elves, but in the light that adorns them: odour, &s;oft|ne&s;s,
<PB N="347" REF="366">
and beauty of figure are their own; but it is light alone that dre&s;&s;es them up in tho&s;e robes which &s;hame the monarch's glory. Take away all light and their colour will vani&s;h; let but a portion of light be permitted to &s;hine upon them, and their colours will be changed. But though the colours be in the light, and not in the objects, yet it is in our power to alter them at plea&s;ure; we have only to change the &s;urface of the object, and light in&s;tantly gives it another colouring. Thus in every circum&s;tance we at be&s;t re&s;emble tho&s;e &s;ervants of painters who prepare the frame or &s;tretch the canvas, but it is light alone that always holds the pencil.</P>
<P>THERE is a common experiment, and ea&s;ily performed, to prove that the co|lours are not in the objects them&s;elves, but in the rays of light that fall upon them; and that if the nature of light be altered, the colours al&s;o will receive al|terations: Let a pint of common &s;pirits,
<PB N="348" REF="367">
the cheape&s;t will an&s;wer as well as the be&s;t, a pint of malt &s;pirits then, be poured into a &s;oop-di&s;h, and then &s;et on fire: as it begins to blaze, let the &s;pectators &s;tand round the table, and let one of them throw an handful of &s;alt into the burning &s;pirits, &s;till keeping it &s;tirring with a &s;poon. Let &s;everal handfuls of &s;alt be thus &s;ucce&s;&s;ively thrown in; the &s;pectators will &s;ee each other frightfully changed, their colours being altered into a gha&s;tly blackne&s;s. Were the &s;olar flame of the &s;ame nature with that of this com|po&s;ition, we &s;hould have no other co|lours in nature but &s;uch as tho&s;e produced by the experiment.</P>
<P>NATURALISTS were formerly of opi|nion that the &s;olar light was &s;imple and uniform, without any difference or va|riety in its parts, and that the different colours of objects were made by refrac|tion, reflexion, or &s;hadows. But New|ton taught them the errors of their for|mer opinions; he &s;hewed them to di&s;&s;ect
<PB N="349" REF="368">
a &s;ingle ray of light with the minute&s;t preci&s;ion, and demon&s;trated that every ray was it&s;elf a compo&s;ition of &s;everal rays, all of different colours, each of which when &s;eparate held to its own nature, &s;imple and unchanged by every experiment that could be tried upon it.</P>
<P>TO prove all this, it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to find out a method of &s;plitting a &s;ingle ray of light into the &s;everal rays of which it was compo&s;ed, and this was effected by means of the pri&s;m, or a three &s;quare gla&s;s already de&s;cribed. Let the &s;un &s;hine into a dark room through a &s;mall hole as at <HI>e e</HI> in a window-&s;hutter (See fig. 79.) and place a pri&s;m B C, which we &s;ee endways in the figure, in the beam of rays A, in &s;uch a manner, that the rays may fall obliquely on one of the &s;ides <HI>a b</HI> C of the pri&s;m. We &s;hall then &s;ee the rays that pa&s;s through the pri&s;m &s;truck upon the oppo&s;ite wall, ran|ged one above the other, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. The
<PB N="350" REF="369">
range will be beautiful, and the colours &s;o bright as to exceed the power of art to equal. In this manner then is the &s;olar beam &s;eparated into the colours of which it is in nature compo&s;ed; and one ray con&s;i&s;ts of many rays, each different in its colour, and darting forward from the great luminary with different force. The red ray, for in&s;tance, goes forward more forcibly than any of the re&s;t, and is therefore lea&s;t refracted or bent out of its rectilineal cour&s;e, but falls upon the wall almo&s;t in a &s;traight line at R. In proportion as each &s;ucceeding ray has le&s;s force, it is driven more out of its rectilinear direction, till at the violet it feebly paints it&s;elf upon the highe&s;t part of the picture.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee that in nature the bright|e&s;t colours drive forward from the &s;un with the greate&s;t force; and what we find true by experiment, is confirmed by our &s;en&s;ations. The brighte&s;t colours &s;trike our eyes with the greate&s;t force;
<PB N="351" REF="370">
the red makes &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, the orange is not &s;o forceful; the colours &s;trike us le&s;s vividly in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion till we come to the violet, which approaches very near to black, and gives us a faint idea of darkne&s;s. For this rea&s;on it is, that when the eye is very weak, a &s;carlet colour becomes in&s;upportable, its impre&s;|&s;ions are too powerful, and next to the &s;olar beam it&s;elf, dazzles and di&s;turbs the organ. Surgeons in this ca&s;e generally pre&s;cribe a black object to be placed be|fore the eye, as a piece of black &s;ilk, for in&s;tance; but violet is very near ap|proaching to blackne&s;s, &s;o that that would do almo&s;t as well.</P>
<P>WE now therefore may conclude, that a &s;ingle ray of light, which before &s;epara|tion &s;eemed to be of an uniform white appearance, is compo&s;ed of a bundle of no le&s;s than &s;even different rays, and that when an object reflects them all, it then appears white. On the contrary, if the object &s;ends back no rays to our eye, it
<PB N="352" REF="371">
then appears black, which is nothing more than the privation of all colour. If we could find an object perfectly black, &s;uch a body would be to us perfectly in|vi&s;ible; &s;uch however is not to be found in nature; and painters in drawing black objects are forced to heighten all the ground with white: and it is &s;o in na|ture; the black which we &s;ee is an a&s;&s;em|blage of different colours, and faintly re|flecting rays of almo&s;t every kind. Should it be doubted that white is but the a&s;&s;em|blage of all the colours of the pri&s;m united, numberle&s;s experiments can be ea&s;ily brought to confirm it. The rays, when divided by a pri&s;m, if they be again united by a common convex gla&s;s, will throw a bright &s;pot of white upon the &s;ame paper, where before they &s;epa|rately painted the beautiful pri&s;matic va|riety. If a round board be painted with colours, imitating tho&s;e from the pri&s;m, and if it be then turned &s;wiftly with a circular motion, &s;o as that the eye cannot have time to view any one of the colours
<PB N="353" REF="372">
di&s;tinctly; as it takes in the whole a&s;&s;em|blage together, the figures on the board will reflect every colour, and appear white or nearly approaching to whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE colours, reflected by the pri&s;m, are not only the mo&s;t beautiful in nature, but al&s;o each in it&s;elf continues &s;eparate and unalterable. When one of tho&s;e primitive rays has been &s;eparated from the re&s;t, nothing can change its colour. Send it through another pri&s;m, expo&s;e it in the eye of a burning-gla&s;s, yet &s;till its colour continues unaltered; the red ray will pre&s;erve its crim&s;on, and the violet its purple beauty; whatever object falls under any of them, &s;oon gives up its own colour, though never &s;o vivid, to a&s;&s;ume that of the pri&s;matic ray. Place a thread of &s;carlet &s;ilk under the violet-making ray, the ray continues unaltered, but the &s;ilk in&s;tantly becomes purple. Place an object that is blue under a yel|low ray, the object immediately a&s;&s;umes the radial colour. In &s;hort, no art can
<PB N="354" REF="373">
alter the colour of a &s;eparated ray; it gives its tint to every object, but will a&s;&s;ume none from any; neither reflexion, refraction, nor any other means can make it forego its natural hue; like gold, it may be tried by every experiment, but it will &s;till come forth the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN whatever manner we con&s;ider the colour of a &s;ingle pri&s;matic ray, we &s;hall have new cau&s;e to admire the beauties of nature. Whatever compo&s;itions of co|louring we form, if examined with a micro&s;cope, they will appear a rude heap of different colours unequally mixed. If by joining, for in&s;tance, a blue with a yellow, we make the common green, it will appear to the naked eye moderately beautiful; but when we regard it with micro&s;copic attention, it &s;eems a confu&s;ed ma&s;s of yellow and blue parts, each par|ticle reflecting but one &s;eparate colour: but very different is the colour of a pri&s;|matic ray; no art can make one of equal brightne&s;s, and the more clo&s;ely we exa|mine
<PB N="355" REF="374">
it, the more &s;imple it appears. To magnify the parts of this colour is but to increa&s;e its beauty.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the variety therefore in nature, there are but &s;even original co|lours; violet, indigo, blue, green, yel|low, orange, and red. Of the&s;e &s;imple colours, all the artificial ones, which we &s;ee every in&s;tant, are compo&s;ed, and every object is of this or that colour, as its parts are fitted for reflecting the corre|&s;pondent ray in greater abundance. A red object reflects the red rays mo&s;t co|piou&s;ly, a blue object the blue, green ob|jects reflect the green ray, and &s;o of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT though the colour of an object ari&s;es from its reflecting rays only of one particular colour, yet a number of parts may be &s;o mixed in one object, as to re|flect the rays of almo&s;t every colour in the pri&s;m, as we may ea&s;ily effect by mixing different powders together, tho'
<PB N="356" REF="375">
in this ca&s;e, in reality, the colours are re|flected from a great number of minute objects all of different hues, yet to our naked and undi&s;tingui&s;hing eyes, the whole &s;eems but one uniform &s;urface of colouring. Thus we often call that green, which is in fact a mixture of blue and yellow; we think that orange, which is compo&s;ed of two colours, yellow and red: and thus in general objects of different tints are made to imitate one of the ori|ginal tints, granted by the &s;imple pri&s;|matic ray; but colours, thus compounded, may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;imple ones. That body, which reflects one pri&s;matic colour in greate&s;t abun|dance, has ever the mo&s;t beautiful and the brighte&s;t dye; while, on the contrary, tho&s;e bodies, which reflect &s;everal differ|ent colours, &s;eemingly blended to the eye, ever &s;trike us with le&s;s vivid and le&s;s beautiful impre&s;&s;ions: and indeed, the whole &s;ecret in the painter and dyer's art, is to make their colours as &s;imple as they can; for in proportion as they are mixed,
<PB N="357" REF="376">
they lo&s;e their beauty; for in&s;tance, the &s;imple green pri&s;matic colour is the mo&s;t beautiful imaginable; a green le&s;s beau|tiful is made by an artificial mixture of two colours, blue and yellow; a green, &s;till le&s;s beautiful, may be made by a mix|ture of &s;imple green, orange, and indigo; but the mo&s;t ob&s;cure green of all will be that made by a &s;till greater number of the&s;e colours united. By much compo|&s;ition in this manner, the beauty of every colour may be de&s;troyed, and all its live|line&s;s dimmed into faintne&s;s. Grey, ru&s;|&s;et, brown, are only compo&s;itions of many colours, they may be con&s;idered as &s;o many le&s;&s;er degrees of white, and differ only in having the proportion of their colours le&s;s evenly mixed, and con|&s;equently not affecting us with &s;uch &s;trong &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved in the beginning, that the different colours pa&s;&s;ed through the pri&s;m in different directions. The red, being lea&s;t refracted or bent in its cour&s;e,
<PB N="358" REF="377">
went almo&s;t directly forward; the &s;uc|ceeding colours dimini&s;hed in their force, till the violet was refracted mo&s;t of all, and went through the pri&s;m in a very oblique direction. What can be the cau&s;e of this more direct progre&s;s in one ray than in the other? Why is the violet driven more out of its cour&s;e than the red? Can it be a&s;cribed to any other cau&s;e than the different attractions which the different rays undergo from the medium, or gla&s;&s;y body, through which they pa&s;s? It mu&s;t certainly be &s;o. The red rays are lea&s;t attracted, and therefore drive through mo&s;t directly; the violet are mo&s;t at|tracted, and therefore they go through the mo&s;t oblique of all. We have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t all bodies repel as well as attract; and that when at a certain di&s;tance, the attracting power is too feeble to act, then the re|pul&s;ive power exerts its force, and the bodies are driven &s;eparate. Now what|ever be the attractive force of the pri&s;m upon &s;ome rays of light in &s;ome circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="359" REF="378">
it will have a repul&s;ive force upon the &s;ame rays in other circum|&s;tances, and that ray which it attracted mo&s;t &s;trongly at one time, it will repel with the greate&s;t violence at another. A ray repelled or driven back is only in other words a ray reflected, &s;o that we may &s;ay, that tho&s;e rays, which are mo&s;t &s;trongly refracted, are mo&s;t &s;trongly reflected al&s;o; the attractive power operates at one time and refracts the ray, and the repellent power at another, and reflects it. If this then be the ca&s;e, the violet ray, as it is mo&s;t refracted, will be mo&s;t reflected al&s;o; while on the other hand, the red ray, as being &s;mall in refraction, will be &s;low in reflection; and this is found true by experiment: for if we turn a pri&s;m round upon it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that the light, which was tran&s;mitted through it, be reflected upon an object properly di&s;po&s;ed, we &s;hall &s;ee the violet will be the fir&s;t colour that will &s;uffer reflexion, then each other colour in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, till red comes to clo&s;e up the rear. From hence
<PB N="360" REF="379">
therefore we may conclude, that the &s;ame cau&s;e, which produces the refraction of the rays, produces their reflexion al&s;o. The more we know of Nature, the more we di&s;cover her uniformity.</P>
<P>WE may now then univer&s;ally con|clude, that if colours have not that vari|ety, the uninitiated ob&s;erver would &s;up|po&s;e, that they are but few, beautiful, and &s;imple, yet &s;till enough by their variety to give us all tho&s;e plea&s;ures which a mixture of them is &s;ometimes apt to pro|duce. Colours and &s;ounds have &s;ome|thing in them alike. There are &s;even notes in mu&s;ic, there are &s;o many colours in the pri&s;m. The di&s;tance between each note is a&s;certained, a &s;imilar di|&s;tance is al&s;o found between each coloured ray; but we mu&s;t not from hence &s;up|po&s;e that there is any real re&s;emblance between &s;ounds and colours; the&s;e are merely accidental &s;imilitudes, and their diver&s;ities are &s;till more numerous; each note, for in&s;tance, may be divided into
<PB N="361" REF="380">
many tones; each &s;imple colour is indi|vi&s;ible. The combination of tones &s;ome|times increa&s;es their beauty, on the con|trary, the combination of colours deadens their effect. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds have a very fine influence upon the mind, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of colours has &s;carce any: yet in this philo&s;ophical age, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the trifling re&s;emblance between &s;ounds and colours, as mentioned above, &s;hould pa&s;s without proper no|tice. In fact, a whim&s;ical French philo|&s;opher has written a treati&s;e to prove, that as our ear finds plea&s;ure in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds, &s;o the eye may have a &s;imilar one from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of colours. There is, &s;ays F. Ca&s;tel, a mu&s;ic of co|lours as well as of &s;ounds; and when the eye has been for a &s;hort time le&s;&s;oned to ocular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there will ari&s;e as much plea&s;ure to the eye, as the ear derives from &s;ound. For this purpo&s;e he compo&s;ed an ocular harp&s;ichord, as he called it, which, in&s;tead of &s;ounding to the ear, pre&s;ented colours to the eye: the pri&s;matic rays
<PB N="362" REF="381">
furni&s;hed the notes, and the &s;hades be|tween were &s;ub&s;tituted for the &s;emitones. The inventor however died without fi|ni&s;hing an in&s;trument, which rai&s;ed the expectations of many, but excited the ridicule of more. Sounds furni&s;h the ear with all its plea&s;ure. Colours furni&s;h the eye but with half its plea&s;ures, for figure comes in for the other half. To make &s;uch an in&s;trument &s;atisfy the &s;en&s;e, the beauty of colour and figure mu&s;t be united.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Figure and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Sur|faces of Bodies, to reflect their re&s;pect|ive Colours.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader now perceives the cau&s;e of all colours, and knows that it is light, which, differently coloured it&s;elf, thus dre&s;&s;es them in various beauty. Each object &s;ends back to our eye tho&s;e rays of light, which its &s;urface is be&s;t adapted to reflect. The ruby drinks up every other ray of light, the green, the blue, and the violet, but repels back the reddening rays to our eye in all their pri&s;matic lu&s;tre. The amethy&s;t imbibes the &s;tronger rays, and gives back the violet with milder brightne&s;s. The tulip gives us only the yellow, and the hya|cinth its vivid blue. Every coloured ob|ject may be thus regarded as a partial divider of the rays of light, as a pri&s;m which can only &s;eparate one colour, but confounds all the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="383">IT will be now a &s;ubject entirely cu|rious, to inquire what is the peculiar con|formation of tho&s;e bodies, which thus reflect one &s;ort of rays and no other; to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e why the ruby reflects nothing but the red rays, and the hya|cinth only blue.</P>
<P>WE have hitherto only ob&s;erved the colouring &s;ub&s;tance it&s;elf, we ought now to con&s;ider the preparation of the ground which receives it: to inquire how it comes that every object hath this &s;epa|rative power over the particles of light; how it imbibes one colour, while it co|piou&s;ly reflects another?</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on in general, why bodies re|flect this or that kind of ray more copi|ou&s;ly than any other, and con&s;equently a&s;|&s;ume one particular colour, is, that the &s;ize and den&s;ity of the parts, of which bodies are compo&s;ed, are different. Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e the &s;urfaces of all the objects around us compo&s;ed of an infinite
<PB N="365" REF="384">
number of &s;mall gla&s;&s;y plates, let us &s;up|po&s;e too the plates of one &s;urface &s;ome|thing thicker than the plates of another; let us &s;till farther &s;uppo&s;e, that a beam of light, with all its &s;even rays, &s;trikes again&s;t one of the&s;e little thin plates, what will be the con&s;equence? This plate will in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble a &s;hield: if it be extremely thin, it will be unable to repel the &s;tronge&s;t darting rays. The red, the orange, the yellow, the green, the blue, and the indigo rays will all dart through it with unre&s;i&s;ted force; the feeble violet ray alone will be unable to get entrance, and will therefore be reflected back to our eye, and we &s;hall &s;ee the whole object, if it be compo&s;ed of &s;imilar plates, of a beautiful violet co|lour, while all the other rays have pa&s;&s;ed into the &s;ub&s;tance of the body, and are there &s;tifled and lo&s;t. Suppo&s;e the plate again&s;t which the &s;even rays are darted to be a little thicker, the indigo then will be repelled and reflected, and the object will appear of that colour; thus, as the
<PB N="366" REF="385">
plates increa&s;e in thickne&s;s, the colour will approach to redne&s;s, for the thicke&s;t plates of all will reflect only that colour; thus therefore the colours of bodies will depend upon the different thickne&s;s of the plates, of which their &s;ub&s;tance is compo&s;ed. The thinner the plates, the body will be more inclining to violet; on the contrary, the thicker they are, it will then approach more nearly to redne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT we have here &s;uppo&s;ed two things, which mu&s;t be fir&s;t proved. We have &s;aid that bodies are compo&s;ed of &s;mall tran&s;parent plates, and we have a&s;&s;erted al&s;o that the thinner the plate, the more approaching to violet will be the colour. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is obviou&s;ly true, the parts of all bodies, though &s;eemingly void of tran&s;parency, when viewed in the gro&s;s, will be found, if taken &s;eparately, to be pellucid like gla&s;s. Nothing can &s;eem|ingly be more opake and free from tran&s;|parency than the clothes we wear, yet let us but examine any one of the woollen
<PB N="367" REF="386">
hairs that go into their compo&s;ition with a micro&s;cope, and it will be found nearly tran&s;parent. Gold in the ma&s;s lets no light through it, but if beaten out ex|tremely thin, we &s;hall then &s;ee that its parts are tran&s;parent like other bodies, and it will ca&s;t a greeni&s;h light if put over a hole in a darkened window; &s;o that if gold be compo&s;ed of tran&s;parent parts, we may &s;afely conclude the &s;ame of all other bodies whatever.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd a&s;&s;ertion, that the thinner the plates, the more inclining to violet or to black it&s;elf, would be the colour of the body which they compo&s;ed, comes next in view. This, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible to be proved, for where &s;hall we find plates &s;ufficiently thin to determine this, or how can we mea&s;ure them when found? Newton, the mo&s;t fertile of all philo&s;ophers in expedients to confirm his theory, threw light upon the intricacy by a very obvious, though till then unregarded experiment. The bubbles
<PB N="368" REF="387">
which children blow with a mixture of &s;oap and water, or the froth that we often &s;ee &s;tanding upon the &s;urface of a wa&s;hing-tub, appeared to him capable of being turned to philo&s;ophical purpo&s;es; things overlooked by the re&s;t of mankind are often the mo&s;t fertile in &s;ugge&s;ting hints. He blew up a large bubble from a &s;trong mixture of &s;oap and water, and &s;et him&s;elf attentively to con&s;ider the dif|ferent changes of colour it underwent from its enlargement to its di&s;&s;olution. He in general perceived that the thinner the plate of water which compo&s;ed the &s;ides of the bubble, the more it reflected the violet-coloured ray; and that in pro|portion as the &s;ides of the bubble were more thick and den&s;e, the more they re|flected the red; he therefore was induced to believe, that the colours of all bodies proceeded from the thickne&s;s and den&s;ity of all the little tran&s;parent plates of which they are compo&s;ed: but this was only conjecture; to bring the theory to greater certainty, it was nece&s;&s;ary to mea&s;ure the
<PB N="369" REF="388">
thickne&s;s of the plate of water which compo&s;ed the bubble; but this was at|tended with &s;ome difficulty, for the bubble was it&s;elf of too tran&s;ient a nature to admit of any experiments upon it. He now bethought him&s;elf therefore, that two gla&s;s plates might be made to ap|proach &s;o very clo&s;e to each other, that if water were put between them, it could be pre&s;&s;ed as thin as might be thought pro|per. For this purpo&s;e therefore, a gla&s;s, a very little convex, was placed upon a plain gla&s;s, by which means they touched only in the middle, while all the other parts were almo&s;t, but not quite touching, &s;o that water, or even common air, being placed between them, was pre&s;&s;ed to the greate&s;t conceivable degree of minutene&s;s. As the convexity of one of the gla&s;&s;es was known, their di&s;tance from each other at every point could be ea&s;ily mea&s;ured, and thus the thickne&s;s of the plate of water between them, at any di&s;tance from the center, where the gla&s;&s;es touched, might be de|termined
<PB N="370" REF="389">
with the mo&s;t exact preci&s;ion. When the&s;e gla&s;&s;es then were thus pre&s;&s;ed together, the water or air between exhi|bited the following appearances: In the middle point, where they touch, appeared a black &s;pot perfectly tran&s;parent, next to this a ring of blue, then of white, yel|low, orange, red; then a new order of the &s;ame colours begins again, and &s;oon, one coloured ring without the other, for &s;ix or &s;even different repetitions of orders &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, each outer circle however more ob&s;cure than tho&s;e within, like the circular waves upon a di&s;turbed &s;heet of water. In all the orders, however, it ap|pears that the reds are reflected by the plates of greate&s;t thickne&s;s, and the vio|lets by the thinne&s;t.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that the colours in the&s;e rings are by no means &s;imple, but made up of two or three, and &s;ometimes four of the &s;imple pri&s;matic colours united together; and from hence therefore we may infer, that
<PB N="371" REF="390">
all the objects of nature may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have their tints compounded. Like the&s;e coloured rings, each object around us partakes of &s;everal &s;imple colours blended into one compo&s;ition, and by knowing the &s;imple colours that go into the compo&s;ition of a &s;ingle ring, we may nearly conjecture the &s;imple colours, that go into the compo&s;ition of objects of ex|actly &s;imilar colours, with which we are ordinarily conver&s;ant. Thus, for in&s;tance, if we turn our eyes to the azure blue of the &s;kies, and demand what are the &s;imple colours that go into its compo&s;ition, we have only to examine the different orders of blue in the variou&s;ly coloured rings of this plea&s;ing experiment: among the number, we find a beautiful faint blue of the fir&s;t order, exactly re&s;embling the colour of the &s;erene &s;ky: nor does it only re&s;emble this blue in colour, but in nature al&s;o. The colour of the heavens mu&s;t ari&s;e from the nearly tran&s;parent vapours that float within its bo&s;om ex|ce&s;&s;ively &s;mall, and their parts of almo&s;t
<PB N="372" REF="391">
inconceivable thinne&s;s; the blue co|loured ring is reflected by a plate as thin as can well be imagined, being nearly an hundred thou&s;and times thinner than the cry&s;tal of a watch. In this manner we may find the &s;imple pri&s;matic tints in every other object. The beautiful green of the fields exactly re&s;embles a fine green in one of the coloured rings of the third order. This colour is compounded of three &s;imple tints, blue, yellow, and green, and re&s;embles the natural verdure of the fields in more than one circum|&s;tance; for as the vegetables wither, they grow yellow, and thus di&s;cover the colours which originally went into the compo&s;ition of their natural beauty; in &s;hort, there is &s;carce a colour in nature, that we &s;hall not find &s;ome &s;hade in the&s;e coloured rings bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to; and univer&s;ally, the le&s;s compounded every colour, and the more it approaches pri&s;matic &s;implicity, the more vivid its appearance, and the more inten&s;e its ray.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="392">LET us again therefore repeat with un&s;atiated plea&s;ure tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;|qui&s;itions into nature. Every object takes its colour from the rays of light, which its parts are mo&s;t fitted to reflect. The &s;mall con&s;tituent parts of every ob|ject are in them&s;elves tran&s;parent, and while they &s;uffer &s;ome rays to pa&s;s, they reflect others. If the parts were ex|tremely &s;mall, and compo&s;ed of plates as thin as the &s;ides of a bubble ju&s;t going to break, their colour would be of the vio|let kind; if the parts were thicker, they would a&s;&s;ume &s;tronger colours through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hades up to red. Nature however pre&s;ents us with no object, who&s;e colour is &s;imple and reflects only the light of a &s;ingle coloured ray. The &s;kies, the fields, the flowers, the emerald, and the ruby all have their tints from a com|po&s;ition of &s;imple colouring, each mo&s;t beautiful the nearer it approaches &s;impli|city.</P>
<P>THUS far of the cau&s;e of colour and the &s;ize in the parts of bodies to reflect
<PB N="374" REF="393">
it; but &s;till a difficulty remains: How comes it that &s;ome bodies are tran&s;parent, while others of the &s;ame colour are per|fectly dark, and let no rays of light pa&s;s through them? How is it that the ruby may be &s;een through, while a piece of &s;ealing-wax is perfectly opake? How comes it that the emerald lets the green ray, which falls upon one of its &s;ides, dart through to the other, while the leaf of a plant lets no light pa&s;s through at all? In order to &s;olve this que&s;tion, it may be proper to a&s;k another: If the ruby or the emerald were taken and ground into a powder, what would be the con&s;e|quence? the con&s;equence would cer|tainly be, that neither would any longer be tran&s;parent, nor &s;uffer the light to pa&s;s through them. The ruby thus pow|dered and made up into a pa&s;te, would be as opake as the &s;ealing-wax it&s;elf. The rea&s;on of this difference then will now be obvious: While the ruby was in its jewel &s;tate, its pores were &s;mall, and the plates of which it was compo&s;ed lay evenly &s;urface over &s;urface, like one gla&s;s
<PB N="375" REF="394">
plate laid upon another. The light therefore falling upon this even &s;olid &s;ur|face was attracted through without hin|drance, and but few of its rays were driven back, or &s;uffered reflection by the way; but it mu&s;t be very different with the &s;ame body when reduced to powder; it then becomes porous, its &s;urfaces lie confu&s;ed and in unequal directions. A part of the rays of light therefore will fall upon the outward broken particles of the gem, and by being reflected to the eye, give us, as in the former ca&s;e, a &s;en&s;ation of redne&s;s; but far the greater number of rays will pa&s;s into its &s;ub|&s;tance, they will upon entrance find it porous, the conden&s;ed matter which in the former ca&s;e attracted it, and increa&s;ed the rays celerity, now no longer acts with equal force, the ray feebly attracted therefore will be partly repelled, will dart from pore to pore, will be driven into ten thou&s;and directions, and will be at la&s;t totally lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e. In a word, the tran&s;parency of all bodies ari&s;es from
<PB N="376" REF="395">
the clo&s;ene&s;s and &s;imilitude in the con|texture of their parts, while their opa|city on the contrary ari&s;es from their being very porous, or from being com|po&s;ed of parts very di&s;&s;imilar to each other. The ruby was deprived of its tran&s;parency by being ground to a coar&s;e powder, a degree of tran&s;parence might again be re&s;tored by grinding the&s;e coar&s;e parts &s;o as to make them extremely fine, and thus re&s;tore them in &s;ome mea&s;ure to their original minutene&s;s. And in this manner &s;ome of tho&s;e tran&s;parent bo|dies, called pa&s;te, are formed by repeated trituration. We may conclude therefore that to make almo&s;t any body tran&s;pa|rent, little more is requi&s;ite than to di|mini&s;h the pores. Paper tran&s;mits but little light; it becomes more tran&s;parent by &s;topping up its inter&s;tices with oil.</P>
<P>AS the parts of bodies mu&s;t thus be clo&s;e and &s;imilar when they are tran&s;pa|rent, on the other hand, if they reflect light, this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come from
<PB N="377" REF="396">
their pores. The ray, which is attracted by the &s;olid parts of the body, is repelled when it comes to a pore; for wherever attraction cea&s;es, there repul&s;ion begins. Thus, when the rays of light pa&s;s from air into gla&s;s, ju&s;t at their entrance into this new medium, &s;ome of them mu&s;t meet pores, from which they will partly be re|pelled, and yet a part will enter, and &s;o there is a &s;mall reflection from the nearer &s;urface of the gla&s;s. As the rays go for|ward, by coming to the back &s;urface of the gla&s;s, and going again out into air, they will meet with a greater number of pores than they fir&s;t did upon their en|trance into the gla&s;s, and there will be therefore more rays reflected from the back &s;urface than from the nearer; and if the rays, in&s;tead of going out from the back &s;urface into air, went into a void, which has &s;till more pores than air, they would meet &s;till more oppo&s;ition to repel their progre&s;s, and they would be re|flected in greater abundance. What is thus true in theory, is equally proved by
<PB N="378" REF="397">
experience; for if we cover the mouth of a receiver with a gla&s;s properly di&s;|po&s;ed, then we &s;hall &s;ee, as the air is pumped from behind, the rays will begin to be reflected from the hinder &s;urface in a very copious manner.</P>
<P>IN this manner is light reflected from the pores of all bodies; but it may be objected, that we formerly a&s;&s;erted that the den&s;e&s;t and thicke&s;t plates are tho&s;e which reflect the mo&s;t numerous rays, whereas we now &s;ay, that the pores re|flect the rays only; does not this imply a contradiction? Not at all; for we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that a ray of light is ever mo&s;t reflected when it pa&s;&s;es between two me|diums, which have the greate&s;t difference in their den&s;ities: for in&s;tance; it is mo&s;t reflected when it pa&s;&s;es from a very rare medium, like air, into a very den&s;e one, like quick&s;ilver. It is repelled from the pores of the latter in great abund|ance; for quick&s;ilver, though den&s;e, hath numberle&s;s pores notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="398">THIS then brings us to the la&s;t &s;tep of our theory. We &s;aid long &s;ince, that bodies which were very white reflected all manner of rays. Tin is &s;uch a body. We now &s;ay that the den&s;e&s;t bodies are mo&s;t apt to reflect rays coming from a rarer medium. Quick&s;ilver has great den&s;ity; a mixture of tin and quick&s;ilver, therefore is made u&s;e of to reflect the rays in a common mirrour. A tran&s;pa|rent gla&s;s plate is fixed before to prevent any injury being offered to &s;o &s;oft a &s;ub|&s;tance as the two metals united make; a part of the rays enter the pores of the gla&s;s, they go through, meet a medium of different den&s;ity, part are reflected from its pores to our eyes, and part go to be lo&s;t irrecoverably in the bo&s;om of the metal.</P>

If now &s;ome drops of a lie of pot-a&s;h be poured in; as the affinity be|tween the aqua-fortis and pot-a&s;h is greater than between aqua-fortis and vi|triol, the aqua-fortis will de&s;ert the vi|triol and cling to the pot-a&s;h. It drags it down to the bottom, as it before did the vitriol, while in the mean time the vi|triol being &s;et free, again mixes with the gall-water, and thus the fluid a&s;&s;umes its former blackne&s;s.

<P>IT only now remains to account for that difference of colour which the &s;ame

object frequently exhibits in different &s;ituations: thus, the colour of a dove's neck in one po&s;ition is green, and in another, purple. The plumage in a pea|cock's tail now appears red, then a daz|zling green. Some &s;ilks, looked at di|rectly, are purple, &s;idewi&s;e, they are red. Some liquors, as an infu&s;ion of lignum ne|phriticum, held between us and the light, &s;eems blue, but oppo&s;ite the light &s;eems red or yellow. Whence comes this dif|ference? It ari&s;es from a difference of den&s;ity in the &s;mall plates of which tho&s;e bodies are compo&s;ed. In one po&s;ition, &s;ome are adapted to reflect the rays, while others to ab&s;orb and tran&s;mit them; for if we &s;uppo&s;e one of the&s;e double-coloured objects to be made up of two &s;ub&s;tances of very different den&s;ities, for in&s;tance, the particles of the body it|&s;elf to be one &s;ub&s;tance, and the fluid that enters between them another, the reflections from the&s;e parts of very dif|ferent den&s;ities mu&s;t be very different at different obliquities of the eye.

<P>YET perhaps all this may be ac|counted for on much more obvious prin|ciples. The &s;mall plates of colour in one po&s;ition are turned to the eye, in another, they are turned away, and a different &s;urface pre&s;ented to the &s;pectator.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Rainbow.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the meteors which re&s;ult from the reflection of light, the rainbow is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and extraordinary: its colours not only delight the eye with the mildne&s;s of their lu&s;tre, but encou|rage the &s;pectator with the pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding &s;erenity.</P>
<P>IT is but by &s;low and painful &s;teps we arrive at the true cau&s;es of things: the colours of the rainbow, which &s;truck antiquity with amazement, no longer now create the philo&s;opher's &s;urpri&s;e. To Pliny and Plutarch it appeared as an object which we might admire, but could never explain. The prie&s;ts always pre|ferred the wood on which the rainbow had appeared to re&s;t, for the burning their &s;acrifices, vainly &s;uppo&s;ing that this wood
<PB N="389" REF="408">
had a perfume peculiarly agreeable to their deities. Some philo&s;ophers of the ob&s;cure ages began to form more ju&s;t conceptions concerning this meteor; but Kepler it was, who fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed that it might ari&s;e from the refraction of the &s;un's rays upon entering the rain-drops. Antonio de Dominis enlarged a theory but ju&s;t hinted at by Kepler; and his treati&s;e <HI>De radiis lucis et iride</HI> appeared in the year 1611, &s;everal years after the author him&s;elf had been driven from his bi&s;hoprick of Spalatro in Dalmatia by the Inqui&s;ition, for attempting to oppo&s;e the opinions of Ari&s;totle, which were then clo&s;ely connected with religion, or at lea&s;t thought to be &s;o. Each &s;ucceeding philo&s;opher went on in improving a the|ory, the truth of which &s;eemed to carry great probability. Carte&s;ius and Mari|otte both &s;et them&s;elves to improve the inquiry, but as they were ignorant of the true cau&s;es of colour, they left the ta&s;k unfini&s;hed, for Newton to complete. The theory of the rainbow, as explained by
<PB N="390" REF="409">
him, is full, clear, and impre&s;&s;es the mind with perfect conviction. Of all the various meteors which &s;erve to terrify or amu&s;e us, this is the only one, for which naturali&s;ts can account in a &s;ati&s;|factory manner.</P>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to de&s;cribe this meteor, which every reader mu&s;t have &s;urveyed with wonder. The mo&s;t untutored &s;pec|tator knows, that it is only &s;een when he turns his back to the &s;un, and when it rains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Its colours are, beginning from the under part, vio|let, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, &s;o that we &s;ee it contains all the beautiful and &s;imple &s;hades of the pri&s;m. Without the fir&s;t bow, we often &s;ee an external rainbow, with colours le&s;s vivid, and ranged in an oppo&s;ite order, begin|ning from the under part, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet; &s;ome|times we &s;ee half, &s;ometimes an whole bow, frequently one, very often two, nay, three have been &s;een; Dr. Halley
<PB N="391" REF="410">
gives an account of his having ob&s;erved &s;uch a triple bow at Che&s;ter, and many others have &s;een the &s;ame. Now then, to explain the manner in which the bow is made, and the cau&s;e of the&s;e various appearances, which it is found to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>LET us begin this theory with the ex|periment by which Antonio de Dominis undertook to explain the cau&s;e of the rainbow: this philo&s;opher filled a gla&s;s globe with water, and hung it at a cer|tain height, oppo&s;ite the &s;un, then &s;tand|ing him&s;elf with his back to the &s;un and his face to the globe, he found, that when this was placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as that a ray darting from the &s;un to the globe made angle, with another ray going from his eye to the globe, of forty-two degrees three minutes, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, I &s;ay, he found that the globe appeared red. If the globe was altered, &s;o as to make the angle between the &s;olar and the vi&s;ual ray le&s;s, then the other colours of the rainbow aro&s;e, from red down to
<PB N="392" REF="411">
violet, which appeared at an angle of forty degrees &s;eventeen minutes. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in this philo&s;o|pher's place, the globe before us, the &s;un behind, and its rays again&s;t the globe making an angle with our vi&s;ual ray of forty-two degrees three minutes: we know that millions of the &s;un's rays fall upon this globe, and that each ray has a different colour, and is differently re|fracted upon entering the globe, the red ray being lea&s;t refracted, and the violet ray mo&s;t of all. For this rea&s;on, the red rays will pa&s;s out of the globe in one place, the orange rays in another, the yellow, the green, the blue, the indigo, and the violet will all pa&s;s &s;eparately. To make this &s;till plainer, let us &s;uppo&s;e this globe an a&s;&s;emblage of an infinite number of plain &s;urfaces, which it is in effect. (See fig. 80.) Let us &s;uppo&s;e the red rays, A B C to come parallel from the &s;un upon three minute &s;urfaces of the globe, now we know that each will be refracted or bent in pa&s;&s;ing into the globe

proportionally to its angle of incidence. The red ray A falls with the mo&s;t oblique incidence, and its refraction will be there|fore greater than that of the ray B or C, &s;o that it will be bent to R. The ray B comes with a le&s;s oblique incidence, and there|fore it will be refracted more directly to the &s;ame point R; the ray C inciding &s;till le&s;s obliquely than either, will be le&s;s refracted, it will go almo&s;t directly for|ward to R; thus the three rays, by fall|ing at different angles of incidence, will unite in the &s;ame place at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe. At the point R each ray will be in a great mea&s;ure reflected, making an angle of reflection perfectly equal to the angle of incidence; from R, therefore, each ray will travel backward out of the globe, and upon emerging from thence at <HI>a b c,</HI> they will make the &s;ame angle with the &s;urface of the globe as that by which they fir&s;t entered, they will therefore all turn out parallel as they fir&s;t came from the &s;un, and they will &s;trike the &s;pectator's eye, if it hap|pens

The rays <HI>a b c</HI> are the vi&s;ible ones of the globe or drop of water, and every drop of water has thus its vi&s;ible rays. There are numberle&s;s others which do not come to the eye; there are millions of orange, blue, green, violet ones, which &s;triking upon the &s;ame part of the globe with the red rays, that are differently refracted upon going through, and take a different road upon being reflected back, &s;o as not to fall upon the eye placed at <HI>o.</HI> Were the globe lowered a little, and the angle thus made &s;maller, reduced to forty degrees &s;eventeen minutes, then the violet rays would &s;trike upon our eye, while the red rays we &s;aw before would pa&s;s over our heads, and a &s;pectator who looked over us would &s;ee them.</P>
<P>NOW, what has here been &s;aid of one globe or drop of water is true of millions
<PB N="395" REF="415">
of drops. Let us imagine a &s;hower fall|ing at &s;ome di&s;tance before us, and the &s;un from behind us darting its rays upon the numberle&s;s drops of which it is com|po&s;ed. Let us, to avoid confu&s;ion, &s;up|po&s;e we &s;ee a rainbow of three orders of colours; the drop R, that is &s;een at the large&s;t angle, L O R, will be red, the drop &s;een at a &s;maller angle, L O V, will be green, and that &s;een at a &s;till &s;maller angle L O P will be violet. (&s;ee fig. 81.) Thus, millions of drops will be &s;een of tho&s;e three different colours: in &s;hort, all drops in that &s;hower, &s;een at the &s;ame angles will appear variou&s;ly coloured in that manner: all drops, I &s;ay again, that are placed between &s;uch angles, that is, of forty-two degrees and forty, will be &s;een coloured, and if &s;o, we mu&s;t thus &s;ee part of a beautiful circle of the&s;e co|lours; for we may readily &s;uppo&s;e an arch in the heavens, every part of which &s;hall be at an angle of between forty and forty-three degrees from the eye, and this arch is the rainbow. Our eye is in the point of a cone, and the rays that
<PB N="396" REF="416">
dart from it, falling at tho&s;e angles, form the circular ba&s;e of the cone: a part of this circle we &s;ee coloured, while the earth cuts off the other part which lies below our horizon.</P>
<P>TO make this yet plainer; &s;uppo&s;e the &s;pectator were upon the top of a very high mountain, and the drops of rain falling near him, in&s;tead of a &s;emicircu|lar rainbow, he would then actually &s;ee a complete ring of that beautiful meteor. All drops at an angle of between forty and forty-two degrees will appear to him coloured. One drop may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be at that angle above the &s;pectator's eye, another at the &s;ame angle downwards below his eye, one drop at that angle to the right, and another to the left; in &s;hort, we may thus complete a circle of drops, and this is that glorious circle which he &s;ees, a circle not like our com|mon bow, cut off by the earth, but com|pletely beautiful, and u&s;ually &s;een from the American Andes.</P>

<P><PB N="397" REF="418">WE come now to the &s;econd rainbow, which we ob&s;erved encompa&s;&s;ed the for|mer, more widely &s;pread, more faintly lu|minous, and with inverted colouring. This bow, like the former, is made by the rays of the &s;un darting upon the drops of falling rain, and from thence reflected to the &s;pectator's eye. The dif|ference between the two bows is this, that in the internal bow each drop re|ceives the rays of the &s;un on its upper &s;urface, (&s;ee fig. 82.) whereas, on the contrary, in the great external bow, each drop receives the &s;un's rays at its bottom, from whence the ray being twice re|fracted and twice reflected, it comes to the &s;pectator's eye with dimini&s;hed lu&s;tre and in an inverted order. But before we explain this, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as in the former bow experience proved that the drop mu&s;t be placed at angles of between forty and forty-two degrees to tran&s;mit and reflect the coloured ray, &s;o experience likewi&s;e proves, in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, that the drop mu&s;t be placed at
<PB N="398" REF="419">
an angle of between fifty degrees fifty-&s;even minutes, and fifty-four degrees &s;even minutes, to appear coloured after two refractions and two reflections, which we &s;hall now &s;ee a ray, pa&s;&s;ing through it, undergoes.</P>
<P>A BUNDLE of rays dart from the &s;un on the lower &s;urface of the drop at G; (&s;ee fig. 83.) there a part of the&s;e enter, while another part is &s;truck back by re|flection, and lo&s;t: thus there is already part of the rays &s;cattered and lo&s;t to the eye. The part refracted go on to H, a part of the&s;e go forward into air, and are thus lo&s;t again to the eye, while the little that remains is reflected up to K. Here a third time another part of the ray e&s;capes out of the drop, while what re|mains is refracted to M; at its going out of the drop here, &s;till another part of the ray is &s;cattered and lo&s;t, which is a fourth diminution; la&s;tly, what re|mains after &s;o many diminutions is re|flected to the eye at N. Thus the ray
<PB N="399" REF="420">
comes to the eye after no le&s;s than two reflections and two refractions; by this means, therefore, it lo&s;es near one half more lu&s;tre than is &s;een in the inner bow, where there is but one reflection only; and the colours al&s;o of this bow mu&s;t come to the eye in a different order from tho&s;e of the inner bow; for the eye being placed at O, (&s;ee fig. 84.) it receives the lea&s;t refracted red rays from the outer edge of the internal bow, and it mu&s;t therefore receive the mo&s;t refracted or violet rays from the inner edge of the external bow, the violet ray <HI>b</HI> being much more refracted than the red ray <HI>a,</HI> as we &s;ee by the figure.</P>
<P>SUCH is the nature of this meteor formed by the &s;olar rays; but there is &s;ometimes al&s;o a lunar rainbow, formed exactly in the &s;ame manner, by the bright beams of the moon &s;triking upon the bo&s;om of a &s;hower. This meteor Ari|&s;totle boa&s;ts him&s;elf to have fir&s;t re|marked, and a&s;&s;ures us, that in his time
<PB N="400" REF="421">
&s;uch a rainbow was &s;een, with the colours extremely lucid. Similar meteors have been frequently ob&s;erved &s;ince his time; and, among our own countrymen, Mr. Thore&s;by has given the de&s;cription of one in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions. The lunar rainbow which he ob&s;erved was equally admirable both for the beauty and the &s;plendor of its colours: it la&s;ted ten minutes, till at length a cloud came and intercepted the view.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t take e&s;pecial care not to confound this appearance cau&s;ed by the moon, with that lucid ring which we often &s;ee diffu&s;ed round it, called an Halo, for the production of which philo&s;ophy has as yet found no probable &s;olution. Huy|gens &s;uppo&s;es that there are certain glo|bules in the atmo&s;phere, con&s;i&s;ting of a tran&s;parent &s;hell of ice or water, but per|fectly opake within; and that from the partial reflections of the&s;e ari&s;es this me|teor. This can give us but very little &s;atisfaction in our re&s;earch. An infinite
<PB N="401" REF="422">
number of drops with icy coats and opake kernels is a greater wonder than the Halo it&s;elf; we mu&s;t therefore leave this meteor, with &s;ome others, &s;uch as the Parhelia, or mock-&s;uns, the Para|&s;elenae, or mock-moons, which &s;o often appear in the regions round the north pole, quite unaccounted for. No illu&s;|trations are better than fal&s;e illu&s;trations. The rainbow is the only meteor for which we can clearly account; and it is thus, that while philo&s;ophy excites man's pride on one hand, it generally &s;erves to mortify his pre&s;umption on another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of adventitious Colours.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto con&s;idered colour as it is in the light, and as every object is peculiarly adapted for &s;eparating its different rays: we mu&s;t now ob&s;erve, that there are often colours in the eye it&s;elf, which alter the tints of objects contrary to our de&s;ire; we often &s;ee things peculiarly tinctured, when we know their colour to be different from what it appears. To a jaundiced per|&s;on, white objects &s;eem yellow; for the humours of his eye are then actually tinged with that colour. To a per&s;on in a fever, the &s;ame objects appear red, from &s;ome &s;imilar alteration: thus, a change in the organ ever makes a &s;eeming change in the object, &s;o that we may now a&s;&s;ert, that the colour is properly neither in the object, nor in the colouring ray, but in
<PB N="403" REF="424">
the mind, which perceives either. If the eyes of all men were naturally jaun|diced, all white objects would appear uniformly yellow.</P>
<P>A QUESTION of a very intricate na|ture now therefore ari&s;es. Do all men &s;ee the &s;ame objects of the &s;ame colour? Do tho&s;e fields which &s;trike me with an idea of green, pre&s;ent a &s;imilar green to the friend with whom I am walking? we both, it is true, con&s;pire to call that beautiful verdure by one name, yet may it not affect him with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation which I receive from red, or any other colour? To make this plainer, &s;uppo&s;e his eye were jaundiced from the birth, then it is evident that green would ap|pear to him yellow; yet though we are &s;ure he &s;aw the colour wrong, yet this would cau&s;e no error either in his own ideas, or his conver&s;ation; for he would &s;till continue to call that yellow colour green, and we &s;hould under&s;tand him very readily. If a great part of mankind
<PB N="404" REF="425">
had their eyes thus tinctured, each would &s;ee objects different from his fellow, yet none would be &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;take. I &s;ay then again, May not different men have different ideas of the &s;ame colour? I am apt to think their ideas are different. If two men look at the &s;ame &s;hining &s;pot of red upon a white wall for &s;ome time &s;teadily, the colour will &s;eem to alter to each, and new colours will ari&s;e. The&s;e adventitious colours, however, which the &s;pot &s;eems to a&s;&s;ume, are different to dif|ferent per&s;ons: the &s;pot turns to blue in my eye, while it becomes green to the eye of another &s;pectator that ob&s;erves it with me. Now, if we had both origi|nally &s;een the red &s;pot of the &s;ame colour, we &s;hould &s;ee the changes it underwent of the &s;ame colour al&s;o; for if two things are exactly alike, &s;imilar operations upon them will produce &s;imilar effects. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, two different effects, two different colours are produced to each &s;pectator from ob&s;erving the &s;ame object, a proof that the cau&s;e which produced
<PB N="405" REF="426">
this difference mu&s;t al&s;o be double, or that the red &s;pot excited two different ideas originally.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, the theory of ad|ventitious colours, or colours which ari&s;e when the organ is inten&s;ely exerted, is a new and a plea&s;ing &s;ubject: it was fir&s;t &s;tarted by Dr. Jurin, whom more than once we have had occa&s;ion to mention with re&s;pect. It was pur&s;ued by Mon&s;. Buffon, and he has given the hi&s;tory of his particular &s;en&s;ations in this pur&s;uit very accurately; every &s;pectator may readily compare them with his own, and thus di&s;cover how far his organs of vi&s;ion re&s;emble tho&s;e of others. I have tried the experiment with regard to my&s;elf, and have found the colours change to my view in a very different order from that in which they appeared to the French naturali&s;t; the changes as &s;een by him are thus related:</P>
<P>WHEN a red &s;pot upon a white ground is earne&s;tly regarded for &s;ome time, a
<PB N="406" REF="427">
kind of green bordering is ob&s;erved round the &s;pot, and if the eye be taken off from the &s;pot, and thrown upon another part of the wall or ground, it &s;till continues to &s;ee a green bordering as before, ap|proaching a little towards blue.</P>
<P>IF, &s;ays he, we ob&s;erve fixedly and for a long time a yellow &s;pot upon a white ground, we &s;ee the &s;pot at length begin to be bordered with a pale blue, and if we avert our eyes towards another part of the white ground, we &s;hall di|&s;tinctly &s;ee a blue &s;pot of the &s;ize and figure of the yellow one ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>IF we ob&s;erve &s;tedfa&s;tly and for a long time a green &s;pot upon a white ground, we &s;hall &s;ee a bordering of lighti&s;h purple, and in averting the eye, we &s;hall &s;ee a purple &s;pot of the dimen&s;ions of the former.</P>
<P>IF we ob&s;erve in the &s;ame manner a blue &s;pot upon the &s;ame ground, we &s;hall &s;ee a bordering of white inclining to red|ne&s;s,
<PB N="407" REF="428">
and averting our eyes, we &s;hall &s;ee a &s;pot of a light red.</P>
<P>IF we ob&s;erve attentively a black &s;pot upon a white ground, we &s;hall &s;ee a bor|dering of bright white, and turning to another part of the wall, we &s;hall &s;ee a &s;pot of exactly the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with the former of a whitene&s;s far exceeding that of the wall.</P>
<P>IF we ob&s;erve long and attentively a &s;quare &s;pot of bright red upon a white ground, we &s;hall fir&s;t begin to &s;ee the &s;light green bordering mentioned above; continuing to look with fixed attention, we &s;hall &s;ee the middle of the &s;quare be|gin to be di&s;coloured, and the &s;ides a&s;&s;ume a deeper red, and forming a &s;quare of a dark crim&s;on; then retiring a little back|wards, &s;till keeping our eye fixed, we &s;hall &s;ee the crim&s;on edge or &s;quare cro&s;s the &s;pot, and appear in the manner of a &s;a&s;h-window with four panes of gla&s;s, the cro&s;s bars in this little &s;quare being as vi&s;ibly different as the wood from the
<PB N="408" REF="429">
gla&s;s in the window; continuing &s;till to look &s;tedfa&s;tly and with per&s;everance, this cro&s;s changes again, and we &s;ee only a right angle of a red, &s;o &s;trong and pene|trating, that it entirely dazzles the eye, and the organ becomes incapable of bear|ing further fatigue. If now the eye be turned upon another part of the white wall, the right angle will &s;till appear, but no longer red, but of a bright and luminous green. This impre&s;&s;ion re|mains a long time, its colours fade away &s;lowly, and even remain after the eye is &s;hut.</P>
<P>WHAT thus is effected by regarding the red &s;pot, will al&s;o be the con&s;equence of our regarding a yellow, a green, a blue, or black &s;pot, the cro&s;s and the right angle will &s;ucce&s;&s;ively appear each of a colour which is peculiarly adventitious to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>AFTER looking at the &s;un as long as the eye could bear, the image of this lu|minary was &s;o &s;trongly imprinted, that
<PB N="409" REF="430">
it mixed it&s;elf with every object that was viewed for &s;ome time after, in a manner re&s;embling what has been already related.</P>
<P>SUCH is the hi&s;tory of Mon&s;. Buffon. It now remains to be ob&s;erved, that in whatever manner it may in general de|&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations of &s;ome eyes, it cer|tainly does not agree with the changes which are wrought in all. The experi|ment is ea&s;y; and every &s;pectator may be &s;oon convinced, that the adventitious co|lours here de&s;cribed will not be exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e deduced from his own experience. What then can we gather from this inquiry? Only this, That co|lour is in the organ, not in the body &s;een: that man often makes colours without an object: that adventitious colours are not the &s;ame to every eye; and as the&s;e ari&s;e different, &s;o it is very probable that the original colours, which are the &s;ources from whence the others proceed, are al&s;o different: in other words, that the &s;en|&s;ations which different men have from the &s;ame coloured object are as much di|ver&s;ified
<PB N="410" REF="431">
as the organs that view them; and that not the things but the names are all that we can argue upon with cer|tainty.</P>
<P>IT is a conclu&s;ion &s;ufficient to mortify rea&s;oning pride, that the more minutely we penetrate into nature, the more we find cau&s;e to di&s;tru&s;t our guide it&s;elf: that the deeper &s;cience is pur&s;ued, the more it &s;erves to di&s;enchant tho&s;e plea&s;ing delu&s;ions which it&s;elf had before taught us to fancy. A minute inve&s;tigation of nature &s;till pre&s;ents new wonders, till at la&s;t, the philo&s;opher &s;eeing the number ri&s;e upon him on every &s;ide, each equally amazing and equally in&s;crutable, he at length lo&s;es curio&s;ity in de&s;pair, and won|ders at nothing: yet let us while we live &s;trive to be amu&s;ed and to amu&s;e each other. If our happine&s;s hereafter is to con&s;i&s;t in knowing much, let us here, by our feeble anticipation at lea&s;t, &s;hew a pa&s;&s;ion for the enjoyment of &s;cientific felicity.</P>
