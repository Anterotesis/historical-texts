<P>PERHAPS there never was brought together, in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, in any language, a more co|pious collection of rational entertainment, than will be met with in the following &s;heets. To trace the progre&s;s of the di&s;coveries that have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been made in pa&s;&s;ing round the globe, mu&s;t fill the reader's mind with &s;uch a variety of new objects, as cannot fail to rai&s;e his wonder, and entertain him with infi|nite delight.</P>
<P>He will, in this work, be &s;afely conducted through regions that were once thought inacce&s;&s;ible, and be made acquainted with countries altogether different from that in which he dwells.

<P>The variety of incidents that happened in the cour&s;e of the&s;e Voyages, when they come to be hi&s;torically recited, unencumbered with the jargon of &s;ea-phra&s;es, will afford a fund of entertainment, &s;eldom to be met with in the productions of the pre&s;s. The many &s;in|gular adventures, unfore&s;een dangers, and providential e&s;capes, that every &s;hip experienced in pa&s;&s;ing round the globe, can only be conceived by tho&s;e who read, and be|lieved by tho&s;e who have &s;een the wonders of the deep.</P>
<P>Nothing can excite or gratify curio&s;ity more than re|lations of marvellous events that happen in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in circum&s;tances equally critical and important.

The &s;tory of the black, who, with his two compa|nions, peri&s;hed on the mountains of <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> is no le&s;s affecting than that of the murder of the poor Indians, who &s;et the Endeavour at defiance, and bravely oppo&s;ed the landing of the crew.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PREVIOUS to our entering upon the de|tail of the di&s;coveries and adventures of the Engli&s;h navigators who have &s;urrounded the globe, it may, perhaps, afford &s;ome entertain|ment to the curious reader, to be made ac|quainted with the fir&s;t &s;teps that led to &s;o bold an undertaking, and with the characters of tho&s;e happy geniu&s;es, who not only conceived the plan, but contributed not a little by their example to facilitate the execution.</P>
<P>We are told that the &s;hadow &s;een in the moon in the time of her eclip&s;e, fir&s;t pointed out to the early navigators the true figure of the earth; and that, from this &s;imple ob&s;erva|tion, Columbus, by revolving it in his mind, deduced the po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing round its &s;ur|face, or, to &s;peak with more preci&s;ion, of &s;ail|ing from one &s;ide of the continent to the other; for as yet one great continent, and one great ocean, with their appendages, were thought to compo&s;e the whole material world.</P>
<P>Full of this idea, he was naturally led to con|clude, that, by &s;ailing in a direct cour&s;e from any given point of land on one &s;ide, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity arrive at another point of land in the &s;ame parallel on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, provided his
<PB N="ii" REF="16">
provi&s;ions were proportioned to the voyage, and no accident from tempe&s;ts or &s;hipwreck inter|vened to interrupt his progre&s;s. It was on this obvious principle that Columbus founded the cer|tainty of his di&s;covery; the infallibility of which &s;erved to &s;upport his hopes, when ab&s;olute de&s;|pair had &s;eized the greate&s;t part of his followers.</P>
<P>It is true, that, though the figure of the earth was in effect conceived, yet its dimen&s;ions were wholly unknown: but as the road over-land to the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of the continent was no &s;ecret, Columbus was per&s;uaded that a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea by a we&s;tern cour&s;e, if no intermediate lands prevented, would a&s;&s;uredly bring him to the &s;ame coa&s;ts. From his knowledge, there|fore, of the po&s;ition of tho&s;e countries, from whence the rich productions of the Ea&s;t were circulated through all the kingdoms of the We&s;t, he was led to &s;teer, fir&s;t, a &s;outh-we&s;t, and then a direct we&s;t cour&s;e, which brought him among tho&s;e broken fragments of the we&s;tern continent, which he at fir&s;t mi&s;took for the i&s;lands of the Indian Ocean, and to the riche&s;t of which he imagined another voyage would certainly open a pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery being once made, the principle upon which it was grounded could no longer be concealed. Tho&s;e belonging to the naval de|partment about the Court of Spain, who had been mo&s;t violent in oppo&s;ing the undertaking, as appearing to them in no better light than as

the vi&s;ionary conceit of &s;ome crack brained pro|jector, now a&s;&s;umed another tone, and affected to &s;peak of it as a di&s;covery that required no extraordinary talents to accompli&s;h; that it was not the re&s;ult of &s;cience, but a thing that mu&s;t follow of cour&s;e to the fir&s;t adventurer; and that it was fortunate for Columbus that he could prevail upon their Maje&s;ties to furni&s;h the means to undertake it, as with &s;uch encouragemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> there were not wanting officers in the royal navy much better qualified to have conducted the enterprize, tho' by his unparalleled a&s;&s;urance he had obtained the preference. In this &s;light and contemptuous manner it was the humour at court to &s;peak of the new di&s;covery; and though Columbus, after his return, was for a while care&s;&s;ed by the Royal Family, yet the frequent repetition of the&s;e indignities could not fail in time to le&s;&s;en the idea of the merit of a man who had no advocate to &s;upport his credit but the evidence of his own &s;uperior abi|lities. At a court-entertainment, however, to which he was invited, an incident happened that contributed not a little to heighten his character, and mortify his enemies. The conver&s;ation at table turned, as was u&s;ual, upon the importance of the new di&s;coveries; and though all &s;eemed to agree, that the advantages would be immen&s;e that mu&s;t inevitably re&s;ult to Spain, yet little they thought was due to the fir&s;t di&s;coverer, becau&s;e any ordinary &s;eaman, by keeping his &s;hip's head to the we&s;tward, mu&s;t have fallen in

with the &s;ame countries. Columbus, without &s;eeming to regard their di&s;cour&s;e, when dinner was over, and the table uncovered, called for an egg, and twirling it about with his hand, as if by way of amu&s;ement, a&s;ked if any of the company could make that egg &s;tand upon its little end without additional &s;upport. The company, after trying their &s;kill, pronounced <HI>the thing im|po&s;&s;ible</HI>; when Columbus, taking it again in his hand, and brui&s;ing the &s;hell a little at bottom with his nail, produced it upon the table &s;tand|ing upright. The company all fell a-laughing, and one cried out, that any fool could do as much as that. I doubt not, replied Columbus, but any of you may do it, now you have &s;een it done; and &s;o may any mi&s;erable pilot in the navy &s;ail to the Indies, now that I have pointed out the track; but till the i&s;&s;ue had &s;hewn it practicable, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the naval gen|tlemen, that, too, you pronounced an <HI>impo&s;&s;ible thing.</HI> The King and his royal con&s;ort, parti|cularly the latter, were highly plea&s;ed when they were told this &s;tory, admiring the promptne&s;s of a mind whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h, ever collected, neither malice nor envy could di&s;concert.</P>
<P>Other navigators equally enterprizing, tho' le&s;s &s;agacious, were now inflamed with the de|&s;ire of immortalizing their names by new under|takings; &s;o that it is no wonder that the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of di&s;covery went rapidly on for a &s;ucceed|ing century.</P>
<P>It was in 1492 that Columbus made his fir&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="19">
expedition to the Bahama I&s;lands; and in 1496, John Cabbot, in the &s;ervice of England, di&s;co|vered the continent of North America.</P>
<P>Columbus, in his fir&s;t voyage, had not yet conceived the idea of a double continent, but believed, as we have already noted, that he had di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to tho&s;e i&s;lands in the Ea&s;t that were already known by the name of the Ea&s;t Indies; in conformity to which he gave to the i&s;lands that he di&s;covered the appellation of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which they retain to this day.</P>
<P>In 1493, having made a &s;econd voyage, and carried his di&s;coveries con&s;iderably farther to the South, it is &s;aid, he received &s;ome faint notions of a &s;ea beyond a great land, by which the i&s;lands he had fir&s;t di&s;covered were bounded; but it was not till after his third voyage in 1497, that he attained a &s;ight of that continent which Cabbot had di&s;covered the year before.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem, from what has ju&s;t been &s;aid, that the ea&s;tern pa&s;&s;age to the Indian Ocean had been di&s;covered by the Portugue&s;e; and that the Ea&s;t Indies were known to that people be|fore this we&s;tern di&s;covery by Columbus: but, though &s;everal journies by land had been made, with a view to the opening an advantageous commerce with the ea&s;tern countries, by Portu|gue&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors well in&s;tructed in the Ara|bian language, by who&s;e addre&s;s &s;ome progre&s;s had been made in that bu&s;ine&s;s, yet it was not till 1495 that Bartholomew Diaz doubled the Cape of Good Hope, nor till the year 1497
<PB N="vi" REF="20">
(the &s;ame year that the American continent was di&s;covered by Cabbot), that Don Va&s;quez de Gama, by &s;teering the neare&s;t cour&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the Cape, which Diaz had di&s;covered, and &s;ailed into the Indian Ocean, where he afterwards made con&s;iderable conque&s;ts, and by his pru|dent management very &s;uddenly diverted the current of Indian commerce into an entire new channel. The notion, therefore, that Columbus borrowed his idea of a we&s;tern pa&s;&s;age from the di&s;coveries made by the Portugue&s;e towards the Ea&s;t, is ill founded. The&s;e la&s;t had, indeed, made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in their di&s;coveries by land; but the pa&s;&s;ages to the Ea&s;tern and We&s;|tern Indies by &s;ea were di&s;covered about the &s;ame time, without the lea&s;t connection or intelligence between the re&s;pective di&s;coverers. And here we cannot help entering our prote&s;t again&s;t the honour a&s;cribed to Columbus by Mr. Campbell, and other judicious naval hi&s;torians, as being the fir&s;t circumnavigator, becau&s;e, as Mr. Camp|bell ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was his [Columbus's] opinion, that there was a pa&s;&s;age from the North Sea into the South, and from thence it might be very po&s;&s;ible to &s;ail to the Ea&s;t Indies."&mdash;</Q>That it was the opinion of Columbus, that there was a we&s;tern pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies is rea|dily granted; it was his original idea: but that there was a pa&s;&s;age from the Ea&s;t Indies to Eu|rope, without returning the &s;ame way he went, he could have no conception of, till after the pa&s;&s;age by the Cape of Good Hope was di&s;co|vered
<PB N="vii" REF="21">
by the Portugue&s;e. Had he dreamt of an ea&s;tern pa&s;&s;age <HI>by &s;ea</HI> to the Ea&s;t Indies, he would mo&s;t certainly have preferred it to a we&s;|tern pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e it might have been per|formed without lo&s;ing &s;ight of land; and there|fore, with much le&s;s ri&s;que than by launching into an immen&s;e unknown ocean, of which no one could tell the extent. But his notion was, that the earth, like a bowl, inclo&s;ed the &s;ea, and that it could only be traver&s;ed from &s;ide to &s;ide by water, and then from &s;hore to &s;hore by land. Many irrefragable proofs of his having no con|ception of <HI>&s;ailing</HI> round the globe might be ad|duced; but that of his returning the &s;ame way back a &s;econd time, without his <HI>knowing</HI> for cer|tainty, or <HI>believing</HI> there was any other &s;ea to &s;ail upon, or having even determined the extent of that &s;ea on which he had already ventured &s;o far, may &s;erve without farther proof to convince the intelligent reader, that Columbus had never thought of but one &s;ea when he undertook his di&s;covery, and that that &s;ea was only to be cro&s;&s;ed from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed:&mdash;Soon after the ea&s;tern pa&s;|&s;age to the Indies was laid open, the coa&s;t of Brazil, oppo&s;ite to the Cape of Good Hope, was di&s;covered by Cabral, a Portugue&s;e pilot, who was driven out of his cour&s;e by &s;tre&s;s of weather. The &s;ame coa&s;t was likewi&s;e di&s;co|vered the &s;ame year by Yannez Pin&ccedil;on, who commanded a carvel that accompanied Colum|bus in his fir&s;t expedition to the We&s;t Indies. This man conte&s;ted the honour of the fir&s;t di&s;|covery
<PB N="viii" REF="22">
with Columbus, and in&s;i&s;ted that it was through his per&s;everance alone that land was de|&s;cried, the crew of Columbus having ab&s;olutely determined to &s;teer back before the di&s;covery took place. Be that as it may, this able mariner afterwards examined the coa&s;t from the Bay of Mexico to the Equinoctial Line, and, in the year 1500, di&s;covered the great river of Ama|zons, which it was thought would have opened a pa&s;&s;age to the South Sea.</P>
<P>In 1502, Columbus made his fourth and la&s;t expedition, when he fully &s;atisfied him&s;elf, that the i&s;lands he had di&s;covered were totally di&s;|connected from tho&s;e he went in que&s;t of, and that another continent exi&s;ted be&s;ides that which was known to Europeans. He was &s;till, how|ever, of opinion, that a we&s;tern pa&s;&s;age to the old continent from the new would be practi|cable, whenever a way was found to the Great Sea by which it was &s;urrounded: and now it is not at all improbable but that he might fortel what afterwards came to pa&s;s, that one day or other the whole globe might be circumnavigat|ed, though he did not live to &s;ee it executed.</P>
<P>In 1509, the Portugue&s;e fir&s;t found the way to Sumatra, and from thence extended their di&s;co|veries to the Moluccas.</P>
<P>About this time a conte&s;t aro&s;e between the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, concerning the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing countries, to which neither of them had any other claim than that of being the fir&s;t Europeans who happened to land upon their coa&s;ts: a claim of the &s;ame kind his Otaheitean
<PB N="ix" REF="23">
Maje&s;ty may pretend to the we&s;tern part of Eu|rope, his &s;ubject Aotourou being the fir&s;t Tro|pical inhabitant from the S. Sea that ever &s;et foot on that continent. This conte&s;t, however, the Pope took upon him to decide; and, to prevent the bloody con&s;equences that might en&s;ue be|tween two &s;uch powerful competitors, he pub|li&s;hed a bull, which, at that time of blind obe|dience, was held deci&s;ive, decreeing, that what|ever di&s;coveries were made to the we&s;tward &s;hould belong to Spain, and &s;uch as were made to the ea&s;tward, to Portugal. This &s;eemed for a while to content both parties; but, in 1520, Ferdinand Magellan, or Magellhanes, as Mr. Dalrymple affects to call him, having made his famous di&s;covery to the Molucca I&s;lands by a new pa&s;&s;age, the conte&s;t was again revived, and the competitors claimed a &s;econd time the Pope's interpo&s;ition to &s;ettle the limits of their re&s;pec|tive claims by more preci&s;e and determinate boundaries. The claims of the Spaniards were now extended to near three parts of the globe; and tho&s;e of the Portugue&s;e, which by a fal&s;e repre&s;entation had been much dimini&s;hed, were now to be re&s;tored, or rather regulated by a more exact &s;tandard. The two contending powers were to divide the globe between them, by what was then &s;tiled a line of demarkacion. This <HI>line</HI> was to cut the globe into two hemi|&s;pheres, and was to be acknowledged a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> me|ridian: all the di&s;coveries in the we&s;tern hemi|&s;phere were to belong to Spain; and all in the
<PB N="x" REF="24">
ea&s;tern to Portugal. But &s;till there aro&s;e a di&s;|pute about the preci&s;e &s;pot where this meridian line &s;hould be fixed. By the Pope's bull it had been placed 100 leagues to the we&s;tward of St. Antonio, one of the i&s;lands of Cape Verde; but, by this new regulation, it was removed 270 leagues farther to the we&s;t. This altera|tion was intended to deprive Portugal of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Moluccas; but the Portugue&s;e pilots were not to be thus deceived: they &s;uf|fered the line of demarkacion to be fixed; but, when it was finally determined, they in&s;i&s;ted on their right to the Moluccas, as &s;till within their limits, and future ob&s;ervations have &s;ince con|firmed their claims. But, notwith&s;tanding the ju&s;tice of their claims (if ju&s;tice can at all be admitted to exi&s;t in ca&s;es of u&s;urpation), the Spaniards held the Moluccas till 1529, when the Portugue&s;e purcha&s;ed an exclu&s;ive right of trading to them by a loan of 350,000 ducats.&mdash;But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that the coa&s;t of Brazil, and the river of Amazons, was fir&s;t di&s;co|vered by Yannez Pin&ccedil;on, in 1500; but it was not till twelve years afterwards that John de Solis di&s;covered the river Plate.</P>
<P>In 1513, Va&s;co Nunez de Bilboa got &s;ight of the Great South Sea, from the mountains of Pancas in the province of Panama; and from that time Ferdinand Magellan, a Portugue&s;e officer, conceived the de&s;ign of &s;urrounding the globe, by finding a pa&s;&s;age by which he might
<PB N="xi" REF="25">
enter that &s;ea. He now began to con&s;ider the earth as divided into two continents, with their concomitant &s;eas; and, as a promontory was found, by the doubling of which one con|tinent might be vi&s;ited on both &s;ides, he made no doubt but that another promontory exi&s;ted, by which the other might be vi&s;ited in like man|ner. Perhaps the idea of a &s;trait might not at fir&s;t &s;trike his mind, till the opening at Cape Virgin &s;ugge&s;ted it. His original thought was to coa&s;t along to the &s;outhward, as the land trended; and by per&s;everance, he per&s;uad|ed him&s;elf, that a boundary would be found, by which the land of the new continent would be terminated, though he did not, nor could not then a&s;certain to what height it might reach. He had in view a nearer way to the Moluccas than that by the Cape of Good Hope; and he at fir&s;t imparted his views to the Mini&s;ters of his Court, who, probably &s;u&s;pecting that by &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age the right to the Moluccas might be brought in que&s;tion by Spain, treated his project with a contemptuous neglect. To a man full of the importance of &s;uch a di&s;covery, nothing could be more mortifying. He deter|mined, &s;ince he was &s;o coolly received at home, to try his fortune abroad. For this purpo&s;e he repaired to the court of Spain, where, after making him&s;elf known to the leading Mini&s;ter, he undertook to prove the Moluccas, and other rich i&s;lands then reputed in the Ea&s;t, to be within the Spani&s;h line of demarkacion to the
<PB N="xii" REF="26">
We&s;t, and by a new pa&s;&s;age to them he engag|ed to confirm the truth of what he advanced inconte&s;tibly.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions, after being properly exa|mined, and approved by the able&s;t a&s;tronomers and geographers at that time in Spain, was ea|gerly embraced by the Emperor Charles the Fifth, an enterprizing Prince, who then held the kingdom, and who gave him audience in the council-chamber at Sarago&s;&s;a, and conferred upon him, and his companion Ruy Falero, the order of St. Jago, both of whom his Imperial Maje&s;ty honoured with the title of <HI>his Captains.</HI></P>
<P>This encouragement, and the&s;e honours, could not fail to alarm the Court of Portugal: but all the intere&s;t and oppo&s;ition which Alvaro de Aca&s;to, the Portugue&s;e Amba&s;&s;ador, could make, had no effect; the preparations for the voyage were pro&s;ecuted with more than ordi|nary diligence, and five &s;hips were &s;oon got in readine&s;s to put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>But, previous to their &s;etting &s;ail, a difference <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> concerning the nece&s;&s;ary forms of com|mons, which had well nigh ruined the voyage before it was undertaken; the honour of carry|ing the royal &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ndard was conte&s;ted by Ruy Falero, and &s;ome other indignities were offered to Magellan on account of his country. The&s;e, however, were redre&s;&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of the imperial authority; Ruy Falero was per|&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pend his departure on account of his health, and Magellan was declared General
<PB N="xiii" REF="27">
of the &s;quadron, which was now committed to his &s;ole direction.</P>
<P>On the 10th of Augu&s;t, 1519, this little fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of the Admiral's &s;hip; the St. Anto|nio, Capt. Juan de Cartagena, Vice-Admiral; the Victoria, Capt. Luys de Mendo&ccedil;a, Rear-Admiral; the St. Jago, Capt. Juan Rodriguez Serrano; and the Conception, of which Ga&s;per de Quezada was Ma&s;ter; left Cadiz, and pro|ceeded to Teneriff, from whence they took their departure, on the 2d of September, and on the 13th of December arrived at Rio de Janeiro, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, where they &s;taid till the 27th; and, after being plentifully &s;up|plied with all nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments at a very moderate price, they weighed anchor, and con|tinued their voyage, in the cour&s;e of which much di&s;content aro&s;e concerning the track they were to &s;teer; but on Ea&s;ter evening they entered St. Julian river, and were next day or|dered on &s;hore by the General to hear ma&s;s. Three of the Captains refu&s;ed to obey; namely, Luys de Mendo&ccedil;a, Ga&s;per de Quezada, and Juan de Cartagena, this la&s;t being already in arre&s;t for di&s;re&s;pect to his General.</P>
<P>Their di&s;obedience put Magellan on his guard. He perceived that the majority both of officers and men were aver&s;e to the under|taking, and that a general murmuring prevailed throughout the whole &s;quadron. Only a few tru&s;ty friends were ready to &s;upport their Ge|neral, and willing to follow wherever he &s;hould
<PB N="xiv" REF="28">
lead. The weather was now &s;et in very &s;evere, and the Spaniards, unu&s;ed to the rigour of &s;uch a climate, were hardly to be re&s;trained. They re|pre&s;ented the inutility of proceeding, as they were already in a climate too boi&s;terous and inclement to be navigated by Spaniards; that it could never be the Emperor's intention to &s;a|crifice the lives of his &s;ubjects, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of advantage to the State; and that now it was manife&s;t, though the di&s;covery were certain, the navigation would be impracticable, and therefore u&s;ele&s;s. To the&s;e repre&s;entations and others more full of a&s;perity, Magellan coolly made an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was determined to die rather than return back; that he &s;hould pa&s;s the winter where he then was; and that neither provi&s;ions nor wine &s;hould be want|ing to tho&s;e who would be contented with a moderate allowance; but that if any per&s;i&s;ted, in &s;preading di&s;contents, and encouraging di&s;|obedience, he knew how to puni&s;h as well as to reward."</Q></P>
<P>Barros &s;ays, that the three Captains <HI>Carto|gena, Quezada,</HI> and <HI>Mendo&ccedil;a,</HI> con&s;pired together to kill Magellan, and to return and make their report of the u&s;age they had met with, and the hard&s;hips they had endured in the voyage; but Magellan, con&s;idering the danger, and that in certain circum&s;tances <HI>temerity</HI> is better than <HI>cau|tion,</HI> ordered the people of his own &s;hip to arms; and, manning his boat with thirty tru&s;ty friends, he clapt the Victoria aboard; and while Men|do&ccedil;a
<PB N="xv" REF="29">
was reading a letter directed to him from the General, the me&s;&s;enger that delivered it &s;tabbed him to the heart.&mdash;The moment the order was executed, the thirty men entered to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and quietly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip. This done a council of war was called, and a con&s;piracy was detected, in which more than forty of the principal peo|ple on board the &s;everal &s;hips were found to be deeply concerned; but Magellan, that he might not appear too &s;anguinary or vindictive, &s;en|tenced <HI>Quezada</HI> only to be executed, and <HI>Car|tagena</HI> to be left on &s;hore, accompanied by a French Prie&s;t; a puni&s;hment that probably was wor&s;e than immediate death, as it &s;ubjected the criminals to hard&s;hips, which in&s;tant execution would have prevented. Mendo&ccedil;a and Quezada, he ordered to be quartered as traitors, to &s;trike the di&s;affected with the greater terror. This put an end to all oppo&s;ition for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When the winter months drew towards a con|clu&s;ion, Magellan was vigilant to ha&s;ten the departure of his fleet; and, as &s;oon as the cold abated, he di&s;patched Serrano to coa&s;t along the &s;hore to make ob&s;ervations. Serrano, at about twenty leagues di&s;tance, found a river a league broad at the entrance, which he named St. Cruz, becau&s;e he fell in with it on that Saint's day. In examining this river, and in fi&s;hing for &s;eals, he &s;pent &s;ix days, at the end of which a furious &s;torm aro&s;e, which &s;plit his &s;ails, and drove his &s;hip on &s;hore, where &s;he bulged, and was beaten
<PB N="xvi" REF="30">
to pieces. The crew, however, were &s;aved, but reduced to the la&s;t extremity for want of food. Two of the company undertook to travel over land, to give the General notice of the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of their fellow-&s;ufferers; and, after 11 days fatigue, they at length &s;urmounted every difficulty, and accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e. Ma|gellan, pitying their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;ent a ve&s;&s;el with provi&s;ions, which came &s;ea&s;onably to their relief.</P>
<P>The time for &s;ailing being now come, and the &s;hips in readine&s;s, they left the bay of St. Julian on the 24th of Augu&s;t, 1520, after &s;etting Juan de Cartagena, and Pedro Sanchez de Re|vora, the Prie&s;t, who was al&s;o found deep in the plot, a&s;hore on that de&s;olate coa&s;t. They &s;up|plied them plentifully with bread and wine; but as they were never afterwards heard of, there can be no doubt of their peri&s;hing mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>The &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting now of four &s;hips, kept coa&s;ting along to the &s;outhward, with immi|nent danger of &s;hipwreck, till towards the latter end of October, when they fell in with a pro|montory, which the General named Cape Vir|gin, becau&s;e it was di&s;covered on St. Ur&s;ula's-day. This Cape opened an inlet, which Ma|gellan judged favourable to his de&s;ign. He ca&s;t anchor at the entrance of the inlet, and or|dered two &s;hips to examine its cour&s;e. In five days the&s;e &s;hips returned, and one of them affirmed it was a &s;trait, becau&s;e the flood was greater than the ebb; the other reported that
<PB N="xvii" REF="31">
they &s;aw nothing but inlets and breakers. The General, on the&s;e different relations, determined to &s;ail into the opening, in order to be more preci&s;ely informed. He accordingly weighed, and came to an anchor in a commodious bay, where he fir&s;t &s;ent his &s;kiff with 10 men to re|connoitre the &s;hore, and then the St. Antonio to trace out the inlet to a certain di&s;tance. When the men returned from the &s;hore, they &s;aid, they had found a burying-place with more than 200 graves, and had &s;een the &s;keleton of a whale in a cove upon the beach, but had &s;een neither hou&s;e nor inhabitant. The Captain of the St. Antonio on his return gave a more flat|tering account. He &s;aid, he had followed the inlet for more than 50 leagues; that its cour&s;e was due ea&s;t and we&s;t; and that he made not the lea&s;t doubt but that it was the pa&s;&s;age &s;o much de&s;ired. This news was received with repeated acclamations. A council was called of the chief officers and pilots, in which a very warm debate aro&s;e, whether, in the circum&s;tances the &s;hips were then in, it were better to return to Spain, having obtained the main object of the voyage, or to proceed to complete what the General had undertaken to perform, name|ly, to trace out a we&s;tern pa&s;&s;age to the Molucca I&s;lands. E&s;tevan Gomez, the pilot of the St. Antonio, a man of excellent parts and &s;ound judgment, in&s;i&s;ted on returning back, and bringing another &s;quadron to complete the di&s;|covery, alledging, that they had &s;till a great
<PB N="xviii" REF="32">

His opinion was &s;upported by the whole council, Magellan only excepted, who declared, that, if he were &s;ure to be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of eating the hides that covered the yards, he would per&s;evere in the di&s;covery. He accordingly gave orders for weighing an|chor immediately; and, proceeding down the &s;trait, &s;ent the Antonio to examine &s;ome inlets that promi&s;ed a nearer pa&s;&s;age to the main ocean than that they were pur&s;uing; but the pilot Gomez, and the pur&s;er Guerra, &s;eized and &s;tabbed Alvara de Me&s;quita, the Commander, and carried home the &s;hip. In the mean time, Magellan &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter had befallen her, went him&s;elf in pur&s;uit of her; but after &s;ix days fruitle&s;s &s;earch, he determined to con|tinue his voyage; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and it plea&s;ed God, &s;ays my author, that, at the end of twenty days, he entered into the Great South Sea, and was the fir&s;t who had found the pa&s;&s;age &s;o much &s;ought after, whereby the memory of this ex|cellent Captain &s;hall be eternally celebrated."</Q></P>
<P>Finding that the land trended northwards, Magellan directed his cour&s;e accordingly, that he might as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible clear tho&s;e cold and dreary coa&s;ts that had cau&s;ed &s;o much mur|muring among the mariners, and &s;o much ca|balling among the officers; but before he reached the Tropic he met with mo&s;t tempe&s;|tuous

weather, by which the three remaining &s;hips were very much &s;hattered in their &s;ails and rigging. In this pa&s;&s;age they di&s;covered two uninhabited i&s;lands, St. Pedro and Tiburon, about the &s;ituation of which mariners are &s;till divided; and it has been que&s;tioned, whether either of them have &s;ince been &s;een.</P>
<P>As they approached the Line, they found the wind to &s;tand fair. Magellan then ordered the &s;hips to change their cour&s;e, and &s;teer N. W. and W. N. W. till he reached the Line.</P>
<P>Harris takes notice that it was on the 28th of December when Magellan entered the Great South Sea, and that in this wide ocean the &s;hips that accompanied him &s;ailed three months and twenty days without &s;eeing any other land than the two i&s;lands ju&s;t mentioned, which af|forded them no refre&s;hment. At length, when they had undergone all the mi&s;eries that human nature is capable of &s;u&s;taining, from hunger, thir&s;t, and &s;ickne&s;s, they fell in with the Ladrone i&s;lands, where they landed; but where the in|habitants were &s;uch thieves that they were in fear left their &s;hips &s;hould be pulled to pieces and carried away before their faces, the crews not having &s;trength enough left to defend either their lives or their properties. They therefore &s;hortened their &s;tay among the&s;e plunderers; and were more fortunate in their next attempt.</P>
<P>On the 10th of March, landing on the i&s;land of Zamal, they found &s;prings of delicate water, which to them were more precious than foun|tains
<PB N="xx" REF="35">
of the choice&s;t wines; fruit in abundance, that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any they had till then ta&s;ted; and inhabitants humane and civil, who pitying their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, brought their riche&s;t productions to relieve them. From this i&s;land they continued to &s;teer between the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, till they arrived at Buthuan, or, as it has &s;ince been called, Buton, the King of which gave them honourable entertainment. They vi&s;ited &s;everal other i&s;les, and in all of them were well received; till at length coming to the I&s;le of Mathan, they were attacked by an army of Indians, again&s;t whom the General him&s;elf being engaged was &s;hot with a poi&s;oned arrow, and afterwards pierced in the head with a lance; and thus ended the life and actions of this gallant Com|mander, who&s;e name will be perpetuated with honour to late&s;t po&s;terity. After his death, a company of his followers being invited to an entertainment on &s;hore, were treacherou&s;ly mur|dered by a pretended friendly King, and only Don Juan Serrano, of all who landed, was re|&s;erved alive, in order to procure a large &s;upply of fire-arms and ammunition by way of ran&s;om; but tho&s;e who remained on board, fearful of being trepanned, would have no farther inter|cour&s;e with the perfidious infidels; &s;o that poor Serrano was left to their mercy. Tho&s;e on board the &s;hips, 80 in number, directed their cour&s;e towards the Moluccas, and arrived at Teridore, one of the principal of tho&s;e i&s;lands, on the 8th of November, 1521. Here they
<PB N="xxi" REF="36">
were ho&s;pitably received, and here they &s;taid till the middle of January, 1522; and, being now come into well-known &s;eas, we &s;hall ac|company them no farther; only remarking, that, of the whole &s;quadron only one &s;hip, namely the Victoria, had the good fortune to return to Spain; and of 234 officers and &s;ea|men, the complement at fir&s;t &s;etting out, if we except tho&s;e who returned in the St. Antonio, of whom we have no account, only 13 Spa|niards &s;urvived to return to Seville. Their Commander John Seba&s;tian Cano was received with extraordinary marks of favour by the Em|peror, who gave him for arms the Terre&s;trial Globe, with this motto, <HI>Primus me circumdedi&s;|tis,</HI> and otherwi&s;e liberally rewarded him. The voyage he lived to make took up three years and thirty-&s;even days, and is, perhaps, the mo&s;t remarkable that ever was performed.</P>
<P>This voyage opened a new field for di&s;co|very: the Spaniards, who were already &s;ettled on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of America, were very curious to examine what countries might be &s;ituated along that va&s;t &s;pace which divided the new continent from the old; and accordingly Cortez, the celebrated conqueror of Peru, fitted out two &s;hips for the purpo&s;e, the command of one of which he gave to Ferdinand Grijalva, the other to Don Alvarado.</P>
<P>Grijalva departed from Pageta, in 6 deg. N. lat. about the beginning of April, 1537, and &s;teered W. and S. W. into 29 deg. S. lat. where
<PB N="xxii" REF="37">
his &s;hip &s;pringing her ma&s;t, he &s;tood again to the Line, in which tract a mutiny happening among the crew, Grijalva and his nephew were both a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated; and the &s;hip, after a pa&s;&s;age of four months, was carried to Papua, where falling to pieces, the crew, reduced by famine and fatigue to &s;even men, took to their boat and coa&s;ted along the &s;hore, till being boarded by a num|ber of Indians, it was &s;unk. The Spaniards, however, were &s;aved by the humanity of the captors, and &s;old for &s;laves. This &s;hip, it is affirmed, &s;ailed 1000 leagues on both &s;ides the Line without &s;eeing land. Among the i&s;lands, however, which they afterwards fell in with be|fore they came to Papua, was that called I&s;la de los Pe&s;cadores, called in the late voyages BYRON's ISLAND, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be a new di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Alvarado was in&s;tructed to pur&s;ue his di&s;co|veries along the Line, without deviating either to the right or left, farther than the mo&s;t ad|vantageous method of navigating his &s;hip re|quired; and in that direction he di&s;covered the i&s;lands of Papua. He al&s;o di&s;covered other i&s;lands, named the Guelles, in 1 deg. N. lat. ea&s;t and we&s;t from Teronate, and 125 leagues from that of Moro, with Hamei, 170 leagues from Tidore, and many others that have &s;ince been thought new di&s;coveries. After his return, he was again employed upon &s;ervices of the like kind, and was in&s;trumental in e&s;tabli&s;hing the trade of Manilla.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="38">But of all the Spani&s;h di&s;coveries that have been made, or pretended to have been made, in the South Seas, that of Juan Fernandez, who fir&s;t pointed out the way from Lima to Chili by &s;ailing to the we&s;tward, <HI>if real,</HI> is by far the mo&s;t important. This pilot, (the &s;ame who di&s;covered the i&s;land which &s;till bears his name) in the latitude of 40 deg. S. was brought, as it is &s;aid, in cour&s;es between we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, upon the coa&s;t of a continent, from what he could judge, very fertile and delightful, inha|bited by white people, ho&s;pitable, and well-di&s;po&s;ed, of a middle &s;tature, dre&s;&s;ed in very fine cloaths, and &s;o peaceable and civil, that, in every way they could expre&s;s, they endeavoured to gratify the &s;trangers, and to accommodate them with the be&s;t things their country afforded, the fruits whereof were excellent and abound|ing in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. It is added, that, being over-joyed with having di&s;covered the coa&s;t of that great continent &s;o much talked of, and &s;o ardently &s;ought after, he returned to Chili, intending to make a &s;econd voyage properly fit|ted out to improve this fortunate di&s;covery to his own and his country's enrichment; but be|fore he could per&s;uade his friends to give entire credit to his report, he died, and the &s;ecret of the preci&s;e &s;ituation of his new continent peri&s;h|ed with him, for it has never &s;ince been found; though Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, author of an Hi&s;torical Collection of Voyages to the South Pacific Ocean, who&s;e opinion is of no &s;mall
<PB N="xxiv" REF="39">
weight, is per&s;uaded that Fernandez did di&s;co|ver the SOUTHERN CONTINENT, and that, when|ever it is again vi&s;ited, it will be no new di&s;co|very, but a confirmation of the exi&s;tence of that land which has already been found.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides this dubious di&s;covery, there is &s;till another, which has not yet been clearly a&s;|certained, and about which geographers are much divided. This di&s;covery is attributed to Alvaro Mendana, who, in 1567, is &s;aid to have fallen in with a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands abounding with gold and pearl, which were named by him the I&s;les of Salomon; and for the &s;ettling of which an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt was made by Mendana him&s;elf; and a &s;econd &s;trongly &s;olicited by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, the chief pilot who accompanied that General, and who afterwards made a voyage thither on his own account, in which he made many di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>It was in April, 1595, that Mendana left Callao, in Peru, to &s;ettle the Salomon I&s;les. He had with him two large &s;hips, a gallea&s;ta, and a frigate, on board of which were embarked from Lima 400 followers, including women and children. Of this embarkation Lope de la Vega, his brother-in-law, was Admiral; Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, chief pilot; and Pedro Merino Manriquez, Maitre de Campo. Ac|cording to Figueroa, who wrote an account of this voyage, the Admiral's &s;hip was named the St. I&s;abella; Mendana's &s;hip, the St. Jerome; the gallea&s;ta, St. Philippe; and the frigate, St.
<PB N="xxv" REF="40">
Catalina: of the two la&s;t the Commanders were Capt. Philip Cor&ccedil;o, and Lieut. Alonzo de Leyla. In this expedition Mendana was ac|companied by his Lady Donna I&s;abella Barre|tos, with her three brothers; and, after parting company with the Admiral's &s;hip the very night they came in &s;ight of the i&s;land on which they &s;ettled, Mendana ca&s;t anchor in a bay which he called <HI>la Gracio&s;a,</HI> and the i&s;land he named Santa Cruz. Here, on the 8th of October, the Maitre de Campo, and Thomas de Ampuero, were hanged, and En&s;ign Jean de Buy beheaded, for mutinous behaviour; and here Mendana him|&s;elf died the 18th of the &s;ame month. Don Lorenzo, brother to Donna I&s;abella, who, by the lo&s;s of the Admiral, had &s;ucceeded as Captain-General, died al&s;o on the 2d of November; and, in le&s;s than &s;even days after, Father Antonio de Serra, Chief Prie&s;t, and Juan de E&s;pino&s;a, his Vicar. In &s;hort, from change of climate, food, and cu&s;toms; from labour, going in the &s;un, being wet without having wherewithal to &s;hift them&s;elves, &s;leeping on the ground, and from other di&s;orders and &s;ufferings, dangerous di&s;|ea&s;es attacked the whole company; they began to die a-pace, it being lamentable to &s;ee them in their di&s;tre&s;s creeping into huts, &s;ome delirious, and others at the la&s;t ga&s;p; &s;ome going to the &s;hips to &s;eek health; others &s;hifting from the &s;hips to the &s;hore; but no remedy, nor any phy&s;ician to apply to for relief. In this calamitous &s;tate things were, when Donna I&s;abella, on the 18th
<PB N="xxvi" REF="41">
of October, broke up the &s;ettlement; and em|barking the few people that remained alive, on board the St. Jerome, the frigate, and the gal|lea&s;ta, they &s;et &s;ail, intending to pur&s;ue their cour&s;e to Manilla: but the frigate &s;oon lo&s;t com|pany, and, it is &s;aid, was afterwards found on a defart coa&s;t with all her &s;ails &s;et, and the people on board dead and rotten; and the gallea&s;ta put into an i&s;land near the coa&s;t of Mindanao. The St. Jerome, however, after &s;uffering un&s;peakable hard&s;hips, got to Manilla, where Donna I&s;a|bella married Don Ferdinando de Ca&s;tro, and returned in his &s;hip to New Spain the very next year. The Admiral's &s;hip was never heard of.&mdash;Thus ended this unfortunate expedition.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Santa Cruz, in which this &s;ettlement was attempted, is &s;aid to be 100 leagues in circumference, and to lie E. S. E. and W. N. W. in lat. 10 deg. 20 min. S. di&s;|tant from Lima 1800 leagues. They ca&s;t an|chor on the north &s;ide of it, in a harbour, to the north of which is a volcano, or burning moun|tain, that from its top frequently ca&s;ts forth fire, and from the in&s;ide of which proceeds a noi&s;e &s;ometimes louder than thunder. To the we&s;t of the harbour is a &s;mall i&s;land about four leagues in compa&s;s, &s;eparated from the great i&s;land by &s;unken rocks and banks of &s;and. The port is formed at the bottom of the bay by a great ri|ver, and the country round it is fine and plenti|ful. A more exact de&s;cription than this, one would think, could not have been given.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="42">Quiros, who navigated Donna I&s;abella, fir&s;t to Manilla, and afterwards accompanied her to New Spain, was &s;o charmed with the beautiful appearance of the&s;e enchanting i&s;lands, that he continued for the &s;pace of ten years ince&s;&s;antly to weary the Court of Spain with memorial af|ter memorial to renew the &s;ettlement of them; and at length he prevailed.&mdash;Previous to his voyage, he &s;pent &s;everal months in building two &s;hips and a zebra, the &s;toure&s;t and be&s;t equipped with men, provi&s;ions, and warlike &s;tores, of any that had ever been fitted out in New Spain. He was accompanied by &s;ix Fran|ci&s;can Fathers, with whom he took his depar|ture on the 21&s;t of December, 1605; and &s;ail|ing without any material incident till the 26th of January 1606, he on that day fell in with an i&s;land to the &s;outh-we&s;t, ju&s;t 1000 leagues from the coa&s;t of Peru, in lat. 25 deg. S. which i&s;land he unluckily found uninhabited. From this i&s;land he &s;ailed on different cour&s;es, pa&s;&s;ing &s;eve|ral inacce&s;&s;ible i&s;lands, till the 10th of February, on which day a &s;ailor joyfully cried out, <HI>Land a-head!</HI> Here, on their landing, they &s;urprized a woman, but &s;o old in appearance, that it was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that &s;he could &s;tand up|right. In her youthful days it was ea&s;y to per|ceive that &s;he had been of a graceful mien, and &s;he &s;till retained a dignity about her that &s;hew|ed &s;he was of quality. Being a&s;ked by &s;igns to go on board, &s;he complied without he&s;itation; and when there, &s;he eat of whatever was given
<PB N="xxviii" REF="43">
her, and received pre&s;ents with a becoming ea&s;e. After cloathing this lady very fine, they &s;et her on &s;hore; and, on her landing, the people flock|ed about her, and among them a tall, &s;tout, well-made man, who had on his head a plume of feathers, and by his deportment appeared to be a Chief. Him they endeavoured to entice on board; but, when he came to the &s;hip's &s;ide, fearing treachery, he refu&s;ed to enter. Quiros directed that no force might be u&s;ed, made him &s;ome pre&s;ents, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. This i&s;land by ob&s;ervation was in 17 deg. 40 min. S. and was named by Quiros Sagitaria. They left it on the 12th, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the in|habitants, and, pa&s;&s;ing by &s;everal other i&s;lands, in which they could procure no refre&s;hment, on the 2d of March they fell in with an i&s;land which promi&s;ed fair to &s;upply their wants. Here on their attempting to land they were ac|co&s;ted by about 100 Indians, the talle&s;t, gen|teele&s;t, white&s;t, and &s;tronge&s;t-made people they had ever yet &s;een; but, though they &s;hewed fair in countenance, they were in fact the cru|elle&s;t enemies they had to encounter in the whole voyage. One of them in a &s;wift canoe ap|proached the &s;hip &s;ingly, and, brandi&s;hing his lance, made tho&s;e kind of contortions with his face, arms, and legs, by which Parkin&s;on has re|marked the South-Sea Indians provoke their ene|mies to battle; he even mounted the balcony of the Admiral's &s;hip, and with his lance made a thru&s;t at one of the officers on the quarter|deck,
<PB N="xxix" REF="44">
with an intent to kill him, and in&s;tantly leaping into his canoe rowed off at a great rate. He repeated his vi&s;its and his in&s;olence; but it was not long before they &s;hot him dead. While this was pa&s;&s;ing on board the Admiral, the ze|bra, that had ca&s;t anchor near the &s;hore, was &s;till in a wor&s;e &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by a multitude of fierce barbarians, who, having fa&s;tened a rope to her head, were endeavouring to drag her on &s;hore; but perceiving that the people on board were preparing to cut the rope, they pu&s;hed a little off, and were fa&s;tening it to the cable, when a volley of &s;mall arms was di&s;charged among them, by which &s;ome were killed, &s;ome wounded, and all terribly frightened: this, however, failed of the de&s;ired effect; for nei|ther kindne&s;s nor cha&s;ti&s;ement could prevail upon them to furni&s;h the &s;hips with water or provi&s;ions; &s;o that they were obliged to &s;et &s;ail without a &s;upply of either. This i&s;land lies north and &s;outh, and was called by Quiros the I&s;land of Hand&s;ome People.</P>
<P>They now pur&s;ued their cour&s;e for the i&s;land of Santa Cruz without interruption till the 7th of April, when they di&s;covered land bearing W. N. W. high, and black like a volcano; but night coming on, they &s;tood off till next morn|ing, and then &s;ent the zebra to look out for a &s;afe harbour for the &s;hips to ca&s;t anchor. On the 9th &s;he returned, having &s;ucceeded; and about noon the &s;ame day the &s;hips were moor|ed in 25 fathom water, to the great joy of the
<PB N="xxx" REF="45">
de&s;ponding crew. The boats were in&s;tantly di&s;patched to make peace with the natives; and before night, they returned with water, plan|tains, cocoa-nuts, potatoes, palmetos, and &s;ugar-canes, than which the riches of Poto&s;i could not have been more welcome. They next day di&s;|covered a fort, con&s;tructed by art, the materials of coral &s;tone, in which were about 70 hou&s;es &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and de&s;igned as a refuge from enemies, whenever an inva&s;ion was threat|ened by the warlike inhabitants of the adjoining country. To this fort they made their next ap|proach, and, le&s;t they &s;hould meet with oppo&s;i|tion, they took care to be properly armed; but the inhabitants were de&s;irous of nothing &s;o much as peace, and received them ho&s;pitably: &s;o dif|ferent are the di&s;po&s;itions of people inhabiting the &s;ame climate, and &s;eparated only by a por|tion of the &s;ea. Here they were &s;upplied at an ea&s;y rate with wood and water, in the &s;hipping of which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the friendly na|tives; and here they had plenty of the fruits and provi&s;ions which the country produced; in re|turn for which, the grateful Spaniards &s;eized four of the natives, with a view to carry them off; but in &s;pite of their vigilance three made their e&s;cape, and only one c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntinued with them, who, being a &s;lave where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, cared but little what ma&s;ter he &s;erved in that capacity.</P>
<P>At the end of &s;even days, the people being pretty well refre&s;hed, Quiros again &s;et &s;ail, and on the 21&s;t of April pa&s;&s;ed an i&s;land in lat. 12
<PB N="xxxi" REF="46">
degrees S. which the Indians called Tuoopia. They now approached the i&s;lands of which they were in que&s;t; and on the 25th a con&s;ultation was held on board the Admiral, to con&s;ider which of the lands in &s;ight they would chu&s;e to &s;ettle, when it was concluded not to return to Santa Cruz, but to &s;tand to the &s;outhward in &s;earch of that great land, of which they had heard &s;o much. This they did, pa&s;&s;ing many i&s;lands, &s;ome of con&s;iderable extent, &s;ome &s;mall but very populous, and all of them exhibiting a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect of woods, lawns, in|clo&s;ures, and water-falls, till at length in lat. 14 deg. 50 min. S. they came to a land &s;tretch|ing from ea&s;t to we&s;t, to the extent of which they could &s;ee no end. On the zebra's ap|proaching this land, the people on board were not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee an Indian come down from the mountains, and without invita|tion throw him&s;elf into the &s;ea, and make to|wards the &s;hip. A boat was immediately hoi&s;t|ed out, in order to take him up; but as he ap|peared &s;pirited and &s;trong, and made the u&s;ual contortions by way of defiance, it was judged proper to confine him, by clapping a chain upon his legs to prevent mi&s;chief. In this man|ner they purpo&s;ed to have carried him on board the Admiral, who wanted to get &s;ome native in his power to u&s;e with kindne&s;s, in order to facilitate a peace; but, perceiving their intent, and concluding that his impri&s;onment was a prelude to his death, he &s;eized in his pa&s;&s;age a
<PB N="xxxii" REF="47">
favourable opportunity, and &s;napping his chains with his hands, leapt &s;uddenly into the &s;ea. Night coming on, it was in vain to pur&s;ue him, and accordingly they continued their cour&s;e to acquaint the Admiral with what had happened. They had &s;carce been an hour on board, when the watch on the foreca&s;tle called out, <HI>A voice!</HI> and knowing it to be that of a native, they in|&s;tantly handed him up, when, to the great &s;ur|prize of the boat's crew, who had ju&s;t come on board, they perceived, by the remains of the chain about his leg, that it was the man who had made his e&s;cape. He was quite exhau&s;ted with &s;wimming, and cho&s;e rather to &s;urrender to the &s;trangers than peri&s;h in the &s;ea. He was kindly received, had wine and &s;weet-meats given him, put to bed, and in the morning was richly cloathed in taffety, and &s;ent on &s;hore: in return for which civilities, he cau&s;ed a number of hogs to be &s;ent on board, with plantains and other fruits; but at the &s;ame time he gave his bene|factors to under&s;tand, that he was not to be di|verted from the defence of his country, by the di&s;|&s;embled kindne&s;s of pretended friends. When, therefore, the Spaniards attempted to land, a few Indians, headed by this gallant Chief, appeared upon the &s;hore, and, feigning to conduct them to an open beach, led them along the &s;kirts of a wood, where a numerous body of natives lay con|cealed, who watching their opportunity, let fly a volley of poi&s;oned arrows, by which, however, one Spaniard only was wounded in the face.
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="48">
The Spaniards returned the compliment, by a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry; but the oppo&s;ition they expected from the&s;e <HI>uncivilized barbarians</HI> (for &s;o they are called for defending their country) deterred them from pro&s;ecuting their de&s;ign. They returned to their &s;hips without &s;etting foot on &s;hore; and, on their return, finding them&s;elves mi&s;taken, it was thought proper again to put to &s;ea, in &s;earch of that great country and that friendly people, of who&s;e hap|py &s;ituation they had heard &s;o much.</P>
<P>On the 30th of April, about three in the afternoon, &s;teering &s;outh-we&s;t, they di&s;covered land right a-head, and before night came up with it. In the morning the zebra was &s;ent along &s;hore to examine the &s;oundings, and after twelve hours ab&s;ence returned, and made report, that they had found a &s;pacious bay, and had ex|changed &s;ome trifles with a people of an enor|mous &s;ize, who, neverthele&s;s, appeared to be good natured, and de&s;irous of peace. This news gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. The &s;hips fol|lowed their pilot; and it being the day of St. Philip and St. James when they arrived, they called the bay by that name. Here they found a mo&s;t delightful port, &s;ituated between two noble rivers (the one they named the Jordan, and the other Salvador); the people numerous and friendly; the climate mild and &s;erene; and the air &s;o whole&s;ome, that in a few days all the &s;ick recovered. The &s;oil they afterwards found fruitful to a degree of luxuriance; the woods
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="49">
and plains abounding with herds and bea&s;ts of various kinds, and the &s;eas well &s;tored with fi&s;h. In &s;hort, nothing was wanting to com|plete their wi&s;hes, but a more numerous com|pany to &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. On their fir&s;t land|ing the Spaniards were ho&s;pitably received; but when it was perceived, by their overtures for peace, that they intended to prolong their &s;tay, a jealou&s;y aro&s;e that they came with no good de&s;ign; and they were treated afterwards as enemies and invaders. All friendly inter|cour&s;e very &s;oon cea&s;ed; the market for provi|&s;ions was &s;topt; and nothing was to be obtained to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon but by force or &s;tratagem. While they were on the&s;e terms, an incident happened that it was thought would at once have put an end to their fears and their hopes. Among the vegetables which grew wild, and on which they were obliged chiefly to live, they had gathered &s;ome poi&s;onous plants, of which the people in general had eaten, and all who had eaten &s;oon began to feel the direful effects. The &s;ymptoms were the more alarming, as all parts of the fle&s;h &s;eemed to partake of the nox|ious quality of the plants. The &s;hips were like the ho&s;pitals of a city infected with the plague, where the numbers of the healthy were not &s;uffi|cient to admini&s;ter to the infirmities of the &s;ick. Nothing, in &s;hort, was to be heard but lamen|tations and &s;upplications; all expected to die without remedy. But their fears, as it fell out, were greater than their danger; for, after a cer|tain
<PB N="xxxv" REF="50">
time, the violence of the poi&s;on abated, and the &s;ick were re&s;tored to a more vigorous &s;tate of health than they enjoyed before. But they were &s;carce relieved from this misfortune, when another &s;ucceeded. De&s;pairing of ever being able to reconcile them&s;elves to the natives at this port, they &s;et &s;ail, after having founded a city between the <HI>Jordan</HI> and the <HI>Salvador,</HI> to which they had given the name of <HI>New Jeru&s;a|lem.</HI> Coa&s;ting towards the &s;outh with a view to find a more fortunate &s;ettlement, they were overtaken by a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm, in which the &s;hips were &s;eparated. The Admiral was driven off the coa&s;t, and never again returned; but the other &s;hip, and the zebra, with difficulty returned to port. What afterwards became of them we are not told. Quiros, after attempting in vain to rejoin them, made the be&s;t of his way to New Spain; and on his arrival undertook a voyage to Old Spain, where he continued to &s;olicit the Court for a new embarkation; but he died before he could obtain it.</P>
<P>From this time the Spaniards &s;eem to have given over all thoughts of a &s;ettlement in tho&s;e i&s;lands, to the true &s;ituation of which they appear at this day to be &s;trangers. Neither have other nations been more &s;ucce&s;sful in their attempts to di&s;cover them; for unle&s;s (as Mr. Alexan|der Dalrymple has endeavoured to prove in his Hi&s;torical Collection of Voyages to the South Pacific Ocean) they are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which Dampier has dignified with the name of
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="51">
New Britain, no others have yet been found that an&s;wer to their de&s;cription. To Mr. Dal|rymple's data there can be only one objection, and that is this: Quiros, in his memorial to the Court of Spain, reporting the voyage of Men|dana, &s;ays, that, in pro&s;ecuting his di&s;coveries, he fell in with four i&s;lands [the Marque&s;&s;as], inhabited by &s;o good a people, that there is no account of any other having ever been found equal to them; and that the&s;e i&s;lands were 1000 leagues from Lima, 650 from the neare&s;t coa&s;t of New Spain, and 1000 leagues from New Guinea. Here the di&s;tance from Lima to New Guinea is preci&s;ely fixed by Quiros; but at the &s;ame time it is to be noted, that the di&s;tance from Lima to the i&s;les in que&s;tion are as pre|ci&s;ely fixed; and in the &s;ame memorial they are &s;aid to be between the 7th and 12th degrees of &s;outh latitude, 1500 leagues from the city of Lima. Thus they are placed by Quiros, pre|ci&s;ely in the midway between the Marque&s;&s;as and New Guinea; whereas the i&s;les called New Britain are divided by Dampier from New Guinea to the ea&s;tward only by a &s;trait.</P>
<P>But this by the bye.&mdash;We &s;hall now proceed to relate what other material di&s;coveries have been made by other nations in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, particularly by the Dutch:&mdash;Le Maire and Schouten left the Texel on June the 14th, 1615; and pa&s;&s;ing Strait Le Maire Janu|ary 25, 1616, on the 10th of April the &s;ame year fell in with an i&s;land in latitude 15 deg.

12 min. S. 3700 miles from the coa&s;t of Peru, to which they gave the name of DOG ISLAND. Pur&s;uing their coa&s;t to the i&s;les of Salomon, on the 16th they came to another i&s;land, in lat. 14 deg. 46 min. S. to which they gave the name of WATERLAND, becau&s;e in this i&s;land, tho' un|inhabited, they found a &s;upply of fre&s;h water, and &s;ome herbs, of which they gathered &s;ackfuls to make pottage to refre&s;h the men, who were now much afflicted with the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May they &s;aw many dolphins, the fir&s;t they had &s;een in the South-Seas.</P>
<P>On the 11th, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal uninhabited i&s;lots, they di&s;covered an i&s;land in lat. 16 deg. 10 min. S. where they had an engagement with the natives, whom they found to be great thieves; they were, however, very hand&s;ome; their limbs well-proportioned, of large &s;tature, quite naked, excellent &s;wimmers, and very active. This i&s;land they called Cocos I&s;land, becau&s;e they were here plentifully &s;upplied with that fruit. A league from it lay another, which they named Traitors I&s;land, becau&s;e the inhabitants had formed a de|&s;ign to cut them off.</P>
<P>On the 18th, having &s;ailed near 5000 miles from the coa&s;t of Peru, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;outhern land, or falling in with the &s;o much celebrated I&s;les of Salomon, and being in lat. 16 deg. 5 min. S. it was there con|&s;idered in full council what cour&s;e to &s;teer next; when it was determined to return home by the well known track to the northward of New Guinea.
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="53">
In pur&s;uit of this re&s;olution they changed their cour&s;e to the N. N. W. and on the 22d, being in lat 14 deg. 56 min S. they fell in with an i&s;land which, by its beautiful appearance, pro|mi&s;ed fair to afford refre&s;hment. Sending the &s;hallop to &s;ound, they found 50 fathom, &s;and and &s;hells, in a kind of ba&s;on over-again&s;t a &s;mall river i&s;&s;uing from a valley edged with trees. This gave un&s;peakable plea&s;ure to the whole company.</P>
<P>On the 23d they moored the &s;hip; and, while they were yet bu&s;y, they were vi&s;ited by whole troops of the natives, who expre&s;&s;ed their admi|ration a thou&s;and different ways. At length, a venerable old man approached the &s;hip, and with great gravity made an oration, at the con|clu&s;ion of which, the people who &s;urrounded him expre&s;&s;ed their approbation by general ac|clamations. A traffic for provi&s;ions now com|menced; and, after a pretty &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;h, in which half a dozen natives were killed by the mu&s;quetry, the &s;ame was continued till their departure with great civility and hone&s;ty. The Chiefs of the i&s;land, after an exchange of ho&s;|tages, came on board, and were magnificently entertained. They were given to under&s;tand, that the &s;hips were in want of water, and they made their people a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upplying their wants. They cau&s;ed hogs, dogs, fowls, and fruits, to be &s;ent in plenty, which were exchanged for nails, beads, dolls, and looking-gla&s;&s;es. As a pre&s;ent, when the Chiefs returned to &s;hore, they &s;ent to

the Commander two hogs ready dre&s;t; they had taken out the entrails, and put in the place of them burning &s;tones, to roa&s;t them in the in&s;ide, and &s;weet herbs to make them &s;avoury. In &s;hort, their manners, their de&s;ires, their behaviour, their cu&s;toms, their habitations, and their arts, &s;o exactly corre&s;pond with what has lately been reported of the inhabitants of the &s;uppo&s;ed new|ly di&s;covered i&s;lands in the South Seas, that there does not remain a doubt, but that this i&s;land which the Dutch named Hoorne I&s;land, toge|ther with the adjoining i&s;land which they called the I&s;land of Good Hope, are two of tho&s;e that lie between the 10th and 17th degrees of &s;outh latitude, of which our late voyagers have given &s;o flattering an account. One particular re|ported by the Dutch is &s;trikingly characteri&s;tic: The men, &s;ay they, were valiant, and large in &s;tature, the talle&s;t among them &s;urpa&s;&s;ing very much in height the talle&s;t of ours; <HI>their wo|men were not hand&s;ome, but &s;o totally de&s;titute of &s;hame, that what mode&s;ty requires to be done in pri|vacy, they performed with their men in public, by way of entertainment, before their Kings.</HI> In the new map accompanying Hawke&s;worth's Voyages, King George's I&s;land is placed in the latitude of 14 deg. 29 min. S. long. 148 deg. 50 min. W. In the Dutch maps Hoorne I&s;land is placed in lat. 14 deg. 56 min. S. long. 83 deg. 30 min. W. from Arica, on the coa&s;t of Peru, which an&s;wers to long. 153 deg. 30 min. W. from London, be|ing only 2 deg. 40 min. more to the we&s;t, and
<PB N="xl" REF="56">
27 min. more to the &s;outh than King George's I&s;land; a difference very incon&s;iderable indeed! allowing for the difference of time from 1616 to 1765, and for the improvement that has been made in the in&s;truments of navigation during that period, particularly in tho&s;e for a&s;certain|ing longitude.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of June, as has been already ob&s;erved, they took their departure from Hoorne I&s;land, highly plea&s;ed with their kind reception, and on the 25th came in &s;ight of the coa&s;t of New Guinea.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have mentioned, that Schouten was of opinion, that Hoorne I&s;land was one of the Salomon I&s;les, mentioned by Quiros, none other they had met with having an&s;wered &s;o well to the Spani&s;h de&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>The next remarkable voyage, undertaken profe&s;&s;edly with a view to di&s;covery in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, is that of Abel Jan&s;an Ta&s;man, who, in 1642, &s;ailed from Batavia in the Ea&s;t Indies, and touched at the I&s;les of Mauritius, in latitude 20 deg. 20 min. South; long. 78 deg. 47 min. Ea&s;t. On the 8th of October, the &s;ame year, he left the Mauritius, and, keeping a &s;outherly cour&s;e, on the 24th of September fell in with the land, to which he gave the name of Anthony Van Diemen's land, in 42 deg. 25 min. S. long. 163 deg. 50 min. E. Here they met with much bad weather, which obliged them to &s;teer ea&s;tward; and on the 1&s;t of December they anchored in lat. 43 deg.
<PB N="xli" REF="57">
10 min. S. long. 167 deg. 55 min. E. in a bay to which they gave the name of Frederic Hen|ry's bay. Their whole force con&s;i&s;ted only of a &s;mall &s;hip about 300 tons, named the Hem&s;|kirk, and the Zee Haan pink for examining the coa&s;t. Here they landed, but could di&s;cover no human being, though they had rea&s;on to believe the country was inhabited. They ga|thered plenty of good pot-herbs that grew wild, and &s;aw trees full two fathom and an half in the girt, and from 60 to 75 feet high, in which &s;teps had been cut for the purpo&s;e of climbing them, five feet di&s;tant from each o|ther; and from this circum&s;tance they con|cluded that the inhabitants mu&s;t be men of gi|gantic &s;tature.</P>
<P>On the 5th of December, Ta&s;man pur&s;ued his cour&s;e in &s;earch of the Salomon I&s;les, and on the 13th had &s;ight of a very high and mountainous country, now well known by the name of New Zealand. By its lofty appear|ance, he judged it to be the &s;outhern continent, and coa&s;ted it along to the north ea&s;tward, till on the 18th of December, he came to a &s;pa|cious bay, three or four miles in breadth, in lat. 40 deg. 49 min. S. long. 191 deg. 41 min. from whence he could di&s;cern on the &s;hore men of a &s;trong robu&s;t make, partly clothed, and partly naked, to whom he made &s;ignals, inviting them on board, but none of them would ven|ture to approach within the reach of a pete|raro. It was therefore re&s;olved to go to them;
<PB N="xlii" REF="58">
but before that re&s;olution could be carried into execution, the barbarians made an attack upon the Zee Haan's boat, and murdered mo&s;t of the crew, in the manner related in the cour&s;e of the work.</P>
<P>Not caring to &s;acrifice any more of his peo|ple again&s;t a barbarous race of man&s;layers, he weighed anchor, and pur&s;ued his voyage along the coa&s;t till he came to an i&s;land in latitude 34 deg. 25 min. S. which he named THREE KING'S ISLAND, where &s;ome of his people landed, and where they &s;aw at a di&s;tance about 40 men of an uncommon &s;tature, who called to them in a very gruff tone of voice, and ap|proached them ha&s;tily with prodigious &s;trides. The Dutchmen, being few in number thought fit to retreat. Their bu&s;ine&s;s being that of di&s;|covery, not of war, the Captain thought fit to quit that inho&s;pitable coa&s;t, and direct his cour&s;e to the i&s;lands of Cocos or Hoorne, where he was &s;ure of refre&s;hing his men, and &s;upplying their wants without danger of blood|&s;hed, happy that he could find a pa&s;&s;age into an open &s;ea. On this coa&s;t, however, he ob|&s;erved many fair plantations, hand&s;omely laid out, and to all appearance well cultivated.</P>
<P>On the 19th of January, 1643, he di&s;cover|ed three i&s;lands, to which he gave names. The &s;outhernmo&s;t he called Pyl&s;taart's I&s;land, the middlemo&s;t Am&s;terdam, and the mo&s;t northerly Middleburgh. This la&s;t lay in lat. 21 deg. 20 min. S. long. 205 deg. 20 minutes.
<PB N="xliii" REF="59">
At the&s;e i&s;lands, which &s;eemed remote from any other land, they trafficked for provi&s;ions; and the inhabitants, who were of a tawney com|plexion, and &s;omewhat above the common &s;ize, behaved very civilly, and &s;hewed no &s;igns of a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition. Among the natives of the&s;e i&s;lands came a lu&s;ty man with a St. Thomas's arm, and a woman with a natural beard. A venerable old man came al&s;o among the re&s;t, and made an oration; after which a croud of men and women, young and old, came on board with all kinds of provi&s;ions. It is re|markable, that, among all the i&s;lands in the South Seas, the only tame four-footed animals are hogs and dogs, and of the&s;e the inhabitants here had plenty. They found another i&s;land at no great di&s;tance, equally abounding in the u&s;ual productions, be&s;ides being plentifully &s;upplied with water. It appears &s;trange to us, that the people in tho&s;e hot climates can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without fre&s;h water; yet nature &s;eems in part to have &s;upplied that defect by furni&s;hing a fruit that both allays thir&s;t and a&s;&s;uages hunger, and that too without either art or la|bour. By vegetables &s;uited to their &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence, it &s;hould &s;eem that the animals, indigenous to the climate, are nouri&s;hed and made fat. Indeed, where &s;prings, brooks, and lakes are wanting, the fore&s;ts have few, if any, inhabi|tants; but if we may credit the relations of voyagers, the people have hogs and dogs, where they have neither river, well, or lake;
<PB N="xliv" REF="60">
for though in Am&s;terdam I&s;land, the &s;trangers might have purcha&s;ed 100 hogs a day for a few baubles, yet a can of fre&s;h water was not to be procured at any rate. In an i&s;land, called by the natives Annamokka, but by the Dutch Rotterdam, water was found in plenty, yet it was no better inhabited than the i&s;lands before mentioned, which &s;eemed to be wholly without. Rotterdam I&s;land is placed in lat. 20 deg. 15 min. S. long 206 deg. 19 min. To this i&s;land they repaired to take in water, and there they com|pleated their &s;tock, of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, finding the people courteous and civil, though &s;ome|what inclined to be thievi&s;h, Being now fully refre&s;hed and provided, without making any further di&s;coveries worth relating, they re|turned to Java, by the way of New Guinea.</P>
<P>Jacob Roggewein was the next Dutchman who &s;ailed profe&s;&s;edly on the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;co|very. He was furni&s;hed by their Ea&s;t-India Company with three &s;hips, namely, the Eagle, the Tienh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">n, and the African Galley: with the&s;e he &s;et &s;ail from Am&s;terdam, July the 16th, 1721, and towards the latter end of November came in &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Brazil. After a few days &s;tay in the neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, he weighed, and went in que&s;t of Hawkins's Maiden Land, which is &s;aid to lie in 30 deg. S. but not being able to find it, he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e towards the &s;traits, till on the 21&s;t of December, in lat. 40 deg. S. the &s;hips met with a violent &s;torm, in which the
<PB N="xlv" REF="61">
Tienhoven lo&s;t company. About the begin|ning of January, Roggewein di&s;covered a large i&s;land 200 leagues in circuit, in lat. 52 deg. S. long. 95. deg. W. about 80 leagues from the coa&s;t of America. He named this i&s;land BEL|CIA AUSTRALIS, and it is the &s;ame now known by the name of Falkland's I&s;land. Leaving this i&s;land to windward, he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;trait of Le Maire, and on the 24th of February came in &s;ight of Juan Fernandez, where he fortu|nately found the Tienhoven, that i&s;land having been he place appointed to rendezvous in ca&s;e of &s;eparation.</P>
<P>There the &s;hips continued three weeks, and &s;ailed from thence about the middle of March, &s;teering W. N. W. in &s;earch of Davis's Land, which, however, they could not find. Neither has that or Hawkins's Maiden Land ever been &s;een by any other navigator except the fir&s;t di&s;co|verers. Being in lat. 28 deg. S. long. 268 deg. they &s;aw many birds and other tokens of high land, but to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the Admiral came in &s;ight of none till they had &s;ailed 12 leagues farther we&s;t. They then di&s;covered an i&s;land, which they called EASTER-ISLAND, be|cau&s;e they came in &s;ight of it on Ea&s;ter-day. They found this i&s;land well inhabited. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">an that came on board was painted with various kinds of figures, was of a brown com|plexion, with large ears, &s;o long that they hung down to his &s;houlders. He was tall, ro|bu&s;t, active, of an agreeable countenance, and
<PB N="xlvi" REF="62">
lively dipo&s;ition. They offered him wine, but he threw it in his eyes. They gave him meat, cloathed him, and &s;ent him on &s;hore, but afterwards killed him in a &s;kirmi&s;h with his countrymen. On this i&s;land they ob&s;erved many idols, and &s;aw one man quite white, whom they took to be a prie&s;t. He had pen|dents in his ears a pound weight each. On landing 150 in number, the natives crouded &s;o clo&s;e upon them, that they were forced to fire upon them to keep them off. By this di&s;|charge &s;everal were killed, and many wounded. The&s;e poor people, &s;eeing their friends bleed, and fall dead, filled the air with doleful cries and lamentations; and brought offerings of fruits, roots, and fowls, to appea&s;e the wrath of the invaders. To implore the bodies of their murdered friends, they ca&s;t them&s;elves on the earth, and made other &s;igns of &s;upplication. They were indulged in their timidity, and it was held a crime to approach a Dutchman without reverence; when they brought them pre&s;ents, they laid them at their feet.</P>
<P>This country was full of inclo&s;ures, and &s;eem|ed neatly cultivated. The people had coverings of a manufacture that felt &s;oft like &s;ilk. The women in general were painted with a rouge far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in brightne&s;s any thing of that colour known in Europe; they were very obliging, and enticed the &s;trangers to every kind of familiarity both by their looks and ge&s;tures. Their idols were chiefly of &s;tone,
<PB N="xlvii" REF="63">
well-proportioned, and wrought with exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. While they lay at anchor at this delightful i&s;land, a &s;torm aro&s;e, which pre|vented the Admiral's de&s;ign of extending his re|&s;earches to the remoter parts of it, as it appear|ed diver&s;ified with woods, fore&s;ts, lawns, gar|dens, and cultivated fields; and in every re|&s;pect well &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries for the re|fre&s;hment of &s;hips bound to the &s;outhern lands; but the fury of the &s;torm increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that tho&s;e on &s;hore were glad to recover their &s;hips. They were &s;carce embarked when the billows ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, as to make it dangerous to hazard their &s;ecurity to the anchors with which they were moored; they, therefore, in&s;tantly weighed and put to &s;ea, and, as the wind blew fair, they proceeded at a great rate towards the bad &s;ea of Schouten, to which they were bound. After a run of 800 leagues from <HI>Ea&s;ter-I&s;land,</HI> they got &s;ight of an i&s;land in latitude 15 deg. 45 min. S. which they took to be <HI>Dog-I&s;land,</HI> di&s;covered by Schouten, and therefore did not &s;tay to examine it.</P>
<P>The trade-wind began now to &s;hift, and to veer about to the &s;outh-we&s;t, by which the &s;hips in the night were driven among a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, and the African galley being a head was jammed between the rocks, of which a more particular account will be found in the cour&s;e of the Work.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands were &s;ituated between the 15th and 16th degrees of &s;outh latitude; and Rog|gewein's

<HI>Pernicious I&s;land</HI> is no doubt the &s;ame with that where Commodore Byron found the carved head of a rudder that had belonged to a Dutch long-boat, and where he al&s;o found a piece of hammered iron, a piece of bra&s;s, and &s;ome &s;mall iron tools, which the ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent race of inhabitants had obtained from this &s;hip after her &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>Here the crews of the remaining &s;hips grew trouble&s;ome and unruly. They had already been out ten months, and had experienced no|thing but hard&s;hips, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of advantage, either to them&s;elves or country. A council was therefore called, and it was de|termined to return home by way of the Ea&s;t-Indies. On quitting Pernicious I&s;land they fell in with a &s;mall i&s;land, which they called Aurora, becau&s;e it was di&s;covered at break of day; and &s;oon after with another &s;mall i&s;land, which they called Ve&s;per, becau&s;e they came in &s;ight of it in the evening. About twenty-five leagues to the we&s;tward of Pernicious I&s;land, they found them&s;elves entangled among a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, which they called the Labyrinth, becau&s;e it was &s;ome time before they could di&s;engage the &s;hips from the rocks and &s;hoals with which they were &s;urrounded. Having providentially e&s;caped this imminent danger, they continued their cour&s;e to the we&s;tward; and, after &s;ome days &s;ail, fell in with an i&s;land, which by its beautiful appear|ance promi&s;ed &s;ome refre&s;hment. They &s;aw many natives with lances and long pikes pa&s;|&s;ing

and repa&s;&s;ing along the &s;hore, and they &s;ent two boats well manned to &s;peak with them, and to encourage them to trade. Their endeavours, however, were ineffectual, till, by killing &s;ome, and di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t, they made good their landing. When they had gained the &s;hore, the &s;avages &s;eemed more tractable; they even a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed them in gathering herbs, and bringing them water; the women, in particular, appeared ena|moured with them, and by many alluring ways endeavoured to gain their confidence; but they were to the la&s;t degree deceitful. Being de|coyed into an ambu&s;cade, the &s;avages &s;urround|ed them on all &s;ides, and, notwith&s;tanding a bri&s;k fire was kept up, which killed many, and wounded more, not a Dutchman that fell into the &s;nare e&s;caped unwounded. After this mis|fortune it was with reluctance that any one ventured a&s;hore to look for refre&s;hments. This i&s;land they called Recreation, on account of its &s;alutary herbs, and it is placed in lat. 16 deg. S. and in long. 285 deg. The natives were of the middle &s;ize, but &s;trong and well made, lively, and of a bold undaunted &s;pirit. Their bodies were painted, and covered with a kind of net, which they wrapt about them decently enough. The women were covered from head to foot with a very pretty &s;tuff that felt &s;oft like &s;ilk; their complexion was dark, with &s;hining black hair, very white teeth, and brilliant eyes; and to &s;ailors who had long been at &s;ea they were not a little inviting. The third day after they left this i&s;land, they fell in with &s;everal i&s;lands at
<PB N="l" REF="66">
once, to which they gave the name of Bauman's I&s;lands, where the inhabitants were altogether as courteous and civil as tho&s;e they had left had been treacherous and cruel. They came and trafficked with great good nature and hone&s;ty, and were to appearance as fair and beautiful as tho&s;e in the mo&s;t celebrated parts of Europe. They now thought them&s;elves near the i&s;lands which Dampier has named New Britain; but it was many days &s;ail before they came in &s;ight of them, in which interval the &s;curvy made dreadful havock. The &s;ailors were very de&s;ir|ous of &s;taying in the&s;e i&s;lands to refre&s;h, and to recover their &s;trength; but the Commander, who had other views, pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to the Ea&s;t Indies with all imaginable di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Thus, all this grand expedition, by which the expectations of the Commander in Chief and his employers had been rai&s;ed to a very high pitch, came to nothing. The men were di&s;&s;a|tisfied with their officers for going &s;o far, and the officers with their Commander for not go|ing farther. The exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern con|tinent &s;till remained as doubtful as ever; and &s;o it continues at this period, June 22, 1774.</P>
<P>Since the above was written, the Adventure, who accompanied Capt. Cook in the Re&s;olu|tion on a new voyage, is arrived, and reports, that they had &s;ailed between the 55th and 67th degrees of &s;outh latitude, but had found no land; &s;o that if any land lies farther to the &s;outhward, it mu&s;t be uninhabitable.</P>

<HEAD><PB REF="68">SIR FRANCIS DRAKE's VOYAGES, PARTICULARLY THAT ROUND THE WORLD, In 1577, 1578, 1579, and 1580.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the relation of the particular Voyages that characterize the navigators who fir&s;t &s;urrounded the globe, and who immortalized their names by their &s;kill and their courage, it may be expected, that we &s;hould give &s;ome account of their families and fir&s;t &s;etting out, the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of genius that led them to prefer the fatigues and dangers of a &s;ea-faring life to learned ea&s;e, or the calm pur&s;uit of le&s;s hazardous employments; and that we &s;hould trace the &s;teps by which they ro&s;e to eminence by their bravery and their conduct.</P>
<P>The bare narration of the incidents recorded in a &s;ingle voyage, however memorable, would convey but a very imperfect knowledge of the general character of tho&s;e renowned heroes, who carried the glory of their country to the remote&s;t regions of the earth. We &s;hall, therefore, endeavour to follow them as they advance to fame, and accompany them from their highe&s;t elevation to that period when all di&s;tinctions are levelled.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="69">The celebrated mariner, of whom we are now to give an account, was &s;on to Edmund Drake, a gentleman of Tavi&s;toke, in Devon&s;hire, who, being inclined to the doctrine of the Prote&s;|tants, at that time much oppo&s;ed by Q. Mary, was obliged to quit his place of re&s;idence, and retire to Medway, in Kent; where, after that Queen's death, he was fir&s;t appointed Chaplain in the royal navy, and afterwards Vicar of Upnor. In the&s;e employments, his income being &s;mall, and his family large, he owed the education of &s;everal of his children to the kindne&s;s of his relations, and that, in particu|lar of Francis, the elde&s;t of twelve, to Sir John Hawkins; under whom, as it appears, he very early di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, and laid the foundation both of his fame and his fortune.</P>
<P>The learned Camden, indeed, informs us, that he was put apprentice to the ma&s;ter of a &s;mall trading ve&s;&s;el, in who&s;e &s;ervice he behaved &s;o well, that his ma&s;ter, dying a batchelor, left him his ve&s;&s;el as a reward for his diligence: but Stowe, who &s;eems better informed, repre|&s;ents him in a &s;uperior light; tells us, that Francis Ru&s;&s;el, afterwards Duke of Bedford, was his godfather; and that Sir John Hawkins was his near relation. What Camden relates of Francis may, however, be true of his brother; for there were no le&s;s than four who were bred to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, the fir&s;t enterprize of
<PB N="3" REF="70">
con&s;equence, in which we find him engaged, was in a voyage to the We&s;t Indies, as Captain of the Judith, under his relation already men|tioned. Tho&s;e i&s;lands, having but lately been di&s;covered, and very little frequented by the Engli&s;h, were thought &s;o much to abound in wealth, that no voyager thither could fail of being recompen&s;ed with great advantages. No|thing was talked of among the mercantile or adventurous part of mankind but the beauty and riches of the new world. Fre&s;h di&s;coveries were frequently made; new countries and nati|ons, never heard of before, were daily de&s;cribed; and it may ea&s;ily be concluded, that the relators did not le&s;&s;en the merit of their di&s;coveries, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing or dimini&s;hing any circum&s;tance that might produce wonder, or excite curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>This was the age of enterprize and di&s;covery; and her Maje&s;ty encouraged the ardour of her &s;ubjects, by furni&s;hing &s;hips and commi&s;&s;ions to &s;uch officers of di&s;tinction in her royal navy as were willing to engage in hazardous pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The projects, however, that were formed, were not always &s;ucce&s;sfully carried into execu|tion; they were frequently defeated by the ig|norance of the adventurers, but more often by the malice of the Spaniards, who, from the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, con&s;idered every other nation that attempted to follow them, as in|vaders of their rights, and incroachers upon <HI>their</HI> territories. At that time, however, as now, it was no uncommon thing for tho&s;e who went
<PB N="4" REF="71">
in &s;earch of new di&s;coveries, to carry on a kind of contraband trade with the new &s;ettlers; which, tho' prohibited by the Crown of Spain, was yet countenanced by the Viceroys and Governors: but even the&s;e would &s;ometimes take advantage of the power lodged in their hands, and make prize of the profits which they them&s;elves had been the means of enhancing, under pretence that tho&s;e profits had been obtained by an illicit trade.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who &s;uffered mo&s;t by the inju&s;|tice of the Viceroys, was Sir John Hawkins; who, having &s;truck out a new trade, highly ad|vantageous to the parties concerned, though di&s;graceful to humanity, &s;upplied the Mexican Spaniards with &s;laves from Africa, and received from them, in return, large remittances in gold and &s;ilver. This was connived at, though we do not find that it was ab&s;olutely tolerated, by the Spani&s;h court.</P>
<P>It was, however, after one of tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful voyages, in which we find two of the Queen's &s;hips engaged (namely, the Je&s;us, commanded by Hawkins, as Admiral; and the Minion, of which Captain John Hampton was Commander; with four other armed trading &s;hips, among which was the Judith, Captain Drake), that, being driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into the port of St. John d'Ulloa, in the bay of Mexico, they were there waiting for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, when the Spani&s;h fleet from Europe arrived, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 &s;ail, richly laden with European merchan|dize, and on board of which was a new Viceroy.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="72">As the port was then ab&s;olutely in the power of the Engli&s;h, it was debated, among the prin|cipal officers, whether the Spani&s;h fleet &s;hould be &s;uffered to enter; as Admiral Hawkins &s;u&s;|pected, that, if they were admitted, they would contrive &s;ome means of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him; and yet if they were not, they mu&s;t peri&s;h at &s;ea; an event that would certainly bring on a war, which he, as a private trader, could by no means ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Upon mature deliberation, it was, therefore, judged &s;afe&s;t to propo&s;e an agreement with the Viceroy, to which he con&s;ented, and by which it was &s;tipulated, that the Engli&s;h &s;hould hold one &s;ide of the harbour, and the Spaniards the other; and that ho&s;tages &s;hould be given on both &s;ides, that no injury &s;hould be done to either. But it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that, though on the part of the Engli&s;h, &s;ix gentlemen were &s;ent, yet, on that of the Spaniards, the ho&s;tages were only common men, finely dre&s;&s;ed. This gave cau&s;e of di&s;tru&s;t; yet the Engli&s;h, naturally hone&s;t, were not &s;ufficiently on their guard.</P>
<P>The Spaniards for &s;ome weeks behaved with &s;eeming cordiality; mutual civilities pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the officers of both nations; and the Engli&s;h, having &s;upplied their wants, were pre|paring to depart, when, all of a &s;udden, at a &s;ig|nal given, the Spaniards a&s;&s;aulted their &s;hips as the officers were at dinner, boarded the Minion by a concealed ambu&s;cade, which, however, was repul&s;ed with lo&s;s, and then a general ma&s;&s;acre
<PB N="6" REF="73">
en&s;ued. The Engli&s;h who were on &s;hore were all put to death; three of the four trading &s;hips were pre&s;ently &s;unk; and the Minion and Je&s;us were &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed by their moorings, that it was al|mo&s;t a whole hour before they could be placed in a po&s;ture of defence; which, however, was at la&s;t effected. They then returned the attack with &s;o much fury, that the Spani&s;h Vice-Admiral was &s;oon blown up, and in her peri&s;hed 300 men; and not long after the Spani&s;h Admiral him&s;elf was &s;unk. The Spaniards, in revenge, &s;et two of their &s;hips on fire to burn the Minion and Je|&s;us, the fir&s;t of which &s;et &s;ail and e&s;caped; but the Je&s;us, after &s;hifting the Admiral with his crew on board the Judith, fell a victim with the re&s;t to Spani&s;h treachery.</P>
<P>In the night, the Judith having made her e&s;cape, endeavoured, but in vain, to join the Minion; and being only a bark of 50 tons, alone, on a ho&s;tile coa&s;t, crouded with men, and having barely pro|vi&s;ions on board for her own &s;lender company, a mutiny aro&s;e among the mariners, and by far the greate&s;t number in&s;i&s;ted on being put on &s;hore, chu&s;ing rather to take their chance among the &s;avages than to remain on board to &s;tarve at &s;ea, or again to fall into the power of the mer|cile&s;s Spaniards.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Capt. Hawkins gave every man his choice, either to land on the continent, or &s;ail with him, and &s;hare his fate. About 100 of the &s;toute&s;t &s;eamen cho&s;e the former; of whom five only lived to return to England. The&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="74">
gave an account, that, on their landing, the na|tives, mi&s;taking them for Spaniards, fell upon them &s;uddenly, and killed eight of their num|ber; that, after they were known to be enemies to the Spaniards, they were u&s;ed with kindne&s;s; that, however, being tired of living among &s;a|vages, they agreed to part, and to &s;eek the means of returning home. Some directed their cour&s;e to the northward, and the&s;e watching the oppor|tunity, &s;eized a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and, cro&s;&s;ing the Gulph, traver&s;ed an immen&s;e tract of land, till they arrived at a French &s;ettlement on the nor|thern continent. Others travelled we&s;tward; and of the&s;e, which were by far the greate&s;t part, &s;ixty-five fell into the hands of the Spa|niards, and &s;uffered various torments from the Inqui&s;ition, three were burnt alive, and two on|ly &s;urvived to reach their own country. Of tho&s;e who followed the northern cour&s;e, five found means, after enduring incredible hard&s;hips, to get to Nova Scotia, of whom three were brought &s;afe to England in French merchants &s;hips.</P>
<P>It was in the above engagement that Captain Drake fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; and to his judicious conduct, that tho&s;e who e&s;caped from the Je&s;us owed their pre&s;ervation. The Judith had the good fortune to arrive &s;afe in England, having purcha&s;ed &s;ome provi&s;ions on the I&s;land of Cuba; but what became of the Minion we have not been able to learn.</P>
<P>In this expedition Sir John Hawkins lo&s;t an immen&s;e &s;um. It was in vain to make complaint
<PB N="8" REF="75">
to his &s;overeign of the infraction of the peace. The Spani&s;h mini&s;ter vindicated the inju&s;tice of the Viceroy; and the Queen, tho' &s;he &s;ecretly re|&s;ented the lo&s;s of her &s;hips, could not openly abett the illicit trade carried on by her &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Drake, who &s;hared in the misfortune of his relation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both his &s;pirit and his indu&s;try. He did not &s;it down to lament the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;|tained; but, having acquired &s;ome degree of cre|dit by his gallant behaviour, and &s;ome knowledge of the weakne&s;s and wealth of his plunderers, he determined to profit by his lo&s;&s;es, and to make repri&s;als whenever a fair opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>It was no difficult matter to engage new adven|turers in new projects in tho&s;e early days of Mex|ican commerce, and Drake was not long before he rai&s;ed a fund to begin trade on a new footing. In 1570, he made his fir&s;t expedition, chiefly on his own account, with two &s;hips, the Dragon and the Swan; and the next year in the Swan alone; in both which voyages he enlarged his experience, but it does not appear that he repaired his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In 1572 he found means, however, to fit out a much greater force, in order to carry into ex|ecution an enterpri&s;e which he had meditated, not only to rein&s;tate his fortune, but to revenge the treachery of his enemies.</P>
<P>About this time war was agitating between England and Spain, to which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed the illicit trade carried on to the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements not a little contributed. He, there|fore, &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth in the Pa&s;cha, a
<PB N="9" REF="76">
letter of marque &s;hip, of 70 tons, accompanied by the Swan, of 50 tons, the command of which he entru&s;ted to his brother John; in both which &s;hips he had embarked 73 choice men, with a year's provi&s;ions, and &s;uch warlike &s;tores and ammunition as he judged nece&s;&s;ary for the enterprize he had in view. He had, likewi&s;e, the precaution to take with him the frames of two or three &s;mall pinnaces, that, if any accident &s;hould befal either of his larger &s;hips, he might have it in his power to pre&s;erve the crew with|out being driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving any of them behind; a precaution which experience had taught him in the unfortunate expedition of his kin&s;man Sir John. But this was not the only u&s;e for which he fore&s;aw the&s;e &s;mall ve&s;&s;els would be wanted, as will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>With this warlike force, incon&s;iderable as it may now appear, he cleared the land of Eng|land on the 12th of May, 1572; and, the wea|ther continuing fair, and the wind favourable, on the 29th of June he pa&s;&s;ed between Domi|nica and Guadaloupe, and on the 6th of July came in &s;ight of the high land of Santa Martha; then continuing his cour&s;e to the &s;outhward, on the 15th of the &s;ame month both &s;hips ar|rived at Port Phea&s;ant, which lay at a conve|nient di&s;tance from Nombre de Dios, the place of their de&s;tination.</P>
<P>Here he propo&s;ed to build his pinnaces, and was going a-&s;hore with a few men unarmed;
<PB N="10" REF="77">
when, di&s;covering a &s;moke at a di&s;tance, he made the &s;ignal for another boat to follow him w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th an armed force. Being joined by this re|inforcement, he matched towards the fire, where he found a plate of lead nailed to a tree, with an in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ription engraven upon it by one Garret, an Engli&s;hman, who had left that place a day or two before, and had taken that method of informing him that the Spaniards had been ad|vertized of his intended vi&s;it, and of his rendez|vous at that port; and that, therefore, it would be prudent for him to make but a very &s;hort &s;tay.</P>
<P>Drake, &s;urprized, no doubt, at the news, but at the &s;ame time knowing how convenient this place was for his de&s;igns, and con&s;idering that the hazard, and wa&s;te of time, which could not be avoided in &s;eeking another &s;tation, was equi|valent to any other danger which was to be apprehended from the Spaniards, determined to follow his fir&s;t re&s;olution; only, for his greater &s;ecurity, he ordered a kind of fort to be made, by felling a number of large trees, and laying the trunks and branches one acro&s;s another, on an elevated &s;pot that commanded the river, which, in ca&s;e of an attack, might enable him to repel any ordinary force which the Spaniards were likely to order out again&s;t him. This done, he &s;et the carpenters to work; and while they were employed in putting the frames of the pinnaces together, one Captain Rau&s;e happened to touch at the &s;ame port, with a bark of 50 men. To Rau&s;e Drake imparted his de&s;ign, and
<PB N="11" REF="78">
&s;ollicited his concurrence, to which he con&s;ent|ed; and, when the pinnaces were ready, both &s;et &s;ail together, &s;haping their cour&s;e to Nombre de Dios. They touch'd at the I&s;land of Pines, where they were informed, by the negroes they found there, that the inhabitants of that place were in daily expectation of &s;ome &s;oldiers, which the Go|vernor of Panama had promi&s;ed to &s;end, to de|fend them from the Symerons, or fugitive ne|groes, who, having e&s;caped from the tyranny of their ma&s;ters, had &s;ettled them&s;elves under two kings, or leaders, on each &s;ide the neck of land which parted Nombre de Dios from Panama; and not only a&s;&s;erted their natural right to liberty and independance, but endeavoured to revenge the cruelties they had &s;uffered, and had lately put the inhabitants of Nombre de Dios into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The&s;e negroes the Captain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> on &s;hore on the main land, &s;o that they might, by joining the Symerons, recover their liberty; or, if they preferred &s;lavery to independance, they might not have it in their power to apprize the people of Nombre de Dios of his intention to invade them, as by their di&s;tance, and their want of every means of communication, it mu&s;t be long before they could convey them intelli|gence. Then, &s;electing 53 men from his own company, and 20 from the crew of his new a&s;&s;o|ciate Captain Rau&s;e, he embarked with them in his new pinnaces, and &s;et &s;ail for Nombre de Dios.</P>
<P>On July the 28th, at night, he approached the town undi&s;covered, and dropt his anchors
<PB N="12" REF="79">
under the &s;hore, intending, after his men were refre&s;hed, to begin the attack; but, finding that they were terrifying each other with formi|dable accounts of the &s;trength of the place, and the multitude of the inhabitants, he deter|mined to hinder the panic from &s;preading, by leading them immediately to action; and, there|fore, ordering them to their oars, he landed without any oppo&s;ition, there being only one gunner upon the key, though it was fortified by &s;ix bra&s;s cannon of the large&s;t &s;ize. But the gunner, while they were employed in throwing the cannon from their carriages, alarmed the town, as they &s;oon di&s;covered by the bells, the drums, and the noi&s;e of the people.</P>
<P>Drake, leaving twelve men to guard the pin|naces, marched into the town with little or no oppo&s;ition. The forces that the alarm had ha&s;tily drawn together were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, ex|cept a few whom he detained as pri&s;oners, in order to &s;hew him the Governor's hou&s;e, and al&s;o the &s;tore-hou&s;e, where the mules that bring the &s;ilver from Panama were u&s;ually unloaded.</P>
<P>Being now in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, he po&s;ted the main of his &s;mall body, under the command of his brother, in the market-place; and then followed the guides, with the re&s;t, to the &s;tore-hou&s;e; where, forcing the door, and entering the room where the &s;ilver was depo&s;ited, they found it heaped up in bars, in &s;uch quan|tities, as almo&s;t exceed belief, the pile being, as they conjectured, &s;eventy feet in length, ten
<PB N="13" REF="80">
in breadth, and twelve in height, each bar weighing between thirty and forty-five pounds. It is ea&s;y to imagine, that, at the &s;ight of this trea&s;ure, nothing was thought of, by the Eng|li&s;h &s;ailors, but by what means it might be&s;t be conveyed to their boats; and, doubtle&s;s, it was not ea&s;y for Drake (who, con&s;idering their di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and the number of their enemies, was afraid of being intercepted in their retreat) to hinder his men from encumbering them&s;elves with &s;o much &s;ilver as might have retarded their march, and ob&s;tructed the u&s;e of their weapons: however, by promi&s;ing to lead them to the King's trea&s;ury, where there were gold and jewels to a far greater value, and where the plunder was not only more portable, but nearer the &s;hore, he per&s;uaded them to follow him (not, however, without every man his bar), and rejoin the main body in the market-place. Here he found his little troop much di&s;couraged by the apprehen&s;ion, that if they &s;tayed any longer, the enemy might gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pinnaces, and that they &s;hould then, without any means of retreat, be left to &s;tand alone again&s;t the whole force of that country. Drake, not indeed ea&s;ily terrified, but &s;ufficiently cau|tious, &s;ent to the harbour to examine the ground of their fears, and to learn if the &s;ame panic had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the men whom he had left to guard his boats; but, finding no foun|dation for the&s;e dreadful apprehen&s;ions, he per|&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t de&s;ign, and led the troop for|ward
<PB N="14" REF="81">
to the royal trea&s;ury. In their way there fell a violent &s;hower of rain, which wet &s;ome of their bow-&s;trings, and extingui&s;hed many of their matches (&s;pring-locks for mu&s;kets not be|ing then invented); a misfortune which might &s;oon have been repaired, and which, perhaps, the enemy might &s;uffer in common with them; but which, however, on this occa&s;ion, very much embarra&s;&s;ed them, as the delay produced by it repre&s;&s;ed that ardour which, &s;ometimes, is only to be kept up by continued action.</P>
<P>It was in vain for Drake to expo&s;tulate, or to repre&s;ent the di&s;grace of returning in rags, after having the chief trea&s;ure of the world within their power; he therefore reproached their cow|ardice, &s;et before their eyes the imminent dan|ger to which they would inevitably be expo&s;ed, if they failed to behave like men anxious for glory, and zealous for the honour of their country. Animated by the&s;e incentives, they re&s;umed their former &s;pirit, and, pu&s;hing bri&s;kly forward, the whole company followed till they arrived at the trea&s;ury, which they in&s;tantly forced. Having thus far &s;ucceeded, Drake committed the care of the riches to his brother, and Oxenham, of Plymouth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man made him&s;elf remarkable by one of the bolde&s;t undertakings that ever was devi&s;ed&punc; As &s;oon as he arrived in England, with the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ze-money acquired in this expedition, he purcha&s;ed a bark of 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tons, and manned it with 70 brave &s;eamen; with the&s;e he &s;ailed to the I&s;thmus of Darien, and, laying his bark up in a creek, marched cro&s;s the neck of land which &s;eparates the North Sea from the great Pacific Ocean, where he arrived, with his com|panions, without being di&s;covered; and, having there &s;eized a &s;hip for their purpo&s;e, they ranged the coa&s;t, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of an immen&s;e trea&s;ure; but, falling out among them&s;elves, they &s;eparated; and, thus weakened, they became an ea&s;y prey to the Spaniards, who recovered their trea&s;ure; and Oxenham being taken, with tho&s;e that continued with him, and having no commi&s;&s;ion to produce, both he and his companions were executed as pirates. When they parted, they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion two &s;hips laden with gold, to the amount of half a million &s;terling.</NOTE>, (a man known
<PB N="15" REF="82">
afterwards for his bold adventures in the &s;ame parts) while he, with the main body, &s;hould again return and reconnoitre the market-place, and di&s;per&s;e any parties of the Spaniards that might be forming into a body to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s. With this view, as he was advancing, his &s;trength &s;uddenly failed him, and he fell down &s;peechle&s;s.</P>
<P>Then it was that his companions perceived a wound in his leg, that he received in entering the town, but had hitherto concealed, le&s;t his men, ea&s;ily di&s;couraged, &s;hould make their concern for his life a pretence for returning to their boats. Such, however, had been his lo&s;s of blood, as was di&s;covered upon nearer ob&s;erva|tion, that it had filled the prints of his foot|&s;teps; and it appeared &s;carce credible, that, after &s;uch an effu&s;ion, life &s;hould remain. The brave&s;t were now willing to retire; neither de|&s;ire of honour, or of riches, was thought to prevail in any man over the regard for his life,
<PB N="16" REF="83">
that of Drake being already given over for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But Drake, whom cordials had re&s;tored to his &s;en&s;es, was the only man who could not be prevailed on to leave the enterprize unfini&s;hed. It was to no purpo&s;e that they advi&s;ed him to go on board to have his wound dre&s;&s;ed. He well knew how impracticable it was to regain the opportunity when it was once lo&s;t, and could ea&s;ily fore&s;ee, that a re&s;pite of but a few hours would enable the Spaniards to recover from their con&s;ternation, to a&s;&s;emble their forces, refit their batteries, and remove their trea&s;ure. What he had undergone &s;o much danger to obtain, was now in his hands, and the thoughts of leaving it untouched was too mortifying to be patiently borne; however, as there was little time for con&s;ultation, and the &s;ame danger attended their &s;tay in that perplexity and confu&s;ion, as their return, they bound up his wound with his &s;carf, and, partly by force, partly by intreaty, they carried him back to the boats, in which, with what trea&s;ure they were able to bring off, they all embarked by break of day. Then taking with them, out of the harbour, a &s;loop laden with wines, they went to the Ba&s;timento's, an i&s;land about a league from the town, where they &s;taid two days, to recover the wounded men who had been hurt in the fir&s;t rencounter, and to regale them&s;eves with the wines they had taken, and with the fruits that grew in great plenty in the gardens of that i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="84">During their &s;tay here, there came over to that i&s;land a Spani&s;h gentleman, &s;ent by the Governor with in&s;tructions to inquire, whether the Captain was that Drake who had before been on their coa&s;t; whether the arrows with which many of their men were wounded were not poi&s;oned; and whether they wanted provi|&s;ions or other nece&s;&s;aries? The me&s;&s;enger, like|wi&s;e, extolled their courage with the highe&s;t encomiums, and expre&s;&s;ed his admiration of their daring undertaking. Drake, though he knew the civilities of an enemy are always to be &s;u&s;pected, and that the me&s;&s;enger, amid&s;t all his profe&s;&s;ions of regard, was no other than a &s;py, yet knowing that he had nothing to appre|hend, treated him with the highe&s;t honours that his condition admitted of. In an&s;wer to his in|quiries, he a&s;&s;ured him, that he was the &s;ame Drake with who&s;e character they were before acquainted; that he was a rigid ob&s;erver of the laws of war, and that he never permitted the arrows di&s;charged by his followers to be poi|&s;oned. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with con&s;iderable pre|&s;ents; and told him, that, though he had in part failed in this attempt, he would never de|&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign of revenging the treachery of the Viceroy of Mexico, till he had &s;hared with Spain the trea&s;ures of America.</P>
<P>He then re&s;olved to return to the I&s;le of Pines, where they had left their &s;hips, and to con&s;ult about the mea&s;ures they were now to take; and, having arrived on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="85">
at their former &s;tation, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Captain Rau&s;e, who, judging it un&s;afe to &s;tay any longer on the coa&s;t, de&s;ired to be no farther engaged in their de&s;igns. But Drake, not to be diverted from his purpo&s;e, after being cured of his wound, inquired of a negroe, whom he took on board at Nombre de Dios, the mo&s;t wealthy &s;ettlements, and weake&s;t parts of the coa&s;t. This man recommended Carthagena as the mo&s;t wealthy, and, being the mo&s;t powerful, the lea&s;t upon its guard. The Admiral &s;eemed to approve the man's notion, and, &s;etting &s;ail without lo&s;s of time, came to anchor, Aug. 13, between Charecha (&s;ince called Boca Chica) and St. Barnard's, two i&s;lands at a little di&s;tance from the harbour of Carthagena. Then pa&s;&s;ing with his boats round the i&s;land, he entered the harbour, and in the mouth of it found a frigate with only an old man in it, who voluntarily informed him, that, about an hour before a pinnace had pa&s;&s;ed by, with &s;ails and oars, and all the appearance of expedition and import|ance; that, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, the crew on board her bid him take care of him&s;elf; and that, as &s;oon as &s;he touched the &s;hore, he heard the noi&s;e of cannon, fired as a warning, and &s;aw the &s;hipping of the port drawn up under the guns of the ca&s;tle. The Captain, who had him&s;elf heard the di&s;charge of the artillery, was &s;oon convinced that he was di&s;covered; and that, therefore, nothing could be attempted there with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. He there|fore
<PB N="19" REF="86">
contented him&s;elf with taking a &s;hip of Seville, of 240 tons (which the relator of this voyage mentions as a very large &s;hip), and two &s;mall frigates, in which he found letters of ad|vice from Nombre de Dios, intended to alarm that part of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Drake, now finding his pinnaces of great u&s;e, and not having a &s;ufficient number of &s;ailors for all his ve&s;&s;els, was de&s;irous of de&s;troying the Swan, the &s;hip commanded by his brother, that the others might be better manned. This, nece&s;&s;ary as it was, could not ea&s;ily be effected without di&s;gu&s;ting the officers on board her, who, lo&s;ing their commi&s;&s;ions, would naturally be aver&s;e to her de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Drake knew that nothing but the love of their leaders could animate his followers to en|counter &s;uch hard&s;hips as he was about to ex|po&s;e them to; and, therefore, rather cho&s;e to bring his de&s;igns to pa&s;s by artifice than by au|thority. He &s;ent for the carpenter of the Swan, took him into his cabin, and, having fir&s;t en|gaged him to &s;ecrecy, ordered him, in the mid|dle of the night, to go down into the well, and bore five holes through the bottom, laying &s;omething again&s;t them that might hinder the bubbling of the water from being heard. To this the carpenter, after &s;ome expo&s;tulation, con&s;ented, and the next night performed his promi&s;e. In the morning, Augu&s;t the 15th, Drake, going out with his pinnace a-fi&s;hing, rowed up to the Swan; and, having invited his
<PB N="20" REF="87">
brother to partake of his diver&s;ion, inquired, with a negligent air, why the Swan was &s;o deep in the water? Upon which, his brother, being alarmed, &s;ent down his &s;teward to learn the cau&s;e, who returned immediately, with an account that the &s;hip was leaky, and in danger of &s;inking in a very little time. They had in&s;tantly recour&s;e to the pump; but, having laboured for five hours, and gained very little upon the water, they wil|lingly, according to Drake's advice, &s;et the ve&s;|&s;el on fire, and went on board the Pa&s;cha.</P>
<P>Finding it now nece&s;&s;ary to lie concealed for &s;ome time, till the Spaniards &s;hould forget their danger, and remit their vigilance, they &s;et &s;ail for the &s;ound of Darien, and, without ap|proaching the coa&s;t, that their cour&s;e might not be ob&s;erved, they arrived there in &s;ix days.</P>
<P>This being a convenient place for their re|ception, both on account of privacy, it being out of the road of all trade, and as it was well &s;upplied with wood, water, wild-fowl, hogs, deer, and all kind of provi&s;ions, he &s;tayed here fifteen days, to careen his ve&s;&s;els, and refre&s;h his men, who worked interchangeably, on one day the one half, and on the next day the other half.</P>
<P>On the 5th of September, Drake left his brother with the &s;hip at Darien, and &s;et out with two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els towards the Rio Grand, which they reached in three days, and on the 9th of the &s;ame month were di&s;covered by a Spaniard from the land, who, believing them to be his countrymen, made a &s;ignal for them to come on &s;hore, with which they very readily
<PB N="21" REF="88">
complied; but he, &s;oon finding his mi&s;take, abandoned his plantation, where they found great plenty of provi&s;ions, with which, having laden their ve&s;&s;els, they departed.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his brother, Captain John Drake, went, according to the directions that had been left him, in &s;earch of the Symerons, or fugitive negroes, from who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they now entertained hopes of completing the &s;uc|ce&s;s of their voyage: and, touching upon the main land, by means of the negroes whom they had taken from Nombre de Dios, engaged two of the Symerons to come on board his &s;hip, leaving two of his own men as ho&s;tages for their &s;afe return. Tho&s;e men, having a&s;&s;ured him of the affection of their nation, appointed an inter|view between Drake and their leaders. With this appointment Drake being made acquaint|ed, he immediately quitted Port Plenty, &s;o named by the Engli&s;h from the great &s;tore of provi&s;ions they had ama&s;&s;ed at that place, and came, by the direction of the Symerons, into a &s;ecret bay, among beautiful i&s;lands covered with trees, which concealed their &s;hips from ob&s;ervation, and where the channel was &s;o nar|row and rocky that it was impo&s;&s;ible to enter it by night; &s;o that there was no danger of a &s;udden &s;urprize. Here they met, and entered into engagements, which common enemies and common dangers pre&s;erved from violation. But the fir&s;t conver&s;ation informed the Engli&s;h, that their expectations were not immediately to
<PB N="22" REF="89">
be gratified: for, upon their enquiries after the mo&s;t probable means of acquiring gold and &s;ilver, the Symerons told them, that, had they known &s;ooner the chief end of their expedition, they could ea&s;ily have gratified them; but that during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which was now be|gun, they could not recover the trea&s;ure they had taken from the Spaniards, out of the rivers in which they had concealed it. Drake, there|fore, propo&s;ing to wait in this place till the rains were pa&s;&s;ed, built, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Symerons, a fort of earth and timber; and, leaving his brother and part of his company to guard it, &s;et out with three pinnaces to|wards Rio de la Hacha, being of a &s;pirit too active to he &s;till patiently, even in a &s;tate of plenty and &s;ecurity, and with the mo&s;t probable expectations of immen&s;e riches.</P>
<P>In their way thither, they anchored within &s;ight of Carthagena without landing, and on the 17th of October took a Spani&s;h bark, with which they entered the harbour in di&s;gui&s;e; but were &s;oon acco&s;ted by a Spani&s;h gentle|man whom they had &s;ome time before taken and &s;et at liberty; who coming to them in a boat, as he pretended, without the knowledge of the Governor, made them great promi&s;es of friend&s;hip, and profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem. But Drake, having waited till next morning without receiving the great things he had been encou|raged to expect, found that all this pretended kindne&s;s was no more than a &s;tratagem to amu&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="90">
him, while the Governor was rai&s;ing forces for his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This appeared more clearly on the 20th, when two frigates, well armed and manned, came out in the night with a view to &s;urprize the pinnaces, and make pri&s;oner of Drake: but the&s;e being di&s;covered, and their de&s;ign fru&s;trated, Drake, when day-light approached, leapt intrepidly a&s;hore &s;ingle, in defiance of their troops, which hovered at a di&s;tance in the woods and on the hills, without ever venturing to advance within reach of the &s;hot from the pinnaces. To leap, however, upon an enemy's coa&s;t, in &s;ight of a &s;uperior force, only to &s;hew how little they were feared, was an act that in the&s;e times would meet with little applau&s;e: but motives of policy might influence the con|duct of Drake, and make that nece&s;&s;ary then which now appears a ridiculous bravado. Find|ing the whole country adverti&s;ed of his attempts, and in arms to oppo&s;e him, he might make a feint only of landing to increa&s;e their fears, and encourage their alarms, that they might keep together till he &s;hould a&s;&s;ault them in their de|&s;erted po&s;ts; a &s;tratagem which there is rea&s;on to think he put in practice, as he continued upon the coa&s;t till one of his ve&s;&s;els had only a gammon of bacon and a &s;mall quantity of bread on board for &s;eventeen men, and till there was on board his own ve&s;&s;el even a greater &s;carcity. But re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s recipro|cally produce each other. They had not &s;ailed
<PB N="24" REF="91">
more than three leagues on their return to their &s;hips before they fell in with and attacked a coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el, which after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance they took, and happily found it laden with excel|lent provi&s;ions. He now determined to return to the Symerons, with whom, as has been &s;aid, he left his brother, and part of his force. In conjunction with them, he had meditated an at|tempt to make his way over the I&s;thmus, and invade the Spaniards in the inland parts, where they probably never dreamt of an enemy.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Port Diego, &s;o named from the negroe who had procured them their intercour&s;e with the Symerons, they found Cap|tain John Drake and one of his company dead, being killed in an attempt, almo&s;t unarmed, to board a frigate, of which they had received intelli|gence, well provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary for its defence. The Captain was unwilling to make the attack, and repre&s;ented to his company the madne&s;s of their propo&s;al; but, being over-borne by their clamours and importunities, to avoid the imputation of cowardice, complied to his de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>But this was not the only misfortune that befel this little company; for &s;oon after many of them fell ill of the calenture, a malignant fever, very frequent in the hot climates, which carried off, among &s;everal others, Jo&s;eph Drake, another brother of the Commander.</P>
<P>While Drake was employed in the recovery of the &s;ick, the Symerons, who ranged the country for intelligence, brought him an account, that
<PB N="25" REF="92">
the Spani&s;h fleet was arrived at Nombre de Dios, the truth of which was confirmed by a pinnace which he &s;ent out to make ob&s;ervations. This, therefore, was the time for their journey, when the trea&s;ures of the Peruvian mines were to be tran&s;ported from Panama, over land, to Nom|bre de Dios. He therefore communicated his de&s;ign to the Symerons, reque&s;ted their ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and having obtained the promi&s;e of both, by their direction he procured all things nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and, on the third of February in the following year, &s;et out from Port Diego. Having already lo&s;t twenty-eight of his company, and being under the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving &s;ome to guard his &s;hip, he took with him only 18 Engli&s;h and 30 Sy|merons, who not only &s;erved as guards to &s;hew the way, but as carriers to convey the provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>They carried with them, be&s;ides, arrows for war, and arrows for hunting and fowling, the heads of which are proportioned in &s;ize to the game they pur&s;ue. For oxen, &s;tags, or wild boars, they have arrows or javelins with heads weighing a pound and a half, which they di&s;|charge near hand, and which &s;carcely ever fail of being mortal. Their &s;econd &s;ort are about half as heavy as the other, and are generally &s;hot from their bows; the&s;e are intended for &s;maller bea&s;ts. With the third &s;ort, of which the heads are an ounce in weight, they kill birds. As this nation is in a &s;tate which does not &s;et them above continual cares for the immediate
<PB N="26" REF="93">
nece&s;&s;aries of life, he that can temper iron be&s;t is among them mo&s;t e&s;teemed; and, per|haps, it would be happy for every nation, if honours and applau&s;es were as ju&s;tly di&s;tribu|ted, and he were mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed who&s;e ta|lents were mo&s;t u&s;eful to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Every day by &s;un-ri&s;ing they began to march, and having travelled till ten, re&s;ted near &s;ome river till twelve; then travelling again till four, they repo&s;ed all night in huts, or wigwams, which the Symerons had either left &s;tanding in their former marches, or very readily erected for them, by &s;etting up three or four po&s;ts in the ground, and laying poles from one to another, in the form of a roof, which they covered with palmetto boughs and plantain leaves. In the val|lies, where they were &s;heltered from the winds, they left three or four feet next the ground open; but, on the hills, where they were more expo&s;ed to the chill bla&s;ts of the night, they thatched them clo&s;e to the ground, leaving only a door for entrance, and a vent a-top in the middle for the &s;moke of the fire to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>In their march, they met not only with plenty of fruits upon the banks of the rivers, but with wild &s;wine in abundance, of which the Symerons without difficulty killed, for the mo&s;t part, as many as were wanted. One day, however, they found only an otter, and were about to dre&s;s it; at which Drake expre&s;&s;ing his wonder, was a&s;k|ed by Pedro, the chief Symeron, <Q REND="inline">"Are you a man of war, and in want, and yet doubt whe|ther
<PB N="27" REF="94">
this be meat that hath blood in it?"</Q> For which Drake in private rebuked him, &s;ays the relator; whether ju&s;tly or not, it is not very important to determine; only it &s;hews the ge|nius of the times when &s;uper&s;tition prevailed, and when the greate&s;t men were not wholly ex|empt from its influences.</P>
<P>On the third day of their march, and the 6th of February, they came to a town of the Syme|rons, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a hill, and encom|pa&s;&s;ed with a ditch and a mud wall, to &s;ecure it from any &s;udden &s;urprize. Here the inhabitants lived with great neatne&s;s, and in plenty; and with &s;ome ob&s;ervation of religion, paying great reverence to the cro&s;s; a practice which, the relator &s;ays, Drake prevailed upon them to change for the u&s;e of the Lord's Prayer; which, we cannot help remarking, is very unlikely in &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay. Indeed, it is added, that here they &s;trongly importuned Drake to prolong his abode, promi&s;ing to double his force; but he, either thinking greater numbers unnece&s;&s;ary, or fear|ing, that, if any difference &s;hould ari&s;e between them and his own men, he &s;hould be overborne by numbers, he prudently declined both their invitation, and their offer of additional a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, and that in &s;uch terms as expre&s;&s;ed his eagerne&s;s to engage, and his confidence of &s;uc|ce&s;s from the bravery of his followers.</P>
<P>The Symerons continued to conduct him on his journey, and led him through rural &s;hades and lofty woods, which &s;heltered his people &s;o effectually from the &s;un, that their march was
<PB N="28" REF="95">
le&s;s toil&s;ome than if they had travelled in Eng|land during the heat of &s;ummer. Four of the Symerons that were acquainted with the way, went about a mile before the main body, and cut off branches as marks to direct them, for there was no beaten track; then followed twelve Symerons, after whom came the Engli&s;h, with the two leaders; and the other Symerons clo&s;ed the rear. In this order, on the 11th of Fe|ruary, they arrived at the top of a very high hill, on the &s;ummit of which grew a tree of a won|derful height and magnitude, in which they had cut &s;teps for the more ea&s;y a&s;cent to the top, where there was a kind of alcove, to which they invited Drake, and from thence &s;hewed him not only the North Sea, from whence they came, but the great Pacific Ocean, on which no Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el had ever yet &s;ailed. This pro&s;pect exciting his natural curio&s;ity and ardour for adventures and di&s;coveries, he lifted up his hands to God, and implored his ble&s;&s;ing upon the re&s;olution which he that in&s;tant formed, of &s;ailing in an Engli&s;h &s;hip on that immen&s;e &s;ea.</P>
<P>From this &s;tupendous mountain they de|&s;cended, after having fea&s;ted their eyes with the grande&s;t pro&s;pect the earth can furni&s;h; and in two days came into an open level country, where their march was incommoded with the gra&s;s, which is of a peculiar kind, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;talk like that of a bull-ru&s;h, and a blade on which the oxen and other cattle feed till it grows too high for them to reach: then it is that the natives &s;et the whole on fire; and it is
<PB N="29" REF="96">
no uncommon thing to behold vallies of im|men&s;e extent in a blaze at once; from whence the cattle fly in the utmo&s;t terror, and many peri&s;h by the &s;udden conflagration. It might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this burning of the &s;oil, would, in a hot climate, check the powers of vegetation, and that it would be years before the earth could recover its fertility; but it is ju&s;t the con|trary; the a&s;hes or the reeds are hardly extin|gui&s;hed before a new verdu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e begins to appear; and before a month is elap&s;ed, the whole valley, beheld at a di&s;tance, looks as green as ever; &s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly wonderful are the powers of Na|ture on this happy &s;oil!</P>
<P>When they had arrived within a convenient di&s;tance of the road from Panama, they po&s;ted them&s;elves in a grove or wood, near which the trea&s;ure was to be conveyed from thence to Nombre de Dios. They then di&s;patched a tru&s;ty Symeron, in the habit of a &s;lave, properly in&s;tructed, to learn on what day the mules, on who&s;e backs the trea&s;ure is carried, were to &s;et out. The man was &s;o well qualified for the &s;ervice, and &s;o indu&s;trious in the pro&s;ecution of it, that he &s;oon returned with an account, that the trea&s;urer of Lima, intending to embark for Europe, would pa&s;s the night following with eight mules laden with gold, and one with jew|els; that it was their cu&s;tom to travel by night, and to re&s;t in the day, to avoid the heat; and that Venta Cruz was to be their fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>On this intelligence, they changed their to it, and immediately directed their march
<PB N="30" REF="97">
towards Venta Cruz, &s;ending, for &s;ecurity, two Symerons, habited as before, to examine the way, who, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, perceived, by the &s;cent of a match, that &s;ome Spaniard was before them; and creeping &s;ilently forward, &s;urprized a &s;oldier a&s;leep upon the ground. They bound him, without offering any other violence, and brought him to Drake, who, upon enquiry, found that their &s;py had not deceived them in his intelligence. The &s;oldier, having informed him&s;elf of the Captain's name, conceived &s;uch a dread of the vengeance he had threatened, that, after having made an ample di&s;covery of the trea&s;ure that was now at hand, cautioned them likewi&s;e again&s;t being deceived by the recoes, or carriers, from Nombre de Dios, who met the others by the way, and who were hourly ex|pected, with merchandize and provi&s;ions, but without any gold. He clo&s;ed his examination with an humble petition to Drake, to con&s;ider his &s;ituation, as liable to puni&s;hment by his country|men for his treachery; and to immediate death by the enemy, if he had refu&s;ed to make full confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ecrets with which he was en|tru&s;ted. He therefore reque&s;ted to be taken into his protection, and that, when the expected trea|&s;ure &s;hould fall into his hands, he would be gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow him as much of it as would maintain him&s;elf and his children during the re|mainder of their lives, &s;ince there would abun|dantly more arrive than he and his company could carry away. Drake agreed to his reque&s;t, upon con|dition that he led him to a place of &s;ecrecy, where
<PB N="31" REF="98">
he could conceal his men till the time of action, and where there was no danger of the mules pa&s;|&s;ing by without being perceived. This the man did; and Drake placed his ambu&s;h accordingly.</P>
<P>Before the time expected, the whole company were properly refre&s;hed and in&s;tructed. Oxenham was appointed to head the Symerons, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Pedro their leader; and Drake was to command the Engli&s;h. The parties were then divided; the Engli&s;h took the right of the way in front, and the Symerons the left at a &s;mall di&s;tance in the rear. In this manner they were po&s;ted, that one company might be in readine&s;s to &s;eize the hindmo&s;t mule at the &s;ame time that the other had &s;eized the foremo&s;t; for the mules, it &s;eems, being tied together, travel in a line, and are all guided by leading the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Every thing being now as well concerted as human prudence could fore&s;ee, and the critical moment of action being &s;oon expected, they lay down and covered them&s;elves in the gra&s;s at about eighty or ninety paces di&s;tance from the road, that the noi&s;e of their breathing might not be heard by the guard that convoy'd the trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>They had not been more than an hour in this &s;ituation, when the bells of the mules on the left, coming from Venta Cruz, began to be heard: but previous orders having been given to meddle only with tho&s;e from Panama, tho&s;e from Venta Cruz were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted. Un|fortunately, however, it happened, that one Robert Pike, being heated with liquor, pre|vailed upon the man that was next him to
<PB N="32" REF="99">
creep forward with him, in order to be in rea|dine&s;s to &s;ignalize them&s;elves, by being the fir&s;t to &s;eize the mules from Panama. At that in|&s;tant, an officer, who accompanied the recoes from Venta Cruz, perceiving &s;omething white moving in the gra&s;s (for Drake had ordered all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s company to put their &s;hirts over their clothes, to di&s;tingui&s;h them in the night,) took the alarm, and, from a walk, was ob&s;erved to pu&s;h his hor&s;e forward on a &s;mart trot; and, before he had pa&s;&s;ed the hindmo&s;t ambu&s;cade, he was heard to ride along in a full gallop; but neither Drake, who commanded the Engli&s;h, nor Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">m, who headed the Symerons, being apprized of the rea&s;on, had any thought of tak|ing mea&s;ures to intercept his journey.</P>
<P>It was not, however, long before the recoes from Panama came up, and were eagerly &s;eized by the Engli&s;h in front, and &s;ecured by the Symerons, as had been agreed upon, in the rear; but, to their great mortification, they found two of them only loaded with &s;ilver, and the re&s;t with provi&s;ions, &s;ix of tho&s;e from Pa|nama, which carried the valuable burdens of gold and jewels, being ordered back, and the like number that came from Venta Cruz &s;ent for|ward in their room. The drivers were brought immediately to the Captain, and examined, who informed him, that a hor&s;eman, riding in ha&s;te, had met them, and had talked with the trea&s;ur|er, and advi&s;ed him to &s;end back his gold and jewels, and &s;uffer tho&s;e only to proceed that were now in his [Drake's] power, that he might,
<PB N="33" REF="100">
by that cheap experiment, di&s;cover whether there were not (as he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect) &s;ome ambu&s;h in the way; or, whether his ap|prehen&s;ions might not betray him into vi&s;ionary fears, for which there was no real ground.</P>
<P>That Drake was not le&s;s enraged than his followers at this di&s;appointment cannot be doubt|ed; but there was now no time to be &s;pent in complaints. The whole country, he knew, would &s;oon be alarmed, and all the force of the Spaniards a&s;&s;embled to overwhelm him; he had no fortre&s;s to retire to; every man was his ene|my, and every road better known to the Spa|niards than to him&s;elf. This was an occa&s;ion that demanded all the qualities of an hero, an intrepidity never to be &s;haken, and a judgment never to be perplexed. He immediately con|&s;idered all the circum&s;tances of his pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, and found that it afforded him only the choice of marching back by the &s;ame way through which he came, or forcing his pa&s;&s;age through Venta Cruz. He fore&s;aw many diffi|culties in marching back, be&s;ides the hazard of having his &s;hips &s;eized before his return; he, therefore, determined to pa&s;s forwards to Venta Cruz, before the enemy could be prepared to oppo&s;e him. He a&s;ked Pedro, the leader of the Symerons, whether he would dare to follow him? and, having received from him the &s;trong|e&s;t a&s;&s;urance that nothing &s;hould &s;eparate them, he commanded his men to &s;et forwards. When they came to the gates of the town, they di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="34" REF="101">
the mules they had made u&s;e of to carry their prize, and continued their march with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; yet they di&s;covered, that not|with&s;tanding the utmo&s;t precaution had been u&s;ed, the alarm had been &s;pread, and the forces of the town ha&s;tily drawn together, to oppo&s;e their entrance. Drake, who was not unac|quainted with the behaviour of that kind of town militia, received their fir&s;t on&s;et, and then breaking in upon them, drove them before him without farther oppo&s;ition, and was &s;econded by the Symerons, who could not be re&s;trained from making plunder of the town: but Drake ha&s;tened in per&s;on to the Spani&s;h ladies, and a&s;&s;ured them that no injuries &s;hould be offered to them, nor was there the lea&s;t indecency per|mitted; and the forces of the Spaniards being di&s;per&s;ed, he continued his march to the &s;hips without any apprehen&s;ion of danger, yet with great &s;peed, being very &s;olicitous about the &s;tate of the crew; &s;o that he allowed his men, har|ra&s;&s;ed as they were, but little time for &s;leep or refre&s;hment. By kind exhortations, gentle au|thority, and a chearful participation of all their hard&s;hips, he prevailed upon them to bear with|out murmur, not only the toil of travelling, but, on &s;ome days, the pain of hunger. In this march, he owed much of his expedition to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Symerons, who, being ac|cu&s;tomed to the climate, and naturally robu&s;t, when any of the Engli&s;h fainted by the way, two of them would carry him between them for
<PB N="35" REF="102">
miles together. Nor was their valour le&s;s than their humanity, after they had learned from their Engli&s;h companions to de&s;pi&s;e the fire|arms of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>When they were within five leagues of the &s;hips, they found a town built in their ab&s;ence by the Symerons, at which Drake con&s;ented to halt, &s;ending a Symeron to the &s;hips with his gold toothpick as a token, which, though the ma&s;ter knew it, was not &s;ufficient to gain the me&s;&s;enger credit, till, upon examination, he found that the Captain, having ordered him to regard no me&s;&s;age without his hand-writing, had engraven his name upon it with the point of his knife; the ma&s;ter then &s;ent the pinnace up the river to meet the Captain, and after|wards &s;ent to the town for tho&s;e who&s;e wearine&s;s had made them unable to march farther.</P>
<P>On February the 23d, the whole company was re-united; and Drake, who&s;e good or ill &s;ucce&s;s never prevailed over his &s;hew of piety, celebrated their meeting with thanks to God.</P>
<P>Drake, not yet di&s;couraged, &s;oon turned his thoughts to new projects; and, without lan|gui&s;hing in melancholy reflections upon pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, employed him&s;elf in forming &s;chemes for repairing them. Eager of action, and acquainted with man's nature, he never &s;uffered idlene&s;s to infect his followers with cowardice; but kept them from &s;inking under any di&s;appointment, by directing their attention to &s;ome new enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="103">Upon con&s;ultation with his own men, and the Symerons, he found them divided in their opi|nions; &s;ome declaring, that, before they engag|ed in any new attempt, it was nece&s;&s;ary to in|crea&s;e their &s;tores of provi&s;ions; and others urging that the &s;hips, in which the Spani&s;h trea|&s;ure was embarked, &s;hould be immediately at|tempted. The Symerons propo&s;ed a third plan, and advi&s;ed them to undertake another journey over-land, to the hou&s;e of one Pezaro, near Ve|ragua, who&s;e &s;laves brought him every day more than 200 pounds &s;terling from the mines, which he heaped together in a &s;trong &s;tone hou&s;e, that might, by the help of the Engli&s;h, be ea&s;ily forced. But Drake, being unwilling to fatigue his followers with another journey over-land, determined to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e between the&s;e variable opinions; and, manning his two pinnaces, the Bear and the Minion, he &s;ent John Oxenham in the Bear towards Tolu, to &s;eek provi&s;ions; and went him&s;elf in the Minion to the Cabezes, to endeavour to inter|cept the trea&s;ure that was to be tran&s;ported from Veragua and that coa&s;t, to the fleet at Nombre de Dios; fir&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ing with pre&s;ents tho&s;e Symerons who de&s;ired to return to their wives, and ordering tho&s;e that cho&s;e to remain with him to be kindly entertained. Drake took at the Cabezes a frigate of Veragua, the pilot of which informed him, that there was in the harbour of Veragua a &s;hip freighted with more than a million of gold; to which he of|fered
<PB N="37" REF="104">
to conduct him, being well acquainted with the &s;oundings, if he might be allowed his &s;hare of the prize; &s;o much was his avarice &s;u|perior to his hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>Drake, after &s;ome deliberation, complying with the pilot's conditions, &s;ailed towards the harbour; but had no &s;ooner entered the mouth of it than he heard the report of artillery, which was an&s;wered by others at a greater di&s;tance; upon which the pilot told them that they were di&s;covered, this being the &s;ignal appointed by the Governor to alarm the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Drake now thought it convenient to return to the &s;hips, that he might enquire the &s;ucce&s;s of the other pinnance, which he found with a frigate that &s;he had taken with twenty-eight fat hogs, 200 hens, and a great &s;tore of maize or Indian corn. The ve&s;&s;el it&s;elf was &s;o &s;trong and well-built, that he fitted it for war, determining to make a &s;econd attempt on Nombre de Dios.</P>
<P>On March the 21&s;t, he &s;et &s;ail with the new frigate and the Bear towards the Cabezes, at which he arrived in little more than two days, and found there one Totu, a Frenchman, with a &s;hip of war. Having &s;upplied Totu with water, and other articles of which he was in want, he de&s;ired to join the Admiral in his new attempt, to which Drake con&s;ented, and admitted him to accompany him with 20 of his men, &s;tipulating to allow them a proportionable &s;hare of what|ever booty they &s;hould acquire: yet Drake was not without &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of danger from this
<PB N="38" REF="105">
new ally, he having eighty men, and the Eng|li&s;h reduced to thirty-one. Manning, however, the pinnaces, they &s;et &s;ail for Rio Franci&s;co, at which place they arrived on the 29th of March. Here they landed; and, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their pinnaces for fear of di&s;covery, and ordered them to repair to the &s;ame place on the fourth day following, they began their march through the woods towards Nombre de Dios, and con|tinued it with &s;uch &s;ilence and regularity as &s;ur|prized the French, who did not imagine the Symerons &s;o di&s;creet and obedient to command as they appeared to be, and were therefore in perpetual anxiety about the fidelity of their guides: nor did the Symerons treat the French|men with that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and regard which they paid to the Engli&s;h, who&s;e bravery and conduct they had already tried. At length, after a la|borious march of more than &s;even leagues, they began to hear the hammers of the carpenters in the bay, it being the cu&s;tom in that hot &s;ea&s;on to work in the night, and to re&s;t in the day; and, in a &s;hort time, they perceived the ap|proach of the recoes, or droves of mules, from Panama. They now no longer doubted that their labour would be rewarded, and every man imagined him&s;elf &s;ecure from poverty for the remaining part of his life; they, therefore, when the mules came up, ru&s;hed out, and &s;eiz|ed them with an alacrity proportioned to their expectations. The three droves con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and nine mules, each of which carried
<PB N="39" REF="106">
300 pounds weight of &s;ilver. It was to little purpo&s;e that the &s;oldiers, ordered to convoy the trea&s;ure, attempted re&s;i&s;tance. After a &s;hort combat, in which the French Captain and one of the Symerons were wounded, it appeared with how much greater ardour men are anima|ted by intere&s;t than fidelity.</P>
<P>As it was po&s;&s;ible for them to carry away but a &s;mall part of this trea&s;ure, after having wearied them&s;elves with hiding it in the thickets, they determined to return by the &s;ame way they came; and, without being pur&s;ued, they tra|ver&s;ed the woods, where the French Captain, being di&s;abled by his wound, was obliged to &s;tay, two of his company continuing with him. When they had gone forward about two leagues, the Frenchmen mi&s;&s;ed another of their company, who, upon enquiry, was known to be intoxicated with wine, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t him&s;elf in the woods by neglecting to ob|&s;erve the guides; but common prudence not allowing them to hazard the whole company by too much &s;olicitude for a &s;ingle life, they tra|velled on towards Rio Franci&s;co, at which they arrived on the 3d of April; and, looking out for their pinnaces, were &s;urpri&s;ed with the &s;ight of &s;even Spani&s;h &s;loops, and immediately con|cluded, that &s;ome intelligence of their motions had been carried to Nombre de Dios, and that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els had been fitted out to pur&s;ue them, which might undoubtedly have over|powered the pinnaces and their feeble crews.
<PB N="40" REF="107">
Nor did their &s;u&s;picions &s;top here; but imme|diately it occurred to them, that their men might be compelled by torture to di&s;cover where their frigate and &s;hip were &s;tationed, which being weakly manned, and without the pre&s;ence of the chief Commander, would fall into their hands almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance, and all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of e&s;caping be entirely cut off. The&s;e re|flections &s;unk the whole company into de&s;pair; and every one, in&s;tead of endeavouring to break through the difficulties that &s;urrounded him, re&s;igned him&s;elf up to his ill fortune; when Drake, who&s;e intrepidity was never to be &s;haken, repre&s;ented to them, that, though the Spaniards &s;hould have made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the pinnaces, they might yet be hindered from di&s;|covering the &s;hips. He put them in mind, that the pinnaces could not be taken, the men exa|mined, their examinations compared, their re|&s;olutions formed, their ve&s;&s;els &s;ent out, and the &s;hips taken, in an in&s;tant. Some time mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;pent before the la&s;t blow could be &s;truck; and, if that time were not neglect|fully lo&s;t, it might be po&s;&s;ible for &s;ome of them to reach the &s;hips before the enemy, and direct them to change their &s;tation.</P>
<P>They were animated with this di&s;cour&s;e, by which they ob&s;erved that their leader was not without hope; but, when they came to look more narrowly into their &s;ituation, they were unable to conceive upon what it was founded. To pa&s;s by land was impo&s;&s;ible, as the way lay

over high mountains, thick woods, and deep rivers; they had not a &s;ingle boat in their power, &s;o that pa&s;&s;age by water &s;eemed equally impracticable. But Drake determined upon the only means of &s;ucce&s;s which their condition afforded them; and, ordering his men to make a raft out of the trees that were then floating in the river, offered him&s;elf to put out to &s;ea upon it, and chearfully a&s;ked, who would accompany him. John Owen, John Smith, and two Frenchmen, who were willing to &s;hare his fortune, embarked with him on the raft, which was fitted out with a &s;ail made of the bi&s;cuit &s;acks in which they had carried their provi&s;ions, and formed a kind of oar to direct its cour&s;e in&s;tead of a rudder. Then, having comforted the re&s;t with a&s;&s;urances of his regard for them, and re&s;olution to leave nothing unattempted for their deliverance, he put off; and, after having with much difficulty failed three leagues, de|&s;cried two pinnaces ha&s;ting towards him, which; upon a nearer approach, he di&s;covered to be his own; and, hailing them, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould anchor behind a point that jutted out into the &s;ea, while he put to &s;hore; and, cro&s;|&s;ing the land on foot, was received by his com|pany with that &s;atisfaction, which is only known to tho&s;e who have been acquainted with dan|gers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night they rowed &s;ilently to Rio Franci&s;co, where they embarked the whole company, with what trea&s;ure they had been
<PB N="42" REF="110">
able to bring with them through the woods; then &s;ailing back with the utmo&s;t expedition, they returned to their frigate, and &s;oon after to their &s;hip, where Drake divided the gold and &s;ilver equitably between the French and Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Here they &s;pent fourteen days in fitting out their frigate more completely; during which time, the Frenchmen, with their &s;hip, lay among the Cabezes, while twelve Engli&s;h and &s;ixteen Symerons travelled once more into the country, as well to recover the French Captain, whom they had left wounded, as to bring away the trea&s;ure which they had hid in the woods. Drake, whom his company would not &s;uffer to hazard his per&s;on in another land expedition, went with them to Rio Franci&s;co, where he found one of the Frenchmen who had &s;taid to attend their Captain, and was informed by him, upon his enquiries after his fortune, that, half an hour after their &s;eparation, the Spaniards came upon them, and ea&s;ily &s;eized upon the wounded Captain; but that his companion might have e&s;caped with him, had he not pre|ferred money to life; for &s;eeing him throw down a box of jewels that retarded him, he could not forbear taking it up, and, with that and the gold which he had already, was &s;o loaded that he could not e&s;cape. With regard to the bars of gold and &s;ilver which they had concealed in the ground, he informed them that 200 men had been employ|ed in &s;earching for them. The people, how|ever, either mi&s;tru&s;ting the informer's veracity, or
<PB N="43" REF="111">
confident that what they had hidden could not be found, pur&s;ued their journey; but upon their arrival at the place, found the ground turned up for two miles round, and were able to reco|ver no more than 13 bars of &s;ilver, and &s;mall quantity of gold. They di&s;covered afterwards, that the Frenchman who was left drunk in the woods, falling into the hands of the Spaniards, was tortured by them till he confe&s;&s;ed where Drake and his company had concealed their plunder; &s;o fatal to Drake's expedition was the drunkenne&s;s of his followers.</P>
<P>Then, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the French, they pa&s;&s;ed by Carthagena with their colours flying, and &s;oon after took a frigate laden with provi&s;ions and honey, which they valued as a great re&s;torative, and then &s;ailed away to the Cabezes. Here they &s;taid about a week to careen their ve&s;&s;els, and fit them for a long voyage, determining to &s;et &s;ail for England; and that the faithful Sy|merons might not go away unrewarded, broke up their pinnaces, and gave them the iron, the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent in the world to a na|tion who&s;e only employments were war and hunting, and among&s;t whom &s;how and luxury had no place. Pedro, their Captain, being de|&s;ired by Drake to go through the &s;hips, and to chu&s;e what he mo&s;t de&s;ired, fixed his eye upon a &s;cymetar &s;et with jewels, which the French Captain had pre&s;ented to Drake for the provi|&s;ions with which he had &s;upplied him, and, be|ing unwilling to a&s;k for &s;o valuable a pre&s;ent,
<PB N="44" REF="112">
offered for it four large quoits, or thick plates of gold, which he had formerly concealed in the waters; but Drake, de&s;irous to &s;hew him, that fidelity &s;eldom is without a recompence, gave it him with the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of &s;atisfaction and e&s;teem. Pedro, receiving it with the ut|mo&s;t gratitude, informed him, that by be&s;tow|ing it he had conferred greatne&s;s and honour upon him; for, by pre&s;enting it to his King, he doubted not of obtaining the highe&s;t rank among the Symerons. He then per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution of giving him the gold, which was o&s;|tentateou&s;ly thrown by Drake into the common &s;tock; pretending, that tho&s;e at who&s;e expences he had been &s;ent out, ought to &s;hare in all the gain of the expedition. Thus was Drake's cha|racter con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; he was equally vain and avaricious; and by this &s;pecious &s;hew of ho|ne&s;ty, his view was to engage his followers to do the like; yet whatever lengths he might go to &s;ave appearances, he had &s;carce cunning enough to di&s;gui&s;e the artifice.</P>
<P>They now for&s;ook the coa&s;t of America, which for many months they had kept in perpetual a|larms, having taken more than 100 ve&s;&s;els of all &s;izes between Carthagena and Nombre de Dios, of which, however, they never de&s;troyed any, unle&s;s they were fitted out again&s;t them, nor ever detained the pri&s;oners longer than was nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;ecurity or concealment; a behaviour which humanity dictates, and which even policy cannot di&s;approve. He mu&s;t, cer|tainly,
<PB N="45" REF="113">
meet with ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition who makes it equally dangerous to yield as to re&s;i&s;t, and who leaves his enemies no hopes but from victory.</P>
<P>What riches they acquired is not particularly related; but, it is not to be doubted, that the plunder of &s;o many ve&s;&s;els, together with the &s;ilver &s;eized at Nombre de Dios, mu&s;t have a|mounted to a very great &s;um, though the &s;hare that was allotted to Drake was not &s;ufficient to lull him into effeminacy, or to repre&s;s his na|tural inclination to adventures. They arrived at Plymouth on the 9th of Augu&s;t, 1573, on Sunday in the afternoon; and &s;o much were the people elated with the news of their arrival, that they left the preacher, and ran in crouds to the key with &s;houts and congratulations.</P>
<P>Drake having, in the voyage ju&s;t mentioned, had a view of the South Sea, as has already been related, and formed a re&s;olution to &s;ail upon it, did not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be diverted from his de&s;ign by the pro&s;pect of any difficulties that might ob&s;truct the attempt, nor any danger that might attend the execution. His reputa|tion was &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed to remove all ob&s;tacles (for ob&s;tacles he met with,) and to obviate the motives that produced them; but it was not till the year 1577, that he was able to a&s;&s;emble a force proportioned to his de&s;ign, and to obtain a commi&s;&s;ion from the Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This commi&s;&s;ion, which was always que&s;tioned, is now upon the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptive evidence denied, as will be &s;een in the &s;equel.</NOTE>, by

which he was con&s;tituted Captain-General of a &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five ve&s;&s;els, of which the Pelican, of 100 tons, was commanded by him|&s;elf as Admiral; the Elizabeth, of 80 tons, Vice-Admiral, commanded by John Winter; the Marygold, of 30 tons, by John Thomas; the Swan, of 50 tons, by John Che&s;ter; and the Chri&s;topher, of 15 tons, by Thomas Moon, the hone&s;t carpenter, who, on the former voyage, de&s;troyed the Swan by Drake's direction.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hips, equipped partly by him&s;elf, and partly by other private adventurers, he manned with 164 &s;tout &s;ailors, and furni&s;hed with &s;uch provi&s;ions, as he thought nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o long and hazardous a voyage: nor did he confine his concern to the ordinary equipment of his &s;hips with naval &s;tores and military preparations, but carried with him whatever he thought might contribute to rai&s;e, in tho&s;e nations with which he &s;hould have intercour&s;e, the highe&s;t ideas of the arts and grandeur of his native country. He, therefore, not only procured a complete &s;ervice of &s;ilver-plate for his own table, and furni&s;hed the cook-room with many ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame metal, but engaged &s;everal mu&s;icians to accompany him; rightly judging, that no|thing would more excite the admiration of &s;a|vages, or uncivilized people, than the powers of mu&s;ic. On this occa&s;ion, however, it mu&s;t not be concealed, that he engaged his men on the fal&s;e pretence of &s;ailing to Alexandria; and
<PB N="47" REF="115">
that it was not till after he arrived on the coa&s;t of Brazil, that he acquainted them with his de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing the Straits, and entering the South Seas.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Nov. 1577, about three in the afternoon, he &s;ailed from Plymouth; but a heavy &s;torm (&s;uch as no man on board had ever &s;een the like,) taking him almo&s;t as &s;oon as out of port, forced him into Falmouth, where he &s;taid till the 13th of December to refit. He then took his departure, and on the 25th of the &s;ame month fell in with the coa&s;t of Barbary, and on the 27th ca&s;t anchor at the i&s;land of Mo|gadore, about one mile di&s;tant from the main, between which and the i&s;le they found a very convenient harbour. Here he began to build the pinnaces, the frames of which he brought ready from Plymouth to be put together, as in his former voyage. While the carpenters were employed in this &s;ervice, they were di&s;covered by the Moors that inhabit tho&s;e coa&s;ts, who &s;ent two of their Chiefs on board Drake's &s;hip, re|ceiving at the &s;ame time two of his company as ho&s;tages. The&s;e men he not only treated in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner, but pre&s;ented them with &s;uch things as they appeared mo&s;t to ad|mire; it being with him an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, to endeavour to &s;ecure in every country a kind reception to &s;uch Engli&s;hmen as &s;hould come after him, by treating the inhabitants with a &s;hew of kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="116">But this friendly intercour&s;e was in appear|ance &s;oon broken; for, on the next day, ob|&s;erving the Moors making &s;ignals from the land, they &s;ent out their boat, as before, to fetch them to the &s;hip; and one John Frye leapt a&s;hore, intending to become an ho&s;tage, as on the former day, when immediately he was &s;eized by the Moors; and the crew, ob&s;erving great numbers &s;tart from behind a rock with weapons in their hands, thought it next to mad|ne&s;s to attempt his re&s;cue, and, therefore, pro|vided for their own &s;ecurity by returning to the &s;hip. Frye was mounted on hor&s;eback, and immediately carried up into the country to their King, who being then in continual expectation of an inva&s;ion from Portugal, &s;u&s;pected that the&s;e &s;hips were &s;ent only to reconnoitre the coa&s;t, and di&s;cover a proper harbour for a more formidable fleet; but, being informed who they were, and whither they were bound, not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the captive, but made large offers of friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; which Drake, how|ever, did not &s;tay to receive; but being di&s;|gu&s;ted at this breach of the laws of commerce, and apprehending further treachery, he quitted the coa&s;t on December 31, and on the 17th of January arrived at Cape Blanco, having in their pa&s;&s;age taken &s;everal Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and found one in the harbour with no men.</P>
<P>Here, while Drake was employing his men in catching fi&s;h, and training them for land as well as &s;ea &s;ervice, the natives came down to
<PB N="49" REF="117">
the &s;ea &s;ide with ambergrea&s;e and other gums, to traffic for &s;uch commodities as they then &s;tood mo&s;t in need of, and with which Drake very copiou&s;ly &s;upplied them.</P>
<P>Having rifled and di&s;charged the Spani&s;h &s;hips which they had taken, they &s;ailed on the 22d of January towards the i&s;les of Cape Verd, and on the 27th came to anchor before Mayo, hoping to furni&s;h them&s;elves with fre&s;h water; but, having landed, they found the chief town de&s;erted; and, marching farther up the country, &s;aw the vallies extremely fruitful, and abound|ing with ripe figs, cocoes, and plantains, but could by no means prevail upon the inhabitants to conver&s;e or traffic with them. However, they were &s;uffered by them to range the coun|try without mole&s;tation, but found no water, except at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, that the labour of carrying it to their &s;hips was greater than it was at that time nece&s;&s;ary for them to undergo. Salt, had they wanted it, might have been obtained with le&s;s trouble, being left by the &s;ea upon the &s;ands, and hardened by the &s;un during the ebb, in &s;uch quantities, that the chief traffic of this i&s;land is carried on by means of it. Thus, though the i&s;land abound|ed with goats, poultry, and delicious fruits of various kinds, they could procure none of any con&s;equence, becau&s;e the Portugue&s;e, who were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, were prohibited all com|merce with &s;trangers on very &s;evere penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="118">On the 31&s;t of January they made St. Iago, an i&s;land at that time divided between the na|tives and the Portugue&s;e, who, fir&s;t entering the&s;e i&s;lands under the &s;hew of traffic, by de|grees e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves, claimed a &s;upe|riority over the natives, and harra&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch cruelty, that they obliged them either to fly to the woods and mountains, where many of them peri&s;hed with hunger, or to take arms again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and, under the in&s;upe|rable di&s;advantages with which they contended, to die almo&s;t without a battle. Such treatment had the natives of St. Iago received, which had driven them into the rocky parts of the i&s;land, from whence they made incur&s;ions into the plantations of the Portugue&s;e, &s;ometimes with lo&s;s, but generally with that &s;ucce&s;s which de&s;|peration produces; &s;o that the Portugue&s;e were in continual alarms, and lived with the natural con&s;equences of guilt, terror, and anxiety. They were wealthy but not happy, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed the i&s;land, but did not enjoy it.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing this i&s;land, the garri&s;on of the fort di&s;charged three pieces of cannon at them, but without effect. For this in&s;ult they took a Por|tugue&s;e &s;hip laden with wines, the pilot of which they retained, but &s;et the re&s;t of the crew on &s;hore. This man, Nuno da Silva by name, was very u&s;eful to them in traver&s;ing the coa&s;t of Brazil, being acquainted with the bays and har|bours where fre&s;h water and provi&s;ions were to be obtained. Him they continued to detain
<PB N="51" REF="119">
captive, though they broke up his &s;hip before they entered the Straits, till they were about to leave the coa&s;ts of Peru, when finding him no longer &s;erviceable, they &s;et him on &s;hore in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, from whence he afterwards returned home, and wrote an account of the voyage as far as he went, which is thought by many to be very authentic.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon after the capture of this &s;hip that a difference aro&s;e between Drake and his friend, Mr. Thomas Doughty, which gradually increa&s;|ing, grew into inveteracy, and terminated at la&s;t in the death of the latter. Doughty was a gen|tleman and a &s;cholar, whom Drake had per&s;uad|ed to embark in this expedition to better his for|tune; and to whom, till the incident happened which we are about to relate, he had &s;hewn par|ticular marks of favour and friend&s;hip; but tri|vial beginnings are often productive of the mo&s;t important events.</P>
<P>The ground of the malevolence with which Drake pur&s;ued Doughty, under the colour of ju&s;tice, has hitherto lain concealed from the public eye; but we &s;hall now trace it, &s;tep by &s;tep, till the fatal period when the unhappy victim was brought to the block, and when Drake, by &s;uffering revenge to triumph over virtue, left an indelible blot upon his character, which no panegyric can wipe away.</P>
<P>Among the Harleian manu&s;cripts there is a written account of this voyage, in which the author has particularly had his eye on this tran&s;|action.
<PB N="52" REF="120">
As he was an eye-witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed, his relation will be&s;t appear in his own words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Captain Drake, &s;ays he, having boarded the &s;hip of Nuno da Sylva, and fea&s;ted his eyes with the view of the commo|dities, he committed the cu&s;tody and well-ordering of this prize unto Ma&s;ter Thomas Doughty, as his good and e&s;teemed friend, praying him in any ca&s;e to &s;ee good order kept, and who&s;o &s;hould be the breaker there|of, to give him to under&s;tand of any &s;uch without exception of any.<P>"It thus chanced that General Drake had a brother (not the wi&s;e&s;t man in Chri&s;tendom), whom he put into this &s;aid prize, as al&s;o di|vers others. This Thomas Drake, as one more greedy of prey than covetous of hone&s;ty or credit, offered him&s;elf the fir&s;t and only man to break the General his brother's com|mandment; for he, contrary to his &s;trict pro|hibition, did not only break open a che&s;t, but did dive &s;uddenly into the &s;ame, that Ma&s;ter Doughty knew not how to di&s;charge him&s;elf again&s;t the General but by revealing it unto him; yet fir&s;t Ma&s;ter Doughty called Tho|mas Drake unto him, and &s;hewed him his great folly in this behalf, who, yielding unto his fault, prayed Ma&s;ter Doughty to be good unto him, and keep it from the General; but he briefly told him he could not keep it, but he would deliver it with what favour he might. So at the General's next coming on
<PB N="53" REF="121">
board the prize, Ma&s;ter Doughty opened the &s;ame unto him, who pre&s;ently falling into a rage, not without &s;ome great oaths, &s;eemed to wonder what Thomas Doughty &s;hould mean to touch his brother; and did, as it were, a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf that he had &s;ome farther meaning in this, and that he meant to &s;trike at his credit, and he would not, or could not, by God's life (as he phra&s;ed it,) &s;uffer it. From this time forth grudges did &s;eem to grow between them from day to day, to the no &s;mall admiration of the re&s;t of the com|pany, although &s;ome envying his former fa|vour and friend&s;hip with the General, and &s;ome, I think, doubting that his capacity would reach too far to the aggrandizing his credit in the country, talked variou&s;ly of the matter; however, Ma&s;ter Doughty was put again into the Pelican. Thus grudges, al|though they had not long re&s;ted, yet were they grown to great extremities, &s;uch and &s;o great as a man of any judgment would verily think that his love towards him in England was more in brave words than hearty good will or friendly love."</P></Q> So writes our author.</P>
<P>In proceeding on their voyage, they came within &s;ight of Fogo, an i&s;land &s;o called from a mountain about the middle of it continually burning, and like the re&s;t inhabited by the Por|tugue&s;e. Two leagues to the &s;outh of Fogo lies Brava, which has received its name from its fertility, abounding with all kinds of fruits,
<PB N="54" REF="122">
and watered with great numbers of &s;prings and brooks, but, having neither harbour nor anchor|age, was at that time uninhabited.</P>
<P>Drake, having &s;ent out his boats with plum|mets to &s;ound, was not able to find any ground about it; and it is reported, that many experi|ments of the like kind have been made without &s;ucce&s;s. However, he took in water &s;ufficient; and on the 2d of Feb. &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of Brazil.</P>
<P>On February the 17th, he pa&s;&s;ed the equator, after being becalmed near three weeks, during which time they had dreadful &s;torms of thunder with lightning, but without any memorable ac|cident, till, continuing their voyage, on March 28, one of their ve&s;&s;els with 28 men, and the greate&s;t part of the fre&s;h water on board, was, to their great di&s;couragement, &s;eparated from them; but their perplexity la&s;ted not long, for on the next day they di&s;covered her, and &s;he again joined her a&s;&s;ociates. In their long cour&s;e, which gave them opportunities of ob&s;erving &s;everal animals, both in the air and water, at that time very little known, nothing enter|tained or &s;urprized them more than the flying-fi&s;h, which is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize with a herring, and has fins of the length of his whole body, by the help of which, when he is pur|&s;ued by the benito (a large kind of mackarel,) as &s;oon as he finds him&s;elf upon the point of being taken, he &s;prings up into the air, and flies forward as long as his wings continue wet, moi&s;|ture being, as it &s;eems, nece&s;&s;ary to make them
<PB N="55" REF="123">
pliant and moveable; and, when they become dry and &s;tiff, he falls down into the water, un|le&s;s &s;ome ve&s;&s;el intercepts him, and dips them again for a &s;econd flight. This unhappy ani|mal is not only pur&s;ued by fi&s;hes in his natural element, but attacked in the air, where he hopes for &s;ecurity, by the don or &s;par kite, a great bird that preys upon fi&s;h; and their &s;pecies mu&s;t certainly be de&s;troyed, were not their increa&s;e &s;o great, that the young fry, in one part of the year, covers that part of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>There is another fi&s;h, named the cuttle, of which whole &s;hoals will &s;ometimes ri&s;e at once out of the water, and of which a great multi|tude fell into their &s;hip.</P>
<P>At length, having &s;ailed without &s;ight of land for 54 days, they arrived April the 5th on the coa&s;t of Brazil. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the mean while, you &s;hall hear, &s;ays our author, what befel: Ma&s;ter Drake, never leaving to &s;eek and force upon Ma&s;ter Doughty, found, in the end, this op|portunity to degrade him. Whether of pur|po&s;e, or his own voluntary, it chanced John Brown the trumpet to go aboard the Pelican, where, for that he had been long ab&s;ent, the company offered him a hobbey, among the which, Ma&s;ter Doughty putting in his hand, &s;aid, Fellow John, you &s;hall have in my hand, although it be but light among&s;t the re&s;t; and &s;o laying his hand on his buttock, which perceived of John Trumpet, he began to &s;wear wounds and blood to the company to let him
<PB N="56" REF="124">
loo&s;e, for they are not all (&s;aid he) the Gene|ral's friends that be here; and with that turn|ed him to Ma&s;ter Doughty, and &s;aid unto him, (as him&s;elf pre&s;ently after told me in the prize) God's wounds, Doughty, what do&s;t thou mean to u&s;e this familiarity with me, con&s;idering thou art not the General's friend; who an&s;wered him, What, fellow John! what moves you to this, and to u&s;e the&s;e words to me, that am as good and as &s;ure a friend to my good General as any in this place, and I defy him that &s;hall &s;ay the con|trary. But is the matter thus? why yet, fel|low John, I pray thee let me live until I come into England. Thus, John Brown coming again pre&s;ently aboard the prize, had not talked any long time with the General, but the boat went aboard and re&s;ted not, but pre&s;ently brought Ma&s;ter Doughty to the prize's &s;ide, General Drake &s;itting in the mid&s;t of his men, who hearing the boat at the &s;hip's &s;ide &s;tood up, and Ma&s;ter Doughty offering to take hold of the &s;hip to have en|tered, &s;aid the General, Stay there, Thomas Doughty, for I mu&s;t &s;end you to another place, and with that commanded the mari|ners to row him on board the fly-boat, &s;aying unto him, it was a place more fit for him than that from whence he came: but Ma&s;ter Doughty, although he craved to &s;peak with the General, could not be permitted, neither would he hear him."</Q> Soon after this, the
<PB N="57" REF="125">
fly-boat here mentioned, (called the Swan,) was &s;eparated from them by a violent &s;torm, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in all who&s;e ab&s;ence, &s;ays our author, the General never cea&s;ed to inveigh again&s;t Ma&s;|ter Doughty, terming him a conjurer and a witch; and, at any time when we had foul weather, he would &s;ay that Tom. Doughty was the occa&s;ion thereof, and that it came out of Tom. Doughty's capca&s;e, and would avouch the &s;ame with oaths."</Q></P>
<P>After the &s;torm above-mentioned, they &s;teered near the land to the &s;outhward; and on the 14th anchored under a cape, which they afterwards called Cape Joy, becau&s;e in two days the ve&s;&s;el that was mi&s;&s;ing returned to them. Here they refre&s;hed their weary crews, and took in fre&s;h water; but, finding the country, though plea|&s;ant, without inhabitants, they weighed anchor, and, by running a little farther to the &s;outhward, found a &s;mall harbour between a rock and the main, where the rock breaking the force of the &s;ea, the &s;hips rode at anchor with the greate&s;t &s;ecurity. On this rock they killed &s;everal &s;eals, keeping them for food, and found them whole|&s;ome, though not palatable.</P>
<P>Their next cour&s;e was directed to the great river of Plate, in 36 deg. of &s;outh latitude; but, not finding anchorage in that river, they &s;ailed in que&s;t of a more convenient harbour, when they were &s;urprized by a &s;udden &s;torm, in which they again lo&s;t &s;ight of the fly-boat. This accident determined Drake to contract the number of his
<PB N="58" REF="126">
&s;hips, that he might not only avoid the incon|venience of &s;uch frequent &s;eparations, but ea&s;e the labour of his men, by having more hands in each ve&s;&s;el. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ailed along the coa&s;t; and on May the 13th di&s;covered a bay, which, though it promi&s;ed fair, he dur&s;t not enter before it was examined: he, therefore, ordered his boat to be hoi&s;ted out, and, taking the line into his own hand, went on &s;ounding the pa&s;&s;age till he was three leagues from his &s;hip, when on a &s;udden the weather changed, the &s;kies blackened, the wind ro&s;e, and all the u&s;ual forerunners of a &s;torm began to threaten them. Nothing was now thought of but the means of returning to the &s;hip; but the thick|ne&s;s of the fog intercepting it from their &s;ight, made the attempt almo&s;t impracticable. In this perplexity, which Drake was not more &s;en&s;ible of than tho&s;e whom he had left in the &s;hips, nothing was to be omitted, however dangerous, that might tend to extricate them from it. Cap|tain Thomas, therefore, having the lighte&s;t ve&s;&s;el, &s;teered boldly into the bay, and, taking the Admiral on board, dropt anchor, and lay out of danger; while the re&s;t that were in the open &s;ea &s;uffered much from the tempe&s;t, and the Mary, (the Portugue&s;e prize) was driven before the wind. The others, as &s;oon as the tempe&s;t was over, di&s;covering by the fires that were made on &s;hore where Drake was, repaired to him.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="127">Here they met with no inhabitants, though there were &s;everal wigwams or huts &s;tanding, in which they found &s;ome dried fowls, and among them o&s;triches, of which the thighs were as large as tho&s;e of a &s;heep. The&s;e birds are too unwieldy to ri&s;e from the ground; but with the help of their wings, or rather &s;tumps, they run &s;o &s;wiftly, that the Engli&s;h could never come near enough to &s;hoot any of them.</P>
<P>Not finding this harbour convenient, or well &s;tored with wood and water, they left it on the 15th of May, and on the 18th entered another much &s;afer and more commodious, which they no &s;ooner arrived at, than Drake &s;ent Winter to the &s;outhward in &s;earch of tho&s;e &s;hips that were ab&s;ent, and immediately after &s;ailed him&s;elf to the northward, and happily meeting with the Swan, conducted her to the re&s;t of the fleet; after which, in pur&s;uance of his former re&s;olu|tion, he ordered her to be broken up, pre&s;erv|ing the iron work for a future &s;upply. The other ve&s;&s;el which was &s;eparated in the late &s;torm, could not be di&s;covered. While they were thus employed upon an i&s;land about a mile from the main land, to which, at low wa|ter, there was a pa&s;&s;age on foot, they were di&s;|covered by the natives, who appeared upon a hill at a di&s;tance, dancing, and holding up their hands, as beckoning to the Engli&s;h to come to them, which Drake ob&s;erving, &s;ent out a boat with knives, bells, and bugles, and &s;uch things as by their u&s;efulne&s;s or novelty he imagined
<PB N="60" REF="128">
would be agreeable. As &s;oon as the Engli&s;h landed, they ob&s;erved two men running towards them as deputed by the company, who came within a little di&s;tance, and then &s;tanding &s;till, could not be prevailed upon to come nearer. The Engli&s;h, therefore, tied their pre&s;ents to a pole, which they fixed in the ground, and then retiring, &s;aw the Indians advance, who taking what they found upon the pole, left in return &s;uch feathers as they wore upon their heads, with a &s;mall bone about &s;ix inches in length, carved round the top, and burni&s;hed. Drake ob&s;erving their inclination to friend&s;hip and traffic, advanced with &s;ome of his company towards the hill, upon &s;ight of whom the Indians ranged them&s;elves in a line from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and one of them running from one end of the rank to the other, backwards and forwards, bowed him&s;elf towards the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, holding his hands over his head, and, frequently &s;topping in the middle of the rank, leaped up towards the moon, which then &s;hone directly over their heads; thus calling the &s;un and moon, the deities they wor&s;hip, to witne&s;s to the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions of peace and friend&s;hip. While this ceremony was per|forming, Drake and his company a&s;cended the hill, to the apparent terror of the Indians, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions when the Engli&s;h perceived, they peaceably retired, which gave the natives &s;o much encouragement, that they came forward immediately, and exchanged their arrows, fea|thers,
<PB N="61" REF="129">
and bones, for &s;uch trifles as were offered them. Thus they traded for &s;ome time; but by frequent intercour&s;e, finding that no violence was intended, they became familiar, and ming|led with the Engli&s;h without the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t. They go quite naked, except the &s;kin of &s;ome animals, which they throw over their &s;houlders when they walk or lie in the open air. They roll up their hair, which is very long, with a plume of o&s;trich's feathers, and u&s;ually &s;tick their arrows in it, that they may not encumber them, they being made with reeds headed with flint, and therefore not heavy. Their bows are about an ell long. Their chief ornament is paint, which they u&s;e of &s;everal kinds, delinea|ting generally upon their bodies the figures of the &s;un and moon in honour of their deities.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the inhabitants of mo&s;t nations among&s;t whom the u&s;e of cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aths is un|known, paint their bodies. Such was the practice of the inhabitants of our own country. To this cu&s;tom did our earlie&s;t enemies, the Picts, owe their denomination. As it is not probable that caprice or fancy &s;hould be uni|form, there mu&s;t be doubtle&s;s &s;ome rea&s;on for a practice &s;o general, and prevailing in di&s;tant parts of the world which have no communica|tion with each other. The original end of painting their bodies was probably to exclude the cold; an end, which, if we believe &s;ome rela|tions, is &s;o effectually produced by it, that the men thus painted never &s;hiver at the mo&s;t pierc|ing
<PB N="62" REF="130">
bla&s;ts: but, doubtle&s;s, any people &s;o harden|ed by continual &s;everities, would, even without paint, be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the cold than the civi|lized inhabitants of the &s;ame climate. How|ever, this practice may contribute in &s;ome de|gree to defend them from the injuries of win|ter, and, in tho&s;e climates where little evaporates by the pores, may be u&s;ed with no great incon|venience: but in hot countries, where per&s;pira|tion in a greater degree is nece&s;&s;ary, the natives only u&s;e unction to pre&s;erve them from the other extreme of weather, or, more probably, from the inconvenience of the flies, which, were it not for that or &s;ome &s;uch defence, would be intolerable.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;avages had no canoes, like the other Indians, nor any method of cro&s;&s;ing the water; which was probably the rea&s;on why the birds in the adjacent i&s;lands were &s;o tame that they might be taken with the hand, having never been before frighted or mole&s;ted. The birds here &s;poken of are, without doubt, the penguins, of which &s;o ample a de&s;cription is given in the Voyages of Byron and Wallis. The great plenty of the&s;e fowls, and of the &s;eals that were found every-where on the &s;hores of this coa&s;t, contri|buted much to the refre&s;hment of the Engli&s;h, who named the bay where they then lay, Seal-bay, from the number they there killed of tho&s;e animals.</P>

Nor were their other cu&s;toms le&s;s wild or uncouth than their way of feeding. One of them, having re|ceived a cap off the General's head, and being extremely plea&s;ed as well with the honour as the gift, to expre&s;s his gratitude, retired to a little di&s;tance, and thru&s;ting an arrow into his leg, let the blood run upon the ground, te&s;tify|ing, as it is probable, that he was ready to &s;hed his blood in his defence.</P>
<P>When the Swan fly-boat was &s;eparated from the fleet in the &s;torm off the coa&s;t of Brazil, the crew, de&s;pairing of ever being able to rejoin it, began to be in fear for provi&s;ions. They were on a de&s;art coa&s;t, had no place of rendezvous, and were ignorant even of their place of de&s;ti|nation. In this untoward &s;ituation a di&s;pute aro&s;e among the officers, of which the author of the manu&s;cript before cited, gives the following relation:&mdash;He had already taken notice, that Ma&s;ter Thomas Doughty had been &s;ent on board this ve&s;&s;el as a kind of puni&s;hment, and in truth &s;o it proved; for the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;|&s;el, who &s;eems al&s;o to have been the pur&s;er, knowing upon what terms he &s;tood with Drake, took every occa&s;ion to in&s;ult, or, as our author's phra&s;e is, to di&s;credit him; for tho&s;e were al|ways ranked among Drake's friends who were enemies to Ma&s;ter Doughty. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This man,
<PB N="64" REF="132">
fore&s;eeing that provi&s;ions might run &s;hort, put him&s;elf from the me&s;s of Ma&s;ter Doughty, Captain Che&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the gentle|men, and did &s;et him&s;elf among&s;t the &s;ailors, nothing at all &s;paring, but rather augmenting his own diet; but how &s;cantily tho&s;e gentle|men did fare, there be &s;ome come home, that, except they will deny their own words, can make relation thereof.<P>"Ma&s;ter Doughty, with Ma&s;ter Che&s;ter, whom the General had made Captain of the fly-boat, found them&s;elves &s;o ill u&s;ed, that Ma&s;ter Doughty acco&s;ted his friend one day in the&s;e words: I marvel, Ma&s;ter Che&s;ter, that you will take it at his hands to be thus u&s;ed, con|&s;idering that you were here authorized by the General to be our Commander. And, at the &s;ame time, he &s;poke to the Ma&s;ter, and told him, that he u&s;ed &s;o much partiality in the di&s;tribution of his provi&s;ions, that the &s;ame could not be borne, con&s;idering the extremity they were like to fall into for want of victuals; and that it was again&s;t rea&s;on that he and his me&s;&s;mates &s;hould be &s;o plentifully fed, while others were at the point to &s;tarve. The Ma&s;|ter hereat putting him&s;elf in a rage, &s;wore that &s;uch ra&s;cals as he was &s;hould be glad to eat the &s;hoals (hu&s;ks) when he would have them. Ma&s;ter Doughty an&s;wered him again, that rea&s;on would will that he &s;hould be u&s;ed as well as other men, con&s;idering his advantages. Thou any advantage here! replied the Ma&s;|ter,
<PB N="65" REF="133">
I would not give a point for thee nor thy advantages; and if ever thou come&s;t home to enjoy any advantages, I will be tru&s;&s;ed up. Then in multiplying words, and as I heard a blow or two pa&s;&s;ing between them, the Ma&s;|ter, in the &s;pleen of his heart, looking at him with an evil eye. Thou! will thou have vic|tuals! thou &s;halt be glad, if we do not meet with the General, the rather to eat that falls from my tail on the anchor-fluke ere thou gette&s;t home again. Then Ma&s;ter Doughty, turning to Ma&s;ter Che&s;ter, &s;aid unto him, Ma&s;ter Che&s;ter, let us not be thus u&s;ed at this knave's hands. Lo&s;e nothing of that au|thority that the General committed unto you. If you will, we will put the &s;word into your hands again, and you &s;hall have the govern|ment. This ca&s;e I will aver to be true, for there were two or three witne&s;&s;es &s;worn to the&s;e articles, as &s;ome of the &s;pecial matter that he had to lo&s;e his head for."</P></Q></P>
<P>It was not many days after this quarrel before the Swan fell in again with the fleet; when Drake, as has been &s;aid, cau&s;ed her to be hauled on &s;hore, &s;et on fire, and burnt; or, as others &s;ay, broke up and converted into fire-wood for the u&s;e of the fleet.</P>
<P>Mr. Doughty, being here delivered from the fly-boat, was again re&s;tored to the Pelican, where the ma&s;ter with whom he had the di&s;pute ap|pears to have preferred a complaint again&s;t him, and with &s;uch aggravations as he thought pro|per
<PB N="66" REF="134">
to add; all which were favourably heard, and credit given to the whole relation by the General, who wanted only a pretence to per|&s;evere in his &s;everity to the man who, being once his favourite, was now become the object of his aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Doughty, provoked, no doubt, by the mi&s;re|pre&s;entations of the ma&s;ter, and the partiality with which they were heard, gave the General &s;ome opprobrious language, adding, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the lighte&s;t word that came out of his (Doughty's) mouth was to be believed as &s;oon as the Ge|neral's oath. Whereupon the General did not only &s;trike him, but commanded him to be bound to the ma&s;t; for the accompli&s;hment of which, the ma&s;ter of the fly-boat took no little pains. This happened as the two &s;hips (the Pelican and the Canter) lay together; and as &s;oon as Doughty was relea&s;ed, he was put into the Canter, although greatly again&s;t his will, for that he &s;aid he knew them to be there that &s;ought his life, as namely the ma&s;ter of the fly-boat, and &s;ome other de&s;perate and unhone&s;t people; but would he or no, thi|ther he mu&s;t, or el&s;e the General &s;wore he would lift him out with the tackle, and for that purpo&s;e commanded the tackle to be loo&s;ed. Thus aboard the Canter he went, and his brother John Doughty with him."</Q> The Canter was a ve&s;&s;el taken from the Spaniards on the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="135">While they lay in this harbour, there is one remarkable incident related by this author that de&s;erves particular notice, as it tends to illu&s;trate the previous &s;teps that were pur&s;ued to accom|pli&s;h the ruin of this unfortunate gentleman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On board the fly boat, &s;ays he, was one Thomas Cuttle, who &s;ome time had been Captain of the Pelican under Drake, with whom the General had been tampering. This man came out from him in great wrath, and offering to go over to the main, between the which, and the i&s;land where they then lay, was (as has been &s;aid) but a &s;hallow water. He, &s;tanding well nigh up to the middle in the water with his piece, uttered the&s;e words, Well, my Ma&s;ters, quoth he, I find I am heavily borne with here, becau&s;e I will not accu&s;e this gentleman (meaning Doughty) of that, as I take God to witne&s;s, I know not by him; and, therefore, I declare before you all, that, what&s;oever becomes of me, I never knew any thing by him but to be the General's friend; and, rather than I will bide this hard countenance at the General's hands, I will yield my&s;elf into cannibal's hands; and &s;o I pray you all to pray for me."</Q></P>
<P>After this public declaration the man depart|ed; and, having reached the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, he went up into the country, where firing his piece to bring the natives to him, Drake taking it for a &s;ignal that he wanted to return, &s;ent a boat over to the main, and brought him back.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="136">Ju&s;t before their departure from this harbour, which lay in a bay a little to the &s;outhward of Cape Hope, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Captain Drake him&s;elf came on board the Elizabeth, and calling all the com|pany together, told them, that he was to &s;end thither a couple of men, the which he did not know how to carry along with him this voyage, and go thro' therewithal, as namely, quoth he, Thomas Doughty, who is a com|motioner and a &s;editious fellow, and a very bad and lewd fellow, and one that I have made that reckoning of as of my left hand; and his bro|ther the young Doughty, a witch, a poi&s;oner, and &s;uch a one as the world cannot judge of, having his knowledge from the devil; and &s;o warning the company that none &s;hould &s;peak to them, nor u&s;e any conference with them; if they did, he would hold them as his enemies, and enemies to the voyage. And he willed that great care &s;hould be taken that they &s;hould neither write nor read; and then he declared what wealth the wor&s;t boy in the fleet &s;hould get by this voyage, and how the wor&s;t boy &s;hould never need to go again to &s;ea, but &s;hould be able to live in England with a right good gentleman; for, quoth he, you &s;hall &s;ee that we will have gold come as plentiful as wood into the &s;hips. Having fini&s;hed his &s;peech, he departed, and &s;hortly after &s;ent the &s;aid Thomas Doughty and his brother aboard the Elizabeth, com|manding them, as they would an&s;wer it with
<PB N="69" REF="137">
their lives, not to &s;et pen to paper, nor yet to read but what every man might under&s;tand and &s;ee. And &s;ure, adds our author, their entertainment there was accordingly; for men dur&s;t not &s;peak to them, although wil|lingly perhaps they would; and as their fare was with the &s;imple&s;t in the &s;hip, &s;o was their lodging. But he, Thomas Doughty, having agreed with the boat&s;wain of the &s;hip for a cabin which &s;tood, God knows, in an uncom|fortable room, yet mu&s;t he pay 31. for the &s;ame in England. But what came of this to the poor fellow! he was fain for his friendly u&s;ing him to lo&s;e his office, and continue in heavy di&s;plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;taid fifteen days in the harbour, during which time they continued their friendly intercour&s;e with the &s;avages, on June the 3d they &s;et &s;ail towards the South Sea, and &s;ix days afterwards &s;topt at a little bay to break up the Chri&s;topher, which from the &s;mallne&s;s of its &s;ize was found incapable of living in tho&s;e boi&s;|terous &s;eas, of which, before they entered them, they had conceived no adequate idea. Then pa&s;&s;ing on, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to ca&s;t anchor in another bay, with a view to recover the Por|tugue&s;e prize, which was &s;eparated from them in the &s;torm of the 27th of April, and had not yet rejoined them. To return in &s;earch of it was &s;ufficiently mortifying; to proceed without it, was not only to deprive them&s;elves of a con&s;i|derable part of their force, but to expo&s;e their
<PB N="70" REF="138">
friends and companions, who had voluntarily embarked on board her, to certain death or certain captivity. This con&s;ideration prevail|ed; and, therefore, on the 18th, after prayers to God, with which Drake (for example's &s;ake) never forgot to begin an enterprize, he put to &s;ea, and the next day near Port Julian di&s;covered their a&s;&s;ociates, who&s;e &s;hip was now grown leaky, having &s;uffered much in the fir&s;t &s;torm by which they were &s;eparated, and afterwards in the fruit|le&s;s attempts to regain the fleet. Drake, there|fore, being de&s;irous to relieve their fatigues, en|tered Port Julian. They no &s;ooner landed than they were acco&s;ted by two of the natives, of whom Magellan left a very terrible account, having de&s;cribed them as a nation of giants and mon&s;ters: nor did they find his narrative entirely without foundation; for the lea&s;t of tho&s;e they &s;aw was larger and taller than the large&s;t of their company. The two who acco&s;ted the Engli&s;h appeared much plea&s;ed with their new gue&s;ts, received willingly whatever was given them, and very exactly ob&s;erved every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, &s;eeming more particularly delighted with &s;eeing Oliver, the ma&s;ter-gunner, &s;hoot an Engli&s;h arrow. They &s;hot them&s;elves likewi&s;e in emulation, but their arrows always fell to the ground far &s;hort of his.</P>
<P>Soon after this friendly conte&s;t came another, who, ob&s;erving the familiarity of his country|men with the &s;trangers, appeared much di&s;|plea&s;ed; and, as the Engli&s;hmen perceived, en|deavoured
<PB N="71" REF="139">
to per&s;uade them from &s;uch an in|tercour&s;e. What effect his arguments had was &s;oon after apparent; for another of Drake's companions, being de&s;irous to &s;hew the third Indian a &s;pecimen of the Engli&s;h valour and dexterity, attempted likewi&s;e to &s;hoot an arrow; but, drawing it with his full force, bur&s;t the bow-&s;tring: upon which, the Indians, who were unacquainted with their other weapons, imagin|ing them di&s;armed, followed the company as they were walking negligently down towards their boat, and let fly their arrows, aiming particularly at Winter, who had the bow in his hand. He, finding him&s;elf wounded in the &s;houlder, endea|voured to refit his bow; and, turning about, was pierced with a &s;econd arrow in the brea&s;t. Oliver, the gunner, immediately pre&s;ented his piece at the in&s;idious a&s;&s;ailants, which failing to take fire, gave them time to level another flight of arrows, by which he was killed; nor, per|haps, had any of them e&s;caped, &s;urprized and unprepared as they were, had not Drake anima|ted their courage, and directed their motions, or|dering them, by perpetually changing their places, to elude as much as might be the aim of their enemies, and to defend their bodies with their targets; and in&s;tructing them by his own example to pick up and break the arrows as they fell, which they did with &s;o much diligence that the Indians were &s;oon in danger of being di&s;armed. Then Drake him&s;elf taking the gun, which Oliver had &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted
<PB N="72" REF="140">
to make u&s;e of, di&s;charged it at the Indian that fir&s;t began the fray and had killed the gunner, aiming it &s;o happily that the hail-&s;hot, with which it was loaded, tore open his belly, and forced him to &s;uch terrible outcries, that the Indians, though their numbers increa&s;ed, and many of them &s;hewed them&s;elves from different parts of an adjoining wood, were too much ter|rified to renew the a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uffered Drake without mole&s;tation to withdraw his wounded friend, who, being hurt in his lungs, langui&s;hed two days, and then dying, was interred with his companion with the u&s;ual ceremony of a mili|tary funeral.</P>
<P>They &s;taid here two months after this quar|rel, without receiving any other injury from the natives, in which time they di&s;covered the gibbet on which Magellan had formerly execu|ted &s;ome of his mutinous company, and where <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Drake, according to the writers of the Bio|graphia Britannica, did the lea&s;t commendable action of his life, in executing Mr. John Doughty, a man next in authority to him|&s;elf; in which, however, he pre&s;erved a great appearance of ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P>To clear this matter fully, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to bring together the &s;ub&s;tance of what the&s;e authors have &s;aid on the &s;ubject, and then to add the plain relation from the manu&s;cript al|ready quoted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Here it was (at Port St. Julian,) &s;ay the&s;e writers, that on a &s;udden, having carried the
<PB N="73" REF="141">
principal per&s;ons engaged in the &s;ervice to a de&s;art i&s;land lying in the bay, he called a kind of council of war, or rather court-martial, where he expo&s;ed his commi&s;&s;ion, by which the Queen granted him the power of life and death, which was delivered him with this remarkable ex|pre&s;&s;ion from her own mouth; <HI>We do account that he, Drake, who &s;trikes at thee, does &s;trike at us.</HI> He then laid open, with great eloquence, (for, though his education was but indifferent, he had a wonderful power of &s;peech) the cau&s;e of this a&s;&s;embly. He proceeded next to charge Mr. John Doughty, <HI>who had been &s;econd in com|mand during the whole voyage,</HI> when Drake was pre&s;ent, and fir&s;t in his ab&s;ence, with plotting the de&s;truction of the undertaking, and the murder of his per&s;on. He &s;aid he had the fir&s;t notice of this gentleman's bad intentions before he left England; but that he was in hopes his behaviour towards him would have extin|gui&s;hed &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition, if there had been any truth in the information. He then appealed for his behaviour to the whole a&s;&s;embly, and to the gentleman accu&s;ed. He next expo&s;ed his practices from the time that he left England, while he lived towards him with all the kind|ne&s;s and cordiality of a brother; which charge he &s;upported by producing papers under his own hand, to which Mr. Doughty added a full and free confe&s;&s;ion. After this, the Captain, or, as in the language of tho&s;e times he is call|ed, the General, quitted the place, telling the
<PB N="74" REF="142">
a&s;&s;embly he expected that they &s;hould pa&s;s a verdict upon him, for he would be no judge in his own cau&s;e. Camden, as the reader will &s;ee, &s;ays, that he tried him by a jury; but, other accounts affirm, that the whole forty per&s;ons of which the court was compo&s;ed, had judged him to death, and gave this in writing under their hands and &s;eals, leaving the time and manner of it to the General. Mr. Doughty him&s;elf &s;aid, that he de&s;ired rather to die by the hands or ju&s;tice than to be his own execu|tioner. Upon this, Captain Drake, having maturely weighed the whole matter, pre&s;ented three points to Mr. Doughty's choice: fir&s;t, to be executed upon the i&s;land where they were; next, to be &s;et on &s;hore on the main land; or, la&s;tly, to be &s;ent home to abide the ju&s;tice of his country. He de&s;ired he might have till the next day to con&s;ider of the&s;e, which was allowed him, and then, giving his rea&s;ons for rejecting the two la&s;t, he declared that he made the fir&s;t his choice; and, having received the &s;acrament with the General, from the hands of Mr. Francis Fletcher, Chaplain to the fleet, and made a full confe&s;&s;ion, his head was cut off with an axe by the Provo&s;t-Mar|&s;hal, July the 2d, 1578.<P>'As to the imputation which this matter brought upon Drake, we will fir&s;t cite what Camden &s;ays of this tran&s;action: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On the 26th of April, entering into the mouth of the river of Plate, he &s;aw an infinite number of
<PB N="75" REF="143">
&s;ea-calves; from thence &s;ailing into the haven of St. Julian he found a gibbet, &s;et up, as it was thought, by Magellan for the puni&s;hment of certain mutineers. In this very place John Doughty, an indu&s;trious and &s;tout man, and the next unto Drake, was called to his trial for rai&s;ing a mutiny in the fleet, found guilty by twelve men after the Engli&s;h manner, and condemned to death, which he &s;uffered un|dauntedly, being beheaded, having fir&s;t re|ceived the holy communion with Drake. And, indeed, the mo&s;t impartial per&s;ons in the fleet were of opinion, that he had acted &s;edi|tiou&s;ly, and that Drake cut him off as an emulator of his glory, and one that regarded not &s;o much who he him&s;elf excelled in com|mendation for &s;ea matters, as who he thought might equal him; yet wanted there not &s;ome who, pretending to under&s;tand things better than others, gave out that Drake had in charge from Leice&s;ter to take off Doughty upon any pretence whatever, becau&s;e he had reported that the Earl of E&s;&s;ex was made away by the cunning practices of that Earl."</Q></P><P>'We find this matter, add the writers ju&s;t cited, touched in &s;everal other books, and particularly in two, which were written on purpo&s;e to expo&s;e the Earl of Leice&s;ter, and, perhaps, de&s;erving the le&s;s credit for that rea&s;on.</P>
<P>'It may be offered in defence of Sir Francis Drake, that this man was openly put to death, after as fair a trial as the circum&s;tances of time
<PB N="76" REF="144">
and place would permit; that he &s;ubmitted patiently to his &s;entence, and received the &s;a|crament with Drake, whom he embraced im|mediately before his execution. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are two points that de&s;erve particular con&s;ideration: fir&s;t, that, in &s;uch expeditions, &s;trict di&s;cipline, and legal &s;everity, are often ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; &s;econdly, that, as to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, for who&s;e death Doughty had expre&s;&s;ed concern, he was Drake's fir&s;t patron, and it is, therefore, very improbable he &s;hould de&s;troy a man for endeavouring to detect his murderer. We may add to all this, if liberty may be indulged to conjectures, that this man, pre&s;uming upon the Earl of Lei|ce&s;ter's favour (who very probably impo&s;ed him upon Drake to be rid of him,) was from thence encouraged to form de&s;igns again&s;t Drake; and this might al&s;o be the rea&s;on which hindered him from inclining to an ab|&s;olute pardon, as doubting whether it was po&s;&s;ible to tru&s;t one who had &s;o far abu&s;ed his confidence already, and who&s;e known intere&s;t with &s;o great a man might always enable him to find in&s;truments, in ca&s;e he was wicked enough to enter upon fre&s;h intrigues.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall ju&s;t remark upon what is above quoted, that the authors do not &s;eem to have been well informed; for they have all along imputed to John Doughty what related to his brother Thomas; and, if credit may be given to the author of the manu&s;cript (John Cook by

My Ma&s;|ters, you that be my good friends, Thomas Good, Gregory&mdash;, you there, my friends, bind him; &s;o they took and bound his arms be|hind him. Then he uttered divers furious words unto Thomas Doughty, as charging him to be the man that poi&s;oned my Lord of
<PB N="79" REF="147">
E&s;&s;ex; whereas Ma&s;ter Doughty avouched it to his face, that he was the man that brought the General fir&s;t to the pre&s;ence of my Lord in England. Thou bring ME, quoth the Ge|neral, to my Lord! See, my Ma&s;ters, &s;ee here how he goeth about to di&s;credit me. This fellow with my Lord was never of any e&s;timation. I think he never came about him as a gentleman; for I that was daily with my Lord never &s;aw him there above once, and that was long after my entertainment with my Lord.</P>
<P>"Then, in fine, was there a jury called, whereof Ma&s;ter John Winter was foreman. Then by John Thomas were the articles read unto them, <HI>even once over for a la&s;t farewel,</HI> for fear that men &s;hould have carried them away by memory; all which appeared to con&s;i&s;t of words of unkindne&s;s, and to pro|ceed of &s;ome choler when the pri&s;oner was provoked, all which Doughty did not greatly deny; until at length came in one Edward Bright, who&s;e hone&s;ty of life I have nothing to do with, who &s;aid, Nay, Thomas Doughty, we have other matter for you yet, that will a little nearer touch you. It will i'faith bite you to the gir&s;kin. I pray thee, Ned Bright, &s;aid the pri&s;oner, charge me with nothing but truth, and &s;pare me not. Then John Thomas read further for his la&s;t article to conclude the whole withal, That Thomas Doughty &s;hould &s;ay to Edward Bright, in Ma&s;ter
<PB N="80" REF="148">
Drake's garden, that the Queen's Maje&s;ty and Council would be corrupted. So Bright holding up his finger, &s;aid, How like ye this gare, &s;irrah? Why, Ned Bright, &s;aid Ma&s;|ter Doughty, what &s;hould induce thee thus to belye me? thou knowe&s;t that &s;uch familiarity was never between thee and me: but it may be, that I have &s;aid, if we brought home gold, we &s;hould be the better welcome; but yet this is more than I do remember. Then it came out, on farther evidence, that Ma&s;ter Doughty &s;hould &s;ay, that my Lord Trea&s;urer had a plot of the pre&s;ent voyage. No, that he hath not, quoth General Drake. The other replied, that he had, and had it of him. See, my Ma&s;ters, &s;aid Drake, what this fellow hath done, God will have his treachery all known; for her Maje&s;ty gave me &s;pecial commandment, that of all men my Lord Trea&s;urer &s;hould not know it; but you &s;ee his own mouth hath betrayed him: &s;o this was a &s;pecial article again&s;t him to hurt his throat, and greatly he &s;eemed to rejoice at this advantage.</P>
<P>"Then Ma&s;ter Doughty offered him, if he would permit him to live, and to an&s;wer the&s;e objections in England, he would &s;et his hand to what&s;o was there written, or to any thing el&s;e that he would &s;et down. Well, once let the&s;e men, quoth the General, fir&s;t find whether you are guilty in this or no, and then we will talk further of the matter.
<PB N="81" REF="149">
And then he delivered (after they had all taken their oaths given by John Thomas) the bills of indictment, as I may term them, unto Mr. John Winter, who was foreman of this inque&s;t. Then Ma&s;ter Leonard Vicary, a very a&s;&s;ured friend of Ma&s;ter Thomas Doughty's, &s;aid unto him, General, this is not law, nor agreeable to ju&s;tice, that you offer. I have not to do with you crafty lawyers, neither do I care for the law; but I know what I will do. Why, quoth Ma&s;ter Vicary, who was one of his jury, I know not how we may an&s;wer his life. Well, Ma&s;ter Vicary, quoth he, you &s;hall not have to do with his life; let me alone with that; you are but to find whether he be guilty in the&s;e articles that here are objected again&s;t him, or no. Why, very well, &s;aid Ma&s;ter Vicary, then there is, I tru&s;t, no matter of death. No, no, Ma&s;ter Vicary, quoth he; &s;o with this the jury went together, finding all to be true, without any doubt or &s;top made, but only to that article that Edward Bright had objected again&s;t him; for it was doubted of &s;ome whether Bright were &s;ufficient with his only word to ca&s;t away the life of a man. And truly it did argue &s;mall hone&s;ty in a man to conceal &s;uch a matter if it had been &s;poken in Eng|land, and to utter it in this place where will was law, and rea&s;on put in exile; for, an ho|ne&s;t &s;ubject would not have concealed &s;uch matter, which made &s;ome doubt of an hone&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="150">
dealing. But, to be brief, an&s;wer was made, that Bright was a very hone&s;t man; and &s;o the verdict being given in, it was told to the General, that there was doubt made of Bright's hone&s;ty. Why, quoth Ma&s;ter Drake, I dare to &s;wear that what Ned Bright has &s;aid is very true (yet within a fortnight after, the &s;ame Bright was in &s;uch di&s;liking with him, as he &s;eemed to doubt his life; and having di&s;placed him of the Pelican, and put him into the Marygold, he gave for rea&s;on, that him&s;elf would be &s;afe, and he would put him far enough from him.) Thus hav|ing received in the verdict, he ro&s;e off the place, and departed towards the water-&s;ide, where, calling all the company with him, ex|cept Ma&s;ter Thomas Doughty and his bro|ther, he there opened a certain bundle of letters and bills, and, looking on them, &s;aid, God's will! I have left in my cabin that I &s;hould e&s;pecially have had (as if he had there forgotten his Commi&s;&s;ion:) but, whether he forgot his Commi&s;&s;ion or no, he much forgot him&s;elf, to &s;it as Judge without &s;hewing that he had any; but, truly, I think he &s;hewed to the uttermo&s;t what he had: for here he &s;hewed forth, fir&s;t, letters that were written, as he &s;aid, by Ma&s;ter Hankins to my Lord of E&s;&s;ex for his entertainment; &s;econdly, he &s;hewed letters of thanks from my Lord of E&s;&s;ex unto Ma&s;ter Hankins, for preferring &s;o good a &s;ervitor unto him, and how much
<PB N="83" REF="151">
he had plea&s;ured him; then read the let|ters that pa&s;t from my Lord of E&s;&s;ex unto Secretary Wal&s;ingham in his great commen|dation; then &s;hewed he letters of Ma&s;ter Hatton's unto him&s;elf, tending for the accep|tance of his men John Thomas and John Brewer, for their well u&s;age in this voyage; and, la&s;tly, he read a bill of her Maje&s;ty's adventure of a thou&s;and crowns (but I mo&s;t marvelled that &s;o many noblemen and gentle|men did leave their letters in his hands, ex|cept it were to &s;hew in this place for his cre|dit.) So when he had all done, he &s;aid, Now, my Ma&s;ters, you may &s;ee whether this fellow hath &s;ought my di&s;credit or no, and what &s;hould hereby be meant but the very over|throw of the voyage; as, fir&s;t, by taking away of my good name, and altogether di&s;crediting me, and then my life, which I being bereav|ed of, what then will you do? You will fain one to drink another's blood, and &s;o to return again unto your own country; you will never be able to find the way thither. And now, my Ma&s;ters, con&s;ider what a great voyage we are like to make, the like was never made out of England; for by the &s;ame the wor&s;t in this fleet &s;hall become a gentleman; and, if this voyage go not forward, which I cannot &s;ee how po&s;&s;ibly it &s;hould, if this man live, what a reproach it will be, not only unto our country, but e&s;pecially unto us, the very &s;imple&s;t here may con&s;ider of. Therefore,
<PB N="84" REF="152">
my Ma&s;ters, they that think this man worthy to die, let them with me hold up their hands; and, they that think him not worthy to die, hold down their hands; at the which, divers that envied his former felicity, held up their hands; &s;ome others, again, for fear of his fa|vouritry, &s;ticked not to lift their hands, al|though again&s;t their hearts; but &s;ome, again, lifted up their hands and very hearts unto the Lord, to deliver us of this tyrannous and cruel tyrant; who upon the &s;ame, coming to his for|mer judgment-&s;eat, pronouned him the child of death, and per&s;uaded him withal, that he would by this means make him the &s;ervant of God: and &s;aid farther, if any man could, be|tween this and next meeting, devi&s;e any way that might &s;ave his life, he would hear it; and wi&s;hed him&s;elf to devi&s;e &s;ome way for his own &s;afeguard. Well, General, quoth he, &s;eeing it is come to this pa&s;s, <HI>that I &s;ee you would have me made away,</HI> I pray you carry me with you to Peru, and there &s;et me a&s;hore. No, truly, Ma&s;ter Doughty, I cannot an&s;wer it to her Maje&s;ty, if I &s;hould &s;o do; but, how &s;ay you, Thomas Doughty, if any man will war|rant me to be &s;afe from your hands, and will undertake to keep you &s;ure, you &s;hall &s;ee what I will &s;ay unto you. Ma&s;ter Doughty then calling on Ma&s;ter Winter, &s;aid unto him, Ma&s;ter Winter, will you be &s;o good as to un|dertake this for me? Then Ma&s;ter Winter &s;aid unto Ma&s;ter Drake, that he &s;hould be &s;afe of
<PB N="85" REF="153">
his per&s;on, and he would warrant him, if he did commit him to his cu&s;tody. Then Drake, a little pau&s;ing, &s;aid, See then, my Ma&s;ters, we mu&s;t thus do; we mu&s;t nail him clo&s;e un|der the hatches, and return home again with|out making any voyage, and if you will do &s;o, then &s;peak your minds. Then a company of de&s;perate bankrupts that could not live in their own country without the &s;poil of that as others had got by the &s;weat of their brows, cried, God forbid, good General! which voice was no le&s;s attentively heard, for there needed no &s;pur to a willing hor&s;e. Thus, telling Ma&s;ter Doughty to prepare for his death, and having given him one whole day's re&s;pite to &s;et all things in order, he ro&s;e and departed, promi&s;ing that his continual prayers to God &s;hould not cea&s;e, that it would plea&s;e God to put it into his head how he might do him good: but he had &s;o often before &s;worn that he would hang him, that I think at this pre&s;ent he meant to do him little good. Thus Ma&s;|ter Doughty continuing all this night, the next day, and the &s;econd night in his prayers, except &s;ome &s;mall time that he u&s;ed in &s;etting his wordly bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;ome way, and di&s;tri|buting to &s;uch as he thought good, &s;uch things as he then had with him, was the 2d day of July commanded to prepare him&s;elf, and to make ready to die. Then ma&s;ter Doughty, with a more chearful countenance then ever he had in all his life, to the &s;how, as one that
<PB N="86" REF="154">
did altogether contemn life, prayed him, that, ere he died, he might receive the &s;acrament; which was not only granted, but Drake him|&s;elf offered to accompany him to the Lord's Table, for the which Ma&s;ter Doughty gave him hearty thanks, never wor&s;e terming him than my good Captain. Ma&s;ter Drake offer|ed him withal to make choice of his own death, and for that he &s;aid he was a gentle|man be &s;hould but lo&s;e his head, the which kind of death was mo&s;t agreeable to his mind, in as much as he mu&s;t needs die. And, truly, I heard &s;ay, that Ma&s;ter Drake offered him, if he would, that he &s;hould be &s;hotten to death with a piece, and that he him&s;elf would do that exploit, and &s;o he &s;hould die by the hands of a gentleman. But, in fine, they to|gether received the Lord's Supper; the which, I do ever a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that he did take with as uncorrupted a mind as ever did any inno|cent of the world; for he, &s;ure, &s;hewed him|&s;elf to have all his affiance and only tru&s;t in God; he &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;o valiant in this extremity as the world might wonder at it; he &s;eemed to have conquered death it&s;elf, and it was not &s;een, that on all this day before his death, that ever he altered one jot of his countenance, but kept it as &s;taid and firm as if he had &s;ome me&s;&s;age to deliver to &s;ome nobleman. They having thus received the &s;acrament, there was a banquet made, &s;uch as the place might yield, and there they dined
<PB N="87" REF="155">
together, in which time, the place of execu|tion being made ready, after dinner, as one not willing any longer to delay the time, he told the General, that he was ready as &s;oon as plea&s;ed him; but prayed him, that he might &s;peak alone with him a few words, with the which they talked a-part the &s;pace of half a quarter of an hour, and then with bills and &s;taves he was brought to the place of execution, where he &s;hewed him&s;elf no le&s;s valiant than all the time before; for, fir&s;t, here kneeling on his knees, he fir&s;t prayed for the Queen's Maje&s;ty of England his So|vereign lady and mi&s;tre&s;s; he then prayed to God for the happy &s;uccce&s;s of this voyage, and prayed to God to turn it to the profit of his country: he remembered al&s;o therein di|vers his good friends, and e&s;pecially Sir William Winter, praying Ma&s;ter John Win|ter to commend him to that good Knight; all which he did with &s;o chearful a counte|nance, as if he had gone to &s;ome great prepared banquet, the which, I &s;ure think, that he was fully re&s;olved that God had provided for him; &s;o, at the la&s;t, turning to the General, he prayed him that he might make water ere he died, for, quoth he, the fle&s;h is frail, and withal turned him about and did &s;o; and, coming again, &s;aid, Now, truly, I may &s;ay as &s;aid Sir Thomas More, that he that cuts off my head &s;hall have little hone&s;ty, my neck is &s;o &s;hort: So turning him, and looking about
<PB N="88" REF="156">
on the whole company, he de&s;ired them all to forgive him, and e&s;pecially &s;ome that he did perceive to have di&s;plea&s;ure borne them for his &s;ake, whereof Thomas Cuttle was one, Hugh Smith was another, and divers others: whereupon, Smith prayed him to &s;ay before the General then, whether ever they had any conference together that might re|dound to his (the General's) prejudice or de|triment. He declared it at his death, that neither he, nor any man el&s;e, ever practi&s;ed any treachery towards the General with him; neither did he him&s;elf ever think any villain|ous thought again&s;t him. Then he prayed the General to be good unto the &s;ame Hugh Smith, and to forgive him for his &s;ake. So the General &s;aid, Well, Smith, for Ma&s;ter Doughty's &s;ake, and at his reque&s;t, I forgive thee; but become an hone&s;t man hereafter. So then, Ma&s;ter Doughty embracing the Ge|neral, naming him his good Captain, bid him farewel; and &s;o bidding the whole company farewel, he laid his head to the block, the which being &s;tricken off, Drake mo&s;t de|&s;pitefully made the head to be taken up and &s;hewed to the whole company, him&s;elf &s;aying, See, this is the end of traitors! So he being buried, and tho&s;e things fini&s;hed, the whole company being together, Ma&s;ter Drake prote&s;ted before God, that who&s;oever he was who &s;hould offend but the eighth part that Thomas Doughty had done, &s;hould die

<FIGURE>

for it. He al&s;o prote&s;ted, and &s;wore by the life of God, and the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament which he that day had received, that who&s;oever he were within the fleet that did give another a blow, &s;hould lo&s;e his hand, without exception of any; and yet, the next day, it fortuned that Ma&s;ter Doughty's younger brother, walking both &s;ilently and mournfully, as well for remembrance of his brother's late death, as al&s;o weighing the imminent peril over his own head, (as what has been already &s;aid and the pre&s;ent con&s;equence may pur|port), there comes unto him this Edward Bright, the chief in&s;trument of his Brother's death, &s;aying unto him, God's wounds! thou villain, what knowe&s;t thou by my wife? and withal &s;truck at him with his ruler, as of pur|po&s;e to pick a quarrel, to ha&s;ten his end al&s;o. Why, Ned Bright, quoth he, thou &s;ee&s;t in what ca&s;e I am, I pray thee let me alone; and withal bore off the blow with his arm, wherewith the ruler broke: but Bright, &s;eem|ing very furious, thru&s;t him in the face with the piece that remained in his hand, the &s;plin|ters whereof entered an inch into his face; pre&s;ently upon the which, he went unto the General to complain of Bright. Why, John Doughty, quoth he, without having any re|gard of his oath the day before made, Ned Bright will be open to your revenge in Eng|land; for, I dare &s;ay, thy brother did belye her, when he &s;aid that &s;he had an ill name in

Cambridge. Then might every man per|ceive the little-meant hone&s;ty."</P></Q></P>
<P>From this plain narrative of the trial and exe|cution of Doughty, of the genuinene&s;s of which there cannot be the lea&s;t doubt, as the conco|mitant little circum&s;tances all concur to confirm the author both an eye and ear witne&s;s of what he has related, there is rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage covered the iniquity of the undertaker; and that the immen&s;e booty which Drake brought to England, enabled him to &s;tifle the complaints of individuals; and, by a proper addre&s;s, to convert the acts of oppre&s;|&s;ion, murder and pyracy, of which he was guilty, into &s;o many deeds of nece&s;&s;ary duty, in order to the accompli&s;hment of the main object, the acqui&s;ition of wealth at the expence of ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>That Drake never had a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Queen, as his friends would &s;ugge&s;t, appears not only from his not producing it at the trial of Doughty (which can hardly be ju&s;tified, in con|tempt to the pri&s;oner), but from his not pro|ducing it upon another occa&s;ion, when, as &s;hall be &s;hewn immediately, he vauntingly produced other credentials of far le&s;s moment, in order to ju&s;tify his conduct, and give him credit with his company. The &s;tory, then, of the remarkable words foi&s;ted into the mouth of his Sovereign, and recited by his biographer, is as fal&s;e as in|con&s;i&s;tent with the character of that wi&s;e Prin|ce&s;s, who, though there is rea&s;on from her after-conduct
<PB N="91" REF="160">
to conclude that &s;he was privy to the voyage, yet never openly countenanced it, till after it was compleated, and the i&s;&s;ue of it de|termined; as appears from the account of the conver&s;ation which Drake him&s;elf gave to his followers, a few days before he left Port St. Ju|lian to &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age into the South Seas.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On the 6th of Augu&s;t, &s;ays our Author, he commanded his whole company to be a&s;hore, and, placing him&s;elf in a tent, one &s;ide of which was open, and calling Ma&s;ter Winter on one &s;ide of him, and John Thomas on the other &s;ide, his man laid before him a great paper book, and withal Ma&s;ter Fletcher offer|ed him&s;elf to make a &s;ermon. Nay &s;oft, Ma&s;ter Fletcher, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t preach this day my&s;elf, although I have &s;mall &s;kill in preaching. Well, all ye the company, here are ye, or not? An&s;wer was made, that they were all here. Then commanded he every &s;hips company &s;everally to &s;tand together; which was al&s;o done. Then, &s;aid he, My Ma&s;ters, I am a very bad orator, for my bringing up hath not been in learning; but what &s;o I &s;hall here &s;peak, let every man take good notice of, and let him write it down, for I will &s;peak nothing but what I will an&s;wer it in England, yea, and before her Maje&s;ty, as I have it here already &s;et down [but whether it were in his book or not, that I know not, but this was the effect of it, and very near the words]: Thus it is, my Ma&s;ters, that we're

very far from our country and friends; we are compa&s;&s;ed in on every &s;ide with our ene|mies; wherefore we are not to make &s;mall reckoning of a man, for we cannot have a man if we would give for him ten thou&s;and pounds; wherefore we mu&s;t have the&s;e mutinies and di&s;contents that are grown among&s;t us redre&s;&s;|ed; for, by the life of God, it doth even take my wits from me to think on it. Here is &s;uch controver&s;y between the &s;ailors and the gentlemen, and &s;uch &s;tomaching between the gentlemen and &s;ailors, that it doth even make me mad to hear it. But, my Ma&s;ters, I mu&s;t have it cea&s;e; for I mu&s;t have the gentle|men to haul and draw with the mariners, and the mariners with the gentlemen: and let us &s;hew ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;elves to be all of a company; and let us not give occa&s;ion to the enemy to re|joice at our decay and overthrow. I would know him that would refu&s;e to &s;et his hand to a rope; but I tru&s;t there is not any &s;uch here; and, as gentlemen are very nece&s;&s;ary for government &s;ake on the voyage, &s;o have I &s;hipt them for that purpo&s;e, and to &s;ome further intent; and yet, though I know &s;ailors to be the mo&s;t envious people of the world, and &s;o unruly without government, yet may not I be without them. Al&s;o, if there be any here willing to return home, let me under|&s;tand of them; and here is the Marygold, a &s;hip that I can very well &s;pare, I will fur|ni&s;h her to &s;uch as will return with the mo&s;t

[Well, yet the voice was, that none would return; they would all take &s;uch part as he did.] Well, then, my Ma&s;ters, quoth he, Came ye all forth with your own good wills, or no? They an&s;wered, All, willingly. At who&s;e hands, my Ma&s;ters, take ye to receive your wages? At yours, an&s;wered the company. Then, &s;aid he, how &s;ay you, will you take wages, or &s;tand to my courte&s;y? To your courte&s;y, good Captain, was the reply. Then he commanded the &s;teward to the Elizabeth to bring him the key of the &s;tores, the which he did; then, turning him unto Ma&s;ter Win|ter, he &s;aid, Ma&s;ter Winter, I do here di&s;|charge you of your Captain&s;hip; and &s;o in brief he &s;aid to all the Officers. Then Ma&s;ter Winter and John Thomas a&s;ked him what &s;hould move him to di&s;place them? He a&s;ked in return, whether they could give any rea&s;on why he &s;hould not do &s;o? So willing them to content them&s;elves, he willed &s;ilence in tho&s;e matters, &s;aying, Ye &s;ee here the great di&s;|orders

But &s;ee what God would have to be done; for her Maje&s;ty commanded, that of all men my Lord Trea&s;urer &s;hould have no knowledge of this voyage, and to &s;ee that his own mouth hath declared that he had given him a plot thereof. But, truly, my Ma&s;ters, and as I am a gentleman, there &s;hall no more die; I will lay my hand on no more, although there be here who have de|&s;erved as much as he; and &s;o charging one Worrall that was pre&s;ent, that his ca&s;e was wor&s;e than Doughty's, who, in Ma&s;ter Doughty's extremities, was one of Drake's chief confellows, who, humbling him&s;elf to Drake, even upon his knees, prayed him to be good unto him. Well, well, Worrall, &s;aid he, you and I &s;hall talk well enough of this matter hereafter.

And, my Ma&s;ters, I mu&s;t tell you, I do know them as my very good friends; but to &s;ay that they were the fitters forth of this voyage, or that it was by their means, I tell you it was nothing &s;o. But, indeed, thus it was, My Lord of E&s;&s;ex wrote in my commen|dation unto Secretary Wal&s;ingham more than I was worthy; but by like I had de&s;erved &s;ome|what at his hands, and he thought me in his let|ters a fit man to &s;erve again&s;t the Spaniards for my practice and experience that I had in that trade; whereupon, indeed, Secretary Wal&s;ing|ham did come to con&s;ult with his Lord&s;hip, and declared unto him, that for that her Ma|je&s;ty had received divers injuries of the King of Spain, for the which, &s;he de&s;ired to have &s;ome revenge; and withal, he &s;hewed me a plot, willing me to &s;et my hand, and to write down where I thought he might mo&s;t be an|noyed; but I told him &s;ome part of my mind, but refu&s;ed to &s;et my hand to any thing, affirm|ing, that her Maje&s;ty was mortal, and that, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to take her Maje&s;ty away, it might &s;o be that &s;ome per&s;on might reign that might be in league with the king of Spain, and then will mine own Hand be a witne&s;s again&s;t my&s;elf. Then was I very &s;hortly after, and on an evening, &s;ent for unto her Maje&s;ty by Se|cretary Wal&s;ingham; and, the next day, com|ing
<PB N="96" REF="165">
to her Maje&s;ty, the&s;e, or the like words, &s;he &s;aid, Drake, &s;o it is that I would gladly be revenged on the King of Spain for divers injuries that I have received: and &s;aid fur|ther, that he was the only man that might do this exploit, and withal craved his advice therein, who told her Maje&s;ty of the &s;mall good that was to be done in Spain, but the only way was to annoy him by his Indies. Then, with many more words, he &s;hewed forth a bill of her Maje&s;ty's adventure of 1000 crowns, which, however, he &s;aid at &s;ome time before, that her Maje&s;ty did give him towards his charges. He &s;hewed al&s;o a bill of Ma&s;ter Hatton's adventure, and divers let|ters of credit that had pa&s;&s;ed in his behalf; but he never let them come out of his own hands. He &s;aid al&s;o, that her Maje&s;ty did &s;wear by her crown, <HI>That, if any within her realm did give the King of Spain hereof to un|der&s;tand (as &s;he &s;u&s;pected but two), they &s;hould lo&s;e their heads therefore.</HI> And now, Ma&s;ters, &s;aid he, let us con&s;ider what we have done: <HI>We have now &s;et together by the ears three mighty Princes, namely, her Maje&s;ty, the Kings of Spain and Portugal; and, if this voyage &s;hould not have good &s;ucce&s;s, we &s;hould not only be a &s;corning, or a reproachful &s;coffing &s;tock unto our enemies, but al&s;o a great</HI> BLOT <HI>to our whole coun|try for ever; and, what triumph would it be to Spain and Portugal; and again, the like would never be attempted.</HI> And now, re&s;toring every
<PB N="97" REF="166">
man again to his former office, he ended: thus &s;hewing the company that he would &s;atisfy every man, or el&s;e he would &s;ell all that he ever had even unto his plate; for, quoth he, I have good rea&s;on to promi&s;e, and am be&s;t able to perform it; for, I have &s;ome|what of mine own in England; and, be&s;ides that, I have as much adventure in this voyage as three of the be&s;t what&s;oever; and, if it &s;o be, that I never come home, yet will her Ma|je&s;ty pay every man his wages, whom indeed you and I all came to &s;erve; and, for to &s;ay you came to &s;erve me, I will not give you thanks; for it is only her Maje&s;ty that you &s;erve; and this voyage is only her fitting forth: &s;o willing all men to be friends, he willed them to depart about their bu&s;ine&s;s. The 8th of Augu&s;t, they weighed anchor and departed; but, the day before, he came on board the Elizabeth, and &s;wore very ve|hemently, I know not upon what occa&s;ion, that he would hang to the number of 30 in the fleet that had de&s;erved it: and then again charged Worrall that his ca&s;e was wor&s;e than Doughty's, and that by God's wounds he had de&s;erved to be hanged. And, Ma&s;ter Winter, &s;aid he, where is your man Uly&s;&s;es? By God's life, if he were my man, I would cut off his ears: nay, by God's wounds, I would hang him; but wherefore truly I do not know."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="167">Nothing can be a clearer proof that Drake had no Government Commi&s;&s;ion than the above account. In his &s;peech, which the writer &s;ays is nearly in his own words, he does not &s;o much as pretend to have received any Commi&s;&s;ion, only a private intimation from the Queen and Wal|&s;ingham, that her Maje&s;ty wanted to be reveng|ed of divers injuries received from the King of Spain, but was countenancing four or five piratical plunderers to rob innocent people, a princely way for one Sovereign to take revenge of another, in times of profound peace? It was, indeed, a pitiful connivance in Queen Elizabeh to engage 1000 crowns in a piratical adventure of this kind, and what could never have been credited of that magnanimous Prince&s;s, had &s;he not afterwards approved of his piracy, by going aboard his &s;hip, and openly approving what, it was even then &s;aid, lea&s;t became a trading nation to encourage, the breach of treaties, and piratical practices. But, it is remarkable, that five months elap&s;ed after his return to England before her Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure was publicly known; during which time men talked var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|ou&s;ly of the expedition, and the fate of Drake &s;eemed to hang in &s;u&s;pence; &s;o true proved Doughty's prediction, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Queen's Ma|je&s;ty and Council might be corrupted."</Q></P>
<P>That Drake bore no naval Commi&s;&s;ion ap|pears &s;till more clearly, from his di&s;placing the Captains and Officers of all his &s;hips without de|manding from them their Commi&s;&s;ions; from his
<PB N="99" REF="168">
li&s;ting his men, not for any ho&s;tile expedition, but for a trading voyage to Alexandria; and from his a&s;king them, before his &s;etting &s;ail from the Port of St. Julian to enter the South Seas, from whom they expected their wages. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it follows inconte&s;tibly, that, it he had a naval Commi&s;&s;ion, he was the only Officer in the fleet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one;&mdash;Doughty, whom he beheaded, and who, before their fal|ling out, was &s;econd in command, bore no naval Commi&s;&s;ion; and, it is more than probable, that this gentleman's que&s;tioning the Commi&s;&s;ion of Drake was the real cau&s;e of his death, as Drake more than once charges him with the overthrow of the voyage, which he could no otherwi&s;e effect than by di&s;crediting a Commi&s;&s;ion, on the au|thority of which both Officers and men were to be per&s;uaded to plunder a people at peace with their nation, and without which every man was liable to be executed for piracy, whenever he &s;hould be overpowered.</P>
<P>It were needle&s;s for us to enlarge our remarks; every reader has now the &s;ubject before him, and every reader will form a judgment for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What we have &s;aid, in con&s;equence of having traced this tran&s;action from beginning to end, may &s;eem to cla&s;h with the opinion we previ|ou&s;ly entertained of Drake's humanity, courage, and kindne&s;s to his followers, but will not &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the nature of periodical writings, where one part of the work is nece&s;&s;arily printed off before the
<PB N="100" REF="169">
other is written. In pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of this voyage, new authors have been con&s;ulted, and new lights collected, which have enabled us to detect not only the errors of other writers, but al&s;o to correct our own; and, from the &s;equel of this voyage, we may venture to foretel, that the reader will concur in &s;entiment with us, that, though Drake was bold, he was not ho|ne&s;t; that, though he did not kill tho&s;e he plun|dered and had no motive to de&s;troy, he &s;pared none who oppo&s;ed his de&s;igns, or who did not pay implicit obedience to his arbitrary will; that, though he was an able &s;eaman, he was a jealous rival; and that, though he was a gallant leader, he was a mo&s;t tyrannical Commander. We &s;hall now accompany him to the South Seas, where the Spaniards, not &s;u&s;pecting an enemy, were in no condition to defend them&s;elves again&s;t his attacks.</P>
<P>Drake having reduced the number of his &s;hips to three, they left the port, and on Augu&s;t the 20th entered the Straits of Magellan, in which they &s;truggled with contrary winds, and the various dangers which the intricacy of that winding pa&s;&s;age expo&s;ed them to, till night, when they had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t narrow, and had entered a wider &s;ea, where they di&s;covered an i&s;land, to which they gave the name of Elizabeth, in ho|nour of their &s;overeign. On the 24th they came to an i&s;land, in which they found &s;uch an infinite number of birds, &s;ince called penguins, that they killed 3000 of them in one day. This bird, of
<PB N="101" REF="170">
which they then knew not the name, they de|&s;cribe as &s;omewhat le&s;s than a wild goo&s;e, with|out feathers, and covered with a kind of down, unable to fly or ri&s;e from the ground, but ca|pable of running and &s;wimming with amazing celerity. They feed on fi&s;hes in the &s;ea, and come to land only to re&s;t in the day, and lay their eggs, which, according to later voyagers, they depo&s;it in holes, as regularly di&s;per&s;ed and as numerous as the cells in a bee-hive.</P>
<P>From the&s;e i&s;lands to the South Sea the &s;trait becomes very crooked and narrow; &s;o that &s;ometimes by the interpo&s;ition of head-lands the pa&s;&s;age &s;eems entirely &s;hut up. To double the&s;e capes they found it very difficult, on account of the frequent variations to be made in the cour&s;e. Here are, indeed, as Magellan ob&s;erves, many harbours; but in mo&s;t of them no bottom is to be found, which, however, does not &s;eem veri|fied by experience; the harbours being in ge|neral good, though the tides and bla&s;ts con|tinually ru&s;hing in from various directions cre|ate the danger. The land on both &s;ides ri&s;es into innumerable mountains; the tops of them were encircled with clouds and vapours, which, being congealed, fall down in &s;now, and increa&s;e their height by hardening into ice; an ob&s;ervation which might naturally occur to Drake, who pa&s;&s;ed the &s;trait in their winter before the &s;nows were di&s;&s;olved. However, even at that &s;ea&s;on, which an&s;wers to our February, they found the vallies, in &s;ome places, green, fruitful, and
<PB N="102" REF="171">
plea&s;ant. Anchoring in a bay near Cape For|ward, Drake, imagining the &s;trait quite &s;hut up, went in his boat to endeavour to find &s;ome other pa&s;&s;age out; and, having found an inlet towards the North, was returning to his &s;hips; but curio&s;ity &s;oon prevailed upon him to &s;top for the &s;ake of ob&s;erving a canoe or boat with &s;everal natives of the country in it. He could not at a di&s;tance help admiring the form of this little ve&s;&s;el, which &s;eemed inclining to a &s;emi|circle, the &s;tern and prow &s;tanding up, and the body &s;inking inward; but much greater was his wonder, when, upon a nearer in&s;pection, he found it made only with the barks of trees, &s;ewed together with thongs of &s;eal-&s;kins, &s;o arti|ficially, that &s;carcely any water entered the &s;eams.</P>
<P>The people were well &s;haped, and painted like tho&s;e who have been already de&s;cribed. On the land they had a hut built with poles, and covered with &s;kins, in which they had wa|ter-ve&s;&s;els and other uten&s;ils, made likewi&s;e with the barks of trees. Among the&s;e people they had an opportunity of remarking, what is frequently ob&s;ervable in &s;avage countries, how natural &s;agacity and unwearied indu&s;try may &s;upply the want of &s;uch manufactures or natu|tural productions, as appear to us ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life. Though the inha|bitants were wholly &s;trangers to iron and to the u&s;e we make of it, yet, in&s;tead of it, they &s;ub&s;tituted the &s;hell of a mu&s;cle, of pro|digious
<PB N="103" REF="172">
&s;ize, found upon their coa&s;ts. This they ground upon a &s;tone to an edge, which was &s;o firm and &s;olid, that neither wood nor &s;tone were able to re&s;i&s;t it. With in&s;truments made of &s;hells, the&s;e &s;imple people were able to perform all their mechanic operations; nor do they &s;eem &s;o deformed and ugly as our late voyagers repre&s;ent them, who being, perhaps, more refined than tho&s;e who &s;ailed with Cap|tain Drake, might fancy a greater difference be|tween them&s;elves and the&s;e &s;avages than in na|ture there really is.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion we cannot forbear remark|ing, that, though Drake entered the &s;trait in what is accounted the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ea|&s;on, yet he pa&s;&s;ed it in &s;ixteen days, though, at that time, wholly unknown; a pa&s;&s;age the more extraordinary, as none of our late voyagers made it in le&s;s than thirty-&s;ix days in the middle of &s;ummer, and Captain Wallis was at lea&s;t four months in making it.</P>
<P>Drake, as has been &s;aid, having taken a &s;ur|vey of the country from Cape Forward, conti|nued his cour&s;e to the North-we&s;t-ward, and, on the &s;ixth of September, entered the great South Sea, on which no Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el had ever been navigated before; and propo&s;ed to have direct|ed his cour&s;e towards the Line, that his men, who had &s;uffered by the &s;everity of the climate, might recover their &s;trength in a warmer lati|tude. But his de&s;ign was &s;carce formed, before it was fru&s;trated; for on September the &s;eventh,
<PB N="104" REF="173">
after an eclip&s;e of the moon, a &s;torm aro&s;e &s;o violent that it left them little hopes of &s;urviv|ing it: nor was its fury &s;o dreadful as its conti|nuance; for it la&s;ted, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, thirty-two days, in which time they were driven more than 200 leagues out of their cour&s;e, without being able either to avail them|&s;elves of their &s;ails, or make u&s;e of their anchors.</P>
<P>In this &s;torm, on the 30th of September, the Marigold, Captain Thomas, was &s;eparated from them; and on the 7th of October, having en|tered a harbour, where they hoped for &s;ome in|termi&s;&s;ion of their fatigues, they were in a few hours forced out to &s;ea again by a violent gu&s;t, at which time they lo&s;t &s;ight of the Elizabeth, Captain Winter, who&s;e crew, as was afterwards di&s;covered, wearied with labour, and di&s;cou|raged with the pro&s;pect of future dangers, re|covered the &s;traits the day following, and, re|turning by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age through which they came, &s;ailed along the coa&s;t of Brazil, and, in the year following, arrived in England.</P>
<P>They were now driven &s;outhward 55 degrees, where they di&s;covered a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, in one of which they anchored and &s;taid two days, to the great refre&s;hment of the crew, having met with excellent water, and plenty of greens. Not far di&s;tant from this bay they entered ano|ther, where they beheld &s;ome naked inhabitants ranging along the coa&s;t in their canoes in &s;earch of provi&s;ions. With the&s;e they exchanged
<PB N="105" REF="174">
&s;ome toys for &s;uch refre&s;hments as they had to &s;pare.</P>
<P>And now, being furni&s;hed with wood and wa|ter, they again &s;et &s;ail, and were, by a new &s;torm, driven to the latitude of 57 degrees, when they beheld the extremities of the Ame|rican coa&s;t, and the confluence of the Atlantic and Southern oceans. Here they arrived on the 28th of October, and at la&s;t were ble&s;t with the &s;ight of a calm &s;ea, having, for almo&s;t two months, endured &s;uch a &s;torm, as no voyager has given an account of, and &s;uch as in that part of the world, though accu&s;tomed to hurri|canes, the inhabitants were unacquainted with.</P>
<P>On the 30th of October, they &s;teered towards the place appointed for the rendezvouz of the fleet, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, which was in 30 degrees &s;outh; and, on the next day, di&s;co|vered two i&s;lands, &s;o well &s;tocked with fowls, that they victualled their &s;hips with them. Af|ter this &s;upply, they &s;ailed northward, along the coa&s;t of Peru, till they came to 30 degrees, where, finding neither &s;hips, nor any convenient port, they came to anchor Nov. the 29th, at Macao, an i&s;land inhabited by &s;uch Indians as the cruelty of their Spani&s;h conquerors had driven from the continent, to whom they ap|plied for water and provi&s;ions, offering them in return &s;uch things as they imagined mo&s;t like|ly to plea&s;e them. The Indians &s;eemed willing to traffic; and, having pre&s;ented them with
<PB N="106" REF="175">
fruits and two fat &s;heep, &s;hewed them a place where they might come for water.</P>
<P>Next morning, according to agreement, the Engli&s;h landed with their water-ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ent two men forward towards the place appointed, who, about the middle of the way, were &s;ud|denly attacked by the Indians and immediately &s;lain. Nor were the re&s;t of the company out of danger; for behind the rocks was lodged an ambu&s;h of 500 men, who, &s;tarting up from their retreat, di&s;charged their arrows into the boat with &s;uch dexterity, that every one of the crew was wounded by them. The &s;ea being then high, and hindering them from either re|tiring or making u&s;e of their weapons, Drake him&s;elf received an arrow under his eye, which pierced him almo&s;t to the brain; and another in his brea&s;t. The danger of the&s;e wounds was much increa&s;ed by the ab&s;ence of their &s;urgeon, who was in the Elizabeth, &s;o that they had none to a&s;&s;i&s;t them but a boy, who&s;e age did not admit of much &s;kill or experience; yet &s;o much were they favoured by Providence, that they all recovered. No rea&s;on could be a&s;|&s;igned for which the Indians &s;hould attack them with &s;o furious a &s;pirit of malignity, but that they mi&s;took them for Spaniards, who&s;e cruelties might very rea&s;onably incite tho&s;e to revenge, whom they had driven, by ince&s;&s;ant per&s;ecution, from their country, wa&s;ting im|men&s;e tracts of land by ma&s;&s;acre and deva&s;|tation. Nuno da Sylva adds, that none of
<PB N="107" REF="176">
the Indians were hurt by the Engli&s;h, though they came &s;o near the boat, as to &s;eize and carry off four of the oars.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of the &s;ame day they &s;et &s;ail, and on the 30th of November dropt anchor in Phillip's bay, where their boat, having been &s;ent out to di&s;cover the country, returned with an Indian in his canoe whom they had in|tercepted. He was of a graceful &s;tature, dre&s;t in a white coat or gown, reaching almo&s;t to his knees, very mild, humble, and docile; &s;uch as perhaps were all the Indians, till the Spa|niards taught them revenge, treachery, and cruelty. This Indian, having been kindly treated, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with pre&s;ents; and in|formed, as far as the Engli&s;h could make him under&s;tand, what they chiefly wanted, and what they were willing to give in return: Drake ordered his boat to attend him, and &s;et him &s;afe on &s;hore.</P>
<P>When he was landed, he made &s;igns for the boat to wait till his return, and meeting &s;ome of his countrymen, gave them &s;uch an account of his reception, that, within a few hours, &s;e|veral of them repaired with him to the boat, with fowls, eggs, and a hog; and with them one of their captains, who willingly came into the boat, and de&s;ired to be conveyed by the Engli&s;h to their &s;hip.</P>
<P>By this man Drake was informed that no &s;upplies were to be expected here; but that Southward, in a place to which he offered to be
<PB N="108" REF="177">
his pilot, there was great plenty. This pro|po&s;al was accepted, and on the 5th of Decem|ber, under the direction of the good-natured Indian, they came to anchor in the harbour called by the Spaniards Val Parizo, in 33 deg. 40 min. S. latitude, near the little town of St. Jago, where they met not only with &s;ufficient &s;tores of provi&s;ions, and with &s;torehou&s;es full of the wines of Chili, but with a &s;hip called the Captain of Morial, richly laden, having, toge|ther with large quantities of the &s;ame wine, &s;ome of the fine gold of Baldivia to the amount of three&s;core thou&s;and pezoes, each pezo of the value of eight &s;hillings, and a great cro&s;s of gold &s;et with emeralds. The Spaniards at fir&s;t, mi&s;taking the Engli&s;h for friends, invited them to fea&s;t with them; but &s;oon being undeceived, one of the crew jumped overboard, and alarm|ed the town; but the inhabitants, in&s;tead of making oppo&s;ition, fled ha&s;tily, and left what|ever was in the town a prize to the enemy. In the chapel Drake and his men found the mo&s;t valuable booty.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent three days here in &s;toring their &s;hips, and loading the money and effects, they departed, and landed their Indian pilot where they fir&s;t received him, after having rewarded him much above his expectations or de&s;ires. They had now little other anxiety than for their friends, who had been &s;eparated from them, and whom they now determined to &s;eek. But con&s;idering that, by entering every creek and
<PB N="109" REF="178">
harbour with their &s;hips, they expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to unnece&s;&s;ary dangers, and that their boat could not contain &s;uch a number as might defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Spaniards, they determined to &s;tation their &s;hip at &s;ome place where they might commodiou&s;ly build a pin|nace, which, being of light burden, might &s;afe|ly &s;ail where the &s;hip would be in danger of being &s;tranded; and, at the &s;ame time, carry a &s;ufficient force to re&s;i&s;t the enemy, and afford better accommodation than it was po&s;&s;ible to obtain in the boat. To this end, on the 19th of December, they entered a bay near Co|quimbo, a town inhabited by the Spaniards, who, di&s;covering them immediately, i&s;&s;ued out to the number of 100 hor&s;emen, with about 200 naked Indians running by their &s;ides. The Engli&s;h, ob&s;erving their approach, retired to their boat without any lo&s;s, except of one man, whom no per&s;ua&s;ions or intreaties could move to retire with the re&s;t, and who was therefore overtaken by the Spaniards, who thought to have taken him pri&s;oner, but, having an halbert in his hand, he manfully defended him&s;elf, till, being overpowered by numbers, he was run through the body with a lance. The Spaniards, exulting at the victory, ordered the Indians to draw the dead carca&s;e from the rock on which he fell, and in the &s;ight of the Eng|li&s;h beheaded it, and then cut off the right hand, and tore out the heart, which they carried away in triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="179">Leaving this place, they &s;oon found a harbour more &s;ecure and convenient, where they built their pinnace, in which Drake went to &s;eek his companions; but, finding the wind contrary, he was obliged to return in two days.</P>
<P>From hence they came to a port called Sarci|paxa, where, being landed, they found a Spa|niard a&s;leep with &s;ilver bars lying by him to the value of 4000 Spani&s;h ducats; notwith&s;tanding the in&s;ults which they had received from his coun|trymen, they did not think fit to di&s;turb this harmle&s;s man's repo&s;e, but, taking the &s;ilver, left him quietly to &s;leep out his nap.</P>
<P>Coa&s;ting along the &s;hore, they ob&s;erved a Spaniard driving eight Peruvian &s;heep, which on landing they found to be laden with &s;ilver, each &s;heep having 100lb weight in two leather bags acro&s;s his back. They delivered the poor animals of their heavy burdens, and lodged the bags in their own &s;hips.</P>
<P>Farther on lay &s;ome Indian towns, from which the inhabitants repaired to the &s;hip on floats made of &s;eal-&s;kin blown full of wind, two of which they fa&s;ten together, and, &s;itting be|tween them, row with great &s;wiftne&s;s, and car|ry con&s;iderable burdens. They very readily traded for gla&s;s and &s;uch trifles, with which the old and the young &s;eemed equally delighted.</P>
<P>Arriving at Marmarena on the 26th of Ja|nuary, Drake invited the Spaniards to traffic with him, which they accepted; and &s;upplied him with nece&s;&s;aries, &s;elling to him, among

other provi&s;ions, &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;heep which have been mentioned, who&s;e bulk is equal to that of a cow, and who&s;e &s;trength is &s;uch, that one of them can carry three tall men upon his back; their necks are like a camel's, and their heads like tho&s;e of our &s;heep. They are the mo&s;t u&s;eful animals of this country, not only affording excellent fleeces and whole&s;ome fle&s;h, but &s;erv|ing as carriers over rocks and mountains, where no other bea&s;t can travel; for their feet are of a particular form, which enables them to tread firm on the &s;teepe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;lippery places.</P>

<P>They continued their cour&s;e towards the North, and on the 7th of February arrived at Arica, in 8 deg. 30 min. S. latitude, and in this port found three &s;mall barks, in which they found 57 &s;labs of &s;ilver, each of the &s;ize and &s;hape of an ordinary brick, and weighing about 20lb. They took no pri&s;oners; for the crews, fearing no interlopers, were all on &s;hore carou&s;ing with one another. At this port the Spaniards were wont to land their merchandize, and to embark the &s;ilver, which was tran&s;ported from thence to Panama; but, &s;ince Drake's incur&s;ion, they carry their &s;ilver over land to Lima, and load no more trea|&s;ure here, except what they pay for the purcha&s;e of &s;uch merchandize as is brought from Europe to &s;upply their market. Wanting numbers to

a&s;&s;ault the town, they proceeded in their cour&s;e, and falling in with a &s;mall coa&s;ting-ve&s;&s;el, la|den with linen and other cloaths, Drake &s;up|plied his crew with what quantity of tho&s;e arti|cles they &s;tood in need of, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Spaniards with the remainder.</P>
<P>From hence they &s;ailed to Chuli; in which port there was a &s;hip that had 300,000 pezoes of &s;ilver in bars; but the Spaniards had &s;ent an ex|pre&s;s from Arica, to acquaint the Governor that Drake was upon the coa&s;t. This expre&s;s ar|rived at Chuli, ju&s;t two hours before Drake en|tered the port; in which time the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip had thrown his trea&s;ure overboard, and had &s;ecured him&s;elf and crew on &s;hore, leaving only one Indian on board to make the report. Drake, fearing the alarm would &s;pread fa&s;ter than he could &s;ail, lo&s;t no time in hazardous &s;earches, but in&s;tantly departed, and &s;teered for Lima, where they arrived on the 15th of February, and entered the harbour without re&s;i&s;tance, in which, according to &s;ome writers, there were thirty &s;ail of &s;hips; others &s;ay, twelve; but all agree, that &s;everal of them were of con&s;iderable force; &s;o that Drake's &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ted not in his &s;trength, but in his reputa|tion, which had &s;o intimidated the Spaniards, that the &s;ight of their own &s;uperiority could not rou&s;e them to oppo&s;ition. In&s;tances of &s;uch panic terrors are to be met with in other rela|tions; but as they are, for the mo&s;t part, quick|ly di&s;&s;ipated by rea&s;on and re&s;olution, a wi&s;e

Commander will rarely ground his hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s on them; and, perhaps, on this occa&s;ion, the Spaniards &s;carcely de&s;erve a &s;everer cen&s;ure for their cowardice, than Drake for his temerity. A writer of good authority, to reconcile the matter, tells us, that Drake took them at una|wares, and that the crews, as is u&s;ual in times of perfect &s;ecurity, were with their families on &s;hore; and many of tho&s;e who were ready to &s;ail, were taking leave of their friends. Be this as it may, all &s;eem to agree, that Drake made here a con&s;iderable booty, having taken from one &s;hip a che&s;t full of rials of plate, which he found concealed under the &s;teerage, and, from other &s;hips, &s;ilks and linen cloth to a con&s;ider|able value. He did not, however, remain long in this harbour, but ha&s;tened in pur&s;uit of the Cacafuego, which &s;hip had &s;ailed but three days before, and which, they were here informed, was bound to Paita. In the pur&s;uit, they fell in with another &s;hip, out of which they took a large quantity of gold, together with a crucifix of the &s;ame metal, richly adorned with emeralds. They continued the pur&s;uit; but, having gained intelligence, that, in&s;tead of Paita, &s;he was gone to Panama, Drake crouded all the &s;ail he could, and, to encourage the pur&s;uers, promi&s;ed, that whoever fir&s;t de&s;cried the prize &s;hould have his gold chain as a reward; which fell to the lot of his brother John. On the 1&s;t of March they came up with her, and, after exchanging a few &s;hot, they boarded her, and found not only a
<PB N="114" REF="184">
quantity of jewels, and thirteen che&s;ts of money, but eighty pounds weight of gold, and twenty-&s;ix tons of uncoined &s;ilver, with &s;ervices of wrought plate to a great value. In unlading this prize they &s;pent &s;ix days; and then di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing the Spaniards, &s;tood off again to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Lopez Vaz, a Spani&s;h writer, tells us, that in le&s;s than 24 hours after their departure from Lima in pur&s;uit of the Cacafuego, news was brought that Drake was upon the coa&s;t, but that the Governor had already a&s;&s;embled the force of the country to oppo&s;e his landing; and that, finding he had left the harbour, he ordered three &s;hips with &s;ix pieces of cannon (being all he could collect), and 250 men, to pur&s;ue him: but, the equipment of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els nece&s;&s;arily requiring time, Drake had gained the advantage of them: and, coming within &s;ight of the prize off Cape Franci&s;co, the Captain of which, Juan de Anton, a Bi&s;cayan, &s;eeing at a di&s;tance a &s;hip crouded with &s;ails, and imagining the Viceroy of Peru had di&s;patched her on &s;ome me&s;&s;age to him, &s;truck his &s;ails, and lay to till Drake approaching nearer, he di&s;covered his mi&s;take. He would then have made his e&s;cape, but Drake nearing him fa&s;t with his great ord|nance, again&s;t which the Captain could make no defence, he was con&s;trained to yield. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There was in this &s;hip, adds the Spaniard, eight hundred and fifty thou&s;and pezoes of &s;ilver, and forty thou&s;and pezoes of gold, all which &s;ilver and gold was cu&s;tomed: but what trea|&s;ure
<PB N="115" REF="185">
they had uncu&s;tomed, I know not; for many times they carry almo&s;t as much more as they pay cu&s;tom for; otherwi&s;e the King would take it from them, if they &s;hould be known to have any great &s;um; wherefore every &s;hip carries a bill of cu&s;tom, that the King may &s;ee it. All the trea&s;ure which Drake took was merchants and other mens goods, &s;aving 180,000 pezoes of the king's. He had al&s;o out of this &s;hip good &s;tore of victuals, with other nece&s;&s;aries, which were to be carried from Panama, and was five days in taking out &s;uch things as he needed.<P>"This done, he &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of New Spain, without going to Panama. The &s;hips that were &s;ent by the viceroy of Peru from Lima, arrived off Cape St. Franci&s;co 20 days after Drake had taken the Cacafuego, and had intelligence by a &s;hip coming from Pa|nama, which they met at the &s;aid Cape, that Francis Drake had taken the &s;hip with &s;ilver, and was not gone for Panama; whereupon the Commander of the three &s;hips, thinking that Captain Drake had been gone for the Straits of Magellan, directed his cour&s;e that way to &s;eek him."</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus Drake, changing his cour&s;e to the we&s;t, e&s;caped his enemies, and fell in with a &s;hip from the Ea&s;t Indies laden with &s;ilks, China ware, and cotton. The owner, a Spaniard, was on board, who pre&s;ented Drake with a falcon wrought in ma&s;&s;y gold, with an emerald &s;et in
<PB N="116" REF="186">
the brea&s;t of it, the large&s;t he had ever beheld. With this pre&s;ent, and a golden cup from the pilot, Drake was contented, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;hip, taking only four che&s;ts of China ware, which at that time was of great value in Europe.</P>
<P>On the 13th of March they came in &s;ight of land, which happened to be a &s;mall i&s;land about, two leagues from the main continent. There they found a harbour, and anchored in five fathom water, where they &s;taid till the 20th, on which day, a little coa&s;ting frigate pa&s;&s;ing by, was pur&s;ued by the pinnace, boarded, and taken. Being laden with &s;a&s;aparilla, honey, butter, and other country goods, Drake unloaded the &s;a&s;a|parilla, and in the room of it put the gold and &s;ilver from his own &s;hip, in order to heave her up, to new caulk her &s;ides, and &s;top her leaks; in which &s;ervice the crew were employed till the 26th of the &s;ame month, when having reloaded the cargo, and taken in a &s;ufficient quantity of wood and water, they continued their cour&s;e we&s;tward along the coa&s;t, taking the Spani&s;h frigate with them to bear them company.</P>
<P>On April 6, a little before &s;un-&s;et, they di&s;|covered a &s;hip, that held on her cour&s;e about two leagues to &s;eaward from the main land. To this &s;hip they gave chace, and before morning they neared her, and &s;uddenly boarded her while the men &s;lept. Being ma&s;ters of this prize with|out re&s;i&s;tance, they ordered the pri&s;oners on board their own &s;hip, among whom was one Don Franci&s;co Xarate, who meant to &s;ail to Panama,
<PB N="117" REF="187">
and from thence to China, with the letters and patents that were found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (among which were the letters of the King of Spain to the Governor of the Philippines); as al&s;o the &s;ea charts wherewith they were to be directed in their voyage, which were of admirable u&s;e to Drake in his return home. From this &s;hip they took great quantities of bale goods, and other valu|able merchandize, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. They al&s;o took a young negro girl, whom Drake or &s;ome of his companions having got with child, they afterwards inhumanly &s;et her on &s;hore on an i&s;land in their way home, ju&s;t as &s;he was ready to lie in; of which notice will be taken in its proper place. Having retained a Spani&s;h pilot from this &s;hip, they obliged him to direct them to a &s;afe harbour, where they might &s;upply them&s;elves with provi&s;ions for their intended voyage. This man brought them to the harbour of Anguatulco, or, as others write, Guatalco, where arriving on the 13th of April, they &s;taid till the 26th of the &s;ame month, and then &s;et &s;ail, having fir&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all their Spani&s;h pri|&s;oners, together with Nuno da Sylva, the Por|tugueze pilot, whom they brought from the Canaries, and who had &s;erved them faithfully in all their trials and dangers; in reward for which he was now abandoned by Drake to the mercy of the enemy. This man, when he landed on the continent, was fir&s;t carried to Mexico, and there put to the torture to make di&s;coveries. He was afterwards &s;ent pri&s;oner into Old Spain, and
<PB N="118" REF="188">
there examined; and, having given a faithful relation of all he knew, was relea&s;ed, and re|turned home to his own country, where he pub|li&s;hed, as has already been &s;aid, an account of the voyage as far as he went, which was after|wards tran&s;lated into all the European language; and univer&s;ally read.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Anguatulco, they had no &s;ooner landed than Drake with part of his men marched up to the town, where they found the chief magi&s;trate &s;itting in judgment upon a par|cel of poor &s;avages, and ready to pa&s;s &s;entence of death upon almo&s;t all of them, they being charged with a con&s;piracy to kill their ma&s;ters, and &s;et fire to the town. Drake changed the &s;cene, and made judges and criminals, without di&s;tinction, his pri&s;oners, conducting them all in proce&s;&s;ion to his &s;hip. Here he made the judge write an order to the Commanding Officer to deliver up the town, in which they found a great pot, &s;ays my author, as big as a bu&s;hel, full of rials of plate, a gold chain, and a few jewels. The gold chain was taken from a gen|tleman who was making his e&s;cape from the town, but was intercepted by an Engli&s;h &s;ailor, who rifled him of all the valuables he had about him, of which the gold chain was thought to be of the lea&s;t value.</P>
<P>Being now &s;ufficiently enriched, and having given over all hopes of finding their a&s;&s;ociates, and, perhaps, beginning to be infected with that de&s;ire of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure which is the natural

con&s;equence of wealth obtained by &s;ucce&s;sful villainy, or, what is &s;till more probable, being in fear of a &s;urprize before they had &s;ecured their booty, they began to con&s;ult about their return home; and, in pur&s;uance of Drake's advice, re&s;olved fir&s;t to find out &s;ome convenient harbour where they might more &s;afely lie and equip them&s;elves for the voyage, and then endeavour to di&s;cover a nearer pa&s;&s;age from the South Seas into the Atlantic Ocean; a pa&s;&s;age that would not only enable them to return home with full &s;ecurity, and in a &s;horter time, but would much facilitate the navigation into tho&s;e parts, and of cour&s;e immortalize their names.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e they had recour&s;e to a port in the i&s;land of Canes, where they met with fi&s;h, wood, and fre&s;h water; and, being &s;ufficiently &s;tored with other provi&s;ions, with which they had &s;upplied them&s;elves from their prizes and at Anguatulco, they &s;et &s;ail fir&s;t with a re&s;olution of &s;eeking a pa&s;&s;age by the north-we&s;t, and, if that failed, by the Moluccas, and thence, fol|lowing the cour&s;e of the Portugueze, to return by the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the fir&s;t re&s;olution, they &s;ailed about 600 leagues, till coming into the latitude of 43 deg. north, they found the air &s;o exce&s;&s;ive cold, that the men could no longer bear to handle the ropes to navigate the &s;hip: they, therefore, changed their cour&s;e till they came into the latitude of 38 deg. and 30 min. under which height they di&s;covered a very good har|bour,
<PB N="120" REF="191">
and, fortunately, had a favourable wind to enable them to enter it.</P>
<P>Here, on the 17th of June, they ca&s;t anchor, and, in a &s;hort time, had opportunities of ob&s;erv|ing that the natives of that country were not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than them&s;elves; for, the next day, there came a man rowing in his canoe towards the &s;hip, and, at a di&s;tance from it, made a long oration with very extraordinary ge&s;ticulations, and great appearance of vehemence; and, a little time af|terwards, made a &s;econd vi&s;it in the &s;ame man|ner; and then returning a third time, he pre|&s;ented them, after his harangue was fini&s;hed, with a kind of crown of black feathers, &s;uch as their kings wear upon their heads, and a ba&s;ket of ru&s;hes filled with a particular herb, both which he fa&s;tened to a &s;hort &s;tick, and threw into the boat: nor could he be prevailed upon to receive any thing in return, though pu&s;hed towards him upon a board, only he took up a hat that was flung in the water.</P>
<P>Three days afterwards, the &s;hip, having re|ceived &s;ome damage at &s;ea, was brought nearer to land, that her lading might be taken out; in order to which, the Engli&s;h, who had now learned not to commit their lives too negligently to the mercy of &s;avage nations, rai&s;ed a kind of fortification with earth and pali&s;&s;ades, and erect|ed their tents within it. All this was not be|held by the inhabitants without the utmo&s;t a&s;|toni&s;hment, which incited them to come down in crouds to the coa&s;t, with no other view, as it
<PB N="121" REF="192">
afterwards appeared, but to compliment the beautiful &s;trangers that had conde&s;cended to touch upon their country.</P>
<P>Drake, neither confiding too much in appear|ances, nor wholly di&s;tru&s;ting the friendly di&s;po|&s;ition of the inhabitants, directed them to lay a&s;ide their bows and arrows, and, on their ap|proach, pre&s;ented them with linen and other nece&s;&s;aries, of which he &s;hewed them the u&s;e. They then returned to their habitations, about three quarters of a mile from the Engli&s;h camp, where they made &s;uch loud and violent noi&s;es, that they were heard by the Engli&s;h, who had vanity enough to believe that they were paying them a kind of melancholy adoration.</P>
<P>Two days afterwards, they perceived the ap|proach of a far more numerous company, who &s;topt at the top of a hill which over-looked the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement, while one of them made a long oration, at the end of which all the a&s;&s;em|bly bowed their bodies, and pronounced the &s;yllable <HI>Oh</HI> with a &s;olemn tone, as by way of confirmation of what had been &s;aid by the ora|tor. Then the men laying down their bows, and leaving their women and children on the top of the hill, came down towards the tents, and &s;eemed tran&s;ported in the highe&s;t degree at the kindne&s;s of Drake, who received their gifts, and admitted them to his pre&s;ence. The wo|men at a di&s;tance appeared &s;eized with a kind of phrenzy, &s;uch as that of old among the Pa|gans in &s;ome of their religious ceremonies, and
<PB N="122" REF="193">
in honour as it &s;eemed of their gue&s;ts, tore their cheeks and bo&s;oms with their nails, and threw them&s;elves upon the &s;tones with their naked bodies.</P>
<P>Three days after this, on June 25, 1579, Drake received two Amba&s;&s;adors from the Hioh, or King, of the country, who, intending to vi&s;it the camp, required that &s;ome token might be &s;ent him of friend&s;hip and peace. This reque&s;t was readily complied with; and &s;oon after came the King, attended by a guard of about an hundred tall men, and preceded by an Officer of State, who carried a &s;ceptre made of black wood, adorned with chains made of a kind of bone or horn, which are marks of the highe&s;t honour among them. Behind him was the King him&s;elf, dre&s;&s;ed in a coat of bea&s;ts &s;kins, with a crown woven with feathers upon his head. His attendants followed, dre&s;&s;ed nearly in the &s;ame manner all but the crown; and after them came the common people, with ba&s;kets platted &s;o artificially that they held wa|ter, in which, by way of pre&s;ent, they brought roots and fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Drake, not lulled into &s;ecurity, ranged his men in order of battle, and waited their ap|proach, who coming nearer &s;tood &s;till, while the &s;cepter-bearer made an oration; at the conclu|&s;ion of which, they came again forward at the foot of the hill, and then the &s;cepter-bearer be|gan a &s;ong, which he accompanied with a dance, in both which the men joined, but the women

<PB N="123" REF="195">
danced without &s;inging. Drake now di&s;tru&s;ting them no longer, admitted them into his forti|fication, where they continued their &s;ong and dance a &s;hort time; and then both the King and &s;ome others of the company made a long harangue, in which it appeared, by the re&s;t of their behaviour, that they entreated them to ac|cept of the government of their country; and the King, with the concurrence of the re&s;t, placed the Crown upon Drake's head, graced him with the chains and other &s;igns of authority, and &s;a|luted him with the title of <HI>Hioh.</HI> The kingdom thus offered, though of no farther value to him than that it furni&s;hed him with pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;a|ries, Drake thought it not prudent for him to refu&s;e; and, therefore, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of Queen Elizabeth, not without ar|dent wi&s;hes that this acqui&s;ition might be of u&s;e to his native country. The kingdom being thus con&s;igned, and the grand affair at an end, the common people left their King and his Nobles with Drake, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves over the camp; and when they &s;aw any one that plea&s;ed them more than the re&s;t, they tore their fle&s;h and vented their outcries, as before, in token of reverence and re&s;pect. They then proceeded to &s;hew them their wounds and di&s;|ea&s;es, in hopes, perhaps, of a miraculous cure; to which the Engli&s;h, to benefit and undeceive them at the &s;ame time, applied &s;uch remedies as they u&s;ed on like occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="196">They were now grown confident and familiar, and came down to the camp every day, repeat|ing their ceremonies, till they were more fully informed how di&s;agreeable they were to tho&s;e who&s;e favour they were &s;o &s;tudious of obtaining. They then vi&s;ited them without ceremony, in|deed, but with a curio&s;ity &s;o ardent, that it left them no lei&s;ure to provide the nece&s;&s;aries of life, with which the Engli&s;h were, therefore, obliged to &s;upply them. They had, then, &s;ufficient op|portunity to remark the cu&s;tom and di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e new allies, whom they found tractable and benevolent, &s;trong of body far beyond the Engli&s;h, yet unfurni&s;hed with weapons either for a&s;&s;ault or defence, their bows being too weak for any thing but &s;port. Their dexterity in taking fi&s;h was &s;uch, that, if they &s;aw them &s;o near the &s;hore that they could come to them without &s;wimming, they never mi&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame curio&s;ity that had brought them in &s;uch crouds to the &s;hore, now induced Drake and &s;ome of his companions to travel up into their country, which they found at &s;ome di&s;tance from the coa&s;t very fruitful, filled with large deer, and abounding with a peculiar kind of cunnies &s;maller than ours, with tails like rats, paws &s;uch as tho&s;e of a mole, and bags under their chins, in which they carry provi&s;ions to their young.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the inhabitants were round holes dug in the ground, from the brink of which they rai&s;e rafters, or poles, &s;helving to|wards the middle, where they all met in a
<PB N="125" REF="197">
ridge, and are crampt together; the people lie upon ru&s;hes, and make the fire in the middle of the hou&s;e, letting the &s;moke fly out at the door. The men are generally naked; but the women make a kind of petticoat of bulru&s;hes, which they comb like hemp, and throw the &s;kin of a deer over their &s;houlders. They are very mode&s;t, tractable, and obedient to their hu&s;|bands. The &s;oil is but badly cultivated; but contentment &s;eems to prevail in a very eminent degree among all ranks of this happy people.</P>
<P>The land was named by Drake New Albion, from its white cliffs, in which it bore &s;ome re|&s;emblance to his native country, and the whole hi&s;tory of the re&s;ignation of it to the Engli&s;h was engraven on a piece of bra&s;s, then nailed on a po&s;t, and fixed up before their departure, which being now di&s;covered by the people to be near at hand, they could not forbear perpe|tual lamentations.</P>
<P>When the Engli&s;h on the 23d of July weighed anchor, they &s;aw them climbing to the tops of hills, that they might keep them in &s;ight, and ob&s;erved fires lighted up in many parts of the country, on which, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;acrifices were offered.</P>
<P>Near to this harbour, they touched at &s;ome i&s;lands where they found abundance of &s;eals; and, de&s;pairing now to find any pa&s;&s;age through the northern regions, they, after a general con|&s;ultation, determined to &s;teer away to the Mo|luccas; and, &s;etting &s;ail July 25, they held a
<PB N="126" REF="198">
we&s;tern cour&s;e for 68 days without &s;ight of land; and, on September 30, arrived within view of &s;ome i&s;lands, about 20 deg. northward from the Line, from whence the inhabitants re&s;orted to them in canoes hollowed in the middle, and rai&s;ed at both ends &s;o high above the water, that they &s;eemed almo&s;t a &s;emi-circle; they were burni&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hone like ebony, and were kept &s;teady by a piece of tim|ber fixed on each &s;ide of them. The fir&s;t com|pany that came brought fruits, bananas, and other things of no great value, with an appear|ance of traffic, and exchanged their lading for other commodities with great &s;how of hone&s;ty and friend&s;hip. But having, as they imagined, laid all &s;u&s;picion a&s;leep, they &s;ent another fleet of canoes, of which the crews behaved with all the in&s;olence of &s;avages, and all the rapacity of thieves; for, whatever was &s;uffered to come into their hands, they &s;eemed to con&s;ider as their own, and would neither pay for it nor re&s;tore it: and, at length, finding the Engli&s;h re&s;olved to admit them no longer, they di&s;charged a &s;hower of &s;tones from their boats, which in&s;ult Drake prudently and generou&s;ly returned, by firing his great guns without hurting them; at which they were &s;o terrified, that they leaped into the water, and hid them&s;elves under their canoes.</P>
<P>Here we cannot help remarking how nearly this de&s;cription agrees with the accounts given by the late navigators, of the temper and di&s;po|&s;ition of the inhabitants of the i&s;lands lately di&s;|covered

between the Tropics. Drake, indeed, found the firing of his guns without hurting them, &s;ufficient to intimidate the&s;e ignorant people; but our later voyagers have thought their vengeance not complete for any &s;light in|&s;ult, without murdering them by whole&s;ale to &s;trike them with terror. The writer of the late voyages &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our men &s;hewed as much im|patience to de&s;troy them as a &s;port&s;man to kill his game."</Q></P>
<P>Having for &s;ome time but little wind, they did not arrive at the Moluccas till the 3d of November; and then, de&s;igning to touch at Tidore, as they coa&s;ted along the i&s;land Mutua, belonging to the King of Ternate, they were vi&s;ited by his Viceroy, who informed them, that it would be more advantageous for them to have recour&s;e to his ma&s;ter for &s;upplies, than to the Portugue&s;e, with whom he was at enmity. Drake was, by the arguments of the Viceroy, prevailed upon to alter his re&s;olution; and, on November the 5th, ca&s;t anchor before Ternate. Scarce was he arrived, before the Viceroy, with others of the chief nobility, came out in three large barges rowed by forty men on each &s;ide, to conduct the &s;hip into a &s;afe harbour; and, &s;oon after, the King him&s;elf, having received a velvet cloak by a me&s;&s;enger from Drake, as a token of peace, came with &s;uch a retinue and dignity of appearance, as was not expected in tho&s;e remote parts of the world. He was received with di&s;|charges of cannon, and every kind of mu&s;ic,
<PB N="128" REF="200">
with which he was &s;o much delighted, that he invited the performers on board his barge.</P>
<P>The King was of a graceful &s;tature and royal carriage, of a mild a&s;pect and low voice. His attendants were dre&s;&s;ed in white cotton or cal|lico, of whom &s;ome, who&s;e age gave them a ve|nerable appearance, &s;eemed as coun&s;ellors, and the re&s;t officers or nobles. His guards were not ignorant of fire-arms, but had not many among them, being equipped for the mo&s;t part with bows and darts. The King, having &s;pent &s;ome time in admiring the new objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves, retired as &s;oon as the &s;hip was brought to anchor, and promi&s;ed to return on the day following; and in the mean time the inhabitants, having leave to traffic, brought down provi&s;ions in great abundance. The King came not aboard, according to his promi&s;e, but &s;ent his brother to excu&s;e him, and withal to invite Drake a&s;hore, propo&s;ing to &s;tay him&s;elf as an ho&s;tage for his return. Drake declined going him&s;elf, but &s;ent &s;ome gentlemen of his retinue in company with the King's brother, and kept the Viceroy till their return.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen were received by another of the King's brothers, and conducted in great &s;tate to the ca&s;tle, where there was a court of, at lea&s;t 1000 per&s;ons, among whom were three|&s;core ancient men, privy coun&s;ellors to the King; and on each &s;ide of the gate without, &s;tood four old men of foreign countries, who &s;erved as interpreters in commerce. In a &s;hort
<PB N="129" REF="201">
time appeared the King him&s;elf, dre&s;t in Cloth of gold, with his hair woven into gold ringlets, a chain of gold upon his neck, and on his fingers rings very artificially &s;et with diamonds and jew|els of great value. Over his head was borne a rich canopy; and by his chair of &s;tate &s;tood a page with a fan &s;et with &s;apphires, to moderate the exce&s;s of the heat. Here he received the compliments of the Engli&s;h, and then honoura|bly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. The ca&s;tle, which they had &s;ome opportunity of ob&s;erving, &s;eemed of no great force. It was built by the Portugue&s;e, who, attempting to reduce this kingdom into ab&s;olute &s;ubjection, murdered the King, and intended to pur&s;ue their plot by the de&s;truction of all his &s;ons. But the general abhorrence which cruelty and perfidy naturally excite, armed the whole nation again&s;t them, and pro|cured their total expul&s;ion from all the do|minions of Ternate, which, from that time, increa&s;ing in power, continued to make new conque&s;ts, and to deprive them of other acqui|&s;itions.</P>
<P>Here they &s;hipt between four and five tons of cloves, intending to bring them to Europe. While they lay before Ternate, a gentleman came on board attended by his Portugue&s;e in|terpreter. He was dre&s;&s;ed &s;omewhat in the Eu|ropean manner, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf from the natives of Ternate, or any country they had ever yet &s;een, by his civility and quick comprehen&s;ion. Such a vi&s;itant may ea&s;ily be
<PB N="130" REF="202">
imagined to excite their curio&s;ity, which he gratified by informing them that he was a na|tive of China, of the family of the King then upon the throne; and that being accu&s;ed of a capital crime, of which, though he was inno|cent, he had not &s;ufficient evidence to clear him&s;elf, he had petitioned the Emperor that he might not be expo&s;ed to a trial; but that his cau&s;e might be referred to Divine Providence; and that he might be allowed to leave his country, with a prohibition again&s;t returning, unle&s;s heaven, in atte&s;tation of his innocence, &s;hould enable him to bring back to the King &s;ome intelligence that might be to the honour and advantage of the Empire of China. In &s;earch of &s;uch information he had now &s;pent three years, and left Tidore for the &s;ake of conver&s;ing with the Engli&s;h General, from whom he hoped to receive &s;uch accounts as would enable him to return with honour and &s;afety. Drake, whether he credited or di&s;believed his &s;tory, cau&s;ed a recital to be made by one of the company, who talked the language of the in|terpreter, of &s;uch adventures and ob&s;ervations as he judged would be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to his vi|&s;itor, to all which the Chine&s;e Exile gave the ut|mo&s;t attention; and, having cau&s;ed them to be repeated a &s;econd time, to impre&s;s them in his mind, thanked the Creator of the World for the knowledge he had gained. He then pro|po&s;ed to the General to &s;ail to his country, to which he willingly undertook to be his pilot,
<PB N="131" REF="203">
but Drake could not be induced to prolong his voyage.</P>
<P>He therefore &s;et &s;ail, on Nov. the 9th, in que&s;t of a more convenient harbour, where he might clean and refit his &s;hip, which, by the length of the voyage, and the heat of the climate, was now become foul and leaky. Directing his cour&s;e &s;outhward, he &s;oon fell in with an unin|habited i&s;land, which, by its appearance, pro|mi&s;ed fair to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. At a di&s;tance it looked like a beautiful grove; the trees were large, &s;trait, and lofty; but, what was more extraordinary, they were inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing number of &s;hining flies, that the whole i&s;land in the night &s;eemed to glow with fire. Here they found a convenient haven, and here they landed and continued 26 days. They found upon this i&s;land tortoi&s;e, but of a mon|&s;trous &s;ize, and various &s;orts of fruits of a de|licious flavour.</P>
<P>Leaving this place on the 12th of Decem|ber, they cruelly de&s;erted the unhappy mulatto girl, whom they had taken for their plea&s;ure from a &s;hip that fell into their hands on the coa&s;t of New Spain. They had, at the &s;ame time, taken on board a negroe youth, who they thought might be &s;erviceable to them in conver&s;ing with his nation in their way home; but, finding him of little or no u&s;e on board, and provi&s;ions beginning to fail, they pretended to &s;end this &s;imple couple far into the country to gather fruits, and, in the mean time, un|moored
<PB N="132" REF="204">
the &s;hip, and hoi&s;ted &s;ail; and, before the return of the victims, were out of &s;ight of their tears, and out of hearing of their cries: a melancholy in&s;tance this of the depravity of man's heart, and of the relentle&s;s cruelty of minds addicted to rapine and lu&s;t. The poor girl, not yet fifteen, was ready to be delivered of an innocent babe; and the youth, not twen|ty, was the only re&s;ource in the mid&s;t of her di&s;tre&s;s. What befel them cannot be known: but Providence &s;eemed to puni&s;h the perfidy of the crew by a &s;evere trial of their fortitude &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Having a wind not very favourable, they hap|pened to be intangled among a multitude of i&s;lands, inter&s;per&s;ed with dangerous &s;hallows, till January the 9th, 1580. When they thought them&s;elves clear, and were &s;ailing along with a bri&s;k gale; they were, at the beginning of the night, &s;uddenly &s;urprized in their cour&s;e by a &s;udden &s;hock, the cau&s;e of which was in&s;tantly di&s;covered, for they were thrown upon a con|cealed rock, and, by the &s;peed of their cour&s;e, fixed too fa&s;t for any hope of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>Here the intrepidity of Drake was &s;haken, and his dexterity baffled: here all the horrors of mind, attendant on con&s;cious guilt, concurred to aggravate the di&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e who were in&s;tru|mental in abandoning the harmle&s;s &s;laves. Tho&s;e who were innocent reproached the guilty with being the authors of their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; and, among the re&s;t, Mr. Fletcher, the Chaplain, exclaimed again&s;t the Captain, as one who&s;e crimes of murder and lu&s;t had brought down
<PB N="133" REF="205">
divine vengeance on all the company. Drake, who knew well how to di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment, judging this an improper time to encourage di&s;putes, endeavoured, by every means in his power, to appea&s;e the increa&s;ing animo&s;ity. To pre&s;erve, therefore, the minds of the company at re&s;t, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to keep their hands employed, and, for that purpo&s;e, ordered the pumps to be con&s;tantly plied. Convinced by this experiment that the water did not gain upon them in the hold, he conceived hopes, that, by lightening the &s;hip, they might po&s;|&s;ibly be able to heave her off. He knew it would be in vain to per&s;uade them to part with their trea&s;ure, and, therefore, he fir&s;t cau&s;ed the guns to be thrown overboard, and then the &s;pices; and, afterwards, the water-ca&s;ks to be bulged, being in hopes, that, if they could be relea&s;ed, water might again be &s;upplied from the neighbouring i&s;lands, &s;ome of which were at no great di&s;tance. His next attempt was to di&s;|cover about the &s;hallows &s;ome place where they might &s;ix an anchor, in order to bring their &s;hip to, and, by that means, clear her from the rock: but, upon examination, it was found that the rock on which they had &s;truck, ro&s;e, as many others in tho&s;e &s;eas do, almo&s;t perpendicular, and that there was no anchorage, nor any bottom to be fathomed a boat's length from the &s;hip. But this di&s;covery was by Drake wi&s;ely concealed from the common &s;ailors, le&s;t they &s;hould abandon them&s;elves to de&s;pair, for which there was, in|deed, much cau&s;e, there being no pro&s;pect left,
<PB N="134" REF="206">
but that they mu&s;t there &s;ink along with the &s;hip.</P>
<P>In this deplorable &s;ituation they had re|mained for four and twenty hours, when Drake, finding all human efforts vain, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his companions in di&s;tre&s;s, and ex|horted them to lay a&s;ide all animo&s;ities, and prepare them&s;elves, by forgiving each other, for obtaining that mercy through Chri&s;t, which they could not hope to receive on any other terms. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On this occa&s;ion," &s;ays my author, "every thief reconciled him&s;elf to his fellow-thief, and Fletcher admini&s;tered the &s;acra|ment to them all."</Q> At length, when their hopes had for&s;aken them, and no new &s;truggles could be made, they were, on a &s;udden, re|lieved by the wind's &s;hifting, and a fre&s;h breeze &s;pringing up, which taking the &s;hip on the lee|ward quarter, &s;he reeled off the rock, without receiving any very dangerous hurt, to the un|&s;peakable joy of every &s;oul on board.</P>
<P>This was the greate&s;t and mo&s;t inextricable di&s;tre&s;s which they had &s;uffered, and made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon their minds, that for &s;ome time afterwards they dur&s;t not adventure to &s;pread their &s;ails, but went &s;lowly forward with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection, till, arriving at the fruitful i&s;land of Baretene, they entered the port to repair what damage the &s;hip had re|ceived upon the rock. They found the people of this i&s;land of an amiable and obliging di&s;po|&s;ition, courteous in their manners, and hone&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="207">
in their dealings. They are finely proportioned, tall of &s;tature, and of comely features, The men, in general, go naked; but the women cover them&s;elves from the wai&s;t downwards, are mode&s;t, yet not in&s;en&s;ible of love and plea|&s;ure. They found the i&s;land abounding with every nece&s;&s;ary, and not a few of the comforts of life.</P>
<P>Having repaired the &s;hip and refre&s;hed the men, they continued their cour&s;e without any material occurrence till the 11th of March, when they came to anchor before the i&s;land of Java, and &s;ending to the King a pre&s;ent of cloth and &s;ilks, received from him in return a pre&s;ent &s;upply of refre&s;hments; and on the day following Drake went him&s;elf on &s;hore, and entertained the King with mu&s;ic, and obtained leave to &s;tore his &s;hip with provi&s;ions. This i&s;land was governed by a great number of petty Kings or Rayas, &s;ubordinate to one Chief. Of the&s;e princes three came on board together a few days after their arrival, and having, upon their return, recounted the wonders they had &s;een, and the civilities with which they had been treated, incited others to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity in the &s;ame manner; and Raya Denan, the chief King, came him&s;elf to view the &s;hip, with the warlike armaments and in&s;truments of na|vigation. This intercour&s;e of civilities &s;ome|what retarded the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they came; but, at length, they not only victualled their &s;hip, but payed the bottom, which was the
<PB N="136" REF="208">
more nece&s;&s;ary frequently to be repeated, as, at that time, &s;heathing of &s;hips was not in prac|tice.</P>
<P>The Javans were at this time a warlike peo|ple, well armed, with &s;words, targets, and dag|gers, forged by them&s;elves, and exqui&s;itely wrought. They were &s;ociable, full of vivacity, and beyond de&s;cription happy. They were likewi&s;e ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, and not at all addicted to thievery, the general characteri&s;tic of the i&s;landers in the Pacific Sea.</P>
<P>From Java Drake intended to have vi&s;ited the Malaccas, but his company became trouble|&s;ome, being de&s;irous of returning home. On this occa&s;ion he called to mind the &s;peech of Ma&s;ter Fletcher, while they remained hopele&s;s upon the rock, and, under pretence of his &s;pi|riting up the people to oppo&s;e him, he cau&s;ed him, &s;ays my author, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be made fa&s;t by one of his legs with a chain, and a &s;taple knocked fa&s;t into the hatches, in the fore|ca&s;tle of the &s;hip. He called all the com|pany together, and then put a lock about one of his legs; and Drake, &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a che&s;t, and a pair of pantofles in his hand, he &s;aid, Francis Fletcher, I do here excommunicate thee out of the Church of God, and from all the benefits and graces thereof, and I renounce thee to the devil and all his angels; and then he charged him, upon pain of death, not once to come before the mu&s;t; for, if he did, he &s;wore he &s;hould
<PB N="137" REF="209">
be hanged, and Drake cau&s;ed a po&s;ey to be written, and bound about Fletcher's arm, with charge, that if he took it off he &s;hould then be hanged; the po&s;ey was, FRANCIS FLETCHER, THE FALSEST KNAVE THAT LIV|ETH."</Q> It does not, however, appear how long he was obliged to wear this po&s;ey, as it is called. But Drake was obliged to alter his re|&s;olution, and comply with the company's de&s;ires.</P>
<P>On the 25th of March, 1580, he, therefore, took his departure, and, on the 15th of June, they doubled the Cape of Good Hope, having then on board his &s;hip fifty-&s;even men, and but three ca&s;ks of water.</P>
<P>On the 12th of July they pa&s;&s;ed the Line, reached the coa&s;t of Guinea on the 16th, and on July the 22d arrived at Sierra Leona, after a mo&s;t delightful pa&s;&s;age, in which they di&s;co|vered how much the Portugu&s;e had abu&s;ed the world in their fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the horrors and dangers that attended the naviga|tion round the Cape. At Sierra Leona they &s;taid two days to refre&s;h the men, and, having furni&s;hed them&s;elves with wood and water for the remainder of the voyage, they &s;et &s;ail for England in high expectation of enjoying in their own country the &s;poils they had taken from the Spaniards.</P>
<P>On the 11th of September they made the i&s;land of Ferara, and, on the third of Novem|ber, they entered the harbour of Plymouth. in this voyage Drake &s;urrounded the world,
<PB N="138" REF="210">
which no Commander in Chief had ever done before; and what, at that time appeared a thing extraordinary, by &s;teering a we&s;tern cour&s;e they had lo&s;t a day in their account.</P>
<P>Their &s;ucce&s;s in this voyage, and the immen&s;e wealth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lopez Vaz, a Spani&s;h writer, &s;ays, that Drake carried from the coa&s;t of Peru, 866,000 pezoes of &s;ilver, equal to 866 quintals, equal to 100 pound weight each quintal, amounting to 1,139,200 ducats. He al&s;o carried away 100,000 pezoes of gold, equal to 10 quintals, each quintal value: at 1500 Spani&s;h ducats; and all this over and above the trea&s;ure in the &s;hip, which was not entered, con&s;i&s;ting of gold, &s;ilver, pearls, precious &s;tones, coined money, and other things of great value. He al&s;o rifled the &s;hips from the Philippines, laden with &s;pices, &s;ilks, velvets, and other rich merchandize, the value not known.&mdash;By the above account, the &s;ilver only, at 5 s. per oz. amounts to 259,800l. and the gold to 48,000l. &s;terl. But we have &s;een a manu&s;cript that makes the value of the whole cargo brought home by the Golden Hnrd (for that was the name that Drake cho&s;e his &s;hip, the Pelican, &s;hould be known by) amount to 800,000l. though that which was divided among the crew was only 80,000l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> rea&s;onable then to conclude, that the Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the remainder?</NOTE> they brought home, rai&s;ed much di&s;|cour&s;e throughout the kingdom; &s;ome highly commending, and &s;ome as loudly decrying the principles upon which it was acquired. The former alledged, that this enterprize was not only honourable to the Commander who con|ducted, and the crew who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the per|formance of it, but to their country; that it would e&s;tabli&s;h our reputation for maritime &s;kill in fo|reign nations, and rai&s;e a laudable &s;pirit of emu|lation at home; and that, as to the money, our merchants having &s;uffered deeply by the treachery
<PB N="139" REF="211">
and villainy of the Spaniards in the new di&s;co|vered country, there was nothing more ju&s;t than that the nation &s;hould receive an equivalent by the repri&s;als which Drake and his company, at the hazard of their lives, had bravely extorted.</P>
<P>The other party argued, that Drake, in fact, was no better than a pirate; that, of all others, it lea&s;t became a trading nation to countenance &s;uch depredations; that the expedition was not only a breach of all our treaties with Spain, but likewi&s;e of our old leagues with the Hou&s;e of Burgundy; and that the con&s;equences would infallibly involve the Queen in a war, by which the nation would &s;uffer infinitely more than the riches acquired by a &s;ingle &s;hip could counter-balance.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the &s;entiments, and the&s;e the &s;pe|culations with which the different parties amu&s;ed them&s;elves for &s;ome time after the arrival of Drake in his native country. At length, the appro|bation of the Queen determined the di&s;pute; for all acquie&s;ced in the wi&s;dom of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>On the 4th of April, 1581, her Maje&s;ty went to Deptford, and dined on board the &s;hip in which &s;o many Kings had been entertained be|fore; and, after dinner, &s;he conferred the ho|nour of knighthood on her Commander; an ho|nour not to be obtained in tho&s;e days on trivial occa&s;ions, but as a reward for &s;ignal &s;ervices. This mark of di&s;tinction was a full declaration of her Maje&s;ty's approbation, &s;ilenced Drake's ene|mies, and gave joy to his friends. She likewi&s;e gave
<PB N="140" REF="212">
directions for the pre&s;ervation of the &s;hip, that it might remain a monument of his own and his country's glory.</P>
<P>What contributed the more to render the fame of Drake illu&s;trious, was the frequent attempts that had been made by naviga|tors, the mo&s;t renowned in their time, to at|chieve the &s;ame; but without &s;ucce&s;s. In 1527 the Spaniards &s;ent Gracca de Loai&s;a, a Knight of Malta, with a &s;quadron of &s;even &s;hips to fol|low the rout of Magellan, who, though his &s;hip returned to Spain, yet he him&s;elf lo&s;t his life, before he arrived at the Malaccas, the promi&s;ed i&s;lands. Loai&s;a pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits, indeed, lo&s;t &s;ome of his &s;hips in the South Seas, others put into the ports of New Spain, and only his own ve&s;&s;el and one more reached the Ea&s;t Indies, where him&s;elf and all his people peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>In 1526, the Genoe&s;e &s;ent two &s;hips to pa&s;s the &s;traits, of which one was ca&s;t away, and the other returned home without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>Seba&s;tian Cabot, in the &s;ervice of the crown of Portugal, made the like trial; but, not being able to find the &s;traits, returned into the river of Plate.</P>
<P>Americus Ve&s;pu&s;ius, a Florentine, from whom the new world received its name, undertook to perform, in the &s;ervice of the crown of Portu|gal, what Cabot had promi&s;ed without effect; but that vain man was &s;till more unfortunate; for he could neither find the &s;traits, nor the river of Plate.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="213">Some years after this, the Spaniards equipped a &s;tout &s;quadron, under the command of Simon de Alca&s;ara; but, before they reached the height of the &s;traits, the crews mutinied, and obliged their Commander to return.</P>
<P>Such repeated mi&s;carriages, di&s;couraged even the able&s;t and bolde&s;t &s;eamen; &s;o that from this time both Spaniards and others dropped all thoughts of emulating Magellan, till Drake conceiving his de&s;igns, as has already been &s;aid, concealed it in his brea&s;t till ripe for execution.</P>
<P>Being now advanced to eminence, in 1585 he was employed in the Queen's &s;ervice, and &s;ent on an expedition to the We&s;t Indies as Com|mander in Chief; and having under him Cap|tain Martin Forbi&s;her, Captain Knollys, and other experienced Officers of the royal navy, he took St. Jago, St. Domingo, Carthagena, and St. Augu&s;tin. He returned elated with his &s;uc|ce&s;s; but, as my author &s;ays, not much enrich|ed by the plunder.</P>
<P>In 1587, he was again employed in an expe|dition to Li&s;bon, in which Captain Forbi&s;her al&s;o bore a part. Here they gained intelligence that a con&s;iderable fleet was a&s;&s;embled in the bay of Cadiz, with a view to the forming an ar|mament for the inva&s;ion of England; he imme|diately repaired to their place of rendezvouz, and fell upon them at unawares; and, as it is &s;aid, burnt 10,000 tons of &s;hipping, with all the &s;tores which they were ama&s;&s;ing for the in|tended inva&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="214">In their return they fell in with a carrack from the Ea&s;t Indies, richly laden, of which they likewi&s;e got intelligence in the port of Li&s;|bon. This was the St. Philip, of which Lin|&s;choten gives the following account, when this Dutchman was at Goa, the chief &s;ettlement of the Portugue&s;e in the Ea&s;t Indies: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There came in, he &s;ays, from the i&s;land of Japan certain Je&s;uits, and with them three Princes, being the children of &s;o many Kings of that country, wholly apparelled like Je&s;uits, not one of them above the age of 15 years, being minded by the per&s;ua&s;ion of the Je&s;uits to vi&s;it Portingall, and from thence to go to Rome to &s;ee the Pope, thereby to procure great profit, privileges, and liberties for the mi&s;&s;ionaries in that i&s;land.<P>"In 1584, they &s;et &s;ail for Portingallo, and from thence travelled into Spain, where, by the King and all the Spani&s;h nobility, they were with honour received, and pre&s;ented with many gifts, which the Je&s;uits kept for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"Out of Spain, they rode to &s;ee the Pope; that done, they travelled throughout Italy, where they were much honoured, and pre|&s;ented with many rich pre&s;ents, by means of the great report the Je&s;uits made of them.</P><P>"To conclude, they returned to Madrid, where with great honour they took their leave of the King, who furni&s;hed them with letters of recommendation to the Viceroy, and all

the Portingall Governors of India; &s;o they went to Li&s;bon, and there took &s;hipping in 1586, and came to Goa in the &s;hip called St. Philip, which &s;hip, in her return to Por|tingall, was taken by Captain Drake, being the fir&s;t that was taken coming from the Ea&s;t Indies; which the Portugueze took for an evil &s;ign, becau&s;e the &s;hip bore the King's own name;" both Spain and Portugal being at that time governed by the &s;ame &s;overeign.</P><P>"When the Princes and Je&s;uits of Japan ar|rived at Goa on their return from Europe, they were received, adds Lin&s;choten, with great rejoicings; for it was verily thought they had all been dead. On their landing they were all three apparelled in cloth of gold and &s;ilver after the Italian manner, being the &s;ame the Italian noblemen and gentlemen had given them. They came to Goa very lively and in high &s;pirits; and the Je&s;uits were not a little proud, that through their means the voyage had heen &s;ucce&s;sfully performed. In Goa they &s;taid till the mon&s;oon or time of the winds &s;etting in to &s;ail for China, and thence to Japan, where, with great triumph and wondering of all the people, they were re|ceived and welcomed home, to the great fur|therance of the Je&s;uits."</P></Q></P>
<P>The St. Philip, in her voyage to Goa, had been driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into Ma&s;ambique, where &s;he met with the St. Laurence, homeward bound, that had likewi&s;e been driven into the
<PB N="144" REF="216">
&s;ame port di&s;abled, having lo&s;t her ma&s;ts, and received other con&s;iderable damage, by which &s;he was rendered un&s;erviceable. The St. Philip, therefore, as &s;oon as &s;he had landed her pa&s;&s;en|gers at Goa, returned to Ma&s;ambique, and took in the lading of the St. Laurence, which enabled her to make her voyage to Europe about the u&s;ual time; a circum&s;tance fortunate for Drake, as it increa&s;ed both his fame and his fortune.</P>
<P>In 1588, Drake was appointed Vice-Admiral under Charles Lord Effingham Howard, High-Admiral of England, to oppo&s;e the formidable armada that had for three years before been &s;e|cretly preparing in Spain for the inva&s;ion of England. In Drake's letter to Lord Trea&s;urer Burleigh, acquainting him with the approach of the Spaniards, he concludes with this elegant compliment to his &s;uperior: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That, though the &s;trength of the enemy out went report, yet the chearfulne&s;s and courage which the Lord Admiral expre&s;&s;ed, gave all who had the ho|nour to &s;erve under him a&s;&s;urance of victory;"</Q> a compliment which was the more admired in Drake, as in a former letter to the &s;ame Mini&s;ter, in which he tells him of his gallant atchievement in the port of Cadiz, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not re&s;ting, &s;aid he, at Li&s;bon, we &s;ailed &s;o clo&s;e to the Spani&s;h King, <HI>that we &s;igned his beard</HI>;"</Q> a coar&s;e metaphor, it mu&s;t be owned, but &s;trongly characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>Drake's good fortune &s;till accompanied him; for in the engagement which afterwards happen|ed on the arrival of the armada, though he com|mitted
<PB N="145" REF="217">
the greate&s;t error that ever Commander was guilty of, by pur&s;uing &s;ome hulks belong|ing to the Hans Towns for plunder, when he was entru&s;ted to carry lights in the night for the direction of the Engli&s;h fleet, he mi&s;led the Admiral; yet he was the only Commander who profited mo&s;t by the de&s;truction of the enemy. Lord Howard, &s;uppo&s;ing the lights of the Spa|ni&s;h Admiral to be the lights which Drake was ordered to carry, was entangled in the very centre of the Spani&s;h fleet, before he found his mi&s;take; but, fortunately, night favouring his e&s;cape, he di&s;engaged him&s;elf before he was di&s;covered. This blunder was afterwards effa|ced by the gallant behaviour of Drake, than whom no man was ever bolder, or more deter|mined. We do not, however, find his name among the Commanders whom the Lord High Admiral thought proper to thank for their &s;er|vices on that occa&s;ion. On the 2d of July, &s;ays Strype, Sir Francis, ob&s;erving a large Spani&s;h galleon, commanded by Don Pedro de Valdez, who was the reputed projector of the inva&s;ion, floating at a di&s;tance from both fleets, &s;ent his pinnace to &s;ummon the Captain to &s;urrender, who at fir&s;t vauntingly &s;et him at defiance; but being told it was Drake that required him to yield, he immediately &s;truck his colours, and, with 46 of his crew, came on board the con|queror. In this &s;hip he found 50,000 ducats, with other effects to a much greater amount.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="218">The next year he was appointed Admiral of a &s;quadron &s;ent to place Don Antonio on the throne of Portugual, to which that Prince pretended to have a right. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, &s;ays Rapin, (who&s;e account of this expedition we &s;hall follow) as the Queen was extremely frugal, and an undertaking again&s;t Spain could not but be very expen&s;ive, &s;he &s;o ordered it, that Drake and Norris took upon them to be at the charge, in hopes of making them&s;elves amends by the booty they &s;hould meet with. So &s;he only found them &s;ix &s;hips of war, with a pre&s;ent of 60,000l. with leave to rai&s;e &s;oldiers and &s;ailors for the expedition. Drake had already tried the Spaniards in America and in the channel, and was convinced they were more formidable in common opinion than in reality; wherefore, joining with Sir John Norris, and &s;ome other private per&s;ons, they equipped a fleet, and embarked 11,000 &s;oldiers and 1500 ma|rines. The Hollanders having al&s;o added &s;ome &s;hips, the fleet con&s;i&s;ted, according to Stow, of 146 &s;ail, tran&s;ports and victuallers included. Drake commanded at &s;ea, and Norris was General of the land forces. They took with them Don Antonio, who hoped by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom, where he pretended to have many friends.<P>"They &s;ailed from Plymouth on the 18th of April, and &s;oon after arrived at the Groyne, where landing their troops, they a&s;&s;aulted the
<PB N="147" REF="219">
lower town, and carried it by &s;torm. Then they be&s;ieged the upper town. But Norris, having advice that the Conde di Andrada was approaching with a body of troops to relieve the place, &s;uddenly rai&s;ed the &s;iege to march again&s;t him; and, overtaking him, &s;lew 3000 of his men. This done, he burnt &s;everal villages; and, without returning to the &s;iege, re-embarked his troops, their principal de|&s;ign being again&s;t Portugal.</P>
<P>"Whil&s;t they were &s;ailing towards the coa&s;ts of that kingdom, they were joined by the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, with &s;ome &s;hips he had armed at his own charge, unknown to the Queen. Some days after, they arrived at Panicha, a little town in Portugal, and, taking it, re&s;tored it to Don Antonio; from thence Norris march|ed by land to Li&s;bon, Drake promi&s;ing to follow with the fleet up the Yagus. The army marched 40 miles without oppo&s;ition; and encamping before Li&s;bon, took the &s;ub|urbs of St. Catharine: but, as Drake perform|ed not his promi&s;e, and the army wanted can|non and ammunition, it was re&s;olved in a council of war to retire. This re&s;olution was taken, becau&s;e there was no appearance that the Portugue&s;e were inclined to revolt, as Don Antonio had expected; and al&s;o, be|cau&s;e there was no news of the &s;uccours he had boa&s;ted of from the King of Morocco. The army marching towards the mouth of the Tagus, met Drake, who had taken the town
<PB N="148" REF="220">
of Ca&s;caes, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf upon the impo&s;&s;ibility of performing his promi&s;e, Some days after, the ca&s;tle of Ca&s;caes &s;urren|dering, it was blown up; and, to make them&s;elves amends for the charges of the ex|pedition, the Engli&s;h &s;eized &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els laden with corn, and all manner of naval &s;tores to equip a new fleet again&s;t England, belonging to the Hans Towns. Then they went and took Vigo, which was abandoned by the in|habitants; and, firing the town, returned to England. This expedition did &s;ome damage to the King of Spain, but was of no benefit to Elizabeth; and the booty was not &s;uffi|cient to pay for equipping the fleet, though Camden &s;ays, they brought home 150 pieces of heavy cannon, and a great booty. Above &s;ix thou&s;and men peri&s;hed in this expedition by &s;ickne&s;s."</P></Q></P>
<P>The writers of Drake's life &s;ay, that Norris grievou&s;ly reproached Drake with breach of his promi&s;e, and charged the mi&s;carriage of the ex|pedition to his timidity. Indeed, Drake's good genius &s;eems now to have for&s;aken him; and hap|py, &s;ay the &s;ame writers, if, having received this fir&s;t check at play, he had withdrawn his &s;take.</P>
<P>As the war with Spain continued, Hawkins and Drake, who, as it &s;hould &s;eem, wanted to continue their old game, where the profits were more, and the danger le&s;s, united their intere&s;t to per&s;uade the Queen and Council to undertake an effectual expedition to the We&s;t Indies, by
<PB N="149" REF="221">
which the nation might be enriched, and the enemy deprived of tho&s;e re&s;ources by which they were enabled to carry on the war.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e they procured, according to Rapin, twenty-&s;ix of the queen's &s;hips, the equipment of which, like the former, &s;eems to have been &s;upplied by private adventure; a prac|tice at that time very common, where plunder was to be the reward. The preparations for this expedition, however, as it far exceeded all former enterprizes to the American Indies, could not be made &s;o privately, or conducted &s;o &s;e|cretly, but that the Spaniards found means to di&s;cover both its &s;trength and de&s;tination, and prepared them&s;elves accordingly.</P>
<P>As the places that were to be attacked lay at a great di&s;tance, it was nece&s;&s;ary to gain time, in order to fortify them. It was, therefore, found nece&s;&s;ary to devi&s;e &s;ome expedient to prevent the &s;ailing of that formidable armament, till every thing was in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e it. Ac|cordingly, it was given out, that a &s;econd inva|&s;ion was intended again&s;t England; and when the Spani&s;h fleet was ready to &s;ail for America, that had been equipping under pretence of an inva&s;ion, a &s;ham attack was made upon Corn|wall, in order to &s;pread an alarm, and give it countenance.</P>
<P>This had the de&s;ired effect. It was thought improper to part with &s;o many &s;tout &s;hips while the nation was threatened; and the expedition was therefore retarded, till the panic had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="222">It was therefore the 28th of Augu&s;t, in 1595, before the Commanders obtained permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ail; and in the mean time the Queen having received advice that the plate fleet was &s;afe ar|rived in Eorope, and that only one &s;hip, which had &s;prung her ma&s;t, remained behind, her Ma|je&s;ty acquainted them with the intelligence, and advi&s;ed them to attack Porto Rico, before they pur&s;ued their grand enterprize, by which they might make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the gal|leon without lo&s;ing much time in the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Drake, who was not formed to act in conjunct expeditions, had not been long at &s;ea before he differed in opinion from his fel|low Commander, and pur&s;ued a project totally different from the fir&s;t object of the voyage, in which, however, he was &s;econded by Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville, Commander of the land forces. This &s;cheme was to attack the Canaries in the way to America; in which, however, they failed; and &s;pending nece&s;&s;arily much time in the i&s;land of Dominica in landing and refre&s;hing the men, who, being unu&s;ed to long voyages in hot climates, were many of them unfit to proceed, the Spaniards had &s;o effectually pre|pared them&s;elves, that, when the Generals came to action, they found an oppo&s;ition very dif|ferent from what they expected; and were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that what they had formerly effected by &s;urprize with a handful of &s;ailors, was not now to be accompli&s;hed with a whole army of di&s;ciplined troops.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="223">In their cour&s;e to Porto Rico, one of the &s;ternmo&s;t &s;hips of the Engli&s;h fleet fell into the hands of five Spani&s;h frigates that had been &s;ent from Spain to convoy home the galleon from that port. From this &s;hip they gained the intelligence of the intended attack, the con|&s;equences of which being fore&s;een by Sir John Hawkins, it threw him into a &s;udden di&s;order, of which in a few days he died&mdash;&s;ome &s;ay, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>They were now, Nov. 12, 1595, before Porto, Rico, and the &s;ame Evening that Sir John Hawkins died, as the principal officers were at &s;upper, a cannon-&s;hot from the port pierced the cabin, killed Sir Nicholas Clifford, wounded Captain Stratford, mortally wounded Sir Brute Browne, and &s;truck the &s;tool from under Sir Francis Drake, as he was drinking &s;ucce&s;s to the attack.</P>
<P>The next day, pur&s;uant to a re&s;olution of a council of war, a general attack was made upon the &s;hipping in the harbour, but without effect. The Spaniards &s;uffered much, but the Engli&s;h more; who, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the fortifications of the town, weighed anchor, and &s;teered to Rio de la Hacha, &s;et fire to the town and burned it to the ground: they likewi&s;e performed &s;ome other exploits of the like kind; but having landed the troops de&s;tined to cro&s;s the i&s;thmus to attack Panama, after a fatiguing march in which they were great &s;ufferers, they returned, without being able to
<PB N="152" REF="224">
reach the place. This di&s;appointment materi|ally affected Drake, who having, as he thought, provided a &s;ufficient force to carry into execu|tion the enterprize which he had well-nigh ef|fected with a few &s;ailors and Symerons &s;ome years before, could not bear the thought of &s;ur|viving his di&s;grace. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, &s;ays Fuller, began the di&s;content of Sir Francis Drake to feed upon him. He conceived, that expectation, a mercile&s;s u&s;urer, computing each day &s;ince his departure, exacted an intere&s;t and return of honour and profit proportionable to his great preparations, and tran&s;cending his for|mer atchievements. He &s;aw that all the good which he had done in his voyage, con&s;i&s;ted in the evil he had done the Spaniards afar off, whereof he could pre&s;ent but &s;mall vi&s;ible fruits in England. The&s;e apprehen&s;ions, ac|companying, if not cau&s;ing, the di&s;ea&s;e of the flux, wrought his &s;udden death; and &s;ick|ne&s;s did not &s;o much untie his cloaths, as &s;orrow did rend at once the robe of his mor|tality a&s;under. He lived by the &s;ea, died on it, and was buried in it."</Q></P>
<P>This account of the manner of Sir Francis Drake's death &s;eems to be authentic, though &s;ome have not &s;crupled to in&s;inuate, that &s;ick|ne&s;s had no part in that cata&s;trophe. Be that as it may, Fuller's reflections upon it de&s;erve to be remembered. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus, &s;ays he, we &s;ee how great &s;pirits, having mounted to the highe&s;t pitch of performance, afterwards &s;train and
<PB N="153" REF="225">
break their credit in &s;triving to go beyond it. Or, it may be, God oftentimes leaves the brighte&s;t men in an eclip&s;e, to &s;hew that they do but borrow their lu&s;tre from his reflection."</Q></P>
<P>Thus we have endeavoured to trace the ac|tions of this celebrated navigator from begin|ning to end. If we have withdrawn the veil, which has hitherto covered his infirmities, it has been in the pur&s;uit of truth; not with a de&s;ign to detract from his real merit, but to &s;hew his character in the true light. In the current of &s;ucce&s;s, crimes of the deepe&s;t die are &s;ometimes even patronized by the public. The actions which gave ri&s;e to Drake's popularity, are &s;uch as a courageous leader, with an hundred armed followers, might in the&s;e peaceable times ea&s;ily perform, by entering the cities or towns on the coa&s;t of Britain, in the dead of night, cutting the throats of the watch, and all who happen to be awake in the &s;treets, breaking open and plundering hou&s;es, and churches, &s;eizing every thing valuable that &s;hould fall into their hands, and before the people could recover from their con&s;ternation, making their e&s;cape with their booty. Were &s;uch a company ma&s;ters of an armed ve&s;&s;el, if there were no &s;hip of force to oppo&s;e them, what &s;hould hinder their &s;ailing from place to place, and, <HI>provided they could out-run report,</HI> performing the like exploits in every town they came to? Would there be any|thing truly great in this? Or would the man
<PB N="154" REF="226">
who &s;hould undertake and execute an enter|prize of &s;uch a horrid nature, be ju&s;tly entitled to the name of Hero? If not, what &s;hall we &s;ay of Drake's nocturnal enterprize on Nombre de Dios; of his way-laying the trea&s;ure in the road from Panama; of his ranging the unarm|ed coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru; and of his plun|dering villages, towns, and &s;hips belonging to a peaceable un&s;u&s;pecting people, with whom his nation was at peace, and from whom oppo&s;ition was not to be dreaded? What, indeed, did the people at that time &s;ay? Tho&s;e who were the &s;ufferers cried out loudly again&s;t the plun|derer; and Bernardine de Mendoza, the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Queen Elizabeth, in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed for his rob|beries, and that all the money and effects he had &s;eized &s;hould be re&s;tored; but, if the Queen was a private adventurer, as, from Drake's de|claration to his followers, and from other in|&s;tances of the womani&s;h littlene&s;&s;es of that Prince&s;s, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, What hope was there of ju&s;tice or re&s;titution from remon|&s;trance? Indeed, it &s;erved that avaricious Queen for a pretence to &s;eque&s;ter the trea&s;ure which Drake brought home, and to convert, it is pro|bable, the greate&s;t part of it to her own u&s;e; for, as we have already &s;hewn from good autho|rity in a note, though the whole booty was va|lued at 800,000 l. yet only 80,000 l. was divided among the plunderers; and Rapin tells us, that &s;ome part of the trea&s;ure was afterwards repaid
<PB N="155" REF="227">
by the Queen to Spain. If &s;he had not retained enough in her hands, no one will &s;uppo&s;e, that the Sovereign, who could cau&s;e the goods of her favourite Leice&s;ter to be &s;et to public &s;ale after his death, for the payment of money &s;he had lent him, would have repaid to Spain from her own coffers the plunder that had been unju&s;tly taken by one of her meaner &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To dignify actions, therefore, of the mo&s;t in|famous piracy with the name of great, is to ex|alt vice, and to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ucce&s;sful villainy in the place of &s;ub&s;tantial virtue. If we view Drake in the light of a courageous plunderer, he may vie with the De la Poles, the Blackbeards, or any of tho&s;e daring di&s;turbers of the times in which they lived, who &s;truck a panic wherever they roved to commit their ravages: but, con|&s;ider him as a Commander, employed in the de|fence of his country, and we &s;hall &s;ee nothing to admire, except his courage. In the fir&s;t en|terprize in which he was engaged, he was indeed &s;ucce&s;sful. The Queen, &s;u&s;pecting an intention in Philip of Spain to revenge the injuries his &s;ubjects had received, pitched upon Drake, who had given the offence, as the fitte&s;t man to pre|vent the con&s;equences. He, therefore, as he had done before, attacked the enemy by &s;ur|prize, and &s;et fire to a defencele&s;s number of tran&s;ports a&s;&s;embled in the harbour of Cadiz, without a &s;hip of war to protect them, or a gun fired by way of oppo&s;ition. The accident which afterwards threw the rich India &s;hip in his way,
<PB N="156" REF="228">
on his return home, did him no honour as a Commander, though it gave him credit as a for|tunate adventurer: nor did his behaviour in the Channel, when, in&s;tead of maintaining his po&s;t, he pur&s;ued the Hans merchant &s;hips, add at all to his reputation as a Vice-Admiral. His Ame|rican enterprize with Lord Carli&s;le was attended with no laurels; and the only two enterprizes in which he was employed in a joint command, he ruined by his perfidy and &s;elf-conceit.</P>
<P>It may, indeed, be urged in Drake's defence, that it was the policy of the Queen, his Sove|reign, to countenance her &s;ubjects in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Spain, and in mortifying the haughty monarch who &s;at upon the throne; and that almo&s;t all the heroes of her active reign, acquired their glory by practices founded on the &s;ame prevail|ing principle.</P>
<P>This argument in his favour cannot be denied its due weight. The expeditions of Sir John Hawkins; of Sir Walter Raleigh; of Lord Carli&s;le; of Sir John Norris; of the earl of E&s;|&s;ex; of Cavendi&s;h; and, indeed, of mo&s;t others undertaken again&s;t Spain; were profe&s;&s;edly with a view to plunder; and the charges of fit|ting them out were chiefly borne by tho&s;e who were to be &s;harers in the booty: yet, &s;urely, there is a material difference between the glory that is purcha&s;ed by valour in the field, and fame that is acquired by compacts to &s;urprize the innocent, and invade the property of the peaceable.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="229">Having now &s;een Drake in two di&s;tinct points of view, as a leader of a company of plunderers, and as a Commander in the royal navy, let us do ju&s;tice to his character by viewing him as a mari|ner, and in that light he will hardly have his equal. To project a voyage round the globe, and to conduct it without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ingle ma|riner on board who had ever cro&s;&s;ed the Line, Nuno da Silva, the Portugue&s;e pilot, excepted, was, perhaps, one of the bolde&s;t exploits that ever man performed. His navigating his &s;hips along the coa&s;t of Brazil; his carrying them through the &s;traits of Magellan in a &s;horter time than any mariner has ever done &s;ince; his keeping the &s;ea in a &s;torm for thirty days toge|ther in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el; his &s;kill in navigating the coa&s;ts of Chili, Peru, and New Spain, where no Engli&s;h &s;hip had ever &s;ailed; his accuracy in di&s;covering the track of the Spani&s;h &s;hip from the Ea&s;t Indies, and his con&s;ummate &s;agacity in pur&s;uing a new cour&s;e home to avoid pur&s;uers; cannot be enough admired or applauded. His knowledge of the globe is manife&s;t from the fir&s;t attempt he made to return home by a northern pa&s;&s;age; a pa&s;&s;age which he knew would not only &s;ecure him from the danger of pur&s;uers, but, were it practicable, would open a free intercour&s;e be|tween his nation and the rich inhabitants of that opulent country in which he was then &s;ituated.

<HEAD>THE VOYAGES OF CAPT. THOMAS CAVENDISH, THE SECOND ENGLISH NAVIGATOR WHO SAILED ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was de&s;cended from an antient family in Suffolk, who&s;e ance&s;tors came into England with William the Conqueror. His father, William Cavendi&s;h, of Trimley St. Martin, near Ip&s;wich, dying young, left his &s;on Thomas a minor, and heir to the manors of Trimley, Stratton, and Grim&s;ton, with other lands of inheritance to a very con&s;iderable amount: but this youth, who&s;e atchievements we are about to relate, being of a high &s;pirited di&s;po&s;ition, and, as &s;oon as he came of age, &s;ubject to no controul, fell early into the fa|&s;hionable gallantries and vices of the times, and di&s;&s;ipated the be&s;t part of his ample fortune be|fore he entertained any thoughts of applying to bu&s;ine&s;s, or, perhaps, was &s;en&s;ible how deeply his affairs were embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But he no &s;ooner began to reflect, and to per|ceive, that, without application to &s;ome kind of employment, he mu&s;t be undone, than he made choice of a &s;ea-faring life, not only as mo&s;t &s;uit|able to his un&s;ettled turn of mind, but al&s;o as the mo&s;t likely means of re&s;toring his fortune, and e&s;tabli&s;hing his credit.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="232">The kingdom was now involved in war with the Spaniards, the then mo&s;t powerful, and con|&s;equently the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t formidable people in Europe, who, drawing immen&s;e riches from their new acqui&s;itions in America, not only rai&s;ed the envy but the enmity of other powers, by their pride and their perfidy.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of fortune, and gentlemen of no fortune, were about this time equally encourag|ed to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy. The war laid open an immen&s;e field for enterprize; and every one was at liberty to &s;hare the harve&s;t, who was will|ing to be&s;tow the pains of gathering the produce and bringing it home.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t active and the mo&s;t indefa|tigable was Sir Walter Raleigh, who not only was the mo&s;t experienced, but the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful leader of his time. With him our adventurer fir&s;t determined to embark; and, as Sir Walter had ju&s;t projected a new Voyage to America at his own charge, he was ready enough to admit a&s;&s;ociates, who were able and willing to bear a part of the expence. Unfortunately for our new adventurer, all the advantage he derived from this project was only in the knowledge he obtained of &s;ea affairs, and of the temper and genius of the people with whom he had to deal; for the profits that accrued from the voyage by no means an&s;wered the &s;ums employed in pur|&s;uing it. He ob&s;erved, that, by means of their great riches, the Spaniards could command in|telligence of all that was in agitation again&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="233">
them on this &s;ide the globe; but that, if they were to be taken off their guard, the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere mu&s;t be the place of action. He had already an example, in Sir Francis Drake, of the immen&s;e wealth that was to be acquired on the coa&s;t of Peru, if &s;ecrecy could be pre|&s;erved, and he determined to be upon his guard, and to keep his de&s;ign &s;olely within his own brea&s;t.</P>
<P>With this view he &s;old a part of the remains of his e&s;tate, and &s;et about building two &s;hips proper for his enterprize at Harwich, at that time an ob&s;cure port, namely, one called the <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> of 120 tons; and another of 60, called the <HI>Content</HI>; to the&s;e he added the <HI>Hugh Gallant,</HI> a bark of 40 tons. In the equipment of this little &s;quadron, he purcha&s;ed many articles of commerce to cover his de&s;ign, and then privately laid in guns, ammunition and &s;tores, with a moderate quantity of provi&s;ions, intending to purcha&s;e the re&s;t at &s;ome other convenient port, when he was ju&s;t ready to depart.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e enli&s;ted but half his complement of men; and when he arrived at Plymouth he &s;upplied the re&s;t. In the whole conduct of what has been already related, he was his own &s;ole director, and none of tho&s;e who &s;ailed with him knew whither he was bound, till after their embarkation at Plymouth. It is even uncertain whether Lord Houn&s;don, who procured his commi&s;&s;ion, knew the place of his de&s;tina|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="234">An enterprize &s;o well concerted cannot fail to excite curio&s;ity; and as it was excellently written by Mr. Pretty, brother to Sir William, who accompanied Cavendi&s;h throughout the voyage, it will be&s;t appear in its ancient dre&s;s.</P>
<P>"We departed, &s;ays Mr. Pretty, out of Plymouth on Thur&s;day the 21&s;t of July, 1586, with three &s;ails (to wit, the De&s;ire, a &s;hip of 120 tons, the Content of 60 tons, and the Hugh Gallant, a bark of 40 tons); in which &s;mall fleet were 123 per&s;ons of all &s;orts, with all kind of furniture, and victuals &s;ufficient for the &s;pace of two years. On Tue&s;day the 26th of the &s;ame month, we were forty-five leagues from Cape Finis Terrae, where we met with five &s;ails of Bi&s;cayers, coming from the Grand Bay in Newfoundland, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, which our Admiral &s;hot at, and fought with them three hours; but we took none of them, by rea&s;on the night grew on.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of Augu&s;t we came in &s;ight of Fort Ventura, one of the i&s;les of the Canaries, about ten o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>On Sunday, being the 7th of Augu&s;t, we were gotten as high as Rio del Oro, on the coa&s;t of Barbary.</P>
<P>On Monday the 19th, we fell in with Cape Blanco, but the wind blew &s;o much at the North, that we could not get up where the Canters do u&s;e to ride and fi&s;h; therefore we lay off &s;ix hours we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, becau&s;e of the
<PB N="163" REF="235">
&s;and which lieth off the Cape &s;outh-we&s;t and by &s;outh.</P>
<P>The 15th day of the &s;ame month we were in the height of Cape Verd, by e&s;timation fifty leagues off the &s;ame. The 18th, Sierra Leona did bear ea&s;t of us, being forty leagues from us; and the &s;ame day the wind &s;hifted to the north-we&s;t; &s;o that, by the 20th day of the &s;aid month, we were in &s;ix degrees thirty minutes to the northward of the Equinoctial Line.</P>
<P>The 23d, we &s;et &s;ail for Sierra Leona, and on the 25th day we fell in with the point on the &s;outh &s;ide of Sierra Leona, which Mr. Brewer knew very well, and went in before with the Content, which was Vice-admiral: and we had no le&s;s than five fathoms water when we had lea&s;t, and had, for fourteen leagues in &s;outh-we&s;t, all the way running into the harbour of Sierra Leona, &s;ixteen, fourteen, twelve, ten, and eight fathoms of water.</P>
<P>The 26th of the &s;aid month, we put into the harbour; and, in going in, we had by the &s;outhmo&s;t point at lea&s;t five fathoms water by the rock, which lieth at the &s;aid point: and after we came within two or three cables length of the &s;aid rock, we never had le&s;s than ten fathoms water until we came up to the road, which is about a league from the point, bor|dering always on the &s;outh-&s;ide until you come up to the watering-place, in which bay is the be&s;t road: but you mu&s;t ride far into the bay,
<PB N="164" REF="236">
becau&s;e there runs prodigious great tides in the offing, and it commonly floweth into the road at a &s;outh-ea&s;t and by ea&s;t moon.</P>
<P>It is from England to this place 930 leagues; which we ran from the 21&s;t of July to the 26th of this month of Augu&s;t. On Saturday, be|ing the 27th day, there came two negroes from the &s;hore aboard our Admiral, and made &s;igns unto our General that there was a Por|tugue&s;e &s;hip within the harbour; &s;o the Hugh Gallant, being the Rear-admiral, went up three or four leagues, but, for want of a pilot, they went no farther, for the harbour runneth up three or four leagues more, and is of a pro|digious breadth, and very dangerous, as we were afterwards informed by a Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 28th, the General &s;ent &s;ome of his company on &s;hore, and there, as they played and danced all the forenoon among the negroes, to the end that they might hear &s;ome good news of the Portugue&s;e &s;hip, and as they were returning to go on board, they &s;pied a Portugue&s;e, which lay hid among the bu&s;hes, whom we took and brought away with us the &s;ame night: and he told us it was very dan|gerous going up with our boats in &s;earch of the &s;hip that was at the town. Wherupon we went not to &s;eek her, becau&s;e we knew he told us the truth; for we bound him and made him fa&s;t, and &s;o examined him. He told us al&s;o, that his &s;hip was there ca&s;t away, and that there were two more of his company among the ne|groes.
<PB N="165" REF="237">
The Portugue&s;e's name was Emmanuel, and was by his occupation a chalker, belonging to the port of Portugal.</P>
<P>On Monday morning, being the 29th day, our General landed with 70 men, or thereabouts, and went up to their town, where we burnt two or three hou&s;es, and took what &s;poil we could, which was but little; but all the people fled: and, in our retiring on board, in a very little plain, at their town's end, they &s;hot their arrows at us out of the woods, and hurt three or four of our men. Their arrows were poi&s;oned; but yet none of our men mi&s;carried at that time. Their town is very artificially built with mud walls; their hou&s;es built round, with their yards paled in, and kept very clean, as are their &s;treets. The&s;e negroes u&s;ed great obedience to their king, as one of our men &s;aid, which was an ho&s;tage for the negroes which came fir&s;t. There were in their town, by e&s;timation, about one hundred hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of September, there went many of our men on &s;hore at the watering-place, and did wa&s;h &s;hirts very quietly all the day. And the &s;econd day they went again, and the negroes were in ambu&s;h round about the place; and the carpenter of the Admiral going into the wood, to do &s;ome &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pied them by good fortune. But the negroes ru&s;hed out upon our men &s;o &s;uddenly, that, in retiring to our boats, many of them were hurt; among whom Wm. Pickman, a &s;oldier, was &s;hot in the thigh; who, plucking the arrow out, broke it,
<PB N="166" REF="238">
and left the head behind; and he told the chi|rurgeons that he plucked out all the arrow, be|cau&s;e he would not have them lance his thigh: whereupon the poi&s;on wrought &s;o that night, that he was prodigiou&s;ly &s;wolen, and the next morn|ing he died; the piece of the arrow with the poi&s;on being afterwards plucked out of his thigh.</P>
<P>The 3d day of the &s;aid month, divers of our fleet went up four miles within the harbour with our boat, and caught great &s;tore of fi&s;h, and went on &s;hore, and took lemons from the trees; and, coming on board again, &s;aw two buffaloes.</P>
<P>The 6th day we departed from Sierra Leona, and went out of the harbour, and &s;taid one tide three leagues from the point of the mouth of the harbour, in &s;ix fathoms, and it flowed &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, being the 7th of the &s;ame month, we departed for one of the i&s;les of Cape Verd, which is ten leagues di&s;tant from the point of Sierra Leona; and about five o'clock the &s;ame night we anchored about two miles off the i&s;land, in &s;ix fathoms water, and landed the &s;ame night, and found plantains only upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The 8th day, one of our boats went out, and &s;ounded about the i&s;land, and they pa&s;&s;ed through a Sound at the we&s;t end of the i&s;land, where they found five fathoms water round about the i&s;land, until they came to the very gut of the Sound, and then for a ca&s;t or two they had but two fathoms water, and pre&s;ently after &s;ix fathoms, and &s;o deeper and deeper.
<PB N="167" REF="239">
And, at the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, there was a town where negroes re&s;orted at &s;ome times, as we perceived by their provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is no fre&s;h water on all the &s;outh-&s;ide that we could perceive; but, on the north-&s;ide, three or four very good places of fre&s;h water: and all the whole i&s;land is a wood, &s;ave certain little places where the hou&s;es &s;tand, which are environed round about with plantain trees, whereof the fruit is excellent meat. This place is &s;ubject very much to thunder, rain, and light|ning, in this month: I think the rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e the &s;un is near the Line Equinoctial. On Saturday the 10th, we departed from the &s;aid i&s;land about three o'clock in the afternoon, the wind being at the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of October, running we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, about twenty-four leagues from Cape Frio in Brazil, we fell in with a great mountain, which had an high round knob on the top of it, &s;tand|ing like a tower.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of November, we went in between the i&s;land of St. Seba&s;tian and the main land, carried &s;everal things on &s;hore, &s;et up a forge, and had our ca&s;ks on &s;hore; our cooper made hoops; and &s;o we remained there until the 23d day of the &s;ame month; in which time we fitted our things, built our pinnace, and filled our fre&s;h water. And while our pinnace was building, there came a canoe from the river of Janeiro, meaning to go to St. Vincent, wherein were &s;ix naked &s;laves of the country, which did row the canoe, and one Portugue&s;e; and the
<PB N="168" REF="240">
Portugue&s;e knew Chri&s;topher Hare, Ma&s;ter of the Admiral; for that Mr. Hare had been at St. Vincent, in the Minion of London, in the year 1581: and, thinking to have John Whithal, the Engli&s;hman, which dwelleth at St. Vincent, come unto us, which is twenty leagues from this harbour, with &s;ome others, thereby to have had &s;ome fre&s;h victuals, we &s;uffered the Portu|gue&s;e to go with a letter unto him, who promi&s;ed to return, or &s;end &s;ome an&s;wer within ten days, for that we told him we were merchants, and would traffic with them; but we never received any an&s;wer from him; and &s;eeing that he came not according to appointment, our bu&s;ine&s;s be|ing di&s;patched, we weighed anchor, and &s;et &s;ail from St. Seba&s;tian on the 23d of November.</P>
<P>The 16th day of December we fell in with the coa&s;t of America, in 47 deg. and 20 min. the land bearing we&s;t from us about &s;ix leagues off; from which place we ran along the &s;hore until we came into 48 deg. It is a &s;teep beach all along.</P>
<P>The 17th of December, in the afternoon, we entered into an harbour, where our Admiral went in fir&s;t; wherefore our General named the &s;aid harbour Port De&s;ire; in which harbour is an i&s;land or two, where there is a wonderful great &s;tore of &s;eals, and another i&s;land of birds, called grey gulls. The&s;e &s;eals are of a wonderful big|ne&s;s, huge and mon&s;trous of &s;hape; and, for the fore part of their bodies, cannot be compared to any thing better than to a lion: their head, neck,
<PB N="169" REF="241">
and fore-part of their bodies, are full of rough hair; their feet are in the manner of a fin, and in form like unto a man's hand; they breed and ca&s;t every month, giving their young milk, yet continually get they their living in the &s;ea, and live altogether upon fi&s;h: their young are extra|ordinary good meat; and being boiled or roa&s;t|ed, are hardly to be known from lamb or mut|ton. The old ones are of &s;uch bigne&s;s and force, that it is as much as four men are able to do to kill one of them with great &s;taves; and he mu&s;t be beaten down with &s;triking on the head of him; for his body is of that bigne&s;s, that four men could never kill him, but only on the head; for being &s;hot through the body with an harque|bu&s;s, or a mu&s;ket, yet he will go his way into the &s;ea, and never care for it at the pre&s;ent. Al&s;o the fowls that were there were very good meat, and great plenty of them; they have bur|rows in the ground like conies, for they cannot fly; they have nothing but down upon their pinions; they al&s;o fi&s;h and feed in the &s;ea for their living, and breed on &s;hore.</P>
<P>This harbour is a very good place to trim &s;hips in, and to bring them on ground and grave them in, for there ebbeth and floweth much wa|ter; therefore we graved and trimmed all our &s;hips there.</P>
<P>The 24th of December, being Chri&s;tmas-eve, a man and a boy of the Rear-admiral went &s;ome forty &s;cores from our &s;hips, unto a very fair green valley at the foot of a mountain,
<PB N="170" REF="242">
where was a little pit or well which our men had digged and made &s;ome two or three days before, to get fre&s;h water; for there was none in all the harbour; and this was but bracki&s;h; therefore this man and boy went thither to wa&s;h their linen; and being in wa&s;hing at the &s;aid well, there were great numbers of Indians which were come down, and found the &s;aid man and boy in wa&s;hing. The&s;e Indians being divided on each &s;ide of the rocks, &s;hot at them with their arrows, and hurt them both; but they fled pre&s;ently, being about fifty or three&s;core, though our General followed them but with &s;ixteen or twenty men. The man was &s;hot quite through the knee, the boy into the &s;houlder; either of them having very &s;ore wounds. Their arrows are made of little canes, and their heads are of a flint &s;tone, &s;et into the cane very arti|ficially. They are as wild as ever was a buck, or any other wild bea&s;t; for we followed them, and they ran from us as we had been the wilde&s;t things in the world. We took the mea&s;ure of one of their feet, and it was eighteen inches long. Their cu&s;tom is, when any of them die, to bring him or them to the cliffs by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and upon the top of them they bury them; and in their graves are buried with them their bows and arrows, and all their jewels which they had in their life-time, which are fine &s;hells that they find by the &s;ea-&s;ide, which they cut and &s;quare after an artificial manner; and all are laid under their heads. The grave is made
<PB N="171" REF="243">
with large &s;tones of great length and bigne&s;s, being &s;et all along full of the dead man's darts, which he u&s;ed when he was living. And they colour both their darts and their graves of a red colour, which they u&s;e in colouring them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The 28th of December, we departed out of the port of De&s;ire, and went to an i&s;land which lieth three leagues to the &s;outhward of it; where we trimmed our &s;aved penguins with &s;alt, for victuals, all that and the next day, and departed along the coa&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t and by-&s;outh.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t we fell in with a rock, which lieth about five leagues from the land, much like un|to Edi&s;tone, which lieth off the &s;ound of Ply|mouth; and we &s;ounded, and had eight fathoms rocky ground, within a mile thereof; the rock bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t. We went coa&s;ting a|long &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, and found great &s;tore of &s;eals. This rock &s;tandeth in 48 deg. 30 min. to the &s;outhward of the Line.</P>
<P>The 2d day of January, we fell in with a very fair white cape, which &s;tandeth in 51 degrees, and had &s;even fathoms water a league off the land.</P>
<P>The 3d, we fell in with another great white cape, which &s;tandeth in 52 deg. 45 min. from which cape there runneth a low beach about a league to the &s;outhward; and this beach reacheth to the opening of the dangerous &s;trait of Ma|gellan, which is in divers places five or &s;ix
<PB N="172" REF="244">
leagues wide, and in two &s;everal places more narrow. Under this cape we anchored, and lo&s;t an anchor; for it was a great &s;torm, and la&s;ted three days very dangerous.</P>
<P>The 6th day we put in for the &s;traits.</P>
<P>The 7th day, between the mouth of the &s;traits and the narrowe&s;t place thereof we took a Spaniard, who&s;e name was Hernando, who was there with 23 Spaniards more, which were all that remained of four hundred left there three years before, all the re&s;t being dead with fa|mine. And the &s;ame day we pa&s;&s;ed through the narrowe&s;t of the &s;traits, where the afore&s;aid Spaniard &s;hewed us the hull of a &s;mall bark, which we judged to be a bark called the John Thomas, one of Drake's fleet. It is from the mouth of the &s;traits unto the narrowe&s;t of the &s;traits fourteen leagues, and the cour&s;e lieth we&s;t and by-north. The mouth of the &s;traits lieth in 52 degrees.</P>
<P>From the narrowe&s;t of the &s;traits unto Pen|guin i&s;land is ten leagues, and lieth we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, &s;omewhat to the &s;outhward, where we anchored the 8th day, and killed and &s;alted plenty of penguins for victuals.</P>
<P>The 9th day we departed from Penguin i&s;land, and ran &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t to King Phi|lip's city, which the Spaniards had built; which town or city had four forts, and every fort had in it one ca&s;t piece, which pieces were buried in the ground; the carriages were &s;tand|ing in their places unburied; we digged for
<PB N="173" REF="245">
them and had them all. They had contrived their city very well, and &s;eated it in the be&s;t place of the &s;traits for wood and water: they had built up their churches by them&s;elves: they had laws very &s;evere among them, for they had erected a gibbet, whereon they had done exe|cution on &s;ome of their company. It &s;eemed unto us, that their whole living for a great &s;pace was altogether upon mu&s;cles and limpets; for there was not any thing el&s;e to be had, ex|cept &s;ome deer which came out of the moun|tains down to the fre&s;h rivers to drink. The&s;e Spaniards came to fortify the &s;traits, to the end that no nation &s;hould have pa&s;&s;age through into the South Sea, &s;aving their own only: but, as it appeared, it was not God's will &s;o to have it; for during the time that they were there, which was two years at the lea&s;t, they could never have any thing to grow, or in any ways pro&s;per; and, on the other &s;ide, the Indians often prey|ed upon them, until their victuals grew &s;o &s;hort, (their &s;tore being &s;pent which they had brought with them out of Spain, and having no means to renew the &s;ame) that they died like dogs in their hou&s;es, and in their clothes, wherein we found &s;ome of them &s;till at our coming, until that in the end the town being wonderfully tainted with the &s;mell and favour of the dead people, the re&s;t which remained alive were driven to bury &s;uch things as they had there in their town, and &s;o to for&s;ake the town, and to go along the &s;ea-&s;ide to &s;eek their victuals to
<PB N="174" REF="246">
pre&s;erve them from &s;tarving, taking nothing with them, but every man his harquebu&s;s, and his furniture, that was able to do it (for &s;ome of them were not able to carry them for weak|ne&s;s), and &s;o lived, for the &s;pace of a year and more, on roots, leaves, and &s;ometimes a fowl which they might kill with their piece. To con|clude, they &s;et forwards, determined to travel towards the river of Plate, there being only twenty-three per&s;ons left alive, whereof two were women, which were the remainder of four hundred. In this place we watered and wooded well and quietly. Our General named this town Port Famine: it &s;tandeth in 53 degrees by ob&s;ervation to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>The 14th day we departed from this place, and ran &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t, and from thence &s;outh-we&s;t: unto Cape Froward, five leagues we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, which cape is the &s;outhermo&s;t part of all the &s;traits, and &s;tandeth in the lati|tude of 54 degrees. From which cape we ran we&s;t and by north five leagues, and put into a bay or cove on the &s;outh-&s;ide, which we called Mu&s;cle-cove, becau&s;e there was great plenty of them: we rode therein &s;ix days, the wind being &s;till we&s;terly.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day of January we departed from Mu&s;cle-cove, and went north-we&s;t and by-we&s;t ten leagues, to a very fair &s;andy bay on the north-&s;ide, which our General called Elizabeth-bay: and, as we rode there that night, one of our men died which went in the Hugh Gallant,
<PB N="175" REF="247">
who&s;e name was Grey, a carpenter by his oc|cupation, and was buried there in that bay.</P>
<P>The 22d we departed from Elizabeth-bay in the afternoon, and went about two leagues from that place, where there was a fre&s;h water river, up which our General went with the &s;hip's boat about three miles; which river hath very good and plea&s;ant ground about it. It is low and champaign &s;oil, and we &s;aw no other ground in all the &s;traits, but what was craggy rocks, and mon&s;trous high hills and mountains. In this river are a great many &s;avages, which we &s;aw, and had conference with them. They were men-eaters, and fed altogether upon raw fle&s;h, and other filthy food: which people had lately preyed upon &s;ome of the Spaniards before &s;poken of; for they had gotten knives, and &s;ome pieces of rapiers to make darts of. They u&s;ed all the means they could po&s;&s;ibly to have enticed us farther up the river, on purpo&s;e to have betrayed us; which being perceived by our General, he cau&s;ed us to &s;hoot at them with our harquebu&s;&s;es, whereby we killed many of them. So we &s;ailed from this river, to the channel of St. Jerome, which is two leagues off.</P>
<P>From the river of St. Jerome, about three or four leagues, we ran we&s;t into a cape which is on the north-&s;ide; and from that cape unto the mouth of the &s;traits the cour&s;e lieth north-we&s;t and by-we&s;t, and north-we&s;t; between which place and the mouth of the &s;traits, to the &s;outh|ward,
<PB N="176" REF="248">
we lay in harbour until the 23d of Feb|ruary, by rea&s;on of contrary winds; and mo&s;t vile and foul weather, with &s;uch rain and violent &s;tormy winds which came down from the moun|tains and high hills, that they hazarded the be&s;t cables and anchors that we had for to hold; which, if they had failed, we had been in great danger to have been ca&s;t away, or at lea&s;t to have been fami&s;hed: for, during this time, which was a full month, we fed almo&s;t altogether on mu&s;|cles, limpets, and birds, or &s;uch as we could get on &s;hore, &s;eeking every day for them, as the fowls of the air do where they can find food in continual rainy weather.</P>
<P>There is, at every one or two miles end, an harbour on both &s;ides of the land. And there are, between the river of St. Jerome and the mouth of the &s;traits, going into the South Sea, about 34 leagues, by e&s;timation; &s;o that the whole length of the &s;traits is about 90 leagues: and the mouth of the &s;aid &s;traits &s;tandeth nearly in the &s;ame height that the entrance &s;tandeth in when we pa&s;s out of the North Sea, which is about 52 deg. and 40 min. to the &s;outhward of the Line.</P>
<P>The 24th day of February, we entered into the South Sea; and on the &s;outh &s;ide in going out of the &s;traits is a fair high cape, with a low point adjoining to it; and on the north-&s;ide are four or five i&s;lands which lie &s;ix leagues off the main, and much broken and &s;unken ground about them. By noon, the &s;ame day, we had brought
<PB N="177" REF="249">
the&s;e i&s;lands ea&s;t of us five leagues off; the wind being &s;outherly.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of March, a &s;torm took us at north, which night the &s;hips lo&s;t the company of the Hugh Gallant, being in 49 degrees 30 min. and 45 leagues from land. This &s;torm conti|nued three or four days; and for that time we in the Hugh Gallant, being &s;eparated from the other two &s;hips, looked every hour to &s;ink, our bark was &s;o leaky, and our&s;elves &s;o fatigued and weakened with freeing it of water, that we &s;lept not during three days and three nights.</P>
<P>The 15th of March, in the morning, the Hugh Gallant came in between the i&s;land of St. Mary and the Main, where &s;he met with the Admiral and the Content, who had rid at the i&s;land of La Mocha two days, which i&s;land &s;tandeth in &s;outh latitude 38 deg. at which place &s;ome of our men went on &s;hore with the Vice-Admiral's boat, where the Indians fought with them with their bows and arrows, and were very wary of their calivers. The&s;e Indians were enemies to the Spaniards, and belonged to a great place called Arauco, and took us for Spaniards, as we afterwards learned.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned place, Arauco, is very rich, and full of gold mines; and yet could it not be &s;ubdued at any time by the Spaniards; but they always returned with the greate&s;t lo&s;s of men: for the&s;e Indians are quite de&s;perate, and carele&s;s of their lives, living at their own liberty and freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="250">The 15th day afore&s;aid, in the afternoon, we weighed anchor, and ran under the we&s;t &s;ide of St. Mary's I&s;land, where we rid very well in &s;ix fathoms water, and very fair ground, all that night.</P>
<P>The 16th day, our General went on &s;hore him&s;elf, with 70 or 80 men, every one with his furniture. There came down to us certain In|dians, with two which were the Chiefs of the i&s;land, to welcome us on &s;hore, thinking we had been Spaniards, for it is &s;ubdued by them; who brought us up to a place where the Spaniards had erected a church, with cro&s;&s;es and altars in it; and there were about this church two or three &s;tore-hou&s;es, which were full of wheat and barley ready thre&s;hed, and made up in cades of &s;traw, to the quantity of a bu&s;hel of corn in every cade. The wheat and barley was as fair, as clear, and every way as good as any we have in England. There were al&s;o the like cades full of potatoe-roots, which were very good to eat, ready made up in the &s;tore-hou&s;es, for the Spa|niards when they &s;hould come for their tribute This i&s;land al&s;o yielded many &s;orts of fruits, hogs and hens. The&s;e Indians are held in &s;uch &s;lavery by their ma&s;ters, that they dare not eat a hen or hog them&s;elves: but the Spaniards have made them all in that i&s;land chri&s;tians. Thus we filled our&s;elves here with corn as much as we would have, and as many hogs as we had &s;alt to &s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> them with, and great plenty of hens, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> number of bags of potatoe-roots, and about 50<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

dried dog-fi&s;hes, and Guinea wheat, which is called maiz. And having taken as much as we would, yet we left a prodigious great &s;tore be|hind us. Our General had the two Chiefs of the i&s;land on board our &s;hip, and provided great cheer for them, and made them merry with wine: and they, in the end, perceiving that we were not Spaniards, made &s;igns, as near as our Gene|ral could perceive, that, if we would go over unto the main land to Arauco, there was much gold; making us &s;igns, that we &s;hould have great &s;tore of riches. But, becau&s;e we could not under&s;tand them, our General made ha&s;te, and within two or three days we furni&s;hed our|&s;elves, and departed.</P>
<P>The 18th day, in the morning, we departed from this place; and ran all that day north-north-ea&s;t about ten leagues, and at night lay with a &s;hort &s;ail off and on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The 19th, we ran in ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t with the land, and bore in with a place called the Con|ception, where we anchored under an i&s;land, and departed the next morning without going on land.</P>
<P>The 20th, we departed from the Conception, and went into a little bay, which was &s;andy, where we &s;aw fre&s;h water and cattle; but we &s;taid not there.</P>
<P>The 30th day, we came into the bay of Quintero, which &s;tandeth in 33 deg. and 50 min.</P>
<P>The &s;aid day, pre&s;ently after we were come to an anchor in the bay, there was a herd&s;man,
<PB N="180" REF="252">
that kept cattle, lying upon the point of the hill a&s;leep; who, when he awaked, and had e&s;pied three &s;hips which were come into the bay, be|fore we could get on &s;hore, he had mounted a hor&s;e which was feeding by, and rode his way as fa&s;t as ever he was able; and our General, with thirty &s;hot with him, went on &s;hore. He had not been on land an hour when there came three hor&s;emen with bright &s;words towards us, &s;o hard as they could ride, till within a quarter of a mile of us, and then &s;topt, and would come no nearer unto us: &s;o our General &s;ent unto them a couple of our men with their &s;hot, and Hernando, who was the Spaniard that we had taken up at the mouth of the &s;traits. But the Spaniards would not &s;uffer our men to come near with their &s;hot, but made &s;igns that one of our men &s;hould come alone unto them: &s;o the &s;aid Hernando, the Spaniard, went unto them, and our two men &s;tood not far from them. They had &s;ome conference; and, in the end, Hernando came back from them, and told our General that he had parlied with them for &s;ome victuals, and they had promi&s;ed as much as we would have. Our General &s;ent him back again with another me&s;&s;age, and another &s;hot with him; and being come near unto them, they would not &s;uffer any more than one to approach them: whereupon our men let the Spaniard go unto them alone; who being at &s;ome good di&s;tance from them, they &s;taid but a &s;mall time together, before the &s;aid Hernando leaped
<PB N="181" REF="253">
up behind one of them, and rode away with them, notwith&s;tanding the damnable oaths which he had made continually to our General, never to for&s;ake him, but to die on his &s;ide before he would be fal&s;e. Our General, &s;eeing how he was dealt with, filled water all that day with good watch, and carried it on board: and night being come, he determined next day to &s;end into the country to find their town, and to have taken the &s;poil of it, and to have fired it, if they could have found it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of March, Captain Havers went up into the country, with 50 or 60 men, with their &s;hot and furniture with them, and we travelled &s;even or eight miles into the land: and, as we were marching along, we e&s;pied a number of herds of cattle, of kine and bullocks, which were wonderfully wild: we &s;aw al&s;o great plenty of hor&s;es, mares, and colts, which were very wild and unhandled: there is al&s;o great &s;tore of hares and conies, and plenty of partridges, and other wild fowls. The country is very fruitful, with fair fre&s;h rivers all along, full of wild-fowl of all &s;orts. Having travelled &s;o far, that we could go no farther for the mon&s;trous high mountains, we re&s;ted our&s;elves at a very fair fre&s;h river, running in and along fair low meadows, at the foot of the mountains, where every man drank of the river, and refre&s;hed him&s;elf. Having &s;o done, we returned to our &s;hips, the likelie&s;t way we thought their town would be; &s;o we travel|led all the day long, not &s;eeing any man, but we
<PB N="182" REF="254">
met with many wild dogs; yet there were two hundred hor&s;emen abroad that &s;ame day, by means of the Spaniard which they had taken from us the day before, who had told them that our force was but &s;mall, and that we were won|derfully weak; and, though they did e&s;py us that day, yet dur&s;t they not give the on&s;et upon us; for we marched along in array, and ob|&s;erved good order, whereby we &s;eemed a greater number than we were, until we came unto our &s;hips that night again.</P>
<P>The next day, being the fir&s;t of April, 1587, our men went on &s;hore to fill water at a pit which was a quarter of a mile from the water|&s;ide; and, being early hard at their bu&s;ine&s;s, were in no readine&s;s: mean while, there came pouring down from the hills almo&s;t two hundred hor&s;emen, and before our people could return to the rocks from the watering-place, twelve of them were cut off, part killed, and part taken pri&s;oners; the re&s;t were re&s;cued by our &s;oldiers who came from the rocks to meet with them; for though only fifteen of us had any wea|pons on &s;hore, yet we made the enemy retire in the end, with the lo&s;s of twenty-four of their men, after we had &s;kirmi&s;hed with them an hour.</P>
<P>After the lo&s;s of the&s;e men, we rode at anchor, and watered in de&s;pite of them, with good watch and ward, until the 5th of the &s;aid month.</P>
<P>The 5th day, we departed out of this bay of Quintero; and off from the bay there lieth a little i&s;land, about a league di&s;tant, whereon there
<PB N="183" REF="255">
are great &s;tore of penguins, and other fowls, whereof we took to &s;erve our turns, and &s;ailed away north, and north-by-we&s;t; for &s;o lieth the coa&s;t along this place.</P>
<P>The 15th, we came thwart of a place, which is called Morro-Moreno, which &s;tandeth in twenty-three degrees thirty minutes, and is an excellent good harbour: and there is an i&s;land which maketh it an harbour; for a &s;hip may go in at either end of the i&s;land. Here we went with our General on &s;hore, to the number of thirty men; and as &s;oon as we had effected our landing, the Indians of the place came down from the rocks to meet us, with fre&s;h-water and wood on their backs. They are in great awe of the Spaniards, and very &s;imple people, liv|ing mo&s;t &s;avagely: for they brought us to their dwellings, about two miles from the harbour, where we &s;aw their women and bedding, which is nothing but the &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t laid upon the ground; and over them, in&s;tead of hou&s;es, is nothing but five or &s;ix &s;ticks laid acro&s;s, which &s;tand upon forked &s;ticks &s;tuck in the ground, and a few boughs laid over them. Their diet is raw fi&s;h, which &s;tinketh mo&s;t vilely: and when any of them die, they bury their bows and ar|rows with them, and all that they have; for we opened one of their graves, and &s;aw the order of them. Their canoes or boats are very arti|ficially made of two &s;kins re&s;embling bladders, and are blown full at one end with quills: they have two of the&s;e bladders blown full, which are
<PB N="184" REF="256">
&s;ewed together, and made fa&s;t with a &s;inew of &s;ome wild bea&s;t; which, when they are in the water, &s;well, &s;o that they are as tight as may be. They go to &s;ea in the&s;e boats, and catch plenty of fi&s;h, but they u&s;e it in a bea&s;tly man|ner.</P>
<P>On the 23d, in the morning, we took a &s;mall bark, which came out of Arica road, which we kept and called the George. The men for&s;ook it, and went ha&s;tily away with their boat. Our Admiral's pinnace followed the boat, and the Hugh Gallant's boat took the bark: our Admiral's pinnace could not recover the boat before it got on &s;hore, but went along into the road of Arica, and laid aboard a great &s;hip of one hundred tons, riding in the road right before the town, but all the men and goods were gone out of her, only the bare &s;hip was left alone. They made three or four very fair &s;hots at the pinnace as &s;he was coming in, but mi&s;&s;ed her very narrowly with a minion-&s;hot which they had in the fort. Whereupon we came into the road with the Admiral and the Hugh Gallant: but the Content, which was the Vice-Admiral, was behind out of &s;ight; by means whereof, and for want of her boat to land men withal, we landed not: otherwi&s;e, if we had been together, our General with the company would re&s;olutely have landed to take the town, what&s;oever &s;hould have come of it. The cau&s;e why the Content &s;taid behind, was, that &s;he had found, about four|teen
<PB N="185" REF="257">
leagues to the &s;outhward of Arica, in a place where the Spaniards had landed a whole &s;hip's lading of botigas of wine of Ca&s;tile, whereof the &s;aid Content took into her as many as &s;he could conveniently carry, and came after us into the road of Arica the &s;ame day. By this time we perceived that the town had gathered all their power together, and al&s;o conveyed all their trea&s;ure away, and buried it, for they had heard of us. Now, becau&s;e it was very populous with the aid of one or two neighbouring places, our General &s;aw there was no landing without lo&s;s of many men; wherefore he gave over that en|terprize. While we rode at anchor they &s;hot at us, and our &s;hips &s;hot at them again for every &s;hot two. Moreover, our pinnace went in clo&s;e almo&s;t to the &s;hore, and fetched out another bark which rode there, in de&s;pite of all their forts, though they &s;hot &s;till at the pinnace, which they could never hit. After the&s;e things our General &s;ent a boat on &s;hore with a flag of truce, to know if they would redeem their great &s;hip or no: but they would not; for they had received &s;pecial commandment from the Vice|roy at Lima, not to buy any &s;hip, or ran&s;om any man, upon pain of death. Our General did this, in hopes to have redeemed &s;ome of our men, which were taken pri&s;oners on &s;hore by the hor&s;emen at Quintero, otherwi&s;e he would have made them no offer of parley.</P>
<P>The 25th, riding &s;till in the road, we &s;pied a &s;ail coming from the &s;outhward, and our Ge|neral
<PB N="186" REF="258">
&s;ent out his pinnace to meet her, with all our boats; but the town made &s;uch &s;igns from the hill with fires and tokens out of the watch-hou&s;e, that before our pinnace could get to them, they ran the bark on &s;hore two miles to the &s;outhward of the town; but they had little lei&s;ure to carry any thing with them, but all the men e&s;caped, among whom there were certain friars, for we &s;aw them in their friar's weeds as they ran on &s;hore. Many hor&s;emen came from the town to re&s;cue them and to carry them away, otherwi&s;e we had landed and taken or killed them: &s;o we went on board the bark as &s;he lay &s;unk, and fetched out the pillage; but there was nothing in it of any value: and we came on board our &s;hips again the &s;ame night, and the next morning we &s;et the great &s;hip on fire in the road, and &s;unk one of the barks, carrying the other along with us, and &s;o departed from thence, and went away north-we&s;t.</P>
<P>The 27th, we took a &s;mall bark which came from St. Jago; near unto Quintero, where we lo&s;t our men fir&s;t. In this bark was one George, a Greek, an intelligent pilot for all the coa&s;t of Chili. They were &s;ent to the city of Lima with letters of advice of us, and of the lo&s;s of our men: there were al&s;o in the &s;aid bark one Fleming and three Spaniards, and they were all &s;worn, and received the &s;acrament, before they came to &s;ea, by three or four friars, that, if we &s;hould chance to meet them they &s;hould throw tho&s;e letters overboard; which as we were giv|ing
<PB N="187" REF="259">
them chace with our pinnace, before we could reach them, they had accordingly thrown away. Yet our General wrought &s;o with them, that they did confe&s;s their errand; but he was fain to cau&s;e them to be tormented with their thumbs in a winch, and to repeat it &s;everal times with extreme pain: al&s;o he made the old Fleming believe that he would hang him, and the rope being about his neck, he was pulled up a little from the hatches; and yet he would not confe&s;s, chu&s;ing rather to die than he would be perjured.</P>
<P>The 3d of May, we came into a bay where are three little towns, which are called Paracca, Chincha, and Pi&s;ca; where &s;ome of us landed, and took certain hou&s;es wherein was bread, wine, figs, and hens: but the &s;ea went &s;o high that we could not land at the be&s;t of the towns, without &s;inking of our boats, and great hazard of us all. This place &s;tandeth in thirteen degrees and forty minutes to the &s;outhward of the Line.</P>
<P>The 5th of May, we departed from this har|bour, leaving the Content, our Vice-Admiral, at the i&s;land of Seals, by which means at that time we lo&s;t her company.</P>
<P>The 9th, we gave chace to a &s;ail, but we could not reach it.</P>
<P>The 10th day, the Hugh Gallant, in which bark I Francis Pretie was, lo&s;t company of our Admiral.</P>
<P>The 11th, we who were in the Hugh Gal|lant put into a bay which &s;tandeth in twelve de|grees
<PB N="188" REF="260">
forty minutes, in which bay we found a river of fre&s;h water about eight o'clock at night; and though we were but of &s;mall force, no more than one bark and eighteen men in it, yet we went on &s;hore to fill water; where, hav|ing filled one boat's lading, while our crew were going on board, two or three of our company which were on &s;hore, as they were going a little from the watering-place with their furni|ture about them, &s;pied where there were four or five hundred bags of meal on an heap co|vered with a few reeds; &s;o that night we filled water, and took as much meal as we thought good, which fell out well for us who were then lo&s;t, and &s;tood in need of victuals: and, by break of day in the morning, we came on board, and there &s;taid and rode until the afternoon; in which time the town, &s;eeing us ride there &s;till, brought down much cattle to the &s;ea &s;ide to have enticed us to come on &s;hore; but we &s;aw their intent, and weighed anchor, and departed the 12th day.</P>
<P>The 13th day at night, we put into a bay which &s;tandeth in nine degrees twenty minutes, where we &s;aw hor&s;emen. And that night we landed, namely, Mr. Bruer, captain; my&s;elf; Arthur Warford; John Way, preacher; John Newman; Andrew Wight; William Garge|field; and Henry Hilliard; and we eight only, having every man his harquebu&s;s and his furni|ture about him, marched three quarters of a mile along the &s;ea-&s;ide, where we found a boat
<PB N="189" REF="261">
of five or &s;ix tons hauled up dry on the &s;hore, about a cable's length from the water; and with extreme labour we launched the bark. When it was on float, Captain Bruer and I went in, while the re&s;t were fetching their things; but &s;ud|denly it was ready to &s;ink, and the Captain and I &s;tood up to the knees, laving out the water with our targets; but it &s;unk down fa&s;ter than we were able to free it, in&s;omuch that in the end we had much ado to &s;ave our&s;elves from drown|ing. When we were out, we &s;tood in great fear that our own boat, wherein we came on &s;hore, was &s;unk; for we could no where &s;ee it. How|beit, the Captain commanded them to keep it off for fear of the great &s;urge that went by the &s;hore, yet in the end we &s;pied it, and went on board by two and two, and were forced to wade up to the arm-pits &s;ixty paces into the &s;ea, be|fore we could get into the boat, by rea&s;on of the &s;hoalne&s;s; and then departed the fourteenth day in the morning.</P>
<P>The 16th, we took with the Hugh Gallant, being but &s;ixteen men of us in it, a large &s;hip which came from Guaianil, which was called the Lewis, and was of the burthen of three hundred tons, having twenty-four men in it, wherein was a pilot, one Gon&s;alvo de Ribas, whom we carried along with us, and a negroe called Emmanuel. The &s;hip was laden with nothing but timber and victuals, wherefore we left her &s;even or eight leagues from the land very
<PB N="190" REF="262">
leaky and ready to &s;ink: we &s;unk her boat, and took away her fore&s;ail and &s;ome provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The 17th of May, we met with our Admiral again, and all the re&s;t of our fleet: they had taken two &s;hips, the one laden with &s;ugar, me|la&s;&s;es, maize, &s;kins, many packs of pintadoes, &s;ome marmalade, and a thou&s;and hens. The other &s;hip was laden with wheat-meal, and boxes of marmalade. One of the&s;e &s;hips, which had the chief merchandize in it, was worth twenty thou&s;and pounds, if it had been in England, or in any other part of Chri&s;tendom, where we might have &s;old it. We filled all our &s;hips with as much as we could of the&s;e goods; the re&s;t we burnt and the &s;hips al&s;o, and &s;et the men and women that were not killed on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The 20th day in the morning, we came into the road of Paita; and, being at an anchor, our General landed with &s;ixty or &s;eventy men, &s;kir|mi&s;hed with &s;ome of the town, and drove them all to flight to the top of the hill which is over the town; except a few &s;laves and &s;ome others who were of the meaner &s;ort, who were com|manded by the Governor to &s;tay below in the town at a place which was building for a fort, having with them a bloody en&s;ign, being in number about an hundred men. Now, as we were rowing between the &s;hips and the &s;hore, our gunner &s;hot off a great piece out of one of the barks, and the &s;hot fell among them, and made them to fly from the fort, as fa&s;t as they could run; but, having got up upon the hill,

they, in their cum, &s;hot among us with their &s;mall-&s;hot. After we were landed, and had taken the town, we ran upon them and chaced them &s;o fiercely for the &s;pace of an hour, that we drove them in the end away by force; and, being got up the hills, we found where they had hid what they had brought out of the town. We al&s;o found the quantity of twenty-five pounds weight of &s;ilver in pieces of eight, and abundance of hou&s;hold &s;tuff, and &s;torehou&s;es full of all kinds of wares. But our General would not &s;uffer the men to carry much cloth or ap|parel away, becau&s;e they &s;hould not clog them|&s;elves with burdens; for he knew not whether our enemies were provided with fire-arms ac|cording to the number of their men, for they were five men to one of us, and we had an Engli&s;h mile and an half to our &s;hips. Being come down in &s;afety to the town, which was very well built, and kept very clean in every &s;treet, with a town-hou&s;e or guildhall in the mid&s;t of it, and had to the number of two or three hundred hou&s;es at lea&s;t in it; we &s;et it on fire, and burnt it to the ground, and goods to the va|lue of five or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds. There was al&s;o a bark riding at anchor in the road, which we &s;et on fire and departed, directing our cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Puna.</P>
<P>The 25th of May, we arrived at the i&s;land of Puna, where is a very good harbour. There we found a great &s;hip of 250 tons riding at an|chor with all her furniture, which was ready to
<PB N="192" REF="265">
be hauled on ground, for there is a &s;pecial good place for that purpo&s;e. We &s;unk it and went on &s;hore, where the Lord of the i&s;land dwelt, who had a &s;umptuous dwelling, which was by the water &s;ide, exceedingly well contrived, with many very &s;ingular good rooms and cham|bers in it, and out of every chamber was fram|ed a gallery, with a &s;tately pro&s;pect towards the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and into the i&s;land on the other &s;ide, with a magnificent hall below, and a very great &s;torehou&s;e at one end of the hall, which was filled with botigas of pitch and ba&s;t to make cables with; for the mo&s;t part of the cables in the South Sea are made upon that i&s;land. This great Ca&s;ique obliged all the Indians on the i&s;land to work and trudge for him: he is an In|dian born, but is married to a beautiful woman who is a Spaniard, by rea&s;on of his plea&s;ant ha|bitation and his great wealth.</P>
<P>This Spani&s;h woman, his wife, is honoured as a Queen in the i&s;land, and never walketh upon the ground on foot, but accounteth it too ba&s;e a thing for her; but when her plea&s;ure is to take the air, or to go abroad, &s;he is always carried in a &s;edan upon four men's &s;houlders, with a veil or canopy over her, to &s;hade her from the &s;un or the wind, having her gentlewoman &s;till attend|ing about her, with a great troop of the be&s;t men in the i&s;land with her. But both &s;he and the lord of the i&s;land, with all the Indians in the town, were nearly fled out of the i&s;land before we could get to an anchor, by rea&s;on we
<PB N="193" REF="266">
were becalmed before we could get in, and were gone over unto the main land, having carried with them 100,000 crowns, which we knew by a Captain of the i&s;land, an Indian, whom we had taken at &s;ea as we were coming into the road, being in a bal&s;a or a canoe for a &s;py to &s;ee what we were.</P>
<P>The 27th, our General him&s;elf, with certain &s;hot and &s;ome targetliers, went over to the main unto the place where this Indian Captain told us the Ca&s;ique, who was Lord of all the i&s;land, was gone unto, and had carried all his trea&s;ure with him: but, at our coming to the place where we went to land, we found newly arrived there four or five great bal&s;as laden with plan|tains, bags of meal, and many other kinds of victuals. Our General marvelled what they were, and what they meant, a&s;king the Indian guide, and commanding him to &s;peak the truth upon his life. Being then bound fa&s;t, he an|&s;wered, being very much aba&s;hed, as well as our company were, that he neither knew from whence they &s;hould come, nor who they &s;hould be, for never a man was in either of the bal&s;as; yet he had told our General before, that it was an ea&s;y matter to take the &s;aid Ca|&s;ique and all his trea&s;ure; and that, there were but three or four hou&s;es &s;tanding in a de&s;art place, and no re&s;i&s;tance; and that if he found it not &s;o, he might hang him. Again being de|manded to &s;peak upon his life what he thought the&s;e bal&s;as &s;hould be? he an&s;wered, that he
<PB N="194" REF="267">
could not &s;ay what they were, nor from whence they &s;hould come, except it was to carry &s;ixty &s;oldiers, who he did hear were to go to a place called Guaiaquil, which was about &s;ix leagues from the &s;aid i&s;land, where two or three of the King's &s;hips were on the &s;tocks in building, and where there were continually an hundred &s;oldiers in garri&s;on, who had heard of us, and had &s;ent for &s;ixty more, for fear of burning of the &s;hips and town. Our General, not any whit di&s;cou|raged, either at the &s;ight of the bal&s;as unlooked for, or at hearing of the &s;ixty &s;oldiers not until then &s;poken of, bravely animated his company to the exploit, went pre&s;ently forward, being in the night in a mo&s;t de&s;art path through the woods, until he came to the place; where, as it &s;eemed, they had kept watch either at the water-&s;ide, or at the hou&s;es, or at both, and were newly gone out of the hou&s;es, having &s;o &s;hort warning that they left the meat both boiling and roa&s;ting at the fire, and were fled with their trea|&s;ure with them, or el&s;e buried it where it could not be &s;ound. Our company took hens, and &s;uch things as we thought good, and came away.</P>
<P>The 29th, our General went in the &s;hip's boat unto a little i&s;land adjoining, whither the Ca&s;ique, who was Lord of Rena, had cau&s;ed all the hangings of his chambers, which were Cor|dovan leather, all gilded over, and painted very fair and rich, with all his hou&s;hold &s;tuff, and all the &s;hip's tackling which were riding in the road at our coming in, with great &s;tore of nails, &s;pikes
<PB N="195" REF="268">
of iron, and very many other things, to be con|veyed; all which we found, and brought away what our General thought requi&s;ite for the &s;hips.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is very plea&s;ant for all the de|lights of life, and fruitful; but there are no mines of gold or &s;ilver in it. There are, at lea&s;t, 200 hou&s;es in the town about the Ca&s;ique's pa|lace, and as many in one or two towns more upon the i&s;land, which is almo&s;t as big as the I&s;le of Wight, in England. There is planted, on the one &s;ide of the Ca&s;ique's hou&s;e, a fair garden with all herbs growing in it, and at the lower end a well of fre&s;h water, and round about it are trees &s;et, whereon bombazine cotton grow|eth after this manner: The tops of the trees grow full of cods, out of which the cotton groweth, and in the cotton is a &s;eed of the big|ne&s;s of a pea, and in every cod there are &s;even or eight of the&s;e &s;eeds; and if the cotton be not gathered when it is ripe, then the&s;e &s;eeds fall from it and &s;pring again.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in this garden fig trees, which bear continually; al&s;o pompions, melons, cu|cumbers, raddi&s;hes, ro&s;emary, and thyme, with many other herbs and roots. At the other end of the hou&s;e there is al&s;o another orchard, where grow oranges, &s;weet and &s;our lemons, pomegra|nates, and limes, with divers other fruits. There is very good pa&s;ture ground in this i&s;land; and there are many hor&s;es, oxen, bullocks, &s;heep very fat and fair, a great many goats, which are very tame, and are u&s;ed continually to be milked.
<PB N="196" REF="269">
They have al&s;o abundance of pigeons, turkies, and ducks of prodigious bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a very large and great church near to the Ca&s;ique's hou&s;e, whither he cau&s;ed all the Indians in the i&s;land to come and hear ma&s;s, for he him&s;elf was made a chri&s;tian when married to the Spani&s;h woman before &s;poken of; and upon his conver&s;ion he cau&s;ed the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects to be chri&s;tened. In this church was an high altar, with a crucifix, and five bells hang|ing in one end thereof. We burnt the church, and brought the bells away.</P>
<P>By this time we had hauled on ground our Admiral, and made her clean, burnt her keel, pitched and tarred her, and had hauled her on float again; and, in the mean time, kept watch in the great hou&s;e both night and day.</P>
<P>The 2d of June, in the morning, by day-break, every one of the watch having gone abroad to &s;eek provi&s;ions, &s;ome one way and &s;ome another, &s;ome for hens, &s;ome for &s;heep, &s;ome for goats; upon a &s;udden there came down upon us an hundred &s;oldiers, with mu&s;|quets, and an en&s;ign, which were landed on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land that night, and all the Indians of the i&s;land along with them, every one with weapons, and their baggage after them; which happened by means of a negroe, who&s;e name was Emmanuel, who fled from us at our fir&s;t landing there. Thus, being taken at a di&s;|advantage, we had the wor&s;t, for our company did not exceed &s;ixteen or twenty, whereof they
<PB N="197" REF="270">
had &s;lain one or two before they were come to the hou&s;es; yet we &s;kirmi&s;hed with them an hour and a half. At la&s;t, being greatly over|charged with multitudes, we were driven down from the hill to the water-&s;ide, and there we kept them in play a while, until in the end our halberdier, who had kept the way of the hill, and had &s;lain a couple of them as he breathed him&s;elf, had an honourable death, for a &s;hot &s;truck him to the heart; who, feeling him&s;elf mortally wounded, cried to God for mercy, and fell down dead. But, &s;oon after, the enemy was driven back from the bank &s;ide to the green; and, in the end, our boat came, and carried as many of our men as could go in her without hazard of &s;inking; but one of our men was &s;hot through the head with his own piece, being a &s;nap-hand, as he was getting into the boat. Four of us were left behind, which the boat could not carry, of whom my&s;elf was one, who had our &s;hot ready, and retired into a cliff until the boat came again, which was pre&s;ently after they had carried the re&s;t on board. There were forty-&s;ix of the enemy &s;lain by us, whereof they dragged &s;ome into bu&s;hes, and &s;ome into old hou&s;es, which we found afterwards. We lo&s;t only 12 of our men.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we went on &s;hore again with 70 men, and had a fre&s;h &s;kirmi&s;h with the ene|my, and made them retire. This done, we &s;et fire to the town, and burnt it to the ground; and, &s;hortly after, made havock of their fields,
<PB N="198" REF="271">
orchards, and gardens, and burnt four great &s;hips more, which were building on the &s;tocks.</P>
<P>The 3d of June, the Content, which was our Vice-Admiral, was hauled on ground to grave at the &s;ame place, in &s;pite of the Spaniards; and al&s;o our pinnace was new trimmed.</P>
<P>The 5th, we departed out of the road of Puna, where we remained eleven days, and turned up to a place which is called Rio Dolce, where we watered; at which place al&s;o we &s;unk our Rear-Admiral, called the Hugh Gallant, for want of men, being a bark of 40 tons.</P>
<P>The 10th, we &s;et the Indians on &s;hore, which we had taken before as we were coming into the road of Puna.</P>
<P>The 11th, we departed from Rio Dolce.</P>
<P>The 12th, we doubled the Equinoctial Line, and continued our cour&s;e northwards all that month.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of July, we had &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Nueva E&s;panna, being four leagues di&s;tant from land, in the latitude of 10 degrees to the north|ward of the Line.</P>
<P>The 9th, we took a new &s;hip of 120 tons burthen, wherein was one Michael Sancius, whom our General took to &s;erve his turn to water along the coa&s;t; for he was one of the be&s;t coa&s;ters in the South Sea. This Michael Sancius was a provincial born in Mar&s;eilles, and was the fir&s;t man that told us news of the great &s;hip called the Santa Anna, which we afterwards took coming from the Philippines.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="272">There were &s;ix men more in this new &s;hip. We took her &s;ails, ropes, and fire-wood, to &s;erve our turns, &s;et her on fire, and kept the men.</P>
<P>The 10th, we took another bark, which was going with advice of us and our &s;hips all along the coa&s;t, as Michael Sancius told us; but all company that were in the bark were fled on &s;hore. Neither of the&s;e &s;hips had any goods in them; for they came both from Son&s;onate, in the province of Guatimala; the new &s;hip, for fear we &s;hould have taken her in the road; and the bark, to carry news along the coa&s;t, which bark we al&s;o &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>The 26th, we came to anchor in ten fathoms, in the river of Copalita, where we intended to water; and that &s;ame night we departed with thirty-two men in the pinnace, and rowed to Aguatulco, which is but two leagues from the afore&s;aid river, and &s;tandeth in 15 deg. 40 min. to the northward of the Equinoctial Line.</P>
<P>The 27th day, in the morning, by break of day, we came into the road of Aguatulco, where we found a bark of 50 tons, which was come from Son&s;onate, laden with cocoas and anil, which they had there landed; and the men were all &s;led on &s;hore. We landed there, and burnt the town, with the church and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which was very fair and large, in which hou&s;e were 600 bags of anil to dye cloth, every bag whereof was worth 40 crowns; and 400 bags of cocoas, every bag whereof is worth 10 crowns. The&s;e cocoas go among them for meat and
<PB N="200" REF="273">
money; for 150 of them are in value one rial of plate in ready payment. They are very like an almond, but are not &s;o plea&s;ant in ta&s;te. They eat them, and make drink of them: this the owner of the &s;hip told us. I found in this town, before we burnt it, a fla&s;ket full of boxes of balm. After we had &s;poiled and burned the town, wherein there were &s;ome hundred hou&s;es, the owner of the &s;hip came down out of the hills with a flag of truce unto us, who before with all the re&s;t of the town&s;men run away, and at length came on board our pinnace upon Captain Havers' word of &s;afe return. We car|ried him to the river of Copalita, where out &s;hips rode. When we came to our General, he cau&s;ed him to be &s;et on &s;hore in &s;afety the &s;ame night, becau&s;e he came upon the Captain's word.</P>
<P>The 28th, we &s;et &s;ail from Copalita, becau&s;e the &s;ea was &s;o great that we could not fill wa|ter, and ran the &s;ame night into the road of Aguatulco.</P>
<P>The 29th, our General landed, and took with him thirty men two miles into the woods, where we took a Me&s;tizo, who&s;e name was Mi|chael de Truxillo, who was cu&s;tomer of that town, and we found with him two chambers full of his &s;tuff; we brought him and his &s;tuff on board: and whereas I &s;ay he was a Me&s;tizo, it is to be under&s;tood, that a Me&s;tizo is one who hath a Spaniard to his father, and an Indian to his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="274">The 2d day of Augu&s;t, having watered, and examined the &s;aid Me&s;tizo and &s;et him on &s;hore again, we departed from the port of Aguatulco the &s;ame night; which &s;tandeth, as I &s;aid be|fore, in 15 deg. and 40 min. to the northward of the Line. Here we over&s;lipped the haven of Acapulco, from whence the &s;hips are fitted out for the Philippines.</P>
<P>The 24th, our General with thirty of us went with the pinnace to an haven called Puerto de Natividad, where we had intelligence by Mi|chael Sancius that there &s;hould be a pinnace; but, before we could get thither, the &s;aid pin|nace was gone to fi&s;h for pearls twelve leaves farther, as we were informed by certain Indians whom we found there. We took a mullatto in this place in his bed, who was &s;ent with letters of advice concerning us along the coa&s;t of Nueva Galicia, who&s;e hor&s;e we killed. We took his letters, left him behind, &s;et fire to the hou&s;es, and burnt two new &s;hips of 200 tons each which were building there on the &s;tocks, and came on board of our &s;hips again.</P>
<P>The 26th, we came into the bay of St. Jago, where we watered at a fre&s;h river, along which river many plantains were growing. Here is abundance of fre&s;h fi&s;h; here al&s;o &s;ome of our company dragged for pearls, and caught &s;ome quantity.</P>
<P>The 2d of September, we departed from St. Jago, at four o'clock in the evening. The bay of St. Jago &s;tandeth in nineteen degrees
<PB N="202" REF="275">
and eighteen minutes to the northward of the Line.</P>
<P>The 3d, we arrived in a little bay a league to the we&s;tward of Port de Natividad, called Ma|lacca, which is a very good place to ride in; and this day, about twelve o'clock, our Gene|ral landed with thirty men, and went up to a town of Indians which was two leagues from the road, which town is called Acatlan: there were in it about 20 or 30 hou&s;es, and a church which we defaced, and came on board the &s;ame night. All the people fled out of the town at the &s;ight of us.</P>
<P>The 4th, we departed from the road of Ma|lacca, and &s;ailed along the coa&s;t. The 8th we came to the road of Chacalla, in which bay there are two little hou&s;es by the water-&s;ide. This bay is 18 leagues from the Cape de los Corientes.</P>
<P>The 9th, in the morning, our General &s;ent up Captain Havers with forty men of us before day, and, Michael Sancius being our guide, we went unto a place about two leagues up into the country, in a mo&s;t ob&s;cure de&s;art path, through the woods and wilderne&s;s, and in the end we came to a place where we took three hou&s;holders with their wives and children, and &s;ome Indians, one carpenter (who was a Spaniard), and a Por|tugue&s;e. We bound them all, and made them come to the &s;ea-&s;ide with us: our General made their wives fetch us plantains, lemons, oranges, pine-apples, and other fruits, whereof they had
<PB N="203" REF="276">
abundance, and &s;o let their hu&s;bands depart, ex|cept Sembrano, the Spani&s;h carpenter, and Diego, the Portugue&s;e, and the tenth day we departed from the road.</P>
<P>The 12th, we arrived at a little i&s;land called the i&s;le of St. Andrew, on which there is great &s;tore of fowl and wood; where we dried and &s;alted as many of the fowls as we thought good. We al&s;o killed there abundance of &s;eals and oguanos, which are a kind of &s;erpents with four feet, and a long &s;harp tail, &s;trange to them who have not &s;een them, but they are very good meat. We rode here until the 17th, at which time we departed.</P>
<P>The 24th, we arrived in the road of Ma&s;|&s;atlan, in twenty-three degrees thirty minutes, ju&s;t under the Tropic of Cancer. It is a very great river within, but is barred at the mouth; and upon the north &s;ide of the bar without is good fre&s;h water, but there is much difficulty in filling it, becau&s;e at low water it is &s;hoal half a mile off the &s;hore. There is great &s;tore of fre&s;h fi&s;h in this bay, and good fruits up in the coun|try, whereof we had &s;ome, though not without danger.</P>
<P>The 27th, we departed from the road of Ma&s;|&s;atlan, and ran to an i&s;land which is a league to the northward of the &s;aid Ma&s;&s;atlan, where we trimmed our &s;hips, and new-built our pinnace. There is a little i&s;land a quarter of a league from it, on which are &s;eals; where a Spani&s;h pri|&s;oner, who&s;e name was Domingo, being &s;ent to
<PB N="204" REF="277">
wa&s;h &s;hirts, with one of our men to keep him, made his e&s;cape and &s;wam to the main, which was an Engli&s;h mile di&s;tant; at which place we had &s;een thirty or forty Spaniards and In|dians, who were hor&s;emen and kept watch there, and came from a town called Chiametla, which was eleven leagues up into the country, as Mi|chael Sancius told us. We found upon the i&s;land where we trimmed our pinnace, fre&s;h wa|ter, by digging two or three feet deep into the &s;and, where no water nor &s;ign of water was before to be perceived; otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t have gone back 20 or 30 leagues to water, which might have occa&s;ioned our mi&s;&s;ing the prey we had long waited for: but one Flores, a Spaniard, who was al&s;o a pri&s;oner with us, made a motion to dig in the &s;ands. Now, our General, having had experience before of the like, commanded to put his motion in practice, and, digging three feet deep, we found very good and fre&s;h water: &s;o we watered our &s;hips, and might have filled a thou&s;and tons more if we had plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>We &s;taid in this i&s;land until the ninth day of October, and then departed at night for the Cape of St. Lucar, which is on the we&s;t &s;ide of the point of California.</P>
<P>The 14th, we fell in with the Cape of St. Lu|car, which cape is very like the Needles at the I&s;le of Wight, and within the &s;aid cape is a great bay, called by the Spaniards Aguada Se|gura, into which bay falleth a fair fre&s;h river, about which many Indians u&s;e to keep. We
<PB N="205" REF="278">
watered in the river, and lay off and on with the &s;aid cape of St. Lucar, until the 4th of No|vember, and had the winds hanging &s;till we&s;t|erly.</P>
<P>The 4th of November, beating up and down upon the head-land of California, in 23 degrees 40 minutes to the northward, between &s;even and eight o'clock in the morning, one of the company of our Admiral, who was the trum|peter of the &s;hip, going up unto the top, e&s;pied a &s;ail bearing in from the &s;ea with the cape; whereupon he cried, with no &s;mall joy to him|&s;elf and all the company, A &s;ail! a &s;ail! With which chearful word, the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, and divers others of the company, went al&s;o up to the main-top, who, perceiving his &s;peech to be very true, gave information unto our Gene|ral of this happy news, who was no le&s;s glad than the cau&s;e required: whereupon he gave in charge pre&s;ently unto the whole company, to put all things in readine&s;s; which being per|formed, he gave them chace for three or four hours, &s;tanding with our be&s;t advantage, and working for the wind. In the afternoon we got up to them, giving them a broad&s;ide with our great ordnance, and a volley of &s;mall &s;hot, and pre&s;ently laid the &s;hip aboard, whereof the King of Spain was owner, which was Admiral of the South Sea, called St. Anna, and thought to be &s;even hundred tons in burthen. Now, as we were ready on the &s;hip's &s;ide to enter her, there not being above fifty or &s;ixty men at mo&s;t in
<PB N="206" REF="279">
our &s;hip, we perceived that the Captain of the Santa Anna had made &s;ights fore and aft, and laid their &s;ails clo&s;e on their poop, their mid|&s;hip, with their foreca&s;tle, and not one man to be &s;een, they &s;tanding &s;o clo&s;e under their &s;ights, with lances, javelins, rapiers, targets, and an in|numerable quantity of large &s;tones, which they threw overboard upon our heads, and into our &s;hips &s;o fa&s;t, and being &s;o many of them, that they put us off the &s;hip again, with the lo&s;s of two of our men, who were &s;lain, and four or five wounded. But for all this, we new trim|med our &s;ails, and fitted every man his furniture, and gave them a fre&s;h encounter with our great ordnance, and al&s;o with our &s;mall &s;hot, raking them through and through, to the killing and wounding of many of their men. Their Cap|tain, &s;till like a valiant man, with his company, &s;tood very &s;toutly unto his clo&s;e fights, not yielding as yet. Our General encouraging his men afre&s;h, with the whole noi&s;e of trumpets, gave them the other encounter with our great ordnance, and all our &s;mall &s;hot, to the great di&s;couragement of our enemies, raking them through in divers places, killing and wounding many of their men. They being thus di&s;cou|raged and &s;poiled, and their &s;hip being in ha|zard of &s;inking, by rea&s;on of the great &s;hot which were made, whereof &s;ome were under water, after five or &s;ix hours fight, &s;et out a flag of truce, and parlied for mercy, de&s;iring our General to &s;ave their lives, and to take their

goods, and that they would pre&s;ently yield. Our General promi&s;ed them mercy, and willed them to &s;trike their &s;ails, and to hoi&s;t out their boat, and to come on board: which news they were full glad to hear, and pre&s;ently &s;truck their &s;ails, hoi&s;ted out their boat, and one of their chief merchants came on board unto our Gene|ral, and, falling down upon his knees, offered to have ki&s;&s;ed our General's feet, and craved mer|cy. Our General pardoned both him and the re&s;t, upon promi&s;e of their true dealing with him and his company, concerning &s;uch riches as were in the &s;hip; and &s;ent for their Captain and pilot, who, at their coming, u&s;ed the like duty and reverence as the former did. Our General promi&s;ed their lives, and good u&s;age. The &s;aid Captain and pilot pre&s;ently certified the General what goods they had on board, viz. 122,000 pezoes of gold; and the re&s;t of the riches that the &s;hip was laden with, were &s;ilks, &s;attins, da|ma&s;ks, with mu&s;k, and divers other merchan|dize, and great plenty of all manner of provi|&s;ions, with the choice of many con&s;erves, and &s;everal &s;orts of very good wines. The&s;e things being made known to the General by the afore|&s;aid Captain and pilot, they were commanded to &s;tay on board the De&s;ire; and on the 6th day of November following we went into an har|bour, which is called by the Spaniards Aguada Segura, or Puerto Seguro.</P>
<P>Here the whole company of Spaniards, both men and women, to the number of 190 per&s;ons, were &s;et on &s;hore; where they had a fair river
<PB N="208" REF="281">
of fre&s;h water, with great plenty of fre&s;h fi&s;h, fowl, and wood, and al&s;o many hares and conies upon the main land. Our General al&s;o gave them plenty of provi&s;ions, garvances, pea&s;on, and &s;ome wine. Al&s;o they had all the &s;ails of their &s;hip to make them tents on &s;hore, with licence to take &s;uch &s;tore of planks as &s;hould be &s;uffi|cient to make them a bark. Then we fell to heaving in of our goods, &s;haring of the trea&s;ure, and allotting to every man his portion; in di|vi&s;ion whereof, the 8th of this month, many of the company fell into a mutiny again&s;t our Ge|neral, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were in the Content, which were neverthele&s;s pacified for the time.</P>
<P>On the 17th day of November, which is the day of the happy coronation of her Maje&s;ty, our General commanded all his ordnance to be &s;hot off, with the &s;mall &s;hot, both in his own &s;hip, and in the Content, which was our Vice-Admiral. This being done, the &s;ame night we had many fire-works, and more ordnance di&s;|charged, to the great admiration of all the Spa|niards who were there, for the mo&s;t of them had never &s;een the like before.</P>
<P>This ended, our General di&s;charged the Cap|tain, and gave him a royal reward, with provi&s;ion for his own and company's defence again&s;t the Indians, both of &s;words, targets, pieces, &s;hot, and powder, to his great contentment. But before his departure, he took out of this great &s;hip two young lads born in Japan, who could both read
<PB N="209" REF="282">
and write their own language; the elde&s;t, being about twenty years old, was named Chri&s;topher; the other was called Co&s;mus, about &s;eventeen years of age; both of very good capacity. He took al&s;o with him, out of their &s;hip, three boys born in the i&s;les of Manilla; the one about fif|teen, the other about thirteen, the younge&s;t about nine years of age: the name of the elde&s;t was Alphon&s;o, the &s;econd Anthony de Da&s;i, the third remaineth with the Right Honourable the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex. He al&s;o took from them one Nicholas Roderigo, a Portugue&s;e, who had not only been in Canton, and other parts of China, but had al&s;o been in the i&s;lands of Japan, being a country mo&s;t rich in &s;ilver mines, and had al&s;o been in the Philippines. He took al&s;o from them a Spaniard, who&s;e name was Thomas de Er&s;ola, who was a very good pilot from Aca|pulco, and the coa&s;t of Nueva E&s;panna, unto the i&s;lands of Ladrones, where the Spaniards put in to water, &s;ailing between Acapulco, and the Philippines; in which i&s;les of Ladrones they found fre&s;h-water plantains, and potatoe roots: howbeit, the people are very rude, and hea|thens.</P>
<P>The 19th day of November afore&s;aid, about three o'clok in the afternoon, our General cau&s;ed the King's &s;hip to be &s;et on fire, which, having to the quantity of 500 tons of goods in her, we &s;aw burnt unto the water, and then gave them a piece of ordnance, and &s;et &s;ail joyfully homewards towards England, with a fair wind,
<PB N="210" REF="283">
which by this time was come about to ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t; and, night growing near, we left the Content a &s;tern of us, which was not as yet come out of the road: and here, thinking &s;he would have overtaken us, we lo&s;t her company, and never &s;aw her after.</P>
<P>We were &s;ailing from this haven of Aguada Segura, in California, unto the i&s;les of Ladrones, the re&s;t of November, and all December, and &s;o forth until the 3d of January, 1588, with a fair wind, for the &s;pace of forty-five days; and we e&s;teemed it to be between &s;eventeen and eighteen hundred leagues.</P>
<P>The 3d of January, by &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we had &s;ight of one of the i&s;lands of Ladrones, called the i&s;land of Guar&s;a, &s;tanding in 13 deg. 40 min. towards the north; and, &s;ail|ing with a gentle gale before the wind, by one or two o'clock in the afternoon we were come within two leagues of the i&s;land, where we met with &s;ixty or &s;eventy &s;ail of canoes, full of &s;a|vages, who came off to &s;ea unto us, and brought with them in their canoes, plantains, cocoas, potatoe-roots, and fre&s;h fi&s;h, which they had caught at &s;ea, and held them up unto us for to truck, or exchange with us; which, when we perceived, we made fa&s;t little pieces of old iron upon &s;mall cords and fi&s;hing lines, and &s;o veered the iron into their canoes; and they caught hold of them, and took off the iron, and in exchange of it they would make fa&s;t unto the line, either a potatoe-root, or a bundle of plantains, which
<PB N="211" REF="284">
we hauled in: and thus our company exchang|ed with them, until they had &s;atisfied them&s;elves with as much as did content them; yet we could not be rid of them; for, afterwards, they were &s;o thick about the &s;hip, that it &s;temmed and broke one or two of their canoes; but the men &s;aved them&s;elves, being in every canoe four, &s;ix, or eight per&s;ons, all naked, and excellent &s;wimmers and divers. They are of a tawny colour, mar|vellou&s;ly fat, and ordinarily bigger of &s;tature than the mo&s;t of our men in England, wearing their hair very long, yet &s;ome of them have it made up and tied with a knot on the crown, and &s;ome with two knots, much like unto their im|ages, which we &s;aw them have carved in wood, and &s;tanding in the head of their boats, like unto the images of the devil. Their canoes were as artificially made as any that ever we had &s;een, con&s;idering they were made and contrived with|out any edged tool: they are not above half a fa|thom in breadth, and in length &s;ome &s;even or eight fathoms, and their heads and &s;terns are both alike: they are made out with rafts of canes and reeds on the &s;tarboard-&s;ide, with ma&s;t and &s;ail: their &s;ail is made of mats of &s;edges &s;quare or triangle ways; and they &s;ail as well right again&s;t the wind as before it. The&s;e &s;a|vages followed us &s;o long that we could not be rid of them; until in the end our General com|manded our harquebu&s;&s;es to be made ready, and he him&s;elf fired one of them, and the re&s;t &s;hot at them; but they were &s;o nimble, that we could
<PB N="212" REF="285">
not di&s;cern whether they were killed or not, be|cau&s;e they could fall backward into the &s;ea and prevent us by diving.</P>
<P>The 14th, by break of day, we fell in with an head-land of the Philippines, which is called Cabo del Spirito Santo, which is of very great bigne&s;s and length; high land in the mid&s;t of it, and very low land, as the cape lieth ea&s;t and we&s;t, trending far into the &s;ea to the we&s;tward. This cape or i&s;land is di&s;tant from the i&s;le of Guana 310 leagues. We were in &s;ailing of this cour&s;e eleven days, with &s;cant winds and foul weather, bearing no &s;ail two or three nights. This i&s;land &s;tandeth in thirteen degrees, and is inhabited for the mo&s;t part by heathens, and very woody through the whole i&s;land. It is &s;hort of the chiefe&s;t i&s;land of the Philippines, called Manilla, about &s;ixty leagues. Manilla is well planted, and inhabited by Spaniards to the number of &s;ix or &s;even hundred per&s;ons, who dwell in a town unwalled, which hath three or four &s;mall block|hou&s;es, part made of wood and part of &s;tone, being indeed of no great &s;trength. They have one or two &s;mall gallies belonging to the town. It is a very rich place in gold and many other commodities; and they have yearly traffic from Acapulco, in Nueva E&s;panna, and al&s;o twenty or thirty &s;hips from China, and from the San|guelos, which bringeth them many &s;orts of mer|chandize. The merchants of China, and the Sanguelos are part Moors and part heathens; they bring great quantities of gold with them,
<PB N="213" REF="286">
which they traffic and exchange for &s;ilver, and give weight for weight. The&s;e Sanguelos are men of great genius for inventing and making all manner of things, e&s;pecially in all handi|crafts and &s;ciences; and every one is &s;o expert, perfect, and &s;kilful in his faculty, that few or no Chri&s;tians are able to go beyond them in that which they take in hand. For drawing and em|broidering upon &s;attin, &s;ilk, or lawn, either bea&s;t, fowl, fi&s;h, or worm, for liveline&s;s and perfectne&s;s both in &s;ilk, &s;ilver, gold, and pearl, they excel.</P>
<P>The 14th, at night, we entered the &s;traits between the i&s;land of Lucon and the i&s;land of Camlaia.</P>
<P>The 15th day, we fell in with an i&s;land called Capul, and had, betwixt that and another i&s;land, a very narrow pa&s;&s;age, occa&s;ioned by a ledge of rocks, lying off the point of the i&s;land of Ca|pul, and no danger, but water enough a good way off. Within the point there is a fine bay, and a very good harbour in four fathoms wa|ter, within a cable's length of the &s;hore. Our &s;hip was no &s;ooner come to an anchor, than pre&s;ently there came a canoe rowing on board us, in which was one of the chief Ca&s;iques of the i&s;land, whereof there are &s;even, who, &s;uppo&s;|ing that we were Spaniards, brought us potatoe-roots, which they call camotas, and green co|coas, in exchange for which we gave his com|pany linnen to the quantity of a yard for four cocoas, and as much linnen for a ba&s;ket of po|tatoe-roots,
<PB N="214" REF="287">
of a quart in quantity, which roots are very good eating, and very &s;weet either roa&s;ted or boiled.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;ique's &s;kin was carved and cut with various coloured &s;trakes and devices all over his body; we kept him &s;till on board, and cau&s;ed him to &s;end tho&s;e men who brought him on board back to the i&s;land, to invite the re&s;t of the principal men to come on board: who were no &s;ooner gone on &s;hore, than pre&s;ently the people of the i&s;land came down with their cocoas and potatoe-roots, and the re&s;t of the Ca&s;iques like|wi&s;e came on board, and brought with them hens and hogs. They u&s;ed the &s;ame order with us which they do with the Spaniards; for they took for every hog, which they call balboye, eight rials of plate, and for every hen or cock one rial of plate. Thus we rode at anchor all that day, doing nothing but buying roots, co|coas, hens, hogs, and &s;uch things as they brought, refre&s;hing our&s;elves very much.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, at night, Nicholas Roderigo, the Portugue&s;e whom we had taken out of the great Santa Anna, at the Cape of California, de&s;ired to &s;peak with our General in &s;ecret; which, when our General under&s;tood, he &s;ent for him, and a&s;ked him what he had to &s;ay to him. The Portugue&s;e made him an&s;wer, That, altho' he had offended his wor&s;hip heretofore, yet now he had vowed his faith and true &s;ervice to him; and, in re&s;pect whereof, he neither could nor would conceal &s;uch trea&s;on as was plotting
<PB N="215" REF="288">
again&s;t him and his company; which was this, that the Spaniard who was taken out of the great Santa Anna for a pilot, who&s;e name was Thomas de Er&s;ola, had written a letter &s;ecretly, &s;ealed it, and locked it up in his che&s;t, mean|ing to convey it, by the inhabitants of this i&s;land, to Manilla; the contents whereof were, that there had been two Engli&s;h &s;hips along the coa&s;t of Chili, Peru, Nueva E&s;panna, and Nueva Galicia, and that they had taken many &s;hips and merchandize in them, and burnt di|vers towns, and &s;poiled all that ever they could come unto; and that they had taken the king's &s;hip which came from Manilla, and all his trea|&s;ure, and all the merchandize that was therein, and had &s;et all the people on &s;hore, taking him|&s;elf away by force; therefore he willed them that they &s;hould make &s;trong their bulwarks, with their two galleys, and all &s;uch provi&s;ion as they could po&s;&s;ibly make. He further &s;ignified, that we were riding at an i&s;land called Capul, which was at the end of the i&s;land of Manilla; being but one &s;hip with &s;mall force in it; and that the other &s;hip, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, was gone for the north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, &s;tanding in fifty-five degrees; and that, if they could u&s;e any means to &s;urprize us, being there at anchor, they &s;hould di&s;patch it, for our force was but &s;mall, and our men but weak; and that the place where we rode was but fifty leagues from them: otherwi&s;e, if they let us e&s;cape, within a few years they mu&s;t make account to have their
<PB N="216" REF="289">
town be&s;ieged and &s;acked by an army of Eng|li&s;h. This information being given, our Gene|ral called for him, and charged him with the&s;e things, which, at the fir&s;t, he utterly de|nied; but, in the end, the matter being made manife&s;t and known of certainty by &s;pe|cial trial and proofs, the next morning, our Ge|neral gave orders that he &s;hould be hanged, which was accordingly performed the 16th of January.</P>
<P>We rode for the &s;pace of nine days about this i&s;land of Capul, where we had divers kinds of fre&s;h victuals, with excellent fre&s;h water in every bay, and great plenty of wood. The people of this i&s;land go almo&s;t naked, and are of a tawny colour. The men wear only a girdle about their wai&s;ts, of a kind of linnen of their own weaving, which is made of plantain leaves, and an apron, which, coming from their back and covering their nakedne&s;s, is made fa&s;t to their girdles at their navels.</P>
<P>The&s;e people u&s;e a &s;trange kind of order among them, which is this: every man and man-child among them hath a little peg-nail thru&s;t through the head of his privy parts, being &s;plit in the lower end, and rivetted, and on the head of the nail is as it were a crown; which they take out and in as they have occa&s;ion: and for the truth thereof we our&s;elves have taken one of the&s;e nails from a &s;on of one or their kings, who was of the age of ten years.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="290">On the 23d of January, our General, Mr. Thomas Cavendi&s;h, cau&s;ed all the chiefs of this i&s;land and of an hundred i&s;lands more, whom he had made to pay tribute to him, which tribute was in hogs, hens, potatoes and cocoas, to appear before him, and made him&s;elf and his company known unto them, that they were Eng|li&s;hmen, and enemies to the Spaniards; and thereupon &s;pread his en&s;ign, &s;ounded his trum|pets, and beat his drums; which they much wondered at. To conclude, they promi&s;ed both them&s;elves and all the i&s;lands thereabout, to aid him when&s;oever he &s;hould come again to overcome the Spaniards. Al&s;o our General gave them, in token that we were enemies to the Spaniards, money back again for all their tri|bute which they had paid, which they took very friendly, and rowed about our &s;hip to give us plea&s;ure. At la&s;t our General ordered a &s;acre to be &s;hot off, whereat they wondered, and, with great contentment, took their leave of us.</P>
<P>The next day, being the 26th of January, we &s;et &s;ail, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and ran along the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Manilla, &s;haping our cour&s;e north we&s;t, between Manilla and the i&s;le of Ma&s;bat.</P>
<P>The 28th in the morning, about &s;even o'clock, riding at an anchor between two i&s;lands, we &s;pied a frigate under her cour&s;es, coming out between two other i&s;lands, which, as we imagined, came from Manilla, &s;ailing clo&s;e by the &s;hore along the main i&s;land of Panama. We chaced this fri|gate along the &s;hore, and gained fa&s;t upon her,
<PB N="218" REF="291">
until in the end we came &s;o near that &s;he &s;tood in for the &s;hore, clo&s;e by a wind, and being be|calmed, banked up with her oars; whereupon we came to an anchor with our &s;hip a league and a half from the place where the frigate rowed in, and manned our boat with half a dozen &s;hot, and as many men with &s;words, who did row the boat. Thus we made after the fri|gate, which had run into a river where we could not reach her; but as we rowed along the &s;hore, our boat came into very &s;hallow water, where many marks were &s;et up in divers places in the &s;ea, from whence two or three canoes came forth, whereof one made &s;omewhat near unto us with three or four Indians in it. We called unto them, but they would not come nearer unto us, but rowed from us, whom we dur&s;t not follow too far, for fear of bringing our&s;elves too much to the leeward of our &s;hip. Here, as we looked about us, we &s;pied another bal&s;a or canoe of a great bigne&s;s, which they who were in her did &s;et along, as we u&s;ually &s;et a barge, with long &s;taves or poles, which was builded up with great canes, and below near the water made to row with oars, wherein were about five or &s;ix Indians and one Spaniard. Now, as we were come almo&s;t at the bal&s;a, we ran a-ground with our boat, but one or two of our men leapt over|board and freed it again pre&s;ently, and keeping thwart her head, we laid her aboard, and took into us the Spaniard, but the Indians leaped into the &s;ea, and dived and ro&s;e again far off from us. Pre&s;ently, upon the taking of this canoe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">e
<PB N="219" REF="292">
appeared upon the &s;ands a band of &s;oldiers, marching with an en&s;ign having a red cro&s;s like the flag of England, who were about fifty or &s;ixty Spaniards, lately come from Manilla to that town, which is called Reguan, in a bark to fetch a new &s;hip of the king's, which was building in a river within the bay, and &s;taid there only for certain irons to &s;erve for the rudder of the &s;aid &s;hip, which they looked for every day.</P>
<P>This band of men &s;hot at us from the &s;hore with their mu&s;quets, but hit none of us, and we &s;hot at them again. They al&s;o manned a frigate, and &s;ent it out after our boat to have taken us, but we with our oars went from them; and whether they perceived they could not overtake us, but that they mu&s;t come with|in danger of the ordnance of our &s;hip, they &s;tood in with the &s;hore again, and landed their men; and pre&s;ently &s;ent their frigate about the point, but whither we knew not: &s;o we came on board with this one Spaniard, who was neither &s;oldier nor &s;ailor, but one who was come among the re&s;t from Manilla, and had been in the ho&s;|pital there a long time before, and was a very &s;imple fellow, and &s;uch a one as could an&s;wer to very little that was enquired of him con|cerning the &s;tate of the country. Here we rode at anchor all that night, and perceived that the Spaniards had di&s;per&s;ed their band into two or three parties, and kept great watch in &s;everal places with fires and &s;hooting off of their pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="293">This i&s;land hath much plain ground in it in many places, and many fair and &s;traight trees grow upon it, fit to make excellent ma&s;ts for all &s;orts of &s;hips. There are al&s;o mines of very fine gold in it, which are in the cu&s;tody of the In|dians. And, to the &s;outhward of this place, there is another very great i&s;land, which is not &s;ubdued by the Spaniards, nor any other nation. The people who inhabit it are all negroes; and the i&s;land is called the I&s;land of Negroes. It is almo&s;t as big as England, &s;tanding in nine de|grees. The mo&s;t part of it &s;eemeth to be very low land, and, by all likelihood, is very fruitful.</P>
<P>The 29th day of January, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we &s;et &s;ail, &s;ending our boat be|fore, until it was two o'clock in the afternoon, pa&s;&s;ing all this time as it were through a &s;trait, betwixt the &s;aid two i&s;lands of Panama and the i&s;land of Negroes; and, about 16 leagues off, we e&s;pied a fair opening, trending &s;outh-we&s;t and by &s;outh; at which time our boat came on board, and our General &s;ent commendations to the Spani&s;h Captain, whom we came from the evening before, by the Spaniard we had taken, and de&s;ired him to provide good &s;tore of gold, for he intended to &s;ee him with his com|pany at Manilla within a few years, and that he did but want a bigger boat to have landed his men, or el&s;e he would have &s;een him then; and &s;o cau&s;ed him to be &s;et on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The 8th day of February, by eight o'clock in the morning, we e&s;pied an i&s;land near Gilolo,
<PB N="221" REF="294">
called Batochina, which &s;tandeth in one degree from the Equinoctial Line, northward.</P>
<P>The 14th day of February, we fell in with eleven or twelve very &s;mall i&s;lands, lying very low and flat, full of trees; and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome i&s;lands which are &s;unk, and have the dry &s;ands lying in the main &s;ea. The&s;e i&s;lands, near the Moluccas, &s;tand in three degrees ten minutes to the &s;outhward of the Line.</P>
<P>On the 17th day, one John Gameford, a coo|per, died, who had been &s;ick of an old di&s;ea&s;e a long time.</P>
<P>The 20th day, we fell in with certain other i&s;lands, which had many &s;mall i&s;lands among them, &s;tanding four degrees to the &s;outhward of the Line.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t day of February, being A&s;h-Wed|ne&s;day, Captain Havers died of a mo&s;t violent and pe&s;tilent ague, which held him furiou&s;ly for &s;even or eight days, to the no &s;mall grief of our General, and of all the re&s;t of the company, who cau&s;ed two falcons and one &s;acre to be &s;hot off, with all the &s;mall &s;hot in the &s;hip; who, after he was &s;hrouded in a &s;heet, was thrown over-board, with great lamentation of us all. Moreover, pre&s;ently after his death, my&s;elf, with divers others in the &s;hip, fell very &s;ick, and &s;o continued in very great pain for the &s;pace of three weeks, or a month, by rea&s;on of the ex|treme heat and intemperatene&s;s of the climate.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t day of March, having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits of Java Minor and Java Major, we
<PB N="222" REF="295">
came to an anchor, under the &s;outh-we&s;t parts of Java Major; where we e&s;pied certain of the inhabitants, who were fi&s;hing by the &s;ea-&s;ide in a bay which was under the i&s;land. Then our General taking into the &s;hip-boat certain of his company, and a negroe who could &s;peak the Mori&s;co tongue, whom he had, taken out of the Santa Anna, made towards tho&s;e fi&s;hers; who, having e&s;pied our boat, ran on &s;hore into the woods, for fear of our men. But our General cau&s;ed his negroe to call unto them; who had no &s;ooner heard him call, than pre&s;ently one of them came to the &s;hore &s;ide, and made an&s;wer. Our General, by the negroe, enquired of him for fre&s;h water; which they found; and cau&s;ed the fi&s;her to go to the King, and to acquaint him of a &s;hip that was come to have traffic for victuals, and for diamonds, pearls, or any other rich jewels that he had; for which, he &s;hould have either gold, or other merchandize in ex|change. The fi&s;her an&s;wered, that we &s;hould have all manner of victuals that we would re|que&s;t. Thus our boat came on board again. Within a while after, we went about to furni&s;h our &s;hip thoroughly with wood and water.</P>
<P>About the 8th of March, two or three canoes came from the town unto us, with eggs, hens, fre&s;h fi&s;h, oranges, and limes, and brought word we &s;hould have had victuals more plentifully, but that they were &s;o far to be brought to us where we rode. Which when our General heard, he weighed anchor, and &s;tood in nearer
<PB N="223" REF="296">
for the town; and, as we were under &s;ail, we met with one of the King's canoes coming to|wards us: whereupon we dropt &s;ome of our &s;ails, and &s;taid for the canoe until it came aboard us, then &s;tood into the bay, which was hard by, and came to an anchor. In this canoe was the King's Secretary, who had on his head a piece of died linen, folded up like unto a Turki&s;h turban. He was all naked, except about his wai&s;t; his brea&s;t was carved with the broad arrow upon it; he went bare-footed. He had an interpreter with him, who was a Me&s;tizo, that is, half an Indian and half a Portugue&s;e, who could &s;peak very good Portugue&s;e. This Secretary &s;ignified unto our General, that he had brought him an hog, hens, eggs, fre&s;h fi&s;h, &s;ugar-canes, and wine, which wine was as &s;trong as aqua-vitae, and as clear as any rock-water. He told him farther, that he would bring victuals &s;o &s;ufficiently for him as he and his company would reque&s;t, and that within the &s;pace of four days. Our General u&s;ed him &s;ingularly well, banquetted him mo&s;t royally with the choice of many and &s;undry con&s;erves, wines both &s;weet and otherwi&s;e; and cau&s;ed his mu&s;icians to make him mu&s;ic. This done, our General told him, that he and his company were Engli&s;hmen; that we had been at China, and had trafficked in that country; that we were come thither to make enquiries, and purpo&s;ed to go to Molucca. The people told our General, that there were certain Portugue&s;e in the i&s;land, who &s;taid there as fac|tors
<PB N="224" REF="297">
continually, to traffic with them, to buy negroes, cloves, pepper, &s;ugar, and many other commodities. This Secretary of the King, with his interpreter, lay one night on board our &s;hip. The &s;ame night, becau&s;e they lay on board, in the evening at the &s;etting of the watch, our Ge|neral commanded every man in the &s;hip to pro|vide his harquebu&s;s, and his &s;hot; and &s;o with &s;hooting off forty or fifty &s;mall &s;hot, and a &s;acre, him&s;elf &s;et the watch. This was no &s;mall won|der to the&s;e heathen people, who had not com|monly &s;een any &s;hip &s;o furni&s;hed with men and ordnance. The next morning we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Secretary and his interpreter, with all humanity.</P>
<P>The fourth day after, which was the 12th of March, according to their appointment, came the King's canoes: but the wind being &s;ome|what &s;cant, they could not get on board that night, but put into a bay under the i&s;land until the next day; and, pre&s;ently after the break of day, there came to the number of nine or ten of the King's canoes, &s;o deeply laden with provi|&s;ions as they could &s;wim, with two live oxen, half a &s;core of large fat hogs, a number of live hens, ducks, and gee&s;e, with eggs, plantains, &s;ugar-canes, &s;ugar in plates, cocoas, &s;weet oranges, and bitter limes, great &s;tore of wine and aqua-vitae, &s;alt to &s;ea&s;on meat with, and almo&s;t all manner of provi&s;ions be&s;ides, accompanied with divers of the King's officers who were there. Among all the re&s;t of the people, in one of the&s;e canoes, came two Portugue&s;e, who were men of
<PB N="225" REF="298">
middle &s;tature, and very proper per&s;onage: they were each of them in a loo&s;e jerkin and ho&s;e, which came down from the wai&s;t to the ancle, according to the fa&s;hion of the country, and partly becau&s;e it was Lent, and a time for doing of their penance. They account it as a thing of great di&s;honour among the&s;e heathens, to wear either ho&s;e or &s;hoes on their feet. The Portu|gue&s;e had on each of them a very fair and a white lawn &s;hirt, with falling bands on the &s;ame, very decent, their bare legs excepted. The&s;e Portu|gue&s;e were no &s;mall joy unto our General, and all the re&s;t of our company; for we had not &s;een any Chri&s;tian that was our friend for a year and an half before. Our General u&s;ed and treated them &s;ingularly well with banquets and mu&s;ic. They told us, that they were no le&s;s glad to &s;ee us than we were to &s;ee them, and enquired into the e&s;tate of their country, and what was become of Don Antonio, their King, and whether he were living or not; for that they had not been in Portugal for a long time, and that the Spa|niards had always brought them word that he was dead? Then our General &s;atisfied them in every demand, a&s;&s;uring them that their King was alive and in England, and had honourable allowance from our Queen; and that there was war betwixt Spain and England, and that we were come under the King of Portugal into the South Sea, and had warred upon the Spaniards there, and had fired, &s;poiled, and &s;unk all the &s;hips along the coa&s;t that we could meet with,
<PB N="226" REF="299">
to the number of eighteen or twenty &s;ail. With this report they were abundantly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, they declared unto us the &s;tate of the i&s;land of Java: Fir&s;t, the plentiful|ne&s;s, great choice, and &s;tore of provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, and of all manner of fruits, as before &s;et down; then the great and rich merchanchizes which are there to be had. Then they de&s;cribed the nature and properties of the people, as fol|loweth: The name of the King of that part of the i&s;land was Raya Bolamboam, who was a man had in great maje&s;ty and fear among them. The common people may not bargain, &s;ell, or ex|change any thing with any other nation, without &s;pecial licence from their King; and, if any &s;o do, it is pre&s;ent death for him. The King him|&s;elf is a man of great years, and hath an hundred wives; his &s;on hath fifty. The cu&s;tom of the country is, that, when&s;oever the King doth die, they take the dead body and burn it, and pre|&s;erve the a&s;hes of him; and, within five days next after, the wives of the &s;aid King &s;o dead, according to the cu&s;tom and u&s;e of their coun|try, every one of them go together to a place appointed; and, the chief of the women, who was neare&s;t to him in account, hath a ball in her hand, and throweth it from her; and to the place where the ball re&s;teth, thither they go all, and turn their faces to the ea&s;tward, and every one, with a dagger in her hand (which dagger they call a cri&s;e, and is as &s;harp as a razor,) &s;tab them|&s;elves to the heart, and, with their own hands,

<FIGURE>
<PB REF="300">
<HEAD>The KING of JAVA's Wives destroying themselves at his Death.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="227" REF="301">
bathe them&s;elves in their blood, and falling flat on their faces, &s;o end their days. This thing is as true as it may &s;eem to any hearer to be &s;trange.</P>
<P>The men of them&s;elves are very politic and &s;ubtle, and &s;ingularly valiant (being naked men) in any action they undertake, and very &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive and obedient to their king: for example, if their king command them to undertake any exploit, be it ever &s;o dangerous or de&s;perate, they dare not nor will not refu&s;e, though they &s;hould die every man of them in executing the &s;ame; for he will cut off the heads of every one of them who return alive, without bring|ing their purpo&s;e to pa&s;s; which is &s;uch a thing among&s;t them, as maketh them the mo&s;t valiant people in all the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of the world; for they never fear any death; for being in fight with any nation, if any of them feeleth him&s;elf hurt with lance or &s;word, he will willingly run him&s;elf upon the weapon quite through the body to procure his death the more &s;peedily, and in this de&s;perate manner end his days, or overcome his enemy. Moreover, although the men be tawny of colour, and go continually naked, yet their women are fair of complexion, and go more apparelled.</P>
<P>After they had thus de&s;cribed the &s;tate of the i&s;land, and the order and fa&s;hion of the people, they told us further, that, if their king, Don Antonio, would come unto them, they would warrant him to have all the Moluccas at com|mand,
<PB N="228" REF="302">
be&s;ides China-Sanglos and the i&s;les of the Philippines; and that he might be a&s;&s;ured to have all the Indians on his &s;ide that were in the country. After we had fully contented the&s;e Portugue&s;e, and the people of Java who had brought us provi&s;ions in their canoes, they took their leave of us with promi&s;e of all good enter|tainment at our return; and our General gave them three great pieces of ordnance at their departing.</P>
<P>Thus, the next day, being the 16th of March, we &s;et &s;ail towards the Cape of Good Hope, called by the Portugue&s;e Cabo de Buena E&s;|peranca, on the mo&s;t &s;outhern coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of March, and all the month of April, we &s;pent in traver&s;ing that mighty and va&s;t &s;ea, between the i&s;land of Java and the main of Africa, ob&s;erving the heavens, the Cro&s;iers, or the South-pole, the other &s;tars, the fowls which are marks unto &s;eamen of fair weather and foul weather, approaching of lands or i&s;lands, the winds, the tempe&s;ts, the rains and thunder, with the alterations of tides and currents.</P>
<P>The 10th day of May, we had a &s;torm from the we&s;t, and it blew &s;o hard, that it was as much as the &s;hip could &s;teer clo&s;e by under the wind; and the &s;torm continued all that day and all that night.</P>
<P>The next day, being the 11th of May, in the morning, one of the company went up to the
<PB N="229" REF="303">
top, and e&s;pied land bearing north and north-by-we&s;t of us; and about noon we e&s;pied land to bear we&s;t of us, which we imagined to be the Cape of Buena E&s;peranca, whereof indeed we were &s;hort about forty, or fifty leagues; and, by rea&s;on of the &s;cantne&s;s of the wind, we &s;tood along to the &s;outh-ea&s;t until midnight, at which time the wind came fair, and we hauled along we&s;tward.</P>
<P>The 12th and 13th days we were becalmed, and the &s;ky was very hazy and thick until the 14th day at three o'clock in the afternoon, at which time the &s;ky cleared, and we &s;pied land again, which was that called Cabo Fal&s;o, which is &s;hort of Cabo de Buena E&s;peranca forty or fifty leagues.</P>
<P>This cape is very ea&s;y to be known, for there are right over it three very high hills, &s;tanding but a &s;mall way one off another, and the highe&s;t &s;tandeth in the mid&s;t, and the ground is much lower by the &s;ea-&s;ide. The Cape of Good Hope beareth we&s;t and by-&s;outh from the &s;aid Cabo Fal&s;o.</P>
<P>The 16th day of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the wind came up at ea&s;t a very bri&s;k gale, which continued till Saturday, with as much wind as ever the &s;hip could go be|fore. At which time, by &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we e&s;pied the promontory or head|land called the Cabo de Buena E&s;peranca, which is a pretty high-land; and at the we&s;ternmo&s;t point, a little off the main, appear two hum|mocks,
<PB N="230" REF="304">
the one upon the other, and three other hummocks, lying further off into the &s;ea, yet low-land between and adjoining unto the &s;ea.</P>
<P>This Cape of Buena E&s;peranca is &s;et down and accounted 2000 leagues from the i&s;land of Java in the Portugue&s;e &s;ea charts, but it is not &s;o much by almo&s;t 150 leagues, as we found by the running of our &s;hip. We were in running of the&s;e 1850 leagues ju&s;t nine weeks.</P>
<P>The 8th day of June, by break of day, we fell in &s;ight of the i&s;land of St. Helena, &s;even or eight leagues &s;hort of it, having but a &s;mall gale of wind, or almo&s;t none at all, in&s;omuch as we could not get into it that day, but &s;tood off and on all that night.</P>
<P>The next day, being the ninth of June, hav|ing a pretty ea&s;y gale of wind, we &s;tood in with the &s;hore, our boat being &s;ent away before to make the harbour; and, about one o'clock in the afternoon, we came to an anchor in twelve fathoms water, two or three cables length from the &s;hore, in a very fair and &s;mooth bay under the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is very high land, and lieth in the main &s;ea; &s;tanding, as it were, in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, between the main land of Africa, the main of Brazilia, and the coa&s;t of Guinea; and is in fifteen degrees forty-eight minutes to the &s;outhward of the Equinoctial Line, and is di&s;|tant from the Cape of Buena E&s;peranca between five and &s;ix hundred leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="305">The &s;ame day, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, we went on &s;hore, where we found an exceeding fair and plea&s;ant valley, wherein divers hand&s;ome buildings and hou&s;es were &s;et up; and one particularly, which was a church, was tiled and whitened on the out&s;ide very fair, and made with a porch; and within the church, at the upper end, was &s;et an altar, whereon &s;tood a very large table, &s;et in a frame, having in it the picture of our Saviour Chri&s;t upon the cro&s;s, and the image of our Lady praying, with divers other hi&s;tories curiou&s;ly painted in the &s;ame. The &s;ides of the church were hung round with &s;tained cloths, having many devices drawn on them.</P>
<P>There are two hou&s;es adjoining to the church, on each &s;ide one, which &s;erve for kitchens to dre&s;s meat in, with nece&s;&s;ary rooms and hou&s;es of office. The coverings of the &s;aid hou&s;es are made flat, where is planted a very fair vine, and through both the &s;aid hou&s;es runneth a very good and whole&s;ome &s;tream of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o over again&s;t the church a very fair cau&s;eway, made up with &s;tones reaching unto a valley by the &s;ea-&s;ide, in which valley is plant|ed a garden, wherein grow great &s;tore of pom|pions and melons; and upon the &s;aid cau&s;eway is a frame erected, whereon hang two bells, wherewith they ring to ma&s;s; and near to it a cro&s;s is &s;et up, which is &s;quared, framed, and made very artificially of free-&s;tone, whereon is
<PB N="232" REF="306">
carved in cyphers what time it was built, which was in the year of our Lord 1571.</P>
<P>This valley is the faire&s;t and large&s;t low plot in all the i&s;land, and is exceeding &s;weet and plea|&s;ant, and planted in every place, either with fruit or with herbs.</P>
<P>There are fig-trees which bear fruit continual|ly and very plentifully; for on every tree you may &s;ee blo&s;&s;oms, green figs, and ripe figs all at once, and it is &s;o all the year long. The rea|&s;on is, that the i&s;land &s;tandeth &s;o near the &s;un. There is al&s;o great &s;tore of lemon-trees, orange-trees, pomegranate trees, pomecitron-trees, and date-trees, which bear fruit as the fig-trees do, and are planted carefully and very artificially, with plea&s;ant walks under and between them; and the &s;aid walks are over&s;hadowed with the leaves of the trees; and in every void place is planted par&s;ley, &s;orrel, ba&s;il, fennel, anni&s;eed, mu&s;tard-&s;eed, radi&s;hes, and many very good herbs. The fre&s;h-water brook runneth through divers places in this orchard, and may, with very &s;mall pains, be made to water any one tree in the valley.</P>
<P>This fre&s;h water &s;tream cometh from the tops of the mountains, and falleth from the cliff in|to the valley the height of a cable; and hath many arms i&s;&s;uing out of it, that refre&s;h the whole i&s;land, and almo&s;t every tree in it. The i&s;land is altogether high mountains and &s;teep vallies, except it be on the tops of &s;ome hills, and down below in &s;ome of the vallies, where great plenty
<PB N="233" REF="307">
of all tho&s;e fruits before &s;poken of do grow. There are much more growing on the tops of the mountains than below in the vallies; but it is very toil&s;ome and dangerous travelling up unto them and down again, by rea&s;on of the height and &s;teepne&s;s of the hills.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o upon this i&s;land great &s;tore of partridges, which are very tame, not making any great ha&s;te to fly away, though one come very near them, but only to run away and get up into the &s;teep cliffs; we killed &s;ome of them with a fowling-piece; they differ very much from our partridges which are in England both in bigne&s;s and al&s;o in colour, for they are almo&s;t as big as hens, and are of an a&s;h colour, and live in covies, twelve, &s;ixteen, and twenty to|gether; you cannot go ten or twelve &s;core paces but you &s;hall &s;ee or &s;pring one or two covies at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e no le&s;s plenty of phea&s;ants in the i&s;land, which are al&s;o very big and fat, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e which are in our country in big|ne&s;s and in numbers in a company; they differ not very much in colour from the partridges before &s;poken of. We found, moreover, on this i&s;land, plenty of Guinea-cocks, which we call turkies, of colour black and white, with red heads; they are much the &s;ame in bigne&s;s with ours in England; their eggs are white, and as big as a turkey's egg.</P>
<P>There are in this i&s;land thou&s;ands of goats, which the Spaniards call cabritos, which are very
<PB N="234" REF="308">
wild; you &s;hall &s;ee one or two hundred of them together, and &s;ometimes you may &s;ee them go in a flock almo&s;t a mile long; &s;ome of them (whether it be the nature of the breed of them or of the country I know not) are as big as an a&s;s, with a mane like a hor&s;e, and a beard hang|ing down to the very ground; they will climb up the cliffs, which are &s;o &s;teep that a man would think it a thing impo&s;&s;ible that any living creature could go there. We took and killed many of them for all their &s;wiftne&s;s, for there are thou&s;ands of them upon the mountains.</P>
<P>Here are in like manner great &s;tore of &s;wine, which are very wild and fat, and of great big|ne&s;s; they keep altogether upon the mountains, and will very &s;eldom abide any man to come near them, except it be by mere chance, when they are found a&s;leep, or otherwi&s;e, according to their kind, are taken lying in the mire.</P>
<P>We found in the hou&s;es, at our coming, three &s;laves who were negroes, and one who was born in the i&s;land of Java, who told us, that the Ea&s;t-Indian fleet, which were in number five &s;ail, the lea&s;t whereof was in burden eight or nine hundred tons, all laden with &s;pices and Ca|licut cloth, with &s;tore of trea&s;ure, and very rich &s;tones and pearls were gone from the &s;aid i&s;land, St. Helena, but twenty days before we came thither.</P>
<P>This i&s;land hath been found long ago by the Portugue&s;e, and hath been altogether planted by them for their refre&s;hment, as they come
<PB N="235" REF="309">
from the Ea&s;t-Indies; and, when they come, they have all things in plenty for their relief, by rea&s;on that they &s;uffer none to inhabit there, that might eat up the produce of the i&s;land, ex|cept &s;ome very few &s;ick per&s;ons of their com|pany, whom they &s;u&s;pect will not live until they come home; the&s;e they leave there to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and take them away the year follow|ing, with the other fleet, if they live &s;o long. They touch here rather in their coming home from the Ea&s;t Indies, than at their going thither, becau&s;e they are thoroughly furni&s;hed with corn when they &s;et out of Portugal; but are meanly victualled at their coming from the Indies, where there groweth but little corn.</P>
<P>The 20th day of June, having taken in wood and water, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves with &s;uch things as we found there, and made clean our &s;hip, we &s;et &s;ail about eight o'clock at night to|wards England. At our &s;etting &s;ail we had the wind at &s;outh ea&s;t, and we hauled north-we&s;t and by-we&s;t. The wind is commonly off the &s;hore at this i&s;land of St. Helena.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 3d day of July, we went away north-we&s;t, the wind being &s;till at &s;outh-ea&s;t; at which time we were in one degree and forty-eight minutes to the &s;outhward of the Equinoctial Line.</P>
<P>The 12th day of the &s;aid month of July there was very little wind; and, towards night, it was calm, and blew no wind at all, and &s;o continued till Monday, being the 15th day of July.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="310">On Wedne&s;day the 17th day of the &s;aid month, we had a &s;mall gale at we&s;t-north-we&s;t. We found the wind continually to blow at ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t, and ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, after we were in three or four degrees to the northward; and it altered not until we came between thirty and forty degrees to the northward of the Equi|noctial Line.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 21&s;t day of Augu&s;t, the wind came up at &s;outh-we&s;t a fair gale; by which day at noon we were in thirty-eight degrees of north latitude.</P>
<P>On Friday, in the morning, being the 23d of Augu&s;t, at four o'clock we hauled ea&s;t and ea&s;t-by-&s;outh, for the mo&s;t northern i&s;lands of the Azores.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 24th day of the &s;aid month, by five o'clock in the morning, we fell in &s;ight of the two i&s;lands of Flores and Cervo, &s;tand|ing thirty nine degrees thirty minutes; and &s;ail|ed away north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The 3d of September, we met with a Flemi&s;h hulk that came from Li&s;bon, and declared unto us the overthrowing of the Spani&s;h fleet, to the &s;ingular rejoicing and comfort of us all.</P>
<P>The 9th of September, after a terrible tem|pe&s;t, which carried away mo&s;t part of our &s;ails, by the merciful favour of the Almighty, we re|covered our long-wi&s;hed-for port of Plymouth, in England, from whence we &s;et forth at the beginning of our voyage."</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="311">[The wealth acquired in this voyage, though very con&s;iderable, was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated; and, in le&s;s than three years, Cavendi&s;h again found him|&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for a &s;econd, in which, however, he was very unfortunate. He had, indeed, increa&s;ed his preparations; and, it is not to be doubted, but that the certainty he had conceived of acquiring a more ample for|tune by a &s;econd enterprize, made him the more carele&s;s in the management of the trea&s;ure he had acquired by the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;hips fitted out on this occa&s;ion were the Leice&s;ter, commanded by him&s;elf as Admiral; the Roebuck, Captain Cocke, Vice-Admiral; the De&s;ire, Captain Davis, Rear-Admiral; the Dainty, Captain Coffen; and the Black Pinnace, who&s;e Commander's name is not mentioned.

<P>"The 26th of Aug. 1591, we departed from Plymouth, &s;ays Mr. Jane, with three large &s;hips and two barks.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="312">The 29th of November, we fell in with the bay of Salvador, upon the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, twelve leagues on this &s;ide Cape Frio, where we were becalmed until the 2d of December: at which time we took a &s;mall bark bound for the river of Plate, with &s;ugar, haberda&s;h-wares, and ne|groes. The ma&s;ter of this bark brought us to an i&s;le called Placentia, thirty leagues we&s;t from Cape Frio, where we arrived the 5th of Decem|ber, and rifled &s;ix or &s;even hou&s;es inhabited by the Portugue&s;e. The 11th, we departed from this place, and, the 14th, arrived at the i&s;land of St. Seba&s;tian; from whence Mr. Cocke and Captain Davis pre&s;ently departed with the De|&s;ire and Black Pinnace, for taking the town of Santos. The 16th, at evening, we anchored at the bar of Santos, from whence we departed, with our boats, to the town; by which expedi|tion, we took all the people at ma&s;s, both men and women, whom we kept all that day in the church a pri&s;oners. The cau&s;e why Mr Ca|vendi&s;h de&s;ired to take this town, was to &s;upply his great wants; and, having it now in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we &s;tood in a&s;&s;urance of having pro|vi&s;ions in great abundance. But &s;uch was the negligence of Captain Cocke, that the Indians were &s;uffered to carry out what&s;oever they would in open view, and no man did controul them: and the next day, after we had won the town, our pri&s;oners were all &s;et at liberty; only four poor old men were kept as pledges to &s;upply our wants. Thus, in three days, the town, which
<PB N="239" REF="313">
was able to furni&s;h &s;uch another fleet with all kinds of nece&s;&s;aries, was left unto us nakedly bare, without people and provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Eight or ten days after, Mr. Cavendi&s;h him&s;elf came hither, where he remained until the 22d of January, &s;eeking by entreaty to have that whereof we were once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But, in con|clu&s;ion, we departed wor&s;e furni&s;hed from the town, than when we came unto it. The 22d, we burnt St. Vincent's to the ground. The 24th, we &s;et &s;ail, &s;haping our cour&s;e for the &s;traits of Magellan.</P>
<P>The 7th of February, we had a very great &s;torm; and, the 8th, our fleet was &s;eparated by the fury of the tempe&s;t. Then our Captain called unto him the ma&s;ter of our &s;hip, a very hone&s;t and &s;ufficient man; and, conferring with him, he concluded to go for Port De&s;ire, hoping that the General would come thither, becau&s;e that in his fir&s;t voyage he had found great relief there; for our Captain could never get any di|rection what cour&s;e to take in any &s;uch extre|mities, though many times he had entreated for it, as often I have heard him with grief re|port. In &s;ailing to this port, by good chance, we met with the Roebuck, wherein Mr. Cocke had endured great extremities, and lo&s;t his boat, and therefore de&s;ired our Captain to keep him company, for he was in a very de&s;perate &s;ituation. Our Captain hoi&s;ted out his boat, and went on board him to know his e&s;tate, and, returning, told us the hardne&s;s thereof, and de&s;ired the
<PB N="240" REF="314">
Ma&s;ter and all the company to be careful in all their watches not to lo&s;e the Roebuck, and &s;o we both arrived at Port De&s;ire the &s;ixth of March.</P>
<P>The 16th of March, the Black Pinnace came to us; but the Dainty came not, but returned back to England, leaving their Captain on board the Roebuck, without any provi&s;ion more than the apparel that he wore. The 18th the Lei|ce&s;ter came into the road, and Mr. Cavendi&s;h came into the harbour in a boat which he had made at &s;ea; for his long boat and pinnace were lo&s;t at &s;ea: and being on board the De&s;ire, he told our Captain of all his extremities, and &s;poke mo&s;t hardly of his company, and of di|vers gentlemen that were with him, purpo&s;ing no more to go on board his own &s;hip, but to &s;tay in the De&s;ire. We all &s;orrowed to hear &s;uch hard &s;peeches of our good friends; but having &s;poken with the gentlemen of the Lei|ce&s;ter, we found them faithful, hone&s;t, and re|&s;olute in proceeding, although it plea&s;ed our General otherwi&s;e to conceive of them.</P>
<P>The 20th of March, we departed from Port De&s;ire, Mr. Cavendi&s;h being in the De&s;ire with us. The 8th of April, we fell in with the &s;traits of Magellan, enduring many furious &s;torms between Port De&s;ire and the &s;trait. The 14th, we pa&s;&s;ed through the fir&s;t &s;trait. The 16th, we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd &s;trait, being ten leagues di&s;tant from the fir&s;t. The 18th, we doubled Cape Froward, which cape lieth in 53 degrees 30 minutes.
<PB N="241" REF="315">
The 21&s;t we were forced, through the fury of the weather, to put into a &s;mall cove with our &s;hips, four leagues from the &s;aid cape, upon the &s;outh &s;hore, where we remained until the 15th of May, in the which time we endured ex|treme &s;torms, with perpetual &s;now, where ma|ny of our men died with cur&s;ed famine, and mi&s;erable cold, not having wherewith to cover their bodies, nor to fill their bellies, but living by mu&s;cles, water, and weeds of the &s;ea, with a &s;mall relief, from the &s;hip's &s;tore, in meal, &s;ometimes. And all the &s;ick men in the Lei|ce&s;ter were mo&s;t uncharitably put on &s;hore into the woods, in the &s;now, rain, and cold, when men of good health could &s;carcely endure it, where they ended their lives in the highe&s;t de|gree of mi&s;ery. Mr. Cavendi&s;h all the while being on board the De&s;ire. In the&s;e great extre|mities of &s;now and cold, doubting what the end would be, he a&s;ked our captain's opinion, be|cau&s;e he was a man that had good experience of the north-we&s;t parts, in his three &s;everal di&s;|coveries that way, employed by the merchants of London. Our captain told him, that this &s;now was a matter of no long continuance, and gave him &s;ufficient rea&s;on for it, and that there|by he could not much be prejudiced or hindered in his proceeding. Notwith&s;tanding, he called together all the company, and told them, that he purpo&s;ed not to &s;tay in the &s;traits, but to de|part upon &s;ome other voyage, or el&s;e to return again for Brazil: but his re&s;olution was to go
<PB N="242" REF="316">
for the Cape of Good Hope. The company an&s;wered, that, if it plea&s;ed him, they did de&s;ire to &s;tay God's favour for a wind, and to endure all hardne&s;s what&s;oever, rather than to give over the voyage, con&s;idering they had been here but a &s;mall time, and becau&s;e they were within for|ty leagues of the South Sea, it grieved them now to return: notwith&s;tanding, whatever he ordered, that they would perform. So he con|cluded to go for the Cape of Good Hope, and to give over this voyage. Then our captain, after Mr. Cavendi&s;h was come on board the De&s;ire from talking with the company, told him, that, if it plea&s;ed him to con&s;ider the great extremity of his &s;ituation, the &s;lenderne&s;s of his provi&s;ions, with the weakne&s;s of his men, it was no cour&s;e for him to proceed in that new enterprize: for if the re&s;t of your &s;hips (&s;aid he) be furni&s;hed an&s;werable to this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to perform your determination; for we have no more &s;ails than ma&s;ts, no victuals, no ground-tackling, no cordage more than is over-head, and, among &s;eventy-five per&s;ons, there is but the ma&s;ter alone that can order the &s;hip, and but fourteen &s;ailors: the re&s;t are gentlemen, &s;erving-men, and artificers. Therefore it will be a de&s;|perate ca&s;e to take &s;o hard an enterprize in hand. The&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions did our captain not only u&s;e to Mr. Cavendi&s;h, but al&s;o to Mr. Cocke. In fine, upon a petition delivered in writing by the chief of the whole company, the General determined to depart out of the &s;traits of Ma|gellan,
<PB N="243" REF="317">
and to return again for Santos in Bra|zil.</P>
<P>So the 15th of May, we &s;et &s;ail, our General being then in the Leice&s;ter. The 18th, we were free of the &s;traits, but at Cape Froward it was our hard hap to have our boat &s;unk at our &s;tern in the night, and to lo&s;e all our oars.</P>
<P>On the 20th, being thwart of Port De&s;ire, in the night the General altered his cour&s;e, as we &s;uppo&s;e, by which occa&s;ion we lo&s;t him; for, in the evening, he &s;tood clo&s;e by a wind to &s;ea|ward, having the wind at north-north-ea&s;t, and we &s;tanding the &s;ame way, the wind not alter|ing, could not the next day &s;ee him: &s;o that we then per&s;uaded our&s;elves, that he was gone for Port De&s;ire to relieve him&s;elf, or that he had &s;u&s;tained &s;ome mi&s;chance at &s;ea, and was gone thither to remedy it. Whereupon our captain called the General's men unto him, with the re&s;t, and a&s;ked their opinion what was to be done. Every one conjectured that the General was gone for Port De&s;ire. Then the Ma&s;ter, being the General's man, and careful of his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, as al&s;o of good judgment in &s;ea-matters, told the company how dangerous it was to go for Port De&s;ire, if we &s;hould there mi&s;s the General: for (&s;aid he) we have no boat to land our&s;elves, nor any anchors or cables that I dare tru&s;t in &s;o quick &s;treams as are there: yet, in all likelihood, concluding that the General was gone thither, we &s;teered our cour&s;e for Port De&s;ire, and by chance met with the Black Pin|nace,
<PB N="244" REF="318">
which had likewi&s;e lo&s;t the fleet, being in a very mi&s;erable ca&s;e: &s;o we both concluded to &s;eek the General at Port De&s;ire.</P>
<P>The 26th day of May, we came to Port De|&s;ire, where not finding our General as we hop|ed, being mo&s;t &s;lenderly victualled, without &s;ails, boat, oars, nails, cordage, and all other nece&s;&s;aries for our relief, we were &s;truck into a deadly &s;orrow. But, referring all to Provi|dence, we entered the harbour, and found a place of quiet road, which before we knew not. Having moored our &s;hip with the Pinnace's boat, we landed upon the &s;outh &s;hore, where we found a &s;tanding pool of fre&s;h water, which by e&s;timation might hold about ten tons, whereby we were greatly comforted. From this pool we fetched more than forty tons of water, and yet we left the pool as full as we found it. And, becau&s;e at our fir&s;t being at this harbour we were at this place and found no water, we per&s;uaded our&s;elves that God had &s;ent it for our relief Al&s;o there were &s;uch extraordinary low ebbs as we had never &s;een, whereby we got mu&s;cles in plenty and great abundance of &s;melts, &s;o that, with hooks made of pins, every man caught as many as he could eat: by which means we pre|&s;erved our &s;hips victuals, and &s;pent not any during the time of our abode here.</P>
<P>Our Captain and Ma&s;ter, con&s;idering our abi|lity to go to the General, found our wants &s;o great, as that in a month we could not fit our &s;hip to &s;et &s;ail; for we mu&s;t needs &s;et up a
<PB N="245" REF="319">
&s;mith's forge to make bolts, &s;pikes, and nails, be&s;ides the repairing of our other wants. Where|upon they concluded it to be their be&s;t cour&s;e, to take the pinnace, and to furni&s;h her, and to go to the General with all expedition, leaving the &s;hip and the re&s;t of the company until the General's return; for he had vowed to our Captain, that he would return again to the &s;traits, as he had told us. The Captain and Ma&s;ter of the pinnace, being the General's men, were well contented with the motion.</P>
<P>But the General having in our &s;hip two mo&s;t pe&s;tilent fellows, when they heard of this deter|mination, they utterly mi&s;liked it, and, in &s;e|cret, dealt with the company of both &s;hips, ve|hemently per&s;uaded them that our Captain and Ma&s;ter would leave them in the country to be devoured by the cannibals, and that they were mercile&s;s and without charity: whereupon the whole company joined in &s;ecret with them, in a night, to murder our Captain and Ma&s;ter, with my&s;elf and all tho&s;e they thought were their friends. There were marks taken in his cabin, how to kill him with mu&s;quets through the &s;hip's &s;ide, and bullets made of &s;ilver for the execution, if their other purpo&s;es &s;hould fail. All agreed hereunto except the boat&s;wain of our &s;hip, who, when he knew the matter, revealed it to the Ma&s;ter, and &s;o to the Captain. Then the matter being called in que&s;tion, tho&s;e two mur|derous fellows were found out, who&s;e names were Charles Parker and Edward Smith.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="320">The Captain, being thus hardly be&s;et, in pe|ril of famine, and in danger of being murdered, was con&s;trained to u&s;e lenity, and by courteous means to pacify this fury: &s;hewing, that, to do the General &s;ervice, unto whom he had vow|ed faith in this action, was the cau&s;e why he purpo&s;ed to go unto him in the pinnace, con&s;i|dering that the pinnace was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a thing for him, as that he could not be without her, becau&s;e he was fearful of the &s;hore in &s;o great &s;hips. Whereupon all cried, with cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, that the pinnace &s;hould not go unle&s;s the &s;hip went. Then the Captain de&s;ired them to &s;hew them&s;elves chri&s;tians, and not &s;o bla&s;|phemou&s;ly to behave them&s;elves, without regard and thank&s;giving to God for their great delive|rance. By which gentle &s;peeches, the matter was pacified, and the Captain and Ma&s;ter, at the reque&s;t of the company, were content to forgive this great treachery of Parker and Smith, who, after many admonitions, concluded in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Lord judge between you and me:"</Q> which after came to a mo&s;t &s;harp re|venge, even by the puni&s;hment of the Almigh|ty. Thus, by a general con&s;ent, it was con|cluded not to depart, but to &s;tay there for the General's return. Then our Captain and Ma&s;|ter, &s;eeing that they could not do the General that &s;ervice which they de&s;ired, made a motion to the company, that they would lay down un|der their hands the lo&s;ing of the General, with the extremities wherein we then &s;tood: where|unto

<P>"THE 26th of Augu&s;t 1591, we who&s;e names are here underwritten, with divers others, departed from Plymouth, under Mr. Thomas Cavendi&s;h our General, with four &s;hips of his, viz. the Leice&s;ter, the Roebuck, the De&s;ire, and the Black Pinnace, for the performance of a voyage into the South Sea. The 19th of No|vember, we fell in with the bay of Salvador, in Brazil. The 16th of December we took the town of Santos, hoping there to revictual our|&s;elves, but it fell not out to our contentment. The 24th of January we &s;et &s;ail from Santos, &s;haping our cour&s;e for the &s;traits of Magellan. The 8th of February, by violent &s;torms, the &s;aid fleet being parted, the Roebuck and the De&s;ire arrived at Port De&s;ire the &s;ixth of March. The &s;ixteenth of March, the Black Pinnace arrived there al&s;o: and the 18th of the &s;ame, our Admiral came into the road, with whom we departed the 20th of March in poor and weak e&s;tate. The 8th of April 1592, we entered the &s;traits of Ma|gellan. The 21&s;t of April we anchored beyond Cape Froward, within 40 leagues of the South Sea, where we rode until the 15th of May. In
<PB N="248" REF="322">
which time we had great &s;tore of &s;now, with &s;ome gu&s;ty weather, the wind continuing &s;till we&s;t-north-we&s;t again&s;t us. In this time we were inforced, for the pre&s;erving of our vic|tuals, to live the mo&s;t part upon mu&s;cles, our provi&s;ion was &s;o &s;lender; &s;o that many of our men died in this hard extremity. Then our Ge|neral returned for Brazil, there to winter, and to procure victuals for this voyage again&s;t the next year. So we departed the &s;traits, the 15th of May. The 21&s;t, being thwart of Port De&s;ire, 36 leagues off the &s;hore, the wind then at north-ea&s;t and by-north, at five of the clock at night, lying north-ea&s;t, we &s;uddenly ca&s;t about, lying &s;outh ea&s;t and by-&s;outh, and &s;ometimes &s;outh-ea&s;t: the whole fleet following the Admiral, our &s;hip coming under his lee, &s;hot a-head of him, and &s;o framed &s;ail fit to keep company. This night we were &s;evered, by what occa&s;ion we prote&s;t we know not, whether we lo&s;t them or they us. In the morning we only &s;aw the Black Pinnace, then &s;uppo&s;ing the Admiral had over&s;hot us. All this day we &s;tood to the ea&s;t|wards, hoping to find him; becau&s;e it was not likely that he would &s;tand to the &s;hore again &s;o &s;uddenly. But mi&s;&s;ing him towards night, we &s;tood to the &s;horeward, hoping by that cour&s;e to find him. The 22d of May, at night, we had a violent &s;torm, with the wind at north-we&s;t, and we were inforced to hull, not being able to bear &s;ail; and this night we peri&s;hed our main tre&s;sle-trees, &s;o that we could no more u&s;e our main-top-&s;ail, ly|ing

mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly in the &s;ea. The pinnace likewi&s;e received a great leak, &s;o that we were inforced to &s;eek the next &s;hore for our relief. And, becau&s;e famine was like to be the be&s;t end, we de&s;ired to go for Port De&s;ire, hoping, with &s;eals and penguins, to relieve our&s;elves, and &s;o to make &s;hift to follow the General, or there to &s;tay his coming from Bra&s;il. The 24th of May we had much wind at north. The 25th was calm, and the &s;ea very lofty, &s;o that our &s;hip had dangerous foul weather. The 26th, our fore-&s;hrouds broke, &s;o that, if we had not been near the &s;hore, it had been impo&s;&s;ible for us to get out of the &s;ea. And now, being here moored in Port De&s;ire, our &s;hrouds are all rotten, not hav|ing a running rope whereto we may tru&s;t, and being provided of only one &s;hift of &s;ails, all worn, our top-&s;ails not able to abide any &s;tre&s;s of wea|ther; neither have we any pitch, tar, or nails, nor any &s;tore for the &s;upplying of the&s;e wants; and we live only upon &s;eals and mu&s;cles, having but five hog&s;heads of pork within board, and meal three ounces for a man a day, with water for to drink. And for as much as it hath plea&s;|ed God to &s;eparate our fleet, and to bring us into &s;uch hard extremities, that only now by his mere mercy we expect relief, though otherwi&s;e we are hopele&s;s of comfort; yet, becau&s;e the wonderful works of God, in his exceeding great favour to|wards us his creatures, are far beyond the &s;cope of man's capacity, therefore by him we hope to have deliverance in this our deep di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>After they had delivered this under their hands, then we began to labour to pre&s;erve our lives; and we built up a &s;mith's forge, and made nails, bolts, and &s;pikes; others made ropes of a piece of our cable; and the re&s;t gathered mu&s;cles, and took &s;melts, for the whole company. Three leagues from this harbour there is an i&s;le with four &s;mall i&s;les about it, where there are abun|dance of &s;eals; and, at that time of the year, the penguins came thither, in great plenty, to breed. We concluded with the pinnace, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ometimes go thither to catch &s;eals for us; upon which condition we would &s;hare vic|tuals with her man for man; whereunto the whole company agreed. So we parted our poor &s;tore, and &s;he laboured to fetch us &s;eals to eat, wherewith we lived when &s;melts and mu&s;cles failed; for in the nep-tides we could get no mu&s;cles. Thus, in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable calamity, we remained until the 6th of Augu&s;t, &s;till keep|ing watch upon the hills to look for our Gene|ral; and &s;o great was our vexation and angui&s;h of &s;oul, as I think never fle&s;h and blood endured more.

and our hope of the General being very cold, our Captain and Ma&s;ter were fully per|&s;uaded that the General might, perhaps, go di|rectly for the &s;traits, and not come to this har|bour: whereupon, they thought no cour&s;e more convenient, than to go pre&s;ently for the &s;traits, and there to &s;tay his coming; for, in that place he could not pa&s;s, but of cour&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ee him: Whereunto the company mo&s;t willingly con&s;ent|ed, as al&s;o the Captain and Ma&s;ter of the pinnace, &s;o that upon this determination we made all po&s;|&s;ible &s;peed to depart.</P>
<P>The 6th of Augu&s;t, we &s;et &s;ail, and went to Penguin I&s;le; and, the next day, we &s;alted 20 hog&s;heads of &s;eals, which was as much as our &s;alt could do. The 7th, towards night, we de|parted from Penguin I&s;le. The 9th, we had a &s;ore &s;torm, &s;o that we were con&s;trained to hull, for our &s;ails were not fit to endure any force. The 14th, we were driven in among certain i&s;les never before di&s;covered by any known relation, lying fifty leagues, or better, off the &s;hore, ea&s;t and northerly from the &s;traits; in which place, had not the wind cea&s;ed, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have peri&s;hed. But, the wind &s;hifting, we di|rected our cour&s;e for the &s;traits; and, the 18th of Augu&s;t, we fell in with the Cape in a very thick fog; and, the &s;ame night, we anchored ten leagues within the Cape. The 19th, we pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;traits. The 21&s;t, we doubled Cape Froward. The 22d, we anchored in Salvage Cove, &s;o called becau&s;e we &s;aw many &s;a|vages

there. Notwith&s;tanding the extreme cold of this place, yet do all the&s;e people go naked, and live in the woods like &s;atyrs, painted and di&s;|gui&s;ed, and flee from you like wild deer. They are very &s;trong, and threw &s;tones at us of three or four pounds weight, an incredible di&s;tance. The 24th, in the morning, we departed from this cove, and the &s;ame day we came into the north-we&s;t reach, which is the la&s;t reach of the &s;traits. The 25th, we anchored in a good cove, within 14 leagues of the South Sea: in this place we purpo&s;ed to &s;tay for the General; for the &s;trait at this place, is &s;carce three miles broad, &s;o that he could not pa&s;s but we mu&s;t &s;ee him. After we had &s;taid here a fortnight in the depth of winter, our victuals con&s;uming (for our &s;eals &s;tunk mo&s;t vilely, and our men died pitifully through cold and famine, for the greate&s;t part of them had not cloaths to defend them from the extremity of the winter's cold); being in this heavy di&s;tre&s;s, our Captain and Ma&s;ter thought it the be&s;t cour&s;e to depart from the &s;traits into the South Sea, and to go for the i&s;le of Santa Maria, which is to the northward of Baldivia, in 37 deg. 15 min. where we might have relief, and be in a temperate clime, and there &s;tay for the General, for of nece&s;&s;ity he mu&s;t come by that i&s;le. So we departed the 13th of September, and came in &s;ight of the South Sea. On the 14th, we were forced back again, and recovered a cove, three leagues within the &s;traits from the South Sea.

of the land, the wind ri&s;ing furiou&s;ly at we&s;t-north-we&s;t, we were forced back again into the &s;traits for want of &s;ails; for we never dur&s;t bear &s;ail in any &s;tre&s;s of weather, they were &s;o weak: &s;o again we recovered the cove three leagues within the &s;traits, where we endured mo&s;t furious weather; &s;o that one of our two cables brake, whereby we were hopele&s;s of life: yet it plea&s;ed God to calm the &s;torm, and we unreev'd our &s;heets, tacks, halliards, and other ropes, and moored our &s;hip to the trees, clo&s;e by the rocks. We laboured to recover our anchor again, but could not, it lay &s;o deep in the water, and, as we think, covered with oaze. Now had we but one anchor, which had but one whole fluke, a cable &s;pliced in two places, and a piece of an old one. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e our troubles, the wind came fair the fir&s;t of October; whereupon, with all expedition, we loo&s;ed our moorings, and weighed our anchor, and &s;o towed off into the channel; for we had mended our boat in Port De&s;ire, and had five oars of the pinnace. When we had weighed our anchor, we found our cable broken; only one &s;trand held. Being in the channel, we reeved our ropes, and again rigged our &s;hip; no man's hand was idle, but all laboured even for the la&s;t ga&s;p of life. Here our company was divided; &s;ome de&s;ired to go again for Port De|&s;ire, and there to be &s;et on &s;hore, where they might travel for their lives; and &s;ome &s;tood with the Captain and Ma&s;ter to proceed. Whereupon the Captain &s;aid to the Ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"Ma&s;ter, you
<PB N="254" REF="329">
&s;ee the wonderful extremity of our e&s;tate, and the great doubts among our company of the truth of your reports, as touching relief to be had in the South Sea. Now, good Ma&s;ter, for as much as you have been in this voyage once before with your Ma&s;ter the General, &s;atisfy the company of &s;uch truths as are to you be&s;t known; and, you the re&s;t of the General's men, who likewi&s;e have been with him in his fir&s;t voyage, if you hear any thing contrary to the truth, &s;pare not to reprove it, I pray you."</Q> Then the Ma&s;ter &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you think good to return, I will not gain&s;ay it: but this I think, if life may be pre&s;erved by any means, it is in proceeding; for at the i&s;le of Santa Maria I do a&s;&s;ure you of wheat, pork, and roots enough. Al&s;o, I will bring you to an i&s;le where pelicans be in great abundance, and we &s;hall have meal in great plenty, be&s;ides a po&s;&s;ibility of intercept|ing &s;ome &s;hips upon the coa&s;t of Chili and Peru. But, if we return, there is nothing but death to be hoped for: therefore, do as you like, I am ready; but my de&s;ire is to proceed."</Q> The&s;e his &s;peeches, being confirmed by others that were in the former voyage, there was a general con&s;ent for proceeding; and &s;o, the 2d of October, we put into the South Sea, and were free of all land. This night the wind began to blow very much at we&s;t-north-we&s;t, and &s;till increa&s;ed in fury, &s;o that we were in great doubt what cour&s;e to take. To put into the &s;traits we dur&s;t not, for lack of ground-tackle: to bear &s;ail we doubted, the
<PB N="255" REF="330">
tempe&s;t was &s;o furious, and our &s;ails &s;o bad. The pinnace came round with us, and told us that &s;he had received many grievous &s;eas, and that her ropes did every hour fail her, &s;o as they could not tell what &s;hift to make. We, being unable in any &s;ort to help her, &s;tood under our cour&s;es in view of the lee-&s;hore, &s;till expecting our rui|nous end.</P>
<P>The 4th of October, the &s;torm growing be|yond mea&s;ure furious, the pinnace, being in the wind of us, &s;truck &s;uddenly a hull, &s;o that we thought &s;he had received &s;ome grievous &s;ea, or &s;prung a leak, or that her &s;ails failed her, becau&s;e &s;he came not with us; but we dur&s;t not hull in that unmerciful &s;torm, but &s;ometimes tried un|der our main cour&s;e, &s;ometimes with a haddock of our &s;ail, for our &s;hip was very leeward, and mo&s;t labour&s;ome in the &s;ea. This night we lo&s;t the pinnace, and never &s;aw her again.</P>
<P>The 5th, our fore-&s;ail was &s;plit and all torn: then our Ma&s;ter took the mizzen, and brought it to the fore-ma&s;t, to make our &s;hip work, and with our &s;prit-&s;ail we mended our fore-&s;ail, the &s;torm continuing beyond all de&s;cription in fury, with hail, &s;now, rain, and wind, &s;uch and &s;o mighty, as that in nature it could not po&s;&s;ibly be more, the &s;ea &s;uch and &s;o lofty, with continual breach, that many times we were doubtful whe|ther our &s;hip did &s;ink or &s;wim.</P>
<P>The 10th of October, being, by the account of our Captain and Ma&s;ter, very near the &s;hore, the weather dark, the &s;torm furious, and mo&s;t of our
<PB N="256" REF="331">
men having given over to labour, we yielded our&s;elves to death without further hope of &s;uc|cour. Our Captain &s;itting in the gallery very pen&s;ive, I came and brought him &s;ome <HI>ro&s;a &s;olis,</HI> to comfort him; for he was &s;o cold, that he was &s;carce able to move a joint. After he had drank, and was comforted in heart, he began, for the ea&s;e of his con&s;cience, to make a large repetition of his forepa&s;&s;ed time, and with many grievous &s;ighs, he concluded with a &s;hort prayer for our pre&s;ervation. Having ended, he de&s;ired me not to make known to any of the company his into|lerable grief and angui&s;h of mind, becau&s;e they &s;hould not thereby be di&s;mayed. And &s;o &s;uddenly, before I went from him, the &s;un &s;hined clear; &s;o that he and the Ma&s;ter both ob&s;erved the true elevation of the Pole, whereby they knew by what cour&s;e to recover the &s;traits. Wherewithal our Captain and Ma&s;ter were &s;o revived, and gave &s;uch comfortable &s;peeches to the company, that every man rejoiced, as though we had re|ceived a pre&s;ent deliverance. The next day, being the 11th of October, we &s;aw Cape De|&s;eado, being the cape on the &s;outh &s;hore (the north &s;hore being nothing but a company of dangerous rocks, i&s;les, and &s;hoals). This cape being within two leagues to the leeward of us, our Ma&s;ter greatly doubted that we could not double the &s;ame: neverthele&s;s, being a man of good &s;pirit, he re&s;olutely made quick di&s;patch, and &s;et &s;ail. Our &s;ails had not been half an hour on board, but the foot-rope of our fore-&s;ail
<PB N="257" REF="332">
brake, &s;o that nothing held but the oylet-holes. The &s;eas continually brake over the &s;hip's poop, and flew into the &s;ails with &s;uch violence, that we &s;till expected the tearing of our &s;ails, or over|&s;etting of the &s;hip; and, be&s;ides, to our utter di&s;|comfort, we perceived that we fell &s;till more and more to lee-ward, &s;o that we could not double the cape. We were now come within half a mile of the cape, and &s;o near the &s;hore, that the counter &s;urf of the &s;ea would rebound again&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide, &s;o that we were much di&s;mayed with the horror of our pre&s;ent end. Being thus at the very point of our death, the wind and the &s;eas raging beyond mea&s;ure, our Ma&s;ter veered &s;ome of the main &s;heet; and whether it was by that occa&s;ion, or by &s;ome current, or by the wonderful power of God, as we verily think it was, the &s;hip quickened her way, and &s;hot pa&s;t that rock, where we thought we &s;hould have &s;hored. Then between the cape and the point there was a little bay; &s;o that we were &s;ome|what farther from the &s;hore: and, when we came &s;o far as the cape, we yielded to death; yet the Father of all mercies delivered us, and we doubled the cape about the length of our &s;hip, or very little more. Being &s;hot pa&s;t the cape, we pre&s;ently took in our &s;ails, which only God had pre&s;erved unto us; and when we were &s;hot in between the high lands, the wind blowing trade, without an inch of &s;ail, we &s;pooned be|fore the &s;ea, three men being not able to guide the helm, and in &s;ix hours we were put twenty-five
<PB N="258" REF="333">
leagues within the &s;traits, where we found a &s;ea an&s;werable to the ocean.</P>
<P>In this time we freed our &s;hip from water, and after we had re&s;ted a little, our men were not able to move; their &s;inews were &s;tiff, and their fle&s;h dead, and many of them (which is mo&s;t la|mentable to be reported) were &s;o eaten with lice, as that in their fle&s;h did lie clu&s;ters of them, as big as pea&s;e, yea and &s;ome as big as beans. Being in this mi&s;ery, we were con&s;trained to put into a cove, for the refre&s;hing of our men. Our Ma&s;ter knowing the &s;hore, and every cove very perfectly, put in with the &s;hore, and moored to the trees, as before time we had done, laying our anchor to the &s;ea-ward. Here we continued until the 20th of October; but not being able any longer to &s;tay, through extremity of famine, the 21&s;t we put off into the channel, the weather being rea&s;onably calm: but before night it blew mo&s;t extremely at we&s;t-north-we&s;t. The &s;torm growing outra|geous, our men could &s;carcely &s;tand by their la|bour; and, the &s;traits being full of turning reaches, we were con&s;trained by the di&s;cretion of the Captain and Ma&s;ter in their accounts, to guide the &s;hip in the hell-dark night, when we could not &s;ee any &s;hore, the channel being in &s;ome places &s;carce three miles broad. But our Captain, as we fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits, drew &s;uch an exqui&s;ite plan of the &s;ame, as I am a&s;&s;ured it cannot in any &s;ort be bettered: which plan he and the Ma&s;ter &s;o often peru&s;ed, and &s;o carefully regarded, as that in memory they had
<PB N="259" REF="334">
every turn and creek, and in the deep-dark night, without any doubting, they conveyed the &s;hip through that crooked channel; &s;o that I con|clude, the world hath not any &s;o &s;kilful pilots for that place, as they are; for otherwi&s;e we could never have pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch &s;ort as we did.</P>
<P>The 25th, we came to an i&s;land in the &s;traits, named Penguin I&s;le, whither we &s;ent our boat to &s;eek relief, for there were great abundance of birds, and the weather was very calm; &s;o we came to an anchor by the i&s;land in &s;even fa|thoms. While our boat was on &s;hore, and we had great &s;tore of penguins, there aro&s;e a &s;ud|den &s;torm, &s;o that our &s;hip did drive over a breach, and our boat &s;unk at the &s;hore. Cap|tain Cotton and the Lieutenant, being on &s;hore, leapt into the boat and freed the &s;ame, and threw away all the birds, and with great difficulty re|covered the &s;hip: my&s;elf al&s;o was in the boat at the &s;ame time, where for my life I laboured to the be&s;t of my power. The &s;hip, all this while driving upon the lee-&s;hore, when we came on board we helped to &s;et &s;ail, and weighed the anchor; for before our coming they could &s;carce hoi&s;t up their yards, yet with much ado they &s;et their fore-cour&s;e. Thus in a mighty fret of weather, the 27th day of October we were free of the &s;traits, and the 30th of October we came to Penguin I&s;le, being three leagues from Port De&s;ire, the place where we purpo&s;ed to &s;eek for our relief.</P>
<P>When we were come to this i&s;le we &s;ent our boat on &s;hore, which returned laden with birds
<PB N="260" REF="335">
and eggs; and our men &s;aid the penguins were &s;o thick upon the i&s;le, that &s;hips might be laden with them; for they could not go without trampling upon the birds, whereat we greatly rejoiced. Then the captain appointed Charles Parker and Edward Smith, with twenty others, to go on &s;hore, and to &s;tay upon the i&s;le, for the killing and drying of the&s;e penguins, and promi&s;ed, after the &s;hip was in harbour, to &s;end the re&s;t, not only for expedition, but al&s;o to &s;ave the &s;mall &s;tore of victuals in the &s;hip. But Parker, Smith, and the re&s;t of their faction, &s;u&s;pected that this was a device of the captain's to leave his men on &s;hore, that, by the&s;e means, there might be victuals for the re&s;t to recover their country: and when they remembered that this was the place where they would have &s;lain their captain and ma&s;ter, &s;urely (thought they) for revenge hereof will they leave us on &s;hore. Which, when our captain under&s;tood, he called God to witne&s;s, that revenge was no part of his thoughts; they gave him thanks, de&s;iring to go into the harbour with the &s;hip, which he granted. So there were only ten left upon the i&s;le, and the la&s;t of October we entered the har|bour. Our ma&s;ter, at our la&s;t being here, hav|ing taken careful notice of every creek in the river, in a very convenient place, upon &s;andy oaze, ran the &s;hip a-ground, laying our anchor to &s;eaward, and with our running ropes moored her to &s;takes upon the &s;hore, which he had fa&s;tened for that purpo&s;e; where the &s;hip re|mained till our departure.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="336">The 3d of November, our boat with water, wood, and as many as &s;he could carry, went for the i&s;le of Penguins; but being deep &s;he dur&s;t not proceed, but returned again the &s;ame night. Then Parker, Smith, Town&s;hend, Pur|pet, with five others, de&s;ired that they might go by land, and that the boat might fetch them when they were again&s;t the i&s;le, it being &s;carce a mile from the &s;hore. The captain bade them do what they thought be&s;t, advi&s;ing them to take weapons with them: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For, (&s;aith he) al|though we have not at any time &s;een people in this place, yet in the country there may be &s;avages."</Q> They an&s;wered: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That here were great &s;tore of deer, and o&s;triches: but if there were &s;avages, they would devour them."</Q> Notwith&s;tanding, the captain cau&s;ed them to take weapons with them, carlivers, &s;words, and tar|gets: &s;o the 6th of November, they departed by land, and the boat by &s;ea; but from that day to this day we never heard of our men. The 11th, while mo&s;t of our men were at the i&s;le, only the captain and ma&s;ter, with &s;ix others, being left in the &s;hip, there came a great multi|tude of &s;avages to the &s;hip, throwing du&s;t in the air, leaping and running like brute bea&s;ts, hav|ing vizards on their faces like dogs faces, or el&s;e their faces are dogs faces indeed. We greatly feared le&s;t they would &s;et our &s;hip on fire, for they would &s;uddenly make fire, whereat we much marvelled: they came to windward of our &s;hip, and &s;et the bu&s;hes on fire, &s;o that we were
<PB N="262" REF="337">
in a very &s;tinking &s;moak; but as &s;oon as they came within our &s;hot, we &s;hot at them, and &s;triking one of them in the thigh, they all pre|&s;ently fled; &s;o that we never &s;aw more of them. Hereby we judged, that the&s;e cannibals had &s;lain our nine men. When we con&s;idered who they were that were thus murdered, and found that they were the principal men who would have murdered the captain and ma&s;ter, with their friends, we &s;aw the ju&s;t judgment of God, and made &s;upplication to his Divine Maje&s;ty to be merciful unto us. While we were in this har|bour, our captain and ma&s;ter went with the boat to di&s;cover how far this river did run, that if need &s;hould enforce us to leave our &s;hip, we might know how far we might go by water: &s;o they found, that, farther than twenty miles, they could not go with the boat. At their re|turn they &s;ent the boat to the i&s;le of penguins: whereby we under&s;tood that the penguins dried to our hearts content, and that the multitude of them was infinite. All the time that we were in this place, we fared pa&s;&s;ing well with eggs, penguins, young &s;eals, young gulls, and other birds, &s;uch as I know not, of all which we had abundance. In this place we found an herb called Scurvy-gra&s;s, which we fried with eggs, u&s;ing train-oil in&s;tead of butter. This herb did &s;o purge the blood, that it took away all kinds of &s;wellings, of which many had died, and re|&s;tored us to perfect health of body; &s;o that we were in as good ca&s;e as when we came fir&s;t out
<PB N="263" REF="338">
of England. We &s;taid in this harbour until the 22d of December, in which time we had dried 20,000 penguins; and the captain, the ma&s;ter, and my&s;elf, had made &s;ome &s;alt, by lay|ing &s;alt-water upon the rocks in holes, which, in &s;ix days would be kerned. Thus God did feed us, even as it were with manna from heaven.</P>
<P>The 22d of December, we departed with our &s;hip for the i&s;le, where, with great difficulty, by the &s;kilful indu&s;try of our ma&s;ter, we got 14,000 of our birds, and had almo&s;t lo&s;t our captain in labouring to bring the birds on board: and, had not our ma&s;ter been very ex|pert in the &s;et of tho&s;e tides, which run after ma|ny fa&s;hions, we had al&s;o lo&s;t our &s;hip in the &s;ame place. The 22d at night we departed with 14,000 dried penguins, not being able to fetch the re&s;t, and &s;haped our cour&s;e for Brazil. Now, our captain rated our victuals, and brought us to &s;uch allowance, as that our victuals might la&s;t &s;ix months; for our hope was, that within &s;ix months we might recover our country, though our &s;ails were very bad. So our allow|ance was two ounces and an half of meal for a man a-day, and to have &s;o twice a-week; &s;o that five ounces did &s;erve for a week. Three days a week we had oil, three &s;poonfuls for a man a-day; and two days in a week pea&s;e, a pint among four men a-day, and every day five penguins for four men, and &s;ix quarts of wa|ter for four men a-day. This was our allow|ance;
<PB N="264" REF="339">
wherewith we lived, though weakly, and very feeble. The 30th of January, we arrived at the i&s;le of Placentia in Brazil, the fir&s;t place that, outward-bound, we were at: and having made the &s;hoal, our &s;hip lying off at &s;ea, the captain, with twenty-four of the company, went with the boat on &s;hore, being a whole night before they could recover it. The la&s;t of January, at &s;un|ri&s;ing, they &s;uddenly landed, hoping to take the Portugue&s;e in their hou&s;es, and by that means to recover &s;ome Ca&s;avi meal, or other victuals for our relief; but when they looked for the hou&s;es, they were all razed and burnt to the ground, &s;o that we thought no man had remain|ed on the i&s;land. Then the captain went to the gardens, and brought from thence fruits and roots for the company, and came on board the &s;hip, and brought her into a fine creek which we had found out, where we might moor her by the trees, and where there was water, and hoops to trim our ca&s;ks. Our ca&s;e being very de&s;perate, we pre&s;ently laboured for di&s;patch away; &s;ome cut hoops, which the coopers made, others la|boured upon the &s;ails and &s;hip, every man tra|vailing for his life; and &s;till a guard was kept on &s;hore to defend tho&s;e that laboured, every man having likewi&s;e his weapon by him. The 3d of February, our men, with twenty-three &s;hot, went again to the gardens, being three miles from us upon the north &s;hore, and fetched Ca&s;avi-roots out of the ground, to relieve our company, in&s;tead of bread; for we &s;pent not of
<PB N="265" REF="340">
our meal while we &s;taid here. The 5th of Fe|bruary, being Monday, our captain and ma&s;ter ha&s;tened the company to their labour; &s;o &s;ome went with the coopers to gather hoops, and the re&s;t laboured on board. This night many of our men in the &s;hip dreamed of murder and &s;laugh|ter: in the morning they reported their dreams: one &s;aying to another, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This night I dreamed that thou wert &s;lain."</Q> Another an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I dreamed that thou wert &s;lain."</Q> And this was general through the &s;hip. The Captain hearing this, who likewi&s;e had dreamed very &s;trangely him&s;elf, gave very &s;trict charge, that tho&s;e who went on &s;hore &s;hould take weapons with them, and &s;aw them him&s;elf delivered into the boat, and &s;ent &s;ome on purpo&s;e to guard the labourers. All the forenoon they laboured in quietne&s;s, and when it was ten o'clock, the heat being extreme, they came to a rock near the wood's &s;ide (for all this country is nothing but thick woods), and there they boiled Ca&s;avi-roots, and dined. After dinner &s;ome &s;lept, others wa&s;hed them&s;elves in the &s;ea, all being &s;tripped to their &s;hirts, and no man keeping watch, no match lighted, and not a piece charged. Suddenly, as they were thus &s;leeping and &s;porting, having got them&s;elves into a cor|ner, out of &s;ight of the &s;hip, there came a mul|titude of Indians and Portugue&s;e upon them, and &s;lew them &s;leeping: only two e&s;caped, one very &s;ore hurt, the other not touched, by whom we under&s;tood of this mi&s;erable ma&s;|&s;acre.
<PB N="266" REF="341">
With all &s;peed we manned our boat, and landed to &s;uccour our men; but we found them &s;lain, and laid naked in rank one by another, with their faces upward, and a cro&s;s &s;et by them: and withal we &s;aw two very great pinnaces come from the river of Janeiro very full of men; who we &s;u&s;pected came from thence to take us; becau&s;e there came from Janeiro &s;oldiers to Santos, when the General had taken the town, and was &s;trong in it. Of &s;eventy-&s;ix per&s;ons who departed in our &s;hip out of England, we were now left but twenty-&s;even, having lo&s;t thirteen in this place, with their chief furniture, as mu&s;kets, calivers, powder, and &s;hot. Our ca&s;ks were all in decay, &s;o that we could not take in more water than was in our &s;hip, for want of ca&s;ks, and that which we had was marvellous ill-conditioned. And being there moored by trees, for want of cables and anchors, we &s;till expected the cutting of our moorings, to be beaten from our decks with our own furniture, and to be a&s;&s;ailed by them of Janeiro. What di&s;tre&s;s we were now driven into, I am not able to expre&s;s. To depart with eight tons of water in &s;uch bad ca&s;ks, was to &s;tarve at &s;ea, and in &s;taying our ca&s;e was ruin|ous. The&s;e were hard choices; but, being thus perplexed, we made choice rather to fall into the hands of the Lord than into the hands of men. So, concluding to depart, the 6th of February we were off in the channel, with our ordnance, and &s;mall &s;hot, in readine&s;s for any a&s;&s;ault that &s;hould come; and, having a &s;mall
<PB N="267" REF="342">
gale of wind, we recovered the &s;ea in mo&s;t deep di&s;tre&s;s. Then bemoaning our e&s;tate one to ano|ther, and recounting over all our extremities, no|thing grieved us more than the lo&s;s of our men twice, fir&s;t being &s;laughtered by the cannibals at Port De&s;ire, and at this i&s;le of Placentia by the Indians and Portugue&s;e. And con&s;idering what they were who were lo&s;t, we found that all tho&s;e who con&s;pired the murdering of our Captain and Ma&s;ter were now &s;lain by &s;avages, the gunner only excepted. Being thus at &s;ea, when we came to Cape Frio the wind was contrary; &s;o that three weeks we were grievou&s;ly vexed with cro&s;s winds; and, our water con&s;uming, our hope of life was very &s;mall. Some de&s;ired to go to Baya, and to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Portugue&s;e, rather than to die for thir&s;t: but the Captain, with fair per&s;ua&s;ions altered their purpo&s;e of yielding to the Portugu&s;e. In this di&s;tre&s;s it plea&s;ed God to &s;end us rain in &s;uch plenty, as that we were well watered, and in good comfort to return. But after we came near unto the &s;un, our dried penguins began to corrupt, and there bred in them a mo&s;t loath|&s;ome and ugly worm, of an inch long.

The Ma&s;ter and Captain taking their turns at the helm, were mightily di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and mon&s;trou&s;ly grieved with the woeful lamentation of our &s;ick men. Thus, as lo&s;t wanderers upon the &s;ea, the 11th of June 1593, it plea&s;ed God that we arrived at Bear Haven in Ireland, and there ran the &s;hip on &s;hore; where the Iri&s;hmen helped us to take in our &s;ails, and to moor our &s;hip for floating; which &s;lender pains of theirs co&s;t our Captain ten pounds, before he could have the &s;hip in &s;afety. Thus, without victuals, &s;ails, men, or any furniture, God only guided us into Ireland, where the Captain left the Ma&s;ter and three or four of the company to keep the &s;hip; and, within five days after, he and certain others had pa&s;&s;age in an Engli&s;h fi&s;her-boat to Pad&s;tow, in Cornwall.

a con&s;iderable proportion of their provi&s;ions, but the men became &s;ick; and the &s;curvy, which &s;eldom makes its approaches on this &s;ide the E|quator, had already infected near half the crews.</P>
<P>This reduced them to the nece&s;&s;ity, not only of &s;eeking land, where fre&s;h provi&s;ions might be procured, but of wa&s;ting more time with a view to the recovery of the &s;ick, than was con&s;i&s;tent with the navigation of tho&s;e boi&s;terous &s;eas through which they were to pa&s;s.</P>

<P><PB N="272" REF="347">From this early beginning of di&s;tre&s;s, very little hope could be rea&s;onably entertained of the i&s;&s;ue.

<P>But to pur&s;ue the narrative of the General's proceedings from the time of his parting with the De&s;ire and Black Pinnace in the night of the 20th of May, as already related in the preceding voyage. It appears indeed, that he continued his cour&s;e to the coa&s;t of Brazil accompanied by the Roebuck, which, however, was parted from him in lat. 36<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> S. in one of the mo&s;t grievous &s;torms, as he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, that any Chri&s;|tians ever endured upon the &s;eas to live, in which the Roebuck &s;prung her ma&s;ts, and was otherwi&s;e &s;o much damaged, as to arrive in the bay of St. Vincent in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, being little better than a mere wreck.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="349">The General him&s;elf &s;uffered con&s;iderably, and was forced to take &s;helter likewi&s;e in the &s;ame bay, though the little town of St. Vincent they had burnt on their leaving Santos the &s;um|mer before. Here twenty-five of his men, get|ting drunk on &s;hore, were &s;uddenly &s;et upon by the Portugue&s;e, in revenge for their former treatment, and every man of them &s;laughtered. To revenge this treachery, as it is called, Caven|di&s;h determined to attack Santos, and to level it with the ground; and now, being joined by the crew of the Roebuck, he landed above the town, but was mo&s;t &s;hamefully repul&s;ed, after having plundered a few farm-hou&s;es, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem the cu&s;tom was, &s;et them on fire.</P>
<P>Here being di&s;appointed of his revenge, he departed with a view to attack a &s;mall inhabited i&s;land about twenty leagues to the we&s;tward; from whence, when he had provided him&s;elf with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as the i&s;land could afford, he intended, according to his promi&s;e, and agree|able to the expectations of Davis, to have re|turned to the &s;traits of Magellan, and to have proceeded to the South Seas, in pro&s;ecution of his fir&s;t de&s;ign. But there &s;eemed a fatality at|tending every mea&s;ure he devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>He was diverted from the pro&s;ecution of this enterprize by the per&s;ua&s;ions of a Portugue&s;e pilot on board, who advi&s;ed the attack of Spi|rito Santo, as the only place that could &s;upply his wants, and enable him to refit his &s;hips. In this undertaking he lo&s;t four&s;core of his men
<PB N="275" REF="350">
killed, and forty wounded. And now, having no alternative, but either to return home, or to burn one of his &s;hips for want of hands, and proceed with the other to the &s;traits; the crew of the Roebuck, fearing, as they well might, that theirs was the &s;hip de&s;tined for the flames, watched their opportunity when their Captain was &s;ick on board the General, to make their e&s;cape in the night, taking with them both the &s;urgeons, and, as Cavendi&s;h &s;ays, double the proportion of provi&s;ions for their number of men, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"having with them at their departure but &s;ix and forty men, and carrying away with them the proportion for &s;ix months victual of 120 men at large."</Q> Yet it is not ea&s;y to reconcile the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es for want of provi&s;ions, which are all along complain|ed of from their fir&s;t arrival on the coa&s;t of Bra|zil in the &s;ummer to the pre&s;ent time. In the &s;traits of Magellan, it is a&s;&s;erted, that, to &s;ave their victuals, they were forced in a great mea|&s;ure to live upon &s;ea-weeds, mu&s;cles, periwin|cles, and the fruits of the country; for, &s;ays Knivet, the allowance from the &s;hip was but little.&mdash;But to proceed:</P>
<P>Cavendi&s;h, finding him&s;elf thus for&s;aken, every where di&s;appointed, betrayed, as he com|plains, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t extremity, his &s;hip full of &s;ick and wounded, and him&s;elf with a wounded &s;pirit, directed his cour&s;e to the i&s;land of St. Seba&s;tian, 200 leagues to the we&s;tward of Spirito Santo, where he arrived when he had

but ju&s;t one ca&s;k of water left. Here he &s;et 20 of his &s;ick men a&s;hore; and, having refitted his &s;hip, and refre&s;hed his people, he wanted very much to have &s;ailed back to the &s;traits: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, &s;ays his biographer, his mutinous crew obliged him to &s;ail for England;"</Q> and he died before his return.</P>
<P>In his letter to Sir Tri&s;triam Gorges, which appears to have been written a little before his death, he di&s;covers the utmo&s;t; perturbation of mind. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, &s;ays he, what with grief for the lo&s;s of my mo&s;t dear cou&s;in [John Lock], and the continual trouble I endured among &s;uch hell-hounds [his &s;hip's crew], wi&s;hing my&s;elf upon any de&s;art place in the world, there to die, rather than thus ba&s;ely to return home again; which cour&s;e I had put in execution, had I found an i&s;land which the charts make to be in eight degrees to the &s;outhward of the Line.

But God &s;uffered not &s;uch happi|ne&s;s to light upon me; for I could by no means find it; &s;o was forced to come towards England"</Q></P>
<P>The bitterne&s;s which he expre&s;&s;es again&s;t his crew might, and did, probably, ari&s;e from their determined re&s;olution not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the like hard&s;hips they had already under|gone, and in which the major part of their companions were &s;uffered to peri&s;h without pity,
<PB N="277" REF="352">
and to langui&s;h without relief: for, if we may be|lieve Jane, the &s;ick men on board the General were mo&s;t uncharitably put on &s;hore into the woods in the &s;traits of Magellan; where, according to Cavendi&s;h's own account, <Q REND="inline">"there was nothing but &s;uch flights of &s;now, and extremities of fro&s;ts, as in his life he had never beheld or felt the like. The men, adds he, were well in the morning, and by night frozen to death."</Q> In this mi&s;e|rable manner, in &s;even or eight days, 40 of his crew actually peri&s;hed, and 70 more &s;ickened.</P>
<P>Of the &s;hips that &s;ailed in this expedition, con&s;i&s;ting of five &s;ail, we can trace only three that returned to England, namely, the Galleon, otherwi&s;e named the Leice&s;ter, of which the General was Commander; the Dainty, com|manded by Captain Cotton, who went a volun|teer, and who&s;e &s;hip, having parted company on her fir&s;t arrival on the coa&s;t of Brazil, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing her voyage to the South Seas, re|turned back to England with very little da|mage.</P>
<P>The Roebuck, in which &s;ailed from Ply|mouth 170 brave &s;eamen, after &s;tealing away from the General in the night, as already re|lated, was never more heard of; the Black Pin|nace foundered in a violent &s;torm in the South Sea, and in her about 70 men. Of the crews of the De&s;ire, only 26 out of 150 lived to &s;ee their native country; and, of the General's &s;hip, though the number that peri&s;hed cannot be exactly a&s;certained, yet there could not more than 50 at mo&s;t &s;urvive their General.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="353">Now, if the gallant actions and glorious ex|ploits that entitle men to fame and immortality, involve in their atchievement &s;o many of their fellow-creatures in mi&s;ery, let the benevolent and humane unite with us in depreciating &s;uch murderous practices; and, in&s;tead of holding forth a Drake, or a Cavendi&s;h, as examples wor|thy of imitation, let us hold in dete&s;tation all tho&s;e fal&s;e worthies, who&s;e actions have their ri&s;e in <Q REND="inline">"a ravenous appetite for robbery, and in an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of acquiring wealth without indu&s;try, and greatne&s;s without virtue."</Q></P>

<P>AMONG the Navigators who fir&s;t &s;ur|rounded the globe, Captain William Dampier, con&s;idered as a Mariner and Natura|li&s;t, will ever be held in the foremo&s;t rank.

an opportunity offered of placing him with the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip at Weymouth, agreeable to the inclinations which he had very early di&s;covered of going to &s;ea; a le&s;&s;on to parents and guar|dians to con&s;ult the genius of children, if they would wi&s;h them to ri&s;e to eminence in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion to which they are bred.</P>
<P>With this ma&s;ter he made a &s;hort voyage to France, and was highly gratified: but, his next voyage being to Newfoundland, where he was employed a whole &s;ummer in the fi&s;hery, the ri|gour of the climate and the nature of the &s;er|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;o cooled his ardour for &s;ea-adventures, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">termined to relinqui&s;h the employment, and return to his friends.</P>
<P>He was now eighteen years of age; and, after leading for &s;ome time an idle life, finding his friends begin to look cool upon him, he formed a re&s;olution to leave the country, and to try his fortune in town. His cour&s;e of life, and the natural bent of his inclination, led him to &s;eek the company of &s;ea-faring companions, who, be|ing plea&s;ed with his jovial humour, encouraged him to re&s;ume his old employment, to which, having an opportunity to enter on board an Indiaman, he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded.</P>
<P>In this &s;hip, the John and Martha, Captain Earning, he &s;ailed to Bantam, in quality of a forema&s;tman; and in little more than a year returned to England, perfectly reconciled to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mariner, which, by the &s;everity of

the &s;ervice he was fir&s;t employed in, he had de|termined never to follow.</P>
<P>In this voyage, by favour of the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, he learned the rudiments of the art of na|vigation, in which he afterwards became a great proficient; but he had not yet learned to keep a journal. It &s;hould &s;eem that he employed the following year, after his Indian voyage, in im|proving tho&s;e hints which he received from the ma&s;ter, and in qualifying him&s;elf for an ea&s;ier and more advantageous birth, than that of going before the ma&s;t for the future. With this view he retired again into the country, and &s;pent the &s;ummer with his brother. But, tired of a &s;tudi|ous life, he embraced the occa&s;ion of the Dutch war, to enter on board the Royal Prince, com|manded by Sir Edward Sprague, but in what &s;tation does not appear. He tells us, indeed, that he was in two engagements; but that, fall|ing &s;ick, he was put on board the ho&s;pital &s;hip, and &s;aw the third only at a di&s;tance, in which his Commander was unfortunately killed; &s;o that he does not &s;eem to have ri&s;en higher at this period than the ordinary rank of an able &s;eaman.</P>
<P>Being &s;oon after removed to Harwich among the re&s;t of the &s;ick and wounded, he there lan|gui&s;hed till the conclu&s;ion of the Dutch war, when he received his di&s;charge; and then re|turned again to Somer&s;et&s;hire for the recovery of his health; which was no &s;ooner re&s;tored man he prepared again to go to &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="357">But Colonel Hellier, a neighbouring Gentle|man, having a large plantation in Jamaica, being acquainted with his re&s;olution, made him an offer of going there as a &s;uperintendant, with a hand|&s;ome appointment; which he very readily ac|cepted; and, about the beginning of the year 1674, embarked for Jamaica. But he &s;oon grew tired of land &s;ervice; his roving di&s;po&s;ition &s;till inclining him to &s;eek the &s;ea. The road, he &s;ays, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new office, when he ar|rived at Jamaica, was formerly a great way round: but Mr. Hellier, the Colonel's brother, being de&s;irous of &s;hortening the way, coa&s;ted along the river with &s;ome companions, till they found it run between rocks that ro&s;e perpendi|cular on both &s;ides: they endeavoured to climb that which intercepted the way to the plantation: but, while they with the utmo&s;t danger and dif|ficulty were &s;urmounting the rock, a dog they had with them found a more convenient pa&s;&s;age through a hole. This &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. Hellier a new track: &s;o by blowing up &s;ome fragments of the rock in one part, and levelling &s;ome hol|lows in others, a pa&s;&s;age was obtained wide enough for a loaded hor&s;e.

<P>He was now in his 22d year. In &s;ix months after his arrival at Jamaica he was tired of his &s;uperintendency, and quitted it; and &s;oon after engaged in a trade with the logwood-cutters in Campeachy bay; which trade he followed near three years, and then commenced logwood-cutter

him&s;elf. Un&s;ettled in his mind, and &s;till eager in pur&s;uit of new adventures, in le&s;s than a year he quitted the logwood-cutters; and about the beginning of 1678, returned to England.</P>
<P>In 1679, we find him again returned to Ja|maica, with a cargo of merchandize, which being &s;old at Port Royal, he furni&s;hed him&s;elf with other goods, &s;uch as he knew he could carry to a good market at Campeachy; and by this ad|vantageous traffic, he &s;o inriched him&s;elf, as to be able to purcha&s;e an e&s;tate in his own country, of one whom he knew had a good title to it. And now, &s;ufficiently happy, he was preparing to return home; when one Mr. Hobby invited him to make a &s;hort trading voyage to the Mo&s;|kito-&s;hore, a part of the world he had not yet &s;een. This invitation to embark in a new adventure he could not re&s;i&s;t; and, therefore, &s;ent home the writings of his late purcha&s;e to his brother, with the &s;ame friends whom he purpo&s;ed to have ac|companied to England him&s;elf, and then went on board with Mr. Hobby.</P>

from their infancy; for the children, imitating their parents, never go abroad without a lance, which they throw indifferently at almo&s;t every object that falls in their way, till by con&s;tant practice they become ma&s;ters of the art. They next learn to parry a lance, arrow, or dart; and the training of them to this exerci&s;e is in this manner: Two boys place them&s;elves at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and throw light blunt lances at each other; one throws the lance, and the other par|ries, alternately. He that parries holds a &s;mall &s;tick in his right hand, with which he turns a&s;ide the lance that is darted at him: and, by con&s;tantly practi&s;ing in this manner, they at la&s;t become &s;o dexterous, that they will &s;hoot arrows at each other, and parry them as fa&s;t as they are &s;hot. This they will do with a &s;mall &s;tick no bigger than the rammer of an ordinary fowling-piece.</P>
<P>Before they arrive at manhood, they become &s;o dexterous, that they di&s;regard the arrows of their enemies; and, unle&s;s they are poured thick upon them, and come more than one at a time, they will &s;uffer not one in a thou&s;and to hit them.</P>
<P>They are no le&s;s expert at &s;trinking of fi&s;h: and two or three of them will in tho&s;e &s;eas main|tain a &s;hip's company of 100 men. Turtle and manatee are their principal pur&s;uit: the former will commonly weigh 600 weight; and two Mo&s;kito men will &s;trike two of them a-day, while the &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts, for many days together.
<PB N="285" REF="360">
The manatee is known al&s;o by the name of the &s;ea-cow, and is &s;truck with a harpoon, &s;o con|trived by the Mo&s;kito-men as to be thrown with a long &s;tick; but they are very cautious of di&s;covering their art even to the Engli&s;h&mdash;the Spaniards they hate mortally. The turtle they &s;trike with a different in&s;trument, of which our author has given a cut.</P>
<P>About this time the aera of buccaneering com|mences. The buccaneers were a &s;et of low men, who, in humble imitation of their betters, fir&s;t began with fitting out &s;mall ve&s;&s;els in &s;ome of the i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, and then crui&s;ing in them till they were able to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of better &s;hips. This being accompli&s;hed, they went in formidable compa|nies as occa&s;ion offered, and declared open war again&s;t all the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. The&s;e free-booters had generally two or three Mo&s;kito-men on board each of their ve&s;&s;els, whom they found &s;erviceable in many other re&s;pects be&s;ides &s;upplying them with fi&s;h. By their &s;ituation they had opportunities of being well acquainted with the &s;trength and riches of the Spani&s;h &s;et|tlements, and by their inclination they were their avowed enemies. They therefore &s;erved the buccaneers for guides, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their mo&s;t hazardous attacks.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, let us now return to Dampier, who, as has ju&s;t been &s;aid, had a|greed to make a voyage with Captain Hobby; and having &s;et &s;ail from Port Royal, either by
<PB N="286" REF="361">
accident or de&s;ign, they fell in with Coxen, Sawkings, Sharp, and other buccaneers, who were riding at anchor on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Jamaica, and were then meditating an enterprize over the i&s;thmus of Darien, in order to fall &s;uddenly upon the Spaniards in the South Seas. This expedition, it was given out, would enrich the undertakers; and as all who engaged in it, according to the law of buccaneers, were to be proportionable &s;harers, all Captain Hob|by's men de&s;erted him to join the buccaneers, Dampier only excepted, who, after three or four days con&s;ideration, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to make one among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Shortly after Chri&s;tmas, 1680, they all &s;et &s;ail, and &s;teering to Porto Bello, on the 5th of April, they landed near Golden I&s;land, to the num|ber of between three and four hundred men, and began their march guided by chiefs of the Mu&s;kito Indians, and headed by Captain Saw|kings, who, by general con&s;ent, was cho&s;en their leader.</P>
<P>After a fatiguing journey of nine days, in which many of them &s;uffered great hard&s;hips, they arrived at Santa Martha, a Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ment on a river of that name that empties it|&s;elf into the Southern ocean; which after &s;ome oppo&s;ition they took. They were made to be|lieve, before they approached it, that it was a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength, abounding in riches, and inhabited by merchants of con&s;ider|able property; but upon entering it, they were
<PB N="287" REF="362">
greatly di&s;appointed, and therefore, as might be expected from &s;uch a lawle&s;s crew, they were as ready to fall upon tho&s;e who had projected the enterprize, as upon tho&s;e whom they accounted the enemy.</P>
<P>They now, much di&s;contented with one ano|ther, parted company. One party, continuing their march to the Southern ocean, and there em|barking, &s;ome in canoes, &s;ome in periagos, and &s;ome in &s;mall barks which they found in the ri|ver, continued their cour&s;e to the bay of Pana|ma, and in their way attempted the little town of Puebla Novo, before which their commander in chief Captain Sawkings was killed, and his followers defeated. In what manner this undi&s;|plined crew procured &s;hips, guns, and ammuni|tion, we are not told; yet &s;hips, guns, and am|munition to pur&s;ue their ravages they did pro|cure, as appears by the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Captain Coxen, with his company, fore&s;eeing many difficulties in this Southern project, after the taking of Santa Martha, returned to the North Seas, where he continued his piracies with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Dampier, however, followed the views of tho&s;e who per&s;evered in their fir&s;t re&s;olution of pro&s;ecuting their fortune in the South Seas; and he continued to accompany them during the year 1680; but, after the death of Saw|kings, Captain Sharpe being cho&s;en comman|der in chief in his room, Dampier with many of his companions, &s;u&s;pecting both the courage
<PB N="288" REF="363">
and hone&s;ty of their new leader, entered into a confederacy to di&s;place him, and to choo&s;e Capt. Watling in his room, which they &s;oon found means to accompli&s;h by general con&s;ent. Un|der Captain Sharpe, the only enterprize of con|&s;equence was the taking of Ylo, a &s;mall i&s;land on the Peruvian coa&s;t, from whence they &s;ailed to Juan Fernandez, where, as has been &s;aid, Cap|tain Sharpe was di&s;placed.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that Captain Watling, &s;oon after his advancement, having planned an attack upon Arica, &s;ell a victim to his own pro|ject; for he was killed in the fir&s;t on&s;et, and his party defeated. The confederates, after this misfortune, remaining &s;ome time without a leader, fell again into party divi&s;ions; one party declaring them&s;elves in favour of their former Commander, the other oppo&s;ing his re-election. To put an end to the&s;e di&s;&s;entions, it was at la&s;t agreed to part companies, and to ca&s;t lots which company &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip. It happened that the party in oppo&s;ition to Dam|pier proved the fortunate party; &s;o that Dam|pier and his companions were reduced to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of returning either to the N. Sea over the &s;ame i&s;thmus by which they came into the South, or &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to the mercy of the Spaniards. Nor does it appear that any of them carried more riches back than they brought with them, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t promi&s;es with which they had been flattered at their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out: for it has been generally ob&s;erved,
<PB N="289" REF="364">
that the confederacies of the wicked are defeat|ed by their own deceit; and that they them|&s;elves are, for the mo&s;t part, the in&s;truments of their own misfortunes.</P>
<P>The company with which Dampier cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate, con&s;i&s;ted of 44 men who bore arms, a Spani&s;h Indian who bore arms al&s;o, two Mo&s;|kito Indians, already de&s;cribed, with five &s;laves taken in the South Seas, whom they kept to carry their luggage. The ve&s;&s;els they had to carry this company were, the long-boat belong|ing to the &s;hip, and two canoes, one of which had been &s;awn a&s;under, and joined again; and the&s;e were furni&s;hed for their defence with two patararoes, the companies &s;mall arms, and, a very &s;canty proportion of provi&s;ions and ammu|nition: and, thus equipped, they had to &s;ail more than 200 leagues before they reached the river of Santa Martha, from whence they were to &s;et out on their march by land for the North Sea. Such an enterprize, one would imagine, could hardly have been undertaken with any hope of &s;ucceeding by rea&s;onable men.</P>
<P>On April the 17th, 1681, they parted with Captain Sharpe, 12 leagues to the north-we&s;t of the i&s;land of Plate; and, on May the 1&s;t, they landed, after many &s;trange adventures, in the bay of Panama, in order to pur&s;ue their journey. Here they found the river Santa Martha, of which they meant to avail them&s;elves, blocked up by a &s;hip of con&s;iderable force, that had been &s;tationed there for more than &s;ix months to in|tercept
<PB N="290" REF="365">
their pa&s;&s;age. This obliged them to &s;eek a new tract, through which, however, the greate&s;t part of the company, with incredible dif|ficulty, pa&s;&s;ed &s;afe to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, among whom was Dampier, who&s;e hardine&s;s enabled him to undergo the &s;evere&s;t trials, and who&s;e well-judged precautions exempted him from many unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ufferings, to which others by their imprudence frequently expo&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of May, about three in the after|noon, they began their march; and, on the 23d, they completed their journey; in which time they travelled 110 miles, cro&s;&s;ing &s;ome lofty mountains, but chiefly keeping along the vallies among deep and dangerous rivers, &s;ome of which they forded, &s;ome they pa&s;&s;ed by felling large trees upon the banks, and &s;ome they were obliged to &s;wim over in their cloaths and accou|trements. Tho&s;e who could not &s;wim were dragged through by means of ropes. Their fir&s;t landing-place upon the &s;outh coa&s;t was very di&s;advantageous to them, and forced them to a circuit of 50 miles more than was nece&s;&s;ary. Could they have landed in the bay of Santa Mar|tha, or navigated the river Chepoa, by either of which the Indians pa&s;s from one &s;hore to the other, in three days, they might have &s;hortened their journey more than one half.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, however, who arrived on the north coa&s;t fir&s;t, among whom was Dampier, embark|ed immediately on board a French buccaneer, Captain Tri&s;trian, Commander, who, in two days
<PB N="291" REF="366">
after they arrived, joined eight &s;ail of bucca|neers more, who were planning another expedi|tion over-land to Panama: but, when they were told of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t, the fatigues they mu&s;t undergo, the ri&s;ks they mu&s;t run, and at length the uncertainty of the event, they una|nimou&s;ly concurred in relinqui&s;hing that de&s;ign, and held a con&s;ultation what other enterprize was fit for &s;uch a formidable body of them to undertake. At length, they concluded to attack a Spani&s;h town up Carpenter's river, and for that purpo&s;e &s;et &s;ail one after another, in order to pre&s;erve &s;ecre&s;y, having previou&s;ly appointed a place of rendezvous. When the &s;hip in which our navigator &s;ailed arrived at the place appoint|ed, they found Captain Wright there before them, who had taken a Spani&s;h Tartan with 30 men, well furni&s;hed with &s;mall arms, and four patararoes, who with 12 armadillos had been fit|ted out to &s;eek the buccaneers, and to &s;ink them. This, they that came over-land, who were hear|tily tired with living among the French, thought a good opportunity to &s;et up for them&s;elves; they therefore applied to Captain Wright, re|que&s;ting him to fit up the Tartan for them; to which, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he con&s;ented, on condition that they &s;hould be under his com|mand as one and the &s;ame &s;hip; to which they made no objection.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> fleet not arriving at the gene|ral rendezvous, according to agreement, it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that the Spani&s;h armadillos [or
<PB N="292" REF="367">
&s;mall men of war] had fallen in with and di&s;|per&s;ed them. Every one, therefore, was at li|berty to pur&s;ue his own enterprize; and Cap|tain Wright with his new a&s;&s;ociates cho&s;e the coa&s;t of Carthagena to try their fortune. Here they were joined by Captain Yankey; and, fall|ing in with a &s;tout &s;hip, they fought and took her. She proved to be a prize of 14 guns and 40 men, laden with &s;ugar and tobacco, and had eight or ten tons of marmalet on board. The Captains differed about the right to the &s;hip. Yankey, however, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by vote of the crews; and Captain Wright took Yankey's &s;hip, which was better than his own. The cargo, after a great deal of difficulty, they di&s;po&s;ed of at a Dutch &s;ettlement for le&s;s than one-fourth of its value.</P>
<P>However, the goods being now converted into ready money, the produce was &s;hared, and the Captains parted. Captain Wright &s;tood for the Caracca coa&s;t, with his men drunk, and quarrel|ling every day; and Captain Yankey pur&s;ued a quite different cour&s;e. On the coa&s;t of the Ca|raccas, Captain Wright took three barks, one la|den with hides, one with European commodities, and a third with earthen-wares and brandy. With the&s;e barks he went to the i&s;land Rocu; and, having divided the cargoes into three equal parts, he gave to every 20 men (for they were 60 in all) one part and a bark, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed them. That in which our navigator had an intere&s;t was brought to Virginia on July 16,
<PB N="293" REF="368">
1682, where we &s;hall leave both him and the &s;hip, to give &s;ome account of Captain Yankey.</P>
<P>On board of Yankey &s;ailed one Mr. Cook, as quarter-ma&s;ter, the &s;econd in command, accord|ing to buccaneer law; and, they having taken a prize from the Spaniards, the command of the prize was claimed by Mr. Cook, on board of which all who cho&s;e to &s;ail under the new Cap|tain had liberty &s;o to do: among others there were &s;everal who came over-land with him from the South Seas (for he too had left Captain Sharpe, and had followed the example of Dam|pier). All the&s;e cho&s;e to follow the fortune of their old acquaintance: but the Frenchmen grudging the Engli&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o fine a ve&s;&s;el, together with their &s;hare of the goods on board her, combined together; and, after plun|dering them of &s;hip, goods, arms, and money, turned them all a-drift on the i&s;land of Vacca. In this de&s;titute condition, Captain Tri&s;trian, of whom mention has already been made, &s;hewed &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion, by taking on board about eight or nine of them, among whom were Capt. Cook and Captain Davis, formerly ma&s;ters of bucca|neers, who, being carried into Petit Guavres, found means, when the French crews were ca|rou&s;ing on &s;hore, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of their benefactor's &s;hip, to &s;lip her cable, and to &s;teer with all the &s;ail they could &s;pread to Vacca to the relief of their &s;tarving countrymen, who, overjoyed to be relea&s;ed, in&s;tantly came on board; and, &s;oon after they &s;et &s;ail, had the
<PB N="294" REF="369">
good fortune to make prize of a &s;hip laden with wine, which was newly come from France. They afterwards fell in with a &s;hip of good force, of which they likewi&s;e made prize; and in her they came to the re&s;olution of &s;ailing into the South Seas, and ranging the coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru. But, fir&s;t, it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;ail to Virginia to di&s;po&s;e of their &s;pare &s;hips and car|goes, and to fit their capital prize for war. This they did by mounting her with 28 guns, and furni&s;hing her with &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the pro&s;ecution of &s;o long a voyage. When the&s;e &s;hips arrived at Virginia, Dampier, and all tho&s;e who came over-land with him, happened to be there; and, being made acquainted with Captain Cook's intention, they very readily agreed to join in his adventure.</P>
<P>And now, having followed Dampier through all the bu&s;y &s;cenes of action in which he was en|gaged, till his 30th year, we come at length to that period, at which the more notable adven|tures of his life commence.</P>
<P>On the 18th of Augu&s;t, 1683, he &s;et &s;ail from Achamack river, in Virginia, in the prize under the command of Captain Cook; and, on the 23d, they met with a violent tempe&s;t, which la&s;ted without intermi&s;&s;ion till the 28th, during which time they &s;hipt &s;ome of the heavie&s;t &s;eas that ever &s;hip endured. But as &s;oon as the &s;torm abated, they had fine weather, and a bri&s;k gale, till they arrived at the i&s;lands of Cape Verd, where they &s;taid to careen their &s;hip, to refre&s;h
<PB N="295" REF="370">
them&s;elves, and to take in fre&s;h water. This they did at the little i&s;land of Sal: but, being told that the i&s;land of Mayo abounded mo&s;t with cattle, they left Sal, and went to Mayo to pur|cha&s;e provi&s;ions. Here they met with a cold reception; the inhabitants ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to have any traffic with them, or to &s;uffer them to land: the rea&s;on was, that about a week before, an Engli&s;h &s;hip pretending friend&s;hip had ca&s;t anchor, and by a &s;hew of kindne&s;s had invited the Governor with his train on board; but, as &s;oon as they had them in their power, they cau&s;|ed them to write for cattle and other provi&s;ions, by way of ran&s;om, to regain their liberty; and, what was &s;till more ba&s;e, after they were furni&s;h|ed with what they required, they carried off their pri&s;oners, who had not then been heard of. Dam|pier afterwards learnt, that the Engli&s;hman who was guilty of this treachery was Captain Bond, who afterwards &s;urrendering him&s;elf to the Spa|niards, entered into their &s;ervice, and taught them to fit out fire-&s;hips, of which they were before to|tally ignorant in the South Seas.</P>
<P>From Mayo they &s;ailed to Sherboro, on the coa&s;t of Africa, where they &s;taid a few days, and purcha&s;ed rice, palm-wines, &s;ugar, honey, and fowls, and then made &s;ail for the &s;traits of Ma|gellan. On the 6th of February, 1684, they came in &s;ight of the &s;traits mouth; but the wind being contrary, they continued their cour&s;e to the &s;outh, and doubled Cape Horn. In latitude 57, when they thought them&s;elves clear of the cape,
<PB N="296" REF="371">
they encountered a &s;torm on the 14th of Fe|bruary, which la&s;ted without abatement till the 3d of March, during which time the rain pour|ed down immoderately for many days; by which, however, they were plentifully &s;upplied with fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>When the &s;torm abated, the wind changed to the &s;outh, and proved very favourable; for at this time they found them&s;elves in lat. 60 deg. S. But, the gale continuing bri&s;k, by the 17th of March they had run to the height of Baldivia, in 48 deg. S. On the 19th, in the morning, they &s;aw a &s;hip to the &s;outhward coming after them with all the &s;ail &s;he could croud. Suppo&s;|ing her to be a Spani&s;h &s;hip from Baldivia and Lima, they lay by for her; but, on her nearer approach, they &s;aw &s;he was an Engli&s;h &s;hip; and, upon hailing her, was told that her Cap|tain's name was Eaton, that &s;he came from London, and was bound for a crui&s;e in the South Seas.</P>
<P>Rogues are always good friends till they come to &s;hare their booty; &s;o the&s;e free-booters agreed to &s;ail together; and accordingly kept company to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, where they both prepared to refre&s;h and refit.</P>
<P>March 22, 1684, they anchored in the &s;outh bay, in 25 fathoms water, not a cable's length from the &s;hore; and as &s;oon as Captain Cook's &s;hip was moored, Dampier was eager to go a&s;hore to look for a <HI>Mo&s;kito-man,</HI> whom they had left in this i&s;land, when they were driven from it in the
<PB N="297" REF="372">
year 1681, by three Spani&s;h men of war, Dam|pier being at that time in the &s;hip commanded by Captain Watling, ju&s;t after Captain Sharpe was di&s;placed. This man, when Captain Wat|ling drew off his crew, happened to be in the woods hunting for goats; and the &s;hip was un|der &s;ail before he came back. Dampier was curious to know whether this Mo&s;kito-man was yet alive; and, if he was, how it had fared with him; and it &s;eemed that the Indian was no le&s;s anxious to enquire after his friends, when he &s;aw that the &s;hips that were approaching were Eng|li&s;h &s;hips. The poor fellow had ob&s;erved them the day before, when fir&s;t they came in &s;ight, and, judging about what time they would come to an anchor, he had killed three goats, and ga|thered greens, ready to dre&s;s as &s;oon as the com|pany &s;hould be at liberty to come on &s;hore. He was already upon the beach before the &s;hips could be well &s;ecured, and was fir&s;t &s;een by one of his countrymen who happened to be on board, and it was no &s;mall plea&s;ure to mark the exce&s;|&s;ive joy of the&s;e two Indians at their meeting. The Mo&s;kito-man belonging to the &s;hip was named <HI>Robin:</HI> he on the i&s;land <HI>Will.</HI> Robin was the fir&s;t who leapt on &s;hore; and, running to Will, threw him&s;elf flat on his face at his feet, who, helping him up, and embracing him, fell flat in like manner with his face at Robin's feet, and was by him taken up and embraced as before. The &s;urprize, the tenderne&s;s, the &s;olemnity of the interview, which was exceed|ingly
<PB N="298" REF="373">
affectionate on both &s;ides, was admired even by the crews of buccaneers, who were &s;pectators from the &s;hips of what pa&s;&s;ed on &s;hore. When Dampier, who was his old friend, came up, <HI>Will</HI> was no le&s;s tran&s;ported with joy to &s;ee him than to meet his countryman, but he expre&s;&s;ed it in quite another manner: other friends too he met with among the crew who knew him, and they were all over-joyed at meeting &s;o unexpectedly; for the&s;e men are very much beloved on board the &s;hips wherever they &s;ail, for their readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in whatever &s;ervice they are put upon. When the ceremonies of congratulation were over, and they had time to make enquiries, he told them, that he was &s;everal times &s;ought after by the Spaniards, who knew that he was left upon the i&s;land; becau&s;e when the &s;hip &s;et &s;ail he was in &s;ight of the &s;hore, and was &s;een by them before he could &s;ecrete him&s;elf: but as he was continually upon the watch, and had di&s;co|vered a &s;afe retreat, they never had been able to find him. He had with him, he &s;aid, his gun and his knife, a &s;mall horn of powder, and a few &s;hot. The&s;e being &s;oon &s;pent, he contrived a way, by notching his knife, to &s;aw the barrel of his gun in &s;mall pieces, with which he made harpoons, lance-heads, hooks, and a long knife; heating the pieces fir&s;t in the fire, which he lighted after the Engli&s;h manner, by &s;triking his gun-flint again&s;t the back of his knife. The iron when it was hot he hammered with &s;tones, and formed it into the various &s;hapes he had occa&s;ion to apply it. By continued la|bour
<PB N="299" REF="374">
and per&s;everance, he had worked him&s;elf &s;uch a complete &s;et of in&s;truments, for killing and catching his provi&s;ions by land and water, as &s;urprized the people when they were brought out for their in&s;pection. But, &s;ays Dampier, it is no more than the&s;e Mo&s;kito-men are accu&s;tomed to do in their own country, where they make their own fi&s;hing and &s;triking in&s;truments, without either forge or anvil: and other Indians are &s;till more ingenious; for they make hatchets of a very hard &s;tone, with which they cut down trees, make canoes, and frame their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Poor Will had built him&s;elf a little hou&s;e about a mile and a half from the &s;hore, which he had made warm and convenient, by lining it with goat-&s;kins. He had likewi&s;e rai&s;ed him&s;elf a couch about two feet above the ground, which he had al&s;o made &s;oft with the fur of the animals he caught, and with the down of the young birds (for he could catch no other) which he occa&s;ionally met with and pluckt. Cloaths he had none; for he had worn them to rags among the bu&s;hes and brambles through which he was often obliged to pur&s;ue his prey. He had been on the i&s;land about three years; and in all that time had never conver&s;ed with any human being. He had &s;een Spaniards; but he always took care, after the fir&s;t, that none of them &s;hould ever &s;ee him.</P>
<P>At this i&s;land the&s;e free booters &s;taid &s;ixteen days; and, on the 8th of April, the two &s;hips &s;et &s;ail together, and pur&s;ued their cour&s;e north|wards
<PB N="300" REF="375">
towards the Line, at the di&s;tance of 12 or 14 leagues from the &s;hore, for fear of being &s;een. The land from 24 deg. to 10 deg. S. is of a mo&s;t prodigious height, with ridges of &s;uch lofty mountains from one end of Peru and Chili to the other, that their &s;ummits &s;eem to ri&s;e above the clouds; and from the &s;ea they appear for ever blue. Dampier attributes to the exce&s;|&s;ive height of the&s;e mountains, the want of great rivers in all this tract; and &s;ays, there &s;eldom falls any rain from 30 deg. to 4 deg. S. He adds, that the limits of the Pacific Ocean ought to be confined within that &s;pace extended we&s;tward indefinitely; for, in all this tract of water, &s;ays he, there are no dark rainy clouds, nor any winds, but trade winds, no tempe&s;ts, no tornadoes, or hurricanes, though north of the Line, they are met with in this Ocean as well as the Atlantic. There is, however, often a thick horizon, &s;o as to hinder an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un with the quadrant; and, &s;ometimes, hazy morn|ings, and thick mi&s;ts, but not &s;uch as will wet one. The rivers in all this tract, he &s;ays, run &s;mall; &s;ometimes they run at one &s;ea&s;on of the year, and at others are quite dry. The&s;e ob&s;er|vations, if ju&s;t, are truly wonderful.</P>
<P>They coa&s;ted along the Pacific Ocean from Juan Fernandez to lat. 9 deg. 40 min. S. without meeting with any thing worthy of note; but, on the 3d of May, they fell in with a &s;hip laden with timber, which they in&s;tantly took without re&s;i&s;tance. From this &s;hip they learnt,
<PB N="301" REF="376">
that the Spaniards were apprized of their being upon their coa&s;ts, and that the Viceroy had &s;ent expre&s;&s;es to all the &s;ea-ports to put the inhabi|tants upon their guard again&s;t any &s;udden attack.</P>
<P>On this intelligence they immediately altered their cour&s;e, and &s;teered for Lobos de la Mer, in lat. 6 deg. 24 min. S. Here they cleared their &s;hips bottoms; and &s;trictly que&s;tioned their pri&s;oners concerning the &s;tate of the country, and which were the towns of greate&s;t note. Se|veral towns were mentioned; but Truxillo ap|peared to be that which, if conquered, would yield the mo&s;t profit: Truxillo was therefore the place agreed upon to make a de&s;cent. In their pa&s;&s;age they de&s;cried three &s;ail: Eaton pur&s;ued two of tho&s;e to &s;eaward; and Cook pre&s;ently made prize of that which was neare&s;t the land. They were &s;hips laden with flour for Panama; in one of which was found a letter from the Viceroy of Lima to the Pre&s;ident of Panama, acquainting him with enemies being upon the coa&s;t, and with the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;trength of their forces. They al&s;o found an image of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin in wood, and a &s;tately mule, being a pre&s;ent to the Pre&s;ident, with &s;even or eight tons of marmalate of quinces, which is eaten as a great delicacy in that country. From the pri&s;oners taken in the&s;e prizes they learned, that the Spaniards were fortifying Truxillo, and that a garri&s;on was already e&s;tabli&s;hed. The attack of that town was therefore judged impracticable; and it was re&s;olved to retire to the Gallapagos
<PB N="302" REF="377">
with the prizes, and there to con&s;ult what next was be&s;t to be undertaken. The Gallapagos are a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands lying on the Equator, very little known or frequented, till the buccaneers found their way into the South Seas; the neare&s;t of them lies 110 leagues to the we&s;tward of the main, in long. 70 deg. W. from England. For the&s;e i&s;lands they &s;et &s;ail on the 29th of May, and reached them on the 31&s;t. Here they found plenty of turtle, which they fea&s;ted upon fre&s;h every day. They &s;taid about ten or twelve days; and laid up about 500 packs of meal from their prizes to &s;erve as a future &s;upply in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Being told by an Indian pri&s;oner that was born at Rio Lexa, that there were great riches in his city, and that he would &s;hew them the way to the place, they concluded to &s;et &s;ail, and to tru&s;t to the fidelity of their Indian guide; intending, however, to anchor by the way at the i&s;land of Cocos, in lat. 5 deg. 40 min. S. to lodge &s;ome of their meal, as more convenient to have re|cour&s;e to on ordinary occa&s;ions than the i&s;lands of Gallapagos. With this intent their &s;toute&s;t meal-&s;hip was taken with them; but, not being able to make the i&s;land, they &s;teered to the continent.</P>
<P>It happened, however, in the cour&s;e of this &s;hort run, that Captain Cook, who had been taken ill at Juan Fernandez, as &s;oon as he came within a few leagues of Cape Blanco, in latitude 9 deg. 56 min. S. &s;uddenly died, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though in the morning, &s;ays Dampier, he was as likely
<PB N="303" REF="378">
to live as he had been for a long time before;" but, he adds, "it is u&s;ual for &s;ick men coming from the &s;ea, to die off as &s;oon as they come within &s;ight of land."</Q> The death of Captain Cook occa&s;ioned a general con&s;ultation, when it was agreed to come to an anchor in Caldera-bay, within a league of Cape Blanco, and there to give him chri&s;tian burial. While the men were employed in digging the grave, three Indians came up to &s;ee what they were about, and en|tered into conver&s;ation with the diggers, at the &s;ame time appearing very &s;hy; but, notwith|&s;tanding their caution, as &s;oon as the corps was decently interred, they were all three &s;eized at once by the company, and very &s;trictly exa|mined. They at fir&s;t pretended to know nothing of the Spaniards; but at length they acknow|ledged that they were &s;ent from Nicoya, a town about 12 leagues off, to learn what they could concerning any &s;trangers that &s;hould touch upon the coa&s;t, the people of that town having advice that enemies were in the adjoining &s;eas, and that therefore it behoved them to be upon their guard. They learnt likewi&s;e from the&s;e Indians, that the inhabitants in that neighbourhood were chiefly hu&s;bandmen, and bred cattle; that they traded in hides, corn, and other provi&s;ions, for which they received in return, &s;hoes, hats, linen, and other cloth; and that, at no great di&s;tance, there were &s;ome very large cattle-pens, where they might furni&s;h them&s;elves with as many buf|faloes as would fill their &s;hips. This was wel|come
<PB N="304" REF="379">
news to &s;ailors, none of whom had ta&s;ted any fre&s;h meat for many weeks; and a company of 24 of them &s;et out immediately with an Indian for their guide, to look for the cattle-pens.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort march of between three and four miles, they came in &s;ight of a &s;avannah, where a great number of cattle were grazing; of which, &s;ome were for in&s;tantly killing as many as they could carry away, while others were for &s;taying all night, and driving them into the pens to &s;upply the &s;hips at once, before the owners were apprized of their de&s;ign. This re&s;olution prevailed; but Dampier, who was of the party, and who never cho&s;e to run unnece&s;&s;ary hazards, returned to the &s;hips with about half the com|pany, together with the Indian guide, while the re&s;t cho&s;e to &s;tay where they were. In the morn|ing, when the&s;e voluntary drovers were expect|ed to return with their cattle, none came: it was therefore feared that &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter had be|fallen them; and boats were manned, and &s;ent out to look for them.</P>
<P>As the boats were rowing along, &s;ome of the company happened to &s;py a number of people upon a rock up to their middles in water; and, upon nearing them, they &s;oon &s;aw that they were the very people they were in &s;earch of; and, therefore, ha&s;tened to take them on board. Lucky it was, that the boatmen happened to &s;py them ju&s;t as they did, for in an hour more they had been all &s;wallowed up by the tide. They had been &s;uffered to &s;leep all night unmole&s;ted;

<FIGURE>

<PB N="305" REF="381">
and in the morning when they were &s;cattered about among the cattle, and driving them into the pens, they were &s;urprized by the &s;udden ap|pearance of about 60 Spani&s;h &s;oldiers well arm|ed, who placed them&s;elves in a convenient &s;itu|ation to cut off their retreat. Alarmed at this unexpected di&s;covery, they ha&s;tened to join in a body, re&s;olving to &s;ell their lives dear, if they found it impo&s;&s;ible to make their e&s;cape. Ac|cordingly, they looked well round them in order to di&s;cover an opening to &s;ome other part of the &s;hore, than that again&s;t which their &s;hips rode, marching at the &s;ame time in as good order as their &s;ituation would admit, and giving the Spa|niards now-and-then a volley of &s;hot, to keep them at a proper di&s;tance. The Spaniards, who are not over eager to come to a clo&s;e engage|ment, kept them&s;elves &s;heltered behind the bu&s;hes, whi&s;tling &s;ome random &s;hot at the fugi|tives, by way of return; which, however, did them no harm. In this cautious manner they advanced &s;lowly towards the beach where Cap|tain Cook was buried; and, looking for their boat, &s;aw her in flames by the water-&s;ide, near the &s;pot where they had grounded her the night before. All hope of retreat being now cut off; and the Spaniards, to make &s;ure of their &s;urren|der, having po&s;ted them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to prevent all communication with the &s;hips, they were at length reduced to the la&s;t extre|mity; when, fortunately, &s;pying a rock ju&s;t above water, about 100 yards from the &s;hore,
<PB N="306" REF="382">
they all determined to commit them&s;elves to the mercy of the ocean, rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards. With this re&s;olution they ru&s;hed together into the tide, holding fa&s;t by one another, and determining that if one pe|ri&s;hed all &s;hould peri&s;h. In this manner they made good their landing upon the rock, where they had continued &s;even hours, when they hap|pened to be di&s;covered by their comrades, who were &s;uffered by the Spaniards to relea&s;e them without firing a gun.</P>
<P>After this di&s;appointment it was thought ad|vi&s;eable not to hazard a &s;econd attempt; they therefore weighed anchor, and continued their cour&s;e to Ria Lexa, having fir&s;t cho&s;en Mr. Ed|ward Davis, the next in command to Captain Cook, Commander in his room. On the 20th of July they &s;et &s;ail, and in three days they were a-brea&s;t of their intended port.</P>
<P>Ria Lexa is known by a high-peaked vol|cano, which &s;mokes all the day, and in the night &s;ometimes &s;ends forth flames of fire. It lies a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the main, and before you approach the town there is a &s;mall i&s;land on which the Spaniards had placed a guard. This guard the buccaneers &s;urprized; but from them they learnt, that the town was &s;trongly fortified; that the Governor was informed of their being upon the coa&s;t; and that the garri|&s;on was well provided for defence. This news di&s;couraged the adventurers, who did not come to fight but to plunder: they therefore in&s;tantly
<PB N="307" REF="383">
withdrew from Ria Lexa, and &s;teering for the gulph of Amapalla, they there careened their &s;hips, and parted company. This gulph is a large arm of the &s;ea running ten leagues up into the country. On the &s;outh point lies Cape Cawina, and on the N. W. St. Michael's Mount, in lat. 12 deg. 40 min. N. But before they came to the gulph, it was agreed that Captain Davis &s;hould go before with two canoes well-manned, in order, by &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ome of the natives, to gain intelligence. Accordingly, as &s;oon as they approached the gulph, the canoes departed, and Captain Davis, the fir&s;t night, arrived at a &s;mall i&s;land on which there was a town called Mangera, which, for want of a guide, he could not find. In the morning he found it; but the Indian inhabitants had all fled, and left the place de&s;erted; only the padre, with two boys to attend him, were left to take their fate. As all that Captain Davis wanted was a pri&s;oner for the &s;ake of information, one more intelligent than the friar could not have fallen into his hands. From him they learnt, that there were &s;everal Indian villages in the gulph; but that there were only three towns that had churches; that, he &s;erved all the three; that there was only a|nother white man, be&s;ides him&s;elf, in the whole gulph, who was a kind of &s;ecretary to the Spa|ni&s;h government, and who collected the reve|nues and kept the accompts.</P>
<P>Captain Davis, upon receiving this intelli|gence, taking with him the friar and his two
<PB N="308" REF="384">
boys, ventured to approach Amapalla, which &s;tands upon an eminence. As Davis with his men gained the a&s;cent, the Secretary, attend|ed by the Ca&s;ique or Indian Chief, demand|ing, in Spani&s;h, who they were, and from whence they came, was an&s;wered by Davis, that they were Bi&s;cayers, and that they were &s;ent thither by the King of Spain to clear the &s;eas from enemies; that their &s;hips were foul, and were coming there to clean; and that he was come before to prepare a convenient &s;tation, and to demand a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Maje&s;ty's In|dian &s;ubjects. The Secretary bid him welcome; &s;aid he loved an Old Spain man; and gave him and his followers a kind invitation to come and take their re&s;idence in the town. Captain Davis a&s;cended the hill, placing the friar in the front. They were received with every po&s;&s;ible mark of re&s;pect both by the Secretary and the Indian inhabitants, and after the fir&s;t &s;alutations were pa&s;t, they were conducted to the church, where all bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature is tran&s;acted. Ac|cordingly, the friar entered fir&s;t and was follow|ed by Captain Davis and mo&s;t of the by-&s;tand|ers; but one or two or the Indians loitering behind were pu&s;hed in by Davis's men, who then, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome mi&s;chief, &s;prung back again, and all the re&s;t of the Indians taking the alarm, followed their example, leaving Davis and the friar, looking at one another in high con&s;ternation, ignorant as po&s;ts of the cau&s;e that had occa&s;ioned the de&s;ertion, while, at the &s;ame
<PB N="309" REF="385">
time, the brutes who had cau&s;ed the revolt were firing upon the poor Indians for flying, and in the &s;kirmi&s;h the Secretary was kill'd upon the &s;pot, the only per&s;on in all the gulph that could &s;peak Spani&s;h, the friar and his two boys excepted.</P>
<P>Davis's de&s;ign was, when they were all in the church, to have &s;hut them in, and made his own terms with them: but, poor wretches! there was no need to practice farther treachery with them; for, notwith&s;tanding the brutality of the&s;e pretended Bi&s;cayers, the Indians &s;hew|ed them every kind of civility, helped them to repair their &s;hips, hewed down timber for them, and brought it to the docks; furni&s;hed them with cattle and fre&s;h provi&s;ions from the main; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in filling water, and carrying wood aboard. All this while the friar with his two lads were kept pri&s;oners, and it was feared, when they were ready to &s;ail, that they would have carried them off; for the Indians had a great veneration for their prie&s;t. He had learned their language, and was very u&s;eful to them both by his kind offices and admonitions.</P>
<P>They remained here from the latter end of July till the 3d of September, when they &s;et the friar and his youths on &s;hore; and, the two Captains, or more properly the two crews, having quarrelled, they parted, as has already been &s;aid, and each of them pur&s;ued a different cour&s;e. Davis &s;teered along the main of Peru, till having ranged the whole coa&s;t of South America, they came to the i&s;land of Plata, in
<PB N="310" REF="386">
lat. 1 deg. 10 min. S. &s;o called by the Spaniards, after Drake had &s;hared the plunder of the Ca|cafuego upon it. Captain Eaton &s;teered a con|trary cour&s;e, till being in want of water, he cho&s;e the i&s;land of Plate to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities. Here the two &s;hips came unexpectedly to the &s;ame harbour, when Captain Eaton propo&s;ed a reconciliation, which Davis, or rather his crew, rejected. Capt. Eaton's men reported, that they had met in their cour&s;e with dreadful tornadoes, with thunder and lightning frightful to the la&s;t degree; that the air &s;melt of &s;ulphur; and that they every moment expected to be involved in &s;moke and flame. Captain Eaton's terms being rejected, he &s;taid but one night, and the day fol|lowing Davis left the i&s;land, and attempted the little town of Manta, about &s;even or eight leagues from Plata. They found the place de&s;erted, and brought away an old woman, the only liv|ing creature they found in the place. She in|formed them, that a great many &s;trangers were come over-land from the north &s;eas; that they were yet in canoes and periagoes; and that the Viceroy had commanded all the Spani&s;h trading &s;hips on the coa&s;t to be burnt, to prevent their falling into the enemies hands. On this news, Davis retired again to the i&s;land of Plata, to wait the event, where &s;oon after an Engli&s;h &s;hip arrived, called the Cygnet, commanded by Captain Swan. This &s;hip had been fitted out by &s;ome merchants of London, with a view to trade; but all trade being effectually at a &s;top,
<PB N="311" REF="387">
Swan was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to put his goods up to auction among the adventurers with whom he ac|cidentally fell in; to man his &s;hip with them; and to turn buccaneer him&s;elf. The new comers were headed by a Captain Harris, who contented him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent to command a &s;mall bark under Captain Swan. There was great joy at this meeting; and Captain Davis and Captain Swan were, like other rogues, very fond of each other for their own villainous purpo&s;es. They now wi&s;hed for Captain Eaton again, that having men enough they might all unite, and undertake &s;ome place of con&s;equence. With this view they fitted up a &s;mall bark, and di&s;|patched her in pur&s;uit of him, appointing a place of rendezvous, if the bark &s;hould be for|tunate enough to meet with him. In the mean time they &s;et &s;ail, directing their cour&s;e to Payta, a &s;mall town in lat. 5 deg. 15 min. S. built un|der a rock near the &s;ea-&s;ide. In their way they fell in with a large &s;hip of 400 tons, laden with timber, by whom they received intelligence, that the Viceroy had ordered 10 frigates to be fitted up with all expedition, in order to drive them out of tho&s;e &s;eas. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Captain Davis's un&s;ettled crew, &s;ays Dampier, began now heartily to repent their not accepting of Captain Eaton's terms."</Q> However, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e, and on the 3d of November landed in the road of Payta, and next morning attempted the town, which they found de&s;erted, and not &s;o much as one day's provi&s;ions left in the whole place.
<PB N="312" REF="388">
Here they got intelligence, that Captain Eaton had burnt a &s;hip in that road the week before, and was &s;ailed to the we&s;tward; by which they judged that he had taken his departure for the Ea&s;t Indies, by which cour&s;e it was always his intention to return home. They, therefore, be|gan to prepare for their defence, in ca&s;e of being attacked by the Spani&s;h frigates. They burnt Captain Harris's bark, becau&s;e &s;he was a heavy &s;ailor, and fitted up another &s;mall bark for a fire-&s;hip; and, having examined their powder and ammunition, and overhauled their rigging, and put every thing in the be&s;t order they could, they made &s;ail for the i&s;les of Lobos. At Lobos they found a letter left by the bark that was &s;ent in que&s;t of Captain Eaton, acquainting them that he had been there, but had &s;ailed &s;ome days before the arrival of the bark; and that the bark was gone to Plata, the place of rendezvous. Here it was concerted to attempt the town of Guaiaquil, before they returned to Plata. Ac|cordingly, on the 29th in the morning, they &s;et &s;ail from Lobos, &s;teering directly for the bay of Guaiaquil. This bay runs in between Cape Blanco on the &s;outh &s;ide, and Point Shan|day on the north, 25 leagues from Cape Blanco. In the bottom of this bay lies the i&s;land of San|ta Clara, in the form of a corp&s;e laid out in a &s;hroud, of which the ea&s;t end repre&s;ents the head, and the we&s;t end the feet. Ships that are bound to the port of Guaiaquil keep to the &s;outhward of this i&s;le, to avoid the &s;hoals on
<PB N="313" REF="389">
the north &s;ide, where, it is reported, a very rich wreck lies &s;unk, and that a per&s;on, who came from the King of Spain with a patent to fi&s;h for wrecks, had taken up &s;ome of the plate, but he dying, the patent expired without much ef|fect. The Indians, however, have taken &s;ome by &s;tealth, and would probably have got much more but for the &s;warms of cat-fi&s;h that hover round this i&s;land, the prick of who&s;e fins is &s;o poi&s;onous. that whenever they draw blood the wound proves mortal. From Santa Clara to Puna Arona is about &s;even leagues, on which i&s;land the inhabitants, who are all &s;eamen or fi&s;hermen, are obliged to keep con&s;tant watch, and to give notice to the Governor of Guiaquil of the approach of all &s;hipping, whether friends or foes. The hou&s;es in the town of Puna &s;tand upon po&s;ts 10 or 12 feet high, with ladders on the out&s;ides to a&s;cend the rooms. Dampier &s;ays, he never &s;aw any &s;uch in any other part of the world, except among the Malayans in the Ea&s;t Indies. They are thatched with pal|meto leaves, and their chambers well boarded, in which they exceed the Malayans. From Puna to Guiaquil is &s;even leagues, and at the di&s;tance of one league from the entrance of the river, which ri&s;es about two miles on the other &s;ide Guiaquil, it is divided into two &s;treams, one &s;tream leading to Leon, the other to Guiaquil. Guiaquil, according to Dampier, is one of the principal &s;ea-ports in the South Seas. The com|modities exported from that city are cocoa,
<PB N="314" REF="390">
hides, tallow, &s;ar&s;aparilla and other drugs, and woollen-cloth, commonly called Quito-cloth. This cloth, which is made at the rich inland town of Quito, is worn by all the common peo|ple throughout the kingdom of Peru. But, be|&s;ides cloth, Quito abounds with gold, wa&s;h'd down from the mountains that &s;urround it, which the Indians make a trade of gathering in the adjacent brooks, where it is &s;ometimes found in &s;olid lumps, but generally in &s;mall du&s;t mix'd with &s;and.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hips entered the bay they ca&s;t anchor off Cape Blanco; and the crews manned their boats and &s;mall barks to advance with the more &s;ecre&s;y towards the town. In their way they made prize of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, laden with Quito-cloth, the ma&s;ter of which told them of the watch at Puna; and at the &s;ame time ac|quainted them that three &s;hips were expected to &s;ail from Guiaquil next tide with 1000 negro &s;laves. They had not rowed far before they fell in with one of the &s;hips laden with negroes, and took her. They cut her main-ma&s;t down, and left her at anchor. The next day they made prize of the other two; but in taking them they alarmed the town: and, there being no di&s;cipline ob&s;erved, no Commander in Chief to lead them on in a body, one party counteracted the other party; &s;o that none of their attacks took place. Captain Davis advanced with a party of his men till they were quite exhau&s;ted in marching thro' &s;wamps and mangroves. Captain Swan and mo&s;t of his men were for retreating, &s;eeing the
<PB N="315" REF="391">
town alarmed; but, being upbraided with cow|ardice, agreed to proceed. They had two In|dian guides; and one of them undertook to lead the way into the town, and was followed by a Davis's man, who was fa&s;tened to him by a rope, to prevent his making his e&s;cape. But, a little before they came within mu&s;ket-&s;hot, Davis's man, who had boa&s;ted of his courage, and &s;ought the po&s;t of honour, to be next man to the guide, cut the &s;tring, and let the guide loo&s;e; who, finding him&s;elf at liberty, took to his heels, and made his e&s;cape. The other, when he &s;aw him out of reach, cried out, that &s;omebody had cut the &s;tring, and that the guide was gone. This &s;pread a general panic; &s;o the de&s;ign was all at once defeated; for, after that, not a man would advance a &s;tep farther, but all retired to their boats and embarked without either firing a gun, or having a gun fired at them. After look|ing at the town for half an hour, they departed: and, having dre&s;t a cow, and filled their bellies, they fell down the bay with the tide, rifled the negro-&s;hips, and took about forty of the &s;toute&s;t men along with them, and turned the re&s;t adrift. Dampier remarks upon this mi&s;carriage, that there never was a fairer opportunity for men to enrich them&s;elves than they had, but all their golden dreams vani&s;hed at once; and they return|ed as they went, directing their cour&s;e to Plata, to meet the bark &s;ent in &s;earch of Captain Eaton.</P>
<P>When they arrived, they found her with her crew almo&s;t fami&s;hed; for having &s;ought the
<PB N="316" REF="392">
&s;hips at Lobos, and from Lobos to Plata, and from Plata to Lobos again, without finding them, and having &s;carce 14 days provi&s;ions on board when they &s;et out, they were con&s;trained to make a de&s;cent upon the village of Santa Helena, where they &s;ucceeded, and got a &s;mall quantity of maize, with which and the turtle they happened to &s;trike, and &s;ome boobies and pen|guins they killed, they had made &s;hift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, though with the utmo&s;t difficulty. Such was the regard the&s;e plunderers bore for each other, when projects of robbery were in view. Here the cargo of the cloth-bark, the only booty they had made, was &s;hared by lots, and Captain Swan had the bark to &s;erve him as a tender. Here al&s;o, according to cu&s;tom, they quarrelled; Captain Davis's men placing the mi&s;carriage to the cow|ardice of Captain Swan's; and Captain Swan's to the over-forwardne&s;s of Captain Davis's. At length the matter was compromi&s;ed by the me|diation of the two Commanders; and they agreed in the next place to attack Lavelia, a pretty large town in the bay of Panama, about &s;even leagues from the &s;ea-&s;ide, on the banks of a river on the north-&s;ide of the bay.</P>
<P>On this expedition they &s;et &s;ail the 23d of De|cember, 1684. On the 28th, they arrived at a &s;mall village called Tomaco, which they &s;urpriz|ed and took, and in it a Spani&s;h Knight, Don Di|ego de Pinas, who came in a Ship from Lima to load timber, in which &s;hip there were only eight Spaniards, and twelve or thirteen jars of good old wine. The wine they &s;eized, but let the &s;hip go.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="393">On the 1&s;t of January, 1685, in pa&s;&s;ing from Tomaco to Gallo they took a packet boat from Panama to Lima with letters. The Spaniards threw the letters over-board; but there being a &s;tring and a &s;mall buoy to the box in which they were inclo&s;ed, the box was &s;een and taken up. The contents of the public di&s;patches were, that the armada from Old Spain were arrived at Porto Bello, and that the Pre&s;ident of Panama had received orders to ha&s;ten the Plate fleet from Lima.</P>
<P>This was joyful news for the buccaneers, who now thought of nothing but &s;haring the trea|&s;ures of Peru. They laid a&s;ide their pitiful project upon Lavelia, and concluded to careen their &s;hips at the King's I&s;les, near the entrance of the gulph of Panama, to which gulph no &s;hips could &s;ail without being &s;een from the&s;e i&s;les. There were now two &s;hips and three barks in company, a fire-&s;hip, and two &s;mall tenders. They all changed their cour&s;e, and &s;teered for the i&s;les, in their way to which they took a &s;hip of 90 tons, laden with flour. On the 23d of January they arrived at the place appointed; and on the 25th, they ca&s;t anchor in the harbour of Galleria, &s;etting all hands to work to clean the barks, in order to crui&s;e in the channel till the next &s;pring-tide, when the large &s;hips might be laid up to be cleaned al&s;o.</P>
<P>On the 27th, the barks, being fini&s;hed, were &s;ent to crui&s;e in the entrance of the gulph; and on the 4th day after, they brought in a prize
<PB N="318" REF="394">
laden with corn, &s;alt-beef, and fowls. The beef and fowls came in good time. The 14th of February, they made an end of careening their large &s;hips, took in wood and water, and, on the 15th, &s;ailed into the channel, to crui&s;e for the plate-fleet. When they came a-brea&s;t of Old Panama, they &s;ent their Knight upon his parole with a letter to the Pre&s;ident, to treat for the ex|change of pri&s;oners; but by &s;ome accident, &s;ays Dampier, he was killed. The next day they &s;ent another letter to the Pre&s;ident by a <HI>Me&s;ti&s;o</HI> (a mixed breed, half Indian half Spaniard). This letter produced the de&s;ired effect. The Engli&s;h pri&s;oners were relea&s;ed, and about 40 Spaniards were returned in their room.</P>
<P>Leaving Panama, they ca&s;t anchor before To|bago; and, while they lay in that road, a &s;tra|tagem was played upon them that was near proving fatal to men and &s;hips. A pretended merchant from Panama came by &s;tealth to trade with them for &s;uch merchandize as they might have on board (a thing not uncommon on tho&s;e coa&s;ts), and was well received. It was agreed, that in the night he &s;hould &s;end his bark out with &s;uch commodities as they wanted, and take back &s;uch as they had to return. Accordingly, the bargain was made, and the bark came out as was expected, hailing the &s;hips with the watch-word that was to be her &s;ecurity. Being cau|tious, however, le&s;t &s;ome mi&s;chief &s;hould be in|tended, they called to the people on board the bark to ca&s;t anchor; which they not regarding,
<PB N="319" REF="395">
were in&s;tantly fired at; upon which the crew took to their canoes, and &s;et fire to the pretend|ed &s;muggling &s;hip, which had been prepared as a fire-&s;hip by that Capt. Bond who carried off the officers from Mayo, as has been already re|lated in the beginning of the voyage. This was aimed chiefly at Captain Davis's &s;hip; but at the &s;ame time, Captain Swan's people ob&s;erved a &s;mall float on the water with &s;omething like a man in it, making towards their &s;hip; the man, &s;eeing he was di&s;covered, dived, and the float di&s;appeared: this, they apprehended, when they &s;aw the fire-&s;hip blow up, was &s;ome com|bu&s;tible matter intended to be &s;truck to the rudder of Swan's &s;hip, as was formerly attempt|ed upon that of Captain Sharpe's in the harbour of Coquimbo. Both &s;hips, however, were glad to cut their cables, and it was with difficulty that Davis's e&s;caped. The fire-&s;hip drove burn|ing towards Tobago, but after the fir&s;t explo|&s;ion &s;he did not burn clear, only made a &s;mother, not being properly contrived.</P>
<P>This Bond, who in&s;tructed the Spaniards in making her, after he left the Cape de Verd i&s;les, as has already been related, &s;teered for the South Seas, and in his pa&s;&s;age meeting with Captain Eaton, Bond's pilot, Richard Morton by name, per&s;uaded him to join with Eaton and to make the voyage conjointly; but after they had &s;ailed in company two days, Morton took an opportunity to &s;lip on board Eaton, and per&s;uaded him to drop Bond, which
<PB N="320" REF="396">
he did in the night, Morton &s;till continuing on board with Eaton. Bond being thus de&s;erted, and having no navigator with him who had ever been in the South Seas, and having been &s;couted for mal-practices in the North Seas, had no other re&s;ource but that of betraying his coun|trymen's de&s;igns to ingratiate him&s;elf with the Spaniards. With this view he &s;teered directly for Porto Bello, &s;urrendered him&s;elf and crew to the Governor, informing him of the buc|caneer's de&s;igns in the South Seas, and offering to remain him&s;elf as &s;urety for the truth of what he &s;aid. The Governor, not doubting the fact, entertained him, and &s;ent him over to the Viceroy of Lima to be employed by him as he &s;hould think fit; and he proved a very u&s;eful in&s;trument in defeating the enterprizes of his old companions.</P>
<P>But to proceed. In the morning when it was light, the &s;hips returned to their buoys to fi&s;h up their anchors; and while they were thus em|ployed, they were alarmed by a multitude of canoes and periagoes that were in motion all round the i&s;land. They &s;eemed to make direct|ly towards the &s;hips, and when they came with|in call, the people on board learnt that they were a new company of Engli&s;h and French in|vaders, ju&s;t arrived from the North Seas to try their fortune along with the old, and were headed by two captains, one Grenet, the other Lequie; that they con&s;i&s;ted of 200 French and the re&s;t Engli&s;h; and that 180 Engli&s;h more
<PB N="321" REF="397">
were &s;till on the i&s;thmus, under the command of Captain Townley, and were daily expected to arrive in order to join the re&s;t. All the Eng|li&s;hmen were immediately taken on board Cap|tain Davis and Captain Swan; and the French were accommodated with the flour prizes, of which mention has already been made, and Cap|tain Grenet, as the elde&s;t officer, was made choice of to command his countrymen. In a few days, Captain Townley arrived, having al|ready made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of two &s;hips, one laden with flour, the other with wine, brandy, and oil: the pri&s;oners they took in the&s;e &s;hips declared, that the fleet from Lima was ready to &s;ail. Soon after the arrival of Capt. Townley, there came a canoe out of the river of Santa Martha, who &s;aid there were 300 men more on the i&s;thmus of Darien in their way to the&s;e &s;eas. On the 15th, they fell in with a bark with five or &s;ix Engli&s;hmen in her that belong|ed to Captain Knight, who had been &s;ix months in the South Seas, and was now upon the coa&s;t of Mexico, where he came in &s;ight of this bark, but not being able to come up with her in his &s;hip, had &s;ent the men that were found in her in a canoe to make prize of her; who, having &s;ucceeded, had lo&s;t company in the night, and could not recover their &s;hip again. This bark Captain Swan took under his care, on pretence that the men had run away and left their Commander, and gave her to Captain Harris, who pre&s;ently manned her.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="398">The time approached when the Lima fleet was expected, and &s;ome letters were intercepted that contained the in&s;tructions to the com|manders which cour&s;e to &s;teer. In con&s;equence whereof the captains of the buccaneers held a con&s;ultation in what manner to &s;teer in order to intercept them; but, while they were yet un|determined, word was brought that the Spani&s;h fleet was advancing, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to give them battle. This news was by no means agreeable. Such a motley crew of com|mon plunderers were but ill &s;uited to &s;tand a regular engagement. However, there was now no alternative, either they mu&s;t fight or run a|way; in which ca&s;e, being taken &s;ingly, they probably would all be de&s;troyed; but by fight|ing &s;ome might chance to e&s;cape. The Spa|niards were 14 in number; of which the Ad|miral carried 40 guns and 540 men; the Vice-admiral 40 guns, 400 men; the Rear-admiral 36 guns, 360 men; one &s;hip of 24 guns, 300 men; one of 18 guns, 250 men; and one of eight guns, 200 men; two fire-&s;hips; &s;ix &s;hips with only &s;mall arms, &s;ome periagoes and ten|ders, having eight hundred men among them all.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, who were to engage this formi|dable &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ted of ten &s;ail; Captain Davis's &s;hip, of 36 guns, 156 men, mo&s;tly Eng|li&s;h; Captain Swan, 16 guns. 140 men, all Engli&s;h; the&s;e were the only &s;hips of force; the others being furni&s;hed with none but &s;mall
<PB N="323" REF="399">
arms; Captain Townley had 110 men, all Eng|li&s;h; Captain Grenet 308 men, all French; Captain Harris 100 men, mo&s;t Engli&s;h; Cap|tain Branley 36 men, &s;ome Engli&s;h, &s;ome French; Davis's tender, eight men; Swan's tender, eight men; Townley's bark, eighty men; and a &s;mall bark of thirty tons made into a fire-&s;hip, with a canoe's crew in her; in all 960 men. The Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of the enemy, re&s;olved to begin the attack, having the advantage of the weather gage, which gave them the choice either to fight or run. Accordingly, about three in the after|noon, they bore down right before the wind on the enemy, who kept clo&s;e upon a wind to meet them; but night came on without any thing material being done on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>When it grew dark, the Spani&s;h Admiral put forth a light as a &s;ignal for the fleet to ca&s;t anchor, and pre&s;ently hoi&s;ted a light on his top, which after continuing there an hour was taken down, and in a little time hoi&s;ted again. The Engli&s;h, being &s;till to windward, were not aware of this &s;tratagem; for the Spaniard, knowing of what con&s;equence it was to gain the weather gage, hoi&s;ted the &s;econd light upon the topma&s;t of one of his barks, and edged away &s;ilently him&s;elf, followed by his capital &s;hips, and, as &s;oon as it was day-light, appeared to wind|ward of the Engli&s;h. This was an unexpected &s;troke, and left them no other cour&s;e to take but to fly.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="400">Captain Townley being hard pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, made a bold pu&s;h through a narrow gut that parted the i&s;les, and was followed by &s;eve|ral of the &s;maller &s;hips, by which they e&s;caped. Captain Harris was chaced to the we&s;tward, and returned no more. And Captain Davis main|tained a running fight all day round the bay of Panama, with the lo&s;s only of a &s;ingle man. At night the Spaniards gave over the pur&s;uit, and &s;uffered the Engli&s;h to rendezvous at the &s;ame i&s;lands from whence they &s;ailed the day before to begin the attack.</P>
<P>The 30th, the Spaniards, without pur&s;uing their victory, continued their cour&s;e to Panama; and the Engli&s;h having lo&s;t Captain Harris in the engagement, as has ju&s;t now been mention|ed, &s;et &s;ail to the keys of Quibo in &s;earch of him, that being the place appointed to rendezvous in ca&s;e of being di&s;per&s;ed. Here they ca&s;hiered their cowardly French Captain, who never came into the engagement at all; and, having found Captain Harris, they held a con&s;ultation about their futu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e operations.</P>
<P>All their hopes being now fru&s;trated of effect|ing any thing con&s;iderable by &s;ea, they turned their thoughts on making their fortunes by land; and for that purpo&s;e their pri&s;oners were all &s;trictly examined, with regard to the &s;trength and riches of the principal cities along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and within 20 or 30 miles within land.</P>
<P>On the 5th of July they were joined by Captain Knight, of whom mention has already
<PB N="325" REF="401">
been made. He had been crui&s;ing more than &s;ix months, and had got nothing except a good &s;hip. He expected to have found the fleet at King's I&s;lands, enriched with the trea&s;ures of the Spani&s;h fleet: but when he came there, he was informed by the ma&s;ter of a bark-log, which he took, that they were wor&s;ted, and had fled to the we&s;tward, where he had now come to join them.</P>
<P>In order more effectually to pur&s;ue their inland enterprizes, they &s;et about providing canoes for navigating the rivers that led to the chief ci|ties, again&s;t which they had formed de&s;igns, and on the 20th of July they &s;ailed from Qui|bo, bending their cour&s;e for Ria Lexa, the neare&s;t port to Leon, the city they determined fir&s;t to attack. Their whole force con&s;i&s;ted of 640 men in eight &s;hips, commanded by the Captains Davis, Swan, Townley, and Knight, with a fire-&s;hip and three tenders.</P>
<P>Being arrived within eight leagues of the &s;hore, they quitted their &s;hips, and embarked to the number of 520 men in 31 canoes; and after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age, in which they met with two dreadful tornadoes, and in which the large canoes were very near &s;inking, they arrived at length at the creek that leads to Leon, and ad|vancing within five miles of the city without the lo&s;s of a man, they landed to the number of 470, leaving the remainder under the com|mand of Dampier to guard the canoes.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="402">They marched from the boats in three divi|&s;ions. Captain Townley with 80 of the bri&s;ke&s;t men led the van; Captain Swan with 100 men followed next, to &s;upport him; Captain Davis headed the main body, con&s;i&s;ting of 170 men, and Captain Knight with the remainder, compo&s;|ed the rear. Captain Townley, who had advanced more than two miles a-head of the re&s;t, met a party of Spani&s;h hor&s;emen, and defeated them. Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, his men pu&s;hed bri&s;kly on, and entered the town, driving all be|fore them. When they had gained the high-&s;treet they were oppo&s;ed by the main body of the Spaniards, drawn up on the parade in or|der of battle; but, on two or three of their principal officers being killed, they were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed; and Captain Townley had made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city before the foremo&s;t divi|&s;ion that was to &s;upport him had entered the &s;uburbs. About &s;ix in the evening the rear|guard came &s;traggling in; many of the men who compo&s;ed it, being tired and unable to keep pace with the re&s;t, came dropping in all night; and one old man was killed next morning by the Spaniards, from whom he refu&s;ed to accept of quarter. He fired his piece among them, re|&s;erving his pi&s;tols to defend him&s;elf when he &s;hould come to clo&s;e engagement; but they re|turned his fire, and &s;hot him dead at a di&s;tance. He was a &s;tout grey-headed old man, aged about 84, and had &s;erved under Oliver in the time of the Iri&s;h Rebellion; after which, he entered on
<PB N="327" REF="403">
board a &s;hip, and &s;ailed to Jamaica, where he had followed buccaneering for many years. He could not be prevailed on to tarry with the ca|noes, but &s;aid he would venture as far as the bolde&s;t man among them. He was much re|gretted, being a cheerful old man, and never di&s;pirited.</P>
<P>The Spaniards likewi&s;e picked up another &s;traggler, one Mr. Smith, a merchant, who had accompanied Capt. Swan with an intent to trade, when that gentleman took in his cargo at London for the South Seas. This gentleman was car|ried before the Governor of Leon, who was en|camped at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town, and was examined by him concerning the number of the invaders. Being known to a Mulatto &s;ervant that attended the Governor, he was the more ea&s;ily credited; when he told him, that they were 1000 &s;trong in the town, and that 500 were left to guard the canoes. This information had its effect; for the Governor, who was a&s;&s;embling the force of the country to fall upon the a&s;&s;ail|ants, &s;ent next day a flag of truce, with an offer to ran&s;om the city. They demanded 300,000 pieces of eight, and provi&s;ions for 1000 men for four months. The demand, it is probable, exceeded the Governor's abilities; &s;o that he was obliged to &s;uffer the city to be &s;et on fire, becau&s;e he could not comply with their exor|bitant demands. In the mean time, Mr. Smith being exchanged for a lady that had fallen into the hands of the invaders, and a Spani&s;h gentle|man
<PB N="328" REF="404">
relea&s;ed, upon promi&s;e of &s;ending them 150 oxen to Ria Lexa, the next town they in|tended to a&s;&s;ault, they left Leon in flames, and returned to their canoes. It does not appear that the plunder of Leon an&s;wered the expecta|tions of the a&s;&s;ailants. Be that as it may, they prowled down the river, &s;tealing cattle, or any thing that fell in their way; and, on the 16th of June, reached Ria Lexa, in the harbour of which the &s;hips were already arrived. The Spaniards, for their better defence, had thrown up an intrenchment at the mouth of a narrow creek leading to the town, and had placed 110 &s;oldiers to defend it; they had be&s;ides thrown a boom acro&s;s the river, to prevent either &s;hips or boats from advancing up the channel: &s;o that the&s;e men might have maintained their po&s;ts again&s;t an army of 500 regulars. But when the Engli&s;h came in &s;ight of the brea&s;t-work, they fired but two guns before the Spaniards run away. They were about half an hour in cut|ting the boom; and, the channel being now clear, they entered the town without farther op|po&s;ition. Here they found nothing but empty hou&s;es, except &s;uch things as the inhabitants could not, or would not carry away; the&s;e were about 500 &s;acks of flour, &s;ome pitch, tar, and cordage, all which, though things of little value to the Spaniards, were notwith&s;tanding of great u&s;e to them. They therefore conveyed them aboard the &s;hips; and having here received the 150 beeves (the ran&s;om of the gentleman re|lea&s;ed
<PB N="329" REF="405">
on his parole at Leon), &s;ome were em|ployed in killing and &s;alting, while others made excur&s;ions to the neighbouring farms and &s;ugar-works, from whence they rarely returned empty handed.</P>
<P>They &s;taid here from the 17th to the 24th, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when &s;ome of our de&s;tructive crew (to u&s;e Dampier's own words) &s;et fire to the hou&s;es, I know not by who&s;e order, but we marched away, and left them burning."</Q></P>
<P>The 25th, the Captains Davis and Swan agreed to part company. They had hitherto been un|&s;ucce&s;sful in concert; they therefore determined to try their fortunes &s;eparately. Knight and Harris accompanied Davis; and Townley with his two barks followed Captain Swan.</P>
<P>In a few days Davis &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;ts of Peru; but Capt. Swan, after &s;taying to take in wood and water, and to recover his men, pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, intending fir&s;t to ex|amine the country of Mexico towards the north, and then to &s;teer for the Ea&s;t-Indies, and by that cour&s;e to return home. This was a very flatter|ing voyage for Dampier, who was no le&s;s earne&s;t to &s;tore his mind with the knowledge of new countries, than to enlarge his fortune by the riches they contained: he therefore quitted Da|vis, and entered on board with Captain Swan.</P>
<P>On the 3d of September they &s;et their pri&s;on|ers and pilots on &s;hore; the latter being of no farther u&s;e, and the former only an incumbrance. A malignant fever continued to rage on board,
<PB N="330" REF="406">
which carried off many of their men. As the &s;ame di&s;temper broke out in the fleet of Captain Davis, it was concluded that they had taken the infection at Ria Lexa, where, a few months be|fore their arrival, the inhabitants had been vi|&s;ited by a kind of plague, which had almo&s;t de|populated the town. They had &s;till, however, about 340 men in tolerable health in four &s;hips.</P>
<P>In their cour&s;e to the north-we&s;tward, they met with mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous weather, violent torna|does from the north-ea&s;t almo&s;t every day, with &s;uch fla&s;hes of lightning and claps of thunder, as no man on board had ever heard.</P>
<P>On the 14th they came in &s;ight of the well-known volcano of Guatimala, which appears at fir&s;t with a double peak. Between the&s;e peaks fire and &s;moke with dreadful roarings fre|quently break forth, and &s;pread the alarm far and wide; yet the inhabitants of Guatimala con|tinue to re&s;ide near the foot of the mountain, and are not &s;o much intimidated upon tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions as tho&s;e who live at a greater di&s;tance. This city is famous for many rich commodities, the produce of the neighbouring hills and &s;a|vannas among which it is &s;ituated. It lies about eight leagues from the South Sea, and by report not above 40 or fifty leagues from the north, to which it &s;ends annually great quantities of in|dico, anatta, &s;ilve&s;ter, and cochineal. The in|dico plant grows wild about Guatimala, and has lately been introduced and cultivated in Georgia and Carolina. The anatta is a red dye, and is
<PB N="331" REF="407">
made from the flowers of a &s;hrub which grows in many of the &s;outhern provinces of America. Silve&s;ter is the &s;eeds of a fruit not unlike the prickly pear of England; and cochineal is a col|lection of in&s;ects bred in fruit of the &s;ame &s;hape and &s;ize. Both the trees grow wild about Gua|timala; and both the &s;ilve&s;ter and cochineal yield the &s;ame kind of dye, and are &s;ometimes &s;ub&s;tituted one for the other, though the cochi|neal is generally accounted the mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>The volcano of Guatimala is &s;een at 75 miles di&s;tance; and the &s;ea, as they approached it, was full of floating pumice &s;tones, wa&s;hed by the rains from the adjacent hills, and precipitated by the floods into the main ocean, where, by a con&s;tant accumulation, they cover an immen&s;e &s;pace. Driftwood they likewi&s;e ob&s;erved in great abun|dance; and the trees were large and not much rotted.</P>
<P>When they had reached the latitude of Toguan|tabeque, in 14 deg. 30 min. N. Capt. Town|ley, with 106 men in nine canoes, attempted to land; but found the country defended by huge &s;andy hills, again&s;t which the waves beat high with incredible fury. The wind being fair, he coa&s;ted along the &s;hore for &s;everal days, and the &s;hips continued to follow him with an ea&s;y &s;ail: at length, grown de&s;perate, he ru&s;hed upon a &s;andy beach, but the canoes over&s;et before they could reach the land. In this attempt one or two men peri&s;hed; &s;ome had a leg or an arm broke, and others were very much hurt. How|ever, the majority having made good their landing,
<PB N="332" REF="408">
dragged afterwards their boats on &s;hore; but what gave them the greate&s;t concern was, that all but tho&s;e who had been provident enough to &s;eal up their cartouch boxes, had wetted their powder, and rendered their fire-arms u&s;ele&s;s. This gave a damp to their enterprize; yet they prepared to penetrate the country, and to get &s;ight of the town of which they were in &s;earch: but either there was no &s;uch place, or their fears prevented their di&s;covering it; for all that were alive returned on board the &s;hips without pro|curing a meal's provi&s;ions to refre&s;h the &s;ick.</P>
<P>After this fruitle&s;s expedition, they &s;till con|tinued coa&s;ting to the we&s;tward, with the wind at ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, till they came to Tangola, a &s;mall i&s;land where there was good anchorage; from thence they &s;ailed to Guatulco, a &s;ea port in lat. 15 deg. 30 min. N. the be&s;t in Mexico. On one &s;ide of the entrance into this harbour there is a &s;mall i&s;land, and on the other a hollow rock, through which the billows as they pa&s;s produce a horrible roaring, and, being com|pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the &s;ides, are forced through a hole at the top, and ri&s;e like the waters of an ar|tificial fountain to an incredible height. In this harbour there is good anchorage. It is about three miles in depth and one in breadth, runs in north-we&s;t, and on the we&s;t-&s;ide &s;mall &s;hips may ride land-locked &s;ecure from wind or weather. At the bottom of this harbour, Drake found a fine rivulet of water, near a village, of which hardly any traces remained, except the ruins of
<PB N="333" REF="409">
a &s;mall chapel enclo&s;ed in a fine grove of trees that gave it a very venerable appearance. Here the &s;ick on board the &s;hips were brought a&s;hore; and here a project was formed to traver&s;e the country, and plunder the inland towns; but, after travelling 14 miles, and &s;eizing two or three Indian guides, they could only find a little vil|lage, where &s;ome vanellos were drying, the cods of which are held in great e&s;teem by the Spa|niards. They grow upon vines that creep like ivy about trees of greater magnitude, and flou|ri&s;h in the bay of Campeachy, as well as in the country of Guatalco; but the Indians keep the method of curing them a &s;ecret to them&s;elves. The Indians of this village could &s;peak but little Spani&s;h, appeared to be a poor harmle&s;s people, had neither gold nor &s;ilver among them, nor could they tell where tho&s;e precious metals were to be obtained. It was therefore to no purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue their march through a country, rich, indeed, in natural productions, but de&s;titute of cultivation, and almo&s;t without inhabi|tants; they therefore returned to their &s;hips; and, while the &s;ick were endeavouring to regain their &s;trength, the healthy employed them&s;elves in providing nece&s;&s;aries to continue the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 8th, four canoes well manned &s;et for|wards to the port of Angels, with orders to wait there till the arrival of the &s;hips. In the mean time their in&s;tructions were to take &s;ome pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="410">On the 12th, the malignity of the di&s;temper with which they had been long afflicted being abated, and the &s;ick in a fair way of recovery, the &s;hips &s;et &s;ail in order to follow the boats. The boats, however, had mi&s;taken the harbour, and two of them, in attempting to land at a place near which they had ob&s;erved &s;ome cattle feeding, were over&s;et in the beach, and with dif|ficulty got out again to &s;ea, with the lo&s;s of one man drowned, and &s;ome others hurt. They lo&s;t likewi&s;e four of their guns, and &s;poiled their am|munition; and, in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, the next day met the &s;hips. The other two ca|noes parted from them in the night of the 9th, and had not rejoined them &s;ince. The harbour of Port Angels lies in latitude 15 deg. N. and is open to all winds, except tho&s;e from the land. The Spaniards had compared it to that of Gua|tulco; but there being no &s;imilitude, the boats had pa&s;&s;ed it without knowing it; and the two that were mi&s;&s;ing had rowed as far as Acapulco before they di&s;covered their mi&s;take. When the &s;hips arrived before the harbour, the mi&s;&s;ing boats were ready to join them; and there ap|pearing to be plenty of cattle at no great di&s;|tance from the &s;hore, 100 men were landed to &s;upply the &s;hips with beef.</P>
<P>The country round this harbour exhibited a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect; the hills were covered with large and lofty trees, the plains with a mo&s;t beautiful verdure, and the &s;avannas inter&s;per&s;ed with rills and rivers, on the banks of which were
<PB N="335" REF="411">
innumerable little &s;hrubs, the beauty and variety of who&s;e flowers &s;urpa&s;s de&s;cription. Here they made no doubt of being furni&s;hed with whatever their wants required. In le&s;s than four miles march, the party that were landed met with a grazing &s;eat belonging to Don Diego de la Ro&s;a, in which they found &s;tore of &s;alt, and a con&s;i|derable quantity of maize, but no inhabitants, the family having fled on the fir&s;t appearance of a de&s;cent. They found al&s;o poultry in abun|dance, and hogs or cabritos without number. Here they fea&s;ted for two or three days, and every man brought away as much as he could carry; but the ruggedne&s;s of the road, and the weakne&s;s of the company, debilitated by &s;ick|ne&s;s, prevented their improving &s;o favourable an opportunity to the be&s;t advantage. They relinqui&s;hed with reluctance many good things which they had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, more than &s;uffi|cient for pre&s;ent enjoyment, but too cumber&s;ome to be conveyed to the &s;hips for future u&s;e.</P>
<P>In the harbour of Port Angels there is good riding in 13, 20, and 30 fathom water. The flood ri&s;es about five feet, &s;ets to the north-ea&s;t; and the ebb at &s;ouch-we&s;t.</P>
<P>The 27th in the morning they &s;et &s;ail from Port Angels, and in the evening came to an an|chor in 16 fathom water, under a &s;mall rocky i&s;land &s;ix leagues to the we&s;tward of their for|mer &s;tation, of which i&s;land the Spani&s;h books give no account. The next day they weighed and continued their cour&s;e; and, being a-brea&s;t
<PB N="336" REF="412">
of a &s;mall lagune whence the mi&s;&s;ing boats had a few days before taken a quantity of fi&s;h, they lay to, and &s;ent in a boat with 12 men to bring off a more ample &s;upply. The Spaniards, on marking the trim of the &s;hips, &s;u&s;pected their intent; and, concealing them&s;elves behind a rock at the narrow entrance of the lagune, di&s;|charged a volley of &s;mall arms at the boat ju&s;t as it pa&s;&s;ed the place of their ambu&s;cade, by which five of the crew were dangerou&s;ly wound|ed. Alarmed at this &s;udden attack, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to retreat, becau&s;e of the narrow|ne&s;s of the channel, they pu&s;hed forwards into the lagune, where they could lie out of gun-&s;hot till the enemy di&s;per&s;ed, or till they &s;hould be relieved by the vigilance and valour of their own people. In this &s;ituation, however, they continued two days and three nights; till at length Captain Townley, fearing &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter had befallen them, manned his canoes, and, beat|ing the Spaniards from the rocks, opened the &s;ufferers a free pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ea. Their joy was the greater, as the pains of the wounded men began to grow intolerable; and, had they not then been relieved, they mu&s;t in another day, nay, &s;ome of them, perhaps, in a few hours, have died in the greate&s;t agonies. This lagune lies in latitude 16 deg. 40 min. N.</P>
<P>On the 2d of November they pa&s;&s;ed by a re|markable rock, called by the Spaniards the Al|gatro&s;s; five or &s;ix miles to the we&s;tward of which are &s;even or eight white cliffs that &s;erve
<PB N="337" REF="413">
to direct mariners to avoid a dangerous &s;hoal &s;tretching about a league and a half &s;outh-by-we&s;t. A little farther to the we&s;tward the Spa|niards have erected a brea&s;t-work upon a &s;mall i&s;land at the mouth of a fair river, which at that time was defended by 200 men. They manned their boats, and being determined to land, the Spaniards, after firing 20 or 30 &s;hot, de&s;erted the i&s;land, and left the channel open. They entered on the we&s;t &s;ide, and found plenty of &s;alt laid up in cabbins for curing the fi&s;h which they catch in the lagunes, but in what manner Dampier could not conceive, for he neither &s;aw hook, line, net, boat, or canoe. At the di&s;tance of three leagues from the entrance of the river they came to a hou&s;e in which was a Mulatto &s;ervant, who in|formed them, that at Acapulco there was a &s;tout &s;hip from Lima; and that a little higher up the river, there was maize and cattle in abundance, to which place he offered to be their guide.</P>
<P>On this intelligence a contention aro&s;e be|tween the commanders. Captain Townley, who was in want of a better &s;hip, propo&s;ed to &s;ail im|mediately to Acapulco to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that from Lima; but Captain Swan was fir&s;t for procuring provi&s;ions to enable them to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t while they were pur&s;uing the grand object they had in view, that of intercepting the Ma|nilla &s;hip which every year comes con&s;tantly from the Ea&s;t Indies richly laden, and arrives nearly at a certain &s;ea&s;on off the &s;outhermo&s;t point of California in her cour&s;e to Acapulco.
<PB N="338" REF="414">
As que&s;tions of this kind are always decided by numbers among voluntary adventurers, Captain Townley's propo&s;al was not only &s;econded by his own crew, but al&s;o by the greate&s;t part of Captain Swan's. They accordingly returned to the &s;hips with all expedition, and &s;et &s;ail on the 5th, and on the 7th came in &s;ight of the high land of Acapulco, a port ea&s;y to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from all others, by means of three hills, the middlemo&s;t of which ri&s;es like a &s;ugar loaf, and the we&s;termo&s;t of the other two has on its &s;um|mit two hillocks which &s;hew in appearance like two paps. When the &s;hips came to the di&s;tance of about 12 leagues they brought to, and Cap|tain Townley with 140 men embarked on board canoes with a view to &s;eize the Lima &s;hip by &s;urprize, before his own &s;hips &s;hould come in &s;ight.</P>
<P>They had hardly &s;ailed four leagues before there aro&s;e &s;o dreadful a tornado, that tho&s;e on board the &s;hips thought them&s;elves in the utmo&s;t peril of their lives, and every one concluded that the boats mu&s;t peri&s;h. Happily, however, they weathered the &s;torm; but were driven in great di&s;tre&s;s into Port Marquis, a tolerable harbour about a league to the ea&s;tward of Acapulco. Here they &s;taid to dry their cloaths, and refit their furniture, and in the night of the follow|ing day they rowed &s;oftly into Acapulco har|bour; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and, becau&s;e they would not be heard," &s;ays Dampier, "they hauled in their oars, and paddled as &s;oftly as if they had been &s;eeking

manatee. They paddled clo&s;e to the ca&s;tle; then &s;truck over to the town, and found the &s;hip riding between the brea&s;twork and the fort, about 100 yards from each. When they had well viewed her, and con&s;idered the danger of the de&s;ign, they thought it impo&s;|&s;ible to accompli&s;h it; therefore they paddled &s;oftly back again till they were out of com|mand of the forts, and then they attempted to land, but were oppo&s;ed by a company of Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, who fired at them, and kept them at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore till day|light; when, taking a view of the town and ca&s;tle, and not liking their appearance, they returned on board, tired, hungry, and hearti|ly mortified at their di&s;appointment."</Q></P>
<P>Acapulco lies in 17 deg. N. on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the continent of America, famous for its trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, and to Lima; in which trade three &s;hips are annually employed; two of them are &s;o regulated, that each has the ad|vantage of the trade-winds that blow between the Tropics, both in going and returning to their re&s;pective ports. The third is employed in &s;upplying the other two with Spani&s;h goods from Lima, and in bringing to Lima the In|dian merchandize and money brought from Manilla.</P>
<P>On the 11th, the &s;hips &s;ailed from Acapulco, and continued coa&s;ting along the &s;hore to the we&s;tward. Near the &s;ea-&s;ide the land is low, but ri&s;es gradually till within land it appears to

touch the clouds. Though the ground is clean and the anchorage good at a mile from land, yet it is defended by breakers that render the &s;hore inacce&s;&s;ible, except at the utmo&s;t hazard of men's lives. In their pa&s;&s;age, ob&s;erving a clu&s;ter of little round hills a little to the we&s;t|ward of the promontory of Petaplan in 17 deg. 20 min. N. they examined the coa&s;t narrowly, and di&s;covered a &s;mall river, at the entrance of which they landed 170 men, who, after march|ing about 14 miles up the country, came to a wretched Indian village, in which a Mulatto woman and four children were the only living creatures left. The&s;e they brought to the &s;hips; and, by the intelligence they received from the old woman, they proceeded to the har|bour of Chequetan, from whence &s;he conducted them, through a pathle&s;s wood, to a farm-hou&s;e, where they found a caravan of &s;ixty mules lad|en with flour, chocolate, and chee&s;e; all which, together with &s;ome oxen, they brought down to their canoes. The cargo of the caravan they in&s;tantly conveyed on board the &s;hips; but the oxen, with eighteen cows which they afterwards &s;eized without oppo&s;ition, they fir&s;t killed and cured, and, having divided the whole into lots, every &s;hip's crew took their own &s;hare on board.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t they quitted this fortunate har|bour, leaving the Mulatto and her four children to their fate. On the 25th, they pa&s;&s;ed a lofty hill divided into peaks, in lat. 18 deg. 8 min. N.

near which the Spani&s;h maps place a town called Cupan, which however they could not find; af|ter a &s;hort &s;tay in &s;earch of it, they proceeded along the coa&s;t, till on the 28th they came in &s;ight of the volcano of Colima, in lat. 18 deg. 36 min. N. at the foot of which is &s;ituated the rich town of Colima, from whence it takes its name. Of the valley by which this burning mountain is &s;urrounded, the Spaniards give a mo&s;t luxuriant de&s;cription; but our navigators found it ab&s;olutely inacce&s;&s;ible from the &s;ea; for the &s;urf ran &s;o high, and the breakers ap|peared &s;o formidable, that the bolde&s;t of them dur&s;t not attempt it: they therefore very re|luctantly quitted the neighbourhood, and pro|ceeded in que&s;t of Sallagua, the bay of which they di&s;covered in lat. 18 deg. 52 min. N. Here they landed 200 of their be&s;t men, who were op|po&s;ed by a body of Spani&s;h foot, &s;upported by a party of hor&s;e; but, on the fir&s;t charge, the foot gave way, and the hor&s;e &s;oon followed. In the pur&s;uit the Engli&s;h were led into a broad road, and followed it, through a woody and rocky coun|try, to the di&s;tance of four or five leagues, with|out &s;eeing hou&s;e or inhabitants. In their way back they met with two &s;traggling Mulattoes, who told them the road led to the city of Oar|rah four days journey off, and the &s;oldiers whom they had defeated were &s;ent from thence to e&s;|cort the pa&s;&s;engers from India that were expec|ted to land in Sallagua bay, from on board the

Manilla &s;hip that every year touched upon that coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this intelligence, they ha&s;tened to embark; and, &s;etting &s;ail on the 6th of De|cember, &s;teered directly for Cape Corientes, at the height of which they expected to meet their prize. In this pa&s;&s;age, Dampier, who had hi|therto by temperance pre&s;erved his health, was &s;eized with a fever and ague, which at length terminated in a drop&s;ical di&s;order that was very near carrying him off, and which carried off many of the men. The drop&s;y, Dampier &s;ays, is a general di&s;order on this coa&s;t, and the na|tives pretend that the &s;tone of the alligator dried and powdered, and drank in water, is an infal|lible remedy. The &s;ame receipt he found men|tioned in a Mexican almanac; but could find no alligator to give it a trial.</P>
<P>On the 11th of December they came in &s;ight of Cape Corientes. It is of a moderate height, flat and even at top, cloathed with woods, and projecting into the &s;ea in &s;teep cliffs. It is laid down in the Spani&s;h maps in latitude 20 deg. 28 min. N. and longitude 230 deg. 56 min. W. from Teneriff, or in 121 deg. 41 min. W. from the Lizard-point in England.</P>
<P>They were now four &s;hips in company; Cap|tain Swan and his tender, and Captain Townley and his tender. The&s;e were all properly &s;tation|ed to gain intelligence; but, provi&s;ions growing &s;hort, Captain Townley's bark was di&s;patched with 60 men to traver&s;e the coa&s;t to the we&s;t|ward
<PB N="343" REF="420">
of the Cape, in &s;earch of &s;ome town or village where their wants might be &s;upplied. On the 17th the bark returned, being unable to weather the cape, or make any u&s;eful di&s;covery. She had left, however, four canoes with 46 men, who determined to double the cape, or peri&s;h in the attempt.</P>
<P>On the 18th, all the &s;hips quitted their &s;ta|tions, and &s;ailed for the i&s;land of Chametley, about 16 or 18 leagues to the ea&s;tward of the cape, to take in wood and water. On the&s;e i&s;lands live the fi&s;hermen, who, as the Spaniards &s;ay, fi&s;h for the inhabitants of the city of Puri|fication. On the 20th, they anchored between the i&s;lands and the main in five fathom water, clear &s;and. Here they caught plenty of rock-fi&s;h, but &s;aw no inhabitants. On the 21&s;t Captain Town|ley with about 60 men went to an Indian village about &s;even or eight leagues to the we&s;tward, to endeavour to procure provi&s;ions; and next day Captain Swan returned to his &s;tation off the cape. On the 24th, the four canoes who had doubled the cape, returned to the crui&s;ers, and reported, that they had rowed to the bay of the valley of Valderas, or Val d'Iris, and had landed in the garden of the world, where they found fruits of the mo&s;t delicious flavour growing wild in the plains, and where the cattle were feeding at large among the &s;treams of water that flowed mean|dering in the &s;avannas, and lo&s;t their waters among the fine&s;t groves of trees they ever be|held; but when they marched in pur&s;uit of the
<PB N="344" REF="421">
beeves that were every where &s;traying in the vallies, they were &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by a body of Spaniards, who bri&s;kly attacked them, &s;ome on foot, and &s;ome on hor&s;eback. They made a gallant defence, and &s;uddenly retreated into an adjoining wood, where they were followed by the Spani&s;h hor&s;e. The&s;e were armed each with a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and &s;ome of them, be&s;ides their pi&s;tols, had &s;hort guns. The Engli&s;h, being covered by the trees, made u&s;e of their fire-arms with advantage; and, after killing about 17 of the a&s;&s;ailants, and wounding &s;everal others, the re&s;t being un&s;upported by the foot, fled with precipitation. In this &s;kirmi&s;h four Engli&s;h were &s;hot dead, be&s;ides two de&s;perately wound|ed; and, not daring again to attempt the valley, they killed a hor&s;e, and, having &s;atisfied their hunger, they returned to their canoes.</P>
<P>On the 25th, being Chri&s;tmas-day, they crui&s;|ed clo&s;e to the cape, and &s;ent in three of their &s;trikers to kill fi&s;h. In the afternoon they re|turned with three great jew-fi&s;h, which afforded them all a Chri&s;tmas-dinner. Captain Townley on the 28th came to his &s;tation, and brought with him 40 bu&s;hels of maize, which he had &s;eized at an Indian village four or five leagues up the country, and which his men were oblig|ed to carry all that way on their backs.</P>
<P>They crui&s;ed till the 1&s;t of January, 1686, off Corientes, and then &s;teered towards the valley of Valderas, in order to furni&s;h them&s;elves with beef; and before night they anchored in 60 fathom
<PB N="345" REF="422">
water a mile from the &s;hore. The next day they landed, dividing them&s;elves into two parties; one party po&s;ted them&s;elves on the hills to watch the motions of the Spaniards, while the other party traver&s;ed the vallies to kill the cattle. The Spaniards frequently pre&s;ented them&s;elves in companies, but did not dare to come near enough to engage. They continued here till the 7th, in which time they had killed and &s;alt|ed beef enough for two months allowance for their whole company, and, had not their &s;alt failed them they might have &s;tored them&s;elves with much more.</P>
<P>They now gave over all farther expectation of the Manilla &s;hip, it being the general opinion that &s;he had e&s;caped (as they were afterwards a&s;&s;ured &s;he had) while the &s;hips were employed in &s;eek|ing provi&s;ions. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So this de&s;ign failed," &s;ays Dampier, "through Captain Townley's eager|ne&s;s after the Lima &s;hip, which he attempted in Acapulco harbour. For though," adds he, "we took a little flour hard by, yet the &s;ame guide who told us of the Lima &s;hip, would have conducted us where we might have had &s;tore of beef and maize; but in&s;tead thereof we lo&s;t both our time and the opportunity of providing our&s;elves, and &s;o were forced to be victualling when we &s;hould have been cruiz|ing, to the total ruin of the enterprize."</Q></P>
<P>Being now provided with beef in abundance, and having taken in wood and water in propor|tionable quantities, the two commanders, Swan
<PB N="346" REF="423">
and Townley, having &s;eparate views, though united in this one grand object of intercepting the Manilla &s;hip, thought proper to part com|pany, Captain Swan intending to &s;teer we&s;tward, and Captain Townley to return ea&s;tward. Hi|therto a Mo&s;kito chief with three of his men had &s;ailed with Captain Swan, but being now about to depart never more to return to their country, he was de&s;irous of recommending them to the care of Captain Townley, who being bound to the coa&s;t of Peru, might there put them on &s;hore at &s;ome convenient place, from whence they might travel over land to the North Sea. This Captain Townley undertook to per|form; and the &s;hips being now under &s;ail, they &s;aluted each other, and parted.</P>
<P>Our navigator continued to &s;ail with Captain Swan. Before night they pa&s;&s;ed Point Pon|tique, which forms the we&s;ternmo&s;t point of the bay, di&s;tant from Cape Corientes about twenty leagues. This point is in lat. 20 deg. 50 min. N. a league to the we&s;tward of which are two bar|ren i&s;lands, called the i&s;lands of Pontique. Be|yond the&s;e i&s;lands the land trends to the north|ward, pre&s;enting a very rugged unplea&s;ant ap|pearance as far as the eye can extend the pro&s;|pect. On the 14th, they came in &s;ight of a &s;mall white rock in lat. 21 deg. 15 min. N. which at a di&s;tance &s;eemed like a &s;hip under &s;ail. From this i&s;land the land runs &s;till more northerly, and the &s;ea tumbles in with &s;uch vio|lence upon the &s;hore, that for many leagues to|gether
<PB N="347" REF="424">
there is no landing; there is, however, every where good anchoring as far as the i&s;lands of Chametley. The&s;e i&s;lands are &s;ix in number, and different from tho&s;e of the &s;ame name on the ea&s;t of Cape Corientes, being a little within the Tropic of Cancer, and not above three leagues from the main. On the&s;e i&s;lands grows a fruit called the penguin, of which there are two &s;orts, the yellow and the red. The yellow grows on a thick &s;tem about a foot high, the leaves narrow and about half the length of the &s;tem edged with prickles. The fruit grows out from the top of the &s;tem in two or three large clu&s;ters, 16 or 20 in a clu&s;ter. It is round and in &s;ize like a &s;mall pullet's egg; the outer coat is thick and tough, and the pulp in the in|&s;ide is full of little black &s;eeds. The red pen|guin is in &s;hape like a little nine-pin; grows up on &s;tools from the ground in clu&s;ters of 60 or 70 on a &s;tool, &s;tanding upright like the leaves of hou&s;eleek, and are &s;maller than the yellow: they are &s;urrounded by leaves a foot and a half long, edged with prickles like the former. They have a &s;harp pungent ta&s;te, are very whole&s;ome; but tho&s;e who eat of them immoderately find them heating. They grow wild, and in the bay of Campeachy Dampier &s;ays they are &s;o plentiful, that one can hardly range the plains for their prickly leaves.</P>
<P>From the&s;e i&s;lands Captain Swan embarked 100 men in canoes, and went him&s;elf in &s;earch of Coolican, a river in the province of Culla|can,
<PB N="348" REF="425">
with a town of con&s;iderable trade (pro|bably that marked Pa&s;tla in the Spani&s;h maps) upon its banks, the inhabitants whereof pa&s;s in boats to the i&s;land of California and fi&s;h for pearls. They coa&s;ted along the &s;hore as far as lat. 24 deg. N. but found no river; and after three or four days ab&s;ence returned without making any di&s;covery.</P>
<P>A few leagues to the N.N.W. of Chametley is a narrow entrance into a lake, called by the Spa|niards Rio de Sal, which runs about 12 leagues ea&s;terly, parallel with the &s;hore, forming many low mangrove i&s;lands, and having depth of wa|ter every where for boats to row along its banks. In this lake Captain Swan entered, accompanied by 150 of his men in 12 canoes. In his pro|gre&s;s he ob&s;erved a grazing farm, and landing &s;ome of his men, they found the hou&s;e de&s;ert|ed, and the cattle driven away. On proceeding further along the lake, two Indians were &s;een running at &s;ome di&s;tance, whom they took for &s;pies, and having di&s;charged a volley of &s;mall arms, one of them was wounded in the thigh, and not being able to continue his race, was &s;eized by a party landed for that purpo&s;e who brought him on board He informed them, that, about four leagues from the place where they then were, an Indian town was &s;ituated in a &s;avanna, abounding with cattle. The com|pany were &s;carcely landed to go in &s;earch of this town before they were attacked by a body of Spani&s;h hor&s;e, who not being properly armed,
<PB N="349" REF="426">
made but a faint oppo&s;ition, and &s;uddenly re|tired. While the Engli&s;h were in pur&s;uit, the enemy played off a &s;tratagem that greatly an|noyed them. We have already mentioned, in the voyages of Captain Sir Francis Drake, the nature of the gra&s;s that covers the &s;avannas on the i&s;thmus of Darien between the North and the South Seas. Such was the gra&s;s with which the pur&s;uers were &s;urrounded, when the Spaniards &s;et it on fire, and, being dry as &s;tub|ble, it burnt with a&s;toni&s;hing fury, and &s;pread with &s;uch rapidity, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the whole party e&s;caped being involved in the flames. This di&s;a&s;ter not only made them more cautious, but occa&s;ioned a delay, which gave the Spaniards time to collect their force and to make a more formidable oppo&s;ition. When the Engli&s;h arrived the next day at the village of which they had intelligence, they found it occupied by an armed garri&s;on, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to overcome before they could enter; but as the Spaniards were, for the mo&s;t part, de&s;titute of fire-arms, and the Indians wholly unexperienced in their u&s;e, the advan|tage the Engli&s;h derived from that circum|&s;tance &s;oon decided the conte&s;t in their favour. The enemy fled after the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their leaders, and left the conquerors ma&s;ters of the place, having only one man killed with an ar|row, and their &s;urgeon &s;orely wounded.</P>
<P>They were told by their pri&s;oners, that, about five leagues from the town of which they were
<PB N="350" REF="427">
now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, two rich gold mines were wrought by Indian &s;laves belonging to the Spa|niards of Compo&s;tella, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Spani&s;h city in that di&s;trict. It was not now a time to &s;earch for gold, when they were in want of every kind of food, except the beef they had cured at Valderas. Their chief &s;earch was now for maize, and having plundered the vil|lage of all they could find, they conveyed it to their boats with great labour; and next day quitted the lake, and returned on board the &s;hips. This lake is laid down in latitude 23 deg. 30 min. N.</P>
<P>On the 2d of February, Captain Swan made another excur&s;ion with 80 men in &s;earch of the river Ro&s;ario, at the entrance of which they landed, and marched to an Indian town of the &s;ame name. Here they were told, that the gold mines were not above two leagues from the town; but, like the cock in the fable, they re|jected the pearl and cho&s;e the barley-corn; about 90 bu&s;hels of maize, and the other pro|vi&s;ions they found in the place, though in&s;uffi|cient for the purpo&s;e of their intended voyage, were yet of more value in their pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity than all the gold of Compo&s;tella.</P>
<P>On the 3d the &s;hips came to an anchor off the river's mouth of Ro&s;ario, in &s;even fathom water, oozy ground, in lat. 22 deg. 51 min. N.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the Captain with his company came on board. The quantity of provi&s;ions which he had procured was but trifling for &s;o
<PB N="351" REF="428">
many men; he therefore &s;ent the next day a party in &s;earch of the river Oleta, but they re|turned without having found it. The river St. Jago was next attempted, and on the 11th they anchored in &s;even fathom water near the mouth of it, three leagues E. S. E. of the white rock of Maxentelbo, the high hill of Zeli&s;co bearing S. E. This is one of the principal ri|vers upon the coa&s;t, and lies in latitude 22 deg. 15 min. N.</P>
<P>On the 11th, 70 men were &s;ent up the river to make di&s;coveries; they &s;pent two days in ex|amining the creeks and inlets, and at length came to a large field of maize which they had begun to gather, when they &s;pied an Indian who had been &s;ent to watch the corn, whom they &s;eized and carried on board, in hopes of gaining from him &s;ome intelligence, by which they might obtain a more effectual and &s;peedy &s;upply. He told them, there was a town called Santa Pecaque, about four leagues from the place where he was taken, in which there was great &s;tore of provi&s;ions, and to which he un|dertook to be their guide. Captain Swan, over|joyed at the news, ordered 140 men to be in|&s;tantly embarked on board the canoes, and to proceed with the Indian as he &s;hould direct. After rowing five leagues up the river, they came in &s;ight of the town, when they landed in the night, and next morning &s;et out on their march by land. About 10, they had advanced within mu&s;ket-&s;hot; and, having di&s;patched a
<PB N="352" REF="429">
party to reconnoitre, they found the town de|&s;erted, and entered it without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The town of Santa Pecaque is &s;eated near the &s;ide of a wood in a &s;pacious plain, neatly built, with a &s;quare in the middle, on each &s;ide of which the hou&s;es are furni&s;hed with balconies, from whence the inhabitants, in general, are &s;pec|tators of the frequent proce&s;&s;ions exhibited by the Spani&s;h prie&s;ts, in order to convert the In|dians, who are now almo&s;t all become chri&s;tians in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. The town, though &s;mall, has two churches; and they were told, that about 70 white families con&s;tantly re&s;ided in it, be&s;ides tho&s;e who occa&s;ionally came there as carriers from the mines, and as merchants from Compo&s;tella. The&s;e carriers furni&s;h the adjacent miners with maize, &s;ugar, &s;alt, and &s;alt-fi&s;h, of all which there was great plenty in Santa Pecaque.</P>
<P>Captain Swan being acquainted by an expre&s;s with the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, and with the opportunity that now offered to &s;upply his wants, ha&s;tened to the town to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders. When he arrived, he divided his men into two parties; one party he employed in conveying the provi&s;ions to the boats; the other in plundering and packing up. The&s;e he relieved alternately; and when both parties were wearied out with this laborious &s;ervice, they caught hor&s;es, and, having laden them with maize, di&s;patched them under a &s;trong e&s;cort down to the canoes.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="430">On the 17th, when they arrived, they found the men who guarded the canoes in high &s;pirits, though they had been attacked by the Spa|niards, and had one man de&s;perately wounded. The party that e&s;corted the hor&s;es thought it advi&s;eable, however, to reinforce the canoe-guard, left the Spaniards &s;hould renew the attack. Next day they returned to the town, and the party left therein were preparing to con|voy more maize to the canoes; but, before they &s;et out, Captain Swan under&s;tood by an Indian whom they had made pri&s;oner, that 1000 men were in arms in order to attack them, and that they were already advanced within three leagues of the place. Upon this intelligence, the Cap|tain advi&s;ed all his men to load as much maize as they could altogether bear away, and in&s;tantly to depart in a body. With this advice they ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed to comply, being determined not to leave Santa Pecaque, while a load of provi|&s;ions remained within it. It was in vain to en|deavour to per&s;uade tho&s;e whom he could not puni&s;h for di&s;obeying orders; and, therefore, on the 19th, he &s;uffered 50 of them to depart with as many loaded hor&s;es; exhorting them, however, to march in a body, that they might be the better able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t any &s;udden &s;urprize. They were equally deaf to advice and in&s;truction; they pur&s;ued their old cour&s;e, marching in a line, and every one lead|ing a &s;ingle hor&s;e. The Spaniards had remark|ed their manner of marching, and had placed
<PB N="354" REF="431">
them&s;elves in ambu&s;h the preceding night. They had &s;carce travelled half a league before they were &s;uddenly &s;et upon, and every man cut to pieces before they could a&s;&s;emble to prepare for their defence. Captain Swan, who had heard the firing, ha&s;tened with his party to the place of action; but on his approach he was &s;truck with horror at the &s;ight of &s;uch a number of his followers weltering in their blood, &s;tript of their arms, and dive&s;ted of their charge. The Spaniards, after the &s;laughter, having po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of their mu&s;quets, &amp;c. &s;eized al&s;o the loaded hor&s;es, and in&s;tantly fled. Though the party commanded by Captain Swan did not exceed the number of tho&s;e already &s;lain, yet they were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted to the canoes, on board of which they embarked, and, with the provi&s;ions they had already &s;ecured, returned to the &s;hips. Among the &s;lain on this occa&s;ion was Mr. Ringro&s;e, who wrote that part of the hi&s;tory of the buccaneers that relates to Captain Sharpe.</P>
<P>The &s;laughter of this unfortunate party dampt the &s;pirits of the &s;urvivors, and di&s;cou|raged them from attempting any farther de&s;cents upon this coa&s;t. Is was therefore determined to &s;teer directly for Cape St. Lucas on the i&s;land of California, where they might lie &s;e|cure from the attacks of the Spaniards, till the men were refre&s;hed, and the &s;hips put in a con|dition to undertake a new voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="432">The lake of California (for &s;o it is called in the Spani&s;h charts) is either very little known to the Spaniards, or very carefully concealed. Though they have mines open already more than they can work, in Mexico, Chili, and Peru, yet they are very unwilling to allow other European powers to &s;hare the trea&s;ures of tho&s;e countries, though they them&s;elves cannot ex|hau&s;t them; nor is it at all likely that any con|&s;iderable advantages will ever be made by others, till by &s;ome lucky chance a nearer pa&s;&s;age in|to tho&s;e &s;eas is di&s;covered. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were I," &s;ays Dampier, "to attempt a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, I would go fir&s;t to the South Seas, bend my cour&s;e from thence along by California, and that way &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age into the We&s;tern Seas. If I &s;ucceeded in my attempt, I &s;hould then be without that dread which others mu&s;t have had of pa&s;&s;ing from a known to an un|known region; and which, it is not impro|bable, obliged them to relinqui&s;h the pur|&s;uit ju&s;t as they were on the point of accom|pli&s;hing their de&s;igns. In like manner," he adds, "were I to be employed in &s;earch of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, I would winter about Japan, Conca, or the north-ea&s;t part of China; and taking the &s;pring and &s;ummer be|fore me, I would make my fir&s;t trial on the coa&s;t of Tartary, wherein if I &s;ucceeded, I &s;hould come into &s;ome known part, and have a great deal of time before me to reach Ar|changel or &s;ome other European harbour."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="433">On the 21&s;t they &s;et &s;ail, directing their cour&s;e for California; but, being oppo&s;ed by con|trary winds, were unable to reach their de&s;tined port, and obliged to put in at the Maria i&s;lands, in latitude 21 deg. 40 min. N. di&s;tant about 40 leagues from Cape St. Lucas, and 20 from Cape Corientes. The&s;e i&s;lands are three in number, and they came to an anchor at the ea&s;t end of the middlemo&s;t in five fathom water, clear &s;and; where, as &s;oon as they moored their &s;hips, they in&s;tantly began to unrig them, in order to careen.</P>
<P>Here Captain Swan propo&s;ed to his company to return home by way of the Ea&s;t Indies, which was highly approved by &s;ome, and as violently oppo&s;ed by others, who, being igno|rant, imagined, as Dampier &s;ays, that he would carry them out of the world. At fir&s;t coming they lived upon nothing but &s;eal; but in two or three days their &s;trikers furni&s;hed them plen|tifully with turtle; and they likewi&s;e killed guanicoes, conies, and large pigeons; &s;o that they con&s;umed none of their &s;hip provi&s;ions, during their &s;tay. While the &s;ailors were working upon the &s;hips, the officers employed them&s;elves in &s;urveying the &s;tores and mea&s;uring the maize; which they divided into three parts, and allotted two parts to the &s;hip, and one part to the bark, the &s;hip carrying one hundred men, the bark only fifty.</P>
<P>Here Dampier, who had been long ill of the drop&s;y, tried a very uncommon remedy. He
<PB N="357" REF="434">
&s;tripped him&s;elf &s;tark naked, laid him&s;elf down upon the hot &s;and, and cau&s;ed the &s;urgeon to cover him all but his head; in this manner he lay near half an hour; but being unable to endure it any longer, he was carried to his tent and put to bed. While he was in the &s;and he &s;weat immoderately, and to that operation he a&s;cribes the recovery of his health.</P>
<P>They &s;taid till the 26th, when their &s;hips being clean, they &s;ailed to the valley of Valderas, in order to take in fre&s;h water. Here they came to an anchor at the mouth of the river where they had anchored before; but, now that the dry &s;ea&s;on prevailed, they found the water bracki&s;h, and unfit for u&s;e. They then weigh|ed, and, coming to a fine fre&s;h-water brook at the foot of a little round hill about four leagues from Cape Corientes, they filled on the 29th 32 tons of excellent water, a quantity &s;ufficient to &s;erve their voyage.</P>
<P>Being provided with every thing they had rea&s;on to expect in this country, they now began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the po&s;&s;ibility of per|forming their intended voyage. Upon a nice calculation, they found they had only 60 days provi&s;ions on board, at a little more than half a pint of maize a-day for each man; they had a great many rats on board, which they could not prevent from con&s;uming a part of the maize; they had, according to the Spani&s;h account, more than 7000 miles to run from Cape Co|rientes to Guam, the neare&s;t land; and, that
<PB N="358" REF="435">
i&s;land being &s;ubject to the Spaniards, they had no certainty of a &s;upply when they came there. All the&s;e di&s;couragements &s;taggered the mo&s;t forward of them; and nothing could prevail with the majority but a promi&s;e from Captain Swan to crui&s;e off Manilla, to intercept the re|gi&s;ter &s;hip, as &s;oon as they &s;hould arrive in the proper &s;tation. To this condition Captain Swan was forced to &s;ubmit, though much again&s;t his inclination; for he had no mind to commence plunderer at fir&s;t; and now he was heartily tired of the trade.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t of March, 1686, they took their departure from Cape Corientes, the Cygnet, Captain Swan, with 100 men; and the bark, Captain Teat, with 50. At fir&s;t they &s;teered with a &s;mall land breeze at E. N. E. which car|ried them three or four leagues; then the &s;ea-wind came on at W. N. W. and changed their cour&s;e S. W. By &s;ix o'clock in the evening they were nine leagues S. W. from the cape. About 10 the next morning they had the &s;ea-breeze at N. N. E. &s;o that at noon they were 30 leagues from the cape. It then blew a fre&s;h gale, which carried them into the true trade-wind. At fir&s;t they had it at N. N. E. and then northerly. At 250 leagues from the &s;hore it &s;ettled at E. N. E. and there &s;tood till they came within 40 leagues of Guam.</P>
<P>After the &s;econd day of their departure, hav|ing fine clear weather, and a fre&s;h trade-wind, they crouded all the &s;ail they could &s;pread, and
<PB N="359" REF="436">
had frequently ob&s;ervations of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars; &s;o that they could calculate their longitudinal di&s;tance by way of amu&s;ement al|mo&s;t every day. At their fir&s;t &s;etting out they &s;teered into the latitude of 13 deg. N. and it is remarkable, that in a run of more than 6700 miles in this latitude, they &s;aw none of tho&s;e &s;mall i&s;lands that are &s;o plentifully inter&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame latitude on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Line; nor did Commodore An&s;on, who after|wards pur&s;ued the &s;ame track from Acapulco, &s;ee land till he arrived at the i&s;land of Tinian. As they run at a great rate, and the wind had every appearance of continuing, after being at &s;ea about 20 days, the men began to grow cla|morous to have their allowance enlarged; with which the Captain was forced to comply, tho' he endeavoured to per&s;uade them to patience, and repre&s;ented to them the danger of being be|calmed, of mi&s;&s;ing their intended port, or of be|ing refu&s;ed a &s;upply when they arrived. But none of the&s;e could prevail. The cry was for an augmentation, and an augmentation they had. Till the 20th of April their allowance was eight &s;poonfuls of boiled maize a man; but after that it was enlarged to ten. Dampier, who, as has been before noticed, had long been troubled with a drop&s;ical di&s;order, gathered &s;trength by this &s;pare regimen; but tho&s;e who were in full health it very much weakened. He &s;ays, he con&s;tantly drank three times a-day; but there were many on board who did not drink once in
<PB N="360" REF="437">
nine or ten days, and &s;ome not in twelve; one in particular did not drink in 17 days, and then &s;aid he was not a-dry, though he made water every day. Amid&s;t the&s;e hard&s;hips one poor fellow was found guilty of theft, and &s;entenced to receive three &s;tripes with a two-inch rope on his bare back from every man in the &s;hip. Cap|tain Swan, Dampier &s;ays, began fir&s;t, and &s;truck with a hearty good will, and his example was fol|lowed by all the re&s;t; a puni&s;hment that mu&s;t make every feeling mind &s;hudder.</P>
<P>Though by the Spani&s;h account the di&s;tance from Cape Corientes to Guam is &s;aid to be 2400 leagues, or 7200 Engli&s;h miles, yet Cap|tain Swan had per&s;uaded his men, that, by the Engli&s;h account the di&s;tance was only 1900 leagues; and that, as Drake and Cavendi&s;h had run it in le&s;s than 50 days each, they with bet|ter built &s;hips might run it even in le&s;s than either of them: when, therefore, they had run the 1900 leagues, and the 50 days were nearly expired, they began to grow very mutinous; and tho&s;e who had declared again&s;t the voyage from the beginning, exclaimed bitterly again&s;t the Captain, and again&s;t all tho&s;e who had per|&s;uaded them to undertake it. They had, during this long run of 6000 miles, &s;een neither fi&s;h, fowl, bird, or in&s;ect, except once when, at the di&s;tance of 4975 miles from Cape Corientes, they &s;pied &s;ome ruabies, which they apprehend|ed had come from i&s;lands or cliffs at no great di&s;tance, though they never came in &s;ight of
<PB N="361" REF="438">
any. The Captain in the mid&s;t of the&s;e tu|mults gave them fair words; told them, that it was probable, the Spani&s;h accounts might be the be&s;t, and encouraged them by giving them hopes, that, as the breeze continued, a few days patience would put an end to their troubles. On the 18th of May they met with &s;ome rain, and the clouds &s;ettling in the we&s;t foretold their near approach to land. On the 20th, the bark being near three leagues a-head, ran over a rocky &s;hoal, on which there was only four fathom water. On the &s;hoal they ob&s;erved abundance of fi&s;h &s;wimming every where about; and Captain Teat imagining that land was near, clapt upon a wind with the bark's head to the north, and lay by to &s;peak with the &s;hip. When the &s;hip came up, Captain Teat went on board, and related what he had &s;een; on which, being then in lat. 12 deg. 55 min. N. and Guam being laid down in 13 deg. N. they clapt on a wind, and &s;teered to the northward, very doubtful, however, of being right, as no &s;hoals near Guam are noticed in the Spani&s;h charts. They pur|&s;ued this cour&s;e, however, till four in the after|noon; when, to their un&s;peakable joy, they &s;aw the i&s;land of Guam at eight leagues di&s;tance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And happy it was, &s;ays Dampier, that we got &s;ight of it before our provi&s;ions were gone, of which we had but enough for three days more; for, as I was afterwards informed, the crew had combined fir&s;t to kill Captain Swan, and eat him, when the victuals were gone;
<PB N="362" REF="439">
and, after him, all of us who were acce&s;&s;ary in promoting the voyage."</Q></P>
<P>Nothing can exhibit a more &s;triking indica|tion of the ferocity of man's nature, than the re&s;olution formed by this abandoned crew. Af|ter a long &s;eries of enormities, robberies, mur|ders, burning of hou&s;es and towns, expo&s;ing their fellow-creatures to want of food and &s;hel|ter, and &s;preading terror and deva&s;tation where-ever they &s;et their feet, they at length, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and half-fami&s;hed them&s;elves, begin to murmur again&s;t their leaders, and the greater number combine to murder the le&s;&s;er number, and to make food of their fle&s;h. Need we, after read|ing this, have recour&s;e to tho&s;e we call barba|rous nations for in&s;tances of the &s;avage nature of man! The mo&s;t uncultivated of tho&s;e eat only the fle&s;h of enemies killed in war; but the&s;e wretches, who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, exceeded in their intention every horrid ex|ample we read of; they con&s;pired to kill and eat their own Chiefs!</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of May they came to an anchor about the middle of the i&s;land of Guam on the we&s;t &s;ide. This is one of the Ladrone i&s;lands. Dampier places it in 13 deg. 21 min. N. and com|putes the meridian di&s;tance of Guam from Cape Corientes to be about 7302 miles; and &s;uppo&s;es the South Sea to be of greater breadth by 25 de|grees than is commonly allowed by hydrogra|phers. It is about twelve leagues in length and four in breadth; on it the Spaniards have a &s;mall
<PB N="363" REF="440">
fort of &s;ix guns, garri&s;oned by 20 or 30 &s;oldiers, and commanded by a Governor, and one or two &s;ubordinate Officers. The climate is healthy, and the natives active, docile, and ingenious, and are the be&s;t boat-builders throughout the Indian &s;eas. Dampier believes their boats &s;ail the be&s;t of any in the world. He tried one of them by the log; and, by the rate &s;he ran in half a minute, computes her cour&s;e at 24 miles within the hour. The&s;e Indians are no le&s;s dex|terous in navigating than in building their boats. By report they will pa&s;s to other i&s;lands at 30 leagues di&s;tance, do bu&s;ine&s;s, and return again in 12 hours.</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner ca&s;t anchor than a Spa|ni&s;h friar came on board, with three Indians: Captain Swan received the prie&s;t with great ci|vility; told him they came with no ho&s;tile in|tention, but as friends to purcha&s;e with their money provi&s;ions to continue their voyage. The prie&s;t replied, that provi&s;ions were now &s;carce upon the i&s;land, but would engage the Gover|nor to do his utmo&s;t to &s;upply their wants. They thought proper, however, to detain the padre till his promi&s;e was fulfilled.</P>
<P>Next day a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent with letters and a pre&s;ent to the Governor, and in the mean time two boats were manned, one to fi&s;h, and another to purcha&s;e cocoa-nuts; the former re|turned empty, but the latter came back laden. The Governor, on the receipt of the letters and pre&s;ent, in token of friend&s;hip complimented
<PB N="364" REF="441">
the Captain with &s;ix hogs, 12 mu&s;k-melons, and as many water-melons; and at the &s;ame time &s;ent an order to the Indians in the neare&s;t town to bake every day as much bread-fruit as the &s;hips &s;hould require, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the mariners in ga|thering cocoa-nuts and other fruits; with which order the Indians very readily complied. Dur|ing this friendly intercour&s;e the Manilla &s;hip came in &s;ight; but, being fir&s;t &s;een from the fort, the Governor found means to apprize her of her danger, and &s;he &s;tood off, and e&s;caped without being di&s;cerned by the &s;hips. But in &s;teering to the &s;outhward to avoid them, &s;he was very near &s;haring a wor&s;e fate; for &s;he &s;truck upon the &s;hoal already mentioned, and, after three days ince&s;&s;ant labour, floated off with the lo&s;s of her rudder. During her di&s;tre&s;s the men got intelligence of her &s;ituation; but Captain Swan, who had determined no longer to follow the infamous employment of plundering, found means to divert them from their purpo&s;e of at|tacking her.</P>
<P>On the 30th of May the Governor &s;ent his la&s;t pre&s;ent to Captain Swan, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome hogs, a jar of pickled mangoes, a jar of excel|lent pickled fi&s;h, a jar of ru&s;k or bread made of fine flour, and &s;ix or &s;even packs of rice. In return, at his own reque&s;t, he was furni&s;hed with powder and &s;hot of which he was in want; but what he coveted mo&s;t was a fine Engli&s;h dog which they had on board, with which he was likewi&s;e gratified. The friar's civility was
<PB N="365" REF="442">
rewarded with a bra&s;s clock, an a&s;trolabe, and a large tele&s;cope; in return for which he &s;ent the Captain &s;ix hogs, &s;ome bu&s;hels of potatoes, a roa&s;ting pig, and half a hundred weight of fina Manilla tobacco. The &s;hips were plenti|fully &s;upplied, be&s;ides, with every thing the i&s;land afforded; cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit as many as the &s;hips could &s;tow, and upwards of 50 hogs in pickle. Captain Swan was de&s;irous of the Governor's letter to the merchants of Manilla, having a private view to trade, which he concealed from his villainous crew.</P>
<P>On the 2d of June, they departed from Guam, directing their cour&s;e to Mindanao, one of the Philippines; a range of i&s;lands extending in length from the 5th to the 19th degree of North latitude, and occupying in breadth about &s;ix degrees of longitude. The principal i&s;land in this range is Luconia on the north, where Magellan, in his voyage round the world, was &s;lain with a poi&s;oned arrow, and where the Spa|niards made their fir&s;t &s;ettlement, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed at Manilla a mart of traffic with the riche&s;t kingdoms of the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh, Mindanao is the principal i&s;land. It is in length about 60 leagues, and in breadth fifty. It is diver&s;ified with hills and vallies. The hills abound with gold, and the vallies are covered with perpetual verdure. It is finely watered with rivers and &s;prings; and the plains and lawns are inter&s;per&s;ed with groves of lofty trees, &s;ome of which are
<PB N="366" REF="443">
formed for &s;hade, and &s;ome afford food for the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Of the pith of one they make their bread, and of the &s;ap of others they make a plea&s;ant drink. The mar&s;hy grounds abound with rice, and on the dry hilly land they cultivate yams, potatoes, melons, and a variety of vegetables unknown to Europeans. Their chief fruits are plantains, bonanoes, nutmegs, cloves, beetel-nuts, durians, jaccas, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and oranges.</P>
<P>The plantain Dampier calls the king of fruit, and prefers it to every other. The tree that bears it is between three and four feet in circumference, and ri&s;es about ten or twelve feet high. When at its height, there &s;prings from the top a &s;tem about the &s;ize of a man's arm, round which the fruit grows in clu&s;ters, in &s;hape not unlike the Turkey cucumber, the coat of which is of a yellow colour when ripe. The inclo&s;ed fruit is of a delicate flavour, and melts in the mouth like mamalet. It is highly e&s;teemed by all Europeans, and all their &s;ettle|ments are furni&s;hed with plantain walks, &s;ome families &s;ub&s;i&s;ting wholly upon that fruit.</P>
<P>The bonanoe differs but little from the plantain, except in &s;ize, being &s;mall and le&s;s lu&s;cious.</P>
<P>The nutmeg and clove trees are rare in this i&s;land, but tho&s;e that grow are large and fine. The natives di&s;courage their growth for fear of exciting the jealou&s;y of the Dutch, who have monopolized the whole trade for &s;pices, and who keep in pay a company of armed &s;oldiers
<PB N="367" REF="444">
to cut down the &s;pice-trees in the uninhabited i&s;lands, le&s;t other European nations &s;hould avail them&s;elves of their plenty. Dampier &s;ays, that he has been a&s;&s;ured that, in &s;ome of the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, it is u&s;ual to &s;ee, at the &s;hedding time, cloves three or four inches deep under the trees.</P>
<P>Of the beetel-nut all the Ea&s;tern people are immoderately fond. It is the fruit of a tree that grows like the cabbage-tree to the height of ten or twelve feet, without either leaf or branch, and then &s;ends forth &s;hoots on every &s;ide, among which the fruit is found in clu&s;ters, on tough &s;talks about the bigne&s;s of a man's finger. It is larger than a nutmeg, and round|er; they cut it, when green, in quarters, wrap|ping each quarter up in an arek-leaf, and chew|ing both together. It ta&s;tes rough, dyes the lips red, and makes the teeth black.</P>
<P>The durian grows on trees like apple-trees, and are in &s;ize as large as pumpkins, covered with a thick rind, which, when ripe, opens and &s;ends forth a &s;trong &s;cent, not unlike that of roa&s;ted onions. It divides into chives, each about the &s;ize of a pullet's egg, the in&s;ide of which is of the con&s;i&s;tence of cream, and mu&s;t be eaten in its prime, or there is no enduring its rankne&s;s.</P>
<P>The jacca differs very little from the durian; only the in&s;ide of the former is yellow, and that of the latter white.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Mindanao abounds likewi&s;e with animals of various kinds; and, according to Dampier, is one of the mo&s;t plentiful i&s;lands
<PB N="368" REF="445">
in the world; and, though &s;o near the Equator, being in 7 deg. N. the air is temperate, enjoy|ing gentle &s;ea-breezes in the day, and cooling land-winds in the night.</P>
<P>Though they arrived on this coa&s;t about the middle of June, yet it was the middle of July before they could come to an anchor. They were ignorant of the &s;ituation of the chief town; and, arriving fir&s;t on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, had been all that time playing about the i&s;land in &s;earch of it. At length they ca&s;t anchor near the river that bears the name of the i&s;land, and leads to the chief city. They fired &s;even guns, and were an&s;wered from the &s;hore by three. They were pre&s;ently after invited by a Raja and one of the Emperor's &s;ons, who demanded in Spa|ni&s;h, who they were, and from whence they came? They were an&s;wered by Mr. Smith (the gentleman made pri&s;oner at Leon), that they were Engli&s;h, and had been long from their country. They were told, they were welcome; and a&s;ked if they were come to &s;ettle a factory, and to open trade? They &s;aid, they came only to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions. At which the Minda|neians appeared di&s;concerted. Captain Swan was &s;ome time at a lo&s;s to account for this cir|cum&s;tance; but he afterwards under&s;tood, that a Captain Goodluck had been there &s;ome time before, with &s;ome propo&s;als from the Ea&s;t-India Company; and that, when he went away, he had given them &s;ome rea&s;on &s;hortly to expect an Am|ba&s;&s;ador from England, to complete the treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="446">The Raja and Prince &s;at in their canoes; and, after half an hour's conver&s;ation, took their leave, having invited Captain Swan a&s;hore, and pro|mi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in procuring provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>There are three &s;mall i&s;lands called Meangis, within 20 leagues of Mindanao, that abound with gold and cloves; and, while Captain Swan was beating along the coa&s;t, in his pa&s;&s;age from Guam to the river where the &s;hips now were at anchor, they were ob&s;erved by the Princes of that country, and known to be Engli&s;h. The Prince of tho&s;e i&s;lands, having heard a good report of the Engli&s;h, and fearing a vi&s;it from the Dutch, &s;ent &s;ecretly his nephew to Captain Swan, to in|vite him and his company to come and &s;ettle in his territories, offering every advantage in point of trade and &s;ecurity that he &s;hould require. Nothing could have been more advantageous, both to the nation and the &s;ettlers than this offer; but Captain Swan paid no regard to it.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on was now approaching when the we&s;terly mon&s;oon was about to &s;et in, which would nece&s;&s;arily oblige the &s;hips to &s;tay a con|&s;iderable time in the port of Mindanao, Captain Swan judged it his intere&s;t to cultivate a good under&s;tanding with the reigning Sultan. With this view he cau&s;ed a magnificent pre&s;ent to be prepared for the Sovereign, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;carlet-cloth, gold lace, a Turki&s;h &s;cymetar enriched with jewels, and a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, together with pre&s;ents of le&s;s value to his chief Mini&s;ters; and, being in readine&s;s, he &s;ent them on &s;hore by
<PB N="370" REF="447">
Mr. More, who &s;ailed with him from London as chief &s;upercargo, when his de&s;ign was to trade in the South Seas. The&s;e pre&s;ents were graciou&s;ly received. The Sultan made Mr. More &s;it down by him, and a&s;ked him many que&s;tions concern|ing England, by means of a Spani&s;h interpreter; and, after an hour's conver&s;ation, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with marks of the highe&s;t e&s;teem. Next day Captain Swan was invited on &s;hore, and admit|ted to an audience in form; when the Sultan &s;hewed him letters from the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany, and de&s;ired to know if he came to &s;ettle in con&s;equence of tho&s;e letters? He talked with him much concerning the produce of his coun|try, and the nature of carrying on commerce; and &s;eemed highly entertained with the accounts he gave of it, and of the countries through which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and the novelties he had &s;een. He was three hours in clo&s;e conver&s;ation; and, when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, was entertained by Raja Laut, the King's uncle, with a &s;umptuous banquet, after their manner, con&s;i&s;ting of boiled rice, fi&s;h, and fowls.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, Captain Swan was given to under&s;tand, that, while Mr. Goodluck re&s;ided in that city, he had been robbed by a &s;ervant be|longing to Raja Laut, and that the fellow ab|&s;conded till Mr. Goodluck took his leave; but that he was now returned, and was ready to be delivered up to be puni&s;hed, in &s;uch manner, and with &s;uch &s;everity, as crimes of the like nature are puni&s;hed by the laws of England. But

</FIGURE>
<PB N="371" REF="449">
Captain Swan told him, that in his country none but the injured party could pro&s;ecute the crimi|nal; and, as the man had committed no offence again&s;t him, he could take no cogni&s;ance of his crime. The Raja heard him with a&s;toni&s;hment; and, to &s;hew that the Princes of Mindanao were far from countenancing &s;uch practices, he cau&s;ed the fellow to be &s;tript naked, tied to a po&s;t, and expo&s;ed a whole day with his face to the burning &s;un; while at the &s;ame time the Mo&s;kitos con|tinually tormented him without a po&s;&s;ibility of being able to bru&s;h them off; a kind of torture that few have hardine&s;s enough to &s;urvive. This conde&s;cen&s;ion, in offering to deliver up the cri|minal to be puni&s;hed by the Captain, was fol|lowed by a like offer from the Captain, with re|&s;pect to any of his men who &s;hould offend again&s;t the laws of the Mindaneians; but the Mini&s;ter returned the compliment, and left the puni&s;h|ment to the Captain him&s;elf, who, upon the lea&s;t complaint, puni&s;hed his men with a &s;everity that &s;hewed more of revenge than of ju&s;tice, and which they afterwards took occa&s;ion to re&s;ent. Among tho&s;e who felt the effects of his indigna|tion was Captain Teat, his chief mate, who com|manded the bark that accompanied him in his run acro&s;s the Southern Ocean; and others, who had offended him on board, he remembered, now he had the countenance of the court on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Captain Swan was highly care&s;&s;ed by the Chiefs of Mindanao, and pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay and
<PB N="372" REF="450">
&s;ecure his &s;hips from the approaching tempe&s;ts, which always attend the change of the mon|&s;oons; and, as the river before the rainy &s;ea&s;on generally runs low, finding it difficult to float his &s;hip over the bar, fifty or &s;ixty Minda|neian fi&s;hermen were immediately &s;ent with their canoes, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in lightening his &s;hip, and floating her up the river. She was no &s;ooner moored than a free intercour&s;e with the natives commenced. They expre&s;&s;ed their regard for the Engli&s;h by &s;igns that were ea&s;ily under&s;tood. When the Dutch were mentioned to them, they would &s;pread their fore-fingers half a foot apart, &s;aying <HI>Bujeto,</HI> they are &s;o far di&s;tant in friend&s;hip: when &s;peaking of the Spaniards, they would &s;pread their fingers &s;till wider; but when the Engli&s;h were &s;poken of, they would bring their fingers quite clo&s;e, &s;aying <HI>Samo,</HI> we are all one. They were very fond of getting the men to their hou&s;es, where they kindly entertained them, after their manner, with tobacco, and beetel-nut; and where tho&s;e who had money, and were decently dre&s;&s;ed, were pre&s;&s;ed to connections with the be&s;t families, and courted by the young females to the mo&s;t familiar intimacy. To men who have long been at &s;ea, &s;uch inducements are irre&s;i&s;|tible; and many of them made them&s;elves poor, by being too ea&s;ily drawn in by the&s;e allurements to &s;pend their money lavi&s;hly. Some who ac|companied Harris from the North Seas had gold in abundance; and the Mindaneian mi&s;&s;es, when they knew their power, very &s;oon found the way
<PB N="373" REF="451">
to ea&s;e them of it. In Mindanao they had gold|&s;miths and other artificers, who charged double their value for &s;uch baubles as the&s;e prodigals were for ever be&s;peaking to pre&s;ent to their fa|vourites; be&s;ides, &s;ome of them bought hou&s;es, and hired &s;ervants, and lived as profu&s;ely as the Raja him&s;elf, imitating the cu&s;tom of the coun|try, and having a pagelly or principal compa|nion, and half a dozen mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. It was not long before the town's people di&s;covered the true humour of Engli&s;h &s;ailors, and they like|wi&s;e took care to make their advantage of it. As they had no other but gold in lumps, when they wanted change, they gave them at the rate of 11 or 12 dollars an ounce. To others the &s;ame gold was exchanged for 18 dollars. The price of provi&s;ions and common nece&s;&s;aries was in like manner enhanced by tho&s;e &s;pendthrifts; and thus, &s;ays Dampier, the poor were made to &s;uffer by the folly of the rich, and a foundation was laid for impo&s;ing upon all Engli&s;hmen who &s;hould hereafter have occa&s;ion to take up their re&s;idence in that port.</P>
<P>Captain Swan him&s;elf was &s;eldom &s;een at any other hou&s;e but Raja Laut's or the royal palace. At the latter he made frequent vi&s;its, and at the former dined every day, attended by &s;uch of his men as had no money to &s;pend, who had rice in plenty provided for them, and &s;ometimes the remains of fowls or pieces of buffalo, dre&s;t in a cour&s;e, and &s;erved in a hoggi&s;h manner. The Mindaneians u&s;e neither knives nor forks in eat|ing,
<PB N="374" REF="452">
and they cram their mouths with lumps as large as they can take in, tho&s;e being accounted the genteele&s;t who can open their mouths the wide&s;t.</P>
<P>The religion of Mindanao is the Mahome|tan, and when the &s;hips fir&s;t ca&s;t anchor, it was their <HI>Ramadam,</HI> which an&s;wers to our Lent, when all &s;ports and pa&s;times are &s;u&s;pended; on this account the Raja made an apology for not entertaining the Captain with the u&s;ual diver|&s;ions of the country. The wet &s;ea&s;on too came on, which cau&s;ed a general &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all out-door bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>During the month of Augu&s;t the weather be|came tempe&s;tuous, and the rains exce&s;&s;ive. The river &s;welled and overflowed its banks; and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the &s;hips were prevented from driving on the main land, or into the open &s;ea; for trees of va&s;t magnitude came floating down with the torrent, and fre|quently pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t their bows with &s;uch weight, that they were in continual fear le&s;t their cables &s;hould give way. During the time of the&s;e inundations the city &s;tands, as it were, in a pond, and there is no communication be|tween hou&s;e and hou&s;e till the floods abate. It was probably this circum&s;tance that &s;ugge&s;ted to them the manner of con&s;tructing their hou&s;es. They are all built upon po&s;ts from 12 to 20 feet high. The&s;e po&s;ts are larger or &s;maller according to the height or magnitude of the &s;uper&s;tructure. The Sultan's palace has but
<PB N="375" REF="453">
one floor, on which, however, there are many rooms, to which they a&s;cend by &s;tairs from the &s;treet. It &s;tands upon 180 po&s;ts, and is twenty feet above the level of the ground. The ordi|nary hou&s;es are al&s;o of one floor, and a&s;cended by ladders. The roofs are all covered with pal|meto leaves. The area beneath their hou&s;es is u&s;ually fenced in, and there the poorer &s;ort keep their poultry; and there al&s;o is received the common draught of their &s;culleries; and, were it not for the frequent inundations that carry off the &s;oil, the na&s;tine&s;s of the meaner people would render living in Mindanao impo&s;&s;ible: but every crevice is &s;coured clean by the vio|lence of the currents, which frequently over&s;et the hou&s;es; though the po&s;ts on which they &s;tand are &s;unk deep in the ground.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Mindanao are, like all the Ea&s;tern people, very clean in their per&s;ons; they con&s;tantly bathe every day once, and &s;ometimes oftener; they wa&s;h after every meal: and, if they happen to touch by accident any unclean thing, they have their times of purification allotted, before the expiration of which they are not per|mitted to leave their chambers. Swine are held with them in abomination, and though they run wild in the woods, yet they are never eaten. The chief food of the people is rice, &s;ago, plantains, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other nutritious fruits; among the better &s;ort, fowls and beef are u&s;ed rather by way of reli&s;h, than as &s;olid
<PB N="376" REF="454">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance; for they are boiled to rags in their &s;trange me&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Mindaneians are of low &s;tature, &s;mall limbs, &s;traight bodies, little heads, and are of a brown copper colour. The women are fairer than the men, and their hair is black and long, and generally well dre&s;&s;ed. Their vi&s;age too is rounder and better featured than that of the men; only their no&s;es are &s;mall, and &s;o flat be|tween their eyes that the ri&s;ing is &s;carce di&s;cer|nible. At a di&s;tance they look tolerable, but on a nearer approach the&s;e imperfections are ra|ther di&s;gu&s;ting. Their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a petti|coat and a loo&s;e jacket. The &s;leeves of the jacket are long and wide at the &s;houlders, but &s;loping down to their wri&s;ts, where they are &s;o tight, that it is with difficulty they get their hands through in putting them on. They then ri&s;e in folds about the arm, and in that lies their pride. The better &s;ort of people wear fine callico or &s;ilks; the meaner &s;ort, an ordinary cloth made of the plantain-tree, which they call &s;aggen. The women, in general, (as has been noted) love the company of &s;trangers, e&s;pecially of white men; and Dampier adds, that the men belonging to the &s;hips could &s;carce walk the &s;treets without being pulled into their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The chief arti&s;ts among them are gold&s;miths, &s;hip-builders, carpenters, and &s;miths; all of whom are excellent in their way, allowing for the badne&s;s of their tools. Dampier gives a de&s;cription of their &s;mith's bellows, which is
<PB N="377" REF="455">
&s;imple and ingenious. It is compo&s;ed of two hollow cylinders, like the large wooden pipes u&s;ed by us for the conveyance of water; they are cut flat at both ends, in length about four feet, and placed upright at the di&s;tance of two feet from each other upon a &s;tone hearth before the fire. Within two inches of the bottom of each a pipe is placed, projecting like a cock to|wards the fire, but bending &s;o as that the pipes from both cylinders meet and terminate in one before they reach it. Thus con&s;tructed, and fixed firm, a man with two light bru&s;hes made of fea|thers, which he works alternately like two pi&s;tons, keeps up a continual bla&s;t; and with this &s;imple contrivance, without either vice or anvil, other than a large &s;tone or the butt-end of an old can|non, they fabricate their work to admiration. Their carpenters have neither &s;aws nor planes, and yet they &s;plit and &s;mooth their boards with great neatne&s;s. This requires time, but their work is the more durable for it, becau&s;e the grain being unbroken the timber remains the tougher.</P>
<P>In Mindanao there is only one mo&s;que, or place of wor&s;hip, and that but little frequented by the meaner people. In this mo&s;que they have a contrivance for &s;triking the time. A drum of va&s;t dimen&s;ions, &s;haped in form of a bell, is placed over a large hollow cavity, the head of which drum is covered with bra&s;s, and called a gong. A certain number of men are appointed to attend this gong, who relieve each
<PB N="378" REF="456">
other alternately night and day, and with a &s;tick as large as a man's arm, with a ball at the end of it, at certain intervals, they &s;trike the gong, the &s;ound of which is heard from one extremity of the town to the other, and &s;upplies the place of a clock.</P>
<P>The Mindaneians u&s;e circumci&s;ion, and that operation is performed with great ceremony. The u&s;ual time among the common people is about the age of twelve; but the Princes of the blood are circumci&s;ed, like the Jews, at the end of eight days. On this occa&s;ion, the warriors all appear in arms, and, like Europeans at a re|view, make a &s;ham fight, for the diver&s;ion of the &s;pectators, in which both the Sultan and his General are principal performers.</P>
<P>When the waters were &s;ub&s;ided, and the Ra|madam over, Raja Laut, the Sultan's brother, and General of his forces, to entertain Captain Swan, a&s;&s;embled the dancers, who are women bred from their infancy, like tho&s;e in Europe, to that art. On this occa&s;ion, more than 50 of them were a&s;&s;embled, who, being ranged in a ring, danced to their own mu&s;ic. In the&s;e dances their feet and legs are but little employed. Having no other than vocal mu&s;ic, they &s;ing at fir&s;t &s;olo parts in &s;low time; but their choru&s;&s;es are bri&s;k; and then their hands, arms, heads, and bodies, are all employed in &s;uch contortions, that one would think they were made without bones.</P>
<P>Dancing and proce&s;&s;ions were the favourite diver&s;ions among the Chiefs of this i&s;land; and,

Captain Swan, in conformity to the prevailing ta&s;te, re&s;olving to give an Engli&s;h entertainment, ordered his mu&s;ic a&s;hore, and &s;uch of his men as could dance were likewi&s;e ordered to attend. Accordingly, having hired a convenient hou&s;e, he invited the Sultan, and Chiefs of the place, with their women, to be &s;pectators of the &s;plen|dor of the European dances. He had cau&s;ed the hou&s;e to be hung round with the riche&s;t &s;ilks, of which he had &s;tore on board; and decorated it with gold and &s;ilver-lace, which, when illumi|nated with a profu&s;ion of wax-candles, made a mo&s;t brilliant appearance. When the company a&s;&s;embled, they were &s;truck with amazement, and thought all they beheld was the effect of en|chantment. Among the dancers, there was one Jack Thacker, a common &s;ailor, who at the mu&s;ic-hou&s;es at Wapping had learned to dance a horn-pipe. This man attracted the notice of the Mindaneians more than all the re&s;t, becau&s;e more in the antic manner to which they were accu&s;tomed. Him, therefore, they fixed their eyes upon, and con&s;idered as a man of con&s;e|quence. When they had &s;pent the be&s;t part of the night in fea&s;ting their eyes and their appe|tites (for Captain Swan had ordered his cook to prepare a cold collation of &s;weet-meats, and other &s;avoury di&s;hes), they were &s;till unwilling to retire; and it was almo&s;t day-break before the Sultan retired, and, very unwillingly, was accompanied by his female train. Raja Laut and his women &s;taid longer; and, it is &s;aid, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="380" REF="458">
his devotion to his prophet, drank plentifully of wine.</P>
<P>Nothing was talked of &s;o much among the Mindaneians, during the &s;tay of the &s;hips, as the comic Engli&s;h dancer, of whom Raja Laut was willing to know the hi&s;tory; and, having en|quired, was told by one of his companions, that he was an Engli&s;h nobleman who travelled for his diver&s;ion, and that all tho&s;e who wore fine cloaths were gentlemen of inferior quality, who left their own country out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee the countries abroad.</P>
<P>This harmle&s;s impo&s;ition, being told by the General to Captain Swan, who was of a moro&s;e un&s;ociable di&s;po&s;ition, co&s;t the poor fellow a hearty drubbing, though he was wholly ignorant of what had been told. He was fir&s;t &s;tript of his fine cloaths, in the pre&s;ence of the Raja, by his Captain's orders, and then &s;tript of his nobi|lity by flogging his back. It was not long, however, before the man was revenged.</P>
<P>About the middle of November they began to prepare for their departure, and for that purpo&s;e their fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to examine the &s;hips bot|toms, the &s;heathing of which they found eaten by the worm like a honey-comb; and the bot|tom of the bark not being &s;heathed, was eaten to the timbers, and the ve&s;&s;el thereby rendered un|&s;erviceable: application was therefore made to the Raja for planks to new &s;heathe the &s;hip. The Raja's &s;incerity was never &s;u&s;pected, till this incident gave rea&s;on for jealou&s;y. When he
<PB N="381" REF="459">
came down to the river, and &s;aw the carpenters ripping off the &s;heathing, he &s;hook his head, and &s;eemed much di&s;concerted, declaring he had never before &s;een a &s;hip with two bottoms. His hope was, that the &s;hip, like the bark, would have been eaten through, and that he &s;hould have had all her guns. A like accident had for|merly entitled him to a like advantage, when a Dutch &s;hip, by anchoring in the &s;ame river dur|ing the we&s;terly mon&s;oon, was entirely di&s;abled, and never again put to &s;ea. He was &s;en&s;ible enough of the mi&s;chief that would infallibly en|&s;ue to the &s;hips by lying &s;o long among tho&s;e de&s;tructive vermin; for, whenever the natives di&s;u&s;e their ve&s;&s;els, they haul them up on the dry beach, burn their bottoms, and there let them lie, till they want again to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>While &s;ome were employed in ripping off the old worm-eaten planks, others were bu&s;y in pre|paring new; and, by the beginning of Decem|ber, the &s;heathing was repaired and tallowed. The latter part of the month was taken up in putting the balla&s;t, &s;tores, and guns aboard: this was a work of the greater labour, as it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to carry the &s;hip out to &s;ea before it was undertaken. About the beginning of January they began to fill water, and to take in rice; and application was made to Raja Laut to furni&s;h buffaloes, as he had all along promi&s;ed to do. He now began to form excu&s;es, and pretended to take men out every day a-hunting (for tho&s;e creatures always run wild); but al|ways
<PB N="382" REF="460">
came home empty, and pleaded ill &s;ucce&s;s. The Captain too began to act very my&s;teriou&s;ly. By the help of the government on &s;hore, he had got the ab&s;olute a&s;cendancy over his men, and was as implicitly obeyed as if he had been Cap|tain of a king's &s;hip. When he was importuned to declare when he intended to &s;ail, he cho&s;e to be &s;ilent; and when the men wanted to know upon what enterprize they were next to be em|ployed, he reproached them with their eagerne&s;s for piracy. He had &s;old Raja Laut &s;ome tons of iron and lead, and was to have had in return rice and beef; as to the fir&s;t, the Raja had failed in furni&s;hing the &s;tipulated quantity, and the lat|ter he had hitherto in no &s;hape fulfilled. The Raja had be&s;ides borrowed of him 20 ounces of gold; and, when he required payment, the Raja demanded a much larger &s;um for his own board, and the board of his men. This treatment, and the&s;e di&s;appointments, &s;erved to di&s;compo&s;e a mind naturally &s;our, and to put him out of humour with every body about him.</P>
<P>All this while the we&s;terly mon&s;oon was wa&s;t|ing that was to carry them on to India. The men began again to murmur, and grow unruly: &s;ome, weary of rambling about, and who had formed connections with the natives, were for &s;taying at Mindanao: &s;ome, who had hu&s;banded their money, of whom indeed there were but few, were eager to get home; and others, who were poor (by far the majority), were for con|tinuing their ravages, and were impatient to be in action.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="461">While matters were in this &s;ituation, &s;trong repre&s;entations were made to the Captain to come on board, and to declare him&s;elf; and, after many delays, a day was at length fixed for a determination.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho&s;e who were bent on re|turning home, fore&s;eeing that continued extra|vagancies would nece&s;&s;arily create new wants, and that new wants would require new means of &s;upply, took occa&s;ion &s;ecretly to purcha&s;e a canoe, and formed a de&s;ign to depart in the night for Borneo, where, by a letter ju&s;t receiv|ed from thence by a Mindaneian ve&s;&s;el, they hoped to meet with an Engli&s;h factory, and from thence find a pa&s;&s;age home; but Captain Swan getting intelligence of their de&s;ign, &s;eized their canoe, and threatened to puni&s;h for de|&s;erters all tho&s;e concerned in the plot.</P>
<P>Another party about the &s;ame time, hearing that the &s;hip was about to &s;ail, retired into the coun|try, to conceal them&s;elves till after her departure.</P>
<P>The party on board, who had nothing but the &s;hip's allowance to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, became unruly, and &s;ent a&s;hore to the merchants iron to &s;ell for arrack and honey, with which they made them|&s;elves drunk, and grew quarrel&s;ome. All the&s;e di&s;orders, Dampier &s;ays, might ea&s;ily have been redre&s;&s;ed, had Captain Swan exerted his autho|rity in time, and e&s;tabli&s;hed proper di&s;cipline on board the &s;hip; but he living with his mer|chants con&s;tantly on &s;hore, and leaving every
<PB N="384" REF="462" MS="y">
one to do as he plea&s;ed on board, they encou|raged one another in their villainies, and at length grew mutinous.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things were come to extremity, he gave orders that the whole crew &s;hould attend him on board the &s;hip, on the 13th of January [1687]; but, unluckily for him, two days before this meeting was to take place, Captain Swan &s;ent his gunner to fetch &s;omething he had occa|&s;ion for out of the locker of his cabin. This man, in rummaging for what he wanted, among other things happened to take out the Captain's journal, which, being laid carele&s;ly by, was taken up by one John Read, (an ingenious young man, who likewi&s;e kept a journal) out of mere curio&s;ity to peep in it, to &s;ee how nearly his and the other agreed.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t opening of the book he ca&s;t his eye on a part, in which the Captain had made a memorandum of the mutinous behaviour of his men in their pa&s;&s;age from Cape Corientes to Guam, and had particularly noted that of one John Read, a Jamaica-man, a name&s;ake of the Read who took the journal, but no relation. This naturally excited his curio&s;ity to look far|ther, and he found means, while the gunner was bu&s;y, to convey the journal away to exa|mine it at his lei&s;ure. As &s;oon as the gunner was gone a&s;hore, John Read, the arti&s;t, &s;hewed the book to John Read, the Jamaica-man, and both of them held a con&s;ultation with their comrages on the contents. The&s;e men, who
<PB N="385" REF="463">
were before ripe for mi&s;chief, now grew out|rageous, and it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to con|&s;ult Captain Teat, who, as has been before noted, had received unworthy treatment from Captain Swan on &s;hore, which, they knew, he only wanted an opportunity to re&s;ent. Teat left nothing un&s;aid to aggravate the failings of his &s;uperior, and to incen&s;e the company again&s;t him. He repre&s;ented him as proud, ignorant, avaricious, cruel, and vindictive, and withal cowardly, and unfit to command upon any bold and manly enterprize; called to their minds the oppo&s;ition he made to the attacking the Manilla &s;hip off Guam, by the conque&s;t of which they would all have been enriched; and which, he &s;aid, Swan did not oppo&s;e out of a principle of hone&s;ty or gratitude, but from the fear of en|gaging a &s;hip &s;o much &s;uperior to his own in weight of metal and in numbers, though he, Teat, would have pawned his head to have been ma&s;ter of her in a few hours clo&s;e attack. Men who&s;e expectations have been rai&s;ed to an un|rea&s;onable pitch, give ea&s;y credit to unfavour|able &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t the authors of their di&s;|appointment. The crew took lire, and in&s;tantly bound them&s;elves by an oath to deprive Captain Swan of the command, without naming any offi|cer to &s;ub&s;titute in his room; nay, &s;o precipitate was their re&s;olution, that the majority were for &s;et|ting &s;ail immediately, and leaving all that were on &s;hore behind: and this ha&s;ty re&s;olve would certainly have taken place, had either of the
<PB N="386" REF="464">
&s;urgeons been on board; but, as their cry was for war, it was judged too de&s;perate to go to &s;ea without one &s;kilful per&s;on on board to a&s;&s;i&s;t the wounded.</P>
<P>As all this pa&s;&s;ed in the night, it was agreed to &s;tay till morning, and then to &s;end a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger on &s;hore, &s;peedily to reque&s;t the &s;ur|geons to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a man who had broken his leg. The chief &s;urgeon &s;aid he &s;hould &s;ee the man the next day, and in the mean time &s;ent his mate, Mr. Herman Coppinger, to his immediate relief. This man, a few days be|fore, was &s;leeping at his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, when a &s;nake twi&s;ted it&s;elf round his neck, but quietly went away upon his waking without hurting him. Coppinger, &s;uppo&s;ing the accident real, made ha&s;te to pack up his moveables to go on board; and, as the Captain was to have his ge|neral rendezvous the next day, Dampier took the opportunity of going with him. They &s;carce had mounted the &s;hip's &s;ide before they di&s;covered the trick. But when the mutineers were thus in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;urgeon, they pre&s;ently di&s;patched the canoe to &s;hore again to invite all the men who cho&s;e it to come on board, but with a &s;trict caution not to tell the rea&s;on, le&s;t their de&s;ign &s;hould reach the ears of their Cap|tain.</P>
<P>The 13th in the morning they weighed, and fired a gun. The Captain, much alarmed, im|mediately di&s;patched Mr. Nelly, his mate, to know the cau&s;e. To him they told their griev|ances,
<PB N="387" REF="465">
and &s;hewed the journal; he per&s;uaded them to &s;tay till next day to hear what the Cap|tain and merchants had to &s;ay. They did &s;o, and Mr. Harthop came on board in the morn|ing. He advi&s;ed them to a reconciliation, and to take more rice on board. They were deaf to his per&s;ua&s;ion; yet at his entreaty they &s;taid till two in the afternoon to wait for the Captain, and &s;uch gentlemen or &s;eamen as cho&s;e to ac|company them, but &s;uffered none to go a&s;hore, except Mr. Harthop and a man with a wooden leg. Dampier remarks, that, if Captain Swan had then come on board, as a man of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit ought to have done, he might at the very la&s;t have cru&s;ht their de&s;igns, and reduced the mutineers to order and di&s;cipline; but being of a &s;ullen, &s;u&s;picious, vindictive temper him&s;elf, he dreaded the re&s;entment of tho&s;e he had marked for vengeance; and therefore &s;uffered the time to elap&s;e, and was with 36 others left behind in the town. Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ix or eight had de|&s;erted, and were up the country; and &s;ixteen had died of poi&s;on, given them, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the hu&s;bands of tho&s;e women whom they had &s;educed; and there were others on board, who had received the poi&s;on, and died of it &s;ome months after. In this manner their numbers were con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, and of 150 who &s;ailed from Cape Corientes, not above 80 were now on board.</P>
<P>It has been more than once hinted, that Cap|tain Swan &s;ailed from London with no de&s;ign of
<PB N="388" REF="466">
privateering, but of carrying on trade with the Spaniards on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of America. He had therefore a great quantity of heavy goods, &s;uch as iron and lead, not yet di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;ome of which he had &s;old to Raja Laut, and no doubt was willing to have received the payment before he departed. This may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ac|count for his delay. His crew was compo&s;ed of men, who, mo&s;t of them, had forced them&s;elves upon him for purpo&s;es which he abhorred; and perhaps, he wanted to have rid him&s;elf of the greate&s;t part of them, if he could have found a proper opportunity. Tho&s;e marked in his jour|nal were, no doubt, the men mo&s;t obnoxious to him, and the mo&s;t aver&s;e to trade, which he was determined to follow in his way home, having already 5000 l. of his owners money, which he had received for the goods put up by auction at his fir&s;t commencing buccaneer; with this he purpo&s;ed to have purcha&s;ed a cargo to take with him from the Ea&s;t Indies. Hence aro&s;e his my&s;|terious conduct, and his want of re&s;olution. The lo&s;s of his bark was his embarra&s;&s;ment. Could that have been rendered &s;erviceable, his de&s;ign could more ea&s;ily have been carried into execu|tion. The &s;u&s;picious part of the crew might have been &s;hipped on board the bark; and by giving them a wrong track, they might have been de&s;erted in the night, and left to their own cour&s;e. But a di&s;covery being made before the Captain's de&s;igns were ripe for execution, he was entangled in his own net.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="467">But to return: On the 14th of January, 1687, at three o'clock in the afternoon, they &s;et &s;ail from the river Mindanao, and next day came a-brea&s;t of Chambango, where formerly the Spa|niards had a &s;ettlement, and where, it is &s;aid, there were plenty of Swine and buffaloes. On the 17th, they anchored in a good bay on the we&s;t &s;ide of a &s;mall i&s;land, where they cho&s;e their officers, con&s;tituting John Read the Jamaica-man Captain, Thomas Teat Ma&s;ter, and Henry More Quarter-ma&s;ter; and, having cut &s;ome curious &s;hort-jointed canes, and plentifully &s;up|plied the &s;hip with water from a clear&s;pring, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e; but on their pa&s;&s;age they &s;truck on a rock, where after lying two hours, they were heaved off by the ri&s;ing of the tide, and e&s;caped with the lo&s;s only of a large piece of their rudder, though in more danger than ever they had experienced in the whole voyage.</P>
<P>On the 18th, they anchored at the north-we&s;t end of the i&s;land of Mindera, in 10 fathom wa|ter. While they lay there a canoe with four In|dians from Manilla came along &s;ide, who in|formed them, that at Manilla there was &s;eldom le&s;s than 20 or 30 &s;ail of &s;hips of different nations, who came to traffic with the Spani&s;h merchants; and that, if they meant to trade, they might for a trifle have a letter of recommendation from a friar to whom they were carrying di&s;patches, and would in a few days return with his an&s;wer. Trade, however, was no part of their employ|ment; and the Indians were &s;uffered to pa&s;s without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="468">On the 23d, they reached Luconia, the i&s;land &s;o ardently wi&s;hed for by this piratical crew, and pre&s;ently de&s;cried a &s;ail, which they in&s;tantly pur|&s;ued and took. She proved a Spani&s;h bark from Panga&s;&s;anam, laden with rice and cotton-cloth, and bound for Manilla. The ma&s;ter of this prize was boat&s;wain to the Acapulco &s;hip that pa&s;&s;ed by Guam; this man gave Dampier an account of all that happened on that occa&s;ion. The time of the year being too far &s;pent to effect any thing of con&s;equence on this coa&s;t, they concluded to &s;ail for Pulo Condore, and there wait till the lat|ter end of May, about which time the Acapulco &s;hip generally arrives at Manilla. With this re|&s;olution they quitted Luconia on the 26th of February; and, on the 14th of March, ca&s;t an|chor at the i&s;land of Condore, on the coa&s;t of Cambodia. Among the productions of the&s;e i&s;lands (for there is a clu&s;ter of them), there is a lofty tree, the body of which is in diameter three or four feet, from which the inhabitants extract a clammy juice, which being boiled becomes a perfect tar, and an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of that bal&s;am. On the 16th, they entered a conveni|ent harbour, and employed them&s;elves in careen|ing their &s;hips, in which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the natives of the i&s;land, who brought them hogs and turtle in exchange for rice, of which they had now great plenty.</P>
<P>While they lay in this harbour, two of the men died who had been poi&s;oned in Mindanao; they were opened by the &s;urgeon, and their livers
<PB N="391" REF="469">
were found black, light, and dry, like pieces of cork.</P>
<P>Before they departed, they engaged an old native who could &s;peak the Malayan language, to pilot them to Siam, where they expected to purcha&s;e dried fi&s;h, having nothing now but rice to eat at &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of April they &s;ailed from Condore, and, on the 24th, anchored in the bay of Siam, where, however, they could get no fi&s;h. On the 21&s;t of May they left Siam; and, in their return to Pulo Condore, overtook a Chine&s;e junk, laden with pepper, who told them that the Engli&s;h were &s;ettled on the i&s;land of Sumatra, at a place called Silleber, which was the fir&s;t intelligence they received of that factory. This junk ac|companied them to Pulo Condore, where Cap|tain Read, ob&s;erving a Malayan ve&s;&s;el at anchor within &s;hore, &s;ent a canoe to learn from whence they came; but, knowing the Malayans to be de&s;perate fellows, cautioned his men not to tru&s;t them&s;elves on board, but to hail them from the boat: but the men, not regarding the Captain's in&s;tructions, went on board armed; which the Malayans ob&s;erving, fell upon them unawares with their &s;hort daggers, and &s;tabbed five or &s;ix of them dead upon the &s;pot; the re&s;t jumped into the &s;ea, and &s;aved them&s;elves by &s;wimming, among whom was one Daniel Wallis, who never could &s;wim before or &s;ince, but in his fright made &s;hift to reach the boat, and made his e&s;cape with the re&s;t. Here Herman Coppin|ger,
<PB N="392" REF="470">
the &s;urgeon, went on &s;hore, on purpo&s;e to leave this diabolical company; but Read &s;ent an armed force, and pre&s;&s;ed him on board again. Dampier intended following his example, but waited a more convenient place.</P>
<P>They were now confined at this i&s;land by &s;tormy weather till the 4th of June; and in the mean time a Malayan Portugue&s;e from the junk entered on board, whom they entertained as an interpreter, to facilitate an intercour&s;e with the na|tives. When they weighed anchor, the wind was contrary; yet they kept plying to the we&s;tward in hopes of its &s;hifting to carry them to Manilla, before their much longed-for prize &s;hould arrive. In this hope they continued labouring ince&s;&s;antly for 10 days; when, being almo&s;t worn out with fatigue, and finding no probability of accom|pli&s;hing their de&s;ires, they relinqui&s;hed that pro|ject in de&s;pair, and, in&s;tead of it, &s;tood away for Prata, in lat. 20 deg. 40 min. N. where they flat|tered them&s;elves with fi&s;hing up much trea&s;ure from the China &s;hips that had been ca&s;t away on that i&s;land, &s;ome of which were &s;aid to contain immen&s;e riches. But in this too they were di&s;|appointed by adver&s;e winds; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the utmo&s;t exertion of their &s;kill in &s;eaman|&s;hip, they were driven by the violence of the gale to the i&s;land of St. John, on the coa&s;t of China. While they lay at this i&s;land they vi&s;it|ed the &s;hore every day, and purcha&s;ed hogs, fowls, and buffaloes. Some of the men vi&s;ited the continent, but found nothing there that an|&s;wered their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="471">On the 3d of July they weighed anchor with a gentle breeze, but on the 4th there came on a violent gale from the north-ea&s;t, which increa&s;ed till the dead of the night, when the rain began to pour down in &s;uch torrents that the fountains of heaven &s;eemed to be opened, and a &s;econd de|luge threatened; at the &s;ame time the thunder began to crack, and the fla&s;hes of lightning that pierced through the torrents of rain, appeared upon the face of the deep as if the &s;ea was over|&s;pread with a blue flame. The darkne&s;s that &s;ucceeded between the fla&s;hes pre&s;ented the mo&s;t horrid gloom that ever covered the deep. The &s;ea was rai&s;ed to an a&s;toni&s;hing height, and the waves broke &s;hort upon the &s;hip with &s;uch vio|lence, that it was thought every &s;ucceeding bil|low mu&s;t have da&s;hed her to the bottom. One &s;ea &s;truck away the rails of the head, and at the &s;ame time di&s;lodged the &s;heet-anchor that was la&s;hed with its fluke over the bend of the &s;hip in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, and it was every mo|ment expected to beat a hole through the &s;hip, by &s;triking again&s;t her bows. It then became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;teer right before the wind, to en|deavour to &s;ecure the anchor; and it was im|po&s;&s;ible afterwards to change the cour&s;e till the &s;torm abated. The fury of the &s;torm abated about four in the morning, about which time they ob&s;erved what the &s;ailors call a <HI>Corpus Sant</HI> at the ma&s;t-head. This meteor is &s;een at &s;ea, &s;ometimes at the ma&s;t-head, &s;ometimes at the yard-arm, and &s;ometimes upon the deck. When
<PB N="394" REF="472">
it appears aloft it is like a &s;tar, and is taken for a good omen; but when below, it re&s;embles a glow worm, and always dreaded as a bad &s;ign. The crew was overjoyed on &s;eeing it at the very pinnacle of the &s;hip's fane.</P>
<P>From two in the morning till &s;even they kept &s;cudding before the wind; but the wind gradu|ally dying away, and the &s;ea &s;ub&s;iding, they &s;et their mizzen, brought the &s;hip up upon a wind, and lay to under their mizzen till eleven, when for two hours there en&s;ued a perfect calm, yet the &s;ky looked black and lowring. About one the wind &s;hifted to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and began again to blow hard, with violent rain. They furled up their mizzen, wore &s;hip, and &s;uffered her to &s;cud before the wind, as before, till ten at night, when the wind cea&s;ed, and before morn|ing the &s;ea was calm, and the &s;ky perfectly &s;e|rene. This &s;torm, however, di&s;pirited the crew, who were now driven out of their knowledge, and were anxious for nothing but a place of &s;hel|ter to pre&s;erve them from the fury of a &s;econd hurricane, which they had rea&s;on to expect to|wards the full of the moon.</P>
<P>They con&s;ulted their &s;ea-charts, and conclud|ed to &s;teer for the Pi&s;cadores, i&s;lands &s;ituated in lat. 23 deg. N. of which, however, they knew nothing but the name. On the 20th of July they came in &s;ight of them; and when they ar|rived were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;o many junks pa&s;|&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing as were continually in &s;ight. They followed &s;ome of the large&s;t into a &s;pacious
<PB N="395" REF="473">
harbour, which brought them to a con&s;iderable town, &s;uch as they did not expect to have found among i&s;lands &s;o little known. On their at|tempting to land, they were met by a Tartarian officer, who demanded, whence they came, of what nation they were, and whither they were bound? And being told they were Engli&s;h, and driven there in di&s;tre&s;s, they were kindly enter|tained; but were told, they mu&s;t not come on &s;hore; but whatever nece&s;&s;aries they wanted, &s;hould be &s;ent them on board without delay. Mutual civilities were exchanged. The &s;hip was &s;upplied with the be&s;t provi&s;ions they had ever ta&s;ted; and the Captain in return &s;ent a curious Spani&s;h &s;ilver-hilted rapier, an Engli&s;h carbine, and a gold chain, as a pre&s;ent to the Governor. They &s;taid till the 29th, and then directed their cour&s;e to a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands that lie between Formo&s;a and Luconia, the place they &s;till &s;et their hearts upon. On the 6th of Au|gu&s;t they came in &s;ight of the i&s;lands they were in pur&s;uit of, and, contrary to expectation, found them well inhabited.</P>
<P>On the&s;e i&s;lands were plenty of goats and &s;wine, but very few birds or poultry. It is an ob&s;ervation of Dampier, founded on rea&s;on and confirmed by experience, that, in countries a|bounding in corn and maize, birds and all man|ner of fowls are bred in abundance; but in tho&s;e i&s;lands where the inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on fruits, roots, and fi&s;h, birds wild and tame are more rare.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="474">As the&s;e i&s;lands were without names in the &s;ea charts, Captain Read called them all by one general name of Ba&s;hee I&s;lands. The &s;ituation of their towns was remarkable. They were built on precipices inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide, except by ladders placed at the ends of the &s;treets, which all ran in lines parallel to each other, and on which the hou&s;es ri&s;e in ranges one above ano|ther, till they terminate in a &s;ingle row. The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands were acquainted with the u&s;e of iron, and they had among&s;t them a yellow metal that very much re&s;embled gold, for &s;ome of which Captain Read exchanged iron; and Dampier laments that he could purcha&s;e none of it, becau&s;e he had nothing to be&s;tow in return. They were very ingenious, had large fi&s;hing-boats, and lived in a peculiar manner different from any people they had yet vi&s;ited. They were not very delicate in their food; for they would gather up the goats-&s;kins and goats-paunches which the men threw away; and would &s;inge, broil, and eat the former; the latter they would &s;tew (not over nicely clean&s;ed), and, mincing raw fi&s;h very &s;mall, would mix the me&s;s together, and with a little &s;alt over it, make a very &s;avoury meal. The paunches of the &s;wine they never touched. They appeared to be very cleanly in their per&s;ons, and withal &s;o hone&s;t and good natured, that they would take nothing but what was given them; nor were they ever out of humour with the &s;trangers, though they had often cau&s;e enough, nor with one another.
<PB N="397" REF="475">
No provocation could incen&s;e them to anger; nor any opportunity induce them to theft. They brought con&s;tantly every morning goats, hogs, potatoes, and fruits, to the &s;hip, which they ex|changed for iron, nails, old hoops, or bullets. Thus the crew of the &s;hip fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, and &s;alted 70 or 80 hogs for future u&s;e. The&s;e i&s;lands lie in lat. 20 deg. 21 min. N.</P>
<P>Being now &s;ufficiently &s;tored with provi&s;ions, and having filled their ca&s;ks with water, after &s;taying from the 13th of Augu&s;t till the 24th of September, and after having mended their &s;ails, and &s;crubbed the &s;hips bottom, they were pre|paring to &s;ail, when a violent &s;torm came on, which forced them to cut their cables and put to &s;ea, leaving &s;ix of their be&s;t men on &s;hore.</P>
<P>They put before the wind with their bare poles; but it was the fir&s;t of October before they could recover to their former &s;tation. On the following day their &s;ix men were brought on board by the natives, whom they rewarded with three bars of iron, a pre&s;ent to them more valua|able than &s;o many bars of &s;olid gold. The men reported, that, as &s;oon as the &s;hip was out of &s;ight, the natives were more kind to them than ever; that they endeavoured to prevail upon them to cut their hair &s;hort, like theirs; and that they offered to each the choice of a wife, with a &s;mall hatchet, a &s;et of planter's tools, and a portion of land for each of them to cultivate by way of dowry; and, when the &s;hip came in &s;ight again, they then importuned them for iron, which was the only recompence they required.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="476">This &s;econd &s;torm quite di&s;concerted all their mea&s;ures. They began to think that the winds and the waves were employed again&s;t them, and were terrified with the thoughts of their un|happy &s;ituation. Mo&s;t of them were heartily weary of being to&s;t to and fro to no manner of purpo&s;e, and were very de&s;irous of getting home: only Read and Teat were determined to make their fortunes at whatever ri&s;que; they therefore, finding the crew re&s;olute to leave this dangerous coa&s;t, per&s;uaded them to accompany them to Cape Comorin, where, if they di&s;ap|proved of their proceedings, every one &s;hould be at liberty to follow his own cour&s;e. To this they all agreed; but the&s;e freebooters, fearing to meet Engli&s;h or Dutch &s;hips in the direct road, propo&s;ed to coa&s;t along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Philippines, and &s;o, keeping &s;outh towards the &s;pice i&s;lands, to pa&s;s into the Indian ocean near the i&s;land of Timor. With this view they &s;et &s;ail on the 3d of October, 1687; and leaving the i&s;land of Luconia on the we&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with all our golden projects," &s;ays Dampier, "along with it, we &s;tood to the &s;outhward till we came in &s;ight of the i&s;land St. John on the coa&s;t of Mindanao, and on the 16th came to an anchor on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of that i&s;land."</Q> While they lay in this bay, the young prince of Meangis, formerly mentioned, came on board, and importuned Captain Read to tran&s;port him and his men back to his own i&s;land, promi&s;ing to reward him hand&s;omely for his trouble. He
<PB N="399" REF="477">
&s;aid, that a few days before he had &s;een Captain Swan and &s;ome of his people all well at the city of Mindanao; that they had accompanied Raja Laut in a military expedition again&s;t his ene|mies, and had acquired great honour and were in high favour with the Sultan; that Captain Swan was preparing to leave the i&s;land; and that he had offered 40 ounces of gold for a &s;hip to carry him off, but did not think the Raja would &s;uffer him to depart. Captain Read promi&s;ed to &s;tay for the prince three days, and in that time he engaged to return with his men. In the mean time Dampier took occa&s;ion to &s;ound how the crew &s;tood affected towards their old Captain, and found one party, who happen|ed to be filling water a&s;hore, very well inclined; and he de&s;ired them to be &s;ilent till he had con|&s;ulted the other party who&s;e turn it was next day to fill water at the &s;ame place; but one of the company, who appeared to be the mo&s;t zealous in Swan's favour, as &s;oon as he got aboard di&s;|covered the &s;ecret; on which Read and Teat ordered all hands on board and weighed di|rectly.</P>
<P>Dampier &s;ays he was afterwards informed, that Captain Swan and his men continued long at Mindanao; that Me&s;&s;ieurs Harthop and Smith, merchants, both died there; that Rofy and Nelly, his mates, got pa&s;&s;age in a Dutch &s;hip to Batavia, and from thence, after va|rious adventures, to Europe; and that Swan him&s;elf, with his &s;urgeon, endeavouring to get
<PB N="400" REF="478">
on board another Dutch &s;hip, were run down and drowned by the natives by order of Raja Laut, who &s;eized their gold. Among other rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this treachery, Dampier mentions Swan's threatening, on &s;ome provocation, to rai&s;e a band of men to de&s;troy the town, and &s;eize upon the country. Be this as it may, the poor Captain lo&s;t his life, and the Raja kept his money. Part of his journal, as far as Cape Corientes, was recovered and pre&s;erved by a Mr. Moody, of whom mention will be made here|after.</P>
<P>On November the 2d, the day the prince was to have come on board, Captain Read &s;et &s;ail, and &s;tood to the we&s;t, till on the 9th, the wind changing, they came up with the north ea&s;t end of the i&s;land of Celebes, in lat. 3 deg. N. 30 leagues to the &s;outhward of Gilolo, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of which lie the clove i&s;lands of Tidore and Ternate, the fine&s;t in the world. At the &s;outhermo&s;t end of Celebes the town of Maca&s;&s;er is &s;eated, the chief place of trade in tho&s;e parts belonging to the Dutch.</P>
<P>They anchored in a &s;andy bay on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of Celebes, where they found a creeping kind of vine, the leaves of which pounded and boiled with hog's-lard is an infallible cure for old ulcers. The men, knowing its virtues, crammed their che&s;ts with it; and one man, who&s;e legs were ulcerated, was perfectly cured by the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Here they cut down a tree 18 feet in circum|ference,
<PB N="401" REF="479">
and 44 feet in clean body. It proved un&s;ound, and therefore unfit for the purpo&s;e they intended it, which was that of a canoe; they therefore left it, and &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 30th, they &s;ailed &s;outh; and in the afternoon they had a violent tornado, and &s;aw a &s;pout. This phenomenon appears at fir&s;t like a &s;mall ragged cloud, hanging &s;loping from a black heavy cloud above, &s;mall at the bottom, &s;eemingly no bigger than a man's arm. Un|derneath this the &s;ea begins to be in gentle agi|tation, and gradually proceeds to foam and froth till a violent whirling en&s;ues, and then it flies upwards in a pillar, the ba&s;e of which may be about one hundred paces in com|pa&s;s, but le&s;&s;ening gradually till it decrea&s;es to the &s;ize of the &s;pout, with which it meets, and through which the ri&s;ing &s;ea-water &s;eems to be conveyed to increa&s;e the cloud. As &s;oon as the water reaches the &s;pout, you then &s;ee the cloud, that was at re&s;t before, drive along with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;ucking up the water in its cour&s;e, and cau&s;ing a furious wind to fly before it. Thus it will continue &s;ometimes half an hour, &s;ometimes longer, till breaking off, all the water that remains below the &s;pout falls down again into the &s;ea, with a dreadful noi&s;e and violent agitation of the waves. Dampier relates, that one Captain Records, of London, being on the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the year 1674, in a &s;hip of 300 tons, was overtaken by one of the&s;e &s;pouts, which broke before he could well furl his fails to receive it. On its breaking, it made
<PB N="402" REF="480">
the &s;ame kind of noi&s;e as if a ca&s;tle or &s;ome im|men&s;e building had been plunged from a great height into the &s;ea, and rai&s;ed the billows in proportion to its height. The fury of the wind, at the &s;ame time, took the &s;hip on the &s;tarboard bow, and &s;napt off the bolt&s;prit and forema&s;t both at once like rotten &s;ticks, and drove the &s;hip along ready to over&s;et her; but the &s;hip pre&s;ently righting, and the wind whirling round, took her again on the oppo&s;ite quarter, and &s;napt the mizzen-ma&s;t as the fore-ma&s;t and bolt&s;prit had been &s;napt before. Three men were in the fore top when the fore-ma&s;t broke, and one on the bolt&s;prit, when they fell into the &s;ea; but all were &s;aved, and the &s;hip with dif|ficulty carried into port.</P>
<P>December 1&s;t, they continued to move &s;low|ly along, and on the 4th they came up with the north-we&s;t end of the i&s;land of Bouton, where their &s;trikers killed &s;ome turtle, and brought with them an Indian who conducted them to a harbour, where they had an interview with the Sultan, and where they were permitted to purcha&s;e whatever they wanted, and where Captain Read was pre&s;ented by the Sovereign with a little boy who had a double &s;et of teeth, one &s;et within another, on each jaw.</P>
<P>On the 12th, they took leave of the Sultan, and were about weighing anchor; but when they expected it to ri&s;e, being hooked to a rock, the cable came home without it. As &s;oon as they were loo&s;e, finding the anchor irrecoverable, they &s;teered to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and fell in with
<PB N="403" REF="481">
&s;ome i&s;lands five or &s;ix leagues from Calla&s;u&s;ung harbour. They appeared very green; and as they pa&s;&s;ed them in the night they heard drums beating, but whether for mirth, or &s;preading an alarm, they knew not.</P>
<P>On the 20th, they pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land of Omba, and &s;aw in it many &s;moaks by day, and fires by night, but ob&s;erved no inhabitants. From Omba they pa&s;&s;ed by Timor, where, meeting with tornados and &s;trong gales of wind, they endea|voured to get clear of the &s;hoals, and &s;tood off &s;outh, intending to touch at New Holland to try what that country would afford.</P>
<P>On the 4th of January, 1688, they fell in with the coa&s;t of New Holland in lat. 16 deg. 50 min. S. and, &s;teering clo&s;e in, came to a point from whence the land trends ea&s;t and &s;outherly for 10 or 12 leagues, but how far &s;outherly Dampier &s;ays he does not know. That able navigator, however, pronounced, that, if it was not a continent, it neither joined to A&s;ia, Africa, nor America. They fell in upon the we&s;t &s;ide, and examined but a &s;mall part of this va&s;t tract of land, of which Captain Cook, in his late voyage round the world in the Endea|vour, traver&s;ed the ea&s;tern coa&s;t for near 2000 miles, and has left it &s;till doubtful whether it is i&s;land or continent. There is a remarkable dif|ference between Dampier's de&s;cription of the part he vi&s;ited on the we&s;t, and that de&s;cribed by Captain Cook in the &s;ame latitude on the ea&s;t &s;ide. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The land," &s;ays Dampier, "is of a dry &s;andy &s;oil, de&s;titute of water, except
<PB N="404" REF="482">
you make wells. There are divers &s;orts of trees; but the woods are not thick, nor the trees large. Mo&s;t of them were dragon-trees, of the &s;ize of apple-trees&mdash;we compared the gum with the gum dragon we had aboard, and found it the &s;ame&mdash;we &s;aw no trees that bore fruit. We &s;aw no animal, nor any track of animal but one, and that was of a bea&s;t of the &s;ize of a ma&s;tiff-dog&mdash;few land-birds, and none bigger than a black-bird&mdash;few &s;ea-fowls&mdash;few fi&s;h, turtle and manatee excepted. The in|habitants are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable people in the world&mdash;without hou&s;es&mdash;without cloathing&mdash;without conveniences of any kind&mdash;and, &s;et|ting a&s;ide their human &s;hape, very little diffe|rent from brutes. They are tall, &s;trait bodied, thin, and &s;mall limbs; they have great heads, round fore-heads, and large brows. Their eye|lids are always half-clo&s;ed; they have great bottle-no&s;es, full lips, wide mouths, and the two fore-teeth in the upper jaw wanting in all of them; but whether they draw them out or not, I know not. [Captain Cook &s;ays, tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide have their teeth entire.] They are long-vi&s;aged&mdash;without beards&mdash;of an un|plea&s;ing a&s;pect, with no one graceful feature in their faces&mdash;their hair black, &s;hort, and curled like negroes&mdash;and their colour coal-black. They live in companies, 20 or 30 men, women, and children, together&mdash;their food is fi&s;h, and their manner of catching them is in weirs acro&s;s little inlets of the &s;ea, in which every tide leaves &s;ome&mdash;they have no in&s;tru|ments
<PB N="405" REF="483">
to take great fi&s;h&mdash;in other places they fi&s;h for cockles, mu&s;cles, periwinkles, but of the&s;e there are but few&mdash;of what they catch all partake alike&mdash;all watch the tides&mdash;for all depend upon the &s;ea for their &s;upport; the earth producing neither herb, root, pul&s;e, or any &s;ort of grain. The&s;e poor creatures, adds Dampier, have a &s;ort of weapons, con&s;i&s;ting of a piece of wood &s;haped &s;omewhat like a cutla&s;s, and a long &s;traight pole with a &s;harp end hardened in the fire: with the&s;e they made a &s;hew of frightening us; but on firing one gun, they all ran away frighted."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the de&s;cription given by Dampier of the people of the north part of New Holland; and it is not a little a&s;toni&s;hing, that a man, by once touching upon their coa&s;t, could &s;o mi|nutely de&s;cribe a people with whom he could no otherwi&s;e conver&s;e but by &s;igns and ge&s;tures. The crew made an acquaintance with &s;ome of them, and gave them meat, which they readily devoured, but paid no regard to the &s;hip, nor did they &s;eem to admire any thing that was &s;hewn or offered to them. While the &s;hip re|mained here, where nothing was to be gotten, Dampier endeavoured to per&s;uade the men to carry her to &s;ome Engli&s;h factory; but that too being told the Commanders, he was threat|ened to be &s;et a&s;hore,, and left among the&s;e mi|&s;erable beings.</P>
<P>On the 12th of March they quitted New Hol|land, with a view to &s;ail to the i&s;le of Cocos, in
<PB N="406" REF="484">
lat. 12 deg. 12 min. S. but the wind being con|trary, they cho&s;e to bear away to the i&s;lands on the we&s;t of Sumatra, with which Dampier &s;ays he was well plea&s;ed, as he then might have an opportunity of making his e&s;cape from them. They met with nothing worth notice till the 28th, when they fell in with a woody i&s;land, where they killed boobies and men-of-war birds as many as the &s;hip's company could eat, and where they found a land animal re&s;embling a large crab without its great claws, &s;uch as Sir Francis Drake met with in the i&s;land of Ternate, and which being dre&s;&s;ed, was excellent meat. The&s;e creatures burrow in the ground like rabbits, and two of them were as much as a man could eat.</P>
<P>They made but a &s;hort &s;tay at this i&s;land; and, proceeding on their cour&s;e, on the 7th of April they came in &s;ight of the high land of Sumatra; and on the 13th they came to a &s;mall i&s;land called Tri&s;te, 14 or 15 leagues to the we&s;t of Sumatra, where they loaded their boats with cocoa-nuts, and &s;truck &s;ome turtle to &s;upply their table, having now nothing but rice to live upon.</P>
<P>They continued crui&s;ing among the i&s;lands to the we&s;t of Sumatra; and, on the 29th, they came in &s;ight of a &s;ail, to which they gave chace, and on the 30th they took her. She proved a proa, with four men belonging to Achin, laden with cocoa-nuts and cocoa-nut oil. They took out of her as much as they thought fit, bored a hole in her bottom, and &s;unk her, keeping the
<PB N="407" REF="485">
four men pri&s;oners. All this coa&s;t is known to the Engli&s;h by the name of the We&s;t-coa&s;t, with|out adding the name of Sumatra; and the pri&s;o|ners &s;hewed the channels and openings to the i&s;land of Achin, where the Engli&s;h had a factory, to which many on board wi&s;hed to find a pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The 4th of May they came in &s;ight of one of the Nicobar i&s;lands, the &s;outhernmo&s;t of which lies about 40 leagues to the N. N. W. of Sumatra. The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands are independent of every other people, and trade with the &s;hips of every nation indifferently that happen to touch upon their coa&s;t. Their chief commodi|ties are ambergrea&s;e and fruits, the former of which they adulterate abominably; and Cap|tain Welden, who touched at the&s;e i&s;lands a few weeks before their arrival, purcha&s;ed &s;ome at a low price that was worth nothing.</P>
<P>On the 5th of May they anchored at the N. W. end of the i&s;land of Nicobar, properly &s;o called, in lat. 7 deg. 30 min N. Here Dam|pier quitted the free-booters, but not without &s;ome difficulty. He knew it was impo&s;&s;ible to do it by &s;tealth; and therefore a&s;ked Captain Read, as &s;oon as he learned that the &s;hip was about to &s;ail, to &s;et him on &s;hore on this i&s;land. He &s;ays, he had another motive for &s;taying at this particular place, be&s;ides that of leaving Cap|tain Read, which he always intended, and that was, that he had here a pro&s;pect of commencing a profitable trade for ambergrea&s;e with the&s;e people,
<PB N="408" REF="486">
and of gaining a con&s;iderable fortune to him&s;elf; for, by rowing with the natives, and conforming to their cu&s;toms and manner of living, he ima|gined he &s;hould be able to learn how they got their ambergrea&s;e, and likewi&s;e the whole &s;ecret of preparing it. Captain Read, thinking this as ob&s;cure a place as any, and being willing, no doubt, to be rid of a man who was for ever ex|citing the company to oppo&s;e him, very readily con&s;ented; and Dampier as readily took him at his word. In an in&s;tant he got all his moveables together, and &s;towing them in the &s;hip's canoe, he prevailed upon &s;ome of the people to row him a&s;hore, and to land him on a &s;andy bay, near to which were two hou&s;es, but without inhabitants. He had not been landed an hour before Captain Teat and three or four armed men came to fetch him on board again. He tells us, that if a cabbin-boy had been &s;ent for him he &s;hould have return|ed; but he no &s;ooner entered the &s;hip than he found the whole crew in an uproar, &s;everal others, encouraged by his example, in&s;i&s;ting to be &s;et a&s;hore likewi&s;e, among whom was Herman Cop|pinger, the &s;urgeon, who having jumped into the boat with a gun in his hand, &s;wore he would &s;hoot dead the fir&s;t man that oppo&s;ed him; yet John Oliver, the quarter-ma&s;ter, leapt into the canoe to him, and wrenched the gun from him: he was pre&s;ently followed by others, who forced Coppinger again on board. When this tumult was appea&s;ed, and the &s;urgeon again in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, they &s;uffered Dampier, with two other
<PB N="409" REF="487">
malecontents (a Mr. Hall, and a &s;ailor named Ambro&s;e), to depart quietly; and the man who rowed them on &s;hore, having concealed an ax, gave it them at parting, well knowing what a valuable pre&s;ent it would be to conciliate them to the Indians. The&s;e three Engli&s;hmen were &s;oon joined by the four pri&s;oners taken from the Achine&s;e proa, and the mongrel Portugue&s;e, for|merly taken from the Chine&s;e junk, all of whom Captain Read &s;et on &s;hore before he departed. They were now eight in number; and, having concluded to leave the i&s;land, and row to Suma|tra, at 40 leagues di&s;tance, they purcha&s;ed a ca|noe of the natives for an ax; and, having pro|vided a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they all embarked on the 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h of May, in order to proceed; but they had no &s;ooner put to &s;ea than the canoe over&s;et, and turned bottom upwards. Being near the &s;hore they pre&s;erved their lives by &s;wimming; but though the Engli&s;h recovered their che&s;ts and fire-arms, yet their books and papers were mi|&s;erably defaced by the &s;ea-water; their powder e&s;caped without injury, being &s;ealed up. Though this accident &s;eemed an unfortunate out&s;et, yet it proved the means of their future &s;afety; for while the Engli&s;h were drying their books, and cleaning their arms, the Achine&s;e employed them&s;elves in &s;itting up their boat with out-leaguers, which are beams placed acro&s;s the body of the boat, projecting a yard or two over the &s;ides, and united at the extremities by tran&s;ver&s;e
<PB N="410" REF="488">
boards jointed to the ends; while the&s;e remain entire, the ve&s;&s;el can never over-&s;et. Be&s;ides the out-leaguers, the Achine&s;emen had provided a good &s;tout ma&s;t, and had contrived a &s;ail. And thus fitted out, on the 15th of May they again embarked; but their provi&s;ions being exhau&s;t|ed, it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to repair to a di&s;|tant part of the i&s;land, to procure a &s;upply. Here a mi&s;under&s;tanding aro&s;e between them and the natives, which by the prudent management of Dampier was &s;oon accommodated. He ob&s;erves, that there is not a people upon earth that he &s;hould be afraid to approach unarmed and alone, provided no previous injury had been done them by any of his company unprovoked. An Euro|pean has it always in his power to in&s;inuate him|&s;elf into the favour of the mo&s;t &s;avage people by &s;ome &s;light, by &s;hewing them &s;ome toy, by &s;miles and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and even by &s;hewing them the &s;imple knack of lighting a match with a flint and &s;teel. The only danger, he adds, is from their fir&s;t on&s;et, becau&s;e their way is to ab&s;cond, and kill by &s;urprize; if therefore their fir&s;t fury can be avoided, the fierce&s;t of them becomes gentle as a lamb.</P>
<P>The natives being again brought to good hu|mour, they were pre&s;ently furni&s;hed with &s;uch provi&s;ions as they wanted; and they again em|barked on their former project. At their fir&s;t &s;etting out, the wind was fair, and the weather hot; and they proceeded rowing and &s;ailing as occa&s;ion required, Mr. Hall and Dampier tak|ing
<PB N="411" REF="489">
it by turns to manage the helm. However, after two days labour, they found that they had &s;teered a wrong cour&s;e; and, in&s;tead of approach|ing Sumatra, they were but eight leagues from Nicobar. They then changed their cour&s;e, but were &s;till &s;o violently oppo&s;ed by a contrary cur|rent, that on the third day they had made but little way.</P>
<P>On the 18th the wind fre&s;hened, and the &s;ky began to be clouded. About nine in the morn|ing they had an alarming pre&s;age by a circle round the &s;un, which in that climate is an in|fallible &s;ign of an approaching &s;torm. They therefore, after &s;ome con&s;ultation, concluded to &s;tand before the wind to whatever land was right a-head; and for that purpo&s;e they furled their &s;ail, &s;ettled the yard about three feet above the boat's &s;ides, and in this manner prepared to re|ceive the &s;torm. About 12 at noon the gale came on, and the wind continued increa&s;ing all the afternoon. The &s;ea &s;welled to an incredible height, and often broke over the little &s;kiff (hardly &s;o big as a below-bridge wherry, only a &s;mall matter deeper, but not &s;o wide), which, had it not been for her out-leaguers, could not have &s;urvived a &s;ingle moment; but the thinne&s;s of her body, and the firmne&s;s of her out-leaguers, were her &s;ecurity; for the &s;tern being high and narrow, cut the rolling waves like the edge of a knife, and divided their force; &s;o that what fell in the &s;kiff came down like a &s;hower, and was ea&s;ily baled out by the Achine&s;e. The evening
<PB N="412" REF="490">
of this day &s;hewed very dreadful. Dampier's own words will be&s;t de&s;cribe his feelings: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;ky looked very black, &s;ays he, being covered with dark clouds, the wind blew hard, and the &s;ea was already roaring in a white foam about us; a dark night coming on, and no land in &s;ight to &s;helter us; and our little ark in danger to be &s;wallowed by every wave; and, what was wor&s;t of all, none of us thought our&s;elves prepared for another world. I had been in many imminent dan|gers before now, but the wor&s;t of them all was but a play-game in compari&s;on with this. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was in great conflicts of mind at this time. Other dangers came not upon me with &s;uch a lei&s;urely and dreadful &s;olemnity; a &s;udden &s;kirmi&s;h or engagement was nothing when the blood was warm, and pu&s;hed forwards with eager expectations; but here I had a lingering view of approaching death, and little or no hopes of e&s;caping it; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that my courage, that had hitherto kept up, failed me here; and I made very &s;ad reflections on my former life, and look|ed backward with horror and dete&s;tation upon actions which before I di&s;liked, but now I trembled at the remembrance of them. I had long before this repented me of that roving cour&s;e of life, but never with &s;uch concern as now. In this temper of mind, &s;ubmitting our&s;elves to God's good providence, and tak|ing all the care we could to pre&s;erve our lives,

Mr. Hall and I took turns to &s;teer, and the re&s;t took turns to heave out the water; and thus we provided to &s;pend the mo&s;t doleful night I ever was in. About 10 o'clock it began to thunder, lighten, and rain; but the rain was welcome to us, having drank up all the water we brought from the i&s;land. The wind at fir&s;t blew harder than before; but with|in half an hour it became more moderate, and the &s;ea a&s;&s;uaged of its fury. And then by a lighted match, of which we kept a piece burning on purpo&s;e, we looked on our com|pa&s;s, to &s;ee how we &s;teered, and found we varied but little from our intended cour&s;e: and, finding our ve&s;&s;el lively enough with that &s;mall &s;ail which was abroad, we began to bear up to the true point to which our views were directed. But about two in the morning we had another gu&s;t of wind, with thunder, lightning, and rain, which obliged us again to put before the wind. The hard rain &s;oaked us &s;o thoroughly, that we had not one dry thread about us, and the cold rain chilled us extremely; for any fre&s;h-water is much colder than the &s;ea-water, and much more unwhole|&s;ome for man's body. In this wet, &s;tarving condition, we &s;pent the tedious night. Never did poor mariners on a lee-&s;hore more ear|ne&s;tly long for the dawning light than we did. At length the day appeared; but with &s;uch dark black clouds near the horizon, that the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of the dawn appeared dreadful.
<PB N="414" REF="493">
We continued our cour&s;e before the wind till eight in the morning of the 19th, and then one of our Achine&s;ian friends cried out, <HI>Pulo Way.</HI> We, thinking the fellow had &s;aid <HI>Pull Away,</HI> were at a lo&s;s to conceive his rea&s;on; but pre&s;ently ob&s;erving his motions, we found he pointed to his companions to &s;hew them land. We, dropping with wet, cold, and hungry, were overjoyed at this &s;ight. It bore &s;outh, and the wind was &s;till at we&s;t, a &s;trong gale; yet with our &s;mall fail, no bigger than an apron, we changed our cour&s;e, and bore up to it. Here our out-leaguers did us great &s;ervice; and, though our boat's &s;ide was pre&s;&s;ed down very much, we could brook it well enough, and next day we ran to the mouth of a river in the i&s;land of Sumatra, called Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca, where all fell ill of fe|vers, of which &s;ome died; and I that &s;urvived was a whole year before I recover'd my &s;trength."</Q></P>
<P>Here they &s;taid ten or twelve days, and were kindly entertained, becau&s;e the Achine&s;e told the natives, that they were pri&s;oners on board the pirate as well as them&s;elves, and that they were all &s;et a&s;hore together. Hall and Dampier were &s;trongly importuned to &s;tay, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in improv|ing their navigation; but, longing to get home, they cho&s;e to be conveyed to the Engli&s;h fac|tory at Achin: a ve&s;&s;el was therefore provided for them, and in three days they arrived &s;afe. Three days after their arrival, the Portugue&s;e
<PB N="415" REF="494">
died, and Ambro&s;e lived but a &s;hort time after him. Dampier and Mr. Hall, after pa&s;&s;ing ex|amination, were kindly entertained by Mr. Dri&s;|cal, an Iri&s;h gentleman, interpreter to the fac|tory; and the four Achine&s;e were re&s;tored to their families and friends.</P>
<P>Dampier was &s;o drenched by a Malayan doc|tor, that he never expected to &s;urvive the effects of the potions he pre&s;cribed; yet after more than &s;ixty evacuations from one do&s;e, he gathered &s;trength daily; and, after his health was a little re&s;tored, both Hall and he undertook to &s;ail with Captain Bowry to Nicobar. This Capt. Bowry was the gentleman who &s;ent the letter from Su|matra to Mindanao, already &s;poken of, which involved a double mi&s;take. Bowry imagined an Engli&s;h factory to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at Mindanao, and the Engli&s;h at Mindanao, from Bowry's letter, ima|gined there had been an Engli&s;h factory at Su|matra. They &s;ailed from Achin-road the be|ginning of June; but, a &s;torm coming on, they pre&s;ently returned. About this time Captain Welden arrived from Fort St. George; and Dampier engaged to &s;ail with him to Tonqueen, in China, and afterwards made a voyage to Ma|lacca. His next ramble was to Fort. St. George, and, after his return from thence, he came to Bencouli, an Engli&s;h factory on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Sumatra; from whence, about the beginning of 1691, he &s;et out on his return to England.</P>
<P>After his return to Achin from his voyage to Malacca, he found there one Mr. Morgan, for|merly
<PB N="416" REF="495">
belonging to the Cygnet, who was then mate of a Dani&s;h &s;hip belonging to Tranquebar: and being curious to know the &s;equel of the ad|ventures of his old companions, was told by Morgan, that, when they left Nicobar, they di|rected their cour&s;e to Ceylon; but, not being able to weather that i&s;land, they were forced to &s;eek refre&s;hment on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, where they began to form new projects; but their &s;chemes not &s;ucceeding, about half their num|ber left them, among whom were Morgan and Coppinger, who both were entertained in the Dani&s;h &s;ervice, and two or three others repaired to Fort St. George; but the main body went up the country, and li&s;ted in the army of the Great Mogul, where a few of them continued orderly for &s;ome time; but Oliver, the quarter-ma&s;ter, and a party with him, &s;oon left the camp, and rambled about, plundering and robbing the vil|lages, and flying whenever they were pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Captain Read, having thus lo&s;t the better half of his men, after having filled his water and got rice, &s;ailed again, &s;till intending for the Red Sea. He had taken off Ceylon a rich Por|tugue&s;e &s;hip, and had plundered her of what he liked; but not being able to bear up again&s;t the we&s;terly winds, he &s;tood for the i&s;land of Ma|daga&s;car. There, after various adventures, Captain Read, with half a dozen of his fol|lowers, &s;lipt away from the re&s;t of the com|pany, and embarked in a &s;hip for New York.
<PB N="417" REF="496">
Captain Teat &s;ucceeded Captain Read in the command; and, having joined Captain Knight, of whom mention has been made before, they &s;ailed &s;ome time in company; but the Cygnet proving leaky, Knight gave her the &s;lip, on which &s;he returned again to Madaga&s;car, and finally &s;unk in St. Augu&s;tin bay.</P>
<P>While Dampier was at Fort St. George, there arrived a &s;hip from Mindanao, laden with clove-bark, on board of which came Mr. Moody, as &s;upercargo. This gentleman, while at Minda|nao, purcha&s;ed the Prince of Meangis, of who&s;e country mention has already been made in the former part of this relation. This unfortunate Prince, with his mother, and &s;ome attendants, had been driven off their own coa&s;t by a &s;torm, and had been &s;eized at &s;ea by &s;ome Mindaneian fi&s;hermen, who brought them to Mindanao, and &s;old them for &s;laves; a common practice among &s;avage i&s;landers. The Prince attracted the no|tice of Mr. Moody by the curious manner in which he was painted, and which, by Dampier's de&s;cription, exactly corre&s;ponds with that of ta|taowing among the New Zealanders. His de&s;ign was to have brought him over with him to Eng|land; but Mr. Moody &s;peaking the Malayan language, and being otherwi&s;e well qualified to manage the company's affairs at a new factory, he was per&s;uaded by the Governor of Fort St. George to accept of the Chief &s;hip of Indrapore, in the room of Mr. Gibbons, who had ju&s;t re|&s;igned in order to return home. Upon this un|expected
<PB N="418" REF="497">
promotion, Mr. Moody importuned Dampier to go with him to be his gunner, and, in order to encourage him thereto, promi&s;ed to purcha&s;e a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to carry the Prince and his mother to their own country, and to &s;end him as Commander, with full power to e&s;tabli&s;h a commerce with Meangis, which could not fail of turning greatly to the advantage of all con|cerned. This was a generous and friendly of|fer which Dampier could not refu&s;e; and ac|cordingly he embarked in a company's coa&s;ting &s;hip, in which there were &s;even or eight officers pa&s;&s;engers, and about 60 &s;oldiers for the new factories. They had a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age till they came upon the we&s;t coa&s;t of Sumatra, when a &s;torm aro&s;e, by which they were driven from their intended port, and forced to make the har|bour of Bencouli. At Bencouli they were all very kindly received, and the gunner of that fort being ju&s;t dead, Dampier was offered the po&s;t, with a more ample &s;alary than Mr. Moody, in a newly-e&s;tabli&s;hed factory, could venture to allow. Dampier con&s;ented to accept of this appointment, provided Mr. Moody approved of it; and Mr. Moody, not being certain of being able to fulfil his engagement, &s;o far as the &s;ame related to the Prince of Meangis, very readily gave Dampier leave to contract with the Governor of Bencouli; and, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;igned to him a half-&s;hare in the two &s;laves, the Prince and his mother, that he might not
<PB N="419" REF="498">
be a &s;ufferer by leaving Fort St. George to fol|low him.</P>
<P>Matters being thus accommodated, Mr. Moody repaired to his &s;tation at Indrapore, and Dampier with the two &s;laves continued at Bencouli. They lived at a hou&s;e in the town, and Dampier was accommodated in the fort. All this pa&s;&s;ed in 1690; but, before the year was expired, Dampier grew tired of his office, and, wanting to get home, applied to the Go|vernor and Council for his di&s;charge. The Coun|cil thought it highly rea&s;onable that his reque&s;t &s;hould be granted; and the Governor made no oppo&s;ition, there being at that time no &s;hip in readine&s;s to carry him off: but, as he had fore|&s;een, when the <HI>Defence,</HI> Captain Heath, bound for England, came into harbour, he then made many excu&s;es, and at length ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to permit him to go. In vain did Captain Heath remon&s;trate; and in vain al&s;o did Mr. Goddard, the chief mate, intere&s;t him&s;elf in Dampier's re|lea&s;e,&mdash;the Governor was inflexible. The <HI>Defence</HI> had touched at Indrapore before &s;he put into Bencouli; and Mr. Moody had con&s;igned the other half-&s;hare of the &s;laves to Mr. Goddard, on having been previou&s;ly acquainted by letter from Dampier of his intention to &s;ail for England. In con&s;equence of this a&s;&s;ignment, the Prince who &s;ome time before had been attacked with an in|fectious di&s;temper, of which his mother died, and of which he was but ju&s;t recovered, was put on board the <HI>Defence</HI>; and it was privately agreed
<PB N="420" REF="499">
between Captain Heath and Dampier, that, if the latter could make his e&s;cape, the former would undertake to carry him &s;afe off. Accord|ingly, when all the company's bu&s;ine&s;s was com|pleted, and the letters put on board, notice was given to Dampier of the preci&s;e time when the &s;hip was to &s;ail; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and, &s;ays he, after &s;everal a&s;&s;ays, I &s;lipt away at midnight; and, creep|ing through one of the port-holes of the fort, I got to the &s;hore, where the &s;hip's boat wait|ed for me, and carried me on board."</Q></P>
<P>On the 25th of January, 1691, they &s;et &s;ail for the Cape of Good Hope; and, the wind be|ing fair, they proceeded at fir&s;t very &s;ucce&s;sfully: but they had not been long at &s;ea before the men began to droop, being attacked with a di&s;temper that &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly upon them, and before they thought them&s;elves ill were ready to die. Dam|pier attributes this fatal di&s;order to the badne&s;s of their water, which was filled from a river fed by many noxious &s;treams from the low &s;wampy lands that in the dry &s;ea&s;on, as it were, drained their dregs into it, which at times were as black as ink. Be&s;ides, it was &s;towed among the pepper in the hold, which heated it to that de|gree, that every morning when the men went to take their allowance, it was &s;o hot, they could hardly bear to hold a bottleful of it in their hands; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a thing &s;carce to be credited, &s;ays Dampier, that water &s;hould be ready to boil in a &s;hip's hold."</Q> This di&s;temper was &s;o univer&s;al, that not a man in the &s;hip was wholly
<PB N="421" REF="500">
unaffected by it; &s;o that when the wind blew a hard gale, there wanted hands to work the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Captain Heath, pitying the condition of his men, di&s;tributed every day among them a quan|tity of tamarinds, &s;ome jars of which he had brought with him from India; and this was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief: but the wind coming &s;outh, and the pa&s;&s;age being already protracted to an unu&s;ual length, the Captain called the whole &s;hip's crew together, to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done in the pre&s;ent extremity, and de&s;ired every man, from the highe&s;t to the low|e&s;t, to deliver his opinion freely. Thus all cir|cum&s;tances being duly con&s;idered, it was unani|mou&s;ly agreed at la&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the wind was then contrary, to pro&s;ecute their voyage to the cape. But as that determination would in|fallibly require a more than ordinary exertion of labour from tho&s;e that were well, to &s;upply the place of tho&s;e that were &s;ick, the Captain pro|mi&s;ed a month's extra pay to every man who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t on all occa&s;ions that &s;hould require help, whether it was his watch or not; and this premium he engaged to pay at the cape. This offer was fir&s;t accepted by the Officers, and then as many men as were capable of duty entered them&s;elves upon the roll. In a &s;hort time, it plea&s;ed God, &s;ays Dampier, to favour us with a fair wind, which being improved to the be&s;t advantage by the ince&s;&s;ant labour of tho&s;e new-li&s;ted men, wafted us in a &s;hort time to the cape; and, being brought &s;afe to an anchor by the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
<PB N="422" REF="501">
of 100 Dutch &s;ailors, who unbent the &s;ails, and did every thing for us they were required to do, the &s;ick were pre&s;ently &s;ent on &s;hore, where they remained about &s;ix weeks, and all but three or four recovered.</P>
<P>On the 23d of May they &s;ailed from the cape in company with the James and Mary, and the Jo&s;iah Indiamen. They directed their cour&s;e towards the i&s;land of St. Helena, and met with nothing remarkable, except a &s;welling &s;ea, which taking them on the broad &s;ide, rolled every thing about that was loo&s;e between the decks and in the hold. This great tumbling &s;ea took them &s;oon after doubling the cape; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an eminent token, &s;ays Dampier, that the &s;outh-we&s;t winds were now violent in the higher lati|tudes towards the South Pole, we having fine clear weather all the while."</Q></P>
<P>On the 20th of June they arrived at Santa Helena, where they &s;taid four or five days, and afterwards continued their voyage to England without any remarkable incident; and arrived &s;afe in the Downs, Sept. 16, 1691.</P>
<P>What advantage Dampier and his partner Mr. Goddard made of their painted prince is not related; but they certainly &s;old him to be carried about the country to be &s;hewn for money. He was painted all down his brea&s;t, between his &s;houlders, on his thighs, and round his legs and arms like bracelets. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I cannot, &s;ays Dampier, liken the drawings to any figure of animals, or the like; but they were very curious, full
<PB N="423" REF="502">
of great variety of lines, flouri&s;hes, chequered-work, and innumerable convolutions, keeping a very graceful proportion, and appearing very artificial, even to the wonder of all that be|held him."</Q> It has already been remember|ed, that the mother of the Prince died in India of the infectious di&s;order of which he was but ju&s;t recovered when he embarked for Europe. On that occa&s;ion Dampier did what he could to comfort Jeoly, for that was the name they gave him; but he took on extremely, in&s;omuch that it was feared he could not have long &s;urvived; on which account a grave was immediately dug to hide the dead body out of his &s;ight; and being &s;hrouded decently with a piece of fine new ca|lico, the corp&s;e was about to be interred; but Jeoly was not &s;atisfied till he wrapped all his mo|ther's cloaths about her, and two new pieces of chintz that Mr. Moody gave her, &s;aying they were her's, and &s;he mu&s;t have them. After this he &s;uffered her to be interred, which was done with great &s;olemnity; but he continued to pine after her during the whole time he continued in India.</P>
<P>In the printed relation that was given of him when he was &s;hewn for a &s;ight, the &s;howmen heightened their account with a romantic &s;tory of a beautiful &s;i&s;ter of his being a &s;lave with him at Mindanao, and of the Sultan's falling in love with her, and taking her to his bed; but the&s;e were &s;tories indeed! They reported al&s;o, that the paint with which he was ornamented
<PB N="424" REF="503">
was of &s;uch virtue, that &s;erpents and all veno|mous creatures would fly from him: but poor Jeoly was as much afraid of &s;erpents, &s;corpions, and centipedes, as a little child, for he was ex|ceedingly timorous. He died at Oxford, but Dampier does not tell the year.</P>
<P>The publication of the above voyage round the world having recommended Dampier to the notice of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t eminence; he was afterwards employed by government in di&s;cove|ries, both in the Ea&s;tern and Southern Seas. His fir&s;t expedition was to the coa&s;t of New Hol|land, which could have no other object but di&s;|covery in view. He &s;ailed from the Downs, on Jan. 14, 1698, in his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Roe|buck, carrying only 12 guns, and 50 men, and having 20 months provi&s;ions on board. On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t they fell in with the we&s;tern coa&s;t of New Holland, in lat. 26 deg. S. where, how|ever, they found nothing very different from what Dampier had before de&s;cribed. The only land animals they &s;aw, were a &s;mall &s;ort of ra|coons, different from tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies chiefly in their legs, which are &s;hort before, and on which they run jumping; and a &s;ort of gua|no's, or lizards, peculiar to the country, which appear to have two heads, but in reality have but one, and no tail; and, what is no le&s;s remark|able, their four legs &s;eem to be all forelegs, &s;o formed as that the creature may walk either way. To the&s;e may now be added the kanguroo, a quadrupede of a particular &s;hape, as large as a
<PB N="425" REF="504">
&s;heep, and a creature of the oppo&s;&s;um kind, di&s;|covered by Mr. Banks; with dogs and wolves &s;een by the Endeavour's crew; of the latter &s;ort &s;ome were &s;een by Dampier's men, but &s;o lean that they were nothing but &s;kin and bone. In latitude 23 deg. S. they &s;aw dolphins, and &s;mall whales, and abundance of &s;cuttle-&s;hells, &s;wim|ming in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Captain Cook found plenty of water on the ea&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land; but Dampier was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of it on the we&s;t &s;ide. Being a&s;hore employed in digging a well, he was a&s;&s;aulted by ten or twelve of the natives, with whom he had a &s;kirmi&s;h, and was forced to &s;hoot one of them dead, to di&s;engage a young man who was &s;urrounded by three of them, and wounded in the cheek with a lance. On a gun's being fired over the heads of the a&s;&s;ailants, though it &s;tartled them at fir&s;t, they &s;oon reco|vered their &s;urprize, and continued their ho&s;ti|lities; but as &s;oon as they &s;aw a man fall, they were terribly frightened, and fled with precipi|tation. Dampier very humanely adds, that he attempted the natives no farther, being very &s;orry for what had happened.</P>
<P>Among the natives engaged on this occa&s;ion, there was one who by his appearance and car|riage &s;eemed to be the chief of them. He was a young bri&s;k man, not very tall, nor &s;o per&s;on|able as &s;ome of the re&s;t, though more active and courageous. He was painted with a circle of white pigment about his eyes, and a white &s;treak
<PB N="426" REF="505">
down his no&s;e from his forehead to the tip of it; his brea&s;t and &s;ome part of his arms were al&s;o made white with the &s;ame paint; not for beauty or ornament as it &s;hould &s;eem, but, as &s;ome wild Indian warriors are &s;aid to do, to make them|&s;elves look more terrible in war. He was indeed a very frightful being; for the manner in which he was painted, adding to his natural deformity, gave him more the appearance of a mon&s;ter of the woods, than of a man born of a woman. Dampier in this &s;econd voyage to New Holland, confirms what he &s;aid of the natives in his fir&s;t, that they are the wor&s;t featured &s;avages he ever beheld. Captain Cook, on the contrary, or his editor, a&s;&s;ures us, that their features are not di&s;|agreeable, their no&s;es are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, but univer|&s;ally cropt &s;hort: in general it is &s;traight, but &s;ometimes has a &s;mall curl; their beards are of the &s;ame colour with their hair, bu&s;hy and thick, which they &s;horten by &s;ingeing: they are of the middle &s;tature, in general well made, clean limb|ed, remarkably vigorous, active and nimble; their countenances not altogether void of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and their voices remarkably &s;oft and effeminate. Such are the different de&s;criptions given by voyagers of the &s;ame people; or, to &s;peak more preci&s;ely of people on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;ame continent; for which it is not ea&s;y to account.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="506">Our voyager, however, not being able either to find fre&s;h water, or a harbour to careen his &s;hip, &s;et &s;ail from this mi&s;erable country about the beginning of September, 1699; and, direc|ting his cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Timor, arrived there September 15, and received a &s;upply of water and provi&s;ions from the Chief of the Dutch factory there. He was likewi&s;e ho&s;pi|tably entertained by the gentlemen of the Por|tugue&s;e factory on the &s;ame i&s;land. From thence he &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of New Guinea, traded with the inhabitants, and ranging along the coa&s;t, found the main land divided into two parts. To the ea&s;ternmo&s;t divi&s;ion he gave the name of New Britain.</P>
<P>In his return back he touched again at Ti|mor, and from thence &s;ailed to Batavia; where having careened his &s;hip, and &s;upplied him&s;elf with nece&s;&s;aries of every kind, on the 17th of October, 1700, he &s;et &s;ail for the Cape of Good Hope; from thence continuing his voyage to St. Helena, he arrived at that i&s;land January 31, 1701; but in his cour&s;e home his &s;hip &s;prung a leak at &s;ea, and, after endeavouring in vain to &s;top it, he was obliged to run her a-ground on the i&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion; where having landed his men, and taken from on board all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, they in a &s;hort time di&s;covered a fine &s;pring of water, and lived tolerably, till they were at la&s;t relieved by &s;ome Engli&s;h men-of-war, who were convoying home the Canterbury Indiaman, and brought them all &s;afe to England.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="507">In 1703, notwith&s;tanding the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage ju&s;t mentioned, Dampier was again employed in an expedition to the South Sea, in conjunction with Captain Pulling, who had each a &s;hip of 26 guns, and 120 men under his com|mand. That commanded by Captain Dampier was called the St. George; and that by Captain Pulling, the Fame. They were victualled for nine months, and had commi&s;&s;ions from his Royal Highne&s;s Prince George of Denmark, then Lord High Admiral, to proceed in a war|like manner again&s;t the French and Spaniards; and both were upon the &s;ame terms of, <HI>No pur|cha&s;e no pay.</HI> But while they were in the Downs, &s;ome difference having ari&s;en between the two Captains, Captain Pulling &s;et &s;ail alone, and left Dampier to take his own cour&s;e; who, &s;topping &s;ome time in Ireland, was joined by the Cinque Ports galley of 90 tons, 16 guns, and 63 men, Captain Charles Pickering Commander. In this expedition, Dampier had three grand objects in view: the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was, to &s;ail to Buenos Ayres, in order to &s;urprize the Spani&s;h galleons that u&s;ually take in their lading at that port; the <HI>&s;econd</HI> de|pended on mi&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t, in which ca&s;e they were to pa&s;s through the &s;traits of Magellan to crui&s;e upon the coa&s;ts of Peru, for the Baldivia &s;hips that carry gold to Lima; and the <HI>third</HI> was only to take place, if both the former mi&s;|carried; and was, to proceed to the coa&s;t of Mexico, to intercept the Manilla &s;hip that an|nually arrives at Acapulco, and is &s;aid to be
<PB N="429" REF="508">
worth eight or nine millions of pieces of eight, equal to a million and a half of our money.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e projects, they &s;et &s;ail from Kin|&s;ale, in Ireland, on the 11th of September, 1703, and on the 25th arrived off Madeira, where they learned that the galleons were &s;ailed from Buenos Ayres, and then lay at Teneriff. The fir&s;t pro|ject being thus defeated, they proceeded to put the &s;econd in execution with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. On the 24th of November they anchored on the i&s;land Le Grand, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, where they buried Captain Pickering, and cho&s;e Lieu|tenant Stradling in his room.</P>
<P>From this i&s;land they &s;ailed the 8th of Decem|ber; and, doubling Cape Horn on the 20th of January, they changed their direction, &s;ailed to the northward, and on the 10th of February came to an anchor in the great bay of Juan Fernandez, where they met their con&s;ort Captain Stradling, with whom they had parted in pa&s;&s;ing Cape Horn in a violent &s;torm, which happened on the 26th of January.</P>
<P>At Juan Fernandez they continued refitting their &s;hips till the 29th, when &s;eeing a &s;ail, they &s;lipt their cables, and put to &s;ea. She proved to be a French &s;hip of 400 tons, 30 guns, and full of men. The St. George fought her about &s;even hours, when a gale &s;pringing up, &s;he &s;heer|ed off. On this occa&s;ion, the Cinque Ports be|haved but indifferently, firing only a few guns, and lying by.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="509">Next day, in returning to Juan Fernandez, they fell in with two French men-of-war of 36 guns each; from whom they narrowly e&s;caped, leaving their cables, anchors, and five or &s;ix of their men belonging to the Cinque Ports on that i&s;land, with a new &s;uit of &s;ails, and &s;everal other nece&s;&s;aries which they could ill &s;pare.</P>
<P>They now proceeded upon their &s;econd enter|prize; but they were equally unfortunate in that as in the former. The Baldivian &s;hips were &s;ail|ed, and the gold &s;ecured. They then meditated a &s;urprize again&s;t the town of Santa Maria, in the gulph of Panama, where the Spaniards getting intelligence of their de&s;igns, laid ambu&s;cades, and after killing and wounding &s;everal of them, put the re&s;t to flight.</P>
<P>In this manner, di&s;appointments &s;ucceeding di&s;appointments, differences began to ari&s;e be|tween the Commanders; and they concluded to part company. But about this time, a large &s;hip, fortunately for them, coming to an anchor in the night clo&s;e by them, they in&s;tantly boarded and made prize of her. She was deeply laden with flour, &s;ugar, brandy, wine, about thirty tons of malmalade of quinces, a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;alt, with &s;ome tons of linnen and woolen-cloth. This proved a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply; and provi&s;ions that were before &s;o &s;carce, that only five green plantains were the daily allowance for &s;ix men, were now &s;o abundant on board the prize, that they might have laid in a &s;tock for &s;everal years; yet in le&s;s than &s;ix months we find them &s;tarving.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="510">After rummaging the prize and dividing the &s;poil, the Captains parted; and in two or three days, Dampier fell in with a Spani&s;h man-of-war, fitted out on purpo&s;e to take him. The two &s;hips had a &s;mart engagement, and parted in the night by con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Soon after this engagement, Dampier and Clippington, his fir&s;t Lieutenant, having &s;ome difference, Clippington &s;eized upon the &s;hip's tender, in which were the &s;tores and ammunition, and with 21 of the be&s;t men weighed anchor, and &s;et &s;ail. When he had cleared the i&s;lands, he &s;ent to invite all tho&s;e who were willing to &s;ail with him to come on board; but Dampier's la&s;t project being now on the point of being car|ried into execution, the men who remained with him re&s;olved to abide the i&s;&s;ue. Clippington, though he had quarrelled with the Captain, had no mind to di&s;tre&s;s the men; he therefore thought fit to re&s;tore the powder and ammuni|tion, re&s;erving only enough for his own u&s;e. In the bay of Tacames, Dampier had taken a &s;mall bark of 60 tons, laden with plantains. This bark they intended to keep as a tender. She had two ma&s;ts, with two &s;quare &s;ails; and they named her the Dragon.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of this bark, Chri&s;tian Martin by name, was a Spaniard by birth, but taken pri&s;o|ner while he was a boy, and bred up in Eng|land. This man they kept pri&s;oner on board; and now proceeded to intercept the Manilla &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="511">On the 6th of December in the morning, they &s;aw a &s;ail, and &s;oon came up with her. She prov|ed their la&s;t hope, the great Manilla &s;hip, from the Ea&s;t-Indies. They in&s;tantly bore down upon her, and before &s;he could bring her guns to bear gave her &s;everal broad-&s;ides; and, taking her un|prepared, put the company on board in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;order. Captain Martin, though a Spa|niard, advi&s;ed to lay her aboard immediately, before the Spaniards had recovered their &s;ur|prize; but that advice was di&s;regarded till it was too late; for while two parties were quar|relling on board the St. George, the one for lay|ing the enemy on board, the other not, the Spa|niards got out a tier of 24 pounders, every one of which that took place was ready to &s;end the St. George to the bottom. The a&s;&s;ailants were therefore &s;oon beaten off with di&s;grace, after having received a &s;hot between wind and water in the powder room, by which two feet of plank|ing was driven in on each &s;ide the &s;tern. And now, being di&s;appointed of this their la&s;t expecta|tion, all the men grew di&s;contented, and impa|tient to return home. However, they were pre|vailed upon to crui&s;e a few weeks longer on the coa&s;t of Mexico; and with that view pa&s;&s;ed the ports of Acapulco, Port Angels, Port Guatulco, and &s;everal others; but without meeting with any prize worth waiting for.</P>
<P>Ill &s;ucce&s;s is generally &s;ucceeded by di&s;con|tent; the men who were before impatient of fa|tigue without reward, grew now ungovernable.
<PB N="433" REF="512">
A party, therefore, formed the de&s;ign of return|ing home by way of the Ea&s;t-Indies; and the&s;e were encouraged by Mr. Funnel, the chief mate, who, having the command of the &s;mall Spani&s;h prize alreadly mentioned, determined to hazard every thing to regain his native country, rather than continue under the direction of a man with whom there was no keeping terms. He there|fore embraced the fir&s;t opportunity to reach the gulph of Amapalla, to new-water his bark, and prepare for his voyage home.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, that this voyage of Dampier, though countenanced with a government com|mi&s;&s;ion, was notwith&s;tanding fitted out by pri|vate adventurers; for, on this occa&s;ion, the owners agent is &s;aid to have divided the provi|&s;ions and &s;tores between tho&s;e who cho&s;e to re|main with Dampier, and tho&s;e who determined to follow the fortune of Mr. Funnel. Their whole number was already reduced to 60 effec|tive men, 33 of whom cho&s;e to accompany Fun|nel, and 27 only remained with Dampier, but upon what terms they engaged, or what cour&s;e they pur&s;ued afterwards, we are not told; for Dampier, though he returned home, never pub|li&s;hed any account of this voyage. What we have related concerning it, in order to complete his adventures, as far as our materials extend, we have extracted from the account publi&s;hed by Funnel; who, having left Dampier in the gulph of Amapalla, on the 1&s;t of February, 1705, takes no farther notice of his Captain; but goes
<PB N="434" REF="513">
on with the &s;tory of his own voyage, which was indeed unfortunate enough; for his &s;hip was &s;eized by the Dutch at Amboyna, the goods on board confi&s;cated, and mo&s;t of the men cruelly u&s;ed, being confined and half-&s;tarved by our good friends the Dutch, who were jealous le&s;t they &s;hould make di&s;coveries prejudicial to their commerce. Funnel him&s;elf, however, &s;oon got relea&s;ed; and, having made &s;trong repre&s;enta|tions again&s;t the authors of his &s;ufferings at Amboyna, he at length obtained &s;ome &s;hew of redre&s;s; with which, though not a compen&s;ation for his lo&s;&s;es, he was forced to be contented. On the 2d of November he, with two of his com|pany, got pa&s;&s;age to Europe in the Dutch Ea&s;t-India fleet; and, on the 15th of July following, arrived &s;afe in the Texel, from whence, after vi&s;iting the principal towns in Holland, he came to England, and publi&s;hed the account ju&s;t mentioned, in which he followed the example of Dampier, by giving a de&s;cription of the natural productions of the i&s;lands at which he touched, their inhabitants, arts, and commerce.</P>
<P>We can find no traces of the latter part of the life of Dampier, who &s;eems to have been an able navigator, but of a re&s;tle&s;s turbulent &s;pirit, like the ocean on which he was bred. He certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of &s;ailing in a very eminent de|gree; but he wanted that happier art of concili|ating the wavering di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions of his fol|lowers and a&s;&s;ociates. He &s;eems, too, to have been more cautious than brave, more &s;ubtle
<PB N="435" REF="514">
than wi&s;e, and more enterprizing than fortunate. In all his engagements, both as an inferior offi|cer and as a commander, he &s;eems neither to have braved danger nor to have feared it. It is not ea&s;y to determine, whether his thir&s;t for gold, or de&s;ire of knowledge, was the governing prin|ciple that led him to range the world for new di&s;coveries. If the former, he &s;eems totally to have failed in the pur&s;uit; if the latter, he was more &s;ucce&s;sful. At Mindanao, we find him poor; at the Ba&s;hee i&s;lands he laments the want of every article that could purcha&s;e from the na|tives a &s;mall &s;pecimen of the yellow metal that bore the re&s;emblance of gold; but withal &s;o ho|ne&s;t, that he would neither take the iron belong|ing to the owners of the &s;hip to give in exchange, nor would he take the metal from the inhabitants without an equivalent. In &s;hort, I think, we may conclude, from what he him&s;elf has written, that Dampier was a man of &s;trong natural parts, of blunt manners, of quick di&s;cernment, inflexible in his re&s;olutions, but deficient in natural qua|lities to command re&s;pect, and in acquired abi|lities to maintain it.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGE OF MASTER COWLEY ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>OF Ma&s;ter Cowley we can find no other account than what is contained in the voyage written by him&s;elf; therefore, we &s;hall, in his own words, pre&s;erve &s;uch parts of that voyage as have not already been related in the voyage of Dampier; premi&s;ing only, that his fir&s;t &s;etting out among the buccaneers was in the &s;ame prize, in which Dampier &s;et &s;ail from Virginia, under the command of Captain Cook; that he continued to &s;erve that Commander, as Ma&s;ter, during his life; and that, after &s;ailing &s;ometime in con&s;ort with Captain Eaton in the South Seas, he cho&s;e rather to &s;erve that gentleman than to continue with his own Cap|tain's &s;ucce&s;&s;or. One remark more, and then to proceed. We find him, in every collection of voyages in which he is introduced, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of CAPTAIN Cowley, though the highe&s;t employment to which he ever &s;eems to have arrived, was Ma&s;ter on board the buc|caneers before-mentioned; who, during the time they were &s;uffered to commit their ra|vages, traver&s;ed the globe as wolves the fo|re&s;t,
<PB N="437" REF="516">
merely for the &s;ake of whom they might devour. We find, however, but few of them &s;ucce&s;sful; by far the greate&s;t part, like other robbers, died mi&s;erably; and &s;uch of them as e&s;caped with life, were, at certain times, ex|po&s;ed to &s;ufferings not le&s;s &s;hocking to human nature, than the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which they reduc|ed innocent people by their cruelty and lu&s;t for gold. But now to proceed:</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t, 1683, I departed, &s;ays Cowley, from Cape Charles in Virginia, lying in latitude 36 deg. N. and in longitude 305 deg. in the good &s;hip called the Revenge, Captain John Cook, Commander, pretending to me, that I &s;hould navigate the &s;hip to Petitguavaz, where a Frenchman was the Governor, and to which port I began to &s;hape my cour&s;e; but was told, as &s;oon as we had left the &s;hore, that they were now bound for the coa&s;t of Guinea, to provide a bet|ter &s;hip; and that then their de&s;ign was to &s;ail to the Great South Sea. I was thereupon ob|liged to alter my cour&s;e, and to &s;teer E. S. E. for the Cape de Verd I&s;lands in lat. 16 deg. N.</P>
<P>In the month of September, we made the i&s;land of Salt, where we came to an anchor, careened our &s;hip, and afterwards &s;ailed to St. Nicholas, where was held a con&s;ultation of of|ficers, whether to &s;ail directly for the South Seas in their pre&s;ent &s;hip, or pur&s;ue their former re&s;olution and proceed to the coa&s;t of Guinea to &s;eek a better. After much debate, it was at length concluded, to try St. Jago, another of the
<PB N="438" REF="517">
Cape de Verd i&s;lands, and, if any &s;hip was found in that road fit for their purpo&s;e, to lay her on board, and make her their prize.</P>
<P>On our approach to this i&s;land on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, we de&s;cried a large &s;hip from the ma&s;t-head, which proved to be a Dutch Ea&s;t India|man of 50 guns, and, as we afterwards learnt, of 400 men, mo&s;t of whom were on &s;hore; but on &s;eeing us &s;tand towards the road, they in&s;tantly repaired to their po&s;ts, clapt a &s;pring upon their cable, heaved their broad&s;ide to us, &s;truck out their ports below, and running out their lower tier of guns, made them&s;elves ready to receive us. We had now advanced too near; but marking their force, and that it was in vain to attempt a conque&s;t, we put before the wind, and &s;teered directly to the coa&s;t of Guinea, where we had no &s;ooner arrived, than we fell in with a new &s;hip of 40 guns, which we boarded, and car|ried away. Upon examination, we found her well &s;tored with brandy, water, and provi&s;ions; and in order to furni&s;h her with other nece&s;&s;aries from our old &s;hip, we put into Sherborough, re|&s;olving to touch at no other port till we &s;hould come to Juan Fernandez, in lat. 33 deg. 40 min. S.</P>
<P>About the beginning of December, we &s;ail|ed from latitude 8 deg. N. &s;teering S. W. till we arrived in 12 deg, S. when we &s;teered away S. W. by W. till we came into &s;oundings on the coa&s;t of Brazil; and finding 80 fathom water in a &s;andy bank, we altered our cour&s;e to the S. W. and about the latitude of 40 deg. S. found the
<PB N="439" REF="518">
&s;ea as red as blood, occa&s;ioned by great &s;hoals of &s;hrimps, which coloured the ocean, for many leagues together. We found al&s;o a multitude of &s;eals, and &s;uch abundance of &s;mall whales as to exceed the number found in the North Seas in the proportion of one hundred to ten. We held on our cour&s;e till we came into lat. 47 deg. where we &s;aw land, never before di&s;covered. It proved an uninhabited i&s;land, to which I gave the name of Pepy's i&s;land, and at which &s;hips may conveniently wood and water, having a harbour where 1000 &s;ail may ride in &s;afety. In this i&s;land we &s;aw plenty of fowls, and round it there is no doubt abundance of fi&s;h; but, it blowing a &s;torm, we could neither dare to approach it, nor to examine its coa&s;ts. We therefore &s;tood to the &s;outhward, &s;haping our cour&s;e S. S. W. till we came into the latitude of 50 deg. S. and then &s;teering S. W. by W. re&s;olving not to at|tempt the &s;traits of Magellan, but to make the land of Ter del Fuego; and there, finding great riplings, and apprehending danger, we re&s;olved to attempt the pa&s;&s;age di&s;covered by Bartholomew Sharp, in 1681, and to &s;ail round all, leaving Staten land to the N. With this view, hauling away S. W. we came a-brea&s;t of Cape Horn on the 14th of February, where, chu&s;ing valentines, and di&s;cour&s;ing of the witchcraft of women, there aro&s;e a prodigious &s;torm, which continued till the la&s;t day of the month, driving us into latitude 60 deg. 30 min. which is farther than any &s;hip ever yet &s;ailed to
<PB N="440" REF="519">
the &s;outh; &s;o that we concluded that talking of the wiles of women at &s;ea was very unlucky di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>About the beginning of March, the wind coming to the &s;outh, we were &s;oon wafted into a warmer climate; for in the 60th deg. the wea|ther was &s;o extremely cold, that we could bear drinking three quarts of burnt brandy a man in four-and-twenty hours, without being the lea&s;t intoxicated. We &s;teered north-by-ea&s;t till we came into lat. 40 deg. S. where we fell in with the Nicholas of London, Captain John Eaton Commander; and, being glad of each others company, we &s;ailed in con&s;ort&s;hip to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, where we found plenty of good fat goats, good fi&s;h, wood, and water. [Here Cowley relates the &s;tory of the Mo&s;kito-man, the account of which has already been given by Dam|pier.] This i&s;land is naturally fortified; &s;o that with 100 men, and at 100 l. expence, it may be defended from the attacks of 2000 men, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion. [Accordingly the Spaniards have taken the hint; for when the la&s;t &s;hips &s;ailed upon di&s;coveries, they found it fortified.] It lies 110 leagues due we&s;t from the port of Valparay&s;o.</P>
<P>We &s;teered from this i&s;land north-north-ea&s;t, till we made the high land of Arica, in latitude 18 deg. S. Being before the bay, the officers of both &s;hips held a con&s;ultation whether be&s;t to go into Arica-bay, or proceed farther on the coa&s;t; when it was re&s;olved to &s;ail as low down

at Cape Blanco, and there wait for the Spani&s;h plate-fleet coming to the bay of Panama. This was an unfortunate re&s;olution; for in Arica-bay rode at that time a &s;hip with 300 tons of &s;ilver on board, which we mi&s;&s;ed, and in the room of her took a timber-&s;hip bound to Lima, with 30 hands on board, which at that time &s;tockt us with more mouths than we could well &s;pare meat to fill. With this &s;hip we &s;ailed away north to the i&s;land of Lobos, in lat. 7 deg. S. where we &s;et our &s;ick men on &s;hore, though we could neither find wood or water upon it. Here having heeled our &s;hips, at a general council it was re&s;olved, to attack the town of Truxillo, in lat. 8 deg. N. ten miles within land; and with this view ju&s;t as we were weighing anchor to proceed, &s;ome of our people from the ma&s;t head e&s;pied three &s;ail of &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing by, which we in&s;tantly ran out and took. The&s;e &s;hips were all laden with flour, fruit, and &s;weet-meats; but having had intelli|gence that we were upon the coa&s;t, they had left all their &s;ilver (their &s;ilver-&s;ervice plate not ex|cepted) on &s;hore. Their provi&s;ions, however, were very acceptable; and we now thought only of &s;eeking a proper place to lay up our &s;tores in &s;ecurity, and where we might conceal our&s;elves for five or &s;ix months, to make the enemy believe that we had for&s;aken their &s;eas, and that they had nothing to fear from fre&s;h at|tacks. On this occa&s;ion, the i&s;lands called by the Spaniards Gallapagoes, or Enchanted I&s;lands, were propo&s;ed, and the only objection made was,
<PB N="442" REF="522">
the uncertainty of finding them; but that being overcome, we weighed anchor, and after three weeks &s;ail came in &s;ight of them, being &s;even|teen in number, to all which I gave di&s;tinct names. We came to an anchor in a very good harbour, lying towards the northernmo&s;t end of a fine i&s;land under the Equinoctial Line, in which we found plenty of fi&s;h, &s;ea and land-tortoi&s;es, fowls of various &s;orts, among which were turtle-doves, &s;o tame at fir&s;t that they would often light upon the hats and &s;houlders of our men as they walked abroad; but not being able to &s;atisfy their hungry appetite by catching them alive, the &s;ailors &s;o &s;cared them at la&s;t, by frequently firing upon them, that they became, like other birds, very &s;hy.</P>
<P>This i&s;land I called the Duke of York's I&s;land, near to which lies a &s;mall i&s;land, which being viewed in &s;everal directions, always a&s;&s;umed a different &s;hape. This I called Cowley's Enchant|ed I&s;land. I examined &s;everal others; but upon none of them found fre&s;h-water, &s;ave only upon the Duke of York's I&s;land. The bay in which we anchored I called Albany bay, and the har|bour York-road; and, after having laid up 1500 bags of flour, with a quantity of &s;weet-meats, and other provi&s;ions, in a convenient &s;tore-room, we &s;ailed to the northward, to try for fre&s;h water a &s;econd time; le&s;t, being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, we &s;hould be forced, upon &s;ome future occa&s;ion, to &s;eek relief in other harbours, when it might not be po&s;&s;ible for us to reach the pre&s;ent; but we
<PB N="443" REF="523">
found good water in none of them; and, to our great &s;urprize, we met with &s;uch a violent cur|rent, that when we would have returned to the Duke of York's I&s;land, we could not &s;tem it; and we were obliged to bear away N. N. E. when the fir&s;t land we made upon the main was Cape Tre&s;pontas, upon the ea&s;ternmo&s;t &s;hore of which we watered our &s;hip. The fir&s;t day after our arrival, we buried our Captain; the &s;econd day, three Spani&s;h Indians came down, whom our men brought on board. Being &s;trictly examined concerning the &s;trength and opulence of the town of Ria Lexa, they gave very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers: but, while they were under examination, our long-boat being &s;ent on &s;hore to get beef, a party of Spani&s;h Indians came down, and &s;et their boat on fire, and drove the crew for &s;helter upon a rock, where they were forced to remain till we &s;ent another boat with 20 men to re&s;cue them.</P>
<P>We retained the three Indians, and led them with ropes about their necks as guides to con|duct us afterwards to Ria Lexa; but one of them having got his neck out of the collar, made his e&s;cape, and alarmed the town; &s;o that our men returned very much di&s;couraged at this &s;econd di&s;appointment. We now found it nece&s;&s;ary to turn all our pri&s;oners away to &s;hift for them|&s;elves; and then directed our cour&s;e to the gulph of St. Miguel, where we took two i&s;lands, one inhabited by Indians, the other plentifully &s;tock|ed with cattle; but for gold and &s;ilver, we got but little. Here we &s;taid and careened our &s;hips;
<PB N="444" REF="524">
and here Captain Cook's &s;hip and Captain Ea|ton's broke con&s;ort&s;hip; and, both &s;hips being refitted, I got on board Captain Eaton, where I was entertained as his ma&s;ter, to navigate his &s;hip to any place or port where he &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>[It is now that the voyage of Ma&s;ter Cowley may be &s;aid to commence. Hitherto he has gone hand-in-hand with Dampier; but now Cowley pur&s;ues one cour&s;e with Captain Eaton, and Dampier another with Captain Davis, the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of Captain Cook.]</P>
<P>We in our &s;hip, continues Cowley, towards the middle of Augu&s;t, &s;et &s;ail from the gulph of Miguel [in the bay of Amapalla], &s;teering for Cape St. Franci&s;co, where we chaced a &s;hip that e&s;caped from us; and then we bore up to lati|tude 7 deg. S. where finding the country alarm|ed, we &s;tood for Payta, in lat. 5 deg. S. where we took two &s;hips lying at anchor; which the Spaniards refu&s;ing to ran&s;om, we, by way of farewel, &s;et them on fire. From hence we &s;ail|ed to Gorgona, at which i&s;land we watered our &s;hip for the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>This i&s;land lies in lat. 3 deg. 15 min. N. and in long. 305 deg. E. and as &s;oon as we had &s;up|plied our&s;elves with wood and water, we took our departure, &s;teering W. N. W. till we came as low almo&s;t as the rocks of St. Bartholomew, in long. 240 deg. then we &s;ailed into lat. 15 deg. N. till we judged we were pa&s;t tho&s;e rocks; and then returned into 13 deg. N. which latitude we held till we made the i&s;land of Guam, in lat.
<PB N="445" REF="525">
13 deg. N. and in long. 150 deg. E. according to our reckoning; at which i&s;land, when we arriv|ed, we had a very &s;ickly &s;hip, no man being free from the &s;curvy, and mo&s;t of us in a con&s;uming condition. It was on the 14th of March about &s;even in the morning that we &s;aw land. At 12 o'clock we were in lat. 13 deg. 2 min. N. by ob|&s;ervation, having made out on our &s;ailing, by judgment, 7646 miles, that is to &s;ay, departed &s;o many miles from Gorgona by lo&s;s made out in longitude, which is about 2549 leagues. The next day we &s;ailed about the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the i&s;land, and came to an anchor in a fair bay, from whence we &s;ent a boat on &s;hore, with a flag of truce; but, on landing, our people found that the natives had burnt their hou&s;es, and had fled; however, our men felled &s;ome cocoa-nut trees, and brought a hundred or two of them on board to refre&s;h the crew. In the mean time a party of Indians ru&s;hed from behind the bu&s;hes, and in a ho&s;tile manner threatened to attack us; but we made &s;igns of friend&s;hip, and one of the In|dians returned to the wood, and having peeled a &s;tick &s;o as to make it appear white, he came forward, when one of his companions perceiving that he had no cap to compliment our people, called him back, and pre&s;ented him with one for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From Sunday the 15th till Tue&s;day the 17th, we continued a free trade with the Indians; but on that day our men going over to a &s;mall i&s;land on the we&s;t &s;ide of Guam, the Indians fell upon
<PB N="446" REF="526">
them with &s;tones and lances, which occa&s;ioned a fray, in which &s;ome of the Indians were killed upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Two days after, the Governor, who happened to be a Spaniard, came to a point of land near the &s;hip, and &s;ent a letter written in Spani&s;h, French, and Dutch, demanding in the name of the King his Ma&s;ter, who we were, whither we were bound, and from whence we came? Our an&s;wer was written in French, that we were em|ployed by &s;ome gentlemen in France upon the di&s;covery of the unknown parts of the world. On the return of the me&s;&s;enger, the Governor &s;ent a letter of invitation to the Capta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n to come on &s;hore, with which he in&s;tantly complied, and was received under a triple di&s;charge of cannon from the fort, which was an&s;wered by the &s;ame number of guns from the &s;hip. They &s;oon came to a good under&s;tanding. Our Captain made an apology for killing &s;ome of the Indians in his own defence; and the Governor gave for an&s;wer, that, if he had killed them all, he &s;hould have e&s;teemed the favour the greater. We were after|wards told, that the Indians on the &s;mall i&s;land were in rebellion.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, about 12 o'clock, a Spani&s;h Captain came on board, and continued with us till 12 the next day. He brought as a pre&s;ent from the Governor 10 hogs, a large quantity of potatoes, plantains, oranges, papas, and red pepper; in return for which our Commander
<PB N="447" REF="527">
&s;ent the Governor a diamond-ring, and pre&s;ent|ed the Officer with a rich &s;word.</P>
<P>The next day the Governor &s;ent on board a captain, a Je&s;uit, and a friar, with a reque&s;t to our Commander to &s;pare him &s;ome powder, of which he was in want. This reque&s;t was readily complied with; we &s;ent him four bar|rels, and offered him four great guns. The fir&s;t he thankfully received, and &s;ent a box in which were 1600 pieces of eight in gold and &s;ilver for the Captain to pay him&s;elf for the powder; but the guns he politely declined ac|cepting. Our Captain returned the box with the money untouched, and afterwards received from the Governor a valuable pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>While mutual civilities were pa&s;&s;ing between the Governor and our Captain, our people went out every day cha&s;ing the Indians, whom they had full licence to kill and de&s;troy wherever they met with them; but they, finding us not to be Spaniards, became very tractable, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upplying us with fi&s;h and fruit, which they exchanged with us for old nails and old iron. After having tarried here &s;ome|time, and a free intercour&s;e had been e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Indians on &s;hore and our people on board the &s;hip, the Indians made &s;igns for as many of our men as cho&s;e it, to come and &s;ee them haul the &s;eine. Our men, not &s;u&s;pect|ing any de&s;ign, manned the boat, and went to look at them; but, while the men were amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the &s;port, the Indians had very
<PB N="448" REF="528">
artfully brought their &s;eine round the boat, with a de&s;ign to draw it on &s;hore, and thereby en|tangle both boat and crew; but the &s;ailors, di&s;|covering the plot, gave the Indians no time to carry it into execution; for, being provided with fire-arms, which they never went a&s;hore without, they fired among&s;t the thicke&s;t of them, killed a great many, and drove the re&s;t away.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians are large in &s;tature, &s;ome of them being &s;even feet and a half high; they go &s;tark naked; never bury their dead, but let them lie in the &s;un to rot. They have no arms but &s;lings and lances; the &s;harp ends of the latter are pointed with dead mens bones, which, being cut like &s;coops, and jagged at the edges like unto &s;aws, if a man happens to be wounded by them, and is not cured in nine days, he certainly dies. Our people took four of the&s;e treacherous &s;avages pri&s;oners, bound them, and brought them on board; but they had not been long among us, before three of them leapt into the &s;ea, and with their hands tied behind them &s;wam away like fi&s;hes. However, we &s;ent the boat after them, and found that a &s;trong man at the fir&s;t blow could not penetrate their &s;kins with a cutla&s;s. One of them, in my judgment, had received 40 bullets in his body before he died; and the la&s;t of the three that was killed, &s;wam a good Engli&s;h mile, not only with his hands tied behind him, but with his arms pinioned, before he expired.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="529">The Spani&s;h Governor's kindne&s;s increa&s;ed in proportion to the mi&s;chief done to the Indians. He &s;ent us, the &s;ucceeding day, by one of his captains, thirty hogs, &s;ome melons, pumpkins, potatoes, fruits, and rice; and received in return &s;ix &s;mall patararoes.</P>
<P>Having now new rigged our &s;hip, and &s;up|plied our&s;elves with wood and water, we began to prepare for our departure. On the fir&s;t of April, we weighed anchor, and next day came a-brea&s;t of the fort, which we &s;aluted with three guns, and were complimented with the &s;ame number; and on the 3d the Governor &s;ent his la&s;t pre&s;ent to our Captain. On the 4th we &s;et &s;ail, and &s;teered W. by S. till we arrived at the height of St. Bartholomew, when we &s;haped our cour&s;e W. N. W. till we came into the latitude of 20 deg. 30 min. N. where we fell in with a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands lying to the north of Luconia, di&s;tant from Guam 560 leagues. They &s;eemed to be uninhabited; but the men who went a&s;hore in the boat, found abundance of nutmegs on one of them, and &s;aw &s;ome goats.</P>
<P>From the&s;e i&s;lands we &s;teered S. W. for the i&s;land of Luconia, and on the 26th of April Cape Bajadore bore from us ea&s;t; after which we came up with Cape Mindato, where the S. W. mon&s;oon overtaking us, we were obliged to bear away for Canton in China, where we lay and re|fitted our &s;hip, and where we might have laden our&s;elves with plunder from thirteen Tartar &s;hips, who came thither full of the riche&s;t goods
<PB N="450" REF="530">
of China: but our men, being under no go|vernment, refu&s;ed to attack them; &s;aying, They came for gold and &s;ilver, not to be made pedlars to carry packs. But, alas! had rea&s;on prevailed, we might have all made our fortunes, without injuring any prince or &s;ubject in chri&s;ten|dom; for the&s;e goods the Tartars had taken from the Chine&s;e about two years before, and had &s;tored them at Macao, an i&s;land near Can|ton, to be taken away when they judged it con|venient.</P>
<P>From Canton we &s;ailed for Manilla, to wait for the Tartar &s;hip that annually goes thither, and which, we were informed, was laden one half with &s;ilver; but, tho' we were fortunate enough to come in &s;ight of her, yet &s;he out-&s;ailed us, and e&s;caped. We then bore away for an i&s;land that lies to the north of Luconia, intending there to &s;tay till the wind came fair to carry us to Bantam, not then knowing that Bantam had been taken from the Engli&s;h by the Dutch.</P>
<P>At this i&s;land we &s;tored our&s;elves with fruit, goats, and guanos; which la&s;t are here good meat: and here we found an Indian who di|rected us to an i&s;land, where there was plenty of great cattle; but the wind &s;oon coming fair, we made &s;ail to the &s;outhward, &s;teering our cour&s;e S. S. W. till we came into lat. 10 deg. N. where we were &s;o entangled among the i&s;lands of Pa|ragoa, that none of us ever expected to e&s;cape with life. After three days, however, we very
<PB N="451" REF="531">
providentially got clear; and &s;tood in for an i&s;land at the north end of Borneo, where we hauled our &s;hip a&s;hore, and erected a tent, planting a battery of ten guns for our defence, in ca&s;e of an attack from the natives. Here we unloaded our &s;hip, and, having provided &s;uffi|ciently for our &s;ecurity, we ranged the country for natives to trade with us; but they, having never &s;een any white men before, were very &s;hy; and when, by chance, our men fell in with one of their canoes that was full of women, (among whom was the queen of the country and her re|tinue) on the approach of our &s;hip's boat, they all leapt over-board; but, after taking them up, and treating them kindly, they laid a&s;ide their fears, and grew familiar; and, upon our offering them civility, in&s;tead of avoiding, they &s;oon became fond of us. They brought us fi&s;h in great plenty, with oranges, lemons, mangoes, plantains, and pine-apples; and, be&s;ides the&s;e, we exchanged &s;ome trifles for bezoar, mu&s;k, and civet, with which the i&s;land is well &s;tored.</P>
<P>The year was now drawing to a clo&s;e, when we &s;et &s;ail from this little i&s;land, directing our cour&s;e for Timor, where, finding the &s;hip's com|pany begin to grow mutinous, and not under command of their Captain, my&s;elf, Mr. Hill, and eighteen more, joined our forces together, and purcha&s;ed a large boat, in which we &s;ailed to the i&s;land of Java, di&s;tant from Timor 300 leagues. The wind being contrary to carry us to Batavia, we bore away for Cheribon, a factory
<PB N="452" REF="532">
belonging to the Dutch, lying ea&s;tward of Ba|tavia, where we were kindly received by the Go|vernor. There we heard that King Charles was dead; and that his brother James was proclaim|ed king; we heard al&s;o that Bantam had been taken from the Engli&s;h; and that the Dutch had erected a new factory in that i&s;land.</P>
<P>After refre&s;hing at Cheribon, we agreed to divide our twenty men into three parties; two of which cho&s;e to &s;ail for the bay of Bengal, and the third to &s;tay with me; but knowing that Batavia was the Hollander's magazine for India, we propo&s;ed fir&s;t to &s;ail thither, and there to pro|vide for our&s;elves as well as we could. Being all arrived, we were courteou&s;ly received by the General; and I, with Mr. Hill and another friend, who were all my party, were promi&s;ed our pa&s;&s;age to Europe in their Ea&s;t-India fleet. About this time the General was &s;ending four or five &s;hips of war, with &s;oldiers, to procure &s;a|tisfaction from the King of the i&s;land, for an outrage that had been committed on a party of Hollanders, who, to the number of 80, had been &s;laughtered by the Javane&s;e. The&s;e &s;hips, it &s;eems, were originally de&s;igned again&s;t Sille|bar, an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Sumatra; but this act of ho&s;tility happening to intervene, it had diverted their purpo&s;e, and &s;aved the factory for this time. There were now in Batavia twenty of us, who, on hearing this news, would willingly have repaired to Sil|lebar; but the Dutch would by no means permit
<PB N="453" REF="533">
us, though we had bought a &s;loop for that pur|po&s;e. When we were ju&s;t ready to &s;ail, the Ge|neral ordered our &s;loop to be &s;eized; and when we remon&s;trated again&s;t this incivility, they pro|duced an old law, by which the &s;ubjects of the republic in India are forbidden to &s;ell any ve&s;&s;el to any foreigner; and they even went &s;o far as to impri&s;on tho&s;e who had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it. To us, indeed, they gave the prime co&s;t of the &s;loop, but paid us nothing for fitting her up.</P>
<P>This project failing, Mr. Hill, another friend, and I, embarked on board the <HI>Solida</HI> Indiaman, bound to Holland; and, as we were putting out of the road, we &s;aw our &s;hip Captain John Eaton coming in; however, we held our cour&s;e; but finding the wind unfavourable, we turned down to Bantam to take in provi&s;ions, and from thence &s;teered to Prince's I&s;land, where we lay for a fair wind three weeks. About the end of March, we &s;et &s;ail from thence, with the wind at N. W. and &s;haped our cour&s;e to the Cape of Good Hope. On the 11th of May, after a plea|&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, we made the land called Point Pri|micra, bearing from us N. W. di&s;tant 12 leagues. We had the wind at N. E. being di&s;tant from the cape 560 miles, the land trending away S. W. by W. The fi&s;h which came about the &s;hip near the i&s;land of Mona, the 30th of March, left us now, when we judged our&s;elves in latitude 32 deg. 47 min. S. From the 15th of May to the 29th we had &s;ailed only 96 miles; but ob&s;erv|ing next day, we found by our latitude that we
<PB N="454" REF="534">
had a very &s;trong current, that had driven our &s;hip to the &s;outhward 34 miles farther than we judged our&s;elves to be; for we thought we had been in the latitude of 33 deg. 41 min. S. whereas we found our&s;elves in lat. 34 deg. 15 min. S. our cour&s;e having been S. W. 40 miles. I argued the rea&s;on with the chief mate of the &s;hip, and he told me it once happened in this place, that they lay a-trie with three main-&s;ails, and the wind at W. S. W. three days; and when they took their ob&s;ervation, they found the &s;hip dri|ven to windward 200 Engli&s;h miles; and like|wi&s;e in lat. 36 deg. 37 min. they &s;ay, they often find the like.</P>
<P>From hence to the 27th nothing remarkable happened; but on that day we had the wind very furious, blowing a &s;torm from W. S. W. We lay a-trie with our main-&s;ails, and found we were in lat. 30 deg. 2 min. S. coming in with the land; and now the current went to the ea&s;t|ward, and we began to fear le&s;t we &s;hould lo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age by the cape. Our Captain, who had long been &s;ick, was now judged to be pa&s;t reco|very, and in the middle of the night died: this occa&s;ioned a great deal of confu&s;ion; and, to add to our difficulties, our water began to fail, and we were reduced to a pint a day per man. Next day we heaved our Dutch Captain's corp&s;e over|board, when a council of-war was called, where|in it was re&s;olved, that Captain Tominall, Com|mander of the Crit&s;man, &s;hould command the Solida, and that Captain Tominall's chief-mate
<PB N="455" REF="535">
&s;hould command the Crit&s;man. The pilot al&s;o of the Solida, who&s;e name was Houdin, was or|dered on board the Crit&s;man; but he refu&s;ed to go, and the men a&s;&s;embled tumultuou&s;ly, and declared, they would not part with him. The Lord Van Heldine was in a great rage with the &s;teer&s;man; but the crew were re&s;olute, and he was obliged to yield.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of June we again came in &s;ight of land. It appeared like a round hill flat at top, and bore from us N. N. E. with a &s;maller hill to the ea&s;tward of it. Next day we were before the harbour of the cape, with the wind at north, and fine fair weather. On the 3d, at night, we came to an anchor in the bay before the ca&s;tle, in nine fathom water. Three days before we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Crit&s;man in the hard gale; but this day we &s;aw a &s;ail at &s;ea, and concluded that it mu&s;t be the Crit&s;man. Here we heard, that the Francis Maria was lo&s;t, with 400 men on board; and here likewi&s;e we were told, that the King of England had taken the Duke of Mon|mouth, and that he was beheaded. Another piece of news we learned was, that a Portugue&s;e carrac was ca&s;t away upon the reef, having on board four millions of guelders in gold, &s;ent as a pre|&s;ent from the King of Siam to the King of Por|tugal; and that four Dutch &s;hips had likewi&s;e &s;truck upon the &s;ame reef, but that they had fortunately e&s;caped with very little damage.</P>
<P>This day four of the natives came down to the city, dancing naked, and offering their wives
<PB N="456" REF="536">
to the Hollanders for little bits of tobacco. They were the filthie&s;t men I ever &s;aw. Next day my two friends and I walked about the town, in which are about 100 hou&s;es, built very low to &s;ave them from the boi&s;terous gales of wind that blow here in the months of December, January, and February: but the Dutch have here a &s;trong ca&s;tle, with 80 guns well mounted, and a &s;pa|cious garden with plea&s;ant walks, and planted with almo&s;t every kind of fruit, flowers, and herbs. This is the greate&s;t rarity that we &s;aw at the cape. We walked, moreover, without the town to the village inhabited by the Hodman|dods (&s;o called by the Hollanders), who are the natives of the country. The&s;e people are &s;aid to be born white, but make them&s;elves black by anointing their bodies, and expo&s;ing their infants to the &s;un and &s;moke. Their hou&s;es, or huts, are built round, like the cabbins in Ireland of the wild Iri&s;h, with the fire-place in the middle, round which they all lie in common, covered only with the &s;kins of &s;ome bea&s;t, and without any other bed than the a&s;hes of the wood on which they dre&s;s their meat. They eat any thing that is foul, and will gather from the dunghills the offal that is thrown out by the Dutch to feed their dogs. Their men are not at all jealous of foreigners; but will beat their wives unmerci|fully for lying with their neighbours. When the women marry, they cut off a joint of the middle-finger; and if the hu&s;band dies, and the widow marries again, &s;he cuts off another joint;
<PB N="457" REF="537">
and &s;o many men as they marry, &s;o many joints of their &s;ingers they lo&s;e. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to wor&s;hip the moon, becau&s;e at the full and change they a&s;&s;emble in great numbers, dancing and re|joicing when &s;he &s;hines, but howling and lament|ing when they are deprived of her light.</P>
<P>It happened while we were at the cape, that one of the Hodmandods drank him&s;elf dead at the fort; of which his countrymen getting intel|ligence, they a&s;&s;embled about him, and with oil and milk endeavoured to recover him; but, finding all their efforts vain, and that they could perceive no &s;park of life remaining, they began to make preparations for his funeral, which they performed in the following manner. They fir&s;t brought knives, and &s;haved him from head to foot; then, digging a hole in the ground, they carefully placed him in a &s;itting po&s;ture, with his body and head erect, and his legs and thighs &s;tretched out horizontally, and pre&s;&s;ed down &s;treight; this being performed, they propt him up in this attitude with &s;tones; and then came a company of their women to howl over him, who accompanied their lamentations with a hideous &s;hrieking, as if death appeared before them in the &s;hape of a mon&s;ter, and was ready to devour them. After their time of mourning was over, they filled up the hole with earth, and covered it over with the green turf.</P>
<P>During the time of our &s;tay at the cape, our people were chiefly employed in clean&s;ing and &s;couring the &s;hip, in fi&s;hing her ma&s;ts, and in
<PB N="458" REF="538">
fitting and trimming her rigging. We al&s;o took in wood and water, &s;upplied our&s;elves with fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and, on the 15th of June, when the wind came fair, we were ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>We were now three &s;hips in company, the Solida and Crit&s;man, who came together from Batavia, and the Emeland who came from Ben|gal. On Tue&s;day the 16th, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the N. W. and N. W. by W. till Tue&s;day the 29th, without any material incident intervening. We had no ob&s;ervation; but I judged we were in lat. 19 deg. 54 min. S. This day it was that I &s;poke with an Engli&s;hman on board the Emeland, that had been &s;ome time in the Dutch &s;ervice, who told me, that they came out in company with two Engli&s;h &s;hips, one named the Re&s;olution, the other the Defence, with both of whom they had parted in a &s;torm on the coa&s;t of Coromandel; that the Re&s;olu|tion was leaky, and that there were little hopes of her crew's being able to keep her above wa|ter. He told me likewi&s;e, that there were &s;eve|ral Engli&s;hmen in the King of Siam's &s;ervice; that the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company was but little regarded by the Moors; but that the in|terlopers were very much encouraged; and that one Mr. Deane, being their Chief, lived in great &s;plendor, never going out without 70 or 80 Moors to attend him.</P>
<P>We had, moreover, this day great fea&s;ting on board us, the Commanders of the other &s;hips being invited to an entertainment. But while
<PB N="459" REF="539">
the men were loading the guns to pay the u&s;ual &s;alute, they were alarmed by a &s;trange voice from the &s;ea, crying out, <HI>Come help, come help, a man over-board!</HI> on which they forthwith brought the &s;hip to, thinking to take him up; but they neither &s;aw, nor heard any more of him. Enquiry was then made through all the &s;hips, if any of them had lo&s;t a man; but upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination, it appeared that every &s;hip had her proper complement; &s;o that they concluded it was the &s;pirit of &s;ome man that had been drowned in that latitude by accident.</P>
<P>On the 11th of July another very wonderful incident very much a&s;toni&s;hed our company. When we left Batavia we took a &s;he-goat on board, which had then two young kids about three weeks old. This creature was ob&s;erved to grow bigger every day; and all that our people could conjecture was, that it proceeded from the unwhole&s;omne&s;s of the water that made her &s;well; but, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all of us, &s;he now brought forth four young ones, although no male had been on board.</P>
<P>On the 4th of July we threw one man over|board who died the night before, though no one knew of his being ill. He was an old Dane, who, having no body on board to take care of his effects, tho&s;e who fir&s;t perceived he was dead fell to rummaging his che&s;t, to &s;ecure to them|&s;elves what he had &s;aved; but, as in like ca&s;es, they could not agree about dividing the plunder, the matter came to the knowledge of the Cap|tain,
<PB N="460" REF="540">
who made the thieves give up all they had &s;tolen, which he took under his own care for the benefit of his family.</P>
<P>On the 12th of July we came up with the I&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion, and next day took a new departure from thence. On the 20th we found we were in lat. 15 deg. N. And now a council-of-war was called upon our Captain. His accu|&s;ation was, that he had formed a con&s;piracy with five men more, to murder a per&s;on of quality and his lady, with &s;ome other pa&s;&s;engers on board, and that, when the murders were accom|pli&s;hed, they were to &s;eize upon their riches, and run away with the &s;hip. The pur&s;er was the chief accu&s;er; but, upon examination, the whole charge &s;eemed &s;o improbable, and the man who broached the &s;tory denying upon the trial what he had confidently affirmed before to the pur&s;er, the Captain was honourably acquitted, and the villain puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 22d, we made out in longi|tude from the cape 11 deg. 56 min. judging our&s;elves to be in long. 355 deg. 56 min. And no wit was that I cut the &s;ame Line which I did when I departed from Virginia in the year 1683, having encompa&s;&s;ed the globe; and cannot but note, that I have been farther &s;outhward than any man that I ever heard or read of before me in this voyage, having, as I have already &s;aid, reached as far as lat. 60 deg. 30 min. S. and &s;o it happened, that, being bound to go north about Scotland to make Holland, I pa&s;&s;ed about 60
<PB N="461" REF="541">
deg. north, though I mention this as no extra|ordinary thing.</P>
<P>We met with no extraordinary occurrence till the 2d of Augu&s;t, when our Captain, after three days illne&s;s, died of a pain in his bowels. His chief &s;teer&s;man was made Commander in his room; but, though his cau&s;e was warmly e&s;pou&s;|ed by the men on a former occa&s;ion, yet it was not till after much oppo&s;ition that they acqui|e&s;ced in his pre&s;ent advancement.</P>
<P>On the 5th of September, about 10 at night, we had a violent &s;torm, and we had like to have been on board the Crit&s;man; and, by endeavouring to avoid it, had well nigh over&s;et our own &s;hip.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 19th, when the weather began to clear up, I &s;aw land, as did al&s;o two men more. I &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the i&s;land of Shetland; but our Captain would not believe it; however, about &s;ix in the evening, the Crit&s;man's people &s;aw land al&s;o, and let go the flag, which nettled our Captain, who blamed his own incredulity.</P>
<P>We came up with the I&s;le of Farley by the 22d, &s;teered on, and on the 25th had the wind all round the compa&s;s. About this time we came up with a Scotch &s;hip, who &s;teered &s;o that we ran her on board on her quarter; and, had we not &s;lackened &s;ail, &s;hould certainly have &s;unk her. Two pa&s;&s;engers leapt into our &s;hip to &s;ave their lives; but they happened to be more afraid than hurt. The &s;hip was called the Lion of Leith; and the crew told us, that the Turks lay at Ply|mouth
<PB N="462" REF="542">
and Dartmouth, where they had victual|led and careened, and from whence they had occa&s;ionally &s;lipt out, and had taken 100 &s;ail of Hollanders, and among them a Dutch frigate of 36 guns, which gave occa&s;ion to many hard &s;peeches again&s;t the Engli&s;h nation; though we found afterwards that the whole was an idle &s;tory, framed only to amu&s;e the Dutchmen, and to flatter their humour by belying the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>On &s;ailing next day with the wind at E. S. E. we found our&s;elves in latitude 53 deg. 35 min. N. and I judged us to be on the We&s;t-bank. At the &s;ame time we came up with two &s;hips, one a Dane, the other an Engli&s;hman from London, with whom I &s;ent my quadrant, and with whom my&s;elf and my two friends would willingly have gone, if our Dutch lord would have given us leave; but he told us, he could not an&s;wer the letting us go, to his Ma&s;ters the States-General.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 28th, we came before the Maes, with the wind at E. N. E. When it was day we &s;aw the Brill Church, and came to an anchor in 10 fathom water. On the 30th we got bread and beer on board. Next day we entered the harbour at Helvoet&s;luys, after we had been &s;even months in our pa&s;&s;age from Batavia. Three days after our arrival, one of my two mates died, and I made no great &s;tay here but went to Rotterdam, where I found the Anne yacht. In her I came pa&s;&s;enger for England, and, through the infinite mercy of God, arrived at London, October 12 following.</P>
<P><PB N="463" REF="543">Of Cowley's hi&s;tory, as we can know nothing but from this relation of his voyage, &s;o it is not ea&s;y either to form a judgment of his capacity, or of his acquirements. He &s;eems to have been an excellent navigator, as we do not find, in the whole cour&s;e of his pur&s;uits, either that he was ever at a lo&s;s in finding the ports he &s;ought, or that the &s;hips of which he had the direction were ever in danger of being ca&s;t away. The nature of his employment in a &s;ubordinate &s;ta|tion, led him rather to a habit of obedience than of oppo&s;ition; and therefore his quitting the &s;hip in which it was his choice to &s;ail, is more to be wondered at, than that he &s;hould &s;teal away from his company at Batavia with only two friends. Perhaps his conduct on this occa&s;ion might be owing to principle; for of the enormities committed by the buccaneers, with whom he was engaged, Cowley mu&s;t be acquitted, becau&s;e he was drawn into their &s;er|vice by &s;tratagem; and a &s;trong proof of his hone&s;ty is, his embracing the fir&s;t fair opportu|nity of de&s;erting them.</P>
<P>We know there are writers, and tho&s;e of no mean credit, who have taken pains to ju&s;tify the practices of the buccaneers, and who have attri|buted to their di&s;coveries and to their exploits the advancement of the art of navigation, and the emolument of their country: but it neither appears to us, that their di&s;coveries were of any con&s;equence in a national &s;en&s;e, or that the riches they brought home were a counter-balance
<PB N="464" REF="544">
for the lives that were &s;acrificed in the acqui|&s;ition.</P>
<P>Their di&s;coveries were chiefly of lurking-places to which they were forced to retire to e&s;cape the pur&s;uit of the enemy; and, as to the trea&s;ures they acquired, they were generally purcha&s;ed with the lives of many brave men, who, had they been employed in hone&s;t com|merce, would have gained profit to them&s;elves and honour to their country.</P>
<P>It is not from the temporary excur&s;ions of a banditti that a nation can hope to become rich; nor is it by a ha&s;ty race round the world that the art of navigation is to be improved. The improvements of art are &s;low in their progre&s;s; and the acqui&s;ition of national wealth can only be obtained by a &s;teady per&s;everance in indu&s;try and commerce. It is, therefore, the true intere&s;t of every commercial nation to di&s;countenance plunderers, and to applaud tho&s;e only who are employed in cultivating the arts of peace.</P>
