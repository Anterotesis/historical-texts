<P>AS it's an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Cu&s;tom in the&s;e latter Ages, for all Writers, particularly the Poetical, to &s;helter their Productions under the Protection of the mo&s;t Di&s;tingui&s;h'd, who&s;e Approbation pro|duces a kind of In&s;piration, much &s;uperior to that which the <HI>Heatheni&s;h</HI> Poets pretended to derive from their Fictitious <HI>Apollo:</HI> So it was my Ambition to Addre&s;s one of my weak Performances to Your Lord|&s;hip, who, by Univer&s;al Con&s;ent, are ju&s;tly allow'd to be the be&s;t Judge of all kinds of Writing.</P>
<P>I was indeed at fir&s;t deterr'd from my De&s;ign, by a Thought that it might be accounted unpardonable Rudene&s;s to obtrude a Trifle of this Nature to a Per&s;on, who&s;e &s;ublime Wi&s;dome moderates that Council, which at this Critical Juncture, over-rules the Fate of all <HI>Europe.</HI> But then I was encourag'd by Reflecting, that <HI>Lelius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> the two greate&s;t Men in their
<PB REF="3">
Time, among the <HI>Romans,</HI> both for Political and Military Virtues, in the height of their important Af|fairs, thought the Peru&s;al and Improving of <HI>Terence</HI>'s Comedies the noble&s;t way of unbinding their Minds. I own I were guilty of the highe&s;t Vanity, &s;hould I pre&s;ume to put my Compo&s;ures in Parallel with tho&s;e of that Celebrated <HI>Dramati&s;t;</HI> But then again, I hope that Your Lord&s;hip's native Goodne&s;s and Genero&s;i|ty, in Conde&s;cention to the Ta&s;te of the Be&s;t and Faire&s;t part of the Town, who have been pleas'd to be diverted by the following SCENES, will excu&s;e and overlook &s;uch Faults as your nicer Judgment might di&s;cern.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, the Occa&s;ion &s;eems fair for me to engage in a Panegyrick upon tho&s;e Natural and Acquired Abilities, which &s;o brightly Adorn your Per&s;on: But I &s;hall re&s;i&s;t that Temptation, being con&s;cious of the Inequality of a Female Pen to &s;o Ma&s;culine an Attempt; and having no other Ambition than to Sub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<L>The Poet mu&s;t have really been In&s;pir'd.</L>
<L>But the&s;e, alas! are Melancholy Days</L>

<L>Yet &s;ince Prophetick Lyes plea&s;e Fools o' Fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>And Women are &s;o fond of Agitation;</L>
<L>To Men of Sen&s;e I'll Prophe&s;y anew,</L>

<L><HI>Undaunted Colonels will to Camps repair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A&s;&s;ur'd, there'll be no Skirmi&s;hes this Year;</HI></L>
<L>On our own Terms will flow the wi&s;h'd-for Peace,</L>
<L>All Wars, except 'twixt Man and Wife, will cea&s;e.</L>
<L>The Grand Monarch may wi&s;h his Son a Throne,</L>
<L>But hardly will advance to lo&s;e his own.</L>
<L>This Sea&s;on mo&s;t things bear a &s;miling Face;</L>
<L>But Play'rs in Summer have a di&s;mal Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>Since your Appearance only is our Act of Grace.</L>
<L>Court Ladies will to Country Seats be gone,</L>
<L>My Lord can't all the Year live Great in Town;</L>
<L>Where wanting <HI>Opera's, Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> and a <HI>Play,</HI></L>
<L>They'll &s;igh, and &s;titch a Gown, to pa&s;s the time away.</L>
<L>Gay City-Wives at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> will appear,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Husbands long have labour'd for an Heir;</L>
<L>Where many a Courtier may their Wants relieve,</L>
<L>But by the Waters only they Conceive.</L>

<P>HA! Sir <HI>George Airy!</HI> A Birding thus early, what forbidden Game rouz'd you &s;o &s;oon? For no lawful Occa&s;ion cou'd invite a Per&s;on of your Figure abroad at &s;uch unfa&s;hionable Hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are &s;ome Men, <HI>Charles,</HI> whom Fortune has left free from Inquietudes, who are diligently &s;tudious to find out Ways and Means to make them&s;elves unea&s;ie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that any thing in Nature can ruffle the Temper of a Man, whom the four Sea&s;ons of the Year com|pliment with as many thou&s;and Pounds, nay! and a Father at Re&s;t with his Ance&s;tors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there 'tis now! a Man that wants Money thinks none can be unhappy that has it; but my Affairs are in &s;uch a whim&s;ical Po&s;ture, that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my Gold will relieve me or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, never con&s;ult the Stars about that; Gold has a Power beyond them; Gold unlocks the Midnight Coun|cils; Gold out-does the Wind, becalms the Ship, or fills her Sails; Gold is omnipotent below; it makes whole Armies fight, or fly; it buys even Souls, and bribes the Wretches to
<PB N="2" REF="9">
betray their Country: Then what can thy Bu&s;ine&s;s be, that Gold won't &s;erve thee in?</P>

<P>Ay, if thou'rt in Love with two hundred, Gold will fetch 'em, I warrant thee, Boy. But who are they? who are they? come.</P>

<P>One is a Lady who&s;e Face I never &s;aw, but witty as an Angel; the other beautiful as <HI>Venus&mdash;</HI></P>

<P>For ought I know, for I never &s;poke to her, but you can inform me; I am charm'd by the Wit of One, and dye for the Beauty of the Other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, which are you in Que&s;t of now?</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, then I pity you; for the Jew my Father will no more part with her, and 30000 Pound, than he wou'd with a Guinea to keep me from &s;tarving.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you &s;ee Gold can't do every thing, <HI>Charles.</HI></P>

<P>Yes, for 'tis her Gold that bars my Father's Gate a|gain&s;t you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if he is this avaricious Wretch, how cam'&s;t thou by &s;uch a liberal Education?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a Sou&s;e out of his Pocket, I a&s;&s;ure you? I had an Uncle who defray'd that Charge, but for &s;ome little Wild|ne&s;&s;es of Youth, tho' he made me his Heir, left Dad my Guar|dian till I came to Years of Di&s;cretion, which I pre&s;ume the old Gentleman will never think I am; and now he has got the E&s;tate into his Clutches, it does me no more good, than if it lay in <HI>Pre&s;ter John</HI>'s Dominions.</P>

<P>I am always ready, but what do's he intend to do with <HI>Miranda?</HI> Is &s;he to be &s;old in private? or will he put her up by way of Auction, at who bids mo&s;t? If &s;o, Egad, I'm for him; my Gold, as you &s;ay, &s;hall be &s;ub&s;ervient to my Plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal ingenuou&s;ly with you, Sir <HI>George,</HI> I know very little of Her, or Home; for &s;ince my Uncle's Death, and my Return from Travel, I have never been well with my Father; he thinks my Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never &s;ees me, but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I &s;hun his Hou&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>Can &s;he con&s;ent to it?</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes faith, &s;o they &s;ay; but I tell you, I am wholly ignorant of the matter. <HI>Miranda</HI> and I are like two violent Members of a contrary Party; I can &s;carce allow her Beauty, tho' all the World do's; nor &s;he me Civility, for that Con|tempt: I fancy &s;he plays the Mother-in-law already, and &s;ets the old Gentleman on to do mi&s;chief.</P>
