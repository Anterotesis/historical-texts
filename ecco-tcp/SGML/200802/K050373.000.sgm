<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO prepare MASSINGER'S Tragi-Comedy, THE PICTURE, for a modern entertainment, proved a more arduous ta&s;k than was at fir&s;t conceived. After giving a different turn to the drama, by making the changes of the Picture, the effects of <HI>Eugenius</HI>'s jealou&s;y, in&s;tead of the magic art of <HI>Bapti&s;ta,</HI> and expunging the gro&s;s indelicacies which overran the play, it was found that mo&s;t of the cha|racters required a little fre&s;h modelling to complete the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent undertaking. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of new-writing no incon&s;iderable part of the dialogue, in imitation of the old Dramati&s;t. Though enamoured with the beauties of the antique &s;tructure, the Alterer &s;et about its reparation with the utmo&s;t di&s;&s;idence, fearing, like an un&s;kilful ar|chitect, he might de&s;troy tho&s;e venerable features he could not improve! What has been his &s;ucce&s;s, the public deci&s;ion mu&s;t determine.</P>
<P>The &s;ame kind of irregular and broken mea&s;ure, through nece&s;&s;ity &s;till prevails, except where the language could be reduced to the heroic ver&s;e without impairing the &s;pirit of the dialogue.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
As to the <HI>unities,</HI>&mdash;being &s;o totally di&s;regarded by MASSINGER him&s;elf, no u&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly be made of them in the pre&s;ent alteration.</P>
<P>The performance of the MAGIC PICTURE was every thing that an Author could expect, or wi&s;h for. The friend&s;hip and liberality of Mr. HARRIS were zealou&s;ly exerted on the occa&s;ion. Mr. SHIELD aided it with his harmonic powers; and every performer, by a well &s;u&s;tained character, united in it's &s;upport: but Mi&s;s YOUNGE'S SOPHIA was too &s;triking a re|pre&s;entation not to demand a particular acknow|ledgment.&mdash;To this fortunate combination of talents, THE MAGIC PICTURE chiefly &s;tands indebted for the very flattering reception with which it has been honored!</P>
