<P>WHILST the ta&s;te, genius, and knowledge of the an|cients, have been univer&s;ally felt and acknowledged in every other part of polite literature, it is mat|ter of admiration to con&s;ider, that the Greek Theatre &s;hould &s;o long have remain'd in neglect and ob&s;curity. In philo&s;ophy, morals, oratory, and heroic poetry, in every art and &s;cience, we look back to Greece, as the &s;tandard and model of perfection: the ruins of Athens afford, even to this day, fre&s;h plea&s;ure and delight; and, nothing but her &s;tage &s;eems to be forgotten by us. Homer, Xenophon, Demo&s;thenes, and many other eminent Greek writers, have of late years put on an Engli&s;h habit, and gain'd admi&s;&s;ion even into what is call'd polite company; whil&s;t Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, &s;till lurk in &s;chools and colleges; and very &s;eldom make their appearance, at lea&s;t with dirty leaves, in the libraries of the great. To what &s;hall we attribute a judgment &s;o capricious and &s;o unaccountable? partly, perhaps, to the ha&s;ty &s;everity of ignorant foes, and partly, to the outrageous zeal of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remarks, which are handed down to us on Antient Tragedy, have hitherto, for the mo&s;t part, con&s;i&s;ted of mere verbal critici&s;ms, various read|ings, or general and trite exclamations of undi&s;tingui&s;hing applau&s;e, made by dull and phlegmatic commentators, totally void of ta&s;te and judgment; add to this, that the old tragedians have been &s;hamefully di&s;gui&s;ed and mi&s;repre|&s;ented to the unlearned, by the fal&s;e medium of bad tran&s;lations.</NOTE> mi&s;taken friend&s;hip. The fate of Antient Tragedy hath, indeed, been &s;ingularly unfortunate: &s;ome paint|ers have drawn a too flattering likene&s;s of her; whil&s;t others, have pre&s;ented us with nothing but a caricature; &s;ome exalt the Greek drama, as the mo&s;t perfect of all human compo&s;itions, without the lea&s;t &s;pot or blemi&s;h; whil&s;t others affect to call it the infant &s;tate of the &s;tage, weak, infirm and imperfect; and
<PB N="4" REF="3">
as &s;uch, treat it with the highe&s;t degree of negligence and con|tempt: exaggerated thus on the one hand by the extravagant encomiums of injudicious learning, and deba&s;ed on the other by the ra&s;h cen&s;ures of modern petulance, it's real and intrin&s;ic me|rit hath never been thoroughly known, or candidly enquired into: the be&s;t method however in this, as in every other di&s;puted point, is to &s;et a&s;ide all prejudice and authority, and deter|mine the cau&s;e by our own rea&s;on and judgment, from a fair, full, and impartial view of it.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;pectator may be able to form a proper and com|plete idea of any object pre&s;ented to him, it is nece&s;&s;ary to place him in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as that his eye may at once compre|hend the whole, and every part of it: for this purpo&s;e, I have collected and ranged in order a few materials, which, in the hands of &s;ome abler writer, may po&s;&s;ibly lay the foundation for a complete hi&s;tory of the Antient Drama; in the mean time, the following &s;heets confine them&s;elves to, and pretend to no more than, a brief account of the origin and progre&s;s of the Greek Tragedy; it's end and purport, the &s;everal parts, proper|ties, and conduct of it; the con&s;truction, &s;cenery, and decora|tions of the theatre; to which is added, a tran&s;ient, but nece&s;&s;ary view of the genius, character and &s;ituation, religion, morals and politics of the people, before whom it was repre&s;ented; toge|ther with a &s;hort &s;ketch of the lives and characters of the three great tragedians.</P>

<HEAD>On the Origin of TRAGEDY.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more agreeable to the inqui&s;itive mind, than to trace the gradual improvement of any art or &s;cience; to mark the cau&s;es of it's growth and culture, and pursue it through it's various &s;tages of perfection: it is much to be lamented therefore, that neither Ari&s;totle, nor any other writer on Antient Tragedy, hath given us an exact or regular ac|count of it's progre&s;s and advancement from the time of it's birth to that of it's maturity and &s;plendor; the few &s;catter'd anecdotes, which remain concerning it, rather &s;erving to awaken our curio&s;ity than to afford us any full and &s;atisfactory inform|ation.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY was, in it's infancy, like every other production of human art, extremely weak, low, and contemptible: that wide and deep &s;tream, which flows with &s;uch &s;trength and rapidity through cultivated Greece, took it's ri&s;e from a &s;mall and incon|&s;iderable fountain, which hides it&s;elf in the rece&s;&s;es of antiquity, and is almo&s;t buried in oblivion: the name alone remains to give us &s;ome light into it's original nature, and to inform us that Tragedy, like every other &s;pecies of poetry, owed it's birth to religion.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, or the <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign">, a goat, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, a &s;ong. The commentators, not content with this mo&s;t natural and obvious interpretation, have given us &s;everal others. Some of them turn <GAP DESC="foreign"> into <GAP DESC="foreign">, and &s;o derive it from <GAP DESC="foreign">, the lees of wine, with which we are told the actors &s;mear'd their faces: others inform us, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies, new wine, a &s;kin of which was, it &s;eems, u&s;ually given to the poet (like the butt of &s;ack to our laureats) as a reward for his labours: but I &s;hall not trouble my reader with the enumeration of their whim&s;ical conjectures.</NOTE> &s;ong of the goat, was only a &s;acred hymn. Bacchus, we are told, the fir&s;t cultivator of vines, imparted his
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;ecret to a petty prince in Attica, named Icarius, who, happen|ing one day to e&s;py a goat, browzing on his plantations, imme|diately &s;eized and offer'd him up as a &s;acrifice to his divine bene|factor: the pea&s;ants a&s;&s;embled round their ma&s;ter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ceremony, and expre&s;s'd their joy and gratitude, in &s;ongs and dances on the occa&s;ion; the <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is told by Brumoy, and by twenty others, with little variation. It &s;eems, notwith&s;tanding, to carry with it the air of a fiction, &s;o far as it re|gards Icarius, who &s;eems only to have been introduced becau&s;e Icaria was famous for vines, and (as Spon tells us in his voyage to Italy) was the fir&s;t place where they &s;acrificed a goat to Bacchus, and al&s;o, where tragedies and comedies were fir&s;t exhibited; but &s;urely the &s;ong of the goat might be ac|counted for, without application to any particular per&s;on. Bacchus, being, the acknowledged inventor and cultivator of the vine, it was mo&s;t natural that the fir&s;t planters &s;hould &s;acrifice to him the de&s;troyers of it; the goat being a crea|ture as remarkably fond of the leaves of the vine, as his &s;acrificer was of the juice of the grape; we &s;hall find that he fell a victim not to Bacchus alone; and that the poet, as well as the god, came in for a &s;hare of him.</NOTE> &s;acrifice grew into a fe&s;tival, and the fe&s;tival into an annual &s;olemnity, attended mo&s;t probably every year with additional circum&s;tances, when the countrymen flock'd together in crowds, and &s;ung in ru&s;tic &s;trains the prai&s;es of their favourite deity. The rural &s;acrifice became, in proce&s;s of time, a &s;olemn fea&s;t, and a&s;&s;umed all the pomp and &s;plendor of a religious ceremony; poets were employed by the magi&s;|trate to compo&s;e hymns or &s;ongs for the occa&s;ion: &s;uch was the rudene&s;s and &s;implicity of the age, that their bards con|tended for a prize, which, as <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Vilem certavit ob hircum. <BIBL>Art. Poet.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Horace intimates, was &s;carce
<PB N="7" REF="6">
worth contending for; being no more than a goat or &s;kin of wine, which was given to the happy poet, who acquitted him|&s;elf be&s;t in the ta&s;k a&s;&s;ign'd to him.</P>
<P>THIS was probably the period, when The&s;pis fir&s;t pointed out the tragic path, by his introduction of a new per&s;onage, who relieved the Chorus or troop of &s;ingers, by reciting part of &s;ome well-known hi&s;tory or fable, which gave time for the Chorus to re&s;t. All, that the actor <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">When Tragedy a&s;&s;umed a regular form, the&s;e recitations which, during it's imperfect &s;tate, were only adventitious ornaments, became the principal and con&s;tituent parts of the drama, the &s;ubject of them, drawn from one and the &s;ame action, retaining their fir&s;t name of epi&s;ode.</NOTE> repeated between the &s;ongs of the Chorus, was call'd an epi&s;ode or additional part; con&s;i&s;ting often of different adventures, which had no connection with each other. Thus the Chorus, or &s;ong, which was at fir&s;t the only, and afterwards the principal performance, became gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly but an incon&s;iderable, though, as we &s;hall &s;ee here|after, a nece&s;&s;ary and ornamental part of the drama.</P>
<P>FROM this time, we may imagine, the actor or reciter was more attended to than the Chorus; however his part was executed, it had the powerful charms of novelty to recommend it, and quickly ob&s;cured the lu&s;tre of the Chorus, who&s;e &s;ongs were now of a different nature, in&s;omuch, that the original &s;ubject of them, the prai&s;e of Bacchus, was by degrees either &s;lightly mention'd, or totally pa&s;s'd over and forgotten: the prie&s;ts, who, we may &s;uppo&s;e, for a long time pre&s;ided over the whole, were alarm'd at &s;o open a contempt of the deity, and unanimou&s;ly exclaim'd, that all this <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> was nothing to Bacchus; the complaint grew into a kind of proverbial &s;aying, and as &s;uch is handed down to us.</P>
<P>FROM the origin of Tragedy, to the days of The&s;pis, and from his time to that of Ae&s;chylus, all is doubt, conjecture and ob|&s;curity;
<PB N="8" REF="7">
neither Ari&s;totle, nor any other antient writer, give us the lea&s;t in&s;ight into the &s;tate and progre&s;s of the Greek drama: if his treati&s;e call'd <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This treati&s;e contain'd an exact account of the names, times, and authors of all the plays that were ever acted.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign"> had reach'd po&s;terity, it would probably have afforded us much plea&s;ure and in&s;truction: the names of a few, and but a few tragedians, during this dark pe|riod, are handed down to us: &s;uch were <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The Bacchae, a tragedy of his, is cited by Athenaeus.</NOTE> Epigenes, the Sicyo|nian, and Pratinas, who wrote fifty plays, thirty-two of which are &s;aid to have been &s;atyrical: after The&s;pis, came his &s;cholar Phrynicus, who wrote nine tragedies, for <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Strabo, Herodotus and Plutarch.</NOTE> one of which we are told he was fined fifty drachmas, becau&s;e he had made it (an odd rea&s;on) too deep, and too affecting: there was al&s;o ano|ther Phrynicus, author of <NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Call'd, Andromeda and Erigone.</NOTE> two tragedies; to the&s;e we mu&s;t add <NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mention'd by Macrobius and Pollux.</NOTE> Alcaeus, Phormus, and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Choerilus is &s;aid to have written no le&s;s than a hundred and twenty tragedies.</NOTE> Choerilus; together with Cephi&s;odorus, an Athenian, who wrote the Amazons, and Apol|lophanes, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the author of a tragedy, named Daulis; though Suidas is of another opinion.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, during the lives of the&s;e writers, had in all proba|bility made but a &s;low progre&s;s, and received very little culture or improvement, when at length the great Ae&s;chylus aro&s;e, who from this rude and undige&s;ted chaos, created as it were a new world in the &s;y&s;tem of letters. Poets, and even epic poets there might perhaps have been before Homer; dramatic writers there certainly were before Ae&s;chylus, the former notwith&s;tanding we may with the utmo&s;t propriety &s;tile the inventor and father of

heroic poetry, and the latter of the antient drama, which before his time doth not appear to have had any form, &s;hape or beauty. He fir&s;t introduced dialogue, that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of tragedy, by the addition of a &s;econd per&s;onage, threw the whole fable into action, and re&s;tored the chorus to it's antient dignity.</P>
<P>AESCHYLUS, having like a tender parent endow'd his darling child with every mental accompli&s;hment, &s;eem'd re&s;olved that no external ornaments &s;hould be wanting to render her univer|&s;ally amiable: he cloathed her therefore in the mo&s;t &s;plendid ha|bit, and be&s;tow'd on her every thing that art could procure to heighthen and improve her charms. We know, from good autho|rity, that fifty years before his time The&s;pis exhibited his rude performances in a cart, and be&s;mear'd the faces of his actors with the lees of wine, probably to di&s;gui&s;e their per&s;ons and give them the appearance of tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ented; but Ae&s;chylus, who as being him&s;elf author, actor, and manager, took upon him the whole conduct of the drama, did not neglect any part of it; he improved the &s;cenery and decorations, brought his actors into a regular and well-con&s;tructed theatre, rai&s;ed his he|roes on the cothurnus or bu&s;kin, invented the ma&s;ques, and in|troduced &s;plendid <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash; per&s;onae, pallaeque repertor hone&s;tae</L><L>Ae&s;chylus, &amp; modicis in&s;travit pulpita tignis,</L><L>Et docuit magnumque loqui, nitique cothurno.</L><BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> habits with long trains that gave an air of maje&s;ty and dignity to the performers.</P>
<P>FROM the time when tragedy began to a&s;&s;ume a regular form, we find her clo&s;ely following the &s;teps of epic poetry; all the parts of the epop&eacute;e, or heroic poem, may be traced in tragedy, though, as Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves, all the parts of tragedy are not to be found in the epop&eacute;e; whence the parti&s;ans of the &s;tage with

&s;ome rea&s;on conclude, that perfection in the former is more diffi|cult to be attain'd than in the latter. Without entring into this di&s;pute, we may venture however to &s;tile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Homer, &s;ays Ari&s;totle, was the fir&s;t, who <GAP DESC="foreign">, 'invented dramatic imitations.'</Q> <Q>There was no more left for tragedy (&s;ays Lord Shaft&s;bury) than to erect a &s;tage, and draw his dialogues and charac|ters into &s;cenes, turning in the &s;ame manner upon one principal action or event, with regard to place and time; which was &s;uitable to a real &s;pectacle. <BIBL>See Characteri&s;t. vol.

<P>FROM this aera then, we are to con&s;ider tragedy as an elegant and noble &s;tructure, built according to the rules of art, &s;ymmetry and proportion; who&s;e every part was in it&s;elf fair, firm and compact, and at the &s;ame time contributed to the beauty, u&s;e|fulne&s;s and duration of the whole edifice. Sophocles and Euri|pides carefully &s;tudied the plan laid down by Ae&s;chylus, and by their &s;uperior genius and judgment improved it in a &s;hort time to it's highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection, from which it gradually declined to the introduction of the Roman drama.</P>

<HEAD>On the parts of Antient Tragedy.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST many other erroneous opinions concerning the Greek tragedy, adopted by modern editors and commenta|tors, the unwarrantable divi&s;ion, which they have made of it into <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See a di&s;&s;ertation on this &s;ubject, by Mon&s;. Vatry, in the hi&s;t. de l'acad. vol. 8, p. 188.</NOTE> acts, is perhaps the mo&s;t remarkable, as there doth not &s;eem to be the lea&s;t ground or foundation for it: in the fir&s;t place, neither Athenaeus, nor any of the antient writers, who have given us quo|tations from the Greek plays, mention the act where the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages are to be found; which they would mo&s;t naturally have done, had any &s;uch divi&s;ion ever taken place. It may be like|wi&s;e ob&s;erved, that the word <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which we tran&s;late an act, &s;ignifies the whole per|formance, or drama, and could not po&s;&s;ibly therefore mean any one particular part of it.</NOTE> Act does not once occur in that treati&s;e of Ari&s;totle, which gives us &s;o exact a definition of every part of the Greek drama; add to this, that the tragedies them|&s;elves carry with them &s;ufficient proof that no &s;uch thing was ever thought on by the authors of them; notwith&s;tanding which, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chorus, &s;ays Vo&s;&s;ius, pars fabulae po&s;t actum, vel inter actum &amp; actum. See in&s;t. poet. l. 2.</NOTE> Vo&s;&s;ius, Barnes, and &s;everal other editors have di&s;cover'd an office of the chorus, which the poet never a&s;&s;ign'd them, namely, their u&s;e in dividing the acts, the intervals of which were &s;up|plied
<PB N="12" REF="11">
by their &s;ongs; though it is evident that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the chorus (as will &s;ufficiently appear in the following account of it) was, on the other hand, to prevent any &s;uch unnatural pau&s;e or vacancy in the drama, as the divi&s;ion into acts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce; be&s;ides that, if we take the word act in that &s;en&s;e, which the modern u&s;e of it demands, we &s;hall find it in the Greek tragedies compo&s;ed &s;ometimes of a &s;ingle &s;cene, and &s;ometimes of half a dozen; and <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">On looking into the choru&s;&s;es of Sophocles as they &s;tand in the original, we find that the Ajax, be&s;ides the <GAP DESC="foreign"> (which will be explain'd hereafter) has five, which are thus unequally divided; to the fir&s;t act two; the &s;econd one; the third one; the fourth one; the fifth none at all: the Trachiniae has &s;ix; the Electra but three; and the Philoctetes but one regular &s;ong or intermede in the whole play. If it be granted therefore, as I think it is on all hands, that wherever we meet with &s;trophe and anti&s;trophe, and there only we are to conceive that the chorus &s;ung, nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to make tho&s;e &s;ongs dividers of the acts, when it is evident that the chorus &s;ung only as occa&s;ion offer'd, and the circum&s;tances of the drama required, which ac|counts for the irregularity and difference in the numbers of them. If the reader will take the trouble to examine the antient tragedies, he will find what I have &s;aid confirm'd in every one of them.</NOTE> if the &s;ongs or intermedes of the chorus are to determine the number of acts, the play will con&s;i&s;t not always of five, according to our own cu&s;tom, but at one time of only three, and at another of &s;even or eight. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Neve minor, neu &s;it quinto productior actu.</NOTE> Ho|race has indeed told us, that there &s;hould be but five acts; but it does not from thence follow that it always was &s;o: the truth after all is, that this mi&s;take, as well as many others, aro&s;e from an error common to almo&s;t the whole race of writers and critics on antient tragedy, who have unanimou&s;ly agreed to confound the Greek and Roman drama, concluding them both to be go|vern'd by the &s;ame laws, though they are in many parts e&s;&s;enti|ally different: they never allow for the time between Ari&s;totle and Horace, but leap from one to the other with the utmo&s;t

agility: it is plain however, from <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Many other rea&s;ons equally forcible might be alledged, &s;ome of which the reader will find &s;catter'd about in the notes to my Tran&s;lation of Sophocles. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that the old editions of the Greek tragedies, &s;o far from dividing them into acts, do not &s;o much as make the lea&s;t &s;eparation of the &s;cenes; even the names of the per&s;ons are not always properly affix'd to the &s;peeches; no notice is taken of the entrances and exits of the actors; the a&s;ides are never mark'd, nor any of the ge&s;tures or actions, which frequently occur, pointed out to us in the margin; defects which, however incon&s;iderable, may mi&s;lead the young and injudicious reader, and which ought therefore to be carefully &s;upplied by the critic or tran&s;lator.</NOTE> the rea&s;ons here mention'd, that the antient Greek tragedy was one continued repre&s;entation from beginning to end.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion into acts therefore is undoubtedly a piece of mo|dern refinement; which, as much may be &s;aid on both &s;ides, I &s;hall not &s;top either to condemn or approve, but proceed to the only divi&s;ion, which the antients ever made; a divi&s;ion, which nature points out to this and every other compo&s;ition, viz. a <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q>The cau&s;e and de&s;ign of undertaking any action are the beginning; the effects of tho&s;e cau&s;es and the difficulties we find in the execution of that de|&s;ign are the middle; the unravelling and re&s;olving tho&s;e difficulties are the end. <BIBL>See Bo&s;&s;u's treati&s;e on epic poetry.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> begin|ning, a middle, and an end; or, in the words of Ari&s;totle, the prologue, the epi&s;ode, and the exode.</P>
<P>THE PROLOGUE of antient tragedy, was not unlike the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or overture in mu&s;ic, or the prooemium in oratory, containing all that part of the drama, which <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle mu&s;t certainly be under&s;tood to mean not the fir&s;t entrance, but the fir&s;t &s;ong or intermede of the chorus; becau&s;e, as Dacier and other wri|ters have ob&s;erved, there are tragedies (as the Per&s;ae and Suppliants of Ae&s;chy|lus) where the chorus enters fir&s;t on the &s;tage and opens the play; to &s;uch therefore, if Ari&s;totle meant the &s;peaking and not the &s;ong, there would be no prologue; a contradiction, which is avoided by under&s;tanding what is here &s;aid of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or fir&s;t &s;ong, which never begins till the prologue is over, and matter furni&s;h'd to the chorus for the intermede.</NOTE> preceded the fir&s;t &s;ong, or intermede of the chorus.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">WHAT Ari&s;totle calls the prologue &s;hould contain, according to the antient critics, all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which are nece&s;&s;ary to be known for the better under&s;tanding and comprehen&s;ion of the whole drama, as, the place of the &s;cene, the time when the action commences, the names and characters of the per&s;ons concern'd, together with &s;uch an in&s;ight into the plot as might awaken the curio&s;ity of the &s;pectator without letting him too far into the de&s;ign and conduct of it. This, however ea&s;y it may &s;eem at fir&s;t view, is &s;o difficult, that it has &s;carce ever been per|form'd to any degree of perfection.

The chorus, as I before ob&s;erved, gave the fir&s;t hint to the formation of tragedy, and was as it were the corner-&s;tone of the whole edifice: as a religious cere|mony it was con&s;ider'd by the multitude with a kind of &s;uper&s;ti|tious veneration; it is not therefore improbable that the fir&s;t au|thors of the regular drama willingly gave way to popular preju|dices, and for this, among many other rea&s;ons, incorporated it into the body of the tragedy: accordingly, we find the chorus of Ae&s;chylus re&s;uming it's original office, reciting the prai&s;es of the local deities, demi-gods and heroes, taking the part of di&s;tre&s;s'd virtue, and abounding throughout in all tho&s;e moral precepts, and religious &s;entiments, by which the writings of the antients are &s;o eminently and &s;o honourably di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>VARIOUS are the arguments that have from time to time been produced by the zealous partizans of antiquity, in favour of the tragic chorus, the principal of which I &s;hall briefly recapitulate and lay before my readers, begging leave at the &s;ame time to premi&s;e, that whether a chorus is defen&s;ible with regard to the antient theatre, and whether it &s;hould be adopted by the mo|dern, are two very different que&s;tions, though generally blended
<PB N="17" REF="16">
and confu&s;ed by writers on this &s;ubject; the former may perhaps be ea&s;ily proved, though the latter be left totally undetermined.

<HEAD>On the Con&s;truction of the Greek Theatre.</HEAD>
<P>THE GREEK THEATRE is among&s;t tho&s;e &s;uperb monuments of antient ta&s;te, genius and magnificence, which would probably have &s;urvived the depredations, even of time it&s;elf, if ignorance and barbari&s;m had not con&s;pired to ruin and de&s;troy it: of all tho&s;e noble and co&s;tly &s;tructures which Athens, and Sparta dedicated to the mu&s;es, we have now &s;carce any thing but a few incon&s;iderable remains, &s;ufficiently &s;triking to rai&s;e our cu|rio&s;ity, but at the &s;ame time too mutilated and imperfect to &s;a|tisfy it. Tho&s;e writers of antiquity, who have occa&s;ionally men|tion'd the con&s;truction of the theatre, as they treated a &s;ubject univer&s;ally known by their cotemporaries, did not think them&s;elves obliged to handle it with that degree of accuracy and preci&s;ion, which were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the information of po&s;terity; in con|&s;equence of which, they frequently gave names to one part of the building that more properly belong'd to another, and by a con|fu&s;ion of terms, which could not mi&s;lead the readers of their own times, involved their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in a labyrinth of error and ob&s;cu|rity; add to this, that the &s;ame fate hath attended the de&s;cription of the building, which had before happen'd to the &s;everal con&s;ti|tuent parts of the drama; modern critics too often confound to|gether the Greek and Roman theatre (though they differ mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in many parts) we find terms frequently appropriated to one, which belong only to the other; and the whole &s;o im|perfectly delineated, by almo&s;t every one of them, as to render it throughout a matter of doubt and uncertainty. Some lights how|ever have from time to time been thrown on this dark and intri|cate &s;ubject, who&s;e &s;catter'd rays, when united and drawn to a point, will exhibit to us the following tolerably accurate, though &s;till imperfect repre&s;entation of it.</P>

To determine the &s;ituation of the&s;e three parts, and con&s;equently the di&s;po&s;ition of the whole, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the plan (here annex'd) con&s;i&s;ts on one &s;ide of two &s;emi-circles, drawn from the &s;ame centre, but of different diameters; and on the other, of a &s;quare of the &s;ame length, but le&s;s by one half; the &s;pace between the two &s;emi|circles, was allotted for the &s;pectators; the &s;quare at the end, to the actors; and the intervening area in the middle, to the orche&s;tra.

<P>IT appears from the united te&s;timonies of &s;everal antient wri|ters, that the actors of Greece never appear'd on the &s;tage in tragedy, or any other &s;pecies of the drama without ma&s;ques: it is mo&s;t probable, that before the time of Ae&s;chylus, to whom <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Suidas and Athenaeus attribute the invention of ma&s;ques to the poet Choe|rilus.

<HEAD>Of the time when Tragedy flouri&s;h'd in Greece.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not my de&s;ign in this &s;hort Di&s;&s;ertation (nor could in|deed be comprehended within the limits of it) to point out with Ari&s;totle what tragedy ought to be, but &s;imply to &s;hew what it was during the lives of the great triumvirate, as far as we can judge from the remains now extant; in my account of it's &s;everal parts therefore I have not follow'd the &s;teps of the great critic, but principally confined my&s;elf to tho&s;e particulars, which di&s;tingui&s;h the antient from the modern drama, and which may be&s;t enable us to form a proper and adequate idea of the Greek tragedy; but even the mo&s;t perfect knowledge of all the e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tituent parts will be found in&s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, unle&s;s we take into our view al&s;o the time when, and the very &s;pot where every piece was exhibited. Dramatic, as well as every other &s;pecies of poetry, is be&s;t known and di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by the place of it's birth; it will take it's form, colour, and complection from it's native &s;oil, as naturally as water de|rives it's ta&s;te and qualities from the different kinds of earth, through which it flows: it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, before we can judge impartially of the Greek tragedies, to tran&s;port our&s;elves to the &s;cene where they were repre&s;ented, to &s;hake off the Engli&s;h|man for a time, and put on the Athenian.</P>
<P>IT has been with great truth remark'd, that there is allotted to every nation upon earth a particular period, which may be call'd their zenith of perfection, to which they approach by &s;low degrees, and from which, they gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly recede: in this happy age of power and pro&s;perity, the arts and &s;ciences,
<PB N="44" REF="44">
ta&s;te, genius, and literature have always &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;h'd lu&s;tre: &s;uch was the time when Athens gave laws to all Greece, whil&s;t the glorious victories of Marathon and Salamis animated every tongue with eloquence, and fill'd every brea&s;t with exulta|tion; that haughty and &s;ucce&s;sful people maintain'd for a long time her &s;overeignty over the neighbouring nations; her councils were influenced by prudence, and her battles crown'd with con|que&s;t; the trea&s;ure, which &s;he had &s;eized in the temple at Del|phos, enabled her not only to carry on her wars with &s;ucce&s;s, but left her a plentiful re&s;erve al&s;o to &s;upply her luxuries: this was the age of heroes, philo&s;ophers and poets; when architec|ture, painting, and &s;culpture, fo&s;ter'd by the genial warmth of power and protection, &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly di&s;play'd their &s;everal beau|ties, and produced all tho&s;e &s;uperb monuments of antient ta&s;te and genius, which united to di&s;tingui&s;h this illu&s;trious aera: du|ring this happy period, tragedy appear'd in her meridian &s;plen|dor, when the great triumvirate exhibited before the mo&s;t polite and refined nation then upon earth tho&s;e excellent pieces, which extorted applau&s;e, honours and rewards, from their cotemporaries, and en&s;ured to them the de&s;erved admiration of all po&s;terity: it may indeed with great truth be a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;ame remark|able love of order and &s;implicity, the &s;ame ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;ymmetry and proportion, the &s;ame elegance, truth and &s;ublimity, which appear'd in the buildings, pictures and &s;tatues of that age, are con&s;picuous al&s;o in the antient drama.</P>
<P>IN the time of the Greek tragedy, the Athenians dictated as it were to all mankind: proud by nature, and elated by riches and pro&s;perity, they look'd down with the utmo&s;t contempt on the neighbouring nations, whom they &s;tiled and treated as barbarians; as a republic, the avow'd enemies of monarchy and dependence; as a free people, bold and impatient of re&s;traint or contradiction; &s;trongly attach'd to their own laws and cu&s;toms; lively and act|ive,

but incon&s;tant and &s;uper&s;titious; their manners plain and &s;imple, but their ta&s;te at the &s;ame time elegant and refined. As the theatre was &s;upported entirely at the expence of the public, the public directed all it's operations; we might naturally expect therefore, that the poet would for his own &s;ake take care to adapt his compo&s;itions to the public ta&s;te; to fall in with national pre|judices and &s;uper&s;titions; to &s;ooth the pride, flatter the &s;elf-love, and adopt the opinions of his fellow-citizens: we mu&s;t not won|der to hear, as we con&s;tantly do, (in the tragedies that remain) the prai&s;es of Athens perpetually re&s;ounded, the &s;uperiority of her laws and con&s;titution extoll'd, and her form of government pre|fer'd to every other; oblique hints, or direct accu&s;ations of folly and weakne&s;s in her enemies; public facts frequently alluded to, and public events recorded; their own fe&s;tivals, &s;acrifices, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See, among&s;t many other in&s;tances, the noble de&s;cription of the Pythian games, in the &s;econd act of Electra, v. 1, p. 137, of my tran&s;lation of Sophocles, and the &s;acred grove of the Eumenides, in the Oedipus Coloneus, v. 2, p. 292.</NOTE> reli|gious rites, and ceremonies, carefully and accurately de&s;cribed; Sparta and Thebes, as rival &s;tates, occa&s;ionally &s;atyrized and con|demn'd; and above all, every opportunity taken to point out the evils of monarchy, and engrave their favourite democratical principles on the hearts of the people: it is not improbable but that many of tho&s;e moral &s;entences, and political apothegms, which at this di&s;tance of time appear cold and in&s;ipid to us, had, be&s;ides their general tendency, &s;ome double meaning, &s;ome allu|&s;ion to particular facts and circum&s;tances, which gave them an additional lu&s;tre: without this key to the Greek theatre, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form a right idea of antient tragedy, which was not, like our own, mere matter of amu&s;ement, but the channel of public in&s;truction, and the in&s;trument of public policy; tho&s;e readers therefore, who are utterly unacquainted with the religion, laws, and cu&s;toms of Athens, are by no means adequate judges

of the marvellous than the probable: an oracle had, it &s;eems, de|clared (for oracles were always ready on the&s;e occa&s;ions) that Ae&s;chylus &s;hould fall by the hand of heaven; accordingly, that this might be fulfill'd, it is reported that an eagle was &s;een in the air, holding in her talons a tortoi&s;e, which (unfortunately for the bard) &s;he let go, and dropping on the head of Ae&s;chylus, who happen'd to be walking beneath, fractured his &s;kull: he is &s;aid to have gain'd thirteen victories over his rival poets, which one would think was an ample recompence for the &s;ingle failure that gave him &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. His tragedies were greatly admired during his life, and after his death held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, in&s;omuch that a decree was pa&s;s'd by the &s;enate, decla|ring, that if any per&s;on would exhibit the tragedies of Ae&s;chylus, the &s;tate would bear the charges of the chorus, and defray the whole expence of the repre&s;entation; an honour, which probably had not been be&s;tow'd on any poet before his time, though after|wards, as I ob&s;erved above, they were generally play'd at the public co&s;t.</P>
<P>AESCHYLUS is a bold, nervous, animated writer; his imagina|tion fertile, but licentious; his judgment true, but ungovern'd; his genius lively, but uncultivated; his &s;entiments noble and &s;ub|lime, but at the &s;ame time wild, irregular, and frequently fanta&s;|tic; his plots, for the mo&s;t part, rude and inartificial; his &s;cenes unconnected, and ill-placed; his language generally poignant and expre&s;&s;ive, though in many places turgid and ob&s;cure, and even too often degenerating into fu&s;tian and bomba&s;t; his cha|racters &s;trongly mark'd, but all partaking of that wild fiercene&s;s, which is the characteri&s;tic of their author; his peculiar excellency was in rai&s;ing terror and a&s;toni&s;hment, in warm and de&s;criptive &s;cenes of war and &s;laughter: if we con&s;ider the &s;tate of the drama when he undertook to reform and improve it, we &s;hall behold him with admiration; if we compare him with his two illu&s;trious &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors

<P>EURIPIDES, fortunately for his own character as well as for po&s;terity, is come down to us more perfect and entire than ei|ther of his cotemporaries; his merit therefore is more ea&s;ily a&s;cer|tain'd; his fables are generally intere&s;ting, his plots frequently irregular and artificial, his characters &s;ometimes unequal, but for the mo&s;t part &s;triking and well contra&s;ted, his &s;entiments remark|ably fine, ju&s;t and proper, his diction &s;oft, elegant, and per|&s;ua&s;ive; he abounds much more in moral apophthegms and reflec|tions than Ae&s;chylus or Sophocles, which as they are not always introduced with propriety give &s;ome of his tragedies a &s;tiff and &s;chola&s;tic appearance, with which the &s;everer critics have not fail'd to reproach him: it is mo&s;t probable however that in this he complied with the ta&s;te of his age, and in obedience to the dictates of his friend and ma&s;ter Socrates, who, we may &s;uppo&s;e, thought it no di&s;grace to this favourite poet, to deviate from the rigid rules of the drama, in order to render it more &s;ub&s;ervient to the noble purpo&s;es of piety and virtue; there is be|&s;ides

<P>IT is &s;aid of Sophocles, that he painted men as they ought to be; of Euripides, that he painted them as they were; a quaint remark, which I &s;hall leave the critics to comment and explain, only ob&s;erving, that the latter is much more familiar than the former, de&s;cends much lower into private life, and con&s;equently lets down in &s;ome mea&s;ure the dignity of the bu&s;kin, which in Sophocles is always carefully &s;upported: there are &s;ome &s;cenes in Euripides where the ideas are &s;o cour&s;e, and the expre&s;&s;ion &s;o low and vulgar, as, if tran&s;lated with the utmo&s;t caution, would perhaps greatly &s;hock the delicacy and refinement of modern manners; the feeling reader notwith&s;tanding will be amply re|compenced by that large portion of the tender and pathetic, the peculiar excellency of this poet, which is diffu&s;ed throughout his works; his choru&s;&s;es are remarkably beautiful and poetical, they do not indeed, as Ari&s;totle has ob&s;erved, always naturally ari&s;e from and corre&s;pond with the incidents of the drama; this fault however his choru&s;&s;es generally make amends for by the harmony of their numbers, and the many fine moral and religious &s;enti|ments, which they contain.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, though Euripides had not perhaps &s;o &s;ublime a genius as Ae&s;chylus, or a judgment &s;o perfect as Sophocles, he &s;eems to have written more to the heart than either of them; and if I were to place him with the other two in the &s;chool of paint|ers, I &s;hould be inclined, from the &s;oftne&s;s of his pencil, to call him the Corregio of the antient drama.</P>

unintere&s;ting, and ill-conducted, the &s;peeches either too long or too &s;hort, the expre&s;&s;ions &s;ometimes cour&s;e and indelicate; in the general management and repre&s;entation of the whole, too much is &s;acrificed to popular prejudice, &s;uper&s;tition and vanity, the ruling pa&s;&s;ions of an Athenian audience: too &s;trong an attachment to the laws, cu&s;toms, and form of government then prevailing, threw a dull air of uniformity over the drama; the &s;ame &s;tory, the &s;ame characters and &s;entiments, even the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions too often occur in different tragedies; that &s;implicity, which &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;h'd the manners of the antients, had naturally it's influ|ence over their ta&s;te al&s;o; they &s;elected one plain but noble ob|ject, and all the variety, which their dramatic poets aim'd at, or which the &s;pectators required of them, was to place that in differ|ent lights, without &s;uffering any other to intercept the pro&s;pect of it; they admitted no epi&s;odes, under-plots, or any of tho&s;e extraneous incidental ornaments, which make up modern perform|ances, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">One of the greate&s;t advantages of modern tragedy over the antient is perhaps, it's judicious de&s;cent from the adventures of demi-gods, kings, and heroes, into the humbler walk of private life, which is much more intere&s;t|ing to the generality of mankind.</NOTE> and confined them&s;eves principally to the faults and perfections of the great, as Milton ob&s;erves of them,
