<HEAD>CAPTAIN COOK's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD. In 1768, 1769, 1770 and 1771.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hort intercou&s;e which the Engli&s;h gentlemen had with the inhabitants of New Holland, prevented them from obtaining &s;o perfect a knowledge of the language of the&s;e people as could have been wi&s;hed; but, as it is an object too curious to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, we &s;hall give our readers the mo&s;t particular account that could be procured. They articulated their words very di&s;tinctly, though they made a great motion with their lips when they were &s;peaking, and their ut|terance was rather vociferous, particularly when they intended to &s;hew their di&s;approbation of any thing. When they were plea&s;ed, they would manife&s;t their &s;atisfaction by &s;aying <HI>hee,</HI> with a long flexion of the voice, in a loud and &s;hril tone. They frequently repeated the word <HI>tut,</HI> when in company with the Engli&s;h, &s;everal times together, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an expre&s;&s;ion of a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration; upon the whole, their language was neither har&s;h nor inharmonious, as will appear from the fol|lowing vocabulary.</P>

<P><PB N="4" REF="5">We &s;hall now proceed to give an account of their pa&s;&s;age from New South Wales to New Guinea, with a recital of the incidents which happened on their landing on the la&s;t men|tioned country.&mdash;Early in the morning of the 24th of Augu&s;t 1770, the cable broke near the ring, in the attempt to weigh the anchor; on which another anchor was dropped, which prevented the &s;hip's driving. As the lo&s;s of an anchor might have been attended with fu|ture ill con&s;equences, the boats were &s;ent to &s;weep for it; but their fir&s;t attempt being un|&s;ucce&s;sful, they were di&s;patched again in the afternoon, when it was found, and the &s;hip being brought up to it, they weighed it; yet, unfortunately, ju&s;t as they were going to &s;hip it, the haw&s;er &s;lipped, and all their labour was fru&s;trated. Determined, however, not to lo&s;e the anchor, they re-applied their endeavours on the following morning, when they were at|tended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after the anchor was weighed, the &s;hip got under &s;ail, &s;teering north-we&s;t, and in a few hours one of the boats, which was a-head, made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal-water. The &s;hip in|&s;tantly brought to, with all her &s;ails &s;tanding, and a &s;urvey being taken of the &s;ea around her, it was found that &s;he had met with another narrow e&s;cape, as &s;he was almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;hoals; and was likewi&s;e &s;o &s;ituated be|tween them, that &s;he mu&s;t have &s;truck before
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the boat's crew had made the &s;ignal, if &s;he had been half the length of a cable on either &s;ide. In the afternoon &s;he made &s;ail with the ebb tide, and got out of danger before &s;un-&s;et, when &s;he brought to for the night.</P>
<P>The meeting with the&s;e &s;hoals having deter|mined the Captain to alter his intended cour&s;e, he &s;ailed again the next morning (Sunday the 26th) and &s;oon got into deep water. They now &s;teered a we&s;tward cour&s;e, and, as no land was within &s;ight, held it on till the du&s;k of the evening, when they &s;hortened &s;ail, and made oppo&s;ite tacks during the night. The next morning they pur&s;ued their voyage, again &s;hortening &s;ail at night, and tacking till day-break of the 28th, when they &s;teered due north, in &s;earch of New Guinea.</P>
<P>They now ob&s;erved many parts of the &s;ea covered with a kind of brown &s;cum, to which the &s;ailors gave the name of Spawn. It is formed of an incredible number of minute particles, each of which, when &s;een through the micro&s;cope, was found to con&s;i&s;t of a con|&s;iderable number of tubes, and the&s;e tubes were &s;ubdivided into little cells. The &s;cum being burnt, and yeilding no &s;mell like what is pro|duced by animal &s;ub&s;tances, it was concluded that it was of the vegetable kind. This &s;cum, which has been often &s;een on the coa&s;t of Bra|zil, generally makes its appearance near the land.&mdash;A bird, which is called the Noddy,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
was found this evening among the rigging of the &s;hip. Land having been &s;een this day from the ma&s;t-head, they &s;tood off and on all night, and at day-break they &s;ailed towards it with a bri&s;k gale.</P>
<P>Between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock they had &s;ight of a &s;mall i&s;land, di&s;tant about three miles from the main land, which has already been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the names of St. Bartholomew, and Whermoy&s;en. It is a very flat i&s;land, clothed with trees, among which is the cocoa-nut; and was judged to be inhabited, by the &s;moke of fires which were &s;een on &s;everal parts of it. The boats were now &s;ent out to &s;ound, as the water was &s;hallow; but as the &s;hip, in &s;ailing two leagues, had found no increa&s;e in its depth, &s;ig|nals were made for the boats to return on board, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;tood out to &s;ea till midnight, and then tacked, and &s;tood in for land till the morning. When they were about four leagues di&s;tant from it, they had &s;ight of it from the deck, and its appearance was &s;till flat and woody. Abundance of the brown &s;cum was &s;till &s;een on the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and the Tars, convinced that it was not &s;pawn, gave it the whim&s;ical name of Sea-&s;aw-du&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;hip now held a northward cour&s;e, bare|ly within &s;ight of land, till the 3d of Septem|ber; and as the water was but ju&s;t deep enough to navigate the ve&s;&s;el, many un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts were made to bring her near enough to
<PB N="7" REF="8">
get on &s;hore: it was therefore determined to land in one of the boats, while the &s;hip kept plying off and on.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, on the 3d of September, the Captain, accompanied by Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander, and attended by the boat's crew and Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, &s;et out in the pinnace; but when they came within two hundred yards of the &s;hore the water was &s;o &s;hallow, that they were obliged to leave the boat, in the care of two of the &s;ailors, and wade to land. They were no &s;ooner clear of the wa|ter, than they &s;aw &s;everal prints of human feet on the &s;and, below high-water-mark, from whence it was evident, that the natives had been very lately there. About one hundred yards from the water there was a thick wood, along the borders of which they walked till they ar|rived on the banks of a brook of water, on which was &s;ituated a fine grove of cocoa-nut trees, which abounded with fruit.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the trees &s;tood an Indian hut, which had been thatched with their leaves, of which &s;ome yet remained; and round the hut were &s;cattered many cocoa-nut-&s;hells, the fruit of which &s;eemed to have been lately gathered. Not far from this grew the bread-fruit tree, and a number of plantains.</P>
<P>Our adventurers were now near a quarter of a mile from the pinnace, when three of the na|tives ran out of the woods, about one hundred
<PB N="8" REF="9">
yards beyond them, &s;houting in the mo&s;t vio|lent manner. They in&s;tantly ran towards our countrymen, the fir&s;t of the three throwing &s;omething out of his hand, which flew on one &s;ide of him, burning in the &s;ame manner as gunpowder, but making no noi&s;e, while the other two threw their lances. The Engli&s;h now fired; when the natives &s;topped, and ca&s;t another lance, on which the mu&s;kets were load|ed with ball, and again fired.&mdash;The poor Indians now ran off with expedition, having, mo&s;t pro|bably, been wounded in the unequal conflict. Captain Cook and his companions, unwilling far|ther to injure tho&s;e who could not originally have intended them any harm, retreated ha&s;tily to the boat, while the men, that had been left in the care of her, made &s;ignals that more of the na|tives were advancing towards the coa&s;t; &s;everal of the&s;e were &s;oon &s;een, and &s;tood &s;till, as if waiting for the main body of their companions. Captain Cook and the party having reached the boat, rowed a-brea&s;t of the natives, who by this time were a&s;&s;embled to the number of about eighty. Their &s;tature was nearly the &s;ame with that of the inhabitants of New South Wales, but their colour was not quite &s;o dark: but, like them, they wore their hair cropped &s;hort. During the &s;urvey that was taken of them, they continued letting off their fires, a few at a time, in a kind of regular platoons; they were di&s;|charged by means of a piece of &s;tick, almo&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="10">
like a hollow cane, which being &s;wung &s;ide|ways, produced fire and &s;moke exactly like that occa&s;ioned by the firing of &s;mall arms. The crew on board the &s;hip &s;aw this &s;trange phenomenon, and thought the natives had fire|arms. The gentlemen having &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity by attentively looking at the&s;e people, fired &s;ome mu&s;quets above their heads, the balls from which being heard to rattle among the trees, the natives deliberately retired. The lances which had been thrown &s;oon after the gen|tlemen landed were made of a reed or bamboo cane, and the points were made of hard wood, barbed in &s;everal places; it is imagined, that the&s;e lances were di&s;charged by means of a throwing &s;tick, as they flew with great &s;wift|ne&s;s above &s;ixty yards.</P>
<P>When this party returned to the &s;hip, &s;ome of the officers entreated the Captain to &s;end men on &s;hore to cut down the cocoa-nut trees, in order to procure the nuts; but this, with equal wi&s;dom and humanity, he refu&s;ed; &s;en|&s;ible that the poor Indians, who could ill brook even the landing of a &s;mall party, on their coa&s;t, would ri&s;k their lives, and of cour&s;e &s;a|crifice them, in defence of their property. The whole coa&s;t of this country is low-land, but cloathed with a richne&s;s of trees and her|bage, which exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>On Monday, the 3d of September, 1770, the &s;hip got under &s;ail, and early in the morning
<PB N="10" REF="11">
of the 6th pa&s;&s;ed two &s;mall i&s;lands, on the lat|ter of which Captain Cook would have landed, but as they had then only ten fathom water, and as the ground was rocky and the wind blew fre&s;h, he might have endangered the &s;afety of the &s;hip. They now &s;ailed at a moderate rate, with various &s;oundings, till three o'clock the next morning, after which they had no ground with one hundred and twenty fathom. Before noon they had &s;ight of land, which was con|jectured to be either the Arrou I&s;lands, or Ti|mor Laoet; but they are not accurately laid down in any of the charts hitherto publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 9th they &s;aw what had the appearance of land, and the next morn|ing were convinced that the fir&s;t land they had &s;een was Timor, and the la&s;t Timor Laoet. The &s;hip &s;tood off and on during the night, when a number of fires were &s;een on the i&s;land, and the next morning &s;moke was &s;een in &s;eve|ral places, from whence it was conjectured that the place was well peopled. The land near the &s;hore was covered with high trees, not unlike pines; farther back were cocoa-trees and man|groves: there were many &s;alt-water creeks, and &s;everal &s;pots of ground which appeared to have been cleared by art; and the whole country ro&s;e, by gradual &s;lopes, into hills of a very con|&s;iderable height.</P>
<P>As the land and &s;ea breezes were now very &s;light, they continued in &s;ight of the i&s;land for
<PB N="11" REF="12">
two days, when it was ob&s;erved that the hills reached, in many places, quite to the &s;ea coa&s;t, and where that was not the ca&s;e, there were large and noble groves of the cocoa-nut tree, which ran about a mile up the country, at which di&s;|tance great numbers of hou&s;es and plantations were &s;een: the plantations were &s;urrounded with fences, and extended nearly to the &s;um|mits of the mo&s;t lofty hills, yet neither the natives nor cattle were &s;een on any of them, which was thought a very extraordinary circum|&s;tance. Fine groves of the fan-palm &s;haded the hou&s;es from the rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>On the 16th they had &s;ight of the little i&s;land called ROTTE; and the &s;ame day &s;aw the i&s;land SEMAU, at a di&s;tance to the &s;outhward of Ti|mor. The i&s;land of Rotte is chiefly covered with bru&s;hy wood without leaves; but there are a number of fan-palm trees on it, growing near the &s;andy beaches; and the whole con&s;i&s;ts of alternate hills and vallies. The i&s;land of Semau is not &s;o hilly as Timor, but re&s;embles it greatly in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock this night a dull reddi&s;h light was &s;een in the air, many parts of which emit|ted rays of a brighter colour, which &s;oon va|ni&s;hed, and were &s;ucceeded by others of the &s;ame kind. This phenomenon, which reached about ten degrees above the horizon, bore a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance to the Aurora Borealis, only that the rays of light which it emitted had
<PB N="12" REF="13">
no tremulous motion. It was &s;urveyed for two hours, during which time its brightne&s;s con|tinued undimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>As the &s;hip was now clear of all the i&s;lands which had been laid down in &s;uch maps as were on board, they made &s;ail during the night, and were &s;urprized the next morning at the &s;ight of an i&s;land to the we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t, which they flattered them&s;elves was a new di&s;covery. Be|fore noon they had &s;ight of hou&s;es, groves of cocoa-nut trees, and large flocks of &s;heep. This was a welcome &s;ight to people who&s;e health was declining for want of refre&s;hments; and it was in&s;tantly re&s;olved to attempt the purcha&s;e of what they &s;tood &s;o much in need of. The &s;econd Lieutenant was immediately di&s;patched in the pinnace, in &s;earch of a land|ing-place; and he took with him &s;uch things as it was thought might be acceptable to the natives.</P>
<P>During Mr. Gore's ab&s;ence, the people on board &s;aw two men on hor&s;eback upon the hills, who frequently &s;topped to take a view of the ve&s;&s;el. The Lieutenant &s;oon returned, with an account that he had entered a little cove, near which &s;tood a few hou&s;es: that &s;everal men advanced, and invited him to land; and that they conver&s;ed together as well as they could by &s;igns. He reported that the&s;e people were very like the Malays, both in per&s;on and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
dre&s;s; that they had no other arms but a knife, which each of them wore &s;tuck in his girdle.</P>
<P>As the Lieutenant could not find any place in which the &s;hip might come to an an|chor, he was di&s;patched again with money and goods, to buy &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as were imme|diately wanted for tho&s;e who were &s;ick. Dr. Solander attended the Lieutenant, and, during their ab&s;ence, the &s;hip &s;tood on and off the &s;hore. Soon after the boat had put off, two other hor&s;emen were &s;een from the &s;hip, one of whom had a laced hat on, and was dre&s;&s;ed in a coat and wai&s;tcoat, of the fa&s;hion of Europe. The&s;e men rode about on &s;hore, taking little notice of the boat, but regarding the &s;hip with the utmo&s;t attention. As &s;oon as the boat reached the &s;hore, &s;ome other per&s;ons on hor&s;e|back, and many on foot, ha&s;tened to the &s;pot, and it was ob&s;erved that &s;ome cocoa-nuts were put into the boat, from whence it was con|cluded, that a traffick had commenced with the natives. A &s;ignal being made from the boat, that the &s;hip might anchor in a bay at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;he immediately bore away for it.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant came on board, he re|ported that he could not purcha&s;e any cocoa-nuts, as the owner of them was ab&s;ent, and that what he had brought were given him; in return for which he had pre&s;ented the natives with &s;ome linen. The method by which he
<PB N="14" REF="15">
learnt that there was a harbour in the neighbour|hood, was by the natives drawing a kind of rude map on the &s;and, in which the harbour, and a town near it were repre&s;ented; it was likewi&s;e hinted to him that fruit, fowls, hogs, and &s;heep, might be there obtained in great abundance. He &s;aw &s;everal of the principal inhabitants of the i&s;land, who wore chains of gold about their necks, and were dre&s;&s;ed in fine linen. The word <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> being frequently repeated by the Indians, it was conjectured, that &s;ome natives of Portugal were on the i&s;land, and one of the boat's crew being of that king|dom, he &s;poke to the i&s;landers in his own lan|guage, but he &s;oon found that they had only learnt a few words, of which they did not know the meaning. While the natives were endeavouring to repre&s;ent the &s;ituation of the town near the harbour, one of them, in order to be more particular in directions, informed the Engli&s;h that they would &s;ee &s;omething, which he endeavoured to de&s;cribe by placing his fingers acro&s;s each other; and the Portu|gue&s;e &s;ailor took it for granted, that he could mean nothing but a cro&s;s. When the boat's crew were on the point of returning to the &s;hip, the gentleman who had been &s;een on hor&s;eback in the dre&s;s of Europe came down to the beach; but the Lieutenant did not think it proper to hold a conference with him, becau&s;e he had left his commi&s;&s;ion on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">In the evening, when the &s;hip had entered the bay to which they had been recommended, an Indian town was &s;een at a &s;mall di&s;tance; upon which a jack was hoi&s;ted on the fore-top-ma&s;t head: pre&s;ently afterwards three guns were fired, and Dutch colours were hoi&s;ted in the town: the &s;hip, however, held on her way, and came to an anchor at &s;even in the evening.</P>
<P>The colours being &s;een hoi&s;ted on the beach the next morning, the Captain concluded, that the Dutch had a &s;ettlement on the i&s;land: he therefore di&s;patched the &s;econd Lieutenant, to acquaint the Governor, or other principal re|&s;ident, who they were, and that the &s;hip had put in for nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments. The Lieu|tenant having landed, he was received by a kind of guard of &s;omething more than twenty In|dians, armed with mu&s;kets, who having taken down the colours from the beach, proceeded without the lea&s;t military order; and thus e&s;|corted him to the town where the colours had been hoi&s;ted the preceding evening.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant was now conducted to the Raja, or King of the i&s;land, to whom, by means of a Portugue&s;e interpreter, he made known his bu&s;ine&s;s. The Raja &s;aid, he was rea|dy to &s;upply the &s;hip with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ments; but that he could not trade with any other people but the Dutch, with whom he was in alliance, without having fir&s;t obtained their con&s;ent; but that he would make application
<PB N="16" REF="17">
to the Dutch Agent, who was the only white man among them. To this Agent, who&s;e name was Lange, and who proved to be the per&s;on that was &s;een from the &s;hip in the Euro|pean dre&s;s, a letter was di&s;patched; and in a few hours he came to the town, behaved po|litely to the Lieutenant, and told him, he might buy what he thought proper of the inha|bitants of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>This offer being freely made, and readily ac|cepted, the Raja and Mr. Lange intimated their wi&s;hes to go on board the &s;hip, and that two of the boat's crew might be left as ho&s;tages for their &s;afe return. The Lieutenant gratified both the&s;e reque&s;ts, and took them on board ju&s;t before dinner was &s;erved. It was thought that they would have &s;at down without ceremo|ny; but, after &s;ome he&s;itation, the Raja inti|mated his doubts, whether, being a black, they would permit him to &s;it down with them. The politene&s;s of the officers &s;oon removed his &s;cruples, and the greate&s;t good humour and fe&s;|tivity prevailed among them. As Dr. Solan|der, and another gentleman on board, were to|lerable proficients in Dutch, they acted as inter|preters between Mr. Lange and the officers, while &s;ome of the &s;ailors, who under&s;tood Por|tugue&s;e, conver&s;ed with &s;uch of the Raja's at|tendants as &s;poke that language. The chief part of the dinner was mutton, which the Raja having ta&s;ted, he begged an Engli&s;h &s;heep, and
<PB N="17" REF="18">
the only one which they had left was given him: he then a&s;ked for a dog, and Mr. Banks gave him his grey-hound; and a &s;pying-gla&s;s was pre&s;ented to him, on Mr. Lange's intimating that it would be acceptable.</P>
<P>The vi&s;itors now told Captain Cook, that there was great plenty of fowls, hogs, &s;heep and buffaloes on the i&s;land, numbers of which &s;hould be conveyed to the &s;ea &s;hore on the fol|lowing day, that he might purcha&s;e what was nece&s;&s;ary for the recovery of the &s;ick, and for &s;ea &s;tores. This welcome news gave great &s;pi|rits to the company, and the bottle went &s;o bri&s;kly round, that Mr. Lange and his compa|nions became almo&s;t intoxicated: they had, however, the re&s;olution to expre&s;s a de&s;ire to depart, before they were quite drunk. When they came upon deck, the marines were under arms to receive them; and the Raja intimating, that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee them exerci&s;e, the Captain gave orders that he &s;hould be indulged, and three rounds were fired: he was equally plea&s;ed and &s;urprized at their manoeuvres, and particularly charmed when they cocked their firelocks, exclaiming violently, <Q REND="inline">"that all the locks made but one click."</Q> This being ended, Me&s;&s;rs. Solander and Banks went a&s;hore with the vi&s;itors, who were &s;aluted at their depar|ture with nine guns, which they returned with three cheers.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">When they came to the town, the Engli&s;h gentlemen ta&s;ted their palm wine, which was &s;weet, and not unplea&s;ant: it is made of the fre&s;h juice of the tree, without being ferment|ed. The hou&s;es of the natives con&s;i&s;ted of no|thing more than a floor of boards, over which was a roof of thatch, &s;upported by pillars about four feet in height.</P>
<P>On the following day the Captain, attended by &s;everal gentlemen, went on &s;hore to return the Raja's vi&s;it; but their principal intention was, to buy the refre&s;hments which had been mentioned the preceding day. When they landed, they were chagrined to find, that the cattle had not been driven down to the beach. They went on to the town, where they ob&s;erved, that the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, and &s;ome few other hou&s;es which had been built by the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the hou&s;es of the natives by having a piece of wood, almo&s;t in the &s;hape of cows horns, fix|ed at each end of the roof; and the&s;e they con|cluded were what the Portugue&s;e &s;ailor had ima|gined to be cro&s;&s;es, from the Indian having cro&s;&s;ed his fingers when he was de&s;cribing the town.</P>
<P>The Raja was at the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, &s;ur|rounded by many of his principal &s;ubjects; and Mr. Lange al&s;o attended. Captain Cook having informed them, that he had loaded his boat with goods, which he wi&s;hed to ex|change
<PB N="19" REF="20">
for nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, permi&s;&s;i|on was given him to land his effects. The Captain now endeavoured to make an agree|ment for the hogs, &s;heep, and buffaloes, which were to be paid for in ca&s;h; but this bu&s;ine&s;s was no &s;ooner hinted at than Mr. Lange took his leave, having fir&s;t told the Captain, that he mu&s;t make his agreement with the natives; and adding, that he had received a letter from the Governor of Concordia, in Timor, the con|tents of which &s;hould be di&s;clo&s;ed at his return.</P>
<P>As they had now no fre&s;h provi&s;ions on board, the gentlemen were unwilling to return to the &s;hip before they had dined; they there|fore reque&s;ted the Raja's permi&s;&s;ion to buy a &s;mall hog and &s;ome rice, and hoped he would order his people to dre&s;s the dinner. To this the Raja very obligingly replied, that if the gentlemen had &s;tomachs to eat of Indian cooke|ry, he would have the honour of con&s;idering them as his gue&s;ts. A dinner being thus pro|cured, the Captain &s;ent off the boat to bring li|quors from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Late in the afternoon the company &s;at down on mats, which had been &s;pread for them on the floor, having been fir&s;t conducted to a &s;er|vant, who had a ve&s;&s;el made of the leaves of the fan-palm, containing water to wa&s;h their hands, in which the Indian a&s;&s;i&s;ted them. Hav|ing waited &s;ome time for the Raja, they enquir|ed the rea&s;on of his ab&s;ence, and were inform|ed,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
that the per&s;on who gave the entertainment never partook of it; but that the Raja was rea|dy to come and ta&s;te of what was provided, if the gentlemen entertained any idea that the meat was unwhole&s;ome: having a&s;&s;ured the natives, that they did not harbour any &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, they began their dinner, which con&s;i&s;ted of pork and rice, very excellent of their kinds, &s;erved up in thirty-&s;ix di&s;hes, and three earthen bowls filled with a kind of broth, in which the pork had been boiled: the &s;poons were formed of leaves, but were &s;o &s;mall, that the hunger of the gue&s;ts would &s;carcely allow them patience to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>When dinner was ended, the Captain invited the Raja to drink wine with him; but this he declined, &s;aying, that the man who entertained company &s;hould never get drunk with his gue&s;ts, and that the only certain way to avoid drunk|enne&s;s, was to refrain from ta&s;ting the liquor. The gentlemen left the remains of their dinner to their &s;ervants and the boat's crew, who not being able to eat it all, the Raja's female &s;ervants, who came to take away the uten&s;ils, in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould take with them all that remained.</P>
<P>When the bottle had circulated &s;ome time, Captain Cook began to enquire after the cattle that were promi&s;ed to be driven down to the beach; when Mr. Lange informed him, that in the letter which he had received from the
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Governor of Concordia, in&s;tructions were given, that if the &s;hip &s;hould touch at the i&s;land, and be in want of provi&s;ions, &s;he &s;hould be &s;uppli|ed; but that he was not to permit her to remain longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: that no pre&s;ents were to be made to the natives of low rank, nor even left with their &s;uperiors to be divided among them after the &s;hip had &s;ailed: but, he added, that any trifling civilities receiv|ed from the Indians, might be acknowledged by a pre&s;ent of beads, or other articles of very &s;mall value. It is a very probable conjecture, that the whole of this &s;tory was of Mr. Lange's own manufacture, and &s;olely calculated to draw all the pre&s;ents of any value into his own pocket.</P>
<P>Soon after this the Captain was informed, that &s;ome &s;heep had been driven down to the beach; but had been conveyed away before the men could get money from the &s;hip to pay for them; and that not a &s;ingle hog or buffaloe had been driven down: but that a &s;mall number of fowls, and a quantity of the palm-&s;yrup had been bought. Heartily vexed to be thus di&s;|appointed of the chief articles which were wanted, the Captain remon&s;trated with Mr. Lange, who told him, that if he and his offi|cers had gone to the &s;pot, they might have pur|cha&s;ed any thing they plea&s;ed; but that the In|dians imagined, the &s;eamen would impo&s;e on them with counterfeit money.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">This &s;tory was no more credited than the former; but not to lo&s;e more time in a ca&s;e of &s;uch urgency, the Captain in&s;tantly repaired to the beach; but there were no cattle to be bought. During his ab&s;ence Lange informed Mr. Banks, that the Indians were offended, that the &s;eamen had not offered gold for what they had to &s;ell, and that no other metal would pur|cha&s;e their commodities: but Mr. Banks, di&s;|daining to hold farther conver&s;ation with a man who had been guilty of &s;uch repeated &s;ubter|fuges, left him abruptly. Some hours before this, the Raja had a&s;&s;igned a much more pro|bable rea&s;on for the cattle not being brought to the beach, &s;aying, that the buffaloes were too far up the country to be driven thither in the time. In the evening the gentlemen returned to the &s;hip, not a little di&s;plea&s;ed at their di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>On the 20th the Captain and doctor Solander went again on &s;hore, and while the latter pro|ceeded to the town in &s;earch of Lange, the Captain &s;taid on the beach, with a view to buy cattle. At this place was an old man, who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the prime mini&s;ter, becau&s;e he appeared to be inve&s;ted with con&s;iderable authority; and the Captain now pre&s;ented him with a &s;pying-gla&s;s, in order to make a friend of him. At pre&s;ent there was nothing brought for &s;ale but a &s;mall buffaloe, for which five guineas were demanded. Tho'
<PB N="23" REF="24">
the Captain knew that this was double its value, yet he bid three guineas, as he was willing to begin dealing at any rate: the per&s;on who had it to &s;ell &s;aid, he could not take the money till the Raja had been informed what was offered; on which a man was &s;ent to him, who &s;oon came back with a ma&s;&s;age, that five guineas would be the lowe&s;t price: this the Captain re|fu&s;ed to give; on which a &s;econd me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched, who &s;taying a long time, Captain Cook was anxiou&s;ly expecting his return, when he &s;aw Dr. Solander coming towards the beach, e&s;corted by more than a hundred per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom had lances in their hands, and the re&s;t were armed with mu&s;kets. When the Doctor arrived at the marketing-place, he informed the Captain, that Lange had interpreted to him a me&s;&s;age from the Raja, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, that the natives were aver&s;e to all traffick with the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e they would not give above half the real worth of the things which were offered for &s;ale; and that all trading what|ever &s;hould be prohibited after that day.</P>
<P>A native of Timor, who&s;e parents were Por|tugue&s;e, came down with this party, and deli|vered to the Captain what was pretended to be the order of the Raja, and which was in &s;ub|&s;tance the &s;ame as what Lange had told Dr. So|lander; but it was afterwards di&s;covered, that this man was a confederate of Lange's, in the &s;cheme of extortion. The Engli&s;h gentlemen
<PB N="24" REF="25">
had at the &s;ame time no boubt, but that the &s;uppo&s;ed order of the Raja was a contrivance of the&s;e men; and while they were debating how they &s;hould act in this critical conjuncture, anx|ious to bring the affair to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue, the Portugue&s;e began to drive away &s;uch of the na|tives as had brought palm-&s;yrup and fowls to &s;ell, and others who were now bringing &s;heep and buffaloes to the market.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this juncture Captain Cook happen|ing to look at the old man who had been di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of prime mini&s;ter, im|agined that he &s;aw in his features a di&s;approba|tion of the pre&s;ent proceedings; and, willing to improve the advantage, he gra&s;ped the Indi|an's hand, and gave him an old broad &s;word. This well-timed pre&s;ent produced all the good effects that could be wi&s;hed: the prime mini&s;ter was enraptured at &s;o honourable a mark of di&s;|tinction, and, brandi&s;hing his &s;word over the head of the impertinent Portugue&s;e, he made both him, and a man who commanded the par|ty, &s;it down behind him on the ground. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s was now accompli&s;hed: the na|tives, eager to &s;upply whatever was wanted, brought their cattle in for &s;ale, and the market was &s;oon &s;tocked. For the fir&s;t two buffaloes Captain Cook gave ten guineas; but he after|wards purcha&s;ed them by way of exchange, giving a mu&s;ket for each; and at this rate he might have bought any number he thought pro|per.
<PB N="25" REF="26">
There &s;eems to be no doubt but that Lange had a profit out of the fir&s;t two that were &s;old, and that his rea&s;on for having &s;aid that the natives would take nothing but gold for their cattle, was, that he might the more ea&s;ily &s;hare in the produce. Captain Cook pur|cha&s;ed of the natives of this i&s;land &s;ome hun|dred gallons of palm-&s;yrup, a &s;mall quantity of garlick, a large number of eggs, &s;ome limes and cocoa-nuts, thirty dozen of fowls, three hogs, &s;ix &s;heep, and nine buffaloes.</P>
<P>Having at length obtained the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hments, Captain Cook prepared for &s;ailing from this place; but before we attend him on his voyage, it may be proper to give a de&s;crip|tion of the i&s;land, with an account of its pro|duce, and the cu&s;toms and manners of its in|habitants.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of SAVU is &s;ituated in 10 degrees 35 minutes &s;outh latitude, and 237 degrees 30 minutes we&s;t longitude, and has hitherto been very little known, or very imperfectly de&s;crib|ed. Its length is between twenty and thirty miles; but its breadth could not be a&s;certained by Captain Cook, who &s;aw only the north &s;ide of it. The harbour in which the &s;hip lay was called Seba, from a di&s;trict of the country &s;o denominated; and there are two other bays on different parts of the i&s;land. At the time the Endeavour lay there it was near the end of the dry &s;ea&s;on, when it had not rained for al|mo&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;even months, nor was there a running &s;tream of fre&s;h water to be &s;een, and the na|tives were &s;upplied only by &s;mall &s;prings, &s;itu|ated at a di&s;tance up the country: yet even in this dry &s;ea&s;on the appearance of the i&s;land was enchanting beyond de&s;cription. Near the coa&s;t the land is level, and well clothed with the palm, called <HI>Arecas,</HI> and cocoa-nut trees: far|ther off the ground ri&s;es in the mo&s;t gradual a&s;cent, and is covered with fan palm trees even to the tops of the hills, &s;o as to pre&s;ent a regu|lar grove to the eye. The rains in this country cea&s;e in March or April, and fall again in Octo|ber or November: and the&s;e rains produce abundance of indico, millet, and maize, which grow beneath the noble&s;t trees in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e articles, the i&s;land produces to|bacco, cotton, betle, tamarinds, limes, oran|ges, mangoes, Guinea corn, rice, callevances, and water melons. A trifling quantity of cin|namon was &s;een, and &s;ome European herbs, &s;uch as garlic, fennel, cellery and marjoram: be|&s;ides which, there are fruits of various kinds, and particularly the <HI>blimbi,</HI> which has a &s;harp ta&s;te, and is &s;aid to be a very fine pickle, but it is not eaten raw; its length is from three to four inches, it is nearly as thick as a man's thumb, of an oval form, covered with a very thin &s;kin of a light green, and contains a number of &s;eeds ranged in the &s;hape of a &s;tar.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">Several buffaloes were &s;een on this i&s;land, which were almo&s;t as large as an ox; and from a pair of enormous horns of this animal which Mr. Banks &s;aw, it was conjectured, that &s;ome of them were much larger; yet they did not weigh more than half as much as an ox of the &s;ame apparent &s;ize, having lo&s;t the greater part of their fle&s;h through the late dry weather; the meat however was juicy, and of a delicate flavour. The horns of the&s;e animals bend backwards, they have no dewlaps, nor &s;carce any hair on their &s;kins, and their ears are re|markably large. The other tame animals on the i&s;land are dogs, cats, pigeons, fowls, hogs, goats, &s;heep, a&s;&s;es and hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Few of the hor&s;es are above twelve hands high, yet they are full of mettle, and pace na|turally in an expeditious manner: the natives ride them with a halter only. The hogs of this country, are fed on the hu&s;ks of rice, and palm-&s;yrup mixed with water, and are remarkably fine and fat. The &s;heep are not unlike a goat, and are therefore called cabritos; their ears, which are long, hang down under their horns; their no&s;es are arched, and their bodies are co|vered with hair. The fowls are of the game kind, and though they are rather large, the hen lays a very &s;mall egg. The &s;ea-coa&s;t furni&s;hes the inhabitants with turtle, but not in any great abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">The natives of the i&s;land of Savu are ra|ther below the middle &s;tature; their hair is black and &s;trait, and per&s;ons of all ranks, as well tho&s;e that are expo&s;ed to the weather, as tho&s;e that are not, have one general complexion, which is the dark brown. The men are well formed and &s;prightly, and their features differ much from each other: the women, on the con|trary, have all one &s;et of features, and are very &s;hort and broad built.</P>
<P>The men have &s;ilver pincers hanging by &s;trings round their necks, with which they pluck out the hair of their beards; and both men and women root out the hair that grows under the arms: the hair of the womens heads is tied in a club behind, while that of the men is fa&s;ten|ed by a comb to the top of the head: the men wear a kind of turban on the head, formed of mu&s;lin, cotton, or even &s;ilk handkerchiefs; but the heads of the women have no covering.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men con&s;i&s;ts of two pieces of cotton cloth, one of which is bound round the middle, and the lower edge of it being drawn pretty tight between the legs, the upper edge is left loo&s;e, &s;o as to form a kind of pocket, in which they carry their knives and other things: the other piece being pa&s;&s;ed under the former, on the back of the wearer, the ends of it are carried over the &s;houlders, and tucked into the pocket before. The women draw the upper edge of the piece round the wai&s;t tight, while
<PB N="29" REF="30">
the lower edge, dropping to the knees, makes a kind of petticoat: the other piece of cloth is fa&s;tened acro&s;s the brea&s;t, and under the arms. This cloth, which is manufactured by the na|tives, is died blue while in the yarn; and, as it is of various &s;hades, its look when it comes to be worn is very beautiful.</P>
<P>The ornaments of the natives of Savu are very numerous, and con&s;i&s;t of rings, beads worn round the neck and on the wri&s;ts, and chains of plaited gold wire, likewi&s;e worn round the neck: the&s;e things were worn by both &s;exes; but the women had likewi&s;e girdles of beads round their wai&s;ts, which helped to keep up the petticoat. Many of the boys wore bra&s;s wire pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times round the arms, above the elbow: and &s;ome of the men, who were &s;aid to be the &s;ons of the Rajas, wore rings of ivory, above an inch thick, and two inches broad, on the &s;ame part of the arm. One man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ilver-headed cane, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a pre&s;ent from the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, as their mark was engraven on the &s;ilver. The Raja, and the principal officer of his hou&s;hold, were commonly habited in night gowns of or|dinary chintz; but one time, when Captain Cook waited on the Raja, he was dre&s;&s;ed in a black &s;tuff robe.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the men had their names marked on their arms, and the women a black ornament ju&s;t under the bend of the elbow, impre&s;&s;ed &s;o
<PB N="30" REF="31">
that it could not be rubbed out. On enquiry it was found, that this practice had been common among the Indians long before they were vi|&s;ited by any Europeans; and it was &s;aid, that the necks and brea&s;ts of the inhabitants of the adjacent i&s;lands were marked with circles.</P>
<P>It could not be certainly known how the&s;e black marks were impre&s;&s;ed; but the following extract from M. Bo&s;&s;u's account of &s;ome Indians who dwell on the banks of the Akanza, a river in North America, will afford a very pro|bable conjecture how the operation is perform|ed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Akanzas (&s;ays this writer) have adopted me, and, as a mark of my privilege, have imprinted the figure of a roe-buck upon my thigh, which was done in this manner: an Indian having burnt &s;ome &s;traw, diluted the a&s;hes with water, and, with this mixture, drew the figure upon my &s;kin; he then retraced it by pricking the lines with needles, &s;o as at every juncture ju&s;t to draw the blood, and the blood mixing with the a&s;hes of the &s;traw, forms a figure which can never be effaced."</Q></P>
<P>The hou&s;es on the i&s;land of Savu are of dif|ferent lengths, from twenty feet to four hun|dred, according to the rank of the inhabitant, and are fixed on po&s;ts about four or five feet from the ground. The hou&s;es are generally di|vided into three rooms of equal &s;ize, the center room being &s;et apart for the u&s;e of the women;

and &s;ometimes &s;maller rooms are enclo&s;ed from the &s;ides of the building, the whole of which is thatched with the leaves of the palm-tree.</P>
<P>The natives eat of all the tame animals which the i&s;land produces, but they prefer the hog to all the re&s;t; next to hogs fle&s;h they admire that of the hor&s;e, to which &s;ucceeds the Buffalo, and then the poultry; and they like the fle&s;h of cats and dogs much better than that of goats and &s;heep. Fi&s;h is not eaten but by the poorer people, nor even by them, but when &s;ome bu|&s;ine&s;s demands their attendance near the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and then each man has a &s;mall ca&s;ting net, which he wears tied round his body when he has not occa&s;ion to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>The fan-palm is the mo&s;t remarkable, and mo&s;t u&s;eful tree that grows on the i&s;land, its u&s;es being equally great and various: &s;oon af|ter the buds put forth the natives cut them, and tying under them little ba&s;kets formed of the leaves of the tree, a liquor drops into them, which has the ta&s;te of a light wine, and is the common liquor of all the inhabitants. The men climb the trees twice a day to bring down this liquor; but as a great deal more is thus obtained than can be con&s;umed by drinking, a part of the remainder is made into coar&s;e &s;u|gar, very excellent of its kind; and the re&s;t is boiled in earthen pots, till it is reduced to a &s;yrup, re&s;embling treacle, but of a much finer flavour; and with this &s;yrup the natives fatten
<PB N="32" REF="33">
their hogs and dogs. The leaves of the tree are applied to the various u&s;es of making to|bacco-pipes, umbrellas, cups, ba&s;kets, and the thatching of hou&s;es. The fruit of this tree is nearly of the &s;ize of a full grown turnip; but the natives are not fond of it, nor do they &s;uffer much of it to come to perfection, as they wound the blo&s;&s;oms for the &s;ake of the liquor that di&s;tils from them; the kernels of the fruit mu&s;t be eaten before it is ripe, otherwi&s;e they are &s;o hard, that the teeth will not penetrate them.</P>
<P>As wood for firing is very &s;carce on the i&s;land, the natives, by the following method, make a very little of it an&s;wer the ends of cookery and di&s;tillation. A hollow is dug under ground, in a direct line, about two yards long, with a hole at each end, one of which is large and the other &s;mall; the fire is put in at the large&s;t hole, while the &s;maller one &s;erves for a draught. Circular holes are made through the earth, which covers this cavity; and on the&s;e holes are &s;et earthen pots, which being large in the middle, and &s;maller to|wards the bottom, the fire acts upon a con|&s;iderable part of their &s;urface. The&s;e pots contain, mo&s;t commonly, about eight or nine gallons each, and they are kept continually boiling, with a very trifling quantity of fuel, &s;uch as a palm-leaf, or a dry &s;talk; in this
<PB N="33" REF="34">
manner all their victuals are boiled, as well as their &s;yrup and &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Both the men and women chew betle and areca, mixed with a &s;ort of lime, compo&s;ed of &s;hells and coral &s;tones; and as they fre|quently add tobacco to the other ingredients, and acquire this di&s;gu&s;tful practice almo&s;t in their infancy, there is not a &s;weet breath, or a &s;ound &s;et of teeth in the whole i&s;land. They &s;ometimes &s;moke tobacco, and the women, par|ticularly, &s;wallow the &s;moke. Their pipes are made of the palm-leaf, about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e quill, and half a foot long, in one end of which they put the tobacco de&s;igned for &s;mok|ing.</P>
<P>The i&s;land con&s;i&s;ts of five divi&s;ions, each of which has a Raja, or chief Governor, of its own. The&s;e divi&s;ions are called TIMO, MASSARA, REGEEUA, LAAI, and SEBA. It was on this la&s;t divi&s;ion that our Engli&s;h adventurers went on &s;hore: the Raja of which was between thirty and forty years of age, and remarkable for his corpulency. He governs his people with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority, but takes on him very little of the parade, or pomp of royalty. The prime mini&s;ter, who has been heretofore men|tioned, appeared to be inve&s;ted with great pow|er, and almo&s;t wholly to direct the actions of the Raja; yet, &s;uch were the abilities and inte|grity of this man, that the people univer&s;ally adored him. When any di&s;pute happens among
<PB N="34" REF="35">
the natives, it is in&s;tantly &s;ettled by the Raja and his coun&s;ellors, in the mo&s;t equitable and &s;atisfactory manner.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this i&s;land depends chiefly on the authority of Mr. Lange, the Dutch factor, who informed Captain Cook, that it was able to rai&s;e &s;even thou&s;and three hundred fighting men, on the &s;horte&s;t notice. The&s;e are armed with lances, &s;pears, mu&s;kets, targets, and pole-axes, which la&s;t are not unlike a wood-bill, only that they are much heavier, and have &s;trait edges. The natives are &s;o expert in the u&s;e of their lances, that they will throw them with &s;uch force and exactne&s;s, as to pierce a man through the heart at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty or &s;eventy yards. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;kill and di&s;po&s;ition for war, it is &s;aid, that the Rajas have lived in the mo&s;t perfect harmony for &s;e|veral ages.</P>
<P>While Captain Cook was on the i&s;land he &s;aw a great gun before the town-hou&s;e, and &s;ome &s;wivels and pateraroes; but the great gun, which was almo&s;t con&s;umed by ru&s;t, lay with the touch-hole to the ground, and the &s;wivels and pate|raroes were not in their carriages. In the town-hou&s;e were a number of &s;pears and targets, of as many different &s;izes as there were weapons; and with the&s;e the natives were armed when they came down with Dr. Solander, with a view to influence the market. The in&s;ides of the mu&s;kets were almo&s;t de&s;troyed by ru&s;t, though
<PB N="35" REF="36">
their out&s;ides were kept clean and bright: the men had very little, if any, powder or ball in their cartridge-boxes; but a piece of paper was put into each hole, as if they had been pro|perly furni&s;hed. It has been already mention|ed, that they marched in the mo&s;t irregular manner; and each man brought with him a lit|tle tobacco, a fowl, or &s;ome other trifle, for &s;ale.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Savu are divided into five ranks; the Rajas, the land-owners, manu|facturers, labourers, and &s;laves. The land-owners are re&s;pected in proportion to the extent of their lands, and the number of their &s;laves, which la&s;t are bought and &s;old with the e&s;tates to which they belong; but when a &s;lave is bought &s;eparately, a fat hog is the price of the purcha&s;e. Though a man may &s;ell his &s;lave in this manner, or convey him with his lands, yet his power over him extends no farther, for he mu&s;t not even &s;trike him without the Raja's permi&s;&s;ion. The e&s;tates of the&s;e land-owners are of very different extent; for &s;ome of them po&s;&s;e&s;s not above five &s;laves, and &s;ome five hun|dred. When a man of rank goes abroad, one of his &s;laves follows him, with a &s;ilver hilted &s;word or hanger, ornamented with hor&s;e hair ta&s;&s;els; while another is furni&s;hed with a little bag, containing tobacco, betle, areca, and lime; and even the Rajas them&s;elves take no farther &s;tate upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">The natives of Savu entertain a veneration for antiquity, &s;uperior, perhaps, to that of any other people in the world. Their principal boa&s;t is a long line of venerable ance&s;tors: the hou&s;es that have been well tenanted for &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive generations are held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem; and even the &s;tones, which are worn &s;mooth by having been &s;at upon for ages, become valua|ble from that very circum&s;tance: the man who&s;e progenitors have bequeathed him any of the&s;e &s;tones, or who&s;e opulence has enabled him to purcha&s;e them, cau&s;es them to be rang|ed round his habitation, for his &s;ervants and &s;laves to &s;it upon.</P>
<P>In the chief town of each di&s;trict the Raja cau&s;es a huge &s;tone to be &s;et up, as a monument of his reign. Thirteen &s;uch &s;tones were &s;een in the province of Seba, and the remains of many others, that have &s;uffered greatly by the wa&s;ting hand of time. The&s;e &s;tones are all placed on the top of a hill, and &s;ome of them are &s;o enormou&s;ly large, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive by what contrivance they could have been placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, nor could any information in this re&s;pect be obtained from the natives. From the&s;e monuments it is evident, that the i&s;land has been regularly governed for a &s;eries of ages pa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the death of a Raja, proclamation is made that all his &s;ubjects &s;hall hold a &s;olemn fe&s;tival; on which they proceed to the hill where the&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="38">
&s;tones are erected, and fea&s;t for &s;everal weeks or months, killing every animal that can be found, to furni&s;h out the treat, which is daily &s;erved upon the monumental &s;tones. When the whole &s;tock is exhau&s;ted, they are compelled to a &s;evere fa&s;t; and when it happens that the fea&s;t ends in the dry &s;ea&s;on, when they cannot get vegetables to eat, they have no other &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance than the palm &s;yrup and water, till the few animals that e&s;cape the general ma&s;&s;acre have bred a &s;ufficient number for a fre&s;h &s;upply; except indeed that the adjacent di&s;tricts may afford &s;ome relief. The natives of Savu have an in&s;trument with which they clear the cotton of its &s;eeds, which is only about &s;even inches in height, and fourteen in length; but is con&s;truc|ted on common mechanical principles. They have likewi&s;e a machine; with which they &s;pin by hand, in the &s;ame manner as the women of England did, before the u&s;e of &s;pinning-wheels was known. The yarn they make is dyed as before-mentioned, and they were once ob&s;erved to be dying &s;ome girdles for the women, of a deep red colour.</P>
<P>The natives in general are robu&s;t and healthy, and had the appearance of being long-lived. The &s;mall-pox has found its way to this i&s;land, and is as much dreaded as the pe&s;tilence: when this di&s;order attacks any per&s;on, he is carried to &s;ome &s;pot at a great di&s;tance from any hou&s;e, where his food is conveyed to him by means
<PB N="38" REF="39">
of a long &s;tick, for no one will venture very near the invalid, who is thus left to take his chance of life or death.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Savu having been vi&s;ited by the Portugue&s;e almo&s;t at their fir&s;t &s;ailing into this part of the world, they e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;et|tlement upon it; but in a little time they were &s;ucceeded by the Dutch, who, though they did not formally po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the i&s;land, &s;ent a number of trading ve&s;&s;els to e&s;tabli&s;h a commerce with the natives. It is thought that the Dutch purcha&s;es are chiefly confined to provi&s;ions for the &s;upply of the Spice I&s;lands, the inhabitants of which, cultivating almo&s;t every &s;pot of ground for the &s;pice trade, breed but a &s;mall number of cattle. A few years ago the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company made an agreement with the &s;everal Rajas of the i&s;land, by which it was covenanted, that a quantity of rice, maize, and calevances &s;hould be annually furni&s;hed to the Dutch, who, in return, &s;upply the Rajas with arrack, cutlery wares, linen, &s;ilk, and &s;ome other things. Small ve&s;&s;els, each of which is manned by ten Indians, are &s;ent from Timor, to bring away the maize and calevances, and a &s;hip which brings the articles which are furni&s;hed by the Dutch, receives the rice on board once a year: and there being three bays on the coa&s;t, this ve&s;&s;el anchors in each of them in its turn. The Rajas accept the Dutch articles of commerce as a pre&s;ent; and
<PB N="39" REF="40">
they and their chief attendants drink ince&s;&s;ant|ly of the arrack till it is all gone. In the agree|ment abovementioned, the Rajas &s;tipulated, that a Dutch re&s;ident &s;hould be con&s;tantly on the i&s;land, to ob&s;erve that their part of the con|tract was fulfilled.</P>
<P>The Dutch having thus concluded the treaty, &s;ent Mr. Lange to act as their re&s;ident, and a kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him, who&s;e father was a Por|tugue&s;e, and his mother a native of Timor, with one Frederick Craig, who&s;e father was a Dutchman, and his mother an Indian. Once every two months Lange is attended by fifty &s;laves on hor&s;e-back, and in this &s;tate vi&s;its each of the Rajas, and, if the crops are ripe, or|ders ve&s;&s;els to convey them immediately to Ti|mor, &s;o that they are not even hou&s;ed on the i&s;land. It is a part of Lange's bu&s;ine&s;s to per|&s;uade the land-owners to plant, if he &s;ees that there has been any neglect on their part. He con&s;tantly takes with him a quantity of arrack, by the help of which he does not fail of making advantageous bargains with the Rajas.</P>
<P>Lange had been on this i&s;land ten years, dur|ing all which time he had not &s;een a white per|&s;on, except tho&s;e who came annually in the Dutch &s;hip to carry off the rice. He is marri|ed to an Indian woman, a native of the i&s;land of Timor, and he lives in the &s;ame manner as the inhabitants of Savu, who&s;e language he &s;peaks better than any other; like them too he
<PB N="40" REF="41">
&s;its on the ground and chews betle, and has &s;o perfectly adopted their manners, that he is an ab&s;olute Indian, except in dre&s;s and complexion.</P>
<P>Mr. Craig is employed in teaching the chil|dren to write and read, and in&s;tructing them in the principles of Chri&s;tianity. The new te&s;ta|ment, a catechi&s;m, and &s;ome other &s;mall books of divinity, have been printed in the language of Savu, and the adjacent i&s;lands, at the ex|pence of the Dutch. Mr. Craig &s;aid, there were &s;ix hundred Chri&s;tians in the town&s;hip of Seba only; yet there is neither a church nor a clergyman throughout the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The religion of &s;uch of the natives of Savu as have not embraced Chri&s;tianity, is a &s;ingular &s;ort of Pagani&s;m, as every man makes choice of his own God, and wor&s;hips him according to his own fancy; &s;o that the variety of Dei|ties, and the methods of adoring them, are &s;carcely fewer than the number of inhabitants. The morality of the&s;e people, however, is of the pure&s;t kind. A robbery is &s;carce ever com|mitted, and a murder is never perpetrated. When any di&s;putes ari&s;e between the natives, they in&s;tantly &s;ubmit the point in debate to the deci&s;ion of the Raja, and re&s;t perfectly &s;atisfied with his determination. No man is permitted to marry more than one wife; yet a violation of the marriage bed, or even the crime of &s;imple fornication, is almo&s;t wholly unknown among them. Happy people! the purity of who&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="42">
morals renders them fit objects of the envy and emulation of the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>Of the i&s;lands in the neighbourhood of Sa|vu, the principal is Timor, which is annually vi&s;ited by the Dutch re&s;idents on the other i&s;lands, in order to make up their accounts. Some of the towns on the north &s;ide of Timor are in the hands of the Portugue&s;e; but the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;s the far greater proportion of the i&s;land, on which they have built a fort, and erected &s;everal &s;tore-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>There are three &s;mall i&s;lands, called the So|lars, which produce a great abundance of the various nece&s;&s;aries of life, that are carried in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to the Dutch &s;ettlement on the i&s;land of Timor: the&s;e i&s;lands are low and flat, and one of them has a commodious harbour.</P>
<P>We&s;tward from the Solars lies the little i&s;land of Ende, which is yet in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e, who have built a con&s;iderable town, called Larntuca, on the north-ea&s;t point of it; and clo&s;e to the town is an harbour where &s;hips may ride in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Rotte has a Dutch re&s;ident on it, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;imilar to that of Mr. Lange on the i&s;land of Savu: Rotte produces, be&s;ides &s;uch things as are common to the other i&s;lands, a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;ugar, which is now made to a great degree of perfection.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a &s;mall i&s;land lying to the we&s;tward of Savu, the chief produce of which
<PB N="42" REF="43">
is areca-nuts, of which the Dutch receive, in exchange for European commodities, as large a quantity every year as will load two ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>A French &s;hip was wrecked on the coa&s;t of Timor, about two years before the Endeavour was in the&s;e &s;eas. She had been lodged on the rock &s;everal days, when the wind tore her to pieces in an in&s;tant, and the Captain, with the greater number of the &s;eamen, were drowned; but a Lieutenant and about eighty men having reached the &s;hore, travelled acro&s;s the country of Concordia, where their immediate nece&s;&s;ities were relieved, after which they returned to the wreck, in company with &s;ome Dutch and In|dians, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in recovering all their che&s;ts of bullion, &s;ome of their guns, and other effects: which being done, they returned to Concordia, where they remained &s;everal weeks; but, in this interval, death made &s;uch havock among them, that not above half their number remained to be &s;ent to their native country, which was done as &s;oon as a ve&s;&s;el could be fit|ted out for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e the account of the i&s;land of Savu, it now only remains to give the following &s;pe|cimen of the language of its inhabitants.</P>

<P>The Endeavour &s;ailed from the i&s;land of Sa|vu on the 21&s;t of September 1770, and bent her cour&s;e we&s;tward. In the afternoon of this day a little flat i&s;land was di&s;covered in 10 de|grees 47 minutes &s;outh latitude, and 238 de|grees
<PB N="45" REF="46">
28 minutes we&s;t longitude, which has not been laid down in any of the charts hitherto publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip got clear of the &s;everal i&s;lands before-mentioned, there was a continual &s;well of the &s;ea from the &s;outh, which Captain Cook imputed to the po&s;ition of the coa&s;t of New South Wales, imagining it to have determined the &s;ea in that direction.</P>
<P>On the 28th they &s;teered north-we&s;t the whole day, in order to get &s;ight of the land of Java; and on the 30th the Captain received from mo&s;t of the officers and &s;eamen their re&s;pective jour|nals of the voyage, regarding which he advi&s;ed them to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy: and he likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the log-book. In the night following there was a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, when the land of Java was &s;een to the ea&s;tward by the brightne&s;s of the lightning. In the morning they had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Cracatoa, which is &s;ingular for the height of its peak.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 2d of October, when the &s;hip was in fifteen fathom water, &s;he was clo&s;e in with the coa&s;t of Java, along which they now &s;teered. As their faithful Indian friend Tupia was at this time extremely ill, the Captain di&s;patched a boat to the &s;hore, to en|deavour to bring him &s;ome refre&s;hing fruits, and likewi&s;e to procure gra&s;s for the buffaloes. As &s;oon as the boat landed, the inhabitants a&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the &s;eamen in cutting gra&s;s for the cattle, and in gathering a bunch of plantains and a few co|coa-nuts, for which they received a &s;hilling, and which were brought off to the &s;hip. The land of Java had a delightful appearance, being every where well covered with trees.</P>
<P>This day they had &s;ight of two Dutch ve&s;&s;els, and an officer being di&s;patched to one of them, to learn any intere&s;ting intelligence, he brought word back, that the Swallow had reached the Engli&s;h channel in &s;afety, that di&s;putes were carried to great lengths at home, in regard to the mini&s;ters, and in America, on account of taxes; and that the Ru&s;&s;ians, Poles and Turks, were embroiled in a war. The officer &s;aid, that the ve&s;&s;els were Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen, bound from Batavia, one of them to the coa&s;t of Ma|labar, and the other to the i&s;land of Ceylon: he &s;aid likewi&s;e, that there was a kind of packet-boat, which he had been told, was appointed to carry letters from &s;uch Dutch &s;hips as came thither to Batavia; but Captain Cook conjec|tured, that her bu&s;ine&s;s was to examine &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hould pa&s;s the Streight.</P>
<P>The &s;hip had now been &s;ome hours at an|chor; but a light breeze &s;pringing up in the evening, they got under &s;ail, and continued to proceed at a &s;low rate during the night. On the 3d, in the morning, the Dutch packet-boat was ob&s;erved &s;ailing after the Endeavour; but &s;he bore away again on the &s;hifting of the wind.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">This changing of the wind obliging the En|deavour to come to an anchor, the ma&s;ter of the packet-boat came along-&s;ide of her, in one of the boats belonging to the country, bringing with him rice-birds, monkies, parrots, parro|quets, ducks, fowls, turtle, and other things, with an intention to &s;ell them; but as the &s;tock which had been laid in at Savu was not yet con|&s;umed, and he had fixed very high prices on his commodities, very few articles were pur|cha&s;ed: the Captain, however, bought twenty or thirty fowls, and a &s;mall turtle.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the packet-boat had brought with him two books, in one of which he wrote down the Captain's name, and that of the ve&s;|&s;el, to be &s;ent to the Governor and Council of the Indies; and in the other book he reque&s;ted that &s;ome of the gentlemen on board would likewi&s;e write down the name of the ve&s;&s;el, with that of the Captain; where &s;he came from, to what port &s;he was bound, and as many particu|lars re&s;pecting any per&s;on on board, as them|&s;elves might think nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;atisfy the curio|&s;ity of any of their friends who might afterwards enquire for them. In this book many Por|tugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ome of other countries had made entries of the &s;ame kind; but a Lieu|tenant on board the Endeavour having written the &s;hip's name, added only the words, <Q REND="inline">"from Europe;"</Q> yet of this the ma&s;ter of the packet took no other notice, than by &s;aying he was
<PB N="48" REF="49">
content with whatever they were plea&s;ed to write, which was intended &s;olely for the infor|mation of their friends.</P>
<P>They now weighed the anchor, and made repeated attempts to &s;ail; but the wind not blowing &s;o as to enable the ve&s;&s;el to &s;tem the current, &s;he lay to till the morning of the 5th, when a Dutch officer came along-&s;ide the &s;hip, and &s;ent a printed paper to the Captain, in ex|ceeding bad Engli&s;h; the contents of which were to enquire,</P>
<P>1&s;t, The &s;hip's name, and to what nation &s;he belonged?</P>
<P>2d, Whether &s;he came from Europe, or any other place?</P>
<P>3d. What place &s;he had la&s;t departed from?</P>
<P>4th, To what place &s;he was bound?</P>
<P>5th, How many &s;hips belonging to the Dutch Company had been &s;een at the la&s;t coa&s;t the &s;hip had left, and their names?</P>
<P>6th, If one or more of the&s;e &s;hips had been in company with the Endeavour, and was or were &s;ailed for that, or any other place?</P>
<P>7th, If, during the voyage, any thing re|markable had happened, or been &s;een?</P>
<P>8th, If any &s;hips had been &s;een and hailed at &s;ea, or in the &s;treight of Sunda, and what they were?</P>
<P>9th, If they had brought any other news wor|thy of attention, from the place whence the &s;hip took her la&s;t departure; or if any thing
<PB N="49" REF="50">
el&s;e had happened during the voyage, that was worth communicating.</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions were under&s;igned, <Q REND="inline">"Batavia, in the ca&s;tle. By order of the Governor Ge|neral, and the Coun&s;ellors of India, J. BRAN|DER BUNGL, Sec."</Q></P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that the officer had many Other papers of the &s;ame kind, in French, Dutch, and other languages. Captain Cook did not think proper to an&s;wer any of the above que&s;|tions, except the fir&s;t and the fourth. When the Dutchman ob&s;erved this, he &s;aid, that an|&s;wers to the other que&s;tions were not material; yet he &s;eemed to contradict what he had ju&s;t advanced, by &s;aying, that he mu&s;t di&s;patch the paper to Batavia, and that it would reach that place by noon on the following day. This in|cident is particularly recorded, becau&s;e the ex|amining the &s;hips which &s;ail through the &s;treight, is &s;aid to be a piece of Dutch policy of very modern date.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Dutch officer was departed, the anchor was weighed; but the &s;hip was obliged to come to an anchor again in about four hours, for want of wind to enable her properly to &s;tem the current. A breeze &s;oon &s;pringing up, the ve&s;&s;el held on her way till the following morning, when &s;he was again obliged to be brought to an anchor, owing to the rapidity of the current. This day and the next they weighed the anchor, and brought to &s;everal
<PB N="50" REF="51">
times. On the 8th they weighed, and &s;tood clear of a large ledge of rocks, which they had been near running fowl of the preceding day; but before noon this day they were once more obliged to anchor near a little i&s;land, which was not laid down in any chart that they had on board. It is one of tho&s;e that bear the name of the Milles i&s;les; and Me&s;&s;rs. So|lander and Banks having landed upon it, col|lected a few plants, and &s;hot a bat which was a yard long, being mea&s;ured from the extreme points of the wings; they al&s;o killed a few plovers, in all re&s;pects like the Engli&s;h golden plover. On this i&s;land, the breadth of which does not exceed one hundred yards, and the length five hundred, they found a hou&s;e, and a little &s;pot of cultivated ground, and on it grew the <HI>Palma Chri&s;ti,</HI> from which the We&s;t Indians make the ca&s;tor oil.</P>
<P>In a little time after the gentlemen came back to the &s;hip, &s;ome Malays came along|&s;ide, in a boat, bringing with them &s;ome pumpkins, dried fi&s;h, and turtle for &s;ale: one of the turtles, which weighed near one hundred and fifty pounds, they &s;old for a dollar, and &s;eemed to expect the &s;ame piece of money for their pumpkins; but it being hinted to them that a dollar was too much, they de&s;ired that one might be cut, and a piece of it given to them: but this not being complied with, they at length &s;old &s;ix and twenty pumpkins for a
<PB N="51" REF="52">
Portugue&s;e petacka. When they departed they intimated their wi&s;hes, that this tran&s;action might not be mentioned at Batavia.</P>
<P>The &s;hip now made but &s;low way till night, when the land breeze &s;pringing up, they &s;ailed to the ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, and on the following day, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ea breeze, they came to an anchor in the road of Batavia. At this place they found a number of large Dutch ve&s;&s;els, the Harcourt Ea&s;t Indiaman from Eng|land, which had lo&s;t her pa&s;&s;age to China, and two &s;hips belonging to the private trade of our India Company.</P>
<P>The Endeavour had no &s;ooner anchored, than a &s;hip was ob&s;erved, with a broad pendant flying, from which a boat was di&s;patched to demand the name of the ve&s;&s;el, with that of the Commander, &amp;c. To the&s;e enquiries Cap|tain Cook gave &s;uch an&s;wers as he thought proper, and the officer who commanded the boat departed. This gentleman and the crew that attended him were &s;o worn down by the un|healthine&s;s of the climate, that they appeared but as the &s;hadows of men; which the Captain deemed a &s;ad pre&s;age of the havock which death would &s;oon make among his crew; yet at pre|&s;ent there was not one invalid on board, except the Indian Tupia: the Engli&s;h tars, who&s;e want of fore&s;ight and defiance of danger is notorious, &s;eemed not to entertain the lea&s;t idea that even &s;ickne&s;s would attack a &s;et of men &s;o hardened
<PB N="52" REF="53">
as they were by different climates; but alas&punc; they had very little idea of the fatal contagion which impregnates the air of Batavia.</P>
<P>The Captain now di&s;patched an officer to the Governor of the town, to apologize for the En|deavour's not &s;aluting; for he had but three guns proper for the purpo&s;e, except &s;wivels, and he was apprehen&s;ive that they would not be heard.</P>
<P>The &s;hip was at this time &s;o leaky, that &s;he made about nine inches water an hour, on the average; part of her fal&s;e keel was gone; one of her pumps was totally u&s;ele&s;s, and the re&s;t &s;o very much decayed, that they could not la&s;t long. The officers and &s;eamen concurring in opinion, that the &s;hip could not &s;afely put to &s;ea again in this condition, the Captain re&s;olved to &s;olicit permi&s;&s;ion to heave her down; but as he had learnt that this mu&s;t be done in writing, he drew up a petition, and had it tran&s;lated in|to Dutch.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 10th of October 1770, the Captain and the re&s;t of the gentlemen went on &s;hore, and applied to the only Engli&s;h gen|tleman then re&s;ident at Batavia: this gentleman, who&s;e name was Leith, received his country|men in the polite&s;t manner, and entertained them at dinner with great ho&s;pitality. Mr. Leith informed them, that a public hotel was kept in the town, by order of the Dutch go|vernment, at which place merchants and other
<PB N="53" REF="54">
&s;trangers were obliged to lodge, and that the landlord of the hotel was bound to find them warehou&s;es for their goods, on the condition of his receiving ten &s;hillings on every hundred pounds of their value; but that as the Endea|vour was a King's &s;hip, her officers, and the other gentlemen, might re&s;ide where they thought proper, only a&s;king leave of the Go|vernor, who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion would be in&s;tantly obtained. Mr. Leith added, that they might live cheaper in this way than at the hotel, if they had any per&s;on who &s;poke the Malay tongue, on whom they could rely in the pur|cha&s;e of their provi&s;ions: but as there was no &s;uch per&s;on among the whole &s;hip's crew, the gentlemen immediately be&s;poke beds at the hotel.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Captain Cook attended the Governor General, who received him politely, and told him to wait on the Council the next morning, when his petition &s;hould be laid be|fore them, and every thing he &s;olicited would be readily granted.</P>
<P>Late in the evening of this day there happen|ed a mo&s;t terrible &s;torm of thunder and light|ning, accompanied with very heavy rain. In this &s;torm the main-ma&s;t of a Dutch Ea&s;t In|diaman was &s;plit and carried away by the deck; and the main-top-ma&s;t and top-gallant-ma&s;t were torn to pieces; it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the lightning was attracted by an iron &s;pindle at the main-top-gallant-ma&s;t-head. The Endeavour,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
which was at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the Dutch &s;hip, e&s;caped without damage, owing, in Cap|tain Cook's opinion, to an electrical chain, which conducted the lightning over the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el: and he recommends chains of the &s;ame kind to be taken on board all &s;hips, to whatever part of the globe they may be bound. A centinel on board the Endeavour, who was charging his mu&s;ket at the time of the &s;torm, had it &s;haken out of his hand, and the rammer-rod was broken in pieces: the electrical chain looked like a &s;tream of fire, and the &s;hip &s;u&s;|tained a very violent &s;hock.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 11th Captain Cook waited on the gentlemen of the Council, who informed him, that all his reque&s;ts &s;hould be complied with. In the interim, the other gentlemen made a contract with the ma&s;ter of the hotel, to furni&s;h them and their friends with as much tea, coffee, punch and tobacco, as they might have occa&s;ion for, and to keep them a &s;eparate table, for nine &s;hillings a day, Engli&s;h money; but on the condition that every per&s;on who &s;hould vi&s;it them, &s;hould pay at the rate of four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence for his dinner, and the &s;ame &s;um for his &s;upper and bed, if he cho&s;e to &s;leep at the hotel: they were likewi&s;e to pay for every &s;ervant that attended them fifteen pence a day.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon di&s;covered, that they had been vilely impo&s;ed on; for the&s;e charges were above
<PB N="55" REF="56">
twice as much as would have been demanded at a private hou&s;e. They appeared to live ele|gantly, but at the &s;ame time were but ill &s;up|plied. Their dinner con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen di&s;hes, all &s;erved up at once; and their &s;upper of thir|teen; but of the&s;e, nine or ten were of the mo&s;t ordinary, becau&s;e the cheape&s;t, poultry, that could be purcha&s;ed; and even &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;hes were ob&s;erved to be &s;erved up four times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: a duck, which was hot at dinner, was brought cold in the evening; the next day it appeared in the form of a frica&s;ee, and was converted to forced meat at night. Our countrymen, however, only fared as others had done before them: it was the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of the con&s;cientious ma&s;ter of the hotel, to treat all his gue&s;ts in the &s;ame manner, when they fir&s;t took up their re&s;idence at his hou&s;e: if they took no notice of it, all was well, for the landlord had the better cu&s;tomers of them; if they remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch treatment, the table was better and better &s;upplied from time to time, till, in the end, they had no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>The gentlemen having found fault with their fare, were afterwards &s;upplied in a better man|ner; but Mr. Banks, not approving the con|duct of the ma&s;ter of the hotel, he hired lodg|ings for him&s;elf and his attendants at the ad|joining hou&s;e, for which he agreed to pay five and forty &s;hillings a month: but here Mr.
<PB N="56" REF="57">
Banks was di&s;appointed in the hope he had formed of living retired; for &s;carce a Dutch man had occa&s;ion to pa&s;s by the hou&s;e, but he ran in without ceremony, to enquire what was to be &s;old; for it is a very unu&s;ual thing at Ba|tavia, for &s;trangers who are in a private capa|city not to be furni&s;hed with &s;ome articles of traffick. In this hou&s;e no per&s;on was permitted to &s;leep, as a gue&s;t of Mr. Banks, without his bed being &s;eparately paid for. It is the univer|&s;al cu&s;tom here to hire a carriage; and Mr. Banks engaged two, for which he paid eighteen &s;hillings a day: the&s;e carriages are open chai&s;es, in which two per&s;ons &s;it commodiou&s;ly, and are driven by a man &s;itting on a kind of coach-box.</P>
<P>Their Indian friend Tupia had been till this time on board very dangerou&s;ly ill, yet per&s;i&s;t|ed to refu&s;e every medicine that was offered him: Mr. Banks now &s;ent for him to his hou&s;e, in the hope that he might recover his health. While he was in the &s;hip, and even after he was put into the boat, he was indi&s;po&s;ed, and low &s;pirited, in the utmo&s;t degree; but the mo|ment he came into the town, his whole frame appeared as if re-animated. The hou&s;es, the carriages, the people, and many other objects, were totally new to him; and a&s;toni&s;hment took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his features at &s;ights &s;o wonderful: but if Tupia was a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;cene, his boy, Tayota, was perfectly enraptured, danc|ing along the &s;treets in an extacy of joy, and
<PB N="57" REF="58">
examining the &s;everal objects as they pre&s;ented them&s;elves, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t inqui&s;itive|ne&s;s and curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Of all the circum&s;tances which engaged the attention of Tupia, nothing &s;truck him &s;o much as the va&s;t variety of dre&s;&s;es worn by the inha|bitants of Batavia: he enquired the rea&s;on of what appeared &s;o very extraordinary in his eyes, and being informed that the people were of a variety of nations, and that all were dre&s;&s;ed according to the mode of their own country, he reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to follow the fa&s;hion: this reque&s;t being readily complied with, a per&s;on was di&s;patched to the &s;hip for &s;ome South Sea cloth, with which he &s;oon clothed him&s;elf in the dre&s;s of the inhabitants of Otaheite. The people of Batavia, who had &s;een an Indian, brought thither in M. Bougainville's &s;hip, named Otourou, mi&s;took Tupia for that man, and frequently enquired if he was not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the &s;hip were to be made at Ouru&s;t, Captain Cook obtained an order to the &s;uperintendant of that i&s;land to receive her; and he wrote to the Secretary of the Admiralty, an account of the &s;afe arrival of the Endeavour in the road of Batavia, and di&s;|patched his letter by a Dutch &s;hip that was bound to Europe.</P>
<P>Captain Cook now applied to &s;everal per&s;ons to advance him money &s;ufficient to defray the
<PB N="58" REF="59">
expence of repairing the &s;hip; but not one could be found in the whole town who had the requi&s;ite &s;um in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or, if he had, was willing to advance it: he therefore made application to the Governor, who i&s;&s;ued his or|ders, that he &s;hould be &s;upplied out of the trea|&s;ury of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 18th of Octo|ber 1770, the &s;hip got under &s;ail, and proceed|ed to Ouru&s;t; and, in a day or two, the crew began to take out her &s;tores, which were depo|&s;ited in the wharf on Cooper's I&s;land; but this bu&s;ine&s;s was rendered unavoidably tedious, by &s;everal Dutch &s;hips being at the &s;ame wharf, taking in their ladings of pepper.</P>
<P>After little more than a week &s;pent at Ba|tavia, the ill effects of the climate began to be &s;everely felt. Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks were indi&s;po&s;ed with fevers; Mr. Banks's two &s;ervants were exceedingly ill; the Indian boy, Tayota, had an inflammation on his lungs; and Tupia was &s;o bad, that his life was de&s;paired of. Their indi&s;po&s;ition was attributed partly to the heat of the climate, and partly to the &s;wampy &s;ituation of the town, and the &s;tench of the dirty canals with which it abounds.</P>
<P>By the 26th of the month, very few of the crew were well enough to do duty; and on this day a tent was erected for their reception. Tu|pia now reque&s;ted to be conveyed to the &s;hip, in the hope of breathing a purer air than in the
<PB N="59" REF="60">
town; but his reque&s;t could not be granted, as &s;he was unrigged, and preparations were mak|ing to lay her down, in order that &s;he might undergo a thorough repair: on the 28th, how|ever, Mr. Banks attended Tupia to Cooper's I&s;land, where a tent was pitched for him, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, where he was alternately refre&s;hed by the land and &s;ea breezes; and the poor crea|ture was extremely thankful that he was &s;o agreeably lodged. By this time the Surgeon was &s;o ill, that he could not leave his bed; Mr. Banks's fever was greatly encrea&s;ed, and Dr. So|lander grew wor&s;e every day.</P>
<P>The &s;hip was at length laid down on the 5th of November, on which day died Mr. Monk|hou&s;e, the Surgeon, who&s;e lo&s;s was the more &s;everely felt, as he was a man of &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, and fell a &s;acrifice to the pe&s;tiferous air of the country, at a time when his abilities were mo&s;t wanted. Dr. Solander, though ex|tremely ill, had &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;ee his re|mains committed to the ground, but Mr. Banks was unable even to pay this la&s;t &s;ad duty to a worthy man.</P>
<P>Death now advanced with ha&s;ty &s;trides among our adventrous countrymen, who were equally unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, or &s;hun his embraces. Several Malay &s;ervants were engaged, to wait on tho&s;e who were ill; but the&s;e people were &s;o remi&s;s in their duty, that it was no uncom|mon thing for the &s;ick man to leave his bed in
<PB N="60" REF="61">
&s;earch of his attendant. The Indian boy, Tayota, paid the debt of Nature on the 9th of this month, and Tupia, who&s;e tender affection for the youth can be equalled only by that of a parent for a favourite child, was &s;o &s;hocked at the lo&s;s, that it was evident he could not long &s;urvive him.</P>
<P>By this time the &s;hip's bottom having been carefully &s;urveyed, our countrymen had ample rea&s;on to be grateful to that Providence, by which they had been pre&s;erved during a pa&s;&s;age of &s;e|veral hundred miles, through the mo&s;t danger|ous &s;eas on the face of the globe: for the &s;heath|ing in &s;everal places was torn from the ve&s;&s;el, the fal&s;e keel was in a great mea&s;ure gone, the main keel was damaged in many parts, &s;everal of the planks had received great injury, and a part of three of them was thinner than the &s;ole of a &s;hoe!</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;is. Solander and Banks were now &s;o worn down by their di&s;orders, that the Phy&s;ician, who attended them, recommended the country air, as the only thing that could po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore them to the wi&s;hes of their friends. In con&s;e|quence of this advice, they hired a country-hou&s;e of the ma&s;ter of the hotel, who engaged to &s;upply them with &s;laves, and to furni&s;h their table; but as they had &s;ufficiently experienced the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e &s;laves, they bought two Malay women, who &s;oon became excellent nur&s;es, from that tenderne&s;s of Nature which
<PB N="61" REF="62">
does &s;o much honour to the &s;ex. While the&s;e gentlemen were taking mea&s;ures for the reco|very of their health, poor Tupia fell a victim to the ravages of his di&s;order, and to his grief for the decea&s;ed Tayota. When Tayota was fir&s;t &s;eized with the fatal di&s;order, he &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of his approaching end, and frequently &s;aid to tho&s;e that were about him, Tyau mate &s;ee, <Q REND="inline">"My friends, I am dying:"</Q> he was very tractable, and took any medicines that were of|fered to him; they were both buried in the i&s;land of Edam.</P>
<P>Captain Cook be&s;tows great encomiums on the officers and workmen of the Marine Yard at Ouru&s;t, by who&s;e &s;kill and diligence the bot|tom of the &s;hip was perfectly repaired by the 14th of the month; and he warmly recom|mends the heaving down with two ma&s;ts, in|&s;tead of one, which, he &s;ays, is undoubtedly the more expeditious, as well as the &s;afer me|thod.</P>
<P>By this time not above ten men, out of the whole &s;hip's crew, were able to do duty, and the&s;e were employed in getting the water and &s;tores aboard, and in putting up the rigging: the water was purcha&s;ed at Batavia, at the rate of one hundred and fifty gallons for &s;ix &s;hil|lings and eight pence.</P>
<P>Captain Cook was now taken ill, and Mr. Sporing and a &s;ailor, who attended Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander at their country-hou&s;e, were
<PB N="62" REF="63">
attacked with intermitting fevers; but tho&s;e two gentlemen grew &s;omething better, though their recovery was very &s;low. Their hou&s;e was &s;ituated on the borders of a rivulet, which, of cour&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the circulation of the air; and it was likewi&s;e open to the &s;ea breeze.</P>
<P>In the night of the 25th there fell &s;uch a &s;hower of rain, for the &s;pace of four hours, as even our voyagers had &s;carce ever remembered. The water poured through every part of Mr. Banks's hou&s;e; and the lower apartments ad|mitted a &s;tream &s;ufficient to have turned a mill. As this gentleman was now greatly re&s;tored in health, he went to Batavia the following day, and was &s;urprized to &s;ee, that the inhabitants had hung out their bedding to dry. The we&s;|terly mon&s;oon &s;et in about the 26th of this month: it blows in the day-time from the north, or north-we&s;t, and from the &s;outh-we&s;t during the night: previous to this, there had been violent thunder, and hard &s;howers of rain for &s;everal nights.</P>
<P>The mu&s;quitos and gnats, who&s;e company had been &s;ufficiently di&s;agreeable in the dry wea|ther, now began to &s;warm in immen&s;e numbers, ri&s;ing from the puddles of water like bees from a hive: they were extremely trouble&s;ome during the night, but the pain ari&s;ing from their &s;ting, though very &s;evere, &s;eldom la&s;ted more than half an hour; and in the day-time they &s;eldom made their attacks. The frogs kept a perpe|tual
<PB N="63" REF="64">
croaking in the ditches; a certain &s;ign that the wet &s;ea&s;on was commenced, and that daily rain might be expected.</P>
<P>The &s;hip being repaired, the &s;ick people be|ing received on board her, and the greater part of her water and &s;tores taken in, &s;he &s;ailed from Ouru&s;t on the 8th of December, and anchored in the road of Batavia. Twelve days were em|ployed in receiving the remainder of her pro|vi&s;ions, water, and other nece&s;&s;aries; though this bu&s;ine&s;s would have been done in much le&s;s time, but that &s;ome of the crew died, and the majority of the &s;urvivors were &s;o ill, as to be unable to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 24th Captain Cook took leave of the Governor, and &s;ome other gentlemen, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the civilities they &s;hewed him: but at this juncture an incident occurred, that might have produced con&s;e|quences by no means de&s;irable. A &s;ailor be|longing to one of the Dutch &s;hips in the road of Batavia, de&s;erted from that ve&s;&s;el, and en|tered him&s;elf on board the Endeavour. The Captain of the Dutch &s;hip having made appli|cation to the Governor, claiming the delin|quent as a &s;ubject of the States General, the Governor i&s;&s;ued his order for the re&s;toration of the man: Captain Cook had but ju&s;t taken a formal leave of the Governor when this order was delivered to him; and he &s;aid, that the man &s;hould be given up, if it appeared that he
<PB N="64" REF="65">
was a Dutchman. As the Captain was at this time on &s;hore, and did not intend going on board till the following day, he gave the Dutch officer a note to the Lieutenant, who command|ed on board the Endeavour, to deliver the de|&s;erter on the condition above-mentioned. On the following day the Dutchman waited on Cap|tain Cook, informing him, that the Lieutenant had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give up the &s;eaman, &s;aying, that he was an Iri&s;hman, and of cour&s;e a &s;ubject of his Britannick Maje&s;ty. Captain Cook applauded the conduct of his officer, and added, that it could not be expected, that he &s;hould deliver up an Engli&s;h &s;ubject. The Dutch officer then &s;aid, he was authorized, by the Governor, to demand the fugitive as a Da|ni&s;h &s;ubject, adding, that his name was entered in the &s;hip's books, as having been born at El|&s;ineur: to this Captain Cook very properly re|plied, that the Governor mu&s;t have been mi&s;|taken, when he gave this order for delivering the de&s;erter, who had his option whether he would &s;erve the Dutch or the Engli&s;h; but that in compliment to the Governor, the man &s;hould be given up, as a favour, if he appear|ed to be a Dane; but that, in this ca&s;e, he &s;hould by no means be demanded as a right, and that he would certainly keep him, if he appeared to be a &s;ubject of the crown of Great Britain. The Dutchman now took his leave, and he had not been long gone, before the
<PB N="65" REF="66">
Captain received a letter from the commanding officer on board, containing full proof, that the man was an Engli&s;h &s;ubject. This letter the Captain carried to the Shebander, de&s;iring him to lay it before the Governor, and to inform him, that the man &s;hould not be delivered up on any terms whatever. This &s;pirited conduct on the part of Captain Cook had the proper ef|fect; and thus the matter ended.</P>
<P>This day the Captain, attended by Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen who had hitherto lived in the town, repaired on board the &s;hip, which got under &s;ail the next morning. The Endea|vour was &s;aluted by the fort, and by the Elgin Ea&s;t Indiaman, which then lay in the road; but &s;oon after the&s;e compliments were returned, the &s;ea breeze &s;etting in, they were obliged to come to an anchor. Since the arrival of the &s;hip in Batavia road, every per&s;on belonging to her had been ill, except the &s;ail-maker, who was more than &s;eventy years old, yet this man got drunk every day while they remained there. The Endeavour buried &s;even of her people at Batavia, viz. Tupia and his boy, three of the &s;ailors, the &s;ervant of Mr. Green, the a&s;trono|mer, and the Surgeon: and at the time of the ve&s;&s;el's &s;ailing, forty of the crew were &s;ick, and the re&s;t &s;o enfeebled by their late illne&s;s, as to be &s;carcely able to do their duty.</P>
<P>The town of Batavia is &s;ituated in &s;ix degrees ten minutes &s;outh latitude, and one hundred
<PB N="66" REF="67">
and &s;ix degrees fifty minutes ea&s;t longitude, from the meridian of Greenwich. It is built on the bank of a large bay, &s;omething more than twenty miles from the Streight of Sunda, on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land of Java, in low boggy ground. Several &s;mall rivers, which ri&s;e forty miles up the country, in the moun|tains of Blaeuwen Berg, di&s;charge them&s;elves into the &s;ea at this place, having fir&s;t inter&s;ect|ed the town in different directions. There are wide canals of nearly &s;tagnated water in almo&s;t every &s;treet, and as the banks of the&s;e canals are planted with rows of trees, the effect is very agreeable; but the&s;e trees and canals combine to render the air pe&s;tilential. Some of the ri|vers are navigable, more than thirty miles up the country; and, indeed, the Dutch appear to have cho&s;en this &s;pot to build the town on, for the &s;ake of water-carriage, in which conve|nience Batavia exceeds every place in the world, except the towns of Holland.</P>
<P>A writer, who publi&s;hed an account of this place near fifty years ago, makes the number of hou&s;es at that time 4760, viz. 1242 Dutch hou&s;es, and 1200 Chine&s;e hou&s;es, within the walls; and 1066 Dutch hou&s;es, and 1240 Chine&s;e hou&s;es, without the walls, with twelve hou&s;es for the vending of arrack. The &s;treets of Batavia being wide, and the hou&s;es large, it &s;tands on more ground than any other place that has only an equal number of hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">In dry weather a mo&s;t horrid &s;tench ari&s;es from the canals, and taint the air to a great de|gree; and when the rains have &s;o &s;welled the canals that they overflow their banks, the ground-floors of the hou&s;es, in the lower parts of the town, are filled with &s;tinking water, that leaves behind it dirt and &s;lime in amazing quantities. The running &s;treams are &s;ometimes as offen&s;ive as the &s;tagnant canals; for the bodies of dead animals are frequently lodged on the &s;hallow parts, where they are left to putrify, and cor|rupt the air, except a flood happens to carry them away: this was the ca&s;e with a dead buf|faloe, while the crew of the Endeavour were there, which lay &s;tinking on the &s;hoal of a ri|ver, in one of the chief &s;treets, for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>They &s;ometimes clean the canals; but this bu&s;ine&s;s is performed in &s;uch a manner, as &s;carcely to make them le&s;s a nui&s;ance than be|fore; for the bottom being cleared of its black mud, it is left on the &s;ide of the canal till it is hard enough to be taken away in boats; and as there are no hou&s;es for nece&s;&s;ary retirement in the whole town, the filth is thrown into the canals regularly once a day, &s;o that this mud is a compound of every thing that can be imagin|ed di&s;agreeable and offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>There is a new church in Batavia, which is a fine piece of building, and the dome of it may be &s;een far off at &s;ea. This church is il|luminated
<PB N="68" REF="69">
by chandeliers of the mo&s;t &s;uperb workman&s;hip, and has a fine organ: mo&s;t of the other public buildings are ancient, con|&s;tructed in an ill ta&s;te, and give a very compleat idea of Dutch clum&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Their method of building their hou&s;es &s;eems to have been taught them by the climate. On the ground-floor there is no room but a large hall, a corner of which is parted off for the tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s: the hall has two doors, which are commonly left open, and are oppo|&s;ite each other, &s;o that the air pa&s;&s;es freely through the room, in the middle of which there is a court, which at once encrea&s;es the draft of air, and affords light to the hall: the &s;tairs, which are at one corner, lead to large and lofty apartments above. The female &s;laves are not permitted to &s;it in any place, but in the alcove formed by the court; and this is the u&s;ual din|ing-place of the family.</P>
<P>The town of Batavia is encompa&s;&s;ed by a ri|ver of &s;hallow water, the &s;tream of which is very rapid: within this river, which is of dif|ferent widths in various places, is an old &s;tone&punc; wall, much decayed in many places, and within the wall is a canal that is likewi&s;e much wider in &s;ome places than in others: &s;o that there is no entering the gates of the town but by cro&s;&s;ing two draw-bridges: there are but few guns on the ramparts, and no per&s;ons are permitted to walk there. There is a kind of citadel, or
<PB N="69" REF="70">
ca&s;tle, in the north-ea&s;t corner of the town, the walls of which are both broader and higher than they are in other parts; it is furni&s;hed with a number of large guns, which command the landing-place.</P>
<P>Apartments are provided in this ca&s;tle for the Governor General and all the Council; and in ca&s;e of a &s;iege they have orders to retire thither.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;tle are likewi&s;e a number of &s;tore|hou&s;es, in which the effects belonging to the Company are depo&s;ited. The Company have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion large quantities of gun-pow|der, which is kept in different places, that the lightning may not de&s;troy the whole &s;tock at once; a great number of cannon are likewi&s;e laid up within the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>There are a great many forts built in different parts of the country, &s;everal miles di&s;|tant from Batavia, mo&s;t probably erected to keep the natives in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and be&s;ides the&s;e there are a number of fortified hou&s;es, each mounting eight guns, and the&s;e are &s;o &s;tationed as to command the canals, and the roads on their borders. There are hou&s;es of this kind in many parts of the i&s;land of Java, and the other i&s;lands in its neighbourhood, of which the Dutch have obtained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion The Chi|ne&s;e having rebelled again&s;t the Dutch in the year 1740, all their principal hou&s;es were de|moli&s;hed by the cannon of one of the&s;e forti|fied
<PB N="70" REF="71">
hou&s;es, which is in the town of Batavia, where, likewi&s;e, there are a few more of them.</P>
<P>The roads of this country are &s;imply banks between the ditches and canals; and the forti|fied hou&s;es being erected among the mora&s;&s;es near the&s;e roads, nothing is ea&s;ier than to de&s;troy them, and con&s;equently to prevent an enemy from bringing any heavy artillery near the town; if, indeed, an enemy be only hindered a &s;hort time in his approach, he is effectually ruined, for the climate will preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of the u&s;e of weapons for his de&s;truction. Before the Endeavour had been a week at Batavia they began to feel the ill effects of the climate; half the crew were rendered incapable of doing their duty before the expiration of a month. They were informed, that it was a very uncom|mon thing for fifty &s;oldiers, out of a hundred brought from Europe, to be alive at the expi|ration of the fir&s;t year, and that of the fifty who might happen to be alive, not ten of tho&s;e would be in &s;ound health, and, probably, not le&s;s than half of them in the ho&s;pital. One would imagine that no man of common &s;en&s;e would be tempted to re&s;ide at Batavia, for any con&s;ideration of intere&s;t whatever; yet &s;uch is the in&s;atiable thir&s;t of gold, that men will vo|luntarily r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;k the lo&s;s of life to obtain it, and even en&s;ure the lo&s;s of that health, without which the mo&s;t &s;plendid fortune cannot be en|joyed.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">All the white inhabitants of Batavia are &s;ol|diers, and, at the expiration of five years &s;er|vice, they are bound to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to go to war, if they &s;hould be wanted; and the younger inhabitants are frequently mu&s;|tered; but as they are neither trained nor exer|ci&s;ed after the expiration of the five years above|mentioned, the little they have learnt is &s;oon forgotten, and they would probably, if called to action, make as <HI>good &s;oldiers as the militia of the city of London.</HI> The Portugue&s;e, who live in this country, employ them&s;elves very much in &s;hooting the deer, and the wild hog, whence they become excellent mark&s;men. The Indians, of whatever nation, who re&s;ide here, and have either been made free, or were born &s;o, are called Mardykers; but neither the&s;e nor the Chine&s;e are acquainted with the u&s;e of fire-arms; yet, as the&s;e people are &s;aid to po&s;|&s;e&s;s great per&s;onal bravery, much might be ex|pected from their expert u&s;e of their daggers, &s;words and lances.</P>
<P>From what has been above written it is evi|dent, that it would be a laborious ta&s;k to attack Batavia by land; and it is not po&s;&s;ible to make any attack at all by &s;ea, for the &s;hallowne&s;s of the water would hinder any ve&s;&s;els from ad|vancing within cannon &s;hot of the walls; indeed there is barely depth of water for a &s;hip's long|boat, excepting a narrow channel, called the river, which extends about half a mile into the
<PB N="72" REF="73">
harbour, and is &s;trongly bounded on each &s;ide with piers; the other end of it being directly under the fire of the ca&s;tle; while its commu|nication with the canals of the town is prevented by a boom of wood, which is every night &s;hut preci&s;ely at &s;ix o'clock, and never opened till the following day.</P>
<P>Any number of &s;hips may anchor in the har|bour of Batavia, the ground of which is &s;o excellent, that the anchor will never quit its hold. This harbour is &s;ometimes dangerous for boats, when the &s;ea breeze blows fre&s;h; but, upon the whole, it is deemed the be&s;t and mo&s;t commodious in all India.</P>
<P>There are a con&s;iderable number of i&s;lands which are &s;ituated round the out&s;ide of the harbour, and all the&s;e are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch, who de&s;tine them to different pur|po&s;es. On one of them, which is called Pur|merent, an ho&s;pital is erected, on account of the air being purer than it is at Batavia. In a &s;econd, the name of which is Kuyper, are erected a number of warehou&s;es, in which are lodged the rice, and &s;ome other commodities, the property of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company: at this i&s;land tho&s;e &s;hips belonging to different nations, which are to be repaired at Ouru&s;t, unlade their cargoes; and it was here that the &s;tores of the Falmouth Man of War were laid up, when &s;he was condemned, on her return from Manilla; her warrant officers, of whom
<PB N="73" REF="74">
mention has been made in the account of Cap|tain Wallis's voyage, were &s;ent to Europe in Dutch &s;hips, about half a year before the En|deavour anchored in the road of Batavia. A third of the&s;e i&s;lands, the name of which is Edam, is appropriated to the reception of &s;uch offenders, who&s;e crimes are not deemed worthy of death, and hither they are tran&s;ported from Holland, and detained from five to forty years, in proportion to the turpitude of the offence they have committed; the making of ropes is the principal part of the employment of the&s;e criminals.</P>
<P>The environs of Batavia have a very plea&s;ing appearance, and would, in almo&s;t any other coun|try, be an enviable &s;ituation. Gardens and hou&s;es occupy the country for &s;everal miles; but the gardens are &s;o covered with trees, that the ad|vantage of the land having been cleared of the wood that originally covered it, is almo&s;t wholly lo&s;t; while the&s;e gardens, and the fields adjacent to them are &s;urrounded by ditches which yield not the mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell; and the bogs and mora&s;&s;es in the adjacent fields are &s;till more offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>For the &s;pace of more than thirty miles be|yond the town the land is totally flat, except in two places, on one of which the Governor's country-&s;eat is built, and on the other they hold a large market; but neither of the&s;e places are higher than ten yards from the level of the
<PB N="74" REF="75">
plain. At near forty miles from the town, the land ri&s;es into hills, and the air is purified in a great degree; to this di&s;tance the invalids are &s;ent by their phy&s;icians, when every other pro&s;|pect of their recovery has failed, and the ex|periment &s;ucceeds in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, for the &s;ick are &s;oon re&s;tored to health; but they no &s;ooner return to the town, than their former di&s;orders vi&s;it them. On the&s;e hills the mo&s;t opulent of the inhabitants have country|&s;eats, to which they pay an annual vi&s;it. Tho&s;e who re&s;ide con&s;tantly on the hills enjoy an al|mo&s;t perpetual flow of health; and mo&s;t of the vegetables of Europe grow as freely here as in their native ground: the &s;trawberry, in parti|cular, flouri&s;hes greatly, which is a &s;ufficient proof of the coolne&s;s of the air.</P>
<P>The rice of this country is very plentiful, and, in order to be brought to perfection, &s;hould lie under water more than half the time it is growing: but they have a &s;ort which grows on the &s;ides of the hills, which is unknown in the We&s;t India I&s;lands; this &s;ort is planted when the wet &s;ea&s;on commences, and the crop is ga|thered in &s;oon after the rains are over.</P>
<P>The maize which grows near Batavia is ga|thered while young, and toa&s;ted in the ear. The land likewi&s;e produces carrots, pigeon|pea, celery, par&s;ley, a&s;paragus, onions, rha|di&s;hes, cabbages, lettuces, cucumbers, lentiles, kidney-beans, hy&s;op, &s;age, rue, Chine&s;e white
<PB N="75" REF="76">
rhadi&s;hes, which, when boiled, are not unlike a par&s;nip, common potatoes, &s;weet potatoes, wet and dry yams, millet, and the egg plant, the fruit of which, when broiled and eaten with &s;alt and pepper, is mo&s;t exqui&s;ite food.</P>
<P>Amazing quantities of &s;ugar are produced here, and, while the quantity is beyond com|pari&s;on greater, the care of cultivation is in|conceivably le&s;s than in the We&s;t India I&s;lands. White &s;ugar is retailed at two-pence and two-pence half-penny the pound, and arrack is made of the mola&s;&s;es, with a &s;mall addition of rice, and the wine of the cocoa-nut. The in|habitants likewi&s;e rai&s;e a little indigo for their own u&s;e, but do not export it.</P>
<P>The fruits of this country are near forty in number, and of &s;ome of the&s;e there are &s;everal kinds. Pine apples grow in &s;uch abundance that they may be purcha&s;ed, at the fir&s;t hand, for the value of an Engli&s;h farthing; and they bought &s;ome very large ones for a half-penny a piece at the fruit &s;hops, though they are ex|cellent eating, it is imagined they are reared to equal perfection in the hot-hou&s;es of England. They grow &s;o luxuriantly, that &s;even or eight &s;uckers have been &s;een adhering to one &s;tem.</P>
<P>The &s;weet oranges of Batavia are good of their kind, but very dear at particular times, The &s;haddocks of the We&s;t Indies, called here Pumplemoe&s;es, have an agreeable flavour. Lemons were very &s;carce when the Endeavour
<PB N="76" REF="77">
lay in the harbour, but limes were altogether as plentiful, and &s;old at little more than two-pence the &s;core. There are many kinds of oranges and lemons, but none of them excel|lent. Of mangos there are plenty, but their ta&s;te is far inferior to that of the melting-peach of England, to which they have been compar|ed. It is &s;aid that the heat, and extreme damp|ne&s;s of the climate, does not agree with them; yet there are many different kinds of them. Of bananes there is an amazing variety of &s;orts, &s;ome of which, being boiled, are eaten as bread, while others are fried in batter, and are a nutrimental food: but, of the numerous &s;orts of this fruit, three only are fit to be eaten: one, indeed, is remarkable, becau&s;e it is filled with &s;eeds, which are not common to the re&s;t. Grapes are &s;old from one &s;hilling to eighteen-pence the pound, though they are far from being good.</P>
<P>The tamarinds are equally cheap and plenti|ful; but as the method of pre&s;erving them, which is in &s;alt, renders them a mere black lump, they are equally nau&s;eating to the &s;ight and the palate. The water melons are excellent of their kind, and are produced in great abun|dance. The pumpkins are boiled as turneps, and eaten with &s;alt and pepper. This fruit is admirably adapted to the u&s;e of voyagers, as it will keep many months without care, and makes an excellent pye, when mixed with the juice of lemons and &s;ugar. The papaws of this country
<PB N="77" REF="78">
are &s;uperior to turneps, if the cores are extract|ed, after paring them when they are green. The guava has a &s;trong &s;mell, and a ta&s;te not le&s;s di&s;agreeable: it is probable, that the guava of the We&s;t Indies, which many writers have di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their prai&s;es, has a very different flavour. The &s;weet &s;op is a fruit that has but little flavour: it abounds in large kernels, from which the pulp is &s;ucked. The ta&s;te of the cu&s;tard-apple very much re&s;embles the di&s;h from which its name is taken. The ca&s;hew-apple produces a nut which is not unknown in England; but the fruit has &s;uch an a&s;tringent quality, that the Batavians &s;eldom eat of it: the nut grows on the top of the apple. The cocoa-nut is plentiful in this country, and there are &s;everal kinds of this fruit, the be&s;t of which is very red between the &s;hell and the &s;kin. The jamboo is a fruit that has but little ta&s;te, but is of a cooling nature: it is con&s;iderably le&s;s than a common &s;ized apple, and tho&s;e that have grown to their full &s;ize are always the be&s;t; its &s;hape is oval, and its colour the deep red. Of the jambu-eyer, there are two kinds, the white and the red: they are &s;haped like a bell, and are &s;omething bigger than a cherry: they have no kind of ta&s;te but that of a watery acid. The jambu-eyer mauwar &s;mells like a ro&s;e, and its ta&s;te is not unlike that of con&s;erve of ro&s;es. The mango&s;tan is of a dark red colour, and not larger than a &s;mall apple; to the bottom of
<PB N="78" REF="79">
this fruit adhere &s;everal little leaves of the blo&s;&s;om, while on its top are a number of triangles combined in a circle: it contains &s;e|veral kernels ranged in a circular form, with|in which is the pulp, a fruit of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ta&s;te: it is equally nutritious and agreeable, and is con&s;tantly given to per&s;ons who are trou|bled with inflammatory or putrid fevers. The &s;weet orange of this country is likewi&s;e given in the &s;ame di&s;orders. The pomgranate of the&s;e parts differs in nothing from that generally well known in England. The durion takes its name from the word <HI>dure,</HI> which, in the language of the country, means prickle; and this name is well adapted to the fruit, the &s;hell of which is covered with &s;harp points &s;haped like a &s;ugar-loaf: its contents are nuts, not much &s;maller than che&s;nuts, which are &s;urrounded with a kind of juice re&s;embling cream; and of this the in|habitants eat with great avidity: the &s;mell of this fruit is more like that of onions, than any other European vegetable, and its ta&s;te is like that of onions, &s;ugar, and cream intermixed: the in&s;ide of the durion, when ripe, is parted, lengthways, into &s;everal divi&s;ions. The nanca is a fruit which &s;mells like garlic and apples mixed together: its &s;ize, in the gardens of Ba|tavia, is not greater than that of a middling &s;ized pumpkin, and its &s;hape is nearly the &s;ame: it is covered with prickles of an angu|lar form. They were informed that, at a
<PB N="79" REF="80">
place called Madura, it has been known to grow to &s;uch an enormous &s;ize, as to require the &s;trength of two men to carry it. The cham|pada is in all re&s;pects like the nanca, only that it is not &s;o large. The rambutan contains a fruit, within which is a &s;tone, that is, perhaps, the fine&s;t acid in the world: this fruit is not un|like a che&s;nut with its hu&s;k on; and it is cover|ed with &s;mall prickles of a dark red colour, and &s;o &s;oft as to yield to the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;i|on. The jambolan re&s;embles a dama&s;cen, both in colour and &s;ize; and is of a very a&s;tringent nature. The boa bidarra ta&s;tes like an apple, but is likewi&s;e extremely a&s;tringent; its &s;ize is that of a goo&s;eberry, its form round, and its colour yellow. The nam nam makes an excel|lent fritter, if fried in batter, but is not e&s;teem|ed when raw: the rind of it is rough, its length is about three inches, and its &s;hape not unlike that of a kidney. The catappa and the canare are two &s;pecies of nuts, the kernels of which are like tho&s;e of an almond, but &s;o hard, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to break them. The madja contains a pulp of a &s;harp ta&s;te, which is eaten with &s;ugar: this fruit is covered with a very hard &s;hell. The &s;untal is a fruit &s;carcely fit to be eaten, being at once a&s;tringent, acid, and of a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant ta&s;te, yet it is pub|lickly &s;old in the &s;treets of Batavia: it contains a number of kernels, which are inclo&s;ed in a thick &s;kin. The &s;alack is nearly of the &s;ize of

a &s;mall golden pippin, and contains a few ker|nels of a yellow colour, the ta&s;te of which is not unlike that of a &s;trawberry; but the co|vering of this fruit is very remarkable, as it con&s;i&s;ts of a number of &s;cales re&s;embling tho&s;e of a fi&s;h. The cherrema and the blimbing are two &s;our fruits, exceedingly well adapted to make &s;our &s;auce and pickles. The blimbing be&s;&s;e is another fruit of the &s;ame kind, but con&s;iderably &s;weeter.</P>
<P>Of the fruits not in &s;ea&s;on when Captain Cook was at Batavia, he mentions the boa atap, and the kimkit, which he &s;aw pre&s;erved in &s;u|gar; and there are &s;everal other &s;orts which the Batavians are fond of, but they are never eaten by &s;trangers, among tho&s;e are the mo|ringa, the guilindina, the kellor, and the &s;oc|cum, this la&s;t has the appearance of the bread-fruit, which is produced in the i&s;lands of the South Seas, but it is not near &s;o good; tho' the tree on which it grows is al&s;o exactly like the bread fruit tree.</P>
<P>The fruit &s;old at the common &s;hops is gene|rally too ripe; but in a &s;treet, named Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang, which is inhabited by Chine&s;e frui|terers only, that which is very good may be ob|tained, but at a price greatly exceeding its va|lue. The gardens of gentlemen near the town furni&s;h the&s;e Chine&s;e fruit-&s;ellers; but the other dealers are &s;upplied from a greater di&s;tance up the country, where the inhabitants live by the

cultivation of large tracts of land, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing fruit.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing to conceive what quantities of fruit are eaten at Batavia. Two large markets are held weekly, at di&s;tant places, for the ac|commodation of per&s;ons re&s;iding in different parts of the country; and at the&s;e markets the fruit-&s;ellers of the town meet the gardeners, and purcha&s;e their goods at very low rates: but as the markets are held on Mondays and Sa|turdays, tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be &s;upplied with what is fre&s;h, in the middle of the week, mu&s;t apply to the Chine&s;e dealers above-mentioned, as the heat of the climate renders it unfit for eating in a few days. At the&s;e markets it is common to &s;ee <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fifty or &s;ixty cart-loads of the fine&s;t pine-apples carele&s;sly tumbled toge|ther."</Q></P>
<P>The Batavians, and the natives of other parts of the i&s;land of Java, &s;trew an immen&s;e num|ber of flowers about their hou&s;es, and are al|mo&s;t always burning aromatic woods and gums; which, it is imagined, is done by way of pu|rifying the air; the &s;tench that ari&s;es from the canals and ditches being exceeding nau&s;eous and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The &s;weet &s;cented flowers of this country are very numerous, many of which being totally unknown in England, we &s;hall mention a few of the mo&s;t remarkable.&mdash;The combang ton|quin, and combang caracna&s;&s;i, are very fra|grant

<P>All the above-mentioned kinds of flowers being made into no&s;egays of various &s;hapes, or &s;trung on a piece of thread, are carried through the &s;treets of an evening for &s;ale. The gar|dens of the gentlemen afford many flowers be|&s;ides tho&s;e above-mentioned, but they do not grow in numbers &s;ufficient to be offered to &s;ale.</P>
<P>This country produces a plant, called pan|dang, the leaves of which being &s;hred &s;mall,

and mixed with a variety of flowers, the na|tives, both men and women, fill their clothes and hair with this fragrant mixture, which they likewi&s;e &s;prinkle on their beds, and &s;leep be|neath a profu&s;ion of &s;weets; a &s;ingle &s;heet of fine chintz being all the other covering of the bed.</P>
<P>Formerly the i&s;land of Java produced no kind of &s;pices but pepper, and the quantity which the Dutch bring annually from thence is very con&s;iderable; but the quantity that is made u&s;e of in the country is very &s;mall, as the peo|ple there give the preference to Cayan pepper. The inhabitants are extremely fond of nutmegs and cloves, but they bear too high a price to be much in u&s;e, as the trees which produce them are all become Dutch property.</P>
<P>Cloves are now grown no where but on the i&s;land of Amboina, and &s;ome little i&s;lands near it; the artful Hollanders having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of all the trees, in con&s;equence of &s;eve|ral &s;ub&s;equent treaties of peace, with the &s;eve|ral kings of the other i&s;lands; for at the con|clu&s;ion of every war, the conquerors left the poor Indians &s;till fewer trees, by way of pu|ni&s;hment for their oppo&s;ition, till, in the end, they have de&s;troyed them all.</P>
<P>There are &s;carce any nutmegs, except on the i&s;land of Banda, where they originally grew; this i&s;land, however, produces a plenty, equal to the demand of all the world. On the
<PB N="84" REF="85">
coa&s;t of New Guinea there are a &s;mall number of nutmeg-trees.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Java produces goats, &s;heep, hogs, buffaloes, and hor&s;es. The hor&s;e, which is &s;aid to have been met with here when the country was originally di&s;covered, is a &s;mall, but nimble animal, being &s;eldom above thirteen hands high. The horned cat|tle of this country are different from tho&s;e of Europe: the fle&s;h is extremely lean, but of a very fine grain. Both the Chine&s;e and the natives of the i&s;land feed on the buffa|loe; but the Dutch will neither ta&s;te the fle&s;h nor the milk, from a ridiculous idea, that they are productive of fevers. The &s;heep are tough and ill-ta&s;ted; their &s;kins are hairy, and they have long hanging-ears. A few &s;heep from the Cape of Good Hope being at Batavia, Captain Cook bought &s;ome of them at the rate of a &s;hilling a pound.</P>
<P>The hogs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e breed, are exqui&s;itely fine food, but &s;o extra|vagantly fat, that the lean is always &s;old &s;epa|rately. The butchers, who are Chine&s;e, have no kind of objection to taking off the fat, which they melt, and &s;ell to their countrymen, who eat it with their rice: though the&s;e hogs are &s;uch fine food, yet the Dutch prefer the breed of Holland, which are con&s;equently &s;old at extravagant rates.</P>

<P><PB N="85" REF="87">The Portugue&s;e make a practice of &s;hooting the wild hog, and deer of two kinds, with which the neighbourhood of Batavia abounds: the&s;e are all good eating, and are purcha&s;ed at very moderate prices. The goats of this coun|try are as bad food as the &s;heep. Dogs and cats abound on the i&s;land, and wild hor&s;es and other cattle are found on the mountains at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from Batavia.</P>
<P>Few monkies are &s;een near the town, but there are many of them on the mountains and de&s;art places, where al&s;o are a few rhinocero&s;es, and great numbers of tygers.</P>
<P>The quantity of fi&s;h taken here is a&s;toni&s;hing|ly great, and all the kinds of them are fine food, except a few which are very &s;carce; yet &s;uch is the fal&s;e pride of the inhabitants, that the&s;e few &s;carce &s;orts are &s;old at very high rates, while tho&s;e that are good are &s;old for a mere tri|fle, nor are they eaten but by the &s;laves. A gentleman with whom Captain Cook dined told him, he could have bought a finer di&s;h of fi&s;h for a &s;hilling, than what he had given ten for; but that he &s;hould have been the ridicule of all the politer people, if he had gone to &s;o good a market.</P>
<P>The Dutch will not ta&s;te of the turtle which are taken here: Captain Cook acknowledges that they are fine eating, though not equal to tho&s;e catched in the We&s;t Indies, even when they are dre&s;&s;ed in London. Mr. Banks &s;hot a

lizard five feet in length, which was extremely well ta&s;ted: our adventurers were informed, that &s;ome of the&s;e animals had been &s;een, which were full as thick as the thigh of a man.</P>
<P>This country produces an abundance of poul|try, as excellent of their kinds as tho&s;e of Eng|land. The turkies are immoderately dear, and the pigeons not much le&s;s &s;o; but the gee&s;e, ducks, and fine large fowls are altogether as cheap.</P>
<P>The neighbourhood of Batavia produces &s;nipes of two kinds, one of which was the &s;ame as the Engli&s;h: of the Portugue&s;e, who ap|pear to be the only dealers in wild fowl, any number of thru&s;hes might have been purcha&s;ed. Our adventurers once, and once only, &s;aw a wild duck in the fields, but never ob&s;erved any of the&s;e birds expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and, indeed, wild fowl in general are far from being plenti|ful at Batavia. Captain Cook ob&s;erves, as a &s;ingularity re&s;pecting the &s;nipe, that he is to be met with in all the quarters of the globe, and is &s;een in a greater variety of places than any other of the whole feathered creation.</P>
<P>The liquors of the i&s;land of Java, are palm-wine and arrack; of the former they have three &s;orts, the fir&s;t of which is drunk within a few hours after it is drawn from the tree, and al|mo&s;t in its original &s;tate, when it has a mode|rate &s;weetne&s;s: the &s;econd and third &s;orts are made by fermenting it, and putting various
<PB N="87" REF="89">
herbs and roots into it: the fir&s;t of the&s;e liquors will not occa&s;ion drunkenne&s;s, but the two lat|ter will. The arrack is &s;o generally known, as not to demand any de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The natives of Java profe&s;s the religion of Mahomet, and of cour&s;e do not indulge in wine, at lea&s;t publickly; but not to be exceeded in the vice of drunkenne&s;s by their chri&s;tian neighbours, they are almo&s;t con&s;tantly chewing opium, which is well known to intoxicate in a high degree.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the Chine&s;e, and the Indians of many different nations, who inhabit the town of Batavia, and the country in its neighbourhood, the inhabitants are, proportionably, a very &s;mall number; and even of the&s;e not a fifth part are Dutch, or de&s;cended from natives of Holland: the Portugue&s;e are more in number than all the other Europeans.</P>
<P>The troops in the Dutch &s;ervice are compo&s;ed of the natives of almo&s;t all the kingdoms of Europe; but of the&s;e the Germans out-number all the others. When a per&s;on of any country goes to re&s;ide at Batavia, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he fir&s;t enter as a &s;oldier in the &s;ervice of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, binding him&s;elf to &s;erve five years, which being done, he applies to the Council for leave of ab&s;ence, which be|ing granted of cour&s;e, he then engages in any bu&s;ine&s;s he thinks proper: thus the Dutch have always an army ready to be called forth on any
<PB N="88" REF="90">
emergency. No foreigner, of whatever na|tion, has any &s;hare in the management of pub|lic affairs, all places of power, tru&s;t and profit, being held by the Dutch.</P>
<P>Though the men of other countries are bound to the ob&s;ervation of the above-mention|ed conditions, women, from any part of the globe, may re&s;ide and traffick at Batavia un|mole&s;ted. Captain Cook was informed that, at the time he was there, the whole place could not furni&s;h fifty women who were natives of Europe, yet the town abounded with white wo|men, who were de&s;cended from Europeans, who had &s;ettled there at different times, all the men having paid the debt of nature; for &s;o it is, that the climate of Batavia de&s;troys the men much fa&s;ter than the women. The&s;e women follow the delicate cu&s;tom of chewing betel, after the example of the native Javane&s;e, who&s;e dre&s;s they imitate, and who&s;e manners they copy, in all other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s is conducted at Batavia with the &s;lighte&s;t trouble imaginable: when a merchant receives an order for goods of any kind, he communicates the contents of it to the Chine&s;e, who are the univer&s;al manufacturers. The Chine&s;e Agent delivers the effects on board the &s;hip, for which they are be&s;poke, and tak|ing a receipt for them from the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, he delivers it to the merchant, who pays the Chine&s;e for the goods, and re&s;erves a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="89" REF="91">
profit, without the lea&s;t trouble, ri&s;k, or anxiety. But when a merchant imports goods of any kind, he receives them him&s;elf, and lodges them in his own warehou&s;es. It may be wondered, that the Chine&s;e do not &s;hip the goods on their own account; but from this they are re&s;tricted, and compelled to &s;ell them to the merchants only.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Java di&s;tingui&s;h the Por|tugue&s;e by the name of <HI>Oran&s;erane,</HI> that is, Na|zareen men; but they u&s;e the general term of <HI>Caper,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;ir,</HI> re&s;pecting all who do not pro|fe&s;s the religion of Mahomet; and in this they include the Portugue&s;e. But the Portugue&s;e of Batavia are &s;o only in name; for they have nei|ther any connection with, or knowledge of, the kingdom of Portugal, and they have changed the religion of the church of Rome, for that of Luther. With the manners of the Java|ne&s;e, they are wholly familiarized, and they commonly &s;peak their language, though they are able to conver&s;e in a corrupt kind of Por|tugue&s;e. They dre&s;s in the habit of the coun|try, with a difference only in the manner of wearing their hair: their no&s;es are more peaked, and their &s;kin of a deeper ca&s;t than that of the natives. Some of them are mechanics and artificers, others &s;ub&s;i&s;t by wa&s;hing of linen, and the re&s;t procure a maintenance by hunting.</P>
<P>The Indian inhabitants of Batavia, and the country in its neighbourhood, are not native Ja|vane&s;e,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
but are either born on the &s;everal i&s;lands from whence the Dutch bring their &s;laves, or the offspring of &s;uch as have been born on tho&s;e i&s;lands: and the&s;e having been made free, ei|ther in their own per&s;ons, or in the per&s;ons of their ance&s;tors, enjoy all the privileges of free|men. They receive the general appellation of Oran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">m, which implies, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Believers of the true faith."</Q></P>
<P>The various other Indian inhabitants of this country attach them&s;elves each to the original <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of that, in which either them&s;elves or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ir ance&s;tors were born; keeping them&s;elves apart from tho&s;e of other nations, and practi&s;ing both the virtues and vices peculiar to their own countries. The cultivation of gardens, and the con&s;equent &s;ale of flowers and fruit, afford &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to great numbers of them: the&s;e are the people who rai&s;e the betel and areca, which being mixed with lime, and a &s;ub&s;tance which is called <HI>gambir,</HI> the produce of the Indian con|tinent, is chewed by per&s;ons of all ranks, wo|men as well as men: indeed &s;ome of the politer ladies make an addition of cardamum, and other aromatics, to take off the di&s;agreeable &s;mell with which the breath would be otherwi&s;e hunted. Some of the Indians are very rich, keep a great number of &s;laves, and live, in all re&s;pects, according to the cu&s;toms of their re|&s;pective countries; while others are employed
<PB N="91" REF="93">
to convey goods by water; and others again &s;ub&s;i&s;t by fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Oran&s;lams feed principally on boiled rice, mixed with a &s;mall quantity of dried &s;hrimps and other fi&s;h, which are imported from China, and a little of the fle&s;h of buffaloes and chicken: they are fond of fruit, of which they eat large quantities; and with the &s;lower of the rice they make &s;everal &s;orts of pa&s;try. They &s;ometimes make very &s;uperb entertainments, after the fa&s;hion of their re&s;pective countries; bur, in general, they are a very temperate people: of wine they drink very little, if any, as the religion of Mahomet, which they pro|fe&s;s, forbids the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>When a marriage is to be &s;olemnized among the Oran&s;lams, all the gold and &s;ilver ornaments that can be procured, are borrowed to deck out the young couple, who on the&s;e occa&s;ions never fail to make the mo&s;t &s;plendid appearance. Sumptuous entertainments are given by tho&s;e who can afford them, which continue twelve or fourteen days, and frequently more, during all which time the women take care that the bride|groom &s;hall not vi&s;it his wife privately, though the wedding takes place previous to the fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Indians, though they come from different countries, &s;peak the Malay language, if it de&s;erves that name. On the i&s;land of Java there are two or three different dialects; and there is a language peculiar to every &s;mall
<PB N="92" REF="94">
i&s;land; it is conjectured, that the Malay tongue is a corruption of the language of Malacca.</P>
<P>The hair of the people, which is black, without a &s;ingle exception, grows in great abun|dance: yet the women make u&s;e of oils and other ingredients, to increa&s;e the quantity of it: they fa&s;ten it to the crown of the head with a bodkin, having fir&s;t twi&s;ted it into a circle, round which circle they place an elegant wreath of flowers, &s;o that the whole head-dre&s;s has the mo&s;t beautiful appearence that imagination can form an idea of.</P>
<P>It is the univer&s;al cu&s;tom, both with the men and women, to bathe in a river once every day, and &s;ometimes oftener, which not only pro|motes health, but prevents that contraction of filth, which would be otherwi&s;e unavoidable in &s;o hot a climate.</P>
<P>The teeth of the Oran&s;lams have &s;ome par|ticularities in them well worthy of notice. With a kind of whet&s;tone they rub the ends of them till they are quite flat and even; they then make a deep groove in the teeth of the up|per jaw, in the centre between the bottom of each tooth and the gum, and horizontally with the latter; this groove is equal in depth to a quarter of the thickne&s;s of the teeth; yet none of the&s;e people have a rotten tooth, though, according to the denti&s;ts of England and France, &s;uch a thing mu&s;t be unavoidable, as the tooth is pierced much deeper than
<PB N="93" REF="95">
what we call the enamel. The teeth of the&s;e people become very black by the chewing of betel, yet a &s;light wa&s;hing will take off this blackne&s;s, and the teeth are then perfectly white; but they are very &s;eldom wa&s;hed, as the depth of the colour is very far from being thought di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every per&s;on has read or heard of the Mohawks; and the&s;e are the people who are &s;o denominated, from a corruption of the word Amock, which will be well explained by the following &s;tory and ob&s;ervations. To run a muck is to get drunk with opium, and then &s;eizing &s;ome offen&s;ive weapon, to &s;ally forth from the hou&s;e, kill the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;up|po&s;ed to have injured the Amock, and any other per&s;on that attempts to impede his pa&s;&s;age, till he him&s;elf is taken pri&s;oner, or killed on the &s;pot.&mdash;While Captain Cook was at Batavia, a per&s;on who&s;e circum&s;tances in life were inde|pendent becoming jealous of his brother, in|toxicated him&s;elf with opium, and then mur|dered his brother, and two other men, who en|deavoured to &s;eize him. This man, contrary to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, did not leave his own hou&s;e, but made his re&s;i&s;tance from within it; yet he had taken &s;uch a quantity of the opium, that he was totally delirious, which appeared from his attempting to fire three mu&s;kets, nei|ther of which had been loaded, or even primed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">During the time that Captain Cook was at Batavia, &s;everal in&s;tances of the like kind oc|curred, and he was informed by an officer, who&s;e duty it was to take &s;uch offenders into cu&s;tody, that hardly a week pa&s;&s;ed in the year in which he was not obliged to exerci&s;e his au|thority: the Captain was al&s;o told, that jea|lou&s;y of the women is the u&s;ual rea&s;on of the&s;e poor creatures running a muck, and that the fir&s;t object of their vengeance is always the per&s;on whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have injured them. The officer, whole bu&s;ine&s;s it is to apprehend the&s;e unhappy wretches, is furni&s;hed with a long pair of tongs, in order to take hold of them at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the point of their weapons, as to in&s;ure his per&s;onal &s;afety. When he takes one of them alive he is amply rewarded; but this is not often the ca&s;e, as they are &s;o de&s;perate as not to be ea&s;ily apprehended: when they are killed in the attempt to take them, the officer has only the cu&s;tomary grati|fication. Tho&s;e who are taken alive are broken on the wheel, as near as po&s;&s;ible to the place where the fir&s;t murder was perpetrated; and, as they are &s;eldom apprehended without being previou&s;ly wounded, the time of their execu|tion is &s;ooner or later, according to the opi|nions of the phy&s;icians, whether the wounds are, or are not mortal.</P>
<P>The Oran&s;lams believe that the Devil is the author of &s;ickne&s;s, and other misfortunes, on
<PB N="95" REF="97">
which account they make an oblation of meat, money, and other things, to him, when they are either &s;ick or in trouble. When they dream &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for &s;everal nights, they have no doubt but that the Devil has enjoined the per|formance of &s;ome act, to di&s;cover which they torture their brains in vain, and then apply to the prie&s;t, who never fails to interpret the dream in a &s;atisfactory manner. In con&s;equence of this interpretation, by which it appears that the Devil is in want of money and food, a quantity of each is placed in the leaves of the cocoa-nut tree, and being hung on the bough of a tree by the &s;ide of a river, is left till &s;ome pa&s;&s;en|ger &s;hall find, and take away the money, which is con&s;idered not &s;o much an offering to the Devil, as a fine due for &s;ome crime committed; with regard to the food, they imagine that the Devil comes and &s;ucks out the nutritious parts of it, without moving it out of its place. From this part of the &s;tory it &s;eems rea&s;onable to con|clude, that the prie&s;t, having previous know|ledge where the oblation is to be made, takes the money, and leaves the victuals.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance of the &s;uper&s;tition of the&s;e people may be thought very extraordinary; but the following will appear much more &s;o. They are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an idea, that when one of their wives is brought to bed, a crocodile is born, as a brother to the infant; and they imagine that the midwife conveys the young
<PB N="96" REF="98">
crocodile to an adjacent river, into which &s;he puts it, with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s. Tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves honoured by the birth of this new relation, fail not to put food in the river for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but this is the peculiar duty of the twin brother, who per|forms this &s;ervice regularly, at fixed periods, during the whole cour&s;e of his life; firmly be|lieving at the &s;ame time, that &s;ickne&s;s or death would be the con&s;equence of an omi&s;&s;ion on his part.</P>
<P>In the i&s;lands of Boutou and Celebes the na|tives keep crocodiles in their families; and it is conjectured, that the &s;trange idea of the twin crocodile was fir&s;t conceived in one of tho&s;e i&s;lands: it extends, however, to Java and Su|matra we&s;tward, and among the i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward as far as Ceram and Timor. It is a matter of perfect a&s;toni&s;hment, how even the mo&s;t ignorant and credulous of the human race, &s;hould firmly believe an utter impo&s;&s;ibility to occur daily; yet it is certain, that not one of the Indians whom Captain Cook que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject, entertained the lea&s;t doubt about the matter. The crocodiles &s;uppo&s;ed to be thus born are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Sudaras,</HI> and our readers cannot fail of being entertained w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th the following &s;tory re&s;pecting them, which Mr. Banks heard from a young woman who was born at B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">, and having lived among the Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;h at that place, had

learnt to &s;peak as much of our language as was &s;ufficient to make her &s;tory intelligible.</P>
<P>She &s;aid that, when her father was on his death-bed, he laid the &s;tronge&s;t injunctions on her to feed a crocodile that was his <HI>Sudara</HI>; that he told her the name by which he might be called up, and the particular part of the ri|ver where &s;he would find him. Soon after the death of her father, &s;he ha&s;tened to the river, and calling <HI>Radja Pouti</HI> (which &s;ignifies white king) the Sudara crocodile made his appearance, and &s;he fed him with her own hands. She de&s;cribed him as being more beautiful than crocodiles are in general, for he had a red no&s;e, and &s;pots on his body; his ears were adorned with rings, and his feet with orna|ments of gold. This &s;tory will appear the more extravagantly ridiculous, when it is recol|lected that crocodiles have not any ears.</P>
<P>A man who&s;e mother was a native of the i&s;land of Java, and who&s;e father was a Dutch|man, was engaged in the &s;ervice of Mr. Banks during his re&s;idence at Batavia. This man told his ma&s;ter that &s;everal Dutchmen, and many Javane&s;e, as well as him&s;elf, had &s;een &s;uch a crocodile as was de&s;cribed by the girl who told the preceding &s;tory, and that, like her's, its feet were adorned with gold. On Mr. Banks's remarking the ab&s;urdity of the&s;e tales, and &s;aying that crocodiles had not ears, he replied, that the Sudaras differed con&s;idera|bly
<PB N="98" REF="100">
from other crocodiles; that they had ears, though he acknowledged they were &s;mall, that their tongues filled their mouths, and that on each foot they had five toes.</P>
<P>There are three tribes of Indians on the i&s;land of Batavia, who are called Boetons, Maca&s;|&s;ars, and Bougis. The&s;e people are firm be|lievers in the exi&s;tence of the Sudara croco|diles; and they have a cu&s;tom among them, which, however ridiculous in it&s;elf, &s;eems to do honour to their filial and fraternal affections. At fixed periods they a&s;&s;emble together, and having laden a large boat with various &s;orts of provi&s;ions, they launch her at a &s;pot mo&s;t likely to be frequented by crocodiles; here they row about, &s;ometimes &s;inging and &s;ometimes weep|ing, while a variety of mu&s;ical in&s;truments are played on, till they get &s;ight of a crocodile. The moment this happens they throw tobacco, betel and victuals of &s;everal &s;orts, over the &s;ide of the boat, as a friendly offering to the Su|dara crocodiles of their own country; ima|gining, that by this means they conciliate the affections and good will of their relations, whom they fail not to invoke during the whole of the ceremony.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e inhabitants of Batavia are, like tho&s;e of their own country, &s;ome of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ople on the face of the earth. They act as embroiderers, dyers of cotton, tay|lors, carpenters, joiners, &s;miths, and makers
<PB N="99" REF="101">
of &s;lippers: &s;ome of them are &s;hop-keepers, and deal largely in the manufactures of Europe and China. A few of the&s;e people live within the walls of the town; but the majority of them take up their re&s;idence in a di&s;trict, named Campang China, which is &s;ituated without the walls. Tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e, who live in the country, either keep buffaloes and other cattle, the milk of which they &s;ell daily at Batavia, or they procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the rai&s;ing of rice and &s;ugar canes, and the cultivation of gardens.</P>
<P>Captain Cook ob&s;erves, that the danger of being hanged for any crime being excepted, there is nothing, however infamous, which a Chine&s;e will refu&s;e to do for gain; and in this opinion he concurs with every preceding wri|ter; &s;o that the&s;e people mu&s;t have taken no &s;mall pains to e&s;tabli&s;h their reputation for knavery. They labour with unwearied dili|gence, but the moment they have compleated their work they &s;it down to dice, cards, or &s;ome other of the very numerous games which they are expert at; and they follow their &s;ports with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of eating and &s;leeping is frequently &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The cloaths of the Chine&s;e, whether rich or poor, are &s;ingularly clean and decent. Their behaviour is civil even to humility. They are &s;uch temperate eaters, that gluttony is unknown among them; but as their religion does not command them to refrain from any particular
<PB N="100" REF="102">
food, they eat a variety of things which are denied to tho&s;e Indians who profe&s;s the Maho|metan faith. Exclu&s;ive of vegetables and fi&s;h of various kinds, their principal food con&s;i&s;ts of dogs, cats, lizards, frogs, &s;erpents of &s;e|veral &s;orts, and hogs.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have purcha&s;ed of the Dutch, at a very large expence, &s;everal hundred acres of land in the vicinity of Batavia, for the inter|ment of their dead; for it is a rule, from which they never depart, not to open a grave which has once received the body of one of their countrymen: and hence ari&s;es an enormous ex|pence in the purcha&s;e of land, which greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;es the living, to pay an imaginary ho|nour to the dead. In order to pre&s;erve the body as long as po&s;&s;ible from decay, the coffin con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of &s;olid timber hollowed out: and this being covered with a kind of mortar &s;everal inches thick, petrifies in the ground till it is as hard as a flint. The funeral is attended by the near relations of the decea&s;ed, and by a train of women, who are paid for mak|ing lamentations.</P>
<P>In the&s;e expen&s;ive cu&s;toms, ab&s;urd as they are, the Chine&s;e are equalled by the re&s;t of their Batavian neighbours; for every per&s;on is buried with a degree of &s;plendour proportioned to the rank he has held in life, and there is a po&s;itive law which enjoins the ob&s;ervance of this cu&s;tom; in con&s;equence of which it frequently
<PB N="101" REF="103">
happens, that tho&s;e who have not money &s;uffi|cient to pay the ju&s;t demands on them, are buried in a pompous manner, merely becau&s;e they have lived elegantly. In this ca&s;e per&s;ons are employed to take an account of what the man died worth, and, when the funeral expen|ces are defrayed, the &s;urplus is divided among the creditors.</P>
<P>The various inhabitants of the i&s;land of Ja|va, whether Dutch, Portugue&s;e or Indians, are all waited on by &s;laves, who&s;e number is pro|portioned to the circum&s;tances of the ma&s;ter; but there are laws in force, that no native of the i&s;land &s;hall &s;erve as a &s;lave. The&s;e people, the number of which is very great, are bought at Sumatra, and the other ea&s;tern i&s;lands, at various prices, from ten to twenty pounds; but there have been in&s;tances of very beautiful girls being &s;old at above five times the common market price. They are fed on boiled rice, and &s;uch fi&s;h as can be purcha&s;ed at the lowe&s;t rates; a little of which &s;atisfies them, nor in|deed do they de&s;erve even the little they eat, for they are idle and &s;luggi&s;h in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The negroes of Africa are purcha&s;ed at a lower price than any other &s;laves, and indeed any price whatever exceeds their merit, for they are of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;po&s;itions, and thieves, without a &s;ingle exception. Tho&s;e &s;laves which are purcha&s;ed from the i&s;land of
<PB N="102" REF="104">
Celebes are mo&s;t intolerably lazy, and of &s;o ferocious a di&s;po&s;ition, that their employers run the hazard of their per&s;onal &s;afety. The i&s;land of Bali furni&s;hes the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;laves; and the little i&s;land Nias, near Sumatra, &s;up|plies female &s;laves of exqui&s;ite beauty; but to the&s;e ill-fated women death is the almo&s;t cer|tain con&s;equence of even a &s;hort re&s;idence at Batavia.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ters of any of the&s;e &s;laves may pu|ni&s;h them in whatever way they chu&s;e, &s;o as not to deprive them of life; but when it hap|pens that a &s;lave dies of the puni&s;hment he has received, the ma&s;ter is tried, and commonly &s;uffers as a murderer. From this circum&s;tance it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ma&s;ters are cautious how they beat the &s;laves with undue &s;everity: it is not indeed very common for them to &s;trike them at all, but they pay an officer, who is called the Marineu, for inflicting the puni&s;hment. The Marineu having heard what is alledged again&s;t the delinquent, determines how many &s;tripes he &s;hall receive, and the&s;e are given by &s;laves, who&s;e particular bu&s;ine&s;s it is to obey the commands of the Marineu: the&s;e &s;trokes are laid on with rods made of rat|tans &s;plit very &s;mall. For a &s;evere whipping the Marineu receives a ducatoon, and a rixdol|lar for a &s;lighter puni&s;hment. The women &s;laves are whipped in the hou&s;e of the ma&s;ter, but the men publickly in the &s;treets. In
<PB N="103" REF="105">
order that the&s;e &s;laves may not be under too great temptations to &s;teal, their ma&s;ters are compelled to allow them &s;even pence half-penny weekly for pocket-money.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;ingular in the &s;ubordi|nation ob&s;erved among the inhabitants of Ba|tavia and the adjacent country. The man who has been longe&s;t in the Dutch Ea&s;t India Com|pany's &s;ervice is permitted to gild his coach, while others are allowed to ride in coaches dif|ferently painted, according to the length of their &s;ervices, and others again ride in tho&s;e that are quite plain. In like manner the coach|men are dre&s;&s;ed in liveries, that have a greater or le&s;s quantity of lace on them, or without any lace at all.</P>
<P>The lawyers of Batavia are partial in their admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, to a very reprehen|&s;ible degree. When an Indian has committed any crime deemed worthy of death, he is im|paled, hanged, or broken on the wheel, with|out ceremony: on the contrary, if a Chri&s;tian is capitally convicted, execution very &s;eldom follows the &s;entence: and, what is more extra|ordinary, no pains are taken to apprehend the offender, till time enough has been allowed him to run away, if he thinks proper.</P>
<P>The civil officers of ju&s;tice among the Chi|ne&s;e and Malays are called Captains and Lieu|tenants, but their deci&s;ions are not final, if the party again&s;t whom they may decide, thinking
<PB N="104" REF="106">
him&s;elf aggrieved, &s;hould appeal to the Dutch lawyers, in which ca&s;e the deci&s;ion of the lat|ter mu&s;t be abided by.</P>
<P>The Dutch have laid con&s;iderable taxes on the&s;e people, among which is one for the per|mi&s;&s;ion to wear their hair. When the&s;e taxes become due, which is once a month, they hoi&s;t a flag on the top of a hou&s;e, nearly in the cen|ter of Batavia, and the man who does not &s;peedily go and pay his money, has rea&s;on to repent the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The current money of this country is of dif|ferent value, from a Dutch doit to a ducat. When Captain Cook was at Batavia, Spani&s;h dollars &s;old at five &s;hillings and five-pence each, and the price is &s;eldom much lower. The Chi|ne&s;e would give only the value of twenty &s;hil|lings for an Engli&s;h guinea that was almo&s;t new, and for tho&s;e that were old, and much worn, only &s;eventeen &s;hillings.</P>
<P>The milled ducatoons of Batavia are valued at eighty &s;tivers; tho&s;e that are unmilled at &s;e|venty-two; the ducat at one hundred and thirty-two; the imperial rixdollars at &s;ixty; the rupees at thirty; the &s;chellings at &s;ix; the double cheys at two and a half; and the doits at a quarter of a &s;tiver.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to a recital of the in|cidents which occurred during their pa&s;&s;age from Batavia to the Cape of Good Hope; in which we &s;hall trace them with the utmo&s;t fi|delity,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
omitting not a &s;ingle circum&s;tance that may either entertain or in&s;truct the reader.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 27th of Decem|ber 1770, the Endeavour left the road of Ba|tavia, and, after &s;everal hindrances, occa&s;ioned by the wind being contrary, &s;he &s;tood over for the &s;hore of Java, on the fir&s;t day of January 1771. As many of the &s;hip's crew, who had been very ill while at Batavia, were now be|come much wor&s;e, the ve&s;&s;el was brought to an anchor in the afternoon of the 5th near Princes I&s;land, with a view to get &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hments, and likewi&s;e to take in wood and water.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ieurs Solander and Banks now went a|&s;hore with the Captain, and they were no &s;ooner landed, than &s;ome of the natives conducted them to the King of the i&s;land, with whom they endeavoured to make a bargain for &s;ome turtle, but the price could not be agreed on. As our adventurers had no doubt but that they &s;hould purcha&s;e on their own terms the following day, they left the Indians, and proceeded in &s;earch of a proper place to fill water, which was &s;oon found. As they were about to embark for the &s;hip, they purcha&s;ed three turtle from &s;ome of the natives, but with the &s;tricte&s;t injunction, that their Sovereign &s;hould not be informed of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 6th of January they pur|cha&s;ed, at very moderate prices, as many turtle
<PB N="106" REF="108">
as they had occa&s;ion for, and the whole &s;hip's company fed on this delicious fi&s;h. The King was at this time at a hou&s;e &s;ituated in a rice field, where Mr. Banks waited on him, and found him cooking his own victuals.</P>
<P>On Monday the inhabitants brought vegeta|bles, deer, fi&s;h, fowls and monkies, for &s;ale; and on the following day they brought down a farther number of turtle.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant that Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia having acquainted him, that there was a town on the i&s;land, his curio&s;ity determined him to have a view of it, and one of the officers of the &s;hip accompanied him on his vi&s;it. As he was apprehen&s;ive that the natives would not be plea&s;ed at his going to the town, he told &s;uch of them as he met, that he was &s;eeking for plants, which, in fact, was a part of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the day. Having come to a kind of village, con&s;i&s;ting of a very few hou&s;es, they a&s;ked an Indian the way to the town, and &s;ome other particulars re&s;pecting it; but he endea|voured to prevent their proceeding, by repre|&s;enting it as at a very great di&s;tance. When he &s;aw they were re&s;olved to go forward, he pro|ceeded with them, making frequent attempts to mi&s;lead them. When they were within &s;ight of the town, the Indian changed his behaviour at once, and led the way to it.</P>
<P>This place, which contains between three and four hundred hou&s;es, is called Samadang, and
<PB N="107" REF="109">
is parted by a river into the old and the new town. Some of the natives, whom the gentle|men remembered to have &s;een among tho&s;e who had brought provi&s;ions for &s;ale, agreed to carry them from the old town to the new for a trifling gratification. This was done by means of two little canoes, which were la&s;hed toge|ther; and they had no &s;ooner reached the op|po&s;ite &s;hore, than the Indians &s;hewed them the hou&s;es of their Chiefs, and behaved otherwi&s;e in the mo&s;t friendly manner; but as this was the &s;ea&s;on when the natives live in their rice-grounds, to &s;ave their corn from the depreda|tions of the monkies and birds, mo&s;t of the hou&s;es were &s;hut. When the gentlemen had &s;een every thing that they thought worthy of notice, they hired a &s;ailing-boat, which con|veyed them to the &s;hip time enough for dinner; for the town of Samadang, though at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance from the place where the En|deavour lay at anchor, is &s;ituated at only a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 12th, while the Captain was on &s;hore giving orders to the people who were cutting wood and filling water, he was told, that one of the natives had &s;tolen an ax. The thief was unknown; but the Captain, re&s;olved not to pave the way for future depredations of this kind, by taking no notice of the fir&s;t offence, immediately applied to the King; and in con&s;e|quence of this application, the ax was brought
<PB N="108" REF="110">
down to the watering-place the next day. The Indian who brought it back &s;aid, it was left at his hou&s;e in the night; but it was &s;u&s;pected, that him&s;elf was the thief.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks having &s;everal times vi&s;ited on the King of the i&s;land, and given him &s;ome trifles that were very acceptable, he waited on him for the la&s;t time on the 13th of January, and gratified him very much by a pre&s;ent of a &s;mall quantity of paper. The King a&s;ked the rea&s;on why the Engli&s;h &s;hips did not touch at the i&s;land, as was formerly their cu&s;tom; when Mr. Banks attributed the omi&s;&s;ion to the &s;carci|ty of turtle, and advi&s;ed the King to breed buffaloes, &s;heep and cattle, for the accommo|dation of his future vi&s;itants.</P>
<P>After a &s;tay of ten days at Princes I&s;land, during which they purcha&s;ed vegetables of va|rious kinds, fowls, deer, turtle, &amp;c. the an|chor was weighed, and the ve&s;&s;el once more put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to a de&s;cription of the i&s;land, which lies in the we&s;tern mouth of the Streight of Sunda. It is a &s;mall woody i&s;land, and has been cleared only in very few places. Our India &s;hips u&s;ed to touch at Princes I&s;land to take in water, but they have omitted this practice for &s;ome years &s;ince, on account, as it is &s;aid, of the water being bracki&s;h; yet Cap|tain Cook &s;ays it is exceeding good, if filled to|wards the head of the brook.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">The fowls which were purcha&s;ed at this place co&s;t about five-pence each; the turtle three-farthings a pound, and other fi&s;h were propor|tionably cheap; one hundred of the be&s;t cocoa-nuts co&s;t only a dollar, and pumpkins, pine-ap|ples and other fruits, were equally cheap and plenty.</P>
<P>The natives profe&s;s the religion of Maho|met, and are &s;o &s;trict in the ob&s;ervance of the fea&s;t called <HI>Ramadan,</HI> that they not only ab&s;tain from food till the &s;un is down, but even from the chewing of betel. The manners of the&s;e people are not unlike tho&s;e of the Javane&s;e; but they are much more jealous of their wives: during the ten days that the Endeavour lay here, only one woman was &s;een, and &s;he ran away the moment &s;he was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are con&s;tructed in the form of an oblong &s;quare: they are built on pillars four feet above the ground, and well thatched with palm-leaves, as a defence from the &s;un and rain: the flooring is of bamboo canes, placed at a di&s;tance from each other, to admit the air: the&s;e hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of four rooms, one of which is de&s;tined for the reception of vi&s;itants, the children &s;leep in a &s;econd, and the two others are allotted, the one for the purpo&s;e of cooke|ry, and the other for the bed-chamber of the owner and his wife. The re&s;idence of the King of the i&s;land, and that of another per&s;on of great authority, has boards on the &s;ides, while
<PB N="110" REF="112">
the hou&s;es of all the inferior people have walls made of the bamboo cane, &s;lit into &s;mall &s;ticks, and wrought acro&s;s the beams of the building, in the manner of a hurdle. The King of the i&s;land is &s;ubject to the Sultan of Bantam.</P>
<P>Captain Cook repre&s;ents the natives as very hone&s;t in their dealings, with the &s;ingle ex|ception, of demanding more than double the &s;um they intended to &s;ell for: the goods of each &s;ort which different per&s;ons brought to market were all &s;old together, and the purcha&s;e-money divided among the &s;everal contributors, in proportion to the quantity that each had given in to the general &s;tock. When they changed money, they gave two hundred and forty Dutch doits for a Spani&s;h dollar.</P>
<P>The natives &s;peak a language which they call <HI>Catta Gunung,</HI> that is, the language of the mountains, and they &s;ay, that their ance&s;tors came from the mountains of Java, where this language is &s;poken; that they fir&s;t &s;ettled at New Bay, where the tygers were &s;o numerous, that they could not live in &s;afety, and therefore took up their re&s;idence on Prince's I&s;land: all the&s;e people, however, are capable of conver&s;ing in the Malay language.</P>
<P>At the time the Endeavour left Princes I&s;land, her crew began to feel, in all its force, the ill effects of the putrid air of Batavia; and &s;oon afterwards the &s;hip was a mere ho&s;pital, filled with unhappy wretches, &s;inking under the rage
<PB N="111" REF="113">
of fevers and dy&s;enteries. In the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks twenty-three per&s;ons died, exclu&s;ive of the &s;even which had been buried at Batavia: the&s;e were nine &s;eamen, the Corporal of the marines, the &s;hip's Cook, two of the Carpen|ter's crew, the Carpenter and his Mate, a Mid|&s;hipman, the old &s;ail-maker, who was in perfect health when all the re&s;t were ill at Batavia, and his Mate, the Boat&s;wain, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, a Mid&s;hipman, Mr. Sporing, who accompanied Mr. Banks, Mr. Parkin&s;on, draught&s;man to that gentleman, and Mr. Green, the A&s;tro|nomer.</P>
<P>After a pa&s;&s;age in which nothing remarkable occurred, the &s;hip was brought to an anchor off the Cape of Good Hope, on the 15th of March 1771. The Captain repaired in&s;tantly to the Governor, who &s;aid, that &s;uch refre&s;hments as the country &s;upplied, &s;hould be chearfully granted him; on which a hou&s;e was hired for the &s;ick, who were to have their board and lodging, on the payment of two &s;hillings a day for each man.</P>
<P>At the time the Endeavour lay at anchor here, an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t Indiaman &s;ailed for the port of London, who had buried above thirty of her crew while &s;he was in India; and at that time had many others &s;everely afflicted with the &s;curvy; &s;o that the &s;ufferings of the crew of the Endeavour, con&s;idering her long ab&s;ence from
<PB N="112" REF="114">
England, is a circum&s;tance not at all to be won|dered at.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to a de&s;cription of the Cape of Good Hope, in which we &s;hall only mention &s;uch particulars as are either wholly new, or &s;uch as have been mi&s;-repre&s;ented by other writers. The land over the Cape is mountainous, and totally barren; beyond the&s;e mountains the country is covered with a light &s;and, which will not admit of cultivation: there are indeed a few cultivated &s;pots, but they are hardly more than a thou&s;andth part of the whole country. Provi&s;ions are brought to the Cape from a di&s;tance nine hundred miles up the country, which is an evident proof of its ex|treme &s;terility, notwith&s;tanding what has been heretofore written to the contrary. While Cap|tain Cook lay here, a farmer came to the Cape, bringing his young children with him, from a di&s;tance that took him fifteen days journey; and on his being a&s;ked why he had not left his children with &s;ome neighbour, he &s;aid, there was no inhabitant within five days journey of his farm. There are no trees that are even two yards in height, except in &s;ome plantations in the vicinity of Cape town.</P>
<P>This town con&s;i&s;ts of near a thou&s;and brick hou&s;es, the out&s;ides of which being generally plai&s;tered, they have a very plea&s;ing appear|ance. There is a canal in the main &s;treet, with two rows of oak-trees on its borders, which are

in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate than the other trees of this country: the &s;treets, which cro&s;s each other at right angles, are very &s;pacious and hand&s;ome. The inhabitants are chiefly Dutch, or of Dutch extraction: the women are beau|tiful in a high degree, and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e bloom|ing countenances which denote the mo&s;t perfect health: they are mo&s;t of them mothers of many children, and Captain Cook &s;ays, they are the be&s;t wives in the world.</P>
<P>The air of the Cape of Good Hope is &s;o pure and &s;alubrious, that a &s;ick per&s;on, who goes thither from Europe, whatever be his di&s;order, almo&s;t always recovers his health in a little time; but tho&s;e who bring di&s;ea&s;es with them from the Ea&s;t Indies, have not an equal chance of recovery.</P>
<P>Although this country is naturally &s;o barren, as &s;carcely to produce any thing, yet the un|cea&s;ing indu&s;try of its inhabitants has &s;o effec|tually combated the &s;paring hand of Nature, that there are few places where the nece&s;&s;aries of life are more plentiful, and even what are generally deemed luxuries, are by no means &s;carce. The con&s;tantia wine is known to be excellent, but the genuine &s;ort is made only at one particular vineyard a few miles from the town. The gardens produce many &s;orts of European and Indian fruits, and almo&s;t all the common kinds of vegetables. The cultivated fields yield wheat and barley of equal quality

with that of the growth of England. The &s;heep of this country have tails of a very ex|traordinary &s;ize, many of which weigh upwards of a dozen pounds; the meat of this animal as well as of the ox, is very fine food: the wool of the &s;heep is rather of the hairy kind, and the horns of the black cattle &s;pread much wider than tho&s;e of England, while the bea&s;t him&s;elf is hand&s;omer and lighter made. The chee&s;e has a very indifferent flavour, but the butter is extremely good. The pork of this country is nearly the &s;ame as that of Europe, and there are abundance of goats, but the in|habitants do not eat their fle&s;h. The country abounds in hares, altogether like tho&s;e of Eng|land; there are &s;everal &s;pecies of the antelope, a plenty of bu&s;tards, and two kinds of quails.</P>
<P>When a &s;tranger arrives at the Cape, it is cu&s;tomary for him to board in a private hou&s;e, and he pays from two &s;hillings to a crown a day, according to the accommodations he ex|pects. If he appears and behaves as a gentle|man, he is invited to the private entertainments which are given by the more opulent of the in|habitants; and this cannot fail of being the more acceptable, as there are no places of pub|lic diver&s;ion in the country. Hor&s;es are here let to hire at &s;ix &s;hillings a day, and coaches at one pound four.</P>
<P>The Dutch company have a garden at the extremity of the high &s;treet, which is more
<PB N="115" REF="117">
than half a mile in length, in the center walk of which are a number of fine oak trees. A &s;mall part of this garden is covered with bota|nical plants, but all the re&s;t is allotted to the production of the common vegetables for the kitchen: the whole is divided into &s;quares by the form of its walks, and each &s;quare is fen|ced in by oaks cut into &s;mall hedges. There is a menagerie of bea&s;ts and birds, many of them known in Europe, at the upper end of this garden; and among the re&s;t is the <HI>Coe Doe,</HI> a bea&s;t not le&s;s than a hor&s;e, which has tho&s;e cu|rious &s;piral horns that have frequently found a place in the cabinets of the curious.</P>
<P>The native inhabitants of this country are u&s;ually dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;heep &s;kin thrown acro&s;s the &s;houlders, and a little pouch before them, to which is fixed a kind of belt, ornamented with little bits of copper, and beads: round the wai&s;ts of the women is a broad piece of lea|ther, and rings of the &s;ame round their ancles, to protect them from the thorns, which grow in abundance all over the country; a few of them wear a kind of &s;hoe, made of the bark of a tree, but the major part of them go bare|footed: both &s;exes adorn them&s;elves with brace|lets and necklaces, made of beads. None of the&s;e people re&s;ide at a le&s;s di&s;tance than four days journey from Cape Town, except a num|ber of the poorer &s;ort, who look after the cat|tle belonging to the Dutch farmers, and are
<PB N="116" REF="118">
employed in various other menial offices. Their &s;tature is about the &s;ame as that of the people of England, from five to &s;ix feet in height; but &s;carce any of them are corpulent: their &s;kins are dark, but this is in a great degree ow|ing to their extreme indelicacy: their hair curls naturally, and falls in finglets of above &s;ix inches in length: they are &s;ingular for their &s;trength and agility.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Hottentots &s;peak the Dutch language, without any thing remarkable in their manner; yet, when they conver&s;e in their native language, they frequently &s;top, and make a clucking with their tongues, which has a mo&s;t &s;ingular and ridiculous effect to the ears of a &s;tranger; and, exclu&s;ive of this clucking, their language it&s;elf is &s;carcely &s;ounded arti|culately.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are mode&s;t to the utmo&s;t de|gree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and, though they are fond of &s;inging and dancing, can hardly be pre|vailed on to divert them&s;elves with their fa|vourite amu&s;ements before &s;trangers: both their &s;inging and dancing are alternately quick and &s;low in the utmo&s;t extreme.</P>
<P>Some of the Hottentots under&s;tand the art of melting and preparing copper, with which they make plates, and wear them on their fore|heads, as an article of finery. They are al&s;o capable of making knives, &s;uperior to tho&s;e
<PB N="117" REF="119">
they can purcha&s;e of the Dutch, from whom they procure the iron.</P>
<P>They have the art of making butter by &s;haking milk in the &s;kin of a bea&s;t: with this butter they anoint their &s;kins; or, when they cannot procure butter, they u&s;e the fat of the &s;heep. The principal people are owners of im|men&s;e herds of cattle; and the&s;e clothe them|&s;elves with the &s;kins of lions and other bea&s;ts, which are adorned with fringes, elegantly de|&s;igned.</P>
<P>The Hottentots are &s;o dextrous in throwing &s;tones, that they will hit a mark not larger than a crown piece, at the di&s;tance of an hundred yards. They are likewi&s;e expert in the u&s;e of arrows, and of the lance called an A&s;&s;agay, the points of which they poi&s;on, &s;ometimes with the venom of a &s;erpent, and &s;ometimes with the juice of particular herbs; &s;o that a wound received from either of the&s;e weapons is almo&s;t always mortal.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of what is above recited, they met with nothing re&s;pecting the&s;e people, but &s;uch particulars as have been previou&s;ly mentioned by various other voyagers, and which will of cour&s;e be found in the preceding volumes: we &s;hall therefore accompany the &s;hip in her voy|age to England.</P>
<P>On the 14th of April, 1771, the anchor of the Endeavour was weighed, and &s;he once more put to &s;ea, but came to an anchor again

before night near Robin i&s;land. As a few ve|getables were wanted, which they had neglected to take in at the Cape, the Captain &s;ent off a boat to the i&s;land; but, when &s;he reached the &s;hore, &s;ome Dutch &s;oldiers forbad her crew landing, at the hazard of their lives; and the officer who commanded very prudently return|ed to the &s;hip. For &s;ome time they were puz|zled to account for this behaviour on the part of the Dutch; but it was at length recollected, that the Dutch government at the Cape of Good Hope had a&s;&s;igned this i&s;land for the recep|tion of &s;uch offenders who&s;e crimes were not deemed worthy of death, where their &s;lavery con&s;i&s;ts in digging lime-&s;tone, for &s;uch a num|ber of years as are thought proportionable to the heinou&s;ne&s;s of their offences: and that a &s;hip belonging to Denmark, which had buried mo&s;t of her hands, had called at this i&s;land, and taken on board a number of the&s;e crimi|nals, in order to navigate the ve&s;&s;el to Europe: hence the conduct of the Dutch &s;oldiers was ea&s;ily accounted for.</P>
<P>The &s;hip &s;ailed again on the following day, when the ma&s;ter of her died, having ha&s;tened his death by hard drinking, though, in other re&s;pects, he left behind him an excellent cha|racter.</P>
<P>On Monday, May-day, they came to an an|chor off the i&s;land of St. Helena, and, as they propo&s;ed to remain three days, Mr. Banks em|ployed
<PB N="119" REF="121">
the interval in &s;urveying every object that was thought worthy of notice.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of St. Helena ri&s;es out of the immen&s;e Atlantic ocean, is about eighteen hun|dred miles from the coa&s;t of America, and twelve hundred from that of Africa. It has the appearance of a huge mountain, the foun|dation of which is probably at the center of the globe. It had formerly volcanoes in &s;everal parts of it, as is evident from the appearance of the earth and &s;tones in many places; and it looks like a clu&s;ter of rocks, bounded by pre|cipices of immen&s;e height: as a ve&s;&s;el &s;ails along the coa&s;t, the cliffs perpend over her head &s;o as to threaten her in&s;tant de&s;truction, and nothing in nature can be conceived more awful than their appearance.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the &s;ea-&s;ide &s;tands the town, which had formerly a church of very indifferent ar|chitecture, but it is now little better than a heap of ruins, nor is the market-hou&s;e in a much better condition: mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are al&s;o con&s;tructed in a vile ta&s;te.</P>
<P>As this i&s;land is the property of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company, the inhabitants are not &s;uffered to carry on any trade for their own emolument, but get their livelihood by &s;elling the productions of the i&s;land to the crews of the ve&s;&s;els which anchor there for a &s;upply of re|fre&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">St. Helena is &s;o happily &s;ituated, with regard to climate, that it would, if properly cultivat|ed, produce the trees, fruits, plants and flow|ers, of all the different parts of the world. On the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t ridges the cabbage-tree flouri&s;hes; in the parts below the&s;e grow the gum-wood and red-wood, and in the vallies many of the plants of the Indies, and almo&s;t all tho&s;e of Europe; yet the&s;e &s;everal produc|tions will not grow but on the &s;pots of ground peculiarly adapted to each.</P>
<P>The only white inhabitants of the i&s;land are &s;ubjects of the King of Great Britain: the&s;e employ &s;laves, who tran&s;port goods of all kinds from place to place on their heads; and we are &s;orry to &s;ay, that the inhumanity of our coun|trymen to the&s;e &s;laves in a di&s;grace to tho&s;e who profe&s;s the chri&s;tian faith. There are a &s;mall number of hor&s;es at St. Helena, but they are never employed in draught, there being no &s;uch thing as a waggon or cart on the i&s;land, though in many places the land is not &s;o &s;teep, but that &s;uch carriages might ea&s;ily be drawn.</P>
<P>Ebony-trees are a natural production of the i&s;land of St. Helena, but there have not been many of them within the memory of any per|&s;on now living there. Snails are found in abun|dance on the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t moun|tains; but the other in&s;ects of the i&s;land are ve|ry few in number.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">On Saturday the 4th of May 1771, the En|deavour &s;ailed from the road of St. Helena, to|gether with the Portland man of war, and &s;e|veral &s;ail of Indiamen. They kept company with the man of war and Indiamen till Friday the 10th. But Captain Cook ob&s;erving, that they were out-&s;ailed by all the other &s;hips, and con&s;equently imagining that &s;ome of them would reach England before him, made &s;ignals to &s;peak with the Portland, when the Captain of that ve&s;&s;el came on board, and received from Captain Cook a letter to the Lords of the Admiralty, together with a box, in which were depo&s;ited the journals of many of the officers, and the &s;hip's log books.</P>
<P>On the 23d they lo&s;t &s;ight of all the &s;hips they &s;ailed in company with from St. Helena, and in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, Mr. Hicks, the fir&s;t Lieutenant, died of a con&s;ump|tion, with which he had been afflicted during the whole voyage.</P>
<P>No &s;ingle occurrence worth recording hap|pened from this time, till the &s;hip came to an anchor in the Downs, which was on the 12th of June following.</P>
<P>Whoever has carefully read, and duly con|&s;idered the wonderful protection of this &s;hip, in ca&s;es of danger the mo&s;t imminent and a&s;to|ni&s;hing, particularly when encircled in the wide ocean with rocks of coral, her &s;heathing beaten off, and her fal&s;e-keel floating by her &s;ide, a hole

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF MONS. DE BOUGAINVILLE's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD, PERFORMED BY ORDER OF THE FRENCH KING, In the years 1766, 1767, 1768, 1769.</HEAD>
<P>A SETTLEMENT having been commen|ced for the French King, on Falkland's I&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

Bougainville was ordered to yield po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands to the Spa|niards.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the orders he had received, he &s;ailed from the port of Mindin on the 15th of November 1766, having under his com|mand the frigate la Boudeu&s;e&mdash;la E&s;meralda,
<PB N="124" REF="126">
and la Liebre; two frigates belonging to Spain, were to join him in the river de la Plata, to the commanding officer of which he was to de|liver the &s;ettlement; and the l'Etoile, a French &s;tore-&s;hip, was to carry him &s;uch provi&s;ions as were nece&s;&s;ary for the long voyage on which he was bound, and to meet him at Falkland's I&s;lands: but the voyage was nece&s;&s;arily &s;everal months longer in compleating than it might have been, on account, as will appear hereafter, of the delay which prevented the l'Etoile from joining Mon&s;. Bougainville.</P>
<P>The Boudeu&s;e had been at &s;ea only two days when &s;he encountered &s;uch a violent &s;torm of wind, as carried away the clue of the fore-&s;ail, broke the top-ma&s;t, and main-top-ma&s;t, and took off the head of the main-ma&s;t. Thus &s;i|tuated, Mon&s;. Bougainville found it nece&s;&s;ary to put into Bre&s;t to refit, and to make &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary alterations in the &s;towage of his &s;hip, which was ill calculated, for with&s;tanding the fury of tho&s;e &s;eas he was to pa&s;s, and particu|larly &s;o for the navigation of the &s;eas round Cape Horn.</P>
<P>And here a reflection will naturally ari&s;e, on that fatality, by which tho&s;e who have the ap|pointment of naval equipments, almo&s;t always de&s;tine for &s;ervices of the mo&s;t imminent danger, ve&s;&s;els totally inadequate for the purpo&s;e. Hence ari&s;e orders and counter-orders, till the proper &s;ea&s;on for performing the mo&s;t hazar|dous
<PB N="125" REF="127">
parts of the voyage, is lo&s;t in the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for making it.</P>
<P>On the 5th of December Mon&s;. Bougain|ville &s;ailed from the harbour of Bre&s;t, having on board the Prince of Na&s;&s;au-Seighen, three gentlemen who went as volunteers, eleven offi|cers in commi&s;&s;ion; and warrant-officers, &s;ea|men, &s;oldiers, &s;ervants and boys, to the num|ber of two hundred.</P>
<P>On the 17th they were in &s;ight of the Sal|vages, a &s;mall flat i&s;land, which at each end ri&s;es into a hillock: the next day they &s;aw the I&s;land of Palma, and that of Ferro on the 19th. Mon&s;. Bougainville was now convinced of a great error in his reckoning, which he attri|butes to the rapidity of the currents oppo&s;ite the Streights of Gibraltar. Having corrected his reckoning, he took a fre&s;h departure, and arrived at Rio de la Plata, without meeting with any thing worthy of notice.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 29th of January they had &s;ight of Rio de la Plata, but as the night was dark and tempe&s;tuous, they lay to, with the head of the ve&s;&s;el towards the offing. The next morning they had a view of the moun|tains of Maldonado, which, after a &s;hip enters the Rio de la Plata, are the fir&s;t high lands &s;een to the north. At the Maldonados the Spani|ards have a &s;mall garri&s;oned town, in the vici|nity of which are picked up &s;ome beautiful tran&s;parent &s;tones; and there is likewi&s;e a gold
<PB N="126" REF="128">
mine near it, which has been worked for a few years pa&s;t, but has yielded little profit.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 31&s;t the Boudeu&s;e came to an anchor in the Bay of Montevideo, where the two Spani&s;h &s;hips, which were to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Falkland's I&s;lands, had been at an|chor for &s;ome weeks.</P>
<P>Don Philip Ruis Puente, the principal in command of the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, having been appointed Governor of the i&s;lands which were to be &s;urrendered by the French, he accompa|nied Mon&s;. Bougainville to Buenos Ayres, to &s;ettle, with the Governor general, the mode of making the ce&s;&s;ion: and the Prince of Na&s;&s;au-Sieghen attended them in this expedition.</P>
<P>The gentlemen made the voyage in a &s;chooner, but a contrary wind preventing their pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, they went on &s;hore above the colony of San Sacramento, and travelled over a prodigi|ous extent of country, in which there were no roads, and where the eye was their only guide. During this expedition they &s;lept in little hovels con&s;tructed with leather, while the tygers howled round them on every &s;ide. Mon&s;. Bougain|ville particularly mentions the manner and the danger of their pa&s;&s;ing the river St. Lucia, which is wide and deep, yet amazingly rapid:&mdash;being placed in a long narrow canoe, one &s;ide of which was beyond all proportion higher than the other, a hor&s;e was fa&s;tened on each &s;ide the ve&s;&s;el, the ma&s;ter of which pulling off

all his cloaths, got into it, and &s;upporting the heads of the hor&s;es above the &s;urface of the &s;tream, drove them acro&s;s it, in the be&s;t man|ner he was able, and, with &s;ome difficulty, they &s;temmed the rapidity of the torrent. It is nece&s;&s;ary for travellers who pa&s;s this wild and exten&s;ive country to be very careful in finding the fordable parts of the rivers; they u&s;ually drive before them a con&s;iderable number of hor&s;es, in order to take fre&s;h ones as often as tho&s;e they ride on are jaded.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Bougainville having tran&s;acted his bu&s;ine&s;s at Buenos Ayres, returned to Monte|video on the 16th of February, and was fol|lowed in a few days by the Spani&s;h Governor, Don Puente. Some nece&s;&s;aries of various kinds being taken on board, the ve&s;&s;els were prepared for &s;ailing to Falkland's I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Our author now gives a long account of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Spaniards in Rio de la Plata, of which we &s;hall take no notice, be|cau&s;e &s;imilar accounts are to be found in a great number of volumes, &s;ome or other of which are in the hands of almo&s;t every reader.</P>
<P>Our voyagers having cau&s;ed a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to be laden with cattle for the u&s;e of the &s;hip's companies, they &s;ailed in company, on the 28th of February 1767, a pilot, acquainted with the coa&s;t of Falkland's I&s;lands, having been previou&s;ly put on board each of the Spani&s;h &s;hips; but this day they were obliged to bring
<PB N="128" REF="131">
their ve&s;&s;els to an anchor, on account of the thickne&s;s of a fog, which prevented their &s;eeing land.</P>
<P>The winds now proving contrary, the &s;hips remained at anchor the following day; but as the current of the river ran &s;trongly in their favour, Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ent to acquaint the Spani&s;h commander, that his ve&s;&s;el being too near the Engli&s;h &s;and-bank, off the i&s;le of Flores, he thought it would be proper to &s;ail on the following day, even if the wind &s;hould not change in their favour. To this the Spani&s;h officer replied, that his pilot re|fu&s;ed to weigh the anchor till the wind became fair and blew &s;teady: on which Don Puente was acquainted, that the anchor of the Boudeu&s;e would certainly be weighed early the next morning, and that &s;he would either anchor more to the north, or ply to the windward, waiting for the Spani&s;h &s;hips, unle&s;s they &s;hould be unavoidably &s;eparated by the violence of the wind.</P>
<P>The &s;mall ve&s;&s;el laden with cattle had not come to an anchor during the preceding night, nor was &s;he &s;een any more during the voyage; but it was afterwards learnt that &s;he went back to Montevideo, after an ab&s;ence of three weeks from that place. The night had been &s;o tem|pe&s;tuous, that all the &s;hips dragged their an|chors, and in the morning the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els were ob&s;erved with their main-yards lowered,
<PB N="129" REF="132">
and their top-ma&s;ts handed: the Boudeu&s;e, however, got under &s;ail, and got out of the river before night, leaving the Spaniards &s;till at anchor. Mon&s;. Bougainville had variable, but chiefly bad, weather till the 23d of the month, when he came to an anchor in the Bay of Falkland's i&s;lands, where the Spani&s;h ve&s;|&s;els al&s;o anchored, on the day following. The&s;e la&s;t had &s;uffered extremely through the inclemency of the weather; the cabbin win|dows of Don Puente's &s;hip had been broke by the violence of the waves, &s;o that the &s;ea for &s;ome time poured into her in torrents; and a number of cattle, de&s;tined for the u&s;e of the colony at Falkland's I&s;land, died on the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April Mon&s;. Bongainville, in the name of the French king, &s;urrendered the i&s;land to Don Puente, who received it for his mo&s;t catholic Maje&s;ty, with the ceremony of hoi&s;ting the Spani&s;h colours, and the firing of guns from the &s;hips and on &s;hore: Mon&s;. Bou|gainville then read a letter, in which his &s;ove|reign granted leave to &s;uch of the inhabitants as cho&s;e to continue their re&s;idence, to be under the dominion of Spain: this offer was accep|ted by &s;ome, while others embarked with the garri&s;on, and were conveyed to Montevideo in the Spani&s;h &s;hips. The whole expence of the French &s;ettlement, to the time of its being delivered to the Spaniards, was &s;ix hundred and three thou&s;and livres; but as his mo&s;t Catholic
<PB N="130" REF="133">
Maje&s;ty took the &s;hips, provi&s;ions, and all the &s;tores of every kind, he reimbur&s;ed this &s;um to France.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to make &s;ome hi&s;torical remarks re&s;pecting Falkland's I&s;lands, in which we &s;hall trace him with all po&s;&s;ible fidelity. He &s;ays that, in the year 1502, when Americo Ve&s;pucius was on his third voyage for the di&s;covery of America, he &s;ailed along the northern coa&s;ts of the i&s;lands, and to him, therefore, he allows the honour of being the fir&s;t di&s;coverer; yet he &s;ays that Ve&s;|pucious knew not whether what he &s;aw was an i&s;land, or a part of the main land. Gouin, a French commander, came to an anchor on the&s;e i&s;lands, in the year 1700, as he was re|turning from a voyage into the South Seas; but Gouin mi&s;took them for Sebald's i&s;les, which he very near them, Falkland's I&s;lands being between tho&s;e, and the i&s;land of Beau|che&s;ne; &s;o that a &s;hip at anchor on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Sebald's i&s;les, is within &s;ight of Falkland's;&mdash;Be&s;ides Beauche&s;ne's de&s;cription of what he took to be Sebald's, exactly an&s;wers to the&s;e: for he &s;ays there are no woods, that the coun+try is &s;wampy, that there are many fre&s;h-water lakes and mar&s;hes on it, and that it abounds in ducks, &s;nipes, wild gee&s;e, and teals.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that Falkland's i&s;lands have been but little known and ill de&s;cribed, till within a few years pa&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="134">
They are commonly repre&s;ented as being co|vered with woods; but this mi&s;take might very well happen in the accounts of tho&s;e who only &s;aw them from on board a &s;hip; for what are taken for woods are tall ru&s;hes, which grow very clo&s;e together, and the &s;talk being dry to the height of five feet from the ground, a large tuft &s;prings from the top of it, &s;o that their number, and the manner in which they grow, form no ill re&s;emblance of a wood. Great part of the hills on the i&s;land are covered with heath, while the ru&s;hes grow only on &s;ome &s;mall i&s;les, and near the &s;ea coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the year 1594 Sir Richard Hawkins had &s;ight of the&s;e i&s;lands, and called them Haw|kins's Maiden-Land: he &s;ays he &s;aw fires on them, and that they were then inhabited: about the commencement of the pre&s;ent century, a French &s;hip, called the St. Louis, came to an anchor on this coa&s;t, under the &s;helter of the i&s;les of Anican, which are &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, &s;o called after the privateer of that name; but the commander of the St. Louis did not think it worth his while to examine the country: yet, Mon&s;. Bougainville ob&s;erves, that the naviga|tors of all nations have remarked how conve|niently they are &s;ituated for affording &s;helter and refre&s;hment to ve&s;&s;els bound to the South-Seas.</P>
<P>France having come to a re&s;olution of &s;end|ing a colony to &s;ettle on Falkland's i&s;lands,
<PB N="132" REF="135">
Mon&s;. Bougainville, towards the beginning of the year 1763, made an offer to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ettlement at his own expence, with the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of two of his near relations, Mon&s;. de Arboulin, and Mon&s;. de Nerville. This offer being accepted, the adventrous French|man gave orders for the building and equip|ment of a ve&s;&s;el of twenty, and another of twelve guns, the former of which was called the Eagle, and the latter the Sphinx: and as &s;oon as the&s;e ve&s;&s;els had taken in &s;uch &s;tores as were nece&s;&s;ary for the voyage, and for mak|ing the &s;ettlement, Mon&s; Bougainville, having previou&s;ly engaged &s;ome acadian families, em|barked his officers, &s;eamen and &s;ettlers, and &s;ailed from the Port of St. Malo, on the 15th of September, 1763.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the voyage he touched on the coa&s;t of Brazil, and at Montevideo, at which la&s;t place he took a number of horned cattle and hor&s;es on board, in order to &s;tock the i&s;land to which he was de&s;tined. On the 31&s;t of January, 1764, Mon&s; Bougainville was within fight of Sebald's i&s;les, and came to an anchor in a large bay on the ea&s;termo&s;t point of Falkland's i&s;lands, on the third of February.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon re&s;olved to form the &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t of this Bay; and Mon&s;. Bougain|ville immediately began to take a &s;urvey of the i&s;land, to learn what it produced, for the &s;upport and convenience of life. He ob&s;erves,
<PB N="133" REF="136">
that various kinds of water and land-fowl, and fi&s;h, were all its edible productions: and that the reader already knows that there grows no wood, either for firing, or other purpo&s;es; but this deficiency, in Mon&s;. Bougainville's opinion, might be tolerably well &s;upplied by an excellent kind of turf, which was almo&s;t every where to be found in great abundance.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t arrival of our adventurers, it was a &s;ight not le&s;s plea&s;ing than a&s;toni&s;hing, to behold the birds flock round them, with evident curio&s;ity, but without the lea&s;t &s;igns of timidity: the&s;e harmle&s;s animals u&s;ed to perch on tho&s;e who were &s;tanding &s;till, and would at all times &s;ubmit to be taken with the hand: but they very &s;oon learnt to be &s;hy of the company of tho&s;e who &s;ought only their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The colony con&s;i&s;ted of nineteen men, five women, and three children; and Mon&s;. Bou|gainville having fixed on the &s;pot for their re|&s;idence, they lo&s;t no time in erecting huts, which they covered with ru&s;hes, to protect them from the inclemency of the weather. They likewi&s;e built a magazine, and erected a &s;mall fort, in the center of which they rai&s;ed an obe|li&s;k, under which they had placed &s;everal pieces of money, and a medal, on one &s;ide of which was the head of the French king, with the following motto; <HI>Tibi &s;erviat ultima thule</HI>; and on the other &s;ide of the medal was an in|&s;cription,
<PB N="134" REF="137">
of which the following is a tran&s;la|tion.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Settlement of the I&s;les Malouines, &s;ituated in 51 degrees 30 minutes of &s;outh latitude, 60 degrees 50 minutes we&s;t longi|tude, from the meridian of Paris, by the Eagle frigate, Captain P.

<P>Mon&s;. de Bougainville having promi&s;ed the &s;ettlers, that he would &s;oon bring them more companions, and give them farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his relation, Mon&s;. de Nerville, agreed to &s;tay till his return from France, as well to be an ho&s;tage for the performance of de Bougain|ville's promi&s;e, as to encourage the young co|loni&s;ts, by participating in every hard&s;hip and danger to which they might be expo&s;ed, in a &s;tation &s;o far removed from all communication with the re&s;t of mankind. In return for Mon&s;.
<PB N="135" REF="138">
de Nerville's kind compliance with the wi&s;h of the &s;ettlers, he was to be con&s;idered as their Governor.</P>
<P>On the 8th of April 1764, Mon&s;. Bougain|ville weighed his anchor, and &s;ailed for Eu|rope, having fir&s;t taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands, in the name, and for the u&s;e of his mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1765, Mon&s;. Bou|gainville again vi&s;ited Falkland's I&s;lands, where he found the &s;ettlers in good health, and plea&s;ed with their &s;ituation. After he had debarked the &s;tores which he had brought for their u&s;e, he &s;ailed to the Streights of Magellan, where he took in timber and palli&s;adoes, and a number of young trees for planting on Falkland's I&s;lands; which place he again left on the 27th of April, when the whole number of coloni&s;ts was only twenty-four.</P>
<P>While Mon&s;ieur de Bougainville was on the above-mentioned expedition in the Streights of Magellan, he &s;aw the &s;hips under Commodore Byron's command; the reader will recol|lect this circum&s;tance, in the account of Mr. Byron's Voyage, related in the twenty-fir&s;t page of the preceding volume.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts on Falkland's I&s;lands were en|crea&s;ed to about one hundred and fifty, by a number of fre&s;h &s;ettlers, which &s;ailed from France in the Eagle, in the year 1765. This &s;hip was accompanied by the Etode &s;tore-&s;hip,
<PB N="136" REF="139">
which carried provi&s;ions to the i&s;land. By this time the Governor, and an officer who took care of the &s;tores, had good hou&s;es built of &s;tone, and the re&s;t of the coloni&s;ts were lodged in commodious huts, having walls compo&s;ed of &s;ods of earth. With the wood which Mon&s;. Bougainville had brought from the Streights of Magellan, they had built &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, adapted to examine the coa&s;ts of the i&s;land; and three magazines were by this time erected, in which to depo&s;it the public and private &s;tores; &s;everal kinds of grain which had been brought from France grew very well, and pro|mi&s;ed a &s;ufficient encrea&s;e; and &s;ome train-oil had been made, and &s;eals-&s;kins turned, by the &s;ettlers, with which the Eagle was loaded, and returned to France.</P>
<P>In the year 1766, when an Engli&s;h colony had &s;ettled at Port Egmont, Captain Macbride, of the Ja&s;on frigate, vi&s;ited the French &s;ettle|ment, and, to u&s;e Mon&s;. Bougainville's own words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"pretended that tho&s;e parts belonged to his Britannic Maje&s;ty, threatened to land by force, if he &s;hould be any longer denied that liberty, vi&s;ited the Governor, and &s;ailed away again the &s;ame day."</Q></P>
<P>The above, according to Bougainville's ac|count, was the &s;tate of Falkland's i&s;lands, when the French &s;urrendered them to Spain; and he pretends, that the prior claim of Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">in was con|firmed by &s;uch &s;urrender of tho&s;e who had made
<PB N="137" REF="140">
the fir&s;t &s;ettlement: and perhaps there might be &s;ome force in this reckoning, if the prior claim of Spain was founded in ju&s;tice, and warranted by the laws which have hitherto di|rected the di&s;coverers of unknown countries. An Engli&s;hman, however, will be glad to &s;ee this argument &s;tated in its proper light, by which it will appear, that the right to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e i&s;lands, is undoubtedly ve&s;ted in the Crown of the&s;e realms.</P>
<P>The plain &s;tate of facts, then, is as follows: as early as the voyage under Sir Thomas Ca|vendi&s;h, in the year 1592, Captain Davis had &s;ight of the&s;e i&s;lands: they were &s;een a &s;econd time, in 1594, as before-mentioned by Sir Ri|chard Hawkins, who gave them the name of Hawkins's Maiden Land: the third per&s;on who &s;aw them was the Dutch voyager Sebald de Waert, who called them Sebald's I&s;les, and under this name they are laid down in the Dutch charts. In the year 1683 they were &s;een by Dampier, and, in 1689, by Strong, who gave them their pre&s;ent Engli&s;h name of Falk|land I&s;lands, which Dr. Halley, the celebrated a&s;tronomer, adopting, they are now &s;o called in all the maps and charts of this country. Dur|ing the reign of William and Mary, the Eng|li&s;h privateers often &s;aw the&s;e i&s;lands, whereas, according to Mon&s;. Bougainville's own account, the fir&s;t Frenchman who ever &s;aw them was Gouin, no longer ago than the year 1700.
<PB N="138" REF="141">
From this &s;tate of the evidence it does not ap|pear, that the Spaniards vi&s;ited them at all, and that the French were the la&s;t vi&s;itors; yet would Mon&s;. Bougainville have his readers be|lieve, that the Spaniards have the prior claim to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that this claim has been ratified by the French!&mdash;This rea&s;oning may &s;ound admirably well in the ears of the &s;laves of two arbitrary monarchs, but will be equally ridiculed and contemned by every &s;en&s;ible &s;ub|ject of our happier, becau&s;e limited, monarchy.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Bougainville now proceeds to give an account of the natural hi&s;tory of, and other particulars re&s;pecting, Falkland's I&s;lands, which, he &s;ays, are the re&s;ult of the ob&s;ervations of his kin&s;man, Mon&s;. de Nerville, who re&s;ided at the &s;ettlement three years. The picture our ingenious voyager gives of the fir&s;t appearance of the i&s;lands is very &s;triking, and his argu|ments for and again&s;t &s;ettling them are very conclu&s;ive. On their fir&s;t arrival not an object &s;truck their view, except the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of the port in which the &s;hip lay, which could tempt them to take up their re&s;idence on &s;o in|ho&s;pitable a &s;hore. The land was in many places broke in upon by the &s;ea; the mountains, unclothed with wood, had the mo&s;t barren ap|pearance; the fields looked dreary for want of hou&s;es and inhabitants; an univer&s;al &s;ilence reigned, except when the howling of &s;ome &s;ea-mon&s;ter di&s;turbed the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s; while
<PB N="139" REF="142">
a dull and gloomy &s;amene&s;s of appearance added horror to the whole picture.</P>
<P>Di&s;couraging as this &s;cene appeared, our ad|venturers knew that all would yield to time and diligence, and that the labour of the indu&s;tri|ous would not go unrequited: indeed &s;ome con|&s;olation aro&s;e in their brea&s;ts, on viewing the place in a more favourable light. The climate had that kind of temperature likely to afford health, &s;trength, and long life, and was there|fore preferable to the noxious air of tho&s;e re|gions where the &s;ickening inhabitant faints un|der the &s;corching heat of the vertical &s;un: the i&s;land produced a number of plants, admirable in the cure of the &s;curvy, and other di&s;orders incident to the &s;ailor's life. The fi&s;h and the birds were mo&s;t exqui&s;itely delicious, and there were amphibious animals in immen&s;e numbers, while there were none of the fierce or the poi|&s;onous kind. Ca&s;cades and rivulets fell from the mountains, which at the &s;ame time &s;helter|ed the fi&s;herman from the violence of the winds, &s;o that he could &s;port or labour in the &s;pacious bay, in perfect &s;ecurity: meadows of an im|men&s;e extent promi&s;ed con&s;tant pa&s;turage for any number of flocks and herds, which might feed at plea&s;ure, undi&s;turbed by any tyrant lord of the &s;oil. The&s;e various advantages, in the opinion of our adventurers, were &s;ufficient to recompence them for the dangers and fatigue
<PB N="140" REF="143">
of the voyage, and a pledge for the full reward of their future labours.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Falkland's I&s;lands is between fifty-one and fifty-two degrees and a half of &s;outh latitude, and &s;ixty-five degrees and a half of we&s;t longitude from Paris. From the en|trance of the Streights of Magellan, and from the coa&s;t of Patagonia, their di&s;tance is about 250 miles.</P>
<P>The harbours are large, and well defended by &s;mall i&s;lands mo&s;t happily di&s;po&s;ed; and even the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els may ride in &s;afety in the creeks: while fre&s;h water is ea&s;ily to be obtained, as the &s;mall rivers which de&s;cend from the mountains di&s;charge them&s;elves into the &s;ea. The tides do not ri&s;e and fall at any &s;tated times, but depend on the force with which the wind agitates the waves of the &s;ea; it was, however, ob&s;erved, that ju&s;t before high water, the &s;ea ri&s;es and &s;ub&s;ides, with a quick motion, three times within the &s;pace of fifteen minutes; and that at the full of the moon, and during the equinoxes and &s;ol&s;tices, this mo|tion is much greater than at any other time.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e winds that blow from between the &s;outh and we&s;t, and the north and we&s;t points, prevail more than others; but in general the winds vary as in mo&s;t other countries. In &s;um|mer time the winds u&s;ually blow from &s;ome point between the north-we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t. It is remarkable, that the&s;e winds ri&s;e with the
<PB N="141" REF="144">
ri&s;ing &s;un, encrea&s;e in force as the &s;un advances to the meridian, blow mo&s;t violently ju&s;t at noon, decrea&s;e again with the declining &s;un, and totally cea&s;e about the time of its &s;etting. The tides al&s;o frequently add to the violence of the&s;e winds, and not unfrequently change their direction.</P>
<P>The blowing of the winds in winter is a cer|tain indication of the weather. If they come from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, they are not &s;o violent as the &s;ummer winds from the &s;ame quarter; but they are accompanied with &s;light fogs. When they blow between the &s;outh and we&s;t points, hoar fro&s;t, hail and &s;now, are the certain con|&s;equences; and the weather is wet and foggy, when they come from the points between the north and the we&s;t. The &s;now which comes with the &s;outh and we&s;t winds is but &s;mall in quantity, and commonly di&s;appears from the ground in a day or two, except what lodges on the &s;ummits of the high mountains, where it will remain about two months. The running &s;treams are never frozen, and the lakes and &s;tagnate-pools have &s;eldom been covered with ice &s;trong enough to bear the weight of a man two days together. In the &s;pring and autumn there are &s;light hoar fro&s;ts, which being chang|ed to a kind of dew by the warmth of the &s;un, are rather nutrimental than prejudicial to the vegetable productions. There is &s;eldom any thunder or lightning, nor is the climate hot or
<PB N="142" REF="145">
cold in any extraordinary degree. Throughout the year the nights are, in general, &s;tar-light, &s;erene, and fair; and, upon the whole, the climate is very favourable to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The fre&s;h water of the&s;e i&s;lands is extremely good, and in great plenty: the beds of &s;ome of the rivers are a kind of tuft, which gives a yel|lowi&s;h ca&s;t to the water, yet does not affect its ta&s;te; but the bottom of mo&s;t of the rivers is either &s;and or gravel.</P>
<P>The depth of the &s;oil in the vallies is more than &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of plowing; but, before our adventurers could proceed to cultiva|tion, they were obliged to extract the roots of plants, which every where inter&s;ected and choak|ed up the ground for near a foot deep: the&s;e roots they dried and burnt, and they then made a rich manure for the ground from which they had been cleared. Under the fir&s;t land is a layer of black earth, ten inches or more in depth; under that again a yellow &s;oil, beneath which are &s;tones and &s;late; but the&s;e &s;tones are not found on the little adjacent i&s;lands. The &s;ea-coa&s;t is, in mo&s;t places, compo&s;ed of &s;tones, which are very fit for the purpo&s;es of building; and there are beds of a hard fine grained &s;tone, in &s;everal &s;pots on the i&s;land; likewi&s;e another kind of &s;tones, in which are particles of tale. Our &s;ettlers found a kind of &s;tone which &s;plit in pieces ea&s;ily, and with which they made grind-&s;tones, to give an edge to their in&s;tru|ments.
<PB N="143" REF="146">
In the quarries they met with a &s;tone of a yellowi&s;h hue, which, when fir&s;t taken out, was &s;o &s;oft as to be cut with a knife; but it &s;oon grew hard when expo&s;ed to the open air. The i&s;land likewi&s;e yeilded earth fit for making bricks and potters-ware, and plenty of &s;and and clay.</P>
<P>In many parts of the country there are mar&s;hy places, which produce a &s;ort of ru&s;hes with &s;harp points, the remains of the roots of which being continually wa&s;ting, form the turf that was u&s;ed for firing, which burnt exceeding well, and had nothing offen&s;ive in its &s;mell.</P>
<P>A plant of the gramen kind grows on a &s;talk which has a &s;weeti&s;h flavour, and is extremely nutrimental for cattle, who like it better than any other kind of pa&s;turage. This plant flouri&s;hes on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, and on the little i&s;les, where it bends till the &s;talks unite, forming a kind of harbour, to which the &s;ea-lions and the &s;eals oc|ca&s;ionally retreat. Our adventurers, in &s;everal excur&s;ions, found the&s;e natural built hou&s;es, a very agreeable defence again&s;t the inclemency of the weather, and the more &s;o, as the dry leaves which had fallen off formed a bed, by no means to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The above mentioned plant is the large&s;t that grows on the i&s;land, which likewi&s;e pro|duces many &s;hrubs that were very u&s;eful in heating ovens, and other purpo&s;es of firing. A kind of heath, which grows in great plenty,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
bears a red fruit, which is eaten by the fowls and birds.</P>
<P>A plant was di&s;covered which re&s;embles a &s;hrub, but having been ta&s;ted, it was thought fit for the brewing of beer: happily our colo|ni&s;ts were &s;upplied with malt and mola&s;&s;es, to which they added the beer-plant, and were en|abled at all times to brew a very whole&s;ome kind of &s;pruce-beer, which was an admirable &s;pecific for the &s;curvy. This plant was likewi&s;e infu&s;ed in water, in which tho&s;e who had con|tracted any illne&s;s, while out at &s;ea, bathed them&s;elves, and it was found to be a fine re&s;to|rative: when pre&s;&s;ed, it yeilded a mealy &s;ub|&s;tance, of a fragrant &s;mell, and a glutinous na|ture: the leaves of this plant are &s;mall, of a clear bright green, and dentated.</P>
<P>Other vegetables in abundance were found, which were u&s;ed as anti&s;corbutics; particularly water-cre&s;&s;es, &s;orrel, wild par&s;ley, a kind of maiden-hair, and a &s;pecies of celery.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary vegetable pro|duction of Falkland's I&s;lands, is a kind of re|&s;inous gum-plant, of which we &s;hall &s;peak more particularly, as it is wholly unknown in the&s;e parts of the globe. Though this is called a plant, it is without leaves, branches, or any apparent &s;talk; and, except in colour, which is that of a bright green, it more re&s;embles a lump of earth ri&s;ing from the common &s;urface of the ground. It does not grow to the height of
<PB N="145" REF="148">
more than eighteen inches, and its breadth in different plants is from two feet to two yards and upwards: the &s;maller plants have the form of an hemi&s;phere, and their circumference is regular; but when they come to the full &s;ize, they terminate in irregular bunches and hollows: there are drops of a tough yellow matter, as big as a pea, on different parts of its &s;urface, which &s;mell like turpentine. Mon&s;. Bougain|ville having cut this plant clo&s;e to the ground, found that it aro&s;e from a &s;talk, from which grew an immen&s;e number of &s;hoots, con&s;i&s;t|ing of leaves re&s;embling &s;tars, laying one within the other. The out&s;ides of the&s;e &s;hoots, which are expo&s;ed to the air, are green, and the in&s;ides white: they contain a vi&s;cid milky juice, which is likewi&s;e found in the roots and the &s;talk. The roots extending horizontally, fre|quently produce fre&s;h &s;hoots at a di&s;tance, &s;o that there is no in&s;tance of one of the&s;e plants being found alone. The re&s;in of this plant was found to be a good medicine for the cure of &s;light wounds; but this re&s;in was often wa&s;hed away by the rains, or wa&s;ted by the in|fluence of the air; yet, however contradictory it may appear, it would not di&s;&s;olve except in &s;pirits: &s;ome of the &s;eeds were brought to Eu|rope, in order to attempt the cultivation of &s;o &s;ingular a curio&s;ity in the vegetable world.</P>
<P>The i&s;land on which our coloni&s;ts had taken up their re&s;idence is divided from ea&s;t to we&s;t

by a chain of hills, to the &s;outh of which they found another plant, not unlike the re&s;inous gum-plant, which, however, did not yield any re&s;in, but produced beautiful yellow flowers; neither was it of &s;o firm a texture, nor was its green of the &s;ame &s;hade; yet, in other re&s;pects, the re&s;emblance was very &s;trong. On the hills was found a &s;pecies of Maiden-hair, which grew to a great height, and the leaves of it were &s;haped like the blade of a &s;word. The hills like|wi&s;e abounded with various kinds of plants, which had the appearance of holding a middle &s;ta|tion between &s;tones and vegetables. It was ap|prehended, that the&s;e might have been &s;ucce&s;s|fully u&s;ed in dying, and our coloni&s;ts propo&s;ed to have made the experiment if they had re|mained longer on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The place produces flowers in a con&s;iderable variety, but only one of them has any &s;mell, which is like that of a tubero&s;e; this flower is perfectly white. A true violet was &s;een, which was of a regular light yellow colour.</P>
<P>A fruit was found, of the &s;ize of a pea, which received the name of the lucet, from its re&s;emblance to the North American fruit of that name: its colour is white, but the &s;ide which is expo&s;ed to the &s;un changes to a red: it has the &s;mell of orange-blo&s;&s;oms, and a very agreeable flavour: its branches, which creep along the ground, produce leaves of dark green, which are round and &s;hining, and the&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="150">
leaves infu&s;ed into milk give it a delicious ta&s;te: the flowers grow in large numbers on the bor|ders of lakes, and the plant delights in a moi&s;t &s;oil. Be&s;ides the lucet only one other fruit was found, which grows on long branches, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;trawberry, but it has the appearance of a mulberry, which name it re|ceived, and its leaves are like tho&s;e of the hornbeam.</P>
<P>Our coloni&s;ts found but few &s;ea-plants which they could apply to any u&s;e; but all the coa&s;t of the harbour was lined with &s;ea-weeds, which were &s;erviceable in breaking the force of the waves in &s;tormy weather. Many kinds of co|ralines, of various beautiful colours, and a great number of curious &s;hells and &s;punges were wa&s;hed on &s;hore by the force of the tides. Among the &s;hells were the &s;mooth and &s;triated mu&s;cle, &s;callops, whelks, and a bivalve &s;hell, of a very &s;ingular kind, named <HI>la Poulette.</HI></P>
<P>Sea lions and &s;eals are the only amphibious animals found in the&s;e parts; but there are great varieties of fi&s;h on the coa&s;ts, &s;carce any of which are known in Europe. It &s;ometimes happens that the whales, getting too near the &s;hore, are &s;tranded in the bays, where their re|mains have been &s;een. Bones of great mag|nitude have been found far up the country, where the force of the waters could not have conveyed them, which Mon&s;. Bougainville
<PB N="148" REF="151">
deems a proof that the &s;oil is encrea&s;ed, or the &s;ea dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The only quadruped found on Falkland's i&s;land is of a &s;pecies between the fox and the wolf, and our author therefore calls him the wolf-fox: the tail of this animal is more bu&s;hy than that of the wolf, and he lives in a kennel which he digs in the ground, on the downs by the &s;ea-&s;ide. At one time of the year the wolf-fox is &s;o lean as to appear almo&s;t &s;tarved, from whence it is imagined that he fa&s;ts for a con&s;ide|rable time: he is about as large as a &s;heep-dog, and barks very much like one, only that his yelp is not &s;o loud. He &s;ub&s;i&s;ts principally on wild fowl, in &s;earch of which he travels in &s;uch a direct line from one day to another, that when our adventurers fir&s;t beheld his track, they ima|gined that the i&s;land was inhabited, and that the natives had made the path. Mon&s;. Bougain|ville makes it a matter of wonder how the wolf-fox can have been conveyed to the&s;e i&s;lands, without con&s;idering, that land-animals having got on large pieces of ice, which being broken by the &s;ea, they have frequently been conveyed to places very remote from tho&s;e of their fir&s;t re&s;idence. The circum&s;tance of ice &s;o broken from the &s;hore is not uncommon on the coa&s;t of Greenland.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands and their coa&s;ts produce land and water-fowls in incredible numbers, many of which are the prey of falcons, hawks, ea|gles
<PB N="149" REF="152">
and owls; while the eggs and the young birds are de&s;troyed by the wolf-fox.&mdash;The &s;mal|ler fi&s;h are de&s;troyed by the whales, the am|phibious animals, and the voracious birds, &s;ome of which are con&s;tantly flying clo&s;e over the &s;urface of the waters, while others perch them&s;elves on the rocks to watch the event.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a de|&s;cription of &s;uch birds as were found on the i&s;lands, which could be applied to any kind of u&s;e, omitting tho&s;e that could not be rendered &s;erviceable to the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;wan is perfectly white, except its feet and its neck, the former of which are of a fle&s;h-colour, and the latter as black as jet.</P>
<P>Of wild gee&s;e there are four kinds, only one of which feeds on dry ground. It has very high legs, and a neck of great length: its flight is much more free than that of the Engli&s;h goo&s;e; it walks with equal ea&s;e, and does not cackle like the common goo&s;e. The feathers of the male are white except on the wings, which have a mixture of a&s;h-colour and black: the wings of the female are of various colours; and its body is yellow. It &s;eldom lays more than &s;ix eggs. The flavour of the&s;e birds is agreeable, and they were found to be very nu|tritious: exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e which are hatched on the i&s;land, large flocks fly thither with a we&s;terly wind which blows in the autumn, &s;o that they were generally to be taken in great
<PB N="150" REF="153">
abundance, and formed a principal part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the &s;ettlers. Tho&s;e which came in the autumn were ea&s;ily known from tho&s;e re&s;ident on the i&s;land, by their not being &s;hy.</P>
<P>The other three kinds are of various colours; yellow, white, black, and a&s;h-colour; they are not by far &s;o beautiful as tho&s;e above de|&s;cribed: and as they live entirely on fi&s;h, their fle&s;h acquires a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te; one of the&s;e three &s;pecies &s;eldom ri&s;es from the &s;urface of the water, and is almo&s;t con&s;tantly making a very di&s;agreeable noi&s;e. A &s;oft thick down, either grey or white, grows under the feathers of all the&s;e gee&s;e, as it does likewi&s;e under tho&s;e of the &s;wan.</P>
<P>The rivers and ponds of Falkland's i&s;lands abound in teals of two &s;pecies, and two of wild ducks: of the latter &s;ome are perfectly white, and others totally black, but in other re&s;pects they re&s;emble tho&s;e of England and France. The&s;e birds are all exqui&s;ite fine food, and to be procured in any numbers. One kind of the teal is very &s;mall; but the other is as large as the duck, and its bill is blue. The bellies of &s;ome of them are al&s;o covered with feathers of a fle&s;h-colour.</P>
<P>The i&s;land produces a bird which Mon&s;. Bougainville calls the Diver, but, from the de&s;cription he gives of it, it is conjectured to be the Grebe, which abounds on the lake of Geneva, and of the &s;kin of which the mo&s;t
<PB N="151" REF="154">
elegant muffs and tippets are made. Of the&s;e Divers there are two kinds, of which the mo&s;t plentiful has brown feathers, with no other variation than that the feathers on the belly are of a &s;omewhat lighter colour than tho&s;e on the back. The belly of the other kind is white, and the back grey; and the feathers on the belly are very thick, &s;hining and &s;oft. The eyes of the&s;e birds are as bright as rubies, and are encircled with a ring of white feathers. The female hatches only two young birds at a time, which &s;he carries on her back, not &s;ub|jecting them to the coldne&s;s of the water, till feathers have taken place of the down with which they are hatched. The toes of this bird are thin, and of a green colour, and being round towards the claw, they are not unlike the leaves of &s;ome plants: their feet are not webbed, as is common among water-fowl, but their toes are &s;eparate, having a &s;trong mem|brane on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts gave the name of Saw-bills to two kinds of birds which bore a great &s;imilitude to each other, the chief difference con&s;i&s;ting in their &s;ize, and in the bellies of mo&s;t of them being white, while a few were ob&s;erved to have brown feathers on the belly: the feathers on the re&s;t of the body are of a dark blue, as &s;oft as &s;ilk, and grow very clo&s;e together. Their feet are webbed and fle&s;h coloured, and their bills pointed: they lay their eggs on the rocks,
<PB N="152" REF="155">
where great numbers of them live together; and they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on fi&s;h, thou&s;ands of which they de&s;troy. Our &s;ettlers not only ate the eggs of the&s;e birds, but frequently killed many &s;cores of them at a time, and their fle&s;h was found to be excellent food. They had &s;o little apprehen&s;ion of being catched, that it was an ea&s;y matter to knock them down with a &s;tick, and in this manner they were u&s;ually taken. A bird called by the Spaniards <HI>Quebrantahu|e&s;&s;os,</HI> which mea&s;ures more than two yards from the extremity of its wings, de&s;troys the &s;aw-bills. This bird of prey has a long bill, with two hollow tubes of the &s;ame kind of &s;ub&s;tance as the bill, and its feet are webbed: &s;ome of the &s;eamen called this bird the Albatro&s;s, but it differs con&s;iderably from the common bird of that name, nor is it an ea&s;y matter to deter|mine preci&s;ely on its &s;pecies, from the imper|fect account which Mon&s;. Bougainville has given of it.</P>
<P>Gulls, mews, and terns, of different beau|tiful plumage, &s;erved to direct our coloni&s;ts what was the proper time for taking of pil|chards. The&s;e birds, flying in large flocks over the &s;urface of the water, dart on the pilchard and &s;wallow it; pre&s;ently they catch another of the&s;e fi&s;h, and then they di&s;gorge the one which had been previou&s;ly &s;wallowed, and &s;o on. When the pilchards are not in &s;ea&s;on, they feed on various other &s;orts of &s;mall fi&s;h. The eggs
<PB N="153" REF="156">
of the&s;e birds were found in great abundance upon the leaves of a plant, on the borders of the mar&s;hes, and they proved to be very good eating.</P>
<P>Three kinds of penguins breed on the i&s;land, one of the&s;e is a remarkably grand and elegant bird, the belly of which is a clear white, the back a kind of blue, and it has a ruff round its neck near the head, of a bright yellow, which de&s;cending towards the belly, &s;eparates the white feathers from the blue ones; the&s;e birds do not live together in numbers, but &s;eek the mo&s;t quiet and retired places of abode. One of them being caught, with an intention of being brought to France, &s;oon grew &s;o tame, that it followed the per&s;on who fed it; its food was bread, fi&s;h and fle&s;h; but there was &s;ome|thing more wanting for its &s;u&s;tenance, for it gradually lo&s;t its fatne&s;s till it died. The &s;e|cond kind of penguin an&s;wers to the de&s;crip|tion of that bird in An&s;on's voyage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This de&s;cription will, of cour&s;e, be found when we come to give an account of that voyage.</NOTE>. The third kind of penguins lay their eggs among the high cliffs of the rocks, where they re&s;ide together in immen&s;e numbers, never &s;eeking that &s;olitude of which the fir&s;t kind are &s;o fond. They are much &s;maller than the others, and were named hopping penguins, from their method of moving, which is very much like
<PB N="154" REF="157">
hopping; they have gold-coloured feathers, which form a kind of eye-brows, and a tuft of the &s;ame colour, which they rai&s;e when they are di&s;plea&s;ed. This bird has a very chearful look, and its general colour is a deep yellow.</P>
<P>At different times, but not frequently, three kinds of petrels were &s;een by our adventurers. The&s;e birds build their ne&s;ts on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, where their young were &s;ometimes found, co|vered with down. One &s;ort of them is quite white, their bills red, and not unlike a pigeon a &s;econd &s;ort is larger, and the third &s;maller than the pigeon; and the&s;e two &s;orts have white feathers on the belly, while every other part of the body is black.</P>
<P>Eagles were al&s;o &s;een of three different &s;pe|cies, two of which are black, with white and yellow feet, and the other is of a dull white: all the&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;t on &s;nipes, and other &s;mall birds, which they &s;eize every opportunity to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Egrets, a &s;pecies of the heron, were fre|quently &s;een on the i&s;land: they make a di&s;a|greeable noi&s;e, not much unlike the barking of a little dog; and they never take any food till towards the evening.</P>
<P>Two kinds of the thru&s;h came regularly to the i&s;land in the autumnal months, one of which was of the &s;ame colour as the Euro|pean thru&s;h; and the other yellow, except on the belly, which was &s;potted with black. There was a third kind of thru&s;h, which lived
<PB N="155" REF="158">
on the i&s;land throughout the year, the feathers on the belly of which are of a bright red: this was called the Red-bird, and though Mon&s;. Bougainville ranks it among the thru&s;hes, it is probably no other than the red-brea&s;t of A|merica.</P>
<P>A bird which they called the Sea-pie, was con&s;tantly &s;een on the coa&s;ts, the feet of which were white, the bill red, and the feathers black and white. This bird whi&s;tles a kind of note, which the coloni&s;ts found it ea&s;y to imitate, and by that means they came near enough to catch them without much trouble: they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on &s;hrimps, which they pick up after the ebb|ing of the tide.&mdash;Such is Mon&s;. Bougainville's de&s;cription of the &s;ea-pie; but if it be the true bird of that kind, oy&s;ters form a part of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; for when the tide is out, the&s;e fi&s;h are left on the &s;and, and the &s;ea-pie, forcing open the &s;hell with his bill, &s;wallows the oy&s;ter; whence he is al&s;o called oy&s;ter-catcher.</P>
<P>Great numbers of curlews, the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Europe, were con&s;tantly &s;een in the &s;um|mer; and &s;nipes of the European kind were found in abundance. It is ea&s;y to &s;hoot the&s;e birds, as they fly in a regular manner. At the time when they are breeding, they a&s;cend to a great height, and having &s;ung &s;ome time in the air, they drop at once into their ne&s;ts, which are built on the ground, in the open field, where it is mo&s;t free from gra&s;s or other her|bage,
<PB N="156" REF="159">
&s;o that the&s;e ne&s;ts are very ea&s;ily found: the &s;nipes are excellent food if dre&s;&s;ed towards the decline of the year; but in the breeding &s;ea&s;on they are lean, and not &s;o fit to eat.</P>
<P>The amphibious animals of Falkland's i&s;lands are &s;eals and &s;ea-lions, which having been be|fore-mentioned, and being de&s;cribed in many books of voyages, we &s;hall only add, that they frequently travel in very numerous companies three or four miles up the country, to fea&s;t on the herbs, and repo&s;e them&s;elves in the warmth of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Of the fi&s;h which were found on the coa&s;ts of Falkland's i&s;lands, one that was taken in the greate&s;t plenty was called the Mullet, from the likene&s;s it bears to the European fi&s;h of that name: the coloni&s;ts dried many of the&s;e, which were full a yard in length: the &s;eals prey on the&s;e fi&s;h whenever they can catch them; but, by a natural in&s;tinct, they are taught to avoid the&s;e voracious enemies, by &s;heltering them|&s;elves in holes, among &s;limy ground, on the banks of the rivers, and in the&s;e places they were frequently taken. A fi&s;h called the <HI>gra|deau,</HI> about twelve inches in length, was found in great abundance; and another, named the <HI>&s;ardine,</HI> was found only at the commencement of the winter &s;ea&s;on. Some white porpoi&s;es were taken in the bays, when the weather was fair, and &s;ome eels in tho&s;e cavities of the rocks which were filled with water. A fre&s;h
<PB N="157" REF="160">
water fi&s;h was found, about the &s;ize of a trout, without &s;cales, the colour of which was green. Many &s;maller fi&s;h were catched with the hook and line, among them was one &s;pe|cies, the head of which re&s;embled that of a pike, and it had no &s;cales: a few &s;oals were found; and Mon&s;. Bougainville is of opinion, that a greater number of tho&s;e, and many other differ|ent kinds of fi&s;h, might have been procured, if there had been hands &s;ufficient to have con|&s;tantly &s;pared a proper number to attend the &s;ea-fi&s;hery. The &s;hell-fi&s;h found at this place were mu&s;cles, a very &s;mall kind of &s;hrimp, a crab, the feet of which were blue, and a kind of cray-fi&s;h, or prawn, the colour of which was naturally red, without boiling: but our au|thor &s;ays, the&s;e were only taken through curio|&s;ity, as their ta&s;te was much inferior to tho&s;e European fi&s;h which are nearly of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The above is a faithful detail of the natural hi&s;tory of Falkland's i&s;lands, as far as it could be learnt by the French &s;ettlers, during a re&s;i|dence of three years; if they had continued longer in the country, there is no doubt but that their di&s;coveries would have been greater, and their account more accurate: from &s;uch as it is, however, it will probably be thought, by the Engli&s;h reader, that the&s;e i&s;lands are by no means &s;o barren and inho&s;pitable a &s;pot, as our mini&s;terial writers took the pains to repre&s;ent
<PB N="158" REF="161">
them, as &s;oon as it was known, that our people in power had formed the di&s;graceful re&s;olution of permitting the prior claim of England to this exten&s;ive country, to yeild to the imperious de|mand of the haughty Spaniards.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, indeed, appear evident to the un|prejudiced view of the intelligent reader, that the&s;e i&s;lands might, in the cour&s;e of a few years, be made a very valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: as they abound in fowl and fi&s;h of various u&s;eful kinds, while their amphibious animals, the &s;ea-lions and &s;eals, would yeild a quantity of grea&s;e and train-oil, which might make no incon&s;ide|rable articles of commerce; and what a&s;toni&s;h|ing crops of wheat, barley, and every kind of European grain might not be rai&s;ed on a tract of land that is many hundred miles in extent! It is true the i&s;lands do not naturally produce any trees; but it would be ea&s;y to carry thither the &s;eeds of &s;ome, and young trees of other kinds; and there is no doubt, but that they would flouri&s;h in a country &s;ituated, with regard to the &s;outh pole, nearly as Ireland is with re|gard to the north.</P>
<P>As true Engli&s;hmen, we cannot help expre&s;|&s;ing a wi&s;h that the day may yet arrive, when &s;ome State&s;man of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit may re-urge and in&s;i&s;t on the right of Great Britain, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Falkland's i&s;lands. The reader will excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion, and prepare to at|tend

Mon&s;. Bougainville in the cour&s;e of his voyage.</P>
<P>After waiting at the&s;e i&s;lands till the 2d of June 1767, in expectation of the Etoile &s;tore-&s;hip, and finding that &s;he did not arrive, Mon&s;. Bougainville con&s;idered, that as his ve&s;&s;el would hold no more than &s;ix months provi&s;ions, and that he had only two on board, it would be an act of ra&s;hne&s;s to attempt the cro&s;&s;ing the great pacific ocean alone; he therefore re&s;olved to &s;teer to Rio Janeiro, at which place he had ap|pointed the Etoile to join him, in ca&s;e any un|fore&s;een accident &s;hould prevent her reaching Falkland's i&s;lands before he left the harbour of that place.</P>
<P>They had fine weather from the 2d till the 20th of June, on which day they had &s;ight of the mountains on the main land of Bra&s;il; and they &s;aw the entrance of Rio Janeiro on the day following. A number of fi&s;hing-boats be|ing ob&s;erved near the &s;hore, Mon&s;. Bougain|ville hoi&s;ted Portugue&s;e colours, and ordered a cannon to be fired; on which a boat put off to the &s;hip, and a pilot was engaged to conduct her into the road.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of this country is broken by a number of &s;mall hills, which &s;erve to give an agreeable variety to the pro&s;pect. The country is rather mountainous, and well cloth|ed with woods.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163">The &s;hip having arrived off the Port of San|ta Cruz, a Portugue&s;e officer was &s;ent to en|quire the rea&s;on of her &s;ailing into it; on which Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ent one of his officers to acquaint the Viceroy of the Bra&s;ils, with the motives for his touching there, and to enquire whether if he &s;hould &s;alute the fort, the com|pliment would be returned.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which the French officer receiv|ed from Count d'Acunha, marks that &s;ingular haughtine&s;s and arrogance, for which &s;ome of the Portugue&s;e Governors are not a little fa|mous:&mdash;the Count &s;aid, that when a per&s;on bowed to another whom he might ca&s;ually meet in the &s;treet, he was not previou&s;ly certain that his compliment would be returned, and that if Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;hould fire his guns by way of &s;alute, he (the Viceroy) had then to con&s;ider what was proper to be done. As this an&s;wer was by no means &s;atisfactory to Mon&s;. Bougainville, he, with that &s;pirit of pride becoming a gentleman and an officer, di&s;dained to fire a &s;ingle gun.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time a canoe was di&s;patched from the Captain of the Etoile, to inform Mon&s;. Bougainville of the &s;afe arrival of that ve&s;&s;el, which now lay in the port. The Com|mander, Mon&s;. de la Giraudais, &s;ent word, that in&s;tead of leaving France in the month of De|cember, various accidents had combined to de|tain him two months beyond that time: that
<PB N="161" REF="164">
when he had been three months at &s;ea, his rigging was &s;o greatly damaged, and his ve&s;&s;el admitted &s;o much water, that he was obliged to make the harbour of Montevideo, whence he &s;ailed for his pre&s;ent &s;tation, and had come to an anchor but a few days before Mon&s;. Bougainville's arrival.</P>
<P>The Etoile had at this time &s;alt provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to &s;upply both the ve&s;&s;els for almo&s;t a year and a half; but as her &s;tock of bread and legumes was in&s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of more than &s;even weeks, Mon&s;. Bougainville re|&s;olved on &s;ailing to Rio de la Plata, to take in a &s;tock of tho&s;e articles, as neither flour, wheat, nor bi&s;cuit could be purcha&s;ed at Rio Janeiro.</P>
<P>On the 22d of June 1767, Mon&s;. Bougain|ville and his officers paid a vi&s;it to the Viceroy of the Bra&s;ils, which was returned three days afterwards on board the Boudeu&s;e; when the Viceroy gave permi&s;&s;ion for the purcha&s;e of a &s;loop, which our adventurers imagined might be very &s;erviceable during the long voyage they propo&s;ed to make. The Chaplain of the Etoile having been murdered, &s;ome days before the arrival of the Boudeu&s;e, under the windows of the Viceroy's palace, that gentleman pro|mi&s;ed that he would endeavour to find out, and &s;everely puni&s;h, the perpetrators of the horrid deed; but Mon&s;. Bougainville complains much of his remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in the execution of this nece&s;|&s;ary piece of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="165">The Viceroy, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, continued to behave with politene&s;s to the French officers, for &s;everal days after this vi&s;it; and acquainted them, that he propo&s;ed to honour them with an elegant collation in bowers of orange-trees and ja&s;mine, on the banks of the river; and he actually gave orders, that a box at the opera &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned for their recep|tion.

<P>We cannot avoid making a remark on the il|liberal and ungentleman-like manner in which Mon&s;ieur Bougainville recites this part of his narrative; for it would be in a high degree ri|diculous to &s;uppo&s;e that the Prie&s;t, becau&s;e he had the misfortune to be crooked, &s;hould be, by that circum&s;tance, the le&s;s qualified to conduct a band; nor can we &s;ee, if the works repre&s;ented were, as our author calls them, <HI>di|vine,</HI> the great impropriety of their being under the direction of a Prie&s;t, nor of that Prie&s;t's being dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of his order. The French are ambitious of being accounted the be&s;t bred people in the world; they claim a kind of exclu&s;ive right to politene&s;s; but they are only the &s;mugglers and monopolizers of that commodity, to the injury of the fair
<PB N="163" REF="166">
traders, the Engli&s;h, the Scots, the Hibernians, who&s;e open &s;incerity, and manly freedom of behaviour, gives the lie to the French a&s;&s;ump|tion of a &s;uperior gentility. It is evident, from many in&s;tances in Mon&s;. Bougainville's voyage, that a Frenchman can, when he plea&s;es, be guilty of a &s;avage illiberality of conduct, that would di&s;grace the untutored boor of the wilds of Siberia, or the &s;till more uncultivated &s;avage of the uncivilized parts of America.</P>
<P>At this time there lay in the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, a French &s;hip, called the Morning Star, and a Spani&s;h man of war, named the Di|ligent; and, while the Viceroy behaved with all imaginable politene&s;s to the Frenchman, he had artfully protracted the &s;tay of the Spaniard no le&s;s than eight months, during all which time her Commander had not been able to pro|cure the articles nece&s;&s;ary for the repair of his ve&s;&s;el, and without which &s;he could not proceed on her voyage. In this dilemma, Don Fran|ce&s;co de Medina, Captain of the Diligent, ap|plied to Mon&s;. Bougainville, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his carpenters and caulkers, who were im|mediately &s;ent, both from the Boudeu&s;e and the Etoile.</P>
<P>The complai&s;ance with which the Viceroy treated the gentlemen on board the French ve&s;&s;els, &s;urpri&s;ed the Spaniards, who told them, that they mu&s;t not long expect &s;o great a &s;hare of his favour; and they had &s;oon rea&s;on to be
<PB N="164" REF="167">
convinced, that the prediction was founded in truth; for though the Viceroy had permitted Mon&s;. Bougainville to purcha&s;e a &s;loop, and he had actually agreed for one, his Excellency thought proper to forbid the delivery of it; and notwith&s;tanding they had contracted with this tyrannical Viceroy for the purcha&s;e of &s;ome timber from the royal Dock-yards, he af|terwards changed his mind, and would not let them have it. He even went &s;o far as to refu&s;e Mon&s;. Bougainville, and the gentlemen on board his &s;hips, permi&s;&s;ion to lodge in a hou&s;e near the town, while the Boudeu&s;e was repairing, notwith&s;tanding the owner of the hou&s;e had con&s;ented to accommodate the French officers.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville, piqued at the&s;e repeated in&s;tances of the Viceroy's want of good man|ners, and his total inattention to the common rights of humanity, determined to pay him a vi&s;it, to remon&s;trate with him on the glaring impropriety of his conduct: taking with him therefore two of his officers, he repaired to the hou&s;e of the Viceroy, who was agitated with the mo&s;t furious pa&s;&s;ion the moment Mon&s;. Bougainville began to &s;peak, and commanded him to leave the hou&s;e; this, however, he re|fu&s;ed to do, but kept his &s;eat for &s;ome time, even after the Viceroy had called his guards, who, with more prudence than their ma&s;ter had &s;hewn, neglected to obey his &s;ummons, and the French gentlemen left the hou&s;e, without &s;eem|ing
<PB N="165" REF="168">
to have cau&s;ed any di&s;turbance. Not long after their departure, an additional number of guards were placed round the palace, and or|ders were i&s;&s;ued, that if any Frenchman &s;hould be &s;een in the &s;treets after the &s;un was down, he &s;hould be taken into cu&s;tody. The Viceroy likewi&s;e commanded the Captain of the French &s;hip named the Morning Star, to quit his pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, and anchor his ve&s;&s;el under the fort of Villagahon, which order was complied with on the following day.</P>
<P>One of the Portugue&s;e officers was exiled, and another impri&s;oned, becau&s;e they had be|haved with civility to Mon&s;. Bougainville; and it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that &s;uch of the inhabi|tants of the place as traded with the French, would experience the con&s;equences of the Vice|roy's indignation; every preparation was there|fore made to quit a place, which the tyranny of the count de Acunha had rendered &s;o di&s;agree|able. The Captain of the Spani&s;h man of war &s;upplied Mon&s;. Bougainville with timber proper for the repair of his &s;hip, and an inha|bitant of Rio Janeiro privately &s;old him a num|ber of planks, which he was in great want of; and, indeed, the inhabitants in general behav|ed with a kindne&s;s and civility, which fully proved the &s;en&s;e they entertained of the impro|priety of the Viceroy's conduct.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to give an account of the riches of Rio Janeiro, and the
<PB N="166" REF="169">
amount of the revenues ari&s;ing to the King of Portugal, from the mines of Bra&s;il; the&s;e mines we have already given &s;ome account of in the former part of this work, but as Mon&s;. Bougainville's account is very intere&s;ting, and contains many particulars there unnoticed, we make no doubt but the reader will approve our tracing him with the pen of accuracy and fidelity.</P>
<P>The mines which lie neare&s;t to the city of Rio Janeiro are not le&s;s di&s;tant than two hun|dred and twenty miles, and are called the <HI>General mines.</HI> His mo&s;t faithful maje&s;ty, having a fifth part of the produce of the&s;e mines, &s;el|dom receives le&s;s than one hundred and twelve arobas of gold from their annual produce, and &s;ometimes con&s;iderably more.</P>
<P>There are mines at Sero-frio, Sabara, and Rio des Mortes, which are under the juri&s;diction of the managers of the general mines. Near Sero-frio is a river, the &s;tream of which being turn|ed out of its u&s;ual channel, diamonds, topazes, chry&s;olites, and other valuable &s;tones, are found among the pebbles in the bed of the river; nor are any diamonds brought from the Bra&s;ils but what are found in this particular &s;pot.</P>
<P>The &s;tones thus found are deemed the pro|perty of the owners of the mines; but the King of Portugal has appointed a &s;urveyor, to whom they mu&s;t give in an account of what diamonds are found with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. The&s;e the &s;urveyor puts into a ca&s;ket which has three
<PB N="167" REF="170">
locks, and is enclo&s;ed in iron plates; the Vice|roy keeping one of the keys, the <HI>Provador de Hazienda Reale</HI> the &s;econd, and the &s;urveyor the third. This ca&s;ket, and the keys with which it is locked, are then enclo&s;ed in a &s;econd ca&s;ket, on which the&s;e three gentlemen affix their &s;eals; and this again is placed in a third, on which the Viceroy puts his &s;eal, and thus &s;hips the trea&s;ure for Portugal, where the coffers are opened in the pre&s;ence of his mo&s;t faithful maje&s;ty, who having &s;elected &s;uch of the dia|monds as he plea&s;es, the owners of the mines are paid for them, at a rate &s;tipulated by a pre|vious agreement.</P>
<P>The number of &s;laves employed in &s;earching for diamonds is about eight hundred, and for every day's labour of each of the&s;e &s;laves the King of Portugal receives a Spani&s;h dollar from the proprietors of the mines.</P>
<P>It is extremely dangerous for any per&s;on to &s;ecrete a diamond; yet the practice is very common, as the &s;muggled goods can be &s;o ea&s;ily hidden. When a per&s;on is detected in this il|licit trade, if he is rich he is &s;entenced to de|liver up the diamonds, pay twice their value, &s;uffer one year's impri&s;onment, and then be bani&s;hed to the coa&s;t of Africa for life: but if the offender be poor, he is generally doomed to &s;uffer capitally.</P>
<P>In every di&s;trict of the Bra&s;ils where gold is found, a hou&s;e is erected, to which it mu&s;t be
<PB N="168" REF="171">
carried, and the King's &s;hare paid, the re&s;t is &s;ent to Rio Janeiro, where it is melted into wedges, and in that &s;tate returned to the owners: the&s;e wedges being numbered, and &s;tamped with the King's arms, the weight is marked on each wedge: the gold is likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ayed, and the alloy &s;tamped on it, for the greater expedition when it comes to be coined.</P>
<P>About ninety miles from Rio Janeiro is a place called <HI>Praybuna,</HI> where there is an office for the regi&s;tering the ingots which are the pro|perty of private people; and as all per&s;ons coming from the mines mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s this place, two military officers are &s;tationed here, who have fifty men under their command, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is &s;trictly to examine, that no illicit trade is carried on; &s;o that every one who pa&s;&s;es is obliged to &s;ubmit to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch. At this place, exclu&s;ive of the tax to the King, men and bea&s;ts of burden are taxed with a far|ther toll of a real and a half each, the half of which becomes the property of the officers and &s;oldiers, and the other half goes to his Portu|gue&s;e Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The ingots of gold which belong to private people having been regi&s;tered at Praybuna, are then carried to Rio Janeiro, where the pro|prietors are paid their value in demi-doubloons&punc; which are worth about thirty &s;hillings each o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Engli&s;h money; but there is a profit to the King for alloy, and for coining the&s;e demi-dou+bloons,
<PB N="169" REF="172">
of about four &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence on each. The mint at Rio Janeiro is a mo&s;t noble building, admirably adapted for the purpo&s;e of coining money, which is performed with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing expedition; and this, indeed, is rendered nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e two Portugue&s;e fleets u&s;ually arrive nearly at the &s;ame time that the gold is brought from the mines.</P>
<P>The fleet which arrives from Porto brings coar&s;e cloth, &s;everal articles of food, with bran|dy, wines, and vinegar; and this, with the fleet which comes from Li&s;bon, occa&s;ions Rio Janeiro to be a place of very con&s;iderable trade; the effects on being landed, are charged with a duty of ten per cent. to his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Soon after the earthquake at Li&s;bon, in the year 1755, an impo&s;t of two and a half per cent. under the denomination of a free gift to the King, was laid on all goods landed at Rio Janeiro, &s;o that the whole duty paid is no le&s;s than twelve and a half per cent. The latter duty is in&s;tantly paid on the goods being brought on &s;hore, but the officers of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e will take &s;ecurity for the payment of the for|mer at the expiration of half a year.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tricts, named Pratacon and Quiaba, the mines of which produce diamonds; but no per&s;on is permitted to &s;eek for them, that the market may not be over&s;tocked; for it
<PB N="170" REF="173">
is evident that, to make diamonds plentiful, would be to render them of little value.</P>
<P>His Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty is at an expence of about one hundred and forty-five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, annually, for repairing of the &s;hips and public buildings, working the mines, and paying all his &s;ervants, civil and military.</P>
<P>The following account will &s;hew what value, in &s;terling money, ari&s;es annually to his mo&s;t faithful Maje&s;ty, from the royal revenues of Rio de Janeiro.</P>

<P>Hence it will appear, that the revenues ari&s;|ing to the King of Portugal from Rio Janeiro are &s;omething more, annually, than four hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, reck|oning the dollars at four &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence each.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his leaving Rio Janeiro, and his &s;e|cond voyage to Montevideo; of which we &s;hall carefully &s;elect as many particulars as may af|ford either in&s;truction or entertainment to the reader.</P>
<P>On the 14th of July 1767, the anchors of the Boudeu&s;e and Etoile were weighed; but as the wind abated &s;oon afterwards, they were obliged again to bring to, before they could get out of the harbour. They &s;ailed, however, on the following day; and in the night of the 19th, the main-top-&s;ail of the Boudeu&s;e was carried away by the violence of the wind.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="175">On board of Mon&s;. Bougainville's &s;hip was a profe&s;&s;or of a&s;tronomy, who had made the ex|pedition with a view of di&s;covering the longi|tude at &s;ea; and as an eclip&s;e of the &s;un was to happen on the 25th of the month, great hopes were formed, that an opportunity would thereby be obtained of making the wi&s;hed-for di&s;covery: but it happened, that the&s;e &s;anguine hopes were all fru&s;trated, by the intervention of clouds, which ob&s;cured the face of the &s;un almo&s;t during the whole time of the eclip&s;e.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 28th our adventurers had &s;ight of the Ca&s;tilles, at the di&s;tance of &s;omething more than thirty miles. They &s;aw the entrance of a bay, which Mon&s;. Bougain|ville conjectures to be the &s;ame on the banks of which the Spaniards have erected a fort. The ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed into the Rio de la Plata, and were within fight of the Maldonados on the 29th; early in the morning of the 31&s;t, they had a view of the I&s;le of Lobos, and before night came to an anchor in the Bay of Montevideo.</P>
<P>The &s;hips were no &s;ooner anchored, than the Governor &s;ent a gentleman on board Mon&s;. Bougainville's ve&s;&s;el, who acquainted him, that mo&s;t of the Je&s;uits in tho&s;e parts had been late|ly &s;eized, and their e&s;tates confi&s;cated, in con|&s;equence of an order received from the Court of Spain: that the&s;e devoted victims of &s;upe|rior power had &s;carcely made the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance; that they bore their misfortunes with a
<PB N="173" REF="176">
degree of patience and calm &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that did them honour; and that no le&s;s than forty of them had been taken away in the ve&s;&s;el which brought the orders for their di&s;grace.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary that Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;hould remain in his pre&s;ent &s;tation till the equi|nox was pa&s;&s;ed, his fir&s;t care was to build an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick, and to take lodgings at Montevideo. This being done, he repaired to Buenos Ayres, in order to ha&s;ten the provi&s;ion of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as he wanted, for which he was to pay the &s;ame price as the King of Spain u&s;ually gave for the &s;ame commodities.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville was al&s;o de&s;irous of con|ver&s;ing with the Governor-general Don Franci&s;co Buccarelli, on the behaviour of the Governor of Rio Janeiro; and he &s;oon learnt, that Don Buc|carelli, in&s;tead of making repri&s;als on the Viceroy of the Bra&s;ils, which he could have done, very much to the prejudice of Portugal, had, more prudently, only &s;ent a narrative of his pro|ceedings to the Court of Spain.</P>
<P>Don Buccarelli was &s;o obligingly ready to &s;upply Mon&s;. Bougainville with &s;uch articles as he &s;tood in need of, that in le&s;s than three weeks two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed for Montevideo, with ladings of flour and bi&s;cuit for the u&s;e of the French &s;hips. Mon&s;. Bougainville al&s;o &s;ail|ed to Montevideo, leaving an inferior officer at Buenos Ayres, to &s;ee the remainder of their provi&s;ions &s;hipped.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="177">They now expected to &s;ail in a &s;hort time, when an accident happened that detained them &s;ome weeks beyond the intended period. A Spani&s;h regi&s;ter-&s;hip being at anchor, a violent hurricane aro&s;e in the night, and driving her again&s;t the Etoile, carried away part of the head of that ve&s;&s;el, and broke her bow&s;prit on a level with the deck.</P>
<P>The leaks of the Etoile being encrea&s;ed by this accident, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould undergo a thorough repair; but as there was not timber enough at Montevideo for this purpo&s;e, Mon&s;. Bougainville obtained Don Buccarelli's permi&s;&s;ion, that &s;he might &s;ail up the river, to the Encenada de Baragan, which is a little bay formed by its mouth; and in this bay, by the 21&s;t of October, &s;he was put in a condition proper for &s;ailing, and be|gan to take in the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the road of Encenada Mon&s;. Bougainville found a frigate and &s;everal merchant-&s;hips which were bound for Europe, and two Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which having taken in a &s;tore of ammu|nition and provi&s;ions, were bound to Falkland's i&s;lands; and from thence to the South Seas, to take on board the Je&s;uits of Peru and Chili. Two Xebecks likewi&s;e lay here, one of which was loaded with pre&s;ents from his mo&s;t Catholic Maje&s;ty, to the inhabitants of Terra del Fue|go, in grateful te&s;timony of his &s;en&s;e of their generous conduct towards the crew of the &s;hip
<PB N="175" REF="178">
Conception, which was wrecked on their coa&s;ts about two years before.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the country on the banks of the Encenada de Baragan live in poor mean huts, which are con&s;tructed with ru&s;hes, having a covering of leather. The&s;e are built in a very irregular manner, on a mi&s;erably barren &s;oil, and the country around them is &s;o poor, that the people find it very difficult to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>From the road of Encenada de Baragan five &s;hips &s;ailed for Spain, having on board mo&s;t of the French families which had quitted Falkland's i&s;lands, and two hundred and fifty Je&s;uits. About this time two Spani&s;h regi&s;ter &s;hips ar|rived, one of them had been no le&s;s than &s;even months in her pa&s;&s;age from Europe, above &s;ix weeks of which were expended in the doubling of Cape Horn, where the fury of the winds was &s;uch as to carry away her rudder, and lay her under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking &s;helter in this port. When &s;he arrived &s;he had buried no le&s;s than thirty-nine of her men, and almo&s;t all the re&s;t were &s;o enfeebled by the &s;curvy, that only a few of the officers, and three of the fore ma&s;t-men were able to do their duty towards navi|gating the ve&s;&s;el. Mon&s;. Bougainville, with the greate&s;t humanity, &s;ent a number of his crew on board her, by which &s;he was enabled to reach the harbour of Montevideo.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="179">Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his &s;ailing from Montevideo to the i&s;land of St. Elizabeth, which includes a narra|tive of what pa&s;&s;ed on his interview with the Patagonians, and &s;everal other intere&s;ting par|ticulars till he reached the i&s;le of St. Elizabeth.</P>
<P>The Etoile &s;ailed from the Encenada on the 30th of October, and the Boudeu&s;e on the day following, having on board provi&s;ions for ten months, and &s;oon reached Montevideo, having lo&s;t three men in that &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, by a boat, in which they were &s;itting running fowl under the &s;hip at a time when &s;he was wearing; two other men who were in the boat were with much dif|ficulty &s;aved, and the boat was recovered.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 14th of Novem|ber, 1767, they &s;ailed from Montevideo, with a fine gale of wind at north, being in &s;ight of land till the evening. On the 16th and the five following days, the &s;ea ran high, and the wind was contrary, &s;o that they were obliged to reef their top-&s;ails. On the 22d the wind blew a perfect &s;torm, which continued all the &s;ucceed|ing night in &s;qualls, attended with rain; the Etoile made a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, but the violence of the gale would not admit of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance being given them. As the waves became le&s;s mountainous, by the abating of the wind in the morning, Mon&s;. Bougainville hailed the Etoile, to make enquiry into what damage &s;he had &s;u&s;|tained in the late violent &s;torm; when he learnt
<PB N="177" REF="180">
that &s;everal of her chain plates, and her fore-top-&s;ail-yard had been carried away, and that &s;he had lo&s;t almo&s;t all the cattle which had been purcha&s;ed at Montevideo: the Boudeu&s;e had likewi&s;e lo&s;t mo&s;t of her cattle, but had &s;u&s;|tained no other damage.</P>
<P>The winds were at this time very uncertain, frequently changing during the remainder of the month, and the currents were &s;o violent, as to drive the ve&s;&s;els as far as the forty-fifth degree of &s;outh latitude. They now concluded, that they were between thirty and forty degrees from the coa&s;t of Patagonia; and, at length, when they had &s;oundings with a line of forty fathom, they had &s;ight of Cape Virgins; the &s;ame land which Sir John Narborough and Com|modore An&s;on have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Cape Virgin Mary.</P>
<P>As Mon&s;. Bougainville had, during a former voyage, di&s;covered a &s;unken rock in forty-eight degrees and a half of &s;outh latitude, he avoided coming too near the &s;hore till he was in forty-nine degrees; the per&s;on who had for|merly fir&s;t &s;een this rock, imagined it had been a grampus, and the &s;hip had &s;ailed within con|&s;iderably le&s;s than a mile of it.</P>
<P>It was on the 2d of December that they had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ht of Cape Virgins, about which time they made all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible, as the wind was in their favour.

<P>On the 4th of December the fore-&s;ail of the Boudeu&s;e was &s;plit by the fury of the winds, and as at this time they were in no deeper water than twenty fathom, they determined to &s;cud under their bare poles, le&s;t they &s;hould run fowl of &s;ome breakers which lie off Cape Vir|gins, to the &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>They now made other fruitle&s;s attempts to enter the &s;treight, &s;ometimes being within &s;ight of the Cape, and at other times at a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance from it. Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays that the view of this Cape, as given in An&s;on's voyage, is exact in every re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The night of the 5th was &s;pent in &s;tanding off and on; and early in the morning of the &s;ixth they were in &s;ight of Cape Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and likewi&s;e of Terra del Fuego. They now took the advantage of a we&s;terly tide, and tried to get clo&s;e to the coa&s;t of Patagonia. They kept &s;ounding all the night between the &s;ixth and &s;eventh, not &s;ailing to a greater di&s;tance from the coa&s;t than three leagues. What they had gained by plying to the windward, they lo&s;t by the oppo&s;ition of the currents, and about noon on the 7th were back in their former &s;tation.&mdash;What man in his &s;en&s;es, who reads accounts like the&s;e, would hazard the imminent dangers of &s;uch &s;eas, for the honour of having made a

new di&s;covery, or the pride of &s;aying, that he had circumnavigated the globe!</P>
<P>This day they had &s;ight of Cape Orange, which forms the fir&s;t narrow pa&s;s in the &s;treights. This narrow pa&s;s Mon&s;. Bougainville called <HI>goulet,</HI> which is not improperly tran&s;lated <HI>gut.</HI> It is rather more than forty miles from Cape Virgins to this fir&s;t gut, and the &s;treights, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s di&s;tance, are of different breadths, of &s;el|dom le&s;s than five, or more than &s;even leagues. On the north coa&s;t the land is high and heal|thy, and has a regular appearance, as far as Cape Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the bays of which there are &s;everal dangerous rocks, oppo&s;ite to the two hillocks, to which Sir John Narborough gave the name of the A&s;&s;es Ears.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, when they had reached the entrance of the gut, though the wind blew fre&s;h, and all their &s;ails were &s;et, the tide ran with &s;o great force, that they were driven back|wards, in&s;tead of advancing in their voyage.</P>
<P>In the evening the &s;hips were anchored in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Bay, and on the eighth, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a &s;trong breeze, they &s;temmed the tide; and afterwards, by making different tacks, they got through the fir&s;t narrow entrance of the gut, with the wind right again&s;t them.</P>
<P>During the preceding night they had ob|&s;erved fires on the &s;hore, and this morning they di&s;covered a white flag, which the Patagonians had erected on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ing ground; on which a
<PB N="181" REF="184">
white flag was likewi&s;e hoi&s;ted at the ma&s;t-head of each ve&s;&s;el. The flag which the&s;e Patago|nians had put up, was one given to them by the Commander of the Etoile, when that &s;hip lay in Boucault's Bay, in the month of June 1766, &s;o that it is pretty evident, that the people were the &s;ame. Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;peaks in very grateful terms of the care the&s;e Indians had taken to pre&s;erve the flag.</P>
<P>While the &s;hips were pa&s;&s;ing the above|mentioned gut, a number of men, clothed in the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, were ob&s;erved on Terra del Fuego, who ran along the &s;hore with their ut|mo&s;t expedition, in order to keep pace with the ve&s;&s;els: they likewi&s;e frequently beckoned with their hands, as if they wi&s;hed our voyagers to land. The Spaniards &s;ay, that the inha|bitants of that part of Terra del Fuego, are le&s;s &s;avage in their manners than mo&s;t other native Indians. When Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ailed from Rio de la Plata, a Spani&s;h &s;hip was on the point of &s;ailing thence, to convey &s;ome Prie&s;ts, to in&s;truct the&s;e people in the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The &s;hips having come to an anchor in the afternoon, in Boucault's Bay, &s;everal officers from each ve&s;&s;el, having fire arms with them, embarked in boats, and went a&s;hore at the bot|tom of the bay. The common &s;ailors were or|dered to remain in the boats, and to keep them afloat: the gentlemen were no &s;ooner landed,
<PB N="182" REF="185">
than half a dozen of the natives came riding up to them, on the full &s;peed. When they were advanced within fifty yards of the French, they di&s;mounted, and came forward, pronounc|ing the word <HI>Shawa.</HI> Having come up quite clo&s;e, they held out their arms, and laid them on tho&s;e of the officers, whom they &s;hook hands with, and embraced, repeatedly &s;aying <HI>Shawa,</HI> which word was repeated by Mon&s;. Bougainville and his officers.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;hman, on reading the above pa&s;|&s;age, may be allowed to make a remark on the &s;ingular politene&s;s of the&s;e &s;avages, manife&s;ted by the circum&s;tance of <HI>embracing</HI>; but he will not pay &s;o vile a compliment to the delicacy of the unin&s;tructed Patagonian, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that he made the fir&s;t advance towards a &s;alute: on the contrary, it is but a piece of ju&s;tice due to the &s;uperior good-breeding of the French, to conclude, that they taught the &s;avages that wor&s;t rudiment of all politene&s;s, that mo&s;t fil|thy deviation from all decent and manly behavi|our, the &s;hocking cu&s;tom of men ki&s;&s;ing each other! An Engli&s;hman of virtuous principles and refined ideas, would &s;corn to ki&s;s his own &s;on, whom he had not &s;een for a twelvemonth, if the boy but approached to his teens: no! let the manly &s;hake of the hand, and the gene|rous effu&s;ion of the heart from the lips, be the only expre&s;&s;ions of affection, duty or polite|ne&s;s, between man and man.

be re&s;erved for tho&s;e amiable creatures, to whom God and Nature have taught us they are due.</P>
<P>The Patagonians appeared to be much plea&s;|ed with the company of their new friends; but it was ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of them had a mix|ture of fear imprinted on their countenances: this, however, was &s;oon removed by the ho&s;pi|tality of the officers, who &s;ent to the boats for bread and cakes, which were as readily devour|ed as they were chearfully given. More of the Indians &s;oon approached, among whom were &s;ome children. They expre&s;&s;ed no kind of &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ight of their vi&s;itants, and &s;eem|ed not to be unacquainted with the u&s;e of fire|arms, as appeared by their making a noi&s;e which re&s;embled the report of a gun. The good nature of the&s;e people was expre&s;&s;ed in all their actions: &s;ome of the French gentlemen being engaged in collecting plants, the Patago|nians no &s;ooner &s;aw what kinds they collected, than they immediately began to pull up and bring the &s;ame &s;orts. One of them &s;eeing an officer engaged in this employment, went to him, and pointing to his eye, which had re|ceived an injury, intimated his wi&s;h, that &s;ome herb might be &s;hewn him, the virtues of which would cure the di&s;order: and this was deemed to be a conclu&s;ive proof, that they had an idea of the medicinal virtues of herbs.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">Mon&s;. Bougainville received from the&s;e Pa|tagonians a number of &s;kins of the guanacoe and other bea&s;ts, in exchange for a few trinkets, on which they &s;eemed to &s;et a great value. Some of the gentlemen having red cloaths on, the natives advanced, and &s;troked them with their hands, &s;eeming highly delighted with every thing of that colour; they al&s;o made &s;igns for &s;ome tobacco, and as often as any thing was given them, they cried out <HI>&s;hawa,</HI> in a very loud and di&s;agreeable tone.</P>
<P>A &s;mall quantity of brandy being given to each of the Patagonians, they had no &s;ooner drank it, than they &s;truck their hands repeat|edly again&s;t their throats, and blew with their mouths, &s;o as to produce a kind of trembling &s;ound, at the conclu&s;ion of which they had a &s;ingular quivering of the lips.</P>
<P>The evening now advanced, and the gentle|men prepared to return to their &s;hips, which was no &s;ooner ob&s;erved by the Indians, than their unea&s;ine&s;s was expre&s;&s;ed in their counte|nances, and they intimated, by &s;igns, that they wi&s;hed them to remain longer, as they expected more of their brethren. The French, on the contrary, made &s;igns that they would come again the next day, and bring &s;uch articles as the natives had reque&s;ted of them.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville and his party now walked towards their boats, accompanied by the In|dians, one of whom &s;ung &s;ongs till they reach|ed
<PB N="185" REF="188">
the coa&s;t, and &s;everal of them went into the water as far as where the boats lay, where they &s;eized on all the articles they could put their hands on; but when they &s;aw they were ob&s;erv|ed, they made no &s;cruple to return them.</P>
<P>As the boats were rowing off, many more Patagonians were ob&s;erved galloping down to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> countrymen; and the crews of the boats now cried out <HI>Shawa,</HI> &s;o loud that the people on &s;hore could not fail to hear them.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that the&s;e Indians were the &s;ame which were &s;een by the crew of the Etoile, in the year 1765, for one of the &s;eamen recollected a per&s;on among them whom he had before &s;een. The&s;e people are well trade, and appear to be about the height de&s;|cribed by other voyagers. Our author &s;ays, that it is the thickne&s;s of their limbs, the largene&s;s of their heads, and the extraordinary breadth of their &s;houlders, that make them appear to be of a gigantic race.</P>
<P>The colour of the Patagonians is brown, as is that of all the native Americans, in whatever climate they are born. Their mu&s;cles are &s;trong, and their nerves well braced; and as their food abounds in juices proper for the nouri&s;hment of the human frame, it is no won|der that they arrive at their full growth. Their eyes are &s;parkling, their teeth extremely white, and their faces round, but rather flat; and many of them are very comely men. Some of them
<PB N="186" REF="189">
have whi&s;kers, which grow long, but are very thin; and they all tie their hair, which is long and black, on the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">p of the head; the cheeks of &s;ome of them are painted red. Their lan|guage has an agreeable and melodious &s;ound. Our voyagers did not &s;ee any of the Patago|nian w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">men; though it was conjectured, that the men intended to have brought them from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> camp, which appeared to be about three miles di&s;tant.</P>

<P>It was in the &s;ummer when Mon&s;.

<P>The re&s;t of the dre&s;s of the Patagonians con|&s;i&s;ted of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of half boots, made of the &s;kin of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and left open at the back part of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">g. A few of them wore on the thigh a ring made of copper, two inches in breadth;
<PB N="187" REF="190">
and the necks of two very young men were adorned with beads.</P>
<P>Some &s;mall knives, of the manufacture of England, were &s;een in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which our author very properly concludes were the gift of Commodore Byron; and their only arms con&s;i&s;ted of a twi&s;ted gut, in the two ends of which were enclo&s;ed a round p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">bble; and weapons of that kind, he &s;ays, are u&s;ed in all that part of the American continent.</P>
<P>Their hor&s;es are very poor, and of a &s;mall &s;ize; and the &s;addles and bridles were &s;uch as are u&s;ed by the natives of Rio de la Plata. One of the&s;e people was ob&s;erved to have gilt nails on his &s;addle, &s;tirrups made of wood, enclo&s;ed with copper, a bridle made of leather, twi&s;ted, and a compleat Spani&s;h harne&s;s.</P>
<P>Their food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of guanacoes and vicunnas, and they eat both the fle&s;h and mar|row of tho&s;e animals. They devour this meat raw, with great avidity, and carry it with them on their hor&s;es. Fre&s;h water being very &s;carce in this country, the hor&s;es drink the &s;ea water, as do likewi&s;e their dogs, which are both &s;mall and ugly.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of them pro|nounced <HI>capitan, chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, bueno,</HI> and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">pa|ni&s;h words. Mon&s;. Bougainville concludes, that the Patagonians lead the &s;ame kind of life as the Tartars, as they are always on hor&s;eback, traver&s;ing immen&s;e plains, in pur&s;uit of wild
<PB N="188" REF="191">
bea&s;ts and game; and he imagines that they al&s;o, like the Tartars, plunder the caravans of travellers; but this remark &s;eems equally cruel and unju&s;t, from his own account of the &s;in|gular friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s with which they treated him&s;elf and his fellow-voyagers. Our author concludes this part of his narrative by &s;aying, that he has <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince found a nation in the &s;outh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">acific ocean, which is taller than the Patagonians."</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s; Bougainville tells us, that the &s;oil of this country is extremely dry, and very much like that of Falkland's i&s;lands: the coa&s;t, like|wi&s;e, exhibits the &s;ame kind of &s;ea-weeds, and &s;hells of &s;imilar &s;orts are &s;trewed upon the beach. The country produces &s;hrubs, but af|fords no woods for &s;helter.</P>
<P>On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th of December, 1767, all the &s;ails of the ve&s;&s;els were &s;et, to make head again&s;t the fury of the tide; but they were obliged again to come to an anchor, after &s;ailing only three miles. During two whole days the wea|ther was &s;o tempe&s;tuous, that not a boat could put off from the &s;hips, which was a mortifying circum&s;tance, as great num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rs of the Pata|gonians were by this time got t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ther, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ot where they had conver&s;ed with the officers, who were concerned that they were not able to keep t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">r promi&s;e with the&s;e friendly people, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e little wants might have been ea&s;ily &s;up|pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, by the help of gla&s;&s;es, that

they had built &s;everal huts on the &s;hore, and it was ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of them were con&s;tantly galloping backwards and forwards from this place to a &s;pot, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed the main body of them lay.</P>
<P>Early on the morning of the 12th the Bou|deu&s;e lo&s;t an anchor, by the parting of the cable; &s;oon after which they &s;et all their &s;ails, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ebb-tide, and a fa|vourable wind, they got through the &s;econd gut in the afternoon, and anchored on the north-&s;ide of the i&s;le of Elizabeth.</P>
<P>As they were detained here two days, by tempe&s;tuous weather, and contrary winds, Mon&s;. Bougainville re&s;olved to land on the i&s;le of Elizabeth, where he met with a few bu&s;tards, that were at this time hatching their eggs, but the&s;e birds were &s;o intimidated at the &s;ight of our adventurers, that they could not approach near enough to have even a &s;ingle &s;hot at them. The i&s;land produces no wood, but only a kind of heath, which might &s;upply its place as fuel f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r the fire. The water of this place is brack|i&s;h, and the &s;oil extremely dry. Several places were likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, which had been mar&s;hes, but had become dry, and the ground on &s;ome parts of them were covered with a thin cru&s;t of &s;alt. It was evident that this i&s;land was occa|&s;ionally vi&s;ited by the Indians, as the &s;hells of &s;ome fi&s;h they had eaten were found, near
<PB N="190" REF="193">
where a dead dog was lying, and where it was plain that fires had been made.</P>
<P>Our adventurers were now on the point of entering that part of the &s;treights of Magellan which abounds in woods, and the principal dif|ficulties were already overcome.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of the 30th the anchors were weighed, and they &s;ailed, with a violent wind, in a channel between the i&s;lands of St. Barthelemi and Lions, and that of Elizabeth. They were now obliged to coa&s;t the la&s;t named i&s;land, to &s;teer clear of a number of breakers, with which the other i&s;lands are encompa&s;&s;ed. Having &s;ailed beyond Cape Noir, they ob&s;erv|ed that the country had a plea&s;ant appearance, being almo&s;t every where covered with woods, which afforded a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect to the eye.</P>
<P>In the evening the weather became &s;uddenly calm and plea&s;ant, &s;o that Mon&s;. Bougainville plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the hope of being able to double Cape Round before the morning; but in this climate the mo&s;t flattering appearances are by no means to be relied on; a truth that was fully evinced in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance: for &s;oon after twelve at night the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifted, and blew mo&s;t violently, bringing with it &s;torms of hail, and deluges of rain, while a fog, apparently impenetrable, covered the whole coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="194">The main-&s;ail of the Boudeu&s;e being &s;plit by this &s;torm, they endeavoured to make Port Famine, where they hoped to be &s;heltered from the tempe&s;t; but this attempt was fruitle&s;s; for the violence of the current was &s;uch, that they lo&s;t nine miles in as many hours, and were hurried with amazing rapidity into a large bay, formed by part of the coa&s;t of Terra del Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">go, which Mon&s;. Bougainville called Bay Duclos, from the name of the officer who was next in command under the Commodore of the expedition, and who&s;e knowledge and expe|ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nce are mentioned as circum&s;tances highly advantageous to the enterprize.</P>
<P>This Bay is de&s;cribed as being very conve|nient for &s;hips to anchor in, on account of the we&s;terly winds blowing over the coa&s;t. Two &s;mall rivers di&s;charge their &s;treams into the bay, the water of which is excellent at about a quarter of a mile from the &s;ea coa&s;t, though nearer than that di&s;tance it is impregnated with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> particles. The landing-place is a &s;andy beach, above which a plea&s;ant meadow &s;tretches it&s;elf to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Behind this meadow the woods rai&s;e their lofty heads, and form a kind of amphitheatre. Our adventurers traver&s;ed a con&s;iderable tract of the country, without meeting with any living animal, except a very few parroquets, bu&s;tards, ducks, teals, and two or three &s;nipes.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="195">Several huts were &s;een at the mouth of a river, which had been con&s;tructed by twi&s;ting branches or trees into the form of an oven. In the&s;e huts were found large numbers of lim|pets, mu&s;cles, and calcined &s;hells; and the huts them&s;elves appeared to have been recently made. Our adventurers going &s;ome miles up the river, ob&s;erved the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ck of human crea|tures, and remarked, that the flood came from the ea&s;t at the ri&s;ing of the tide, which they had not before ob&s;erved in any other part of the &s;treights.</P>
<P>The &s;eamen were now engaged in cutting wood till the 16th, when the ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed with a favourable wind, and pa&s;&s;ed Point St. Anne, which covers Port Famine, a bay &s;o called, on account of the di&s;a&s;trous fate of the colony formerly e&s;tabli&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d on its borders by the too adventrous Spaniards.</P>
<P>Mon&s;.

<P>There are four bays proper for the anchoring of ve&s;&s;els, between Cape Forward and Cape Round; and two of the&s;e bays are &s;eparated by a Cape of a mo&s;t &s;ingular kind, which con|&s;i&s;ts of petrified &s;hells, laying horizontally, and ri&s;ing more than fifty yards above the level of the &s;ea.

<P>As the &s;hips were now becalmed for two hours, our Commodore took this opportunity of taking the &s;oundings near, and the bearings of Cape Forward, which he mentions as the mo&s;t &s;outherly point of land, on the continent, in the known world, and he fixes its latitude at fifty-four degrees, five minutes, and forty-five &s;econds, &s;outh. Its &s;urface con&s;i&s;ts of two hills, &s;omething more than two miles in ex|tent, one of which is con&s;iderably higher than the other. The tops of the&s;e hills are covered with &s;now, which gradually melting by the warmth of the &s;un, &s;upply with perpetual moi&s;ture the roots of trees which are fixed in the crevices of the rock.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">Mon&s;.

<P>Having returned to the &s;hip, and the wind coming about favourable, Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ailed in &s;earch of a harbour, which received the name of <HI>French Bay,</HI> where he re&s;olved to take in a quantity of wood and water, as a &s;up|ply during their voyage acro&s;s the great South-Sea. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution all the boats were in&s;tantly hoi&s;ted out, with a view to begin this nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s the next morning.</P>

As it was low water when the boat reached the &s;hore, her crew could not land without running her a-ground on a &s;and; and it was evident, that the larger boats could only make the &s;hore

at high water, &s;o that their wood and water could be brought on board only once a day. For the&s;e rea&s;ons Mon&s;. Bougainville determined to anchor in a &s;mall bay about three miles di&s;|tant, called after his own name, where he had, in the year 1765, taken in a loading of wood for Falkland's i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Bougainville bay, to which they now &s;ailed, is &s;urrounded by high mountains, which &s;ecure it from the winds blowing from every point of the compa&s;s, &s;o that the &s;urface of the water is unruffled even by a &s;ingle breeze.</P>
<P>Having ca&s;t their anchors in this bay, and made fa&s;t the ve&s;&s;els by means of haw&s;ers tied to &s;ome trees on the coa&s;t, they landed, and found two Indian huts, con&s;tructed of the bran|ches of trees, but they did not appear to have been lately inhabited. In the year 1765 Mon&s;. Bougainville had cau&s;ed a hut of bark to be erected on this &s;pot, in which he left &s;ome trifles, by way of pre&s;ent to &s;uch of the natives as might happen to wander that way; on this hut he had put up a white flag; but both the pre|&s;ents and the flag had been taken away, and the hut levelled with the ground.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 18th of December a kind of camp was formed on &s;hore, by way of guarding the effects which were landed, and protecting the men who were to be employed in taking in wood and water. Small ponds were now dug, for the accommodation of tho&s;e
<PB N="196" REF="200">
de&s;tined to wa&s;h the linen, and the water ca&s;ks were &s;ent on &s;hore to be repaired. The crew of the Eagle having, in 1765, cut down many more trees than were wanted for that ve&s;&s;el, the labour of this ta&s;k was &s;aved to our pre&s;ent adventurers, who were likewi&s;e happy in finding roads ready made through the woods, for the convenience of bringing down the timber to the &s;ea-&s;hore. At this place the remainder of the month was &s;pent in the nece&s;&s;ary employment above-mentioned, and in repairing the &s;hips, particularly the Etoile, which had &s;o large a leak in her &s;tem, that mo&s;t of the hands on board her were fatigued beyond expre&s;&s;ion, by &s;tanding at the pumps, alternately, night and day.</P>
<P>The a&s;tronomer, Mon&s;. Verron, now landed on a little i&s;land, which was denominated the <HI>I&s;le of Ob&s;ervatory,</HI> from its being a place ad|mirably calculated for the making a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations; but his labours were fruitle&s;s, owing to the cloudine&s;s of the weather, which is almo&s;t perpetual in this country. At &s;ome periods, however, the &s;un appeared free from clouds, and melted a part of the &s;now which had lodged on the mountains of the main land. Whenever this fine weather happened, the prince of Na&s;&s;au, attended by Mon&s;. de Com|mer&ccedil;on, a celebrated botani&s;t, went in &s;earch of plants and herbs, and they were very &s;ucce&s;sful in their re&s;earches: but the gentlemen who en|deavoured
<PB N="197" REF="201">
to fi&s;h, or to hunt for animals, met with no &s;uch good fortune, for they never catch|ed even a &s;ingle fi&s;h, nor ever &s;aw any quadru|ped but one fox, which was killed by the party employed in collecting the &s;tores.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville having formed a re&s;olu|tion of taking a &s;urvey of the coa&s;ts of the main land, and likewi&s;e of tho&s;e of Terra del Fuego, he embarked in his boat, early in the morning of the 22d, accompanied by two gen|tlemen, who propo&s;ed to &s;ail with him as far as Cape Holland. The weather was calm and &s;erene at their fir&s;t &s;etting out; but the wind &s;oon varied to different points of the compa&s;s, and blew a hurricane, which obliged our ad|venturers to take &s;helter in the mouth of a &s;mall river. Having gained the de&s;ired port, they waited in the hope that the &s;torm would abate, till they were almo&s;t benumbed with the cold, and wet to the &s;kin with the rain; they therefore landed, and cutting down &s;ome branches of trees, erected a kind of hut, in order to &s;helter them during the night. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e huts (&s;ays Mon&s;. Bougainville) &s;erve as palaces to the natives of the&s;e climates; but we had not yet learnt their cu&s;tom of living in them."</Q></P>
<P>It continued to rain ince&s;&s;antly, and was at the &s;ame time &s;o cold, that the gentlemen found their pre&s;ent &s;ituation untenable; they therefore &s;heltered them&s;elves as well as they could under the &s;ail of the boat, and kept up a large fire all
<PB N="198" REF="202">
night, which was tempe&s;tuous in a very high degree. In the morning they ha&s;tened to their boat, and returned to the &s;hip, happy, by that means, to avoid the effects of the growing tem|pe&s;t, which &s;oon became &s;o violent, that it would have prevented their returning at all. For two days after this it &s;nowed continually, &s;o that the mountains were covered, notwith|&s;tanding it was now mid&s;ummer, and the &s;un appeared almo&s;t eighteen hours in the four and twenty.</P>
<P>When the &s;torm had &s;ub&s;ided, Mon&s;. Bou|gainville formed the re&s;olution of going on a &s;econd expedition, which he flattered him&s;elf would be attended with more &s;ucce&s;s. Accord|ingly, early in the morning of the 27th (the barge of the Etoile, and the long-boat of the Boudeu&s;e, having been armed with &s;wivel guns and mu&s;kets) our adventurers embarked with the prince of Na&s;&s;au, and two other gentle|men, and &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Terra del Fue|go, where they arrived in about &s;ix hours; and finding a number of huts, which the natives had left in a delightful wood on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, they there &s;at down, and made a mo&s;t agreea|ble repa&s;t.</P>
<P>After dinner they coa&s;ted the country for a con&s;iderable time, and then cro&s;&s;ed an inlet, which Mon&s;. Bougainville conjectures to be a &s;treight which leads to the &s;ea, at no great di&s;|tance from Cape Horn. This conjecture is
<PB N="199" REF="203">
founded partly on the width of the inlet, which is not le&s;s than &s;ix miles, and partly on the ob|&s;erving a prodigious number of whales in that part of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>When our adventurers had almo&s;t reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the inlet, they &s;aw a num|ber of fires on the coa&s;t, and &s;oon afterwards di&s;covered &s;everal of the inhabitants on the point of a bay. Towards this place they immediately &s;teered; and they had no &s;ooner landed, than Mon&s;. Bougainville recollected, that the&s;e Indians were the &s;ame people whom he had &s;een on his former voyage in the &s;treights, and whom he had then di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Pecherais,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e &s;avages were perpetually making u&s;e of that word, in the &s;ame manner as the Patagonians did that of <HI>Shawa.</HI></P>
<P>The number of the Pecherais that had thus a&s;&s;embled was about forty, of both &s;exes, and all ages, and they had &s;everal canoes in an ad|jacent creek. As the evening advanced, Mon&s;. Bougainville could not &s;tay long with his old acquaintance, but left them, in order to reach an inlet, where he propo&s;ed to &s;pend the night; but as the time would not permit the accom|pli&s;hing his wi&s;h, he landed on the banks of a river, and having cau&s;ed tents to be made of the &s;ails of the boats, and a large fire to be made, the party &s;pent the night in perfect &s;afe|ty, and much to their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="204">On the following day it was found that the inlet above-mentioned was an excellent port, wherein &s;hips might be &s;heltered again&s;t every dangerous wind; and in which the ground is admirably calculated to afford the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t anchorage. From the elegance and con|venience of this bay and port it received the name of <HI>Beauba&s;&s;in</HI> [the beautiful harbour.] Mon&s;. Bougainville mentions this place as equally convenient for the careening of &s;hips, and for the taking in wood and water.</P>
<P>That no nece&s;&s;ary information re&s;pecting &s;o commodious a harbour might be lo&s;t, the Com|modore left Mon&s;. Bournard there, to take the mo&s;t exact account of every thing that might be thought worthy of notice, and he was then to return, in the long-boat, to the &s;hips. In the mean time Mon&s;. Bougainville and a part of his company embarked in the barge, and rowing to the we&s;tward, di&s;covered an i&s;land, on the coa&s;t of which &s;everal of the natives were employed in fi&s;hing. Before the evening our voyagers arrived at a bay, which received the name of <HI>de la Cormorandiere</HI>; from a rock which appeared at about a mile di&s;tant ftom it.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 29th Mon&s;. Bou|gainville departed from this bay, and &s;ailed be|tween two i&s;lands, to which he gave the name of the <HI>two Si&s;ters,</HI> they are &s;ituated about nine miles from Cape Forward. Soon after this they di&s;covered a mountain, of a conical
<FIGURE>

<HEAD>A Prospective View of the great Cascade in Cascade Bay.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="201" REF="206">
form, which they called the <HI>Sugar Loaf</HI>; and, in the cour&s;e of the day they arrived at a com|modious bay, at the bottom of it there is a mo&s;t excellent port, into which falls a very &s;in|gular ca&s;cade. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the place re|ceived the name of the <HI>Bay and Port of the Ca&s;|cade.</HI> It is repre&s;ented as a place highly proper for taking in wood and water, and very &s;afe to anchor in.</P>
<P>The &s;tream of a &s;mall river which &s;eeks its way between a number of lofty hills, forms this water-fall, which de&s;cends perpendicularly down the &s;ide of the rock above a hundred yards. Mon&s;. Bougainville went to the top of the ca&s;|cade, and made his remarks on the appearance of the adjacent country, in &s;ome parts of which there are &s;mall plains which produce a kind of &s;pungy mo&s;s, and in others the ground is co|vered with thickets of wood. The plants and trees are of the &s;ame kind as tho&s;e which the coa&s;t of Patagonia produces; and the whole face of the country has much the appearance of Falkland's i&s;lands, except the want of trees at the latter place. On the whole, our author &s;ays, that all that part of Terra del Fuego, from the pre&s;ent &s;pot, to that which lies oppo&s;ite Elizabeth i&s;land, con&s;i&s;ts only of large and mountainous i&s;lands, the &s;ummits of which are clothe dwith perpetual &s;now. Mon&s; Bougain|ville &s;earched in this place to find the traces of inhabitants, but he did not &s;ucceed; and he is
<PB N="202" REF="207">
of opinion, that the natives of Terra del Fuego &s;eldom, if ever, depart from the &s;ea &s;hores, be|cau&s;e on tho&s;e they obtain the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>Our adventurers remained at Port Ca&s;cade, during the night of the 29th, which was ren|dered highly di&s;agreeable by ince&s;&s;ant rain, and inten&s;e cold; and on the morning of the fol|lowing day they cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treight with a boi&s;|terous wind and a rough &s;ea, which rendered the navigation dangerous to &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el. The rain kept pouring down almo&s;t the whole of this day, which was employed in viewing the coa&s;t, and making &s;uch remarks as may be u&s;eful to future navigators. Our voyagers had now a very narrow e&s;cape with their lives, the boat having been nearly over&s;et in cro&s;&s;ing a bay, owing to a mi&s;take of the &s;teer&s;man in the management of the helm. At length, however, they got &s;afe on board the Boudeu&s;e, and as the commanding officer, during Mon&s;. Bougainville's ab&s;ence, had &s;hip|ped every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, preparations were immediately made for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>They departed from Bougainville Bay in the afternoon of the 31&s;t of December, 1767, and in the evening came to an anchor in the road of Port Galant, which is &s;ituated at the bottom of Forte&s;cue Bay, where they were detained no le&s;s than three weeks, by &s;uch bad weather, as the inhabitants of the&s;e milder climes cannot form an adequate idea of.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="208">On the fir&s;t of January, 1768, Mon&s;. Bou|gainville di&s;patched a party in a boat, to make remarks on the coa&s;t, as far as Elizabeth Bay; and to take a view of the numerous i&s;lands with which this part of the &s;treights of Ma|gellan abounds. Two of the&s;e i&s;lands, to which Sir John Narborough formerly gave the names of Charles and Monmouth, were di&s;|tinctly &s;een from the place where the &s;hips lay at anchor; but tho&s;e which he has denominated the Royal I&s;les, and Rupert I&s;land, were at too great a di&s;tance to be viewed from Mon&s;. Bou|gainville's pre&s;ent &s;tation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, and the almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant rains, the crew which had been &s;ent out landed on different places, at one of which it was evident, that &s;ome Engli&s;h &s;hips had lately touched; for on &s;everal trees they &s;aw initial letters, and even whole names, cut in the wood: they al&s;o &s;aw many &s;pice-laurel-trees, the bark of which had been lately taken off, with other plain indications who they were that had vi&s;ited the &s;pot, but what put the matter beyond all doubt, were the words, <HI>Chatham, March,</HI> 1766, which were very legi|ble on a piece of wood, of that kind which is frequently affixed to pieces of cloth in the royal marine warehou&s;es of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The a&s;tronomer, Mon&s;. Verron, in the mean time, had his a&s;tronomical in&s;truments convey|ed to a penin&s;ula, by which the harbour is
<PB N="204" REF="209">
formed, in order to make ob&s;ervations, for a&s;|certaining the bearing and di&s;tances of particu|lar capes: but the re&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations would afford neither in&s;truction nor entertain|ment to any but the mere nautical reader; nor would they be of the lea&s;t u&s;e even to him, unle&s;s he was bound on a voyage to the South Seas, through the &s;treights of Magellan.</P>
<P>The weather was &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;evere on the fourth and fifth of January, that no pen can de&s;cribe it, nor any imagination conceive an idea of it. A violent &s;torm of wind was at|tended with ince&s;&s;ant rain or &s;now, and the keene&s;t biting coldne&s;s in the air. Mon&s;. Bou|gainville informs us that, during this &s;evere weather, he &s;ent out a boat to &s;earch for a conve|nient anchoring-place on the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, and an excellent one was found to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Charles and Monmouth i&s;lands.</P>
<P>On the 6th the weather was more moderate than it had been for &s;ome days pa&s;t. In the morning of this day four &s;mall boats, with In|dians on board them, were ob&s;erved at the point of Cape Galant, one of which advanced towards Mon&s;. Bougainville's &s;hip, while the re&s;t rowed towards the bottom of the bay. In the boat which approached the Boudeu&s;e were a man, his wife, and two children, the former of whom went on board, without the lea&s;t ap|parent &s;ign of fear, leaving the woman and children in the boat. Soon after this man had
<PB N="205" REF="210">
gone on board, two Indians from the other boats followed his example, bringing their children with them.</P>
<P>The&s;e people &s;eemed not to expre&s;s the lea&s;t &s;urprize either at the &s;tructure of the &s;hip, or at any thing they &s;aw on board her, which our author deems a proof that, <Q REND="inline">"in order to be capable of being &s;urprized at the work of art, one mu&s;t have &s;ome fundamental ideas of it."</Q>&mdash;There may be &s;ome truth in this ob&s;ervation; but we cannot help re&s;olving the apparent want of curio&s;ity in the&s;e &s;avages into another, and a very different cau&s;e; namely, their having &s;een the Engli&s;h, or other ve&s;&s;els, which had vi&s;ited the &s;treights of Magellan.</P>
<P>The Commodore prevailed on the&s;e people to dance and &s;ing, and treated them with a kind of concert of mu&s;ic. He likewi&s;e gave them bread, and different kinds of meat, all of which they devoured with avidity, &s;eeming equally plea&s;ed with every thing that was given them, and with every occurrence that pa&s;&s;ed; nor could they be per&s;uaded to quit the &s;hip, till &s;everal pieces of &s;alt meat had been put into their boats.</P>
<P>Our author calls the&s;e happy Indians <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"trou|ble&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting gue&s;ts."</Q>&mdash;One would wonder on what authority he has adopted the&s;e epithets, or how the company of the <HI>&s;avages,</HI> as he calls them, could be trouble&s;ome or di&s;|gu&s;ting, when they &s;ang and danced, only on
<PB N="206" REF="211">
being a&s;ked to do &s;o; received with gratitude whatever was given them, and applied it to the purpo&s;e for which it was given.&mdash;Mon&s;. Bougainville calls them <Q REND="inline">"unpoli&s;hed men;"</Q> as if the frippery complai&s;ance of the court of Ver&s;ailles could have been expected from the&s;e hone&s;t tenants of the woods; who&s;e in&s;tructors are plain &s;en&s;e and nature, and who&s;e God is the God of the Europeans.&mdash;In a word, our author writes with an affected con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority, and in the pert re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;tile, that is almo&s;t peculiar to the French noveli&s;t who would be thought a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>The people are clothed with &s;eal-&s;kins, which are by far too &s;mall to cover the whole of the body; and with the&s;e &s;kins they make the &s;ails of their boats, and the coverings of their huts. They are likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a few of the &s;kins of the guanacoe, but our author does not mention to what u&s;e they apply them; though it &s;hould &s;eem probable that they form a part of their clothing.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville de&s;cribes the&s;e Indians as thin, &s;hort, and ugly; and that a mo&s;t offen|&s;ive &s;mell is the con&s;equence of keeping them company. The women are &s;till more di&s;agree|able than the men, who do not appear by any means fond of them. It is the duty of the fe|males to &s;teer the boats, and to repair any da|mage that may happen to them; and they are often obliged to &s;wim after them through the
<PB N="207" REF="212">
&s;ea-weeds; nor are even women who have &s;uck|ing children excu&s;ed this duty: the child is car|ried on the mother's back, enclo&s;ed in the &s;eal-&s;kin that forms her dre&s;s. When the women are on &s;hore their bu&s;ine&s;s is to collect &s;hells and wood; nor do the men even &s;hare with them in this employment.</P>
<P>The boats are con&s;tructed of the bark of trees, fa&s;tened together with ru&s;hes, and the &s;eams are caulked with mo&s;s. A fire is con&s;tantly kept in the middle of the boat, on a heap of &s;and, which is placed to prevent the burning of the ve&s;&s;el. Their arms con&s;i&s;t of bows and arrows formed of the branches of the berberry bu&s;h, which grows plentifully in the&s;e parts. The arrows are pointed with &s;harp &s;tones, and the &s;tring of the bow is made of the gut of &s;ome animal; but they u&s;e not the&s;e weapons again&s;t an enemy; they are de&s;tined only for the de&s;|truction of birds, or other animals proper for the &s;upport of life.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that the&s;e Indians u&s;e a kind of harpoon, for the purpo&s;e of &s;triking fi&s;h, which is made of bones, it is about twelve inches in length, pointed at the end, and indented on one of its &s;ides.</P>
<P>The principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e people is fi&s;h; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they &s;ometimes catch game, as they have dogs of the &s;porting kind, and &s;pringes, or noo&s;es, adapted for the &s;naring of quadrupeds. The teeth of all the
<PB N="208" REF="213">
natives are very bad, which our author attributes to their eating fi&s;h when boiling hot, though they do not half boil it before it is &s;o eaten. They live in huts which have no partition of rooms, in the middle of which a fire is lighted, that &s;erves the whole family.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e people is of the amia|ble kind; but their extreme good-nature bor|ders on weakne&s;s; they believe in evil genii, and have prie&s;ts and phy&s;icians, whom they &s;up|po&s;e capable of deprecating the vengeance of their aerial enemies. Mon&s;. Bougainville ob|&s;erves, that the&s;e <HI>Pecherais</HI> have the fewe&s;t con|veniences of life of any people he has ever known; yet they they do not repine at their &s;itua|tion, but appear to be contented with the lot which providence hath a&s;&s;igned them; tho' they live in the mo&s;t inclement climate hitherto di&s;|covered in the habitable globe. Exclu&s;ive of the other peculiarities of their fate, they are fewer in number than any other known race of men; yet this little &s;ociety, cut off as it is from all intercour&s;e with the re&s;t of mankind, is not totally free from the vices common to larger &s;tates, as a conte&s;t for dominion exi&s;ts even among them, and the more powerful are perpetually labouring to di&s;tre&s;s the weaker. Thus it is with the poor <HI>Pecherais,</HI> as with every other community in the univer&s;e, that tho&s;e who cannot make head again&s;t tyranny, mu&s;t &s;ubmit
<PB N="209" REF="214">
to the arbitrary command, the <HI>&s;ic voleo, &s;ic ju|beo</HI> of the tyrant.</P>
<P>The inclemency of the weather, during the 7th and 8th of the month, was &s;uch, that the crews of the &s;hips could not venture on &s;hore; and though it was even now the &s;ummer-time, the adjacent country was covered with &s;now, which al&s;o laid on the &s;hip to the depth of &s;e|veral inches.</P>
<P>On the ninth the Indians, who had previou&s;ly painted their bodies with red and white &s;treaks, advanced towards the &s;hips; but &s;eeing the boats go off towards their habitations, all of them, except one, followed the &s;hips boats, and that went on board the Etoile, where &s;he remained but a little while, and then followed the others.</P>
<P>The crews of the boats having landed, went to the huts of the Indians, who &s;eemed by no means to reli&s;h this unexpected vi&s;it; which was particularly evinced by the women having all retreated to one hut. The men invited the French &s;ailors into tho&s;e huts where the women were not to be found; and the Frenchmen having accepted the invitation, were treated with &s;hell-fi&s;h, which the Indians &s;ucked before they delivered them to their vi&s;itors. The be|haviour of the natives was lively, and they en|tertained their gue&s;ts with dancing and &s;inging: they revelled with uncontrouled delight, when,
<PB N="210" REF="215">
alas! their mirth was interrupted by an acci|dent as fatal as unexpected!</P>
<P>A boy, the &s;on of one of the Indians, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a di&s;order which occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions, and &s;pitting of blood. This child had been on board the Etoile, where the &s;eamen had pre&s;ented him with &s;ome pieces of gla&s;s; and as the&s;e Indians are accu&s;tomed to put things of this kind up their no&s;trils, and into their throats, it is &s;up|po&s;ed this youth had taken the &s;ame mea&s;ure, and that the fatal effects which followed were the con&s;equence of his having &s;wallowed the gla&s;s. It is here proper to remark, that the <HI>Pecherais</HI> con&s;ider the &s;wallowing of &s;ub&s;tances which re&s;emble gla&s;s, as a preventive remedy again&s;t certain di&s;orders to which they are liable.</P>
<P>The lips, palate, and gums of the boy were cut; and as he bled freely, the Indians conceiv|ed an idea that the Frenchmen had violated the rights of ho&s;pitality, and injured him, whom, by all the laws of honour, they were bound to treat with civility.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance gave ri&s;e to a jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t no way favourable to their European vi|&s;itors; indeed it appeared, that the Indians &s;u&s;|pected the French to have cau&s;ed the child's illne&s;s. A linen jacket having been given to this child by the French, he was &s;tript of it, and it was thrown at their feet; but it was in|&s;tantly
<PB N="211" REF="216">
&s;eized by an Indian, who did not &s;eem to dread the powers of enchantment.</P>
<P>The child being laid on his back, a conjurer knelt between his legs, and pre&s;&s;ing the body forcibly with his hands and head, uttered a num|ber of inarticulate vociferations. At repeated intervals during this ceremony he aro&s;e, and opening his hands, which had been before gra&s;ped, he blew in the air with his mouth, as if de&s;irous of driving away &s;ome evil genius. While this bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acting, an ancient woman bawled in the ears of the child, &s;o as almo&s;t to deafen him with her noi&s;e; and in|deed the remedy &s;eemed to be, in the literal phra&s;e, wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. The conjurer having retired for &s;ome time, returned in a new dre&s;s, and, with an air of triumph, renewed his incantations, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before. His hair had been powdered, and his head was di&s;tingui&s;hed by two wings, &s;imilar to tho&s;e with which Mercury is repre&s;ented by the painters. The life of the child now appearing to be even in more danger than before, the French Chaplain ha&s;tily baptized him, unob|&s;erved by the Indians.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange medley of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition was all this!&mdash;Mon&s;. Bougainville laughs at the folly of the Indian juggler, while he &s;eems to &s;peak in an applau&s;ive &s;train of the conduct of the French prie&s;t, which was
<PB N="212" REF="217">
certainly equally ridiculous with that of the Indian!</P>
<P>Some officers having repaired on board the &s;hip, and acquainted the Commodore with what was tran&s;acting, he went on &s;hore with the Sur|geon, who took &s;ome gruel and milk with him. When they came to the &s;pot, they found that the juggler was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by another per&s;on ha|bited like him&s;elf, and that the patient had &s;uf|fered much from their ab&s;urd attempts to relieve him; yet were the&s;e attempts continued, with|out any complaint on the part of the poor boy.</P>
<P>The affection of the parents, and indeed of the whole company of Indians, was manife&s;ted by floods of tears, and by many other ex|pre&s;&s;ions of grief; and when it was ob&s;erved, that the Frenchmen &s;eemed to &s;hare in their mi&s;|fortune, they appeared to be le&s;s diffident of the conduct of the &s;trangers; and at length they permitted the Surgeon to examine the mouth of the &s;ick youth, which being bloody, had been repeatedly &s;ucked by his father and another man.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the father accepted the gruel, and permitted his &s;on to drink &s;ome milk, but not till the French gentlemen had repeatedly ta&s;ted it in his pre&s;ence. The conjurers ap|peared to be jealous of the Surgeon, but they could not help confe&s;&s;ing the &s;uperiority of his abilities. It was remarked, that while one of the&s;e Indian phy&s;icians was endeavouring to
<PB N="213" REF="218">
drive away the di&s;order, the other was bu&s;ily employed in deprecating that vengeance, which they &s;uppo&s;ed the vi&s;it of the &s;trangers had oc|ca&s;ioned.</P>
<P>In the evening the child appeared to be le&s;s pained; but, from many circum&s;tances, it was thought, that he had &s;wallowed &s;ome pieces of gla&s;s. Mon&s;. Bougainville and the Surgeon now went on board, and it is conjectured, that the boy died about two o'clock the next morning; for &s;oon after that time loud cries were heard, and, at day-break, the Indians departed from a place which had been &s;o peculiarly fatal to them; for the lo&s;s of even one member of &s;o &s;mall a community, could not but be an object of great and public concern.</P>
<P>On the 13th and 14th the weather was &s;o bad, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to think of &s;ailing, and on the 15th the ve&s;&s;els were detained by a &s;trong contrary wind; but on the following day they &s;ailed, with a favourable breeze, which, however, &s;oon &s;hifted, and prevented their reaching Rupert i&s;land, off which it was Mon&s;. Bougainville's intention to have anchored. Af|ter a whole day of fatigue and danger they re|turned to Port Galant, and anchored again near their former &s;tation.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth the &s;torms were more violent than they had ever yet been; the &s;ea ran to a mountainous height, and the wind blew in &s;uch contrary directions, that the op|po&s;ing
<PB N="214" REF="219">
waves de&s;troyed each other. The &s;torm having in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ided before noon, a loud peal of thunder was pre&s;ently heard, after which the winds blew with increa&s;ing violence, and all the elements waged a &s;till more furious war. The anchors of the &s;hips having dragged, the top-ma&s;ts and lower-yards were &s;truck, to avoid the dreadful con&s;equences of the &s;torm. At this time, however, the &s;hrubs and plants were in bloom, and the trees were covered with a luxuriance of verdure.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t and the two following days the weather was extremely windy, while it rained and &s;nowed ince&s;&s;antly. The night of the 21&s;t indeed was moderately calm; but this calm &s;erved only as the prelude to a &s;torm, which de&s;cended with aggravated fury; &s;uch a &s;torm as the olde&s;t &s;ailor on board had never remem|bered; but its continuance was by no means pro|portioned to its violence.</P>
<P>On the 24th the weather being fine and &s;e|rene, preparations were made for &s;ailing, and on the following day the anchors were weighed, and the ve&s;&s;els got under way. Having arrived off Cape Quod, our Commodore &s;tops a mo|ment to de&s;cribe it. Its figure, he &s;ays, is very &s;ingular, con&s;i&s;ting of craggy rocks, the mo&s;t elevated of which bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the ruins of ancient buildings. From Bay Galant to this cape the verdant appearance of the trees takes off, in &s;ome degree, that horror,
<PB N="215" REF="220">
which would otherwi&s;e ari&s;e in the mind from the con&s;tant &s;ight of the &s;ummits of mountains which are always frozen. After pa&s;&s;ing Cape Quod, the face of the country is totally changed, both &s;ides of the &s;treight exhibiting a pro&s;pect of rocks, which are uncovered even with the &s;lighte&s;t layer of earth. The tops of the&s;e rocks are cloathed with eternal &s;now, while the vallies between them are choaked up with pro|digious quantities of ice, which have the ap|pearance of having been congealed for a long &s;eries of years. So dreadful is the appearance of this part of the &s;treight that Sir John Nar|borough gave it the name of <HI>De&s;olation of the South</HI>; and, in fact, it is de&s;olate and dreary beyond all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>When Mon&s;. Bougainville's &s;hip was oppo&s;ite Cape Quod, the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, di&s;tant upwards of forty miles, appeared as if terminated by a projecting cape. There are three capes on the continent, which our adven|turers called <HI>Etoile Cape, Boudeu&s;e Cape,</HI> and <HI>Split Cape</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cape Fendu,</HI> in the original.</NOTE>, the la&s;t of which is &s;o denomina|ted from its figure. The &s;treight, which in this part is about &s;ix miles wide, received the name of <HI>Long Reach</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Longue Rue.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the evening of the 26th was very fine, Mon&s;. Bougainville determined to continue his way under an ea&s;y &s;ail; but about two hours
<PB N="216" REF="221">
before midnight a thick fog came on, the wind aro&s;e, and the rain poured down in torrents, while it became &s;o exce&s;&s;ive dark, that no land could be &s;een. The &s;ituation of the &s;hips was now &s;uppo&s;ed to be oppo&s;ite Cape Monday; and the night was &s;pent in &s;tanding off and on &s;hore, in momentary expectation of &s;ome fatal accident</P>
<P>The land being &s;een at day-break, they hoi&s;ted additional &s;ails, and proceeded with ra|pidity, till they reached Cape Pillar, when they had &s;ight of the main ocean, into which they arrived under a full &s;ail, on the evening of the &s;ame day; having, by the advantage of thirty &s;ix hours fair wind, &s;ailed from port Galant into the great South Sea, without once coming to an anchor.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville was &s;even weeks and three days in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treights of Magellan, the whole length of which, from Cape Virgin Mary to Cape Pillar, he computes at about three hundred and forty miles.</P>
<P>Though the pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treights is a work of &s;ome difficulty and danger, our author recom|mends it as more &s;afe than the doubling of Cape Horn, if undertaken between the months of September and April; but, during the re&s;t of the year, he advi&s;es the pa&s;&s;ing through the open &s;ea; and he ob&s;erves, that the lo&s;t time in &s;ailing through the Magellanic Streights, is amply repaid by the conveniences of taking in
<PB N="217" REF="222">
wood and water, and the chance there is of the &s;curvy making le&s;s havock among a crew, when they have repeated opportunities of landing. He adds, that when he left the &s;treights he had not a &s;ingle invalid on board either of his ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a recital of the &s;everal circum&s;tances which aro&s;e, and the adventures he met with, from this period till his return to Europe; in which we &s;hall trace him with the utmo&s;t fidelity of the hi&s;|torian; pre&s;uming to differ from him whenever he appears to be mi&s;taken as a writer, or to act on wrong principles as a man.</P>
<P>Our Commodore now &s;ailed nearly a we&s;terly cour&s;e, having previou&s;ly agreed with the Cap|tain of the Etoile, that he &s;hould keep company with the Boudeu&s;e during the nights, and in the morning of each day &s;hould &s;ail as far as he could to the &s;outhward, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the other ve&s;&s;el, in order that the &s;hips might command as exten&s;ive a pro&s;pect as po&s;&s;ible, by which means it was hoped that &s;ome new di&s;|coveries might be made.</P>
<P>On the 30th of January, while the &s;ea ran very high, one of the crew of the Boudeu&s;e fell over-board, and was drowned, notwith|&s;tanding every endeavour to pre&s;erve his life.&mdash;From this time till the 17th of February, Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ailed in &s;earch of what is called
<PB N="218" REF="223">
Davis's Land, which was di&s;covered by our countryman of that name in the year 1686; and he &s;ays, that if he had followed the direc|tions laid down in Mon&s;. de Bellin's chart, he mu&s;t have &s;ailed over this land.</P>
<P>On the 17th &s;ea-gulls were &s;een; and as the&s;e birds do not go above eighty leagues from land, it was re&s;olved not to alter the cour&s;e of the &s;hips for three days; but within this period no land was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The we&s;terly wind, with a &s;light variation to the north and &s;outh, prevailed from the 23d of February to the 3d of March, during which time they had rain and thunder every day, im|mediately before, or &s;oon after the &s;un had reached the meridian. This variation of the wind, from what is commonly called the Trade-wind, is mentioned by Mon&s;. Bougainville as an extraordinary circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;hips had got clear of the &s;treights of Magellan, an epidemical &s;ore throat attacked almo&s;t every man on board, which was cured by putting vinegar and red hot bul|lets into the water ca&s;ks, &s;o that by the end of March, the whole crew were recovered. For &s;everal days after this period &s;uch a quan|tity of bonitos and other fi&s;h was catched, as afforded one meal daily to every man on board.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t a tunny fi&s;h was taken, in the belly of which were a number of &s;mall fi&s;h of
<PB N="219" REF="224">
&s;uch kinds, as are known not to &s;wim far out to &s;ea; whence it was concluded, that land could not be at any great di&s;tance; and on the following day this conjecture appeared to be well founded, for four very &s;mall i&s;lands were then di&s;covered, to which Mon&s;. Bougainville gave the name of <HI>les quatre Facardins</HI>; but as the&s;e were too much to the windward of the &s;hips, they held on their way, &s;teering for ano|ther i&s;land, which was almo&s;t right a-head.</P>
<P>As the ve&s;&s;els advanced towards this latter i&s;land, it was ob&s;erved, that it abounded with cocoa-nut trees, the fruit of which had a very tempting appearance. The&s;e trees grew on plats of gra&s;s, &s;trewed with an abundance of beautiful flowers; and the re&s;t of the i&s;land was clothed with trees of various kinds. Immen&s;e numbers of birds were &s;een on the coa&s;t, which was therefore &s;uppo&s;ed to afford a plenty of fi&s;h: but the &s;ea running high, and no harbour being di&s;covered, in which our voyagers might hope for protection from the fury of its waves, they were prevented from landing: when they had coa&s;ted the i&s;land for about two miles, they had &s;ight of three men, who advanced ha&s;tily towards the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville at fir&s;t imagined that the&s;e people were part of the crew of &s;ome European &s;hip, which had been wrecked on the coa&s;t; and, impre&s;&s;ed with this idea he gave, the nece&s;&s;ary orders for affording them the
<PB N="220" REF="225">
wi&s;hed for relief: but he &s;oon di&s;covered that his conjecture was ill-founded; for the people retired to the woods, from whence, in a &s;hort time, i&s;&s;ued a number of them, &s;uppo&s;ed to be near twenty, with long &s;laves in their hands, which they held up with an air of threatening and defiance. This being done, they retreated to the woods, in which, by the help of gla&s;&s;es, their habitations were plainly &s;een. The&s;e i&s;landers were of a copper complexion, and very tall.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville makes it a matter of won|der by what means the&s;e people were conveyed to this &s;olitary i&s;land, and how they are di&s;po&s;ed of when their increa&s;ing numbers render their &s;upport impo&s;&s;ible on a &s;pot, the circumference of which, he apprehends, does not exceed nine miles:&mdash;but our philo&s;opher &s;eems to forget that he has but ju&s;t left four other &s;mall i&s;lands; nor did he recollect, when he wrote his volume, that he was, in a &s;ub&s;equent page, to tell us that he had &s;oon afterwards di&s;covered a larger i&s;land, the inhabitants of which, for any thing he could tell, might have intercour&s;e with tho&s;e on the before-mentioned i&s;land. He &s;eems equally ignorant, whether the people of the&s;e i&s;lands are or are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ve&s;&s;els proper for conveying them from one to the other; and he has forgot likewi&s;e, which appears to be the greate&s;t blunder of all, that there may probably be, in this neighbourhood, &s;ome large continent,
<PB N="221" REF="226">
hitherto unknown to all our European naviga|tors. It is po&s;&s;ible our remarks may be as ab|&s;urd as Mon&s;. Bougainville's appear to be; but they &s;eem to ari&s;e naturally from the &s;ubject. Be this as it may; our Commodore named the above-mentioned place the <HI>I&s;le of Lance-bearers,</HI> from the &s;taves, or lances, which the inhabi|tants brandi&s;hed.</P>
<P>During the night between the 22d and 23d they had much rain, accompanied with violent thunder, while the wind blew almo&s;t a tempe&s;t. At the dawn of the morning land was di&s;co|vered, which appeared to be a regular level, &s;ufficiently clothed with verdure. Breakers being ob&s;erved on the coa&s;t, the &s;hips &s;tood out to &s;ea, till the weather becoming more calm, they might approach the &s;hore with greater &s;afety, which happening before noon, they then coa&s;ted the i&s;land, which is &s;haped like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, and its in&s;ide is filled by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Some parts of this i&s;land produce cocoa-nut and other trees, which afford a very agreeable &s;hade, but the greater part of it is only a &s;and, on which grows no kind of verdure. A num|ber of Indians were ob&s;erved in boats, &s;ome of them rowing, and others &s;ailing, on the lake formed by the &s;hape of the i&s;land. The&s;e peo|ple were all naked; and in the evening large numbers of them were &s;een on the &s;ea-&s;hore, with pikes in their hands, like tho&s;e with which
<PB N="222" REF="227">
the inhabitants of the I&s;le of Lance-bearers were armed.</P>
<P>Night advanced before any proper place was found for the &s;hip's boats to land; nor were they more &s;ucce&s;sful in their re&s;earches in the morning; wherefore they held on their cour&s;e, Mon&s;. Bougainville having called the place <HI>Harp I&s;land</HI>; the inhabitants of which had the ap|pearance of being tall, and genteelly made.</P>
<P>Our flippant Frenchman profe&s;&s;es to admire the courage of the&s;e i&s;landers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if they live unconcerned on the&s;e little &s;lips of &s;and,"</Q> which are every moment liable to be &s;unk in the aby&s;s of an enormous ocean. He might as well admire the courage of the inhabitants of France, the redoubted va&s;&s;als of <HI>Louis le Grand</HI>; who are not le&s;s liable to fall victims to a con|vul&s;ion of nature, nor under the more imme|diate protection of the Almighty, than the&s;e harmle&s;s tenants of a &s;olitary i&s;land; happily cut off, as they are, from an intercour&s;e with the more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;hed barbarians of Europe!</P>
<P>In the evening of the day on which Harp I&s;land was di&s;covered, they had &s;ight of other land, at the di&s;tance of &s;omething more than twenty miles, which had the appearance of be|ing, what it afterwards was found to be, a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, eleven of which were &s;een, and received the name of the <HI>Dangerous Archi|pelago.</HI> Our author conjectures, that they are more numerous, and ob&s;erves, that it is dan|gerous
<PB N="223" REF="228">
&s;ailing among them, as they are encom|pa&s;&s;ed with &s;hoals and breakers, through which a ve&s;&s;el ought to &s;teer with peculiar care.</P>
<P>The &s;hips now &s;tood to the &s;outh, and by the 28th of the month were out of &s;ight of all land. The clu&s;ter of i&s;lands above-mentioned were fir&s;t di&s;covered by <HI>Quir&ocirc;s,</HI> in the year 1606, and were again vi&s;ited by <HI>Roggewein,</HI> in the year 1722, who gave them the name of the <HI>La|byrinth.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing material happened from this time till towards the end of March, when the wea|ther was boi&s;terous and &s;tormy, to a very great degree, for &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and the &s;curvy now began to attack &s;everal of the crew. To combat the ill effects of this di&s;order, every invalid received, daily, a pint of lemonade, in which was infu&s;ed a powder, which had been frequently u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s during the voyage. About this time they were much in want of fre&s;h water, which was procured by the di&s;tilla|tion of &s;ea-water, according to a proce&s;s in|vented by Mon&s;. Poi&s;&s;onier; and the water thus procured was u&s;ed in boiling meat, and making broth. The bread was kneaded with &s;alt-water.</P>
<P>A &s;teep mountain, which appeared to be en|compa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea, was di&s;covered on the &s;e|cond of April, and received the name of the <HI>Boudoir,</HI> or <HI>Boudeu&s;e Peak,</HI> from that of Mon&s;. Bougainville's &s;hip.&mdash;Bearing to the northward
<PB N="224" REF="229">
of this peak, they had &s;ight of land, which ex|tended farther than the eye could reach.</P>
<P>By this time it was become highly nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;hips to put in at &s;ome port, where they might obtain refre&s;hments, and take in a &s;up|ply of wood. For the greater part of this day the weather was wholly calm; but in the evening a breeze &s;prung up, which conveyed the &s;hips near the newly-di&s;covered land; but it was thought prudent to &s;tand off and on for the night.</P>
<P>In the morning they had &s;ight of more land to the northward, but were not able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h whether it was another i&s;land, or a part of that which they had before &s;een.</P>
<P>In the night between the 3d and 4th of the month fires were ob&s;erved on &s;everal places, from whence it was conjectured, that the coun|try abounded with inhabitants. Ju&s;t before &s;un|ri&s;ing on the 4th, it was di&s;covered that the two lands, which had been &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;eparate i&s;lands, were connected by a flat country, bend|ing like a bow, and forming a fine bay. While the &s;hips were &s;tanding in towards the land, a boat was &s;een coming from the offing, which &s;oon afterwards cro&s;&s;ed a head of the &s;hip, and joined a number of other boats, which had a&s;|&s;embled from various parts of the i&s;land. This a&s;&s;emblage of boats was preceded by one which was rowed by twelve Indians, quite naked, who advanced towards the &s;ide of the &s;hip, and held
<PB N="225" REF="230">
up &s;ome boughs of the banana tree. Con&s;idering this as a token of friend&s;hip, our adventurers, in their turn, endeavoured to expre&s;s a recipro|cal regard.</P>
<P>This being done, the natives rowed along-&s;ide the Boudeu&s;e, and a rope being lowered into the boat, one of them affixed to his branch of the banana tree, a quantity of the fruit of that tree, and a &s;mall pig. This pre&s;ent was accepted, and, in return for it, Mon&s;. Bougain|ville gave them &s;ome handkerchiefs and caps; and thus was a friendly intercour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed with the&s;e people.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time upwards of a hundred boats &s;urrounded the French &s;hips, which were laden with bananas, cocoa-nuts, and various other kinds of fruit, highly acceptable to the French, who gave in exchange for them a number of toys, which proved equally acceptable to the Indians.&mdash;In order to carry on this traffic, our voyagers held up &s;uch articles as they meant to give for the fruit, and when the natives were &s;atisfied with the quantity which was offered, it was let down by the &s;hip's &s;ide in a net or ba&s;ket, and the Indians having taken it out, returned their commodities by the &s;ame con|veyance; but &s;ometimes the ba&s;ket was lowered when empty, and the natives put their effects in it before they had received the European goods, without &s;eeming to harbour the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t or jealou&s;y of tho&s;e with whom they dealt;

thereby giving the be&s;t proof of the integrity of their own hearts.</P>
<P>When the evening advanced, the &s;hips &s;tood out farther from the coa&s;t, and the natives rowed back to the &s;hore. During the night a number of fires were &s;een on the i&s;land, at &s;mall, and nearly equal di&s;tances from each other, which the French imagining to be illuminations in honour of them&s;elves, a number of &s;ky|rockets were fired from both the &s;hips, to return the compliment.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fifth the boats were &s;ent in &s;earch of an anchoring-place, while the day was &s;pent in plying to windward of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription which Mon&s;. Bougainville gives of the appearance of this place, as &s;een from the &s;hips, is very beautiful. The moun|tains, though of great height, are every where clothed with the fine&s;t verdure, even to the extreme point of their mo&s;t lofty &s;ummits: one peak, in particular, runs up to a mo&s;t enormous height, tapering gradually as it ri&s;es; yet is it every where clothed with the mo&s;t beautiful foliage, forming the appearance of a pyramid adorned with garlands, and carved by the hand of an ingenious &s;culptor. The lower lands con&s;i&s;t of an intermixture of woods and mea|dows, while the coa&s;t is a level ground, &s;hel|tered by the mountains, and abounding in co|coa nut and other trees, beneath the agreeable
<PB N="227" REF="232">
&s;hade of which are &s;ituated the hou&s;es of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>As Mon&s;. Bougainville coa&s;ted the i&s;land, he was charmed with the appearance of a noble ca&s;cade, which, falling immediately from the &s;ummit of a mountain, into the &s;ea, produced a mo&s;t elegant effect. On the &s;hore, very near to the fall of this ca&s;cade, was a little town, and the coa&s;t appeared to be free from break|ers. It was the wi&s;h of our adventurers to have ca&s;t their anchors within view of &s;uch an en|chanting pro&s;pect; but, after repeated &s;ound|ings, they found that the bottom con&s;i&s;ted only of rocks; and they were therefore under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking another anchoring-place.</P>
<P>Soon after the dawn of day the natives row|ed along-&s;ide the &s;hips, bringing with them fowls, pigeons, cloth, &s;hells, chi&s;&s;els, and other things, which they bartered for ear-rings, and pieces of iron. Both parties dealt with the &s;ame ea&s;e and mutual confidence as they had done on the preceding day; and among the number of vi&s;itors were &s;everal women, who&s;e cloaths barely &s;ufficed to hide tho&s;e charms which could not fail of attracting the ravi&s;hed eyes of the &s;eamen. One of the Indians &s;lept all night on board the Etoile, and &s;eemed not to entertain a &s;hadow of fear.</P>
<P>The &s;hips plied to windward during the night, and by the morning of the 6th they had nearly reached its mo&s;t northern extremity, when they
<PB N="228" REF="233">
di&s;covered another i&s;land; but as the pa&s;&s;age between the two i&s;lands appeared to be rendered dangerous by a number of breakers, Mon&s;. Bougainville came to a re&s;olution of returning to the bay which they had &s;een when they fir&s;t di&s;covered land, where he hoped to find a con|venient anchoring-place, and where, after dif|ferent &s;oundings, the &s;hips were at length &s;afely moored.</P>
<P>The natives now put off in their boats, and &s;urrounded the &s;hips in greater numbers than they had yet done, exhibiting many tokens of regard, and perpetually crying out <HI>Taio,</HI> which was afterwards found to &s;ignify <HI>Friend.</HI> The &s;trangers were much plea&s;ed with &s;ome nails and toys which the officers and &s;ailors gave them. The&s;e boats were crouded with women, who&s;e beauty of face was at lea&s;t equal to that of the ladies of Europe, and their &s;ymmetry of body much &s;uperior. Almo&s;t all of them were naked, the old men and women having taken previous care to dive&s;t them of tho&s;e coverings, which might otherwi&s;e have prevented their charms from taking the wi&s;hed effect.</P>
<P>The&s;e lovely la&s;&s;es eyed the &s;ailors with looks the mo&s;t emphatically expre&s;&s;ive, yet with a degree of timidity, which is at once the charac|teri&s;tic and the ornament of the &s;ex. It was not, however, nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e females &s;hould give any very plain indications of their meaning:&mdash;the Indian men &s;aved them this
<PB N="229" REF="234">
trouble, intimating, that the favours of the la|dies might be purcha&s;ed on ea&s;y terms: they even urged many of the &s;eamen re&s;pectively to make choice of a Dulcinea, with whom he would chu&s;e to retire to the &s;hore; and their ge&s;|tures appeared not le&s;s extravagant than tho&s;e of the &s;ame people, as recited by Dr. Hawke&s;|worth, in his account of Captain Cook's Voy|age, of which circum&s;tance the readers of the&s;e volumes is already appri&s;ed:&mdash;but Mon&s;. Bou|gainville goes beyond the Doctor, in the co|louring of this &s;cene. He &s;ays that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"even in tho&s;e countries where the ea&s;e of the gol|den age is &s;till in u&s;e, women &s;eem lea&s;t to de&s;ire what they mo&s;t with for."</Q></P>
<P>Be this as it may, the &s;ight of the&s;e enchant|ing dam&s;els operated very powerfully on the pa&s;|&s;ions of the &s;eamen; and, thus &s;ituated, it was no ea&s;y matter to keep to their duty, four hun|dred young fellows, who had not &s;een a woman for half a year before.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville and his officers did all in their power to pre&s;erve order and decorum, and to prevent any of the&s;e tempting creatures from coming into the &s;hip; but their efforts were un&s;ucce&s;sful:&mdash;one of them, notwith|&s;tanding every precaution, got on board, and took her &s;eat on the quarter-deck, near a hatch|way, which was open to give air to &s;ome of the crew who were heaving the cap&s;tern. She had &s;carcely &s;eated her&s;elf, when &s;he let fall a cloth
<PB N="230" REF="235">
that covered her, with an air of negligence, and appeared at once the Cyprian godde&s;s, to the ravi&s;hed eyes of the &s;pectators. Both &s;ea|men and marines now eagerly crouded to the hatchway; and the cap&s;tern was heaved with a chearfulne&s;s and expedition never known on any former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the officers &s;ucceeded in bringing the crew into &s;ome kind of order; though, as Mon&s;. Bougainville confe&s;&s;es, they found it equally difficult to re&s;train the ardor of their own pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;The Commodore's Cook, having eluded the vigilance of the officers, got from the &s;hip, and having &s;elected a mi&s;tre&s;s from one of the boats, went on &s;hore with her; where he had no &s;ooner arrived, than the na|tives crouded about him, and pulled off all his cloaths. They now examined, with curious at|tention, every part of his body, while he &s;tood trembling under their hands, in continual ap|prehen&s;ion of being murdered, or otherwi&s;e abu&s;ed: but his fears were ill-founded; for they had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed the examination, than they gave him back his cloaths, put into his pockets &s;everal things which they had taken out of them, and then introduced his girl to him, urging, that he would gratify tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which had impelled him to come on &s;hore: but alas! their per&s;ua&s;ions, their warme&s;t intreaties, were thrown away;&mdash;his fears had de&s;troyed all ideas of love, nor could even the enchanting
<PB N="231" REF="236">
beauty of his mi&s;tre&s;s recal them: the natives were obliged to take him back to the &s;hip, where he told Mon&s;. Bougainville, that he had nothing to fear from his anger, for he had late|ly &s;uffered &s;uch exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, that all other puni&s;hment would be comparatively light.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville and &s;ome of his officers now went on &s;hore to take a view of the water|ing-place, and were no &s;ooner landed, than the natives flocked around them in prodigious num|bers, regarding them with looks of inexpre&s;&s;i|ble curio&s;ity: &s;ome of them, bolder than the re&s;t, came and touched the French, and put a&s;ide their cloaths, to find if they were formed like them&s;elves. The happy i&s;landers, who wore no kind of arms, te&s;tified great plea&s;ure at this vi&s;it of our voyagers.</P>
<P>A per&s;on, who appeared to be the principal man among the Indians, took Mon&s;. Bougain|ville's party to his hou&s;e, where they found an old man, the father of the Chief, and &s;everal women. The&s;e la&s;t paid their compliments to the &s;trangers, by placing their hands on their brea&s;ts, and frequently repeating the word <HI>Tayo.</HI> The old man was a truly venerable fi|gure, who&s;e long white beard and hair added dignity to his per&s;on, which was exceedingly graceful and well formed. He had none of the decrepitude of age, no wrinkles on his face, and his body was nervous and fle&s;hy.&mdash;The be|haviour of this man was wholly different from
<PB N="232" REF="237">
that of all the re&s;t of his countrymen; for he expre&s;&s;ed no &s;ign of admiration or curio&s;ity, left the room without returning the compli|ments of his vi&s;itors, and with an air that te&s;|tified his unea&s;ine&s;s at their arrival. Mon&s;. Bougainville even imagines, that he feared that a new race of men coming to &s;ettle on the i&s;land, might di&s;turb that happy repo&s;e in which its in|habitants had hitherto lived.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of the Chief was about twenty feet in width, and eighty in length, and co|vered with thatch, from which hung a cylinder, above a yard long, formed of the twigs of the ozier, and adorned with black feathers. Two wooden figures were ob&s;erved, which Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays were idols, and that one of them was the god of the natives; but in this he mu&s;t be certainly mi&s;taken, as it appears from the account &s;ince publi&s;hed, that the inha|bitants of Otaheite are not idolaters:&mdash;but from almo&s;t every part of his volume it is evi|dent, that he has made his ob&s;ervations very ha&s;tily, and given a deci&s;ive opinion on &s;ubjects which he did not under&s;tand, and which he took very little pains to examine.</P>
<P>The figure which our author took for the god, was fixed upright again&s;t one of the pil|lars of the hou&s;e, and over again&s;t it &s;tood the other, which he calls the godde&s;s, leaning a|gain&s;t, and fa&s;tened to the reeds which form the walls of the hou&s;e. The&s;e figures &s;tood on
<PB N="233" REF="238">
pede&s;tals of hard, black wood, about two yards high, one yard in circumference, &s;haped like a tower, hollowed out, and carved.</P>
<P>The Chief having directed his gue&s;ts to &s;eat them&s;elves on a gra&s;s-plat in the front of his hou&s;e, he pre&s;ented them with a collation, con|&s;i&s;ting of broiled fi&s;h, water, and fruit. While they were regaling them&s;elves he produced two collars, formed of oziers, and adorned with &s;hark's teeth, and black feathers. The&s;e col|lars, which re&s;embled the prodigious large ruffs worn by the French in the reign of Francis the Fir&s;t, were put on the necks of Mon&s;. Bougain|ville, and a gentleman of his party. The Chief having likewi&s;e pre&s;ented our author with &s;ome pieces of cloth, the French were about to take their leave of this ho&s;pitable Indian, when one of them found that his pocket had been picked of his pi&s;tol; on which a complaint was made to the Chief, who immediately reprimanded &s;everal of his hou&s;hold, and would have &s;earched them all; but this the Commodore would not permit, contenting him&s;elf with intimating to the Chief, that the weapon which had been &s;tolen would kill the thief.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville was attended to the coa&s;t by the Chief and his whole family. As the company pa&s;&s;ed along, they ob&s;erved an Indian, remarkable for the fine proportion and &s;ymme|try of his figure, reclined at the foot of a tree, who prevailed on the French to &s;it down by
<PB N="234" REF="239">
him, and &s;ung them an excellent &s;ong, to the &s;low mu&s;ic of a flute, which the other Indian blew with his no&s;e. Our author &s;ays this &s;ong was, doubtle&s;s, of the anacreontic kind, but he a&s;&s;igns no rea&s;on for this opinion. This is de&s;cribed as a mo&s;t delightful &s;cene, and well worthy the pencil of the limner.</P>
<P>The company now proceeded to their boats, in which a few of the Indians embarked, and went to &s;pend the evening and &s;leep on board. The i&s;landers &s;eemed to be under no kind of re&s;traint, but to have the fulle&s;t confidence in the ho&s;pitality of the French, who treated them in a very elegant manner, and concluded the evening with a band of mu&s;ic, and a di&s;play of fire-works; at which, however, the Indians, &s;eemed more terrified than delighted.</P>
<P>The Chief went on board Mon&s;. Bougain|ville's &s;hip the following day, and took with him a pre&s;ent of &s;ome fowls and a hog: he likewi&s;e gave a full proof of the integrity of his heart, by returning the &s;tolen pi&s;tol; but this is no wonder; it may hold as an almo&s;t un|failing maxim, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the generous are always ju&s;t, that the knavi&s;h-part of mankind are to be found among the &s;ordid and avaricious."</Q> The generous &s;oul di&s;dains every act of mean|ne&s;s; and it is certainly an act of meanne&s;s to detain the property of another. Doubtle&s;s, the hi&s;tory of mankind will afford &s;ome in&s;tan|ces which militate very &s;trongly again&s;t this ar|gument;
<PB N="235" REF="240">
but it will u&s;ually be found, that when the man of liberal &s;entiments has detained what he knew to be the property of another, &s;uch deten&s;ion has ari&s;en from the extreme pe|nury of his own circum&s;tances.&mdash;We have in|&s;tances of robberies being committed on the highway, and the money returned, years after the perpetration of the fact. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;urely, the robber mu&s;t be allowed to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an hone&s;t heart, even while he was vio|lating the laws of his country; that his prin|ciples were ju&s;t and generous; and that what he conceived to be a ca&s;e of extreme nece&s;&s;ity; the &s;upport of his &s;inking credit, and the pre|&s;erving a beloved, an amiable woman, and the dear pledges of her love, from inevitable po|verty and ruin, was the occa&s;ion of his taking &s;o unwarrantable a &s;tep. The reader will ex|cu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion, in favour to the writer, who conceived that it aro&s;e naturally from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The name of the Chief, who&s;e conduct gave ri&s;e to the above reflections, was ERETI, who remained on board &s;everal hours, and then went on &s;hore with Mon&s;. Bougainville, who by this time had made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for landing the &s;ick, and filling the water-ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the boats had landed, the Com|modore fixed on a &s;pot on the borders of a ri|vulet, where he gave orders for the forming of a camp, for the protection as well of the &s;ick
<PB N="236" REF="241">
men and their attendants, as of the waterers, and others, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s might call them on &s;hore.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time Ereti beheld the marines un|der arms, and regarded the preparations which were making to form the camp, without any apparent &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s, and then took his leave. In a few hours, however, he returned, bringing with him his father, and &s;ome others of the mo&s;t eminent men on that part of the i&s;land, who remon&s;trated with Mon&s;. Bougain|ville on the impropriety and inju&s;tice of his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country; at the &s;ame time intimating, that his people were welcome to be on the i&s;land during the day, for any pe|riod of time he might think proper, but in|&s;i&s;ting, that the party &s;hould return on board every night. The Commodore, on the con|trary, as peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted that he would form the encampment, and endeavoured to convince the Indians how nece&s;&s;ary it was that he &s;hould do &s;o, in order to procure wood and water, and to have the better opportunity of trafficking with the i&s;landers.</P>
<P>The Indians now retired, and held a con|ference on the occa&s;ion, at the clo&s;e of which Ereti came to Mon&s;. Bougainville, and de&s;ired to know whether the French propo&s;ed to take up their re&s;idence on the i&s;land for life; and, if not, how long they intended to &s;tay.&mdash;In an&s;wer to this, the Commodore put eighteen &s;mall
<PB N="237" REF="242">
&s;tones into his hands, intimating, that he &s;hould remain there only &s;o manys days. Hereupon a third council was held, the re&s;ult of which was, that an elderly man, of great authority, was deputed to wait on the Commodore, and en|deavour to prevail on him to depart in nine days; which however he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to do, and thus the matter ended.</P>
<P>From this period the i&s;landers became again ea&s;y and happy. Ereti complimented Mon&s;. Bougainville with the u&s;e of a large building, that had been erected on the &s;ide of the rivu|let, for the purpo&s;e of laying up the Indian boats, which were in&s;tantly removed, at the command of the Chief. Under this building tents were put up for the accommodation of the &s;ick, and other tents for various u&s;es. A &s;ufficient number of mu&s;kets were carried on &s;hore, to arm thirty marines, all the workmen, and even the invalids, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t night on &s;hore, in company with Ereti, who added his &s;upper to that of the Commodore, invited a few &s;elect friends to partake of the repa&s;t, and gave orders that a croud of Indians, who&s;e curio&s;ity had brought them to the &s;pot, &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed. He then de&s;ired to &s;ee &s;ome fire-works, which he beheld with a mixture of plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;hment. Late in the evening he &s;ent for one of his wives, who &s;lept in the tent allotted to the u&s;e of the Prince of Na&s;&s;au.
<PB N="238" REF="243">
Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that this woman was ugly and old; but how does he know that &s;he was not the only wife of Ereti? It does not fol|low, becau&s;e a number of women were &s;een on the fir&s;t vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of this Chief, that he was married to them all. They might be daughters, &s;i&s;ters, aunts, nieces, or cou&s;ins, for any thing that could be known to the con|trary, by people who had not learnt three words of the language of the natives.</P>
<P>The camp was compleated on the following day, and the building entirely enclo&s;ed, except at one entrance, where a guard was con&s;tantly &s;tationed. None of the Indians were admitted into this building but Ereti, and his friends of both &s;exes. A croud of people were con&s;tantly about the place, but they made way for any one who had permi&s;&s;ion to enter, on the motion of a &s;mall &s;tick which a Frenchman held in his hand. To this place the natives a&s;&s;embled from all quarters, bringing poultry, hogs, fi&s;h, fruit, and cloth; in exchange for which they received buttons, beads, tools, nails, and trin|kets of various kinds, on which they appeared to &s;et a high value.</P>
<P>The&s;e benevolent i&s;landers vied with each other which &s;hould oblige their vi&s;itors mo&s;t; and when the French were ob&s;erved collecting &s;hells, and gathering plants, a number of wo|men and children in&s;tantly employed them&s;elves
<PB N="239" REF="244">
in the &s;ame manner, bringing the &s;ame plants, in great abundance, and variety of fine &s;hells.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now applied to Ereti, for information where he might cut wood, and was directed to the mountains, where the hard wood grows, the low lands producing only a gum-tree, and fruit-trees of various kinds. The Chief even marked the trees which were proper for cutting, and pointed out the &s;ide on which they &s;hould be felled.</P>
<P>The i&s;landers a&s;&s;i&s;ted our adventurers in cut|ting the wood, and carrying it down to the boats, and likewi&s;e helped them to fill water, and roll the ca&s;ks to the coa&s;t. For the&s;e &s;er|vices they received a number of nails, propor|tioned to the indu&s;try they had exerted: but it was nece&s;&s;ary for the French to be con&s;tantly on their guard, to prevent their thieving the ar|ticles which were brought on &s;hore; nor were even their pockets &s;afe from the depredations of the&s;e people, who, Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, are as ingenious in the art, as the pick-pockets of Europe; which is certainly no great compli|ment to the people of Otaheite.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;uppo&s;es, that the&s;e i&s;landers do not rob each other, as none of their effects were kept under locks and keys; and he attributes their frequent attempts to rob the French to an in&s;atiable curio&s;ity for articles which they had never before &s;een. Guards were &s;ta|tioned, and patroles appointed, to protect the
<PB N="240" REF="245">
French property; notwith&s;tanding which, the i&s;landers found means to &s;teal &s;everal things, and they even pelted the guards with &s;tones. The&s;e free-booters hid them&s;elves in a mar&s;h be|hind the camp, which was overgrown with reeds: but a part of this mar&s;h was cleared, by order of the Commodore, who directed, that when any more thieves were &s;een, they &s;hould be fired at. Ereti even hinted, that this mea|&s;ure was nece&s;&s;ary; but, pointing to his own hou&s;e, &s;eemed very &s;olicitous that Mon&s;. Bou|gainville would not fire that way. Orders were now given for &s;ome of the &s;hips boats to an|chor before the camp, and point their &s;wivel guns &s;o as to protect it.</P>
<P>The article of thieving excepted, every other intercour&s;e between the French and Indians was carried on in the mo&s;t harmonious manner. The &s;eamen made &s;everal incur&s;ions into the i&s;land, unarmed, &s;ometimes in &s;mall parties, and &s;ome|times &s;ingly: when the natives invited them into their hou&s;es, gave them provi&s;ions, and pre|&s;ented the young dam&s;els to their embraces. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the hut was in&s;tantly crouded with numbers of both &s;exes, who &s;urrounded the young lovers, and eyed them with looks of the mo&s;t inten&s;e curio&s;ity. Leaves and flowers were immediately &s;trewed on the ground, and while &s;ome played on flutes, others &s;ang a kind of &s;ong &s;acred to the Cyprian godde&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="246">Mon&s;. Bougainville's picture of the&s;e &s;cenes is rather over-charged; but the pen of the hi&s;|torian &s;hould be guided by truth. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here Venus (&s;ays he) is the godde&s;s of ho&s;pitality; her wor&s;hip does not admit of any my&s;teries, and every tribute paid to her is a fea&s;t for the whole nation."</Q></P>
<P>The people of Otaheite &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at the embarra&s;&s;ment of &s;ome of the Frenchmen on the&s;e occa&s;ions: but Mon&s;. Bougainville is of opinion, that there was not a man of the whole crew who had not got the better of the European delicacy, by making a public &s;acri|fice at the altar of Venus. If this opinion be well founded, the poor Cook, who&s;e ca&s;e has been related, mu&s;t have wonderfully recovered of his fright, before the Commodore left the i&s;land.&mdash;Surely the&s;e intrepid &s;ubjects of Louis the Fifteenth mu&s;t have been ble&s;t with the mo&s;t vigorous con&s;titutions in the univer&s;e, or have been cur&s;ed with the mo&s;t unblu&s;hing im|pudence of face! That many of the crew &s;hould have got the better of all regard for de|cency, is not to be wondered at; but that there &s;hould not be one Frenchman out of four hun|dred who could re&s;i&s;t the temptation of thus publickly pro&s;tituting him&s;elf, is very a&s;toni&s;h|ing. But vanity is con&s;titutional in a Pari&s;ian, and rather than not &s;acrifice at her &s;hrine, he will be content to rob him&s;elf of his own good name.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="247">It may fairly be concluded, that if <HI>every</HI> man gave the&s;e public proofs of his prowe&s;s, the Commodore him&s;elf made <HI>one</HI> of the number, a naked &s;pectacle to the laughing Indians! But perhaps Mon&s;. Bougainville was honoured in the embraces of one of Ereti's wives; in which ca&s;e it is pre&s;umed, that the fond couple were &s;urrounded only by the royal family, and the lords and ladies of the Court. Doubtle&s;s, an extraordinary band of mu&s;ic mu&s;t have been provided on the&s;e &s;olemn occa&s;ions, and the be&s;t no&s;e-flute-players on the i&s;land mu&s;t have been engaged as performers. What pity it is that our gallant philo&s;ophical, nautical, war|like Amoro&s;o, has omitted a de&s;cription of one of the&s;e charming &s;cenes! A print of it, too, would have done honour to &s;ome ingenious en|graver of Paris, and it would doubtle&s;s have promoted the &s;ale of a work &s;o admirably cal|culated for the meridian of Ver&s;ailles. The doating monarch would have &s;ub&s;cribed liberal|ly, while the la&s;civious Barr&eacute; would have ex|tolled to the very &s;kies the writer's happy talent at de&s;cription. Who knows too, but that the French Amba&s;&s;ador might have introduced the work among the circle at St. James's; and thus have promoted the cau&s;e of libertini&s;m &s;o far, that not one of the nobility of the &s;ucceeding generation &s;hould be the real child of his reput|ed father.</P>

<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a de|&s;cription of the beauties of the interior parts of the i&s;land. He has often walked out, with on|ly a few attendants, and arrived at places en|chanting beyond the power of pen or pencil to paint. Trees abounding with fruit of the mo&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="249">
delicious kinds, were frequently found on mea|dows inter&s;ected by rivulets, which gave an agreeable coolne&s;s to the air. On the&s;e enchant|ing &s;pots numbers of the natives revel in the profu&s;ive gifts of nature, unincumbered with the cares of the bu&s;y world. Our author met with many little &s;ocieties, repo&s;ing at their ea&s;e, under the &s;hade of trees, who welcomed the &s;trangers in the mo&s;t friendly manner. Tho&s;e he &s;aw on his way made room for his pa&s;&s;age, with a degree of civility that would have done honour to the mo&s;t poli&s;hed European; and in every place he found evident marks of the con|tent and happine&s;s of the people; while he was treated with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville gave Ereti &s;ome ducks and gee&s;e, and a couple of turkies, that he might rai&s;e a breed of tho&s;e birds. He likewi&s;e pre&s;ented him with &s;ome garden &s;eeds, and ad|vi&s;ed him to cultivate &s;ome ground in the Eu|ropean manner; and a &s;pot being fixed on by the French, it was enclo&s;ed, and &s;everal of the crew employed in digging it. The natives were much plea&s;ed with the implements of gar|dening, and happy in having wheat, barley, oats, rice, &amp;c. put into the ground; as were likewi&s;e onions, and a variety of pot-herbs. The Commodore is of opinion, that his gene|ro&s;ity in this particular will not be thrown away, as the people of Otaheite &s;eem to have a ta&s;te for agriculture; and he thinks they might &s;oon
<PB N="245" REF="250">
be brought to cultivate, in a proper manner, the fine&s;t &s;oil in the world: they have indeed a &s;ort of kitchen gardens near their huts, which produce yams, potatoes, and other edible roots.</P>
<P>Soon after the camp was formed, the Com|modore was vi&s;ited on board the &s;hip by <HI>Toutaa,</HI> the Chief of a di&s;trict near that of Ereti, who was a very tall man, and mo&s;t admirably well made, he was attended by &s;everal gentlemen, hardly one of whom was le&s;s than &s;ix feet in height. Toutaa brought with him cloth, hogs, fowls and fruit, which he pre&s;ented to Mon&s;. Bougainville, who complimented him with &s;ome &s;ilk &s;tuffs, trinkets, nails, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Toutaa invited Mon&s;. Bougainville to his hou&s;e, where, in the mid&s;t of a large a&s;&s;em|bly, he pre&s;ented him with a fine young girl, whom the Commodore conjectures to have been one of his wives; and the mu&s;icians in&s;tantly began the bridal hymn:&mdash;but our author does not &s;ay what farther pa&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>One of the Indians happening to be kil|led, his countrymen complained to Mon&s;. Bougainville of this violation of the rights of ho&s;pitality. The dead body being con|veyed to one of the huts, &s;ome per&s;ons were &s;ent to examine it, when it appeared, that he had fell by a gun-&s;hot wound; on which all po&s;&s;ible enquiry was made after the offender, but he could not be di&s;covered; and how he came to be &s;hot remained a my&s;tery; for Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that none of the crew had
<PB N="246" REF="251">
that day left the &s;hip with fire-arms, nor had any of tho&s;e on &s;hore been permitted to leave the camp. It was evident, however, that the natives in general conceived their countryman to have been the aggre&s;&s;or; for their dealings with the Europeans were not intermitted; but &s;ome few of them moved off their furniture to the mountains, and even the hou&s;e of Ereti was &s;tripped; but a few pre&s;ents from the Com|modore regained his friend&s;hip and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 12th the cable of the Boudeu&s;e parting, that &s;hip ran foul of the Etoile, but the ve&s;&s;els were happily got clear of each other, before any damage had been &s;u&s;tained. A boat was now &s;ent to &s;ound for &s;ome convenient pa&s;&s;age, as the &s;hips were in evident danger of being driven on &s;hore: and at this unfortunate juncture news arrived, that three of the Indians had been either mur|dered or wounded in their huts; and that, in con&s;equence of this unhappy circum&s;tance, a general terror had &s;eized the inhabitants. The women, children, and old men, had fled up the country, taking their effects with them, and even carrying off the bodies of the decea&s;ed. The Commodore, on receiving this intelligence, went on &s;hore, and &s;electing four marines, on whom re&s;ted the &s;u&s;picion of having perpetra|ted this foul deed, he ordered them to be put into irons in the pre&s;ence of Ereti, a circum&s;tance that re-conciliated the affection of the Indians.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="252">Mon&s;. Bougainville, apprehen&s;ive that the na|tives might revenge the injury they had &s;u&s;tained in the per&s;ons of their countrymen, &s;pent a con|&s;iderable part of the night at the camp, and gave orders for a reinforcement of the guards. It is true, that the &s;ituation of the French was every way &s;o advantageous, that, in all proba|bility, they might have been an over-match for the united forces of the natives. The night, however, was &s;pent in perfect repo&s;e, except &s;ome &s;light alarms, occa&s;ioned by thieving in|terlopers.</P>
<P>The Commodore's concern aro&s;e more from the apprehended lo&s;s of his &s;hips, than from any ho&s;tile efforts that might be made by the Indians. After ten at night the wind blew vio|lently; the &s;ea &s;welled to an enormous height; the rain de&s;cended in torrents, and the whole &s;cene was tempe&s;tuous in a high degree.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville went on board &s;oon after midnight, when a violent &s;quall of wind was driving the &s;hips towards the &s;hore. Providen|tially the &s;torm was &s;oon over, and a breeze from the &s;hore prevented the ve&s;&s;els being &s;tranded.</P>
<P>About day-break another cable, and the haw|&s;er of the Boudeu&s;e parted, when &s;he was almo&s;t clo&s;e on the &s;hore, on which the &s;urges beat with unremitting fury. At this time too, as an aggravation of their misfortunes, the buoys of the anchors were mi&s;&s;ing; but it is doubt|ful
<PB N="248" REF="253">
whether the natives had &s;tolen them, or whether they had &s;unk.</P>
<P>Some little time before noon another cable parted, and the Boudeu&s;e drove towards the &s;hore. They now let go their &s;heet anchor, but it could be of no &s;ervice to them, as they were &s;o near the breakers, that the &s;hip mu&s;t have &s;tranded before a &s;ufficient length of ca|ble could have been veered out, to have given the anchor time to reach the bottom. Thus &s;ituated, within a moment of de&s;pair, a wind off &s;hore operated in their favour; yet this wind &s;oon changed, though not till it had en|abled them to get at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore, by the help of a haw&s;er, from a &s;tream-anchor of the Etoile, which &s;hip happening to be an|chored in firmer ground than the Boudeu&s;e, was, under providence, the great means of &s;aving that ve&s;&s;el and her crew from de&s;truction. On occa&s;ion of this &s;ingular e&s;cape, Mon&s;. Bougainville pays a grateful compliment to Mon&s;. de la Giraudais, the Commander of the Etoile, to who&s;e friend&s;hip and abilities he deems him&s;elf greatly indebted for the pre&s;er|vation of the Boudeu&s;e.</P>
<P>Soon after day-light it was ob&s;erved, that the camp was totally de&s;titute of its u&s;ual vi&s;itors: not an Indian was to be &s;een near it, nor even a &s;ingle boat &s;ailing on the river. The natives had quitted their hou&s;es, and the whole coun|try appeared to be depopulated. The prince
<PB N="249" REF="254">
of Na&s;&s;au now went on &s;hore with a &s;mall party, and, at about three miles from the camp, found Ereti, with a con&s;iderable number of his &s;ubjects. When the Chief recollected the Prince, he advanced towards him with a mixed countenance, expre&s;&s;ive of hope and terror.</P>
<P>Many women were now with Ereti, who dropping on their knees at the feet of the Prince ki&s;&s;ed his hands, and, bathed in tears, exclaim|ed, <HI>Tayo, mat&eacute;?</HI></P>
<P>You are our friends, and you kill us!&mdash;</P>
<P>The Prince &s;ucceeded in his endeavours to in&s;pire them with fre&s;h confidence; and Mon&s;. Bougainville had the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving, from on board, by the help of his gla&s;&s;es, that the natives ha&s;tened to the camp, carrying with them fowls, fruits, &amp;c. &s;o that there could be no doubt but that peace was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Commodore in&s;tantly left the &s;hip, and taking with him a quantity of &s;ilk &s;tuffs, and a variety of other articles, he pre&s;ented them to the principal per&s;ons, intimating how unhappy he was on account of the misfortune which had happened, and a&s;&s;uring them, that the perpetra|tors of &s;o foul a deed &s;hould not e&s;cape un|puni&s;hed.&mdash;The grateful Indians care&s;&s;ed the Commander; the natives in general were hap|py that peace was re&s;tored, and the market &s;oon became more crouded than ever; &s;o that, in two days only, more refre&s;hments were brought in than had been before, and the whole place
<PB N="250" REF="255">
had the appearance of a fair. The Indians now reque&s;ted to &s;ee &s;ome mu&s;kets fired; but were not a little alarmed, when they found that the animals fired at were in&s;tantly killed.</P>
<P>The boat which the Commodore had &s;ent to &s;ound having found an excellent pa&s;&s;age to the northward, the Etoile &s;ailed on the 14th, and being got &s;afe without the reef, her Commander &s;ent the boat to the Boudeu&s;e, in which was an officer, who having &s;urveyed the pa&s;&s;age, and conducted the Etoile to a place of &s;afety, re|turned to take the &s;ame care of Mon&s;. Bou|gainville's &s;hip.</P>
<P>The crew of the Boudeu&s;e now laboured ince&s;&s;antly in compleating her &s;tock of water, and in bringing her effects on board. The Commodore took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, for his Sovereign, by an in&s;cription carved on an oak plank, and burying in a bottle, near the building they had occupied, a writing, con|taining the names of the &s;everal officers con|cerned in this expedition: and this method he followed invariably, at all the places he di&s;co|vered in the cour&s;e of his voyage.</P>
<P>The Boudeu&s;e &s;et &s;ail early in the morning of the 15th, and the Commodore congratulated him&s;elf on having got clear of the reefs, when the wind &s;uddenly dying away, the tide, and a &s;welling &s;ea drove the &s;hip violently towards the rocks, on which &s;he mu&s;t have been in|&s;tantly da&s;hed in pieces, and every man on
<PB N="251" REF="256">
board have peri&s;hed, except the few who could &s;wim remarkably well. At this moment, when &s;he was ready to &s;trike on the rocks, providen|tially a we&s;tern breeze &s;prang up, and, in about two hours, conveyed our voyagers clear of all tho&s;e dangers they had dreaded.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville joined the Etoile before the evening, and a &s;trong gale &s;pringing up about midnight, they &s;et all their &s;ails, and &s;oon got perfectly clear of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Our author now de&s;cribes, in very affecting terms, what pa&s;&s;ed at his taking leave of the people of Otaheite; and we &s;hall endeavour not to fall &s;hort of the original, in the tender|ne&s;s of the de&s;cription; convinced that the Engli&s;h language is at lea&s;t as well adapted for the pathetic, as the French, or any other Eu|ropean tongue.</P>
<P>Soon after the dawn of the morning, when the Indians ob&s;erved that their vi&s;itors were making preparations for their departure, Ereti came ha&s;tily on board, in the fir&s;t boat that was ready. He now cla&s;ped in his arms, em|braced, and wept over tho&s;e new-made ac|quaintance, whom he was about to part with for ever.&mdash;This &s;cene was &s;carcely ended, when a larger boat, in which were the wives of this generous Chief, came along-&s;ide the &s;hip, laden with a variety of refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>This ve&s;&s;el likewi&s;e brought off the Indian, who, on their fir&s;t arrival, had &s;lept on board
<PB N="252" REF="257">
the Etoile. This man was called AOTOUROU. Ereti pre&s;ented him to Mon&s;. Bougainville, inti|mating his determined re&s;olution to &s;ail with the &s;trangers, and intreating permi&s;&s;ion that he might do &s;o. This reque&s;t being complied with, Ereti pre&s;ented him to the officers re&s;pectively, &s;aying, that he tru&s;ted a well-beloved friend, to the care and protection of friends equally be|loved.</P>
<P>Ereti having accepted &s;ome pre&s;ents, return|ed to the boat, in which were a number of weeping beauties, made &s;till more lovely by their tears.&mdash;With him went Aotourou, to take a melancholy leave of a lovely dam&s;el, the dear object of his regard. He took three pearls from his ears, which he delivered as a love-token to the de&s;ponding beauty; embraced her affectionately, tore him&s;elf from her arms, and left it to time and tears, to re&s;tore her &s;erenity of mind.&mdash;Who that reads this narrative can &s;uppo&s;e, that an Indian has le&s;s dignity of &s;oul than an European!</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a de&s;crip|tion of the i&s;land of Otaheite, with an account of the manners and characters of its inhabi|tants; and in this part of his hi&s;tory we &s;hall trace him with the pen of accuracy.</P>
<P>There is a fine bay, about ten miles in depth, between a cape, which advances to the north, and the &s;outh-ea&s;t point of the i&s;land. Towards the bottom of this bay the coa&s;t is almo&s;t level,
<PB N="253" REF="258">
and this part appears to be the be&s;t peopled, as well as the mo&s;t agreeable part of the country. In a pa&s;&s;age between the two mo&s;t northerly i&s;lands, there is good anchorage for thirty ve&s;|&s;els. The re&s;t of the coa&s;t is mountainous land, and in mo&s;t places is encompa&s;&s;ed by reefs of rocks, &s;ome of which are almo&s;t covered by the &s;ea, while others are left &s;ufficiently de&s;titute of water to be con&s;idered as i&s;lands. On the&s;e the natives kindle fires every night, that the crews of their boats may fi&s;h in &s;afety. Between the&s;e rocks are &s;paces, through which a &s;hip may enter, but will find it difficult to get an|chorage.</P>
<P>The mountains at a di&s;tance from the coa&s;t are much higher than it is u&s;ual for hills to be in countries of no greater extent. The&s;e, being covered with verdure and fruits of various beautiful and delicious kinds, afford the riche&s;t pro&s;pect that the imagination can form an idea of. Springs, i&s;&s;uing from the mountains, form them&s;elves into rivulets, which meandring through the country, &s;erve at once to fertilize and adorn it.</P>
<P>On the level parts of the i&s;land the hou&s;es are erected, under the &s;hade of fruit trees; not in regular towns or villages, but &s;eparately, and where the fancy of the owner &s;hall fix the &s;pot. Public walks, kept in the neate&s;t order, lead from one re&s;idence to another, throughout the
<PB N="254" REF="259">
i&s;land, &s;o that the whole appears one &s;cene of enchanted ground.</P>
<P>The principal fruits of the i&s;land are plan|tains, cocoa-nuts, yams, cura&s;&s;ol okras, and the bread-fruit. Indico and &s;ugar-canes grow wild; and two &s;ub&s;tances proper for dying, one red and the other yellow, was found among the natives; but Mon&s;. Bougainville could not learn from what vegetable they were pro|duced.</P>
<P>While Aotourou was on board the Boudeu&s;e, it appeared, that he was acquainted with many of the plants and fruits in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, which he called by their Indian names. Indeed, the &s;ame productions are common to mo&s;t countries within the tropics.</P>
<P>The natives u&s;e the cedar-wood, which grows on the mountains, for the con&s;truction of the large&s;t boats; and they make a &s;ort of pikes, of a very heavy black wood. Their &s;maller boats are made of the wood of the bread-fruit tree, which is extremely &s;oft, and full of gum.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Otaheite produces very rich pearls, which are worn by the women and chil|dren; but the&s;e were &s;ecreted almo&s;t as &s;oon as the French landed, and were &s;een no more during their &s;tay. A &s;ort of ca&s;tanets, in&s;tru|ments u&s;ed by the Indian dancers, are formed out of the &s;hells of the pearl-oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>The only quadrupedes &s;een on the i&s;land were hogs, &s;mall but hand&s;ome dogs; and
<PB N="255" REF="260">
rats; the la&s;t of which are very numerous. Of winged animals there are parroquets of exqui&s;ite beauty, the feathers of which are red and blue, mo&s;t happily blended: pidgeons, rather larger than ours, of a deep blue colour, and mo&s;t delicate ta&s;te: and common dome&s;tic poultry, differing in no re&s;pect from tho&s;e of Europe. The hogs and fowls feed on plantains only, &s;o that the purity of their food mu&s;t en|&s;ure the goodne&s;s of the meat.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville obtained, by his traffick with the natives, about 140 hogs, and more than eight hundred fowls; and he might have procured much larger numbers, if his &s;tay had been longer.</P>
<P>No venomous animals were &s;een on this i&s;land, nor any of tho&s;e noxious in&s;ects, which are common to, and are the greate&s;t cur&s;e of, hot climates.</P>
<P>There can remain no doubt of the &s;alubrity of the air of Otaheite; for though the French laboured hard all day in the heat of the &s;un, and were frequently in the water, and &s;lept all night in the open air, on the bare ground, not a &s;ingle per&s;on contracted any di&s;order; while tho&s;e who were landed for the cure of the &s;curvy recovered very fa&s;t, and many of them acquired &s;o much &s;trength, that their cure was perfected on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="261">Our author mentions, as an undoubted proof of the healthine&s;s of the climate, the &s;trength of its inhabitants, who grow to an extreme old age, without feeling any of its inconve|niences, though they &s;leep only on a few leaves, &s;trewed on the ground, in huts ill adapted to defend them from the inclemencies of the weather.</P>
<P>The chief articles of food among the natives are fi&s;h and vegetables. Fle&s;h is &s;eldom eaten even by grown per&s;ons; and by the young women and children never. Their drink is pure water; and from this temperance doubtle&s;s ari&s;es, in a great mea&s;ure, that freedom from di&s;ea&s;e, which is one of their greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings. The&s;e people were aver&s;e to the ta&s;te and &s;mell of every thing &s;trong; particularly tobacco, &s;pices, brandy and wine.</P>
<P>The natives of Otaheite are of two di&s;tinct tribes, having no per&s;onal re&s;emblance, yet practi&s;ing the &s;ame cu&s;toms, a&s;&s;ociating together in the mo&s;t friendly manner, and conver&s;ing in the &s;ame dialect. The fir&s;t race of the&s;e peo|ple are much taller, larger, and better pro|portioned than the other. Few of the&s;e are le&s;s than &s;ix feet high, and &s;o extremely well made, that, as our author &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in order to paint a Hercules or a Mars, one could no where find &s;uch beautiful models."</Q> Their features are perfectly like tho&s;e of the inhabi|tants of Europe: their hair is black, and their
<PB N="257" REF="262">
&s;kins rather brown; but this is attributed to their being &s;o much expo&s;ed to the &s;un and air. Mon&s;. Bougainville does not &s;ay which of the European nations they re&s;emble, and therefore it mu&s;t be concluded, that he means the French; in which ca&s;e an Engli&s;h lady would &s;carcely give him credit for the extravagant encomiums which he lavi&s;hes on the beauty of the Otahei|teans; on the contrary, &s;he will be apt to con|clude, that better models for a Hercules or a Mars may be found between Berwick upon Tweed, and the lands-end in Cornwall.</P>
<P>The other tribe of the&s;e Indians are about the middle &s;tature, have almo&s;t the features and complexion of Mulattoes, and rough, curled hair, as &s;trong as the bri&s;tles of a hog. Ao|tourou was of this tribe, and the &s;on of one of the Chiefs of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Our author &s;ays that this Indian's want of per|&s;onal beauty, was amply recompen&s;ed by the goodne&s;s of his under&s;tanding; but this a&s;&s;er|tion has been flatly contradicted by the te&s;ti|mony of &s;everal Engli&s;h gentlemen, who &s;aw Aotourou, during his re&s;idence at Paris, and who repre&s;ent him as one of the mo&s;t ignorant blockheads they had ever known. Hence it &s;hould &s;eem, that Engli&s;h and French ideas are extremely at variance, re&s;pecting Indian abilities and attainments.</P>
<P>Both the tribes &s;have the upper part of the face, permitting the beard on the chin to grow,
<PB N="258" REF="263">
and a whi&s;ker on each lip. Some of them bind the hair on the top of the head, while others cut it &s;hort, but all of them rub the oil of the cocoa-nut into the hair and beard. They permit all their nails to grow to a great length, except that of the middle finger of the right hand. Among the&s;e people one cripple only was &s;een; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that he got his hurt by a fall. The Surgeon informed Mon&s;. Bougainville, that many of the natives were marked with the &s;mall pox: and he &s;ays, he took every precaution that the venereal di&s;|order &s;hould not be communicated to the&s;e happy, unoffending people; but it appears from Captain Cook's account, that &s;ome unge|nerous Frenchman was ba&s;e enough to plant this dreadful malady, in a country where, from Mon&s;. Bougainville's own account, it is more likely to &s;pread than in any other part of the world, on account of the extreme attachment of the inhabitants to the Cytherean &s;ports.&mdash;Aotourou is probably arrived at his native country before this time, and has informed the i&s;landers that their late vi&s;itors were French|men; in which ca&s;e the poor Indians will have ample rea&s;on to call the di&s;order by its genuine name, the FRENCH di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The ladies and gentlemen of Otaheite &s;tain the lower parts of their backs, and their thighs, with a deep blue; the method of doing which having been already mentioned in our account
<PB N="259" REF="264">
of Captain Cook's voyage, need not be here repeated. Mon&s;. Bougainville mentions it as a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that the practice of painting the body has always prevailed among the people of all countries, at the time when they bordered on a &s;tate of nature: it is, in|deed, a well known fact, that the ancient Bri|tons were found &s;tained with wood, when Ju|lius Cae&s;ar made his fir&s;t de&s;cent on this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The natives of Otaheite wear pearls, and flowers of different kinds, in their ears. They likewi&s;e make a frequent practice of bathing their bodies, con&s;tantly wa&s;hing them&s;elves be|fore they either eat or drink; &s;o that they are to be ranked among the mo&s;t cleanly people in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Our author repre&s;ents the&s;e i&s;landers as good-natured and benevolent in a high degree. He &s;ays, that, though the &s;everal di&s;tricts are go|verned each by its own Chief, public war, or private animo&s;ity &s;eemed to be equally unknown on the i&s;land. The natives &s;eem not to enter|tain even the &s;lighte&s;t doubt of the integrity of each other, and appear to enjoy, in common, whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of life. Their hou&s;es are always open night and day, and whoever enters may freely eat of whatever he finds. In like manner they gather fruit from every tree; and all the level country being a kind of continued orchard, &s;eems to be but one common property.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="265">Yet were the&s;e people, with &s;uch exalted ideas of general benevolence, mo&s;t dextrous in &s;tealing the property of the French. The Chiefs, however, did not encourage their in|feriors in the&s;e depredations; on the contrary, they reque&s;ted the officers to kill tho&s;e who &s;hould be detected in an act of theft: but they would never take this di&s;agreeable ta&s;k on them|&s;elves.&mdash;When a thief was pointed out to Ereti, he would run after till he had overtaken him, and then compelling him to re&s;tore the &s;tolen goods, he puni&s;hed the offence by a num|ber of &s;tripes.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, he had conceived an idea, that the&s;e people had no &s;everer pu|ni&s;hment among them than this kind of whip|ping; for they &s;eemed to commi&s;erate the fate of &s;ome of the French &s;eamen, whom they &s;aw put in irons; but our author has been &s;ince informed, that they have a cu&s;tom of puni&s;h|ing theft, by hanging the felon on a tree.</P>
<P>Although the inhabitants of Otaheite main|tain perpetual peace among them&s;elves; yet it &s;eldom happens, but that they are engaged in war with the natives of the adjacent i&s;lands.</P>
<P>They have large ve&s;&s;els, called Periaguas, in which they de&s;cend on the enemies country, and even engage in &s;ea-fights. A pike and a bow with a &s;ling are all their arms.</P>
<P>If Aotourou's information is to be depended on, the con&s;equences of their battles are very
<PB N="261" REF="266">
fatal to the vanqui&s;hed. The men and boys who are made pri&s;oners, are &s;tripped of their &s;kins, and the beards of the men are taken off, and carried away in triumph, as en&s;igns of the victory. The conquerors take with them the women and girls, with whom they frequently cohabit&mdash;Aotourou declared him&s;elf the &s;on of one of the&s;e unnatural alliances, his mother being a native of OOPOA, an i&s;land not far di&s;|tant from Otaheite, with the inhabitants of which they are frequently at war. Mon&s;. Bou|gainville a&s;cribes the difference ob&s;erved be|tween the two races of people, to this inter|cour&s;e with the captive women of the adjacent i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The principal people on the i&s;land have a number of &s;ervants, who &s;ubmit to their or|ders with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved obedience; and, in each di&s;trict, the will of the Chief is a law, from the authority of which there is no appeal; but the Chief him&s;elf does not come to any re&s;olution re&s;pecting matters of great import|ance, till he has previou&s;ly con&s;ulted with the principal inhabitants. The reader will recol|lect, that the truth of this circum&s;tance is evinced, by the repeated coun&s;els which were held on occa&s;ion of the French having deter|mined to take up their re&s;idence on &s;hore.</P>
<P>When an inhabitant of Otaheite dies, his body is depo&s;ited on a kind of bier, placed un|der a &s;hed, to which the women re&s;ort daily,

and anoint the corp&s;e with the oil of the cocoa-nut. In the&s;e places they are left, till all the fle&s;h is wa&s;ted from the bones, and then the &s;keleton is conveyed to the hut of his relations, where a per&s;on, who appears to have great au|thority, attends, and being dre&s;&s;ed in a habit peculiar to the occa&s;ion, he performs &s;ome &s;o|lemn ceremonies: but how long the &s;keletons are kept in the hou&s;es, our author had no op|portunity of knowing.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville endeavoured to learn of Aotourou the religious ceremonies of his coun|trymen; and, if they mutually under&s;tood each other, it will appear, that the people of Otaheite are &s;uper&s;titious in a high degree; that the &s;upreme authority is ve&s;ted in the prie&s;ts; that their principal Deity is called ERI-T-ERA, that is, <HI>King of Light,</HI> or <HI>of the Sun</HI>; be&s;ides whom they acknowledge a number of inferior divinities, &s;ome of whom produce evil, and others good: that the general name of the&s;e mini&s;tering &s;pirits is EATOUA; and that the natives &s;uppo&s;e two of the&s;e divinities attend each affair of con&s;equence in human life, de|termining its fate either advantageou&s;ly or other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>To one circum&s;tance our author &s;peaks in deci&s;ive terms. He &s;ays, that when the moon exhibits a certain a&s;pect, which bears the name of <HI>Malama Tamai,</HI> [the moon in a &s;tate of war] the natives offer up human &s;acrifices.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="268">Mon&s;. Bougainville mentions one circum|&s;tance, as a proof that the&s;e people originated on the continent, from whence their ance&s;tors mu&s;t have emigrated. When any one &s;neezes, his companions cry out, <HI>Evaroua-t-eatoua</HI>; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is, may the good genius awaken thee;"</Q> or, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"may not the evil genius lull thee a&s;leep."</Q></P>
<P>The principal people on the i&s;land appear to have many wives; and our author thinks polygamy is common among them all. The rich are chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the poor by keeping a greater number of the fair &s;ex; for univer&s;al love is the characteri&s;tic of the inha|bitants of Otaheite. Both the parents &s;eem eqally fond of nur&s;ing their infants. The men employ them&s;elves principally in war, fi&s;hing, and agriculture, while the women have little to do, but to render them&s;elves agreeable by their a&s;&s;iduity to plea&s;e: they &s;ubmit implicitly to the will of the men, and the woman who &s;hould pro&s;titute her&s;elf without the permi&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;band, would atone for her infidelity with her life. Yet is the permi&s;&s;ion of the hu&s;band to gratify her pa&s;&s;ions, in what way &s;he plea&s;e, &s;o ea&s;ily obtained, that the&s;e fair ones are not under the lea&s;t temptation to di&s;obedience: in fact, the wife generally yields her per&s;on at the &s;olicitation of her hu&s;band; jealou&s;y, therefore, one would imagine, mu&s;t be a pa&s;&s;ion quite un|known among them.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269">The &s;ingle woman follows, implicitly, the dictates of her heart, and yields her per&s;on at her own di&s;cretion; and, the more numerous the favours &s;he has granted, the better her chance of obtaining a hu&s;band. The examples perpe|tually before her eyes, the hymeneal &s;ongs of the natives, their dances, and their attitudes, added to the &s;eductive warmth of the climate, all con&s;pire to render that circum&s;tance no vice at Otaheite, which would be deemed &s;o in Eng|land. Love is at once the bu&s;ine&s;s and the plea&s;ure of the natives of this i&s;land; and at his &s;hrine, all its inhabitants bend with the mo&s;t fervent devotion. They dance to the mu&s;ic of a drum, and &s;ing to the flute blown with the no&s;e. They likewi&s;e divert them&s;elves, occa|&s;ionally, with a kind of wre&s;tling, which at once braces the nerves, and relaxes the mind; though in this place, of all parts of the world, the mind &s;eems to require the lea&s;t relaxation, for almo&s;t the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the i&s;landers con&s;i&s;ts in plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our author &s;ays, that the inhabitants of Otaheite are a witty and humorous people, which he attributes to their living in ea&s;e and jollity.&mdash;That ea&s;e may make a man happy, we will readily allow; but that it can create humour, or in&s;pire wit, we mu&s;t beg leave to deny:&mdash;per|haps the dulle&s;t fellows this day to be found on the habitable globe, are among tho&s;e who are ea&s;y and independant in point of fortune, and
<PB N="265" REF="270">
perhaps, too, &s;ome of the mo&s;t humorous and witty may be found among tho&s;e who know not where to obtain a &s;econd &s;hilling when the pre&s;ent is expended. This, at lea&s;t, is the ca&s;e in London: it may, po&s;&s;ibly, fare differently with the Pari&s;ians, almo&s;t all of whom being poor and merry, may fancy them&s;elves wits and humouri&s;ts. In a word, wit and humour are not the gifts of fortune, but of Nature.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville charges the people of Otaheite with a ficklene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which was deemed a&s;toni&s;hing. Every new object &s;truck their attention, but nothing engaged it for more than a few minutes. To reflect was, to them, a work of labour, and they &s;eemed to prefer bodily to mental exerci&s;es.&mdash;This, with our ingenious author's permi&s;&s;ion, is a proof of their good &s;en&s;e: every man, who can think at all, mu&s;t know, that the labour of the mind exceeds that of the limbs, in proportion as the &s;oul is &s;uperior to the body! For this rea&s;on we pay not an arti&s;t as we pay a porter; the one will earn an hundred pounds, while the other is drudging for as many &s;hillings: but the porter can drudge on for life, while the arti&s;t, if he acquire not &s;ufficient to retire with decency at an early period, will pine away a wretched old age in unmerited penury!</P>
<P>The natives of Otaheite are ingenious, be|yond de&s;cription, in the con&s;truction of their fi&s;hing-tackle, the hooks of which are of mo|ther
<PB N="266" REF="271">
of pearl, and wrought as nicely as if with European tools. With threads drawn from the American aloe they form their nets, which are made like tho&s;e of France, and other nations of Europe. Their hou&s;es, too, are exceedingly well built, and the palm-leaves, with which they are thatched, are laid on with great &s;kill and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The boats (or periaguas) of the&s;e people are of two kinds. The former very large, hollow|ed out of huge trees, and fini&s;hed with much ta&s;te, parts of other trees being added as or|naments:&mdash;the latter &s;mall, and of much ruder con&s;truction&mdash;But the&s;e kinds of boats having been repeatedly de&s;cribed in this and other books of voyages, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more of them.</P>
<P>In order to convey them&s;elves from one i&s;land to another, they fix beams of wood from the &s;tarboard &s;ide of one ve&s;&s;el to the larboard of the other, leaving an intermediate &s;pace of &s;omething more than a yard; and over the &s;tern of both the boats they erect a kind of hut, lightly built, and covered with reeds, which &s;erves as a repo&s;itory for their provi&s;ions, and a &s;helter again&s;t the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P>Two boats thus la&s;hed together never over|&s;et; and are therefore much in u&s;e among the people of &s;uperior rank: the &s;ails of the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els
<PB N="267" REF="272">
are nearly &s;quare, and con&s;i&s;t of mats, &s;tretched out by means of pieces of cane.</P>
<P>The only tools in u&s;e among the natives of Otaheite are pieces of &s;hells made &s;harp, for boring holes in wood, and a chi&s;&s;el, in the Eu|ropean make, the blade of which is formed of a hard black &s;tone.</P>
<P>The natives manufacture that remarkable kind of cloth which forms their dre&s;s: a &s;hrub is cultivated near all the Indian huts, from the rind of which this cloth is made, by beating it on a &s;mooth board, and occa&s;ionally &s;prinkling it with water, till it is as thin as paper, and &s;omething like it, only much more pliable. Thus they make cloth of different thickne&s;s, which they afterwards dye; but their proce&s;s in the dying it Mon&s;. Bougainville had no op|portunity of &s;eeing.</P>
<P>Our author now employs two or three pages in defence of his conduct in bringing Aotourou from his native i&s;land, in an&s;wer to &s;ome illibe|ral reflections which had been ca&s;t on him; and then he proceeds to de&s;cribe &s;ome particulars of the Indian's behaviour during his re&s;idence. This account &s;hould certainly have appeared as a &s;upplement to the Volume; but we take it as it &s;tands.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays he endeavoured, at a great trouble and expence, to render Aotou|rou's re&s;idence at Paris both improving and en|tertaining to him. The curio&s;ity of the public
<PB N="268" REF="273">
to view this &s;tranger was in&s;atiable; and the fooli&s;h Pari&s;ians were a&s;toni&s;hed to learn, that there was any country on the face of the earth, where neither French, Engli&s;h, nor Spani&s;h was &s;poken. Mon&s;. Bougainville happily ridi|cules this &s;trange kind of ignorance; but he does not &s;eem to wonder, that it &s;hould prevail among tho&s;e who had never been without the walls of the city which gave them birth.</P>
<P>Our author is likewi&s;e very &s;evere on a &s;et of critics, who &s;eemed to wonder that Aotourou could live among Frenchmen almo&s;t two years, and yet learn only a very few words of their language. To account for this, Mon&s;. Bou|gainville mentions a phy&s;ical ob&s;truction in the organs of his &s;peech; his age, which rather exceeded thirty years; the deficiency of a me|mory never exerci&s;ed by &s;tudy; and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing only a very limited number of ideas, relative to the trifling wants of the natives of his happy i&s;land. Hence our author concludes, that he mu&s;t fir&s;t of all have created <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a world of previous ideas, in a mind as indolent as his body",</Q> before he could adapt them to the French words proper to expre&s;s them.</P>
<P>Though Aotourou was thus deficient in the language of France, yet the &s;treets of Paris were quite familiar to him. He went out daily without attendants, and found his way readily through the whole city. He frequently bought things, and was &s;eldom defrauded in the pur|cha&s;e.
<PB N="269" REF="274">
None of the public diver&s;ions had any charms for him but the opera, to which he went regularly: for he knew the nights on which it was to be performed, and paid the &s;ame for ad|mittance as other people: his great fondne&s;s for dancing was what rendered the opera &s;o a|greeable to him.</P>
<P>He was exceedingly grateful to tho&s;e who conferred any obligations on him, nor did he ever forget their per&s;ons or their favours. The dutche&s;s of Choi&s;eul &s;tood foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of his friends, and he expre&s;&s;ed more gratitude for the polite attention with which &s;he treated him, than even for the numerous pre&s;ents which he received at her hands: and as often as he heard of that lady's being arrived from her country-&s;eat, he would immediately go and vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>After a re&s;idence of eleven months at Paris, Aotourou was put on board the Bri&s;&s;on, at Ro|chelle, which &s;hip was de&s;tined to convey him to the i&s;le of France, whither orders were &s;ent to the Governor and intendant, to tran&s;port him thence to his own country. Mon&s;. Bougainville gave about 1500 l. &s;terling, towards the fitting out the Bri&s;&s;on for this voyage; and the Dut|che&s;s of Choi&s;eul ordered a con&s;iderable &s;um to be expended in cattle, &s;eeds, implements of hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. which were &s;hipped for the u&s;e of the natives of Otaheite. Mon&s;. Bou|gainville concludes this part of his narrative
<PB N="270" REF="275">
with the following very humane and equally political wi&s;h. <Q REND="inline">"O may Aotourou &s;oon &s;ee his countrymen again!"</Q></P>
<P>Our author now proceeds to inform us of &s;everal particulars, with which his conver&s;ation with this adventrous i&s;lander had made him acquainted. If Mon&s;. Bougainville be not mi&s;led in his information, the &s;tate of facts will appear to be, that the inhabitants of Ota|heite pay their devotions to the Deity, at the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un; that their &s;upreme God is incapable of repre&s;entation; but that they have two cla&s;&s;es of inferior deities, who are repre&s;ented by figures carved in wood. Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e regular devotions, the na|tives of Otaheite practice a number of &s;uper|&s;titious ceremonies, in order to avert the in|fluence of the evil genii.</P>
<P>While Aotourou was at Paris, in 1769, a comet appeared, which furni&s;hed Mon&s;. Bou|gainville with an opportunity of knowing that the&s;e kind of &s;tars had been frequently ob&s;erved at Otaheite; but that the natives do not &s;up|po&s;e that they are portentous of any evil con|&s;equence; on the contrary, what we call &s;hoot|ing &s;tars, are, by the&s;e people, deemed evil genii.&mdash;How far it was po&s;&s;ible for Aotourou to explain him&s;elf to Mon&s;. Bougainville, on a&s;tronomical &s;ubjects, is left to the reader's re|flection.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="276">The more enlightened people of Otaheite have names for the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars; by which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the needle or compa&s;s, they &s;teer their cour&s;e night and day, &s;ailing, at &s;ome times, not le&s;s than eight hun|dred miles from i&s;land to i&s;land. In the day|time they are guided by the &s;un, and by the &s;tars in the night.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville learnt from Aotourou the names of &s;everal i&s;lands, in the &s;eas near Otaheite, the natives of &s;ome of which were in friend&s;hip, and tho&s;e of others at war, with his countrymen. Of the former are Tapoua|ma&s;&s;ou, Oumaitia, Aca, Maoroua, and Ai|meo; of the latter, Oopoa, Toumaraa, Otaa, Aiatea, and Papara; all which are repre&s;ented as about equal in extent with Otaheite.</P>
<P>There is an i&s;land, called Pare, the inhabi|tants of which are alternately at war and in friend&s;hip with the natives of Otaheite. In the&s;e &s;eas are likewi&s;e two &s;mall i&s;lands, called Toupai, and Enoua-Motou, which are not in|habited, but yield abundance of fruit, fowls, and hogs, while their coa&s;ts abound with tur|tle, and other fi&s;h; but the people of Ota|heite conceiving the&s;e i&s;lands to be the re&s;idence of evil genii, deem it a certain &s;ign of mi&s;|fortune, if either curio&s;ity or chance &s;hould lead any boat to their coa&s;ts; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who endeavour to land there will peri&s;h in the attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277">The mo&s;t di&s;tant of all the i&s;lands above|mentioned is not more than about fifteen days &s;ail from Otaheite, even with the boats of that i&s;land; and Mon&s;. Bougainville conjectures, that Aotourou had no idea of going farther when he embarked on board the Boudeu&s;e.&mdash;If this conjecture be well founded, there cer|tainly was not &s;o much magnanimity in this In|dian's behaviour as we have been hitherto taught to believe:&mdash;but there are great incon&s;i&s;tencies in the writings of our voyager, which the rea|der will pardon, in favour of his vanity. It is our duty to correct and amend as we proceed.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville at fir&s;t imagined, that the inhabitants of Otaheite were nearly equal in point of rank, and that their happine&s;s was to be envied, from their &s;uppo&s;ed equality: but he now, from the information of Aotourou, corrects that error, and confe&s;&s;es that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the di&s;tinction of ranks is very great,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the di&s;proportion very tyrannical."</Q>&mdash;The Chiefs, and other men in power, di&s;po&s;e of the lives of their dependants at their plea&s;ure; and our author thinks, that they have the power of ex|erting this cruel prerogative over the common people, who are not immediately dependant on them. The vulgar are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Tata einow,</HI> that is, vile men; and it is mentioned, as an indubitable fact, that tho&s;e doomed for &s;acrifices are &s;elected from the Plebeian race. The Grandees only eat fi&s;h
<PB N="281" REF="278">
and fle&s;h, while the common people &s;ub&s;i&s;t entirely on pul&s;e and fruits. Indeed the di&s;|tinction of rank appears to be very great; for per&s;ons of eminence are lighted from place to place in the night, with a wood of &s;uperior quality to that which the vulgar are allowed to burn. The tree called the weeping willow is planted only before the hou&s;es of the Chiefs or Kings, and their public dinners are held be|neath its &s;hade.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants of the great men are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a kind of &s;a&s;h, worn round the body, which is placed acro&s;s the loins, or high|er up, till it comes clo&s;e under the arm-pits, in proportion to the rank of the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The natives of Otaheite make two regular meals daily, one ju&s;t after noon, and the other as &s;oon as the &s;un is gone down. The &s;ervants cook the victuals, which are &s;erved up by the wives, who eat after their hu&s;bands have done.</P>
<P>When the men die, the women go into mourning for them; but this compliment is not returned on the part of the men. The chil|dren wear mourning a long time after the death of the father, and on the decea&s;e of a king, the whole nation is in &s;ables. The mourning con&s;i&s;ts of a head-dre&s;s of black feathers, and a veil drawn over the face.</P>
<P>Aotourou informed Mon&s;. Bougainville, that this veil was very favourable to the wi&s;hes of tho&s;e women who&s;e hu&s;bands were not &s;o com|plai&s;ant
<PB N="282" REF="279">
as his countrymen in general are. This ari&s;es from the following circum&s;tance. When the mourners go out, a number of &s;laves walk before them, beating the ca&s;tanets to a &s;olemn melancholy tune, which is con&s;idered as a notice for all per&s;ons to keep at a di&s;tance from the afflicted: thus, the veil over the face, and the &s;ound of an in&s;trument from which every one flies, cannot but be au&s;picious to the wi&s;h|es of the enraptured lovers.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on is dangerou&s;ly ill, all his relations repair to his hou&s;e, and remain there till he is either dead or out of danger, each, in his turn, attending the &s;ick man. Their me|thod of bleeding is very &s;ingular. An inferior prie&s;t, called <HI>Taoua,</HI> is the phy&s;ician, who &s;trikes the cranium with a piece of &s;harp wood, which opens the &s;agittal vein; and when he deems the patient to have bled &s;ufficiently, he ties on a bandage, which clo&s;es the orifice; the day following he wa&s;hes the wound, and no ill con&s;equence en&s;ues.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that the preceding account contains every thing he could learn re|&s;pecting the cu&s;toms of Otaheite, either on the i&s;land, or from the information of Aotourou. Our author remarks, that &s;ome words &s;poken by the natives of Otaheite, are to be found in a vocabulary at the end of La Maire's voyage, under the title of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vocabulary of Cocos i&s;land",</Q> which being mentioned as lying
<PB N="283" REF="280">
nearly in the &s;ame latitude with Otaheite, is conjectured to be one of tho&s;e i&s;lands, the names of which were recited by Aotourou.</P>
<P>The language of the people of Otaheite is de&s;cribed by Mon&s;. Bougainville as extremely harmonious, and ea&s;y of pronunciation, con|&s;i&s;ting chiefly of vowels, and having no a&s;pi|rates. He &s;ays al&s;o that it has no na&s;al, mute, or half &s;yllables; nor <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that quantity of con|&s;onants and articulations, which render &s;ome languages &s;o difficult."</Q> Hence, he concludes, aro&s;e the difficulty of teaching Aotourou the French tongue; but he thinks it would have been a work of much le&s;s labour to have taught him the Italian or Spani&s;h.</P>
<P>How far our author is right in his conjectures, it would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k to determine; for the direct contrary of what he &s;ays of the language of the&s;e i&s;landers has been ob&s;erved by the Engli&s;h navigators. As we have already given &s;ome vocabularies, we &s;hall, at the conclu&s;ion of this narrative, give that of Mon&s;. Bougain|ville, that the reader may determine whether the Engli&s;h or the French voyagers have the be&s;t preten&s;ions to credibility.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville informs us, that a gen|tleman of Paris, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;kill in teaching the art of &s;peech to per&s;ons born deaf and dumb, repeatedly examined Aotourou, and found that he could not naturally pronounce
<PB N="284" REF="281">
any of the French na&s;al vowels, and but very few of the con&s;onants.</P>
<P>Our author is of opinion, that the language of Otaheite is &s;ufficiently copious, and he grounds this opinion on the following circum|&s;tances. Whenever, during the voyage, Ao|tourou was &s;truck with any new object, he im|mediately expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments in a kind of extempore blank ver&s;e; and he al&s;o repeated daily a long prayer, which he called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the prayer of the Kings,"</Q> not a dozen words of which Mon&s;. Bougainville under&s;tood, or heard him repeat on any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Aotourou informed the Commodore, that an Engli&s;h &s;hip had arrived at Otaheite about eight months before the French touched at that i&s;land. This (&s;ays our author) was the ve&s;&s;el command|ed by Captain Wallace; and he a&s;cribes the knowledge of iron, which was ob&s;erved among the natives, to this vi&s;it of the Engli&s;h, e&s;pe|cially as they call it <HI>Aouri,</HI> which is not very unlike our word <HI>iron.</HI> Our Frenchman likewi&s;e gives a very ungenteel hint, that the poor In|dians were indebted to the Engli&s;h for the ve|nereal di&s;ea&s;e; but the contrary of this is known to be the fact.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his departure from Otaheite, and his di&s;covery of other i&s;lands in the &s;outhern pacific ocean. On the morning of the 16th of April, 1768, he di&s;covered what he thought to
<PB N="285" REF="282">
be three other i&s;lands; but it was afterwards found to be only one, the high lands of which had, at a di&s;tance, given it the appearance of &s;eparate i&s;lands. At a con&s;iderable di&s;tance be|yond this i&s;land, they &s;aw another, which Ao|tourou told them was called <HI>Oumaitia</HI>; that the natives of it were in alliance with the people of Otaheite; that there was a girl on the i&s;land to whom he had a &s;trong attachment; and that if the Commodore would touch there, he would meet with the &s;ame kind of nece&s;&s;aries, and the &s;ame ho&s;pitable treatment, as he had experien|ced among his countrymen.</P>
<P>Our circumnavigator, however, deaf to all the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ive arguments, held on his way, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the i&s;land the &s;ame day. The &s;ucceeding night proving remarkably fair, and the &s;tars appearing with unclouded lu&s;tre, Aotourou pointed out a con&s;tellation in the &s;houlder of Orion, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that the &s;hip's cour&s;e might be directed by it, in con&s;equence of which they would, in two days time, arrive at a fine i&s;land where he had a numerous acquaintance; and it was conjec|tured, from his hints, that he had al&s;o a child there. As Mon&s;. Bougainville per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution not to alter the &s;hip's cour&s;e, Ao|tourou became very unea&s;y, and endeavoured to per&s;uade him to &s;teer for the de&s;ired port, by a&s;&s;uring him, that the i&s;land abounded in hogs, fowls, fruits, and, what he &s;eemed to
<PB N="286" REF="283">
think would be the mo&s;t prevailing argument, fine women, who were abundantly liberal of their favours.</P>
<P>Mortified in a high degree that his rea&s;ons did not operate with the Commodore, he ran to the &s;teerage, and &s;eizing the wheel of the helm, tried to &s;teer for his favourite i&s;le, nor was it without great difficulty on the part of the helm's-man, and equal vexation on that of the poor Indian, that he was prevented from carrying his de&s;ign into execution.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning he climbed to the ma&s;t-head, where he remained &s;everal hours, anxiou&s;ly looking out for the &s;pot which had &s;o much attracted his regard.</P>
<P>On the preceding night he pointed out a great number of &s;tars, and informed Mon&s;. Bougainville of their names in the language of Otaheite; and it was afterwards certainly known, that this i&s;lander was not unacquainted with the pha&s;es of the moon, and that he was learned in tho&s;e progno&s;ticks, which evince an approaching change of the weather. It like|wi&s;e appeared, that his countrymen were not uninformed in this kind of knowledge, &s;o u&s;e|ful to people who&s;e wants or curio&s;ity frequent|ly carry them to &s;ea, where they have no com|pa&s;s to direct their cour&s;e, except their own judgment, and the &s;ight of the coele&s;tial con|&s;tellations.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="284">Mon&s;. Bougainville confe&s;&s;es, that the na|tives of Otaheite are fully convinced that the &s;un and moon are peopled; and he a&s;ks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What Fontenelle taught them the plurality of worlds?"</Q>&mdash;We will an&s;wer him.&mdash;The omnipotent Creator of all worlds, who fills all &s;pace; who&s;e power gave birth, and who&s;e pre&s;ence gives life to nature, and who has pour|ed his bounties, with un&s;paring hand, on every part of his creation.</P>
<P>Our hi&s;torian having acknowledged, that the&s;e i&s;landers are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch great and &s;upe|rior talents, has certainly no right to call, or to deem, them <HI>&s;avages.</HI> Is a man a &s;avage be|cau&s;e he happens to be born in a different part of the world from us; becau&s;e he is unac|quainted with the languages of Europe, and untaught in cu&s;toms, which he could never, from the locality of his &s;ituation, have an op|portunity of learning? The hi&s;torians, and par|ticularly the navigators of this quarter of the globe, are very cen&s;urably fond of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing, by the title of &s;avages, all tho&s;e who are happy enough to be born in milder climates, and to live and die, unin&s;tructed in tho&s;e arts of refinement, and un&s;killed in that ba&s;ene&s;s of in&s;incerity, which are at once the characteri&s;|tick, the boa&s;t, and the di&s;grace of the Chri&s;|tian world.</P>
<P>The weather continued fine till the end of April, at which time the principal pilot on board
<PB N="288" REF="285">
the Boudeu&s;e died of an apoplectic fit. In the beginning of the month of May, three i&s;lands were di&s;covered at the di&s;tance of ten or twelve leagues to the north-we&s;t; but the&s;e were un|known to Aotourou, who imagined that it was Mon&s;. Bougainville's country. The moon &s;hone bright in the night, during which they kept &s;ight of the i&s;lands, and in the morning &s;teered for the large&s;t, the ea&s;tern &s;hore of which they coa&s;ted, and found it about nine miles in length.</P>
<P>The coa&s;ts of this i&s;land are remarkably &s;teep, and, in fact, the whole of it is little el&s;e than an enormous hill, cloathed with trees. Several fires were &s;een on &s;hore, a &s;mall num|ber of hou&s;es covered with reeds, under the &s;hade of cocoa-nut trees, and more than twenty of the natives running ha&s;tily along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The two &s;maller i&s;lands were each about a mile and a half in length, and &s;eparated from the larger one by an arm of the &s;ea; in &s;hape and appearance they are very much like the former.</P>
<P>The Commodore had given directions to &s;teer between the i&s;lands, when a boat, with five Indians in her, was ob&s;erved coming off towards the &s;hip. She advanced very near, but, though every &s;ign of friendly invitation was made, not one of the natives would ven|ture on board. They had no kind of cloath|ing but a bandage round the wai&s;t; and as they
<PB N="289" REF="286">
could not be prevailed on to come up the &s;hip's &s;ide, Aotorou &s;tripped him&s;elf, leaving on nothing more than what they wore, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed them in the language of Otaheite; but they under&s;tood not a word of what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>As they held up &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and other vegetables, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h to barter them for &s;ome trinkets which were &s;hewn them, Mon&s;. Bougainville ordered out one of the &s;hip's boats, with a view to vi&s;it the &s;trangers; but they no &s;ooner learnt his intention, than they rowed off with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and he did not think proper to follow them.</P>
<P>In a little time many other boats advanced towards the &s;hips, &s;ome of them rowed, and others &s;ailing. The&s;e, le&s;s diffident than the former, came clo&s;e under the &s;hip's &s;ide, but none of the i&s;landers would venture on board. They exchanged pieces of an exqui&s;itely fine &s;hell, yams, cocoa-nuts, and a water hen of mo&s;t beautiful plumage, for &s;mall pieces of red &s;tuff; but they did not &s;eem fond of ear|rings, knives, nails, nor iron of any kind; which had been &s;o eagerly coveted by the inha|bitants of Otaheite. One of the&s;e Indians brought a cock with him, but he would not part with it on any terms. They had al&s;o &s;ome pieces of cloth, of the &s;ame kind as that ma|nufactured at Otaheite, but not of &s;o fine a fabrick, and died black, brown and red, but none of the colours were good of their kinds.
<PB N="290" REF="287">
They were likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a kind of wood hardened by fire, lances, mats, and fi&s;h-hooks made of bones.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville conjectures, from the features of the&s;e i&s;landers, that they are not of &s;o amiable a di&s;po&s;ition as the natives of Ota|heite; and he repre&s;ents them as &s;uch dextrous thieves, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t their depredations.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are of the middle &s;ize, and ex|ceedingly alert; they are of a deep brown complexion, but one was &s;een among them who was much fairer than any of the others; they had no beards, &s;o that it was &s;uppo&s;ed they were plucked out by the roots, and their hair, which was univer&s;ally black, &s;tood almo&s;t erect on their heads; their thighs and brea&s;ts were painted with a deep blue.</P>
<P>Their boats are built in a mo&s;t ingenious ta&s;te, and furni&s;hed with out-riggers. The head and &s;tern of the ve&s;&s;el are equally flat with its &s;ides, and over each is a &s;mall deck, in the center of which is a row of wooden pegs, the tops of which are enclo&s;ed in a &s;hell of the pure&s;t white: the &s;ail is formed of matting, and its &s;hape triangular, being extended by means of &s;ticks.</P>
<P>In the&s;e boats the i&s;landers followed the French ve&s;&s;els to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance out to &s;ea, while &s;everal others, from the &s;maller i&s;lands, joined the naval proce&s;&s;ion, and produ|ced
<PB N="291" REF="288">
an effect that was highly agreeable. In one of the&s;e la&s;t mentioned boats was an old wo|man, remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ingular ugline&s;s of her features.</P>
<P>As the weather now fell calm, the Commo|dore gave up, from an apprehen&s;ion of danger, hit project of &s;ailing between the i&s;lands, though the breadth of the channel was more than four miles. They now &s;ailed, therefore, in the open &s;ea, and on the evening of the &s;ame day, the man at the ma&s;t-head had &s;ight of other land, even while they were yet in view, by the aid of a bright moon, of the i&s;lands they had lately left.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 5th it appeared, that the newly di&s;covered land was a mo&s;t beautiful i&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting of alternate mountains and vallies, clothed with the riche&s;t verdure, and finely &s;hadowed by the &s;preading branches of the cocoa-nut, and a variety of other trees. Near the we&s;termo&s;t point of this i&s;land is a ledge of rocks, and the &s;ea breaks with vio|lence on many parts of the coa&s;t, &s;o that it would be difficult to land, except in very few places.</P>
<P>Many boats put off from the i&s;land, and &s;ailed round the &s;hips, though they were then going at the rate of at lea&s;t &s;even knots an hour. The&s;e boats, however, one only ex|cepted, would not venture near the &s;hips; but <HI>that one</HI> went along-&s;ide, and her crew made
<PB N="292" REF="289">
&s;igns for the French to land, which they would have done, but the breakers rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible. At this time the man at the ma&s;t-head ob&s;erved a number of the Indian boats &s;ailing to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>On the following day another i&s;land was &s;een to the we&s;tward of the &s;hip's cour&s;e, in the neighbourhood of which were two &s;maller i&s;lands; but none of the&s;e could be di&s;tinctly beheld, on account of &s;ome thick fogs, which intercepted the view.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mentioned i&s;lands are &s;ituated nearly where Ta&s;man, the Dutch navigator, has placed a number of i&s;lands which he di&s;covered, and to which he gave the names of Heem&s;kirk, Prince William, Pyl&s;taart, Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam. The longitude of the&s;e i&s;lands corre&s;ponds likewi&s;e, very nearly, with tho&s;e which navigators have called Solomon's I&s;les; &s;o that it is mo&s;t probable they are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville conjectures, that the number of boats which were ob&s;erved &s;ailing to the &s;outhward, is a vindication that there are other i&s;lands at no great di&s;tance; and, in|deed, this opinion &s;eems to be well-grounded. o all the&s;e lands the Commodore gave the general name of the <HI>Archipelago of the Navi|gators.</HI></P>
<P>The writer of this work mu&s;t be indulged for giving a hint, which &s;prings from the noble&s;t of motives, the love of his country. It is
<PB N="293" REF="290">
&s;urely well worthy the con&s;ideration of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, whether it might not be pro|per to &s;end a fleet to di&s;cover and &s;ettle &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands.&mdash;Who knows what future benefit might, from &s;uch a circum&s;tance, accrue to the fir&s;t maritime and commercial &s;tate in the uni|ver&s;e?&mdash;The American colonies form the brighte&s;t gem in the Briti&s;h crown. The co|lonies in the &s;outhern pacific ocean might, not improbably, con&s;titute a diadem of &s;till &s;upe|rior lu&s;tre!</P>
<P>On the morning of the 11th another i&s;land was di&s;covered, which received the name of the <HI>Forlorn Hope</HI>; but for what rea&s;on it is im|po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s. At a di&s;tance it had the ap|pearance of two i&s;lands, but this deception was occa&s;ioned by its &s;hape, for it con&s;i&s;ted of two hills, joined by a low land, which could not be &s;een far out at &s;ea.</P>
<P>At this period, and for &s;ome days before and afterwards, the weather was extremely unfa|vourable, the winds being adver&s;e, and the rains and calms alternate. Mon&s;. Bougainville (on this circum&s;tance) ob&s;erves, that in the ocean which has obtained the name of PACI|FIC, the approach to land is generally announ|ced by violent tempe&s;ts, which become &s;till more violent, in proportion as the moon de|crea&s;es. The vicinity of i&s;lands is generally foreboded by thick clouds at the horizon, and &s;qually weather; and the precautions nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="294" REF="291">
to be taken to prevent a ve&s;&s;el's running fowl of &s;hoals, may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance it was im|po&s;&s;ible to proceed with the nece&s;&s;ary degree of caution; for the crew were in want of provi|&s;ions, and water, in particular, grew very &s;carce; &s;o that they were obliged to take ad|vantage of every breeze of wind, both by night and day, and run all hazards, for fear of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, it may be pre&s;umed, that they thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently unhappy; but their di&s;tre&s;&s;es were aggravated by the greater number of the crew of each &s;hip being attack|ed by the &s;curvy, which inflamed their mouths to &s;uch a degree, that they could &s;carcely have &s;wallowed tho&s;e refre&s;hments of which they &s;tood much in need. Salt beef, pork, and dried pul&s;e, con&s;tituted the whole fare of tho&s;e who remained in health; for the &s;ick, how|ever, there were yet &s;ome few articles of fre&s;h provi&s;ions remaining.</P>
<P>At this unfortunate juncture the di&s;ea&s;e, con|&s;equent on an illicit commerce between the &s;exes, made its appearance, attended by all its mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms. Aotourou was &s;o extremely ill of it, that though &s;eeming to de&s;pi&s;e its progre&s;s and its effects, he was ob|liged to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the care of the Sur|geons. Mon&s;. Bougainville's words, on this occa&s;ion, are very remarkable. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In his (Ao|tourou's)
<PB N="295" REF="292">
country, this di&s;ea&s;e is but little minded. Columbus brought it from Ame|rica; here it is in an i&s;le in the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t ocean. Have the Engli&s;h brought it thither? Or ought the phy&s;ician to win, who laid a wager, that if four healthy &s;tout men were &s;hut up with one healthy woman, the venereal complaint would be the con&s;e|quence of their commerce?"</Q></P>
<P>Ungenerous Frenchman! Why this unju&s;ti|fiable attack on the Engli&s;h? At the time Mon&s;. Bougainville wrote the narrative of his voyage, he knew that &s;ome of his crew were infected with the malady in que&s;tion, when they landed at Otaheite; for, in a former part of his volume he has &s;aid, that he did all in his pow|er to prevent their communicating it to the poor i&s;landers. What becomes, too, of his wonder, how a di&s;order &s;hould find its way to a little i&s;land in the pacific ocean, when he knew that his own &s;hip had carried it thither!&mdash;Whether Columbus brought this pe&s;tilence from Ame|rica or not, is, perhaps a que&s;tion not ea&s;ily determined; nor, at this period, is it at all material: but one fact is well known; that the French have plentifully di&s;tributed the conta|gion through Europe, and it is not improbable, that they have likewi&s;e carried it to every other quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is rather of the indelicate kind; but we are nece&s;&s;arily led into it; and may be
<PB N="296" REF="293">
indulged in one remark, that &s;eems to ari&s;e na|turally from the preceding circum&s;tances, and will, we tru&s;t, militate on the &s;ide of virtue.&mdash;Providence, we conceive, wi&s;ely intended one man for the a&s;&s;ociate of one woman, who &s;hould be the companion of his life, the friend of his bo&s;om, the partaker of his joys, the &s;harer of his griefs, who&s;e love for him &s;hould excite all his tenderne&s;s, and repay, with intere&s;t, tho&s;e toils and cares it gave ri&s;e to. Thus paired, thus mutually giving and receiving happine&s;s, the married &s;tate is indeed a heaven on earth. Wedded love, the cha&s;te, the holy, the conju|gal tie, will en&s;ure as much happine&s;s as is to be found in this &s;ublunary world; and tru&s;t, O reader, in the goodne&s;s of God for the fu|ture. To &s;um up this remark, marriages are made in heaven; choo&s;e, ye ladies, with pru|dence choo&s;e, the heart paired with your own; &s;elect ye, generous youths, the amiable fair, who&s;e eyes beam the gentle influence of love, and who&s;e heart feels the &s;olid force of virtue; then be true to each other, and bid defiance to contagion: &s;o &s;hall your days be happy, and your children ble&s;s the parents to whom they owe the fir&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings, health of body, and of mind.</P>
<P>The &s;hips now &s;teered a we&s;terly cour&s;e, and early on the morning of the 22d two i&s;lands were di&s;covered, one of which received the name of Aurora, from the early hour on which
<PB N="297" REF="294">
it was fir&s;t &s;een, and the other that of Whit|&s;untide I&s;le, from the day which gave birth to its being &s;o named.</P>
<P>The track of the ve&s;&s;els was now &s;o directed, as that they might have pa&s;&s;ed between the two i&s;lands, but an unexpected calm prevented this manoeuvre. Proceeding to the northward of the fir&s;t di&s;covered i&s;land, a ri&s;ing land, in a conical form, was ob&s;erved to bear north by we&s;t, which received the name of the Peak of the Etoile.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, mountainous lands, at thirty miles di&s;tance, were &s;een, appearing, as it were, over and beyond the i&s;land of Aurora.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third it was di&s;covered, that the land la&s;t &s;een was a &s;eparate i&s;land; the ap|pearance of which was lofty, its de&s;cent &s;teep, and the whole cloathed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">es. A number of boats were &s;een coa&s;ting the &s;hore, but none of them approached the &s;hips; &s;moke was &s;een i&s;&s;uing from among the woods, but no habita|tion was ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the morning the Commodore di&s;patched three boats, well manned and armed, to take in wood, and to learn the nece&s;&s;ary particulars re&s;pecting the country, while the &s;hips guns were brought to bear on the i&s;land, in order to protect the boats crews from any in&s;ult that might be offered them by the natives.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville him&s;elf went on &s;hore in the afternoon, where he found the good-na|tured
<PB N="298" REF="295">
Indians a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French in carrying to the boats a quantity of wood which had been cut.</P>
<P>The information obtained from the officer commanding the boat's crew was, that on his fir&s;t landing, the natives a&s;&s;embled on the &s;hore, armed with bows and arrows, intimating, by &s;igns, that the &s;trangers mu&s;t retreat. The French officer, however, gave directions for landing, and while his people advanced, the i&s;landers retreated, but with their bows bent, and in an attitude of &s;elf-defence. At length, the crew were ordered to halt, while the Prince of Na&s;&s;au approached the Indians, who no longer retreated when they &s;aw only one per&s;on advancing. The Prince having given them &s;ome remnants of red cloth, their e&s;teem appeared o be at once conciliated.</P>
<P>The commanding officer now &s;tationed him|&s;elf at the entrance of a wood, and &s;ent out a party in &s;earch of refre&s;hments, while another was deputed to cut fire-wood. The natives now came forward, with an appearance of friend&s;hip, and di&s;tributed &s;ome fruit among the &s;eamen, to whom they likewi&s;e gave &s;ome arrows, but refu&s;ed to accept any thing in ex|change. Their numbers were con&s;iderable, and tho&s;e who were not armed with bows and ar|rows had provided them&s;elves with &s;tones, as in&s;truments of defence.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="296">The&s;e people intimated, that they were at war with the natives of a different di&s;trict on the i&s;land, and even while they were hinting this circum&s;tance, an armed party of Indians ap|proached from the we&s;tward, while the former appeared determined not to retreat from their enemies; but the valour of the latter was ren|dered unnece&s;&s;ary to be exerted by the want of pre&s;ent courage in the former.</P>
<P>Matters were in this &s;ituation when Mon&s;. Bougainville landed on the i&s;land, where he re|mained till his boats were laden with the arti|cles he wanted.</P>
<P>This being done, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, by the act of burying at the foot of a tree an in&s;cription, carved on an oak-plank; and then he retreated to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>It was imagined, that this early retreat of the French prevented an attack, which the i&s;land|ers had meditated, as they &s;eemed to be making preparations for what they had not yet in their power to carry into execution; but no &s;ooner had the boats put off, than the i&s;landers ha&s;tened to the beach, and complimented them with a &s;hower of arrows, and a volley of &s;tones; &s;ome of them even plunged into the waves, aiming their fury at the &s;uppo&s;ed invaders, and hurl|ing their vengeance on the in&s;olent &s;trangers. When, at length, one of the &s;eamen had been wounded by a &s;tone, a di&s;charge of mu&s;kets drove the poor i&s;landers to their native woods,
<PB N="300" REF="297">
evidently wounded, from their cries and excla|mations.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville gives the following de&s;|cription of the natives of this i&s;land, which he cal|led the <HI>I&s;le of Lepers,</HI> from ob&s;erving, that many of the inhabitants were afflicted with the lepro|&s;y. Some of them are mulattto's, and others perfect negroes; their hair is woolly, and ge|nerally black, but in &s;ome in&s;tances of a very light brown, approaching to a yellow. Few women were &s;een among them, but tho&s;e few were equally di&s;agreeable with the men, who are repre&s;ented as low in &s;tature, ill-favoured, and di&s;proportionably made.</P>
<P>We will not deny the veracity of our hi&s;to|rian; the works of Nature and of Providence are a&s;toni&s;hing. The God of creation is equally wi&s;e and wonderful in all his works; but we mu&s;t own, that it appears to be a phenomenon, the exi&s;tence of which &s;urpa&s;&s;es the credulity of an Engli&s;h reader, that black men &s;hould have (to u&s;e Mon&s;. Bougainville's own words) hair <Q REND="inline">"of a yellowi&s;h colour."</Q> Of all hi&s;torians, the circumnavigators are fond of dealing in the marvellous. Our Commodore, pre&s;uming that he had vi&s;ited an i&s;land unapproached by any other European Commander, has told us ju&s;t what he plea&s;ed of the natives of that i&s;land, and it is not in our power to contradict him. It would have given weight to the te&s;timony
<PB N="301" REF="298">
of our flippant French hi&s;torian, if he had brought to Paris one of the&s;e curious <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae,</HI> the&s;e yellow-pated negroes.</P>
<P>The ladies of this &s;ingular country carry their children in a bag of cloth, &s;lung at their backs. On the&s;e cloths there are elegant drawings in a fine dye of crim&s;on. The no&s;es of the men are pierced and hung with ornaments; and it is pre&s;umed, that they pluck their beards, as none of them were ob&s;erved to have any. They wear a bracelet on the arm, which had the appearance of ivory, and pieces of tor|toi&s;hells round their necks.</P>
<P>Clubs, &s;tones, bows and arrows form the armour of the&s;e people; the arrows are made of reeds pointed with bone. On the points of the&s;e bones are inverted darts, which prevent the arrow being drawn without tearing the fle&s;h of the wounded per&s;on. The boats of the&s;e i&s;landers bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the Indians of the i&s;le of Navigators; but the&s;e ve&s;&s;els did not approach the &s;hips &s;o near, as to furni&s;h the French with an opportunity of giv|ing a particular de&s;cription of their con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Near the beach on which Mon&s;. Bougainville landed, is a lofty hill, extremely &s;teep, yet cloathed with a &s;uper-abundance of verdure. The vegetable productions of the I&s;le of Le|pers, are far inferior to tho&s;e of Otaheite, ow|ing, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, to the lightne&s;s of the &s;oil, and its want of depth.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="299">Figs, of a &s;pecies not before known, were found in this country; and &s;everal paths were &s;een cut through the woods, and inclo&s;ed by palli&s;adoes about a yard in height. It was conjectured, that the&s;e enclo&s;ures marked the boundaries of the landed property of different per&s;ons. Half a dozen hovels only were &s;een, into which no per&s;on could enter but on his hands and knees; yet the inhabitants were very numerous, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t be very mi&s;erable, from the perpetual wars among the natives of different di&s;tricts on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that the &s;ound of a drum, har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant to the ear, was fre|quently heard in the wood near the top of the above-mentioned hill; and this he imagines to have been a &s;ignal for the Indians to rally their forces; for no &s;ooner had the di&s;charge of the fire-arms di&s;per&s;ed the multitude, than this drum was immediately heard; and when the i&s;landers in enmity with the others appeared, the drum was beat with &s;u&s;pended violence.</P>
<P>Aotourou formed a very contemptible opi|nion of the inhabitants of the I&s;le of Lepers, who&s;e per&s;ons appeared inde&s;cribably odious in his eyes; and of who&s;e language he had not the &s;lighte&s;t idea.</P>
<P>On the 23d more land was di&s;covered, which, on the 25th, was ob&s;erved to enclo&s;e almo&s;t all the horizon, &s;o that the &s;hips were &s;urrounded in one exten&s;ive gulph, while the coa&s;t of the
<PB N="303" REF="300">
newly-di&s;covered country contained many other gulphs, or large inlets, acro&s;s which &s;everal boats were ob&s;erved rowing, from one &s;hore to the other.</P>
<P>The night of the 25th was &s;pent in tacking, and in the morning it was ob&s;erved, that the currents had carried the &s;hips &s;everal miles more to the &s;outh than their reckoning. The number of i&s;les now &s;een was &s;o great, that they could not be counted, nor could the end of the&s;e exten&s;ive countries be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>Steering north-we&s;t by we&s;t, the land had a very beautiful a&s;pect, being diver&s;ified with fine trees, between &s;pots of land that had the ap|pearance of being cultivated. Some parts of the mountains being barren, and &s;potted in dif|ferent places with a red earth, Mon&s;. Bougain|ville conjectures from that circum&s;tance, that they contained &s;ome mineral &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>A great inlet to the we&s;tward having been &s;een on the preceding day, the &s;hips now arrived in it, and &s;aw a number of negro Indians on the &s;outh coa&s;t of it, while others approached the ve&s;&s;els in their boats, but when they came to about the di&s;tance of a mu&s;ket &s;hot, they would advance no nearer, nor could any &s;ign of invitation from the French induce them to alter their re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The land on the north &s;hore is of a moderate height, and cloathed with trees. On this &s;hore many negroes were &s;een, and &s;everal boats put
<PB N="304" REF="301">
off towards the &s;hips; but the&s;e, like the for|mer, refu&s;ed to come to board.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about eight miles from this &s;pot, two i&s;lands were &s;een, which formed the entrance of a fine bay, which the boats were &s;ent to examine, and after they had been gone a few hours, the &s;ound of mu&s;kets were heard, which made the Commodore very unea&s;y. On their return in the evening it appeared, that one of them, in di&s;obedience to the orders of the Commander, had left her con&s;ort, and go|ing near in &s;hore, the Indians di&s;charged two arrows at the crew, which was returned by the mu&s;quetry, and &s;ome larger guns. A pro|jecting point of land prevented the boat being &s;een from the &s;hips; but the ince&s;&s;ant firing induced the Commodore to imagine, that &s;he was engaged with a very large number of the enemies boats, two of which &s;he had certainly encountered.</P>
<P>Preparations were making for di&s;patching the long-boat to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when &s;he was de&s;|cried, coming round the above-mentioned point of land.</P>
<P>The lamentable cries of the poor Indians were now heard in the woods, to which they had fled, from the rage of their enemies, and their drums were ince&s;&s;antly beating.&mdash;We mu&s;t now tran&s;cribe one pa&s;&s;age from Mon&s;. Bou|gainville, becau&s;e it is the <HI>mo&s;t humane,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>the noble&s;t,</HI> in his whole narrative:
<PB N="305" REF="302">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I immediately made &s;ignal to the boat to come on board, and I took my mea&s;ures to prevent our being di&s;honoured for the future, by &s;uch an abu&s;e of the &s;uperiority of our power."</Q></P>
<P>The country la&s;t mentioned con&s;i&s;ted of a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, off which there is to|lerable good anchorage, but at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, that a &s;hip could not cover any boats which &s;hould land, which, as the i&s;lands are cloathed with thick woods, would be the more nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians went naked, and, except a bandage round the wai&s;t, wore the &s;ame kind of ornaments as tho&s;e on the i&s;land of Lepers, whom they re&s;embled in all re&s;pects, except not being quite &s;o black; and the productions of the i&s;land were likewi&s;e the &s;ame.&mdash;The Com|modore very properly declined any attempt to trade with the&s;e people, whom he could not &s;uppo&s;e would barter their effects with tho&s;e, from whom they had received &s;uch e&s;&s;ential injuries.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 27th they again &s;ail|ed, and, in a few hours, had &s;ight of a fine plantation of trees, between which there were regular walks, re&s;embling tho&s;e of an Euro|pean garden. Many of the natives were &s;een near this &s;pot, and as an inlet was ob&s;erved at no &s;mall di&s;tance, the Commodore ordered the
<PB N="306" REF="303">
boats to be hoi&s;ted out; but they found that it was impracticable to land.</P>
<P>The &s;hips now quitted the great clu&s;ter of i&s;lands they had lately vi&s;ited, which re|ceived the general name of <HI>Archipelago of the great Cyclades,</HI> which, it is conjectured, occu|pies no le&s;s than three degrees of latitude, and five of longitude. Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that the&s;e i&s;lands are not the &s;ame that Quiros called <HI>Tierra Au&s;tral del E&s;piritu Santo</HI>; but that Roggewein &s;aw the northern extremity of them, which he denominated <HI>Groningen,</HI> and <HI>Thienhoven.</HI></P>
<P>Our author now recites a very &s;ingular fact. On board the &s;tore-&s;hip was a per&s;on reported to be a woman, which was almo&s;t confirmed by her want of beard, her voice, and her &s;hape. The Commodore going on board the Etoile, enquired into the fact; when the party confe&s;|&s;ed her &s;ex, while floods of tears &s;treamed down her face.</P>
<P>Her &s;tory is extraordinary.&mdash;Born in Bur|gundy, and left an Orphan, &s;he was ruined by the fatal i&s;&s;ue of a law-&s;uit: on which &s;he re|&s;olved to drop the habit of her &s;ex, and &s;erved a gentleman at Paris; but hearing of Mon&s;. Bougainville's intended expedition round the world, &s;he repaired to Rochefort, where, ju&s;t before the &s;hips embarked, &s;he entered into the &s;ervice of Mon&s;. de Commercon, who went out with a view of encrea&s;ing his botanical know|ledge.
<PB N="307" REF="304">
She followed her ma&s;ter, with a&s;toni&s;h|ing courage and re&s;olution, through deep &s;nows, to the hoary tops of the mountains in the &s;treight of Magellan, carrying loads of herbs, plants, arms and provi&s;ions, with un&s;peakable courage, and unwearied toil.</P>
<P>While our adventurers were at Otaheite, the men of that i&s;land flocked round our heroine, and exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"this is a woman!"</Q> would certainly have treated her as &s;uch, but that an officer re&s;cued her from their hands, and or|dered her to be delivered, unviolated on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville ob&s;erves, that this is the fir&s;t woman that ever circumnavigated the globe, and remarks on the &s;ingularity of her &s;ituation, if the &s;hips &s;hould have been wreck|ed on &s;ome de&s;ert i&s;le in the great ocean. The name of this extraordinary woman is Bar&eacute;; and &s;he is as celebrated for her cha&s;tity as her courage.</P>
<P>On the night between the fourth and fifth of June &s;ome breakers were &s;een at half a league's di&s;tance, by the light of the moon. In the morning it appeared to be a low flat &s;andy i&s;le, abounding in birds, which received the name of the <HI>Shoal of Diana.</HI></P>
<P>About this period &s;everal &s;pecies of fruit, and &s;ome pieces of wood, floated by the &s;hip; and a kind of flying fi&s;h was &s;een, larger than the
<PB N="308" REF="305">
common &s;ort, the body of which was black, and the wings red.</P>
<P>A &s;and bank was di&s;covered on the 6th, on which the &s;ea broke violently, and the tops of rocks were &s;een at intermediate &s;paces. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This la&s;t di&s;covery (&s;ays our author) was the voice of God, and we were obedient to it."</Q>&mdash;They therefore &s;pent the night in making &s;hort tacks in that part of the &s;ea with which they were previou&s;ly acquainted.</P>
<P>At this time the &s;alt provi&s;ions on board were become &s;o putrid, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for men, even on the point of &s;tarving, to &s;wal|low them; and therefore the rats were indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;ought after, and eaten in preference to it. The remaining peas would &s;erve only forty days, and the bread two months; &s;o that it became highly nece&s;&s;ary to think of &s;teering to the northward.</P>
<P>On the 10th, before day-break, an agreeable fragrancy impregnated the air, announcing that land was near; and it was accordingly di&s;|covered before &s;un-ri&s;ing. This is de&s;cribed as a mo&s;t delicious country, divided, near the &s;ea coa&s;t, into groves and plains, behind which the land ri&s;es, in the form of an amphitheatre, till the tops of the mountains are lo&s;t in the clouds. The mo&s;t lofty of three chain of mountains was &s;een above &s;eventy miles in-land. The whole country appeared to be rich and fer|tile, but the deplorable &s;ituation to which the
<PB N="309" REF="306">
&s;hip's companies were reduced, would not ad|mit of their &s;taying to take a more accurate &s;urvey of it.</P>
<P>On the 10th a prodigious &s;well from the &s;outh-ea&s;t drove the &s;hips violently towards land, and they were &s;oon within about two miles of it; and the night was pa&s;&s;ed in this dange|rous &s;ituation, taking advantage of every &s;light breeze to clear the &s;hore. A number of boats were now &s;een coa&s;ting the i&s;land, on many parts of which fires were ob&s;erved. A turtle was found here in the belly of a &s;hark.</P>
<P>For &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days there was &s;o thick a fog, that the Boudeu&s;e was obliged to fire frequent guns to keep company with the Etoile, on board of which were a part of their provi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Several &s;hell fi&s;h, called cornets, leaped into the &s;hip in the night, and as it is known of the&s;e fi&s;h, that they are accu&s;tomed to keep at the bottom of the &s;ea, it is evident, that the &s;hips mu&s;t have been in very &s;hallow water.</P>
<P>On the 16th the weather became fine, and on the following day &s;everal i&s;lands were di&s;|covered, one of which was called U&s;hant, from its &s;imilitude to the i&s;land of that name.</P>
<P>By this time our voyagers were reduced to very great extremities. The allowance of bread and pea&s;e was con&s;iderably reduced; and a fear of the con&s;equences that might ari&s;e, obliged the Commodore to forbid the eating of
<PB N="310" REF="307">
leather. There was yet on board a &s;he-goat, which had been brought from Falkland's I&s;lands; &s;he yielded milk daily; but this was in&s;ufficient to &s;ave her life: the &s;tarving crew demanded the victim, and the butcher, who had hitherto been her feeder, wept as he plun|ged the murderous knife in the brea&s;t of his favourite. Soon after this a dog, which had been put on board at the &s;treights of Magellan, fell a &s;acrifice to the dire demands of hunger.</P>
<P>On the 18th not le&s;s than nine or ten i&s;lands were di&s;covered, and on the 20th a &s;till farther number. Our navigators now &s;truggled at once with a variety of inconveniences, occa&s;ioned by foul &s;hips, damaged rigging, crazy ma&s;ts, and tempe&s;tuous weather.</P>
<P>On the 25th high land was di&s;covered, which appeared to terminate in a cape, which they doubled with a degree of tran&s;port that may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed, as it was the point they had wi&s;hed for a &s;ight of, from a certainty that it would enable them to quit for ever the archipelago of i&s;lands, amid&s;t which they had been &s;o long in hourly danger of &s;hipwreck or &s;tarving. This cape was cal|led <HI>Cape Deliverance,</HI> and the name of the <HI>Gulph of the Loui&s;iade,</HI> was given to a bay, of which the Cape forms the ea&s;termo&s;t point.</P>
<P>North of Cape Deliverance about &s;ixty leagues land was di&s;covered, which proved to be two &s;mall i&s;lands; and, two days afterwards,
<PB N="311" REF="308">
an officer was &s;ent to examine &s;everal creeks, in the hope of finding anchorage, while the &s;hips &s;ailed &s;lowly after the boats, ready to join them on the fir&s;t &s;ignal.</P>
<P>The natives now advanced towards the &s;hip in &s;everal boats, carrying from two or three, to upwards of twenty men each.</P>
<P>The&s;e boats had no outriggers, and their crews were as black as the negroes on the coa&s;t of Guinea. Some of them had reddi&s;h hair, and that of all of them was long and curled. They wore white ornaments on their foreheads and necks, and were armed with lances and bows; they kept an almo&s;t continual &s;houting, and &s;eemed rather inclined for war than peace.</P>
<P>When the boats returned on board, the officer reported, that the &s;ea broke on all parts of the coa&s;t, that he had found only one &s;mall river, that the land is every where covered with wood, and that the mountains run down clo&s;e to the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The natives dwell on the mountains, but they have a few huts on the banks of &s;ome of the &s;mall creeks.&mdash;Some of them followed one of the &s;hip's boats, and &s;eemed almo&s;t re&s;olved on an attack; and one of the Indians repeat|edly put him&s;elf in an attitude to have thrown his lance; but he de&s;i&s;ted from his purpo&s;e, and no mi&s;chief was done.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that he was now advanced too far to return; but that he hoped
<PB N="312" REF="309">
to find a pa&s;&s;age, though the weather was &s;o foggy that he could not di&s;cern any object at the di&s;tance of more than two leagues.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 1&s;t of July, the &s;hips were ju&s;t in the &s;tation they had quitted the pre|ceding night, having been impelled forward, and driven back, by the tides.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened but the di&s;|covery of a <HI>Race,</HI> in the middle of a pa&s;&s;age, to which was given the name of <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <HI>Race,</HI> from that of the ma&s;ter of the Boudeu&s;e.</P>
<P>A race is a part of any channel or &s;treight, where there are oppo&s;ing tides, or a rapid and dangerous current; and &s;uch are even &s;ometimes met with in the open &s;eas.</P>
<P>Boats were now &s;ent to find anchorage in a fine bay; and the account of their expedition is as follows.&mdash;That a number of Indian boats, in which were a hundred and fifty of the na|tives, armed with &s;hields, lances, and bows, came from the banks of a rivulet on which their habitations were &s;ituated, and rowed ha&s;|tily towards the French boats, which they &s;ur|rounded, and, with hideous outcries, began the attack with their bows and lances. The French di&s;charged their mu&s;kets; but the na|tives covering them&s;elves with their &s;hields, the fight continued, till a &s;econd firing terrified them &s;o, that they made a ha&s;ty retreat, &s;ome of them &s;wimming on &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="310">Two of their boats were taken, on the &s;tern of which was the figure of a man's head with a long beard, the eyes being mother-of-pearl, the ears tortoi&s;e&s;hell, and the lips were dyed a bright red. Exclu&s;ive of their wea|pons and uten&s;ils, there were found in their boats cocoa-nuts, and &s;everal fruits, the &s;pe|cies of which were not known, the jaw of a man, half broiled, and various other things.</P>
<P>The natives of this coa&s;t are negroes, who&s;e hair curls naturally, and they have a method of colouring it yellow, red, and white. Their cloathing con&s;i&s;ts only of a piece of matting round the wai&s;t. This river received the name of <HI>Warrior's River,</HI> and the whole &s;pot, that of the <HI>I&s;le and Bay of Choi&s;eul.</HI></P>
<P>Two days afterwards a cape was di&s;covered, which was called <HI>Cape L'Averdi,</HI> on which were mountains of an a&s;toni&s;hing height. On the 4th other mountainous land was di&s;covered, from which came off five or &s;ix Indians, and, after lying on their oars &s;ome time, they accep|ted &s;ome trifles which were thrown to them. They now exhibited &s;ome cocoa-nuts, &s;aying, <HI>bouca, bouca, onelle!</HI> and &s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed when the French repeated them. They then intimated, that they would fetch &s;ome cocoa-nuts, but they had &s;carcely left the &s;hip's &s;ide, when one of them di&s;charged an arrow, by which, however, no per&s;on was wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="311">The people were altogether naked, had long ears, bored, and curled &s;hort hair, which &s;ome of them had dyed red, and they had al&s;o white &s;pots on their bodies. Their teeth were red, probably from the chewing of betel.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, which was named <HI>Bouka,</HI> ap|peared to be cultivated, and, from the number of huts that were &s;een, it probably abounds with inhabitants.&mdash;The cocoa-nut, and other trees, di&s;per&s;ed over a beautiful plain, was a &s;ufficient temptation for landing; but the rapidity of the current prevented the po&s;&s;ibility of it.</P>
<P>Two more i&s;lands were &s;een on the 5th, and, as the wood and water were expended, and di&s;ea&s;e reigning aboard, the Commodore re|&s;olved to land here, and, on the following af|ternoon, the &s;hips came to an anchor. The ca&s;ks were &s;ent on &s;hore, and tents erected for the &s;ick, on a commodious &s;pot, where there were four rivulets near together, and where wood for the carpenters and joiners u&s;e, as well as for burning, was very plenty; there were no inhabitants near the place, &s;o that the &s;ick had an opportunity of ranging the woods, fearle&s;s of any attack from the natives, and every thing &s;eemed to con&s;pire to render this &s;pot the mo&s;t eligible imaginable; but there was one great inconvenience, no fruit could be found.</P>
<P>Two huts were di&s;covered on the bank of a rivulet, not far from the encampment, and a
<PB N="315" REF="312">
boat, near which were &s;een the remains of fires, &s;ome calcined &s;hells, and the &s;keletons of &s;ome animals heads, which were taken for tho&s;e of the wild boar. Some fre&s;h bananas were found, which proves, that the natives had but lately left the place.</P>
<P>This i&s;land produces a large, blue cre&s;ted pigeon, which has &s;o plaintive a note, that the &s;eamen mi&s;took it for the cries of men towards the mountains.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now relates an extraordi|nary incident. A &s;eaman being looking for &s;hells, found a plate of lead buried in the &s;and, on which the following letters were very vi&s;ible.
<Q>HOR'D HERE <LB>ICK MAJESTY's</Q>
The mark of the nails with which the lead had been fa&s;tened appeared; and it is plain, that the natives mu&s;t have torn off the plate and broken it.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance gave ri&s;e to a diligent &s;earch, and, at about &s;ix miles from the wa|tering-place, the very &s;pot was found where the Engli&s;h had formed their encampment. Seve|ral trees were &s;een which had been felled, and others which were &s;awn in pieces. A very large and con&s;picuous tree was found, on which the in&s;cription had been nailed; it &s;tood in the mid&s;t of a &s;pacious place, and it appeared, that the plate had been pulled down but a very &s;hort time. There were other trees, to which
<PB N="316" REF="313">
the ends of ropes were fa&s;tened. One of the trees which had been cut down had put forth fre&s;h twigs, apparently of the growth of four months. Mon&s;. Bougainville mentions it as a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that, amid&s;t &s;o ma|ny i&s;lands, he &s;hould happen to land on that &s;o lately vi&s;ited by a rival nation!</P>
<P>Diligent &s;earch was now made for food and refre&s;hments, but almo&s;t in vain; for nothing could be found but a few cabbage-trees, and thatch-palms. No fi&s;h could be catched, and, though a few wild boars were &s;een, not one of them was taken. A &s;mall number of pigeons were indeed &s;hot, the feathers of which were of green and gold.</P>
<P>It will be needle&s;s to mention the other pro|ducts of this i&s;land, as the reader has already had an account of them in the narrative of the Engli&s;h voyages.</P>
<P>No time was now lo&s;t in the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the &s;hips; and an equal divi&s;ion was made of the provi&s;ions, which now began to run ex|tremely &s;hort. A third part of the late allow|ance of pea&s;e was taken off. From the Com|modore to the lowe&s;t per&s;on on board, all fared alike: their &s;ituation, like death, bani&s;h|ed all di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>On the 13th there was an eclip&s;e of the &s;un, which was clearly &s;een, and the proper a&s;trono|mical and nautical remarks made on it. The name of <HI>Port Pra&s;lin</HI> was given to this har|bour,

<P>The Etoile being a light ve&s;&s;el, and there being no &s;tones to balla&s;t her, after the provi&s;i|ons had been taken out, this important bu&s;ine&s;s was nece&s;&s;arily performed with wood; a fa|tiguing and unwhole&s;ome ta&s;k, in &s;o damp a country.</P>
<P>An in&s;ect of a mo&s;t wonderful texture was found on this i&s;land, the body and wings of which appeared &s;o much like the leaf of a tree, as &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it, even on a nice in&s;pection. When the wings are ex|tended, each forms the half of a leaf, and when they are clo&s;ed it is entire. The upper &s;ide of the body is of a brighter hue than the under parts; and it has &s;ix legs, the upper joints of which re&s;emble parts of leaves. This curio&s;ity was pre&s;erved in &s;pirits, and is in the cabinet of the French King.</P>
<P>A &s;ailor who was hauling the fi&s;hing-net, in &s;earch of a &s;carce fi&s;h called the hammer-oy&s;ter, having been bit by a &s;nake, who&s;e bite is poi|&s;onous, was cured in a few hours by a profu&s;e per&s;piration, produced by taking flower-de-luce water and treacle.</P>
<P>Aotourou having remarked the progre&s;s of the cure, intimated, that at Otaheite there were &s;ea-&s;nakes, who&s;e bite is mortal in every in|&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="315">On the 22d repeated &s;hocks of an earth|quake were felt for about two minutes. The &s;ea ro&s;e and fell &s;everal times, &s;o that the con|cu&s;&s;ions were felt on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the extreme bad weather which prevailed, the crews, divided into &s;epa|rate parties, went to the woods every day, in hopes to &s;hoot &s;ome turtle-doves, and gather cabbage-trees and thatch-palms; but it gene|rally happened, that they returned without any &s;ucce&s;s, and wet to the &s;kin. At length, how|ever, they found &s;ome mangle apples, and a kind of pruens; but too late to be of much &s;ervice, as they were now on the point of de|parture. A kind of ivy was &s;ucce&s;sfully appli|ed in the cure of the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>An immen&s;e ca&s;cade was &s;een, falling from numerous rocks into a hundred ba&s;ons of water, and at once &s;haded and adorned by &s;tately trees, &s;ome of which grow even in the re&s;ervoirs, is recommended by Mon&s;. Bougainville as a &s;ub|ject fit to exerci&s;e the fancy of the bolde&s;t painter.&mdash;Why did not his limner make a draw|ing of it?</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the &s;hips companies now became &s;o dreadful, that no more time could be lo&s;t.&mdash;In the afternoon of the 24th a favourable breeze enabled the &s;hips to get out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville remarks, that this coun|try mu&s;t be NEW BRITAIN, and that the great bay mu&s;t be the &s;ame which Dampier calls St.
<PB N="319" REF="316">
George's Bay; but that he had the happine&s;s to land on a part of it where his wants could be &s;upplied by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of i&s;lands having been &s;een in the offing, Mon&s;. Bougainville named them af|ter the officers.&mdash;The field-tents were now cut up, to make trow&s;ers for the &s;eamen, who had been repeatedly clothed during the voyage, to enable them to &s;u&s;tain the inclemencies of &s;o ma|ny different climates. But the la&s;t change of cloathing was now delivered out, and at this period an ounce of bread was deducted from their &s;canty allowance. Their &s;alt provi&s;ions were now &s;o bad, as to be nau&s;eous in a high degree; yet their &s;tarving &s;ituation impelled them to feed on them; but even at this melan|choly period, no one yielded him&s;elf a prey to melancholy. The &s;ailors, influenced by the example of the officers, employed every even|ing in dancing, di&s;pelling, by their mirth, &s;ome of the pangs of hunger.&mdash;Happy Frenchmen! who could be thus mirthful, in the jaws of ap|parent de&s;truction!</P>
<P>New Britain continued in &s;ight till the be|ginning of Augu&s;t, when the &s;hips being nearer the land than they had been before, &s;everal In|dian boats came off, the crews of which were negroes, with woolly heads, which they had covered with white powder. They are tall and active, and wore no other cloaths than leaves round the middle. They held out &s;omething
<PB N="320" REF="317">
that had the appearance of bread, and invited the French to land; but they refu&s;ed to enter the &s;hips, though an attempt was made to con|ciliate their friend&s;hip, by pre&s;ents of &s;ome pieces of &s;tuff. They accepted what was given, and threw a &s;tone from a &s;ling in return; in|&s;tantly retreating, with loud vociferations.</P>
<P>On the following day a larger number a&s;&s;em|bled along &s;ide the Boudeu&s;e; a per&s;on, who had the appearance of authority, carried a red &s;taff, knobbed at each end, in his hand. On approaching the &s;hip, he held his hands over his head for a con&s;iderable time. The hair of the&s;e negroes was painted red; &s;ome of them were adorned with feathers, ear-rings made of the &s;eed of &s;ome herb, or circular plates depending from their necks; others had the no&s;e pierced, and rings ran through it; but the general orna|ment was a bracelet made of the half of a &s;hell. The French were anxious to conciliate the e&s;teem of the&s;e people, but in vain; they ea|gerly gra&s;ped at whatever was given them, but would make no pre&s;ent in return. The roots of a few yams were all that could be obtained from them. Two of their boats being ob&s;erved approaching in the night, a rocket was fired, on which they in&s;tantly rowed off.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t a number of Indian boats attack|ed the Etoile with a volley of &s;tones and ar|rows; but a &s;ingle di&s;charge of the mu&s;que|try
<PB N="321" REF="318">
got rid for ever of the&s;e trouble&s;ome com|panions.</P>
<P>On the 4th of Augu&s;t two i&s;lands were &s;een, which are conjectured to be the &s;ame which Dampier di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of <HI>Matthias</HI> and <HI>Stormy,</HI> or <HI>Squally,</HI> I&s;land. On the 5th a third i&s;land was &s;een, and then the northern point of New Britain, which lies only forty one minutes &s;outh of the land.</P>
<P>On the 7th a flat i&s;land was &s;een, covered with trees, abounding with cocoa nuts, and certainly well inhabited, as appeared from the great number of hou&s;es that were &s;een on the &s;hore. Fi&s;hing-boats in multitudes &s;urround|ed the i&s;land; but the fi&s;hermen took no notice of the &s;hips. This received the name of the <HI>I&s;le of Anchorets.</HI> On the following day a pro|digious number of &s;mall i&s;lands was &s;een, when Mon&s;. Bougainville having e&s;caped the mo&s;t imminent dangers, in the endeavour to dou|ble this chain of i&s;lands, at length happily effected his point, in con&s;equence of a breeze which &s;till fre&s;hened with the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>He now continued to range the coa&s;t till he came within &s;ight of two lofty peaks, to which he gave the name of the two Cyclops. On the 15th two high mountains were di&s;covered on the continent, and two &s;mall i&s;lands near them.</P>
<P>On the 23d two other i&s;lands being di&s;cover|ed, an attempt was made to land, in the hope of obtaining refre&s;hments; but this was found
<PB N="322" REF="319">
impracticable, but by the boats, the Com|manding officer of which reported, that the i&s;lands were totally uninhabited, and that no fruits grew which were fit to be eaten.</P>
<P>This day the &s;hips crews were twice alarmed; the fir&s;t time with a report from aloft, that a range of breakers were &s;een a-head; but this proved to be only the rippling of a &s;trong tide; the &s;econd alarm was from the fore-ca&s;tle, where it was declared, that the bottom of the &s;ea was vi&s;ible under the &s;hip's way. This &s;hoal was perceived by the crew of the Etoile, but was ea&s;ily e&s;caped by both the &s;hips. Mon|&s;ieur Denys, fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of the Boudeu&s;e, died this day of the &s;curvy, to the infinite regret of the whole &s;hip's company. At this time up|wards of forty per&s;ons were ill of the &s;ame di&s;|order, the progre&s;s of which was &s;topped by the plentiful u&s;e of wine and lemonade.</P>
<P>It was now thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tear a &s;ou|therly cour&s;e, in order to get clear of the i&s;lands by which they were &s;urrounded. None of the&s;e i&s;lands appeared to be inhabited, though all of them were cloathed with verdure. During the following night they &s;ailed out of this labyrinth, through a channel about three leagues in breadth. Early in the morning they doubled the &s;outhern|mo&s;t of a number of &s;mall i&s;lands on each &s;ide of this channel, which was denominated the <HI>French Pa&s;&s;age.</HI> On the 26th, in the morning, they pa&s;&s;ed the meridian for the fifth time, and
<PB N="323" REF="320">
early the next day had &s;ight of a &s;mall i&s;land to the &s;outh-ea&s;t; they likewi&s;e &s;aw a &s;teep hill, remarkably high, to which they gave the name of <HI>Big Thomas</HI>; near which are three &s;mall i&s;lands.</P>
<P>They had &s;ight of &s;everal i&s;lands on the 27th and 28th, when Mon&s;. Bougainville gave or|ders for a boat belonging to the Etoile to &s;teer to the &s;outh-we&s;ternmo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;les in &s;earch of anchorage, and to enquire if they produced any thing worthy of notice. The boat having landed on two i&s;lands, which neither produced any fruits, nor appeared to be cultivated, and indicated no &s;igns of being inhabited, the &s;hip was on the point of returning, when an Indian rowed up to the &s;hip's boat, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t &s;ign of fear or a&s;toni&s;hment. The Frenchmen intimated, that they wanted food and liquor; on which he pre&s;ented them with a kind of meal, and &s;ome water; in return for which they gave him a looking-gla&s;s, a hand|kerchief, and &s;ome other trifles, which he re|ceived with indifference, and laughed at the donors. It was conjectured, that this negroe had de&s;erted from one of the adjacent i&s;lands which have been &s;ettled by the Dutch. The number of them were formerly &s;even, but they are now reduced to five by earthquakes. The crew of the Boudeu&s;e took a turtle on this &s;pot of not le&s;s than two hundred weight.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="321">Early in the morning of the 31&s;t our voy|agers had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Ceram, which runs in a parallel ea&s;t and we&s;t, abounds in lofty mountains, and is partly cleared, and partly in its original &s;tate. A great number of fires were &s;een on this i&s;land, which &s;eem to intimate that it is well peopled. Early in the morning, on the fir&s;t of September, our adventurers found them&s;elves at the entrance of a bay, on the banks of which they beheld a number of fires; they &s;oon ob&s;erved two boats under &s;ail, con&s;tructed on the plan of tho&s;e of Malay. A Dutch pendant was now hoi&s;ted, and a gun fired; but the Commodore confe&s;&s;es his error in this procedure, as the people at Ceram are at variance with the Dutch, whom they have al|mo&s;t totally routed from their i&s;land. Mon&s;. Bougainville having been thus un&s;ucce&s;sful, through mi&s;take, returned from the bay, and employed the re&s;t of the day in plying between the i&s;lands <HI>Bonao, Kelang,</HI> and <HI>Manepo.</HI></P>
<P>Some time before midnight, a number of fires attracted their attention to the i&s;land of Boero, where there is a Dutch factory, well provided with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Dutch factory is at the entrance of the Gulph of <HI>Cajeli,</HI> which the French had &s;ight of at day-break. Their joy on this occa&s;ion is not to be expre&s;&s;ed; for at this time not half of the &s;eamen were able to perform any duty; and the &s;curvy had raged
<PB N="325" REF="322">
&s;o violently, that no man on board was perfect|ly clear of it. What few provi&s;ions were on board were ab&s;olutely rotten, and &s;tunk into|lerably.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, their change of &s;itua|tion mu&s;t have been rapturous indeed! From midnight the fragrant breeze had wa&s;ted the aromatic flavour of the plants, which abound in the Moluccas. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The a&s;pect (&s;ays our au|thor) of a pretty large town, &s;ituated in the bottom of a gulph, of &s;hips at anchor there, and cattle rambling through the meadows, cau&s;ed tran&s;ports which I have doubtle&s;s felt, but which I cannot here de&s;cribe."</Q> Our Commodore hoi&s;ted Dutch colours, and fired a gun; but though &s;everal boats were &s;ailing in the bay, none of them came along-&s;ide. In a few hours a periagua, rowed by Indians, ad|vanced towards the &s;hip, and the commanding officer enquired in Dutch who they were; but refu&s;ed to go on board. Mon&s;. Bougainville, however, proceeded under all his &s;ails, and in the afternoon came to an anchor oppo&s;ite the factory.</P>
<P>Two Dutch &s;oldiers, one of whom &s;poke French, now came on board the Boudeu&s;e, demanding the rea&s;on of the Commodore's en|tering that port, when he mu&s;t know that the &s;hips of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company had an exclu&s;ive right to that privilege. He was an&s;wered, in brief, that nece&s;&s;ity was the mo|tive;
<PB N="326" REF="323">
that hunger mu&s;t preclude the force of treaties, and that they would depart as &s;oon as their wants were &s;upplied.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers &s;oon returned with the copy of an order from the Governor of Amboyna, who pre&s;ides over the Re&s;ident at Boero, for|bidding him to admit foreign &s;hips into that port. The Re&s;ident, therefore, entreated Mon&s;. Bougainville to declare, in writing, the cau&s;e of his putting in there; that he might tran&s;mit &s;uch declaration to the Governor of Amboyna, in ju&s;tification of his own conduct.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t being complied with, all dif|ficulties were at an end; the Re&s;ident having performed his duty as a &s;ervant of the Com|pany, was anxious to di&s;charge the &s;uperior duties of humanity. The Commodore and his Officers vi&s;ited him on &s;hore, were received in the mo&s;t friendly manner, and accepted his invitation to &s;upper.</P>
<P>The Re&s;ident and his company beheld with equal plea&s;ure and &s;urprize the effects that hun|ger had on the appetites of the gue&s;ts; nor were they willing to eat them&s;elves, lea&s;t they &s;hould deprive their now too happy vi&s;itants of their full &s;hare of their repa&s;t. Mon&s;. Bou|gainville confe&s;&s;es, that he was &s;upremely hap|py, becau&s;e he had previou&s;ly &s;ent on board what would be an equal fea&s;t to both the &s;hips companies. A contract was now made, that, while the &s;hips &s;hould remain in that harbour,
<PB N="327" REF="324">
veni&s;on &s;hould be daily &s;upplied to the crews, that eighteen oxen, a number of &s;heep and poultry, and a quantity of rice (to &s;upply the place of bread) &s;hould he put on board. The Re&s;ident was likewi&s;e obliging enough to furni&s;h the &s;ick with a quantity of pul&s;e from the Com|pany's garden; but much could not be ob|tained, as it is not generally cultivated on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;ick were now brought on &s;hore, and the majority of the &s;eamen were likewi&s;e indul|ged in walking about for their health and plea|&s;ure. The Commodore hired the &s;laves be|longing to the Company to fill the water ca&s;ks, and to carry the &s;everal nece&s;&s;aries on board.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville and his officers were gra|tified with the plea&s;ure of &s;tag hunting, and he mentions the deer of this country as mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite food. The Dutch originally tran&s;ported them hither. This i&s;land is de&s;cribed as a de|lightful compo&s;ition of woods, hills, plains, and well-watered vallies.</P>
<P>The town of Cajeli, and about fourteen Indian dwellings, formed the Dutch &s;ettlement. A &s;tone fort, which the Dutch had originally erected, was accidentally blown up in the year 1689; &s;ince which time it has no enclo&s;ure but that of pali&s;adoes, with a battery of &s;ix &s;mall cannons. About fifty white people are all that re&s;ide on the i&s;land, of whom a Serjeant and twenty-five men, commanded by the Re|&s;ident,
<PB N="328" REF="325">
form a part. The negroes who re&s;ide in the interior parts of the country &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the cultivation of rice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> and the <HI>Alfourians</HI> are the genuine natives of this country; the former are pro|tected by the Dutch factory, who endeavour to in&s;pire them with the dread of all foreign|ers. The&s;e people are principally kept in awe by the influence of their own Chiefs, for whom the Dutch Re&s;ident profe&s;&s;es a &s;incere regard. Dutch policy, in this, as in all their other &s;ettlements, is the &s;ame; by fomenting a jea|lou&s;y among the Chiefs of their re&s;pective de|pendants, a plot is no &s;ooner formed by one Chief, than it is revealed by another. The na|tives of Boero are not treated as &s;laves by the Dutch; their &s;laves being procured from the i&s;lands of Ceram, or Celebes.</P>
<P>Unlimited freedom and independence appear to reign among the Alfourians, who, re&s;iding on the mountains in the interior parts of the i&s;land &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the produce of their hunting, with fruits and &s;ago. It is pre&s;umed they are not Mahometans, becau&s;e they eat &s;wines fle&s;h. The principal people among the Alfourians pay occa&s;ional vi&s;its to the Dutch Re&s;ident; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they would do as well (&s;ays our author) to &s;tay at home."</Q></P>
<P>The chief products of this i&s;land are various kinds of wood, particularly black and white ebony; and there is a fine plantation of pepper.
<PB N="329" REF="326">
The fruits are pine-apples, citrons, lemons, bitter oranges, &s;haddocks, bananas and cocoa-nuts. Very good barley is likewi&s;e a produce of this country.</P>
<P>Parrots, and a variety of other birds, many of them extremely beautiful, abound in the woods. There is likewi&s;e the wild cat, who&s;e bag under the belly &s;erves for the conveyance of its young. Bats, and &s;erpents of an enor|mous &s;ize, the latter of which are &s;aid to have a &s;wallow capacious enough for the reception of a whole &s;heep. There is a &s;nake too, which, po&s;ting it&s;elf on the trees, darts into the eye of the pa&s;&s;enger who happens to look up, and the bite of this animal is certain death.</P>
<P>Crocodiles of an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ize re&s;ide on the banks of the rivers, devouring &s;uch bea&s;ts as fall in their way; and men are only protected from their fury by carrying torches in their hands. Mon&s;. Bougainville a&s;&s;erts, that the&s;e crocodiles, which roam for prey in the night, have been even known to &s;eize people in their boats.</P>
<P>The name of the Re&s;ident at Buero is Ou|man; he is by birth a Batavian, and is married to a native of Amboyna. He lives in great elegance and &s;plendour, and is attended by no le&s;s than a hundred &s;laves. Mon&s;. Bougain|ville &s;peaks of his politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality in very high terms. After having twice regaled the French Officers in the ceremonious way, he
<PB N="330" REF="327">
bid adieu to all &s;et forms, but his hou&s;e was con&s;tantly open to them, as their own; they al|ways found good viands and liquors, and our author thinks this was no incon&s;iderable degree of civility to per&s;ons who had &s;o lately been on the point of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>The Re&s;ident's hou&s;e is con&s;tructed in the Chine&s;e ta&s;te, in the middle of a garden, which is inter&s;ected by a river: the hou&s;e it&s;elf is a hand&s;ome building, and it is elegantly furni&s;h|ed. Its approach is through an avenue of trees, which are planted down to the &s;ea-&s;ide. The wife and daughter were habited in the Chi|ne&s;e manner, and were no way deficient in the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of good breeding. Their chief employment con&s;i&s;ts in making no&s;egays, and &s;electing flowers proper for di&s;tillation.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of Aotourou, at this fir&s;t fight of an European &s;ettlement, may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. He regarded every object with an inten&s;ene&s;s of curio&s;ity &s;carcely to be &s;atisfied; but he was particularly charmed with the ho&s;pitality of the Dutch. He &s;uppo&s;ed every thing freely given, as he did not &s;ee any thing returned by way of bar|ter. Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ays, that he hehaved &s;en&s;ibly with re&s;pect to the Dutch, to whom he intimated the con&s;equence he was of in his own country, and that his pre&s;ent voyage was mere|ly plea&s;urable with friends whom he e&s;teemed. His con&s;tant practice was to imitate the man|ners
<PB N="131" REF="328">
of the French, both in their vi&s;its, and in their rural amu&s;ements. The knees of this Indian being di&s;torted, he attributed, to that circum&s;tance, his not being taken with the Com|modore on his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the Re&s;ident, and actually de&s;ired &s;ome of the &s;eamen to pre&s;s their weight on his knees, to make them &s;trait.&mdash;This, &s;urely, is no great proof of that good &s;en&s;e which Mon&s;. Bougainville has fre|quently hinted that Aotourou was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of!&mdash;This i&s;lander would frequently enquire if Paris was as grand a place as Boero.</P>
<P>Though the French were only &s;ix days on &s;hore, the healthful air of the place had &s;o far recovered the &s;ick, that, by the help of the refre&s;hments now ready to be put on board, it was very po&s;&s;ible to perfect the cure at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;ick people were conveyed to the &s;hips in the morning of the 7th, and before evening every one was on board, in expectation of the land-breeze, by which, after much difficulty in weighing the anchor, they were enabled to &s;ail about an hour before midnight, and got clear of the gulph of Cajeli before morning.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a recital of the incidents which occurred during his pa&s;|&s;age from Boero to Batavia, in which we &s;hall trace him with all nece&s;&s;ary exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Having coa&s;ted the i&s;land of Boero, the i&s;les of Manipa and Kilang were &s;een on the morn|ing of the 8th, and on the 9th they had &s;ight
<PB N="332" REF="329">
of the i&s;land of Xullabe&s;&s;ic, where the Dutch have a factory, named <HI>Cleverblad,</HI> that is, the Clover-leaf. There is a garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-five men, under the di&s;cipline of a Ser|jeant, and commanded by a per&s;on who holds no higher rank than book-keeper to the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company.</P>
<P>On the 10th the Commodore buried his tay|lor, who fell a &s;acrifice to the &s;curvy, encrea&s;ed, when on the point of cure, by an exce&s;&s;ive drinking of brandy.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 11th they had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Wawoni, and in a few hours &s;aw that of Button, the &s;treights of which they entered on the following day, and ob&s;erved a ve&s;&s;el of a &s;quare form, ranging the &s;hore, and towing a periagua. The French &s;hips were no &s;ooner ob&s;erved by this ve&s;&s;el, than &s;he furled her &s;ail, and concealed her&s;elf behind a &s;mall i&s;land. A French &s;eaman, whom Mon&s;. Bou|gainville had engaged at Boero, &s;aid, that the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion was manned by a &s;et of Indian pirates, who made a practice of taking pri|&s;oners, in order to &s;ell them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the &s;hips &s;ailed by a beau|tiful port on the coa&s;t of Celebes, the view of which land is delightfully variegated by moun|tains, hills, and vallies, and clothed with an exuberance of verdure. In a few hours after|wards the i&s;land of Panga&s;ani was in &s;ight, to the northward of which appeared the highe&s;t
<PB N="323" REF="330">
mountains of Celebes. Panga&s;ani is a flat i&s;land, abounding in trees, and our author con|jectures, that it produces &s;pices; it is, how|ever, certain, that it is well inhabited, from the number of fires that were &s;een on it during the night.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 13th the &s;hips were &s;urrounded with Indian boats, bringing parro|quets, cockatoes, fowls, eggs, and bananas, which the natives &s;old for Dutch money, or ex|changed for knives. The&s;e people were inha|bitants of a con&s;iderable di&s;trict on the moun|tains of Button, oppo&s;ite the place where the &s;hips lay at anchor. On this &s;pot the land is cleared and cultivated, the property of different per&s;ons, being divided by ditches. Some of the fields are enclo&s;ed by hedges, and there are hou&s;es in the&s;e fields; be&s;ides which there are &s;everal villages.</P>
<P>The produce of the country con&s;i&s;ts in po|tatoes, yams, rice, maize, &amp;c. and the bana|nas are deemed as good as in any part of the world. Pine-apples, mangle apples, cocoa-nuts, and citrons, are very plentiful. The natives are of a brown complexion, ordinary features, and of low &s;tature. They profe&s;s the Mahometan faith, and &s;peak the language common in the Molucca i&s;les. They are very hone&s;t, though expert traders.&mdash;They offered Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ome pieces of coar&s;e cotton cloth; but he does not &s;ay whether he dealt
<PB N="334" REF="331">
with them or not; he a&s;ked them for &s;ome nut|megs, which they &s;aid they procured from the i&s;land of Ceram, and in the neighbourhood of Banda; and his remark is, that the Dutch cannot &s;upply them from tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>Our author de&s;cribes the coa&s;t of Panga&s;ani as ri&s;ing in the form of an amphitheatre, from the level of the coa&s;t, which he imagines is frequently overflowed, becau&s;e the dwellings of the natives were ob&s;erved to be &s;ituated on the &s;lope of the hills. The people of Button con&s;ider the inhabitants of Panga&s;ani as pi|rates, and each party is provided again&s;t the attacks of the other by a dagger, which is al|ways worn, &s;tuck in the girdle.</P>
<P>The &s;hips &s;ailed on the morning of the 14th, but coming to an anchor in a few hours after|wards, a number of periaguas &s;urrounded the Boudeu&s;e, one of which hoi&s;ting Dutch co|lours, the re&s;t retreated, that &s;he might come along-&s;ide. It appeared, that in this boat was one of the Chiefs of the country, to whom alone the Dutch permit the di&s;tinction of carry|ing their colours.</P>
<P>Our Commodore &s;ailed again on the 15th, and in the afternoon of that day di&s;patched his barge after a boat which was &s;een in a large bay, with a view to procure a pilot; and the boat readily came, having an Indian on board, who, for thirteen &s;hillings, readily engaged in the pilotage: but his intended &s;ervices were ren|dered
<PB N="335" REF="332">
unnece&s;&s;ary, by the &s;un happening to &s;hine with great lu&s;tre on a &s;pot which directed their pa&s;&s;ing out of the channel.</P>
<P>As oppo&s;ing winds and tides now obliged the &s;hips to come to an anchor, the periaguas came off in great numbers, bringing pieces of cotton, articles of curio&s;ity, and variety of re|fre&s;hments. At the approach of evening the &s;hips got clear of the narrow pa&s;s, and anchor|ed in Boston Bay.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville gives an animated de|&s;cription of the pa&s;&s;age he had ju&s;t cleared. The coa&s;t of Button abounds in enclo&s;ures proper for the catching fi&s;h, while the ri&s;ing grounds are be&s;pread with habitations. The oppo&s;ite &s;hore is perpendicular; and after pa&s;|&s;ing the galley, both &s;ides are &s;teep, hanging in &s;ome places over the channel. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One would think (&s;ays our author) that the god of the &s;ea had opened a pa&s;&s;age here for the &s;welled waters, by a &s;troke of his trident."</Q>&mdash;Might he not as well have &s;aid, that the great God of Nature is equally wi&s;e and wonderful in all his works?&mdash;The coa&s;t of Panga&s;ani has two or three hou&s;es on it, though it is little el&s;e than a &s;olid rock, yet well cloathed with trees.</P>
<P>The Indian pilot above-mentioned gave the be&s;t in&s;tructions in his power, re&s;pecting the mode of pa&s;&s;ing this gut; but he appeared totally unskilled in the European art of navi|gation. Another Indian, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
<PB N="336" REF="333">
pilot's father, went on board the Boudeu&s;e in the morning, and remained till the evening. They both drank plentifully of brandy, but would eat only bananas and chew betel, ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ing to ta&s;te of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 17th, while the &s;hips were under &s;ail, the Indians came off in great numbers, bringing fruit, poultry, and eggs, which they &s;old &s;o rea&s;onably, that even the common &s;eamen could po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of tho&s;e refre&s;hments, in very great abundance, &s;o that both the &s;hips had the appearance of large poulterers &s;hops, and capital fruiterers ware|hou&s;es on a market day.</P>
<P>This morning five of the <HI>Orencaies,</HI> or Chiefs of Button, came off in a boat of the European form, with Dutch colours hoi&s;ted at its poop. The&s;e people were dre&s;&s;ed in jackets and long breeches, with turbans, and each of them had a &s;ilver-headed cane, with the Company's marks on it. They gave Mon&s;. Bougainville a Roe-buck, and received in return, each a quan|tity of &s;ilk &s;tuffs. They paid many compli|ments to the French nation, freely drinking the health of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the king of Button, &s;o freely, indeed, that they were, at length, obliged to be helped down the &s;hip's &s;ide into their boats.</P>
<P>The Commodore enquired of the Orencaies, whether any &s;pices grew on the i&s;land of Button; to which they replied in the negative, and were
<PB N="337" REF="334">
ea&s;ily credited, on account of the weakne&s;s of the Dutch &s;ettlement, which is nothing more than a &s;ew huts, built of the Bamboo cane, and enclo&s;ed with palli&s;adoes. The whole guard, on the part of the company, con&s;i&s;ts only of a Serjeant and three men. The coa&s;t oppo&s;ite Button is enclo&s;ed, cultivated, and well-peopled; nor is the i&s;land it&s;elf le&s;s po|pulous, or le&s;s fruitful.</P>
<P>In the morning the Indian pilot vi&s;ited the Commodore, and informed him, that the &s;outh|ea&s;t wind would blow fre&s;he&s;t exactly at noon. This proved to be &s;trictly true, and was a cir|cum&s;tance &s;o well known to the natives, that all the boats which had &s;urrounded the &s;hip re|tired before the &s;un had gained his meridian altitude.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville, taking advantage of the pilot's advice, got out to &s;ea with a fair wind, &s;teering for the i&s;land of Saleyor, which he di&s;|covered on the 18th.&mdash;On this i&s;land the Dutch have a &s;mall &s;ettlement, the principal Re&s;ident at which is the book-keeper. This day at noon three i&s;lands were di&s;covered, which were called <HI>North I&s;land, South I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>I&s;le of Pa&s;&s;age</HI>; which la&s;t was &s;o denominated from the &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing near it, for the advantage of a &s;afe na|vigation.</P>
<P>By day-light on the 19th they were within about a league of the coa&s;t of Celebes, which, in this part is de&s;cribed as one of the fine&s;t
<PB N="338" REF="335">
countries in the world. Immen&s;e herds of cattle graze on the plains, which are adorned with groves, while the coa&s;t is one continued plantation of the cocoa-nut tree. The plains are in mo&s;t places cultivated and covered with hou&s;es, while the mountains behind them add dignity and ornament to the whole picture.</P>
<P>On this day Mon&s;. Bougainville cha&s;ed a Malayan boat, in the hope of obtaining a pi|lot acquainted with the coa&s;t; but &s;he fled at his approach, nor even brought to, after he had fired &s;everal guns at her. He conjectures, that the Boudeu&s;e was mi&s;taken for a Dutch &s;hip, and ob&s;erves, that the generality of peo|ple on this coa&s;t are pirates, who are always made &s;laves of when they are taken by the Dutch.</P>
<P>The &s;hips having, during the evening, &s;teer|ed between an i&s;land named Tanakeka, and three &s;maller i&s;les, orders were given at mid|night to carry all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible, in order to come within &s;ight of the i&s;les of Alambai.</P>
<P>At midnight, between the 21&s;t and 22d, a boat was ob&s;erved advancing towards the &s;hips; but, though guns were repeatedly fired &s;he bore off, in the apprehen&s;ion, as conjec|tured, that they were Dutch ve&s;&s;els.&mdash;Mon&s;. Bougainville's ob&s;ervation is, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the&s;e peo|ple are more afraid of the Dutch, than of the firing of guns."</Q>&mdash;And, indeed, this ob|&s;ervation &s;eems to be verified by another boat
<PB N="339" REF="336">
being equally &s;tudious to avoid them, a few hours afterwards.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 22d the north coa&s;t of Madura was &s;een from the ma&s;t-head, and a number of fi&s;hing boats were ob&s;erved, &s;ome at anchor, and &s;ome employed in their bu&s;i|ne&s;s.&mdash;On the following morning four &s;hips were &s;een, two of which hoi&s;ted Dutch colours, and one of them was &s;poke with by the Bou|deu&s;e, which proved to be a &s;now from Ma|lacca, bound for Japara.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now coa&s;ted the land of Java, the &s;hore of which is level, but the in|terior country abounds in lofty mountains.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 26th the coa&s;t of Java appeared with the ri&s;ing &s;un. In the af|ternoon the Commodore &s;poke with a Dutch|man, who commanded a boat bound for the i&s;les of Amboina and Ternate, who &s;aid that, according to his reckoning, he was then twen|ty-&s;ix leagues from Batavia.</P>
<P>Having come to an anchor for the night, the &s;hips &s;ailed early in the morning of the 27th, and, on the following night, came to an an|chor, in the fear of having even pa&s;t the port of Batavia; but having &s;ight of the church of that town in the morning, they &s;ailed into, and &s;oon anchored in the road, happy to have, af|ter &s;o many toils, difficulties and dangers, reached a &s;pot which they conceived would &s;oon
<PB N="340" REF="337">
put a period to all their misfortunes, by en&s;uring them a &s;afe arrival in Europe.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to recite &s;uch incidents as happened during the time he was at Batavia, and gives &s;ome particulars re|&s;pecting the Molucca i&s;lands.</P>
<P>We &s;earce know how to treat this &s;ubject with the delicacy with which it ought to be touched, as the readers of the&s;e volumes are already apprized of almo&s;t every intere&s;ting particular re&s;pecting Batavia; but we &s;hall, with the utmo&s;t diligence, &s;elect &s;uch circum|&s;tances as our French hi&s;torian has recorded, which have been either unknown to, or not treated of by the Engli&s;h navigators.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville, for rea&s;ons which would operate on every prudent Commander, re&s;ol|ved to make his &s;tay at Batavia as &s;hort as po&s;|&s;ible; but the want of bi&s;cuit, a &s;ufficient quantity of which was not baked, compelled him to &s;tay longer than he had intended.</P>
<P>A Dutch officer came on board with a writ|ten paper, of which our Frenchman under&s;tood not a word: but the Cock&s;wain having en|quired who their vi&s;itants were, demanded a certificate, written and &s;igned by the command|ing officer. Mon&s;. Bougainville, who had &s;ent an officer on &s;hore to wait on the Governor, declined to give any an&s;wer till his return. This Officer came back late in the evening with an account, that his Excellency was at his
<PB N="341" REF="338">
country-hou&s;e, but that he had been with the <HI>Shebander,</HI> who promi&s;ed to introduce the Com|modore to the Dutch General, on the following day.</P>
<P>The heat of this climate requires, that vi&s;its &s;hould be made early in the morning: Mon&s;. Bougainville therefore &s;et out &s;oon after day-break, and, after waiting on the Shebander, was by him conducted to the Governor General, who was then at one of his country re&s;idences about nine miles from the town.</P>
<P>The behaviour of this Chief of an import|ant di&s;trict was equally &s;incere and obliging: he approved of the conduct of the Re&s;ident at Boero, in his treatment of the French during the hour of their di&s;tre&s;s. He gave permi&s;&s;ion for the &s;ick to be lodged in the ho&s;pital, and i&s;&s;ued the proper orders for their being receiv|ed. The furni&s;hing of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies was left to the Shebander, and when all mat|ters of bu&s;ine&s;s were ended, the Governor a&s;ked the Commodore if he would &s;alute the citadel. To this it was an&s;wered in the affirma|tive, on the condition that the &s;alute &s;hould be properly returned. The&s;e preliminaries being adju&s;ted, Mon&s;. Bougainville went on board his &s;hip, &s;aluted with fifteen guns, and was complimented with the &s;ame number.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the matter &s;eriou&s;ly, is not all this mo&s;t egregious non&s;en&s;e?&mdash;A Frenchman agrees to wa&s;te a cetain quantity of his Ma&s;|ter's
<PB N="342" REF="339">
powder, provided a Dutchman will blow into the air, an equal quantity of the pow|der of their High Mightine&s;&s;es, the States Ge|neral!</P>
<P>The &s;ick people were now &s;ent to the ho&s;pi|tal, twenty-eight in number, mo&s;t of whom were troubled with the bloody flux, and the re&s;t with the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>The officers having taken lodgings in the town, fixed a day for paying a vi&s;it of cere|mony to the Governor, at his country-&s;eat, called Jacatra; after which they vi&s;ited, in form, an officer called <HI>Schout-by-Nacht,</HI> or <HI>Rear Admiral,</HI> who is a member of the Regen|cy, and has a vote in every matter re&s;pecting maritime affairs. This gentleman lives with a degree of &s;plendor that would not di&s;grace a Prince.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville mentions the theatre of Batavia, as an elegant building; but of the performances he was not qualified to judge, from a total ignorance of the language. His curio&s;ity impelled him to take a view of the Chine&s;e comedies, but of the&s;e, al&s;o, he could form no judgment but from &s;ight. Exclu&s;ive of the exhibitions on the regular theatres, he &s;ays, that a kind of pantomine is daily per|formed, on &s;caffolds erected in the Chine&s;e quarter of the city. It is a &s;ingularity of the Chine&s;e comedy, that the characters of men are repre&s;ented by women; nor is it unfrequent
<PB N="343" REF="340">
to &s;ee the actors entertain the &s;pectators with a boxing-match.</P>
<P>Our ingenious voyager repre&s;ents the neigh|bourhood of Batavia as elegant beyond de|&s;cription.&mdash;The neatne&s;s is all Dutch; the magnificence truly Pari&s;ian.&mdash;A clergyman of Batavia, Mr. Mohr, di&s;tingui&s;hed for his im|men&s;e riches, and his exten&s;ive knowledge, has erected, in the garden of one of his country-hou&s;es, one of the mo&s;t &s;uperb ob&s;ervatories in the world, and has furni&s;hed it with great va|riety of in&s;truments of the con&s;truction of Eu|ropean arti&s;ts. Our author ob&s;erves, that he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is doubtle&s;s the riche&s;t of all the children of Urania."</Q></P>
<P>The water of Batavia is of &s;o bad a quality, that the people of fortune import Seltzer water from Holland, for their common drinking, at a mo&s;t enormous expence. The hou&s;es of this city are built only one &s;tory high, on account of the frequent earthquakes, which would be of pernicious con&s;equence to buildings of a lofty con&s;truction.</P>
<P>The riches of the Batavians are marked by the magnificent ta&s;te in which their hou&s;es are furni&s;hed; yet is the city &s;aid to be much infe|rior to what it was &s;ome years ago; and it is certain, that the rent of hou&s;es is not half as much as it was: yet will this place always be rich, through the refined policy of the Dutch, which makes it difficult for any man, after he
<PB N="344" REF="341">
has ama&s;&s;ed a fortune, to tran&s;mit it to Europe: for any money intended to be &s;ent to Holland, mu&s;t pa&s;s through the hands of the Company, who charge eight per cent. for the care of &s;ending it to Europe; exclu&s;ive of which, the current-money of Batavia would &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s of no le&s;s than twenty-eight per cent. even if it could be &s;muggled out of the country.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction of rank is ob&s;erved in the &s;tricte&s;t degree at Batavia. What the French call the <HI>Etiquette</HI> is never di&s;pen&s;ed with. The gradation of rank is as follows, viz. the high Re|gency, the Court of Ju&s;tice, the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, the Company's &s;ervants, the &s;ea officers, and tho&s;e of the military.</P>
<P>There is no appeal from the deci&s;ions of the Court of Ju&s;tice. This court, about twenty years &s;ince, &s;entenced to death the Governor of Ceylon, who had been convicted of mo&s;t infa|mous oppre&s;&s;ions in his government; and he was executed oppo&s;ite the citadel at Batavia.</P>
<P>If any of the re&s;pective &s;overeigns of the i&s;land of Java offend again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed Dutch policy, they are put to death in the mo&s;t inhuman manner. On the&s;e melancholy oc|ca&s;ions, the unhappy &s;ufferers are dre&s;&s;ed in white drawers, and are never beheaded, from a conviction prevalent among them, that ap|pearing in any other dre&s;s, or vi&s;iting the other world without their heads, would be produc|tive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences: nor do the
<PB N="345" REF="342">
Dutch dare to controvert the&s;e opinions, as the immediate con&s;equence of &s;uch a procedure on their part would be a revolt of that of the Ja|vane&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dutch Company have an exclu&s;ive right to a large part of the i&s;land of Java.&mdash;The i&s;land of Madura did formerly belong to them, but the Chief of it revolted from their authority, and the &s;on of this revolting king is at pre&s;ent the Governor of that very i&s;land, of which his father had been the Sovereign.</P>
<P>The Dutch, equally deep in every &s;troke of their politics, have &s;eized the province of Ba|limburan, in con&s;equence of the Sovereign of that di&s;trict having revolted from their autho|rity. It is a&s;&s;erted, that the Engli&s;h erected him a fort, and &s;upplied him with arms and ammunition to combat that &s;lavery, which he thought the more an indignity, becau&s;e it was impelled by the mercantile world. After a war of two years, and after repeated battles, in the la&s;t of which the Javane&s;e Prince and his family were made pri&s;oners, the Dutch be|came final conquerors, and the routed Sove|reign being lodged in the citadel of Batavia, &s;oon fell a &s;acrifice to the grief that preyed on his mind. When Mon&s;. Bougainville arrived at Batavia, it was in agitation to &s;end the &s;on and the other branches of this unhappy family to the Cape of Good Hope, in order that they might &s;pend the remains of a wretched ex|i&s;tence on the i&s;land of Roben. The &s;everal
<PB N="346" REF="343">
Chiefs of the different di&s;tricts of the i&s;land of Java are &s;urrounded with Dutch guards, &s;o that they are Kings only in name. From the&s;e, however, the Dutch receive arrac, rice, &s;ugar, coffee and tin; in return for which they &s;up|ply opium, the &s;ale of which is very profitable, from the great quantities con&s;umed by the Ja|vane&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Commodore now proceeds to a de&s;crip|tion of the commerce of Batavia, and a reci|tal of many particulars re&s;pecting the Molucca i&s;lands; but the&s;e particulars, or others &s;o ex|ceedingly re&s;embling them, being recorded in many volumes of voyages, we &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;earch of &s;omething really new, and re|&s;pecting which our author appears to have been well informed.</P>
<P>Before the crews of the Boudeu&s;e and Etoile had been ten days at Batavia, the di&s;ea&s;es com|mon to that climate began to attack them with all their fury. From a vigorous &s;tate of health the people were, in a few days, reduced to the brink of the grave; nor could the Commo|dore's utmo&s;t diligence enable him to tran&s;act his affairs with a proper degree of di&s;patch, as the illne&s;s of the Shebander him&s;elf prevented the acceleration of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Every officer on board the Boudeu&s;e began to feel the fatal effects of the climate; and, at length, Aotourou felt the direful influence of this pe&s;tiferous clime; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that
<PB N="347" REF="344">
nothing but the readine&s;s with which he took the pre&s;criptions offered him, could have &s;aved him from the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences of the contagion. For a long time after he left Bata|via, he di&s;tingui&s;hed it by the name of <HI>Enoua Mat&egrave;,</HI> the land which kills.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville now proceeds to a de|&s;cription of his leaving Batavia, his touching at the i&s;le of France, and his return to his na|tive country, of which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay but little, as the run from Batavia to Europe is univer&s;ally well known, and has been previou&s;ly de&s;cribed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e volumes.</P>
<P>The &s;hips &s;ailed on the 16th of October, 1768, and cleared the &s;treights of Sunda on the 19th in the afternoon. By this time the crew were all perfectly recovered of the &s;curvy, but a few of them remained ill of the bloody-flux. On the 20th the &s;hips were in &s;ight of the i&s;le of France, and on the 8th of Novem|ber, the Boudeu&s;e anchored in the port of that i&s;land; the Etoile, which had been unavoida|bly left behind, anchoring in the &s;ame port on the following day.</P>
<P>At this place the &s;hips were repaired, and the Commodore left behind him on the i&s;land &s;everal per&s;ons, who de&s;ired to add to the numbers already in that colony.</P>
<P>The Commodore expre&s;&s;es his happine&s;s that he was enabled, after &s;o tedious a voyage, to
<PB N="348" REF="345">
enrich this colony with inhabitants and ne|ce&s;&s;aries; but he laments in the mo&s;t pathetic terms the death of the Chevalier du Bouchage, an En&s;ign on board the King's &s;hip, who&s;e abilities as an officer could be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed only by his virtues and accompli&s;hments as a man.</P>
<P>Our author &s;peaks, in the mo&s;t lavi&s;h terms, of the forges for making iron, which are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on this i&s;land, and he even prefers them to tho&s;e of Europe; how far he is ju&s;tified in this preference, mu&s;t be left to future naviga|tors, or future artificers to determine.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ailed from this place the 12th of December, 1768, leaving the Etoile behind him, to undergo &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary repairs; and this &s;hip did not arrive in France till a month after the Boudeu&s;e. Without encoun|tering any &s;ingular accident, our adventurers had &s;ight of the Cape of Good Hope on the 18th of January, and came to an anchor in Table Bay on the following morning.</P>
<P>Our author very judiciou&s;ly omits a de&s;crip|tion of the Cape, which has been &s;o often and &s;o accurately de&s;cribed by our circumna|vigators, and other voyagers: one circum|&s;tance, however, he fails not to mention, that they killed a quadrupede, named the <HI>Giraffe,</HI> which was &s;eventeen feet in height, and that they took the young one alive, which mea|&s;ured &s;even feet. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"None of the&s;e (&s;ays our author) had been &s;een after that which was
<PB N="349" REF="346">
brought to Rome in the time of Cae&s;ar, and &s;hewn there in the amphitheatre."</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;. Bougainville &s;ailed from the Cape on the 17th, and came to an anchor off the i&s;land of St. Helena on the 4th of February, where he remained till the 6th, and then got under &s;ail in pur&s;uance of his voyage to France.</P>
<P>On the 25th of this month the Commodore joined the Swallow, commanded by Captain Carteret: what pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of this junction the readers of the&s;e volumes are al|ready acquainted with.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened from this time till they had &s;ight of the i&s;le of U&s;hant, when a violent &s;quall of wind had nearly bla&s;ted all the blooming hopes of &s;o fine a voyage. On the 15th the Commodore bore away for St. Maloes, which he entered on the following day, after an ab&s;ence of two years and four months from his native country; during all which time he had buried only &s;even of his crew, a circum&s;tance that will be deemed truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing, when we reflect on the variety of dangers they had encountered; the amazing changes of climate they had experienced; the <HI>hair breadth</HI> perils they had e&s;caped, and the e&s;timated pro|portion of time that any man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to live, at any given age, when in full health, and breathing his native air. To what then &s;hall we a&s;cribe the unexampled &s;ucce&s;s of Mon&s;. Bougainville's circumnavigation, but to the be|nevolent
<PB N="350" REF="347">
interpo&s;ition of that <HI>particular provi|dence,</HI> the exi&s;tence of which hath been lately &s;o boldly, and with &s;uch apparent weight of ar|gument, denied.</P>
<P>Thus have we traced, with the pen of fide|lity, this ingenious hi&s;torian, from the milder climate of France to the frozen regions of the Magellanic &s;treights; and from tho&s;e &s;treights through the inten&s;e burnings of the torrid zone, back again to the benevolent influence of the European &s;un; and abating that vanity pecu|liar to the French, and that nationality, which, if criminal, is a crime ari&s;ing from a noble and prai&s;e-worthy cau&s;e, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that his narrative is as much more philo&s;ophical and ingenious, as it is more pert and flippant than the narratives of our Engli&s;h adventurers! Mon&s;. Bougainville has introduced, in the body of his volume, a narrative of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Spaniards in Rio de la Plata; and al&s;o an account of the mi&s;&s;ions in Paraguay, and the expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits from that province: but as the&s;e recitals &s;eemed to have no imme|diate connection with the Commodore's circum|navigation, we have not interrupted the narra|tive, thinking they would come in with more propriety immediately after the clo&s;e of the voyage.</P>
<P>The river de la Plata takes a &s;outherly cour&s;e to the 34th degree latitude, where it is united with the river Uraguai, making one
<PB N="351" REF="348">
&s;tream, which runs &s;till &s;outherly to the ocean. The Je&s;uits have advanced a fal&s;e principle of geography, and other authors have fell into their errors, by &s;uppo&s;ing the river de la Plata to &s;pring from the lake of Xarag&eacute;s. This lake, which has been the &s;ubject of much enquiry, is now &s;uppo&s;ed to have no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>By order of the courts of Spain and Portu|gal, the Marquis of Valdelirais and Don George Menez&eacute;s, undertook to determine the limits of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e two powers; and accordingly &s;everal Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e officers, tra|ver&s;ed this large di&s;trict of America between the years 1751 and 1755. The Spaniards em|barked on the river Paraguai, and the Portu|gue&s;e proceeded from a &s;ettlement belonging to the Crown of Portugal, called Marago&s;&s;o, &s;ituated on the interior boundaries of the Bra|zils, at about 12 degrees &s;outh latitude, and proceeded up the river Caourou, which, ac|cording to the maps of the Je&s;uits, is de&s;crib|ed as falling into the lake Xarag&eacute;s. But how great was their &s;urprize and di&s;appointment at meeting in the 14th degree of &s;outh latitude, in the river Paraguai, without finding any thing to ju&s;tify the &s;uppo&s;ition of the exi&s;tence of the lake! Hence it was concluded, that the periodical inundations of the river over a con|&s;iderable tract of the adjacent country, having been received in the low grounds, formed a
<PB N="352" REF="349">
body of water, which, by former navigators, was taken for the ideal lake.</P>
<P>The &s;ource of the Paraguai, or Rio de la Plata, is among the mountains, between the two oceans, and between five and &s;ix degrees &s;outh latitude, and it empties it&s;elf into the river of Amazons. The Uraguai ari&s;es in the Cap|tain&s;hip of St. Vincent's, in the Brazils; and the Parana in the mountains to the ea&s;t north|ea&s;t of Rio Janeiro, whence it flows to the we&s;t|ward, and then changes its cour&s;e to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>It appears, from the account of the Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, that Diaz de Solis fir&s;t di&s;covered the Parana in 1515, and called it after him&s;elf, but that in 1526 Seba&s;tian Cabot named it la Plata, or of &s;ilver, on account of the many pieces of &s;ilver which he ob&s;erved in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives of the adjacent country. The fort of E&s;pirutu Santo was erected by Cabot, who had &s;carcely time to &s;ee it completed before it was levelled with the earth.</P>
<P>In 1535, Don Pedro de Mendoza, great Cup|bearer to the Emperor, &s;ailed for the river de la Plata, and founded Buenos Ayres; but this undertaking proved extremely un&s;ucce&s;sful; and after Mendoza's death, the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres, unable to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the depredations of the Indians, and living in perpetual dread of famine, fled for &s;anctuary to A&s;&s;umption, now the capital of Paraguai, which was built by the followers of
<PB N="353" REF="350">
Mendoza, &s;oon became well inhabited, and, of cour&s;e, con&s;iderably enlarged. Don Pedro Artiz de Zarara, Governor of Paraguai, rebuilt Buenos Ayres, upon an improved plan, in the year 1580, and it &s;oon became the principal re&s;ort of &s;hips navigating the South Seas; &s;oon after which it was an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and the place of re&s;idence of the chief magi&s;trate. The &s;ituation of Buenos Ayres is computed to be in 34 deg. 55 min. &s;outh latitude, and 61 deg. 5 min. we&s;t longitude from Paris. The inhabitants, including negroes, do not exceed twenty thou&s;and, notwith&s;tanding which, the town covers a very large &s;pace of ground, ow|ing to the generality of the habitations having no more than a ground floor, with &s;pacious court|yards and exten&s;ive gardens. The public mar|ket is held in a grand &s;quare, the angles of which are formed by the Governor's palace, the town hall, the cathedral and the epi&s;copal palace. There is no harbour at Buenos Ayres, &s;o that &s;hips of any con&s;iderable burden are obliged to &s;ail to Encenada de Baragon, about ten leagues ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t of the town, or el&s;e receive and deliver their freights by means of &s;mall boats.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the Je&s;uit's convent, there is a building, called the hou&s;e for the exerci&s;es of women, where married and unmarried people, without the con&s;ent of their hu&s;bands or friends, &s;eque&s;ter them&s;elves for the &s;pace of twelve
<PB N="354" REF="351">
days, during which time various religious ex|erci&s;es are practiced, almo&s;t without inter|mi&s;&s;ion. There are holy ceremonies appointed for the &s;laves; and &s;uch of the negroes, as pay four reals per annum to the Dominicans, are admitted members of &s;ome religious commu|nity, are intitled to certain holidays, to hear ma&s;s, and a decent interment at the expence of the friars.</P>
<P>This community of negroes acknowledge St. Benedict of Palermo, and the Virgin for their patrons; and on the days dedicated to the&s;e &s;aints they &s;elect two per&s;ons to repre&s;ent the kings of Spain and Portugal, who are fol|lowed by all the negroes of the order, parading through the &s;treets from the ri&s;ing to the &s;itting of the &s;un, &s;inging, dancing, repre&s;enting bat|tles, and repeating religious incantations.</P>
<P>The grounds near Buenos Ayres are extreme|ly fruitful, producing all the real nece&s;&s;aries of life; but it is entirely uncultivated at only three leagues di&s;tance; and in cro&s;&s;ing the plains &s;carce a hovel is to be met with; &s;o that pa&s;|&s;engers are frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;leeping in their carriages, and tho&s;e who go on hor&s;eback are often, for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights, expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the wea|ther. Hor&s;es and black cattle abound in the&s;e plains, and the latter are frequently killed by travellers, who take away &s;ufficient for a few meals, and leave the re&s;t for the birds and
<PB N="355" REF="352">
bea&s;ts of prey. The only furious animals known here are wild dogs and tygers: the for|mer, which are &s;aid to have been originally brought from Europe, are both fierce and nu|merous; and perhaps owing to their food, and the climate &s;eem, as it were, greatly to have altered their &s;pecies; the latter are of the u&s;ual kind, but are not very frequently met with.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres wood is &s;o extremely &s;carce, that very little is to be found that will even &s;erve for fuel, and what is u&s;ed in erecting and repairing hou&s;es, or in refitting ve&s;&s;els, is tran&s;ported from Paraguai.</P>
<P>The Indians inhabiting this part of America are of a copper complexion, &s;eldom exceeding five feet in &s;tature, and of a very forbidding a&s;pect. Their Chief is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a thong of leather tied round his forehead, to which are fa&s;tened &s;everal plates of copper. The arms they u&s;e are bows and arrows, noo&s;es and balls. The&s;e balls are about the circumfe|rence of a two pound cannon ball, and being re|ceived in leathern cups at the end of cords of about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, they throw them when on hor&s;eback, with &s;uch amazing force and dexterity, as to be almo&s;t at a certainty of killing an animal at the di&s;tance of three hun|dred yards.</P>
<P>Some years ago a number of delinquents, e&s;caping the puni&s;hment they were &s;entenced to, retreated to the north of the Maldonadoes,
<PB N="356" REF="353">
where being joined by &s;ome de&s;erters and In|dian women, they have formed a community of de&s;peradoes. They frequently plunder the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, and carry their &s;poils to the boundaries of the Brazils, where they re|ceive, in exchange for them, fire-arms and clothes, from the Pauli&s;ts, another de&s;perate race of robbers, &s;uppo&s;ed to be between &s;ix and &s;even hundred in number, who removed from Brazil farther to the north-we&s;t about the &s;ixteenth century; &s;ince which time they have continually traver&s;ed the adjacent country in parties; and &s;uch travellers as are &s;o unfortu|nate as to meet with them, generally fall victims to their cruelty and rapine.</P>
<P>The governments of Tucuman and Para|guai, with the mi&s;&s;ions of the Je&s;uits, are de|pendent upon the Governor-general of la Plata, who, in all matters relating to the &s;ilver mines of Poto&s;i, is under the jurisdiction of the Vice|roy of Peru. A mint having been lately e&s;|tabli&s;hed at Poto&s;i, the &s;ilver will not in future be brought from thence in the ore, but refined on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Two hundred carts, attended by three hun|dred men, go annually from Buenos Ayres to fetch &s;alt from the lakes adjacent to the &s;ea in forty-three degrees latitude; and the nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining &s;alt is the only motive that indu|ces the Spaniards to travel &s;o far &s;outh of Bue|nos Ayres, where the country exhibits a melan|choly
<PB N="357" REF="354">
pro&s;pect of dreary and uncultivated wilds.</P>
<P>The principal commerce of Buenos Ayres is with Peru and Chili, to which province they &s;end cotton, mules, &s;ome &s;kins, and about four hundred thou&s;and Spani&s;h pounds weight of the Paraguai herb, or South Sea tea every year; great part of this la&s;t article is con&s;umed by the labourers in the Peruvian mines; it being e&s;|teemed a mo&s;t excellent preventative again&s;t the effects of the noxious vapours ari&s;ing from tho&s;e inexhau&s;tible funds of trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding there is but little trade at Buenoes Ayres, it is a place of &s;uch great riches, that the regi&s;ter &s;hips frequently carry away a million of dollars each; and if they were inclined to extend their &s;kin and fur trade, tho&s;e articles alone would, undoubtedly, ac|quire them immen&s;e wealth.</P>
<P>Montevideo was built between forty and fifty years &s;ince, upon a penin&s;ula, to the north of the river, and about ninety miles above its mouth. The town has a bay, affording &s;afe anchorage, but in boi&s;terous weather &s;ome &s;kill mu&s;t be exerted, to keep clear of a chain of hidden rocks off the ea&s;t point of the bay, which are called Punta de las Carretas. The town of Montevideo affords every refre&s;hment; and the air being particularly &s;alubrious, renders it &s;till more inviting to the &s;ons of Neptune, who here find a happy renewal of that health and
<PB N="358" REF="355">
vigour, which, from various cau&s;es, mu&s;t in|evitably be impaired by a long re&s;idence on the &s;tormy element.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits took up their re&s;idence at Para|guay in the year 1580, and in the time of Philip the Third founded their celebrated mi&s;&s;ions, called indifferently by the Europeans Paraguai or Uraguai. The&s;e mi&s;&s;ions are thir|ty-&s;even in number; twenty-nine being on one &s;ide of the river Uraguai, and eight on the op|po&s;ite &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits undertook to convert the natives of this tract of America to the Roman Catholic religion, and in order to encourage them to pur&s;ue this very difficult ta&s;k with a proper de|gree of &s;pirit, they were rendered independent of the Governor's authority, and allowed an annual &s;tipend of &s;ixty thou&s;and pia&s;tres for their nece&s;&s;ary expences. And in order to in|demnify the Crown for this expence, a tax of one pia&s;tre per head was levied upon all the In|dians between the age of eighteen and &s;ixty.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the many and great ob&s;ta|cles which would have di&s;pirited le&s;s determi|ned men, the Je&s;uits, by a &s;teady per&s;everance, the mo&s;t ardent zeal, and a &s;trict attention to the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e &s;avages, at length, civilized their manners, implanted in their minds the principles of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion,
<PB N="359" REF="356">
and made them happy within them|&s;elves and u&s;eful to the community.</P>
<P>In the year 1757 the Spani&s;h monarch hav|ing given up the colonies on the left &s;hore of the river to the Portugue&s;e, in exchange for Santo Sacramento, with a view to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;muggling trade, the Indians of the ceded co|lonies, di&s;gu&s;ted at being driven from their cultivated lands, took up arms again&s;t the Spa|niards. Don Jo&s;eph Andonaighi, Governor-general of the province de la Plata, and Don Joachim de Viana, Governor of Montevideo, marched again&s;t, and entirely defeated them. Soon after this battle the in&s;urrections being quelled, Viana left Buenos Ayres, and was ac|companied as far as the Maldonados by &s;even Indian families, where they &s;ettled, leading a life of exemplary prudence and indu&s;try. The &s;ituation of the&s;e reclaimed people gives an idea of what the poets call the golden age: they knew no di&s;tinction of rank, were neither in|cumbered with riches, nor oppre&s;&s;ed with po|verty; and as all their wants were &s;upplied from the warehou&s;es appointed to receive the produce of the common labour, they had no incitement to u&s;e &s;ini&s;ter and clande&s;tine means to obtain private property.</P>
<P>The country in which the mi&s;&s;ions are &s;itu|ated, reaches about four hundred and fifty miles ea&s;t and we&s;t, and about &s;ix hundred miles north and &s;outh; and the number of the inha|bitants
<PB N="360" REF="357">
is computed to be three hundred thou|&s;and. There are immen&s;e fore&s;ts of all kinds of wood, and exten&s;ive meadows, watered by innumerable &s;mall rivers and brooks, which produce pa&s;ture &s;ufficient for upwards of two millions of cattle.</P>
<P>The country was divided into di&s;tricts, over each of which two Je&s;uits were appointed to pre&s;ide; one of whom acted as Rector, and the other as his Curate. The Indians lived in the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their Rec|tors, who &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed them for mi&s;de|meanours, and annually appointed a number of inferior officers, called Corregidors, to take cognizance of petty offences.</P>
<P>Near the church are two large buildings; one of which was inhabited by a great number of girls, who were in&s;tructed in various occupa|tions. The other building was occupied by young negroe men, who were brought up to various handicraft profe&s;&s;ions; and one depart|ment of this building was appointed to the teaching of mu&s;ic, &s;culpture, architecture, &amp;c. The Rector's hou&s;e &s;tood between the&s;e build|ings, and had communications with each, which he vi&s;ited every day to &s;ee the provi&s;ions ju&s;tly di&s;tributed, and the proper decorum in other re&s;pects &s;trictly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The entire expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits from the Spani&s;h dominions having been re&s;olved upon, Don Francis Buccarelli was appointed to carry
<PB N="361" REF="358">
this de&s;ign into execution; and he accordingly &s;ailed for Buenos Ayres, arrived there in the beginning of 1767, and immediately &s;ent the di&s;patches with which he was charged, to the Governors of Peru and Chili, and the com|manders of Cordoua, Mendoza, Corrientes, Santa-Fe, Salta, Montevideo, and Paraguay. The&s;e di&s;patches were accompanied by letters, &s;trictly enjoining the per&s;ons, to whom the di&s;|patches from the Court were directed, not to open them till an appointed day. As it was a matter of doubt, whether the Indians would tamely &s;ubmit to &s;ee Je&s;uits arre&s;ted in the co|lonies, all the preparations for carrying the King's orders into execution were conducted with the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy. The time for ac|compli&s;hing this grand de&s;ign at length arrived, and the different Governors being previou&s;ly in&s;tructed to open their letters, and to proceed according to their contents, with all imaginable di&s;patch.</P>
<P>The general execution began about two o'clock in the morning, when the Je&s;uits, with equal horror and a&s;toni&s;hment, found their ha|bitations inve&s;ted by the Spani&s;h troops.</P>
<P>They evinced a high degree of philo&s;ophical re&s;ignation and humility in quietly &s;ubmitting to their fate, which they confe&s;&s;ed was not &s;o &s;evere as their crimes de&s;erved.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of September a Cacique belonging to each colony, and all the corregi|dors,
<PB N="362" REF="359">
arrived at Buenos Ayres. The&s;e people were politically detached from their companions by the following &s;tratagem, with a de&s;ign of &s;ecuring them as ho&s;tages, in ca&s;e any re&s;i&s;tance had been made. The Governor-general &s;ent for them, under pretence of communicating the &s;ub&s;tance of the King's letters; and the&s;e deluded people were not informed of the events that had happened, till they received the ac|count from the mouth of the Governor, who gave them a general audience, immediately upon their arrival; when the Governor inform|ed them, that he came to free them from the &s;lavery they had long groaned under, and di|recting them to one of the hou&s;es formerly oc|cupied by the Je&s;uits, they were there pro|perly provided for at the King's expence. The Je&s;uits had e&s;tabli&s;hed other mi&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e abovementioned to the &s;outh of Ura|guay, and were making great progre&s;s &s;outh|ward of Chili, towards the i&s;land of Chilo&eacute;; but the unexpected turn of affairs in Europe utterly de&s;troyed the work, the completion of which had been an object of great attention for a long &s;eries of years.

<HEAD>THE BOOKSELLER'S ADVERTISEMENT. TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the former part of this Collection given an authentic account of the pro|ceedings and di&s;coveries of the Engli&s;h naviga|tors who have lately &s;urrounded the globe; and al&s;o a copious detail of the voyage of a cotempo|rary navigator of another nation, who, jealous of the Engli&s;h de&s;igns, was commi&s;&s;ioned to follow the &s;ame track. That the pre&s;ent undertaking may not want novelty to recommend it, I have procured, at a con&s;iderable expence, the jour|nal of a new voyage to the northern part of the globe; a voyage which his Maje&s;ty, in a particular manner, has thought fit to patronize, and which was equipped with &s;uch care and circum&s;pection, that nothing was found want|ing during the cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P>This voyage I have added by way of Sup|plement, without any additional expence to the &s;ub&s;cribers; and have prefixed to it a brief recapitulation of the many attempts that have been made for the di&s;covery of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;|&s;age to China and Japan, and al&s;o have &s;ub|joined a like &s;ummary of the enterprizes &s;et on foot by government, or undertaken by private adventurers, for di&s;covering a communication with the great pacific ocean by a pa&s;&s;age from the north-we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB REF="363">The&s;e accounts are full of a&s;toni&s;hing events, and wonderful de&s;criptions of uncommon phe|nomena. In them we read of rivers and lakes of ice, bur&s;ting with impri&s;oned vapours; and of rocks, fore&s;ts, beams of hou&s;es and build|ings, &s;plitting with a noi&s;e not le&s;s terrible than the loude&s;t thunder.&mdash;Of brandy, Brine, and even &s;pirits of wine, expo&s;ed to the open air, only for a few hours, freezing into a &s;olid ma&s;s.&mdash;Of mountains of ice frozen in the &s;ea one hundred fathom deep.&mdash;Of &s;now hills that never thaw.&mdash;And of winds that bli&s;ter the fle&s;h, and &s;hrivel the &s;kin like red-hot iron.</P>
<P>In this Supplement the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, dangers, providential deliverances, and un&s;peakable &s;uf|ferings of tho&s;e who have wintered in the dark and dreary regions of the north, are recounted with clearne&s;s and brevity; and, in the &s;mall compa&s;s of a few &s;heets, the contents of many volumes are comprized.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fortunate for commerce, and the inter|cour&s;e of nations, that there is implanted in man's nature a de&s;ire of novelty, which no pre|&s;ent gratification can &s;atisfy; that when he has vi&s;ited one region of the earth, he is &s;till, like Alexander, &s;ighing for another to explore; and that, after having e&s;caped one danger in his progre&s;s, he is no le&s;s eager to encounter others, that may chance to ob&s;truct him in the cour&s;e of his pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>If the hi&s;tory of former hard&s;hips could have deterred men from engaging in new adventures, the Voyage, the particulars of which we are now about to relate, would probably never have been undertaken. The dreary regions that &s;ur|round the poles are &s;o little accu&s;tomed to feel the kindly influences of the enlivening &s;un, and are &s;o de&s;titute of the ordinary productions of the earth in happier climates, that little le&s;s than one whole quarter of the globe is, by its &s;terility, rendered uninhabitable by human beings, and but thinly occupied by a very incon|&s;iderable number of the race of quadrupedes. The many and almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties that mu&s;t therefore be expected in traver&s;ing the&s;e forlorn de&s;arts, where no relief is to be
<PB N="ii" REF="367">
expected, but from the favourable interpo&s;ition of that power, who&s;e merciful providence ex|tends to the remote&s;t corners of the earth, are, upon reflection, enough to cool the ardour of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing, and to &s;tagger the re&s;olu|tion of the mo&s;t intrepid.</P>
<P>In the contention between powers, equally formed by nature to meet an oppo&s;ition, it may be glorious to overcome; but to encounter raging &s;eas, tremendous rocks, and bulwarks of &s;olid ice, and de&s;perately to per&s;i&s;t in attempts to prevail again&s;t &s;uch formidable enemies; as the conflict is hopele&s;s, &s;o the event is certain. The hardie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;kilful navigator, after expo&s;ing him&s;elf and his companions to the mo&s;t perilous dangers, and &s;uffering in propor|tion to his hardine&s;s the mo&s;t complicated di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ubmit to return home with|out &s;ucce&s;s, or peri&s;h by his per&s;everance.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation will be &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified, by a brief recapitulation of the Voyages that have been undertaken, with a view to the di&s;|covery of a North-ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age to China and Japan.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who attempted this di&s;covery was Sir Hugh Willoughby, with three &s;hips, &s;o early as the year 1553, the aera of perilous enterprizes. This gentleman &s;ailed to the la|titude of 75 degrees north, within &s;ight, as it is imagined, of New Greenland, now called Spit&s;bergen; but by a &s;torm was driven back,
<PB N="iii" REF="368">
and obliged to winter in the river Arzena, in Lapland, where he was frozen to death with all his company. He left upon his table a conci&s;e account of all his di&s;coveries, in which he mentions, having &s;ailed within &s;ight of a coun|try in a very high latitude, about which geo|graphers are divided; &s;ome affirming, as has been &s;aid, that it could be no other than New Greenland, afterwards di&s;covered, and named by the Dutch Spit&s;bergen; others, that what he &s;aw was only a fog-bank; and of this latter opinion is Capt. Wood, an able navigator, of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>To Sir Hugh Willoughby &s;ucceeded Capt. Burroughs, afterwards Comptroller of the Na|vy to Queen Elizabeth. This gentleman at|tempted the pa&s;&s;age with better fortune, and returned full of hope, but without &s;ucce&s;s. He pa&s;&s;ed the North cape in 1556, advanced as far north as the 78th degree, di&s;covered the Wygate, or &s;trait that divides Nova Zembla from the country of the Sammoyds, now &s;ub|ject to Ru&s;&s;ia: and having pa&s;&s;ed the ea&s;tern|mo&s;t point of that &s;trait, arrived at an open &s;ea, from whence he returned, having, as he imagined, di&s;covered the pa&s;&s;age &s;o painfully &s;ought, and &s;o ardently de&s;ired. Some affirm, his di&s;coveries extended beyond the 80th de|gree of latitude, to a country altogether de&s;o|late, where the mountains were blue and the valleys &s;now.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="369">Be that as it may, the favourable report of Capt. Burroughs encouraged Queen Elizabeth to fit out two &s;tout ve&s;&s;els to perfect the di&s;|covery. The command of the&s;e &s;hips was given to the Captains Jackman and Pett, who, in 1580, &s;ailed through the &s;ame &s;trait, that had been di&s;covered by Burroughs, and enter|ed the ea&s;tern &s;ea; where the ice poured in &s;o fa&s;t upon them, and the weather became &s;o tempe&s;tuous, that after enduring incredible hard&s;hips, and &s;u&s;taining the mo&s;t dreadful &s;hocks of ice and &s;eas, terrible even in the rela|tion, they were driven back and &s;eparated; and neither Pett nor his &s;hip or crew were ever heard of afterwards.</P>
<P>After this di&s;a&s;ter and di&s;appointment, the de&s;ire of vi&s;iting the frozen &s;eas to the north|ea&s;t began to abate among the Engli&s;h, but was a&s;&s;umed by the Dutch with an ob&s;tinate per|&s;everance, peculiar to that phlegmatic nation. The fir&s;t Dutchman we read of who made the attempt was John Cornelius, of who&s;e voyage, in 1595, we have but a very imperfect account; he was followed however in 1606 by William Barrans, or, as &s;ome write, Barents, an able and experienced &s;eaman and mathematician, who being &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o hazardous a voyage, by the genero&s;ity and pa|tronage of Prince Maurice, proceeded in the &s;ame cour&s;e which had been pointed out to him by the Engli&s;h navigators; but having pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="v" REF="370">
the Wygate, found the like incumbrances, and the like tempe&s;ts which the Engli&s;h had expe|rienced; and not being able to bear up again&s;t them, returned thoroughly convinced, that the wi&s;hed-for pa&s;&s;age was not to be attained in that direction. However, he traver&s;ed the coa&s;t of Nova Zembla, gave names to &s;everal promontories and head-lands, and planned to him&s;elf a new cour&s;e to &s;teer, by which he hoped to accompli&s;h what he had failed in di&s;|covering, by following the &s;teps of tho&s;e who had gone before him.</P>
<P>In 1607, animated rather than di&s;couraged by di&s;appointment, he entered upon his &s;econd voyage, with the &s;pirit of a man fully prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. He had heard, that &s;ome of the whalers, who had now begun to fre|quent the North Seas, had, either by de&s;ign or accident, advanced much farther to the northward than tho&s;e who had been purpo&s;ely fitted out upon di&s;coveries; he therefore deter|mined to &s;teer to the northward of Nova Zem|bla, till he &s;hould arrive at the height of the pole, under which he was per&s;uaded he &s;hould find an open &s;ea; and, by changing his cour&s;e to the &s;outhward, avoid tho&s;e ob&s;tructions which had retarded his pa&s;&s;age to the north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>In this hope he continued till he arrived on the coa&s;t of Nova Zembla, where, before he had reached the 77th degree, he was &s;o rudely attacked by the mountains of ice, that every
<PB N="vi" REF="371">
where a&s;&s;ailed him, that not being able to with|&s;tand their fury, he was driven again&s;t the rocks, and his &s;hip da&s;hed to pieces. Barents and the greate&s;t part of his crew got &s;afe to land, but it was to experience greater mi&s;ery than tho&s;e underwent who peri&s;hed in the attempt. They were obliged to winter in a country, where no living creature be&s;ides them&s;elves appeared to have exi&s;tence; and where, notwith&s;tanding their utmo&s;t efforts to pre&s;erve their bodies from the cold, the fle&s;h peri&s;hed upon the bones of &s;ome of them, and others died of the mo&s;t ex|cruciating pains.</P>
<P>In this extremity, and notwith&s;tanding the angui&s;h they endured, tho&s;e who &s;urvived had &s;till the fortitude and ingenuity to frame a pin|nace from the wreck of their broken &s;hip, in which, at the approach of &s;ummer, they made &s;ail for Lapland; but before they arrived at Colu, their Captain died, and with him the hopes of perfecting his di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It was now the active &s;ea&s;on for naval enter|prizes. Private adventurers began to fit out &s;hips for the North Seas. Innumerable &s;ea ani|mals had been ob&s;erved to ba&s;k upon the ice; the tu&s;ks of who&s;e jaws were found to excel, in whitene&s;s, the fine&s;t ivory, and their carca&s;es to yield plenty of excellent oil. In the infancy of the whale fi&s;hery, the&s;e were pur&s;ued with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s, with which both the Engli&s;h and Dutch endeavour at this day to make the whales
<PB N="vii" REF="372">
their prey, and perhaps with no le&s;s profit. In following the&s;e, many i&s;lands were di&s;covered to which they re&s;orted, and, in cour&s;e of time, the &s;eas that were &s;o formidable to the fir&s;t di&s;|coverers, became frequented at the proper &s;ea|&s;ons by the &s;hips of every nation.</P>
<P>Foreign navigators, however, were more &s;anguine in their notions of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, than of the exi&s;tence of a pa&s;&s;age to the north-ea&s;t; and it was not till many un&s;ucce&s;sful tri|als had been made to di&s;cover the former, that the latter was again attempted. The celebrat|ed Hud&s;on, who di&s;covered the &s;traits that leads to the great we&s;tern bay, which &s;till bears his name; after he had exerted his &s;kill in vain to find a pa&s;&s;age we&s;tward, was per&s;uaded at la&s;t to undertake a voyage in &s;earch of a pa&s;&s;age to the north-ea&s;t. This he performed in 1610, but being di&s;couraged by the mi&s;carriages of others, and the fatal i&s;&s;ue that had attended their ob&s;tinate per&s;everance, on viewing the face of the country, examining the currents, and traver&s;ing an immen&s;e continent of ice, that &s;tretched along the ocean, in a direction from ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t to we&s;t north-we&s;t, he concluded, that no pa&s;&s;age could be practica|ble in that direction, and therefore returned without making any other material di&s;covery.</P>
<P>From this time till the year 1676, the pro&s;e|cution of this di&s;covery was totally neglected by the Engli&s;h; and though the Dutch whalers
<PB N="viii" REF="373">
amu&s;ed the world with wonderful relations of their near approach to the pole, yet little cre|dit was given to their reports till the arrival of one John Wood, who had accompanied Sir John Narborough in his voyage to the South Sea, with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h a new trade with the Chilians, and natives of that va&s;t tract of country, reaching from the Straits of Magel|lan to the confines of Peru.</P>
<P>This able and enterprizing navigator, being him&s;elf an excellent mathematician and geo|grapher, and reading in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions a paper, by which the exi&s;tence of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the ea&s;tern or Indian ocean was plau&s;ibly a&s;&s;erted, and this exactly coinciding with his own notions of the con|&s;truction of the globe, he was induced, by this and other rea&s;ons, to apply to King Charles the Second for a commi&s;&s;ion to pro&s;ecute the di&s;co|very; the accompli&s;hment whereof, it was &s;aid, would add to the glory of his Maje&s;ty's reign, and immen&s;ely to the wealth and pro&s;perity of his kingdoms.</P>
<P>Many about the Court of that needy Prince, hoping to &s;hare in the profits of the voyage, were earne&s;t in prevailing with his Maje&s;ty to forward the de&s;ign, who being him&s;elf fond of novelty, ordered the Speedwell Frigate to be fitted out at his own charge, manned, victu|alled, and provided with every nece&s;&s;ary; while the Duke, his brother, and &s;even other cour|tiers,
<PB N="ix" REF="374">
joined in the purcha&s;e of a Pink of one hun|dred and twenty tons, to accompany her, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey likewi&s;e manned and victualled, and furni&s;h|ed with merchandizes, &s;uch as were thought mar|ketable on the coa&s;ts of Tartary or Japan; the countries they mo&s;t probably would fir&s;t fall in with after their pa&s;&s;age through the North Sea.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hips being in readine&s;s, and commi&s;|&s;ions made out for their Commanders, Captain Wood was appointed to direct the expedition, on board the Speedwell, and Captain Flawes to bear him company on board the Pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>On the 28th of May 1676, they &s;ailed from the Buoy of the Nore, with the wind at &s;outh-we&s;t; and on the 4th of June ca&s;t anchor off Lerwick, in Bra&s;&s;ey Sound, where they conti|nued &s;ix days, to take in water and recruit their &s;tores.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 10th they weighed anchor and continued their voyage; and on the 15th they entered the Polar circle, where the &s;un at that &s;ea&s;on of the year never &s;ets. At noon the Speedwell broke her main-top-&s;ail-yard in the &s;lings, the fir&s;t di&s;a&s;ter that had happened, which, however, was ea&s;ily repaired. The weather now began to grow hazey, a circum|&s;tance that frequently happens in the Polar re|gions, and darkens the air with the ob&s;curity of night.</P>
<P>From this time till June 22, when they fell in with the ice in latitude 75 degrees 59 mi|nutes
<PB N="x" REF="375">
north, nothing material occurred. On that day, at noon, they ob&s;erved a continent of ice &s;tretching to an imperceptible di&s;tance, in a direction from ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t and we&s;t-north-we&s;t. They bore away along the ice till the 28th, when they found it join to the land of Nova Zembla.</P>
<P>On the 29th they &s;tood a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ay to the &s;outh, to get clear of the ice; but unfortunately found them&s;elves embayed in it. At 11 at night the Pro&s;perous bore down upon the Speedwell, crying out, ice upon the weather-bow, on which the Speedwell clapt the helm hard a wea|ther, and veered out the main-&s;ail to ware the &s;hip; but before &s;he could be brought too on the other tack, &s;he &s;truck on a ledge of rocks, and &s;tuck fa&s;t. They fired guns of di&s;tre&s;s, but were not heard, and the fog being &s;o thick, that land could not be di&s;cerned, though clo&s;e to the &s;tern of their &s;hip; no relief was now to be expected, but from Providence and their own endeavours. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, no de|&s;cription can equal the relation of the Captain him&s;elf, who, in the language of the times, has given the following full and pathetic ac|count.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Here, &s;ays he, we lay beating upon the rock in a mo&s;t frightful manner, for the &s;pace of three or four hours, u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible means to &s;ave the &s;hip, but in vain; for it blew &s;o hard, that it was wholly out of our power to
<PB N="xi" REF="376">
carry out an anchor capable to do us any &s;er|vice. At length we &s;aw land clo&s;e under our &s;tern, to the great amazement of us all, which before we could not &s;ee for the foggy weather; &s;o I commanded the men to get out the boats before our ma&s;t came by the board, which was done. I &s;ent the boat&s;wain towards the &s;hore in the pinnace, to &s;ee if there was any po&s;&s;ibi|lity of landing, which I much feared, becau&s;e the &s;ea ran &s;o high. In half an hour he re|turned with this an&s;wer, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to land a man, the &s;now being in high cliffs, the &s;hore was inacce&s;&s;ible. This was bad tid|ings; &s;o then it was high time to think on the &s;afety of our &s;ouls, and we went all together to prayers, to be&s;eech God to have mercy on us, for now nothing but individual ruin appeared before our eyes. After prayers, the weather cleared up a little, and looking over the &s;tern, I &s;aw a &s;mall beach directly with the &s;tern of the &s;hip, where I thought there might be &s;ome chance of getting on &s;hore. I therefore &s;ent off the pinnace a &s;econd time, with &s;ome men in her to be fir&s;t landed, but &s;he dur&s;t not ven|ture to attempt the beach. I then ordered out the long-boat with twenty men to land, who attempted it, and got &s;afe on &s;hore. They in the pinnace &s;eeing that, followed, and land|ed their men likewi&s;e, and both ve&s;&s;els returned to the &s;hip without any accident. The men on
<PB N="xii" REF="377">
&s;hore de&s;ired &s;ome fire-arms and ammuni|tion, for there were many bears in &s;ight. I therefore ordered two barrels of powder, &s;ome &s;mall arms, &s;ome provi&s;ions, with my own papers and money, to be put on board the pinnace; but as &s;he put off from the &s;hip's &s;ide, a &s;ea over&s;et her, &s;o that all was lo&s;t, with the life of one man, and &s;everal others taken up for dead. The pinnace likewi&s;e was da&s;hed to pieces, to our great &s;orrow, as by that di&s;|a&s;ter, one means of e&s;caping from this di&s;mal country, in ca&s;e the Pro&s;perous de&s;erted us was cut off. The long-loat being on board, and the &s;ea running high, the boat&s;wain and &s;ome others would compel me and the Lieutenant to leave the &s;hip, &s;aying it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to live long in that &s;ea, and that they had ra|ther be drowned than I; but de&s;iring me when I came on &s;hore, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to &s;end the boat again for them. Before we got half way to &s;hore the &s;hip over&s;et, &s;o making all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to land the men we had on board, I went off to the &s;hip again, to &s;ave tho&s;e poor men who had been &s;o kind to me before. With great hazard I got to the quarter of the &s;hip, and they came down the ladder into the boat, only one man was left behind for dead, who had before been ca&s;t away in the pinnace; &s;o I re|turned to the &s;hore, though very wet and cold. We then hauled up the boat, and went up the land about a flight &s;hot, where our men were
<PB N="xiii" REF="378">
making a fire and a tent with canva&s;s and oars, which we had &s;aved for that purpo&s;e, in which we all lay that night wet and weary. The next morning the man we left on board having re|covered, got upon the mizzen-ma&s;t, and prayed to be taken on &s;hore, but it blew &s;o hard, and the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that tho' he was a very pret|ty &s;ailor, none would venture to bring him off.</P>
<P>The weather continuing blowing with ex|treme fogs, and with fro&s;t and &s;now, and all the ill-compacted weather that could be ima|gined put together, we built more tents to pre|&s;erve our&s;elves; and the &s;hip breaking in pieces, came all on &s;hore to the &s;ame place where we landed, which &s;erved us for &s;helter and firing. Be&s;ides, there came to us &s;ome hog&s;heads of flour, and brandy in good &s;tore, which was no little comfort in our great extremity. We now lay between hope and de&s;pair, praying for fair weather, that Captain Flawes might find us, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him ever to do while the weather continued foggy; but fearing at the &s;ame time that he might be ca&s;t away as well as we.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing we never were to &s;ee him again, I was re&s;olved to try the utmo&s;t to &s;ave as many as I could in the long-boat. In order thereunto we rai&s;ed her two feet, and laid a deck upon her to keep the &s;ea out as much as po&s;&s;ible; and with this boat, and thirty men, for &s;he would carry no more, I intended to row
<PB N="iv" REF="379">
and &s;ail to Ru&s;&s;ia, but the crew not being &s;ati&s;|fied who &s;hould be the men, began to be very unruly in their mind and behaviour, every one having as much rea&s;on to &s;ave him&s;elf as ano|ther, &s;ome holding con&s;ultation to &s;ave the boat, and all to run the like fortune; but here brandy was our be&s;t friend, for it kept the men always fox'd, &s;o that in all their de&s;igns I could prevent them. Some were in the mind to go by land, but that I knew was impo&s;&s;ible to any man; neither had we provi&s;ions nor ammunition to defend us from the wild bea&s;ts; &s;o the pa&s;|&s;age by land being impracticable, and no pa&s;|&s;age by &s;ea to be attempted till forty men were de&s;troyed, I will leave it to the con&s;ideration of any, whether we were not in a mo&s;t deplorable condition, without the interpo&s;ition of divine providence.</P>
<P>The weather continued &s;till very bad, with fogs, &s;now, rain, and fro&s;t, till the 9th day of our being on &s;hore, which was the 8th day of July, when in the morning it cleared up, and to our great joy one of our people cried out a &s;ail, which proved Captain Flawes; &s;o we &s;et fire to our town, that he might &s;ee where we were, which he pre&s;ently di&s;covered, &s;o came up, and &s;ent his boat to us; but before I went off, I wrote a brief relation of the intention of the voyage, with the accident that had befallen us, and put it into a gla&s;s bottle, and left it in the fortification I had there built; &s;o by twelve
<PB N="xv" REF="380">
o'clock we all got &s;afe on board, but left all on &s;hore that we had &s;aved from the &s;hip; for we much feared it would prove foggy again, and that we &s;hould be driven once more on this mi&s;erable country; a country, for the mo&s;t part, covered perpetually with &s;now, and what is bare being like bogs, on who&s;e &s;urface grows a kind of mo&s;s, bearing a blue and yellow flour, the whole product of the earth in this de&s;olate region. Under the &s;urface, about two feet deep, we came to a firm body of ice, a thing never heard of before; and again&s;t the ice-cliffs, which are as high as either of the fore|lands in Kent, the &s;ea has wa&s;hed underneath, and the arch overhanging, mo&s;t fearful to be|hold, &s;upports mountains of &s;now, which, I believe, hath lain there ever &s;ince the creation."</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far in Captain Wood's own words. He adds, that by the tides &s;etting directly in upon the &s;hore, it may be affirmed with cer|tainty, that there is no pa&s;&s;age to the north|ward. One thing remarkable in his relation, and which &s;eems to contradict the report of former navigators, is, that the &s;ea is there &s;alter than he had yet ta&s;ted it el&s;ewhere, and the cleare&s;t in the world, for that he could &s;ee the &s;hells at the bottom, though the &s;ea was four hundred and eighty feet deep.</P>
<P>Being all embarked on board the Pro&s;perous, on the 9th of July they changed their cour&s;e, and &s;teered for England; and, on the 23d of
<PB N="xvi" REF="381">
Augu&s;t, they arrived &s;afe in the Thames, without any remarkable accident intervening.</P>
<P>After the mi&s;carriage of this voyage, on which the highe&s;t expectations had been formed, the mo&s;t experienced navigators in England &s;eemed to agree, that a pa&s;&s;age by the north, or north-ea&s;t, had no exi&s;tence. They were the more confirmed in this error, for an error it is, by the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by Capt. Wood, for changing his opinion on this matter; for, be|fore he went upon the di&s;covery, he was fully per&s;uaded him&s;elf, and likewi&s;e per&s;uaded ma|ny others, that nothing was more certain. When, however, he fir&s;t &s;aw the ice, he im|agined it was only that which joined to Green|land, and that no &s;olid body of ice extended farther from land than twenty leagues; in this per&s;ua&s;ion he altered his cour&s;e, and coa&s;ted along in the direction in which the ice lay, ex|pecting, at every cape or head-land of ice, af|ter running a certain di&s;tance, to find an open|ing into the Polar ocean; but after running two or three gla&s;&s;es to the northward in one bay, he found him&s;elf entangled in another; and thus it continued till his &s;hip was wrecked. By this experiment, he found the opinion of Barents confuted, namely, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that by &s;tearing the middle cour&s;e between Spit&s;bergen and Nova Zembla, an open &s;ea might be at|tained, in which a &s;hip might &s;afely &s;ail as far as the pole."</Q> From his own experience,
<PB N="xvii" REF="382">
he therefore pronounced, that all the Dutch relations were forgeries which a&s;&s;erted, that any man had ever bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> under the pole; verily be|lieving, that if there be no land to the north|ward of 80 degrees, that the &s;ea is there frozen, and always continues &s;o; and grounding his opinion upon this remark, that if the body of ice which he &s;aw were to be conveyed ten de|grees more to the &s;outhward, many centuries of years would elap&s;e before it would be melted.</P>
<P>To this po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, however, may be oppo&s;ed, the te&s;timony of many credible per|&s;ons, &s;ome of whom have them&s;elves &s;ailed be|yond the 80th degree of north latitude, and others, upon evidence, who&s;e veracity there is no rea&s;onable cau&s;e to bring in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Among the latter, the te&s;timony of Mr. Jo&s;eph Moxon, member of the Royal Society of London, mu&s;t have con&s;iderable weight. In a paper which this gentleman cau&s;ed to be printed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, is this remarkable relation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being about twenty years ago in Am&s;ter|dam, I went into a public hou&s;e to drink a cup of beer for my thir&s;t; and &s;itting by the public fire, among &s;everal people, there happened a &s;eaman to come in, who &s;eeing a friend of his there, who he knew went the Greenland voyage, wondered to &s;ee him, becau&s;e it was not yet time for the Green|land
<PB N="xviii" REF="383">
fleet to come home, and a&s;ked him, what accident had brought him home &s;o &s;oon? His friend (who was the &s;teer&s;man) an&s;wered, that their &s;hips went not out to fi&s;h, but only to take in the lading of the fleet, to bring it to an early market. But, &s;aid he, before the fleet had caught fi&s;h enough to lade us, we, by order of the Greenland Company, &s;ailed unto the north pole, and came back again. Whereupon, &s;ays Moxon, I entered into di&s;cour&s;e with him, and &s;eemed to que&s;tion the truth of what he &s;aid; but he did a&s;&s;ure me it was true, and that the &s;hip was then in Am&s;ter|dam, and many of the &s;eamen belonging to her ready to ju&s;tify the truth of it; and told me, moreover, that they had &s;ailed two degrees beyond the pole. I a&s;ked him, if they found no land or i&s;lands about the pole? He an&s;wered, no; there was a free and open &s;ea. I a&s;ked him, if they did not meet with a great deal of ice? He told me, no; they &s;aw no ice about the pole. I a&s;ked him, what weather they had there? He told me, fine warm weather, &s;uch as was at Am|&s;terdam in the &s;ummer-time, and as hot. I &s;hould have a&s;ked him more que&s;tions, but that he was engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with his friend, and I could not, in mode&s;ty, inter|rupt them longer. But I believe the &s;teer&s;|man &s;poke truth; for he &s;eemed a plain, ho|ne&s;t,
<PB N="xix" REF="384">
and unaffectatious per&s;on, and one who could have no de&s;ign upon me."</Q></P>
<P>To authenticate this relation it has been ob&s;erved, that under the poles, the &s;un in June being 23 degrees high, and having little or no depre&s;&s;ion towards the horizon, always, as it were, &s;wimming about in the &s;ame eleva|tion, might invigorate that part of the hemi&s;|phere with more heat than he does our climate; when he is, in the winter, no more than 15 degrees at the highe&s;t, and but eight hours above the horizon; in which &s;pace the earth has time to cool, and to lo&s;e, in the night, the in|fluences of heat which it receives in the day.</P>
<P>Another report upon like evidence was made to King Charles the Second, by Capt. Goul|den, who being a Greenland whaler him&s;elf, &s;poke with two Hollanders in the North Seas, that had &s;ailed within one degree of the pole, where they met with no ice, but a hollow grown &s;ea, like that in the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>A &s;till more credible te&s;timony is, that about the year 1670, application being made to the States General for a charter to incorpo|rate a company of merchants to trade to Japan and China, by a new pa&s;&s;age to the north ea&s;t; the then Ea&s;t India Company oppo&s;ed it, and that &s;o effectually, that their High Mightine&s;&s;es refu&s;ed to grant what the merchants reque&s;ted.</P>
<P>At that time it was talked of in Holland, as a matter of no difficulty to &s;ail to Japan by the
<PB N="xx" REF="385">
way of Greenland; and it was publickly a&s;|&s;erted and believed, that &s;everal Dutch &s;hips had actually done it. The merchants being re|quired to verify this fact, de&s;ired that the jour|nals of the Greenland &s;quadron of 1655 might be produced; in &s;even of which there was notice taken of a &s;hip which that year had &s;ailed as high as the latitude of 89; and three journals of that &s;hip being produced, they all agreed, as to one ob&s;ervation taken by the ma&s;ter, Augu&s;t 1, 1655, in 88 degrees 56 mi|nutes north.</P>
<P>But a proof inconte&s;tible, is the te&s;timony of Captain Hud&s;on, who &s;ailed in 1607 to the la|titude of 81 degrees 30 minutes north, where he arrived on the 16th of July, the weather be|ing then pretty warm.</P>
<P>Add to all the&s;e, that the Dutch, who were employed in 1670, in endeavouring to find a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, advanced within a very few degrees of that open &s;ea, which is now com|monly navigated by the Ru&s;&s;ians, and which would infallibly have brought them to the coa&s;ts of China and Japan, had they per&s;evered in the cour&s;e they were pur&s;uing.</P>
<P>It does not appear, however, from any au|thentic accounts that we can collect, that any voyage, profe&s;&s;edly for the di&s;covery of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, has been undertaken by either public or private adventurers in England, &s;ince that of Capt. Wood in the year 1670, till the
<PB N="xxi" REF="386">
pre&s;ent year: and it is more than probable, that if the Ru&s;&s;ian di&s;coveries on the north of A&s;ia had never taken place, the thoughts of finding a practicable pa&s;&s;age from Europe in that direction, would have lain dormant for ever.</P>
<P>But the va&s;t and enterprizing genius of Peter the Great, in forcing his &s;ubjects out of that ob&s;curity in which they had long been involved, has opened to the maritime powers new &s;ources of commerce, and furni&s;hed fre&s;h motives for new enterprizes. From a people unacquainted with a ve&s;&s;el bigger than a bark, and who knew no navigation but that of their own rivers, that wonderful Prince not only taught them the u&s;e of &s;hips, but in&s;tructed them in the true prin|ciples of building and equipping them. Nay, he did more; for after making him&s;elf known and admired throughout Europe, he conceived the de&s;ign of opening a communication with the remote&s;t parts of the globe, and di&s;covering to the world new countries which no European nation had ever yet explored.</P>
<P>With this de&s;ign, he planned one of the bolde&s;t enterprizes that ever entered into the heart of man; and though he did not &s;urvive to &s;ee it executed, the glory of the atchievement is wholly his.</P>
<P>The country of Kam&s;chatka was as much unknown to his predece&s;&s;ors, as it was to the re&s;t of the civilized nations of the earth; yet
<PB N="xxii" REF="387">
he formed the de&s;ign of making that &s;avage country the centre of the mo&s;t glorious at|chievements.</P>
<P>It was in the la&s;t year of this great Monarch's life, that he commi&s;&s;ioned Capt. Behring to traver&s;e the wild, and then almo&s;t de&s;olate, country of Siberia, and to continue his route to Kamt&s;chatka, where he was to build one or more ve&s;&s;els, in order to di&s;cover whether the country towards the north, of which at that time they had no di&s;tinct knowledge, was a part of America, or not; and if it was, his in&s;truc|tions authorized him to endeavour, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to &s;eek and cultivate the ac|quaintance of &s;ome European people, and to learn from them the &s;tate of the country at which he &s;hould arrive. If he failed in this, he was to make &s;uch di&s;coveries as circum&s;tances &s;hould pre&s;ent, and commit to writing the re|&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations for the u&s;e of his Im|perial ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>To enter minutely into the particulars of Capt. Behring's journey and voyage, would car|ry us beyond the limits pre&s;cribed for this In|troduction: let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that after &s;ur|mounting incredible difficulties, and &s;uffering hard&s;hips which none but a Ru&s;&s;ian could have &s;urvived, he executed his commi&s;&s;ion &s;ucce&s;s|fully, and returned to Peter&s;burg in &s;afety, after an ab&s;ence of five years, in which time, be&s;ides his voyage by &s;ea, he had travelled, in going
<PB N="xxiii" REF="388">
and returning, eighteen thou&s;and miles by land.</P>
<P>It is from the &s;econd enterprizes of this a&s;to|ni&s;hing man, and from the &s;ub&s;equent voyages of the Ru&s;&s;ians, that we are able to a&s;certain the exi&s;tence of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age; and it is from thence, and from the late voyage of Capt. Phipps, that, we think, we may fairly infer the practicability of it.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time about the year 1740, that Capt. Behring embarked on his &s;econd voyage from Kamt&s;chatka, of which all that we know is, that he &s;ailed &s;outhward to the i&s;les of Japan, and from thence ea&s;tward about 80 leagues. At that di&s;tance from Japan he di&s;|covered land, which he coa&s;ted north-we&s;t, &s;till approaching to the north-ea&s;t cape of A&s;ia, which he doubled, and named Cape Shelvg|hen&s;ki, not daring to land till he arrived at the mouth of a great river, where, &s;ending his boats with mo&s;t of his crew on &s;hore, they never more returned, being either killed or detained by the inhabitants, which made his di&s;covery incompleat; for not having men &s;ufficient left to navigate the &s;hip, &s;he went on &s;hore on an uninhabited i&s;land, where the Captain unfortu|nately died.</P>
<P>From this voyage, however, we learn that the &s;ea, from the north-ea&s;t cape of Kamt|&s;chatka, is open to the i&s;les of Japan, and from a &s;ub&s;equent account of Ru&s;&s;ian voyages, pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="xxiv" REF="389">
in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, from a paper communicated by the celebrated Euler, it appears, that they pa&s;&s;ed along in &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els, coa&s;ting between Nova Zembla and the continent, at divers times in the middle of &s;ummer, when tho&s;e &s;eas were open. The fir&s;t expedition was from the river Oby, latitude 66 degrees north, longitude 65 degrees ea&s;t from London, and at the approach of winter, the ve&s;&s;els &s;heltered them&s;elves by going up the Ja|ni&s;ka, the mouth of which is marked in our maps in latitude 70 degrees north, and in lon|gitude 82 degrees ea&s;t; from whence the next &s;ummer they proceeded to the mouth of the Lena in latitude 72 degrees north, and in lon|gitude 115 degrees, into which they again re|tired for the winter &s;ea&s;on. The third expedi|tion was from the mouth of this river, to the farthe&s;t north cape of A&s;ia, in 72 degrees of north latitude, and in 172 degrees of ea&s;t lon|gitude from London. Thus the Ru&s;&s;ians hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed between the continent and Nova Zembla, and &s;ailed as far as the ea&s;ternmo&s;t north cape, and the Engli&s;h and Dutch having repeatedly &s;ailed through the &s;traits that divide Nova Zembla from the continent, nothing can be a plainer demon&s;tration of the reality of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, than the &s;um of the voyages here enumerated, when added together. The Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;ail to Wygatz, or the &s;trait of Nova Zembla; the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ail from
<PB N="xxv" REF="390">
Wygatz to the north cape of A&s;ia; and Beh|ring from the north cape to Japan. This is an in|controvertible demon&s;tration; yet it is obvious, that this cour&s;e can never be practicable to &s;hips employed in trade. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by taking the advantage of an open &s;ea and mild wea|ther, in three years time accompli&s;hed but part of a voyage, which, by the Cape of Good Hope, may be made in le&s;s than one. Who therefore would run the hazard of &s;o de&s;perate a pa&s;&s;age, for the &s;ake of reaping imaginary ad|vantages by an intercour&s;e with &s;avages, who, for aught we know, have nothing to exchange for European commodities, but the &s;kins of bears, or the bones of mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>But tho' the pa&s;&s;age to the northern countries of the ea&s;t was known to be impracticable to European navigators in this direction, it was worthy the greatne&s;s of a maritime people, to endeavour to determine the po&s;&s;ibility of at|taining the &s;ame end by another cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The mi&s;carriage and death of Barentz, and the &s;hipwreck of Capt. Wood, had left the que&s;tion undetermined, whether the regions ad|joining to the pole are land or water, frozen or open &s;ea. The advantages from this di&s;covery, be&s;ides the glory re&s;ulting from it, had the de|ci&s;ion terminated in favour of navigation, would have been immen&s;ely great. To have opened a new chanel of commerce at a time when our trade is langui&s;hing, would have revived the
<PB N="xxvi" REF="391">
drooping hopes of our manufacturers, and re|tained at home the numerous emigrants, who, for want of employment in their own country, are &s;eeking new habitations, and new means of living in remote &s;ettlements, of the certainty of which they have no experience.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged to the la&s;ting ho|nour of the noble Lord who pre&s;ides at the head of the admiralty board, and who patro|nized the undertaking, that the means to ren|der it &s;ucce&s;sful, was in every re&s;pect propor|tioned to the importance of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els that were made choice of were the propere&s;t that could be devi&s;ed. Bomb ketches are in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;toutly built, and not being over large, are be&s;t adapted for navigating &s;eas that are known to abound with &s;hoals and covered rocks: the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides their natural &s;trength, were &s;heathed with plank of &s;ea&s;oned oak three inches thick, to fortify them again&s;t the &s;hocks and pre&s;&s;ure of the ice, that, in their progre&s;s, they mu&s;t infallibly en|counter. They were, be&s;ides, furni&s;hed with a double &s;et of ice poles, anchors, cables, &s;ails and rigging, to provide again&s;t the terrible ef|fects of the &s;evere and tempe&s;tuous weather, that frequently happens in high latitudes, even in the middle of the mo&s;t temperate &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Nor was his Lord&s;hip le&s;s careful to provide for the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the men, than for the pre&s;ervation of their lives, by his
<PB N="xxvii" REF="392">
wi&s;e directions in equipping their &s;hips. His fir&s;t care was, to i&s;&s;ue orders for killing and curing a &s;ufficient quantity of beef and pork in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, that their provi&s;i|ons might be good and fre&s;h; and his next, to cau&s;e one hundred buts of porter to be brewed with the be&s;t malt and hops, that they might have proper drink to fortify them again&s;t the rigour of the climate they were about to pa&s;s. Their pea&s;e, oatmeal, rice and molo&s;&s;us, were all provided with equal care, and when all things were in readine&s;s, the beer was &s;towed in the holds, and the vacancies filled up with coals, which &s;erved as balla&s;t, that firing might not be wanting to warm and dry them when cold, or wet with labour, or with watching. Add to this, that a double quantity of &s;pirits were put on board, with a large proportion of wine, vinegar, mu&s;tard, &amp;c. &amp;c. and what, we believe, was never before thought of in the fitting out of any King's &s;hips, a con&s;iderable quantity of tea and &s;ugar for the &s;ick, in ca&s;e any &s;hould be &s;eized with that dreadful di&s;order, which rendered &s;hip provi&s;ions loath&s;ome to Capt. James's men, who were con&s;trained to winter in Charlton I&s;land in 1632. The&s;e men fell &s;ick and had &s;ore mouths, and could nei|ther eat beef, pork, fi&s;h, nor potage; the Sur|geon was every morning and evening obliged to pick their teeth, and cut away the pieces of rotten fle&s;h from their gums, yet they could eat
<PB N="xxviii" REF="393">
nothing but bread pounded in a mortar, and fried in oil, on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal months. In ca&s;e of accidents of this kind, and that tea &s;hould fail to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of nou|ri&s;hment, a quantity of portable &s;oup was like|wi&s;e provided. And to compleat the whole, a &s;tock of warm cloathing was laid in, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix fearnought jackets for each man, two milled caps, two pair of fearnought trow&s;ers, four pair of milled &s;tockings, and an excellent pair of boots, with a dozen pair of milled mitts, two cotton &s;hirts, and two handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>Thus equipped and provided, the command of the Race Hor&s;e was given to the Hon. Con&s;tantine Phipps, as Commodore, and that of the Carcar&s;e to Capt. Skiffington Lutwych; the fir&s;t mounting eight &s;ix pounders and four|teen &s;wivels, burthen three hundred and fifty tons; the latter four &s;ix pounders and fourteen &s;wivels, burthen three hundred tons.</P>

to the number of men that it had been thought proper to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>On Friday the 4th being off Sheerne&s;s, the wind we&s;t by north, and a fre&s;h breeze, they took their departure, and continued their voyage without any material occurrence happening till Tue&s;day the 15th, when the Commodore made the &s;ignal to lie to. They were then off Bra&s;&s;ey I&s;land, and many fi&s;hing-boats from Shetland being in &s;ight, the men were invited on board, and &s;ome fi&s;h purcha&s;ed of them at a cheap rate.</P>
<P>On the 17th they took a new departure from Shetland, but the day following the fog thick|ened &s;o much, that it almo&s;t approached to to|tal darkne&s;s. During the continuance of the fog, the Commodore kept firing guns and beat|ing drums, to prevent the Carca&s;e from lo&s;ing company. As it was impo&s;&s;ible that one could &s;ee the other at a &s;hip's length, it was found the more nece&s;&s;ary to repeat and return the firing, le&s;t they &s;hould run foul of each other before they could be apprized of their danger. About five in the morning the mi&s;t cleared up, and about nine the Commodore being in &s;ight, made the &s;ignal to the Carca&s;e to &s;teer north-ea&s;t. They were then in latitude 60 degrees 52 mi|nutes north by ob&s;ervation; the north end of Shetland I&s;land bearing north by we&s;t one half we&s;t, &s;even or eight leagues.</P>
<P>On the 17th they ob&s;erved a &s;ail to the north-ea&s;t, which the Commodore brought to, and
<PB N="31" REF="396">
&s;poke with. The breeze fre&s;h, the weather hazy, and the wind variable, the Carca&s;e carri|ed away her main-top-ma&s;t &s;tudding &s;ail yard; which, however, was very &s;oon &s;upplied. La|titude this day by ob&s;ervation 62 degrees 53 mi|nutes north.</P>
<P>Friday the 18th, being in the latitude of 65 degrees 9 minutes north, the cloathing allowed by the Government, of which notice has alrea|dy been taken in the Introduction, was deliver|ed out, and officers as well as men received their full proportion. This day the weather conti|nued as before.</P>
<P>Saturday the 19th the weather varied to every point of the compa&s;s, the Commodore brought to, and &s;poke with the Carca&s;e. Made &s;ail about three in the morning, and at nine a large &s;well. Tacked and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward. La|titude 66 degrees 1 minute north; longitude from London 33 minutes we&s;t.</P>
<P>Sunday the 20th they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e to the ea&s;tward, with the wind north-we&s;t, but variable; high breezes and clear air. They were now within the Polar circle, and at mid|night had an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un, and found their latitude 66 degrees 52 minutes north. Sounded on board the Commodore with a lead of one hundred weight, and a line of &s;even hundred and eighty fathom, to which was fa&s;|tened a thermometer of Lord George Caven|di&s;h's con&s;truction. They found no bottom,
<PB N="32" REF="397">
but the water was eleven degrees colder at that depth than on the &s;urface. The Carca&s;e &s;ounded with four hundred and fifty fathoms only.</P>
<P>Monday 21, light breezes and cloudy wea|ther. They ob&s;erved a whale on the north-ea&s;t quarter, the fir&s;t they had yet &s;een in the north &s;eas. The weather now began to &s;et in &s;evere; the nights cold and the days cloudy. The Commodore ob&s;erving a whaling &s;now with Hamborough colours flying, fired a &s;hot, and brought her to. She happened to be homeward bound with &s;eals, and Mr. Wyndham, a gen|tleman of fortune, who had embarked on board the Commodore, with a view to pro&s;ecute the voyage, finding nothing but foul weather and heavy &s;eas, to gratify his curio&s;ity, and being withal unable to endure the &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, took pa&s;&s;age on board the Hamburgher, in order to return home; and having taken leave of his friends, by wi&s;hing them a happy voyage, the Snow's boat took him on board about &s;even in the morning, and at eight the Commodore and Carca&s;e pur&s;ued their voyage.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 22, the articles of war were read on board the Carca&s;e. The weather began to be piercing cold; they had reached the 70th degree of north latitude, in a cour&s;e nearly north, being only 14 minutes to the ea&s;tward of London; and from their leaving Shetland to this day, they had &s;een nothing remarkable; nor had any accident befallen either of the

This day it poured with rain; the air was thick, and the rain froze as it fell. Saw a large &s;hip to the north-we&s;t, &s;tand|ing &s;outhward, but wanting no information that &s;he could give, they pur&s;ued their voyage with|out &s;peaking to her.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 23, the rain continued; the weather hazy; heard three guns fire at a di&s;|tance, but &s;aw no &s;hip or other object. The whales are here in no great plenty, and few &s;hips appear in the open &s;ea in pur&s;uit of them.

<P>On Thur&s;day the 24th, the Commodore chang|ed his cour&s;e to ea&s;t north-ea&s;t; and on the 25th they were in latitude 74 degrees 7 minutes north, and in 8 degrees 32 minutes ea&s;t longi|tude from London.

It is remarkable, that the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold are more frequent here than in the more &s;outherly latitudes. It often changes from temperate to extreme cold; and that &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem likewi&s;e, that the ice frequent|ly changes its place in this latitude; or that it is more &s;olid near land than in the open &s;ea; for, on the 23d of June 1676, Capt. Wood, being more to the ea&s;tward, fell in with ice right a-head, not more than a league di&s;tant. He &s;teered along it, thinking it had openings, but found them to be bays. He &s;ounded, and found ground at one hundred and fifty-eight fathom, &s;oft green oar. In &s;ome places he found pieces of ice driving off a mile from the main body in &s;trange &s;hapes, re&s;embling &s;hips, trees, build|ings, bea&s;ts, fi&s;hes, and even men. The main body of ice being low and craggy, he could &s;ee hills of a blue colour at a di&s;tance, and valleys that were white as &s;now. In &s;ome places he ob&s;erved drift wood among the ice. Some of the ice he melted, and found it fre&s;h and good. This navigator never could advance far|ther to the north; but in &s;eeking to penetrate the ice was &s;hip-wrecked, as has been already related in the Introduction. He therefore judged
<PB N="35" REF="401">
the ice impenetrable, and that land or ice &s;ur|rounded the pole. Our navigators found al&s;o much wood in this latitude floating about the &s;hips, and &s;aw great flocks of birds.</P>
<P>Monday 28, the weather altered; the wind we&s;t. Fre&s;h breezes, with rain and &s;leet. Lat|ter part thick fog.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 29, being in latitude 78 degrees north, and in longitude 6 degrees 29 minutes ea&s;t from London, came in &s;ight of land, when the &s;hips brought to, and the Captains held a con&s;ultation concerning their future cour&s;e. The appearance of the land lay from ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t to north-ea&s;t; and this day they &s;poke with the Marquis of Rockingham, Greenland|man, who, by their reckoning, were then in latitude 79 degrees 40 minutes north, though by that of the Commodore, their latitude was only 78 degrees 3 minutes. This difference, it it probable, ari&s;es from not making the proper allowance for refraction in this high latitude. The Greenlandman pre&s;ented each of the Com|manders with a deer and a half, which they found well-flavoured veni&s;on, though not over fat. He likewi&s;e informed, that he had ju&s;t come from the ice, and that the day before, three whalers had been cru&s;hed to pieces by its clo&s;ing upon them &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 30, pur&s;ued their cour&s;e. Clou|dy weather. Half pa&s;t four in the morning &s;ounded, one hundred and twelve fathoms &s;oft
<PB N="36" REF="402">
blue mud. At this time Black Point, &s;o called from its dark appearance, bore north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t three quarters ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight leagues. At half pa&s;t &s;even, in the morning, &s;aw two &s;ail in the north-we&s;t quarter. At half pa&s;t twelve tacked and &s;tood to the ea&s;t. Sounded, and found ground at one hun|dred and fifteen fathom.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day July 1, light breezes and clear weather at midnight: the &s;un as bright as at noon day. Black Point ea&s;t one half &s;outh, di&s;tant &s;even leagues. At three in the morn|ing made Charles's I&s;land, and at nine &s;aw a &s;ail to the we&s;tward whaleing; they were then in latitude 78 degrees 18 minutes north, by ob|&s;ervation. Sounded, and found the &s;ame depth as before.</P>
<P>Friday 2, light airs and moderate weather. Lay to and took the altitude of a mountain, which they named Mount Parna&s;&s;us; found it from the level of the &s;ea to be three thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty feet high, covered with &s;now, and at a di&s;tance re&s;embling an ancient building, with &s;omething like a turret a-top. The foot of this mountain, with the hills ad|joining, have &s;ometimes a very fiery appear|ance, and the ice and &s;now on their &s;ides re&s;em|bling trees and &s;hrubs, gli&s;&s;en with a brilliancy that exceed the &s;plendor of the brighte&s;t gems. When this happens, a violent &s;torm generally
<PB N="37" REF="403">
&s;ucceeds. Here they &s;hot &s;ome &s;ea fowl, but of an oily ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Saturday 3, proved a perfect calm. They &s;poke with a Hollander, who foretold, that a degree or two farther north was the utmo&s;t extent of their progre&s;s this &s;ea&s;on. Having doubled Cape Cold, they anchored in fifteen fathom water, about three miles from the land, and &s;ent the boats a&s;hore for water, which they found in abundance, pouring down in little &s;treams from the rocks. At five in the after|noon, by the mean of four azimuths, the varia|tion was found to be 18 degrees 36 minutes we&s;t. Sounded, and found only &s;ixty-five fa|thoms, &s;oft brown mud. Mount Parna&s;&s;us ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t three or four leagues.&mdash;Among other rea&s;ons which Capt. Wood gave for wi&s;h|ing to be employed on the di&s;covery of the north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, one was, that he might have an opportunity of approaching the pole, in or|der to &s;ettle an hypothe&s;is, which he had long framed, whereby the inclination of the magne|tical needle under the horizon, in all latitudes and in all longitudes, with the variation of the compa&s;s, might be exactly determined. This na|vigator imagined two magnetical poles to exi&s;t: and that, by approaching the one, he &s;hould be able to determine the action of the other. It does not appear, that he ever explained his hypothe&s;is; and there never has been but one man, who&s;e name was Williams, &s;ince his
<PB N="38" REF="404">
time, who pretended to know any thing of the matter.</P>
<P>Saturday 4, light breezes and hazey weather. Sounded, and only twenty fathoms deep; rocky ground. Hacluit's Headland, or the nor|thermo&s;t point of Spit&s;bergen, bearing north by ea&s;t &s;even leagues. Many whalers in &s;ight. Latitude by ob&s;ervation 79 degrees 34 minutes north, longitude from London 8 degrees 10 minutes ea&s;t. Thermometer forty-&s;even.</P>
<P>Monday 5, at two in the afternoon &s;ounded, and only fifteen fathom water; rocky ground. Thick fog. The Race Hor&s;e fired guns as &s;ig|nals to keep company, which were an&s;wered by the Carca&s;e. A dreadful crackling was heard at a di&s;tance, which proved the da&s;hing and grinding of the loo&s;e pieces of ice again&s;t each other, which is heard at many leagues di&s;|tance. Hacluit's Headland &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh, di&s;tance &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 6, proved very foggy; the breezes &s;light, and i&s;lands of ice beginning to appear. At three in the afternoon the Commodore hauled up from a large body of packed ice, and the fog thickening, both &s;hips kept firing volleys of &s;mall arms, to prevent their lo&s;ing company. At half pa&s;t ten in the evening, the extremes of the ice &s;tretching from north-we&s;t to ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, the Commodore bore away; and at half pa&s;t twelve lo&s;t &s;ight of it. At half pa&s;t one in the morning heard a violent
<PB N="39" REF="405">
&s;urf to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. At two tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward. At half pa&s;t five the fog ga|thering, they began firing volleys of &s;mall arms. At &s;ix &s;aw the ice &s;tretching from ea&s;t by &s;outh, to north by ea&s;t; and at &s;even was within &s;ight of land. At ten Cloven Cliff &s;tood ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, di&s;tant about five or &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 7th, the weather cloudy. They found them&s;elves be&s;et among the loo&s;e ice, which increa&s;ing continually, gave them incredible trouble. Ob&s;erving that it thickened to the ea&s;tward, they hauled up, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward; but in tacking, they were in danger of running foul. It was with difficulty they could keep any cour&s;e, for the driffs of ice came &s;o thick, as to whirl the &s;hips about, as if in a whirl-pool.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 8, the weather &s;till remaining clou|dy, and the wind variable, both &s;hips &s;till were entangled in the ice; and the Carca&s;e being driven to leeward, hoi&s;ted out her long-boat to tow up with the Commodore. But the ice clo&s;ing very fa&s;t, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the boats to live. Orders were then given to tack and &s;tand to the &s;outhward; but the &s;hips not being able to make head again&s;t the accumulation of ice that continually gathered round them, were under a nece&s;&s;ity of applying to their ice-an|chors and poles, in order to warp through it. At half pa&s;t eight in the evening, the ice be|ginning
<PB N="40" REF="406">
to open, they again hoi&s;ted out their boats, and with difficulty towed the &s;hips round a cape of ice projecting from the main body, and at la&s;t got clear. At ten the boats were hoi&s;ted on board. In extricating them&s;elves from this dangerous &s;ituation, the Race Hor&s;e had her be&s;t bower-anchor &s;napt in the &s;hank, clo&s;e to the &s;tock, and the Carca&s;e lo&s;t her &s;tar|board bumpkin and head-rails.</P>
<P>It frequently happens, that &s;hips be&s;et among the ice in the manner above related, peri&s;h by being da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the &s;olid fields of ice, or cru&s;hed by the broken pieces crowd|ing upon one another, and ri&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t about the &s;hip, as to exceed the height of her &s;ides, and then there is no e&s;caping. They were told by &s;ome experienced &s;eamen, that the ice ri&s;es out of the &s;ea as high &s;ometimes as mountains; and that &s;everal of the&s;e mountains, by &s;trik|ing together and coale&s;cing, form the&s;e i&s;lands of ice that are frequently &s;een in the lower lati|tudes, driving up and down the &s;ea as the wind and tides direct them.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t danger to be apprehended, is, however, from the loo&s;e ice; for the whalers often moor their &s;hips to the &s;olid fields of ice, that at certain &s;ea&s;ons &s;eem to re&s;t upon the earth, and appear fixed to it, and there find the be&s;t fi&s;hing. In &s;uch &s;ituations it often happens, that little or no loo&s;e ice is to be &s;een; yet pre&s;ently upon a change of wind, or

the blowing of a &s;torm, it &s;hall pour in upon them &s;o &s;uddenly, that they &s;ometimes peri&s;h in it. It is not po&s;&s;ible to account for the a&s;to|ni&s;hing quantity that will gather in this manner in le&s;s than an hour's time.</P>
<P>Though it &s;eems to be agreed, that many of the large&s;t fields of ice are frozen to the depth of the &s;ea in which they are found, and that they are bedded on the &s;olid earth, yet it is equally certain, that they are often rent a&s;un|der by the raging billows; and that in break|ing, they produce the mo&s;t terrifying noi&s;e in nature; nay, it is a&s;&s;erted, that the cla&s;hing of the pieces of loo&s;e ice again&s;t each other, on any extraordinary agitation of the waves, is attended with a roaring &s;o loud, that a man who is near it can hardly hear the &s;ound of his own voice.</P>
<P>Friday the 9th, they hauled up to the we&s;t|ward, and lo&s;t &s;ight one of the other; but about nine next morning they came in &s;ight, and joined company. The weather being now piercing cold, the people had an additional quantity of porter and brandy delivered to them; two quarts of porter and a pint of bran|dy being now every man's daily allowance.</P>
<P>Saturday July the 10th, the breeze fre&s;h, and the weather cloudy. They &s;ailed between num|berle&s;s pieces of ice, among which they &s;aw &s;e|veral whales, but none of the whalers in pur|&s;uit of them. The ice now becoming &s;olid and
<PB N="42" REF="409">
compact, they found it impracticable to conti|nue their cour&s;e. And the di&s;covery of a pa&s;|&s;age to the pole in that direction (upon holding a con&s;ultation) appearing impracticable to every officer on board of both &s;hips, the Commo|dore, at &s;even in the evening, hauled clo&s;e to the wind; and the Carca&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he could extricate her&s;elf, followed his example. The weather continuing foggy, with rain and &s;now, the &s;ailors were almo&s;t worn out with turning and winding; and although they u&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t precaution in working through the nar|rows, yet they could not always avoid &s;triking again&s;t the mountains that every where &s;ur|rounded them. During this night's work, they &s;teered a hundred different cour&s;es, to follow the channels.</P>
<P>Sunday 11, having worked out of the ice, they &s;ailed along the main body, which ap|peared perfectly &s;olid and compact, without any pa&s;&s;age or inlet. This immen&s;e ma&s;s of ice extended north-ea&s;t, as far as they could &s;ee from the ma&s;t-head; and, no doubt, might be a continuation of that in which they were engag|ed a few days before. The &s;ea was now to|lerably clear, for they met with no more fields, and only a few detached i&s;lands. At half pa&s;t one in the morning they &s;aw the land from &s;outh by we&s;t, to &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t. At three in the morning they tacked; Cloven Cliff bearing &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ix miles. At &s;even
<PB N="43" REF="410">
tacked again. At eight the Commodore bore away, and the Carca&s;e &s;tood after him. Cloven Cliff &s;outh one half we&s;t, two or three leagues, latitude 79 degrees 56 minutes north.</P>
<P>Monday 12, at eight in the evening Cloven Cliff bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t four or five miles, they &s;ounded in fifteen fathoms water, and found a rocky bottom. Saw &s;everal Engli&s;h and Dutch Greenlanders at anchor in the Nor|ways: That being their rendezvous to the north|ward, they never chu&s;e to proceed farther. Here they found the current &s;etting &s;o fa&s;t to ea&s;tward, that they were forced to come to an anchor to keep from drifting on the ice; the &s;well from we&s;tward being &s;o great, that had that happened, it would of con&s;equence have &s;taved the &s;hips. At five in the morning a breeze from north-north-ea&s;t &s;pringing up, they weighed, and made &s;ail. At eight Hacluit's Headland we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t one half we&s;t, &s;ix or &s;even leagues, at noon latitude 80 degrees 2 minutes north.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 13, the weather being clear and calm, and a &s;trong ea&s;terly current &s;etting in, at eight in the evening they came to with their &s;tream anchors and hau&s;ers in forty fathoms water; but at nine a breeze &s;pringing up from the ea&s;tward, they weighed, and next day came to an anchor in Smearingburgh Harbour. Clo|ven Cliff ea&s;t one half &s;outh one mile. We&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="411">
point of Voogle land north-north-we&s;t one half we&s;t, di&s;tant one mile and a half; &s;oundings fif|teen fathom &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>Here they remained between five and &s;ix days to take in fre&s;h water, during which time our journali&s;t was employed in &s;urveying the country, which to a &s;tranger had a very awful and romantic appearance.</P>
<P>The country is &s;toney, and as far as can be &s;een full of mountains, precipices and rocks. Between the&s;e are hills of ice, generated, as it &s;hould &s;eem, by the torrents that flow from the melting of the &s;now on the &s;ides of tho&s;e tower|ing elevations, which being once congealed, are continually increa&s;ed by the &s;now in winter, and the rain in &s;ummer, which often freezes as &s;oon as it falls. By looking on the&s;e hills, a &s;tranger may fancy a thou&s;and different &s;hapes of trees, ca&s;tles, churches, ruins, &s;hips, whales, mon&s;ters, and all the various forms that fill the univer&s;e. Of the ice-hills there are &s;even, that more particularly attract the notice of a &s;tranger. The&s;e are known by the name of the &s;even ice-burgs, and are thought to be the highe&s;t of the kind in that country. When the air is clear, and the &s;un &s;hines full upon the&s;e mountains, the pro&s;pect is inconceivably brilliant. They &s;ome|times put on the bright glow of the evening rays of the &s;etting &s;un, when reflected upon gla&s;s, at his going down; &s;ometimes they appear of a bright blue, like &s;apphire, and &s;ometimes like the va|riable
<PB N="45" REF="412">
colours of a pri&s;m, exceeding in lu&s;tre the riche&s;t gems in the world, di&s;po&s;ed in &s;hapes wonderful to behold, all glittering with a lu&s;tre that dazzles the eye, and fills the air with a&s;to|ni&s;hing brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>Smearingburgh harbour, where they landed, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Dutch. Here they erected &s;heds and conveniences for boiling the oil from the fat of the whales, in&s;tead of bar|relling it up to be boiled at home. Here al&s;o, allured by the hope of gain, they built a vil|lage, and endeavoured to fix a colony: but the fir&s;t &s;ettlers all peri&s;hed in the en&s;uing winter. The remains of the village may be traced to this day; and their &s;toves, kettles, kardels, troughs, ovens, and other implements, remained in the &s;hape of &s;olid ice long after the uten&s;ils them&s;elves were decayed. Our voyagers were told, that the Ru&s;&s;ians have lately attempted the &s;ame thing, and that ten out of fifteen pe|ri&s;hed la&s;t winter in this &s;econd attempt.</P>
<P>Where every object is new, it is not ea&s;y for a &s;tranger to fix which fir&s;t to admire. The rocks are &s;triking objects: before a &s;torm they exhibit a fiery appearance, and the &s;un looks pale upon them, the &s;now giving the air a bright reflection. Their &s;ummits are almo&s;t always involved in clouds, &s;o that it is but ju&s;t po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ee the tops of them. Some of the&s;e rocks are but one &s;tone from bottom to top, appearing like an old decayed ruin. Others
<PB N="46" REF="413">
con&s;i&s;t of huge ma&s;&s;es, veined differently, like marble, with red, white, and yellow, and pro|bably, were they to be &s;awed and poli&s;hed, would equal, if not excel, the fine&s;t Egyptian marble we now &s;o much admire. Perhaps the di&s;tance and danger of carrying large blocks of &s;tones, may be the rea&s;on that no trials have been made to manufacture them. On the &s;outherly and we&s;terly &s;ides of the&s;e rocks grow all the plants, herbs, and mo&s;&s;es peculiar to this coun|try; on the northerly and ea&s;terly &s;ides the wind &s;trikes &s;o cold when it blows from the&s;e quarters, that it peri&s;hes every kind of vege|table. The&s;e plants grow to perfection in a very &s;hort time. Till the middle of May the whole country is locked up in ice; about the beginning of July the plants are in flower, and about the latter end of the &s;ame month, or beginning of Augu&s;t, they have perfected their &s;eed. The earth owes its fertility, in a great mea&s;ure, to the dung of birds, who build and breed their young here in the &s;ummer, and in the winter repair to more favourable climates.</P>
<P>The plants that are mo&s;t common in Spit&s;|bergen are &s;curvy-gra&s;s and crows-foot; there are be&s;ides &s;mall hou&s;e-leak, and a plant with aloe-leaves; an herb like &s;tone-crop; &s;ome &s;mall &s;nake-weed; mou&s;e-ear; wood-&s;traw|bery; periwinkle; and a herb peculiar to the country which they call the rock-plant. The leaves of this plant are in &s;hape like a
<PB N="47" REF="414">
man's tongue, above &s;ix feet long, of a dull yellow colour. The &s;talk is round and &s;mooth, and of the &s;ame colour with the leaf; it ri&s;es tapering, and &s;mells like mu&s;cles. It is an aquatic, and ri&s;es in height in proportion to the depth of water in which it is found. There are other plants and herbs, but the&s;e are the chief. Of flowers, the white poppy &s;eems the principal.</P>
<P>The rocks and precipices are full of fi&s;&s;ures and clefts, which afford convenient harbour for birds to lay their eggs, and breed their young in &s;afety. Mo&s;t of the&s;e birds are wa|ter-fowl, and &s;eek their food in the &s;ea. Some, indeed, are birds of prey; and pur&s;ue and kill others for their own &s;u&s;tenance, but the&s;e are rare. The water-fowl eat &s;trong and fi&s;hy, and their fat is not to be endured. They are &s;o numerous about the rocks, as &s;ometimes to darken the air when they ri&s;e in flocks; and they &s;cream &s;o horribly, that the rocks ring with their noi&s;e.</P>
<P>There are a few &s;mall birds like our &s;nipes, and a kind of &s;now-bird, but different from that found about Hud&s;on's bay. The gentle|men &s;hot &s;ome of the water-fowl, but they were &s;trong and ill-ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The ice-bird is a very beautiful little bird, but very rare. He is in &s;ize and &s;hape like a turtle-dove, but his plumage, when the &s;un &s;hines upon him, is of a bright yellow, like
<PB N="48" REF="415">
the golden ring in the peacock's tail, and al|mo&s;t dazzles the eye to look upon it.</P>
<P>The other inhabitants of this forlorn coun|try are white bears, deer, and foxes. How the&s;e creatures can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the winter, when the whole earth is covered with &s;now, and the &s;ea locked up in ice, is hardly to be conceived. It has been &s;aid, indeed, that when the ocean is all frozen over, and no &s;u&s;tenance to be pro|cured in this country, they travel &s;outherly to the warmer climates, where food proper for them abounds in the immen&s;e fore&s;ts of the northern continent. But whoever con&s;iders the va&s;t di&s;tance between Spit&s;bergen and the neare&s;t parts of the northern continent, will be as much at a lo&s;s to account for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e creatures in their journey, as in the de|&s;olate region where they undoubtedly remain. The bear is by far the be&s;t accommodated to the climate of which he is an inhabitant. He is equally at home on land and water, and hunts diligently for his prey in both. In &s;ummer he finds plenty of food from the refu&s;e of the whales, &s;ea-hor&s;es and &s;eals, which is thrown into the &s;ea by the whalers, and cover the &s;hores during the time of whaling; and they have be&s;ides a wonderful &s;agacity in &s;melling out the carca&s;es of the dead, let them be ever &s;o deeply buried in the earth, or covered with &s;tones. The dead therefore that annually are buried here may contribute, in &s;ome degree,
<PB N="49" REF="416">
to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a few of the&s;e creatures in winter; but the que&s;tion will &s;till recur, how the race of them &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before the whale-fi&s;hery had exi&s;tence, and before men found the way to this inho&s;pitable &s;hore. Di&s;qui&s;i|tions of this kind, as they are beyond the reach of human comprehen&s;ion, &s;erve only to rai&s;e our admiration of that omnipotent Being to whom nothing is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures, as they differ in nothing but their colour and &s;ize from tho&s;e commonly &s;hewn in England, need no de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The foxes differ little in &s;hape from tho&s;e we are acquainted with, but in colour there is no &s;imilitude. Their heads are black, and their bodies white. As they are bea&s;ts of prey, if they do not provide in &s;ummer for the long rece&s;s of winter, it were, one would think, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;urvive; yet they are &s;een in plenty, though, by their &s;ubtlety and &s;wiftne&s;s, they are not ea&s;y to be catched.</P>
<P>The Dutch &s;eamen report, that when they are hungry they will feign them&s;elves dead, and when the ravenous birds come to feed upon them, they ri&s;e and make them their prey.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t wonderful thing of all is, how the deer can &s;urvive an eight months famine. Like ours they feed upon nothing that can be perceived, but the vegetables which the earth &s;pontaneou&s;ly produces; and yet for eight months in the year, the earth produces neither
<PB N="50" REF="417">
plant, herb, &s;hrub, or blade of any kind of gra&s;s whatever. They are, be&s;ides, but thinly cloathed for &s;o &s;evere a climate, and what &s;eems &s;till wor&s;e, there is not a bu&s;h to be &s;een to &s;helter them, within the di&s;tance that any man has yet di&s;covered. The means of their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t therefore remain among the &s;ecrets of nature, never to be di&s;clo&s;ed, as no human being can ever live here, &s;o as to be able to trace the&s;e creatures to their winter's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Amphibious creatures abound the mo&s;t about the &s;ounds and bays of Spit&s;bergen, and they &s;eem be&s;t adapted to endure the climate. The&s;e are the &s;eals, or &s;ea dogs, and mor&s;es, or &s;ea hor&s;es; of which the whalers avail them&s;elves, when di&s;appointed in compleating their lading with the fat of whales.</P>
<P>The &s;eal is &s;ufficiently known; but the &s;ea-hor&s;e, as it is a creature peculiar to high lati|tudes, is therefore more rare. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay how he came by his name; for there is no more likene&s;s between a &s;ea-hor&s;e and a land-hor&s;e, than there is between a whale and an ele|phant. The &s;ea-hor&s;e is not unlike the &s;eal in &s;hape. He has a large round head, larger than that of a bull, but &s;haped more like that of a pug-dog without ears, than any other animal we are acquainted with. He tapers all the way down to the tail, like the fi&s;h we call a lump, and his &s;ize is equal to that of the large&s;t &s;ized ox. His tu&s;ks clo&s;e over his under jaw, like
<PB N="51" REF="418">
tho&s;e of a very old boar, and are in length from one foot to two or more, in proportion to the &s;ize and age of the animal that breeds them. His &s;kin is thicker than that of a bull, and covered with &s;hort mou&s;e-coloured hair, which is &s;leeker and thicker, ju&s;t as he happens to be in or out of &s;ea&s;on when he is caught. His paws, before and behind, are like tho&s;e of a mole, and &s;erve him for oars when he &s;wims, and for legs to crawl when he goes upon the ice, or on &s;hore. He is a fierce animal, but being un|weildy when on land, or on the ice, is ea&s;ily overcome.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are always found in herds, &s;ometimes of many hundreds together, and if one is attacked, the re&s;t make a common cau&s;e, and &s;tand by one another till the la&s;t ga&s;p. If they are attacked in the water, they will fight de&s;perately, and will even attempt the boats of their pur&s;uers, if any of them are wounded, and not mortally. Some of them have been known to make holes in the bottom of the boat with their tu&s;ks, in defence of their young. Their eyes are large, and they have two holes in the upper part of the neck, out of which they eject the water, in like manner as it is ejected by whales.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ea about Spit&s;bergen is full of fi&s;h, yet they rather appear to be de&s;igned by Providence for the &s;u&s;tenance of one another, than for the food of man. The mackarel, of
<PB N="52" REF="419">
which there are no great plenty, &s;eem not only to be the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, and the mo&s;t pala|table, but al&s;o the mo&s;t beautiful. They &s;eem to be a different &s;pecies to tho&s;e caught upon our coa&s;ts. The upper part of the back is of a vivid blue; the other part as low as the belly of a gem-like green on an azure ground. Un|derneath the belly the colour is a tran&s;parent white, and the fins &s;hine like poli&s;hed &s;ilver. All the colours glow when alive in the &s;ea with &s;uch a richne&s;s, that fancy can hardly form to it&s;elf any thing in nature more beautiful. Al|mo&s;t all the other fi&s;h on this coa&s;t are of an oily nature, and of a very indifferent flavour.</P>
<P>The &s;aw, or &s;word fi&s;h, is remarkable not only for the oddity of his &s;hape, but al&s;o for his enmity to the whale. This fi&s;h takes his name from a broad flat bone, in length from two to four feet, which projects from his no&s;e, and tapers to a point. On each &s;ide, it has teeth like a comb, at the di&s;tance of a finger's breadth a&s;under. He is al&s;o furni&s;hed with a double row of fins, and is of a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trength in the water. His length from ten to twenty feet. He &s;eems to be formed for war, and war is his profe&s;&s;ion. The conflict betwixt him and the whale is dreadful, yet he never gives over till his &s;word is broken, or he comes off victorious.</P>
<P>The whale is a harmle&s;s fi&s;h, and is never known to fight but in his own defence. Yet
<PB N="53" REF="420">
when he is exa&s;perated, he rages dreadfully. Though from his magnitude, he may be called the &s;overeign of the &s;eas; yet, like other &s;ove|reigns, he is liable to be vexed and hurt by the meane&s;t reptiles. The whale's lou&s;e is a mo&s;t tormenting little animal. Its &s;cales are as hard as tho&s;e of our prawns; its head is like the lou&s;e's head, with four horns, two that &s;erve as feelers, the other two are hard, and curved, and &s;erve as clenchers to fix him to the whale. On his che&s;t, underneath, he has two carvers, like &s;cythes, with which he collects his food, and behind the&s;e are four feet, that &s;erve him for oars. He has, moreover, &s;ix other clenchers behind, with which he can rivet him|&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely to his prey, that he can no other|wi&s;e be di&s;engaged, but by cutting out the whole piece to which he is joined. He is joint|ed on the back like the tail of a lob&s;ter, and his tail covers him like a &s;hield when he is feeding. He fixes him&s;elf on the tendere&s;t parts of the whale's body, between his fins, on his &s;heath, and on his lips, and eats pieces out of his fle&s;h, as if eaten by vultures.</P>
<P>They found no &s;prings of fre&s;h-water in Spit&s;bergen; but in the valleys, between the mountains, are many little rills cau&s;ed by the rain and melting of the &s;now in &s;um|mer; and from the&s;e rills the &s;hips are &s;up|plied. Some are of opinion, that this water is
<PB N="54" REF="421">
unwhole&s;ome, but they are more nice than wi&s;e. The whaling people have drank of it for ages, and have found no ill effects from the u&s;e of it. Ice taken up in the middle of the&s;e &s;eas and thawed, yields al&s;o good fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>On board the Race Hor&s;e, Dr. Irvine, the gentleman who received the premium by a grant of parliament, for his di&s;covery of an ea&s;y pro|ce&s;s for making &s;alt-water fre&s;h at &s;ea, tried ma|ny experiments at Spit&s;bergen, and in the cour&s;e of the voyage; the re&s;ult of which will appear at a proper time. That gentleman had formed a project for pre&s;erving fle&s;h-meat fre&s;h and &s;weet in long voyages, but it did not an&s;wer in this.</P>
<P>In calm weather they remarked, that the &s;ea about the i&s;lands appeared uncommonly &s;till and &s;mooth; that it was not &s;uddenly moved at the fir&s;t approach of blowing weather; but that when the &s;torm continued, the waves &s;welled gradually, and ro&s;e to an incredible height.&mdash;The&s;e &s;welling waves &s;ucce&s;&s;ively follow one another, and roll along before the wind, foam|ing and raging in a frightful manner, yet they are thought le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e that break &s;hort, and are le&s;s mountainous.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that the ice that re&s;ted on the ground was not &s;tationary, but that it changed place; and they learnt al&s;o, that in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons there was no ice, where this &s;ea&s;on they were in danger of being embayed.
<PB N="55" REF="422">
There does not, however, from thence appear the lea&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that any practi|cable pa&s;&s;age to the Indian ocean can ever be found in this direction; for were it certain that the &s;eas were always open under the pole, yet great bulwarks of ice evidently &s;urround it, &s;ometimes at a le&s;s, and &s;ometimes at a greater di&s;tance. Moreover, were it po&s;&s;ible that chance &s;hould direct &s;ome fortunate adventurer to an opening at one time, it would be more than a million to one, if the &s;ame opening were pa&s;&s;a|ble to the next who &s;hould attempt it.</P>
<P>There are many harbours about Spit&s;bergen, be&s;ides that of Smearingburg, where &s;hips em|ployed in the whale fi&s;hery take &s;helter in &s;tor|my weather; and there are &s;ome i&s;lands, &s;uch as Charles's I&s;land, the Clifted Rock, Red-Hill, Hacluit's Headland, &amp;c. that &s;erve as land|marks, by which &s;eamen direct their cour&s;e. The&s;e i&s;lands are full of the ne&s;ts of birds; but their eggs are as nau&s;eous as the fle&s;h of the fowls that lay them. The &s;ailors &s;ometimes eat them, but they are filthy food. Even the gee&s;e and ducks on the neighbouring i&s;lands eat fi&s;hy and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The air about Spit&s;bergen is never free from i&s;icles. If you look through the &s;un beams tran&s;ver&s;ely as you fit in the &s;hade, or where you &s;ee the rays confined in a body, in&s;tead of dark motes, as are &s;een here, you &s;ee myriads of &s;hining particles that &s;parkle like diamonds;
<PB N="56" REF="423">
and when the &s;un &s;hines hot, as it &s;ometimes does, &s;o as to melt the tar in the &s;eams of &s;hips when they lie &s;heltered from the wind, the&s;e &s;hining atoms &s;eem to melt away, and de&s;cend like dew.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom that the air continues clear for many days together in this climate; when that happens, the whalers are generally &s;ucce&s;sful. There is no difference between night and day in the appearance of the atmo&s;phere about Spit&s;bergen, one being as light as the other, only when the &s;un is to the northward, you may look at him with the naked eye, as at the moon, without dazzling. The fogs here come on &s;o &s;uddenly, that from bright &s;un-&s;hine, you are pre&s;ently involved in &s;uch ob&s;curity, that you can hardly &s;ee from one end of the &s;hip to the other.</P>
<P>While our journali&s;t was bu&s;y in making his ob&s;ervations, all belonging to the &s;hips were differently engaged in one employment or other; &s;ome in taking in water, &s;ome in fi&s;h|ing, &s;ome in hunting, &s;ome in handing the &s;ails, and &s;preading them out to dry, &s;ome in &s;crub|bing the &s;hip, and &s;ome in viewing the coun|try. The Commanders and officers, with Mr. Lyon, Mr. Robin&s;on, &amp;c. bu&s;ied them&s;elves in making ob&s;ervations, being furni&s;hed with an apparatus, that is &s;aid to have co&s;t at lea&s;t one thou&s;and five hundred pounds. From &s;uch a &s;et of in&s;truments, in the hands of the able&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="424">
ob&s;ervers, the nation can boa&s;t, &s;ome very con|&s;iderable di&s;coveries in the phenomena of the polar regions may be expected. They landed their in&s;truments in a &s;mall i&s;land, in Vogle Sound, and had &s;everal opportunities during their &s;tay of u&s;ing them to advantage. Having erected two tents, the Captains from the fi&s;hery frequently vi&s;ited the ob&s;ervers, and expre&s;&s;ed their admiration not only at the perfection of the in&s;truments, but likewi&s;e at the dexterity with which they were accommodated.</P>
<P>The ice began to &s;et in a-pace, yet the weather was hot. The thermometer from fifty-&s;ix in the cabin ro&s;e to ninety in the open air. It was &s;till ten degrees higher on the top of a mountain to which it was carried. The i&s;land on which the experiments were made, they call|ed Marble I&s;land, from the rock by which it is formed. Having watered, and fini&s;hed their ob&s;ervations, the &s;hips prepared to depart.</P>
<P>Monday July the 19th, the Commodore made the &s;ignal to weigh; at two in the afternoon the &s;hips were under &s;ail, and as &s;oon as they had made their offing, &s;tood to the ea&s;tward. At three they tacked and &s;teered northward; and before four were again entangled among the loo&s;e ice, through which they &s;ailed, di|recting their cour&s;e along the main body, which lay from north-we&s;t to &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 20th, they continued their cour&s;e along the ice, but could di&s;cover no opening,
<PB N="58" REF="425">
though they &s;earched every creek, and left no bay or turning unexamined. This day they ob&s;erved what the &s;ailors call a mock-&s;un, a phaenomenon well enough known in this climate. Hacluit's Headland bore &s;outh-we&s;t one half &s;outh forty-&s;ix leagues; the weather cloudy, with rain; exce&s;&s;ive cold. Thermometer 37 degrees 46 minutes.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 21&s;t, the &s;everity of the wea|ther increa&s;ing, an additional quantity of bran|dy was &s;erved out to the people, and every com|fortable refre&s;hment afforded them, that they them&s;elves could wi&s;h or require. The cour&s;e of the ice lay this day north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 22, nothing remarkable.</P>
<P>Friday the 23d, they &s;aw land from ea&s;t by &s;outh, to &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh. At four in the morning, Hacluit's Headland bore &s;outh-ea&s;t ten leagues; the wind variable, and the weather cold, with &s;leet and &s;now. Thermometer 40 degrees.</P>
<P>Sunday 25, they had gentle breezes, with cloudy weather, and were engaged among &s;ome pieces of ice, &s;eparated from the main body, which kept them continually tacking and luffing. At length they entered among mountains and i&s;lands of ice, which came upon them &s;o fa&s;t, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty they could proceed; the Carca&s;e having &s;everal times &s;truck again&s;t them with &s;uch violence, as to rai&s;e her head four feet out of the water. They
<PB N="59" REF="426">
now imagined, from the &s;olidity and extent of the&s;e i&s;lands, that the late &s;trong gales had cau&s;ed a &s;eparation from the main body, the Commodore therefore changed his cour&s;e with a &s;trong gale to the ea&s;tward; in the morning the weather became moderate.</P>
<P>Monday 26, at &s;even in the morning, they came in &s;ight of Red-hill, a &s;mall mount which commands an open plain, known by the name of Deers-field, by rea&s;on of its fertile appearance, it being the only &s;pot on which they &s;aw no drifts of &s;now. To the ea&s;tward lies Muffin's I&s;land. Here they &s;ounded, and found forty five fathom water; rocky ground. Capt. Lutwich &s;ent out the long boat, with or|ders to &s;ound along the &s;hore, and to examine the &s;oil. This i&s;land is about a mile long, ve|ry low, and looks at a di&s;tance like a black &s;peck. Though the &s;oil is mo&s;tly &s;and and loo&s;e &s;tones, and hardly &s;o much as a green weed upon it, yet it is remarkable for the num|ber of birds that re&s;ort to it in &s;ummer to lay their eggs, and breed their young; and the&s;e not of one kind only, but of many different &s;orts, as gee&s;e, ducks, burgoma&s;ters, ice-birds, malamucks, kirmews, rotgers, and almo&s;t eve|ry other &s;pecies of birds peculiar to the climate; in&s;omuch, that the eggs were &s;o numerous, and lay &s;o thick upon the ground, that the men who landed found it difficult to walk without filling their &s;hoes.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="427">While the crew of the boat, ten in number, with their valiant officer at their head, were examining the i&s;land, after having &s;ounded the &s;hores, they ob&s;erved two white bears making towards them, one upon the ice, the other in the water. Major Buz, for that was their of|ficer's travelling title, like Fal&s;taff, was always the bolde&s;t man in company over a cup of &s;ack, and minded killing a bear no more than killing a gnat; but &s;eeing the bears approach very fa&s;t, e&s;pecially that which came in the water, he or|dered his men to fire while yet the enemy was at a di&s;tance, as he did not think it prudent to hazard the lives of his little company in clo&s;e fight. All of them pointed their mu&s;kets, and &s;ome of the party obeyed orders; but the greater part judging it &s;afer to depend upon a re&s;erved fire, when they had &s;eemingly di&s;charged their pieces, pretended to retreat. The Major, a full fathom in the belly, endeavoured to wad|dle after his companions; but being &s;oon out of breath, and &s;eeing the bear that came in the water had ju&s;t reached the &s;hore, thought of nothing now but falling the fir&s;t &s;acrifice. His hair already &s;tood an end; and looking behind him, he &s;aw the bear at no great di&s;tance, with his no&s;e in the air &s;nuffing the &s;cent. He had all the rea&s;on in the world to believe it was him that he &s;cented, and he had &s;carce breath enough left to call to his men to halt. In this critical &s;ituation he unfortunately dropt his gun,
<PB N="61" REF="428">
and in &s;tooping to recover it &s;tumbled again&s;t a goo&s;e-ne&s;t, fell &s;qua&s;h upon his belly into it, and had very nigh &s;mothered the dam upon her eggs. The old &s;aying is, misfortunes &s;eldom come alone. Before he could well ri&s;e, the en|raged gander came flying to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his half-&s;mothered con&s;ort, and making a dart at the eye of the a&s;&s;ailant, very narrowly mi&s;&s;ed his mark, but di&s;charged his fury plump upon his no&s;e. The danger now being pre&s;&s;ing, and the battle &s;erious, the bear near, and the gan|der ready for a &s;econd attack, the men, who had not fled far, thought it high time to return to the relief of their leader. Overjoyed to &s;ee them about him, but frighted at the bear ju&s;t behind him, he had forgot the gander that was over his head, again&s;t which one of the men having levelled his piece, fired and he fell dead at the Major's feet. Animated now by the death of one enemy, he recovered his gun, and faced about to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the attack of the &s;econd. By this time the bear was &s;carce ten yards from him, and beginning to growl, the Major ju&s;t in the in&s;tant was &s;eized with a loo&s;ene&s;s, dropt his accoutrements, and fell back, that he might not be in the way of his party, to impede the engagement. In the hurry he was in, for in a man of &s;uch valour we mu&s;t not &s;ay the fright, he entangled his buttons, and not being able to hold any longer, he filled his breeches. The crew in an in&s;tant had brought down the bear,
<PB N="62" REF="429">
and now it was time for their leader to do &s;ome|thing great. Having recovered his arms, and &s;eeing the poor bea&s;t groveling on the ground, and growling out his la&s;t, like a ram in a pin|fold, making a &s;hort race backwards in order to redouble his force, he came with nine long &s;trides forwards, and with the &s;trength and fiercene&s;s of an enraged bull, thru&s;t his lance full four feet deep in the dying bear's belly. And now, &s;ays the Major, cocking his hat, have not I done for the bear bravely! The &s;ailors, who are always in a good humour upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; but Captain, &s;aid they, you have but half done your work, you have another bear to kill yet. The Major, who&s;e &s;ituation began to be trouble&s;ome, content with the honour he had already acquired, my lads, &s;aid he, as I have been the death of one bear, &s;ure &s;ix of you may kill the other; &s;o ordering four of them to row him on board, he left the re|maining &s;ix to kill the other bear.</P>
<P>On this i&s;land two bears were killed, and a &s;ea-hor&s;e. The &s;ea-hor&s;e made a de&s;perate de|fence, being attacked in the water; and had there been only one boat engaged in the com|bat, he certainly would have come off victo|rious; but the crew of the Race-hor&s;e having learnt that there were bears and &s;ea-hor&s;es on this little &s;pot, were willing to &s;hare in the &s;port of hunting them, as well as in the plea|&s;ure of ta&s;ting their fle&s;h. They accordingly
<PB N="63" REF="430">
landed in their boats, and came in good time to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pur&s;uing the conque&s;t. It happened, however, that their ammunition being almo&s;t &s;pent, one great bear came up to revenge the death of his fellows, and advanced &s;o furiou&s;ly, growling and barking, that he put the whole company to flight, and &s;ome of them, it is &s;aid, had no great rea&s;on to laugh at the Major.</P>
<P>On &s;ounding the &s;hores they remarked, that when the north i&s;lands bear north forty-five ea&s;t, &s;even or eight leagues, and Red-hill ea&s;t by &s;outh five miles, there is generally from twenty-five to thirty fathom hard ground; but that clo&s;er on &s;hore, when Red-hill bears ea&s;t one-fourth &s;outh about one mile, it increa&s;es to one hundred and fifteen fathom, with &s;oft black mud. The current about one mile an hour to the north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 27, the air being perfectly &s;erene, and the weather moderate, the fi&s;hes &s;eemed to enjoy the temperature, and to expre&s;s it by their &s;porting. The whales were &s;een &s;pouting their fountains towards the &s;kies, and the fin fi&s;h following their example. They likewi&s;e this day &s;aw dolphins; the whole pro&s;pect in &s;hort was more plea&s;ing and picture&s;que than they had yet beheld in this remote region. The very ice in which they were be&s;et looked beau|tiful, and put forth a thou&s;and glittering forms, and the tops of the mountains, which they could &s;ee like &s;parkling gems at a va&s;t di&s;tance, had
<PB N="64" REF="431">
the appearance of &s;o many &s;ilver &s;tars illumi|nating a new firmament. But this flattering pro&s;pect did not continue long. By an accu|rate ob&s;ervation, they were now in latitude 80 deg. 47 min. north; and in longitude 21 deg. 10 min. ea&s;t from London; and in &s;ight of &s;even i&s;lands to the north, to which they directed their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 28, they had fre&s;h ea&s;terly breezes, which, from moderate weather the day before, changed to piercing cold. At midnight the we&s;t end of Weygate &s;traits bore &s;outh by ea&s;t, &s;o that they were now in the very &s;pot where Barentz had &s;uppo&s;ed an opening would be found into the polar &s;ea. Yet &s;o far from it, they could di&s;cover nothing from the ma&s;t-head, but a continued continent of &s;olid ice, except the i&s;lands already mentioned. On this ice, however, there were many bears, &s;ome of which came &s;o near the &s;hips as to be &s;hot dead with &s;mall arms. The&s;e bears are very good eating, and where no better is to be purcha&s;ed, the whalers account them as good as beef. They are many of them larger than the large&s;t oxen, and weigh heavier. In many parts of their body they are mu&s;ket proof, and unle&s;s they are hit on the open che&s;t, or on the flank, a blow with a mu&s;ket ball will hardly make them turn their backs. Some of the bears killed in the&s;e encounters weighed from &s;even to eight hundred weight; and it was thought, that the
<PB N="65" REF="432">
bear that routed the &s;ailors on Muffin's I&s;land, could not weigh le&s;s than a thou&s;and weight. He was, indeed, a very mon&s;ter!</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 29, &s;ailing among innumerable i&s;lands of ice, they found the main body too &s;olid for the &s;hips to make the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon it, and finding no opening, the Commo|dore re&s;olved to &s;end a party under the com|mand of the fir&s;t Lieutenant to examine the land, which at a di&s;tance appeared like a plain, diver&s;ified with hills and mountains, and ex|hibited in their &s;ituation a tolerable land&s;kip.</P>
<P>On trying the water, it was le&s;s &s;alt than any &s;ea water they had ever ta&s;ted; and they found likewi&s;e, that the ice was no other than a body of congealed fre&s;h water, which they imagined had been frozen in the infancy of the earth.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 30, the weather being clear, they ran clo&s;e to the main body of the ice, and the &s;un continuing to &s;hine, made them almo&s;t for|get the climate they were &s;ailing in, but it was not long before they had rea&s;on for &s;evere re|collection. In coa&s;ting along, they ob&s;erved many openings, and were in hopes, from their di&s;tant appearance, that a pa&s;&s;age might be made between them; but upon trial it was found, as the Dutch fi&s;hermen had foretold, that the&s;e appearances were deceitful. At one in the morning fine clear &s;un-&s;hine, they &s;ound|ed in &s;ixteen fathom water, and found &s;mall &s;tones at bottom. They were then about four

miles from the north-ea&s;t part of the northern|mo&s;t land; the ea&s;ternmo&s;t land in &s;ight, di&s;tant about five or &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P>Saturday 31, at midnight, the ea&s;ternmo&s;t land in &s;ight lay ea&s;t-north ea&s;t one half ea&s;t, which they could not make out to be an i&s;land. They rather judged it to be a continent, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to determine with certainty, as it lay beyond their reach. At nine in the morning the Carca&s;e hoi&s;ted out her cutter, and filled her empty water-ca&s;ks with water from the ice. On this ice he great quantities of &s;now, and as &s;oon as a pit is dug, it fills with fine &s;oft clear water, not inferior to that of ma|ny land &s;prings. At noon they &s;ounded in ninety five fathoms, the ground &s;oft mud. This day a bear came over the ice to vi&s;it them, the fir&s;t they had &s;een &s;ince they left Muffin's I&s;land. They &s;aluted him with a volley of &s;mall arms, and he returned the compliment, by turning his back upon them. Their longi|tude was this day 21 degrees 26 minutes ea&s;t, by time-keeper. Thermometer forty-five.</P>
<P>Sunday Augu&s;t 1, proved a day of trial. Lying too among the clo&s;e ice, with the loo&s;e ice driving fa&s;t to &s;hore, the Commodore was de&s;irous of &s;urveying the we&s;ternmo&s;t of the &s;even i&s;lands, which appeared the highe&s;t, in order to judge, from the pro&s;pect on the hills, of the po&s;&s;ibility of proceeding farther on the di&s;covery. With this view they carried out
<PB N="67" REF="434">
their ice-anchors, and made both &s;hips fa&s;t to the main body, a practice very common with the fi&s;hing &s;hips that annually frequent tho&s;e &s;eas. Of the reconnoitring party, were the Captains, the &s;econd Lieutenants, one of the mathematicians, the pilots, and &s;ome cho&s;en &s;ailors, &s;elected from both &s;hips. They &s;et out about two in the morning, and &s;ometimes &s;ail|ing, &s;ometimes drawing their boats over the ice, they with difficulty reached the &s;hore, where the fir&s;t objects they &s;aw were a herd of deer, &s;o very tame, that they &s;eemed as curious to gaze at the &s;trangers, as the &s;tran|ges were plea&s;ed to &s;ee them; for they came five or &s;ix together &s;o near, that they might have been killed with the thru&s;t of a bayonet; a proof that animals are not naturally afraid of man, till, by the fate of their a&s;&s;ociates, they are taught the danger of approaching them; a proof too, that animals are not de&s;titute of reflection, otherwi&s;e how &s;hould they conclude, that what has befallen their fellow animals, will certainly happen to them, if they run the like ri&s;que. The gentlemen, however, &s;uffered only one of the&s;e fearle&s;s innocents to be fired at, and that was done by a &s;ailor when they were ab&s;ent on ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>On this i&s;land they gathered &s;ome &s;curvy-gra&s;s, and in many places they could perceive the &s;ides of the hills covered with the verdure on which the&s;e deer undoubtedly fed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="435">After having a&s;cended the highe&s;t hills on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and taken a view of the country and the ocean all round, the gentlemen de&s;|cended, and about five in the afternoon em|barked again on their return to the &s;hips, at which they arrived &s;afe about ten, after an ab|&s;ence of twenty hours. They were greatly di&s;appointed by the hazine&s;s of the weather on the tops of the mountains, which confined the pro&s;pect, and prevented their taking an ob&s;er|vation with the in&s;truments they had carried with them for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is here a &s;mall variation in the journals of the two &s;hips; that kept on board the Com|modore making the di&s;tance between the i&s;land and the &s;hips near twenty miles; the other only five leagues, which might ea&s;ily happen, as the &s;hips &s;hifted their &s;tations with the main body of ice, &s;ometimes driving north-we&s;t, &s;ome|times the contrary cour&s;e, as the wind and tides happened to &s;it.</P>
<P>Their &s;ituation now began to be &s;erious, and it was di&s;covered too late, that by grappling to the ice, as practi&s;ed by the Greenlandmen, they had endangered the lo&s;s of the &s;hips, the loo&s;e ice clo&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t about them, that they found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to get them di&s;engaged; and there was, be&s;ides, great rea&s;on to fear, that one or both would &s;oon be cru&s;hed to pieces. Great minds are ever mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by their expedients on the mo&s;t alarming
<PB N="69" REF="436">
occa&s;ions. The Commodore &s;et all hands to work to form a dock in the &s;olid ice, large enough to moor both &s;hips; and by the alacri|ty with which that &s;ervice was performed, the &s;hips were pre&s;erved from the danger of imme|diate de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;hips being thus far &s;ecured, the of|ficers, pilots, and ma&s;ters, were all &s;ummoned on board the Commodore, to con&s;ult on what further was to be done in their pre&s;ent unpro|mi&s;ing &s;ituation; when it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that their deliverance was hopele&s;s; and that they mu&s;t either provide to winter upon the adjacent i&s;lands, or attempt to launch their boats into the open &s;ea, which was already at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; for the loo&s;e ice had poured into the bay in which they were at an|chor with &s;o much rapidity, and in &s;uch a&s;to|ni&s;hing quantities, that the open &s;ea was alrea|dy far out of &s;ight. Before any thing farther was undertaken, the men were ordered to their quarters, that they might refre&s;h them&s;elves with &s;leep.</P>
<P>While their Commanders pre&s;erve their for|titude, the &s;ailors never lo&s;e their courage. They ro&s;e in the morning with as much alacrity and unconcern, as if they had been &s;ailing with a fine breeze in the Briti&s;h Channel.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 2, it was now thought advi&s;eable to make one de&s;perate attempt to extricate the &s;hips, by cutting a channel to the we&s;tward into
<PB N="70" REF="437">
the open &s;ea. The &s;cooping out the dock with &s;o much expedition, by a party only of one &s;hip, rai&s;ed high expectations of what might be performed by the united labours of both the crews. No body of men ever undertook a work of &s;uch difficulty with &s;o much chearful|ne&s;s and confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, as the &s;ailors ob&s;erved on this occa&s;ion. Their ice-&s;aws, axes, &s;ledges, poles, and the whole group of &s;ea-tools, were in an in&s;tant all employed in facilitating the work; but after cutting through blocks of &s;olid ice from eight to fifteen feet deep, and coming to others of many fathoms, that ex|ceeded the powers of man to &s;eparate, that was laid a&s;ide as a hopele&s;s project; and another more promi&s;ing, though not le&s;s laborious, a|dopted in its room.</P>
<P>On the 3d of Augu&s;t, after the men had again refre&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;leep, it was re&s;olved to fit up the boats belonging to both the &s;hips with &s;uch coverings as were mo&s;t ea&s;y to be accommodated, and of lighte&s;t convey|ance; and by &s;kating them over the ice, endea|vour to launch them in the open &s;ea. Could this be effected, they hoped, that by &s;ailing and rowing to the northernmo&s;t harbour of Spit&s;|bergen, they might arrive at that i&s;land, before the departure of the la&s;t &s;hips belonging to the fi&s;hery for Europe.</P>
<P>While the boats were getting ready for this expedition, a &s;econd party were di&s;patched to
<PB N="71" REF="438">
the i&s;land, with orders to take the di&s;tance as exact as it was po&s;&s;ible to the neare&s;t open &s;ea. As all the people belonging to the &s;hips were not to be engaged in the&s;e &s;ervices, tho&s;e who were unemployed diverted them&s;elves in hunting and killing the bears, that now, attracted per|haps by the &s;avory &s;mell of the provi&s;ions dre&s;&s;ed on board the &s;hips, came every day over the ice to repeat their vi&s;its. Several of the&s;e were killed occa&s;ionally, and this day they fought a &s;ea-hor&s;e, in which engagement the &s;econd Lieutenant of the Carca&s;e &s;ignalized his courage in a mo&s;t de&s;perate rencounter, in which, however, he &s;ucceeded, though his life was in imminent danger.</P>
<P>On the 4th the carpenters, &amp;c. were &s;till em|ployed in fitting up the boats. The pilots, who the day before had been &s;ent to make ob|&s;ervations on the i&s;lands already mentioned, made their report, that the neare&s;t water they had &s;een was about ten leagues to the we&s;tward; that in their pa&s;&s;age they had met with great numbers of &s;pars or pine trees, floating about the i&s;land, &s;ome of them of con&s;iderable &s;ize, with the bark rotted off, and the bodies much worm-eaten; that there was neither tree nor &s;hrub to be &s;een growing on any of the &s;even i&s;lands, nor upon any land that they had yet di&s;covered in that latitude, nor for ten degrees farther &s;outh, and that the trees they had &s;een mu&s;t therefore have come from a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="439" MS="y">Though there is nothing now in this ob&s;er|vation, the like being annually ob&s;erved by all the navigators who frequent tho&s;e &s;eas in the &s;ummer, and who collect their wood from tho&s;e drifts, yet the country from whence they pro|ceed has hitherto been thought a my&s;tery. But it being now certain, that many of the great rivers that flow through the northernmo&s;t parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, empty them&s;elves into this &s;ea; and that there is an open communication throughout the different parts of it at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, there &s;eems very little rea&s;on to doubt, but that tho&s;e trees are torn up by land floods, and are precipitated into the &s;ea by the rapidity of the &s;treams.</P>
<P>It has indeed been objected, that all the wood that is found floating in this manner about the i&s;lands in high latitudes, is to a piece barked and worm-eaten; and that if the&s;e trees were torn up and precipitated into the &s;ea in the manner above &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ome of it would appear &s;ound and unbarked, as in its fir&s;t &s;tate. To this it may be an&s;wered, that were the cour&s;e of the tides to run as con&s;tantly to the northward, as the cour&s;e of the rivers runs into the &s;ea, this objection would be unan&s;werable. But the very rever&s;e is known to be the fact; and that neither the winds nor the tides tend to the northwards for any con&s;iderable part of the year; &s;o that from the time the&s;e trees enter the ocean, it mu&s;t, in the ordinary cour&s;e of things, be many
<PB N="73" REF="440">
ages before they can reach the latitudes in which they are now found. Becau&s;e, if they are driven northwards by the &s;trength of a &s;torm from the &s;outh, they will be driven in another direction by the next &s;torm that happens from another quarter; and all the while the calm con|tinues, they will be driven to and fro by the tides, which, as has been ob&s;erved, &s;eldom &s;et long to the north, therefore, being in continual motion for ages, or being ca&s;t upon the &s;hore by tempe&s;ts, or high tides, and lying there expo&s;ed to the air, till tempe&s;ts or high tides return them again to the ocean, they will, in a long progre&s;&s;ion of time, be reduced to the &s;tate in which they are con&s;tantly found. This &s;olution is, however, offered with diffidence. The fact is certain, of much wood being annually found about the i&s;lands in que&s;tion; and it is now of little im|portance from whence it proceeds, as a pa&s;&s;age by the north ea&s;t to China will probably never more be &s;ought.</P>
<P>On the 5th they had gentle breezes; but about four in the morning &s;mall &s;leet. The ice &s;till &s;urrounding them, and appearing to grow more and more &s;olid and fixed, tho&s;e who had till now retained hopes that the &s;outh-ea&s;t wind would again di&s;unite its &s;ub&s;tance, and open a pa&s;&s;age for their deliverance, began to de&s;pair, as the wind had blown for twenty four hours from that quarter, from which alone they could have relief, and not the lea&s;t alteration to be
<PB N="74" REF="441">
perceived. The men, however, were as joyous as ever, and &s;hewed not the lea&s;t concern about the danger of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head of the Carca&s;e gave notice, that three bears were making their way very fa&s;t over the ice, and that they were directing their cour&s;e towards the &s;hip. They had, without que&s;tion, been invited by the &s;cent of the blubber of the &s;ea-hor&s;e killed a few days before, which the men had &s;et on fire, and which was burning on the ice at the time of their approach. They proved to be a &s;he bear and her two cubbs; but the cubbs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to the fire, and drew out from the flames part of the fle&s;h of the &s;ea-hor&s;e that remained uncon&s;umed, and eat it voraciou&s;ly. The crew from the &s;hip, by way of diver&s;ion, threw great lumps of the fle&s;h of the &s;ea-hor&s;e which they had &s;till left, out upon the ice, which the old bear fetched away &s;ing|ly, laid each lump before her cubbs as &s;he brought it, and dividing it, gave each a &s;hare, re&s;erving but a &s;mall portion to her&s;elf. As &s;he was fetching away the la&s;t piece they had to be|&s;tow, they levelled their mu&s;kets at the cubbs, and &s;hot them both dead; and in her retreat, they al&s;o wounded the dam, but not mortally. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but unfeeling minds, to have marked the affection|ate concern expre&s;&s;ed by this poor bea&s;t, in the
<PB N="75" REF="442">
dying moments of her expiring young. Tho' &s;he was &s;orely wounded, and could but ju&s;t crawl to the place where they lay, &s;he carried the lump of fle&s;h &s;he had fetched away, as &s;he had done the others before, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them, and when &s;he &s;aw that they refu&s;ed to eat, &s;he laid her paws fir&s;t upon one, and then upon the other, and endeavoured to rai&s;e them up. All this while it was pitiful to hear her moan. When &s;he found &s;he could not &s;tir them, &s;he went off, and when &s;he had got at &s;ome di&s;tance, looked back and moaned; and that not availing her to en|tice them away, &s;he returned, and &s;melling round them, began to lick their wounds. She went off a &s;econd time, as before, and having crawled a few paces, looked again behind her, and for &s;ome time &s;tood moaning. But &s;till her cubbs not ri&s;ing to follow her, &s;he returned to them again, and with &s;igns of inexpre&s;&s;ible fondne&s;s, went round one and round the other, pawing them, and moaning. Finding at la&s;t that they were cold and lifele&s;s, &s;he rai&s;ed her head towards the &s;hip, and, like Caliban in the tempe&s;t, growled a cur&s;e upon the murderers, which they returned with a volley of mu&s;ket-balls. She fell between her cubbs, and died licking their wounds. If what is related by a voyager of credit in the la&s;t century be true, the filial fondne&s;s of the&s;e animals is no le&s;s re|markable than the maternal. The young ones,
<PB N="76" REF="443">
&s;ays he, keep con&s;tantly clo&s;e to the old ones. We ob&s;erved that two young ones and an old one would not leave one another, for if one ran away, it turned back again immediately, as &s;oon as it did hear the others in danger, as if it would come to help them. The old one ran to the young one, and the young one to the old one; and rather than they would leave one another, they would &s;uffer them&s;elves to be all killed.</P>
<P>Friday the 6th, the weather calm, but fog|gy, and the winds variable; they di&s;covered that the drift of the &s;hip, with the whole body of ice, inclined fa&s;t to the ea&s;tward; and that they were already embayed in the very middle of the &s;even i&s;lands. They therefore &s;ent off the pilots of both &s;hips, with a party of &s;ailors, to the northernmo&s;t i&s;land, to &s;ee what di&s;co|veries could be made from the promontories there. They returned at night, after a fa|tiguing journey, with a di&s;mal account, that nothing was to be &s;een from thence but a va&s;t continent of ice, of which there was no end; and that the thought of wintering in &s;uch a &s;ituation was more dreadful, than that of pe|ri&s;hing by in&s;tant death.</P>
<P>Saturday 7, the wind &s;et in north-north-ea&s;t, veered to the north; to the north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t, piercing cold. This day the boats were all brought in readine&s;s on the ice, fitted with weather cloaths about thirteen inches above the
<PB N="77" REF="444">
gunnels, in order to keep off the cold as much as po&s;&s;ible, if by good fortune they &s;hould be enabled to launch them in an open &s;ea. This day was employed chiefly in boiling provi&s;ions to put in the boats for the intended voyage; in delivering out bags to the men to carry their bread, and in packing up &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as every one could take along with him; for now every man was to be his own porter, the nece&s;|&s;ary provi&s;ions and liquors being found load enough for the boats, and twenty-five days bread load enough for each man. This being adju&s;ted, when night approached they were all ordered on board to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 8, at &s;ix in the morning all hands were ordered to turn out, and a detachment of fifty men from each &s;hip, headed by their re|&s;pective officers, were appointed to begin the hard ta&s;k of hawling the launces along the ice. The brave&s;t and gallante&s;t actions performed in war, do not &s;o &s;trikingly mark the true cha|racter of a &s;ea Commander, as the readine&s;s and alacrity with which his orders are obeyed in times of imminent danger. Every one now &s;trove who &s;hould have the honour to be li&s;ted in the band of haulers, of whom the Commo|dore took the direction, leaving Capt. Lut|wych to take care of both the &s;hips, that if any favourable turn &s;hould happen in the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the ice, he might make u&s;e of the remaining part of both the crews to improve it.
<PB N="78" REF="445">
Upon a general con&s;ultation of officers, pre|vious to this undertaking, it had been agreed, and an order i&s;&s;ued accordingly, that no per&s;on on board, of whatever rank, &s;hould encumber him&s;elf with more cloaths than what he wore upon his back. Upon this occa&s;ion, therefore, the officers dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in flannels, and the common men put on the cloaths which the officers had thrown off. It was inconceiva|bly laughable to &s;ee the&s;e motley bands yoked in their new harne&s;s; and, to &s;ay the truth, there was not one &s;olemn face among the two companies. That headed by the Commodore drew &s;toutly for the honour of their leader, and that headed by their Lieutenants had their mu|&s;ic to play to them, that they might dance it away, and keep pace with the Commander in chief. Indeed the officers who headed them were de&s;ervedly beloved as well as their Com|manders, particularly Lieutenant Beard, who&s;e &s;teady and uniform conduct in times of the greate&s;t danger, cannot be &s;ufficiently admired or applauded. Neither &s;wayed by pa&s;&s;ion, nor di&s;concerted by the &s;udden embarra&s;&s;ments that often intervened, his conduct was always calm, and his orders re&s;olute. He never was heard, during the whole voyage on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emergencies, to enforce his commands with an oath, or to call a &s;ailor by any other than his u&s;ual name; and &s;o &s;en&s;ible were they of his manly behaviour, that, when the &s;hip was paid
<PB N="79" REF="446">
off at Deptford, they were only prevented by his mo&s;t earne&s;t reque&s;t from &s;tripping them|&s;elves to their &s;hirts, to cover the &s;treets with their cloaths, that he might not tread in the dirt in going to take coach.</P>
<P>In &s;ix hours, with the utmo&s;t efforts of hu|man labour, they had only proceeded a &s;ingle mile; and now it was time for them to dine, and recruit their almo&s;t exhau&s;ted &s;pirits. As the Commodore had laboured with them, it was in character that he &s;hould dine with them al&s;o; and an accident happened that made it nece&s;&s;ary for him &s;o to do. The Cook, with his mates, (who were bringing the Commodore and the officers their dinners under covers) to keep out the cold after coming from a warm fire-&s;ide, had made a little too free with the brandy bottle before they &s;et out, and before they had got half way to the lances, the liquor began to operate; the Cooks were &s;ometimes very near boarding each other, &s;ometimes they hauled off, and &s;ometimes &s;teered right a-head. At length coming to a cha&s;m, or parting of the ice, which they were obliged to leap, down came the ma&s;ter Cook, with di&s;h, cover, meat and all; and what was &s;till wor&s;e, though it was not then thought of much value, the Commodore's common &s;ervice of plate, which the Cook car|ried for the officers to dine on, fell in the cha&s;m, and in&s;tantly &s;unk to the bottom. This acci|dent brought the Cook a little to him&s;elf, and
<PB N="80" REF="447">
he now &s;tood pau&s;ing whether he &s;hould jump down the gulph after the plate, or proceed to the Commodore to beg mercy and make his apology. His mates per&s;uaded him to the lat|ter, as the Commodore was a kind-hearted gemman, and would never take a man's life away for a &s;lip on the ice. Be&s;ides, it was a great jump for a fat man, and Commodore, they were &s;ure, had rather lo&s;e all the plate in the great cabin, than lo&s;e Cookie. Comforted a little by this &s;peech, the Cook proceeded, but let his mates go on fir&s;t with what remained, to carry the tidings of what befell the re&s;t. When the Commodore had heard the &s;tory, he judged how it was with them all. But where is the Cook, &s;aid he to the mates? He's crying behind, an plea&s;e your Honour. In the mean time the Cook came up. Cook, &s;aid the Com|modore, bring me your dinner. I will dine to-day with my comrades. My dinner! Ay, a pound of the fle&s;h next my heart, if your Honour likes it. The promptne&s;s of the reply &s;hewed the &s;incerity of the Cook's good-will, and plea&s;ed the Commodore better than a fea&s;t upon turtle He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a &s;mile, and partook with the officers in what was left, who made up their dinners with a me&s;s from the common men.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t begun to renew their labour, when word was brought, that the whole body of ice had changed its &s;ituation, and was mov|ing
<PB N="81" REF="448">
to the we&s;tward; that the &s;hips were both a-float; and that the ice was parting. The joy which this news diffu&s;ed through the two com|panies of hawlers is ea&s;ier to conceive than ex|pre&s;s. They in&s;tantly &s;hook off their harne&s;s, ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t in working the &s;hips, and once more to re&s;ume their proper employments. When they arrived at the &s;hips, Captain Lut|wych, who was no le&s;s beloved by his men than the Commodore, had by his example and his judicious directions done wonders. Both &s;hips were not only a-float, with their &s;ails &s;et, but actually cut and warped through the ice near half a mile. This ray of hope, however, was &s;oon darkened; the body of ice &s;uddenly a&s;|&s;umed its former direction to the ea&s;tward, and clo&s;ed upon them again as fa&s;t as ever. While the &s;hips remained in the ice dock, they were la&s;hed together for their greater &s;ecurity, but now being launched and a-float, the ice pre&s;&s;ed upon them with &s;uch weight, that it was every moment expected that the haw&s;er would break that held them together; orders were therefore given, that the haw&s;er &s;hould be &s;lackened, and the &s;hips relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the evening, and till two in the morning, the drift continued ea&s;t|ward, and all that while the &s;hips were in dan|ger of being cru&s;hed by the clo&s;ing of the channel in which they rode. They had now drifted two miles to the ea&s;tward; the men were
<PB N="82" REF="449">
worn out with fatigue in defending the &s;hips with their ice-poles from being engulphed; and now nothing but &s;cenes of horror and perdition appeared before their eyes. But the Omnipo|tent, in the very moment, when every hope of deliverance from their own united endeavours had relinqui&s;hed them, interpo&s;ed in their fa|vours, and cau&s;ed the winds to blow, and the ice to part in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner, rending and cracking with a tremendous noi&s;e, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of the loude&s;t thunder. At this very in|&s;tant the whole continent of ice, which before was extended beyond the reach of &s;ight from the highe&s;t mountains, moved together in va|rious directions, &s;plitting and dividing into va&s;t bodies, and forming hills and plains of various figures and dimen&s;ions. All hearts were now again revived, and the pro&s;pect of being once more relea&s;ed from the frozen chains of the north in&s;pired the men with fre&s;h vigour. Every officer and every idler on board laboured now for life. The &s;ails were all &s;pread, that the &s;hips might have the full advantage of the breeze to force them through the channels that were already opened, and to help them, like wedges, to rend the clefts that were but ju&s;t cracking.</P>
<P>While the major part of the crews were em|ployed in warping the &s;hips with ice-anchors, axes, &s;aws and poles, a party from both &s;hips were di&s;patched to launch the boats. This was
<PB N="83" REF="450">
no ea&s;y ta&s;k to accompli&s;h. The ice, though &s;plit in many thou&s;and pieces, was yet frozen like an i&s;land round the lances, and though it was of no great extent, yet the boats were of a weight hardly to be moved by the &s;mall force that could be &s;pared to launch them. They were be&s;ides, by the driving of the ice, at more than five miles di&s;tance from the &s;hips; and at this time no channels of communication were yet opened. But Providence was manife&s;t even on this occa&s;ion; for the i&s;land on which the lan|ces &s;tood, parted while the men were hauling them, and by that lucky circum&s;tance they were launched with great facility, without the lo&s;s of a man, though the ice cracked, as it were, under their feet.</P>
<P>The people on board had not been able to force their way with the &s;hips much more than a mile, when the party in the lances joined them. And now, excited by what curio&s;ity or in&s;tinct is not ea&s;y to determine, &s;everal bears came po&s;ting over the ice to be &s;pectators of their departure, and advanced &s;o near the &s;hips, that they might have been ea&s;ily ma&s;tered, had not the men been more &s;eriou&s;ly employed.</P>
<P>This day they altered their &s;oundings from thirty to fifty fathoms, and from fifty to eighty and eighty-five fathoms.</P>
<P>The breeze continuing fre&s;h from ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t and ea&s;t, the ice &s;eemed to open as fa&s;t as it had before clo&s;ed when the wind blew

we&s;terly, and from the north; a &s;trong pre|&s;umptive proof of land to the ea&s;tward, which &s;topping the current of the loo&s;e ice in driving from the north and we&s;t, clo&s;es it in cour&s;e, and renders it compact. On the contrary, when the wind blows off the land, and the current &s;ets to the &s;ea, the loo&s;e ice being no longer op|po&s;ed, di&s;per&s;es it&s;elf again in the ocean, where it again floats, till the &s;ame cau&s;e produces the &s;ame effect. If therefore the land which our voyagers &s;aw on the 30th, and which they could not determine with certainty to be an i&s;land, &s;hould, upon &s;ome future occa&s;ion, be di&s;covered to be a continent, then the clo&s;ing of the loo&s;e ice &s;o &s;uddenly about the <HI>&s;even i&s;lands,</HI> and its crouding one piece upon ano|ther to a great height, when violently agitated by tempe&s;ts from the north or we&s;t, will be ful|ly and naturally accounted for.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 10th, about two in the morn|ing, the fog being thick, and the weather calm, and the men very much fatigued, they were ordered to their quarters, to refre&s;h them|&s;elves with &s;leep. It was, be&s;ides, very cold, and much rain fell; and as the wind was va|riable, they could make but little progre&s;s. The ice, in the morning early, &s;eemed rather to clo&s;e upon them, than to divide; and being apprehen&s;ive for their boats, they attempted to hoi&s;t the lances on board, but that belonging to the Carca&s;e, being either too unweildy, or
<PB N="85" REF="452">
the men too much fatigued to effect it, they &s;lung her to the &s;hip's &s;ide.</P>
<P>About eight the breeze &s;prung up fre&s;h from the north-ea&s;t, exceedingly cold, but opening the ice to the we&s;tward. They then made all the &s;ail they could, driving with the loo&s;ening ice, and parting it wherever it was moveable with their whole force. Towards noon they lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>Seven I&s;lands.</HI> And in a very little while after, to their great joy, Spit&s;bergen was &s;een from the ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 11, the men who, with hard labour, cold and watching, were much di&s;pi|rited, on the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy deliverance, and &s;eeing the ice no longer adhere in immove|able bodies, began, after a little refre&s;hment, to re&s;ume their wonted chearfulne&s;s. They had not till the &s;econd clo&s;ing of the ice, after the attempt to dig a pa&s;&s;age through it had proved ineffectual, and that the hauling the lances had been tried with little better &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;co|vered the lea&s;t de&s;pondency. But when they had exerted their utmo&s;t efforts, and Provi|dence, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed to &s;econd their en|deavours, appeared to have for&s;aken them; when their pilots had filled their minds with the terrors of their &s;ituation; and their officers had given the &s;hips and their mo&s;t valuable effects over for lo&s;t, the men then began to re|flect on the hard&s;hips they were likely to &s;uffer, and to be impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of their com|mon
<PB N="86" REF="453">
danger. Their apprehen&s;ions, however, were but temporary, and the moment they were relea&s;ed from their icey pri&s;on, and that they were within &s;ight of a clear &s;ea, their &s;or|row was changed to mirth, and their melan|choly to rejoicing. Fe&s;tivity and jolity took place of ab&s;tinence and gloomy apprehen&s;ions; and before they arrived at Spit&s;bergen, there was not a &s;ailor on board with a &s;erious face.</P>
<P>The ice that had parted from the main body, they had now time to admire. As it no longer ob&s;tructed their cour&s;e, the various &s;hapes in which the broken fragments appeared, were indeed very curious and amu&s;ing. One re|markable piece de&s;cribed a magnificent arch &s;o large and compleatly formed, that a &s;loop of con&s;iderable burden might have &s;ailed through it without lowering her ma&s;t; another repre|&s;ented a church with windows and pillars, and domes; and a third, a table with icicles hang|ing round it like the fringes of a dama&s;k cloth. A fertile imagination might here find enter|tainment enough; for, as has already been ob|&s;erved, the &s;imilitude of all that art or nature has ever yet produced, might here be fancied.</P>
<P>They continued working all this day through the loo&s;e ice. Hacluit's Headland bearing &s;outh thirty-nine we&s;t, and in their cour&s;e &s;aw a Dutch Greenlandman in the &s;outh-we&s;t quarter.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 12th, they cleared the ice, and bore away with all &s;ails &s;et for the harbour of
<PB N="87" REF="454">
Smearingburg, in which they had before ca&s;t anchor. At two in the afternoon they anchor|ed in North Bay, the north part of Vogle Sound bearing north forty-five ea&s;t, di&s;tance about four miles. At half after four the Com|modore made the &s;ignal to weigh; and at half pa&s;t nine, came to an anchor in their former &s;ta|tion, where they found four Dutch Greenland|men lying in readine&s;s to depart. The&s;e Dutch|men acquainted the Commodore, that all the Engli&s;h fi&s;hing &s;hips &s;et &s;ail on the 10th of July, the day to which they are obliged by con|tract, to &s;tay to entitle their owners to receive the bounty-money, allowed by Parliament for the encouragement of that fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the greate&s;t part of the Dutch &s;et &s;ail likewi&s;e from Spit&s;bergen, on their voyage home; but it is a practice with the&s;e la&s;t, to take it by turns to wait till the &s;e|verity of the weather obliges them to leave the coa&s;t, in order to pick up &s;uch men as may by accident have lo&s;t their &s;hips in the ice; and who, notwith&s;tanding, may have had the good fortune to &s;ave their lives by means of their boats. This is a very humane in&s;titution, and does credit to the Dutch Government. Did the Briti&s;h Government bear an equal regard for individuals, &s;o many valuable &s;ubjects would never be &s;uffered to migrate, as now annually hire &s;hips to convey them&s;elves to &s;eek their fortunes in new &s;ettlements. It is e&s;timated,
<PB N="88" REF="455">
that twelve thou&s;and at lea&s;t are yearly &s;hipt off from Ireland, and not many le&s;s from Eng|land and Scotland, yet no mea&s;ures are thought nece&s;&s;ary to be taken to retain them at home.</P>
<P>The turn of waiting at Spit&s;bergen falls an|nually to the lot of about five Dutch &s;hips, who are obliged to &s;end out their boats daily in &s;earch of their unfortunate fellow &s;ubjects; &s;ome of the&s;e boats have them&s;elves &s;uffered &s;everely, and have been detained &s;even or eight days by &s;evere weather in the&s;e excur&s;ions, to the great anxiety of their friends.</P>
<P>The day of our voyagers return to Smearing|burg Harbour being fine, the Commodore or|dered a tent to be rai&s;ed on the lower point to the &s;outh-we&s;t, where there was a level plain for the &s;pace of two miles, and where all the mathematical apparatus were again taken on &s;hore for a &s;econd trial.</P>
<P>They found, on the examination of the vi|bration of the pendulum, that it differed from that at Greenwich by Harri&s;on's time-keeper, only two &s;econds in forty-eight hours; which time-keeper, at their arrival at Greenwich, varied only one &s;econd and a half from the time-pieces at the ob&s;ervatory there. Mr. Robin&s;on, who was articled to Commodore Phipps, from Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital, and who does honour to that noble foundation, was particularly careful to note the re&s;ult of all the ob&s;ervations that were made in this high latitude.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="456" MS="y">The ovens were al&s;o here taken on &s;hore, and a con&s;iderable quantity of good &s;oft bread baked for the refre&s;hment of the men.</P>
<P>Hacluit's Headland, of which mention has been frequently made in the cour&s;e of this voy|age, is an i&s;land on the north-we&s;t point of Spit&s;bergen, about fifteen miles in circumfer|ence, on which is found plenty of &s;curvy-gra&s;s; and in the valleys, &s;ome of which extend from two to three miles, there is &s;tore of other gra&s;s in &s;ummer, on which the deer is &s;uppo&s;ed to feed.</P>
<P>The people were now fully employed in over|hauling the rigging, tarring the &s;hips &s;ides, taking in water, peying and &s;ecuring the ma&s;ts, and in preparing the &s;hips for pur&s;uing their voyage upon di&s;covery; or, if that was found impracticable, for returning home.</P>
<P>On the 16th, two of the Dutch &s;hips weighed anchor, and &s;ailed away in company.</P>
<P>On the 17th, va&s;t pieces of broken ice, &s;up|po&s;ed to have fallen from the Icebergs, came floating into harbour. When the&s;e pieces, which are undermined by the continual agita|tion of the &s;ea in &s;tormy weather, lo&s;e their &s;upport, they tumble with a crack that &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es the loude&s;t thunder; but they were told, that no other thunder was ever heard in this latitude.</P>
<P>The activity and enterprizing &s;pirit of the Ru&s;&s;ians already noticed, begin to manife&s;t it|&s;elf every where, and it is not improbable, but
<PB N="90" REF="457">
that the maritime powers may one day or other have cau&s;e to repent their emulation in con|tributing to aggrandize the naval power of that increa&s;ing people. The dominions of the Ru&s;|&s;ian empire, are &s;ituated to command the trade of the univer&s;e; they are now actually erecting a yard for building &s;hips at Kamp&s;chatka, to improve their di&s;coveries from that quarter, and to open a trade from thence to China. They have attempted to &s;ettle colonies, as our voy|agers were told, on the &s;outhernmo&s;t di&s;tricts of Spit&s;bergen, and tho&s;e of the new &s;ettlers, who &s;urvived the fir&s;t winter, were preparing to encounter the rigour of the climate in a &s;e|cond. This can only be done by way of expe|riment, to try if a &s;ettlement is practicable, for tho&s;e now &s;ent are &s;aid to be criminals.</P>
<P>During the &s;ix days which the &s;hips anchored here to make ob&s;ervations, take in water, re|fre&s;h the men, and refit, our journali&s;t made &s;everal excur&s;ions to the adjoining i&s;lands, where the birds appeared in a&s;toni&s;hing numbers; it being the &s;ea&s;on for bringing forth their young, and teaching them to fly, and to dive.</P>
<P>Of all the birds that breed in the&s;e i&s;lands, the burgerma&s;ter is the large&s;t, and the mo&s;t ravenous; he is &s;o called by the Dutch, from his &s;ize and his authority, as he holds all the other birds in &s;ubjection. His bill is long and crooked, rather like that of the &s;tork, than that of the hawk, and is of a yellow colour.
<PB N="91" REF="458">
He has a red ring about his eyes; is web foot|ed, but has but three claws on each foot. His wings are of a beautiful pearl colour, edged with white; his back a &s;ilver grey; his body white as &s;now, and his tail of the &s;ame colour, which when he flies he &s;preads like a fan. He builds his ne&s;t very high in the rocks, inacce&s;&s;i|ble either to bears or foxes. He preys upon all the other birds, and eats the carrion of fi&s;h or fle&s;h, or whatever comes in his way. His cry is horrible, and when he &s;creams, the mal|lemuch, a bird as large as a duck, is &s;o much intimidated, that &s;he will &s;ink down, and &s;uffer him to devour her without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Our journali&s;t found it very dangerous to pur&s;ue his way over the hills and precipices in this rugged country. The clefts on the moun|tains are like tho&s;e in the ice frequently impa&s;|&s;able; but they are abundantly more hazar|dous, being &s;ometimes concealed under the &s;now, &s;o that a traveller is engulphed before he is aware. Many have been entombed in the&s;e clefts, and peri&s;hed in the hearing of their compa|nions, without a po&s;&s;ibility of relief. To a contemplative mind, however, even the defor|mities of nature, are not unplea&s;ing, the wi&s;|dom of the Creator being manife&s;t in all his works.</P>
<P>On the 19th of Augu&s;t the &s;hips unmoored, and on the twentieth they cleared the harbour. They found the tide to flow north-ea&s;t and
<PB N="92" REF="459">
&s;outh-we&s;t, and to ri&s;e three feet &s;even inches perpendicular height.</P>
<P>On the 22d they again found them&s;elves be|&s;et with loo&s;e ice. They were then in latitude 80 degrees 14 minutes north, longitude 5 de|grees 44 minutes ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 22d they had a heavy &s;ea from the &s;outh-we&s;t quarter.</P>
<P>On the 23d the Carca&s;e, being a heavier &s;ailer than the Race Hor&s;e, lo&s;t &s;ight of the Commodore, and fired a &s;ix-pounder, which was an&s;wered. In the evening they came in &s;ight, and pur&s;ued their cour&s;e with favourable weather, and without any thing worthy of no|tice happening till</P>
<P>September 5, when, being clear and calm weather, the Commodore &s;ounded, and found ground with &s;even hundred fathoms, very &s;oft mud. The people were employed eight hours in heaving up the lead with the cap&s;tan. At three in the morning the &s;un ri&s;en, took the ampli|tude, and found the variation to be 22 degrees 53 minutes we&s;t.</P>
<P>September 7, at five in the afternoon, they had heavy &s;qualls, with rain; at &s;even in the morning moderate weather. This day, in 60 degrees 15 minutes we&s;t, they found their lon|gitude, corrected by ob&s;ervation of &s;un and moon, to be 5 degrees 59 minutes ea&s;t. Lon|gitude by time keeper 4 degrees 45 minutes ea&s;t; a very remarkable difference.</P>

<P>Sept. 11, when, at half after ten, the night dark, and the weather moderate, the wind all at once veered to the &s;outhward, and a &s;trong gale with a great &s;ea came on. The &s;hips parted, and never more came in &s;ight till they met off Harwich, on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Our journali&s;t being on board the Carca&s;e, can now only relate what happened to that &s;loop, till her arrival in the River Thames.</P>
<P>When the gale came on, the Commodore's lights not appearing, the Carca&s;e fired a &s;ix-pounder, but that &s;hot not being returned by the Race Hor&s;e, it was concluded, that the Commodore was at too great a di&s;tance to hear the &s;ignal. At four in the morning the gale in|crea&s;ing, they clo&s;e reefed the top-&s;ails, and employed all hands in la&s;hing and &s;ecuring the boats and booms, and preparing to with&s;tand the threatening &s;torm.

Shipped &s;uch heavy &s;eas, wa&s;hed all the provi&s;i|ons and ca&s;ks that were la&s;hed on the deck, over board; kept two pumps continually go|ing; obliged to &s;kuttle the boats, to prevent their being wa&s;hed over-board.

<P>Thus ended a voyage, which &s;eems to have determined the que&s;tion &s;o much agitated con|cerning the navigation to the north pole, and proved what Captain Wood had before a&s;&s;erted, that no pa&s;&s;age would ever be found practicable in that direction.</P>
<P>From the quantities of ice which that naviga|tor met with in latitude 76 north, longitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ea&s;t, he concluded indeed erroneou&s;ly, that
<PB N="102" REF="473">
the 80th degree would bound the pa&s;&s;age to|wards the poles, and that from thence the polar region was either a continued continent of &s;olid ice, or that land filled up the intermediate &s;pace.</P>
<P>It has been found, however, that tho&s;e &s;eas are navigable as far as between the eighty-fir&s;t and eighty-&s;econd degrees of latitude; and it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, that in &s;ome future years, they may be found navigable a degree or two farther: but it may now with certainty be con|cluded, that a cour&s;e under the pole can never be pur&s;ued for the purpo&s;e of commerce.</P>
<P>We have already &s;hewn inconte&s;tibly, that the north &s;ea communicates with the ea&s;tern &s;ea, and that the pa&s;&s;age to China and Japan may be performed with difficulty by a north-ea&s;t cour&s;e, by watching the opportunity, when a few days in the year the north &s;ea is open. But who would think of expo&s;ing a &s;hip's com|pany to the hazard of being frozen to death in a tedious, uncertain, and dangerous pa&s;&s;age, when a &s;afe, certain, and, one may &s;ay, &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age at all times lies open before them.</P>
<P>From Behring's di&s;coveries to the ea&s;t of Ja|pan, and from the continent he there met with, there &s;eems rea&s;on to believe, that the land &s;een by Commodore Phipps to the ea&s;tward of the Se|ven I&s;lands, might be a continuation of that con|tinent. In that ca&s;e it is not improbable, but that either that continent may join to the we&s;tern part of America, or that it may extend &s;outh|ward,
<PB N="103" REF="474">
and form a part of that continent &s;o much &s;ought after in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>A &s;mall premium of two or three thou&s;and pounds &s;ecured by Parliament, to be paid to the owner or owners of any Greenland fi&s;hing &s;hip, that &s;hould be fortunate enough to di&s;co|ver &s;uch a continent to the ea&s;tward or north|ward of the <HI>Seven I&s;lands,</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly have a better effect, than many expen&s;ive expeditions fitted out &s;olely for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch di&s;co|very. This, by a trading nation, were it only to improve the &s;cience of geography, would &s;urely be well be&s;towed.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, that the reward &s;ecured by parliament for the di&s;covery of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, has not yet been attended with that &s;uc|ce&s;s, with which the promoters of the bill had flattered them&s;elves and the public, from the li|bera i&s;pirit with which it was granted.</P>
<P>The Hud&s;on's Bay Company, though bound by their charter to further and promote the di&s;|covery, were generally &s;u&s;pected, from intere&s;ted motives, to oppo&s;e and di&s;courage every at|tempt to accompli&s;h it. And Captain Mid|dleton, who in 1740 was &s;ent in a king's &s;hip upon that &s;ervice, returning without &s;ucce&s;s, was publicly charged with having received a bribe of five thou&s;and pounds to defeat the undertaking, and by his report to di&s;courage any farther attempts in pur&s;uit of it. This charge was &s;trongly &s;upported, and generally
<PB N="104" REF="475">
credited. And Mr. Dobbs, by who&s;e intere&s;t Captain Middleton was employed, had the ad|dre&s;s to prevail with the then mini&s;try, to pre|clude any future &s;cheme of private corruption, by promoting the public reward already men|tioned.</P>
<P>The preamble to the act will &s;tate this mat|ter in the true light it &s;ets forth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas the di&s;covery of a north-we&s;t pa&s;|&s;age through Hud&s;on's Streight to the we&s;tern ocean would be of great benefit and advan|tage to this kingdom, and that it would be of great advantage to the adventurers to at|tempt the &s;ame, if a public reward was given to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould make a perfect di&s;|covery of the &s;aid pa&s;&s;age; it is therefore enacted, that if any &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els belong|ing to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects &s;hall find out and &s;ail through any pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea between Hud&s;on's bay and the we&s;tern ocean of Ame|rica, the owners of &s;uch &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be entitled to receive as a reward for &s;uch di&s;covery the &s;um of TWENTY-THOUSAND POUNDS."</Q> And as a farther encouragement to pro&s;ecute this di&s;covery, and to prevent ob|&s;tructions from intere&s;ted per&s;ons, it was e|nacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that all per&s;ons, &s;ubjects of his Ma|je&s;ty, re&s;iding in any place where the &s;aid adventurers may come in the pro&s;ecution of this di&s;covery, &s;hall give the &s;aid adventu|rers all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;hall no way ob&s;truct,
<PB N="105" REF="476">
mole&s;t, or refu&s;e the &s;aid adventurers rea&s;on|able &s;uccour in any di&s;tre&s;s they may fall into in the pro&s;ecution of this di&s;covery."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the encouragement, and &s;uch the liberal reward that was and is &s;ecured by par|liament to the fortunate di&s;coverers of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the great pacific ocean; a pa&s;|&s;age which, it is generally believed, would open a trade with nations on the northern continent of America, wholly unknown to the maritime powers of Europe, and &s;uppo&s;ed, from their &s;ituation, to abound in commodities equally rare and precious with tho&s;e of any other coun|try under the &s;un.</P>
<P>The fair pro&s;pect of acquiring fame by en|larging commerce, the hope of obtaining the parliamentary reward, and the de&s;ire of ex|po&s;ing the di&s;-ingenuity of Captain Middleton, were incitements &s;ufficient to prevail with Mr. Dobbs to &s;ollicit the equipment of two &s;hips for another voyage, which he made not the lea&s;t doubt would find out the pa&s;&s;age &s;o long &s;ought for in vain, and by the advantages at|tending the di&s;covery, exceed the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the adventurers.</P>
<P>The command of this expedition was given to Captain Ellis, who, on the 31&s;t of May, 1746, pa&s;&s;ed Yarmouth in the Dobb's Galley, accom|panied by the California Sloop, and convoyed to the north &s;ea by the Loo man of war. But in proportion as Mr. Dobbs had flat|tered the avarice of the adventurers who were to &s;hare in the reward, and had elated him&s;elf with the thoughts of triumphing over the di&s;|grace of Captain Middleton, &s;o it happened, that when the &s;hips returned without having effected any one thing of con&s;equence, the cha|grin of the former for having advanced their
<PB N="106" REF="477">
money on a vi&s;ionary project, and the mortifi|cation of the latter in not being able to &s;up|port his charge, were increa&s;ed by every cir|cum&s;tance that could aggravate the di&s;appoint|ment. Captain Middleton now triumphed in his turn, and no &s;hip from England has &s;ince been induced to undertake the voyage, not|with&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of the reward.</P>
<P>It is now, however, believed, that Govern|ment have in contemplation another voyage to the north, to which that of Captain Phipps was only the prelude; but there is rea&s;on to conclude, from what has already been &s;aid of the&s;e latter attempts, and from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of former undertakings, that the di&s;covery of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age is not the &s;ole object in view. The figure of the earth, the phenomena of the winds, the variation of the compa&s;s, and the attraction of the magnet, are points yet un&s;ettled, of infinite importance to navigation; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that a more careful examination of the polar regions may lead to the &s;olution of problems, that have hitherto baffled the enquiries of the able&s;t navigators.</P>
<P>A very &s;lender acquaintance with the difficul|ties and hard&s;hips attending northern di&s;cove|ries, will fully account for our knowledge of the countries &s;urrounding the pole being &s;till very imperfect. A brief recapitulation of the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e to whom we are mo&s;t indebted for our information, will not, we hope, be thought an improper conclu&s;ion to a voyage &s;olely undertaken with a view to enlarge it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who conceived the idea of exploring the northern regions was Seba&s;tian Cabbot. That enterprizing navigator, long before Ma|gellan thought of a pa&s;&s;age to the pacific ocean
<PB N="107" REF="478">
by the &s;outh-we&s;t, had made two voyages, with a view to direct his cour&s;e to the &s;ame &s;ea by the north-we&s;t. In the&s;e voyages, he di&s;co|vered Newfoundland, the coa&s;t of the E&s;qui|meaux Indians, and had penetrated as far as the 64th degree of latitude, when a mutiny among his men, or rather an ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to pro|ceed any further, obliged him to return; yet he died in the per&s;ua&s;ion that a pa&s;&s;age in that direction certainly exi&s;ted, and that he &s;hould have found it but for the oppo&s;ition of his crew.</P>
<P>The next, who, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame notion, undertook a voyage for di&s;coveries to|wards the north, was Sir Martin Forbi&s;her. He di&s;covered Greenland, and in the latitude of 62 deg. north, pa&s;&s;ed a &s;treight, which, though it &s;till holds a place in our maps, has never been found navigable &s;ince. He made two other voyages, di&s;covered many bays and capes, to which he gave names, but returned without attaining the principal object of his voyage, though, like his predece&s;&s;or, he a&s;|&s;erted the certainty of its exi&s;tence to his late&s;t hour.</P>
<P>To him &s;ucceeded Sir Humphry Gilbert, who in 1583 traver&s;ed the coa&s;t of Labradore, entered the mouth of the great river St. Lau|rence, and, &s;urrounding the i&s;land of Newfound|land, laid the foundation of the cod fi&s;hery, which has been pro&s;ecuted with immen&s;e ad|vantage to his country ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The rapid progre&s;s of di&s;coveries in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, which about this time were attended with va&s;t profit to the adventu|rers, re-animated cotemporary navigators to pro&s;ecute, with more ardour than ever, their enterprizes towards the north. The more the
<PB N="108" REF="479">
pacific ocean became known, the firmer the belief prevailed, that a pa&s;&s;age into it by way of the north mu&s;t certainly exi&s;t, and that who|ever could di&s;cover it, would not only immor|talize his name, but enrich his country.</P>
<P>The merchants of that time were no le&s;s eager to embark their money, than the naviga|tors were to hazard their per&s;ons in any new project, where the hope of gain appeared to be well founded. A company therefore of wealthy per&s;ons in London agreed to join a company of merchants in the we&s;t, and to &s;it out two &s;hips for the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age, which all agreed was practicable, though none could tell readily where to find it. To the command of this expedition Captain John Da|vis was &s;trongly recommended as an able navi|gator, and of a bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit. Accordingly, on the 7th of June, 1685, he &s;et &s;ail from Dartmouth, in the Sun-&s;hine of fifty tons, and accompanied by the moon-&s;hine of thirty-five tons, having on board both ve&s;&s;els forty-two hardy &s;eamen. On the 19th of July they were alarmed by a mighty roaring, which was the more terrible, as the fog was &s;o thick, that they could not &s;ee each other at a &s;hip's length. It proved only the crackling of the i&s;lands of ice, which was not then very well under&s;tood. On the breaking up of the fog they di&s;covered land, which, from its horrid appearance, they named <HI>the land of de&s;olation.</HI> On the 24th they were in 64 deg. 15 min. north, the &s;ea open and the weather moderate. In this latitude they di&s;covered land, and con|ver&s;ed with the natives, who appeared to be a harmle&s;s ho&s;pitable people, polite in their man|ners, neatly habited, and not ill favoured. The&s;e friendly people, ob&s;erving that the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="109" REF="480">
admired their furs, went up in the country to bring down more, with which they traded with much &s;implicity. To an adjoining hill Davis gave the name of Mount Raleigh, from which he took his departure on the 8th of Au|gu&s;t, and on the 11th doubled the &s;outhernmo&s;t cape in view, to which he gave the name of the <HI>Cape of God's Mercy,</HI> and entered a &s;treight, which bears the name of the Di&s;coverer to this day. In this &s;treight he &s;ailed &s;ixty leagues, and on the 14th went on &s;hore, and found evident &s;igns of human inhabitants, being met by a pack of dogs (twenty in number) that ex|pre&s;&s;ed their joy, as if their ma&s;ters had been re|turned after an interval of ab&s;ence. One of tho&s;e had on a leathern collar. The Captain was highly plea&s;ed with the promi&s;ing appear|ance of the new &s;treights, and con&s;ulting with the ma&s;ter, agreed to report, upon their return home, that they had found the wi&s;hed-for pa&s;|&s;age to the we&s;tern &s;ea.</P>
<P>The weather changing from temperate to ex|ce&s;&s;ive cold, on the 20th it was re&s;olved to &s;et &s;ail for England. On the 12th of September they fell in with the land of De&s;olation, and on the 30th of the &s;ame month entered the port of Dartmouth, without the lo&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>The account Captain Davis gave to his owners was &s;o well received, that other mer|chants were de&s;irous of joining in a &s;econd expedition, and accordingly he was again em|ployed, and furni&s;hed with a much greater force.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May he &s;ailed from Dart|mouth in the Mermaid, of 120 tons, in com|pany with the Sun-&s;hine and Moon-&s;hine as be|fore, and an additional pinnace of thirteen tons, called the North Star.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="481">In the latitude of 60 degrees north Captain Davis divided his force, ordering the Sun-&s;hine and North Star to &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age between Green|land and Iceland, while the Mermaid and Moon-&s;hine continued their cour&s;e to the &s;treight as before. In the latitude of 64 degrees, and longitude 58 deg. 30 min. north from London, they fell again in with the land, and met the &s;ame people with whom they had traded the former year. Overjoyed to meet, they re|newed their acquaintance, and while the Eng|li&s;h was preparing a pinnace to facilitate their di&s;coveries, the natives came in numbers to carry on trade. As &s;oon as the pinnace was fitted for &s;ea, Captain Davis di&s;patched her to examine the inlets on the coa&s;t, and to trace their cour&s;e up the main land; but that was productive of no e&s;&s;ential di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Though the natives attended them with an ob&s;equious diligence, yet on their kindling a fire in their manner, and u&s;ing &s;ome &s;trange cere|monies, Captain Davis &s;uppo&s;ing them to be u&s;ing idolatrous &s;orceries, fir&s;t thru&s;t the prie&s;t into the &s;moke, and then encouraged his men to tread out the flame, and to &s;purn the reeking coals into the &s;ea. Unable to bear the in&s;ult, the natives for the fir&s;t time began to &s;hew re|&s;entment. They &s;eized the boat from the &s;tern of the Moon-&s;hine, cut the cable belonging to the Mermaid, made prize of the implements that lay upon the &s;hore, and, in &s;hort, declared open ho&s;tilities again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ors, who in return di&s;charged their artillery among them, which in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed them.</P>
<P>No civilities, however, that could be &s;hewn them, after the indignity offered to their prie&s;t, could ever after reconcile them, and the year following they found an opportunity to take a
<PB N="111" REF="482">
&s;evere revenge. In the mean time one of them being made pri&s;oner, was taken on board the Mermaid; who, after recovering his fright, trimmed up his darts, repaired his fi&s;hing tackle, picked okam, and &s;et his hand to any thing he was &s;et about; and, after a time, became a very plea&s;ant companion on board.</P>
<P>On the 17th of July, in latitude 63 degrees 8 min. north, they fell in with a continent of ice, very high, like land, with bays and capes, and, till they examined it clo&s;ely, could not be convinced that it was a mere congelation. They coa&s;ted it till the 30th, when the weather became &s;o tempe&s;tuous and foggy, and withal &s;o cold, that the &s;hrouds, ropes, and &s;ails were frozen and glazed with ice; and the men, who the year before found the &s;ea open and the wea|ther temperate, became &s;o di&s;pirited, that in an orderly manner they addre&s;&s;ed their Com|mander, and intreated him to con&s;ider their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to have regard to his own life, and the pre&s;ervation of theirs; and not, through boldne&s;s and an indi&s;creet zeal for a hopele&s;s di&s;covery, leave their widows and fa|therle&s;s children to blacken his memory with bitter cur&s;es. Moved with their pitiable re|pre&s;entation, he di&s;charged the Mermaid with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t de&s;irous of returning home, and proceeded in the Moon&s;hine to pro|&s;ecute his voyage. Changing his cour&s;e to reco|ver the oppo&s;ite &s;hore on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, in latitude 66 deg. 33 min. north, and longitude 70 degrees we&s;t, he di&s;covered land, without either ice or &s;now. On the 2d they ca&s;t an|chor in a fine road, and in a day or two were vi|&s;ited by the natives, who came to traffic. On the 14th they &s;et &s;ail to the we&s;tward, and on the 16th changed their cour&s;e to the &s;outhward.
<PB N="112" REF="483">
On the 18th they di&s;covered a high promontory to the north-we&s;t, which having no land to the &s;outh, recovered their hopes of a free pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>On doubling the Cape, they found the land trending away to the &s;outh in broken i&s;lands, and coa&s;ting along till they arrived at a fine opening, in latitude 57 degrees, they &s;ailed ten leagues, with woods and lawns on each &s;ide, abounding with deer and game of every kind.

<P>On the 6th, returning to their former &s;ta|tion, five of the crew fell into an ambu&s;cade; for having ventured on &s;hore unarmed in their boat, they were &s;uddenly a&s;&s;aulted from the woods, two of them killed upon the &s;pot, two grievou&s;ly wounded, and the fifth made his e&s;cape by &s;wimming, with an arrow &s;ticking in his arm.

<P>About the beginning of October they arrived at Dartmouth, where they found the Sun&s;hine, but the North Star having parted company in a hard gale on the coa&s;t of Greenland, was never more heard of.</P>
