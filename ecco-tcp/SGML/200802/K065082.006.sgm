<P>DURING a long and di&s;graceful reign of of twenty-eight years, Honorius, emperor of the We&s;t, was &s;eparated from the friend&s;hip <NOTE PLACE="marg">La&s;t years and death of Hono|rius, A.

The &s;trange adventures of Placidia <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Chap. xxxi.</NOTE> gradually renewed, and cemented, the alliance of the two empires. The daughter
<PB N="2" REF="11">
of the great Theodo&s;ius had been the captive and the queen of the Goths: &s;he lo&s;t an affec|tionate hu&s;band; &s;he was dragged in chains by his in&s;ulting a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; &s;he ta&s;ted the plea&s;ure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty of peace, for &s;ix hundred thou&s;and mea&s;ures of wheat. After her return from Spain to Italy, Placidia experienced a new per&s;ecution in the bo&s;om of her family. She was aver&s;e to a mar|riage, which had been &s;tipulated without her con&s;ent; and the brave Con&s;tantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanqui&s;hed, received, from the hand of Honorius him&s;elf, the &s;truggling and reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus. But her re&s;i&s;tance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials; nor did Placidia refu&s;e to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian the third, or to a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e an ab&s;olute dominion over the mind of her grateful hu&s;band. The generous &s;oldier, who&s;e time had hitherto been divided between &s;ocial plea&s;ure and military &s;ervice, was taught new le&s;&s;ons of avarice and ambition: he extorted the title of Augu&s;tus; and the &s;ervant of Honorius was a&s;&s;ociated to the empire of the We&s;t. The death of Con&s;tantius, in the &s;eventh month of his reign, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, &s;eemed to increa&s;e, the power of Placidia; and the indecent familiarity <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, is the expre&s;&s;ion of Olympiodorus (apud Photium, p. 197.); who means, perhaps, to de&s;cribe the &s;ame care&s;&s;es which Mahomet be&s;towed on his <HI>daughter</HI> Phatemah. Quando (&s;ays the prophet him&s;elf), quando &s;ubit mihi de&s;iderium Paradi&s;i, o&s;culor cam, et ingero linguam meam in os ejus. But this &s;en&s;ual indulgence was ju&s;tified by miracle and my&s;tery; and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Fa|ther Maracci, in his Ver&s;ion and Confutation of the Koran, tom. i. p. 32.</NOTE> of her

brother, which might be no more than the &s;ymp|toms of a childi&s;h affection, were univer&s;ally attributed to ince&s;tuous love. On a &s;udden, by &s;ome ba&s;e intrigues of a &s;teward and a nur&s;e, this exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s was converted into an irrecon|cileable quarrel: the debates of the emperor and his &s;i&s;ter were not long confined within the walls of the palace; and as the Gothic &s;oldiers adhered to their queen, the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults, which could only be appea&s;ed by the forced or voluntary re|treat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles landed at Con&s;tantinople, &s;oon after the marriage of Theodo&s;ius, during the fe&s;tival of the Per&s;ian victories. They were treated with kindne&s;s and magnificence; but as the &s;tatues of the emperor Con&s;tantius had been rejected by the Ea&s;tern court, the title of Augu&s;ta could not de|cently be allowed to his widow. Within a few months after the arrival of Placidia, a &s;wift me&s;|&s;enger announced the death of Honorius, the con&s;equence of a drop&s;y; but the important &s;ecret was not divulged, till the nece&s;&s;ary orders had been di&s;patched for the march of a large body of troops to the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Dalmatia. The &s;hops and the gates of Con&s;tantinople remained &s;hut during &s;even days; and the lo&s;s of a foreign prince, who could neither be e&s;teemed nor re|gretted,

A temperate enquiry into the real motives of Boniface, would have re&s;tored a faith|ful &s;ervant to his duty and to the republic; but the arts of Aetius &s;till continued to betray and to inflame, and the count was urged, by per|&s;ecution, to embrace the mo&s;t de&s;perate coun&s;els.

<P>The long and narrow tract of the African coa&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;olation of Africa.</NOTE> was filled with frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence; and the re&s;pective degrees of improvement might be accurately mea&s;ured by the di&s;tance from Carthage and the Mediter|ranean.

On a &s;udden, the &s;even fruitful provinces, from Tangier to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by the inva&s;ion of the Vandals; who&s;e de&s;tructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular ani|mo&s;ity, religious zeal, and extravagant declama|tion.

Their victorious hords had &s;pread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public force was exhau&s;ted by the di&s;cord of independent chief|tains; their valour was idly con&s;umed in ob&s;cure and predatory excur&s;ions; and they often de|graded their national dignity by conde&s;cending, for the hopes of &s;poil, to enli&s;t under the ban|ners of their fugitive enemies.

<P>In the tide of emigration, which impetuou&s;ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in modern Hungary.</NOTE> rolled from the confines of China to tho&s;e of Germany, the mo&s;t powerful and populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces.

The Hunga|rians, who ambitiou&s;ly in&s;ert the name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth, that the hords, which were &s;ubject to his uncle Roas, or Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">Hungary has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively occupied by three Scythian colo|nies. 1.

peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans of the We&s;t was cemented by his per&s;onal friend&s;hip for the great Aetius; who was always &s;ecure of finding, in the Barbarian camp, a ho&s;pitable reception, and a powerful &s;upport.

The kings of the Huns a&s;&s;umed the &s;olid benefits, as well as the vain honours, of the negociation.

Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they lo&s;t the great|e&s;t part of their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with &s;ome knowledge of the country, and an impatient de&s;ire of revenge. In the free conver&s;ation of the Imperial amba&s;|&s;adors, who di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, at the court of Attila, the character and de&s;igns of their formidable enemy, the mini&s;ters of Con&s;tantinople expre&s;&s;ed their hope, that his &s;trength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful conte&s;t with the princes of the hou&s;e of Sa&s;&s;an.

The public danger and di&s;tre&s;s could not, however, provoke Theodo&s;ius to interrupt his amu&s;ements and devotion, or to appear in per&s;on at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been &s;ent again&s;t Gen&s;eric, were ha&s;tily recalled from Sicily; the garri&s;ons, on the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, were exhau&s;ted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formid|able by their arms and numbers, if the generals had under&s;tood the &s;cience of command, and their &s;oldiers the duty of obedience. The ar|mies of the Ea&s;tern empire were vanqui&s;hed in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive engagements; and the progre&s;s of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle.

The firmne&s;s of a Chine&s;e mandarin <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">He repre&s;ented, to the emperor of the Moguls, that the four provinces (Petcheli, Chantong, Chan&s;i, and Leaotong) which he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, might annually produce, under a mild admini&s;tra|tion, 500,000 ounces of &s;ilver, 400,000 mea&s;ures of rice, and 800,000 pieces of &s;ilk.

The &s;econd cla&s;s, compo&s;ed of the young and beautiful wo|men, of the artificers of every rank and profe&s;|&s;ion, and of the more wealthy or honourable citizens, from whom a private ran&s;om might be expected, was di&s;tributed in equal or proportion|able lots. The remainder, who&s;e life or death was alike u&s;ele&s;s to the conquerors, were per|mitted to return to the city; which, in the mean while, had been &s;tripped of its valuable furniture; and a tax was impo&s;ed on tho&s;e wretched inha|bitants for the indulgence of breathing their na|tive air.

II. The king of the Huns required, and obtained, that his tribute or &s;ub&s;idy &s;hould be augmented from &s;even hundred pounds of gold to the annual &s;um of two thou|&s;and one hundred; and he &s;tipulated the imme|diate payment of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds of gold to defray the expences, or to expiate the guilt, of the war.

channels, to the trea&s;ury of Con&s;tantinople. The revenue was di&s;&s;ipated by Theodo&s;ius, and his favourites, in wa&s;teful and profu&s;e luxury; which was di&s;gui&s;ed by the names of Imperial magni|ficence, or Chri&s;tian charity. The immediate &s;upplies had been exhau&s;ted by the unfore&s;een nece&s;&s;ity of military preparations. A per&s;onal contribution, rigorou&s;ly, but capriciou&s;ly, im|po&s;ed on the members of the &s;enatorian order, was the only expedient that could di&s;arm, with|out lo&s;s of time, the impatient avarice of At|tila: and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the &s;candalous re&s;ource of expo&s;ing to public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">According to the de&s;cription, or rather invective, of Chry&s;o&s;|tom, an auction of Byzantine luxury mu&s;t have been very produc|tive.

III.

From this principle he concluded, and the conclu&s;ions of Attila were irrevocable laws, that the Huns, who had been taken pri&s;oners in war, &s;hould be relea&s;ed with|out delay, and without ran&s;om; that every Ro|man captive, who had pre&s;umed to e&s;cape, &s;hould purcha&s;e his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the Barba|rians,

For the&s;e importunate and oppre&s;&s;ive emba&s;&s;ies, At|tila claimed a &s;uitable return: he weighed, with &s;u&s;picious pride, the character and &s;tation of the Imperial envoys; but he conde&s;cended to pro|mi&s;e, that he would advance as far as Sardica, to receive any mini&s;ters who had been inve&s;ted with the con&s;ular dignity. The council of Theodo&s;ius eluded this propo&s;al, by repre&s;enting the de&s;olate and ruined condition of Sardica; and even ven|tured to in&s;inuate, that every officer of the army or hou&s;ehold was qualified to treat with the mo&s;t powerful princes of Scythia. Maximin <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">In the Per&s;ian treaty concluded in the year 422, the wi&s;e and eloquent Maximin had been the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Ardaburius (Socrates, l. vii. c. 20.).

The two la&s;t amba&s;&s;adors of the Huns, Ore&s;tes, a noble &s;ub|ject of the Pannonian province, and Edecon, a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, re|turned at the &s;ame time from Con&s;tantinople to the royal camp. Their ob&s;cure names were after|wards illu&s;trated by the extraordinary fortune and the contra&s;t of their &s;ons: the two &s;ervants of Attila became the fathers of the la&s;t Roman em|peror of the We&s;t, and of the fir&s;t Barbarian king of Italy.</P>
<P>The amba&s;&s;adors, who were followed by a nu|merous <NOTE PLACE="marg">The em|ba&s;&s;y of Maximin to Attila, A.

As the remains of Sardica were &s;till included within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans to exerci&s;e the duties of ho&s;pitality. They provided, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the provincials, a &s;ufficient number of &s;heep and oxen; and invited the Huns to a &s;plendid, or at lea&s;t, a plentiful, &s;upper. But the harmony of the entertainment was &s;oon di&s;turbed by mutual prejudice and indi&s;cretion. The great|ne&s;s of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their mini&s;ters; the Huns, with equal ardour, a&s;&s;erted the &s;uperiority of their victorious monarch: the di&s;pute was inflamed by the ra&s;h and un&s;ea&s;onable flattery of Vigilius, who pa&s;&s;ionately rejected the compari&s;on of a mere mortal with the divine Theodo&s;ius; and it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Pri&s;cus
<PB N="69" REF="78">
were able to divert the conver&s;ation, or to &s;oothe the angry minds of the Barbarians. When they ro&s;e from table, the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador pre|&s;ented Edecon and Ore&s;tes with rich gifts of &s;ilk robes and Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Ore&s;tes could not forbear in&s;i|nuating, that <HI>he</HI> had not always been treated with &s;uch re&s;pect and liberality: and the offen&s;ive di&s;|tinction, which was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague, &s;eems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and Ore&s;tes an irreconcileable enemy. After this entertainment, they travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Nai&s;&s;us. That flouri&s;hing city, which had given birth to the great Con&s;tan|tine, was levelled with the ground: the inhabit|ants were de&s;troyed, or di&s;per&s;ed; and the ap|pearance of &s;ome &s;ick per&s;ons, who were &s;till per|mitted to exi&s;t among the ruins of the churches, &s;erved only to increa&s;e the horror of the pro&s;pect. The &s;urface of the country was covered with the bones of the &s;lain; and the amba&s;&s;adors, who directed their cour&s;e to the north-we&s;t, were obliged to pa&s;s the hills of modern Servia, be|fore they de&s;cended into the flat and mar&s;hy grounds, which are terminated by the Danube. The Huns were ma&s;ters of the great river: their navigation was performed in large canoes, hol|lowed out of the trunk of a &s;ingle tree; the mi|ni&s;ters of Theodo&s;ius were &s;afely landed on the oppo&s;ite bank; and their Barbarian a&s;&s;ociates im|mediately ha&s;tened to the camp of Attila, which was equally prepared for the amu&s;ements of

hunting, or of war. No &s;ooner had Maximin advanced about two miles from the Danube, than he began to experience the fa&s;tidious in&s;o|lence of the conqueror. He was &s;ternly forbid to pitch his tents in a plea&s;ant valley, le&s;t he &s;hould infringe the di&s;tant awe that was due to the royal man&s;ion. The mini&s;ters of Attila pre&s;&s;ed him to communicate the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the in&s;truc|tions, which he re&s;erved for the ear of their &s;ove|reign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations, he was &s;till more confounded to find, that the re&s;olutions of the Sacred Con&s;i&s;tory, tho&s;e &s;ecrets (&s;ays Pri&s;cus) which &s;hould not be revealed to the gods them|&s;elves, had been treacherou&s;ly di&s;clo&s;ed to the public enemy. On his refu&s;al to comply with &s;uch ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was commanded in&s;tantly to depart: the order was recalled; it was again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to &s;ubdue the patient firmne&s;s of Maximin. At length, by the interce&s;&s;ion of Scotta, the brother of Onege&s;ius, who&s;e friend&s;hip had been purcha&s;ed by a liberal gift, he was admitted to the royal pre&s;ence; but, in&s;tead of obtaining a deci&s;ive an&s;wer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey to|wards the North, that Attila might enjoy the proud &s;atisfaction of receiving, in the &s;ame camp, the amba&s;&s;adors of the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern em|pires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who obliged him to halt, to ha&s;ten his march, or to deviate from the common road, as it be&s;t &s;uit|ed

From the conti|guous villages they received a plentiful and re|gular &s;upply of provi&s;ions; mead in&s;tead of wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named <HI>camus,</HI> which, according to the report of Pri&s;cus, was di&s;tilled from barley <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">The Huns them&s;elves &s;till continued to de&s;pi&s;e the labours of agriculture: they abu&s;ed the privilege of a victorious nation; and the Goths, their indu&s;trious &s;ubjects who cultivated the earth, dread|ed their neighbourhood, like that of &s;o many ravenous wolves (Pri&s;|cus, p. 45.).

The &s;un&s;hine of the &s;ucceeding day was dedicated to repo&s;e; to collect and dry the baggage, and to the refre&s;h|ment of the men and hor&s;es: but, in the even|ing, before they pur&s;ued their journey, the am|ba&s;&s;adors expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude to the bounte|ous lady of the village, by a very acceptable pre|&s;ent of &s;ilver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march of Attila, from whom they had been &s;eparated about &s;ix days; and &s;lowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not contain, in the &s;pace of &s;everal thou&s;and miles, a &s;ingle city.</P>
<P>As far as we may a&s;certain the vague and ob|&s;cure <NOTE PLACE="marg">The royal village and palace.</NOTE> geography of Pri&s;cus, this capital appears to have been &s;eated between the Danube, the Tey&s;s, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of Upper Hungary, and mo&s;t probably in the neigh|bourhood of Jazberin, Agria, or Tokay <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">It is evident, that Pri&s;cus pa&s;&s;ed the Danube and the Tey&s;s, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian hills.

its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent re&s;idence of Attila, had in&s;en&s;ibly &s;welled into a huge vil|lage, for the reception of his court, of the troops who followed his per&s;on, and of the various mul|titude of idle or indu&s;trious &s;laves and retainers <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The royal village of Attila may be compared to the city of Karacorum, the re&s;idence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Zingis; which, though it appears to have been a more &s;table habitation, did not equal the &s;ize or &s;plendor of the town and abbey of St. Denys; in the 13th cen|tury (&s;ee Rubruquis, in the Hi&s;torie Generale des Voyages, tom. vii. p. 286.). The camp of Aurengzebe, as it is &s;o agreeably de&s;cribed by Bernier (tom. ii. p. 217&mdash;235.), blended the manners of Scythia with the magnificence and luxury of Hindo&s;tan.</NOTE>. The baths, con&s;tructed by Onege&s;ius, were the only edifice of &s;tone; the materials had been tran&s;ported from Pannonia; and &s;ince the adja|cent country was de&s;titute even of large timber, it may be pre&s;umed, that the meaner habitations of the royal village con&s;i&s;ted of &s;traw, of mud, or of canvas. The wooden hou&s;es of the more illu&s;trious Huns, were built and adorned with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or the ta&s;te of the proprietors. They &s;eem to have been di&s;tributed with &s;ome degree of order and &s;ymmetry; and each &s;pot became more honourable, as it approached the per&s;on of the &s;overeign. The palace of Attila, which &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed all other hou&s;es in his dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample &s;pace of ground. The outward enclo&s;ure was a lofty wall, or palli&s;ade, of &s;mooth &s;quare timber, inter&s;ected with high towers, but intended rather for orna|ment than defence. This wall, which &s;eems to
<PB N="74" REF="83">
have encircled the declivity of a hill, compre|hended a great variety of wooden edifices, adapt|ed to the u&s;es of royalty. A &s;eparate hou&s;e was a&s;&s;igned to each of the numerous wives of Attila; and, in&s;tead of the rigid and illiberal confine|ment impo&s;ed by A&s;iatic jealou&s;y, they politely admitted the Roman amba&s;&s;adors to their pre|&s;ence, their table, and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his pre&s;ents to Cerca, the principal queen, he ad|mired the &s;ingular architecture of her man&s;ion, the height of the round columns, the &s;ize and beauty of the wood, which was curiou&s;ly &s;haped or turned, or poli&s;hed, or carved; and his atten|tive eye was able to di&s;cover &s;ome ta&s;te in the ornaments, and &s;ome regularity in the propor|tions. After pa&s;&s;ing through the guards, who watched before the gate, the amba&s;&s;adors were introduced into the private apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their vi&s;it &s;itting, or rather lying, on a &s;oft couch; the floor was co|vered with a carpet; the dome&s;tics formed a cir|cle round the queen; and her dam&s;els, &s;eated on the ground, were employed in working the varie|gated embroidery which adorned the dre&s;s of the Barbaric warriors. The Huns were ambitious of di&s;playing tho&s;e riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the trappings of their hor&s;es, their &s;words, and even their &s;hoes, were &s;tudded with gold and precious &s;tones; and their tables were profu&s;ely &s;pread with plates, and gob|lets, and va&s;es of gold and &s;ilver, which had
<PB N="75" REF="84">
been fa&s;hioned by the labour of Grecian arti&s;ts. The monarch alone a&s;&s;umed the &s;uperior pride of &s;till adhering to the &s;implicity of his Scythian ance&s;tors <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">When the Moguls di&s;played the &s;poils of A&s;ia, in the diet of Toncat, the throne of Zingis was &s;till covered with the original black felt carpet, on which he had been &s;eated, when he was rai&s;ed to the command of his warlike countrymen. See Vie de Gengi&s;can, l. iv. c. 9.</NOTE>. The dre&s;s of Attila, his arms, and the furniture of his hor&s;e, were plain, without ornament, and of a &s;ingle colour. The royal table was &s;erved in wooden cups and platters; fle&s;h was his only food; and the conqueror of the North never ta&s;ted the luxury of bread.</P>
<P>When Attila fir&s;t gave audience to the Roman amba&s;&s;adors on the banks of the Danube, his tent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The beha|viour of Attila to the Roman amba&s;&s;a|dors.</NOTE> was encompa&s;&s;ed with a formidable guard. The monarch him&s;elf was &s;eated in a wooden chair. His &s;tern countenance, angry ge&s;tures, and im|patient tone, a&s;toni&s;hed the firmne&s;s of Maximin; but Vigilius had more rea&s;on to tremble, &s;ince he di&s;tinctly under&s;tood the menace, that if At|tila did not re&s;pect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful interpreter to a cro&s;s, and leave his body to the vultures. The Barbarian con|de&s;cended, by producing an accurate li&s;t, to ex|po&s;e the bold fal&s;ehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more than &s;eventeen de&s;erters could be found. But he arrogantly declared, that he apprehended only the di&s;grace of con|tending with his fugitive &s;laves; &s;ince he de&s;pi&s;ed their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which Theodofius had entru&s;ted to their arms:
<PB N="76" REF="85">
<Q REND="inline">"For what fortre&s;s" (added Attila), "what city, in the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exi&s;t, &s;ecure and impregnable, if it is our plea&s;ure that it &s;hould be erazed from the earth?"</Q> He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, however, the in|terpreter, who returned to Con&s;tantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete re&s;ti|tution, and a more &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y. His an|ger gradually &s;ub&s;ided, and his dome&s;tic &s;atis|faction, in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of E&s;lam, might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fiercene&s;s of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal village, was marked by a very &s;ingular ceremony. A numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero, and their king. They marched be|fore him, di&s;tributed into long and regular files: the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen, which the women on either &s;ide bore aloft in their hands, and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who chanted hymns and &s;ongs in the Scythian lan|guage. The wife of his favourite Onege&s;ius, with a train of female attendants, &s;aluted Attila at the door of her own hou&s;e, on his way to the palace; and offered, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, her re&s;pectful homage, by intreating him to ta&s;te the wine and meat, which &s;he had prepared for his reception. As &s;oon as the mo|narch had graciou&s;ly accepted her ho&s;pitable gift, his dome&s;tics lifted a &s;mall &s;ilver table to a con|venient height, as he &s;at on hor&s;eback; and At|tila,
<PB N="77" REF="86">
when he had touched the goblet with his lips, again &s;aluted the wife of Onege&s;ius, and continued his march. During his re&s;idence at the &s;eat of empire, his hours were not wa&s;ted in the reclu&s;e idlene&s;s of a &s;eraglio; and the king of the Huns could maintain his &s;uperior dignity, without concealing his per&s;on from the public view. He frequently a&s;&s;embled his council, and gave audience to the amba&s;&s;adors of the nations; and his people might appeal to the &s;upreme tri|bunal, which he held at &s;tated times, and, ac|cording to the ea&s;tern cu&s;tom, before the prin|cipal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the Ea&s;t and of the We&s;t, were twice in|vited to the banquets, where Attila fea&s;ted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin <NOTE PLACE="marg">The royal fea&s;t.</NOTE> and his colleagues were &s;topped on the thre&s;hold, till they had made a devout libation to the health and pro&s;perity of the king of the Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their re&s;pective &s;eats in a &s;pacious hall. The royal table and couch, covered with carpets and fine linen, was rai&s;ed by &s;everal &s;teps in the mid&s;t of the hall; and a &s;on, an uncle, or perhaps a fa|vourite king, were admitted to &s;hare the &s;imple and homely repa&s;t of Attila. Two lines of &s;mall tables, each of which contained three or four gue&s;ts, were ranged in order on either hand; the right was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t honourable, but the Romans ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that they were placed on the left; and that Beric, an unknown chieftain, mo&s;t probably of the Gothic race, pre|ceded
<PB N="78" REF="87">
the repre&s;entatives of Theodo&s;ius and Va|lentinian. The Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled with wine, and courteou&s;ly drank to the health of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed gue&s;t; who ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed, in the &s;ame manner, his loyal and re|&s;pectful vows. This ceremony was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively performed for all, or at lea&s;t for the illu&s;trious per&s;ons of the a&s;&s;embly; and a con&s;iderable time mu&s;t have been con&s;umed, &s;ince it was thrice repeated, as each cour&s;e of &s;ervice was placed on the table. But the wine &s;till remained after the meat had been removed; and the Huns conti|nued to indulge their intemperance long after the &s;ober and decent amba&s;&s;adors of the two empires had withdrawn them&s;elves from the nocturnal banquet. Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a &s;ingular opportunity of ob&s;erving the manners of the nation in their convivial amu&s;ements. Two Scythians &s;tood before the couch of Attila, and recited the ver&s;es which they had compo&s;ed, to celebrate his valour and his victories. A pro|found &s;ilence prevailed in the hall; and the at|tention of the gue&s;ts was captivated by the vocal harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits: a martial ardour fla&s;hed from the eyes of the warriors, who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expre&s;&s;ed their generous de&s;pair, that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">If we may believe Plutarch (in Demetrio, tom. v. p. 24.) it was the cu&s;tom of the Scythians, when they indulged in the plea&s;ures of the table, to awaken their languid courage by the martial harmony of twanging their bow-&s;trings.</NOTE>. This entertainment, which might be
<PB N="79" REF="88">
con&s;idered as a &s;chool of military virtue, was &s;ucceeded by a farce, that deba&s;ed the dignity of human nature. A Moori&s;h and a Scythian buffoon &s;ucce&s;&s;ively excited the mirth of the rude &s;pec|tators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dre&s;s, antic ge&s;tures, ab&s;urd &s;peeches, and the &s;trange unintelligible confu&s;ion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages; and the hall re&s;ound|ed with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In the mid&s;t of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a change of countenance, maintained his &s;tedfa&s;t and inflexible gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of Irnac, the younge&s;t of his &s;ons: he embraced the boy with a &s;mile of paternal tenderne&s;s, gently pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial affec|tion, which was ju&s;tified by the a&s;&s;urance of his prophets, that Irnac would be the future &s;upport of his family and empire. Two days afterwards, the amba&s;&s;adors received a &s;econd invitation; and they had rea&s;on to prai&s;e the politene&s;s, as well as the ho&s;pitality, of Attila. The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conver&s;ation with Maxi|min; but his civility was interrupted by rude expre&s;&s;ions, and haughty reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of intere&s;t, to &s;upport with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his &s;ecretary Con&s;tantius. <Q REND="inline">"The emperor" (&s;aid Attila) "has long promi&s;ed him a rich wife: Con&s;tantius mu&s;t not be di&s;appointed; nor &s;hould a Roman emperor de&s;erve the name of liar."</Q> On the third day, the amba&s;&s;adors

If we <HI>now</HI> review the emba&s;&s;y of Maximin, and the behaviour of Attila, we mu&s;t applaud the Bar|barian, who re&s;pected the laws of ho&s;pitality, and generou&s;ly entertained and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the mini&s;ter of a prince, who had con&s;pired again&s;t his life.

A &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, armed with full powers and magnificent gifts, was ha&s;tily &s;ent to deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two mini&s;ters of con&s;ular or patrician rank, of whom the one was great trea&s;urer, and the other was ma&s;ter-general of the armies of the Ea&s;t.

<P>IT was the opinion of Marcian, that war &s;hould be avoided, as long as it is po&s;&s;ible to pre|&s;erve a &s;ecure and honourable peace; but it was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attila threatens both em|pires, and prepares to invade Gaul, A. D. 450.</NOTE> likewi&s;e his opinion, that peace cannot be ho|nourable or &s;ecure, if the &s;overeign betrays a pu&s;illanimous aver&s;ion to war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of At|tila, who in&s;olently pre&s;&s;ed the payment of the annual tribute. The emperor &s;ignified to the Barbarians, that they mu&s;t no longer in&s;ult the maje&s;ty of Rome, by the mention of a tribute; that he was di&s;po&s;ed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful friend&s;hip of his allies; but that, if they pre&s;umed to violate the public peace, they &s;hould feel that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed troops, and arms, and re&s;olution, to repel their attacks. The &s;ame language, even in the camp of the Huns, was u&s;ed by his amba&s;&s;ador Apollonius, who&s;e bold refu&s;al to deliver the pre&s;ents, till he had been admitted to a per&s;onal interview, di&s;played a &s;en&s;e of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared to expect from the

He threatened to cha&s;ti&s;e the ra&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Theodo&s;ius; but he he&s;itated, whether he &s;hould fir&s;t direct his invincible arms again&s;t the Ea&s;tern or the We&s;tern empire. While mankind awaited his deci&s;ion with awful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he &s;ent an equal defiance to the courts of Ra|venna and Con&s;tantinople; and his mini&s;ters &s;aluted the two emperors with the &s;ame haughty declaration. <Q REND="inline">"Attila, <HI>my</HI> lord, and <HI>thy</HI> lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Alexandrian or Pa&s;chal Chronicle, which introduces this haughty me&s;&s;age, during the lifetime of Theodo&s;ius, may have anti|cipated the date; but the dull annali&s;t was incapable of inventing the original and genuine &s;tyle of Attila.</NOTE>."</Q> But as the Barbarian de&s;pi&s;ed, or affected to de&s;pi&s;e, the Romans of the Ea&s;t, whom he had &s;o often vanqui&s;hed, he &s;oon declared his re&s;olution of &s;u&s;pending the ea&s;y conque&s;t, till he had atchieved a more glo|rious and important enterpri&s;e. In the memo|rable inva&s;ions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of tho&s;e provinces; but the particular motives and provocations of Attila, can only be explained by the &s;tate of the We&s;tern empire under the reign of Valentinian, or, to &s;peak more correctly, un|der the admini&s;tration of Aetius <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The &s;econd book of the Hi&s;toire Critique de l'Etabli&s;&s;ement de la Monarchie Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e, tom. i. p. 189&mdash;424, throws great light on the &s;tate of Gaul, when it was invaded by Attila; but the ingeni|ous author, the Abb&eacute; Dubos, too often bewilders him&s;elf in &s;y&s;tem and conjecture.</NOTE>.</P>

The doctrine of prede&s;tina|tion, &s;o favourable to martial virtue, was care|fully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who a&s;&s;ured his &s;ubjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were &s;afe and invulnerable amid&s;t the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring Fates would &s;trike their victims in the bo&s;om of inglorious peace. <Q REND="inline">"I my&s;elf," continued Attila, "will throw the fir&s;t javelin, and the wretch who refu&s;es to imitate the example of his &s;o|vereign, is devoted to inevitable death."</Q> The &s;pirit of the Barbarians was rekindled by the pre|&s;ence, the voice, and the example of their in|trepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their im|patience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied, in per&s;on, the centre of the line. The nations, &s;ubject to his empire, the Rugians, the Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Bur|gundians, were extended, on either hand, over the ample &s;pace of the Catalaunian fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the O&s;trogoths, were po&s;ted on the left to oppo&s;e the kindred tribes of the Vi&s;igoths. The di&s;po&s;ition of the allies was regulated by a different principle. Sangiban, the faithle&s;s king of the Ala|ni,
<PB N="116" REF="125">
was placed in the centre; where his motions might be &s;trictly watched, and his treachery might be in&s;tantly puni&s;hed. Aetius a&s;&s;umed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the right, wing; while Tori&s;mond &s;till continued to occupy the heights which appear to have &s;tretched on the flank, and perhaps the rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the Atlan|tic were a&s;&s;embled on the plain of Ch&acirc;lons; but many of the&s;e nations had been divided by fac|tion, or conque&s;t, or emigration; and the ap|pearance of &s;imilar arms and en&s;igns, which threatened each other, pre&s;ented the image of a civil war.</P>

The body of Theodoric, pierced with honourable wounds, was di&s;covered under a heap of the &s;lain: his &s;ubjects bewailed the death of their king and father; but their tears were min|gled with &s;ongs and acclamations, and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanqui&s;hed enemy.

Yet the Goths them&s;elves were a&s;to|ni&s;hed by the fierce and undaunted a&s;pect of their formidable antagoni&s;t; and their hi&s;torian has compared Attila to a lion encompa&s;&s;ed in his den, and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations, who might have de&s;erted his &s;tandard in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, were made &s;en&s;ible, that the di&s;plea&s;ure of their monarch was the mo&s;t imminent and inevitable danger. All his in&s;truments of martial mu&s;ic ince&s;&s;antly &s;ounded a loud and animating &s;train of defiance; and the foremo&s;t troops who advanced to the a&s;&s;ault, were checked, or de&s;troyed, by &s;howers of arrows from every &s;ide of the intrenchments. It was determined in a general council of war, to be&s;iege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his provi&s;ions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a di&s;graceful treaty, or an un|equal combat. But the impatience of the Bar|barians &s;oon di&s;dained the&s;e cautious and dilatory mea&s;ures: and the mature policy of Aetius was apprehen&s;ive, that, after the extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppre&s;&s;ed by the pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the &s;uperior a&s;cendant of autho|rity and rea&s;on, to calm the pa&s;&s;ions, which the &s;on of Theodoric con&s;idered as a duty; repre|&s;ented, with &s;eeming affection, and real truth, the dangers of ab&s;ence and delay; and per&s;uaded Tori&s;mond to di&s;appoint, by his &s;peedy return, the ambitious de&s;igns of his brothers, who might occupy the throne and trea&s;ures of Thou|lou&s;e <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 41. p. 671.

After the departure of the Goths, and the &s;eparation of the allied army, Attila was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the va&s;t &s;ilence that reigned over the plains of Ch&acirc;lons: the &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome ho&s;tile &s;tratagem detained him &s;everal days within the circle of his waggons; and his retreat beyond the Rhine confe&s;&s;ed the la&s;t victory which was attchieved in the name of the We&s;tern empire.

The Thuringians &s;erved in the army of Attila: they traver&s;ed, both in their march and in their return, the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war that they exerci&s;ed the cruelties, which, about four&s;core years after|wards, were revenged by the &s;on of Clovis. They ma&s;&s;acred their ho&s;tages, as well as their cap|tives: two hundred young maidens were tortured with exqui&s;ite and unrelenting rage; their bodies were torn a&s;under by wild hor&s;es, or their bones were cru&s;hed under the weight of rolling wag|gons; and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and vul|tures.

Her tears, when &s;he returned home; her deep affliction; and her bitter reproaches again&s;t her hu&s;band, whom &s;he con&s;idered as the accomplice of his own &s;hame, excited Maximus to a ju&s;t revenge; the de&s;ire of revenge was &s;timulated by ambition; and he might rea&s;onably a&s;pire, by the free &s;uffrage of the Roman &s;enate, to the throne of a dete&s;ted and de&s;picable rival.

<P>THE lo&s;s or de&s;olation of the provinces, from the ocean to the Alps, impaired the glory and greatne&s;s of Rome: her internal pro&s;perity was ir|retrievably <NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval power of the Van|dals. A. D. 439&mdash;455.</NOTE> de&s;troyed by the &s;eparation of Africa. The rapacious Vandals confi&s;cated the patrimo|nial e&s;tates of the &s;enators, and intercepted the regular &s;ub&s;idies, which relieved the poverty, and encouraged the idlene&s;s, of the plebeians. The di&s;tre&s;s of the Romans was &s;oon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the province, &s;o long cultivated for their u&s;e by indu&s;trious and obedient &s;ubjects, was armed again&s;t them by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tandard of Gen&s;eric, had acquired a rich and fertile territory, which &s;tretched along the coa&s;t above ninety days jour|ney from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits were pre&s;&s;ed and confined, on either &s;ide, by the &s;andy de&s;ert and the Mediterranean. The di&s;covery and conque&s;t of the Black nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not

tempt the rational ambition of Gen&s;eric: but he ca&s;t his eyes towards the &s;ea; he re&s;olved to create a naval power, and his bold re&s;olution was executed with &s;teady and active per&s;everance. The woods of mount Atlas afforded an inexhau&s;tible nur|&s;ery of timber; his new &s;ubjects were &s;killed in the arts of navigation and &s;hip-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country ac|ce&s;&s;ible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of &s;ix centuries, the fleets that i&s;&s;ued from the port of Carthage again claimed the em|pire of the Mediterranean. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Vandals, the conque&s;t of Sicily, the &s;ack of Pa|lermo, and the frequent de&s;cents on the coa&s;t of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian, and the &s;i&s;ter of Theodo&s;ius. Al|liances were formed; and armaments, expen&s;ive and ineffectual, were prepared, for the de&s;truction of the common enemy; who re&s;erved his courage to encounter tho&s;e dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude. The de&s;igns of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promi&s;es, and apparent conce&s;&s;ions; and the interpo&s;ition of his formid|able confederate the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conque&s;t of Africa to the care of their dome&s;tic &s;afety. The revolutions of the palace, which left the We&s;tern empire with|out a defender, and without a lawful prince, di&s;|pelled the apprehen&s;ions, and &s;timulated the ava|rice,

This epi&s;tle, with &s;ome indulgence, may claim the prai&s;e of an elegant compo&s;ition; and it throws much light on the charac|ter of Maximus.</NOTE>, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cha|racter and reign of the empe|ror Maxi|mus, A. D. 455, March 17.</NOTE> was often alleged as a rare example of hu|man felicity. His birth was noble and illu&s;trious, &s;ince he de&s;cended from the Anician family; his dignity was &s;upported by an adequate patrimony in land and money: and the&s;e advantages of for|tune were accompanied with liberal arts, and de|cent manners, which adorn or imitate the ine&s;ti|mable gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table was ho&s;pitable and ele|gant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public, he was &s;urrounded by a train of grateful and ob|&s;equious clients <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Clientum, praevia, pedi&s;equa, circumfu&s;a, populo&s;itas, is the train which Sidonius him&s;elf (l. i. epi&s;t. 9.) a&s;&s;igns to another &s;ena|tor of con&s;ular rank.</NOTE>; and it is po&s;&s;ible that among the&s;e clients, he might de&s;erve and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome real friends. His merit was rewarded by the favour of the prince and &s;enate: he thrice exer|ci&s;ed the office of Praetorian praefect of Italy; he was twice inve&s;ted with the con&s;ul&s;hip, and he obtained the rank of patrician. The&s;e civil ho|nours were not incompatible with the enjoyment

of lei&s;ure and tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of plea&s;ure or rea&s;on, were accu|rately di&s;tributed by a water-clock; and this ava|rice of time may be allowed to prove the &s;en&s;e which Maximus entertained of his own happine&s;s. The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian, appears to excu&s;e the mo&s;t bloody revenge. Yet a philo&s;opher might have reflected, that, if the re&s;i&s;tance of his wife had been &s;incere, her cha&s;tity was &s;till inviolate, and that it could never be re&s;tored if &s;he had con&s;ented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have he&s;itated, before he plunged him&s;elf and his country into tho&s;e inevitable calamities, which mu&s;t follow the extinction of the royal hou&s;e of Theodo&s;ius. The imprudent Maximus di&s;regarded the&s;e &s;alu|tary con&s;iderations: he gratified his re&s;entment and ambition; he &s;aw the bleeding corp&s;e of Va|lentinian at his feet; and he heard him&s;elf &s;a|luted emperor by the unanimous voice of the &s;e|nate and people. But the day of his inaugura|tion was the la&s;t day of his happine&s;s. He was impri&s;oned (&s;uch is the lively expre&s;&s;ion of Si|donius) in the palace; and after pa&s;&s;ing a &s;leep|le&s;s night he &s;ighed, that he had attained the &s;um|mit of his wi&s;hes, and a&s;pired only to de&s;cend from the dangerous elevation. Oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quae&s;tor Ful|gentius; and when he looked back with unavail|ing regret on the &s;ecure plea&s;ures of his former life, the emperor exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O fortunate Da|mocles <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><L>Di&s;trictus en&s;is cui &s;uper impi&acirc;</L>

His hours, of which he had lo&s;t the command, were di&s;turbed by remor&s;e, or guilt, or terror, and his throne was &s;haken by the &s;edi|tions of the &s;oldiers, the people, and the con|federate Barbarians. The marriage of his &s;on Palladius with the elde&s;t daughter of the late em|peror, might tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of his family; but the violence which he offered to the empre&s;s Eudoxia, could proceed only from the blind impul&s;e of lu&s;t or revenge. His own wife, the cau&s;e of the&s;e tragic events, had been &s;ea&s;onably removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to &s;ubmit to the embraces of a pre&s;umptuous u&s;urper, whom &s;he &s;u&s;pected as the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions were &s;oon ju&s;tified by the indi&s;creet confe&s;&s;ion of Maximus him&s;elf; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was &s;till con&s;cious that &s;he de&s;cended from a line of emperors.

the Ea&s;t, however, Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance: her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother lan|gui&s;hed at Jeru&s;alem in di&s;grace and exile; and the &s;ceptre of Con&s;tantinople was in the hands of a &s;tranger. She directed her eyes towards Car|thage; &s;ecretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and per&s;uaded Gen&s;eric to improve the fair opportunity of di&s;gui&s;ing his rapacious de&s;igns by the &s;pecious names of honour, ju&s;tice, and compa&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding the evidence of Procopius, Evagrius, Idatius, Marcellinus, &amp;c. the learned Muratori (Annali d'Italia, tom. iv. p. 249.) doubts the reality of this invitation, and ob&s;erves, with great truth, "Non &s;i pu&ograve; dir quanto &s;ia facile il popolo a &s;ognare e "&s;pacciar voci fal&s;e." But his argument, from the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. The figs which grew near Carthage were produced to the &s;enate of Rome on the third day.</NOTE>. Whatever abilities Maximus might have &s;hewn in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation, he was found incapable of admini&s;tering an empire; and though he might ea&s;ily have been informed of the naval preparations, which were made on the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Africa, he expected with &s;u|pine indifference the approach of the enemy, without adopting any mea&s;ures of defence, of ne|gociation, or of a timely retreat. When the Van|dals di&s;embarked at the mouth of the Tyber, the emperor was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exa&s;perated multitude.

delivered to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Vandals and Moors, who&s;e blind pa&s;&s;ions revenged the injuries of Carthage.

Among the &s;poils, the &s;plendid relics of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable example of the vici&s;&s;itude of human and divine things. Since the abolition of Pa|gani&s;m, the Capitol had been violated and aban|doned; yet the &s;tatues of the gods and heroes were &s;till re&s;pected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was re&s;erved for the rapacious hands of Gen&s;eric <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The profu&s;ion of Catulus, the fir&s;t who gilt the roof of the Capitol, was not univer&s;ally approved (Plin.

and at the end of four hundred years, the &s;poils of Jeru&s;alem were transferred from Rome to Car|thage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the &s;hores of the Baltic. The&s;e ancient monuments might attract the notice of curio&s;ity, as well as of avarice. But the Chri&s;tian churches, enriched and adorned by the prevailing &s;uper&s;ti|tion of the times, afforded more plentiful mate|rials for &s;acrilege; and the pious liberality of pope Leo, who melted &s;ix &s;ilver va&s;es, the gift of Con&s;tantine, each of an hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years, that had elap&s;ed &s;ince the Gothic inva&s;ion, the pomp and luxury of Rome were in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored; and it was difficult either to e&s;cape, or to &s;atisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lei&s;ure to collect, and &s;hips to tran&s;port, the wealth of the capital. The imperial ornaments of the palace, the mag|nificent furniture and wardrobe, the &s;ideboards of ma&s;&s;y plate, were accumulated with di&s;orderly ra|pine: the gold and &s;ilver amounted to &s;everal thou&s;and talents; yet even the bra&s;s and copper were laboriou&s;ly removed.

The exploits of Theodoric &s;oon con|vinced the world, that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ance&s;tors. After the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the pa&s;&s;age of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, a&s;pired to the conque&s;t of Spain, and threatened to extingui&s;h the feeble remains of the Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona, afflicted by an ho&s;tile inva&s;ion, repre|&s;ented their injuries and their apprehen&s;ions. Count Fronto was di&s;patched, in the name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and Theodoric interpo&s;ed his weighty mediation, to declare, that, unle&s;s his bro|ther-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he &s;hould be obliged to arm in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and of Rome. <Q REND="inline">"Tell him," replied the haughty Rechiarius, "that I de&s;pi&s;e his friend|&s;hip and his arms; but that I &s;hall &s;oon try, whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulou&s;e."</Q> Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold de&s;igns of his enemy: he pa&s;&s;ed the Pyrenees at the head of the Vi&s;igoths: the Franks and Burgundians &s;erved under his &s;tandard; and though he profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf the dutiful &s;ervant of Avitus, he privately &s;tipulated, for him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the ab|&s;olute

<P>From the de&s;ign of the king of the Suevi, it is evident that the navi|gation from the ports of Gallicia to the Mediterranean was known and practi&s;ed.

The unfortunate king of the Suevi had e&s;caped to one of the ports of the ocean; but the ob&s;tinacy of the winds oppo&s;ed his flight; he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither de&s;ired nor expected mercy, received, with manly con&s;tancy, the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody &s;acrifice to policy or re&s;entment, Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Lu&s;itania, without meeting any re&s;i&s;tance, except from the miracu|lous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was &s;topped in

Whil&s;t the king of the Vi&s;igoths fought and vanqui&s;hed in the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the honour and the intere&s;t of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the di&s;grace of a friend, whom he had &s;eated on the throne of the We&s;tern empire <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">This Suevic was is the mo&s;t authentic part of the Chronicle of Idatius, who, as bi&s;hop of Iria Flavia, was him&s;elf a &s;pectator and a &s;ufferer.

With this view, he grant|ed an univer&s;al amne&s;ty, a final and ab&s;olute di&s;|charge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fi&s;cal officers might demand from the people. This wi&s;e dere|liction of ob&s;olete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified the &s;ources of the public revenue; and the &s;ubject, who could now look back without de&s;pair, might labour with hope and gratitude for him&s;elf and for his coun|try. II. In the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and collection of taxes Majorian re&s;tored the ordinary juri&s;diction of the provincial magi&s;trates; and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the extra|ordinary commi&s;&s;ions which had been introduced, in the name of the emperor him&s;elf, or of the Praetorian praefects. The favourite &s;ervants, who obtained &s;uch irregular powers, were in&s;olent in their behaviour, and arbitrary in their demands: they affected to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ubordinate tribunals,

They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they refu&s;ed the current coin of the empire, and would accept only &s;uch ancient pieces as were &s;tamped with the names of Fau&s;tina or the Antonines. The &s;ubject, who was unprovided with the&s;e curious medals, had recour&s;e to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or, if he &s;ucceeded in the re&s;earch, his impo&s;ition was doubled, according to the weight and value of the money of former times <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">The learned Greaves (vol. i. p. 329, 330, 331.) has found, by a diligent inquiry, that <HI>aurei</HI> of the Antonines weighed one hundred and eighteen, and tho&s;e of the fifth century only &s;ixty-eight, Engli&s;h grains.

of their municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of the provincial magi&s;trates, to re&s;ume their office of levying the tribute; but, in&s;tead of being made re&s;pon&s;ible for the whole &s;um a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on their di&s;trict, they are only requir|ed to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and of the defaulters who are &s;till indebted to the public. IV. But Majorian was not ignorant, that the&s;e corporate bodies were too much inclined to re|taliate the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion which they had &s;uffered; and he therefore revives the u&s;eful office of the <HI>defenders of cities.</HI> He exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free a&s;&s;embly, &s;ome man of di&s;cretion and integrity, who would dare to a&s;&s;ert their privileges, to repre&s;ent their griev|ances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abu&s;es that were committed under the &s;anction of his name and authority.</P>
<P>The &s;pectator, who ca&s;ts a mournful view over <NOTE PLACE="marg">The edi|fices of Rome.</NOTE> the ruins of ancient Rome, is tempted to accu&s;e the memory of the Goths and Vandals, for the mi&s;chief which they had neither lei&s;ure, nor power, nor perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The tempe&s;t of war might &s;trike &s;ome lofty tur|rets to the ground; but the de&s;truction which un|dermined the foundations of tho&s;e ma&s;&s;y fabrics, was pro&s;ecuted, &s;lowly and &s;ilently, during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of in|tere&s;t, that afterwards operated without &s;hame or controul, were &s;everely checked by the ta&s;te and &s;pirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of
<PB N="175" REF="184">
the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and theatres might &s;till excite, but they &s;eldom gratified, the de&s;ires of the people: the temples, which had e&s;caped the zeal of the Chri&s;tians, were no longer inha|bited either by gods or men; the dimini&s;hed crowds of the Romans were lo&s;t in the immen&s;e &s;pace of their baths and porticoes; and the &s;tately libraries and halls of ju&s;tice became u&s;e|le&s;s to an indolent generation, who&s;e repo&s;e was &s;eldom di&s;turbed, either by &s;tudy, or bu&s;ine&s;s. The monuments of con&s;ular, or Imperial, great|ne&s;s were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital; they were only e&s;teemed as an inexhau&s;tible mine of materials, cheaper, and more convenient, than the di&s;tant quarry. Specious petitions were continually addre&s;&s;ed to the ea&s;y magi&s;trates of Rome, which &s;tated the want of &s;tones or bricks for &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary &s;er|vice: the faire&s;t forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the &s;ake of &s;ome paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who convert|ed the &s;poil to their own emolument, demoli&s;hed, with &s;acrilegious hands, the labours of their an|ce&s;tors. Majorian, who had often &s;ighed over the de&s;olation of the city, applied a &s;evere re|medy to the growing evil <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">The whole edict (Novell.

In the la&s;t in&s;tance, the legi&s;lator might &s;eem to forget the proportion of guilt and puni&s;hment; but his zeal aro&s;e from a generous principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of tho&s;e ages, in which he would have de&s;ired and de&s;erved to live. The emperor conceived, that it was his intere&s;t to increa&s;e the number of his &s;ubjects; that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accompli&s;h the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who con&s;ecrated their virginity to Chri&s;t, were re&s;trained from taking the veil, till they had reached their fortieth year. Windows under that age were compelled to form a &s;econd alliance within the term of five years, by the for|feiture of half their wealth to their neare&s;t rela|tions, or to the &s;tate. Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled. The puni&s;hment of confi&s;cation and exile was deemed &s;o inadequate

D. 457.</NOTE> to re&s;tore the happine&s;s and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Gen&s;eric, from his character and &s;ituation, their mo&s;t for|midable enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris, or Garigliano: but the Imperial troops &s;urpri&s;ed and attacked the di&s;orderly Barbarians, who were encumbered with the &s;poils of Campania; they were chaced with &s;laughter to their &s;hips, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law, was found in the num|ber of the &s;lain <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Sidon.

Such vigilance might an|nounce the character of the new reign; but the &s;tricte&s;t vigilance, and the mo&s;t numerous forces, were in&s;ufficient to protect the long-extended coa&s;t of Italy, from the depredations of a naval war. The public opinion had impo&s;ed a nobler and more arduous ta&s;k on the genius of Majo|rian. Rome expected from him alone the re&s;ti|tution of Africa; and the de&s;ign, which he form|ed, of attacking the Vandals in their new &s;ettle|ments, was the re&s;ult of bold and judicious po|licy. If the intrepid emperor could have infu&s;ed his own &s;pirit into the youth of Italy; if he could

have revived, in the field of Mars, the manly exerci&s;es in which he had always &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his equals; he might have marched again&s;t Gen&s;eric at the head of a <HI>Roman</HI> army. Such a reforma|tion of national manners might be embraced by the ri&s;ing generation; but it is the misfortune of tho&s;e princes who laboriou&s;ly &s;u&s;tain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain &s;ome immediate ad|vantage, or to avert &s;ome impending danger, they are forced to countenance, and even to mul|tiply, the mo&s;t pernicious abu&s;es. Majorian, like the weake&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors, was reduced to the di&s;graceful expedient of &s;ub&s;tituting Bar|barian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike &s;ubjects: and his &s;uperior abilities could only be di&s;played in the vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous in&s;trument, &s;o apt to recoil on the hand that u&s;ed it.

His camp was filled with Barbarian allies; his throne was &s;upported by the zeal of an affectinate people; but the emperor had fore&s;een, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, without a maritime power, to atchieve the conque&s;t of Africa. In the fir&s;t Pu|nic war, the republic had exerted &s;uch incre|dible diligence, that, within &s;ixty days after the fir&s;t &s;troke of the axe had been given in the fore&s;t, a fleet of one hundred and &s;ixty gallies proudly rode at anchor in the &s;ea <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Florus, l. ii: c. 2.

He prote&s;ted, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful language, that he was ready to &s;ubmit his per&s;on, and his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he reque&s;ted a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and it was univer&s;ally believed, that his &s;ecret libera|lity contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of this public nego|ciation.

During this &s;hort inter|val, the wind became favourable to the de&s;igns of Gen&s;eric. He manned his large&s;t &s;hips of war with the brave&s;t of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks, filled with combu&s;tible materials.

Their clo&s;e and crowded order a&s;&s;i&s;ted the progre&s;s of the fire, which was communicated with rapid and irre&s;i&s;tible violence; and the noi&s;e of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the di&s;&s;onant cries of the &s;oldiers and ma|riners, who could neither command, nor obey, increa&s;ed the horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whil&s;t they laboured to extricate them&s;elves from the fire&s;hips, and to &s;ave at lea&s;t a part of the

navy, the gallies of Gen&s;eric a&s;&s;aulted them with temperate and di&s;ciplined valour; and many of the Romans, who e&s;caped the fury of the flames, were de&s;troyed or taken by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that di&s;a&s;trous night, the he|roic, or rather de&s;perate, courage of John, one of the principal officers of Ba&s;ili&s;cus, has re&s;cued his name from oblivion. When the &s;hip, which he had bravely defended, was almo&s;t con&s;umed, he threw him&s;elf in his armour into the &s;ea, di&s;|dainfully rejected the e&s;teem and pity of Gen&s;o, the &s;on of Gen&s;eric, who pre&s;&s;ed him to accept honourable quarter, and &s;unk under the waves; exclaiming with his la&s;t breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands of tho&s;e impious dogs. Actuated by a far different &s;pirit, Ba&s;ili&s;cus, who&s;e &s;tation was the mo&s;t remote from danger, di&s;gracefully fled in the beginning of the engage|ment, returned to Con&s;tantinople with the lo&s;s of more than half of his fleet and army, and &s;heltered his guilty head in the &s;anctuary of St. Sophia, till his &s;i&s;ter, by her tears and entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Hera|clius effected his retreat through the de&s;ert; Mar|cellinus retired to Sicily, where he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, perhaps at the in&s;tigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction, that the Ro|mans them&s;elves &s;hould remove from the world his mo&s;t formidable antagoni&s;ts <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Dama&s;cius in Vit.

An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus appeared, with his accu&s;ers, be|fore a numerous a&s;&s;embly of the Roman &s;enate. The mournful garb, which they affected, excited the compa&s;&s;ion of the judges, who were &s;can|dalized by the gay and &s;plendid dre&s;s of their adver&s;ary; and when the praefect Arvandus, with the fir&s;t of the Gallic deputies, were directed to take their places on the &s;enatorial benches, the &s;ame contra&s;t of pride and mode&s;ty was ob&s;erved in their behaviour. In this memorable judg|ment, which pre&s;ented a lively image of the old republic, the Gauls expo&s;ed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the province; and as &s;oon as the minds of the audience were &s;ufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal epi&s;tle.

By their decree, he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the ob&s;cure condition of a plebeian, and ignominiou&s;ly dragged by &s;ervile hands to the public pri&s;on.

<P>Chri&s;tianity, which opened the gates of Heaven <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of their con|ver&s;ion.</NOTE> to the Barbarians, introduced an important change in their moral and political condition.

The ver&s;ion of the Scrip|tures into their native tongue, which had facili|tated their conver&s;ion, mu&s;t excite, among their clergy, &s;ome curio&s;ity to read the original text, to under&s;tand the &s;acred liturgy of the church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tradition. The&s;e &s;piritual gifts were pre&s;erved in the Greek and Latin lan|guages, which concealed the ine&s;timable monu|ments of ancient learning.

In the mo&s;t corrupt &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity, the Bar|barians might learn ju&s;tice from the <HI>law,</HI> and mercy from the <HI>go&s;pel:</HI> and if the knowledge of their duty was in&s;ufficient to guide their actions, or to regulate their pa&s;&s;ions; they were &s;ometimes re&s;trained by con&s;cience, and frequently puni&s;hed by remor&s;e. But the direct authority of religion was le&s;s effectual, than the holy communion which united them with their Chri&s;tian brethren in &s;pi|ritual friend&s;hip. The influence of the&s;e &s;enti|ments contributed to &s;ecure their fidelity in the &s;ervice, or the alliance, of the Romans, to alle|viate the horrors of war, to moderate the in&s;olence of conque&s;t, and to pre&s;erve, in the downfall of the empire, a permanent re&s;pect for the name and in&s;titutions of Rome. In the days of Pagani&s;m, the prie&s;ts of Gaul and Germany reigned over the people, and controuled the juri&s;diction of the ma|gi&s;trates; and the zealous pro&s;elytes transferred an equal, or more ample, mea&s;ure of devout obe|dience, to the pontiffs of the Chri&s;tian faith.

The religious war was preceded and prepared by an in&s;idious truce; per&s;ecution was made the &s;erious and important bu&s;ine&s;s of the Vandal court; and the loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, which ha&s;tened the death of Hunneric, revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance, of the church.

The pride and curio&s;ity of the Norman conquerors, prompted them to enquire into the ancient hi&s;tory of Bri|tain: they li&s;tened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince, who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common enemies. His romance, tran&s;cribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth, and afterwards tran&s;lated into the fa&s;hionable idiom of the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments, which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the twelfth century.

<P>The decay of Rome has been frequently a&s;crib|ed to the tran&s;lation of the &s;eat of empire; but this hi&s;tory has already &s;hewn, that the powers of government were <HI>divided,</HI> rather than <HI>removed.</HI> The throne of Con&s;tantinople was erected in the Ea&s;t; while the We&s;t was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a &s;eries of emperors who held their re&s;idence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the &s;trength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the in&s;truments of an oppre&s;&s;ive and arbitrary &s;y&s;tem were multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was intro|duced and &s;upported between the degenerate

&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Theodo&s;ius. Extreme di&s;tre&s;s, which unites the virtue of a free people, embitters the factions of a declining monarchy.

Under the &s;ucceeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was re&s;tored; but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffectual; and the national &s;chi&s;m of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of intere&s;t, and even of religion. Yet the &s;alutary event approved in &s;ome mea&s;ure the judgment of Con&s;tantine.

The clergy &s;ucce&s;sfully preached the doctrines of pa|tience and pu&s;illanimity; the active virtues of &s;ociety were di&s;couraged; and the la&s;t remains

of military &s;pirit were buried in the cloy&s;ter: a large portion of public and private wealth was con&s;ecrated to the &s;pecious demands of charity and devotion; and the &s;oldiers pay was lavi&s;hed on the u&s;ele&s;s multitudes of both &s;exes, who could only plead the merits of ab&s;tinence and cha&s;tity. Faith, zeal, curio&s;ity, and the more earthly pa&s;|&s;ions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological di&s;cord; the church, and even the &s;tate, were di&s;tracted by religious factions, who&s;e conflicts were &s;ometimes bloody, and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to &s;ynods; the Roman world was oppre&s;&s;ed by a new &s;pecies of tyranny; and the per&s;ecuted &s;ects became the &s;ecret enemies of their country. Yet party-&s;pirit, however per|nicious or ab&s;urd, is a principle of union as well as of di&s;&s;ention. The bi&s;hops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of pa&s;&s;ive obedience to a lawful and orthodox &s;overeign; their frequent a&s;&s;emblies, and perpetual corre|&s;pondence, maintained the communion of di&s;tant churches; and the benevolent temper of the go|&s;pel was &s;trengthened, though confined, by the &s;piritual alliance of the Catholics. The &s;acred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a &s;ervile and effeminate age; but if &s;uper&s;ti|tion had not afforded a decent retreat, the &s;ame vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to de&s;ert, from ba&s;er motives, the &s;tandard of the republic. Religious precepts are ea&s;ily obeyed, which indulge and &s;anctify the natural inclinations

of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influ|ence of Chri&s;tianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the Barbarian pro|&s;elytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was ha&s;tened by the conver&s;ion of Con|&s;tantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.</P>
<P>This awful revolution may be u&s;efully applied to the in&s;truction of the pre&s;ent age.

The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns, a&s;&s;umed in <HI>their</HI> turn the &s;pirit of conque&s;t; the endle&s;s column of Barbarians pre&s;&s;ed on the Roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremo&s;t were de&s;troyed, the vacant &s;pace was in&s;tantly repleni&s;hed by new a&s;&s;ailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer i&s;&s;ue from the North; and the long repo&s;e, which has been imputed to the decrea&s;e of population, is the happy con&s;equence of the progre&s;s of arts and agriculture. In&s;tead of &s;ome rude villages, thinly &s;cattered among its woods and mora&s;&s;es, Germany now produces a li&s;t of two thou&s;and three hundred walled towns: the Chri&s;tian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the Han&s;e merchants, with the Teutonic knights, have extended their colonies along the coa&s;t of the Baltic, as far as the Gulf of Finland.

The plough, the loom, and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fierce&s;t of the Tar|tar hords have been taught to tremble and obey. The reign of independent Barbari&s;m is now con|tracted to a narrow &s;pan; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks, who&s;e forces may be al|mo&s;t numbered, cannot &s;eriou&s;ly excite the ap|prehen&s;ions of the great republic of Europe <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The French and Engli&s;h editors of the Genealogical Hi&s;tory of the Tartars have &s;ubjoined a curious, though imperfect, de&s;crip|tion of their pre&s;ent &s;tate.

The Arabs or Saracens, who &s;pread their conque&s;ts from India to Sapin, had langui&s;hed in poverty and contempt, till Mahomet breathed into tho&s;e &s;avage bodies the &s;oul of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">II. The empire of Rome was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ingular and perfect coalition of its mem|bers.

Barbarians from the bo&s;om of their mother|country <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The prudent reader will determine how far this general propo|&s;ition is weakened by the revolt of the I&s;aurians, the independence of Britain and Armorica, the Moori&s;h tribes, or the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain (vol. i. p. 240. vol. iii. p. 273. 337. 434.).</NOTE>. But this union was purcha&s;ed by the lo&s;s of national freedom and military &s;pirit; and the &s;ervile provinces, de&s;titute of life and motion, expected their &s;afety from the mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders of a di&s;tant court. The happine&s;s of an hundred millions depended on the per&s;onal merit of one, or two, men, perhaps children, who&s;e minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and de&s;potic power. The deepe&s;t wounds were in|flicted on the empire during the minorities of the &s;ons and grand&s;ons of Theodo&s;ius; and after tho&s;e incapable princes &s;eemed to attain the age of manhood, they abandoned the church to the bi&s;hops, the &s;tate to the eunuchs, and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into twelve powerful, though un|equal, kingdoms, three re&s;pectable common|wealths, and a variety of &s;maller, though inde|pendent, &s;tates: the chances of royal and mini&s;terial talents are multiplied, at lea&s;t, with the number of its rulers; and a Julian, or Semi|ramis, may reign in the North, while Arcadius and Honorius again &s;lumber on the thrones of the South.

or, at lea&s;t, of moderation; and &s;ome &s;en&s;e of honour and ju&s;tice is introduced into the mo&s;t defective con&s;titutions by the general manners of the times. In peace, the progre&s;s of knowledge and indu&s;try is accelerated by the emulation of &s;o many active rivals: in war, the European forces are exerci&s;ed by temperate and undeci&s;ive conte&s;ts. If a &s;avage conqueror &s;hould i&s;&s;ue from the de&s;erts of Tartary, he mu&s;t repeatedly van|qui&s;h the robu&s;t pea&s;ants of Ru&s;&s;ia, the numerous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen of Britain; who, per|haps, might confederate for their common de|fence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry &s;lavery and de&s;olation as far as the Atlantic Ocean, ten thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els would tran&s;port be|yond their pur&s;uit the remains of civili&s;ed &s;ociety; and Europe would revive and flouri&s;h in the American world, which is already filled with her colonies, and in&s;titutions <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">America now contains about &s;ix millions of European blood and de&s;cent; and their numbers, at lea&s;t in the North, are conti|nually increa&s;ing.

<P N="3">III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the &s;trength and courage of Bar|barians. In every age they have oppre&s;&s;ed the polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and Per&s;ia, who neglected, and &s;till neglect, to coun|terbalance the&s;e natural powers by the re&s;ources of military art. The warlike &s;tates of antiquity,
<PB N="416" REF="425">
Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race of &s;oldiers; exerci&s;ed their bodies, di&s;ciplined their courage, multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the iron, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, into &s;trong and &s;erviceable weapons. But this &s;uperiority in&s;en&s;ibly declined with their laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Con|&s;tantine and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors armed and in&s;tructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valour of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the two mo&s;t powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathe|matics, chymi&s;try, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the &s;ervice of war; and the ad|ver&s;e parties oppo&s;e to each other the mo&s;t ela|borate modes of attack and of defence. Hi&s;to|rians may indignantly ob&s;erve, that the prepara|tions of a &s;iege would found and maintain a flouri&s;hing colony <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">On avoit fait venir (for the &s;iege of Turin) 140 pieces de canon; et il e&s;t &agrave; remarquer que chaque gros canon mont&eacute; revient &agrave; environ 2000 ecus: il y avoit 110,000 boulets; 106,000 cartouches d'une fa&ccedil;on, et 300,000 d'une autre; 21,000 bombes; 27,700 gre|nades, 15,000 facs &agrave; terre, 30,000 in&s;trumens pour le pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de poudre.

Voltaire, Si&eacute;cle de Louis XIV. c. xx. in his Works, tom. xi. p. 391.</NOTE>; yet we cannot be di&s;plea&s;ed, that the &s;ubver&s;ion of a city &s;hould be a work of co&s;t and difficulty; or that an indu&s;trious people &s;hould be protected by tho&s;e arts, which &s;urvive

and &s;upply the decay of military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable bar|rier again&s;t the Tartar hor&s;e; and Europe is &s;ecure from any future irruption of Barbarians; &s;ince, before they can conquer, they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be barbarous. Their gradual advances in the &s;cience of war would always be accompanied, as we may learn from the example of Ru&s;&s;ia, with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they them&s;elves mu&s;t de|&s;erve a place among the poli&s;hed nations whom they &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e &s;peculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there &s;till remains a more humble &s;ource of comfort and hope. The di&s;coveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the do|me&s;tic hi&s;tory, or tradition, of the mo&s;t en|lightened nations, repre&s;ent the <HI>human &s;avage,</HI> naked both in mind and body, and de&s;titute of laws, of arts, of ideas, and almo&s;t of language <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">It would be an ea&s;y, though tedious ta&s;k, to produce the authorities of poets, philo&s;ophers, and hi&s;torians. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with appealing to the deci&s;ive and authentic te&s;timony of Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. i. p. 11, 12. l. iii. p. 184, &amp;c. edit. We&s;&s;eling.). The Icthyophagi, who in his time wandered along the &s;hores of the Red Sea, can only be compared to the natives of New Holland (Dampier's Voyages, vol. i. p. 464&mdash;469.).

Yet the experience of four thou&s;and years &s;hould enlarge our hopes, and dimini&s;h our apprehen|&s;ions: we cannot determine to what height the human &s;pecies may a&s;pire in their advances to|wards perfection; but it may &s;afely be pre&s;umed, that no people, unle&s;s the face of nature is changed, will relap&s;e into their original bar|bari&s;m. The improvements of &s;ociety may be viewed under a threefold a&s;pect. 1. The poet or philo&s;opher illu&s;trates his age and country by the efforts of a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> mind; but the&s;e &s;uperior powers of rea&s;on or fancy are rare and &s;ponta|neous productions; and the genius of Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite le&s;s admira|tion, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or the le&s;&s;ons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of trade and manu|factures, of arts and &s;ciences, are more &s;olid and permanent; and <HI>many</HI> individuals may be quali|fied, by education and di&s;cipline, to promote, in their re&s;pective &s;tations, the intere&s;t of the com|munity.

But this general order is the effect of &s;kill and labour; and the complex machinery may be decayed by time, or injured by violence. 3. Fortunately for mankind, the more u&s;eful, or, at lea&s;t, more nece&s;&s;ary arts, can be per|formed without &s;uperior talents, or national &s;ubordination; without the powers of <HI>one,</HI> or the union of <HI>many.</HI> Each village, each family, each individual, mu&s;t always po&s;&s;e&s;s both ability and inclination, to perpetuate the u&s;e of fire <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">It is certain, however &s;trange, that many nations have been ignorant of the u&s;e of fire. Even the ingenious natives of Otaheite, who are de&s;titute of metals, have not invented any earthen ve&s;&s;els capable of &s;u&s;taining the action of fire, and of communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain.</NOTE> and of metals; the propagation and &s;ervice of do|me&s;tic animals; the methods of hunting and fi&s;hing; the rudiments of navigation; the imper|fect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive grain; and the &s;imple practice of the mechanic trades. Private genius and public indu&s;try may be extir|tirpated; but the&s;e hardy plants &s;urvive the tempe&s;t, and &s;trike an everla&s;ting root into the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;oil.

<P>Since the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious zeal have diffu&s;ed, among the &s;avages of the Old and New World, the&s;e ine&s;timable gifts: they have been &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively propagated; they can never be lo&s;t.
