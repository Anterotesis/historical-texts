<P>_UPON <HI>Sunday, Octob.</HI> 22. 1710. (on which Day a Sermon in Defence of the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Creed was preach'd by Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>--College, at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s;) I was &s;ummon'd by Mr. <HI>At|wood</HI> of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> Deputy-Beadle, to appear before the Vice-Chancellor the next Day, at Three a Clock in the Afternoon. Accordingly, I was that Day (about Four a Clock) conducted in|to an Upper-Room of the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge; and appeared before Dr. <HI>Roderick,</HI> Provo&s;t of <HI>King</HI>'s-College, the Vice-Chancellor; Sir <HI>John Ellis,</HI> Knight, Ma&s;ter of <HI>Caius</HI>-College; Dr. <HI>James,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Queen</HI>'s, <HI>Regius</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity; Dr. <HI>Blithe,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Clare</HI>-Hall; Dr. <HI>Balder&s;ton,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>E|manuel;</HI> Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s; Dr. <HI>Richard|&s;on,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Peter-Hou&s;e;</HI> Dr. <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> Dr. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Sidney;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Lany,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> The Univer&s;ity-Regi&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Grove</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, being there al&s;o.

tho' newly come to Town, never appear'd with the Heads at any of their Meetings about me; but, <HI>publickly at lea&s;t,</HI> kept him&s;elf wholly unconcern'd in the Matter.</P>
<P>I came to the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge with a Friend, who&s;e Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance I de&s;ir'd. But he was not permitted to go up Stairs: So I was all alone be|fore my Judges. I was then immediately &s;hewed a Book by Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and ask'd whether I would look upon it, and own it to be mine? Per|ceiving that it was the <HI>Sermons and E&s;&s;ays upon &s;eve|ral Subjects,</HI> I reply'd, that I would not an&s;wer any &s;uch Que&s;tions; nor would I &s;o much as look upon the Book: Affirming, that all which I had to &s;ay, was in a written Paper in my Hands. Neither would I make any other An&s;wer; tho' then, and all along, many en&s;naring Que&s;tions were put to me. But when I &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame An&s;wers, the Vice-Chan|cellor, who (with the re&s;t) &s;eem'd much &s;urpriz'd at this cautious Conduct of mine, was oblig'd to call for other Evidence. Accordingly Mr. <HI>Crownfield,</HI> our Printer, (who had been terrify'd, and threaten'd with being turn'd out of his Place by &s;ome of the Heads, for barely permitting his Boy to carry the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> for Printing my <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tianity Reviv'd</HI> to them) was &s;ent for, and depos'd &s;o much as a|mounted to <HI>probable Evidence,</HI> That I had &s;ent the &s;mall <HI>E&s;&s;ay upon the Epi&s;tles of</HI> Ignatius, to be di|&s;pers'd in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> and that I had &s;ent a Letter to the Vice-Chancellor, [which is &s;et down <HI>p.</HI> 84, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>:] and to <HI>plain Proof,</HI> That I de|&s;ir'd his Boy might carry the fore-mention'd <HI>Propo|&s;als</HI> to the &s;everal Heads of Colleges the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> be|fore; but could &s;ay nothing to the <HI>Sermons and E&s;&s;ays on &s;everal Subjects.</HI> The <HI>Regius</HI> Profe&s;&s;or particularly wonder'd that I would not clear Mr. <HI>Crownfield,</HI> by owning the &s;ending the Propo&s;als; and intimated, That he &s;uppos'd the Vice-Chancellor would al&s;o have
<PB N="3" REF="4">
an Order from the Chancery, to oblige Mr. <HI>Benjamin Tooke</HI> the Book&s;eller to come from <HI>London,</HI> to prove the <HI>Sermons and E&s;&s;ays</HI> upon me, and to inform them how they came to <HI>Cambridge.</HI> I &s;aid that it was not yet Time to &s;ay all I intended: But that when I made my proper An&s;wer, it would be Time enough to think of &s;uch Things. That I had been accu&s;tom'd to Rea|&s;on, Arguments, and Te&s;timonies, but not to Law: So I had taken Advice as to my An&s;wers, and ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame Advice all along: Which he own'd it was rea&s;onable for me to do, as one that he believ'd had never before been us'd to &s;uch legal Proceedings. He al&s;o took notice of an Expre&s;&s;ion of mine in my Let|ter to the Vice-Chancellor, before-mention'd, as if I were apprehen&s;ive of &s;omewhat like <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> that might befal me: And he added, that he dur&s;t &s;ay, <HI>No Body there had any Intention to per&s;ecute me.</HI> About this Time it was that the Depo&s;itions of Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Town&s;end</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> of Mr. <HI>Amyas</HI> and Mr. <HI>Macro</HI> of <HI>Caius;</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Thackham</HI> of <HI>King</HI>'s; (which were in Part, if not wholly obtain'd by the Vice-Chancellor's Procurement, not by the voluntary Appearance of the Parties them&s;elves) were openly read to me, as they here follow, <HI>Verba|tim.</HI></P>

<P>But to go on with my Narrative.</P>
<P>After I had deliver'd my Paper, de&s;iring Copies of the Statute, and of the Depo&s;itions, and competent Time for my An&s;wer; the former Parts were rea|dily granted me, but the Third much debated. I de&s;ired &s;ix Weeks Time, as not too long in a Mat|ter of &s;uch great Importance; and gave particular Rea&s;ons for it. I al&s;o a&s;&s;ured them, that the main of that An&s;wer would not be what they &s;o much, and often, and earne&s;tly fear'd and caution'd again&s;t, the producing my Original Te&s;timonies in way of Ju&s;tification of my Opinions; but would principally turn on tho&s;e very Two Heads Mr. Vice-Chancellor propos'd as proper for it; <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;hewing that my Doctrines were either not truly and compleatly re|pre&s;ented, or were not &s;o contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as the Vice-Chancellor and &s;ome others imagin'd. I was an&s;wer'd, That this Con&s;i&s;tory-Court u&s;ed not to allow &s;o long Time as tho&s;e at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and thev were by no means willing to allow any con&s;iderable Time. However, the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was for a competent Time, that I might &s;end for my Papers from <HI>London.</HI> And &s;ome|body hinted, as if a Week was more u&s;ually the Time afforded in this Con&s;i&s;tory. The Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pe|terhou&s;e,</HI> tho' he did not own the Nece&s;&s;ity of a very long Time, yet confe&s;s'd that I mu&s;t have Time al|low'd me for my An&s;wer. Accordingly I fully ex|pected &s;uch Allowance. And when the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Peterhou&s;e</HI> left them, it &s;eems, a Week's Time was in|tended for that An&s;wer. But all this notwith&s;tanding, when I was finally call'd in, that Ma&s;ter being gone,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
I heard not a Syllable more about it; but was im|mediately order'd to appear again on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> to receive the main Charge, (of which pre&s;ently;) and for other farther Proceedings. And when I once &s;pake of going to <HI>London</HI> for Advice or A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Emanuel</HI> &s;aid, It was fit I &s;hould go live el&s;ewhere, and remove from <HI>Cambridge,</HI> &s;ince I had there perverted &s;ome already. The Ma&s;ters of <HI>Sidney</HI> and <HI>Pembroke</HI> not only &s;eem'd to grudge the lea&s;t Delay for my An&s;wer, but would needs tell me what an An&s;wer I was to make. I reply'd, that I &s;hould not ask their Advice for the making that An|&s;wer, but u&s;e my own Judgment. Nay, when the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> plainly own'd the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;ome con&s;iderable Time for my An&s;wer, the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke</HI> &s;eem'd very angry at him for it. Yet when I once, with &s;ome Vehemence, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There has &s;omewhat been alledg'd here, which I am &s;ur|priz'd to find &s;o many Clergymen to &s;ay;"</Q> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aning their A&s;&s;ertion, That the <HI>Three Per&s;ons</HI> collectively taken, were the <HI>One God of the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and not <HI>God the Father;</HI> contrary to all manner of Sacred and Primitive Doctrine and Language; no Notice was taken of it at all. But to go on with the main Narrative. Upon a Second Summons, I ap|pear'd again on <HI>Wedne&s;day, Octob.</HI> 25th. But now in a lower Parlour of the &s;ame Lodge, none being pre|&s;ent but my Judges, as before. Dr. <HI>Covel</HI> and Dr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> being now ab&s;ent; and Dr. <HI>Gower,</HI> Ma&s;ter of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, the Lady <HI>Margarets</HI>'s Profe&s;&s;or, pre&s;ent in their Room. When I appear d, expecting the al|lowance of Time, not only for my main An&s;wer, but for the clearing the Exceptions I had to make to their Evidence and Proceedings; in&s;tead thereof, I had only the &s;ore-mentioned Paper of the main Charge given me, and a &s;olemn Admonition therewith to leave my Errors, and return to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or el&s;e on <HI>Monday</HI> they would

<P>The Accu&s;ation which now lies again&s;t me in this Place gives me but too much Occa&s;ion both for <HI>Surprize</HI> and <HI>Complaint.</HI> For truly, I cannot but be <HI>&s;urpriz'd,</HI> that after all my Care and Concern to de|mean
<PB N="12" REF="13">
my &s;elf hone&s;tly and inoffen&s;ively both before God and Men, and to di&s;charge my &s;everal Duties as a Man, a Chri&s;tian, a Clergyman, and a Profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks in this Univer&s;ity; after an uncommon Search after, and Zeal for the pure, ori|ginal, uncorrupt Doctrines and Duties of Chri&s;tiani|ty, as they appear in the Sacred Books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, and in all the mo&s;t Ancient and Primitive Fathers; and yet, as far as po&s;&s;ible, with a con&s;tant and regular Compliance with the Rules and Orders of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> after my earne&s;t Endeavours to recover and retrieve &s;eve|ral of the Original Sacred Books of our Religion, long lo&s;t, or de&s;pis'd, or neglected in the&s;e latter Ages, at lea&s;t in the&s;e We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> and after &s;uch great Succe&s;s in tho&s;e and my other Enquiries, that of all the many Learned Per&s;ons who have perus'd my Papers, not any of them has undertaken to write an An&s;wer to them: After all this, I &s;ay, I cannot but be <HI>&s;urpriz'd,</HI> that without &s;ending for any of tho&s;e Papers, or at all examining them; and without allowing me any publick Con|ference and Di&s;putation about the Notions contained in them; while every one el&s;e is permitted, if not encouraged to preach and di&s;pute again&s;t me upon all Occa&s;ions, I am forced to &s;tand here as an Of|fender, and a Criminal on Account of them. <HI>Nico|demus,</HI> tho' &s;o timerous as to come to Je&s;us by Night only, yet ventured to &s;ay in the mid&s;t of the Rulers of the <HI>Jews,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">John VII. 50, 51.</NOTE><HI>Doth our Law judge any Man before it hear him, and know what he doth?</HI> And certainly, 'tis not con&s;i&s;tent with common Ju&s;tice, with the Nature of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, nor with the Honour of this Learned Body, to cen&s;ure or condemn either me or my Opinions, till upon a mature and &s;olemn Examination it plain|ly appears, that tho&s;e Opinions are not only fal&s;e but groundle&s;s; and by Con&s;equence, that I am
<PB N="13" REF="14">
gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in them, and ought to retract them. And give me leave to &s;ay, that this Method of Con|ference and Examination is that which ought al|ways to be, and has ordinarily been u&s;ed in &s;uch Ca&s;es. Nor has it, I &s;uppo&s;e, been any where de|nied among tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, but in the Popi&s;h Inqui&s;ion it &s;elf. And this is cer|tainly the only way to influence rea&s;onable Men in &s;uch Matters. And as to my &s;elf, I promi&s;e, that it &s;hall influence me, even to perpetual Silence, and the burning my own Papers, if the contrary Do|ctrines can produce but one Tenth Part of that Evi|dence, that Original Evidence which I &s;hall then al|lege for what I &s;hall there defend. Nor will any other Method at all weigh with me as to my Faith or Practice. For I dare &s;ay you are all per&s;uaded that I am not &s;o in&s;incere or fearful, as to retract or renounce any thing, which, upon full Examination, I am really per&s;uaded to be either a Truth or a Du|ty of the Chri&s;tian Religion, out of the Appre|hen&s;ion of what any &s;uch Tribunal as this can inflict upon me. Permit me, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, to &s;ay farther, that this Way of Conference and Examina|tion is that very Method which is mark'd out by an Ancient and Famous Precedent, when this very Statute now before you was fir&s;t us'd: I mean the Ca&s;e of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Cartwright,</HI> in the Days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> whom Archbi&s;hop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> the then Vice-Chancellor, and the Univer&s;ity, would not proceed again&s;t till they had invited him to a Conference, and that in Writing, in order to his Conviction: But which he refu&s;ed, and was thereupon cen&s;ur'd and expell'd: As the Authentick Record, a Copy of which is hereunto annex'd, will te&s;tify. The Ca&s;e is here quite otherwi&s;e. I am not only willing to accept of any &s;uch Invitation, but do here &s;olemnly Invite the Univer&s;ity to this Conference and Exami|nation. Nay, I Demand it, as the Right of the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Sacred Truths of Chri&s;tianity, and what this Learn|ed Body, cannot either in Equity, or Honour deny, that I be thus heard, and my Papers fairly and fully examin'd, before any farther Proceedings be had in this Matter. And to encourage your Acceptance of this Propo&s;al, I do &s;incerely declare that I will have no regard therein to Victory or Triumph; but will alone &s;eek for Truth, and genuine Chri&s;tianity. For God is my Witne&s;s, that I am very unwilling to be in the lea&s;t deceiv'd my &s;elf, or to deceive the Church of Chri&s;t: And that I am always very de&s;irous of the Opportunity of improving and correcting my Notions and Papers, that &s;o the lea&s;t Syllable of the Truths of Chri&s;t Je&s;us may not receive any Diminution or Mi&s;|repre&s;entation by me, when my Papers come to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>But then, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, be&s;ides my <HI>Sur|prize</HI> at the &s;everal Things above-mentioned, with Re|lation to this Procedure, I think I have great Rea|&s;on for <HI>Complaint</HI> on many Accounts al&s;o. Accord|ingly I mu&s;t here take the Liberty to <HI>complain,</HI> That Matters have a long while been very unfairly and clancularly manag'd again&s;t me: That during the la&s;t Two Years and above half, wherein it has been known that I have been upon tho&s;e Enquires whence the pre&s;ent Accu&s;ation is taken, No Vice-Chancellor, no publick Profe&s;&s;or, not any one of tho&s;e in Authority here, which are known to be the mo&s;t di&s;atisfy'd, have ever &s;ent for me and my Papers, and di&s;cour&s;ed me free|ly, or given me a friendly Caution about them. I think I have al&s;o Rea&s;on to complain, that &s;o ma|ny and &s;uch improper Ways have been try'd to pro|cure &s;ome Cen&s;ure upon me; as if I were &s;uch a publick Enemy, that all the Methods that could be thought of were to be u&s;ed for my De&s;truction. Once a <HI>Grace</HI> of the Senate Hou&s;e was to be procur'd for my Expul&s;ion, without my being heard at all. When
<PB N="15" REF="16">
that did not do, I have, as I hear, been threaten'd with the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, and with the A&s;&s;izes. Then Advice was taken, whether I could not with &s;afety be legally convicted of Here&s;y, and &s;o be ex|pell'd by Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Statutes. And now a remote Univer&s;ity Statute, not at all in its main and Ori|ginal De&s;ign, as I conceive, reaching my Ca&s;e; and &s;uch an one as, if &s;train'd to the &s;ame Rigor as to others, might expel, I believe, much the greate&s;t part of the Univer&s;ity, is at la&s;t produc'd again&s;t me. This Statute is <HI>De Concionibus,</HI> concerning publick Sermons, and &s;uch like Publick Acts and Lectures be|fore the Univer&s;ity. How can this Statute po&s;&s;ibly reach me? &s;ince I never had the Honour to preach before the Univer&s;ity in my Life. I never kept any Divini|ty Act, or oppos'd in the Divinity Schools, &s;ince I was admitted. My Publick Lectures have been all Mathematical; and being mo&s;t of them printed, will &s;hew how remote they have been from any things of this Nature. This Statute mu&s;t therefore be &s;train|ed beyond all rea&s;onable Con&s;truction e're it can af|fect me. I have indeed formerly had an Afternoon Lecture in the Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> by the Bi&s;hop's &s;ole Permi&s;&s;ion, and upon his &s;ole Salary. But 'tis the Opinion of the be&s;t Judges, that whatever I &s;aid there, can no way be us'd to my Prejudice in this Place. The Pari&s;h Churches, at lea&s;t ordinarily, when none but the Inhabitants are &s;uppos'd to be pre&s;ent, being certainly under no other Cognizance than of the Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e. And accordingly, One Per&s;on of this Univer&s;ity about a Year and a half ago did once make &s;ome Complaint to our Dioce&s;an, for what happen'd in one of tho&s;e Churches; who thereupon appointed us to appear before him at a certain Hour the next day: I came at the Hour appointed, and &s;tay'd about an Hour, expecting my Accu&s;er; but he did not come till the Bi&s;hop and my &s;elf were both gone: Which hindred
<PB N="16" REF="17">
any farther Proceedings. And &s;ure I cannot be ac|cus'd both before the Bi&s;hop, and before this Con&s;i|&s;tory for the &s;ame pretended Offences, in the &s;ame Pari&s;h Church. I do therefore in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the true Extent of this Statute may be fully con&s;ider'd before any thing be done again&s;t me by virtue of it. As al&s;o I de&s;ire it may be con&s;ider'd, whether Words pretended to be &s;poken &s;o long ago; e&s;pecially where the Time is either not &s;pecify'd at all, or not nearer than that of a whole Year's &s;pace, can be admitted again&s;t me: And whether Books publi&s;hed at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and private Di&s;cour&s;es el&s;ewhere, can come within the reach of this Statute; where the Offen|ces puni&s;hable by it mu&s;t be committed not only <HI>infra Univer&s;itatem no&s;tram,</HI> in a Place belonging to the Univer&s;ity, but mu&s;t be done <HI>public&egrave; docendo, tractan|do, vel defendendo,</HI> in publick and &s;olemn Sermons, Lectures, or Di&s;putations before the &s;ame Univer&s;ity. I do al&s;o complain, that the Chancellor of the Uni|ver&s;ity has not, as I believe, been acquainted with this Matter; when the Statute &s;ays all the Proceed|ings upon it are to be <HI>Cancellarii ju&s;&s;a.</HI> And tho' in ordinary Affairs the Vice-Chancellor may have Autho|rity enough to act for the Chancellor, and may well enough exerci&s;e that Authority, yet certainly in a Ca&s;e of &s;o uncommon a Nature, and of &s;uch mighty Con&s;equence; [the like whereto I will be bold to &s;ay never before came into this Con&s;i&s;tory;] it was but rea&s;onable that the Chancellor him&s;elf &s;hould be ac|quainted, and his Directions receiv'd, before any Proceedings &s;hould have been begun by the Univer|&s;ity. I do al&s;o complain that the Accu&s;ations or De|po&s;itions again&s;t me relate generally to Things long &s;ince pa&s;t and gone, without the pretence of any new Offences; unle&s;s the Civility of &s;ending &s;ome inoffen&s;ive Propo&s;als to any of you can be e&s;teem'd of that Nature. I hope I may well call them <HI>inof|fen&s;ive,</HI> &s;ince they plainly are &s;uch, and will appear
<PB N="17" REF="18">
&s;uch to every Chri&s;tian Reader that peru&s;es them. I have al&s;o, I think, great Rea&s;on to complain that I am, as it were, by this Procedure prevented in my hone&s;t De&s;ign, recommended to me by a very learn|ed and pious Prelate of our own Church, and readily agreed to by me, of laying all my Papers before the Convocation, which is almo&s;t now ready to fit, for their Con&s;ideration and Correction. Sure the Uni|ver&s;ity will never &s;uppo&s;e, or believe, that the Convo|cation will cen&s;ure without Examination; nor is the Univer&s;ity to prejudge a Cau&s;e, which mo&s;t properly belongs to the Cognizance and Judgment of the Con|vocation. I do al&s;o complain, that I have been &s;o ex|ceeding privately conven'd, and particularly interro|gated; and not in the Con&s;i&s;tory, before the Univer|&s;ity; where all that de&s;ir'd might have been pre&s;ent, and I might have had &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance as Law and E|quity do allow. As if &s;ome Men's Hopes of op|pre&s;&s;ing me, aro&s;e rather from the Pro&s;pect of the Terror I &s;hould be under in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, and the unwary An&s;wers I &s;hould thereupon make, than from the Strength of the Evidence, and the Noto|riety of the Offences I could be prov'd to be guilty of. I do, la&s;tly, complain, that as I am inform'd, &s;uch a &s;ort of Determination has been lately made about the Sen&s;e of that Statute whereby I am charg d, as might be&s;t reach my Ca&s;e, before I have been any way heard, or any legal Advice has been taken con|cerning the true Extent and Meaning of it; contrary, I think, to the plain Rules of Ju&s;tice and Equity in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Mr. Vice Chancellor, are the principal Oc|ca&s;ions of that <HI>Surprize</HI> and <HI>Complaint</HI> which I at fir&s;t mention'd. Not that they all directly affect your &s;elves; from whom I am willing to hope for no|thing but Fairne&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Equity; but becau&s;e they all belong to &s;ome Members of this Univer&s;ity. And, for a Conclu&s;ion, give me leave to &s;ay, that
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the&s;e Matters are of &s;uch mighty Con&s;equence, they are become &s;o very publick, and the Fairne&s;s and Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a &s;olemn Examination are &s;o generally own'd by the Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e learned Men of all Parties who have peru|&s;ed my Papers, that if the Proceeding in this Mat|ter here be with Ha&s;te, Precipitation, and Severity, tho&s;e that act in it, will not only wound their own Con&s;ciences, commit an heinous Offence again&s;t God, and thereby expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;evere Puni&s;hment from his Hand; but there will hereby be laid a la&s;ting, an indelible Blot and Reproach upon the Univer&s;ity; as undertaking ra&s;hly and violently to puni&s;h me, be|fore it appears that I am at all guilty of any Offence to de&s;erve that Puni&s;hment: While at the &s;ame time I &s;hall not only have the Comfort of an innocent Con&s;cience for my Support, but &s;hall al&s;o have the Expectation of &s;peedy Relief and Redre&s;s from the known Ju&s;tice and Equity of tho&s;e who repre&s;ent Her Sacred Maje&s;ty in Her Courts of Judicature; to which, in that Ca&s;e, I &s;hall be obliged immediately to appeal.</P>
<P>Saving therefore to my &s;elf the Liberty of making any other future Exceptions to the&s;e Proceedings a|gain&s;t me, The principal ones that I make at pre&s;ent are the&s;e: I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That I am charged with breaking that 45th Statute, which I have been uncapable of breaking, becau&s;e it only concerns &s;uch Publick Univer&s;ity-Exer|ci&s;es as I have never perform'd.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That the Place where mo&s;t of the Words are pretended to have been &s;poken, St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, is utterly out of the Juri&s;diction of the Univer&s;ity, and &s;o no ways within this Statute.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That the want of the Specification of the Time, or the too loo&s;e Specification of it, renders mo&s;t of the Depo&s;itions of no Value.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="20">
(4.) That Words charged at &s;o great a Di&s;tance of Time, cannot be &s;worn to &s;o particularly as is nece&s;|&s;ary to affect me.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) That Words &s;poken in private Conver&s;ation, or at a Coffee-Hou&s;e, or [written] in a private Letter, can no way be within this Statute.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) That no Books printed and publi&s;hed at <HI>Lon|don</HI> can be within this Statute.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) That I ought to have been conven'd publickly in the Con&s;i&s;tory, and Evidence fairly there pro|duced again&s;t me in an open Court; and not privately in a Chamber been ask'd many en&s;naring Que&s;tions, with the Exclu&s;ion of even a &s;ingle Friend, who was willing to have been there to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct me.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) That any prior Determination of the Sen&s;e of this Statute, before I have had Council allowed me, or legal Advice taken about its true Extent and Mean|ing, is of no Force at all again&s;t me.</P>
<P>And I de&s;ire and demand that I may have Time gi|ven me, and Council allow'd me to argue the Validity of the&s;e Exceptions.</P>

<P>When I had read and delivered in this Second Pa|per, I expected &s;ome An&s;wer thereto, and &s;ome legal Notice to have been taken of it. But all to no Pur|po&s;e: The Torrent was too &s;trong to be &s;topp'd by any &s;uch Methods. The Vice-Chancellor pretended,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
(without the lea&s;t Regard to what I had &s;aid,) that they were agreed that the Po&s;itions charged upon me were both plainly contrary to the Churches Doctrine; and were &s;ufficiently prov'd again&s;t me; and &s;o they would proceed. I thereupon boldly de|&s;ired to know, whether every one there pre&s;ent, (for they were then the lea&s;t Number po&s;&s;ible that could act in &s;uch a Ca&s;e) had entirely agreed to both the&s;e Propo&s;itions? And particularly ask'd Sir <HI>John Ellis</HI>'s Opinion. He an&s;wer'd, that he agreed that the Pa|per deliver'd to me contain'd Doctrines contrary to tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> But whether they had &s;ufficiently prov'd that tho&s;e Doctrines were chargeable upon me, he did not determine, but left that to others. Yet did they proceed as if Sir <HI>John</HI> had equally agreed to both tho&s;e Particulars; which 'tis certain he did not, and that he declared he did not: tho' he had hardly leave given him to fini&s;h that his Declaration. I was then very gravely and &s;olemnly ad|moni&s;hed again by the Vice-Chancellor to leave my Errors, and return to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or el&s;e he let me know, that on <HI>Monday</HI> at Three a Clock, they would proceed to execute the Statute again&s;t me; without the lea&s;t Intimation of allowing me &s;o much as one Hours Time to an&s;wer the Charge, which not till now was properly delivered to me. As to my De&s;ire of Conference and fair Examinati|on, the Vice-Chancellor &s;aid, that the <HI>Regius</HI> Profe&s;|&s;or might take me to his Lodgings and di&s;cour&s;e with me if he plea&s;ed; to which no An&s;wer was re|turned by any Body. The Lady <HI>Margaret</HI>'s Profe&s;|&s;or al&s;o once upbraided me, as if I deny'd Things there which el&s;ewhere I a&s;&s;erted; which he look'd on as no Argument of that Sincerity I pretended to. Up|on this I openly de&s;ir'd not to be mi&s;under&s;tood, but that I only requir'd Legal Proof for what was alledg|ed again&s;t me, without being en&s;nared by their Que|&s;tions, and without affirming or denying any Thing
<PB N="22" REF="23">
my &s;elf about them. Whereupon he &s;aid no more of that Matter. And the <HI>Regius</HI> Profe&s;&s;or, who un|der&s;tood me &s;o all along, did me the Ju&s;tice to put that Matter right, and to explain in what Sen&s;e he &s;uppos'd I did not now own or a&s;&s;ert any of the Things charged upon me. To which I fully a&s;&s;ent|ed; and &s;o that Imputation came to nothing. The <HI>Margaret</HI> Profe&s;&s;or farther told me, when I in&s;i&s;ted on <HI>Examination</HI> before <HI>Cen&s;ure,</HI> that I knew well e|nough, that when Hereticks aro&s;e, it was not u&s;ual to argue with them, but to quote &s;ome Canon of a Council which condemned them, and &s;o to anathe|matize them immediately. I &s;aid to him; But &s;up|po&s;e that what I &s;aid about the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;ti|tutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould at la&s;t prove to be true? He re|plied, If &s;o, he would come and heartily beg my Pardon. The Ma&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> thought Time might be allowed me for my An&s;wer. But &s;o ear|ne&s;t and vehement was the Vice-Chancellor in his Proceedings, that all &s;uch Motions came to nothing. The &s;ame Ma&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> al&s;o ask'd me why I cal|led the Con&s;titutions <HI>The Mo&s;t Sacred Book</HI> of the New Te&s;tament? I an&s;wered, becau&s;e they really were &s;o, and were &s;o e&s;teemed in the fir&s;t Ages. I al&s;o &s;aid to him, that they would repent their Severity to me: And that if he had been by, when Dr. <HI>Smal|ridge</HI> (who had read my Papers, and of whom I believed he had a very good Opinion) and my &s;elf lately di&s;cour&s;ed upon the&s;e Matters, he would &s;carce have been again&s;t their Examination before they cen&s;ured me on Account of them. Upon which he owned that he had him&s;elf al&s;o &s;een &s;ome of my Papers: Which I &s;uppo&s;e was &s;ome Time ago, when Mr. <HI>Hughes,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Town&s;end</HI> of the &s;ame College had the Peru&s;al of them: I mean tho&s;e which con|cern the Trinity and Incarnation only. But find|ing the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Sidney</HI> exceeding hot again&s;t me,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
I &s;aid to him, that I believed he had not &s;tudied the&s;e Matters. He grew pa&s;&s;ionate, and &s;aid, <HI>That was my Impudence.</HI> I &s;aid, I meant particularly as to the Con&s;titutions. He reply'd, that he had read them; but however that he knew my A&s;&s;ertions were con|trary to tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> Which in|deed he all along confin'd him&s;elf to: in&s;omuch that when on <HI>Monday</HI> the Vicechancellor had &s;aid, with &s;ome Moderation, that my Tenets were <HI>Erroneous</HI> and <HI>contrary to the Churches Doctrine,</HI> and that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|fore I ought to retract them; and I had reply'd, Let them be but once proved to be <HI>Erroneous,</HI> and I was mo&s;t ready to retract them; the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Sidney,</HI> at who&s;e Elbow I &s;tood, told me, they did not mean <HI>Ec|roneous,</HI> but <HI>contrary to the Doctrine of the Church.</HI> Nay, when I &s;aid to them, Will you condemn or cen&s;ure while none either <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>dare</HI> an&s;wer me? Some|body that was offended at that la&s;t Word, reply'd, <HI>dare?</HI> But without any farther Addition. And in|deed great Care was all along taken that the Truth or Fal&s;hood of my Doctrines &s;hould be wholly wav'd, and all &s;et upon their Contrariety to tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> without &s;o much as a Pretence that any body would an&s;wer the Arguments and Te&s;|timonies which I had to produce for them. It was once urged, that my affirming the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>Doctrine of the Apo&s;tles</HI> to be Sacred Books of the New Te&s;tament, was contrary to the Sixth Article of our Church. I de&s;ir'd that Article might be read: which was done by the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> I &s;aid there|upon, 'Tis plain that this Article owns the pre&s;ent Sacred Books, being all the Church then knew; and that had they known of more, they would have &s;et them down al&s;o: but that 'tis not affirmed in that Article that there are no other than tho&s;e, and &s;o my A&s;&s;ertion is not contrary thereto. Yet did this pa&s;s as a clear Contradiction to it. And no wonder; when in the Paper given me from the Vicechancellor. the

very <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed is it &s;elf quoted as condemning my calling God the Farher the <HI>One God of the Chri&s;|tian Religion,</HI> while yet that Creed begins with a di|rect and &s;olemn Affirmation of it; <HI>I believe in One God the Father, Almighty.</HI> After all, when the Vice|chancellor perceived that I began to draw &s;ome of the Heads into Arguing and Rea&s;oning about the&s;e Matters, he took one of the Candles him&s;elf, and &s;aying a few things to me about a Recantation, which I declar'd I could not make with a &s;afe Con|&s;cience, he &s;aid, He pitied me, and then he fairly conducted me out of the Lodge. And &s;o I took my leave: having before hinted to them, that I did not de&s;ign to wait on them any more about the&s;e Mat|ters, but to leave them to do as they plea&s;ed therein. Which Re&s;olution I kept till <HI>Monday</HI> accordingly. For when on <HI>Sunday</HI> I was again &s;ummon'd by Mr. <HI>Atwood,</HI> to appear the next Day at three a Clock, I made this An&s;wer, That I &s;aw no occa&s;ion for ap|pearing any more. However, for &s;ome Rea&s;ons, I afterward alter'd my Mind, and came, and appeared again on <HI>Monday,</HI> in a lower Room of the &s;ame Lodge, before the Heads, who were now Twelve in Number, who&s;e Names will be &s;et down pre&s;ently. And upon Mr. Vicechancellor's enquiring of me, Whe|ther I came di&s;po&s;ed to make a Retractation of tho&s;e my Errors concerning which he had before Admoni&s;h'd me? Upon Leave given, I read the following Pa|per, as my An&s;wer; and deliver'd it in as follows, <HI>verbatim.</HI></P>

<P>I did not think to have appeared to Day at all, becau&s;e I under&s;tood that this Meeting was appoint|ed only for my Retractation; for which I have neither had any con&s;iderable Time, nor any proper Motives for Conviction afforded me; and &s;o to be &s;ure I cannot be di&s;po&s;ed for any &s;uch thing.

I cannot allow that any Doctrines contrary to tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and within your Cogni|zance by the 45th Statute, have been Legally proved upon me. However, I have thought fit to appear ac|cording to the Summons giuen me Ye&s;terday. What I have at pre&s;ent to alledge again&s;t the&s;e Proceedings, be&s;ides my former Exceptions, is, That the <HI>Advice for the Study of Divinity</HI> quoted again&s;t me, was writ|ten about <HI>February</HI> 1707/8, and that the Depo&s;itions as to what I &s;aid in St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, belong to the Year 1708, and that if I committed any Offences in either Ca&s;e, they are fully and compleatly forgi|ven by the la&s;t Act of Her Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Gracious, General, and Free Pardon: Which therefore I do here Plead, in Bar to all farther Proceedings.

As to Part of Mr. <HI>Thackham</HI>'s De|po&s;ition, which may &s;eem to be a little later than that Act, it is not at all charged upon me in the Paper deliver'd to me as the whole Charge again&s;t me; and &s;o is of no force at all. And as to the remaining Charges, that from the other Part of Mr. <HI>Thackham</HI>'s Depo&s;ition, is only that I would not u&s;e a Doxology which our Church, I think, never u&s;es, nor enjoins; and which &s;tands on the alone Footing of Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tate,</HI> or &s;uch-like private Per&s;ons.

<P>Now the Reader is here to Ob&s;erve, that &s;ince all the Depo&s;itions concerning St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church are here given up, as being long before the 19<HI>th</HI> of <HI>A|pril,</HI> 1709. the Date for the Act of Pardon: Since the Pa&s;&s;ages quoted out of the <HI>Advice for the Study of Divinity,</HI> were written &s;till earlier; and there is no Pretence of the lea&s;t Evidence that I any way pub|li&s;h'd it in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> and &s;ince one Part of Mr. <HI>Thackham</HI>'s Evidence is made no u&s;e of at all in this Matter, 'Tis plain that this Bani&s;hment or Expul&s;ion is &s;olely grounded on the&s;e Three Things. (1.) My affirming with our Saviour, St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the <HI>Nicene,</HI> and all the Original Creeds, and mo&s;t ancient Fathers, that the <HI>One and Only God of the Chri|&s;tians, is God the Father,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John XVII. 3. 1 Cor. VIII. 6.</NOTE> (2.) My A&s;&s;erting an un|doubted Matter of Fact, that the Original Chri&s;tian Doxology was not the Common One, but <HI>Glory be to the Father, through the Son,</HI> or, <HI>and the Son, in the Ho|ly Gho&s;t,</HI> (3.) My <HI>Propo&s;ing</HI> to prove that the <HI>Con|&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>Doctrine of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> are Sacred Books of the New Te&s;tament; and the former of them, the <HI>mo&s;t Sacred of the Canonical Books:</HI> Which in
<PB N="28" REF="29">
time will appear to be undoubtedly true al&s;o. And all this is done without the lea&s;t Offer at any Exami|nation into the Truth or Fal&s;hood of the &s;ame A&s;&s;er|tions, and &s;o without knowing whether the whole Proceeding be not directly <HI>Fighting again&s;t God,</HI> and <HI>Oppo&s;ing and Per&s;ecuting the Go&s;pel and Religion of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> And if it prove &s;o at la&s;t, the Authors had need to think of that timely Repentance and Re|traction, which they requir'd at my Hands: Le&s;t their pre&s;ent Authority, and Pretence of an Univer&s;ity Statute, &s;hould be too little to excu&s;e them at the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>But who &s;hould be the &s;ecret Movers, or what &s;hould be the &s;ecret Rea&s;ons why, after &s;o long a Forbearance, the Vicechancellor and the Heads &s;hould all on a &s;udden, in this violent manner, re|&s;olve to Cen&s;ure and Expel me, is too deep a My&s;te|ry for me authentickly to dive into; and &s;o I mu&s;t leave it to another Tribunal. For certainly it could not be the Vicechancellor's own Motion originally; &s;ince he had forborn me all along, and was now in a manner out of his Office, and was ever remarkable for Caution and Deliberation in all his Proceedings: E&s;pecially when I &s;uppo&s;e that neither him&s;elf, nor indeed the Major Part of his A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, do at all pre|tend to have particularly Examin'd the Matters them&s;elves, concerning which they took upon them to be Judges; but went plainly at Random, by their own Interpretation of an Old Statute, to Per&s;ecute an Innocent Per&s;on for the &s;ake of what they ra&s;hly call <HI>Orthodoxy.</HI> I venture to &s;tile my &s;elf an <HI>Innocent</HI> Per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding this their Sentence again&s;t me; becau&s;e I believe that every one of my Judges acquits me in his own Con&s;cience, from any ba&s;e or &s;ini&s;ter De&s;ign; and is &s;atisfy'd, that I did no other than what is certainly every Chri&s;tian's Duty; <HI>viz.</HI> The Declaring plainly what, upon the mo&s;t com|pleat Examination, I was &s;atisfy'd were the certain
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Truths and Duties of Chri&s;tianity: For which yet, without &s;uch Examination, they have now ventur'd to Cen&s;ure and Expel me. Which things I own I dur&s;t not have had a Hand in, in any like Ca&s;e, for any Con&s;ideration what&s;oever. But tho' they were my Judges, I am not theirs; <HI>To their own Ma&s;ter they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. XIV. 4.</NOTE> And therefore I can only commit my Cau&s;e to God, the ju&s;t Judge of all the World, and leave it in his righteous Hands to deter|mine between us. However, I do heartily wi&s;h and hope, that as &s;oon as my Papers are publi&s;h'd, they will &s;till &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider them, and &s;oberly recon|&s;ider this whole Matter; and that their &s;ineere Re|pentance and Retractation will prevent the Danger of any future Puni&s;hment from God upon them, from that God <HI>who de&s;ireth not the Death of a Sinner, but his Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ended this Univer&s;ity Pro&s;ecution and Ba|ni&s;hment of me; at lea&s;t, this is all that has been done till the Date of the&s;e Papers; without the lea&s;t regard to Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Statutes, or to my Mathematick Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip depending thereon: And &s;o without the direct affecting me as Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Profe&s;&s;or: How plainly &s;oever they have depriv'd me of that Mem|ber&s;hip of the Univer&s;ity, which till now, either by Right or by Courte&s;y, I was entitled to. So I &s;hall go on no farther with this Narration. I &s;ay in the main, affecting me as Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Profe&s;&s;or only, meaning thereby that I claim &s;till, notwith&s;tanding this Expul&s;ion or Bani&s;hment, to be Profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks of Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Foundation; and have accordingly a ju&s;t Right to the Profits thereof, upon my doing that Duty by a Deputy, (as my Statutes direct on a long Ab&s;ence) which I cannot &s;o well do in Per&s;on. Otherwi&s;e, this Expul&s;ion mu&s;t <HI>affect me</HI> &s;en&s;ibly enough, in re&s;pect of my Maintenance: Since the Allowance to a Deputy, and the Lo&s;s of
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the Advantages formerly ari&s;ing from the Cour&s;es of Experiments, to &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e from Teaching privately in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and the Charges and Lo&s;&s;es of a Removal, cannot well be e&s;timated under 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; which is a great Deduction out of a &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tence. Nay, there want not tho&s;e who would &s;train this Expul&s;ion from the Univer&s;ity to a Depri|vation, as to my Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, and &s;o would deprive me of almo&s;t all, but what the Charity and Kindne&s;s of Friends might afford me. Which la&s;t Method of Sup|port is al&s;o by &s;ome envied, and complained of be|fore-hand. As if there were no way to &s;atisfy their Zeal again&s;t me, but my &s;eeing me and my Family re|duc'd to the utmo&s;t Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s, without a Friend to &s;upport and relieve me. But before I conclude, I can hardly avoid &s;aying here, that I take the true Ori|ginal Cau&s;e of this Severity to be plainly this, That I have written &s;everal <HI>Unan&s;werable Books;</HI> which are therefore a terrible Eye-&s;ore to tho&s;e who are more concern'd for Modern Orthodoxy, and the pretend|ed Power of the Church in Controver&s;ies of Faith, than for the pure and undefil'd Religion of Chri&s;t Je|&s;us. So that when it appear'd, as it has done for a con&s;iderable time, that none of the Learned could or dur&s;t undertake the An&s;wering me, in the way of Rea&s;on, Argument, and Te&s;timony, This Method of En&s;naring me by an Old Statute was thought of. And I venture to &s;ay this, the rather, becau&s;e that <HI>Open,</HI> that <HI>Unan&s;werable</HI> Challenge I made in the <HI>Po&s;t|&s;cript</HI> of <HI>Ignatius</HI> to the Orthodox, to &s;hew but one &s;in|gle Catholick Te&s;timony before the Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> which affirm'd the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t to be <HI>One God,</HI> or <HI>the One God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on; while I promis'd above an hundred Te&s;timonies in the &s;ame time, that God the Father was that <HI>One God,</HI> appears to have been the principal Evidence a|gain&s;t me, and that which was mo&s;t publickly and &s;olemnly read to me by the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> as
<PB N="31" REF="32">
the main Article of my Charge; and for which chiefly, I am Cen&s;ur'd and Expell'd. I call it an <HI>Open</HI> and an <HI>Unan&s;werable</HI> Challenge: And I here again make it to the whole Body of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World; and do venture, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to Ap|peal to the Con&s;ciences of all the truly Learned, whether what I have affirm'd on this Head, be not undoubtedly and indi&s;putably true; and &s;o whether I am not Cen&s;ur'd and Expell'd, for owning my &s;elf a Chri&s;tian; nay, I may add, for a&s;&s;erting the fir&s;t and mo&s;t Fundamental Doctrine of the whole Chri|&s;tian Religion. I know this repeated Challenge may be mo&s;t ea&s;ily An&s;wer'd, in the &s;ame way that the former was, by a repeated Cen&s;ure: For in any other way, I am &s;ure it cannot. And if that be a|gain put in Practice by any &s;uch-like Body of this Church, I &s;hall only beg one Favour, That tho&s;e who do it, will deal plainly, and declare that they are not, nor do pretend to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but <HI>Mem|bers of the Church of England</HI> only: Or at lea&s;t that they are ju&s;t &s;o far Chri&s;tians, as the Original Do|ctrines, and Duties of Chri&s;tianity, are agreeable to tho&s;e that the XXXIX Articles, the Book of Homi|lies, and the Common-Prayer-Book contain, but no farther. And then it will be &s;ome &s;mall Satisfaction to have the World know, that as in Popi&s;h Countries Chri&s;tianity is generally no farther believ'd and o|bey'd, than it is agreeable to the Decrees and Practi|ces of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o that in this Prote|&s;tant, this Reform'd Country, the Ca&s;e is the very &s;ame. Only with this Difference, that the former pretends to that Infallibility and Dominion over Con&s;cience, which the latter di&s;claims; and by con|&s;equence, that the latter is, of the two, in this Mat|ter, the mo&s;t plainly unju&s;tifiable and inexcu&s;able. However, as to my being condemn'd for a&s;&s;erting what was undeniable and unan&s;werable, we have a fa|mous Parallel Example in the Sacred Hi&s;tory. For truly

ju&s;t &s;o it was in the Ca&s;e of the Protomartyr St. <HI>Ste|phen,</HI> all due Allowance for the great difference of the Per&s;ons concern'd, and of their Circum&s;tances, being &s;till made.

<P>But now, if, after all, the Reader be de&s;irous to know what &s;ort of An&s;wer I &s;hould have made to the pre&s;ent Accu&s;ation, had I had competent time al|low'd me, I &s;hall plainly tell him in a few Words. I intended therein to have &s;tated &s;ome of my Opinions more fully and clearly than the Evidence produc'd did inform my Judges: And in order to &s;hew that then they were not &s;o contrary to the Doctrine and Settlement of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as they &s;up|pos'd, I de&s;ign'd to have in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch Heads as the&s;e:</P>
<P>To have &s;hew'd,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the Prote&s;tant Religion in general, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular, were begun up|on this Foot; I mean the Acknowledgment of the Churches Errors, and the Attempt for the Correction
<PB N="33" REF="34">
o&s; the &s;ame, even with the Hazard of the very Lives them&s;elves of the Reformers.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That they are both built on the Foundation of the Holy Scriptures, and mo&s;t Primitive Writers; and always own that all Errors, when di&s;cover'd, are to be amended by tho&s;e Original Standards.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That all Prote&s;tants, and particularly the Members of this Church, do unanimou&s;ly own the Fallibility of all Councils and Churches; and &s;o can|not be &s;urpriz'd, if, in Points never yet brought to a fair and publick Examination, &s;ome Errors be &s;up|pos'd &s;till remaining among them.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) That accordingly they have generally found Rea&s;on to alter their Opinions in &s;everal Doctrines of Con&s;equence; as our Church has in particular a|bout the Prede&s;tinarian Points: Nay, they have ge|nerally, even our Church her &s;elf, found Rea&s;on to alter &s;everal Practices of Con&s;equence al&s;o, &s;ince the time of the Reformation. And &s;o it can &s;eem no Wonder, if there &s;hould appear Occa&s;ion for the like farther Enquiries and Alterations at this Day.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) That in the grand Point before us, that of the <HI>Trinity</HI> it &s;elf, Our Church &s;ometimes &s;peaks ac|cording to tho&s;e ancient Notions which I advance; nay, commonly Prays and Practi&s;es agreeably thereto. So that the Corrections I plead for would rather be the rendring the Church's Language and Practice all of a Piece, than the entire Subver&s;ion and Alteration of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) That the mo&s;t Learned and Impartial, both Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants, and tho&s;e of our Church in particular, have in this la&s;t Age been forc'd to leave the vulgar Notions in that Matter, and to come &s;till nearer and nearer to that mo&s;t Primitive and Ratio|nal Account which I Plead for. As appears by <HI>Era&s;|mus, Grotius, Petavius, Huetius,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cudworth,</HI> Bp. <HI>Pear&s;on,</HI> Bp. <HI>Bull,</HI> the Bp. of <HI>Glonce&s;ter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> and many others. So that my Notions are &s;o far
<PB N="34" REF="35">
from New, that they are rather the proper and la&s;t Re&s;ult of the Enquiries of the Learned &s;ince the Re|formation.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) That &s;ince I have taken all along the mo&s;t Peaceable, Chri&s;tian, and Inoffen&s;ive Methods of bringing the&s;e Important Points to a fair Examina|tion; and have &s;till laid my Papers before the Go|vernors of the Church, and the Learned Members of it, for their Con&s;ideration, and the nece&s;&s;ary Corrections; I have no way offended again&s;t the Laws of the Land, or even the Statutes of the Uni|ver&s;ity, as to their main De&s;ign and Intention; which can never be &s;uppos'd to be the Puni&s;hment of an Hone&s;t and Innocent Man, when in &s;o fair, qui|et, and open a manner, he Propo&s;es Sacred Books, Doctrines, and Duties of the Go&s;pel, to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the Chri&s;tian World. However, if the Laws of the Kingdom, or Statutes of the Uni|ver&s;ity be &s;o Expounded, as to forbid any thing that the Laws of God, and of the Go&s;pel require, I know which I am to obey. <HI>Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but &s;peak the things which we have &s;een and heard.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. IV. 19. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;uch Heads as I intended more largely and fully to have pur&s;u'd, had I had time allow'd me for my An&s;wer. But &s;ince I was not afforded that, I &s;hall wave the farther Pro&s;ecution of them: And conclude, not only with the Declaration of the Rea|dine&s;s of my Submi&s;&s;ion to any Puni&s;hment, which my Governors in any &s;ort do Legally inflict upon me; but with my hearty Thanks to the Divine Pro|vidence, which has di&s;pos'd of me into this Kingdom of Freedom and Liberty, where 'tis not very much that by the Laws can be laid upon me &s;or the &s;ake of my Con&s;cience: Where therefore with &s;mall Legal Ha|zard I can greatly promote the true Religion o&s; Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And that I am not in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> or the
<PB N="35" REF="36">
like Countries, &s;ubject to the Terror of a Popi&s;h In|qui&s;ition; wherein the &s;peaking or writing a &s;mall Part of what I have here &s;poken and written, would certainly have condemned me to a loath&s;om Dunge|on, and to an Ignominious Death. The utmo&s;t Se|verities of which I hope I &s;hould yet, by God's Grace, have endur'd, rather than have retracted and renoun|ced what, upon &s;uch full and undoubted Evidence, I am entirely &s;atisfy'd, is part of the Revelation of God by his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Si|&s;ters, yea, and his own Life al&s;o, He can|not be my Di&s;ciple. And who&s;oever doth not bear his Cro&s;s, and come after me, cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lu. XIV. 26, 27.</NOTE> I End the whole with our Saviour's own Words, which in &s;ome &s;mall degree do now plainly belong to me; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they which are per&s;ecuted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, for theirs is the King|dom of Heaven.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt.

<P>When the Univer&s;ity had thus Bani&s;hed me, they &s;eemed &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s what they &s;hould do far|ther. Nor did they come to any Re&s;olution for near a Year: In which time I took the be&s;t Advice I could what was fit for me to do: And according to that Advice, and the Power I had by Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI>'s Statutes, I made a &s;ufficient Deputy, Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Hu&s;&s;ey,</HI> Fellow of <HI>Trinity</HI> College, to perform tho&s;e Duties of my Place in the Univer&s;ity, which my Ba|ni&s;hment made it not fit for me to do my &s;elf. Who yet found the Univer&s;ity in &s;uch a Temper, that he
<PB N="36" REF="37">
never dur&s;t venture actually to Read for me. Dr. <HI>Jenkins</HI> indeed, the New Ma&s;ter of St. <HI>John</HI>'s College, was &s;o fair, upon my worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Biller</HI>'s Ap|plication to him on my account, for his Con&s;ent to my Deputy's Reading for me, that He Declar'd <HI>He would Con&s;ent, if the re&s;t of the Heads were willing; but not otherwi&s;e.</HI> Which An&s;wer I took very kind|ly from him; as I think I had rea&s;on to do; e&s;pecial|ly when I compare this civil Treatment of his with that of &s;ome others. For when I once, during this interval, and I think at the &s;ame time, &s;tayed at <HI>Cambridge</HI> a few Days, and endeavour'd to make the Heads ea&s;y in the admi&s;&s;ion of my Deputy, I had a Beadle pre&s;ently &s;ent to me by Dr. <HI>Lany,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Hall, the then Deputy-Vicechancellor, to know <HI>How I dur&s;t venture to appear even in the Town of</HI> Cambridge <HI>under my Bani&s;hment from the Univer|&s;ity?</HI> Nay, I was inform'd, that One of the Heads &s;aid, <HI>I might be laid by the Heels for my pre&s;umption.</HI> About a Year after my Bani&s;hment, Dr. <HI>Lany,</HI> who was again Deputy-Vicechancellor, (for Sir <HI>Nathaniel Lloyd</HI> the Vicechancellor would never him&s;elf con|&s;ent to it;) Re&s;olv'd to Proceed to the Election of another Profe&s;&s;or, and accordingly put up a Paper upon the Doors of the Publick Schools, appointing a Day for the filling up my Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip: Which was therein Declared to have been vacated, <HI>per bannitio|nem Gulielmi Whi&s;ton,</HI> as I think the Words were; without any other Deprivation according to Mr. <HI>Lu|cas</HI>'s Statutes, by which yet alone &s;urely I could be Legally Depriv'd thereof. The Per&s;on who was Cho&s;en was Mr. <HI>Nicolas Sander&s;on;</HI> who has ever &s;ince taken upon him to be the Mathematick Profe&s;|&s;or in my room. Thus far the Proceedings of the Univer&s;ity were by their own Authority. But be|cau&s;e they were not of them&s;elves able to eject me out of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands and Profits of my Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, which tho' Legally Ve&s;ted in Tru&s;tees,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
were yet in Fact ever under the Management of the Profe&s;&s;or him&s;elf; They &s;oon apply'd for a&s;&s;i|&s;tance to the High-Court of <HI>Chancery.</HI> And after the nece&s;&s;ary Bills and An&s;wers were over, the Cau&s;e it &s;elf, and its real Merits &s;eem'd at la&s;t ready for a fair, full, and publick Hearing; for which I ju&s;tly hoped, and had prepared my &s;elf accordingly. The Points of Law, as I all along ap|prehended, were the&s;e two; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether an ha&s;ty <HI>Bani&s;hment,</HI> by an Old Univer&s;ity Statute, without hearing any Legal Exceptions, or affording any Council or Time for a proper Defence and An&s;wer to an Accu&s;ation was <HI>Statutable</HI> and <HI>Legal? Secondly,</HI> Whether &s;uch Bani&s;hment, by an Old Univer&s;ity Statute, if Legal, could <HI>Vacate a Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip</HI> which &s;tood on an intirely different Foundation; and where I had the Opinion of Council Learned in the Law, that it could have no &s;uch effect? But in&s;tead of any &s;uch Hearing, we &s;oon feared, and found that the Lord-Chancellor <HI>Harcourt</HI> would <HI>take it for granted,</HI> without a di&s;tinct Hearing, that what the Heads of the Univer&s;ity had done, was within their Power to do, and &s;o was done Legally. Nay, He was plea&s;ed, tho' unwillingly, to give the Uni|ver&s;ity <HI>Co&s;ts</HI> again&s;t me for this very and only Rea|&s;on, as he told the Court, that <HI>I had Obliged the Univer&s;ity to bring a Cau&s;e before him in Judgment, which He could not Hear;</HI> which was all the Hear|ing and Determination I had there, as to the Le|gality of my Bani&s;hment. And as to the other Que&s;tion, which was to me and my Family of much greater moment, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether &s;uch a Bani&s;hment would vacate my Mathematick Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip or not? It never came to any thing like a Hearing. Only the Lord Chancellor had been pleas'd, on a former Occa&s;ion, to Declare in Court, that <HI>Altho' He could not determine a Cau&s;e He had not heard, Yet He could not but think it &s;trange that a Profe&s;&s;or of an</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="39">
<HI>Univer&s;ity &s;hould be one that</HI> [by Bani&s;hment] <HI>was no Member of that Univer&s;ity.</HI> However, Finding &s;oon that the Torrent was then too &s;trong again&s;t me; and being promi&s;ed, if I &s;ubmitted, great good Offices with the Univer&s;ity, by the beforementioned Dr. <HI>Lany,</HI> who then acted on their behalf, I was pre|vailed on not only to deliver up my Writings, and to &s;uffer the Decree to pa&s;s again&s;t me; which were done immediately; but al&s;o to ca&s;t my &s;elf wholly upon the Mercy of the Univer&s;ity; which I did a little after by the following Petition; which indeed Dr. <HI>Lany</HI> undertook to pre&s;ent and to &s;up|port on my behalf.

<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P><HI>THAT your Petitioner (in Order to render him|&s;elf capable of being admitted Mathematical Pro|fe&s;&s;or) did long ago &s;urrender and lo&s;e the Vica|ridges of</HI> Lowe&s;toft <HI>and</HI> Ke&s;&s;ingland <HI>in the Dioce&s;e of</HI> Norwich, <HI>of a con&s;iderably greater Yearly Value than the Lands &s;ettled &s;or the Maintenance of &s;uch Profe&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That by rea&s;on of Land-Taxes while your Petitioner was Profe&s;&s;or, his Income was cor&s;iderably le&s;s than either of his Predece&s;&s;ors receiv'd; and yet your Petitioner ex|pended in Repairs, during the &s;ame time, near</HI> 50 l.</P>
<P><HI>That when (with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t any Prejudice to the E&s;tate) your Petitioner had cau&s;ed Timber to be cut &s;ufficient for rein|bur&s;ing the Moneys &s;o by him expended, as well as for the</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
<HI>Repairs then and now nece&s;&s;ary, your Petitioner was hindred from di&s;po&s;ing of any part thereof, or Reimbur|&s;ing him&s;elf thereby by the Injunction of the Court of Chancery: So that your Petitioner has now been near</HI> 50 l. <HI>out of Pocket for &s;ome Years; which has been a great Hard&s;hip on him, added to his other Misfortunes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That by your Petitioner's Intere&s;t and Application, the &s;aid E&s;tate has been for the&s;e la&s;t four Years, or thereabouts, freed from the former Taxes; which tho' it has been of little or no Advantage to him&s;elf, may be very much &s;o to tho&s;e that &s;ucceed him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That during the Time your Petitioner was Mathema|tical Profe&s;&s;or, and before he had the Misfortune of in|curring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Univer&s;ity, and was Ba|ni&s;hed from thence, He is humbly Confident, That (ac|cording to his Abilities) He duly performed the Office of</HI> Mathematical Profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><HI>That your Petitioner's Bani&s;hment was not from any Neglect of his Duty, as Mathematical Profe&s;&s;or, but meerly for certain Opinions in Religion; which He taking and believing to be True, could not Retract, with|out doing the greate&s;t Violence to his Con&s;cience; nor without being &s;en&s;ible (if he had &s;o done) that He &s;hould have de&s;erved a much greater Puni&s;hment from God than hath, or can be inflicted on him by Man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Univer&s;ity having &s;hewn a Zeal, which po&s;&s;ibly might have been expected from them for the E&s;tabli&s;hed Opinions, by Bani&s;hing your Petitioner; Yet well hoping (&s;o long as he bumbly and quietly &s;ubmitted to their Sen|tence of Bani&s;hment) it might have been con&s;i&s;tent with the Goodne&s;s of the Univer&s;ity, to have permitted him to enjoy part of the Profits of the &s;aid Lands, He ap|pointed a &s;ufficient Deputy to perform the &s;ame Office; as your Petitioner apprehended, and was advi&s;ed by his Council, He had a Power to do by the Statutes of the Founder. And when the Univer&s;ity had thought proper to appoint another to Read the Mathematical Lecture, your Petitioner readily offered to have named him his Deputy, and to have made a competent Allowance for his Pains therein.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">
<HI>That altho' your Petitioner was not indulged &s;o far, yet He has not &s;ought any Relief again&s;t the &s;aid Sentence, but has &s;ubmitted thereto; altho' the &s;aid Sentence (it continuing in force) was the only Ground of any Advan|tage to be taken again&s;t your Petitioner, as He was advi&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That your Petitioner's defending the Suit in</HI> Chancery <HI>again&s;t him, was not out of any Ob&s;tinacy or ill Will to tho&s;e that pro&s;ecuted it, or to him for who&s;e Benefit that Suit was brought, but out of a Sen&s;e of that Ju&s;tice and Care which your Petitioner owed to his Family, who&s;e main Support the Rents of the Lands in Que&s;tion were; and for Pre&s;ervation whereof your Petitioner was advi&s;ed by his Council to make &s;uch Defence, not without Hopes of Succe&s;s therein.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That yet your Petitioner's Friends advi&s;ing him to re|linqui&s;h all Legal Advantages, and to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the Mercy of the Univer&s;ity, rather than to Contend with them any further; And your Petitioner's Council not be|ing aver&s;e thereto, your Petitioner, with all Readine&s;s complied with that Advice, and gave Orders accordingly, and immediately delivered up the Principal Writings be|fore any Decree for &s;o doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That your Petitioner does now (in pur&s;uance of that Re&s;olution) &s;ubmit to the Decree of the High Court of</HI> Chancery <HI>in the Premi&s;es; in humble Confidence, That according to the Hopes then given to your Petitioner's Friends, that the Vicechancellor and the Heads of the &s;ame Univer&s;ity will have Regard to the Premi&s;es, and con&s;ider his Ca&s;e.

<P><HI>That there is a Clau&s;e in the Statutes of Mr.</HI> Lucas<HI>'s Foundation which directs, That &s;uch Moderation &s;hould be &s;hewed to his Profe&s;&s;or, that &s;hould be deprived with|out his own Fault.

<HI>his Life. As by a Copy of the &s;aid Clau&s;e underwritten appears.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That whatever Fault the Univer&s;ity has judged your Petitioner Guilty of with Relation to his Opinions in Re|ligion, or publick Profe&s;&s;ion thereof; yet your Petitioner having performed the Office of Profe&s;&s;or unblameably, as He humbly hopes, and the &s;aid Sentence of Bani&s;hment regarding only his &s;aid Opinions, and not the Di&s;charge of his Office; And your Petitioner not having any thing like &s;uch Yearly Income, as mentioned in the aforecited Clau&s;e;</HI></P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore humbly Hopes the Univer&s;ity will Judge his Ca&s;e to come with|in the Equity of the &s;aid Clau&s;e; and will make him the Allowance therein mentioned, or &s;omewhat Equivalent thereto; which will be a great Comfort and Relief to your Peti|tioner and his Family in their pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>And moreover,</HI> Your Petitioner humbly Prays, That in Regard of the Premi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s afore&s;aid, the Univer&s;ity would be plea&s;ed to Remit the Co&s;ts Decreed again&s;t him; and the rather, for that the the Court, on making the &s;aid De|cree, was plea&s;ed twice to Declare, <HI>That the Univer&s;ity ought not to ask Them;</HI> or to that Effect.
