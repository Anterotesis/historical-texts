<HEAD>A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE ENGLISH, SCOTS, and IRISH STAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE utility and dignity of the Stage, when properly con|ducted, has never been di&s;puted in any age or nation, by men of liberal &s;entiments in church or &s;tate; &s;ome ex|clamatory bla&s;ts of enthu&s;ia&s;m have indeed, at different times, made virulent, yet feeble attacks, &s;ome faint remains of the&s;e now and then i&s;&s;ue <HI>officially</HI> from Tottenham-court-road and Moorfields in&s;tructors; but even they only utter invectives to pre&s;erve cu&s;tom and affected &s;anctity, while their hearers, as well as them&s;elves, laugh at the unnece&s;&s;ary frivolous delu|&s;ion: the &s;tage &s;hould not complain of this abu&s;e, as every in|&s;titution may be, and certainly is, mi&s;conducted as well as mi&s;repre&s;ented; indeed as to the &s;candalous, irrational, and mo&s;t illiberal Roman act, adopted ridiculou&s;ly by our legi&s;la|ture, which &s;tigmatizes performers, while not only the matter and manner of their performances have been, and are legally authorized and univer&s;ally encouraged, it de&s;erves general re|probation and theatrical contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;cius, Cicero</HI>'s idol, if his profe&s;&s;ion could be originally deemed bad, &s;hould receive no credit from excellence in pur|&s;uing an infamous path; as well might a dexterous highway|man claim prai&s;e for excelling in actions totally un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>Some three years &s;ince, I publickly invited a bigotted preacher in Scotland, to bring <HI>one</HI> text of &s;cripture in corroboration of his rigid opinions; I a&s;ked, if dramatic compo&s;itions were in|con&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict chri&s;tianity, why Saint Paul &s;hould have quoted from a Greek author in that &s;phere? with &s;ome other pinching interrogations, which appeared unan&s;werable, and occa&s;ioned, what I did not wi&s;h or mean, the defection of many &s;ub&s;cribers to this per&s;on's preaching, a manife&s;t temporal in|jury to him.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of what I have to offer I &s;hall be de&s;ultory, con&s;equently unmethodical; I &s;hall produce nothing which does not, in my idea, de&s;erve notice; but as to arrangement I &s;hall let circum&s;tances and anecdotes fall in as they may, the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
more to &s;port with and amu&s;e attention; I &s;hall endeavour to pur&s;ue <HI>Othello</HI>'s rule, and "nothing extenuate," even re|&s;pecting my&s;elf, "nor ought let down in malice," concerning others: while impartiality is my guide I wi&s;h to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the moment I pa&s;s that line may contempt be my portion, the &s;ame contempt I have ever entertained for envy, malevolence, and adulation, three common attendants upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, ac|tors, and every degree of public life. A &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng &s;ymptom of pride may appear in this declaration, but a &s;trict attenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to the &s;everal degrees of human nature, with many &s;evere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubs, &s;ome gleams of &s;un&s;hine, many &s;elf-delu&s;ions, more relative ones, and rigid in&s;pection into &s;ocial connections, have made me, I pre&s;ume, a tolerable judge of the &s;ubject I now enter upon.</P>
<P>From every hi&s;torical circum&s;tance, we have rea&s;on to be|lieve that &s;uch entertainments as a theatre affords, could not be in a &s;tate of regularity or elegance for many years after their exi&s;tence: the reformation in its infancy, the grand Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, not only threatened but pro&s;ecuted; the&s;e, and other &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances, all contributed to prevent that ju&s;tice of exhibition for <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s inimitable produc|tions which they de&s;erved; no amendment could be expected in the quibbling, &s;anctified, pedantic, witch-hunting period of <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t; as to the mi&s;erable monarch his &s;on <HI>Charles,</HI> his time of royalty was &s;o perplexed, &s;o turbulent, and &s;o fatal to him&s;elf, nothing gentle, elegant, amu&s;ing, or in&s;truc|tive could po&s;&s;ibly prevail: <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s prevalence, though a glorious aera for the nation, was very unfavourable, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;o to the drama after the interregnum, if I may &s;o call an admirable and &s;pirited admini&s;tration of government.</P>
<P>A volatile, and we may add politic monarch came forward, who perceiving a &s;ettled gloom on the nation, determined to work a change by introducing the levity of wit, the glare of &s;how, the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of gallantry, and a general plan of di&s;&s;ipation, to &s;hake off attention from matters of &s;erious concern; if ever the &s;tage was pro&s;tituted it was at this time, amid&s;t a flow of great, of original powerful genius. <HI>Dryden</HI> may &s;tand a proof of the whole, who ranted pompou&s;ly, enthu&s;ia&s;tically in his tragedies, and de&s;cended to the lowe&s;t, mo&s;t ful&s;ome &s;tuff in his comedies: however in this reign we may commence the fir&s;t degree of theatrical excellence as to performers; and upon a retro&s;pect, we find great uniformity in the <HI>ca&s;t</HI> of plays, as it is phra&s;ed, every one, like a good &s;oldier, kept his place, and by not being <HI>mi&s;placed,</HI> we may conclude, made a <HI>good</HI> figure; nay, from the be&s;t accounts, we are taught to be|lieve &s;o, even the printed dramas &s;trengthen this opinion; and this is one of the be&s;t methods to judge by, both compa|ratively and deci&s;ively, as in examining the pre&s;ent &s;tage here|after
<PB N="3" REF="5">
I will clearly demon&s;trate. From this period compo&s;i|tion and repre&s;entation have, &s;ave the comedies of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and <HI>Farquhar,</HI> with <HI>Rowe</HI>'s tragedies, been improving, I mean as approaching nearer nature; I do not contend for &s;pirit, character, or invention in favour of the pre&s;ent age, but a claim to &s;uperior propriety may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;tly maintained upon compari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</P>
<P>The aera of <HI>Wilkes, Booth,</HI> and <HI>Cibber,</HI> has been highly bla|zened, and there is rea&s;on to credit tradition in many points; but from the imitators of them I have &s;een (who though they had by no means equal execution, certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their man|ner) it was offen&s;ive to cha&s;te critici&s;m; thus <HI>Quin</HI>'s turgid &s;well was derived from <HI>Booth,</HI> who catched his from <HI>Betterton</HI>; young <HI>Cibber</HI>'s caricature grimace, and &s;nip-&s;nap expre&s;&s;ion, were but the remnants of his father's oddity; and the late Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>'s genteel comedy, which he valued him&s;elf upon, was but a co&s;tive retail of that formal gentility, which obtained for Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> (when full-bottomed wigs, mechanic utterance and &s;tiff deportment were in fa&s;hion) general applau&s;e.</P>
<P>From their time to Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s introduction of nature upon the &s;tage, dramatic entertainments were mi&s;erably man|gled amid&s;t wretched anarchy and mo&s;t di&s;graceful manage|ment.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h &s;tage, till Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s a&s;&s;uming the reins of direction, was, from all I have been able to learn, &s;carce worth mention; in my own remembrance, four <HI>Elrington</HI>'s, the mo&s;t deplorable manglers of dialogue, &s;erious or comic, that ever di&s;graced a Theatre-Royal, monopolized all the prin|cipal characters; the women were perfect mop-&s;queezers, and the decorations mere puppet-&s;how trumpery: Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> laboured for, and in a great mea&s;ure effected, a reformation; if his execution as an actor had been equal to his judgement, and his general &s;ucce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s as a manager been equal to his liberality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pirit, his conde&s;cen&s;ion to performers, and his zeal for the &s;tage, he would have made ere now a very genteel fortune; but being in &s;ome points capricious, and rather too fond of rigid exerci&s;e of authority, he incurred, at various times, very prejudicial public re&s;entment; and though &s;upported by many friends, he was frequently attacked both by public and private foes, 'till at length from a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iculous attachment to court principles, (for he was wonderfully fond of a &s;mile at the ca&s;tle levees) he drew upon him&s;elf a &s;torm which blighted all his faire&s;t hopes, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re away with it the fruit of much labour and &s;everal favourable harve&s;ts.</P>
<P>To this gentleman (for whom I &s;hall always entertain a pro|per degree of re&s;pect) I &s;tand indebted for an introduction to the &s;tage, an introduction more like that of a friend than a manager, from whom, had I cho&s;en to &s;tay in his theatre, I
<PB N="4" REF="6">
had rea&s;on to expect the mo&s;t l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">beral encouragement. Here, to anticipate any biographical manufacturer, who might in future, as actor or author, gibbet me up to the view of po&s;|terity, I &s;hall give an impartial narrative of my coming into, and general progre&s;s thro' life, which will naturally take in, by connexions, &s;ome &s;chool-fellows and public cotemporaries, whom I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve from mi&s;repre&s;entation as much as I do my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Without any boa&s;t of parentage, &s;uffice it to &s;ay my father had the general repute of an hone&s;t man, who, without any brilliance of parts, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;hare of &s;en&s;e to command re|&s;pect, he had &s;een much of the world, and from thence laid in a &s;tock of liberal notions; by forty years &s;ervice in the army, during which time he had &s;een many coxcombs of for|tune, titles, or intere&s;t, put over his head, he obtained a Cap|tain's commi&s;&s;ion; in this &s;tation, mo&s;t unfortunately for me, he died when I was but &s;eventeen, he was ble&s;&s;ed with a wife, and I with a mother, who by invariable conduct proved her|&s;elf a worthy pattern of both characters.</P>
<P>The 23d of October, 1728, gave me to this mortal &s;tage; my &s;tate of infancy was mo&s;t affectionately attended to, and by unremitting care, an imperfect con&s;titution rendered very &s;trong; at ten, or a little after, I was put under the care of Mr. Butler, a clergyman, who kept a grammar-&s;chool in Digges-&s;treet, Dublin; here my fir&s;t acquaintance and inti|macy began with Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI> and <HI>Dexter,</HI> both within a year of my age; Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI>'s father re&s;iding at his rectory, his &s;on Henry was &s;ent to the care of an uncle, who then kept a book&s;eller's &s;hop, this uncle put him to Mr. <HI>Butler</HI>'s &s;chool, and lodged him at an ob&s;cure butcher's in an ob&s;cure market, as I pre&s;ume for cheapne&s;s &s;ake; not very happy in his &s;ituation, he frequently, by leave, pa&s;&s;ed a few days at my father's with me, and being of a grave ca&s;t was much liked by all the family as well as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>During the &s;pace of five years we were in&s;eparable, and, as I thought, that kind of e&s;teem daily grew upon us which &s;el|dom terminates but with life. At fifteen I had the misfortune to obtain a commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame regiment with my father, the inconveniency of which &s;tation I did not experience till the death of my be&s;t friend brought it to light; indeed before that melancholy event I began to di&s;like the &s;chool of Mars, which was then, and I am afraid is too much &s;o &s;till, a &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation and exce&s;s, exceedingly dangerous for a young unformed mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of warm pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the year of the rebellion, a camp of 5000 men was formed at Bennet's-bridge, near Kilkenny, which tho' a plea&s;|ing &s;how, was certainly an idle affair, di&s;cipline being in a mo&s;t relaxed &s;tate; our marchings and counter-marchings, our
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;weatings and our &s;wimmings, were almo&s;t as laughable as Major <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urgeon</HI>'s expedition to Acton, Ealing, &amp;c. however we furni&s;hed many important paragraphs for the Dublin news|papers&punc; one of which I well remember, though we were but fifty miles from the capital, killed 500 of us by an epidemical di&s;temper, which had never been heard of in the camp; a &s;trong proof of what authentic intelligence tho&s;e political ve|hicles convey.</P>
<P>From Bennet's-bridge we returned to Dublin duty, here I found Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI> and <HI>Dexter</HI> members of Trinity-college; the former complained grievou&s;ly at the narrowne&s;s of his al|lowance; lamenting his di&s;content, in a romantic fit of friend|&s;hip, I gave him my commi&s;&s;ion, purpo&s;ing to accompli&s;h my|&s;elf for the church; this circum&s;tance he has often mentioned, as I have been informed, however he had not intere&s;t to get the tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fer ratified by government. From Dublin we were ordered into &s;eparate quarters, the company I belonged to was de&s;tined for Ca&s;hell, neither the Captain nor Lieutenant at|tending &mdash;a pretty circum&s;tance in time of war! the care of a hundred men fell to my &s;hare; the route pointed out our way, and we pur&s;ued it with commendable regularity, &s;ave, as I &s;u&s;pected, the plunder of &s;ome hen-roo&s;ts; on our arrival at Ca&s;hell, a well &s;ituated, plea&s;ant, plentiful city, I received a complimentary me&s;&s;age from the new mayor, who was that day giving a fea&s;t on commencing magi&s;tracy, to partake of the fe&s;tivity.&mdash;I attended, was received with mo&s;t polite ho&s;|pitality, and found my&s;elf immediately acquainted with near thirty leading gentlemen; thus far was well, but it being a kind of cu&s;tom in that county to drink a vi&s;iter's &s;en&s;es away, I &s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t formidable attack, &s;urrounded by &s;ea&s;oned veterans; at length my prudence, head, and heels gave way, and I fell a &s;acrifice to Bacchus, but not till three Aldermen and two Par&s;ons had previou&s;ly fallen pro&s;trate.</P>
<P>This was rather an unfavourable commencement; but dur|ing my &s;tay in the place afterwards, I kept rather aloof, and was better enabled thereto by pa&s;&s;ing much time in the family of a gentleman who had three very agreeable daughters, one of whom, tho' at lea&s;t twelve years older than my&s;elf, had rearly captivated me; however, Cupid perhaps thinking me a trifling conque&s;t, let me for that time e&s;cape. Dr. <HI>Price,</HI> then Archbi&s;hop of the &s;ee, was another &s;trong motive of pre|vention from exce&s;s, for as that liberal-minded prelate very conde&s;cendingly gave me a general invitation to his palace, and to ride with him, which took place every fair morning. I was edifyingly drawn from the company of tho&s;e who prefer hunting and the bottle to every mental enjoyment.</P>
<P>I was not above four months in this very agreeable, and I may add, profitable &s;ituation, till my party was ordered to Kin|&s;ale,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
where a large number of French pri&s;oners were rather refractory. At Corke I found two hundred of tho&s;e gently waiting to be conducted to Kin&s;ale by me, I took them in charge, but never recollected, till we had marched eight miles, that there was not a grain of ammunition in the whole party; however nothing ami&s;s happened.</P>
<P>At Kin&s;ale di&s;cipline took place, and the young officers were commendably attentive, but being altogether in a me&s;s we mi&s;led one another abominably, both as to expences and con&s;titutions; our propen&s;ity to di&s;&s;ipation was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the good-natured volatility of Capt. <HI>Henry Boyle Wal&s;ingham,</HI> &s;on of the then Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, who&s;e unbounded good-nature, and uncommon flow of &s;pirits, rendered him amiably delu&s;ive; and per&s;ons who had little but their pay, endeavouring to a&s;&s;ociate with him, ran into difficulties, which however his genero&s;ity, having a large income be&s;ides a captain's commi&s;&s;ion, often removed.</P>
<P>I cannot pay a ju&s;t tribute to the merits of this young gentle|man, taken out of life too &s;oon, as with a few more years, and reflection, he would have been a very compleat ornament of &s;ociety, and a mo&s;t valuable friend to his country.</P>
<P>While we were at Kin&s;ale together, an account reached us that liberty was given to rai&s;e two regiments for the Dutch &s;ervice; being tired of a life &s;o inactive in the military view as ours then was, we determined to apply for commi&s;&s;ions of an advanced rank in one of tho&s;e regiments, he promi&s;ed to take me by the hand, which would have in&s;ured me &s;ucce&s;s, and even offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t with money if any thing of that kind &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary. The Dutch de&s;ign being dropped on a view of peace, I was fooli&s;h enough to give a hundred guineas for advance of rank in the &s;ame regiment, without con&s;idering it took me from a &s;tation wherein I &s;tood &s;ecure from reduction, and placed me in one of the four additional companies, which about eight months after were reduced; here I found my&s;elf within the penurious limits of half-pay; I had a right to &s;ome freehold property, but being under age could not di&s;po&s;e of it, and was cheated out of the rent, all but a trifle, by a kna|vi&s;h tenant.</P>
<P>Here I flew to the &s;tage, without any great affection for it as a performer, and found a mo&s;t gentleman-like reception from Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> who judiciou&s;ly recommended <HI>Aboan,</HI> in <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ko,</HI> for my trial, in which, notwith&s;tanding a mo&s;t un|con&s;equential figure, and uncommon timidity, I &s;ucceeded be|yond my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; but this did by no means reconcile me to the back of the curtain, as the &s;pirit of malevolence, envy, and &s;candal, was hourly invading my ears. A &s;ea&s;on and a half pa&s;&s;ed without one &s;ymptom of am|bition to urge for parts, and at a time when Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> had
<PB N="7" REF="9">
marked out a very reputable ca&s;t for me I declined; &s;o preci|pitate a retreat was in a great mea&s;ure occa&s;ioned by receiving a letter, that an uncle of mine, till then totally unknown to me even by name, had died in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and left me 800 l. this gave me a turn for dome&s;tic life, as the &s;ale of my little freehold was likely, exclu&s;ive of a 500 l. mortgage, to produce me 700 l. more. When of age, I was advi&s;ed, that on coming to London, or by &s;ending proper authority, I might receive my Indian legacy; de&s;irous of &s;eeing the Engli&s;h ca|pital I &s;et out.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall return a little.&mdash;During my connection with the Dublin theatre, I received a letter from Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op,</HI> then in London, that he had been drawn from Ireland by the invita|tion of an uncle, who, as he &s;aid, would do nothing material for him; that he had offered him&s;elf to Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> who both (the latter is not &s;urpri&s;ing) deemed him un|worthy acceptance, and therefore reque&s;ted I would mention him to Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>; I did, and was informed that a Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> with whom we were both intimate, had previou&s;ly mentioned the matter; I was a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions, which I an&s;wered with all the friend&s;hip and impartiality (my ever fa|vourite principle) would allow. Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> always above en|vy, gave him a cordial invitation; he came over and had his choice of parts, he very judiciou&s;ly cho&s;e <HI>Zanga,</HI> in the <HI>Re|venge,</HI> and di&s;played in it an a&s;toni&s;hing degree of beautiful wildne&s;s; his amazing powers of voice were clearly perceived and unanimou&s;ly approved; his action was what in a great mea&s;ure it ever remained, forced, aukward, and unpicture&s;que; his empha&s;is mechanical and laborious; however, a whole pit full of collegians terrified critici&s;m from any exertion for two nights; and indeed, his merit went &s;o far before his faults, that the encouragement, tho' enthu&s;ia&s;tic, was right.</P>
<P>The &s;ame week which produced Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI> to public view, furni&s;hed the &s;tage with another very con&s;iderable ornament, Mr. <HI>Digges,</HI> who had been an officer; a young gentleman furni&s;hed with very agreeable and e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites, &s;uch as a graceful per&s;on, a comely countenance, marking eyes, and a full-toned, di&s;tinct, tho' not harmonious voice.</P>
<P>The&s;e two competitors &s;et off in the race of fame nearly to|gether, and emulated with becoming &s;pirit; however, Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op,</HI> both in diligence and powers, rather out&s;tripped his competitor, tho' Mr. <HI>Digges</HI> has &s;ince &s;hown him&s;elf a much more general performer. By &s;o powerful a reinforcement Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> had a brilliant &s;ea&s;on, nor did he, as has been prac|ti&s;ed &s;ince, bind ri&s;ing merit to a kind of an apprentice&s;hip, upon penurious terms, he rewarded them liberally, and brought them forward with rapid &s;peed.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">A ludicrous in&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI>'s capricious haughtine&s;s may, out of many, be produced; after performing the part of <HI>Zanga</HI> three nights, he cho&s;e <HI>Richard</HI> for a fourth appearance, and mo&s;t unaccountably dre&s;&s;ed the character in puckered white &s;attin; Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erving that it had a mo&s;t coxcombly appearance, the remark reached Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op</HI>'s ear, who next morning went to the manager's room, and mo&s;t empha|tically addre&s;&s;ed him thus:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. <HI>She&mdash;ri&mdash;dan,</HI> I hear you &s;aid I dre&s;&s;ed <HI>Richard</HI> like a <HI>cox&mdash;comb</HI>; that is an <HI>af&mdash;front</HI>; you wear a &s;word, pull it out of the <HI>&s;cab&mdash;bard,</HI> I'll draw mine, and thru&s;t it into your <HI>bel&mdash;ly.</HI>"</Q>
This furious attack was &s;miled off, and had an amicable conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance here &s;trikes recollection painfully, which is, that &s;ucce&s;s, in le&s;s than a month, rai&s;ed my &s;chool-fellow &s;o high on tragedy-&s;tilts, that a mo&s;t ungracious re&s;erve prevailed in his deportment, and even to me he was the great man tho' civil. Tho' I ever admired merit, and re&s;pected pre-eminence, I never did, nor never will, idolize either; this he wanted in both re&s;pects; I would not flatter, my friend&s;hip forbad it; he grew &s;hy according to the dictates of his pride; thus fell gradually into decay, what I wi&s;hed, a permanent friend&s;hip. I may have been too ready to catch offence, but he certainly was too ready to furni&s;h cau&s;e; I was rather concerned at &s;uch a divorce of an early regard, yet I believe we &s;till entertained good wi&s;hes for each other, and am willing to &s;tile it the jar|ring of two oddities, who had not forbearance &s;ufficient for each others foibles.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ed defection of a friend ha&s;tened my expedition to England; I reached Che&s;ter at a time when Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> had brought an excellent company to that city, knowing &s;e|veral of the members, and wi&s;hing to know others, I pro|tracted my journey a matter of three months, which pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly and rationally, &s;ave too great expence, lo&s;s of time, and a near chance of matrimony, which would then have been peculiarly indi&s;creet. One leading defect of my di&s;po&s;ition has been procra&s;tination, which has operated mo&s;t powerfully; however I was not totally idle, for during my &s;tay I altered <HI>Ben John&s;on's Sejanus,</HI> which I &s;hall &s;peak of in future. Ju&s;t previous to &s;etting off for London, Mr. <HI>Derrick,</HI> another early acquaintance, pur&s;ued my &s;teps, not liking the avocation he was placed to, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a linen-draper; very bare of ca&s;h, and little acquainted, I was obliged to &s;tand forth for him, which I had great plea&s;ure in doing.</P>
<P>Soon after coming to London, for &s;ake of better air, I took lodgings at Richmond, Mr. <HI>Derrick</HI> remained with me there near a year, and was mo&s;t of the time u&s;ing his admirable talents for pu&s;hing into an exten&s;ive acquaintance, while I, waited with philo&s;ophic patience, tho' not proper oeconomy,

<P>During my &s;tay at Richmond I publi&s;hed the alteration of <HI>John&s;on's Sejanus,</HI> and from a connection my father had with the <HI>Orrery</HI> family, I dedicated it to the late Earl <HI>John,</HI> who&s;e literary abilities, and extreme liberal turn of mind, reflected honour on nobility, and even on the name of <HI>Boyle</HI>; being ever of a di&s;tant nature in matters of this &s;ort, I referred pre&s;entation of the copy to Mr. <HI>Derrick,</HI> who never was better plea&s;ed than when employed in this manner; he brought me a verbal account that my piece was politely received, and that his Lord&s;hip wi&s;hed to &s;ee me at his hou&s;e, then in Leice&s;ter-fields; I obeyed the &s;ummons, and never experienced more affability or good &s;en&s;e than at this interview: he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay that I had given <HI>&s;ome</HI> marks of genius, but feared, if I &s;hould in future &s;hew <HI>much improved</HI> abilities, they would be but of little advantage, for (as he emphatically ob&s;erved) the fountain-head of critical ta&s;te was frozen and benumbed; if you have a turn for politics, continues his Lord&s;hip, and will pro&s;titute principle to profit, either for or again&s;t admini&s;tra|tion, &s;ome lucrative con&s;equences will doubtle&s;s en&s;ue; but if you are an hone&s;t principled writer, ten to one but <HI>laudatur &amp; alget</HI> is a proper motto for you: how far I have found this veri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied I won't pretend to &s;ay, but heartily wi&s;h I had been fated to u&s;e an awl and end &s;ooner than the pen, for nothing but a pen&s;ioned defender of government, a &s;ycophant to ma|nagers, or a &s;lave to book&s;ellers, can do any thing more than crawl.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto a cordial epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence. A little after this period, I was &s;aluted with an account that my legacy was ar|rived and payable; but how was I &s;urprized to find, that three <HI>hone&s;t</HI> lawyers here, had, upon peru&s;ing my uncle's will, ex|plained away 600l. out of the 800l. I expected; this di&s;a|greeable &s;troke precipitated me into fre&s;h di&s;&s;ipation, which &s;hortly narrowed my circum&s;tances much, and occa&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed me to accept an engagement for Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on's</HI> theatre at Bath.</P>
<P>Before my expedition thither (under the gothic management of one Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI>'s, an old theatrical coxcomb, vain of play|ing, and covetous of money) I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee both town hou&s;es in a very reputable &s;tate of performance; but as to tragedy (&s;ave &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s peculiar parts, if I may &s;o &s;peak) Covent-garden was much &s;uperior, in comedy Drury-lane claimed manife&s;t precedence; there never was a more ma&s;terly performance than <HI>Every Man in his Humour,</HI> from <HI>Kitely</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;h,</HI> every part was &s;upported with a proportional degree of plea&s;ant propriety.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op,</HI> who had reached the Engli&s;h &s;tage, had the Dublin audiences approbation cordially, therefore e&s;&s;entially confirmed here; yet though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed undoubted merit, &s;ome &s;hare of what may be &s;tiled good fortune, attended him in both places, for what the Iri&s;h <HI>Collegians</HI> began with, animation, the London <HI>Templars</HI> fini&s;hed with zeal; would he had been as friendly to him&s;elf as the public was to his endeavours. Here, as in Dublin, too much ill-concerted expence attended his pride, yet I cannot recollect his circum&s;tances were, at this period, &s;o much reduced as tho&s;e of &s;ome other &s;ucce&s;sful knights-errant of the &s;tage I have known; no intimacy pre|vailed between us, con&s;iderably owing, I believe, to my rigid remembrance of his &s;udden contemptible exaltation of deport|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and unfriendly preci&s;ion of conver&s;ation, below the idea of a liberal education, and much more &s;o of a liberal mind; however, before leaving town, I paid him a compli|mentary vi&s;it, when he wi&s;hed me, and I believe with friendly meaning, all po&s;&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When arrived at <HI>Bath,</HI> where the campaign was begun, I found a very imperfect odd jumbled crew, and according to many of the undertakings <HI>I</HI> was forced upon, mo&s;t of my en|deavours only tended to make the groupe more ridiculous; for being chiefly in a much varied capital line, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been often capitally wrong; however, in the mo&s;t unju&s;|tifiable attempts, I always met with forbearance, without the aid of a &s;ingle puff, or any &s;upport from per&s;onal acquaint|ances, for I neither &s;ought, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> obtained, above twelve during eight months re&s;idence, multiplicity of acquaintance, and e&s;|pecially upon an intere&s;ted plan, I ever de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>

<P>The &s;econd &s;ea&s;on I produced <HI>Zaphira,</HI> a tragedy, on the &s;ame &s;tory of Dr. <HI>Brown's Barbaro&s;&s;a,</HI> but performed before that gentleman's piece came out at <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> it was better repre&s;ented, and better received than the <HI>Sultan,</HI> though with le&s;s profit to me. The &s;ame &s;ea&s;on I fitted up an alteration of <HI>Shake&s;peare's Richard</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> which, though incumbered with too many characters of importance, to be adequately &s;up|ported by a country company (for &s;uch <HI>Bath</HI> might then be called) was al&s;o very well received; indeed the performance of one Mi&s;s <HI>Ibbot,</HI> the be&s;t <HI>declamatory</HI> actre&s;s I ever heard, contributed much to the piece's reputation. The manu&s;cripts of the&s;e two tragedies have, I know not how, been purloined from me.</P>
<P>During &s;ummer, between the &s;econd and third &s;ea&s;ons at <HI>Bath,</HI> I came to <HI>London,</HI> and found Mr. <HI>Derrick</HI> &s;tudying law and practical philo&s;ophy in that agreeable academy the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, where his &s;ituation would have been painfully exigent, had not the late Sir <HI>Francis Delaval,</HI> Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> a Dr. <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> and, through their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, other gentlemen, liberally &s;ub&s;cribed for his &s;upport, the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns of which was placed in Mr. <HI>Vail|la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>'s hands, from whom he received it weekly.</P>

Several theatrical manoeuvres were practi&s;ed to make me unea&s;y, but finding me vulnerable only thro' the &s;ides of my friends, I was &s;o clo&s;ely attacked that way, that an entire breach en&s;ued; and at the end of the &s;ea&s;on I parted with the managers, as they &s;tiled them|&s;elves, on terms not the mo&s;t polite, however I was well plea&s;|ed to get rid of &s;uch a di&s;agreeable &s;huffling connection, and wi&s;hing to &s;ee <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> a city I had heard much of, I went thither without any public view.</P>

<P>Hence Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Barry</HI> and <HI>Woodward</HI> who had money to lo&s;e, lo&s;t it; and my old &s;chool-fellow, who had little more than public merit and private character to &s;acrifice, impaired both very much. During the greate&s;t part of his mock monarchy he was but ruler of a crew not much above the mendicant tribe; if he had pompous dre&s;&s;es for him&s;elf, an unlimited round of characters, &s;ome quality acquaintance, (who &s;tripped him of more by private gaming than they &s;erved him in pub|lic) and the free exerci&s;e of his own infallible opinion he was happy, though hourly &s;olicited by &s;tarving actors, and daily watched by keen-&s;cented bailiffs; he pro&s;tituted native hone&s;ty, which I am &s;ure he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to in&s;uperable pride and im|moveable ob&s;tinacy. When the di&s;po&s;al of parts was in his own power, thinking the <HI>king's</HI> name a <HI>tower of defence,</HI> he undertook as many things out of his way as he did in it, hence, in the general view, he re&s;embled a man who wears a &s;uit of cloaths of contra&s;t materials, look at his right &s;ide he is velvet and elegance, turn to his left, he is coar&s;e frize, which tho' warm and convenient is offen&s;ively mi&s;placed.</P>
<P>For &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons this unhappy, and in the main, <HI>great</HI> man, maintained painful, unprofitable, and perturbed authority; he was all through an entire &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, and mo&s;t part of the time a pri&s;oner to his circum&s;tances; and he who thought one half, if not all mankind, beneath him, could, for occa&s;ional forbearance, bribe and truckle to the mo&s;t con|temptible ra&s;cally &s;et of the human &s;pecies&mdash;need the word <HI>bailiffs</HI> be added</P>

<P>My next trip from <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> was to join a company, as it was called, of kidnapped comedians, picked up from <HI>London, Dublin,</HI> &amp;c. led by one <HI>Bardin,</HI> a noted adventurer, who, without any con&s;ent obtained from the magi&s;trates, mo&s;t igno|rantly and impudently intruded him&s;elf and unhappy Co. upon the town of <HI>Liverpool</HI>; where the <HI>wi&s;e Mayor</HI> had, at that time, conceived a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> prejudice again&s;t theatrical perform|ances, why or wherefore he knew not, but power is power however u&s;ed. A &s;et of people, who innocent with regard to their general intentions, were decoyed there by threats of pro|&s;ecution, curiou&s;ly fabricated in the chicanery of law; the per|formers were not only intimidated, but their finances were &s;o much reduced, that they neither knew how to return, or how to &s;tay upon <HI>hone&s;t</HI> principles; indeed, I believe two or three were capable of <HI>any</HI> retreat, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the la&s;t-mentioned ingredient.</P>
<P>The principle of &s;elf-defence, in the fir&s;t place, and a &s;o|cial concern for per&s;ons trepanned into a premunire, made me &s;trike out a rational eva&s;ion of that childi&s;h, or rancorous law, which makes that in common pro&s;ecutable, which a <HI>Royal Patent</HI> can &s;anctify; my &s;cheme was, to &s;tile, and to occupy the <HI>theatre</HI> as a &s;chool of <HI>Oratory,</HI> for the explanation of moral and practical philo&s;ophy, both according to the ancients and moderns; to render this plau&s;ible, and indeed incontroverti|ble, as to both law, equity, and common &s;en&s;e, I gave before each of the pieces, a &s;hort introductory lecture upon the ge|neral &s;ubject and tendency of the play; a point not ami&s;s to be practi&s;ed here, in&s;tead of farcical unmeaning prologues.</P>

<P>From this mingled &s;cene of laughter and woe I went to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> where I again met Mr. <HI>Whitley</HI>; having &s;everal cor|dial and re&s;pectable friends in the city, I re&s;olved to pa&s;s &s;ome time there as a private vi&s;iter.

merit to him, warning them of his &s;ituation, as I never cho&s;e nor ever will be a kidnapper in any &s;hape; his being arre&s;ted put an end to the negociation. Two days before he got into <HI>&s;alva cu&s;todia</HI> (a circum&s;tance I very &s;incerely lamented) in a <HI>tete a tete,</HI> I a&s;ked him why he did not clo&s;e with one hou&s;e or the other <HI>here?</HI> he ob&s;erved that Mrs. <HI>Yates</HI> was the only thea|trical lady who could play con&s;onantly with him, that &s;he was then at <HI>Covent-garden,</HI> and as there was a <HI>particular</HI> rea&s;on why he could not properly be where Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> was manager (the rea&s;on I don't chu&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elate) he was indifferent about en|gaging: I then &s;ugge&s;ted his obtaining, which he certainly might have done, licence for &s;ix nights at Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s, after the &s;ea&s;on, by which I told him he might at lea&s;t get 500l. and if his original powers remained, by pre&s;enting him&s;elf to public view, might oblige the managers of either hou&s;e to com|ply with his terms.</P>
<P>Whether con&s;cious of that natural inward decay, I plainly &s;aw, or rather more plainly heard, or whether through native pride, he replied thus,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"old &s;chool-fellow and friend, I would not appear at Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s theatre in <HI>London</HI> to clear 1000l. in the time you mention."</Q>
&mdash;here is a great light thrown on character. After the circum&s;tance of his bank|ruptcy I &s;aw him not, but heard that he pa&s;&s;ed his time depen|dantly in the &s;outh of <HI>France</HI>&mdash;di&s;mal &s;ituation for a proud man! when he returned here I know not, nor did I know of his precipitate decline, however of his penury and ob&s;cure death I painfully heard too &s;oon; Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> I am in|formed, offered to bury him, but an <HI>uncle,</HI> mo&s;t generou&s;ly, took that enormous ta&s;k to him&s;elf. Here we place to re&s;t an actor of as great natural powers as ever graced the &s;tage for tragedy, and as great defects as ever ca&s;t a damp on merit even in that &s;tile&mdash;&s;hall we, in oppo&s;ition to that charitable maxim, <HI>de mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum,</HI> enter a little into private character, as I wi&s;h to be done by my&s;elf, &s;o will I do in this ca&s;e, with truth and brevity.</P>
<P>As a &s;chool-boy he was diligent in &s;tudy, good-natured, and &s;trictly hone&s;t, but rather ab&s;tracted; as a member of the college he was tolerably oeconomical, free from debauchery and equally attentive as at &s;chool; tran&s;planted to the &s;tage he almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly grew &s;elf-&s;ufficient and arrogant, having very little money to command before, and ru&s;hing into what I may call a profu&s;ion for him, he forgot not only h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s early friends but even him&s;elf, was in &s;hort a Ba&s;haw off as well as on the &s;tage; on coming to <HI>London</HI> his arrogance rather abated, but &s;ucce&s;s &s;till cheri&s;hed pride.</P>
<P>As to his connections with the female &s;ex I will &s;ay no more than this, that at the age of eighteen he had, as far as I could judge, a ju&s;t and generous idea of their influence; but com|mencing
<PB N="24" REF="26">
a great man he was intimidated at marriage, fearing any inva&s;ion of lordly rule; however, by credible informa+tions he was a dupe to artful females, e&s;pecially an old noble lady in <HI>Dublin,</HI> who u&s;ed to make a tolerable audience for her <HI>dear Harry,</HI> as &s;he &s;tiled him, and after the play &s;tripped him at her route of twice what her intere&s;t had procured; thus &s;tarving actors were deprived of their &s;alaries, and the daped imperious manager was worn out of all circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Of his management it may be &s;aid, he never con&s;ulted any thing but &s;elf, not &s;o much for gain as &s;elfi&s;h vanity; from the whole it may be collected that he had original integrity &s;trongly planted in his brea&s;t, that he was by nature a gentleman, by opportunity and a&s;&s;iduity a &s;cholar, by uncommon requi&s;ites a great actor, and by particular failings a very reprehen&s;ible man; I arde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly wi&s;h to ca&s;t a veil over the dark &s;hades, but as I profe&s;s my&s;elf real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y an enthu&s;ia&s;t of impartiality, I cannot di&s;gui&s;e or varni&s;h; that &s;o little re&s;pect was paid by the thea|trical word to &s;uch an ornament is a reproach to the communi|ties of both hou&s;es, &s;ave tho&s;e who attended; but he who lived rich in abilities, went to the grave poor in commemoration, very little con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quence to the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, but &s;hameful to the living.</P>

<P>I promi&s;ed to give &s;ome light into the <HI>managerical</HI> artifice in making actors &s;o exceedingly ridiculous and metamorpho&s;able; an actor <HI>really</HI> capital is mi&s;&s;ed by the audience, and therefore will have adequate terms, without being under &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjec|tion to the manager; if therefore an hungry appetite for &s;ee|ing plays, however mangled, prevails through the public, and a man for &s;even or eight pounds per week is &s;ent on to bungle through principal parts, which, properly &s;u&s;tained, would de&s;erve twice that &s;um, &s;o much is really, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be, &s;aved; be&s;ides a <HI>&s;top-gap</HI> of this kind, &s;hould he a&s;&s;ume any importance, is immediately removed, becau&s;e next ours may &s;ucceed him without any public complaint; thus actors and audiences are brought effectually into the gripe of pattentees.</P>

<P>I could point out a number of faults in decorum and enun|ciation, but pre&s;uming I &s;hall be deemed rather &s;evere for &s;ay|ing &s;o much as I have done, I &s;hall contract my&s;elf on the&s;e points, and only ob&s;erve, that in re&s;pect of the former, I have frequently and lately, &s;een the &s;ide wings of a chamber con|tinued three or four minutes through a grove, a garden &s;cene, &amp;c.

<P>In point of enunciation the blunders are innumerable, and as to empha&s;is the mi&s;application incredible, take one in&s;tance for all; from head to foot it is now become fa&s;hionable, if the words <HI>thou</HI> or <HI>thy</HI> are uttered, to mark them &s;trongly without

any doubt of meaning; as for in&s;tance, our pre&s;ent tragedy orators, in &s;aying, give me thy hand, though no hand but one is meant, childi&s;hly, or rather pedantically, pronounce <HI>thy</HI> hand&mdash;<HI>thou</HI> art a villain; this, without compari&s;on, &s;hould be directly oppo&s;ite, thou art a <HI>villain</HI>; but the&s;e, and many other e&s;&s;entials, are below the notice of all accompli&s;hed in|fallible performers, who are as repugnant to the tickling of critici&s;m, as a country girl to the approaches of her lover in early hours of cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hip.</P>
<P>Action, one mo&s;t graceful and expletive ornament, is al|mo&s;t totally neglected as to correctne&s;s; a needle&s;s extrava|gant mi&s;placed expan&s;ion of arms, is &s;ub&s;tituted for that de|&s;criptive and impre&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of limbs, which renders the meaning more obvious and delights the view; if the wings of a paper kite (an emblem of &s;ome arms on the &s;tage) did not move &s;o invariably, even they would be more diverting.</P>

<P><HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> I have already mentioned as a place of opulence, affability, and &s;pirit, the upper cla&s;s are not very keen, yet they are very &s;en&s;ible and very candid critics; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y would rather prai&s;e than fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fault, yet they expect &s;omewhat more than bare decency; attention is the chiefe&s;t put of their ap|plau&s;e, and indeed the be&s;t any audience can give; <HI>that</HI> can|not be obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by puffing; the lower cla&s;s, freed from their indu&s;trious avocations, are willing to receive relaxation in the mo&s;t agreeable manner.</P>
<P>At <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> having had many excellent companies from <HI>London,</HI> and many of the inhabitants going frequently to <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> there is a capricious opinion prevails, and they are rather to be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken with a Theatre Royal name, than real merit with|out that very honourable addition; there is much politene&s;s,

ho&s;pitality, and friend&s;hip in this city, but too much affecta|tion in their critici&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>York</HI> is good-naturedly dull; audiences there are remarkable for fixing public regard on individuals, whom they pronounce incomparable; they are a kind of parents to &s;uch actors, and maintain them from youth to grey hairs, even again&s;t judge|ment; private character, much to the city's honour, is pecu|liarly con&s;idered, and, when good, is &s;ure to be patronized. Mr. <HI>Wilkin&s;on,</HI> the pre&s;ent pattentee, has given, in a few years, much &s;pirit both to the theatre, performers and frequenters of it.</P>
<P>Thus much for the &s;tage&mdash;My &s;chool fellows <HI>Deuter</HI> and <HI>Derrick</HI> paid the debt of nature under the age of thirty; the former was placid in public and private life, gave no particu|lar offence or plea&s;ure on or off the &s;tage; he was liberal, a gentleman, and a &s;cholar; an unhappy matrimonal connec|tion breaking his temper broke his heart.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Derrick,</HI> when a&s;toni&s;hingly cho&s;en ma&s;ter of the cere|monies at <HI>Bath,</HI> without a &s;ingle requi&s;ite for the place, pro|mi&s;ed a grateful return, and actually began to make it; but being involved among&s;t ladies of ea&s;y virtue, he &s;oon forgot his friend, and &s;acrificed his unhappy life to the &s;hrine of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>As to my&s;elf I am &s;till &s;crambling on the &s;urface of exi&s;tence, "with more offences at my beck, &amp;c." as to them let &s;ome future commemorator &s;et them down, and, <HI>if</HI> I have any good qualities, join them; from my heart I wi&s;h to be treated with the &s;ame hone&s;t veritable freedom with which I have treated others; if anatomizing my mind, even while living, and ana|tomizing my body when dead, can render any public u&s;e, I freely &s;ub&s;cribe to both; one favourable circum&s;tance only, I &s;hall advance, and venture to maintain, that I would in no ca&s;e, nor upon any view, flatter a monarch, or in&s;ult a beg|gar.</P>

<P>HAVE you deliver'd the cards as I order'd?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir&mdash;but the one for Lady Brainle&s;s could hardly gain admittance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that formal cautious dome&s;tic, Mr. Timothy, &s;aid he would introduce me to his ma&s;ter, but that honour, from a knowledge of Sir Barnaby, I prudently declin'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what rea&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, Sir, I have no great affection for brui&s;ed fle&s;h, or broken bones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! a pretty fellow for a &s;oldier, truly, to be afraid of a feeble old citizen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, you dont know the force and ac|tivity of his crab-tree crutch; be&s;ides, this love &s;ilences every other con&s;ideration; and runs us into as many hazards as war&mdash;do you forget our mid|night adventure, when the great tan-yard dog ea&s;ed your coat of a &s;kirt, and was very near pruning my body of a leg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="36">
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the better, as in war &s;o in love, dangers and difficulties beget glory and plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely, Sir, but to hazard life and limb without hopes of a pen&s;ion, is to be mere knights-errant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience and per&s;everance may gain a pen+&s;ion beyond thy utmo&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Sir, you &s;peak to the purpo&s;e; and I hope your honour wont think me the wor&s;e &s;ervant for having an eye to the main chance; as every day &s;hows us that intere&s;t rules all ranks, from the ge|neral to the centinel; from the dutche&s;s to the chamber-maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and you have a right to all the favour I can &s;how, for re&s;cuing me from tho&s;e whi&s;ker'd hu&s;&s;ars at Warbourg:&mdash;what think you therefore of being provided with a good wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a good fortune too, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly: &s;uppo&s;e Sir Scrapeall's &s;i&s;ter, old mother Bu&s;y?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a &s;ad &s;uppo&s;ition, too Sir, I think, for if &s;he had lived in Scotland, &s;ome century ago, her looks would have brought her to the faggot for a witch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I &s;uppo&s;e nothing will go down with you but the ro&s;es and lillies of youth? don't you know, num&s;cull, that beauty is one of the mo&s;t fading and peri&s;hable commodities in the world? now old Bu&s;y, having received mo&s;t of the injuries that time can do human nature, will be as engag|ing at la&s;t as at fir&s;t: be&s;ides, you need not fear a rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>Really I believe not, Sir, unle&s;s the devil him&s;elf turns gallant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;he has five hundred a year jointure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>Has &s;he &s;o, Sir? that makes a very great alteration, why &s;he is not half &s;o di&s;agreeable as &s;he was&mdash;your honour's humble &s;ervant is not &s;o nice,
<PB N="3" REF="37">
but he can find ro&s;es and lillies in the &s;olemn hue of old gold, and the harmony of the &s;pheres from chinking of guinea; sbut, Sir, there's one rub &s;till, if I &s;hould make prize of this old crazy galleon, I mu&s;t try to keep her above water, as the cargo is to &s;ink with her; if I could but keep the gold, and &s;end her to the bottom, it would be making a good crui&s;e of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant &s;he has an old che&s;t that will afford good &s;poil, and I have no doubt of your &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, I mu&s;t be a dull &s;cholar, indeed, not to have learned from you how to tickle female ears; and the view of a &s;nug retreat, will make me encounter wrinkled cheeks, &s;unk eyes, tooth|le&s;s gums, and grey hairs, with as much alacrity as if youth and beauty were the prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>On that will depend your &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;mother Sly &s;hall prepare the way for a proper introduction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir; there's another rub we had like to forget&mdash;your honour knows that I have been forced to make &s;ome advances to Mrs. Ruelle, Lady Brainle&s;s's woman; now what &s;hall I do to quiet her? &s;he is a good friend, and may be a bitter foe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well ob&s;erved, &s;he is a nece&s;&s;ary agent, and mu&s;t not be lo&s;t; &s;hould &s;he know you in your di&s;gui&s;e, you mu&s;t have recour&s;e to your old method of lying; and if that won't prevail, my pur&s;e &s;hall produce &s;ome irre&s;i&s;table arguments; &s;he is a politic jade, and &s;eems to know the value of a few guineas extremely well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fu&s;ee</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, I believe &s;he does, Sir, and tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a nimble tongue, can always be &s;ilent when intere&s;t tips her the wink.</P>
</SP>

<STAGE><PB N="4" REF="38">ENTER SIR CHARLES PRUDENT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, good-morrow, is not my vi&s;it unfa&s;hionably early?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sir Charles; an agreeable com|panion can never come un&s;ea&s;onably, &s;ave a wench in the ca&s;e; as to fa&s;hion, &s;he is a capricious jade, and below the regard of a &s;en&s;ible man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? when no body, in ge|neral, pays a &s;tricter regard to her rules than my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>you mu&s;t not imagine that every cu&s;tom I conform to commands my approbation; but as peculiarities, however rational, are rather offen&s;ive to the general eye, why &s;hould a man render him|&s;elf di&s;agreeably wi&s;er than his neighbours; it is a peevi&s;h characteri&s;tic of age, to idolize the modes of its youth, for my part, I think revolutions in ta&s;te nece&s;&s;ary; and cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that either the morals, or under&s;tandings of mankind are in|jured by a &s;ocial conformity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly they are not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far then I am the voluntary &s;ubject, but never can become the &s;lave of fa&s;hion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be free, Colonel, does not this &s;en|&s;ible compliance proceed chiefly from the influence of the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confe&s;s the truth I believe it may; and among us &s;oldiers it is no more than duty; by our commi&s;&s;ions we are ranked under the banners of fame and beauty, to render the cau&s;e of the former &s;ervice, and the dictates of the latter obedience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>In which light, you have happily di&s;|tingui&s;hed your&s;elf; and if report &s;peaks true, the ladies have not prov'd in&s;en&s;ible to your merit; what fame may do&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gives me very little concern; &s;he is, an <HI>empty airy glittering bubble,</HI> as the &s;ong &s;ays; when <PB N="5" REF="39">
my country calls, my be&s;t endeavours are at her &s;ervice, but for a mi&s;tre&s;s, let me have warm fle&s;h and blood; lips to melt, and eyes to fire the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like tho&s;e of Emmeline Fairlove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, my friend; what were the glory of an Alexander to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch charms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere aerial phantoms but prithee Frank, has that lady had the power to touch your heart in reality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touch, why &s;he has &s;hot it through and through with Cupid's arrows; made a perfect riddle of it, and, notwith&s;tanding my love of freedom, I begin to think that matrimony alone can work its cure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! what the gay, gallant, and univer&s;al lover Colonel Parapet monopolized by a &s;ingle happy fair one? after all, my friend, I am afraid that roving, di&s;&s;ipated heart of thine will hardly bear limitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir Charles; when that limitation proceeds from choice; gallantry is a pretty agree|able amu&s;ement for &s;ome years, at a man's fir&s;t entrance into life; but like other light appendages of youth, &s;hould give place to more &s;erious enjoy|ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you have at la&s;t determin'd to become a grave, city-like fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that neither; a hu&s;band may have &s;pirit without running at large; and a wife gaiety with|out indi&s;cretion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Colonel, you have perfectly ex|pre&s;&s;ed pre&s;&s;ed my opinion; &s;hould one happy day give Lady Charlotte to my arms, and Emmeline to yours, I have no more to a&s;k of fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I; but you, my friend, have much the nearer pro&s;pect: however, fortune favours the bold; and having laid &s;iege I am determined to carry on my operations with vigour; could I but

&s;ecure the outworks I &s;hould have no doubt of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the outworks, I pre&s;ume, you mean Lady Brainle&s;s and the amiable Mrs. Bu&s;y?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right&mdash;and &s;ure no mortal had ever greater contra&s;t's to deal with; as to the for|mer, being young, hand&s;ome, &s;prightly, and good natured, it is not a di&s;agreeable point to flatter her vanity; but the old beldam is quite intolerable: however I have warm hopes of getting her off my hands immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what means?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you &s;hall know hereafter&mdash;the hour calls me at my agent's to &s;ign &s;ome accounts; if you'll take a place in my chariot, and accompany me thither, I &s;han't detain you above five minutes, then I am yours as you plea&s;e?</P>

<P>To her guardian's&mdash;to be &s;ure, my Lord&mdash; you honour me&mdash;but then, as I told your Lord|&s;hip, it is &s;uch a motley, unaccountable family, that you'll undoubtedly meet a very unpolite re|ception.</P>

<P>Why, my Lord, there's the old knight, made up of avarice, jealou&s;y, and rudene&s;s&mdash;his Lady, Emmeline's &s;i&s;ter, a &s;catter-brained piece of incon&s;i&s;tent affectation&mdash;</P>

<STAGE>SIR CHARLES and the COLONEL.</STAGE>
<P>DEAR Colonel, this unexpected rival of yours adds to my own perplexity; but from the idea I have of your mi&s;tre&s;s, I think your happi|ne&s;s in no danger.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>There it is; every man thinks his own ca&s;e wor&s;t; mi&s;chief on it, I am chiefly vexed, that after &s;uch experience I &s;hould let any attach|ment have power to perplex me&mdash;however I threw what objections I could in the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I gave as unfavourable an idea as I could of the family&mdash;nay, went &s;o far as to con|tradict my heart in regard of Emmeline's beauty and merit&mdash;but, Sir Charles, in my confu&s;ion I had forgot to tell you that Lady Charlotte's expe|dition into the country is upon a treaty of marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>A treaty of marriage! with who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That his Lord&s;hip did not particularize, but &s;aid the affair was &s;ettled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sdeath! it cannot be! what, after permitting my addre&s;&s;es with mo&s;t engaging con|de&s;cen&s;ion; after intimating I was not di&s;agreeable to her, and giving delicate hopes of a happy i&s;&s;ue; after all this to change without the &s;malle&s;t pretext of offence, or a&s;&s;igning the &s;lighte&s;t rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, my friend, it appears at pre&s;ent&mdash;you know the brother could not have any view, and he mentioned it with a tender &s;en&s;e of your di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My di&s;appointment! he &s;hould ra|ther have felt for his &s;i&s;ter's mo&s;t egregious fal&s;|hood
<PB N="48" REF="82">
&mdash;if &s;he has jilted me I'll expo&s;e her pub|lickly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Sir Charles, that revenge will light upon your&s;elf&mdash;fa&s;hion and &s;pirit will only laugh at your &s;incere ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I therefore tamely bear &s;uch an in&s;ult to my heart and affections? if I can't pre|vent the match I'll at lea&s;t render it as di&s;agreeable as may be; I'll take po&s;t for the Earl's tomorrow morning, lay my previous claim before him, up|braid her incon&s;tancy, and, if the new lover &s;hould have &s;pirit enough to appear, convince him I am not that commodious pa&s;&s;ive uten&s;il &s;he would make of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I applaud your re&s;olution; and if you have any occa&s;ion for an auxiliary &s;word you know where to find it: in the mean time I think you had better find Lord Frederic and receive fuller infor|mation from him; be&s;ides, if you can detain him for the evening it may be of &s;ingular &s;ervice to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>The latter motive alone is &s;ufficient to excite my diligence; for, re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, dear Colo|nel, that whatever my cro&s;s &s;tars de&s;ign for me, I heartily wi&s;h your affairs may feel the influence of a propitious planet.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
