<P>THE DEVIL UPON TWO STICKS; A COMEDY, IN THREE ACTS. AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL in the HAYMARKET. WRITTEN BY THE LATE SAMUEL FOOTE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> AND NOW PUBLISHED BY Mr. COLMAN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SOME copies of &s;purious impre&s;&s;ions of the Cozeners and the Maid of Bath, having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction, it has been thought advi&s;able, in vindication of the property of the Editor, as well as in ju&s;tice to the decea&s;ed Author, imme|diately to commit to the pre&s;s genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces above-mentioned, together with THIS COMEDY, which had been al&s;o without authority adverti&s;ed for publication.</P>
<P>On in&s;pection of the &s;purious impre&s;&s;ions, it appears, that all the errors of carele&s;s and igno|rant tran&s;cribers are there religiou&s;ly pre&s;erved; and all the additions and improvements, made by the facetious Writer, are omitted. Many in&s;tances of this will occur on peru&s;al of tho&s;e Comedies, and particularly the Cozeners; in which, be&s;ides the re&s;toration of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages always &s;poken on the &s;tage, the Reader will find a whole &s;cene, at the end of the Fir&s;t Act, and
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
another, &s;till more entertaining and popular, at the beginning of the Third; both which were wholly wanting in the &s;purious Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property, but commonly prove injurious to the publick: For the copies, being obtained by clande&s;tine and indirect means, are, for the mo&s;t part, as has happened in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, incorrect and imperfect.</P>

<STAGE>Enter Sir Thomas Maxwell and Margaret.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY, the woman is mad! the&s;e curs'd news-paper patriots have &s;hatter'd her brains! nothing le&s;s than a &s;enator of &s;even years &s;tanding can conceive what &s;he means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir Thomas, my conver&s;ation is neither deficient in order, preci&s;ion, or dignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dignity! and what occa&s;ion for dignity in tne common concerns of my hou&s;e? why the deuce can't you conver&s;e like the re&s;t of the world? If you want money to pay off my bills, you move me for further &s;upplies; if I turn away a
<PB N="2" REF="7">
&s;ervant, you condemn me for &s;o often changing my mini&s;try; and becau&s;e I lock up my daugh|ter, to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader, it is for&s;ooth an inva&s;ion of the Bill of Rights, and a mortal &s;tab to the great Charter of Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>As Serjeant Second'em &s;aid in the debate on the corn-bill, <Q>Then why don't you chu&s;e better ground, brother, and learn to enlarge your bottom a little? Con&s;ider, you mu&s;t draw the line of liberty &s;omewhere; for if the&s;e rights belong</Q>&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But indeed, my dear brother, you are got quite out of your depth: Woman, I tell you, is a microco&s;m, and rightly to rule her requires as great talents, as to govern a &s;tate. And what &s;ays the Aphori&s;m of Cardinal Polignac? <Q>If you would not have a per&s;on deceive you, be careful not to let him know you mi&s;tru&s;t him!</Q> and &s;o of your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Margaret Maxwell, be&s;tow your advice where it is wanted! Out of my depth? a likely &s;tory indeed, that I, who am fix'd here in a national tru&s;t, appointed guardian of the Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t at the court of Madrid, &s;hould not know how to manage a girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Mr. Con&s;ul, what informa|tion
<PB N="3" REF="8">
will your &s;tation afford you? I don't deny your knowledge in export and import, nor doubt your &s;kill in the difference between wet and dry goods; you may weigh with exactne&s;s the bal|lance of trade, or explain the true &s;pirit of a treaty of commerce; the &s;urface, the mere &s;kimmings of the political pot!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had you, with me, traced things to their original &s;ource; had you di&s;cover'd all &s;ocial &s;ubordination to ari&s;e from original compact; had you read Machiavel, Monte&s;quieu, Locke, Bacon, Hobbes, Harrington, Hume; had you &s;tudied the political te&s;taments of Alberoni and Cardinal Richlieu&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you analiz'd the Pragmatic Sanc|tion, and the family-compact; had you toil'd thro' the laborious page of the Vinerian profe&s;&s;or, or e&s;ti|mated the prevailing manners with the Vicar of Newca&s;tle; in a word, had you read Amicus upon Taxation, and Inimicus upon Repre&s;enta|tion, you would have known&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, in &s;pite of the frippery French Salick laws, woman is a free agent, a noun &s;ub&s;tantive entity, and, when treated with con|fidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, perhaps, &s;he may not abu&s;e it: But &s;till, my &s;age &s;i&s;ter, it is but a <HI>perhaps</HI>; now my method is certain, infallible; by confining her, I can't be deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what right have you to confine her? look in your Puffendorff! tho' born in Spain, &s;he is a native of England; her birth-right is liberty&mdash;a better patrimonial e&s;tate than any of your de&s;potic countries could give her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zooks, you would tire the patience of Job! Pray an&s;wer me this; is Harriet my daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then? for that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing &s;he is not beholden to you; nor can you, tho' a father, with rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, or law, take it from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Margaret, you forget where you are! This, child, is the town of Madrid; you are among&s;t a &s;age, &s;teady people, who know and revere the natural rights of a parent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Natural rights! Can a right to tyran|nize be founded in nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'ee, Margaret! you are but lo&s;ing your time; for unle&s;s you can prevail on Count Wall, or the pre&s;ident of Ca&s;tille, to grant you a Habeas, why Harriet &s;hall &s;tay where &s;he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, you know where you are; but,
<PB N="5" REF="10">
if my niece will take my advice, the ju&s;tice that is denied to her here, &s;he will in&s;tantly &s;eek for el&s;ewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>El&s;ewhere? hark you, &s;i&s;ter! is it thus you an&s;wer my purpo&s;e in bringing you hither? I hop'd to have my daughter's principles form'd by your prudence; her conduct directed by your ex|perience and wi&s;dom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>The preliminary is categorically true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why don't you abide by the treaty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; you have given me powerful motives!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But another word, madam! as I don't chu&s;e that Harriet &s;hould imbibe any more of your romantic republican notions, I &s;hall take it as a great favour if you would prepare to quit this country with the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not have remon&s;trated; a peti|tion would have an&s;wered your purpo&s;e: I did in|tend to withdraw, and without taking leave; nor will I re&s;ide on a &s;pot where the great charter of my &s;ex is hourly invaded! No, Sir Thomas, I &s;hall re|turn to the land of liberty! but there expect to have your de&s;potic dealings properly and publickly handled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you de&s;ign to turn author?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no occa&s;ion for that; liberty has already a champion in one of my &s;ex: The &s;ame
<PB N="6" REF="11">
pen that has dar'd to &s;courge the arbitrary actions of &s;ome of our monarchs, &s;hall do equal ju&s;tice to the oppre&s;&s;ive power of parents!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may, perhaps, be too late to get you into the hi&s;torical text; but, I promi&s;e you, you &s;hall be &s;oundly &s;winged in the marginal note.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter a Servant, who whi&s;pers Sir Thomas.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a ladder of ropes, dropped, I &s;uppo&s;e, by Mi&s;s Harriet from the balcony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>That way, I reckon, he thinks to retreat; but I &s;hall prevent him! Here, Dick, do you and Ralph run into the &s;treet, and front the hou&s;e with a couple of carbines; bid James bring my toledo; and let the re&s;t of the fel|lows follow my &s;teps!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-day! what can be the meaning of this civil commotion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing extraordinary; only the natural con&s;equence of &s;ome of your &s;alutary &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>

<P>Mine, Sir Thomas?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did? mighty well, madam! I hope then, for once, you will approve my proceedings; the law of nations &s;hall be &s;trictly ob&s;erved; you &s;hall &s;ee how a &s;py ought to be treated, who is caught in the enemy's camp!</P>

<P>None: He is, both from nature and habit, inflexibly ob&s;tinate.

<P>Not at all. Why, Sir, when matters grew de&s;perate, and the ca&s;e was given over for lo&s;t, little Belzy &s;tarts up in the form of an able practitioner, and humbly conceived, that his client could not be convicted upon that indictment; fora&s;much as therein he was charg'd with for&s;wearing him&s;elf NOW; whereas it clearly appeared, by the evidence, that he had only for&s;worn him&s;elf THEN: If, indeed, he had been indicted generally, for committing perjury <HI>now</HI> AND <HI>then,</HI> proofs might be produced of any perjury he may have committed; whereas, by limiting the point of time to the <HI>now,</HI> no proofs could be admitted as to the <HI>then</HI>: So that, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he humbly conceived, his client was clearly ab&s;olved, and his character as fair and as &s;potle&s;s as a babe that's ju&s;t born, and immaculate as a &s;heet of white paper.</P>

<P>A truce to your compliments! Tho' they are the common change of the world, we know of what ba&s;e metal the coin is compo&s;ed,
<PB N="26" REF="31">
and have cried down the currency: Speak your wi&s;hes at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>England, Sir, is our country, it is true; but Mi&s;s Maxwell being born abroad, and my leaving it young, have made us both as much &s;trangers to its manners and cu&s;toms, as if you had &s;et us down at I&s;pahan or Delhi: Give us, then, &s;ome little knowledge of the people with whom we are to live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That ta&s;k, young gentleman, is too much even for the Devil him&s;elf! Where liberty reigns, and property is pretty equally &s;pread, indepen|dence and pride will give each individual a pecu|liar and &s;eparate character: When cla&s;&s;ed in pro|fe&s;&s;ions, indeed, they then wear &s;ome &s;ingular marks that di&s;tingui&s;h them from the re&s;t of their race; the&s;e it may be nece&s;&s;ary for you to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will highly oblige me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And at the &s;ame time that I am &s;hewing you per&s;ons, I will give you &s;ome little light into things. Health and property you know are the two important objects of human attention: You &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ee their &s;tate and &s;ituation in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean the practice of phy&s;ick and law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. And as to the fir&s;t, you will find it, in &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ors, a &s;cience, noble, &s;alu|tary, and liberal; in others, a trade, as mean as it is mercenary; a contemptible combination of
<PB N="27" REF="32">
dunces, nur&s;es, and apothecaries: But you have now a lucky opportunity of knowing more in an hour of the great improvements in this branch of civil &s;ociety, than, by any other means, &s;even years could have taught you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain, if you plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;pirit of Di&s;cord prevails: The republic of tied periwigs, like the Romans of old, have turned their arms from the re&s;t of man|kind, to draw their &s;hort &s;words on them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came this about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To carry on the metaphor, you mu&s;t know, in this great town, there are two corps of the&s;e troops, equally numerous, and equally for|midable: The fir&s;t, it is true, are di&s;ciplined, and fight under a general, whom they chri&s;ten a Pre|&s;ident: The &s;econd contains the hu&s;&s;ars, and pan|dours of phy&s;ick; they rarely attack a patient to|gether; not but the latter &s;ingle-handed can do good execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But their cau&s;e of contention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pride. The light troops are jealous of &s;ome honours the others po&s;&s;e&s;s by pre&s;cription, and, though but a militia, think they have right to an equal rank with the regulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this in time may ruin their &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but that we mu&s;t prevent; it is our intere&s;t to make up this breach: Already we
<PB N="28" REF="33">
feel the fatal effects of their feuds: By neglecting their patients, the weekly bills daily decline, and new &s;ubjects begin to grow &s;carce in our realms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>This does, indeed, claim your attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>We purpo&s;e to call in the aid of the law; bleeding the pur&s;e is as effectual for damp|ing the &s;pirit, as opening a vein for lowering the pul&s;e: The Daemon of Litigation has already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Licentiates; I mu&s;t infu&s;e the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion into the Pre&s;ident; and I warrant you, in two or three terms, with two or three trials, all &s;ides will be heartily tired. But, a-propos! I &s;ee a brace of apothecaries coming this way; they &s;eem deep in debate: Let us li&s;ten; we &s;hall be&s;t learn from them the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of&mdash;Hu&s;h, hide!&mdash;You &s;hall here too have a proof what a Proteus I am. <STAGE>They retire.</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what can be done, Mr. Julep? Here Dr. Hellebore writes me word, that they threaten a &s;iege, and are provided with fire-arms: Would you have them &s;urrender the College at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fire-arms? If they are mad enough not
<PB N="29" REF="34">
to know that the pen is the doctor's be&s;t pi&s;tol, why, let them proceed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are we to &s;tand quietly by, and &s;ee the very &s;eat of the &s;cience demoli&s;hed and torn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with what arms are we to defend it? where are our cannon? We have mortars indeed, but then they are fit to hold nothing but pe&s;tles; and, as to our &s;mall arms, of what u&s;e can they be in a &s;iege? they are made, you know, to attack only the rear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Julep, you make too light of the&s;e matters: To have the lawful de&s;cendants from Galen, the throne of E&s;culapius, overturned by a parcel of Goths!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, Apozem, or treat your betters with proper re&s;pect! What, num&s;kull, do you think all phy&s;icians are blockheads, who have not wa&s;hed their hands in the Cam or the I&s;is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I hope you will allow that a univer&s;ity-doctor&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>May, for aught you know, be a dunce. Be&s;ides, fool, what have we to do with degrees? The doctor that do&s;es be&s;t is the be&s;t doctor for us. You talk of the College; there are &s;ome of their names, I am &s;ure, that I never de&s;ire to &s;ee on my file.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="35">
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed? no, indeed. Why, there's Dr. Diet, that makes &s;uch a du&s;t: He had a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, a patient of mine, under his care t'other day; as fine a &s;low fever! I was in hopes of half making my fortune&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I love a &s;low fever. Was it nervous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; with a lovely dejection of &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was delightful, indeed! I look upon the nerves and the bile to be the two be&s;t friends we have to our back.&mdash;Well, pray, and how did it an&s;wer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; the &s;coundrel let him &s;lip through my hands for a &s;ong; only a paltry &s;ix pounds and a crown.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shameful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infamous! and yet, for&s;ooth, he was one of your College. Well, now to &s;hew you the difference in men; but the very week after, Dr. Linctus, from Leyden, run me up a bill of thirty odd pounds, for only attending Alderman Soakpot &s;ix days in a &s;urfeit.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that was doing of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that's a &s;weet pretty practitioner, Apozem: We mu&s;t all do our utmo&s;t to pu&s;h him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt. But, notwith&s;tand|ing all that you &s;ay, Mr. Julep, there are &s;ome of the gentlemen of the College, that I know&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! as fine fellows as ever fingered a pul&s;e; not one of the trade will deny it.</P>

<P>But, among&s;t all now, old Nat Night|&s;hade is the man for my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Nat, Nat has merit, I own; but, pox take him! he is &s;o devili&s;h quick: To be &s;ure, he has a very pretty fluent pen whil&s;t it la&s;ts; but then he makes &s;uch di&s;patch, that one has hardly time to &s;end in two dozen of draughts.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the doctor drives on, to be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>

<P>Drives on! If I am at all free in the hou&s;e when old Night&s;hade is &s;ent for, as a pre|paratory do&s;e I always recommend an attorney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>An attorney? for what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make the patient's will, before he &s;wallows the doctor's pre&s;cription.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes; I generally afterwards get the thanks of the family.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julep.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true; but then you &s;hould never laugh loud in the &s;treet: We may indulge, indeed, a kind of &s;impering &s;mile to our patients, as we
<PB N="32" REF="37">
drive by in our chariots; but then there is a decency, not to &s;ay dignity, that becomes the publick dem&eacute;anour of us, who belong to the faculty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apozem.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. And yet there are times when one can hardly forbear: Why, t'other day now I had like to have bur&s;t: I was following a fune|ral into St. George's&mdash;a &s;weet pretty burying; velvet pall, hatband and gloves; and, indeed, the widow was quite hand&s;ome in all things; paid my bill the next week, without &s;concing off &s;ix|pence, though they were thought to have lived hap|pily together&mdash;but, as I was a-&s;aying, as we were entering the church, who &s;hould &s;tand in the porch but Kit Cabbage the taylor, with a new pair of breeches under his arm: The &s;ly rogue made me a bow, <Q REND="inline">"Servant, ma&s;ter Apozem!" &s;ays he; "what, you are carrying home your work too, I &s;ee."</Q> Did you ever hear &s;uch a dog?</P>

<P>The magician at Madrid has di&s;covered my flight; and recalls me by an irre&s;i&s;tible &s;pell: I mu&s;t leave you, my friends!</P>

<P>Forbid it, Fortune! it is now, Sir, that we mo&s;t want your aid.</P>

<P>You are in a country where your talents, with a little application, will procure you a provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>But which way to direct them?</P>

<P>Can you &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, after what I have &s;een&mdash;</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, I don't de&s;ign to engage you in any per&s;onal &s;ervice; I would only recommend it to you to be the vender of &s;ome of tho&s;e in|fallible remedies, with which our new&s;papers are con&s;tantly crouded?</P>

<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;ecret.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor they either: A few &s;imple waters,

dignified with titles that catch, no matter how wild and ab&s;urd, will effectually an&s;wer your purpo&s;e: As, let me &s;ee now! Tincture of Tinder, E&s;&s;ence of Egg&s;hell, or Bal&s;am of Broom&s;tick.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Sir; I can never &s;ubmit.</P>

<P>I think you are rather too &s;queami&s;h. What &s;ay you, then, to a little &s;piritual quackery?</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, there are in this town mounte|banks for the mind, as well as the body. How &s;hould you like mounting a cart on a common, and becoming a Methodi&s;t Preacher?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can that &s;cheme turn to account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing better: Believe me, the ab|&s;olute direction of the per&s;ons and pur&s;es of a large congregation, however low their conditions and callings, is by no means a contemptible object. I, for my own part, can &s;ay, what the Conqueror of Per&s;ia &s;aid to the Cynic; <Q>If I was not Alexander, I would be Diogenes:</Q> So, if I was not the Devil, I would chu&s;e to be a Methodi&s;t Preacher.</P>

<P>Simony! I don't comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simony, Sir, is a new kind of canon, devi&s;ed by the&s;e up&s;tart fanatics, that makes it &s;inful not to abu&s;e the confidence, and piou&s;ly plunder the little property, of an indigent man and his family.</P>

<P>A mo&s;t noble piece of ca&s;ui&s;tical cookery, and exceeds even the &s;ons of Ignatius! But this honour I mu&s;t beg to decline.</P>

<P>What think you then of trying the &s;tage? You are a couple of good theatrical figures; but how are your talents? can you &s;ing?</P>

<P>Oh, Mr. Invoice!&mdash;My father, Sir, as we &s;eldom went out, e&s;tabli&s;hed a dome&s;tic kind of drama, and made us perform &s;ome little mu&s;ical pieces, that were occa&s;ionally &s;ent us from England.</P>

<P>Exceedingly well! You have nothing to do now, but to offer your&s;elves to one of the hou&s;es.</P>

<P>And which, Sir, would you recommend?</P>

<P>Take your choice; for I can &s;erve you in neither.</P>
</SP>

<P>No? I thought, Sir, you told me ju&s;t now, that the &s;everal arts of the drama were under your direction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Devil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they were formerly; but now they are directed by the Genius of In&s;ipidity: He has entered into partner&s;hip with the managers of both hou&s;es, and they have &s;et up a kind of circulating library, for the vending of dialogue novels. I dare not go near the new hou&s;e, for the Daemon of Power, who gave me this lame|ne&s;s, has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the pates, and &s;own di&s;cord among the mock monarchs there; and what one receives, the other rejects. And as to the other hou&s;e, the manager has great merit him&s;elf, with &s;kill to di&s;cern, and candor to allow it in others; but I can be of no u&s;e in making your bargain, for in that he would be too many for the cunninge&s;t Devil among&s;t us.</P>
