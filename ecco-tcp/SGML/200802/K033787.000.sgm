<P>DRYDEN and PURCEL have made the following Performance hitherto regarded as one the be&s;t calculated to &s;hew the Effects of Poetry, Action, and Mu&s;ic. It is now &s;ub|mitted to the Public, with every Attention the Managers could give it.&mdash;The &s;ucce&s;s of this, as well as of all other Theatrical Exhibitions, will wholly depend upon the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te; but it is hoped, and believed, that the Names of Two of our greate&s;t Geniu&s;es in Poetry and Mu&s;ic, if they have Ju&s;tice done them upon the Stage, bid fair for public Approbation.&mdash;There are &s;ome &s;light Alterations made, for the greater Convenience of Repre&s;entation; and &s;ome few Songs added, where it was thought &s;uch Additions would be of Service to the whole.</P>
