<P>_YOU now, my dear friends, have before you this affecting &s;tory, as far as Dr. Bart|lett can give it. My cou&s;ins expre&s;s a good deal of concern for your Harriet: So does Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: So do my Lord and Lady L: And the more, as I &s;eem to carry off the matter with a&s;&s;umed bravery. This their kind concern for me looks, however, as if they thought me an hypocrite; and I &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that I act my part very aukwardly.</P>
<P>But, my dear, as this ca&s;e is one of tho&s;e few in which a woman <HI>can</HI> &s;hew a bravery of &s;pirit, I think an endeavour after it is laudable; and the rather, as in my conduct I aim at giving a tacit example to Mi&s;s Jervois.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The doctor has whi&s;per'd to me, that Lady Olivia is actually on her way to England; and that the intel|ligence Sir Charles received of her intention, was one of the things that di&s;turbed him, as the news of his beloved Signor Jeronymo's dangerous condition was another.</P>
<P>Lady Anne S. it &s;eems, has not yet given up her hopes of Sir Charles. The two &s;i&s;ters, who once favoured her above all the women they knew, have not been able to bring them&s;elves to acquaint a Lady of her rank, merit, and fortune, that there can be no hopes; and they are &s;till more loth to &s;ay, that their brother thinks them&s;elves under &s;ome obligation to a fo|reign lady. Yet you know that this was always what we were afraid of: But, who, now, will &s;ay <HI>afraid,</HI> that knows the merit of Clementina?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, methinks, that this man were proud, vain, arrogant, and a boa&s;ter. How ea&s;ily then might one throw off one's &s;hackles!</P>
<P>Lord G. is very diligent in his court to Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on. His father and aunt are to vi&s;it her this after|noon. She behaves whim&s;ically to my Lord: Yet I cannot think that &s;he <HI>greatly</HI> di&s;likes him.</P>
<P>The Earl of D. and the Counte&s;s Dowager are both in town. The Counte&s;s made a vi&s;it to my cou&s;in Reeves la&s;t Tue&s;day: She &s;poke of me very kindly: She &s;ays that my Lord has heard &s;o much of me, that he is very de&s;irous of &s;eeing me: But &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that &s;ince my heart was not di&s;engaged, &s;he &s;hould be afraid of the con&s;equences of his vi&s;it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My grandmamma, tho' &s;he was &s;o kindly fond of me, would not &s;uffer me to live with her; becau&s;e &s;he thought, that her contemplative temper might in|fluence mine, and make me grave, at a time of life, when &s;he is always &s;aying, that chearfulne&s;s is mo&s;t becoming: She would therefore turn over her girl to the be&s;t of aunts. But now I fancy, &s;he will allow
<PB N="3" REF="4">
me to be more than two days in a week her attendant. My uncle Selby will be glad to &s;pare me. I &s;hall not be able to bear a je&s;t: And then, what &s;hall I be good for?</P>
<P>I have made a fine hand of coming to town, he &s;ays: And &s;o I have: But if my heart is not quite &s;o ea&s;y as it was, it is I hope a better, at lea&s;t, not a <HI>wor&s;e</HI> heart than I brought up with me. Could I only have admired this man, my excur&s;ion would not have been unhappy. But this gratitude, this <HI>entangling,</HI> with all its painful con&s;equences&mdash;But let me &s;ay with my grandmam|ma, the man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! The very man by who&s;e virtues a Clementina was attracted. Upon my word, my dear, unhappy as &s;he is, I rank her with the fir&s;t of women.</P>
<P>I have not had a great deal of Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on's company; but yet more, I am afraid, than I &s;hall ever have again. Very true&mdash;O heart! the mo&s;t way ward of hearts, &s;igh if thou wilt!</P>
<P>You have &s;een how little he was with us, when we were ab&s;olutely in his reach, and when he, as we thought, was in ours. But &s;uch a man cannot, ought not to be engro&s;&s;ed by one family. Ble&s;s me, Lucy, when he comes into public life (for has not his Country a &s;uperior claim to him beyond every private one?) what moment can he have at liberty? Let me enume|rate &s;ome of his pre&s;ent engagements that we know of.</P>
<P>The Danby family mu&s;t have &s;ome farther portion of his time.</P>
<P>The executor&s;hip in the di&s;po&s;al of the 3000<HI>l.</HI> in charity in France as well as in England, will take up a good deal more.</P>
<P>My Lord W. may be &s;aid to be under his tutelage, as to the future happine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois's affairs, and the care he has for her per|&s;on, engage much of his attention.</P>
<P>He is his own &s;teward.</P>
<P>He is making alterations at Grandi&s;on-hall; and has a large genteel neighbourhood there, who long to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
have him re&s;ide among them; and he him&s;elf is fond of that &s;eat.</P>
<P>His e&s;tate in Ireland is in a pro&s;perous way, from the works he &s;et on foot there, when he was on the &s;pot; and he talks, as Dr. Bartlett has hinted to us, of making another vi&s;it to it.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter's match with Lord G. is one of his cares.</P>
<P>He has &s;ervices to perform for his friend Beauchamp, with his father and mother-in-law, for the facilitating his coming over.</P>
<P>The apprehended vi&s;it of Olivia gives him di&s;turb|ance:</P>
<P>And the Bologna family in its various branches, and more e&s;pecially Signor Jeronymo's dangerous &s;tate of health, and Signora Clementina's di&s;order'd mind&mdash;O Lucy!&mdash;What lei&s;ure has this man to be in love?&mdash;Yet how can I &s;ay &s;o, when he is in love already? And with Clementina&mdash;And don't you think, that when he goes to France on the executor&s;hip account, he will make a vi&s;it to Bologna?&mdash;Ah, my dear, to be &s;ure he will!</P>
<P>After he has left England therefore, which I &s;up|po&s;e he will quickly do, and when I am in Northamp|ton&s;hire, what opportunities will your Harriet have to &s;ee him, except &s;he can obtain, as a favour, the power of obliging his Emily, in her reque&s;t to be with her? Then, Lucy, he may, on his return to England, once a year or &s;o, on his vi&s;iting his ward, &s;ee, and thank for her care and love of his Emily, his half-e&s;tranged Harriet!&mdash;Perhaps Lady <HI>Clementina Grandi&s;on</HI> will be with him! God re&s;tore her! Surely I &s;hall be ca|pable, if &s;he be Lady Grandi&s;on, of rejoicing in her recovery!&mdash;</P>
<P>Fie upon it&mdash;Why this involuntary tear? You will &s;ee it by the large blot it has made, if I did not men|tion it.</P>
<P>Excellent man! Dr. Bartlett has ju&s;t been telling
<PB N="5" REF="6">
me of a morning vi&s;it he received, before he went out of town, from the two &s;ons of Mrs. Oldham.</P>
<P>One of them is about &s;even years old; the other a|bout five; very fine children. He embraced them, the doctor &s;ays, with as much tenderne&s;s as if they were children of his own mother. He enquired into their inclinations, behaviour, diver&s;ions; and engaged equal|ly their love and reverence.</P>
<P>He told them, that, if they were good, he would love them; and &s;aid, he had a dear friend, whom he reverenced as his father, a man with white curling locks, he told the children, that they might know him at fir&s;t &s;ight, who would now-and-then, as he happened to be in town, make enquiries after their good behaviour, and reward them, as they gave him cau&s;e. Accord|ingly he had de&s;ired Dr. Bartlett to give them occa&s;i|onally his countenance; as al&s;o to let their mother know, that &s;he &s;hould be glad of a vi&s;it from her, and her three children, on his return to town.</P>
<P>The doctor had been to &s;ee her when he came to me. He found all three with her. The two younger, im|pre&s;&s;ed by the venerable de&s;cription Sir Charles had gi|ven of him, voluntarily, the younger by the elder's example, fell down on their knees before him, and beg|ged his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Mr. Oldham is about eighteen years of age; a well|inclined, well educated youth. He was full of ac|knowlegements of the favour done him in his invita|tation.</P>
<P>The grateful mother could not contain her&s;elf. Ble&s;&s;ings without number, &s;he invoked on her bene|factor for his goodne&s;s in taking &s;uch kind notice of her two &s;ons, as he had done; and &s;aid, he had been, ever &s;ince his gracious behaviour to her in E&s;&s;ex, the fir&s;t and la&s;t in her prayers to heaven. But the invitation to her&s;elf, &s;he declared, was too great an honour for her to accept of: She &s;hould not be able to &s;tand in his
<PB N="6" REF="7">
pre&s;ence. Alas! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, can the &s;evere&s;t, true&s;t penitence recall the guilty pa&s;t?</P>
<P>The doctor &s;aid, That Sir Charles Grandi&s;on ever made it a rule with him, to rai&s;e the dejected and hum|bled &s;pirit. Your birth and education, madam, intitle you to a place in the fir&s;t company: And where there are two lights in which the behaviour of any per&s;on may be &s;et, tho' there has been unhappine&s;s, he always remembers the mo&s;t favourable, and forgets the other. I would advi&s;e you, madam (as he has invited you) by all means to come. He &s;peaks with plea&s;ure of your humility and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The doctor told me, that Sir Charles had made en|quiries after the marriage of Major O-Hara with Mrs. Jervois, and had &s;atisfied him&s;elf that they were actu|ally man and wife. Methinks I am glad for Mi&s;s Jer|vois's &s;ake, that her mother has changed her name. They lived not happily together &s;ince their la&s;t enter|prize: For the man, who had long been a &s;ufferer from poverty, was in fear of lo&s;ing one half at lea&s;t of his wife's annuity, by what pa&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion; and accu&s;ed her of putting them upon the mi&s;behaviour he was guilty of; which had brought upon him, he &s;aid, the re&s;entments of a man admired by all the world.</P>
<P>The attorney, who vi&s;ited Sir Charles from the&s;e people, at their reque&s;t, waited on him again, in their names, with hopes that they &s;hould not &s;uffer in their annuity, and expre&s;&s;ing their concern for having of|fended him.</P>
<P>Mrs. O-Hara al&s;o reque&s;ted it as a favour to &s;ee her daughter.</P>
<P>Sir Charles commi&s;&s;ioned the attorney, who is a man of repute, to tell them, that if Mrs. O-Hara would come to St. James's Square next Wedne&s;day about five o'clock, Mi&s;s Jervois &s;hould be introduced to her; and &s;he &s;hould be welcome to bring with her her hu&s;|band, and Captain Salmonet, that they might be con|vinced he bore no ill-will to either of them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Adieu, till by-and-by. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on is come, in one of her u&s;ual hurries, to oblige me to be pre&s;ent at the vi&s;it to be made her this afternoon, by the Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude, his &s;i&s;ter, a maiden lady ad|vanced in years, who is exceedingly fond of her ne|phew, and intends to make him heir of her large for|tune.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Earl is an agreeable man: Lady Gertrude is a <HI>very</HI> agreeable woman. They &s;aw Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on with the young Lord's eyes; and were better plea&s;ed with her, as I told her afterwards, than <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have been, or then <HI>they</HI> would, had they known her as well as I do. She doubted not, &s;he an&s;wered me, but I &s;hould find fault with her; and yet &s;he was as good as for her life &s;he could be.</P>
<P>Such an archne&s;s in every motion! Such a turn of the eye to me on my Lord G's a&s;&s;iduities! Such a fear in him of her correcting glance! Such an half-timid, half-free parade when he had done any-thing that he intended to be obliging, and now-and-then an aiming at raillery, as if he was not <HI>very</HI> much afraid of her, and dared to &s;peak his mind even to <HI>her!</HI> On her part, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;uch an air, as if &s;he had a learner before her; and was ready to rap his knuckles, had no|body been pre&s;ent to mediate for him; that tho' I could not but love her for her very archne&s;s, yet in my mind, I could, for their &s;akes, but more for her own, have &s;everely chidden her.</P>
<P>She is a charming woman; and every-thing &s;he &s;ays and does becomes her. But I am &s;o much afraid of what may be the ca&s;e, when the lover is changed into the hu&s;band, that I wi&s;h to my&s;elf now-and-then, when I &s;ee her &s;o lively, that &s;he would remember that there was once &s;uch a man as Captain Ander&s;on. But &s;he makes it a rule, &s;he &s;ays, to remember no|thing that will vex her.</P>
<P>Is not my memory (&s;aid &s;he once) given me for my
<PB N="8" REF="9">
benefit, and &s;hall I make it my torment? No, Har|riet, I will leave that to be done by you wi&s;e ones, and &s;ee what you will get by it.</P>
<P>Why this, Charlotte, replied I, the wife ones may have a <HI>chance</HI> to get by it&mdash;They will very probably, by remembring pa&s;t mi&s;takes, avoid many inconveniencies into which forgetfulne&s;s will run you lively ones.</P>
<P>Well, well, returned &s;he, we are not all of us born to equal honour. Some of us are to be &s;et up for warn|ings, &s;ome for examples: And the fir&s;t are generally of greater u&s;e to the world than the other.</P>
<P>Now, Charlotte, &s;aid I, do you de&s;troy the force of your own argument. Can the per&s;on who is &s;ingled out for the warning, be near &s;o happy, as &s;he that is &s;et up for the example?</P>
<P>You are right as far as I know, Harriet: But I obey the pre&s;ent impul&s;e, and try to find an excu&s;e after|wards for what that puts me upon: And all the differ|ence in this, as to the reward, I have a <HI>joy:</HI> You a <HI>comfort:</HI> But comfort is a poor word; and I can't bear it.</P>
<P>So Biddy in the Tender Hu&s;band would have &s;aid, Charlotte. But poor as the word is with you and her, give me <HI>comfort</HI> rather than <HI>joy,</HI> if they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;epa|rated. But I &s;ee not but that a woman of my Char|lotte's happy turn may have <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>She tapped my cheek&mdash;Take that, Harriet, for making a Biddy of me. I believe, if you have not <HI>joy,</HI> you have <HI>comfort,</HI> in your &s;everity.</P>
<P>My heart as well as my cheek glowed at the prai&s;es the Earl and the Lady both joined in (with a fervor that was creditable to their own hearts) of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, while they told us what this man, and hat woman of quality or con&s;ideration &s;aid of him. Who would not be good? What is life without re|putation? Do we not wi&s;h to be remembered with honour after death? And what a &s;hare of it has this excellent man in his life!&mdash;May nothing for the ho|nour-&s;ake
<PB N="9" REF="10">
of human nature, to which he is &s;o great an ornament, ever happen to tarni&s;h it!</P>
<P>They made <HI>me</HI> an hundred fine compliments. I could not but be plea&s;ed at &s;tanding well in their opi|nion: But, believe me, my dear, I did not enjoy their prai&s;es of me, as I did tho&s;e they gave him. Indeed I had the pre&s;umption, from the approbation given to what they &s;aid of him by my own heart, to imagine my&s;elf a &s;harer in them, tho' not in his merits. Oh, Lucy! <HI>ought</HI> there not to have been a relation between us, &s;ince what I have &s;aid, from what I found in my|&s;elf on hearing him prai&s;ed, is a demon&s;tration of a regard for him &s;uperior to the love of &s;elf?</P>
<P>Adieu, my Lucy. I know I have all your prayers.</P>

<P>DR. Bartlett is one of the kinde&s;t as well as be&s;t of men. I believe he loves me as if I were his own child: But good men mu&s;t be affectionate men. He received but this morning a letter from Sir Charles, and ha&s;tened to communicate &s;ome of its contents to me, tho' I could pretend to no other motive but cu|rio&s;ity for wi&s;hing to be acquainted with the proceed|ings of his patron.</P>
<P>Sir Charles dined, as he had intended, with Sir Hargrave and his friends. He complains in his letter of a riotous day: <Q REND="inline">"Yet I think, adds he, it has led me into &s;ome u&s;eful reflexions. It is not indeed agreeable to be the &s;pectator of riot; but how ea&s;y to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">un being a partaker in it! How ea&s;y to avoid the too freely circling gla&s;s, if a man is known to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule to him&s;elf, from which he will not depart; and if it be not refu&s;ed &s;ullenly; but mirth and good humour
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the more &s;tudiou&s;ly kept up, by the per&s;on; who would el&s;e indeed be looked upon as a &s;py on unguarded folly! I heartily pitied a young man, who, I dare &s;ay, has a good heart, but from fal&s;e &s;hame dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ert the freedom that every Engli&s;hman would claim a right to, in almo&s;t every other in&s;tance! He had once put by the gla&s;s, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf on account of his health; but on being laughed at for a <HI>&s;ober dog,</HI> as they phra&s;ed it, and a&s;ked, if his <HI>&s;pou&s;e</HI> had not lectured him be|fore he came out, he gave way to the wretched rail|lery: Nor could I interfere at &s;uch a noi&s;y moment with effect: They had laughed him out of his cauti|on before I could be heard; and I left him there at nine o'clock trying with Bagenhall which &s;hould drink the deepe&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I wi&s;h, my good Dr. Bartlett, you would throw together &s;ome &s;erious con&s;iderations on this &s;ubject. You could touch it delicately, and &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e would not be unu&s;eful to &s;ome few of our neighbours even at Grandi&s;on-hall. What is it, that, in this &s;ingle article, men &s;acrifice to fal&s;e &s;hame and fal&s;e glory! Rea&s;on, health, fortune, per&s;onal elegance, the peace and order of their families; and all the com|fort and honour of their after-years. How peevi&s;h, how wretched, is the decline of a man worn out with intemperance! In a cool hour, re&s;olutions might be formed, that &s;hould &s;tand the attack of a boi&s;terous je&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I obtained leave from Dr. Bartlett, to tran&s;cribe this part of the letter. I thought my uncle would be plea|&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>It was near ten at night, before Sir Charles got to Lord W's, tho' but three miles from Sir Hargrave's. My Lord rejoiced to &s;ee him; and, after fir&s;t com|pliments, a&s;ked him, if he had thought of what he had undertaken for him. Sir Charles told him, that he was the more de&s;irous of &s;eeing him in his way to
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the Hall, becau&s;e he wanted to know if his Lord&s;hip held his mind as to marriage. He a&s;&s;ured him he did, and would &s;ign and &s;eal to whatever he &s;hould &s;tipulate for him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed for a copy of this part of Sir Charles's let|ter, for the &s;ake of my aunt, who&s;e delicacy would, I thought, be charmed with it. He has been &s;o good as to &s;ay, he would tran&s;cribe it for me. I will inlo&s;e it, Lucy; and you will read it here:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"I cannot, my Lord, &s;aid Sir Charles, engage, that the Lady will comply with the propo&s;al I &s;hall take the liberty to make to her mother and her. She is not more than three or four and thirty: She is hand|&s;ome: She has a fine under&s;tanding: She is brought up an oeconomi&s;t: She is a woman of good family: She has not, however, tho' born to happier pro&s;pects, a fortune worthy of your Lord&s;hip's acceptance. Whatever that is, your Lord&s;hip will perhaps choo&s;e to give it to her family.</P>
<P>With all my heart and &s;oul, nephew: But do you &s;ay, &s;he is hand&s;ome? Do you &s;ay, &s;he is of family? And has &s;he &s;o many good qualities?&mdash;Ah, nephew? She won't have me, I doubt.&mdash;And is &s;he not too young, Sir Charles, to think of &s;uch a poor decrepit &s;oul as I am?</P>
<P>All I can &s;ay to this, my Lord, is, that the propo|&s;als on your part mu&s;t be the more generous&mdash;</P>
<P>I will leave all tho&s;e matters to you, kin&s;man&mdash;</P>
<P>This, my Lord, I will take upon me to an&s;wer for, That &s;he is a woman of principle: She will not give your Lord&s;hip her hand, if &s;he thinks &s;he cannot make you a wife worthy of your utmo&s;t kindne&s;s: And now, my Lord, I will tell you who &s;he is, that you may make what other enquiries you think pro|per.</P>
<P>And then I named her to him, and gave him pretty near the account of the family, and the circum&s;tances
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and affairs of it, that I &s;hall by-and-by give you; tho' you are not quite a &s;tranger to the unhappy ca&s;e.</P>
<P>My Lord was in raptures: He knew &s;omething, be &s;aid, of the Lady's father, and enough of the family, by hear&s;ay, to confirm all I had &s;aid of them; and be|&s;ought me to do my utmo&s;t to bring the affair to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Mansfield was a very good man; and much re&s;pected in his neighbourhood. He was once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large e&s;tate; but his father left him in|volved in a law-&s;uit to &s;upport his title to more than one half of it.</P>
<P>After it had been depending &s;everal years, it was at la&s;t, to the deep regret of all who knew him, by the ehicanery of the lawyers of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of his own, carried again&s;t him; and his expences having been very great in &s;upporting for years his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he found him&s;elf reduced from an e&s;tate of near three thou&s;and pounds a year, to little more than five hundred. He had &s;ix children: Four &s;ons, and two daughters. His elde&s;t &s;on died of grief in two months after the lo&s;s of the cau&s;e. The &s;econd, now the elde&s;t, is a melancholy man. The third is a cor|net of hor&s;e. The fourth is unprovided for; but all three are men of worthy minds, and de&s;erve better fortune.</P>
<P>The daughters are remarkable for their piety, pa|tience, good oeconomy, and prudence. They are the mo&s;t dutiful of children, and mo&s;t affectionate of &s;i&s;ters. They were for three years the &s;upport of their father's &s;pirits, and have always been the con&s;olation of their mother. They lo&s;t their father about four years ago: And it is even edifying to ob&s;erve&punc; how elegantly they &s;upport the family reputation in their fine old man&s;ion hou&s;e by the prudent management of their little income; for the matter leaves every hou&s;hold care to them; and they make it a rule to conclude the year with di&s;charging every demand that

can be made upon them, and to commence the new year ab&s;olutely clear of the world, and with &s;ome ca&s;h in hand; yet were brought up in affluence, and to the expectation of hand&s;ome fortunes; for, be&s;ides that they could have no thought of lo&s;ing their cau&s;e, they had very great and rea&s;onable pro&s;pects from Mr Cal|vert, an uncle by their mother's &s;ide; who was rich in money, and had be&s;ides an e&s;tate in land of 1500 <HI>l.</HI> a year. He always declared, that for the &s;ake of his &s;i&s;ter's children he would continue a &s;ingle man; and kept his word till he was upwards of &s;eventy; when, being very infirm in health, and defective even to do|tage in his under&s;tanding, Bolton his &s;teward, who had always &s;tood in the way of his inclination to have his elde&s;t niece for his companion and manager, at le&s;t contrived to get him married to a young creature un|der twenty, one of the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e; who brought him a child in &s;even months; and was with child again at the old man's death, which happened in eighteen months after his marriage: And then a will was provided, in which he gave all he had to his wife and her children born, and to be born, within a year after his demi&s;e. This &s;teward and woman now live together as man and wife</P>
<P>A worthy clergyman, who hoped it might be in my power to procure them redre&s;s, either in the one ca&s;e or in the other, gave me the above particulars; and upon enquiry, finding every-thing to be as repre&s;ent|ed, I made my&s;elf acquainted with the widow Lady and her &s;ons: And it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them at their own hou&s;e, and not re&s;pect the daughters for their amiable qualities.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired them, when I was la&s;t down, to put into my hands their titles, deeds, and papers; which they have done; and they have been laid before coun&s;el, who gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e a very hopeful account of them.</P>
<P>Being fully authoriz'd by my Lord, I took leave of him over-night, and &s;et out early in the morning, directly
<PB N="14" REF="15">
for Mansfield-hou&s;e. I arrived there &s;oon after their breakfa&s;t was over, and was received by Lady Man&s;|field, her &s;ons (who happened to be all at home) and her two daughters, with politene&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general conver&s;ation, I took Lady Man&s;|field a&s;ide; and, making an apology for my freedom, a&s;ked her, If Mi&s;s Mansfield were, to her knowlege, engaged in her affections?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, &s;he was <HI>&s;ure</HI> &s;he was not: Ah, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, a man of your ob&s;ervation mu&s;t know, that the daughters of a decayed family of &s;ome note in the world, do not ea&s;ily get hu&s;bands. Men of great for|tunes look higher: Men of &s;mall mu&s;t look out for wives to enlarge them; and men of genteel bu&s;ine&s;&s;es are afraid of young women better born than portioned. Every-body knows not that my girls can bend to their condition; and they mu&s;t be contented to live &s;ingle all their lives; and &s;o they will choo&s;e to do, rather than not marry creditably, and with &s;ome pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>I then opened my mind fully to her. She was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed: But who, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, would expect &s;uch a propo&s;al from the next heir to Lord W.?</P>
<P>I made known to her how much in earne&s;t I was in this propo&s;al, as well for my Lord's &s;ake, as for the young Lady's. I will take care, madam, &s;aid I, that Mi&s;s Mansfield, if &s;he will con&s;ent to make Lord W. happy, &s;hall have very hand&s;ome &s;ettlements, and &s;uch an allowance for pin-money, as &s;hall enable her to gratify every moderate, every rea&s;onable, wi&s;h of her heart.</P>
<P>Was it po&s;&s;ible, &s;he a&s;ked, for &s;uch an affair to be brought about? Would my Lord&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I would be an&s;werable for him: And de&s;ired her to break the matter to her daughter directly.</P>
<P>I left Lady Mansfield, and joined the brothers, who were with their two &s;i&s;ters; and &s;oon after Mi&s;s Man&s;|field was &s;ent for by her mother.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
After they had been a little while together, my Lady Mansfield &s;ent to &s;peak with me. They were both &s;ilent when I came in. The mother was at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay: The daughter was in &s;till greater confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the mother. You have, I perceive, madam, acquainted Mi&s;s Mansfield with the propo&s;al I made to you. I am fully authorized to make it. Propitious be your &s;ilence! There never was, proceeded I, a treaty of marriage &s;et on foot, that had not its conveniencies and inconveniencies. My Lord is greatly afflicted with the gout: There is too great a di&s;parity in years The&s;e are the inconve|niencies which are to be con&s;idered of for the lady.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if Mi&s;s Mansfield can give into the propo&s;al, &s;he will be received by my Lord as a ble&s;&s;ing; as one who&s;e acceptance of him will lay him under an obligation to her. If this propo&s;al could not have been made with dignity and honour to the lady, it had not come from me.</P>
<P>The conveniencies to your&s;elves will more properly fall under the con&s;ideration of your&s;elves and family. One thing only I will &s;ugge&s;t, that an alliance with &s;o rich a man as Lord W. will make perhaps &s;ome people tremble, who now think them&s;elves &s;ecure.</P>
<P>But, madam, to the &s;till &s;ilent daughter, let not a regard for me bya&s;s you: Your family may be &s;ure of my be&s;t &s;ervices, whether my propo&s;al be received or rejected.</P>
<P>My Lord (I mu&s;t deal &s;incerely with you) has lived a life of error. He thinks &s;o him&s;elf. I am earne&s;t to have him &s;ee the difference, and to have an oppor|tunity to rejoice with him upon it.</P>
<P>I &s;topt: But both being &s;till &s;ilent, the mother look|ing on the daughter, the dau hter glancing now-and-then her con&s;cious eye on the mother, If, madam, &s;aid I, you <HI>can</HI> give your hand to Lord W. I will take care, that &s;ettlements &s;hall exceed your expectation.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
What I have ob&s;erved as well as heard of Mi&s;s Man&s;|field's temper and goodne&s;s, is the principal motive of my application to her, in preference to all the wo|men I know.</P>
<P>But permit me to &s;ay, that were your affections engaged to the lowe&s;t hone&s;t man on earth, I would not wi&s;h for your favour to my Lord W. And farther, if, madam, you think you &s;hould have but the &s;hadow of a hope, to induce your compliance, that my Lord's death would be more agreeable to you than his life, then would I not, for your morality's &s;ake, wi&s;h you to engage. In a word, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, Mi&s;s Mansfield, as to a woman of honour and con&s;cience: If your con&s;cience bids you <HI>doubt,</HI> reject the propo&s;al; and this not only for my Lord's &s;ake, but for your own.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, if, without too great a force upon your inclinations, you can behave with that conde&s;cen&s;ion and indulgence to a man who has ha&s;tened advanc'd age upon him&s;elf, which I have thought from your temper I might hope.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid a great deal, becau&s;e you, ladies, were &s;ilent; and becau&s;e explicitne&s;s in every ca&s;e becomes the propo&s;er. Give me leave to withdraw for a few moments.</P>
<P>I withdrew, accordingly, to the brothers and &s;i&s;ter. I did not think I ought to mention to them the pro|po&s;al I had made: It might perhaps have engaged them all in its favour, as it was of &s;uch evident advantage to the whole family; and that might have impo&s;ed a difficulty on the Lady, that neither for her own &s;ake, nor my Lord's, it would have been ju&s;t to lay upon her.</P>
<P>Lady Mansfield came out to me, and &s;aid, I pre|&s;ume, Sir, as we are a family which misfortune, as well as love, has clo&s;ely bound together, you will allow it to be mentioned&mdash;</P>
<P>To the whole family, madam?&mdash;By all means.
<PB N="17" REF="18">
I wanted only fir&s;t to know, whether Mi&s;s Mansfield's affections were di&s;engaged: And now you &s;hall give me leave to attend Mi&s;s Mansfield. I am a party for my Lord W.: Mi&s;s Mansfield is a party: Your de|bates will be the more free in our ab&s;ence. If I find her aver&s;e, believe me, madam, I will not endeavour to per&s;uade her. On the contrary, if &s;he declare again&s;t accepting the propo&s;al, I will be her advocate, tho' every one el&s;e would vote in its favour.</P>
<P>The brothers and &s;i&s;ter looked upon one another: I left the mother to propo&s;e it to them; and &s;tept into the inner parlour to Mi&s;s Mansfield.</P>
<P>She was &s;itting with her back to the door, in a me|ditating po&s;ture. She &s;tarted at my entrance.</P>
<P>I talked of indifferent &s;ubjects, in order to divert her from the important one, that had taken up her whole attention.</P>
<P>It would have been a degree of oppre&s;&s;ion to her to have entered with her upon a &s;ubject of &s;o much con|&s;equence to her while we were alone; and when her not having given a negative, was to be taken as a mo|de&s;t affirmative.</P>
<P>Lady Mansfield &s;oon joined us&mdash;My dear daughter, &s;aid &s;he, we are all unanimous. We have agreed to leave every thing to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: And we hope you will.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent. I will only a&s;k you, madam, &s;aid I, to her, If you have any wi&s;h to take time to con&s;i|der of the matter? Do you think you &s;h ll be ea&s;ier in your mind, if you take time?&mdash;She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I will not at this time, my good Mi&s;s Mansfield, urge you farther. I will make my report to Lord W. and you &s;hall be &s;ure of his joyful approbation of the &s;teps I have taken, before your final con&s;ent &s;hall be a&s;ked for. But that I may not be employed in a doubt|ful cau&s;e, let me be commi&s;&s;ioned to tell my Lord, that you are di&s;engaged; and that you wholly re&s;ign your&s;elf to your mother's advice.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
She bowed her head.</P>
<P>And that <HI>you,</HI> madam, to Lady Mansfield, are not aver&s;e to enter into treaty upon this important &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P><HI>Aver&s;e,</HI> Sir! &s;aid the mother, bowing, and grate|fully &s;miling.</P>
<P>I will write the particulars of our conver&s;ation to Lord W. and my opinion of &s;ettlements, and advi&s;e him (if I am not forbid) to make a vi&s;it at Mansfield|hou&s;e [I &s;topt: they were both &s;ilent]. If po&s;&s;ible, I will attend my Lord in his fir&s;t vi&s;it. I hope, madam, to Mi&s;s Mansfield, you will not di&s;like him: I am &s;ure he will be charmed with you: He is far from being di&s;agreeable in his per&s;on: His temper is not bad. <HI>Your</HI> goodne&s;s will make <HI>him</HI> good. I dare &s;ay that he will engage your gratitude; and I defy a good mind to &s;eparate love from gratitude.</P>
<P>We returned to company. I had all their ble&s;&s;ings pronounced at once, as from one mouth. The me|lancholy brother was enlivened: Who knows but the con&s;equence of this alliance may illuminate his mind? I could &s;ee by the plea&s;ure they all had, in beholding him capable of joy on the occa&s;ion, that they hoped it would. The unhappy &s;ituation of the family affairs, as it broke the heart of the elde&s;t brother, fixed a gloom on the temper of this gentleman.</P>
<P>I was prevailed upon to dine with them. In the conver&s;ation we had at and after dinner, their minds opened, and their characters ro&s;e upon me. Lord W. will be charmed with Mi&s;s Mansfield. I am delighted to think, that my mother's brother will be happy, in the latter part of his life, with a wife of &s;o much pru|dence and goodne&s;s, as I am &s;ure this Lady will make him. On one in&s;tance of her very obliging behaviour to me, I whi&s;pered her &s;i&s;ter, Pray, Mi&s;s Fanny, tell Mi&s;s Mansfield, but not till I am gone, that &s;he knows not the inconveniencies &s;he is bringing upon her&s;elf: I may, perhaps, hereafter, have the boldne&s;s, to look for
<PB N="19" REF="20">
the &s;ame favour from my aunt, that I meet with from Mi&s;s Mansfield.</P>
<P>If my &s;i&s;ter, returned &s;he, &s;hould ever mi&s;behave to her benefactor, I will deny my relation to her.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to write to Lady Mansfield as &s;oon as I heard from my Lord; and parted with them, followed by the ble&s;&s;ings of them all.</P>
<P>You will &s;oon have another letter from me, with an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of my vi&s;it to Sir Harry Beauchamp and his Lady. <HI>We</HI> mu&s;t have our Beau|champ among us, my dear friend; I &s;hould rather &s;ay, <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t among <HI>you;</HI> for I &s;hall not be long in Eng|land.

<P>I Arrived at Sir Harry Beauchamp's about twelve this day. He and his Lady expected me, from the letter which I wrote and &s;hewed you before I left the town; in which, you know, I acquainted Sir Harry with his &s;on's earne&s;t de&s;ire to throw him&s;elf at his feet, and to pay his duty to his mother, in England; and engaged to call my&s;elf, either this day or to-mor|row, for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Sir Harry received me with great civility, and even affection. Lady Beauchamp, &s;aid he, will be with us in a moment. I am afraid you will not meet with all the civility from her on the errand you are come upon, that a man of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's character de&s;erves to meet with from all the world. We have been unhappy together, ever &s;ince we had your Letter. I long to &s;ee my &s;on: Your friend&s;hip for him e&s;ta|bli&s;hes him in my heart. But&mdash;And then he cur&s;ed the apron-&s;tring tenure, by which, he &s;aid, he held his peace.</P>
<P>You will allow me, Sir Harry, &s;aid I, to addre&s;s my&s;elf in my own way to my lady. You give me plea&s;ure, in letting me know, that the difficulty is not with you. You have indeed, Sir, one of the mo&s;t prudent young men in the world for your &s;on. His heart is in your hand: you may form it as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>She is coming! She is coming! interrupted he. We are all in pieces: We were in the mid&s;t of a feud, when you arrived. If &s;he is not civil to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;</P>

Harry; as if they had not had their contention out, and &s;he was ready to renew it.</P>
<P>With as obliging an air as I could a&s;&s;ume, I paid my compliments to her. She received them with great &s;tiffne&s;s: &s;welling at Sir Harry: Who &s;idled to the door, in a moody and &s;ullen manner, and then &s;lipt out.</P>
<P>You are Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, &s;aid &s;he: I never &s;aw you before: I have heard much talk of you&mdash;But, pray, Sir, are good men <HI>always</HI> offi|cious men? Cannot they perform the obligations of friend&s;hip, without di&s;compo&s;ing families?</P>
<P>You &s;ee me <HI>now,</HI> madam, in an evil moment, if you are di&s;plea&s;ed with me: But I am not u&s;ed to the di&s;plea&s;ure of ladies: I do my utmo&s;t not to de&s;erve it; and, let me tell you, madam, that I will not &s;uf|fer <HI>you</HI> to be di&s;plea&s;ed with me.</P>
<P>I took her half-reluctant hand, and led her to a chair, and &s;eated my&s;elf in another near her.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, Sir, you have your arts.</P>
<P>She took the fire-&s;creen, that hung by the &s;ide of the chimney, and held it before her face, now glanc|ing at me, now turning away her eye, as re&s;olved to be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>You come upon a hateful errand, Sir: I have been unhappy ever &s;ince your officious Letter came.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it, madam. While you are warm with the remembrance of a pa&s;t mi&s;under&s;tanding, I will not offer to rea&s;on with you: But let me, ma|dam, &s;ee le&s;s di&s;compo&s;ure in your looks. I want to take my impre&s;&s;ions of you from more placid features: I am a painter, madam; I love to draw lady's pictures. Will you have this pa&s;s for a fir&s;t &s;itting?</P>
<P>She knew not what to do with her anger; She was loth to part with it.</P>
<P>You are impertinent, Sir Charles&mdash;Excu&s;e me&mdash;You are impertinent&mdash;</P>
<P>I do excu&s;e you, Lady Beauchamp: And the rather,

as I am &s;ure you do not think me &s;o. Your freedom is a mark of your favour; and I thank you for it.</P>
<P>You treat me as a child, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>I treat all angry people as children: I love to hu|mour them. Indeed, Lady Beauchamp, you mu&s;t not be angry with me. <HI>Can</HI> I be mi&s;taken? Don't I &s;ee in your a&s;pect the woman of &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on?&mdash;I never blame a lady for her humour&s;omene&s;s &s;o much, as in my mind, I blame her mother.</P>
<P>Sir! &s;aid &s;he. I &s;miled. She bit her lip, to avoid returning a &s;mile.</P>
<P>Her character, my dear friend, is not, you know, that of an ill-temper'd woman, tho' haughty, and a lover of power.</P>
<P>I have heard much of you, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: But I am quite mi&s;taken in you: I expected to &s;ee a grave formal young man, his prim mouth &s;et in plaits: But you are a joker; and a free man; a <HI>very</HI> free man, I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I would be <HI>thought</HI> decently free, madam; but not <HI>impertinent.</HI> I &s;ee with plea&s;ure a returning &s;mile. O that ladies knew how much &s;miles become their features!&mdash;Very few cau&s;es can ju&s;tify a woman's an|ger&mdash;Your &s;ex, madam, was given to delight, not to torment us.</P>
<P><HI>Torment</HI> you, Sir! Pray, has Sir Harry&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Harry cannot look plea&s;ed, when his Lady is <HI>di&s;</HI>-plea&s;ed: I &s;aw that you were, madam, the mo|ment I beheld you. I hope I am not an un welcome vi&s;itor to Sir Harry for one hour (I intend to &s;tay no longer) that he received me with &s;o di&s;turbed a coun|tenance, and has now withdrawn him&s;elf, as if to avoid me.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth, Sir Harry and I have had a di&s;pute: But he always &s;peaks of Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Is he not offended with me, madam, for the con|tents of the Letter&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
No, Sir, and I &s;uppo&s;e you hardly think he is&mdash;But <HI>I</HI> am&mdash;</P>

<P>I <HI>am</HI> the Grandi&s;on you call me; and I honour the maternal character. You mu&s;t permit me to honour <HI>you,</HI> madam.</P>
<P>I <HI>wonder,</HI> Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not be denied. The world reports mi&s;under|&s;tandings between you and Mr. Beauchamp. That bu&s;y world that will be meddling, knows your power, and his dependence. You mu&s;t not let it charge you with an ill u&s;e of that power: If you do, <HI>you</HI> will have its blame, when you might have its prai&s;e: <HI>He</HI> will have its pity.</P>
<P>What, Sir, do you think your fine Letters, and &s;mooth words, will avail in favour of a young fellow who has treated me with di&s;re&s;pect?</P>
<P>You are mi&s;informed, madam&mdash;I am willing to have a greater dependence upon your Ju&s;tice, upon your good nature, than upon any-thing I can urge ei|ther by letter or &s;peech. Don't let it be &s;aid, that you are not to be prevailed on&mdash;A woman not to be
<PB N="25" REF="26">
prevailed on to join in an act of ju&s;tice, of kindne&s;s; for the honour of the &s;ex, let it not be &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Honour of the &s;ex,</HI> Sir!&mdash;Fine talking!&mdash;Don't I know, that were I to con&s;ent to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s comi g over, the fir&s;t thing would be to have his annuity augmented out of my fortune? He and his father would be in a party again&s;t me. Am I not already a &s;ufferer thro' him in his father's love?&mdash;You don't know, Sir, what has pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Harry and me within this half|hour&mdash;But don't talk to me: I won't hear of it: The young man hates me: I hate him: And ever will.</P>
<P>She made a motion to go.</P>
<P>With a re&s;pectful air, I told her, &s;he mu&s;t not leave me. My motive de&s;erv'd not, I &s;aid, that both &s;he and Sir Harry &s;hould leave me in di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>You know but too well, re&s;umed &s;he, how accept|able your officiou&s;ne&s;s (I mu&s;t call it &s;o) is to Sir Harry.</P>
<P>And <HI>does</HI> Sir Harry, madam, favour his &s;on's &s;uit? You rejoice me: Let not Mr. Beauchamp know that he does: And do <HI>you,</HI> my dear Lady Beauchamp, take the whole merit of it to your&s;elf. How will he revere you for your Goodne&s;s to him! And what an obligation, if, as you &s;ay, Sir Harry is inclined to fa|vour him, will you, by your generous fir&s;t motion, lay upon Sir Harry?</P>
<P>Obligation upon Sir Harry! Yes, Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on, I have laid too many obligations already upon him, for his gratitude.</P>
<P>Lay this one more. You own you have had a mi&s;|under&s;tanding this morning: Sir Harry is withdrawn, I &s;uppo&s;e, with his heart full: Let me, I be&s;eech you, make up the mi&s;under&s;tanding. I have been happy in this way&mdash;Thus we will order it&mdash;We will de&s;ire him to walk in. I will beg <HI>your</HI> intere&s;t with him in favour of the contents of the letter I &s;ent. His compliance will follow as an act of obligingne&s;s to you. The grace of the action will be yours. I will
<PB N="26" REF="27">
be an&s;werable for Mr. Beauchamp's gratitude.&mdash;Dear madam, he&s;itate not. The young gentleman mu&s;t come over one day: Let the favour of its being an early one, be owing entirely to you.</P>
<P>You are a &s;trange man, Sir: I don't like you at all: You would per&s;uade me out of my rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Let us, madam, as Mr. Beauchamp and I are al|ready the deare&s;t of friends, begin a <HI>family</HI> under|&s;tanding. Let St. James's Square, and Berkley Square, when you come to town, be a next-door neighbour|hood. Give me the con&s;ideration of being the bond&s;|man for the duty of Mr. Beauchamp to you, as well as to his father.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent: But looked vexed and irre&s;olute.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ters, madam, are amiable women. You will be plea&s;ed with them. Lord L. is a man worthy of Sir Harry's acquaintance. We &s;hall want nothing, if you would think &s;o, but Mr. Beauchamp's pre&s;ence among us.</P>
<P>What! I &s;uppo&s;e you de&s;ign your maiden &s;i&s;ter for the <HI>young fellow</HI>&mdash;But if you do, Sir, you mu&s;t a&s;k me for&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Indeed I do not. He is not at pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ed to marry. He never will without his father's approba|tion, and let me &s;ay&mdash;<HI>yours.</HI> My &s;i&s;ter is addre&s;&s;ed to by Lord G. and I hope will &s;oon be married to him.</P>
<P>And do you &s;ay &s;o, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?&mdash;Why then you are a more di&s;intere&s;ted man than I thought you in this application to Sir Harry. I had no doubt but the <HI>young fellow</HI> was to be brought over to marry Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on; and that he was to be made worthy of her at my expence.</P>
<P>She enjoyed, as it &s;eemed, by her manner of pro|nouncing the words <HI>young fellow,</HI> that de&s;igned con|tempt, which was a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of the con&s;e|quence he once was of to her.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, madam, that I know not his heart, if he has at pre&s;ent any thoughts of marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
She &s;eemed plea&s;ed at this a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>I repeated my wi&s;hes, that &s;he would take to her|&s;elf the merit of allowing Mr. Beauchamp to return to his native country: And that &s;he would let me &s;ee her hand in Sir Harry's, before I left them.</P>
<P>And pray Sir, as to his place of re&s;idence, <HI>were</HI> he to come: Do you think he &s;hould live under the &s;ame roof with me?</P>
<P>You &s;hall govern that point, madam, as you ap|prove or di&s;approve of his behaviour to you.</P>
<P>His behaviour to me, Sir!&mdash;One hou&s;e cannot, &s;hall not, hold him and me.</P>
<P>I think, madam, that you &s;hould direct in this ar|ticle. I hope, after a little while, &s;o to order my af|fairs, as con&s;tantly to re&s;ide in England. I &s;hould think my&s;elf very happy if I could prevail upon Mr. Beauchamp to live with me.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;ee him, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P>Not, madam, unle&s;s you &s;hall think it right, for the &s;ake of the world's opinion, that you &s;hould.</P>
<P>I can't con&s;ent&mdash;</P>
<P>You <HI>can,</HI> madam! You <HI>do!</HI>&mdash;I cannot allow Lady Beauchamp to be one of tho&s;e women, who having in&s;i&s;ted upon a wrong point, can be convinced, yet not know how to recede with a grace.&mdash;Be &s;o kind to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> as to let Sir Harry know, that you think it right for Mr. Beauchamp to return; but that it mu&s;t be upon your own conditions: Then, madam, make tho&s;e conditions generous ones; and how will Sir Harry adore you! How will Mr. Beauchamp revere you! How &s;hall I e&s;teem you!</P>
<P>What a &s;trange impertinent have I before me!</P>
<P>I love to be called names by a lady. If unde&s;erv|edly, &s;he lays her&s;elf by them under obligation to me, which &s;he cannot be generous if &s;he re&s;olves not to repay. Shall I endeavour to find out Sir Harry? Or will you, madam?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
Was you ever, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, denied by any Woman to whom you &s;ued for favour?</P>
<P>I think, madam, I hardly ever was: But it was becau&s;e I never &s;ued for a favour, that it was not for a lady's honour to grant. This is the ca&s;e now; and this makes me determine, that I will not be denied the grant of my pre&s;ent reque&s;t. Come, come, ma|dam! How can a woman of your lady&s;hip's good &s;en&s;e (taking her hand, and leading her to the door) &s;eem to want to be per&s;uaded to do a thing &s;he knows in her heart to be right! Let us find Sir Harry.</P>
<P>Strange man!&mdash;Unhand me&mdash;<HI>He</HI> has us'd me un|kindly&mdash;</P>
<P>Overcome him then by your genero&s;ity. But, dear Lady Beauchamp, taking both her hands, and &s;miling confidently in her face [I could, my dear Dr. Bartlett, do &s;o to Lady Beauchamp] will you make me believe, that a woman of your &s;pirit (you have a charming &s;pirit, Lady Beacuhamp) did not give Sir Harry as much rea&s;on to complain, as he gave you?&mdash;I am &s;ure by his di&s;turbed countenance&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, you are downright affronting. Unhand me!&mdash;</P>
<P>This mi&s;under&s;tanding is owing to my officious let|ter. I &s;hould have waited on you in per&s;on. I &s;hould from the fir&s;t have put it in your power, to do a grace|ful and obliging thing. I a&s;k your pardon. I am not <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to make differences between man and wife.</P>
<P>I touched fir&s;t one hand, then the other, of the per|ver&s;e baby with my lips&mdash;Now am I forgiven: Now is my friend Beauchamp permitted to return to his na|tive country: Now are Sir Harry and his Lady recon|ciled&mdash;Come, come, madam, it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o&mdash;What fooli&s;h things are the quarrels of married people!&mdash;They mu&s;t come to an agreement again; and the &s;ooner the better; before hard blows are &s;truck, that will leave marks&mdash;Let us, dear madam, find out Sir Harry&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
And then with an air of vivacity, that women, whether in court&s;hip or out of it, di&s;like not, I was leading her once more to the door, and, as I intended, <HI>to</HI> Sir Harry, where ever he could be found.</P>
<P>Hold, hold, Sir, re&s;i&s;ting; but with features far more placid than &s;he had &s;uffered to be before vi&s;ible&mdash;If I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be compelled&mdash;You are a &s;trange man, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on&mdash;If I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be compelled to &s;ee Sir Harry&mdash;But you are a &s;trange man&mdash;And &s;he rang the bell.</P>
<P>Lady Beauchamp, Dr. Bartlett, is one of tho&s;e who would be more ready to forgive an innocent free|dom, than to be gratified by a profound re&s;pect; otherwi&s;e I had not treated her with &s;o little cere|mony. Such women are formidable only to tho&s;e who are afraid of their anger, or who make it a &s;eri|ous thing.</P>
<P>But when the &s;ervant appeared, &s;he not knowing how to conde&s;cend, I &s;aid, Go to your Ma&s;ter, Sir, and tell him that your Lady reque&s;ts the favour&mdash;<HI>Reque&s;ts the favour!</HI> repeated &s;he; but in a low voice: Which was no bad &s;ign.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant went with a me&s;&s;age worded with more civility than perhaps he was u&s;ed to carry to his ma&s;ter from his lady.</P>
<P>Now, dear Lady Beauchamp, for your own &s;ake; for Sir Harry's &s;ake; make happy and be happy. Are there not, dear madam, unhappine&s;&s;es enow in life, that we mu&s;t wilfully add to them?</P>
<P>Sir Harry came in fight. He &s;talked towards us with a parade like that of a young officer wanting to look martial at the head of his company.</P>
<P>Could I have &s;een him before he enter'd, my work would have been ea&s;ier. But his ho&s;tile air di&s;po&s;ed my Lady to renew ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>She turned her face a&s;ide, then her per&s;on; and the cloudy indignation with which &s;he entered at fir&s;t, again over&s;pread her features. Ought wrath, Dr.
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Bartlett, to be &s;o ready to attend a female will?&mdash;Surely, thought I, my Lady's pre&s;ent airs, after what has pa&s;&s;ed between her and me, can be only owing to the fear of making a precedent, and being thought too ea&s;ily per&s;uaded.</P>
<P>Sir Harry, &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to him, I have obtained Lady Beauchamp's pardon for the officious Letter&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Pardon,</HI> Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! You are a good man, and it was kindly intended&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going on: Anger from his eyes fla&s;hed up|on his cheek-bones, and made them &s;hine. My La|dy's eyes &s;truck fire at Sir Harry, and &s;hewed that &s;he was not <HI>afraid</HI> of him.</P>
<P>Better <HI>intended,</HI> than done, interrupted I, &s;ince my Lady tells me, that it was the occa&s;ion of a mi&s;|under&s;tanding&mdash;But, Sir, all will be right: My Lady a&s;&s;ures me, that you are not di&s;inclined to comply with the contents; and &s;he has the goodne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Charles, interrupted the Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>To give me hopes that &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>Will u&s;e her intere&s;t to confirm you in your favour|able Sentiments&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Harry cleared up at once&mdash;May I hope, ma|dam&mdash;And offered to take her hand.</P>
<P>She withdrew it with an air. O Dr. Bartlett, I mu&s;t have been thought an unpolite hu&s;band, had &s;he been my wife!</P>
<P>I took her hand. Excu&s;e this freedom, Sir Harry&mdash;For heaven's &s;ake, madam, whi&s;pering, Do what I know you <HI>will</HI> do, with a grace&mdash;Shall there be a mi&s;under&s;tanding, and the hu&s;band court a refu&s;ed hand?&mdash;I then forc'd her half unwillig hand into his, with an air that I intended &s;hould have both freedom and re&s;pect in it.</P>
<P>What a man have we got here, Sir Harry? This cannot be the mode&s;t man, that you have prai&s;ed to
<PB N="31" REF="32">
me&mdash;I thought a good man mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be ba&s;h|ful, if not &s;heepi&s;h: And here your vi&s;itor is the bolde&s;t man in England.</P>
<P><HI>The righteous,</HI> Lady Beauchamp, &s;aid Sir Harry, with an a&s;pect but half conceding, <HI>is hold as a lion.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>mu&s;t</HI> I be compelled thus, and by &s;uch a man, to forgive you, Sir Harry?&mdash;Indeed you were very un|kind.</P>
<P>And you, Lady Beauchamp, were very cruel.</P>
<P>I did not think, Sir, when I laid my fortune at your feet&mdash;</P>
<P>O Lady Beauchamp! You &s;aid cutting things&punc; <HI>Very</HI> cutting things.</P>
<P>And did not you, Sir Harry, &s;ay, It <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;o?&mdash;&s;o <HI>very</HI> peremptorily!</P>
<P>Not, madam, till you, <HI>as</HI> peremptorily&mdash;</P>
<P>A little recrimination, thought I, there mu&s;t be to keep each in countenance on their pa&s;t folly.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir Charles!&mdash;You may rejoice that you are not married, &s;aid Sir Harry.</P>
<P>Dear Sir Harry, &s;aid I, we mu&s;t bear with Ladies They are <HI>meek</HI> good creatures&mdash;They&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Meek!</HI> Sir Charles, repeated Sir Harry, with an half-angry &s;mile, and &s;hrugging, as if his &s;houlder had been hurt with his wife's meekne&s;s&mdash;I &s;ay, <HI>meek!</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;aid my Lady, with an air of threatening&mdash;</P>
<P>I was de&s;irous either of turning the Lady's di&s;plea|&s;ure into a je&s;t, or of diverting it from the fir&s;t ob|ject, in order to make her play with it, till &s;he had lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>Women are of gentle natures, pur&s;ued I, and, be|ing accu&s;tomed to be humoured, oppo&s;ition &s;its not ea&s;y upon them. Are they not kind to us, Sir Harry, when they allow of our &s;uperiority, by expecting us, to bear with their pretty perver&s;ene&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>O Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! &s;aid my Lady; both her hands lifted up.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
Let us be contented, proceeded I, with &s;uch their kind acknowlegements, and in pity to them, and in compliment to our&s;elves, bear with their foibles.&mdash;See, n adam, I ever was an advocate for the Ladies.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, I have no patience with you&mdash;</P>
<P>What can a poor Woman do, continued I, when oppo&s;ed? She can only be a little violent in <HI>words,</HI> and when &s;he has &s;aid as much as &s;he chu&s;es to &s;ay, be perhaps a little &s;ullen. For my part, were I &s;o happy as to call a woman mine, and &s;he <HI>happened</HI> to be in the wrong, I would endeavour to be in the right; and tru&s;t to her good &s;en&s;e to recover her tem|per: Arguments only beget arguments.&mdash;Tho&s;e re|conciliations are the mo&s;t durable, in which the Lady makes the advances.</P>
<P>What doctrine is this, Sir Charles? You are not the man I took you for.&mdash;I believe, in my con&s;cience, that you are not near &s;o good a man, as the world re|ports you.</P>
<P>What, madam, becau&s;e I pretend to know a little of the &s;ex? Surely, Lady Beauchamp, a man of common penetration may &s;ee to the bottom of a woman's heart. A cunning woman cannot hide it. A good woman will not. You are not, madam, &s;uch My&s;teries, as &s;ome of us think you. Whenever you know your <HI>own</HI> minds, <HI>we</HI> need not be long doubtful: That is <HI>all</HI> the difficulty: And I will vindicate you, as to that&mdash;</P>
<P>As how, pray, Sir?&mdash;</P>
<P>Women, madam, were de&s;igned to be <HI>dependent,</HI> as well as <HI>gentle,</HI> creatures; and of con&s;equence when left to their own wills, they know not what to re&s;olve upon.</P>
<P>I was hoping, Sir Charles, ju&s;t now, that you would &s;tay to dinner: But if you talk at this rate, I believe I &s;hall be ready to wi&s;h you out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Harry looked as if he were half-willing to be diverted at what pa&s;&s;ed between his lady and me.
<PB N="33" REF="34">
It was better for <HI>me</HI> to &s;ay what he could not but &s;ub|&s;cribe to by his feeling, than for him to &s;ay it.

This freedom of mine &s;eemed to &s;ave the married pair a good deal of recrimination.</P>
<P>You remind me, madam, that I mu&s;t be gone, ri|&s;ing and looking at my watch.</P>

<P>O the&s;e women! They are &s;o u&s;ed to court&s;hip, that they know not how to do right things without it&mdash;And, pardon, me, madam, not always with it.</P>

<P>Have you not, madam, given a <HI>Lady</HI>'s con&s;ent. <HI>That</HI> we men expect not to be very explicit, very gra|cious&mdash;It is from &s;uch <HI>non</HI> negative con&s;ents, that we men make &s;ilence an&s;wer all we wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I leave Sir Charles Grandi&s;on to manage this point, &s;aid Sir Harry. In my con&s;cience, I think the com|mon ob&s;ervation ju&s;t: A &s;tander-by &s;ees more of the game, than he that plays.</P>
<P>It ever will be &s;o, Sir Harry&mdash;But I will tell you, My Lady and I have as good as agreed the matter&mdash;</P>

<P>Dear Lady Beauchamp, re&s;umed I, depreciate not your compliment to Sir Harry. There wanted not con|trivance, I dare to hope (if there <HI>did,</HI> it had it not) to induce Lady Beauchamp to do a right, a kind, an obliging thing.</P>

<P>She was overcome: Yet pride had its &s;hare with genero&s;ity. You <HI>are,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, the Grandi&s;on I have heard of: But I will not be under obligations to you&mdash;not <HI>pecuniary</HI> ones, however. No, Sir Harry! Recal
<PB N="36" REF="37">
your &s;on: I will tru&s;t to your love: Do for him what you plea&s;e: Let him be independent on this <HI>in&s;olent</HI> man [She &s;aid this with a &s;mile, that made it oblige|ing]; and if we are to be vi&s;itors, friends, neigh|bours, let it be on an equal foot, and let him have nothing to reproach us with.</P>
<P>I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed at this emanation (&s;hall I call it?) of goodne&s;s. She is really not a bad woman, but a perver&s;e one: In &s;hort, one of tho&s;e who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, when rightly touched, are liable to &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing turn&mdash;.</P>
<P>Generous, charming Lady Beauchamp! &s;aid I: Now <HI>are</HI> you the woman, whom I have &s;o often heard prai&s;ed for many good qualities: Now will the portrait be a ju&s;t one!</P>
<P>Sir Harry was in raptures; but had like to have &s;poiled all, by making me a compliment on the force of example.</P>
<P>Be this, &s;aid I, the re&s;ult&mdash;Mr. Beauchamp comes over. He will be plea&s;ed with whatever you do: At your feet, madam, he &s;hall acknowlege your favour: My home &s;hall be his, if you permit it: On <HI>me,</HI> he &s;hall <HI>confer</HI> obligations; from <HI>you,</HI> he &s;hall receive them. If any con&s;iderations of family prudence (there <HI>are</HI> &s;uch, and very ju&s;t ones) re&s;train you from al|lowing him, at pre&s;ent what your genero&s;ity would wi&s;h to do.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady Beauchamp's colour was heightened: She in|terrupted me&mdash;We are not, Sir Charles, &s;o &s;canty in our fortune&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, my dear Lady Beauchamp, be all that as you will: Not one retro&s;pect of the pa&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, Sir Charles, but there &s;hall: His allowance has been le&s;&s;ened for &s;ome years; not from con&s;ider|ations of <HI>family prudence</HI>&mdash;But&mdash;Well, 'tis all at an end, proceeded &s;he&mdash;When the young man returns, you, Sir Harry, for my &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of this &s;trange anaccountable creature, &s;hall pay him the whole arrear.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
Now, my dear Lady Beauchamp,, &s;aid I, lifting her hand to my lips, permit me to give you joy. All doubts and mi&s;givings &s;o triumphantly got over, &s;o &s;o|lid a foundation laid for family harmony:&mdash;What was the moment of your nuptials to this? Sir Harry, I congratulate you: You may, and I believe you have been, as happy as mo&s;t men; but now, you will be &s;till happier.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir Harry, &s;aid &s;he, you provoked me in the morning: I &s;hould not el&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Harry own'd him&s;elf to blame; and thus the Lady's pride was &s;et down &s;oftly.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired Sir Harry to write, before the Day con|cluded, the invitation of return, to Mr. Beauchamp; and to do her all the credit in it that &s;he might claim from the la&s;t part of the conver&s;ation; but not to mention any-thing of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>She afterwards abated a little of this right &s;pirit, by &s;aying, I think, Sir Harry, you need not mention any|thing of the <HI>arrears,</HI> as I may call them&mdash;But only the future 600 <HI>l.</HI> a year. One would &s;urprize him a lit|tle, you know, and be twice thanked&mdash;</P>
<P>Surprizes of &s;uch a nature as this, my dear Dr. Bartlett; <HI>pecuniary</HI> &s;urprizes!&mdash;I don't love them&mdash;They are double taxes upon the gratitude of a worthy heart. Is it not enough for a generous mind to labour under a &s;en&s;e of obligation?&mdash;Pride, vain-glory, mu&s;t be the motive of &s;uch narrow-minded benefactors: A truly beneficent &s;pirit cannot take delight in behold|ing the quivering lip indicating the palpitating heart; in &s;eeing the downca&s;t countenance, the up-lifted hands, and working mu&s;cles, of a fellow-creature, who, but for unfortunate accidents, would perhaps him&s;elf have had the <HI>will</HI> with the <HI>power</HI> of &s;hewing a more graceful benevolence!</P>
<P>I was &s;o much afraid of hearing <HI>farther</HI> abatements of Lady Beauchamp's goodne&s;s; &s;o willing to depart with favourable impre&s;&s;ions of her for her own &s;ake;
<PB N="38" REF="39">
and at the &s;ame time &s;o de&s;irous to reach the Hall that night; that I got my&s;elf excu&s;ed, though with diffi|culty, &s;taying to dine; and, accepting of a di&s;h of chocolate, I parted with Sir Harry and my Lady, both in equal good humour with them&s;elves and me.</P>
<P>Could you have thought, my dear friend, that I &s;hould have &s;ucceeded &s;o very happily, as I have done, in this affair, and at one meeting?</P>
<P>I think that the father and &s;tep-mother &s;hould have the full merit with our Beauchamp of a turn &s;o unex|pected. Let him not therefore ever &s;ee this letter, that he may take his impre&s;&s;ion of the favour done him, from that which Sir Harry will write to him.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Grandi&s;on, whom I hoped to find here, left the Hall on Tue&s;day la&s;t, tho' he knew of my in|tention to be down. I am &s;orry for it. Poor Everard! He has been a great while pretty good. I am afraid he will get among his old acquaintance; and then we &s;hall not hear of him for &s;ome months perhaps. If you &s;ee him in town, try to engage him, till I return. I &s;hould be glad of his company to Paris, if his going with me, will keep him out of harm's way, as it is called.</P>

<P>I HAVE had compliments &s;ent me by many of my neighbours, who had hoped I was come to re&s;ide among them. They profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves di&s;appointed on my acquainting them, that I mu&s;t go up early on Monday morning. I have invited my&s;elf to their Sa|turday A&s;&s;embly at the Bowling green-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Our reverend friend Mr. Dob&s;on has been &s;o good as to leave with me the Sermon he is to preach to|morrow on the opening of the church: It is a very good di&s;cour&s;e: I have only exceptions to three or four compliments he makes to the patron, in as many diffe|rent places of it: I doubt not but he will have the goodne&s;s to omit them.</P>
<P>I have already looked into all that has been done in
<PB N="39" REF="40">
the church; and all that is doing in the hou&s;e and gardens. When both have had the direction and in|&s;pection of my dear Dr. Bartlett, need I &s;ay, that no|thing could have been better?</P>
<P>HALDEN is ju&s;t arrived from my Lord, with a Let|ter, which has enabled me to write to Lady Mansfield his Lord&s;hip's high approbation of all our proceedings; and that he intends &s;ome one early day in next week to pay to her, and Mi&s;s Mansfield, his per&s;onal com|pliments.</P>
<P>He has left to me the article of Settlements; de|claring, that his regard for my future intere&s;t is all that he wi&s;hes may be attended to.</P>
<P>I have therefore written as from him&s;elf, that he pro|po&s;es a jointure of 1200 <HI>l.</HI> a year, peny-rents, and 400 guineas a year for her private pur&s;e; and that his Lord&s;hip de&s;ires, that Mi&s;s Mansfield will make a pre&s;ent to her &s;i&s;ter of whatever &s;he may be intitled to in her own right. Something was mentioned to me at Man&s;|field-hou&s;e of a thou&s;and pounds left to her by a god|mother.</P>
<P>Halden being very de&s;irous to &s;ee his future Lady, I &s;hall, at his reque&s;t, &s;end the Letter I have written to Lady Mansfield by him early in the morning; with a line recommending him to the notice of that Lady as Lord W's principal &s;teward</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Dr. Bartlett: I have joy in the joy of all the&s;e good people. If Providence graciou&s;ly makes me in&s;trumental to it, I look upon my&s;elf <HI>but</HI> as its <HI>in&s;trument.</HI> I hope o&s;tentation has no &s;hare in what draws on me more thanks and prai&s;es than I love to hear.</P>
<P>Lord W. has a right to be made happy by his next relation, if his next relation <HI>can</HI> make him &s;o. Is he not my mother's brother? Would not her enlarged &s;oul have rejoiced on the occa&s;ion, and ble&s;&s;ed her &s;on for an in&s;tance of duty to her, paid by his di&s;in|tere&s;ted

<P>THE Counte&s;s of D. and the Earl her &s;on have but ju&s;t left us. The Counte&s;s &s;ent la&s;t night, to let my cou&s;in Reeves know of their intended morning vi&s;it, and they came together. As the vi&s;it was made to my cou&s;in, I did not think my&s;elf obliged to be in wait|ing for them below. I was therefore in my clo&s;et, comforting my&s;elf with my own <HI>agreeable</HI> reflexions. They were there a quarter of an hour before I was &s;ent to.</P>
<P>Their talk was of me. I am u&s;ed to recite my own prai&s;es, you know; and what &s;ignifies making a pa|rade of apologies for continuing the u&s;e? I don't va|lue my&s;elf &s;o much as I once did on people's favourable opinions. If I had a heart in my own keeping, I &s;hould be glad it was thought a good one; that's all. Yet tho' it has littlene&s;&s;es in it, that I knew nothing of formerly, I hope it is not a bad one.</P>
<P>My Lord D. by the whole turn of the partial con|ver&s;ation, was led to expect a very extraordinary young woman. The Lady declared, that &s;he would have her talk out, and hear all my two cou&s;ins were inclin|ed to &s;ay of me, before I was &s;ent up to, as I was not below when they came.</P>
<P>I was therefore to be &s;een only as a &s;ubject of curi|o&s;ity. My Lord had declared, it &s;eems, that he would not be denied an introduction to me by his mo|ther. But there were no thoughts of making any ap|plication to a girl who&s;e heart was acknowleged
<PB N="41" REF="42">
not to be her own. My Lord's honour would not al|low of &s;uch an intention. Nor ought it.</P>
<P>His impatience, however, ha&s;tened the me&s;&s;age to me. The Counte&s;s met me half-way, and embraced me: My lovely girl, how do you?&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, turning to the Earl, I need not &s;ay, This is Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>He bowed low, and made me a very high compli|ment; but it had &s;en&s;e in it, tho' high, and above my merits. Girls, writing of them&s;elves on the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, mu&s;t be di&s;claimers, you know: But, my dear uncle, what care I <HI>now</HI> for compliments? The man, from who&s;e mouth only they could be acceptable, is not at liberty to make me any.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s engaged me in an ea&s;y general con|ver&s;at on; part of which turned upon Lord and Lady L. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and Mi&s;s Jervois, and how I had pa&s;&s;ed my time at Colnebrooke, in this wintry &s;ea&s;on, when there were &s;o many diver&s;ions in town. But, &s;aid &s;he, you had a man with you, who is the admiration of every man and woman, where ever he goes.</P>
<P>Is there no making an acquaintance, &s;aid my Lord, with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? What I hear &s;aid of him, every time he is mentioned in company, is enough to fire a young man with emulation. I &s;hould be happy did I de&s;erve to be thought of as a &s;econd or third man to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, returned I, your Lord&s;hip's acquaintance would be highly acceptable to him. He is ea&s;y of ac|ce&s;s. Men of rank, if men of merit, mu&s;t be of kindred, and recognize one another the moment they meet. But Sir Charles will &s;oon leave England.</P>
<P>The fool &s;ighed: It was, you may believe, involun|tarily. I felt my&s;elf blu&s;h, and was the more &s;illy for that.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s took my hand&mdash;One word with you, my dear&mdash;and led me out into the next room, and &s;it|ting down, made me &s;it on the &s;ame &s;ettee with her.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">
O that I could call you daughter! began &s;he at once; and turning half round to me, put one arm about me, with her other hand taking one of mine, and ear|ne&s;tly looking in my downca&s;t face.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent.&mdash;Ah, Lucy! had Lady D. been the mother of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, with what plea&s;ure could I have li&s;tened to her!</P>
<P>You &s;aid, my dear, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on will &s;oon leave England: And then you &s;ighed&mdash;Will you be quite open-hearted?&mdash;May I a&s;k you a que&s;tion in hope that you will?</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent: Yet the word Yes, was on my lips.</P>
<P>You have cau&s;ed it to be told me, that your affecti|ons are engaged. This has been a cruel blow upon us. My Lord, neverthele&s;s, has heard &s;o much of you [He is reall a good young man, my dear], that (again&s;t my advice&punc; I own) he would have me intro|duce him into your company. I &s;ee by his looks, that he could admire you above all women. <HI>He never was in love:</HI> I &s;hould be &s;orry if he were di&s;appointed in his fir&s;t love. I hope his <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> prudence will be his guard, if there be no pro&s;pect of his &s;ucceeding with you&mdash;She pau&s;ed&mdash;I was &s;till &s;ilent&mdash;</P>
<P>It will be a mark of your frankne&s;s of heart, my dear, if, when you take my full meaning, you pre|vent me &s;peaking more than I need. I would not op|pre&s;s you, my &s;weet love&mdash;Such a delicacy, and &s;uch a frankne&s;s mingled, have I never &s;een in young wo|man&mdash;But tell me, my dear, has Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on made his addre&s;&s;es to you?</P>
<P>It was a grievous que&s;tion for me to an&s;wer&mdash;But <HI>why</HI> was it &s;o, my Lucy, when all the hopes I ever had, proceeded from my own pre&s;umption, confirmed (that's true, of late!) by his &s;i&s;ters partiality in my favour; and when his unhappy Clementina has &s;uch a a preferable claim?</P>
<P>What &s;ays Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>She &s;ays, madam, that &s;he reveres Lady D. and
<PB N="43" REF="44">
will an&s;wer any que&s;tions that &s;he puts to her, how|ever affecting&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has not.</P>
<P>Once I thought proceeded &s;he, that I never would make a &s;econd motion, were the woman a prince&s;s, who had confe&s;&s;ed a prior love, or even liking: But the man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, whom all women mu&s;t e&s;teem; and the woman is Mi&s;s Byron, whom all men mu&s;t love. Let me a&s;k you, my dear&mdash;Have you any expectation, that the fir&s;t of men (I will call him &s;o) and the lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t amiable-minded of women, can come together?&mdash;You &s;ighed, you know, when you mentioned, that Sir Charles was &s;oon to leave England; and you own that he has not made addre&s;&s;es to you&mdash;Don't be unea&s;y, my love!&mdash;We women, in the&s;e tender ca&s;es, &s;ee into each other's hearts from &s;mall openings&mdash;Look upon me as your mother&mdash;What &s;ay you, love?</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip compliments me with delicacy and frankne&s;s&mdash;It is too hard a que&s;tion, if I have any of the fir&s;t to an&s;wer without blu&s;hes. A young woman to be &s;uppo&s;ed to have an e&s;teem for a man, who has made no declarations, and who&s;e behaviour to her is &s;uch only as &s;hews a politene&s;s to which he is accu|&s;tomed, and only the &s;ame kind of tenderne&s;s as he &s;hews to his &s;i&s;ter;&mdash;and whom &s;ometimes he <HI>calls</HI> &s;i&s;ter&mdash;as if&mdash;Ah, madam, how can one an&s;wer?</P>
<P>You <HI>have</HI> an&s;wered, my dear, and with that deli|cacy and frankne&s;s too&punc; which make a principal part of your character. If my &s;on (and he &s;hall not be encouraged in his hopes, if he &s;ees you not, mind as well as per&s;on, with his mother's eyes) &s;hould not be able to check him&s;elf, by the apprehen&s;ions he has had rea&s;on for, of being but a &s;econd man in the fa|vour of the object of his wi&s;hes <HI>[We,</HI> my dear, have our delicacies] could you not allow him a &s;econd place in your favour, that might, in time, as he &s;hould merit, and as you &s;hould &s;ubdue your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, give him a fir&s;t?&mdash;Hu&s;h&mdash;my dear, for one moment&mdash;
<PB N="44" REF="45">
Your honour, your piety, are my ju&s;t dependence; and will be his.&mdash;And now &s;peak: It is to <HI>me,</HI> my dear: Speak your whole heart: Let not any appre|hended difficulty&mdash;I am a woman as well as you. And prepared to indulge&mdash;</P>
<P>Your <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> madam, and nothing el&s;e, interrupt|ed I, gives me difficulty.&mdash;My Lord D. &s;eems to me to be a man of merit, and not a di&s;agreeable man in his per&s;on and manners. What he &s;aid of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and of his emulation being fired by his ex|ample, gave him additional merit with me. He mu&s;t have a good mind. I wi&s;h him acquainted with Sir Charles, for his own &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of the world, which might be benefited by his large power, &s;o hap|pily directed!&mdash;But as to my&s;elf, I &s;hould forfeit the character of frankne&s;s of heart, which your Lady&s;hip's goodne&s;s a&s;cribes to me, if I did not declare, that altho' I cannot, and, I think, <HI>ought not,</HI> to entertain an hope with regard to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;ince there is a Lady who de&s;erved him by &s;evere &s;ufferings before I knew him; yet is my heart &s;o wholly attached, that I cannot think it ju&s;t to give the lea&s;t encouragement to any other propo&s;al.</P>
<P>You are an excellent young woman: But, my dear, if Charles Grandi&s;on is engaged&mdash;your mind will, it, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> change. Few women marry their fir&s;t loves. Your heart&mdash;</P>
<P>O madam! it is <HI>already</HI> a wedded heart: It is wedded to his merits; his merits will be <HI>always</HI> the object of my e&s;teem: I can never think of any <HI>other,</HI> as I <HI>ought</HI> to think of the man to whom I give my hand.</P>
<P>Like merits, my dear, as <HI>per&s;on</HI> is not the principal motive, may produce like attachments. My Lord D. will be, in your hands, another Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on.</P>
<P>How good you are, my dear Lady D.! But allow me to repeat, as the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ion I can u&s;e, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="46">
I mean it to carry in it all the force that can be given it, That my heart is already a wedded heart.</P>
<P>You have &s;poken with great force: God ble&s;s you, my dear, as I love you! The matter &s;hall take its cour&s;e. If my Lord &s;hould happen to be a &s;ingle man &s;ome time hence (and, I can tell you, that your excel|lencies will make our choice difficult); and if your mind, from any accident, or from per&s;ua&s;ion of friends, &s;hould then have received alteration; you may &s;till be happy in each other. I will therefore only thank you for that openne&s;s of heart&punc; which mu&s;t &s;et free the heart of my &s;on&mdash;Had you had the lea&s;t lurking inclination to coquetry, and could have taken pride in conque&s;ts, he might have been an undone man.&mdash;We will return to the company&mdash;But &s;pare him, my dear: You mu&s;t not talk much. He will love you, if you do, too fer|vently for his own peace. Try to be a little auk|ward&mdash;I am afraid for him: Indeed I am. O that you had never &s;een Sir Charles Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer one word. She took my hand; and led me into the company.</P>
<P>Had I been &s;ilent, when my Lord directed his di&s;|cour&s;e to me, or an&s;wer'd only No, or Yes, the Counte&s;s would have thought me very vain; and, that I a&s;cribed to my&s;elf the con&s;equence &s;he &s;o generou&s;ly gave me, with re&s;pect to my Lord. I therefore be|haved and an&s;wered unaffectedly: but avoided &s;uch a promptne&s;s of &s;peech, as would have looked like making preten&s;ions to knowlege and opinion, though &s;ome of my Lord's que&s;tions were apparently de&s;ign'd to engage me into freedom of di&s;cour&s;e. The Counte&s;s ob&s;erved me narrowly. She whi&s;pered to me, that &s;he <HI>did;</HI> and made me a very high compliment on my behaviour. How much, Lucy, do I love and reve|rence her!</P>
<P>My Lord was &s;poken too &s;lightly of, by Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, in a former conver&s;ation He is really a fine gentleman. Any woman who is not engaged in her
<PB N="46" REF="47">
affections, may think her&s;elf very happy with him. His conver&s;ation was ea&s;y and polite, and he &s;aid no|thing that was low or trifling. Indeed, Lucy, I think Mr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick are as greatly inferior to Lord D. as Lord D. is to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on</P>
<P>At parting, he reque&s;ted of me, to be allowed to repeat his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, before I could an&s;wer, you mu&s;t not expect a mere &s;tiff maiden an&s;wer from Mi&s;s Byron: She is above all vulgar forms. She and her cou&s;ins have too much politene&s;s, and, I will ven|ture to &s;ay, di&s;cernment, not to be glad of your ac|quaintance, <HI>as</HI> an acquaintance&mdash;But, for the re&s;t, you mu&s;t look to your heart.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be afraid&punc; &s;aid he&punc; turning to the Counte&s;s, to a&s;k your Lord&s;hip for an explanation. Mi&s;s Byron, I hope, Sir, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Reeves, will not refu&s;e me her company, when I pay you my com|pliments. Then turning to me, I hope, madam, I &s;hall not be puni&s;hed for admiring you.</P>
<P>My Lord D. replied I, will be intitled to every ci|vility. I had &s;aid more, had he not &s;natched my hand a little too eagerly, and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>And thus much for the vi&s;it of the Counte&s;s of D. and the Earl.</P>
<P>DID I tell you in my former letter, that Emily is with me half her time? She is a mo&s;t engaging young creature. Her manners are &s;o pure! Her heart is &s;o &s;incere and open!&mdash;O Lucy! you would dearly love her. I wi&s;h I may be a&s;ked to carry her down with me. Yet &s;he adores her guardian: But her reverence for him will not allow of the innocent familiarity in thinking of him, that&mdash;I don't know what I would &s;ay. But to love with an ardor, that would be dan|gerous to one's peace, one mu&s;t have more tender|ne&s;s than reverence for the object: Don't you think &s;o, Lucy?</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">
Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on made me one of her flying vi&s;its, as &s;he calls them, &s;oon after the Counte&s;s and my Lord went away.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Reeves told her all that had been &s;aid before them by the Earl and Counte&s;s, as well before I went down to them, as after. They could not tell her what pa&s;&s;ed between that Lady and me, when &s;he took me a&s;ide. I had not had time to tell <HI>them.</HI> They referred to me for that: But be&s;ides that I was not in &s;pirits, and cared not to &s;ay much, I was not willing to be thought by my refu&s;al of &s;o great an offer, to &s;eem to fa&s;ten my&s;elf upon her brother.</P>
<P>She pitied (Who but mu&s;t?) Lady Clementina. She pitied her brother al&s;o: And, &s;eeing me dejected, &s;he cla&s;ped her arms about me, and wet my cheek with a &s;i&s;terly tear.</P>
<P>Is it not very &s;trange, Lucy, that <HI>his</HI> father &s;hould keep him &s;o long abroad? The&s;e free-living men! What ab&s;urdities are they not guilty of? What misfor|tunes to others do they not occa&s;ion? One might, with the excellent Clementina, a&s;k, What had Mr. Grandi&s;on to do in Italy? Or why, if he mu&s;t go abroad, did he &s;tay &s;o long?</P>
<P>Travelling! Young men travelling! I cannot, my dear, but think it a very non&s;en&s;ical thing! What can they &s;ee, but the ruins of the gay, once bu&s;y world, of which they have read?</P>
<P>To &s;ee a parcel of giddy boys, under the direction of tutors, or governors, hunting after&mdash;What?&mdash;No|thing; or at be&s;t but ruins of ruins; for the imagina|tion, aided by reflection, mu&s;t be le&s;t, after all, to make out the greater glories which the grave-digger Time has buried too deep for di&s;covery.</P>
<P>And when this <HI>grand tour</HI> is completed, the travell'd youth returns: And, what is his boa&s;t? Why to be able to tell, perhaps his <HI>better</HI>-taught friend, who has never been out of his native country, that he has &s;een in ruins, what the other has a ju&s;ter idea of from read|ing:
<PB N="48" REF="49">
And of which, it is more than probable he can give a much better account than the traveiler.</P>
<P>And are the&s;e, petulant Harriet (methinks, Lucy, you demand) all the benefits, that you will &s;uppo&s;e Sir CHARLES GRANDISON has reaped from his tra|velling?</P>
<P>Why, no. But then, in turn, I a&s;k, Is every tra|veller a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?&mdash;And does not even <HI>he</HI> confe&s;s to Dr. Bartlett, that he wi&s;hed he had never &s;een Italy? And may not the poor Clementina, and all her family&punc; for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake&punc; wi&s;h he never had?</P>
<P>If an opportunity offers, I don't know, but I may a&s;k Sir Charles, Whether, in his con&s;cience, he thinks that, taking in every con&s;ideration, relating to time, expence, ri&s;ques of life, health, morals&punc; this part of the fa&s;hionable education of youth of condition is &s;uch an indi&s;pen&s;able one, as &s;ome &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e it? If Sir Charles Grandi&s;on give it not in favour of travel|ling, I believe it will be concluded, that &s;ix parts out of eight of the little ma&s;ters who are &s;ent abroad for im|provement, might as well be kept at home; if, e&s;pe|cially, they would be <HI>orderly,</HI> and let their fathers and mothers know what to do with them.</P>
<P>O my uncle! I am afraid of you: But &s;pare the poor girl: She acknowleges her petulance, her pre&s;umpti|on. The occa&s;ion you know, and will pity her for it! However, neither petulance nor pre&s;umption &s;hall make her declare as her &s;entiments what really are not &s;o, in her unprejudiced hours; and &s;he hopes to have her heart always open to conviction.</P>

<P>SIR Charles Grandi&s;on came to town la&s;t night. He was &s;o polite, as to &s;end to enquire after my health; and to let Mr. Reeves know, that he would do him&s;elf the honour, as he called it, of breakfa&s;ting with <HI>him</HI> this morning. Very ceremonious either for his own &s;ake or for mine&mdash;Perhaps for both.</P>
<P>So I am in expectation of &s;eeing within this half|hour, the noble Clementina's future&mdash;Ah Lucy!</P>
<P>The compliment, you &s;ee, is to Mr. Reeves&mdash;Shall I &s;tay above, and &s;ee if he will a&s;k for me? He owes me &s;omething for the emotion he gave me in Lord L.'s library. Very little of him &s;ince have I &s;een.</P>

<P>But <HI>I cannot be unju&s;t:</HI>&mdash;To Clementina he means. Who <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> him to be &s;o?&mdash;<HI>Unju&s;t!</HI> I hope not. It is a diminution to your glory, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, to have the word <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> in this way of &s;peaking, in your thoughts!

<P>Well, but breakfa&s;t-time is come, while I am bu&s;y in &s;elf-debatings. I will go down, that I may not &s;eem to affect parade.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>O LUCY, I have &s;uch a conver&s;ation to relate to you!&mdash;But let me lead to it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles met me at the opening of the door. He was all him&s;elf. Such an unaffected mode&s;ty and po|litene&s;s; yet &s;uch an ea&s;e and freedom!</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
I thought by his addre&s;s, that he would have taken my hand; and both hands were <HI>&s;o emulatively</HI> pa&s;&s;ive.&mdash;How does he manage it to be &s;o free in a fir&s;t addre&s;s, yet &s;o re&s;pectful, that a prince&s;s could not blame him?</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, my cou&s;ins being &s;ent for out to attend Sir John Alle&s;tree and his Niece, Sir Charles and I were left alone: And then, with an air equally &s;olemn and free, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time I had the honour of being alone with my good Mi&s;s Byron, I told her a very tender tale. I was &s;ure it would rai&s;e in &s;uch a heart as hers generous compa&s;&s;ion for the noble&s;t lady on the Con|tinent; and I pre&s;umed, as my difficulties were not owing either to ra&s;hne&s;s or indi&s;cretion, that &s;he would al&s;o pity the relator.</P>
<P>The &s;tory did indeed affect you; yet, for my own &s;ake, as well as yours, I referred you to Dr. Bartlett, for the particulars of &s;ome parts of it, upon which I could not expatiate.</P>
<P>The doctor, madam, has let me know the parti|culars which he communicated to you. I remember with pain the pain I gave to your generous heart in Lord L.'s &s;tudy. I am &s;ure you mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;till more from the &s;ame compa&s;&s;ionate goodne&s;s on the communications he made you. May I, madam how|ever, add a few particulars to the &s;ame &s;ubject, which he then could not give you? Now you have been let into &s;o con&s;iderable a part of my &s;tory, I am de&s;irous to acquaint you, and that rather than any woman in the world, with all that I know my&s;elf of this ardu|ous affair.</P>
<P>He cea&s;ed &s;peaking. I was in tremors. Sir, Sir&mdash;The &s;tory I mu&s;t own, is a mo&s;t affecting one. How much is the unhappy lady to be pitied! You will do me honour in acquainting me with farther particulars of it.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett has told you, madam, that the Bi&s;hop of Nocera, &s;econd brother to Lady Clementina, his
<PB N="52" REF="53">
very lately written to me, reque&s;ting that I will make one more vi&s;it to Bologna&mdash;I have the Letter. You read Italian, madam. Shall I&mdash;Or will you&mdash;He held it to me.</P>
<P>I took it. The&s;e, Lucy, are the contents.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The bi&s;hop acquaints him with the very melan|choly way they are in. The father and mother de|clining in their healths. Signor Jeronymo wor&s;e than when Sir Charles le&s;t them. His Si&s;ter al&s;o declining in her health: Yet earne&s;t &s;till to &s;ee him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He &s;ays, That &s;he is at pre&s;ent at Urbino; but is &s;oon to go to Naples to the General's. He urges him to make them one vi&s;it more; yet owns, that his family are not unanimous in the reque&s;t: But that he and Father Mare&s;cotti, and the Marchio|ne&s;s, are extremely earne&s;t that this indulgence &s;hould be granted to the wi&s;hes of his dear Si&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He offers to meet him, at his own appointment, and conduct him to Bologna; where, he tells him, his pre&s;ence will rejoice every heart, and procure an unanimous con&s;ent to the enterview &s;o much de&s;ired: And &s;ays, that if this mea&s;ure, which he is &s;orry he has &s;o long with&s;tood, an&s;wers not his hopes, he will advi&s;e the &s;hutting up of their Clementina in a Nunnery, or to con&s;ign her to private hands, where &s;he &s;hall be treated kindly, but as per&s;ons in her unhappy circum&s;tances are accu&s;tomed to be treated.'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles then &s;hewed me a Letter from Signor Je|ronymo; in which he acquaints him with the danger|ous way he is in. He tells him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That his life is a burden to him. He wi&s;hes it was brought to its period. He does not think him&s;elf in &s;kilful hands. He complains mo&s;t of the wound which is in his hip-joint and which has hitherto ba&s;&s;led the art both of the Italian and French &s;urgeons who have been con&s;ulted. He wi&s;hes, that him&s;elf and Sir Charles had been of one country, he &s;ays, &s;ince
<PB N="53" REF="54">
the greate&s;t felicity he now has to wi&s;h for, is to yield up his life to the Giver of it, in the arms of his Grandi&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>He mentions not one word in this melancholy Let|ter of his unhappy &s;i&s;ter: Which Sir Charles account|ed for, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that &s;he not being at Bologna, they kept from him, in his deplorable way, every|thing relating to her, that was likely to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>He then read part of a Letter written in Engli&s;h, by the admired Mrs. Beaumont; &s;ome of the contents of which were, as you &s;hall hear, extremely affect|ing:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mrs. Beaumont gives him in it an account of the &s;ituation of the unhappy young lady; and excu&s;es her&s;elf for not having done it before, in an&s;wer to his reque&s;t, by rea&s;on of an indi&s;po&s;ition under which &s;he had for &s;ome time laboured, which had hindered her from making the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She mentions, that the Lady had received no be|nefit from her journeyings from place to place; and from her voyage from Leghorn to Naples, and back again; and blames her attendants, who to quiet her, unknown to their principals, for &s;ome time, kept her in expectation of &s;eeing her Chevalier, at the end of each; for her more prudent Camilla, &s;he &s;ays, had been hinder'd by illne&s;s from attending her, in &s;everal of the excur&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'They had a &s;econd time, at her own reque&s;t, put her into a Nunnery. She at fir&s;t was &s;o &s;edate in it as gave them hopes: But the novelty going off, and one of the &s;i&s;ters, to try her, having officiou&s;ly a&s;ked her to go with her into the parlour, where &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would be allowed to conver&s;e through the grate with a <HI>certain</HI> Engli&s;h gentleman, her impatience, on her di&s;appointment, made her more ungovern|able than they had ever known her; for &s;he had been for two hours before meditating what &s;he would &s;ay to him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'For a week together, &s;he was vehemently intent upon being allowed to vi&s;it England; and had en|gaged her cou&s;ins, Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, to pro|mi&s;e to e&s;cort her thither, if &s;he could obtain leave.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Her mother brought her off this when nobody el&s;e could, only by intreating her, for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, ne|ver to think of it more.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Marchione&s;s then, encouraged by this in|&s;tance of her obedience, took her under her own care: But the young Lady going on from flight to flight; and the way &s;he was in vi&s;ibly affecting the health of her indulgent mother; a doctor was found, who was ab&s;olutely of opinion, that nothing but har&s;h methods would avail: And in this advice Lady Sforza, and her daughter Laurana, and the General, concurring, &s;he was told, that &s;he mu&s;t prepare to go to Milan. She was &s;o earne&s;t to be excu&s;ed from going thither, and to be permitted to go to Florence to Mrs. Beaumont, that they gave way to her en|treaties; and the Marquis him&s;elf, accompanying her to Florence, prevailed on Mrs. Beaumont to take her under her care.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'With her &s;he &s;taid three weeks: She was tolerably &s;edate in that &s;pace of time; but mo&s;t &s;o, when &s;he was talking of England, and of the Chevalier Gran|di&s;on, and his &s;i&s;ters, with whom &s;he wi&s;hed to be acquainted. She delighted to &s;peak Engli&s;h, and to talk of the tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s of her tutor; and of what he had &s;aid to her, upon &s;uch and &s;uch a &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'At the three weeks end, the General made her a vi&s;it, in company of Lady Sforza; and her talk be|ing all on this &s;ubject, they were both highly di&s;|plea&s;ed; and hinted, that &s;he was too much in|dulged in it; and, unhappily, &s;he repeating &s;ome tender pa&s;&s;ages that pa&s;&s;ed in the interview her mo|ther had permitted her to hold with the Chevalier,
<PB N="55" REF="56">
the General would have it, that Mr. Grandi&s;on had de&s;ignedly, from the fir&s;t, &s;ought to give him&s;elf con|&s;equence with her; and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, on the occa&s;ion, with great violence again&s;t him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He carried his di&s;plea&s;ure to extremity, and oblig|ed her to go away with his aunt and him that very day, to her great regret; and as much to the regret of Mrs. Beaumont, and of the Ladies her friends; who tenderly loved the <HI>innocent vi&s;ionary,</HI> as &s;ome|times they called her. And Mrs. Beaumont is &s;ure, that the gentle treatment &s;he met with from them, would in time, tho' perhaps &s;lowly, have greatly help|ed her.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont then gives an account of the har&s;h treatment the poor young Lady met with.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on would have &s;topt reading here. He &s;aid, he could not read it to me, without &s;uch a change of voice, as would add to my pain, as well as to his own.</P>
<P>Tears often &s;tole down my cheeks, when I read the Letters of the Bi&s;hop and Signor Jeronymo, and as Sir Charles read a part of Mrs. Beaumont's Letter: And I doubted not but what was to follow would make them flow. Yet, I &s;aid, Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to let <HI>me</HI> read on. I am not a &s;tranger to di&s;tre&s;s. I can pi|ty others, or I &s;hould not de&s;erve pity my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He pointed to the place; and withdrew to the win|dow.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the poor mother was prevailed upon to re&s;ign her child wholly to the ma|nagement of Lady Sforza, and her daughter Lau|rana, who took her with them to their Palace in Mi|lan.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The tender parent, however, be&s;ought them to &s;pare all unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity; which they promi&s;ed: But Laurana objected to Camilla's attendance. She was thought too indulgent; and her &s;ervant Laura, as a more manageable per&s;on, was taken in her place'</Q>.
<PB N="56" REF="57">
And O how cruelly, as you &s;hall hear, did they treat her!</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti, being obliged to vi&s;it a dying re|lation at Milan, was de&s;ired by the Marchione&s;s to in|form him&s;elf of the way her beloved daughter was in, and of the methods taken with her, Lady Laurana having in her Letters boa&s;ted of both. The good Fa|ther acquainted Mrs. Beaumont with the following par|ticulars:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He was &s;urpri&s;ed to find a difficulty made of his &s;eeing the Lady: But in&s;i&s;ting on it, he found her to be wholly &s;piritle&s;s, and in terror; afraid to &s;peak, afraid to look, before her cou&s;in Laurana; yet &s;eem|ing to want to complain to him. He took notice of this to Laurana&mdash;O Father, &s;aid &s;he, we are in the right way, I a&s;&s;ure you: When we had her fir&s;t, her Chevalier, and an interview with him, were ever in her mouth; but now &s;he is in &s;uch order, that &s;he never &s;peaks a word of him. But what, a&s;ked the compa&s;&s;ionate Father, mu&s;t &s;he have &s;uffer|ed, to be brought to this? Don't you, Father, trou|ble your&s;elf about that, replied the cruel Laurana: The doctors have given their opinion, that &s;ome &s;e|verity was nece&s;&s;ary. It is all for her good.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The poor Lady expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him, with earne&s;tne&s;s, after the veil; a &s;ubject on which, it &s;eems, they indulged her; urging, that the only way to &s;ecure her health of mind, if it could be re|&s;tored, was to yield to her wi&s;hes. Lady Sforza &s;aid, that it was not a point that &s;he her&s;elf would pre&s;s; but it was her opinion, that her family &s;inned in oppo&s;ing a divine dedication; and, perhaps, their daughter's malady might be a judgment upon them for it.</Q></P>
<P>The Father, in his Letter to Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'a&s;cribes to Lady Sforza &s;elf-intere&s;ted motives for her conduct; to Laurana, envy on account of Lady
<PB N="57" REF="58">
Clementina's &s;uperior qualities; But nobody, he &s;ays, till now, doubted Laurana's love of her.'</Q></P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti then gives a &s;hocking in&s;tance of the barbarous Laurana's treatment of the noble &s;uf|ferer&mdash;<HI>All for her good</HI>&mdash;Wretch! how my heart ri&s;es again&s;t her! Her &s;ervant Laura, under pretence of con&s;e&s;&s;ing to her Bologna Father, in tears, acquainted him with it. It was perpetrated but the day before.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'When any &s;everity was to be exerci&s;ed upon the unhappy Lady, Laura was always &s;hut out of her apartment. Her Lady had &s;aid &s;omething that &s;he was to be chidden for. Lady Sforza, who was not altogether &s;o &s;evere as her daughter, was not at home. Laura li&s;tned in tears: She heard Laurana in great wrath with Lady Clementina, and threaten her&mdash;and her young Lady break out to this effect&mdash;What have I done to you, Laurana, to be &s;o u&s;ed?&mdash;You are not the cou&s;in Laurana you u&s;ed to be? You know I am not able to help my&s;elf: Why do you call me crazy, and frantic Laurana; [Vile upbraider, Lucy!] If the Almighty has laid his upon me, &s;hould I not be pitied?&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It is all for your good! It is all for your good, Clementina! You could not always have &s;poken &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, cou&s;in.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Cruel Laurana! You loved me once! I have no Mother, as you have. My Mother was a good Mother: But &s;he is gone! Or I am gone, I know not which!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She threatned her then with the Strait Wai&s;t|coat, a puni&s;hment which the unhappy Lady was always greatly terrified at. Laura heard her beg and pray, but, Laurana coming out, &s;he was forced to retire.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The poor young Lady apprehending her cruel cou&s;in's return with the threatned wai&s;tcoat, and with the woman that u&s;ed to be brought in when they were di&s;po&s;ed to terrify her, went down and
<PB N="58" REF="59">
hid her&s;elf uuder a &s;tair-ca&s;e, where &s;he was &s;oon di&s;covered by her cloaths, which &s;he had not been careful to draw in after her.'</Q></P>
<P>O! Lucy! how I wept! How in&s;upportable to me, &s;aid Sir Charles, would have been my reflexions, had my con&s;cience told me, that I had been the wilful cau&s;e of the noble Clementina's calamity!</P>
<P>After I had a little recovered, I read to my&s;elf the next paragraph, which related, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the cruel Lau|rana dragged the &s;weet &s;ufferer by her gown, from her hiding place, inveighing again&s;t her, threatning her: She, all patient, re&s;igned, her hands cro&s;&s;ed on her bo&s;om, praying for mercy, not by &s;peech, but by her eyes, which however wept not: And cau&s;ing her to be carried up to her chamber, there puni&s;hed her with the Strait Wai&s;tcoat as &s;he had threatned</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Father Mare&s;cotti was greatly affected with Lau|ra's relation, as well as with what he had him&s;elf ob&s;erved: But on his return to Bologna, dreading to acquaint her Mother, for her own &s;ake, with the treatment her Clementina met with, he only &s;aid, he did not quite approve of it, and advi&s;ed her not to oppo&s;e the young Lady's being brought home, if the Bi&s;hop and the General came into it: But he laid the whole matter before the Bi&s;hop, who wrote to the General to join with him out of hand, to re|lea&s;e their &s;i&s;ter from her pre&s;ent bondage: And the General meeting the Bi&s;hop on a &s;et day at Milan, for that purpo&s;e, the Lady was accordingly relea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A breach en&s;ued upon it, with Lady Sforza and her daughter; who would have it, that Clementina was much better for their management. They had by terror broke her &s;pirit, and her pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s was reckoned upon as an indication of amendment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Marchione&s;s being much indi&s;po&s;ed, the young Lady attended by her Camilla, was carried to Naples; where it is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he now is. Poor young Lady, how has &s;he been hurried about!&mdash;
<PB N="59" REF="60">
But who can think of her cou&s;in Laurana without extreme indignation?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mrs. Beaumont writes, that the Bi&s;hop would fain have prevailed upon his brother, the General, to join with him in an invitation to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on to come over, as a la&s;t expedient, before they locked her up either in a Nunnery, or in &s;ome private hou&s;e: but the General would by no means come into it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He a&s;ked, What was propo&s;ed to be the end of Sir Charles's vi&s;it, were all that was wi&s;hed from it to follow, in his &s;i&s;ters re&s;tored mind?&mdash;He never, he &s;aid, would give his con&s;ent that &s;he &s;hould be the wife of an Engli&s;h prote&s;tant.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Bi&s;hop declared, that he was far from wi&s;h|ing her to be &s;o: But he was for leaving that to after-con&s;ideration. Could they but re&s;tore his &s;i&s;ter to her rea&s;on, that rea&s;on, co-operating with her principles, might an&s;wer all their hopes.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He might <HI>try</HI> his expedient, the General &s;aid, with all his heart: But he looked upon the Chevalier Grandi&s;on to be a man of art; and he was &s;ure he mu&s;t have entangled his &s;i&s;ter by methods impercep|tible to her, and to them; but yet more efficacious to his ends, than an open declaration. Had he not, he a&s;ked, found means to fa&s;cinate Olivia and as many women as he came into company with?&mdash;For his part, he loved not the Chevalier. He had <HI>forced</HI> him by his intrepidity to be civil to him: But forced civility was but a temporary one. It was his way to judge of cau&s;es by the effects: And this he knew, that he had lo&s;t a &s;i&s;ter who would have been a jewel in the Crown of a prince: And would not be an&s;wer|able for con&s;equences, if he and Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on were once more to meet, be it where it would.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Father Mare&s;cotti, however, joining, as the Bi&s;hop writes, with him, and the Marchione&s;s, in a de&s;ire to try this expedient; and being &s;ure that the Mar|quis

quis and Signor Jeronymo would not be aver&s;e to it, he took a re&s;olution to write over to him, as has been related.'</Q></P>
<P>This, Lucy, is the &s;tate of the unhappy ca&s;e, as briefly and as clearly as my memory will &s;erve to give it. And what a <HI>rememberer,</HI> if I may make a word, is the heart!&mdash;Not a circum&s;tance e&s;capes it.</P>
<P>And now it remained for me to know of Sir Charles what an&s;wer he had returned.</P>
<P>Was not my &s;ituation critical, my dear? Had Sir Charles a&s;ked my opinion, <HI>before</HI> he had taken his re&s;olutions, I &s;hould have given it with my whole heart, that he &s;hould fly to the comfort of the poor Lady. But then he would have &s;hewn a &s;u&s;pen&s;e unworthy of Clementina; and a compliment to me, which a good man &s;o circum&s;tanced ought not to make.</P>
<P>My regard for him (yet what a poor affected word is <HI>regard!)</HI> was neverthele&s;s as &s;trong as ever. Ge|nero&s;ity, or rather ju&s;tice, to Clementina, and that &s;o often avowed regard to him, pulled my heart two ways.&mdash;I wanted to con&s;ider with my&s;elf for a few moments: I was de&s;irous to clear the conduct that I was to &s;hew on this trying occa&s;ion, as well of preci|pitance as of affectation; and my cou&s;in Reeves ju&s;t then coming in for &s;omething &s;he wanted, I took the opportunity, while he made a compliment to her, to &s;ay, as to both, I will return immediately: And with|drew.</P>
<P>I went up to my own apartment. I traver&s;ed my antechamber, three or four times: Harriet Byron, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, be not mean. Ha&s;t thou not the ex|ample of a Clementina before thee? Her religion and her love, combating together, have overturned the no|ble creature's rea&s;on. Thou can&s;t not be called to &s;uch a tryal: But can&s;t thou not &s;hew, that if thou <HI>wert,</HI> thou could&s;t have acted greatly, if not <HI>&s;o</HI> great|ly?&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is ju&s;t: He <HI>ought</HI> to prefer

to thee the excellent Clementina. Priority of claim, compa&s;&s;ion for the noble &s;ufferer, merits <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;uperior!&mdash;I love him for <HI>his</HI> merits: Shall I not love merits nearly as great in one of my own &s;ex? The &s;truggle will co&s;t thee &s;omething: But go down, and try to be above thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>Down I went, not di&s;plea&s;ed with my&s;elf for have|ing been able to re&s;olve upon &s;uch an effort. Bani&s;h'd to thy retirement, to thy pillow, thought I, be all the <HI>girl.</HI> Often have I contended for the dignity of my &s;ex; let me now be an example to my&s;elf, and not unworthy in my own eyes (when I come to reflect) of an union, could it have been effected, with a man whom a Clementina looked up to with hope.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in withdrew when I came in: Sir Charles met me at the door: I hope he &s;aw dignity in my a&s;pect, without pride.</P>
<P>I &s;poke, while &s;pirit was high in me, and to keep my&s;elf up to it.&mdash;My heart bleeds, Sir, for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of your Clementina [Yes, Lucy, I &s;aid <HI>your</HI> Clementina]. I could not but withdraw for a few mo|ments to contemplate her great behaviour: and I mo&s;t &s;incerely lament her di&s;tre&s;&s;es. What, that is in the power of man, cannot Sir Charles Grandi&s;on do? You have honoured me, Sir, with the title of <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI> In the tenderne&s;s of that relation, permit me to &s;ay, that I dread the effects of the General's petulance: I feel next for you the pain that it mu&s;t give to your humane heart to be once more per&s;onally pre&s;ent to the woes of the inimitable Clementina: But I am &s;ure you did not he&s;itate a moment about leaving all your friends here in England, and re&s;olving to ha&s;ten over to <HI>try,</HI> at lea&s;t, what can be done for the noble &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Had he prai&s;ed me highly for this my addre&s;s to him, it would have looked. &s;uch was the &s;ituation on both &s;ides, as if he had thought this di&s;intere&s;ted behaviour in me, an extraordinary piece of magnanimity, and
<PB N="62" REF="63">
&s;elf-denial; and, of con&s;equence, as if he had &s;uppo&s;ed I had views upon him, which he wonder'd I could give up. His is the mo&s;t delicate of human minds.</P>
<P>He led me to my &s;eat, and taking his by me, &s;till holding my pa&s;&s;ive hand&mdash;Ever &s;ince I have had the honour of Mi&s;s Byron's acquaintance, I have con|&s;idered her as one of the mo&s;t excellent of women. My heart demands alliance with hers; and hopes to be allowed its claim, tho' &s;uch are the delicacies of &s;ituation, that I &s;carcely dare to tru&s;t my&s;elf to &s;peak upon the &s;ubject. From the fir&s;t, I called Mi&s;s By|ron my &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he is <HI>more</HI> to me than the deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter; and there is a more tender friend&s;hip that I a&s;pire to hold with her, whatever may be the accidents, on either &s;ide, to bar a farther wi&s;h: And this I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> hope, that &s;he will not deny me, &s;o long as it &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with her other attachments.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, I made an effort to &s;peak: But &s;peech was denied me. My face, as I felt, glowed like the fire before me.</P>
<P>My heart, re&s;umed he, is ever on my lips. It is tortured when I cannot &s;peak all that is in it. Profe&s;|&s;ions I am not accu&s;tomed to make. As I am not con|&s;cious of being unworthy of your friend&s;hip, I will <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> it; and farther talk to you of my affairs and engagements, as that tender friend&s;hip may warrant.</P>
<P>Sir, you do me honour, was all I could &s;ay.</P>
<P>I had a letter from the faithful Camilla. I hold not a corre&s;pondence with her: But the treatment that her young Lady met with, of which &s;he had got &s;ome ge|neral intimations, and &s;ome words that the Bi&s;hop &s;aid to her, which expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;hes, that I would make them one more vi&s;it at Bologna, urged her to write, begging of me, for Heaven's &s;ake, to go over. But unle&s;s one of the family had written to me, and by con&s;ent of others of it, what hope had I of a wel|come, after I had been as often refu&s;ed, as I had re|que&s;ted while I was in Italy, to be admitted to the

pre&s;ence of the Lady, who was &s;o de&s;irous of one in|terview more?&mdash;E&s;pecially, as Mrs. Beaumont gave me no encouragement to go, but the contrary, from what &s;he ob&s;erved of the inclinations of the family.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont is &s;till of opinion, as in the con|clu&s;ion of the Letter before you, that I &s;hould not go, unle&s;s the General and the Marquis join their reque&s;ts to tho&s;e of the Marchione&s;s, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti. But I had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed the Bi&s;hop's Letter than I wrote, that I would mo&s;t chearfully comply with his wi&s;hes: But that I &s;hould be glad that I might not be under any obligation to go farther than Bologna; where I might have the happine&s;s to attend my Jeronymo, as well as well as his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I had a little twitch at my heart, Lucy. I was &s;orry for it: But my judgment was entirely with him.</P>
<P>And now, madam, you will wonder, that you &s;ee not any preparations for my departure. All <HI>is</HI> pre|pared: I only wait for the company of one gentleman, who is &s;ettling his affairs with all expedition to go with me. He is an able, a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, who has had great practice abroad, and in the armies: And having acquired an ca&s;y fortune, is come to &s;ettle in his na|tive country. My Jeronymo expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with his &s;urgeons. If Mr. <HI>Lowther</HI> can be of &s;er|vice to him, how happy &s;hall I think my&s;elf! And if my pre&s;ence can be a means to re&s;tore the noble Clementina&mdash;But how dare I hope it?&mdash;And yet I am per&s;uaded, that in her ca&s;e, and with &s;uch a temper of mind (unu&s;ed to hard&s;hip and oppo&s;ition as &s;he had been) the only way to recover her, would have been by complying with her in every-thing that her heart or head was earne&s;tly &s;et upon: For what controul was nece&s;&s;ary to a young Lady, who never, even in the height of her malady, uttered a wi&s;h or thought that was contrary to her duty either to God, or her pa|rents; nor yet to the honour of her name, and, allow me, madam, to &s;ay, the <HI>pride</HI> of her &s;ex?</P>

I am under an obligation to go to Paris, proceeded he, from the will of my late friend Mr. Danby. I &s;hall &s;top there for a day or two only, in order to put things in a way for my la&s;t hand, on my return from Italy.</P>
<P>When I am in Italy, I &s;hall perhaps be enabled to adju&s;t two or three accounts that &s;tand out, in relati|on to the affairs of my Ward.</P>
<P>This day at dinner I &s;hall &s;ee Mrs Oldham, and her &s;ons; and in the afternoon, at tea, Mrs. O-Hara and her Hu&s;band, and Captain Salmonet.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, at the time, do what I could, I found a tear ready to &s;tart. My heart was very untoward, Lucy; and I was guilty of a little female turn. When I found the twinkling of my eyes would not di&s;per&s;e the too ready drop, and felt it &s;tealing down my cheek, I wiped it off&mdash;The poor Emily, &s;aid I&mdash;She will be grieved at parting with you.

<P>I was glad to carry my thoughts out of my&s;elf, as I may &s;ay, and from my own concerns. We all, Sir, &s;aid I, look upon Mr. Beauchamp as a future&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;band for Emily, madam, interrupted he?&mdash;It mu&s;t not be at <HI>my</HI> motion. My friend &s;hall be in|titled to &s;hare with me my whole e&s;tate; but I will never &s;eck to lead the choice of my WARD. Let Emily, &s;ome time hence, find out the hu&s;band &s;he

And the more &s;o, as I hope &s;he her&s;elf wants not delicacy. There is a cruelty in per&s;wa&s;ion, where the heart rejects the per&s;on propo&s;ed, whether the urger be parent or guardian.</P>

<P>Do you expect Mr. Beauchamp &s;oon, Sir?</P>
<P>Every day, madam.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir, that you can bring all the&s;e things to bear before you leave England, and go &s;o &s;oon?</P>
<P>I fear nothing but Charlotte's whim&s;ies: Have you, madam, any rea&s;on to apprehend that &s;he is aver&s;e to an alliance with Lord G.? His father and aunt are very importunate for an early celebration.</P>

<P>I had kept up my &s;pirits to their utmo&s;t &s;tretch, I be&s;ought my cou&s;ins to excu&s;e me for a few minutes.

<P>MISS Grandi&s;on came to me ju&s;t as we had &s;upped. She longed, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ee me; but was prevented coming before, and de&s;ired to know what had pa&s;&s;ed between her brother and me this morning. I gave her the Letter, which I had but a little while before concluded. He had owned, &s;he &s;aid, that he had breakfa&s;ted with me, and &s;poke of me to her and Lord and Lady L. with an ardor, that gave them plea&s;ure. She put my Letter into her bo|&s;om. I may, I hope, Harriet&mdash;if you plea&s;e, madam, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><HI>If you plea&s;e, madam,</HI> repeated &s;he; and with that <HI>do-lo-rous</HI> accent too, my Hariet!&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter and I have been in tears this Morning: Lord L. had much ado to forbear. Sir Charles will &s;oon leave us.</P>
<P>It can't be helped, Charlotte. Did you dine to day in St. James's Square.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
No, indeed!&mdash;My brother had a certain tribe with him; and the woman al&s;o. It is very difficult, I be|lieve, Harriet, for good people to forbear doing &s;ome|times <HI>more</HI> than goodne&s;s requires of them.</P>
<P>Could you not, Charlotte, have &s;at at table with them for one hour or two?</P>
<P>My brother did not a&s;k me. He did not expect it. He gives every-body their choice, you know. He told me la&s;t night who were to dine with him to-day, and &s;uppo&s;ed I would choo&s;e to dine with Lady L. or with <HI>you,</HI> he was &s;o free as to &s;ay.</P>
<P>He did us an honour, which you thought too great a one. But if he <HI>had</HI> a&s;ked you, Charlotte&mdash;</P>
<P>Then I &s;hould have bridled. Indeed, I a&s;ked him, If he did not over-do it.</P>
<P>What was his an&s;wer?</P>
<P>Perhaps he might.&mdash;But I, &s;aid he, may never &s;ee Mrs. Oldham again. I want to inform my&s;elf of her future intentions, with a view (over-do it again, Char|lotte!) to make her ea&s;y and happy for life. Her chil|dren are in the world. I want to give her a credit that will make her remembred by them, as they grow up, with duty. I hope I am &s;uperior to forms. She is con|&s;cious. I can pity her. She is a gentlewoman; and intitled to a place at any man's table to whom &s;he ne|ver was a &s;ervant. She never was mine.</P>
<P>And what, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, could you &s;ay in an|&s;wer? a&s;ked I.</P>
<P>What!&mdash;Why I put up my lip.</P>
<P>Ungracious girl!</P>
<P>I can't help it. That may become a man to do in &s;uch ca&s;es as this, that would not a woman.</P>
<P>Sir Charles wants not <HI>delicacy,</HI> my dear, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that I &s;hould have &s;at &s;welling, and been re&s;erved: He was right not to a&s;k me&mdash;So be quiet, Harriet&mdash;And yet perhaps, you would be as tame to a hu&s;band's mi&s;tre&s;s, as you &s;eem favourable to a father's.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
She then put on one of her arch looks&mdash;</P>
<P>The ca&s;es differ, Charlotte&mdash;But do you know what pa&s;&s;ed between the generous man, and the mor|tified woman and her children; mortified as they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be by his goodne&s;s?</P>
<P>Yes, yes; I had curio&s;ity enough to a&s;k Dr. Bart|lett about it all.</P>
<P>Pray, Charlotte&mdash;</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett is favourable to every-body, &s;inners as well as &s;aints&mdash;He began with prai&s;ing the mode&s;ty of her dre&s;s, the humility of her behaviour: He &s;aid, that &s;he trembled and looked down, till &s;he was re|a&s;&s;ured by Sir Charles. Such creatures have all their tricks, Harriet.</P>
<P>You, Charlotte, are not favourable to &s;inners, and hardly to &s;aints. But pray proceed.</P>
<P>Why, he re-a&s;&s;ured the woman, as I told you. And then proceeded to ask many que&s;tions of the elder Oldham&mdash;I pitied that young fellow&mdash;to have a mo|ther in his eye, who&s;e very tenderne&s;s to the young ones kept alive the &s;en&s;e of her guilt. And yet what would &s;he have been, had &s;he not been doubly tender to the innocents, who were born to &s;hame from her fault? The young man acknowleged a military ge|nius, and Sir Charles told him, that he would, on his return from a journey he was going to take, con&s;ider whether he could not do him &s;ervice in the way he cho&s;e. He gave him, it &s;eems, a brief lecture on what he &s;hould aim to be, and what avoid, to qualify him&s;elf for a man of true honour; and &s;poke very hand&s;omely of &s;uch gentlemen of the army as are real gentlemen. The young fellow, continued Mi&s;s Grand|di&s;on, may look upon him&s;elf to be as good as pro|vided for, &s;ince my brother never gives the mo&s;t di|&s;tant hope that is not followed by ab&s;olute certainty, the fir&s;t opportunity, not that <HI>offers,</HI> but which he can <HI>make.</HI></P>
<P>He took great notice of the little boys. He dilated

their hearts, and &s;et them a prating; and was plea&s;ed with their prate. The doctor, who had never &s;een him before in the company of children, applauded him for his vivacity and conde&s;cending talk to them. The tendere&s;t father in the world, he &s;aid, could not have behaved more tenderly, or &s;hewed him&s;elf more de|lighted with his own children, than he did with tho&s;e brats of Mrs. Oldham.</P>
<P>Ah, Charlotte! And is it out of doubt, that you are the Daughter of Lady Grandi&s;on, and &s;i&s;ter of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?&mdash;Well, but I believe you are&mdash;Some children take after the father, &s;ome after the mother!&mdash;Forgive me, my dear.</P>
<P>But I won't. I have a great mind to quarrel with you, Harriet.</P>
<P>Pray don't; becau&s;e I could neither help, nor can be &s;orry for, what I &s;aid. But pray proceed.</P>
<P>Why he made pre&s;ents to the children. I don't know what they were; nor could the doctor tell me. I &s;uppo&s;e very hand&s;ome ones; for he has the &s;pirit of a prince. He enquired very particularly after the circum&s;tances of the mother; and was more kind to her than many people would be to their own mothers.&mdash;<HI>He</HI> can account for this, I &s;uppo&s;e,&mdash;tho' <HI>I</HI> cannot. The woman, it is true, is of a good family, and &s;o forth: But that enhances her crime. Natural chil|dren abound in the pre&s;ent age. Keeping is fa&s;hionable. Good men &s;hould not countenance &s;uch wretches.&mdash;But my brother and you are charitable creatures!&mdash;With all my heart, child. Virtue, however, has at lea&s;t as much to &s;ay on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion as on the other.</P>
<P>When the poor children are in the world, as your brother &s;aid&mdash;When the poor women are penitents, <HI>true</HI> penitents&mdash;Your brother's treatment of Mrs. Gif|fard was different. He is in both in&s;tances an imitator of the Almighty; an humbler of the impenitent, and an encourager of tho&s;e who repent.</P>

Well, well; He is undoubtedly a good &s;ort of young man; and, Harriet, you are a good &s;ort of young wo|man.

<P>MISS Jervois came to me this morning by &s;ix; impatient, as &s;he &s;aid, to communicate good news to me. I was in my clo&s;et writing. I could not &s;leep.</P>
<P>I have &s;een my mother, &s;aid &s;he; and we are good friends. Was &s;he ever unkind to me, madam?</P>
<P>Dear creature! &s;aid I, and cla&s;ped her to my bo|&s;om, you are a &s;weet girl! Oblige me with the parti|culars.</P>
<P>Let me, Lucy, give you, as near as I can recollect the amiable young creature's words and actions on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sit down, my love, &s;aid I.&mdash;What! When I am talking of a reconciled mother! And to dear Mi&s;s Byron!&mdash;No, indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
She often held out one open hand, while the fore|finger of the other, in full action, patted it; as at other times both were &s;pread, with pretty wonder and de|light: and thus &s;he began:</P>
<P>Why, you mu&s;t know, it was about &s;ix o'clock ye|&s;terday afternoon, that my mother and her hu&s;band, and Captain Salmonet, came. I was told of their vi&s;it, but two hours before: And when the coach &s;topped, and I at the window &s;aw them alight, I thought I &s;hould have fainted away. I would have given half I was worth in the world to have been an hundred miles off.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett was there, and received them. My guardian was unexpectedly engaged in an&s;wering a Letter &s;ent him by Lord W. for which a gentleman waited: But they had not been there a quarter of an hour, when he entered, and made apologie, to them in his u&s;ual gracious manner. Never, the Doctor &s;ays, did any body look &s;o re&s;pectful as the Major and the Captain; and they would have made apologies to my guardian for their la&s;t behaviour to him; but he would not let them. And my mother, the doctor &s;ays, from the very fir&s;t behaved prettily.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he a&s;ked for me, my guardian him|&s;elf conde&s;cended to come up to me, and took my hand&mdash;Was not that very good of him?&mdash;My dear &s;aid he, as he led me down &s;tairs (and &s;poke <HI>&s;o</HI> kindly) don't tremble &s;o: Am I not with you?&mdash;Your mo|ther is very calm and compo&s;ed: You mu&s;t a&s;k her ble&s;&s;ing. I &s;hall ea&s;e your tender heart of every pang. I &s;hall hint to you what to do, and how to behave to the gentlemen as occa&s;ions ari&s;e.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner &s;aid the words, but the drawing|room-door gave way to his hand, and I was in the room with him.</P>
<P>Down on my knees dropt I&mdash;as I now do to you: But I could not &s;peak. Thus I did [and &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and bowed her face upon it]. And my mo|ther rai&s;ed me&mdash;<HI>You</HI> mu&s;t rai&s;e me, madam&mdash;Yes,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
ju&s;t &s;o&mdash;And &s;he ki&s;&s;ed me <HI>too,</HI> and wept on my neck; and called me pretty names; and encouraged me, and &s;aid &s;he loved me, as &s;he loved her own &s;oul&mdash;And I <HI>was</HI> encouraged.</P>
<P>My guardian then, with the air and manner of a gracious prince, took my hand, and pre&s;ented it fir&s;t to the Major, then to the Captain: and they each ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and &s;poke in my prai&s;e, I can't tell how many fine things.</P>
<P>Major, &s;aid my guardian, when he pre&s;ented me to him, you mu&s;t excu&s;e the dear child's weakne&s;s of &s;pirits: &s;he wi&s;hes you all happine&s;s on your nuptials: She has let me know, that &s;he is very de&s;irous to do you &s;ervice for her mother's &s;ake.</P>
<P>The Major &s;wore by his Soul I was an angel!&mdash;Captain Salmonet &s;aid, that by his Salvation, I was a charming young Lady!</P>
<P>My Mother wept&mdash;O Sir! &s;aid &s;he to my guardian: And dropping down in a chair by the window, not a word more could &s;he &s;peak.</P>
<P>I ran to her, and cla&s;ped my arms about her. She wept the more: I wiped her eyes with her own hand|kerchief: I told her, it went to my heart to &s;ee her cry: I begged &s;he would &s;pare me <HI>this</HI> grief.</P>
<P>She cla&s;ped her arms then about me, and ki&s;&s;ed my cheek, and my forehead. O thought I, it is very good of you, my dear mother.</P>
<P>Then came my guardian to us, and he kindly took my mother's hand, and conducted her to the fire-&s;ide; and he led me, and placed me by her, at the tea-ta|ble; and he made the Major and the Captain &s;it down by him: So much graciou&s;ne&s;s in his countenance. O madam, I &s;hall be an Idolater, I am afraid. And he &s;aid, Emily, my dear, you will make tea for us. My &s;i&s;ter dined abroad, madam, to my Mother.&mdash;Yes, Sir, I will, &s;aid I: And I was as lively as a bird.</P>
<P>But before the &s;ervants came in, Let me tell you, madam, &s;aid he, what Mi&s;s Jervois has propo&s;ed to me.&mdash;They were in &s;ilent expectation.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">
She has de&s;ired that you, Major, will accept from her, for your mutual ea&s;e, of an additional 100<HI>l.</HI> a year; which I &s;hall order to be paid you quarterly, during Mrs. O-Hara's life, not doubting but you will make her as happy as it is in your power to make her.</P>
<P>My mother bowed, coloured with gratitude, and looked obliged.</P>
<P>And &s;he begs of you, madam, turning to my mo|ther, that you will accept as from the <HI>Major,</HI> an|other 100<HI>l.</HI> a year, for pin-money, which he, or which <HI>you,</HI> madam, will draw upon me for; al&s;o quar|terly, if you choo&s;e not to <HI>trouble him</HI> to do it: For this 100<HI>l.</HI> a year mu&s;t be appropriated to your &s;ole and &s;eparate u&s;e, madam; and not be &s;ubject to your controul, Major O-Hara.</P>
<P>Good God! Sir! &s;aid the Major!&mdash;What a wretch was I, the la&s;t time I was here!&mdash;There is no bearing of this!</P>
<P>He got up, and went to the window: And the Captain &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;u! and &s;omething el&s;e, which I could not mind; for I was weeping like a baby.</P>
<P>What, Sir, &s;aid my mother, 400<HI>l.</HI> a year! Do you mean &s;o?&mdash;I do, madam&mdash;And, Sir, to be &s;o generou&s;ly paid me my 100<HI>l.</HI> of it, as if I received it not from my child, but from my hu&s;band!&mdash;Good God! How you overpower me, Sir! What &s;hame, what remor&s;e, do you &s;trike into my heart!</P>
<P>And my poor mother's tears ran down as fa&s;t as mine.</P>
<P>O madam, &s;aid the dear girl to me, cla&s;ping her arms about me, how your tender heart is touched!&mdash;It is well you were not there!</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett came in to tea. My guardian would not permit Antony, who offered him&s;elf, to wait. Antony had been my own papa's &s;ervant, when my mother was not &s;o good.</P>
<P>Nothing but ble&s;&s;ings, nothing but looks and words of admiration and gratitude, pa&s;&s;ed all the tea-time.
<PB N="76" REF="77">
How their hearts rejoiced I warrant!&mdash;Is it not a charming thing, madam, to make people's hearts glad?&mdash;To be &s;ure it is! How many hearts has my guardian rejoiced! You mu&s;t bid him be cro&s;s to me, or I &s;hall not know what to do with my&s;elf!&mdash;But then, if he was, I &s;hould only get by my&s;elf, and cry, and be angry with my&s;elf, and think <HI>he</HI> could not be to blame.</P>
<P>O my love, my Emily! &s;aid I, take care of your gratitude: That drew in your true Friend.</P>
<P>Well, but how can it be helped, madam? Can a right heart be ungrateful? Dr. Bartlett &s;ays, There is no &s;uch thing as true happine&s;s in this life: And is it not better to be unhappy from good men and women, than from bad?&mdash;Dear madam, why <HI>you</HI> have often made me unhappy, becau&s;e of your goodne&s;s to me; and becau&s;e I knew, that I neither could de&s;erve nor return it.</P>
<P>The dear prater went on&mdash;My guardian called me a&s;ide, when tea was over. My Emily, &s;aid he&mdash;[I do love he &s;hould call me <HI>his</HI> Emily!&mdash;But all the world is <HI>his</HI> Emily, I think] Let me &s;ee what you will do with the&s;e two notes; giving me two Bank-notes of 25<HI>l.</HI> each.&mdash;Pre&s;ent pin-money and ca&s;h may be wanted. We will &s;uppo&s;e that your mother has been married a quarter of a year. Her pin-money and the additional annuity may commence from the 25th of December la&s;t. Let me, Emily, when they go away, &s;ee the graceful mannner in which you will di&s;po&s;e of the notes: And from Mr. O-Hara's behaviour upon it, we &s;hall ob&s;erve whether he is a man with whom your mother, if it be not her own fault (now you have made it their intere&s;t to be kind to each other) may live well: But the motion be all your own.</P>
<P>How <HI>good</HI> this was! I could have ki&s;&s;ed the hand that gave me the notes, if I thought it would not have looked too free.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Sir, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
And when they went away, pouring out their very hearts in grateful joy, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr. O-Hara; Sir, &s;aid I, it is proper that the payment of the additional annuity &s;hould have a commencement. Let it be from Chri&s;tmas la&s;t. Accept of the fir&s;t payment from my own hands&mdash;And I gave him one 25<HI>l.</HI> note: And looking at my mother, with a look of duty, for fear <HI>he</HI> &s;hould mi&s;take, and di&s;credit him|&s;elf in the eyes of the deepe&s;t di&s;cerner in the world, gave him the other.</P>
<P>He looked upon fir&s;t one then upon the other note with &s;urprize&mdash;And then bowing to the ground to me, and to my guardian, he &s;tept to my mother, and pre&s;ented them both to her. You, madam, &s;aid he, mu&s;t <HI>&s;peak:</HI> I cannot as I ought: God &s;end me with a whole heart out of this hou&s;e! He hurried out, and when he was in the hall, wiped his eyes, and &s;obbed like a child, as one of the &s;ervants told my Anne.</P>
<P>My mother looked upon one note as her hu&s;band had done, and upon the other; and, lifting up her eyes, embraced me&mdash;And would have &s;aid &s;omething to my guardian, but he prevented her by &s;aying&mdash;Emily will be always dutiful to you, madam, and re|&s;pectful to Mr. O-Hara: May you be happy together!</P>
<P>And he led her out&mdash;Was ever &s;uch a conde&s;cen|&s;ion! He led her out to her hu&s;band, who, being a little recovered, was ju&s;t about to give &s;ome money to the &s;ervant, who was retiring from the offer&mdash;No|body, &s;aid my guardian, graciou&s;ly &s;miling, pays my &s;ervants but my&s;elf, Mr. O-Hara. They are good people, and <HI>merit</HI> my favour.</P>
<P>And he went to the very door with my mother. I could not. I ran back, crying for joy, into the draw|ing-room; when <HI>they</HI> went out of it. I could not bear my&s;elf. How could I, you know, madam?&mdash;Captain Salmonet all the time wiped his eyes, &s;hrugged his &s;houlders, lifted up his hands, and cried out upon Je&s;u; and once or twice he cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: But all

the time my guardian looked and acted, as if tho&s;e actions and prai&s;es were nothing to be proud of.</P>
<P>When he came in to me, I aro&s;e, and threw my|&s;elf at his feet; but could only &s;ay, Thank you, Sir, for your goodne&s;s to my mother. He rai&s;ed me. He &s;at down by me: See, child (&s;aid he, and he took my hand: My heart was &s;en&s;ible of the favour, and throbbed with joy) what it is in the power of people of fortune to do. You have a great one. Now your mother is married, I have hopes of her. They will at lea&s;t keep up appearances to each other, and to the world. They neither of them want &s;en&s;e. <HI>You</HI> have done an act of duty and benevolence both in one. The man who would grudge them this additional 200<HI>l.</HI> a year out of your fortune, to make your parent hap|py, &s;hall not have my Emily&mdash;Shall he?</P>
<P>Your Emily, your <HI>happy</HI> Emily, Sir, has not, can|not have a heart that is worth notice, if it be not im|plicitly guided by you.&mdash;This I &s;aid, madam; and it is true.</P>
<P>And did he, not &s;aid I, cla&s;p his Emily to his gene|rous bo&s;om, when you &s;aid &s;o?</P>
<P>No, madam; that would have been too great an honour: But he called me, Good child! And &s;aid, you &s;hall never be put to pay me an <HI>implicit</HI> regard: Your own rea&s;on (and he called me <HI>child</HI> again) &s;hall always be the judge of my conduct to you, and direct your ob&s;ervances of my advice. Something like this he &s;aid; but in a better manner than I can &s;ay it.</P>
<P>He calls me oftner <HI>child,</HI> madam, than any-thing el&s;e when we are alone together; and is not quite &s;o free, I think, at &s;uch times, in his behaviour to me (yet is <HI>va&s;tly</HI> gracious I don't know how) as when we are in company&mdash;Why is that? I am &s;ure, I equally re&s;pect <HI>him,</HI> at one time as at another&mdash;Do you think, madam, there is any-thing in the ob&s;ervation?

<P>MISS Grandi&s;on, as I told you, took with her my Letter of ye&s;terday. As &s;oon as my cou&s;in Reeves and I entered Sir Charles's hou&s;e, the two &s;i&s;ters conducted us into the drawing-room adjoining to the dining-parlour, and congratulated me on the high compliment their brother had made me, tho' in preference to them&s;elves, and his communicativene&s;s and tender behaviour to me. Lord L. joined us, and he, having read the Letter, congratulated me al&s;o&mdash;On what, Lucy?&mdash;Why on the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> that if the unhappy Clementina &s;hould die; or if &s;he &s;hould be
<PB N="80" REF="81">
buried for life in a nunnery; or if &s;he &s;hould be other|wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of; why then, that your Harriet may have room given her to hope for a <HI>civil</HI> hu&s;band in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and <HI>half</HI> a heart; Is not this the &s;um of the&s;e humbling congratulations?</P>
<P>Sir Charles, when we came, was in his Study with Mr. Lowther, the &s;urgeon whom he had engaged to go abroad with him: But he ju&s;t came out to welcome us; and then returned.&mdash;He had al&s;o with him two phy&s;icians eminent for their knowlege in di&s;orders of the head, to whom he had before com|municated the ca&s;e of the unhappy Clementina; and who brought to him in writing their opinions of the manner in which &s;he ought to be treated, according to the various &s;ymptoms of her di&s;order.</P>
<P>When he joined us, he told us this; and &s;aid very high things at the &s;ame time in prai&s;e of the Engli&s;h &s;urgeons; and particularly of this gentleman: And added, that as nervous di&s;orders were more frequent in England, than in any country in the world, he was willing to hope, that the Engli&s;h phy&s;icians were more &s;kilful than tho&s;e of any other country in the ma|nagement of per&s;ons afflicted with &s;uch maladies: And as he was now invited over, he was determined to furni&s;h him&s;elf with all the means he could think of, that were likely to be u&s;eful in re&s;toring and heal|ing friends &s;o dear to him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on told him, that we were all in &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, on his going to Italy, of that fierce and wrong-headed man the General. Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid &s;he, has told us, that Mrs. Beaumont advi&s;es not your going over.</P>
<P>The young Marquis della Porretta, &s;aid he, is ha&s;ty; but he is a gallant man, and loves his &s;i&s;ter. His grief on the unhappy &s;ituation they are in demands allowance. It is natural in an heavy calamity to look out of our&s;elves for the occa&s;ion. I have not any ap|prehen&s;ions from him, or from any body el&s;e. The

call upon me is a proper one. The i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be left where it ought to be left.

<P>Lord L. a&s;ked Sir Charles, whether he had fixed the day of his &s;etting out?</P>
<P>I have, &s;aid he, within this half hour. Mr. Lowther has told me, that he &s;hould be ready by the beginning of next week; and on Saturday &s;even-night, I hope to be at Dover on my way.</P>
<P>We looked upon one another. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on told me afterwards, that my colour went and came &s;everal times, and that &s;he was afraid for me. My heart was <HI>indeed</HI> a little affected. I believe I mu&s;t not think of taking leave of him when he &s;ets out. Ah Lucy! Nine days hence!&mdash;Yet, in le&s;s than nine days after that, I &s;hall be embraced by the tendere&s;t relations that ever creature had to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Sir Charles taking his &s;i&s;ter a&s;ide, I want, &s;aid he, to &s;ay a few words to you, Charlotte. They were about half an hour together; and then returning, I am encouraged to think, &s;aid he, that Charlotte will give her hand to Lord G. She is a woman of honour, and her heart mu&s;t therefore go with it.&mdash;I have a re|que&s;t to make to her, before all you our common friends&mdash;The Earl of G. Lady Gertrude, Lord G. all join in one &s;uit: It is, that I may be allowed to give my &s;i&s;ter to Lord G. before I leave England.</P>
<P>I have told you, brother, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, if you go away in nine or ten days time.</P>
<P>Sir Charles particularly reque&s;ted my influence. I could have no doubt, I &s;aid, but Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on would oblige her brother.</P>
<P>She vehemently oppo&s;ed &s;o early a day.</P>
<P>In a mo&s;t affectionate manner, yet with an air of
<PB N="82" REF="83">
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, he urged his reque&s;t. He &s;aid, that it was very proper for him to make &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions of his af|fairs before he went abroad. He &s;hould leave Eng|land with much more plea&s;ure, if he &s;aw his Charlotte the wife of a man &s;o worthy as Lord G.: Lord G. &s;aid he, adores you: You <HI>intend</HI> to be his: Re&s;olve to oblige your brother, who, tho' he cannot be happy him&s;elf, wi&s;hes to &s;ee you &s;o.</P>
<P>O Sir Charles!&mdash;You ruin me by your &s;olemnity, and by your goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is not a light one. I am greatly in earne&s;t, Charlotte. I have many affairs on my hands. My heart is in this company; yet my engagements will permit me but few opportunities to enjoy it be|tween this and Tue&s;day next. If you deny me now, I mu&s;t acquie&s;ce If you have more than punctilio to plead, &s;ay you have; and I will not urge you farther.</P>
<P>And &s;o this is the la&s;t time of a&s;king, Sir? A little archly&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Not</HI> the la&s;t time of my Lord G.'s&mdash;But of mine&mdash;But I will not allow you now to an&s;wer me lightly.&mdash;If you can name a day before Tue&s;day, you will great|ly oblige me. I will leave you to con&s;ider of it. And he withdrew.</P>
<P>Every-one then urged her to oblige her brother. Lady L. very particularly. She told her, that he was <HI>intitled</HI> to her compliance; and that he had &s;poken to <HI>her</HI> on this &s;ubject in a &s;till more earne&s;t manner. She &s;hould hardly be able to excu&s;e her, &s;he &s;aid, if the &s;erious hint he had given about &s;ettling his affairs be|fore he went abroad, had not weight with her. You know, Charlotte, continued &s;he, that he can have no motive but your good; and you have told me, that you intend to have Lord G. and that you e&s;teem his father, his aunt, and every one of his family, whom you have &s;een; and they are highly plea&s;ed with you. Settlements are ready drawn: That my brother told you la&s;t night. Nothing is wanting but your day.</P>

I wi&s;h he was in half the hurry to be married him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>So he would be, I dare &s;ay, if marriage were as much in his power, as it is in yours.</P>
<P>What a duce, to be married to a man in a week's time, with whom I have quarrell'd every day for a fortnight pa&s;t&mdash;Pride and petulance mu&s;t go down by degrees, &s;i&s;ter. A month, at lea&s;t, is nece&s;&s;ary, to bring my features to &s;uch a placidne&s;s with him, as to allow him to &s;mile in my face.</P>
<P>Your brother has hinted, Charlotte, &s;aid I, that he loves you for your vivacity; and &s;hould &s;till more, if you con&s;ulted <HI>time</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>He has withdrawn, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid Lord L. with a re|&s;olution, if you deny him, to urge you no farther.</P>
<P>I <HI>hate</HI> his peremptorine&s;s.</P>
<P>Has he not told you, Charlotte, &s;aid I, and that in a manner &s;o &s;erious, as to affect every body, that there is a kind of nece&s;&s;ity for it?</P>
<P>I don't love this Clementina, Harriet: All this is owing to her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then a rapping at the door &s;ignified vi&s;itors; and Emily ran in&mdash;Lord G. the Earl and Lady Ger|trude, believe me!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on changed colour. A contrivance of my brother's!&mdash;Ah! Lord! Now &s;hall I be be&s;et!&mdash;I will be &s;ullen, that I may not be &s;aucy.</P>
<P><HI>Sullen</HI> you can't be, Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L.: Bnt <HI>&s;aucy</HI> you can. Remember, however, my Brother's earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;pare Lord G. before his father and aunt, or you will give me and every-body, pain.</P>
<P>How can I? Our la&s;t quarrel is not made up: But advi&s;e him not to be either impertinent or &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Immediately enter'd Sir Charles, introducing the Earl and Lady Gertrude. After the fir&s;t compliments, Pray, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, drawing him a&s;ide, towards me, and whi&s;pering, tell me truly: Did you not know of this vi&s;it?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">
I <HI>invited</HI> them, Charlotte, whi&s;pered he. I meant not however to &s;urpri&s;e you. If you comply, you will give me great plea&s;ure: If you do not, I will not be <HI>di&s;</HI>-plea&s;ed with my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>What <HI>can</HI> I do? Either be le&s;s good to me, Sir, or le&s;s hurrying.</P>
<P>You have &s;acrificed enough to female punctilio, Charlotte, Lord G. has been a zealous courtier. You have no doubt of the ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion, nor of your own power. Leave the day to me. Let it be Tue&s;day next.</P>
<P>Good heaven! I can't bear you, after &s;uch a&mdash;And &s;he ga&s;ped, as if for breath; and he turning from her to me, &s;he went to Lady Gertrude, who ri&s;ing, took her hand and withdrew with her into the next room.</P>
<P>They &s;taid out till they were told dinner was &s;erved: And when they returned, I thought I never &s;aw Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on look &s;o lovely. A charming flu&s;h had over&s;pread her cheeks: a &s;weet con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in her eyes gave a female grace to her whole a&s;pect, and &s;oftened, as I may &s;ay, the natural Maje&s;ty of her fine features.</P>
<P>Lord G. looked delighted, as if his heart were filled with happy pre&s;ages. The Earl &s;eemed no le&s;s plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on was unu&s;ually thoughtful all dinner|time: She gave me great joy to &s;ee her &s;o, in the hope, that when the lover becomes the hu&s;band, the over-lively mi&s;tre&s;s will be &s;unk in the obliging wife.&mdash;And yet, now and then, as the joy in my Lord's heart overflowed at his lips, I could ob&s;erve <HI>that</HI> archne&s;s ri&s;ing to her eye, that makes one both love and fear her.</P>
<P>After dinner the Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude, de&s;ired a conference with Sir Charles and Lady L. They were not long ab&s;ent, when Sir Charles came in, and carried out Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on to them. Lord G's complexion varied often.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
Sir Charles left them together, and joined us. We were &s;tanding; and he &s;ingled me out.&mdash;I hope, ma|dam, &s;aid he, that Charlotte may be prevailed upon for Tue&s;day next: But I will not urge it farther.</P>
<P>I thought that he was framing him&s;elf to &s;ay &s;ome|thing particular to me, when Lady L. came in, and de&s;ired him and me to &s;tep to her &s;i&s;ter, who had re|tired, from the Earl and Lady Gertrude, by con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Ah, my Harriet! &s;aid &s;he, pity me, my dear!&mdash;Deba&s;ement is the child of pride&mdash;Then turning to Sir Charles, I acknowlege my&s;elf overcome, &s;aid &s;he, by your earne&s;tne&s;s, as you are &s;o &s;oon to leave us; and by the importunities of the Earl of G. Lady Gertrude, and by Si&s;ter&mdash;Unprepared in mind, in cloaths, I am re&s;olved to oblige the be&s;t of brothers. Do you, Sir, di&s;po&s;e of me as you think fit.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter con&s;ents, Sir, &s;aid Lady L. for next Tue&s;|day.</P>
<P>Chearfully, I hope. If Charlotte balances whe|ther, if &s;he took more time, &s;he &s;hould have Lord G. at all, let her take it. Lord L. in my ab&s;ence, will be to her all that I wi&s;h to be, when &s;he &s;hall deter|mine.</P>
<P>I balance <HI>not,</HI> Sir: But I thought to have had a month's time, at lea&s;t, to look about me, and having treated Lord G. too &s;lippantly, to give him by degrees &s;ome fairer pro&s;pects of happine&s;s with me, than hi|therto he has had.</P>
<P>Sir Charles embraced her. She was all his Si&s;ter, he &s;aid. Let the alteration <HI>now</HI> begin. Lord G. would rejoice in it, and con&s;ider all that had pa&s;&s;ed, as trials only of his love for her. The obliging wife would bani&s;h from his remembrance the petulant mi&s;tre&s;s. And now, allow me, my dear &s;i&s;ter, to pre&s;ent you to the Earl and Lady Gertrude.</P>
<P>He led her in to them. Lady L. took my hand, and led me in al&s;o.&mdash;Charlotte, my Lord, yields to yours and Lady Gertrude's importunities. Next Tue&s;|day
<PB N="86" REF="87">
will give the two families a near and tender rela|tion to each other.</P>
<P>The Earl &s;aluted her in a very affectionate manner: So did Lady Gertrude; who afterwards run out for her nephew;&punc;and, leading him in, pre&s;ented him to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t time to whi&s;per me, as he approach'd her; Ah, Harriet! now comes the wor&s;t part of the &s;hew.&mdash;He kneeled on one knee, ki&s;&s;ed her hand; but was too much overjoyed to &s;peak; for Lady Ger|trude had told him, as &s;he led him in, that Tue&s;day was to be his happy day.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, Lucy, but Sir Charles Grandi&s;on mu&s;t carry every point he &s;ets his heart upon. When he &s;hall appear before the family of Porretta in Italy, <HI>who</HI> will be able to with&s;tand him?&mdash;Is not his con&s;e|quence doubled, <HI>more</HI> than doubled, &s;ince he was with them? The man who&s;e <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> they reque&s;ted, they now <HI>invite</HI> to come among them. They have tried every experiment to re&s;tore their Clementina: He has a noble e&s;tate now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The fame of his goodne&s;s is gone out to di&s;tant countries. O my dear! All oppo&s;ition mu&s;t fly before him. And if it be the will of heaven to re&s;tore Clementina, all her friends mu&s;t concur in giving her to him upon the terms he has propo&s;ed; and from which having <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> propo&s;ed them, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on cannot re|cede.</P>
<P>His heart, it is evident, is at Bologna. Well, and &s;o it ought to be. And yet I could not forbear being &s;en&s;ibly touched by the following words, which I over|heard him &s;ay to Lord L. in an&s;wer to &s;omething my Lord &s;aid to him:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I am impatient to be abroad. Had I not waited for Mr. Lowther, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t Letters I received from Italy &s;hould have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in per&s;on'</Q></P>
<P>But as honour, compa&s;ion, love, friend&s;hip (&s;till nobler than love!) have demands upon him, let him
<PB N="87" REF="88">
obey the call. He has &s;et me high in his e&s;teem. Let me be worthy of his friend&s;hip. Pangs I &s;hall oc|ca&s;ionally feel; but who that values one per&s;on above the re&s;t of the world, does not?</P>
<P>Sir Charles, as we &s;at at tea, mentioned his cou&s;in Grandi&s;on to Lord L.: It is &s;trange, my Lord, &s;aid he, that we hear nothing of our cou&s;in Everard, &s;ince he was &s;een at White's. But whenever he <HI>emerges,</HI> Charlotte, if I am ab&s;ent, receive him without re|proaches: Yet I &s;hould be glad that he could have rejoiced with us. Mu&s;t I leave England, and not &s;ee him?</P>
<P>It has been, it &s;eems, the way of this unhappy man, to &s;hut him&s;elf up with &s;ome woman in private lodgings, for fear his cou&s;in &s;hould find him out; and in two or three months, when he has been tired of his wicked companion, <HI>emerge,</HI> as Sir Charles called it, to notice, and then &s;eek for his cou&s;in's favour and company, and live for as many more months in a &s;tate of contrition. And Sir Charles, in his great charity, believes, that till &s;ome new temptation ari&s;es, he is in earne&s;t in his penitence; and hopes, that in time he will &s;ee his errors.</P>
<P>Oh, Lucy! What a poor creeping, mean wretch is a libertine, when one looks down upon him, and up to &s;uch a glorious creature as Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on!</P>
<P>Sir Charles was led to talk of his engagement for to-morrow, on the triple marriage in the Danby fa|mily. We all gave him joy of the happy &s;ucce&s;s that had rewarded his beneficient &s;pirit, with regard to that family. He gave us the characters of the three couples greatly to their advantage, and prai&s;ed the families on both &s;ides, which were to be &s;o clo&s;ely united on the morrow; not forgetting to mention k ndly <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Mr. Sylve&s;ter the attorney.</P>
<P>He told us, that he &s;hould &s;et out on Friday early for Wind&s;or, in order to attend Lord W. in his fir&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="89">
vi&s;it to Mansfield-hou&s;e. You, Lady L. will have the trouble given you, &s;aid he, of procuring to be new-&s;et the jewels of the late Lady W. for a pre&s;ent to the future bride. My Lord &s;hewed them to me (among a great number of other valuable trinkets of his late wife's) in my la&s;t return from the Hall. They are rich, and will do credit to his quality. You, my Lord L. you, my &s;i&s;ters, will be charmed with your new aunt, and her whole family. I have joy on the happine&s;s in pro&s;pect that will gild the latter days of my mother's brother; and at the &s;ame time be a means of freeing from oppre&s;&s;ion an ancient and worthy family.</P>
<P>Our eyes all round offered, as I may &s;ay, to keep in countenance each others &s;en&s;ibility; for they all gli&s;tened. There <HI>now,</HI> thought I, &s;its this princely man, rejoicing every one who &s;ees him, and hears him &s;peak: But <HI>where</HI> will he be nine days hence? And <HI>who&s;e</HI> this day-twelve month?</P>
<P>He talked with particular plea&s;ure of the expected arrival of his Beauchamp. He plea&s;ed him&s;elf, that he &s;hould leave behind him a man who would delight every-body, and &s;upply to his friends <HI>his</HI> ab&s;ence.&mdash;What a character did he give, and Dr. Bartlett con|firm, of that amiable friend of his!</P>
<P>How did the Earl, and Lady Gertrude, dwell upon all he &s;aid! They prided them&s;elves on the relation they were likely &s;o &s;oon to &s;tand in to &s;o valuable a man.</P>
<P>In your la&s;t Letter, you tell me, Lucy, that Mr. Greville has the confidence to throw out menaces again&s;t this excellent man&mdash;Sorry wretch!&mdash;How my heart ri&s;es again&s;t him!&mdash;He&mdash;But no more of &s;uch an earth-born creature.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Morning, April <HI>6.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MISS Grandi&s;on, accompanied by Mi&s;s Jervois, has ju&s;t left us. Lady L. has undertaken, &s;he &s;ays, to &s;et all hands at work, to have things in tole|rable order, early as the day is, for Tue&s;day next. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on (would you believe it?) owns that &s;he wants &s;pirits to order any-thing. What mu&s;t be the &s;olemnity of that circum&s;tance, when near, that &s;hall make Charlotte Grandi&s;on want &s;pirits?</P>
<P>She withdrew with me to my apartment. She threw her&s;elf into a chair: 'Tis a folly to deny it, Har|riet, but I am very low, and very &s;illy: I don't like next Tue&s;day by any means.</P>
<P>Is your objection only to the day, my dear?</P>
<P>I do not like the man.</P>
<P>Is there any man whom you like better?</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay that neither. But this brother of mine makes me think contemptibly of all other men. I would compound for a man but half &s;o good; tender, kind, humane, polite, and even chearful in affliction!&mdash;O Harriet! where is there &s;uch another man?</P>
<P>No-where.&mdash;But you don't by marriage lo&s;e, on the contrary, you farther engage and &s;ecure, the af|fection of this brother. You will have a good-natu|red, worthy man for your hu&s;band; a man who loves you, and you will have your brother be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Do you think I can be happy with Lord G.?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure you may, if it be not your own fault.</P>
<P>That's the thing: I may perhaps bear with the man; but I cannot honour him.</P>
<P>Then don't <HI>vow</HI> to honour him. Don't meet him at the altar.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t. But I believe I think too much: And
<PB N="90" REF="91" MS="y">
con&s;ideration is no friend to wedlock.&mdash;Would to heaven that the &s;ame hour that my hand and Lord G.'s were joined, yours and my brother's were al&s;o united!</P>
<P>Ah, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! If you love me, try to wean me; and not to encourage hopes of what never, ne|ver can be.</P>
<P>Dear creature! You will be greater than Clemen|tina, and that is greater than the greate&s;t, if you can conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, that over-turned her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Do not, my Charlotte, make compari&s;ons in which the con&s;cience of your Harriet tells her &s;he mu&s;t be a &s;ufferer. There is no occa&s;ion for me to de&s;pi&s;e my|&s;elf, in order to hold my&s;elf inferior to Clementina.</P>
<P>Well, you are a noble creature!&mdash;But, the ap|proaching Tue&s;day&mdash;I cannot <HI>bear</HI> to think of it.</P>
<P>Dear Charlotte!</P>
<P>And dear Harriet too!&mdash;But the officiou&s;ne&s;s, the a&s;&s;iduities, of this trifling man are di&s;gu&s;tful to me.</P>
<P>You don't hate him?&mdash;</P>
<P>Hate him&mdash;True&mdash;I don't <HI>hate</HI> him&mdash;But I have been &s;o much accu&s;tomed to treat him like a fool, that I can't help thinking him one. He &s;hould not have been &s;o tame to &s;uch a &s;pirit as mine. He &s;hould have been angry when I played upon him. I have got a knack of it, and &s;hall never leave it off, that's cer|tain.</P>
<P>Then I hope he <HI>will</HI> be angry with you. I hope that he <HI>will</HI> re&s;ent your ill treatment of him.</P>
<P>Too late, too late to begin, Harriet. I won't take it of him now. He has never let me &s;ee that his face can become two &s;orts of features. The poor man can look &s;orrowful; that I know full well; But I &s;hall al|ways laugh when he attempts to look angry.</P>
<P>You <HI>know</HI> better, Charlotte. You may give him &s;o much cau&s;e for anger, that you may make it ha|bitual to him, and then would be glad to &s;ee him plea&s;ed. Men have an hundred ways that women
<PB N="91" REF="92">
have not to divert them&s;elves abroad, when they can|not be happy at home. This I have heard ob&s;erved by&mdash;</P>
<P>By your grandmother, Harriet. Good old Lady! In <HI>her</HI> reign it might be &s;o; but you will find, that women now have as many ways to divert them&s;elves abroad as the men. Have you not ob&s;erved this your|&s;elf in one of your Letters to Lucy? Ah! my dear! We can every hour of the twenty-four be up with our monarchs, if they are undutiful.</P>
<P>But Charlotte Grandi&s;on will not, cannot&mdash;</P>
<P>Why that's true, my dear&mdash;But I &s;hall not <HI>then</HI> be a Grandi&s;on. Yet the man will have &s;ome &s;ecurity from my brother's goodne&s;s. He is not only good him&s;elf, but he makes every one related to him, ei|ther from fear or &s;hame, good likewi&s;e. But I think that when one week or fortnight is happily over, and my &s;pirits are got up again from the depre&s;&s;ion into which this abominable hurry puts them, I could fall upon &s;ome inventions that would make every-one laugh, except the per&s;on who might take it into his head that he may be a &s;ufferer by them: And who can <HI>laugh,</HI> and be <HI>angry,</HI> in the &s;ame moment?</P>
<P>You &s;hould not marry, Charlotte, till this wicked vein of humour and raillery is &s;topt.</P>
<P>I hope it will hold me till fifty.</P>
<P>Don't &s;ay &s;o, Charlotte&mdash;Say rather that you hope it will hold you &s;o long only as it may be thought in|nocent or ino&s;&s;en&s;ive, by the man whom it will be your duty to oblige, and &s;o long as it will bring no di&s;credit to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Goody Gravity!&mdash;But what <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be, mu&s;t. The man is bound to &s;ee it. It will be all his own &s;eeking. He will &s;in with his eyes open. I think he has &s;een enough of me to take warning. All that I am concerned about is for the next week or fort|night. He will be king all that time&mdash;Yet perhaps not <HI>quite</HI> all neither. And I &s;hall be his &s;overeign
<PB N="92" REF="93">
ever after, or I am mi&s;taken. What a duce &s;hall a woman marry a man of talents not &s;uperior to her own, and forget to reward her&s;elf for her conde&s;cen|&s;ion?&mdash;But, high-ho!&mdash;There's a &s;igh, Harriet. Were I at home, I would either &s;ing you a &s;ong, or play you a tune, in order to rai&s;e my own heart.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought me then with great earne&s;tne&s;s, to give her my company till the day arrived, and <HI>on</HI> the day. You &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, that my brother has engage|ments till Monday. Dear creature, &s;upport, comfort me&mdash;Don't you &s;ee my heart beat thro' my &s;tays?&mdash;If you love me, come to me to-morrow to breakfa&s;t; and leave me not for the whole time&mdash;Are you not my &s;i&s;ter, and the friend of my heart? I will give you a month for it, upon demand. Come, let us go down. I will a&s;k the con&s;ent of both your cou&s;ins.</P>

<P>Sir Charles &s;et out this morning to attend the tri|ple marriages; dre&s;t charmingly, his &s;i&s;ter &s;ays. I have made Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on promi&s;e to give me an ac|count of &s;uch particulars, as by the help of Saunders, and Sir Charles's own relation, &s;he can pick up. All we &s;ingle girls, I believe, are pretty attentive to &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e; as what one day may be our own concern.</P>

<P>UNrea&s;onable, wicked, cruel, Byron! To expect a poor creature, &s;o near her execution, to write an account of other peoples behaviour in the &s;ame tremendous circum&s;tances! The matrimonial noo&s;e has hung over my head for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and now it is actually fitted to my devoted neck.&mdash;Almo&s;t
<PB N="93" REF="94">
choaked, my dear!&mdash;This moment done hearing read, the fir&s;ts, &s;econds, thirds, fourths, to near a dozen of them&mdash;Lord be merciful to us!&mdash;And the villainous lawyer rearing up to me his &s;pectacled-no&s;e, as if to &s;ee how I bore it! Lord G. in&s;ulting me, as I thought, by his odious leers: Lady Gertrude &s;imper|ing; little Emily ready to ble&s;s her&s;elf&mdash;How will the dear Harriet bear the&s;e abominable recitatives?&mdash;But I am now up &s;tairs from them all, in order to recover my breath, and obey my Byron.</P>
<P>Well, but what am I now to &s;ay about the Dan|by's? Richard has made his report; Sir Charles has told us &s;ome things: Yet I will only give you heads: Make out the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, my Brother went to Mrs. Har|rington's (Mi&s;s Danby's aunt): <HI>She</HI> did every-thing but wor&s;hip him. She had with her two young la|dies, relations of her late hu&s;band, dainty dam&s;els of the city, who had procured them&s;elves to be invited, that they might &s;ee the man whom they called, A wonder of genero&s;ity and goodne&s;s. Richard heard one of them &s;ay to the other, Ah, &s;i&s;ter! This is a king of a man! What pity there are not many &s;uch! But, Harriet, if there were an hundred of them, we would not let <HI>one</HI> of them go into the city for a wife; would we, my dear?</P>
<P>Sir Charles prai&s;ed Mi&s;s Danby. She was full of gratitude; and of humility, I &s;uppo&s;e. Meek, mo|de&s;t, and humble, are qualities of which men are mighty fond in women. But matrimony, and a &s;en&s;e of obligation, are equally great humblers even of &s;pi|rits prouder than that of Mi&s;s Danby; as your poor Charlotte can te&s;tify.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen, with the re&s;t, were to meet Sir Charles, the Bride, and the&s;e Ladies, at St. He|len's, I think the church is called.</P>
<P>As if wedlock were an honour, the Danby girl, in re&s;pect to Sir Charles, was to be fir&s;t yoked. He gave
<PB N="94" REF="95">
her away to the &s;on Galliard. The father Galliard gave his daughter to Edward Danby: But fir&s;t Mr. Hervey gave his niece to the elder.</P>
<P>One of the brides, I forget which, fainted away; another half-fainted&mdash;Sav'd by timely &s;alts: The third, poor &s;oul, wept heartily&mdash;as I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall do, on Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>Never &s;urely was there &s;uch a matrimony-promo|ter, as my brother. God give me &s;oon my revenge upon him, in the &s;ame way!</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion afterwards was triumphant&mdash;Six coaches, four &s;illy &s;ouls in each; and to Mr. Pou&s;&s;in's at Enfield they all drove. There they found another large company. My brother was all chearfulne&s;s; and both men and women &s;eemed to contend for his notice: But they were much di&s;appointed at finding he meant to leave them early in the evening.</P>
<P>One married Lady, the wife of Sir&mdash;Somebody (I am very bad at remembring the names of city|knights) was re&s;olved, &s;he &s;aid, &s;ince they could not have Sir Charles to open the Ball, to have one dance before dinner with the hand&s;ome&s;t man in England. The mu&s;ic was accordingly called in; and he made no &s;cruple to oblige the company on a day &s;o happy.</P>
<P>Do you know, Harriet, that Sir Charles is &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the fine&s;t dancers in England? Remem|ber, my dear, that on Tue&s;day&mdash;(Lord help me! I &s;hall be then &s;tupid, and remember nothing) you take him out your&s;elf: And then you will judge for your&s;elf of his excellence in this &s;cience&mdash;May we not call dancing a &s;cience? If we judge by the <HI>few</HI> who perform gracefully in it, I am &s;ure we may; and a difficult one too.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, it &s;eems, &s;o much delighted every-bo|dy, that they would not be denied his dancing with the bride that was &s;o lately Galliard, who was known to be a fine dancer. And when he had &s;o done, he took out the other two brides in turn.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
O!&mdash;And remember, Harriet, that you get &s;ome|body to call upon him to &s;ing&mdash;<HI>You</HI> &s;hall play&mdash;I believe I &s;hall f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rget in that only agreeable moment of the day (for you have a &s;weet finger, my love) that I am the principal fool in the play of the evening.</P>
<P>O Harriet I&mdash;how <HI>can I,</HI> in the circum&s;tances I am in, write any more about the&s;e &s;oft &s;ouls, and &s;illy? Come to me, my love, by day dawn, and leave me not till&mdash;I don't know when. Come, and take my part, my dear: I &s;hall hate this man: He does nothing but hop, &s;kip, and dance about me, grin and make mouths: and every-body upholds him in it. Mu&s;t this (I hope not!) be the la&s;t time that I write my&s;elf to you</P>

<P>SIR Charles Grandi&s;on &s;et out early this morning for Lord W.'s, in his way to Lady Mansfield's, I am here with this whim&s;ical Charlotte.</P>
<P>Lady L. Mi&s;s Jervois, my&s;elf, and every female of the family, or who do bu&s;ine&s;s for both &s;i&s;ters out of it, are bu&s;y in &s;ome way or other, preparatory to the ap|proaching Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on is the only idle per&s;on. I tell her, &s;he is affectedly &s;o.</P>
<P>The Earl has pre&s;ented her, in his &s;on's name, with &s;ome very rich trinkets. Very valuable jewels are al&s;o be&s;poke by Lord G. who takes Lady L.'s advice in every-thing; as one well read in the fa&s;hions. New equipages are be&s;poke; and gay ones they will be.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on confounded me this morning by an in&s;tance of her genero&s;ity. She was extremely urgent with me to accept, as her third &s;i&s;ter, of her &s;hare of
<PB N="96" REF="97">
her mother's jewels. You may believe, that I ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed &s;uch a pre&s;ent. I was angry with her; and told her, &s;he had but one way of making up with me; and that was, that &s;ince &s;he would be &s;o completely &s;et out from her Lord, &s;he would unite the two halves, by pre&s;enting hers to Lady L. who had refu&s;ed jewels from her Lord on her marriage; and who then would make an appearance, occa&s;ionally, as brilliant as her own.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed with the hint; and has actually given them (unknown to any-body but me) to her jeweller; who is to di&s;po&s;e them in &s;uch figures, as &s;hall an&s;wer tho&s;e &s;he her&s;elf is to have, which Lady L. has not. And by this contrivance, which will make them in a manner u&s;ele&s;s to her&s;elf, &s;he thinks &s;he &s;hall oblige her &s;i&s;ter, however reluctant, to ac|cept of them.</P>
<P>Lady Gertrude is al&s;o preparing &s;ome fine pre&s;ents for her niece elect: But neither the delighted appro|bation of the family &s;he is entering into, nor the &s;ati&s;|faction expre&s;&s;ed by her own friends, give the perver&s;e Charlotte any vi&s;ible joy, nor procure for Lord G. the di&s;tinction which &s;he ought to think of beginning to pay him. But, for his part, never was man &s;o happy. He would, however, perhaps, fare better from her, if he could be more moderate in the outward expre&s;|&s;ion of his joy; which &s;he has taken it into her head to call an in&s;ult upon her.</P>
<P>She does not, however, give the &s;cope &s;he did be|fore the day was fix'd, to her playful captiou&s;ne&s;s. She is not quite &s;o arch as &s;he was. Thoughtfulne&s;s, and a &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of what we are all about for her, appear in her countenance. She &s;aunters about, and affects to be diverted by her harp&s;ichord only. What a whim&s;ical thing is Charlotte Grandi&s;on? But &s;till &s;he keeps Lord G. at di&s;tance. I told her an hour ago, that &s;he knows not how to conde&s;cend to him with that grace which is &s;o natural to her in her whole behaviour to every body el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">
I have been talking to Dr. Bartlett, about Sir Charles's journey to Italy. Nobody knows, he &s;ays, what a bleeding heart is cover'd by a countenance &s;o benign, and chearful. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, has a prudence beyond that of mo&s;t young men; but he has great &s;en&s;iblities.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, Sir, that he will for the future be more an Italian than Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, madam! A <HI>prudent</HI> youth, by travel|ling, reaps this advantage&mdash;From what he &s;ees of other countries, he learns to prefer his own. An <HI>imprudent</HI> one the contrary. Sir Charles's country is endeared to him by his long ab&s;ence from it. Italy in particular is called, The Garden of Europe; but it is rather to be valued for what it <HI>was,</HI> and <HI>might he,</HI> than what <HI>it is.</HI> I need not tell a Lady who has read and conver&s;ed as you have done, to what that incom|parable difference is owing. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is greatly &s;en&s;ible of it. He loves his country, with the judgment of a wi&s;e man; and wants not the partiality of a patriot.</P>
<P>But, doctor, he has offered, you know, to re&s;ide&mdash;There I &s;topt.</P>
<P>True, madam&mdash;And he will not recede from his offers, if they are claimed. But this uncertainty it is that di&s;turbs him.</P>
<P>I pity my patron. I have often told you he is not happy. What has indi&s;cretion to expect, when di&s;|cretion has &s;o much to &s;uffer! His only con&s;olation is, that he has nothing to reproach him&s;elf with. In|evitable evils he bears as a man &s;hould. He makes no o&s;tentation of his piety: But, madam, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is a CHRISTIAN.</P>
<P>You need not, Sir, &s;ay more to me to exalt him: And, let me add, that I have no &s;mall plea&s;ure in knowing that Clementina is a Lady of &s;trict piety; tho' a Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>And let me a&s;&s;ure you, madam, that Sir Charles's
<PB N="98" REF="99">
regard for Mi&s;s Byron (his <HI>more</HI> than regard for her, why &s;hould I not &s;ay? &s;ince every-body &s;ees it) is found|ed upon her piety, and upon the amiable qualities of her mind. Beauty, madam, is an accidental and tran&s;ient good. No man better knows how to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween <HI>admiration</HI> and <HI>love,</HI> than my patron. His vir|tue is virtue upon <HI>full proof,</HI> and again&s;t &s;en&s;ibilities, that it is heroic to overcome. Lady Olivia knows this: And here I mu&s;t acknowledge my&s;elf a debtor to you for three articles out of your ten. I hope &s;oon to di&s;charge the obligation.</P>
<P>Your own time, doctor: But I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ay, that when|ever you give me Lady Olivia's &s;tory, I &s;hall be pained, if I find, that a Clementina is con&s;idered by a beauty of an <HI>unhappier</HI> turn, as <HI>her</HI> rival in the love of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia, madam, <HI>admires</HI> him for his virtue; but &s;he cannot, as <HI>he</HI> has made it his &s;tudy to do, di|vide <HI>admiration</HI> from <HI>love.</HI> What offers has &s;he not refu&s;ed?&mdash;But &s;he declares, that &s;he had rather be the <HI>friend</HI> of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, than the wife of the greate&s;t prince on earth.</P>
<P>This &s;truck me: Have not <HI>I</HI> &s;aid &s;omething like it? But &s;urely with innocence of heart. But here the doc|tor &s;ugge&s;ts, that Olivia has put his virtue to the proof: Yet I hope not.</P>
<P>The FRIEND, Dr. Bartlett!&mdash;I hope that no wo|man who is not quite given up to di&s;honour, will pollute the &s;acred word, by affixing ideas to it, that cannot be connected with it. A <HI>Friend</HI> is one of the highe&s;t characters that one human creature can &s;hine in to another. There may be <HI>Love,</HI> that tho' it has no view but to honour, yet even in wedlock, ripens not into friend&s;hip. How poor are all &s;uch attach|ments! How much beneath the exalted notion I have of that noble&s;t, that mo&s;t delicate union of &s;ouls! You wonder at me, Dr. Bartlett. Let me repeat to you, Sir (I have it by heart) Sir Charles Grandi&s;ons's
<PB N="99" REF="100">
tender of friend&s;hip to the poor Harriet Byron, which has given me &s;uch exalted ideas of this di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion; but you mu&s;t not take notice that I have. I repeated tho&s;e words, beginning, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My heart de|mands alliance with hers.</Q>&mdash;and ending with the&s;e&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">So long as it &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with her other at|tachments <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 62. of this Volume.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The doctor was &s;ilent for a few moments: At la&s;t, What a delicacy is there in the mind of this excellent man! Yet how con&s;i&s;tent with the exacte&s;t truth! The friend&s;hip he offers you, madam, is <HI>indeed</HI> friend|&s;hip. What you have repeated can want no explana|tion: Yet it is expre&s;&s;ive of his uncertain &s;ituation. It is&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt of a &s;udden.</P>
<P>Pray, doctor, proceed: I love to hear you talk.</P>
<P>My <HI>good</HI> young lady!mdash;I may &s;ay too much. Sir Charles in the&s;e nice points mu&s;t be le&s;t to him&s;elf. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any-body to expre&s;s his thoughts as <HI>he</HI> can expre&s;s them. But let me &s;ay, that he ju&s;tly, as well as greatly, admires Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>My heart ro&s;e again&s;t my&s;elf. Bold Harriet, thought I, how dare&s;t thou thus urge a good man to &s;ay more than he has a mind to &s;ay of the &s;ecrets of a friend, which are committed to his keeping? Content thy&s;elf with the <HI>hopes</HI> that the worthie&s;t man in the world would wi&s;h to call thee his, were it not for an invincible ob&s;tacle. And noble, thrice noble Clementina, be thine the preference even in the heart of Harriet Byron, becau&s;e ju&s;tice gives it to thee; for, Harriet, ha&s;t thou not been taught to prefer right and ju&s;tice to every other con&s;ideration? And, would&s;t thou abhor the thought of a common theft, yet &s;teal an heart that is the property, and that by the deare&s;t purcha&s;e, of another?</P>

<P>WE have had a great debate about the place in which the nuptial ceremony is to be performed. Char|lotte, the perver&s;e Charlotte, in&s;i&s;ted upon not going to church. Lord G. dared not to give his opinion; tho' his father and Lady Gertrude, as well as every other per&s;on, were again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Lord L. &s;aid, that if fine ladies thought &s;o &s;lightly of the office, as that it might be performed any|where, it would be no wonder, if fine gentlemen thought &s;till more &s;lightly of the obligation it laid them under.</P>
<P>Being appealed to, I &s;aid, that I thought of mar|riage as one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of a woman's life.</P>
<P>And if of a woman's, of a man's, &s;urely, interrupt|ed Lady L. If your whim&s;ey, Charlotte, added &s;he, ari&s;es from mode&s;ty, you reflect upon your &s;i&s;ter; and, what is wor&s;e, upon your mother.</P>
<P>Charlotte put up her pretty lip, and was uncom|vinced.</P>
<P>Lady Gertrude laid an heavy hand upon the affecta|tation; yet admires her niece elect. She di&s;tingui&s;hed between chamber-vows and church-vows. She menti|oned the word <HI>decency.</HI> She &s;poke plainer, on Char|lotte's unfeeling perver&s;ene&s;s. If a bride meant a com|pliment by it to the bridegroom [O dear! O dear! &s;aid Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on, and looked as if &s;he thought &s;he blu&s;hed] that was another thing; but then let her declare as much; and that &s;he was in an hurry to oblige him.</P>
<P>Charlotte attempted to kill her by a look&mdash;She gave a wor&s;e to Lord G.&mdash;And why, whi&s;pered &s;he
<PB N="101" REF="102">
to him, as he &s;at next her, mu&s;t thou &s;hew all thy teeth, man?&mdash;As Lady Gertrude meant to &s;hame her, I thought I could as &s;oon forgive that Lady, as her who was the occa&s;ion of the freedom of &s;peech.</P>
<P>But &s;till the was perver&s;e: She would not be marri|ed at all, &s;he &s;aid, if &s;he were not comply'd with.</P>
<P>I whi&s;pered her, as I &s;at on the other &s;ide of her, I wi&s;h, Charlotte, the knot were ty'd: Till then, you will not do even right things, but in a wrong manner.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett was not per&s;ent! He was making a kind vi&s;it to my cou&s;in Reeves's. When he came in, the debate was referred to him. He entered into it with her, with &s;o much mode&s;ty, good &s;en&s;e, propriety, and &s;teadine&s;s, that at la&s;t the perver&s;e creature gave way: But hardly would neither, had he not a&s;&s;ured her, that her brother would be entirely again&s;t her; and that he him&s;elf mu&s;t be excu&s;ed performing the &s;acred office, but in a &s;acred place. She has &s;et her heart on the doctor's marrying her.</P>
<P>The Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude, as al&s;o Lord and Lady L. went away, not di&s;&s;atisfied with Charlotte's compliance: She is the mo&s;t ungraciou&s;ly graceful young woman I ever knew in her compliances: But Lord G. was to pay for all: She and I had got toge|ther in the Study: In bolted Lord G. perhaps with too little ceremony. She coloured&mdash;Hey-day, Sir! Who expected you? His countenance immediately fell. He withdrew precipitately. Fie, Charlotte! &s;aid I, recol|lect your&s;elf&mdash;and ri&s;ing, &s;tept to the door, My Lord&mdash;calling after him.</P>
<P>He came back; but in a little ferment&mdash;I hoped. I hoped, madam, as you were not in your own apart|ment, that I might, that I might have been&mdash;</P>
<P>Where ever Ladies are by them&s;elves, it is a Lady's apartment, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, with an haughtine&s;s that &s;at better on <HI>her</HI> features, than they would upon almo&s;t any other woman's.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">
He looked, as if he knew not whether he &s;hould &s;tay or go. Sit down, my Lord, &s;aid I; we are not parti|cularly engaged. He came nearer, his hat under his arm, bowing to her, who &s;at as &s;tately as a prince&s;s on her throne: But yet looked di&s;obliged. You gave your&s;elf pretty airs, my Lord&mdash;don't you?</P>
<P>Pretty airs, madam!&mdash;Pretty airs!&mdash;By my Soul, I think, madam&mdash;And with &s;uch a glow in your face, madam&mdash;Taking his laced hat from under his arm, and with an earne&s;t motion &s;winging it backwards and forwards, as unknowing what he did.&mdash;</P>
<P>What, Sir, am I to be buffetted, Sir?&mdash;</P>
<P>He put his hat under his arm again&mdash;<HI>Buffeted,</HI> ma|dam!&mdash;Would to heaven&mdash;</P>
<P>What has heaven to do with your odd ways, Lord G.?</P>
<P>I beg pardon for intruding, madam&mdash;But I thought&mdash;</P>
<P>That you had a privilege, Sir&mdash;But marriage it&s;elf, Sir, &s;hall not give you a privilege to break into my re|tirements. You <HI>thought,</HI> Sir&mdash;You could <HI>not think</HI>&mdash;So much the wor&s;e if you did&mdash;</P>
<P>If I have really offended&mdash;I will be more circum|&s;pect for the future&mdash;I beg pardon, madam&mdash;Mi&s;s By|ron I hope will forgive me too.</P>
<P>He was going, in great di&s;compo&s;ure, and with an air of angry humility.</P>
<P>Charlotte, whi&s;pered I&mdash;Don't be &s;illy&mdash;</P>
<P>Come, come, now you <HI>have</HI> broke in upon us, you may &s;tay&mdash;But another time when you know me to be retired with a friend &s;o dear to me, let it enter into your head, that no third per&s;on, un&s;ent for, can be welcome.</P>
<P>Poor man!&mdash;How he loves her!&mdash;His countenance changed at once to the humble placid: He looked as if he had rather be in fault than &s;he.</P>
<P>Oh! how <HI>little</HI> did &s;he make him look!</P>
<P>But he has often, as well as in this in&s;tance, let her &s;ee her power over him. I am afraid &s;he will u&s;e it. I now &s;ee it is and will be his misfortune that &s;he can

vex him without being vexed her&s;elf: And what may he expect, who can be treated with feigned di&s;plea&s;ure, which, while it &s;eems to be in earne&s;t to him, will be a je&s;t to his wife?</P>
<P>I was very angry with her, when we were alone: and told her, that &s;he would be an enemy, I was afraid, of her own happine&s;s. But &s;he only laughed at me: Happine&s;s, my dear! &s;aid &s;he: <HI>That</HI> only is happine&s;s which we think &s;o. If I can be as happy in my way, as you can be in yours, &s;hall I not pur&s;ue it? Your happine&s;s, child, is in the &s;till life. I love not a dead calm: Now a tempe&s;t, now a refre&s;hing breeze, I &s;hall know how to enjoy the difference&mdash;My brother will not be here to turn je&s;t into earne&s;t; as might perhaps be the effect of his mediation&mdash;But, high-ho, Harriet! that the fir&s;t week were over, and I had got into my throne!</P>
<P>She ended with an Italian air, contra&s;ted with an|other High-ho; and left me for a few moments.</P>
<P>Poor Lord G.! &s;aid I looking after her.</P>
<P>She returned &s;oon. <HI>Poor Lord G.!</HI> repeated &s;he: Tho&s;e were the piteous words you threw after me&mdash;But if I &s;hould provoke him, do you think he would not give me a cuff, or &s;o?&mdash;You know he can't re|turn joke for joke; and he mu&s;t revenge him&s;elf &s;ome way&mdash;If that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, <HI>Poor Charlotte,</HI> I hope you would &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>Not if you de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>De&s;erve a cuff, Harriet!&mdash;Well, but I am afraid I &s;hall.</P>
<P>Remember next Tue&s;day, Charlotte!&mdash;You mu&s;t vow obedience&mdash;Will you break your vow?&mdash;This is not a je&s;ting matter.</P>
<P>True, Harriet. And that it is <HI>not,</HI> was perhaps one of the rea&s;ons that made me di&s;inclined to go to &s;o &s;o|lemn a place as the church with Lord G.&mdash;Don't you think it one with tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t upon being married in their own chamber?</P>

I believe great people, &s;aid I, think they mu&s;t not do right things in the common way: That &s;eems to me to be one of their fanta&s;tic rea&s;ons: But the vow is the vow, Charlotte: God is every-where.</P>
<P>Now you are &s;o &s;erious, Harriet, it is time to have done with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I HAVE no &s;leep in my eyes; and mu&s;t go on. What keeps me more wakeful is, my real concern for this naughty Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and my pity for Lord G.; for the in&s;tance I have given you of her petulance is nothing to what I have &s;een: But I thought, &s;o near the day, &s;he would have changed her behaviour to him. Surely, the &s;ituation her brother is in, without any fault of his own, might convince her, that &s;he need not go out of her path to pick up &s;ubjects for unhap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such a kitteni&s;h di&s;po&s;ition in her, I called it; for it is not &s;o much the love of power that predominates in her mind, as the love of playfulne&s;s: And when the fit is upon her, &s;he regards not whether it is a China cup, or a cork, that &s;he pats and to&s;&s;es about: But her <HI>&s;port</HI> will certainly be the <HI>death</HI> of Lord G's happine&s;s. Pity that Sir Charles, who only has power over her, is obliged to go abroad &s;o &s;oon! But &s;he has principles: Lady Grandi&s;on's daughter, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's &s;i&s;ter, mu&s;t have principles. The &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion; the office; the church; the altar;&mdash;mu&s;t &s;trike her: The vow&mdash;Will &s;he not regard the vow &s;he makes in circum&s;tances &s;o awful? Could but my Lord G. a&s;&s;ume dignity, and mingle raillery with it, and be able to laugh <HI>with</HI> her, and &s;ometimes <HI>at</HI> her, &s;he would not make <HI>him</HI> her &s;port: She would find &s;ome|body el&s;e: A butt &s;he mu&s;t have to &s;hoot at: But I am afraid he will be too &s;en&s;ible of her &s;martne&s;s: And &s;he will have her je&s;t, let who will &s;uffer by it.</P>
<P>Some of the contents of your la&s;t are very agree|able to me, Lucy. I will begin in earne&s;t to think
<PB N="105" REF="106">
of leaving London. Don't let me look &s;illy in your eyes, my dear, when I come. It was not &s;o <HI>very</HI> pre|&s;umptuous in me, was it, to hope?&mdash;When all his re|lations&mdash;When he him&s;elf&mdash;Yet what room for hope did he, <HI>could</HI> he, give me? He was hone&s;t; and I cheated my&s;elf: But then all you, my deare&s;t friends, encouraged the cheat: Nay, pointed my wi&s;hes&punc; and my hopes, by yours, before I had dared (&s;hall I &s;ay, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> conde&s;cended?) to own them to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You may let that Greville know, if your plea&s;e, that there is no room for his <HI>If</HI>'s, nor, of con&s;equence, any for his menaces. You may own, that I &s;hall &s;oon be in Northampton&s;hire. This may prevent his and Fen|wick's threatened journey to town.</P>
<P>But, Lucy, tho' my heart has been ever <HI>dutifully,</HI> as I may &s;ay, open to the venerable dome&s;tic circle; tho' it would not have been an hone&s;t heart, could it, cir|cum&s;tanced as I was, have concealed it&s;elf from Lady D.; and mu&s;t have been an impenetrable one indeed, if it could have been di&s;gui&s;ed to the two &s;i&s;ters here&mdash;yet, I be&s;eech you, my dear, almo&s;t on my knees I be&s;eech you, let not the audacious, the in&s;ulting Gre|ville, have ground given him to &s;u&s;pect a weakne&s;s in your Harriet, which indelicate minds know not how to judge of delicately. For &s;ex-&s;ake, for example|&s;ake, Lucy, let it not be known to any but the par|tial, friendly few, that our grandmamma Shirley's child, and aunt Selby's niece, has been a volunteer in her affections. How many &s;till more forward girls would plead Mrs. Shirley's approbation of the ha&s;ty affection, without con&s;idering the circum&s;tances, and the object! So the next girl that run away to a dan|cing-ma&s;ter, or an en&s;ign, would reckon her&s;elf one of Harriet's &s;chool.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Orme! I am &s;orry he is not well. It is cruel in you, Lucy, at <HI>this</HI> time, to &s;ay (&s;o un|doubtingly) that his illne&s;s is owing to his love of me.
<PB N="106" REF="107">
You knew that &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion would pain me. Hea|ven re&s;tore Mr. Orme!</P>
<P>But I am vex'd, as it cannot be to purpo&s;e, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on and I have been named together, and talked of, in your neighbourhood!&mdash;He will be gone abroad. I &s;hall return to Northampton&s;hire: And &s;hall look <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;illy! So like a refu&s;ed girl!</P>
<P>'Every-body gives me to him, you &s;ay'&mdash;So much the wor&s;e. I wonder what bu&s;ine&s;s this every-body has to trouble it&s;elf about me.</P>
<P>One con&s;olation, however, I &s;hall have in my re|turn; and that is, in my Nancy's recover'd health; which was &s;o precarious when I &s;et out for London.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall have nothing to entertain you with when I am with you: Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Lord and Lady L. Lady G. (as now in three or four days &s;he will be) my dear Mi&s;s Jervois, Dr. Bartlett, will be all my &s;ub|ject. And have I not exhau&s;ted that by pen and ink? O no! The doctor promi&s;es to corre&s;pond with me; and he makes no doubt but Sir Charles will corre&s;pond with him, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>What can the unu&s;ually tender friend&s;hip be called which he profe&s;&s;ed for me, and, as I may &s;ay, claimed in return from me? I know that he has no notion of the Love called <HI>Platonic.</HI> Nor have I: I think it, in gene|ral, a dangerous allowance; and, with regard to our &s;ex, a very unequal one; &s;ince while the man has nothing to fear, the woman has every-thing, from the privileges that may be claimed, in an <HI>acknowleged</HI> con|fidence, e&s;pecially in pre&s;ence. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on thus interprets what he &s;aid, and &s;trengthens her opinion by &s;ome of Dr. Bartlett's late intimations, that he really loves me; but not being at liberty to avow his love, he knew not what to &s;ay; and &s;o went as near to a declaration as was po&s;&s;ible to do in his circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>But might I not expect, from &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip in Sir Charles, an offer of corre&s;pondence
<PB N="107" REF="108">
in ab&s;ence? And if he made the offer, ought I to de|cline it? Would it not indicate too much on <HI>my</HI> &s;ide, were I to do &s;o?&mdash;And does it not on <HI>his,</HI> if he make not the offer? He corre&s;ponds with Mrs. Beaumont: Nobody thinks that any-thing can be meant by that corre&s;pondence on <HI>either</HI> &s;ide; becau&s;e Mrs. Beau|mount mu&s;t be at lea&s;t forty; Sir Charles but &s;ix or &s;even and twenty: But if he makes not the reque&s;t to Harriet, who is but little more than twenty; what, after &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions of a friend&s;hip &s;o tender, will be inferred from his forbearance?</P>
<P>But I &s;hall puzzle my&s;elf, and you too, Lucy, if I go on with this &s;ort of rea&s;oning; becau&s;e I &s;hall not know how to put all I mean into words. Have I not already puzzled you? I think my expre&s;&s;ion is weak and perplexed&mdash;But this offered and accepted friend|&s;hip between two per&s;ons not indelicate, mu&s;t be per|plexing; &s;ince he is the only young man in the world, from whom a woman has no di&s;honour to fear&mdash;Ah, Lucy!&mdash;It would be vanity in me, would it not? to &s;uppo&s;e that he had more to fear from Harriet, than &s;he has from him?&mdash;As the virtue of either, I hope, is not que&s;tionable: But the event of his Italian vi&s;it will explain and reconcile ever-thing.</P>
<P>I will encourage a drow&s;y fit that &s;eems to be &s;teal|ing upon me. If I have not written with the per&s;picui|ty I always aim at, allow, Lucy, for the time of night; for &s;pirits not high; and for the &s;ubject, that having its delicacies, as well as uncertainties, I am not able to write clearly upon it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday Night, April <HI>9.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SIR Charles is already returned: He arrived at Wind&s;or on Friday morning; but found that Lord
<PB N="108" REF="109">
W. had fet out the afternoon of the day before, for the hou&s;e of his friend Sir Jo&s;eph Lawrance, which is but fifteen miles from Mansfield-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this intelligence, Sir Charles, wanting to re|turn to town as &s;oon as he could, followed him to the Knight's: And having time enough him&s;elf to reach Mansfield-hou&s;e that night, he, by his uncle's con&s;ent, pur&s;ued his journey thither; to the great joy of the fa|mily; who wi&s;hed for his per&s;onal introduction of my Lord to Mi&s;s Mansfield.</P>
<P>My Lord arrived by breakfa&s;t-time, unfatigued, and in high &s;pirits: Staid at Mansfield-hou&s;e all day; and promi&s;ed &s;o to manage, as to be in town to-morrow, in order to be pre&s;ent at his niece's nuptials on Tue&s;|day.</P>
<P>As for Sir Charles, he made the Mansfield family happy in his company the whole Friday evening; en|quiring into their affairs relating to the oppre&s;&s;ion they lay under; pointing out mea&s;ures for redre&s;s; encou|raging Mi&s;s Mansfield; and informing the brothers, that the Lawyers he had con&s;ulted on their deeds, told him, that a new trial might be hoped for; the re&s;ult of which, probably, would be a means to do them ju&s;tice, &s;o powerfully protected and a&s;&s;i&s;ted as they would now be; for new lights had broke in upon them, and they wanted but to recover a deed, which they under&s;tood was in the hands of two gentlemen, nam|ed Hartley, who were but lately returned from the Indies. Thus prepared, the Mansfields al&s;o were in high &s;pirits, the next morning; and looked, Sir Char|les &s;aid, on each other, when they met as if they want|ed to tell each other their agreeable dreams.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, in his way to Sir Jo&s;eph Lawrance's, had looked in upon Sir Harry Beauchamp, and his Lady. He found Sir Harry in high &s;pirits, expecting the arrival of his &s;on; who was actually landed from Calais, having met there his Father's letter, allowing
<PB N="109" REF="110">
him to return to England, and wi&s;hing in his own, and in Lady Beauchamp's name, his &s;peedy arrival.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's impatience to &s;ee his friend, permitted him only to breakfa&s;t with my Lord and the Mans|fields; and to know the opinion each party formed of the other, on this fir&s;t interview, and then he &s;et out to Sir Harry Beauchamp's. What an activity!&mdash;Heaven reward him with the grant of his own wi&s;hes, whatever they be, and make him the happie&s;t of men!</P>
<P>My Lord is greatly taken with the Lady&punc; and her whole family, Well be may, Sir Charles &s;ays. He ble&s;&s;ed him, and called him&s;elf ble&s;&s;ed in his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, for his recommendation of each to the other. The Lady thinks better of him, as her mother own|ed to Sir Charles, than &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould, from report.</P>
<P>I begin to think, Lucy, that tho&s;e who &s;et out for happine&s;s are mo&s;t likely to find it, when they live &s;ingle till the age of <HI>fancy</HI> is over. Tho&s;e who marry while it la&s;ts, are often di&s;appointed of that which they propo&s;e &s;o largely to them&s;elves: While tho&s;e who wed for convenience, and deal with tolerable hone&s;ty by each other, are at a greater certainty. <HI>Tolerable,</HI> I repeat, &s;ince, it &s;eems, we are not to expect that both parties will turn the be&s;t &s;ide of the old garment outward. Hence ari&s;es con&s;olation to old maidens, and cautions again&s;t precipitation&mdash;Expatiate, my dear, on this fruitful &s;ubject: I would, were I at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;ays, that he doubts not, but Lord W. will be as happy a man as he wi&s;hes to be, in le&s;s than a month.</P>
<P>The duce is in this brother of mine, whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, to me, for huddling up of marriages! He don't con&s;ider, that ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay be two chances for one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> hone&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n half a year's time, ble&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="5 letters">.</P>
<P>Sir Charles told us, that he had de&s;ired Lord W.
<PB N="110" REF="111">
to give out every-where (that the adver&s;aries of the Mansfield family might know it) his intended alli|ance; and that he and his nephew were both deter|mined to procure a retro&s;pection of all former pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>Sir Charles got to Sir Harry Beauchamp's a little be|fore his friend arrived. Sir Harry took him a&s;ide at his alighting, and told him, that Lady Beauchamp had had clouds on her brow all the day, and he was afraid, would not receive his &s;on with the graciou&s;|ne&s;s that once he hoped for from her: But that he left <HI>him</HI> to manage with her. She never, &s;aid he, had &s;o high an opinion either of man or woman as &s;he has of you.</P>
<P>Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her, as not doubt|ing her goodne&s;s upon the foot of their former con|ver&s;ation; and prai&s;ed her for the graces that however appeared but faintly in her countenance, till his com|pliments lighted them up, and made them &s;hine full out in it. He told her, that his &s;i&s;ter and Lord G. were to be married on the following Tue&s;day. He him&s;elf, he &s;aid, &s;hould &s;et out for Paris on Friday after: but hoped to &s;ee a family intimacy begun be|tween his &s;i&s;ters and Lady Beauchamp; and between their Lords, and Sir Harry, and Mr. Beauchamp. He applauded her on the genero&s;ity of her intentions, as declared to him in their former conference; and con|gratulated her on the power &s;he had, of which &s;he made &s;o noble an u&s;e, of laying, at the &s;ame time, an obligation on the tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands, and the mo&s;t de&s;erving of &s;ons: Who&s;e duty to her he en|gaged for.</P>
<P>All this &s;et her in high good humour; and &s;he took to her&s;elf, and <HI>bridled</HI> upon it, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in Charlotte's manner, the prai&s;es and graces this adroit manager gave her, as if they were her unque|&s;tionable due.</P>
<P>This agreeable way they were all in, Sir Harry
<PB N="111" REF="112">
tran&s;ported with his Lady's goodne&s;s, when Mr. Beau|champ arrived.</P>
<P>The young gentleman bent his knee to his &s;tep|mother, as well as to his father, and thanked her for the high favours his father had &s;ignified to him by Let|ter, that he owed to her goodne&s;s. She confirmed them; but, Sir Charles ob&s;erved, with an o&s;tentation that &s;hewed &s;he thought very highly of her own gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>They had a very chearful evening. Not one could would hang on Lady Beauchamp's brow, tho' once or twice it &s;eemed a little over&s;hadowed, as Mr. Beau|champ di&s;played qualities for which his father was too ready to admire him. Sir Charles thought it nece&s;&s;ary to caution Sir Harry on this &s;ubject; putting it in this light, that Lady Beauchamp loved her hu&s;band &s;o well, that &s;he would be too likely to dread a rivalry in his affections from a &s;on &s;o very accompli&s;hed. Sir Harry took the hint kindly.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp was under a good deal of concern at Sir Charles's engagements to leave England &s;o &s;oon after his arrival; and asked his father's leave to attend him. Sir Harry declared, that he could not part with him. Sir Charles chid his friend, and &s;aid, It was not quite &s;o hand&s;ome a return to the joyful reception he had met with from Lady Beauchamp, and his father, as might have been expected from his Beauchamp; bow|ing to the Lady. But &s;he excu&s;ed the young gentle|man, and &s;aid, &s;he wondered not, that any-body who was favoured with <HI>his</HI> friend&s;hip, &s;hould be unwilling to be &s;eparated from him.</P>
<P>Sir Charles expre&s;&s;es great &s;atisfaction in Mr. Beau|champ's being arrived before his departure, that he may pre&s;ent to us, him&s;elf, a man with whom he is &s;ure we &s;hall all be delighted, and leave <HI>him</HI> happy in that beloved &s;ociety, which he him&s;elf is obliged to quit.</P>
<P>A repining temper, Lucy, would con&s;ider only the
<PB N="112" REF="113">
hard&s;hip of meeting a long-ab&s;ent friend, ju&s;t to feel the unea&s;ine&s;s of a &s;econd parting: But this man views every-thing in a right light. When his own happine&s;s is not to be attained, he lays it out of his thoughts, and, as I have heretofore ob&s;erved, rejoices in that of others. It is a plea&s;ure to &s;ee how Sir Charles &s;eems to enjoy the love which Dr. Bartlett ex|pre&s;&s;es for his friend of them both.</P>
<P>Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him, on &s;everal oc|ca&s;ions, in &s;o polite, in &s;o tender a manner, that every One told me afterwards, they are &s;ure he loves me. Dr. Bartlett at the time, as he &s;at next me, whi&s;pered, on the regret expre&s;&s;ed by all on lo&s;ing him &s;o &s;oon&mdash;Ah, madam!&mdash;I know, and pity, my patron's &s;trug|gles!&mdash;<HI>Struggles,</HI> Lucy! What could the doctor mean by this whi&s;per to <HI>me?</HI> But I hope he gue&s;&s;es not at mine! If he does, would he have whi&s;pered his pity of Sir Charles to me?&mdash;Come, Lucy, this is &s;ome comfort, however; and I will endeavour to be brave upon it, that I may not, by my weakne&s;s, le&s;&s;en my&s;elf in the doctor's good opinion.</P>
<P>It was agreed for Charlotte, who&s;e a&s;&s;ent was given in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Do as you will&mdash;or, rather, as my brother will.&mdash;What &s;ignifies oppo&s;ing him?'</Q> that the nuptials &s;hall be &s;olemnized, as privately as po&s;&s;i|ble, at St. George's church. The company is to drop in at different doors, and with as few attendants as may be. Lord W. the Earl of G. and Lady Ger|trude, Lord and Lady L. Mi&s;s Jervois, and your Har|riet, are to be pre&s;ent at the ceremony. I was very earne&s;t to be excu&s;ed, till Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, when we were alone, dropt down on one knee, and held up her hands, to beg me to accompany her. Mr. Everard Grandi&s;on, if he can be found, is to be al&s;o there, at Sir Charles's de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, as I before hinted, at her earne&s;t re|que&s;t, is to perform the ceremony. Sir Charles wi&s;hed it to be at his own Pari&s;h church: But Mi&s;s
<PB N="113" REF="114">
Grandi&s;on thought it too near to be private. He was indifferent as to the place&punc; he &s;aid&mdash;So it was at <HI>church;</HI> for he had been told of the difficulty we had to get Charlotte to de&s;i&s;t from having it performed in her chamber; and &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;Fie, Charlotte! &s;aid be&mdash;An office &s;o &s;olemn!&mdash;Vows to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eive and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay as in the Divine Pre&s;ence&mdash;</P>

<P>LORD W. is come. Lord and Lady L. are here. They, and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on received him with great re&s;pect. He embraced his nieces in a very affectionate manner. Sir Charles was ab&s;ent. Lord W. is in per&s;on and behaviour a much more agreeable man than I expected him to be. Nor is he &s;o decrepit with the gout, as I had &s;uppo&s;ed. He is very careful of him&s;elf, it &s;eems. This world has been kind to him; and I fancy he makes a great deal of a little pain, for want of &s;tronger exerci&s;es to his patience; and &s;o is a &s;ufferer by &s;elf-indulgence. Had I not been made acquainted with his free living, and with the in&s;ults he bore from Mrs. Giffard, with a &s;pirit &s;o poor and &s;o low, I &s;hould have believed I &s;aw not only the man of quality, but the man of &s;en&s;e, in his countenance. I endeavoured, however, as much as I could, to look upon him as the brother of the late Lady Grandi&s;on. Had he been worthy of that rela|tion, how &s;hould I have reverenced him!</P>
<P>But whatever I thought of <HI>him,</HI> he was highly taken with me. He particularly prai&s;ed me for the mode&s;ty which he &s;aid was vi&s;ible in my countenance. Free livers, Lucy, taken with that grace in a woman, which they make it their pride to de&s;troy! But all men, good and bad, admire mode&s;ty in a woman: And I am &s;ometimes out of humour with our &s;ex, that they do not as gene|rally like mode&s;ty in men. I am &s;ure that this grace, in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, is one of his principal glories
<PB N="114" REF="115">
with me. It emboldens one's heart, and permits one to behave before him with ea&s;e; and, as I may &s;ay, with <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a right intention.</P>
<P>But what were Lord W's prai&s;es of his nephew! He called him, The glory of his &s;ex, and of human nature. How the cheeks of the dear Emily glowed at the prai&s;es given to her guardian!&mdash;She was the taller for them: When &s;he moved, it was on tiptoe; &s;tealing, as it were, cro&s;s the floor, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e any-thing that was &s;aid on a &s;ubject to delightful to her.</P>
<P>My Lord was greatly plea&s;ed with her too. He complimented her as the beloved ward of the be&s;t of guardians. He lamented, with us, the occa&s;ion that called his nephew abroad. He was full of his own en|gagements with Mi&s;s Mansfield, and declared that his nephew &s;hould guide and govern him as he plea&s;ed in every material ca&s;e, re&s;pecting either the conduct of his future life, or the management and di&s;po&s;ition of his e&s;tate; declaring, that he had made his will, and, re&s;erving only his Lady's jointure, and a few legacies, had left every-thing to him.&mdash;How right a thing, even in policy, is it, my dear, to be a good, and a generous man!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget, that my Lord wi&s;hed, <HI>with all his &s;oul,</HI> that was his expre&s;&s;ion, that he might have the honour of giving to his nephew <HI>my</HI> hand in mar|riage.</P>
<P>I could feel my&s;elf blu&s;h. I half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh: I would have wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it, if I could. I re|covered the little confu&s;ion, his too plainly expre&s;&s;ed wi&s;h gave me, by repeating to my&s;elf the word <HI>Cle|mentina.</HI></P>
<P>This Charlotte is a great coward. But I dare not tell her &s;o, for fear of a retort. I believe I &s;hould be as great a one in her circum&s;tances, &s;o few hours to one of the greate&s;t events of one's life! But I pretend not to bravery: Yet hope, that in the cau&s;e of virtue or honour I &s;hould be found to have a Soul.</P>

<P>MISS Grandi&s;on is no longer to be called by that name. She is Lady G. May &s;he make Lord G. as happy as I dare &s;ay he will make her, if it be not her own fault.</P>
<P>I was early with her according to promi&s;e. I found her more affected than &s;he was even la&s;t night with her approaching change of condition. Her brother had been talking to her, &s;he &s;aid; and had laid down the duties of the &s;tate &s;he was about to enter into, in &s;uch a &s;erious manner, and made the performance of them of &s;o much importance to her happine&s;s both here and hereafter, that &s;he was terrified at the thoughts of what &s;he was about to undertake. She had never con&s;idered matrimony in that formidable light before. He had told her, that he was afraid of her vivacity; yet was loth to di&s;courage her chearfulne&s;s, or to &s;ay any-thing that &s;hould lower her &s;pirits. All he be|&s;ought of her was, to regard times, tempers, and oc|ca&s;ions; and then it would be impo&s;&s;ible but her lively humour mu&s;t give delight not only to the man whom &s;he favoured with her hand, but to every one who had the plea&s;ure of approaching her. If, Charlotte, &s;aid he, you would have the world around you re&s;pect your hu&s;band, <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t &s;et the example. While the wife gives the lea&s;t room to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he de&s;pi&s;es her hu&s;band, &s;he will find, that &s;he &s;ubjects him to double contempt, if he re&s;ents it not; and if he does, can
<PB N="116" REF="117">
you be happy? Aggre&s;&s;ors lay them&s;elves open to &s;e|vere repri&s;als. If you differ you will be apt to make by-&s;tanders judges over you. They will remember when you are willing to forget; and your fame will be the &s;port of tho&s;e beneath you, as well in under&s;tand|ing as degree.</P>
<P>She believed, &s;he told me, that Lord G. had been making &s;ome complaints of her. <HI>If he had</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, my dear, &s;aid I&mdash;Not one word of threaten|ing: Are you more &s;olicitous to conceal your fault, than to mend it?</P>
<P>No&mdash;But you know, Harriet, for a man, before he has experienced what &s;ort of a wife I &s;hall make, to complain again&s;t me for foibles in court&s;hip, when he can help him&s;elf if he <HI>will,</HI> has &s;omething &s;o very little&mdash;</P>
<P>Your con&s;cience, Charlotte, tells you, that he had <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for complaint; and therefore you think he <HI>has</HI> complained. Think the be&s;t of Lord G. for <HI>your own</HI> reputation's &s;ake, &s;ince you thought fit to go thus far with him. You have borne nothing from him: He has borne a great deal from you.</P>
<P>I am fretful, Harriet: I won't be chidden: I will be comforted by you: You <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;ooth me: Are you not my &s;i&s;ter? She threw her arms round me, and ki&s;&s;ed my check.</P>
<P>I ventured to railly her, tho' I was afraid of her re|tort, and met with it: But I thought it would divert her. I am glad, my dear, &s;aid I, that you are capa|ble of this tenderne&s;s of temper: You blu&s;tering girls&punc;&mdash;But Fear, I believe, will make cowards loving.</P>
<P>Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, and flung from me to the window, remember <HI>this:</HI> May I &s;oon &s;ee you in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation! I will then have no mercy upon you.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject, which Sir Charles led to at breakfa&s;t, was the three weddings of Thur&s;day la&s;t. He &s;poke
<PB N="117" REF="118">
honourably of marriage, and made &s;ome ju&s;t compli|ments to Lord and Lady L.; concluding them with wi&s;hes, that his &s;i&s;ter Charlotte and Lord G. might be neither more nor le&s;s happy than they were. Then turning to Lord W. he &s;aid, He que&s;tioned not his Lord&s;hip's happine&s;s with the lady he had &s;o lately &s;een; for I cannot doubt, &s;aid he, of your Lord&s;hip's affectionate gratitude to her, if &s;he behaves, as I am &s;ure &s;he will.</P>
<P>My Lord had tears in his eyes. Never man had &s;uch a nephew as I have, &s;aid he. &s;aid he. All the joy of my pre&s;ent pro&s;pects, all the comforts of my future life, are and will be owing to you.</P>
<P>Here had he &s;topt, it would have been well; But turning to me, he unexpectedly &s;aid, Would to God, madam, that YOU could reward him! I cannot; and nobody <HI>el&s;e</HI> can.</P>
<P>All were alarmed for me; every eye was upon me. A &s;icki&s;hne&s;s came came over my heart&mdash;I know not how to de&s;cribe it. My head &s;unk upon my bo&s;om. I could hardly &s;it; yet was le&s;s able to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's face was over&s;pread with blu&s;hes. He bowed to my Lord. May the man, &s;aid he, who &s;hall have the honour to call Mi&s;s Byron his, be, if <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> as de&s;erving as <HI>&s;he</HI> is! Then will they live together the life of angels.</P>
<P>He gracefully looked down, not at me; and I got a little courage to look up: Yet Lady L. was con|cerned for me: So was Lord L.: Emily's eye dropt a tear upon her blu&s;hing cheek.</P>
<P>Was it not, Lucy, a &s;evere trial?&mdash;Indeed it was.</P>
<P>My Lord, to mend the matter, lamented very pa|thetically, that Sir Charles was under an obligation to go abroad; and &s;till more, that he could not &s;tay to be pre&s;ent at the celebration of his nuptials with Mi&s;s Mansfield.</P>
<P>The Earl, Lord G. Lady Gertrude, and the Doctor, were to meet the Bride and us at church. Lord and
<PB N="118" REF="119">
Lady L. Sir Charles, and Emily, went in one coach: Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on and I in another.</P>
<P>As we went, I don't like this affair at all, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he. My brother has long made all other men in|different to me. Such an infinite difference!</P>
<P>Can any-body be happier than Lord and Lady L. Charlotte? Yet Lady L. admires her brother as much as you can do.</P>
<P><HI>They</HI> happy!&mdash;And <HI>&s;o</HI> they are. But Lady L. &s;oft &s;oul! fell in love with Lord L. before my brother came over. So the foundation was laid: And it being a fir&s;t flame with her, &s;he, in compliment to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> could not but per&s;evere. But the &s;orry creature An|der&s;on, proving a &s;orry creature, made me de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ex: And my brother's perfections contributed to my contempt of all other men.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you are wrong. Lord G. loves you: But were Sir Charles not your brother, it is not very certain, that he would have returned your Love.</P>
<P>Why, that's true. I believe he would not, in that ca&s;e, have cho&s;en <HI>me.</HI> I am &s;ure he would not, if he had known <HI>you:</HI> But for the man one loves, one can <HI>do</HI> any-thing, <HI>be</HI> every-thing, that he would wi&s;h one to be.</P>
<P>Do you think you cannot love Lord G.?&mdash;For Hea|ven's &s;ake, Charlotte, tho' you are now almo&s;t within &s;ight of the church, do not think of giving your hand, if you cannot re&s;olve to make Lord G. as happy, as I have no doubt he will make you, if it be not your own fault.</P>
<P>What will my brother &s;ay? What will&mdash;</P>
<P>Leave that to me. I will engage Sir Charles and Dr. Bartlett to lend me their ear in the ve&s;try; and I am &s;ure your brother, if he knows that you have an antipathy to Lord G. or that you think you caonot be happy with him, will undertake your cau&s;e, and bring you off.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
<HI>Antipathy!</HI> That's a &s;trong word, Harriet. The man is a good natured &s;illy man&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Silly!</HI> Charlotte!&mdash;Silly then he mu&s;t be for loving you &s;o well, who, really, have never yet given him an opportunity to &s;hew his importance with you.</P>
<P>I do pity him &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>The coach &s;topt&mdash;Ah, Lord! Harriet! The church! The church!</P>
<P>Say, Charlotte, before you &s;tep out&mdash;Shall I &s;peak to your brother, and Dr. Bartlett, in the ve&s;try?</P>
<P>I &s;hall look like a fool either way.</P>
<P>Don't <HI>act</HI> like one, Charlotte, on this &s;olemn occa|&s;ion. Say, you will de&s;erve, that you will <HI>try</HI> to de|&s;erve, Lord G's love.</P>
<P>Lord help me!&mdash;My brother!&mdash;I'll try, I'll try, what can be done.</P>
<P>Sir Charles appeared. He gave each his hand in turn: In we flew: The people began to gather about us. Lord G. all rapture, received her at the entrance. Sir Charles led me: And the Earl and Lady Gertrude received us with joy in their countenances. I over|heard the naughty one &s;ay, as Lord G. led her up to the altar, You don't know what you are about, man. I expect to have all my way: Remember that's one of my articles before marriage.</P>
<P>He returned her an an&s;wer of fond a&s;&s;ent to her condition. I am afraid, thought I, poor Lord G. you will be more than once reminded of this previous article.</P>
<P>When &s;he was led to the altar, and Lord G. and &s;he &s;tood together, &s;he trembled. Leave me not, Har|riet, &s;aid the&mdash;Brother! Lady L.!</P>
<P>I am &s;ure &s;he looked <HI>&s;ilier</HI> than Lord G. at that in|&s;tant.</P>
<P>The good doctor began the office. <HI>No dearly be|laveds,</HI> Harriet! whi&s;pered &s;he, as I had &s;aid, on a really terrible occa&s;ion. I was offended with her in my heart: Again &s;he whi&s;pered &s;omething again&s;t the
<PB N="120" REF="121">
office, as the doctor proceeded to give the rea&s;ons for the in&s;titution. Her levity did not for&s;ake her even at that &s;olemn moment.</P>
<P>When the Service was over, every one (Sir Charles in a &s;olemn and mo&s;t affectionate manner) wi&s;hed her happy. My Lord G. ki&s;&s;ed her hand with a bent knee.</P>
<P>She took my hand. Ah! Lord, what have I done?&mdash;And am I married? whi&s;pered &s;he&mdash;And can it ne|ver be undone?&mdash;And is that the man, to whom I am to be obedient?&mdash;Is <HI>he</HI> to be my Lord and Ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>Ah, Lady G. &s;aid I, it is a &s;olemn office. <HI>You</HI> have vowed: <HI>He</HI> has vowed.&mdash;It is a &s;olemn office.</P>
<P>Lord G. led her to the fir&s;t coach. Sir Charles led me into the &s;ame. The people, to my great confu&s;ion, whi&s;pered. That's the Bride! What a charming cou|ple! Sir Charles handed Mi&s;s Emily next. Lord G. came in: As he was entering, Harkee, friend, &s;aid Charlotte, and put out her hand, You mi&s;take the coach: You are not of our company.</P>
<P>The whole world, reply'd my Lord, &s;hall not now divide us: And took his &s;eat on the &s;ame &s;ide with Emily.</P>
<P>The man's a rogue, Harriet, whi&s;pered &s;he: See! He gives him&s;elf airs already!</P>
<P>This, &s;aid Lord G. as the coach drove on, taking one hand and eagerly ki&s;&s;ing it, is the hand that ble&s;|&s;ed me.</P>
<P>And that, &s;aid &s;he, pu&s;hing him from her with the other, is the hand that repul&s;es your forwardne&s;s. What came you in here for?&mdash;Don't be &s;illy.</P>
<P>He was in raptures all the way.</P>
<P>When he came home, every-one embraced and wi&s;hed joy to the Bride. The Earl and Lady Ger|trude were in high &s;pirits. The Lady re-&s;aluted her niece. as her <HI>dear</HI> niece: The Earl recognized his be|loved daughter.</P>
<P>But prepare to hear a noble action of Lord W.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">
When he came up to compliment her&mdash;My deare&s;t niece, &s;aid he, I wi&s;h you joy with all my &s;oul. I have not been a kind uncle. There is no fa&s;tening any-thing on your brother. Accept of this; [and he put a little paper into her hand&mdash;It was a Bank-note of 1000 <HI>l.</HI>] <HI>My</HI> &s;i&s;ter's daughter, and <HI>your</HI> brother's &s;i&s;ter, merits more than this.</P>
<P>Was not this hand&s;omely pre&s;ented, Lucy?</P>
<P>He then, in a manner becoming Lady Grandi&s;on's brother, &s;tept to Lady L. My niece, Charlotte, is not my <HI>only</HI> niece. I wi&s;h you, my dear, as if this was <HI>your</HI> day of marriage, all happine&s;s; accept the&s;e two papers [The one, Lucy, was a note for 1000 <HI>l.</HI> and the other for 100 <HI>l.</HI>]: And he &s;aid, The le&s;&s;er note is due to you for intere&s;t on the greater.</P>
<P>When the Ladies opened their notes, and &s;aw what they were, they were at fir&s;t at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>It was mo&s;t gracefully done: But &s;ee, Lucy, the example of a good and generous man can &s;ometimes alter natures; and covetous men, I have heard it ob&s;erved, when their hearts are open'd, often act nobly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Lady G. (So now I mu&s;t call her) re|covered her&s;elf from the &s;urprize into which my Lord's pre&s;ent and addre&s;s had put her, &s;he went to him: Allow me, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, and bent one knee to him, to crave your ble&s;&s;ing; and at the &s;ame time to thank you for your paternal pre&s;ent to your ever ob|liged Charlotte.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, my dear! &s;aluting her&mdash;But thank your noble brother: You delight me with your grace|ful acceptance.</P>
<P>Lady L. came up. My Lord, you overcome me by your bounty.&mdash;How &s;hall I&mdash;</P>
<P>Your brother's princely &s;pirit, Lady L. &s;aid he, makes this pre&s;ent look mean. Forgive me only, that it was not done before. And he &s;aluted her.</P>
<P>Lord L. came up. Lady L. &s;hew'd him the open'd
<PB N="122" REF="123">
notes&mdash;See here, my Lord &s;aid &s;he, what Lord W. has done: And he calls this the intere&s;t due on that.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip oppre&s;&s;es me with your goodne&s;s to your niece, &s;aid Lord L. May health, long-life, and happine&s;s, attend you in your own nuptials!</P>
<P>There, there, &s;aid Lord W. pointing to Sir Charles (who had withdrawn, and then entered) make your acknowlegement: His noble &s;pirit has awakened mine: It was only a&s;leep. My late &s;i&s;ter's brother wanted but the force of &s;uch an example. That &s;on is all his mother.</P>
<P>Sir Charles joining them, having heard only the la&s;t words.&mdash;If I am thought a &s;on not unworthy of the mo&s;t excellent of mothers, &s;aid he, and by <HI>her</HI> brother, I am happy.</P>
<P>Then you <HI>are</HI> happy, reply'd my Lord.</P>
<P>Her memory, re&s;umed Sir Charles, I cheri&s;h; and when I have been tempted to forget my&s;elf, that me|mory has been a means of keeping me &s;teady in my duty. Her precepts, my Lord, were the guide of my early youth. Had I not kept them in mind, how much more blameable than mo&s;t young men had I been!&mdash;My Charlotte! Have that mother in your memory, on this great change of your condition! You will not be called to her tryals.&mdash;His eyes gli&s;ten'd. Tender be our remembrance of my father.&mdash;Char|lotte, be worthy of your mother!</P>
<P>He withdrew with an air <HI>&s;o</HI> noble!&mdash;But &s;oon re|turning, with a chearful look, he was told what Lord W. had done&mdash;Your Lord&s;hip was <HI>before,</HI> &s;aid he, intitled to our duty, by the ties of blood: But what is the relation of body to that of mind? You have bound me for my &s;i&s;ters, and that &s;till more by the manner, than by the act, in a bond of gratitude that never can be broken!</P>
<P>Thank your&s;elf, thank your&s;elf, my noble ne|phew.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
Encourage, my Lord, a family intimacy between your Lady, and her nieces and nephews. You will be delighted, my &s;i&s;ters, with Mi&s;s Mansfield; but when &s;he obliges my Lord with her hand, you will reverence your aunt. I &s;hall have a plea&s;ure, when I am far di&s;tant, in contemplating the family union. Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t let me know your Day in time; and I will be joyful upon it, whatever, of a contrary nature, I may have to &s;truggle with on my own ac|count.</P>
<P>My Lord wept&mdash;My <HI>Lord</HI> wept, did I &s;ay?&mdash;Not <HI>one</HI> of us had a dry eye!&mdash;This was a &s;olemn &s;cene, you will &s;ay, for a wedding-day: But how delight|fully do &s;uch &s;cenes dilate the heart?</P>
<P>The day, however, was not forgotten as a day of fe&s;tivity. Sir Charles him&s;elf, by his vivacity and openne&s;s of countenance, made every one joyful: And, except that now-and-then a &s;igh, which could not be check'd, &s;tole from &s;ome of us, to think that he would &s;o &s;oon be in another country (far di&s;tant from the friends he now made happy) and engaged in difficulties; perhaps in dangers; every heart was pre|&s;ent to the occa&s;ion of the day.</P>
<P>O Charlotte! Dear Lady G.! Hitherto, it is in your power, to make every <HI>future</HI> day, worthy of <HI>this!</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Have your mother, your noble mother, in your memory, my dear:'</Q> And give credit to the appro|tion of &s;uch a brother.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, that my cou&s;in Reeves's came about two, and were received with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s by every-body.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was called out ju&s;t before dinner; and returned introducing a young gentleman, dre&s;&s;ed as if for the day&mdash;This is an earlier favour, than I had hoped for, &s;aid Sir Charles; and leading him to Lady G. This, Sir, is the Queen of the Day. My dear Lady G. welcome (The hou&s;e is yours&mdash;Welcome) the man I love: Welcome my Beauchamp.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">
Every one, except Emily and me, crouded about Mr. Beauchamp, as Sir Charles's avowedly beloved friend, and bid him cordially welcome; Sir Charles pre&s;ented him to each by name.</P>
<P>Then leading him to me&mdash;I am half a&s;hamed, Lucy, to repeat&mdash;But take it as he &s;poke it&mdash;Revere, &s;aid he, my dear friend, that excellent young Lady: But let not your admiration &s;top at her Face and Per|&s;on: She has a Mind as exalted, my Beauchamp, as your own. Mi&s;s Byron, in honour to my &s;i&s;ter, and of us all, has gilded this day by her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp re&s;pectfully took my hand; For|give me, madam, bowing upon it&mdash;I <HI>do</HI> revere you. The Lady whom Sir Charles Grandi&s;on admires, as he does you, mu&s;t be the fir&s;t of women.</P>
<P>I might have &s;aid, that he, who was &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed as the friend of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, mu&s;t be a mo&s;t valuable man: But my &s;pirits were not high. I courte&s;ied to his compliment; and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sir Charles pre&s;ented Emily to him.&mdash;My Emily, Beauchamp. I hope to live to &s;ee her happily mar|ried. The man who&s;e heart is but half &s;o worthy as hers, mu&s;t be an excellent man.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty might look up, and be &s;en&s;ible to com|pliments from the lips of &s;uch a man. Emily looked at me with plea&s;ure, as if &s;he had &s;aid, Do you hear, madam, what a fine thing my guardian has &s;aid of me?</P>
<P>Sir Charles a&s;ked Mr. Beauchamp, how he &s;tood with my Lady Beauchamp?</P>
<P>Very well, an&s;wered he. After &s;uch an introduc|tion as you had given me to her, I mu&s;t have been to blame, had I <HI>not.</HI> She is my father's wife: I mu&s;t re&s;pect her, were &s;he ever &s;o unkind to me: She is not without good qualities. Were every family &s;o happy as to have Sir Charles Grandi&s;on for a mediator when mi&s;under&s;tandings happened, there would be very few
<PB N="125" REF="126">
la&s;ting differences among relations. My father and mother tell me, that they never &s;it down to table to|gether, but they ble&s;s you: And to me they have talked of nobody el&s;e: But Lady Beauchamp depends upon your promi&s;e of making her acquainted with the Ladies of your family.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ters, and their Lords, will do honour to my promi&s;e in my ab&s;ence. Lady L. Lady G. let me recommend to you Lady Beauchamp as more than a common vi&s;iting acquaintance. Do you, Sir, to Mr. Beauchamp, &s;ee it cultivated.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp is an agreeable, and, when Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is not in company, hand&s;ome and genteel man. I think, my dear, that I do but the &s;ame ju&s;tice that every body would do, in this ex|ception. He is chearful, lively, yet mode&s;t, and not too full of words. One &s;ees both love and re&s;pect in every look he ca&s;ts upon his friend; and that he is delighted when he hears him &s;peak, be the &s;ubject what it will. He once &s;aid to Lord W. who prai&s;ed his nephew to him, as he does to every-body near him; The univer&s;al voice, my Lord, is in his favour where-ever he goes. Every one joins almo&s;t in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> words, in different countries, allowing for the different languages, that for &s;weetne&s;s of manners, and manly dignity, he hardly ever had his equal.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was then engaged in talk with his Emily; &s;he before him; he &s;tanding in an ea&s;y genteel atti|tude, leaning again&s;t the wain&s;cot, li&s;tening, &s;miling, to her prattle, with looks of indulgent love, as a fa|ther might do to a child he was fond of; while &s;he looked back every now-and-then towards me, <HI>&s;o</HI> proud, poor dear! of being &s;ingled out by her guar|dian.</P>
<P>She tript to me afterwards, and leaning over my &s;houlder, as I &s;at, whi&s;pered&mdash;I have been begging of my guardian to u&s;e his intere&s;t with you, madam, to take me down with you to Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">
And what is the re&s;ult?&mdash;She pau&s;ed.&mdash;Has he de|nied your reque&s;t?&mdash;No, madam&mdash;Has he allowed you to go, my dear, if I comply? turning half round to her with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed at a lo&s;s. I repeated my que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Why, no, he has not con&s;ented neither&mdash;But he &s;aid &s;uch charming things, &s;o obliging, &s;o kind, both of you, and of me, that I forgot my que&s;tion, tho' it was &s;o near my heart: But I will a&s;k him again.</P>
<P>And thus, Lucy, can he decline complying, and yet &s;end away a reque&s;ter &s;o much delighted with him, as to forget what her reque&s;t was.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;Lady G. I would &s;ay&mdash;&s;ingled me out &s;oon after&mdash;This Beauchamp is really a very pretty fellow, Harriet.</P>
<P>He is an agreeable man, an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>So I think. She &s;aid no more of him at that time.</P>
<P>Between dinner and tea, at Lady L.'s motion, they made me play on the harp&s;ichord; and after one le&s;|&s;on, they be&s;ought Sir Charles to &s;ing to my playing. He would not, he &s;aid, deny any reque&s;t that was made him on that day.</P>
<P>He &s;ung. He has a mellow manly voice, and great command of it.</P>
<P>This introduced a little concert. Mr. Beauchamp took the violin; Lord L. the ba&s;s-viol; Lord G. the German-flute; Lord W. &s;ung ba&s;e; Lady L. Lady G. and the Earl, joined in the chorus. The &s;ong was from Alexander's Fea&s;t: The words,
<Q><L>Happy, happy, happy pair!</L>
<L>None but the <HI>good</HI> de&s;erves the fair;</L></Q>
Sir Charles, tho' him&s;elf equally <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> pre&s;erring the latter word to the former.</P>
<P>Lady L. had always in&s;i&s;ted upon dancing at her &s;i&s;ter's wedding. We were not company enough for country dances: But mu&s;ic having been order'd, and

the performers come, it was in&s;i&s;ted upon that we &s;hould have a dance, tho' we were engaged in a con|ver&s;ation, that I thought infinitely more agreeable.</P>
<P>Lord G. began with dancing a minuet with his bride; She danced charmingly: But on my telling her &s;o af|terwards, &s;he whi&s;pered me, that &s;he &s;hould have per|formed better, had &s;he danced with her brother. Lord G. danced extremely well.</P>
<P>Lord L. and Lady Gertrude, Mr. Beauchamp and Mrs. Reeves, Mr. Reeves and Lady L. danced all of them very agreeably.</P>
<P>The Earl took me out: But we had hardly done, when, a&s;king pardon for di&s;gracing me, as he too mo|de&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; he and all but my cou&s;ins and Emily, called out for Sir Charles to dance with me.</P>
<P>I was aba&s;hed at the general voice calling upon us both: But it was obeyed.</P>
<P>He de&s;erved all the prai&s;es that Mi&s;s Gran&mdash;Lady G. I would &s;ay, gave him in her Letter to me; and had every one's &s;ilent applau&s;e, while we danced; <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;ilent, that a whi&s;per mu&s;t have been heard. And when he lead me to my &s;eat, every one clapt their hands, as at &s;ome well-performed part, or fine &s;enti|ment, in a play&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me, my dear, this man is every-thing: But his conver&s;ation has ever been among the polite&s;t people of different nations.</P>
<P>Lord W. wi&s;hed him&s;elf able, from his gout, to take out Mi&s;s Jervois. The Bridegroom was called upon by Sir Charles: and he took out the good girl; who danced very prettily. I fan&s;ied, that he cho&s;e to call out Lord G. rather than Mr. Beauchamp. He is the mo&s;t delicate and con&s;iderate of men.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was afterwards called upon by the Bride her&s;elf: And &s;he danced then with a grace indeed! I was plea&s;ed that &s;he <HI>could</HI> perform &s;o well at her own wedding.</P>
<P>Once more he and I were called upon. He, whi&s;|peringly,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
as if all the approbation &s;o loudly given be|fore, when we danced together, was due to me, and none to him&s;elf, condition'd for me, with every one, that no notice &s;hould be taken of my performance: For he &s;aw that I could hardly &s;tand the applau&s;es given on our dancing before.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, when we had done, called me, <HI>inimi|table.</HI> The word was caught by every mouth, and I &s;at down with rea&s;on enough for pride, if their prai&s;es could have elevated me. But I was not proud. My &s;pirits were not high&mdash;I fan&s;y, Lucy, that Lady Cle|mentina is a fine dancer.</P>
<P>Supper was not ready till twelve. Mr. Reeves's coach came about that hour; but we got not away till two. Perhaps the company would not have broke up &s;o &s;oon, had not the Bride been perver&s;e, and re|fu&s;ed to retire. Was &s;he not at home? &s;he a&s;ked Lady L. who was put upon urging her: And &s;hould &s;he leave her company?</P>
<P>She would make me retire with her: She took a very affectionate leave of me.</P>
<P>Marriage, Lucy, is an awful rite. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a joyful &s;olemnity: But on the woman's &s;ide it can be only &s;o, when &s;he is given to the man &s;he loves above all the men in the world; and even to <HI>her,</HI> the anniver&s;ary day, when doubt is turned into certainty, mu&s;t be much happier than the day it&s;elf. What a victim mu&s;t that woman look upon her&s;elf to be, who is com|pelled, or even <HI>over-per&s;uaded,</HI> to give her hand to a man who has no &s;hare in her heart? Ought not a parent or guardian, in &s;uch a circum&s;tance, e&s;pecially if the child has a <HI>delicate,</HI> an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> mind, to be chargeable with all the unhappy con&s;equences that may follow from &s;uch a cruel compul&s;ion?</P>
<P>But this is not the ca&s;e with Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Early &s;he ca&s;t her eye on an improper object. Her pride convinced her in time of the impropriety. And this, as &s;he owns, gave her an difference to all men. She
<PB N="129" REF="130">
hates not Lord G. There is no man whom &s;he prefers to him. And in this re&s;pect, may perhaps, be upon a par with eight women out of twelve, who marry, and yet make not bad wives. As &s;he played with her pa&s;|&s;ion till &s;he lo&s;t it, &s;he may be happy, if &s;he will: And &s;ince &s;he intended to be, &s;ome time or other, Lady, G. her brother was kind in per&s;uading her to &s;horten her days of coquetting and teazing, and allow him to give her to Lord G. before he went abroad.</P>

<P>DR. Bardett was &s;o good as to breakfa&s;t with my cou&s;ins and me this morning. He talks of &s;etting out for Grandi&s;on-hall on Saturday or Mon|day next. We have &s;ettled a corre&s;pondence; and he gives me hope, that he will make me a vi&s;it in North|ampton&s;hire. I know you will all rejoice to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Emily came in before the Doctor went. She brought me the compliments of the Bride, and Lord W. with their earne&s;t reque&s;t, that I would dine with them. Sir Charles was gone, &s;he &s;aid, to make a farewel vi&s;it to the Danby &s;et; but would be at home at dinner.</P>
<P>It would be better for me, I think, Lucy, to avoid all opportunities of &s;eeing him: Don't you think &s;o?&mdash;There is no &s;uch thing as &s;eeing him with indifference&punc; But, &s;o earne&s;tly invited, how could I deny?</P>
<P>My cou&s;ins were al&s;o invited: But having engaged to be at home in the afternoon, they excu&s;ed them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois whi&s;pered me at parting. I never be|fore, &s;aid &s;he, had an opportunity to ob&s;erve the be|haviour of a new-married couple to each other: But is it cu&s;tomary, madam, for the Bride to be more &s;nappi&s;h, as the Bridegroom is more obliging?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
Lady G. is very naughty, my dear, if &s;he &s;o be|haves, as to give you rea&s;on to a&s;k this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>She does: And upon my word, I &s;ee more <HI>obedience</HI> where it was not promi&s;ed, than where it was. Dear madam, is not what is &s;aid at church to be thought of <HI>afterwards?</HI> But why did not the doctor make her &s;peak out? What &s;ignified bowing, except a woman was &s;o ba&s;hful that &s;he <HI>could</HI> not &s;peak?</P>
<P>The bowing, my dear, is an a&s;&s;ent. It is as effi|cacious as words. Lord <HI>G.</HI> only bowed, you know. Could <HI>you</HI> like to be called upon, Emily, to &s;peak out?</P>
<P>Why, no. But then I would be very civil and good|natured to my hu&s;band, if it were but for fear he &s;hould be cro&s;s to me: But I &s;hould think it my duty as well&mdash;Sweet innocent!</P>
<P>She went away, and left the doctor with me.</P>
<P>When our hearts are &s;et upon a particular &s;ubject, how impertinent, how much be&s;ide the purpo&s;e, do we think every other! I wanted the doctor to talk of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: But as he fell not into the &s;ubject, and as I was afraid he would think me to be always leading him into it, if I began it, I &s;uffered him to go away at his fir&s;t motion: I never knew him &s;o &s;hy upon it, however.</P>
<P>Sir Charles returned to dinner. He has told Lady L. who afterwards told us, that he had a hint from Mr. Galhard, &s;enior, that if he were not engaged in his affections, he was commi&s;&s;ioned to make him a very great propo&s;al in behalf of one of the young la|dies he had &s;een the Thur&s;day before; and that from her father.</P>
<P>Surely, Lucy, we may pronounce without doubt, that we live in an age in which there is a great dearth of good men, that &s;o many offers &s;all to the lot of one. But, I am thinking, 'tis no &s;mall advantage to Sir Charles, that his time is &s;o taken up, that he can|not &s;tay long enough in any company to &s;uffer them
<PB N="131" REF="132">
to ca&s;t their eyes on other objects, with di&s;tinction. He left the numerous a&s;&s;embly at Enfield, while they were in the height of their admiration of him. At|tention, love, admiration, cannot be always kept at the &s;tretch. You will ob&s;erve, Lucy, that on the re|turn of a long-ab&s;ent dear friend, the <HI>rapture</HI> la&s;ts not more than an hour: Gladdened, as the heart is, the friend received, and the friend: receiving, perhaps in le&s;s' than that time, can &s;it down quietly together, to hear and to tell &s;tories, of what has happened to either in the ong-regretted ab&s;ence. It will be &s;o with us. Lucy, when I return to the arms of <HI>my</HI> kind friends: And now, does not Sir Charles's propo&s;ed journey to Italy endear his company to us?</P>
<P>The Earl of G. Lady Gertrude, and two agreeable nieces of that Nobleman's, were here at dinner. La|dy G. behaved <HI>pretty</HI> well to her Lord before them: But I, who under&s;tood the language of her eyes, <HI>&s;aw</HI> them talk very &s;aucily to him, on &s;everal occa&s;ions. My Lord is a little officious in his obligingne&s;s; which takes off from that graceful, and polite franke&s;s, which &s;o charmingly, on all occa&s;ions, di&s;tingui&s;hes one happy man, who was then pre&s;ent. Lord G. will perhaps appear more to advantage in that per&s;on's ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp was al&s;o pre&s;ent. He is indeed an agreeable, a mode&s;t young man. He appeared to great advantage, as well in his conver&s;ation, as by his behaviour: And not the le&s;s for &s;ub&s;cribing in both to the &s;uperiority of his friend; who neverthele&s;s endea|voured to dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> him out, as the fir&s;t man.</P>
<P>After dinner, Lady L. Lady G. and I, found an opportunity to be by our&s;elves for one half-hour. Lady G. a&s;ked Lady L. what &s;he intended to do with the thou&s;and poun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> with which Lord W. had &s;o ge|nerou&s;ly pre&s;ented her?&mdash;Do with it, my dear!&mdash;What do you think I <HI>in'end</HI> to do with it?&mdash;It is already di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">
I'll be hanged, &s;aid Lady G. if this good creature has not given it to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Indeed, Charlotte, I have. I gave it to him before I &s;lept.</P>
<P>I thought &s;o! She laughed&mdash;And Lord L. took it? Did he?</P>
<P>To be &s;ure he did. I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been di&s;plea&s;ed with him.</P>
<P>Dear, good &s;oul!&mdash;And &s;o you gave him a thou|&s;and pounds to take part of it back from him, by four or five paltry guineas at a time, at his plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Lord L. and I, Charlotte, have but one pur&s;e. You may perhaps, know how we manage it.</P>
<P>Pray, good, meek, dependent creature! how <HI>do</HI> you manage it?</P>
<P>Thus, Charlotte: My Lord knows that his wife and he have but one intere&s;t; and from the fir&s;t of our happy marriage, he would make me take one key, as he has another, of the private drawer, where his mo|ney and money-bills lie. There is a little memoran|dum-book in the drawer, in which he enters on one page, the money he receives; on the oppo&s;ite, the money he takes out: And when I want money, I have recour&s;e to my key. If I &s;ee but little in the draw|er, I am the more moderate; or, perhaps, if my want is not urgent, defer the &s;upplying of it till my Lord is richer: But little, or much, I minute down the &s;um, as he him&s;elf does; and &s;o we know what we are about; and I never put it out of my Lord's power, by my un&s;ea&s;onable expences, to pre&s;erve that cu&s;tom of his for which he is as much re&s;pected, as well &s;er|ved; not to &s;uffer a demand to be twice made upon him where he is a debtor.</P>
<P>Good &s;oul!&mdash;And, pray, don't you minute down too the <HI>u&s;e</HI> to which you put the money you take out?</P>
<P>Indeed I often do: Always indeed, when I take out more than five guineas at one time: I found my Lord did &s;o; and I followed the example of my own accord.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">
Happy pair! &s;aid I&mdash;O Lady G. what a charming example is this!&mdash;I hope you'll follow it.</P>
<P>Thank you, Harriet, for your advice. Why, I can't but &s;ay, that this is one pretty way of coaxing each other into frugality: But don't you think&punc; that where an hone&s;t pair are &s;o <HI>tender</HI> of di&s;obliging, and &s;o <HI>&s;tudious</HI> of obliging each other, that they &s;eem to con|fe&s;s that the matrimonial good under&s;tanding hangs by very &s;lender threads?</P>
<P>And do not the tendere&s;t friend&s;hips, &s;aid I, hang by <HI>as</HI> &s;lender? Can delicate minds be united to each other but by delicate ob&s;ervances?</P>
<P>Why <HI>thou</HI> art a good &s;oul, too, Harriet!&mdash;And &s;o you would both have me make a pre&s;ent to Lord G. of my thou&s;and pounds before we have cho&s;en our private drawer; before he has got two keys made to it?</P>
<P>Let him know, Charlotte, what Lord L. and I do, if you think the example worth following&mdash;And then&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, and <HI>then</HI> give him my thou&s;and pounds for a beginning, Lady L.?&mdash;But &s;ee you not that this propo|&s;al &s;hould come from <HI>him,</HI> not from <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;And &s;hould we not let each other &s;ee a little of each other's merits, fir&s;t?</P>
<P>See, fir&s;t, the merits of the man you have married, Charlotte!</P>
<P>Yes, Lady L.&mdash;But ye&s;terday married, you know. Can there be a greater difference between any two men in the world, than there often is between the &s;ame man, a lover, and an hu&s;tand?&mdash;And now, my generous advi&s;ers, be plea&s;ed to continue &s;ilent. You cannot an&s;wer me fairly. And be&s;ides, wot ye not the indelicacy of an <HI>early</HI> pre&s;ent, which you are not <HI>obliged</HI> to make?</P>
<P>We were both &s;ilent, each expecting the other to an&s;wer the &s;trange creature.</P>
<P>She laughed at us both. Soft &s;ouls, and tender!
<PB N="134" REF="135">
&s;aid &s;he, let me tell you, that there is more in delicacy, than you <HI>very</HI> delicate people are aware of.</P>
<P>You, Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L. have odder notions than any body el&s;e. Had you been a man, you would have been a &s;ad rake.</P>
<P>A rake perhaps I might have been; but not a <HI>&s;ad</HI> one, Lady L.</P>
<P>Lady G. can't help being witty, &s;aid I: It is &s;ome|times <HI>her</HI> misfortune, &s;ometimes <HI>ours,</HI> that &s;he can|not: However, I highly approve of the example &s;et by Lord L. and followed by Lady L.</P>
<P>And &s;o do I, Harriet. And when Lord G. &s;ets the example, I &s;hall&mdash;con&s;ider of it. I am not a bad oeconomi&s;t. Had I <HI>ten</HI> thou&s;and pounds in my hands, I would not be extravagant: Had I but one hundred, I would not be mean. I value not money but as it enables me to lay an obligation, in&s;tead of being un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving one. I am my mother's daughter, and brother's &s;i&s;ter; and <HI>yours,</HI> Lady L. in this particular; and <HI>yours</HI> too, Harriet: Different means may be taken to arrive at the &s;ame end. Lord G. will have no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with my pru|dence in money-matters, altho' I &s;hould not make him one of my be&s;t courte&s;ies, as if&mdash;as if&mdash;(and &s;he laughed; but checking her&s;elf) I were con&s;cious&mdash;again &s;he laughed&mdash;that I had &s;igned and &s;ealed to my ab&s;olute dependence on his bounty.</P>
<P>What a mad creature! &s;aid Lady L.: But, my Har|riet, don't you think that &s;he behaved pretty well to Lord G. at table?</P>
<P>Yes, an&s;wered I, as tho&s;e would think who ob&s;erve not her arch looks: But &s;he gave me pain for her &s;e|veral times; and I believe her brother was not without his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>He had his eyes upon you, Harriet, reply'd Lady G. more earne&s;tly than he had upon me, or any-body el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
That's true, &s;aid Lady L. I looked upon both him and you, my dear, with pity. My tears were ready to &s;tart more than once&punc; to reflect how happy you two might be in each other, and how greatly you would love each other, were it not&mdash;</P>
<P>Not one word more on this &s;ubject, dear Lady L.! I cannot bear it. I thought my-<HI>&s;elf,</HI> that he often ca&s;t an eye of tenderne&s;s upon me. I cannot bear it. I am afraid of my&s;elf; of my <HI>ju&s;tice</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>His tender looks did not e&s;cape me, &s;aid Lady G. Nor yet did my dear Harriet's. But we will not touch this &s;tring: It is too tender a one. I, for my part, was forced, in order to divert my&s;elf, to turn my eyes on Lord G.: He got nothing by that. The mo&s;t <HI>officious</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Lady G. interupted I, you &s;hall not change the di&s;cour&s;e at the expence of the man you have vowed to honour. I will be pained my&s;elf, by the continuation of the former &s;ubject, rather than that &s;hall be.</P>
<P>Charming Harriet! &s;aid Lady L. I hope your gene|ro&s;ity will be rewarded. Yet tell me, my dear, can you wi&s;h Lady Clementina may be his? I have no doubt but you wi&s;h her <HI>recovery;</HI> but can you wi&s;h her to be <HI>his?</HI></P>
<P>I have debated the matter, my dear Lady L. with my&s;elf. I am &s;orry it has <HI>admitted</HI> of debate: So ex|cellent a creature! Such an honour to her Sex! So nobly &s;incere! So pious!&mdash;But I will confe&s;s the truth: I have called upon <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to &s;upport me in my deter|mination: I have &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>my&s;elf</HI> in <HI>her</HI> &s;ituation, her unhappy malady excepted: I have &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>her</HI> in <HI>mine:</HI> And ought I then to have he&s;itated to which to give the preference?&mdash;Yet&mdash;</P>
<P>What yet, mo&s;t frank, and mo&s;t generous of wo|men, &s;aid Lady L. cla&s;ping her arms about me; what yet&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, yet&mdash;Ah Ladies&mdash;Why, yet, I have many a

pang; many a twitch, as I may call it!&mdash;Why is your brother &s;o tender-hearted, &s;o mode&s;t, &s;o faultle&s;s!&mdash;Why did he not in&s;ult me with his pity! Why does he on every occa&s;ion &s;hew a tenderne&s;s for me, that is more affecting than pity! and why does he give me a con&s;equence that exalts, while it depre&s;&s;es me?</P>
<P>I turned my head a&s;ide to hide my emotion&mdash;Lady G. &s;natched my handkerchief from me; and wiped away a &s;tarting tear; and called me by very tender names.</P>
<P>Am I dear, continued I, to the heart of &s;uch a man? You think I am: Allow me to &s;ay, that he is indeed dear to mine: Yet I have not a wi&s;h but for his hap|pine&s;s, whatever becomes of me.</P>
<P>Emily appeared at the door&mdash;May I come in, La|dies?&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> come in!&mdash;My dear Mi&s;s Byron affect|ed! My dear Mi&s;s Byron in tears!</P>
<P>Her pity, without knowing the cau&s;e, &s;prung to her eyes. She took my hand in both hers, and re|peatedly ki&s;&s;ed it!&mdash;My guardian a&s;ks for you. O with what tenderne&s;s of voice&mdash;Where is your Mi&s;s Byron, Love?

But you &s;igh, dear Mi&s;s Byron, you &s;igh&mdash;Forgive your prating girl!&mdash;You mu&s;t not be grieved.</P>
<P>I embraced her. Grief, my dear, reaches not my heart at this time. It is the merit of your guardian that affects me.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, madam, for your gratitude to my guardian!</P>
<P>A Clementina and an Harriet! &s;aid Lady L. two women &s;o excellent! What a &s;ate is <HI>his!</HI> How mu&s;t <HI>his</HI> heart be divided!</P>
<P>Divided, &s;ay you, Lady L.! re&s;umed Lady G. The man who loves virtue for virtue's &s;ake, loves it where-ever he finds it: Such a man may <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI>

more virtuous women than one: And if he be of a gentle and beneficent nature, there will be tenderne&s;s in his di&s;tinction to every one, varying only accord|ing to the difference of her circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Let me embrace you, my Charlotte, re&s;umed Lady L. for that thought. Don't let me hear for a month to come, one word from the &s;ame lips, that may be unworthy of it.</P>
<P>You have Lord G. in your head, Lady L.: But never mind us. He mu&s;t now-and-then be made to look about him. I'll take care to keep up my con&s;e|quence with him, never fear: Nor &s;hall he have rea|&s;on to doubt the virtue of his wife.</P>
<P>Virtue, my dear! &s;aid I: What is virtue only?

Complacency, obligingne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Obedience</HI> too, I warrant&mdash;Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my &s;weet Harriet! putting her hand before my mouth, we will behave as well as we can: And that will be very well, if nobody minds us. And now let ns go down to|gether.</P>

<P>WE played at cards la&s;t night till &s;upper-time. When that was over, every one &s;ought to en|gage Sir Charles in di&s;cour&s;e. I will give you &s;ome particulars of our conver&s;ation, as I did of one before.</P>
<P>Lord W. began it with a complaint of the in&s;olence and profligatene&s;s of &s;ervants. What he &s;aid, was only an&s;wered by Sir Charles, with the word <HI>example, example,</HI> my good Lord, repeated.</P>
<P>You, Sir Charles, replied my Lord, may indeed
<PB N="138" REF="139">
in&s;i&s;t upon the force of example; for I cannot but ob|&s;erve, that all tho&s;e of yours, whom I have &s;een, are intitled to regard. They have the looks of men at ea&s;e, and of men grateful for that ea&s;e: They know their duty, and need not a reminding look. A &s;ervant of yours, Sir Charles, looks as if he would one day make a figure as a ma&s;ter. How do you manage it?</P>
<P>Perhaps I have been peculiarly fortunate in worthy &s;ervants. There is nothing in my management de|&s;erving the attention of this company.</P>
<P>I am going to begin the world anew, nephew. Hi|therto, &s;ervants have been a continual plague to me. I mu&s;t know how <HI>you</HI> treat them.</P>
<P>I treat them, my Lord, as nece&s;&s;ary parts of my family. I have no &s;ecrets, the keeping or di&s;clo&s;ing of which might give them &s;elf-importance. I endea|vour to &s;et them no bad example. I am never angry with them but for wilful faults: If there are not ha|bitual, I &s;hame them into amendment by gentle ex|po&s;tulation, and <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI> If they are not capable of a generous &s;hame, and the faults grow habitual, I part with them; but with &s;uch kindne&s;s, as makes their fellow-&s;ervants blame them, and take warning. I am fond of &s;eeking occa&s;ions to prai&s;e them: And even when they mi&s;take, if it be with a good inten|tion, they have my approbation of the <HI>intention,</HI> and my endeavours to &s;et them right as to the <HI>act.</HI> So|briety is an indi&s;pen&s;able qualification for my &s;ervice; and for the re&s;t, if we receive them not quite good, we make them better than they were before. Generally &s;peaking, a ma&s;ter may make a &s;ervant what he plea&s;es. Servants judge by example, rather than pre|cept, and almo&s;t always by their &s;eelings. One thing more permit me to add, I always in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;er|vants being kind and compa&s;&s;ionate to one another. A compa&s;&s;ionate heart cannot habitually be an unju&s;t one. And thus do I make their good-nature contri|bute to my &s;ecurity as well as quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
My Lord was greatly plea&s;ed with what his ne|phew &s;aid.</P>
<P>Upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, Lady G. reflected upon a Lady for <HI>prudery;</HI> and was going on, when Sir Charles, interrupting her, &s;aid, Take care, Lady G.&mdash;You, Ladies, take care; for I am afraid that MODESTY, under this name, will become ignominious, and be bani&s;hed the hearts, at lea&s;t the behaviour and conver|&s;ation, of all tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public re&s;ort.</P>
<P>Talk of places of public re&s;ort! &s;aid Lord L.; It is vexatious to ob&s;erve at &s;uch, how men of real merit are neglected by the fine Ladies of the age, while every di&s;tinction is &s;hewn to fops and foplings.</P>
<P>But, who, my Lord, &s;aid Sir Charles, are tho&s;e women? Are they not generally of a cla&s;s with tho&s;e men? Flippant women love empty men, becau&s;e they cannot reproach them with a &s;uperiority of under|&s;tanding, but keep their &s;olly in countenance. They are afraid of a wi&s;e man: But I would by no means have &s;uch a one turn &s;ool to plea&s;e them: For they will de&s;pi&s;e the wi&s;e man's folly more than the &s;illy man's, and with rea&s;on; becau&s;e being uncharacter|i&s;tic, it mu&s;t &s;it more aukwardly upon him than the others can do.</P>
<P>Yet wi&s;dom it&s;elf, and the true&s;t wi&s;dom, <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, is &s;ometimes thought to &s;it ungrace|fully, when it is uncharacteri&s;tic, not to the man, but to the times. She then named a per&s;on who was branded as an hypocrite, for performing all his duties publicly.</P>
<P>He will be wor&s;e &s;poken of, if he declines doing &s;o, &s;aid Dr. Bartlett. His enemies will <HI>add</HI> the charge of cowardice; and not acquit him of the other.</P>
<P>Lady Gertrude being withdrawn, it was men|tioned as a wonder, that &s;o agreeable a woman, as &s;he mu&s;t have been in her youth, and &s;till was for her years, &s;hould remain &s;ingle. Lord G. &s;aid, that &s;he
<PB N="140" REF="141">
had had many offers: And once, before &s;he was twenty, had like to have &s;tolen a wedding: but her fears, he &s;aid, &s;ince that, had kept her &s;ingle.</P>
<P>The longer, &s;aid Sir Charles, a woman remains unmarried, the more apprehen&s;ive &s;he will be of en|tering into the &s;tate. At <HI>&s;eventeen</HI> or <HI>eighteen</HI> a girl will plunge into it, &s;ometimes without either fear or wit; at <HI>twenty</HI> &s;he will begin to think; at <HI>twenty-four</HI> will weigh and di&s;criminate; at <HI>twenty-eight</HI> will be afraid of venturing; at <HI>thirty</HI> will turn about, and look down the hill &s;he has a&s;cended; and, as occa&s;ions offer, and in&s;tances are given, will &s;ometimes repent, &s;ometimes rejoice, that &s;he has gained that &s;ummit <HI>&s;ola.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, I believe in England many a poor girl goes up the hill with a companion &s;he would little care for, if the &s;tate of a &s;ingle wo|man were not here &s;o peculiarly unprovided and help|le&s;s: For girls of &s;lender fortunes, if they have been genteelly brought up, how can they, when family|connexions are di&s;&s;olved, &s;upport them&s;elves? A man can ri&s;e in a profe&s;&s;ion, and if he acquires wealth in a trade, can get above it, and be re&s;pected. A wo|man is looked upon as demeaning her&s;elf, if &s;he gains a maintenance by her needle, or by dome&s;tic attend|ance on a &s;uperior; and without them where has &s;he a retreat?</P>
<P>You &s;peak, good Mrs. Reeves, &s;aid Sir Charles, as if you would join with Dr. Bartlett and me in wi&s;hing the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of a &s;cheme we have often talked over, tho' the name of it would make many a Lady &s;tart. We want to &s;ee e&s;tabili&s;hed in every county, <HI>Prote&s;tant Nunneries;</HI> in which &s;ingle women of &s;mall or no fortunes might live with all manner of free|dom, under &s;uch regulations as it would be a di&s;grace for a mode&s;t or good woman not to comply with, were &s;he ab&s;olutely on her own hands; and to be al|lowed to quit it whenever they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">
Well, brother, &s;aid Lady G. and why could you not have got all this &s;ettled a fortnight ago (you that can carry every point) and have made poor me a Lady Abbe&s;s?</P>
<P>You are &s;till better provided for, my &s;i&s;ter: But let the Doctor and me proceed with our &s;cheme. The governe&s;&s;es or matrons of the &s;ociety I would have to be women of family, of unblameable characters from infancy, and noted equally for their prudence, good-nature, and gentlene&s;s of manners. The at|tendants, for the &s;lighter &s;ervices, &s;hould be the hope|ful female children of the hone&s;t indu&s;trious poor.</P>
<P>Do you not, Ladies, imagine, &s;aid Dr. Bartlett, that &s;uch a &s;ociety as this, all women of unblemi&s;h'd re|putation, employing them&s;elves as each (con&s;ulting her own genius) at her admi&s;&s;ion, &s;hall undertake to employ her&s;elf, and &s;upported genteelly, &s;ome at more, &s;ome at le&s;s expence to the foundation, according to their circum&s;tances; might become a <HI>national</HI> good; and particularly a &s;eminary for good wives, and the in&s;titution a &s;tand for virtue, in an age given up to luxury, extravagance, and amu&s;ements little le&s;s than riotous?</P>
<P>How could it be &s;upported? &s;aid Lord W.</P>
<P>Many of the per&s;ons, of which each community would con&s;i&s;t, would be, I imagine, replied Sir Charles, no expence to it at all; as numbers of young women, joining their &s;mall fortunes, might be able, in &s;uch a &s;ociety, to maintain them&s;elves genteelly on their own income; tho' each, &s;ingly in the world, would be di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides, liberty might be given for wives, in the ab&s;ence of their hu&s;bands, in this maritime country; and for widows, who, on the deaths of theirs, might wi&s;h to retire from the noi&s;e and hurry of the world, for three, &s;ix, or twelve months, more or le&s;s; to re&s;ide in this well-regulated &s;ociety. And &s;uch per|&s;ons, we may &s;uppo&s;e, would be glad, according to their re&s;pective abilities, to be bene&s;actre&s;&s;es to it.
<PB N="142" REF="143">
No doubt but it would have be&s;ides the countenance of the well-di&s;po&s;ed of both &s;exes; &s;ince every family in Britain, in their connexions and relations, near or di|&s;tant, might be benefited by &s;o reputable and u&s;eful an in&s;titution: To &s;ay nothing of the works of the La|dies in it, the profits of which perhaps will be thought proper to be carried towards the &s;upport of a found|ation that &s;o genteelly &s;upports them. Yet I would have a number of hours in each day, for the encourage|ment of indu&s;try, that &s;hould be called their own; and what was produced in them, to be &s;olely appro|priated to their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>A truly worthy divine, at the appointment of the Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, to direct and animate the devo|tion of &s;uch a &s;ociety, and to guard it from that &s;uper|&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m which &s;oars to wild heights in almo&s;t all Nunneries, would confirm it a ble&s;&s;ing to the kingdom.</P>
<P>I have another &s;cheme, my Lord, proceeded Sir Charles&mdash;An Ho&s;pital for female Penitents; for &s;uch unhappy women, as having been once drawn in, and betrayed by the perfidy of men, find them&s;elves, by the cruelty of the world, and principally by that of their own Sex, unable to recover the path of virtue, when perhaps (convinced of the wickedne&s;s of the men in who&s;e honour they confided) they would wil|lingly make their fir&s;t departure from it the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e, continued he, are the poor creatures who are eminently intitled to our pity, tho' they &s;eldom meet with it. Good-nature, and <HI>Credulity</HI> the child of good nature, are generally, as I have the charity to believe, rather than viciou&s;ne&s;s, the foundation of their crime. Tho&s;e men who pretend they would not be the fir&s;t de&s;troyers of a woman's innocence, look upon the&s;e as fair prize. But, what a wretch is he, who &s;eeing a poor creature expo&s;ed on the &s;ummit of a dangerous precipice, and unable, without an a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing hand, to find her way down, would rather pu&s;h
<PB N="143" REF="144">
her into the gulph below, than convey her down in &s;afety?</P>
<P>Speaking of the force put upon a daughter's incli|nations, in wedlock: Tyranny and ingratitude, &s;aid Sir Charles, from a man beloved, will be more &s;upport|able to a woman of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, than even kindne&s;s from a man &s;he loves not: Shall not parents then, who hope to &s;ee their children happy, avoid compelling them to give their hands to a man who has no &s;hare in their hearts?</P>
<P>But would you allow young Ladies to be their own choo&s;ers, Sir Charles? &s;aid Mr. Reeves.</P>
<P>Daughters, replied he, who are earne&s;t to choo&s;e for them&s;elves, &s;hould be <HI>doubly</HI> careful that prudence ju|&s;tifies their choice. Every widow who marries impru|dently (and very many there are who do) furni&s;hes a &s;trong argument in favour of a parent's authority over a maiden daughter. A de&s;igning man looks out for a woman who has an independent fortune, and has no que&s;tions to a&s;k. He &s;eems <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> of findin indi&s;|cretion and ra&s;hne&s;s in &s;uch a one to befriend him. But ought not &s;he to think her&s;elf affronted, and re|&s;olve to di&s;appoint him?</P>
<P>But how, &s;aid Lady G. &s;hall a young creature be able to judge&mdash;</P>
<P>By his application to <HI>her,</HI> rather than to her natural friends and relations; by his endeavouring to alienate her affections from them; by wi&s;hing her to favour private and clande&s;tine meetings (con&s;cious that his peten&s;ions will not &s;tand di&s;cu&s;&s;ion) by the inequality of his fortune to hers: And has not our excellent Mi&s;s Byron, in the Letters to her Lucy (bowing to me) which &s;he has had the goodne&s;s to allow us to read, helped us to a criterion! <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Men in their addre&s;&s;es to young women, &s;he very happily ob&s;erves, forget not to &s;et forward the advantages by which they are di|&s;tingui&s;hed, whether hereditary or acquired; while Love, Love, is all the cry of him who has no other to boa&s;t of.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
And by that means, &s;aid Lady Gertrude, &s;etting the &s;illy creature at variance with all her friends, he makes her fight his battles for him; and become her&s;elf the cat's paw to help him to the ready-roa&s;ted che&s;nuts.</P>
<P>But, dear brother, &s;aid Lady G. do you think Love is &s;uch a &s;tay'd deliberate pa&s;&s;ion, as to allow a young creature to take time to ponder and weigh all the me|rits of the cau&s;e?</P>
<P>Love at fir&s;t &s;ight, an&s;wered Sir Charles, mu&s;t in|dicate a mind <HI>prepared</HI> for impre&s;&s;ion, and a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and that of the lea&s;t noble kind; &s;ince there could be no opportunity of knowing the <HI>merit</HI> of the object. What woman would have her&s;elf &s;up|po&s;ed capable of &s;uch a <HI>tindery-fit?</HI> In a <HI>man,</HI> it is an indelicate paroxy&s;m: But in a <HI>woman,</HI> who expects protection and in&s;truction from a man, much more &s;o. Love, at fir&s;t, may be only fancy. Such a young Love may be ea&s;ily given up, and ought, to a parent's judg|ment. Nor is the conque&s;t &s;o difficult as &s;ome young creatures think it. One thing, my good Emily, let me &s;ay to <HI>you,</HI> as a rule of &s;ome con&s;equence in the world you are ju&s;t entering into&mdash;Young per&s;ons, on arduous occa&s;ions, e&s;pecially in Love-ca&s;es, &s;hould not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e young per&s;ons; becau&s;e they &s;eldom can dive&s;t them&s;elves of pa&s;&s;ion, partiality or preju|dice; that is, indeed, of <HI>youth;</HI> and forbear to mix their own concerns and bya&s;&s;es with the que&s;tion referred to them. It &s;hould not be put from young friend to young friend, What would <HI>you</HI> do in &s;uch a ca&s;e? but, What <HI>ought</HI> to be done?</P>
<P>How the dear girl blu&s;h'd, and how plea&s;ed &s;he looked, to be particularly addre&s;&s;ed by her guardian!</P>
<P>Lady Gertrude &s;poke of a certain father, who for intere&s;ted views obliged his daughter to marry at fifteen, when &s;he was not only indifferent to the man, but had formed no right notions of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>And are they not unhappy? a&s;k'd Sir Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">
They are, reply'd &s;he.</P>
<P>I knew &s;uch an in&s;tance, returned he. The Lady was hand&s;ome, and had her full &s;hare of vanity. She believed every man who &s;aid civil things to her, was in love with her; and had &s;he been &s;ingle, that he would have made his addre&s;&s;es to her. She &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he might have had this great man, or that, had &s;he not been precipitated: And this brought her to &s;light the man who had, as &s;he concluded, deprived her of better offers. They were unhappy to the end of their lives. Had the Lady lived &s;ingle long enough to find out the difference between compliment and &s;incerity, and that the man who flattered her vanity, meant no more than to take advantage of her folly, &s;he would have thought her&s;elf not unhappy with the very man with whom &s;he was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Lady L. &s;peaking afterwards of a certain nobleman, who is continually railing again&s;t matrimony, and who makes a very indifferent hu&s;band to an obliging wife; I have known more men than one, &s;aid Sir Charles, inveigh again&s;t matrimony, when the invective would have proceeded with a much better grace from their wives lips than from theirs But let us enquire, would this complainer have been, or de&s;erved to be happier in <HI>any</HI> &s;tate than he now is?</P>
<P>A &s;tate of &s;uffering, &s;aid Lady L. had probably humbled the &s;pirits of the poor wives into perfect meek|ne&s;s and patience.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve rightly, replied Sir Charles: And &s;urely a mo&s;t kind di&s;po&s;ition of Providence it is, that adver&s;i|ty, &s;o painful in it&s;elf, &s;hould conduce &s;o peculiarly to the improvement of the human mind. It teaches mo|de&s;ty, humility, and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You &s;peak feelingly, brother, &s;aid Lady L. with a &s;igh. Do you think, Lucy, nobody &s;ighed but &s;he?</P>
<P>I do, &s;aid he. I &s;peak with a &s;en&s;e of gratitude: I am naturally of an imperious &s;pirit: But I have reap|ed advantages, from the early &s;troke of a mother's
<PB N="146" REF="147">
death. Being for years, again&s;t my wi&s;hes, obliged to &s;ubmit to a kind of exile from my native country, which I con&s;idered as a heavy evil, tho' I thought it my duty to acquie&s;ce, I was determined, as much as my capacity would allow, to make my advantage of the compul&s;ion, by qualifying my&s;elf to do credit, rather than di&s;credit, to my father, my friends, and my country. And, let me add, that if I have in any tolerable manner &s;ucceeded, I owe much to the exam|ple and precepts of my dear Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>The doctor blu&s;hed and bowed, and was going to di&s;claim the merit which his patron had a&s;cribed to him; but Sir Charles confirmed it in &s;till &s;tronger terms: You, my dear Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid he, as I have told Mi&s;s Byron, was a &s;econd con&s;cience to me in my earlier youth: Your precepts, your excellent life, your pure manners, your &s;weetne&s;s of temper, could not but open and enlarge my mind. The &s;oil, I hope I may &s;ay, was not barren; but you, my dear paternal friend, was the cultivator: I &s;hall ever acknowlege it&mdash;And he bowed to the good man; who was covered with mode&s;t confu&s;ion, and could not look up.</P>
<P>And think you, Lucy, that this acknowlegement le&s;|&s;ened the excellent man with any one pre&s;ent? No! It rai&s;ed him in every eye: And I was the more plea|&s;ed with it, as it helped me to account for that deep ob&s;ervation, which otherwi&s;e one &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to account for, in &s;o young a man. And yet I am convinced, that there is hardly a greater difference in intellect between angel and man, than there is be|tween man and man.</P>

<P>I SEND you inclo&s;ed a Letter I received this morning from Lady G.: I will &s;uppo&s;e you have read it.</P>
<P>Emily &s;ays, that the meeting between Sir Charles and the Lady mentioned in it, was very polite on both &s;ides: But more cold on his, than on hers. She made &s;ome difficulty, however, of dining at his hou&s;e; and her aunt, Lady Ma&s;&s;ei, more. But on Sir Charles's telling them, that he would bring his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to at|tend them thither, they complied.</P>
<P>When I went to St. James's Square, Sir Charles and Lady L were gone in his coach to bring the two La|dies.</P>
<P>Lady G. met me on the &s;tairs-head, leading into her dre&s;&s;ing-room. Not a word, &s;aid &s;he, of the man's &s;ullens: He repents: A fine figure, as I told him, of a bridegroom, would he make in the eyes of foreign Ladies, at dinner, were he to retain his gloomy airs. He has begged my pardon; as good as promi&s;ed amend|ment; and I have forgiven him.</P>
<P>Poor Lord G.! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h! He is within: He will hear you: And then perhaps repent of his repentance.</P>
<P>She led me in: My Lord had a glow in his cheeks, and looked as if he had been nettled; and was but ju&s;t recovering a &s;mile, to help to carry off the petu|lance. O how &s;aucily did her eyes look! Well, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, I hope&mdash;But you &s;ay, I mi&s;under|&s;tood&mdash;</P>

<P>She humorou&s;ly courte&s;ied to him as he bowed to me, taking the compliment as to her&s;elf. She nodded her head to him, as he turned back his when he was at the door; and when he was gone, If I can but make this man orderly, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall not quarrel with my brother for hurrving me, as he has done.</P>
<P>You are wrong, exce&s;&s;ively wrong, Charlotte: You call my Lord a &s;illy man, but can have no proof that he is &s;o, but by his bearing this treatment from you.</P>
<P>None of your grave airs, my dear. The man is a good &s;ort of man, and will be &s;o&punc; if you and Lady L. don't &s;poil him. I have a va&s;t deal of roguery, but no ill-nature, in my heart. There is luxury in je&s;ting with a &s;olemn man, who wants to a&s;&s;ume airs of privi|lege, and thinks he has a right to be impertinent. I'll tell you how I will manage&mdash;I believe I &s;hall often try his patience, and when I am con&s;cious that I have gone too far, I will be patient if he is angry with me; &s;o we &s;hall be quits. Then I'll begin again: He will re&s;ent: And if I find his a&s;pect very &s;olemn&mdash;Come, come, no glouting, friend, I will &s;ay, and perhaps &s;mile in his face: I'll play you a tune, or &s;ing you a &s;ong&mdash;Which, which! Speak in a moment, or the hu|mour will be off.</P>
<P>If he was ready to cry before, he will laugh then, tho' again&s;t his will: And as he admires my finger, and my voice, &s;hall we not be in&s;tantly friends?</P>
<P>It &s;ignified nothing to rave at her: She will have her way. Poor Lord G.!&mdash;At my fir&s;t knowlege of her, I thought her very lively; but imagined not that &s;he was indi&s;creetly &s;o.</P>
<P>Lord G.'s fondne&s;s for his &s;aucy bride was, as I have rea&s;on to believe, his fault: I dare not to a&s;k for par|ticulars of their quarrel: And if I had, and found it &s;o, could not, with &s;uch a raillying creature, have en|tered into his defence or cen&s;ured her.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">
I went down a few moments before her. Lord G. whi&s;pered me, that he &s;hould be the happie&s;t man in the world, if I, who had &s;uch an influence over her, would &s;tand his friend.</P>
<P>I hope, my Lord, &s;aid I, that you will not want any influence but your own. She has a thou&s;and good qualities. She has charming &s;pirits. You will have nothing to bear with but from them. They will not la&s;t always. Think only, that &s;he can mean nothing by the exertion of them, but innocent gaiety; and &s;he will every day love your Lord&s;hip the better for bear|ing with her. You know &s;he is generous and noble.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, madam, &s;aid &s;he, &s;he has let you into&mdash;</P>
<P>She has not acquainted me with the particulars of the little mi&s;under&s;tanding; only has &s;aid, that there had been a &s;light one, which was quite made up.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed, replied he, to have it thought by Mi&s;s Byron, that there <HI>could</HI> have been a mi&s;under&s;tand|ing between us, e&s;pecially &s;o early. She knows her power over me. I am afraid, &s;he de&s;pi&s;es me.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord: Have you not ob&s;erved, that &s;he &s;pares nobody when &s;he is in a lively humour?</P>
<P>True&mdash;But here &s;he comes!&mdash;Not a word, ma|dam!&mdash;I bowed a&s;&s;enting &s;ilence. Lord G. &s;aid &s;he, approaching him, in a low voice, I &s;hall be jealous of your conver&s;ations with Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Would to heaven, my deare&s;t life, &s;natching at her withdrawn hand, that&mdash;</P>
<P>I were half as good as Mi&s;s Byron: I under&s;tand you:&mdash;But time and patience, Sir; nodding to him, and pa&s;&s;ing him.</P>
<P>Admirable creature! &s;aid he, how I adore her!</P>
<P>I hinted to her afterwards, his fear of her de&s;pi&s;ing him. Harriet, an&s;wered &s;he, with a &s;erious air, I will do my duty by him. I will abhor my own heart, if I ever find in it the &s;hadow of a regard for any man in the World, incon&s;i&s;tent with that which he has a right to expect from me.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
I was plea&s;ed with her. And found an opportunity to communicate what &s;he &s;aid, in confidence, to my Lord; and had his ble&s;&s;ings for it.</P>
<P>But now for &s;ome account of Lady Olivia. With which I will begin a new Letter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXI.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Charles returned with the Ladies. He pre&s;ented to Lady Olivia and her Aunt, Lady G. Lord L. and Lord W. I was in another apartment talking with Dr. Bartlett. Lady Olivia a&s;ked for the doctor. He left <HI>me</HI> to pay his re&s;pects to <HI>her.</HI> Sir Charles being informed, that I was in the hou&s;e, told Lady Olivia, that he hoped he &s;hould have the honour of pre&s;enting to her one of our Engli&s;h beauties; de&s;iring Lady G. to reque&s;t my company.</P>
<P>Lady G. came to me&mdash;A lovely woman, I a&s;&s;ure you, Harriet; let me lead you to her. Sir Charles met me at the entrance of the drawing-room: Ex|cu&s;e me, madam, &s;aid he, taking my hand, with pro|found re&s;pect, and allow me to introduce to a very ami|able Italian Lady one of the lovelie&s;t women in Bri|tain; leading me up to her; &s;he advancing towards me. Mi&s;s Byron, madam, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, &s;alutes you. Her beauty engages every eye; but that is her lea&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>Her face glowed. Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid &s;he, in French is all loveline&s;s. A relation, Sir? in Italian. He bowed? but an&s;wered not her que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Her aunt, &s;aluting me, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in my fa|vour.</P>
<P>I would &s;ooner forgive you <HI>here,</HI> whi&s;pered Lady Olivia to Sir Charles, in Italian, looking at me, than at Bologna.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">
I heard her; and by my confu&s;ion &s;hewed that I under&s;tood her. She was in confu&s;ion too.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, in French, under&s;tands Italian&mdash;I am a&s;hamed Mon&s;ieur.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron does, an&s;wered Sir Charles; and French too.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have the honour, &s;aid &s;he in French, to be better known to you, Mademoi&s;elle.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered her as politely as I could in the &s;ame language.</P>
<P>Lady OLIVIA is really a lovely woman. Her com|plexion is fine. Her face oval. Every feature of it is delicate. Her hair is black; and, I think, I never &s;aw brighter black eyes in my life: If po&s;&s;ible, they are brighter, and &s;hine with a more piercing lu&s;tre, than even Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's: But yet I give his the preference; for we &s;ee in them a benignity, that hers, tho' a woman's, have not; and a thoughtfulne&s;s, as if &s;omething lay upon his mind, which nothing but patience could overcome; yet mingled with an air that &s;hews him to be equal to any-thing, that can be undertaken by man. While Olivia's eves &s;hew more fire and impetuo&s;ity than &s;weetne&s;s. Had I not been <HI>toll</HI> it, I &s;hould have been &s;ure that &s;he has a violent &s;pirit: But on the whole, &s;he is a very fine figure of a woman.</P>
<P>She talk'd of taking a hou&s;e, and &s;taying in England a year at lea&s;t; and was determined, &s;he &s;aid, to per|fect her&s;elf in the language, and to become an Engli&s;h|woman: But when Sir Charles, in the way of di&s;|cour&s;e, mentioned his obligation to leave England, as on next Saturday morning, how did &s;he and her aunt look upon each other! And how was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> that gilded her fine countenance, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">! Surely, Sir, &s;aid her aunt, you are not in earne&s;t&punc;</P>
<P>After dinner, the two Ladies retired with Sir Charles, at his motion. Dr. Bartlett, at Lady G.'s reque&s;t, then gave us this &s;hort &s;ketch of her hi&s;tory: He &s;aid,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
She had a va&s;t fortune: She had had indi&s;cretions; but none that had affected her character as to virtue: But her &s;pirit could not bear controul. She had &s;hewn her&s;elf to be vindictive, even to a criminal degree. Lord ble&s;s me, my dear, the doctor has mentioned to me in confidence, that &s;he always carries a poniard about her; and that once &s;he u&s;ed it. Had the per|&s;on died, &s;he would have been called to public account for it. The man, it &s;eems, was of rank, and offer|ed &s;ome &s;light affront to her. She now comes over, the doctor &s;aid, as he had rea&s;on to believe, with a re|&s;olution to &s;acrifice even her religion, if it were in&s;i&s;|ted upon, to the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had &s;o long in vain endea|voured to conquer.</P>
<P>She has, he &s;ays, an utter hatred to Lady Clemen|tina; and will not be able to govern her pa&s;&s;ion, he is &s;ure, when Sir Charles &s;hall acquaint her, that he is going to attend that Lady, and her family: For he has only mentioned his obligation to go abroad; but not &s;aid whither.</P>
<P>Lord W. prai&s;ed the per&s;on of the Lady, and her maje&s;tic air. Lord L. and Lord G. wi&s;h'd to be with|in hearing of the conference between her and Sir Charles: So did Lady G.: And while they were thus wi&s;hing, in came Sir Charles, his face all in a glow; Lady L. &s;aid he, be &s;o good as to attend Lady Olivia.</P>
<P>She went to her. Sir Charles &s;taid not with us: Yet went not to the Lady; but into his Study. Dr. Bartlett attended him there: The doctor returned &s;oon after to us. His noble heart is vexed, &s;aid he: Lady Olivia has greatly di&s;turbed him: He choo&s;es to be alone.</P>
<P>Lady L. afterwards told us, that &s;he found the Lady in violent angui&s;h of &s;pirit; her aunt endeavouring to calm her: She, however, politely addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Lady L. and, begging her aunt to withdraw for a few moments, &s;he owned to her, in French her pa&s;|&s;ion for her brother: She was not, &s;he &s;aid, a&s;hamed
<PB N="155" REF="156">
to own it to his &s;i&s;ter, who mu&s;t know that his merit would dignify the pa&s;&s;ion of the noble&s;t woman. She had endeavoured, &s;he &s;aid, to conquer hers: She had been willing to give way to the prior attachments that he had pleaded for a Lady of her own country Sig|nora Clementina della Porretta, whom &s;he allowed to have had great merit; but who, having irrecoverably been put out of her right mind, was &s;hut up at Na|ples by a brother, who vowed eternal enmity to Sir Charles; and from whom his life would be in the ut|mo&s;t hazard, if he went over. She owned, that her chief motive for coming to England was, to ca&s;t her fortune at her brother's feet; and as &s;he knew him to be a man of honour, to comply with any terms he &s;hould propo&s;e to her. He had offered to the fa|mily della Porretta to allow their daughter her religi|on, and her confe&s;&s;or, and to live with her every other year in Italy. She her&s;elf, not inferior in birth, in per&s;on, in mind&punc; as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he pre&s;umed&punc; and &s;upe|rior in fortune, the riches of three branches of her fa|mily, all rich, having centred in <HI>her,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted not now upon &s;uch conditions. Her aunt, &s;he &s;aid, knew not that &s;he propo&s;ed, on conviction, a change of her re|ligion; but &s;he was re&s;olved not to conceal any-thing from Lady L. She left her to judge how much &s;he mu&s;t be affected, when he declared his obligation to leave England; and e&s;peciall when he owned, that it was to go to Bologna, and that &s;o &s;uddenly, as if, as &s;he apprehended at fir&s;t, it was to avoid <HI>her.</HI> She had been in tears, &s;he &s;aid, and even would have kneeled to him, to induce him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> end his journey for one month and then to have taken her over with him, and &s;een her &s;afe in her own palace. if he <HI>would</HI> go upon &s;o hated, and &s;o fruitle&s;s, as well as &s;o ha|zardous an errand: But he had denied her this poor favour.</P>
<P>This refu&s;al, &s;he owned, had put her out of all patience. She was unhappily pa&s;&s;ionate; but was the
<PB N="156" REF="157">
mo&s;t placable of her Sex. What, madam, &s;aid &s;he, can affect a woman, if &s;light, indignity, and repul&s;e, from a favoured per&s;on, is not able to do it? A woman of my condition to come over to England, to &s;ollicit&mdash;how can I &s;upport the thought&mdash;and to be refu&s;ed the protection of the man &s;he prefers to all men; and her reque&s;t to &s;ee her &s;afe back again, tho' but as the fool &s;he came over&mdash;You may blame me, madam&mdash;but you mu&s;t pity me, even were you to have a heart the &s;i&s;ter-heart of your inflexible bro|ther's.</P>
<P>In vain did Lady L. plead to her Lady Clementina's deplorable &s;ituation; the reluctance of his own rela|tions to part with him; and the magnanimity of his &s;elf-denial in an hundred in&s;tances, on the bare po&s;&s;i|bility of being an in&s;trument to re&s;tore her: She could not bear to hear her &s;peak highly of the unhappy Lady. She charged Clementina with the pride of her family, to which &s;he attributed their de&s;erved cala|mity <HI>[De&s;erved!</HI> Cruel Lady! How could her piti|le&s;s heart allow her lips to utter &s;uch a word!]; and imputed meanne&s;s to the noble&s;t of human minds, for yielding to the entreaties of a family, &s;ome of the principals of which, &s;he &s;aid, had treated him with an arrogance that a man of his &s;pirit ought not to bear.</P>
<P>Lady Maffei came in. She &s;eems dependent upon her niece. She is her aunt by marriage only: And Lady L. &s;peaks very favourably of her from the ad|vice &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, and her remon&s;trances to her kin&s;wo|man. Lady Maffei be&s;ought her to compo&s;e her&s;elf, and return to the company.</P>
<P>She could not bear, &s;he &s;aid, to return to the com|pany, the &s;lighted, the contemned object, &s;he mu&s;t appear to be to every one in it. I am an intruder, &s;aid &s;he, haughtily; a beggar with a fortune that would purcha&s;e a Sovereignty in &s;ome countries. Make my excu&s;es to your &s;i&s;ter, to the re&s;t of the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
company&mdash;and to that fine young Lady&mdash;who&s;e eyes, by their officious withdrawing from his, and by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that glowed in her face whenever he ad|dre&s;&s;ed her, betrayed, at lea&s;t to a jealous eye, more than &s;he would wi&s;h to have &s;een&mdash;But tell her, that all lovely and blooming as &s;he is, &s;he mu&s;t have no hope, while Clementina lives.</P>
<P>I hope, Lucy, it is <HI>only</HI> to a jealous eye that my <HI>heart</HI> is &s;o di&s;coverable!&mdash;I thank her for her caution. But I can &s;ay what &s;he cannot; that from my heart, co&s;t me what it may, I do &s;ub&s;cribe to a preference in favour of a Lady who has acted, in the mo&s;t arduous trials, in a greater manner than I fear either Olivia or I could have acted, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. We &s;ee that her rea&s;on, but not her piety, de&s;erted her in the noble &s;truggle between her Love and her Religion. In the mo&s;t affecting ab&s;ences of her rea&s;on the Soul of the man &s;he loved was the object of her pa&s;&s;ion. However hard it is to prefer another to one's &s;elf, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this; yet if my judgment is convinced, my acknowlegement &s;hall follow it. Heaven will en|able me to be reconciled to the event, becau&s;e I pur|&s;ue the dictates of that judgment, again&s;t the bia&s;&s;es of my more partial heart. Let that Heaven, which only <HI>can,</HI> re&s;tore Clementina, and di&s;po&s;e as it plea&s;es of Olivia and Harriet. We cannot either of us, I humbly hope, be &s;o unhappy as the Lady has been whom I rank among the fir&s;t of women; and who&s;e whole family de&s;erves almo&s;t equal compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia a&s;k Lady L. If her brother had not a very tender regard for me? He had, Lady L. an&s;wer|ed; and told her, that he had re&s;cued me from a very great di&s;tre&s;s; and that mine was the mo&s;t grateful of human hearts.</P>
<P>She called me &s;weet young creature (&s;uppo&s;ing me, I doubt not, youger than I am); but &s;aid, that the graces of my per&s;on and mind alarmed her not, as they would have done, had not his attachment to Cle|mentina
<PB N="158" REF="159">
mentina been what now &s;he &s;aw, but never could have believed it was; having &s;uppo&s;ed, that compa&s;&s;ion only was the tie that bound him to her.</P>
<P>But compa&s;&s;ion, Lucy, from &s;uch a heart as his, the merit &s;o great in the Lady, mu&s;t be Love; a Love of the nobler kind&mdash;And if it were <HI>not,</HI> it would be un|worthy of Clementina's.</P>
<P>Lady Maffei called upon her dignity, her birth, to carry her above a pa&s;&s;ion that met not with a grateful return. She advi&s;ed her to di&s;po&s;e her&s;elf to &s;tay in England &s;ome months, now &s;he was here. And as her friends in Italy would &s;uppo&s;e what her view was in coming to England, their cen&s;ures would be obvi|ated by here continuing here for &s;ome time, while Sir Charles was abroad, and in Italy: And that &s;he &s;hould divert her&s;elf with vi&s;iting the court, the public places, and in &s;eeing the principal curio&s;ities of this kingdom as &s;he had done tho&s;e of others; in order to give cre|dit to an excur&s;ion that might otherwi&s;e be freely &s;poken of, in her own country.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to li&s;ten to this advice. She be&s;poke, and was promi&s;ed, the friend&s;hip of the two &s;i&s;ters; and included in her reque&s;t, through their intere&s;ts, mine; and Lady G. was called in, by her &s;i&s;ter, to join in the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired that Sir Charles might be reque&s;ted to walk in; but would not &s;uffer the &s;i&s;ters to withdraw as they would have done, when he returned. He could not but be polite; but, it &s;eems, looked &s;till di&s;turbed. I beg you to excu&s;e, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, my behaviour to you: It was pa&s;&s;ionate; it was unbecoming. But, in compliment to your own con&s;equence, you <HI>ought</HI> to excu&s;e it. I have only to reque&s;t one favour of you: That you will &s;u&s;pend for <HI>one</HI> week, in regard to me, your propo&s;ed journey; <HI>but</HI> for one week; and I will, now I am in England, &s;tay &s;ome months; perhaps till your return.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, madam.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
I will <HI>not</HI> excu&s;e you&mdash;But <HI>one</HI> week, Sir. Give me &s;o much importance with my&s;elf, as for one week's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. You <HI>will.</HI> You <HI>mu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I cannot. My Soul, I own to you, is in the di&s;tre&s;tes of the family of Porretta. Why &s;hould I repeat what I &s;aid to you before?</P>
<P>I have be&s;poken, Sir, the civilities of your &s;i&s;ters, of your family: You forbid them not?</P>
<P>You expect not an an&s;wer, madam, to that que&s;|tion. My &s;i&s;ters will be glad, and &s;o will their Lords, to attend you where-ever you plea&s;e, with a hope to make England agreeable to you.</P>
<P>How long do you propo&s;e to &s;tay in Italy, Sir?</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to determine.</P>
<P>Are you not apprehen&s;ive of danger to your per&s;on?</P>
<P>I am not.</P>
<P>You ought to be.</P>
<P>No danger &s;hall deter me from doing what I think to be right. If my motives ju&s;tify me, I cannot fear.</P>
<P>Do you wi&s;h me, Sir, to &s;tay in England till your return?</P>
<P>A que&s;tion &s;o home put, di&s;turbed him. Was it a prudent one in the Lady? It mu&s;t either &s;ubject her to a repul&s;e; or him, by a polite an&s;wer, to give her hope, that her &s;tay in England might not be fruitle&s;s, as to the view &s;he had in coming. He reddened. It is fit, an&s;wered he, that your own plea&s;ure &s;hould de|termine you. It did, pardon me, madam, in your journey hither.</P>
<P>She reddened to her very ears. Your brother, La|dies, has the reputation of being a polite man: Bear witne&s;s to this in&s;tance of it. I am a&s;hamed of my|&s;elf!</P>
<P>If I am unpolite, madam, my &s;incerity will be my excu&s;e; at lea&s;t to my own heart.</P>
<P>O that inflexible heart! But, Ladies, if the in|ho&s;pitable Engli&s;hman refu&s;e his protection in his own
<PB N="160" REF="161">
country, to a foreign woman, of no mean quality; Do not you, his &s;i&s;ters, de&s;pi&s;e her.</P>
<P>They, madam, and their Lords, will render you every chearful &s;ervice. Let me reque&s;t you, my &s;i&s;|ters, to make England as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible to this Lady. She is of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration in her own country: She will be of &s;uch where-ever &s;he goes. My Lady Maffei de&s;erves likewi&s;e your utmo&s;t re&s;pect. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to them; Ladies, &s;aid he, en|courage my &s;i&s;ters: They will think them&s;elves ho|noured by your commands.</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters confirmed, in an obliging manner, what their brother had &s;aid; and both Ladies acknow|leged them&s;elves indebted to them for their offered friend&s;hip: But Lady Olivia &s;eemed not at all &s;atisfied with her brother: And it was with &s;ome difficulty he prevailed on her to return to the company, and drink coffee.</P>
<P>I could not help reflecting, on occa&s;ion of this Lady's conduct, that fathers and mothers are great ble&s;&s;ings, to <HI>daughters,</HI> in particular, even when women grown. It is not every woman that will &s;hine in a &s;tate of in|dependency. Great fortunes are &s;nares. If indepen|dent women e&s;cape the machinations of men, which they have often a difficulty to do, they will frequent|ly be hurried by their own imaginations, which are &s;aid to be livelier than tho&s;e of men, tho' their judgments are &s;uppo&s;ed le&s;s, into inconveniencies. Had Lady Olivia's parents or uncles lived, &s;he hardly would have been permitted to make the tour of Europe: And not having &s;o great a fortune to &s;upport vagaries, would have &s;hone, as &s;he is well qualified to do, in a dependent &s;tate, in Italy, and made &s;ome worthy man and her&s;elf haappy.</P>
<P>Had &s;he a mind great enough to induce her to pity Clementina, I &s;hould have been apt to pity <HI>her;</HI> for I &s;aw her &s;oul was di&s;turbed. I &s;aw that the man &s;he loved was not able to return her Love: A pitiable
<PB N="161" REF="162">
ca&s;e! I &s;aw a &s;tarting tear now-and-then with difficulty di&s;perted. Once &s;he rubbed her eye, and, being con|&s;cious of ob&s;ervation, &s;aid &s;omething had got into it: So it had. The &s;omething was a tear. Yet &s;he looked with haughtine&s;s, and her be&s;om &s;welled with indignation ill concealed.</P>
<P>Sir Charles repeated his recommendation of her to Lord L. and Lord G. They offered their be&s;t &s;er|vices: Lord W. invited her and all of us to Wind&s;or. Different parties of plea&s;ure were talked of: But &s;till the Enlivener of every party was not to be in any one of them. She tried to look plea&s;ed; but did not al|ways &s;ucceed in the trial: An eye of Love and Anger mingled was often ca&s;t upon the man whom every-bo|dy loved. Her bo&s;om heaved, as it &s;eemed &s;ometimes, with indignation again&s;t her&s;elf: That was the con&s;truc|tion which I made of &s;ome of her looks.</P>
<P>Lady Maffei, however, &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the par|ties of plea&s;ure talked of: She often directed her&s;elf to me in Italian. I an&s;wered her in it as well as I could. I do not talk it well: But as I am not an Italian, and little more than book-learned in it (for it is a long time ago &s;ince I lo&s;t my grandpappa, who u&s;ed to con|ver&s;e with me in it, and in French) I was not &s;crupu|lous to an&s;wer in it. To have forborne, becau&s;e I did not excel in what I had no opportunity to excel in, would have been fal&s;e mode&s;ty, nearly bordering upon pride. Were any Lady to laugh at me for not &s;peak|ing well <HI>her</HI> native tongue, I would <HI>not</HI> return the &s;mile, were &s;he to be le&s;s perfect in mine, than I am in hers. But Lady Olivia made me a compliment on my faul|ty accent, when I acknowleged it to be &s;o. Signora, &s;aid &s;he, you &s;hew us, that a pretty mouth can give beauty to a defect. A <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> teaching you, added &s;he, would perhaps find &s;ome fault; but a <HI>friend</HI> con|ver&s;ing with you, mu&s;t be in love with you for the very imperfection.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was generou&s;ly plea&s;ed with the compli|ment, and made her a fine one on her ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">
He attended the two Ladies to their lodgings in his coach. He owned to Dr. Bartlett, that Lady Olivia was in tears all the way, lamenting her di&s;grace in com|ing to England, ju&s;t as he was quitting it; and wi&s;h|ing &s;he had &s;tay'd at Florence. She would have engag|ed him to corre&s;pond with her: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf. It was a very afflicting thing to him, he told the doc|tor, to deny any reque&s;t that was made to him, e&s;pe|cially by a Lady: But he thought he ought in con|&s;cience and honour to forbear giving the &s;hadow of an expectation that might be improved into hope, where none was intended to be given. Heaven, he &s;aid, had, for laudable ends, implanted &s;uch a regard in the Sexes towards each other, that both man and woman who hoped to be innocent, could not be too circum&s;pect in relation to the friend&s;hips they were &s;o ready to con|tract with each other. He thought he had gone a great way, in recommending an intimacy between her and his &s;i&s;ters, con&s;idering her views, her &s;pirit, her pre&s;ervance, and the free avowal of her regard for him, and her menaces on his &s;uppo&s;ed neglect of her. And yet, as &s;he <HI>had</HI> come over, and he was obliged to leave England &s;o &s;oon after her arrival; he thought he could not do le&s;s: And he hoped his &s;i&s;ters, from who&s;e examples &s;he might be benefited, would, while &s;he behaved prudently, cultivate her acquain|tance.</P>
<P>The doctor tells me, that now Lady Olivia is &s;o unexpectedly come hither in per&s;on, he thinks it be&s;t to decline giving me, as he had once intended, her hi&s;tory at large; but will leave &s;o much of it as may &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, to be gathered from my own ob|&s;ervation; and not only from the violence and haughti|ne&s;s of her temper, but from the freedom of her de|clarations. He is &s;ure, he &s;aid, that his patron will be be&s;t plea&s;ed, that a veil &s;hould be thrown over the weaker part of her conduct; which, were it known, would indeed be glorious to Sir Charles, but not &s;o to
<PB N="163" REF="164">
the Lady; who, however, never was &s;u&s;pected, even by her enemies, of giving any other man rea&s;on to tax her with a thought that was not &s;trictly virtuous: And &s;he had engaged his Piety and E&s;teem, for the &s;ake of her other fine qualities, tho' &s;he could not his Love. Before &s;he &s;aw him (which, it &s;eems, was at the opera at Florence for the fir&s;t time, when he had an oppor|tunity to pay her &s;ome &s;light civilities) &s;he &s;et all men at defiance.</P>
<P>To-morrow morning Sir Charles is to breakfa&s;t with <HI>me.</HI> My cou&s;ins and I are to dine at Lord L's. The Earl and Lady Gertrude are al&s;o to be there. Lord W. has been prevailed upon to &s;tay, and be there al&s;o, as it is his nephew's la&s;t day in England.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'La&s;t day in England!'</Q> O my Lucy! What words are tho&s;e!&mdash;Lady L. has invited Lady Olivia and her aunt, at her own motion, Sir Charles (his time being &s;o &s;hort) not di&s;approving.</P>

<P>NOT five hours in bed; not one hour's re&s;t, for many unea&s;y nights before. I was &s;tupid till Sir Charles came: I then was better. He enquired, with tender looks and voice, after my health; as if he thought I did not look well.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome talk about Lord and Lady G. He was anxious for their happine&s;s. He complimented me with hopes from my advice to her. Lord G. he &s;aid, was a good-natured hone&s;t man. If he thought his &s;i&s;ter would make him unhappy, he &s;hould him&s;elf be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
I told him, that I dared to an&s;wer for her heart. My Lord mu&s;t bear with &s;ome innocent foibles, and all would be well.</P>
<P>We then talked of Lady Olivia. <HI>He</HI> began the &s;ub|ject, by a&s;king me my opinion of her. I &s;aid &s;he was a very fine woman in her per&s;on; and that &s;he had an air of grandeur in her mien.</P>
<P>And &s;he has good qualities, &s;aid he; but &s;he is vio|lent in her pa&s;&s;ions. I am frequently grieved for her. She is a fine creature in danger of being lo&s;t, by being made too &s;oon her own mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;aid not one word of his departure to-morrow morning: I could nor begin it; my heart would not let me; my &s;pirits were not high: And I am afraid, if that key had been touched, I &s;hould have been too vi&s;ibly affected. My cou&s;ins forbore, upon the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was exce&s;&s;ively tender and &s;oothing to me, in his air, his voice, his manner. I thought of what Emily &s;aid; that his voice, when he &s;poke of me, was the voice of Love. Dear flattering girl!&mdash;But <HI>why</HI> did &s;he flatter me?</P>
<P>We talked of <HI>her</HI> next. He &s;poke of her with the tenderne&s;s of a father. He be&s;ought me to love her. He prai&s;ed her heart.</P>
<P>Emily, &s;aid I, venerates her guardian. She never will do any-thing contrary to his advice.</P>
<P>She is very young, replied he. She will be happy, madam, in yours. She both loves and reverences you.</P>
<P>I greatly love the dear Emily, Sir. She and I &s;hall be always &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>How happy am I, in your goodne&s;s to her! Permit me, madam, to enumerate to you my own felicities in that of my deare&s;t friends.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp is now in the agreeable &s;ituation I have long wi&s;hed him to be in. His prudence and obliging behaviour to his mother-in-law, have won
<PB N="165" REF="166">
her. His father grants him every-thing thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gh her; and &s;he, by this means, finds that power enlarged which &s;he was afraid would be le&s;&s;ened, it the &s; n were allowed to come over. How ju&s;t is this reward of his filial duty!</P>
<P>Thus, Lucy, did he give up the merit to his Beau|champ, which was &s;olely due to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord W. he hoped, would be &s;oon one of the hap|pie&s;t men in England: And the whole Mansfield fami|ly had now fair pro&s;pects opening before them.</P>
<P>Emily [Not <HI>be,</HI> you &s;ee] had made it the intere&s;t of her mother to be quiet.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. gave him plea&s;ure whenever he &s;aw them, or thought of them.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett was in Heaven while on earth. He would retire to his beloved Grandi&s;on-hall, and employ him&s;elf in di&s;tributing, as objects offered, at lea&s;t a thou&s;and pounds of the three thou&s;and bequeathed to charitable u&s;es by his late friend Mr. Danby. His &s;i&s;|ter's fortune was paid. His e&s;tates in both kingdoms were improving&mdash;See, madam, &s;aid he, how like the friend of my Soul I claim your attention to affairs that are of con&s;equence to my&s;elf; and in &s;ome of which your genero&s;ity of heart has intere&s;ted you.</P>
<P>I bowed. Had I &s;poken, I had bur&s;t into tears. I had &s;omething aro&s;e in my throat, I know not what. Still, thought I, excellent man, you are not your&s;elf happy!&mdash;O pity! pity! Yet, Lucy, he plainly had been enumerating all the&s;e things, to take off from my mind that impre&s;&s;ion which I am afraid he too well knows it is affected with, from his difficult &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>And now, madam, re&s;umed he, how are all my dear and good friends, whom you more particularly call yours?&mdash;I hope to have the honour of a per&s;onal knowlege of them. When heard you from our good Mr. Deane? He is well, I hope.</P>
<P>Very well, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
Your grandmamma Shirley, that ornament of ad|vanced years?</P>
<P>I bowed: I dared not tru&s;t to my voice.</P>
<P>Your excellent aunt Selby?</P>
<P>I bowed again.</P>
<P>Your uncle, your Lucy, your Nancy: Happy fa|mily! All harmony! all love!&mdash;How do they?</P>
<P>I wiped my eyes.</P>
<P>Is there any &s;ervice in my power to do them, or any of them? Command me, good Mi&s;s Byron, if there be: My Lord W. and I are one. Our Influence is not &s;mall.&mdash;Make me &s;till <HI>more</HI> happy, in the power of &s;erving any one favoured by you.</P>
<P>You oppre&s;s me, Sir, by your goodne&s;s!&mdash;I can|not &s;peak my grateful &s;en&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>Will you, my dear Mr. Reeves, Will you, madam, (to my cou&s;in) employ me in any way that I can be of u&s;e to you, either abroad or at home? Your ac|quaintance has given me great plea&s;ure. To what a family of worthies has this excellent young Lady in|troduced me!</P>
<P>O Sir! &s;aid Mrs Reeves, tears running down her cheeks, that you were not to leave people whom you have made &s;o happy in the knowlege of the be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>Indi&s;pen&s;able calls mu&s;t be obeyed, my dear Mrs. Reeves. If we cannot be as happy as we wi&s;h, we will rejoice in the happine&s;s we <HI>can</HI> have. We mu&s;t not be our own carvers.&mdash;But I make you all &s;erious. I was enumerating, as I told you, my pre&s;ent felicities: I was rejoicing in your friend&s;hips. I <HI>have</HI> joy; and, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, I <HI>will</HI> have joy. There is a bright &s;ide in every event; I will not lo&s;e &s;ight of it: And there is a dark one; but I will endeavour to &s;ee it only with the eye of prudence, that I may not be involved by it at unawares. Who that is not reproached by his own heart, and is ble&s;&s;ed with health, can grieve for inevitable evils; evils that can be only evils as we
<PB N="167" REF="168">
make them &s;o? Forgive my &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s: My dear friends, you <HI>make</HI> me grave. Favour me, I be&s;eech you, my good Mi&s;s Byron, with one le&s;&s;on: We &s;hall be too much engaged, perhaps, by-and-by.</P>
<P>He led me (I thought it was with a <HI>chearful</HI> air; but my cou&s;ins both &s;ay, his eyes gli&s;tened) to the harp&s;i|chord: He &s;ung una&s;ked, but with a low voice; and my mind was calmed. O Lucy! How can I part with &s;uch a man? How can I take my leave of him?&mdash;But perhaps he has taken his leave of me already, as to the &s;olemnity of it, in the manner I have recited.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday Morning, Apr. <HI>15.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O Lucy, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is gone! Gone in|deed! He &s;at out at three this morning; on pur|po&s;e, no doubt, to &s;pare his &s;i&s;ters, and the two bro|thers-in-law, and Lord W. as well as him&s;elf, concern. We broke not up till after two. Were I in the writ|ing humour which I have never known to fail me till now, I could dwell upon an hundred things, &s;ome of which I can now only briefly mention.</P>
<P>Dinner-time ye&s;terday pa&s;&s;ed with tolerable chear|fulne&s;s: Every one <HI>tried</HI> to be chearful. O what pain attends loving too well, and being too well beloved! He mu&s;t have pain, as well as we.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia was the mo&s;t thoughtful, at dinner|time; yet p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r Emily! Ah the poor Emily! &s;he went out four or five times to weep; tho' only I per|ceived it.</P>
<P>Nobody was chearful after dinner but Sir Charles. He &s;eemed to exert him&s;elf to be &s;o. He prevailed on me to give them a le&s;&s;on on the harp&s;ichord. Lady L. played: Lady G. played: We <HI>tried</HI> to play, I &s;hould rather &s;ay. He him&s;elf took the violin, and
<PB N="168" REF="169">
afterwards &s;at down to the harp&s;ichord, for one &s;hort le&s;&s;on. He was not known to be &s;uch a ma&s;ter: But he was long in Italy. Lady Olivia indeed knew him to be &s;o. She was induced to play upon the harp&s;i|chord: She &s;urpa&s;&s;ed every-body. Italy is the land of harmony.</P>
<P>About &s;even at night he &s;ingled me out, and &s;ur|pri&s;ed me greatly by what he &s;aid. He told me, that Lady D. had made him a vi&s;it. I was before low: I was then ready to &s;ink. She has a&s;ked me que&s;tions, madam.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir! was all I could &s;ay.</P>
<P>He him&s;elf trembled as he &s;poke&mdash;Alas! my dear, he &s;urely loves me! Hear how &s;olemnly he &s;poke&mdash;God Almighty be your director, my dear Mi&s;s Byron! I wi&s;h not more happine&s;s to my own Soul, than I do to you.&mdash;In di&s;charge of a promi&s;e made, I mention this vi&s;it to you: I might otherwi&s;e have &s;pared you, and my&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt there&mdash;Then re&s;umed; for I was &s;ilent&mdash;I could not &s;peak&mdash;Your friends will be entreated for a man that loves you; a very worthy young nobleman.&mdash;I give you emotion, madam.&mdash;Forgive me.&mdash;I have performed my promi&s;e. He turned from me with a &s;eeming chearful air. How <HI>could</HI> he appear to be chearful!</P>
<P>We made parties at cards. I knew not what I play|ed. Emily &s;ighed, and tears &s;tole down her cheeks, as &s;he played. O how &s;he loves her guardian! Emily, I &s;ay&mdash;I don't know what I write!</P>
<P>At &s;upper we were all very melancholy. Mr. Beau|champ was urgent to go abroad with him. He chang|ed the &s;ubject, and gave him an <HI>indirect</HI> denial, as I may call it, by recommending the two Italian Ladies to his be&s;t &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, kind, good, excellent! wi&s;hed to Lord L. to have &s;een Mr. Grandi&s;on!&mdash;Unworthy as that man has made him&s;elf of his attention.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
He was a few moments in private with Lady Oli|via. She returned to company with red eyes.</P>
<P>Poor Emily watched an opportunity to be &s;poken to by him alone&mdash;So diligently! He led her to the window&mdash;About one o' clock it was&mdash;He held both her hands. He called her, &s;he &s;ays, <HI>his</HI> Emily. He charged her to write to him.</P>
<P>She could not &s;peak; &s;he could only &s;ob; yet thought &s;he had a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>He contradicted not the hope his &s;i&s;ters and their Lords had of his breakfa&s;ting with them. They in|vited me; they invited the Italian Ladies: Lady L. Lord L. did go, in expectation: But Lady G. when &s;he found him gone, &s;ent me and the Italian Ladies word, that he was. It would have been cruel, if &s;he had not. How <HI>could</HI> he &s;teal away &s;o! I find, that he intended that his morning vi&s;it to me (as indeed I half &s;u&s;pected) &s;hould be a taking leave of my cou&s;ins, and your Harriet. How many things did he &s;ay then&mdash;How many que&s;tions a&s;k&mdash;In tender woe&mdash;He want|ed to do us all &s;ervice&mdash;He &s;eemed not to know what to &s;ay&mdash;Surely he hates not your poor Harriet&mdash;What &s;truggles in his noble bo&s;om!&mdash;But a man can|not complain: A man cannot a&s;k for compa&s;&s;ion, as a woman can. But &s;urely his is the gentle&s;t of man|ly minds!</P>
<P>When we broke up, he handed my cou&s;in Reeves into her coach. He handed me. Mr. Reeves &s;aid, We &s;ee you again, Sir Charles, in the morning? He bowed. At handing me in, he &s;ighed&mdash;He pre&s;&s;ed my hand&mdash;I think he did&mdash;That was all&mdash;He &s;aluted nobody.&mdash;He will not meet his Clementina as he parted with us.</P>
<P>But, I doubt not, Dr. Bartlet was in the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>He was. He has ju&s;t been here. He found my eyes &s;welled. I had had no re&s;t; yet knew not, till &s;even o'clock, that he was gone.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
It was very good of the doctor to come: His vi&s;it &s;oothed me: Yet he took no notice of my red eyes. Nay, for that matter, Mrs. Reeves's eyes were &s;well|ed, as well as mine. Angel of a man! How is he beloved!</P>
<P>The doctor &s;ays, that his Si&s;ters, their Lords, Lord W. are in as much grief as if he were departed for ever&mdash;And who knows&mdash;But I will not torment my &s;elf with &s;uppo&s;ing the wor&s;t: I will endeavour to bear in mind what he &s;aid ye&s;terday morning to us, no doubt for an in&s;truction, that he <HI>would</HI> have joy.</P>
<P>And did he then think that I &s;hould be &s;o much grieved as to want &s;uch an in&s;truction?&mdash;And there|fore did he vouch&s;afe to give it?&mdash;But, vanity, be quiet&mdash;Lie down, hope&mdash;Hopele&s;ne&s;s, take place!&mdash;Clementina &s;hall be his. He &s;hall be hers.</P>
<P>Yet his emotion, Lucy, at mentioning Lady D.'s vi&s;it&mdash;O! but that was only owing to his humanity. He &s;aw <HI>my</HI> emotion; and acknowleged the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip for me! Ought I not to be &s;atisfied with that? I <HI>am.</HI> I <HI>will be</HI> &s;atisfied. Does he not love me with the love of mind? The poor Olivia has not this to comfort her&s;elf with. The poor Olivia! If I &s;ee her &s;ad and afflicted, how I &s;hall pity her! All her ex|pectations fru&s;trated; the expectations that engaged her to combat difficulties, to travel, to cro&s;s many waters, and to come to England&mdash;to come ju&s;t time enough to take leave of him; he ha&s;tening on the wings of Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to a dearer, a <HI>de&s;erv|edly</HI> dearer object, in the country &s;he had quitted, on purpo&s;e to vi&s;it him in his&mdash;Is not hers a more griev|ous &s;ituation than mine?&mdash;It is. Why, then, do I lament.?</P>
<P>But here, Lucy, let me in confidence hint, what I have gathered from &s;everal intimations from Dr. Bart|lett, tho' as tenderly made by him as po&s;&s;ible, that had Sir Charles Grandi&s;on been a man capable of taking advantage of the violence of a Lady's pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="171" REF="172">
for him, the unhappy Olivia would not have &s;crupled, great, haughty, and noble as &s;he is, by birth and for|tune, to have been his, without conditions, if &s;he could not have been &s;o with: The Italian world is of this opinion, at lea&s;t. Had Sir Charles been a Rinaldo, Olivia had been an Armida.</P>
<P>O that I could hope, for the honour of the Sex, and of the Lady who is &s;o fine a woman, that the Italian world is mi&s;taken!&mdash;I will pre&s;ume that it is.</P>
<P>My good Dr. Bartlett, will you allow me to accu&s;e you of a virtue too rigorous? That is &s;ometimes the fault of very good people. You own that Sir Charles has not, even to <HI>you,</HI> revealed a &s;ecret &s;o di&s;graceful to her. You own, that he has only blamed her for hav|ing too little regard for her reputation, and for the violence of her temper: Yet how patiently, for one of &s;uch a temper, has &s;he taken his departure, almo&s;t on the day of her arrival! <HI>He</HI> could not have given her an <HI>opportunity</HI> to indicate to him a conce&s;&s;ion &s;o criminal: <HI>She</HI> could not, if he <HI>had,</HI> have made the overture. Wicked, wicked world! I will not believe you! And the le&s;s credit &s;hall you have with me, Italian world, as I have <HI>&s;een</HI> the Lady. The innocent heart will be a charitable one. Lady Olivia is only too intrepid. Pro&s;perity, as Sir Charles ob&s;erved, has been a &s;nare to her, and &s;et her above a proper regard to her reputation.&mdash;Mercile&s;s world! I do not love you. Dear Dr. Bartlett, you are not yet ab&s;olutely perfect! The&s;e hints of yours again&s;t Olivia, gathered from the malevolence of the envious, are proofs (the fir&s;t indeed, that I have ever met with) of your imper|fection.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Lucy: How have I run on! Di&s;ap|pointment has mortified me, and made me good|natured.&mdash;I will welcome adver&s;ity, if it enlarge my charity.</P>
<P>The doctor tells me, that Emily, with her half|broken heart, will be here pre&s;ently. If I can be of
<PB N="172" REF="173">
comfort to her&mdash;But I want it my&s;elf, from the &s;ame cau&s;e. We &s;hall only weep over each other.</P>
<P>As I told you, the doctor, and the doctor only, knew of his &s;etting out &s;o early. He took leave of him. Happy Dr. Bartlett!&mdash;Yet I &s;ee by his eyes, that this parting co&s;t him &s;ome paternal tears.</P>
<P>Never father better loved a &s;on than this good man loves Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, it &s;eems, had &s;ettled all his affairs three days before. His &s;ervants were appointed. Richard Saunders is one of the three he has taken with him. Happy &s;ervants! to be every day in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The doctor tells me, that he had la&s;t week pre|&s;ented the elder Mr. Oldham with a pair of Colours, which he had purcha&s;ed for him. Nobody had heard of this.</P>
<P>Lord W. he &s;ays, is preparing for Wind&s;or; Mr. Beauchamp for Hamp&s;hire, for a few days; and then he returns to attend the commands of the noble Italians. Lady Olivia will &s;oon have her equipage ready. She will make a great appearance. But Sir CHARLES GRANDISON will not be with her. What is gran|deur to a di&s;turbed heart? The Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude are &s;etting out for Hertford&s;hire. Lord and Lady L. talk of retiring, for a few weeks, to Colne|brooke: The Doctor is preparing for Grandi&s;on-hall; your poor Harriet for Northampton&s;hire&mdash;Ble&s;s me, my dear, what a di&s;per&s;ion!&mdash;But Lord W.'s nup|tials will collect &s;ome of them together at Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>EMILY, the dear weeping girl! is ju&s;t come. She is with my cou&s;ins. She expects my permi&s;&s;ion for coming up to me. Imagine us weeping over each other; praying for, ble&s;&s;ing the guardian of us both. Your imagination cannot form a &s;cene too tender. Adieu, my Lucy.</P>

<P>O What a blank, my dear!&mdash;But I need not &s;ay what I was going to &s;ay. Poor Emily!&mdash;But to mention her grief, is to paint my own.</P>
<P>Lord W. went to Wind&s;or Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>A very odd behaviour of Lady Olivia. Mr. Beau|champ went ye&s;terday, and offered to attend her to any of the publick places, at her plea&s;ure; in pur&s;u|ance of Sir Charles's reference to him, to do all in his power to make England agreeable to her: And &s;he thought fit to tell him before her aunt, that &s;he thank|ed him for his civility; but &s;he &s;hould not trouble him during her &s;tay in England. She had <HI>gentlemen</HI> in her train; and one of them had been in England before&mdash;He left her in di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Lady L. making her a vi&s;it in the evening, &s;he told her of Mr. Beauchamp's offer, and of her an&s;wer. The gentleman, &s;aid &s;he, is a polite and very agree|able man; and <HI>this</HI> made me treat his kind offer with abruptne&s;s: For I can hardly doubt your brother's view in it. I <HI>&s;corn</HI> his view: And if I were &s;ure of it, perhaps I &s;hould find a way to make him repent of the Indignity. Lady L. was &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, that nei|ther her brother, nor Mr. Beauchamp, had any other views than to make England as agreeable to her as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, madam, &s;aid &s;he, I have no &s;er|vice for Mr. Beauchamp: But if your Lady&s;hip, your &s;i&s;ter, and your two Lords, will allow me to cultivate your friend&s;hip, you will do me honour. Dr. Bart|lett's company will be very agreeable to me likewi&s;e, as often as he will give it me. To Mi&s;s Jervois I lay &s;ome little claim. I would have had her for my
<PB N="174" REF="175">
companion in Italy; but your cruel brother&mdash;No more, however, of him. Your Engli&s;h beauty too, I admire her: But, poor young creature, I admire her the more, becau&s;e I can pity <HI>her.</HI> I &s;hould think my|&s;elf very happy to be better acquainted with her.</P>
<P>Lady L. made her a very polite an&s;wer for her&s;elf and her &s;i&s;ter, and their Lords: But told her, that I was very &s;oon to &s;et out for my own abode in North|ampton&s;hire; and that Dr. Bartlett had &s;ome com|mi&s;&s;ions, which would oblige him, in a day or two, to go to Sir Charles's &s;eat in the country. She her&s;elf offered to attend her to Wind&s;or, and to every other place, at her command.</P>
<P>LADY L. took notice of her wri&s;t being bound round with a broad black ribband, and a&s;ked, If it were hurt? A kind of &s;prain, &s;aid &s;he. But you little imagine how it came; and mu&s;t not a&s;k.</P>
<P>This made Lady L. curious. And Olivia reque&s;t|ing that Emily might be allowed to breakfa&s;t with her as this morning; &s;he has bid the dear girl endeavour to know how it came, if it fell in her way: For Olivia reddened, and looked up, with a kind of con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, to Lady L. when &s;he told her that &s;he mu&s;t not a&s;k que&s;tions about it.</P>
<P>Lady G. is very earne&s;t with me to give into the town-diver&s;ions for a month to come: But I have now no de&s;ire in my heart &s;o &s;trong, as to throw my|&s;elf at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt; and to be embraced by my Lucy and Nancy, and all my Northampton&s;hire Loves. I am only afraid of my uncle. He will railly his Harriet; yet only, I know, in hopes to divert her, and us all: But my je&s;ting days are over: My &s;ituation will not bear it. Yet if it will divert him&s;elf, let him railly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be &s;o much importuned to &s;tay longer than I ought, or <HI>will</HI> &s;tay, that I may as well fix a per|emptory day at once. Will you, my ever indulgent
<PB N="175" REF="176">
friends, allow me to &s;et out for Selby-hou&s;e on Friday next? Not on a Sunday, as Lady Betty Williams advi&s;es, for fear of the <HI>odious waggons.</HI> But I have been in a different &s;chool. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I find, makes it a <HI>tacit</HI> rule with him, Never to <HI>begin</HI> a journey on a Sunday; nor, except when in pur&s;uit of works of mercy or nece&s;&s;ity, to travel in time of Di|vine Service. And this rule he ob&s;erved la&s;t Sunday, tho' he reached us here in the evening. O my grand|mamma! How much is he, what you all are, and ever have been!&mdash;But he is now pur&s;uing a work of mercy. God &s;ucceed to him the end of his pur&s;uit!</P>
<P>But why <HI>tacit?</HI> you will a&s;k. Is Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on a&s;hamed to make an open appearance in behalf of his Chri&s;tian duties? He is not. For in&s;tance; I have never &s;een him &s;it down at his own table, in the ab&s;ence of Dr. Bartlett, or &s;ome other clergyman, but he him&s;elf &s;ays grace; and that with &s;uch an ea&s;y dignity, as commands every one's reverence; and which is &s;ucceeded by a chearfulne&s;s that looks as if he were the better plea&s;ed for having &s;hewn a thankful heart.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett has al&s;o told me, that he begins and ends every day, either in his Chamber, or in his Study, in a manner worthy of one who is in earne&s;t in his Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. But he never frights gay com|pany with grave maxims. I remember, one day, Mr. Grandi&s;on a&s;ked him, in his ab&s;urd way, Why he did not preach to his Company now-and-then? Faith, Sir Charles, &s;aid he, if you did, you would reform many a poor ignorant &s;inner of us; &s;ince you could do it with more weight, and more certainty of attention, than any par&s;on in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>It would be an affront, &s;aid Sir Charles, to the un|der&s;tanding, as well as education, of a man who took rank above a pea&s;ant, in &s;uch a country as this, to &s;eem to que&s;tion whether he <HI>knew</HI> his general duties, or not, and the nece&s;&s;ity of practi&s;ing what he knew
<PB N="176" REF="177">
of them. If he &s;hould be at a lo&s;s, he <HI>may</HI> once a week be reminded, and his heart kept warm. Let you and me, cou&s;in Everard, &s;hew our conviction by our practice; and not invade the clergyman's pro|vince.</P>
<P>I remember, that Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;hewed his con|viction by his blu&s;hes; and by repeating the three little words, <HI>You and me!</HI> Sir Charles.</P>

<P>O MY dear friends! I have a &s;trange, a &s;hocking piece of intelligence to give you! Emily has ju&s;t been with me in tears: She begged to &s;peak with me in private. When we were alone, &s;he threw her arms about my neck: Ah, madam! &s;aid &s;he, I am come to tell you, that there is a per&s;on in the world that I hate, and mu&s;t and will hate, as long as I live. It is Lady Olivia.&mdash;Take me down with you into Northampton&s;hire, and never let me &s;ee her more.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>O madam! I have found out, that &s;he would, on Thur&s;day la&s;t, have killed my guardian.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed, Lucy.</P>
<P>They retired together, you know, madam: My guardian came from her, his face in a glow; and he &s;ent in his &s;i&s;ter to her, and went not in him&s;elf till afterwards. She would have had him put off his journey. She was enraged becau&s;e he would not; and they were high together; and at la&s;t &s;he pulled out of her &s;tays, in fury, a poniard, and vowed to plunge it into his heart. He &s;hould never, &s;he &s;aid, &s;ee his Clementina more. He went to her. Her heart failed her. Well it might, you know, madam. He &s;eized her hand. He took it from her. She &s;truggled, and in &s;truggling her wri&s;t was hurt; that's the meaning of the broad black ribband!&mdash;Wicked creature! to have &s;uch a thought in her heart!&mdash;He only &s;aid, when he had got it from her, Unhappy, violent woman! I return not this in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="177" REF="178">
of mi&s;chief! You will have no u&s;e for it in England&mdash;And would not let her have it again.</P>
<P>I &s;huddered. O my dear, &s;aid I, he has been a &s;ufferer, we are told, by good women; but this is <HI>not</HI> a good woman. But can it be true? Who informed you of it?</P>
<P>Lady Maffei her&s;elf. She thought that Sir Charles mu&s;t have &s;poken of it: And when &s;he found he had not, &s;he was &s;orry &s;he <HI>had,</HI> and begged I would not tell any-body: But I could not keep it from you. And &s;he &s;ays, that Lady Olivia is grieved on the re|membrance of it; and arraigns her&s;elf, and her wicked pa&s;&s;ion; and the more, for his noble forgivene&s;s of her on the &s;pot, and recommending her afterwards to the civilities of his &s;i&s;ters, and their Lords. But I hate her, for all that.</P>
<P>Poor unhappy Olivia! &s;aid I. But what, my Emily, are we women, who &s;hould be the meeke&s;t and tendere&s;t of the whole animal creation, when we give way to pa&s;&s;ion! But if &s;he is &s;o penitent, let not the &s;hocking attempt be known to his &s;i&s;ters, or their Lords. I may take the liberty of mentioning it, in <HI>&s;trict confidence</HI> [Ob&s;erve that, Lucy] to tho&s;e from whom I keep not any &s;ecret: But let it not be di|vulged to any of the relations of Sir Charles. Their dete&s;tation of her, which mu&s;t follow, would not be concealed; and the unhappy creature, made de&s;perate, might&mdash;Who knows what &s;he might do?</P>
<P>The dear girl ran on upon what might have been the con&s;equence, and what a lo&s;s the world would have had, if the horrid fact had been perpetrated. Lady Maffci told her, however, that had not her heart relented, &s;he might have done him mi&s;chief; for he was too ra&s;h in approaching her. She fell down on her knees to him, as &s;oon as he had wre&s;ted the po|niard from her. I forgive, and pity you, madam, &s;aid he, with an air that had, as Olivia and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> aunt have recollected &s;ince, both maje&s;ty and company a
<PB N="178" REF="179">
in it: But he would withdraw. Yet, at her reque&s;t, &s;ent in Lady L. to her; and, going into his Study, told not even Dr. Bartlett of it, tho' he went to him there immediately.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this violence, perhaps, the Lady was more temperate afterwards, even to the very time of his departure.</P>
<P>LORD ble&s;s me, What &s;hall I do? Lady D. has &s;ent a card to let me know, that &s;he will wait upon Mrs. Reeves and me to-morrow to breakfa&s;t. She comes, no doubt, to tell me, that Sir Charles having no thoughts of Harriet Byron, Lord D. may have hopes of &s;ucceeding with her: And perhaps her Lady|&s;hip will plead Sir Charles's recommendation and in|tere&s;t in Lord D's favour. But &s;hould this plea be made, good Heaven give me patience! I am afraid I &s;hall be uncivil to this excellent woman.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXV.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuatin.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, April <HI>17.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Counte&s;s is ju&s;t gone.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves was engaged before to breakfa&s;t with Lady Betty Williams; and we were only Mrs. Reeves, Lady D. and I.</P>
<P>My heart aked at her entrance; and every moment &s;till more, as we were at breakfa&s;t. Her looks, I thought, had &s;uch particular kindne&s;s and meaning in them, as &s;eemed to expre&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You have no hopes, Mi&s;s Byron, any-where el&s;e; and I will have you to be mine.'</Q></P>
<P>But my &s;u&s;pence was over the moment the tea-table was removed. I &s;ee your confu&s;ion, my dear, &s;aid the Counte&s;s [Mrs. Reeves, you mu&s;t not leave us]; and I have &s;at in pain for you, as I &s;aw it increa&s;e.
<PB N="179" REF="180">
By this I know that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has been as good as his word. Indeed I doubted not but he would. I don't wonder, my dear, that you love him. He is the fine&s;t man in his manners, as well as per&s;on, that I ever &s;aw. A woman of virtue and honour cannot <HI>but</HI> love him. But I need not prai&s;e him to you; nor to <HI>you,</HI> neither, Mrs. Reeves; I &s;ee that.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, proceeded &s;he, that there is an alliance propo&s;ed for my &s;on, of which I think very well; but &s;till &s;hould have thought better, had I never &s;een you, my dear. I have talked to my Lord about it: You know I am very de&s;irous to have him mar|ried. His an&s;wer was; I never can think of any pro|po&s;al of this nature, while I have any hope that I can make my&s;elf acceptable to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>What think you, my Lord, &s;aid I, if I &s;hould di|rectly apply to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, to know his intentions; and whether he has any hopes of obtain|ing her favour? He is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t unre&s;erved of men. He knows our characters to be as unex|ceptionable as his own; and that our alliance cannot be thought a di&s;credit to the fir&s;t family in the king|dom. It is a free que&s;tion, I own; as I am unac|quainted with him by per&s;on: But he is &s;uch a man, that methinks I can take plea&s;ure in addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to him on <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;miled at the freedom of my motion; but not di&s;approving it, I directly went to Sir Charles, and, after due compliments, told him my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;topt. She is very penctrating. She looked at us both.</P>
<P>Well, madam, &s;aid my cou&s;in, with an air of cu|rio&s;ity&mdash;Pray, your Lady&s;hip&mdash;</P>
<P>I could not &s;peak for very impatience&mdash;</P>
<P>I never heard in my life, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, &s;uch a fine character of any mortal, as he gave you. He told me of his engagements to go abroad as the very next day. He highly extolled the Lady for who&s;e
<PB N="180" REF="181">
&s;ake, principally, he was obliged to go abroad; and he &s;poke as highly of a brother of hers, whom he loved as if he were his own brother; and mentioned very affectionately the young Lady's whole family.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'God only knows, &s;aid he, what may be <HI>my</HI> de|&s;tiny!&mdash;As genero&s;ity, as ju&s;tice, or rather as Pro|vidence, leads, I will follow.'</Q></P>
<P>After he had generou&s;ly opened his heart, proceeded the Counte&s;s, I a&s;ked him, if he had any hope, &s;hould the foreign Lady recover her <HI>health,</HI> of her being his?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I can promi&s;e my&s;elf nothing, &s;aid he. I go over without one &s;elfi&s;h hope. If the Lady recover <HI>her</HI> health, and her brother can be amended in <HI>his,</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I &s;hall carry over with me, I &s;hall have joy inexpre&s;&s;ible. To Providence I leave the re&s;t. The re&s;ult cannot be in my <HI>own</HI> power.'</Q></P>
<P>Then, Sir, proceeded the Counte&s;s, you cannot in honour be under any engagements to Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>I aro&s;e from my &s;eat. Whither, my dear?&mdash;I have <HI>done,</HI> if I oppre&s;s you. I moved my chair behind hers, but &s;o clo&s;e to hers, that I leaned on the back of it, my face hid, and my eyes running over. She &s;tood up. Sit down again, madam, &s;aid I, and pro|ceed&mdash;Pray proceed. You have excited my curio|&s;ity. Only let me &s;it here, <HI>unheeded,</HI> behind you.</P>
<P>Pray, madam, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves (burning al&s;o with curio&s;ity, as &s;he has &s;ince owned) go on; and indulge my cou&s;in in her pre&s;ent &s;eat. What an&s;wer did Sir Charles return?</P>
<P>My dear Love, &s;aid the Counte&s;s (&s;itting down, as I had reque&s;ted) let me fir&s;t be an&s;wered one que&s;tion. I would not do mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>You cannot do mi&s;chief, madam, replied I. What is your Lady&s;hip's que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Has Sir Charles Grandi&s;on ever directly made his addre&s;&s;es to you, my dear?</P>
<P>Never, madam.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">
It is not for want of love, I dare aver, that he has not. But thus he an&s;wered my que&s;tion: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf the unworthie&s;t of men, know|ing the difficulties of my own &s;ituation, how great &s;oever were the temptation from Mi&s;s Byron's me|rit, if I had &s;ought to engage her affections'</Q></P>
<P>[O, Lucy! How nobly is his whole conduct to|wards me ju&s;tified!]</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She has, madam (proceeded the Counte&s;s in his words) 'a prudence that I never knew equalled in a woman &s;o young. With a frankne&s;s of mind, to which hardly ever young Lady before her had pre|ten&s;ions, &s;he has &s;uch a command of her affections, that no man, I dare &s;ay, will ever have a &s;hare in them, till he has courted her favour by a&s;&s;iduities which &s;hall convince her that he has no heart but for <HI>her.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>O my Lucy! What an honour to me would the&s;e &s;entiments be, if I de&s;erved them! And <HI>can</HI> Sir Charles Grandi&s;on think I <HI>do?</HI> I hope &s;o. But if he does, how much am I indebted to his favourable, his generous opinion I Who knows but I have rea&s;on to rejoice, rather than to regret, as I u&s;ed to do, his frequent ab&s;ences from Colnebrooke?</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s proceeded.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you will not take it ami&s;s, if my &s;on, by <HI>his</HI> a&s;&s;iduities, can prevail upon Mi&s;s Byron to think that he <HI>has</HI> merit, and that his heart is <HI>wholly</HI> devoted to her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Ami&s;s, madam!&mdash;No!&mdash;In ju&s;tice, in honour, I cannot. May Mi&s;s Byron be, as &s;he de&s;erves to be, one of the happie&s;t women on earth in her nup|tials. I have heard a great character of Lord D. He has a very large e&s;tate. He may boa&s;t of his mother&mdash;God forbid, that <HI>I,</HI> a man <HI>divided in my|&s;elf,</HI> not knowing what I <HI>can</HI> do, hardly &s;ometimes what I <HI>ought</HI> to do, &s;hould &s;eek to involve in my own uncertainties the friend I revere; the woman I
<PB N="182" REF="183">
&s;o greatly admire: Her beauty &s;o attracting; &s;o proper therefore for her to engage a generous pro|tector in the married &s;tate!'</Q></P>
<P>Generous man! thought I. O how my tears ran down my cheeks, as I hid my face behind the Coun|te&s;s's chair!</P>
<P>But will you allow me, Sir, proceeded the Coun|te&s;s, to a&s;k you, Were you freed from all your un|certainties&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Permit me, madam, interrupted he, to &s;pare you the que&s;tion you were going to put. Mi&s;s Byron may come to hear the &s;ub&s;tance of a conver&s;ation that is of a very delicate nature&mdash;As I know not what will be the re&s;ult of my journey abroad, I &s;hould think my&s;elf a very <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> man, and a very di&s;honourable one to <HI>two</HI> Ladies of equal delicacy and worthine&s;s, if I &s;ought to involve, as I hinted before, in my own uncertainties, a young Lady who&s;e prudence and great qualities mu&s;t make her|&s;elf and <HI>any</HI> man happy, whom &s;he &s;hall favour with her hand.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To be &s;till more explicit, proceeded he, With what face could I look up to a woman of honour and delicacy, &s;uch a one as the Lady before whom I now &s;tand, if I could own a wi&s;h, that, while my honour has laid me under obligation to <HI>one Lady,</HI> if &s;he &s;hall be permitted to accept of me, I &s;hould pre&s;ume to hope, that <HI>another,</HI> no le&s;s worthy, would hold her favour for me &s;u&s;pended, till &s;he &s;aw what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t obligation? No, madam; I could &s;ooner die, than offer &s;uch indig|nity to BOTH! <HI>I</HI> am fettered, added he; but Mi&s;s Byron is free: And &s;o is the Lady abroad. My at|tendance on her at this time, is indi&s;pen&s;able; but I make not any conditions for my&s;elf&mdash;My reward will be in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;charged the obligations that I think my&s;elf under, as a man of honour.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
The counte&s;s's voice changed in repeating this &s;peech of his: And &s;he &s;topt to prai&s;e him; and then went on.</P>
<P>You are <HI>THE</HI> man, indeed, Sir!&mdash;But then give me leave to a&s;k you, As I think it very likely that you will be married before you return to England, Whe|ther now that you have been &s;o good as to &s;peak fa|vourably of my &s;on, and that you call Mi&s;s Byron Si&s;ter, you will oblige him with a recommendation to that &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Counte&s;s of D. &s;hews, by this reque&s;t, her value for a young Lady who de&s;erves it; and the <HI>more,</HI> for its being, I think (Excu&s;e me, madam) a pretty extraordinary one. But what a pre&s;umption would it be in me, to &s;uppo&s;e that I had SUCH an intere&s;t with Mi&s;s Byron, when &s;he has relations as worthy of <HI>her,</HI> as &s;he is of <HI>them?</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>You may gue&s;s, my dear, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, that I &s;hould not have put this que&s;tion, but as a trial of his heart. However, I a&s;ked his pardon; and told him, that I would not believe he gave it me, except he would promi&s;e to mention to Mi&s;s Byron, that I had made him a vi&s;it on this &s;ubject [Methinks, Lucy, I &s;hould have been glad that he had not let <HI>me</HI> know that he was &s;o forgiving!].</P>
<P>And now, my dear, &s;aid the Lady, let me turn about.&mdash;She did; and put one arm round my neck, and with my own handkerchief wiped my eyes, and ki&s;&s;ed my cheek; and when &s;he &s;aw me a little reco|vered, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me as follows:</P>
<P>Now, my good young creature, [O that you would let me call you daughter in my own way! for I think I mu&s;t always call you &s;o, whether you do, or not] let me a&s;k you, as if I were your real mother, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Have you any expectation that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on will be yours?'</Q></P>
<P>Dear madam, Is not this as hard a que&s;tion to be put to me, as that which you put to him?</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185">
Yes, my dear&mdash;full as hard. And I am as ready to a&s;k your pardon, as I was his, if you are really di&s;|plea&s;ed with me for putting it. Are you, Mi&s;s By|ron? Excu&s;e me, Mrs. Reeves, for thus urging your lovely cou&s;in: I am at lea&s;t entitled to the excu&s;e Sir Charles Grandi&s;on made for me, that it is a de|mon&s;tration of my value for her.</P>
<P>I have declared, madam, returned I, and it is from my heart, that I think he ought to be the hu&s;band of the Lady abroad: And tho' I prefer him to all the men I ever &s;aw, yet I have re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to conquer the particular regard I have for him. He has in a very noble manner offered me his friend&s;hip; &s;o long as it may be accepted without interfering with any other attachments on my part: And I will be &s;atisfied with that.</P>
<P>A friend&s;hip &s;o pure, replied the Counte&s;s, as that of &s;uch a man, is con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>any other</HI> attach|ments. My Lord D. will, with his whole Soul, con|tribute all in his power to &s;trengthen it: He admires Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: He would think it a double honour to be acquainted with him through you. Deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, take another worthy young man into your friend&s;hip, but with a tenderer name: I &s;hall then claim a fourth place in it for my&s;elf. O my dear! What a quadruple knot will you tie!</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip does me too much honour, was all I could ju&s;t then reply.</P>
<P>I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have an an&s;wer, my dear: I will not take up with a compliment.</P>
<P>This, then, madam, is my an&s;wer&mdash;I hope I am an hone&s;t creature: I have <HI>not</HI> a heart to give.</P>
<P>Then you have expectations, my dear.&mdash;Well, I will call you <HI>mine,</HI> if I <HI>can.</HI> Never did I think that I could have made the propo&s;al, that I am going to make you: But in my eyes, as well as in my Lord's, you are an incomparable young woman.&mdash;This is it&mdash;We will not think of the alliance propo&s;ed to us (It
<PB N="185" REF="186">
is yet <HI>but</HI> a propo&s;al, and to which we have not re|turned any an&s;wer) till we &s;ee what turn the affair Sir Charles is gone upon takes. You once &s;aid, you could prefer my &s;on to any of the men that had hi|therto applied to you for your favour. Your affections to Sir Charles were engaged before you knew us. Will you allow my &s;on this preference, which will be the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> preference, if Sir Charles engages him&s;elf abroad?</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip &s;urpri&s;es me: Shall I not improve by the example you have ju&s;t now &s;et before me? Who was it that &s;aid, and a <HI>man</HI> too? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'With what face could I look up to a woman of honour and de|licacy, &s;uch a one as the Lady before whom I now &s;tand, if I could own a wi&s;h, that, whil'</Q> my heart leaned to one per&s;on, I &s;hould think of keeping an|other in &s;u&s;pence till I &s;aw whether I could or could not be the other's? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'No, madam, I would &s;ooner die,' as Sir Charles &s;aid, 'than offer &s;uch an in|dignity to <HI>both!</HI>'</Q> But I know, madam, that you only made this propo&s;al, as you did another to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, as a <HI>trial of my heart.</HI></P>
<P>Upon my word, my dear, I &s;hould, I think, be glad to be entitled to &s;uch an excu&s;e: But I was really in earne&s;t; and now take a little &s;hame to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>What charming ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in this Lady!</P>
<P>She cla&s;p'd her arms about me, and ki&s;&s;ed my cheek again. I have but one plea to make for my|&s;elf; I could not have fallen into &s;uch an error (the example &s;o recently given to the contrary) had I not wi&s;hed you to be, before any woman in the world, Counte&s;s of D.&mdash;Noble Creature! No title can give you dignity. May your own wi&s;hes be granted!</P>
<P>My cou&s;in's eyes ran over with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s a&s;ked, When I returned to North|hampton&s;hire? I told her my intention. She charged me to &s;ee her fir&s;t. But I can tell you, &s;aid &s;he, my Lord &s;hall not be pre&s;ent when you come: Not once
<PB N="186" REF="187">
more will I tru&s;t him in your company; and if he &s;hould &s;teal a vi&s;it unknown to me, let not your cou&s;in &s;ee him, Mrs. Reeves. He does <HI>indeed</HI> admire you, Love, looking at me.</P>
<P>I acknowleged, with a grateful heart, her goodne&s;s to me. She engaged me to corre&s;pond with her when I got home. Her commands were an honour done me, that I could not refu&s;e my&s;elf. Her &s;on, &s;he &s;milingly told me, &s;hould no more &s;ee my Letters, than my Per&s;on.</P>
<P>At her going away&mdash;I will tell you one thing, &s;aid &s;he: I never before, in a bu&s;ine&s;s which my heart was &s;et upon, was &s;o effectually &s;ilenced by a precedent produced by my&s;elf in the &s;ame conver&s;ation. I came with an a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. When our <HI>hearts</HI> are engaged in a hope, we are apt to think every &s;tep we take for the promoting it, rea&s;onable: Our pa&s;|&s;ions, my dear, will evermore run away with our judgment. But now I think of it, I mu&s;t, when I &s;ay <HI>our,</HI> make two exceptions; one for you, and one for Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>But, Lucy, tell me&mdash;May I, do you think, ex|plain the meaning of the word SELFISH u&s;ed by Sir Charles in the conclu&s;ion of the Library-conference at Colnebrooke (and which puzzled me then to make out) by his di&s;claiming of <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> in the conver&s;ation with the Counte&s;s above recited? If I may, what an open|ing of his heart does that word give in my favour, were he at liberty? Does it not look, my dear, as if hs <HI>Honour</HI> checked him, when his <HI>Love</HI> would have prompted him to wi&s;h me to pre&s;erve my heart di&s;|engaged till his return from abroad? Nor let it be &s;aid, that it was di&s;honourable in him to have &s;uch a thought, as it was <HI>checked</HI> and <HI>overcome;</HI> and as it was &s;ucceeded by &s;uch an emotion, that he was obliged to depart abruptly from me.&mdash;Let me repeat the words&mdash;You may not have my Letter at hand which relates that affecting addre&s;s to me; and it is impo&s;&s;ible for

<P>MY cou&s;ins and I, by invitation, &s;upp'd with Lady G. this afternoon. Lord and Lady L. were there; Lady Olivia al&s;o, and Lady Maffei.</P>
<P>I have &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t them all into a con&s;ternation, as they ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, by my declaration of leaving Lon|don on my return home early on Friday morning next. I knew, that were I to pa&s;s the whole &s;ummer here, I mu&s;t be peremptory at la&s;t. The two &s;i&s;ters vow,
<PB N="188" REF="189">
that I &s;hall not go &s;o &s;oon. They &s;ay, that I have &s;een &s;o few of the town-diver&s;ions&mdash;Town-diver&s;ions, Lucy!&mdash;I have had diver&s;ion enough of one &s;ort!&mdash;But in your arms, my dear friends, I &s;hall have con|&s;olation&mdash;And I want it.</P>
<P>I have great regrets, and &s;hall have hourly more, as the day approaches, on the leaving of &s;uch dear and obliging friends: But I am determined.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in's coach will convey me to Dun&s;table; and there, I know, I &s;hall meet with my indulgent uncle, or your brother. I would not have it publicly known, becau&s;e of the officious gentlemen in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett intended to &s;et out for Grandi&s;on-hall to-morrow: But from the natural kindne&s;s of his heart he has &s;u&s;pended his journey to Thur&s;day next. No con&s;ideration, therefore, &s;hall detain me, if I am well.</P>
<P>My cou&s;ins are grieved: They did not expect that I would be a word and a blow, as they phra&s;e it.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf concerned, that &s;he, in particular, was to lo&s;e me. She had propo&s;ed great plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, in the parties &s;he &s;hould make in my company. But, after what Emily told me, &s;he appears to me as a Medu&s;a; and were I to be thought by her a formidable rival, I might have as much rea&s;on to be afraid of the potion, as the man &s;he loves of the poniard. Emily has kept the &s;ecret from every-body but me. And I rely on the inviolable &s;ecrecy of all you&punc; my friends.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. had de&s;igned to go to Colne|brooke to-morrow, or at my day, having hopes of getting me with them: But now, they &s;ay, they will &s;tay in town till they can &s;ee whether I am to be pre|vailed upon, or will be <HI>obdurate.</HI></P>
<P>Lady Olivia enquired after the di&s;tance of North hampton&s;hire. She will make the tour of England, &s;he &s;ays, and vi&s;it me there. I was obliged to &s;ay I &s;hould take her vi&s;it as an honour.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">
Wicked Politene&s;s! Of how many fal&s;hoods do&s;t thou make the people, who are called <HI>polite,</HI> guilty!</P>
<P>But there is one man in the world, who is remark|able for his truth, yet is unque&s;tionably polite. He cen&s;ures not others for complying with fa&s;hions e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by cu&s;tom; but he gives not in to them. He never perverts the meaning of words. He never, for in&s;tance, &s;uffers his &s;ervants to deny him, when he is at home. If he is bu&s;y, he ju&s;t finds time to &s;ay he is, to unexpected vi&s;iters; and if they will &s;tay, he turns them over to his Si&s;ters, to Dr. Bartlett, to Emily, till he can attend them. But then he has <HI>al|ways</HI> done &s;o. Every one knows that he lives to his own heart, and they <HI>expect</HI> it of him; and when they <HI>can</HI> have his company, they have double joy in the ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s that attend his lei&s;ure: They then have him <HI>wholly.</HI> And he can be the more polite, as the company then is all his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir Charles might the better do &s;o, as he came over &s;o few months ago, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence; and his reputation for politene&s;s was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that people rather looked for rules from him, than a con|formity to theirs.</P>
<P>His denials of complimenting Lady Olivia (tho' &s;he was but ju&s;t arrived in his native country, where &s;he never was before) with the &s;u&s;pending of his departure for one week, or but for one day&mdash;Who but he could have given them? But he was convinced, that it was right to ha&s;ten away, for the &s;ake of Clementina and his Jeronymo; and that it would have been wrong to &s;hew Olivia, even for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, that in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a compeition &s;he had con&s;equence with him; and all her entreaties, all her menaces, the dete&s;ted poniard in her hand, could not &s;hake his &s;teady &s;oul, and make him delay his well-&s;ettled purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>THIS naughty Lady G.&mdash;She is exce&s;&s;ively to blame. Lord L. is out of patience with her. So is Lady L. Emily &s;ays, &s;he loves her dearly; but &s;he does not love her ways. Lord G. as Emily tells me, talks of coming to me; the cau&s;e of quarrel &s;up|po&s;ed to be not great: But trifles, in&s;i&s;ted upon, make frequently the wide&s;t breaches. Whatever it be, it is between them&s;elves; and neither cares to tell: But Lord and Lady L. are angry with her, for the ludi|crous manner in which &s;he treats him.</P>
<P>The mi&s;under&s;tanding happened after my cou&s;in and I left them la&s;t night. I was not in &s;pirits, and declined &s;taying to cards. Lady Olivia and her aunt went away at the &s;ame time. Whi&s;t was the game. Lord and Lady L. Dr. Bartlett and Emily, were ca&s;t in. In the mid&s;t of their play, Lady G. came hurry|ing down &s;tairs to them, warbling an air: Lord G. followed her, much di&s;turbed. Madam, I mu&s;t tell you, &s;aid he&mdash;Why MUST, my Lord? I don't bid you.</P>
<P>Sit &s;till, child, &s;aid &s;he to Emily; and took her &s;eat behind her&mdash;Who wins? Who lo&s;es?</P>
<P>Lord G. walked about the room&mdash;Lord and Lady L. were unwilling to take notice, hoping it would go off; for there had been a few liveline&s;&s;es on her &s;ide at dinner-time, tho' all was &s;erene at &s;upper.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett offered her his cards. She refu&s;ed them.&mdash;No, doctor, &s;aid &s;he, I will play my own cards: I &s;hall have enough to do to play <HI>them</HI> well.</P>
<P>As you manage it, &s;o you will, madam, &s;aid Lord G.</P>
<P>Don't expo&s;e your&s;elf, my Lord: We are before company. Lady L. you have nothing but trumps in your hand.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">
Let me &s;aw a word or two to you, madam, &s;aid Lord G. to her.</P>
<P>I am all obedience, my Lord.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e. He would have taken her hand: She put it behind her.</P>
<P>Not your <HI>hand,</HI> madam?</P>
<P>I can't &s;pare it.</P>
<P>He &s;lung from her, and went out of the room.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, &s;aid &s;he, returning to the card-table with a gay unconcern, What &s;trange pa&s;&s;ionate crea|tures are the&s;e men!</P>
<P>Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L. I <HI>wonder</HI> at you.</P>
<P>Then I give you joy&mdash;</P>
<P>What do you mean, &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;</P>
<P>We women love wonder, and the wonder-ful!</P>
<P>Surely, Lady G. &s;aid Lord L. you are wrong.</P>
<P>I give your Lord&s;hip joy, too.</P>
<P>On what?</P>
<P>That my &s;i&s;ter is always right.</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, were I Lord G. I &s;hould have no patience.</P>
<P>A good hint for you, Lady L. I hope you will take this for a warning, and be good.</P>
<P>When I behave as you do, Charlotte&mdash;</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Lady L. you need not &s;peak out&mdash;Every one in their way.</P>
<P>You would not behave thus, were my brother&mdash;</P>
<P>Perhaps not.</P>
<P>Dear Charlotte, you are exce&s;&s;ively wrong.</P>
<P>So I think, returned &s;he.</P>
<P>Why then do you not&mdash;</P>
<P>Mend, Lady L.? All in good time.</P>
<P>Her woman came in with a me&s;&s;age, expre&s;&s;ing her Lord's de&s;ire to &s;ee her.&mdash;The duce is in the&s;e men! They will neither be &s;atisfied with us, nor with|out us. But I am all obedience: No <HI>vow</HI> will I break&mdash;And out &s;he went.</P>
<P>Lord G. not returning pre&s;ently, and Lord and

Lady L.'s chariot being come, they both took this op|portunity, in order to &s;hew their di&s;plea&s;ure, to go away without taking leave of their &s;i&s;ter. Dr. Bart|lett retired to his apartment. And when Lady G. came down, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed, and a little vexed, to find only Emily there. Lord G. came in at another door&mdash;Upon my word, my Lord, this is &s;trange behaviour in you: You fright away, with your hu&s;|band like airs, all one's company.</P>
<P>Good God!&mdash;I am a&s;toni&s;hed at you, madam.</P>
<P>What <HI>&s;ignifies</HI> your a&s;toni&s;hment?&mdash;When you have &s;cared every-body out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I, madam!</P>
<P>You, Sir! Yes, You!&mdash;Did you not lord it over me in my dre&s;&s;ing-room?&mdash;To be ea&s;y and quiet, Did I not fly to our company in the drawing-room? Did you not follow me there&mdash;with looks&mdash;Very pretty looks for a new-married man, I a&s;&s;ure you! Then did you not want to take me a&s;ide&mdash;Would not any|body have &s;uppo&s;ed it was to expre&s;s your &s;orrow for your odd behaviour? Was I not all obedience?&mdash;Did you not, with very <HI>manni&s;h</HI> airs, &s;light me for my compliance, and fly out of the room? All the com|pany could witne&s;s the calmne&s;s with which I returned to them, that they might not be grieved for me; nor think our mi&s;under&s;tanding a deep one. Well, then, when your &s;tomach came down, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, you &s;ent for me out: No doubt, thought I, to expre&s;s his concern now.&mdash;I was all obedience again.</P>
<P>And did I not be&s;eech you, madam&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Be&s;eech</HI> me, my Lord!&mdash;Yes&mdash;But with &s;uch looks!&mdash;I married, Sir, let me tell you, a man with another face&mdash;See, &s;ee, Emily&mdash;He is gone again.&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord flew out of the room in a rage&mdash;O the&s;e men, my dear! &s;aid &s;he to Emily.</P>
<P>I know, &s;aid Emily, what I could have an&s;wered if I dared: But it is ill meddling, as I have heard &s;ay, between man and wife.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>HARRIET BYRON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In half an hour after, came a &s;ervant from Lady G. with the following Letter:</P>
<P>SO, then, I have made a ble&s;&s;ed hand of wedlock, My brother gone: My man exce&s;&s;ive unruly: Lord and Lady L. on his &s;ide, without enquiring into merits, or demerits: Lectured by Dr. Bartlett's grave face: Emily &s;tanding aloof; her finger in her eye: And now my Harriet renouncing me: And all in one week!</P>
<P>What can I do?&mdash;War &s;eems to be declared: And will you not turn mediatrix?&mdash;You won't, you &s;ay. Let it alone. Neverthele&s;s, I will lay the whole matter before you.</P>
<P>It was la&s;t night, the week from the wedding-day not completed, that Lord G. thought fit to break into my retirement without my leave&mdash;By the way, he was
<PB N="194" REF="195">
a little impertinent at dinner-time; but that I pa&s;&s;ed over.&mdash;</P>
<P>What boldne&s;s is this, &s;aid I!&mdash;Pray, Sir, begone&mdash;Why leave you your company below?</P>
<P>I come, my deare&s;t life, to make a reque&s;t to you.</P>
<P>The man began with civility enough, had he had a little le&s;s of his odious rapture; for he flung his arms about me, Jenny in pre&s;ence. A hu&s;band's fondne&s;s is enough to ruin the&s;e girls. Don't you think, Har|riet, that there is an immorality in it, before them?</P>
<P>I refu&s;e your reque&s;t, be it what it will. How dare you invade me in my retirement?&mdash;You may believe, that I intended not to &s;tay long above, my &s;i&s;ter below. Does the ceremony, &s;o lately pa&s;t, authorize want of breeding?</P>
<P>Want of breeding, madam!&mdash;And he did &s;o &s;tare!</P>
<P>Leave me, this in&s;tant&mdash;I looked good-natured, I &s;uppo&s;e, in my anger; for he declared he would not; and again throwing his arms about me as I &s;at, joined his &s;harp face to mine, and pre&s;umed to ki&s;s me; Jenny &s;till in the room.</P>
<P>Now, Harriet, you never will de&s;ert me in a point of delicacy, I am &s;ure. You cannot defend the&s;e odi|ous freedoms in a matrimony &s;o young, unle&s;s you would be willing to be &s;erved &s;o your&s;elf.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e, that then I let loo&s;e my indig|nation upon him. And he &s;tole out, daring to mut|ter, and be di&s;plea&s;ed. The word <HI>devil</HI> was in his mouth.</P>
<P>Did he call <HI>me</HI> devil, Jenny?</P>
<P>No, indeed, madam, &s;aid the wench&mdash;And, Har|riet, &s;ee the ill example of &s;uch a free behaviour be|fore her: She pre&s;umed to prate in favour of the man's fit of fondne&s;s; yet, at other times, is a prude of a girl.</P>
<P>Before my anger was gone down, in again [It is truth, Harriet] came the bold wretch. I will not,
<PB N="195" REF="196">
&s;aid he, as you are not <HI>particularly</HI> employed, leave you&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, madam, you don't u&s;e me well. But if you will oblige me with your company to-mor|row morning&mdash;</P>
<P>No-where, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Only to breakfa&s;t with Mi&s;s Byron, my <HI>dear</HI>&mdash;As a mark of your obligingne&s;s, I reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>His dear!&mdash;Now I hate a hypocrite, of all things. I knew that he had a de&s;ign to make a &s;hew of his bride, as his property, at another place; and &s;eeing me angry, thought he would name a vi&s;it agreeable to me, and which at the &s;ame time would give him a me|rit with you, and pre&s;erve to him&s;elf the con&s;equence of being obliged by his obedient wife, at the word of authority.</P>
<P>From this fooli&s;h beginning aro&s;e our mighty quar|rel. What vexed me was, the <HI>art</HI> of the man, and the evident de&s;ign he had to get you of his &s;ide. He, in the cour&s;e of it, threatened me with appealing to you.&mdash;To intend to ruin me in the Love of my deare&s;t friend! Who, that valued that friend, could forgive it?

the Lord, I will note down this beginning moment of your authoritative demeanour.</P>
<P>My dear Lady G. [The wretch called me by his own name, perhaps farther to in&s;ult me] if I could bear this treatment, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to love you as I do.</P>
<P>So it is in <HI>Love</HI> to me, that you are to put on already all the hu&s;band!&mdash;Jenny! [Do you &s;ee, my Lord, affecting a whi&s;per how you da&s;h the poor wench? How like a fool &s;he looks at our folly!] Remember, Jenny, that to-morrow morning you carry my wed|ding-&s;uits to Mrs. Arnold; and tell her, &s;he has for|got the hanging-&s;leeves to the gowns. Let her put them on out of hand.</P>
<P>I was proceeding&mdash;But he rudely, gravely, and even with an air of &s;corn [There was no bearing <HI>that,</HI> you know] admoni&s;hed me; A little le&s;s wit, madam, and a little more di&s;cretion, would perhaps better be|come you.</P>
<P>This was too <HI>true</HI> to be forgiven. <HI>You'll</HI> &s;ay it, Harriet, if <HI>I</HI> don't.

<P>Now, my dear, was not this a high compliment to him? Ought he not to have taken it as &s;uch? E&s;peci|ally as I looked grave, and dropt him a very fine cour|te&s;y. But either his con&s;cience or his ill-nature (per|haps you'll &s;ay both) made him take it as a reflexion [True as you are alive, Harriet!]. He bit his lip. Jenny, begone, &s;aid he&mdash;Jenny, don't go, &s;aid I&mdash;Jenny knew not which to obey.

As married people are not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to their friends (who I once heard you &s;agely remark, would remember di&s;agreeable things, when the hone&s;t pair had forgot them) I was determined to be prudent. You would have been charmed with me, my dear, for my di&s;cretion. I will cheat by-&s;tanders, thought I; I will make my Lord and Lady L. Dr. Bartlett, and Emily, whom I had before &s;et in at cards, think we are egregiou&s;ly happy&mdash;And down I &s;at, intending, with a lamblike peaceablene&s;s, to make ob&s;ervations on the play. But &s;oon after, in whipt my indi&s;creet Lord, his colour heightened, his features working: And tho' I <HI>cautioned</HI> him not to expo&s;e him&s;elf, yet he a&s;&s;umed airs that were the occa&s;ion, as you &s;hall hear, of frighting away my company. He withdrew, <HI>in con|&s;equence of tho&s;e airs;</HI> and, after a little while (re|penting, as I hoped) he &s;ent for me out. Some wives would have played the queen Va&s;hti on their tyrant, and refu&s;ed to go: But I, all obedience (my vow, &s;o recently made, in my head) obeyed, at the very fir&s;t word: Yet you mu&s;t think that I (meek as I am na|turally) could not help recriminating. He was too lordly to be expo&s;tulated with.&mdash;There was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I tell you, madam,' and 'I won't be told, Sir;'</Q> and when I broke from the pa&s;&s;ionate creature, and hoped to find my company, behold! they were all gone! None but Emily left. And thus might poor Lady L. be &s;ent home, weeping, perhaps, for &s;uch an early marriage-tyranny exerted on her meek &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Well, and don't you think that we looked like a couple of fools at each other, when we &s;aw our&s;elves left alone, as I may &s;ay, to fight it out? I did expo|&s;tulate with him as mildly as I could: He would have made it up with me afterwards; but, no! there was no doing that, as a girl of your nice notions may be|lieve, after he had, by his violent airs, expo&s;ed us both before &s;o many witne&s;&s;es. In <HI>decency,</HI> therefore, I was obliged to keep it up: And now our mi&s;under&s;tanding

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from St. James's Square.</P>
<P>But, fir&s;t, I &s;hould tell you, that I had a vi&s;it from Lady Olivia and Lady Maffei. Our conver&s;ation was in Italian and French. Lady Olivia and I had a quarter of an hour's di&s;cour&s;e in private: You may

gue&s;s at our &s;ubject. She is not without that tender|ne&s;s of heart which is the indi&s;pen&s;able characteri&s;tic of a woman. She lamented the violence of her tem|per, in a manner &s;o affecting, that I cannot help pity|ing her, tho' at the in&s;tant I had in my head a certain attempt that makes me &s;hudder whenever I think of it. She regrets my going to Northampton&s;hire &s;o &s;oon. I have promi&s;ed to return her vi&s;it to-morrow in the afternoon.</P>
<P>She &s;ets out on Friday next for Oxford. She wi&s;hed I could accompany her. She re&s;olves to &s;ee all that is worth &s;eeing in the we&s;tern circuit, as I may call it. She ob&s;erves, &s;he &s;ays, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's &s;i&s;ters, and their Lords, are very particularly engaged at pre&s;ent; and are in expectation of a call to Wind|&s;or, to attend Lord W's nuptials: She will therefore, having attendants enough, and two men of con&s;idera|tion in her train, one of whom is not unacquainted with England, take cur&s;ory tours over the kingdom; having a ta&s;te for travelling, and finding it a great re|lief to her &s;pirits: And when Lady L. and Lady G. are more di&s;engaged, will review the &s;eats and places which &s;he &s;hall think worthy of a &s;econd vi&s;it, in their company.</P>
<P>She profe&s;&s;ed to like the people here, and the face of the country; and talked favourably of the rel gion of it: But, poor woman! &s;he likes all tho&s;e the bet|ter, I doubt not, for the &s;ake of one Engli&s;hman. Love, Lucy, gilds every object which bears a relation to the per&s;on beloved.</P>
<P>Lady Maffei was very free in blaming her niece for this excur&s;ion. She took her chiding patiently; but yet, like a per&s;on that thought it too much in her <HI>power</HI> to gratify the per&s;on blaming her, to pay much regard to what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I took a chair to Lady G's. Emily ran to meet me in the hall. She threw her arms about me: I re|joice you are come, &s;aid &s;he. Did you not meet

<P>Take the caution you gave to my Lord: Don't <HI>expo&s;e</HI> your&s;elf. And another; That you can|not more effectually do &s;o, than by expo&s;ing your hu&s;band.

<P>I am a meek, humble, docible creature. She turned to me, and made me a ru&s;tic courte&s;y, her hands before her: I'll try for it; tell me, if I am right. Then &s;tepping towards my Lord, who was with his back to us looking out at the window&mdash;and he turning about to her bowing&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, Mi&s;s Byron has been telling me more than I knew be|fore of my duty. She propo&s;es her&s;elf one day to
<PB N="206" REF="207">
make a won-der-ful obedient wife. It would have been well for you, perhaps, had I had <HI>her</HI> example to walk by. She &s;eems to &s;ay, that, now I am married, I mu&s;t be grave, &s;age, and pa&s;&s;ive: That <HI>&s;miles</HI> will hardly become me: That I mu&s;t be prim and formal, and reverence my hu&s;band.&mdash;If you think this beha|viour will become a married woman, and expect it from me, pray, my Lord, put me right by your <HI>frowns,</HI> whenever I &s;hall be wrong. For the future, if I ever find my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to be very light-hearted, I will a&s;k your leave before I give way to it. And now, what is next to be done? humorou&s;ly courte&s;y|ing, her hands before her.</P>
<P>He cla&s;ped her in his arms: Dear provoking crea|ture! This, this is next to be done&mdash;I a&s;k you but to love me half as much as I love you, and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t man on earth.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid I, you ruin all by this conde&s;cen|&s;ion on a &s;peech and air &s;o ungracious. If this is all you get by it, never, never, my Lord, fall out again. O Charlotte! If you are not generous, you come off much, <HI>much</HI> too ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>Well now, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, holding out her hand, as if threatening me, let you and me, man and wife like, join again&s;t the interpo&s;er in our quarrels.&mdash;Harriet, I will not forgive you, for this la&s;t part of your lecture.</P>

<P>And thus was this idle quarrel made up. All that vexes me on the occa&s;ion is, that it was not made up with dignity on my Lord's part. His hone&s;t heart &s;o overflowed with joy at his lips, that the naughty crea|ture, by her arch leers, every now-and-then, &s;hewed, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her con&s;equence to his happi|ne&s;s.

<P>IT would puzzle you to gue&s;s at a vi&s;iter I had this morning&mdash;Hone&s;t Mr. Fowler. I was very glad to &s;ee him. He brought me a Letter from his worthy uncle. Good Sir Rowland! I had a joy that I thought I &s;hould not have had while I &s;tay'd in London, on its being put in my hand, tho' the contents gave me &s;en&s;ible pain. I inclo&s;e it. It is dated from Caermarthen. Be plea&s;ed to read it here.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Caermarthen, <DATE>April <HI>11.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW &s;hall I, in fit manner, in&s;cribe my Letter to the lovelie&s;t of women! I don't mean <HI>becau&s;e</HI> of your loveline&s;s; but whether as <HI>daughter</HI> or not, as you did me the honour to call your&s;elf. Really, and truly, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I had rather call you by <HI>another</HI> name, tho' a little more remote as to con|&s;anguinity. Lord have mercy upon me, how have I talked of you! How many of our fine Caermarthen girls have I filled with envy of your peerle&s;s perfec|tions.</P>
<P>Here am I &s;ettled to my heart's content, could I but obtain&mdash;You know whom I mean.&mdash;A town of gen|try: A fine country round us&mdash;A fine e&s;tate of our own. E&s;teemed, nay, for that matter, <HI>beloved,</HI> by all our neighbours and tenants. Who &s;o happy as Row|land Meredith, if his poor boy could be happy!&mdash;Ah, madam!&mdash;And can't it be &s;o? I am <HI>afraid</HI> of a&s;king. Yet I under&s;tand, that, notwith&s;tandig all the Jack-a-dandies that have been fluttering about you, you are what you were when I left town. Some whi&s;pers have
<PB N="208" REF="209">
gone out of a fine gentleman, indeed, who had a great kindne&s;s for you; but yet that &s;omething was in the way between you. The Lord ble&s;s and pro&s;per my dear <HI>daughter,</HI> as I mu&s;t then call you, and not <HI>niece,</HI> if you have any kindne&s;s for him. And if as now you have, it would be wonderfully gracious if you would but give half a hint of it to my nephew, or if &s;o be you will not to him, to me, your <HI>father</HI> you know, under your own precious hand. The Lord be good unto me! But I &s;hall never &s;ee the She that will &s;trike my fancy, as you have done. But what a dreadful thing would it be, if you, who are &s;o much courted and admired by many fine gallants, &s;hould at la&s;t be taken with a man who could not be yours! God forbid that &s;uch a di&s;a&s;trous thing &s;hould happen! I profe&s;s to you, madam, that a tear or two have &s;trayed down my cheeks at the thoughts of it. For why? Becau&s;e you play'd no tricks with any man: You never were a coquet, as they call 'em. You dealt plainly, &s;incerely, and tenderly too, to all men; of which my nephew and I can bear witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, but what now is the end of my writing?&mdash;Lord love you, cannot, cannot you at la&s;t give com|fort to two hone&s;t hearts? Hone&s;ter you never knew! And yet if you could, I dare &s;ay you would. Well, then, and if you can't, we mu&s;t &s;it down as contented as we can; that's all we have for it.&mdash;But, poor young man! Look at him, if you read this before him. <HI>Strangely</HI> altered! Poor young man!&mdash;And if as how you cannot, why then, God ble&s;s my <HI>daughter;</HI> that's all. And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that you have our prayers every Lord's day, from the bottom of our hearts.</P>
<P>And now, if you will keep a &s;ecret, I will tell it you; and yet, when I began, I did not intend it: The poor youth mu&s;t not know it. It is done in the &s;inglene&s;s of our hearts; and if you think we mean to gain your Love for us by it, I do a&s;&s;ure you, that you wrong us. My nephew declares, that he never will
<PB N="209" REF="210">
marry, if it be not <HI>Somebody:</HI> And he has made his will, and &s;o have I his uncle; and, let me tell you, that if as how I cannot have a <HI>niece,</HI> my <HI>daughter</HI> &s;hall be the better for having known, and treated as kindly, as power was lent her,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Love and Service to Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, and all friends who enquire after me. Farewel. God ble&s;s you! Amen.</P>
<P>Have you, could you, Lucy, read this Letter with dry eyes? Generous, worthy, hone&s;t men! I read but half way before Mr. Fowler&mdash;Glad I was, that I read no further. I &s;hould not have been able to have kept his uncle's &s;ecret, if I had; had it been but to di&s;claim the acceptance of the generous purpo&s;e. The carrying it into effect would exceedingly di&s;tre&s;s me, be&s;ides the pain the demi&s;e of the hone&s;t man would give me; and the more, as I be&s;poke the fa|therly relation from him my&s;elf. If &s;uch a thing were to be, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's genero&s;ity to the Danby's &s;hould be my example.</P>
<P>Do you know, Mr. Fowler, &s;aid I, the contents of the Letter you have put into my hand?</P>
<P>No farther than that my uncle told me, it contained profe&s;&s;ions of fatherly love; and with <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> only&mdash;But without &s;o much as expre&s;&s;ing his <HI>hopes.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Rowland is a good man, &s;aid I: I have not read above half his Letter. There &s;eems to be too much of the <HI>father</HI> in it, for me to read further, before my <HI>brother.</HI> God ble&s;s my <HI>brother</HI> Fowler, and reward the <HI>fatherly</HI> love of Sir Rowland to his <HI>daughter</HI> By|ron! I mu&s;t write to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler, poor man! profoundly &s;ighed; bow|ed; with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a look of re&s;pectful acquie&s;cence&mdash;Ble&s;s
<PB N="210" REF="211">
me, my dear, how am I to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides! by <HI>good</HI> men too; as Sir Charles could &s;ay by good women.</P>
<P>Is there nothing le&s;s than giving my&s;elf to either, that I can do to &s;hew Mr. Orme and Mr. Fowler my true value for them.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Fowler!&mdash;Indeed he looks to be, as Sir Rowland hints, not well.&mdash;Such a mode&s;t, &s;uch an humble, &s;uch a &s;ilent Lover!&mdash;He co&s;t me tears at parting: I could not hide them. He heaped prai&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings upon me, and hurried away at la&s;t, to hide his emotion, with a &s;entence unfini&s;hed&mdash;God pre&s;erve you, dear and worthy Sir! was all I could <HI>try</HI> to &s;ay. The la&s;t words &s;tuck in my throat, till he was out of hearing; and then I prayed for ble&s;&s;ings upon him and his uncle: And repeated them, with fre&s;h tears, on reading the re&s;t of the affecting Let|ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler told Mr. Reeves, before I &s;aw him, that he is to go to Caermarthen for the benefit of his native air, in a week. He let him know where he lodged in town. He had been riding for his health and diver&s;ion about the country, ever &s;ince his uncle went; and has not been yet at Caermarthen.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mr. Fowler had once, if <HI>but</HI> once, called me <HI>&s;i&s;ter:</HI> It would have been &s;uch a <HI>kind</HI> acquie&s;cence, as would have given me &s;ome little plea&s;ure on recol|lection. Methinks I don't know how to have done writing of Sir Rowland and Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>I &s;at down, however, while the uncle and ne|phew filled my thoughts, and wrote to the former, I have enclo&s;ed the copy of my Letter. Adieu, my Lucy.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, April <HI>19.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT was with great plea&s;ure that I received, this day, the kinde&s;t Letter that ever was written by a real Father to his deare&s;t Child. I was re&s;olved that I would not go to re&s;t till I had acknowleged the fa|vour.</P>
<P>How &s;weet is the name of <HI>father</HI> to a young per&s;on who, out of near one-and-twenty years of life, has for more than half the time been bereaved of hers; and who was al&s;o one of the be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>You gave me an additional plea&s;ure in cau&s;ing this remembrance of your promi&s;ed paternal goodne&s;s to be given me by Mr. Fowler in per&s;on. Till I knew you and him, I had no father, no brother.</P>
<P>How good you are in your apprehen&s;ions that there may be a man on whom your daughter has ca&s;t her eye, and who cannot look upon <HI>her</HI> with the &s;ame di&s;tinction&mdash;O that I had been near you when you wrote that &s;weetly compa&s;&s;ionating, that indulgent pa&s;&s;age! I would have wiped the tears from your eyes my&s;elf, and reverenced you as my true father.</P>
<P>You demand of me, as my father, a hint, or half a hint, as you call it, to be given to my brother Fowler; or if not to him, to you. To him, whom I call father, I <HI>mean</HI> all the duty of a child. I call him not father <HI>nominally</HI> only: I will, irk&s;ome as the &s;ubject is, own, without re&s;erve, the truth to you (In tenderne&s;s to my brother, how could I to him?)&mdash;There is a man whom, and whom only, I could love as a good wife ought to love her hu&s;band. He is the be&s;t of men. O my good Sir Rowland Meredith! if you knew him, you would love him your&s;elf, and own him for your &s;on. I will not conceal his name from
<PB N="212" REF="213">
my father: Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is the man. En|quire about him. His character will ri&s;e upon you from every mouth. He engaged fir&s;t all your daughter's gratitude, by re&s;cuing her from a great danger and oppre&s;&s;ion; for he is as brave as he is good: And how could &s;he help &s;uffering a tenderne&s;s to &s;pring up from her gratitude, of which &s;he was never before &s;en&s;ible to any man in the world? There <HI>is</HI> &s;ome|thing in the way, my good Sir; but not that pro|ceeds from his &s;lights or contempts. Your daughter could not live, if it were &s;o. A glorious creature is in the way! who has &s;uffered for him, who <HI>does</HI> &s;uffer for him: He ought to be hers, and only hers; and if &s;he can be recovered from a fearful malady that has &s;eized her mind, he probably will. My daily prayers are, that God will re&s;tore her!</P>
<P>But yet, my dear Sir, my Friend, my Father! my e&s;teem for this noble&s;t of men is of &s;uch a nature, that I cannot give my hand to any other: My Father Meredith would not wi&s;h me to give a hand without a heart.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the ca&s;e. Let it, I be&s;eech you, re&s;t within your own brea&s;t, and my brother Fowler's. How few minds are there delicate and candid enough to &s;ee circum&s;tances of this kind in the light they ought to appear in! And pray for me, my good Sir Row|land; not that the way may be &s;moothed to what once would have crowned my wi&s;hes as to this life; but that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on may be happy with the Lady that is, and ought to be, deare&s;t to his heart; and that your daughter may be enabled to rejoice in their felicity. What, my good Sir, is this &s;pan of life, that a pa&s;&s;enger through it &s;hould &s;eek to overturn the intere&s;ts of others to e&s;tabli&s;h her own? And can the &s;ingle life be a grievance? Can it be de&s;titute of the noble&s;t tenderne&s;&s;es? No, Sir. You that have lived to an advanced age, in a fair &s;ame, &s;urrounded with comforts, and as tender to a worthy nephew, as
<PB N="213" REF="214">
the mo&s;t indulgent father could be to the worthie&s;t of &s;ons, can te&s;tify for me, that it is not.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, one word&mdash;I di&s;claim, but yet in all thankfulne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, the acceptance of the favour &s;ignified to be intended me in the latter part of the paternal Let|ter before me. Our acquaintance began with a hope, on your &s;ide, that I could not encourage. As I could not, Shall I accept of the benefit from you, to which I could only have been entitled (and that as I had be|haved) had I been able to oblige you?&mdash;No, Sir! I will not, in this ca&s;e, be benefited, when I cannot be|nefit. Put me not therefore, I be&s;eech you, Sir, if &s;uch an event (deplored by me, as it would be;) &s;hould happen, upon the nece&s;&s;ity of enquiring after your other relations and friends. Sir Rowland Meredith my father, and Mr. Fowler my brother&punc; are all to me of the family they di&s;tingui&s;h by their relation, that I know at pre&s;ent. Let me not be made known to the re&s;t by a di&s;tinction that would be unju&s;t to them, and to your&s;elf, as it mu&s;t deprive you of the grace of obliging tho&s;e who have more than a &s;tran|ger's claim; and mu&s;t, in the event, lay them under the appearance of an obligation to that &s;tranger for doing them common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I u&s;e the word <HI>&s;tranger</HI> with reference to tho&s;e of your family and friends to whom I mu&s;t really appear in that light. But, laying the&s;e con&s;iderations a&s;ide, in which I am determined not to interfere with <HI>them,</HI> I am, with the tendere&s;t regard, dear and good Sir,</P>

<P>I Shall di&s;patch this by your Gib&s;on early in the morning. It was kind in you to bid him call, in his way down; for now I &s;hall be almo&s;t &s;ure of meeting (if not my uncle) your brother, and who knows, but my Lucy her&s;elf, at Dun&s;table? Where, barring accidents, I &s;hall be on Friday night.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee &s;ome of the worthie&s;t people in the world, my dear, if you come, all prepared to love you; but let not any-body be put to inconvenience to meet me at Dun&s;table. My noble friends here will proceed with me to Stratford, or even to Northamp|ton, they &s;ay; but they will &s;ee me &s;afe in the pro|tection of Somebody I love, and whom they mu&s;t love for my &s;ake.</P>
<P>I don't wonder that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on loves Mr. Beauchamp: He is a very worthy and &s;en&s;ible man. He, as every body el&s;e, idolizes Sir Charles. It is &s;ome plea&s;ure to me, Lucy, that I &s;tand high in his e&s;teem. To be re&s;pected by the worthy, is one of the greate&s;t felicities in this life; for it is to be ranked as one of them. Sir Harry and his Lady are come to town. All, it &s;eems, is harmony in that fa|mily. They cannot bear Mr. Beauchamp's ab&s;ence from them for three days together. All the neigh|bouring gentlemen are in love with him. His man|ners are &s;o gentle; his temper &s;o even; &s;o de&s;irous to oblige; &s;o genteel in his per&s;on; &s;o plea&s;ing in his addre&s;s; he mu&s;t undoubtedly make a good woman very happy.</P>
<P>But Emily, poor girl! &s;ees only Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on with eyes of Love. Mr. Beauchamp is, how|ever, greatly plea&s;ed with Emily. He told Lady G.
<PB N="215" REF="216">
that he thought her a fine young creature; and that her mind was &s;till more amiable than her per&s;on. But his behaviour to her is extremely prudent. He &s;ays finer things <HI>of</HI> her, than <HI>to</HI> her: Yet &s;urely I am mi&s;|taken if he meditates not in her, his future wife. Mr. Beauchamp will be one of my e&s;corte.</P>
<P>Emily, at her own reque&s;t, is to go to Colnebrooke with Lady L. after I am gone.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves will ride. Lord L. and Lord G. will al&s;o oblige me with their company on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>In my cou&s;in's coach will be Lady L. Lady G. Emily, and I. My cou&s;in Reeves is forbidden to venture.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take leave of Lady Olivia and Lady Maffei to-morrow morning; when they will &s;et out for their projected tour. To-morrow we and the whole Gran|di&s;on family are to dine together at Lord L's, for the la&s;t time. It will be a mournful dining-time on that account.</P>
<P>Lady Betty Williams, her daughter, and Mi&s;s Cle|ments, &s;upp'd with us this night, and took leave of me in the tendere&s;t manner. They greatly regret my going down &s;o &s;oon, as they call it.</P>
<P>As to the public diver&s;ions, which they wi&s;h me to &s;tay and give into, to be &s;ure I &s;hould have been glad to have been better qualified to have entertained you with the performances of this or that actor, this or that mu&s;ician, and the like: But, frighted by the vile plot upon me at a ma&s;querade, I was thrown out of that cour&s;e of diver&s;ion, and indeed into more affect|ing, more intere&s;ting engagements; into the know|lege of a family that had no need to look out of it&s;elf for entertainments: And, be&s;ides, Are not all the company we &s;ee as vi&s;iters or gue&s;ts, full of the&s;e things! I have &s;een the principal performers, in every way, often enough to give me a notion of their per|formances, tho' I have not troubled you with &s;uch common things as revolve every &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">
You know I am far from &s;lighting the innocent plea&s;ures in which others delight&mdash;It would have been happier for me, perhaps had I had more lei&s;ure to at|tend tho&s;e amu&s;ements&punc; than I have found. Yet I am not &s;ure, neither: For methinks, with all the pangs that my &s;u&s;pen&s;es have co&s;t me, I would not but have known Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, his &s;i&s;ters, his Emily, and Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>I could only have wi&s;hed to have been &s;pared Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's vile attempt: Then, if I had come acquainted with this family, it would have been as I come acquainted with others: My gratitude had not been engaged &s;o deeply.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;But what &s;ignify all the&s;e If's?&mdash;What has been, has; what mu&s;t be, mu&s;t. Only love me, my dear friends, as you <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to love me. If I was a good girl when I left you, I hope I am not a bad one now, that I am returning to you. My morals, I ble&s;s God, are unhurt: My heart is not corrupted by the vanities of the great town: I have a little more experience than I had: And if I have &s;everely paid for it, it is not at the price of my reputation. And I hope, if nobody has benefited by me, &s;ince I have been in town, that no one has &s;uffered by me. Poor Mr. Fowler!&mdash;I could not help it, you know. Had I, by little &s;nares, follies, coquetries, &s;ought to draw him on, and entangle him, his future welfare would with rea&s;on, be more the &s;ubject of my &s;olicitude, than it is now <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> it &s;hould be; tho' indeed I cannot <HI>help</HI> making it a good deal &s;o.</P>

<P>DR. Bartlett has ju&s;t now taken leave of me, in my own dre&s;&s;ing-room. The parting &s;cene between us was tender.</P>
<P>I have not given you my opinion of Mi&s;s Wil|liams. Had I &s;een her at my fir&s;t coming to town, I &s;hould have taken as much notice of her, in my Let|ters to you, as I did of the two Mi&s;s Brambers,

Mi&s;s Darlington, Mi&s;s Cantillon, Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree, and others of my own Sex; and of Mr. Somner&punc; Mr. Al|le&s;tree, Mr. Walden, of the other; who took my fir&s;t notice, as they fell early in my way, and with whom it is po&s;&s;ible, as well as with the town&punc;diver&s;i|ons, I had been more intimate, had not Sir Hargrave's vile attempt carried me out of their acquaintance into a much higher; which of nece&s;&s;ity, as well as choice, entirely engro&s;&s;ed my attention. But <HI>now</HI> how in&s;i|pid would any new characters appear to you, if they were but of a like ca&s;t with tho&s;e I have mentioned, were I to make &s;uch the &s;ubjects of my pen, and had I time before me; which I cannot have, to write again, before I embrace you all, my dear, my ever|dear and indulgent friends!</P>
<P>I will only &s;ay, that Mi&s;s Williams is a genteel girl; but will hardly be more than one of the <HI>better</HI> &s;ort of modern women of condition; and that &s;he is to be cla&s;&s;ed &s;o high, will be owing more to Mi&s;s Cle|ments's le&s;&s;on's, than, I am afraid, to her mother's ex|ample.</P>
<P>Is it, Lucy, that I have more experience and di&s;|cernment now, or le&s;s charity and good-nature, than when I fir&s;t came town? for then I thought well, in the main, of Lady Betty Williams. But tho' &s;he is a good-natur'd, obliging woman; &s;he is &s;o immer&s;ed in the love of public diver&s;ions! &s;o fond of routs, drums, hurricanes&mdash;Ble&s;s me, my dear! how learned &s;hould I have been in all the gaieties of the modern life; what a fine Lady, po&s;&s;ibly; had I not been carried into more rational (however to me they have been more painful) &s;cenes; and had I followed the lead of this Lady, as &s;he (kindly, as to her intention) had de&s;ign|ed I &s;hould!</P>
<P>In the afternoon Mr. Beauchamp is to introduce Sir Harry and Lady Beauchamp, on their fir&s;t vi&s;it to the two &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that my cou&s;ins and

I are to attend the good Counte&s;s of D. for one half hour, after we have taken leave of Lady Olivia and her aunt.</P>
<P>And now, my Lucy, do I &s;hut up my corre&s;pond|ence with you from London. My heart beats high with the hope of being as indulgently received by all you, my deare&s;t friends, as I u&s;ed to be after a &s;horter ab&s;ence: For I am, and ever will be,</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXXII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> To Lady G.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Selby-hou&s;e, <DATE>Monday April <HI>24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THO' the kind friends with whom I parted at Dun&s;table were plea&s;ed, one and all, to allow, that the corre&s;pondence which is to pa&s;s between my dear Lady G. and their Harriet, &s;hould an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectations of each upon her, in the writing way; and tho' (at <HI>your</HI> motion, remember, not at mine) they promi&s;ed to be contented with hearing read to them &s;uch parts of my Letters as you &s;hould think proper to communicate; yet cannot I di&s;pen&s;e with my duty to Lady L. my Emily, my cou&s;in Reeves, and Dr. Bart|lett. Accordingly I write to them by this po&s;t; and I charge <HI>you,</HI> my dear, with my &s;incere and thankful compliments to your Lord, and to Mr. Beauchamp, for their favours.</P>
<P>What an agreeable night, in the main, was Friday night! Had we not been to &s;eparate next morning, it would have been an agreeable one indeed!</P>
<P><HI>Is</HI> not my aunt Selby an excellent woman? But you all admired her. She admires you all. I will tell you another time, what &s;he &s;aid of you, my dear, in parti|cular.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Lucy, too&mdash;<HI>is</HI> &s;he not an amiable crea|ture?
<PB N="219" REF="220">
&mdash;Indeed you all were delighted with her. But I take plea&s;ure in recollecting your approbations of one I &s;o dearly love. She is as prudent as Lady L. and, now our Nancy is &s;o well recovered, as chearful as Lady G. You &s;aid, you would provide a good hu&s;|band for her: Don't forget. The man, whoever he be, cannot be too good for my Lucy. Nancy is &s;uch another good girl: But &s;o I told you.</P>
<P>Well, and pray, Did you ever meet with &s;o plea|&s;ant a man as my uncle Selby? What &s;hould we have done, when we talked of your brother, when we talked of our parting, had it not been for him? You looked upon me every now-and-then, when he re|turned your &s;martne&s;s upon him, as if you thought I had let him know &s;ome of your perver&s;ne&s;&s;es to Lord G.&mdash;And do you think I did not? Indeed I did. Can you imagine that your frank-hearted Harriet, who hides not from her friends her own faults, &s;hould con|ceal yours?&mdash;But what a particular character is yours! Every-body blames you, that knows of your over|liveline&s;&s;es; yet every-body loves you&mdash;I think, for your very faults. Had it not been &s;o, do you ima|gine I could ever have loved you, after you had led Lady L. to join with you, on a certain teazing occa&s;i|on?&mdash;My uncle dotes upon you!</P>
<P>But don't tell Emily that my cou&s;in James Selby is in Love with her. That he may not, on the &s;core of the dear girl's fortune, be thought pre&s;umptuous, let me tell you, that he is almo&s;t of age; and, when he is, comes into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hand&s;ome e&s;tate. He has many good qualities. I have, in &s;hort, a very great value for him; but not enough, tho' he is my relation, to wi&s;h him my &s;till more beloved Emily. Dear crea|ture! methinks I &s;till feel her parting tears on my cheek!</P>
<P>You charge me to be as minute, in the Letters I write to you, as I u&s;ed to be to my friends here: And
<PB N="220" REF="221">
you promi&s;ed to be as circum&s;tantial in yours. I will &s;et you the example: Do you be &s;ure to follow it.</P>
<P>We baited at Stony-Stratford. I was <HI>afraid</HI> how it would be: There were the two bold creatures, Mr. Greville, and Mr. Fenwick, ready to receive us. A hand&s;ome collation as at our &s;etting out, &s;o now, be&s;poke by them, was &s;et on the table. How they came by their intelligence, nobody knows: We were all concerned to &s;ee them. They &s;eemed half-mad for joy. My cou&s;in James had alighted to hand us out; but Mr. Greville was &s;o earne&s;t to offer his hand, that tho' my cou&s;in was equally ready, I thought I could not deny to his &s;olicitude for the poor favour, &s;uch a mark of civility. Be&s;ides, if I had, it would have been di&s;tingui&s;hing him for more than a com|mon neighbour, you know. Mr. Fenwick took the other hand, when I had &s;tept out of the coach, and then (with &s;o much pride, as made me a&s;hamed of my&s;elf) they hurried me between them, thro' the inn|yard, and into the room they had engaged for us; ble&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, all the way, for my coming down Harriet Byron.</P>
<P>I looked about as if for the dear friends I had parted with at Dun&s;table. This is not, thought I, &s;o de|lightful an inn as they made that&mdash;Now <HI>they,</HI> thought I, are ju&s;t got to Barnet, in their way to London, as we are here in ours to Northampton.&mdash;But ah! where, where is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on at this time? And I &s;ighed! But don't read this, and &s;uch &s;trokes as this, to any body but Lord and Lady L.&mdash;You won't, you &s;ay&mdash;Thank you, Charlotte.&mdash;I will call you <HI>Charlotte,</HI> when I think of it, as you commanded me.</P>
<P>The joy we had at Dun&s;table, was ea&s;y, &s;erene, deep, full, as I may &s;ay; it was the joy of &s;en&s;ible people: But the joy here was made by the two gen|tlemen, mad, loud, and even noi&s;y. They hardly were able to contain them&s;elves; and my uncle, and cou&s;in James, were forced to be loud, to be heard.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222">
Mr. Orme, good Mr. Orme, when we came near his park, was on the highway-&s;ide, perhaps near the very &s;pot where he &s;tood to &s;ee me pa&s;s to London &s;o many weeks ago&mdash;Poor man!&mdash;When I fir&s;t &s;aw him (which was before the coach came near, for I looked out only, as thinking I would mark the place where I la&s;t beheld him) he looked with &s;o <HI>di&s;con&s;olate</HI> an air, and &s;o fixed, that I compa&s;&s;ionately &s;aid to my&s;elf, Surely the worthy man has not been there ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I twitched the &s;tring ju&s;t in time: The coach &s;topt. Mr. Orme, &s;aid I, How do you? Well, I hope?&mdash;How does Mi&s;s Orme?</P>
<P>I had my hand on the coach-door. He &s;natched it. It was not an unwilling hand. He pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips. God be prai&s;ed, &s;aid he (with a countenance, O how altered for the better!) for permitting me once more to behold that face&mdash;that <HI>angelic</HI> face, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, Mr. Orme! &s;aid I: I am glad to &s;ee you. Adieu.</P>
<P>The coach drove on. Poor Mr. Orme! &s;aid my aunt.</P>
<P>Mr. Orme, Lucy, &s;aid I, don't look &s;o ill as you wrote he was.</P>
<P>His joy to &s;ee you, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;But Mr. Orme is in a declining way.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, on the coach &s;topping, rode back ju&s;t as it was going on again&mdash;And with a loud laugh&mdash;How the d&mdash;l came Orme to know of your coming, madam!&mdash;Poor fellow! It was very kind of you to &s;top your coach to &s;peak to the &s;tatue. And he laughed again.&mdash;Non&s;en&s;ical! At what?</P>
<P>My grandmamma Shirley, deare&s;t of parents! her youth, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, renewed by the ex|pectation of &s;o &s;oon &s;eeing her darling child, came (as my aunt told us, you know) on Thur&s;day night to Selby-hou&s;e, to charge her and Lucy with her ble&s;&s;ing to me; and re&s;olving to &s;tay there to receive me. Our beloved Nancy was al&s;o to be there; &s;o were
<PB N="222" REF="223">
two other cou&s;ins, Kitty and Patty Holles, <HI>good</HI> young creatures; who, in my ab&s;ence, had attended my grandmamma at every convenient opportunity, and whom I al&s;o found here.</P>
<P>When we came within &s;ight of this hou&s;e, Now, Harriet, &s;aid Lucy, I &s;ee the &s;ame kind of emotions beginning to ari&s;e in your face and bo&s;om, as Lady G. told us you &s;hewed when you fir&s;t &s;aw your aunt at Dun&s;table. My grandmamma! &s;aid I, I am in &s;ight of the dear hou&s;e that holds her: I hope &s;he is here. But I will not &s;urpri&s;e her with my joy to &s;ee her. Lie &s;till, throbbing impatience! &s;peaking to my heart.</P>
<P>But when the coach (attended by many neighbours and friends, who, like a gathering &s;nowball, had got together, within a few miles of Selby-hou&s;e) &s;et us down at the inner-gate, there, in the outward-hall, &s;at my ble&s;&s;ed grandmamma. The moment I beheld her, my intended caution for&s;ook me: I &s;prang by my aunt, and, before the foot &s;tep could be put down, flew, as it were, out of the coach, and threw my&s;elf at her feet, wrapping my arms about her: Ble&s;s, ble&s;s, &s;aid I, your Harriet! I could not at the moment, &s;ay another word.</P>
<P>Great God! &s;aid the pious parent, her hands and eyes lifted up, Great God! I thank thee! Then fold|ing her arms about my neck, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my forehead, my check, my lips&mdash;God ble&s;s my Love! Pride of my life! the mo&s;t precious of a hundred daughters! How does my Child&mdash;My Harriet&mdash;O my Love!&mdash;After &s;uch dangers, &s;uch trials, &s;uch hara&s;&s;ings&mdash;Once more, God be prai&s;ed that I cla&s;p to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> heart, my Harriet!</P>
<P>Separate them, &s;eparate them, &s;aid my facetious uncle (yet he had tears in his eyes) before they grow together!&mdash;Madam, to my grandmamma, &s;he is <HI>our</HI> Harriet, as well as <HI>yours:</HI> Let us welcome the <HI>&s;aucy</HI> girl, on her re-entrance into the&s;e doors!&mdash;Saucy, I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hall &s;oon find her.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
My grandmamma withdrew her fond arms: Take her, take her, &s;aid &s;he, each in turn: But I think I never can part with her again.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;aluted me, and bid me very kindly wel|come home: So did my aunt: So did Lucy&mdash;My equally-beloved Nancy&mdash;So did every one.</P>
<P>How can I return the obligations which the love of all my friends lays upon me? To be good, to be grateful, is not enough&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">uce <HI>that</HI> one ought to be for one's own &s;ake. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t a &s;weet thing is it to be beloved by worthy neighbours! I had &s;everal vi&s;iters la&s;t night, and compliments without number, on my arrival:&mdash;Compliments, for what? For having lo&s;t the better half of my heart? Don't you think I look &s;illy to my&s;elf? You bid me be free in my confe&s;&s;ions. You promi&s;e to look my Letters over before you read them to any-body; and to mark pa&s;&s;ages proper to be kept to your&s;elf&mdash;Pray do.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick were here &s;eparate|ly, an hour ago: I thanked them for their civility on the road, and not <HI>ungraciou&s;ly,</HI> as Mr. Greville told my uncle, as to him. He was not, he &s;aid, without hopes, yet; &s;ince I knew not how to be ungrateful. Mr. Greville builds, as he always did, a merit on his civility; and by that means &s;inks, in the narrower Lover, the claim he might otherwi&s;e make to the title of the generous neighbour.</P>
<P>MISS ORME has ju&s;t been here. She could not help throwing in a word for her brother.</P>
<P>You will gue&s;s, my dear Lady G. at the &s;ubject of our conver&s;ations here, and what they <HI>will be,</HI> morn|ing, noon, and night, for a week to come. My grandmamma is better in health than I have known her for a year or two pa&s;t. The health of people in years <HI>can</HI> mend but &s;lowly; and they are &s;low to ac|knowlege it in their own favour. My grandmamma, however, allows that &s;he is better within the&s;e few
<PB N="224" REF="225">
days pa&s;t; but attributes the amendment to her Har|riet's return.</P>
<P>How do they all ble&s;s, revere, extol, your noble brother!&mdash;How do they wi&s;h&mdash;And how do they regret&mdash;You know what&mdash;Yet how ready are they to ap|plaud your Harriet, if &s;he can hold her magnanimity, in preferring the happine&s;s of Clementina to her own!&mdash;My grandmamma and aunt are of opinion, that I <HI>&s;hould;</HI> and they prai&s;e me for the genero&s;ity of my effort, whether the &s;uperior merits of the man will or will not allow me to &s;ucceed in it. But my uncle, my Lucy, and my Nancy, from their unbounded love of me, think a little, and but a little, narrower; and, believing it will go hard with me, &s;ay, It <HI>is</HI> hard. My uncle, in particular, &s;ays the very preten&s;ion is &s;light and non&s;en&s;e: But, however, if the girl, added he, can <HI>parade</HI> away her pa&s;&s;ion for an object &s;o worthy; with all my heart: It will be but ju&s;t, that the roman|cing evelations, which &s;o often drive head&s;trong girls into difficulties, &s;hould now-and-then help a more di&s;|creet one out of them.</P>
<P>Adieu, my beloved Lady G. <HI>Repeated</HI> compli|ments, love, thanks, to my Lord and Lady L. to my Emily, to Dr. Bartlett, to Mr. Beauchamp, and par|ticularly to my Lord G. Dear, dear Charlotte, be good! Let me be&s;eech you be good! If you are <HI>not,</HI> you will have every one of <HI>my</HI> friends who met you at Dun&s;table, and, from <HI>their</HI> report, my grandmamma and Nancy, again&s;t you; for they find but one fault in my Lord: It is, that he &s;eems too fond of a Lady, who, by her archne&s;s of looks, and half-&s;aucy turns upon him, even before <HI>them,</HI> evidently &s;hewed&mdash;Shall I &s;ay what? But I &s;tand up for you, my dear. Your gratitude, your genero&s;ity, your honour, I &s;ay, (and why &s;hould I not add your <HI>duty?)</HI> will certainly make you one of the mo&s;t obliging of wives, to the mo&s;t affectionate of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;ays, He hopes &s;o: But tho' he adores

<P>EVERY one of the Dun&s;table party &s;ay, that you are a grateful and good girl. Beauchamp can talk of nobody el&s;e of our Sex: I believe in my con|&s;cience he is in Love with you. I think all the un|provided for young women where-ever you come mu&s;t hate you. Was you never by &s;urprize carried into the chamber of a friend labouring with the Small|pox, in the infectious &s;tage of it?&mdash;O but I think you once &s;aid you had had that di&s;temper. But your mind, Harriet, were your face to be ruined, would make you admirers. The fellows who could think of preferring even &s;uch a face to &s;uch a heart, may be turned over to the cla&s;s of in&s;ignificants.</P>
<P><HI>Is</HI> not your aunt Selby, you a&s;k, an excellent wo|man?&mdash;She is. I admire her. But I am very angry with you for deferring to another time, acquainting me with what &s;he &s;aid of me. When we are taken with any-body, we love they &s;hould be taken with us. Teazing Harriet! You know what an immoderate quantity of curio&s;ity I have. Never &s;erve me &s;o again!</P>
<P>I am in Love with your cou&s;in Lucy. Were either Fenwick or Greville good enough&mdash;But they are not
<PB N="226" REF="227">
I think &s;he &s;hall have Mr. Orme. Nancy, you &s;ay, is &s;uch another good girl. I don't doubt it. Is &s;he not your cou&s;in, and Lucy's &s;i&s;ter? But I cannot under|take for every good girl who wants a hu&s;band. I wi&s;h I had &s;een Lucy a fortnight ago: Then Nancy might have had Mr. Orme, and Lucy &s;hould have had Lord G. He admires her greatly. And do you think that a man who at that time profe&s;&s;ed for me &s;o much Love and Service, and all that, would have &s;crupled to oblige me, had I (as I ea&s;ily &s;hould) proved to him, that he would have been a much happier man than he could hope to be with Somebody el&s;e?</P>
<P>Your uncle is a plea&s;ant man: But tell him I &s;ay, that the man would be out of his wits, that did not make the preference he does in favour of his <HI>Dame</HI> Selby, as he calls her. Tell him al&s;o, if you plea&s;e, in return for his plain dealing, that I &s;ay, he <HI>&s;tudies</HI> too much for his plea&s;antries: He is continually hunt|ing for occa&s;ions to be &s;mart. I have heard my father &s;ay, that this was the fault of &s;ome wits of his ac|quaintance, whom he ranked among the wit-lings for it. If you think it will mortify him more, you may tell him (for I am very revengeful when I think my|&s;elf affronted) that were I at liberty, which, God help me, I am not! I would &s;ooner choo&s;e for a hu&s;band the man I <HI>have</HI> (poor &s;oul, as I now and then think him) than &s;uch a teazing creature as him&s;elf, were <HI>both</HI> in my power, and both of an age. And I &s;hould have this good rea&s;on for my preference: Your un|cle and I &s;hould have been too much alike, and &s;o been jealous of each other's wit; whereas I can make my hone&s;t Lord G. look about him, and admire me &s;trangely, whenever I plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But I am, it &s;eems, a per&s;on of a particular cha|racter. Every one, you &s;ay, loves me, yet blames me. Odd characters, my dear, are needful to make even characters &s;hine. You good girls would not be valued as you are, if there were not bad ones. Have
<PB N="227" REF="228">
you not heard it &s;aid, That all human excellence is but comparative? Pray allow of the contra&s;t. You, I am &s;ure, ought. You are an ungrateful creature, if, whenever you think of my over-liveline&s;&s;es, as you call 'em, you don't drop a courte&s;y, and &s;ay, You are obliged to me.</P>
<P>But &s;till the attack made upon you in your dre&s;&s;ing|room at Colnebrooke, by my &s;i&s;ter and me, &s;ticks in your &s;tomach&mdash;And why &s;o? We were willing to &s;hew you, that we were <HI>not</HI> the &s;illy people you mu&s;t have thought us, had we not been able to di&s;tingui&s;h light from darkne&s;s. You, who ever were, I believe&punc; one of the franke&s;t-hearted girls in Britain, and ad|mired for the ea&s;e and dignity given you by that frank|ne&s;s, were growing aukward, nay di&s;hone&s;t. Your gratitude! your gratitude! was the du&s;t you wanted to throw into our eyes, that we might not &s;ee that you were governed by a &s;tronger motive. You call|ed us your friends, your &s;i&s;ters, but treated us not as either; and this man, and that, and t'other, you could refu&s;e; and why? No rea&s;on given for it; and we were to be popt off with your gratitude, truly!&mdash;We were to believe ju&s;t what you &s;aid, and no more; nay, not &s;o much as you &s;aid. But we were not &s;o implicit. Nor would <HI>you,</HI> in our ca&s;e, have been &s;o.</P>
<P>But <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'you, perhaps, would not have violently bro|ken in upon a poor thing, who thought <HI>we</HI> were blind, becau&s;e &s;he was not willing we &s;hould &s;ee.'</Q>&mdash;May be not: But then, in that ca&s;e, we were hone&s;ter than you would have been; that's all. Here, &s;aid I, Lady L. is this poor girl aukwardly &s;truggling to con|ceal what every body &s;ees; and, &s;eeing, applauds her for, the men con&s;idered (Yes, Harriet, the man con|&s;idered; be plea&s;ed to take that in): Let us, in pity, relieve her. She is though to be frank, open-heart|ed, communicative; nay, &s;he pa&s;&s;es her&s;elf upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">in tho&s;e characters: She &s;ees we keep nothing from her.
<PB N="228" REF="229">
She has been acquainted with <HI>your</HI> Love before wed|lock; with <HI>my</HI> folly, in relation to Ander&s;on: She has carried her head above a &s;core or two of men not contemptible. She &s;its enthroned among <HI>us,</HI> while <HI>we</HI> make but common figures at her foot&s;tool: She calls us &s;i&s;ters, friends, and twenty pretty names. Let us acquaint her, that we &s;ee into her heart; and why Lord D. and others are &s;o indifferent with her. If &s;he is ingenuous, let us &s;pare her; if not, leave <HI>me</HI> to puni&s;h her&mdash;Yet we will keep up her punctilio as to our brother; we will leave him to make his own di&s;coveries. She may confide in his politene&s;s; and the re&s;ult will be happier for her; becau&s;e &s;he will then be under no re&s;traint to us, and her native free|dom of heart may again take its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Agreed, agreed, &s;aid Lady L.&mdash;And arm in arm, we entered your dre&s;&s;ing-room, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the maid, and began the attack&mdash;And, O Harriet! how you he|&s;itated, paraded, fooled on with us, before you came to confe&s;&s;ion! Indeed you de&s;erved not the mercy we &s;hewed you&mdash;So, child, you had better to have let this part of your &s;tory &s;leep in peace.</P>
<P>You bid me not tell Emily that your cou&s;in is in Love with her: But I think I will. Girls begin very early to look out for admirers. It is better, in order to &s;tay her &s;tomach, to find out one for her, than that &s;he &s;hould find out one for her&s;elf; e&s;pecially when the man is among our&s;elves, as I may &s;ay, and both are in our own management, and at di&s;tance from eath other. Emily is a good girl; but &s;he has &s;u&s;cep|tibilities already: And tho' I would not encourage her, as yet, to look out of her&s;elf for happine&s;s; yet I would give her con&s;equence with her&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time let her &s;ee, that there could be no men|tion made of any thing that related to <HI>her,</HI> but what &s;he &s;hould be acquainted with. Dear girl! I love her as well as you; and I pity her too: I or &s;he, as well as Somebody el&s;e, will have difficulties to contend
<PB N="229" REF="230">
with, which &s;he will not know ea&s;ily how to get over; tho' &s;he can, in a flame &s;o young, generou&s;ly prefer the intere&s;t of a more excellent woman to her own.&mdash;There, Harriet, is a grave paragraph: You'll like me for it.</P>
<P>You are a very reflecting girl, in mentioning to me &s;o particularly, your behaviour to your Grevilles, Fenwicks, and Ormes. What is that but &s;aying, See, Charlotte! I am a much more complai&s;ant creature to the men, no one of which I intend to have, than you are to your hu&s;band!</P>
<P>What a pious woman, indeed, mu&s;t be your grand|mamma, that &s;he could &s;u&s;pend her joy, her long|ab&s;ent darling at her feet, till &s;he had fir&s;t thank'd God for re&s;toring her to her arms! But, in this in|&s;tance, we &s;ee the force of habitual piety. Tho' not &s;o good as I &s;hould be my&s;elf, I revere tho&s;e who are &s;o; and that I hope you will own is no bad &s;ign.</P>
<P>Well, but now for our&s;elves, and tho&s;e about us.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia has written Lady L. a Letter from Wind&s;or. It is in French; extremely polite. She promi&s;es to write to me from Oxford.</P>
<P>Lady Anne S. made me a vi&s;it this morning. She was more concerned than I wi&s;hed to &s;ee her, on my confirming the report &s;he had heard of my brother's being gone abroad. I railled her a little too freely, as it was before Lord G. and Lord L. I never was better rebuked than by her; for &s;he took out her pencil, and on the cover of a letter wrote the&s;e lines from Shake&s;peare, and &s;lid them into my hand:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>And will you rend our ancient Love a&s;under,</L>
<L>To join with <HI>Men,</HI> in &s;corning your poor friend?</L>
<L>It is not friendly; 'tis not maidenly:</L>
<L>Our <HI>Sex,</HI> as well as I, may chide you for it,</L>
<L>Tho' I alone do feel the injury.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I never, my dear, told you how freely this Lady and I had talked of Love: But freely as we had talked,
<PB N="230" REF="231">
I was not aware that the matter lay &s;o deep in her heart. I knew not how to tell her that my brother had &s;aid, <HI>It could not be.</HI> I could have wept over her when I read this paper; and I owned my&s;elf by a whi&s;per ju&s;tly rebuked. She charged me not to let any man &s;ee this; particularly not either of tho&s;e pre&s;ent: And do <HI>you,</HI> Harriet, keep what I have written of Lady Anne to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>My aunt Eleanor has written a congratulatory Let|ter to me from York. Sir Charles, it &s;eems, had ac|quainted her with Lord G's day [Not my day, Har|riet! that is not the phra&s;e, I hope!] as &s;oon as he knew it him&s;elf; and &s;he writes, &s;uppo&s;ing that I was actually <HI>offered</HI> on it. Women are victims on the&s;e occa&s;ions: I hope you'll allow me that. My brother has made it a point of duty to acquaint his father's &s;i&s;ter with every matter of con&s;equence to the family; and now, &s;he &s;ays, that both her nieces are &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;he will come to town very quickly to &s;ee her new relations and us; and de&s;ires we will make room for her. And yet &s;he owns, that my brother has informed her of his being obliged to go abroad; and &s;he &s;uppo&s;es him gone. As he is the beloved of her heart, I wonder &s;he thinks of making this vi&s;it now he is ab&s;ent: But we &s;hall all be glad to &s;ee my aunt Nell. She is a good creature, tho' an old maid. I hope the old Lady has not utterly lo&s;t either her in|vention, or memory; and then, between both, I &s;hall be entertained with a great number of Love-&s;tories of the la&s;t age; and perhaps of &s;ome dangers and e&s;capes; which may &s;erve for warnings for Emily. Alas! alas! they will come too late for your Charlotte!</P>
<P>I have written already the longe&s;t Letter that I ever wrote in my life: Yet it is prating; and to you, to whom I love to prate. I have not near done.</P>
<P>You bid me be good; and you threaten me, if I am not, with the ill opinion of all your friends: But I have &s;uch an unaccountable bia&s;s for roguery, or what
<PB N="231" REF="232">
&s;hall I call it? that I believe it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to take your advice. I have been examining my&s;elf. What a duce is the matter with me, that I cannot &s;ee my hone&s;t man in the &s;ame advantageous light in which he appears to every body el&s;e? Yet I do not, in my heart, di&s;like him. On the contrary, I know not, were I to look about me, far and wide, the man I would have wi&s;hed to have called mine, rather than him. But he is &s;o important about trifles; &s;o nimble, yet &s;o &s;low: He is &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his own <HI>intention</HI> to plea&s;e, and has &s;o many antic motions in his obliging|ne&s;s; that I cannot forbear laughing at the very time that I ought perhaps to reward him with a gracious approbation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fool on a little while longer, I believe: Per|mit me, Harriet, &s;o to do, as occa&s;ions ari&s;e.</P>
<P>AN in&s;tance, an in&s;tance in point, Harriet. Let me laugh as I write. I did it at the time.&mdash;What do you laugh at, Charlotte?&mdash;Why this poor man, or, as I &s;hould rather &s;ay, this Lord and Ma&s;ter of mine, has ju&s;t left me. He has been making me both a compliment, and a pre&s;ent. And what do you think the compliment is? Why&punc; if I plea&s;e, he will give away to a virtuo&s;o friend, his collection of Moths and Butterflies: I once, he remember'd, raillied him upon them. And by what &s;tudy, thought I, wilt thou, hone&s;t man, &s;upply their place? If thou ha&s;t a talent this way, pur&s;ue it; &s;ince perhaps thou wilt not &s;hine in any other. And the <HI>be&s;t</HI> any-thing, you know, Harriet, carries with it the appearance of excellence. Nay, he would al&s;o part with his collection of Shells, if I had no objection.</P>
<P>To whom, my Lord?&mdash;He had not re&s;olved.&mdash;Why then, only as Emily is too little of a child, or you might give them to her. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Too little of a child, madam?'</Q> and a great deal of bu&s;tle and importance took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his features&mdash;Let me tell you, ma|dam&mdash;I <HI>won't</HI> let you, my Lord; and I laughed.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">
Well, madam, I hope here is &s;omething coming up that you will not di&s;dain to accept of your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Up came groaning under the weight, or rather un|der the <HI>care,</HI> two &s;ervants with ba&s;kets: A fine &s;et of old Japan China with brown edges, believe me. They &s;at down their ba&s;kets, and withdrew.</P>
<P>Would you not have been delighted, Harriet, to &s;ee my Lord bu&s;ying him&s;elf with taking out, and put|ting in the windows, one at a time, the cups, plates, jars, and &s;aucers, rejoicing and parading over them, and &s;hewing his connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip to his motionle&s;s ad|miring wife, in commending this and the other piece as a beauty? And, when he had done, taking the <HI>li|berty,</HI> as he phra&s;ed it, half fearful, half re&s;olute, to &s;alute his bride for his reward; and then pacing back|wards &s;everal &s;teps with &s;uch a &s;trut and a crow&mdash;I &s;ee him yet!&mdash;Indulge me, Harriet!&mdash;I bur&s;t into a hearty laugh; I could not help it: And he, reddening, looked round him&s;elf, and round him&s;elf, to &s;ee if any thing was ami&s;s in his garb. The man, the man! hone&s;t friend, I could have &s;aid, but had too much reverence for my hu&s;band, is the oddity! Nothing ami&s;s in the garb.</P>
<P>O Harriet! Why did you be&s;eech me to be good? I think in my heart I have the &s;tronger inclination to be bad for it! You call me <HI>perver&s;e;</HI> if you think me &s;o, bid me be &s;aucy, bid me be bad; and I may then, like other good wives, take the contrary cour&s;e for the &s;ake of dear contradiction.</P>
<P>Shew not, however, (I in turn be&s;eech <HI>you)</HI> to your grandmamma and aunt, &s;uch parts of this Letter as would make them de&s;pi&s;e me. You &s;ay, you &s;tand up for me; I have need of your advocate&s;hip: Never let me want it. And do I not, after all, do a greater credit to my good man, when I can &s;o heartily laugh in the wedded &s;tate, than if I were to &s;it down with my finger in my eye?</P>
<P>I have taken your advice, and pre&s;ented my &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="233" REF="234">
with my half of the jewels. I de&s;ired her to accept them, as they were my mother's, and for her &s;ake. This gave them a value with her, more than equal with their worth: But Lord L. is unea&s;y, and declares he will not &s;uffer Lady L. long to lie under the obli|gation. Were every one of family in South Britain and North Britain to be as generous and di&s;intere&s;ted as Lord L. and our family, the union of the two parts of the i&s;land would be complete.</P>
<P>LORD help this poor obliging man! I wi&s;h I don't love him at la&s;t. He has taken my hint, and has pre&s;ented his collection of Shells (a very &s;ine one, he &s;ays, it is) to Emily; and they two are actually bu&s;i|ed (and will be for an hour or two, I doubt not) in admiring them; the one &s;trutting over the beauties, in order to enhance the value of the pre&s;ent; the other courte&s;ying ten times in a minute, to &s;hew her gra|titude. Poor man! When his virtuo&s;o friend has got his Butterflies and Moths, I am afraid he mu&s;t &s;et up a turner's &s;hop for employment. If he loved reading, I could, when our vi&s;iting hours are over, &s;et him to read to me the new things that come out, while I knot or work; and, i&s; he loved writing, to copy the Let|ters which pa&s;s between you and me, and tho&s;e for you which I expect with &s;o much impatience from my brother by means of Dr Bartlett. I think he &s;pells pretty well, for a Lord.</P>
<P>I have no more to &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, but compli|ments, without number or mea&s;ure, to all you &s;o de|&s;ervedly love and honour; as well tho&s;e I have not &s;een, as tho&s;e I have.</P>
<P>One thing: Reveal to me all the &s;ecrets of your heart, and how that heart is from time to time af|fected; that I may know whether you are capable of that greatne&s;s of mind in a love-ca&s;e, that you &s;hew in all others. We will all allow you to love Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Tho&s;e who do, give honour to them|&s;elves,

<P>Let me know every thing how and about your fel|lows, too. Ah! Harriet, you make not the u&s;e of power that I would have done in your &s;ituation.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, May <HI>1.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O MY deare&s;t, my honoured Mi&s;s Byron, how you have &s;hamed your Emily by &s;ending a Letter to her; &s;uch a &s;weet Letter too! before I have paid my duty to you, in a Letter of thanks for all your love to me, and for all your kind in&s;tructions. But I began once, twice, and thrice, and wrote a great deal each time, but could not plea&s;e my&s;elf: You, madam, are <HI>&s;uch</HI> a writer, and I am &s;uch a <HI>poor thing</HI> at my pen!&mdash;But I know you will accept the heart. And &s;o my very di&s;&s;idence &s;hews pride; &s;ince it cannot be ex|pected from me to be a fine writer: And yet this very Letter, I fore&s;ee, will be the wor&s;e for my diffidence, and not the better: For I don't like this beginning, neither.&mdash;But come, it &s;hall go. Am I not u&s;ed to
<PB N="235" REF="236">
your goodne&s;s? And do you not bid me prattle to you, in my Letters, as I u&s;ed to do in your dre&s;&s;ing|room? O what &s;weet advice have you, and do you return for my &s;illy prate! And &s;o I will begin.</P>
<P>And was you grieved at parting with your Emily on Saturday morning? I am &s;ure I was very much concerned at parting with you. I could not help cry|ing all the way to town; and Lady G. &s;hed tears as well as I, and &s;o did Lady L. &s;everal times; and &s;aid, You were the lovelie&s;t, be&s;t young Lady in the world. And we all prai&s;ed likewi&s;e your aunt, your cou&s;in Lucy, and young Mr. Selby. How good are all your relations! They mu&s;t be good! And Lord L. and Lord G. for <HI>men,</HI> were as much concerned as we, at parting with you. Mr. Reeves was &s;o dull all the way! poor Mr. Reeves, he was very dull. And Mr. Beauchamp, he prai&s;ed you to the very &s;kies; and in &s;uch a pretty manner too! Next to my guardian, I think Mr. Beauchamp is a very agreeable man. I fan&s;y the&s;e noble &s;i&s;ters, if the truth were known, don't like him &s;o well as their brother does: Perhaps that may be the rea&s;on, out of jealou&s;y, as I may &s;ay, if there be any thing in my ob&s;ervation. But they are va&s;tly civil to him, neverthele&s;s&punc; yet they never prai&s;e him when his back is turned, as they do others, who can't &s;ay half the good things that he &s;ays.</P>
<P>Well, but enough of Mr. Beauchamp. My guar|dian! my gracious, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> my indulgent guar|dian! who, that thinks of him, can prai&s;e any body el&s;e!</P>
<P>O madam! Where is he now? God protect and guide my guardian, where-ever he goes! This is my prayer, fir&s;t and la&s;t, and I can't tell how often in the day. I look for him in every place I have &s;een him in (And pray tell me, madam, Did not you do &s;o when he had left us?); and when I can't find him, I do <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;igh!&mdash;What a plea&s;ure, yet what a pain, is there in &s;ighing, when I think of him! Yet I know I
<PB N="236" REF="237">
am an innocent girl. And this I am &s;ure of, that I wi&s;h him to be the hu&s;band of but one woman in the whole world; and that is you. But then my next wi&s;h is&mdash;You know what&mdash;Ah my Mi&s;s Byron! you mu&s;t let me live with you and my guardian, if you &s;hould ever be Lady Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>But here, madam, are &s;ad doings &s;ometimes, be|tween Lord and Lady G. I am very angry at her often in my heart; yet I cannot help laughing, now|and then, at her out-of-the-way &s;ayings. Is not her character a very new one? Or are there more &s;uch young wives? I could not do as &s;he does, were I to be queen of the globe. Every-body blames her. She will make my Lord not love her at la&s;t. Don't you think &s;o? And then what will &s;he get by her wit?</P>
<P>JUST this moment &s;he came into my clo&s;et&mdash;Writing, Emily? &s;aid &s;he: To whom?&mdash;I told her.&mdash;Don't tell tales out of &s;chool, Emily.&mdash;I was <HI>&s;o</HI> afraid that &s;he would have a&s;ked to &s;ee what I had written: But &s;he did not. To be &s;ure &s;he is very polite, and knows what belongs to her&s;elf, and every-body el&s;e: To be ungenerous, as you once &s;aid, to her hu&s;band only, that is a very &s;ad thing to think of.</P>
<P>Well, and I would give any-thing to know if you think what I have written tolerable, before I go any farther: But I will go on in this way, &s;ince I cannot do better. Bad is my be&s;t; but you &s;hall have quan|tity, I warrant, &s;ince you bid me write long Let|ters.</P>
<P>But I have &s;een my mother: It was but ye&s;terday. She was in a mercer's &s;hop in Covent-Garden. I was in Lord L.'s chariot; only Anne was with me. Anne &s;aw her fir&s;t. I alighted, and a&s;ked her ble&s;&s;ing in the &s;hop: I am &s;ure I did right. She ble&s;&s;ed me, and called me dear love. I &s;tay'd till &s;he had bought what &s;he wanted, and then I &s;lid down the money, as
<PB N="237" REF="238">
if it were her own doing; and glad I was I had &s;o much about me: It came but to four guineas. I begged her, &s;peaking low, to forgive me for &s;o doing: And finding &s;he was to go home as far as Soho, and had thoughts of having a hackney-coach called; I gave Anne money for a coach for her&s;elf, and waited on my mother to her own lodgings; and it being Lord L.'s chariot, &s;he was &s;o good as to di&s;pen&s;e with my alighting.</P>
<P>She ble&s;&s;ed my guardian all the way, and ble&s;&s;ed me. She &s;aid, &s;he would not a&s;k me to come to &s;ee her, becau&s;e it might not be thought proper, as my guardian was abroad: But &s;he hoped, &s;he might be al|lowed to come and &s;ee me &s;ometimes.&mdash;Was &s;he not very good, madam? But my guardian's goodne&s;s makes every-body good.&mdash;O that my mamma had been always the &s;ame! I &s;hould have been but too happy!</P>
<P>God ble&s;s my guardian, for putting me on enlarging her power to live hand&s;omely. Only as a coach brings on other charges, and people mu&s;t live accord|ingly, or be di&s;credited, in&s;tead of credited, by it; or I &s;hould hope the additional Two hundred a year might afford them one. Yet one does not know but Mr. O Hara may have been in debt before he married her; and I fan&s;y he has people who hang upon him. But if it plea&s;es God, I will not, when I am at age, and have a coach of my own, &s;uffer my mother to walk on foot. What a ble&s;&s;ing is it, to have a guardian that will &s;econd every good purpo&s;e of one's heart!</P>
<P>Lady Olivia is rambling about; and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will wait here in England till Sir Charles's return: But I am &s;ure he never will have her. A wicked wretch, with her poniards! Yet it is pity! She is a fine woman. But I hate her for her expectation, as well as for her poniard. And a woman to leave her own country, to &s;eek for a hu&s;band! I could die be|fore I could do &s;o; tho' to &s;uch a man as my guardian.
<PB N="238" REF="239">
Yet once I thought I could have liked to have lived with her at Florence. She has &s;ome good qualities, and is very generous, and in the main well e&s;teemed in her own country; every-body knew &s;he loved my guardian: But I don't know how it is; nobody blamed her for it, va&s;t as the difference in fortune then was. But that is the glory of being a virtuous man; to love him is a credit, in&s;tead of a &s;hame. O madam! Who would not be virtuous? And that not only for their own, but for their friends &s;akes, if they loved their friends, and wi&s;hed them to be well thought of?</P>
<P>Lord W. is very de&s;irous to ha&s;ten his wedding.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp &s;ays, that all the Mansfields (He knows them) ble&s;s my guardian every day of their lives; and their enemies tremble. He has commi&s;|&s;ions from my guardian to enquire and act in their cau&s;e, that no time may be lo&s;t to do them &s;ervice, again&s;t his return.</P>
<P>We have had another vi&s;it from Lady Beauchamp, and have returned it. She is very much plea&s;ed with us: You &s;ee I &s;ay <HI>us.</HI> Indeed my two dear Ladies are very good to me; but I have no merit: It is all for their brother's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp tells us, ju&s;t now, that his mother-in-law has joined with his father, at her own motion, to &s;ettle 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year upon him. I am glad of it, with all my heart: Are not you? He is all gratitude upon it. He &s;ays, that he will redouble his endea|vours to oblige her; and that his gratitude to her, as well as his duty to his father, will engage his utmo&s;t regard for her.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp, Sir Harry him&s;elf, and my Lady, are continually ble&s;&s;ing my guardian: Every-body, in &s;hort, ble&s;&s;es him.&mdash;But, ah! madam, Where is he, at this moment? O that I were a bird! that I might hover over his head, and &s;ometimes bring tidings to his friends of his motions and good deeds. I would
<PB N="239" REF="240">
often flap my wings, dear Mi&s;s Byron, at your chamber-window, as a &s;ignal of his welfare, and then fly back again, and perch as near him as I could.</P>
<P>I am very happy, as I &s;aid before, in the favour of Lady and Lord L. and Lady and Lord G.; but I never &s;hall be &s;o happy, as when I had the addition of your charming company. I mi&s;s you and my guar|dian: O how I mi&s;s you both! But, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, love me not the le&s;s, tho' now I have put pen to paper, and you &s;ee what a poor creature I am in my writing. Many a one, I believe, may be thought to|lerable in conver&s;ation; but when they are &s;o &s;illy as to put pen to paper, they expo&s;e them&s;elves; as I have done, in this long piece of &s;cribble. But accept it, neverthele&s;s, for the true love I bear you; and truer love never flamed in any bo&s;om, to any one the mo&s;t dearly beloved, than does in mine for you.</P>

Greatne&s;s of mind!'</Q>&mdash;I don't know what it is!&mdash;All his excel|lencies, his greatne&s;s, his goodne&s;s, his mode&s;ty, his chearfulne&s;s under &s;uch afflictions as would weigh down every other heart that had but half the com|pa&s;&s;ion in it with which his overflows&mdash;Mu&s;t not all other men appear little, and, le&s;s than little, nothing, in my eyes?&mdash;It is an in&s;tance of patience in me, that I can endure any of them who pretend to regard me out of my own family.</P>
<P>I thought, that when I got down to my dear friends here, I &s;hould be better enabled, by their prudent coun&s;els, to attain the de&s;ireable frame of mind which I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf: But I find my&s;elf mi&s;taken. My grandmamma and aunt are &s;uch admirers of him, take &s;uch a &s;hare in the di&s;appointment, that their ad|vice has not the effect I had hoped it would have. Lucy, Nancy, are perpetually calling upon me to tell them &s;omething of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and when I begin, I know not how to leave off. My uncle raillies me, laughs at me, &s;ometimes reminds me of what he calls my former brags. I did not brag, my dear: I only hoped, that re&s;pecting as I did <HI>every</HI> man according to his merit, I &s;hould never be greatly taken with <HI>any</HI> one, before duty added force to the in|clination. Methinks the company of the friends I am with, does not &s;atisfy me; yet they never were dearer to me than they now are. I want to have Lord and Lady L. Lord and Lady G. Dr. Bartlett, my Emily, with me. To lo&s;e you all at once!&mdash;is hard! There &s;eems to be a &s;tranger void in my heart&mdash;And &s;o much, at pre&s;ent, for the &s;tate of that heart.</P>
<P>I always had rea&s;on to think my&s;elf greatly obliged to my friends and neighbours all around us; but ne|ver, till my return, after the&s;e few months ab&s;ence, knew how much. So many kind vi&s;iters; &s;uch un|affected expre&s;&s;ions of joy on my return; that had I
<PB N="241" REF="242">
not a very great counterbalance on my heart, would be enough to make me proud.</P>
<P>My grandmamma went to Shirley manor on Sa|turday; on Monday I was with her all day: But &s;he would have it that I &s;hould be melancholy if I &s;taid with her. And &s;he is <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;elf-denyingly careful of her Harriet! There never was a more noble heart in woman. But her <HI>&s;olitary</HI> moments, as my uncle calls them, are her Moments of joy. And why? Becau&s;e &s;he then dive&s;ts her&s;elf of all that is either painful or plea&s;urable to her in this life: For &s;he &s;ays, that her cares for her Harriet, and e&s;pecially <HI>now,</HI> are at lea&s;t a balance for the delights &s;he takes in her.</P>
<P>You command me to acquaint you with what pa&s;&s;es between me and the gentlemen in my neighbourhood; in your &s;tile, <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fellows.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick invited him&s;elf to breakfa&s;t with my aunt Selby ye&s;terday morning. I would not avoid him.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with the particulars: You know well enough what men will &s;ay on the &s;ubject upon which you will &s;uppo&s;e he wanted to talk to me. He was extremely earne&s;t. I be&s;ought him to accept my thanks for his good opinion of me, as all the re|turn I could make him for it; and this in &s;o very &s;e|rious a manner, that my heart was fretted, when he declared, with warmth his determined per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville made us a tea-vi&s;it in the afternoon. My uncle and he joined to railly us poor women, as u&s;ual. I left the defence of the Sex to my aunt and Lucy. How poor appears to me every conver&s;ation now with the&s;e men!&mdash;But hold, &s;aucy Harriet&punc; was not your Uncle Selby one of the railliers?&mdash;But he does not believe all he &s;ays; and therefore cannot wi&s;h to be &s;o much regarded, on this topic, as he ought to be by me, on others.</P>
<P>After the run of raillery was over, in which Mr. Greville made exceptions favourable to the women
<PB N="242" REF="243">
pre&s;ent, he applied to every one for their intere&s;t with me, and to me to countenance his addre&s;s. He &s;et forth his preten&s;ions very pompou&s;ly, and mentioned a very con&s;iderable increa&s;e of his fortune; which be|fore was a very hand&s;ome one. He offered our own terms. He declared his love for me above all women, and made his happine&s;s in the next world, as well as in this, depend upon my favour to him.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to an&s;wer all he &s;aid; and is equally &s;o for you to gue&s;s in what manner I an&s;wered him: And he, finding me determined, began to grow ve|hement, and even affrontive. He hinted to me, that he knew what had made me &s;o very re&s;olute. He threw out threatnings again&s;t the man, be he whom he would, that &s;hould &s;tand in the way of his &s;ucce&s;s with me; at the &s;ame time intimating &s;aucily, as I may &s;ay (for his manner had in&s;ult in it) that it was impo&s;&s;ible a certain event could ever take place.</P>
<P>My uncle was angry with him; &s;o was my aunt: Lucy was &s;till more angry than they: But I, &s;tanding up, &s;aid, Pray, my dear friends, take nothing ami&s;s that Mr. Greville has &s;aid.&mdash;He once told me, that he would &s;et &s;pies upon my conduct in town. If, Sir, your &s;pies have been ju&s;t, I fear nothing they can &s;ay. But the hints you have thrown out, &s;hew &s;uch a total want of all delicacy of mind, that you mu&s;t not won|der if my <HI>heart</HI> rejects you. Yet I am not angry: I reproach you not: every one has his peculiar way. All that is left me to &s;ay or to do, is to thank you for your favourable opinion of me, as I have thanked Mr. Fenwick; and to de&s;ire that you will allow me to look upon you as my neighbour, and <HI>only</HI> as my neighbour.</P>
<P>I courte&s;ied to him and withdrew.</P>
<P>But my great difficulty had been before with Mr. Orme. His &s;i&s;ter had de&s;ired that I would &s;ee her brother. He and &s;he were invited by my aunt to din|ner on Tue&s;day. They came. Poor man! He is
<PB N="243" REF="244">
not well! I am &s;orry for it. Poor Mr. Orme is not well! He made me &s;uch <HI>hone&s;t</HI> compliments&punc; as I may &s;ay: His <HI>heart</HI> was too much in his civilities to rai&s;e them above the civilities that ju&s;tice and truth might warrant in favour of a per&s;on highly e&s;teemed. Mine was filled with compa&s;&s;ion for him; and that compa&s;&s;ion would have &s;hewn it&s;elf in tokens of ten|derne&s;s, more than once, had I not re&s;trained my&s;elf for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake. How you, my dear Lady G. can delight in giving pain to an hone&s;t heart, I cannot imagine. I would make all God Almighty's creatures happy, if I could; and &s;o would your noble brother. Is he not cro&s;&s;ing dangerous &s;eas, and a&s;cending through almo&s;t perpetual &s;nows, tho&s;e dreadful Alps which I have heard de&s;cribed with &s;uch terror, for the generous end of relieving di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>I made Mr. Orme &s;it next me. I was a&s;&s;iduous to help him, and to do him all the little offices which I thought would light up plea&s;ure in his mode&s;t counte|nance; and he was quite another man. It gave de|light to his &s;i&s;ter, and to all my friends, to &s;ee him &s;mile, and look happy. I think, my dear Lady G. that when Mr. Orme looks plea&s;ant, and at ea&s;e, he re&s;embles a little the good-natured Lord G.&mdash;O that you would take half the pains to oblige him, that I do to relieve Mr. Orme!&mdash;<HI>Half the pains,</HI> did I &s;ay? That you would not take pains to <HI>di&s;</HI>-oblige him; and he would be, of cour&s;e, obliged. Don't be afraid, my dear, that in &s;uch a world as this, things will not happen to make you unea&s;y, without your &s;tudying for them. Excu&s;e my &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s: I am indeed <HI>too</HI> &s;erious at times.</P>
<P>But when Mr. Orme reque&s;ted a few minutes au|dience of me, as he called it, and I walked with him into the cedar parlour, which you have heard me mention, and with which I hope you will be one day acquainted; he paid, poor man! for his too tran|&s;ient
<PB N="244" REF="245">
plea&s;ure. Why would he urge a denial that he could not but know I mu&s;t give?</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter and I had afterwards a conference. She pleaded too &s;trongly her brother's health, and even his life; both which, &s;he would have it, depended on my favour to him. I was greatly affected; and at la&s;t be&s;ought her, if &s;he valued my friend&s;hip as I did hers, never more to mention to me a &s;ubject which gave me a pain too &s;en&s;ible for my peace.</P>
<P>She reque&s;ted me to a&s;&s;ure her, that neither Mr. Greville, nor Mr. Fenwick, might be the man. They both took upon them, &s;he &s;aid, to ridicule her brother for the profound re&s;pect, even to reverence, that he bore me; which, if he knew, might be at|tended with con&s;equences: For that her brother, mild and gentle as was his pa&s;&s;ion for me, had cou|rage to re&s;ent any indignities that might be ca&s;t upon him by &s;pirits boi&s;terous as were tho&s;e of the two gen|tlemen &s;he had named. She never, therefore, told her brother of their &s;coffs. But it would go to her heart, if either of them &s;hould &s;ucceed, or have rea&s;on but for a di&s;tant hope.</P>
<P>I made her heart ea&s;y on that &s;core.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now heard that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen is come from abroad already. What can be the meaning of it? He is &s;o low-minded, &s;o malicious a man, and I have &s;uffered &s;o much from him&mdash;What can be the meaning of his &s;udden return? I am told, that he is actually in London. Pray, my dear Lady G. inform your&s;elf about him; and whether he thinks of coming into the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, when he met us at Stony-Stratford, threw out menaces again&s;t Sir Hargrave, on my ac|count; and &s;aid, It was well he was gone abroad. I told him then, that he had no bu&s;ine&s;s, even were Sir Hargrave pre&s;ent, to engage him&s;elf in my quar|rels.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246">
Mr. Greville is an impetuous man; a man of rough manners; and makes many people afraid of him. He has, I believe, <HI>indeed,</HI> had his &s;pies about me; for he &s;eems to know every-thing that has befallen me in my ab&s;ence from Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He has dared al&s;o to threaten Somebody el&s;e. In|&s;olent wretch! But he hinted to me ye&s;terday, that he was exceedingly plea&s;ed with the news, that a certain gentleman was gone abroad, in order to pro&s;ecute a <HI>former amour,</HI> was the light wretch's as light expre&s;|&s;ion. If my indignant eyes could have killed him, he would have fallen dead at my feet.</P>
<P>Let the con&s;tant and true re&s;pects of all my friends to you and yours, and to my beloved Emily, be al|ways, for the future, con&s;idered as very affectionately expre&s;&s;ed, whether the variety of other &s;ubjects leaves room for a particular expre&s;&s;ion of them, or not, by, my deare&s;t Lady G.</P>

<P>I Thank you, Harriet, for yours. What mu&s;t your fellows think of you? In this gro&s;s age, your de|licacy mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h them. There u&s;ed to be more of it formerly. But how &s;hould men know any-thing of it, when women have forgot it? Lord be thanked, we females, &s;ince we have been admitted into &s;o con|&s;tant a &s;hare of the public diver&s;ions, want not cou|rage. We can give the men &s;tare for &s;tare where|ever we meet them. The next age, nay, the ri&s;ing generation, mu&s;t &s;urely be all heroes and heroines. But whither has this word <HI>delicacy</HI> carried me? Me, who, it &s;eems, have faults to be corrected for of an|other
<PB N="246" REF="247">
&s;ort; and who want not the <HI>courage</HI> for which I congratulate others?</P>
<P>But to other &s;ubjects&punc; I could write a va&s;t deal of &s;tuff about my Lord and Self, and Lord and Lady L. who a&s;&s;ume parts which I know not how to allow them: And &s;ometimes they threaten me with my bro|ther's re&s;entments, &s;ometimes with my Harriet's; &s;o that I mu&s;t really have leading-&s;trings fa&s;tened to my &s;houlders. O my dear! a fond hu&s;band is a &s;urfeit|ing thing; and yet I believe mo&s;t women love to be made monkeys of.</P>
<P>BUT all other &s;ubjects mu&s;t now give way. We have heard <HI>of,</HI> tho' not <HI>from,</HI> my brother. A particular friend of Mr. Lowther was here with a Letter from that gentleman, acquainting us, that Sir Charles and he were arrived at Paris.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp was with us when Mr. Lowther's friend came. He borrowed the Letter on account of the extraordinary adventure mentioned in it.</P>
<P>Make your heart ea&s;y, in the fir&s;t place, about Sir Hargrave. He is indeed in town; but very ill. He was frighted into England, and intends not ever again to quit it. In all probability, he owes it to my brother that he exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp went directly to Cavendi&s;h Square, and informed him&s;elf there of other particulars re|lating to the affair, from the very &s;ervant who was pre|&s;ent and acting in it; and from tho&s;e particulars and Mr. Lowther's Letter, wrote one for Dr. Bartlett. Mr. Beauchamp obliged me with the peru&s;al of what he wrote; whence I have extracted the following ac|count: For his Letter is long and circum&s;tantial; and I did not a&s;k his leave to take a copy, as he &s;eemed de&s;irous to ha&s;ten it to the doctor.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 19/30 of April, in the evening, as my brother was pur&s;uing his journey to Paris, and was
<PB N="247" REF="248">
within two miles of that capital, a &s;ervant-man rode up, in vi&s;ible terror, to his po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which were Mr. Lowther and him&s;elf, and be&s;ought them to hear his dreadful tale. The gentlemen &s;topt, and he told them, that his ma&s;ter, who was an Engli&s;hman, and his friend of the &s;ame nation, had been but a little while before attacked, and forced out of the road in their po&s;t-chai&s;e, as he doubted not, to be murdered, by no le&s;s than &s;even armed hor&s;emen; and he pointed to a hill, at di&s;tance, called Mont Martre, behind which they were, at that moment, perpetrating their bloody purpo&s;e. He had ju&s;t before, he &s;aid, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to two other gentlemen, and their reti|nue, who drove on the fa&s;ter for it.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant's great coat was open; and Sir Charles ob&s;erving his livery, a&s;ked him, If he were not a &s;er|vant of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen? and was an&s;wered in the affirmative.</P>
<P>There are, it &s;eems, trees planted on each &s;ide the road from St. Denis to Paris, but which, as France is an open and uninclo&s;ed country, would not, but for the hill, have hindered the &s;eeing a great way off, the &s;cuffling of &s;o many men on hor&s;eback. There is al|&s;o a ditch on either hand; but places left for owners to come at their grounds, with their carts, and other carriages. Sir Charles ordered the po&s;t-boy to drive to one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s; ges; &s;aying, He could not for|give him&s;elf, if he did not endeavour to &s;ave Sir Har|grave, and his friend, who&s;e name the man told him was Merceda.</P>
<P>His own &s;ervants were three in number, be&s;ides one of Mr. Lowther. My brother made Mr. Low|ther's &s;ervant di&s;mount; and, getting him&s;elf on his hor&s;e, ordered the others to follow him. He begged Mr. Lowther to continue in the chai&s;e, bidding the di&s;mounted &s;ervant &s;tay, and attend his ma&s;ter, and galloped a way towards the hill. His ears were &s;oon pierced with the cries of the poor wretches; and
<PB N="248" REF="249">
pre&s;ently he &s;aw two men on hor&s;eback holding the hor&s;es of four others, who had under them the two gentlemen, &s;truggling, groaning, and crying out for mercy.</P>
<P>On the approach of Sir Charles, who was a good way a-head of his &s;ervants, he calling out to &s;pare the gentlemen, and bending his cour&s;e to relieve the pro|&s;trate &s;ufferers, two of the four quitted their prey, and mounting, joined the other two hor&s;emen, and ad|vanced to meet Sir Charles, with a &s;hew of &s;upport|ing the two men on foot in their violence; who con|tinued laying on the wretches, with the but-ends of their whips, unmercifully.</P>
<P>As the a&s;&s;ailants offered not to fly, and as they had more than time enough to execute their purpo&s;e, had it been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">obbery and murder; Sir Charles concluded, it was likely that the&s;e men were actuated by a private revenge. He was confirmed in this &s;urmi&s;e, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">our men on hor&s;eback, tho' each had his pi&s;tol ready drawn, as Sir Charles al&s;o had his, demanded a conference; warning Sir Charles how he provoked his fate by his ra&s;hne&s;s; and declaring, that he was a dead man if he fired.</P>
<P>Forbear, then, &s;aid Sir Charles, all further violences to the gentlemen, and I will hear what you have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>He then put his pi&s;tol into his hol&s;ter; and one of his &s;ervants being come up, and the two others at hand (to whom he called out, not to fire till they had his orders), he gave him his hor&s;e's reins; bidding him have an eye to the hol&s;ters of both, and leapt down; and, drawing his &s;word, made towards the two men who were &s;o cruelly exerci&s;ing their whips; and who, on his approach, retired to &s;ome little di&s;tance, drawing their hangers.</P>
<P>The four men on hor&s;eback joined the two on foot, ju&s;t as they were quitting the objects of their fury; and one of them &s;aid, Forbear, for the pre&s;ent, fur|ther
<PB N="249" REF="250">
violence, brother; the gentleman, &s;hall be told the cau&s;e of all this.&mdash;Murder, Sir, &s;aid he, is not in|tended; nor are we robbers: The men whom you are &s;olicitous to &s;ave from our vengeance, are vil|lains.</P>
<P>Be the cau&s;e what it will, an&s;wered Sir Charles, you are in a country noted for doing <HI>&s;pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> ju&s;tice, upon proper application to the magi&s;trates. In the &s;ame in&s;tant he rai&s;ed fir&s;t one groaning man, then the other. Their heads were all over bloody, and they were &s;o much brui&s;ed, that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats, which l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y near them; nor put them on without Sir Charles's help.</P>
<P>The men on foot by this time had mounted their hor&s;es, and all fix &s;tood upon their defence; but one of them was &s;o furious, crying out, that his vengeance &s;hould be yet more complete, that two of the others could hardly re&s;train him.</P>
<P>Sir Charles a&s;ked Sir Hargrave and Mr. Merceda, Whether they had rea&s;on to look upon them&s;elves as injured men, or injurers? One of the a&s;&s;ailants an|&s;wered, That they both knew them&s;elves to be vil|lains.</P>
<P>Either from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or terror, perhaps from both, they could not &s;peak for them&s;elves, but by groans; nor could either of them &s;tand or &s;it up|right.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came up, in the chai&s;e, Mr. Lowther and his &s;ervant, each a pi&s;tol in his hand. He quitted the chai&s;e, when he came near the &s;uffering men; and Sir Charles de&s;ired him in&s;tantly to examine whether the gentlemen were dangerou&s;ly hurt, or not.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t enraged of the a&s;&s;ailants, having &s;lipt by the two who were earne&s;t to re&s;train him, would again have attacked Mr. Merceda; offering a &s;troke at him with his hanger: But Sir Charles (his drawn &s;word &s;till in his hand) caug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t hold of his hand and, turning his hor&s;e's head a&s;ide, diverted a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="250" REF="251">
which, in all probability, would otherwi&s;e have been a fini&s;hing one.</P>
<P>They all came about Sir Charles, bidding him, at his peril, u&s;e his &s;word upon their friend: And Sir Charles's &s;ervants were coming up to their ma&s;ter's &s;upport, had there b en occa&s;ion. At that in&s;tant Mr. Lowther, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his own &s;ervant, was exa|mining the wounds and brui&s;es of the two terrified men, who had yet no rea&s;on to think them&s;elves &s;afe from further violence.</P>
<P>Sir Charles repeatedly commanded his &s;ervants not to fire, nor approach nearer, without his orders. The per&s;ons, &s;aid he, to the a&s;&s;ailants, whom you have &s;o cruelly u&s;ed, are Engli&s;hmen of condition I will pro|tect them. Be the provocation what it will, you mu&s;t know that your attempt upon them is a criminal one; and if my friend la&s;t come up, who is a very &s;kilful &s;urgeon, &s;hall pronounce them in danger, you &s;hall find it &s;o. Still he held the hor&s;e of the furious one; and three of them, who &s;eemed to be principals, were beginning to expre&s;s &s;ome re&s;entment at this cavalier treatment, when Mr. Lowther gave his opinion, that there was no apparent danger of death: And then Sir Charles, quitting the man's bridle, and putting him|&s;elf between the a&s;&s;ailants and &s;ufferers, &s;aid, That as they had not either offered to fly, or to be guilty of violence to him&s;elf, his friend, or &s;ervants; he was afraid they had &s;ome rea&s;on to think them&s;elves ill u&s;ed by the gentlemen. But, however, as they could not &s;uppo&s;e they were at liberty, in a civilized country, to take their revenge on the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who were intitled to the protection of that country; he &s;hould expect, that they would hold them&s;elves to be per&s;o|nally an&s;werable for their conduct at a proper tribu|nal.</P>
<P>The villains, one of the men &s;aid, knew who they were, and what the provocation was; which had me|rited a wor&s;e treatment than they had hitherto met
<PB N="251" REF="252">
with. You, Sir, proceeded he, &s;eem to be a man of honour, and temper: We are men of honour, as well as you. Our de&s;ign, as we told you, was not to kill the mi&s;creants; but to give them rea&s;on to re|member their villainy as long as they lived; and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like. They have made a vile attempt, continued he, on a Lady's honour at Abbeville; and, finding them&s;elves detected, and in danger, had taken round-about ways, and &s;hifted from one vehicle to another, to e&s;cape the vengeance of her friends. The gentleman who&s;e hor&s;e you held, and who has rea&s;on to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, is the hu&s;band of the Lady. [A Spani&s;h hu&s;band, &s;urely, Harriet; not a French one, according to our notions]. <HI>That</HI> gentleman, and <HI>that,</HI> are her brothers. We have been in pur&s;uit of them two days; for they gave out, in order, no doubt, to put us on a wrong &s;cent, that they were to go to Antwerp.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems, my dear, that Sir Hargrave, and his collegue had actually &s;ent &s;ome of their &s;ervants that way; which was the rea&s;on that they were them&s;elves attended but by one.</P>
<P>The gentleman told Sir Charles that there was a third villain in their plot. They had hopes, he &s;aid, that he would not e&s;cape the clo&s;e pur&s;uit of a manu|facturer at Abbeville, who&s;e daughter, a lovely young creature, he had &s;educed, under promi&s;es of marriage. Their government, he ob&s;erved, were great counte|nancers of the manufacturers at Abbeville; and he would have rea&s;on, if he were laid hold of, to think him&s;elf happy, if he came off with being obliged to perform his promi&s;es.</P>
<P>This third wretch mu&s;t be Mr. Bagenhall. The Lord grant, &s;ay I, that he may be laid hold of; and obliged to make a ruined girl an <HI>hone&s;t woman,</HI> as they phra&s;e it in LANCASHIRE. Don't <HI>you</HI> wi&s;h &s;o, my dear? and let me add, that had the relations of the injured Lady compleated their intended vengeance on
<PB N="252" REF="253">
tho&s;e two Libertines (A very proper puni&s;hment, I ween, for all Libertines), it might have helped them to pa&s;s the re&s;t of their lives with great tranquillity; and hone&s;t girls might, for any contrivances of theirs, have pa&s;&s;ed to and from <HI>ma&s;querades</HI> without mole&s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave and his companion intended, it &s;eems, at fir&s;t, to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance; four only, of the &s;even, &s;topping the chai&s;e: But when the other three came up, and they &s;aw who they were, and knew their own guilt, their courage failed them.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh man was &s;et over the po&s;t-boy, whom he had led about half a mile from the &s;pot they had cho&s;en as a convenient one for their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave's &s;ervant was &s;ecured by them at their fir&s;t attack; but after they had di&s;armed him and his ma&s;ters, he found an opportunity to &s;lip from them, and made the be&s;t of his way to the road, in hopes of procuring a&s;&s;i&s;tance for them.</P>
<P>While Sir Charles was bu&s;y in helping the brui&s;ed wretches on their feet, the &s;eventh man came up to the others, followed by Sir Hargrave's chai&s;e. The a&s;&s;ailants had retired to &s;ome di&s;tance, and, after a con&s;ultation together, they all advanced towards Sir Charles; who, binding his &s;ervants be on their guard, leapt on his hor&s;e, with that agility and pre&s;ence of mind, for which, Mr. Beauchamp &s;ays, he excels mo&s;t men: and leading towards them, Do you advance, gentlemen, &s;aid he, as friends, or otherwi&s;e?&mdash;Mr. Lowther took a pi&s;tol in each hand, and held him&s;elf ready to &s;upport him; and the &s;ervants di&s;po&s;ed them|&s;elves to obey their ma&s;ter's orders.</P>
<P>Our enmity, an&s;wered one of them, is only to the&s;e two <HI>inho&s;pitable</HI> villains: Murder, as we told you, was not our de&s;ign. They know where we are to be found; and that they are the vile&s;t of men, and have not been puni&s;hed equal to their demerits. Let them on their knees a&s;ks this gentleman's pardon;
<PB N="253" REF="254">
pointing to the hu&s;band of the in&s;ulted Lady. We in&s;i&s;t upon this &s;atisfaction; and upon their promi&s;e, that they never more will come within two leagues of Abbeville; and we will leave them to your protecti|on.</P>
<P>I fancy, Harriet, that the&s;e women-frightening he|roes needed not to have been urged to make this pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, turning towards them, &s;aid, If you have done wrong, gentlemen, you ought not to &s;cru|ple a&s;king pardon. If you know your&s;elves to be in|nocent, tho' I &s;hould be loth to ri&s;que the lives of my friend and &s;ervants, yet &s;hall not my countrymen make &s;o undue a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The wretches kneeled; and the &s;even men, civilly &s;aluting Sir Charles and Mr. Lowther, rode off; to the joy of the two delinquents, who kneeled again to their deliverer, and poured forth ble&s;&s;ings upon the man who&s;e life, &s;o lately, one of them &s;ought; and who&s;e pre&s;ervation he had now &s;o much rea&s;on to re|joice in, for the &s;ake of his own &s;afety.</P>
<P>My brother him&s;elf could not but be well plea&s;ed that he was not obliged to come to extremities, which might have ended fatally on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>By this time Sir Hargrave's po&s;t-chai&s;e was come up. He and his collegue were with difficulty lifted in|to it. My brother and Mr. Lowther went into theirs; and being but a &s;mall di&s;tance from Paris, they pro|ceeded thither in company; the poor wretches ble&s;&s;ing them all the way; and at Paris found their other &s;er|vants waiting for them.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and Mr. Lowther &s;aw them in bed in the lodgings that had been taken for them. They were &s;o &s;tiff with the ba&s;tinado they had met with, that they were unable to help them&s;elves. Mr. Mer|ceda had been more &s;everely (I cannot call it more cruelly) treated than the other; for he, it &s;eems, was the greate&s;t malefactor in the attempt made upon
<PB N="254" REF="255">
the Lady: And he had, be&s;ides, two or three ga&s;hes, which, but for his &s;truggles, would have been but one.</P>
<P>As you, my dear, always turn pale when the word <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> is mentioned; &s;o, I warrant, will ABBE|VILLE be a word of terror to the&s;e wretches, as long as they live.</P>
<P>Their enemies, it &s;eems, carried off their arms; perhaps, in the true &s;pirit of French chivalry, with a view to lay them, as &s;o many trophies, at the feet of the in&s;ulted Lady.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther writes, that my brother and he are lodged in the H&ocirc;tel of a man of quality, a dear friend of the late Mr Danby, and one of the three whom he has remembered in his will; and that Sir Charles is extremely bu&s;y in relation to the executor&s;hip; and, having not a moment to &s;pare, de&s;ired Mr. Lowther to engage his friend, to whom he wrote, to let us know as much; and that he was ha&s;tening every-thing for his journey onwards.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp's narrative of this affair, is, as I told you, very circum&s;tantial. I thought to have &s;hortened it more than I have done. I wi&s;h I have not made my ab&s;tract confu&s;ed, in &s;everal material places: But I have not time to clear it up. Adieu, my dear.</P>

<P>I Believe I &s;hall become as arrant a &s;cribbler as Somebody el&s;e. I begin to like writing. A great compliment to you, I a&s;&s;ure you. I &s;ee one may bring one's mind to any-thing&mdash;I thought I mu&s;t have

had recour&s;e, when you and my brother left us, and when I was married, to the publick amu&s;ements, to fill up my lei&s;ure: And as I have &s;een every-thing worth &s;eeing of tho&s;e, many times over (ma&s;querades excepted, and them I de&s;pi&s;e); time, you know, in that ca&s;e, would have pa&s;&s;ed a little heavily, after hav|ing &s;hown my&s;elf, and, by &s;eeing Who and Who were together, laid in a little &s;tore of the right &s;ort of con|ver&s;ation for the tea-table. For you know, Harriet, that among us modern fine people, the company, and not the entertainment, is the principal part of the Raree-&s;how. Pretty enough! to <HI>make</HI> the entertain|ment, and <HI>pay</HI> for it too, to the hone&s;t fellows, who have nothing to do, but to project &s;chemes to get us together.</P>
<P>I don't know what to do with this man. I little thought that I was to be con&s;idered as &s;uch a Doll, &s;uch a Toy, as he would make me. I want to drive him out of the hou&s;e without me, were it but to pur|vey for me news and &s;candal. What are your fine gentlemen &s;it for el&s;e? You know, that, with all my faults, I have a dome&s;tic and managing turn. A man &s;hould encourage that in a wife, and not be perpetu|ally teazing her for her company abroad, unle&s;s he did it with a view to keep her at home. Our Sex don't love to be pre&s;cribed to, even in the things to which they are not naturally aver&s;e: And for <HI>this</HI> very rea|&s;on, perhaps, becau&s;e it <HI>becomes</HI> us to &s;ubmit to pre|&s;cription. Human nature, Harriet, is a perver&s;e thing. I believe, if my good man wi&s;hed me to &s;tay at home, I &s;hould torture my brain, as other good wives do, for inventions to go abroad.</P>
<P>It was but ye&s;terday, that, in order to give him a hint, I pinned my apron to his coat, without con&s;i|dering who was likely to be a &s;ufferer by it; and be, getting up, in his u&s;ual nimble way, gave it a rent, and then looked behind him with <HI>&s;o</HI> much apprehen|&s;ion&mdash;Hands folded, eyes goggling, bag in motion
<PB N="256" REF="257">
from &s;houlder to &s;houlder. I was vexed too much to make the u&s;e of the trick which I had de&s;igned, and huffed him. He made excu&s;es, and looked pitifully; bringing in his Soul, to te&s;tify that he knew not how it could be&mdash;How it could be! Wretch! When you are always &s;quatting upon one's cloaths, in defiance of hoop, or di&s;tance.</P>
<P>He went out directly, and brought me in two a|prons, either of which was worth twenty of that he &s;o carele&s;ly rent. Who could be angry with him?&mdash;I was, indeed, thinking to chide him for <HI>this</HI>&mdash;As if I were not to be tru&s;ted to buy my own cloaths: And it was ju&s;t at my tongue's end, to a&s;k him, What the milaner could think of a man buying linen for a wo|man; but he looked at me with &s;o good-natured an eye, that I relented, and accepted, with a bow of gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s, his pre&s;ent; only calling him an odd crea|ture&mdash;And that he <HI>is,</HI> you know, my dear.</P>
<P>We live very whim&s;ically, in the mean: Not above four quarrels, however, and as many more chidings, in a day. What does the man &s;tay at home for then &s;o much, when I am at home? Married people, by frequent ab&s;ences, may have a chance for a little hap|pine&s;s. How many debatings, if not direct quarrels, are &s;aved by the good man's and his meek wife's &s;ee|ing each other but once or twice a week! In what can men and women, who are much together, employ them&s;elves, but in proving and defending, quarrelling and making&punc;up? E&s;pecially if they both chance to marry for Love (which, thank Heaven, is not alto|gether my ca&s;e); for then both hone&s;t &s;ouls, having promi&s;ed more happine&s;s to each other than they can po&s;&s;ibly meet with, have nothing to do but reproach each other, at lea&s;t tacitly, for their di&s;appointment.&mdash;A great deal of Free-ma&s;onry in Love, my dear, be|lieve me! The &s;ecret, like that, when found out, is hardly worth the knowing.</P>
<P>Well, but what &s;illy rattle is this, Charlotte,!
<PB N="257" REF="258">
methinks you &s;ay, and put on one of your wi&s;e&s;t looks.</P>
<P>No matter, Harriet! There may be &s;ome wi&s;dom in much folly. Every one &s;peaks not out &s;o plainly as I do. But when the novelty of an accui&s;ition or change of condition is over, be the change or the ac|qui&s;ition what it will, the principal plea&s;ure is over, and other novelties are hunted after, to keep the pool of life from &s;tagnating</P>
<P>This is a <HI>&s;erious</HI> truth, my dear, and I expect you to prai&s;e me for it. You are very &s;paring of your prai&s;e to poor me; and yet I had rather have your good word, than any woman's in the world: Or man's either, I was going to &s;ay; but I &s;hould then have forgot my <HI>brother.</HI> As for Lord G. were I to accu&s;tom him to obligingne&s;s, I &s;hould de&s;troy my own con&s;equence: for then it would be no novelty; and he would be hunting after a new folly&mdash;Very true, Harriet.</P>
<P>Well, but we have had a good &s;erious falling-out; and it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. It began on Friday night; <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> Lord and Lady L. and Emily. I was very angry with him for bringing it on before them. The man has no di&s;cretion, my dear; none at all. And what about? Why, we have not made our <HI>appearance at court,</HI> for&s;ooth.</P>
<P>A very confident thing, this &s;ame appearance, I think! A compliment made to fine cloaths and jewels, at the expence of mode&s;ty. Lord G. pleads deco|rum&mdash;Decorum again&s;t mode&s;ty, my dear!&mdash;But if by decorum is meant fa&s;hion, I have in a hundred in|&s;tances found decorum beat mode&s;ty out of the hou&s;e. And as my brother, who would have been our prin|cipal honour on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, is gone abroad; and as <HI>ours</HI> is an <HI>elderly novelty,</HI> as I may &s;ay; (our <HI>fineries</HI> were not ready, you know, before my brother went) I was &s;ervent again&s;t it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I was the only woman of condition, in England, who would be again&s;t it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
I told my Lord, that was a reflexion on my Sex: But Lord and Lady L. who had been &s;poken to, I believe, by Lady Gertrude, were both on his &s;ide [I &s;hall have this man utterly ruined for a hu&s;band among you]&mdash;When there were three to one, it would have looked cowardly to yield, you know. I was brave. But it being propo&s;ed for Sunday, and that being at a little di&s;tance, it was not doubted but I would com|ply. So the night pa&s;t off, with prayings, hopings, and a little <HI>mutteration</HI> [Allow me that word, or find me a better.] The entreaty was renewed in the morn|ing; but, no!&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I was a&s;hamed of him,' he &s;aid. I a&s;ked him, If he really thought &s;o?&mdash;He <HI>&s;hould</HI> think &s;o, if I refu&s;ed him.'</Q> Heaven forbid, my Lord, that I, who contend for the liberty of acting, &s;hould hinder you from the liberty of thinking! Only one piece of advice, hone&s;t friend, &s;aid I: Don't ima|gine the wor&s;t again&s;t your&s;elf: And another, If you have a mind to carry a point with me, don't bring on the cau&s;e before any-body el&s;e: For that would be to doubt either my duty, or your own rea&s;onable|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;ure as you are alive, Harriet, the man made an exception again&s;t being called <HI>hone&s;t friend;</HI> as if, as I told him, either of the words were incompatible with <HI>quality.</HI> So, once, he was as froppi&s;h as a child, on my calling him <HI>the man;</HI> a higher di&s;tinction, I think, than if I had called him a king, or a prince. THE MAN!&mdash;Strange creature! To except to a di&s;tinction that implies, that he is the Man of Men!&mdash;You &s;ee what a captious mortal I have been forced to call My Lord. But <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> do not always go together; tho' they do <HI>too</HI> often, for the happine&s;s of many a meek &s;oul of our Sex.</P>
<P>Well, this debate &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended, by my telling him, that if I were pre&s;ented at court, I would not have either the Earl or Lady Gertrude go with us, the very people who <HI>were</HI> mo&s;t de&s;irous to be there&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="260">
But I <HI>might</HI> not think of that, at the time, you know&mdash;I would not be thought <HI>very</HI> perver&s;e; only a little whim&s;ical, or &s;o. And I wanted not an excellent rea|&s;on for excluding them&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Are their <HI>con&s;ents</HI> to our pa&s;t affair <HI>doubted,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, that you think it nece&s;&s;ary for them to appear to ju&s;tify us?'</Q></P>
<P>He could &s;ay nothing to this, you know. And I &s;hould never forgive the hu&s;band, as I told him, on an|other occa&s;ion, who would pretend to argue, when he had nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Then (for the baby will be always craving &s;ome|thing) he wanted me to go abroad with him&mdash;I forget whither&mdash;But to &s;ome place that he &s;uppo&s;ed (poor man!) I &s;hould <HI>like</HI> to vi&s;it. I told him, I dared to &s;ay, he wi&s;hed to be thought a <HI>modern</HI> hu&s;band, and a <HI>fa&s;hi|onable</HI> man; and he would get a bad name, if he could never &s;tir out without his wife. <HI>Neither</HI> could he an|&s;wer <HI>that,</HI> you I now.</P>
<P>Well, we went on, mutter, mutter, grumble, grumble, the thunder rolling at a di&s;tance; a little im|patience now-and-then, however, portending, that it would come nearer. But, as yet, it was only, Pray, my dear, oblige me; and, Pray, my Lord, excu&s;e me; till this morning, when he had the a&s;&s;urance to be pret|ty peremptory: hinting, that the Lord in waiting had been &s;poke to. A fine time of it would a wife have, if &s;he were not at liberty to dre&s;s her&s;elf as &s;he plea&s;es. Were I to choo&s;e again, I do a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, it &s;hould not be a man, who by his ta&s;te for Moths and Butterflies, Shells, China, and &s;uch like trifles, would give me warning, that he would pre&s;ume to dre&s;s his baby, and when he had done, would perhaps admire his own fancy more than her per&s;on. I believe, my Harriet, I &s;hall make you afraid of Matrimony: But I will pur&s;ue my &s;ubject, for all that.&mdash;</P>
<P>When the In&s;olent &s;aw that I did not dre&s;s, as he would have had me; he drew out his face, glouting, to half the length of my arm; but was &s;ilent. Soon
<PB N="260" REF="261">
after Lady L. &s;ending to know whether her Lord and &s;he were to attend as to the Drawing-room, and I re|turning for an&s;wer, that I &s;hould be glad of their com|pany at dinner; he was in violent wrath. True, as you are alive! and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in a great hurry, left the hou&s;e, without &s;aying, By your leave, with your leave, or Whether he would return to dinner, or not. Very pretty doings, Harriet!</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. came to dinner, however. I thought they were very kind, and, till they opened their lips, was going to thank them: For then, it was all <HI>elder</HI> Si&s;ter, and in&s;olent Brother-in-law, I do a&s;|&s;ure you. Upon my word, Harriet, they took upon them.</P>
<P>Lady L. told me, I might be the happie&s;t creature in the world, if&mdash;and there was &s;o good as to &s;top.</P>
<P><HI>One</HI> of the happie&s;t only, Lady L.&punc; Who can be happier than you?</P>
<P>But I, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hould neither <HI>be</HI> &s;o, nor <HI>de&s;erve</HI> to be &s;o, <HI>if</HI>&mdash;Good of her again, to &s;top at <HI>if.</HI></P>
<P>We can't be all of one mind, replied I. I &s;hall be wi&s;er, in time.</P>
<P>Where was poor Lord G. gone?</P>
<P><HI>Poor</HI> Lord G. is gone to &s;eek his fortune, I be|lieve.</P>
<P>What did I mean?</P>
<P>I told them the airs he had given him&s;elf; and that he was gone without leave, or notice of return.</P>
<P>He had &s;erved me right, <HI>ab</HI>-&s;olutely right, Lord L. &s;aid.</P>
<P>I believed &s;o my&s;elf. Lord G. was a very good &s;ort of man, and ought not to bear with me &s;o much as he had done: But it would be kind in them, not to tell him what I had owned.</P>
<P>The Earl lifted up one hand; the Counte&s;s both. They had not come to dine with me, they &s;aid, after the an&s;wer I had returned, but as they were afraid &s;omething was wrong between us.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">
Mediators are not to be of one &s;ide only, I &s;aid: And as they had been &s;o kindly free in blaming me, I hoped they would be as free with him, when they &s;aw him.</P>
<P>And then it was, For <HI>God</HI>'s &s;ake, Charlotte; and, Let me <HI>entreat</HI> you, Lady G. And let <HI>me,</HI> too, <HI>be&s;eech</HI> you, madam, &s;aid Emily, with tears &s;tealing down her cheeks.</P>
<P>You are both very good: You are a &s;weet girl, Emily. I have a too-playful heart. It will give me &s;ome pain, and &s;ome plea&s;ure; but if I had not more plea&s;ure than pain from my play, I &s;hould not be &s;o &s;illy.</P>
<P>My Lord not coming in, and the dinner being ready, I ordered it to be &s;erved.&mdash;Won't you wait a little longer for Lord G?&mdash;No. I hope he is &s;afe, and well. He is his own ma&s;ter, as well as mine (I &s;ighed, I believe!); and, no doubt, has a paramount plea&s;ure in pur&s;uing his own choice.</P>
<P>They raved. I begged that they would let us eat our dinner with <HI>comfort.</HI> My Lord, I hoped, would come in with a keen appetite, and Nelthorpe &s;hould get a &s;upper for him that he liked.</P>
<P>When we had dined, and retired into the adjoining drawing-room, I had another &s;chooling-bout: Emily was even &s;aucy. But I took it all: Yet, in my heart, was vexed at Lord G.'s perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in came the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man. He does not read this, and &s;o cannot take exceptions, and I hope <HI>you</HI> will not, at the word <HI>hone&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>So lordly! &s;o &s;tiff! &s;o &s;olemn!&mdash;Upon my word!&mdash;Had it not been Sunday, I would have gone to my harp&s;ichord directly. He bowed to Lord and Lady L. and to Emily, very obligingly; to me he nodded.&mdash;I nodded again; but, like a good-natured fool, &s;miled. He &s;talked to the chimney; turned his back towards it, buttoned up his mouth, held up his glowing face, as if he were di&s;po&s;ed to crow; yet had not won the

battle.&mdash;One hand in his bo&s;om; the other under the &s;kirt of his wai&s;tcoat, and his po&s;ture firmer than his mind.&mdash;Yet was my heart &s;o devoid of malice, that I thought his attitude very genteel; and, had we not been man and wife, agreeable.</P>
<P>We hoped to have found your Lord&s;hip at home, &s;aid Lord L. or we &s;hould not have dined here.</P>
<P>If Lord G. is as polite a <HI>hu&s;band</HI> as a <HI>man,</HI> &s;aid I, he will not thank your Lord&s;hip for this compliment to his wife.</P>
<P>Lord G. &s;welled, and reared him&s;elf up. His com|plexion, which was before in a glow, was heightened.</P>
<P><HI>Poor man!</HI> thought I.&mdash;But why &s;hould my ten|der heart pity ob&s;tinate people?&mdash;Yet I could not help being dutiful.&mdash;Have you dined, my Lord? &s;aid I, with a &s;weet &s;mile, and very courteous.</P>
<P>He &s;talked to the window, and never a word an|&s;wered he.</P>
<P>Pray Lady L. be &s;o good as to a&s;k my Lord G. If he has dined? Was not this very conde&s;cending, on &s;uch a behaviour?</P>
<P>Lady L. <HI>a&s;ked</HI> him, and as gently-voiced as if &s;he were a&s;king the &s;ame que&s;tion of her own Lord. Lady L. is a kind-hearted &s;oul, Harriet: She is <HI>my</HI> Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>I have <HI>not,</HI> madam, to Lady L. turning rudely from me, and, not very civilly from her. Ah! thought I, the&s;e men! The more they are courted!&mdash;Wretches! to find their con&s;equence in a woman's meekne&s;s.&mdash;Yet, I could not forbear &s;hewing mine.&mdash;Nature, Harriet! Who can re&s;i&s;t con&s;titution?</P>
<P>What &s;tiff airs are the&s;e? approaching him.&mdash;I do a&s;&s;ure you, my Lord, I &s;hall not take this behaviour well; and put my hand on his arm.</P>
<P>I was &s;erved right. Would you believe it? The man &s;hook off my conde&s;cending hand, by rai&s;ing his elbow &s;cornfully. He really did!</P>
<P>Nay, then!&mdash;I left him, and retired to my former

&s;eat. I was vexed that it was Sunday: I wanted a little harmony.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L, both blamed me, by their looks; and my Lady took my hand, and was leading me to|wards him. I &s;hewed a little reluctance: And, would you have thought it? out of the drawing-room whipt my nimble Lord, as if on purpo&s;e to avoid being mo|ved by my conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I took my place again.</P>

Would he an&s;wer me a que&s;tion, which I kind|ly put to him, fearing he had not dined, and might be &s;ick for want of eating?

<P><HI>Oons,</HI> madam! &s;aid he, and he kemboed his arms, and &s;trutted up to me. Now for a cuff, thought I. I was half afraid of it: But out of the room again capered he.</P>

<P>Lord and Lady L. both turned from me with indig|nation.

But no wonder if <HI>one,</HI> that they <HI>both</HI> did. They are a &s;illy pair; and I believe have agreed to keep each other in countenance in all they do.</P>

<P>MY Lord and I have had another little&mdash;<HI>Tiff,</HI> &s;hall I call it? It came not up to a quarrel. Married people would have enough to do, if they were to trouble their friends every time they mi&s;|under&s;tood one another. And now a word or two of other people: Not always &s;cribbling of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t heard that our cou&s;in Everard has added another fool of our Sex to the number of the weak ones who di&s;grace it: A &s;orry fellow! He has been &s;een with her, by one whom he would not know, at Cuper's Gardens; dre&s;&s;ed like a Sea&punc;officer, and &s;kulking, like a thief, into the private&s;t walks of the place. When he is tired of the poor wretch, he will want to accommodate with us by promi&s;es of pe|nitence and reformation, as once or twice before. Rakes are not only odious, but they are de&s;picable fellows. You will the more clearly &s;ee this, when I a&s;&s;ure you, from tho&s;e who know, that this &s;illy crea|ture our cou&s;in is looked upon, among his brother Libertines, and Smarts, as a man of <HI>fir&s;t</HI> con&s;idera|tion!</P>
<P>He has al&s;o been &s;een, in a gayer habit, at a cer|tain Gaming-table, near Covent-Garden; where he did not content him&s;elf with being an idle &s;pectator. Colonel Winwood, our informant, &s;hook his head, but made no other an&s;wer, to &s;ome of our enquiries. May he &s;uffer! &s;ay I.&mdash;A &s;orry fellow!&mdash;</P>
<P>Preparations are going on, all <HI>&s;o-fa&s;t</HI> at Wind&s;or.
<PB N="267" REF="268">
We are all invited. God grant that Mi&s;s Mansfield may be as happy a Lady W. as we all conclude &s;he will be! But I never was fond of matches between &s;ober young women, and battered old rakes. Much good may do the adventurers, drawn in by gewgaw and title!&mdash;Poor things!&mdash;But convenience, when that's the motive, whatever fooli&s;h girls think, will hold out its comforts, while a gratified Love quickly evaporates.</P>
<P>Beauchamp, who is acquainted with the Mans|fields, is intru&s;ted by my brother, in his ab&s;ence, with the management of the Law-affairs. He hopes, he &s;ays, to give a good account of them. The ba&s;e &s;teward of the uncle Calvert, who lived as a hu&s;band with the woman who had been forced upon his &s;uper|annuated ma&s;ter in a doting fit, has been brought, by the death of one of the children born in Mr. Cal|vert's life-time, and by the precarious health of the po&s;thumous one, to make overtures of accommo|dation. A new hearing of the cau&s;e between them and the Keelings, is granted; and great things are ex|pected from it, in their favour, from &s;ome new lights thrown in upon that &s;uit. The Keelings are frighted out of their wits, it &s;eems; and are applying to Sir John Lambton, a di&s;intere&s;ted neighbour, to offer him&s;elf as a mediator between them. The Mans|fields will &s;o &s;oon be related to us, that I make no apology for intere&s;ting you in their affairs.</P>
<P>Be &s;ure you chide me for my whim&s;ical behaviour to Lord G. I know you will. But don't blame my <HI>heart:</HI> My <HI>head</HI> only is wrong.</P>
<P>A little more from fre&s;h informations of this &s;orry varlet Everard. I wi&s;hed him to &s;uffer; but I wi&s;hed him not to be &s;o very great a &s;ufferer as it &s;eems he is Sharpers have bit his head off, quite clo&s;e to his &s;houlders: They have not left it him to carry under his arm, as the hone&s;t patron of France did his
<PB N="268" REF="269">
They lend it him, however, now-and-then, to repent with, and cur&s;e him&s;elf. The creature he attended to Cuper's Gardens, in&s;tead of a country Innocent, as he expected her to be, comes out to be a ca&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, experienced in all the arts of &s;uch, and act|ing under the &s;ecret influences of a man of quality; who, wanting to get rid of her, &s;upports her in a pro&s;ecution commenced again&s;t him (poor devil) for performance of covenants. He was extremely mor|tified, on finding my brother gone abroad: He intends to apply to him for his pity and help. Sorry fellow! He boa&s;ted to us, on our expectation of our brother's arrival from abroad, that he would enter his cou&s;in Charles into the ways of the town. Now he wants to avail him&s;elf again&s;t the practices of the &s;ons of that town by his cou&s;in's character and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>A combination of &s;harpers, it &s;eems, had long &s;et him as a man of fortune: But, on his taking refuge with my brother, gave over, for a time, their de&s;igns upon him, till he threw him&s;elf again in their way.</P>
<P>The worthle&s;s fellow had been often liberal of his promi&s;es of marriage to young creatures of more in|nocence than <HI>this;</HI> and thinks it very hard that he &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted for a crime which he had &s;o fre|quently committed, with impunity. Can you pity him? I cannot, I a&s;&s;ure you. The man who can betray and ruin an innocent woman, who loves him, ought to be abhorred by <HI>men.</HI> Would he &s;cruple to betray and ruin <HI>them,</HI> if he were not afraid of the Law?&mdash;Yet there are women, who can forgive &s;uch wretches, and herd with them.&mdash;</P>
<P>My aunt Eleanor is arrived: A good, plump, bonny|faced old virgin. She has cho&s;en her apartment. At pre&s;ent we are mo&s;t prodigiou&s;ly civil to each other: But already I &s;u&s;pect &s;he likes Lord G. better than I would have her. She will perhaps, if a party &s;hould be formed again&s;t your poor Charlotte, make one of it.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="270">
Will you think it time thrown away, to read a further account of what is come to hand about the wretches who lately, in the double &s;en&s;e of the word, were <HI>overtaken</HI> between St. Denis and Paris?</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, it &s;eems, &s;till keeps his chamber: He is thought not to be out of danger from &s;ome inward hurt, which often makes him bring up blood in quantities. He is mi&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ed by lowne&s;s of &s;pirits; and when he is a little better in that re&s;pect, his impatience makes his friends appre|hen&s;ive for his head. But has <HI>he</HI> intellects &s;trong enough to give apprehen&s;ions of that nature? Fool and mad|man we often join as terms of reproach; but I be|lieve, fools &s;eldom run really mad.</P>
<P>Merceda is in a &s;till more dangerous way. Be&s;ides his brui&s;es, and a fractured &s;kull, he has, it &s;eems, a wound in his thigh, which in the delirium he was thrown into by the fracture, was not duly attended to; and which, but for his <HI>valiant</HI> &s;truggles again&s;t the knife which gave the wound, was de&s;igned for a &s;till greater mi&s;chief. His recovery is de&s;paired of; and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of pe|nitence and reformation, if his life may be &s;pared.</P>
<P>Bagenhall <HI>was</HI> the per&s;on who had &s;educed, by pro|mi&s;es of marriage, and fled for it, the manufacturer's daughter of Abbeville. He was overtaken by his pur|&s;uers at Douay. The incen&s;ed father, and friends of the young woman, would not be otherwi&s;e pacified than by his performing his promi&s;e; which, with infi|nite reluctance, he complied with, principally thro' the threats of the brother, who is noted for his fierce|ne&s;s and re&s;olution; and who once made the &s;orry creature feel an Argument which greatly terrified him. Bagenhall is at pre&s;ent at Abbeville, living as well as he can with his new wife, cur&s;ing his fate, no doubt, in &s;ecret. He is obliged to appear fond of her before her brother and father; the latter being al&s;o a four man, a Ga&s;con, always boa&s;ting of his family, and
<PB N="270" REF="271">
valuing him&s;elf upon a <HI>de,</HI> affixed by <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to his name, and jealous of indignity offered to it. The fierce brother is re&s;olved to accompany his &s;i&s;ter to England, when Bagenhall goes thither, in order, as he declares, to &s;ecure to her good u&s;age, and &s;ee her owned and vi&s;ited by all Bagenhall's friends and rela|tions. And thus much of the&s;e fine gentlemen.</P>
<P>How different a man is Beauchamp! But it is in|juring him, to think of tho&s;e wretches and him at the &s;ame time. He certainly has an eye to Emily, but behaves with great prudence towards her: Yet every|body but <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;ees his regard for her: Nobody but her guardian runs in her head; and the more, as the really thinks it is a glory to love him, becau&s;e of his good|ne&s;s. Every-body, &s;he &s;ays, has the <HI>&s;ame</HI> admiration of him, that &s;he has.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves de&s;ires me to acquaint you, that Mi&s;s Clements having by the death of her mother and aunt, come into a prety fortune, is addre&s;&s;ed to by a York&s;hire gentleman of ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and is preparing to go down thither to re&s;ide; but that &s;he intends to write to you before &s;he goes, and to beg you to favour her with now-and-then a Letter.</P>
<P>I think Mi&s;s Clements is a good &s;ort of young wo|man: But I imagined &s;he would have been one of tho&s;e Nuns at large, who need not make vows of liv|ing and dying Aunt Eleanors, or Lady Gertrudes; all three of them good hone&s;t &s;ouls! cha&s;te, pious, and plain. It is a charming &s;ituation, when a woman is arrived at &s;uch a height of perfection, as to be above giving or receiving temptation. Sweet innocents! They have my reverence, if not my love. How would they be affronted, if I were to &s;ay <HI>pity!</HI>&mdash;I think only of my two good Aunts, at the pre&s;ent writing. Mi&s;s Clements, you know, is a <HI>youngi&s;h</HI> woman; and I re&s;pect her much. One would not je&s;t upon the un&s;ightline&s;s of per&s;on, or plainne&s;s of feature: but think you &s;he will not be one of tho&s;e,

<P>I Will now, my dear Brother, give you a circum&s;tan|tial account of our &s;hort, but flying journey. The 20th of April, O. S. early in the morning, we left Paris, and reached Lyons the 24th at night.</P>
<P>Re&s;ting but a few hours, we &s;et out for Pont Beau|voi&s;in, where we arrived the following evening: There we bid adieu to France, and found our&s;elves in Savoy, equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains. Indeed it was a total change of the &s;cene. We had left behind us a blooming &s;pring, which enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road we pa&s;&s;ed, and the meadows already &s;miled with flowers. The chearful inhabitants were bu&s;y in adju&s;ting their limits, lopping their trees, pruning their vines, tilling their fields: But when we entered Savoy, nature wore a very different face;
<PB N="272" REF="273">
and I mu&s;t own, that my &s;pirits were great &s;ufferers by the change. Here we began to view on the nearer mountains, covered with ice and &s;now, notwith&s;tand|ing the advanced &s;ea&s;on, the rigid winter, in frozen maje&s;ty, &s;till pre&s;erving its domains: And arriving at St. Jean de Maurienne the night of the 26th, the &s;now &s;eemed as if it would di&s;pute with us our pa&s;|&s;age; and horrible was the force of the boi&s;trous winds, which &s;at full in our faces.</P>
<P>Overpowered by the fatigues I had undergone in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he expedition we had made, the un&s;ea&s;onable cold|ne&s;s of the weather, and the &s;ight of one of the wor&s;t countries under heaven, &s;till cloathed in &s;now, and deformed by continual hurricanes; I was here taken ill. Sir Charles was greatly concerned for my indi&s;|po&s;ition, which was increa&s;ed by a great lowne&s;s of &s;pirits. He attended upon me in per&s;on; and never had man a more kind and indulgent friend. Here we &s;tayed two days; and then, my illne&s;s being prin|cipally owing to fatigue, I found my&s;elf enabled to proceed. At two of the clock in the morning of the 28th, we pro&s;ecuted our journey, in palpable dark|ne&s;s, and di&s;mal weather, tho' the winds were &s;ome|what laid, and reaching the foot of Mount Cenis by break of day, arrived at Lanebourg, a poor little vil|lage, &s;o environed by high mountains, that, for three months in the twelve, it is hardly vi&s;ited by the chear|ing rays of the &s;un. Every object which here pre|&s;ents it&s;elf is exce&s;&s;ively mi&s;erable. The people are generally of an olive complexion, with wens under their chins; &s;ome &s;o mon&s;trous, e&s;pecially women, as quite disfigure them.</P>
<P>Here it is u&s;ual to un&s;crew and take in pieces the chai&s;es, in order to carry them on mules over the mountain; and to put them together on the other &s;ide; For the Savoy &s;ide of the mountain is much more difficult to pa&s;s than the other. But Sir Charles cho&s;e not to lo&s;e time; and therefore left the chai&s;e
<PB N="273" REF="274">
to the care of the inn-keeper; proceeding, with all expedition, to gain the top of the hill.</P>
<P>The way we were carried, was as follows: A kind of hor&s;e, as it is called with you, with two poles, like tho&s;e of chairmen, was the vehicle; on which is &s;ecured a &s;ort of elbow chair, in which the traveller &s;its. A man before, another behind, carry this open machine with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s, that they are continually running and &s;kipping, like wild goats, from rock to rock, the four miles of that a&s;cent. If a traveller were not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that the&s;e moun|taineers are the &s;ure&s;t-footed carriers in the univer&s;e, he would be in continual apprehen&s;ions of being over|turned. I, who never undertook this journey before, mu&s;t own, that I could not be &s;o fearle&s;s, on this oc|ca&s;ion, as Sir Charles was, tho' he had very exactly de&s;cribed to me how every-thing would be. Then, tho' the &s;ky was clear when we pa&s;&s;ed this mountain, yet the cold wind blew quantities of frozen &s;now in our faces; in&s;omuch that it &s;eemed to me ju&s;t as if people were employed, all the time we were pa&s;&s;ing to wound us with the &s;harpe&s;t needles. They indeed call the wind that brings this &s;harp-pointed &s;now, <HI>The Tormenta.</HI></P>
<P>An adventure, which any-where el&s;e might have ap|peared ridiculous, I was afraid would have proved fa|tal to one of our chairmen, as I will call them. I had &s;lapt down my hat to &s;creen my eyes from the fury of that deluge of &s;harp-pointed frozen &s;now; and it was blown off my head, by a &s;udden gu&s;t, down the precipices: I gave it for lo&s;t, and was about to bind a handkerchief over the woollen cap, which tho&s;e people provide to tie under the chin; when one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant carriers (for they are always &s;ix in number to every chair, in order to relieve one an|other) undertook to recover it. I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to be done; the pa&s;&s;age being, as I imagined, only practicable for birds: However, I promi&s;ed him a
<PB N="274" REF="275">
crown reward, if he did. Never could the leaps of the mo&s;t dextrous of rope-dancers be compared to tho&s;e of this daring fellow: I &s;aw him &s;ometimes jumping from rock to rock, &s;ometimes rolling down a declivity of &s;now like a ninepin, &s;ometimes running, &s;ometimes hopping, &s;kipping; in &s;hort, he de&s;cended like light|ning to the verge of a torrent, where he &s;ound the hat. He came up almo&s;t as quick, and appeared as little fatigued, as if he had never left us.</P>
<P>We arrived as the top in two hours, from Lane|bourg; and the &s;un was pretty high above the ho|rizon. Out of a hut, half-buried in &s;now, came &s;ome mountaineers, with two poor &s;ledges, drawn by mules, to carry as through the <HI>Plain of Mount Cenis,</HI> as it is called, which is about four Italian miles in length, to the de&s;cent of the Italian &s;ide of the mountain. The&s;e &s;ledges are not much different from the chairs, or &s;edans, or hor&s;e, we then quitted; only the two under-poles are flat, and not &s;o long as the others, and turning up a little at the end, to hinder them from &s;ticking fa&s;t in the &s;now. To the fore-ends of the poles are fixed two round &s;ticks, about two feet and a half long, which &s;erve for a &s;upport and help to the man who guides the mule, who running on the &s;now between the mule and the &s;ledge, holds the &s;ticks with eaeh hand.</P>
<P>It was diverting to &s;ee the two &s;ledgemen &s;triving to out-run each other. Encouraged by Sir Charles's genero&s;ity, we arrived at the other end of the plain in le&s;s than two hours: The man who walked, or rather run, between the &s;ledge and the mule, made a conti|nual noi&s;e; halloowing and beating the &s;tubborn bea&s;t with his fi&s;ts, which otherwi&s;e would be very &s;low in its motion.</P>
<P>At the &eacute;nd of this plain we found &s;uch another hut as that on the Lanebourg &s;ide: Here they took off the &s;moaking mules from the &s;ledges, to give them re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">
And now began the mo&s;t extraordinary way of tra|velling that can be imagined. The de&s;cent of the moun|tain from the top of this &s;ide, to a &s;mall village called Novale&s;a, is four Italian miles. When the &s;how has filled up all the inequalities of the mountain, it looks, in many parts, as &s;mooth and equal as a &s;ugar-loaf. It is on the brink of this rapid de&s;cent that they put the &s;ledge. The man who is to guide it, &s;its between the &s;eet of the traveller, who is &s;eated in the elbow chair, with his legs at the out&s;ide of the &s;ticks fixed at the fore-ends of the flat poles, and holds the two &s;ticks with his hands; and when the &s;ledge has gained the de|clivity, its own weight carries it down with &s;urpri&s;ing celerity. But as the immen&s;e irregular rocks under the &s;now make now-and-then &s;ome edges in the decli|vity, which, if not avoided, would overturn the &s;ledge; the guide, who fore&s;ees the danger, by putting his foot &s;trongly and dextrou&s;ly in the &s;now next to the pre|cipice, turns the machine, by help of the above-men|tioned &s;ticks, the contrary way, and, by way of zig|zag, goes to the bottom. Such was the velocity of this motion, that we di&s;patched the&s;e four miles in le&s;s than five minutes; and, when we arrived at Novale|&s;a, hearing that the &s;now was very deep mo&s;t of the way to Su&s;a, and being plea&s;ed with our way of tra|velling, we had &s;ome mules put again to the &s;ledges, and ran all the way to the very gates of that city, which is &s;even miles di&s;tant from Mount Cenis.</P>
<P>In our way we had a cur&s;ory view of the impreg|nable fortre&s;s of Brunetta, the greate&s;t part of which is cut out of the &s;olid rock, and commands that im|portant pa&s;s.</P>
<P>We re&s;ted all night at Su&s;a; and, having bought a very commodious po&s;t-chai&s;e, we proceeded to Turin, where we dined; and from thence, the evening of May 2. O. S. got to Parma by way of Alexandria and Placentia, having purpo&s;ely avoided the high road
<PB N="276" REF="277">
through Milan, as it would have co&s;t us a few hours more time.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ob&s;erved to me, when we were on the plain or flat top of Mount Cenis, that, had not the winter been particularly long and &s;evere, we &s;hould have had, in&s;tead of this terrible appearance of &s;now there, flowers &s;tarting up, as it were, under our feet, of various kinds, which are hardly to be met with any|where el&s;e. One of the greate&s;t dangers, he told me, in pa&s;&s;ing this mount in winter, ari&s;es from a ball of &s;now, which is blown down from the top by the wind, or falls down by &s;ome other accident; which, gather|ing all the way in its de&s;cent, becomes in&s;tantly of &s;uch a prodigious bigne&s;s, that there is hardly any avoiding being carried away with it, man and bea&s;t, and &s;moth|ered in it. One of the&s;e balls we &s;aw rolling down; but as it took another cour&s;e than ours, we had no ap|prehen&s;ions of danger from it.</P>
<P>At Parma we found expecting us, the Bi&s;hop of Nocera, and a very Reverend Father, Mare&s;cotti by name; who expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t joy at the arrival of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and received me, at his recom|mendation, with a politene&s;s which &s;eems natural to them. I will not repeat what I have written before of this excellent young gentleman: Intrepidity, bra|very, di&s;cretion, as well as genero&s;ity, are con&s;picuous parts of his character. He is &s;tudious to avoid dan|ger; but is unappalled in it. For humanity, benevo|lence, providence for others, to his very &s;ervants, I never met with his equal.</P>
<P>My reception from the noble family to which he has introduced me; the patient's ca&s;e (a very unhappy one!); and a de&s;cription of this noble city, and the fine country about it; &s;hall be the &s;ubject of my next.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE>Wedne&s;day, May <HI>10-21.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Told you, my dear and reverend friend, that I &s;hould hardly write to you till I arrived in this ci|ty.</P>
<P>The affair of my executor&s;hip obliged me to &s;tay a day longer at Paris than I intended: but I have put every thing relating to that tru&s;t in &s;uch a way, as to an&s;wer all my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther wrote to Mr. Arnold, a friend of his in London, the particulars of the extraordinary affair we were engaged in between St. Denis and Paris; with de&s;ire that he would inform my friends of our ar|rival at that capital.</P>
<P>We were obliged to &s;top two days at St. Jean de Maurienne: The expedition we travelled with was too much for Mr. Lowther; and I expected, and was not di&s;appointed, from the unu&s;ual backwardne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, to find the pa&s;&s;age over Mount Cenis le&s;s agreeable than it u&s;ually is in the beginning of May.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of Nocera had offered to meet me any where on his &s;ide of the mountains. I wrote to him from Lyons, that I hoped to &s;ee him at Parma, on or about the very day that I was &s;o fortunate as to reach the palace of the Count of Belvedere in that city; where I found, that he and Father Mare&s;cotti had ar|rived the evening before. They, as well as the Count, expre&s;&s;ed great joy to &s;ee me; and when I pre&s;ented Mr. Lowther to them, with the prai&s;es due to his &s;kill, and let them know the con&s;ultations I had had with eminent phy&s;icians of my own country, on Lady Clementina's ca&s;e, they invoked ble&s;&s;ings upon us both, and would not be interrupted in them by my eager que&s;tions after the health and &s;tate of mind
<PB N="278" REF="279">
of the two deare&s;t per&s;ons of their family&mdash;Unhap|py! <HI>very</HI> unhappy! &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. Let us give you &s;ome refre&s;hment, before we come to particulars.</P>
<P>To my repeated enquiries, Jeronymo, poor Jero|nymo! &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, is living, and that is all we can &s;ay.&mdash;The &s;ight of you will be a cordial to his heart. Clementina is on her journey to Bologna from Naples. You de&s;ired to find her with us, and not at Naples. She is weak; is obliged to travel &s;lowly. She will re&s;t at Urbino two or three days. Dear creature! What has &s;he not &s;uffered from the cruelty of her cou&s;in Laurana, as well as from her malady! The General has been, and is, indulgent to her. He is married to a Lady of great merit, quality, and for|tune. He has, at length, con&s;ented that we &s;hall try this la&s;t experiment, as the hearts of my mother and now lately of my father, as well as mine, are in it. His Lady would not be denied accompanying my &s;i&s;ter; and as my brother could not bear being ab|&s;ent from her, he travels with them. I wi&s;h he had &s;tay'd at Naples. I hope, however, he will be as ready, as you will find us all, to acknowlege the fa|vour of this vi&s;it, and the fatigue and trouble you have given your&s;elf on our account.</P>
<P>As to my &s;i&s;ter's bodily health, proceeded he, it is greatly impaired. We are almo&s;t hopele&s;s, with re|gard to the &s;tate of her mind. She &s;peaks not; &s;he an&s;wers not any que&s;tions. Camilla is with her. She &s;eems regardle&s;s of any-body el&s;e. She has been told, that the General is married. His Lady makes great court to her; but &s;he heeds her not. We are in hopes, that my mother, on her return to Bologna, will engage her attention. She never yet was &s;o bad as to forget her duty, either to God, or her Parents. Sometimes Camilla thinks &s;he pays &s;ome little at|tention to your name; but then &s;he in&s;tantly &s;tarts, as in terror; looks round her with fear; puts her finger to her lips, as if &s;he dreaded her cruel cou&s;in Lau|rana
<PB N="279" REF="280">
&s;hould be told of her having heard it mention|ed.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop and Father both regretted that &s;he had been denied the reque&s;ted interview. They were now, they &s;aid, convinced, that if that had been granted, and &s;he had been left to Mrs. Beaumont's friendly care, a happy i&s;&s;ue might have been hoped for: But <HI>now,</HI> &s;aid the Bi&s;hop&mdash;Then &s;ighed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I di&s;patched Saunders, early the next morning, to Bologna, to procure convenient lodgings for me, and Mr. Lowther.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we &s;et out for that city. The Count of Belvedere found an opportunity to let me know his unabated pa&s;&s;ion for Clementina, and that he had lately made overtures to marry her, notwith|&s;tanding her malady; having been advi&s;ed, he &s;aid, by proper per&s;ons, that as it was not an hereditary, but an accidental di&s;order, it might be, in time, cure|able. He accompanied us about half way in our journey; and, at parting, Remember, Chevalier, whi&s;pered he, that Clementina is the Soul of my hope: I cannot forego that hope. No other woman will I ever call mine.</P>
<P>I heard him in &s;ilence: I admired him for his at|tachment: I pitied him. He &s;aid, he would tell me more of his mind at Bologna.</P>
<P>We reached Bologna on the 15th, N. S. Saunders had engaged for me the lodgings I had before.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation on the road turned chiefly on the ca&s;e of Signor Jeronymo. The Bi&s;hop and Father were highly plea&s;ed with the &s;kill, founded on practice, which evidently appeared in all that Mr. Lowther &s;aid on the &s;ubject: And the Bi&s;hop once intimated, that, be the event what it would, his journey to Italy &s;hould be made the mo&s;t beneficial affair to him he had ever engaged in. Mr. Lowther replied, that as he was neither a nece&s;&s;itous nor a mean-&s;pirited man, and
<PB N="280" REF="281">
had rea&s;on to be entirely &s;atisfied with the terms I had already &s;ecured to him; he &s;hould take it unkindly, if any other reward were offered him.</P>
<P>Think, my dear Dr. Bartlett, what emotions I mu&s;t have on entering, once more, the gates of the Porretta palace, tho' Clementina was not there.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened up to my Jeronymo, who had been ap|prized of my arrival. The moment he &s;aw me, Do I once more, &s;aid he, behold my friend, my Gran|di&s;on? Let me embrace the deare&s;t of men. Now, now, have I lived long enough. He bowed his head upon his pillow, and meditated me; his countenance &s;hining with plea&s;ure, in defiance of pain.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop entered, he could not be pre&s;ent at our fir&s;t interview.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid Jeronymo, make it your care that my dear friend be treated, by every &s;oul of our family, with the gratitude and re&s;pect which are due to his goodne&s;s. Methinks I am ea&s;ier and happier, this moment, than I have been for the tedious &s;pace of time &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw him. He named that &s;pace of time to the day, and to the very hour of the day.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s &s;ignifying their plea|&s;ure to &s;ee me, the Bi&s;hop led me to them. My re|ception from the Marquis was kind; from his Lady it was as that of a mother to a long-ab&s;ent &s;on. I had ever been, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, a fourth &s;on in her eye; and now, that &s;he had been informed that I had brought over with me a &s;urgeon of expe|rience, and the advice in writing of eminent phy&s;ici|ans of my country, the obligations I had laid on their whole family, whatever were the &s;ucce&s;s, were un|returnable.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked leave to introduce Mr. Lowther to them. They received him with great politene&s;s, and recom|mended their Jeronymo to his be&s;t &s;kill. Mr. Low|ther's hone&s;t heart was engaged, by a reception &s;o kind. He never, he told me afterwards, beheld &s;o
<PB N="281" REF="282">
much plea&s;ure and pain &s;truggling in the &s;ame coun|tenance, as in that of the Lady; &s;o fixed a melan|choly, as in that of the Marquis. Mr. Lowther is a man of &s;pirit, tho' a mode&s;t man. He is, as on every <HI>proper</HI> occa&s;ion I found, a man of piety; and has a heart tender as manly. Such a man, heart and hand, is qualified for a profe&s;&s;ion which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful and certain in the art of healing. He is a man of &s;en&s;e and learning <HI>out</HI> of his profe&s;&s;ion, and happy in his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The two &s;urgeons who now attend Signor Jero|nymo&punc; are both of this country. They were &s;ent for. With the approbation, and at the reque&s;t, of the fa|mily, I pre&s;ented Mr. Lowther to them; but fir&s;t gave them his character, as a mode&s;t man, as a man of &s;kill, and experience; and told them, that he had quitted bu&s;ine&s;s, and wanted not either fame or for|tune.</P>
<P>They acquainted him with the ca&s;e, and their me|thods of proceeding. Mr. Lowther a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the dre&s;&s;ings that very evening. Jeronymo would have me to be pre&s;ent. Mr. Lowther &s;ugge&s;ted an altera|tion in their method, but in &s;o ea&s;y and gentle a man|ner, as if he doubted not, but <HI>&s;uch</HI> was their inten|tion when the &s;tate of the wounds would admit of that method of treatment, that the gentlemen came readily into it. A great deal of matter had been col|lected, by means of the wrong methods pur&s;ued; and he propo&s;ed, if the patient's &s;trength would bear it, to make an aperture below the principal wound, in order to di&s;charge the matter downward; and he &s;ug|ge&s;ted the dre&s;&s;ing with hollow tents and bandage, and to di&s;mi&s;s the large tents, with which they had been accu&s;tomed to di&s;tend the wound, to the extreme an|gui&s;h of the patient, on pretence of keeping it open, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;charge.</P>
<P>Let me now give you, my dear friend, a brief hi&s;tory of my Jeronymo's ca&s;e, and of the circum|&s;tances
<PB N="282" REF="283">
which have attended it; by which you will be able to account for the difficulties of it, and how it has happened, that, in &s;uch a &s;pace of time, either the cure was not effected, or that the patient yielded not to the common de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>In lingering ca&s;es, patients or their friends are &s;ome|times too apt to blame their phy&s;icians, and to li&s;ten to new recommendations. The &s;urgeons attending this unhappy ca&s;e, had been more than once changed. Signor Jeronymo, it &s;eems, was un&s;kilfully treated by the young &s;urgeon of Cremona, who was fir&s;t en|gaged: He neglected the mo&s;t dangerous wound; and when he attended to it, managed it wrong, for want of experience. He was therefore very properly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The unhappy man had at fir&s;t three wounds: One in his brea&s;t, which had been for &s;ome time healed; one in his &s;houlder, which, through his own impa|tience, having been too &s;uddenly healed up, was ob|liged to be laid open again; the other, which is the mo&s;t dangerous, in the hip-joint.</P>
<P>A &s;urgeon of this place, and another of Padua, were next employed. The cure not advancing, a &s;urgeon of eminence, from Paris, was &s;ent for.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther tells me, that this man's method was by far the mo&s;t eligible; but that he undertook too much; &s;ince, from the fir&s;t, there could not be any hope, from the nature of the wound in the hip-joint, that the patient could ever walk, without &s;ticks or crutches: And of this opinion were the other two &s;ur|geons: But the French gentleman was &s;o very prag|matical, that he would neither draw with them, nor give rea&s;ons for what he did; regarding them only as his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. They could not long bear this u&s;age, and gave up to him in di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>How cruel is punctilio, among men of this &s;cience, in ca&s;es of difficulty and danger!</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent operators, when the two others had
<PB N="283" REF="284">
given up, were not, but by leave of the French gen|tleman, called in. He valuing him&s;elf on his practice in the Royal Ho&s;pital of Invalids at Paris, looked up|on them as <HI>Theori&s;ts</HI> only; and treated them with as little ceremony as he had &s;hewn the others: So that at la&s;t, from their frequent differences, it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary to part with either him, or them. His pride, when he knew that this que&s;tion was a &s;ubject of de|bate, would not allow him to leave the family an option. He made his demand: It was complied with; and he returned to Paris.</P>
<P>From what this gentleman threw out at parting, to the di&s;paragement of the two others, Signor Jero|nymo &s;u&s;pected their &s;kill; and from a hint of this &s;u&s;picion, as &s;oon as I knew I &s;hould be welcome my&s;elf, I procured the favour of Mr. Lowther's at|tendance.</P>
<P>All Mr. Lowther's fear is, that Signor Jeronymo has been kept too long in hand by the different ma|nagements of the &s;everal operators; and that he will &s;ink under the nece&s;&s;ary proce&s;s, through weakne&s;s of habit. But, however, he is of opinion, that it is requi&s;ite to confine him to a &s;trict dict, and to deny him wine and fermented liquors, in which he has hi|therto been indulged, again&s;t the opinion of his own operators, who have been too complai&s;ant to his ap|petite.</P>
<P>An operation &s;omewhat &s;evere was performed on his &s;houlder ye&s;terday morning. The Italian &s;urgeons complimented Mr. Lowther with the lancet. They both prai&s;ed his dexterity; and Signor Jeronymo, who will be con&s;ulted on every-thing that he is to &s;uffer, ble&s;&s;ed his gentle hand.</P>
<P>At Mr. Lowther's reque&s;t, a phy&s;ician was ye&s;ter|day con&s;ulted; who advi&s;ed &s;ome gentle aperitives, as his &s;trength will bear it; and &s;ome bal&s;amics, to &s;weeten the blood and juices.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther told me ju&s;t now, that the fault of
<PB N="284" REF="285">
the gentlemen who have now the care of him, has not been want of &s;kill, but of <HI>critical</HI> courage, and a too great &s;olicitude to oblige their patient; which, by their own account, had made them forego &s;everal opportunities which had offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature. In &s;hort, Sir, &s;aid he, your friend knows too much of his own ca&s;e to be ruled, and too little to qualify him to direct what is to be done, e&s;pecially as &s;ymptoms mu&s;t have been frequently changing.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther doubts not, he &s;ays, but he &s;hall &s;oon convince Jeronymo that he merits his confidence, and then he will exact it from him; and, in &s;o doing, &s;hall not only give weight to his own endeavours to &s;erve him, but rid the other two gentlemen of em|barra&s;ments which have often given them diffidencies, when re&s;olution was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Mean time the Marquis, his Lady, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, are delighted with Mr. Low|ther. They <HI>will</HI> flatter them&s;elves, they &s;ay, with hopes of their Jeronymo's recovery; which however Mr. Lowther, for fear of di&s;appointment, does not encourage. Jeronymo him&s;elf owns, that his &s;pirits are much revived; and we all know the power that the mind has over the body.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you, my reverend friend, a ge|neral notion of Jeronymo's ca&s;e, as I under&s;tand it from Mr. Lowther's <HI>as</HI> general repre&s;entation of it.</P>
<P>The family have prevailed upon him to accept of an apartment adjoining to that of his patient. Jero|nymo &s;aid, that when he knows he has &s;o &s;kilful a friend near him, he &s;hall go to re&s;t with confidence; and good re&s;t is of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to him.</P>
<P>What a happine&s;s, my dear Dr. Bartlett, will fall to my &s;hare, if I may be an humble in&s;trument, in the hand of Providence, to heal this brother; and if his recovery &s;hall lead the way to the re&s;toration of his &s;i&s;ter; each &s;o known a lover of the other, that the world is more ready to attribute her malady to his
<PB N="285" REF="286">
misfortune and danger, than to any other cau&s;e! But how early days are the&s;e, on which my love and my compa&s;&s;ion for per&s;ons &s;o meritorious, embolden me to build hopes &s;o forward!</P>
<P>Lady Clementina is now impatiently expected by every one. She is at Urbino The General and his Lady are with her. His haughty &s;pirit cannot bear to think &s;he &s;hould &s;ee me, or that my attendance on her &s;hould be thought of &s;o much importance to her.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, in a conver&s;ation that I have ju&s;t now had with her, hinted this to me, and be&s;ought me to keep my temper, if his high notion of family and female honour &s;hould carry him out of his u&s;ual politene&s;s.</P>
<P>I will give you, my dear friend, the particulars of this conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>She began with &s;aying, that &s;he did not, for her part, now think, that her beloved daughter, whom once &s;he believed hardly any private man could de|&s;erve, was worthy of me, even were &s;he to recover her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I could not but gue&s;s the meaning of &s;o high a com|pliment. What an&s;wer could I return that would not, on one hand be capable of being thought <HI>cool;</HI> on the other of being &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>intere&s;ted,</HI> and as if I were looking forward to a reward that &s;ome of the family &s;till think too high? But while I knew my own motives, I could not be di&s;plea&s;ed with a Lady who was not at liberty to act, in this point, according to her own will.</P>
<P>I only &s;aid (and it was with truth) That the cala|mity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">le Lady had endeared her to me, more than it was po&s;&s;ible the mo&s;t pro&s;perous fortune could have done.</P>
<P>I, my good Chevalier, may &s;ay any-thing to you. We are undetermined about every&punc;thing. We know not what to propo&s;e, what to con&s;ent to. Your
<PB N="286" REF="287">
journey, on the fir&s;t motion, tho' but from &s;ome of us, the dear creature continuing ill; you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, exerci&s;ing your&s;elf in doing good in your native country [You mu&s;t think we took all op|portunities of enquiring a&s;ter the man once &s;o likely to be one of us]; the fir&s;t fortune in Italy, Olivia, tho' &s;he is not a Clementina, pur&s;uing you in hopes of cal|ling her&s;elf yours (for to England we hear &s;he went, and there you own &s;he is) What obligations have you laid upon us!&mdash;What <HI>can</HI> we determine upon? What can we <HI>wi&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>Providence and you, madam, &s;hall direct my &s;teps&punc; I am in yours and your Lord's power. The &s;ame uncertainty, from the &s;ame unhappy cau&s;e, leaves me not the <HI>thought,</HI> becau&s;e not the <HI>power</HI> of determina|tion. The recovery of Lady Clementina and her bro|ther without a view to my own intere&s;t, fills up, at pre|&s;ent, all the wi&s;hes of my heart.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, &s;aid the Lady (it is for my own private &s;atisfaction) Were &s;uch a happy event, as to Clemen|tina, to take place, could you, would you, think your|&s;elf bound by your former offers?</P>
<P>When I made tho&s;e offers, madam, the &s;ituation on your &s;ide was the &s;ame that it is now: Lady Clemen|tina was unhappy in her mind. My fortune, it is true, is higher: It is indeed as high as I wi&s;h it to be. I <HI>then</HI> declared, That if you would give me your Clemen|tina, without in&s;i&s;ting on one hard, on one indi&s;pen&s;a|ble article, I would renounce her fortune, and tru&s;t to my father's goodne&s;s to me for a provi&s;ion. Shall my acce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tate of my ance&s;tors alter me?&mdash;No! madam: I never yet made an offer, that I receded from, the circum&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ontinuing the &s;ame. If, in the article of re&s;idence, the Marquis, and you, and Clementina, would relax; I would acknowlege my|&s;elf indebted to your goodne&s;s, but without condition|ing for it.</P>
<P>I told you, &s;aid &s;he, that I put this que&s;tion only
<PB N="287" REF="288">
for my own private &s;atisfaction: And I told you truth. I never will deceive or mi&s;lead you. Whenever I &s;peak to you, it &s;hall be as if, even in your own con|cerns, I &s;poke to a third per&s;on; and I &s;hall not doubt but you will have the genero&s;ity to advi&s;e, as <HI>&s;uch,</HI> tho' again&s;t your&s;elf.</P>
<P>May I be enabled to act worthy of your good opi|nion! I madam, look upon my&s;elf as bound: You and yours are free.</P>
<P>What a plea&s;ure is it, my dear Dr. Bartlett, to the proud heart of your friend, that I <HI>could</HI> &s;ay this!&mdash;Had I &s;ought, in pur&s;uance of my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">inations, to engage the affections of the admirable Mi&s;s Byron, as I might with honour have endeavoured to do, had not the woes of this noble family, and the unhappy &s;tate of mind of their Clementina, &s;o deeply affected me; I might have involved my&s;elf, and that lovelie&s;t of women, in difficulties which would have made &s;uch a heart as mine &s;till more unhappy than it is.</P>
<P>Let me know, my dear Dr. Bartlett, that Mi&s;s By|ron is happy. I rejoice, whatever be my own de&s;tiny, that I have not involved her in my uncertainties. The Counte&s;s of D. is a worthy woman: The Earl, her &s;on, is a good young man: Mi&s;s Byron merits &s;uch a mother; the Counte&s;s &s;uch a daughter. How dear, how important, is her welfare to me!&mdash;You know your Grandi&s;on, my good Dr. Bartlett. Her friend|&s;hip I pre&s;umed to a&s;k: I dared not to wi&s;h to corre&s;|pond with her. I rejoice, for her &s;ake, that I tru&s;t|ed not my heart with &s;uch a propo&s;al What difficul|ties, my dear friend, have I had to encounter with!&mdash;God be prai&s;ed, that I have nothing, with regard to the&s;e two incomparable women, to reproach my&s;elf with. I am per&s;uaded that our prudence, if ra&s;hly we throw not our&s;elves into difficulties, and if we will exert it, and make a reliance on the proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is generally proportioned to our trials.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked the Marchione&s;s after Lady Sforza, and her daughter Laurana; and whether they were at Milan?</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
You have heard, no doubt, an&s;wered &s;he, the cruel treatment that my poor child met with from her cou&s;in Laurana. Lady Sforza ju&s;tifies her in it. We are upon extrame bad terms, on that account. They are both at Milan. The General has vowed, that he never will &s;ee them more, if he can avoid it. The Bi&s;hop, only as a Chri&s;tian, can forgive them. You, Cheva|lier, know the rea&s;on why we cannot allow our Cle|mentina to take the veil.</P>
<P>The particular rea&s;ons I have not, madam, been in|qui&s;itive about; but have always under&s;tood them to be family ones, grounded on the dying reque&s;t of one of her grandfathers.</P>
<P>Our daughter, Sir, is intitled to a con&s;iderable e&s;tate which joins to our own domains. It was pur|cha&s;ed for her by her two grandfathers; who vied with each other in demon&s;trating their love of her by &s;olid effects. One of them (my father) was, in his youth, deeply in Love with a young Lady of great merit; and &s;he was thought to love him: But, in a fit of <HI>pious bravery,</HI> as he u&s;ed to call it, when every-thing between them&s;elves, and between the friends on both &s;ides, was concluded on, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a Convent; and, pa&s;&s;ing &s;teadily through the proba|tionary forms, took the veil; but afterwards repented, and took pains to let it be known that &s;he was un|happy. This gave him a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the &s;eque&s;tred life, tho' he was, in other re&s;pects, a zealous Catho|lic. And Clementina having always a &s;erious turn; in order to deter her from embracing it (both grand|fathers being de&s;irous of &s;trengthening their hou&s;e, as well in the female as male line) they in&s;erted a clau&s;e in each of their wills, by which they gave the e&s;tate de&s;igned for her, in ca&s;e &s;he took the veil, to Lau|rana, and her de&s;cendants; Laurana, to enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it on the day that Clementina &s;hould be profe&s;&s;ed. But if Clementina married, Laurana was then to be intitled only to a hand&s;ome legacy, that
<PB N="289" REF="290">
&s;he might not be entirely di&s;ppointed: For the re|ver&s;ion, in ca&s;e Clementina had no children, was to go to our elde&s;t &s;on; who, however, has been always generou&s;ly folicitous to have his &s;i&s;ter marry.</P>
<P>Both grandfathers were rich. Our &s;on Giacomo, on my father's death, as he had willed, entered upon a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in the kingdom of Naples, which had for ages been in my family: He is there|fore, and will be, greatly provided for. Our &s;econd &s;on has great pro&s;pects before him, in the church: But you know he cannot marry. Poor Jeronymo! We had not, <HI>before</HI> his misfortune, any great hopes of &s;trengthening the family by his means: He, alas! (as <HI>you</HI> well know, who took &s;uch laudable pains to reclaim him, before we knew you) with great qua|lities, imbibed free notions from bad company, and declared him&s;elf a de&s;pi&s;er of marriage. This the two grandfathers knew, and often deplored; for Je|ronymo and Clementina were equally their favourites. To him and the Bi&s;hop they bequeathed great le|gacies.</P>
<P>We &s;u&s;pected not, till very lately, that Laurana was deeply in Love with the Count of Belvedere; and that her mother and &s;he had views to drive our &s;weet child into a convent, that Laurana might enjoy the e&s;tate; which they hoped would be an induce|ment to the Count to marry her. Cruel Laurana! Cruel Lady Sforza! So much love as they both pre|tended to our child: and, I believe, <HI>had,</HI> till the temp|tation, &s;trengthened by power, became <HI>too</HI> &s;trong for them. Unhappy the day that we put her into their hands!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the e&s;tate &s;o bequeathed to Clementina, we can do great things for her: Few Italian families are &s;o rich as ours. Her brothers forget their own inte|re&s;t, when it comes into competition with hers: She is as generous as they. Our four children never knew what a contention was, but who &s;hould give up
<PB N="290" REF="291">
an advantage to the other. This child, this &s;weet child, was ever the delight of us all, and likewi&s;e of our brother the Conte della Porretta. What joy would her recovery and nuptials give us!&mdash;dear crea|ture! We have &s;ometimes thought, that &s;he is the fonder of the &s;eque&s;tred life, as it is that which we wi&s;h her not to embrace&mdash;But can Clementina be per|ver&s;e? She cannot. Yet <HI>that</HI> was the life of her choice, when &s;he <HI>had</HI> a choice, her grandfathers wi&s;hes notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Will you now wonder, Chevalier, that neither our &s;ons nor we can allow Clementina to take the veil? Can we &s;o reward Laurana for her cruelty? E&s;pe|cially now, that we &s;u&s;pect the motives for her bar|barity? Could I have thought that my &s;i&s;ter Sforza&mdash;But what will not Love and Avarice do, their powers united to compa&s;s the &s;ame end; the one reigning in the bo&s;om of the mother, the other in that of the daughter? Alas! alas! they have, between them, broken the &s;pirit of my Clementina. The <HI>very</HI> name of Laurana gives her terror&mdash;<HI>So</HI> far is &s;he &s;en&s;ible. But, O Sir, her &s;en&s;ibility appears only when &s;he is har&s;hly treated! To tenderne&s;s &s;he had been too much accu&s;tomed, to make her think an indulgent treatment now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>I dread, my dear Dr. Bartlet, yet am impatient, to &s;ee the unhappy Lady. I wi&s;h the general were not to accompany her. I am afraid I &s;hall want tem|per, if he forget his. My own heart, when it tells me, that I have not de&s;erved ill u&s;age (from my equals and &s;uperiors in rank, e&s;pecially) bids me not bear it. I am a&s;hamed to own to you, my reverend friend, <HI>that</HI> pride of &s;pirit, which, knowing it to be my fault, I ought long ago to have &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>Make my compliments to every one I love. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves are of the number.</P>
<P>Charlotte, I hope is happy. If &s;he is not, it mu&s;t be her own fault. Let her know, that I will not

allow, when my love to both &s;i&s;ters is equal, that &s;he &s;hall give me cau&s;e to &s;ay, that Lady L. is my be&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Lady Olivin gives me unea&s;ine&s;s. I am a&s;hamed, my dear Dr. Bartlett, that a woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nk &s;o con|&s;iderable, and who his &s;ome great qualities, &s;hould lay her&s;elf under obligation to the comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">lion of a man who can <HI>only</HI> pity her. When a woman gets over that delicacy, which is the te&s;t or bulwark as I may &s;ay, of mode&s;ty&mdash;Mode&s;ty it&s;elf may &s;oon lie at the mercy of an enemy.</P>
<P>Tell my Emily that &s;he is never out of my mind; and that, among the other excellent examples &s;he has before her. Mi&s;s Byron's mu&s;t never be out of hers.</P>
<P>Lord L. and Lord G. are in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brotherly love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent write to my Beauchamp. In writing to you, I write to him.</P>
<P>You know all my heart. If in this, or my future Letters, any-thing &s;hould &s;all from my pen, that would po&s;&s;ibly in your opinion affect or give unea&s;ine&s;s to any one I love and honour, were it to be communicated; I depend upon your known and unque&s;tionable di&s;cre|tion to keep it to your&s;elf.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE><HI>May</HI> 11-22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop &s;et out ye&s;terday for Urbino, in order to inform him&s;elf of his &s;i&s;ter's &s;tate of health, and perhaps to qualify the General to meet me with temper and politene&s;s. Were I &s;ure the good prelate thought this nece&s;&s;ary, my pride would be excited.</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere arrived here ye&s;terday. He made it his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee me. He acquainted me, but in confidence&punc; that propo&s;als of marriage with Lady Laurana had actually been made him: To which he had returned an&s;wer, that his heart, however hopele&s;ly was engaged; and that he never could think of any other woman than Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>He made no &s;cruple, he &s;aid, of returning &s;o &s;hort an an&s;wer, becau&s;e he had been appri&s;ed of the cruelty with which one of the noble&s;t young women in Italy had been treated, by the propo&s;ers; and with their motives for it.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Chevalier, &s;aid he, that I am open and un|re&s;erved to you. You will oblige me, if you will let me know what it is you propo&s;e to your-<HI>&s;elf</HI> in the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation?&mdash;But, fir&s;t, I &s;hould be glad to hear from your own mouth, what pa&s;&s;ed between you and Cle|mentina, and the family, before you quitted Italy the la&s;t time. I have had <HI>their</HI> account.</P>
<P>I gave him a very faithful relation of it. He was plea&s;ed with it. Exactly as it has been repre&s;ented to me! &s;aid he. Were Clementina and you of one re|igion, there could have been no hope for any other man. I adore her for her piety, and for her attach|ment to <HI>hers;</HI> and am not &s;o narrow-minded a man, but I can admire you for <HI>yours.</HI> As her malady is ac|cidental, I never w ould think of any other woman

<P>I an&s;wered him as I had done the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed as much plea&s;ed with me as I am with him. He is gone back to Parma.</P>

<P>THE Bi&s;hop is returned. Lady Clementina has been very ill: A fever. How has &s;he been hurried about! He tells me, that the General and his Lady, and al&s;o the Conte della Porretta, acknowlege them|&s;elves and their whole family obliged to me for the trouble I have been at to &s;erve their Jeronymo.</P>
<P>The fever having left Lady Clementina, the will &s;et out in a day or two. The Count and Signor Seba&s;ti|ano, as well as the General and his Lady, will attend her. I am impatient to &s;ee her. Yet how greatly will the &s;ight of her afflict me! The Bi&s;hop &s;ays, &s;he is the picture of &s;ilent woe: Yet, tho' greatly ema|ciated, <HI>looks her&s;elf,</HI> were his words. They told her, that Jeronymo was better than he had been. Your dear Jeronymo, &s;aid the General to her. The &s;weet echo repeated&mdash;Jeronymo&mdash;and was again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>They afterwar's propo&s;ed to name me to her. They did. She looked quick about her, as if for Some|body. Laura, her maid, was occa&s;ionally called up|on. She &s;tarted, and threw her arms about Camilla, as terrified; looking wildly. Camilla doubts not, but by the name Laura, &s;he apprehended the &s;avage Lau|rana to be at hand.</P>
<P>How mu&s;t &s;he have &s;uffered from her barbarity&punc;&mdash;Sweet Innocent! &s;he, who even in her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;veries thought not but of good to the <HI>Soul</HI> of the man whom &s;he honoured with her regard&mdash;She, who bore offence

without re&s;entment; and by meekne&s;s only &s;ought to calm the violence for which &s;he had not given the lea&s;t cau&s;e!</P>
<P>But when Camilla and &s;he had retired, &s;he &s;poke to her. The Bi&s;hop gave me the following dialogue be|tween them, as he had it from Camilla:</P>
<P>Did they not name to me the Chevalier Grandi&s;on? &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>They did, madam.</P>
<P>See! &s;ee! &s;aid &s;he, before I name him again, if my cruel cou&s;in hearken not at the door.</P>
<P>Your cruel cou&s;in, madam, is at many miles di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>She may hear what I &s;ay, for all that.</P>
<P>My dear Lady Clementina, &s;he cannot hear. She &s;hall never more come near you.</P>
<P>So you &s;ay.</P>
<P>Did I ever deceive you, madam?</P>
<P>I can't remember: My memory is gone; quite gone, Camilla.</P>
<P>She then looked earne&s;tly at Camilla, and &s;creamed.</P>
<P>What ails you, my deare&s;t young Lady?</P>
<P>Recovering her&s;elf&mdash;Ah, my own Camilla! It is you. I thought, by the ca&s;t of your eye, you were become Laurana.&mdash;Do not, do not give me &s;uch an|other look!</P>
<P>Camilla was not &s;en&s;ible of any particularity in her looks.</P>
<P>Here you have me again upon a journey, Camilla: But how do I know that I am not to be carried to my cruel cou&s;in?</P>
<P>You are really going to your father's palace at Bo|logna, madam.</P>
<P>Is my mother there?</P>
<P>She is.</P>
<P>Who el&s;e?</P>
<P>The Chevalier, madam.</P>

<P>Poor Jeronymo!</P>
<P>And to pay his compliments to you, madam.</P>

<P>I PASS more than half my time with Signor Jero|nymo; but (that I may not fatigue his &s;pirits) at dif|ferent hours of the day. The Italian &s;urgeons and Mr. Lowther happily agree in all their mea&s;ures: They applaud him when his back is turned; and he &s;peaks well of them in their ab&s;ence. This mutual return of good offices, which they hear of, unites them. The patient declares, that he had not for months been &s;o ea&s;y as now. Every-body attributes a great deal to his heart's being revived by my fre|quent vi&s;its. To-morrow it is propo&s;ed to make an opening below the mo&s;t difficult wound. Mr. Low|ther &s;ays, he will not flatter us, till he &s;ees the &s;ucce&s;s of this operation.</P>

The Marquis and his Lady are inexpre&s;&s;ibly ob|liging to me. I had ye&s;terday a vi&s;it from both, on an indi&s;po&s;ition that confined me to my chamber; occa&s;ioned, I believe, by a hurry of &s;pirits; by fa|tigue; by my apprehen&s;ions for Jeronymo; my con|cern for Clementina; and by my too great anxiety for the dear friends I had &s;o lately left in England.</P>
<P>You know, Dr. Bartlett, that I have a heart too &s;u&s;ceptible for my own peace, tho' I endeavour to <HI>conceal</HI> from <HI>others</HI> tho&s;e painful &s;en&s;ibilities, which they cannot relieve. The poor Olivia was ever to be my di&s;turbance. Mi&s;s Byron mu&s;t be happy in the rectitude of her own heart. I am ready to think, that &s;he will not be able to re&s;i&s;t the warm in&s;tances of the Counte&s;s of D. in favour of her &s;on, who is certainly one of the be&s;t young men among the no|bility.

<P>LAST night arrived Lady Clementina, the Ge|neral, his Lady, the Count, and Signor Seba|&s;tiano.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="298">
I had left Jeronymo about an hour. He had had in the morning the intended opening made by Mr. Lowther. He would have me pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The operation was happily performed: But, thro' weakne&s;s of body, he was &s;everal times in the day troubled with faintings.</P>
<P>I left him tolerably chearful in the evening; and rejoicing in expectation of his &s;i&s;ter's arrival; and&punc; as the Bi&s;hop had a&s;&s;ured him of the General's grateful di&s;po&s;ition, he longed, he &s;aid, to &s;ee that affectionate brother and his Lady once more. He had never but once &s;een her before, and then was &s;o ill, that he could hardly compliment her on the honour &s;he had done their family.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop &s;ent to tell me that his &s;i&s;ter was ar|rived; but that being fatigued and unhappy, Ca|milla &s;hould acquaint me in the morning with the way in which &s;he &s;hould then be.</P>
<P>I &s;lept not half an hour the whole night. You, my dear friend, will ea&s;ily account for my re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;ent, as u&s;ual, early in the morning, to know how Jeronymo re&s;ted. The an&s;wer was favourable; returned by Mr. Lowther, who &s;at up with him that night, at his own motion: He knew not but &s;ome|thing critical might happen.</P>
<P>Camilla came. The good woman was &s;o full of her own joy to &s;ee me once more in Italy, that I could not pre&s;ently get a word from her, of what my heart throbbed with impatience to know.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, You will, &s;aid &s;he, have the General and the Bi&s;hop with you. Ah, Sir! my poor young Lady! What has &s;he &s;uffered &s;ince you left us! You will not know her. We are not &s;ure &s;he will know you. Who &s;hall be able to bear the fir&s;t interview? She has now but few intervals. It is all one gloomy confu&s;ion with her. She cares not to &s;peak to any|body. Every &s;tranger &s;he &s;ees, terrifies her. O the vile, thrice vile Lady Laurana!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
In this manner ran on Camilla: Nor would &s;he enter into any other particulars than the unhappy ones &s;he left me to collect from the broken hints and excla|mations thus thrown out. Alas! thought I, the cala|mities of Clementina have affected the head of the poor Camilla! She hurried away, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be want|ed, and le&s;t the General &s;hould find her with me.</P>
<P>The two brothers came &s;oon after. The General took my hand, with a kind of forced politene&s;s: We are all obliged to you, Sir, &s;aid he, for your Mr. Lowther. Are the &s;urgeons of England &s;o famous? But the people of your nation have been accu&s;tomed to <HI>give</HI> wounds: They &s;hould therefore furni&s;h ope|rators to <HI>heal</HI> them. We are obliged to you al&s;o, for the trouble you have given your&s;elf in coming over to us in per&s;on. Jeronymo has found a revival of &s;pirits upon it: God grant they may not &s;ub&s;ide! But, alas! our &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Poor Clementina!&mdash;She is lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Would to God, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, we had left her to the care of Mrs. Beaumont.</P>
<P>The General him&s;elf, having taken her from Flo|rence, would not join in this wi&s;h. There was a middle cour&s;e, he &s;aid, that ought to have been taken. But Laurana is a daughter of the devil, &s;aid he; and Lady Sforza ought to be dete&s;ted for upholding her.</P>
<P>The General expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with coldne&s;s on my coming over; but &s;aid, that now I was on the &s;pot, and as his &s;i&s;ter had been <HI>formerly</HI> de&s;irous of &s;eeing me, an interview might be permitted, in order to &s;a|tisfy tho&s;e of the family who had given me the invita|tion, which it was very good of me to accept; e&s;peci|ally as I had the Lady Olivia in England attending my motions: But otherwi&s;e he had no opinion&mdash;There he &s;topt.</P>
<P>I looked upon him with indignation, mingled with contempt: And directing my&s;elf to the Bi&s;hop, You
<PB N="299" REF="300">
remember, my Lord, &s;aid I, the &s;tory of Naaman the Syrian <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Kings v.</NOTE></P>
<P>What is that, my Lord? &s;aid he to the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, continued I, &s;till directing my|&s;elf to the Bi&s;hop, to pre&s;ume upon my own con&s;e|quence in the application of the &s;tory: But your Lord&s;hip will judge how far the compari&s;on will hold. Would to God it might <HI>throughout!</HI></P>
<P>A happy allu&s;ion, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. I &s;ay Amen.</P>
<P>I know not who this Naaman is, &s;aid the General, nor what is meant by your allu&s;ion, Chevalier: But by your looks I &s;hould imagine, that you mean <HI>me</HI> con|tempt.</P>
<P>My looks, my Lord, generally indicate my heart. You may make light of my intention; and &s;o will I of the trouble I have been at, if your Lord&s;hip make not light of <HI>me.</HI> But were I, my Lord, in your own palace at Naples, I would tell you, that you &s;eem not to know, in my ca&s;e, what graciou&s;ne&s;s is. Yet I a&s;k not for favour from you, but as much for your own &s;ake, as mine.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop&mdash;My Lord, to his brother&mdash;Did you not promi&s;e me&mdash;Why did you mention Olivia to the Chevalier?</P>
<P>Does that di&s;turb you, Sir? &s;aid the General to me. I cannot make light of a man of your con&s;equence; e&s;pecially with Ladies, Sir&mdash;in a &s;cornful manner.</P>
<P>The General, you &s;ee, my Lord&punc; &s;aid I, turning to the Bi&s;hop, has an in&s;uperable ill-will to me. I found, when I attended him at Naples, that he had harboured &s;urmi&s;es that were as injurious to his &s;i&s;ter, as to me. I was in hopes that I had obviated them; but a rooted malevolence will recur. However, &s;atis|fied as I am with my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, he &s;hall, for <HI>many &s;akes,</HI> find it very difficult to provoke me.</P>
<P>For <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, among the re&s;t, Chevalier? with an air of drollery.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301">
You are at liberty, returned I, to make your own con&s;tructions. Allow me, my Lords, to attend you to Signor Jeronymo.</P>
<P>Not till you are cordial friends, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop&mdash;Brother, give me your hand, offering to take it&mdash;Chevalier, yours&mdash;</P>
<P>Di&s;po&s;e of mine as you plea&s;e, my Lord, &s;aid I, holding it out.</P>
<P>He took it and the General's at the &s;ame time, and would have joined them.</P>
<P>Come, my Lord, &s;aid I, to the General, and &s;natched his reluctant hand, accept of a friendly offer, from a heart as friendly. Let me honour you, from my <HI>own knowlege,</HI> for tho&s;e great qualities which the world gives you. I demand your favour from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I de&s;erve it; and <HI>that</HI> I could not, were I to &s;ubmit to be treated with indignity by any man. I &s;hould be &s;orry to look little in <HI>your</HI> eyes; but I will not in <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>Who can bear the &s;uperiority this man a&s;&s;umes, brother?</P>
<P>You <HI>oblige</HI> me, my Lord, to a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Chevalier &s;peaks nobly, my Lord. His cha|racter is well known. Let me lead you both friends to our Jeronymo. But &s;ay, Brother,&mdash;Say, Chevalier, that you are &s;o.</P>
<P>I cannot bear, &s;aid the General, that the Chevalier Grandi&s;on &s;hould imagine him&s;elf of &s;o much con|&s;equence to my &s;i&s;ter, as &s;ome of you &s;eem to think him.</P>
<P>You know me not, my Lord. I have at pre&s;ent no wi&s;h but for the recovery of your &s;i&s;ter and Signor Jeronymo. Were I able to be of &s;ervice to them, that &s;ervice would be my reward. But, my Lord, if it will make you ea&s;y, and induce you to treat me, as my own heart tells me I <HI>ought</HI> to be treated; I will give you my honour, and let me &s;ay, that it never yet was forfeited, that whatever turn your &s;i&s;ter's
<PB N="301" REF="302">
malady may take, I will not accept of the heighe&s;t fa|vour that can be done me, but with the joint con&s;ent of the three brothers, as well as of your father and mother. Permit me to add, that I will not enter into any family that &s;hall think meanly of me; nor &s;ubject the woman I love to the contempt of her own rela|tions.</P>
<P>This indeed is nobly &s;aid, replied the General. Give me your hand upon it, and I am your friend for ever.</P>
<P>Proud man! He could not bear to think, that a &s;umple Engli&s;h gentleman, as he looks upon me to be, &s;hould ally with their family; improbable as it is, in his own opinion, that the unhappy Lady &s;hould ever recover her rea&s;on: But he greatly loves the Count of Belvedere; and all the family was fond of an alliance with that de&s;erving nobleman.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop rejoiced to find us at la&s;t in a better way of under&s;tanding each other, than we had hitherto been in; and it was ea&s;ier for me to allow for this haughty man, as Mrs. Beaumont had let me know what the behaviour was that I had to expect from him: And indeed, his father, mother, and two bro|thers, were very apprehen&s;ive of it: It will therefore be a plea&s;ure to them, that I have &s;o ea&s;ily overcome his prejudices.</P>
<P>They both advi&s;ed me to &s;u&s;pend my vi&s;it to their brother till the afternoon, that they might have the more time to con&s;ult with one another, and to prepare and di&s;po&s;e their &s;i&s;ter to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>At taking leave, the General &s;natched my hand, and, with an air of plea&s;antry, &s;aid, I have a wife, Grandi&s;on. I wi&s;hed him joy. You need not, &s;aid he; for I <HI>have</HI> it: One of the be&s;t of women. She longs to &s;ee you. I think I need not be apprehen&s;ive, becau&s;e <HI>&s;he</HI> is generous, and <HI>I</HI> ever mu&s;t be grateful: But take care, take care, Grandi&s;on! I &s;hall watch every turn of your eye. Admire her, if you will:
<PB N="302" REF="303">
You will not be able to help it. But I am glad &s;he &s;aw you not before &s;he was mine.</P>
<P>I rejoice, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, that a meeting, which, notwith&s;tanding your <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> brother, gave me ap|prehen&s;ions as we came, is followed by &s;o plea&s;ant a parting: Henceforth we are four Brothers again.</P>
<P>Ay, and remember, Chevalier, that my <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> has al&s;o <HI>four</HI> Brothers.</P>
<P>May the number Four not be le&s;&s;ened by the death of my Jeronymo; and may Clementina be re&s;tored; and Providence di&s;po&s;e as it plea&s;es of me! I am now going to the palace of Porretta; with what agitations of mind, you, Dr. Bartlett, can better imagine, than I de&s;cribe.</P>
