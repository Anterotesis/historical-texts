<HEAD>SONG IN PRAISE OF WOMAN.</HEAD>

<L>MY temples with clu&s;ters of grapes I'll entwine,</L>

<L>But &s;top and forget her at Bacchus's tun.</L>

<L>Yet why this re&s;olve to relinqui&s;h the fair?</L>

<L>Grows convert to love, and re&s;igns her his key.</L>

<L>Then bring me a goblet from Bacchus's hoard,</L>
<L>The large&s;t, and deepe&s;t, that &s;tands on the board:</L>

<L>DEar Gem, I'll help you to a hint,</L>
<L>Which never yet appear'd in print,</L>
<L>That mo&s;t infallibly &s;ecures</L>
<L>The favour of the&s;e dread Reviewers:</L>
<L>Fir&s;t then get paper, pen and ink,</L>
<L>Ne'er take the needle&s;s pains to think,</L>
<L>But dip your quill, and write away,</L>
<L>No matter&mdash;poem or e&s;&s;ay;</L>
<L>Fill up your pages plenius, plenius,</L>
<L>Again&s;t all judgment, and all genius;</L>
<L>And &s;oon you'll view, with plea&s;ing look,</L>
<L>Your labour &s;well'd into a book:</L>
<L>North-Briti&s;h Strahan mu&s;t be your printer&punc;</L>
<L>He'll get your work di&s;patch'd by winter;</L>

<L>Tho' you, with common &s;en&s;e at &s;trife,</L>
<L>Write dull as Griffiths, or his wife,</L>

<L>But I, whom no &s;uch fools can awe,</L>
<L>Who mind not all they &s;ay a &s;traw,</L>

<L>Should deem it honour to be damn'd:</L>
