<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the very moment, when I was concluding the Notes to this Elegy, I received an Elegiac Poem on the &s;ame &s;ubject, by a Gentleman, who&s;e exten&s;ive knowledge of Indian Literature, and who&s;e acquaint|ance with its lamented Patron, induced me to peru&s;e his Publication with peculiar eagerne&s;s. There is &s;o much poetical merit in the animated and graceful tribute, which Mr. MAURICE has paid to the me|mory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, that, had I &s;een it before the completion of the&s;e Stanzas, it might have induced me to relinqui&s;h a &s;ubject pre|engaged by a Writer &s;o peculiarly qualified to treat it with &s;ucce&s;s. Yet the literary excellence of Sir WILLIAM JONES appears to require &s;ome kind of homage from every man of letters; and by the &s;pirit of Mr. MAURICE'S performance, I am per&s;uaded, that our common regard for the Character we commemorate, is &s;o &s;incere and ingenuous, that we mu&s;t rejoice in a multiplicity of offerings to a name &s;o entitled to univer+&s;al prai&s;e.</P>

<P>THE erudition of Sir WILLIAM JONES was admirable not only from its extraordinary extent, but from having been acquired, to an a&s;toni&s;hing degree, at a very early period of life. <Q>Before the expiration of his twenty-&s;econd year (&s;ays his friend and eulo|gi&s;t) he had compleated his Commentaries on the Poetry of the A&s;iatics, although a con&s;iderable time afterwards elap&s;ed before their publication.</Q> Sir JOHN proceeds to commend this work very ju&s;tly, as a compleat proof of the Author's con&s;ummate &s;kill in a variety of languages, and as a juvenile monument of ta&s;te, ta|lents, and application, without example. Let me add, that this early production di&s;covers al&s;o a heart full of gentle affections, and a mind that already conceived and expre&s;&s;ed its ideas with &s;ingular energy and freedom. I allude particularly to the very pathetic tri|bute of gratitude and prai&s;e, which the Author paid, in his Prooe|mium, to his friend and in&s;tructor, then recently decea&s;ed, (RO|BERT SUMNER, the ma&s;ter of Harrow &s;chool) and to the two fol|lowing pa&s;&s;ages of the book; in the fir&s;t he is &s;peaking of &s;atire, in the &s;econd of heroic poetry. <Q>Atqui ut aperte dicam quod &s;entio, valde invitus in poetarum chorum &s;atyricos, ut vocan|tur, a&s;cribo.

<P>THE life of NADER SHAH, an Ea&s;tern Manu&s;cript, brought to England by the King of Denmark.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"What generous plaints of indignation bur&s;t."</HEAD>
<P>THIS ver&s;e alludes to the following pa&s;&s;age, towards the clo&s;e of an admirable Preface to the Life of NADER SHAH, new modelled for the benefit of the Engli&s;h reader, and publi&s;hed in 1773:</P>
<Q><PB N="26" REF="26">
It is a painful con&s;ideration, that the profe&s;&s;ion of Literature, by far the mo&s;t laborious of any, leads to no real benefit or true glory what&s;oever. Poetry, Science, Letters, when they are not made the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of life, may become its ornaments in pro&s;|perity, and its mo&s;t plea&s;ing con&s;olation in a change of fortune; but if a man addicts him&s;elf entirely to learning, and hopes by <HI>that</HI> either to rai&s;e a family, or to acquire, what &s;o many wi&s;h for, and &s;o few ever attain, an honourable retirement in his declining age, he will find, when it is too late, that he has mi&s;taken his path; that other labours, other &s;tudies are nece&s;|&s;ary; and that unle&s;s he can a&s;&s;ert his own independence in active life, it will avail him little to be favoured by the learned, e&s;teemed by the eminent, or recommended even by kings.</Q>
<P>The&s;e reflections can hardly be &s;ugge&s;ted too frequently to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e ingenuous youths, who happen to have con|ceived a very ardent pa&s;&s;ion for literature. It was happy for our great Orientali&s;t, that his own peculiar energy of mind enabled him to form &s;uch reflections at an early period of life, before the gates of profe&s;&s;ional pro&s;perity were barred again&s;t his laudable ambition; otherwi&s;e it is but too probable, that with unexampled hoards of erudition, united to a mo&s;t benevolent temper, he might have pined in a &s;tate of neglect and mortification, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to be one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous and mo&s;t u&s;eful characters in the poli&s;hed age, which his writings have contributed to enlighten and adorn.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this note without remarking, that the Preface to the Engli&s;h Life of NADER SHAH, which gave ri&s;e to it, contains many excellent remarks on hi&s;torical writing. It was the cu&s;tom of our univer&s;al &s;cholar to delineate, in a philo&s;ophic and ma&s;terly &s;urvey, the province of literature, to which the object of his im|mediate labour belonged. Thus to his volume of A&s;iatic Poems he has added two admirable E&s;&s;ays on Poetry; and his tran&s;lation of ISAEUS is elucidated by a prefatory di&s;cour&s;e, and a commentary
<PB N="27" REF="27">
replete with legal and cla&s;&s;ical information. As a writer, both of ver&s;e and pro&s;e, his con&s;ummate knowledge of languages enabled him to vary and adapt his &s;tyle to his &s;ubject with all the graces of exqui&s;ite propriety.</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
"When I was at &s;ea la&s;t Augu&s;t, on my voyage to this country, which I had long and ardently de&s;ired to vi&s;it, I found one even|ing, on in&s;pecting the ob&s;ervations of the day, that India lay be|fore us, and Per&s;ia on our left, while a breeze from Arabia blew nearly on our &s;tern. A &s;ituation &s;o plea&s;ing in it&s;elf, and to me &s;o new, could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in a mind, which had early been accu&s;tomed to contemplate with delight the eventful hi&s;tories, and agreeable fictions of this Ea&s;tern world. It gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to find my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of &s;o noble an amphitheatre, almo&s;t encircled by the va&s;t regions of A&s;ia, which has ever been e&s;teemed the nur&s;e of &s;ciences, the in|ventre&s;s of delightful and u&s;eful arts, the &s;cene of glorious actions, fertile in the productions of human genius, abounding in natural wonders, and infinitely diver&s;ified in the forms of religion and go|vernment, in the laws, manners, cu&s;toms, and languages, as well as in the features and complexions of men; I could not help remark|ing how important and exten&s;ive a field was yet unexplored, and how many &s;olid advantages unimproved."&mdash;<HI>A&s;iatick Re&s;earches,</HI> vol. i. p. 9.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections led Sir WILLIAM, by degrees, to the founda|tion of the A&s;iatic Society, and never was a man more happily qualified, by nature and education, to be the founder and the guide of &s;uch a re&s;pectable in&s;titution; &s;ince, in addition to his own &s;in|gular talents for the rapid acqui&s;ition and ready communication of knowledge, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch engaging manners as en|abled him mo&s;t happily to call forth and encourage the faculties of all around him. His unrivalled erudition was &s;o far from ren|dering him dogmatical or repul&s;ive, that no man ever &s;poke with more genuine mode&s;ty of his own merit; no man could exert more candour and liberality in e&s;timating the merit of others. In his writings, the rare extent of his knowledge is always accom|panied by an equally rare &s;weetne&s;s and genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, which give a peculiar charm to his compo&s;ition, whenever he has occa|&s;ion
<PB N="29" REF="29">
to mention an author di&s;tingui&s;hed in the branch of literature immediately before him. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this &s;pirit occurs to my recollection in his E&s;&s;ay on the Law of Bailments, where he de&s;cribes the legal treati&s;es of a venerable French profe&s;&s;or and judge, M. Pothier, in a &s;train of applau&s;e uncommonly animated and graceful.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"But from thy toil's variety and weight."</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Student may find a mo&s;t plea&s;ing incentive to mental exertion, in contemplating the very wonderful literary acqui&s;itions and atchievements of Sir WILLIAM JONES; a regular and minute enumeration and e&s;timate of the&s;e we may hope to &s;ee from the lei&s;ure of &s;ome accompli&s;hed individual among his many A&s;iatic friends, whom an intimate acquaintance with his exten&s;ive labours, and an equal affection for his endearing virtues, may engage in the office of his Biographer. The Memorial of Sir JOHN SHORE is an excellent prelude to &s;uch a work. Sir JOHN, after mention|ing his predece&s;&s;or's mo&s;t remarkable productions, in&s;erts in his di&s;cour&s;e a paper entitled <HI>"De&s;iderata,"</HI> a li&s;t of 23 curious and important projected works, relating to India, Arabia, China, and Tartary. On this paper of his departed friend he makes the fol|lowing ob&s;ervation:</P>
<P>"We are not authorized to conclude, that he had him&s;elf form|ed a determination to compleat the works which his genius and knowledge had thus &s;ketched; the ta&s;k &s;eems to require a period beyond the probable duration of any human life; but we, who had the happine&s;s to know Sir WILLIAM JONES, who were wit|ne&s;&s;es of his indefatigable per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit of know|ledge, and of his ardour to accompli&s;h whatever he deemed im|portant: who &s;aw the extent of his intellectual powers, his won|derful attainments in literature and &s;cience, and the facility with
<PB N="30" REF="30">
which all his compo&s;itions were made, cannot doubt, if it had plea&s;ed Providence to protract the date of his exi&s;tence, that he would have ably executed much of what he had &s;o exten&s;ively planned.</P>
<P>It cannot be deemed u&s;ele&s;s or &s;uperfluous to enquire, by what arts or method he was enabled to attain to a degree of know|ledge almo&s;t univer&s;al, and apparently beyond the powers of man, during a li&s;e little exceeding forty-&s;even years.</P>
<P>"The faculties of his mind, by nature vigorous, were improved by con&s;tant exerci&s;e, and his memory, by habitual practice, had acquired a capacity of retaining whatever had been once impre&s;&s;ed upon it. To an unextingui&s;hed ardour for univer&s;al knowledge, he joined a per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit of it, which &s;ubdued all ob&s;tacles; his &s;tudies began with the dawn, and during the inter|mi&s;&s;ion of profe&s;&s;ional duties, were continued throughout the day. Reflection and meditation &s;trengthened and confirmed what indu&s;|try and inve&s;tigation had accumulated. It was a fixt principle with him, from which he never voluntarily deviated, not to be deterred, by any difficulties that were &s;urmountable, from pro&s;e|cuting to a &s;ucce&s;sful termination, what he had once deliberately undertaken.</P>
<P>"But what appears to me to have enabled him to employ his ta|lents &s;o much to his own and the public advantage, was the regu|lar allotment of his time to particular occupations, and a &s;crupu|lous adherence to the di&s;tribution which he had fixed; hence all his &s;tudies were pur&s;ued without interruption or confu&s;ion. Nor can I here omit remarking, what may probably have attracted your ob&s;ervation as well as mine, the candour and complacency with which he gave his attention to all per&s;ons, of what&s;oever quality, talent, or education: he ju&s;tly concluded, that curious or important information might be gained from the illiterate; and wherever it was to be obtained, he &s;ought and &s;eized it."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
In the very brief li&s;t of eminent men, who have compleatly united the oppo&s;ite advantages ari&s;ing from a life of bu&s;ine&s;s and a life of meditation, perhaps Cicero is the per&s;onage, who may be mo&s;t properly compared with Sir WILLIAM JONES. The great Roman has been often con&s;idered as without a parallel in the di|ver&s;ity and magnitude of his mental accompli&s;hments; yet who will now he&s;itate to declare, that, in extent of erudition, in elegance and energy of mind, and above all in the tenderne&s;s and integrity of his private and public life, he was far from being &s;uperior to our accompli&s;hed countryman.</P>

<P>IN addre&s;&s;ing his noble young friend on the mo&s;t joyous occa|&s;ion, the high toned &s;pirit of the Poet led him to blend indignant &s;entiments of public virtue with the gaiety of a nuptial &s;ong.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"Menu and Calida&s;a, grace the &s;cene."</HEAD>
<P>FROM an ardent and truly noble de&s;ire to befriend the natives of that country, where he was appointed to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, Sir WILLIAM JONES was led "to &s;ugge&s;t to government a work of national utility and importance, the compilation of a copious dige&s;t of Hindu and Mahommedan laws, from San&s;crit and Arabic originals, with an offer of his &s;ervices to &s;uperintend the compi|lation, and with a promi&s;e to tran&s;late it.&mdash;To the &s;uperinten|dance of this work, which was immediately undertaken at his &s;ugge&s;tion, he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly devoted tho&s;e hours, which he could &s;pare from his profe&s;&s;ional duties.</P>
<P>"During the cour&s;e of this compilation, and as auxiliary to it, he was led to &s;tudy the works of MENU, reputed by the Hindus to be the olde&s;t and holie&s;t of legi&s;lators, and finding them to com|prize a &s;y&s;tem of religious and civil duties, and of law in all its branches, &s;o comprehen&s;ive and minutely exact, that it might be con&s;idered as the in&s;titutes of Hindu law, he pre&s;ented a tran&s;la|tion of them to the government of Bengal."&mdash;<HI>Sir John Shore's Di&s;|cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>When Sir WILLIAM JONES enquired of "a very &s;en&s;ible Brah|man which of the Indian dramas was mo&s;t univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, he an&s;wered without he&s;itation Sacontala, &s;upporting his opinion, as u&s;ual among the Pandits, by a couplet to this effect:</P>
<P>"The Ring of Sacontala, in which the 4th act, and four &s;tanzas of that act are eminently brilliant, di&s;plays all the rich ex|uberance of Calida&s;a's genius."</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance induced our great Orientali&s;t to peru&s;e and tran&s;late Sacontala, which he has given to the public, to u&s;e his own very ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, "as a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and authentic pic|ture of old Hindu manners, and one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities that

<P>A MILD and rational piety may be regarded as the crowning excellence of a character compleatly accompli&s;hed. This excel|lence was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a very happy degree, by the incomparable per&s;onage, to who&s;e honour this imperfect memorial is affection|ately devoted. I cite with peculiar plea&s;ure, on this article, the te&s;|timony of his intelligent and worthy eulogi&s;t (Sir JOHN SHORE) who, having mentioned the marvellous variety and extent of his predece&s;&s;or's mental powers, ob&s;erves, that "from the mo&s;t renowned poets and philo&s;ophers of Greece, Rome, and A&s;ia, he could turn, with equal delight and knowledge, to the &s;ublime &s;pe|culations of BARROW and NEWTON. With them al&s;o he profe&s;&s;ed his conviction of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion; and he ju&s;tly deemed it no incon&s;iderable advantage, that his re&s;earches had cor|roborated the multiplied evidence of revelation, by confirming the Mo&s;aic account of the primitive world."</P>
<P>Let me add, that it is po&s;&s;ible he may have rendered infinitely greater &s;ervices to religion by the admirable &s;ugge&s;tion in the clo&s;e of his Di&s;cour&s;e on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India. He

there points out what occurred to him as the only promi&s;ing mode of converting the Mu&s;ulmans and Hindus to Chri&s;tianity; and perhaps the mo&s;t worthy honour, which the A&s;iatic Society could pay to the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, would be to re&s;ume and realize his idea: the experiment is ea&s;y, and &s;hould it &s;ucceed in any degree, that &s;ucce&s;s will form the noble&s;t eulogy of the beneficent &s;pirit, by whom it was &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
