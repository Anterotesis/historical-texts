<LG>
<L>DEIGN, &s;aint-like tenant of the dale,</L>
<L>To guide my nightly way</L>
<L>To yonder fire, that chears the vale</L>
<L>With ho&s;pitable ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For here, de&s;erted, as I tread</L>
<L>With fainting &s;teps and &s;low,</L>
<L>The wild, immea&s;urably &s;pread,</L>
<L>Seems lengthening as I go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forbear, my &s;on, the &s;age replies,</L>
<L>To tempt the lonely gloom,</L>
<L>For yonder faithle&s;s phantom flies</L>
<L>To lure thee to thy doom.</L>

<PB N="2" REF="2">
<L>Here to the hou&s;ele&s;s child of want</L>
<L>My door is open &s;till,</L>
<L>And tho' my portion is but &s;cant,</L>
<L>I give it with good will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then turn to-night, and freely &s;hare</L>
<L>Whate'er my cell be&s;tows,</L>
<L>My ru&s;hy couch and frugal fare,</L>
<L>My ble&s;&s;ing and repo&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No flocks, that range the valley free,</L>
<L>To &s;laughter I condemn;</L>
<L>Taught by that Power that pities me,</L>
<L>I learn to pity them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But from the mountain's gra&s;&s;y &s;ide</L>
<L>A guiltle&s;s fea&s;t I bring,</L>
<L>A &s;crip with herbs and fruits &s;upply'd,</L>
<L>And water from the &s;pring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then turn to-night, thy cares forego,</L>
<L>All earth-born cares are wrong;</L>
<L>"Man wants but little here below,</L>
<L>"Nor wants that little long."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soft as the dew from heav'n de&s;cends,</L>
<L>His gentle accents fell,</L>
<L>The mode&s;t &s;tranger lowly bends,</L>
<L>And follows to the cell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<L>Far in a wilderne&s;s ob&s;cure</L>
<L>The lonely man&s;ion lay,</L>
<L>A refuge to th' un&s;helter'd poor</L>
<L>And &s;trangers led a&s;tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No &s;tores beneath its humble thatch</L>
<L>Requir'd a ma&s;ter's care,</L>
<L>The wicket, op'ning with a latch,</L>
<L>Receiv'd the harmle&s;s pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, when bu&s;y crowds retire</L>
<L>To take their evening re&s;t,</L>
<L>The hermit trim'd his little fire,</L>
<L>And chear'd his pen&s;ive gue&s;t;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;pread his vegetable &s;tore,</L>
<L>And gaily pre&s;t and &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>And, &s;kill'd in legendary lore,</L>
<L>The ling'ring hours beguil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While round, in &s;ympathetic mirth,</L>
<L>Its tricks the kitten tries,</L>
<L>The cricket chirrups in the hearth,</L>
<L>The crackling faggot flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But nothing mirthful could a&s;&s;uage</L>
<L>The pen&s;ive &s;tranger's woe,</L>
<L>For grief had &s;eiz'd his early age,</L>
<L>And tears would often flow.</L>

<PB N="4" REF="4">
<L>His ri&s;ing cares the hermit &s;py'd,</L>
<L>With an&s;wering care oppre&s;t;</L>
<L>And whence, unhappy youth, he cry'd,</L>
<L>The &s;orrows of thy brea&s;t?</L>
</LG>

<L>From better habitations &s;purn'd,</L>
<L>Reluctant do&s;t thou rove,</L>
<L>Or grieve for friend&s;hip unreturn'd,</L>
<L>Or unregarded love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, what is friend&s;hip? but a name,</L>
<L>A charm that lulls to &s;leep,</L>
<L>A &s;hade that follows wealth or fame,</L>
<L>But leaves the wretch to weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And what is love? an empty &s;ound,</L>
<L>The modern fair one's je&s;t;</L>
<L>On earth un&s;een, or only found</L>
<L>To warm the turtle's ne&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;hame, fond youth, thy &s;orrows hu&s;h,</L>

<L>Expanding to the view,</L>

<L>A maid in all her charms.</L>

<L>And ah! forgive a &s;tranger rude,</L>
<L>A thing forlorn, &s;he cried,</L>

<L>An heart's di&s;tre&s;s allay,</L>

<L>Companion of the way.</L>

<L>My father liv'd, of high degree</L>
<L>Remote be&s;ide the Tyne,</L>
<L>And as he had but only me,</L>
<L>Whate'er he had was mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To win me from his tender arms</L>
<L>Unnumber'd &s;uitors came,</L>
<L>Their chief pretence my flatter'd charms,</L>
<L>My wealth perhaps their aim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each hour the mercenary crowd</L>
<L>With glitt'ring proffers &s;trove;</L>
<L>Among the re&s;t young Edwin bow'd,</L>
<L>Who offer'd only love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<L>In humble &s;imple&s;t habit clad,</L>
<L>No wealth nor power had he;</L>
<L>Wi&s;dom and worth were all he had,</L>
<L>And the&s;e were all to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er he &s;poke amid&s;t the train,</L>
<L>How would my heart attend!</L>
<L>And &s;till delighted even to pain,</L>
<L>How &s;igh for &s;uch a friend!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when a little re&s;t I &s;ought</L>
<L>In &s;leep's refre&s;hing arms,</L>
<L>How have I mended what he taught,</L>
<L>And lent him fancied charms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;till (and woe betide the hour)</L>
<L>I &s;purn'd him from my &s;ide,</L>
<L>And &s;till with ill di&s;&s;embled power,</L>
<L>Repaid his love with pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Till, quite dejected with my &s;corn,</L>
<L>He left me to deplore,</L>
<L>And &s;ought a &s;olitude forlorn,</L>
<L>And ne'er was heard of more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then &s;ince he peri&s;h'd by my fault,</L>
<L>This pilgrimage I pay,</L>
<L>I'll &s;eek the &s;olitude he &s;ought,</L>

<PB N="7" REF="7">
<L>And there in &s;helt'ring thickets hid,</L>

<L>Turn, ANGELINA, ever dear,</L>
<L>My charmer, turn to &s;ee</L>
<L>Thy own, thy long-lo&s;t EDWIN here,</L>

<L>Here amid&s;t &s;ylvan bow'rs we'll rove,</L>

<L>And innocent as they.</L>
